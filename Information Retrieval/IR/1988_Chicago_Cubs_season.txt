The 1988 Chicago Cubs season was the 117th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 113th in the National League and the 73rd at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished fourth in the National League East with a record of 77â€“85, 24 
games behind the New York Mets. The first game under lights at Wrigley 
Field was on August 8 (8/8/88), against the Philadelphia Phillies. With 
the Cubs leading 3-1, in the middle of the 4th inning, a powerful thunderstorm 
rolled in. The game was suspended, and finally called at 10:25PM. Since 
the rules of Major League Baseball state that a game is not official unless 
5 innings are completed,[1] the first official night game in the history 
of Wrigley Field was played on August 9, when the Cubs defeated the New 
York Mets 6 to 4. President of the United States Ronald Reagan threw out 
the ceremonial first pitch on Opening Day. After 5,687 consecutive day 
games played by the Cubs at Wrigley, the lights were finally lit on August 
8, 1988, for a game with the Philadelphia Phillies. The game began before 
an announced crowd of 39,008. The Cubs were leading 3 to 1 and coming to 
bat in the bottom of the fourth when the rain delay began. The umpires 
called the game after waiting two hours, ten minutes.[7] The Cubs played 
the first official night game the following night against the Mets and 
won, 6-4. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB
