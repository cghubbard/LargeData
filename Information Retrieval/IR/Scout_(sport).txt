In professional sports, scouts are experienced talent evaluators who travel 
extensively for the purposes of watching athletes play their chosen sports 
and determining whether their set of skills and talents represent what 
is needed by the scout's organization. Some scouts are interested primarily 
in the selection of prospects, younger players who may require further 
development by the acquiring team but who are judged to be worthy of that 
effort and expense for the potential future payoff that it could bring, 
while others concentrate on players who are already polished professionals 
whose rights may be available soon, either through free agency or trading, 
and who are seen as filling a team's specific need at a certain position. 
Advance scouts watch the teams that their teams are going to play in order 
to help determine strategy. Many scouts are former coaches or retired players, 
while others have made a career just of being scouts. Skilled scouts who 
help to determine which players will fit in well with an organization can 
be the major difference between success and failure for the team with regard 
to wins and losses, which often relates directly to the organization's 
financial success or lack thereof as well. Scouts tend to have to perform 
one of two tasks, either scouting opposition teams to research the opposition's 
players and tactics, or scouting individual players to identify their level 
of skill and to keep track of potential new signings.[1] Contemporary Major 
League Baseball teams tend to classify scouts and their differing responsibilities 
as follows: According to Tony Lucadello, considered by some to be the greatest 
scout ever,[2][3][4][5] the four kinds of scouts start with the letter 
'P': Lucadello estimated that five percent of scouts were poor, five percent 
pickers, 85 percent performance scouts and five percent projectors.[6] 
Modern day scouts are becoming more and more reliant on computer programs 
to aid and assist in the evaluation of talent being scouted.[citation needed] 
Many professional sport clubs now use computers to organize their collected 
information and data.[citation needed] Most sports still depend on human 
management to decide which players their organization will draft or sign.[citation
