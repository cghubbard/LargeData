Peabody /ˈpiːbədi/ is a city in Essex County, Massachusetts, United States. 
At the 2010 census, the population was 51,251,[2] and in 2014 the estimated 
population was 52,376. Peabody is located in the North Shore region of 
Massachusetts. First known as the Northfields, "the Farms", and Brooksby, 
the area was settled about 1626 within Salem, which had itself been founded 
in 1626 and incorporated in 1629. In 1752, the area was set off from Salem 
and incorporated as part of Danvers. It was usually referred to as "the 
South Parish", associated with the church located in the center (now Peabody 
Square). In 1855, the community broke away from Danvers to become the town 
of South Danvers, incorporated that May 18. The name was changed on April 
30, 1868, to Peabody after George Peabody, a noted philanthropist. It would 
be incorporated as a city in 1916. The town began as a farming community, 
but its streams attracted mills which operated by water power. In particular, 
Peabody was a major center of New England's leather industry, which attracted 
immigrants from all around the world. By 1915, a third of the population 
was foreign-born.[3] In addition to becoming home to large Irish and Russian 
populations, Peabody notably developed a large community of laborers hailing 
from the Ottoman Empire, mostly Turkish- and Kurdish-speakers from the 
region of Harput (now known as Elazığ).[3] The population was situated 
primarily on Walnut Street, where they filled boarding houses and coffee 
houses to such an extent that it became known as "Ottoman Street," and, 
more pejoratively and less accurately, "Peabody's Barbary Coast."[3] One 
visitor even noted that signs in town were written in both English and 
Ottoman Turkish.[3] On the morning of October 28, 1915, 21 young girls 
lost their lives in a fire at the St. John's School on Chestnut Street 
in the downtown area. The 21 girls who were trapped were found after the 
fire subsided, huddled together and burnt beyond recognition, on the other 
side of the entrance - just steps away from survival. All the teachers 
escaped with their lives. The students' deaths were privately mourned in 
Peabody and were rarely mentioned, as many tried to forget the tragedy. 
Because of this, Peabody became the first city to make a law that said 
all doors must push out.[4][5] The tanneries that helped create Peabody's 
"Ottoman Street" remained a linchpin of the city's economy into the second 
half of the 20th century. The tanneries have since closed, but the city 
remains known locally as the Leather City or Tanner City, and its high 
school sports teams are nicknamed the Tanners which continues to be the 
mascot today. The loss of the tanneries was a blow to Peabody's economy, 
but the city has made up for the erosion of its industrial base, at least 
in part, through other forms of economic development. Early in the 20th 
century, it joined the automobile revolution, hosting the pioneer Brass 
Era company the Corwin Manufacturing Company.[6] The Northshore Mall, originally 
the Northshore Shopping Center, is one of the region's largest malls. It 
opened in 1958 and is now the city's largest taxpayer. Centennial Park,[7] 
an industrial park in the center of the city, has attracted several medical 
and technology companies. Meanwhile, West Peabody, which was mostly farmland 
as recently as the 1950s, has been developed into a middle-to-upper class 
residential area. Brooksby Farm,[8] a historic farm managed by the City 
of Peabody, is a 275-acre (1.11 km2) working farm and conservation area 
that has been one of the city's most popular destinations for decades. 
Peabody is the location of the Salem Country Club, a private country club 
with a professional golf course. In the past, the club has hosted the U.S. 
Senior Open in 2001 and the U.S. Women's Open in 1954 and 1984. City Hall
