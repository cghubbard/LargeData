The 2015 Chicago White Sox season was the club's 116th season in Chicago 
and 115th in the American League. The 2014 Chicago White Sox ended with 
a 73-89 record, a 10-game improvement over 2013.[2] General Manager Rick 
Hahn gave the season a "fail" grade, citing the lack of a championship.[3] 
The White Sox front office set up an "aggressive" offseason plan, focusing 
on improving a bullpen that blew 21 saves and had the 3rd-worst earned 
run average in baseball.[4] Despite losing 188 games the previous two seasons, 
Robin Ventura is set to remain as manager for the 2015 season.[5] The White 
Sox offseason started at the end of October when Moises Sierra was claimed 
by the Kansas City Royals off waivers.[6] Shortly following this, the Sox 
declined Felipe Paulino's option for 2015, after going 0-2 in just four 
starts.[7] Reliever Matt Lindstrom also elected free agency at the end 
of the month after an ankle injury kept him off the mound for most of 2014.[8] 
On November 3, the White Sox claimed outfielder J. B. Shuck off waivers 
from the Cleveland Indians.[9] Two weeks later, the team began its quest 
to improve the bullpen by signing free agent reliever Zach Duke to a three 
year/$15 million contract.[10] The rest of November included mostly minor 
league moves, until the White Sox signed free agent first baseman Adam 
LaRoche to a two year/$25 million contract on November 25.[11] The corresponding 
roster move was to designate pitcher Scott Carroll for assignment, who 
would later become a free agent.[12] The 2014 Winter Meetings ran from 
December 7–11 in San Diego.[13] The White Sox' first move of the Winter 
Meetings was to claim catcher Rob Brantly of waivers from Miami.[14] Late 
that night, there were rumors that the White Sox were close to singing 
David Robertson from the New York Yankees as well as trading for Jeff Samardzija 
from the Oakland Athletics.[15] On December 9, the club officially announced 
a four-year, $46 million contract with Robertson and acquired pitchers 
Jeff Samardzija and Michael Ynoa from Oakland for infielders Marcus Semien 
and Rangel Ravelo, catcher Josh Phegley and pitcher Chris Bassitt.[16] 
They finished off the Winter Meetings by trading pitcher Andre Rienzo to 
Miami for pitcher Dan Jennings.[17] On December 16, the White Sox announced 
the signing of outfielder Melky Cabrera to a three-year, $42 million contract.[18] 
The White Sox cited the increase in ticket sales following the Robertson 
and Samardzija signings as motivation for signing Cabrera.[19] On January 
5, 2015, the club signed infielder Emilio Bonifacio to a one-year, $4 million 
contract. The last major move of the off-season was a surprise, as the 
White Sox signed infielder Gordon Beckham, whom they had traded to the 
Los Angeles Angels just a few months prior, to a one-year, $2 million contract 
and designated outfielder Dayán Viciedo for assignment.[20] On October 
30, the Baseball Hall of Fame announced the 10 candidates for election 
via the Golden Era Committee. Among the candidates were White Sox legends 
Minnie Miñoso and Billy Pierce; Dick Allen, who won the 1972 American League 
Most Valuable Player award; and Jim Kaat, who played two and a half seasons 
with the White Sox.[21] On December 8, the Hall of Fame announced that 
none of the candidates earned the required 12 voters, with Allen earning 
11 votes, Kaat earning 10, Minoso earning 8, and Pierce receiving less 
than 3.[22] White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf was "disappointed" in the 
results, particularly the rejection of 90-year-old Minoso, saying "I don’t 
know what player out of the era of the 1950s and early ’60s would be more 
deserving than Minnie."[23] On December 7, the media reported that the 
White Sox had denied the Toronto Blue Jays permission to interview Executive 
Vice President Ken Williams for their opening at club President.[24] Reinsdorf 
was reportedly upset that the Blue Jays asked for permission during the 
Winter Meetings. When he talked to Williams about it, Williams said that 
Toronto had already contacted him, which is considered tampering under 
Major League Baseball rules.[25] The White Sox opted not to pursue recourse. 
On February 19, the club released their 2015 broadcast schedule, with 106 
games on Comcast SportsNet Chicago, 35 games on WGN-TV, and 20 games on 
WPWR-TV.[26] This is a change from previous seasons, where a small amount 
of WGN produced games were broadcast on WCIU-TV instead of WPWR. It had 
previously been announced that games on WGN-TV would no longer be simulcast 
nationally on WGN America, ending Major League Baseball's superstation 
era.[27] Spanish radio broadcasts switched from WEBG (formerly WNUA) back 
to 1200 WRTO-AM. On March 1, White Sox legend Minnie Miñoso died early 
in the morning due to a heart-related issue.[28] Hundreds of Sox fans attended 
the funeral of "Mr. White Sox" on March 7.[29] Infielders Outfielders Coaches
