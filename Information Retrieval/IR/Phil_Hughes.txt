Philip Joseph "Phil" Hughes (born June 24, 1986) is an American right-handed 
professional baseball pitcher for the Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He played in MLB for the New York Yankees from 2007 through 2013. 
He stands 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) tall and weighs 240 pounds (110 kg). 
He was the Yankees' first-round pick in the 2004 MLB draft. During his 
time in the Yankees' minor-league system, Hughes was one of the most highly 
anticipated prospects in baseball, but his major league career has thus 
far been marked by inconsistency. He debuted in the major leagues in 2007 
as a starting pitcher and quickly demonstrated his potential with a bid 
for a no-hitter in only his second MLB start. However, injury cut short 
his outing, as well as significant portions of his 2007 and 2008 seasons. 
Hughes began 2009 in the minors but later returned to the major leagues, 
eventually converting to a relief pitcher in June; pitching as a setup 
man for Mariano Rivera, Hughes excelled in the new role during the regular 
season. Despite his struggles in the postseason, Hughes won a championship 
with the Yankees in the 2009 World Series over the Philadelphia Phillies. 
Upon returning to the starting rotation in 2010, he won 18 games and earned 
his first All-Star selection. Arm fatigue cost Hughes nearly half of the 
season in 2011, but the following year, he stayed healthy for the entire 
season, winning 16 games as the Yankees' third starter. In 2013, he had 
his worst season, posting a 4–14 win–loss record and 5.19 earned run average, 
a performance that led to him being removed from the rotation. The following 
year, Hughes had a turnaround season with the Twins, where he went 16-10 
with an ERA of 3.52 that resulted in him placing 7th in American League 
Cy Young Award voting.[1] Hughes was born in Mission Viejo, California 
on June 24, 1986, and attended Foothill High School in Santa Ana, California, 
where he was a first-team High School All-American pitcher and had one 
perfect game.[2] In his junior year (2003), he had a 12–0 record and posted 
an 0.78 earned run average (ERA) while striking out 85 batters in 72 innings. 
In his senior year (2004), he had an 0.69 ERA and a 9–1 record. In 61 innings, 
he gave up 41 hits and three walks while striking out 83 batters.[3] Hughes 
first committed to Santa Clara University, but he chose to sign with the 
New York Yankees when they selected him in the first round, with the 23rd 
overall selection, of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft.[3] The Yankees 
were awarded this pick as compensation when free agent pitcher Andy Pettitte 
signed with the Houston Astros.[4][5] In 2004, Hughes pitched five scoreless 
innings for the rookie Gulf Coast League Yankees, striking out eight hitters. 
He spent 2005, his first full professional year, between the Class A Charleston 
RiverDogs and the Advanced A Tampa Yankees. He had a 9–2 record and a 1.24 
ERA, and in 85 1⁄3 innings he gave up 54 hits while striking out 93.[6] 
After attending spring training with the Yankees in 2006, Hughes began 
the season with Tampa. He was promoted to the Double-A Trenton Thunder 
of the Eastern League at the beginning of May after he had a 2–3 record 
and a 1.80 ERA with Tampa while striking out 30 batters in 30 innings.[2][7] 
On June 13, Hughes took a no-hitter into the sixth inning and threw a one-hitter 
through seven innings in a 3–0 victory over the New Hampshire Fisher Cats.[8] 
Ten days later, he put forth another dominant start, taking a no-hitter 
into the eighth inning and pitching eight shutout innings in a 4–0 win 
over the Connecticut Defenders.[9] With Trenton, Hughes had a 10–3 record, 
a 2.25 ERA, and 138 strikeouts in 116 innings.[2] He made one appearance 
in the Eastern League playoffs, earning a no-decision after pitching six 
innings of 1-run ball with 13 strikeouts.[10] The game was the only postseason 
victory for the Thunder that year.[11] After the season, he won the Kevin 
Lawn "Pitcher of the Year" Award as the top Yankees' minor league pitcher.[12] 
Entering 2007, Baseball America rated Hughes the Yankees' #1 prospect, 
said he had the best curveball and best control in the Yankee system, and 
called him "arguably the best pitching prospect in the minors."[13] Baseball 
America also named him the fourth-best prospect in baseball.[14] MiLB.com 
named Hughes the top right-handed starting pitching prospect in the AL 
East farm systems.[15] In January 2007, the Yankees announced that Hughes 
was being invited to spring training.[16] According to Bryan Hoch of MLB.com, 
scouts believed that Hughes was ready for the major leagues, but Yankees' 
general manager Brian Cashman said it was "unlikely" that Hughes would 
play for the Yankees in April.[17] Hughes began 2007 pitching for the Triple-A 
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the International League (IL).[2] Following 
injuries to several Yankees' starters in 2007, Hughes was called up in 
April.[18] Hughes made his major league debut on April 26 against the Toronto 
Blue Jays. In 4 1⁄3 innings, he allowed four runs on seven hits, earning 
his first career loss.[19] In his second major league start on May 1 against 
the Texas Rangers, he was maintaining a no-hitter through 6 1⁄3 innings 
before pulling his left hamstring while facing his future teammate Mark 
Teixeira. Mike Myers later allowed a hit, but Hughes earned his first career 
win.[20] After the game, he was placed on the disabled list (DL).[21] He 
returned on August 4 against the Kansas City Royals, allowing six runs 
in 4 2⁄3 innings and earning a no-decision in a 16–8 victory.[22] In his 
final start of the year, on September 27 against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 
he allowed one run in a season-high seven innings and earned the win in 
a 3–1 victory.[23] In 17 starts for the Yankees, Hughes had a 5–3 record, 
a 4.46 ERA, and 58 strikeouts in 72 2⁄3 innings pitched.[2] He was the 
second-youngest American League (AL) player in 2007.[24] Hughes was included 
on the Yankees' postseason roster as a long reliever.[25] He made his first 
postseason appearance in 2007 against the Cleveland Indians in the AL Division 
Series (ALDS), giving up one run in two innings in Game 1, a 12–3 loss.[26] 
In Game 3, Hughes (the youngest player on the Yankees' roster) relieved 
an injured Roger Clemens (the oldest player on the roster) in the third 
inning and pitched 3 2⁄3 scoreless innings. He struck out four and earned 
his first playoff win.[27] The Yankees were eliminated in four games in 
the series.[28] Prior to the 2008 season, it was reported by numerous news 
sources that the Yankees were thinking of including Hughes in a trade to 
the Minnesota Twins for Johan Santana.[29] The trade never happened; Santana 
was traded to the New York Mets instead.[30] Hughes began the 2008 season 
as the third starter in the Yankees' rotation.[31] In his first six starts, 
he had an 0–4 record and a 9.00 ERA.[32] On April 30, he was placed on 
the disabled list with a strained oblique and cracked rib.[33] On a May 
2 visit to an optometrist, Hughes was found to be slightly nearsighted; 
as a result, he started wearing glasses on the mound.[34] After recovering 
from the rib injury, Hughes pitched for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre; he helped 
them win the 2008 International League title, earning the win after striking 
out 12 batters in the clinching game. On September 13, a day after the 
IL playoffs, Hughes was recalled by the Yankees.[35] On September 17, Hughes 
made his first start since April 29, giving up one earned run over four 
innings and earning a no-decision in a 5–1 victory over the Chicago White 
Sox.[36] In his final start of the season, on September 24, he gave up 
two runs in eight innings and received a no-decision in a ten-inning, 6–2 
victory over Toronto.[37] He finished the season with an 0–4 record, a 
6.62 ERA, 23 strikeouts, and 34 innings pitched in eight starts.[2] Because 
injuries severely limited his workload during the season, the Yankees sent 
Hughes to the Arizona Fall League after the season to pitch more innings.[38] 
Although he had a solid performance in spring training, Hughes began the 
2009 season in Triple-A.[39] He was called up to the majors in April after 
Chien-Ming Wang was placed on the disabled list. Hughes made his first 
start of the season on April 28 against the Detroit Tigers and pitched 
six scoreless innings, earning his first win since 2007 in an 11–0 victory.[40] 
On May 25, Hughes threw eight scoreless innings, earning the win in an 
11–1 victory over the Rangers.[41] After he posted a 3–2 record and a 5.45 
ERA in seven starts, Hughes was moved to the bullpen when Wang returned 
to the rotation in early June.[42][43] Hughes pitched well, becoming the 
primary setup man to Mariano Rivera in July due to injuries to Brian Bruney 
and Dámaso Marte.[44] Despite his success as a reliever, Cashman maintained 
that Hughes would be a starter over the long-term.[45] Hughes's first regular 
season win in relief came on July 17, when he threw two scoreless innings 
in a 5–3 victory over Detroit.[46] On July 23, he recorded his first career 
save after a 6–3 Yankees victory over the Oakland Athletics. He relieved 
CC Sabathia in the eighth inning and pitched two perfect innings.[44] From 
June 10 through July 3, he had a 25 1⁄3 inning scoreless streak, the longest 
by a Yankee reliever since Rivera had a 30 2⁄3 inning scoreless streak 
in 1999.[2][47] In 44 games as a relief pitcher in 2009, Hughes posted 
a 1.40 ERA; he had 65 strikeouts in 51 1⁄3 innings.[42] Hughes pitched 
in all three games of the ALDS against the Minnesota Twins, posting a 9.00 
ERA.[48] In Game 5 of the AL Championship Series (ALCS) against the Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim, he suffered a loss when he gave up a run and 
also allowed an inherited runner to score in the 7–6 defeat.[49] He had 
scoreless outings in Games 2 and 3 as the Yankees won the series in six 
games.[48][50] He had a 16.20 ERA in the World Series, but he won his first 
World Series ring as the Yankees defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in 
six games.[48][51] On March 25, 2010, Hughes was named the Yankees' fifth 
starter.[52] Throughout the season, the Yankees occasionally had Hughes 
skip starts to limit his innings, in hopes that this would help him stay 
healthy.[53] On April 21, Hughes carried a no-hitter into the eighth inning 
against the Athletics before allowing a leadoff single to Eric Chavez; 
he faced two more hitters prior to being relieved, having struck out 10 
batters.[54] He won his first five decisions, a streak snapped May 22 by 
the New York Mets.[55] He followed with another five-game win streak, the 
last coming against the Mets on June 19.[56] After missing a start, he 
saw this win streak come to an end June 29 against the Seattle Mariners.[57] 
Hughes was named to the AL All-Star Team, Sunday, July 4. Five days after 
his first selection to the midsummer classic, Hughes threw seven innings 
and gave up one run to beat the Mariners 6–1.[58] His next outing, the 
All-Star Game, did not go well. Hughes, after retiring the first batter 
he faced in the seventh inning, allowed a pair of singles to Scott Rolen 
and Matt Holliday before yielding to Matt Thornton; Rolen and Holliday 
scored the tying and go-ahead runs on Brian McCann's three-run double that 
proved decisive in the NL's 3–1 victory.[59] On August 14, Hughes allowed 
three runs in six innings, earning the win in an 8–3 victory over the Kansas 
City Royals.[60] It was the 50th start of Hughes's career, making him at 
24 years and 51 days old the youngest Yankee to make his 50th start since 
Al Downing made his 50th start at 23 years and 61 days old in 1964.[2][61] 
Hughes had 18 wins (tied for fourth in the AL with Trevor Cahill and Justin 
Verlander behind Sabathia, who had 21, and Jon Lester and David Price, 
who both had 19), only 8 losses, and a 4.19 ERA while striking out 146 
batters in 176 1⁄3 innings of work.[2][62] His run support of 6.48 runs 
per game was the highest in the major leagues.[63] Hughes made his first 
postseason start in Game 3 of the ALDS against the Twins. He threw seven 
shutout innings to earn the win in the clinching game of the series as 
the Yankees beat the Twins 6–1.[64] Game 2 of the ALCS against the Rangers 
did not go as well for Hughes, who allowed seven runs in four innings and 
earned the loss as the Yankees were defeated 7–2.[65] He allowed four runs 
in 4 2⁄3 innings in Game 6 and earned another loss as the Yankees lost 
6–1 and were eliminated from the postseason.[66] Hughes, who began as the 
third starter in the 2011 season, suffered from a dip in velocity. His 
four-seam fastball averaged only 89 mph and peaked at 92 mph after three 
starts, compared to his usual 92–95 mph. After opening the season 0–1 with 
a 13.94 ERA in three starts, Hughes was placed on the DL due to a dead 
arm syndrome.[67] It was later revealed that Hughes had been suffering 
from shoulder inflammation. He underwent an arm strength rehabilitation 
program for several weeks. On July 6, he made his first start in nearly 
3 months, pitching five innings, allowing two earned runs, striking out 
and walking two batters, in a 5–3 loss to the Cleveland Indians.[68] On 
August 2, in a rain-shortened game, Hughes threw his first career shutout 
as the Yankees defeated the White Sox 6–0 in six innings.[69] Late in September, 
Hughes was moved to the bullpen after back stiffness caused him to miss 
a start.[70] In 17 games (14 starts), Hughes had a 5–5 record, a 5.79 ERA, 
and 47 strikeouts in 74 2⁄3 innings pitched.[2] Hughes was included on 
the Yankees' postseason roster as a relief pitcher.[71] He had scoreless 
outings in Games 4 and 5 of the ALDS as the Yankees were defeated by the 
Detroit Tigers in five games.[48] On January 16, 2012, Hughes signed a 
one-year deal worth $3.25 million that included incentives, effectively 
avoiding arbitration. His deal was a $500,000 raise from his disappointing 
2011 season.[72] Hughes was the Yankees' third starter in 2012.[73] He 
started the season averaging only four innings in his first four starts 
while posting a 1–3 record and a 7.88 ERA. From May to the end of the season, 
however, Hughes had a 15–10 record and a 3.90 ERA. He had a season-high 
four-game winning streak from May 22 through June 15.[74] Hughes threw 
a complete game on June 3, allowing one run in a 5–1 win against the Tigers.[75] 
On June 26, he threw eight shutout innings and earned the win in a 6–4 
victory over Cleveland.[76] He threw 7 1⁄3 shutout innings and earned the 
win on September 13 in a 2–0 victory over the Boston Red Sox.[77] In 32 
starts, Hughes had a 4.19 ERA and 165 strikeouts in 191 1⁄3 innings pitched.[2] 
He was tied for sixth in the AL in wins (16, with Max Scherzer, Yu Darvish, 
and Hiroki Kuroda), but he also tied for eighth in the league in losses 
(13, with Dan Haren and Ervin Santana).[78] In Game 4 of the ALDS against 
the Baltimore Orioles, Hughes allowed one run in 6 2⁄3 innings but received 
a no-decision in a 13-inning, 2–1 loss. The Yankees won the series in five 
games. In Game 3 of the ALCS against Detroit, Hughes allowed one run in 
three innings before exiting with back stiffness; he took the loss as the 
Yankees lost 2–1.[79] The Tigers swept the Yankees in four games.[80] Hughes 
began the 2013 season on the DL with a bulging disc in his back.[81] He 
returned from the DL on April 6, allowing four runs (three earned) in four 
plus innings and earning the loss as Detroit won 8–4.[82] On May 15 against 
the Seattle Mariners, Hughes only lasted 2⁄3 of an inning after giving 
up 7 runs, 6 hits, 2 walks, including a grand slam to former Yankee Raúl 
Ibañez in a 12–2 Yankee loss. It was the shortest start of his career and 
at the time the shortest non-injury start by a Yankee at the new Yankee 
Stadium.[83] After pitching to a 4-13 record and a 4.86 ERA, with a 5.71 
ERA in the second half, the Yankees removed Hughes from the rotation on 
September 4, replacing him with David Huff.[84] Hughes went 1–10 in home 
starts in 2013, making him just the second MLB pitcher to win fewer than 
two games when making at least 15 home starts in a season; the other being 
Phil Huffman of the Toronto Blue Jays in 1979.[85] He has the third-highest 
ERA in Yankee history among pitchers with at least 500 innings pitched.[86] 
Hughes agreed to a three-year contract worth $24 million with the Minnesota 
Twins on November 30, 2013. The deal was confirmed by the Twins on December 
5, 2013.[87] The 2014 season was arguably the best season for Hughes, pitching 
to a 3.52 ERA in 209 2/3 innings.[1] On September 24, 2014 Hughes ended 
the season with the best strikeout-to-walk ratio ratio in a single season 
in MLB history (11.625).[88] Hughes finished 7th in Cy Young Award voting, 
leading all MLB nominees in bases on balls per 9 innings pitched (0.687).[89] 
On December 22, 2014 Hughes and the Twins agreed on a three-year extension 
worth $42 million.[90] Looking to build on the success of his 2014 season, 
Hughes went into the 2015 season as the Twins ace. Hughes had lost velocity 
in his fastball, dropping from 93MPH to 92MPH. His 2015 season was marred 
with inconsistency and injury as he only started 25 times while appearing 
2 times out of the bullpen. Despite going 11-9, his ERA was 4.40 and he 
served up 29 home runs in only 155.1 innings. On June 9, 2016, Hughes was 
struck in the left knee off a line drive from J.T. Realmuto and left the 
game. The next day, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to left 
knee contusion. He was ruled out for 6-8 weeks. On June 11, it was revealed 
that there was a non-displaced fracture of the femur in the left knee. 
On June 12, he was transferred to the 60-day disabled list. On June 28th, 
Hughes' season was declared over as he was set to undergo season ending 
surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome. He finished the 2016 season with 
a 1-7 record for the Twins. As a child, Hughes was a Boston Red Sox fan. 
He had a poster of Nomar Garciaparra with the slogan "Reverse the Curse" 
on his bedroom wall.[91] Hughes is a Christian. His baseball glove has 
the reference for the Bible verse Philippians 4:13 on it, and Hughes has 
the entire verse ("I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.") 
tattooed on his left arm.[24] He enjoys watching the Food Network and is 
a fan of Alton Brown.[92] Hughes's pitch repertoire has varied over the 
years, although his main pitch has consistently been a four-seam fastball 
at 92–95 mph, and he has also relied on a spike curveball in the range 
of 73–77 mph. He has also developed a mid-80s Vulcan changeup against left-handed 
hitters, and in mid-2012 he developed a low-80s slider to right-handers.[93][94] 
Hughes added a cut fastball in the high 80s as a weapon against right-handers 
in the 2008 season, and he used the pitch 16% of the time in the 2009 and 
2010 seasons:[93] By early 2011, Hughes's velocity on his fastball was 
down several mph; John Harper of the New York Daily News speculated that 
Hughes's overuse of the cutter was to blame, not a dead arm.[95] Hughes 
continued to use the cutter into the start of the 2012 season; he posted 
a 7.88 ERA in April, throwing the cutter about 12% of the time in this 
span.[74][96] In early May, Hughes dropped the cutter from his repertoire, 
using it only 1.2% of the time for the rest of the year.[97][98] Hughes 
throws a disproportionate number of his pitches high in the strike zone 
and above the zone.[99] Hughes asserts that the hamstring injury he suffered 
in his rookie year has permanently altered his pitching mechanics: "My
