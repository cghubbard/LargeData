The 1987 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 106th season in St. 
Louis, Missouri and the 96th season in the National League. The Cardinals 
went 95-67 during the season and finished first in the National League 
East Division for the third and last time before moving to the NL Central 
in 1994. They went on to win the NLCS in seven games over the San Francisco 
Giants. In the World Series against the Minnesota Twins, after having fallen 
behind 2-0 at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, they won their next three 
games at home. However, back at the Metrodome, they lost the last two and 
fell one game short of a World Series title. It would be the Cardinals' 
last World Series appearance until 2004. September highlights included 
a Terry Pendleton home run on a September 11 game against the contending 
Mets as well as a Tom Herr walk-off grand slam against the Mets on Seat 
Cushion Night. As St. Louis proceeded into the post-season, they found 
themselves without clean-up hitter Jack Clark, the team's number-one offensive 
threat. He damaged his ankle when he caught a cleat in the artificial turf 
at Montreal's Olympic Stadium.[4] Nonetheless, the Redbirds won 95 games 
to capture the NL East title. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position;

defeated the Cardinals in seven games. This Series was the first in which 
the home team won each of the seven games. The Cardinals held their own 
at Busch Stadium, but the electronically enhanced crowd noise and the "Homer 
Hankies" in the Metrodome appeared to the give the Twins an edge. The booming 
bats of the Twins were too much for the Cardinals' "inside baseball" style 
of offense in Games 1, 2, and 6. In Game 7 it was the Twins' pitching that 
shut down the Cardinals. AL Minnesota Twins (4) vs. NL St. Louis Cardinals
