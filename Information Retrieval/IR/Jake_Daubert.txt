Jacob Ellsworth Daubert (April 7, 1884 – October 9, 1924) was an American 
first baseman in Major League Baseball who played for the Brooklyn Superbas[1] 
and Cincinnati Reds. His career lasted from 1910 until his death in 1924. 
Daubert was recognized throughout his career for his performances on the 
field. He won the 1913 and 1914 National League batting titles, as well 
as the 1913 Chalmers Award. Between 1911 and 1919, The Baseball Magazine 
named him to their All-American team seven times.[2] Baseball historian 
William C. Kashatus observed that Daubert was "a steady .300 hitter for 
10 years of the Deadball Era", who "never fielded below the .989 mark" 
during the same period.[3] Daubert was born in Shamokin, Pennsylvania, 
to Jacob and Sarah Daubert. The lack of child labor laws enabled Daubert 
to go to work early in his life. In 1895, at the age of eleven, the young 
Daubert joined his father and two brothers at work in the local coal mines.[4] 
In 1906, Daubert left his job at the mines and signed a contract with a 
baseball team in Lykens, Pennsylvania.[5] He was originally a pitcher on 
the team before he converted to first base.[4] At the end of the 1906 season, 
Daubert left Pennsylvania and traveled west to Ohio. There, he spent the 
1907 season on teams in Kane, Pennsylvania and Marion, Ohio.[5] In 1908, 
Daubert was signed by the Cleveland Indians. However, Daubert never played 
for Cleveland as they released him shortly thereafter. He left Cleveland 
and signed with the Nashville club of the Southern Association. He spent 
the remainder of the season with Nashville.[4] Daubert returned to Ohio 
for the start of the 1909 season. After playing the first part of the season 
with Toledo of the American Association, Daubert went back to Tennessee 
and joined the Memphis club. Like Nashville, Memphis' team played in the 
Southern Association. While playing for Memphis, Larry Sutton, a scout 
for the Brooklyn Dodgers, observed his play. Shortly thereafter, the Dodgers 
purchased Daubert's contract and brought him to Brooklyn for the 1910 season.[4] 
While Daubert hit just .264 in 1910, he hit over .300 in each of the next 
six seasons. On May 6, 1910, Daubert recorded 21 putouts in a single game, 
one short of the major league record.[6] In 1911 and 1912, Daubert placed 
ninth and eighth in the Chalmers Award voting.[7][8] The following year, 
he won the award. On August 15, 1914, Daubert tied Cy Seymour's MLB record 
with four sacrifice bunts in one game.[9] In 1916 he batted .316 and Brooklyn 
won their first NL pennant; but he hit only .176 in the 1916 World Series 
and Brooklyn lost the series to the Boston Red Sox. Daubert hit .261 in 
1917, but the following year he hit .308 and led the NL in triples. When 
the season was cut short due to World War I and the influenza epidemic, 
major league owners prorated player salaries. Daubert, who had been among 
the founding members of the Players' Fraternity, sued for the balance of 
his salary. Eventually, Jake recovered most of the $2,150 he was due.[4] 
After the dispute started, Brooklyn owner Charles Ebbets traded him to 
Cincinnati for outfielder Tommy Griffith. Once in Cincinnati, Daubert served 
as the Reds' captain for the remainder of his career.[5] In 1919, although 
he hit only .276, Daubert was second in the league in runs scored and third 
in triples. The Reds won their first pennant since the inaugural season 
of the American Association in 1882. In the 1919 World Series, noted for 
the Black Sox Scandal, he batted .241. In the 9-1 Game 1 victory, he had 
three hits including a triple, and he had two hits and scored twice in 
the final 10-5 victory in Game 8. Daubert hit over .300 in the next three 
seasons. In 1922, Daubert hit for a .336 average, led the NL in triples 
and had a career-high 12 home runs. By 1923, at age 39, he was the oldest 
regular position player in the major leagues,[10] and he hit .292 that 
season. Daubert also excelled in sacrifice hits. His career total of 392 
sacrifice hits is second in MLB history, behind Hall of Famer Eddie Collins.[11] 
In his career, he had 56 home runs, 1117 runs, 722 runs batted in, 250 
doubles and 251 stolen bases. When he left Brooklyn for Cincinnati, Daubert 
held the Brooklyn franchise record for games played at first base (1206). 
The record was broken by Gil Hodges in 1956. Daubert was a trailblazer 
in baseball's unionization movement—a controversial role that may have 
been a factor in his omission from the Hall of Fame.[12] In 1913, he served 
as vice president of the Baseball Players' Fraternity, which petitioned 
the National Baseball Commission for improved labor conditions.[12] The 
petition included the following requests: 1) permission for players to 
negotiate with any team following their unconditional release, 2) a guarantee 
that clubs would provide players with 10 days' notice before releasing 
them unconditionally, 3) a guarantee that clubs would inform players of 
the terms of their contract when they are sent to another team, 4) a guarantee 
that a veteran players would not be sent to the minor leagues when his 
services are of interest to another major league club, 5) a guarantee that 
clubs would furnish uniforms and shoes to players free of charge, 6) a 
guarantee that clubs would provide traveling expenses to players between 
their homes and spring training camps, and 7) that players should receive 
written notice concerning any fine or suspension levied against them.[12] 
Although Daubert was unsuccessful in pressuring the commissioners to accept 
the terms of the fledgling baseball union's petition, he lobbied continuously 
for his own interests as a player, thereby earning a reputation as a "troublemaker" 
within the baseball establishment.[12] A salary dispute with the Charles 
Ebbets, owner of the Dodgers, was a major factor in Daubert's transfer 
to Cincinnati in 1919.[12] While Daubert was in Brooklyn, he was nominated 
for city Alderman.[4] He also spent time as a businessman and invested 
in several business ventures. His holdings included a pool hall, a cigar 
business, a semi-pro baseball team, a moving picture business, and a coal 
washery. His most profitable business was reportedly the coal washer, which 
was located in his hometown.[4] Daubert left the Reds late in the 1924 
season after falling ill during a road trip to New York.[13] Against his 
doctor's advice, he returned to play in the team's final home game of the 
season.[13] On October 2, he had an appendectomy performed by Dr. Harry 
H. Hines, the Reds' team doctor.[13] Complications from the operation arose, 
and a blood transfusion did not improve his health.[13] He died one week 
after the operation in Cincinnati, with the doctor citing "exhaustion, 
resulting in indigestion, [as] the immediate cause of death".[13] It has 
turned out that Daubert suffered from a hereditary blood disorder called 
hemolytic spherocytosis, which contributed to his death.[14] He was interred 
at the Charles Baber Cemetery in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.[15] Daubert 
was survived by his wife Gertrude, his son George, and his daughter Louisa.[4] 
During his career, Daubert compiled a .303 lifetime batting average. At 
the time of his death, he ranked among the major league career leaders 
in games (4th, 2001), putouts (4th, 19634), assists (5th, 1128), total 
chances (4th, 20943) and double plays (3rd, 1199) at first base; he was 
also among the NL's leaders in hits (7th, 2326), triples (9th, 165), at 
bats (9th, 7673), games played (10th, 2014) and total bases (10th, 3074). 
Daubert currently holds the NL record for most sacrifice hits (392). He 
was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1966[16] and the
