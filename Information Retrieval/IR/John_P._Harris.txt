John Paul Harris (died January 26, 1926 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) was 
a Pittsburgh businessman and politician who opened the world's first theater 
devoted entirely to showing Motion pictures.[1] Harris' work in the entertainment 
industry began at Harris Comedy and Specialty Co., a company run by his 
father that produced vaudeville shows. In 1897 Harris Comedy and Specialty 
Co. showed Pittsburgh's first motion picture. On June 19, 1905, Harris 
and his brother-in-law, Harry Davis opened a small film theatre on a Smithfield 
Street storefront in Downtown Pittsburgh. The theatre, known as the Nickelodeon, 
was the first devoted exclusively for the exhibition of movies.[2] In addition 
to owning theaters, Harris held shares in two National League baseball 
clubs. From November 15, 1910 to December 17, 1910, Harris served as the 
principal owner of the Boston Doves.[3][4] Following his sale of the Boston 
club, Harris purchased interest in the Pittsburgh Pirates.[4] Harris was 
also involved in politics. From 1922 until his death he represented the 
45th District in the Pennsylvania State Senate.[5] The Harris Theater in 
Pittsburgh is named in honor of Harris.[6] The John P. Harris Film Society,
