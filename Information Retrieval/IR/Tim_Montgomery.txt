Timothy "Tim" Montgomery (born January 28, 1975) is an American former 
track and field sprinter who specialized in the 100-meter dash. In 2005, 
he was stripped of his records—including a now void men's 100 m world record 
of 9.78 seconds set in 2002—after being found guilty of using performance-enhancing 
drugs as a central figure in the BALCO scandal. Since retiring from athletics, 
he has been tried and convicted for his part in a New York-based check 
fraud scheme and for dealing heroin in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia. 
Montgomery's first major medal was an Olympic silver in the 4 × 100 metres 
relay from the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. He was a 100 m bronze medalist at 
the 1997 World Championships in Athletics, then shared in the relay gold 
medals with the United States team at the 1999 World Championships in Athletics. 
He took an Olympic gold at the 2000 Summer Olympics with the American relay 
team. He initially won a silver medal in the 100 m at the 2001 World Championships 
in Athletics, but this was annulled due to doping. His official personal 
best for the 100 m stands at 9.92 seconds, making him a sub-10 second sprinter. 
Born in Gaffney, South Carolina, Montgomery was initially a basketball 
and football player, before trying out for track. Montgomery studied at 
Blinn College in Brenham, Texas, and transferred to Norfolk State University 
in 1994. Located in the Hampton Roads area of the Virginia port city of 
Norfolk, Norfolk State was known for its strong track program. While in 
school, he competed in several junior track events, and did well in the 
sprint and relay events. Montgomery did not qualify for the 1996 Summer 
Olympics 100 meters, although he did compete in Atlanta in the heats of 
the 4 x 100 metres relay team that eventually finished second behind Canada. 
He qualified for his first major international tournament in 1997, and 
won the bronze medal at those World Championships, finishing third behind 
Maurice Greene. Two years later, he came in sixth in the individual final, 
but did win a gold medal with the US relay team. Montgomery did not qualify 
for the individual 100 m at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, though 
he again ran as an alternate in the heats of the relay event; in the final, 
the USA won the gold medal. Montgomery broke Greene's 100 m world record 
by 0.01 seconds in September 2002. With a tailwind of 2.0 m/s (the maximum 
allowed), Montgomery ran 9.78. This record was later discredited because 
of doping. Montgomery did not qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics, finishing 
seventh in the final of the United States Olympic trials. Before the trials, 
however, he was charged with using illegal performance-enhancing drugs, 
by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). While he has not returned 
a positive drug test, according to press reports he testified to the agency 
that he, along with a number of other prominent athletes (including baseball 
star Barry Bonds), obtained steroids and human growth hormone from BALCO, 
a laboratory near San Francisco. The USADA sought a four-year suspension 
on Montgomery, who appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). 
On December 13, 2005, the CAS found Montgomery guilty and imposed a two-year 
ban. On top of the ban, all of Montgomery's results and awards since March 
31, 2001, including his former world record, had also been stripped.[1] 
After the ban was announced, Montgomery announced his retirement. The investigation 
also implicated his former partner Marion Jones, winner of the women's 
100 metres at the Sydney Games. On November 24, 2008, Montgomery admitted 
to taking testosterone and human growth hormone before the Sydney Games 
4 x 100 metres relay, in which he helped claim the gold medal.[2] It remains 
unclear though how the admission will affect team-mates Jon Drummond, Bernard 
Williams, Brian Lewis, Maurice Greene and Kenneth Brokenburr. An IOC spokeswoman 
said the committee would look into the matter as part of its open file 
on the BALCO investigation. In April 2006, Montgomery was indicted and 
arrested on fraud charges for his alleged involvement in a money laundering 
scheme. He is accused of depositing three bogus checks totaling $775,000. 
Montgomery allegedly received $20,000 for his participation. His former 
coach, Steve Riddick, was also a defendant in the case.[3] Riddick served 
a prison term of five years and three months. Marion Jones served a six-month 
prison term for lying to investigators about the check-fraud scam. Montgomery 
pleaded guilty to the charges on April 9, 2007. He was sentenced to 46 
months in prison on May 16, 2008.[4] On May 1, 2008, an indictment was 
unsealed that accused the 33-year-old sprinter of dealing more than 100 grams 
of heroin in the Hampton Roads area over the past year, according to The 
Virginian Pilot, the daily newspaper in Virginia Beach. Montgomery told 
the newspaper he knew nothing of the accusations and that his arrest was 
a "total surprise."[5] In October 2008, Montgomery was found guilty and 
sentenced to five years in prison.[6] Montgomery has four children, including 
one son, Tim Jr. (born June 28, 2003), who was conceived with fellow American 
sprinter Marion Jones. He and Jones are no longer partners. In 2009, Montgomery 
married Jamalee, the mother of another of his children, while in prison.
