Missouri and its 63rd season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
72â€“82 during the season and finished 6th in the National League. In his 
first four major league games, first baseman Joe Cunningham became the 
first Cardinals player to hit at least two home runs. On April 6, 2016, 
Jeremy Hazelbaker matched him for this feat.[4] Outfielder Wally Moon won 
the Rookie of the Year Award this year, batting .304, with 12 home runs
