Saint Joseph's University (also referred to as SJU or St. Joe's) is a private, 
coeducational Roman Catholic Jesuit university located in the Overbrook 
neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, and the Lower 
Merion Township on the historic Pennsylvania Main Line. The University 
was founded in 1851 as Saint Joseph's College by the Society of Jesus. 
Saint Joseph's is the seventh oldest Jesuit university in the United States 
and one of 28 member institutions of the Association of Jesuit Colleges 
and Universities. Saint Joseph's University educates over 9,200 undergraduate, 
graduate, and doctoral students each year through the Erivan K. Haub School 
of Business, the College of Arts and Sciences, the Program of Professional 
& Liberal Studies, and the Haub Degree Completion Program. The University 
offers over 60 undergraduate majors, 53 graduate programs, 28 study-abroad 
programs, 12 special-study options, a co-op program, a joint degree program 
with Thomas Jefferson University, and an Ed.D. in Educational Leadership. 
It has 17 centers and institutes, including the prestigious Kinney Center 
for Autism Education & Support and Pedro Arrupe Center for Business Ethics. 
Saint Joseph's has grown in physical size and scope since 2001 with the 
addition of the Maguire Campus, construction of new campus buildings, and 
the addition of new majors and programs annually. For the 2014 U.S. News 
and World Report rankings, in the Master's Universities (North) category, 
Saint Joseph's was ranked number 11.[4] The Saint Joseph's University athletics 
teams are called the Hawks. The Hawks are a NCAA Division I program that 
compete in the Atlantic-10 Conference and Philadelphia's Big 5. The official 
colors of the University are crimson and grey. The school mascot is the 
famous Hawk, which never stops flapping its wings while in costume. Approximately, 
100 Jesuits live on campus with 18 serving as faculty. The university's 
Jesuit Community lives in the Loyola Center, directly across the street 
from Barbelin Hall. The Loyola Center joins Manresa Hall, which is the 
home of the infirm Jesuits, and features a Carriage House (which serves 
as a "guest house"). Other Jesuit residences include St. Alphonsus House 
(at 5800 Overbrook Avenue) and Faber Hall (39 Berwick Road). A few Jesuits 
also live in residence halls; the university president maintains an apartment 
in the Merion Gardens Apartment building. The university also extensively 
uses its Jesuit identity in its branding. The university began "The Magis" 
campaign in 2013 to highlight this commitment to living greater. The Magis 
is taken from the motto of the society of Jesus "Ad maiorem Dei gloriam", 
meaning for "For the greater glory of God".[5] The university also promotes 
the Jesuit principle of "cura personalis" or "Care for the whole person". 
The university requires undergraduates to complete a rigorous general education 
program that focuses heavily on traditional liberal arts disciplines. Every 
general education class is titled "154", which stands for the year 1540 
AD when the Society of Jesus was accepted by the Pope. On September 27, 
2015, Pope Francis, himself a Jesuit, made a stop at the University during 
his two-day visit to Philadelphia.[6] The Seal of Saint Joseph's University 
signifies many things that show the history and values of the university. 
Many of the symbols are not unique to Saint Joseph's and appear on the 
seals of other Jesuit educational institutions. The wolves are over a kettle 
pot to show the generosity of the Loyola family towards the poor. Tradition 
claims that the Loyola's provided so much food for their soldiers that 
even the wolves had enough to eat. IHM are the letters JES in Greek, which 
stands for Jesus. This symbol regularly represents the Jesuits. The stripes 
signify the 7 sons of the House of Loyola, who died defending their home 
from the Moors. The lily is commonly used to represent Saint Joseph, wherever 
he is present. The seal is the unique graphical representation of Saint 
Joseph's and its uniquely Jesuit identity.[7] Despite a decreasing number 
of Jesuit candidates, Saint Joseph's has managed to keep its president 
as an ordained member of the Society of Jesus for 164 years. On August 
15, 2014, President C. Kevin Gillespie, S.J. announced his resignation 
effective the end of June 2015. A national search for the next president 
commenced during 2014â€“2015 academic year and on April 22, 2015, the Board 
of Trustees announced Dr. Mark C. Reed, of Fairfield University, as the 
first lay president of Saint Joseph's.[8] All St. Joseph University undergraduate 
students complete coursework through the General Education Program (GEP) 
focused in four main areas: signature core, variable, integrative learning, 
and overlay courses. In addition, all students are required to complete 
a first-year seminar. Major coursework includes classes in English composition 
and literature, mathematics, philosophy, theology and religious studies, 
social science, world languages, and history. The courses are intended 
to be aligned with Jesuit ideals of social justice, service learning, ethics, 
and real-world application of theory. The GEP is the result of a university-wide 
curriculum overhaul and implemented in Fall 2010. 98% of tenure-track faculty 
hold the highest possible degrees in their fields. The 2008 graduation 
rate was 90% and the freshman retention rate for the Class of 2017 is 89.8%. 
About 51% of undergraduates are enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences 
while 49% are enrolled in the Haub School of Business.[1] The Carnegie 
Classification of Institutions of Higher Education classified Saint Joseph's 
among "Master's Colleges and Universities (larger programs)". There are 
17 centers and institutes of excellence including the Faith-Justice Institute, 
Institute for Catholic Bioethics, Institute for Jewish-Catholic Relations, 
Kinney Center for Autism Education and Support, Pedro Arrupe Center for 
Business Ethics, and the Richard Johnson Center for Anti-Violence. The 
university maintains membership with chapters of Phi Beta Kappa, Beta Gamma 
Sigma, and Alpha Sigma Nu. Students and faculty routinely receive prestigious 
fellowships and scholarships including Fulbright and Goldwater. The College 
of Arts & Sciences comprises 21 departments, offering a wide array of majors 
and interdisciplinary minors in the humanities, social sciences, education, 
natural science, mathematics, and computer science. The McNulty Scholars 
Program aims to provide women in STEM fields extensive undergraduate research 
and mentorship, awarding full and associate level scholarships each year. 
The Summer Scholars Program awards competitive grants to students every 
summer to engage in research and creative projects under faculty mentorship. 
Graduate degrees in the College of Arts and Sciences include biology, computer 
science, criminal justice, education, gerontological services, health administration, 
health education, nurse anesthesia, psychology, public safety and environmental 
protection, training and organizational development, and writing studies. 
Many of the programs offer post-master's certificates in a variety of areas. 
The College also offers a doctoral degree in education.[9] The Professional 
& Liberal Studies program is Saint Joseph's undergraduate continuing studies 
division. As early as 1852, the administration at Saint Joseph's organized 
educational opportunities for adults. In addition to traditional on-campus 
programs and majors, PLS offers accelerated degree programs in English 
and professional communications, health administration, and leadership. 
PLS students wishing to pursue a degree during the day take advantage of 
the division's bridge program, and professionals in certain areas can take 
part in off-campus programs in professional communications, criminal justice, 
food marketing, and purchasing and acquisitions. The Haub School of Business 
is an international AACSB-accredited institution in business and accounting 
offering programs at the bachelor's, master's and executive master's levels. 
U.S.News & World Report has ranked the school's part-time MBA, risk-management 
and insurance, marketing, management, and finance programs among the top 
in the nation. The Haub School was recently named one of the nation's top 
business schools in the Princeton Review's "The Best 300 Business Schools," 
and the undergraduate program was recently recognized by Bloomberg's Businessweek. 
Established in 1979, the Erivan K. Haub School of Business has a distinguished 
tradition of preparing business leaders, professionals and entrepreneurs 
for successful careers. Today, it is the largest undergraduate Jesuit business 
school in the country with 3,400 students, 75 full-time faculty and more 
than 22,000 alumni. The Haub Degree Completion Program offers more flexibly 
structured programs in the Haub School leading to a bachelor's degree and 
other programs leading to associate degrees or certificates, as well as 
other opportunities for personal or career development Haub School is one 
of only 15 business schools in the country to feature a Wall Street trading 
room. The room provides access to electronic sources of financial and investment 
data, analytical tools, and trading simulations. Students in certain classes 
must trade stocks to prepare themselves for specific careers. Haub was 
awarded The Beta Gamma Sigma 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 Silver Chapter 
Award, and the 2010 Gold Chapter Award. The HSB has been ranked in numerous 
reports and studies done by national companies, magazines, and websites. 
The Honors Program offers an enriched curriculum that broadens cultural 
interests, integrates knowledge, sharpens writing skills and encourages 
student involvement in the learning process. Students may enroll in General 
Honors, which is awarded upon successful completion of eight Honors courses, 
or a combination of six Honors courses and Departmental Honors, which is 
awarded upon successful completion of a two-semester honors level research 
project. Students of an exceptional caliber may apply for the University 
Scholar designation. Those who qualify are freed from four to ten of their 
senior year course requirements in order to complete an independent project 
of unusual breadth, depth and originality.[10] Claver House serves home 
to the Honors Program and provides honor students 24-hour access to the 
building's study spaces and computer labs. U.S. News & World ranks Saint 
Joseph's as eleventh among "Regional Universities (North)"[4] The Princeton 
Review named the university one of the best Northeastern Universities in 
2014.[11] In 2013, Forbes ranked the university as the 107th best nationally, 
96th best private school, and 24th best in the northeast.[12] US News and 
World Reports ranked SJU's Marketing, Accounting, and Insurance undergraduate 
programs as 10th, 21st, and 3rd respectively in the North.[4] In 2014, 
The Haub School of Business was ranked the 89th Best Undergraduate Business 
Program in the country, which represented a 3 spot increase from 2013.[16] 
The Princeton Review also named Saint Joseph's as one of The 295 Best Business 
Schools.[17] The Haub School of Business' part-time master's program 19th 
best program in the country and the best in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania.[4] 
Bloomberg BusinessWeek also ranked the Haub School of Business Part Time 
MBA as 29th Best in the country.[18] In 2010, US News and World Report 
ranked the Haub School of Business' part-time MBA program as the best in 
Southeastern Pennsylvania and one of the top 25 in the nation.[4] The 2011 
US News and World Report ranked SJU as the 6th best Master's University 
in the North.[4] In 2010, SJU's Executive MBA program was ranked 18th in 
the nation.[4] The graduate programs in Finance, Management, Marketing, 
Accounting were ranked 20th, 23rd, 23rd, and 24th in the nation respectively.[4] 
Saint Joseph's University has expressed a commitment to increase its online 
offerings. Undergraduate, graduate, and MBA classes are offered online 
to students. US News and World Reports ranked Saint Joseph's as the 61st 
best online bachelor's program, 57th best graduate business program, and 
the 90th best online graduate education programs.[4] Saint Joseph's University's 
campus, often referred to as Hawk Hill, is located on City Avenue, which 
splits the university between the western edge of Philadelphia and Lower 
Merion Township. A bridge which goes over City Avenue, connects the two 
sides of the campus. Its 103 acres (0.42Â km2) are concentrated from Cardinal 
Avenue to 52nd Street and Overbrook Avenue to City Avenue. The university 
also owns several buildings, which are not on the main campus. With the 
acquisition of the Maguire Campus, 57 of the 114 acres (0.46Â km2) are located 
on the Lower Merion side of City Avenue. In all, there are 92 buildings 
on the university's campus.[19] It is within 15 miles (24Â km) of La Salle 
University, Harcum College, Rosemont College, Philadelphia College of Osteopathic 
Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, Temple University, 
Bryn Mawr College, Haverford College, Philadelphia University, Eastern 
University, Cabrini College and Villanova University. SEPTA regional rail 
train stations on each side of campus provide students with easy access 
to Center City. The main campus is located on the Philadelphia side of 
City Avenue between Cardinal and Overbrook Avenues and 52nd Street, and 
is the original location of the university when it moved to City Avenue 
in 1927. Saint Joseph's most recognizable building is Barbelin Hall, opened 
in 1927. The hall is known for its Gothic architecture, particularly the 
gargoyles that mark what is called the Barbelin Quadrangle (or Barbelin 
Courtyard) and the tall, four-spired bell tower that can be seen from miles 
away. The bell tower that sits atop Barbelin served as the university's 
logo for several years. Barbelin Hall was built by John McShain who would 
later go on to construct many buildings in Washington, D.C. such as The 
Pentagon and The Jefferson Memorial.[20] Main campus contains the majority 
of academic buildings, first-year residence halls, and campus houses. Barbelin 
(College of Arts & Sciences), Mandeville (Haub School of Business), Bellarmine, 
Post, and Science Center comprise the main academic halls. Campus houses 
are a prominent feature of main campus serving as departmental offices 
for fine arts (Boland Hall), communication studies (Bronstein Hall), and 
the President and Provost (Regis Hall), as well as several housing options 
for first-year students and upperclassmen. Green spaces on campus include 
St. Mary's, Claver House, and Wolfington lawns located on the Main Campus, 
in addition to two quadrangles, College Hall Quad and Barbelin Quad. The 
Post Academic Center is the university's main library, the result of a 
renovation of the original Francis A. Drexel Library, and an expansion 
project called the Post Learning Commons, from 2011-2013. Drexel Library 
and Post Learning Commons are connected via a glass atrium and bridge through 
the heart of campus. Unique to the Post Academic Center is the Campbell 
Collection in Food Marketing and Post Academic Center houses approximately 
355,000 volumes, 1,450 print journals, 15,000 full-text electronic journals, 
2,800 e-books, 866,000 microforms, 4,975 audio-visual materials.[21] Campion 
Student Center is the hub for student activities, student life administrative 
offices, and dining facilities. The building was renovated in 2008 and 
now includes the main dining hall; a food court featuring Grille Works, 
Subway, and Hawk Wrap; and the C-Store. The student center also features 
the Doyle Banquet Halls, Forum Theater, and President's Lounge used for 
larger gatherings and lectures on campus. Located just off Campion Student 
Center is Simpson Hall which houses the Student Media Center and The Perch, 
a 24-hour student lounge. In September 2012, the university purchased the 
adjacent Cardinal's Residence on 54th and Cardinal Avenue from the Archdiocese 
of Philadelphia.[22] Beginning with the Fall 2014 semester, the Cardinal's 
Residence was renamed 5800 City Ave and serves as a welcome center for 
prospective families and offices for all enrollment management operations. 
On August 8, 2008, Saint Joseph's completed the acquisition of the adjacent 
Episcopal Academy after purchasing the property in 2005. The new 38 acres 
(150,000 m2) was named the Maguire Campus for the lead donor, a Saint Joseph's 
alumnus, James Maguire. The Maguire Campus is located directly across from 
the Main Campus on the Lower Merion side of City Avenue. The Maguire Campus 
features three main academic buildings: Merion Hall, Connelly Hall, and 
Toland Hall. Merion Hall is the largest of the academic building on the 
Maguire Campus and includes the University Gallery. The Cardinal John Foley 
Center, a multi-use space, hosts lectures, concerts, and social gatherings, 
in addition to large-scale admission events. The Kinney Center for Autism 
Education and Support established in 2009 which was made possible with 
donations totaling over $8 million is located in Connelly Hall. Duperreault, 
Quinn, and Windrim Halls are campus houses serving as administrative space 
for University Advancement. Athletic facilities include the Michael A. 
O'Pake, Esq. '61 Recreation Center, Ellen Ryan Field (field hockey), John 
Smithson Field (baseball), Curran Lawn, and a softball field. Along with 
all of the buildings and fields, the Maguire Campus adds over 300 parking 
spaces for faculty and students, and a number of acres will be turned into 
green space. There are over 600 different species of trees on the Maguire 
Campus. The Overbrook Campus is located about a mile from and Main Campusâ€”near 
Overbrook Train Station. Saint Joseph's University owns buildings on both 
sides of City Avenue. Currently, the campus holds 6 dorms, reserved exclusively 
for sophomores, juniors, and seniors. These dorms are: Ashwood Apartments, 
Wynnewood Hall, Merion Gardens Apartments, Pennbrook Apartments, Morris 
Quad Townhouses, Moore Hall. It also houses the Alumni House.[19] Although 
it is located about a mile from the main campus, Saint Joseph's University 
runs shuttles every 30 minutes (and 15 minutes during peak hours) to accommodate 
students. Approximately 80% of students at Saint Joseph's live on campus, 
and on-campus residency is required for freshmen and sophomores. Housing 
options include residence halls, apartments, townhouses, and campus houses. 
First-year students can choose from two traditional residence halls (McShain 
Hall and Villiger Hall), two suite-style residence halls (Sourin Residence 
Center and LaFarge Residence Center) or two campus houses (Tara and Quirk 
Halls). Villiger Hall, the university's newest residence, opened in August 
2012. All first-year housing options are located on main campus. Sophomores, 
juniors, and seniors can choose to live in several campus houses, including 
Hogan, Jordan, St. Albert's, Sullivan, St. Mary's, and Xavier Halls. Apartment-style 
living is available on campus at Pennbrook, Lancaster Court (Weymouth and 
Hastings), Ashwood, Rashford, Lannon, and Wynnewood. There are two exclusive 
Junior-Senior living communities in the Merion Gardens Apartments and the 
Morris Quad Townhouses, and six Residential-Learning Communities focused 
on Science (freshmen), Emerging Leaders (freshmen), Business (freshmen), 
Romero (upperclassmen), Arts (upperclassmen), Business (upperclassmen). 
During a presentation to the faculty in April 2013, President Kevin Gillespie, 
S.J., announced that, partially thanks to the popular Magis campaign, the 
university is beginning to expand, as it has a freshman class of 1,300 
students enrolled for the Fall 2013. By 2017, it hopes to enroll 6,000 
undergraduate students.[23] The university is heading into the final leg 
of its strategic plan, Plan 2020: Gateway to the Future, focused on increased 
academic distinction, facility enhancements, and endowment growth. The 
university has raised over $12.1 million and created 40 new scholarships 
under President Gillespie's Magis Scholarship Initiative.[24] Larger campus 
enhancement projects include a new dining hall and black box theatre on 
Maguire Campus, and an expansion of Mandeville Hall currently on hold due 
to funding concerns.[25] Saint Joseph's 8,860 students come from all over 
the United States with most coming from the Northeast, including Pennsylvania.[26] 
4,670 of these students are traditional undergraduates, while the university's 
graduate and professional student population is numbered at 3,580.[26] 
The student body is 51.5% female and 48.5% male.[26] The retention rate 
for Saint Joseph's is high, with about 88.3% of students returning for 
their sophomore year.[26] 74% of students graduate within 4 years.[26] 
This is due to, in part, the student-faculty ratio, which is 14:1. Additionally 
39.7% of classes have less than 20 students.[26] Saint Joseph's University 
is considered selective through its admission rate. The overall acceptance 
rate is 58.3% with the early action acceptance rate of 68.4%.[26] The average 
freshman retention rate is 88.3%.[26] 94% of the Class of 2013 were either 
employed, pursuing graduate studies, or involved in full-time volunteer 
programs within six months of graduation.[31] The average starting salary 
was $48,400 for the Class of 2013, while the average graduate student from 
the Class of 2013 received $13,600 in scholarships.[31] Beginning with 
the Class of 2014 high school graduates, Saint Joseph's University is test 
optional. This means that it does not require applicants to submit SAT 
or ACT test scores, although applicants may choose to submit these scores. 
The University's program is a 4-year test program, which will be reaccessed 
in 2017.[32] In Summer 2014, John Aller, associate provost for enrollment 
management at Saint Joseph's, discussed the progress of the SAT optional 
program. For the class of 2018, applications increased by 8 percent to 
8,500. About 18 percent of those applicants chose not to submit test scores. 
Of the incoming Fall 2014 freshman class of 1,350, one in five was admitted 
without having submitted test scores. Haller also noted that the average 
GPA for the class is identical to last year's class.[33] The school offers 
over a 100 student organizations.[1] Saint Joseph's has 20 NCAA Division 
1 Athletic programs, 30 clubs and intramural sports, fitness programs, 
and competes in the Philadelphia City 6 Extramural Classics.[34] Organizations 
include national fraternities and national sororities, a radio station, 
and two newspapers, The Hawk and the HawkEye, the Student Union Board, 
the Student Senate, and the Student Concert Committee among many others.[34] 
The Villiger Debating Society, the school's 150-year-old, nationally recognized 
speech and debate team, has finished in the top twenty in the nation for 
the past ten years. The organization also hosts an annual speech tournament 
every November on the Saint Joseph's University campus for High School 
students from across the United States. Additionally, The Villiger Debating 
Society offers a scholarship opportunity for incoming students focusing 
on leadership, competition, and service. Academic organizations including 
the Deans Leadership Program, academic fraternities, and honor societies, 
are present alongside interest groups and those that pertain to nationality 
and diversity such as the Caribbean Club and the Black Student Union. Women's 
groups such as the Women's Leadership Initiative and Hawk Women are also 
present on campus among many others. Given its commitment to serve others, 
over 500 students participate in weekly service through the school.[34] 
The University also promotes the alternative Spring Break program Appalachian 
Experience, where students perform service in Appalachian communities. 
Students are also afforded the opportunities to participate in Weekly Service, 
a program that allows the students to choose their desired service site, 
ranging from working with children to soup kitchens, and serve once a week 
throughout the semester.[34] While Appalachia and Weekly Service are popular, 
there are many more avenues for service on and off campus. Any student 
may start any club provided that they reach the required minimum number 
of students, have a faculty advisor, and file all appropriate paperwork 
with Student Leadership and Activities.[34] Saint Joseph's University publishes 
an official alumni magazine, "SJU Magazine," three times a year. In addition, 
standalone magazines are published once a year for the Haub School of Business 
(called "Haub School Review") and College of Arts and Sciences (called 
"Intellect"). The Hawk, the university's student newspaper, is published 
weekly during the fall and spring semester. The Crimson and Gray Literary 
Magazine showcases the best of student fiction, poetry, and artwork in 
an annual publication; students and faculty may download the magazine for 
free (available from the organization's website) or pick one up from select 
locations around campus.[35] The Drexel Library has its own newsletter 
called Library Lines.[36] The Saint Joseph's University Press prints books 
and articles written by faculty and other authors.[37] Radio 1851 is Saint 
Joseph's University's student-run radio station that plays a variety of 
genres, including indie rock, rap/hip-hop, country, and electric dance 
music. The station began in 1922 as WSJR,[38] the first college radio station 
to broadcast on AM, and then moved to FM in the 80s. 1851 Entertainment 
is a student-run, event management organization run by Saint Joseph's Entertainment 
Marketing majors and Music Industry minors. The club presents various events 
on and off campus including Open Mics at The Perch, the school's student 
lounge and other showcases and charity events such as Rock To Remember. 
Saint Joseph's University recognizes eight social Greek organizations and 
two co-educational, professional Greek organizations. Approximately 21% 
of undergraduates are affiliated with a social fraternity or sorority.[39] 
No Greek housing is provided by the university. No sorority has ever been 
closed or otherwise dormant. Saint Joseph's University is home of the Hawks, 
the University's athletic program. The Saint Joseph's school colors are 
crimson and gray. It fields teams in 20 varsity sports in Division I of 
the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The Hawks are part of the 
Atlantic 10 Conference. Since the Atlantic 10 does not support men's lacrosse, 
the Hawks play in the Northeast Conference for that sport only. Along with 
the Atlantic 10, Saint Joseph's is a member of the Philadelphia Big 5 which 
intensifies local rivalries within Philadelphia City Schools. Its effect 
on Saint Joseph's causes intense games with Temple University, Villanova 
University, the University of Pennsylvania, and inter-conference rival 
LaSalle University. Saint Joseph's is also a member of the City 6. Similar 
to the Big 5, the City 6 comprises the entire Philadelphia Big 5 plus Drexel 
University, which did not participate in NCAA Division 1 Athletics until 
1973. In addition to official team rivalries, the local colleges also compete 
in various extramural sporting events to crown a City 6 Champion. One of 
the most famous mascots in college sports, the Saint Joseph's Hawk has 
been flapping its wings for 57 years. Jim Brennan originated the idea for 
a hawk as mascot during the 1954-55 season. Brennan, an ex-Marine and SJU 
cheerleader, at first wanted to secure an actual hawk, but later switched 
to the costume idea. The student government raised the 120 dollars needed 
to buy the initial costume, which Brennan donned for three years. He made 
his debut as the Hawk on January 4, 1956, a 69-56 win over La Salle at 
the Palestra."[40] The Hawk is best known for staying in constant motion 
by flapping its wings throughout every basketball game and representing 
the Saint Joseph's motto, "The Hawk Will Never Die". In addition to the 
constant flapping, the Hawk is also recognized by its "flying" in figure 
eights around the court during timeouts.[40] While Saint Joseph's fields 
20 NCAA sports, the University's most popular sport is the Men's basketball 
team. Saint Joseph's has a rich basketball tradition. The Saint Joseph's 
basketball teams play most of their home games at Hagan Arena on the school's 
campus, while some games are played at the Palestra, which is located at 
the campus of the University of Pennsylvania. Saint Joseph's major rival 
is Villanova University. The rivalry is known as the Holy War, although 
starting in 2013 both schools have requested the media refrain from using 
the term.[41] The school maintains other intense rivalries with the other 
Philadelphia Universities. Fans of the Hawks often chant "The Hawk Will 
Never Die!". Since the school's undefeated regular season, this chant has 
gained familiarity with the team's opponents. In 2003, Sports Illustrated 
listed that cheer among The 100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate 
(Whatever the Cost), calling it "the most defiant cheer in college sports."[42] 
The university also has a 240 by 120 four-court multi-purpose area for 
basketball, tennis, and volleyball, an indoor four-lane 200-yard (180Â m) 
jogging track, an 8-lane 25-meter indoor pool with a 300-seat observation 
area, four racquetball courts, locker rooms and saunas, a large fitness 
center, and nine outdoor tennis courts. The Maguire Campus includes another 
two gyms, a pool, and a weight room, this has been renamed to the O'Pake 
Athletic Center. There are over 60,000 living alumni of Saint Joseph's 
who live in all 50 states and 59 countries.[44] Charles J. Dunlap, Jr.
