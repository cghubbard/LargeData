Joseph J. "Sport" Sullivan (November 2, 1870 â€“ April 6, 1949) was an American 
bookmaker and gambler from Boston, Massachusetts who helped to initiate 
the 1919 Black Sox Scandal. Sullivan was a known gambler in the Boston 
area who reportedly bet heavily on the 1903 World Series, and in fact tried 
to bribe Boston pitcher Cy Young.[1] He was arrested for gambling on baseball 
in 1907.[2] In 1919, Sullivan was living in the Boston suburb of Sharon, 
Massachusetts. In September 1919, Sullivan met with Chicago White Sox' 
first baseman Charles Arnold 'Chick' Gandil at Boston's Hotel Buckminster 
and conspired with Gandil to perpetrate a fix of the 1919 World Series.[3] 
It has been disputed which of the two men initiated the meeting. Gandil 
had known Sullivan since 1912, and he later maintained that Sullivan approached 
him concerning the plot to throw the series.[4] At Sullivan's suggestion, 
Gandil recruited several teammates to intentionally lose the games. Sullivan 
met with noted organized crime boss Arnold Rothstein, who agreed to bankroll 
the fix for $80,000. Rothstein provided an initial $40,000 for Sullivan 
to distribute to the involved players; however Sullivan kept $30,000 for 
his own wagering and gave only $10,000 to Gandil.[5] After the scheme had 
been exposed, Sullivan did not testify in front of the Chicago grand jury 
hearing in October 1920, because William J. Fallon, the lawyer of Arnold 
Rothstein, persuaded Sullivan not to do so.[6] If Sullivan did testify, 
it would probably expose the fact that Rothstein had been the one providing 
the money for the Black Sox players to fix the Series. Still, he was later 
indicted on nine counts of conspiracy to defraud. Sullivan reportedly was 
paid by Rothstein to flee to Mexico so that he would not go to Chicago 
to testify in front of the Grand Jury.[5] Sullivan was never arrested nor 
appeared at the trial, which started in June 27, 1921.[7] The trial ended 
in an acquittal for all the defendants.[8] Sullivan appeared at Yankee 
Stadium during the 1926 World Series. He was recognized by Ban Johnson, 
who had police escort Sullivan out of the stadium.[9] Sullivan died in 
Sharon, Massachusetts in 1949.[10] Sullivan's life was dramatized in Brendan 
Boyd's 1991 historical fiction Blue Ruin: A Novel of the 1919 World Series 
which retells the Black Sox Scandal through Sullivan's narration.[11][12] 
Sullivan was portrayed by Kevin Tighe in the 1988 film Eight Men Out. He 
was also mentioned (despite not appearing as a character) in Boardwalk
