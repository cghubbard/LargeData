In baseball, a strikeout occurs when the batter receives three strikes 
during his time at bat. Strikeouts are associated with dominance on the 
part of the pitcher and failure on the part of the batter. Nolan Ryan has 
the most career strikeouts in Major League Baseball. During a record 27-year 
career, he struck out 5,714 batters. A player is considered "inactive" 
if he has not played baseball for one year or has announced his retirement.
