Richard Allen "Dick" Dietz (September 18, 1941 â€“ June 28, 2005) was an 
American professional baseball player.[1] He played as a catcher in Major 
League Baseball for the San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Dodgers, and 
Atlanta Braves from 1966 to 1973.[1] Born in Crawfordsville, Indiana, Dietz 
was signed by the San Francisco Giants as an amateur free agent before 
the start of the 1960 season.[1] He showed some promise as a hitter, posting 
a .354 batting average with 35 home runs and 101 runs batted in while playing 
for the El Paso Sun Kings in the Texas League in 1963.[2] Dietz made his 
major league debut with the Giants on June 18, 1966 at the age of 24.[1] 
Nicknamed Mule, he played as the Giants backup catcher behind Tom Haller 
in 1967.[1][3] In September, Dietz was named to the 1967 Topps All-Star 
Rookie Team.[4] In February 1968, the Giants were in need of good infielders, 
and with four young catching prospects in their system, including Dietz, 
club president Chub Feeney decided to trade Haller along with a player 
to be named later, to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Ron Hunt and Nate Oliver.[5] 
Dietz shared catching duties with Jack Hiatt and Bob Barton in 1968, producing 
a .272 batting average with 6 home runs and 38 runs batted in.[1] Dietz 
is remembered for his role in a controversial umpiring decision during 
the 1968 season.[6] The Giants were facing Dodgers' pitcher Don Drysdale, 
who was in the midst of a scoreless inning streak that would eventually 
reach a record-setting 58 and two-thirds innings.[7] The Giants had the 
bases loaded with no outs and Dietz at bat.[7] Dietz was hit by a pitch, 
apparently ending Drysdale's scoreless innings streak.[7] However, home 
plate umpire Harry Wendelstedt, citing a rarely enforced rule, refused 
to allow Dietz to take first base, claiming that Dietz did not attempt 
to avoid being struck by the ball.[7] Drysdale then retired Dietz and the 
next two batters, keeping his scoreless streak alive.[7] Dietz was the 
Giants catcher on September 17, 1968, when Gaylord Perry pitched a no-hitter 
against the St. Louis Cardinals.[8] In 1969, Dietz continued to share the 
catching duties with Hiatt and Barton.[1] When the other two players were 
traded before the start of the 1970 season, Dietz became the Giants' regular 
starting catcher.[3] In his first season as a full-time player in 1970, 
Dietz hit for a .337 batting average with 18 home runs and 77 runs batted 
in at mid-season.[9] Although he wasn't listed on the All-Star ballot and 
received few write-in votes, the manager for the National League All-Star 
team, Gil Hodges, named Dietz as a reserve player for the National League 
team.[10] In the 1970 All-Star Game, Dietz replaced Johnny Bench in the 
top of the seventh inning and led off the bottom of the ninth inning with 
a home run off Catfish Hunter that helped spark a rally that tied the game.[11] 
The National League went on to win the game in the twelfth inning with 
a climactic collision at home plate between Pete Rose and Ray Fosse (It 
was Dietz who was in the on deck circle, congratulating Rose immediately 
after the collision).[11] He ended the 1970 season with career-highs in 
batting average (.300), home runs (22), runs batted in (107), walks (109) 
and in on-base percentage (.426). His 1970 season remains historic as of 
2009, as he is the only catcher to tally 100 walks, 100 RBI and hit .300 
in the same Major League Baseball season.[citation needed] Dietz was an 
integral member of the 1971 Giants team that clinched the National League 
Western Division title.[6] The Giants had a nine-game lead over the Los 
Angeles Dodgers on August 1, but held on during a pennant race to win the 
division by a narrow one-game margin.[12] Dietz caught every game during 
the tense final stages of the season, and provided offensive support with 
19 home runs and 72 runs batted in.[1][6] In the only post-season appearance 
of his career, Dietz had only one hit in 15 at-bats, as the Giants lost 
to the eventual world champion Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1971 National 
League Championship Series.[13] In 1972, Dietz fell from favor with the 
Giants' management for his role as player representative during the 1972 
Major League Baseball strike that delayed the start of the season. Other 
reports stated that the Giants gave up on Dietz because of his defensive 
liabilities, having led National League catchers in passed balls in 1970 
and 1971.[14] Soon after the strike was settled, he was claimed off waivers 
by the Los Angeles Dodgers.[14] Unfortunately, Dietz broke his wrist on 
July 30 and missed much of the 1972 season. In 1973, Dietz had an excellent 
season as a reserve first baseman and catcher for the Braves, batting .295 
with a .474 on-base percentage.[1] However, the Braves released him after 
the season, and after no team signed him for 1974, Dietz' career was over 
at the age of 32.[1][15] In an eight-year major league career, Dietz played 
in 646 games, accumulating 478 hits in 1,829 at bats for a .261 career 
batting average along with 66 home runs, 301 runs batted in and an on-base 
percentage of .390.[1] Although he was better known for his power hitting, 
he was a capable defensive catcher, ending his career with a .981 fielding 
percentage.[1] After his retirement as a player, Dietz served as a minor 
league coach and manager. He managed the San Jose Giants in 1993 and 1994, 
the Sioux Falls Canaries in 1995 and the Sonoma County Crushers from 1996 
to 1999.[16] Dietz died at age 63 of a heart attack in Clayton, Georgia
