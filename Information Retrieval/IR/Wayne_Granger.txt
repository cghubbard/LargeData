Wayne Allan Granger (born March 15, 1944) is a former Major League Baseball 
right-handed relief pitcher who played for the St. Louis Cardinals (1968, 
1973), Cincinnati Reds (1969–1971), Minnesota Twins (1972), New York Yankees 
(1973), Chicago White Sox (1974), Houston Astros (1975) and Montreal Expos 
(1976). The 6–4, 165-pound Granger was one of baseball's most effective 
and durable relief pitchers during the early years of Cincinnati's famed 
Big Red Machine.[1] Granger graduated from Huntington High School in Huntington, 
Massachusetts. He attended Springfield College (Massachusetts) where he 
was a pitcher on the 1965 baseball team.[2] Before his professional career 
began, Granger played two seasons in the province of Quebec in the Saguenay 
senior league—in 1963 for the Jonquiere Braves and in 1964 for Port-Alfred 
in 1964.[3] Granger was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals as an amateur 
free agent in 1965. He made his big-league debut at age 24 on June 5, 1968 
in a 3–1 Cardinals win over the Houston Astros at the Astrodome, also earning 
his first save with one perfect inning in relief of starter Larry Jaster. 
The first-ever batter he faced was Bob Aspromonte, whom he struck out.[4] 
The rookie sinkerballer went 4–2 with a 2.25 ERA in 34 games that season. 
However, on October 11, 1968, the Cardinals traded Bobby Tolan and Granger 
to the Cincinnati Reds for Vada Pinson. With the Reds in 1969 Granger posted 
a 9–6 record and 2.79 ERA with 27 saves in a then-National League record 
90 appearances, and he won the first of two straight Fireman of the Year 
awards. The following season in 1970 he set a National League record with 
35 saves (since broken) while going 6–5 with a 2.66 ERA in 67 games. That 
season, he ranked eighth in the National League Cy Young Award voting. 
In June of that year, he threw the final pitch and also earned the last 
victory at the Reds' venerable home Crosley Field before the team moved 
to Riverfront Stadium.[5] During Game 3 of the 1970 World Series against 
the Baltimore Orioles, Granger surrendered a grand slam to opposing pitcher 
Dave McNally. It is the only time in World Series history that a pitcher 
has hit a grand slam. The Reds lost the best-of-seven series in five games, 
and Granger never again pitched in the postseason. In 1971 he again led 
the league in games pitched with 70, posting a 7–6 record with a 3.33 ERA 
and 11 saves. After the season the Reds traded him to the Minnesota Twins. 
After one year with the Twins, beginning in 1973 Granger pitched for five 
teams in four seasons.[1] Arm injuries cut short his career in 1976. He 
earned induction into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1982, only the 
second Reds' relief pitcher to be so honored.[5] He has since periodically 
returned to Cincinnati for Reds reunions including the annual RedsFest
