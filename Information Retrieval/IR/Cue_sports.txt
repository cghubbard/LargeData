Cue sports (sometimes written cuesports), also known as billiard sports,[1][2] 
are a wide variety of games of skill generally played with a cue stick 
which is used to strike billiard balls, moving them around a cloth-covered 
billiards table bounded by rubber cushions. Historically, the umbrella 
term was billiards. While that familiar name is still employed by some 
as a generic label for all such games, the word's usage has splintered 
into more exclusive competing meanings in various parts of the world. For 
example, in British and Australian English, "billiards" usually refers 
exclusively to the game of English billiards, while in American and Canadian 
English it is sometimes used to refer to a particular game or class of 
games, or to all cue games in general, depending upon dialect and context. 
There are three major subdivisions of games within cue sports: There are 
other variants that make use of obstacles and targets, and table-top games 
played with disks instead of balls. Billiards has a long and rich history 
stretching from its inception in the 15th century, to the wrapping of the 
body of Mary, Queen of Scots, in her billiard table cover in 1586, through 
its many mentions in the works of Shakespeare, including the famous line 
"let's to billiards" in Antony and Cleopatra (1606–07), and through the 
many famous enthusiasts of the sport such as: Mozart, Louis XIV of France, 
Marie Antoinette, Immanuel Kant, Napoleon, Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, 
George Washington, French president Jules Grévy, Charles Dickens, George 
Armstrong Custer, Theodore Roosevelt, Lewis Carroll, W.C. Fields, Babe 
Ruth, Bob Hope, and Jackie Gleason. All cue sports are generally regarded 
to have evolved into indoor games from outdoor stick-and-ball lawn games 
(retroactively termed ground billiards),[4] and as such to be related to 
the historical games jeu de mail and palle-malle, and modern trucco, croquet 
and golf, and more distantly to the stickless bocce and bowls. The word 
"billiard" may have evolved from the French word billart or billette, meaning 
"stick", in reference to the mace, an implement similar to a golf club, 
which was the forerunner to the modern cue; the term's origin may have 
also been from French bille, meaning "ball".[5] The modern term "cue sports" 
can be used to encompass the ancestral mace games, and even the modern 
cueless variants, such as finger billiards, for historical reasons. "Cue" 
itself came from queue, the French word for a tail. This refers to the 
early practice of using the tail of the mace to strike the ball when it 
lay against a rail cushion.[5] A recognizable form of billiards was played 
outdoors in the 1340s, and was reminiscent of croquet. King Louis XI of 
France (1461–1483) had the first known indoor billiard table.[5] Louis 
XIV further refined and popularized the game, and it swiftly spread among 
the French nobility.[5] While the game had long been played on the ground, 
this version appears to have died out in the 17th century, in favor of 
croquet, golf and bowling games, while table billiards had grown in popularity 
as an indoor activity.[5] Mary, Queen of Scots, claimed that her "table 
de billiard" had been taken away by those who eventually became her executioners 
(and who covered her body with the table's cloth).[5] In 1588, the Duke 
of Norfolk, owned a "billyard bord coered with a greene cloth... three 
billyard sticks and 11 balls of yvery".[5] Billiards grew to the extent 
that by 1727, it was being played in almost every Paris café.[5] In England, 
the game was developing into a very popular activity for members of the 
gentry.[5] By 1670, the thin butt end of the mace began to be used not 
only for shots under the cushion (which itself was originally only there 
as a preventative method to stop balls from rolling off), but players increasingly 
preferred it for other shots as well. The cue as it is known today was 
finally developed by about 1800.[5] Initially, the mace was used to push 
the balls, rather than strike them. The newly developed striking cue provided 
a new challenge. Cushions began to be stuffed with substances to allow 
the balls to rebound, in order to enhance the appeal of the game. After 
a transitional period where only the better players would use cues, the 
cue came to be the first choice of equipment.[5] The demand for tables 
and other equipment was initially met in Europe by John Thurston and other 
furniture makers of the era. The early balls were made from wood and clay, 
but the rich preferred to use ivory.[5] Early billiard games involved various 
pieces of additional equipment, including the "arch" (related to the croquet 
hoop), "port" (a different hoop) and "king" (a pin or skittle near the 
arch) in the 1770s, but other game variants, relying on the cushions (and 
eventually on pockets cut into them), were being formed that would go on 
to play fundamental roles in the development of modern billiards.[5] The 
early croquet-like games eventually led to the development of the carom 
or carambole billiards category – what most non-Commonwealth and non-US 
speakers mean by the word "billiards". These games, which once completely 
dominated the cue sports world but have declined markedly in many areas 
over the last few generations, are games played with three or sometimes 
four balls, on a table without holes (and without obstructions or targets 
in most cases), in which the goal is generally to strike one object ball 
with a cue ball, then have the cue ball rebound off of one or more of the 
cushions and strike a second object ball. Variations include three-cushion, 
straight rail and the balkline variants, cushion caroms, five-pins, and 
four-ball, among others. Over time, a type of obstacle returned, originally 
as a hazard and later as a target, in the form of pockets, or holes partly 
cut into the table bed and partly into the cushions, leading to the rise 
of pocket billiards, including "pool" games such as eight-ball, nine-ball, 
straight pool and one-pocket; Russian pyramid; snooker; English billiards 
and others. In the United States pool and billiards had died out for a 
bit, but between 1878 and 1956 pool and billiards became very popular. 
Players in annual championships began to receive their own cigarette cards. 
This was mainly due to the fact that it was a popular pastime for troops 
to take their minds off from battle. However, by the end of World War II 
pool and billiards began to die down once again. It was not until 1961 
when the film "The Hustler" came out that sparked a new interest in the 
game. Now the game is generally a well-known game and has many players 
of all different skill levels.[6] There are few more cheerful sights, when 
the evenings are long, and the weather dull, than a handsome, well-lighted 
billiard room, with the smooth, green surface of the billiard table; the 
ivory balls flying noiselessly here and there, or clicking musically together.[7] 
The games with regulated international professional competition, if not 
others, have been referred to as "sports" or "sporting" events, not simply 
"games", since 1893 at the latest.[8] Quite a variety of particular games 
(i.e., sets of rules and equipment) are the subject of present-day competition, 
including many of those already mentioned, with competition being especially 
broad in nine-ball, snooker, three-cushion and eight-ball. Snooker, though 
technically a pocket billiards variant and closely related in its equipment 
and origin to the game of English billiards, is a professional sport organized 
at the international level, and its rules bear little resemblance to those 
of modern pool, pyramid and other such games. A "Billiards" category encompassing 
pool, snooker and carom was featured in the 2005 World Games, held in Duisburg, 
Germany, and the 2006 Asian Games also saw the introduction of a "Cue sports" 
category. Billiard balls vary from game to game, in size, design and quantity. 
Russian pyramid and kaisa have a size of 68 mm ( 2 11⁄16 in). In Russian 
pyramid there are sixteen balls, as in pool, but fifteen are white and 
numbered, and the cue ball is usually red.[9] In Kaisa, five balls are 
used: the yellow object ball (called the kaisa in Finnish), two red object 
balls, and the two white cue balls (usually differentiated by one cue ball 
having a dot or other marking on it and each of which serves as an object 
ball for the opponent). Carom billiards balls are larger than pool balls, 
having a diameter of 61.5 mm ( 2 7⁄16 in), and come as a set of two cue 
balls (one colored or marked) and an object ball (or two object balls in 
the case of the game four-ball). American-style pool balls are 57 mm ( 
2 1⁄4 in), are used in many pool games found throughout the world, come 
in sets of two suits of object balls, seven solids and seven stripes, an 
8 ball and a cue ball; the balls are racked differently for different games 
(some of which do not use the entire ball set). Blackball (English-style 
eight-ball) sets are similar, but have unmarked groups of red (or blue) 
and yellow balls instead of solids and stripes, and at 56 mm ( 2 3⁄16 in) 
are smaller than the American-style; they are used principally in Britain, 
Ireland, and some Commonwealth countries, though not exclusively, since 
they are unsuited for playing nine-ball. Snooker balls are smaller than 
American-style pool balls with a diameter of 52.5 mm ( 2 1⁄15 in), and 
come in sets of 22 (15 reds, 6 "colours", and a cue ball). English billiard 
balls are the same size as snooker balls and come in sets of three balls 
(two cue balls and a red, an object ball). Other games, such as bumper 
pool, have custom ball sets. Billiard balls have been made from many different 
materials since the start of the game, including clay, bakelite, celluloid, 
crystallite, ivory, plastic, steel and wood. The dominant material from 
1627 until the early 20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute 
for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic 
motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred 
on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 
for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid, invented 
by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile, sometimes 
exploding during manufacture and was highly flammable.[10][11] There are 
many sizes and styles of pool and billiard tables. Generally, tables are 
rectangles twice as long as they are wide. Most pool tables are known as 
7-, 8-, or 9-footers, referring to the length of the table's long side. 
Full-size snooker and English billiard tables are 12 feet (3.7 m) long 
on the longest side. Pool halls tend to have 9-foot (2.7 m) tables and 
cater to the serious pool player. Pubs will typically use 7-foot (2.1 m) 
tables which are often coin-operated. Formerly, 10-foot (3 m) tables were 
common, but such tables are now considered antique collectors items; a 
few, usually from the late 19th century, can be found in pool halls from 
time to time. Ten-foot tables remain the standard size for carom billiard 
games. The slates on modern carom tables are usually heated to stave off 
moisture and provide a consistent playing surface. The length of the pool 
table will typically be a function of space, with many homeowners purchasing 
an 8-foot (2.4 m) table as a compromise. Full-size pool tables are 4.5 
by 9 ft (2.7 m) (interior dimensions). High-quality tables have a bed made 
of thick slate, in three pieces to prevent warping and changes due to temperature 
and humidity. Smaller bar tables are most commonly made with a single piece 
of slate. Pocket billiards tables of all types normally have six pockets, 
three on each side (four corner pockets, and two side or middle pockets). 
All types of tables are covered with billiard cloth (often called "felt", 
but actually a woven wool or wool/nylon blend called baize). Cloth has 
been used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century. Bar or tavern 
tables, which get a lot of play, use "slower", more durable cloth. The 
cloth used in upscale pool (and snooker) halls and home billiard rooms 
is "faster" (i.e., provides less friction, allowing the balls to roll farther 
across the table bed), and competition-quality pool cloth is made from 
100% worsted wool. Snooker cloth traditionally has a nap (consistent fiber 
directionality) and balls behave differently when rolling against versus 
along with the nap. The cloth of the billiard table has traditionally been 
green, reflecting its origin (originally the grass of ancestral lawn games), 
and has been so colored since the 16th century, but it is also produced 
in other colors such as red and blue.[12] The cloth was earlier said to 
be the most important part of the game, most likely because of the reflection 
of the game's origin. The players were stubborn in the fact that the cloth 
should not be ripped. They even made women continue to use maces after 
cues were invented, for fear that they would rip the cloth with the sharper 
cues. A rack is the name given to a frame (usually wood, plastic or aluminium) 
used to organize billiard balls at the beginning of a game. This is traditionally 
triangular in shape, but varies with the type of billiards played. There 
are two main types of racks; the more common triangular shape which is 
used for eight-ball and straight pool and the diamond-shaped rack used 
for nine-ball. There are several other types of less common rack types 
that are also used, based on a "template" to hold the billiard balls tightly 
together. Most commonly it is a thin plastic sheet with diamond-shaped 
cut-outs that hold the balls that is placed on the table with the balls 
set on top of the rack. The rack is used to set up the "break" and removed 
before the "break shot" occurs. Billiards games are mostly played with 
a stick known as a cue. A cue is usually either a one piece tapered stick 
or a two piece stick divided in the middle by a joint of metal or phenolic 
resin. High quality cues are generally two pieces and are made of a hardwood, 
generally maple for billiards and ash for snooker. The butt end of the 
cue is of larger circumference and is intended to be gripped by a player's 
hand. The shaft of the cue is of smaller circumference, usually tapering 
to an 0.4 to 0.55 inches (10 to 14 mm) terminus called a ferrule (usually 
made of fiberglass or brass in better cues), where a rounded leather tip 
is affixed, flush with the ferrule, to make final contact with balls. The 
tip, in conjunction with chalk, can be used to impart spin to the cue ball 
when it is not hit in its center. Cheap cues are generally made of pine, 
low-grade maple (and formerly often of ramin, which is now endangered), 
or other low-quality wood, with inferior plastic ferrules. A quality cue 
can be expensive and may be made of exotic woods and other expensive materials 
which are artfully inlaid in decorative patterns. Many modern cues are 
also made, like golf clubs, with high-tech materials such as woven graphite. 
Skilled players may use more than one cue during a game, including a separate 
generally lighter cue for the opening break shot (because of cue speed 
gained from a lighter stick) and another, shorter cue with a special tip 
for jump shots. The mechanical bridge, sometimes called a "rake", "bridge 
stick" or simply "bridge", and in the UK a "rest", is used to extend a 
player's reach on a shot where the cue ball is too far away for normal 
hand bridging. It consists of a stick with a grooved metal or plastic head 
which the cue slides on. Many amateurs refuse to use the mechanical bridge 
based on the perception that to do so is unmanly.[citation needed] However, 
many aficionados and most professionals employ the bridge whenever the 
intended shot so requires. Some players, especially current or former snooker 
players, use a screw-on cue butt extension instead of or in addition to 
the mechanical bridge. Bridge head design is varied, and not all designs 
(especially those with cue shaft-enclosing rings, or wheels on the bottom 
of the head), are broadly tournament-approved. In Italy a longer, thicker 
cue is typically available for this kind of tricky shot. For snooker they 
are normally available in three forms, their use depending on how the player 
is hampered; the standard rest is a simple cross, the 'spider' has a raised 
arch around 12 cm with three grooves to rest the cue in and for the most 
awkward of shots, the 'giraffe' (or 'swan' in England) which has a raised 
arch much like the 'spider' but with a slender arm reaching out around 
15 cm with the groove. Chalk is applied to the tip of the cue stick, ideally 
before every shot, to increase the tip's friction coefficient so that when 
it impacts the cue ball on a non-center hit, no miscue (unintentional slippage 
between the cue tip and the struck ball) occurs. Cue tip chalk is not actually 
the substance typically referred to as "chalk" (generally calcium carbonate), 
but any of several proprietary compounds, with a silicate base. It was 
around the time of the Industrial Revolution that newer compounds formed 
that provided better grip for the ball. This is when the English began 
to experiment with side spin or applying curl to the ball. This was shortly 
introduced to the American players and is how the term "putting English 
on the ball" came to be. "Chalk" may also refer to a cone of fine, white 
hand chalk; like talc (talcum powder) it can be used to reduce friction 
between the cue and bridge hand during shooting, for a smoother stroke. 
Some brands of hand chalk actually are made of compressed talc. (Tip chalk 
is not used for this purpose because it is abrasive, hand-staining and 
difficult to apply.) Many players prefer a slick pool glove over hand chalk 
or talc because of the messiness of these powders; buildup of particles 
on the cloth will affect ball behavior and necessitate more-frequent cloth 
cleaning. Cue tip chalk (invented in its modern form by straight rail billiard 
pro William A. Spinks and chemist William Hoskins in 1897)[13][14] is made 
by crushing silica and the abrasive substance corundum or aloxite[14] (aluminium 
oxide),[15][16] into a powder.[14] It is combined with dye (originally 
and most commonly green or blue-green, like traditional billiard cloth, 
but available today, like the cloth, in many colors) and a binder (glue).[14] 
Each manufacturer's brand has different qualities, which can significantly 
affect play. High humidity can also impair the effectiveness of chalk. 
Harder, drier compounds are generally considered superior by most players. 
There are two main varieties of billiard games: carom and pocket. The main 
carom billiards games are straight rail, balkline and especially three 
cushion billiards. All are played on a pocketless table with three balls; 
two cue balls and one object ball. In all, players shoot a cue ball so 
that it makes contact with the opponent's cue ball as well as the object 
ball. Others of multinational interest are four-ball and five-pins. The 
most globally popular of the large variety of pocket games are Pool and 
snooker. English billiards, with some features of carom billiards, was 
one of the two most-competitive cue sports, along with balkline, at the 
turn of the previous century and is still enjoyed today especially in Commonwealth 
countries. Russian pyramid and its variants like kaisa are popular in the 
former Eastern bloc. In straight rail, a player scores a point and may 
continue shooting each time his cue ball makes contact with both other 
balls. Although a difficult and subtle game, some of the best players of 
straight billiards developed the skill to gather the balls in a corner 
or along the same rail for the purpose of playing a series of nurse shots 
to score a seemingly limitless number of points. The first straight rail 
professional tournament was held in 1879 where Jacob Schaefer, Sr. scored 
690 points in a single turn[12][page needed] (that is, 690 separate strokes 
without a miss). With the balls repetitively hit and barely moving in endless 
"nursing", there was little for the fans to watch. In light of these phenomenal 
skill developments in straight rail, the game of balkline soon developed 
to make it impossible for a player to keep the balls gathered in one part 
of the table for long, greatly limiting the effectiveness of nurse shots. 
A balkline (not to be confused with baulk line, which pertains to the game 
of English billiards) is a line parallel to one end of a billiards table. 
In the games of balkline – 18.1 and 18.2 (pronounced "eighteen-point-two") 
balkline, among other more obscure variations – the players have to drive 
at least one object ball past a balkline set at 18 inches (460 mm) from 
each rail, after one or two points have been scored, respectively. A more 
elegant solution was three-cushion billiards, which requires a player to 
make contact with the other two balls on the table and contact three rail 
cushions in the process. This is difficult enough that even the best players 
can only manage to average one to two points per turn. There are many variations 
of games played on a standard pool table. Popular pool games include eight-ball, 
nine-ball, straight pool and one-pocket. Even within games types (e.g. 
eight-ball), there may be variations, and people may play recreationally 
using relaxed or local rules. A few of the more popular examples of pool 
games are given below. In eight-ball and nine-ball, the object is to sink 
object balls until one can legally pocket the winning eponymous "money 
ball". Well-known but waning in popularity is straight pool, in which players 
seek to continue sinking balls, rack after rack if they can, to reach a 
pre-determined winning score (typically 150). Related to nine-ball, another 
well-known game is rotation, where the lowest-numbered object ball on the 
table must be struck first, although any object ball may be pocketed (i.e., 
combination shot). Each pocketed ball is worth its number, and the player 
with the highest score at the end of the rack is the winner. Since there 
are only 120 points available (1 + 2 + 3 ⋯ + 15 = 120), scoring 61 points 
leaves no opportunity for the opponent to catch up. In both one-pocket 
and bank pool, the players must sink a set number of balls; respectively, 
all in a particular pocket, or all by bank shots. In snooker, players score 
points by alternately potting red balls and various special "colour balls". 
Speed pool is a standard billiards game where the balls must be pocketed 
in as little time as possible. Rules vary greatly from tournament to tournament. 
The International Speed Pool Challenge has been held annually since 2006. 
Dating to approximately 1800, English billiards, called simply billiards[17] 
in many former British colonies and in the UK where it originated, was 
originally called the winning and losing carambole game, folding in the 
names of three predecessor games, the winning game, the losing game and 
the carambole game (an early form of straight rail), that combined to form 
it.[18] The game features both cannons (caroms) and the pocketing of balls 
as objects of play. English billiards requires two cue balls and a red 
object ball. The object of the game is to score either a fixed number of 
points, or score the most points within a set time frame, determined at 
the start of the game. Points are awarded for: Snooker is a pocket billiards 
game originated by British officers stationed in India during the 19th 
century, based on earlier pool games such as black pool and life pool. 
The name of the game became generalized to also describe one of its prime 
strategies: to "snooker" the opposing player by causing that player to 
foul or leave an opening to be exploited. In the United Kingdom, snooker 
is by far the most popular cue sport at the competitive level, and major 
national pastime along with association football and cricket. It is played 
in many Commonwealth countries as well, especially in Asia. Snooker is 
uncommon in North America, where pool games such as eight-ball and nine-ball 
dominate, and Latin America and Continental Europe, where carom games dominate. 
The first World Snooker Championship was held in 1927, and it has been 
held annually since then with few exceptions. The World Professional Billiards 
and Snooker Association (WPBSA) was established in 1968 to regulate the 
professional game, while the International Billiards and Snooker Federation 
(IBSF) regulates the amateur games. Technically a form of pocket billiards, 
snooker has its own world-wide sporting community separate from that of 
pool. These combine aspects of carom and pocket billiards, and are played 
on tables with pockets (often as hazards not targets). These are variations 
using small disks instead of balls, and light-weight cue sticks. Outdoor 
games played on a lawn, field or court, played with varying equipment that 
may include hoops, pins, holes or other targets or obstacles, and clubs, 
curved-head sticks, or mallets. Most such games are obsolete, aside from 
croquet. Golf and field hockey, as well as stick-less games such as bocce, 
boules and bowls, are historically related. These are developments from 
cue sports that dispense with the cues, and are played with the hands directly.
