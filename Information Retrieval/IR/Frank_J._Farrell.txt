Frank J. Farrell (c. 1866 â€“ February 10, 1926) was an American baseball 
executive. He and William S. Devery were the first owners of the New York 
Highlanders (now New York Yankees). They purchased the Baltimore Orioles 
on January 9, 1903 for $18,000 and moved it to New York City.[1] He was 
born around 1866. Farrell was involved in New York City gambling, and owned 
pool halls and a casino. At one time he was the partner of William Burbridge.[2] 
In 1912 he fired Harry Wolverton as the manager of the Yankees.[3] On January 
29, 1915 Farrell and Devery sold the Yankees to Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast 
L'Hommedieu Huston for $460,000.[4][5][6] Farrell died in Atlantic City, 
New Jersey, of a heart attack, after recovering from a bout of bronchitis.[7]
