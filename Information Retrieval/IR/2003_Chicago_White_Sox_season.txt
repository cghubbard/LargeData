The 2003 Chicago White Sox season was the White Sox's 104th season. They 
finished with a record 86â€“76, good enough for second place in the American 
League Central, four games behind the champion Minnesota Twins. The White 
Sox also hosted the 74th Major League Baseball All-Star Game on July 15. 
On April 15, 2003, a fan came out of the stands during the baseball game 
between the Kansas City Royals and Chicago White Sox and attacked first 
base umpire Laz Diaz.[4] After Carlos Lee flied out to right to end the 
eighth inning, the fan ran on the field and tried to tackle Diaz, wrapping 
his arms around the umpire's legs.[4] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
