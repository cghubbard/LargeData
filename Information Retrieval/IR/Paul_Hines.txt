Paul Aloysius Hines (March 1, 1855 â€“ July 10, 1935) was an American center 
fielder in professional baseball who played in the National Association 
and Major League Baseball from 1872 to 1891. Born in Virginia, he is credited 
with winning baseball's first triple crown in 1878; the accomplishment 
was not noted at the time, as runs batted in would not be counted until 
years later, home runs were rare and home run leadership obscure, and Abner 
Dalrymple was then erroneously recognized as the batting champion. There 
is some controversy over whether Hines was also the first player to turn 
an unassisted triple play, since it was an 8-8-4 Triple Play. Hines probably 
practiced with the original Washington Nationals or played on its junior 
team before joining the National Association with that club in 1872. When 
the original Chicago White Stockings resumed play in 1874, the teenage 
Hines played every game, usually in center field. He remained with the 
club four seasons, including the inaugural National League championship 
season of 1876, and then played eight seasons for the Providence Grays 
from 1878 to 1885, that club's entire major league association including 
two more pennants. He remained an everyday major league center fielder 
through two seasons for a new Washington Nationals club and one for the 
Indianapolis Hoosiers, shifting to first base for a second Indianapolis 
season in 1889. He returned to center field with gradually declining playing 
time for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys, Boston Beaneaters and Washington Statesmen 
in 1890 and 1891. He finished his professional career splitting 1896 between 
Burlington, Iowa and Mobile, Alabama at age 41. During the first five NL 
seasons, from 1876 through 1880, Hines had more base hits than any other 
player, and he retired third to Cap Anson and Jim O'Rourke with 1,884 career 
hits in the majors. He also remained among the top 10 major league career 
home run hitters as late as 1887. His total of 16 seasons as a major league 
team's primary center fielder was not surpassed until Tris Speaker and 
Ty Cobb in 1925. Hines died at age 80 in Hyattsville, Maryland, deaf and
