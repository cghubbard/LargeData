Lewis DeWitt "Snake" Wiltse (December 5, 1871 – August 25, 1928) was a 
pitcher in Major League Baseball. He played for the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
Philadelphia Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, and New York Highlanders from 
1901 to 1903. His brother was fellow major league pitcher George "Hooks" 
Wiltse.[1] Lewis Wiltse was born in Bouckville, New York.[1] Nicknamed 
"Snake", he started playing semi-pro baseball in 1894[2] and then began 
his professional career in 1899 with the Toledo Mud Hens.[3] In January 
1901, Wiltse was acquired by the National League's Pirates. He went 1–4 
and was released in mid-season.[1] Wiltse then signed with the Philadelphia 
Athletics on July 20. He pitched well the rest of the year, going 13–5 
and also batting .326.[1] On August 10, he made history, hitting two doubles 
and two triples for 10 total bases, which set an MLB record for pitchers.[2] 
Wiltse also pitched a shutout in that game.[4] In 1902, Wiltse played for 
the Athletics, going 8–8, before he was sold to the Baltimore Orioles. 
The Baltimore franchise was transferred to New York for the following season, 
and Wiltse continued to pitch poorly. His earned run average was higher 
than 5.00 in 1902 and 1903. He played his final major league game on May 
18, 1903,[1] and then went down to the minors.[2] Wiltse pitched in the 
Eastern League, Tri-State League, and New York State League from 1903 to 
1910. He won 20 games once, in 1904, and finished his career with 69 minor 
league victories[3] to go along with his 29 major league wins.[1] His overall 
major league pitching record was 29 wins and 31 losses in 62 games, with 
an earned run average of 4.59.[1] As a major league hitter, he compiled 
a .278 batting average and a .398 slugging percentage in 284 at bats.[1] 
Wiltse was married and had one daughter.[2] He died in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,
