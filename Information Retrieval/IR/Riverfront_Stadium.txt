Riverfront Stadium, also known as Cinergy Field from 1996 to 2002, was 
a multi-purpose stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States that was the 
home of the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball from 1970 through 
2002 and the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League from 1970 
to 1999. Located on the Ohio River in downtown Cincinnati, the stadium 
was best known as the home of "The Big Red Machine", as the Reds were often 
called in the 1970s. Construction began on February 1, 1968, and was completed 
at a cost of less than $50 million. On June 30, 1970, the Reds hosted the 
Atlanta Braves in their grand opening, with Hank Aaron hitting the first 
ever home run at Riverfront. Two weeks later on July 14, 1970, Riverfront 
hosted the 1970 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. This game is best 
remembered for the often-replayed collision at home plate between Reds 
star Pete Rose and catcher Ray Fosse of the Cleveland Indians. In September 
1996, Riverfront Stadium was renamed "Cinergy Field" in a sponsorship deal 
with Greater Cincinnati energy company Cinergy. In 2001, to make room for 
Great American Ball Park, the seating capacity at Cinergy Field was reduced 
to 39,000. There was a huge wall in center field visible after the renovations, 
to serve as the batter's eye. The stadium was demolished by implosion on 
December 29, 2002. Riverfront was a multi-purpose, circular "cookie-cutter" 
stadium, one of many built in the United States in the late 1960s and early 
1970s as communities sought to save money by having their football and 
baseball teams share the same facility. Riverfront, Busch Memorial Stadium 
in St. Louis, Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Three Rivers Stadium 
in Pittsburgh, Shea Stadium in New York and Robert F. Kennedy Memorial 
Stadium in Washington, D.C. all opened within a few years of each other 
and were largely indistinguishable from one another; in particular, it 
was often confused with fellow Ohio River cookie-cutter Three Rivers Stadium 
by sportscasters because of the two stadium's similar names and similar 
designs. One feature of Riverfront that was an improvement compared to 
some of its fellow "cookie-cutters" was the fact that the lower level field 
box ("blue") seats for baseball from home plate to the left field foul 
line were movable in an arc along curved tracks so that the field level 
seats on both sidelines in the football configuration were parallel to, 
and thus closer to, the football field than in some of the other cookie-cutter 
stadia.[3] The astroturf panels covering the tracks could be seen in left 
field during Reds games. (Shea Stadium in New York had featured a similar 
movable field-level seats design from its debut in 1964 until the Jets 
moved to Giants Stadium in New Jersey in 1984, after which the Mets retrofitted 
Shea for exclusive baseball use.[4] A variation of this design was also 
used at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh.)[5] The site on which Riverfront 
Stadium sat originally included the 2nd Street tenement, birthplace and 
boyhood home of cowboy singer and actor Roy Rogers, who joked that he was 
born "somewhere between second base and center field." Riverfront Stadium's 
scoreboard was designed by American Sign and Indicator, but in its last 
years was maintained by Trans-Lux. That scoreboard would be upgraded in 
the 1980s with the addition of an adjacent Sony JumboTron. The Reds moved 
to Riverfront Stadium midway through the 1970 season, after spending over 
86 years at the intersection of Findlay Street and Western Avenue – the 
last 57½ of those years at Crosley Field. Riverfront quickly earned a place 
in Cincinnati's century-long baseball tradition as the home of one of the 
best teams in baseball history. The Reds had only won three pennants in 
their final 39 years at Crosley Field (1939, 1940, 1961) but made the World 
Series in Riverfront's first year (1970) and a total of four times in the 
stadium's first seven years, with the Reds winning back-to-back championships 
in 1975 and 1976. The World Series would return in 1990, with Cincinnati 
winning the first two of a four-game sweep of the Oakland Athletics at 
Riverfront. Baseball purists disliked Riverfront's artificial turf, but 
Reds' Manager Sparky Anderson and General Manager Bob Howsam took advantage 
of it by encouraging speed and line drive hitting that could produce doubles, 
triples and high-bouncing infield hits. Players who combined power and 
speed like Joe Morgan, Pete Rose and Ken Griffey, Sr. thrived there. On 
defense, the fast surface and virtually dirtless infield (see photo) rewarded 
range and quickness by both outfielders and infielders, like shortstop 
Dave Concepción who used the turf to bounce many of his long throws to 
first. Catcher Johnny Bench and first baseman Tony Pérez played here. The 
artificial turf covered not only the normal grass area of the ballpark 
but is usually the "skinned" portion of the infield. Only the pitcher's 
mound, the home plate area, and cutouts around first, second and third 
bases had dirt surfaces. This was the first stadium in the majors with 
this "sliding pit" configuration. The new stadiums that would follow (Veterans 
Stadium, Royals Stadium, Louisiana Superdome, Olympic Stadium (Montreal), 
Exhibition Stadium, Kingdome, Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, B.C. Place, 
SkyDome) would install sliding pits as the original layout, and the existing 
artificial turf fields in San Francisco, Houston, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis 
would change to the cut-out configuration within the next few years. Riverfront 
hosted the MLB All-Star Game twice. First on July 14, 1970 with President 
Richard Nixon in attendance (51,838 total attendance), and again on July 
12, 1988 (55,837 attendance). Despite Cincinnati's love of baseball, it 
was the prospect of a professional football team that finally moved the 
city to end 20 years of discussion and build a new stadium on the downtown 
riverfront. After playing for two seasons at Nippert Stadium on the University 
of Cincinnati campus, the Bengals built on the Reds' success in the stadium's 
first year when they recorded their first winning season and first playoff 
appearance in 1970, just their third year of existence. Perhaps the most 
memorable football game at Riverfront was the AFC Championship on January 
10, 1982. The game became known as the Freezer Bowl and was won by the 
Bengals over the San Diego Chargers, 27–7. The air temperature during the 
game was −9 °F (−23 °C) and the wind chill was −37 °F (−38 °C), the coldest 
in NFL history. The win earned the Bengals their first of two trips to 
the Super Bowl (XVI) while playing at Riverfront. Riverfront Stadium hosted 
the 1988 AFC Championship, as the Bengals beat the Buffalo Bills 21–10 
to advance to their second Super Bowl appearance. During the Bengals' tenure, 
they defeated every visiting franchise at least once, enjoying perfect 
records against the Arizona Cardinals (4-0), New York Giants (4-0), and 
Philadelphia Eagles (3-0). They posted a 5–1 record in playoff games played 
in Riverfront Stadium, with victories over the Buffalo Bills (twice), San 
Diego Chargers, Seattle Seahawks, and Houston Oilers. Their only home playoff 
loss came to the New York Jets. For most of the Bengals' tenure at the 
stadium, the field contained only the basic markings required for play. 
Until the late 1990s, there wasn't a logo at midfield or any writing in 
the end zone, which had long become standard in NFL stadiums. During the 
1988 season as the Bengals were making a Super Bowl run, Riverfront Stadium 
was nicknamed the Jungle as the Bengals went a perfect 10-0 at home during 
the regular season and in the playoffs. With the new stadium nickname, 
the fans and team adopted the Guns N' Roses song "Welcome to the Jungle" 
as the unofficial theme song for the Bengals. When Paul Brown Stadium opened 
in 2000, the Jungle theme was incorporated into the stadium design. Between 
1970 and 1990 Riverfront Stadium hosted some 25 University of Cincinnati 
football games to accommodate higher-caliber visiting teams and local rivals 
which would overwhelm demand in their usual home, Nippert Stadium (which 
then could only hold 28,000). Among the Bearcats' opponents were the University 
of Alabama, University of Maryland, University of Kentucky, University 
of Louisville, Boston College, West Virginia University, Penn State University, 
whose 1985 game took place with the Nittany Lions number one in the coaches' 
poll, and the University of Miami three times, twice while the Hurricanes 
were the defending national champions. When the Bengals moved to Paul Brown 
Stadium in 2000, the Reds were left as Cinergy Field's only tenant. Prior 
to the 2001 baseball season, the stadium was remodeled into a baseball-only 
configuration, and the artificial surface was replaced with grass. To allow 
room for the construction of Great American Ball Park (which was being 
built largely over the grounds the stadium already sat on), a large section 
of the left and center field stands were removed and the distance to the 
fences was shortened by five feet. The new Great American Ball Park and 
old Riverfront Stadium were 26 inches apart at its closest point during 
this time. Consequently, in its last years, the stadium achieved an openness 
and a degree of aesthetic appeal that it had lacked for most of its existence. 
In the Reds' final two seasons in the stadium, ongoing construction on 
Great American was plainly visible just beyond the outfield walls while 
the team played their games. The stadium was demolished by implosion on 
December 29, 2002. Any debris was removed and scrapped. Today, part of 
the site is now occupied by the Great American Ball Park with some parking 
lots over the old site. A small portion of the Riverfront Stadium site 
is now occupied by the Reds' Hall of Fame and Museum and Main Street, which 
was extended when the new park was built and when the old park was demolished.
