John Milton "Mickey" Rivers (born October 31, 1948) is an American former 
baseball player who played in Major League Baseball from 1970 to 1984 for 
the California Angels, New York Yankees, and Texas Rangers. As a member 
of the Yankees, he was part of their two World Series champions, both over 
the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was generally known as a speedy leadoff hitter 
who made contact and was an excellent center fielder, with a below-average 
throwing arm. Originally signed by the Atlanta Braves, "Mick The Quick" 
began his big league career in 1970 with the Angels playing center field 
and third base, and stayed with them through the 1975 season. Rivers played 
part-time in his first few years, until becoming the starter in 1974. He 
led the league in triples both years and swiped a career-high 70 bases 
in 1975, tops in the American League. Along with Ed Figueroa, Rivers was 
dealt to the Yankees in the 1975-76 off-season for Bobby Bonds, a trade 
which immediately paid dividends for the Yankees. Figueroa won 19 games 
and Rivers enjoyed a career year. Rivers was named to the All-Star team, 
batted .312, stole 43 bases and posted then-career highs in home runs (8) 
and runs batted in (67). Rivers placed third in the Most Valuable Player 
voting behind teammate Thurman Munson and George Brett and was named an 
outfielder on The Sporting News AL All-Star team. Rivers posted good numbers 
in his two other full seasons as a part of the "Bronx Zoo", including a 
.326 batting average in 1977, but was traded in the middle of the 1979 
season to Texas. There he set the single-season record for hits by a Ranger 
with 210 in 1980, a mark since eclipsed by Michael Young. He concluded 
his career in 1984 with a .295 lifetime average, 267 stolen bases, and 
1,660 hits. While Rivers played for them, the Yankees won the World Series 
in 1977 and 1978, both times against the Los Angeles Dodgers. They also 
won the 1976 pennant, but lost in the World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. 
Rivers posted a .308 average in his 29 postseason games. Bill James ranked 
Mickey Rivers as the 59th greatest center fielder of all time. Rivers was 
honored with many of his teammates from the 1977 World Series champion 
New York Yankees, in the Yankee Old Timers Game in 2007. In The Bronx Is 
Burning, the ESPN minseries based on the 1977 Yankees, he was portrayed 
by Leonard Robinson and portrayed as a person with financial problems. 
When Reggie Jackson once remarked to a reporter that he had an IQ of 160, 
Rivers responded, "Out of what, a thousand?". Since his playing career 
ended, Rivers has trained racehorses in his native Florida. His son, Mickey 
Rivers Jr. played minor league baseball in the Rangers organization, and
