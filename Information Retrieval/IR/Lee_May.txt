Lee Andrew May (born March 23, 1943 in Birmingham, Alabama) is a retired 
American Major League Baseball (MLB) first baseman and designated hitter 
who played 18-seasons for the Cincinnati Reds (1965–71), Houston Astros 
(1972–74), Baltimore Orioles (1975–80), and Kansas City Royals (1981–82). 
He batted and threw right-handed. He is the older brother of former Chicago 
White Sox and New York Yankees outfielder Carlos May. May, nicknamed "The 
Big Bopper", hit 20 or more home runs and 80 or more run batted in (RBI), 
in 11 consecutive seasons.[1] He led the American League (AL) in RBI in 
1976. May also made three All-Star Game appearances including being named 
the starting first baseman for the National League (NL) team in 1972.[2] 
May was a standout in both baseball and football at A.H. Parker High School 
in Birmingham. A fullback on the varsity football team, May was offered 
a scholarship at the University of Nebraska. But the Cincinnati Reds organization 
were also interested in him and signed May to a contract with a $12,000 
bonus on June 1, 1961 as an amateur free agent.[2][3] May began his professional 
career in 1961 with the Tampa Tarpons in the Florida State League, a D-league 
affiliate of the Reds. He played two years in Tampa before moving up to 
the Rocky Mount Leafs in the Class A Carolina League. The following year 
he was again promoted, this time to the Macon Peaches in the Class AA Southern 
League.[4] At all three stops, May, like many black players, endured racist 
taunts not only from an opposing team's white fans but from the fans of 
his own team as well.[3] May hated his time in Macon, Georgia the most. 
Not only did he hear racist epithets, but he also had to avoid thrown bottles. 
Fortunately, May's emergence in 1964, allowed him to be promoted the following 
year to the San Diego Padres, who were then in the Class AAA Pacific Coast 
League. During his only season with the Padres, May was one of the best 
players in the league. He hit 34 home runs while driving in 103 runs and 
hitting .321. He was called up briefly to the Reds at the end of season 
but then moved to the Reds new Class AAA International League team, the 
Buffalo Bisons in 1966. A solid AAA season at Buffalo led to his permanent 
major league promotion.[4] May made his major league debut on September 
1, 1965. He came in as a pinch hitter against the Milwaukee Braves.[5] 
On September 24, 1966 at Crosley Field in Cincinnati, he hit his first 
major league home run against Bob Shaw of the New York Mets. It turned 
out to be the game-winning homer.[6] May broke camp as a full-time member 
of the Reds in 1967. That season, May was named NL Rookie of the Year by 
The Sporting News.[7] He was also named to the Topps All-Star rookie team.[8] 
The next two years saw much of the construction of the future The Big Red 
Machine. Along with Johnny Bench, Tony Pérez, and Pete Rose, May helped 
power arguably one of baseball's great offenses. In 1968, he hit 22 home 
runs and drove in 80 runs.[2] Despite only walking 38 times and striking 
out 100 times, he still had an OPS of .805 which was remarkable during 
the Year of the Pitcher.[9] In 1969, he finished the year with 38 home 
runs, 3rd in the National League. He also had 110 RBIs which was 4th in 
the league. May was also 2nd in extra base hits, 4th in total bases, 6th 
in slugging percentage and 6th in doubles.[2] Also in 1969, May had three 
consecutive multi-home run games, a feat that has only happened three other 
times in major league history.[10] Teammate Tommy Helms nicknamed May "The 
Big Bopper of Birmingham" (which later was shortened to "The Big Bopper"). 
During his time in Cincinnati, May was one of the clubhouse leaders for 
the Reds. With his pragmatic personality and comic sense of timing, manager 
Sparky Anderson often called on May to put out clubhouse fires.[11] In 
1970, the Reds pounded nearly everyone into submission. Batting in the 
fifth slot, May delivered 94 runs batted in. On June 24, 1970, May hit 
the last home run in the history of Crosley Field during the park's final 
game. The game-winning shot came in the eighth inning off San Francisco 
Giants pitcher Juan Marichal.[12] May was the only member of The Big Red 
Machine to produce in the 1970 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. 
Pete Rose batted .250, MVP winner Johnny Bench hit .211, and Tony Pérez 
slumped to .056. May, on the other hand, batted .389 with two home runs 
and eight RBI (a World Series record for a five-game series at the time[11]) 
. In game four, the Orioles were leading 5-3 in the 8th inning and looking 
to sweep the series. The Reds had two baserunners on when May came to the 
plate against Eddie Watt. May hit a ball into the left field bleachers 
at Memorial Stadium (Baltimore) to lead the Reds to their one and only 
victory of the series.[13] Although the Reds slumped in 1971, May continued 
to slug away, hitting 39 home runs (3rd in the NL) and driving in 98 RBIs 
(6th in NL).[14] Consequently, May was named the Reds MVP for the 1971 
season.[11] With the Reds needing to shore up their infield defense and 
add speed on the basepaths and seeing Tony Pérez and May as essentially 
the same type of player (right-handed power hitters), the Reds sent May 
to the Houston Astros for future Hall of Famer Joe Morgan. The Astros, 
badly in need of power after finishing last in the NL in home runs in 1971, 
completed a trade with the Reds on November 29, 1971 that sent second baseman 
Morgan, pitcher Jack Billingham, infielder Denis Menke, outfielder César 
Gerónimo and minor leaguer Ed Armbrister for May, second baseman Tommy 
Helms and utility man Jimmy Stewart. May brought much-needed power to the 
Astro line-up. Although his power numbers dropped in the Astrodome, the 
toughest ballpark to hit a home run in the National League,[15] he continued 
to drive in runs on a regular basis. His 105 RBI in 1973 was second in 
the league.[2] During the 1973 season, May set an Astro club record with 
a 21-game hitting streak. It was during this streak he hit three home runs 
in one game (also a club record) and collected his 1000th base hit.[16] 
On April 29, 1974, May became the 17th player in MLB history to hit two 
home runs in one inning.[17] On December 23, 1974, May was traded to the 
Baltimore Orioles, along with minor league outfielder Jay Schlueter for 
infielder/outfielder Enos Cabell and second baseman Rob Andrews. May took 
an immediate liking to the American League. In his first at bat in the 
junior circuit, he hit a three-run home run at Tiger Stadium.[18] In his 
first appearance at Boston's Fenway Park, May crushed two three-run home 
runs over the park's famed Green Monster including a game-winning shot.[19][20] 
In 1976, May enjoyed his best season as an Oriole. He hit 25 home runs 
and led the American League in RBI with 109.[2] For his effort, May won 
the Louis M. Hatter Most Valuable Oriole Award. In his last three seasons 
with the Orioles, May was primarily used as a designated hitter to make 
room for a young Eddie Murray at first base. Although May was a major contributor 
in 1979 with 19 homers and 69 RBI, in the 1979 World Series, he only came 
to bat twice because the DH was not used in that series. After being allowed 
to leave the Orioles via free agency after the 1980 season, May signed 
with the Royals as part-time 1B/DH/pinch hitter. Despite hitting .308 in 
only 48 games in 1982, the 39-year-old May was released by the team in 
November and he decided to call it a career. Following his release from 
the Royals, he was hired back as the team's hitting coach and earned a 
World Series ring as part of the 1985 World Series championship team.[21] 
In his 18-season career, May posted a .267 batting average, with 354 home 
runs, 1244 runs batted in, and 2031 hits in 2071 games. May was prone to 
strike out; 10 times he fanned more than 100 times in a season and compiled 
1,570 in his career. However, he is one of 11 major leaguers to reach the 
100-RBI plateau playing for three teams, the others being Dick Allen, Joe 
Carter, Orlando Cepeda, Rocky Colavito, Goose Goslin, Rogers Hornsby, Reggie 
Jackson, Al Simmons, Vic Wertz, and Alex Rodriguez.[citation needed] May 
is currently in three different Halls of Fame. In 1998, May was inducted 
into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame.[22] In 2006, May was elected to 
the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.[11] In 2009, May was selected to the 
Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.[23] Lee May and his wife, Terrye,[24][25] 
have three children and nine grandchildren. His son, Lee May, Jr., was 
a New York Mets first-round pick in 1986 and played from 1986 through 1993 
in their Minor League system.[26] After that, he began his coaching career 
in the Mets organization in 1999 and later worked as the minor league hitting 
coordinator for the Seattle Mariners from 2012–2015. He previously served 
as a manager and coach in the Cleveland Indians system for seven seasons 
beginning in 2004, and then joined the Boston Red Sox organization in 2016, 
serving as the hitting coach for the Greenville Drive. May Jr.'s son, Jacob 
May, played baseball at Coastal Carolina University, and was selected by 
the Chicago White Sox in the third round (91st overall) of the 2013 MLB 
Draft.[27] May was featured in a Sports Illustrated story about TV character 
Sam Malone (played by Ted Danson) from the show Cheers. Fictitiously, Malone 
was a former major league pitcher who served up a pitch that May crushed 
all the way out of Baltimore's Memorial Stadium.[28] May was also mentioned 
in a chapter about the Kingdome in the book Notes From a 12th Man: A Truly
