Cornelius "Neal" Ball (April 22, 1881 – October 15, 1957) was an American 
baseball shortstop who played seven seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He played for the New York Highlanders, Cleveland Naps and Boston Red Sox 
from 1907 to 1913. Although his primary position was shortstop, Ball played 
at second base, third base and in the outfield as well. He is most famous 
for being the first player to turn an unassisted triple play in Major League 
Baseball history on July 19, 1909. Ball played minor league baseball for 
the Montgomery Senators of the Southern League until 1907, when he signed 
for the New York Highlanders. After spending less than three seasons with 
the organization, Ball was sold to the Cleveland Naps, where he spent the 
next two seasons. In the middle of the 1912 season, his contract was then 
purchased by the Boston Red Sox, with whom he played his last game on June 
30, 1913. He died on October 15, 1957 in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Ball 
was born on April 22, 1881 in Grand Haven, Michigan.[1] After his Major 
League career ended, he went on to coach the Baltimore Orioles (who were 
a minor league team at the time). It was there that he was assigned to 
train Babe Ruth, who had just come out of St. Mary's Industrial School 
for Boys. Ball described Ruth as "the dumbest and yet the strongest player"[2] 
he had ever coached. The two remained good friends after Ruth broke into 
the Majors and even played a friendly game of bowling against one another 
in 1923 (with Ball edging out Ruth, winning four out of the seven games 
played).[3] Ruth held Ball in great respect, and because of their close 
friendship in baseball, he eventually became a fan of the New York Yankees.[2] 
In the 1950s, an annual bowling tournament held at the Newfield Alleys 
near Bridgeport, Connecticut was named after Ball in order to honor the 
city's famous inhabitant.[4] On February 12, 1952, at the age of 71, his 
health severely deteriorated due to a heart ailment and he was rushed to 
Bridgeport Hospital, where he was placed on the danger list and visitors 
were prohibited from seeing him.[5] Five years later, he died on October 
15, 1957[6] and was interred at Mountain Grove Cemetery, Bridgeport.[1] 
Ball first started playing organized baseball on the semi-pro team in Three 
Rivers, Michigan, where he played in a game against Hall of Fame Negro 
League star Rube Foster of the Otsego Independents during the 1902 season. 
He then proceeded to play for Montgomery Senators, a minor league baseball 
team that competed in the Southern League.[7] He played for the team until 
1907, when he signed for the New York Highlanders.[1] He made his major 
league debut for the Highlanders on September 12, 1907, at the age of 26, 
in a 2–0 loss against the Washington Senators.[8] During his 1908 rookie 
season, Ball posted a batting average of .247 and led the Majors in strikeouts 
with 91. Defensively, he committed the most errors among all fielders in 
the American League with 81 and most errors by a shortstop with 80,[1] 
both of which are Yankee rookie records that still stand today.[9] However, 
he also set the team record for most assists by a rookie with 438[9] (this 
record has since been broken by Derek Jeter, who had 444 assists in 1996).[10] 
On May 18, 1909, in the middle of the season, Ball was bought by the Cleveland 
Naps for approximately $5000.[11] "I am mighty glad I happened to be the 
one who was in the right spot and able to pull it off. Just think of the 
wonderful plays that Larry [Lajoie], Terry Turner and Bill Bradley have 
made since they have been in the major leagues, but yet they never had 
the chance to do what I, a utility man, a sub, did. It was just my good 
fortune to be in the game when such a chance was offered." Ball was brought 
in to serve as the temporary replacement for Cleveland's injured starting 
shortstop Terry Turner, who suffered from a recurring arm injury that needed 
treatment.[11] In his first season with the Indians, Ball batted .256 with 
one home run and 25 runs batted in.[1] Although he was never famous for 
his defensive skills,[13] he achieved baseball history when he executed 
the first unassisted triple play in the MLB on July 19, 1909, doing so 
against the Boston Red Sox at League Park.[2][14][15] In the second inning 
of the game, Ball, playing shortstop, caught Amby McConnell's line drive, 
stepped on second base to retire Heinie Wagner, and then tagged outfielder 
Jake Stahl as he was advancing towards second.[16] Because the play was 
unprecedented and turned so swiftly, the ballplayers on the field did not 
know the inning was over and the crowd of 11,000 were unsure of how to 
react. Cy Young, the game's starting pitcher, was puzzled and asked Ball 
why he was leaving the field.[2] Once the fans in attendance realized what 
had happened, they gave him an ovation, while his teammates applauded him 
as he returned to the dugout.[2][17] In the following inning, with the 
crowd still cheering, he hit an inside-the-park home run into center field 
(the only home run he hit that season).[1][2] After the game, he was questioned 
in a post-game interview, a rare occurrence at the time.[12] He remained 
humble about the feat and reminded the reporters that "anyone could have 
made the play".[12] The glove that he used to make the unassisted triple 
play is on exhibit at the Baseball Hall of Fame.[2] At the end of the 1910 
season, after playing just 54 games with the team,[1] Ball was sent down 
and released to the Portland Beavers.[18][19] He refused to play for the 
minor league team and this, coupled with the underperformance of the infielders 
brought in to replace him, resulted in the Naps repurchasing his contract.[20] 
The 1911 season turned out to be Ball's best statistical year, resulting 
in several career high numbers being set. He batted .296 and amassed 122 
hits, 9 triples, 45 RBI and hit 3 home runs, though he also recorded the 
third highest number of strikeouts in the AL with 93. Although his defense 
was never stellar,[1] he executed two noted plays that season. He made 
a one-handed stop against the Chicago White Sox that was described as "marvelous" 
by the New York Times[21] and held the Yankees (his former team) to a 3–3 
draw when Ball, serving as the cut-off man, successfully relayed the ball 
thrown from right fielder Shoeless Joe Jackson to catcher Gus Fisher. In 
doing so, he nailed Birdie Cree (who represented the Yankees' winning run) 
at home plate and the game was immediately suspended due to darkness.[22] 
However, in a rematch against the White Sox on May 5, 1912, Ball suffered 
a momentary defensive lapse that ultimately cost his team the game. In 
the sixth inning, he was unable to catch Shano Collins stealing second 
base and then inexplicably held onto the ball. This allowed Ping Bodie 
to advance to home plate and score the winning run.[23] On June 25, the 
Boston Red Sox purchased Ball's contract from the Naps for $2500.[1] Ball's 
final major league team was ironically the one he turned his unassisted 
triple play against.[2] The player who was final out of that play, Jake 
Stahl, became his manager and teammate.[24] The Red Sox signed Ball with 
the intention of using him only as a utility player who would be a competent 
substitute to any injured players on the team. As a result, he rarely started 
a game for the Red Sox.[25] The team advanced to the World Series at the 
end of that season,[24] where they defeated the New York Giants 4–3.[26] 
Although he struck out in his only plate appearance of the series,[1] he 
still received the prize money of $4025 rewarded to players on the winning 
team.[27] This prompted the Ottawa Citizen to label him "the luckiest man 
in baseball."[27] After playing his final major league season in 1913, 
Ball returned to minor league baseball and played for several teams until 
1924.[28] Most notably, in May 1916, he was traded by the Toronto Maple 
Leafs to his hometown team, the Bridgeport Hustlers of the Eastern League, 
and became both their manager and second baseman.[29] The Hustlers were 
struggling at the time and the addition of Ball did nothing to change the 
team's fortunes. By July, the Hustlers were still languishing in last place
