Richmond (/ˈrɪtʃmənd/ RICH-mənd) is the capital of the Commonwealth of 
Virginia, in the United States. It is the center of the Richmond Metropolitan 
Statistical Area (MSA) and the Greater Richmond Region. While it was incorporated 
in 1742, Richmond has been an independent city since 1871. As of the 2010 
census, the population was 204,214;[7] in 2015, the population was estimated 
to be 220,289,[7] the fourth-most populous city in Virginia. The Richmond 
Metropolitan Area has a population of 1,260,029, the third-most populous 
metro in the state. Richmond is located at the fall line of the James River, 
44 miles (71 km) west of Williamsburg, 66 miles (106 km) east of Charlottesville, 
and 98 miles (158 km) south of Washington, D.C. Surrounded by Henrico and 
Chesterfield counties, the city is located at the intersections of Interstate 
95 and Interstate 64, and encircled by Interstate 295 and Virginia State 
Route 288. Major suburbs include Midlothian to the southwest, Glen Allen 
to the north and west, Short Pump to the west and Mechanicsville to the 
northeast. The site of Richmond had been an important village of the Powhatan 
Confederacy, and was briefly settled by English colonists from Jamestown 
in 1609, and in 1610–1611. The present city of Richmond was founded in 
1737. It became the capital of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia in 1780. 
During the Revolutionary War period, several notable events occurred in 
the city, including Patrick Henry's "Give me liberty or give me death" 
speech in 1775 at St. John's Church, and the passage of the Virginia Statute 
for Religious Freedom written by Thomas Jefferson. During the American 
Civil War, Richmond served as the capital of the Confederate States of 
America. The city entered the 20th century with one of the world's first 
successful electric streetcar systems, as well as a national hub of African-American 
commerce and culture, the Jackson Ward neighborhood. Richmond's economy 
is primarily driven by law, finance, and government, with federal, state, 
and local governmental agencies, as well as notable legal and banking firms, 
located in the downtown area. The city is home to both the United States 
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, one of 13 United States courts 
of appeals, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, one of 12 Federal 
Reserve Banks. Dominion Resources and MeadWestvaco, Fortune 500 companies, 
are headquartered in the city, with others in the metropolitan area.[8] 
After the first permanent English-speaking settlement was established in 
April 1607, at Jamestown, Virginia, Captain Christopher Newport led explorers 
northwest up the James River, to an area that was inhabited by Powhatan 
Native Americans.[9] In 1737, planter William Byrd II commissioned Major 
William Mayo to lay out the original town grid. Byrd named the city "Richmond" 
after the English town of Richmond near (and now part of) London, because 
the view of the James River was strikingly similar to the view of the River 
Thames from Richmond Hill in England, where he had spent time during his 
youth. The settlement was laid out in April 1737, and was incorporated 
as a town in 1742.[10] In 1775, Patrick Henry delivered his famous "Give 
me Liberty or Give me Death" speech in St. John's Church in Richmond, crucial 
for deciding Virginia's participation in the First Continental Congress 
and setting the course for revolution and independence.[11] On April 18, 
1780, the state capital was moved from the colonial capital of Williamsburg 
to Richmond, to provide a more centralized location for Virginia's increasing 
westerly population, as well as to isolate the capital from British attack.[12] 
The latter motive proved to be in vain, and in 1781, under the command 
of Benedict Arnold, Richmond was burned by British troops, causing Governor 
Thomas Jefferson to flee as the Virginia militia, led by Sampson Mathews, 
defended the city.[13] Richmond recovered quickly from the war, and by 
1782 was once again a thriving city.[14] In 1786, the Virginia Statute 
for Religious Freedom (drafted by Thomas Jefferson) was passed at the temporary 
capitol in Richmond, providing the basis for the separation of church and 
state, a key element in the development of the freedom of religion in the 
United States.[15] A permanent home for the new government, the Virginia 
State Capitol building, was designed by Thomas Jefferson with the assistance 
of Charles-Louis Clérisseau, and was completed in 1788. After the American 
Revolutionary War, Richmond emerged as an important industrial center. 
To facilitate the transfer of cargo from the flat-bottomed James River 
bateaux above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below, George Washington 
helped design the James River and Kanawha Canal from Westham to Richmond, 
in the 18th century to bypass Richmond's rapids, with the intent of providing 
a water route across the Appalachians to the Kanawha River. The legacy 
of the canal boatmen is represented by the figure in the center of the 
city flag. As a result of this and ample access to hydropower due to the 
falls, Richmond became home to some of the largest manufacturing facilities 
in the country, including iron works and flour mills, the largest facilities 
of their kind in the South. The resistance to the slave trade was growing 
by the mid-nineteenth century; in one famous case in 1848, Henry "Box" 
Brown made history by having himself nailed into a small box and shipped 
from Richmond to abolitionists in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, escaping 
slavery.[16] On April 17, 1861, five days after the Confederate attack 
on Fort Sumter, the legislature voted to secede from the United States 
and joined the Confederacy. Official action came in May, after the Confederacy 
promised to move its national capital to Richmond. The city was at the 
end of a long supply line, which made it somewhat difficult to defend, 
although supplies continued to reach the city by canal and wagon for years, 
since it was protected by the Army of Northern Virginia and arguably the 
Confederacy's best troops and commanders.[17] It became the main target 
of Union armies, especially in the campaigns of 1862 and 1864-5. In addition 
to Virginia and Confederate government offices and hospitals, a railroad 
hub, and one of the South's largest slave markets, Richmond had the largest 
factory in the Confederacy, the Tredegar Iron Works, which turned out artillery 
and other munitions, including the 723 tons of armor plating that covered 
the CSS Virginia, the world's first ironclad used in war, as well as much 
of the Confederates' heavy ordnance machinery.[18] The Confederate Congress 
shared quarters with the Virginia General Assembly in the Virginia State 
Capitol, with the Confederacy's executive mansion, the "White House of 
the Confederacy", located two blocks away. The Seven Days Battles followed 
in late June and early July 1862, during which Union General McClellan 
threatened to take Richmond but ultimately failed. Three years later, as 
March 1865 ended, the Confederate capitol became indefensible. On March 
25, Confederate General John B. Gordon's desperate attack on Fort Stedman 
east of Petersburg failed. On April 1, General Philip Sheridan, assigned 
to interdict the Southside Railroad, met brigades commanded by George Pickett 
at the Five Forks junction, smashing them, taking thousands of prisoners, 
and encouraging General Grant to order a general advance. When the Union 
Sixth Corps broke through Confederate lines on Boydton Plank Road south 
of Petersburg, Confederate casualties exceeded 5000, or about a tenth of 
Lee's defending army. General Lee then informed Jefferson Davis that he 
was about to evacuate Richmond.[19] Davis and his cabinet left the city 
by train that night, as government officials burned documents and departing 
Confederate troops burned tobacco and other warehouses to deny their contents 
to the victors. On April 2, 1865, General Godfrey Weitzel, commander of 
the 25th corps of the United States Colored Troops, accepted the city's 
surrender from the mayor and group of leading citizens who remained.[20] 
The Union troops eventually managed to stop the raging fires but about 
25% of the city's buildings were destroyed-[21] President Abraham Lincoln 
visited General Grant at Petersburg on April 3, and took a launch to Richmond 
the next day, while Jefferson Davis attempted to organize his Confederate 
government at Danville. Lincoln met Confederate assistant secretary of 
War John A. Campbell, and handed him a note inviting Virginia's legislature 
to end their rebellion. After Campbell spun the note to Confederate legislators 
as a possible end to the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln rescinded his 
offer and ordered General Weitzel to prevent the Confederate state legislature 
from meeting. Union forces killed, wounded or captured 8000 Confederate 
troops at Saylor's Creek southwest of Petersburg on April 6. General Lee 
continued to reject General Grant's surrender suggestion until Sheridan's 
infantry and cavalry appeared in front of his retreating army on April 
8. He surrendered his remaining approximately 10000 troops at Appomattox 
Court House the following morning.[22] Jefferson Davis retreated to North 
Carolina, then further south, when Lincoln rejected the surrender terms 
negotiated by general Sherman and envoys of North Carolina governor Zebulon 
Vance, which failed to mention slavery. Davis was captured on May 10 near 
Irwinville, Georgia and taken back to Virginia, where he was charged with 
treason and imprisoned for two years at Fort Monroe until freed on bail.[23] 
Richmond emerged a decade after the smoldering rubble of the Civil War 
to resume its position as an economic powerhouse, with iron front buildings 
and massive brick factories. Canal traffic peaked in the 1860s and slowly 
gave way to railroads, allowing Richmond to become a major railroad crossroads, 
eventually including the site of the world's first triple railroad crossing.[24] 
Tobacco warehousing and processing continued to play a role, boosted by 
the world's first cigarette-rolling machine, invented by James Albert Bonsack 
of Roanoke in 1880/81. Contributing to Richmond's resurgence was the first 
successful electrically powered trolley system in the United States, the 
Richmond Union Passenger Railway. Designed by electric power pioneer Frank 
J. Sprague, the trolley system opened its first line in 1888, and electric 
streetcar lines rapidly spread to other cities across the country.[25] 
Sprague's system used an overhead wire and trolley pole to collect current, 
with electric motors on the car's trucks.[26] In Richmond, the transition 
from streetcars to buses began in May 1947 and was completed on November 
25, 1949.[27] By the beginning of the 20th century, the city's population 
had reached 85,050 in 5 square miles (13 km2), making it the most densely 
populated city in the Southern United States.[28] In 1900, the Census Bureau 
reported Richmond's population as 62.1% white and 37.9% black.[29] Freed 
slaves and their descendants created a thriving African-American business 
community, and the city's historic Jackson Ward became known as the "Wall 
Street of Black America." In 1903, African-American businesswoman and financier 
Maggie L. Walker chartered St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, and served as its 
first president, as well as the first female bank president in the United 
States. Today, the bank is called the Consolidated Bank and Trust Company, 
and it is the oldest surviving African-American bank in the U.S.[30] Other 
figures from this time included John Mitchell, Jr. In 1910, the former 
city of Manchester was consolidated with the city of Richmond, and in 1914, 
the city annexed Barton Heights, Ginter Park, and Highland Park areas of 
Henrico County.[31] In May 1914, Richmond became the headquarters of the 
Fifth District of the Federal Reserve Bank. Several major performing arts 
venues were constructed during the 1920s, including what are now the Landmark 
Theatre, Byrd Theatre, and Carpenter Theatre. The city's first radio station, 
WRVA, began broadcasting in 1925. WTVR-TV (CBS 6), the first television 
station in Richmond, was the first television station south of Washington, 
D.C.[32] Between 1963 and 1965, there was a "downtown boom" that led to 
the construction of more than 700 buildings in the city. In 1968, Virginia 
Commonwealth University was created by the merger of the Medical College 
of Virginia with the Richmond Professional Institute.[33] In 1970, Richmond's 
borders expanded by an additional 27 square miles (70 km2) on the south. 
After several years of court cases in which Chesterfield County fought 
annexation, more than 47,000 people who once were Chesterfield County residents 
found themselves within the city's perimeters on January 1, 1970.[34] In 
1996, still-sore tensions arose amid controversy involved in placing a 
statue of African American Richmond native and tennis star Arthur Ashe 
to the famed series of statues of Confederate heroes of the Civil War on 
Monument Avenue.[35] After several months of controversy, the bronze statue 
of Ashe was finally completed on Monument Avenue facing the opposite direction 
from the Confederate Heroes on July 10, 1996.[36] A multimillion-dollar 
flood wall was completed in 1995, in order to protect low-lying areas of 
city from the oft-rising waters of the James River. As a result, the River 
District businesses grew rapidly, and today the area is home to much of 
Richmond's entertainment, dining and nightlife activity, bolstered by the 
creation of a Canal Walk along the city's former industrial canals.[37][38] 
Richmond is located at 37°32′N 77°28′W﻿ / ﻿37.533°N 77.467°W﻿ / 37.533; 
-77.467 (37.538, −77.462). According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the city has a total area of 62 square miles (160 km2), of which 60 square 
miles (160 km2) is land and 2.7 square miles (7.0 km2) of it (4.3%) is 
water.[39] The city is located in the Piedmont region of Virginia, at the 
highest navigable point of the James River. The Piedmont region is characterized 
by relatively low, rolling hills, and lies between the low, sea level Tidewater 
region and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Significant bodies of water in the 
region include the James River, the Appomattox River, and the Chickahominy 
River. The Richmond-Petersburg Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), the 
44th largest in the United States, includes the independent cities of Richmond, 
Colonial Heights, Hopewell, and Petersburg, as well as the counties of 
Charles City, Chesterfield, Dinwiddie, Goochland, Hanover, Henrico, New 
Kent, Powhatan, and Prince George.[40] As of July 1, 2009[update], the 
total population of the Richmond—Petersburg MSA was 1,258,251. Richmond's 
original street grid, laid out in 1737, included the area between what 
are now Broad, 17th, and 25th Streets and the James River. Modern Downtown 
Richmond is located slightly farther west, on the slopes of Shockoe Hill. 
Nearby neighborhoods include Shockoe Bottom, the historically significant 
and low-lying area between Shockoe Hill and Church Hill, and Monroe Ward, 
which contains the Jefferson Hotel. Richmond's East End includes neighborhoods 
like rapidly gentrifying Church Hill, home to St. John's Church, as well 
as poorer areas like Fulton, Union Hill, and Fairmont, and public housing 
projects like Mosby Court, Whitcomb Court, Fairfield Court, and Creighton 
Court closer to Interstate 64.[41] The area between Belvidere Street, Interstate 
195, Interstate 95, and the river, which includes Virginia Commonwealth 
University, is socioeconomically and architecturally diverse. North of 
Broad Street, the Carver and Newtowne West neighborhoods are demographically 
similar to neighboring Jackson Ward, with Carver experiencing some gentrification 
due to its proximity to VCU. The affluent area between the Boulevard, Main 
Street, Broad Street, and VCU, known as the Fan, is home to Monument Avenue, 
an outstanding collection of Victorian architecture, and many students. 
West of the Boulevard is the Museum District, the location of the Virginia 
Historical Society and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. South of the Downtown 
Expressway are Byrd Park, Maymont, Hollywood Cemetery, the predominantly 
black working class Randolph neighborhood, and white working class Oregon 
Hill. Cary Street between Interstate 195 and the Boulevard is a popular 
commercial area called Carytown.[41] Richmond's Northside is home to numerous 
listed historic districts.[42] Neighborhoods such as Chestnut Hill-Plateau 
and Barton Heights began to develop at the end of the 19th century when 
the new streetcar system made it possible for people to live on the outskirts 
of town and still commute to jobs downtown. Other prominent Northside neighborhoods 
include Azalea, Barton Heights, Bellevue, Chamberlayne, Ginter Park, Highland 
Park, and Rosedale.[41] Farther west is the affluent, suburban West End. 
Windsor Farms is among its best-known sections. The West End also includes 
middle to lower income neighborhoods, such as Laurel, Farmington and the 
areas surrounding the Regency Mall. More affluent areas include Glen Allen, 
Tuckahoe, and Short Pump, which can all be found north and northwest of 
the city. The University of Richmond and the Country Club of Virginia can 
be found here as well, which are located just inside the City Limits.[41] 
The portion of the city south of the James River is known as the Southside. 
Neighborhoods in the city's Southside area range from affluent and middle 
class suburban neighborhoods Westover Hills, Forest Hill, Southampton, 
Stratford Hills, Oxford, Huguenot Hills, Hobby Hill, and Woodland Heights 
to the impoverished Manchester and Blackwell areas, the Hillside Court 
housing projects, and the ailing Jefferson Davis Highway commercial corridor. 
Other Southside neighborhoods include Fawnbrook, Broad Rock, Cherry Gardens, 
Cullenwood, and Beaufont Hills. Much of Southside developed a suburban 
character as part of Chesterfield County before being annexed by Richmond, 
most notably in 1970.[41] Richmond has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen 
Cfa), with hot and humid summers and generally cool winters. The mountains 
to the west act as a partial barrier to outbreaks of cold, continental 
air in winter; Arctic air is delayed long enough to be modified, then further 
warmed as it subsides in its approach to Richmond. The open waters of the 
Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean contribute to the humid summers and mild 
winters. The coldest weather normally occurs from late December to early 
February, and the January daily mean temperature is 37.9 °F (3.3 °C), with 
an average of 6.0 days with highs at or below the freezing mark.[43] Downtown 
areas straddle the border between USDA Hardiness zones 7B and 8A,[44] and 
temperatures seldom lower to 0 °F (−18 °C), with the most recent subzero 
(°F) reading occurring on January 28, 2000, when the temperature reached 
−1 °F (−18 °C).[45] The July daily mean temperature is 79.3 °F (26.3 °C), 
and high temperatures reach or exceed 90 °F (32 °C) approximately 43 days 
out of the year; while 100 °F (38 °C) temperatures are not uncommon, they 
do not occur every year.[46] Extremes in temperature have ranged from −12 °F 
(−24 °C) on January 19, 1940 up to 107 °F (42 °C) on August 6, 1918.[a] 
Precipitation is rather uniformly distributed throughout the year. However, 
dry periods lasting several weeks do occur, especially in autumn when long 
periods of pleasant, mild weather are most common. There is considerable 
variability in total monthly amounts from year to year so that no one month 
can be depended upon to be normal. Snow has been recorded during seven 
of the twelve months. Falls of 3 inches (7.6 cm) or more within 24 hours 
occur an average once per year.[43] Annual snowfall, however, is usually 
light, averaging 10.5 inches (27 cm) per season.[43] Snow typically remains 
on the ground only one or two days at a time, but remained for 16 days 
in 2010 (January 30 to February 14). Ice storms (freezing rain or glaze) 
are not uncommon, but they are seldom severe enough to do any considerable 
damage. The James River reaches tidewater at Richmond where flooding may 
occur in every month of the year, most frequently in March and least in 
July. Hurricanes and tropical storms have been responsible for most of 
the flooding during the summer and early fall months. Hurricanes passing 
near Richmond have produced record rainfalls. In 1955, three hurricanes 
brought record rainfall to Richmond within a six-week period. The most 
noteworthy of these were Hurricane Connie and Hurricane Diane that brought 
heavy rains five days apart. And in 2004, the downtown area suffered extensive 
flood damage after the remnants of Hurricane Gaston dumped up to 12 inches 
(300 mm) of rainfall.[48] Damaging storms occur mainly from snow and freezing 
rain in winter and from hurricanes, tornadoes, and severe thunderstorms 
in other seasons. Damage may be from wind, flooding, or rain, or from any 
combination of these. Tornadoes are infrequent but some notable occurrences 
have been observed within the Richmond area. Based on the 1981–2010 period, 
the average first occurrence of at or below freezing temperatures in the 
fall is November 4 and the average last occurrence in the spring is April 
5.[45] As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 204,214 people residing 
in the city. 50.6% were Black or African American, 40.8% White, 5.0% Asian, 
0.3% Native American, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.6% of some other race and 
2.3% of two or more races. 6.3% were Hispanic or Latino (of any race). 
As of the census[56] of 2000, there were 197,790 people, 84,549 households, 
and 43,627 families residing in the city. The population density was 3,292.6 
people per square mile (1,271.3/km²). There were 92,282 housing units at 
an average density of 1,536.2 per square mile (593.1/km²). The racial makeup 
of the city was 38.3% White, 57.2% African American, 0.2% Native American, 
1.3% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 1.5% from other races, and 1.5% from 
two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.6% of the population. 
There were 84,549 households out of which 23.1% had children under the 
age of 18 living with them, 27.1% were married couples living together, 
20.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.4% were 
non-families. 37.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.9% 
had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average 
household size was 2.21 and the average family size was 2.95. In the city 
the age distribution of the population shows 21.8% under the age of 18, 
13.1% from 18 to 24, 31.7% from 25 to 44, 20.1% from 45 to 64, and 13.2% 
who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 
100 females there were 87.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, 
there were 83.5 males. The median income for a household in the city was 
$31,121, and the median income for a family was $38,348. Males had a median 
income of $30,874 versus $25,880 for females. The per capita income for 
the city was $20,337. About 17.1% of families and 21.4% of the population 
were below the poverty line, including 32.9% of those under age 18 and 
15.8% of those age 65 or over. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Richmond 
experienced a spike in overall crime, in particular, the city's murder 
rate. The city had 93 murders for the year of 1985, with a murder rate 
of 41.9 killings committed per 100,000 residents. Over the next decade, 
the city saw a major increase in total homicides. In 1990 there were 114 
murders, for a murder rate of 56.1 killings per 100,000 residents. There 
were 120 murders in 1995, resulting in a murder rate of 59.1 killings per 
100,000 residents, one of the highest in the United States.[57] In 2004, 
Morgan Quitno Press ranked Richmond as the ninth (out of 354) most dangerous 
city in the United States.[58] In 2005, Richmond was ranked as the fifth 
most dangerous city overall and the 12th most dangerous metropolitan area 
in the United States.[59][60][61] The following year, Richmond saw a decline 
in crime, ranking as the 15th most dangerous city in the United States. 
By 2008, Richmond's position on the list had fallen to 49th.[62] By 2012, 
Richmond was no longer in the 'top' 200.[63] Richmond's rate of major crime, 
including violent and property crimes, decreased 47 percent between 2004 
and 2009 to its lowest level in more than a quarter of a century.[64] Various 
forms of crime tend to be declining, yet remaining above state and national 
averages.[65] In 2008, the city had recorded the lowest homicide rate since 
1971.[66] FBI Uniform Crime Reports for Richmond for the year of 2013:[67] 
In 1786, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, penned in 1779 by 
Thomas Jefferson, was adopted by the Virginia General Assembly in Richmond. 
The site is now commemorated by the First Freedom Center. Richmond has 
several historic churches. Because of its early English colonial history 
from the early 17th century to 1776, Richmond has a number of prominent 
Anglican/Episcopal churches including Monumental Church, St. Paul's Episcopal 
Church and St. John's Episcopal Church. Methodists and Baptists made up 
another section of early churches, and First Baptist Church of Richmond 
was the first of these, established in 1780. In the Reformed church tradition, 
the first Presbyterian Church in the City of Richmond was First Presbyterian 
Church, organized on June 18, 1812. On February 5, 1845, Second Presbyterian 
Church of Richmond was founded, which was a historic church where Stonewall 
Jackson attended and was the first Gothic building and the first gas-lit 
church to be built in Richmond.[68] St. Peter's Church was dedicated and 
became the first Catholic church in Richmond on May 25, 1834.[69] The city 
is also home to the historic Cathedral of the Sacred Heart which is the 
motherchurch for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond.[70] The first 
Jewish congregation in Richmond was Kahal Kadosh Beth Shalom. Kahal Kadosh 
Beth Shalom was the sixth congregation in the United States. By 1822 K.K. 
Beth Shalom members worshipped in the first synagogue building in Virginia. 
They eventually merged with Congregation Beth Ahabah, an offshoot of Beth 
Shalom. There are two Orthodox Synagogues, Keneseth Beth Israel and Chabad 
of Virginia.[71] There is an Orthodox Yeshivah K–12 school system known 
as Rudlin Torah academy, which also includes a post high-school program. 
There are two Conservative synagogues, Beth El and Or Atid. There are three 
Reform synagogues, Bonay Kodesh,[72] Beth Ahabah and Or Ami. Along with 
such religious congregations, there are a variety of other Jewish charitable, 
educational and social service institutions, each serving the Jewish and 
general communities. These include the Weinstein Jewish Community Center, 
Jewish Family Services, Jewish Community Federation of Richmond and Richmond 
Jewish Foundation. Due to the influx of German immigrants in the 1840s, 
St. John's German Evangelical church was formed in 1843. Saints Constantine 
and Helen Greek Orthodox Cathedral held its first worship service in a 
rented room at 309 North 7th Street in 1917. The cathedral relocated to 
30 Malvern Avenue in 1960 and is noted as one of two Eastern Orthodox churches 
in Richmond and home to the annual Richmond Greek Festival.[73] There are 
seven current masjids in the Greater Richmond area, with three more currently 
in construction,[74][75][76] accommodating the growing Muslim population, 
the first one being Masjid Bilal.[77][78] In the 1950s, Muslims from the 
East End got organized under Nation of Islam (NOI). They used to meet in 
Temple #24 located on North Avenue. After the NOI split in 1975, the Muslims 
who joined mainstream Islam, start meeting at Shabaaz Restaurant on Nine 
Mile Road. By 1976, the Muslims used to meet in a rented church. They tried 
to buy this church, but due to financial difficulties the Muslims instead 
bought an old grocery store at Chimbarazoo Boulevard, the present location 
of Masjid Bilal. Initially, the place was called "Masjid Muhammad #24". 
Only by 1990 did the Muslims renamed it to "Masjid Bilal". Masjid Bilal 
was followed by the Islamic Center of Virginia, ICVA[79] masjid. The ICVA 
was established in 1973 as a non profit tax exempt organization. With aggressive 
fundraising, ICVA was able to buy land on Buford road. Construction of 
the new masjid began in the early 1980s. The rest of the five current masjids 
in the Richmond area are Islamic Center of Richmond (ICR)[80] in the west 
end, Masjid Umm Barakah[81] on 2nd street downtown, Islamic Society of 
Greater Richmond (ISGR)[82] in the west end, Masjidullah[83] in the north 
side, and Masjid Ar-Rahman[84] in the east end. Hinduism is actively practiced, 
particularly in suburban areas of Henrico and Chesterfield. Some 6,000 
families of Indian descent resided in the Richmond Region as of 2011. Hindus 
are served by several temples and cultural centers. The two most familiar 
are the Cultural Center of India (CCI) located off of Iron Bridge Road 
in Chesterfield County and the Hindu Center of Virginia in Henrico County 
which has garnered national fame and awards for being the first LEED certified 
religious facility in the commonwealth. Seminaries in Richmond include: 
the school of theology at Virginia Union University; a Presbyterian seminary, 
Union Presbyterian Seminary, and the Baptist Theological Seminary at Richmond. 
The McCollough Theological Seminary of the United House of Prayer For All 
People is located in the Church Hill neighborhood of the city. Bishops 
that sit in Richmond include those of the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia 
(the denomination's largest); the Richmond Area of the United Methodist 
Church (Virginia Annual Conference), the nation's second-largest and one 
of the oldest. The Presbytery of the James—Presbyterian Church (USA) – 
also is based in the Richmond area. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond 
was canonically erected by Pope Pius VII on July 11, 1820. Today there 
are 235,816 Catholics at 146 parishes in the Diocese of Richmond.[85] The 
city of Richmond is home to 19 Catholic parishes.[86] Cathedral of the 
Sacred Heart is home to the current bishop Most Reverend Francis Xavier 
DiLorenzo who was appointed by Pope John Paul II on March 31, 2004. Richmond's 
strategic location on the James River, built on undulating hills at the 
rocky fall line separating the Piedmont and Tidewater regions of Virginia, 
provided a natural nexus for the development of commerce. Throughout these 
three centuries and three modes of transportation, the downtown has always 
been a hub, with the Great Turning Basin for boats, the world's only triple 
crossing of rail lines, and the intersection of two major interstates. 
Law and finance have long been driving forces in the economy.[87] The city 
is home to both the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, 
one of 13 United States courts of appeals, and the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Richmond, one of 12 Federal Reserve Banks, as well as offices for international 
companies such as Genworth Financial, CapitalOne, Philip Morris USA, and 
numerous other banks and brokerages. Richmond is also home to four of the 
largest law firms in the United States: Hunton & Williams, McGuireWoods, 
Williams Mullen, and LeClairRyan. Another law firm with a major Richmond 
presence is Troutman Sanders, which merged with Richmond-based Mays & Valentine 
LLP in 2001. Since the 1960s Richmond has been a prominent hub for advertising 
agencies and advertising related businesses, including The Martin Agency, 
named 2009 U.S. Agency of the Year by AdWeek. As a result of local advertising 
agency support, VCU's graduate advertising school (VCU Brandcenter) is 
consistently ranked the No. 1 advertising graduate program in the country.[88] 
Richmond is home to the rapidly developing Virginia BioTechnology Research 
Park,[89] which opened in 1995 as an incubator facility for biotechnology 
and pharmaceutical companies. Located adjacent to the Medical College of 
Virginia (MCV) Campus of Virginia Commonwealth University, the park currently[when?] 
has more than 575,000 square feet (53,400 m2) of research, laboratory and 
office space for a diverse tenant mix of companies, research institutes, 
government laboratories and non-profit organizations. The United Network 
for Organ Sharing, which maintains the nation's organ transplant waiting 
list, occupies one building in the park. Philip Morris USA opened a $350 
million research and development facility in the park in 2007. Once fully 
developed, park officials expect the site to employ roughly 3,000 scientists, 
technicians and engineers. Richmond's revitalized downtown includes the 
Canal Walk, a new Greater Richmond Convention Center, and expansion on 
both VCU campuses. A new performing arts center, Richmond CenterStage,[90] 
opened on September 12, 2009.[91] The complex included a renovation of 
the Carpenter Center and construction of a new multipurpose hall, community 
playhouse, and arts education center in parts of the old Thalhimers department 
store.[92] Richmond is also fast-becoming known for its food scene, with 
several restaurants in the Fan, Church Hill, Jackson Ward and elsewhere 
around the city generating regional and national attention for their fare. 
Departures magazine named Richmond "The Next Great American Food City" 
in August 2014.[93][94] Also in 2014, Southern Living magazine named three 
Richmond restaurants – Comfort, Heritage and The Roosevelt – among its 
"100 Best Restaurants in the South",[95] while Metzger Bar & Butchery made 
its "Best New Restaurants: 12 To Watch" list.[96] Craft beer and liquor 
production is also growing in the River City, with twelve micro-breweries 
in city proper; the oldest is Legend Brewery, founded in 1994. Three distilleries, 
Reservoir Distillery, Belle Isle Craft Spirits and James River Distillery, 
were established in 2010, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, Richmond 
is gaining attention from the film and television industry, with several 
high-profile films shot in the metro region in the past few years, including 
the major motion picture Lincoln which led to Daniel Day-Lewis's third 
Oscar, Killing Kennedy with Rob Lowe, airing on the National Geographic 
Channel and Turn, starring Jamie Bell and airing on AMC. In 2015 Richmond 
will be the main filming location for the upcoming PBS drama series Mercy 
Street, which will premiere in Winter 2016. Several organizations, including 
the Virginia Film Office and the Virginia Production Alliance, along with 
events like the Richmond International Film Festival and French Film Festival, 
continue to put draw supporters of film and media to the region. The Greater 
Richmond area was named the third-best city for business by MarketWatch 
in September 2007, ranking behind only the Minneapolis and Denver areas 
and just above Boston. The area is home to six Fortune 500 companies: electric 
utility Dominion Resources; CarMax; Owens & Minor; Genworth Financial; 
WestRock; McKesson Medical-Surgical, Markel Corporation, and Altria Group.[8] 
However, only Dominion Resources and MeadWestvaco are headquartered within 
the city of Richmond; the others are located in the neighboring counties 
of Henrico and Hanover. In 2008, Altria moved its corporate HQ from New 
York City to Henrico County, adding another Fortune 500 corporation to 
Richmond's list. In February 2006, MeadWestvaco announced that they would 
move from Stamford, Connecticut, to Richmond in 2008 with the help of the 
Greater Richmond Partnership,[97] a regional economic development organization 
that also helped locate Aditya Birla Minacs,[98] Amazon.com,[99] and Honeywell 
International,[100] to the region. Other Fortune 500 companies, while not 
headquartered in the area, do have a major presence. These include SunTrust 
Bank (based in Atlanta), Capital One Financial Corporation (officially 
based in McLean, Virginia, but founded in Richmond with its operations 
center and most employees in the Richmond area), and the medical and pharmaceutical 
giant McKesson (based in San Francisco). Capital One and Altria company's 
Philip Morris USA are two of the largest private Richmond-area employers. 
DuPont maintains a production facility in South Richmond known as the Spruance 
Plant. UPS Freight, the less-than-truckload division of UPS and formerly 
known as Overnite Transportation, has its corporate headquarters in Richmond. 
Other companies based in Richmond include chemical company NewMarket; Brink's, 
a security and armored car company; Estes Express Lines, a freight carrier, 
Universal Corporation, a tobacco merchant; Cavalier Telephone, now Windstream, 
a telephone, internet, and digital television provider formed in Richmond 
in 1998; Cherry Bekaert & Holland, a top 30 accounting firm serving the 
Southeast; the law firm of McGuireWoods; and Media General, a company specializing 
in broadcast media. Several of the city's large general museums are located 
near the Boulevard. On Boulevard proper are the Virginia Historical Society 
and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, lending their name to what is sometimes 
called the Museum District. Nearby on Broad Street is the Science Museum 
of Virginia, housed in the neoclassical former 1919 Broad Street Union 
Station. Immediately adjacent is the Children's Museum of Richmond, and 
two blocks away, the Virginia Center for Architecture. Within the downtown 
are the Library of Virginia and the Valentine Richmond History Center. 
Elsewhere are the Virginia Holocaust Museum and the Old Dominion Railway 
Museum. As the primary former Capital of the Confederate States of America, 
Richmond is home to many museums and battlefields of the American Civil 
War. Near the riverfront is the Richmond National Battlefield Park Visitors 
Center and the American Civil War Center at Historic Tredegar, both housed 
in the former buildings of the Tredegar Iron Works, where much of the ordnance 
for the war was produced. In Court End, near the Virginia State Capitol, 
is the Museum of the Confederacy, along with the Davis Mansion, also known 
as the White House of the Confederacy; both feature a wide variety of objects 
and material from the era. The temporary home of former Confederate General 
Robert E. Lee still stands on Franklin Street in downtown Richmond. The 
history of slavery and emancipation are also increasingly represented: 
there is a former slave trail along the river that leads to Ancarrow's 
Boat Ramp and Historic Site which has been developed with interpretive 
signage, and in 2007, the Reconciliation Statue was placed in Shockoe Bottom, 
with parallel statues placed in Liverpool and Benin representing points 
of the Triangle Trade. Other historical points of interest include St. 
John's Church, the site of Patrick Henry's famous "Give me liberty or give 
me death" speech, and the Edgar Allan Poe Museum, features many of his 
writings and other artifacts of his life, particularly when he lived in 
the city as a child, a student, and a successful writer. The John Marshall 
House, the home of the former Chief Justice of the United States, is also 
located downtown and features many of his writings and objects from his 
life. Hollywood Cemetery is the burial grounds of two U.S. Presidents as 
well as many Civil War officers and soldiers. The city is home to many 
monuments and memorials, most notably those along Monument Avenue. Other 
monuments include the A.P. Hill monument, the Bill "Bojangles" Robinson 
monument in Jackson Ward, the Christopher Columbus monument near Byrd Park, 
and the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument on Libby Hill. Located 
near Byrd Park is the famous World War I Memorial Carillon, a 56-bell carillon 
tower. Dedicated in 1956, the Virginia War Memorial is located on Belvedere 
overlooking the river, and is a monument to Virginians who died in battle 
in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the War 
in Afghanistan, and the Iraq War. Agecroft Hall is a Tudor manor house 
and estate located on the James River in the Windsor Farms neighborhood 
of Richmond. The manor house was built in the late 15th century, and was 
originally located in the Agecroft area of Pendlebury, in the historic 
county of Lancashire in England. Richmond has a significant arts community, 
some of which is contained in formal public-supported venues, and some 
of which is more DIY, such as local privately owned galleries, and private 
music venues, nonprofit arts organizations, or organic and venueless arts 
movements (e.g., house shows, busking, itinerant folk shows). This has 
led to tensions, as the city Richmond City levied an "admissions tax" to 
fund large arts projects like CentreStage, leading to criticism that it 
is funding civic initiatives on the backs of the organic local culture.[101] 
Traditional Virginian folk music, including blues, country, and bluegrass 
are also notably present, and play a large part in the annual Richmond 
Folk Festival. The following is a list of the more formal arts establishments 
(Companies, theaters, galleries, and other large venues) in Richmond: As 
of 2015 a variety of murals from internationally recognized street artists 
have appeared throughout the city as a result of the efforts of Art Whino 
and RVA Magazine with The Richmond Mural Project and the RVA Street Art 
Festival.[102] Artists who have produced work in the city as a result of 
these festivals include ROA, Pixel Pancho, Gaia, Aryz, Alexis Diaz, Ever 
Siempre, Jaz, 2501, Natalia Rak, Pose MSK, Vizie, Jeff Soto, Mark Jenkins, 
Etam Cru- and local artists Hamilton Glass, Nils Westergard, El Kamino, 
Nico Cathcart,[103] and Ed Trask. Both festivals are expected to continue 
this year with artists such as Ron English slated to produce work.[104] 
From earliest days, Virginia, and Richmond in particular, have welcomed 
live theatrical performances. From Lewis Hallam's early productions of 
Shakespeare in Williamsburg, the focus shifted to Richmond's antebellum 
prominence as a main colonial and early 19th century performance venue 
for such celebrated American and English actors as William Macready, Edwin 
Forrest,[105] and the Booth family. In the 20th century, Richmonders' love 
of theater continued with many amateur troupes and regular touring professional 
productions. In the 1960s a small renaissance or golden age accompanied 
the growth of professional dinner theaters and the fostering of theater 
by the Virginia Museum, reaching a peak in the 1970s with the establishment 
of a resident Equity company at the Virginia Museum Theater (now the Leslie 
Cheek) and the birth of Theatre IV, a company that continues to this day 
under the name Virginia Repertory Theatre. Other venues and companies include: 
Commercial art galleries include Metro Space Gallery and Gallery 5 in a 
newly designated arts district. Not-for-profit galleries include Visual 
Arts Center of Richmond, 1708 Gallery and Artspace. In addition, in 2008, 
a new 47,000-square-foot (4,400 m2) Gay Community Center opened on the 
city's north side, which hosts meetings of many kinds, and includes a large 
art gallery space. Richmond has long been a hub for literature and writers, 
not limited to those identified with the South. Edgar Allan Poe was a child 
in the city, and the town's oldest stone house is now a museum to his life 
and works.[113] The Southern Literary Messenger, which included his writing, 
is just one of many notable publications that began in Richmond. Other 
noteworthy authors who have called Richmond home include Pulitzer-winning 
Ellen Glasgow, controversial figure James Branch Cabell, Meg Medina, Dean 
King, David L. Robbins, and MacArthur Fellow Paule Marshall. Tom Wolfe 
was born in Richmond, as was Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan. David 
Baldacci graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University, where the creative 
writing faculty has included Marshall, Claudia Emerson, Kathleen Graber, 
T. R. Hummer, Dave Smith, David Wojahn, Susann Cokal, Thomas De Haven, 
and Larry Levis. Notable graduates include Sheri Reynolds, Jon Pineda, 
Anna Journey, and Joshua Poteat. [114] A community-based organization called 
James River Writers serves the greater Richmond area; it sponsors many 
programs for writers at all stages of their careers and puts on an annual 
writers' conference that draws attendees from miles away.[114] Richmond 
is home to many significant structures, including some designed by notable 
architects. The city contains diverse styles, including significant examples 
of Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, Neoclassical, Egyptian Revival, Romanesque 
Revival, Gothic Revival, Tudor Revival, Italianate, Queen Anne, Colonial 
Revival, Art Deco, Modernist, International, and Postmodern buildings. 
Much of Richmond's early architecture was destroyed by the Evacuation Fire 
in 1865. It is estimated that 25% of all buildings in Richmond were destroyed 
during this fire.[115] Even fewer now remain due to construction and demolition 
that has taken place since Reconstruction. In spite of this, Richmond contains 
many historically significant buildings and districts. Buildings remain 
from Richmond's colonial period, such as the Patteson-Schutte House and 
the Edgar Allan Poe Museum (Richmond, Virginia), both built before 1750. 
Architectural classicism is heavily represented in all districts of the 
city, particularly in Downtown, the Fan, and the Museum District. Several 
notable classical architects have designed buildings in Richmond. The Virginia 
State Capitol was designed by Thomas Jefferson and Charles-Louis Clérisseau 
in 1785. It is the second-oldest US statehouse in continuous use (after 
Maryland's) and was the first US government building built in the neo-classical 
style of architecture, setting the trend for other state houses and the 
federal government buildings (including the White House and The Capitol) 
in Washington, D.C.[116] Robert Mills designed Monumental Church on Broad 
Street. Adjoining it is the 1845 Egyptian Building, one of the few Egyptian 
Revival buildings in the United States. The firm of John Russell Pope designed 
Broad Street Station as well as Branch House on Monument Avenue, designed 
as a private residence in the Tudor style, now serving as the Branch Museum 
of Architecture and Design. Broad Street Station (or Union Station), designed 
in the Beaux-Arts style, is no longer a functioning station but is now 
home to the Science Museum of Virginia. Main Street Station, designed by 
Wilson, Harris, and Richards, has been returned to use in its original 
purpose. The Jefferson Hotel and the Commonwealth Club were both designed 
by the classically trained Beaux-Arts architects Carrère and Hastings. 
Many buildings on the University of Richmond campus, including Jeter Hall 
and Ryland Hall, were designed by Ralph Adams Cram, most famous for his 
Princeton University Chapel and the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine. 
Richmond's urban residential neighborhoods also hold particular significance 
to the city's fabric. The Fan, the Museum District, Jackson Ward, Carver, 
Carytown, Oregon Hill and Church Hill (among others) are largely single 
use town homes and mixed use or full retail/dining establishments. These 
districts are anchored by large streets such as Franklin Street, Cary Street, 
the Boulevard, and Monument Avenue. The city's growth in population over 
the last decade has been concentrated in these areas. Among Richmond's 
most interesting architectural features is its Cast-iron architecture. 
Second only to New Orleans in its concentration of cast iron work, the 
city is home to a unique collection of cast iron porches, balconies, fences, 
and finials. Richmond's position as a center of iron production helped 
to fuel its popularity within the city. At the height of production in 
the 1890, 25 foundries operated in the city employing nearly 3,500 metal 
workers. This number is seven times the number of general construction 
workers being employed in Richmond at the time which illustrates the importance 
of its iron exports.[117] Porches and fences in urban neighborhoods such 
as Jackson Ward, Church Hill, and Monroe Ward are particularly elaborate, 
often featuring ornate iron casts never replicated outside of Richmond. 
In some cases cast were made for a single residential or commercial application. 
Richmond is home to several notable instances of various styles of modernism. 
Minoru Yamasaki designed the Federal Reserve Building which dominates the 
downtown skyline. The architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill 
has designed two buildings: the Library of Virginia and the General Assembly 
Offices at the Eighth and Main Building. Philip Johnson designed the WRVA 
Building. The Richard Neutra-designed Rice House, a residence on a private 
island on the James River, remains Richmond's only true International Style 
home. The W.G. Harris residence in Richmond was designed by famed early 
modern architect and member of the Harvard Five,[118] Landis Gores. Other 
notable architects to have worked in the city include Rick Mather, I.M. 
Pei, and Gordon Bunshaft. VCU is currently raising funds for a new Institute 
of Contemporary Arts designed by Steven Holl. The ICA is to be funded by 
private donors and will hopefully be opened by 2015. Richmond's City Code 
provides for the creation of old and historic districts so as to "recognize 
and protect the historic, architectural, cultural, and artistic heritage 
of the City."[119] Pursuant to that authority, the city has designated 
45 districts throughout the city.[120] The majority of these districts 
are also listed in the Virginia Landmarks Register ("VLR") and the National 
Register of Historic Places ("NRHP"). Fifteen of the districts represent 
broad sections of the city:[121] The remaining thirty districts are limited 
to an individual building or group of buildings throughout the city: In 
addition to featuring typical cuisine of the Southern United States such 
as barbecue, pimento cheese, and ham biscuits, Richmond has been recognized 
in recent years for being a "foodie city".[123][124][125] The city also 
claims the invention of the sailor sandwich, which includes pastrami, knockwurst, 
Swiss cheese and mustard on rye bread.[126] Richmond is also where, in 
1935, canned beer was made commercially available for the first time.[127] 
The city operates one of the oldest municipal park systems in the country. 
The park system began when the city council voted in 1851 to acquire 7.5 
acres (30,000 m2), now known as Monroe Park. Today, Monroe Park sits adjacent 
to the Virginia Commonwealth University campus and is one of more than 
40 parks comprising a total of more than 1,500 acres (610 ha). Several 
parks are located along the James River, and the James River Parks System 
offers bike trails, hiking and nature trails, and many scenic overlooks 
along the river's route through the city. The trails are used as part of 
the Xterra East Championship course for both the running and mountain biking 
portions of the off-road triathlon. [128] There are also parks on two major 
islands in the river: Belle Isle and Brown's Island. Belle Isle, at various 
former times a Powhatan fishing village, colonial-era horse race track, 
and Civil War prison camp, is the larger of the two, and contains many 
bike trails as well as a small cliff that is used for rock climbing instruction. 
One can walk the island and still see many of the remains of the Civil 
War prison camp, such as an arms storage room and a gun emplacement that 
was used to quell prisoner riots. Brown's Island is a smaller island and 
a popular venue of a large number of free outdoor concerts and festivals 
in the spring and summer, such as the weekly Friday Cheers concert series 
or the James River Beer and Seafood Festival. Two other major parks in 
the city along the river are Byrd Park and Maymont, located near the Fan 
District. Byrd Park features a one-mile (1.6 km) running track, with exercise 
stops, a public dog park, and a number of small lakes for small boats, 
as well as two monuments, Buddha house, and an amphitheatre. Prominently 
featured in the park is the World War I Memorial Carillon, built in 1926 
as a memorial to those that died in the war. Maymont, located adjacent 
to Byrd Park, is a 100-acre (40 ha) Victorian estate with a museum, formal 
gardens, native wildlife exhibits, nature center, carriage collection, 
and children's farm. Other parks in the city include Joseph Bryan Park 
Azalea Garden, Forest Hill Park (former site of the Forest Hill Amusement 
Park), Chimborazo Park (site of the National Battlefield Headquarters), 
among others. The James River itself through Richmond is renowned as one 
of the best in the country for urban white-water rafting/canoeing/kayaking. 
Several rafting companies offer complete services. There are also several 
easily accessed riverside areas within the city limits for rock-hopping, 
swimming, and picnicking. Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden is located adjacent 
to the city in Henrico County. Founded in 1984, Lewis Ginter Botanical 
Garden is located on 80 acres (320,000 m2) and features a glass conservatory, 
a rose garden, a healing garden, and an accessible-to-all children's garden. 
The Garden is a public place for the display and scientific study of plants. 
Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden is one of only two independent public botanical 
gardens in Virginia and is designated a state botanical garden.[129] Several 
theme parks are also located near the city, including Kings Dominion to 
the north, and Busch Gardens to the east, near Williamsburg. Richmond is 
not home to any major league professional sports teams, but since 2013, 
the Washington Redskins of the National Football League have held their 
summer training camp in the city.[130] There are also several minor league 
sports in the city, including the Richmond Kickers of the United Soccer 
League (third tier of American soccer) and the Richmond Flying Squirrels 
of the Class AA Eastern League of Minor League Baseball (an affiliate of 
the San Francisco Giants).[131][132] The Kickers began playing in Richmond 
in 1993, and currently play at City Stadium. The Squirrels opened their 
first season at The Diamond on April 15, 2010.[133] From 1966 through 2008, 
the city was home to the Richmond Braves, a AAA affiliate of the Atlanta 
Braves of Major League Baseball, until the franchise relocated to Georgia.[134] 
It is also the home to the Richmond Black Widows, the city's first women's 
football team, founded in 2015 by Sarah Schkeeper. They are a part of the 
Women's Football Alliance. Their game season begins in April, with preseason 
beginning in January. Another significant sports venue is the 6,000-seat 
Arthur Ashe Athletic Center, a multi-purpose arena named for tennis great 
and Richmond resident Arthur Ashe. This facility hosts a variety of local 
sporting events, concerts, and other activities. As the home of Arthur 
Ashe, the sport of tennis is also popular in Richmond, and in 2010, the 
United States Tennis Association named Richmond as the third "Best Tennis 
Town", behind Charleston, South Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia.[135] Auto 
racing is also popular in the area. The Richmond International Raceway 
(RIR) has hosted NASCAR Sprint Cup races since 1953, as well as the Capital 
City 400 from 1962 − 1980.[136] RIR also hosted IndyCar's Suntrust Indy 
Challenge from 2001 − 2009. Another track, Southside Speedway, has operated 
since 1959 and sits just southwest of Richmond in Chesterfield County. 
This .333-mile (0.536 km) oval short-track has become known as the "Toughest 
Track in the South" and "The Action Track", and features weekly stock car 
racing on Friday nights.[137] Southside Speedway has acted as the breeding 
grounds for many past NASCAR legends including Richard Petty, Bobby Allison 
and Darrell Waltrip, and claims to be the home track of NASCAR superstar 
Denny Hamlin.[138][139] In 2015, Richmond hosted the 2015 UCI Road World 
Championships, which had cyclists from 76 countries and an economic impact 
on the Greater Richmond Region estimated to be $158.1 million, from both 
event staging and visitor spending.[140] College basketball has also had 
recent success with the Richmond Spiders and the VCU Rams, both of the 
Atlantic 10 Conference. The Spiders' men's and women's teams play at Robins 
Center and the Rams' men's and women's teams play at the Stuart C. Siegel 
Center. The Richmond Times-Dispatch, the local daily newspaper in Richmond 
with a Sunday circulation of 120,000, is owned by BH Media, a subsidiary 
of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway company. Style Weekly is a standard 
weekly publication covering popular culture, arts, and entertainment, owned 
by Landmark Communications. RVA Magazine is the city's only independent 
art music and culture publication, was once monthly, but is now issued 
quarterly. The Richmond Free Press and the Voice cover the news from an 
African-American perspective. The Richmond metro area is served by many 
local television and radio stations. As of 2010[update], the Richmond-Petersburg 
designated market area (DMA) is the 58th largest in the U.S. with 553,950 
homes according to Nielsen Market Research.[141] The major network television 
affiliates are WTVR-TV 6 (CBS), WRIC-TV 8 (ABC), WWBT 12 (NBC), WRLH-TV 
35 (Fox), and WUPV 65 (CW). Public Broadcasting Service stations include 
WCVE-TV 23 and WCVW 57. There are also a wide variety of radio stations 
in the Richmond area, catering to many different interests, including news, 
talk radio, and sports, as well as an eclectic mix of musical interests. 
Richmond city government consists of a city council with representatives 
from nine districts serving in a legislative and oversight capacity, as 
well as a popularly elected, at-large mayor serving as head of the executive 
branch. Citizens in each of the nine districts elect one council representative 
each to serve a four-year term. Beginning with the November 2008 election 
Council terms was lengthened to 4 years. The city council elects from among 
its members one member to serve as Council President and one to serve as 
Council Vice President. The city council meets at City Hall, located at 
900 E. Broad St., 2nd Floor, on the second and fourth Mondays of every 
month, except August. In 1977, a federal district court ruled in favor 
of Curtis Holt Jr. who had claimed the council's existing election process — 
an at large voting system — was racially biased. The verdict required the 
city to rebuild its council into nine distinct wards. Within the year the 
city council switched from majority white to majority black, reflecting 
the city's populace. This new city council elected Richmond's first black 
mayor, Henry L. Marsh. In 1990 religion and politics intersected to impact 
the outcome of the Eighth District election in South Richmond. With the 
endorsements of black power brokers, black clergy and the Richmond Crusade 
for Voters, South Richmond residents made history, electing Reverend A. 
Carl Prince to the Richmond City Council. As the first African American 
Baptist Minister elected to the Richmond City Council, Prince's election 
paved the way for a political paradigm shift in politics that persist today. 
Following Prince's election, Reverend Gwendolyn Hedgepeth and the Reverend 
Leonidas Young, former Richmond Mayor were elected to public office. Prior 
to Prince's election black clergy made political endorsements and served 
as appointees to the Richmond School Board and other boards throughout 
the city. Today religion and politics continues to thrive in the Commonwealth 
of Virginia. The Honorable Dwight C. Jones, a prominent Baptist pastor 
and former Chairman of the Richmond School Board and Member of the Virginia 
House of Delegates serves as Mayor of the City of Richmond. Richmond's 
government changed in 2004 from a council-manager form of government to 
an at-large, popularly elected Mayor. In a landslide election, incumbent 
mayor Rudy McCollum was defeated by L. Douglas Wilder, who previously served 
Virginia as the first elected African American governor in the United States 
since Reconstruction. The current mayor of Richmond is Dwight Clinton Jones, 
who was elected in 2008 and re-elected in 2012. The mayor is not a part 
of the Richmond City Council. As of 2015[update], the Richmond City Council 
consisted of: The city of Richmond operates 28 elementary schools, nine 
middle schools, and eight high schools, serving a total student population 
of 24,000 students.[143] There is one Governor's School in the city − the 
Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies. 
In 2008, it was named as one of Newsweek magazine's 18 "public elite" high 
schools,[144] and in 2012, it was rated #16 of America's best high schools 
overall.[145] Richmond's public school district also runs one of Virginia's 
four public charter schools, the Patrick Henry School of Science and Arts, 
which was founded in 2010.[146] As of 2008, there were 36 private schools 
serving grades one or higher in the city of Richmond.[147] Some of these 
schools include: Benedictine High School, St. Bridget School, Brook Road 
Academy, Collegiate School, St. Christopher's School, St. Gertrude High 
School, St. Catherine's School, Southside Baptist Christian School, Northstar 
Academy, The Steward School, Trinity Episcopal School, and Veritas School. 
The Richmond area has many major institutions of higher education, including 
Virginia Commonwealth University (public), University of Richmond (private), 
Virginia Union University (private), Virginia College (private), South 
University - Richmond (private, for-profit),[148] Union Theological Seminary 
& Presbyterian School of Christian Education (private), and the Baptist 
Theological Seminary in Richmond (BTSR—private). Several community colleges 
are found in the metro area, including J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College 
and John Tyler Community College (Chesterfield County). In addition, there 
are several Technical Colleges in Richmond including ITT Technical Institute, 
ECPI College of Technology and Centura College. There are several vocational 
colleges also, such as Fortis College and Bryant Stratton College. Virginia 
State University is located about 20 miles (32 km) south of Richmond, in 
the suburb of Ettrick, just outside Petersburg. Randolph-Macon College 
is located about 15 miles (24 km) north of Richmond, in the incorporated 
town of Ashland. The Greater Richmond area is served by the Richmond International 
Airport (IATA: RIC, ICAO: KRIC), located in nearby Sandston, seven miles 
(11 km) southeast of Richmond and within an hour drive of historic Williamsburg, 
Virginia. Richmond International is now served by nine airlines with over 
200 daily flights providing non-stop service to major destination markets 
and connecting flights to destinations worldwide. A record 3.3 million 
passengers used Richmond International Airport in 2006, a 13% increase 
over 2005. Richmond is a major hub for intercity bus company Greyhound 
Lines, with its terminal at 2910 N Boulevard. Multiple runs per day connect 
directly with Washington, D.C., New York, Raleigh, and elsewhere. Direct 
trips to New York take approximately 7.5 hours. Discount carrier Megabus 
also provides curbside service from outside of Main Street Station, with 
fares starting at $1. Direct service is available to Washington, D.C., 
Hampton Roads, Charlotte, Raleigh, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. Most other 
connections to Megabus served cites, such as New York, can be made from 
Washington, D.C.[149] Richmond, and the surrounding metropolitan area, 
was granted a roughly $25 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation 
in 2014[150] to support a newly proposed Rapid Transit System, which would 
run along Broad Street from Willow Lawn to Rocketts Landing, in the first 
phase of an improved public transportation hub for the region. Local transit 
and paratransit bus service in Richmond, Henrico, and Chesterfield counties 
is provided by the Greater Richmond Transit Company (GRTC). The GRTC, however, 
serves only small parts of the suburban counties. The far West End (Innsbrook 
and Short Pump) and almost all of Chesterfield County have no public transportation 
despite dense housing, retail, and office development. According to a 2008 
GRTC operations analysis report, a majority of GRTC riders utilize their 
services because they do not have an available alternative such as a private 
vehicle.[151] The Richmond area also has two railroad stations served by 
Amtrak. Each station receives regular service from north of Richmond including 
Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York. The suburban Staples Mill 
Road Station is located on a major north-south freight line and receives 
all service to and from all points south including, Raleigh, Durham, Savannah, 
Newport News, Williamsburg and Florida. Richmond's only railway station 
located within the city limits, the historic Main Street Station, was renovated 
in 2004.[152] As of 2010, the station only receives trains headed to and 
from Newport News and Williamsburg due to track layout. As a result, the 
Staples Mill Road station receives more trains and serves more passengers 
overall. Richmond also benefits from an excellent position in reference 
to the state's transportation network, lying at the junction of east-west 
Interstate 64 and north-south Interstate 95, two of the most heavily traveled 
highways in the state, as well as along several major rail lines. Electricity 
in the Richmond Metro area is provided by Dominion Virginia Power. The 
company, based in Richmond, is one of the nation's largest producers of 
energy, serving retail energy customers in nine states. Electricity is 
provided in the Richmond area primarily by the North Anna Nuclear Generating 
Station and Surry Nuclear Generating Station, as well as a coal-fired station 
in Chester, Virginia. These three plants provide a total of 4,453 megawatts 
of power. Several other natural gas plants provide extra power during times 
of peak demand. These include facilities in Chester, and Surry, and two 
plants in Richmond (Gravel Neck and Darbytown).[153] Natural gas in the 
Richmond Metro area is provided by the city's Department of Public Utilities 
and also serves portions of Henrico and Chesterfield counties. Water is 
provided by the city's Department of Public Utilities, and is one of the 
largest water producers in Virginia, with a modern plant that can treat 
up to 132 million gallons of water a day from the James River.[154] The 
facility also provides water to the surrounding area through wholesale 
contracts with Henrico, Chesterfield, and Hanover counties. Overall, this 
results in a facility that provides water for approximately 500,000 people. 
The wastewater treatment plant and distribution system of water mains, 
pumping stations and storage facilities provide water to approximately 
62,000 customers in the city. There is also a wastewater treatment plant 
located on the south bank of the James River. This plant can treat up to 
70 million gallons of water per day of sanitary sewage and stormwater before 
returning it to the river. The wastewater utility also operates and maintains 
1,500 miles (2,400 km) of sanitary sewer and pumping stations, 38 miles 
(61 km) of intercepting sewer lines, and the Shockoe Retention Basin, a 
44-million-gallon stormwater reservoir used during heavy rains. Richmond 
maintains the following five sister city relationships:[155] Coordinates:
