Scott Edward Kazmir (/ˈkæzmɪər/; born January 24, 1984) is an American 
professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He has previously played for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays/Rays, 
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Cleveland Indians, Oakland Athletics and 
Houston Astros. Kazmir grew up in Houston, Texas and was a pitching phenom 
at Cypress Falls High School, throwing multiple no-hitters and attracting 
the attention of major league scouts. He was drafted in the first round 
(15th overall) of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft by the New York 
Mets and quickly moved through the organization's minor league system. 
Kazmir was one of the top pitching prospects in baseball when he was sent 
to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at the 2004 trade deadline in a highly publicized 
and criticized deal. Kazmir made his major league debut with the Devil 
Rays on August 23, 2004, when he was only 20 years old.[1] Despite his 
age, Kazmir quickly became one of the better lefthanded starting pitchers 
in baseball, primarily by relying on a mid-90s fastball paired with a sharp 
breaking slider. Over the next several years, Kazmir was one of the few 
bright spots on Devil Rays teams that lost at least 91 games during his 
first four seasons with the club, winning at least 10 games in his every 
full season with the team. Kazmir was named to his first All Star team 
in 2006, led the American League with 239 strikeouts and 34 games started 
in 2007, and is still among Tampa Bay's all-time leaders in many pitching 
categories, including strikeouts, earned run average (ERA), wins, and games 
started.[2] The Devil Rays became the Rays in 2008 and got off to the best 
start in franchise history, and Kazmir was an important part of the turnaround. 
He was named American League Pitcher of the Month in May and appeared in 
his second All-Star game in July. However, a series of nagging injuries 
led to inconsistency in his pitching motion and gradually reduced his effectiveness 
over the second half of the season and in the playoffs, even as the Rays 
made it to their first World Series. Kazmir continued to struggle with 
injuries and ineffectiveness early in the 2009 season and spent some time 
on the disabled list. He had several better starts in July and August, 
at which point the Rays traded him to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 
for several minor league prospects. He pitched well for the Angels during 
the regular season, but had an ERA of over 7 during the 2009 playoffs. 
His effectiveness deteriorated further during the 2010 season, when he 
posted the highest ERA among regular American League starting pitchers. 
Continued poor performances during spring training in 2011 led the Angels 
to send Kazmir to extended spring training to retool his mechanics and 
attempt to regain his confidence. However, after a month of extra work, 
he struggled even more when returning to game action, holding an ERA of 
over 17 after five starts with the Angels' AAA team. The Angels released 
him in June 2011. Kazmir spent over a year trying to recover his pitching 
touch, working with personal coaches and trainers and pitching for short 
stints with independent minor league and winter league teams. In December 
2012, he signed a minor league deal with the Cleveland Indians and received 
an invitation to spring training. Solid performances in spring training 
earned him a spot in the Indians' starting rotation for 2013, and he pitched 
well enough to come in third in the voting for American League Comeback 
Player of the Year. In December 2013, Kazmir signed a two-year contract 
with the Oakland Athletics and continued his resurgence by winning a career-high 
15 games during the 2014 season and making his third All-Star appearance. 
Kazmir continued to pitch well for the A's in the first half of 2015, and 
with his contract expiring at the end of the season, he was traded to his 
hometown Houston Astros in July. In 2016, he signed a three-year, $48 million 
free agent contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Kazmir attended Cypress 
Falls High School in Harris County, Texas, where he was a two-sport athlete, 
through his sophomore year, pitching on the baseball team and starting 
at quarterback on the junior varsity football team. During one stretch 
on the high school baseball diamond, Kazmir threw five no-hitters in six 
games (three consecutive no-hitters, a one-hit game, followed by two more 
no-hitters).[3] As a senior, he struck out 172 batters in 75 innings pitched 
and had an earned run average (ERA) of 0.37. By the time he graduated, 
Kazmir was averaging around 17 to 18 strikeouts per game.[4] Kazmir was 
highly recruited in both sports and verbally committed to the University 
of Texas at Austin to play college baseball for the Texas Longhorns.[3] 
However, Kazmir was drafted in the first round (15th overall) of the 2002 
MLB draft by the New York Mets and signed on to play professional baseball. 
Along with teammate Clint Everts (who was selected 5th overall by the Montreal 
Expos), he became half of the first pair of high school pitchers from the 
same team drafted in the first round. Kazmir quickly advanced through the 
lower level of the Mets' minor league system and was promoted to the Binghamton 
Mets of the Class AA Eastern League on July 10, 2004 during his second 
full season of pro baseball. On July 30, he was traded along with minor 
league pitcher Joselo Díaz to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for veteran starting 
pitcher Víctor Zambrano and minor league reliever Bartolomé Fortunato. 
This trade continues to be widely criticized by the New York media and 
fan base given Kazmir's subsequent success and Zambrano's lack thereof.[5] 
The Devil Rays sent Kazmir to their Class AA affiliate, the Montgomery 
Biscuits of the Southern League, where he started four games, throwing 
25 innings and allowing 14 hits while striking out 24. In late August, 
Tampa Bay called him up to the major leagues, bypassing the Triple-A level 
altogether.[6] Kazmir made his major-league debut on August 23, 2004, pitching 
five shutout innings against the Seattle Mariners. He had a 2–3 record 
and an ERA of 5.67 in 8 appearances (7 starts) in 2004, but he was clearly 
making strides in his development; he struck out 11.07 batters per nine 
innings. On September 9, Kazmir made his only relief appearance with the 
Rays, allowing one run in three innings against the Yankees.[7] Kazmir 
started the 2006 season opener April 3 at Baltimore. At 22 years, 2 months 
and 10 days Kazmir was the youngest opening day starter since Dwight Gooden 
with the Mets in 1986. He lost the decision after 6 ER in 4 IP, but was 
subsequently extremely impressive with an overall 10–8 record with 163 
strikeouts and a 3.24 ERA in 144.2 innings pitched. Kazmir has won decisions 
against Cy Young winner Roy Halladay, two-time 20 game winner Jamie Moyer, 
two-time All Star and 20 game winner Dontrelle Willis, 2001 World Series 
co-MVP and 3-time 20 game winner Curt Schilling, 2003 World Series MVP 
Josh Beckett and Tim Wakefield, who is 14–2 lifetime against the Rays. 
On June 22, 2006 Scott Kazmir passed Sandy Koufax and put himself in the 
22nd spot in MLB history for most strikeouts by a left-handed pitcher before 
his 23rd birthday. He also picked up his team leading ninth victory in 
the process. On July 2, 2006, Kazmir was elected by the players to appear 
in the 2006 MLB All-Star Game, his first all-star appearance. The next 
day, he threw his first (and thus far only) complete game shutout, blanking 
the Boston Red Sox in Tropicana Field on 2 hits while striking out 10. 
In the All-Star Game, Kazmir threw a perfect sixth inning, retiring Freddy 
Sanchez, Carlos Beltrán, and Albert Pujols.[8] On August 22, 2006, Kazmir 
struck out eight Texas Rangers, becoming the all-time Rays strikeout leader. 
2007 is generally considered to be Kazmir's best year.[9] He led the AL 
in strikeouts (239) and games started (34) and also set career highs in 
wins (13 on a Devil Rays team that won only 64 games), innings pitched 
(206.2), and WAR (5.8).[10] Kazmir was one of the MLB's most unhittable 
pitchers in 2007, with hitters only making contact 74.5% of the time, the 
fourth best in the league.[11] In their year-end review, Baseball Prospectus 
proclaimed, "Health permitting, he`s one of the best pitchers in the AL."[12] 
It was also during this time that Tampa Bay fans began crowning Kazmir 
with the nickname "Pizza Man" which was a reference to a longstanding promotion 
at Tropicana Field where if the Rays pitching staff combined for 10 strikeouts 
during a game, attendees of the game could trade in their ticket stub for 
a free pizza at participating Papa John's restaurants. The inference was 
that when Kazmir was pitching, there was a much higher chance of a free 
pizza for fans.[13] Kazmir strained his elbow at the beginning of Spring 
training in 2008. While the injury was not considered serious at the time, 
the Rays were cautious with their star pitcher. His recovery and belated 
season preparation delayed his first start until May 4, when he faced the 
Boston Red Sox in Fenway Park.[14] After a "rocky" season debut, Kazmir 
had perhaps the best month of his career in May. He set a team record for 
wins in a month, going 5–1 with a 1.22 ERA and not allowed more than 1 
run or 4 hits in a game after his first start. For his efforts, he was 
named the AL pitcher of the month, the first Rays player to win the honor.[15] 
Kazmir was named to the American League squad for the 2008 MLB All-Star 
Game.[16] Though the Rays' management preferred that Kazmir rest his arm 
and not pitch in the mid-summer classic if at all possible,[17] the game 
ended up being the longest ever and Kazmir stepped to the mound in the 
15th inning. He threw a scoreless frame and the AL all-stars scored the 
winning run in the bottom of the 15th, making Kazmir the winning pitcher.[18] 
Kazmir was less effective over the second half of the season, posting a 
5–3 record and 4.02 ERA as the Rays won their first American League East 
championship. In the postseason, Kazmir made 5 starts and went 1–1 with 
a 4.21 ERA as the Rays won their first AL pennant. But in what was a continuing 
trend, he could never work very deep into a ballgame, averaging just 5 
innings while throwing over 100 pitches per start in the playoffs.[19] 
Kazmir averaged 4.28 pitches per plate appearance on the season, the highest 
rate in the majors.[20] "He's an ace as far as his numbers go", Baseball 
Prospectus wrote, "But he doesn't do many of the other things one expects 
from an ace. He regularly misses time here and there (in 2008 it was an 
early-season elbow strain), he's so inefficient that he often hits 100 
pitches before he's made it to the fifth inning, and he can become a scheduled 
strain on the bullpen. Don't get us wrong, he's great, and clearly worth 
the nearly $40 million he'll receive over the next four years, but he's 
far from deserving of the "ace" designation."[5] During the season, the 
Rays and Kazmir agreed on a four-year contract extension which guaranteed 
the lefty $28.5 million and had a maximum value of approximately $39.5 
million if the team picked up his option for the 2012 season.[21] Kazmir 
again started the 2009 season on the disabled list with elbow issues and 
was activated on April 8. He accrued a 4–4 record with an ERA of 7.69 before 
going on the disabled list again on May 23 to rest a leg strain[22] and 
to work on problems with his pitching mechanics.[23] He returned on June 
27 and went on to have a record of 8–7 with an ERA of 5.92 and 91 strikeouts 
as of August 28, 2009. On August 28, 2009, Kazmir was traded to the Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim for second baseman Sean Rodriguez and minor leaguers 
Alexander Torres and Matt Sweeney.[24] On his Angels debut, against the 
Seattle Mariners, he received the loss, going 6 1⁄3 innings, giving up 
one earned run and striking out eight. At one point he retired 16 batters 
in a row. Scott Kazmir made his home debut with the Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim on September 8, 2009 once again pitching against the Seattle 
Mariners, going seven innings and giving up only one run in a no-decision. 
Kazmir continued to pitch well for his new team during the remaining month 
of the regular season, posting a 2–2 record with a 1.73 ERA. However, he 
fared less well in the postseason, going 0–1 with a 7.56 ERA in two starts 
and one appearance in relief. In Spring training 2010, Kazmir noted that 
he was not in best shape in the 2009 season. "I'd get nine or 10 pitches 
into an inning, and I didn't have the explosiveness I wanted", Kazmir said. 
"I was falling off pitches and stuff like that. At one point, you kind 
of wonder."[25] In the offseason, Kazmir focused on strength and flexibility 
training to reduce strain on his arm. Manager Mike Scioscia said, "He'll 
be in the right arm slot more often instead of dropping down to compensate 
or flying open", Scioscia said. "It's all connected. With a more consistent 
delivery, he'll minimize risk to his arm, because it's not doing more work 
than it has to.".[25] Despite this winter regimen, Kazmir began the season 
on the disabled list with hamstring and shoulder issues.[26] He made his 
first start on April 15, a loss to the Yankees.[27] His struggles continued 
throughout the first half of the season, as he posted the worst ERA among 
starters in the AL (6.92) along with a 7–9 record. Quoted in the Los Angeles 
Times in July, Kazmir said "It kind of feels like I'm thinking too much 
about where I'm throwing the ball and things start snowballing, and the 
next thing you know you don't really know what's going on."[28] On July 
18, he was placed on the disabled list with left shoulder fatigue.[29] 
Kazmir returned in August to mixed results. He finished the season with 
a 9–15 record in 28 starts, and his 5.94 ERA was the highest in MLB among 
pitchers who worked 140 or more innings.[30] Kazmir struggled again in 
spring training, giving up 19 runs in 23+ innings, and was touched for 
5 runs in 2+ innings in his first regular season start. Angels manager 
Mike Scioscia said that Kazmir's struggles were "baffling" and that, despite 
a rigorous off-season training regimen, the former all-star pitcher had 
neither velocity nor command.[30] Kazmir was placed on the DL and sent 
to extended spring training to "sort things out". After working on his 
mechanics for a month, Kazmir was sent to the Salt Lake Bees, the Angels' 
Triple-A affiliate, for a series of rehabilitation starts as he tried to 
work his way back to the major leagues, possibly as a relief pitcher.[31] 
However, his struggles only grew worse in the minors. Kazmir had a 17.02 
ERA in 5 starts, walking 20 and striking out 14 in 15+ innings. He was 
released by the Angels on June 15 despite having $14.5 million remaining 
on his guaranteed contract.[32] In December 2011, Kazmir tried to start 
a comeback by pitching winter ball for Leones del Escogido in the Dominican 
League.[33] His only start did not go well, as he gave up 2 hits, 2 walks, 
and 4 earned runs in one third of an inning.[34] Kazmir continued to work 
out and held bullpen sessions for scouts from several major league teams 
over the winter and spring of 2012. However, he did not sign with a major 
league organization. On July 7, 2012, Kazmir signed with the Sugar Land 
Skeeters of the independent Atlantic League, who play near his hometown 
of Houston.[35] Kazmir started 14 games for the Skeeters and finished the 
season with a 3–6 record and a 5.34 ERA.[36] In November 2012, Kazmir signed 
with Gigantes de Carolina of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League. 
While he posted a 4.37 ERA, he struck out 27 batters in 23 innings and 
his fastball velocity was reported to be back in the 94–95 MPH range.[37] 
Kazmir signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians on December 
21, 2012 and received an invitation to spring training. After pitching 
well during the spring, he was named the team's 5th starter heading into 
the regular season.[38] On May 4, 2013 against the Minnesota Twins, Kazmir 
won his first major league game since 2010.[39] In his next start he fanned 
10 Oakland batters without issuing a walk over six innings of one-run ball 
to win his second consecutive start. It was the first time winning back-to-back 
starts since his 2010 season.[40] While not consistently regaining his 
former velocity, Kazmir's ability to better command his pitches helped 
him to have a season that saw him come in third in the voting for the 2013 
American League Comeback Player of the Year[41][42] Kazmir started 29 games 
(his most since 2007), posted a 10–9 record (most wins since 2009), and 
had a career-best strikeout to walk ratio of 3.45. After his resurgent 
season in Cleveland, Kazmir signed a two-year, $22 million contract with 
the Oakland Athletics on December 3, 2013.[43] Kazmir pitched 190 innings 
for the A's in 2014, the second highest total of his career, and finished 
the season with a 3.55 ERA and a 15 wins, a career high. Although his strikeouts 
per 9 innings rate dropped from 2013 (9.2 to 7.8), Kazmir posted a career 
best walks/hits per 9 inning rate (1.161) and was consistently effective 
until August, as his ERA rose over a full run from July until the end of 
the season.[44][45] Kazmir was named to the 2014 AL All-Star team, his 
third appearance in the game and first since 2008.[46] In 2015, Kazmir 
began the season as the A's third starter and enjoyed one of the most effective 
extended stretches of his major league career. Over his first 18 starts, 
Kazmir's 2.38 ERA and ratios of 8.3 strikeouts and 6.9 hits per nine innings 
were among the best in the American League. He was also consistent, giving 
up more than three earned runs in a start only once.[10] The A's were not 
in serious contention for a playoff spot as the trade deadline approached, 
and Kazmir was rumored to be a potential acquisition target for several 
teams seeking to improve their starting pitching.[47] On July 23, 2015, 
he was traded to the Houston Astros for two prospects - catcher Jacob Nottingham 
and pitcher Daniel Mengden.[48] Kazmir won his debut with the hometown 
Astros, going seven innings and giving up three hits with three strikeouts 
in a 4–0 Astros victory over the Kansas City Royals.[49] However, he was 
less effective with Houston than he had been with Oakland. Over 13 starts, 
he earned a 4.17 ERA with ratios of 9.6 hits and 6.6 strikeouts per nine 
innings, and his record was 2-6.[10] Houston made the playoffs as a wildcard 
team, and Kazmir started game two of the 2015 American League Division 
Series against the Kansas City Royals. He pitched into the 6th inning and 
gave up 3 runs, and although he left the game with the Astros holding a 
4-3 lead, the Royals came back to win the game 5-4 and took the series 
in five games. On December 30, 2015, Kazmir signed a 3-year, $48 million 
deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.[50] He made 26 starts for the Dodgers, 
with a 10–6 record and 4.56 ERA.[51] When Kazmir was enjoying success during 
his first several seasons, his best pitches were a four-seam fastball and 
a slider. His fastball was regularly clocked in the mid to high 90s with 
excellent command, and his preferred strike-out pitch was his slider, which 
many scouts and other observers compared to that of Hall of Famer Steve 
Carlton.[52][53] On the advice of teammate James Shields, he added a change-up, 
which also became an out pitch.[54] Repeated injuries followed by repeated 
attempts to tweak his mechanics and throwing motion saw Kazmir's entire 
repertoire dwindle in effectiveness. His fastball velocity dropped until 
topping out in the mid-80s in 2011,[55][56] and he "lost his feel" for 
the slider, using it only sporadically and with poor results after his 
early 2008 stint on the disabled list.[57][58] In 2013, Kazmir returned 
to the major leagues with a modified slider that was thrown with less velocity 
than his pre-injury pitch, registering in the mid-80s. His fastball velocity 
improved to the low to mid-90s with a mix of four-seam and two-seam fastballs. 
Kazmir continued to throw a change-up in the low 80s and an occasional
