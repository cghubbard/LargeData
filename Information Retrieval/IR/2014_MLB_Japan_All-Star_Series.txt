The 2014 MLB Japan All-Star Series was the eleventh edition of the championship, 
a best-of-five series between the All-Star team from Major League Baseball 
(MLB) and, for the first time in series history, the national team Samurai 
Japan.[1][2] The then-new Commissioner of Nippon Professional Baseball 
(NPB) saw in this championship a big opportunity for their Japanese team 
to gain hugely useful experience for the 2017 World Baseball Classic. The 
series also celebrated the 80th anniversary of the establishment of Japan's 
professional baseball by holding an exhibition game of a joint team of 
Hanshin Tigers and Yomiuri Giants against the MLB All-Stars at the Koshien 
Stadium on November 11, 2014. Samurai Japan won the series by 3–2–0 and 
Yuki Yanagita was named MVP.[3] Exhibition (1) Championship Exhibition
