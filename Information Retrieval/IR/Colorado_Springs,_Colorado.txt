Colorado Springs is a home rule municipality that is the county seat and 
the most populous municipality of El Paso County, Colorado, United States. 
Colorado Springs is located in the east central portion of the state. It 
is situated on Fountain Creek and is located 60 miles (97 km) south of 
the Colorado State Capitol in Denver. At 6,035 feet (1,839 m) the city 
stands over 1 mile (1.6 km) above sea level, though some areas of the city 
are significantly higher and lower. Colorado Springs is situated near the 
base of one of the most famous American mountains, Pikes Peak, rising above 
14,000 feet (4,300 m) on the eastern edge of the Southern Rocky Mountains. 
The city is home to 24 national governing bodies of sport, the United States 
Olympic Committee and the United States Olympic Training Center. The city 
had an estimated population of 456,568 in 2015,[6] ranking as the second 
most populous city in the state of Colorado, behind Denver, and the 40th 
most populous city in the United States.[7] The Colorado Springs, CO Metropolitan 
Statistical Area had an estimated population of 697,856 in 2015.[8] The 
city is included in the Front Range Urban Corridor, an oblong region of 
urban population along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado 
and Wyoming, generally following the path of Interstate 25 in both states. 
The city covers 194.9 square miles (505 km2), making it the most extensive 
municipality in Colorado. Colorado Springs was ranked number five by U.S. 
News & World Report on the list of 2016 Best Places to Live in the USA.[9] 
The Ute, Arapaho and Cheyenne peoples were the first to inhabit the area 
which would become Colorado Springs.[10] Part of the territory included 
in the United States' 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the current city area was 
designated part of the 1854 Kansas Territory. In 1859, after the first 
local settlement was established, it became part of the Jefferson Territory 
on October 24 and of El Paso County on November 28. Colorado City at the 
Front Range confluence of Fountain and Camp creeks was "formally organized 
on August 13, 1859"[11] during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. It served as 
the capital of the Colorado Territory from November 5, 1861, until August 14, 
1862, when the capital was moved to Denver. In 1871 the Colorado Springs 
Company laid out the towns of La Font (later called Manitou Springs) and 
Fountain Colony, upstream and downstream respectively, of Colorado City.[12] 
Within a year, Fountain Colony would be renamed "Colorado Springs", and 
was officially incorporated.[13] The El Paso County seat shifted from Colorado 
City in 1873 to the Town of Colorado Springs.[14] On December 1, 1880, 
Colorado Springs expanded northward with two annexations.[15] [16] The 
second period of annexations was during 1889–90, and included Seavey's 
Addition, West Colorado Springs, East End, and another North End addition.[15] 
In 1891 the Broadmoor Land Company built the Broadmoor suburb, which included 
the Broadmoor Casino, and by December 12, 1895, the city had "four Mining 
Exchanges and 275 mining brokers."[17] By 1898, the city was designated 
into quadrants by the north-south Cascade Avenue and the east-west Washington/Pike's 
Peak avenues.[16]:10 From 1899 to 1901 Tesla Experimental Station operated 
on Knob Hill,[18] and aircraft flights to the Broadmoor's neighboring fields 
began in 1919.[19] Alexander Airport north of the city opened in 1925, 
and in 1927 the original Colorado Springs Municipal Airport land was purchased 
east of the city.[19] In World War II the United States Army Air Forces 
leased land adjacent to the municipal airfield, naming it "Peterson Field" 
in December 1942. This was only one of several military presences in and 
around Colorado Springs during the war.[20][21] In November 1950, Ent Air 
Force Base was selected as the Cold War headquarters for Air Defense Command 
(ADC). The former WWII Army Air Base, Peterson Field, which had been inactivated 
at the end of the war, was re-opened in 1951 as a U.S. Air Force base.[22] 
The 1950s through 1970s saw a continued expansion of the military presence 
in the area, with the establishment of NORAD's headquarters in the city, 
as well as the ADCOM headquarters. Between 1965 and 1968 the University 
of Colorado Colorado Springs, Pikes Peak Community College and Colorado 
Technical University were established in or near the city.[23][24] In 1977 
most of the former Ent AFB became a US Olympic training center. The Libertarian 
Party was founded within the city in the 1970s.[25] On October 1, 1981, 
the Broadmoor Addition,[15] Cheyenne Canon, Ivywild, Skyway, and Stratton 
Meadows were annexed after the Colorado Supreme Court "overturned a district 
court decision that voided the annexation". Further annexations expanding 
the city include the Nielson Addition and Vineyard Commerce Park Annexation 
in September 2008. [15] The city lies in a high desert with the Southern 
Rocky Mountains to the west, the Palmer Divide to the north, high plains 
further east, and high desert lands to the south when leaving Fountain 
and approaching Pueblo.[26][not in citation given] According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 194.6 square miles (504.1 km2), 
of which 194.6 square miles (503.9 km2) is land and 0.35 square miles (0.9 km2), 
or 0.19%, is water.[27] Colorado Springs has many features of a modern 
urban area, such as parks, bike trails, and urban open-area spaces. However, 
it is not exempt from problems that typically plague cities that experience 
tremendous growth, such as overcrowded roads and highways, crime, sprawl, 
and government budget issues. Many of the problems are indirectly or directly 
caused by the city's difficulty in coping with the large population growth 
experienced in the last twenty years, and the annexation of the Banning 
Lewis Ranch area to accommodate further population growth of 175,000 future 
residents.[citation needed] Colorado Springs has a semi-arid climate (Köppen 
BSk), and its location just east of the Rocky Mountains affords it the 
rapid warming influence from chinook winds during winter but also subjects 
it to drastic day-to-day variability in weather conditions.[28] The city 
has abundant sunshine year-round, averaging 243 sunny days per year,[29][30] 
and receives approximately 16.5 inches (419 mm) of annual precipitation. 
Due to unusually low precipitation for several years after flooding in 
1999, Colorado Springs enacted lawn water restrictions in 2002. These were 
lifted in 2005.[26] Colorado Springs is one of the most active lightning 
strike areas in the United States. This natural phenomenon led Nikola Tesla 
to select Colorado Springs as the preferred location to build his lab and 
study electricity.[31] Winters range from mild to moderately cold, with 
December, the coldest month, averaging 30.8 °F (−0.7 °C); historically 
January has been the coldest month, but, in recent years, December has 
had both lower daily maxima and minima.[32] Typically, there are 5.2 nights 
with sub-0 °F (−18 °C) lows and 23.6 days where the high does not rise 
above freezing,[33] and extended sub-zero (°F) cold snaps are possible 
but infrequent. Snowfall is usually moderate and remains on the ground 
briefly because of direct sun, with the city receiving 38 inches (97 cm) 
per season, although the mountains to the west often receive in excess 
of triple that amount; March is the snowiest month in the region, both 
by total accumulation and number of days with measurable snowfall. In addition, 
8 of the top 10 heaviest 24-hour snowfalls have occurred from March to 
May.[33] Summers are warm, with July, the warmest month, averaging 70.9 °F 
(21.6 °C), and 18 days of 90 °F (32 °C)+ highs annually. Due to the high 
elevation and aridity, nights are usually relatively cool and rarely does 
the low remain above 70 °F (21 °C).[33] Dry weather generally prevails, 
but brief afternoon thunderstorms are common, especially in July and August 
when the city receives the majority of its annual rainfall, due to the 
North American Monsoon.[citation needed] The first autumn freeze and the 
last freeze in the spring, on average, occur on October 2 and May 6, respectively; 
the average window for measurable snowfall (≥0.1 in or 0.25 cm) is October 
21 through April 25. Extreme temperatures range from 101 °F (38 °C) on 
June 26, 2012 and most recently on June 21, 2016, down to −27 °F (−33 °C) 
on February 1, 1951 and December 9, 1919.[citation needed] As of the 2010 
census, the population of Colorado Springs was 416,427[36] (41st most populous 
U.S. city),[citation needed] and the population of the Colorado Springs 
Metropolitan Statistical Area was 645,613 in 2010 (84th most populous MSA),[37] 
and the population of the Front Range Urban Corridor in Colorado was an 
estimated 4,166,855. As of the April 2010 census:[38] 78.8% White, 16.1% 
Hispanic or Latino (of any race), 6.3% Black or African American, 3.0% 
Asian, 1.0% Native American, 0.3% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 
5.5% Some other race, 5.1% Two or more races. Mexican Americans made up 
14.6% of the city's population. The median age in the city was 35 years.[39][nb 
1] Non-Hispanic Whites were 70.7% of the population,[41] compared to 86.6% 
in 1970.[42] Colorado Springs' economy is driven primarily by the military, 
the high-tech industry, and tourism, in that order. The city is currently 
experiencing some growth mainly in the service sectors. The unemployment 
rate for the city as of October 2015 was 3.9% compared to 4.8% in October 
2014 and 7.3% in November 2013[43] and compared to 3.8% for the state [44] 
and 5.0% for the nation.[45] The defense industry plays a major role in 
the Colorado Springs economy, with some of the city's largest employers 
coming from the sector.[46] A large segment of this industry is dedicated 
to the development and operation of various projects for missile defense. 
With its close ties to defense, the aerospace industry has also influenced 
the Colorado Springs economy. Although some defense corporations have left 
or downsized city campuses, a slight growth trend is still recorded. Significant 
defense corporations in the city include Boeing, General Dynamics, Harris 
Corporation, SAIC, ITT, L-3 Communications, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop 
Grumman.[citation needed] The Space Foundation is based in Colorado Springs. 
A large percentage of Colorado Springs' economy is based on manufacturing 
high tech and complex electronic equipment. The high tech sector in the 
Colorado Springs area has decreased its overall presence from 2000 to 2006 
(from around 21,000 down to around 8,000), with notable reductions in information 
technology and complex electronic equipment.[47] Due to a slowing in tourism, 
the high tech sector still remains second to the military in terms of total 
revenue generated and employment.[citation needed] Current trends project 
the high tech employment ratio will continue to decrease in the near future.[48][49][50][51] 
High tech corporations with connections to the city include: Verizon Business, 
a telecommunications firm, had nearly 1300 employees in 2008.[52] Hewlett-Packard 
has a large sales, support, and SAN storage engineering center for the 
computer industry.[53][54][55] Storage Networking Industry Association 
is the home of the SNIA Technology Center.[citation needed] Agilent, spun 
off from HP in 1999 as an independent, publicly traded company.[citation 
needed] Intel had 250 employees in 2009.[56] The facility is now used for 
the centralized unemployment and social services complex.[citation needed] 
Broadcom (formerly LSI Corporation) designs semiconductors and software 
that accelerate storage and networking in datacenters and mobile networks.[citation 
needed] Microchip Technology (formerly Atmel), is a chip fabrication organization.[57] 
Cypress Semiconductor Colorado Design Center is a chip fabrication research 
and development site.[citation needed] The Apple Inc. facility was sold 
to Sanmina-SCI in 1996.[58] The city's location at the base of Pikes Peak 
and the Rocky Mountains makes it a popular tourism destination. Tourism 
is the third largest employer in the Pikes Peak region, accounting for 
more than 16,000 jobs.[59][citation needed] Nearly 5 million visitors come 
to the area annually, contributing $1.35 billion in revenue.[60] Colorado 
Springs has more than 55 attractions and activities in the area,[61] including 
Garden of the Gods, United States Air Force Academy, the ANA Money Museum, 
Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, Old Colorado 
City and the U.S. Olympic Training Center.[62] The downtown Colorado Springs 
Visitor Information Center offers free area information to leisure and 
business travelers.[61] The Cultural Office of the Pikes Peak Region (COPPeR), 
also located downtown, supports and advocates for the arts throughout the 
Pikes Peak Region. It operates the PeakRadar website to communicate city 
events.[63] Although houses of worship of almost every major world religion 
can be found in the city, Colorado Springs has in particular attracted 
a large influx of Evangelical Christians and Christian organizations in 
recent years. At one time Colorado Springs was counted to be the national 
headquarters for 81 different religious organizations, earning the city 
the tongue-in-cheek nicknames "the Evangelical Vatican"[64] and "The Christian 
Mecca." Religious groups with regional or international headquarters in 
Colorado Springs include: Although Colorado voters approved Colorado Amendment 
64, a constitutional amendment in 2013 legalizing retail sales of marijuana 
for recreational purposes, the Colorado Springs city council voted not 
to permit retail shops in the city, as was allowed in the amendment.[86] 
Medical marijuana outlets continue to operate in Colorado Springs.[87] 
As of 2015, there were 91 medical marijuana clinics in the city, which 
reported sales of $59.6 million in 2014, up 11 percent from the previous 
year but without recreational marijuana shops.[88] On April 26, 2016 Colorado 
Springs city council decided to extend the current six-month moratorium 
to eighteen months with no new licenses to be granted until May 2017. Colorado 
Springs has been the subject of or setting for many books, movies and television 
shows, and is a frequent backdrop for political thrillers and military-themed 
stories because of its many military installations and vital importance 
to the United States' continental defense. Notable television series using 
the city as a setting include Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman and the Stargate 
series Stargate SG-1, as well as the films WarGames and The Prestige.[89] 
In a North Korean propaganda video released in April 2013, Colorado Springs 
was inexplicably singled out as one of four targets for a missile strike. 
The video failed to pinpoint Colorado Springs on the map, instead showing 
a spot somewhere in Louisiana.[90] Colorado Springs, dubbed Olympic City 
USA, is home to the United States Olympic Training Center and the headquarters 
of the United States Olympic Committee and the United States Anti-Doping 
Agency.[91] In addition, 24 of the United States' national federations 
for individual Olympic sports have their headquarters in Colorado Springs, 
including: United States or USA bobsled, fencing, figure skating, basketball, 
boxing, cycling, judo, field hockey, hockey, swimming, shooting, table 
tennis, taekwondo, triathlon, volleyball, pentathlon, handball, and wrestling 
associations and organizations. Further, over 50 national sports organizations 
(non-Olympic) headquarter in Colorado Springs. Among them, the National 
Strength and Conditioning Association, Sports Incubator, a host of non-Olympic 
Sports, and more.[92] Colorado Springs and Denver hosted the 1962 World 
Ice Hockey Championships.[nb 2] The city has a particularly long association 
with the sport of figure skating, having hosted the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships six times and the World Figure Skating Championships five 
times. It is home to the World Figure Skating Museum and Hall of Fame and 
the Broadmoor Skating Club, a notable training center for the sport. In 
recent years, the World Arena has hosted skating events such as Skate America 
and the Four Continents Figure Skating Championships.[93] The Pikes Peak 
International Hill Climb (PPIHC), also known as The Race to the Clouds, 
is an annual invitational automobile and motorcycle hill climb to the summit 
of Pikes Peak, every year on the last Sunday of June. The first running 
of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb was promoted by Spencer Penrose. Penrose had 
finished widening the narrow carriage road into a much wider "Pikes Peak 
Highway." He decided to encourage tourists to visit by creating a race 
to the clouds. The PPIHC takes place on a 12.42 mile (19.99 km) public 
toll-road boasting 156 turns, while competitors climb 4,720 ft. (1,440 
m.) from the 9,390 ft. (2,862 m.) Start Line at Mile 7 marker on the Pikes 
Peak Highway to the 14,115 ft. (4,300 m) Finish Line at the mountain's 
summit. As the drivers climb toward the summit, the thin air slows reflexes 
and saps competitor's mental and muscle strength in addition to robbing 
internal combustion engines of up to 30% of the power they are capable 
of at the Start Line. Competitors and vehicles must be in top shape and 
condition simply to finish, let alone win. The race is self-sanctioned 
and is the most diverse one day motorsports event in the world with everything 
from Sidecars, Motorcycles, Semi-Trucks, and 1,400+hp EV & Unlimited Racers 
being able to compete in the same event. The highway wasn't completely 
paved until 2011.[94] The local colleges feature many sports teams. Notable 
among them are the following nationally competitive NCAA Division I teams: 
United States Air Force Academy (Falcons) Football, Basketball and Hockey,[97] 
Colorado College (Tigers) Hockey, and Women's Soccer.[98] The Mountain 
West Conference and the National Collegiate Hockey Conference is based 
in Colorado Springs. Colorado Springs is home to the Pro Rodeo Hall of 
Fame and the headquarters of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association. 
Colorado Springs was the original headquarters of the Professional Bull 
Riders (PBR) from its founding in 1992 until 2005, when the organization 
was moved to Pueblo; the PBR used to hold an annual Built Ford Tough Series 
event at the World Arena from 2001 until 2005 when the organization made 
the move to Pueblo.[citation needed] There are 136 neighborhood, 8 community, 
7 regional parks and 5 sports complexes totaling 9,000 acres managed by 
the city's Parks, Recreation and Cultural Services. They also manage 500 
acres of trails, which are 160 miles of park trails and 105 miles of urban 
trails. There are 5,000 acres of open spaces in 48 open space areas.[99] 
One of the most popular areas in Colorado Springs is the park on its western 
edge, Garden of the Gods, considered by many to be the most beautiful park 
in the world.[100] It is a National Natural Landmark with 300 foot sandstone 
rock formations often viewed against a backdrop of the snow-capped mountains 
of Pikes Peak. The park offers a variety of annual events, one of the most 
popular of which is the Starlight Spectacular; a recreational bike ride 
held every summer to benefit the Trails and Open Space Coalition of Colorado 
Springs.[citation needed] Colorado Springs has several major parks, such 
as Palmer Park, America the Beautiful Park (Confluence Park), Memorial 
Park, and Monument Valley Park.[101] The Austin Bluffs Park also affords 
a place of recreation in eastern Colorado Springs. Garden of the Gods Ackerman 
Overlook near United States Air Force Academy off Interstate 25 in Colorado 
Springs is named for Jasper D. Ackerman (1896–1988), a banker and rancher.[102] 
Pulpit Rock, in Pikeview (North Colorado Springs) Three trails, the New 
Santa Fe Regional Trail, Pikes Peak Greenway and Fountain Creek Regional 
Trail, form a continuous path from Palmer Lake, through Colorado Springs, 
to Fountain, Colorado. The majority of the trail between Palmer Lake and 
Fountain is a soft surface breeze gravel trail. A major segment of the 
trail within the Colorado Springs city limits is paved. The Urban Trail 
system within Colorado Springs consists of more than 110 miles of multi-use 
trail for biking, jogging, roller blading and walking. The trails, except 
Monument Valley Park trails, may be used for equestrian traffic. Motorized 
vehicles are not allowed on the trails. Many of the trails are interconnected, 
having main "spine" trails, like the Pikes Peak Greenway, that lead to 
secondary trails.[103][104][105] On November 2, 2010, Colorado Springs 
voters adopted a council-strong mayor form of government. The City of Colorado 
Springs transitioned to the new system of government in 2011. Under the 
council-strong mayor system of government, the mayor is the chief executive 
and the city council is the legislative branch. The mayor is a full-time 
elected position and not a member of the city council. The city council 
has nine members total, six of which represent one of six equally populated 
districts each. The remaining three members are elected "at-large".[106] 
The mayor has veto authority, with the city council having the ability 
to override a mayoral veto by a two-thirds majority vote (6 out of 9). 
Colorado Springs City Hall was built from 1902 to 1904 on land donated 
by W. S. Stratton.[107] Public schools The city's public schools are divided 
into several districts: Private schools Bachelors and graduate degree programs 
are offered at these colleges and universities in the city: The United 
States Air Force Academy is a military school for officer candidates.[113] 
IntelliTec College is a technical training school. Pikes Peak Community 
College offers a two-year degree program.[114][115] In March 2016 there 
were six newspapers actively publishing in Colorado Springs including the 
newspaper with the largest circulation in the state. Colorado-Pueblo MSA 
is the 90th largest broadcast market in the USA. There are 24 digital television 
stations in Colorado Springs and 34 radio stations. Colorado Springs is 
primarily served by two interstate highways. I-25 runs north and south 
through Colorado, and traverses the city for nearly 18 miles (29 km), entering 
the city south of Circle Drive and exiting north of North Gate Blvd. In 
El Paso County it is known as Ronald Reagan Highway.[nb 3] US 24 runs across 
the central mountains, through the city, and onto the plains. From west 
to east in Colorado Springs, US 24 follows the western portion of Cimarron 
Street and the Midland Expressway, a 2-mile concurrent section with I-25/US 
87 between exits 139 and 141, part of Fountain Blvd, an expressway called 
the Martin Luther King Bypass, part of South Powers Blvd (where it is concurrent 
with Colorado 21), and the easternmost portion of Platte Avenue out of 
the city. A number of state highways serve the city. State Highway 21 is 
a major east side semi-expressway from Black Forest to Fountain. It is 
widely known as Powers Boulevard. State Highway 83 runs north-south from 
Denver to northern Colorado Springs. State Highway 94 runs east-west from 
western Cheyenne County to eastern Colorado Springs. State Highway 115 
begins in Cañon City and runs up Nevada Avenue. US 85 and SH 115 are concurrent 
between Lake Avenue and I-25. US 85 enters the city at Fountain and was 
signed at Venetucci Blvd, Lake Avenue, and Nevada Avenue.[nb 4] In November 
2015, voters in Colorado Springs overwhelmingly passed ballot measure 2C, 
dedicating funds from a temporary sales tax increase to much needed road 
and infrastructure improvements over five years. This temporary increase 
is estimated to bring in approximately $50M annually, which will be used 
solely to improve roads and infrastructure. The Ballot measure passed by 
a margin of approximately 65%-35%,[120] and was championed by newly elected 
Mayor John Suthers. In 2004, the voters of Colorado Springs and El Paso 
County established the Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority[121] and 
adopted a 1% sales tax dedicated to improving the region's transportation 
infrastructure. Together with state funding for the Colorado Springs Metro 
Interstate Expansion (COSMIX) (2007 completion) and the I-25 interchange 
with Highway 16 (2008 completion), significant progress has been made since 
2003 in addressing the transportation needs of the area. In early 2010, 
the city of Colorado Springs approved an expansion of the northernmost 
part of Powers Boulevard in order to create an Interstate 25 bypass commonly 
referred to as the Copper Ridge Expansion.[122][nb 5] A 2011 study by Walk 
Score ranked Colorado Springs 34th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. 
cities.[124] Mountain Metropolitan Transit (MMT) is the primary source 
of clean, safe, and economical public transportation services in the Pikes 
Peak region providing over 11,000 one-way trips per day. In addition to 
bus routes within the City of Colorado Springs, Mountain Metro Transit 
provides service into Manitou Springs, north to the Chapel Hills Mall, 
east to Peterson Air Force Base and south into the Widefield area. Mountain 
Metro Mobility is an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) federally mandated 
complementary ADA paratransit service, which provides demand-response service 
for individuals with mobility needs that prevent them from using the fixed-route 
bus system. Mountain Metro Rides offers alternative transportation options 
to residents of the Pikes Peak Region. The program is designed to reduce 
congestion and pollution by encouraging people to commute by carpool, vanpool, 
bicycling or walking. Sister cities of Colorado Springs include: Colorado 
Springs' sister city organization began when Colorado Springs became partners 
with Fujiyoshida. The torii gate erected to commemorate the relationship 
stands at the corner of Bijou Street and Nevada Avenue, and is one of the 
city's most recognizable landmarks. The torii gate, crisscrossed bridge 
and shrine, located in the median between Platte and Bijou Streets in downtown 
Colorado Springs, were a gift to Colorado Springs, erected in 1966 by the 
Rotary Club of Colorado Springs to celebrate the friendship between the 
two communities. A plaque near the torii gate states that "the purpose 
of the sister city relationship is to promote understanding between the 
people of our two countries and cities". The Fujiyoshida Student exchange 
program has become an annual event.[citation needed] To strengthen relations 
between the two cities, the Colorado Springs Youth Symphony regularly invites 
the Taiko drummers from the city to participate in a joint concert in the 
Pikes Peak Center. The orchestra played in Bankstown, Australia, in 2002 
and again in June 2006 as part of their tours to Australia and New Zealand.[citation 
needed] Also, in 2006 and 2010, the Bankstown TAP (Talent Advancement Program), 
performed with the Youth Symphony, and the Colorado Springs Children's 
Chorale, as a part of the annual "In Harmony" program.[citation needed] 
A notable similarity between Colorado Springs and its sister cities are 
their geographic positions: three of the seven cities are also located
