This article lists a chronology of Stanley Cup engravings. A unique feature 
of the Stanley Cup is that, with few exceptions in the past, it is the 
only trophy in professional sports that has the name of the winning players, 
coaches, management, and club staff engraved on it.[1] This has not always 
been the case. When he first donated the Cup in 1892, one of Lord Stanley 
of Preston's original conditions was that each team could, at their own 
expense, add a ring on the Cup to commemorate their Cup victory (the first 
year being an exception). Lord Stanley's original trophy was simply a silver 
bowl minted with the words "Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup" on one side 
of the outside rim, and "From Stanley of Preston" with his family's coat 
of arms on the other side. The format and location of the engravings, including 
the addition and deletion of extra bands and rings attached to the bottom 
of Lord Stanley's original cup/bowl, has changed through the years. For 
unknown reasons some teams (details below), did not engrave their names 
on the Cup. This was rectified in the '1948 Redesign'. During the Challenge 
Cup Era from 1893–1914, the Stanley Cup was a "challenge trophy"; the champions 
held onto the Cup until they either lost their league title to another 
club, or a champion from another league issued a formal challenge and subsequently 
defeated the reigning Cup champion in a special game or series. Teams had 
to add their names to the trophy at their own expense. Initially, there 
was only one ring, the one added by the first Cup champion Montreal HC. 
Clubs then engraved their team names, usually in the form "[TEAM NAME] 
[YEAR WON]", on that one ring until it was full in 1902. With no room to 
engrave their names (perhaps unwilling to pay for a second band to the 
Cup), teams started leaving their mark on the bowl itself. A second ring 
was finally added by the Ottawa Senators in 1909. As mentioned earlier 
in this article, some teams during this era did not engrave their names 
on the Cup. (*) Note: The Winnipeg Victorias engraved "1895" instead of 
"1896" because they won their Stanley Cup Challenge against Montreal prior 
to the end of the 1896 season. Before the 1914–15 season, a new agreement 
was reached in which the respective champions of the NHA and the Pacific 
Coast Hockey Association would face each other for the Cup, similar to 
baseball's World Series played between the American League and National 
League champions. This agreement effectively ended the Challenge Cup rule 
in which a new champion was crowned after it won the title of the previous 
champion's league. However, the 1915 Ottawa Senators, the 1916 Portland 
Rosebuds, and the 1918 Vancouver Millionaires all engraved their names 
on the Cup even though they did not officially win it under the new system. 
The NHA dissolved in 1917, and the National Hockey League (NHL) took its 
place. Then after the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) was born in 1921, 
it was agreed that all three league champions would play for the Cup. The 
PCHA and the WCHL later merged to form the Western Hockey League (WHL) 
in 1924. The WHL folded before the 1926-27 season began. As a result, the 
Cup has since been awarded to the annual NHL champions. Once the Cup became, 
effectively, the NHL championship trophy, the engraving of the Cup winner's 
information became a consistent annual tradition. This means that no Cup 
winning team has been missed since the 1922-23 Ottawa Senators chose to 
leave their name off the Cup. Originally, a new band was added almost every 
year, causing the Cup to grow in size. Thus, it became commonly referred 
to as the "Stovepipe Cup" because of its resemblance to the exhaust pipe 
of a stove. It was also occasionally called the "cigar" Cup or the "elephant's 
leg" Cup for similar reasons. With the Stovepipe Cup becoming impractical 
because of its ever-increasing height, the NHL decided to redesign the 
trophy. The base of the Stovepipe Cup (all of the bands before the New 
York Rangers' 1928 ring) was moved back to the top directly under the bowl. 
A new shoulder collar was added below, onto which only the names of the 
previous winning teams were engraved. This new shoulder includes all winning 
team names only. The 1908, 1910 Montreal Wanderers, 1911 Ottawa Senators, 
1918 Toronto Arenas, 1922 Toronto St. Pats, 1920, 1921, 1923 Ottawa Senators 
team names were finally added to the Cup. The cancelled 1919 Stanley Cup 
Finals was also acknowledged with "1919/Montreal Canadiens/Seattle Metropolitans/Series 
Not Completed". Room was left on the new collar for future teams. All of 
the 1927–28 to 1945–46 rings from the Stovepipe Cup were redone into nine 
bands of various heights that were attached below the new collar, forming 
a vastly expanded barrel-like body. The first 5 rings and half the sixth 
ring included the winners 1928, 1930 to 1939. There was room to add one 
more team the sixth band. 1956 was winner added later. Underneath that 
was a replica of the wide 1940 band from the Stovepipe Cup, but expanded 
to allow room for all winners from 1940 to 1951. The 1946–47 Cup champion 
Toronto Maple Leafs, who had to wait a year because of the redesign, was 
also added to the wide band. Finally, two more narrow blank bands were 
added to the bottom of the trophy for the winners 1952 to 1955. As soon 
as the 1956 Montreal Canadiens added their names to the Cup, all of the 
various narrow and wide bands of the trophy's barrel was full. Therefore, 
they were replaced with five symmetrical bands, each of which could contain 
13 winning teams. The winning teams and rosters from 1927–28 to 1939–40 
were engraved on the first band, the 1940–41 to 1952–53 champions on the 
second band, and the 1953–54 winners onward on the third band. Although 
the bands were originally designed to fill up during the Cup's centennial 
year, the names of the 1964–65 Montreal Canadiens were engraved over a 
larger area than allotted (and thus there are 12 teams on that band instead 
of 13). Also the Cup underwent several minor alterations, namely the retirement 
of the collar in 1963 and the bowl in 1969 in favor of duplicates because 
the originals became too brittle. After the bands were finally all filled, 
the top band of the large barrel, with the 1927–28 to 1939–40 champions, 
was taken to the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band was introduced 
at the bottom so the size of the Stanley Cup would not grow further. One 
year later, the shoulder collar listing the names of the previous winners 
was also filled to capacity, but it was decided to keep it on the trophy, 
unchanged in perpetuity. 1991-92 Pittsburgh Penguins was last winning team 
to be engraved on the collar. The band listing the 1940–41 to 1952–53 Cup 
winners was scheduled to be retired following the crowning of the 2004–05 
champions. However, that season was cancelled because of a labour dispute. 
The ring was finally taken to the Hockey Hall of Fame one year later after 
the 2005–06 champion Carolina Hurricanes were crowned. In addition to listing 
the names of the Hurricanes on the new bottom ring, it was decided to also 
acknowledge the cancelled 2004–05 season. The next ring retirement is scheduled
