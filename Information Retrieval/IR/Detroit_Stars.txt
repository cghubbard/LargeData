The Detroit Stars were an American baseball team in the Negro leagues and 
played at historic Mack Park. There were several incarnations of the Stars; 
the original Stars from 1919–1931, the second incarnation in 1933, the 
third version in 1937 and a last resurrection from 1954–1961 when the Negro 
leagues were more of a minor league. Founded in 1919 by Tenny Blount with 
the help of Rube Foster, owner and manager of the Chicago American Giants, 
the Detroit Stars immediately established themselves as one of the most 
powerful teams in the West. Foster transferred several of his veteran players 
to the team, including player-manager Pete Hill and legendary catcher Bruce 
Petway. Left-hander John Donaldson, Frank Wickware, Dicta Johnson, and 
Cuban great José Méndez took up the pitching duties, and Texan Edgar Wesley 
was brought in to handle first base, a job he would hold for several years. 
The Stars became a charter member of the Negro National League (NNL) in 
1920.[1] New outfielder Jimmie Lyons enjoyed a brilliant season at bat, 
and Detroit came in second with a 35-23 record. The next season Lyons was 
transferred to the American Giants, and the team slumped to 32-32 and fourth 
place. This would be their low point for some time. For the rest of their 
tenure in the NNL, the Stars were consistently good (finishing under .500 
only twice), but not brilliant (finishing as high as second place only 
twice). The mainstays of the Detroit Stars during the 1920s were Hall of 
Fame center fielder Turkey Stearnes, who ranks among the all-time Negro 
league leaders in nearly every batting category; Hall of Fame pitcher Andy 
Cooper, a workhorse southpaw; pitcher Bill Holland; and first baseman Wesley, 
who led the league in home runs twice and batting average once. Pete Hill 
left after the 1921 season. Bruce Petway took his place as manager until 
1926, when Candy Jim Taylor briefly held the position. Bingo DeMoss, yet 
another Rube Foster protégé, took over in 1927, and finally led the team 
to its first postseason berth in 1930. The Stars won the second-half season 
title, only to lose the playoff series to the St. Louis Stars. After the 
collapse of the Negro National League at the end of 1931, the original 
Stars baseball team disbanded. In 1933 the team reappeared in the newly 
reformed Negro National League. This team was actually the second incarnation 
of the Indianapolis ABCs who, shortly after opening day, shifted to Detroit 
and were renamed the Stars. This team lasted for one season before again 
disbanding. The third version of the Stars were a major Negro league baseball 
team that played in the Negro American League for one season in 1937. They 
were a charter member of the NAL, but the team disbanded prior to the 1938 
season. The team was not affiliated with the original Detroit Stars. After 
the integration of blacks into organized white leagues, a minor league 
version of the Stars appeared in 1954. In 1958, Detroit Stars owner Ted 
Rasberry renamed his team "Goose Tatum's Detroit Clowns" after Reece "Goose" 
Tatum, a famous member of basketball's Harlem Globetrotters and a Negro 
league superstar. The team ceased operations around 1959. Detroit-New Orleans 
Stars: The team played home games in both Detroit and New Orleans during 
the 1960 and 1961 seasons. During the 1920s the Stars made their home at 
Mack Park before moving to Hamtramck Stadium during the 1930–1931 seasons. 
The second version of the Stars also played at Mack Park in 1933. The third 
version of the Stars played at DeQuindre Park for their single season in 
the Negro American League in 1937.[3] The fourth version of the Stars from 
1954–1961 played at Mack Park and when playing as the Detroit-New Orleans 
Stars from 1960–1961 they played at both Mack Park and Stars Field. The
