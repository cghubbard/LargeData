Todd Lynn Helton (born August 20, 1973) is a former American professional 
baseball first baseman who played his entire 17-year career for the Colorado 
Rockies of Major League Baseball (MLB). A five-time All-Star, four-time 
Silver Slugger, and three-time Gold Glove Award winner, Helton holds the 
Colorado Rockies club records for hits (2,519), home runs (369), doubles 
(592), walks (1,335), runs scored (1,401), runs batted in (RBI, with 1,406), 
games played (2,247), and total bases (4,292), among others.[1] Each season 
from 1999–2004, Helton met or exceeded all of the following totals: .320 
batting average, 39 doubles, 30 home runs, 107 runs scored, 96 RBI, .577 
slugging percentage and .981 on-base plus slugging. In 2000, he won the 
batting title with a .372 average, and also led MLB with a .698 slugging 
percentage, 59 doubles, 147 RBI and the National League with 216 hits. 
Helton amassed his 2,000th career hit against the Atlanta Braves on May 
19, 2009, and his 2,500th against the Cincinnati Reds on September 1, 2013. 
Helton attended Central High School in Knoxville, Tennessee and was a letterman 
in football and baseball.[2] In football, he posted 2,772 total yards as 
quarterback. In baseball, as a senior, Helton posted a .655 batting average 
and 12 home runs and was named the Regional Player of the Year. Baseball 
America also bestowed him with All-American honors for his senior season.[2] 
Helton was drafted in the 2nd round (55th overall) by the San Diego Padres 
during the 1992 MLB draft. He did not sign and chose to attend college. 
Helton received an athletic scholarship from the University of Tennessee 
to play both football and baseball. He was named a Gatorade Player of the 
Year for football and baseball at Tennessee.[2] As a freshman and sophomore, 
he backed up Heath Shuler at quarterback. Entering his junior season in 
1994, he was the back-up to senior Jerry Colquitt and ahead of Peyton Manning 
(then a true freshman). After Colquitt tore knee ligaments in the season 
opener at UCLA, Helton took over as the starter. Three weeks later against 
Mississippi State, he suffered a knee injury himself and was replaced by 
Manning. Manning went on to break several records and eventually be drafted 
first overall by the Indianapolis Colts[3] after his senior year. Helton 
appeared in 12 games during his career with UT's football team, completing 
41 of 75 passes for 484 yards, four touchdowns, and three interceptions.[4] 
In baseball, Helton was awarded the Dick Howser Trophy as National Collegiate 
Baseball Player of the Year following his junior baseball season in 1995. 
During his career at UT (1993–1995), he registered a .370 batting average, 
with 38 home runs and 238 RBIs (both school records). As the team's closer, 
he set the NCAA record for most consecutive scoreless innings pitched (47). 
In 1995, he set the Tennessee saves record with 11, while posting a 0.89 
ERA. During his career, he pitched 193 innings, registering an ERA of 2.24, 
with 172 strikeouts and 23 saves.[5][6] Helton spent the summer of 1994 
playing for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Todd 
qualified as a U.S. Army ROTC Cadet by successfully completing the basic 
course. Helton was drafted in the first round, eighth overall, in the 1995 
Major League Baseball draft by the Colorado Rockies.[7] He was signed on 
August 1, 1995.[7] Helton spent the next couple of years playing for the 
class-A Asheville Tourists, AA New Haven Ravens and AAA Colorado Springs 
Sky Sox before getting a crack at the major leagues. He made his major-league 
debut on August 1, 1997, in a 6–5 road loss against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[8][9] 
Helton started in left field and flied out in his first at-bat.[8] He recorded 
his first hit, a single, in his second at-bat off Francisco Córdova.[8] 
Helton also hit his first home run, a solo shot, that day off Marc Wilkins.[8] 
During the 1997 season, Helton hit .280/.337/.484 (batting average, on-base 
percentage, slugging percentage), with five home runs, in 35 games played. 
When Rockies first baseman Andrés Galarraga went to the Atlanta Braves 
in 1998, Helton became the full-time starter at first base for Colorado 
during the 1998 season. The Rockies named Helton their club representative 
in 1998, the first time the team ever gave a rookie that role.[2] He hit 
.315/.380/.530, with 25 home runs and 97 RBI, in 152 games played. Helton 
led all major-league rookies in average (.315), homers (25), RBI (97), 
multi-hit games (49), total bases (281), slugging percentage (.530) and 
extra base hits (63).[10] He also led all National League rookies in runs 
(78), hits (167) and on-base percentage (.380). At the time, only Mike 
Piazza (35), David Justice (28) and Darryl Strawberry (26) had hit more 
homers as an NL rookie since 1972, and only Piazza had more RBI (112).[10] 
Helton finished second to Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs in the voting 
for National League Rookie of the Year.[10] The Tennessee Sports Hall of 
Fame named Helton its 1998 Professional Athlete of the Year.[2] In 1999, 
Helton had a .320 batting average, .395 on-base percentage and .587 slugging 
percentage.[11] He also hit 35 home runs and 113 RBI, while drawing 68 
walks. On June 19, 1999, in a 10–2 Rockies home win over the Florida Marlins, 
Helton hit for the cycle.[12][13] He fell short of hitting a second cycle 
on four different occasions during the 1999 season, which would have made 
him only the second player since 1900 (Babe Herman was the first to do 
so in 1931) to hit two cycles in one season.[12] Helton enjoyed arguably 
his best season in 2000, leading the major leagues in batting average (.372), 
RBI (147), doubles (59), total bases (405), extra base hits (103), slugging 
percentage (.698) and OPS (1.162).[14][15] He led the National League in 
hits (216) and on-base percentage (.463). Helton hit a league-leading home 
batting average of .391 and placed third in the National League in road 
batting average (.353).[14] Helton's MLB-leading 103 extra base hits tied 
for the fourth most in MLB history and the second most in NL history.[14] 
His National League-leading numbers in on-base percentage, slugging percentage 
and batting average gave him the "percentage triple crown."[14] Helton 
became the second Rockies player (Larry Walker in 1999) to accomplish that 
feat.[14] Helton and Walker made the Rockies the first team in MLB history 
to record percentage triple crowns in consecutive seasons with different 
players.[14] Helton became only the fourth player in National League history 
to lead the NL in both batting average and RBI.[14] He became the first 
player in National League history and the fifth player in MLB history (Babe 
Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx and Hank Greenberg are the others) to have 
at least 200 hits, 40 home runs, 100 RBI, 100 runs, 100 extra base hits 
and 100 walks in one season.[14] Helton was invited to his first career 
Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 2000.[14] He also received National 
League Player of the Month honors for May and August. He finished fifth 
in voting for the MVP award. However, the Associated Press, The Sporting 
News, USA Baseball Alumni and Baseball Digest all named Helton the MLB 
Player of the Year.[14] Buck O'Neil and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum 
presented Helton with the Walter Fenner "Buck" Leonard Legacy Award.[14] 
Helton was also given the team-honored version of the Roberto Clemente 
Man of Year Award, for his community contributions to Eastern Tennessee.[14] 
Furthermore, he was the National League winner of the second annual Hank 
Aaron Award.[14] For all of his success, the Colorado Rockies rewarded 
Helton with a nine-year, $141.5 million contract in April 2001 that took 
effect in 2003.[16] The following season, Helton posted a career-high 49 
home runs (22 of them occurred away from Coors Field).[17] The 49 home 
runs tied teammate Larry Walker for the most home runs ever by a Colorado 
Rockies player in a single season.[17] Additionally, Helton had a .336 
batting average, .432 on-base percentage and .685 slugging percentage.[17] 
He also had 105 extra base hits, making him the first player in MLB history 
to have at least 100 total extra base hits in back-to-back seasons.[17] 
Furthermore, Helton attained 402 total bases, making him only the fourth 
player in MLB history to do so in consecutive seasons (Chuck Klein, Gehrig 
and Foxx are the others).[17] Helton appeared in his second consecutive 
All-Star game in 2001 – his first as a starter.[17] He won his first Gold 
Glove at first base and was once again a top candidate for MVP, but was 
overshadowed by Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds. In 2002, Helton had a .329 
batting average, 30 home runs, 109 RBI, 98 walks, 107 runs, .577 slg % 
and 319 total bases.[18] He became the first player in Rockies history 
to score at least 100 runs in four consecutive seasons.[18] He was named 
Player of the Month for May, as he hit .347 with six doubles, one triple, 
10 homers and 28 RBI during the month.[18] Helton was named to his third 
consecutive All-Star game – second straight as a starter.[18] He also received 
his second consecutive Gold Glove.[18] 2003 saw Helton involved in the 
closest NL batting race in history, as he hit .35849, while St. Louis Cardinals 
first baseman Albert Pujols finished first with a .35871 batting average.[19] 
During the season, Helton also had 33 home runs, 117 RBI, 135 runs, 49 
doubles and five triples. He won his fourth Player of the Month honor during 
the month of April, as he hit .337 with six home runs, 27 RBI, 28 runs, 
11 doubles and 24 walks.[19] He also appeared in his fourth consecutive 
All-Star game. During the 2004 season, Helton again finished second in 
the NL batting race, as he hit .347, while San Francisco Giants left fielder 
Barry Bonds hit .362. Helton also had 32 homers and 96 RBI on the season. 
He became the first player in MLB history to hit at least .315 with 25 
HR and 95 RBI in each of his first seven full seasons in the majors.[20] 
He became only the third player in MLB history to accomplish that feat 
during any seven-year stretch in a career (Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth are 
the others).[20] He set a franchise record by hitting at least 30 home 
runs in six consecutive seasons.[20] Helton was named to his team-record 
fifth consecutive All-Star game and won his third Gold Glove during the 
season.[20] In 2005, Helton spent time on the disabled list (July 26 – 
August 9) for the first time in his career with a strained left calf muscle.[21] 
He hit .320 with 20 home runs, 79 RBI, 92 runs and 45 doubles for the season. 
He was under 1.000 in OPS (finished with .979 OPS) for the first time since 
1999.[11] Helton also wasn't named to the National League All-Star team 
for the first time since 1999. However, he did end up joining Gehrig and 
Bill Terry as the only first basemen in MLB history to have at least a 
.315 batting average in eight consecutive seasons.[21] The following season, 
Helton had to spend time on the disabled list again, this time from April 
20 – May 4, as he was diagnosed with acute terminal ileitis.[22] He hit 
.302 with 15 home runs, 81 RBI, 40 doubles, 91 walks and a .404 on-base 
percentage for the season.[22] He ended the season below .900 in OPS (he 
had .880 OPS) for the first time since entering the league in 1997 when 
he only played 35 games that year.[11] Helton finished third on the Rockies 
roster in 2006 in runs (94), hits (165), doubles (40), total bases (260) 
and multi-hit games (42).[22] Also in 2005, St. Louis Cardinals radio broadcaster 
Wayne Hagin claimed manager Don Baylor said that Helton had "tried the 
juice" in the 1990s, implying steroid use. Helton vehemently denied the 
allegation and considered legal action against Hagin. Hagin later apologized 
clarifying his comments saying he was "referring to supplements, creatine, 
not steroids" when he said "juiced". Baylor said of his conversation with 
Hagin "We discussed creatine and that was the end of the conversation. 
Steroid use was never even a question with me in regards to Todd Helton. 
[Hagin] has his facts wrong."[23] Helton's power and RBI production stayed 
relatively level to his previous year's stats during the 2007 season, as 
he managed 17 home runs and 91 RBI. Despite these numbers being below his 
career averages, Helton has so far kept up his string of seven consecutive 
seasons with an on-base percentage higher than .400, nine consecutive seasons 
with a batting average above .300, and has also been walked more times 
than he has struck out (a feat he has accomplished in seven of his first 
ten full seasons).[11] Helton recorded his 1,000th career hit at Coors 
Field on June 20, 2007, in a 6–1 home win over the New York Yankees, becoming 
only the fifth active player to have 1,000 career hits in one ballpark.[24] 
On September 9, 2007, in 4–2 home victory over the San Diego Padres, Helton 
hit his 35th double of the season. This made him the only player in MLB 
history to have hit 35 or more doubles in at least 10 consecutive seasons 
(1998–2007).[25][26] Helton hit his 300th career home run on September 
16, 2007, in a 13–0 home win over the Florida Marlins.[27][28] He became 
the first player to hit 300 home runs for the Colorado Rockies. Helton 
made what was arguably the most pivotal play of the Rockies' 2007 season 
in the second game of a doubleheader against the Los Angeles Dodgers on 
September 18, 2007. In the bottom of the ninth inning, with two outs and 
two strikes, Helton hit an emotional two-run walk-off home run off Dodgers 
closer Takashi Saito.[29] The home run kept the Rockies alive in the bid 
to win the wild card or National League West title. The Rockies eventually 
clinched the National League wild card, in a 9–8 extra innings victory 
over the San Diego Padres in a wild card tiebreaker game, allowing Helton 
to appear in the playoffs for the first time in his career.[30] Colorado 
went on to sweep the Philadelphia Phillies in three games of the National 
League Division Series. Helton hit a triple in the first pitch of his first 
career playoff at-bat in the opening game against the Phillies at Philadelphia.[31] 
The Rockies also swept the Arizona Diamondbacks in four games of the National 
League Championship Series, sending the Rockies on their first trip to 
the World Series in franchise history.[32] The Rockies would however lose 
the World Series to the Boston Red Sox in 4 games. In August 2008, Helton 
was diagnosed with a degenerative back condition, putting his health and 
ability to continue play in question. On May 19, 2009, Helton got his 2,000th 
hit, a single, as part of an 8–1 road loss to the Atlanta Braves.[33] On 
July 22, 2009, Helton hit his 500th career double in a 4–3 home victory 
over the Arizona Diamondbacks.[34] He became the 50th player in MLB history 
to hit 500 career doubles and the fastest to do since 1954.[35] Helton 
also joined Babe Ruth, Stan Musial, Lou Gehrig and Ted Williams as the 
only players in MLB history to have at least 500 doubles, 320 home runs 
and a .325 batting average for a career.[34] On March 11, 2010, Helton 
signed a two-year contract extension through the 2013 season. The extension 
for 2012 and 2013 will be worth a total of $9.9 million.[36] Helton's degenerative 
back condition sent him back to the disabled list in July 2010.[37] Helton 
returned from the DL in August and hit .256 with 8 HR and 37 RBI for the 
season. After the 2010 season, Helton said he would return to the Rockies 
in 2011, following rumors of a possible retirement.[38] On February 15, 
2011, Helton announced his intention to play baseball for three more years, 
preferably for the Rockies. On June 30 he played his 2,000th career game. 
On April 14, 2012 Helton hit a 2-run walk-off home run, his 7th of his 
career. On July 13, Helton was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to 
inflammation in his right hip. In 63 games he was batting .235.[39] After 
returning from the DL, Helton played only 6 games before announcing that 
he would have season ending hip surgery in order to prepare for the 2013 
season.[40] Helton was healthier in 2013, playing in 124 games while hitting 
15 home runs with 61 RBIs. On September 14, 2013, Helton announced that 
he would be retiring at the conclusion of the 2013 season.[41] On September 
25, 2013, before his last game at Coors Field, Helton was honored by the 
Rockies Organization in a pre-game ceremony. In the game, Helton hit a 
home run and three RBI versus the Boston Red Sox. On Sunday, August 17, 
2014, the Rockies retired Helton's number 17 before a 2:05 pm day game 
at Coors Field. Helton is the first Rockies player to have his number retired 
in the team's twenty-one year history. Helton's jersey number, 17, is a 
tribute to former Chicago Cubs first baseman Mark Grace.[43] Helton and 
his family – wife Christy and daughters Gentry Grace and Tierney Faith 
– reside in Brighton, Colorado.[2] Helton and his family are good friends 
with Helton's former Tennessee Volunteers football teammate and former
