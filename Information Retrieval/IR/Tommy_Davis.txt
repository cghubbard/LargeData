Herman Thomas "Tommy" Davis, Jr. (born March 21, 1939) is an American former 
Major League Baseball left fielder and third baseman. He played from 1959–76 
for ten different teams, but he is best known for his years with the Los 
Angeles Dodgers when he was a two-time National League batting champion. 
During an 18-year baseball career, Davis batted .294 with 153 home runs, 
2,121 hits and 1,052 runs batted in. He was also one of the most proficient 
pinch-hitters in baseball history with a .320 batting average (63-for-197) 
– the highest in major league history upon his retirement, breaking the 
.312 mark of Frenchy Bordagaray. In 1962, he finished third in the MVP 
voting after leading the major leagues in batting average, hits and runs 
batted in. Davis' 153 RBIs in that season broke Roy Campanella's team record 
of 142 in 1953 and remain the franchise record; his 230 hits are the team 
record for a right-handed batter (second most in franchise history behind 
only Babe Herman's 241 in 1930), and his .346 average was the highest by 
a Dodger right-handed hitter in the 20th century until it was broken by 
Mike Piazza in 1997. Davis was born in Brooklyn, New York. He attended 
Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn, where he was a basketball teammate 
of future Basketball Hall of Famer Lenny Wilkens, as well as a long jumper 
on the school's track and field team with record breaker Bernard Lowther. 
In 1956, he was considering signing with the New York Yankees, but a phone 
call from Jackie Robinson convinced him to sign with the Brooklyn Dodgers 
instead.[1] In his minor league career, he won batting titles in the Midwest 
League and Pacific Coast League. By the time Davis made the majors, the 
Dodgers had moved to Los Angeles; he debuted with a pinch-hitting appearance 
on September 22, 1959. He batted .276 in his 1960 rookie season, and .278 
in 1961, before enjoying his breakout year in 1962 as the team moved into 
the new Dodger Stadium. His .346 batting average edged out Frank Robinson's 
.342 for the National League batting crown; he also had career bests with 
27 home runs, 120 runs and 9 triples as the Dodgers finished the regular 
schedule tied for first place with the San Francisco Giants, but lost a 
three-game playoff. He finished third in the MVP balloting, with teammate 
Maury Wills winning the award and Willie Mays finishing second. In 1963, 
Davis won his second batting title, edging Roberto Clemente by 6 points, 
and finished eighth in the MVP balloting. In the 1963 World Series, the 
Dodgers swept the New York Yankees; batting cleanup, Davis hit .400 in 
the Series, tripling twice in Game 2 and driving in the only run of the 
1-0 Game 3 victory, his first-inning single off Jim Bouton driving in Jim 
Gilliam. To date, Davis' back-to-back batting titles are the only two in 
the Dodgers' Los Angeles history. Only two right-handed hitters have won 
multiple National League batting titles since: Bill Madlock with four, 
and Roberto Clemente with four. Davis won the batting titles while playing 
his home games at Dodger Stadium—one of Major League Baseball's less hitter-friendly 
parks. Davis slumped to .275 in 1964 as the Dodgers finished out of contention 
for the pennant. On May 1, 1965, against the visiting Giants, he broke 
and dislocated his ankle sliding into second base while trying to break 
up a double play and was lost for the remainder of the season. Three days 
later the Dodgers called up Lou Johnson to replace him. They won the World 
Series that year, defeating the Minnesota Twins in seven games. Davis rebounded 
in 1966, batting .313 (but with only three home runs and 27 RBIs in 313 
at bats). Los Angeles was swept by the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series, 
with Davis starting only two of the four games and batting .250. After 
the 1966 World Series, Davis was traded to the New York Mets, along with 
Derrell Griffith, for Ron Hunt and Jim Hickman. After batting .302 with 
16 home runs and 73 RBIs in 1967 he was traded again, this time to the 
Chicago White Sox in a six-player deal, with the Mets acquiring Tommie 
Agee and Al Weis—two men who would play major roles in the Miracle Mets 
winning the 1969 World Series. In 1968, in what would become the "Year 
of the Pitcher", Davis led the White Sox in hitting with a .268 average–27 
points higher than the White Sox' co-leaders, Ken Berry and Don Buford, 
had hit in 1967. In October 1968 Davis was selected by the Seattle Pilots 
in the expansion draft. During the 1969 season he batted .271 in 123 games 
with the Pilots before being traded to the Houston Astros, where he hit 
.241; his 20 stolen bases that year were a career high. He began 1970 with 
Houston, hitting .282, before his contract was sold to the Oakland Athletics 
in June; he hit .290 with the A's before being sent to the Chicago Cubs 
for the last two weeks of the season. The Cubs released him in December, 
and he re-signed with the A's as a free agent, rebounding with a .324 campaign 
in 1971. But Oakland released him at the end of 1972 spring training; he 
signed with the Cubs again in July, but played only a month before being 
traded to the Baltimore Orioles, where he would spend the next three seasons. 
In Baltimore, he served as the designated hitter from 1973–75, finishing 
third in the 1973 batting race with a .306 mark and placing tenth in the 
MVP vote; in 1974 he was second in the American League with 181 hits. In 
1974 he won the Outstanding Designated Hitter Award (later renamed for 
Edgar Martínez). He played in two American League Championship Series (both 
times, in 1973 and 1974, the Orioles lost to the eventual World Series 
champion Athletics). The Orioles released him in 1976 spring training, 
and he signed with the Yankees but did not play for them. From June to 
September he hit .265 with the California Angels before ending the season 
with the Kansas City Royals. He retired after being released by the Royals 
on January 17, 1977, having played for ten different teams in eighteen 
seasons. He occasionally expressed resentment for his numerous moves, remarking 
late in his career: "I'm very bitter, bitter as hell. Why do I keep getting 
released? Don't ask me no reason why." But he conceded his reputation as 
having a casual style of play, noting, "the lazier I felt the better I 
hit", and admitting that he often went into the clubhouse to read and even 
to shave between at bats as a DH with Baltimore. After his retirement from
