"Out of left field" is American slang meaning "unexpectedly", "odd" or 
"strange". The phrase came from baseball terminology referring to the area 
covered by the left fielder who has the farthest throw to first base. According 
to mlb.com there is another meaning: "The term 'way out in left field' 
is taken to mean 'crazy.'" Cook County Hospital (by the West Side Grounds, 
the Chicago Cubs first location under what is now the University of Illinois 
at Chicago College of Medicine) had a mental institution behind left field, 
(...) The bottom line is, patients could be heard yelling and screaming 
things at fans behind the left field wall.'"[1] Variations include "out 
in left field" and simply "left field".[2] Popular music historian Arnold 
Shaw wrote in 1949 for the Music Library Association that the term "out 
of left field" was first used in the idiomatic sense of "from out of nowhere" 
by the music industry to refer to a song that unexpectedly performed well 
in the market.[3] Based on baseball lingo, a sentence such as "That was 
a hit out of left field" was used by song pluggers who promoted recordings 
and sheet music, to describe a song requiring no effort to sell.[3] A "rocking 
chair hit" was the kind of song which came "out of left field" and sold 
itself, allowing the song plugger to relax.[3] A 1943 article in Billboard 
magazine expands the use to describe people unexpectedly drawn to radio 
broadcasting: "Latest twist in radio linked with the war is the exceptional 
number of quasi-clerical groups and individuals who have come out of left 
field in recent months and are trying to buy, not promote, radio time."[4] 
Further instances of the phrase were published in the 1940s, including 
more times in Billboard magazine and once in a humor book titled How to 
Be Poor.[5][6][7] In May 1981, columnist William Safire asked readers of 
The New York Times to send him any ideas they had regarding the origin 
of the phrase "out of left field"—he did not know where it came from, and 
did not refer to Shaw's work.[8] On June 28, 1981, he devoted most of his 
Sunday column to the phrase, offering up various responses he received.[9][10] 
The earliest scholarly citation Safire could find was a 1961 article in 
the journal American Speech, which defined the variation "out in left field" 
as meaning "disoriented, out of contact with reality."[10][11] Linguist 
John Algeo told Safire that the phrase most likely came from baseball observers 
rather than from baseball fans or players.[12] In Safire's Political Dictionary, 
Safire writes that the phrase "out of left field" means "out of the ordinary, 
out of touch, far out."[13] The variation "out in left field" means alternately 
"removed from the ordinary, unconventional" or "out of contact with reality, 
out of touch."[13] He compares the term to left-wing politics and the Left 
Coast—slang for the liberal-leaning coastal cities in California, Oregon 
and Washington.[13] In 1998, American English professor Robert L. Chapman, 
in his book American Slang, wrote that the phrase "out of left field" was 
in use by 1953.[14] He did not cite Shaw's work and he did not point to 
printed instances of the phrase in the 1940s. Marcus Callies, an associate 
professor of English and philology at the University of Mainz in Germany, 
wrote that "the precise origin is unclear and disputed", referring to Christine 
Ammer's conclusion in The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms.[15] Callies 
suggested that the left fielder in baseball might throw the ball to home 
plate in an effort to get the runner out before he scores, and that the 
ball, coming from behind the runner out of left field, would surprise the 
runner.[15] From the Way Out In Left Field Society: "The phrase "way out 
in left field" has evolved to mean an eccentric, odd, misguided or peculiar 
statement or act. Although the origin of the phrase has been challenged 
and debated over the years, the most logical and realistic explanation 
comes from an extinct baseball park called West Side Grounds that the Chicago 
Cubs called home from 1893 to 1915. As legend has it, a mental hospital 
called the Neuropsychiatric Institute was located directly behind the left 
field wall. The Institute housed mental patients who could be heard making 
strange and bizarre comments within listening distance of players and fans. 
Thus, if someone said that you were "way out in left field," the person 
was questioning your sanity and comparing you with a mental patient"[16][17]
