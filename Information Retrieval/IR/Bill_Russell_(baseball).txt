As player As manager William Ellis Russell (born October 21, 1948) is a 
former shortstop, coach and manager in Major League Baseball. Russell played 
his entire 18-year, 2,181-game career with the Los Angeles Dodgers as the 
starting shortstop for four National League pennant winners and one World 
Series championship team. He also served as the team's manager from 1996 
to 1998. A right-handed batter and thrower, Russell came to the Dodgers 
as a 20-year-old outfielder in 1969, and his first two MLB seasons were 
spent in the outfield (veteran Maury Wills was the Dodger shortstop). During 
the 1970–71 offseason, Russell was converted to a second baseman, and then 
– the following year – to shortstop, becoming a regular in 1972. Russell 
was the club's everyday shortstop for the next eleven years, anchoring 
an infield that included third baseman Ron Cey, second baseman Davey Lopes 
and first baseman Steve Garvey. This infield crew has the distinction of 
being the longest intact unit in baseball history with eight and a half 
seasons together. Russell batted .263 over his regular season career, and 
– coincidentally – posted the same average in 23 World Series games in 
1974, 1977, 1978, and 1981. Russell's finest Fall Classic was in 1978, 
when he garnered 11 hits and batted .423 in a losing effort against the 
New York Yankees. He also hit .337 over five National League Championship 
Series. Russell wore number 18. Russell was hit in the hand with a pitch 
in September 1980 by Mike Lacoss of the Cincinnati Reds, shattering his 
right forefinger. He had the finger surgically repaired but was never really 
the same player afterward and retired in October 1986. Only Zack Wheat 
played more games as a Dodger and no one in the West Coast portion of Dodgers 
history has played more games. He played shortstop exclusively from 1974–1983 
and alternated playing time at second base, shortstop and the outfield 
for his final three seasons. Russell became a coach on manager Tommy Lasorda's 
staff in 1987. In 1992–93, he piloted the Dodgers' AAA farm club, the Albuquerque 
Dukes of the Pacific Coast League, but posted losing records each season. 
He then rejoined Lasorda and the Los Angeles coaching staff in 1994 and 
was considered by many the heir apparent to Lasorda's job. In June 1996, 
the 68-year-old skipper suffered a mild heart attack and Russell was named 
acting manager. Although Lasorda's health recovered, the Dodger front office 
decided to make Russell's appointment permanent on July 29, thus making 
him only the third man to manage the Dodgers in 43 years. Russell finished 
the 1996 season, compiling a record of 49-37 and bringing the Dodgers home 
in second place, earning the NL wild card spot in the playoffs before being 
swept in three games by the Atlanta Braves in the Division Series. The 
following year, he directed the Dodgers to an 88-74 mark and another runner-up 
finish in the NL West. However, when the 1998 club stumbled to a 36–38 
start – and with the News Corporation poised to buy the team – Russell 
was fired on June 21 along with general manager Fred Claire in a general 
housecleaning, ending a 30-year association with the team. His final managing 
record was 173–149 (.537). His departure from the Dodgers followed the 
new ownership's decision to trade Mike Piazza along with third baseman 
Todd Zeile to the Florida Marlins. Neither Russell nor Claire knew about 
the trade. Claire, who like Russell had been with the Dodgers in various 
capacities since 1969, discussed his and Russell's ouster in his book My 
30 Years in Dodger Blue. Russell went on to coach for the Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays and managed farm teams of both Tampa Bay and the San Francisco Giants, 
the Dodgers' archrival. He currently works for Major League Baseball's
