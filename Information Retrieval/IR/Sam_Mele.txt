Sabath Anthony "Sam" Mele (born January 21, 1922) is a former right fielder, 
manager, coach and scout in Major League Baseball. As a manager, he led 
the Minnesota Twins to their first American League championship in 1965.[1] 
Mele was the nephew of major league baseball players Tony and Al Cuccinello, 
but did not play baseball until he attended William Cullen Bryant High 
School. The high school gave up baseball after his freshman year, but Mele 
played with other local baseball teams. Mentored by his uncle Tony, Mele 
gained major league attention and worked out with several teams while still 
in high school. After high school, Mele attended New York University. In 
1940, he broke his leg sliding into third base but, in 1941, he posted 
a batting average of .405, and in 1942, he hit .369. He also excelled as 
a basketball player. NYU basketball head coach Howard Cann called Mele 
one of the finest players he ever coached. In the summer of 1941, Mele 
also played baseball for the Burlington, Vermont team of the Northern League 
where he made contact with the Boston Red Sox and signed a five-figure 
contract. But before he could join the Sox, he first signed up for the 
United States Marine Corps in 1942 and was called in July 1943. As part 
of the V-12 Navy College Training Program, Mele played baseball for Red 
Rolfe at Yale University. He was sent to the Pacific Ocean where he was 
able to play baseball with Joe DiMaggio and others. Mele led the Navy league 
with a .358 average in 1944. In 1946, after the Marines, Mele joined the 
Red Sox in Sarasota, Florida before being sent to the Louisville Colonels 
and, later, the Eastern League Scranton Red Sox. Mele won the Eastern League 
Most Valuable Player award, leading the league in average (.342), total 
bases and triples. The following year, the Boston Red Sox went into spring 
with uncertainty at the right field position, but Mele won the job with 
a 5-for-5 performance, and hit .302 for the season. He also substituted 
well in center field when Dom DiMaggio was injured.[2] During his playing 
days (1947–56), Mele saw duty with six major league clubs: the Boston Red 
Sox, Washington Senators, Chicago White Sox, Baltimore Orioles, Cincinnati 
Reds and Cleveland Indians, batting .267 with 80 home runs in 1,046 games. 
He batted and threw right-handed.[1] Along the way, he acquired the nickname 
"Sam" from his initials.[3] Immediately after his playing career ended 
in the minor leagues in 1958, Mele became a scout for the Washington Senators. 
But in 1959, on July 4, Mele joined the Major League coaching staff of 
the Senators under manager Cookie Lavagetto when Billy Jurges departed 
to become skipper of the Red Sox.[4] He followed the franchise when it 
moved to Bloomington, Minnesota, as the Minnesota Twins in 1961. With the 
maiden edition of the Twins struggling at 19–30 (.388) on June 6, 1961, 
Mele filled in as manager, winning two of seven games while Lavagetto took 
a leave of absence. Mele then formally succeeded to the job on June 23, 
1961. The Twins moved up two places in the standings under Mele, going 
45–49 (.479) and finishing seventh.[1] But fortified by young players such 
as Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew, Jim Kaat, Zoilo Versalles and Bob Allison, 
the Twins challenged the powerful New York Yankees in 1962 before placing 
second. After finishing third in 1963, the team suffered through a poor 
season in 1964,[1] leading to speculation that Mele would be replaced by 
his new third base coach, Billy Martin. Instead, Mele's 1965 Twins broke 
the Yankees' stranglehold on the American League pennant, as from 1947 
to 1964, the Yankees had won all but three pennants. Led by Versalles, 
who was named the American League's Most Valuable Player, batting champion 
Tony Oliva, and pitcher Mudcat Grant, who won 21 games, Minnesota won 102 
games—still a franchise record—and coasted to the league title. (The Yankees 
finished sixth.) Minnesota won the first two games in the 1965 World Series, 
but the superior pitching of the Los Angeles Dodgers' Sandy Koufax, Don 
Drysdale and Claude Osteen asserted itself as Los Angeles won in seven 
games.[1] The 1966 Twins won 13 fewer games, and finished runners-up to 
the Baltimore Orioles.[1] Mele also became embroiled in a clash between 
two of his coaches, Martin and pitching tutor Johnny Sain,[5] which was 
later described by Martin as Sain's efforts to try to get Mele fired.[6] 
His action (or inaction) alienated him from some of the players.[7] The 
club swung a major trade for pitcher Dean Chance during the offseason and 
unveiled star rookie Rod Carew in 1967. Expectations were high in Minnesota, 
but when the Twins were only .500 after 50 games, Mele was fired. His successor 
was not Martin, as had been anticipated, but longtime minor league manager 
Cal Ermer.[1] Mele's record as a manager was 524–436 (.546).[8] He never 
managed again at any level in baseball, but returned to the Red Sox, where 
he served as a special assignments scout from the midseason of 1967 until
