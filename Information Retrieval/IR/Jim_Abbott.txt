James Anthony Abbott (born September 19, 1967) is a retired Major League 
Baseball pitcher, who played despite having been born without a right hand. 
He played 10 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the California 
Angels, New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox, and Milwaukee Brewers, from 
1989 to 1999. He graduated from Flint Central High School and grew up in 
the East Village area of Flint, Michigan. While with the University of 
Michigan, Abbott won the James E. Sullivan Award as the nation's best amateur 
athlete in 1987 and won a gold medal in the demonstration event at the 
1988 Summer Olympics. He was drafted in the first round of the 1988 MLB 
draft and reached the major leagues the next year. As a member of the Yankees, 
he threw a no-hitter against the Cleveland Indians in 1993.[1] Abbott retired 
with a career record of 87 wins and 108 losses, along with a 4.25 earned 
run average. He currently works as a motivational speaker.[2][3] Abbott 
was born in Flint, Michigan.[4] He was picked up by the Ypsilanti, Michigan 
American Legion team and went on to win the championship. He graduated 
from Flint Central High School in Michigan where he was a stand-out pitcher 
and quarterback.[5] He played for the Grossi Baseball Club during the summer 
in the Connie Mack leagues of Michigan. He was drafted in the 36th round 
by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1985 Major League Baseball draft but did 
not sign, instead moving on to the University of Michigan. He played for 
Michigan three years under coach Bud Middaugh, from 1985 to 1988, leading 
them to two Big Ten championships. In 1987, he won the James E. Sullivan 
Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States, becoming the first 
baseball player to win the award.[1][4] Abbott was the flag-bearer for 
the United States at the 1987 Pan American Games in Indianapolis, helping 
lead the USA to a second-place finish.[4][6] Baseball was a demonstration 
sport in the 1988 Summer Olympics; Abbott pitched the final game, winning 
an unofficial gold medal for the United States.[4] Abbott was voted the 
Big Ten Athlete of the Year in 1988. He would be selected 8th overall by 
the California Angels in the 1988 draft. Abbott's University of Michigan 
#31 jersey was retired at the Wolverines' April 18, 2009 home game against 
Michigan State University. [4] In 2007, Abbott was elected to the College 
Baseball Hall of Fame for his career at Michigan. In 1989, Abbott joined 
the California Angels' starting rotation as a rookie without playing a 
single minor league game. That season, he posted a 12-12 record with an 
ERA of 3.92,[4] and finished fifth in the year's American League Rookie 
of the Year Award voting. In 1991, Abbott won 18 games with the Angels 
while posting an ERA of 2.89, finishing third in the American League Cy 
Young Award voting.[4] In the 1992 season, he posted a 2.77 ERA, but his 
win-loss record fell to 7-15 for the sixth-place Angels.[4] Abbott also 
won the Tony Conigliaro Award in 1992. On September 4, 1993 while pitching 
for the New York Yankees, Abbott pitched a no-hitter against the Cleveland 
Indians.[4] In 1994, Abbott's Yankees led the American League East, but 
the season halted, and the playoffs were canceled, due to a players strike 
on August 12. The following year, after starting the season with the Chicago 
White Sox, he returned to the California Angels, who held an 11-game lead 
over the Seattle Mariners in August, but lost the American League West 
in a one-game playoff to the Mariners. He struggled through the 1996 season, 
posting a 2–18 record with a 7.48 ERA and briefly retired. Abbott returned 
to the White Sox in 1998, starting five games and winning all five. Abbott 
continued his comeback the following year with the Milwaukee Brewers, but 
pitched ineffectively. This was the first time he'd played for a National 
League team, forcing him to bat for the first time in his career. He recorded 
two hits in 21 at-bats during his Brewers stint. Abbott retired after the 
1999 season with a career record of 87–108, with a 4.25 ERA. When preparing 
to pitch the ball, Abbott would rest his mitt on the end of his right forearm. 
After releasing the ball, he would quickly slip his hand into the mitt, 
usually in time to field any balls that a two-handed pitcher would be able 
to field. Then he would secure the mitt between his right forearm and torso, 
slip his hand out of the mitt, and remove the ball from the mitt, usually 
in time to throw out the runner at first or sometimes even start a double 
play. At all levels, teams tried to exploit his fielding disadvantage by 
repeatedly bunting to him; however, this tactic was never effective.[7] 
Batting was not an issue for Abbott for the majority of his career, since 
the American League uses the designated hitter, and he played only two 
seasons in the interleague play era. But Abbott tripled in a spring training 
game in 1991 off Rick Reuschel,[8] and when Abbott joined the National 
League's Milwaukee Brewers in 1999, he had two hits in 21 at-bats, both 
off Jon Lieber.[9][10] New York Yankees teammate Mariano Rivera claimed 
to have witnessed Abbott hitting home runs during batting practice.[11] 
In April 2012, Abbott's autobiography, Imperfect: An Improbable Life (ISBN 
0345523253), co-written with Tim Brown, was published by Ballantine Books.[14]
