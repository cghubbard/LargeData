McKeesport is a city in Allegheny County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania; 
it is situated at the confluence of the Monongahela and Youghiogheny rivers 
and is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The population was 19,731 
at the 2010 census.[1] By population, it is Allegheny County's second-largest 
city, after Pittsburgh. Settled in 1795 and named in honor of John McKee, 
its founder, McKeesport remained a village until 1830 when coal mining 
began in the region. Large deposits of bituminous coal existed. McKeesport 
was incorporated as a borough in 1842 and as a city in 1891. Its population 
grew steadily until the mid-20th century, when it peaked in the 1940s. 
The city's population in 1900 was 34,227; in 1910, 42,694; in 1920, 45,975; 
and in 1940, 55,355. The decrease in the population since the 1940s is 
attributable to the general economic malaise that descended upon the region 
when the steelmaking industry moved elsewhere. The major employer was the 
National Tube Works, a manufacturer of iron pipes, which once employed 
10,000 men. McKeesport was the site of the first G. C. Murphy five-and-ten-cent 
store. John McKee, an original settler of Philadelphia and son of David 
McKee, built a log cabin near the confluence of the Monongahela and Youghiogheny 
rivers, the site of present-day McKeesport. After taking over his father's 
local river ferry business, he devised a plan for a city to be called McKee's 
Port. John set out his proposal in the Pittsburgh Gazette, as part of a 
program under which new residents could purchase plots of land for $20.00 
(a lottery was used to distribute the plots to avoid complaints from new 
land owners concerning "inferior" locations). Around the time of the French 
and Indian Wars, George Washington often came to McKeesport to visit his 
friend, Queen Alliquippa, a Seneca Indian ruler. After being settled by 
the McKee family in 1795, McKeesport began to grow in 1830 when coal mining 
began. The first schoolhouse was built in 1832, with James E. Huey as its 
schoolmaster (Huey Street in McKeesport is named for him). The city's first 
steel mill was established in 1851. The National Tube Company opened in 
1872 and became part of U.S. Steel. In the years directly following the 
opening of the National Tube Company, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 
McKeesport was the fastest growing municipality in the nation.[2] Families 
arrived from other parts of the eastern United States, Italy, Germany, 
Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, with most working at the National 
Tube Company. McKeesport rose to national importance during the 1900s as 
a center for manufacturing steel. The city's population reached a peak 
of 55,355 in 1940 National Tube closed in the 1980s, along with other U.S. 
Steel plants in the Mon Valley. The city with the help of regional development 
agencies has conducted efforts to revitalize the former mill sites.[3][4] 
Thirteen years before both faced off in some of the most memorable televised 
Presidential debates, future presidents (and contemporary U.S. Representatives) 
Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy met in McKeesport for their first 
of five debates on April 22, 1947, to debate labor issues.[5] McKeesport
