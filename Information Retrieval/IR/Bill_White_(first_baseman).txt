William De Kova "Bill" White (born January 28, 1934 in Lakewood, Florida) 
is a former professional baseball first baseman who played for the New 
York and San Francisco Giants (1956, 1958), St. Louis Cardinals (1959–65, 
1969) and Philadelphia Phillies (1966–68). In 1989 White was elected President 
of the National League to replace Bart Giamatti, who succeeded Peter Ueberroth 
as Commissioner. White served as NL president until he retired in 1994. 
White became a full-time sportscaster after his playing career ended in 
1969, and was the play-by-play man and color analyst for New York Yankees 
television and radio broadcasts for 18 years. As a minor-leaguer, White 
was the second black player to play for a Carolina League team – the Danville 
Leafs (1953). Percy Miller Jr. broke the color barrier for that league 
in 1951. In his 13-season major league career, White batted .286 with 202 
home runs and 870 RBIs in 1673 games. He was also one of the top defensive 
first basemen of his time, winning seven straight Gold Glove Awards (1960–66). 
White batted and threw left-handed. White is also one of the few MLB players 
who have hit at least .300 and driven in at least 100 runs in three consecutive 
seasons. White earned a sports program on KMOX radio in St. Louis while 
he was still playing for the Cardinals. After he was traded to the Phillies, 
he did a program there. After ending his playing career White became a 
sportscaster for WFIL-TV (now WPVI-TV) in Philadelphia. While in Philadelphia, 
White became the first African-American to broadcast National Hockey League 
games when he called several games of the Philadelphia Flyers.[citation

Yankee games from 1971 to 1988, most often teamed with Phil Rizzuto and 
Frank Messer. He did the team's broadcasts on both radio and television 
during most of that stretch. White was the first African-American to do 
play-by-play regularly for a major-league sports team.[citation needed] 
On New York City radio, White was featured on WMCA from 1971 to 1977, after 
which the Yankees switched over to WINS. In 1981, the Yankee broadcast 
team moved over to WABC. On television, White worked with Rizzuto and Messer 
on WPIX.[citation needed] Nationally, White helped call several World Series 
and American League Championship Series for CBS Radio (including the Yankees' 
World Series appearances in 1976, 1977, and 1978) and did sports reports 
for the network. White worked as a Monday Night Baseball announcer for 
ABC television in the late 1970s. He also did pre-game reports for ABC's 
coverage of the Yankee Stadium games in the 1977 World Series, and handled 
the post-game trophy presentation for the network after the Yanks clinched 
the world title in the sixth game. WPIX and its usual Rizzuto-Messer-White 
broadcast trifecta carried the ALCS in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1980 and 1981, 
providing New York viewers a local alternative to the nationally-broadcast 
telecasts.[citation needed] White was elected to replace Giamatti as NL 
president in 1989 in a unanimous vote becoming the first African-American 
to hold such a high executive position in sports.[1] He served as NL president 
through 1994. In 2011, White released his autobiography entitled Uppity: 
My Untold Story About the Games People Play.[2][3][4][5] Bill White currently
