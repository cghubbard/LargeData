Lee is a town in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, United States settled 
by. It is part of the Pittsfield, Massachusetts, metropolitan statistical 
area. The population was 5,943 at the 2010 census.[1] Lee, which includes 
the villages of South and East Lee, is part of the Berkshires resort area. 
Lee occupies land which was originally territory of Mahican Indians. The 
first non-native settlement in the area was known as Dodgetown as early 
as 1760. Dodgetown was named after its founding settler, Asahel Dodge, 
who immigrated to the area from Cape Cod. Lee was incorporated in 1777 
from parts of Great Barrington and Washington. It is named after Revolutionary 
War General Charles Lee.[2] Lee is a former mill town. In the autumn of 
1786 during Shays' Rebellion, about 250 followers of Daniel Shays encountered 
state troops commanded by General John Paterson near East Lee. The Shaysites 
paraded a fake cannon crafted from a yarn beam, and the troops fled. Early 
industries included agriculture, lumbering, and lime making. Abundant streams 
and rivers provided water power for mills which produced textiles and wire. 
In 1806, papermaking became the principal industry with the construction 
of the Willow Mill by Samuel Church in South Lee. In 1827, the Columbia 
Mill in central Lee was established, and would eventually be the first 
to supply 100% groundwood newsprint to The New York Times. By 1857, there 
were 25 paper mills in Lee. The Smith Paper Company discovered how to manufacture 
paper solely from wood pulp in 1867, and through the 1870s was the largest 
producer of paper in the country. The mills previously owned by Smith Paper 
Company were closed in 2008.[3] Today, Lee has only a single papermaking 
facility. The town's marble is famous for its quality. The first quarry 
was established in 1852. In 1867, almost 500,000 cubic feet (14,000 m3) 
of marble was excavated and shipped on the Housatonic Railroad. Buildings 
constructed of Lee marble include a wing of the Capitol in Washington and 
St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. The town's 19th century prosperity 
is still evident in its architecture, including its town hall, library, 
several churches and private homes. South Lee includes a historic district 
listed on the National Register. Lee has become a popular tourist destination, 
noted both for its New England charm and its bed and breakfast establishments. 
It is known as the "Gateway to The Berkshires" because it provides one 
of only two exits on the Massachusetts Turnpike which serve the county, 
and the only one going eastbound. Arlo Guthrie's court appearance before 
the blind judge and his seeing-eye dog for dumping garbage as noted in 
the song "Alice's Restaurant" took place in the courtroom at the Lee town
