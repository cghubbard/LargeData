The 1951 Brooklyn Dodgers led the National League for much of the season, 
holding a 13-game lead as late as August. However, a late season swoon 
and a hot streak by the New York Giants led to a classic three-game playoff 
series. Bobby Thomson's dramatic ninth-inning home run off Dodger reliever 
Ralph Branca in the final game won the pennant for the Giants and was immortalized 
as the Shot Heard 'Round the World. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders

the more famous episodes in major league baseball history, and possibly 
one of the greatest moments in sports history, the "Shot Heard 'Round the 
World" is the name given to Bobby Thomson's walk-off home run that clinched 
the National League pennant for the New York Giants over their rivals, 
the Brooklyn Dodgers. This game was the third of a three-game playoff series 
resulting from one of baseball's most memorable pennant races. The Giants 
had been thirteen and a half games behind the league-leading Dodgers in 
August, but under Durocher's guidance and with the aid of a sixteen-game 
winning streak, caught the Dodgers to tie for the lead on the last day
