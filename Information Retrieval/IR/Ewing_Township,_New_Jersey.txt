Ewing Township is a township in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. 
The township is within the New York metropolitan area as defined by the 
United States Census Bureau.[21] It also directly borders the Philadelphia 
metropolitan area and is part of the Federal Communications Commission's 
Philadelphia Designated Market Area.[22] As of the 2010 United States Census, 
the township's population was 35,790,[10][11][12] reflecting an increase 
of 83 (+0.2%) from the 35,707 counted in the 2000 Census, which had increased 
by 1,522 (+4.5%) from the 34,185 counted in the 1990 Census.[23] The earliest 
inhabitants of present-day Ewing Township in the historic era were Lenni 
Lenape Native Americans, who lived along the banks of the Delaware River. 
Their pre-colonial subsistence activities in the area included hunting, 
fishing, pottery-making, and simple farming. Europeans, mostly from the 
British Isles, began to colonize the area in the 17th and 18th centuries. 
One of the earliest European settlers was William Green, and his 1717 farmhouse 
still stands on the campus of The College of New Jersey.[24] The area that 
is now Ewing Township was part of Hopewell Township in what was a very 
large Burlington County at the beginning of the 18th century. In 1714 Hopewell 
was removed from Burlington County and added to Hunterdon County.[25][26] 
By 1719, the area which was to become Ewing Township had been removed from 
Hopewell Township and added to the newly created Trenton Township.[27] 
Portions of Trenton Township were incorporated as Ewing Township by an 
act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 22, 1834, posthumously honoring 
Charles Ewing for his work as Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court.[28] 
The township became part of the newly created Mercer County on February 
22, 1838. After incorporation, Ewing Township received additional territory 
taken from Lawrence Township and the city of Trenton in 1858. In 1894 the 
city of Trenton took back some of that territory, annexing more in 1900.[29] 
When Ewing Township was incorporated in the 19th century, it was primarily 
farmland with a handful of scattered hamlets, including Carleton (now known 
as Ewing), Cross Keys (now known as Ewingville), Birmingham (now known 
as West Trenton) and Greensburg (now known as Wilburtha).[30] Since the 
beginning of the 20th century, the township has developed as a suburb of 
Trenton. The sections near the city border are distinctly urban, but most 
of the township is suburban and rural residential development. The main 
commercial district extends along North Olden Avenue Extension (County 
Route 622), originally constructed to connect north Trenton residences 
with the now-closed General Motors Inland Fisher Guide Plant. Ewing Township 
today is the location of The College of New Jersey, the Community Blood 
Council of New Jersey, New Jersey State Police headquarters, the Jones 
Farm State Correction Institute, the Trenton Psychiatric Hospital, the 
New Jersey Department of Transportation headquarters, the Katzenbach School 
for the Deaf and Trenton-Mercer Airport. From 1953 until 1997 Ewing was 
the home of Naval Air Warfare Center Trenton, encompassing 528 acres (214 ha) 
on Parkway Avenue.[31] It was used as a jet engine test facility for the 
US Navy until its closure based on the recommendations of the 1993 Base 
Closure and Realignment Commission.[31] Nearly 700 civilian positions were 
eliminated, most of which were relocated to other facilities in Maryland 
and Tennessee.[32] The base's Marine operations were transferred to Fort 
Dix, which has since become Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.[33] A charity 
to end homelessness acquired the base at no cost in October 2013 in a process 
involving the United States Department of Defense, the United States Department 
of Housing and Urban Development, Mercer County and Ewing Township.[33] 
The first location of an industrial robot used to replace human workers 
was at Ewing's Inland Fisher Guide Plant in 1961, a facility that operated 
in the township for 1938 to 1998, after which the plant was demolished 
and targeted for redevelopment.[34][35][36] According to the United States 
Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 15.599 square miles (40.400 km2), 
including 15.250 square miles (39.497 km2) of land and 0.349 square miles 
(0.903 km2) of water (2.23%).[1][2] The highest elevation in Ewing Township 
is 225 feet (69 m) AMSL just east of Interstate 95 and just west of Trenton-Mercer 
Airport,[37] while the lowest point is just below 20 feet (6.1 m) AMSL 
along the Delaware River near the border with Trenton.[38] The largest 
body of water completely within the township is Lake Sylva,[39] a man-made 
lake that was created in the 1920s when an earthen dam was constructed 
across the Shabakunk Creek. The 11-acre (4.5 ha) lake is located on the 
campus of The College of New Jersey.[40] Water courses in Ewing include 
the Delaware River along its western boundary and the Shabakunk Creek in 
the eastern and central portions of the township. Within the township are 
a number of distinct neighborhoods. These include Agasote,[41] Altura,[42] 
Arbor Walk,[43] Braeburn Heights,[43][44][45] Briarcrest,[43][46][47] Briarwood,[43][48][49]

these existed before suburbanization, while others came into existence 
with the suburban development of the township in the 20th century. At the

Pharmaceuticals established an office presence in Ewing.[110] Ewing's decommissioned 
Marine Reserve Center will be the headquarters of HomeFront, a charity 
dedicated to ending homelessness in the Mercer region, with construction 
starting summer 2014, including a shelter, job training and literacy programs, 
day care, computer rooms and a teaching kitchen.[33] Ewing Township is 
governed under the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal 
Charter Law, within Mayor-Council plan 2 form of New Jersey municipal government, 
as implemented as of January 1, 1995, based on the recommendations of a 
Charter Study Commission.[111] The Governing Body of the township consists 
of five Council members and a Mayor, all of whom are elected by the voters 
of the community. The Mayor and Members of the Council are elected at-large 
to four-year terms of office, with either three seats up for election or 
two seats and the mayoral seat every other year.[8][112] As of 2016[update],

by a County Executive who oversees the day-to-day operations of the county 
and by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders that acts in a legislative 
capacity, setting policy. All officials are chosen at-large in partisan 
elections, with the executive serving a four-year term of office while 
the freeholders serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, 
with either two or three seats up for election each year.[129] As of 2014[update],

The Ewing Township Board of Education oversees the Ewing Public Schools. 
As of the 2011-12 school year, the district's five schools had an enrollment 
of 3,704 students and 302.7 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a 
student–teacher ratio of 12.24:1.[153] Schools in the district (with 2011-12 
enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics[154]) 
are three K-5 elementary schools — W. L. Antheil Elementary School[155] 
(670 students; in grades PreK-5), Francis Lore Elementary School[156] (516; 
K-5) and Parkway Elementary School[157] (465; K-5) — Gilmore J. Fisher 
Middle School[158] (929) for grades 6-8 and Ewing High School[159] (1,124) 
for grades 9-12.[160][161] A court case filed in 1946 challenged a policy 
of the Ewing Public Schools under which the district provided bus transportation 
to students living in the districts who attended private parochial schools. 
In Everson v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court of the United States 
ruled for the first time that state and local government were subject to 
the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, 
but that it had not been violated in this instance.[162] The Ewing Public 
Education Foundation, established in 1995, is an independent, not-for-profit 
citizen's organization whose mission is to mobilize community support, 
concern, commitment and resources to help improve the quality of education 
in Ewing Township. EPEF provides grants to Ewing Township Schools for innovative 
educational programs through fund-raising activities, and corporate and 
institutional sponsorship. The Foundation also seeks to match corporate 
and organizational donors with teachers to fund additional projects of 
mutual interest. These programs enhance the educational experience without 
the use of additional taxpayer dollars.[163] The Mercer County Vocational 
School District's Thomas J. Rubino Academy (formerly Mercer County Alternative 
High School) is one of Mercer County's only alternative schools, offering 
an alternative educational program for students who have struggled in the 
traditional school environment, featuring smaller classes, mentoring and 
counseling.[164] The Marie H. Katzenbach campus of the New Jersey School 
for the Deaf serves 175 hearing-impaired students on a campus covering 
148 acres (60 ha) that was opened in West Trenton in 1926.[165][166] The 
school was established in Ewing through the efforts of Marie Hilson Katzenbach 
and was renamed in her honor in 1965.[167] Incarnation-St. James Catholic 
School (formerly Incarnation School), constructed in 1955, is a Pre-K to 
8th grade parish school administered by The Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate 
Heart of Mary and overseen by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Trenton.[168] 
The school added a parish center in 2003, which includes a gym, locker 
rooms, offices, meeting rooms, boiler room, and a kitchenette to be used 
to the benefit of its students, faculty, and staff. In 2006, the Incarnation 
School and parish combined with the St. James School and parish.[169] The 
Villa Victoria Academy is a private Catholic school in Ewing Township, 
christened as a private academy in 1933, and operated by the Religious 
Teachers Filippini. This single-gender school offers an education to young 
women from pre-Kindergarten to twelfth grade.[170] The College of New Jersey 
(formerly Trenton State College) is located on a campus covering 289 acres 
(117 ha) within the township.[171] Ewing Township is traversed by multiple 
main roadways, as well as by a passenger rail line and is the location 
of an airport. As of May 2010[update], the township had a total of 149.74 
miles (240.98 km) of roadways, of which 108.73 miles (174.98 km) were maintained 
by the municipality, 28.16 miles (45.32 km) by Mercer County, 12.65 miles 
(20.36 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation, which also has 
its headquarters in Ewing, and 0.20 miles (0.32 km) by the Delaware River 
Joint Toll Bridge Commission.[172] Interstate 95 (the Scudder Falls Freeway 
and Bridge) crosses the northwestern section of the township. It is a 55 
to 65 miles per hour (89 to 105 km/h), 4-6 lane divided freeway facility. 
It was constructed as a 4-lane facility in the 1960s, and widened to 6 
lanes in the 1990s, with the exception of the Scudder Falls Bridge over 
the Delaware River. It connects south with Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and 
connects north to U.S. 1, where this branch of Interstate 95 ends and becomes 
Interstate 295. From there, travelers use U.S. 1 or Interstate 195 and 
the New Jersey Turnpike to reach the next major destination northwards, 
New York City. The Ewing portion of Interstate 95 will eventually be redesignated 
as Interstate 295 when a direct interchange between Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania 
and the Pennsylvania Turnpike is completed,[173] re-routing Interstate 
95 onto the New Jersey Turnpike at Exit 6 (in Mansfield Township). U.S. 
Route 206 (Princeton Avenue) skirts the southeastern section of the township. 
It is a 25 miles per hour (40 km/h), undivided four-lane[174] facility. 
Although part of US 206, it is actually maintained by the Mercer County 
Department of Transportation as part of County Route 583, which is co-signed 
with US 206. US 206 also connects south to Trenton, and connects north 
to Princeton and Somerville. Route 29 (Daniel Bray Highway and River Road) 
extends north-south along the western edge of the township, along the Delaware 
River. The southern section, Daniel Bray Highway, is a 55 mph (90 km/h), 
divided four-lane facility with at-grade intersections and traffic lights, 
and was constructed in the 1950s. The northern section, River Road, is 
a 45 mph (70 km/h), undivided two-lane facility whose construction as a 
state highway dates from the 1930s. NJ 29 connects southwards to Trenton, 
and northwards to Lambertville and Frenchtown. The entire section of Route 
29 in Ewing is designated the Delaware River Scenic Byway, a National Scenic 
Byway. Route 175 serves as a frontage road along the divided portion of 
Route 29. Route 31 (Pennington Road) extends north-south towards the eastern 
side of the township. It is a 35-45 mph (60–70 km/h), undivided four-lane 
facility whose construction as a state highway also dates to the 1930s. 
It once also carried a trolley line, but it has long since been removed. 
It was once proposed to be bypassed by a freeway, but this plan has since 
been cancelled. NJ 31 also connects south to Trenton, and connects north 
to Pennington, Flemington, and Clinton. The West Trenton Station is at 
the terminus of SEPTA's West Trenton Line. This commuter rail facility 
mainly serves commuter traffic to and from Philadelphia. New Jersey Transit 
has proposed a new West Trenton Line of its own, that would stretch for 
27 miles (43 km) from the West Trenton Station to a connection with the 
Raritan Valley Line at Bridgewater Township, and from there to Newark Penn 
Station in Newark.[175][176] Ewing Township is the site of the Trenton-Mercer 
Airport (TTN), which first opened in 1929 and is one of three commercial 
airports in the state. The airport has 100,000 takeoffs and landings annually, 
and is served by Frontier Airlines, which offers nonstop service to and 
from 10 different locations nationwide.[177] Ewing Township is also traversed 
by the Delaware and Raritan Canal near the Delaware River. Originally important 
to commerce and trade, the advent of railroads caused the canal's commercial 
demise. The strip of land along the canal is currently part of the Delaware 
and Raritan Canal State Park. New Jersey Transit provides service between 
the township and Trenton on the 601, 602, 607, 608 and 609 routes.[178]
