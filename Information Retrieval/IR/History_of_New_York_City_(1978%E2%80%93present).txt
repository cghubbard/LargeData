The history of New York City (1978–present) has seen a cycle of modest 
boom and a bust in the 1980s, a major boom in the 1990s, and mixed prospects 
since then. This period has seen severe racial tension, a dramatic spike 
and fall of crime rates, and a major influx of immigrants growing the city's 
population past the eight million mark. The September 11 attacks on the 
World Trade Center in 2001 had a lasting impact on the city that continues 
to reverberate to the present. Compared to the 1970s, the 1980s were a 
time of restrained optimism in New York. The boom on Wall Street was fueling 
the speculative real estate market, and unemployment numbers dropped noticeably, 
however, the city's reputation for crime and disorder was still very much 
a part of New Yorkers' daily lives.[1][2][3] Mayor Ed Koch repeatedly warned 
that filth, crime, and racial tensions were weakening the city. He put 
a high priority on rebuilding neighborhoods and infrastructure. One result 
was that gentrification brought new businesses to decrepit neighborhoods 
corners and converted low-end rental housing to co-ops and condos that 
attracted young upscale professionals and business people. Koch's energetic 
efforts brought enormous attention from the media, but critics condemned 
his attacks on his opponents as "crazy," "wackos," and "radicals" and alleged 
he was racially divisive.[4] For years enormous attention followed the 
criminal trials resulted when a woman known as the Central Park Jogger 
was badly beaten and raped.[5] The illegal drug trade flourished, causing 
the murder rate to soar, and dividing the city into areas ruled by different 
drug lords. It became known as the crack epidemic.[6] The New York City 
Subway fell victim to a crime epidemic that saw more crimes being committed 
on the subway each year than in any other subway system around the world.[7] 
Homelessness became a serious problem during the 1980s,[8] specifically 
in the last two of Edward Koch's three terms as mayor (1978–1990). The 
city outlawed discrimination against gay and lesbian people in such matters 
as employment and housing in 1986.[9] In 1989, Koch was defeated by David 
Dinkins in the Democratic Party primary in his bid for a fourth term, and 
then Dinkins narrowly defeated Republican Rudolph Giuliani in the general 
election to become the city's first-ever black mayor.[10] Crime began a 
15-year decline in 1990 during Dinkins's administration, but a combination 
of continued racial strife (such as that in the Crown Heights Riot in 1991),[11][12] 
and an extremely weak economy (in January 1993 the city's unemployment 
rate reached 13.4 percent, the highest level of joblessness seen there 
since the Great Depression).[13] This caused Dinkins' popularity to seriously 
decline (including a threat by residents of Staten Island to secede from 
the city, where in a 1993 referendum, 65% voted to secede, but implementation 
was blocked in the State Assembly).[14] On February 26, 1993, a truck bomb 
detonated in a basement garage of World Trade Center Tower One. The 1,336 
pounds (606 kg) urea nitrate–hydrogen gas enhanced device[15] was intended 
to knock the North Tower (Tower One) into the South Tower (Tower Two), 
bringing both towers down and killing tens of thousands of people.[16][17] 
It failed to do so, but did kill six people and injured more than a thousand.[18] 
In late 1993, David Dinkins was defeated by Rudolph Giuliani in his bid 
for reelection.[19] The city rebounded in the mid- and late 1990s due to 
the steady expansion of the national economy and the Wall Street stock 
market boom[20] that took place concomitantly, as well as the precipitous 
drop in crime, although stubbornly high unemployment remained a local problem. 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, is credited by many 
for revitalizing Times Square[21][22] and making the city more "liveable" 
by cracking down on crime.[23] Changes in the worldwide economy during 
this time proved to be especially favorable to New York because of its 
highly developed transportation and communications infrastructure, as well 
as its massive population base. Over the course of the decade, the city's 
image transformed from being one of a bygone, decaying metropolis to one 
of the world's preeminent "global cities."[24] As for sports, 1994 saw 
a great chapter in the city's sports history, with the New York Rangers 
finally winning their first Stanley Cup since 1940[25][26] and the New 
York Knicks making it to the NBA Finals, where they lost in seven games 
to the Houston Rockets, at the same time.[27][28][29] The Knicks made it 
to the NBA Finals again in 1999, where they lost in five games to the San 
Antonio Spurs.[30] The New York Yankees began a dynasty led by manager 
(and New Yorker) Joe Torre winning the World Series in 1996,[31][32][33] 
1998,[34] 1999,[35] and 2000.[36] On September 11, 2001, hijackers linked 
to the jihadist organization Al-Qaeda piloted two airliners into each of 
the World Trade Center towers. The airplanes, designated for transcontinental 
flights and therefore fully loaded with jet fuel, crashed into the towers 
in the early morning hours of September 11. The crashes ripped gaping holes 
into the towers, and ignited fires that caused the towers to collapse. 
Together with a simultaneous attack on the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, 
and a failed plane hijacking that resulted in a plane crash in Shanksville, 
Pennsylvania, 2,977 victims died in the attacks;[37] the 9/11 attacks led 
to a temporary exodus of business from Lower Manhattan to places such as 
Midtown Manhattan, Jersey City, and Brooklyn, as well as elsewhere, along 
with the need to reposition the broadcasting antennas of several television 
channels.[38] About 430,000 job-months and $2.8 billion in wages were lost 
in the three months after the attacks. The economic effects were mainly 
on the economy's export sectors.[39] The city's GDP was estimated to have 
declined by $27.3 billion for the last three months of 2001 and all of 
2002. The U.S. government provided $11.2 billion in immediate assistance 
to the Government of New York City in September 2001, and $10.5 billion 
in early 2002 for economic development and infrastructure needs.[40] Hundreds 
of thousands of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants, 
including known carcinogens, were spread across Lower Manhattan due to 
the collapse of the Twin Towers.[41][42] Exposure to the toxins in the 
debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses 
among people who were at ground zero.[43][44] The Bush administration ordered 
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements 
regarding air quality in the aftermath of the attacks, citing national 
security, but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to 
pre-September 11 levels until June 2002.[45] Many other closings, evacuations, 
and cancellations followed the attack, either out of fear of further attacks 
or respect for the tragedy. Cleanup of the World Trade Center site was 
completed by the end of May 2002.[46] On November 12, 2001, American Airlines 
Flight 587 crashed into the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens, killing 
all 260 people on board and five others on the ground. It was the second-deadliest 
aviation incident involving an Airbus A300, after Iran Air Flight 655 and 
the second-deadliest aviation incident to occur on U.S. soil, after American 
Airlines Flight 191. In terms of single-airplane crash incidents that were 
ruled accidental and not criminal, as of March 2014, no incident since 
then has surpassed that death toll, though before 2001 there had been deadlier 
incidents of this type. Although initially feared to be another act of 
terrorism,[47][48][49][50][51] the crash was eventually found to have been 
caused by pilot error.[52] New York City was affected by the 2003 North 
America blackout on August 14, 2003, at 4:11 PM, leaving the city without 
electricity for over a day. Unlike in the New York City blackout of 1977, 
there was no major looting. However, during the blackout, Verizon's emergency 
generators failed several times, leaving the emergency services number 
9-1-1 out of service for several periods of about a quarter-hour each. 
New York City's 311 information hotline received over 175,000 calls from 
concerned residents during the weekend. Amateur radio operators attached 
to New York City ARES provided a backup communications link to emergency 
shelters and hospitals. Amateur radio repeaters were supplied with emergency 
power and remained functional. Many major U.S. networks (CBS, NBC, ABC, 
and FOX) and some cable TV networks (such as HBO, MTV, and Nickelodeon) 
were unable to broadcast because of the lack of electricity in the New 
York City area, but back-up stations in Dallas and flagship transmitters 
there made it possible for prime-time television to be broadcast. (ABC 
chose instead to cover the news from Washington, D.C. during the blackout).[53] 
Hurricane Irene brought a destructive storm surge to New York City on the 
evening of August 24–25, 2011. In Manhattan, the Hudson River flooded in 
the Meatpacking District.[54] Long Beach and Freeport, both of which experienced 
serious flooding, were among the worst-hit towns on Long Island,[55] and 
many roads were left impassable. The workers at Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan 
worked to make the World Trade Center site hurricane-proof, and escaped 
major damage, just missing the tenth anniversary of 9/11.[55] The winds 
knocked down many trees and power lines, leaving almost 350,000 homes and 
businesses without power in Nassau and Suffolk counties.[56] Hurricane 
Sandy brought another destructive storm surge to New York City on the evening 
of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels and subway lines 
in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity 
in many parts of the city and its suburbs.[57] City public schools closed 
for four days.[58] CUNY and NYU canceled all classes and campus activities 
for October 30.[59] The New York Stock Exchange was closed for trading 
for two days, the first weather closure of the exchange since 1985.[60] 
It was also the first two-day weather closure since the Great Blizzard 
of 1888.[61] The East River overflowed its banks, flooding large sections 
of Lower Manhattan. Battery Park had a water surge of 13.88 ft.[62] Seven 
subway tunnels under the East River were flooded.[63] The Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority said that the destruction caused by the storm 
was the worst disaster in the 108-year history of the New York City subway 
system.[64] Sea water flooded the Ground Zero construction site.[65] Over 
10 billion gallons of raw and partially treated sewage were released by 
the storm, 94% of which went into waters in and around New York and New 
Jersey.[66] In addition, a four-story Chelsea building's facade crumbled 
and collapsed, leaving the interior on full display; however, no one was 
hurt by the falling masonry.[67] Billionaire media baron Michael Bloomberg, 
a Republican, was elected mayor in 2001, and reelected in 2005 and 2009. 
He used a statistical, results-based approach to city management, appointing 
city commissioners based on their expertise and granting them wide autonomy 
in their decision-making. Breaking with 190 years of tradition, he implemented 
what New York Times political reporter Adam Nagourney called a "bullpen" 
open office plan, similar to a Wall Street trading floor, in which dozens 
of aides and managerial staff are seated together in a large chamber. The 
design is intended to promote accountability and accessibility.[68] Over 
the next ten years, a wave of public- and private-sector building projects 
reshaped large sections of the city, and a residential construction boom 
has resulted in permits being issued for over 25,000 new residential units 
every year. While the 2012 Summer Olympics ultimately went to London, New 
York was among the finalists and the campaign resulted in a plan to replace 
Shea Stadium with a new stadium, as well as an extension of the 7 subway
