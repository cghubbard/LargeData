Australia has sent athletes to almost all editions of the modern Olympic 
Games. Australia has competed in every Summer Olympic Games, as well as 
every Winter Olympics except 1924-32 and 1948. In 1908 and 1912 Australia 
competed with New Zealand under the name Australasia. The Australian Olympic 
Committee was founded and recognised in 1895. Edwin Flack was the first 
athlete to represent Australia at the Olympics. He won gold in both the 
800 metres and the 1500 metres, competed in the marathon and won a bronze 
medal in tennis doubles at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. 
Australia's kit is green and gold.[2][3][4] Australia has hosted the Summer 
Olympic games twice: in 1956 in Melbourne and in 2000 in Sydney. Australia 
finished 3rd and 4th in the respective medal counts. In the Summer Olympics 
since 2000, Australia has placed 4th, 4th, 6th and 10th* respectively. 
(* Australia finished in 8th position in 2012 if the redistributed gold 
medal to Jared Tallent is considered). Given Australia has a population 
of only around 23 million people (ranked 53rd in the world[5]), this fact 
is frequently cited as noteworthy by the mainstream Australian media due 
to a strong sporting culture.[6] Other observers have suggested this may 
also be a result of the generous funding the Australian Government has 
invested into elite sports development with the specific intention of improving 
performance at the Olympic games.[7][8] Prior to Montreal, there was no 
government funding, however. Many of Australia's gold medals have come 
in swimming, a sport which is popular in Australia, with swimmers from 
Dawn Fraser to Ian Thorpe ranking among the sport's all-time greats. Other 
sports where Australia has historically been strong include: Australia 
takes international sporting competition, particularly the Olympics, very 
seriously, and provides much government funding and coaching support to 
elite athletes, partly through the Australian Institute of Sport. Australia 
has been more modestly successful in the track events at the games, particularly 
in modern times. Historically, Betty Cuthbert is Australia's most successful 
track athlete with four gold medals (three in 1956 and one in 1964). Australia 
did not win a medal at the Winter Olympics until 1994, but has moved higher 
on the medal tallies since then (ranking 13th at Vancouver 2010). This 
is a reflection on increased funding of Australia's Olympic Winter Games 
team. Australia have hosted the Games on two occasions: These totals do 
not include ten medals won by Australians competing for the combined Australasia 
team in 1908 and 1912: eight by individuals, one by an exclusively Australian
