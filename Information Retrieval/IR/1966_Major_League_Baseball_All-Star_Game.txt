The 1966 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 37th midseason exhibition 
between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and the National League 
(NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was played 
on July 12, 1966 at the new Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri. 
The game resulted in a 2–1 victory, in 10 innings, for the NL played in 
the memorable humid, and hot 105 °F (41 °C) day. The teams managed just 
six hits apiece in a 10-inning game. A triple by Brooks Robinson in the 
second inning off Sandy Koufax was followed by a wild pitch, giving the 
American Leaguers a 1–0 lead. It turned out to be their only run. The NL 
tied the score in the fourth against Jim Kaat on singles by Willie Mays, 
Roberto Clemente and Ron Santo. There would be no more runs until the 10th. 
Winning pitcher Gaylord Perry got out of a two-on, one-out jam by retiring 
Bobby Richardson on a pop foul and Bill Freehan with a strikeout. Pete 
Richert, pitching the bottom of the 10th, surrendered a base hit to Tim
