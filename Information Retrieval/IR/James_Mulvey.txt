James A. Mulvey was the co-owner of the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers 
of the National League from 1938 through 1973 with his wife, Dearie Mulvey. 
In 1938, he inherited his share of the club from his father-in-law Stephen 
McKeever's estate. In 1950, Walter O'Malley assumed majority control of 
the Dodgers. The Mulvey's minority share was purchased by O'Malley in 1975, 
17 years after the team moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. Mulvey was 
also at one point president of Samuel Goldwyn Productions, for which he 
worked for from 1923, retiring in 1960.[1] Mulvey died at Vero Beach, Florida 
in 1973 after recent years of declining health, where he had a winter home. 
He was buried in Brooklyn after a funeral was held in White Plains.[2]
