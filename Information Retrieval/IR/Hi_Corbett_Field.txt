Hi Corbett Field is a baseball stadium located in Tucson, Arizona. The 
stadium holds approximately 9,500 people. It was the spring training home 
of the Colorado Rockies, and is currently home to the Arizona Wildcats 
baseball team. First teams played at the field in 1937. Hi Corbett Field 
was originally called Randolph Municipal Baseball Park.[1] In 1951, it 
was renamed in honor of Hiram Stevens Corbett (1886–1967),[1] a former 
Arizona state senator who was instrumental in bringing spring training 
to Tucson, specifically by convincing Bill Veeck to bring the Cleveland 
Indians to Tucson in 1947. Veeck owned a ranch in Tucson at the time, and 
he and players sometimes rode Veeck's horses after the games.[2] Veeck 
claimed that he moved the team's training camp from Florida to Arizona 
in order to avoid Florida's Jim Crow laws.[3] Hi Corbett was remodeled 
in 1972 and renovated in 1992, 1997, 1999, and 2012. It is part of a larger 
city park complex, Gene C. Reid Park (which also includes the Reid Park 
Zoo) and Randolph Park, located between Broadway Boulevard and 22nd Street 
in midtown Tucson. The main playing field's dimensions are as follows: 
349 feet in Right Field, 366 feet in Left Field, and 410 feet at its deepest 
in Center Field.[4] The ballpark currently has a capacity of 9,500, including 
598 box seats, 8,350 reserved seats, and 562 bleacher seats. There are 
also two ancillary fields for use in spring training, but these make no 
provision for spectators. For many years, Emil Bossard, groundskeeper for 
the Cleveland Indians, was in charge of Hi Corbett Field, during Spring 
Training. In 1959, he was considered the top groundskeeper in Major League 
Baseball and was inducted into the Major League Baseball Groundskeeper 
Hall of Fame in 2012. According to historian David Leighton, of the Arizona 
Daily Star newspaper, Emil Bossard Field and the street Bossard Place both 
located at Reid Park, are named in his honor.[5] Hi Corbett served as the 
spring training home of the Cleveland Indians from 1945 through 1992. Cleveland 
announced in 1990 that they would depart Tucson and the city tried to attract 
the Baltimore Orioles to move to Arizona.[6] Parts of the 1989 movie Major 
League were filmed at Hi Corbett Field. This production used members of 
the University of Arizona baseball team as extras. From 1993 to 2010, Hi 
Corbett was the pre-season home of the expansion Colorado Rockies, who 
moved into Hi Corbett with their inaugural spring training. Hi Corbett 
is also closely associated with minor league baseball. Aside from the Lizards, 
the Tucson Cowboys (Class C; Arizona–Texas League) played at Hi Corbett 
intermittently from the late 1930s until 1958. The original Tucson Toros 
(Class AAA; Pacific Coast League) played there from their inception in 
1969 until 1997 (see below for new Toros team). The largest Tucson Toros 
crowd at Hi Corbett was 12,863 on May 17, 1981 against Salt Lake City. 
In 1997, the Toros essentially exchanged ownership and franchises with 
the nearby Phoenix Firebirds, so that the ex-Toros played in Scottsdale 
Stadium as the Firebirds, and the ex-Firebirds played at Hi Corbett as 
the Toros. In 1998 the Phoenix team relocated to Fresno, California and 
was renamed the Fresno Grizzlies,[7] and the Tucson Toros became the Tucson 
Sidewinders, and played in the new Tucson Electric Park,[8] which was renamed 
in January 2011 to Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium.[9] The Arizona Fall 
League, a short season league for major league prospects, fielded a team 
at Hi Corbett in 1993 and 1994, known as the Tucson Javelinas. The team 
relocated to Peoria, Arizona in 1995 (becoming the Peoria Javelinas) to 
limit travel distances to the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area. USA Baseball 
was headquartered at Hi Corbett from 1997 to 2003. From 2004 to 2007 Hi 
Corbett was home to the Arizona Heat women's professional softball team. 
In addition to the large number of visiting teams that have appeared there 
as part of regular league play, Hi Corbett has hosted exhibition games 
featuring the Colorado Silver Bullets, Houston Astros and University of 
Arizona, among others. Baseball Hall of Fame members who played at Hi Corbett 
include Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Ted Williams and many others.[2] On 
May 21, 2009, the Tucson Toros returned to Hi Corbett Field after an 11-year 
absence, playing as an Independent Professional Baseball League team of 
the Golden Baseball League. Hi Corbett Field was the home stadium of the 
Toros until they were evicted by the city of Tucson in 2011 before they 
could join the North American League. In 2012, the ballpark became the 
new home of the University of Arizona Wildcats baseball team. Through the 
first three-game series of the season against North Dakota State, the attendance 
at the stadium was a total of 8,870, which was nearly ¼ of the total home 
attendance for the Wildcats' previous season at Sancet Stadium. The park 
hosted both an NCAA Regional and Super Regional, as Arizona won both to 
advance to the 2012 College World Series.[10] The relocation of the Wildcat 
baseball program to Hi Corbett has been noted as a major factor in the 
team's successful 2012 season, and their fourth national championship.[11] 
In 2007, the Rockies asked for a package of improvements to Hi Corbett 
potentially totaling $10–20 million under the threat of a possible move 
to Goodyear, Arizona. In response, Pima County chartered a regional sports 
and tourism authority, funded by tourism and other taxes.[12] [13] Such 
authority was approved both by the Arizona Legislature and voters of the 
county. The departure of the Chicago White Sox from Kino Veterans Memorial 
Stadium, has forced team management to expedite plans for a future move, 
as the Rockies have stated that they need two other teams in order for 
Tucson to be a viable spring training town for them. The Rockies decided 
to move to the new Salt River Fields at Talking Stick in 2011 on tribal 
land owned by the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community near Scottsdale. 
The Arizona Diamondbacks share that facility. In an effort to have its 
baseball program compete in the best possible facilities, in August 2011, 
the University of Arizona signed an agreement with the city of Tucson for 
Arizona baseball to play its home games at Hi Corbett for the 2012 season, 
and will play there for at least the next five years. The UA has made several 
upgrades to the facility, where the Wildcats previously played selected 
games in the 1960s and '70s. Hi Corbett is located about three miles southeast 
of the UA campus.[14] In 2013, the Wildcats ranked 21st among Division 
I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 2,733 per home game.[15] University
