Harry Loran "Nemo" Leibold (February 17, 1892 – February 4, 1977) was an 
outfielder in Major League Baseball from 1913 to 1925. He played for the 
Cleveland Naps, Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, and Washington Senators. 
He stood at 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m) and was nicknamed for the comic strip character 
Little Nemo.[1] Leibold began his professional career in 1911 with the 
minor league Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. In 1913, he 
was traded to the Cleveland Naps, and he immediately broke into the starting

Chicago, Leibold was a member of two American League championship teams.

of 1917 and 1919. After the 1920 season, he was traded to the Boston Red 
Sox with Shano Collins for Harry Hooper, then played for the Red Sox and 
Washington Senators for 2.5 seasons each. Leibold was sent down to the 
minor leagues in 1926. He was a player-manager for the Columbus Red Birds 
from 1928 to 1932, then managed various other teams until 1948.[2] In one
