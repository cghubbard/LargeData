Liberty Media Corporation (commonly referred to as Liberty Media or just 
Liberty) is an American mass media company controlled by Chairman John 
C. Malone, who owns a majority of the voting shares. Liberty Media began 
in 1991 as a spin-off of TCI, an American cable-television group. Peter 
Barton, hired by TCI's Malone, served as president until retiring in April 
1997 to start an investment firm and spend time with his family.[3] The 
company took over TCI assets considered to have little value, but Barton 
completed "a deal every ten days for six years" and made the company a 
big success. Liberty was merged back into TCI in the mid-1990s.[4] On March 
13, 1998, Liberty Media Group and TCI Group announced the merger of Encore 
and STARZ! into a single company – Encore Media Group, owned by Liberty. 
Encore was taking advantage of the growth of digital cable, while TCI, 
which had previously owned twenty percent of Encore, was more interested 
in traditional cable.[5] After U.S. Department of Justice approval that 
required TCI to sell its 23.5% interest in Sprint Corporation PSC,[6] TCI 
merged with AT&T on March 9, 1999[7] for approximately $48 billion. Liberty 
Media merged with TCI Ventures Group LLC (TCIVA), TCI's telephone and Internet 
businesses, and the resulting company became part of AT&T, giving Liberty 
Media $5.5 billion for use to repurchase stock or buy other companies. 
AT&T bought the other TCI businesses – @Home Corp., National Digital Television 
Center and Western Tele-Communications Inc. – for $2.5 billion in cash. 
TCI chairman Malone, who became head of the new company, said buyers would 
not want all of TCI, but they would be interested in Liberty Media.[8] 
Malone wanted to start a finance unit similar to GE Capital, which could 
start new cable or Internet services. TCI had already planned digital cable 
set-top boxes.[9] On September 28, 1998, Liberty Media announced the formation 
of Liberty Interactive, a company which would take advantage of new technologies 
such as set-top boxes to develop interactive programming. The company would 
own 86% of TCI Music Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: TUNE/TUNEP). As of January 1, 
1999, E! Entertainment President and Chief Executive Officer Lee Masters 
would become the new company's CEO, and Bruce Ravenel would be Chief Technology 
Officer.[10] On September 10, 1999, Liberty Media Group renamed TCI Music 
to Liberty Digital Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: LDIG), with the new company trading 
on NASDAQ's National Market tier, after Liberty Media traded most of its 
Internet content, interactive television assets, and rights to provide 
AT&T's cable systems with interactive services, plus cash and notes valued 
at $150 million, for TCI Music stock.[11] Masters, who became Liberty Digital's 
CEO, told The Wall Street Journal that the new company had a value of $1 
billion, $650 million of that from the interactive unit of Liberty Media, 
which had also used the name Liberty Digital.[12] Liberty Digital lost 
$244 million with revenue of $66 million in 1999, thanks to investments 
in struggling Internet businesses homegrocer.com, drugstore.com, TiVo and 
iVillage. The company bought half of the Game Show Network because of its 
interactive features.[13] On December 17, 1999, TCI Satellite Entertainment 
Inc. (TSAT), based in Englewood, Colorado, announced that Liberty Media 
was trading its interest in Sprint PCS for $300 million in TCI Satellite 
preferred stock. A new company, 90% owned by Liberty Media and 10% owned 
by TCI Satellite, would combine the satellite-related businesses and take 
advantage of the growing area of Internet content. Liberty Media president 
and CEO Robert R. Bennett said the deal would benefit stockholders of both 
companies.[14] Another new company was Liberty Livewire, formed from Todd-AO 
and two other companies by Liberty Media, which provided audio and video 
post-production services. David Beddow of TCI became CEO.[15] Liberty Media's 
Discovery Channel and QVC continued to do well, but the company's newer 
projects had problems, and the company's stock price dropped by half. Malone 
no longer had the "Malone halo" he once did. If AT&T agreed to spin off 
Liberty Media, new deals such as a possible News Corp. purchase of DirecTV 
would be easier because AT&T would no longer require federal approval to 
complete such deals.[16] Liberty Media was spun off from AT&T on August 
10, 2001.[17] This was one of three possible actions to ensure federal 
approval of AT&T's $54 billion acquisition of MediaOne Group – the others 
were selling its 25.5% share of Time Warner Entertainment and dropping 
11.8 million cable customers.[18] Also in 2001, Liberty Media acquired 
the remainder of Liberty Digital and Liberty Satellite & Technology (formerly 
TCI Satellite). Both companies were independent spinoffs of TCI, though 
Liberty already owned 90% of both companies after the exchange for Sprint 
PCS stock. Being independent increased their asset values, but the stock 
prices of both dropped, negating any benefits.[19][20] Liberty Media subsequently 
spent $5 billion on nine German regional cable networks. Apart from television 
distribution it holds major interests in other groups. For example, it 
was the largest shareholder in News Corporation (though the founding Murdoch 
family owns more voting shares), and had a 4% stake in Time Warner. In 
June 2005, Liberty Media International combined with UnitedGlobalCom, creating 
Liberty Global. In May 2006, Time Warner acquired Liberty Media's 50% stake 
in Court TV for $735 million.[21] On May 16, 2006, IDT sold its IDT Entertainment 
division to Liberty Media "for all of Liberty Media's interests in IDT, 
$186 million in cash and the assumption of existing indebtedness". IDT 
Entertainment's assets and Starz Entertainment Group's line of premium 
television channels will combine to produce content for all distribution 
platforms.[22] Liberty negotiated an asset swap with News Corp. and Time 
Warner that would give it control of DirecTV and the Atlanta Braves baseball 
team.[23] On February 12, 2007, the deal was completed with Time Warner 
wherein Liberty would receive the Atlanta Braves, a group of craft magazines 
and $1 billion in cash in exchange for 60 million shares of Time Warner 
stock (valued at $1.27 billion as of market close on February 12, 2007).[24] 
The deal was approved by Major League Baseball and then completed on May 
16, 2007.[25] On February 20, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission 
approved the exchange of 16.3% of News Corp. for 38.4% of DirecTV, an $11 
billion deal that also gave Liberty sports networks in Denver, Pittsburgh 
and Seattle plus $550 million in cash.[26] In April 2007, Liberty completed 
a purchase of Green Bay, Wisconsin, television station WFRV-TV, and satellite 
station WJMN-TV in Escanaba, Michigan, which serves the Marquette, Michigan, 
market. The deal was part of a swap of 7.59 million shares of common stock 
in CBS, the stations' owner, that was held by Liberty Media; in exchange 
for the stock, CBS gave liberty the stations and $170 million in cash.[27] 
Liberty announced plans in April 2011 to sell WFRV and WJMN to Nexstar 
Broadcasting Group for $20 million.[28] On February 17, 2009, Liberty announced 
that it would invest up to $530 million into the struggling Sirius XM Radio 
Inc., in a structured deal that would help the satellite radio provider 
avoid filing bankruptcy protection by meeting its obligations. The deal 
also provided for two board seats for Liberty Media, and provided cash 
for operations and development, with a maturity date of December 2012 for 
the loan.[29] On March 6, the two companies approved the second part of 
the deal, with Sirius XM getting $250 million immediately and Liberty receiving 
12.5 million shares of preferred stock convertible into a 40% ownership 
of Sirius XM common stock.[30] On the Fortune 500 list 2011, Liberty Media 
was ranked 224, moving up from 2010 when they were ranked 227.[31] In May 
2011, Liberty announced it was in talks to buy the Barnes & Noble bookstore 
chain for $1.02 billion.[32] It eventually bought a 16% stake in the form 
of preferred stock in Barnes & Noble for $204 million.[33] On August 8, 
2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin off Starz into a separate 
publicly traded company.[34] The spin-off of Starz Inc. was completed on 
January 15, 2013.[35] The company agreed in March 2013 to pay $2.62 billion 
for 27.3% of Charter Communications from Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital 
Management and Crestview Partners with the provision that Liberty would 
not increase its stake past 35% until after January 2016 but no more than 
39.99%.[36] By May 1, Liberty completed the transaction and placed four 
directors on Charter's board.[37] In late 2016, Liberty Media agreed to 
buy the Formula One Group for US$4.4 billion (£3.3 billion).[38] On September 
3, 2008, Liberty Media decided to initiate the process of spinning off 
Liberty Entertainment to Liberty Media shareholders, leaving Malone with 
a majority ownership of the new company.[41] On May 4, 2009, The DirecTV 
Group Inc. said it would become a part of Liberty's entertainment unit, 
part of which would then be spun off as a separate company called DirecTV. 
The new company would also acquire Liberty's one hundred percent interests 
in the three FSN networks and its 50% interest in GSN. The rest of the 
unit would be traded as Liberty Starz. Liberty would increase its share 
of DirecTV from 48 to 54%, with Malone and his family owning 24%.[citation 
needed] On May 4, 2009, Liberty announced that it would split off Liberty 
Entertainment, Inc., a subsidiary of Liberty owning the three Fox Sports 
Net (FSN) channels (now Root Sports) acquired under the swap with News 
Corp. and Liberty's 65% interest in GSN, into a separate company that would 
merge with The DirecTV Group, reducing Liberty owner John Malone's stake 
in DirecTV to 24%.[42] The merger was completed on November 19, 2009, with 
The DirecTV Group and Liberty Entertainment becoming subsidiaries of a 
new company named DirecTV.[43] On June 16, 2010, Malone exchanged his preferred 
stock in DirecTV with equivalent amounts of common stock, reducing his 
voting interest in the company from 24% to 3%, with Malone resigning as 
chairman and ending his managerial role at DirecTV.[44] [45] and Liberty's 
interests in: Liberty Media is a prominent investor. In addition to its 
own offerings, the company also owns the stock of several major media and 
telecommunication companies. As of December 22, 2013,[46] Liberty has a
