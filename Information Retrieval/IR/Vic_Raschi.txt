Victor John Angelo "Vic" Raschi (March 28, 1919 – October 14, 1988) was 
a Major League Baseball pitcher. He was one of the top pitchers for the 
New York Yankees in the late 1940s and early 1950s, forming (with Allie 
Reynolds and Eddie Lopat) the "Big Three" of the Yankees' pitching staff. 
Later in his career, as a pitcher with the St. Louis Cardinals, he was 
responsible for allowing Hank Aaron's first career home run.[1] Raschi 
was born in West Springfield, Massachusetts and went on to graduate from 
the College of William and Mary. Raschi's debut on the New York Yankees 
was on September 23, 1946, wearing uniform number 12. The next year he 
wore three different numbers (17, 19, and 43) but number 17 became his 
from then on during his Yankee career. From 1946 to 1953, Raschi won 120 
games while losing 50. He led the American League in won/lost percentage 
with a .724 record in 1950, and in strikeouts with 164 in 1951. Raschi 
had a .184 career batting average, with seven runs batted in (RBI) in one 
game, an American League record for pitchers, on August 3, 1953. While 
playing with the Yankees, he and his wife Sally lived in a home in Hillsdale, 
New Jersey.[2] On February 24, 1954, Yankee fans were surprised to see 
Raschi traded to the St. Louis Cardinals. In the remaining two years of 
his career, with the Cardinals and Kansas City Athletics (who signed him 
as a free agent on April 28, 1955 when the Cardinals released him), Raschi 
won only 12 games while losing 16. On April 23, 1954, while with the Cardinals, 
Raschi gave up the first of Hank Aaron's 755 career home runs. Aaron, Major 
League Baseball′s future home run king, had also notched his first career 
hit off Raschi eight days earlier. He kept his uniform number 17 on the 
Cardinals, but on the A's took number 16. Raschi retired to Geneseo, New 
York, where he ran a liquor store and served as a baseball coach at Geneseo 
State College (now the State University of New York at Geneseo). In 1975, 
the college dedicated the Victor J. Raschi Baseball Field, which is now
