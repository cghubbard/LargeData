The 1941 Philadelphia Phillies season was a season in Major League Baseball. 
The Phillies finished eighth in the National League with a record of 43 
wins and 111 losses. On July 1, the Phillies played the Dodgers in Brooklyn; 
the game was televised by WNBT in New York (now WNBC), making the ballgame 
the first program aired by a commercial TV station in the United States. 
Although the Phillies were terrible and the Dodgers would go on to win 
the pennant, the Phils surprised Brooklyn, scoring two runs in the tenth 
inning to win the game, 6-4. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders
