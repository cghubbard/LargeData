Cienfuegos (American Spanish: [sjeɱˈfweɣos]), capital of Cienfuegos Province, 
is a city on the southern coast of Cuba.[4] It is located about 250 km 
(160 mi) from Havana and has a population of 150,000. The city is dubbed 
La Perla del Sur (Pearl of the South). Cienfuegos literally translates 
to "one hundred fires"—cien meaning "one hundred", fuegos meaning "fires". 
The area where the city lies was identified as Cacicazgo de Jagua by early 
Spanish conquistadors. It was originally settled by Taino indigenous people. 
Cacicazgo translates from the Taino language as "chiefdom". Cacicazgo de 
Jagua was therefore the chiefdom of Chief Jagua. The city was later settled 
by French immigrants from Bordeaux and Louisiana led by Don Louis de Clouet 
on April 22, 1819.[1] The settlers named the city Fernandina de Jagua in 
honor of King Ferdinand VII of Spain and Chief Jagua.[5] The settlement 
successively became a town (villa) in 1829, renamed for José Cienfuegos, 
Captain General of Cuba (1816–19), and a city in 1880. Many of the streets 
in old town reflect French origins in their names: Bouyón, D'Clouet, Hourruitiner, 
Gacel, and Griffo, for instance. Cienfuegos port, despite being one of 
the latest settlements established during the colonial era, soon grew to 
be a powerful town due to the fertile fields surrounding it and its position 
on the trade route between Jamaica and South American cities to the southeast 
and the hinterland provincial capital of Santa Clara to the northeast. 
Its advantageous trading location on the historically eponymous Bay of 
Jagua was used by the Cuban sugar oligarchy when a railroad was built between 
both cities between 1853 and 1860.[6][7] Near Cienfuegos was the scene 
of a battle during the Spanish–American War on May 11, 1898, between American 
Marines attempting to sever underwater Spanish communication lines and 
the Spanish defenders. During the Cuban Revolution, the city saw an uprising 
against Fulgencio Batista and was bombed in retaliation on September 5, 
1957.[8] In 1969 and 1970, Soviet naval vessels visited the city. This 
appeared to be in violation of the Kennedy-Khrushchev agreements of 1962. 
However, there was no notice given by the United States and no confrontation 
ensued.[9] In 2005, Hurricane Dennis made its second landfall near Cienfuegos 
at about 1:00PM AST (17:00 UTC) with winds of 232 km/h (144 mph) and gusts 
reaching 285 km/h (177 mph). Near the entrance to Cienfuegos Bay is Castillo 
de Jagua (full name: Castillo de Nuestra Señora de los Angeles de Jagua), 
a fortress erected in 1745 for protection against Caribbean pirates. Cienfuegos, 
one of the chief seaports of Cuba, is a center of the sugar trade as well 
as coffee and tobacco. While sugarcane is the chief crop, local farmers 
also grow coffee. In 2004, the municipality of Cienfuegos had a population 
of 163,824.[3] With a total area of 333 km2 (129 sq mi),[2] it has a population 
density of 492.0/km2 (1,274/sq mi). According to the Köppen Climate Classification 
system, Cienfuegos has a tropical savanna climate, abbreviated "Aw" on 
climate maps. In 2005, UNESCO inscribed the Urban Historic Centre of Cienfuegos 
on the World Heritage List, citing Cienfuegos as the best extant example 
of early 19th century Spanish Enlightenment implementation in urban planning.[11] 
The downtown area contains 6 buildings from 1819–50, 327 buildings from 
1851–1900, and 1188 buildings from the 20th century. There is no other 
place in the Caribbean which contains such a remarkable cluster of Neoclassical 
structures. Cienfuegos fields a team in the Cuban National Series, the 
Cienfuegos Elefantes. Since joining the league in 1977–78, the best finish 
the Camaroneros have achieved is a 3rd place showing in the 2010–11 Cuban 
National Series. Despite finishing with the best record at 59–31, the Elefantes 
lost the semifinals in six games to the eventual champions, the Pinar del 
Río Vegueros. Cienfuegos has the following sister cities: Statue of José 
Martí Cathedral of Cienfuegos and Medici Lions Statue of Benny More Fortress
