Coordinates: 23°N 102°W﻿ / ﻿23°N 102°W﻿ / 23; -102 Mexico (Spanish: México, 
pronounced: [ˈme.xi.ko] ( listen)), officially the United Mexican States 
(Spanish: Estados Unidos Mexicanos,  listen (help·info)),[9][10][11][12] 
is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered 
to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific 
Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and 
to the east by the Gulf of Mexico.[13] Covering almost two million square 
kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi),[12] Mexico is the sixth largest country 
in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in 
the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million,[14] it is 
the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking 
country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin 
America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district 
that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include 
Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. Pre-Columbian 
Mexico was home to many advanced Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the 
Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Maya and Aztec before first contact 
with Europeans. In 1521, the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the 
territory from its base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan, which was administered 
as the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Three centuries later, this territory 
became Mexico following recognition in 1821 after the colony's Mexican 
War of Independence. The tumultuous post-independence period was characterized 
by economic instability and many political changes. The Mexican–American 
War (1846–48) led to the territorial cession of the extensive northern 
borderlands, one-third of its territory, to the United States. The Pastry 
War, the Franco-Mexican War, a civil war, two empires and a domestic dictatorship 
occurred through the 19th century. The dictatorship was overthrown in the 
Mexican Revolution of 1910, which culminated with the promulgation of the 
1917 Constitution and the emergence of the country's current political 
system. Mexico has the fifteenth largest nominal GDP and the eleventh largest 
by purchasing power parity. The Mexican economy is strongly linked to those 
of its North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) partners, especially 
the United States.[15][16] Mexico was the first Latin American member of 
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), joining 
in 1994. It is classified as an upper-middle income country by the World 
Bank[17] and a newly industrialized country by several analysts.[18][19][20][21] 
By 2050, Mexico could become the world's fifth or seventh largest economy.[22][23] 
The country is considered both a regional power and middle power,[24][25][26][27] 
and is often identified as an emerging global power.[28] Due to its rich 
culture and history, Mexico ranks first in the Americas and sixth in the 
world by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[29][30][31] In 2015 it 
was the 9th most visited country in the world, with 32.1 million international 
arrivals.[32][33] Mexico is a member of the United Nations, the World Trade 
Organization, the G8+5, the G20, the Uniting for Consensus and is an observer 
of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie since 2014. Mēxihco 
is the Nahuatl term for the heartland of the Aztec Empire, namely,[34] 
the Valley of Mexico, and its people, the Mexica, and surrounding territories. 
This became the future State of Mexico as a division of New Spain prior 
to independence (compare Latium). It is generally considered to be a toponym 
for the valley which became the primary ethnonym for the Aztec Triple Alliance 
as a result, or vice versa. After New Spain won independence from Spain, 
representatives decided to name the new country after its capital, Mexico 
City. This was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient Mexica capital of 
Mexico-Tenochtitlan. Traditionally, the name Tenochtitlan was thought to 
come from Nahuatl tetl [ˈtetɬ] ("rock") and nōchtli [ˈnoːtʃtɬi] ("prickly 
pear") and is often thought to mean "Among the prickly pears [growing among] 
rocks". However, one attestation in the late 16th-century manuscript known 
as "the Bancroft dialogues" suggests the second vowel was short, so that 
the true etymology remains uncertain.[35] The suffix -co is the Nahuatl 
locative, making the word a place name. Beyond that, the etymology is uncertain. 
It has been suggested that it is derived from Mextli or Mēxihtli, a secret 
name for the god of war and patron of the Mexica, Huitzilopochtli, in which 
case Mēxihco means "Place where Huitzilopochtli lives".[36] Another hypothesis 
suggests that Mēxihco derives from a portmanteau of the Nahuatl words for 
"Moon" (Mētztli) and navel (xīctli).[37] This meaning ("Place at the Center 
of the Moon") might refer to Tenochtitlan's position in the middle of Lake 
Texcoco. The system of interconnected lakes, of which Texcoco formed the 
center, had the form of a rabbit, which the Mesoamericans pareidolically 
associated with the Moon. Still another hypothesis suggests that the word 
is derived from Mēctli, the goddess of maguey.[37] The name of the city-state 
was transliterated to Spanish as México with the phonetic value of the 
letter 'x' in Medieval Spanish, which represented the voiceless postalveolar 
fricative [ʃ]. This sound, as well as the voiced postalveolar fricative 
[ʒ], represented by a 'j', evolved into a voiceless velar fricative [x] 
during the 16th century. This led to the use of the variant Méjico in many 
publications in Spanish, most notably in Spain, whereas in Mexico and most 
other Spanish–speaking countries México was the preferred spelling. In 
recent years the Real Academia Española, which regulates the Spanish language, 
determined that both variants are acceptable in Spanish but that the normative 
recommended spelling is México.[38] The majority of publications in all 
Spanish-speaking countries now adhere to the new norm, even though the 
alternative variant is still occasionally used.[citation needed] In English, 
the 'x' in Mexico represents neither the original nor the current sound, 
but the consonant cluster [ks]. The official name of the country has changed 
as the form of government has changed. On three occasions (1325–1521, 1821–1823, 
and 1863–1867), the country was known as Imperio Mexicano (Mexican Empire). 
All three federal constitutions (1824, 1857 and 1917, the current constitution) 
used the name Estados Unidos Mexicanos[39]—or the variant Estados-Unidos 
Mexicanos,[40] all of which have been translated as "United Mexican States". 
The phrase República Mexicana, "Mexican Republic", was used in the 1836 
Constitutional Laws.[41] On November 22, 2012, president Felipe Calderón 
sent to the Mexican Congress a piece of legislation to change the country's 
name officially to simply Mexico. To be implemented, the bill needed to 
be passed by both houses of Congress, as well as a majority of Mexico's 
31 State legislatures. As this legislation was proposed just a week before 
Calderón turned power over to Enrique Peña Nieto, Calderón's critics saw 
this as a symbolic gesture.[42] The earliest human artifacts in Mexico 
are chips of stone tools found near campfire remains in the Valley of Mexico 
and radiocarbon-dated to circa 10,000 years ago.[43] Mexico is the site 
of the domestication of maize, tomato and beans, which produced an agricultural 
surplus. This enabled the transition from paleo-Indian hunter-gatherers 
to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 5000 BCE.[44] In the 
subsequent formative eras, maize cultivation and cultural traits such as 
a mythological and religious complex, and a vigesimal numeric system, were 
diffused from the Mexican cultures to the rest of the Mesoamerican culture 
area.[45] In this period, villages became more dense in terms of population, 
becoming socially stratified with an artisan class, and developing into 
chiefdoms. The most powerful rulers had religious and political power, 
organizing construction of large ceremonial centers developed.[46] The 
earliest complex civilizations in Mexico was the Olmec culture, which flourished 
on the Gulf Coast from around 1500 BCE. Olmec cultural traits diffused 
through Mexico into other formative-era cultures in Chiapas, Oaxaca and 
the Valley of Mexico. The formative period saw the spread of distinct religious 
and symbolic traditions, as well as artistic and architectural complexes.[47] 
The formative-era of Mesoamerica is considered one of the six independent 
cradles of civilization. In the subsequent pre-classical period, the Maya 
and Zapotec civilizations developed complex centers at Calakmul and Monte 
Albán, respectively. During this period the first true Mesoamerican writing 
systems were developed in the Epi-Olmec and the Zapotec cultures. The Mesoamerican 
writing tradition reached its height in the Classic Maya Hieroglyphic script.[48] 
In Central Mexico, the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy 
of Teotihuacan, which formed a military and commercial empire whose political 
influence stretched south into the Maya area as well as north. Teotihuacan, 
with a population of more than 150,000 people, had some of the largest 
pyramidal structures in the pre-Columbian Americas.[49] After the collapse 
of Teotihuacán around 600 CE, competition ensued between several important 
political centers in central Mexico such as Xochicalco and Cholula. At 
this time, during the Epi-Classic, Nahua peoples began moving south into 
Mesoamerica from the North, and became politically and culturally dominant 
in central Mexico, as they displaced speakers of Oto-Manguean languages. 
During the early post-classic, Central Mexico was dominated by the Toltec 
culture, Oaxaca by the Mixtec, and the lowland Maya area had important 
centers at Chichén Itzá and Mayapán. Toward the end of the post-Classic 
period, the Mexica established dominance.[clarification needed] Alexander 
von Humboldt originated the modern usage of "Aztec" as a collective term 
applied to all the people linked by trade, custom, religion, and language 
to the Mexica state and Ēxcān Tlahtōlōyān, the Triple Alliance. In 1843, 
with the publication of the work of William H. Prescott, it was adopted 
by most of the world, including 19th-century Mexican scholars who considered 
it a way to distinguish present-day Mexicans from pre-conquest Mexicans. 
This usage has been the subject of debate since the late 20th century.[50] 
The Aztec empire was an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not 
exert supreme authority over the conquered lands; it was satisfied with 
the payment of tributes from them. It was a discontinuous empire because 
not all dominated territories were connected; for example, the southern 
peripheral zones of Xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center. 
The hegemonic nature of the Aztec empire was demonstrated by their restoration 
of local rulers to their former position after their city-state was conquered. 
The Aztec did not interfere in local affairs, as long as the tributes were 
paid.[51] The Aztec of Central Mexico built a tributary empire covering 
most of central Mexico.[52] The Aztec were noted for practicing human sacrifice 
on a large scale. Along with this practice, they avoided killing enemies 
on the battlefield. Their warring casualty rate was far lower than that 
of their Spanish counterparts, whose principal objective was immediate 
slaughter during battle.[53] This distinct Mesoamerican cultural tradition 
of human sacrifice ended with the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. 
Over the next centuries Mexican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected 
to Spanish colonial rule.[54] The Spanish first learned of Mexico during 
the Juan de Grijalva expedition of 1518. The natives kept "repeating: Colua, 
Colua, and Mexico, Mexico, but we [explorers] did not know what Colua or 
Mexico meant", until encountering Montezuma's governor at the mouth of 
the Rio de las Banderas.[55]:33–36 The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire 
began in February 1519 when Hernán Cortés arrived at the port in Veracruz 
with ca. 500 conquistadores. After taking control of that city, he moved 
on to the Aztec capital. In his search for gold and other riches, Cortés 
decided to invade and conquer the Aztec empire.[56] When the Spaniards 
arrived, the ruler of the Aztec empire was Moctezuma II, who was later 
killed. His successor and brother Cuitláhuac took control of the Aztec 
empire, but was among the first to fall from the first smallpox epidemic 
in the area a short time later.[57] Unintentionally introduced by Spanish 
conquerors, among whom smallpox was endemic, the infectious disease ravaged 
Mesoamerica in the 1520s. It killed more than 3 million natives as they 
had no immunity.[58] Other sources, however, mentioned that the death toll 
of the Aztecs might have reached 15 million (out of a population of less 
than 30 million) although such a high number conflicts with the 350,000 
Aztecs who ruled an empire of 5 million or 10 million.[59] Severely weakened, 
the Aztec empire was easily defeated by Cortés and his forces on his second 
return with the help of state of Tlaxcala whose population estimate was 
300,000.[60] The native population declined 80–90% by 1600 to 1–2.5 million. 
Any population estimate of pre-Columbian Mexico is bound to be a guess 
but 8–12 million is often suggested for the area encompassed by the modern 
nation. Smallpox was a devastating disease: it generally killed Aztecs 
but not Spaniards, who as Europeans had already been exposed to it in their 
cities for centuries and therefore had developed acquired immunity.[61] 
The deaths caused by smallpox are believed to have triggered a rapid growth 
of Christianity in Mexico and the Americas. At first, the Aztecs believed 
the epidemic was a punishment from an angry god, but they later accepted 
their fate and no longer resisted the Spanish rule.[62] Many of the surviving 
Aztecs believed that smallpox could be credited to the superiority of the 
Christian god, which resulted in their acceptance of Catholicism and yielding 
to the Spanish rule throughout Mexico.[63] The territory became part of 
the Spanish Empire under the name of New Spain. Mexico City was systematically 
rebuilt by Cortés following the Fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521. Much of the 
identity, traditions and architecture of Mexico developed during the 300-year 
colonial period.[64] The capture of Tenochtitlan marked the beginning of 
a 300-year-long colonial period, during which Mexico was known as "New 
Spain". Contrary to a widespread misconception, Spain did not conquer all 
of the Aztec Empire nor the rest of Mesoamerica when Cortes took Tenochtitlan. 
It required another two centuries to complete the conquest: rebellions 
broke out within the old empire and wars continued with other native peoples. 
After the fall of Tenochtitlan, it took the Spaniards decades of sporadic 
warfare to subdue the rest of Mesoamerica. Particularly fierce was the 
Chichimeca War (1576–1606) and the Tepehuán Revolt (1616–1620) in the north. 
The Council of Indies and the mendicant religious, which arrived in Mesoamerica 
as early as 1524, labored to generate capital for the crown of Spain and 
convert the Indian populations to Catholicism. During this period and the 
following Colonial periods, the efforts of the mendicant friars resulted 
in religious syncretism which combined the Pre-Hispanic cultures with Spanish 
socio-religious concepts. The result was mixed culture in multi-ethnic 
State that relied on the "repartimiento" system of peasant "Republics of 
Indians" which performed the work. The pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican system 
was replaced by the encomienda feudal-style system of Spain probably adapted 
to the pre-Hispanic tradition. This in turn was replaced in the 19th century 
by a debt-based inscription of labor. Its burden was a catalyst for political 
revitalization movements and prompted the revolution that ended colonial 
New Spain in 1821. According to West,[who?] "the first gold and silver 
that the Spaniards obtained in Mexico came not from mining but in the form 
of native Indian artifacts looted from palaces, temples, graves and other 
sacred places, where the Aztec and Tarascan nobility had accumulated such 
treasures for generations." Cortes soon claimed the Tamazula area as a 
source of silver. Silver lodes were discovered by the 1530s and mined in 
Zumpango del Rio and an area called the "Provincia de la Plata". The Provincia 
consisted of five major asientos de minas in the areas of Amatepec, Sultepec, 
Taxco, Zacualpan, and Temascaltepec.[65] During this period, Mexico was 
part of the much larger Viceroyalty of New Spain, which included Cuba, 
Puerto Rico, Central America as far south as Costa Rica, Florida, the southwestern 
United States and the Philippines. Spain during the 16th century focused 
its energies on areas with dense populations that had produced Pre-Columbian 
civilizations, since these areas could provide the settlers with a disciplined 
labor force and a population to catechize. Territories populated by nomadic 
peoples were hard to conquer and hold. Europeans were a low percentage 
of the population, from 100,000 in 1600 of 2 million, perhaps only 5% of 
4 million by 1700, though 1.5 million of 8 million population by 1800 due 
to natural increase and immigration from Spain. The 18th century sees a 
great increase in the percentage of mestizos (The Penguin Atlas of World 
Population History, pp. 291–92). The Spanish explored a good part of North 
America, even seeking the fabled "El Dorado." They made no concerted effort 
to settle the northern desert regions in what is now the United States 
until the end of the 16th century (Santa Fe, 1598). Colonial law with Spanish 
roots was introduced and attached to native customs creating a hierarchy 
between local jurisdiction (the Cabildos) and the Crown, whereby upper 
administrative offices were closed to the natives, even those of pure Spanish 
blood. Administration was based on the racial separation of the population 
among "Republics" of Spaniards, Indians and Mestizos, autonomous and directly 
dependent on the king himself. From an economic point of view, New Spain 
was administered principally for the benefit of the Empire and its military 
and defensive efforts. Mexico provided more than half of the Empire's taxes 
and supported the administration of all North and Central America. Competition 
with Spain was discouraged to the extent that activities like cultivation 
of grapes and olives, introduced by Cortez himself, was banned out of fear 
that these crops would compete with Spain's. In order to protect Mexico 
from the attacks of English, French and Dutch pirates and protect the Crown's 
monopoly of revenue only two ports were open to foreign trade—Veracruz 
on the Atlantic and Acapulco on the Pacific. The pirates attacked, plundered 
and ravaged several cities like Campeche (1557), Veracruz (1568) and Alvarado 
(1667). Education was encouraged by the Crown from the very beginning. 
Mexico boasts the first primary school (Texcoco, 1523), first university 
(1551) and the first printing house (1524) in the Americas. Indigenous 
languages were studied mainly by the religious orders during the first 
centuries. They became official languages in the so-called Republic of 
Indians to be outlawed and ignored after independence by the prevailing 
Spanish-speaking creoles. Mexico produced important cultural achievements 
during the colonial period, like the literature of Sor Juana Inés de la 
Cruz and Ruiz de Alarcón, as well as cathedrals, civil monuments, forts 
and colonial cities such as Puebla, Mexico City, Querétaro, Zacatecas and 
others, today part of Unesco's World Heritage. The syncretism between indigenous 
and Spanish cultures in New Spain gave birth to many of today's Mexican 
cultural traits like tequila (first distilled in the 16th century), mariachi 
(18th), jarabe (17th), charros (17th) and Mexican cuisine – a mixture of 
European and indigenous ingredients and techniques. On September 16, 1810, 
a "loyalist revolt" against the ruling Junta was declared by priest Miguel 
Hidalgo y Costilla, in the small town of Dolores, Guanajuato.[66] The first 
insurgent group was formed by Hidalgo, the Spanish viceregal army captain 
Ignacio Allende, the militia captain Juan Aldama and "La Corregidora" Josefa 
Ortiz de Domínguez. Hidalgo and some of his soldiers were captured and 
executed by firing squad in Chihuahua, on July 31, 1811. Following his 
death, the leadership was assumed by priest José María Morelos, who occupied 
key southern cities. In 1813 the Congress of Chilpancingo was convened 
and, on November 6, signed the "Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence 
of Northern America". Morelos was captured and executed on December 22, 
1815. In subsequent years, the insurgency was near collapse, but in 1820 
Viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca sent an army under the criollo general Agustín 
de Iturbide against the troops of Vicente Guerrero. Instead, Iturbide approached 
Guerrero to join forces, and on August 24, 1821 representatives of the 
Spanish Crown and Iturbide signed the "Treaty of Córdoba" and the "Declaration 
of Independence of the Mexican Empire", which recognized the independence 
of Mexico under the terms of the "Plan of Iguala". Mexico’s short recovery 
after the War of Independence was soon cut short again by the civil wars 
and institutional instability of the 1850s, which lasted until the government 
of Porfirio Díaz reestablished conditions that paved the way for economic 
growth. The conflicts that arose from the mid-1850s had a profound effect 
because they were widespread and made themselves perceptible in the vast 
rural areas of the countries, involved clashes between castes, different 
ethnic groups and haciendas, and entailed a deepening of the political 
and ideological divisions between republicans and monarchists.[67] Agustín 
de Iturbide immediately proclaimed himself emperor of the First Mexican 
Empire. A revolt against him in 1823 established the United Mexican States. 
In 1824, a Republican Constitution was drafted and Guadalupe Victoria became 
the first president of the newly born country. In 1829 president Guerrero 
abolished slavery.[68] The first decades of the post-independence period 
were marked by economic instability, which led to the Pastry War in 1836. 
There was constant strife between liberales, supporters of a federal form 
of government, and conservadores, who proposed a hierarchical form of government.[citation 
needed] During this period, the frontier borderlands to the north became 
quite isolated from the government in Mexico City, and its monopolistic 
economic policies caused suffering. With limited trade, the people had 
difficulty meeting tax payments and resented the central government's actions 
in collecting customs. Resentment built up from California to Texas. Both 
the mission system and the presidios had collapsed after the Spanish withdrew 
from the colony, causing great disruption especially in Alta California 
and New Mexico. The people in the borderlands had to raise local militias 
to protect themselves from hostile Native Americans. These areas developed 
in different directions from the center of the country.[69] Wanting to 
stabilize and develop the frontier, Mexico encouraged immigration into 
present-day Texas, as they were unable to persuade people from central 
Mexico to move into those areas. They allowed for religious freedom for 
the new settlers, who were primarily Protestant English speakers from the 
United States. Within several years, the Anglos far outnumbered the Tejano 
in the area. Itinerant traders traveled through the area, working by free 
market principles. The Tejano grew more separate from the government and 
due to its neglect, many supported the idea of independence and joined 
movements to that end, collaborating with the English-speaking Americans.[69] 
General Antonio López de Santa Anna, a centralist and two-time dictator, 
approved the Siete Leyes in 1836, a radical amendment that institutionalized 
the centralized form of government. When he suspended the 1824 Constitution, 
civil war spread across the country. Three new governments declared independence: 
the Republic of Texas, the Republic of the Rio Grande and the Republic 
of Yucatán. Texas successfully achieved independence as a republic in 1836 
and joined the United States. A border dispute between the US and Mexico 
led to the Mexican–American War, which began in 1846 and lasted for two 
years. Many Southerners intended that slavery should be extended to the 
west in these newly acquired territories but the United States generally 
would not permit it, except in Texas. The War was settled via the Treaty 
of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Mexico was forced to give up more than one-third 
of its land to the U.S., including Alta California, New Mexico, and the 
disputed parts of Texas. A much smaller transfer of territory in what is 
today southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico—known as the Gadsden 
Purchase—occurred in 1854.[70] The Caste War of Yucatán, the Mayan uprising 
that began in 1847, was one of the most successful modern Native American 
revolts.[71][72] Maya rebels, or Cruzob, maintained relatively independent 
enclaves in the peninsula until the 1930s.[73] Dissatisfaction with Santa 
Anna's return to power led to the liberal "Plan of Ayutla", initiating 
an era known as La Reforma. The new Constitution drafted in 1857 established 
a secular state, federalism as the form of government, and several freedoms. 
As the conservadores refused to recognize it, the Reform War began in 1858, 
during which both groups had their own governments. The war ended in 1861 
with victory by the Liberals, led by president Benito Juárez, who was Amerindian. 
In the 1860s Mexico was occupied by France, which established the Second 
Mexican Empire under the rule of the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian 
of Austria with support from the Roman Catholic clergy and the conservadores. 
The latter switched sides and joined the liberales. Maximilian surrendered, 
was tried on June 14, 1867, and was executed a few days later on June 19. 
Porfirio Díaz, a republican general during the French intervention, ruled 
Mexico from 1876 to 1880 and then from 1884 to 1911 in five consecutive 
reelections, period known as the Porfiriato, characterized by remarkable 
economic achievements, investments in the arts and sciences, but also of 
economic inequality and political repression.[citation needed] President 
Díaz announced in 1908 that he would retire in 1911, resulting in the development 
of new coalitions. But then he ran for reelection anyway and in a show 
of U.S. support, Díaz and William Howard Taft planned a summit in El Paso, 
Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, for October 16, 1909, an historic first 
meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president and also the first time 
an American president would cross the border into Mexico.[74] Both sides 
agreed that the disputed Chamizal strip connecting El Paso to Ciudad Juárez 
would be considered neutral territory with no flags present during the 
summit, but the meeting focused attention on this territory and resulted 
in assassination threats and other serious security concerns.[74] On the 
day of the summit, Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, and 
Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed 
palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along 
the procession route, and they disarmed the assassin within only a few 
feet of Díaz and Taft.[74] Both presidents were unharmed and the summit 
was held.[74] Díaz was re-elected in 1910, but alleged electoral fraud 
forced him into exile in France and sparked the 1910 Mexican Revolution, 
initially led by Francisco I. Madero. Madero was elected president but 
overthrown and murdered in a coup d'état two years later directed by conservative 
general Victoriano Huerta. That event re-ignited the civil war, involving 
figures such as Francisco Villa and Emiliano Zapata, who formed their own 
forces. A third force, the constitutional army led by Venustiano Carranza 
managed to bring an end to the war, and radically amended the 1857 Constitution 
to include many of the social premises and demands of the revolutionaries 
into what was eventually called the 1917 Constitution. It is estimated 
that the war killed 900,000 of the 1910 population of 15 million.[75][76] 
Assassinated in 1920, Carranza was succeeded by another revolutionary hero, 
Álvaro Obregón, who in turn was succeeded by Plutarco Elías Calles. Obregón 
was reelected in 1928 but assassinated before he could assume power. Although 
this period is usually referred to as the Mexican Revolution, it might 
also be termed a civil war since president Díaz (1909) narrowly escaped 
assassination and presidents Francisco I. Madero (1913), Venustiano Carranza 
(1920), Álvaro Obregón (1928), and former revolutionary leaders Emiliano 
Zapata (1919) and Pancho Villa (1923) all were assassinated during this 
period. In 1929, Calles founded the National Revolutionary Party (PNR), 
later renamed the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and started 
a period known as the Maximato, which ended with the election of Lázaro 
Cárdenas, who implemented many economic and social reforms. This included 
the Mexican oil expropriation in March 1938, which nationalized the U.S. 
and Anglo-Dutch oil company known as the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company. 
This movement would result in the creation of the state-owned Mexican oil 
company known as Pemex. This sparked a diplomatic crisis with the countries 
whose citizens had lost businesses by Cárdenas' radical measure, but since 
then the company has played an important role in the economic development 
of Mexico. Between 1940 and 1980, Mexico remained a poor country but experienced 
substantial economic growth that some historians call the "Mexican miracle".[77] 
Although the economy continued to flourish for some, social inequality 
remained a factor of discontent. Moreover, the PRI rule became increasingly 
authoritarian and at times oppressive in what is now referred to as 'Mexico's 
dirty war'[78] (see the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre,[79] which claimed the 
life of around 300 protesters based on conservative estimates and as many 
as 800 protesters).[80] Electoral reforms and high oil prices followed 
the administration of Luis Echeverría,[81][82] mismanagement of these revenues 
led to inflation and exacerbated the 1982 Crisis. That year, oil prices 
plunged, interest rates soared, and the government defaulted on its debt. 
President Miguel de la Madrid resorted to currency devaluations which in 
turn sparked inflation. In the 1980s the first cracks emerged in PRI's 
monopolistic position. In Baja California, Ernesto Ruffo Appel was elected 
as governor. In 1988, alleged electoral fraud prevented the leftist candidate 
Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas from winning the national presidential elections, giving 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari the presidency and leading to massive protests 
in Mexico City.[83] Salinas embarked on a program of neoliberal reforms 
which fixed the exchange rate, controlled inflation and culminated with 
the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which came 
into effect on January 1, 1994. The same day, the Zapatista Army of National 
Liberation (EZLN) started a two-week-long armed rebellion against the federal 
government, and has continued as a non-violent opposition movement against 
neoliberalism and globalization. In 1994, Salinas was succeeded by Ernesto 
Zedillo, followed by the Mexican peso crisis and a $50 billion IMF bailout. 
Major macroeconomic reforms were started by President Zedillo, and the 
economy rapidly recovered and growth peaked at almost 7% by the end of 
1999.[84] In 2000, after 71 years, the PRI lost a presidential election 
to Vicente Fox of the opposition National Action Party (PAN). In the 2006 
presidential election, Felipe Calderón from the PAN was declared the winner, 
with a very narrow margin over leftist politician Andrés Manuel López Obrador 
of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). López Obrador, however, 
contested the election and pledged to create an "alternative government".[85] 
After twelve years, in 2012, the PRI won the Presidency again with the 
election of Enrique Peña Nieto, the governor of the State of Mexico from 
2005–2011. However, he won with only a plurality of about 38%, and did 
not have a legislative majority.[86] Mexico is located between latitudes 
14° and 33°N, and longitudes 86° and 119°W in the southern portion of North 
America.[citation needed] Almost all of Mexico lies in the North American 
Plate, with small parts of the Baja California peninsula on the Pacific 
and Cocos Plates. Geophysically, some geographers include the territory 
east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (around 12% of the total) within Central 
America.[87] Geopolitically, however, Mexico is entirely considered part 
of North America, along with Canada and the United States.[88] Mexico's 
total area is 1,972,550 km2 (761,606 sq mi), making it the world's 14th 
largest country by total area, and includes approximately 6,000 km2 (2,317 sq mi) 
of islands in the Pacific Ocean (including the remote Guadalupe Island 
and the Revillagigedo Islands), Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and Gulf of 
California. From its farthest land points, Mexico is a little over 2,000 mi 
(3,219 km) in length. On its north, Mexico shares a 3,141 km (1,952 mi) 
border with the United States. The meandering Río Bravo del Norte (known 
as the Rio Grande in the United States) defines the border from Ciudad 
Juárez east to the Gulf of Mexico. A series of natural and artificial markers 
delineate the United States-Mexican border west from Ciudad Juárez to the 
Pacific Ocean. On its south, Mexico shares an 871 km (541 mi) border with 
Guatemala and a 251 km (156 mi) border with Belize. Mexico is crossed from 
north to south by two mountain ranges known as Sierra Madre Oriental and 
Sierra Madre Occidental, which are the extension of the Rocky Mountains 
from northern North America. From east to west at the center, the country 
is crossed by the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt also known as the Sierra 
Nevada. A fourth mountain range, the Sierra Madre del Sur, runs from Michoacán 
to Oaxaca.[89] As such, the majority of the Mexican central and northern 
territories are located at high altitudes, and the highest elevations are 
found at the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt: Pico de Orizaba (5,700 m or 18,701 ft), 
Popocatepetl (5,462 m or 17,920 ft) and Iztaccihuatl (5,286 m or 17,343 ft) 
and the Nevado de Toluca (4,577 m or 15,016 ft). Three major urban agglomerations 
are located in the valleys between these four elevations: Toluca, Greater 
Mexico City and Puebla.[89] The Tropic of Cancer effectively divides the 
country into temperate and tropical zones. Land north of the twenty-fourth 
parallel experiences cooler temperatures during the winter months. South 
of the twenty-fourth parallel, temperatures are fairly constant year round 
and vary solely as a function of elevation. This gives Mexico one of the 
world's most diverse weather systems. Areas south of the 24th parallel 
with elevations up to 1,000 m (3,281 ft) (the southern parts of both coastal 
plains as well as the Yucatán Peninsula), have a yearly median temperature 
between 24 to 28 °C (75.2 to 82.4 °F). Temperatures here remain high throughout 
the year, with only a 5 °C (9 °F) difference between winter and summer 
median temperatures. Both Mexican coasts, except for the south coast of 
the Bay of Campeche and northern Baja, are also vulnerable to serious hurricanes 
during the summer and fall. Although low-lying areas north of the 24th 
parallel are hot and humid during the summer, they generally have lower 
yearly temperature averages (from 20 to 24 °C or 68.0 to 75.2 °F) because 
of more moderate conditions during the winter. Many large cities in Mexico 
are located in the Valley of Mexico or in adjacent valleys with altitudes 
generally above 2,000 m (6,562 ft). This gives them a year-round temperate 
climate with yearly temperature averages (from 16 to 18 °C or 60.8 to 64.4 °F) 
and cool nighttime temperatures throughout the year. Many parts of Mexico, 
particularly the north, have a dry climate with sporadic rainfall while 
parts of the tropical lowlands in the south average more than 2,000 mm 
(78.7 in) of annual precipitation. For example, many cities in the north 
like Monterrey, Hermosillo, and Mexicali experience temperatures of 40 °C 
(104 °F) or more in summer. In the Sonoran Desert temperatures reach 50 °C 
(122 °F) or more. In 2012, Mexico passed a comprehensive climate change 
bill, a first in the developing world, that has set a goal for the country 
to generate 35% of its energy from clean energy sources by 2024, and to 
cut emissions by 50% by 2050, from the level found in 2000.[90][91] During 
the 2016 North American Leaders' Summit, the target of 50% of electricity 
generated from renewable sources by 2025 was announced.[92] Lago de Camécuaro

one of the 17 megadiverse countries of the world. With over 200,000 different 
species, Mexico is home of 10–12% of the world's biodiversity.[93] Mexico 
ranks first in biodiversity in reptiles with 707 known species, second 
in mammals with 438 species, fourth in amphibians with 290 species, and 
fourth in flora, with 26,000 different species.[94] Mexico is also considered 
the second country in the world in ecosystems and fourth in overall species.[95] 
Approximately 2,500 species are protected by Mexican legislations.[95] 
In 2002[update], Mexico had the second fastest rate of deforestation in 
the world, second only to Brazil.[96] The government has taken another 
initiative in the late 1990s to broaden the people's knowledge, interest 
and use of the country's esteemed biodiversity, through the Comisión Nacional 
para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad. In Mexico, 170,000 square 
kilometres (65,637 sq mi) are considered "Protected Natural Areas." These 
include 34 biosphere reserves (unaltered ecosystems), 67 national parks, 
4 natural monuments (protected in perpetuity for their aesthetic, scientific 
or historical value), 26 areas of protected flora and fauna, 4 areas for 
natural resource protection (conservation of soil, hydrological basins 
and forests) and 17 sanctuaries (zones rich in diverse species).[93] The 
discovery of the Americas brought to the rest of the world many widely 
used food crops and edible plants. Some of Mexico's native culinary ingredients 
include: chocolate, avocado, tomato, maize, vanilla, guava, chayote, epazote, 
camote, jícama, nopal, zucchini, tejocote, huitlacoche, sapote, mamey sapote, 
many varieties of beans, and an even greater variety of chiles, such as 
the habanero and the jalapeño. Most of these names come from indigenous 
languages like Nahuatl. Because of its high biodiversity Mexico has also 
been a frequent site of bioprospecting by international research bodies.[97] 
The first highly successful instance being the discovery in 1947 of the 
tuber "Barbasco" (Dioscorea composita) which has a high content of diosgenin, 
revolutionizing the production of synthetic hormones in the 1950s and 1960s 
and eventually leading to the invention of combined oral contraceptive 
pills.[98] The United Mexican States are a federation whose government 
is representative, democratic and republican based on a presidential system 
according to the 1917 Constitution. The constitution establishes three 
levels of government: the federal Union, the state governments and the 
municipal governments. According to the constitution, all constituent states 
of the federation must have a republican form of government composed of 
three branches: the executive, represented by a governor and an appointed 
cabinet, the legislative branch constituted by a unicameral congress and 
the judiciary, which will include called state Supreme Court of Justice. 
They also have their own civil and judicial codes. The legislature is the 
bicameral Congress of the Union, composed of the Senate of the Republic 
and the Chamber of Deputies. The Congress makes federal law, declares war, 
imposes taxes, approves the national budget and international treaties, 
and ratifies diplomatic appointments.[99] The federal Congress, as well 
as the state legislatures, are elected by a system of parallel voting that 
includes plurality and proportional representation.[100] The Chamber of 
Deputies has 500 deputies. Of these, 300 are elected by plurality vote 
in single-member districts (the federal electoral districts) and 200 are 
elected by proportional representation with closed party lists[101] for 
which the country is divided into five electoral constituencies.[102] The 
Senate is made up of 128 senators. Of these, 64 senators (two for each 
state and two for the Federal District) are elected by plurality vote in 
pairs; 32 senators are the first minority or first-runner up (one for each 
state and one for the Federal District), and 32 are elected by proportional 
representation from national closed party lists.[101] The executive is 
the President of the United Mexican States, who is the head of state and 
government, as well as the commander-in-chief of the Mexican military forces. 
The President also appoints the Cabinet and other officers. The President 
is responsible for executing and enforcing the law, and has the power to 
veto bills.[103] The highest organ of the judicial branch of government 
is the Supreme Court of Justice, the national supreme court, which has 
eleven judges appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. The 
Supreme Court of Justice interprets laws and judges cases of federal competency. 
Other institutions of the judiciary are the Federal Electoral Tribunal, 
collegiate, unitary and district tribunals, and the Council of the Federal 
Judiciary.[104] Three parties have historically been the dominant parties 
in Mexican politics: the National Action Party: a conservative party founded 
in 1939 and belonging to the Christian Democrat Organization of America;[105] 
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, a center-left party and member of 
Socialist International[106] that was founded in 1929 to unite all the 
factions of the Mexican Revolution and held an almost hegemonic power in 
Mexican politics since then; the Party of the Democratic Revolution: a 
left-wing party,[107] founded in 1989 as the successor of the coalition 
of socialists and liberal parties. Public security is enacted at the three 
levels of government, each of which has different prerogatives and responsibilities. 
Local and state police departments are primarily in charge of law enforcement, 
whereas the Mexican Federal Police are in charge of specialized duties. 
All levels report to the Secretaría de Seguridad Pública (Secretary of 
Public Security). The General Attorney's Office (Procuraduría General de 
la República, PGR) is the executive power's agency in charge of investigating 
and prosecuting crimes at the federal level, mainly those related to drug 
and arms trafficking,[108] espionage, and bank robberies.[109] The PGR 
operates the Federal Investigations Agency (Agencia Federal de Investigación, 
AFI) an investigative and preventive agency.[110] While the government 
generally respects the human rights of its citizens, serious abuses of 
power have been reported in security operations in the southern part of 
the country and in indigenous communities and poor urban neighborhoods.[111] 
The National Human Rights Commission has had little impact in reversing 
this trend, engaging mostly in documentation but failing to use its powers 
to issue public condemnations to the officials who ignore its recommendations.[112] 
By law, all defendants have the rights that assure them fair trials and 
human treatment; however, the system is overburdened and overwhelmed with 
several problems.[111] Despite the efforts of the authorities to fight 
crime and fraud, most Mexicans have low confidence in the police or the 
judicial system, and therefore, few crimes are actually reported by the 
citizens.[111] The Global Integrity Index which measures the existence 
and effectiveness of national anti-corruption mechanisms rated Mexico 31st 
behind Kenya, Thailand, and Russia.[113] In 2008, president Calderón proposed 
a major reform of the judicial system, which was approved by the Congress 
of the Union, which included oral trials, the presumption of innocence 
for defendants, the authority of local police to investigate crime—until 
then a prerogative of special police units—and several other changes intended 
to speed up trials.[114] Drug cartels are a major concern in Mexico.[115] 
Mexico's drug war has left over 60,000 dead and perhaps another 20,000 
missing.[116] The Mexican drug cartels have as many as 100,000 members.[117] 
The Mexican government's National Geography and Statistics Institute estimated 
that there were 41,563 crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012.[118] President 
Felipe Calderón made abating organized crime one of the top priorities 
of his administration by deploying military personnel to cities where drug 
cartels operate. This move was criticized by the opposition parties and 
the National Human Rights Commission for escalating the violence, but its 
effects have been positively evaluated by the US State Department's Bureau 
for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs as having obtained 
"unprecedented results" with "many important successes".[119] Since President 
Felipe Calderón launched a crackdown against cartels in 2006, more than 
28,000 alleged criminals have been killed.[120][121] Of the total drug-related 
violence 4% are innocent people,[122] mostly by-passers and people trapped 
in between shootings; 90% accounts for criminals and 6% for military personnel 
and police officers.[122] In October 2007, President Calderón and US president 
George W. Bush announced the Mérida Initiative, a plan of law enforcement 
cooperation between the two countries.[123] The foreign relations of Mexico 
are directed by the President of Mexico[124] and managed through the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs.[125] The principles of the foreign policy are constitutionally 
recognized in the Article 89, Section 10, which include: respect for international 
law and legal equality of states, their sovereignty and independence, non-intervention 
in the domestic affairs of other countries, peaceful resolution of conflicts, 
and promotion of collective security through active participation in international 
organizations.[124] Since the 1930s, the Estrada Doctrine has served as 
a crucial complement to these principles.[126] Mexico is one of the founding 
members of several international organizations, most notably the United 
Nations,[127] the Organization of American States,[128] the Organization 
of Ibero-American States,[129] the OPANAL[130] and the Rio Group.[131] 
In 2008, Mexico contributed over 40 million dollars to the United Nations 
regular budget.[132] In addition, it was the only Latin American member 
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development since it 
joined in 1994 until Chile gained full membership in 2010.[133][134] Mexico 
is considered a regional power[135][136] hence its presence in major economic 
groups such as the G8+5 and the G-20. In addition, since the 1990s Mexico 
has sought a reform of the United Nations Security Council and its working 
methods[137] with the support of Canada, Italy, Pakistan and other nine 
countries, which form a group informally called the Coffee Club.[138] After 
the War of Independence, the relations of Mexico were focused primarily 
on the United States, its northern neighbor, largest trading partner,[139] 
and the most powerful actor in hemispheric and world affairs.[140] Mexico 
supported the Cuban government since its establishment in the early 1960s,[141] 
the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua during the late 1970s,[142] and 
leftist revolutionary groups in El Salvador during the 1980s.[143] Felipe 
Calderón's administration put a greater emphasis on relations with Latin 
America and the Caribbean.[144] The Mexican Armed Forces have two branches: 
the Mexican Army (which includes the Mexican Air Force), and the Mexican 
Navy. The Mexican Armed Forces maintain significant infrastructure, including 
facilities for design, research, and testing of weapons, vehicles, aircraft, 
naval vessels, defense systems and electronics;[145][146] military industry 
manufacturing centers for building such systems, and advanced naval dockyards 
that build heavy military vessels and advanced missile technologies.[147] 
In recent years, Mexico has improved its training techniques, military 
command and information structures and has taken steps to becoming more 
self-reliant in supplying its military by designing as well as manufacturing 
its own arms,[148] missiles,[146] aircraft,[149] vehicles, heavy weaponry, 
electronics,[145] defense systems,[145] armor, heavy military industrial 
equipment and heavy naval vessels.[150] Since the 1990s, when the military 
escalated its role in the war on drugs, increasing importance has been 
placed on acquiring airborne surveillance platforms, aircraft, helicopters, 
digital war-fighting technologies,[145] urban warfare equipment and rapid 
troop transport.[151] Mexico has the capabilities to manufacture nuclear 
weapons, but abandoned this possibility with the Treaty of Tlatelolco in 
1968 and pledged to only use its nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.[152] 
In 1970, Mexico's national institute for nuclear research successfully 
refined weapons grade uranium[153][not in citation given] which is used 
in the manufacture of nuclear weapons but in April 2010, Mexico agreed 
to turn over its weapons grade uranium to the United States.[154][155] 
Historically, Mexico has remained neutral in international conflicts,[156] 
with the exception of World War II. However, in recent years some political 
parties have proposed an amendment of the Constitution in order to allow 
the Mexican Army, Air Force or Navy to collaborate with the United Nations 
in peacekeeping missions, or to provide military help to countries that 
officially ask for it.[157] The United Mexican States are a federation 
of 31 free and sovereign states, which form a union that exercises a degree 
of jurisdiction over the Federal District and other territories. Each state 
has its own constitution, congress, and a judiciary, and its citizens elect 
by direct voting a governor for a six-year term, and representatives to 
their respective unicameral state congresses for three-year terms.[158] 
The Federal District is a special political division that belongs to the 
federation as a whole and not to a particular state, and as such, has more 
limited local rule than the nation's states.[159] The states are divided 
into municipalities, the smallest administrative political entity in the 
country, governed by a mayor or municipal president (presidente municipal), 
elected by its residents by plurality.[160] Mexico has the 15th largest 
nominal GDP and the 11th largest by purchasing power parity. GDP annual 
average growth for the period of 1995–2002 was 5.1%.[82] Mexico's Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP) was estimated at 
US $2.2602 trillion in 2015, and $1.3673 trillion in nominal exchange rates.[161] 
Mexico's GDP in PPP per capita was US $18,714.05. The World Bank reported 
in 2009 that the country's Gross National Income in market exchange rates 
was the second highest in Latin America, after Brazil at US $1,830.392 billion,[162] 
which lead to the highest income per capita in the region at $14,400.[163] 
Mexico is now firmly established as an upper middle-income country. After 
the slowdown of 2001 the country has recovered and has grown 4.2, 3.0 and 
4.8 percent in 2004, 2005 and 2006,[164] even though it is considered to 
be well below Mexico's potential growth.[165] Furthermore, after the 2008–2009 
recession, the economy grew an average of 3.32 percent per year from 2010 
to 2014. From the late 1990s onwards, the majority of the population has 
been part of the growing middle class.[166] But from 2004 to 2008 the portion 
of the population who received less than half of the median income has 
risen from 17% to 21% and the absolute levels of poverty rose from 2006 
to 2010, with a rise in persons living in extreme or moderate poverty rising 
from 35 to 46% (52 million persons).[167][168] This is also reflected by 
the fact that infant mortality in Mexico is three times higher than the 
average among OECD nations, and the literacy levels are in the median range 
of OECD nations. Nevertheless, according to Goldman Sachs, by 2050 Mexico 
will have the 5th largest economy in the world.[169] Among the OECD countries, 
Mexico has the second highest degree of economic disparity between the 
extremely poor and extremely rich, after Chile – although it has been falling 
over the last decade, being only one of few countries in which this is 
the case.[170] The bottom ten percent in the income hierarchy disposes 
of 1.36% of the country's resources, whereas the upper ten percent dispose 
of almost 36%. OECD also notes that Mexico's budgeted expenses for poverty 
alleviation and social development is only about a third of the OECD average 
– both in absolute and relative numbers.[167] According to a 2008 UN report 
the average income in a typical urbanized area of Mexico was $26,654, while 
the average income in rural areas just miles away was only $8,403.[171] 
Daily minimum wages are set annually by law and determined by zone; $67.29 
Mexican pesos ($5.13 USD) in Zone A and $63.77 Mexican pesos ($4.86 USD) 
in Zone B.[172] The electronics industry of Mexico has grown enormously 
within the last decade. Mexico has the sixth largest electronics industry 
in the world after China, United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. 
Mexico is the second largest exporter of electronics to the United States 
where it exported $71.4 billion worth of electronics in 2011.[173] The 
Mexican electronics industry is dominated by the manufacture and OEM design 
of televisions, displays, computers, mobile phones, circuit boards, semiconductors, 
electronic appliances, communications equipment and LCD modules. The Mexican 
electronics industry grew 20% between 2010 and 2011, up from its constant 
growth rate of 17% between 2003 and 2009.[173] Currently electronics represent 
30% of Mexico's exports.[173] Mexico produces the most automobiles of any 
North American nation.[174] The industry produces technologically complex 
components and engages in some research and development activities.[175] 
The "Big Three" (General Motors, Ford and Chrysler) have been operating 
in Mexico since the 1930s, while Volkswagen and Nissan built their plants 
in the 1960s.[176] In Puebla alone, 70 industrial part-makers cluster around 
Volkswagen.[175] In the 2010s expansion of the sector was surging. In 2014 
alone, more than $10 billion in investment was committed. Kia Motors in 
August 2014 announced plans for a $1 billion factory in Nuevo León. At 
the time Mercedes-Benz and Nissan were already building a $1.4 billion 
plant near Puebla, while BMW was planning a $1-billion assembly plant in 
San Luis Potosí. Additionally, Audi began building a $1.3 billion factory 
near Puebla in 2013.[177] The domestic car industry is represented by DINA 
S.A., which has built buses and trucks since 1962,[178] and the new Mastretta 
company that builds the high-performance Mastretta MXT sports car.[179] 
In 2006, trade with the United States and Canada accounted for almost 50% 
of Mexico's exports and 45% of its imports.[12] During the first three 
quarters of 2010, the United States had a $46.0 billion trade deficit with 
Mexico.[180] In August 2010 Mexico surpassed France to become the 9th largest 
holder of US debt.[181] The commercial and financial dependence on the 
US is a cause for concern.[182] The remittances from Mexican citizens working 
in the United States account for 0.2% of Mexico's GDP[183] which was equal 
to US$20 billion per year in 2004 and is the tenth largest source of foreign 
income after oil, industrial exports, manufactured goods, electronics, 
heavy industry, automobiles, construction, food, banking and financial 
services.[184] According to Mexico's central bank, remittances in 2008 
amounted to $25bn.[185] Major players in the broadcasting industry are 
Televisa, the largest Spanish media company in the Spanish-speaking world,[186] 
and TV Azteca. The telecommunications industry is mostly dominated by Telmex 
(Teléfonos de México), privatized in 1990. By 2006, Telmex had expanded 
its operations to Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay 
and the United States. Other players in the domestic industry are Axtel 
and Maxcom. Because of Mexican orography, providing a landline telephone 
service at remote mountainous areas is expensive, and the penetration of 
line-phones per capita is low compared to other Latin American countries, 
at 40 percent; however, 82% of Mexicans over the age of 14 own a mobile 
phone. Mobile telephony has the advantage of reaching all areas at a lower 
cost, and the total number of mobile lines is almost two times that of 
landlines, with an estimation of 63 million lines.[187] The telecommunication 
industry is regulated by the government through Cofetel (Comisión Federal 
de Telecomunicaciones). The Mexican satellite system is domestic and operates 
120 earth stations. There is also extensive microwave radio relay network 
and considerable use of fiber-optic and coaxial cable.[187] Mexican satellites 
are operated by Satélites Mexicanos (Satmex), a private company, leader 
in Latin America and servicing both North and South America.[188] It offers 
broadcast, telephone and telecommunication services to 37 countries in 
the Americas, from Canada to Argentina. Through business partnerships Satmex 
provides high-speed connectivity to ISPs and Digital Broadcast Services.[189] 
Satmex maintains its own satellite fleet with most of the fleet being designed 
and built in Mexico. The use of radio, television, and Internet in Mexico 
is prevalent.[190] There are approximately 1,410 radio broadcast stations 
and 236 television stations (excluding repeaters).[187] Major players in 
the broadcasting industry are Televisa—the largest media company in the 
Spanish-speaking world[186]—and TV Azteca. Energy production in Mexico 
is managed by state-owned companies: the Federal Commission of Electricity 
and Pemex. Pemex, the public company in charge of exploration, extraction, 
transportation and marketing of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the 
refining and distribution of petroleum products and petrochemicals, is 
one of the largest companies in the world by revenue, making US $86 billion 
in sales a year.[192][193][194] Mexico is the sixth-largest oil producer 
in the world, with 3.7 million barrels per day.[195] In 1980 oil exports 
accounted for 61.6% of total exports; by 2000 it was only 7.3%.[175] The 
largest hydro plant in Mexico is the 2,400 MW Manuel Moreno Torres Dam 
in Chicoasén, Chiapas, in the Grijalva River. This is the world's fourth 
most productive hydroelectric plant.[196] Mexico is the country with the 
world's third largest solar potential.[197] The country's gross solar potential 
is estimated at 5kWh/m2 daily, which corresponds to 50 times national electricity 
generation.[198] Currently, there is over 1 million square meters of solar 
thermal panels[199] installed in Mexico, while in 2005, there were 115,000 
square meters of solar PV (photo-voltaic). It is expected that in 2012 
there will be 1,8 million square meters of installed solar thermal panels.[199] 
The project named SEGH-CFE 1, located in Puerto Libertad, Sonora, Northwest 
of Mexico, will have capacity of 46.8 MW from an array of 187,200 solar 
panels when complete in 2013.[200] All of the electricity will be sold 
directly to the CFE and absorbed into the utility's transmission system 
for distribution throughout their existing network. At an installed capacity 
of 46.8 MWp, when complete in 2013, the project will be the first utility 
scale project of its kind in Mexico and the largest solar project of any 
kind in Latin America. The National Autonomous University of Mexico was 
officially established in 1910,[201] and the university become one of the 
most important institutes of higher learning in Mexico.[202] UNAM provides 
world class education in science, medicine, and engineering.[203] Many 
scientific institutes and new institutes of higher learning, such as National 
Polytechnic Institute (founded in 1936),[204] were established during the 
first half of the 20th century. Most of the new research institutes were 
created within UNAM. Twelve institutes were integrated into UNAM from 1929 
to 1973.[205] In 1959, the Mexican Academy of Sciences was created to coordinate 
scientific efforts between academics. In 1995, the Mexican chemist Mario 
J. Molina shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Paul J. Crutzen and 
F. Sherwood Rowland for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly 
concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone.[206] Molina, an alumnus 
of UNAM, became the first Mexican citizen to win the Nobel Prize in science.[207] 
In recent years, the largest scientific project being developed in Mexico 
was the construction of the Large Millimeter Telescope (Gran Telescopio 
Milimétrico, GMT), the world's largest and most sensitive single-aperture 
telescope in its frequency range.[208] It was designed to observe regions 
of space obscured by stellar dust. Mexico has traditionally been among 
the most visited countries in the world according to the World Tourism 
Organization and it is the most visited country in the Americas, after 
the United States. The most notable attractions are the Mesoamerican ruins, 
cultural festivals, colonial cities, nature reserves and the beach resorts. 
The nation's wide range of climates, from temperate to tropical, and unique 
culture – a fusion of the European and the Mesoamerican – make Mexico an 
attractive destination. The peak tourism seasons in the country are during 
December and the mid-Summer, with brief surges during the week before Easter 
and Spring break, when many of the beach resort sites become popular destinations 
for college students from the United States. Mexico has the 23rd highest 
income from tourism in the world, and the highest in Latin America.[209] 
The vast majority of tourists come to Mexico from the United States and 
Canada followed by Europe and Asia. A smaller number also come from other 
Latin American countries.[210] In the 2011 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness 
Index report, Mexico was ranked 43rd in the world, which was 4th in the 
Americas .[211] The coastlines of Mexico harbor many stretches of beaches 
that are frequented by sun bathers and other visitors. On the Yucatán peninsula, 
one of the most popular beach destinations is the resort town of Cancún, 
especially among university students during spring break. Just offshore 
is the beach island of Isla Mujeres, and to the east is the Isla Holbox. 
To the south of Cancun is the coastal strip called Riviera Maya which includes 
the beach town of Playa del Carmen and the ecological parks of Xcaret and 
Xel-Há. A day trip to the south of Cancún is the historic port of Tulum. 
In addition to its beaches, the town of Tulum is notable for its cliff-side 
Mayan ruins. On the Pacific coast is the notable tourist destination of 
Acapulco. Once the destination for the rich and famous, the beaches have 
become crowded and the shores are now home to many multi-story hotels and 
vendors. Acapulco is home to renowned cliff divers: trained divers who 
leap from the side of a vertical cliff into the surf below. At the southern 
tip of the Baja California peninsula is the resort town of Cabo San Lucas, 
a town noted for its beaches and marlin fishing.[212] Further north along 
the Sea of Cortés is the Bahía de La Concepción, another beach town known 
for its sports fishing. Closer to the United States border is the weekend 
draw of San Felipe, Baja California. The roadway network in Mexico is extensive 
and all areas in the country are covered by it.[213] The roadway network 
in Mexico has an extent of 366,095 km (227,481 mi),[214] of which 116,802 km 
(72,577 mi) are paved,[215] making it the largest paved-roadway network 
in Latin America.[216] Of these, 10,474 km (6,508 mi) are multi-lane expressways: 
9,544 km (5,930 mi) are four-lane highways and the rest have 6 or more 
lanes.[215] Mexico was one of the first Latin American countries to promote 
railway development,[111] and the network covers 30,952 km (19,233 mi).[190] 
The Secretary of Communications and Transport of Mexico proposed a high-speed 
rail link that will transport its passengers from Mexico City to Guadalajara, 
Jalisco.[217][218] The train, which will travel at 300 kilometres per hour 
(190 miles per hour),[219] will allow passengers to travel from Mexico 
City to Guadalajara in just 2 hours.[219] The whole project was projected 
to cost 240 billion pesos, or about 25 billion US$[217] and is being paid 
for jointly by the Mexican government and the local private sector including 
the wealthiest man in the world, Mexico's billionaire business tycoon Carlos 
Slim.[220] The government of the state of Yucatán is also funding the construction 
of a high speed line connecting the cities of Cozumel to Mérida and Chichen 
Itza and Cancún.[221] Mexico has 233 airports with paved runways; of these, 
35 carry 97% of the passenger traffic.[190] The Mexico City International 
Airport remains the largest in Latin America and the 44th largest in the 
world[222] transporting 21 million passengers a year.[223] Among the achievements 
is a significant increase in access to piped water supply in urban areas 
(88% to 93%) as well as in rural areas (50% to 74%) between 1990 and 2010. 
Additionally, a strong nationwide increase in access to improved sanitation 
(64% to 85%) was observed in the same period. Other achievements include 
the existence of a functioning national system to finance water and sanitation 
infrastructure with a National Water Commission as its apex institution; 
and the existence of a few well-performing utilities such as Aguas y Drenaje 
de Monterrey. The challenges include water scarcity in the northern and 
central parts of the country; inadequate water service quality (drinking 
water quality; 55% of Mexicans receiving water only intermittently according 
to results of the 2000 census); poor technical and commercial efficiency 
of most utilities (with an average level of non-revenue water of 51% in 
2003); an insufficient share of wastewater receiving treatment (36% in 
2006); and still inadequate access in rural areas. In addition to on-going 
investments to expand access, the government has embarked on a large investment 
program to improve wastewater treatment. The 2010 Census[224] showed a 
population of 112,336,538, making it the most populous Spanish-speaking 
country in the world.[225] Between 2005 and 2010, the Mexican population 
grew at an average of 1.70% per year, up from 1.16% per year between 2000 
and 2005. Prior to 2015, the Mexican government did not ask for the ethnicity 
nor race of its citizens (last doing so in 1921). The number of indígenas 
(indigenous peoples) was defined narrowly to speakers of one of Mexico's 
62 indigenous languages or connections to established indigenous communities. 
As a result, the 2010 census found that 14.86% of the population was indigenous.[226] 
However, beginning with the 2015 inter-census estimate, the government 
now asks whether an individual self-identifies as indigenous (21.5% of 
the population) and/or Afro-Mexican (1.2% of the population).[227] These 
categories are not exclusionary and an individual can indicate both indigenous 
and afro-descendant heritage. No other groups (such as mestizos, whites 
or Asian-descendants) are quantified by the government. As of 2015[update], 
the foreign-born population was 1,007,063.[228] The majority of these individuals 
were born in the United States and Mexico is home to the largest number 
of U.S. citizens abroad.[229] After Americans the largest immigrant groups 
are Guatemalans, Spaniards and Colombians. Besides the Spanish, large immigrant-descended 
groups are the French, Germans, Lebanese and Chinese. Mexico is the largest 
source of immigration to the United States.[230] Some 11.6 million residents 
of the United States have Mexican citizenship as of 2014[update].[231] 
Mexico is ethnically diverse; the various indigenous peoples, whites, afro-descendants 
and mestizos are united under a single national identity.[232] The core 
part of Mexican national identity is formed on the basis of a synthesis 
of cultures, primarily European culture and indigenous cultures, in a process 
known as mestizaje, alluding to the mixed biological origins of the majority 
of Mexicans.[232][233] Mexican politicians and reformers such as José Vasconcelos 
(promoter of the cosmic race) and Manuel Gamio (promoter of indigenismo) 
were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity on the concept 
of mestizaje.[234] In 1810, towards the end of the Colonial era, the population 
of Mexico was estimated to be about 6 million (based on the 1793 Revillagigedo 
Census and the 1803 estimate by geographer Alexander Humboldt and 1810 
estimate by royal accountant Francisco Navarro y Noriega). From these population 
estimates, anthropologist Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán approximated the following 
in regards to race and ethnicity: there were some 15,000 peninsulares (expelled 
after independence), less than 10,000 Africans (mostly enslaved, legally 
freed in 1829), more than a million "Euromestizos" (criollos and individuals 
of primarily European descent, such as castizos), some 700,000 "Indomestizos" 
(individuals of significant indigenous descent), some 600,000 "Afromestizos" 
(individuals of significant African descent, such as mulatos) and some 
3.7 million indigenous peoples.[235] Mexico does not ask about race in 
its census in part because it eliminated the legal basis of the Colonial 
caste system (based on race and birth) after independence. A large majority 
of Mexicans have been classified as "Mestizos" (between 50% to 67% according 
to the Encyclopædia Britannica).[236] In modern Mexico, the term mestizo 
is primarily a cultural identity rather than the racial identity it was 
during the colonial era, resulting in individuals with varying phenotypes 
being classified under the same identity. The term is not in wide use in 
Mexican society, although often used in literature about Mexican social 
identities. Since the term carries a variety of socio-cultural, economic, 
racial and biological meanings, it was deemed too imprecise to be used 
for ethnic classification and was abandoned in Mexican censuses.[111][237] 
Various genetic studies have found that Mexico's population is not uniform 
in its genetic composition, with there being significant regional variation.[238][239][240] 
According to the country's Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica, on 
average mestizos of primarily European ancestry predominate in the north 
while mestizos from the southern region have predominately indigenous ancestry.[240] 
Mestizos from the center of the country have a more even contribution from 
Europeans and Natives, while the highest African contribution was found 
in the southwest and Veracruz.[240] In the Yucatán peninsula the word Mestizo 
is even used about Maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities, 
because during the Caste War of the late 19th century those Maya who did 
not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos.[241] In Chiapas the 
word "Ladino" is used instead of mestizo.[242] Estimates of the number 
of whites range from 10% to 20% according to the Encyclopædia Britannica.[236] 
The numbers very since the criteria to define mestizo might be different 
from study to study and in Mexico some number of white people have been 
historically classified as mestizos since the Mexican government defined 
ethnicity on cultural standards as opposed to racial ones.[243] During 
the colonial and independent era, most of the European migration into Mexico 
was Spanish. However, in the 19th and 20th centuries a substantial number 
of non-Spanish Europeans immigrated to the country. However, at its height, 
the total immigrant population in Mexico never exceeded two percent of 
the total.[244] Some of these immigrants, along with non-European immigrants, 
were forced out of the country as a result of the Mexican Revolution. Mexico's 
northern regions have the greatest European population and admixture. According 
to the last racial census Mexico took, which was in 1921,[245] there were 
no states in Mexico that had a majority "white" population, and in virtually 
every state in the north Mestizos were the largest population group.[245] 
The only state where "whites" outnumbered Mestizos was Sonora, in which 
"whites" composed 41.85% of the population, and Mestizos 40.38%.[245] The 
absolute indigenous population of Mexico (26,694,928 individuals as of 
2015[update])[227] is growing, but at a slower rate than the rest of the 
population so that the percentage of indigenous peoples in regards to total 
population is nonetheless falling.[246] The majority of the indigenous 
population is concentrated in the central and southern states, primarily 
in rural areas. Some indigenous communities have a degree of autonomy under 
the legislation of "usos y costumbres", which allows them to regulate some 
internal issues under customary law. According to the National Commission 
for the Development of Indigenous Peoples, the states with the greatest 
proportion of indigenous residents are:[247] Yucatán at 59%, Quintana Roo 
39% and Campeche 27%, chiefly Maya; Oaxaca with 48% of the population, 
the most numerous groups being the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples; Chiapas 
at 28%, the majority being Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya; Hidalgo 24%, the majority 
being Otomi; Puebla 19%, and Guerrero 17%, mostly Nahua peoples and the 
states of San Luis Potosí and Veracruz both home to a population that is 
15% indigenous, mostly from the Totonac, Nahua and Teenek (Huastec) groups.[248] 
All of the indices of social development for the indigenous population 
are considerably lower than the national average. In all states indigenous 
people have higher infant mortality, in some states almost double of the 
non-indigenous populations. Literacy rates are also much lower, with 27% 
of indigenous children between 6 and 14 being illiterate compared to a 
national average of 12%. The indigenous population participate in the workforce 
longer than the national average, starting earlier and continuing longer. 
However, 55% of the indigenous population receive less than a minimum salary, 
compared to 20% for the national average. Many practice subsistence agriculture 
and receive no salaries. Indigenous people also have less access to health 
care and a lower quality of housing.[248] The Afro-Mexican population (1,381,853 
individuals as of 2015[update])[227] is an ethnic group made up of descendants 
of Colonial-era slaves and recent immigrants of sub-Saharan African descent. 
Mexico had an active slave trade during the colonial period and some 200,000 
Africans were taken there, primarily in the 17th century. The creation 
of a national Mexican identity, especially after the Mexican Revolution, 
emphasized Mexico's indigenous and European past; it passively eliminated 
the African ancestors and contributions. Most of the African-descended 
population was absorbed into the surrounding Mestizo (mixed European/indigenous) 
and indigenous populations through unions among the groups. Evidence of 
this long history of intermarriage with Mestizo and indigenous Mexicans 
is also expressed in the fact that in the 2015 inter-census, 64.9% (896,829) 
of Afro-Mexicans also identified as indigenous. It was also reported that 
9.3% of Afro-Mexicans speak an indigenous language.[249] The states with 
the highest self-report of Afro-Mexicans were Guerrero (6.5% of the population), 
Oaxaca (4.95%) and Veracruz (3.28%).[250] Afro-Mexican culture is strongest 
in the communities of the Costa Chica of Oaxaca and Costa Chica of Guerrero. 
Smaller ethnic groups in Mexico include South and East Asians, present 
since the colonial era. During the colonial era Asians were termed Chino 
(regardless of ethnicity), and arrived as merchants, artisans and slaves.[251] 
The largest group were Filipinos and some 200,000 Mexicans can trace Filipino 
ancestry.[252] Modern Asian immigration began in the late 19th century 
and at one point in the early 20th century, the Chinese were the second 
largest immigrant group.[253] During the early 20th century, a substantial 
number of Arabs (mostly Christians)[254] began arriving from the crumbling 
Ottoman Empire. The largest group were the Lebanese and an estimated 400,000 
Mexicans have some Lebanese ancestry.[255] The country has the largest 
Spanish-speaking population in the world with almost a third of all Spanish 
native speakers.[225][256] Almost all of the Mexican population speaks 
Spanish, 99.3% according to the latest census,[257] nonetheless around 
5.4% still speaks an indigenous language besides Spanish. The indigenous 
languages with most speakers are Nahuatl, spoken by approximately 1.45 
million people,[258] Yukatek Maya spoken by some 750,000 people and the 
Mixtec[259] and Zapotec languages[260] each spoken by more than 400,000 
people. The National Institute of Indigenous Languages INALI recognizes 
68 linguistic groups and some 364 different specific varieties of indigenous 
languages.[261] Since the promulgation of the Law of Indigenous Linguistic 
Rights in 2003, these languages have had status as national languages, 
with equal validity with Spanish in all the areas and contexts in which 
they are spoken.[262] In addition to the indigenous languages, other minority 
languages are spoken by immigrant populations, such as the 80,000 German-speaking 
Mennonites in Mexico,[263] and 5,000 the Chipilo dialect of the Venetian 
language spoken in Chipilo, Puebla. English is the most common foreign 
language in Mexico.[264] Here are the 20 largest urban areas in Mexico. 
The 2010 census by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (National 
Institute of Statistics and Geography) gave Roman Catholicism as the main 
religion, with 83% of the population, while 10% (10,924,103) belong to 
other Christian denominations, including Evangelicals (5%); Pentecostals 
(1.6%); other Protestant or Reformed (0.7%); Jehovah's Witnesses (1.4%); 
Seventh-day Adventists (0.6%); and members of The Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints (0.3%).[267] 172,891 (or less than 0.2% of the total) 
belonged to other, non-Christian religions; 4.7% declared having no religion; 
2.7% were unspecified.[267] The 92,924,489[267] Catholics of Mexico constitute 
in absolute terms the second largest Catholic community in the world, after 
Brazil's.[268] 47% percent of them attend church services weekly.[269] 
The feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, is 
celebrated on December 12 and is regarded by many Mexicans as the most 
important religious holiday of their country.[270] The 2010 census reported 
314,932 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,[267] 
though the church in 2009 claimed to have over one million registered members.[271] 
About 25% of registered members attend a weekly sacrament service although 
this can fluctuate up and down.[272] The presence of Jews in Mexico dates 
back to 1521, when Hernán Cortés conquered the Aztecs, accompanied by several 
Conversos.[273] According to the 2010 census, there are 67,476 Jews in 
Mexico.[267] Islam in Mexico is practiced by a small population in the 
city of Torreón, Coahuila, and there are an estimated 300 Muslims in the 
San Cristóbal de las Casas area in Chiapas.[274][275] In the 2010 census 
18,185 Mexicans reported belonging to an Eastern religion,[267] a category 
which includes a tiny Buddhist population. Until the twentieth century, 
Mexico was an overwhelmingly rural country, with rural women's status defined 
within the context of the family and local community. With urbanization 
beginning in the sixteenth century, following the Spanish conquest of the 
Aztec empire, cities have provided economic and social opportunities not 
possible within rural villages. Roman Catholicism in Mexico has shaped 
societal attitudes about women's social role, emphasizing the role of women 
as nurturers of the family, with the Virgin Mary as a model. Marianismo 
has been an ideal, with women's role as being within the family under the 
authority of men. In the twentieth century, Mexican women made great strides 
toward toward a more equal legal and social status. In 1953, women in Mexico 
were granted the vote in national elections. Mexican women face discrimination 
and at times harassment from the machismo population. Although women in 
Mexico are making big advancements they are faced with the traditional 
expectations of being the head of the household. Researcher Margarita Valdés 
noted that while there are few inequalities enforced by law or policy in 
Mexico, there are gender inequalities perpetuated by social structures 
and Mexican cultural expectations that limit the capabilities of Mexican 
women.[276] As of 2014[update], Mexico has the 16th highest rate of homicides 
committed against women in the world [277] The prevalence of domestic violence 
against women in Mexican marital relationships varies at between 30 and 
60 percent of relationships.[278] The remains of the victims were frequently 
mutilated.[279] According to a 1997 study, domestic abuse in Mexican culture 
"is embedded in gender and marital relations fostered in Mexican women's 
dependence on their spouses for subsistence and for self-esteem, sustained 
by ideologies of romantic love, by family structure and residential arrangements."[280] 
The perpetrators are often the boyfriend, father-in-law, ex-husbands or 
husbands but only 1.6% of the murder cases led to an arrest and sentencing.[279] 
Mexican culture reflects the complexity of the country's history through 
the blending of indigenous cultures and the culture of Spain, imparted 
during Spain's 300-year colonization of Mexico. Exogenous cultural elements 
have been incorporated into Mexican culture as time has passed. The Porfirian 
era (el Porfiriato), in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first 
decade of the 20th century, was marked by economic progress and peace. 
After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development 
of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President Díaz himself. Since that 
time, as accentuated during the Mexican Revolution, cultural identity has 
had its foundation in the mestizaje, of which the indigenous (i.e. Amerindian) 
element is the core. In light of the various ethnicities that formed the 
Mexican people, José Vasconcelos in his publication La Raza Cósmica (The 
Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races (thus 
extending the definition of the mestizo) not only biologically but culturally 
as well.[281] Mexican literature has its antecedents in the literatures 
of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica. The most well known prehispanic 
poet is Nezahualcoyotl. Modern Mexican literature was influenced by the 
concepts of the Spanish colonialization of Mesoamerica. Outstanding colonial 
writers and poets include Juan Ruiz de Alarcón and Juana Inés de la Cruz. 
Other writers include Alfonso Reyes, José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi, 
Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, Carlos Fuentes, Octavio Paz (Nobel Laureate), 
Renato Leduc, Carlos Monsiváis, Elena Poniatowska, Mariano Azuela ("Los 
de abajo") and Juan Rulfo ("Pedro Páramo"). Bruno Traven wrote "Canasta 
de cuentos mexicanos" (Mexican tales basket), "El tesoro de la Sierra Madre" 
(Treasure of the Sierra Madre). Post-revolutionary art in Mexico had its 
expression in the works of renowned artists such as David Alfaro Siqueiros, 
Federico Cantú Garza, Frida Kahlo, Juan O'Gorman, José Clemente Orozco, 
Diego Rivera, and Rufino Tamayo. Diego Rivera, the most well-known figure 
of Mexican muralism, painted the Man at the Crossroads at the Rockefeller 
Center in New York City, a huge mural that was destroyed the next year 
because of the inclusion of a portrait of Russian communist leader Lenin.[282] 
Some of Rivera's murals are displayed at the Mexican National Palace and 
the Palace of Fine Arts. Mesoamerican architecture is mostly noted for 
its pyramids which are the largest such structures outside of Ancient Egypt.[citation 
needed] Spanish Colonial architecture is marked by the contrast between 
the simple, solid construction demanded by the new environment and the 
Baroque ornamentation exported from Spain.[citation needed] Mexico, as 
the center of New Spain has some of the most renowned buildings built in 
this style. Mexican films from the Golden Age in the 1940s and 1950s are 
the greatest examples of Latin American cinema, with a huge industry comparable 
to the Hollywood of those years. Mexican films were exported and exhibited 
in all of Latin America and Europe. Maria Candelaria (1943) by Emilio Fernández, 
was one of the first films awarded a Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival 
in 1946, the first time the event was held after World War II. The famous 
Spanish-born director Luis Buñuel realized in Mexico, between 1947 and 
1965 some of him master pieces like Los Olvidados (1949) and Viridiana 
(1961). Famous actors and actresses from this period include María Félix, 
Pedro Infante, Dolores del Río, Jorge Negrete and the comedian Cantinflas. 
More recently, films such as Como agua para chocolate (1992), Cronos (1993), 
Y tu mamá también (2001), and Pan's Labyrinth (2006) have been successful 
in creating universal stories about contemporary subjects, and were internationally 
recognized, as in the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. Mexican directors 
Alejandro González Iñárritu (Amores perros, Babel, Birdman, The Revenant), 
Alfonso Cuarón (Children of Men, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, 
Gravity), Guillermo del Toro, Carlos Carrera (The Crime of Father Amaro), 
screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and photographer Emmanuel Lubezki are some 
of the most known present-day film makers. Some Mexican actors have achieved 
recognition as Hollywood stars. These include Ramon Novarro, Dolores del 
Río, Lupe Vélez, Gilbert Roland, Anthony Quinn, Katy Jurado, Ricardo Montalbán 
and Salma Hayek There are two major television companies in Mexico that 
own the four primary networks that broadcast to 75% of the population. 
They are Televisa, which owns the Canal de las Estrellas and Canal 5 networks, 
and TV Azteca, which owns the Azteca 7 and Azteca Trece networks. Televisa 
is also the largest producer of Spanish-language content in the world and 
also the world's largest Spanish-language media network.[283] Grupo Multimedios 
is another media conglomerate with Spanish-language broadcasting in Mexico, 
Spain, and the United States. The telenovelas are very traditional in Mexico 
and are translated to many languages and seen all over the world with renowned 
names like Verónica Castro, Lucía Méndez and Thalía. Mexican society enjoys 
a vast array of music genres, showing the diversity of Mexican culture. 
Traditional music includes mariachi, banda, norteño, ranchera and corridos; 
on an everyday basis most Mexicans listen to contemporary music such as 
pop, rock, etc. in both English and Spanish. Mexico has the largest media 
industry in Latin America, producing Mexican artists who are famous in 
Central and South America and parts of Europe, especially Spain. Some well-known 
Mexican singers are Thalía, Luis Miguel, Juan Gabriel, Alejandro Fernández, 
Julieta Venegas, Jose Jose and Paulina Rubio. Mexican singers of traditional 
music are: Lila Downs, Susana Harp, Jaramar, GEO Meneses and Alejandra 
Robles. Popular groups are Café Tacuba, Caifanes, Molotov and Maná, among 
others. Since the early years of the 2000s (decade), Mexican rock has seen 
widespread growth both domestically and internationally.[citation needed] 
According to the Sistema Nacional de Fomento Musical, there are between 
120 and 140 youth orchestras affiliated to this federal agency from all 
federal states.[citation needed] Some states, through their state agencies 
in charge of culture and the arts—Ministry or Secretary or Institute or 
Council of Culture, or in some cases the Secretary of Education or the 
State University—sponsor the activities of a professional symphony orchestra 
or philharmonic crchestra so all citizens can have access to this artistic 
expression from the field of classical music. Mexico City is the most intense 
hub of this activity, hosting 12 professional orchestras sponsored by different 
agencies such as the National Institute of Fine Arts, the Secretary of 
Culture of the Federal District, The National University, the National 
Polytechnic Institute, a Delegación Política (Coyoacán) and private ventures.[citation

decoration, and variety of spices. Most of today's Mexican food is based 
on pre-Columbian traditions, including Aztec and Maya, combined with culinary 
trends introduced by Spanish colonists. The conquistadores eventually combined 
their imported diet of rice, beef, pork, chicken, wine, garlic and onions 
with the native pre-Columbian food, including maize, tomato, vanilla, avocado, 
guava, papaya, pineapple, chili pepper, beans, squash, sweet potato, peanut, 
and turkey. Mexican food varies by region, because of local climate and 
geography and ethnic differences among the indigenous inhabitants and because 
these different populations were influenced by the Spaniards in varying 
degrees. The north of Mexico is known for its beef, goat and ostrich production 
and meat dishes, in particular the well-known Arrachera cut. Central Mexico's 
cuisine is largely made up of influences from the rest of the country, 
but also has its authentics, such as barbacoa, pozole, menudo, tamales, 
and carnitas. Southeastern Mexico, on the other hand, is known for its 
spicy vegetable and chicken-based dishes. The cuisine of Southeastern Mexico 
also has quite a bit of Caribbean influence, given its geographical location. 
Veal is common in the Yucatan. Seafood is commonly prepared in the states 
that border the Pacific Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico, the latter having 
a famous reputation for its fish dishes, in particular à la veracruzana. 
In modern times, other cuisines of the world have become very popular in 
Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, sushi in Mexico is 
often made with a variety of sauces based on mango or tamarind, and very 
often served with serrano-chili-blended soy sauce, or complemented with 
vinegar, habanero and chipotle peppers The most internationally recognized 
dishes include chocolate, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas, burritos, tamales 
and mole among others. Regional dishes include mole poblano, chiles en 
nogada and chalupas from Puebla; cabrito and machaca from Monterrey, cochinita 
pibil from Yucatán, Tlayudas from Oaxaca, as well as barbacoa, chilaquiles, 
milanesas, and many others. Mexico City hosted the XIX Olympic Games in 
1968, making it the first Latin American city to do so.[286] The country 
has also hosted the FIFA World Cup twice, in 1970 and 1986.[287] Mexico's 
most popular sport is association football. It is commonly believed that 
football was introduced in Mexico by Cornish miners at the end of the 19th 
century. By 1902 a five-team league had emerged with a strong British influence.[288][289] 
Mexico's top clubs are América with 12 championships, Guadalajara with 
11, and Toluca with 10.[290] Antonio Carbajal was the first player to appear 
in five World Cups,[291] and Hugo Sánchez was named best CONCACAF player 
of the 20th century by IFFHS.[292] The Mexican professional baseball league 
is named the Liga Mexicana de Beisbol. While usually not as strong as the 
United States, the Caribbean countries and Japan, Mexico has nonetheless 
achieved several international baseball titles.[citation needed] Mexican 
teams have won the Caribbean Series nine times. Mexico has had several 
players signed by Major League teams, the most famous of them being Dodgers 
pitcher Fernando Valenzuela. In 2013, Mexico's basketball team won the 
Americas Basketball Championship and qualified for the 2014 Basketball 
World Cup where it reached the playoffs. Because of these achievements 
the country earned the hosting rights for the 2015 FIBA Americas Championship.[293] 
Bullfighting is a popular sport in the country, and almost all large cities 
have bullrings. Plaza México in Mexico City, is the largest bullring in 
the world, which seats 55,000 people. Professional wrestling (or Lucha 
libre in Spanish) is a major crowd draw with national promotions such as 
AAA, LLL, CMLL and others. Mexico is an international power in professional 
boxing (at the amateur level, several Olympic boxing medals have also been 
won by Mexico). Vicente Saldivar, Rubén Olivares, Salvador Sánchez, Julio 
César Chávez, Ricardo Lopez and Erik Morales are but a few Mexican fighters 
who have been ranked among the best of all time.[294] Notable Mexican athletes 
include golfer Lorena Ochoa, who was ranked first in the LPGA world rankings 
prior to her retirement,[295] Ana Guevara, former world champion of the 
400 metres (1,300 ft) and Olympic subchampion in Athens 2004, Fernando 
Platas, four-time Olympic medal winning diver, and taekwondo fighter María 
Espinoza, most decorated Mexican female Olympian. Since the early 1990s, 
Mexico entered a transitional stage in the health of its population and 
some indicators such as mortality patterns are identical to those found 
in highly developed countries like Germany or Japan.[296] Mexico's medical 
infrastructure is highly rated for the most part and is usually excellent 
in major cities,[297][298] but rural communities still lack equipment for 
advanced medical procedures, forcing patients in those locations to travel 
to the closest urban areas to get specialized medical care.[111] Social 
determinants of health can be used to evaluate the state of health in Mexico. 
State-funded institutions such as Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) 
and the Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers (ISSSTE) 
play a major role in health and social security. Private health services 
are also very important and account for 13% of all medical units in the 
country.[299] Medical training is done mostly at public universities with 
much specializations done in vocational or internship settings. Some public 
universities in Mexico, such as the University of Guadalajara, have signed 
agreements with the U.S. to receive and train American students in Medicine. 
Health care costs in private institutions and prescription drugs in Mexico 
are on average lower than that of its North American economic partners.[297] 
In 2004, the literacy rate was at 97%[300] for youth under the age of 14 
and 91% for people over 15,[301] placing Mexico at the 24th place in the 
world rank according to UNESCO.[302] The National Autonomous University 
of Mexico ranks 190th place in the Top 200 World University Ranking published 
by The Times Higher Education Supplement in 2009.[303] Private business 
schools also stand out in international rankings. IPADE and EGADE, the 
business schools of Universidad Panamericana and of Monterrey Institute 
of Technology and Higher Education respectively, were ranked in the top 
10 in a survey conducted by The Wall Street Journal among recruiters outside
