Alan Duane Embree (born January 23, 1970) is a former Major League Baseball 
relief pitcher. Embree played for the Cleveland Indians (1992–1996), Atlanta 
Braves (1997–1998), Arizona Diamondbacks (1998), San Francisco Giants (1999–2001), 
Chicago White Sox (2001), San Diego Padres (2002 & 2006), Boston Red Sox 
(2002–2005), New York Yankees (2005), Oakland Athletics (2007–2008), and 
the Colorado Rockies (2009). He bats and throws left-handed, and was used 
as a left-handed specialist. His nickname is "The Gas". Embree attended 
Prairie High School in Brush Prairie, Washington and was a letterman in 
football, basketball, baseball. In baseball, he won All-Conference honors. 
Embree relies primarily on two pitches: a 90 to 95 MPH four-seam fastball, 
and a sharp slider that is very effective when he can keep it down. In 
his younger days, Embree's fastball was clocked as high as 96 to 98 mph. 
During his time with the Red Sox, he began to throw his fastball at slightly 
lower velocity in order to avoid injuring his arm. He also refined his 
slider into an effective pitch, whereas before, he had relied almost exclusively 
on his blazing fastball. He is particularly difficult for left-handed hitters, 
and he is not afraid to throw inside. An excellent fielder, he has a good 
move to first that keeps runners close. From 1992 through 2004, Embree 
had posted a 28-28 record with a 4.38 ERA and seven saves in 568 games.[1] 
In 2004, Embree recorded the final out against the New York Yankees in 
Game 7 of the 2004 ALCS. The Red Sox went on to win the World Series and 
Embree received his World Series ring on Opening Day, 2005. In 2005 with 
the Boston Red Sox, Embree's record was 1-4 with a 7.65 ERA in 43 outings.[1] 
As a result of these sub-par numbers, Embree was designated for assignment 
on July 19.[2] He was signed by the New York Yankees on July 30 to replace 
Buddy Groom who was designated for assignment.[3] On December 6, 2006 it 
was announced that Embree agreed to a two-year deal with the Oakland Athletics 
including an option for the 2009 season.[4] Embree spent the bulk of his 
time serving as the team's closer while Huston Street was injured for a 
prolonged period.[5] On December 13, 2008 it was announced that Embree 
had agreed to a one-year deal with the Colorado Rockies for the 2009 season 
and an option for the 2010 season.[6] On July 7, 2009 Embree became only 
the second pitcher since 1990 to be awarded a win without throwing a single 
pitch. This is because he was able to pick a man off at 1st base.[7] On 
July 10, 2009, Embree's right tibia was broken after he was struck in the 
leg by a line drive off the bat of Atlanta Brave Martín Prado. The injury 
required surgery and caused Embree to miss the rest of the 2009 season.[8] 
On March 20, 2010, the Boston Red Sox signed Embree to a Minor League contract 
with a Major League Spring Training invitation.[9] Embree had a clause 
in his contract that would grant him a release by April 15 if he was not 
on the major league roster. He opted to remain with the Boston organization 
and was called up on April 28. However, he was designated for assignment 
on May 1 without appearing in a game.[10] On May 11, 2010, the Chicago 
White Sox signed Embree and assigned him to the Triple A Charlotte Knights. 
On Nov 8, 2012, Embree was named the Pitching Coach for the Bend Elks Baseball 
Club in Bend, Oregon.[11] The Bend Elks are an amateur baseball team from 
Bend, Oregon. The team is a founding member of the wooden-bat West Coast 
League, a collegiate summer baseball league in Oregon, Washington and British 
Columbia that began play in 2005. Alan resides in Bend, Oregon with wife
