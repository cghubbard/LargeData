The Western Carolinas League was a Class D (1948–52; 1960–62) and a low 
Class A (1963–79) full-season league in American minor league baseball. 
The WCL changed its name prior to the 1980 season and has been known since 
as the South Atlantic League, a highly successful low Class A circuit with 
teams up the Eastern Seaboard from Georgia to New Jersey. Originally called 
the "Western Carolina League", the 1948–52 WCL was composed exclusively 
of teams located in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge sections of western North 
Carolina. It merged with the North Carolina State League to form the short-lived 
Class D Tar Heel League, which lasted only 1½ seasons (1953–54) before 
folding. In 1960, the WCL was revived as a Class D circuit intended for 
farm teams of member clubs of a planned third major league, the Continental 
League. It featured teams in eight North Carolina locales: Gastonia, Hickory, 
Lexington, Newton–Conover, Rutherford County, Salisbury, Shelby and Statesville, 
but soon expanded to sites in South Carolina. When the CL was torpedoed 
by the Major League Baseball expansion in 1961 and 1962, the members of 
the Western Carolinas League became affiliates of American and National 
League clubs. It was upgraded to Class A in the 1963 reorganization of 
the minor leagues. The first professional baseball team based in Monroe, 
North Carolina came into being when the Statesville Indians moved into 
town on June 20, 1969 and finished the year as the Monroe Indians. The 
team lasted just one season before being replaced by the Sumter Indians. 
For nearly 60 years, 1948 through 2007, the dominant figure in the WCL/SAL 
was league founder and president John Henry Moss, who started the WCL as 
a young man in 1948, refounded it in 1960 and then led it into the new 
century. Moss, also the longtime mayor of Kings Mountain, North Carolina, 
retired at the close of the 2007[1] Sally League season and died, at age
