Charles Grant Jr. (August 31, 1874 â€“ July 9, 1932)[5] was an African American 
second baseman in Negro League baseball. Grant nearly crossed the baseball 
color line decades before Jackie Robinson when Major League Baseball manager 
John McGraw attempted to pass him off as a Native American named "Tokohama".[6] 
Grant was born in Cincinnati, the son of an African American horse trainer.[7][8] 
A good fielder, Grant was of "medium height" and weighed approximately 
160 pounds and hit right-handed.[7][9] When star second baseman Sol White 
left the Page Fence Giants after just one season, Charlie Grant replaced 
him in 1896.[10] Grant and Page Fence defeated White's new team, the Cuban 
X-Giants, ten games to five to win an 1896 championship series played in 
various southern Michigan towns.[11] Page Fence disbanded in 1899 and Grant 
moved with most of the players to the Columbia Giants of Chicago.[12] He 
also captained the Columbia Giants for at least part of one season.[6] 
After spending 1900 with Columbia, Grant was working as a bellhop at the 
Eastland Hotel in Hot Springs, Arkansas in March 1901. John McGraw and 
the new American League's Baltimore Orioles began training that season 
in Hot Springs and staying at the Eastland. McGraw saw Grant playing baseball 
with his co-workers around the hotel and recognized that Grant had a level 
of talent suitable for the major leagues.[13] McGraw decided to disguise 
the light-skinned, straight-haired Grant as a Cherokee and gave him the 
name Charlie Tokohama, anecdotally after noticing a creek named "Tokohama" 
on a map in the hotel.[7][12][13] McGraw's scheme began unravelling when 
the team travelled to Chicago, where Grant had played for the previous 
few years. To celebrate Grant's return, his African American friends staged 
a conspicuous ceremony, including a flower bouquet.[14] Chicago White Sox 
President Charles Comiskey soon objected to "Tokohama" and affirmed that 
he was actually Grant.[15] Grant maintained his disguise, claiming that 
his father was white and that his mother was Cherokee and living in Lawrence, 
Kansas.[16] McGraw initially persisted but later claimed that "Tokohama" 
was inexperienced, especially on defense, and left him off his Opening 
Day roster. Grant returned to the Columbia Giants and never played in the 
major leagues.[8] Grant played for the Cuban X-Giants in 1903.[7] After 
Sol White's Philadelphia Giants were defeated in the 1903 "colored championship", 
White overhauled the team including hiring Charlie Grant to replace Frank 
Grant (no relation).[10][17] In 1905, Charlie Grant, White, shortstop Grant 
Johnson and third baseman Bill Monroe were considered one of the best infields 
in Negro League history.[18] Grant and the Giants won the championship 
in 1906. He also played for the Fe club in 1906.[5] He later played for 
the Lincoln Giants, Quaker Giants, New York Black Sox and Cincinnati Stars, 
last playing in 1916.[7] Grant's 1918 Draft card reveals he was living 
at 802 Blair Avenue in Cincinnati, Ohio. He lists his mother as a contact 
at the same address. And he also lists his employment as "janitor" at the 
same address as his home, through a company called "Thomas Emery and Sons."[19] 
In July 1932, Grant was killed in an unusual accident. While seated in 
front of a Cincinnati apartment building where he worked as a janitor, 
a passing automobile hit him after its tire exploded.[7] Grant was buried 
in Spring Grove Cemetery and his grave is a short distance from fellow
