Frank Joseph Corridon [Fiddler] (November 25, 1880 – February 21, 1941) 
was a pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for three teams between 
the 1904 and 1910 seasons. Listed at 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) 170 lb., Corridon 
was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. He was born in Newport, Rhode 
Island. The invention of the spitball has been credited to several pitchers. 
Corridon is one of them. He claimed to have originated the pitch while 
playing for the Providence Grays of the International League, when discovered 
that a ball which had landed in a puddle and was wet on one side did an 
unexpected effect on its flight when he threw it. He later wet the ball 
during games and went on to have a respectable major league career. Corridon 
entered the majors in 1904 with the Chicago Cubs, appearing for them in 
24 games before joining the Philadelphia Phillies (1904–1905, 1907–1909) 
and St. Louis Cardinals (1910). His most productive season came with the 
1907 Phillies, when he posted career-numbers in wins (18), starts (32), 
complete games (23) and innings pitched (274.0), while collecting a 2.46 
ERA. He finished 14–10 with a 2.51 ERA the next season, and went 11–7 with 
a career-high 2.11 in 1909. He faded to 6–14 with the Cardinals in 1910, 
his last major league season. In a six-year career, Corridon posted a 70–67 
record with a 2.80 ERA in 180 appearances, including 140 starts, 99 complete 
games, 10 shutouts, seven saves and 1216.0 innings of work, posting a 1.22 
strikeout-to-walk ratio (458-to-375). Corridon died at the age of 60 in
