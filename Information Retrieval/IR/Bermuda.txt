the Atlantic Ocean  (blue) Bermuda /bɜːrˈmjuːdə/ is a British Overseas 
Territory in the North Atlantic Ocean, off the east shore of North America 
about 1,070 km (665 mi) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, 
1,236 km (768 mi) south of Cape Sable Island, Canada, and 1,578 km (981 mi) 
north of San Juan, Puerto Rico and lies 1,544 km (959 mi) north of Road 
Town, British Virgin Islands. The island lies west-northwest of Cape Verde, 
southeast of New York City, New York, USA and north-northwest of Brazil, 
Suriname, Guyana and French Guiana (France). The capital city is Hamilton. 
The first known European explorer to reach Bermuda was Spanish sea captain 
Juan de Bermúdez in 1503, after whom the islands are named. He claimed 
the apparently uninhabited islands for the Spanish Empire. Bermúdez never 
landed on the islands, but made two visits to the archipelago, of which 
he created a recognisable map. Shipwrecked Portuguese mariners are now 
thought to have been responsible for the 1543 inscription on Portuguese 
Rock (previously called Spanish Rock).[6] Subsequent Spanish or other European 
parties are believed to have released pigs there, which had become feral 
and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began. In 1609, 
the English Virginia Company, which had established Jamestown in Virginia 
two years earlier, permanently settled Bermuda in the aftermath of a hurricane, 
when the crew and passengers of the Sea Venture steered the ship onto the 
surrounding reef to prevent its sinking, then landed ashore. The island 
was administered as an extension of Virginia by the Company until 1614. 
Its spin-off, the Somers Isles Company, took over in 1615 and managed the 
colony until 1684. At that time, the company's charter was revoked, and 
the English Crown took over administration. The islands became a British 
colony following the 1707 unification of the parliaments of Scotland and 
England, which created the Kingdom of Great Britain. After 1949, when Newfoundland 
became part of Canada, Bermuda was automatically ranked as the oldest remaining 
British Overseas Territory. Since the transfer of Hong Kong to China in 
1997, it is the most populous Territory. Its first capital, St. George's, 
was established in 1612 and is the oldest continuously inhabited English 
town in the New World.[7] Bermuda's economy is based on offshore insurance 
and reinsurance, and tourism, the two largest economic sectors.[7][8] Bermuda 
had one of the world's highest GDP per capita for most of the 20th century[9] 
and several years beyond. Recently, its economic status has been affected 
by the global recession. It has a subtropical climate.[10] Bermuda is the 
northernmost point of the Bermuda Triangle, a region of sea in which, according 
to legend, a number of aircraft and surface vessels have disappeared under 
supposedly unexplained or mysterious circumstances. The island is in the 
hurricane belt and prone to severe weather. However, it is somewhat protected 
from the full force of a hurricane by the coral reef that surrounds the 
island.[11] Bermuda is a group of low-forming volcanoes in the Atlantic 
Ocean, near the western edge of the Sargasso Sea, roughly 578 nautical 
miles (1,070 km (665 mi)) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras[12] on the Outer 
Banks of North Carolina and about 594 nautical miles (1,100 km (684 mi)) 
southeast of Martha's Vineyard of Massachusetts. It is 898 nautical miles 
(1,664 km (1,034 mi)) northeast of Miami, Florida, and 667 nautical miles 
(1,236 km (768 mi)) from Cape Sable Island, in Nova Scotia, Canada. The 
islands lie due east of Fripp Island, South Carolina, west-northwest of 
Cape Verde, southeast of New York City, New York, north-northwest of Brazil 
and north of San Juan, Puerto Rico.[13] The archipelago is formed by high 
points on the rim of the caldera of a submarine volcano that forms a seamount. 
The volcano is one part of a range that was formed as part of the same 
process that formed the floor of the Atlantic and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. 
The top of the seamount has gone through periods of complete submergence, 
during which its limestone cap was formed by marine organisms, and in the 
Ice Ages the entire caldera was above sea level, forming an island of approximately 
two hundred square miles. It has 103 km (64 mi) of coastline. The two incorporated 
municipalities in Bermuda are the City of Hamilton and the Town of St George. 
Bermuda is divided into nine parishes, which have some localities called 
villages, such as Flatts Village and Somerset Village. Although usually 
referred to in the singular, the territory consists of 181[14] islands, 
with a total area of 53.3 square kilometres (20.6 square miles). The largest 
island is Main Island, sometimes called Bermuda. Compiling a list of the 
islands is often complicated, as many have more than one name (as does 
the entire archipelago, which has also been known historically as La Garza, 
Virgineola, and the Isle of Devils. Somers Isles is often rendered "Somers 
Islands", or mistaken for "Summer Isles"). Despite the small land mass, 
place names are repeated: two islands named Long Island, three bays named 
Long Bay (on Somerset, Main, and Cooper's islands), two Horseshoe Bays 
(one in Southampton, on the Main Island, the other at Morgan's Point, formerly 
Tucker's Island), two roads through cuttings called Khyber Pass, one in 
Warwick, the other in St. George's Parish, and two St George's Towns on 
St George's Island in St George's Parish, each known as St George's. There 
is a Hamilton Parish in addition to the City of Hamilton in Pembroke Parish. 
Bermuda is divided into nine parishes and two incorporated municipalities. 
Bermuda's nine parishes are: Bermuda's two incorporated municipalities 
are: Bermuda's two informal villages are: Jones Village in Warwick, Cashew 
City (St. George's), Claytown (Hamilton), Middle Town (Pembroke), and Tucker's 
Town (St. George's) are neighbourhoods; Dandy Town and North Village are 
sports clubs, and Harbour View Village is a small public housing development. 
Bermuda's pink sand beaches and clear, cerulean blue ocean waters are popular 
with tourists. Many of Bermuda's hotels are located along the south shore 
of the island. In addition to its beaches, there are a number of sightseeing 
attractions. Historic St George's is a designated World Heritage Site. 
Scuba divers can explore numerous wrecks and coral reefs in relatively 
shallow water (typically 30–40 ft or 9–12 m in depth), with virtually unlimited 
visibility. Many nearby reefs are readily accessible from shore by snorkellers, 
especially at Church Bay. Bermuda's most popular visitor attraction is 
the Royal Naval Dockyard, which includes the Bermuda Maritime Museum. Other 
attractions include the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo,[15] Bermuda Underwater 
Exploration Institute, the Botanical Gardens and Masterworks Museum of 
Bermuda Art, lighthouses, and the Crystal Caves with stalactites and underground 
saltwater pools. It is not possible to rent a car on the island; public 
transport is available or visitors can hire scooters for use as private 
transport. Bermuda has a humid subtropical climate[10][16] (Köppen Cfa) 
on the border of tropical climate. Bermuda is warmed by the nearby Gulf 
Stream, and low latitude. The islands do get some cooler temperatures in 
January, February, and March (average 63 °F (17 °C)-64 °F (18 °C)).[17] 
The lowest temperature on record was 43 °F (6 °C). There has never been 
a frost or freeze on record in Bermuda. Summertime heat index in Bermuda 
can be high, although mid-August temperatures rarely exceed 30 °C (86 °F). 
The highest recorded temperature was 34 °C (93 °F) in August 1989.[18] 
Bermuda is in the hurricane belt. Along the Gulf Stream, it is often directly 
in the path of hurricanes recurving in the westerlies, although they usually 
begin to weaken as they approach Bermuda, whose small size means that direct 
landfalls of hurricanes are rare. The most recent hurricane to cause significant 
damage to Bermuda was category 3 Hurricane Nicole which struck the island 
directly on 14 October 2016. Before that, Hurricane Fabian on 5 September 
2003 was the last major hurricane to hit Bermuda directly. The only source 
of fresh water in Bermuda is rainfall, which is collected on roofs and 
catchments (or drawn from underground lenses) and stored in tanks. Each 
dwelling usually has at least one of these tanks forming part of its foundation. 
The law requires that each household collect rainwater that is piped down 
from the roof of each house. The average annual temperature of the Atlantic 
Ocean around Bermuda is 22.8 °C (73.0 °F), from 18.6 °C (65.5 °F) in February 
to 28.2 °C (82.8 °F) in August.[19] Bermuda is on the same parallel as 
the Portuguese archipelago Madeira a few time zones farther east in the 
Atlantic. The two archipelagos are the only land in the Atlantic on the 
32nd parallel north. The two have a relatively similar climate, but Bermuda 
has warmer and wetter summers, much like the typical subtropical coastal 
region of North America on similar parallels. However, winter temperatures 
between Hamilton and Madeira's capital Funchal are nearly identical. When 
discovered, Bermuda was uninhabited and mostly dominated by forests of 
Bermuda cedar, with mangrove marshes along its shores. Only 165 of the 
island's current 1,000 vascular plant species are considered native. Of 
those, 15, including the eponymous cedar, are endemic. Settlers have introduced 
many species of palm trees to Bermuda. Coconut palms are found on Bermuda, 
making it the northernmost location for the natural growth of this species. 
However, the climate is usually too cool to allow the palms to properly 
set fruit. The only indigenous mammals of Bermuda are five species of bats, 
all of which are also found in the eastern United States: Lasionycteris 
noctivagans, Lasiurus borealis, Lasiurus cinereus, Lasiurus seminolus and 
Perimyotis subflavus.[22] Other commonly known fauna of Bermuda include 
its national bird, the Bermuda petrel or cahow. It was rediscovered in 
1951 after having been thought extinct since the 1620s. It is important 
as an example of a Lazarus species. The government has a programme to protect 
it, including restoration of a habitat area. The Bermuda rock skink was 
long thought to have been the only indigenous land vertebrate of Bermuda, 
discounting the marine turtles that lay their eggs on its beaches. Recently 
through genetic DNA studies, scientists have discovered that a species 
of turtle, the diamondback terrapin, previously thought to have been introduced, 
pre-dated the arrival of humans in the archipelago.[23] As this species 
spends most of its time in brackish ponds, some question whether it should 
be classified as a land vertebrate to compete with the skink's unique status. 
Bermuda's 2010 Census put Bermuda's population at 64,237 and, with an area 
of 53.2 km2 (20.5 sq mi), it has a calculated population density of 1207/km². 
To get this in a wider context, an average population density of 53/km² 
was found for the "World (land only, excluding Antarctica)" as of July 
5, 2014. The racial makeup of Bermuda as recorded by the 2010 census, was 
54% black, 31% white, 8% multiracial, 4% Asian, and 4% other races, although 
these numbers are based on self-identification, and the majority of those 
who answered "black" have any mixture of black, white and indigenous American 
ancestry.[3] Native-born Bermudians made up 67% of the population, compared 
to 29% non-natives. The island experienced large-scale immigration over 
the 20th century, especially after the Second World War. Bermuda has a 
diverse population including both those with relatively deep roots in Bermuda 
extending back for centuries, and newer communities whose ancestry results 
from recent immigration, especially from Britain, North America, the West 
Indies, and the Portuguese Atlantic islands (especially the Azores), although 
these groups are steadily merging. About 46% of the population identified 
themselves with Bermudian ancestry in 2010, which was a decrease from the 
51% who did so in the 2000 census. Those identifying with British ancestry 
dropped by 1% to 11% (although those born in Britain remain the largest 
non-native group at 3,942 persons). The number of people born in Canada 
declined by 13%. Those who reported West Indian ancestry were 13%. The 
number of people born in the West Indies actually increased by 538. A significant 
segment of the population is of Portuguese ancestry (10%), the result of 
immigration over the past 160 years,[24] of whom 79% have residency status. 
The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured 
by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries. There is effectively 
no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those 
characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this 
was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants 
of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of 
Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been 
Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their 
homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included 
Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black 
chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by 
Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian 
and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away 
as Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians 
had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation 
of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and 
the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority 
groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic 
group, "coloured" (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly 
of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority. Any child 
born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been 
added to the coloured statistic. Most of those historically described as 
"coloured" are today described as "black", or "of African heritage", which 
obscures their non-African heritage (those previously described as "coloured" 
who were not of African ancestry had been very few, though the numbers 
of South Asians, particularly, is now growing. The number of persons born 
in Asian countries doubled between the 2000 and the 2010 censuses), blacks 
have remained in the majority, with new white immigration from Portugal, 
Britain and elsewhere countered by black immigration from the West Indies. 
Bermuda's modern black population contains more than one demographic group. 
Although the number of residents born in Africa is very small, it has tripled 
between 2000 and 2010 (this group also includes non-blacks). The majority 
of blacks in Bermuda can be termed "Bermudian blacks", whose ancestry dates 
back centuries between the 17th century and the end of slavery in 1834, 
Bermuda's black population was self-sustaining, with its growth resulting 
largely from natural expansion. This contrasts to the enslaved blacks of 
the plantation colonies, who were subjected to conditions so harsh as to 
drop their birth rate below the death rate, and slaveholders in the United 
States and the West Indies found it necessary to continue importing more 
enslaved blacks from Africa until the end of slavery (the same had been 
true for the Native Americans that the Africans had replaced on the New 
World plantations). The indigenous populations of many West Indian islands, 
and much of the South-East of what is now the United States that had survived 
the 16th- and 17th-century epidemics of European-introduced diseases then 
became the victims of large-scale slave raiding, with much of the region 
completely depopulated. When the supply of indigenous slaves ran out, the 
slaveholders looked to Africa. The ancestry of Bermuda's black population 
is distinguished from that of the British West Indian black population 
in two ways: firstly, the higher degree of European and Native American 
admixture; secondly, the source of the African ancestry. In the British 
West Indian islands (and also in the United States), the majority of enslaved 
blacks brought across the Atlantic came from West Africa (roughly between 
modern Senegal and Ghana). Very little of Bermuda's original black emigration 
came from this area. The first blacks to arrive in Bermuda in any numbers 
were free blacks from Spanish-speaking areas of the West Indies, and most 
of the remainder were recently enslaved Africans captured from the Spanish 
and Portuguese. As Spain and Portugal sourced most of their slaves from 
South-West Africa (the Portuguese through ports in modern-day Angola; the 
Spanish purchased most of their African slaves from Portuguese traders, 
and from Arabs whose slave trading was centred in Zanzibar). Genetic studies 
have consequently shown that the African ancestry of black Bermudians (other 
than those resulting from recent immigration from the British West Indian 
islands) is largely from the a band across southern Africa, from Angola 
to Mozambique, which is similar to what is revealed in Latin America, but 
distinctly different from the blacks of the West Indies and the United 
States. Most of Bermuda's black population trace some of their ancestry 
to Native Americans, although awareness of this is largely limited to St 
David's Islanders and most who have such ancestry are unaware of it. During 
the colonial period, hundreds of Native Americans were shipped to Bermuda. 
The best-known examples were the Algonquian peoples who were exiled from 
the southern New England colonies and sold into slavery in the 17th century, 
notably in the aftermaths of the Pequot and King Philip's wars. Today several 
thousand expatriate workers, principally from Britain, Canada, the West 
Indies, South Africa and the US, reside in Bermuda. They are primarily 
engaged in specialised professions such as accounting, finance, and insurance. 
Others are employed in various trades, such as hotels, restaurants, construction, 
and landscaping services. Of the total workforce of 38,947 persons in 2005, 
government employment figures stated that 11,223 (29%) were non-Bermudians.[25] 
The predominant language on Bermuda is Bermudian English. It exhibits characteristics 
of British, West Indian, and American English. Perhaps most interesting 
is its closeness to acrolectal English compared to other varieties in the 
West Indies. British English spellings and conventions are used in print 
media and formal written communications.[26] Portuguese is also spoken 
in Bermuda;[27] this is owing to immigration from Portugal, particularly 
from the Azores, and Cape Verde.[28] Bermuda's culture is a mixture of 
the various sources of its population: Native American, Spanish-Caribbean, 
English, Irish, and Scots cultures were evident in the 17th century, and 
became part of the dominant British culture. English is the primary and 
official language. Due to 160 years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic 
islands (primarily the Azores, though also from Madeira and the Cape Verde 
Islands), a portion of the population also speaks Portuguese. There are 
strong British influences, together with Afro-Caribbean ones. A second 
wave of immigration from the West Indies was sustained throughout the 20th 
century; the more recent arrivals have primarily come from English-speaking 
countries, also bringing aspects of their cultures. This new infusion of 
West Indians has both accelerated social and political change, and diversified 
Bermuda's culture. The first notable, and historically important, book 
credited to a Bermudian was The History of Mary Prince, a slave narrative 
by Mary Prince. It is thought to have contributed to the abolition of slavery 
in the British Empire. Ernest Graham Ingham, an expatriate author, published 
his books at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century, 
numerous books were written and published locally, though few were directed 
at a wider market than Bermuda. (The latter consisted primarily of scholarly 
works rather than creative writing). The novelist Brian Burland (1931– 
2010) achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally. More recently, 
Angela Barry has won critical recognition for her published fiction. Bermuda's 
proximity to the United States, as well as its origin as part of Virginia, 
means that many aspects of US culture are reflected in, or incorporated 
into, Bermudian culture. Many non-Bermudian writers have also made Bermuda 
their home, or have had homes here, including A. J. Cronin and F. Van Wyck 
Mason, who wrote on Bermudian subjects. Actors such as Ernest Trimingham, 
Oona O'Neill, Earl Cameron, Diana Dill, Lena Headey, Will Kempe, and most 
famously, Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, grew up here or have 
lived here as adults. Other native or resident film and television figures 
in Bermuda include producer Arthur Rankin, Jr., and cartoonist and Muppet 
man, Michael Frith. West Indian musicians introduced calypso music when 
Bermuda's tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought 
by post-Second World War aviation. While calypso appealed more to the visitors 
than to the locals, reggae has been embraced by many Bermudians since the 
1970s with the influx of Jamaican immigrants. Bermuda's early literature 
consisted of non-Bermudian writers commenting on the island. These included 
John Smith's The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer 
Isles (1624), and Edmund Waller's poem, "Battle of the Summer Islands" 
(1645).[29][30] Music and dance are important in Bermuda. Noted musicians 
have included local icons The Talbot Brothers, who performed for many decades 
both in Bermuda and the United States, and appeared on the Ed Sullivan 
Show; jazz pianist Lance Hayward, singer-songwriter Heather Nova and her 
brother Mishka; tenor Gary Burgess, classical musician and conductor Kenneth 
Amis and, more recently, dancehall artist Collie Buddz. Bermuda is the 
only placename in the New World specifically mentioned in the works of 
Shakespeare, in The Tempest in Act 1, Scene 2, line 230: "the still-vexed 
Bermoothes". The dances of the colourful Gombey dancers, seen at many events, 
are strongly influenced by African, Caribbean, Native American and British 
cultural traditions. In summer 2001 they performed in Washington, DC at 
the Smithsonian Folklife Festival on the Mall (see photo). Bermudian Gina 
Swainson was crowned "Miss World" in 1979. Bermuda hosts an annual international 
film festival, which shows many independent films. One of the founders 
is film producer and director Arthur Rankin, Jr., co-founder of the Rankin/Bass 
production company.[31] Bermuda watercolours painted by local artists are 
sold at various galleries. Hand-carved cedar sculptures are another speciality. 
One such 7 ft (2.1 m) sculpture, created by Bermudian sculptor Chesley 
Trott, is installed at the airport's baggage claim area. In 2010, his sculpture 
The Arrival was unveiled near the bay to commemorate the freeing of slaves 
from the American brig Enterprise in 1835. Local artwork may also be viewed 
at several galleries around the island. Alfred Birdsey was one of the more 
famous and talented watercolourists; his impressionistic landscapes of 
Hamilton, St George's and the surrounding sailboats, homes, and bays of 
Bermuda are world-renowned. Local resident Tom Butterfield founded the 
Masterworks Museum of Bermuda Art in 1986, initially featuring works about 
Bermuda by artists from other countries. He began with pieces by American 
artists, such as Winslow Homer, Charles Demuth, and Georgia O'Keeffe, who 
had lived and worked here. He has increasingly supported the development 
of local artists, arts education, and the arts scene.[32] In 2008, the 
museum opened its new building, constructed within the Botanic Gardens.[33] 
Bermuda was discovered in 1503 by Spanish explorer Juan de Bermúdez.[34] 
It is mentioned in Legatio Babylonica, published in 1511 by historian Pedro 
Mártir de Anglería, and was also included on Spanish charts of that year. 
Both Spanish and Portuguese ships used the islands as a replenishment spot 
to take on fresh meat and water. Legends arose of spirits and devils, now 
thought to have stemmed from the calls of raucous birds (most likely the 
Bermuda petrel, or Cahow) and the loud noise heard at night from wild hogs. 
Combined with the frequent storm-wracked conditions and the dangerous reefs, 
the archipelago became known as the Isle of Devils. Neither Spain nor Portugal 
attempted to settle it. For the next century, the island is believed to 
have been visited frequently, but not settled. After the failure of the 
first two English colonies in Virginia, a more determined effort was initiated 
by King James I of England (James VI of Scotland), who granted a Royal 
Charter to the Virginia Company. It established a colony at Jamestown, 
Virginia, in 1607. Two years later, a flotilla of seven ships left England 
under the Company's Admiral, Sir George Somers, and the new Governor of 
Jamestown, Sir Thomas Gates, with several hundred settlers, food and supplies 
to relieve the colony of Jamestown.[35] Somers had previous experience 
sailing with both Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh. The flotilla 
was broken up by a storm. As the flagship, the Sea Venture, was taking 
on water, Somers drove it onto Bermuda's reef and gained the shores safely 
with smaller boats – all 150 passengers and a dog survived. (William Shakespeare's 
play The Tempest, in which the character Ariel refers to the "still-vex'd 
Bermoothes" (I.ii.229), is thought to have been inspired by William Strachey's 
account of this shipwreck.)[36] They stayed 10 months, starting a new settlement 
and building two small ships to sail to Jamestown. The group of islands 
were claimed for the English Crown, and the charter of the Virginia Company 
was later extended to include them. In 1610, all but three of the survivors 
of the Sea Venture sailed on to Jamestown. Among them was John Rolfe, whose 
wife and child died and were buried in Bermuda. Later in Jamestown he married 
Pocahontas, a daughter of the powerful Powhatan, leader of a large confederation 
of about 30 Algonquian-speaking tribes in coastal Virginia. In 1612, the 
English began intentional settlement of Bermuda with the arrival of the 
ship Plough. St. George's was settled that year and designated as Bermuda's 
first capital. It is the oldest continually inhabited English town in the 
New World.[7] In 1615, the colony was passed to a new company, the Somers 
Isles Company, named after the admiral who saved his passengers from the 
Sea Venture.[37][38] Many Virginian place names refer to the archipelago, 
such as Bermuda City, and Bermuda Hundred. The first English coins to circulate 
in North America were struck in Bermuda. Because of its limited land area, 
Bermuda has had difficulty with over-population. In the first two centuries 
of settlement, it relied on steady human emigration to keep the population 
manageable.[citation needed] Before the American Revolution more than ten 
thousand Bermudians (over half of the total population through the years) 
gradually immigrated, primarily to the Southern United States. As Great 
Britain displaced Spain as the dominant European imperial power, it opened 
up more land for colonial development. A steady trickle of outward migration 
continued. With seafaring the only real industry in the early decades, 
by the end of the 18th century, at least a third of the island's manpower 
was at sea at any one time. The archipelago's limited land area and resources 
led to the creation of what may be the earliest conservation laws of the 
New World. In 1616 and 1620 acts were passed banning the hunting of certain 
birds and young tortoises.[39] In 1649, the English Civil War was in its 
seventh year and King Charles I was beheaded in Whitehall, London. In Bermuda, 
related tensions resulted in civil war on the island; it was ended by militias. 
The majority of colonists developed a strong sense of devotion to the Crown. 
Dissenters, such as Puritans and Independents, were pushed to settle the 
Bahamas under William Sayle.[40] Bermuda and Virginia, as well as Antigua 
and Barbados were, however, the subjects of an Act of the Rump Parliament 
which was essentially a declaration of war. An Act prohibiting Trade with 
Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego, specified that: due punishment 
[be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the 
said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, 
abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly 
joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by 
the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique 
with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, 
and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, 
to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia 
and Antego, or either of them. All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may 
be surprised. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till 
judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship 
to be examined upon oath. The Royalist colonies were also threatened with 
invasion. The Government of Bermuda eventually reached an agreement with 
the Parliamentarians in England which left the status quo in Bermuda. In 
the 17th century, the Somers Isles Company suppressed shipbuilding, as 
it needed Bermudians to farm in order for it to generate income from the 
land. Agricultural production met with limited success, however, due to 
limited areas available for cultivation, high alkilinity of the soil, and 
the depletion of the soil quality that resulted from excessive farming. 
The Bermuda cedar boxes used to ship tobacco to England were reportedly 
worth more than their contents.[citation needed] The colony of Virginia 
far surpassed Bermuda in both quality and quantity of tobacco produced. 
Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th 
century, but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress 
turning away from agriculture. This interference led to the islanders demanding, 
and receiving, the revocation of the Company's charter in 1684, and the 
Company was dissolved. Bermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding, 
replanting farmland with the native juniper (Juniperus bermudiana, called 
Bermuda cedar) trees that grew thickly over the entire island. Establishing 
effective control over the Turks Islands, Bermudians deforested their landscape 
to begin the salt trade. It became the world's largest and remained the 
cornerstone of Bermuda's economy for the next century. Bermudian sailors 
and merchants relied on more than the export of salt, however. They vigorously 
pursued whaling, privateering, and the merchant trade. Vessels sailed the 
normal shipping routes, but were required to engage an enemy vessel no 
matter the size or strength. As a result, many ships were destroyed.[citation 
needed] The Bermuda sloop became highly regarded for its speed and manoeuverability, 
and was soon adapted for service with the Royal Navy. The Bermuda sloop 
HMS Pickle carried despatches of the victory at Trafalgar, and news of 
the death of Admiral Nelson, to England. American independence led to great 
changes for Bermuda. Prior to the war, with no useful landmass or natural 
resources, Bermuda was largely ignored and left to its own devices by the 
London government. By being so deeply involved in trade, Bermuda merchants 
and financiers had played roles out of proportion to the colony's size 
in relation to the development of the Triangle Trade, and the trans-Atlantic 
English and British empires. Its people were settlers and founders of new 
colonies, especially in the American South. Its merchant fleet and a web 
of expatriate Bermudian merchants dominated trade through a number of American 
Atlantic Seaboard ports and the West Indies. Bermudians fished for cod 
on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, and were involved in the lumber industry 
in Central America. Most importantly, they dominated the North American 
salt trade with de facto control of the Turks Islands. The close economic, 
family, and historical ties ensured Bermudians were strongly sympathetic 
with the rebels at the start of the War. They supplied the rebels illegally 
with ships, salt and gunpowder. As the war progressed, economic realities 
caused Bermudians to seize opportunities; they turned to privateering against 
the Americans. The end of the war, however, was to cause profound change 
in Bermuda, though some of those changes would take decades to crystallise. 
Following the war, with the buildup of Naval and military forces in Bermuda, 
the primary leg of the Bermudian economy became defence infrastructure. 
Even after tourism began later in the 19th century, Bermuda remained, in 
the eyes of London, a base more than a colony. The Crown strengthened its 
political and economic ties to Bermuda, and the colony's independence on 
the world stage was diminished. The war had removed Bermuda's primary trading 
partners, the American colonies, from the empire, and dealt a harsh blow 
to Bermuda's merchant shipping trade. This also suffered due to the deforestation 
of Bermuda, as well as the advent of metal ships and steam propulsion, 
for which it did not have raw materials. During the course of the following 
War of 1812, the primary market for Bermuda's salt disappeared as the Americans 
developed their own sources. Control of the Turks had passed to the Bahamas 
in 1819. By the end of the 19th century, except for naval and military 
facilities, Bermuda was considered a quiet, rustic backwater. It had been 
superseded in the development of the English-speaking Atlantic world. After 
the American Revolution, the Royal Navy began improving the harbours. In 
1811, it started building the large dockyard on Ireland Island, in the 
west of the chain, to serve as its principal naval base guarding the western 
Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes. To guard it, the British Army built up a 
large Bermuda Garrison, and heavily fortified the archipelago. During the 
War of 1812 between Britain and the United States, the British attacks 
on Washington, D.C. and the Chesapeake were planned and launched from Bermuda, 
where the headquarters of the Royal Navy's North American Station had recently 
been moved from Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1816, James Arnold, the son of 
Benedict Arnold, fortified Bermuda's Royal Naval Dockyard against possible 
US attacks.[41] Today, the National Museum of Bermuda, which incorporates 
the "Maritime Museum", occupies the Keep of the Royal Naval Dockyard, including 
the Commissioner's House, and exhibits artefacts of the base's military 
history. As a result of Bermuda's proximity to the southeastern US coast, 
during the American Civil War Confederate States blockade runners used 
it as a base for runs to the South to evade Union naval vessels and deliver 
much needed war goods from England. The old Globe Hotel in St George's, 
which was a centre of intrigue for Confederate agents, is preserved as 
a public museum. During the Anglo-Boer War (1899–1902), 5,000 Boer prisoners 
of war were housed on five islands of Bermuda. They were located according 
to their views of the war. "Bitterenders" (Afrikaans: Bittereinders), who 
refused to pledge allegiance to the British Crown, were interned on Darrell's 
Island and closely guarded. Other islands such as Morgan's Island held 
884 men, including 27 officers; Tucker's Island held 809 Boer prisoners, 
Burt's Island 607, and Port's Island held 35.[42] The New York Times reported 
an attempted mutiny by Boer prisoners of war en route to Bermuda and that 
martial law was enacted on Darrell's Island,[43] in addition to the escape 
of three Boer prisoners to mainland Bermuda,[44] a young Boer soldier stowed 
away and sailed from Bermuda to New York on the steamship Trinidad.[45] 
The most famous escapee was the Boer prisoner of war Captain Fritz Joubert 
Duquesne who was serving a life sentence for "conspiracy against the British 
government and on (the charge of) espionage.".[46] On the night of 25 June 
1902, Duquesne slipped out of his tent, worked his way over a barbed-wire 
fence, swam 1.5 miles (2.4 km) past patrol boats and bright spot lights, 
through storm-wracked, using the distant Gibbs Hill Lighthouse for navigation 
until he arrived ashore on the main island.[47] From there he escaped to 
the port of St. George's and a week later, he stowed away on a boat heading 
to Baltimore, Maryland.[48] He settled in the US and later became a spy 
for Germany in both World Wars. He claimed to be responsible for the 1916 
death of Lord Herbert Kitchener in the sinking of HMS Hampshire, the head 
of the British Army who had also commanded British forces in South Africa 
during the second Boer War, but this had resulted from a mine. In 1942, 
Col. Duquesne was arrested by the FBI for leading the Duquesne Spy Ring, 
which still to this day the largest espionage case in the history of the 
United States.[49] Lord Kitchener's brother, Lt. Gen. Sir Walter Kitchener, 
had been the Governor of Bermuda from 1908 until his death in 1912. His 
son, Major Hal Kitchener, bought Hinson's Island (with his partner, Major 
Hemming, another First World War aviator). The island had formerly been 
part of the Boer POW camp, housing teenaged prisoners from 1901 to 1902. 
In the early 20th century, as modern transport and communication systems 
developed, Bermuda became a popular destination for American, Canadian 
and British tourists arriving by sea. The United States 1930 Smoot-Hawley 
Tariff Act enacted protective tariffs. It cut off Bermuda's once-thriving 
agricultural export trade to the US and encouraged its development of tourism 
as an alternative. After several failed attempts, in 1930 the first aeroplane 
reached Bermuda. A Stinson Detroiter seaplane flying from New York City, 
it had to land twice in the ocean: once because of darkness and again to 
refuel. Navigation and weather forecasting improved in 1933 when the Royal 
Air Force (then responsible for providing equipment and personnel for the 
Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm) established a station at the Royal Naval Dockyard 
to repair (and supply replacement) float planes for the fleet. In 1936 
Luft Hansa began to experiment with seaplane flights from Berlin via the 
Azores with continuation to New York City.[50] In 1937, Imperial Airways 
and Pan American World Airways began operating scheduled flying-boat airline 
services from New York and Baltimore to Darrell's Island, Bermuda. In 1948, 
regularly scheduled commercial airline service by land-based aeroplanes 
began to Kindley Field (now L.F. Wade International Airport), helping tourism 
to reach its peak in the 1960s–1970s. By the end of the 1970s, international 
business had supplanted tourism as the dominant sector of Bermuda's economy 
(see Economy of Bermuda). The Royal Naval Dockyard, and the attendant military 
garrison, continued to be important to Bermuda's economy until the mid-20th 
century. In addition to considerable building work, the armed forces needed 
to source food and other materials from local vendors. Beginning in World 
War II, US military installations also were located in Bermuda (see "Military" 
section below and Military of Bermuda). Universal adult suffrage and the 
development of a two-party political system occurred in the 1960s. Before 
universal suffrage, adopted as part of Bermuda's Constitution in 1967, 
voting was dependent on a certain level of property ownership. (see "Politics" 
section, below, and Politics of Bermuda). On 10 March 1973, the Governor 
of Bermuda Richard Sharples was assassinated by local Black Power militants 
during a period of civil unrest. The current ruling party in Bermuda is 
the One Bermuda Alliance, commonly referred to as the OBA. They were voted 
into power in December 2012 after Bermuda was ruled by the Progressive 
Labour Party for 14 years, from 1998 to 2012. Executive authority in Bermuda 
is vested in the monarch and is exercised on her behalf by the Governor. 
The governor is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the British Government. 
Prior to August 2016, the governor was George Fergusson, who was sworn 
in on 23 May 2012.[51] There is also a Deputy Governor (currently David 
Arkley JP).[52] Defence and foreign affairs are carried out by the United 
Kingdom, which also retains responsibility to ensure good government. It 
must approve any changes to the Constitution of Bermuda. Bermuda is classified 
as a British Overseas Territory, but it is the oldest British colony. In 
1620, a Royal Assent granted Bermuda limited self-governance; its Parliament 
is the fifth oldest in the world, behind the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 
the Tynwald of the Isle of Man, the Althing of Iceland, and Sejm of Poland.[53] 
Of these, only Bermuda's and the Isle of Man's Tynwald have been in continuous 
existence since 1620.[54] The Constitution of Bermuda came into force on 
1 June 1967; it was amended in 1989 and 2003. The head of government is 
the premier. A cabinet is nominated by the premier and appointed officially 
by the governor. The legislative branch consists of a bicameral parliament 
modelled on the Westminster system. The Senate is the upper house, consisting 
of 11 members appointed by the governor on the advice of the premier and 
the leader of the opposition. The House of Assembly, or lower house, has 
36 members, elected by the eligible voting populace in secret ballot to 
represent geographically defined constituencies. Elections must be called 
at no more than five-year intervals. The most recent took place on 17 December 
2012. Following this election, the One Bermuda Alliance took power, with 
Craig Cannonier succeeding Paula Cox, of the Progressive Labour Party, 
as Premier.[55][56] There are few accredited diplomats in Bermuda. The 
United States maintains the largest diplomatic mission in Bermuda, comprising 
both the United States Consulate and the US Customs and Border Protection 
Services at the L.F. Wade International Airport. The current US Consul 
General is Robert Settje, who took office in August 2012. The United States 
is Bermuda's largest trading partner (providing over 71% of total imports, 
85% of tourist visitors, and an estimated $163 billion of US capital in 
the Bermuda insurance/re-insurance industry), and an estimated 5% of Bermuda 
residents are US citizens, representing 14% of all foreign-born persons. 
The American diplomatic presence is an important element in the Bermuda 
political landscape. As a British Overseas Territory, Bermuda does not 
have a seat in the United Nations; it is represented by Britain in matters 
of foreign affairs. To promote its economic interests abroad, Bermuda maintains 
representative offices in cities such as London[57] and Washington D.C.[58] 
Bermuda's proximity to the US had made it attractive as the site for summit 
conferences between British Prime Ministers and US Presidents. The first 
summit was held in December 1953, at the insistence of Prime Minister Winston 
Churchill, to discuss relations with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. 
Participants included Churchill, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower and 
French Premier Joseph Laniel. In 1957, a second summit conference was held. 
The British Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, arrived earlier than President 
Eisenhower, to demonstrate they were meeting on British territory, as tensions 
were still high regarding the previous year's conflict over the Suez Canal. 
Macmillan returned in 1961 for the third summit with President John F. 
Kennedy. The meeting was called to discuss Cold War tensions arising from 
construction of the Berlin Wall.[59] The most recent summit conference 
in Bermuda between the two powers occurred in 1990, when British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher met US President George H.W. Bush.[59] Direct 
meetings between the President of the United States and the Premier of 
Bermuda have been rare. The most recent meeting was on 23 June 2008, between 
Premier Ewart Brown and President George W. Bush. Prior to this, the leaders 
of Bermuda and the United States had not met at the White House since a 
1996 meeting between Premier David Saul and President Bill Clinton.[60] 
Bermuda has also joined several other nations in efforts to protect the 
Sargasso Sea.[61] On 11 June 2009, four Uyghurs who had been held in the 
United States Guantánamo Bay detention camp, in Cuba, were transferred 
to Bermuda.[62][63][64][65] The four men were among 22 Uyghurs who claimed 
to be refugees, who were captured in 2001 in Pakistan after fleeing the 
American aerial bombardment of Afghanistan. They were accused of training 
to assist the Taliban's military. They were cleared as safe for release 
from Guantánamo in 2005 or 2006, but US domestic law prohibited deporting 
them back to China, their country of citizenship, because the US government 
determined that China was likely to violate their human rights. In September 
2008, the men were cleared of all suspicion and Judge Ricardo Urbina in 
Washington ordered their release. Congressional opposition to their admittance 
to the United States was very strong[62] and the US failed to find a home 
for them until Bermuda and Palau agreed to accept the 22 men in June 2009. 
The secret bilateral discussions that led to prisoner transfers between 
the US and the devolved Bermuda government sparked diplomatic ire from 
the United Kingdom, which was not consulted on the move despite Bermuda 
being a British territory. The British Foreign Office issued the following 
statement: We've underlined to the Bermuda Government that they should 
have consulted with the United Kingdom as to whether this falls within 
their competence or is a security issue, for which the Bermuda Government 
do not have delegated responsibility. We have made clear to the Bermuda 
Government the need for a security assessment, which we are now helping 
them to carry out, and we will decide on further steps as appropriate.[citation 
needed] As of May 2013, the four Uyghurs still lived in Bermuda; but they 
have not been given Bermudian status and remain stateless, posing problems 
for emergency medical situations and finding certain jobs. However, granting 
them Bermudian status would require a change in Bermudian laws, and the 
issue has prompted a major debate within Bermuda's parliament on what steps 
should be taken.[66] Homosexuality was decriminalised in Bermuda with the 
passage of the Stubbs Bill in May 1994. Legislation was introduced by Private 
Members Bill by PLP MP Wayne Furbert to amend the Human Rights Act of Bermuda 
to disallow same-sex marriage under the Act in February 2016. The OBA government 
simultaneously introduced a bill to permit civil unions. Both measures 
were in response to a decision by the Chief Justice of Bermuda's earlier 
ruling that same-sex spouses of Bermuda citizens could not be denied basic 
human rights. On June 23, the OBA Government held a "non-binding" referendum. 
The referendum posed 2 questions: 1 - Same-sex marriage (Yes or No) 2 - 
Civil unions (Yes or No). In order for the non-binding referendum to be 
valid, 50% plus 1 of registered voters had to vote. The required minimum 
was not reached. The following week, Furbert[67] tabled a bill to deny 
same-sex marriage in Bermuda.[68] On July 14th, 2016, the senate of Bermuda 
rejected the Furbert bill.[69] Bermuda became an associate member of the 
Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in 2003 despite not being in the Caribbean 
region.[70][71] This is a socio-economic bloc of nations in or near the 
Caribbean Sea. Other outlying member states include the Co-operative Republic 
of Guyana and the Republic of Suriname in South America, along with Belize 
in Central America. The Turks and Caicos Islands, an associate member of 
CARICOM, and the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, a full member of CARICOM, 
are in the Atlantic, but near to the Caribbean. Other nearby nations or 
territories, such as the United States, are not members (although the US 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has observer status, and the United States 
Virgin Islands announced in 2007 they would seek ties with CARICOM). Bermuda, 
at roughly a thousand miles from the Caribbean Sea, has little trade with, 
and little economically in common with, the region, and joined primarily 
to strengthen cultural links. Among some scholars,[who?] "the Caribbean" 
can be a socio-historical category, commonly referring to a cultural zone 
characterised by the legacy of slavery (a characteristic Bermuda shared 
with the Caribbean and the US) and the plantation system (which did not 
exist in Bermuda). It embraces the islands and parts of the neighbouring 
continent, and may be extended to include the Caribbean Diaspora overseas.[72] 
Bermuda was colonised by the English as an extension of Virginia and has 
long had close ties with the US Atlantic Seaboard and Canadian Maritimes 
as well as the UK. It had a history of African slavery, although Britain 
abolished it decades before the US. Since the 20th century, there has been 
considerable immigration to Bermuda from the West Indies, as well as continued 
immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands. Unlike immigrants from British 
colonies in the West Indies, the latter immigrants have had greater difficulty 
in becoming permanent residents as they lacked British citizenship, mostly 
spoke no English, and required renewal of work permits to remain beyond 
an initial period. From the 1950s onwards, Bermuda relaxed its immigration 
laws, allowing increased immigration from Britain and Canada. Some Black 
politicians accused the government of using this device to counter the 
West Indian immigration of previous decades. The PLP, the party in government 
when the decision to join CARICOM was made, has been dominated for decades 
by West Indians and their descendants. (The prominent roles of West Indians 
among Bermuda's black politicians and labour activists predated party politics 
in Bermuda, as exemplified by Dr. E. F. Gordon).[73][74] The late PLP leader, 
Dame Lois Browne-Evans, and her Trinidadian-born husband, John Evans (who 
co-founded the West Indian Association of Bermuda in 1976),[75] were prominent 
members of this group. They have emphasised Bermuda's cultural connections 
with the West Indies. Many Bermudians, both black and white, who lack family 
connections to the West Indies have objected to this emphasis.[75][76][77] 
Opinion polls conducted by Bermudian newspapers, The Royal Gazette and 
The Bermuda Sun, showed clear majorities of Bermudians to be opposed to 
joining CARICOM. The UBP, which had been in Government from 1968 to 1998, 
objected that joining CARICOM was detrimental to Bermuda's interests: Once 
known as "the Gibraltar of the West" and "Fortress Bermuda", Bermuda today 
is defended by forces of the British government. For the first two centuries 
of settlement, the most potent armed force operating from Bermuda was its 
merchant shipping fleet, which turned to privateering at every opportunity. 
The Bermuda government maintained a local militia. After the American Revolutionary 
War, Bermuda was established as the Western Atlantic headquarters of the 
Royal Navy. Once the Royal Navy established a base and dockyard defended 
by regular soldiers, however, the militias were disbanded following the 
War of 1812. At the end of the 19th century, the colony raised volunteer 
units to form a reserve for the military garrison. Due to its isolated 
location in the North Atlantic Ocean, Bermuda was vital to the Allies' 
war effort during both world wars of the 20th century, serving as a marshalling 
point for trans-Atlantic convoys, as well as a naval air base. By the Second 
World War, both the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm and the Royal Air Force 
were operating Seaplane bases on Bermuda. In May 1940, the US requested 
base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister 
Winston Churchill was initially unwilling to accede to the American request 
without getting something in return.[90] In September 1940, as part of 
the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, the UK granted the US base rights in 
Bermuda. Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement, 
but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. 
One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built 
would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration 
of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from Darrell's 
Island in 1943). Construction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting 
of 5.8 km2 (2.2 sq mi) of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many 
years, Bermuda's bases were used by US Air Force transport and refuelling 
aircraft and by US Navy aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, 
first German and, later, Soviet. The principal installation, Kindley Air 
Force Base on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 
and redesignated Naval Air Station Bermuda. As a naval air station, the 
base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, 
as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and Canadian Forces 
aircraft. The original NAS Bermuda on the west side of the island, a seaplane 
base until the mid-1960s, was designated as the Naval Air Station Bermuda 
Annex. It provided optional anchorage and/or dockage facilities for transiting 
US Navy, US Coast Guard and NATO vessels, depending on size. An additional 
US Navy compound known as Naval Facility Bermuda (NAVFAC Bermuda), a SOSUS 
station, was located to the west of the Annex near a Canadian Forces communications 
facility. Although leased for 99 years, US forces withdrew in 1995, as 
part of the wave of base closures following the end of the Cold War. Canada, 
which had operated a war-time naval base, HMCS Somers Isles, on the old 
Royal Navy base at Convict Bay, St George's, also established a radio-listening 
post at Daniel's Head in the West End of the islands during this time. 
In the 1950s, after the end of World War II, the Royal Naval dockyard and 
the military garrison were closed. A small Royal Navy supply base, HMS 
Malabar, continued to operate within the dockyard area, supporting transiting 
Royal Navy ships and submarines until it, too, was closed in 1995, along 
with the American and Canadian bases. Bermudians served in the British 
armed forces during both World War I and World War II. After the latter, 
Major-General Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert, Bermuda's highest-ranking soldier, 
was instrumental in developing the Bermuda Regiment. A number of other 
Bermudians and their descendants had preceded him into senior ranks, including 
Bahamian-born Admiral Lord Gambier, and Bermudian-born Royal Marines Brigadier 
Harvey. When promoted to Brigadier at age 39, following his wounding at 
the Anzio landings, Harvey became the youngest-ever Royal Marine Brigadier. 
The Cenotaph in front of the Cabinet Building (in Hamilton) was erected 
in tribute to Bermuda's Great War dead (the tribute was later extended 
to Bermuda's Second World War dead) and is the site of the annual Remembrance 
Day commemoration. Today, the only military unit remaining in Bermuda, 
other than naval and army cadet corps, is the Bermuda Regiment, an amalgam 
of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century. 
Although the Regiment's predecessors were voluntary units, the modern body 
is formed primarily by conscription: balloted males are required to serve 
for three years, two months part-time, once they turn 18. In 1970 the country 
switched its currency from the Bermudian pound to the Bermudian dollar, 
which is pegged at par with the US dollar. US notes and coins are used 
interchangeably with Bermudian notes and coins within the islands for most 
practical purposes; however, banks levy an exchange rate fee for the purchase 
of US dollars with Bermudian dollars.[91] Bermudian notes carry the image 
of Queen Elizabeth II. The Bermuda Monetary Authority is the issuing authority 
for all banknotes and coins, and regulates financial institutions. The 
Royal Naval Dockyard Museum holds a permanent exhibition of Bermuda notes 
and coins. According to the Bermuda Government's Economic Statistics Division, 
Bermuda's GDP was $5.85 billion in 2007, or $91,477 per capita, giving 
Bermuda the highest GDP per capita in the world.[5] The affordability of 
housing became a prominent issue during Bermuda's business peak in 2005 
but has softened with the decline of Bermuda's real estate prices. The 
CIA World Factbook lists the average cost of a house in June 2003 as $976,000,[92] 
while real estate agencies have claimed that this figure had risen to between 
$1.6 million[93] and $1.845 million by 2007,[94] though such high figures 
have been disputed.[95] Bermuda is an offshore financial centre, which 
results from its minimal standards of business regulation/laws and direct 
taxation on personal or corporate income. It has one of the highest consumption 
taxes in the world and taxes all imports in lieu of an income tax system. 
Bermudas's consumption tax is equivalent to local income tax to local residents 
and funds government and infrastructure expenditures. The local tax system 
depends upon import duties, payroll taxes and consumption taxes. The legal 
system is derived from that of the United Kingdom, with recourse to English 
courts of final appeal. Foreign private individuals cannot easily open 
bank accounts or subscribe to mobile phone or internet services.[96] Having 
no corporate income tax, Bermuda is a popular tax avoidance location. Google, 
for example, is known to have shifted over $10 billion in revenue to its 
Bermuda subsidiary utilising the "Double Irish" and "Dutch Sandwich" tax 
avoidance strategies, reducing its 2011 tax liability by $2 billion.[97] 
Government employment, off-shore business, and tourism are the largest 
sectors of Bermuda's economy.[7] However, in September 2009, the Irish 
press reported that a growing number of companies were moving from Bermuda 
to Ireland as part of a search for "a more stable environment".[98] Large 
numbers of leading international insurance companies operate in Bermuda.[99] 
Those internationally owned and operated businesses that are physically 
based in Bermuda (around four hundred) are represented by the Association 
of Bermuda International Companies (ABIC). In total, over 15,000 exempted 
or international companies are currently registered with the Registrar 
of Companies in Bermuda, most of which hold no office space or employees. 
There are four hundred securities listed on the stock exchange, of which 
almost three hundred are offshore funds and alternative investment structures 
attracted by Bermuda's regulatory environment. The Exchange specialises 
in listing and trading of capital market instruments such as equities, 
debt issues, funds (including hedge fund structures) and depository receipt 
programmes. The BSX is a full member of the World Federation of Exchanges 
and is located in an OECD member nation. It also has Approved Stock Exchange 
status under Australia's Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) taxation rules and 
Designated Investment Exchange status by the UK's Financial Services Authority. 
Four banks operate in Bermuda,[100] having consolidated total assets of 
$24.3 billion (March 2014).[101] Tourism is Bermuda's second-largest industry, 
with the island attracting over half a million visitors annually, of whom 
more than 80% are from the United States. Other significant sources of 
visitors are from Canada and the United Kingdom. Tourists arrive either 
by cruise ship or by air at L.F. Wade International Airport, the only airport 
on the island.[102] The Bermuda Education Act 1996 requires that only three 
categories of schools can operate in the Bermuda Education system: Warwick 
Academy, one of the oldest schools in the western hemisphere, is in the 
parish of Warwick, Bermuda. Prior to 1965, the Bermuda school system was 
racially segregated. When the desegregation of schools was enacted in 1965, 
two of the formally maintained "white" schools and both single-sex schools 
opted to become private schools. The rest became part of the public school 
system and were either aided or maintained. At present there are 26 schools 
in the Bermuda Public School System, 18 of which are primary schools, five 
are middle schools, two senior schools (The Berkeley Institute and Cedarbridge 
Academy) and one special school. An Alternative Programme is provided for 
students with behavioural challenges who cannot function in the public 
mainstream. There is one aided primary school, two aided middle schools, 
and one aided senior school. For higher education, the Bermuda College 
offers various associate degrees and other certificate programmes.[103] 
Bermuda does not have any four-year colleges or universities. Bermuda's 
graduates attend four year Universities in the United States, Canada, or 
England. In May 2009, Bermudian Government's application was approved to 
become a contributory member of the University of the West Indies (UWI). 
Bermuda's membership enabled Bermudian students to enter the University 
at an agreed upon subsidised rate by 2010. UWI also agreed that their Open 
Campus (online degree courses) would become open to Bermudian students 
in the future, with Bermuda becoming the 13th country to have access to 
the Open Campus.[104][105] The Bermuda Hospitals Board operates the King 
Edward VII Memorial Hospital, located in Paget Parish, and the Mid-Atlantic 
Wellness Institute, located in Devonshire Parish.[106] Unlike other countries 
that are a part of the British Colonies, Bermuda does not have national 
healthcare. Employees must provide a healthcare plan and pay 50% of the 
cost. Having healthcare is mandatory and even with help from employers 
very expensive. There are only a few approved health care providers that 
offer insurance to Bermudians.[107] They are listed below: Many sports 
popular today were formalised by British Public schools and universities 
in the 19th century. These schools produced the civil servants and military 
and naval officers required to build and maintain the British empire, and 
team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to 
think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to 
pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as the Football 
Association (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes 
began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players. 
The professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. Bermuda's 
role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an 
army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military officers quickly 
introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including cricket, football, 
Rugby football, and even tennis and rowing (rowing did not adapt well from 
British rivers to the stormy Atlantic. The officers soon switched to sail 
racing, founding the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club). Once these sports reached 
Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians. Bermuda's national cricket 
team participated in the Cricket World Cup 2007 in the West Indies. Their 
most famous player is a 130 kilograms (290 lb) police officer named Dwayne

rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the 
occasion for a popular national holiday. This tournament began in 1872 
when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda, 
holding a match at Somerset to mark forty years since the unjust thraldom 
of slavery. The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations 
of the St. George's Garrison (the original army headquarters in Bermuda) 
on Barrack Hill, St. George's, and the Royal Naval Dockyard at Ireland 
Island. Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George's 
Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs has long been mostly 
civilian).[108] In 2007, Bermuda hosted the 25th PGA Grand Slam of Golf. 
This 36-hole event was held on 16–17 October 2007, at the Mid Ocean Club 
in Tucker's Town. This season-ending tournament is limited to four golfers: 
the winners of the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA Championship. 
The event returned to Bermuda in 2008 and 2009. Bermudian Quinn Talbot 
was once the World one-armed golf champion. The Government announced in 
2006 that it would provide substantial financial support to Bermuda's cricket

Wells. In 2006, the Bermuda Hogges were formed as the nation's first professional 
football team to raise the standard of play for the Bermuda national football 
team. The team played in the United Soccer Leagues Second Division but 
folded in 2013. Sailing, fishing and equestrian sports are popular with 
both residents and visitors alike. The prestigious Newport–Bermuda Yacht 
Race is a more than 100-year-old tradition, with boats racing between Newport, 
Rhode Island and Bermuda. In 2007, the 16th biennial Marion-Bermuda yacht 
race occurred. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the Bermuda Fitted Dinghy. 
International One Design racing also originated in Bermuda.[109] In December 
2013, Bermuda's bid to host the 2017 America's Cup was announced. At the

the Yankee training camp to Bermuda permanently.[110][111] In 1998, Bermuda 
established its own Basketball Association.[112] Since then, its national
