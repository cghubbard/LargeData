Clifford Rankin "Pat" Crawford, a.k.a. "Captain Pat", (January 28, 1902 
â€“ January 25, 1994) was a major league baseball player. Crawford went to 
Davidson College. He played baseball for several semi-pro and minor league 
teams throughout the 1920s including a stint as the left fielder for the 
1922 Kinston Highwaymen in the Eastern Carolina Baseball Association, an 
independent or "outlaw league" team not affiliated with the National Association. 
Crawford got his big break in 1929 when he made it to the majors with the 
New York Giants, which were still being managed by the Hall of Famer John 
McGraw. On May 26, 1929, Crawford hit a pinch hit grand slam off Socks 
Seibold in the sixth inning. Les Bell then hit a seventh inning pinch hit 
grand slam off Carl Hubbell. This was the only time in history that two 
pinch hit grand slams were hit in the same game. In 1931 and 1932, he had 
over 237 and 236 hits respectively for minor league Columbus, Ohio.[1] 
He went in and out of the majors through the 1934 season and was named 
league MVP of the American Association while playing for the Columbus Senators 
in 1932. In 1934, Crawford found himself playing on the world champion 
St. Louis Cardinals. The last two games of his major league career were 
World Series games. His teammates on the Gashouse Gang that year included 
HOFers Frankie Frisch, Leo Durocher, Joe Medwick, Dizzy Dean, and Burleigh 
Grimes. All told, Pat had a .280 batting average in 318 major league games. 
He was one of the initial inductees in the Kinston Professional Baseball
