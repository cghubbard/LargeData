Below are the players and rosters of the minor league affiliates of the 
Baltimore Orioles: Michael Gabriel Almanzar Campo (born December 2, 1990) 
is a Dominican professional baseball corner infielder who is currently 
a free agent. Almanzar signed as an amateur free agent with the Boston 
Red Sox at the age of 16, receiving a $1.5 million signing bonus, the largest 
the Red Sox had given to an amateur international free agent at the time.[1] 
Almanzar struggled in his early years in the system but showed improvement 
with the Salem and Portland clubs in 2012 and 2013. He was selected by 
the Baltimore Orioles in the 2013 Rule 5 draft and was in spring training 
with the Orioles, where he was considered a contender to begin the 2014 
season at third base replacing the injured Manny Machado. He then was diagnosed 
with tendinitis in his knee and placed on the 60-day disabled list at the 
end of March, beginning a rehabilitation stint on June 20 while appearing 
in nine games across three levels. Because Baltimore was unable to keep 
Almanzar on its 25-man roster, it was required to offer him back to Boston.[2] 
The Orioles acquired Almanzar and Kelly Johnson from the Red Sox for Jemile 
Weeks and Iván DeJesús, Jr. on August 30.[3] His father, Carlos Almanzar, 
pitched in the majors for five different teams in parts of eight seasons 
spanning 1997–2005.[4] Drew Tyler Dosch (born June 24, 1992) is an American

with 11 home runs and 83 runs batted in (RBI). In his final collegiate 
game, he tore his ACL.[5] Despite the injury, Dosch was drafted by the 
Baltimore Orioles in the seventh round of the 2013 Major League Baseball 
draft.[6] After spending 2013 rehabbing the injury, he made his professional 
debut in 2014 with the Delmarva Shorebirds.[7] He finished the season with 
a Delmarva record 157 hits.[8] Dosch started 2015 with the Frederick Keys.[9][10]
