George Martin Weiss (June 23, 1894 – August 13, 1972) was an American baseball 
executive. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971. Weiss was 
one of Major League Baseball's most successful farm system directors and 
general managers. Working as the head of the New York Yankees' player-development 
system from 1932 to 1947, he established it as one of the two best in the 
game, helping the Bombers win nine American League pennants and eight World 
Series championships over 16 full years. Then, during Weiss' 13-season 
tenure as the Yankees' general manager from October 1947 to 1960, the team 
won 10 AL pennants and seven more World Series titles. Weiss later became 
the first club president of the New York Mets from 1961 to 1966 after that 
expansion franchise was formed. Weiss was born in New Haven, Connecticut, 
and attended Yale University. In 1915, he founded the New Haven MaxFeds 
in the independent Colonial League, an "outlaw" minor league associated 
with the Federal League. In 1919, Weiss borrowed $5,000 to acquire the 
New Haven franchise in the established Class A Eastern League,[1] which 
was immediately nicknamed the Weissmen by local baseball writers.[2] He 
operated the New Haven club, eventually nicknamed the Profs in homage to 
Yale, for a decade. In 1930, Weiss took over the Baltimore Orioles of the 
Class AA International League for two seasons. In 1932, at 37, he was hired 
by the Yankees to create a farm system, which had been pioneered in the 
National League by the St. Louis Cardinals and was the linchpin of the 
Cardinals' dominance of the senior circuit. Weiss grew the Yankee system 
from four farm teams in 1931 to 16 by 1939 and 20 by 1947. The Yankee farm 
system churned out many of the players who would lead the Bronx Bombers 
to their four consecutive (1936–39) World Series titles in the 1930s, their 
five straight titles (1949–53), and their six other championship clubs 
sprinkled throughout the rest of the 1940s and 1950s. In October 1947, 
just after the 1947 World Series championship, Weiss was promoted to vice 
president and general manager of the Yankees, after the team's newly reconstituted 
ownership tandem of Dan Topping and Del Webb bought out original partner 
Larry MacPhail, who had also been general manager. For all intents and 
purposes, Weiss was operating head of the franchise; Topping and Webb largely 
left day-to-day operations in Weiss' hands. Weiss led the Yankees to 10 
AL pennants and seven world titles in 13 seasons. After the Yankees were 
defeated in the 1960 World Series by the Pittsburgh Pirates, Weiss and 
his longtime manager, Casey Stengel, were forced to retire. According to 
the book Yogi Berra: Eternal Yankee, Weiss at a cocktail party stated loudly 
that "he would never allow a black man to wear a Yankee uniform." The Yankees 
farm-system, which Weiss oversaw, had in place a policy preventing black 
players from reaching the major league club, according to the book. Elston 
Howard, eventually the first black Yankee, was switched from an outfielder 
to a catcher, the position at which it would be least likely to break into 
the major league club, given Yogi Berra's presence.[3] Weiss and Stengel 
both ended up with the Mets. Weiss was named president and de facto general 
manager of the Mets in May 1961, and Stengel followed as manager in 1962. 
In Weiss' five seasons as Mets general manager, the team escaped last place 
in the NL only in Weiss' last year. He was succeeded by former Cardinal 
GM Bing Devine. He was named The Sporting News' Executive of the Year in 
1950, 1951, 1952, and 1960. Weiss passed on drafting Reggie Jackson in 
the 1966 Major League Baseball Draft, instead selecting Steve Chilcott.[4] 
In 1971, Weiss was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971. Weiss 
was one of seven selected for induction. All of the inductees had been 
selected by the Veterans Committee; no players were elected through the 
regular voting process of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.[5] 
Weiss died in Greenwich, Connecticut, at age 77 in 1972. Stengel lamented 
his death, saying, "George's death is a tough thing on baseball. He was 
successful and great and capable in every way, shape and form. He wasn't 
a terrific mixer but George sure knew how to pick men. Why, you can't stay 
in baseball that long by pulling players out of an icebox."[6] Yogi Berra 
said that Weiss could be difficult to deal with, but he praised the emotion 
that Weiss brought to the game as well as his understanding of the importance 
of scouting.[6] He was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in
