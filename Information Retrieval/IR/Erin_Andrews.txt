Erin Jill Andrews[1] (born May 4, 1978) is an American sportscaster and 
television personality. She currently hosts Dancing with the Stars for 
ABC and currently a Sideline Reporter for Fox NFL.[2][3] Andrews was previously 
a co-host of College GameDay on ESPN and a contributor for Good Morning 
America on the ABC network.[4][5] She also has an on-air presence at many 
major sporting events, including the Super Bowl and the World Series. Andrews 
was born in Lewiston, Maine, to Paula Andrews, a teacher, and Steven Andrews, 
a TV journalist.[6][7] Her family moved to San Antonio, Texas when she 
was 5 years old, and then to Tampa, Florida, 18 months later,[8] when her 
father, a six-time Emmy Award–winner, began working as an investigative 
reporter for NBC affiliate WFLA-TV.[9] Andrews describes herself as a tomboy 
as a youth, living a life that always revolved around sports, watching 
NBA games with her father growing up, particularly Boston Celtics games.[8] 
Andrews cited Hannah Storm, Melissa Stark, Lesley Visser, and Suzy Kolber 
as female sportscasters she looked up to who ultimately inspired her to 
become a sportscaster herself.[8] Andrews attended Bloomingdale High School 
in Valrico, Florida, where she was a member of the dance team, student 
government, and the National Honor Society.[7] Also while growing up, she 
attended Brandon School of Dance Arts in Seffner, Florida. In high school, 
Andrews claimed that, as a tomboy, she did not have a lot of female friends, 
opting to hang out with the boys, finding it more enjoyable to discuss 
sports with them.[8] Following graduation from high school in 1996, Andrews 
attended the University of Florida, graduating in 2000 with a Bachelor 
of Arts (BA) degree in Telecommunications.[4] While in college, she was 
a member of the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority,[10] and the Florida Gators Dazzlers 
dance team from 1997 to 2000.[4] She has a younger sister, Kendra Andrews, 
who is a professional dancer and actress.[11] In 2000, Andrews was employed 
by Fox Sports Florida as a freelance reporter. From 2001 to 2002, she served 
as a Tampa Bay Lightning reporter for the Sunshine Network. From 2002 to 
2004, Andrews covered the Atlanta Braves, Atlanta Thrashers, and Atlanta 
Hawks for the Turner South network as a studio host and reporter.[4] Andrews 
began working for ESPN in April 2004 as a reporter for ESPN National Hockey 
Night. She has also reported for the College World Series, Little League 
World Series, and Great Outdoor Games. Andrews began serving as a sideline 
reporter for ESPN College Football Saturday Primetime and Big Ten college 
basketball games, and in 2005, her job expanded to include ESPN College 
Football Thursday Primetime and Major League Baseball sideline reporting. 
From 2008 to 2010, she reported for ESPN’s and ABC’s live coverage of the 
Scripps National Spelling Bee.[4] Andrews has been a guest on several talk 
shows, including The Oprah Winfrey Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and The Tonight 
Show with Jay Leno.[citation needed] In 2010, Andrews appeared on the tenth 
season of ABC's Dancing with the Stars, partnered with Maksim Chmerkovskiy. 
They placed third out of 11 couples.[12] On January 13, 2011, it was announced 
that Andrews signed an endorsement deal with Reebok to promote its ZigTech 
brand.[13] Two weeks prior, as a sideline reporter during the 2011 Rose 
Bowl, Andrews noted that Texas Christian University Horned Frogs football 
players were slipping on the turf because of the new Nike shoes they were 
wearing. Due to the conflict of interest, ESPN announced revised endorsement 
guidelines for its journalists that required Andrews to end her endorsement 
deal with Reebok by the end of 2011.[14] In November, 2011, former ESPN 
executive Keith Clinkscales filed suit against an erstwhile colleague named 
Joan Lynch, claiming that Lynch had falsely alleged that Clinkscales had 
masturbated while sitting next to Andrews on an airplane flight earlier 
that year.[15] Andrews was reported to have disclosed the incident to a 
number of people, but chose not to pursue the matter with ESPN's HR department 
because she was still shaken by public disclosure of her stalking experiences.[15][16] 
Andrews hosted the first hour of ESPN's College GameDay on ESPNU, and had 
been a Good Morning America correspondent on ABC since 2010, though she 
had not appeared on the show since covering the Oscars in February 2011.[5] 
On June 29, 2012, it was announced that Andrews was leaving ESPN to join 
Fox Sports. She was the first host of Fox College Football's studio show 
with Eddie George and Joey Harrington joining her as analysts. Andrews 
is also a contributor on Fox NFL Sunday and serves as a field reporter 
for most major sporting events aired on Fox, such as the MLB All-Star Game, 
the World Series, the NFL Playoffs, and Daytona 500.[17] With the launch 
of Fox Sports 1 on August 17, 2013, Andrews took on several new exciting 
and challenging roles. She became the guest host of Fox College Football 
Kickoff and Fox College Saturday, a direct competitor to ESPN College Gameday, 
which previews the weekend's biggest college football games. Andrews would 
also contribute to daily studio show Fox Football Daily. Andrews's performance 
has been widely criticized since she joined Fox Sports' MLB coverage in 
2012. For example,[18] Andrews during postseason trophy presentations, 
has been accused of showing an extreme lack of knowledge by reading off 
post-it notes. During the trophy presentation at the end of the 2013 American 
League Championship Series, Andrews misidentified former Anaheim Angels 
owner and honorary American League president Jackie Autry as her late husband 
Gene. On February 23, 2014, it was announced that Andrews would replace 
Brooke Burke-Charvet as the co-host of Dancing with the Stars beginning 
with its 18th season in March 2014.[19] On July 14, 2014, it was announced 
that Andrews would be replacing Pam Oliver as the sideline reporter on 
Fox's lead NFL broadcasting crew.[20] Andrews became a spokesperson for 
the Kraft Foods Huddle to Fight Hunger campaign in 2010, which aimed to 
raise US$2.86 million for Feeding America.[21] In October 2011, Erin Andrews 
teamed up with StubHub, the world’s largest online ticket marketplace, 
to launch a new national campaign called Girls Night Out. This campaign 
encourages women to celebrate and take pride in their love for sports with 
the opportunity of winning tickets to attend a game of their choice with 
their friends. A portion of the ticket sales from specific events will 
be donated to the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors. In a quote 
given by Andrews to Entertainment Business Weekly, she describes her affiliation 
with Girls Night Out as "a great way for women to show their team spirit 
this fall, I chose to work with StubHub on this because I know firsthand 
that many women are just as fanatical about going to games as men, and 
what better way to showcase that than being at a stadium with your friends 
and supporting such a great cause too." [22] In May 2013, she co-hosted 
the Music Builds: CMT Disaster Relief Concert on the CMT network to raise 
money for the American Red Cross in response to the April 27 tornadoes 
in Oklahoma.[23] At the beginning of the National Football League season, 
Andrews was named the new face of Covergirl and partnered with the cosmetic 
company for the new #Gameface contest, which encourages women to upload 
their spirited, fan game faced images, to social media platforms such as 
Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook with the hashtag “#Gameface” and tagging 
@Covergirl. There would be winners each week which would be picked by Andrews 
and the winner would be entered to win a pair of tickets to the 2015 Super 
Bowl. Andrews discussed her involvement with Covergirl and the reason why 
she teamed up with the cosmetic company: "Female fans just aren't paid 
attention to, but there are so many female football and sports fans that 
are into looking pretty. It's about time a beauty brand got it." [24] In 
2008, Michael David Barrett, then 46, filmed Andrews in her hotel room 
through peepholes at the Nashville Marriott adjacent to Vanderbilt University 
in Nashville, Tennessee, and the Radisson Airport Hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
On July 16, 2009, one of these videos, in which Andrews appeared totally 
nude, was posted online and quickly went viral.[25] Barrett was arrested 
on October 2, 2009, by the FBI for interstate stalking, and pleaded guilty 
to the charges on December 15, 2009. A second tape of Andrews was discovered 
on Barrett's computer by authorities in which she is nude in her room at 
the Radisson Airport Hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This tape was never 
made public.[26][27] On March 15, 2010, Barrett was sentenced to 2 years 
and 6 months in prison, three years of probation, US$5,000 in fines, and 
US$7,366 in restitution.[28] He served his sentence at the Seattle Community 
Corrections and was released on July 3, 2012.[29] Andrews sued Barrett, 
Marriott International, Radisson Hotels, and five other entities for negligence 
and invasion of privacy in connection with the secret videotaping.[25] 
In her lawsuit against Marriott, Andrews alleged that hotel employees gave 
Barrett the dates she would be at a hotel and a room next to hers.[30] 
In 2011, Andrews worked with U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar to enact a new 
federal anti-stalking law.[31] Andrews was still trying to get the video 
removed from the Internet in July 2011.[32] In March 2013, Andrews' lawyers 
filed a motion in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking to quash a subpoena 
from Marriott "seeking her payroll records, contracts, performance reviews, 
any disciplinary reports, as well as other employment information from 
her current employer, Fox."[30] The attorneys said that Marriott is also 
seeking "physician letters, notes, annual physicals, and other related 
medical records" and that the request was an attempt to "harass and embarrass" 
Andrews.[30] In October 2015, Andrews filed a complaint against the Nashville 
Marriott and Michael David Barrett for US$75 million.[33] Jury selection 
for the hearing began on February 22, 2016.[34] On March 7, 2016, after 
a two-week trial, the jury awarded Erin Andrews US$55 million in her civil 
lawsuit over the secret recording and release of a video showing her naked 
during a hotel stay.[35] Andrews previously lived in Atlanta, Georgia, 
but now lives in Los Angeles, California.[36] She was voted "America's 
sexiest sportscaster" in 2007 and 2008 by Playboy magazine.[37] She is 
in a relationship with professional hockey player Jarret Stoll, which began
