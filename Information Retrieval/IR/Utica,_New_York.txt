 New York Utica (pronounced i/ˈjuːtᵻkə/) is a city in the Mohawk Valley 
and the county seat of Oneida County, New York, United States. The tenth-most-populous 
city in New York, its population was 62,235 in the 2010 U.S. census. Located 
on the Mohawk River at the foot of the Adirondack Mountains, Utica is approximately 
90 miles (145 km) northwest of Albany and 45 miles (72 km) east of Syracuse. 
Although Utica and the neighboring city of Rome have their own metropolitan 
area, both cities are also represented and influenced by the commercial, 
educational and cultural characteristics of the Capital District and Syracuse 
metropolitan areas. Formerly a river settlement inhabited by the Mohawk 
tribe of the Iroquois Confederacy, Utica attracted European-American settlers 
from New England during and after the American Revolution. In the 19th century, 
immigrants strengthened its position as a layover city between Albany and 
Syracuse on the Erie and Chenango Canals and the New York Central Railroad. 
During the 19th and 20th centuries, the city's infrastructure contributed 
to its success as a manufacturing center and defined its role as a worldwide 
hub for the textile industry. Utica's 20th-century political corruption 
and organized crime gave it the nicknames "Sin City",[11] and later, "the 
city that God forgot."[12] Like other Rust Belt cities, Utica had an economic 
downturn beginning in the mid-20th century. The downturn consisted of industrial 
decline due to globalization and the closure of textile mills, population 
loss caused by the relocation of jobs and businesses to suburbs and to 
Syracuse, and poverty associated with socioeconomic stress and a decreased 
tax base. With its low cost of living, the city has become a melting pot 
for refugees from war-torn countries around the world, encouraging growth 
for its colleges and universities, cultural institutions and economy. Several 
theories exist about the history of the name "Utica".[13] Although surveyor 
Robert Harpur stated that he named the village,[13] the most accepted theory 
involves a 1798 meeting at Bagg's Tavern (a resting place for travelers 
passing through the village) where the name was picked from a hat holding 
13 suggestions,[13][14] Utica being included because it is the name of 
a city of antiquity (several other upstate New York cities had adopted 
classical Mediterranean city names earlier, such as Troy, New York (1789) 
and Rome, New York (1796), or were to later, as with Syracuse, New York 
(1847)).[15] Utica was established on the site of Old Fort Schuyler, built 
by English colonists for defense in 1758 during the French and Indian War, 
the North American front of the Seven Years' War against France.[4][16][17][18] 
Prior to construction of the fort, the Mohawk, Onondaga and Oneida tribes 
had occupied this area south of the Great Lakes region as early as 4000 
BC.[19] The Mohawk were the largest and most powerful tribe in the eastern 
part of the Mohawk Valley. Colonists had a longstanding fur trade with 
them, in exchange for firearms and rum. The tribe's dominating presence 
in the region prevented the Province of New York from expanding past the 
middle of the Mohawk Valley until after the American Revolutionary War, 
when the Iroquois were forced to cede their lands as allies of the defeated 
British.[19] The land housing Old Fort Schuyler was part of a 20,000-acre 
(80.94 km²) portion of marshland granted by King George II to New York 
governor William Cosby on January 2, 1734.[20] Since the fort was located 
near several trails (including the Great Indian Warpath), its position—on 
a bend at a shallow portion of the Mohawk River—made it an important fording 
point. The Mohawk called the bend Unundadages ("around the hill"), and 
the Mohawk word appears on the city's seal.[14][21][22] During the American 
Revolution, border raids from British-allied Iroquois tribes harried the 
settlers on the frontier. George Washington ordered Sullivan's Expedition, 
Rangers, to enter Central New York and suppress the Iroquois threat. More 
than 40 Iroquois villages were destroyed and their winter stores, causing 
starvation.[14] In the aftermath of the war, numerous European-American 
settlers migrated into the state and this western region from New England,[23] 
especially Connecticut.[14] In 1794 a state road, Genesee Road, was built 
from Utica west to the Genesee River. That year a contract was awarded 
to the Mohawk Turnpike and Bridge Company to extend the road northeast 
to Albany, and in 1798 it was extended.[4][24] The Seneca Turnpike was 
key to Utica's development, replacing a worn footpath with a paved road.[25] 
The village became a rest and supply area along the Mohawk River for goods 
and the many people moving through Western New York to and from the Great 
Lakes.[26][27] The boundaries of the village of Utica were defined in an 
act passed by the New York State Legislature on April 3, 1798.[28] Utica 
expanded its borders in subsequent 1805 and 1817 charters. On April 5, 
1805, the village's eastern and western boundaries were expanded,[29] and 
on April 7, 1817, Utica separated from Whitestown on its west.[4][30] After 
completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, the city's growth was stimulated 
again. The municipal charter was passed by the state legislature on February 13, 
1832.[4][5] The city's growth during the 19th century is indicated by the 
increase in its population; in 1845 the United States Census ranked Utica 
as the 29th-largest in the country (with 20,000 residents), more than the 
populations of Chicago, Detroit and Cleveland, respectively.[31][32] In 
the latter part of the century, Chicago became a boomtown based on resource 
extraction and processing from the Midwest, and as a railroad center. Utica's 
location on the Erie and Chenango canals encouraged industrial development, 
allowing the transport of anthracite from northeastern Pennsylvania for 
local manufacturing and distribution.[33] Utica's economy centered around 
the manufacture of furniture, heavy machinery, textiles and lumber.[34] 
The combined effects of the Embargo Act of 1807 and local investment enabled 
further expansion of the textile industry.[35] Like other upstate New York 
cities, mills in Utica processed cotton from the Deep South, a slave society. 
Much of the New York economy was closely involved with slavery; in the 
antebellum period, half of New York's exports were related to cotton. In 
addition to the canals, transport in Utica was bolstered by railroads running 
through the city. The first was the Mohawk and Hudson Rail Road, which 
became the Utica and Schenectady Railroad in 1833. Its 78-mile (126 km) 
connection between Schenectady and Utica was developed in 1836 from the 
right-of-way previously used by the Mohawk and Hudson River railway.[36][37] 
Later lines, such as the Syracuse and Utica Railroad, merged with the Utica 
and Schenectady to form the New York Central Railroad, which originated 
as a 20th-century forest railway in the Adirondacks.[38] During the 1850s, 
Utica was known to aid more than 650 fugitive slaves; it played a major 
role as a station in the Underground Railroad. The city was on a slave 
escape route from the Southern Tier to Canada by way of Albany, Syracuse 
and Rochester.[39][40] The route, used by Harriet Tubman to travel to Buffalo,[41] 
guided slaves to pass through Utica on the New York Central Railroad right-of-way 
en route to Canada.[41] Utica was the locus for Methodist preacher Orange 
Scott's antislavery sermons during the 1830s and 1840s, and Scott formed 
an abolitionist group there in 1843.[40] Despite efforts by local abolitionists, 
pro-slavery riots and mobs, who wanted to protect the cotton mills, forced 
many abolitionist meetings to other cities.[42] The early 20th century 
brought rail advances to Utica, with the New York Central electrifying 
49 miles (79 km) of track from the city to Syracuse in 1907 for its West 
Shore interurban line.[43] In 1902, the Utica and Mohawk Valley Railway 
connected Rome to Little Falls with a 37.5-mile (60.4 km) electrified line 
through Utica.[44] By the 1950s, Utica was known as "Sin City" because 
of the extent of its corruption at the hands of the Democratic Party political 
machine.[45][46][47][48] During the late 1920s, trucker Rufus Elefante 
rose to power[49][50] although he never ran for office.[51] Originally 
a Republican, Elefante's power was enhanced by support from New York governor 
Franklin D. Roosevelt.[52] Waves of Italian, Irish, Polish and Lebanese 
Maronite immigrants worked in the city's industries in the early part of 
the 20th century. Until the 1980s, organized crime had a strong role in 
the city.[48][53] Strongly affected by the deindustrialization that took 
place in other Rust Belt cities, Utica suffered a major reduction in manufacturing 
activity during the second half of the 20th century. The 1954 opening of 
the New York State Thruway (which bypassed the city) and declines in activity 
on the Erie Canal and railroads throughout the United States also contributed 
to a poor local economy.[54] During the 1980s and 1990s, major employers 
such as General Electric and Lockheed Martin began to close plants in Utica 
and Syracuse.[55][56] With city jobs moved to the towns and villages around 
Utica during the suburbanization of the postwar period. This led to the 
expansion of the nearby Town of New Hartford and the village of Whitesboro. 
Utica's lack of quality academic and educational choices, when compared 
to Syracuse under an hour away, contributed to its decline in local businesses 
and jobs as some economic activity moved to Syracuse during the 1990s.[57] 
Utica's population fell while population in the county increased, reflecting 
a statewide trend of decreasing urban populations outside New York City.[58] 
Residents who remain in the city struggle to handle poverty issues stemming 
from social and economic conditions caused partially by a smaller tax base; 
this adversely affects schools and public services.[59][60] Despite the 
city's economic decline, it has benefited from a low cost of living,[61][62] 
attracting immigrants and refugees from around the world.[63][64][65] Among 
the new waves of immigrants are Muslim Bosnians and Buddhist Vietnamese. 
Further bolstering the city are its commercial, educational and cultural 
ties to the Capital District and Syracuse metropolitan areas.[66][67] In 
2010, Utica, the focus of local, regional and statewide economic-revitalization 
efforts,[68][69][70] developed its first comprehensive master plan in more 
than a half-century.[71][72] According to the United States Census Bureau, 
Utica has a total area of 17.02 square miles (44.1 km2)—16.76 square miles 
(43.4 km2) of land and 0.26 square miles (0.67 km2) (1.52 percent) of water.[73] 
The city is located at New York's geographic center, adjacent to the western 
border of Herkimer County, New York, and at the southwestern base of the 
Adirondack Mountains.[74] Utica and its suburbs are bound by the Allegheny 
Plateau in the south and the Adirondack Mountains in the north,[75] and 
the city is 456 feet (139 m) above sea level. The city is 90 miles (145 km) 
northwest of Albany[76] and 45 miles (72 km) east of Syracuse.[77] The 
city's Mohawk name, Unundadages ("around the hill") refers to a bend in 
the Mohawk River that flows around the city's elevated position as seen 
from the Deerfield Hills in the north.[21] The Erie Canal and Mohawk River 
pass through northern Utica; northwest of downtown is the Utica Marsh, 
a group of cattail wetlands between the Erie Canal and Mohawk River (partially 
in the town of Marcy) with a variety of animals, plants and birds.[78][79] 
During the 1850s, plank roads were built through the marshland surrounding 
the city.[80] Utica's suburbs have more hills and cliffs than the city. 
Located where the Mohawk Valley forms a wide floodplain, the city has a 
generally sloping, flat topography.[74] Utica's architecture features many 
styles that are also visible in comparable areas of Buffalo, Rochester 
and Syracuse,[81] including Greek Revival, Italianate, French Renaissance,[82] 
Gothic Revival and Neoclassical. The modernist 1972 Utica State Office 
Building, at 17 floors and 227 feet (69 m), is the city's tallest.[83] 
Early settlers and property owners contributed to the development of the 
city, and many families and individuals are remembered in street names.[84] 
Streets laid out when Utica was a village had more irregularities than 
those built later in the 19th and 20th centuries. As a result of the city's 
location (adjacent to the Mohawk River), many streets parallel the river, 
so they do not run strictly east-west or north–south. Remnants of Utica's 
early electric-rail systems can be seen in the West and South neighborhoods, 
where the rails were set into the streets.[21][85][86] Utica's neighborhoods 
have historically been defined by their residents, allowing them to develop 
their own individuality. Racial and ethnic groups, social and economic 
separation and the development of infrastructure and new means of transportation 
have shaped neighborhoods, with groups shifting between them as a result.[32] 
West Utica (or the West Side) was historically home to German, Irish and 
Polish immigrants. The Corn Hill neighborhood in the city center had a 
significant Jewish population.[87] East Utica (or the East Side) is a cultural 
and political center dominated by Italian immigrants.[88][89] North of 
downtown is the Triangle neighborhood, home to the city's African American 
and Jewish populations. Neighborhoods formerly dominated by one or more 
groups saw other groups arrive, such as Bosnians and Latin Americans in 
former Italian neighborhoods and the Welsh in Corn Hill.[32] Bagg Commemorative 
Park and Bagg's Square West (Utica's historic centers) are in the northeastern 
portion of downtown, with Genesee Street on the west and Oriskany Street 
on the south.[82] The following are listed on the National Register of 
Historic Places:[90][91][92][93][94] Utica has a continental climate with 
four distinct seasons and is in the humid continental climate (or warm-summer 
climate: Köppen Dfb)[95][96] zone, characterized by cold winters and temperate 
summers. Summer daytime temperatures range from 70–82 °F (21-28 °C), with 
an average winter daytime temperature below -3 °C (27 °F).[96] The city 
is in USDA plant hardiness zone 5a, and native vegetation can tolerate 
temperatures from -10 °F to -20 °F (-28.9 °C to -26.1 °C).[97] Winters 
are cold and snowy; Utica receives lake-effect snow from Lake Erie and 
Lake Ontario.[98][99][100] Utica is colder on average than other Great 
Lakes cities because of its location in a valley and susceptibility to 
north winds;[101] temperatures in the single digits or below zero Fahrenheit 
are not uncommon on winter nights. Annual precipitation (based on a 30-year 
average from 1981–2010) is 42.1 inches (107 cm), falling on an average 
of 171 days.[102] Although Utica's population is predominantly European 
American, it has diversified since the 1990s. New immigrants and refugees 
have included Bosnians (displaced by the Bosnian War), Russians, Burmese, 
Vietnamese, and Latinos.[108] More than 15 languages are spoken in the 
city.[109] Utica has a low cost of living but its industrial and economic 
decline have posed difficulties for people trying to make a new start.[110] 
The city is the tenth most populous in New York,[111] the seat of Oneida 
County,[112] and (with Schenectady) a focal point of the six-county Mohawk 
Valley region. According to a U.S. Census estimate, the Utica–Rome Metropolitan 
Statistical Area decreased in population from 299,397 in 2010 to 296,615 
on July 1, 2014[111] and its population density was about 3,818 people 
per square mile (1,474/km²). Counties in the Mohawk Valley have a combined 
population of 622,133.[c] In the 2010 United States Census, Utica's population 
was 62,235. Sixty-nine percent of the population was European American 
(of which 64.5 percent was non-Hispanic white), 15.3 percent was African 
American, and 0.3 percent was American Indian or Alaska Native. Asians 
were 7.2 percent of the city's population (3.5 percent Burmese, 1.5 percent 
Vietnamese, 0.7 percent Cambodian, 0.4 percent Indian, 0.2 percent Chinese, 
and 0.7 percent other Asian; numbers do not add up to 7.2 percent due to 
rounding),[113] Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders were 0.1 percent, 
and Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 10.5 percent (6.8 percent Puerto 
Rican, 1.5 percent Dominican, 0.4 percent Mexican, 0.3 percent Salvadoran, 
0.2 percent Ecuadoran, 0.1 percent Cuban and 1.2 percent other Hispanic 
or Latino). Other races were 3.9 percent, and multiracial individuals made 
up four percent of the population.[114] Median income for a Utica household 
was $30,818. Per capita income was $17,653, and 29.6 percent of the population 
were below the poverty threshold.[73] During the mid-19th century, Utica's 
canals and railroads supported industries producing furniture, locomotive 
headlights, steam gauges, firearms, textiles and lumber.[34][82] World 
War I sparked the growth of Savage Arms, which produced the Lewis gun for 
the British Army,[116] and the city prospered as one of the wealthiest 
per capita in the United States.[117] In the early 20th century, the local 
textile industry began to decline, which had a significant impact on the 
local economy. The boll weevil adversely affected southern cotton crops 
in this period. During the late 1940s, air-conditioned mills opened in 
the southern United States, and jobs were lost as factories were moved 
south, where labor costs were lower because "right to work" laws weakened 
unions. Other industries also moved out of the city during a general restructuring 
in older industrial cities.[118] New industries to rise in the city were 
electronics manufacturing (led by companies such as General Electric, which 
produced transistor radios),[119] machinery and equipment, and food processing.[120] 
The city struggled to make a transition to new industries. During the second 
half of the 20th century, the city's recessions were longer than the national 
average.[121] The exodus of defense companies (such as Lockheed Martin, 
formed from the merger of the Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta 
in 1995) and the electrical-manufacturing industry played a major role 
in Utica's recent economic distress.[121] From 1975 to 2001, the city's 
economic growth rate was similar to that of Buffalo, while other upstate 
New York cities such as Rochester and Binghamton outperformed both.[121] 
In the early 21st century, the Mohawk Valley economy is based on logistics, 
industrial processes, machinery, and industrial services.[122] In Rome, 
the former Griffiss Air Force Base has remained a regional employer as 
a technology center. The Turning Stone Resort & Casino in Verona is a tourist 
destination, with a number of expansions during the 1990s and 2000s.[123] 
Utica's larger employers include the ConMed Corporation (a surgical-device 
and orthotics manufacturer)[124] and Faxton St. Luke's Healthcare, the 
city's primary health care system.[125] Construction, such as the North-South 
Arterial Highway project, supports the public-sector job market.[126] Although 
passenger and commercial traffic on the Erie Canal has declined greatly 
since the 19th century, the barge canal still allows heavy cargo to travel 
through Utica at low cost, bypassing the New York State Thruway and providing 
intermodal freight transport with the railroads.[127] Democrat Robert M. 
Palmieri, elected in 2011, is Utica's current mayor.[129][130] The common 
council consists of 10 members, six of whom are elected from single-member 
districts. The other four, including its president, are elected at-large.[131] 
The council has eight standing committees for issues including transportation, 
education, finance and public safety.[132] There is a relative balance 
between the Democratic and Republican parties, a change from the predominantly 
single-party politics of the 20th century.[133] Throughout the 1950s, Democrats 
ran the city council and mayoralty.[134] Utica is in New York's 22nd congressional 
district, which has been represented by Republican Richard L. Hanna since 
2013. The city is served by the United States District Court for the Northern 
District of New York, with offices in the Alexander Pirnie Federal Building.[135] 
According to the comptroller's office, Utica's governmental expenses totaled 
$79.3 million in 2014 (a net increase of $940,000 from the previous year).[136] 
The 2015–16 budget proposes general-fund spending of $66.3 million.[137] 
City taxes collected in 2014 were $25,972,930, with a tax rate per thousand 
of $25.24.[137] According to the city's police department, there were six 
murders, 125 robberies, 22 rapes, and 237 assaults in 2014 (an increase 
from the previous year, representing a violent-crime rate of 0.6 percent). 
There were 432 burglaries, 1,845 larcenies and 107 motor-vehicle thefts 
(a decrease from 2013, representing a property-crime rate of 3.8 percent). 
Compared to other cities in New York, Utica's crime rate is generally low.[138][139] 
The Utica Police Department patrols the city, and law enforcement is also 
under the jurisdiction of the Oneida County Sheriff's Office and the New 
York State Police.[140] The Utica Fire Department coordinates four engines, 
two truck companies, and rescue, HAZMAT and medical operations with a 123-person 
crew.[141] Utica's position in the northeastern United States has allowed 
the blending of cultures and traditions. The city shares characteristics 
with other cities in Central New York, including its dialect (Inland Northern 
American English, also present in other Rust Belt cities such as Buffalo, 
Elmira and Erie, Pennsylvania).[142] Utica shares a cuisine with the mid-Atlantic 
states, with local and regional influences. The city's melting pot of immigrant 
and refugee cuisines,[143] including Dutch, Italian, German, Irish and 
Bosnian,[63] has introduced dishes such as ćevapi and pasticciotti[e] to 
the community.[146][147] Utica staple foods include chicken riggies,[148] 
Utica greens,[149] half-moons,[150][151] mushroom stew,[152] and tomato 
pie.[153] Other popular dishes are pierogi, penne alla vodka, and sausage 
and peppers.[154][155] Utica has long had ties to the brewing industry. 
The family-owned Matt Brewing Company resisted the bankruptcies and plant 
closings that came with the industry consolidation under a few national 
brands. As of 2012, it was ranked the 15th-largest brewery by sales in 
the United States.[156][157] The annual 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) Boilermaker 
Road Race, organized by the city in conjunction with the National Distance 
Running Hall of Fame, attracts runners from the region and around the world, 
including Kenya and Romania.[158][159] The Children's Museum of Natural 
History, Science and Technology, next to Union Station, opened in 1963. 
In 2002 the museum partnered with NASA, featuring exhibits and events from 
the agency.[160][161] The Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute, founded 
in 1919, features a PrattMWP program in cooperation with the Pratt Institute, 
and permanent collections and rotating exhibits.[162] The Utica Psychiatric 
Center is housed in a Greek Revival structure that was an insane asylum, 
and the birthplace of the Utica crib—a restraining device frequently used 
at the asylum from the mid-19th century to 1887.[13][163][164][165] The 
Stanley Center for the Arts, a mid-sized concert and performance venue, 
was designed by Thomas W. Lamb in 1928 and today features theatrical and 
musical performances by local and touring groups.[166] The Hotel Utica, 
designed by Esenwein & Johnson in 1912, became a nursing and residential-care 
facility during the 1970s.[167][168] Notable guests had included Franklin 
D. Roosevelt, Judy Garland and Bobby Darin. It was restored as a hotel 
in 2001.[168][169] Utica is home to the Utica Comets, a team affiliated 
with the National Hockey League's Vancouver Canucks. Formerly the Peoria 
Rivermen, the team moved to Utica and began playing in the American Hockey 
League during the 2013–14 season.[170][171] The 3,815-seat Utica Memorial 
Auditorium, which opened in 1960, is home to the Comets and the Utica College 
Pioneers. The Utica Devils played in the AHL from 1987 to 1993, and the 
Utica Bulldogs (1993–94), Utica Blizzard (1994–97), and Mohawk Valley Prowlers 
(1998–2001) were members of the United Hockey League (UHL).[172] The city 
was home to the Utica Blue Sox (1939–2001), a New York–Penn League baseball 
team also affiliated with the Toronto Blue Jays and, later, the Miami Marlins. 
Other former baseball teams included the Utica Asylums (1900) and the Boston 
Braves-affiliated Utica Braves (1939–42).[173] Utica's parks system consists 
of 677 acres (274 ha) of parks and recreation centers; most of the city's 
parks have community centers and swimming pools.[179] Frederick Law Olmsted, 
Jr., who designed New York City's Central Park and Delaware Park in Buffalo, 
designed the Utica Parks and Parkway Historic District.[180] Olmsted also 
designed Memorial Parkway, a 4-mile (6.4 km) tree-lined boulevard connecting 
the district's parks and encircling the city's southern neighborhoods.[181][182] 
The district includes Roscoe Conkling Park, the 62-acre F.T. Proctor Park, 
the Parkway, and T.R. Proctor Park.[183][184] The city's municipal golf 
course, Valley View (designed by golf-course architect Robert Trent Jones), 
is in the southern part of the city near the town of New Hartford.[179] 
The Utica Zoo and the Val Bialas Ski Chalet, an urban ski slope featuring 
skiing, snowboarding, outdoor skating, and tubing, are also in south Utica 
in Roscoe Conkling Park.[185] Smaller neighborhood parks in the district 
include Addison Miller Park, Chancellor Park, Seymour Park, and Wankel 
Park.[186] Griffiss International Airport in Rome primarily serves military 
and general aviation, and Syracuse Hancock International Airport and Albany 
International Airport provide regional, domestic, and international passenger 
air travel in the Utica–Rome Metropolitan Area.[187] Amtrak's Empire, Maple 
Leaf, and Lake Shore Limited trains stop at Utica's Union Station. Bus 
service is provided by the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority 
(CENTRO), a Syracuse public transport operator which runs 12 lines in Utica 
and has a downtown hub.[188] Intercity bus service is provided by Greyhound 
Lines and the Birnie Bus Company, with weekday and Saturday service to 
Syracuse;[189] both stop at Union Station.[190][191] During the 1960s and 
1970s, New York state planners envisioned a system of arterial roads in 
Utica that would include connections to Binghamton and Interstate 81.[192] 
Due to community opposition,[193] only parts of the highway project were 
completed, including the North–South Arterial Highway running west of the 
city.[192][194] Six New York State highways, one three-digit interstate 
highway, and one two-digit interstate highway pass through Utica. New York 
State Route 49 and State Route 840 are east–west expressways running along 
Utica's northern and southern borders, respectively, and the eastern terminus 
of each is in the city. New York State Route 5 and its alternate routes—State 
Route 5S and State Route 5A—are east–west roads and expressways that pass 
through Utica. The western terminus of Route 5S and the eastern terminus 
of Route 5A are both in the city. With Route 5 and Interstate 790 (an auxiliary 
highway of Interstate 90), New York State Route 12 and State Route 8 form 
the North–South Arterial Highway.[195] Electricity in Utica is provided 
by National Grid plc, a British energy corporation that acquired the city's 
former electricity provider, Niagara Mohawk, in 2002.[196] Utica is near 
the crossroads of major electrical-transmission lines,[197] with substations 
in the town of Marcy. An expansion project by the New York Power Authority, 
National Grid, Consolidated Edison, and New York State Electric and Gas 
(NYSEG) is planned.[198][199] In 2009 city businesses (including Utica 
College and St. Luke's Medical Center) developed a microgrid, and in 2012 
the Utica City Council explored the possibility of a public, city-owned 
power company.[200][201][202] Utica's natural gas is provided by National 
Grid[203] and NYSEG.[204][205] Municipal solid waste is collected and disposed

Utica's wastewater is treated by the Mohawk Valley Water Authority, with 
a capacity of 32 million gallons per day.[208][209] Treated water is tested 
for impurities including pathogens, nitrates, and nitrites.[208] Utica's 
drinking water comes from the stream-fed Hinckley Reservoir in the foothills
