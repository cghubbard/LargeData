The NC Dinos (Korean: 엔씨 다이노스) are a Korean professional baseball team 
founded in 2011. Their home stadium is Masan Baseball Stadium in the southeastern 
city of Changwon. They were a member of the Freedom Division of the Korea 
Baseball Futures League, which is not affiliated with Korea Baseball Organization. 
On May 8, 2012, the Korean Baseball Organization officially approved NC 
Dinos' admission to the KBO League to start off the 2013 season. On April 
11, 2013, the NC Dinos won their first game in the club's history against 
the LG Twins.[1] On July 1, 2010, three cities, which were Changwon, Masan 
and Jinhae, ware integrated into one city, Changwon. After the integration, 
Changwon drove forward the project, which attracted a baseball team in 
the city. On December 22, 2010, video game company NC Soft submitted a 
plan that it wanted to found a baseball team to KBO. The NC Dinos have 
three dinosaurs for their mascots. The first is Dandi, the Tyrannosaurus. 
The second is Sseri, the Brachiosaurus. The third is Crong, the baby dinosaur.[2]
