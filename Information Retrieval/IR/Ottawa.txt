Ottawa (i/ˈɒtəwə/ or /ˈɒtəwɑː/; French pronunciation: ​[ɔtawa]) is the 
capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River 
in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; 
the two form the core of the Ottawa–Gatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) 
and the National Capital Region (NCR).[10] The 2011 census reported a population 
of 883,391 making it the fourth-largest city in Canada, and 1,236,324 within 
the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa 
reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 
2015.[11] Founded in 1826 as Bytown, and incorporated as "Ottawa" in 1855, 
the city has evolved into a political and technological centre of Canada. 
Its original boundaries were expanded through numerous minor annexations 
and were ultimately replaced by a new city incorporation and major amalgamation 
in 2001 which significantly increased its land area. The city name "Ottawa" 
was chosen in reference to the Ottawa River nearby, which is a word derived 
from the Algonquin word Odawa, meaning "to trade".[12] The city is the 
most educated in Canada,[13] and it is home to a number of post-secondary, 
research, and cultural institutions, including the National Arts Centre 
and the National Gallery. Ottawa also has the highest standard of living 
in the nation and low unemployment. It ranked second out of 150[14] worldwide 
in the Numbeo quality of life index 2014-2015, and it contains a UNESCO 
World Heritage Site. With the draining of the Champlain Sea around ten 
thousand years ago the Ottawa Valley became habitable.[15] The area was 
used for wild edible harvesting, hunting, fishing, trade, travel, and camps 
for over 6500 years by local populations. The Ottawa river valley has archaeological 
sites with arrow heads, pottery, and stone tools. The area has three major 
rivers that meet, making it an important trade and travel area for thousands 
of years.[16] The Algonquins called the Ottawa River Kichi Sibi or Kichissippi 
meaning "Great River" or "Grand River".[17][18][19][20] Étienne Brûlé, 
the first European to travel up the Ottawa River, passed by Ottawa in 1610 
on his way to the Great Lakes.[18] Three years later, Samuel de Champlain 
wrote about the waterfalls of the area and about his encounters with the 
Algonquins, who had been using the Ottawa River for centuries.[21] The 
early explorers and traders were later followed by many missionaries. The 
first maps of the area used the word Ottawa to name the river. Philemon 
Wright, a New Englander, created the first settlement in the area on 7 
March 1800 on the north side of the river, across from Ottawa in Hull.[22][23] 
He, with five other families and twenty-five labourers,[17] set about to 
create an agricultural community[24] called Wrightsville. Wright pioneered 
the Ottawa Valley timber trade (soon to be the area's most significant 
economic activity) by transporting timber by river from the Ottawa Valley 
to Quebec City.[25] Bytown, Ottawa's original name, was founded as a community 
in 1826 when hundreds of land speculators were attracted to the south side 
of the river when news spread that British authorities were immediately 
constructing the northerly end of the Rideau Canal military project at 
that location.[26][27] The following year, the town would soon be named 
after British military engineer Colonel John By who was responsible for 
the entire Rideau Waterway construction project. The military purpose of 
the canal was to provide a secure route between Montreal and Kingston on 
Lake Ontario, bypassing the stretch of the St. Lawrence River bordering 
the state of New York that had left the British forces easily exposed to 
American enemy fire during the War of 1812.[28] Colonel By set up military 
barracks on the site of today's Parliament Hill. He also laid out the streets 
of the town and created two distinct neighbourhoods named "Upper Town" 
west of the canal and "Lower Town" east of the canal. Similar to its Upper 
Canada and Lower Canada namesakes, historically 'Upper Town' was predominantly 
English speaking and Protestant whereas 'Lower Town' was predominantly 
French, Irish and Catholic.[29] Bytown's population grew to 1,000 as the 
Rideau Canal was being completed in 1832.[30][31] Bytown encountered some 
impassioned and violent times in her early pioneer period that included 
Irish labour unrest that attributed to the Shiners' War from 1835 to 1845[32] 
and political dissension that was evident from the 1849 Stony Monday Riot.[33] 
In 1855 Bytown was renamed Ottawa and incorporated as a city.[34] On New 
Year's Eve 1857, Queen Victoria, as a symbolic and political gesture, was 
presented with the responsibility of selecting a location for the permanent 
capital of the Province of Canada.[35] In reality, Prime Minister John 
A. Macdonald had assigned this selection process to the Executive Branch 
of the Government, as previous attempts to arrive at a consensus had ended 
in deadlock.[36] The 'Queen's choice' turned out to be the small frontier 
town of Ottawa for two main reasons:[37] Firstly, Ottawa's isolated location 
in a back country surrounded by dense forest far from the Canada–US border 
and situated on a cliff face would make it more defensible from attack.[38][39] 
Secondly, Ottawa was located approximately midway between Toronto and Kingston 
(in Canada West) and Montreal and Quebec City (in Canada East). Additionally, 
despite Ottawa's regional isolation it had seasonal water transportation 
access to Montreal over the Ottawa River and to Kingston via the Rideau 
Waterway. By 1854 it also had a modern all season Bytown and Prescott Railway 
that carried passengers, lumber and supplies the 82-kilometre distance 
to Prescott on the Saint Lawrence River and beyond.[17][38] The small size 
of the town it was thought would make it less prone to rampaging politically 
motivated mobs, as had happened in the previous Canadian capitals.[40] 
The government already owned the land that would eventually become Parliament 
Hill which they thought would be an ideal location for building the Parliament 
Buildings. Ottawa was the only settlement of any substantial size that 
was already located directly on the border of French populated former Lower 
Canada and English populated former Upper Canada thus additionally making 
the selection an important political compromise.[41] Queen Victoria made 
her 'Queen's choice' very quickly just before welcoming in the New Year. 
Starting in the 1850s, large sawmills began to be erected by entrepreneurs 
known as lumber barons, and these became some of the largest mills in the 
world.[42] Rail lines erected in 1854 connected Ottawa to areas south and 
to the transcontinental rail network via Hull and Lachute, Quebec in 1886.[43] 
The original Parliament buildings which included the Centre, East and West 
Blocks were constructed between 1859 and 1866 in the Gothic Revival style.[44] 
At the time, this was the largest North American construction project ever 
attempted and Public Works Canada and its architects were not initially 
well prepared. The Library of Parliament and Parliament Hill landscaping 
would not be completed until 1876.[45] By 1885 Ottawa was the only city 
in Canada whose downtown street lights were powered entirely by electricity.[46] 
In 1889 the Government developed and distributed 60 'water leases' (still 
currently in use) to mainly local industrialists which gave them permission 
to generate electricity and operate hydroelectric generators at Chaudière 
Falls.[47] Public transportation began in 1870 with a horsecar system,[48] 
overtaken in the 1890s by a vast electric streetcar system that lasted 
until 1959. The Hull–Ottawa fire of 1900 destroyed two thirds of Hull, 
including 40 per cent of its residential buildings and most of its largest 
employers along the waterfront.[49] The fire also spread across the Ottawa 
River and destroyed about one fifth of Ottawa from the Lebreton Flats south 
to Booth Street and down to Dow's Lake.[50] On 1 June 1912 the Grand Trunk 
Railway opened both the Château Laurier hotel and its neighbouring downtown 
Union Station.[51][52] On 3 February 1916 the Centre Block of the Parliament 
buildings was destroyed by a fire.[53] The House of Commons and Senate 
was temporarily relocated to the then recently constructed Victoria Memorial 
Museum, now the Canadian Museum of Nature[54] until the completion of the 
new Centre Block in 1922, the centrepiece of which is a dominant Gothic 
revival styled structure known as the Peace Tower.[55] The current location 
of what is now known as Confederation Square was a former commercial district 
centrally located in a triangular area downtown surrounded by historically 
significant heritage buildings which includes the Parliament buildings. 
It was redeveloped as a ceremonial centre in 1938 as part of the City Beautiful 
Movement and became the site of the National War Memorial in 1939 and designated 
a National Historic Site in 1984.[56] A new Central Post Office (currently 
the Privy Council of Canada) was constructed in 1939 beside the War Memorial 
because the original post office building located on the proposed Confederation 
Square grounds had to be demolished. Ottawa's former industrial appearance 
was vastly altered by the 1950 Greber Plan. French architect-planner Jacques 
Greber was hired by then Prime Minister Mackenzie King to design an urban 
plan for managing development in the National Capital Region to make it 
more aesthetically pleasing and thus more befitting a location that was 
the political centre of Canada.[57][58] Greber's plan included the creation 
of the National Capital Greenbelt, the Parkway, the Queensway highway system, 
the relocation of downtown Union Station (now the Government Conference 
Centre) to the suburbs, the removal of the street car system, the decentralization 
of selected government offices, the relocation of industries and removal 
of substandard housing from the downtown and the creation of the Rideau 
Canal and Ottawa River pathways to name just a few of its recommendations.[57][59][60] 
In 1958 the National Capital Commission was established as a Crown Corporation 
from the passing of the National Capital Act in order to implement the 
Greber Plan recommendations which it successfully accomplished during the 
1960s and 1970s. In the previous 50 years, other commissions, plans and 
projects had tried and failed to implement plans to improve the capital 
such as the 1899 Ottawa Improvement Commission (OIC), The Todd Plan in 
1903, The Holt Report in 1915 and The Federal District Commission (FDC) 
established in 1927.[61] In 1958 a new City Hall opened on Green Island 
near Rideau falls where urban renewal had recently transformed this former 
industrial location into green space.[62] Until then, City Hall had temporarily 
been located for 27 years (1931-1958) at the Transportation Building adjacent 
to Union Station and now part of the Rideau Centre. In 2001, Ottawa City 
Hall moved back downtown to a relatively new building (1990) on 110 Laurier 
Avenue West that had been the home of the now defunct Regional Municipality 
of Ottawa-Carleton. This new downtown location was very close to Ottawa's 
first (1849-1877) and second (1877-1931) City Halls. Also included in this 
new city hall complex was an adjacent 19th century restored heritage building 
formerly known as the Ottawa Normal School.[62] From the 1960s until the 
1980s, the National Capital Region experienced a building boom.[63] This 
was followed by large growth in the high-tech industry during the 1990s 
and 2000s.[64] Ottawa became one of Canada's largest high tech cities and 
was nicknamed Silicon Valley North. By the 1980s, Bell Northern Research 
(later Nortel) employed thousands, and large federally assisted research 
facilities such as the National Research Council contributed to an eventual 
technology boom. The early adopters led to offshoot companies such as Newbridge 
Networks, Mitel and Corel. Ottawa's city limits had been increasing over 
the years, but it acquired the most territory on 1 January 2001, when it 
amalgamated all the municipalities of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton 
into one single city.[65] Regional Chair Bob Chiarelli was elected as the 
new city's first mayor in the 2000 municipal election, defeating Gloucester 
mayor Claudette Cain. The city's growth led to strains on the public transit 
system and to bridges. On 15 October 2001, a diesel-powered light rail 
transit (LRT) line was introduced on an experimental basis. This line, 
known today as the Trillium Line, was dubbed the O-Train and connected 
downtown Ottawa to the southern suburbs via Carleton University. The decision 
to extend the O-Train, and to replace it with an electric light rail system 
was a major issue in the 2006 municipal elections where Chiarelli was defeated 
by businessman Larry O'Brien. After O'Brien's election transit plans were 
changed to establish a series of light rail stations from the east side 
of the city into downtown, and for using a tunnel through the downtown 
core. Jim Watson, who had been the last mayor of Ottawa prior to amalgamation, 
was re-elected in the 2010 election.[66] In October 2012, City Council 
approved the final Lansdowne Park plan, an agreement with the Ottawa Sports 
and Entertainment Group that will see a new stadium, increased green space, 
and housing and retail added to the site.[67][68] In December 2012, City 
Council voted unanimously to move forward with the Confederation Line, 
a 12.5 km light rail transit line, to be fully operational by 2018.[69] 
Ottawa is situated on the south bank of the Ottawa River and contains the 
mouths of the Rideau River and Rideau Canal.[70] The older part of the 
city (including what remains of Bytown) is known as Lower Town, and occupies 
an area between the canal and the rivers. Across the canal to the west 
lies Centretown and Downtown Ottawa, which is the city's financial and 
commercial hub and home to the Parliament of Canada and numerous federal 
government department headquarters, notably the Privy Council Office. On 
29 June 2007, the Rideau Canal, which stretches 202 km (126 mi) to Kingston, 
Fort Henry and four Martello towers in the Kingston area was recognized 
as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[71] Located on a major, yet mostly dormant 
fault line,[72] Ottawa is occasionally struck by earthquakes. Examples 
include a magnitude 5.2 earthquake on 1 January 2000,[73] a magnitude 4.5 
earthquake on 24 February 2006,[74] a magnitude 5.0 earthquake on 23 June 
2010,[75] and a magnitude 5.2 earthquake on 17 May 2013.[76] Ottawa sits 
at the confluence of three major rivers: the Ottawa River, the Gatineau 
River and the Rideau River.[77] The Ottawa and Gatineau rivers were historically 
important in the logging and lumber industries and the Rideau as part of 
the Rideau Canal system for military, commercial and, subsequently, recreational 
purposes.[77] The Rideau Canal (Rideau Waterway) first opened in 1832 and 
is 202 kilometres in length. It connects the Saint Lawrence River on Lake 
Ontario at Kingston to the Ottawa River near Parliament Hill. It was able 
to bypass the unnavigable sections of the Cataraqui and Rideau Rivers and 
various small lakes along the waterway due to flooding techniques and the 
construction of 47 water transport locks.The Rideau River got its name 
from early French explorers who thought that the water falls located at 
the point where the Rideau River empties into the Ottawa River resembled 
a 'curtain'. Hence they began naming the falls and river 'rideau' which 
is the French equivalent of the English word for curtain.[78][21] During 
part of the winter season the Ottawa section of the canal forms the world's 
largest skating rink thereby providing both a recreational venue and a 
7.8 kilometres (4.8 mi) transportation path to downtown for ice skaters 
(from Carleton University and Dow's Lake to the Rideau Centre and National 
Arts Centre).[79] Across the Ottawa River, which forms the border between 
Ontario and Quebec, lies the city of Gatineau, itself the result of amalgamation 
of the former Quebec cities of Hull and Aylmer together with Gatineau.[80] 
Although formally and administratively separate cities in two separate 
provinces, Ottawa and Gatineau (along with a number of nearby municipalities) 
collectively constitute the National Capital Region, which is considered 
a single metropolitan area. One federal crown corporation, the National 
Capital Commission, or NCC, has significant land holdings in both cities, 
including sites of historical and touristic importance. The NCC, through 
its responsibility for planning and development of these lands, is an important 
contributor to both cities. Around the main urban area is an extensive 
greenbelt, administered by the NCC for conservation and leisure, and comprising 
mostly forest, farmland and marshland.[81] Ottawa has a humid continental 
climate (Köppen Dfb)[82] with four distinct seasons and is between Zones 
5a and 5b on the Canadian Plant Hardiness Scale.[83] The average July maximum 
temperature is 26.5 °C (80 °F). The average January minimum temperature 
is −14.8 °C (5.4 °F) Summers are warm and humid in Ottawa. On average 11 
days of the three summer months have temperatures exceeding 30 °C (86 °F), 
or 37 days if the humidex is considered. Average relative humidity averages 
54% in the afternoon and 84% by morning. Snow and ice are dominant during 
the winter season. On average Ottawa receives 224 centimetres (88 in) of 
snowfall annually but maintains an average 22 centimetres (9 in) of snowpack 
throughout the three winter months. An average 16 days of the three winter 
months experience temperatures below −20 °C (−4 °F), or 41 days if the 
wind chill is considered.[84] Spring and fall are variable, prone to extremes 
in temperature and unpredictable swings in conditions. Hot days above 30 °C 
(86 °F) have occurred as early as 17 April[85] or as late as 22 September,[86] 
although such events are unusual and brief.[84] Annual precipitation averages 
around 940 millimetres (37 in). There are about 2130 hours of average sunshine 
annually (46% of possible). Winds in Ottawa are generally Westerlies averaging 
13 km/h but tend to be slightly more dominant during the winter.[84] The 
highest temperature ever recorded in Ottawa was 37.8 °C (100 °F) on 4 July 
1913, 1 August 1917 and 11 August 1944.[84][87] The coldest temperature 
ever recorded was −38.9 °C (−38 °F) on 29 December 1933.[84] Ottawa is 
bounded on the east by the United Counties of Prescott and Russell; by 
Renfrew County and Lanark County in the west; on the south by the United 
Counties of Leeds and Grenville and the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas 
and Glengarry; and on the north by the Regional County Municipality of 
Les Collines-de-l'Outaouais and the City of Gatineau.[99] Modern Ottawa 
is made up of eleven historic townships, ten of which are from Carleton 
County and one from Russell.[100] The city has a main urban area but there 
are many other urban, suburban and rural areas within the modern city's 
limits.[101] The main suburban area extends a considerable distance to 
the east, west and south of the centre,[101] and it includes the former 
cities of Gloucester, Nepean and Vanier, the former village of Rockcliffe 
Park (a high-income neighbourhood which is home to the Prime Minister's 
official residence at 24 Sussex and the Governor General's residence), 
and the communities of Blackburn Hamlet and Orléans.[102] The Kanata suburban 
area includes the former village of Stittsville to the southwest.[102] 
Nepean is another major suburb which also includes Barrhaven.[102] There 
are also the communities of Manotick and Riverside South on the other side 
of the Rideau River, and Greely, southeast of Riverside South.[102] There 
are a number of rural communities (villages and hamlets) that lie beyond 
the greenbelt but are administratively part of the Ottawa municipality.[101] 
Some of these communities are Burritts Rapids; Ashton; Fallowfield; Kars; 
Fitzroy Harbour; Munster; Carp; North Gower; Metcalfe; Constance Bay and 
Osgoode and Richmond.[102] There are also a number of towns located within 
the federally defined National Capital Region but outside the city of Ottawa 
municipal boundaries,[101] these include the urban communities of Almonte, 
Carleton Place, Embrun, Kemptville, Rockland, and Russell.[102] In 2011, 
the populations of the City of Ottawa and the Ottawa-Gatineau census metropolitan 
area (CMA) were 883,391 and 1,236,324 respectively.[103][104] The city 
had a population density of 316.6 persons per km2 in 2006, while the CMA 
had a population density of 196.6 persons per km2.[103][104] It is the 
second-largest city in Ontario, fourth-largest city in the country, and 
the fourth-largest CMA in the country. Ottawa's median age of 39.2 is both 
below the provincial and national averages as of 2011[update].[103][105][106] 
Youths under 15 years of age comprised 16.8% of the total population as 
of 2011[update], while those of retirement age (65 years and older) comprised 
13.2%.[103] In 2011, females made up 51.5% of the amalgamated Ottawa population.[103] 
Between 1987 and 2002, 131,816 individuals relocated to the city, which 
represents 75% of the population growth for that period.[107] Over 20 percent 
of the city's population is foreign-born, with the most common non-Canadian 
countries of origin being the United Kingdom (8.8% of those foreign-born), 
China (8.0%), and Lebanon (4.8%). About 6.1% of residents are not Canadian 
citizens.[108] Members of visible minority groups (non-white/European) 
constitute 23.7%, while those of Aboriginal origin make up 2.1% of the 
total population. The largest visible minority groups are: Black Canadians: 
5.7%, Chinese Canadians: 4.0%, South Asians: 3.9%, and Arabs: 3.7%. Smaller 
groups include Latin Americans, Southeast Asians, Filipinos, and West Asians.[108] 
Around 65% of Ottawa residents describe themselves as Christian as of 2011[update], 
with Catholics accounting for 38.5% of the population and members of Protestant 
churches 25%. Non-Christian religions are also very well established in 
Ottawa, the largest being Islam (6.7%), Hinduism (1.4%), Buddhism (1.3%), 
and Judaism (1.2%). Those with no religious affiliation represent 22.8%.[108] 
Bilingualism became official policy for the conduct of municipal business 
in 2002,[109] and 37% of the population can speak both languages as of 
2006[update],[110] making it the largest city in Canada with both English 
and French as co-official languages.[111] Those that identify their mother 
tongue as English constitute 62.4 percent, while those with French as their 
mother tongue make up 14.2 percent of the population. In terms of respondents' 
knowledge of one or both official languages, 59.9 percent and 1.5 percent 
of the population have knowledge of English only and French only, respectively; 
while 37.2 percent have knowledge of both official languages. An additional 
20.4 percent of the population list languages other than English and French 
as their mother tongue. These include Arabic (3.2%), Chinese (3.0%), Spanish 
(1.2%), Italian (1.1%), and many others.[108] Ottawa's primary employers 
are the Public Service of Canada and the high-tech industry.[107] The national 
headquarters for many federal departments are located in Ottawa. The city 
has a high standard of living and low unemployment.[112][113] Mercer ranks 
Ottawa with the third highest quality of living of any large city in the 
Americas, and 16th highest in the world.[114] It is also rated the second 
cleanest city in Canada, and third cleanest city in the world.[115] In 
2012, the city was ranked for the third consecutive year as the best community 
in Canada to live in by MoneySense.[116] Ottawa had the fourth highest 
GDP growth rate among major Canadian cities in 2007 at 2.7%, which exceeded 
the Canadian average of 2.4%.[117] It is estimated that the National Capital 
Region attracts around 7.3 million tourists annually who spend about 1.18 
billion dollars.[118] The region of Ottawa-Gatineau has the third highest 
income of all major Canadian cities.[117] The average gross income in the 
region amounted to $40,078, an increase of 4.9% compared to the previous 
year.[117] The annual cost of living rate in 2007 grew 1.9%.[117] The Federal 
government is the city's largest employer, employing over 110,000 individuals 
from the National Capital region.[119] Ottawa is also an important technology 
centre; in 2015, its 1800 companies employ approximately 63,400 people.[120] 
The concentration of companies in this industry earned the city the nickname 
of "Silicon Valley North."[64] Most of these companies specialize in telecommunications, 
software development and environmental technology. Large technology companies 
such as Nortel, Corel, Mitel, Cognos, Halogen Software, Shopify and JDS 
Uniphase were founded in the city.[121] Ottawa also has regional locations 
for Nokia, 3M, Adobe Systems, Bell Canada, IBM and Hewlett-Packard.[122] 
Many of the telecommunications and new technology are located in the western 
part of the city (formerly Kanata). Another major employer is the health 
sector, which employs over 18,000 people.[123] There are four active general 
hospitals in the Ottawa area: Queensway-Carleton Hospital, The Ottawa Hospital, 
Montfort Hospital, and Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. There are 
also a number of specialized hospital facilities, such as the University 
of Ottawa Heart Institute and the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre.[124] 
Nordion, i-Stat as well as the National Research Council of Canada and 
OHRI are part of the growing life science sector.[125][126] Business, finance, 
administration, and sales and service occupations rank high among types 
of occupations.[110] Approximately ten percent of Ottawa's GDP is derived 
from finance, insurance and real estate whereas employment is in goods-producing 
industries is only half the national average.[127] The City of Ottawa is 
the second largest employer[128][129] with over 15,000 employees.[129][130] 
The National Defence Headquarters located in Ottawa is the main command 
centre for the Canadian Armed Forces and hosts the Department of National 
Defence.[131] The Ottawa area includes CFS Leitrim, CFB Uplands, and the 
former CFB Rockcliffe. During the summer, the city hosts the Ceremonial 
Guard, which performs functions such as the Changing the Guard.[132] In 
2006, Ottawa experienced an increase of 40,000 jobs over 2001 with a five-year 
average growth that was relative slower than in the late 1990s.[117] While 
the number of employees in the federal government stagnated, the high-technology 
industry grew by 2.4%. The overall growth of jobs in Ottawa-Gatineau was 
1.3% compared to the previous year, down to sixth place among Canada's 
largest cities.[117] The unemployment rate in Ottawa-Gatineau was 5.2% 
(only in Ottawa: 5.1%),[133] which was below the national average of 6.0%.[117] 
The economic downturn resulted in an increase in the unemployment rate 
between April 2008 and April 2009 from 4.7 to 6.3%. In the province, however, 
this rate increased over the same period from 6.4 to 9.1%.[134] Traditionally 
the ByWard Market (in Lower Town), Parliament Hill and the Golden Triangle 
(both in Centretown – Downtown) have been the focal points of the cultural 
scenes in Ottawa.[135] Modern thoroughfares such as Wellington Street, 
Rideau Street, Sussex Drive, Elgin Street, Bank Street, Somerset Street, 
Preston Street and Sparks Street are home to many boutiques, museums, theatres, 
galleries, landmarks and memorials in addition to eating establishments, 
cafes, bars and nightclubs.[136] Ottawa hosts a variety of annual seasonal 
activities—such as Winterlude, the largest festival in Canada,[137] and 
Canada Day celebrations on Parliament Hill and surrounding downtown area, 
as well as Bluesfest, Canadian Tulip Festival, Ottawa Dragon Boat Festival, 
Ottawa International Jazz Festival, Fringe Festival and Folk Music Festival, 
that have grown to become some of the largest festivals of their kind in 
the world.[138][139] In 2010, Ottawa's Festival industry received the IFEA 
"World Festival and Event City Award" for the category of North American 
cities with a population between 500,000 and 1,000,000.[140] As Canada's 
capital, Ottawa has played host to a number of significant cultural events 
in Canadian history, including the first visit of the reigning Canadian 
sovereign—King George VI, with his consort, Queen Elizabeth—to his parliament, 
on 19 May 1939.[141] VE Day was marked with a large celebration on 8 May 
1945,[142] the first raising of the country's new national flag took place 
on 15 February 1965,[143] and the centennial of Confederation was celebrated 
on 1 July 1967.[144] Elizabeth II was in Ottawa on 17 April 1982, to issue 
a royal proclamation of the enactment of the Constitution Act.[145] In 
1983, Prince Charles and Diana Princess of Wales came to Ottawa for a state 
dinner hosted by then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.[146] In 2011, Ottawa 
was selected as the first city to receive Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, 
and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge during their tour of Canada. Influenced 
by government structures, much of the city's architecture tends to be formalistic 
and functional. However, the city is also marked by Romantic and Picturesque 
styles of architecture such as the Parliament Buildings' gothic revival 
architecture.[147] Ottawa's domestic architecture is dominated by single 
family homes. There are also smaller numbers of semi-detached, rowhouses, 
and apartment buildings. Most domestic buildings are clad in brick, with 
small numbers covered in wood or stone. The skyline has been controlled 
by building height restrictions originally implemented to keep Parliament 
Hill and the Peace Tower at 92.2 metres (302 ft) visible from most parts 
of the city.[148] Today, several buildings are slightly taller than the 
Peace Tower, with the tallest located on Albert Street being the 29-storey 
Place de Ville (Tower C) at 112 metres (367 ft).[149] Federal buildings 
in the National Capital Region are managed by Public Works Canada, while 
most of the federal land in the region is managed by the National Capital 
Commission; its control of much undeveloped land gives the NCC a great 
deal of influence over the city's development.[150] Amongst the city's 
national museums and galleries is the National Gallery of Canada; designed 
by famous architect Moshe Safdie, it is a permanent home to the Maman sculpture.[152] 
The Canadian War Museum houses over 3.75 million artifacts and was moved 
to an expanded facility in 2005.[153] The Canadian Museum of Nature was 
built in 1905, and underwent a major renovation between 2004 and 2010.[154] 
Across the Ottawa river in Gatineau is the most visited museum in Canada, 
the Canadian Museum of History.[155] Designed by Canadian Aboriginal architect 
Douglas Cardinal, the curving-shaped complex, built at a cost of 340 million 
USD, also houses the Canadian Children's Museum, the Canadian Postal Museum 
and a 3D IMAX theatre.[156] The city is also home to the Canada Agriculture 
Museum, the Canada Aviation and Space Museum, the Canada Science and Technology 
Museum, Billings Estate Museum, Bytown Museum, Canadian Museum of Contemporary 
Photography, Canadian Ski Museum, Currency Museum, and the Portrait Gallery 
of Canada.[157] The Ottawa Little Theatre, originally called the Ottawa 
Drama League at its inception in 1913, is the longest-running community 
theatre company in Ottawa.[158] Since 1969, Ottawa has been the home of 
the National Arts Centre, a major performing arts venue that houses four 
stages and is home to the National Arts Centre Orchestra, the Ottawa Symphony 
Orchestra and Opera Lyra Ottawa.[159] Established in 1975, the Great Canadian 
Theatre Company specializes in the production of Canadian plays at a local 
level.[160] The Rideau Canal is the oldest continuously operated canal 
system in North America, and in 2007, it was registered as a UNESCO World 
Heritage Site.[161] In addition, there are 24 other National Historic Sites 
of Canada in Ottawa, including: the Central Chambers, the Central Experimental 
Farm, the Château Laurier, Confederation Square, the former Ottawa Teachers' 
College, Langevin Block, Laurier House and the Parliament Buildings. Many 
other properties of cultural value have been designated as having "heritage 
elements" by the City of Ottawa under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act.[162] 
Sport in Ottawa has a history dating back to the 19th century. Ottawa is 
currently home to four professional sports teams. The Ottawa Senators are 
a professional ice hockey team playing in the National Hockey League. The 
Senators play their home games at the Canadian Tire Centre.[163] The Ottawa 
Redblacks are a professional Canadian Football team playing in the Canadian 
Football League.[164] Professional soccer club Ottawa Fury FC play in the 
North American Soccer League, the second division in North American pro 
soccer after Major League Soccer. Both Ottawa Fury FC and the Ottawa Redblacks 
play their home games at TD Place Stadium. The Ottawa Champions play professional 
baseball in the Can-Am League at Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton Park, following 
the departure of the Lynx International League franchise. Several non-professional 
teams also play in Ottawa, including the Ottawa 67's junior ice hockey 
team.[165] Collegiate teams in various sports compete in Canadian Interuniversity 
Sport. The Carleton Ravens are nationally ranked in basketball,[166] and 
the Ottawa Gee-Gees are nationally ranked in football and basketball. Algonquin 
College has also won numerous national championships. The city is home 
to an assortment of amateur organized team sports such as soccer, basketball, 
baseball, curling, rowing, hurling and horse racing.[167] Casual recreational 
activities, such as skating, cycling, hiking, sailing, golfing, skiing 
and fishing/ice fishing are also popular.[167] The City of Ottawa is a 
single-tier municipality, meaning it is in itself a census division and 
has no county or regional municipality government above it.[168] As a single 
tier municipality, Ottawa has responsibility for all municipal services, 
including fire, emergency medical services, police, parks, roads, sidewalks, 
public transit, drinking water, storm water, sanitary sewage and solid 
waste. Ottawa is governed by the 24-member Ottawa City Council consisting 
of 23 councillors each representing one ward and the mayor, currently Jim 
Watson,[169] elected in a citywide vote. Along with being the capital of 
Canada, Ottawa is politically diverse in local politics. Most of the city 
has traditionally supported the Liberal Party.[170] Perhaps the safest 
areas for the Liberals are the ones dominated by Francophones, especially 
in Vanier and central Gloucester.[170] Central Ottawa is usually more left-leaning, 
and the New Democratic Party have won ridings there. Some of Ottawa's suburbs 
are swing areas, notably central Nepean and, despite its francophone population, 
Orléans.[170] The southern and western parts of the old city of Ottawa 
are generally moderate and swing to the Conservative Party.[170] The farther 
one goes outside the city centre like to Kanata and Barrhaven and rural 
areas, the voters tend to be increasingly conservative, both fiscally and 
socially.[170] This is especially true in the former Townships of West 
Carleton, Goulbourn, Rideau and Osgoode, which are more in line with the 
conservative areas in the surrounding counties.[170] However, not all rural 
areas support the Conservative Party. Rural parts of the former township 
of Cumberland, with a large number of Francophones, traditionally support 
the Liberal Party, though their support has recently weakened.[170] At 
present, Ottawa is host to 130 embassies.[171] A further 49 countries accredit 
their embassies and missions in the United States to Canada.[171] Ottawa 
is served by a number of airlines that fly into the Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier 
International Airport, as well as two main regional airports Gatineau-Ottawa 
Executive Airport, and Ottawa/Carp Airport.[172] The city is also served 
by inter-city passenger rail service at the Ottawa Train Station by Via 
Rail, located near the Alta Vista neighbourhood, and inter-city bus service 
operating out of the Ottawa Bus Central Station.[172] The public transit 
system is operated by OC Transpo, a department of the city.[173] An integrated 
hub-and-spoke system of services is available consisting of: regular buses 
travelling on fixed routes in mixed traffic, typical of most urban transit 
systems;[173] a bus rapid transit (BRT) system which is a high-frequency 
bus service operating on the transitway (a network of mostly grade-separated 
dedicated bus lanes within their own right of way) and having full stations 
with Park & Ride facilities, further supported by on-road reserved bus 
lanes and priority traffic signal controls; a light rail transit (LRT) 
system known as the O-Train operating on one north-south route (the Trillium 
Line);[173] and a door-to-door bus service for the disabled known as ParaTranspo.[173] 
Both OC Transpo and the Quebec-based Société de transport de l'Outaouais 
(STO) operate bus services between Ottawa and Gatineau. Construction is 
underway on the Confederation Line, a 12.5-kilometre (7.8 mi) light-rail 
transit line (LRT), which includes a 2.5-kilometre (1.6 mi) tunnel through 
the downtown area featuring three underground stations. The project broke 
ground in 2013, with operation scheduled to start in 2018.[174] A further 
30 kilometers and 19 stations will be built by 2023, referred to as the 
Stage 2 plan.[175] The city is served by two freeway corridors. The primary 
corridor is east-west and consists of provincial Highway 417 (designated 
as The Queensway) and Ottawa-Carleton Regional Road 174 (formerly Provincial 
Highway 17); a north-south corridor, Highway 416 (designated as Veterans' 
Memorial Highway), connects Ottawa to the rest of the 400-Series Highway 
network in Ontario at the 401. Highway 417 is also the Ottawa portion of 
the Trans-Canada Highway. The city also has several scenic parkways (promenades), 
such as Colonel By Drive, Queen Elizabeth Driveway, the Sir John A. Macdonald 
Parkway, Rockcliffe Parkway and the Aviation Parkway and has a freeway 
connection to Autoroute 5 and Autoroute 50, in Gatineau. In 2006, the National 
Capital Commission completed aesthetic enhancements to Confederation Boulevard, 
a ceremonial route of existing roads linking key attractions on both sides 
of the Ottawa River.[176] There are numerous paved multi-use trails that 
wind their way through much of the city, including along the Ottawa River, 
Rideau River, and Rideau Canal. These pathways are used for transportation, 
tourism, and recreation. Because most streets either have wide curb lanes 
or bicycle lanes, cycling is a popular mode of transportation in the region 
throughout the year.[177] As of December 31 2015, there are 900 km of cycling 
facilities located in Ottawa, including 435 km of multi use pathways, 8 
km of cycle tracks, 200 km of on-road bicycle lanes and 257 km of paved 
shoulders. [178] 204 km of new cycling facilities were added between 2011 
and 2014. [178] A downtown street that is restricted to pedestrians only, 
Sparks Street was turned into a pedestrian mall in 1966.[179] On 10 July 
2011 Ottawa saw its first dedicated, segregated bike lanes in the downtown 
core. The lane is separated from car traffic by a low concrete barrier 
with many gaps to allow for loading and unloading of people and goods. 
Ottawa's cycling advocacy group, Citizens for Safe Cycling, has been actively 
promoting safer cycling infrastructure in the community since 1984.[180] 
The city was designated as a "Gold" Bicycle Friendly Community in 2013 
by Share the Road Cycling Coalition, the first city in Ontario to receive 
this designation.[181] On Sundays (since 1960) and selected holidays and 
events additional avenues and streets are reserved for pedestrian and/or 
bicycle uses only.[182] In May 2011, The NCC introduced the Bixi Bike rental 
program.[183] Ottawa is known as one of the most educated cities in Canada, 
with over half the population having graduated from college and/or university.[184] 
Ottawa has the highest per capita concentration of engineers, scientists, 
and residents with PhDs in Canada.[185] The city has two main public universities: 
Ottawa also has two main public colleges – Algonquin College and La Cité 
collégiale. It also has two Catholic universities – Dominican University 
College and Saint Paul University. Other colleges and universities in nearby 
areas (namely, the neighbouring city of Gatineau) include the University 
of Quebec en Outaouais, Cégep de l'Outaouais, and Heritage College. There 
are four main public school boards in Ottawa: English, English-Catholic, 
French, and French-Catholic. The English-language Ottawa-Carleton District 
School Board (OCDSB) is the largest board with 147 schools,[189] followed 
by the English-Catholic Ottawa Catholic School Board with 85 schools.[190] 
The two French-language boards are the French-Catholic Conseil des écoles 
catholiques du Centre-Est with 49 schools,[191] and the French Conseil 
des écoles publiques de l'Est de l'Ontario with 37 schools.[192] Ottawa 
also has numerous private schools which are not part of a board. The Ottawa 
Public Library was created in 1906 as part of the famed Carnegie library 
system.[193] The library system had 2.3 million items as of 2008[update].[194] 
There are three main daily local newspapers printed in Ottawa: two English 
newspapers, the Ottawa Citizen established as the Bytown Packet in 1845 
and the Ottawa Sun, with 900,197 and 274,628 weekly circulation respectively, 
and one French newspaper, Le Droit.[195] Another free commuter daily paper, 
Metro Ottawa was added in the 2000s. Several weekly and monthly community 
papers are also published, including the Kitchissippi Times. A wide range 
of Canadian television broadcast networks and systems, and an extensive 
number of radio stations, are broadcast in both English and French. In 
addition to the market's local media services, Ottawa is also home to several 
national media operations, including CPAC (Canada's national legislature 
broadcaster) and the parliamentary bureau staff of virtually all of Canada's 
major newsgathering organizations in television, radio and print. The city 
is also home to the head office of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 
although it is not the primary production location of most CBC radio or
