Juan Manuel Nieves Cruz (born January 5, 1965 in Santurce, Puerto Rico)[1] 
is a former professional baseball pitcher and the pitching coach for the 
Miami Marlins. He is the former pitching coach for the Boston Red Sox. 
He played for the Milwaukee Brewers from 1986–1988. Nieves was signed by 
the Milwaukee Brewers, with a $115,000 signing bonus, after he went 19-1 
with a 1.05 ERA during his senior season at the Avon Old Farms school in 
Connecticut.[2] On April 15, 1987, against the Baltimore Orioles, became 
the second-youngest player in major league history to throw a no-hitter, 
and so far the only Milwaukee Brewer to do so.[3][4] Nieves' no-hitter 
became the first ever thrown by a Puerto Rican in Major League Baseball. 
After playing for the Brewers from 1986 to 1988, he suffered a career-ending 
arm injury. He worked as a minor league pitching instructor for the New 
York Yankees (1992–1996) and the White Sox (1999–2007) before joining the 
Chicago White Sox Major League staff as the bullpen coach serving for the 
five seasons.[5] He was mentored by Don Cooper, first when Cooper was the 
White Sox' roving coordinator in their minor league hierarchy, and later 
when Cooper became the pitching coach of the Sox.[6] They became really 
close, adapting similar pitching styles and was named as "Cooper's right-hand 
man".[6] He was named Boston's 2013 pitching coach on November 7, 2012. 
He brought over Cooper's style of pitching to the Red Sox organization.[6] 
Nieves led the Red Sox to the second lowest earned run average in the American 
League as the team went on to win the World Series.[6] After earning the 
second highest team ERA (4.86) to start the 2015 season, Nieves was dismissed
