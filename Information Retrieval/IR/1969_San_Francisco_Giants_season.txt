The 1969 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 87th year in Major 
League Baseball, their twelfth year in San Francisco since their move from 
New York following the 1957 season, and their tenth at Candlestick Park. 
The team finished second in the newly established National League West 
with a record of 90â€“72, 3 games behind the Atlanta Braves, their fifth 
consecutive season of finishing second. The Giants set a Major League record 
which still stands for the most double plays grounded into by a team in 
a single game, with 7 against the Houston Astros on May 4.[1] Infielders
