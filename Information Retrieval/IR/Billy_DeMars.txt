William Lester DeMars (born August 26, 1925) is a retired American shortstop 
and coach in Major League Baseball. He threw and batted right-handed, stood 
5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) tall and weighed 160 pounds (73 kg) during his 
playing career. He was born in Brooklyn, New York. Originally signed by 
his hometown Brooklyn Dodgers during the Second World War, DeMars was selected 
by the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1947 rule 5 draft after batting .328 
with 88 runs batted in for the Class B Asheville Tourists of the Tri-State 
League – DeMars' best overall season in professional baseball. He played 
in 80 big-league games over three seasons (1948; from 1950 to 1951) for 
the A's and the St. Louis Browns, batting .237 with no home runs and 14 
RBI in 211 at bats. He spent the prime of his career with the Triple-A 
Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League from 1952 to 1955. On May 
25, 1958 DeMars began an 11-year minor league managerial career in the 
Baltimore Orioles' farm system with the Class C Aberdeen Pheasants of the 
Northern League, who had lost 23 of their first 25 games. While the Pheasants 
continued to flounder under DeMars, winning only 37 of 100 games, the improved 
performance earned DeMars an invitation to return to the Orioles' system 
with the Class C Stockton Ports of the California League in 1959, where 
he posted a winning record. He managed in the Baltimore organization through 
1968 — working alongside future Major League managers such as Earl Weaver, 
Joe Altobelli, Darrell Johnson, Jim Frey, Clyde King, Cal Ripken, Sr., 
and Billy Hunter. He succeeded Weaver as pilot of the AAA Rochester Red 
Wings in 1968 and led the Red Wings into the playoffs. Overall, his managing 
record was 711 wins, 729 losses (.493) with one championship, won with 
the Class A Fox Cities Foxes of the Midwest League in 1964. DeMars began 
a 19-year Major League coaching career with the 1969 Philadelphia Phillies. 
He was a member of the Phillies' staff for 13 seasons, including the 1980 
world championship club – first in Phillies' history — and National League 
East Division champion teams in 1976–1977–1978. DeMars left the Phillies 
after the 1981 season and coached six more seasons with the Montreal Expos 
(1982–84) and Cincinnati Reds (1985–87), where he was a key advisor to 
playing manager Pete Rose; Rose called DeMars the best hitting coach with 
whom he had ever worked.[1] Although his 1987 resignation from the Cincinnati 
coaching staff ended his MLB career, DeMars remained in baseball and returned 
to the Phillies as a roving minor league batting instructor during the
