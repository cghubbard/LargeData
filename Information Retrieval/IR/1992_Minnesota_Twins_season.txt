Coming off a World Series victory, the 1992 Minnesota Twins continued the 
team's winning spree. The team finished in second place to Oakland Athletics 
and did not make it to the postseason. This would be the team's last winning 
season until 2001. Outfielder Kirby Puckett got 200 hits for the fifth 
time in his career, as well as 100 runs and 100 RBI. He also hit over .300 
for the seventh time in nine seasons. Finally, he hit the first three grand 
slams of his career. He was twice named American League Player of the Month. 
Puckett would go on to win his fifth Silver Slugger Award. Chuck Knoblauch 
and Shane Mack also notched 100 runs, making Puckett, Knoblauch, and Mack 
the first trio of Twins in team history to score 100 times in a season. 
First baseman Kent Hrbek began his fight against the injury bug, getting 
only 394 at-bats, a number that would decline over the next two years. 
Catcher Brian Harper had the second of three seasons batting over .300. 
Scott Leius saw a majority of the time at third base, but hit only .249 
with 2 home runs. In his last year with the Twins, shortstop Greg Gagne 
hit .246 — right around his career average. Pedro Muñoz saw a majority 
of the time in right field, while Chili Davis served as the designated 
hitter in his second and last year with the Twins. The first four pitchers 
in the starting rotation had winning records and solid ERAs, including 
John Smiley (16-9, 3.21), Kevin Tapani (16-11, 3.97), Scott Erickson (13-12, 
3.40), and Bill Krueger (10-6, 4.30). The fifth spot in the rotation was 
a question mark, with Pat Mahomes making 13 mediocre starts, Willie Banks 
12 poor starts, and Mike Trombley 7 reasonably capable ones. The bullpen 
was outstanding, anchored by closer Rick Aguilera. Aguilera earned 41 saves, 
and became the Twins' all-time leader in saves on September 1 when he earned 
his 109th with the team. The four regular arms in the bullpen all had ERAs 
under three: Carl Willis, Mark Guthrie, Tom Edens, and Gary Wayne. As expected 
for a Tom Kelly team, the defense was strong. Puckett would win the last 
of his six Gold Glove Awards. Hrbek was always strong at first base (although 
Don Mattingly prevented him from winning a Gold Glove), as was Knoblauch 
at second (at least at this point in his career). Gagne was a capable shortstop, 
but Leius was a question mark at third with a .955 fielding percentage. 
Mack and Muñoz had good years defensively alongside Puckett. [1] [2] [3]
