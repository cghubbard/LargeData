In baseball, the term battery refers collectively to the pitcher and the 
catcher, who may also be called batterymen[1] or batterymates of one another. 
The use of the word 'battery' in baseball was first coined by Henry Chadwick 
in the 1860s in reference to the firepower of a team's pitching staff and 
inspired by the artillery batteries then in use in the American Civil War.[2] 
Later, the term evolved to indicate the combined effectiveness of pitcher 
and catcher.[2] Some batteries are remarked upon as more than usually productive. 
Yogi Berra (catcher) and Whitey Ford (pitcher) were World-Series level 
players who were batterymates with the Yankees since Ford's rookie season 
in 1950.[3] They started 212 games together.[4][5] In the early 20th century, 
some prominent pitchers were known to have picked their favorite catchers. 
Sportswriter Fred Lieb recalls the batteries of Christy Mathewson/Frank 
Bowerman beginning in 1899 with the New York Giants, Jack Coombs/Jack Lapp 
beginning in 1908 with the Philadelphia Athletics, Cy Young/Lou Criger 
gaining the greatest attention in 1901 with the Boston Americans (later 
the Red Sox), and Grover Cleveland Alexander/Bill Killefer beginning in 
1911 with the Philadelphia Phillies.[6] In 1976, several major league pitchers 
chose their preferred catchers; a notion that had fallen out of practice 
for some decades. For instance, catcher Bob Boone of the Philadelphia Phillies, 
though one of the best catchers of his day, was replaced with Tim McCarver 
at the request of pitcher Steve Carlton. The Carlton/McCarver combination 
worked well in 32 out of Carlton's 35 games that season, plus one playoff 
game. The two had previously been batterymates for four years (1966-69) 
with the St. Louis Cardinals.[6] Another battery-by-choice was superstitious 
rookie pitcher Mark Fidrych who was new to the Detroit Tigers in 1976, 
insisting on rookie catcher Bruce Kimm behind the plate. The Fidrych/Kimm 
combination started all 29 of Fidrych's 1976 season games. The two continued 
as a battery through 1977.[6] Battery mates Jorge Posada and Andy Pettitte 
caught each other for 20 years from 1991 to 2011. Together they won five 
World Series Championships. On July 13, 2014, pitcher Madison Bumgarner 
and catcher Buster Posey of the San Francisco Giants became MLB's first 
battery to hit grand slams in the same game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
