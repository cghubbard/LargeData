Thomas James Lawless (born December 19, 1956 in Erie, Pennsylvania) was 
a Major League Baseball player between 1982 and 1990, playing for the Cincinnati 
Reds, Montreal Expos, St. Louis Cardinals, and Toronto Blue Jays. He was 
recently the interim manager for the Houston Astros. Although just a fringe, 
part-time player throughout his career, Lawless was involved in a number 
of dramatic and historic moments. Lawless became famous in 1984 when he 
became the only player ever traded for the great Pete Rose. Lawless, who 
only hit two regular-season home runs his entire career, is also remembered 
for his dramatic game-winning home run in Game 4 of the 1987 World Series 
(he had hit .080 in 25 at-bats during the regular season.) Lawless later 
expressed shock that he had managed to hit a home run. "When it went over 
the wall, I thought, 'Holy cow, it went out.' I went blank. I don't remember 
flipping the bat."[1] On May 10, 1989, while with the Toronto Blue Jays, 
Lawless' ninth-inning single broke up a no-hit bid by Mark Langston of 
the Seattle Mariners.[2] A fast and highly skilled baserunner, Lawless 
struggled to hit major league pitching and retired in 1990. He entered 
the coaching ranks and has become a successful minor league manager. In 
2007, he served as a coach for the China national baseball team during 
its participation in Major League Baseball's Instructional League program 
and in the Arizona Fall League. He managed the Lexington Legends, the Class 
A affiliate of the Houston Astros, for the 2009 season. On November 16, 
2009, Lawless was named the new manager for the Lancaster JetHawks, the 
Class A Advanced affiliate of the Houston Astros, for the 2010 season. 
In 2011, Lawless was managing the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Texas League. 
On September 1, 2014 after the Astros fired Bo Porter, Lawless was hired 
as the interim manager.[3] As interim manager with Houston, he had a record
