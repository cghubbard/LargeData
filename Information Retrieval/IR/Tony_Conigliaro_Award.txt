The Tony Conigliaro Award is a national award instituted in 1990 by the 
Boston Red Sox to honor the memory of Tony Conigliaro. It is given annually 
to a Major League Baseball (MLB) player who best "overcomes an obstacle 
and adversity through the attributes of spirit, determination, and courage 
that were trademarks of Conigliaro." Conigliaro debuted with the Red Sox 
in 1964, and was selected to the MLB All-Star Game in 1967. He was hit 
in the face by a pitch at Fenway Park on August 18, 1967. After missing 
the rest of the 1967 season and all of 1968, he made a comeback in 1969, 
homering on opening day. He hit 20 home runs in 1969, winning The Sporting 
News Comeback Player of the Year Award. The following season, he had career 
highs in home runs with 36 and RBIs with 116, but vision problems continued 
to persist; his performance fell off, and he was never the same player. 
After a final comeback attempt in 1975, Conigliaro retired at age 30.[1] 
Conigliaro died in 1990, and the Red Sox instituted the award in his honor.[2] 
A special panel is composed of the media, representatives of the commissioner, 
and the two leagues' offices. The selection is made by a panel of voters 
and the award is presented at the annual dinner of the Boston chapter of 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America, held in January, by members
