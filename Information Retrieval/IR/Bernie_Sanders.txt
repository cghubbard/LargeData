U.S. Senator from Vermont U.S. Representative for Vermont's At-large Mayor 
of Burlington Bernard "Bernie" Sanders (born September 8, 1941) is an American 
politician who has been the junior United States Senator from Vermont since 
2007. Sanders is the longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional 
history. Since his election to the U.S. House in 1991, he has caucused 
with the Democratic Party, which has entitled him to committee assignments 
and at times given Democrats a majority. Sanders became the ranking minority 
member on the Senate Budget Committee in January 2015; he had previously 
served for two years as chair of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. 
Sanders' campaign against Hillary Clinton for the party's 2016 U.S. presidential 
nomination raised more money in small, individual contributions than any 
other in American history, and helped Sanders to rise to international 
recognition. This was the only time in Sanders' career that he publicly 
identified as a Democrat, and he has since announced he will return to 
the Senate as an independent.[1] A self-described democratic socialist, 
Sanders is pro-labor and emphasizes reversing economic inequality.[2][3] 
Many scholars consider his views to be more in line with social democracy 
and New Deal-era American progressivism than democratic socialism.[4][5] 
Sanders was born and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York and graduated 
from the University of Chicago in 1964. While a student he was an active 
civil rights protest organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality and 
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. After settling in Vermont 
in 1968, Sanders ran unsuccessful third-party campaigns for governor and 
U.S. senator in the early to mid-1970s. As an independent, he was elected 
mayor of Burlington—Vermont's most populous city—in 1981, where he was 
reelected three times. In 1990 he was elected to represent Vermont's at-large 
congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he co-founded 
the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 1991. He served as a congressman 
for 16 years before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006. In 2012, 
he was re-elected with 71% of the popular vote. Polls indicate that he 
is among the senators most popular with their constituents, ranking third 
in 2014 and first in both 2015 and 2016.[6][7][8] Sanders rose to national 
prominence following his 2010 filibuster against the Middle Class Tax Relief 
Act of 2010, which extended the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. 
By favoring policies based largely on the Nordic model of social democracy 
and Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, Sanders has built a reputation as 
a leading progressive voice on issues such as campaign finance reform, 
corporate welfare, global warming, income inequality, LGBT rights, parental 
leave, and universal healthcare. Sanders has long been critical of U.S. 
foreign policy and was an early and outspoken opponent of the Iraq War, 
the First Gulf War, and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua. He is 
also outspoken on civil liberties and civil rights, particularly criticizing 
racial discrimination in the criminal justice system as well as advocating 
for privacy rights against mass surveillance policies such as the USA PATRIOT 
Act and the NSA surveillance programs. Sanders announced his campaign for 
the Democratic presidential nomination on April 30, 2015. He became the 
first Jewish American to win a Presidential primary contest when he defeated 
eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire on February 9, 2016. 
Initially considered a long shot, Sanders won 23 primaries and caucuses 
and approximately 43% of pledged delegates to Clinton's 55%. His campaign 
was noted for the enthusiasm of its supporters, as well as his rejection 
of large donations from corporations, the financial industry, and any associated 
Super PAC. The campaign instead relied on a record-breaking number of small, 
individual contributions. On July 12, 2016, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton 
against her U.S. Republican general election opponent Donald Trump, while 
urging his supporters to continue the "political revolution" his campaign 
had begun. He has started a successor 501(c)4 organization, Our Revolution, 
to recruit and support candidates for local, state, and national office. 
He has also announced the upcoming creation of The Sanders Institute, which 
will promote his policy agenda through documentary films and other media.[9] 
Bernard Sanders was born on September 8, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York City.[10][11][12][13] 
His father, Elias Sanders, was born on September 14, 1904 in Słopnice, 
Poland (then the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia),[14][15] to a Jewish 
family; in 1921, Elias immigrated to the United States at age 17.[14][16][17] 
His mother, Dorothy Sanders (née Glassberg), was born in New York City 
on October 2, 1912,[18][19] to Jewish immigrant parents from Poland and 
Russia.[20][21] Many of Elias's relatives back in Poland were killed in 
the Holocaust.[19][22][23] Sanders became interested in politics at an 
early age: "A guy named Adolf Hitler won an election in 1932. He won an 
election, and 50 million people died as a result of that election in World 
War II, including 6 million Jews. So what I learned as a little kid is 
that politics is, in fact, very important."[24][25][26][nb 1] Sanders lived 
on East 26th Street in Midwood, Brooklyn.[29] He attended elementary school 
at P.S. 197 in Brooklyn, where he won a borough championship on the basketball 
team.[30][31] He attended Hebrew school in the afternoons, and celebrated 
his bar mitzvah in 1954.[32] Bernie's older brother, Larry, said that during 
Bernie's childhood, the family never lacked for food or clothing, but major 
purchases, "like curtains or a rug," were difficult to afford.[33] Sanders 
attended James Madison High School, also in Brooklyn, where he was captain 
of the track team and took third place in the New York City indoor one-mile 
race.[30] In high school, Sanders lost his first election, finishing last 
out of three candidates for the student body presidency. Not long after 
his high school graduation, his mother died at the age of 46;[19][23] his 
father died a few years later on August 4, 1962, at the age of 57.[15] 
Sanders studied at Brooklyn College for a year in 1959–60[34] before transferring 
to the University of Chicago and graduating with a bachelor of arts degree 
in political science in 1964.[34] He has described himself as a mediocre 
college student because the classroom was "boring and irrelevant," while 
the community provided his most significant learning.[35] While at the 
University of Chicago, Sanders joined the Young People's Socialist League 
(the youth affiliate of the Socialist Party of America),[37] and was active 
in the Civil Rights Movement as a student organizer for the Congress of 
Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.[22][38] 
Under Sanders's chairmanship, the university chapter of CORE merged with 
the university chapter of SNCC.[39] In January 1962, Sanders led a rally 
at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university 
president George Wells Beadle's segregated campus housing policy. "We feel 
it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university 
cannot live together in university-owned apartments," Sanders said at the 
protest. Sanders and 32 other students then entered the building and camped 
outside the president's office, performing the first civil rights sit-in 
in Chicago history.[40][41] After weeks of sit-ins, Beadle and the university 
formed a commission to investigate discrimination.[42] Joan Mahoney, a 
member of the University of Chicago CORE chapter at the time and a fellow 
participant in the sit-ins, described Sanders in a 2016 interview as "...a 
swell guy, a nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn, but he wasn’t terribly charismatic. 
One of his strengths, though, was his ability to work with a wide group 
of people, even those he didn’t agree with".[43] Sanders once spent a day 
putting up fliers protesting against police brutality, only to eventually 
notice that a Chicago police car was shadowing him and taking them all 
down.[44] Sanders attended the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, 
where Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his "I Have a Dream" speech.[22][44][45] 
That summer, he was convicted of resisting arrest during a demonstration 
against segregation in Chicago's public schools and was fined $25.[36][46] 
In addition to his civil rights activism during the 1960s and 1970s,[47] 
Sanders was active in several peace and antiwar movements. He was a member 
of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Student Peace 
Union while attending the University of Chicago. Sanders applied for conscientious 
objector status during the Vietnam War; his application was eventually 
turned down, by which point he was too old to be drafted. Although he opposed 
the war, Sanders never criticized those who fought and has been a strong 
supporter of veterans' benefits.[48][49] After graduating from college, 
Sanders returned to New York City, where he initially worked at a variety 
of jobs, including Head Start teacher, psychiatric aide, and carpenter.[35] 
In 1968, Sanders moved to Vermont because he had been "captivated by rural 
life." After his arrival there he worked as a carpenter,[37] filmmaker, 
and writer[50] who created and sold "radical film strips" and other educational 
materials to schools.[51] He also wrote several articles for the alternative 
publication The Vermont Freeman.[52] Sanders began his electoral political 
career in 1971 as a member of the Liberty Union Party, which originated 
in the anti-war movement and the People's Party. He ran as the Liberty 
Union candidate for governor of Vermont in 1972 and 1976 and as a candidate 
for U.S. senator in 1972 and 1974.[53] In the 1974 senatorial race, Sanders 
finished third (5,901 votes; 4.1%), behind 33-year-old Chittenden County 
State's Attorney Patrick Leahy (D, VI; 70,629 votes; 49.4%) and two-term 
incumbent U.S. Representative Dick Mallary (R; 66,223 votes; 46.3%).[54][55] 
The 1976 campaign proved to be the zenith of Liberty Union's influence, 
with Sanders collecting 11,000 votes for governor and the party. This forced 
the races for lieutenant governor and secretary of state to be decided 
by the state legislature when its vote total prevented either the Republican 
or Democratic candidates for those offices from garnering a majority of 
votes.[56] The campaign drained the finances and energy of the Liberty 
Union, however, and in October 1977—less than a year after the conclusion 
of the 1976 campaign—Sanders and the Liberty Union candidate for attorney 
general, Nancy Kaufman, announced their retirement from the party.[57] 
Following his resignation from Liberty Union, Sanders worked as a writer 
and the director of the nonprofit American People's Historical Society 
(APHS).[58] While with the APHS, he made a 30-minute documentary about 
American Socialist leader and presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs.[37][59] 
In 1980, at the suggestion of his close friend and political confidante 
Richard Sugarman, a professor of religion at the University of Vermont, 
Sanders ran for mayor of Burlington, Vermont (pop. 38,000). The 39-year-old 
Sanders ran against incumbent Democratic mayor Gordon "Gordie" Paquette, 
a five-term mayor who had served as a member of the Burlington City Council 
for 13 years before that, building extensive community ties and a willingness 
to cooperate with Republican leaders in controlling appointments to various 
commissions.[60] Republicans had found Paquette so unobjectionable that 
they failed to field a candidate in the March 1981 race against him, leaving 
Sanders as his principal opponent.[61] Sanders' effort was further aided 
by the decision of the candidate of the Citizens Party, Greg Guma, to exit 
the race so as not to split the progressive vote.[62] Two other candidates 
in the race, independents Richard Bove and Joe McGrath, proved to be essentially 
non-factors in the campaign, with the battle coming down to Paquette and 
Sanders.[63] Sanders castigated the pro-development incumbent as an ally 
of prominent shopping center developer Antonio Pomerleau, while Paquette 
warned of ruin for Burlington if Sanders was elected.[64] The Sanders campaign 
was bolstered by a wave of optimistic volunteers as well as by a series 
of endorsements from university professors, social welfare agencies, and 
the police union.[65] The final result came as a shock to the local political 
establishment, with the maverick Sanders winning by just 10 votes.[66] 
Sanders was reelected three times, defeating both Democratic and Republican 
candidates. He received 53% of the vote in 1983 and 55% in 1985.[67] In 
his final run for mayor in 1987, Sanders defeated Paul Lafayette, a Democrat 
endorsed by both major parties.[68] During his mayoralty, Sanders called 
himself a socialist and was so described in the press.[69][70] During his 
first term, his supporters, including the first Citizens Party City Councilor 
Terry Bouricius, formed the Progressive Coalition, the forerunner of the 
Vermont Progressive Party.[71] The Progressives never held more than six 
seats on the 13-member city council, but they had enough to keep the council 
from overriding Sanders's vetoes. Under Sanders, Burlington became the 
first city in the country to fund community-trust housing.[72] During the 
1980s, Sanders was a staunch critic of U.S. foreign policy in Latin America.[73] 
In 1985, Burlington City Hall hosted a foreign policy speech by Noam Chomsky. 
In his introduction, Sanders praised Chomsky as "a very vocal and important 
voice in the wilderness of intellectual life in America" and said he was 
"delighted to welcome a person who I think we're all very proud of."[74][75] 
Sanders' administration balanced the city budget and drew a minor league 
baseball team, the Vermont Reds, then the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati 
Reds, to Burlington.[19] Under his leadership, Burlington sued the local 
television cable franchise, winning reduced rates for customers.[19] As 
mayor, Sanders led extensive downtown revitalization projects. One of his 
signature achievements was the improvement of Burlington's Lake Champlain 
waterfront.[19] In 1981, Sanders campaigned against the unpopular plans 
by Burlington developer Tony Pomerleau to convert the then-industrial[76] 
waterfront property owned by the Central Vermont Railway into expensive 
condominiums, hotels, and offices.[77] Sanders ran under the slogan "Burlington 
is not for sale" and successfully supported a plan that redeveloped the 
waterfront area into a mixed-use district featuring housing, parks, and 
public space.[77] Today, the waterfront area includes many parks and miles 
of public beach and bike paths, a boathouse, and a science center.[77] 
Sanders hosted and produced a public-access television program, Bernie 
Speaks with the Community, from 1986 to 1988.[78][79] He collaborated with 
30 Vermont musicians to record a folk album, We Shall Overcome, in 1987.[80][81] 
In 1986, Sanders unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Governor Madeleine 
Kunin (D) in her run for reelection. Running as an independent, Sanders 
finished in 3rd place with 14.4% of the vote. Kunin won with 47%, followed 
by Lt. Governor Peter P. Smith (R) with 38%. In 1987, U.S. News & World 
Report ranked Sanders as one of America's best mayors.[82] As of 2013[update], 
Burlington was regarded as one of the most livable cities in the nation.[83][84] 
After serving four two-year terms, Sanders chose not to seek reelection 
in 1989. He lectured in political science at Harvard University's Kennedy 
School of Government that year and at Hamilton College in 1991.[85] Sanders' 
1990 victory was heralded by The Washington Post and others as the "First 
Socialist Elected" to the United States House of Representatives in decades.[86][87] 
Sanders served in the House from 1991 until he became a senator in 2007. 
In 1988, incumbent Republican Congressman Jim Jeffords decided to run for 
the U.S. Senate, vacating the House seat representing Vermont's at-large 
congressional district. Former Lieutenant Governor Peter P. Smith (R) won 
the House election with a plurality, securing 41% of the vote. Sanders, 
who ran as an independent, placed second with 38% of the vote, while Democratic 
State Representative Paul N. Poirier placed third with 19% of the vote.[88] 
Two years later, Sanders ran for the seat again and defeated the incumbent 
Smith by a margin of 56% to 39%.[89] Sanders was the first independent 
elected to the U.S. House of Representatives since Frazier Reams' election 
to represent Ohio 40 years earlier.[87] He served as a representative for 
16 years, winning reelection by large margins except during the 1994 Republican 
Revolution, when he won by 3.3%, with 49.8% of the vote.[90] During his 
first year in the House, Sanders often alienated allies and colleagues 
with his criticism of both political parties as working primarily on behalf 
of the wealthy. In 1991, Sanders co-founded the Congressional Progressive 
Caucus, a group of mostly liberal Democrats that Sanders chaired for its 
first eight years,[19] while still refusing to join the Democratic Party 
or caucus.[91] In 1993, Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, which mandated 
federal background checks and imposed a waiting period on firearm purchasers 
in the United States; the bill passed by a vote of 238–187.[92][93] In 
1994, Sanders voted in favor of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement 
Act. Sanders said he voted for the bill "because it included the Violence 
Against Women Act and the ban on certain assault weapons". He was nevertheless 
extremely critical of the other parts of the bill.[94][95] Though he acknowledged 
that "clearly, there are some people in our society who are horribly violent, 
who are deeply sick and sociopathic, and clearly these people must be put 
behind bars in order to protect society from them", he maintained in his 
intervention before the House that the government's ill-thought policies 
played a large part in "dooming tens of millions of young people to a future 
of bitterness, misery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence". In this 
same intervention, he argued that the repressive policies introduced by 
the bill were not addressing the causes of violence, stating that "we can 
create meaningful jobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails".[96] 
In 2005, he voted for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.[97] 
The act's purpose was to prevent firearms manufacturers and dealers from 
being held liable for negligence when crimes have been committed with their 
products. In 2015, Sanders defended his vote, saying: "If somebody has 
a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and the murderer kills 
somebody with a gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible? Not 
any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats 
somebody over the head with a hammer."[98] Sanders voted against the resolutions 
authorizing the use of force against Iraq in 1991 and 2002, and opposed 
the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He voted for the 2001 Authorization for Use 
of Military Force Against Terrorists[99] that has been cited as the legal 
justification for controversial military actions since the September 11 
attacks.[100] Sanders voted for a non-binding resolution expressing support 
for troops at the outset of the invasion of Iraq, but gave a floor speech 
criticizing the partisan nature of the vote and the George W. Bush administration's 
actions in the run-up to the war. Regarding the investigation of what turned 
out to be a leak of CIA agent Valerie Plame's identity by a State Department 
official, Sanders stated: "The revelation that the President authorized 
the release of classified information in order to discredit an Iraq war 
critic should tell every member of Congress that the time is now for a 
serious investigation of how we got into the war in Iraq and why Congress 
can no longer act as a rubber stamp for the President."[101] Sanders was 
a consistent critic of the Patriot Act.[102] As a member of Congress, he 
voted against the original Patriot Act legislation.[103] After its 357-to-66 
passage in the House, Sanders sponsored and voted for several subsequent 
amendments and acts attempting to curtail its effects,[104] and voted against 
each re-authorization.[105] In June 2005, Sanders proposed an amendment 
to limit Patriot Act provisions that allow the government to obtain individuals' 
library and book-buying records. The amendment passed the House by a bipartisan 
majority, but was removed on November 4 of that year in House-Senate negotiations 
and never became law.[106] In March 2006, after a series of resolutions 
passed in various Vermont towns calling for him to bring articles of impeachment 
against George W. Bush, Sanders stated that it would be "impractical to 
talk about impeachment" with Republicans in control of the House and Senate.[107] 
Still, Sanders made no secret of his opposition to the Bush Administration, 
which he regularly criticized for its cuts to social programs.[108][109][110] 
Sanders was a vocal critic of Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan; in 
June 2003, during a question-and-answer discussion with the then-Chairman, 
Sanders told Greenspan that he was concerned that Greenspan was "way out 
of touch" and "that you see your major function in your position as the 
need to represent the wealthy and large corporations".[111][112] In October 
2008, after Sanders had been elected to the Senate, Greenspan admitted 
to Congress that his economic ideology regarding risky mortgage loans was 
flawed.[113][114] In 1998, Sanders voted and advocated against rolling 
back the Glass–Steagall Legislation provisions that kept investment banks 
and commercial banks separate entities.[115] On November 2, 2005, Sanders 
voted against the Online Freedom of Speech Act, which would have exempted 
the Internet from the campaign finance restrictions of the McCain–Feingold 
Bill.[116] Sanders entered the race for the U.S. Senate on April 21, 2005, 
after Senator Jim Jeffords announced that he would not seek a fourth term. 
Chuck Schumer, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, 
endorsed Sanders, a critical move as it meant that no Democrat running 
against Sanders could expect to receive financial help from the party. 
Sanders was also endorsed by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada 
and Democratic National Committee chairman and former Vermont governor 
Howard Dean. Dean said in May 2005 that he considered Sanders an ally who 
"votes with the Democrats 98% of the time".[117] Then-Senator Barack Obama 
also campaigned for Sanders in Vermont in March 2006.[118] Sanders entered 
into an agreement with the Democratic Party, much as he had as a congressman, 
to be listed in their primary but to decline the nomination should he win, 
which he did.[119][120] In the most expensive political campaign in Vermont's 
history,[121] Sanders defeated businessman Rich Tarrant by an approximately 
2-to-1 margin. Many national media outlets projected Sanders as the winner 
just after the polls closed, before any returns came in. He was reelected 
in 2012 with 71% of the vote.[122] Sanders was only the third senator from 
Vermont to caucus with the Democrats, after Jeffords and Leahy. His caucusing 
with the Democrats gave them a 51–49 majority in the Senate during the 
110th Congress in 2007–08. The Democrats needed 51 seats to control the 
Senate because Vice President Dick Cheney would have broken any tie in 
favor of the Republicans.[123] When he officially announced his intention 
to seek the Democratic nomination for president, Sanders set himself on 
a path to become only the second Democrat to represent Vermont in the Senate, 
the other being Leahy.[citation needed] Polling conducted in August 2011 
by Public Policy Polling found that Sanders's approval rating was 67% and 
his disapproval rating 28%, making him then the third-most popular senator 
in the country.[7] Both the NAACP and the NHLA have given Sanders 100% 
voting scores during his tenure in the Senate.[124] In 2015 Sanders was 
named one of the Top 5 of The Forward 50.[125] In a November 2015 Morning 
Consult poll, Sanders had an approval rating of 83% among his constituents, 
making him the most popular senator in the country.[6] As an independent, 
Sanders worked out a deal with the Senate Democratic leadership in which 
he agreed to vote with the Democrats on all procedural matters, except 
with permission from Democratic whip Dick Durbin (a request that is rarely 
made or granted). In return, he was allowed to keep his seniority and received 
the committee seats that would have been available to him as a Democrat; 
in 2013–14, he was chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' 
Affairs (during the Veterans Health Administration scandal).[126][127] 
Sanders was free to vote as he pleased on policy matters, but almost always 
voted with the Democrats.[citation needed] On September 24, 2008, Sanders 
posted an open letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson decrying the 
initial bank bailout proposal; it drew more than 8,000 citizen cosigners 
in 24 hours.[128] On January 26, 2009, Sanders and Democrats Robert Byrd, 
Russ Feingold, and Tom Harkin were the sole majority members to vote against 
confirming Timothy Geithner as United States Secretary of the Treasury.[129] 
On December 10, 2010, Sanders delivered an 8 1⁄2-hour speech against the 
Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act 
of 2010, the proposed extension of the Bush-era tax rates that eventually 
became law, saying "Enough is enough! ... How many homes can you own?"[130][131][132] 
In response to the speech, hundreds of people signed online petitions urging 
Sanders to run in the 2012 presidential election, and pollsters began measuring 
his support in key primary states.[133] Progressive activists such as Rabbi 
Michael Lerner and economist David Korten publicly voiced their support 
for a prospective Sanders run against President Barack Obama.[133] Sanders's 
speech was published in February 2011 by Nation Books as The Speech: A 
Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of Our Middle Class, 
with authorial proceeds going to Vermont nonprofit charitable organizations.[134] 
In January 2015, Sanders became the ranking minority member of the Senate 
Budget Committee.[127] He appointed economics professor Stephanie Kelton, 
a modern monetary theory scholar and self-described "deficit owl", as the 
chief economic adviser for the committee's Democratic minority[135] and 
presented a report aimed at helping "rebuild the disappearing middle class", 
which included proposals to raise the minimum wage, boost infrastructure 
spending, and increase Social Security payments.[136] Sanders announced 
his intention to seek the Democratic Party's nomination for president on 
April 30, 2015, in an address on the Capitol lawn.[137][138][139] His campaign 
was officially launched on May 26, 2015, in Burlington.[138] In his announcement, 
Sanders said, "I don't believe that the men and women who defended American 
democracy fought to create a situation where billionaires own the political 
process," and made this a central idea throughout his campaign.[137][138] 
Senator Elizabeth Warren welcomed Sanders's entry into the race, saying, 
"I'm glad to see him get out there and give his version of what leadership 
in this country should be."[140] On June 19, 2015, the "Ready For Warren" 
organization, which had unsuccessfully tried to draft Warren to run for 
president, endorsed Sanders and re-branded itself "Ready to Fight".[141] 
Unlike the other major candidates, Sanders stated that he would not pursue 
funding through a Super PAC, instead focusing on small individual donations.[142] 
His presidential campaign raised $1.5 million within 24 hours of his official 
announcement.[143] At year's end the campaign had raised a total of $73 
million from more than one million people making 2.5 million donations, 
with an average donation of $27.16.[144] The campaign reached 3.25 million 
donations by the end of January 2016, raising $20 million in that month 
alone.[145] Sanders used social media to help his campaign gain momentum,[146] 
posting content to online platforms such as Twitter and Facebook and answering 
questions on Reddit. He gained a large grassroots organizational following 
online. A July 29, 2015, meetup organized online brought 100,000 supporters 
to more than 3,500 simultaneous events nationwide.[147] Sanders' campaign 
events in June 2015 drew overflow crowds around the country, to his surprise.[148][149][150] 
When Hillary Clinton and Sanders made public appearances within days of 
each other in Des Moines, Iowa, Sanders drew larger crowds, even though 
he had already made numerous stops around the state and Clinton's visit 
was her first in 2015.[151] On July 1, 2015, Sanders's campaign stop in 
Madison, Wisconsin, drew the largest crowd of any 2016 presidential candidate 
to that date, with an estimated turnout of 10,000.[152][153] Over the following 
weeks he gained even larger crowds: 11,000 in Arizona,[154] 15,000 in Seattle,[155] 
and 28,000 in Portland.[156] A NBC/Wall Street Journal poll conducted in 
May found Clinton and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump in a 
"dead heat", but the same poll found that if Sanders were the Democratic 
nominee, 53% of voters would support him to 39% for Trump.[157] Clinton 
and Trump were the least popular likely candidates in the poll's history, 
while Sanders received a 43% positive, 36% negative rating.[158] Polls 
showed that Democratic voters older than 50 preferred Clinton by a large 
margin but those under 50 overwhelmingly favored Sanders.[159] After the 
last primary election (the District of Columbia's, on June 14), Clinton 
became the presumptive Democratic nominee.[160] Sanders met with her on 
June 16 and issued a press release reading “Senator Sanders and Secretary 
Clinton met in Washington on Tuesday evening and had a positive discussion 
about how best to bring more people into the political process and about 
the dangerous threat that Donald Trump poses to our nation. Sanders congratulated 
Secretary Clinton on the campaign she has run and said he appreciated her 
strong commitment to stopping Trump in the general election." That evening 
Sanders gave a live online speech to his supporters, saying, "The political 
revolution continues".[161] On July 12, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton 
at a rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,[162] but he continued to work 
with the Democratic National Convention organizers to implement the progressive 
positions he had been campaigning for. Speaking at the Democratic National 
Convention on July 25, Sanders gave Clinton his full support, saying, "Any 
objective observer will conclude that — based on her ideas and her leadership 
— Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States."[163] 
On October 28, 2016, Sanders was declared an eligible write-in candidate 
for president in California, with Tulsi Gabbard as the vice-presidential 
running mate.[164] The 2016 Democratic Party presidential debates occur 
among candidates in the campaign for the Democratic Party's nomination 
for the President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election. 
The DNC announced in May 2015 that there would be six debates, which was 
later increased to ten.[165][166] Two debates took place on a Saturday, 
two on Sunday, three on a Thursday, one on a Tuesday and one on a Wednesday.[166] 
Critics, including the Sanders campaign, alleged that the debate schedule 
was part of the DNC's deliberate attempt to protect the front-runner, Hillary 
Clinton.[167] Clinton expressed willingness to hold more debates.[168] 
On February 3, 2016, just ahead of the second New Hampshire debate, Clinton's 
and Sanders' campaigns agreed in principle to holding four more debates, 
also sanctioned by the DNC, for a total of ten.[169] The tenth debate was 
not held, however.[170] In November 2015, Sanders announced that he would 
be a Democrat from then on, and will run in any future elections as a Democrat.[171][172][173] 
On February 4, 2016, Sanders said, "Of course I am a Democrat and running 
for the Democratic nomination."[174] In 2016, many additional sources, 
such as PBS,[175] The Wall Street Journal,[176] and CBS News[177] described 
Sanders as a Democrat. The United States Senate website includes pages 
that refer to Sanders as an independent[178] as well as pages that refer 
to him as a Democrat. Some of the pages calling him a Democrat are dated 
before 2015, possibly in error or in reference to his caucusing with the 
Democrats, not his later-declared affiliation.[179] In 2016, his official 
Senate press releases still referred to him as an independent,[180][181] 
or omitted party affiliation.[182] Following his presidential campaign, 
Sanders returned to the Senate as an independent.[183] In August 2016, 
Sanders founded Our Revolution, an organization dedicated to educating 
voters about political issues, getting people involved in the political 
process, and recruiting and supporting candidates for local, state, and 
national office.[9] “Election days come and go, but the struggle for economic, 
social, racial and environmental justice must continue. We have the guts 
and the energy to take on the special interests, win critical battles on 
the most important issues of our time, and redefine what’s possible in 
this country. Now it’s time for all of us to get to work."[184] Sanders 
also plans to establish The Sanders Institute, which will focus on issues 
he believes the "corporate media" has failed to focus on. The agenda will 
include "the disappearing middle class, 'massive' income inequality, horrific 
levels of poverty and problems affecting seniors and children."[9] Former 
Sanders presidential campaign staffers have also formed a political organization, 
Brand New Congress, to elect Congressional representatives in line with 
the campaign's political platform. Our Revolution is also the title of 
a book by Sanders to be released in November 2016.[185][186] Progressive 
Era Repression and persecution Civil Rights / anti-War movements Sanders 
is a self-described socialist,[187][188] democratic socialist,[193] and 
progressive who admires the Nordic model of social democracy and is a proponent 
of workplace democracy.[194][190][195] In November 2015, Sanders gave a 
speech at Georgetown University about his view of democratic socialism, 
including its place in the policies of presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt 
and Lyndon B. Johnson.[196][197] In defining what democratic socialism 
means to him, Sanders said: "I don’t believe government should take over 
the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, but I 
do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the 
wealth of America deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes 
should go up, not down. I do believe in private companies that thrive and 
invest and grow in America, companies that create jobs here, rather than 
companies that are shutting down in America and increasing their profits 
by exploiting low-wage labor abroad."[196] Noam Chomsky described Sanders 
as "basically a New Dealer,"[5][198] and many journalists have likened 
his policies to the New Deal. Political Compass, which is based on the 
British political spectrum, scores Sanders' positions as center-left as 
of the 2016 presidential election cycle.[199] Many commentators have noted 
the consistency of Sanders's views throughout his political career.[200][201] 
Calling international trade agreements a "disaster for the American worker", 
Sanders voted against and has spoken for years against NAFTA, CAFTA, and 
PNTR with China, saying that they have resulted in American corporations 
moving abroad. He also strongly opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, 
which he says was "written by corporate America and the pharmaceutical 
industry and Wall Street."[202][203] Sanders focuses on economic issues 
such as income and wealth inequality,[189][204] raising the minimum wage,[205] 
universal healthcare,[206] reducing the burden of student debt,[207] making 
public colleges and universities tuition-free by taxing financial transactions,[208] 
and expanding Social Security benefits by eliminating the cap on the payroll 
tax on all incomes above $250,000.[209][210] He has become a prominent 
supporter of laws requiring companies to give their workers parental leave, 
sick leave, and vacation time, noting that such laws have been adopted 
by nearly all other developed countries.[211] He also supports legislation 
that would make it easier for workers to join or form a trade union.[212][213] 
Sanders advocates bold action to reverse global warming and substantial 
investment in infrastructure, with "energy efficiency and sustainability" 
and job creation as prominent goals.[214][215] He considers climate change 
the greatest threat to national security.[216][217] Sanders opposes the 
construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on the grounds that, like the 
Keystone XL Pipeline, it "will have a significant impact on our climate."[218] 
Sanders has advocated greater democratic participation by citizens, campaign 
finance reform, and a constitutional amendment or judicial decision that 
would overturn Citizens United v. FEC.[219][220][221] He calls for comprehensive 
financial reforms,[222] such as breaking up "too big to fail" financial 
institutions, restoring Glass–Steagall legislation, reforming the Federal 
Reserve Bank and allowing the Post Office to offer basic financial services 
in economically marginalized communities.[227] Sanders strongly opposed 
the U.S. invasion of Iraq and has criticized a number of policies instituted 
during the War on Terror, particularly mass surveillance and the USA PATRIOT 
Act.[228][229][230] Sanders has liberal stances on social issues, having 
advocated for LGBT rights and against the Defense of Marriage Act.[231] 
He considers himself a feminist,[232] is pro-choice on abortion, and opposes 
the de-funding of Planned Parenthood.[233] Sanders has denounced institutional 
racism and called for criminal justice reform to reduce the number of people 
in prison,[234] advocates a crackdown on police brutality, and supports 
abolishing private, for-profit prisons[235][236][237] and the death penalty.[238] 
Sanders supports Black Lives Matter.[239] Sanders supports legalizing marijuana 
at the federal level.[240] On November 15, 2015, in response to the Islamic 
State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)'s attacks in Paris, Sanders cautioned 
against "Islamophobia" and said, "We gotta be tough, not stupid" in the 
war against ISIL, further stating that the U.S. should continue to welcome 
Syrian refugees.[241] Sanders contends that, following Trump's victory 
in the 2016 elections, the Democratic Party needs a "series of reforms" 
and "must break loose from its corporate establishment ties and, once again, 
become a grass-roots party of working people, the elderly and the poor."[242] 
In 1963, Sanders and Deborah Shiling, whom he met in college, volunteered 
for several months on the Israeli kibbutz Sha'ar HaAmakim. They married 
in 1964 and bought a summer home in Vermont; they had no children and divorced 
in 1966.[37][243][244] Sanders's son, Levi Sanders, was born in 1969 to 
girlfriend Susan Campbell Mott.[35] In 1988, Sanders married Jane O'Meara 
Driscoll (née Mary Jane O'Meara), who later became president of Burlington 
College, in Burlington, Vermont.[245] The day after their wedding, the 
couple visited the Soviet Union as part of an official delegation in his 
capacity as mayor, a trip he ironically called a honeymoon.[246] Sanders 
considers Jane's three children — Dave Driscoll, Carina Driscoll, and Heather 
Titus (née Driscoll) — to be his own.[37][247] He also has seven grandchildren.[248] 
In December 1987, during his tenure as mayor, Sanders recorded a folk album 
titled We Shall Overcome with 30 Vermont musicians. As Sanders was not 
skilled at singing, he performed his vocals in a talking blues style.[249][250] 
Sanders appeared in a cameo role in the 1988 comedy-drama film Sweet Hearts 
Dance, playing a man who distributes candy to young trick-or-treaters.[251] 
In 1999, he acted in the film My X-Girlfriend's Wedding Reception, playing 
the role of Rabbi Manny Shevitz. In this role he mourned the Brooklyn Dodgers 
moving to Los Angeles, reflecting Sanders's own upbringing in Brooklyn.[252] 
On February 6, 2016, Sanders was a guest star alongside Larry David on 
Saturday Night Live, playing a Polish immigrant on a steamship that was 
sinking near the Statue of Liberty.[253] On December 4, 2015, Sanders won 
Time's 2015 Person of the Year readers' poll with 10.2% of the vote[254][255] 
but did not receive the editorial board's award.[256] Sanders's elder brother, 
Larry, lives in England.[257] He was a Green Party county councillor, representing 
the East Oxford division on Oxfordshire County Council, until he retired 
from the Council in 2013.[258][259] Larry ran as a Green Party candidate 
for Oxford West and Abingdon in the 2015 British general election and came 
in fifth.[260][261] Bernie told CNN, "I owe my brother an enormous amount. 
It was my brother who actually introduced me to a lot of my ideas."[261] 
Sanders had a typical upbringing for his generation of American Jews: his 
father generally attended synagogue only on Yom Kippur; he attended public 
schools while his mother "chafed" at his yeshiva Sunday schooling at a 
Hebrew school; and their religious observances were mostly limited to Passover 
seders with their neighbors. Larry Sanders said, "They were very pleased 
to be Jews, but didn’t have a strong belief in God."[262] Bernie had a 
bar mitzvah[263] at the historic Kingsway Jewish Center in Midwood, Brooklyn, 
where he grew up.[262] In 1963, in cooperation with the Labor Zionist youth 
movement Hashomer Hatzair, Sanders and his first wife volunteered at Sha’ar 
HaAmakim, a kibbutz in northern Israel.[264][265][266][267] His motivation 
for the trip was as much socialistic as it was Zionistic.[262] As mayor 
of Burlington, Sanders allowed a Chabad public menorah to be placed at 
city hall, an action contested by the local ACLU chapter. He publicly inaugurated 
the Hanukkah menorah and performed the Jewish religious ritual of blessing 
Hanukkah candles.[262] His early and strong support played a significant 
role in the now widespread public menorah celebrations around the globe.[268][269][270][271] 
When asked about his Jewish heritage, Sanders has said he is "proud to 
be Jewish".[25][267] Sanders rarely speaks about religion.[263] He describes 
himself as "not particularly religious"[25] and "not actively involved" 
with organized religion.[263] A press package issued by his office states 
"Religion: Jewish".[272] He has said he believes in God, though not necessarily 
in a traditional manner: "I think everyone believes in God in their own 
ways," he said. "To me, it means that all of us are connected, all of life 
is connected, and that we are all tied together."[263][273] In October 
2015, on the late-night talk show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Kimmel asked Bernie, 
"You say you are culturally Jewish and you don't feel religious; do you 
believe in God and do you think that's important to the people of the United 
States?" Bernie replied:[274] I am who I am, and what I believe in and 
what my spirituality is about is that we're all in this together. That 
I think it is not a good thing to believe as human beings we can turn our 
backs on the suffering of other people ... and this is not Judaism, this 
is what Pope Francis is talking about, that we can't just worship billionaires 
and the making of more and more money. Life is more than that. In 2016, 
he stated he had "very strong religious and spiritual feelings" and explained, 
"My spirituality is that we are all in this together and that when children 
go hungry, when veterans sleep out on the street, it impacts me."[275] 
Sanders does not regularly attend any synagogue, and he works on Rosh Hashanah, 
a day when Jews typically take a holiday from work. He has attended yahrzeit 
observances in memory of the deceased, for the father of a friend, and 
attended a Tashlikh, an atonement ceremony, with the mayor of Lynchburg 
on the afternoon of Rosh Hashanah in 2015.[262] According to Sanders's 
close friend Richard Sugarman, a professor of religious studies at the 
University of Vermont, Sanders's Jewish identity is "certainly more ethnic 
and cultural than religious".[276] Deborah Dash Moore, a Judaic scholar 
at the University of Michigan, has said that Sanders has a particular type 
of "ethnic Jewishness" that is somewhat old-fashioned.[277] Sanders's wife 
is Roman Catholic, and he has frequently expressed admiration for Pope 
Francis, saying that "the leader of the Catholic Church is raising profound 
issues. It is important that we listen to what he has said." Sanders has 
said he feels "very close" to Francis' economic teachings, describing him 
as "incredibly smart and brave".[18][278][279] In April 2016, Sanders accepted 
an invitation from Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, an aide close to the pope, 
to speak at a Vatican conference on economic and environmental issues.
