London is a city located in Southwestern Ontario, Canada along the Quebec 
City–Windsor Corridor. The city has a population of 366,151 according to 
the 2011 Canadian census. London is at the confluence of the non-navigable 
Thames River, approximately halfway between Toronto, Ontario and Detroit, 
Michigan. The City of London is a separated municipality, politically separate 
from Middlesex County, though it remains the county seat. London and the 
Thames were named in 1793 by John Graves Simcoe, who proposed the site 
for the capital of Upper Canada. The first European settlement was between 
1801 and 1804 by Peter Hagerman.[4] The village was founded in 1826 and 
incorporated in 1855. Since then, London has grown to be the largest Southwestern 
Ontario municipality and Canada's 11th largest municipality, having annexed 
many of the smaller communities that surrounded it. London is a regional 
centre of health care and education, being home to the University of Western 
Ontario, Fanshawe College, and several hospitals. The city hosts a number 
of musical and artistic exhibits and festivals, which contribute to its 
tourism industry, but its economic activity is centred on education, medical 
research, insurance, and information technology. London's university and 
hospitals are among its top ten employers. London lies at the junction 
of Highway 401 and 402, connecting it to Toronto, Windsor, and Sarnia. 
It also has an international airport, train and bus station. Prior to European 
contact in the 18th century, the present site of London was occupied by 
several Neutral and Odawa/Ojibwa villages. Archaeological investigations 
in the region indicate that aboriginal people have resided in the area 
for at least the past 10,000 years.[5] The current location of London was 
selected as the site of the future capital of Upper Canada in 1793 by Lieutenant-Governor 
John Graves Simcoe. Simcoe intended to name the settlement Georgina,[6] 
in honour of King George III, and renamed the river. However, the choice 
of a capital site in the midst of extensive hardwood forests was rejected 
by Guy Carleton (Governor Dorchester).[7] In 1814, there was a skirmish 
during the War of 1812 in what is now southwest London at Reservoir Hill, 
formerly Hungerford Hill.[8] The village of London, named after the English 
capital of London,[9] was not founded until 1826, and not as the capital 
Simcoe envisioned. Rather, it was an administrative seat for the area west 
of the actual capital, York (now Toronto). Locally, it was part of the 
Talbot Settlement, named for Colonel Thomas Talbot, the chief coloniser 
of the area, who oversaw the land surveying and built the first government 
buildings for the administration of the Western Ontario peninsular region. 
Together with the rest of Southwestern Ontario, the village benefited from 
Talbot's provisions, not only for building and maintaining roads, but also 
for assignment of access priorities to main routes to productive land.[10] 
At the time, Crown and clergy reserves were receiving preference in the 
rest of Ontario. In 1832, the new settlement suffered an outbreak of cholera.[11] 
London proved a centre of strong Tory support during the Upper Canada Rebellion 
of 1837, notwithstanding a brief rebellion led by Charles Duncombe. Consequently, 
the British government located its Ontario peninsular garrison there in 
1838, increasing its population with soldiers and their dependents, and 
the business support populations they required.[10] London was incorporated 
as a town in 1840.[11] On 13 April 1845, fire destroyed much of London, 
which was at the time largely constructed of wooden buildings.[12] One 
of the first casualties was the town's only fire engine. This fire burned 
nearly 30 acres of land destroying 150 buildings before burning itself 
out later the same day. One-fifth of London was destroyed and this was 
the province's first million dollar fire.[13] On 1 January 1855, London 
was incorporated as a "city" (10,000 or more residents).[10] In the 1860s, 
a sulphur spring was discovered at the forks of the Thames River while 
industrialists were drilling for oil.[14] The springs became a popular 
destination for wealthy Ontarians, until the turn of the 20th century when 
a textile factory was built at the site, replacing the spa. Long before 
the Royal Military College of Canada was established in 1876, there were 
proposals for military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, 
adult male students underwent a 3 month long military courses from 1865 
at the School of Military Instruction in London. Established by Militia 
General Order in 1865, the school enabled Officers of Militia or Candidates 
for Commission or promotion in the Militia to learn Military duties, drill 
and discipline, to command a Company at Battalion Drill, to Drill a Company 
at Company Drill, the internal economy of a Company and the duties of a 
Company's Officer.[15] The school was not retained at Confederation, in 
1867.[16] Sir John Carling, Tory MP for London, gave three events to explain 
the development of London in a 1901 speech. They were: the location of 
the court and administration in London in 1826; the arrival of the military 
garrison in 1838; and the arrival of the railway in 1853.[17] In 1875, 
London's first iron bridge, the Blackfriars Street Bridge, was constructed.[12] 
It replaced a succession of flood-failed wooden structures that had provided 
the city's only northern road crossing of the river. A rare example of 
a bowstring truss bridge, the Blackfriars remains open to pedestrian and 
bicycle traffic, though it is currently closed indefinitely to vehicular 
traffic due to various structural problems.[18] The Blackfriars, amidst 
the river-distance between the Carling Brewery and the historic Tecumseh 
Park (including a major mill), linked London with its western suburb of 
Petersville, named for Squire Peters of Grosvenor Lodge. That community 
joined with the southern subdivision of Kensington in 1874, formally incorporating 
as the municipality of Petersville. Although it changed its name in 1880 
to the more inclusive "London West", it remained a separate municipality 
until ratepayers voted for amalgamation with London in 1897,[10] largely 
due to repeated flooding. The most serious flood was that of July 1883, 
which resulted in serious loss of life and property devaluation.[19] This 
area retains much original and attractively maintained 19th-century tradespeople's 
and workers' housing, including Georgian cottages as well as larger houses, 
and a distinct sense of place. London's eastern suburb, London East, was 
(and remains) an industrial centre, which also incorporated in 1874.[10] 
Attaining the status of town in 1881,[20] it continued as a separate municipality 
until concerns over expensive waterworks and other fiscal problems led 
to amalgamation in 1885.[21] The southern suburb of London, including Wortley 
Village, was collectively known as "London South". Never incorporated, 
the South was annexed to the city in 1890,[10] although Wortley Village 
still retains a distinct sense of place. By contrast, the settlement at 
Broughdale on the city's north end had a clear identity, adjoined the university, 
and was not annexed until 1961.[22] On 24 May 1881, the ferry SS Victoria 
capsized in the Thames River, drowning approximately 200 passengers, the 
worst disaster in London's history. Two years later, on 12 July 1883,[12] 
the first of the two most devastating floods in London's history killed 
17 people. The second major flood, on 26 April 1937, destroyed more than 
a thousand houses and caused over $50 million in damages, particularly 
in West London.[23][24] After repeated floods the Upper Thames River Conservation 
Authority in 1953 built Fanshawe Dam on the North Thames to control the 
downstream rivers.[25] Financing for this project came from the federal, 
provincial, and municipal governments. Other natural disasters include 
a 1984 tornado that led to damage on several streets in the White Oaks 
area of South London.[26] London's role as a military centre continued 
into the 20th century during the two World Wars, serving as the administrative 
centre for the Western Ontario district. In 1905, the London Armoury was 
built and housed the First Hussars until 1975. A private investor purchased 
the historic site and built a new hotel (Delta London Armouries, 1996)in 
its place preserving the shell of the historic building. In the 1950s, 
two reserve battalions amalgamated and became London and Oxford Rifles 
(3rd Battalion), The Royal Canadian Regiment.[27] This unit continues to 
serve today as 4th Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment. The Regimental 
Headquarters of The Royal Canadian Regiment remains in London at Wolseley 
Barracks on Oxford Street. The barracks are home to the First Hussars militia 
regiment as well.[27] London annexed many of the surrounding communities 
in 1961, including Byron and Masonville, adding 60,000 people and more 
than doubling its area.[10] After this amalgamation, suburban growth accelerated 
as London grew outward in all directions, creating expansive new subdivisions 
such as Westmount, Oakridge, Whitehills, Pond Mills, White Oaks and Stoneybrook.[10] 
In 1992, London annexed nearly the entire township of Westminster, a large, 
primarily rural municipality directly south of the city, including the 
police village of Lambeth.[28] With this massive annexation, London almost 
doubled in area again, adding several thousand more residents. London now 
stretches south to the boundary with Elgin County. The 1993 annexation 
made London one of the largest urban municipalities in Ontario.[29] Intense 
commercial and residential development is presently occurring in the southwest 
and northwest areas of the city. Opponents of this development cite urban 
sprawl,[30] destruction of rare Carolinian zone forest and farm lands,[31] 
replacement of distinctive regions by generic malls, and standard transportation 
and pollution concerns as major issues facing London. The City of London 
is currently the eleventh-largest urban area in Canada, eleventh-largest 
census metropolitan area in Canada, and the sixth-largest city in Ontario.[32][33] 
The area was formed during the retreat of the glaciers during the last 
ice age, which produced areas of marshland, notably the Sifton Bog (which 
is actually a fen), as well as some of the most agriculturally productive 
areas of farmland in Ontario.[34] The Thames River dominates London's geography. 
The North and South branches of the Thames River meet at the centre of 
the city, a location known as "The Forks" or "The Fork of the Thames."[35] 
The North Thames runs through the man-made Fanshawe Lake, located in northeast 
London. Fanshawe Lake was created by Fanshawe Dam, constructed to protect 
the downriver areas from the catastrophic flooding which affected the city 
in 1883 and 1937.[36] London has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb), 
though due to its downwind location relative to Lake Huron and elevation 
changes across the city, it is virtually on the Dfa/Dfb (hot summer) boundary 
favouring the former climate zone to the southwest of the confluence of 
the South and North Thames Rivers, and the latter zone to the northeast 
(including the airport). Because of its location in the continent, London 
experiences large seasonal contrast, tempered to a point by the surrounding 
Great Lakes. The summers are usually warm to hot and humid, with a July 
average of 20.8 °C (69.4 °F), and temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F) occur 
on average 10 days per year.[37] In 2016, however, temperatures at or above 
30 °C (86 °F) occurred more than 35 times. The city is affected by frequent 
thunderstorms due to hot, humid summer weather, as well as the convergence 
of breezes originating from Lake Huron and Lake Erie. The same convergence 
zone is responsible for spawning funnel clouds and the occasional tornado. 
London is located in Canada's Tornado Alley. Spring and autumn in between 
are not long, and winters are cold but witness frequent thaws. Annual precipitation 
averages 1,011.5 mm (39.82 in). Its winter snowfall totals are heavy, averaging 
about 194 cm (76 in) per year.[37] The majority of it comes from lake effect 
snow and snow squalls originating from Lake Huron, some 60 km (37 mi) to 
the northwest, which occurs when strong, cold winds blow from that direction. 
From 5 December 2010, to 9 December 2010, London experienced record snowfall 
when up to 2 m (79 in) of snow fell in parts of the city. Schools and businesses 
were closed for three days and bus service was cancelled after the second 
day of snow.[38] The highest temperature ever recorded in London was 41.1 °C 
(106 °F) on 6 August 1918.[39] The lowest temperature ever recorded was 
−32.2 °C (−26 °F) on 20 January 1892.[40] London has a number of parks. 
Victoria Park in downtown London is a major centre of community events, 
attracting an estimated 1 million visitors per year. Other major parks 
include Harris Park, Gibbons Park, Fanshawe Conservation Area (Fanshawe 
Pioneer Village), Springbank Park, and Westminster Ponds. The city also 
maintains a number of gardens and conservatories.[35] According to the 
2011 census, the city of London had a population of 366,151 people, a 3.9% 
increase from the 2006 population.[53] Children under five accounted for 
approximately 5.2 percent of the resident population of London. The percentage 
of the resident population in London of retirement age (65 and over) is 
13.7, also the percentage for Canada as a whole. The average age is 38.2 
years of age, compared to 39.9 years of age for all of Canada.[54] Between 
2006 and 2011, the population of metropolitan London grew by 3.7 percent, 
compared with an increase of 5.7 percent for Ontario as a whole.[55] According 
to the 2011 census, the majority of Londoners profess a Christian faith, 
which accounts for 62.8 percent of the population (Roman Catholic: 27.0%, 
Protestant: 25.0%, other Christian: 9.0%). Other religions include Islam 
(4.4%), Buddhism (0.8%), Hinduism (0.8%), and Judaism (0.5%), with 29.9 
percent of the population reporting no religious affiliation. According 
to the 2011 census, 82.0 percent of the population of London are European, 
2.7 percent are Latin American, 2.6 percent are Arab, 2.4 percent are Black, 
2.2 percent are South Asian, 2.0 percent are Chinese Canadian, 1.9 percent 
are Aboriginal, 1.0 percent are Southeast Asian, 0.8 percent are West Asian, 
0.8 percent are Korean Canadian, 0.6 percent are Filipino, and 0.7 percent 
belong to other groups. In the 2011 census, the predominant ethnic origins 
of Londoners were English (30.5%), Canadian (26.0%), Scottish (20.8%), 
Irish (20.3%), German (11.5%), French (10.1%), Dutch (6.2%), Italian (4.7%), 
Polish (4.4%), Portuguese (2.8%), and Ukrainian (2.5%).[53] In February 
2015, Statistics Canada published a population estimate of the London CMA 
of 502,360, as of July 1, 2014.[56] London's economy is dominated by medical 
research, insurance, manufacturing, and information technology.[citation 
needed] Much of the life sciences and biotechnology-related research is 
conducted or supported by the University of Western Ontario, which adds 
about C$1.5 billion to the London economy annually.[57] Since the economic 
crisis of 2009, which gutted many of London's manufacturing jobs, the city 
has transitioned to become a technology hub. As of 2016, London is home 
to 300 technology companies and employs 3% of the city's labor force.[58] 
Many of these companies have moved into former factories and industrial 
spaces located in and around the downtown core, and have renovated them 
as modern offices. For example, Info-Tech Research Group's London office 
is located in a hosiery factory, and Arcane Digital moved into a 1930s 
industrial building in 2015.[59] rTraction, a digital media firm, currently 
has its offices in the London Roundhouse, a steam locomotive repair shop 
built in 1887. Its redesign, which opened in 2015, won the 2015 Paul Oberman 
Award for Adaptive Re-Use from the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario.[60] 
London is also home to Diply, which is ranked among the top websites on 
the Internet. The largest employer in London is the London Health Sciences 
Centre, which employs 10, 555 people.[61] The headquarters of the Canadian 
division of 3M are located in London. The London Life Insurance Company 
was founded there,[62] as was Imperial Oil,[63] GoodLife Fitness, and both 
the Labatt and Carling breweries. The Libro Financial Group was founded 
in London 1951 and is the second largest credit union in Ontario and employs 
over 550 people.[64] Canada Trust was also founded in London in 1864.[65] 
General Dynamics Land Systems builds armoured personnel carriers in the 
city.[66] GDLS has a 14-year $15-billion deal to supply light armoured 
vehicles to Saudi Arabia.[67] There are 2,400 workers at GDLS Canada.[67] 
McCormick Canada, formerly Club House Foods, was founded in 1883 and currently 
employs more than 600 Londoners. London's fledgling city centre mall, previously 
known as Galleria, was purchased and renamed to Citi Plaza by Citigroup 
in 2009. Citi Plaza has been redeveloped as a mixed use complex that blends 
retail, office, businesses, and education providers. Alongside Citi Cards 
Canada's offices, the complex is also home to London's central library 
branch, and satellite campuses for both Fanshawe College and Western University. 
A portion of the city's population work in factories outside of the city 
limits, including the General Motors automotive plant CAMI, and a Toyota 
plant in Woodstock. A Ford plant in Talbotville became one of the casualties 
of the economic crisis in 2011.[68] 11 December 2009, Minister of State 
Gary Goodyear announced a new $11-million cargo terminal at the London 
International Airport.[69] The city is home to many festivals including 
Sunfest, the Home County Folk Festival, the London Fringe Theatre Festival, 
the Expressions in Chalk Street Painting Festival, Rock the Park, Western 
Fair, Dundas Street Festival, and The International Food Festival. The 
London Rib-Fest is the second largest barbecue rib festival in North America.[70] 
Pride London Festival is the 11th largest Pride festival in Ontario.[71] 
Sunfest, a World music festival, is the second biggest in Canada after 
Toronto Caribbean Carnival (Caribana) in Toronto, and is among the top 
100 summer destinations in North America.[72] Orchestra London Canada was 
a professional symphony orchestra founded in London in 1937. Although the 
organization filed for bankruptcy in 2015, members of the orchestra continue 
to play self-produced concerts under the moniker #WePlayOn. As of October 
2016, the group is surveying the community for ideas about a new name and 
brand for the ensemble.[73] London is also home to the London Community 
Orchestra, the London Youth Symphony, and the Amabile Choirs of London, 
Canada. London also has a rich history in underground music. Noise pioneers, 
the Nihilist Spasm Band were formed in the city in 1965. Between 1966 and 
1971, the group held a Monday night residency at the York Hotel in the 
city's core, which established it as a popular venue for emerging musicians 
and artists. Now known as Call the Office, the venue served as a hotbed 
for punk music in the late 1970s and 1980s, and continues to host college 
rock bands and weekly alternative music nights. In 2003, CHRW-FM developed 
the London Music Archives, an online music database that chronicles every 
album recorded in London between 1967 and 2006.[74] London's performance 
venues include Aeolian Hall, a former Victorian-era town hall located in 
Old East Village, and the London Music Hall, a multi-level performance 
space in the downtown's Entertainment & Culture District. Guy Lombardo, 
an internationally acclaimed big band leader, was born in London, as was 
jazz musician Rob McConnell. Contemporary musicians born in London include 
hip hop artist and former CBC Radio host, Shad, and singer-songwriter Meaghan 
Smith. Justin Beiber was born in London prior to moving to Stratford, Ontario. 
The city is home to several museums, including Museum London, which is 
located at the Forks of the Thames. Museum London exhibits art by a wide 
variety of local, regional and national artists.[75] London is also home 
to the Museum of Ontario Archaeology, owned by Western University. Its 
main feature is Canada's only on-going excavation and partial reconstruction 
of a prehistoric village of the Neutral Nation (Lawson Site).[76] The Royal 
Canadian Regiment Museum is a military museum located at Wolseley Barracks, 
a former Canadian Forces Base in the city's Carling neighbourhood. The 
Secrets of Radar Museum was opened at Parkwood Hospital in 2003, and tells 
the story of the more than 6,000 Canadian World War II veterans who were 
recruited into a top-secret project during World War II involving radar. 
The London Regional Children's Museum, located in South London, provides 
hands-on learning experiences for children and was one of the first children's 
museums established in Canada. The Canadian Medical Hall of Fame has its 
headquarters in downtown London and features a medical history museum. 
Eldon House is the former residence of the prominent Harris Family and 
oldest surviving such building in London. The entire property was donated 
to the city of London in 1959 and is now a heritage site. An Ontario Historical 
Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate The Eldon House's role 
in Ontario's heritage.[77] The Banting House National Historic Site of 
Canada is the house where Sir Frederick Banting thought of the idea that 
led to the discovery of insulin. Banting lived and practiced in London 
for ten months, from July 1920 to May 1921. London is also the site of 
the Flame of Hope, which is intended to burn until a cure for diabetes 
is discovered.[78] London is also home to a number of art galleries and 
artist spaces including the McIntosh Gallery at Western University, and 
the London ARTS Project; a gallery, studio, and theatre space located on 
Dundas Street in the city's Entertainment & Culture District. The Forest 
City Gallery, co-founded by Greg Curnoe in 1973, is one of Canada's first 
artist run centres. It is currently located in the SoHo neighbourhood, 
south of downtown. London also hosts an annual Nuit Blanche each June. 
London is home to the Grand Theatre, a professional proscenium arch theatre 
located in Central London. The building underwent renovations in 1975 to 
restore the stage's proscenium arch and to add a secondary performance 
space. The architectural firm responsible for the re-design was awarded 
a Governor General's award in 1978 for their work on the venue. In addition 
to professional productions, the Grand Theatre also hosts the High School 
Project, a program unique to North America that provides high school students 
an opportunity to work with professional directors, choreographers, musical 
directors, and stage managers. The Palace Theatre, located in Old East 
Village, originally opened as a silent movie theatre in 1929 and was converted 
to a live theatre venue in 1991.[79] It is currently the home of the London 
Community Players, and as of 2016 is undergoing extensive historical restoration. 
The Original Kids Theatre Company, a nonprofit charitable youth organization, 
currently puts on productions at the Spriet Family Theatre in the Covent 
Garden Market.[80] London serves a core setting in Southern Ontario Gothic 
literature, most notably in the works of James Reaney. Modern writers include 
fantasy writer Kelley Armstrong, Man Booker Prize winner, Eleanor Catton, 
and Scotiabank Giller Prize nominee, Joan Barfoot. Emma Donoghue, whose 
2010 novel, Room, was adapted into a 2015 Academy Award winning film of 
the same name, also lives in London. Words is an annual literary and creative 
arts festival that takes place each November.[81] London's recent urban 
regeneration efforts and civic initiatives have allowed the city to rank 
high in Canadian livability lists. In 2016, MoneySense magazine ranked 
London as the fourth best large Canadian city to live in.[82] It also ranked 
fourth (fifteenth overall) in 2013, and fifth in 2015.[83][84] In 2015, 
London was ranked as the sixth happiest city in Canada by Jetpac City Guides.[85] 
The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives ranked London as the sixth 
best place to be a woman in 2015[86] and third in 2016.[87] The city's 
cost of living is low compared to other southern Ontario cities. According 
to the London St. Thomas Association of Realtors, the average price of 
a home in the London and St. Thomas area in 2016 is $274,383, which is 
substantially lower than the national average of $467,082. It is also well 
below the average home prices of nearby cities including Toronto ($736,670), 
Hamilton ($510,204), and Kitchener-Waterloo ($364,290).[88] The 2015 average 
rental rate for a one-bedroom apartment is $781. London has nine major 
parks and gardens throughout the city, many of which run along the Thames 
River and are interconnected by a series of pedestrian and bike paths, 
known as the Thames Valley Parkway.[89] This path system is 40 km (25 mi) 
in length, and connects to an additional 150 km (93 mi) of bike and hiking 
trails throughout the city.[90] The city's largest park, Springbank Park, 
is 140-hectare (300 acre) and contains 30 km (19 mi) of trails. It is also 
home to Storybook Gardens, a family attraction open year-round. London 
is currently the home of the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League, 
who play at the Budweiser Gardens (previously known as the John Labatt 
Centre). The Knights are 2004-2005 and 2015-2016 OHL and Memorial Cup Champions.[91] 
During the summer months, the London Majors of the Intercounty Baseball 
League play at Labatt Park. London City of the Canadian Soccer League, 
is the highest level of soccer in London. The club was founded in 1973; 
it is the oldest active professional soccer franchise in North America.[92] 
The squad plays at Cove Road Stadium at the German Canadian Club. Other 
sports teams include the London Silver Dolphins Swim Team, the Forest City 
Volleyball Club, London Cricket Club, the London St. George's Rugby Club, 
the London Aquatics Club, the London Rhythmic Gymnastics Club, London City 
Soccer Club and Forest City London. Football teams include the London Beefeaters 
(Ontario Football Conference). London's basketball team, the London Lightning 
plays at Budweiser Gardens as members of the National Basketball League 
of Canada. Finishing their inaugural regular season at 28-8, the Lightning 
would go on to win the 2011-12 NBL Canada championship, defeating the Halifax 
Rainmen in the finals three games to two. There are also a number of former 
sports teams that have now either moved or folded. London's four former 
baseball teams are the London Monarchs (Canadian Baseball League), the 
London Werewolves (Frontier League), the London Tecumsehs (International 
Association) and the London Tigers (AA Eastern League). Other former sports 
teams include the London Lasers (Canadian Soccer League) and the London 
Nationals (Western Ontario Hockey League). In March 2013, London hosted 
the 2013 World Figure Skating Championships. The University of Western 
Ontario teams play under the name Mustangs. The university's football team 
plays at TD Waterhouse Stadium.[93] Western's Rowing Team rows out of one 
of two National Training Centres at Fanshawe Lake. Fanshawe College teams 
play under the name Falcons. The Women's Cross Country team has won 3 consecutive 
Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) National Championships.[94] 
In 2010, the program cemented itself as the first CCAA program to win both 
Men's and Women's National team titles, as well as CCAA Coach of the Year.[95] 
The Western Fair Raceway, about 85 acres harness racing track and simulcast 
centre, operates year-round.[96] The grounds include a coin slot casino, 
a former IMAX theatre, and Sports and Agri-complex. Labatt Memorial Park 
the world's oldest continuously used baseball grounds[97][98] was established 
as Tecumseh Park in 1877; it was renamed in 1937, because the London field 
has been flooded and rebuilt twice (1883 and 1937), including a re-orientation 
of the bases (after the 1883 flood). The Forest City Velodrome, located 
at the former London Ice House, is the only indoor cycling track in Ontario 
and the third to be built in North America, opened in 2005.[99] London's 
municipal government is divided among fourteen councillors (one representing 
each of London's fourteen wards) and the mayor. Matt Brown was elected 
mayor in the 2014 municipal election, officially taking office on 1 December 
2014[update].[100] Prior to Brown's election, London's most recent elected 
mayor was Joe Fontana; following Fontana's resignation on 19 June 2014, 
city councillor Joe Swan served as acting mayor[101] until councillor Joni 
Baechler was selected as interim mayor 24 June.[102] Until the elections 
in 2010, there was a Board of Control, consisting of four controllers and 
the mayor, all elected citywide.[103] The composition of London City Council 
was challenged by two ballot questions during the civic election of 2003. 
A proposal to restructure the municipal government would have reduced the 
council to ten wards and eliminated the Board of Control. The council could 
not come to a determination and as a result decided to put two questions 
on the ballot for the fall 2003 election: whether city council should be 
reduced in size and whether the Board of Control should be eliminated. 
While the "yes" votes prevailed in both instances, the voter turnout failed 
to exceed 50 per cent and was therefore insufficient to make the decisions 
binding under the Municipal Act. When the council voted to retain the status 
quo, Imagine London, a citizens group, petitioned the Ontario Municipal 
Board (OMB) to change the ward composition of the city from seven wards 
in a roughly radial pattern from the downtown core, to 14 wards defined 
by communities of interest.[104] The OMB ruled for the petitioners in December 
2005 and, while the city sought leave to appeal the OMB decision via the 
courts, leave was denied on 28 February 2006, in a decision of Superior 
Court's Justice McDermid.[105] In response, the city conceded change, but 
asked for special legislation from the province to ensure that there will 
only be one councillor in each of the 14 new wards, not two. 1 June 2006, 
the Ontario bill received royal assent, which guarantees that London will 
have one councillor per ward.[106] Although London has many ties to Middlesex 
County, it is now "separated" and the two have no jurisdictional overlap. 
The exception is the Middlesex County courthouse and former jail, as the 
judiciary is administered directly by the province.[107] In the provincial 
government, London is represented by Liberal Deb Matthews (London North 
Centre); Progressive Conservative Jeff Yurek (Elgin—Middlesex—London), 
and NDPs: Teresa Armstrong (London—Fanshawe) and Peggy Sattler (London 
West).[108] In the federal government, London is represented by Conservative 
Karen Vecchio (Elgin—Middlesex—London), Liberals Peter Fragiskatos (London 
North Centre) and Kate Young (London West), and NDP Irene Mathyssen (London—Fanshawe).[109] 
In 2001, the City of London first published their Facilities Accessibility 
Design Standards (FADS) which was one of the first North American municipal 
accessibility requirements to include Universal Design. It has since been 
adopted by over 50 municipalities in Canada and the United States.[110] 
Between 1959 and 1984, London contained the largest concentration of serial 
killers in the world, as the city was startled by 29 murders. During that 
time period, up to six serial killers may have been operating in London,[111] 
though three were convicted for 13 of the killings: Gerald Thomas Archer 
(the "London Chamber Maid Slayer"), Christian Magee (the "Mad Slasher") 
and Russell Johnson (the "Balcony Killer"), with the other 16 murders still 
unsolved as of August 2015.[112] The City of London initiatives in Old 
East London are helping to create a renewed sense of vigour in the East 
London Business District. Specific initiatives include the creation of 
the Old East Heritage Conservation District under Part V of the Ontario 
Heritage Act, special Building Code policies and Facade Restoration Programs.[113] 
London is home to heritage properties representing a variety of architectural 
styles,[114] including Queen Anne, Art Deco, Modern, and Brutalist Londoners 
have become protective of the trees in the city, protesting "unnecessary" 
removal of trees.[115] The City Council and tourist industry have created 
projects to replant trees throughout the city. As well, they have begun 
to erect metal trees of various colours in the downtown area, causing some 
controversy.[116] London is at the junction of Highway 401 that connects 
the city to Toronto and Detroit, and Highway 402 to Sarnia.[117][118] Also, 
Highway 403, which diverges from the 401 at nearby Woodstock, Ontario, 
provides ready access to Brantford, Hamilton, the Golden Horseshoe area, 
and the Niagara Peninsula.[119] Many smaller two-lane highways also pass 
through or near London, including Kings Highways 2, 3, 4, 7 and 22. Many 
of these are "historical" names, as provincial downloading in the 1980s 
and 1990s put responsibility for most provincial highways on municipal 
governments.[120] Nevertheless, these roads continue to provide access 
from London to nearby communities and locations in much of Western Ontario, 
including Goderich, Port Stanley and Owen Sound. Since the 1970s, London 
has improved urban road alignments that eliminated "jogs" in established 
traffic patterns over 19th-century street mis-alignments. The lack of a 
municipal freeway (either through or around the city) as well as the presence 
of two significant railways (each with attendant switching yards and few 
over/under-passes) are the primary causes of rush hour congestion, along 
with construction and heavy snow. Thus, traffic times can be significantly 
variable, although major traffic jams are rare.[121] Wellington Road between 
Commissioners Road E and Southdale Road E is London's busiest section of 
roadway, with more than 46,000 vehicles using the span on an average day[122] 
City council rejected early plans for the construction of a freeway, and 
instead accepted the Veterans Memorial Parkway to serve the east end.[123] 
Some Londoners have expressed concern that the absence of a local freeway 
may hinder London's economic and population growth, while others have voiced 
concern that such a freeway would destroy environmentally sensitive areas 
and further contribute to London's suburban sprawl.[121] Road capacity 
improvements have been made to Veterans Memorial Parkway (formerly named 
Airport Road and Highway 100) in the industrialized east end.[124] However, 
the Parkway has received criticism for not being built as a proper highway; 
a recent city-run study suggested upgrading it by replacing the intersections 
with interchanges.[125] London's public transit system is run by the London 
Transit Commission, which has 44 bus routes throughout the city.[126] Although 
the city has lost ridership over the last few years, the commission is 
making concerted efforts to enhance services by implementing a five-year 
improvement plan. In 2015, an additional 17,000 hours of bus service was 
added throughout the city. In 2016, 11 new operators, 5 new busses, and 
another 17,0000 hours of bus service were added to the network.[127] Bus 
service is currently the only mode of public transit available to the public 
in London, with no available rapid transit networks like those used in 
other Canadian cities. However, city council approved a bus rapid transit 
(BRT) business case in May 2016 that will see a rapid transit system running 
in L- and 7-shaped corridors throughout the city. Construction is expected 
to begin in 2018, with the service fully operational by 2025.[128] London 
does have several taxi and for-hire limousine services. London has 330 km 
(205 mi) of cycling paths throughout the city, 91 km (59 mi) of which have 
been added since 2005.[129] In June 2016, London unveiled its first bike 
corrals, which replace parking for one vehicle with fourteen bicycle parking 
spaces, and fix-it stations, which provide cyclists with simple tools and 
a bicycle pump, throughout the city.[130] In September 2016, city council 
approved a new 15 year cycling master plan that will see the construction 
of an additional 470 km (292 mi) of cycling paths added to the existing 
network.[129][131] London is on the Canadian National Railway main line 
between Toronto and Chicago (with a secondary main line to Windsor) and 
the Canadian Pacific Railway main line between Toronto and Detroit.[132] 
Via Rail operates regional passenger service through London station as 
part of the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, with connections to the United 
States.[133] Via Rail's London terminal is the fourth-busiest passenger 
terminal in Canada.[132] London is also a destination for inter-city bus 
travellers. London is the seventh-busiest Greyhound Canada terminal in 
terms of passengers,[134] and connecting services radiate from London throughout 
Southwestern Ontario and through to the American cities of Detroit, Michigan 
and Chicago, Illinois. Aboutown Transportation is a diversified transportation 
company based in the city that operates the North Link,[135] intercity 
bus service from Owen Sound, and six transit bus routes between Kings and 
Brescia Colleges, and the main campus at the University of Western Ontario. 
London International Airport (YXU) is the 12th busiest passenger airport 
in Canada and the 11th busiest airport in Canada by take-offs and landings.[132] 
It is served by airlines including Air Canada Jazz, United Airlines and 
WestJet, and provides direct flights to both domestic and international 
destinations, including Toronto, Chicago, Las Vegas, Orlando, Ottawa, Winnipeg, 
Calgary and Cancún.[136] The city of London is considering bus rapid transit 
(BRT) and/or high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV) to help it achieve its 
long-term transportation plan. Additional cycleways are planned for integration 
in road-widening projects, where there is need and sufficient space along 
routes. An expressway/freeway network is possible along the eastern and 
western ends of the city, from Highway 401 (and Highway 402 for the western 
route) past Oxford Street, potentially with another highway, joining the 
two in the city's north end.[121] The City of London has assessed the entire 
length of the Veterans Memorial Parkway, identifying areas where interchanges 
can be constructed, grade separations can occur, and where cul-de-sacs 
can be placed. Upon completion, the Veterans Memorial Parkway would no 
longer be an expressway, but a freeway, for the majority of its length.[137] 
A high-speed rail station has been proposed for London, connecting it to 
a future high-speed rail line along the Quebec City-Windsor corridor. It 
would run along the Canadian National rail right of way through the city.[138] 
London public elementary and secondary schools are governed by four school 
boards – the Thames Valley District School Board, the London District Catholic 
School Board and the French first language school boards (the Conseil scolaire 
Viamonde and the Conseil scolaire catholique Providence or CSC).[139] The 
CSC has a satellite office in London.[140] There are also more than twenty 
private schools in the city.[139] London is home to London Central Secondary 
School, the highest ranking academic school in Ontario.[141] The city is 
home to two post-secondary institutions: the University of Western Ontario 
(UWO) and Fanshawe College, a college of applied arts and technology.[139] 
UWO, founded in 1878, has about 3500 full-time faculty and staff members 
and almost 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students.[142] It placed tenth 
in the 2008 Maclean's magazine rankings of Canadian universities.[143] 
The Richard Ivey School of Business, part of UWO, was formed in 1922 and 
ranked among the best business schools in the country by the Financial 
Times in 2009.[144] UWO has three affiliated colleges: Brescia University 
College, founded in 1919 (Canada's only university-level women's college);[145][146] 
Huron University College, founded in 1863 (also the founding college of 
UWO) and King's University College, founded in 1954.[147][148] All three 
are liberal arts colleges with religious affiliations: Huron with the Anglican 
Church of Canada, King's and Brescia with the Roman Catholic Church.[149] 
London is also home to Lester B. Pearson School for the Arts one of few 
of its kind. Fanshawe College has an enrollment of approximately 15,000 
students, including 3,500 apprentices and over 500 international students 
from over 30 countries.[150] It also has almost 40,000 students in part-time 
continuing education courses.[150] Fanshawe's Key Performance Indicators 
(KPI) have been over the provincial average for many years now, with increasing 
percentages year by year.[151] The Ontario Institute of Audio Recording 
Technology (OIART) is also in London. Founded in 1983, it offers recording 
studio experience for audio engineering students.[152] Westervelt College 
is also located in London. This private career college was founded in 1885 
and offers several diploma programs.[153] London currently has one sister
