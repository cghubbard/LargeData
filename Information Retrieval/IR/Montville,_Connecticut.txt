Montville is a town in New London County, Connecticut in the United States. 
The population was 19,571 at the 2010 census.[1] The villages of Chesterfield, 
Mohegan, Oakdale, and Uncasville are located within the town; the latter 
two have their own ZIP codes. Town residents often identify with these 
villages more than the Town of Montville as a whole, and the Mohegan Sun 
casino resort is nearby. In the 17th century, when English settlers arrived, 
southeastern Connecticut was the scene of rivalry between the Pequot people, 
the dominant Native American group in the New London area, and the newly 
independent Mohegan. The latter became friendly to the English. For defense 
against the Pequot, the Mohegan sachem Uncas had established a fortified 
village on a promontory above the Thames River within what is now the town 
of Montville. The Mohegan village, now known as Fort Shantok, was protected 
on the inland side by palisades first built in about 1636 at the time of 
the Pequot War, rebuilt during wars with the Narragansett people circa 
1653–1657, and rebuilt again at the time of King Philip's War (1675–1676). 
When the boundaries of New London (then called "Pequot") were first defined 
in 1646, the Oxoboxo River formed the northern boundary. Parts of the modern 
town of Montville lying south of the river were included in New London, 
while the area north of the river was treated as Mohegan land. Over time 
the settlers assumed control of Mohegan lands. In 1703 the area between 
the Oxoboxo River and Norwich (now part of the town of Montville) was annexed 
by New London.[2] In 1786 Montville was separated from New London and incorporated 
as a separate Town. Before incorporation, it was known as the North Parish 
of New London. In 1819 the adjacent Town of Salem was formed from parts 
of the towns of Montville, Lyme, and Colchester.[3] Four properties in 
town are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 44.2 square 
miles (114.4 km2), of which 42.0 square miles (108.7 km2) is land and 2.2 
square miles (5.8 km2), or 5.06%, is water.[4] Town residents often identify 
with these villages more than the Town of Montville as a whole. The center 
of Oakdale is small, consisting of only a few private residences and the 
post office. The Mohegan Sun casino resort is often referred to as being 
in Uncasville, although the village is three miles to the south. The Mohegan 
refer to Uncasville as it is named for a prominent sachem of theirs from 
the 17th century. As of the census[7] of 2000, there were 18,546 people, 
6,426 households, and 4,678 families residing in the town. The population 
density was 441.4 people per square mile (170.4/km²). There were 6,805 
housing units at an average density of 162.0 per square mile (62.5/km²). 
The racial makeup of the town was 86.03% White, 5.49% African American, 
1.46% Native American, 1.89% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 2.23% from 
other races, and 2.86% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any 
race were 5.45% of the population. There were 6,426 households out of which 
34.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.6% were married 
couples living together, 9.9% had a female householder with no husband 
present, and 27.2% were non-families. 21.3% of all households were made 
up of individuals and 7.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of 
age or older. The average household size was 2.63 and the average family 
size was 3.05. In the town the population was spread out with 23.6% under 
the age of 18, 8.5% from 18 to 24, 34.2% from 25 to 44, 22.8% from 45 to 
64, and 10.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 
years. For every 100 females there were 117.2 males. For every 100 females 
age 18 and over, there were 119.7 males. The median income for a household 
in the town was $55,086, and the median income for a family was $61,643. 
Males had a median income of $40,922 versus $30,206 for females. The per 
capita income for the town was $22,357. About 3.1% of families and 4.1% 
of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.3% of those 
under age 18 and 4.5% of those age 65 or over. Part of Montville is also 
treated by the U.S. Census Bureau as a census-designated place called Oxoboxo 
River. The Mohegan Native American Tribal Nation has been a presence in 
this area of Connecticut since the 16th century, and descended from indigenous 
cultures in the area for thousands of years. In the seventeenth century, 
the colony of Connecticut granted them a 700-acre (2.8 km2) reservation, 
located north of the present-day village of Uncasville. Although the reservation 
is within the borders of the town of Montville, the tribe is federally 
recognized as a sovereign nation not subject to local or state laws. In 
addition to operating the Mohegan Sun, a casino resort that opened in 1996, 
the tribal nation also provides educational programs about their nation's 
heritage and history. Since at least the 1990s, people of Chinese descent 
have moved into the area drawn either by the work available at Mohegan 
Sun and/or the rising prices in the Northeast's Chinatowns. Their residence, 
the subject of an exhibition that travelled from the Lyman Allyn Museum 
in New London to New York City's Museum of Chinese in America, has sparked 
at least one racist incident. [8] Public schools in Montville are overseen 
by the town's board of education, which includes nine elected members and 
two high school student representatives.[9] The school system operates 
a regular high school, an alternative high school, a middle school, and 
three elementary schools.[10] Montville High School serves grades 9 through 
12. Enrollment is approximately 800 students.[10] Located in Uncasville, 
Mohegan Sun is one of the largest casinos in the world.[citation needed] 
The Mohegan Tribe of Connecticut created the casino in 1996. With over 
250,000 square feet (23,000 m2), the Mohegan Sun complex features a luxury 
hotel, entertainment theater, and more than 20 restaurants and stores. 
Mohegan Sun is one of Montville's primary economic locations. It has provided 
a significant increase in job opportunities and attracted a population 
influx. Mohegan Sun is also home to the Mohegan Sun Arena, the site of 
concerts and live sporting events for Uncasville. It is the home of the 
WNBA Connecticut Sun. NRG Energy Inc., based in La Jolla, California, operates 
an oil and natural gas-powered electricity generating plant in Montville, 
labeled by environmentalists as one of the "Sooty Six", the dirtiest power 
plants in the state. The plant was required to install pollution controls 
to comply with the state's 2002 power plant pollution law. In June 2006 
the company proposed building a new type of coal-powered plant on the site 
for $1.6 billion.[11] In return for building the plant, the company demanded 
that the state guarantee NRG long-term contracts for buying the electricity 
it generates and pick NRG's proposal over other plans for building new 
power plants in the state. At the time of NRG's proposal, only 18 plants 
in the world and two in North America used the Integrated Gasification 
Combined-Cycle technology which the company suggested.[11] Contracts were 
to be awarded by the DPUC in early 2007. The company said the new plant 
could open in 2012. NRG Energy announced plans on August 5, 2013 to add
