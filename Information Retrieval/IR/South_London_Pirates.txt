Black, gold and grey The South London Pirates, known until 2012 as the 
Croydon Pirates, is a British baseball club based in South London. They 
have two diamonds based in Roundshaw playing fields in south Croydon, their 
main one being "Dave Ward 1", which is classed as one of the best baseball 
diamonds in the UK, meaning the Pirates are hosts to the London Tournament 
every year and on occasions The National Finals. The first team known as 
P1 competes in the NBL League, which is the top flight of British baseball. 
In 2004 and 2005 Croydon Pirates I were National Champions and were runners 
up in 2006. In 2007 Croydon Pirates I, again won the National League, earning 
them the right to compete in the Final 4 tournament on the weekend of 1–2 
September 2007, along with The London Mets, Menwith Hill Patriots and Liverpool 
Trojans. Croydon and the Mets won their semi-finals to advanced to the 
final where the Pirates were defeated 2–0 in a best of 3 series. The team 
is one of the most diverse, having other 15 nationalities at the club in 
one season. In 2008, Croydon Pirates III won the British Baseball A-Division, 
finishing the season with a record of 10 wins and 2 losses. They were subsequently 
promoted to the AA-Division in 2009, Pirates III having a very strong season 
tying joint first place. However, the Kent Mariners and Brentwood Stags 
had better offensive stats, rather than having a 3-way play-off, these 
2 teams made it to the Championships. In 2011, Pirates I were defeated 
at the Play-off stage. In 2012 the club changed its name to the South London 
Pirates, and dropped from 3 teams to 2. South London Pirates I (P1) play 
in the British NBL League; while South London Pirates III (P3) play in 
the AA South Division. They continue to host the London tournament on their 
home diamond, Dave Ward Field. They have a second diamond, Dave Ward 2, 
as well as setting up other temporary diamonds around Roundshaw playing
