José Benjamin Molina (Spanish pronunciation: [xoˈse moˈlina]; born June 
3, 1975) is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball catcher in Major 
League Baseball (MLB). A two-time World Series champion, Molina was noted 
for his abilities in pitch-framing and in handling pitching staffs.[1] 
Molina is the middle of three brothers (older brother Bengie and younger 
brother Yadier), all of whom have played catcher in Major League Baseball. 
They are the only three brothers in MLB history to all win World Series 
rings. Bengie and José did it together as members of the 2002 Anaheim Angels, 
and Yadier with the 2006 and 2011 Cardinals. José later won a second ring 
with the 2009 New York Yankees. Molina graduated from Maestro Ladi High 
School in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico in 1993, and attended Ladislao Martinez 
High School in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico.[2] Molina was drafted by the Chicago 
Cubs in the 14th round of the 1993 amateur draft. Molina's first major 
league team was the Cubs, for which he played 10 games in 1999. He joined 
the then-Anaheim Angels in 2001 as a free agent, but played only a handful 
of games before establishing himself during the 2002 season as the Angels 
backup catcher for his brother, Bengie. In 2002, Molina got his first World 
Series ring as the Angels won the 2002 World Series against the San Francisco 
Giants. In 2005, Molina hit a career-best six home runs, and tied his career-high 
with 25 RBI, as he hit .306 against lefties. Following Bengie's departure 
from the Angels, José entered the 2006 season as the Angels' new starting 
catcher, though it was expected that rookie Jeff Mathis would also see 
substantial time handling the team's catching duties over the course of 
the season. Mathis struggled during the first month of the season, however, 
and was demoted to the minor leagues. Molina himself then struggled offensively, 
and the promising offensive performance of Mathis' replacement on the roster, 
rookie Mike Napoli, once again relegated Molina to the role of backup catcher. 
Still, Molina played in a career-high 78 games and had a career-best 225 
at-bats in 2006. On July 21, 2007, Molina was traded to the New York Yankees 
for minor league pitcher Jeff Kennard. At the time of the trade, he had 
a .237 lifetime batting average, but had hit lefties much better (.269). 
He would go on to hit .318 for the Yankees with 1 home run. On December 
3, 2007, the Yankees signed Molina to a two-year deal.[3] He served as 
the team's starting catcher following a shoulder injury to Jorge Posada, 
but returned to the backup role when the Yankees acquired Iván Rodríguez. 
On September 21, 2008, Molina hit the last home run in the original Yankee 
Stadium, in the Yankees' final game at the ballpark, which was against 
the Baltimore Orioles. Following this event, he expressed satisfaction 
after closing the question presented by Babe Ruth in his last public speech 
at the facility, which closed by stating, "I was glad to have hit the first 
home run in this park. God only knows who will hit the last." Molina was 
successful in eight of nine sacrifice bunt attempts in 2008.[4] In 2009, 
Molina again served as the Yankees' primary backup catcher, catching most 
of A. J. Burnett's games when possible and hitting .219 in 138 at bats 
(52 games). On October 29, 2009 in Game two of the 2009 World Series, he 
picked off Jayson Werth at first base becoming the first Yankees catcher 
to pick a baserunner off in the World Series since Yogi Berra who did the 
same in the 1950 World Series, also against the Philadelphia Phillies. 
Molina got his second World Series ring as the Yankees defeated the Phillies 
in the 2009 World Series in 6 games. On February 19, 2010, Molina signed 
a 1-year contract that included an option for 2011 with the Toronto Blue 
Jays.[5] He had one of his best offensive seasons in 2010, producing a 
.681 OPS with 6 home runs over 57 games. Molina returned to the Blue Jays 
for the 2011 season, providing veteran guidance to rookie J. P. Arencibia. 
The club picked up his option for $1.2million.[6] In a rarely seen lineup 
move, Molina was named the designated hitter on May 27, 2011 against the 
White Sox. In addition to getting 3 hits on the night off Mark Buehrle, 
Jose Molina and Rajai Davis executed a double steal; only Molina's 11th 
stolen base in his 12-year career. On November 28, 2011, Molina signed 
a one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Rays.[7] After posting a .223 average 
with 8 home runs and 32 RBI, Molina's 2013 contract option for $1.8 million 
was picked up by the Rays.[8] On December 2, 2013, after another season 
with Tampa Bay in which he hit .233 with 2 home runs and 18 RBI, Molina 
signed a two-year, $4.5 million contract with the Rays.[9] Molina was released 
on November 24, 2014.[10] On November 6, 2015 Molina was hired as a catching 
coordinator for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim to work with catchers 
in their farm system. In the minors, Molina was rated as the best defensive 
catcher in the Pacific Coast League by Baseball America in 2002. In his 
years with the Cubs and Angels, Molina displayed better than average range 
as a catcher, and also played 9 games at first base. In 2004, he threw 
out 22 of 45 base stealers (48.89%), tops in the AL (minimum of 40 attempts). 
He also led AL catchers with five pickoffs in 2004, despite only 57 starts. 
In 2005, he caught more than half of those who attempted to steal against 
him, again the best percentage in the AL.[11] In 2008, he again played 
excellent defense, and displayed his excellent arm, replacing the injured 
Jorge Posada. In a game against the Tampa Bay Rays on April 25, 2010, Molina 
set a Blue Jays club record by throwing out four attempted basestealers 
in one game, including defending American League basestealing champion 
Carl Crawford, who was thrown out twice. This was the first time an AL 
catcher caught four basestealers in one game since Terry Steinbach in 1992.[12] 
Molina earned a silver medal as a backup catcher to his brother Yadier
