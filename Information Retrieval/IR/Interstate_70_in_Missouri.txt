In the U.S. state of Missouri, Interstate 70 (I-70) is generally parallel 
to the Missouri River. This section of the transcontinental Interstate 
begins at the Kansas state line on the Lewis and Clark Viaduct, concurrent 
with U.S. Routes 24, 40, and 169, and the east end is on the Stan Musial 
Veterans Memorial Bridge in St. Louis. While passing through Kansas City, 
I-70 is known as the "George Brett Super Highway", named after the former 
third baseman of the Kansas City Royals who is a member of the Baseball 
Hall of Fame. The Truman Sports Complex, which houses the Royals' and Chiefs' 
stadiums, is located along I-70 at I-435. Beginning on the Lewis and Clark 
Viaduct, I-70 immediately encounters the Alphabet Loop, a small but complex 
loop of freeways with all of its exits having a number of 2 and a letter 
suffix that uses the entire alphabet (except I, O, and Z).[2][1] I-35 becomes 
concurrent with I-70 as soon as the highway gets into the Loop, and maintain 
the concurrency until the northeastern corner of the Loop.[3] Back at the 
northwest corner, US 169 splits off to the north, leaving four routes concurrent 
with each other. There is a large interchange with Route 9 as the Loop 
reaches the northeastern corner.[4] When it does reach the corner, US 24 
splits to the east, I-29 ends, and US 71 joins.[5] After that, the freeway 
turns south, with interchanges to more roads. At the southeastern end, 
I-70/US 40/US 71 exit the Loop, where I-70/US 40 split off to the east 
and US 71 continues south. I-670 ends where I-70/US 40 usurp the alignment.[6] 
Soon after usurpation, I-70/US 40 turn southeast, and at exit 7A, US 40 
departs from I-70.[7] Soon after that, I-70 interchanges with I-435, the 
beltway around Kansas City.[8] East of I-435, I-70 continues east through 
Independence, passing a busy cloverleaf interchange at I-470.[9] The highway 
then continues with six lanes to the rapidly growing suburb of Blue Springs, 
where the roadway narrows to four lanes (two each direction) at Route 7.[10] 
I-70 remains at this width until just west of the intersection with I-64/US 40/US 61 
in Wentzville, over 170 miles (270 km) away. East of Blue Springs, I-70 
takes on a rural highway as it leaves Jackson County. The highway remains 
this way for the next 100 miles (160 km), going through gently rolling 
terrain while it meets US 65 at a cloverleaf interchange and finally crossing 
the Missouri River at Rocheport just west of where it reaches the mid-sized 
college town of Columbia in the center of the state.[11] Through Columbia, 
the highway is lined with restaurants and hotels and can get congested 
during University of Missouri sporting events. The highway leaves Columbia 
after an exit with St. Charles Road on the east end of town.[12] East of 
Columbia, I-70 has an interchange with US 54 at Kingdom City, Route 19 
at New Florence, and Route 47 at Warrenton. Then, it continues through 
more gently rolling terrain until it reaches Wentzville, where it meets 
I-64/US 61. Here, US 40 departs from I-70. It then expands to three lanes 
each direction to St. Louis. East of Wentzville, I-70 passes through the 
bedroom community of Lake St. Louis, then the growing towns of O'Fallon 
and St. Peters, and finally the historic city of St. Charles. It crosses 
over the Missouri River one last time on the Blanchette Memorial Bridge, 
which is actually made up of two bridges: the westbound span built in the 
late-1950s and refurbished in 2013 and the eastbound one completed in the 
late-1970s. Traffic volume increases as I-70 enters St. Louis County, requiring 
more lanes. There are as many as 13 lanes at one point. The section of 
I-70 from Fifth Street in St. Charles to I-270 is among the busiest section 
of highway in the state, with AADT counts approaching 165,000 in 2005.[2] 
I-270 draws much of the traffic, so I-70 continues east through Bridgeton 
with only six lanes. After interchanges with Route 180 (St. Charles Rock 
Road) and US 67 (Lindbergh Boulevard), it passes on the southern edge of 
Lambert–St. Louis International Airport and through several bedroom communities – 
including Edmunson, Berkeley, Ferguson, and Jennings – and crossing I-170 
in the process. As it finally enters the city of St. Louis, motorists encounter 
what are signed as the "Express Lanes", known by MoDOT as the "reversible 
lanes".[13] Two lanes in the middle of the freeway are separated from the 
eastbound and westbound lanes by Jersey barriers. Due to traffic pattern 
changes caused by the I-64 reconstruction, the lanes travel eastbound all 
day. MoDOT regularly monitors traffic patterns of this stretch of I-70 
and will adjust the express lane traffic patterns accordingly.[13] These 
lanes have no entrance or exit ramps, except at the ends. They extend approximately 
8 miles (13 km) from near Union Boulevard to just north of downtown. Just 
before the it enters downtown St. Louis, I-70 turns to the east to cross 
the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge, which redirects the highway's 
traffic away from the congested Poplar Street Bridge two miles (3.2 km) 
to the south. The former stretch of I-70 now continues as I-44. I-70 had 
been criticized for cutting off downtown St. Louis from the Mississippi 
River waterfront particularly at the Gateway Arch. St. Louis is considering 
a $90 million project to cover the highway (now I-44) by the Arch.[14] 
This was not the first controversy involving I-70 and the Arch. In 1959, 
builders of the Poplar Street Bridge asked for the National Park Service 
to give 25 acres (10 ha) of the park for the bridge. The request generated 
enormous controversy and ultimately 2.5 acres (1.0 ha) was turned over 
to use for the bridge.[15] The New Mississippi River Bridge was finished 
and opened to traffic on Sunday, February 9, 2014. It reroutes and redirects 
I-70 traffic off the congested Poplar Street Bridge. The bridge was named 
in honor of St. Louis Cardinals baseball legend Stan Musial.[16] I-70 across 
central Missouri is one of the oldest stretches of Interstate Highway in 
the system, as some sections date back as far as the late 1950s.[17] As 
a result, the exits often have short, substandard acceleration and deceleration 
ramps, and the median is relatively narrow. Certain spots of both directions 
of traffic are separated by no more than a Jersey barrier. Also, a number 
of overpasses have low clearance, especially railway overpasses. Long-term 
plans have been identified to expand the highway to between six and eight 
lanes across the middle of the state.[18] Tolling the Interstate has become 
a possible alternative, although the public does not support this idea. 
According to the improveI70.com website, tolling would not start until 
all 189 miles (304 km) of I-70 is reconstructed.[citation needed] A March 
2010 study[19] of I-70 from the Kansas state line to the I-470 interchange 
identified several possible improvements, including expansion of the freeway 
from four to eight lanes, adding HOV or HOT lanes, reconstructing the Truman 
Road interchange and improving the curves at Jackson Avenue and Truman 
Road. Some novel ideas included a new alignment of I-70 as a tunnel from 
the southeast corner of the downtown loop to 22nd/23rd streets, covering 
the southern portion of the downtown loop (I-670) or making the downtown 
loop into a uni-directional freeway around downtown, essentially becoming
