Jeffrey Leonard (born September 22, 1955), nicknamed "Penitentiary Face",[1] 
is an American former left fielder in Major League Baseball with a 14-year 
career from 1977 to 1990. He played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Houston 
Astros, San Francisco Giants, Milwaukee Brewers and Seattle Mariners. Leonard 
was born in Philadelphia. He was a standout in football, basketball and 
baseball at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia, which produced basketball 
stars Wilt Chamberlain and Walt Hazzard. He got 60 scholarship offers for 
football, five for basketball and none for baseball, where he played shortstop 
and twice hit two home runs in one inning. While playing in the minor leagues 
in the middle of the 1981 season Max Venable and Guy Sularz gave Jeffrey 
Leonard the nickname "HackMan"[citation needed] because he had a habit 
of swinging at the first pitch no matter what. People spelled it "Hackman" 
but he did not like the way the spelling looked, and said, "Spell it like 
the video game PacMan", so it came out as "HacMan."[citation needed] Leonard 
was known for his "one flap down" routine: running around the bases after 
hitting a home run with one arm hanging motionless at his side.[2] Leonard 
tied for the California League lead for assists by an outfielder with 13 
while playing for the Bakersfield Dodgers in 1976.[citation needed] He 
also led the Pacific Coast League in hits (183) and batting average (.365) 
while playing for the Albuquerque Dukes in 1978.[citation needed] He was 
selected to the National League All-Star team in 1987[3] and to the American 
League All-Star team in 1989.[4] Jeffrey Leonard's greatest moment as a 
player most likely occurred during the 1987 National League Championship 
Series while with the San Francisco Giants. During the seven game-long 
series against the St. Louis Cardinals, Leonard had five runs, ten hits, 
four home runs, five runs batted in, a batting average of .417, and a slugging 
percentage of .917. For his performance, Leonard was awarded the 1987 NLCS 
Most Valuable Player Award. As of 2015, Jeffrey Leonard is the last person 
to be named the Most Valuable Player of a League Championship Series or 
World Series while a member of the losing team. His four home runs tied 
a record shared by Bob Robertson (1971) and Steve Garvey (1978) for most 
home runs in a League Championship Series. It was also during this NLCS 
that Leonard would draw ire for a "Cadillac" home run trot; the Cardinals 
felt he took a little too much time rounding the bases on his home runs, 
thereby showing up the pitcher. In response to this attitude, and for Leonard's 
repeated "one-flap down" routine of running bases, Cardinals pitcher Bob 
Forsch famously hit Leonard in the back with a fastball in the fifth inning 
of Game 3.[5] The St. Louis press began calling Leonard "both flaps down" 
after the incident.[6] Leonard had a solid career in the majors that included 
a lifetime .266 batting average, 144 home runs, 614 runs scored, and 723 
RBI. During his first season as a starting outfielder, he hit .290 for 
the Houston Astros in 1979. His best season was in 1984 when Leonard hit 
.302 with 21 homers and 86 RBI for the Giants. His best season for power 
came with Seattle in 1989 as the 6-2, 200-pound slugger finished with a 
.254 average along with 24 home runs and 93 RBI.[7] • On August 7, 1984, 
Jeffrey Leonard went a perfect 5-for-5 with 3 RBI and a run scored as his 
San Francisco Giants defeated the Houston Astros at the Astrodome, 9-2.[8] 
• On August 8, 1989, Leonard went 3-for-5 with 2 home runs and 4 RBI as 
his Seattle Mariners knocked off the California Angels 6-4 in 10 innings. 
Leonard and his teammate Darnell Coles both homered in the tenth inning 
as the Mariners' record improved to 54-58 on the season.[9] Leonard was 
one of seven then-current or former major league baseball players who testified 
at the 1985 cocaine trafficking trial of Curtis Strong, which became known 
as the Pittsburgh drug trials.[5][10] Many of the players who testified, 
including Leonard, were given immunity from prosecution in exchange for 
their testimony.[11] Baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth suspended 11 
players on February 28, 1986, including Leonard.[12] Ueberroth interviewed 
the involved players during the off-season at the end of that year, and 
imposed sanctions against players for their apparent involvement in the 
cocaine network. Leonard was among a group of players that Ueberroth cited 
as having had a "prolonged pattern of drug use" and had involvement in 
cocaine distribution; these players were issued one-year suspensions from 
Major League Baseball, however, the suspensions were to be waived in exchange 
for donations to drug-treatment programs, and community service performed 
with drug-related organizations.[13] The donations for many, including 
Leonard, were to amount to 10% of their base salaries (in Leonard's case, 
this amounted to $80,000[14]) and players had to submit to drug testing 
for the rest of their careers.[11] The Pittsburgh drug trials are considered 
one of Major League Baseball's biggest scandals of all time, albeit one 
that was "behind the scenes" and did not affect play on the field.[15] 
Since his retirement, Leonard has coached both in Minor League organizations 
and college baseball. He coached the Antelope Valley College Marauders 
baseball team in 2003 and 2004, where he had a total win-loss record of 
25-44-1.[16] Currently[when?] he teaches students whom are serious about 
furthering their baseball careers to a college level and/or professional 
level.[citation needed] He and his wife Karen reside in Rocklin, California.[citation 
needed] They have seven children between them and enjoy spending time with 
their three grandchildren.[17] Leonard and his wife are currently very 
active in the fight against breast cancer. They started a foundation called 
the One Flap Down Foundation to help single parents going through treatment, 
after Leonard's step-daughter Christine, a single mother of three, was
