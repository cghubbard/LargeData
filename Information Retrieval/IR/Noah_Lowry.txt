Noah Ryan Lowry (born October 10, 1980) is an American former professional 
baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball for the San Francisco 
Giants from 2003 to 2007. Lowry was first drafted out of Nordhoff High 
School, in Ojai, California, by the Texas Rangers in the nineteenth round 
of the 1999 MLB Draft, but instead opted to attend Pepperdine University. 
At Pepperdine, Lowry went 14-2 with a 1.71 ERA as a junior. In 2001, the 
San Francisco Giants drafted Lowry with the 30th and last pick of the first 
round in the 2001 MLB Draft. Following a September call-up in 2003, Lowry 
enjoyed a very successful partial rookie year for the Giants in 2004, going 
6-0, and finishing with a 3.82 ERA in fourteen starts. He was named the 
National League's Player of the Week for the week of August 9. With an 
early victory to start off the 2005 season, Lowry began his career with 
a 7-0 record, the longest winning streak for any pitcher in San Francisco 
Giants history (and the second longest in Giants franchise history, behind 
Hooks Wiltse's 12-0 start in 1904).[1] Lowry got eighteen starts before 
the 2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game and compiled a 2.43 ERA after 
the break. His best month came in August, when he went 5-0 with a 0.69 
ERA, earning him Pitcher of the Month honors. He finished the season with 
a 13-13 record, 3.78 ERA, and 172 strikeouts in 204â…” innings. Prior to 
the 2006 season, the Giants signed Lowry to a four-year deal with an option 
for a fifth year, valued at $9.25 million. At the time, it was the second 
largest contract for a pitcher with only one full season of big league 
service. Lowry received a $1 million signing bonus and $385,000 salary 
for 2006. The contract guaranteed him totals of $1.115 million for 2007, 
$2.25 million for 2008, and $4.5 million for 2009. The contract included 
a 2010 option for $6.25 million that would have been activated automatically 
if a certain number of starts, innings, and Cy Young Award vote placements 
was achieved. The 2010 option also included another $1.5 million in incentives.[2] 
Injuries hampered his performance right from the beginning of the 2006 
season. In his first start of 2006, Lowry was removed from the game in 
the second inning due to an oblique strain,[3] forcing him to miss the 
first month of the season. Lowry also suffered from an elbow injury in 
September. Despite a losing season for the Giants in 2007, and a season 
cut short by a forearm injury, Lowry managed to win a career-high 14 games, 
the most for any pitcher on the Giants staff. He finished the season with 
a 14-8 record and a 3.92 ERA. Lowry was slated as the number three starter 
for the Giants in 2008, but the forearm injury that shut him down in 2007 
kept him out of the 2008 season. After having trouble throwing strikes 
early on in spring training, Lowry was diagnosed with exertional compartment 
syndrome[4] and had surgery on his left forearm on March 7. In September 
2008, he also had an arthroscopic procedure to remove a bone spur from 
his left elbow.[5] In May 2009 Lowry had a rib surgically removed to relieve 
the continued pain in his shoulder and neck associated with his recent 
diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome.[6] The new diagnosis brought the 
original diagnosis of exertional compartment syndrome into question, along 
with the necessity of his 2008 surgery.[7] Lowry's agent, Damon Lapa, claimed 
that the Giants' medical staff had misdiagnosed the injury and subjected 
Lowry to an unnecessary arm operation, turning a potential short-term recovery 
into a lengthy medical ordeal. Lapa said Dr. James Andrews and Dr. Greg 
Pearl confirmed the diagnosis in separate consultations with Lowry. Lapa 
said the circulatory issue was the source of Lowry's forearm tightness 
in August 2007 and loss of control in spring training 2008, but that the 
Giants' medical staff failed to identify the problem. The Giants, however, 
denied any wrongdoing.[5] As of February 2010, Lowry was working out under 
the direction of noted personal trainer Brett Fischer at Fischer Sports 
Physical Therapy & Conditioning in Phoenix.[5] In a February 28, 2013 interview 
on Chronicle Live, Lowry stated, "It doesn't look like baseball is going 
to be in my future," and gave viewers a status update of his still-deteriorating 
health, his young family, his current career as an entrepreneur and ecology 
advocate, and his love for the San Francisco Giants and baseball in general.[8] 
Lowry lives in Santa Rosa, California, with his wife Andrea Montoya Lowry 
and daughters Averlee and Anniston. An avid outdoorsman and sportsman,
