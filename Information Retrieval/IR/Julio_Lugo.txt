Julio Cesar Lugo (born November 16, 1975) is a retired Dominican professional 
baseball shortstop. He bats and throws right-handed. Lugo is the older 
brother of baseball pitcher Ruddy Lugo. Lugo attended Fort Hamilton High 
School in Brooklyn, New York, where he batted .350. He also played sandlot 
baseball for the Youth Service League in Brooklyn, New York whose alumni 
include Manny Ramírez and Shawon Dunston. Lugo starred at Connors State 
College in Warner, Oklahoma He was drafted by the Houston Astros in the 
43rd round of the 1994 amateur draft. He signed with them on May 17, 1995. 
After being released by the Astros in 2003, Lugo was signed by the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays where he hit 15 homeruns during the season, including 4 
homeruns over 4 nights in a 4 game series against the Toronto Blue Jays 
in late September. After spending three seasons with the Devil Rays, he 
was traded at the 2006 trade deadline, to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Joel 
Guzman and Sergio Pedroza.[1] On December 5, 2006, Lugo signed a four-year, 
$36 million contract with the Boston Red Sox.[2] Lugo was brought on to 
bat leadoff, but was moved by manager Terry Francona to the bottom part 
of the order primarily due to his inability to consistently get on base. 
From June 15 to July 3 Lugo went 0–31 from the plate. Since 1996, only 
one other Major League player with more than 250 at bats 80 games into 
the season has had a lower batting average: Greg Vaughn, .163 for the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays in 2002.[3] After the first week of July 2007, Lugo turned 
his hitting performance around, compiling a 14-game hitting streak on July 
25, 2007. He was 24-for-54 (.444) during the career-best streak, raising 
his average from .189 to .226. One of his few bright spots on the season 
was a streak of 20 consecutive stolen bases, a club record. As of July 
5, 2008, Lugo had committed 16 errors, which not only led all big-league 
players, but was also nearly one-third of the 50 errors made by the Red 
Sox as a team. He was hitting .268 with one home run and 22 RBIs. Rookie 
shortstop Jed Lowrie was called up from the Pawtucket Red Sox to fill in 
for Lugo while he was on the Disabled List. On March 17, 2009, Lugo underwent 
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to repair a torn meniscus cartilage. 
Lugo was expected to be out for three to four weeks. Upon his return, Lugo 
got off to a slow start and was on a day-to-day playing rotation with fellow 
shortstop Nick Green.[4] On July 17, 2009, Lugo was designated for assignment 
by the Red Sox, and was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Chris Duncan 
and cash considerations .[5] On April 1, 2010, Lugo was traded to the Baltimore 
Orioles for a player-to-be-named-later.[6] He batted .249 in 241 at-bats, 
playing in 93 games.[7] Lugo signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta 
Braves on May 23, 2011.[8] He had his contract purchased on June 21. On 
July 26, Lugo was involved in a controversial play that ended the game 
in the 19th inning against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Braves and Pirates 
were tied at 3. There were runners on the corners. Lugo was on third. Scott 
Proctor hit a grounder to Pedro Alvarez. Alvarez threw quickly to Michael 
McKenry, who tagged Lugo. However, home plate umpire Jerry Meals called 
Lugo safe, which allowed him to score the game-winning run. As the Braves 
were celebrating, Clint Hurdle argued the call. The Braves released him 
on September 2, 2011. On January 21, 2012, Lugo agreed to a minor league 
contract with the Cleveland Indians with an invitation to Spring training.[9] 
The deal later fell apart and he remained a free agent. Lugo came out of 
retirement and played for the Peoria Explorers of the independent Freedom 
Pro League in 2013.[10] Lugo and his wife Mabely have two sons: Josmael 
Aquiles and Julio Alejandro. The family splits the offseason between homes 
in Houston and the Dominican Republic. On April 30, 2003 Lugo was arrested 
outside of Minute Maid Park and charged with "hitting his wife in the face 
and slamming her head on a car hood". He was formally charged with misdemeanor 
assault, and if convicted, Lugo would have faced up to one year in jail 
and a $4,000 fine. His wife was treated and released from an area hospital 
while Lugo spent the night in jail and then paid $50,000 for his release 
on bond. On Thursday May 1, 2003 the Houston Astros designated him for
