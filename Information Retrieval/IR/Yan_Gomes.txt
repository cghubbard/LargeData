his first season with Tennessee, he was named an NCAA Division I Freshman 
All-American.[3] Gomes was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 39th round 
of the 2008 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, but he did not sign.[4]

began to receive playing time at first base and third base as well, as 
he sat behind top catching prospect Travis d'Arnaud in the organization's 
depth chart.[3] After batting .359 (47-for-131) with five home runs and 
22 RBI at the start of the 2012 season with Las Vegas, Gomes was promoted

Blue Jays active roster on September 7 after the Las Vegas 51s season ended.[16] 
On November 3, 2012, the Blue Jays announced that they had traded Gomes 
and Mike Aviles to the Cleveland Indians for Esmil Rogers.[17] The Indians 
recalled Gomes from the Triple-A Columbus Clippers on April 9, 2013.[18]
