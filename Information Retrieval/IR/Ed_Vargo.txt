Edward Paul Vargo (September 17, 1928 – February 2, 2008) was an American 
umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the National League from 
1960 to 1983. He officiated in the World Series, National League Championship 
Series and All-Star Game four times each, and also worked a number of other 
historic games. His 3,554 total games ranked ninth in NL history when he 
retired. During most of his career, Vargo wore uniform number 20. Vargo, 
of Hungarian and Ukrainian descent,[1] was born the youngest son of Alex 
and Mary Vargo in the Pittsburgh suburb of Butler, Pennsylvania,[2] where 
he continued to live throughout his life. In his youth he worked as a batboy 
and equipment manager with the Butler Yankees of the Class-D Pennsylvania 
State Association. After briefly playing as a catcher in the St. Louis 
Cardinals system, he served five years in the Army, where he began umpiring,[2] 
and began his professional career in the Georgia–Florida League (1953–54, 
1956), Piedmont League (1955), Eastern League (1957) and International 
League (1957–59).[3] In his second year in the NL, he was rated the neatest 
umpire in the league in a Sporting News poll of writers, managers and coaches.[4] 
He married Elizabeth Joan (Betty) Hunter on February 9, 1963;[3] they had 
four children, sons Edward and David and daughters Karen and Kristin.[2] 
Vargo officiated in the World Series in 1965, 1971, 1978 and 1983, serving 
as crew chief in 1978. He worked the NLCS in 1969 (the first-ever NLCS), 
1973, 1976 and 1980, and the All-Star Game in 1961 (first game), 1966, 
1974 and 1981. He was the home plate umpire for Game 4 of the 1971 World 
Series, the Fall Classic's first night game. He officiated in eight no-hitters, 
calling three of them from behind the plate: Don Nottebart's 4-1 win for 
the Houston Colt .45s over the Philadelphia Phillies on May 17, 1963;[5] 
Sandy Koufax's record-tying third no-hitter on June 4, 1964, a 3-0 Los 
Angeles Dodgers win over the Phillies;[6] and Koufax's perfect game on 
September 9, 1965, a 1-0 win over the Chicago Cubs.[7] Vargo is the only 
umpire to call no-hitters in three consecutive seasons, and one of only 
two umpires to call a no-hitter and perfect game by the same pitcher. (Eric 
Cooper has since joined him, calling balls and strikes for Mark Buehrle's 
two no-hitters; the perfect game was the latter of the two.) Vargo was 
also behind the plate on April 4, 1974 when Hank Aaron tied Babe Ruth's 
record of 714 career home runs. The jacket he wore for Koufax's perfect 
game, Aaron's record-tying game and the first World Series night game in 
1971 was donated to the Baseball Hall of Fame by amateur umpire Ray Gouley, 
to whom Vargo had given it, once Gouley learned of its significance.[8] 
After retiring from umpiring, Vargo became a National League supervisor 
until 1997; he was inducted into the Western Pennsylvania Sports Hall of 
Fame in 1994.[2] He died at his home in Butler at age 79, and was buried
