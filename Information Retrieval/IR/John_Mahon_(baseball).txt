John J. Mahon was a politician and professional baseball executive. He 
served as president and principal owner of the Baltimore Orioles of the 
American League in 1902. He was also a notable political boss in Baltimore, 
Maryland, affiliated with the Democratic Party. Mahon succeeded Sydney 
Frank as team president of the American League's (AL) Baltimore Orioles 
in 1902.[1] Baltimore's owners felt that AL president Ban Johnson was hurting 
the team's fortunes. When John McGraw left the Orioles for the New York 
Giants of the National League (NL), Mahon and his co-owners supported McGraw.[2] 
In the meantime, Mahon purchased McGraw's shares in the Orioles.[3] With 
the team in financial straits, reportedly owing $12,000 ($328,754 in current 
dollar terms),[4][5] Mahon purchased shares in the team from players John 
McGraw, Joe Kelley, and Wilbert Robinson, becoming principal shareholder 
of the Orioles.[4] Mahon then sold controlling interest in the Orioles 
to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal 
owner of the Cincinnati Reds, on July 17.[4] In the day they owned the 
franchise, Freedman released the best players on the Orioles from their 
contracts so that they could be signed by National League teams: Kelley 
and Cy Seymour signed with the Reds, while McGraw, Joe McGinnity, Roger 
Bresnahan, Dan McGann, and Jack Cronin signed with the Giants.[6][7] Johnson, 
along with Orioles minority owners, took control of the Orioles franchise, 
which had to forfeit their game that day as they did not have enough players.[4][8] 
Mahon was a political boss associated with the Democratic Party.[9][10] 
Mahon was elected to the Baltimore City Council in 1916.[11] He was considered 
a Democratic political leader of Baltimore later in his career.[12] Mahon
