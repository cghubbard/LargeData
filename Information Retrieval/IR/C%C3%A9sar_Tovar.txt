César Leonardo Tovar (July 3, 1940 – July 14, 1994), nicknamed "Pepito" 
and "Mr. Versatility", was a Venezuelan professional baseball player.[1] 
He played in Major League Baseball for the Minnesota Twins (1965–72), Philadelphia 
Phillies (1973), Texas Rangers (1974–1975), Oakland Athletics (1975–1976) 
and New York Yankees (1976).[1] Tovar was an extremely versatile player 
capable of playing various defensive positions on the field. He was the 
second player in major league history to play all nine positions during 
a single game.[2] Tovar also had a prolific career in the Venezuelan Winter 
League where he played 26 seasons, second only to the 30 seasons played 
by Vic Davalillo.[3] Tovar was born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela where 
as a child, he shined shoes to earn extra income for his family.[3] At 
the age of 15, he befriended Gus Gil, another Venezuelan who went on to 
play in Major League Baseball.[3] In January 1959, Cincinnati Reds General 
Manager, Gabe Paul, attempted to sign Gil to a contract however, Gil insisted 
that Paul should also have Tovar sign a contract. Paul relented in order 
to make Gil agree to sign.[3] Tovar began his professional baseball career 
when he was assigned to the Geneva Redlegs in the D-league New York–Penn 
League. He hit .252 in 87 games as an infielder for Geneva in 1959.[4] 
That winter, he returned to Venezuela to play for the Leones del Caracas, 
and won the league's rookie of the year award.[3] In 1960, he played with 
the Missoula Timberjacks of the Pioneer League where he produced a promising 
.304 batting average along with 12 home runs and 68 runs batted in.[4] 
After being selected to the league's All-Star team, he was rewarded by 
getting to play two games at the top level of the Reds' minor league system 
with the Seattle Rainiers.[3] Tovar was sent back to Geneva in 1961, where 
he batted .338 with 19 home runs and 78 runs batted in.[4] He stole 88 
bases in 100 attempts to lead the league while setting a new league record 
for stolen bases.[3] In 1962, he played for the Rocky Mount Leafs of the 
Carolina League, and led the league in batting with a .329 batting average 
along with 10 home runs and 78 runs batted in.[5] The Reds had a promising 
second baseman in Pete Rose, who would win the 1963 National League Rookie 
of the Year Award, and with second basemen Bobby Klaus and Gus Gil in their 
minor league system, there was little room left for Tovar to progress.[3] 
The Reds sent him on loan to play for the Minnesota Twins minor league 
affiliate, the Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers.[4] In 1964, Tovar returned to 
the Reds organization, where he played for the San Diego Padres of the 
Pacific Coast League.[4] He helped the Padres win the league championship 
by hitting for a .275 with 7 home runs and 52 runs batted in, while playing 
as a third baseman, shortstop, second baseman, and as an outfielder.[4] 
Before the start of the 1965 season, the Twins traded pitcher Gerry Arrigo 
to the Reds for Tovar.[1] The Twins had originally sought to get Tommy 
Helms from the Reds, but they refused to trade him and the Twins settled 
for Tovar.[3] At the age of 24, Tovar made his major league debut on April 
12, 1965, becoming the ninth Venezuelan to play in Major League Baseball.[1][3] 
However he would soon be sent back to the minor leagues with the Denver 
Bears, where he hit for a .328 average. Tovar received a September call-up 
and played in a total of 18 games in the season however, he would be left 
off the post-season roster and would watch the Twins' seven-game World 
Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers from home.[3] Starting in 1966, 
the Twins would make ample use of Tovar's ability to play a variety of 
positions. In 1967, he would divide his fielding season between third base 
(70 games), center field (64), second baseman (36), left field (10), shortstop 
(9) and right field (5), setting an American League record of 164 games 
played (the Twins had two tie games in the 1967 season) and leading the 
league with 726 plate appearances and 649 at-bats.[6] He was also among 
the top 10 batters in runs, hits, doubles, triples, stolen bases, hit by 
pitch and sacrifice hits.[6] The Twins were in first place with two games 
left in the 1967 season, but lost their final two games to the Boston Red 
Sox and finished the season in second place.[7] At the end of the 1967 
season, the Triple Crown winner, Carl Yastrzemski, received all but one 
vote for the American League Most Valuable Player Award; the lone dissenting 
ballot (cast by Minneapolis Star sports writer Max Nichols) was marked 
in favor of Tovar who would finish 7th in the MVP voting.[8] On September 
22, 1968, Tovar became the second player after Bert Campaneris (Kansas 
City Athletics, 1965) to play all nine fielding positions in a game. The 
two were later joined by Scott Sheldon (Texas Rangers, 2000) and Shane 
Halter (Detroit Tigers, 2000) as the only four players in MLB history to 
have accomplished the feat.[2][9][10][11] Tovar started the game on the 
mound against Oakland and pitched one scoreless inning in which he struck 
out Reggie Jackson. As fate would have it, the first batter he faced was 
Campaneris. On May 18, 1969, Tovar combined with Rod Carew to set a major 
league record for most steals by a club in one inning with five. In the 
third inning against a Detroit battery of Mickey Lolich and Bill Freehan, 
Tovar stole third base and home. Carew followed by stealing second base, 
third base and home.[11][12] The two steals of home in the same inning 
also tied a record. In 1970, Tovar ended the season with a .300 batting 
average, ranked third in the league in total hits with 195, and second 
in runs scored with 120.[13] The Twins won the American League Western 
Division title in both 1969 and 1970, but each time were swept in three 
games by the Baltimore Orioles during the play-offs. Tovar hit for only 
a .077 batting average in the 1969 American League Championship Series, 
but improved with a .385 average in the 1970 American League Championship 
Series.[14] As he improved at the plate, Tovar also moved less around the 
diamond – playing primarily center field in 1970, left field in 1971, and 
right field in 1972. He improved his hitting through 1971, when he hit 
for a .311 batting average and led the league with 204 hits.[15] In 1971, 
SPORT magazine polled major league players to identify the game's most 
competitive player. Pete Rose won; the runners-up were Frank Robinson, 
Bob Gibson, and César Tovar. On September 19, 1972, Tovar belted a walk-off 
home run to hit for the cycle.[16] Only four other players in major league 
baseball history have completed a cycle with a game-ending homer: Ken Boyer 
(1961),[17] George Brett (1979),[18] Dwight Evans (1984)[19] and Carlos 
González (2010).[20] After a subpar season in 1972, the Twins traded Tovar 
on November 30 to the Philadelphia Phillies for first baseman/outfielder 
Joe Lis and pitchers Ken Reynolds and Ken Sanders.[21] Tovar would then 
spend the 1973 season platooning with a young Mike Schmidt at third base. 
After being purchased by the Texas Rangers in December 1973, Tovar had 
a brief resurgence in 1974 as the leadoff hitter for Billy Martin, his 
Twins manager in 1970, hitting .292 with a .354 on-base percentage.[1] 
In August 1975, the Rangers sold Tovar's contract to the Oakland Athletics 
who were in first place in the American League Western Division. The Athletics 
won the division title and Tovar appeared in two games of the 1975 American 
League Championship Series, getting one hit in two at-bats and scoring 
two runs.[14] He was a pinch hitter and defensive replacement for the Athletics 
in 1976, before breaking his wrist while making a diving catch on May 31.[3] 
He was activated in mid-August, only after a complaint from the Major League 
Baseball Players Association.[3] The Athletics' temperamental owner, Charlie 
Finley, then released Tovar on August 25.[3] The New York Yankees purchased 
his contract on September 1, 1976, and he appeared in 13 games for them 
before playing in his final major league game on September 29, 1976, at 
the age of 35.[1] The Yankees released him in December 1976.[1] In his 
twelve-year major league career, Tovar played in 1,448 games with 1,546 
hits in 5,569 at bats for a .278 batting average along with 46 home runs, 
435 RBI, 834 runs, 253 doubles, 55 triples, 226 stolen bases and a .335 
on-base percentage.[1][22][23] Along with Eddie Milner, Tovar is regarded 
as the major league's all-time leader in breaking up no-hit attempts with 
five.[11][24][25] On April 30, 1967, Tovar's single was the only hit against 
the Washington Senators' Barry Moore.[26] On May 15, 1969, he broke up 
the no-hit bid of Baltimore pitcher, Dave McNally.[27] Later that same 
season on August 10, 1969, Mike Cuellar of the Baltimore Orioles extended 
his streak of consecutive batters retired to 35 before surrendering a ninth-inning 
single to Tovar, which also broke up Cuellar's bid for a no-hitter.[28] 
Tovar was responsible for spoiling two other no-hitters during his career: 
against the Washington's Dick Bosman (August 13, 1970) and the Yankees' 
Jim "Catfish" Hunter (May 31, 1975).[29][30] After retiring from the major 
leagues, Tovar played in the Mexican League in 1977 and 1978. In 1979, 
Tovar played in the short-lived Inter-American League for the Caracas Metropolitanos 
and hit .285 for manager Jim Busby.[3] He also continued to play in the 
Venezuelan Winter League. He was a player-coach for the Águilas del Zulia 
team that won the 1984 league championship before going on to win the 1984 
Caribbean Series. He retired as a player at the age of 45 after two final 
games in the winter of 1985–86. In August 1990, he managed the Venezuelan 
team to a 1–7 last place finish in the Baseball World Cup, which was held 
in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.[31] César Tovar died on July 14, 1994 of 
pancreatic cancer in Caracas, Venezuelan Capital District, Venezuela, at 
54 years of age.[32] Tovar was inducted into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall
