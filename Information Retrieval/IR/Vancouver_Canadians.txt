The Vancouver Canadians are a minor league baseball team based in Vancouver, 
British Columbia. The Canadians are the Northwest League affiliate of the 
Toronto Blue Jays. The C's have previously affiliated with the Oakland 
Athletics between 2000–2010. They are the only Canadian team in the "affiliated" 
minor leagues—i.e., part of the farm system of a Major League Baseball 
team. This came about after the Ottawa Lynx moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania. 
The NWL Canadians supplanted a Triple-A franchise of the same name that 
played for 22 seasons (1978–99) in the Pacific Coast League. The current 
incarnation of the Canadians was established in 2000 after the AAA Canadians 
moved to West Sacramento, California and became the Sacramento River Cats 
(which is now an affiliate of the San Francisco Giants). As a Northwest 
League franchise (dating back to 1979 in Medford, Oregon), the Canadians 
have had players such as José Canseco, Pat Britt, Rod Beck, Rickey Henderson, 
Scott Brosius, Jason Giambi, Tim Hudson, Nick Swisher, Jeremy Brown, Troy 
Glaus, Sammy Sosa, Jason Windsor, Joe Blanton, Rich Harden, Travis Buck, 
local Sean Triplett, Danny Putnam, Dallas Braden and Miguel Tejada. The 
team formed after Medford, Oregon's Southern Oregon Timberjacks relocated 
to Vancouver. Vancouver was a heavy player in the early history of the 
Northwest League, a charter member in every version of the league that 
would eventually form the NWL, notably as the sole team that survived the 
collapse of the Western International League in 1922 when it reformed in 
1937, winning four pennants in the WIL (1942, 1947, 1949, 1954) as the 
Vancouver Capilanos (1939–1954). However, even though they were the final 
champions of the WIL, Vancouver was not part of its reformation into the 
Northwest League, due to the NWL's shedding of all of its Canadian teams 
in order to focus on the American Pacific Northwest. Vancouver was without 
professional baseball in 1955, but in 1956 the highest calibre of minor 
league play, in the form of the Open-Classification Pacific Coast League, 
came to British Columbia when Oakland Oaks transferred there as the Vancouver 
Mounties. The Mounties played in the PCL from 1956 through 1962, and from 
1965 through 1969. A Triple-A franchise named the Vancouver Canadians played 
for 22 seasons (1978–99) in the Pacific Coast League at Nat Bailey Stadium. 
Following the 1999 season, in which they won the Triple-A World Series, 
the team was purchased by a group led by Art Savage and moved to Sacramento, 
California for the 2000 season and became the Sacramento River Cats. The 
Canadians announced January 10, 2007 that Rick Magnante would return as 
Manager for 2007, as well as pitching coach Craig Lefferts, who entered 
his 4th season as the pitching coach. Former Vancouver Canadian slugger 
Chris Pritchett was named the team's latest hitting coach in May 2007. 
In 2007, local Vancouver businessmen, Jake Kerr and Jeff Mooney purchased 
the Vancouver Canadians and secured a 25-year lease with the City of Vancouver 
Parks Board. Extensive work began that offseason in a full-scale stadium 
renovation which improved washrooms, concessions, concourses, and Children's 
Play Area. Point-of-purchase concessions increased substantially. The Canadians 
announced that former Washington Nationals executive Andy Dunn would become 
the President and General Manager of the Canadians, on January 7, 2008. 
In the spring of 2010, the Vancouver Canadians and Scotiabank announced 
a long-term partnership that would see Nat Bailey Stadium renamed to Scotiabank 
Field at Nat Bailey Stadium. In the fall of 2010, the Canadians became 
the Short Season A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays. This helped see 
the team's attendance rise to 162,162 for the season, a team record. In 
September 2011, the Vancouver Canadians won their first Northwest League 
Championship title, defeating the Tri-City Dust Devils 9-2 to win the final 
series 2-1. The following year, the Vancouver Canadians became back-to-back 
champions for the first time in franchise history, defeating the Boise 
Hawks 12-9 to win the final series 2-1. On January 25, 2013, the Blue Jays 
announced that the player development contract with the Canadians had been 
extended to include the 2016 season.[1] In August 2013, outfielder Kevin 
Pillar became the first alumnus of the team to play in the major leagues 
for Toronto.[2] On September 9, 2013 the Canadians became just the third 
Northwest League team to win three straight championships, defeating the 
Boise Hawks 5-0 at Scotiabank Field at Nat Bailey Stadium to win the final 
series 2-1 in front of a sold out crowd.[3] The 2013 season also saw the 
Vancouver Canadians draw over 195,000 fans to Scotiabank Field, a fifth 
consecutive team record which included 23 sold out games. On November 4, 
2013, the Vancouver Canadians were named the 2013 recipient of the John 
H. Johnson President’s Trophy. The prestigious award is given to minor-league 
baseball’s top organization. It was the first time that a Canadian-based 
franchise won minor league baseball's most prized award.[4] The Blue Jays 
extended their player-development contract with the Canadians through the 
2018 season in early 2016.[5] Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders
