Ival Richard Goodman (July 23, 1908 in Northview, Missouri – November 25, 
1984) was an All-Star right fielder in Major League Baseball who played 
for the Cincinnati Reds (1935–1942) and Chicago Cubs (1943–1944). Goodman, 
who batted left-handed and threw right-handed, helped lead the Reds to 
a National League pennant in 1939 and a World Series title in 1940, and 
he was elected to the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1959. The Cincinnati 
Reds purchased Goodman from the St. Louis Cardinals on November 3, 1934 
for $25,000. The decision paid immediate dividends. In his first season 
in the majors, Goodman appeared in 148 games, hitting .269 with 12 home 
runs and 72 runs batted in. Goodman also scored 86 runs and led the league 
with 18 triples. He led the league again the following season with 14 triples. 
Goodman remained a fixture in the Reds lineup in the following years. In 
1938 he set a since-broken Reds record with 30 home runs, which was second 
only to Mel Ott's 36 that season, while scoring 103 runs (fourth in the 
NL) and driving in 92 (eighth in the NL). He was named to the NL All-Star 
team that season. In the Reds' pennant-winning 1939 season, Goodman hit 
a career-high .323 (sixth best in the NL) and was again named to the NL 
All-Star team. He also hit .333 in the World Series that year, but the 
Reds lost to the New York Yankees in an eventual four-game sweep. The Reds 
rebounded in 1940, posting 100 wins for the first time in club history 
and winning their first World Series title since 1919, in what would be 
Goodman's final season as an everyday player. He hit .258 that year with 
12 home runs and 78 runs scored. He also drove in five runs in the World 
Series that season. Goodman appeared in just 42 games in 1941 and 87 games 
in 1942, and on November 14, 1942, the Chicago Cubs purchased him from 
the Reds. He hit .320 in 80 games for the Cubs in 1943, but appeared in 
just 62 games the following season, which would be his last in the majors.
