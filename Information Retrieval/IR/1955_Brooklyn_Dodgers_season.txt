In 1955, the Brooklyn Dodgers finally fulfilled the promise of many previous 
Dodger teams. Although the club had won several pennants in the past, and 
had won as many as 105 games in 1953, it had never won a World Series. 
This team finished 13.5 games ahead in the National League pennant race, 
leading the league in both runs scored and fewest runs allowed. In the 
1955 World Series, they finally beat their crosstown rivals, the New York 
Yankees. It was the Dodgers first and only World Series championship won 
while located in Brooklyn. This season was basically a culmination of the 
careers of many legendary Dodger players. Catcher Roy Campanella won the 
1955 National League Most Valuable Player award, his third in five years. 
Center fielder Duke Snider led the league in runs batted in and was second 
in the MVP voting. He also hit his 200th career home run on May 10. Jackie 
Robinson and Pee Wee Reese, both 36 years old, could still play. Gil Hodges, 
31, hit 27 home runs (and drove in both Dodger runs in the seventh game 
of the Series), while Carl Furillo, 33, hit 26 home runs with a .314 batting 
average. The pitching staff was anchored by Don Newcombe, who was 20–5. 
It was the first time a black pitcher had won 20 games in a season. The 
22-year-old Johnny Podres was only 9–10 but became the hero of the 1955 
World Series by shutting out the Yankees in the seventh game. Duke Snider 
finished second to teammate Campanella in the MVP voting by just five points, 
226–221, with each man receiving eight first place votes. The voting then 
as now was conducted by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Each 
voting member, one from each major league city, filled out a ballot selecting 
ten men. A player receiving a first place vote got 14 points, 9 points 
for second, and then values of 8–7–6–5–4–3–2–1 for those in places 3 through 
10. A writer from Philadelphia who was sick and who had become hospitalized 
had turned in a ballot with Campanella listed in position number 1 as well 
as position number 5. The assumption had been that the writer had meant 
to write Snider's name into one of those slots. Unable to get a clarification 
from the ill writer the BBWAA, after considering disallowing the ballot, 
decided to accept it, count the first place vote for Campanella and count 
the fifth place vote as though it were left blank. Had the ballot been 
disallowed, the vote would have been won by Snider by three points. Had 
Snider gotten the fifth place vote, the final vote would have favored Snider 
227–226. Duke did, however, win the Sporting News National League Player 
of the Year Award for 1955 and the Sid Mercer Award.[4][5] [1] [2] [3]
