Robert Anton Grim (March 8, 1930 – October 23, 1996) was a pitcher in Major 
League Baseball.[1] Born in New York City, he was signed as an amateur 
free agent by the New York Yankees in 1948. His Major League debut was 
on April 18, 1954 for the Yankees. He wore uniform number 55 for the Yankees 
during his entire period on the team. He won 20 games (the first Yankee 
rookie to win 20 since 1910) and lost only 6 that year, with a 3.26 earned 
run average, and was voted American League Rookie of the Year, with 15 
votes out of 24. He played in two World Series for the Yankees, in 1955 
(against the Brooklyn Dodgers) and in 1957 (against the Milwaukee Braves). 
By 1957, because of arm troubles, he became an exclusive relief pitcher. 
He has been retroactively listed as leading the American League in saves 
in 1957 with 19. (At the time, saves were not a regularly calculated statistic.) 
Grim got the final out of the 1957 All-Star Game, being brought in from 
the bullpen with the American League leading 6–5 and getting pinch-hitter 
Gil Hodges on a game-ending fly out to left field. On June 15, 1958, Grim 
was traded, along with Harry Simpson, by the New York Yankees to the Kansas 
City Athletics for Duke Maas and Virgil Trucks. He had records of 7–6 and 
6–10 for the Athletics the next two seasons. He played with three teams 
in 1960. On April 5, 1960, he was traded by Kansas City to the Cleveland 
Indians for Leo Kiely. On May 18, the Cincinnati Reds purchased his contract 
from Cleveland, and on July 29, the St. Louis Cardinals purchased his contract 
from Cincinnati. Grim was released by the Cardinals before the 1962 season, 
but on April 9, 1962 he was signed as a free agent with the Kansas City 
Athletics. His final MLB game was played on May 24, and the A's released
