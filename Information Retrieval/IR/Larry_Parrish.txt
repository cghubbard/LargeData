As player As manager Larry Alton Parrish (born November 10, 1953) is a 
former Major League Baseball third baseman and manager. Parrish played 
with the Montreal Expos (1974–81), Texas Rangers (1982–88) and Boston Red 
Sox (1988). He also played two seasons in Japan, for the Yakult Swallows 
(1989) and the Hanshin Tigers (1990). He also served as manager of the 
Detroit Tigers (1998–99). Making his debut in 1974 at the age of 20, Parrish 
became a solid hitter as a third baseman in the 1970s and 1980s, hitting 
20 or more home runs in a season five times during his major league career. 
He was a two-time All-Star, and in 1979 was named the Montreal Expos Player 
of the Year after batting .307 with 30 homers and 82 runs batted in. Larry 
is the only Montreal Expo to ever hit 3 home runs in one game on three 
separate occasions (May 29, 1977 – July 30, 1978 – April 25, 1980). In 
the May 1977 game against the Cardinals, he went 5 for 5 batting in 5 runs 
in a 14-4 victory. In the April 1980 game, he drove in all 7 runs for Montreal 
in an 8-7 loss against Atlanta. Parrish ranks seventh on the Texas Rangers 
all-time home run list (149) and eighth in RBIs at 522. He closed out his 
American Major League career by joining the Boston Red Sox during the stretch 
run of the 1988 season, in which the team won the American League Eastern 
Division championship. After his Major League Baseball career ended, Parrish 
played for two different Japanese major league teams. Parrish had a career 
.263 batting average in Major League Baseball with 256 home runs and 992 
runs batted in. In 13 career playoff games, he batted .182 with no home 
runs and three RBIs. After retiring from the majors and spending time playing 
for the Yakult Swallows and Hanshin Tigers of the Japanese Central League, 
Parrish became a full-time coach within the Detroit Tigers organization. 
In 1992, Parrish was named the manager for the Single-A Niagara Falls of 
the New York–Penn League, and won the league championship in 1993. In 1995 
he was named the roving hitting instructor for the Tigers minor league 
system. In 1996, he returned to the dugout as the manager of the Double-A 
Jacksonville Suns, where he won another League Championship the same year. 
Parrish then served as bench coach under manager Buddy Bell for the 1997 
season and part of the 1998 before Bell was fired. Parrish was promoted 
as the replacement, and managed the Tigers from 1998–99, compiling an 82–104 
record, but was replaced by Phil Garner for the 2000 season. Parrish managed 
the Tigers through their final season at Tiger Stadium. Parrish remained 
in the Tigers organization as a scout from 2000–2002, and in 2003 he returned 
to the dugout once again as the manager for the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens 
of the International League. In 2005, Parrish managed the Mud Hens to an 
impressive 89–55 record and the Governors' Cup as champions of the International 
League. The Mud Hens defeated the Indianapolis Indians. Following the season, 
Parrish was named the 2005 Minor League Manager of the Year by The Sporting 
News. In 2006, Parrish led the Mud Hens to a 76–66 record and a repeat 
of the Governor's Cup, giving the Mud Hens their third title and making 
them back to back champions for the first time in team history. This time, 
the Mud Hens defeated the Rochester Red Wings. The team moved on to play 
in the first Triple-A Baseball National Championship Game, in Oklahoma 
City, where they would take on the Tucson Sidewinders of the Pacific Coast 
League. The Mud Hens fell to the Sidewinders by a score of 5–2. On October 
29, 2010, it was announced that Parrish would become the hitting coach 
for the Atlanta Braves, replacing Terry Pendleton, who was moved to first 
base coach. After the Braves offense went from first in the National League 
in On-base percentage in 2010 to fourteenth in 2011 with roughly the same 
lineup, Braves general manager Frank Wren announced on September 30, 2011 
that Parrish would not return to his duties for the 2012 season.[1] Parrish 
was named manager of the West Michigan Whitecaps for the 2013 season. Parrish 
was elected to the International League Hall of Fame as a manager in 2013.[2]
