The Washington Potomacs were a Negro league baseball team in the Eastern 
Colored League, based in Washington, D.C., in 1924.[1] They also operated 
as an independent team in 1923.[2][3] In 1925 the Potomacs moved to Wilmington, 
Delaware where they played as the Wilmington Potomacs for the 1925 season.[4] 
In mid-July, George Robinson, owner of the Potomacs, announced that his 
team was folding and was unable to complete the season. The league contracted 
to seven teams and the Potomacs players were dispersed to other teams.[5]
