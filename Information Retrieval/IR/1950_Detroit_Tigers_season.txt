The 1950 Detroit Tigers had a record of 95–59 (.617), the seventh-best 
winning percentage in the Tigers' 107-year history. After a tight back-and-forth 
pennant race, they finished in second place, three games behind a Yankees 
team that swept the Phillies in the 1950 World Series. The 1950 Tigers 
outscored their opponents 837 to 713, had the second best team ERA in the 
American League and scored the third most runs of the eight American League 
teams. The Tigers' home attendance of 1,951,474 was the second highest 
in the major leagues, trailing only the Yankees. The 1950 team was led 
by: third baseman George Kell, who was second in the American League in 
batting with a .340 average, finished 4th in the AL MVP voting and led 
the major leagues with 218 hits and 56 doubles; center fielder Hoot Evers 
who had a .323 batting average, 109 RBIs, and led American League outfielders 
in fielding percentage (.997) with one error in over 325 chances; right 
fielder Vic Wertz who had 27 home runs, 123 RBIs, and a .408 on-base percentage; 
and pitcher Art Houtteman who had a record of 19–12 with a 3.54 ERA (Adjusted 
ERA+ of 132), 21 complete games and four shutouts. The Tigers spent most 
of the season in first place but lost the pennant in the last two weeks 
of the season to the Yankees. The Tigers got off to a hot start and were 
in first place from Opening Day until May 18, 1950, when the Yankees edged 
ahead. The Tigers retook first place on June 10, 1950 and remained there 
for most of the summer until August 30, 1950, leading by as much as 4½ 
games. The month of September saw one of the tightest pennant races in 
history as the Yankees and Tigers exchanged the first place eight times 
in the final month. The Tigers’ loss of 5 of 6 game to the Cleveland Indians 
in the last two weeks of the season helped the Yankees take the pennant 
by three games. The 1950 Tigers' winning percentage ranks as the 7th best 
in team history. Catching duties were split between Aaron Robinson (.226 
batting average in 107 games), Bob Swift (.227 average in 67 games), and 
Joe Ginsberg (.232 average in 36 games). On September 24, 1950, with the 
Tigers in the middle of a tight pennant race with the Yankees, Robinson 
became the "goat." Heavy smoke from a Canadian forest fire forced the Indians 
to turn on the lights for a Sunday afternoon game against the Indians. 
With the game tied 1–1, Cleveland pitcher Bob Lemon opened the 10th inning 
with a triple, and two intentional walks followed. With the bases loaded 
and one out, Robinson thought he could force out Lemon by stepping on the 
plate without tagging him. Because of the haze, he did not see first baseman 
Don Kolloway remove the force after fielding the ball. Robinson's mental 
lapse cost Detroit the game, and he was blamed for squelching the Tigers' 
pennant hopes.[citation needed] First base duties for the 1950 Tigers were 
split between Don Kolloway, who hit .289 and had a career-high 62 RBIs, 
and Dick Kryhoski, who hit .219 with 19 RBIs. Second baseman Jerry Priddy 
played in a career and AL high 157 games in 1950, all at second base. He 
hit .277 with a .376 on-base percentage, 13 home runs, 75 RBIs, and was 
among the AL leaders with 104 runs scored (10th), 95 walks (7th), 126 singles 
(7th), 253 times on base (10th), 13 sacrifice hits (6th), 618 at bats (4th), 
22 time grounded into a double play (5th), and 95 strikeouts (2nd). Priddy 
also led AL second basemen in 1950 with 542 assists and 150 double plays. 
He finished 17th in the 1950 AL MVP voting. Shortstop Johnny Lipon played 
for the Tigers from 1942 to 1952, though he missed 3½ years to the war. 
In 1950, Lipon hit .293 with a .378 on-base percentage, scored 104 runs, 
walked 88 times, and had 63 RBIs. Lipon also led AL shortstops in 1950 
with 483 assists and 126 double plays. In 1951, Lipon scored a run in Bob 
Feller's third career no-hitter, when he reached on an error, stole second 
base, advanced to third on an errant pickoff throw, and scored on a sacrifice 
fly. Third baseman George Kell had a tremendous season for the 1950 Tigers. 
He was second in the AL in batting with a .340 batting average, played 
in the All Star game, and was 4th in the AL MVP voting. He also led the 
league in hits (218), doubles (56), runs created (124), games (157), and 
at bats (641), and was among the league leaders with 310 total bases (4th), 
114 runs (5th), 285 times on base (3rd), 148 singles (2nd), and 35.6 at 
bats per strikeout (2nd). Kell was inducted into the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame and Museum in 1983. Right fielder Vic Wertz played for the 
Tigers from 1947 to 1952 and again from 1961 to 1963. In 1950, he hit .308 
and was among the AL leaders with a .408 on-base percentage (9th), .533 
slugging percentage (6th), 123 RBIs (4th), 37 doubles (2nd), 120 runs created 
(4th), 27 home runs (9th), 172 hits (9th), 68 extra base hits (5th), 298 
total bases (8th), 91 walks (10th), 267 times on base (10th), and 20.7 
at bats per home run (7th). He finished 10th in the AL MVP voting. Wertz 
is remembered as the batter who hit the 450-foot fly ball that Willie Mays 
caught in the 1954 World Series, a play that has become known as "The Catch." 
Center fielder Hoot Evers also had a big year for the 1950 Tigers. He was 
selected for the All Star team, hit for the cycle on September 7, 1950, 
led the AL with 11 triples, finished 11th in the AL MVP voting, and was 
among the AL leaders with a .551 slugging percentage (3rd), 34 doubles 
(4th), .959 OPS (4th), 67 extra base hits (6th), .323 batting average (7th), 
109 RBIs (9th), 259 total bases (9th), and .408 on-base percentage (10th). 
Evers also led AL outfielders in fielding percentage (.997) with one error 
in over 325 chances. When Evers came to the plate in Detroit, Tigers fans 
would rise to their feet and yell "Ho-o-o-o-t", "Ho-o-o-o-t." Left fielder 
Johnny Groth played for the Tigers from 1946 to 1952. Tabbed for superstardom 
in 1949 by Time, Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post, and Life after he 
hit .340 for the Buffalo Bisons,[citation needed] Groth hit .306 in 1959 
with career-highs in home runs (12), RBIs (85), hits (173), runs scored 
(95), on-base percentage (.407), doubles (30), walks (95), plate appearances 
(670), and games played (157). At one point during the 1950 season, he 
had eight consecutive hits. Pat Mullin was a backup outfielder for the 
1950 Tigers. He hit .251 in 97 games. The Tigers' 1950 pitching staff had 
a team ERA of 4.12, second best in the American League behind the Cleveland 
Indians. The ace of the staff was Art Houtteman. In 1950, Houtteman was 
chosen for the All Star team for the only time in his career. He had a 
record of 19–12 with a 3.54 ERA (Adjusted ERA+ of 132), 21 complete games 
and four shutouts in 274⅔ innings pitched. Fred Hutchinson had the second 
most wins on the 1950 staff. He finished the year with a 17–8 record, a 
.680 winning percentage, and a 3.96 ERA in 231⅔ innings pitched. Hall of 
Famer Hal Newhouser had his poorest season since 1943, finishing with a 
15–13 record and a 4.34 ERA in 213⅔ inning pitched. Dizzy Trout led the 
team with a .722 winning percentage (2nd best in the AL) with a 13–5 record 
and 3.75 ERA (Adjusted ERA+ of 124) in 184⅔ innings pitched. Ted Gray led 
the team with 102 strikeouts. Despite a 4.40 ERA, he finished the season 
with a 10–7 record in 149⅓ innings pitched. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
