Harold Douglas Harvey (born March 13, 1930) is a former umpire in Major 
League Baseball (MLB), who worked in the National League (NL) from 1962 
through 1992. Noted for his authoritative command of baseball rules, he 
earned the tongue-in-cheek nickname "God" from players, and was among the 
last major league umpires who never attended an umpiring school. Harvey 
umpired five World Series and six All-Star Games. His career total of 4,673 
games[1] ranked third in major league history at the time of his retirement. 
He was the ninth umpire to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[1] 
In 1999, the Society for American Baseball Research ranked Harvey as the 
second-greatest umpire in history, behind only Bill Klem.[2][3] In 2007, 
Referee magazine selected him as one of the 52 most influential figures 
in the history of sports officiating.[4] Harvey wore uniform number 8 for 
most of his career. Harvey began officiating local basketball games at 
the high school level at age 16, later umpiring softball and baseball. 
He attended San Diego State College in 1955-56, where he played baseball 
and football. He then returned to umpiring in the minor leagues while also 
officiating college basketball and football games. He remained a resident 
of San Diego throughout his umpiring career. He umpired in the California 
League from 1958 to 1960, and in the Pacific Coast League in 1961. He married 
Joy Ann Glascock on September 24, 1960, and the couple had two sons, Scott 
and Todd.[5] Upon reaching the majors on April 10, 1962, his greatest influences 
were umpires Al Barlick, Jocko Conlan and Shag Crawford, each of whom gave 
him invaluable advice in developing his skills – Barlick for his renowned 
mastery of the rules, Conlan for helping him appreciate the fun of umpiring, 
and Crawford for his tremendous work ethic.[6] Harvey worked second base 
in the final game of the 1972 season, in which Roberto Clemente collected 
his 3,000th (and last) base hit off the New York Mets' Jon Matlack then 
retrieved the ball for Clemente. He was the home plate umpire on September 
10, 1963, when brothers Jesus, Matty, and Felipe Alou batted consecutively 
for the San Francisco Giants,[7] and also on June 3, 1987, when the Houston 
Astros and Chicago Cubs hit a combined three grand slams at Wrigley Field.[8] 
He was also the home plate umpire for the Pirates inaugural game (against 
the Cincinnati Reds) at Three Rivers Stadium on July 16, 1970. Harvey umpired 
in five World Series (1968, 1974, 1981, 1984 and 1988), serving as crew 
chief in 1984 and 1988, and in seven All-Star Games (1963, 1964, 1971, 
1977, 1982, 1987, and 1992), calling balls and strikes for the 1982 and 
1992 games. He also set a record by officiating in the National League 
Championship Series nine times – 1970 (Games 2-3), 1972, 1976, 1980, 1983, 
1984 (Game 5), 1986, 1989 and 1991 – serving as crew chief for the last 
three; his record was later tied by Paul Runge, and broken by Bruce Froemming 
in 2000. Harvey was the home plate umpire for the single-game playoff to 
decide the NL's Western Division champion in 1980, between the Houston 
Astros and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Harvey was the home plate umpire for 
Game 1 of the 1988 World Series when Kirk Gibson hit a game-winning home 
run off Dennis Eckersley. The Los Angeles Dodgers would win the series 
in 5 games. The Players Association conducted polls of players in both 
leagues to identify and rank the best umpires in 1974; Harvey was named 
the top NL umpire, being the only official in the league rated as "excellent."[9] 
In 1987, a Sports Illustrated poll of NL catchers ranked him as the third 
best umpire in the league for calling balls and strikes, with one voter 
saying he "still cares about doing the best possible job."[10] In 1990, 
Sport magazine named him the best umpire in the game, citing his unbending 
application of the rules and noting his campaign to enforce the balk rule 
two seasons earlier, when he said, "Give me ten high school pitchers, let 
me spend a week with them, and I'll show you 10 pitchers who won't balk. 
It's not that difficult. So they better learn it."[11] Harvey's goal of 
umpiring until age 65 ended on October 4, 1992, at age 62, when knee problems 
necessitated his retirement. He nonetheless became the first NL umpire 
since Bill Klem to work for more than 30 years, finishing with 31 years 
in the major leagues; his 4,673 games then ranked third in major league 
history behind Klem (5,374) and Tommy Connolly (4,769).[12] Harvey felt 
that his introduction of a new sense of timing to umpiring was his greatest 
contribution to baseball. He noted that when he arrived in the major leagues, 
the emphasis was on making calls quickly and decisively, and said, "Everything 
was called too quickly. I've got a photograph of Jocko Conlan working first 
base. Jocko's arm was extended in the out call. But the runner was still 
short of the bag, and the ball was still in flight. In those days it was 
common to anticipate the call." Harvey, however, changed attitudes by insisting 
that it was better to delay the call and make sure it was correct.[13] 
Harvey was easily recognizable due to his thick white hair, which had already 
gone completely gray when he was in his 30s, leading to the early nickname 
of "Silver,"[14] and in late 1971, he grew a handlebar mustache,[15] at 
a time when no major league field personnel had worn facial hair since 
the 1940s; he kept it trimmed to the edges of his mouth, and he wore it 
during the 1972 season (Oakland A's players began to grow mustaches that 
season in order to earn bonuses from owner Charlie O. Finley). In the latter 
part of his career, Harvey was the voice of MLB's "You Make the Call" segments.[16] 
In August 1997, Harvey was diagnosed with esophageal Cancer, which was 
attributed to his longtime use of chewing tobacco.[17] In both 2003 and 
2007, Harvey was the leading candidate for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 
voting by Hall members on the Veterans Committee composite ballot for managers, 
umpires and executives; however, his totals of 48 and 52 votes in the two 
elections fell short of the 60 and 62 necessary for election. Under new 
rules established by the Hall in 2007, he was again eligible for election 
in 2008, but fell one vote short of the required 12 votes. On December 
7, 2009, Harvey was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the
