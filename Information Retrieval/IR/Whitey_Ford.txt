Edward Charles "Whitey" Ford (born October 21, 1928),[1] nicknamed "The 
Chairman of the Board" is an American former professional baseball pitcher 
who spent his entire 16-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the 
New York Yankees. He was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974. 
Ford is a ten-time MLB All-Star and six-time World Series champion. Ford 
won both the Cy Young Award and World Series Most Valuable Player Award 
in 1961. He led the American League in wins three times and in earned run 
average twice. The Yankees retired Ford's uniform number in his honor. 
In the wake of Yogi Berra's 2015 death, George Vecsey writing in the New 
York Times, suggested that Ford is now "The Greatest Living Yankee."[2] 
Ford was a native of the Astoria neighborhood of Queens in New York City, 
a few miles by the Triborough Bridge from Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.[3] 
He graduated from the Manhattan High School of Aviation Trades. Ford was 
signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1947, and played 
his entire career with them. He was nicknamed "Whitey" while in the minor 
leagues for his light blond hair.[4] He began his Major League Baseball 
career on July 1, 1950 with the Yankees and made a spectacular debut, winning 
his first nine decisions before losing a game in relief. Ford received 
a handful of lower-ballot Most Valuable Player votes despite throwing just 
112 innings, and was voted the AL Rookie of the Year by the Sporting News. 
(Walt Dropo was the Rookie of Year choice of the BBWAA.) During the Korean 
War, in 1951 and 1952 Ford served in the Army. He rejoined the Yankees 
for the 1953 season, and the Yankee "Big Three" pitching staff became a 
"Big Four", as Ford joined Allie Reynolds, Vic Raschi and Eddie Lopat. 
Eventually Ford went from the No. 4 pitcher on a great staff to the universally 
acclaimed No. 1 pitcher of the Yankees. He became known as the "Chairman 
of the Board" for his ability to remain calm and in command during high-pressure 
situations. He was also known as "Slick," a nickname given to him, Billy 
Martin and Mickey Mantle by manager Casey Stengel, who called them Whiskey 
Slicks. Ford's guile was necessary because he did not have an overwhelming 
fastball, but being able to throw several other pitches very well gave 
him pinpoint control. Ford was an effective strikeout pitcher for his time, 
tying the then-AL record for six consecutive strikeouts in 1956, and again 
in 1958. Ford pitched 2 consecutive one-hit games in 1955 to tie a record 
held by several pitchers. In 1955, Ford led the American League in complete 
games and games won; in 1956 in earned run average and winning percentage; 
in 1958, in earned run average; and in both 1961 and 1963, in games won 
and winning percentage. Ford won the Cy Young Award in 1961; he likely 
would have won the 1963 AL Cy Young, but this was before the institution 
of a separate award for each league, and Ford could not match Sandy Koufax's 
numbers for the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League. He would also 
have been a candidate in 1955, but this was before the award was created. 
Some of Ford's totals were depressed by Yankees manager Casey Stengel who 
viewed Ford as his top pitching asset, and often reserved his ace left-hander 
for more formidable opponents such as the Tigers, Indians, and White Sox. 
When he became manager in 1961, Ralph Houk promised Ford he would pitch 
every fourth day, regardless of opponent; after exceeding 30 starts only 
once in his nine seasons under Stengel, Ford had 39 in 1961. His first 
20-win season, a career-best 25-4 record, and the Cy Young Award ensued, 
but Ford's season was overshadowed by the home run battle between Roger 
Maris and Mickey Mantle. As a left-hander, Ford was also deft at keeping 
runners at their base: He set a record in 1961 by pitching 243 consecutive 
innings without allowing a stolen base. In May 1963, after pitching a shutout, 
Ford announced he had given up smoking. He said, "My doctor told me that 
whenever I think of smoking, I should think of a bus starting up and blowing 
the exhaust in my face."[5] Ford won 236 games for New York (career 236-106), 
still a franchise record. Red Ruffing, the previous Yankee record-holder, 
still leads all Yankee right-handed pitchers, with 231 of his 273 career 
wins coming with the Yankees. Other Yankee pitchers have had more career 
wins (for example, Roger Clemens notched his 300th career victory as a 
Yankee), but amassed them for multiple franchises. David Wells tied Whitey 
Ford for 13th place in victories by a left-hander on August 26, 2007. Among 
pitchers with at least 300 career decisions, Ford ranks first with a winning 
percentage of .690, the all-time highest percentage in modern baseball 
history. Ford's career winning percentage cannot be attributed just to 
being on a good team: The Yankees were 1,486-1,027 during his 16 years; 
without his 236-106, they had 1,250 wins and 921 losses, for a won-loss 
percentage of .576. Ford was thus 11.4 percentage points higher than his 
team's record, independent of his record. Ford's 2.75 earned run average 
is the second-lowest among starting pitchers whose careers began after 
the advent of the live-ball era in 1920. (Only Clayton Kershaw's current 
2.51 ERA is lower.) Ford's worst-ever ERA was 3.24. Ford had 45 shutout 
victories in his career, including eight 1-0 wins. Ford's status on the 
Yankees was underscored by the World Series. Ford was New York's Game One 
pitcher in 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1961, 1962, 1963, and 1964. He is the 
only pitcher to start four consecutive Game Ones, a streak he reached twice. 
In the 1960 World Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Stengel altered 
this strategy by holding Ford back until game three, a decision that angered 
Ford. The Yankees' ace won both his starts in Games Three and Six with 
complete-game shutouts, but was then unavailable to relieve in the last 
game of a Yankees loss, the Pirates winning the game—and the Series with 
it—on Bill Mazeroski's walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth. Ford 
always felt that had he been able to appear in three of the games instead 
of just two, the Yankees would have won. For his career, Ford had 10 World 
Series victories, more than any other pitcher. Ford also leads all starters 
in World Series losses (8) and starts (22), as well as innings, hits, walks, 
and strikeouts. In 1961 he broke Babe Ruth's World Series record of 29⅔ 
consecutive scoreless innings. (The record would eventually reach 33⅔. 
It is still a World Series record, although Mariano Rivera broke it as 
a postseason record in 2000.) Ford won the 1961 World Series MVP. In addition 
to Yankee Stadium, Ford also pitched World Series games in seven other 
stadiums: Ford appeared on eight AL All-Star teams between 1954 and 1964. 
Ford ended his career in declining health. In August 1966, he underwent 
surgery to correct a circulatory problem in his throwing shoulder. In May 
1967, Ford lasted just one inning in what would be his final start, and 
he announced his retirement at the end of the month at age 38. Ford wore 
number 19 in his rookie season. Following his return from the army in 1953, 
he wore number 16 for the remainder of his career. After retiring, Ford 
admitted in interviews to having occasionally doctored baseballs. Examples 
were the "mudball", used at home in Yankee Stadium. Yankee groundskeepers 
would wet down an area near the catcher's box where the Yankee catcher 
Elston Howard was positioned; pretending to lose balance, Howard would 
put down his hand with the ball and coat one side of the ball with mud 
and throw it to Ford. Ford sometimes used the diamond in his wedding ring 
to gouge the ball, but he was eventually caught by an umpire and warned 
to stop. Howard sharpened a buckle on his shinguard and used it to scuff 
the ball. Ford described his illicit behavior as concession to age: "I 
didn't begin cheating until late in my career, when I needed something 
to help me survive. I didn't cheat when I won the twenty-five games in 
1961. I don't want anybody to get any ideas and take my Cy Young Award 
away. And I didn't cheat in 1963 when I won twenty-four games. Well, maybe 
a little."[6] Ford admitted to doctoring the ball in the 1961 All Star 
Game at Candlestick Park to strike out Willie Mays. Ford and Mantle had 
accumulated $1200 ($9,403 today) in golf pro shop purchases as guests of 
Horace Stoneham at the Giants owner's country club. Stoneham promised to 
pay their tab if Ford could strike out Mays. In 1977, Ford was part of 
the broadcast team for the first game in Toronto Blue Jays history.[7] 
In 2008, Ford threw the first pitch at the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game. On September 21, 2008 Ford and Yogi Berra were guests of the broadcast 
team for the final game played at Yankee Stadium. In 2002, Ford opened 
up "Whitey Ford's Cafe", a sports-themed restaurant and bar next to Roosevelt 
Field Mall in Garden City, New York.[8] A replica of the Yankee Stadium 
facade trimmed both the exterior and the bar, whose stools displayed uniform 
numbers of Yankee luminaries; widescreen TVs were installed throughout. 
The main dining area housed a panoramic display of Yankee Stadium from 
the 1950s, specifically a Chicago White Sox–Yankee game with Ford pitching 
and Mickey Mantle in center field; the Yanks are up 2-0. Waiters and waitresses 
dressed in Yankees road uniforms, with Ford's retired No. 16 on the back.[9] 
It lasted less than a year before it closed down.[10] As of 2015, the 86-year-old 
Ford was splitting his time between his homes in Long Island and Florida.[2]
