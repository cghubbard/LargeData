Baseball PEI is the provincial governing body for baseball in Prince Edward 
Island.[1] Baseball PEI is a member of Baseball Canada[2] and Baseball 
Atlantic.[3] Baseball was introduced to Prince Edward Island during the 
late 19th century and early 20th century, often by natives of Prince Edward 
Island, who went to the United States to work, returning to or visiting 
Prince Edward Island.[4] The first provincial championship was in 1896, 
when Charlottetown defeated the Pisquid club.[5] After this point, the 
Maritime Amateur Athletic Association loosely organized provincial play-downs 
and championships to determine those teams representing Prince Edward Island 
at Maritime championships.[6][6] On Prince Edward Island, organized and 
semi-organized leagues formed by the 1920s in various pockets of Prince 
Edward Island, especially in Kings County, Charlottetown, Summerside and 
western Prince County, and the health and popularity of these leagues ebbed-and-flowed 
through the pre- and post-war decades.[7] In 1964-65, the Prince Edward 
Island Amateur Baseball Association (PEIABA) was formed to take over the 
organizing of provincial play-downs and championships in order to determine 
the Prince Edward Island representatives at Maritime and National championships.[6] 
Shortly after this time, the PEIABA began organizing county leagues. In 
1969, the PEIABA took the responsibility of organizing and fielding a provincial 
representative for the quadrennial Canada Summer Games; and in 1989, also 
took on the responsibility of fielding the PEI Youth Selects, the Prince 
Edward Island representative at the Baseball Canada Cup. After this point, 
all teams that represented Prince Edward Island in a Maritime, Atlantic 
and National championship were determined by the PEIABA.[8] By the mid-1990s, 
the provincial government and other sectors required more organization 
from the PEIABA. On 12 September 1997, the PEIABA became a not-for-profit 
organization within the province of Prince Edward Island and changed its 
name to "Baseball PEI." Since that time, Baseball PEI has grown significantly.[9] 
On top of running Elimination tournaments, provincial jamborees and championships, 
and fielding and organizing provincial teams, Baseball PEI now offers province-wide 
leagues from Junior Mosquito/9U to Junior/21U (with the Intermediate Kings 
County Baseball League also a member). Baseball PEI also is heavily involved 
with grassroots baseball; it assists associations with the set-up of Rally 
Cap/8U and runs Rally Cap Jamborees. As well, Baseball PEI has the Summer 
Clinic Program, where teams and members of Baseball PEI can have two clinicians 
come out and run a clinic on a baseball skill (in 2015, there were 60 clinics 
run across Prince Edward Island).[9] Due to Baseball PEI's efforts at the 
grassroots level, and its dedication to improving the skills and enjoyment 
of its members, it has been named Baseball Canada's "Province of the Year" 
in 2013 (in which it shared with Baseball Ontario) and in 2015.[10] Baseball 
PEI is a non-profit organization that continuously enables the development 
of baseball skills and knowledge among youth across Prince Edward Island.[9] 
Baseball PEI has a Board of Directors that makes rules, policies and procedures 
concerning the managing of affairs, discipline, and operation of Baseball 
PEI teams, associations and competitions.[11] The Board of Directors of 
Baseball PEI is as follows: President: Don LeClair Director of Administration/High 
Performance: Walter MacEwen Director of Provincial Teams: Allan Kelly Director 
of Mosquito Competitions: Darrel Kirev Director of Peewee Competitions: 
Ken Gaudet Director of Bantam and Midget Competitions: Allison Macdonald 
Executive Director: Randy Byrne There are eleven minor baseball associations 
across Prince Edward Island that make up Baseball PEI: - Souris Minor Baseball 
Association - Northside Minor Baseball Association - Cardigan and Area 
Minor Ball Association - Stratford Minor Baseball Association - Sherwood/Parkdale 
Minor Baseball Association - Charlottetown Area Baseball Association - 
Cornwall and Area Minor Baseball Association - Kensington Minor Baseball 
Association - Bedeque and Area Minor Baseball Association - Summerside 
and Area Minor Baseball Association - Western Minor Baseball Association[12] 
Each association is a member of one of four "AAA" zones across Prince Edward 
Island (each zone must have at least one "AAA" team in each age division 
each season).[11] - Eastern (Souris, Northside, Cardigan, Stratford) - 
Capital District (Sherwood/Parkdale, Charlottetown) - Mid-Isle (Cornwall, 
Kensington, Bedeque) - Egmont (Summerside, Western) Baseball PEI organizes 
and runs the following leagues:[9] - Junior Mosquito (9U) - Mosquito "A," 
"AA," and "AAA" (11U) - Peewee "A," "AA," and "AAA" (13U) - Bantam "A," 
"AA" and "AAA" (15U) - Midget (18U) - Junior (21U) Baseball PEI organizes 
and runs the following provincial jamboree/championship (please note that 
the provincial champion represents Prince Edward Island at the corresponding 
Baseball Atlantic competition, unless it's in Newfoundland and Labrador, 
in which there is a provincial elimination tournament held to determine 
the Prince Edward Island representative).[9] - Rally Cap (Jamboree) - Junior 
Mosquito (Jamboree) - Mosquito "A" (Jamboree) - Mosquito "AA" (Provincial 
Championship) - Mosquito "AAA" (Provincial Championship) - Peewee "A" (Provincial

Bantam "AAA" (Provincial Championship; winner is awarded The Tanner Craswell 
Memorial Trophy) - Midget (Provincial Championship; winner is awarded The 
J. Vernon Handrahan Trophy) - Junior (Provincial Play-Offs) Baseball PEI 
is heavily invested with promoting grassroots development of players and 
coaches across Prince Edward Island. In the summer, their Summer Clinics 
Program runs clinics on hitting, throwing/pitching, fielding and other 
baseball fundamentals (as well as Rally Cap testing and the "My First Pitch" 
program) for teams and associations across Prince Edward Island. In 2016, 
there were over 60 clinics ran across the province, mostly for players 
11 and under, and in 2016, Baseball PEI hired two player clinicians and 
one coach clinician (who worked with grassroots coaches). As well, Baseball 
PEI works very closely with its associations to offer the Rally Cap (8U) 
program, and runs Rally Cap jamborees in the latter part of August each 
year.[13] Other grassroots programs offered by Baseball PEI are the Winterball 
program (in partnership with schools across Prince Edward Island to distribute 
and implement over the past 10 years) and the Challenger program (in partnership 
with the Stratford Minor Baseball Association; this program is designed 
for players with a physical and/or mental disability).[13] Baseball PEI 
organizes and fields the following provincial teams each year: - The PEI 
Youth Selects (representing Prince Edward Island at the 17U Baseball Canada 
Cup each year [except Canada Games' years]) - The Midget All-Stars (representing 
Prince Edward Island at the Baseball Canada National 18U Championships) 
Also, Baseball PEI sends a team to the Baseball PEI National 15U Championships 
each year; that team is usually the club team (plus pick-ups) that wins 
the annual Elimination tournament in July. In years where the National 
Championship is relatively close, Baseball PEI sends a provincial team 
to the Baseball Canada National 21U Championships. All umpires used for 
Baseball PEI sanctioned-games are supplied by the Prince Edward Island 
Baseball Umpires' Association (the PEIBUA). The current Supervisor of Officials 
is Kent Walker. It is the PEIBUA's mandate to carry out all umpires' certification 
and recertification at the start of each season - usually in May - and 
to supply umpires for all Baseball PEI exhibition, tournament, regular 
season, Elimination and provincial championship games (as well as any Baseball 
Atlantic Championship games being held on Prince Edward Island).[14] Charlottetown
