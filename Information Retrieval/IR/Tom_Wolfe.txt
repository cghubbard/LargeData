Thomas Kennerly "Tom" Wolfe, Jr. (born March 2, 1931)[1] is an American 
author and journalist, best known for his association with and influence 
over the New Journalism literary movement, in which literary techniques 
are used extensively and traditional values of journalistic objectivity 
and evenhandedness are rejected. He began his career as a regional newspaper 
reporter in the 1950s, but achieved national prominence in the 1960s following 
the publication of such best-selling books as The Electric Kool-Aid Acid 
Test (a highly experimental account of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters), 
and two collections of articles and essays, Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing the 
Flak Catchers and The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby. His 
first novel, The Bonfire of the Vanities, published in 1987, was met with 
critical acclaim, became a commercial success, and was adapted as a major 
motion picture (directed by Brian De Palma). Wolfe was born in Richmond, 
Virginia, the son of Louise (née Agnew), a landscape designer, and Thomas 
Kennerly Wolfe, Sr., an agronomist.[2][3] Wolfe grew up on Gloucester Road 
in the historic Richmond North Side neighborhood of Sherwood Park. He recounts 
some of his childhood memories of growing up there in a foreword to a book 
about the nearby historic Ginter Park neighborhood. Wolfe was student council 
president, editor of the school newspaper and a star baseball player at 
St. Christopher's School, an Episcopalian all-boys school in Richmond, 
Virginia. Upon graduation in 1947, he turned down admission to Princeton 
University to attend Washington and Lee University, both all-male schools 
at the time; at Washington and Lee, Wolfe was a member of the Phi Kappa 
Sigma fraternity. Wolfe majored in English and practiced his writing outside 
the classroom as well. He was the sports editor of the college newspaper 
and helped found a literary magazine, Shenandoah. Of particular influence 
was his professor Marshall Fishwick, a teacher of American studies educated 
at Yale. More in the tradition of anthropology than literary scholarship, 
Fishwick taught his classes to look at the whole of a culture, including 
those elements considered profane. The very title of Wolfe's undergraduate 
thesis, "A Zoo Full of Zebras: Anti-Intellectualism in America," evinced 
his fondness for words and aspirations toward cultural criticism. Wolfe 
graduated cum laude in 1951. Wolfe had continued playing baseball as a 
pitcher and had begun to play semi-professionally while still in college. 
In 1952 he earned a tryout with the New York Giants but was cut after three 
days, which Wolfe blamed on his inability to throw good fastballs. Wolfe 
abandoned baseball and instead followed his professor Fishwick's example, 
enrolling in Yale University's American studies doctoral program. His PhD 
thesis was titled The League of American Writers: Communist Organizational 
Activity Among American Writers, 1929–1942.[4] In the course of his research, 
Wolfe interviewed many writers, including Malcolm Cowley, Archibald MacLeish, 
and James T. Farrell.[5] A biographer remarked on the thesis: "Reading 
it, one sees what has been the most baleful influence of graduate education 
on many who have suffered through it: it deadens all sense of style."[6] 
His thesis was originally rejected but he finally passed by rewriting it 
being objective instead of subjective. Upon leaving Yale he wrote a friend 
explaining through expletives his personal opinions about his thesis. Though 
Wolfe was offered teaching jobs in academia, he opted to work as a reporter. 
In 1956, while still preparing his thesis, Wolfe became a reporter for 
the Springfield Union in Springfield, Massachusetts. Wolfe finished his 
thesis in 1957 and in 1959 was hired by The Washington Post. Wolfe has 
said that part of the reason he was hired by the Post was his lack of interest 
in politics. The Post's city editor was "amazed that Wolfe preferred cityside 
to Capitol Hill, the beat every reporter wanted." He won an award from 
The Newspaper Guild for foreign reporting in Cuba in 1961 and also won 
the Guild's award for humor. While there, he experimented with fiction-writing 
techniques in feature stories.[7] In 1962, Wolfe left Washington for New 
York City, taking a position with the New York Herald Tribune as a general 
assignment reporter and feature writer. The editors of the Herald Tribune, 
including Clay Felker of the Sunday section supplement New York magazine, 
encouraged their writers to break the conventions of newspaper writing.[8] 
During the 1962 New York City newspaper strike, Wolfe approached Esquire 
magazine about an article on the hot rod and custom car culture of Southern 
California. He struggled with the article until finally a desperate editor, 
Byron Dobell, suggested that Wolfe send him his notes so they could piece 
the story together. Wolfe procrastinated until, on the evening before the 
article was due, he typed a letter to Dobell explaining what he wanted 
to say on the subject, ignoring all journalistic conventions. Dobell's 
response was to remove the salutation "Dear Byron" from the top of the 
letter and publish it intact as reportage. The result, published in 1963, 
was "There Goes (Varoom! Varoom!) That Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline 
Baby." The article was widely discussed—loved by some, hated by others—and 
helped Wolfe publish his first book, The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake 
Streamline Baby, a collection of his writings in the Herald-Tribune, Esquire, 
and other publications.[9] This was what Wolfe called New Journalism, in 
which some journalists and essayists experimented with a variety of literary 
techniques, mixing them with the traditional ideal of dispassionate, even-handed 
reporting. More specifically, Wolfe experimented with four literary devices 
not normally associated with feature writing—scene-by-scene construction, 
extensive dialogue, multiple points of view, and detailed description of 
one's status-life symbols (the materialistic choices one makes)—to produce 
this stylized form of journalism, which would later be commonly referred 
to as literary journalism.[10] Of status symbols, Wolfe has said, "I think 
every living moment of a human being’s life, unless the person is starving 
or in immediate danger of death in some other way, is controlled by a concern 
for status."[11] Wolfe also championed what he called “saturation reporting,” 
a reportorial approach where the journalist “shadows” and observes the 
subject over an extended period of time. “To pull it off,” says Wolfe, 
“you casually have to stay with the people you are writing about for long 
stretches . . . long enough so that you are actually there when revealing 
scenes take place in their lives.”[12] Saturation reporting differs from 
“in-depth” and “investigative” reporting, which involve the direct interviewing 
of numerous sources and/or the extensive analyzing of external documents 
relating to the story. Saturation reporting, according to communication 
professor Richard Kallan, “entails a more complex set of relationships 
wherein the journalist becomes an involved, more fully reactive witness, 
no longer distanced and detached from the people and events reported.”[13] 
One of the most striking examples of New Journalism is Wolfe's The Electric 
Kool-Aid Acid Test. The book, an account of the adventures of the Merry 
Pranksters, a famous sixties counter-culture group, was highly experimental 
in its use of onomatopoeia, free association, and eccentric punctuation—such 
as multiple exclamation marks and italics—to convey the manic ideas and 
personalities of Ken Kesey and his followers. In addition to his own forays 
into this new style of journalism, Wolfe edited a collection of New Journalism 
with E.W. Johnson, published in 1973 and titled The New Journalism. This 
book brought together pieces from Truman Capote, Hunter S. Thompson, Norman 
Mailer, Gay Talese, Joan Didion, and several other well-known writers with 
the common theme of journalism that incorporated literary techniques and 
that could be considered literature.[14] In 1965, a collection of his articles 
in this style was published under the title The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake 
Streamline Baby, and Wolfe's fame grew. A second volume of articles, The 
Pump House Gang, followed in 1968. Wolfe wrote on popular culture, architecture, 
politics, and other topics that underscored, among other things, how American 
life in the 1960s had been transformed by post-WWII economic prosperity. 
His defining work from this era is The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (published 
the same day as The Pump House Gang in 1968), which for many epitomized 
the 1960s. Although a conservative in many ways and certainly not a hippie 
(in 2008, he claimed never to have used LSD and to have tried marijuana 
only once[15]) Wolfe became one of the notable figures of the decade. In 
1970, he published two essays in book form as Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing 
the Flak Catchers: "Radical Chic," a biting account of a party given by 
Leonard Bernstein to raise money for the Black Panther Party, and "Mau-Mauing 
The Flak Catchers," about the practice of using racial intimidation ("mau-mauing") 
to extract funds from government welfare bureaucrats ("flak catchers"). 
The phrase "radical chic" soon became a popular derogatory term for upper-class 
leftism. Published in 1977, Mauve Gloves & Madmen, Clutter & Vine included 
one of Wolfe's more famous essays, "The Me Decade and the Third Great Awakening." 
In 1979, Wolfe published The Right Stuff, an account of the pilots who 
became America's first astronauts. Famously following their training and 
unofficial, even foolhardy, exploits, he likened these heroes to "single 
combat champions" of a bygone era, going forth to battle in the space race 
on behalf of their country. In 1983, the book was adapted as a successful 
feature film. In 2016 Wolfe published The Kingdom of Speech, which is a 
controversial[16] critique of Charles Darwin and Noam Chomsky.[17] Wolfe 
also wrote two highly skeptical social histories of modern art and modern 
architecture, The Painted Word and From Bauhaus to Our House, in 1975 and 
1981, respectively. The Painted Word mocked the excessive insularity of 
the art world and its dependence on what he saw as faddish critical theory, 
while From Bauhaus to Our House explored the negative effects of the Bauhaus 
style on the evolution of modern architecture.[18] A fictional television 
movie appeared on PBS in 1977, "Tom Wolfe's Los Angeles", a suitably satirical 
story set in Los Angeles. Wolfe appears in the movie himself.[19][20] Throughout 
his early career, Wolfe had planned to write a novel that would capture 
the wide spectrum of American society. Among his models was William Makepeace 
Thackeray's Vanity Fair, which described the society of 19th century England. 
Wolfe remained occupied writing nonfiction books and contributing to Harper's 
until 1981, when he ceased his other work to concentrate on the novel. 
Wolfe began researching the novel by observing cases at the Manhattan Criminal 
Court and shadowing members of the Bronx homicide squad. While the research 
came easily, the writing did not immediately follow. To overcome his writer's 
block, Wolfe wrote to Jann Wenner, editor of Rolling Stone, to propose 
an idea drawn from Charles Dickens and Thackeray. The Victorian novelists 
that Wolfe viewed as his models had often written their novels in serial 
installments. Wenner offered Wolfe around $200,000 to serialize his work.[21] 
The deadline pressure gave him the motivation he had hoped for, and from 
July 1984 to August 1985 each biweekly issue of Rolling Stone contained 
a new installment. Wolfe was later not happy with his "very public first 
draft"[22] and thoroughly revised his work. Even Sherman McCoy, the novel's 
central character, changed: originally a writer, the book version cast 
McCoy as a bond salesman. Wolfe researched and revised for two years, and 
his The Bonfire of the Vanities was published in 1987. The book was a commercial 
and critical success, spending weeks on bestseller lists and earning praise 
from much of the literary establishment on which Wolfe had long heaped 
scorn.[23] Because of the success of Wolfe's first novel, there was widespread 
interest in his second. This novel took him more than 11 years to complete; 
A Man in Full was published in 1998. The book's reception was not universally 
favorable, though it received glowing reviews in Time, Newsweek, The Wall 
Street Journal and elsewhere. An enormous initial printing of 1.2 million 
copies was announced and the book stayed at number one on the New York 
Times bestseller list for ten weeks. John Updike wrote a critical review 
for The New Yorker complaining that the novel "amounts to entertainment, 
not literature, even literature in a modest aspirant form." This touched 
off an intense war of words in the print and broadcast media between Wolfe 
and Updike, John Irving, and Norman Mailer. In 2001, Wolfe published an 
essay referring to these three authors as "My Three Stooges." After publishing 
Hooking Up (a collection of short pieces, including the 1997 novella Ambush 
at Fort Bragg) in 2001, he followed up with his third novel, I Am Charlotte 
Simmons (2004), which chronicles the decline of a poor, bright scholarship 
student from Alleghany County, North Carolina, in the context of snobbery, 
materialism, institutionalised anti-intellectualism and sexual promiscuity 
she finds at a prestigious contemporary American university. The novel 
met with a mostly tepid response by critics but won praise from many social 
conservatives, who saw the book's account of college sexuality as revealing 
of a disturbing moral decline. The novel won a Bad Sex in Fiction Award 
from the London-based Literary Review, a prize established "to draw attention 
to the crude, tasteless, often perfunctory use of redundant passages of 
sexual description in the modern novel". Wolfe later explained that such 
sexual references were deliberately clinical. Wolfe has written that his 
goal in writing fiction is to document contemporary society in the tradition 
of John Steinbeck, Charles Dickens, and Émile Zola. In early 2008, it was 
announced that Wolfe was leaving his longtime publisher, Farrar, Straus 
and Giroux. His fourth novel, Back to Blood, was published in October 2012 
by Little, Brown. According to The New York Times, Wolfe was paid close 
to US$7 million for the book.[24] According to the publisher, Back to Blood 
is about "class, family, wealth, race, crime, sex, corruption and ambition 
in Miami, the city where America's future has arrived first."[25] Several 
themes are present in much of Wolfe's writing, including his novels. One 
such theme is male power-jockeying, which is a major part of The Bonfire 
of the Vanities, A Man in Full, and I Am Charlotte Simmons as well as several 
of his journalistic pieces. Male characters in his fiction often suffer 
from feelings of extreme inadequacy or hugely inflated egos, sometimes 
alternating between both. He satirizes racial politics, most commonly between 
whites and blacks; he also highlights class divisions between characters. 
Men's fashions often play a large part in his stories, being used to indicate 
economic status. Much of his recent work also addresses neuroscience, a 
subject which he admitted a fascination with in "Sorry, Your Soul Just 
Died," one of the essays in Hooking Up, and which played a large role in 
I Am Charlotte Simmons—the title character being a student of neuroscience, 
and characters' thought processes, such as fear, humiliation and lust, 
frequently being described in the terminology of brain chemistry. Wolfe 
also frequently gives detailed descriptions of various aspects of his characters' 
anatomies.[26] Two of his novels (A Man in Full and I Am Charlotte Simmons) 
feature major characters (Conrad Hensley and Jojo Johanssen, respectively) 
who are set on paths to self-discovery by reading classical Roman and Greek 
philosophy. Law and banking firms in Wolfe's writing often have satirical 
names formed by the surnames of the partners. "Dunning, Sponget and Leach" 
and "Curry, Goad and Pesterall" appear in The Bonfire of the Vanities, 
and "Wringer, Fleasom and Tick" in A Man in Full. Ambush at Fort Bragg 
contains a law firm called "Crotalus, Adder, Cobran and Krate" (all names 
or homophones of venomous snakes). Some characters appear in multiple novels, 
creating a sense of a "universe" that is continuous throughout Wolfe's 
fiction. The character of Freddy Button, a lawyer from Bonfire of the Vanities, 
is mentioned briefly in I Am Charlotte Simmons. A character named Ronald 
Vine, an interior decorator who is mentioned in The Bonfire of the Vanities, 
reappears in A Man in Full as the designer of Charlie Croker's home. A 
fictional sexual practice called "that thing with the cup" appears in several 
of his writings, including The Bonfire of the Vanities, A Man in Full and 
a (non-fiction) essay in Hooking Up. The surname "Bolka" appears in three 
Wolfe novels—as the name of a rendering plant in A Man in Full, as a partner 
in an accounting firm in Bonfire of the Vanities, and as a college lacrosse 
player from the Balkans in I Am Charlotte Simmons. Wolfe adopted the white 
suit as a trademark in 1962. He bought his first white suit planning to 
wear it in the summer in the style of Southern gentlemen. However, he found 
that the suit he purchased was too heavy for summer use, so he wore it 
in winter, which created a sensation.[27] Wolfe has maintained this uniform 
ever since, sometimes worn with a matching white tie, white homburg hat, 
and two-tone shoes. Wolfe has said that the outfit disarms the people he 
observes, making him, in their eyes, "a man from Mars, the man who didn't 
know anything and was eager to know."[28] In 1989, Wolfe wrote an essay 
for Harper's Magazine titled "Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast", which 
criticized modern American novelists for failing to engage fully with their 
subjects, and suggested that modern literature could be saved by a greater 
reliance on journalistic technique. This attack on the mainstream literary 
establishment was interpreted as a boast that Wolfe's work was superior 
to more highly regarded authors.[29] Wolfe was a supporter of George W. 
Bush and said he voted for him for president in 2004 because of what he 
called Bush's "great decisiveness and willingness to fight." (Bush apparently 
reciprocates the admiration, having read all of Wolfe's books, according 
to friends in 2005.[30]) After this fact emerged in a New York Times interview, 
Wolfe said that the reaction in the literary world was as if he had said, 
"I forgot to tell you—I'm a child molester." Because of this incident, 
he sometimes wears an American flag pin on his suit, which he compared 
to "holding up a cross to werewolves."[31] Wolfe's views and choice of 
subject material, such as mocking left-wing intellectuals in Radical Chic 
and glorifying astronauts in The Right Stuff, have sometimes led to his 
being labeled conservative,[32] and his depiction of the Black Panther 
Party in Radical Chic led to a member of the party calling him a racist.[33] 
Wolfe rejects such labels; in a 2004 interview, he said that his "idol" 
in writing about society and culture is Émile Zola, who, in Wolfe's words, 
was "a man of the left" but "went out, and found a lot of ambitious, drunk, 
slothful and mean people out there. Zola simply could not—and was not interested 
in—telling a lie."[32] Asked to comment by the Wall Street Journal on blogs 
in 2007 to mark the tenth anniversary of their advent, Wolfe wrote that 
"the universe of blogs is a universe of rumors" and that "blogs are an 
advance guard to the rear." He also took the opportunity to criticize Wikipedia, 
saying that "only a primitive would believe a word of" it. He noted a story 
about him in his Wikipedia entry at the time, which he said had never happened.[34] 
Wolfe lives in New York City with his wife Sheila, who designs covers for 
Harper's magazine. They have two children, a daughter, Alexandra, and a 
son, Tommy.[35] A writer for Examiner Magazine who interviewed Wolfe in 
1998 said, "He has no computer and does not surf, or even know how to use, 
the Internet", adding, however, that Wolfe's novel A Man in Full does have 
a subplot involving "a muckraking cyber-gossip site, à la the Drudge Report 
or Salon."[35] Wolfe is credited with introducing the terms "statusphere," 
"the right stuff," "radical chic," "the Me Decade," "social x-ray," and 
"pushing the envelope" into the English lexicon.[36][dubious – discuss] 
He is sometimes credited with inventing the term "trophy wife" as well, 
but this is incorrect: he described emaciated wives as "X-rays" in his 
novel The Bonfire of the Vanities but did not use the term "trophy wife".[37] 
According to journalism professor Ben Yagoda, Wolfe is also responsible 
for the use of the present tense in magazine profile pieces; before he 
began doing so in the early 1960s, profile articles had always been written
