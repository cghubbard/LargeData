The UCLA Bruins are the athletic teams that represent the University of 
California, Los Angeles. The Bruin men's and women's teams participate 
in NCAA Division I as part of the Pac-12 Conference and the Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation (MPSF). For football, they are in the Football Bowl Subdivision 
of Division I (formerly Division I-A). UCLA has the most decorated athletic 
program in NCAA history, with 113 NCAA team championships.[2][3] UCLA offers 
10 varsity sports programs for men and 13 for women.[4] UCLA sponsors teams 
in eleven men's and fourteen women's NCAA sanctioned sports:[5] Men's Intercollegiate 
Sports Women's Intercollegiate Sports The UCLA athletic teams' colors are 
True Blue[7][8][9] and Gold. In the early days of the school, UCLA had 
the same colors as the University of California, Berkeley; Yale blue and 
gold. When football coach Red Sanders came to UCLA for the 1949 season 
he redesigned the football uniforms. The Yale blue was changed to a lighter 
shade of blue. Sanders figured that the baby blue would look better on 
the field and in film. He would dub the baby blue uniform "Powderkeg blue", 
powder blue with an explosive kick.[10] For the 1954 football season, Sanders 
added a gold loop on the shoulders, the UCLA Stripe.[11] UCLA still uses 
different color blues. They have an alternate uniform that is predominately 
Navy. Their helmet has the UCLA script in Royal. In 2014, UCLA named all 
of its recreation and athletics facilities in honor of Jackie Robinson, 
who was a four-sport student-athlete at the school and went on to play 
Major League baseball as the first African American to do so in the league.[12] 
The Jackie Robinson "42" Athletics and Recreation Complex monument was 
installed in front of the John Wooden Recreation Center and was unveiled 
on March 5, 2016. The school also retired number 42 which was the number 
Robinson worn as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers.[13] Two notable sports 
facilities serve as home venues for UCLA sports. Since 1982, the Bruin 
football team has played home games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. 
From 1923–81, including the Bruins' 1954 National Championship year, the 
team played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. 
The women’s gymnastics, men's and women's basketball, and volleyball teams 
play at Pauley Pavilion on campus. The softball team plays on campus at 
Easton Stadium. Down the hill, the waterpolo teams as well as the swim 
and dive team compete at Spieker Aquatics Center. For baseball, there is 
the Steele Field at the Jackie Robinson Stadium, located close to campus.

As of December 2015, UCLA has won 113 NCAA team championships, and 133 
total national team championships—more than any other university.[2][3][14] 
The ten most recent championships came on December 6, 2015 (10th men's 
water polo title: defeated crosstown rival USC, 10–7), December 7, 2014 
(9th men's water polo title: defeated crosstown rival USC, 9–8), May 20, 
2014 (2nd women's tennis title), December 8, 2013 (1st women's soccer team 
championship); June 25, 2013 (1st men's baseball team title); December 
17, 2011 (4th women's volleyball team title); May 21, 2011 (3rd women's 
golf team title); June 2010 (11th women's softball team title); April 24, 
2010 (6th women's gymnastics team title); and May 10, 2009 (7th women's 
water polo team title: defeated crosstown rival USC, 5–4[15]). UCLA also 
secured three NCAA championships during the month of May 2008: on May 11, 
2008 when UCLA defeated archrival USC, 6–3, for the Women's Water Polo 
Championship,[16] on May 20, 2008 when the Bruins defeated California for 
the Women's Tennis Championship,[17] and on May 31, 2008 when UCLA defeated 
archrivals Stanford and USC for the Men's Golf Championship.[18] On May 
13, 2007, UCLA became the first school to win 100 NCAA championships, defeating 
Stanford, 5-4, for the 2007 Women's Water Polo Championship. In the following 
2007–08 sports season, some UCLA sports teams commemorated this achievement 
by replacing the blue letter 'C' on their uniforms with a gold 'C' ('C' 
being the Roman numeral for 100). UCLA has 113 NCAA team national championships.[19] 
The 2010 team, under head coach John Savage, won the Los Angeles Regional 
and Super-Regional, and was the first team to win 48 games in a season. 
The Bruins joined seven other teams in the 2010 College World Series and 
finished in second place, behind the University of South Carolina Gamecocks.[20] 
The 2011 team won the Pac-10 Conference title. The 2013 team won UCLA's 
109th NCAA Championship and their first in baseball in the 2013 College 
World Series by beating Mississippi State 3-1 and 8-0. Many UCLA baseball 
players have gone on to play in Major League Baseball (MLB). In the 2009 
World Series, Chase Utley hit two home runs to help the Philadelphia Phillies 
win Game 1. There were a total of four former UCLA baseball players in 
the 2009 playoffs: Philadelphia's Ben Francisco and Chase Utley, Pittsburgh's 
Garrett Atkins, and St. Louis' Troy Glaus, who was the 2002 World Series 
MVP for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Chris Chambliss and Gerrit Cole 
were No. 1 overall picks in the MLB drafts. Trevor Bauer was drafted as 
the No. 3 pick by the Arizona Diamondbacks on June 6, 2011. Former UCLA 
shortstop Brandon Crawford hit a grand-slam home run in his major-league 
debut with the San Francisco Giants on May 27, 2011 and helped the Giants 
to win the 2012 Major League World Series. Cole debuted with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates by winning his first four games he pitched and also drove in two 
runs with a single in his first at-bat in the 2013 major league. Several 
of the most revered championships were won by the Men's Basketball team 
under coaches John Wooden and Jim Harrick. The rich legacy of UCLA basketball 
has produced 11 NCAA championships – 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 
1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, and 1995. From 1971 to 1974, UCLA men's basketball 
won an unprecedented 88 consecutive games, a record that many sports pundits 
considered unbreakable. (However, on December 21, 2010, Geno Auriemma led 
the University of Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team to their 
89th consecutive victory;[21] their streak ended at 90 wins.)[22][23] Past 
rosters of UCLA basketball teams have included greats such as Rafer Johnson 
who was the 1960 Olympic Decathlon Champion, Gail Goodrich, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 
(then known as Lew Alcindor), Bill Walton, Reggie Miller and Walt Hazzard. 
The Bruins also had a winning record for 54 consecutive seasons from the 
1948–1949 season to the 2001–2002 season.[24] In recent years, UCLA Men's 
Basketball has returned to prominence under Coach Ben Howland. Between 
2006 and 2008, UCLA has been to three consecutive Final Fours, while UCLA's 
players have received numerous awards, most notably Arron Afflalo, a 2007 
First-Team All American and the Pac-10 Player of the Year, and Kevin Love, 
a 2008 First-Team All American and the Pac-10 Player of the Year.[25] UCLA 
has produced the most NBA Most Valuable Player Award winners, six of them 
by Abdul-Jabbar and one by Walton, who was Abdul-Jabbar's successor.[26] 
In March 2013, UCLA relieved head men's basketball coach Ben Howland of 
his duties after UCLA dropped an 83-63 decision to Minnesota in a second-round 
game of the NCAA Tournament. The current head coach is Steve Alford, former 
coach at New Mexico and Iowa. He won a NCAA championship as a player under 
Bobby Knight at Indiana. In the 1977-78 season, the women's basketball 
team, with a 27–2 record, were the AIAW Champions under head coach Billie 
Moore. The 2014-15 team won the 2015 WNIT championship by defeating the 
West Virginia Mountaineers 62–60 on April 4, 2015. In 1954, the UCLA football 
team earned a share of the national title with a 9–0 record and a #1 ranking 
in the UPI football poll, while Ohio State was ranked #1 in the AP Poll. 
Owing to rules in place at the time, UCLA was unable to face off against 
Ohio State in the Rose Bowl, which would have resulted in one or the other 
being declared national champion. The Bruins have played in the Rose Bowl 
Game 12 times, winning 5 of them. The Bruins have won or shared the conference 
title 17 times. Among the many former UCLA football stars are Jackie Robinson 
(better known for his exploits as a baseball player, but nevertheless a 
4-sport letterman and All-American), Heisman Trophy winner Gary Beban, 
Bob Waterfield, Troy Aikman, Carnell Lake, and Tommy Maddox. One of the 
great moments in recent history for the Bruins came on December 2, 2006, 
when they beat USC 13–9 in one of the greatest upsets in the rivalry. The 
Bruins are the Pac-12 Conference South Division Champions for two years 
in a row and played in both the 2011 and 2012 Pac-12 Football Championship 
Games. UCLA became the first school to have a top winner in both basketball 
and football in the same year with Gary Beban winning the Heisman Trophy 
and Lew Alcindor (now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) winning the U.S. Basketball 
Writers Association player of the year award in 1968. 15 football players 
and coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, 
John Sciarra being the latest inductee in the Class of 2014. A notable 
player and alumnus of the UCLA football team is current NCIS star, actor 
Mark Harmon. Winner of the "all-around excellence" award, Harmon led his 
team to victory several times as the quarterback. The current head Coach 
is Jim L. Mora. He went 9-5 in his first season as head coach and led the 
Bruins to a victory against USC for the first time since 2006 The UCLA 
Bruins men's golf team has won two NCAA Championships, in 1988 and 2008. 
In the 2008 national championship, the team was led by senior Kevin Chappell, 
who won the respective individual title. In that championship, UCLA won 
by one shot over USC, and by two shots over Stanford. In 2009, UCLA came 
first in the NCAA Central Regional, pulling off their third regional championship 
in the last seven years. With that victory, the defending national champions, 
advanced to their seventh consecutive NCAA Championship, a school record. 
For 2011, the Bruins were first in stroke play before losing in the match 
play of the national championship tournament; and freshman golfer Patrick 
Cantlay was named GCAA Division I Jack Nicklaus National Player of the 
Year Award, the fourth player from UCLA.[27] Cantlay was also the National 
Freshman of the Year, winning the Phil Mickelson Award in addition to being 
the Pac-10 Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year.[28] Chappell won 
National Player of the Year in 2008, Corey Pavin in 1982 and Duffy Waldorf 
in 1985. At the 2011 U.S. Open, Chappell was the low American (tie with 
Robert Garrigus) and Cantlay was the low amateur. The team has won five 
Pac-12 Conference championships: 1982, 1983, 1985, 2003, 2006 and has had 
numerous individual conference champions the first of which was Peter Laszlo 
in 1970. The women's team won the national championship in 1971 (DGWS), 
1991, 2004 and 2011. In 2014, sophomore Alison Lee won the inaugural ANNIKA 
Award, which was created to honor the women's collegiate player of the 
year as chosen by a vote of coaches, college golfers, and members of the 
media. [29] In 2016, junior Bronte Law won the prestigious award as well. 
[30] The women's program also has many notable professional alumnae on 
tour, including British Open Champion Mo Martin, Sydnee Michaels, and Mariajo 
Uribe. Former Bruin golf professionals include Scott McCarron, John Merrick, 
Corey Pavin, and Duffy Waldorf. Bruin alum Brandt Jobe tied for second

1934, UCLA Rugby is one of the historically great college rugby teams.[47] 
UCLA won 3 national championships,[47] and amassed a 362-46-2 record from 
1966-1982,[48][49] but the program lost its varsity status in 1982.[50] 
The Bruins play Division 1 college rugby in the PAC Rugby Conference. The 
Bruins are led by head coach Scott Stewart, who formerly played international 
rugby for Canada.[51] UCLA rugby has been steadily improving in recent 
years. UCLA finished the 2010-11 season ranked 25th in the country.[52] 
In the 2011-12 season UCLA placed second in the Pacific Conference, reached 
the quarterfinals of the 2012 men's national playoffs,[51] and finished 
the season ranked 11th in the nation.[53] During the 2012-13 season, UCLA 
finished second in the PAC conference, highlighted by a 50-38 win over 
#6 ranked Utah,[54] which propelled UCLA into a top 10 position in the 
national rankings. UCLA — along with fellow PAC schools Cal and Utah — 
was one of the original 8 teams to form the Varsity Cup, which began play 
in 2013.[47] UCLA reached the quarterfinals of the 2015 Varsity Cup, before 
losing to eventual champions BYU.[55] UCLA has also been successful in 
rugby sevens. UCLA reached the quarterfinals of the 2012 Las Vegas Invitational 
college rugby sevens tournament.[56] UCLA defeated Arizona State to finish 
third at the 2012 PAC 7s tournament.[57] UCLA defeated Dartmouth to reach 
the semifinals of the 2013 Collegiate Rugby Championship at PPL Park in 
Philadelphia in a tournament broadcast live on NBC.[58] UCLA again reached 
the semifinals of the 2014 Collegiate Rugby Championship, before losing 
17–20 to eventual champions Cal.[59] UCLA won the 2014 West Coast 7s with 
a 14–12 upset victory over Cal in the final.[60] Mark Harmon, Lynn "Buck" 
Compton, Jackie Robinson, Rafer Johnson, Walt Hazzard, Gail Goodrich, Troy

Reggie Miller, Troy Glaus, Tim Daggett, Baron Davis, Stacey Nuveman, Lisa 
Fernandez, Amanda Freed, Tairia Flowers, Donna de Varona, Cobi Jones, Lauren 
Cheney, Sydney Leroux and Ann Meyers are just some of the notable athletic 
alumni. Its coaches have included Red Sanders, Tommy Prothro, Dick Vermeil, 
Terry Donahue, Al Scates, Adam Krikorian, Jonathan Bornstein, Andy Banachowski, 
Jim Harrick, and John Wooden. In addition to the success of its collegiate 
sports program, UCLA is always well represented at the Olympics. In the 
2004 Athens games, UCLA sent 56 athletes, more than any other university 
in the country. At the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Bruins won 15 medals, 
including 4 gold, 9 silver, and 2 bronze. Additionally, five coaches came 
from UCLA: Jill Ellis (women's soccer, gold), Guy Baker (women's water 
polo, silver), Bob Alejo (men's beach volleyball, gold), Jeannette Boldon 
(women's track and field, multiple medals), and John Speraw (men's volleyball, 
gold). The Bruin mascots are Joe and Josephine Bruin. There have been a 
number of editions of the bruins over the years, with the happy bruins 
as the favorites of the fans. The mean ones were retired. One of the old 
mascots has been retired to the Bruin Hall of Fame. They have participated 
in other events for UCLA besides athletic events. In 1984, the UCLA Alumni 
Association celebrated its 50th anniversary by presenting "The Bruin" statue, 
located at Bruin Plaza, to the university (see picture above). It was billed 
as the largest bear sculpture in the United States, at 10 feet long, 6 
feet wide, 3 feet across and weighing more than 2 tons. The Solid Gold 
Sound of the UCLA Bruin Marching Band entertains the crowds at Bruin games. 
The school fight songs are "Sons of Westwood" and "The Mighty Bruins". 
The spirit squad includes the cheer squad, the dance team, and the yell 
crew in addition to the mascots. The UCLA alumni band is the official band 
of the gymnastics team at the school. UCLA shares a traditional sports 
rivalry with the nearby University of Southern California. This rivalry 
is relatively unique in NCAA Division I sports because both schools are 
located within the same city, Los Angeles. The Lexus Gauntlet was the name 
given to a now defunct competition between UCLA and the University of Southern 
California in the 18 varsity sports that both competed in head-to-head; 
in 2003, 2005, and 2007 UCLA won the Lexus Gauntlet Trophy, while the University 
of Southern California won the trophy in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2009. 
Competitions with official sponsorship were held from 2001 until the licensing 
contract ended in 2009. The annual football game features both teams vying 
for the Victory Bell. California and UCLA have meet annually on the football 
field since 1939.[62] Because UCLA was originally founded as the southern 
branch of the University of California, the series takes on the quality 
of a sibling rivalry.[63] The series was dominated early by Cal, followed 
by dominance by UCLA in the 50s until 80s, and has become more evenly matched 
recently. UCLA had a basketball rivalry with Notre Dame, with games played 
every year from 1966 to 1995.[64] After UCLA's victory on February 7, 2009, 
UCLA leads the all-time series 28-19.[65] The performance UCLA and Arizona 
influences the national opinion of the conference.[66] In conjunction with 
the opening of the J.D. Morgan Athletics Center in November 1983, UCLA 
established an athletics Hall of Fame with 25 charter members representing 
a cross-section of the school's athletic history. Each year, a minimum 
of one and a maximum of eight former UCLA athletes, coaches or administrators 
are added to the Hall of Fame. Upon its 23rd year of existence, The Hall 
of Fame was moved to a new location facing Westwood Plaza. The new Hall 
of Fame is now double in size after its renovation and expansion, which 
was completed in the Winter of 2000. The first floor in the east wing of 
the new J.D. Morgan Athletics Center features the 8,000-square-foot (740 m2) 
Athletics Hall of Fame and serves as the main entrance to the Department 
of Intercollegiate Athletics. From 1993 to 1999 the school had an apparel 
contract with Reebok. In 1999, an agreement was reached with Adidas for 
six years, ending in June 2005. The deal was to provide equipment and apparel 
to UCLA's 21 intercollegiate teams. Additional terms of the deal included 
internship opportunities for UCLA students and an exclusive licensee for 
athletic replica wear.[67] The reported monetary terms of the agreement 
included $1.625 million in cash and $1.3 million in equipment each year. 
In 2005, the deal was renewed for $2.6 million in cash and $1.6 million 
in equipment. Additional terms included one full-time Adidas employee on 
the UCLA campus, $2,500 each year for a "non-UCLA charitable" project selected 
by the Football or Basketball head coach, game tickets for Adidas executives, 
radio acknowledgements during games, and appearances by the Football and 
Basketball head coaches at Adidas events.[68] In April 2010, a letter of 
intent to renew was reached between UCLA Athletics and Adidas.[69] By June 
of that same year the terms of the deal were finalized but not published.[70] 
In a report, UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero stated that the deal is 
for seven years and "will approach" the deal Adidas has with Michigan worth
