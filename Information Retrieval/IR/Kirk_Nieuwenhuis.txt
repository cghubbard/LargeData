Kirk Robert Nieuwenhuis, also known sometimes as Captain Kirk or Nieuwy 
(born August 7, 1987) is an American professional baseball outfielder for 
the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played 
for the New York Mets and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Nieuwenhuis attended 
Denver Christian High School in Lakewood, Colorado where he played football, 
basketball and baseball. As a football player, Nieuwenhuis was an elusive 
running back who led Denver Christian to a state championship and received 
scholarship offers from Colorado, Colorado State and Air Force.[1] However, 
Nieuwenhuis feared that he lacked the size to succeed as a football player 
at the next level and that he would be converted to a wide receiver and 
made to redshirt as a freshman. He therefore decided to focus on baseball.[2] 
As a high school baseball player, Nieuwenhuis was a lightly recruited second 
baseman and pitcher whose fastball reached 90 miles per hour.[1][2] Nieuwenhuis 
played three seasons of baseball at Azusa Pacific University in Azusa, 
California. There he led the Cougars to back-to-back NAIA World Series 
appearances in 2007 and 2008 and set school career records in runs scored, 
with 190, and triples, with 12.[3] Nieuwenhuis was drafted by the New York 
Mets in the third round of the 2008 Major League Baseball draft out of 
the Azusa Pacific University. In the minors, Nieuwenhuis primarily was 
a center fielder, and after hitting .298 in Triple-A Buffalo, Nieuwenhuis 
was added to the Mets 40 man roster on November 18, 2011.[4] After performing 
well during his debut with the Mets, Nieuwenhuis garnered the moniker "Captain 
Kirk" from Mets fans, in reference to the fictional Captain Kirk from the 
1960s television series Star Trek. Nieuwenhuis began his professional career 
with the Brooklyn Cyclones in the New York–Penn League, where he played 
74 games and hit .277. Nieuwenhuis had 15 doubles, five triples and three 
home runs among 79 hits in 319 plate appearances. Following his first professional 
season, Nieuwenhuis continued to play well throughout the Mets' Minor League 
system. He played at every level, finishing the 2010 campaign at Triple-A 
Buffalo. In 2011, Nieuwenhuis was shut down with a torn labrum in his non-throwing 
shoulder. It cost him most of the second half of his season. Nieuwenhuis 
was called up by the Mets on April 7, 2012, to replace the injured Andrés 
Torres.[5] Nieuwenhuis got his first major league hit, an infield single, 
on the same day he was called up; Nieuwenhuis finished the day 2-4.[6] 
On April 9, in only his second start and third major league game, Nieuwenhuis 
hit his first Major League home run against Nationals pitcher Edwin Jackson. 
On April 27, he hit a walk-off single against the Miami Marlins off of 
Marlins closer Heath Bell giving the Mets the series sweep against the 
Marlins. Though he garnered early National League Rookie of the Year consideration 
for his .297 average, six home runs and superlative outfield defense through 
June 15, Nieuwenhuis batted .123 with one home run after that date, striking 
out in more than 44 percent of his plate appearances.[7] By July 28, Nieuwenhuis 
was batting .252 with 7 home runs and 28 RBIs and on July 30, he was optioned 
to the Mets Triple-A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons, to make way for Mike 
Baxter and Jason Bay who were coming off of the disabled list.[8] On August 
6 while with Buffalo, Nieuwenhuis was diagnosed with a partial tear of 
the plantar fascia in his right foot, which occurred while running down 
the first-base line just days after being optioned by the Mets.[9] He reported 
to Port St. Lucie for rehab, then on August 22, he was shut down for the 
rest of the season to heal his foot.[10] Through 91 games and 282 at bats, 
Niewenhuis was batting .252 with 7 home runs and 28 RBIs, while playing 
the outfield for the Mets. In late April, Nieuwenhuis was demoted to the 
Triple-A Buffalo Bisons after hitting 2 for 16 for the Mets in April. However, 
he was called back up to the Mets to take Rick Ankiel's spot on the roster. 
Nieuwenhuis had been hitting .232 at Triple-A before his promotion. On 
June 10, 2013, Nieuwenhuis was again called up to the Mets playing center 
field.[11] Nieuwenhuis played in 61 games with the Mets in 2014. Over 112 
at-bats he hit .259 with an .828 OPS and three home runs. Nieuwenhuis was 
designated for assignment on May 19, 2015.[12] Nieuwenhuis was traded to 
the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for cash considerations on May 27, 2015.[13] 
He was designated for assignment on June 10.[14] Nieuwenhuis was claimed 
by the New York Mets 17 days after the Mets traded him to the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim.[15] Nieuwenhuis was sent to the Las Vegas 51s and was 
later promoted back to the New York Mets on July 6, 2015. On July 12, 2015, 
he hit three home runs in a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.[16] 
He was the first player to accomplish this at Citi Field. He is the tenth 
player in franchise history to hit three home runs in one game and the 
first to do so in a Mets' home game. When interviewed after his exceptional 
game that day, Kirk commented in response to his critics: "there's more 
to life than baseball".[17] On July 29, Lucas Duda joined Nieuwenhuis as 
the second Met to accomplish the feat at home. On September 8, 2015, Nieuwenhuis 
hit a pinch-hit, go-ahead home run of Jonathon Papelbon of the Nationals, 
breaking an eighth inning tie and handing the Mets an 8-7 win, a game in 
which the Mets had once trailed 7-1. After their third consecutive comeback 
win the next day, the Mets swept the Nats, moving themselves to 7.0 games 
ahead in the NL East. On December 23, 2015, Nieuwenhuis was claimed by 
the Milwaukee Brewers off of waivers.[18] Nieuwenhuis is one of nine players
