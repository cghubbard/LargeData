John H. Johnson (September 26, 1921 â€“ January 12, 1988) was an American 
baseball executive, whose most significant role was as president of the 
National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues from 1979 through 
1988. He was born in Staten Island, New York.[1][2] Johnson was credited 
with helping the then struggling organization stablize and grow. During 
his ten-year tenure, he was in charge of 17 minor league circuits and 176 
teams throughout the United States. One of his most important achievements 
was an extensive overhaul of the master player development contract, which 
governs the relations between Major League Baseball organizations and their 
mostly independently owned Minor League affiliates.[2] Johnson, whose strength 
was as an administrator, joined the New York Yankees organization in 1947, 
working for them during 24 years. He served initially as secretary to the 
general manager George Weiss. Johnson was later promoted as general manager 
of the Double-A Binghamton Triplets farm club, traveling secretary for 
the Yankees, and finally as vice president for Minor League operations.[3] 
When Bowie Kuhn was elected baseball commissioner in 1969, Johnson joined 
his office staff for the next eight years. Following his stint as administrator 
for Kuhn, Johnson was unanimously elected as president of the National 
Association of Professional Baseball Leagues at the Winter Meetings held 
in 1978, succeeding Bobby Bragan. Johnson received a five-year contract 
extension in 1981 and was re-elected to a three-year term in 1986.[3] With 
Johnson at the helm, the NAPBL attendance soared to more than 20 million 
fans in 1987, a figure not matched since the 1953 season.[4] Johnson was 
diagnosed with chest cancer in September 1987. He was a long time resident 
of St. Petersburg, Florida, where he died in January 1988 at the age of 
66.[2] The President's Award is considered one of the most prestigious 
recognitions given by Minor League Baseball and is granted annually. The 
award was first presented in 1974, and was created to honor the complete 
Minor League franchise, based on franchise stability, contributions to 
league stability, contributions to baseball in the community, and promotion 
of the baseball industry. The trophy was renamed The John H. Johnson President's
