Jacob Joseph Arrieta (born March 6, 1986) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously 
played for the Baltimore Orioles. In 2015, Arrieta won the National League 
Cy Young Award, was the MLB wins leader, pitched a no-hitter, and set a 
major league record at 0.75 earned run average (ERA) for the lowest second-half 
ERA.[1][2] Arrieta's 2015 season has been widely compared to Bob Gibson's 
1968 season in which Gibson won the National League MVP and Cy Young Awards 
after posting a live-ball era record 1.12 ERA.[3][4][5][6][7][8] On April 
21, 2016 Arrieta threw his second no-hitter, against the Cincinnati Reds, 
the only one of the 2016 regular season. Born in Farmington, Missouri, 
Arrieta grew up in Plano, Texas, and attended Plano East Senior High School. 
As a high school senior he was selected by the Cincinnati Reds in the 31st 
round of the 2004 draft, but instead chose to attend college.[9][10] He 
attended Weatherford Junior College for his freshman year posting a 6–2 
win-loss record with a 3.58 earned run average (ERA).[9] Following his 
freshman year, Arrieta was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 26th 
round of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft but instead opted to transfer 
to Texas Christian University where he played for the Horned Frogs baseball 
team for his sophomore and junior seasons and studied sport psychology.[9][11] 
During the summer of 2005, prior to enrolling at TCU, Arrieta participated 
in summer collegiate baseball with the McKinney Marshalls of the Texas 
Collegiate League and posted a 4–3 record in 10 starts with a 1.87 ERA 
over 62.2 innings pitched.[9] During his sophomore year, Arrieta led college 
baseball with 14 wins and had a 2.35 ERA over 19 appearances.[11] He also 
won the Mountain West Conference Pitcher of the Year award and was named 
a Second-Team College Baseball All-American after his sophomore year.[12] 
Arrieta first joined the United States national baseball team in 2006 and 
helped the team win the World University Baseball Championship in Cuba. 
He was 4–0 with 34 strikeouts and a 0.27 ERA—allowing just one earned run 
in 35 innings pitched over six starts for the team.[13] In his first start 
at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Arrieta pitched six innings and struck out 
seven in Team USA's 9–1 victory over the China national baseball team.[14] 
Arrieta was selected by the Baltimore Orioles in the fifth round of the 
2007 Major League Baseball draft and received a $1.1 million signing bonus, 
which at the time was the largest signing bonus for a fifth round draft 
pick.[15][16][17] Arrieta made his professional debut in the Arizona Fall 
League with the Phoenix Desert Dogs in 2007. He posted 16 scoreless innings, 
while striking out 16 over 14 appearances, and helped lead the Desert Dogs 
to the Arizona League championship.[17][18] Arrieta was 6–5 with a 2.87 
earned run average and 120 strikeouts over 113 innings for the Frederick 
Keys of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League when his season ended in order 
to allow him to play for the USA Baseball team at the 2008 Summer Olympics 
in Beijing.[19][20] Arrieta made his major league debut on June 10, 2010, 
against the New York Yankees at Camden Yards. He pitched six innings, giving 
up four hits and three runs, striking out six and earning the win.[21] 
He started the home openers for the Orioles in 2011 and 2012. Both starts 
resulted in victories for the Orioles. After starting the 2012 season 3–9 
with an ERA of 6.13, Arrieta was demoted to Triple-A on July 6, 2012.[22] 
Arrieta began the 2013 season with four starts for the Orioles posting 
a 1–1 record and a 6.63 ERA until being sent down to the Triple-A Norfolk 
Tides on April 22, 2013 after the Orioles recalled Alex Burnett.[23][24] 
He was recalled by the Orioles on May 18, and then later optioned back 
down to Triple-A to make room for Kevin Gausman on May 23.[23][25] He was 
recalled again on June 14 and Gausman was optioned to Triple-A to make 
room on the roster for Arrieta.[26] Through four years with the Orioles, 
Arrieta posted a record of 20–25 and a 5.46 ERA.[27] On July 2, 2013, the 
Orioles traded Arrieta along with Pedro Strop to the Chicago Cubs for Scott 
Feldman and Steve Clevenger.[28] He was optioned to the Iowa Cubs of the 
Class AAA Pacific Coast League upon being acquired. After making 5 starts 
for Iowa, Arrieta was recalled to start Game 2 of a doubleheader against 
the Brewers on July 30. In his Chicago debut, he gave up 1 run in 6 innings, 
earning a no-decision in the 3–2 loss.[29] After the game, Arrieta was 
optioned to Iowa where he made 2 more starts before being recalled on August 
14 to replace Carlos Villanueva in the rotation. He made eight more starts 
before the end of the season. In his nine starts with Chicago, he went 
4–2 with a 3.66 ERA, striking out 37 in 51.2 innings. In 30 games (29 starts) 
in 2013 including the minors, Arrieta went 12–9 with a 4.42 ERA, striking 
out 137 in 154.2 innings. Three times in 2014 he took no-hitters into the 
seventh or eighth innings.[30] On June 24, Arrieta retired the first 18 
Reds in order, but the perfect game was broken up by Cincinnati's Billy 
Hamilton's leadoff double in the seventh. On June 30, 2014, against the 
Red Sox, Arrieta took a no-hitter into the 8th until Stephen Drew singled 
to lead off the inning.[31] As of September 24, 2014, he had posted a 10–5 
record with a 2.53 ERA. In 156.2 innings he gave up 114 hits, walked 41, 
and struck out 167. On July 12, 2015, Arrieta pitched a complete game victory 
over the Chicago White Sox at Wrigley Field, his second complete game of 
the season and the third of his major league career.[32][33] On August 
20, Arrieta became the first MLB pitcher to win 15 games in the 2015 season.[34] 
Ten days later, Arrieta no-hit the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium 
for the 14th no-hitter in Cubs history. He struck out 12 batters, including 
all three batters he faced in both the first and ninth innings. Sandy Koufax 
had been the last pitcher to complete a no-hitter by striking out all three 
batters he faced in the ninth inning, doing so against the Cubs in his 
1965 perfect game—a game also played at Dodger Stadium.[35] Arrieta was 
named the NL Player of the Week for August 24–30 and NL Pitcher of the 
Month for August with a 6−0 and a 0.43 ERA and the no-hitter. The right-hander 
held opposing hitters to a .130 batting average and a .196 on-base percentage 
in August and struck out 43 batters while walking just 10.[36][37] On September 
22, Arrieta won his 20th game of the season, throwing a three-hitter against 
the Brewers.[38] With 11 more strikeouts in that 4-0 Cubs victory at Wrigley, 
he was the first MLB pitcher to win 20 games this season and had his 4th 
complete game and 3rd shutout of the season. After the 2015 All-Star break, 
he gave up 9 earned runs during 15 starts over 107 1/3 innings for a 0.75 
ERA, the lowest in MLB history in the second half.[39] For the season, 
Arrieta's 22–6 record and 1.77 ERA made him only the fifth pitcher to win 
at least 22 games with no more than six losses and a sub-2.00 ERA since 
the earned run became an official stat in 1913.[40] On October 5, he was 
again named NL Pitcher of the Month for his 4–0 September record with a 
0.45 ERA.[41] Arrieta pitched a complete-game shutout, striking out eleven 
batters and allowed only four hits to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates 4–0 
in the 2015 National League Wild Card Game.[42] He became the first pitcher 
to post a postseason shutout while striking out at least 10 batters and 
walking zero.[43] He is also the first pitcher to have more stolen bases 
than runs scored in a postseason game when he stole second base in the 
top of the 7th. Arrieta was the pitcher of record in the Game 2 loss of 
the 2015 National League Championship Series to the New York Mets.[citation 
needed] On November 18, 2015, Arrieta won the NL Cy Young Award to become 
the first Cubs pitcher to do so since Greg Maddux in 1992.[44] He is the 
fifth Cubs winner overall, also joining Fergie Jenkins (1971), Bruce Sutter 
(1979) and Rick Sutcliffe (1984).[45] On February 5, 2016, Arrieta and 
the Cubs agreed on a record arbitration deal worth $10.7 million 2016 salary, 
the largest one-year contract for a second-time arbitration eligible pitcher, 
topping David Price's $10.1 million salary in 2013.[46] The club chose 
him as the 2016 season Opening Day starting pitcher against the Angels 
on April 4, 2016.[47] On April 21, 2016, Arrieta pitched his second career 
no-hitter and the 15th no-hitter in Cubs history against the Cincinnati 
Reds in a 16–0 blowout win. He walked four and struck out six.[48] Arrieta, 
who at the time of the no-hitter had not recorded a loss in his last 17 
regular-season starts, became only the second MLB pitcher ever to go unbeaten 
(in regular-season play) between no-hitters, with the only other being 
Johnny Vander Meer, who threw consecutive no-hitters in 1938.[49] The Arizona 
Diamondbacks defeated Arrieta and the Cubs 3–2 on June 5, even with 12 
strikeouts in his first five innings, stopping a 20-game regular season 
winning streak and giving him his first loss in 11 months.[50] In Game 
3 of the 2016 NLDS, Arrieta hit a three run home run off of San Francisco 
Giants' pitcher Madison Bumgarner, the first time that a pitcher hit a 
home run off of Bumgarner, which ended Bumgarner's consecutive playoff 
scoreless innings streak, of over 24 innings. Arrieta won Game 2 and Game 
6 of the 2016 World Series.[51] The Cubs won Game 7 of the series 8-7 in 
10 innings, giving them their first World Series title after a 108-year 
long drought.[52] Arrieta throws five different pitches. He throws a four-seam 
fastball, two-seam fastball, slider/cutter, curveball, and a changeup. 
His fastball averages around 95 miles per hour (153 km/h), sometimes reaching 
upper-90s mph. He relies on ground balls and swinging strikes.[53] His 
slider averages 88 miles per hour (142 km/h) with late break peaking out 
at 92 miles per hour (148 km/h) and his curve sits at 80 miles per hour 
(130 km/h) with two-plane break.[54] His changeup has tailing motion like 
a two-seam fastball and ranges from 86 to 89 miles per hour (138 to 143 km/h). 
Arrieta's great ability to generate movement on his pitches, as well as 
his unique mechanics make him nearly unhittable when his command is on. 
[55] Arrieta lives in Austin, Texas, during the offseason with his wife, 
Brittany, and their two children, Cooper and Palmer.[56] He is known as 
a "workout freak" and uses cross-training in his workouts.[57] Arrieta 
does pilates and incorporates kale juice, nuts, and fruits into his diet.[58][59][60] 
His maternal grandfather is of Puerto Rican ancestry whose parents are 
from the Basque Country, while his paternal grandmother is of Italian ancestry. 
Arrieta served as a groomsman for former TCU teammate Matt Carpenter's
