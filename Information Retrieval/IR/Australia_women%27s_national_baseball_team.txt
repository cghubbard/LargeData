The Australian women's national baseball team, also known as the Emeralds,[1] 
represents Australia in international women's baseball tournaments and 
competitions. The team is controlled by the Australian Baseball Federation,[2] 
which is represented in the Baseball Confederation of Oceania (BCO). They 
are the only team in Oceania to be formally ranked by the International 
Baseball Federation (IBAF), and are the 3rd ranked women's baseball team 
in the world.[3][4] The Emeralds have been in existence since 2001, when 
the first ever squad was selected from the 2001 National Women’s Championships, 
held in Sydney.[5] They compete in the biennial IBAF Women’s Baseball World 
Cup. The team has competed at all six Women's Baseball World Cups, most 
recently finishing third in 2014.[6] The next major tournament will be 
the 2016 Women's Baseball World Cup, which will be held in Gijang City, 
South Korea in September.[7] Infielders Outfielders Utility players Coaches

In August 2009 the International Baseball Federation created a ranking 
system so that the nations involved in international competition could 
be compared independently. Teams receive points based on the position they 
finish at the end of World Cup tournaments. Only results at the previous 
three tournaments years are used, so points are added and removed over 
time. Points are also weighted so that more recent tournaments have a greater 
impact on the rankings.[10] Since the rankings were introduced, two editions 
have been released, the most recent released after the 2010 World Cup. 
When the rankings were first introduced, Australia was listed at 4th position; 
their lowest since the rankings were introduced.[10] Their best position 
achieved to date is their current position of 3rd.[4] Of the twelve nations 
to be represented at the IBAF Women's Baseball World Cup, Australia is 
one of five teams to have participated in all four of them. To date its 
best result was in the most recent tournament held in 2010, in which Australia 
placed 2nd. Previously, the team had finished fourth in each of the tournaments, 
with medals being shared between Canada, Japan and United States.[11] At 
least one Australian has been named to each of the All-Star teams selected
