The Pittsfield Red Sox was the name of an American minor league baseball 
franchise based in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, from 1965 through 1969. It 
was the Double-A Eastern League affiliate in the Boston Red Sox farm system 
and produced future Major League Baseball players such as George Scott, 
Sparky Lyle, Reggie Smith and Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. The team played 
at Wahconah Park. The Berkshire city fielded its first team in Organized 
Baseball in 1894 when the Pittsfield Colts debuted in the New York State 
League, but the Colts folded after 30 games.[1] After the Pittsfield Electrics 
played two seasons (1913–1914) in the Class B Eastern Association, which 
folded after the 1914 campaign, Pittsfield was first represented in the 
Eastern League (then Class A) in 1919–1920 as the Hillies, and won the 
1919 EL pennant.[1] Pittsfield then fielded a team in the Class C Canadian–American 
League from 1941 through 1951 (although the league suspended operations 
for 1943–1945 due to World War II). This club, initially nicknamed the 
Electrics, was affiliated with the Detroit Tigers (1942), Cleveland Indians 
(1946–1950) and Philadelphia Phillies (1951). After 1948, it dropped the 
Electrics identity and was named after its parent club. The Can-Am League 
folded after the 1951 campaign, and Pittsfield was without representation 
in organized ball for the next 13 years. But after the 1964 season, Joe 
Buzas, owner of the Reading Red Sox, Boston's Double-A farm team, announced 
plans to move his franchise to Pittsfield. The 1965 Pittsfield club, managed 
by Eddie Popowski, proved to be a powerhouse. Led by Scott, who won the 
league's Triple Crown, and left-handed pitcher Billy MacLeod, a Gloucester, 
Massachusetts, native who had a perfect 18–0 season, the Red Sox won 85 
of 140 games and nipped the Elmira Pioneers (a Baltimore Orioles farm team 
managed by Earl Weaver) by a game for the EL pennant. Pittsfield also led 
the league in home attendance that season. Three years later, Pittsfield 
enjoyed another banner season when the 1968 Red Sox, managed by Billy Gardner, 
won 84 of 139 games and the regular-season title. That club was paced by 
future MLB infielders Luis Alvarado and Carmen Fanzone and included future 
MLB outfielder Billy Conigliaro. Attendance rose to a peak of 79,000 fans 
in 1969, but Buzas and the Red Sox decided to locate their Eastern League 
franchise closer to Boston, and moved the club to Pawtucket, Rhode Island, 
and McCoy Stadium in 1970. The Washington Senators moved quickly and replaced 
the Red Sox in 1970, and the Pittsfield Senators (later Rangers when the 
parent team moved to Dallas-Fort Worth) remained through 1975. The Milwaukee 
Brewers replaced the Rangers in 1976, and the team played a season as the 
Berkshire Brewers. With fan support at a new low — only 23,500 fans came 
through the turnstiles all season — the franchise moved to Holyoke, Massachusetts, 
as the Holyoke Millers, and Pittsfield was again left without baseball, 
this time for eight seasons. But in 1985, the Buffalo Bisons moved up from 
the EL to the Triple-A American Association, creating a need for an eighth 
Eastern League franchise, and the Chicago Cubs placed their Double-A affiliate 
in Wahconah Park. The Pittsfield Cubs played through 1988, fielding such 
players as Rafael Palmeiro and Mark Grace, and winning the 1987 regular 
season title. But the Cubs' attendance was mired at the bottom of the league. 
After 1988, the Eastern League reorganized, replacing Pittsfield and other 
under-performing franchises with new cities. However, Pittsfield continued 
to participate in professional baseball at a lower classification, in the 
Short Season Class A New York–Penn League (1989–2001) and in various independent
