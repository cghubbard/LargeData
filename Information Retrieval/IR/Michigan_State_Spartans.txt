The Michigan State Spartans are the athletic teams that represent Michigan 
State University. The school's athletic program includes 25 varsity sports 
teams. Their mascot is a Spartan warrior named Sparty, and the school colors 
are green and white. The university participates in the NCAA's Division 
I and the Football Bowl Subdivision for football. The Spartans participate 
as members of the Big Ten Conference in all varsity sports. Michigan State 
offers 12 varsity sports for men and 13 for women.[2] The university's 
athletic director is Mark Hollis, who was promoted to the position on January 
1, 2008.[3] Hollis replaced Ron Mason, who also served as head hockey coach 
from 1979 to 2002, retiring with a 608–261–68 record at MSU.[4] MSU's football 
team has won or shared six national championships in 1951, 1952, 1955, 
1957, 1965 and 1966, and has won the Rose Bowl in 1954, 1956, 1988 and 
2014.[5] Its men's basketball team won the NCAA National Championship in 
1979 and 2000.[5] The MSU men's ice hockey team won national titles in 
1966, 1986 and 2007.[5] In 1925, the institution changed its name to Michigan 
State College of Agriculture and Applied Science,[6] and, as an agricultural 
school, its teams were referred to as the Aggies. Looking to move beyond 
its agricultural roots, Michigan State held a contest to find a new nickname. 
They had decided to call the teams the "Michigan Staters" or the "Michigan 
State Sport Ons". MSU officials headed up by George S. Alderton and local 
sports writers for the Lansing State Journal and the Capital News went 
through the entries as well as met with longtime Michigan State University 
supporters to find a better and more heroic name. They decided on the "Spartans" 
suggested by Stephen G. Scofes and his two brothers Pete and Nick, all 
natives of Sparta, Greece. The three brothers met with MSU officials at 
their Lansing restaurant, The Coffee Cup, then renamed the Famous Grill, 
when they told them the story of the Spartan war at Thermopylae, Greece 
in 480 B.C., where 300 Spartan warriors held back thousands of Persian 
warriors led by Persia King, Xerxes. Today the Scofes family still honors 
the Michigan State men's Basketball and Football teams with trophies awarded 
to MSU players and faculty, since the banquets began in the Scofes families 
Coffee Cup and Famous Grill restaurants. This story was also highlighted 
in the popular book entitled, "The Tradition Continues" authored by Constantine 
and Steven Demos, page 56.[7] By coincidence, Justin Morrill had once compared 
the Land Grant colleges to the schools of ancient Sparta. With a heroic 
name and a historic precedent, the "Spartans" quickly caught on as the 
teams' new nickname. They later changed the lyrics of the Fight Song to 
reflect the name change of the College and its sports teams.[8] As the 
college grew, it looked to join a major collegiate conference. When the 
University of Chicago eliminated varsity football and withdrew from the 
Western Conference (now the Big Ten) in 1946, Michigan State president 
John A. Hannah lobbied to take its place. Despite opposition from the University 
of Michigan, the Big Ten admitted M.S.C. on May 20, 1949.[10] After joining 
the conference, head football coach Clarence L. "Biggie" Munn led the Spartan 
football team to the Rose Bowl in the 1953–54 season, beating UCLA 28–20.[11] 
Successor coach Hugh "Duffy" Daugherty carried the football team to a second 
Rose Bowl where it again defeated UCLA, 17–14.[12] Michigan State has 23 
NCAA Division I-A varsity teams: 11 varsity sports for men and 12 for women. 
They participate in the Big Ten Conference except fencing, where until 
1997, from the University founding, MSU featured fencing as a varsity sport. 
During that time, MSU was coached by the first American recognized as a 
master of fencing, Charles Schmitter, for 45 years, from 1939 to 1984. 
Upon his retirement, his student, Fred Freiheit, coached from 1984 until 
fencing was demoted from varsity status in 1997. The Michigan State University 
Fencing Club is a competing member of the Midwest Fencing Conference, which 
consists of sixteen (16) schools with varsity or club programs. Michigan 
State's men's basketball team has won the National Championship two times: 
in 1979 and 2000.[13] In 1979, Earvin "Magic" Johnson,[14] along with Greg 
Kelser,[15] Jay Vincent[16] and Mike Brkovich, carried the MSU team to 
a 75–64 win against the Larry Bird-led Indiana State Sycamores. In 2000, 
three players from Flint, Michigan, Morris Peterson,[17] Charlie Bell[18] 
and Mateen Cleaves,[19] carried the team to its second national title. 
Dubbed the "Flintstones", they were the key to the Spartans' win against 
Florida 89–76.[20] In addition to the two Championships, the 2008–09 team 
reached the NCAA Championship game, but lost to North Carolina 89–72.[21] 
Since 1995, Michigan State has been coached by Tom Izzo, who has a 524–205 
record.[22] Izzo's coaching helped the team make six of twelve NCAA Final 
Fours from 1999 to 2010, winning the title in 2000 and leading ESPN to 
define MSU as the best team in that decade.[23] Michigan State basketball 
has been selected for 19 consecutive NCAA tournament bids under Izzo. The 
Spartans have won one NCAA Championship, seven Big Ten Regular Season Championships, 
and five Big Ten Tournament Championships (the most of any team in the 
Big Ten) under Izzo. The team has made two NCAA Championship games and 
advanced to seven Final Fours, nine Elite Eights, and 13 Sweet Sixteens 
under Izzo. Overall, Michigan State has won 2 NCAA Championships, 13 Big 
Ten Regular Season Championships, and 5 Big Ten Tournament Championships. 
The Spartans have appeared in 3 NCAA Championship games, 9 Final Fours, 
13 Elite Eights, 19 Sweet Sixteens, and 29 NCAA Tournament appearances.[24] 
Spartans formerly or currently in the NBA include Maurice Ager, Alan Anderson, 
Charlie Bell, Shannon Brown, Mateen Cleaves, Paul Davis, Terry Furlow, 
Jamie Feick, Draymond Green, Johnny Green, Gary Harris, Earvin "Magic" 
Johnson, Greg Kelser, Mike Peplowski, Morris Peterson, Zach Randolph, Shawn 
Respert, Jason Richardson, Scott Skiles, Steve Smith, Eric Snow, Sam Vincent, 
Jay Vincent, and Kevin Willis. MSU also has a fairly successful women's 
basketball team, with its greatest accomplishment being a national runner-up 
finish to Baylor in 2005. MSU's women's basketball started in 1972–73 under 
coach Mikki Baile. The women's team has had five coaches in its history. 
The Spartans current coach is Suzy Merchant. The Spartans have made one 
National Championship game, one Final Four, one Elite Eight, three Sweet 
Sixteens, and appeared in 15 NCAA/AIAW Tournaments. Football has a long 
tradition at Michigan State. Starting as a club sport in 1884, football 
gained varsity status in 1896.[25] During that time, the Spartans had a 
roster of impressive players, including Lynn Chandnois, Dorne Dibble, Meredith 
Assaly, and Don McAulliffe. In 1951, the Spartans finished the season undefeated, 
and performed the same feat the following year in addition to the nation's 
longest winning streak of 24 games. The team was named the "undisputed 
national champions by every official poll".[26] After waiting for several 
years, the team was finally admitted into the Big Ten Conference as a regular 
member in 1953. They promptly went on to capture the league championship 
(losing only one game during the season) and beating UCLA in their first 
Rose Bowl game. After the 1953 season Biggie Munn, the legendary Spartan 
coach, turned the team over to his protégé and future legend Duffy Daugherty. 
Daughtery went on to win the 1956 Rose Bowl. George Perles was the head 
coach when the Spartans defeated USC in the 1988 Rose Bowl.[27] The current 
coach is Mark Dantonio, who was hired on November 27, 2006.[28] Dantonio 
has a 63–29 record in his coaching tenure as of the end of the 2013 season. 
Under Dantonio, MSU has won three Conference Championships, 2010, 2013, 
and 2015. The Spartans have won three Big Ten Divisional championships 
and two Big Ten Championship games during that period. In 2015, MSU was 
selected for the College Football Playoff as the No. 3 seed, but lost to 
Alabama in the Cotton Bowl.[29] He also led the Spartans to a victory in 
the 2014 Rose Bowl, the 100th edition of the "Grandaddy of them all."[30] 
All told, Michigan State has won six national championships and nine Big 
Ten championships.[31] Today, the football team competes in Spartan Stadium, 
a renovated 75,005-person football stadium in the center of campus. MSU's 
traditional archrival is the Michigan, against whom they compete for the 
Paul Bunyan Trophy; MSU has a 23–34–1 record in the annual trophy game. 
The Spartans have won the trophy seven of the past eight years, as of 2015 
season.[32] Michigan State's rivalry game against Notre Dame, with whom 
they compete for the Megaphone Trophy was played every year until 2013. 
MSU's record in the trophy series against the Fighting Irish is 26–34–1. 
Notable MSU alumni who have played in the National Football League include 
Morten Andersen,[33] Plaxico Burress,[34] Andre Rison,[35] Derrick Mason,[36]

L. Rucker, Greg Jones, and Kirk Cousins. Michigan State has two varsity 
hockey teams: a men's ice hockey team and a women's field hockey team. 
Helen Knull is the head coach of the women's field hockey team. The men's 
ice hockey team plays at the Munn Ice Arena. The head coach was Rick Comley, 
who had a 116–73–19 record at MSU.[49] The current head coach is Tom Anastos. 
In the 2013-2014 campaign, the Big Ten Conference debuted Division I ice 
hockey, (Michigan State formerly competed in the Central Collegiate Hockey 
Association with Big Ten sister schools University of Michigan (U-M) and 
the Ohio State University).[50] On October 6, 2001, the team was involved 
in what was then the most-attended hockey game in history: The Cold War. 
The Spartans set up a hockey rink in the middle of their football stadium, 
Spartan Stadium and played U-M before a crowd of 74,554. The game ended 
in a 3–3 tie.[51] A decade later, the same two teams were again involved 
in the most-attended ice hockey game in history. This time, Michigan hosted 
the rivalry game at its Michigan Stadium. The Big Chill at the Big House 
set the current record with an officially certified crowd of 104,173.[52] 
The MSU ice hockey program has seven CCHA regular season championships 
and 11 CCHA Tournament titles. MSU has also won 11 Great Lakes Invitational 
titles. The Spartans have been in the NCAA tournament 23 times, with nine 
Frozen Four appearances and three national titles (1966, 1986 and 2007). 
On April 7, 2007, the Michigan State Spartans won their third Collegiate 
Championship by beating the Boston College Eagles 3–1.[53] Former Michigan 
State players in the National Hockey League include Rod Brind'Amour,[54] 
Anson Carter,[55] Duncan Keith,[56] Donald McSween,[57] Adam Hall,[58] 
John-Michael Liles, Torey Krug, Shawn Horcoff, Justin Abdelkader, Jim Slater, 
brothers Kelly Miller[59] and Kip Miller,[60] as well as their cousins, 
brothers Ryan Miller[61] and Drew Miller.[62] Two players for MSU have 
won the Hobey Baker Award: Kip Miller in 1990 and Ryan Miller in 2001.[63] 
Few other players also excelling in other leagues including forward Brock 
Radunske and defenseman Brad Fast. Historically, the Michigan State Cross 
Country men's team has been one of the school's most successful programs. 
Between World War I and World War II, Michigan State College competed in 
the Central Collegiate Conference, winning titles in 1926-1929, 1932, 1933 
and 1935. Michigan State also experienced success in the IC4A, at New York’s 
Van Cortlandt Park, winning 15 team titles (1933–1937, 1949, 1953, 1956–1960, 
1962, 1963 and 1968). Since entering the Big Ten in 1950, Michigan State 
has won 14 men’s titles (1951–1953, 1955–1960, 1962, 1963, 1968, 1970 and 
1971). Michigan State hosted the inaugural NCAA cross country championships 
in 1938 and every year thereafter through 1964 (except a one-year vacation 
in 1943 due to war). The Spartans won eight NCAA championships from 1930 
to 1959, including 1939, 1948, 1949, 1952, and 1955-1959 (minus 1957).[64][65][66] 
Walt Drenth is the current director of both the men's and women's cross 
country and track and field programs. After joining MSU in 2004, Drenth 
led the men's cross country team to a NCAA Championship bid during the 
2004 season. The women's cross country team also advanced to the NCAA Championship 
Meet after winning the Great Lakes Regional race.[67] Wrestling was one 
of the earliest sports formed at the Michigan Agricultural College. While 
the sport was dropped in 1906, it was reformed by the college 16 years 
later in 1922.[68] The school's wrestling team has won the NCAA Division 
I championship once, in 1967.[69] Its current coach, Tom Minkel, has produced 
33 All-Americans, 11 Big Ten Champions and one NCAA Champion currently 
in his 23rd season as the Spartans Head coach, and 25th as a coach.[70] 
The Spartan wrestling team competes on campus at the Jenison Field House 
which has a capacity of 5,017 people. Alumni and standout Spartan Wrestlers 
Gray Maynard & Rashad Evans are former UFC champions and currently ranked 
in the top-ten in their weight classes respectively.[71] Starting in the 
mid-2000s. the Spartan wrestling team started to decline. From 2004–2016, 
the team had one season better than .500 and finished in the bottom half 
of the Big Ten, including last on four occasions.[72] During the 2015 championship 
tournament, the team finished dead last with negative team points (-0.5) 
thanks to only one qualifier and an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Minkel 
announced that he would retire after the 2015-16 season. Michigan State 
University Spartan Wrestling team accomplishments: MSU has a number of 
other team sports. As in many other NCAA institutions, Michigan State has 
a baseball team for men and a softball team for women. Jake Boss Jr. is 
head coach of the MSU baseball team. Former Michigan State players in Major 
League Baseball include Kirk Gibson,[74] Steve Garvey,[75] Robin Roberts[76] 
and Mark Mulder.[77] Since 2007, the baseball team plays a popular annual 
exhibition game against the nearby minor-league Lansing Lugnuts. The MSU 
women's fastpitch softball team won the 1976 Women's College World Series 
to take the AIAW national title, the only team east of the Mississippi 
River to win the WCWS until Michigan did it in 2005. The team has appeared 
in six Women's College World Series, in 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977 and 
1981.[78] Its coach, Jacquie Joseph, has headed the program since 1994.[79] 
Since taking over the program, Joseph has helped bring MSU to a record 
of 445–372–1 and four NCAA Regional appearances.[80] The Spartans also 
have a men's soccer team, which won two back-to-back championships in 1967 
and 1968. They shared the 1968 title with the University of Maryland, College 
Park.[81] The men's coach is Damon Rensing, who is in his 6th year as head 
coach at Michigan State.[82] The men's soccer team battles Michigan annually 
in the Big Bear Trophy game, a series in which the Spartans lead 10-3-1 
against their in-state rival.[83] Coaching the women's team is Tom Saxton.[84] 
There is also a volleyball team; Cathy George has been the head coach of 
the women's volleyball team since 2005. During her first year at Michigan 
State, she led her team to a 12–18 record, including a 5–15, ninth-place 
finish in the conference standings.[85] There are a number of contact sports 
at MSU, including boxing and wrestling. MSU's boxing team won national 
titles in 1951 and 1955, although it is no longer an NCAA varsity sport.[86] 
Water sports at MSU include rowing and swimming. MSU's women's rowing coach 
is Matt Weise, who is in his tenth year as the Spartan crew coach. In his 
third year as MSU head coach, Weise coached the Spartans to a program-best 
sixth-place team finish at the NCAA Championship.[87] Matt Gianiodis is 
the head coach of both men and women's swimming and diving. In his four 
years as head coach, Spartan swimmers and divers have broken 14 varsity 
records.[88] Other sports at MSU include golf, gymnastics and tennis. Golf 
has had a long tradition at MSU. Hall of Fame Coach Bruce Fossum helped 
carry MSU to its first Big Ten title in 1969.[89] The Big Ten title would 
elude the Spartans until 2005, when arguably, the best team ever assembled, 
took home the rings in stellar fashion. Not only did the Spartans win the 
Big Ten Championship in 2005, but they captured two other titles along 
the way and rose all the way to #5 in the U.S. Casey Lubahn coaches the 
men's golf team.[89] A former assistant coach at Stanford University, this 
is his fourth year as a head coach.[90] Stacy Slobodnik-Stoll coaches the 
women's team. In the last ten seasons, she has brought the Spartans to 
nine straight NCAA regional appearances.[91] The men's gymnastics team 
at MSU won one national title, which they shared with the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1958.[92] In 2001, the MSU Board of Trustees 
disbanded the team in order to comply with Title IX regulations.[93] The 
women's team retained its varsity status. Its coach is Kathie Klages, who 
has had 16 winning seasons in a row.[94] In 2008, the team ranked 17th 
in the nation in the final season standings, the highest placement in program 
history. Gene Orlando is the coach of the men's tennis team. In his 17 
years as MSU head coach, Orlando has taken the Spartan men to four NCAA 
Championship singles qualifiers.[95] Coaching the women's team is Erica 
Perkins, a second-year head coach who, in her first year, led the Spartan 
women to a 12–11 record (2–8, Big Ten.)[96] The Michigan State University 
Rugby Football Club was founded in 1964.[97] Michigan State rugby has been 
steadily improving in college rugby in recent years. During the 2010–11 
season, the Spartans played in Division 2, finishing with a 10–3 record 
and qualifying for the playoffs.[98] The Spartans' success led to them 
moving up to Division 1–AA for the 2011–12 season.[99] For the 2012–13 
season, the Spartans once again moved to a higher level of competition—the 
Big Ten Universities D1–A conference, against traditional Big Ten rivals 
such as the University of Michigan and Ohio State University. The success 
of Spartan Rugby is greatly attributed to former head coach Dave Poquette, 
who had been coaching at Michigan State since 1992 and retired in 2013.[97] 
In 1992, thirty former Spartan athletes, coaches, and administrators were 
inducted into the MSU Athletics Hall of Fame as its charter class.[100] 
On October 1, 1999, the University opened its new Athletics Hall of Fame, 
in the Clara Bell Smith Student-Athlete Academic Center.[101] Michigan 
State has won 20 NCAA national team titles.[104] Below are 10 national
