George Michael Steinbrenner III (July 4, 1930 – July 13, 2010) was an American 
businessman who was the principal owner and managing partner of Major League 
Baseball's New York Yankees. During Steinbrenner's 37-year ownership from 
1973 to his death in July 2010, the longest in club history, the Yankees 
earned seven World Series titles and 11 pennants. His outspokenness and 
role in driving up player salaries made him one of the sport's most controversial 
figures. Steinbrenner was also involved in the Great Lakes and Gulf Coast 
shipping industry. Known as a hands-on baseball executive, Steinbrenner 
earned the nickname "The Boss". He had a tendency to meddle in daily on-field 
decisions, and to hire and fire (and sometimes re-hire) managers. Former 
Yankees manager Dallas Green gave him the derisive nickname "Manager George".[1] 
He died after suffering a heart attack in his Tampa home on the morning 
of July 13, 2010, the day of the 81st All-Star Game. Steinbrenner was born 
in Rocky River, Ohio,[2][3] the only son of Rita (née Haley) and Henry 
George Steinbrenner II. His mother was an Irish immigrant who had changed 
her name from O'Haley to Haley.[4] His father was of German descent[5][6] 
and had been a world-class track and field hurdler while at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, from which he graduated in engineering in 1927, 
first in his class and a distinguished scholar in Naval Architecture.[7][8][9] 
The elder Steinbrenner later became a wealthy shipping magnate who ran 
the family firm operating freight ships hauling ore and grain on the Great 
Lakes. George III was named after his paternal grandfather, George Michael 
Steinbrenner II.[7] Steinbrenner had two younger sisters, Susan and Judy.[7] 
Steinbrenner entered Culver Military Academy, in Northern Indiana, in 1944, 
and graduated in 1948. He received his B.A. from Williams College in 1952. 
While at Williams, George was an average student who led an active extracurricular 
life. He was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He was an accomplished 
hurdler on the varsity track and field team, and served as sports editor 
of The Williams Record, played piano in the band, and played halfback on 
the football team in his senior year.[10] He joined the United States Air 
Force after graduation, was commissioned a second lieutenant and was stationed 
at Lockbourne Air Force Base in Columbus, Ohio. Following honorable discharge 
in 1954, he did post-graduate study at The Ohio State University (1954–55), 
earning his master's degree in physical education. He met his wife-to-be, 
Elizabeth Joan (pronounced Jo-Ann) Zieg, in Columbus, and married her on 
May 12, 1956.[10] The couple had two sons, Hank and Hal, and two daughters, 
Jessica Steinbrenner and Jennifer Steinbrenner-Swindal. While studying 
at Ohio State, he served as a graduate assistant to legendary Buckeye football 
coach Woody Hayes. The Buckeyes were undefeated national champions that 
year, and won the Rose Bowl. Steinbrenner served as an assistant football 
coach at Northwestern University in 1955, and at Purdue University from 
1956 to 1957. Steinbrenner joined Kinsman Marine Transit Company in 1957, 
the Great Lakes shipping company that his great-grandfather Henry had purchased 
in 1901 from The Minch Transit Company, which was owned by a family relation, 
and renamed.[11] Steinbrenner worked hard to successfully revitalize the 
company, which was suffering hardship during difficult market conditions. 
In its return to profitability, Kinsman emphasized grain shipments over 
ore.[10] A few years later, with the help of a loan from a New York bank, 
Steinbrenner purchased the company from his family. He later became part 
of a group that purchased the American Shipbuilding Company, and, in 1967, 
he became its chairman and chief executive officer. By 1972, the company's 
gross sales were more than $100 million annually.[12] In 1960, against 
his father's wishes, Steinbrenner entered the sports franchise business 
for the first time with basketball's Cleveland Pipers, of the American 
Basketball League (ABL). Steinbrenner had hired John McClendon, who became 
the first African American coach in professional basketball and persuaded 
Jerry Lucas to join his team instead of the rival National Basketball Association.[13][14] 
The Pipers switched to the new professional ABL in 1961; the new circuit 
was founded by Abe Saperstein, owner of the Harlem Globetrotters. The league 
and its teams experienced financial problems, and McClendon resigned in 
protest halfway through the season; however, the Pipers had won the first 
half of a split season. Steinbrenner replaced McClendon with former Boston 
Celtics star Bill Sharman, and the Pipers won the ABL championship in 1961-62. 
The ABL folded in December 1962, just months into its second season. Steinbrenner 
and his partners lost significant money on the venture, but Steinbrenner 
paid off all of his creditors and partners over the next few years.[10] 
With his burgeoning sports aspirations put on hold, Steinbrenner turned 
his attention to the theatre. His involvement with Broadway began with 
a short-lived 1967 play, The Ninety Day Mistress, in which he partnered 
with another rookie producer, James Nederlander. Whereas Nederlander threw 
himself into his family's business full-time, Steinbrenner invested in 
a mere half-dozen shows, including the 1974 Tony Award nominee for Best 
Musical, Seesaw, and the 1988 Peter Allen flop, Legs Diamond.[15] The Yankees 
had been struggling during their years under CBS ownership, which had acquired 
the team in 1965. In 1972, CBS Chairman William S. Paley told team president 
E. Michael Burke the media company intended to sell the club. As Burke 
later told writer Roger Kahn, Paley offered to sell the franchise to Burke 
if he could find financial backing. Steinbrenner, who had participated 
in a failed attempt to buy the Cleveland Indians from Vernon Stouffer one 
year earlier,[16] was brought together with Burke by veteran baseball executive 
Gabe Paul. On January 3, 1973, Steinbrenner and minority partner Burke 
led a group of investors, which included Lester Crown, John DeLorean and 
Nelson Bunker Hunt, in purchasing the Yankees from CBS.[17] For years, 
the selling price was reported to be $10 million. However, Steinbrenner 
later revealed that the deal included two parking garages that CBS had 
bought from the city, and soon after the deal closed, CBS bought back the 
garages for $1.2 million. The net cost to the group for the Yankees was 
therefore $8.8 million.[18] The announced intention was that Burke would 
continue to run the team as club president. But Burke later became angry 
when he found out that Paul had been brought in as a senior Yankee executive, 
reducing his authority, and quit the team presidency in April 1973. (Burke 
remained a minority owner of the club into the following decade, but as 
fellow minority owner John McMullen stated, "There is nothing in life quite 
so limited as being a limited partner of George Steinbrenner."[19]) Paul 
was officially named president of the club on April 19. It would be the 
first of many high-profile departures with employees who crossed paths 
with "The Boss". At the conclusion of the 1973 season, two more prominent 
names departed: manager Ralph Houk, who resigned and took a similar position 
with the Detroit Tigers; and general manager Lee MacPhail, who became president 
of the American League. The 1973 off-season would continue to be controversial 
when Steinbrenner and Paul fought to hire former Oakland Athletics manager 
Dick Williams, who had resigned immediately after leading the team to its 
second straight World Series title. However, because Williams was still 
under contract to Oakland, the subsequent legal wrangling prevented the 
Yankees from hiring him. On the first anniversary of the team's ownership 
change, the Yankees hired former Pittsburgh Pirates manager Bill Virdon 
to lead the team on the field. "There is nothing in life quite so limited 
as being a limited partner of George Steinbrenner." Steinbrenner quickly 
became famous for his rapid turnover of management personnel. In his first 
23 seasons, he changed managers 20 times; Billy Martin alone was fired 
and rehired five times. He also employed 11 general managers over 30 years. 
He was equally famous for pursuing high-priced free agents and then feuding 
with them. In July 1978, Billy Martin famously said of Steinbrenner and 
his $3 million outfielder Reggie Jackson, "The two were meant for each 
other. One's a born liar, and the other's convicted." The comment resulted 
in Martin's first departure, though officially he resigned (tearfully), 
before Yankees President Al Rosen could carry out Steinbrenner's dictum 
to fire him. During the 1981 World Series, Steinbrenner provided a colorful 
backdrop to the Yankees' loss of the series. After a Game 3 loss in Los 
Angeles, Steinbrenner called a press conference in his hotel room, showing 
off his left hand in a cast and various other injuries that he claimed 
were earned in a fight with two Dodgers fans in the hotel elevator. Nobody 
came forward about the fight, leading to the belief that he had made up 
the story of the fight in order to light a fire under the Yankees.[20] 
After the series, he issued a public apology to the City of New York for 
his team's performance, while at the same time assuring the fans that plans 
to put the team together for 1982 would begin immediately.[21] He was criticized 
heartily by players and press alike for doing so, as most people felt losing 
in the World Series was not something requiring an apology.[22] Another 
notable Steinbrenner policy was his military-style grooming code: All players, 
coaches, and male executives were forbidden to display any facial hair 
other than mustaches (except for religious reasons), and scalp hair could 
not be grown below the collar. (Long sideburns and "mutton chops" were 
not specifically banned.) The policy led to some unusual and comical incidents. 
During the 1973 home opener against the Cleveland Indians, as the Yankees, 
caps removed, were standing at attention for the National Anthem, Steinbrenner, 
in the owner's box next to the New York dugout, noticed that several players' 
hair was too long for his standards. As he did not yet know the players' 
names, he wrote down the uniform numbers of the offenders (Thurman Munson, 
Bobby Murcer, and Sparky Lyle), and had the list, along with the demand 
that their hair be trimmed immediately, delivered to Houk. The order was 
reluctantly relayed to the players.[23] In 1983, at Steinbrenner's behest, 
Yankee coach Yogi Berra ordered Goose Gossage to remove a beard he was 
growing. Gossage responded by shaving away the beard but leaving a thick 
exaggerated mustache extending down the upper lip to the jaw line, a look 
Gossage still sports to this day. The most infamous incident involving 
facial hair occurred in 1991. Although Steinbrenner was suspended, the 
Yankee management ordered Don Mattingly, who was then sporting a mullet-like 
hair style, to get a hair cut. When Mattingly refused he was benched. This 
led to a huge media frenzy with reporters and talk radio repeatedly mocking 
the team. The WPIX broadcasting crew of Phil Rizzuto, Bobby Murcer, and 
Tom Seaver lampooned the policy on a pregame show with Rizzuto playing 
the role of a barber sent to enforce the rule. Mattingly would eventually 
be reinstated. Coincidentally, The Simpsons episode "Homer at the Bat", 
which was filmed earlier that year, included Mattingly as a guest star 
who is suspended from play by Mr. Burns for his sideburns being too long, 
despite shaving the area of his head above where side burns grow. In 1995, 
Mattingly again ran afoul of the policy when he grew a goatee. Steinbrenner 
publicly criticized him for it and Mattingly eventually trimmed it to a 
mustache.[citation needed] David Wells occasionally wore a goatee and informed 
the media he would be willing to pay any fine to do so.[citation needed] 
Another notable incident involving Steinbrenner's strict grooming policy 
involved the Yankees' acquisition of former Boston Red Sox center fielder 
Johnny Damon for the 2006 season. Damon was well known for his "Jesus-like" 
beard and shoulder-length hair during his time with the Red Sox. In being 
asked about conforming to New York's strict grooming code, Damon said, 
"Without a doubt, George Steinbrenner has a policy and I'm going to stick 
to it. Our policy with the Yankees is to go out there and win and we're 
going to try and bring another championship to them."[24] Steinbrenner 
later noted, "He looks like a Yankee, he sounds like a Yankee and he is 
a Yankee."[25] Damon claimed he was already planning on cutting his hair 
after the 2005 season.[26][27] The "convicted" part of Billy Martin's famous 
1978 "liar and convicted" comment referred to Steinbrenner's connection 
to Richard Nixon; in 1974, Steinbrenner pleaded guilty to making illegal 
contributions to Nixon's re-election campaign, and to a felony charge of 
obstruction of justice.[28] He was personally fined $15,000 and his company 
was assessed an additional $20,000. On November 27 of that year, MLB Commissioner 
Bowie Kuhn suspended him for two years, but later commuted it to fifteen 
months. Ronald Reagan pardoned Steinbrenner in January 1989, one of the 
final acts of his presidency. After the 1980 season, Steinbrenner made 
headlines by signing Dave Winfield to a 10-year, $23 million contract, 
making Winfield baseball's highest-paid player. In 1985, Steinbrenner derided 
Winfield's poor performance in a key September series against the Toronto 
Blue Jays: Where is Reggie Jackson? We need a Mr. October or a Mr. September. 
Winfield is Mr. May. My big guys are not coming through. The guys who are 
supposed to carry the team are not carrying the team. They aren't producing. 
If I don't get big performances out of Winfield, Griffey and Baylor, we 
can't win. This criticism eventually became somewhat of an anachronism, 
as many believed Steinbrenner made the statement following the 1981 World 
Series.[29] Part of that comment later led Ken Griffey Jr. to list the 
Yankees as one team he would never play for.[30] On July 30, 1990, Steinbrenner 
was banned permanently from day-to-day management (but not ownership) of 
the Yankees by MLB Commissioner Fay Vincent for paying a gambler named 
Howie Spira $40,000 to dig up "dirt" on Winfield. Winfield had sued the 
Yankees for failing to contribute $300,000 to his foundation, a guaranteed 
stipulation in his contract.[31] (Vincent originally proposed a 2-year 
suspension, but Steinbrenner wanted it worded as an "agreement" rather 
than a "suspension" to protect his relationship with the U.S. Olympic Committee; 
in exchange for that concession, Vincent made the "agreement" permanent.) 
After considerable negotiation with Vincent's office, Robert Nederlander, 
one of Steinbrenner's theatre partners and a limited partner in the Yankees 
organization, became the managing general partner.[32] After Nederlander 
resigned in 1992, he was succeeded by Joe Molloy, George's son-in-law.[33] 
In 2001, Winfield cited the Steinbrenner animosity as a factor in his decision 
to enter the Hall of Fame as a representative of his first team, the San 
Diego Padres, rather than the team that brought him national recognition, 
the Yankees.[34] Steinbrenner was reinstated in 1993. Unlike past years, 
he was somewhat less inclined to interfere in the Yankees' baseball operations. 
He left day-to-day baseball matters in the hands of Gene Michael and other 
executives, and allowed promising farm-system players such as Bernie Williams 
to develop instead of trading them for established players. Steinbrenner's 
having "got religion" (in the words of New York Daily News reporter Bill 
Madden) paid off. After contending only briefly two years earlier, the 
1993 Yankees were in the American League East race with the eventual champion 
Toronto Blue Jays until September. The 1994 Yankees were the American League 
East leaders when a players' strike wiped out the rest of the season. Similarly, 
a players' strike had in that instance aided their 1981 playoff effort.[20] 
In 1995 the team returned to the playoffs for the first time since 1981, 
and in 1996, they beat the Atlanta Braves in six games to win the World 
Series. They went on to Series wins in 1998, 1999, and 2000, and fell short 
of a fourth straight title in 2001 with a seventh-game loss to the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. The Yankees then made the playoffs every season through 2007. 
In 2003 they beat the Boston Red Sox to win the AL Pennant, but lost the 
World Series to the Florida Marlins, denying Steinbrenner—who had won the 
Stanley Cup in June of that year as part-owner of the New Jersey Devils—the 
distinction of winning championships in two major sports leagues in the 
same year.[35] The Yankees' demise was furthered by the postseason collapse 
of 2004. While leading the eventual World Champion Boston Red Sox three 
games to none (3-0) and 3 outs away from winning Game 4, the Red Sox stunned 
the Yankees and the baseball world by coming back to win Game 4 and then 
the next three games and sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals in the World 
Series. In 2008, the Yankees ended their post-season run with a third-place 
finish in the American League East. However, in 2009, the Yankees defeated 
the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series to win a 27th championship, 
seven of which had been won under Steinbrenner's ownership. From 2006 to 
his death, George Steinbrenner spent most of his time in Tampa, Florida. 
After the 2007 season and the decision not to bring back manager Joe Torre, 
Steinbrenner was in poor enough health that he officially retired and handed 
control of the Yankees to his sons Hank and Hal Steinbrenner. Hank in particular 
shows similar traits to his father.[36] After ceding day-to-day control 
of the team, Steinbrenner made few public appearances and gave no interviews. 
Associates and family members refused to comment on rampant speculation 
concerning his declining health, specifically rumors that he was suffering 
from Alzheimer's disease. The Yankees went to great lengths to prevent 
anyone outside Steinbrenner's immediate family and closest business associates 
from speaking to him, or even getting a glimpse of him on the rare occasions 
when he made an appearance at Yankee Stadium. Temporary curtains were set 
up to block views of his entry and exit routes, and no one was allowed 
near the vehicles transporting him. The press elevator carrying media members 
downstairs to the interview areas were shut down before he arrived, and 
again toward the end of the game while he departed.[37] Steinbrenner made 
a rare appearance in the Bronx on the field for the 79th All-Star Game 
on July 15, 2008. Wearing dark glasses, he walked slowly into the stadium's 
media entrance with the aid of several companions, leaning upon one of 
them for support. He later was driven out on to the field along with his 
son Hal at the end of the lengthy pre-game ceremony in which the All-Stars 
were introduced at their fielding positions along with 49 of the 63 living 
Hall of Famers.[38] In subsequent occasional visits to spring training, 
regular-season games, and other outings, he used a wheelchair.[39] On April 
13, 2010, Derek Jeter and Joe Girardi privately presented the first 2009 
World Series Championship ring to Steinbrenner in his stadium suite. He 
was "almost speechless", according to reports.[40] George Steinbrenner's 
estimated net worth was $1.15 billion in 2009 according to the Forbes 400 
List in Forbes magazine issued in September 2009.[41] George Steinbrenner 
was the first owner of a baseball team to sell cable TV rights (to MSG 
Network).[42] If one adds the $1.2 billion valuation of the 36% Yankees 
owned YES Network to the team revenue (the other 64% is owned by Goldman 
Sachs and the former New Jersey Nets owner which is also a minority owner 
of the ballclub), they far surpass even the Dallas Cowboys in total estimated 
value.[citation needed] On July 13, 2010, the morning of the 2010 Major 
League Baseball All-Star Game, George Steinbrenner died of a heart attack 
at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa, Florida.[43] His death came nine days 
after his 80th birthday, two days after the passing of long time Yankee 
Stadium public address announcer Bob Sheppard,[44] and eight days before 
that of former Yankee manager Ralph Houk. On July 14, the Yankees announced 
that players and coaches would wear a Steinbrenner commemorative patch 
on the left breast of their home and road uniforms, and a Bob Sheppard 
commemorative patch on the left arm.[45] The Steinbrenner family added 
a monument to Monument Park on September 20, 2010 to honor Steinbrenner.[46] 
He is buried at Trinity Memorial Gardens in Trinity, Florida. In addition 
to being an intense boss to his on-field employees, Steinbrenner was also 
known for pressuring and changing off-field employees (including various 
publicity directors), sometimes chewing them out in public. Longtime Cardinals 
announcer Jack Buck once said that he had seen Steinbrenner's yacht and 
that, "It was a beautiful thing to observe, with all 36 oars working in 
unison."[47] Former sportscaster Hank Greenwald, who called Yankee games 
on WABC radio for two years, once said he knew when Steinbrenner was in 
town by how tense the office staff was. Steinbrenner usually kept his complaints 
about the team broadcasters he approved of (except for the YES Network 
crew, who have generally not been his direct employees) out of the newspapers. 
However, he was known to be upset with the sometimes blunt commentary of 
former broadcaster Jim Kaat and former analyst Tony Kubek. The 1986 World 
Series was called "Steinbrenner's nightmare",[48] because it was a showdown 
between two of the Yankees' biggest rivals, their cross-town rival the 
New York Mets and their most hated rival, the Boston Red Sox. As a result, 
Steinbrenner wrote articles in the New York Post on the World Series.[49] 
The Mets won that World Series, which relieved many Yankee fans. Steinbrenner 
had a reputation as a domineering boss. Only three Yankee employees were 
continuously employed from the start of Steinbrenner's ownership in 1973 
until the end of his tenure.[clarification needed] One of those is long 
time Head Athletic Trainer Gene Monahan, who in 2010 missed his first spring 
training in 48 years after being diagnosed with cancer.[50] Harvey Greene, 
the Yankees' Director of Media Relations from 1986–1989, talked about the 
experience of working under Steinbrenner: George Steinbrenner was involved 
with thoroughbred horse racing from the early 1970s. He owned Kinsman Stud 
Farm in Ocala, Florida and raced under the name Kinsman Stable. Steinbrenner 
gave to many charitable causes. In 1982, George, "while attending the funeral 
of a police officer killed in the line of duty, was deeply moved by the 
ceremony in which the American flag was folded military-style and presented 
to the officer's surviving spouse and young children". "He was concerned 
about their education and who would help with the cost, so he established 
the Silver Shield Foundation," said Foundation's Co-Founder James E. Fuchs, 
a close friend of Mr. Steinbrenner's.[52] He often donated to the families 
of fallen police officers in the Tampa Police Department and the New York 
City Police Department in addition to college scholarships for many poor 
children.[13] During the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, Steinbrenner 
comforted United States Olympic Swimming medalist Ron Karnaugh through 
his father's death and maintained a relationship with him until his death.[53] 
At his residence in Tampa, Steinbrenner supported numerous individuals 
and charities including the Boys and Girls Club as well as the Salvation 
Army.[54] Mel Stottlemyre recalled that during his myeloma cancer treatment 
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital he had mentioned in passing to Steinbrenner 
how he regretted not being able to watch Yankee games from his room. Stottlemyre 
heard that Steinbrenner went all the way to Mayor Rudy Giuliani to ensure 
he was able to watch the broadcasts from his room.[55] Steinbrenner had 
also donated $1 million to St. Joseph's Children's Hospital where a wing 
was named in his honor.[56] Despite Steinbrenner's controversial status 
he poked fun at himself in the media. His frequent firings and rehirings 
of manager Billy Martin were lampooned in a '70s Miller Lite beer commercial 
in which Steinbrenner tells Martin "You're fired!" to which Martin replies 
"Oh, no, not again!" After one of Martin's real-life rehirings, the commercial 
was resurrected, only with Steinbrenner's line redubbed to say "You're 
hired!" The two commercials would sometimes alternate depending on Martin's 
status with the team. He hosted Saturday Night Live on October 20, 1990 
at the same time his former outfielder and Yankee manager, Lou Piniella, 
led the Cincinnati Reds to a World Championship. In the opening sketch, 
he dreamt of a Yankees team managed, coached, and entirely played by himself. 
In other sketches, he chews out the SNL "writing staff" (notably including 
Al Franken) for featuring him in a mock Slim Fast commercial with other 
ruthless leaders such as Saddam Hussein and Idi Amin and plays a folksy 
convenience store manager whose business ethic is virtually the complete 
opposite of that of the real Steinbrenner. In The Simpsons episode "Homer 
at the Bat", Mr. Burns fires Don Mattingly for refusing to shave sideburns 
only Burns could see. It is often assumed that this was a parody of an 
argument Steinbrenner and Mattingly had in real life with regards to Mattingly's 
hair length. However, the episode was actually recorded a year before the 
suspension occurred, and was nothing more than a coincidence.[57] As Mattingly 
walks off the baseball field, he states, "I still like him [Burns] better 
than Steinbrenner." He appeared as himself in the Albert Brooks comedy 
The Scout. In 1991, he played himself in an episode on YouTube of Good 
Sports, with Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal. In the 1994 computer game 
Superhero League of Hoboken, one of the schemes of the primary antagonist, 
Dr. Entropy, is to resurrect George Steinbrenner to bring chaos to the 
world and rule together. The superheroes foil his plan by resurrecting 
Billy Martin. After a public chastising of Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter 
for "partying too much", the two appeared in a Visa commercial club-hopping. 
A 2004 Visa commercial depicted Steinbrenner in the trainer's room at Yankee 
Stadium, suffering from an arm injury, unable to sign any checks, including 
that of his then-current manager Joe Torre, who spends most of the commercial 
treating Steinbrenner as if he were an important player. George Will once 
described Steinbrenner as an "error machine" and a "baseball dumb-o-meter".[58] 
Steinbrenner also was a fan of professional wrestling. He wrote the foreword 
of the 2005 Dusty Rhodes autobiography and was a regular at old Tampa Armory 
cards in the 1970s and 1980s. In March 1989, he appeared in the front row 
of the WWF's Saturday Night's Main Event broadcast, even interacting with 
manager Bobby "The Brain" Heenan at one point (Heenan remarked about the 
guy he managed in the ring at the time to Steinbrenner "I've got a ring 
full of Winfield"). At WWF WrestleMania 7, Steinbrenner, WWF owner Vince 
McMahon, and NFL announcer Paul Maguire filmed a skit with the trio debating 
instant replay. He was also present in the front row of an edition of WCW 
Monday Nitro in 1996, and in the front row of another edition as well early 
1998, when the event took place in Tampa. At the funeral of his long-time 
friend Otto Graham in December 2003, Steinbrenner fainted, leading to extensive 
media speculation that he was in ill health. New York Daily News cartoonist 
Bill Gallo often cited Steinbrenner's German heritage by drawing him in 
a Prussian military uniform, complete with spiked helmet, gold epaulettes 
and medals, calling him "General von Steingrabber". In ESPN's miniseries 
The Bronx is Burning, he is portrayed by Oliver Platt. George Steinbrenner 
appeared as a character in the situation comedy Seinfeld, when George Costanza 
worked for the Yankees for several seasons. Mitch Mitchell and Lee Bear 
portrayed the character, and Larry David provided voice-over performances 
whenever the character spoke. Steinbrenner's full face was never shown, 
and the character was always viewed from the back in scenes set in his 
office at Yankee Stadium. The character appeared in the following episodes: 
"The Opposite", "The Secretary", "The Race", "The Jimmy", "The Wink", "The 
Hot Tub", "The Caddy", "The Calzone", "The Bottle Deposit", "The Nap", 
"The Millennium", "The Muffin Tops", and "The Finale".[citation needed] 
The fictional Steinbrenner talked nonstop, regardless of whether anyone 
was listening, and sometimes referred to himself as "Big Stein". The team 
owner was known for eccentric decisions, such as cotton jerseys, threatening 
to move the team to New Jersey "just to upset people", scalping his owner's 
box tickets, wearing Lou Gehrig's uniform pants (and panicking about "that 
nerve disease" being contagious), trading several players to Frank Costanza's 
dismay, and canceling a meeting because he wanted George Costanza to get 
him an eggplant calzone. In "The Wink", the Steinbrenner character mentions 
all of the people he fired, saying Billy Martin four times, and mentions 
then-current manager Buck Showalter, but then quickly swears Costanza to 
silence. Though intended as a joke, the comment proved prophetic: A few 
weeks after the episode aired, Steinbrenner replaced Showalter as manager 
with Joe Torre.[citation needed] Steinbrenner's involvement with Seinfeld 
began when he refused a request to make a cameo appearance and permit a 
Yankees pennant to appear; the show nonetheless used the pennant. A year 
later, Steinbrenner was asked to permit a Yankees uniform to appear on 
the sixth-season "The Chaperone". The owner was still angry about the unauthorized 
pennant, and knew so little about the show that after reading the script 
he believed George Costanza had been named after him as an insult. He refused 
to permit the uniform's use unless the character was renamed. After watching 
the show and enjoying both it and the Costanza character, however, Steinbrenner 
approved the uniform,[59] and later maintained that he was a fan of the 
show and that "Costanza is always welcome back." He filmed three scenes 
for the Seinfeld season 7 finale, "The Invitations", but they were edited 
out when the time of the original episode ran longer than the allowed time. 
They are on the Seinfeld Season 7 DVD Disc 4.[citation needed] Jerry Seinfeld 
said after Steinbrenner's death: “Who else could be a memorable character
