Boxing on NBC is the de facto title for NBC Sports' boxing television coverage.[1] 
The earliest incarnation of NBC's boxing telecasts could be traced back 
to 1944. Although technically, an anthology program, the Cavalcade of Sports 
was best known for Friday night boxing (from Madison Square Garden) on 
NBC from 1944 through 1960, and (after NBC decided against featuring boxing 
due to sensitivity over criminal allegations in the sport) then for several 
more years on ABC. When Cavalcade of Sports closed up shop on June 24, 
1960 after a 14-year period, it marked the longest continuous run of any 
boxing program in television history. Another boxing program called Boxing 
from St. Nicholas Arena aired on NBC during the same period (more specifically, 
from 1946â€“1948) as the Cavalcade of Sports. In 2003, NBC entered a joint 
venture with Telemundo and boxing promotional group Main Events.[2] On 
three consecutive Saturday afternoons - May 3, 10 and 17 - NBC Sports and 
Telemundo provided live coverage from the same Main Events-promoted boxing 
event. It marked the first time that NBC broadcast professional boxing 
since 1992, when Sportsworld[3][4][5] ended its run after 14 years. The 
following year, NBC and Telemundo renewed their partnership with a series 
of five Saturday cards beginning April 17.[6] Beginning in 2006, when the 
NBC Sports Network was known as Versus, they began airing matches from 
Bob Arum's Top Rank group. Nick Charles was one of the announcers. In 2010, 
Versus broadcast the World Series of Boxing. NBC Sports Network's Fight 
Night series premiered on January 21, 2012 from 2300 Arena in Philadelphia 
with Kenny Rice and trainer Freddie Roach on the call and Chris Mannix 
of Sports Illustrated serving as reporter and researcher. In January 2015, 
NBC announced that Al Michaels would host ringside along with blow-by-blow 
man Marv Albert[7] and color commentator Sugar Ray Leonard for the PBC 
on NBC[8] Saturday night bouts. In partnership with Haymon Boxing,[9] NBC 
would televise 20 PBC on NBC events[10] (beginning on March 7[11]), including
