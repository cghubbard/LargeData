Revere is a city in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, United States, located 
approximately 5 miles (8.0 km) from downtown Boston. It is named after 
the American Revolutionary War patriot Paul Revere.[2] As of the 2010 United 
States Census, the city has a population of 51,755 inhabitants.[1] Revere 
borders the towns of Winthrop and Chelsea, and the Boston neighborhood 
of East Boston to the south, Everett and Malden to the west, Saugus and 
Lynn to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. According to the 
United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10 square miles 
(26 km2), of which, 5.9 square miles (15 km2) of it is land and 4.1 square 
miles (11 km2) of it (40.98%) is water. Revere’s first inhabitants were 
Native Americans who belonged to the Pawtucket tribe and were known as 
the Rumney Marsh Indians. The leader, or sachem, of the Pawtuckets was 
Nanepashemet of Lynn. In 1616, an epidemic, probably smallpox, swept the 
region, killing thousands in its wake. Nanepashemet retired to the Mystic 
River, in what is now Medford, but was found murdered in 1619 at his fort 
on the brow of Rock Hill overlooking the river. Three sons succeeded him 
in his reign. One of them, Wonohaquaham, also called Sagamore John, had 
jurisdiction over the Native Americans at Winnisemmit (later Chelsea) and 
Rumney Marsh. Often, the Native Americans, with their intimate knowledge 
of the vast, yet unexplored wilderness, would help the settlers in their 
struggle to survive. During King Philip's War, the local friendly Native 
Americans were placed on what is now Deer Island, where many of them perished. 
Some of them on the island were enlisted to help the colonists defeat the 
other warring tribes. Rumney Marsh was originally divided and allotted 
to twenty-one of Boston's most prominent citizens. By 1639, the original 
allotments had been consolidated into seven great farms. Farming was the 
principal industry of Winnisemmet, and Rumney Marsh in particular. On September 
25, 1634, Rumney Marsh was annexed to Boston, which had received its name 
only four years earlier. Winnisemmet and Pullen Poynt (which was later 
to be known as Winthrop) were also annexed to Boston. The first county 
road in North America stretched across Rumney Marsh from the Winnisemmet 
Ferry to Olde Salem in 1641. In 1739, Rumney Marsh, Winnisemmet and Pullen 
Poynt were set off from Boston and established as the town of Chelsea. 
The largest of the three settlements, Rumney Marsh (or North Chelsea) was 
selected as the Town Center. In 1775, the area played a role in the American 
Revolution as the site of the first naval battle, at Rumney Marsh, and 
other locations. In 1852, Pullen Poynt seceded from North Chelsea and was 
established as the town of Winthrop. That same year, Chelsea became its 
own city. In 1871, North Chelsea changed its name in honor of the great 
American patriot, Paul Revere, who died in 1818. On the morning of July 
28, 2014, an EF2 tornado touched down in nearby Chelsea and intensified 
as it entered the city of Revere, causing major damage to many buildings, 
including the Revere City Hall. Damaged cars, power outages, downed lines 
and downed trees were reported all around Revere, Chelsea, Winthrop and 
Boston.[3] It was the first tornado to hit Suffolk County since the National 
Weather Service began keeping records in 1950.[4] As of the 2010 United 
States Census,[16] there were 51,755 people residing in the city. The racial 
makeup of the city was 62.4% White, 4.9% Black, 5.6% Asian, 0.4% Native 
American, 0.025% Pacific Islander, 11.7% from other races, and 3.3% were 
multiracial. Hispanic or Latino persons were 24.4% of the population (5.8% 
Salvadoran, 4.9% Colombian, 3.7% Puerto Rican, 1.9% Mexican, 1.5% Guatemalan, 
1.3% Dominican). As of the same census, there were 47,283 people, 19,463 
households, and 11,872 families residing in the city. The population density 
was 7,994.2 people per square mile (3,089.0/km²). There were 20,181 housing 
units at an average density of 3,412.0/sq mi (1,318.4/km²). There were 
19,463 households out of which 25.5% had children under the age of 18 living 
with them, 41.8% were married couples living together, 13.9% had a female 
householder with no husband present, and 39% were non-families. 32.7% of 
all households were made up of individuals and 12.4% had someone living 
alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 
2.41 and the average family size was 3.09. The population was spread out 
with 21% under the age of 18, 7.9% from 18 to 24, 32.6% from 25 to 44, 
21.8% from 45 to 64, and 16.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median 
age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.6 males. For every 
100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.9 males. The median income for 
a household in the city was $37,067, and the median income for a family 
was $45,865. Males had a median income of $36,881 versus $31,300 for females. 
The per capita income for the city was $19,698. About 11.9% of families 
and 14.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.4% 
of those under age 18 and 10.4% of those age 65 or over. As of 2010, 27% 
of the residents of Revere were born outside of the United States. Many 
of them originate from North Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The 
2010 percentage of foreign born is twice that of 1990.[17] Revere Beach 
is the oldest public beach in the United States. It has a fairly active 
beach front district. From its inception, Revere Beach was "the people's 
beach", used mostly by the working class and the many immigrants who settled 
in the area. The Revere Beach Reservation Historic District was listed 
on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, including the full 
Revere Beach Reservation in 2003. The Beach began to deteriorate in the 
1950s and by the early 1970s it had become a strip of honky-tonk bars and 
abandoned buildings. The Great Blizzard of '78 proved to be the final death 
knell for the "old" Revere Beach, as many of the remaining businesses, 
amusements, pavilions, sidewalks, and much of the seawall were destroyed. 
The area once boasted an extensive array of amusement rides and attractions. 
The Whip, the Ferris wheel, Bluebeard's Palace, the Fun House, Hurley's 
Dodgems, the Pit, Himalaya, Hippodrome, Sandy's, the Wild Mouse, the Virginia 
Reel and many more provided hours of enjoyment for residents and visitors 
alike. The biggest attraction was the Cyclone, among the largest roller 
coasters in the United States. Built in 1925, its cars traveled at speeds 
of up to 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) and its height reached 100 feet (30 m).[18] 
Also notable was the Derby Racer racing roller coaster, which had a series 
of accidents that killed or critically injured riders between 1911 and 
1936. Lightning was another roller coaster at Revere Beach, and was a member 
of Harry Traver's infamous "Terrifying Triplets". In addition, there were 
two roller skating rinks, two bowling alleys, and numerous food stands. 
There were also ballrooms, including the most famous, the Oceanview and 
the Beachview, each the site of many dance marathons which were popular 
in the 1930s. The Beach was the focus of a major revitalization effort 
by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation and the 
City in the 1980s and was officially reopened in May 1992. It now boasts 
high-rise housing units, a re-sanded beach, restored pavilions, and a renovated 
boulevard. Revere commemorated the centennial of the first opening of Revere 
Beach on the weekend of July 19, 1996. Revere has eight places on the National 
Register of Historic Places. Church of Christ Immaculate Conception Rectory

Ground Winthrop Parkway Kelly's Roast Beef is a fast food eatery founded 
in Revere in 1951. Its main location is along the Revere Beach shoreline. 
Kelly's claims to have invented the modern roast beef sandwich, saying 
it was unknown as such before they introduced it in 1951.[19][20] Considered 
the oldest continuously operating candy company in the United States, Necco 
is best known for its namesake candy, Necco Wafers, its seasonal Sweethearts 
Conversation Hearts, and brands such as the Clark Bar and Haviland Thin 
Mints. The company maintains its headquarters at 135 American Legion Highway 
in Revere, where it offers tours of the facilities. Wonderland Greyhound 
Park was a greyhound racing track located in the city owned by the Westwood 
Group. It was constructed on the site of the former Wonderland Amusement 
Park. Wonderland opened on June 12, 1935 and formerly offered 361 performances 
during its 100-day, April to September racing period. Parimutuel wagering 
was legalized by the Massachusetts Legislature in 1934. The Park opened 
the following year and offered greyhound racing from June 1935 until September 
2009. It ran its last program on September 18, 2009, as a result of a statewide 
referendum that banned greyhound racing. The future of the land is uncertain. 
From 1934 to 1943 murals were produced in the United States through the 
Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, 
of the Treasury Department. The intended purpose of the murals was to boost 
the morale of the American people from the effects of the Depression. Competitions 
that determined commissioned works were open to all artists in the United 
States.[21] division. Muralist Ross Moffett painted the mural "The First 
Store and Tavern" in 1939 at the U.S. Post Office, in Revere.[22] The completion 
in 1838 of the Eastern Railroad (later the Boston & Maine), and in 1875 
of the Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn Railroad, signaled the beginning of 
rapid population growth for the town and the development of the beach as 
a summer resort. By 1885, ten years later, the town had increased to 3,637 
inhabitants, more than tripling in size over 15 years. By 1890, the population 
had grown to 5,668. In 1871, Revere was the site of The Great Revere Train 
Wreck of 1871, the deadliest railroad incident in Massachusetts history, 
when the Eastern Railroad's "Portland Express" slammed into the back of 
a stopped local commuter train at Revere Station. The MBTA Blue Line terminates 
in Revere, with stops at Wonderland, Revere Beach, and Beachmont. U.S. 
Route 1 and state highways 1A, 16, 60, 107, and 145 run through Revere. 
Revere Public Schools operates the city's public schools. High school students 
can attend either the Revere High School, Northeast Metropolitan Regional 
Vocational High School or the Seacoast School. Some students attend local 
charter schools in other cities such as the Pioneer Charter School of Science. 
There are three public middle schools. They are, The Garfield School, Susan 
B. Anthony Middle School, and the Rumney Marsh Academy. Private PK-8 schools 
include both Eagle Heights Academy and Immaculate Conception.[23] See also
