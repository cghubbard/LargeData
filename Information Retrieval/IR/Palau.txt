(i/pəˈlaʊ/, historically Belau or Pelew), officially the Republic of Palau 
(Palauan: Beluu er a Belau),[4] is an island country with a population 
of 17,948 on 465 km2, located in the western Pacific Ocean. It contains 
approximately 250 islands, which form the western chain of the Caroline 
Islands in Micronesia. The most populous of these is Koror. The capital 
Ngerulmud is located on the nearby island of Babeldaob, in Melekeok State. 
Palau shares maritime boundaries with Indonesia, the Philippines, and the 
Federated States of Micronesia. The country was originally settled approximately 
3,000 years ago by migrants from the Philippines and sustained a Negrito 
population until around 900 years ago. The islands were first explored 
by Europeans in the 16th century, and were made part of the Spanish East 
Indies in 1574. Following Spain's defeat in the Spanish–American War in 
1898, the islands were sold to Imperial Germany in 1899 under the terms 
of the German–Spanish Treaty, where they were administered as part of German 
New Guinea. The Imperial Japanese Navy conquered Palau during World War 
I, and the islands were later made a part of the Japanese-ruled South Pacific 
Mandate by the League of Nations. During World War II, skirmishes, including 
the major Battle of Peleliu, were fought between American and Japanese 
troops as part of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. Along with other 
Pacific Islands, Palau was made a part of the United States-governed Trust 
Territory of the Pacific Islands in 1947. Having voted against joining 
the Federated States of Micronesia in 1979, the islands gained full sovereignty 
in 1994 under a Compact of Free Association with the United States. Politically, 
Palau is a presidential republic in free association with the United States, 
which provides defense, funding, and access to social services. Legislative 
power is concentrated in the bicameral Palau National Congress. Palau's 
economy is based mainly on tourism, subsistence agriculture and fishing, 
with a significant portion of gross national product (GNP) derived from 
foreign aid. The country uses the United States dollar as its currency. 
The islands' culture mixes Japanese, Micronesian and Melanesian elements. 
The majority of citizens are of mixed Micronesian, Melanesian, and Austronesian 
descent, with significant groups descended from Japanese and Filipino settlers. 
The country's two official languages are Palauan (member of the wider Sunda–Sulawesi 
language group) and English, with Japanese, Sonsorolese, and Tobian recognised 
as regional languages. The name for the islands in the Palauan language, 
Belau, likely derives from either the Palauan word for "village", beluu,[5] 
or from aibebelau ("indirect replies"), relating to a creation myth.[6] 
The name "Palau" entered the English language from the Spanish Los Palaos, 
via the German Palau. An archaic name for the islands in English was the 
"Pelew Islands".[7] It should not be confused with Pulau, which is an Indonesian 
word meaning "island". Palau was originally settled between the 3rd and 
2nd millennia BC, most likely from the Philippines or Indonesia.[8] The 
islands sustained a population of short-statured Negrito or Pygmy people 
until the 12th century, when they were replaced.[citation needed] The modern 
population, judging by its language, may have come from the Sunda Islands. 
Sonsorol, part of the Southwest Islands, an island chain approximately 
600 kilometres (370 mi) from the main island chain of Palau, was sighted 
by Europeans as early as 1522, when the Spanish mission of the Trinidad, 
the flagship of Ferdinand Magellan's voyage of circumnavigation, sighted 
two small islands around the 5th parallel north, naming them "San Juan".[9] 
After the conquest of the Philippines in 1565 by the Spanish Empire, the 
archipelago of Palau became part of the territory of the Captaincy General 
of the Philippines, established in 1574 as part of the Spanish East Indies 
with the capital based in the colonial centre in Manila. However, the Spanish 
presence only began to express with evangelization, began at the end of 
17th century, and its dominance began to take shape in the 18th century. 
The conscious discovery of Palau came a century later in 1697, when a group 
of Palauans were shipwrecked on the Philippine island of Samar to the northwest. 
They were interviewed by the Czech missionary Paul Klein on 28 December 
1696. Klein was able to draw the first map of Palau based on the Palauans' 
representation of their home islands that they made with an arrangement 
of 87 pebbles on the beach. Klein reported his findings to the Jesuit Superior 
General in a letter sent in June 1697.[10] This map and the letter caused 
a vast interest in the new islands. Another letter written by Fr. Andrew 
Serrano was sent to Europe in 1705, essentially copying the information 
given by Klein. The letters resulted in three unsuccessful Jesuit attempts 
to travel to Palau from Spanish Philippines in 1700, 1708 and 1709. The 
islands were first visited by the Jesuit expedition led by Francisco Padilla 
on 30 November 1710. The expedition ended with the stranding of the two 
priests, Jacques Du Beron and Joseph Cortyl, on the coast of Sonsorol, 
because the mother ship Santísima Trinidad was driven to Mindanao by a 
storm. Another ship was sent from Guam in 1711 to save them only to capsize, 
causing the death of three more Jesuit priests. The failure of these missions 
gave Palau the original Spanish name Islas Encantadas (Enchanted Islands).[11] 
Despite these early misfortunes, the Spanish Empire later came to dominate 
the islands.[citation needed] British traders became prominent visitors 
to Palau in the 18th century, followed by expanding Spanish influence in 
the 19th century. Following its defeat in the Spanish–American War, Spain 
sold Palau and most of the rest of the Caroline Islands to the German Empire 
in 1899 pursuant to the German–Spanish Treaty (1899). During World War 
I, the Japanese Empire annexed the islands after seizing them from Germany 
in 1914. Following World War I, the League of Nations formally placed the 
islands under Japanese administration as part of the South Pacific Mandate. 
During World War II, the United States captured Palau from Japan in 1944 
after the costly Battle of Peleliu, when more than 2,000 Americans and 
10,000 Japanese were killed. The islands passed formally to the United 
States under United Nations auspices in 1947 as part of the Trust Territory 
of the Pacific Islands established pursuant to Security Council Resolution 
21. Four of the Trust Territory districts joined together and formed the 
Federated States of Micronesia in 1979, but the districts of Palau and 
the Marshall Islands declined to participate. Palau, the westernmost cluster 
of the Carolines, instead opted for independent status in 1978. It approved 
a new constitution and became the Republic of Palau in 1981.[12] It signed 
a Compact of Free Association with the United States in 1982. After eight 
referenda and an amendment to the Palauan constitution, the Compact was 
ratified in 1993. The Compact went into effect on 1 October 1994,[13] marking 
Palau de jure independent, although it had been de facto independent since 
25 May 1994, when the trusteeship ended. Legislation making Palau an "offshore" 
financial center was passed by the Senate in 1998. In 2001, Palau passed 
its first bank regulation and anti-money laundering laws. Palau is a multi-party 
democratic republic. The President of Palau is both head of state and head 
of government. Executive power is exercised by the government, while legislative 
power is vested in both the government and the Palau National Congress. 
The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Palau 
adopted a constitution in 1981. The governments of the United States and 
Palau concluded a Compact of Free Association in 1986, similar to compacts 
that the United States had entered into with the Federated States of Micronesia 
and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.[14] The compact entered into 
force on 1 October 1994, concluding Palau's transition from trusteeship 
to independence[14] as the last portion of the Trust Territory of the Pacific 
Islands to secure its independence pursuant to Security Council Resolution 
956. The Compact of Free Association between the United States and Palau[15] 
sets forth the free and voluntary association of their governments. It 
primarily focuses on the issues of government, economic, security and defense 
relations.[16] Palau has no independent military, relying on the United 
States for its defense. Under the compact, the American military was granted 
access to the islands for 50 years. The U.S. Navy role is minimal, limited 
to a handful of Navy Seabees (construction engineers). The U.S. Coast Guard 
patrols in national waters. As a sovereign nation, Palau conducts its own 
foreign relations.[14] Since independence, Palau has established diplomatic 
relations with a number of nations, including many of its Pacific neighbors. 
On 29 November 1994, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 
963 recommending Palau's admission to the United Nations. The United Nations 
General Assembly approved admission for Palau pursuant to Resolution 49/63 
on 15 December 1994.[17] Palau has since joined several other international 
organizations. In September 2006, Palau hosted the first Taiwan-Pacific 
Allies Summit. Its President has made official visits to other Pacific 
countries, including Taiwan. The United States maintains a diplomatic delegation 
and an embassy in Palau, but most aspects of the countries' relationship 
have to do with Compact-funded projects, which are the responsibility of 
the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Insular Affairs.[18] In 
international politics, Palau often votes with the United States with respect 
to United Nations General Assembly resolutions.[19] Palau is a member of 
the Nauru Agreement.[20] In 1981, Palau voted for the world's first nuclear-free 
constitution. This constitution banned the use, storage and disposal of 
nuclear, toxic chemical, gas and biological weapons without first being 
approved by a ¾ majority in a referendum.[21] This ban delayed Palau's 
transition to independence, because while negotiating the Compact, the 
U.S. insisted on the option to operate nuclear propelled vessels and store 
nuclear weapons within the territory,[22] prompting campaigns for independence 
and denuclearisation.[23] After several referendums that failed to achieve 
a ¾ majority, the people of Palau finally approved the Compact in 1994.[24][25] 
In June 2009, Palau announced that it would accept up to seventeen Uyghurs 
that had previously been detained by the American military at Guantanamo 
Bay,[26] with some American compensation for the cost of their upkeep.[27] 
Only one of the Uyghurs initially agreed to resettlement,[28] but by the 
end of October, six of the seventeen had been transferred to Palau.[29] 
An aid agreement with the United States, finalized in January 2010, was 
reported to be unrelated to the Uyghur agreement.[30] Palau is divided 
into sixteen states (until 1984 called municipalities). These are listed 
below with their areas (in square kilometers) and 2012 Census populations: 
Historically, Palau's Rock Islands have been part of the State of Koror. 
Palau employs 18 marine police officers to patrol the nation's 230,000 
square mile exclusive economic zone. They employ a donated Australian patrol 
boat, the Remeliik, to hunt for poachers and unlicensed fishermen. Two 
small fiberglass boats are used for littoral operations. They are based 
on Koror.[31] Palau's territory consists of an archipelago located in the 
Pacific Ocean. Its most populous islands are Angaur, Babeldaob, Koror and 
Peleliu. The latter three lie together within the same barrier reef, while 
Angaur is an oceanic island several miles to the south. About two-thirds 
of the population live on Koror. The coral atoll of Kayangel is north of 
these islands, while the uninhabited Rock Islands (about 200) are west 
of the main island group. A remote group of six islands, known as the Southwest 
Islands, some 375 miles (604 km) from the main islands, make up the states 
of Hatohobei and Sonsorol. Palau has a tropical climate with an annual 
mean temperature of 28 °C (82 °F). Rainfall is heavy throughout the year, 
averaging 3,800 mm (150 in). The average humidity is 82% and, although 
rain falls more frequently between July and October, there is still much 
sunshine. Typhoons are rare, as Palau lies outside the main typhoon zone. 
The strongest typhoon that struck Palau since reliable records was Typhoon 
Haiyan in 2013.[32] A mandatory emergency evacuation was issued for Kayangel. 
A storm surge damaged several houses. Despite residents' refusal to evacuate 
safely, no fatalities or major injuries were reported. While much of Palau 
remains free of environmental degradation, areas of concern include illegal 
dynamite fishing, inadequate solid waste disposal facilities in Koror and 
extensive sand and coral dredging in the Palau lagoon. As with other Pacific 
island nations, rising sea level presents a major environmental threat. 
Inundation of low-lying areas threatens coastal vegetation, agriculture, 
and an already insufficient water supply. Wastewater treatment is a problem, 
along with the handling of toxic waste from fertilizers and biocides. Saltwater 
crocodiles are also indigenous to Palau and occur in varying numbers throughout 
the various mangroves and even in parts of the beautiful rock islands. 
Although this species is generally considered extremely dangerous, there 
has only been one fatal human attack in Palau within modern history, and 
that was in the 1960s. In Palau, the largest crocodile measured in at 4.5 
metres (15 ft).[citation needed] The nation is also vulnerable to earthquakes, 
volcanic activity, and tropical storms. Palau already has a problem with 
inadequate water supply and limited agricultural areas to support its population. 
On 5 November 2005, President Tommy E. Remengesau, Jr. took the lead on 
a regional environmental initiative called the Micronesia challenge, which 
would conserve 30% of near-shore coastal waters and 20% of forest land 
by 2020. Following Palau, the initiative was joined by the Federated States 
of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and the U.S. territories of Guam and 
Northern Mariana Islands. Together, this combined region represents nearly 
5% of the marine area of the Pacific Ocean and 7% of its coastline. On 
25 September 2009, Palau announced that it would create the world's first 
shark sanctuary.[34] Palau banned all commercial shark fishing within the 
waters of its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The sanctuary protects about 
600,000 square kilometres (230,000 sq mi) of ocean,[35] a similar size 
to France.[36][37][38] President Johnson Toribiong announced the sanctuary 
at a meeting of the United Nations.[36][39][40] President Toribiong proposed 
a worldwide ban on fishing for sharks.[36] In 2012, Palau received the 
Future Policy Award from World Future Council, because "Palau is a global 
leader in protecting marine ecosystems".[41] Palau's economy consists primarily 
of tourism, subsistence agriculture and fishing. Tourist activity focuses 
on scuba diving and snorkeling in the islands' rich marine environment, 
including its barrier reefs' walls and World War II wrecks. The government 
is the largest employer, relying heavily on U.S. financial assistance. 
Business and tourist arrivals numbered some 50,000 in financial year 2000/2001. 
The population enjoys a per capita income twice that of Micronesia as a 
whole. Long-term prospects for the key tourist sector have been greatly 
bolstered by the expansion of air travel in the Pacific, the rising prosperity 
of leading East Asian countries and the willingness of foreigners to finance 
infrastructure development. Air service has at times been spotty. Palau 
Micronesia Air, Asian Spirit and Pacific Flier provided service to the 
Philippines and other destinations at various times during the 2000s, but 
all suspended service.[42] United Airlines now provides near-daily service 
to and from Guam, and once-weekly service to Yap. Also, Delta Air Lines 
provides service three times per week to Tokyo. In November 2006, Palau 
Saving Bank officially announced bankruptcy. On 13 December of the same 
year, the Palau Horizon reported that 641 depositors had been affected. 
Among them, 398 held less than $5,000 USD, with the remainder ranging from 
$5,000 to $2 million USD. On 12 December 79 affected people received compensation. 
Mr. Toribiong said, "The fund for the payout came from the balance of Palau 
government's loan from Taiwan." From a total of $1 million USD, which originally 
was for assisting Palau's development, $955,000 USD was left at the time 
of bankruptcy. Toribiong requested the Taiwanese government use the balance 
to repay its loans. Taiwan agreed to the request. The compensation would 
include those who held less than $4,000 USD in an account.[43] The income 
tax has three brackets with progressive rates of 9.3%, 15%, and 19.6% respectively. 
Corporate tax is 4%, and general sales tax is 0.0%. There are no property 
taxes. Palau International Airport provides scheduled direct flights with 
Guam, Manila, Seoul and Taipei and since December 2010, Tokyo-Narita. In 
addition, the states of Angaur and Peleliu have regular service to international 
destinations. Freight, military and cruise ships often call at Malakal 
Harbor, on Malakal Island outside Koror. The country has no railways, and 
of the 61 km or 38 mi of highways, only 36 km or 22 mi are paved. Driving 
is on the right and the speed limit is 40 km/h (25 mph). Taxis are available 
in Koror. They are not metered and fares are negotiable. Only Koror offers 
bus service. Transportation between islands mostly relies on private boats 
and domestic air services. However, there are some state run boats between 
islands as a cheaper alternative. The population of Palau is approximately 
21,000, of whom 70% are native Palauans of mixed Melanesian, and Austronesian 
descent. There are many Asian communities within Palau. Filipinos form 
the largest Asian group and second largest ethnic group in the country. 
There are significant numbers of Chinese and Koreans. There are also smaller 
numbers of Palauans of mixed or full Japanese ancestry. Smaller numbers 
of Bangladeshi and Nepalese migrant workers and their descendants who came 
to the islands during the late 1900s can also be found. Most Palauans of 
Asian origin came during the late 1900s with many Filipinos, Chinese, Bangladeshis 
and Nepalese coming to Palau as unskilled workers and professionals.[44] 
There are also small numbers of Europeans and Americans. The official languages 
of Palau are Palauan and English, except for two states (Sonsorol and Hatohobei) 
where the local language, Sonsorolese and Tobian, respectively, along with 
Palauan, is official. Japanese is spoken by some older Palauans and is 
an official language in the State of Angaur.[45][46] Including second-language 
speakers, more people speak English than Palauan in Palau [1]. The German 
and Japanese occupations of Palau both subsidized missionaries to follow 
the Spanish. Three quarters of the population are Christians (mainly Roman 
Catholics and Protestants), while Modekngei (a combination of Christianity, 
traditional Palauan religion and fortune telling) and the ancient Palauan 
religion are commonly observed. Japanese rule brought Mahayana Buddhism 
and Shinto to Palau, which were the majority religions among Japanese settlers. 
However, following Japan's World War II defeat, the remaining Japanese 
largely converted to Christianity, while the remainder continued to observe 
Buddhism, but stopped practicing Shinto rites.[47] There are also approximately 
400 Bengali Muslims in Palau, and recently a few Uyghurs detained in Guantanamo 
Bay were allowed to settle in the island nation. According to the 2005 
census[48] 49.4% of the population is Roman Catholic, 21.3% Protestant, 
8.7% Modekngei and 5.3% Seventh-day Adventist. Only 1% of the population 
was estimated to be Buddhist in 2010, with the Chinese community also practicing 
Chinese folk religion as well.[49] In 2009, the small Jewish community 
sent two cyclists to the 18th Maccabiah Games.[50] Palauan society follows 
a very strict matrilineal system. Matrilineal practices are seen in nearly 
every aspect of Palauan traditions, especially in funeral, marriage, inheritance 
and the passing of traditional titles. The cuisine includes local foods 
such as cassava, taro, yam, potato, fish and pork. Western cuisine is favored 
among young Palauans and the locals are joined by foreign tourists. The 
rest of Micronesia is similar with much less tourism, leading to fewer 
restaurants. Tourists eat mainly at their hotels on such islands. Some 
local foods include an alcoholic drink made from coconut on the tree; the 
drink made from the roots of the kava; and the chewing of betel nuts. The 
traditional government system still influences the nation's affairs, leading 
the federal government to repeatedly attempt to limit its power. Many of 
these attempts took the form of amendments to the constitution that were 
supported by the corporate sector to protect what they deemed should be 
free economic zones. One such example occurred in early 2010, where the 
Idid clan, the ruling clan of the Southern Federation, under the leadership 
of Bilung, the Southern Federation's queen, raised a civil suit against 
the Koror State Public Lands Authority (KSPLA). The Idid clan laid claim 
over Malakal Island, a major economic zone and Palau's most important port, 
citing documents from the German Era. The verdict held that the Island 
belonged to the KSPLA. The present day "traditional" government of Palau 
is a continuation of its ancestor, composed of practices that span thousands 
of years.[citation needed] Traditionally, Palau was hierarchically organized. 
The lowest level is the village or hamlet, then the chiefdom (now politically 
referred to as a state) and finally alliances of chiefdoms. In ancient 
times, numerous federations divided power, but upon the 17th century introduction 
of firearms by the British, an imbalance of power occurred. Palau became 
divided into northern and southern federations. The Northern Federation 
is headed by the high chief and chiefess of the ruling clan Uudes of Melekeok 
state, the Reklai and Ebilreklai. They are commonly referred to as the 
king and queen of the Northern Federation. This northern federation comprises 
the state of Kayangel, Ngerchelong, Ngardmau, Ngiwal, Ngaraard, Ngatpang, 
Ngeremlengui, Melekok, Aimeliik, Ngchesar and Airai. The Southern Federation 
is likewise represented by the high chief and chiefess of the ruling Idid 
of Koror state. The Southern Federation comprises the states of Koror, 
Peleliu and Angaur. However, fewer and fewer Palauans have knowledge of 
the concept of federations, and the term is slowly dying out. Federations 
were established as a way of safeguarding states and hamlets who shared 
economic, social, and political interests, but with the advent a federal 
government, safeguards are less meaningful. It is interesting to note however, 
that in international relations, the king of Palau is synonymous with the 
Ibedul of Koror. This is because Koror is the industrial capital of the 
nation, elevating his position over the Reklai of Melekeok. It is a misconception 
that the king and queen of Palau, or any chief and his female counterpart 
for that matter are married. Traditional leaders and their female counterparts 
have always been related and unmarried (marrying relatives was a traditional 
taboo). Usually, a chief and his female counterpart are brother and sister, 
or close cousins, and have their own spouses. Baseball is a popular sport 
in Palau after its introduction by the Japanese in the 1920s. The Palau 
national baseball team won the gold medal at the 1990, 1998 and 2010 Micronesian 
Games, as well as at the 2007 Pacific Games. Palau also has a national 
football team, organised by the Palau Soccer Association, but is not a 
member of FIFA. The Association also organizes the Palau Soccer League. 
Primary education is required until age of 16. Schools include both public 
and private institutions as well as some fields of study available at Palau 
Community College. For further undergraduate, graduate and professional 
programs, students travel abroad to attend tertiary institutions. Popular 
choices among Palauan scholars include the San Diego State University, 
University of the South Pacific, University of Guam, and the University 
of Hawaii.[51] Palau has its own cuisine, for instance, a dessert called 
tama Palauan cuisine includes local foods such as cassava, taro, yam, potato, 
fish and pork. Western cuisine is favored among young Palauans. Several 
television programs and films have been shot in Palau. Examples include 
the reality show Survivor: Palau and the 1968 film Hell in the Pacific 
starring Lee Marvin.[52] A television documentary about Palau called Strategic 
Trust: The Making of Nuclear-free Palau was narrated by Joanne Woodward
