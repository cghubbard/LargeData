Taiwan Series (Chinese: 台灣大賽) is the championship series of the Chinese 
Professional Baseball League. It is usually played in October, after the 
regular season. It was formerly known as the CPBL Seasonal Championship 
Series (Chinese: 中華職棒年度總冠軍賽), and was renamed the Taiwan Series after the 
merger of the Chinese Professional Baseball League and the Taiwan Major 
League in 2003. Starting in 2005, the winner of the Taiwan Series competes 
in the Asia Series. Teams play two fifty-game half seasons. The two half-season 
winners are automatically the number one and two seeds; the one with the 
better full-season record gains an automatic berth into the best-of-seven 
Taiwan Series, played in a 2-3-2 format. The other team must play a best-of-five 
series against the team with the best full-season record but didn't win 
either half-season. If the same team wins both halves, the next two teams 
with the best full-season record play in the first round; the winner plays 
in the Taiwan Series, with the team that wins both halves having a 2-2-3
