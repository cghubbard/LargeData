Michael Devereaux (born April 10, 1963) is a former Major League Baseball 
outfielder. He was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the fifth round 
of the 1985 amateur draft and made his debut on September 2, 1987. Along 
with the Dodgers, Devereaux played for the Baltimore Orioles in two separate 
stints, and the Chicago White Sox, Atlanta Braves and Texas Rangers. Devereaux 
was born in Casper, Wyoming. He went to Kelly Walsh High School in Casper.[1] 
He played collegiately at Mesa Community College and Arizona State University 
where he earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Finance.[2] The peak of Devereaux's 
career was from 1989 to 1993, with his best season coming in 1992 with 
the Orioles, when he played in 159 games, with 24 home runs, 107 RBIs and 
a .276 batting average. Devereaux won the 1995 NLCS MVP award with the 
Atlanta Braves by driving in the game-winning RBI in the 10th inning of 
Game One and hitting a three run home run in Game Four against Cincinnati. 
The Braves went on to defeat the Cleveland Indians in the World Series.

the California Angels.[3] The call was controversial, as the home run ball

the call with umpire Ken Kaiser the following day and was ejected prior 
to the start of the next game.[4] Devereaux played his final MLB game with 
his original team, the Dodgers, on April 17, 1998. In 12 seasons, he had
