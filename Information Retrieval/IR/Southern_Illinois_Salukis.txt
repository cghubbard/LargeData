The Southern Illinois Salukis are the varsity athletic teams representing 
Southern Illinois University Carbondale. The nickname comes from the Saluki, 
the Royal Dog of Egypt and the Persian greyhound, which ties into the fact 
that southern Illinois has had the nickname "Little Egypt" for just under 
200 years. The Salukis play their home basketball games at SIU Arena and 
football games at Saluki Stadium. Southern Illinois University was a member 
of the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference from 1913 to 1962.

Subdivision Missouri Valley Football Conference. SIU's sports mascot is 
the Saluki. A Saluki is one of the oldest dog breeds, and is an Egyptian 
hunting dog similar to a greyhound or whippet.[2] SIU's teams originally 
competed under the team name "Maroons" from 1913 to 1951.[2] Then the Saluki 
was chosen as SIU's mascot on March 19, 1951 in part because the southern 
Illinois region is colloquially known as Little Egypt.[2] A member of the
