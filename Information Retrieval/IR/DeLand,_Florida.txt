DeLand is a city in the U.S. state of Florida. It is the county seat of 
Volusia County. The city sits approximately 34 miles (55 km) north of the 
central business district of Orlando, and approximately 23 miles (37 km) 
west of the central business district of Daytona Beach. As of the 2010 
U.S. Census, the city had a population of 27,031. It is a part of the Deltona–Daytona 
Beach–Ormond Beach, FL metropolitan statistical area, which was home to 
590,289 people as of the 2010 census. The city was founded in 1876, and 
was named for its founder, Henry Addison DeLand.[5] DeLand is home to Stetson 
University, Florida's oldest private college, as well as the Museum of 
Art - DeLand. The DeLand Municipal Airport serves as an uncontrolled general 
aviation reliever airport to commercial operations at Daytona Beach International 
Airport (DAB), Orlando Sanford International Airport (SFB) and Orlando 
International Airport (MCO). On February 2, 2007, DeLand and the surrounding 
area was the site of a major tornado outbreak.[6] Known as Persimmon Hollow 
for the wild persimmon trees that grow around the natural springs, the 
area was originally accessible only by steamboat up the St. Johns River. 
It was settled in 1874 by Captain John Rich, who built a log cabin. Henry 
Addison DeLand, a baking soda magnate from Fairport, New York, visited 
there in 1876, and envisioned building a citrus, agricultural and tourism 
center. That year he bought land and founded the town, naming it after 
himself. He sold his northern business and hired people to clear land, 
lay out streets, erect buildings and recruit settlers, most of whom came 
from upstate New York (however, he never lived in the city year-round.) 
The City of DeLand was officially incorporated in 1882, and became the 
county seat of Volusia County in 1887. It was the first city in Florida 
to have electricity.[citation needed] In 1877 Henry A. DeLand built a public 
school for the town.[5] To enhance the community's stature and culture, 
and to enhance the value of his local real estate holdings, in 1883 Henry 
A. DeLand established DeLand Academy, Florida's first private college.[5] 
However, in 1885, a freeze destroyed the orange crop. One story has it 
that DeLand had guaranteed settlers' investments as an inducement to relocate, 
and so was obligated to buy back their ruined groves, though there is no 
hard evidence that this actually happened. Like many other would-be real 
estate magnates in the area at the time, his Florida investments were nearly 
worthless after the freeze, and he returned to his home in the North. DeLand 
entrusted the academy to his friend John B. Stetson, a wealthy hat manufacturer 
from Philadelphia and one of the institution's founding trustees. In 1889, 
it was renamed John B. Stetson University in its patron's honor.[5] In 
1900 it founded the first law school in Florida (relocated to Gulfport 
in 1954). Its various sports teams are called the Hatters. During the 1920s 
Florida Land Boom, DeLand's streets filled with fine examples of stucco 
Mediterranean Revival architecture by native architect Medwin Peek and 
others, many of which have been handsomely restored, one being the recently 
reopened Athens Theatre. Since 1992, the city has hosted the DeLand Fall 
Festival of the Arts, a two-day event in the historic downtown area. As 
of 2009, the event has an annual attendance of more than 50,000 over the 
weekend immediately prior to Thanksgiving each year. DeLand is located 
at 29°1′44″N 81°18′2″W﻿ / ﻿29.02889°N 81.30056°W﻿ / 29.02889; -81.30056,[1] 
approximately halfway between Orlando and Daytona Beach. According to the 
United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 17.8 square miles 
(46.1 km2), of which 17.6 square miles (45.6 km2) is land and 0.19 square 
miles (0.5 km2), or 1.06%, is water.[7] DeLand is drained by the St. Johns 
River. As of the census[4] of 2013, there were 28,237 people, 9,950 households, 
and 4,631 families residing in the city. The population density was 1317.1/mi²

of the population were below the poverty line, including 31.3% of those 
under age 18 and 8.7% of those age 65 or over. Downtown DeLand's main street, 
Woodland Boulevard, has a number of notable 19th-century buildings. It 
is officially known as Downtown DeLand Historic District. The Garden District 
is a mixed-use neighborhood adjacent to downtown DeLand, which is officially 
known as Downtown DeLand's Historic Garden District. The neighborhood was 
originally developed between 1900 and 1920. It fell into a long period 
of decline after World War II, and by the 1980s had become blighted.[10] 
In 2001, Michael E. Arth, a California artist, urban designer and filmmaker, 
bought twenty-seven dilapidated structures, renamed the area the Garden 
District, and lobbied to create a new historic district. During the following 
eight years he restored or rebuilt 32 homes and businesses, which have 
become the core of a neighborhood revival. A feature-length documentary 
film, New Urban Cowboy: Toward a New Pedestrianism, tells the story of 
DeLand and the Garden District.[11] The film premiered in DeLand in January 
2009 at the newly restored Athens Theatre. Previously, the film had appeared 
in seven film festivals and received the Audience Choice Award at the Real 
to Reel International Film Festival in 2008. Public primary and secondary 
education is handled by Volusia County Schools. DeLand hosts all home games 
for Stetson University Hatters athletic teams. The men's and women's basketball 
teams play at the J. Ollie Edmunds Center, an on-campus arena which opened 
in 1974 and seats approximately 5,000 spectators. The Hatters baseball 
team plays at Melching Field at Conrad Park, a 2,500-seat ballpark located 
off campus just south of downtown DeLand. Melching Field was built in 1999 
and is recognized as one of the finer college baseball venues in the NCAA, 
having hosted numerous Atlantic Sun Conference championships and other 
baseball related tournaments and events. Prior to the opening of Melching 
Field, the Hatters played at old Conrad Park on the same site, which also 
hosted spring training games in the 1940s and 1950s and the DeLand Red 
Hats, a Florida State League minor league franchise. Adjacent to Melching 
Field is Spec Martin Stadium, a 6,000-seat football stadium. Spec Martin 
Stadium hosts DeLand High School Bulldog football and soccer games, and 
serves as home of the Stetson University Hatters football team. Stetson 
had discontinued its football program in the early 1960s, but reinstated 
the sport in 2013, when it joined the Pioneer Football League. As part 
of Stetson's re-entry into college football, Spec Martin Stadium underwent 
significant renovations, including a new press box, handicapped and premium 
seating areas, and new locker room facilities. DeLand has been called the 
"skydiving capital of the world", with the majority of skydiving industries 
calling it home.[12] The skydiving industry employs over 500 workers from 
the DeLand area. This in combination with the tourist end of the industry 
makes it one of the town's largest supporters and invaluable to the local 
economy.[13][14] Central Florida Warriors of the USA Rugby League are based 
in DeLand. DeLand has been the filming location for a number of television 
and movie projects, including the 1999 Adam Sandler comedy The Waterboy. 
Scenes showing the fictional South Central Louisiana State University Mud 
Dogs home football games were shot at Spec Martin Stadium. Classroom and 
exterior scenes were filmed at Stetson University. Scenes involving Sandler's 
character's home were actually filmed in neighboring DeBary. Ghost Story, 
starring Fred Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr and Craig Wasson, was filmed 
in part at Stetson University and the Holiday House. The HBO miniseries 
From the Earth to the Moon filmed several scenes on the campus of Stetson 
University. The 1999 independent film The First of May, starring Mickey 
Rooney and Joe DiMaggio, was shot on various locations throughout DeLand. 
Days of Thunder, starring Tom Cruise, was also partially filmed in DeLand. 
New Urban Cowboy: Toward a New Pedestrianism (2008) was filmed almost entirely 
in DeLand in 2006 and 2007.[15][16] Walt Before Mickey filmed several scenes 
at the Stetson University campus in 2014. Amtrak, the national passenger 
rail system, serves DeLand, operating its Silver Meteor and Silver Star 
trains daily in both directions between Miami and New York City. Local 
transit service is provided by VOTRAN on the #20 and #60 routes.[17] During 
the Second World War, the Babcock Airplane Corporation manufactured 60 
Waco CG-4 assault gliders at DeLand,[18] but the firm was out of business
