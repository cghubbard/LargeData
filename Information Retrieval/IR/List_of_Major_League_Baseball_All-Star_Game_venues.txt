The first All-Star Game was held as part of the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago, 
at Comiskey Park and was the brainchild of Arch Ward, then sports editor 
for the Chicago Tribune.[1] Initially intended to be a one-time event, 
its great success resulted in making the game an annual one. The venue 
for each All-Star Game is chosen by an MLB selection committee. This choice 
may be made to commemorate a particular historical occasion, the opening 
of a new ballpark, or a significant milestone. The criteria for choosing 
the venue are subjective; for the most part, cities with new parks and 
cities who have not hosted the game in a long time – or ever – tend to 
be favored. This time-sensitive subjectivity has resulted in some quirks 
in distributing the venues among the major league franchises; from 1964 
to 2015, five teams have hosted 3 times, 13 teams twice, ten teams once, 
and two teams not at all: As of 2016, two Major League Baseball franchises 
have never hosted an All-Star Game: the Tampa Bay Rays and the Miami Marlins, 
who are now scheduled to host in 2017 following the 2012 opening of Marlins 
Park. (Although Miami was initially scheduled to host in 2000, MLB eventually 
moved the game to Atlanta.) Although the Washington Nationals franchise 
haven't yet hosted the game in their current home ballpark, they did host 
one when they were the Montreal Expos; and All-Star games have been played 
in D.C., hosted by two incarnations of the Washington Senators (now known 
as the Minnesota Twins and as the Texas Rangers). Of the remaining 27 franchises, 
the New York Mets had gone the longest period without hosting since their 
sole hosting duty in 1964, but this streak came to an end at 49 years in 
2013. (The Dodgers are now the team with the longest active hosting drought, 
since 1980.) During that span, 18 of the remaining 25 teams have hosted 
an All-Star Game at least twice since 1964: Atlanta Braves (1972 and 2000), 
Chicago White Sox (1983 and 2003), Cincinnati Reds (1970, 1988, and 2015), 
Cleveland Indians (1981 and 1997), Detroit Tigers (1971 and 2005), Houston 
Astros (1968, 1986, and 2004), Kansas City Royals (1973 and 2012), Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim (1967, 1989, and 2010), Milwaukee Brewers (1975 
and 2002), Minnesota Twins (1965, 1985, and 2014), New York Yankees (1977 
and 2008), Philadelphia Phillies (1976 and 1996), Pittsburgh Pirates (1974, 
1994, and 2006), San Diego Padres (1978, 1992, and 2016), San Francisco 
Giants (1984 and 2007), Seattle Mariners (1979 and 2001), St. Louis Cardinals 
(1966 and 2009), and Washington Senators/Texas Rangers (1969 and 1995). 
Some of these decisions were due to new ballparks (the Twins have hosted 
in each of their three home fields, for example), but the nearly-identical 
symmetrical artificial-turfed parks in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Cincinnati 
each got two turns during this span, essentially subjecting viewers (during 
the even-numbered National League-hosted seasons) to six visits to the 
same ball park while Shea Stadium remained unused, and iconic venues such 
as Dodger Stadium and Wrigley Field were only employed once apiece. (The 
twice-used Houston Astrodome, while similarly AstroTurfed, was at least 
visually distinct from the other, over-employed "cookie cutter" synthetic-field 
stadiums.) Ironically enough, both Three Rivers Stadium (1994) and Veterans 
Stadium (1996) were demolished less than a decade after MLB chose to "spotlight" 
them with these repeat visits. New stadiums that have not hosted the All-Star 
Game in cities that have hosted it previously are: Citizens Bank Park in 
Philadelphia, Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., the new Yankee Stadium 
in New York City, and Marlins Park in Miami. However, three such ballparks—all 
from the National League—have been selected for upcoming All-Star Games: 
Petco Park hosted in 2016, Marlins Park will host in 2017 and Nationals 
Park will host in 2018. Following the game at the first Yankee Stadium 
in 2008 in its final season, the Bronx's old stadium joined Cleveland's 
old Cleveland Stadium (also known as Municipal Stadium prior to its own 
demolition) as the only venues that have hosted four Major League Baseball 
All-Star games. New York City has hosted it more than any other city, having 
done so nine times in five different stadiums; after 2017, Tampa Bay will 
remain the only major-league city since the first All-Star Game in 1933 
to never have hosted. The "home team" is the league in which the host franchise 
plays its games. Although the game's venue traditionally alternates between 
the two leagues from year to year, this tradition has been broken several 
times: In the first two decades of the game, ballparks in Philadelphia 
and St. Louis were home to more than one team. This led to some shorter-than-usual 
gaps between the use of those two ballparks: Shibe Park (later known as 
Connie Mack Stadium) in Philadelphia and Sportsman's Park (the third ballpark 
with that name; later known as Busch Stadium, the first of three stadiums 
with that name) in St. Louis. In Philadelphia, the A.L.'s Athletics hosted 
the game in 1943, and the NL's Phillies in 1952. In St. Louis, the National 
League's Cardinals hosted the game in 1940, and the American League's Browns 
in 1948. The only discontinued ballparks that hosted one All-Star Game 
are: Memorial Stadium (Baltimore) in 1959, Shea Stadium in 1964, Metropolitan 
Stadium in 1965, Busch Memorial Stadium in 1966, Fulton County Stadium 
in 1972, the Kingdome in 1979, Olympic Stadium (Montreal) in 1982, Hubert 
H. Humphrey Metrodome in 1985, and Turner Field in 2000. The following 
teams have hosted the All-Star Game in the summer then proceeded to host 
post-season games in the fall: League Championship Series play began 1969
