David W. Smith (born March 17, 1948) is an American baseball historian 
and statistician. He is best known as the founder of Retrosheet, an organization 
whose mission is to collect, digitize, and distribute play-by-play accounts 
from every game in Major League Baseball history. Smith's work has been 
widely praised as a huge boon to baseball research and he has received 
a number of awards for his work, most notably the SABR Bob Davids Award 
in 2005.[1] Smith was a contributor to Total Baseball and was co-author 
of the book The Midsummer Classic: The Complete History of Baseball's All-Star 
Game (with David W. Vincent and Lyle Spatz). That book received The Sporting 
News-SABR Baseball Research Award in 2001. Since 1975, Smith has been a 
professor of biology at the University of Delaware, and is director of 
the Department of Biological Sciences undergraduate program. He won the 
University's Excellence in Teaching Award in 1977. Smith did his undergraduate 
work at the University of California, San Diego and received his PhD from 
the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. Smith is a recipient of the 2012 Henry 
Chadwick Award from the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR).[2]
