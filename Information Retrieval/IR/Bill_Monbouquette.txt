William Charles Monbouquette (August 11, 1936 – January 25, 2015) was an 
American Major League Baseball (MLB) right-handed pitcher. He pitched for 
the Boston Red Sox (1958–65), Detroit Tigers (1966–67), New York Yankees 
(1967–68), and the San Francisco Giants (1968). He was an All-Star for 
three seasons of his 11-year major league career. Monbouquette compiled 
114 wins, 1,122 strikeouts, and a 3.68 earned run average during his major 
league career. A finesse pitcher who relied on changing speeds and a superb 
control, Monbouquette was signed by the Boston Red Sox as an amateur free 
agent in 1955 and started his majors career on July 18, 1958. He became 
the ace of a weak Boston pitching rotation in the early 1960s, winning 
at least 14 games from 1960 to 1963, with a career-high 20 victories in 
1963. An American league (AL) All-Star in 1960, 1962, and 1963, Monbouquette 
no-hit the Chicago White Sox 1-0 on August 1, 1962 at Comiskey Park; a 
second-inning walk to Al Smith was the only baserunner Monbouquette allowed. 
He also collected three one-hit games, and set a Red Sox record with a 
17 strikeout-game against the Washington Senators in 1961. On September 
25, 1965 in a game against the Kansas City A's, Monbouquette was the starting 
pitcher versus 58-year-old Hall of Famer Satchel Paige. Monbouquette threw 
a complete game for his tenth win of the season, but became the final strikeout 
victim of Paige's in the 3rd inning. After going 96-91 with Boston, Monbouquette 
was sent to the Detroit Tigers before the 1966 season. He also pitched 
for the New York Yankees and finished his career with the San Francisco 
Giants on September 3, 1968. He never made the postseason. Monbouquette 
was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2000. He was a pitching 
coach for Detroit Single-A affiliate team, Oneonta Tigers. Bill was also 
once professional hockey player Wayne Muloin's brother-in-law.[1] In May 
2008, the Boston Globe reported that Monbouquette was suffering from acute 
myelogenous leukemia. The chemotherapy and drug treatment he received had 
the disease in remission, but he needed a bone marrow and stem cell transplant 
to be cured.[2] The Red Sox, in conjunction with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 
on June 7, 2008 encouraged fans to enroll in the National Marrow Donor 
Registry at Tufts University in hopes of finding a suitable donor for Monbouquette 
and others suffering from the disease.[3] In 2010, the Boston rock band 
The Remains released a song, "Monbo Time", as a tribute to Monbouquette. 
The Remains pledged to donate 50% of the revenues they receive from sales 
of the song to cancer research. (06880danwoog.com, April 23, 2010; Boston 
Herald, April 22, 2010; nesn.com, April 14, 2010) Monbouquette died on 
January 25, 2015, aged 78 at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Medford Massachusetts.[4]
