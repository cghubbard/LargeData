William O. "Bill" DeWitt III is the current President of the St. Louis 
Cardinals. He has held his position since the 2008 season.[1] DeWitt is 
the third generation in a family with an extensive history with St. Louis 
baseball; he is the son of William DeWitt, Jr., currently owner, managing 
partner and chairman of the Cardinals, and the grandson of Bill DeWitt, 
a former St. Louis Browns and Cincinnati Reds owner and executive and a 
protégé of legendary Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey.[2] DeWitt 
grew up in Cincinnati but moved to St. Louis when his father's ownership 
group purchased the Cardinals in 1996.[2] He graduated from the Taft School 
(1986), earned an undergraduate degree from Yale (1990) and an MBA from 
Harvard Business School (1995).[3][4] Between earning his undergraduate 
and master's degrees, DeWitt served as an assistant to William K. Reilly, 
a former Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.[4] Before 
his appointment as Cardinals' president, DeWitt joined the Cardinals and 
became the head of merchandizing in 1996.[5] He also gained experience 
in marketing and operational tasks. He helped develop the Cardinals' spring 
training home in Jupiter, Florida, Roger Dean Stadium, which opened in 
1998.[5][6] After becoming the team's senior vice president of business 
development, he led the design and construction of the Cardinals' ballpark, 
Busch Stadium, which opened in 2006.[4] DeWitt's predecessor, Mark Lamping, 
resigned in March 2008 when the NFL's New York Giants hired him to be president 
of New Meadowlands Stadium Company.[7] Since his appointment as team president, 
DeWitt has overseen the business operations of the Cardinals, including 
sales, marketing, finances, accounting, game-day productions and other 
miscellaneous ventures.[2] He also captains the development of Ballpark 
Village, a 100,000 square foot retail development district adjacent to 
Busch Stadium.[4] Married to Ira DeWitt, the couple have a son, Will, and 
a daughter, Natalie. In his spare time, DeWitt plays golf and ice hockey.[4] 
Mrs. DeWitt is from Canada and is of Armenian descent. Also a businesswoman, 
she is the owner of St. Louis-based Notifi Records, an urban contemporary 
record label whose roster includes Ginuwine, Johnny Gill and Bos. She earned 
a Ph.D. in psychology and education from St. Louis University in 1998.[8]
