player. A shortstop, Fontana plays in Minor League Baseball. He is a member 
of the Houston Astros organization. Before he began his professional career, 
he attended the University of Florida, and played college baseball for 
the Florida Gators. Fontana was born in Richardson, Texas,[1] but was raised 
in Winter Garden, Florida.[2] He played Little League Baseball in Pine 
Hills, Florida. As a nine-year-old playing in the 12-and-under division, 
he did not strikeout once until the final game of the year.[3] Fontana 
attended West Orange High School in Winter Garden. In 2008, he played in 
a regional final despite having mononucleosis.[3] Fontana enrolled at the 
University of Florida, where he played for the Florida Gators baseball 
team in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) of the National Collegiate Athletic 
Association's Division I. As a freshman, he had a .287 batting average, 
and committed only four errors. He won a Gold Glove Award for his defensive 
play, and was named a Freshman All-American.[2] Fontana played for the 
United States national collegiate baseball team in the summer of 2010. 
Fontana and Gators teammate Brian Johnson were the only two freshmen on 
the team.[3][4] In 2011, Fontana was a semifinalist for the Brooks Wallace 
Award as the nation's top shortstop.[2][5] He had a .289 batting average 
for the Gators, who were the runners-up in the 2011 College World Series 
(CWS). He was named to the SEC Tournament's All-Tournament team, and to 
the SEC All-Defensive team for his second consecutive year. Fontana was 
named a preseason All-American before the 2012 season.[2] In his junior 
year at Florida, he compiled a .284 batting average, a .406 on-base percentage, 
nine home runs, ten doubles, and 30 runs batted in, as the Gators reached 
the 2012 CWS.[1] The Houston Astros selected Fontana in the second round, 
with the 61st overall selection, of the 2012 MLB Draft. He received a $875,000 
signing bonus from the Astros, and reported to the Lexington Legends of 
the Class A South Atlantic League.[1][6] He reached base six times in his 
professional debut.[7] Though he only batted .225, he drew 65 walks in 
49 games played, leading to a .464 on-base percentage.[8] In 2013, the 
Astros invited him to spring training.[8] He spent the 2013 season with 
the Lancaster JetHawks of the Class A-Advanced California League, where 
he had more walks (102) than strikeouts (100) in 104 games played. After 
the season, he played in the Arizona Fall League.[9] He opened the 2014

The Astros again invited Fontana to spring training in 2015.[11] He played 
for the Fresno Grizzlies of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League in 2015.[12] 
After the 2015 season, the Astros added Fontana to their 40-man roster, 
protecting him from being eligible in the Rule 5 draft.[13] In 2016, Fontana 
was hitting .195 in 73 games for Fresno. On July 14, he was demoted to
