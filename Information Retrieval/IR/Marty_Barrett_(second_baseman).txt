For the 19th-century baseball catcher, see Marty Barrett (catcher). Martin 
Glenn Barrett (born June 23, 1958) is an American former Major League Baseball 
second baseman who played for the Boston Red Sox (1982–1990) and San Diego 
Padres (1991). Barrett was born in Arcadia, California. He is an alumnus 
of Arizona State University, and the brother of Tommy Barrett, another 
former MLB player who played for the Philadelphia Phillies. Marty played 
in the longest professional baseball game in history in 1981, a minor league 
game between the Pawtucket Red Sox and the Rochester Red Wings. Barrett 
had the distinction of scoring the winning run for Pawtucket in the bottom 
of the 33rd inning.[1] An excellent second baseman with an above-average 
arm, Barrett was known as a smart player and a great contact hitter, striking 
out only 209 times in 3378 at-bats, and collecting a significant number 
of big hits by driving tough pitches to the opposite field. He often was 
used as a specialist in bunting situations, leading the American League 
in sacrifice hits for three consecutive years (1986–88). In a ten-year 
career Barrett was a .278 hitter with 18 home runs and 314 RBI in 941 games. 
Barrett successfully pulled off the hidden ball trick three times, including 
twice in July 1985.[2] In 1984 Barrett batted a career-high .303 in his 
first full season. But his most productive year was 1986, when he posted 
career-highs in RBI (60), hits (179), doubles (39), triples (4), stolen 
bases (15) and games played (158).[3] He starred in the 1986 postseason, 
when he set a major league record with 24 hits in 14 postseason games, 
and was named the ALCS Most Valuable Player. In the 1986 World Series Barrett 
had 13 hits in 30 at bats (.433 BA), and posted an on-base percentage of 
.514 against the New York Mets. Near the conclusion of Game Six, he had 
been selected by the NBC Television broadcast team as the Player of the 
Game. He was the final batter in the series, striking out against Mets 
closer, Jesse Orosco. Barrett held the starting second baseman position 
with the Red Sox for most of the 1980s. On June 4, 1989, he suffered a 
serious knee injury while tripping over first base following a ground out. 
Jody Reed took over as the starter, and Barrett played only sporadically 
following his recovery.[4] During the final game of the 1990 ALCS, Red 
Sox pitcher, Roger Clemens, was ejected in the bottom of the second inning. 
Barrett protested the call by heaving plastic water containers onto the 
field, and also was thrown out of the game.[5] It was his last game for 
the Red Sox and he was released following the season. Barrett signed with 
the San Diego Padres in 1991. In his National League debut he was called 
upon as a pinch hitter to face the San Francisco Giants' Dave Righetti, 
with two outs in the ninth inning. Barrett, not known for his power stroke, 
hit the ball into the left field stands for a three-run home run.[6] He 
would only appear in 11 more games with the Padres, a knee injury ending
