The 2012 Texas Rangers season was the 52nd season in the overall history 
of the franchise and the 41st since the team relocated to Arlington, Texas. 
The Rangers entered the season as the two-time defending champions of the 
American League and the AL West. They led the division for most of the 
season and had a 13-game lead on June 30, but faltered down the stretch. 
They finished 93-69, but were swept in the last series of the season by 
the Oakland Athletics and wound up second to the Athletics in the division. 
They then lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the Wild Card Game and were 
eliminated from the playoffs. Infielders Outfielders Coaches LEAGUE CHAMPIONS:
