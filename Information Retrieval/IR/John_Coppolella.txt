John Coppolella (born July 28, 1978) is an American baseball front office 
executive who serves as the general manager of the Atlanta Braves of Major 
League Baseball (MLB). Upon graduation from the University of Notre Dame,[2] 
Coppolella was offered a job by Intel. He chose to continue exploring opportunities 
in baseball, and turned Intel down for an internship with the New York 
Yankees, working for the MLB team from 2000 through 2006.[3][4] He then 
joined the Braves as their director of baseball operations. He held that 
position until 2011, when he served as director of professional scouting. 
In 2012, Coppolella was promoted to assistant general manager. After Frank 
Wren was fired as the Braves' general manager after the 2014 season, John 
Hart took over as the president of baseball operations of the Braves,[5] 
with Coppolella heavily involved in the team's transactions,[6] including 
the trades of Craig Kimbrel and Jason Heyward. The Braves announced on 
October 1, 2015, that Coppolella was promoted to general manager, and signed 
to a four-year contract.[7][8] Coppolella is married and has three children.[9][10]
