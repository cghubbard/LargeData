Herbert Jefferis Pennock (February 10, 1894 – January 30, 1948) was an 
American professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball 
from 1912 through 1933. He is best known for his time spent with the star-studded 
New York Yankee teams of the mid to late 1920s and early 1930s. Connie 
Mack signed Pennock to his Philadelphia Athletics in 1912. After using 
Pennock sparingly, and questioning his competitive drive, Mack sold Pennock 
to the Boston Red Sox in 1915. After returning from military service in 
1919, Pennock became a regular contributor for the Red Sox. The Yankees 
acquired Pennock from the Red Sox after the 1922 season, and he served 
as a key member of the pitching staff as the Yankees won four World Series 
championships during his tenure with the team. After retiring as a player, 
Pennock served as a coach and farm system director for the Red Sox, and 
as general manager of the Philadelphia Phillies. Pennock was regarded as 
one of the greatest left-handed pitchers in baseball history. Mack later 
called his sale of Pennock to the Red Sox his greatest mistake. Pennock 
died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1948; later that year, he was posthumously 
inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Pennock was born on February 
10, 1894 in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. His father, Theodore Pennock, 
and mother Mary Louise Pennock (née Sharp) were of Scotch-Irish and Quaker 
descent.[1] His ancestors came to the United States with William Penn.[2] 
Herb was the youngest of four children.[1] Pennock attended Westtown School 
and Cedarcroft Boarding School, where he played for the baseball team. 
After struggling as a first baseman, with a weak offensive output and throwing 
arm that resulted in curved throws, his Cedarcroft coach converted Pennock 
into a pitcher.[1] While pitching at Cedarcroft, Pennock threw a no-hitter 
to catcher Earle Mack, the son of Connie Mack, manager of the Philadelphia 
Athletics, in 1910. Pennock agreed to sign with the Athletics at a later 
date.[3] Mack signed Pennock in 1912 to play for his collegiate team based 
in Atlantic City. Pennock's father insisted that he sign under an alias 
in order to protect his collegiate eligibility. Pennock threw a no-hitter 
against a traveling Negro league baseball team, and Mack promoted him to 
the Athletics.[1] Mack intended for Pennock to be one of the prospects 
who would replace star pitchers Eddie Plank, Chief Bender, and Jack Coombs.[4] 
Pennock made his major league debut with the Athletics during the 1912 
season on May 14, allowing one hit in four innings pitched.[1] He was the 
youngest person to play in the American League (AL) that season.[5] Former 
major leaguer Mike Grady, a neighbor of Pennock's in Kennett Square, took 
Pennock under his wing, while Bender taught Pennock to throw a screwball.[1] 
Pennock missed most of the 1913 season with an illness.[1] In the 1914 
season, Pennock posted an 11–4 win–loss record with a 2.79 earned run average 
(ERA) in 151 2⁄3 innings pitched for the Athletics, and pitched three scoreless 
innings in the 1914 World Series, which the Athletics lost to the Boston 
Braves. Mack let Bender go after the season, naming Pennock his Opening 
Day starting pitcher in 1915. On Opening Day, Pennock threw a one-hit complete 
game shutout against the Boston Red Sox.[1] However, as the Athletics struggled, 
Pennock's nonchalant playing style drew Mack's ire. Concluding that Pennock 
"lacked ambition", Mack sold Pennock to the Red Sox for the waiver price 
of $2,500 ($58,577 in current dollar terms).[1][6] Mack later regarded 
this sale as his greatest mistake.[7] With a deep pitching staff in place, 
the Red Sox loaned Pennock to the Providence Grays of the International 
League in August for the remainder of the 1915 season.[1][8] He split the 
1916 season between the Red Sox and the Buffalo Bisons, also in the International 
League. With Buffalo, Pennock pitched to a 1.67 ERA, as Buffalo won the 
league pennant.[9] Though the Red Sox won the 1915 and 1916 World Series, 
Pennock did not appear in either series.[10][11] Pitching in minor league 
baseball, Pennock began to regain confidence.[1] However, Boston manager 
Jack Barry used Pennock sparingly in the 1917 season, and Pennock enlisted 
in the United States Navy in 1918.[12] Pennock pitched for a team fielded 
by the Navy, defeating a team composed of members of the United States 
Army in an exhibition for George VI, the King of England, in Stamford Bridge. 
After the game, Ed Barrow, the new manager of the Red Sox, signed Pennock 
to a new contract after promising to use him regularly during the 1919 
season.[1] Pennock received only one start apiece in the months of April 
and May, as the 1919 Red Sox relied on George Dumont, Bill James, and Bullet 
Joe Bush, leading Pennock to threaten to quit in late-May unless Barrow 
fulfilled his earlier promise to Pennock. Barrow continued to use Pennock 
regularly after Memorial Day,[1] and Pennock finished the season with a 
16–8 win-loss record and a 2.71 ERA in 219 innings pitched. He served as 
the team's ace pitcher in the 1920 season, but subsequently settled in 
as the Red Sox' third starter.[1] After the 1922 Red Sox campaign, in which 
he went 10–17, and had seven wild pitches, leading the AL,[13] the New 
York Yankees began to negotiate with the Red Sox to acquire Pennock.[14] 
The Yankees traded Norm McMillan, George Murray, and Camp Skinner to the 
Red Sox for Pennock that offseason.[15] Pennock pitched to a 19–6 win-loss 
record in the 1923 season, his first with the Yankees, leading the American 
League (AL) in winning percentage (.760) and finishing sixth in wins.[16] 
Pitching in the 1923 World Series, Pennock defeated the New York Giants 
in game two, on October 11, to end their eight-game World Series winning 
streak.[1][17] He recorded a save in securing the Yankees' win in game 
four, and pitched to the win in game six on one day of rest, clinching 
the Yankees' first World Series championship.[1][17] Umpire Billy Evans 
called it "the greatest pitching performance I have ever seen", as Pennock 
"had nothing."[1][18] In the 1924 season, he pitched to a 21–9 win-loss 
record with a 2.83 ERA while striking out a career-high 101 batters. His 
win total was second in the AL, behind Walter Johnson, while his ERA was 
third behind Johnson and Tom Zachary, and he finished fourth in strikeouts 
behind Johnson, Howard Ehmke, and teammate Bob Shawkey.[19] Pennock's 277 
innings pitched and 1.220 walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) ratio 
led the AL in the 1925 season, while his 2.96 ERA was second-best, behind 
Stan Coveleski.[20] In the 1926 season, he posted a career-high 23 wins, 
finishing second in the AL to George Uhle. He again led the AL in WHIP 
(1.265), and issued the fewest walks per nine innings pitched (1.453).[21] 
During the pennant race, The Sporting News called Pennock the "best left-hander 
in the majors".[1] Pennock earned the wins in game one and game five of 
the 1926 World Series. He finished game seven of the series, which the 
Yankees lost to the St. Louis Cardinals.[22] The Yankees reached the World 
Series, facing the Pittsburgh Pirates. Pennock pitched a complete game 
against the Pirates in game three of the 1927 World Series, not allowing 
a hit until the eighth inning. Pennock's performance drew praise from teammate 
Babe Ruth.[23] The Yankees swept the series from Pittsburgh.[24] After 
pitching a three-hit shutout against the Red Sox on August 12, 1928, he 
missed the remainder of the season, including the 1928 World Series, with 
an arm injury. His five shutouts and 0.085 home runs per nine innings pitched 
led the AL. His 2.56 ERA trailed only Garland Braxton, while his 17 wins 
tied for eighth place.[25] Though the Yankees defeated the Cardinals in 
the 1928 World Series,[26] the Yankees' starting rotation without Pennock 
was likened to "a three-stringed ukulele."[1] In the 1929 season, Pennock 
saw his pitching time and pitching quality diminish. Over the rest of his 
career, he never posted more than 189 innings pitched in a season and his 
ERA rose to over 4.00. He suffered from bouts of neuritis in 1929 and 1930.[27] 
Pennock won his 200th career game during the 1929 season, becoming the 
third left-handed pitcher to reach that mark.[1] He led the AL in walks 
per nine innings pitched in 1930 (1.151)[28] and 1931 (1.426).[29] Pennock 
pitched four innings of relief against the Chicago Cubs in the 1932 World 
Series, recording two saves.[30] The New York chapter of the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America named him their player of the year.[31] In 1933, 
serving exclusively as a relief pitcher, Pennock had a 7–4 win-loss record 
in 23 appearances.[32] After the 1933 season, the Yankees honored Pennock 
with a testimonial dinner on January 6, 1934, and then gave him his release.[1][31] 
Eddie Collins, a former teammate with the Athletics now serving as the 
general manager of the Red Sox, signed Pennock to their 1934 roster.[32] 
In his last season pitching in the major leagues, Pennock served as a relief 
pitcher for the Red Sox.[1] Pennock retired with a career record of 240 
wins, 162 losses, and a 3.60 ERA. Pennock pitched in five World Series, 
one with Philadelphia and four with New York. He was a member of four World 
Series championship teams. In World Series play, Pennock amassed a 5–0 
career win-loss record with three saves, becoming the second pitcher to 
win five World Series games, after Coombs.[33] Pennock was a part of seven 
World Series championship teams (1913, 1915, 1916, 1923, 1927, 1928, and 
1932), though he played in four World Series' as a member of the winning 
team. Many, including Mack, consider Pennock among the greatest left-handed 
pitchers of all time.[1][7] Pennock became the general manager of the Charlotte 
Hornets, a Red Sox' farm team of the Piedmont League, prior to the 1935 
season.[34] He returned to the Red Sox in 1936, serving as the first base 
and pitching coach under manager Joe Cronin.[35] He served in this role 
through the 1938 season. In 1939, Pennock served as the Assistant Supervisor 
of Boston's minor league system, reporting to Evans. Pennock succeeded 
Evans as Director of Minor League Operations late in the 1940 season.[1][36] 
In December 1943, R. R. M. Carpenter, Jr., the new owner of the Philadelphia 
Phillies, hired Pennock as his general manager,[37] after receiving a recommendation 
from Mack. Carpenter gave Pennock a lifetime contract. Pennock filled Carpenter's 
duties when the team's owner was drafted into service during World War 
II in 1944. As general manager, Pennock changed the team's name to the 
"Blue Jays", and invested $1 million ($13,465,028 in current dollar terms) 
into players who would become known as the "Whiz Kids", who won the National 
League pennant in 1950, including Curt Simmons and Willie Jones.[1] He 
also created a "Grandstand Managers Club", the first in baseball history, 
allowing fans to give feedback to the team,[38] and advocated for the repeal 
of the Bonus Rule.[39] Pennock opposed racial integration in baseball.[1] 
In 1947, when Jackie Robinson was signed to the Brooklyn Dodgers, Pennock 
called Dodgers team president Branch Rickey before the Dodgers' series 
in Philadelphia and told him not to "bring that nigger here with the rest 
of the team."[40] He further threatened to boycott a 1947 game between 
the Phillies and Dodgers if Robinson played.[41][42] In 1948, at the age 
of 53, one week and four days before his 54th birthday, Pennock collapsed 
in the lobby of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage. 
He was pronounced dead upon his arrival at Midtown Hospital.[43] Pennock 
had been healthy, even inviting friends to join him at Madison Square Garden 
to attend a boxing match.[44] Pennock was honored with "Herb Pennock Day" 
on April 30, 1944 in Kennett Square.[1] Weeks after his death, Pennock 
was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.[45] An attempt to erect 
a statue in Kennett Square in his honor was blocked due to his support 
of segregation in baseball.[41][42] Fred Heimach, a teammate of Pennock, 
once called him the smartest ball player he knew.[46] In 1981, Lawrence 
Ritter and Donald Honig included Pennock in their book The 100 Greatest 
Baseball Players of All Time. He was inducted in the International League 
Hall of Fame in 1948.[9] Noted baseball photographer Charles M. Conlon 
considered Pennock one of his favorite subjects to photograph.[47] Pennock 
was nicknamed "the Squire of Kennett Square."[4][48] He married Esther 
M. Freck, his high school sweetheart and the younger sister of a childhood 
friend, on October 28, 1915. Esther often attended spring training and 
traveled with her husband's team during the season. Together, the couple 
had a daughter, Jane (born 1920), and a son, Joe (born 1925). Jane later 
married Eddie Collins, Jr..[49] While a member of the Yankees, Pennock 
rented an apartment on Grand Concourse in The Bronx, where his wife and 
children stayed while the Yankees played their home games.[1] Pennock was 
a proficient horse rider.[50] He also raised hounds and silver foxes for 
their pelts.[48][51] He also grew flowers and vegetables on his farm.[4]
