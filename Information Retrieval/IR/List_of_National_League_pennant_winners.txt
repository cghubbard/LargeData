Each season, a National League team wins the league's pennant, signifying 
that they are its champion and they win the right to play in the World 
Series against the champion of the American League. In addition to the 
pennant, the team that wins the National League playoffs receives the Warren 
C. Giles Trophy,[1] named after Warren Giles, who was the league president 
from 1951 to 1969. Warren's son Bill Giles, the honorary league president 
and owner of the Philadelphia Phillies, presents the trophy to the National 
League champion at the conclusion of each National League Championship 
Series (NLCS).[1] The current National League pennant winners are the Chicago 
Cubs, who won their 17th NL pennant in October 2016. For most of the history 
of the National League (94 years), the pennant was presented to the team 
with the best win–loss record at the end of the season.[2] The first modern 
World Series was played in 1903, and after a hiatus in 1904, continued 
until 1994,[3] when a players' strike forced the cancellation of the postseason,[4] 
and resumed in 1995.[3] In 1969, the league split into two divisions,[5] 
and the teams with the best records in each division played one another 
in the NLCS to determine the pennant winner. The format of the NLCS was 
changed from a best-of-five to a best-of-seven format for the 1985 postseason.[6] 
In 1995, an additional playoff series was added when Major League Baseball 
restructured the two divisions in each league into three.[7] As of 2010[update], 
the winners of the Eastern, Central, and Western Divisions, as well as 
one wild card team, play in the National League Division Series, a best-of-five 
playoff to determine the opponents who will play for the pennant.[8] By 
pennants, the San Francisco Giants (formerly the New York Giants) (22 National 
League pennants, 28 playoff appearances)[9] are the winningest team in 
the National League. The Los Angeles Dodgers (formerly the Brooklyn Dodgers; 
21 pennants, 27 playoff appearances).[10] have the second-most. In third 
place is the St. Louis Cardinals (19 pennants and 27 playoff appearances),[11] 
followed by the Atlanta Braves (17 pennants and 23 postseason appearances 
between their three home cities of Atlanta, Milwaukee, and Boston)[12] 
and the Chicago Cubs (17 pennants and 20 playoff appearances [as the Cubs 
and White Stockings]).[13] The Philadelphia Phillies won the league in 
back-to-back seasons in 2008 and 2009, becoming the first National League 
team to do so since the Braves in 1995 and 1996.[14] Before 1903 there 
was no World Series as we know it today because the leagues were only loosely 
affiliated. As of 2014, the San Francisco Giants have the most World Series 
appearances at 20, followed by the St. Louis Cardinals with 19 and the 
Los Angeles Dodgers with 18. The team with the best record to win the National 
League pennant was the 1906 Cubs, who won 116 of 152 games during that 
season[15] and finished 20 games ahead of the Giants, playing in New York 
at the time.[16] The best record by a pennant-winner in the Championship 
Series era is 108–54, which was achieved by the Cincinnati Reds in 1975[17] 
and the New York Mets in 1986;[18] both of these teams went on to win the 
World Series.[3] National League champions have gone on to win the World 
Series 48 times, most recently in 2016.[3] Pennant-winners have also won 
the Temple Cup and the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup, two pre-World Series league 
championships, although second-place teams won three of the four Temple 
Cup meetings.[19][20] The largest margin of victory for a pennant-winner, 
before the league split into two divisions in 1969, is 27 1⁄2 games; the 
Pittsburgh Pirates led the Brooklyn Superbas (now the Dodgers) by that
