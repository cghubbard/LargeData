The following include various records set by umpires in Major League Baseball. 
Leagues are abbreviated as follows: The following are those umpires who 
have officiated in at least 3,000 major league games through the 2015 season.[1] 
Although the totals reflect all games umpired, the years indicate only 
those seasons in which each individual was employed as a league umpire, 
omitting seasons in which they may have acted as an emergency substitute 
during their playing career. Umpires who were active in 2015 are indicated 
in bold face; members of the Baseball Hall of Fame are indicated in italics:

by a † following the year. The position of crew chief was not as clearly 
established in the early years of the 20th century; for the purpose of 
this list, the crew chief for early World Series is defined as the home 
plate umpire for Game 1. The World Series has been played from 1903–present, 
except 1904 and 1994. The position of crew chief usually alternated between 
umpires of the American League and National League, with NL umpires serving 
as crew chief in odd-numbered years from 1903 through 1933 except for 1905, 
1917 and 1923, and again from 1995 through 1999, and in even-numbered years 
in 1906, 1912, 1918 through 1922, and 1936 through 1992. After the AL and 
NL staffs were merged in 2000, the position of crew chief was awarded to 
a former NL umpire every year through 2007. Most Series Most Series games

† following the year. There were two All-Star Games each year from 1959 
to 1962; different umpiring crews were used for the games in each year 
except 1960 (for this list, the 1960 umpires are each counted once). For 
all games through the first 1961 contest and again in 1966, the umpires 
changed positions halfway through the game; both plate umpires are noted
