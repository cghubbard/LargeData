Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) or Mastercard Worldwide is an American 
multinational financial services corporation headquartered in the MasterCard 
International Global Headquarters, Purchase, New York, United States,[1] 
in Westchester County. The Global Operations Headquarters is located in 
O'Fallon, Missouri, United States, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. Throughout 
the world, its principal business is to process payments between the banks 
of merchants and the card issuing banks or credit unions of the purchasers 
who use the "Mastercard" brand debit and credit cards to make purchases. 
Mastercard Worldwide has been a publicly traded company since 2006. Prior 
to its initial public offering, MasterCard Worldwide was a cooperative 
owned by the more than 25,000 financial institutions that issue its branded 
cards. Mastercard, originally known as Interbank/Master Charge,[2] was 
created by several California banks as a competitor to the BankAmericard 
issued by Bank of America, which later became the Visa credit card issued 
by Visa Inc. From 1966 to 1979, Mastercard was called "Interbank" and "Master 
Charge". The original banks behind MasterCard were United California Bank 
(later First Interstate Bank and subsequently merged into Wells Fargo Bank), 
Wells Fargo, Crocker National Bank (also subsequently merged into Wells 
Fargo), and the Bank of California (subsequently merged into the Union 
Bank of California). In 1966, the aforementioned group of California banks 
formed the Interbank Card Association (ICA). With the help of New York's 
Marine Midland Bank, now HSBC Bank USA, these banks joined with the ICA 
to create "Master Charge: The Interbank Card". The card was given a significant 
boost in 1969, when First National City Bank joined, merging its proprietary 
Everything Card with Master Charge. In 1968, the ICA and Eurocard started 
a strategic alliance, which effectively allowed the ICA access to the European 
market, and for Eurocard to be accepted on the ICA network. The Access 
card system from the United Kingdom joined the ICA/Eurocard alliance in 
1972. In 1979, "Master Charge: The Interbank Card" was renamed simply "MasterCard". 
In the early 1990s MasterCard then bought the British Access card and the 
Access name was dropped. In 2002, MasterCard International merged with 
Europay International SA, another large credit-card issuer association, 
which for many years issued cards under the name Eurocard (payment card). 
In 2006, MasterCard International underwent another name change to MasterCard 
Worldwide. This was done in order to suggest a more global scale of operations. 
In addition, the company introduced a new corporate logo adding a third 
circle to the two that had been used in the past (the familiar card logo, 
resembling a Venn diagram, remains unchanged). A new corporate tagline 
was introduced at the same time: "The Heart of Commerce".[3] In 2010, MasterCard 
expanded its e-commerce offering with the acquisition of DataCash, a UK-based 
payment processing and fraud/risk management provider.[4][5] In 2012, MasterCard 
announced the expansion of its mobile contactless payments program, including 
markets across the Middle East.[6] In 2014, MasterCard acquired Australian 
leading rewards program manager company Pinpoint for an undisclosed amount.[7] 
MasterCard teamed with Apple in September 2014, to incorporate a new mobile 
wallet feature into Apple's new iPhone models, enabling users to more readily 
use their MasterCard, and other credit cards.[8] The company, which had 
been organized as a cooperative of banks, had an initial public offering 
on May 25, 2006 at 39.00 USD. The stock is traded on the NYSE under the 
symbol MA with the market capitalization of $105.15B (as of August 2016).[9] 
MasterCard, along with Visa, has been sued in a class action by ATM operators 
that claims the credit card networks' rules effectively fix ATM access 
fees. The suit claims that this is a restraint on trade in violation of 
federal law. The lawsuit was filed by the National ATM Council and independent 
operators of automated teller machines. More specifically, it is alleged 
that MasterCard's and Visa's network rules prohibit ATM operators from 
offering lower prices for transactions over PIN-debit networks that are 
not affiliated with Visa or MasterCard. The suit says that this price fixing 
artificially raises the price that consumers pay using ATMs, limits the 
revenue that ATM-operators earn, and violates the Sherman Act's prohibition 
against unreasonable restraints of trade. Johnathan Rubin, an attorney 
for the plaintiffs said, "Visa and MasterCard are the ringleaders, organizers, 
and enforcers of a conspiracy among U.S. banks to fix the price of ATM 
access fees in order to keep the competition at bay." [10] Both MasterCard 
and Visa have paid approximately $3 billion in damages resulting from a 
class-action lawsuit filed by Hagens Berman in January 1996.[11] The litigation 
cites several retail giants as plaintiffs, including Wal-Mart, Sears, Roebuck 
& Co., and Safeway.[12] In October 2010, Visa and MasterCard reached a 
settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in another antitrust case. 
The companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline 
certain types of cards (because interchange fees differ), or to offer consumers 
discounts for using cheaper cards.[13] On November 27, 2012, a federal 
judge entered an order granting preliminary approval to a proposed settlement 
to a class-action lawsuit filed in 2005 by merchants and trade associations 
against MasterCard, Visa, and many credit card issuers. The suit was filed 
due to price fixing and other anti-competitive trade practices employed 
by MasterCard and Visa. A majority of named-class plaintiffs have objected 
and vowed to opt out of the settlement. Opponents object to provisions 
that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out 
of significant portions of the proposed settlement. Stephen Neuwirth, a 
lawyer representing Home Depot, said, “It’s so obvious Visa and MasterCard 
were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases 
being given. It’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the Home Depot 
are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this 
is a bad deal.” [14] Plaintiffs allege that Visa, MasterCard, and major 
credit card issuers engaged in a conspiracy to fix interchange fees, also 
known as swipe fees, that are charged to merchants for the privilege of 
accepting payment cards at artificially high levels. In their complaint, 
the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with 
merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment 
such as lower-cost cards, cash, and checks.[14] The settlement provides 
for the cash equivalent of a 10 basis-point reduction (0.1 percent) of 
swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months. This eight-month 
period would probably begin in the middle of 2013. The total value of the 
settlement will be about $7.25 billion.[14] Few companies have faced more 
antitrust lawsuits both in the US and abroad.[15] MasterCard, along with 
Visa, engaged in systematic parallel exclusion against American Express 
during the 1980s and 1990s. MasterCard used exclusivity clauses in its 
contracts and blacklists to prevent banks from doing business with American 
Express. Such exclusionary clauses and other written evidence was used 
by the United States Department of Justice in regulatory actions against 
MasterCard and Visa.[16] Discover has sued MasterCard for similar issues.[15] 
In 1996 about 4 million merchants sued MasterCard in federal court for 
making them accept debit cards if they wanted to accept credit cards and 
dramatically increasing credit card swipe fees. This case was settled with 
a multibillion-dollar payment in 2003. This was the largest anti-trust 
award in history.[15] In 1998, the Department of Justice sued MasterCard 
over rules prohibiting their issuing banks from doing business with American 
Express or Discover. The Department of Justice won in 2001 and the verdict 
withstood appeal. American Express also filed suit[15] On August 23, 2001, 
MasterCard International Inc. was sued for violating the Florida Deceptive 
and Unfair Trade Practices Act.[17] On November 15, 2004, MasterCard Inc. 
paid damages to American Express, due to anticompetitive practices that 
prevented American Express from issuing cards through U.S. banks,[18] and 
paid 1.8 billion dollars for settlement.[19] The European Union has repeatedly 
criticised MasterCard for monopolistic trade practices. In April 2009, 
MasterCard reached a settlement with the European Union in an antitrust 
case, promising to reduce debit card swipe fees to 0.2 percent of purchases.[20] 
In December 2010, a senior official from the European Central Bank called 
for a break-up of the Visa/MasterCard duopoly by creation of a new European 
debit card for use in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).[21] WikiLeaks 
published documents showing that American authorities lobbied Russia to 
defend the interests of Visa and MasterCard.[22] In response MasterCard 
blocked payments to WikiLeaks. Members of the European Parliament expressed 
concern that payments from European citizens to a European corporation 
could apparently be blocked by the United States, and called for a further 
reduction in the dominance of Visa and MasterCard in the European payment 
system.[23] As of 2013, MasterCard is under investigation by the European 
Union for the high fees it charges tourists who use their cards in Europe, 
and other anti-competitive practices that could hinder electronic commerce 
and international trade, and high fees associated with premium credit cards. 
The EU's competition regulator said that these fees were of special concern 
because of the growing role of non-cash payments. MasterCard charges non-European 
tourists much more than customers using cards issued in Europe. MasterCard 
could be fined up to 10 percent of its 2012 revenue or around $740 million. 
MasterCard was banned from charging fees on cross-border transactions conducted 
wholly within the EU via a ruling by the European Commission in 2007.[24] 
The European Commission said that their investigation also includes large 
differences in fees across national borders. For instance, a 50-euro payment 
might cost 10 euro cents in the Netherlands but eight times that amount 
in Poland. The Commission argues that MasterCard rules that prohibit merchants 
from enjoying better terms offered in other EU countries may be against 
anti-trust law. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) praised the action 
against MasterCard. BEUC said interbank fees push up prices and hurt consumers. 
BEUC Director General Monique Goyens said, ""So in the end, all consumers 
are hit by a scheme which ultimately rewards the card company and issuing 
bank." [24] On December 27, 2014, Visa Inc. and MasterCard suspended servicing 
some Russian banks in Crimea:[25] Rossiya Bank, Sobinbank, SMP Bank and 
Investcapitalbank,[26] after the USA issued sanctions against the Russian 
government due to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine. In 
2003, the Reserve Bank of Australia required that interchange fees be dramatically 
reduced, from about 0.95% of the transaction to approximately 0.5%.[citation 
needed] One notable result has been the reduced use of reward cards and 
increased use of debit cards. Australia also prohibited the "no surcharge" 
rule, a policy established by credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard 
to prevent merchants from charging a credit card usage fee to the cardholder. 
A surcharge would mitigate or even exceed the merchant discount paid by 
a merchant, but would also make the cardholder more reluctant to use the 
card as the method of payment. Australia has also made changes to the interchange 
rates on debit cards and has considered abolishing interchange fees altogether. 
As of November 2006, New Zealand was considering similar actions, following 
a Commerce Commission lawsuit alleging price-fixing by Visa and MasterCard. 
In New Zealand, merchants pay a 1.8% fee on every credit card transaction. 
In December 2010, MasterCard blocked all payments to WikiLeaks due to claims 
that they engage in illegal activity.[27] In a response, a group of online 
activists calling themselves "Anonymous" organised a denial-of-service 
attack; as a result, the MasterCard website experienced downtime on December 
8–9, 2010.[28] On December 9, 2010 the servers of MasterCard underwent 
a massive attack[29] as part of an Operation Avenge Assange for closing 
down payments of whistleblowing platform WikiLeaks. According to several 
news sites, security of thousands of credit cards was compromised during 
that attack due to a phishing-site set up by the attackers.[30] However, 
MasterCard denied this, stating that "cardholder account data has not been 
placed at risk".[31] WikiLeaks spokesman said: “We neither condemn nor 
applaud these attacks."[32] U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi 
Pillay said that closing down credit lines for donations to WikiLeaks "could 
be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information, 
thus potentially violating WikiLeaks' right to freedom of expression".[33] 
The company that enables WikiLeaks to accept credit and debit card donations[who?] 
said it would take legal action against Visa Europe and MasterCard.[34] 
Iceland-based IT firm DataCell said it would move immediately to try to 
force the two companies to resume allowing payments to the website.[citation 
needed] DataCell had earlier[when?] said that suspension of payments towards 
WikiLeaks is a violation of the agreements with their customers. On July 
14, 2011 DataCell announced they had filed a complaint with the European 
Commission claiming the closure by Visa and MasterCard of Datcell‘s access 
to the payment card networks violated the competition rules of the European 
Community.[35] On July 12, 2012 a Reykjavík court ruled that Valitor, Visa 
and MasterCard's partner in Iceland, had to start processing donations 
within fourteen days[36] on pain of daily fines to the amount of ISK 800,000 
(some $6000) for each day after that time, to open the payment gateway. 
Valitor also had to pay DataCell's litigation costs of ISK 1,500,000.[37][38] 
In 2014, pursuant to an agreement between MasterCard and the Nigerian Government, 
acting through the National Identity Management Commission, the new Nigerian 
ID cards will bear MasterCard logo, contain personal database data and 
double as payment cards, irrevocably linking such payments to the individuals,[39] 
sparking criticism by the Civil Rights Congress alleging that it "represents 
a stamped ownership of a Nigerian by an American company ... reminiscent 
of the logo pasted on the bodies of African slaves transported across the 
Atlantic."[40] MasterCard, Comerica Bank, and the U.S. Treasury Department 
teamed up in 2008 to create the Direct Express Debit MasterCard prepaid 
debit card. The federal government uses the Express Debit product to issue 
electronic payments to people who do not have bank accounts, who are often 
referred to collectively as the “unbanked”. Comerica Bank is the issuing 
bank for the debit card. The Direct Express cards give recipients a number 
of consumer protections. In June 2013, MasterCard announced a partnership 
with British Airways to offer members the Executive Club Multi-currency 
Cash Passport, which will allow members to earn extra points and make multi-currency 
payments. The Passport card allows users to load up to ten currencies (euro, 
pound, U.S. dollar, Turkish Lira, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Canadian 
dollar, New Zealand dollar, U.A.E. dirham and South African rand) at a 
locked-in rate. When used, the card selects the local currency to ensure 
the best exchange rate, and if the local currency is not already loaded 
onto the card, funds are used from other currencies.[citation needed] MasterCard's 
current advertising campaign tagline is "Priceless". The slogan associated 
with the campaign is "There are some things money can't buy. For everything 
else, there's MasterCard." The Priceless campaign in more recent iterations 
has been applicable to both MasterCard's credit card and debit card products. 
They also use the Priceless description to promote products such as their 
"priceless travel" site which features deals and offers for MasterCard 
holders,[41] and "priceless cities", offers for people in specified locations.[42] 
The first of these Priceless ads was run during the 1997 World Series and 
there are numerous different TV, radio and print ads.[43] MasterCard registered 
Priceless as a trademark.[44] Actor Billy Crudup has been the voice in 
the US market; in the UK, actor Jack Davenport is the voice. The original 
idea and concept of the campaign stems from the advertising agency of McCann 
Erickson (as it was named in 1997).[45] The purpose of the campaign is 
to position MasterCard as a friendly credit card company with a sense of 
humor, as well as responding to the public's worry that everything is being 
commodified and that people are becoming too materialistic.[46] Many parodies 
have been made using this same pattern, especially on Comedy Central, though 
MasterCard has threatened legal action,[47] contending that MasterCard 
views such parodies as a violation of its rights under the federal and 
state trademark and unfair competition laws, under the federal and state 
anti-dilution laws, and under the Copyright Act. Despite these claims, 
however, noted US consumer advocate and presidential candidate Ralph Nader 
emerged victorious (after a four-year battle) in the suit MasterCard brought 
against him after he produced his own "Priceless" political commercials.[48] 
In the election ads Nader had criticized the corporate financing of both 
the Bush and Gore campaigns. Using the theme and some of the language behind 
the MasterCard "Priceless" campaign the election specified the dollar amounts 
contributed by corporate interests to both candidates and then summed it 
up with "finding out the truth ... priceless". MasterCard sued Nader's 
campaign committee and filed a temporary restraining order to stop the 
ads. The TRO was not granted and Nader defended the ads by claiming they 
were protected under the fair use doctrine.[49] In 1994 Argentinian born 
Edgardo Apestguia created in Paraguay an ad campaign for Bancard's credit 
card. Its slogan was "There are things money can't buy, but, for everything 
else, there is Bancard".[50] Plagiarism lawsuits were filed in Paraguay 
and Chile against MasterCard and their publicist Mc Cann, who registered 
the "priceless" slogan ads in the US in 1999 and was represented in Paraguay 
by Nafta and Biedermann publicists at the time. Through a partnership with 
an Internet company that specializes in personalized shopping, MasterCard 
introduced a Web shopping mall on April 16, 2010 that it said can pinpoint 
with considerable accuracy what its cardholders are likely to purchase.[51] 
MasterCard engages in the sponsorship of major sporting events throughout 
the world. These include the New Zealand All Blacks the country's rugby 
team,[52] Major League Baseball, the UEFA Champions League, the PGA Tour's 
Arnold Palmer Invitational Presented by MasterCard,[53] the Canadian Hockey 
League's Memorial Cup and recently announced a new sponsorship deal with 
Australian Cricket team. Previously it also sponsored FIFA World Cup but 
withdrew its contract after a court settlement and its rival Visa took 
up the contract in 2007.[54] In 1997, MasterCard was the main sponsor of 
the MasterCard Lola Formula One team, which withdrew from the 1997 Formula 
One season after its first race due to financial problems. MasterCard has 
its headquarters in the MasterCard International Global Headquarters in 
Purchase, New York.[55] The Global Operations Center is located in O'Fallon, 
Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Key executives include:[56][57] Prior 
to its IPO in 2006, MasterCard was an association that had a board of directors 
composed of banks. The current Board of Directors includes the following 
individuals: In June 2013, MasterCard has announced the promotion of Gilberto 
Caldart to head of Latin America and Caribbean division. Ann Cairns, the 
president of MasterCard’s international markets division, stated that she 
is certain that Gilberto, as the new regional head will continue to help 
customers grow their business, and provide MasterCard cardholders with 
innovative payment products and solutions. Caldart joined MasterCard from 
Citi Brazil in 2008, where he served as country business manager and oversaw 
the retail bank, consumer finance and cards business. He holds a bachelor's 
degree in business administration and accounting, as well as a master's 
degree from Duke University.[citation needed] MasterCard Contactless (formerly 
branded Paypass[58]) is an EMV-compatible, "contactless" payment feature 
similar to American Express' ExpressPay, and Visa payWave. All three use 
the same symbol as shown on the right. It is based on the ISO/IEC 14443 
standard that provides cardholders with a simpler way to pay by tapping 
a payment card or other payment device, such as a phone or key fob, on 
a point-of-sale terminal reader rather than swiping or inserting a card. 
PayPass can currently be used on transactions up to and including 30 GBP, 
25 EUR, 50 USD, 100 CAD, 200 NOK, 80 NZD, or 100 AUD. In 2003, MasterCard 
concluded a nine-month PayPass market trial in Orlando, Florida with JPMorgan 
Chase, Citibank, and MBNA. More than 16,000 cardholders and more than 60 
retailer locations participated in the market trial.[needs update] In addition, 
MasterCard worked with Nokia, AT&T Wireless, and JPMorgan Chase to incorporate 
MasterCard PayPass into mobile phones using near-field communication technology, 
in Dallas, Texas. In 2011, Google and MasterCard launched Google Wallet, 
an Android application which allows a mobile device to send credit/debit 
card information directly to a Paypass-enabled payment terminal, bypassing 
the need for a physical card, up until the creation of Android Pay. During 
late 2015, Citicards in the USA stopped issuing Paypass-enabled plastic, 
but the keyfob was still available upon request. Effective July 16, 2016, 
Citicards will stop supporting Paypass completely. While existing plastic 
and keyfobs will continue to work until their expiration date, no new Paypass-enabled 
hardware will be issued to US customers after that date. QkR is a mobile 
payment app developed by MasterCard, for the purpose of ordering products 
and services through a smartphone with payments charged to the associated 
credit card. It is being deployed for use in large scale events, such as 
sport events, concerts, or movie theaters. Unlike other MasterCard mobile 
payment apps such as Pay Pass, QkR does not use NFC from the phone, but 
rather an Internet connection. Users can open the app, scan a QR code located 
on the back of the seat in front of them, and place orders for refreshments 
of their choice.[59][60] The order is dispatched to a nearby concession 
stand, from where a runner delivers the items to the patrons' seats. It 
is already deployed in Australian movie theaters and is being tested in 
Yankee Stadium. QkR is being marketed to vendors as a replacement for other 
mobile payment apps and a mobile ordering app, either distributed by the 
vendor (such as Starbucks's app, McDonalds' app, or Chipotle's mobile ordering 
app) or by a third party, such as Square, headed by Twitter cofounder Jack 
Dorsey. MasterCard operates Banknet, a global telecommunications network 
linking all MasterCard card issuers, acquirers, and data processing centers 
into a single financial network. The operations hub is located in St. Louis, 
Missouri. Banknet uses the ISO 8583 protocol. MasterCard's network differs 
significantly from Visa's. Visa's is a star-based system where all endpoints 
terminate at one of several main data centers, where all transactions are 
processed centrally. MasterCard's network is an edge-based, peer-to-peer 
network where transactions travel a meshed network directly to other endpoints, 
without the need to travel to a single point. This allows MasterCard's 
network to be much more resilient, in that a single failure cannot isolate
