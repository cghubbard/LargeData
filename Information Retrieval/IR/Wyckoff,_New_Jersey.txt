Wyckoff is a township in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. As of 
the 2010 United States Census, the township's population was 16,696,[9][10][11] 
reflecting an increase of 188 (+1.1%) from the 16,508 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 1,136 (+7.4%) from the 15,372 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[20] As of the 2010 Census, Wyckoff ranked 55th in highest-income 
places in the United States with a population of at least 10,000 at $103,614 
HHI.[citation needed] Statewide, Wyckoff ranked 41st among New Jersey locations 
by per capita income, with a per capita money income of $49,375 as of 1999, 
an increase of 49.1% from the $33,124 recorded in 1989.[21] From the mid-18th 
century, what is now Wyckoff was a community within Franklin Township, 
formed on June 1, 1797, when Saddle River Township (now Saddle Brook) was 
split, which consisted of most of northern Bergen County west of the Saddle 
River. Starting in the 1840s, several new municipalities were created from 
portions of Franklin Township (Pompton Township on April 10, 1797, Hohokus 
Township (now Mahwah) on April 9, 1849, and Ridgewood Township on March 
30, 1876; remaining now the Village of Ridgewood), so that today what is 
now Wyckoff borders eight different communities. Wyckoff was formed as 
a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on November 2, 1926, 
replacing Franklin Township, based on the results of a referendum held 
that day. Portions of Wyckoff were ceded to Midland Park based on the results 
of a referendum held on June 9, 1931.[22] Though there is no solid historical 
evidence for any of the various theories, the most commonly given origin 
for the name Wyckoff, which was the origin accepted by the town committee 
when the town was established, is that the name is from the Lenape word 
wickoff, meaning "high ground", or that it is from wickok meaning "water".[23][24] 
However, similarly named Wyckoff Heights in New York City is named after 
the Wyckoff family, who settled in the New York/New Jersey area when both 
states were part of the Dutch colony of New Netherlands.[25] Other sources 
ascribe the name to Wicaugh in Malpas, England.[26] The first known human 
inhabitants of the area were the Lenni Lenape Native Americans who lived 
north of the Raritan River and spoke a Munsee dialect of Algonquian. Sicomac, 
said to mean "resting place for the departed" or "happy hunting ground", 
is an area of Wyckoff that, according to tradition, was the burial place 
of many Native Americans, including Chief Oratam of the Ackingshacys, and 
many stores and buildings in the community have been named after the area's 
name, including Sicomac Elementary School.[24] Most Native Americans had 
left by the 19th century, although a small group lived near Clinton Avenue 
until 1939. What is Wyckoff today was originally part of Saddle River Township, 
which included all of Bergen County west of the Saddle River. Saddle River 
Township was split in 1771, with the area containing Wyckoff becoming Franklin 
Township. By 1755, about 100 families lived in the Franklin Township area, 
of which no more than 20 were in what is now Wyckoff. Franklin Township 
(1771) consisted of what is today Ho-Ho-Kus (seceded 1849), Ridgewood (seceded 
1876), Midland Park (seceded 1894), Oakland (seceded 1902), Franklin Lakes 
(seceded 1922), and Wyckoff. The size of Franklin Township decreased as 
areas seceded and were incorporated into their own municipalities. After 
Franklin Lakes was established in 1922, Franklin Township consisted of 
only the area known locally as Wyckoff. On November 2, 1926, residents 
voted (243 positive votes out of 337) to change the name from Franklin 
Township to the Township of Wyckoff.[22] The first recorded permanent settlers 
were John and William Van Voor Haze (Voorhees), who purchased 550 acres 
(220 ha) of land in the area in 1720. Other early settlers (mostly Dutch) 
included the Van Horns, Terhunes, Ackermans, Quackenbushes, Pulises, and 
Vanderhoffs. In 1940 the population was just under 4,000 consisting of 
roughly 100 families with 30% of the land devoted to farming. By 1969 the 
number of farms had dropped to 13 covering 3 acres (1.2 ha), 6% of the 
township. By 2012, only two farms remain: Abma's Farm and Goffle Road Poultry 
Farm, which is Bergen County's only remaining live market.[27] Rail service 
by the New Jersey Midland Railway began in 1870. That service was purchased 
by the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway, which abruptly ended 
passenger service in 1966. The Terhune House is an historic home listed 
on the National Register of Historic Places, located at 161 Godwin Avenue, 
that was initially constructed in 1737.[28] In 1994, the Vander Plaat funeral 
home prepared the body of Richard Nixon for burial. According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 6.607 square miles 
(17.113 km2), including 6.547 square miles (16.957 km2) of land and 0.060 
square miles (0.156 km2) of water (0.91%).[2][3] Unincorporated communities, 
localities and place names located partially or completely within the township 
include Sicomac.[29] The climate in this area is characterized by hot, 
humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen 
Climate Classification system, Wyckoff has a humid subtropical climate, 
abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps.[30] At the 2010 United States Census,
