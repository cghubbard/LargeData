The 2000 Atlanta Braves season marked the franchise's 35th season in Atlanta. 
The Braves won their ninth consecutive division title, however, the 2000 
season would mark the first time since 1990 that the Braves did not appear 
in the National League Championship Series. One of the highlights of the 
season was that the All-Star Game was held at Turner Field in Atlanta. 
The 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played in Atlanta. It 
was the 71st midsummer classic featuring the American League (AL) and National 
League (NL). The game was played on July 11, 2000 at Turner Field. Five 
members of the Braves were part of the All-Star Game. Andr√©s Galarraga 
and Chipper Jones started at first base and third base, respectively. Tom 
Glavine, Greg Maddux and Andruw Jones were part of the team as well. The 
2000 All-Star Game was one of the few occurrences in which the manager 
of the host team also managed the home team of the game, in this case, 
the National League (Bobby Cox had led the Braves to the World Series the 
previous year earning the right to manage the National League). The final 
score was 6-3 for the American League. Infielders Other batters Manager
