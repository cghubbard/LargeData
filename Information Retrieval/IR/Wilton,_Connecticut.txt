Wilton is a town in Fairfield County in southwestern Connecticut in the 
United States.[3] As of the 2010 census, the town population was 18,062.[4] 
Officially recognized as a parish in 1726[citation needed], Wilton is today, 
like many other Fairfield County towns, an expensive residential community 
with open lands (a testament to its colonial farming roots), historic architecture 
and extensive town services. Residents commonly commute to New York City, 
Stamford, and Norwalk, although there are a number of office buildings 
in town.[citation needed] Wilton was rated one of CNN's top 25 towns to 
live, boasting an average household income of over $300,000 per family.[citation 
needed] Wilton is home to many successful start-up companies, national 
strategy and professional services and consulting firms, and global corporations 
such as ASML, Deloitte & Touche, Sun Products, Breitling USA, Cannondale 
Bicycle Corporation, Melissa & Doug, Clear Conscience Pet and the Blue 
Buffalo Company. Many Fortune 1000 companies are headquartered within a 
30-minute train or car commute. AIG Financial Products was headquartered 
in the town. Its trading in credit derivatives essentially bankrupted its 
parent company, AIG, and helped create the global financial crisis of 2008–2009.[5][6][7] 
For more information: History of Wilton, Connecticut The original 40 families 
of the parish began their own Congregational church and were allowed by 
Norwalk to hire a minister (Robert Sturgeon, who also became the town's 
first schoolmaster), open schools and build roads.[citation needed] During 
the Revolutionary War in 1777, the British used Wilton as an escape route 
after their successful raid on Danbury. Several homes were burned, but 
the town remained intact.[citation needed] In 1802, Wilton was granted 
a Town Charter by the Connecticut General Assembly and became a political 
entity independent from Norwalk.[citation needed] With a strong anti-slavery 
sentiment by its residents, Wilton served as a stop on the Underground 
Railroad.[citation needed] Wilton was classified as a "dry" town until 
1993, when the local ordinance was altered to permit the sale of alcoholic 
beverages in restaurants. The town was then referred to as "damp". On November 
5, 2009, a referendum proposal was passed to allow liquor stores. The town 
Board enacted an ordinance to allow liquor stores to sell alcoholic beverages 
in 2010, and several stores have since opened. According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 27.4 square miles (71 km2), 
of which 27.0 square miles (70 km2) is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2), 
or 1.50%, is water, including the South Norwalk Reservoir. Wilton is bordered 
by Ridgefield to the Northwest, Norwalk to the South, New Canaan to the 
Southwest, Westport to the Southeast, and Weston and Redding to the Northeast. 
It is also bordered on the west by the hamlet of Vista in Lewisboro, Westchester 
County, New York. The scenic Ridgefield Road offers a look at many historic 
homes, places, and sights. The latitude of Wilton is 41.201 N. The longitude 
is -73.438 W. Wilton has, by some estimates, more than 500 restored 18th- 
and 19th-century homes, although some old houses have been demolished. 
In 2005, Marilyn Gould—Wilton's second selectman and director of the Wilton 
Historical Society—told the New York Times, "People aren't taking down 
historic houses but the more modest homes that were built in the '50s and 
'60s," she said. "What that's doing is changing the affordability of the 
town and the demographic of the town. Wilton used to have a wide demographic 
of people who worked with their hands - artisans, builders, mechanics. 
Now its management and upper management."[8] Between 1999 and 2005, the 
town's voters endorsed spending $23 million through municipal bonds to 
preserve land.[8] South Norwalk Electric and Water (SNEW) has a reservoir 
on the western side of town with about 350 acres (1.4 km2) of land (along 
with another 25 acres (100,000 m2) adjacent in New Canaan). In the fall, 
hunters with bows and arrows—no more than 10 at a time—are allowed to hunt 
deer on the Wilton property in order to keep down the number of deer in 
the area.[9] Wilton's town center contains several local restaurants, boutiques, 
retail stores, a Starbucks, a Stop & Shop, and a four-screen movie theater 
owned by Bow-Tie Cinemas. These stores were added around 2000 next to the 
old Wilton Center, which consists of the Wilton Library, the Wilton Post 
Office, a CVS/Pharmacy, the Old Post Office Square, and the Village Market. 
In the southern part of town, US 7 contains a commercial section. Recent 
nature access developments in town include the expansion of the Norwalk 
River Valley Trail, a multi-use trail that is designed to eventually run 
between Norwalk and Danbury. The southwest corner of town includes part 
of the Silvermine neighborhood (which also extends into New Canaan and 
Norwalk). Georgetown, which is primarily in Redding and partly in Weston, 
extends a bit into the northeast corner of town. Other neighborhoods in 
town are South Wilton, Wilton Center, Gilbert Corners, Cannondale, and 
North Wilton. As of the census[12] of 2000, there were 17,633 people, 5,923
