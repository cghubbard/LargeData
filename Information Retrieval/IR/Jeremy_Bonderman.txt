Jeremy Allen Bonderman (born October 28, 1982) is an American former professional 
baseball pitcher. Bonderman is 6 ft 2 in (188 cm) tall and weighs 220 lb 
(100 kg) and bats and throws right-handed.[1] Bonderman attended Pasco 
High School in Pasco, Washington. In his last year of high school baseball, 
he went 5–2 and recorded a 3.60 earned run average (ERA). He is the only 
high school junior ever to be drafted with a first round pick in baseball 
history.[citation needed] Bonderman was drafted by the Oakland Athletics 
out of high school with the 26th pick in the 2001 Major League Baseball 
Draft, a selection that, according to Michael Lewis's Moneyball, caused 
Athletics general manager Billy Beane to throw a chair through a wall in 
fury.[2] On July 6, 2002, Bonderman was involved in a three team deal. 
The Athletics had sent Carlos Peña, a player to be named later (who later 
became Bonderman), and Franklyn Germán to the Detroit Tigers. The New York 
Yankees sent Ted Lilly, John-Ford Griffin, and Jason Arnold to the Athletics. 
The Tigers sent Jeff Weaver to the Yankees and cash to the Athletics. Bonderman 
debuted in the major leagues when he was 20 years old. His major league 
debut came against the Minnesota Twins, who scored six runs in four innings. 
In his first season, he had a 6–19 record. The next season, Bonderman went 
11–13 with a 4.89 ERA. In 2005, he had a 14–13 record and a 4.57 ERA. Bonderman 
was the Tigers Opening Day starter for the 2005 season. In 2006 Bonderman 
finished with a 14–8 record, his career best and posted a 4.08 ERA. He 
started game four of the 2006 American League Division Series against the 
Yankees. He pitched five perfect innings before giving up a hit. He then 
pitched 3 1⁄3 more innings, surrendering only one run. Bonderman was the 
winning pitcher in the game that gave the Tigers the series. He pitched 
again in game four of the 2006 American League Championship Series, pitching 
six innings and giving up three runs. The Tigers would go on to win the 
game and series for the American League Pennant. In the World Series, he 
pitched six innings giving up two runs. He left the game with the Tigers 
in the lead. However, the Tigers would ultimately lose the game, as well 
as the series the following day. In 2007, Bonderman had the best start 
of his career, but after the all-star break he struggled only winning four 
games, finishing 11–9 with a 5.01 ERA. He finished second in the 2007 All-Star 
Game Final vote.[3] Bonderman missed most of the 2008 season because he 
had procedures done to remove a blood clot in his axillary vein.[citation

Bonderman was placed on the disabled list indefinitely because of recurring 
pain in his pitching shoulder.[4] Bonderman started 29 games for the Tigers 
in 2010, going 8–10 with a 5.53 ERA. Following the season, he was granted 
free agency. The Plain Dealer reported that the Indians had interest in 
Bonderman, but for only a minor league contract. Bonderman remained unsigned 
through the 2011 season. On December 21, 2012, Bonderman signed a minor 
league contract with the Seattle Mariners. The deal included an invitation 
to spring training. He made his first start for the major league club on 
June 2, and took the loss in a 10–0 win by the Twins. On June 7, in his 
second start, he pitched three-hit ball for six innings to beat the New 
York Yankees and earn his first win since 2010.[5] He was designated for 
assignment on July 8, 2013, following consecutive poor starts.[6] On July 
14, 2013, Bonderman was signed to a minor league deal bringing him back 
to Detroit, playing for the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens.[7] On August 5, 2013, 
Bonderman was recalled from the Mud Hens, to join the Tigers bullpen.[8] 
In his first appearance back with Detroit, Bonderman pitched three innings 
of scoreless relief in the Tigers 6–5 victory over the Cleveland Indians, 
to earn his first career victory in relief. Bonderman throws four pitches, 
relying primarily on a two-seam fastball at 89–93 mph. His other pitches 
include a slider at 80–82 mph, a four-seam fastball at 89–92 mph, a changeup 
at 85–88 mph, and rarely a cutter at 86 mph.[9] Bonderman resides in Pasco, 
Washington with wife Amber and two children, Mailee Blaize (born June 1,
