Bryce Aron Max Harper (born October 16, 1992) is an American professional 
baseball right fielder for the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Harper was chosen by the Nationals with the first overall pick in 
the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft. Harper won the 2010 Golden Spikes 
Award, awarded annually to the best amateur baseball player.[1] Going into 
the 2012 season, baseball prospect-watchers, including Baseball America, 
MLB.com, and Baseball Prospectus routinely ranked Harper as a top-3 prospect. 
He made his MLB debut with the Nationals on April 28, 2012. Harper was 
selected for the 2012 All-Star Game, becoming the youngest position player 
to ever be selected.[2] He has been touted as a "five-tool player".[3][4] 
Harper won the NL Rookie of the Year Award in 2012. He tied for the NL 
lead in home runs in the 2015 Major League Baseball season, and was named 
the National League Most Valuable Player for 2015 by unanimous decision 
of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Harper attended Las Vegas 
High School. After his sophomore year, he earned his General Educational 
Development (GED) in October 2009, making him eligible for the June 2010 
amateur draft in order to begin his professional baseball career earlier.[5][6] 
For the 2010 college season, 17-year-old Harper enrolled at the College 
of Southern Nevada of the Scenic West Athletic Conference (SWAC) in the 
National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA), where he would play 
catcher. An advantage for Harper in his eventual transition to his professional 
career was that the SWAC, like MLB, uses wooden bats in conference play. 
In 66 games, he hit 31 home runs, 98 RBIs, hitting .443/.526/.987 (AVG/OBP/SLG).[7] 
His 31 home runs shattered the school's previous record of 12. He was named 
the 2010 SWAC Player of the Year.[7] In the Western district finals of 
the 2010 NJCAA World Series, Harper went 6-for-7 with 5 RBIs and hit for 
the cycle.[8] The next day, in a doubleheader, he went 2-for-5 with a three-run 
double in the first game, and in the second game went 6-for-6 with 4 home 
runs, a triple, and a double.[9] On June 2, 2010, Harper was ejected from 
a National Junior College World Series game by home plate umpire Don Gilmore 
after a called third strike. Harper drew a line in the dirt with his bat 
as he left the plate, presumably to show where he thought the pitch was. 
It was Harper's second ejection of the year, and resulted in a two-game 
suspension.[10] The suspension ended his amateur career, as Southern Nevada 
lost the game from which Harper was ejected and lost their next game with 
Harper suspended, which eliminated them from the tournament.[11] Harper 
won the 2010 Golden Spikes Award.[1] Harper was drafted No. 1 overall by 
the Washington Nationals in the 2010 MLB Draft,[12] making Harper the second 
consecutive number one overall pick of the Major League Baseball Draft 
taken by the Nationals. The Nationals took Stephen Strasburg in 2009.[13] 
Although Harper had previously and predominantly played catcher, the Nationals 
drafted him as an outfielder to extend his career and to accelerate his 
player development, so that he could debut in the MLB earlier. They also 
moved him because it preempted the demotion or benching of Wilson Ramos, 
a promising catcher.[12] Harper was represented by Scott Boras. Following 
in Strasburg's footsteps, Harper held out until the very last minute before 
the deadline. With twenty-six seconds remaining, Harper and the Nationals 
agreed to a 5-year contract worth $9.9 million, including a $6.25 million 
signing bonus, and eight semesters of college tuition.[14] When asked about 
the signing, Nationals President Stan Kasten said, "The truth is, with 
a full minute to go, Mike and I both thought we were not going to have 
a deal." Asked what changed in that final minute, Nationals General Manager 
Mike Rizzo replied, "It was both sides compromising and knowing that we 
were so close, it would be fruitless not to get a deal done."[15] On August 
26, 2010, Harper was introduced by the Nationals. Harper said he chose 
to wear No. 34 because "I always loved Mickey Mantle, three and four equals 
seven."[16] After batting .319 with a .407 OBP (and leading his team in 
hits, homers, RBIs and walks) in the Nationals' fall instructional league, 
Harper was selected to participate in the Arizona Fall League as a member 
of the Scottsdale Scorpions taxi-squad,[17] the second-youngest player 
in the history of the league (two days older than when Mets' prospect Fernando 
Martínez appeared in the league in 2006).[18] He batted .343 and slugged 
.729.[19] On November 20, Harper and the Scottsdale Scorpions won the 2010 
Arizona Fall League Championship. After batting .399 in spring training, 
the Nationals optioned Harper to the Hagerstown Suns of the Class-A South 
Atlantic League to begin his minor league career.[20] In April 2011, after 
a slow start in the minor leagues, Harper visited optometrist Dr. Keith 
Smithson, who reportedly told him, "I don't know how you ever hit before. 
You have some of the worst eyes I've ever seen." In his first 20 games 
after receiving contact lenses, Harper hit .480, collecting 7 home runs, 
10 doubles and 23 RBIs.[21] Harper was selected to represent the United 
States in the 2011 All-Star Futures Game during the 2011 All Star Game 
weekend. He was promoted to the Double-A Harrisburg Senators on July 4. 
Harper went 2 for 3 in his AA debut with two singles, a run, and a walk.[22] 
On August 18, 2011, Harper injured his hamstring while running from first 
to third base on an extra base hit. The injury was severe enough that he 
had to be carried off the field by his coaches. Harper was placed on the 
7-day disabled list, and it was reported that the injury had ended Harper's 
season.[23] During 2012 spring training, Harper was optioned to Triple-A 
Syracuse, where he started the season, playing exclusively at the center 
field position.[24] Harper was called up to the Nationals on April 27, 
2012 after Ryan Zimmerman was placed on the DL. He made his MLB debut with 
the Nationals the next day against the Los Angeles Dodgers.[25] Harper 
grounded out to the pitcher (Chad Billingsley) in his first Major League 
at bat. He recorded his first Major League hit with a double in his third 
at-bat against Billingsley and got his first RBI on a sacrifice fly in 
the top of the ninth against Javy Guerra.[26] After being hit by a pitch 
by Cole Hamels in the first inning of a game against the Phillies on May 
6, 2012, Harper eventually advanced to third, then stole home plate, becoming 
the first teenager to steal home plate since 1964.[27] Hamels later admitted 
to hitting Harper intentionally, and was suspended five games by MLB.[28] 
On May 14, 2012, Harper hit his first Major League home run off of San 
Diego Padres pitcher Tim Stauffer.[29] He was the youngest player to homer 
in the major leagues since Adrián Beltré did in 1998.[30] He was named 
National League Rookie of the Month for May.[31] Harper earned his first 
walkoff hit on June 5, 2012, with an RBI single in the bottom of the 12th 
inning against the New York Mets.[32] During a game against the Toronto 
Blue Jays on June 12, 2012, Harper hit a deep home run to center field 
that struck an advertising banner adjacent to the restaurant in the second 
tier of seats at the Rogers Centre,[33] estimated to travel 438 feet.[34] 
After the game, a reporter asked if Harper would take advantage of Ontario's 
lower drinking age (19, versus 21 in the U.S.) by drinking a celebratory 
beer with his teammates. Harper replied, "I'm not going to answer that. 
That's a clown question, bro." The comment quickly developed into an Internet 
meme,[35] and the phrase itself repeated, in response to a question, by 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.[36] Harper filed an application to trademark 
the phrase.[37] Harper was named a candidate in the All-Star Final Vote, 
with the winner being added to the All-Star Game roster. Harper finished 
third behind David Freese and Michael Bourn. However, Bourn would make 
the roster after Ian Desmond sustained an injury and Harper would become 
the youngest position player (and third-youngest player, behind Dwight 
Gooden and Bob Feller) to ever make an All-Star roster[2] when it was announced 
Giancarlo Stanton would undergo knee surgery.[38] "I don't have words to 
explain it right now. It's exciting to go. I'm excited to get there and 
be around all the top guys in the country, of course, and the top guys 
in baseball. I'm going to take it all in and try to enjoy it with my family 
and just be as mellow and as calm as I can be", Harper stated.[39] He went 
0-for-1 with a strikeout and a walk.[40][41] Harper struggled in the games 
following the All-Star break, hitting .176 with 26 strikeouts in his first 
116 plate appearances in the second half.[42] Manager Davey Johnson began 
to give Harper days off due to his poor play and visible on-field frustration.[43] 
Johnson said that Harper had become "overly aggressive" at the plate.[44] 
Harper's play began to improve in late August. He hit two home runs in 
a game against the Miami Marlins on August 29, 2012, his first career multi-homer 
game, and recorded his first major league ejection after throwing his helmet 
down in the ninth inning in response to hitting into a double play.[45] 
He had a second multi-homer game on September 5, 2012, against the Chicago 
Cubs.[44] Harper was named Rookie of the Month again in September after 
hitting .330 with seven home runs.[31] Harper's 254 total bases and 57 
extra base hits were the most ever for a player under age 20, while his 
22 home runs, 98 runs scored, .340 on-base percentage, .477 slugging percentage, 
and .817 on base-plus-slugging were the best regular season totals for 
a teenager in the past 45 years.[46] In Game 5 of the 2012 NLDS against 
the St. Louis Cardinals, Harper hit his first postseason home run. The 
Nationals would eventually lose the game 7–9 despite leading by 6 runs. 
He finished his first postseason appearance with a .130 batting average.[47] 
Harper was named the National League Rookie of the Year. He received 112 
votes, 16 of them first-place votes, beating Arizona's Wade Miley (105 
votes, 12 first-place) and Cincinnati's Todd Frazier.[48] Harper hit two 
home runs on Opening Day of the 2013 season vs the Miami Marlins. He became 
the youngest major league player, at age 20, to hit two home runs in his 
team's first game of the season. He was voted a starter for the MLB All 
Star Game, his second career All-Star selection.[49] After hitting 13 home 
runs in just 58 games, Harper was selected to participate in the 2013 Home 
Run Derby. Harper hit a total of 16 home runs in the first two rounds to 
advance to the final round, in which he faced Yoenis Cespedes, an outfielder 
for the Oakland Athletics. Although he lost 9–8 in the finals, Harper was 
the second-youngest player to participate in the Home Run Derby, and the 
youngest to ever make it to the final round. Harper hit his 17th homer 
of the season on August 6 and it was his 39th of his career, passing Ken 
Griffey Jr. for most home runs by a player younger than 21. Only 2 other 
players have more home runs than him before turning 21.[50][51] In 118 
games, he hit .274/.368/.486 with 20 HR, 58 RBI and 47 XBH. During the 
2013 off-season, Harper successfully underwent left knee surgery to remove 
a bursa sac. During a game against the San Diego Padres on April 25, 2014, 
Harper suffered a left thumb injury when sliding to 3rd base on a 3-run 
triple. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list the next day on April 
26. An MRI revealed that the thumb had a torn ulnar collateral ligament. 
On April 28, 2014, it was announced that Harper would require surgery to 
repair the ligament tear in the thumb. During a rehab game with the Double-A 
Harrisburg Senators on June 28, 2014, Harper hit 3 home runs in a single 
game. Harper returned to the Majors on June 30, 2014. In 100 games of 2014, 
Harper batted .273 with 13 home runs and 32 RBI. After the 2014 season, 
Harper would travel to Japan to participate in the 2014 Major League Baseball 
Japan All-Star Series,[52] but later withdrew.[53] On April 18, 2015, Harper 
hit the longest home run of his professional career with a 461-foot home 
run to center field against the Philadelphia Phillies.[54] On May 6, Harper 
hit three home runs in a single game for the first time in his career against 
Tom Koehler with one of the shots going 442 feet to the second deck in 
a 7–5 victory over the Miami Marlins, becoming the youngest player to accomplish 
this feat since Joe Lahoud in 1969.[55] Harper was later awarded the Player 
of the Month Award for the month of May for the first time in his career.[56] 
Measured by adjusted OPS (OPS+) Harper's 2015 was a top 5 hitting season 
(since 1900) for all players under the age of 23, and the best season of 
any hitter since Barry Bonds a decade earlier.[57] He also led the majors 
in WAR and tied for the NL home run title with 42.[58] Baseball America 
named Bryce the 2015 player of the year.[59] On October 31, Harper was 
named the National League winner of the 2015 Hank Aaron Award. On November 
19, Harper was selected as the 2015 National League Most Valuable Player 
by unanimous decision.[60] With his MVP win, Harper became the youngest 
player to unanimously win the MVP at age 23. Harper also became the first 
player in Nationals/Expos history to win an MVP award, and the first player 
that played for a Washington team to win one. ESPN chose him as their 2015 
MLB Person of the Year.[61] On April 14, 2016, Harper hit his first career 
grand slam for his 100th career home run in a game against the Atlanta 
Braves.[62] Three days later, he hit a home run for a fourth straight game, 
setting a new career streak for most consecutive games with a home run.[63] 
He was named National League Player of the Week on April 18, after driving 
in 12 runs, tying a club record for home runs in consecutive games and 
becoming the eighth-youngest player in major league history to reach 100 
home runs.[64] On May 8, 2016, Harper was walked six times in a game against 
the Chicago Cubs, tying the MLB record for most walks in a game.[65] Harper 
also reached base seven times (besides the six walks he was also hit by 
a pitch), becoming the first player in over 100 years to reach base seven 
times without recording an at bat.[66] In total, Harper was walked 13 times 
in the four-game series, setting a new MLB record for most walks in a series.[67] 
On May 9, 2016, Harper was ejected for yelling at Brian Knight from the 
dugout when Danny Espinosa was called out on strikes. Harper returned to 
the field to celebrate the win with his teammates and was caught shouting 
profanity towards Knight. Two days later, Harper was given a one-game suspension 
and an undisclosed fine, but Harper appealed the same day.[68] On May 14, 
Harper dropped his appeal, and began serving the one-game suspension. In 
147 games of 2016, Harper finished with a .243 batting average, 24 home 
runs, and 86 RBI. He also walked 108 times, and 20 of them were intentional 
that led MLB. The National finished the season with a 95-67 record, clinching 
the NL East division, but lost to the Dodgers in the 2016 NLDS. After the 
2016 season, the Nationals have Harper eligible for arbitration until 2018.[69] 
At the age of 26, Harper will become a free agent for the 2018-2019 season. 
It has been speculated that Harper may become the first player to sign 
a contract worth $400 million in sports history.[70] Harper has been known 
to stay in the dugout until the final out of All-Star Games, even though 
in that particular game, an exception permits that once the manager removes 
the starters from play they are not obligated to remain. Many promptly 
shower then leave the park. During each of his first four All-Star Games, 
Harper indicated that he had remained for the entire game, anticipating 
the opportunity to re-enter should his team require it due to a shortage 
of players by reason of either injury or ejection.[71] In junior high, 
Harper was a member of his school's basketball team. Harper's older brother, 
Bryan Harper, was a left-handed pitcher for College of Southern Nevada 
with Bryce. Bryan played for the University of South Carolina Gamecocks, 
back to back winners of the 2010 and 2011 College World Series. Bryan was 
also selected in the 2010 MLB Draft, by the Chicago Cubs.[74][75] He did 
not sign and then was drafted in the 2011 MLB Draft by the Washington Nationals. 
Harper was featured in an episode of ESPN E:60[76] and was on the cover 
of Sports Illustrated in May 2009.[77] Harper featured in another ESPN 
magazine in 2015, this time displaying naked in ESPN's The Magazine 2015 
Body Issue.[78] Harper also received a sponsorship deal with a nutritional 
supplement company focusing on active lifestyles, MusclePharm.[79] Harper's 
father, Ron, is an ironworker in Las Vegas. Harper attributes his work 
ethic to the lessons he learned from watching his father: "I wanted to 
come out and I wanted to work hard because he worked hard. He did it for 
over 25 years."[80] Harper is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints.[81] Harper owns a customized Mercedes-Benz CLS, outfitted 
with a low-light glow bat enclosure in the trunk and Nationals curly "W" 
insignia on the rear of the car replacing the Mercedes logo.[82] Bryce 
Harper was one of four nominees up for the 2016 ESPY Award, male athlete 
of the year, won by Lebron James. In May 2014, Harper proposed[83] to his 
longtime girlfriend Kayla Varner. Their wedding set for January 2015 did 
not take place.[84] In July 2016, Varner announced[85] the couple's reconciliation,
