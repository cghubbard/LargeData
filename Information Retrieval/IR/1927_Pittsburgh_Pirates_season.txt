The 1927 Pittsburgh Pirates season was a season in American baseball. That 
year, the Pirates won the National League pennant, which was their second 
in three years and their last until 1960. The team included five future 
Hall of Famers: Paul Waner, Lloyd Waner, Pie Traynor, Kiki Cuyler, and 
20-year-old rookie Joe Cronin (who played just 12 games). In the World 
Series, however, Pittsburgh was no match for the New York Yankees. They 
were swept in four games. Paul Waner had one of his best seasons en route 
to being voted NL MVP. His .380 batting average and 131 RBI paced the entire 
circuit. Younger brother Lloyd and Traynor finished third and fifth in 
the batting race, respectively. Pitcher Ray Kremer won the ERA title on 
his way to a 19â€“8 record. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Note:
