The Chicago Pirates were a baseball team in the Players' League for a single 
season in 1890. The team played their home games at South Side Park (II). 
Their powerful National League rivals were the Chicago White Stockings 
which later became the Cubs. The Pirates recruited most of the White Stocking's 
players, and for this reason the Pirate's attendance was nearly fifty percent 
higher than the White Stockings. The Pirate's owner, John Addison, was 
a wealthy contractor. Although Addison and his partner White Stocking second 
baseman Fred Pfeffer had signed mostly White Stocking players, they also 
signed four players from the St. Louis Browns of the American Association 
as well as a pitcher from the Columbus Solons of the American Association.[1] 
The team was managed by Charles Comiskey. Comiskey and Duffy are members 
of the Baseball Hall of Fame. On June 21, 1890, Silver King pitched the 
only ever Player's League no-hitter. The team had two nicknames: 1) White 
Stockings - player wore white hose - which was appropriate because this 
PL franchise signed away many NL Chicago White Stocking players, 2) Pirates 
- name applied not for "pirating" away NL players but rather because the 
team "pirated" many victories with late inning comebacks in games in which 
they trailed early. Source: BASEBALL TEAM NAMES 1869-2012, Rick Worth.
