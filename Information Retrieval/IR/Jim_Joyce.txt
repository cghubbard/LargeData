James Alfred "Jim" Joyce III (born October 3, 1955) is an American pro 
baseball umpire. He has worked in the American League (AL) from 1987 to 
1999 and throughout Major League Baseball (MLB) since 2000. He wears uniform 
number 66 (he wore uniform number 6 while in the AL). His strike call is 
extremely loud and enthusiastic, similar to that of retired umpire Bruce 
Froemming. He became infamous for Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game 
in June 2010. Prior to this, an ESPN The Magazine poll of MLB players called 
Joyce the best umpire in the game. He also called an obstruction rule in 
the bottom of the ninth in Game 3 of the 2013 World Series that helped 
the St. Louis Cardinals to a win over the Boston Red Sox. In 2012, Joyce 
was promoted to interim crew chief, replacing injured umpire John Hirschbeck. 
His crew consisted of Jim Reynolds, Mike DiMuro, and James Hoye. Joyce 
was promoted to regular crew chief prior to the 2013 season.[1] Joyce was 
born in Toledo, Ohio, on October 3, 1955. He grew up in Toledo, where he 
graduated from Central Catholic High School in 1973.[2] He then attended 
Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, where he played 
baseball.[2] In 1977, he graduated from Bowling Green with a bachelor of 
science degree in education.[2] After graduating from Bowling Green State 
University in 1977, he umpired in the Midwest League (1978–1979), the Florida 
Instructional League (1978), the Texas League (1980), the Pacific Coast 
League (1981–1986, 1988), the International League (1987), and the Dominican 
League (1983). In 1989, Joyce was promoted from the Pacific Coast League 
to the American League upon the death of MLB umpire Nick Bremigan.[3] Joyce 
has umpired in the All-Star Game (1994, 2001, and 2012),[citation needed] 
the Division Series (1995, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2012, 
and 2013),[citation needed] the League Championship Series (1997, 2004, 
2006, and 2007),[citation needed] and the World Series (1999, 2001, and 
2013).[4] ESPN The Magazine released an anonymous poll of 100 current MLB 
players that voted Joyce the best overall umpire in baseball. For the 2012 
season, Joyce served as an interim crew chief due to the absence of the 
injured John Hirschbeck.[5] On August 20, 2012, Joyce saved the life of 
an Arizona Diamondbacks employee by administering CPR to the woman who 
was in cardiac arrest at Chase Field.[6] On June 2, 2010, Joyce made an 
incorrect call, as the first base umpire, which cost Armando Galarraga 
a perfect game. Joyce tearfully spoke with the media following the game 
and admitted he made a mistake: "I just cost the kid a perfect game".[7] 
Joyce and Galarraga received praise throughout the sports world for the 
manner in which they handled the situation; reflecting an earlier ESPN 
poll, players such as Mariano Rivera spoke on the record about Joyce's 
superb career of umpiring.[citation needed] In 2011, Joyce, Galarraga, 
and author Daniel Paisner collaborated on a book based on the game, Nobody's 
Perfect: Two Men, One Call, and a Game for Baseball History. Due to the 
book's release, MLB has not allowed Joyce to work any games in which Galarraga 
would be playing to avoid any appearance of impropriety due to their business 
relationship.[8] Coincidentally, Joyce had been on the crew for Dallas 
Braden's perfect game less than a month earlier.[9] Not only was Joyce 
the first-base umpire for Galarraga's game, he was also the first-base 
umpire for the no-hitter pitched by Carlos Zambrano on September 14, 2008.[10] 
In September 1996, Joyce restrained fellow umpire John Hirschbeck when 
Hirschbeck angrily charged into the Baltimore Orioles clubhouse to confront 
Roberto Alomar. The day before the confrontation, Alomar had made comments 
about how Hirschbeck's attitude changed following the death of his son.[11] 
Working third base during Game 3 of the 2013 World Series, Joyce determined 
Allen Craig of the St. Louis Cardinals had been obstructed when Boston 
Red Sox infielder Will Middlebrooks went diving after an errant throw by 
catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia.[12] Craig was then awarded the winning run 
when home plate umpire Dana DeMuth enforced the obstruction called by Joyce. 
On September 8, 2016 in a game between the Houston Astros and the Cleveland 
Indians, Lonnie Chisenhall was batting with the bases loaded while the 
Indians were leading 2-1. Astros' pitcher David Paulino threw a pitch that 
touched Chisenhall's bat which went to the backstop. Francisco Lindor scored 
on what was ruled a wild pitch by Joyce while Mike Napoli scored as well 
when Astros' catcher Jason Castro was attempting to call for time. After 
an umpire meeting, Joyce ruled that the ball was a wild pitch instead of 
a foul ball and that the two runs were allowed to count. Astros' manager, 
AJ Hinch was then ejected for arguing with Joyce on the call as the Indians 
won the game 10-7. In 2009, Joyce was inducted into the Irish American 
Baseball Hall of Fame. Joyce, who lives in Washington County, Oregon, is 
married and has two children.[13] In 2000, he was inducted into his high
