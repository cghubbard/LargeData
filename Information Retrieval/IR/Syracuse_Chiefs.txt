The Syracuse Chiefs are a Minor League Baseball team based in Syracuse, 
New York. The Triple-A affiliate of the Washington Nationals, the team 
plays in the International League (IL). NBT Bank Stadium, on Syracuse's 
northside, is the Chiefs' home stadium. The first Syracuse Chiefs baseball 
team was established in 1934, when the International League's Jersey City 
Skeeters moved to Syracuse and were (re)named the Chiefs. The team played 
in the IL through 1955 (winning five championships), but was sold and moved 
to Miami as the Marlins for the 1956 campaign. Another team known as the 
Syracuse Chiefs competed in the Class A Eastern League (then two levels 
below the IL) during 1956–57, but moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania on July 
13, 1957.[5] Syracuse was without professional baseball until the 1961 
season, when the Montreal Royals franchise was abandoned by its owners 
(the Los Angeles Dodgers) and relocated to Syracuse, becoming the Syracuse 
Chiefs. The Chiefs have played in Syracuse without interruption since their 
rebirth in 1961. The team was renamed the SkyChiefs in 1997. The name reverted 
to the original "Chiefs" in December 2006.[6] From 1978 to 2008, the Chiefs 
were the Triple-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays. The three-decade 
Toronto–Syracuse affiliation is the longest of the 11 major league affiliations 
the Chiefs have had since 1936. The Chiefs played at MacArthur Stadium 
from 1934 to 1996, moving to then-P&C Stadium in 1997. On September 20, 
2008 the Chiefs signed a two-year affiliation agreement with the Washington 
Nationals, ending their relationship with the Blue Jays. That season the 
players wore a decal on their uniforms with the letters "HB" to commemorate 
Harold Berman, former member of the team's board of directors, who died 
after the 2007 season. In 2009 the Chiefs wore a decal on their uniforms 
with the letters "HM" to commemorate Hy Miller, former state assemblyman 
and former member of the team's board of directors, who died after the 
2008 season. In 2010 the Chiefs celebrated their 50th season of community-owned 
baseball (1961–2010), wearing 1961 jerseys for every Thursday home game. 
The team brought back radio announcers from the past, such as Dan Hoard 
and Syracuse University alumnus Sean McDonough. They had a 76–67 won-lost 
record, with pitching prospect Stephen Strasburg winning two game and losing 
one in five appearances. In 2011 the Chiefs, playing their 51st season 
of community ownership, wore throwback jerseys for every Thursday home 
game to commemorate the 35th anniversary of their last International League 
Governors' Cup championship team (managed by Syracuse Wall of Fame member 
Bobby Cox). The Chiefs added four alternate jerseys to their rotation for 
the season: one for Latin American Day, a second for Jackie Robinson Day 
(commemorating Negro League uniforms), a third for national holidays such 
as Independence Day and Memorial Day and a fourth for Breast Cancer Awareness 
Night. The team played the Pawtucket Red Sox on August 20 at Fenway Park 
as part of a doubleheader in conjunction with the sixth annual Futures 
at Fenway event, featuring games involving Boston Red Sox minor-league 
teams. The Chiefs, behind starter Brad Meyers, defeated the PawSox 3–1 
before more than 29,000 fans. At Alliance Bank Stadium (now NBT Bank Stadium) 
the Chiefs added a "Home Plate Club" to the stadium: premium seating in 
the first four rows behind home plate, with waitstaff for merchandise, 
food and drink. On May 14 Chiefs DH Michael Aubrey went four for four, 
hitting four home runs in an 11–0 victory over the Durham Bulls and becoming 
the second player in team history to hit four home runs in a game; Gene 
Locklear was the first, on July 14, 1977. On August 27 Stephen Strasburg 
pitched his only rehab game for the Chiefs, against the Rochester Red Wings. 
Giving up two hits in the sixth inning (his only hits allowed before departing, 
with the Chiefs leading 1–0), he received no decision in Syracuse's 4–3 
win (which won the Thruway Cup for the third time; the team's other wins 
were in 1999 and 2010). The club's record for the season was 66–74, 14 
games out of first place and fourth place in the six-team North Division. 
On April 5, 2012, the Chiefs opened at home against the Rochester Red Wings. 
Top pick Bryce Harper, since promoted to the Nationals, made the opening-day 
roster. Randy Knorr did not return for a second season as manager, and 
Tony Beasley was promoted from the Harrisburg Senators. The Chiefs played 
all 16 of its games against the Scranton/Wilkes Barre Yankees at Alliance 
Bank Stadium due to stadium renovation in Moosic, Pennsylvania. On May 
7 the Chiefs unveiled a new high-definition video board in left field, 
replacing the board which had existed since the stadium's 1997 opening. 
The 2013 season, with manager Tony Beasley in his second season with the 
team, began on April 4 in Allentown, Pennsylvania against the Lehigh Valley 
IronPigs; the Chiefs' home opener was eight days later against the IronPigs. 
On Throwback Thursdays, the team wore jerseys from 1983 to 1996. On September 
30, 2013, it was announced that 16-year general manager John Simone and 
any family members associated with the team (including assistant GM Mike 
Vounitas) were fired. On October 8 it was announced that former Auburn 
Doubledays general manager Jason Smorol would become the Chiefs' GM, with 
Jason Horbal his assistant. It was the first time since 1970 that someone 
not named Simone was general manager of Syracuse; John Simone had taken 
over the job from his father, Anthony (Tex) Simone, in 1997. The Chiefs 
opened their 2014 season on April 3 with a loss at home to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
RailRiders and finished the season with the best record (81-62) in the 
International League and clinched a playoff spot for the first time since 
1998 and the first IL North Division title since 1989. NBT Bank Stadium 
hosted its first ever playoff game on September 5, 2014, a 7-6 loss to 
the Pawtucket Red Sox which capped off a 3-0 first round series sweep for 
the Red Sox. The season featured an aggressive promotional campaign, including 
Social Media Monday, Two-for-One Tickets on Tuesday, Winning Wednesday, 
Dollar Thursday, Fireworks Friday, Giveaway Saturday and Family Sunday. 
The Chiefs sold out the outfield wall, the dugouts and the field tarp, 
earning $500,000 in advertising. On July 1 the Chiefs introduced Tattoo 
Night, sponsored by Carmelo's Ink City. The 2015 season saw the Chiefs 
finish in 4th place in the 6 team IL North division with a record of 66-78. 
The Chiefs early season struggles including a 11-game losing streak extending 
from May to June hurt the Chiefs too much to rebound despite going 39-26 
after July 1 including an 11-game win streak in Mid July. Billy Gardner 
Jr. managed the Chiefs in his second season with the team. Stephen Strasburg 
went 1-1 with the Chiefs in two rehab starts. In the two games Strasburg 
pitched 9.2 innings with an ERA of 4.66. The team's best pitcher by record 
was Bruce Billings who went 8-5 in 27 games. The best pitcher by ERA with 
more than 25 innings pitched was Evan Meek who had an ERA of 2.15 in 30 
games, with a record of 2-4. The Chiefs player with the most hits in 2016 
was Darin Mastroianni with 114 hits. The Chiefs player with the best average 
with over 100 At Bats was Trea Turner, with an AVG of .314 in 188 at bats, 
including 3 home runs, 7 doubles and 15 RBI. Pitchers Catchers Infielders

are owned by the Community Baseball Club of Central New York, Inc., "a 
community-owned club, controlled by a [13-person] board of directors,"[2][7][8][9] 
acting on behalf of approximately 4,000 shareholders, who together hold 
15,857 shares.[9] According to Dick Ryan, a "former club chairman of the 
board and treasurer", a majority of the shares "are owned by people who 
own one or two shares."[7] Shares in the club were first sold in 1961, 
at a price of $10 each; as of 2011, shares had a resale value of approximately 
$126, but are not publicly traded. A provision in the Chief's certificate 
of corporation states that "no one may vote more than 500 shares."[7] This 
provision is intended to make it difficult for the club to be sold and 
moved to another location, as happened earlier in its history.[7] Current 
officers of the Syracuse Chiefs/ Community Baseball Club of Central New 
York, Inc., include: Among those serving on the organization's Board of 
Directors are Stephen A. Rogers, Chairman, Syracuse Media Group;[8] and 
Crandall Melvin III, "a software executive from Syracuse and the team's 
largest single shareholder with 502 shares."[9] Dutch is a partner in Chiefs 
First LLC, an investment company established in September 2013, which loaned 
the Chiefs $500,000 in return for 600 shares and control of the team's 
new, 13-member board.[10] The Chiefs have been operating at a loss since 
2006, except for the 2010 season when they ended the season $100,000 in 
the black. The team lost $973,516 in the 2013 season, on operating expenses 
of $3.1 million.[11][12] Under new general manager Jason Smorol, their 
losses were reduced to $241,584 in 2014, and $169,011 in 2015.[13] * Includes

Grilli, Syracuse Wall of Fame member and former Major Leaguer. All games 
against thruway rivals Rochester or Buffalo are broadcast on TWCS and fed

in The Simpsons episode Dancin' Homer on experiences as an announcer for 
the Syracuse Chiefs. The episode includes references to former announcer 
Dan Hoard and owner Anthony "Tex" Simone (named Antoine "Tex" O'Hara in 
the episode). The Chiefs gained national media attention for a promotion 
planned for 2014's Tattoo Appreciation Night, where anyone who got a tattoo 
of their "C" logo would receive free tickets to Chiefs games for life.[20]
