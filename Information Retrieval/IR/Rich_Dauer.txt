As player As coach Richard Fremont Dauer (born July 27, 1952), is a former 
Major League Baseball (MLB) player, an infielder with the Baltimore Orioles 
from 1976 to 1985. He played in two World Series with the Orioles, in 1979 
and 1983. Primarily a second baseman in the majors, he also played third 
base and is currently the first base coach for the Houston Astros. Born 
in San Bernardino, California, Dauer graduated from Colton High School 
in 1970 and played college baseball for the Indians of San Bernardino Valley 
College. He transferred to the University of Southern California in Los 
Angeles, where he was an All-American[1][2] at third base and helped the 
Trojans win the College World Series in 1973 and 1974,[3] USC's fifth consecutive 
title and sixth in seven years.[4][5][6] Selected in the first round of 
the 1974 MLB draft in early June, Dauer was the 24th overall pick and began 
his pro career in the Single-A South Atlantic League with the Asheville 
Tourists. He moved up to the Rochester Red Wings of the Triple-A International 
League late in the 1975 season. The following season with Rochester, Dauer 
won the league batting title with a .336 average.[7] He was called up by 
the Orioles that year but struggled, getting only four hits in 39 at bats.[8] 
Dauer's struggles continued at the start of 1977, as he had just one hit 
in his first 41 at bats. He began the year as the Orioles' starting second 
baseman but soon lost the role to Billy Smith.[9] He credited Brooks Robinson 
and Lee May with helping him out, saying, "You can't make it in the Majors 
by yourself."[8] By the end of the year, he had regained the second base 
job from Smith.[9] He batted .243 with 74 hits, 15 doubles, five home runs, 
and 25 RBI in 96 games while compiling a .982 fielding percentage at second 
base.[10] Dauer played in the 1979 postseason, and Orioles defeated the 
California Angels in four games in the best-of-five 1979 American League 
Championship Series to secure the pennant, Baltimore's first since 1971. 
In the World Series, the O's built 3-1 lead, but lost the last three games 
to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He also played in the World Series in 1983, 
also known as the "The I-95 Series," won by the Orioles over the Philadelphia 
Phillies in five games. Dauer holds two American League single season fielding 
records for a second baseman, including 86 consecutive errorless games 
and 425 straight errorless chances, both set in 1978.[11] Dauer is one 
of the few to have won a College World Series and an MLB World Series.[3] 
In addition, he is also one of the few players to have participated in 
an MLB World Series as both a player and as a coach. In 2012, Dauer was 
inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame, becoming the 12th member 
of the 1983 championship team to be inducted.[11] Dauer also has worked 
as a minor league coach for five organizations, and managed the Dodgers' 
Class A San Bernardino Spirit affiliate in 1987.[12] At the major league 
level, he coached for the Cleveland Indians, Kansas City Royals, Milwaukee 
Brewers and Colorado Rockies.[3][13] On December 19, 2012, he was named 
Manager of the Padres' Class AA affiliate, the San Antonio Missions.[13] 
Former teammate Lenn Sakata credited Dauer with helping him at shortstop 
in 1981 and 1982. "While I was at short, Rich gave me all the help and 
encouragement I needed. He was one of the best."[14] Rosenfeld, Harvey
