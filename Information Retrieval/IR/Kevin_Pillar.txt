Kevin Andrew Pillar (/pᵻˈlɑːr/) (born January 4, 1989) is an American professional 
baseball center fielder for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Pillar was an All-American center fielder in college. He set the 
NCAA Division II record with a 54-game hitting streak in 2010, and established 
his school's all-time record with a career batting average of .367. Pillar 
was drafted by the Blue Jays in the 32nd round (979th overall) of the 2011 
Major League Baseball draft. In 2011 he batted .347, winning the Appalachian 
League batting title in his first minor league season. In 2012 Pillar batted 
.323, while stealing 51 bases, and was named the Midwest League MVP. He 
made his major league debut for the Blue Jays in August 2013. In December 
2013, Baseball America identified him as the "Best Hitter for Average" 
among Blue Jays' prospects. In 2014, he led the International League in 
doubles while batting .323, and was named an IL post-season All Star. In 
his minor league career through 2014, he batted .322. Pillar, who is Jewish, 
was born in the Los Angeles district of West Hills to Mike and Wendy Pillar.[1][2][3][4] 
His mother is Jewish and his father is Christian; Pillar had a Bar Mitzvah.[2][5] 
His nickname is K.P.[6] In high school at Chaminade College Prep, Pillar 
played in the outfield for the baseball team. He also played on offense, 
defense, and special teams with the football team, as well as point guard 
on the basketball team, and earned first-team all-league honors in each 
sport.[1][7][8] In baseball, he batted just under .400 for his high school 
career, with a high of .463 in his senior year.[7] Pillar attended California 
State University, Dominguez Hills, in Carson, California.[9] There, he 
majored in mathematics and business, and played center field for the Toros 
baseball team, for which he was an All-American.[3][5][7][9][10][11] As 
a freshman in 2008 he hit .379, the fifth-highest average in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association (as he was also third in the league with 
20 doubles, and fifth in the league with 17 steals), and was named to the 
All-CCAA 2nd team.[7][12] As a sophomore in 2009 he batted .329 and was 
again named a 2nd-Team All-CCAA selection, while stealing 18 bases in 19 
attempts.[7] In 2010, as a junior he set an NCAA Division II record at 
the school, with a 54-game hitting streak, five games more than the prior 
record.[1][7][13] During Pillar's streak he came to the plate eight times 
needing a hit in his final at bat, and got one.[14] Batting .379 for the 
season, he was also named a Rawlings/ABCA National Gold Glove Award winner, 
ESPN the Magazine/CoSIDA Academic 1st-team All-District, an Honorable Mention 
All-American by NCBWA, 1st-team Daktronics/NCAA, NCBWA and Rawlings/ABCA 
All-West Region, and 1st-team All-CCAA selection, giving him three All-CCAA 
honors in three years.[15] In his senior year, he batted .369 with a 1.000 
fielding percentage.[16][17] Pillar finished his college career as the 
school's all-time batting leader, with a .367 average.[13] Pillar was drafted 
by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 32nd round (979th overall) of the 2011 
Major League Baseball Draft.[18][19] His signing bonus of $1,000 was so 
little, after taxes, that he needed to ask his Mom for some additional 
money so that he could have enough to buy an iPhone.[20] When he was promoted 
to the majors two years later, Blue Jays general manager Alex Anthopoulos 
said: "Clearly ... and I say that respectfully, we got him wrong. Just 
because, if he has a chance to get to the big leagues, you don't wait for 
the [32nd] round to select him."[11] Pillar played for the Bluefield Blue 
Jays in 2011, and batted .347 over 60 games, winning the Appalachian League 
batting title and leading the organization in batting average.[21][22] 
He was named an Appalachian League All-Star.[23][24] He holds the team's 
all-time records for batting average, on-base percentage (.377), and slugging 
percentage (.534).[25] He was then called up to play for the Vancouver 
Canadians in its playoff run, and batted .391 to help the team win the 
Northwest League title.[24] Pillar began the 2012 minor league season with 
the Single-A Lansing Lugnuts of the Midwest League, where he recorded a 
.322 batting average and stole 35 bases in 86 games. He was then promoted 
to the Advanced-A Dunedin Blue Jays, where he batted .323 and stole 16 
bases, in 42 games. His total of 51 steals in 2012 was the second-most 
in the Blue Jays organization, and 10th-most in the minor leagues.[23][26] 
Considered an excellent defensive player, he played all three outfield 
positions.[26] He was named the 2012 Midwest League Most Valuable Player, 
after also garnering mid-season and post-season All Star honors, and being 
named the best hitting prospect in the Midwest League by Baseball America.[23][27][28] 
He was also named a Topps Class A All Star and an MiLB.com Organization 
All Star.[23] He then played for the Salt River Rafters in the Arizona 
Fall League, batting a team-leading .371.[26][29][30] Pillar was promoted 
to the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats before the start of the 2013 
minor league season. He played 71 games for the team, and made 12 outfield 
assists.[31] He was considered one of the most consistent hitters and defenders 
in the Eastern League, "with great instincts, a powerful and accurate throwing 
arm," and showed speed on the base paths.[4] Richie Hebner, his hitting 
coach, said: "He is the best player in the league. He does everything well."[32] 
He batted .313 with 5 home runs and 30 RBIs, and was leading the Eastern 
League with 95 hits, before being promoted to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons.[23] 
Through his first 11 games, Pillar batted .391 and had more doubles (8) 
than singles (7).[33] During his time in Buffalo he had more extra-base 
hits (27) than any other player in AAA over that timespan.[34] In 123 games 
between New Hampshire and Buffalo, he had 39 doubles and 155 hits which, 
at the time of his August 2013 promotion, were the second- and third-highest 
totals, respectively, in the minor leagues.[35] Buffalo manager Marty Brown 
said: "I am impressed with how he has swung the bat, for sure. But he also 
always seems to be in the right place at the right time defensively. He's 
a very heads-up baserunner."[36] Pillar was ranked the 16th-best prospect 
in the Blue Jays organization by MLB.com in July 2013.[19] Pillar had not 
previously ranked in the top 20 on MLB.com's rankings.[37] Baseball America 
ranked him as the team's 12th-best prospect.[35] In 2013, his 155 hits 
in the minors led the organization for the second consecutive year.[31] 
In December 2013, Baseball America designated him the "Best Hitter for 
Average" among the Blue Jays' prospects.[38] In 2014 with the Bisons he 
batted .323 (3rd in the league) in 100 games (missing 35 games during his 
two call-ups to the majors), leading the International League in doubles 
(39; second-most in the Bisons' modern era to Jhonny Peralta's 44 in 2004), 
4th in extra-base hits (52), and 5th in slugging percentage (.509), with 
10 home runs, 59 RBIs, and 27 stolen bases.[3][39][40] Pillar had both 
a 21-game hitting streak (the longest in the league for the season) and 
an 18-game hitting streak, making him the first player in Buffalo's modern 
era to put together two hitting streaks of 18 games or more.[39][40] He 
was named International Player of the Week twice (on May 5 and August 6), 
an International League post-season All-Star, and the 2014 Buffalo Bisons 
MVP.[41][42] In his minor league career through 2014, Pillar batted .322 
with a slugging percentage of .477 and an OPS of .841 in 411 games.[2][20][43][44] 
Pillar was called up to the Blue Jays for the first time in his career 
on August 14, 2013, after center fielder Colby Rasmus was placed on the 
15-day disabled list and utility player Emilio Bonifacio was traded to 
the Kansas City Royals.[45][46] He was the first member of Toronto's 2011 
draft to reach the majors, and as of April 2015, was the lowest selection 
of his major league draft class to get to the majors.[47][48] General manager 
Anthopoulos stated that, at the time of his call-up, he considered Pillar 
a "legit center option".[49] Pillar made his major league debut that night 
against the Boston Red Sox. He was given uniform number 22, which was formerly 
worn by pitcher Jimmy Key, among others.[50] He was 0-for-4 with one strikeout, 
and made a superb, head-long, diving catch in the outfield in the Blue 
Jays' 4–3 extra innings win.[48][51] Pillar recorded his first career hit 
and RBI in a doubleheader against the New York Yankees on August 20. On 
August 24, Pillar hit his first career home run, a three-run shot off Houston 
Astros starter Brad Peacock.[52] In 2014, after starting the season with 
the Blue Jays, Pillar was optioned to the Buffalo Bisons on March 22.[53] 
He was called up to the Blue Jays on May 13, after Jonathan Diaz was optioned 
to Triple-A. Pillar had reached base safely in a league-high 26 straight 
games with Buffalo, and posted a triple slash of .305/.344/.461 in 34 games, 
while leading the league in doubles and leading Triple-A with an 18-game 
hitting streak.[54][55] On June 9, Pillar hit a walk-off single, scoring 
Erik Kratz to give the Blue Jays a 5–4 win over the Minnesota Twins.[56] 
On June 24 he was sent back down to Buffalo for throwing his bat after 
manager John Gibbons removed him for pinch hitter Anthony Gose.[57] He 
was recalled on August 26 when Nolan Reimold was designated for assignment.[58] 
In the 2015 offseason, the Blue Jays acquired Michael Saunders from the 
Seattle Mariners, and Pillar was expected to compete for the fourth outfielder 
role heading into spring training. However, he stepped in as the starting 
left fielder after Saunders tore his meniscus before the start of spring 
training. Throughout the season, Pillar made several highlight reel catches, 
including robbing Tim Beckham of a home run on April 15.[59] On June 2, 
Pillar recorded his first career two-home run game, and became the first 
right-handed batter to hit two home runs in one game off of Washington 
Nationals' ace Max Scherzer.[60][61] He was named the Blue Jays Player 
of the Month for June, as voted on by the Toronto Chapter of the Baseball 
Writers' Association of America (BBWAA), for a month in which he batted 
.365 (4th in the AL) with 5 stolen bases (tied for 7th in the AL) and 18 
RBIs (tied for 10th in the AL).[62] On September 28, Pillar was named the 
American League Player of the Week for September 21–27. He batted .524 
with 2 home runs, 6 RBI, and 5 stolen bases during that week.[63] Pillar 
played his first full Major League season in 2015 and set several career-highs. 
He finished the regular season batting .278 with 12 home runs, 56 RBI, 
and 25 stolen bases.[9] Pillar played in all 5 games of the 2015 American 
League Division Series against the Texas Rangers, and batted .333 with 
1 home run and 4 RBI.[9] Pillar and the Blue Jays then lost the American 
League Championship Series in 6 games to the Kansas City Royals, who went 
on to win the World Series. On October 29, Pillar was announced as a finalist 
for the Gold Glove award in center field, along with Kevin Kiermaier and 
Mike Trout, with the award eventually going to Kiermaier.[64] On November 
11, 2015, Pillar was named the 2015 Wilson Defensive Player of the Year 
for center field.[65] Pillar opened the season as the Blue Jays' lead-off 
hitter, but he struggled, hitting .188 with no walks through April 16, 
and was soon moved down in the order by manager John Gibbons.[66] In early 
August, Pillar was placed on the disabled list with a left thumb sprain. 
To that point in the season, Pillar had played in 109 of 112 games, and 
his 2.6 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) was second only to Josh Donaldson 
on the team.[67] On September 6, Pillar was announced as the Blue Jays' 
nominee for the Roberto Clemente Award.[68] Pillar appeared in 146 games 
for the Blue Jays in 2016, and hit .266 with seven home runs, 53 RBI, and 
14 stolen bases.[9] He led all MLB center fielders in defensive value according 
to Fangraphs, and was only surpassed in defensive value by shortstops Brandon 
Crawford and Francisco Lindor.[69] Pillar struggled with the bat in the 
postseason, going 3-for-32 at the plate with one home run and two RBI.[9] 
On October 27, Pillar was named as a finalist for the Gold Glove Award 
in center field, along with Jackie Bradley Jr. and Kevin Kiermaier.[69] 
On October 28, he was awarded the Fielding Bible Award for the center field
