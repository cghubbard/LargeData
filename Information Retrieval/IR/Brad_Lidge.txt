Bradley Thomas "Brad" Lidge (born December 23, 1976) is a former professional 
baseball relief pitcher. He pitched for the Houston Astros, Philadelphia 
Phillies and Washington Nationals. Lidge threw a four-seam fastball that 
consistently reached 91 or 92 miles per hour, as well as a hard, sharp 
breaking slider that ranged from 85 to 87 mph. He sealed the Phillies' 
2008 World Series championship with the final out, a strikeout of Eric 
Hinske in Game 5. Lidge was born in Sacramento, California on December 
23, 1976. At a young age, the Lidge family moved to Englewood, Colorado. 
Growing up, Lidge was very active, playing football, basketball and baseball 
among other sports. Lidge attended Cherry Creek High School.[1] Lidge attended 
the University of Notre Dame, where he played college baseball for the 
Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball team. He won the Big East Conference 
player of the year award during his junior season under coach Paul Mainieri, 
leading the conference with an 8–2 record and 93 strikeouts in 80 1⁄3 innings.[citation 
needed] Lidge was a 1st round draft pick by the Houston Astros, taken 17th 
overall in the 1998 Major League Baseball draft. He missed parts of his 
first four professional seasons (at Quad Cities, Kissimmee, Round Rock, 
and New Orleans) with injuries, including a torn rotator cuff and a broken 
forearm that threatened his career. Lidge would overcome these injuries, 
making his debut in the major leagues on April 26, 2002 against the Atlanta 
Braves, serving as a middle relief pitcher in the Astros' bullpen. He started 
the only game of his career in September of that year against the Milwaukee 
Brewers. Lidge went 2-for-2 with a double and 2 RBIs at the plate, but 
was pulled when he strained an intercostal muscle in his ribcage after 
pitching three scoreless innings with four strikeouts, two walks and a 
hit batsman. In 2003, Lidge was the winning pitcher in the Astros historic 
six-pitcher tandem which no-hit[2] the New York Yankees on June 11.[3] 
That year, Lidge was voted Astros Rookie of the Year by the Houston Chapter 
of the BBWAA.[4] Following the trades of Billy Wagner in the 2003 off-season 
and Octavio Dotel in the summer of 2004, the Astros moved Lidge from setup 
man to closer. He set a new National League record for strikeouts by a 
reliever with 157, passing Goose Gossage's total of 151 set in 1977. The 
mark is third all-time for relievers, behind Dick Radatz's 181 in 1964, 
and Mark Eichhorn's 166 in 1986. In the 2004 season, hitters swung and 
missed at Lidge's strikes almost 42% of the time; for balls out of the 
strike zone, batters missed more than 70% of the time. Baseball writer 
Joe Posnanski noted, "I have no doubt that Brad Lidge, that one year, was 
one of the most unhittable pitchers in the history of baseball."[5] In 
his first All-Star Game appearance in 2005, Lidge pitched the bottom of 
the seventh, striking out all three batters he faced. He threw 11 pitches 
(2 balls) to Melvin Mora, Mike Sweeney, and Garret Anderson, who did not 
make contact with any of Lidge's pitches. Lidge became the first pitcher 
to strike out the side in his first All-Star appearance since Bill Caudill 
and Dwight Gooden in 1984. Later in 2005, Lidge finished the season with 
a 2.29 ERA and a career-high 42 saves. That year, Lidge ranked third in 
the National League in saves and became the second Houston Astros pitcher 
ever to record at least 40 saves in one season alongside Billy Wagner. 
During the 2005 NLCS, Lidge gave up a 3-run home run to Albert Pujols in 
Game 5 in Houston which forced a Game 6 back in St. Louis, which the Astros 
would win to clinch their first World Series berth in franchise history. 
Lidge gave up a walk off home run to Scott Podsednik in Game 2 of the 2005 
World Series and the series winning run and hit in Game 4 to go 0-2 in 
the series and complete the White Sox sweep of the Astros. Lidge pitched 
for the United States national baseball team in the 2006 World Baseball 
Classic, throwing two scoreless innings. Later that year, Lidge became 
the third pitcher in Astros history to record 100 saves with the club, 
after Wagner and Dave Smith, and this led the Astros to sign Lidge to a 
one-year, $5.35 million contract that would keep him in Houston through 
the 2007 season.[6] However, Lidge was demoted from the closer's role on 
April 9, 2007.[7] Lidge would later regain his role in mid-June as the 
closer after going 10+ scoreless innings and posting a 2.45 era. On July 
17, 2007, Lidge pitched a scoreless ninth inning against the Washington 
Nationals, striking out two and walking one, to earn his first save of 
the 2007 season. Lidge finished the season 5–3 with 19 saves in 27 chances 
for the Astros. On November 7, 2007, Lidge was acquired by the Philadelphia 
Phillies along with infielder Eric Bruntlett in exchange for outfielder 
Michael Bourn, pitcher Geoff Geary, and Mike Costanzo.[8] In February 2008, 
Lidge tore the meniscus in his right knee while pitching off the mound 
during Spring training. To exacerbate matters, this was the same knee that 
he had had surgery on during the off-season. Later in the month, he had 
successful arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to repair the torn meniscus. 
As a result, Lidge sat out until April 5 to start the season. During the 
early 2008 season, Lidge showed signs that he regained the dominant form 
he displayed in his earlier career. In the opening two months of the season, 
he converted 12 save opportunities and allowed just two earned runs. In 
May, Lidge returned to Minute Maid Park, where he was greeted by a mixed 
reaction from Astros fans, but he recorded his 12th save of the season 
against his former team. He opened the month of June, usually the start 
of the summer's heavy-hitting season, with three saves earned in three 
straight games versus the Florida Marlins and the Cincinnati Reds. In July 
2008, Lidge signed a 3-year contract extension with the Phillies.[9] Lidge 
also set new Phillies records by converting his first 19 save opportunities 
and 35 straight saves. Lidge was named to the roster of the 2008 Major 
League Baseball All-Star Game. He was announced before the game as the 
closer. After warming up six separate times, he ended up the final pitcher 
available in the game, and pitched in the 15th inning. He allowed a game-winning 
sacrifice fly in the bottom half of the inning, as the American League 
won the game, 4–3. On September 27, 2008, Lidge became the first closer 
in Phillies history to be perfect in regular season saves, converting 41 
in as many opportunities, as he secured the National League East division 
title for the Phillies. He is the first closer since Éric Gagné in 2003 
to have a perfect conversion rate and 30+ saves.[10] Lidge finished the 
2008 season with 41 out of 41 save opportunities, a 1.95 ERA, and 92 strikeouts 
in 62 games. He saved the decisive Game 5 of the 2008 World Series in Philadelphia 
on October 29, 2008 with a strikeout, to make him 7 for 7 in postseason 
saves, thus completing his perfect season (a record he shares with John 
Wetteland, Troy Percival, Koji Uehara]Zach Britton and Greg Holland; Robb 
Nen was also 7 for 7 in 2002 before he blew one on the 8th opportunity). 
Lidge was eighth in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, behind Albert 
Pujols, Ryan Howard, Ryan Braun, Manny Ramirez, Lance Berkman, CC Sabathia, 
and David Wright, and was the only player other than Pujols or Howard to 
receive first place votes.[11] He received the MLB Comeback Player of the 
Year and DHL Delivery Man of the Year awards. Baseball fans nationwide 
voted him the MLB "This Year in Baseball Awards" Closer of the Year.[12] 
Lidge was voted the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association's Outstanding 
Pro Athlete of the Year award and honored at their annual dinner on January 
26, 2009.[13][14] He was named the inaugural recipient of the Daily News 
Sportsperson of the Year award. Lidge's 2009 season was a complete reversal 
of fortune from the prior year, in which he was perfect in save opportunities. 
Through the month of June, Lidge had an ERA of 7.57 in 27 2⁄3 innings pitched, 
while he converted only 14 of 20 save opportunities.[15] Lidge missed most 
of June due to injury, as he was placed on the disabled list due to a sprained 
right knee.[16] After returning to the Phillies, Lidge's performance did 
not improve and he continued to blow leads and save opportunities, but 
Phillies manager Charlie Manuel continued to support Lidge and reiterate 
that he was the team's closer.[17] By September, though, Lidge had struggled 
long enough that Manuel began using other relievers to close games. Lidge 
was used in different situations out of the bullpen, but did not find a 
role where he pitched consistently well.[18] Lidge finished the season 
with a win-loss record of 0–8, an ERA of 7.21, and 31 saves in 42 opportunities, 
and he allowed an average of 1.81 walks plus hits per inning pitched. For 
closers with at least 20 saves in a season, Lidge's 2009 ERA is the worst 
in MLB history.[19] Lidge's best month of the season was July, when his 
ERA was 5.91, and his best save streak stretched only 8 consecutive saves.[15] 
In the National League Division Series, Lidge appeared in Games 3 and 4 
in save situations, earning the save in both games.[20][21] In Game 1 of 
the 2009 National League Championship Series, Lidge secured his 3rd save 
helping the Phillies win 8 to 6. In Game 4 of the series, Lidge pitched 
in relief of Scott Eyre to retire the last two batters with the Phillies 
trailing 4–3 in the ninth inning. He eventually got his first win of 2009 
after Jimmy Rollins hit a game-winning double to give the Phillies a 5–4 
victory. Entering the 2009 World Series, Lidge and the New York Yankees' 
Mariano Rivera were the only closers who had not blown a save during the 
2009 postseason. In Game 4 which would be Lidge's only appearance in that 
World Series, he gave up three runs in the ninth inning, giving the Yankees 
a 7–4 win and a 3-1 lead in the series. The Yankees went on to win the 
series in six games. Lidge underwent elbow surgery in January 2010,[22] 
and he pitched in rehabilitation games with the Phillies' minor league 
teams (Clearwater, Reading, & Lehigh Valley) during the beginning of the 
2010 season.[23] He made his first major league appearance of the season 
on April 30 against the New York Mets, surrendering a home run to the first 
batter he faced and recording one out before being removed from the game. 
On June 22, 2010, Lidge recorded his 200th save against the Cleveland Indians. 
After spending most of the first half on the disabled list, Lidge rebounded 
from the previous season. He converted 17 of his last 18 save opportunities 
during the regular season and recorded two saves during a 2010 postseason 
in which he did not allow a run. Lidge finished 2010 with a 2.96 ERA and 
27 saves in 32 opportunities. Lidge started the year on the 60-day disabled 
list. He returned in late July 2011, losing his spot as the closer to teammate 
Ryan Madson. He took on a long reliever's role and at the end of the season, 
the Phillies declined his 2012 option, making him a free agent. On January 
27, 2012, Lidge signed a one-year contract with the Washington Nationals 
worth $1 million. Lidge was initially expected to be the setup man for 
Washington, but late in spring training it was expected that Lidge could 
become the closer after Drew Storen was sidelined with elbow inflammation.[24] 
After converting only 2 of 4 save opportunities and accruing a 5.14 ERA 
over seven single-inning appearances through April 21, Lidge was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list on April 27 (retroactive to April 22) with 
an abdominal wall strain. He was replaced on the roster by Ryan Perry and 
as closer by Henry Rodriguez.[25] Lidge returned to the active roster on 
June 7.[26] However, after a number of poor performances, Lidge was designated 
for assignment on June 17.[27] After a troubled 2012 season, Lidge retired 
from Major League Baseball on December 2, 2012.[28] On August 1, 2013, 
Lidge signed a one-day ceremonial contract, and officially retired as a 
Philadelphia Phillie. Lidge currently resides in Englewood, Colorado, with 
his wife, Lindsay, and their two children, daughter Avery Grace and son 
Rowan Thomas.[29] He has an interest in archaeology and religious studies
