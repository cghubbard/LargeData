Andre Ethier (/ˈiːθiər/; born April 10, 1982) is an American professional 
baseball outfielder for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Drafted in the second round (62nd pick overall) of the 2003 MLB 
draft, Ethier has played in the major leagues since 2006. Career highlights 
include All-Star selections in 2010 and 2011, a Silver Slugger Award in 
2009, and a Gold Glove Award in 2011. Primarily a right fielder throughout 
his career, Ethier has also filled in at left field and center field for 
the Dodgers. Andre Ethier was born on April 10, 1982 in Phoenix, Arizona. 
He is one of seven children born to Byron Ethier and Priscilla Ethier. 
There are a total of four brothers including Ethier – Adam, Devon and Steven, 
and three sisters – Catherine, Belinda and Shaye. His father Byron comes 
from a mixed background of French Canadian and Cherokee cultures and his 
mother Priscilla is Mexican American. His father, Byron Ethier, was also 
a baseball player and was coached under legend Gary Ward at Yavapai JC; 
he went as far as winning a JC national title while playing there.[1] One 
of the three brothers, Devon, also played baseball at Gateway Community 
College and was drafted by the Dodgers in the 32nd round of the 2010 MLB 
draft.[2] While attending Arizona State University (ASU), Andre met Maggie 
Germaine, who is a former ASU gymnast. She made school history while at 
ASU with a total of nine perfect 10.0 scores. The couple ended up marrying 
in 2006 and had two sons together, Jason and Tyson. On October 17 and 18 
of 2014, for their past successes at ASU, Andre and his wife were honored 
as the first husband-wife inductees in the Arizona State Sports Hall of 
Fame.[3] The family lives in West Hollywood. They follow the Catholic faith 
and attend Mass very regularly. He is a big fan of Korean food and enjoys 
spending time off the field with his wife and children.[4] Ethier transferred 
to Chandler-Gilbert Community College after playing with Arizona State 
University in the fall of 2000. The coaching staff at ASU told him that 
they thought he did not have Division I talent, and that he would do better 
to play junior college ball. At CGCC, Ethier batted .468 and accumulated 
94 hits, 32 of which were doubles. He was named team MVP.[1] During the 
summer of 2001, he played with the Keene Swamp Bats in the New England 
Collegiate Baseball League. In 2010, Ethier was inducted into the NECBL 
Hall of Fame. Ethier re-enrolled at ASU in the fall of 2001 and played 
there until the end of his junior year in 2003 with an ASU career batting 
average of .371, 113 runs, 27 doubles, 7 triples, 14 home runs and 118 
runs batted in. His collegiate career ended in the midst of a 23-game hitting 
streak. He was a two-time Pacific-10 Conference All-Star in 2002–03. During 
the summer of 2002, Ethier played with the Rochester Honkers of the Northwoods 
League, one of the country's premier summer collegiate baseball leagues. 
Ethier tied for the team lead in home runs (4), batted .264, led the team 
with 34 RBIs and won a Northwoods League Silver Glove for his defensive 
play in right field. While at ASU he was teammate and good friends with 
Dustin Pedroia and Ian Kinsler. Ethier was drafted by the Oakland Athletics 
in the 37th round of the 2001 amateur draft. Opting to attend ASU instead, 
he was drafted in the second round of the 2003 amateur draft, again by 
the Oakland Athletics. He signed with the Athletics on July 1, 2003. Oakland 
assigned him to the Single-A Vancouver Canadians and later to the Kane 
County Cougars for the 2003 season. His minor-league career continued in 
2004 with the Modesto Athletics, where he hit .313, and in 2005 with the 
Midland RockHounds Double-A team, where he hit .319 with 18 homers and 
was selected as the Texas League Most Valuable Player, Oakland Athletics 
Minor League Player of the Year, Texas League All-Star Outfielder and Texas 
League All-Star Game MVP. He also played four games in 2005 with the Sacramento 
Rivercats Triple-A team. [1] On December 13, 2005, Ethier was traded by 
the Oakland Athletics to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Milton Bradley and 
Antonio Perez.[5] Ethier hit a double and drew a walk in his Major League 
Baseball debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 2, 2006, against the 
Arizona Diamondbacks in his home state of Arizona and hit his first home 
run the next night against Dewon Brazelton of the San Diego Padres. On 
May 19, 2006, Ethier had a breakout game, going 5 for 5 with four runs 
scored as he raised his batting average from .222 to .317. He remained 
hot throughout the summer and was named National League Player of the Week 
for the week ending July 9, 2006. Ethier batted very well for much of the 
season with his average peaking at .354 before a late slump dropped it 
to .308 at season's end.[6] An early front-runner for the National League 
Rookie of the Year Award, he finished fifth in voting.[7] He used the song 
Alive by P.O.D. as his batting song his rookie year. Ethier entered the 
2007 Season expecting to split time with Matt Kemp, and Luis Gonzalez in 
the outfield, but Ethier got a lot of playing time early due to an injury 
to Kemp. Although he began the season fairly slow, hitting with a .250 
average in April, over the course of the first, three months to the season 
he managed to gradually raise his hitting average.[8] Overall, Ethier enjoyed 
a solid sophomore campaign, playing in 153 games while batting .284, with 
13 home runs, and 64 RBIs. Ethier beat out Juan Pierre to become the Dodgers 
starting left fielder for the start of the 2008 season.[9] When the Dodgers 
acquired outfielder Manny Ramirez, he moved to his more natural position 
of right field, with Kemp playing center field. In the regular season, 
Ethier played in 141 games, had 525 at-bats, scored 90 runs, had 160 hits, 
hit an average .305 batting avg. with 20 Homers and 77 RBIs. In 2009, Ethier 
hit .272 with a career-best 31 home runs and 106 RBI. For this performance, 
Ethier won a Silver Slugger Award and finished 6th in National League MVP 
voting.[10] Ethier was a key contributor for the Dodgers that season, with 
six walk off hits (including four walk off home runs), the most by any 
player in the Major Leagues since 1974.[11] His four walk-off home runs 
tied the Major League record for most in a season.[12] On June 26, 2009, 
Ethier hit three home runs in a game against the Seattle Mariners, driving 
in a career-high six runs. Thanks to his late-game heroics, Ethier earned 
the nickname "Captain Clutch". Ethier got off to a strong start to the 
2010 season, leading the National League in home runs, RBI and batting 
average, but he broke his pinky finger on his right hand during batting 
practice on May 15, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list three days 
later.[13] On July 4, Ethier was selected to start on the National League 
All Star team with more than 2.7 million votes. He slumped down the stretch, 
finishing with a .292 batting average, 23 home runs and 82 RBI in 139 games. 
Ethier set a new MLB record for April with a 23-game hitting streak on 
April 26 against the Florida Marlins, breaking the old record set by Joe 
Torre.[14] On April 30 Ethier extended this same streak to 27 games, moving 
past two former Dodgers to stand alone in second place in the franchise's 
history of hitting streaks and tie the Dodgers record for the most hits 
in April.[15] The streak eventually reached 30 games, second most in Dodger 
franchise history, before it ended on May 7 against the New York Mets. 
Ethier was a Final Vote candidate for the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game but finished second to Shane Victorino of the Philadelphia Phillies. 
However, Victorino was injured and unable to participate so Ethier was 
selected to replace him on the All-Star roster.[16] Ethier became the subject 
of some controversy in the second half of the season. Los Angeles Times 
columnist TJ Simers wrote an article that quoted Ethier as saying his production 
was down in 2011 because of a knee injury that he had been battling all 
season, and implying that the Dodgers were forcing him to play despite 
his injury.[17] Manager Don Mattingly called himself "blindsided" by the 
story and responded that he would never make a player play hurt.[18] After 
a meeting with Mattingly and GM Ned Colletti, Ethier backed off on his 
comments and said it was his choice to play hurt.[19] After the September 
7 game, Ethier decided to shut down for the season in order to consult 
doctors on the problems with his knee, with the hope of getting healthy 
in time for spring training.[20] Ethier appeared in 135 games with the 
Dodgers in 2011, hitting .291 with 11 home runs and 62 RBI. Despite his 
injury, Andre Ethier won his first Gold Glove Award on November 1, 2011. 
Clayton Kershaw and Matt Kemp also won Gold Gloves, giving the Dodgers 
three Gold Glove receivers in one year for the first time in franchise 
history.[21] On June 12, Ethier signed a five-year contract extension with 
the Dodgers. The deal was for $85 million through 2017 with a $17.5 million 
vesting option for 2018.[22] On August 25, Ethier got his tenth straight 
base hit, breaking the L.A. Dodger record set by Ron Cey in 1977 and tying 
the franchise record set by Ed Konetchy in 1919.[23] On September 4 against 
the San Diego Padres, Ethier collected his 1,000th career hit on a solo 
homer in the 2nd inning.[24] He played in 149 games in 2012, hitting .284 
with 20 homers and 89 RBI. After being a corner outfielder for his entire 
career, Ethier was moved to center field for the first time in the Majors 
in 2013 because of injuries to Matt Kemp.[25] On September 2, Ethier became 
the first player in Dodger history to record seven seasons with 30 or more 
doubles.[26] His season though took a quick step back after getting injured. 
Since September 13, Ethier was wearing a walking boot for a sore foot that 
caused him to miss several games at the end of the season and limited him 
in the playoffs.[27] For the entire season though he managed to play a 
total of 142 games and hit .272 with 12 homers, 33 doubles and 52 RBI. 
In late May, Ethier was once again moved to center field, becoming the 
starting center fielder for the Dodgers due to Kemp's defensive struggles. 
However, with Puig moving to center and Kemp's resurgence in right field 
Ethier became a reserve for most of the second half of the season. General 
Manager Ned Colletti said that he believed that Ethier could become a needed 
late-inning power bat. His teammates praised him throughout the season 
for accepting his role and not creating problems, despite his rich contract.[28] 
The LA Times mentioned that Ethier was able to remain completely professional 
over the entire situation, unlike some past Dodger players who would publicly 
complain about getting less time on the field and possibly losing their 
positions. Ethier continued to show up for the pre-game autographs and 
photos, continuing to remain normal and popular among his fans.[28] Ethier 
played only 130 games, the fewest in his career since his rookie season, 
hitting .249 with 4 home runs and 42 RBIs, mostly in pinch-hit scenarios. 
He had the worst season of his career in every offensive category other 
than triples.[29] Due to early-season injuries to outfielders Yasiel Puig 
and Carl Crawford, Ethier established himself as a near-everyday player 
in the first half of the season. On August 2, he hit two go-ahead home 
runs against the Angels, including a walk-off home run in the 10th inning, 
to earn the Dodgers their first three-game sweep over their city rivals 
since 2006. It was the 7th walk-off home run, and 14th walk-off hit, of 
Ethier's career, which placed him 2nd all-time in franchise history behind 
only the 16 by Dusty Baker. He played in 142 games and hit .294 (his highest 
number since 2008) with 14 home runs and 53 RBI. During the 2016 Spring 
training, Ethier suffered a fractured right tibia after fouling a ball 
off his shin in a game. The injury did not require surgery but he would 
be out for 10–14 weeks.[30] The injury was more severe than expected and 
he did not rejoin the Dodgers roster until September 10.[31] He only appeared 
in 16 games, primarily as a pinch hitter, down the stretch, with five hits 
in 24 at-bats including one home run.[32] He had six at-bats as a pinch 
hitter for the Dodgers in the playoffs with two hits, one of which was
