John Charles Kucks (July 27, 1933 – October 31, 2013)[1] was a pitcher 
for the New York Yankees and Kansas City Athletics in Major League Baseball. 
In 1952, he was signed as an amateur free agent. Johnny Kucks won the final 
game of the 1956 World Series between the Yankees and Brooklyn Dodgers, 
shutting out the Dodgers, 9–0 at Ebbets Field—the last World Series game 
ever played in that stadium.[2] Born July 27, 1933, in Hoboken, New Jersey, 
Kucks grew up in Jersey City and played baseball at William L. Dickinson 
High School.[3] On May 26, 1959 he was traded to the Kansas City Athletics, 
together with Jerry Lumpe and Tom Sturdivant, for Ralph Terry and Héctor 
López. On October 11, 1961 he was purchased by the Baltimore Orioles from 
the Athletics, but on December 1, 1961 the Orioles traded him to the St. 
Louis Cardinals for minor leaguer Ron Kabbes; however, he never played 
again in the majors. Kucks was also the last pitcher to face Jackie Robinson, 
striking him out for the final out of the 1956 World Series. A longtime 
resident of Hillsdale, New Jersey since his days with the Yankees, Kucks 
worked as a stockbroker after his baseball career ended. He died of cancer 
on October 31, 2013, at the Villa Marie Claire hospice in Saddle River,
