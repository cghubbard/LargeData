Trenton is a city in the U.S. state of New Jersey; it is the state capital 
and the county seat of Mercer County, as well as a former capital of the 
United States.[21][22] The city's metropolitan area is grouped with the 
New York metropolitan area by the United States Census Bureau,[23] but 
directly borders the Philadelphia metropolitan area and is part of the 
Federal Communications Commission's Philadelphia Designated Market Area.[24] 
As of the 2010 United States Census, Trenton had a population of 84,913,[10][11][12] 
making it the state's 10th-largest municipality. The Census Bureau estimated 
that the city's population was 84,034 in 2014.[13] Trenton dates back at 
least to June 3, 1719, when mention was made of a constable being appointed 
for Trenton, while the area was still part of Hunterdon County. Boundaries 
were recorded for Trenton Township as of March 2, 1720,[25] a courthouse 
and jail were constructed in Trenton around 1720 and the Freeholders of 
Hunterdon County met annually in Trenton.[26] Trenton became New Jersey's 
capital as of November 25, 1790, and the City of Trenton was formed within 
Trenton Township on November 13, 1792. Trenton Township was incorporated 
as one of New Jersey's initial group of 104 townships by an act of the 
New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. On February 22, 1834, portions 
of Trenton Township were taken to form Ewing Township. The remaining portion 
of Trenton Township was absorbed by the City of Trenton on April 10, 1837. 
A series of annexations took place over a 50-year period, with the city 
absorbing South Trenton borough (April 14, 1851), portions of Nottingham 
Township (April 14, 1856), both the Borough of Chambersburg Township and 
Millham Township (both on March 30, 1888), as well as Wilbur Borough (February 
28, 1898). Portions of Ewing Township and Hamilton Township were annexed 
to Trenton on March 23, 1900.[25][27] The first settlement which would 
become Trenton was established by Quakers in 1679, in the region then called 
the Falls of the Delaware, led by Mahlon Stacy from Handsworth, Sheffield, 
England. Quakers were being persecuted in England at this time and North 
America provided an opportunity to exercise their religious freedom.[28] 
By 1719, the town adopted the name "Trent-towne", after William Trent, 
one of its leading landholders who purchased much of the surrounding land 
from Stacy's family. This name later was shortened to "Trenton".[29][30][31] 
During the American Revolutionary War, the city was the site of the Battle 
of Trenton, George Washington's first military victory. On December 26, 
1776, Washington and his army, after crossing the icy Delaware River to 
Trenton, defeated the Hessian troops garrisoned there.[32] After the war, 
the Confederation Congress briefly met in Trenton in November and December 
1784.[33] While the city was preferred by New England and other northern 
states as a permanent capital for the new country, the southern states 
ultimately prevailed in their choice of a location south of the Mason–Dixon 
line.[34] Trenton became the state capital in 1790, but prior to that year 
the New Jersey Legislature often met here.[35] The city was incorporated 
in 1792.[25] During the War of 1812, the United States Army's primary hospital 
was at a site on Broad Street.[36] Throughout the 19th century, Trenton 
grew steadily, as European immigrants came to work in its pottery and wire 
rope mills. In 1837, with the population now too large for government by 
council, a new mayoral government was adopted, with by-laws that remain 
in operation to this day.[37] According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the city had a total area of 8.155 square miles (21.122 km2), including 
7.648 square miles (19.809 km2) of land and 0.507 square mile (1.313 km2) 
of water (6.21%).[2][3] Several bridges across the Delaware River — the 
Trenton–Morrisville Toll Bridge, Lower Trenton Bridge and Calhoun Street 
Bridge – connect Trenton to Morrisville, Pennsylvania, all of which are 
operated by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission.[38] Trenton 
is located near the exact geographic center of the state, which is 5 miles 
(8.0 km) located southeast of Trenton.[39] So it is sometimes included 
as part of North Jersey and as the southernmost city of the Tri-State Region, 
while others consider it a part of South Jersey and thus, the northernmost 
city of the Delaware Valley.[citation needed] However, Mercer County constitutes 
its own metropolitan statistical area, formally known as the Trenton-Ewing 
MSA.[40] Locals consider Trenton to be a part of an ambiguous area called 
Central Jersey, and thus part of neither region. They are generally split 
as to whether they are within New York or Philadelphia's sphere of influence. 
While it is geographically closer to Philadelphia, many people who have 
recently moved to the area commute to New York City, and have moved there 
to escape the New York region's high housing costs. Trenton is one of two 
state capitals that border another state – the other being Carson City, 
Nevada.[41] Trenton borders Ewing Township, Hamilton Township and Lawrence 
Township in Mercer County; and Falls Township, Lower Makefield Township 
and Morrisville in Bucks County, Pennsylvania across the Delaware River.[42] 
The city of Trenton is home to numerous neighborhoods and sub-neighborhoods. 
The main neighborhoods are taken from the four cardinal directions (North, 
South, East, and West). Trenton was once home to large Italian, Hungarian, 
and Jewish communities, but since the 1950s, demographic shifts have changed 
the city into a relatively segregated urban enclave of middle and lower 
income African Americans. Italians are scattered throughout the city, but 
a distinct Italian community is centered in the Chambersburg neighborhood, 
in South Trenton.[43] This community has been in decline since the 1970s, 
largely due to economic and social shifts to the more prosperous, less 
crime-ridden suburbs surrounding the city. Today Chambersburg has a large 
Latino community. Many of the Latino immigrants are from Mexico, Guatemala 
and Nicaragua. There is also a significant and growing Asian community 
in the Chambersburg neighborhood primarily made up of Burmese and Bhutanese/Nepali 
refugees. The North Ward, once a mecca for the city's middle class, is 
now one of the most economically distressed, torn apart by race riots following 
the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968. Nonetheless, the area 
still retains many important architectural and historic sites. North Trenton 
still has a large Polish-American neighborhood that borders Lawrence Township, 
many of whom attend St Hedwig's Roman Catholic Church on Brunswick Ave. 
St. Hedwig's church was built in 1904 by Polish immigrants, many of whose 
families still attend the church. North Trenton is also home to the historic 
Shiloh Baptist Church—one of the largest houses of worship in Trenton and 
the oldest African American church in the city, founded in 1888. The church 
is currently pastored by Rev. Darrell L. Armstrong, who carried the Olympic 
torch in 2002 for the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Also located just 
at the southern tip of North Trenton is the city's Battle Monument, also 
known as "Five Points". It is a 150 ft (46 m) structure that marks the 
spot where George Washington's Continental Army launched the Battle of 
Trenton during the American Revolutionary War. It faces downtown Trenton 
and is a symbol of the city's historic past. South Ward is the most diverse 
neighborhood in Trenton and is home to many Latin American, Italian-American, 
and African American residents.[citation needed] East Ward is the smallest 
neighborhood in Trenton and is home to the Trenton Transit Center and Trenton 
Central High School. Recently, two campuses have been added, Trenton Central 
High School West and Trenton Central High School North, respectively, to 
this area of the city. The Chambersburg neighborhood is within the East 
Ward, and was once noted in the region as a destination for its many Italian 
restaurants and pizzerias. With changing demographics, many of these businesses 
have either closed or relocated to suburban locations. West Ward is the 
home of Trenton's more suburban neighborhoods. Neighborhoods in the city 
include:[44] According to the Köppen climate classification, Trenton lies 
in the transition from a humid subtropical (Cfa) to a humid continental 
climate (Dfa), with four seasons of approximately equal length and precipitation 
fairly evenly distributed through the year. Winters are cold and damp: 
the daily average temperature in January is 31.1 °F (−0.5 °C), and temperatures 
at or below 10 °F (−12 °C) occur on 3.9 nights annually, while there are 
16–17 days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing. Summers 
are hot and humid, with a July daily average of 75.7 °F (24.3 °C); temperatures 
reaching or exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) occur on 15–16 days. Extremes in temperature 
have ranged from −14 °F (−26 °C) on February 9, 1934, up to 106 °F (41 °C) 
as recently as July 22, 2011.[45] However, temperatures reaching 0 °F (−18 °C) 
or 100 °F (38 °C) are uncommon. The average precipitation is 46.4 inches 
(1,180 mm) per year, which is fairly evenly distributed through the year. 
The driest month on average is February, with 2.31 in (59 mm) of precipitation 
on average, while the wettest month is July, with 4.95 in (126 mm) of rainfall 
on average. The all-time single-day rainfall record is 7.25 in (184.2 mm) 
on September 16, 1999, during the passage of Hurricane Floyd. The all-time 
monthly rainfall record is 14.55 in (369.6 mm) in August 1955, due to the 
passage of Hurricane Connie and Hurricane Diane. The wettest year on record 
was 1996, when 67.90 in (1,725 mm) of precipitation fell. On the flip side, 
the driest month on record was October 1963, when only 0.05 in (1.3 mm) 
of rain was recorded. The 28.79 in (731 mm) of precipitation recorded in 
1957 were the lowest ever for the city.[46] Snowfall can vary even more 
year-to-year. The average snowfall is 23.4 inches (59.4 cm), but has ranged 
from as low as 2 in (5.1 cm) in the winter of 1918–19 to as high as 76.9 in 
(195.3 cm) in 1995–96, which included the greatest single-storm snowfall, 
the Blizzard of January 7–8, 1996, when 24.2 inches (61.5 cm) of snow fell.[citation

households, and 17,747 families residing in the city. The population density 
was 11,101.9 per square mile (4,286.5/km2). There were 33,035 housing units 
at an average density of 4,319.2 per square mile (1,667.7/km2). The racial

(110) Pacific Islander, 15.31% (13,003) from other races, and 4.10% (3,480) 
from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 33.71% (28,621) 
of the population.[10] There were 28,578 households, of which 32.0% had 
children under the age of 18 living with them, 25.1% were married couples 
living together, 28.1% had a female householder with no husband present, 
and 37.9% were non-families. 30.8% of all households were made up of individuals, 
and 9.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The

there were 106.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 
107.2 males.[10] The Census Bureau's 2006–2010 American Community Survey 
showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household income 
was $36,601 (with a margin of error of +/- $1,485) and the median family 
income was $41,491 (+/- $2,778). Males had a median income of $29,884 (+/- 
$1,715) versus $31,319 (+/- $2,398) for females. The per capita income 
for the city was $17,400 (+/- $571). About 22.4% of families and 24.5% 
of the population were below the poverty line, including 36.3% of those 
under age 18 and 17.5% of those age 65 or over.[62] As of the 2000 United 
States Census[18] there were 85,403, people, 29,437 households, and 18,692 
families residing in the city. The population density was 11,153.6 people 
per square mile (4,304.7/km²). There were 33,843 housing units at an average

Trenton was a major manufacturing center in the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries. One relic of that era is the slogan "Trenton Makes, The World 
Takes", which is displayed on the Lower Free Bridge (just north of the 
Trenton–Morrisville Toll Bridge).[64] The city adopted the slogan in 1917 
to represent Trenton's then-leading role as a major manufacturing center 
for rubber, wire rope, ceramics and cigars.[65] Along with many other United 
States cities in the 1970s, Trenton fell on hard times when manufacturing 
and industrial jobs declined. Concurrently, state government agencies began 
leasing office space in the surrounding suburbs. State government leaders 
(particularly governors William Cahill and Brendan Byrne) attempted to 
revitalize the downtown area by making it the center of state government. 
Between 1982 and 1992, more than a dozen office buildings were constructed 
primarily by the state to house state offices.[66] Today, Trenton's biggest 
employer is still the state of New Jersey. Each weekday, 20,000 state workers 
flood into the city from the surrounding suburbs.[67] Businesses based 
in Trenton include Italian People's Bakery, a wholesale and retail bakery 
established in 1936.[68] Portions of Trenton are part of an Urban Enterprise 
Zone. In addition to other benefits to encourage employment within the 
Zone, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3½% sales tax rate at eligible 
merchants (versus the 7% rate charged statewide).[69] Trenton has long 
been part of the Philadelphia television market. However, following the 
2000 United States Census, Trenton was shifted from the Philadelphia metropolitan 
statistical area to the New York metropolitan statistical area. With a 
similar shift by the New Haven, Connecticut, area to the New York area, 
they were the first two cases where metropolitan statistical areas differed 
from their defined Nielsen television markets.[70] Because of Trenton's 
near-equal distance to both New York City and Philadelphia, and because 
most homes in Mercer County receive network broadcasts from both cities, 
locals are sharply divided in fan loyalty between both cities. It is common 
to find Philadelphia's Phillies, Eagles, 76ers, Union and Flyers fans cheering 
(and arguing) right alongside fans of New York's Yankees, Mets, Nets, Knicks, 
Rangers, Jets, Red Bulls and Giants or the New Jersey Devils.[81] Between 
1948 and 1979, Trenton Speedway, located in adjacent Hamilton Township, 
hosted world class auto racing. Drivers such as Jim Clark, A. J. Foyt, 
Mario Andretti, Al Unser, Bobby Unser, Richard Petty and Bobby Allison 
raced on the one mile (1.6 km) asphalt oval and then re-configured 1½ mile 
race track.[82] The speedway, which closed in 1980, was part of the larger 
New Jersey State Fairgrounds complex, which also closed in 1983. The former 
site of the speedway and fairgrounds is now the Grounds for Sculpture.[83] 
The Trenton Thunder, a Double-A minor league team affiliated with the New 
York Yankees that is owned by Joe Plumeri, plays at 6,341-seat Arm & Hammer 
Park, the stadium which Plumeri had previously named after his father in 
1999.[84][85][86] The Trenton Freedom of the Professional Indoor Football 
League were founded in 2013 and played their games at the Sun National 
Bank Center. The Freedom ended operations in 2015, joining the short-lived 
Trenton Steel (in 2011) and Trenton Lightning (in 2001) as indoor football 
teams that had brief operating lives at the arena.[87] The City of Trenton 
is governed within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal 
Charter Law, under the Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council) system of municipal 
government by a mayor and a seven-member city council. Three city council 
members are elected at-large, and four come from each of four wards. The 
mayor and council members are elected concurrently on a non-partisan basis 
to four-year terms of office as part of the May municipal election.[8][92] 
As of 2016[update], the Mayor of Trenton is Eric Jackson. Members of the 
City Council are Council President Zachary Chester (West Ward), Council 
Vice President Verlina Reynolds-Jackson (East Ward), Alex Bethea (At-Large), 
Marge Caldwell-Wilson (North Ward), Duncan Harrison Jr. (At-Large), Phyllis 
Holly-Ward (At-Large), George Muschal (South Ward), all serving terms of 
office ending June 30, 2018.[4][93][94][95][96] From February 7 to July 
1, 2014 the acting mayor was George Muschal who retroactively assumed the 
office on that date due to the felony conviction of Tony F. Mack, who had 
taken office on July 1, 2010.[97][98] Muschal, who was council president, 
was selected by the city council to serve as the interim mayor to finish 
the term.[99] On February 7, 2014, Mack and his brother, Raphiel Mack, 
were convicted by a federal jury of bribery, fraud and extortion, based 
on the details of their participation in a scheme to take money in exchange 
for helping get approvals to develop a downtown parking garage as part 
of a fictitious sting operation by law enforcement.[100] Days after the 
conviction, the office of the New Jersey Attorney General filed motions 
to have Mack removed from office, as state law requires the removal of 
elected officials after convictions for corruption.[101] Initially, Mack 
fought the removal of him from the office but on February 26, a superior 
court judge ordered his removal and any actions taken by Mack between February 
7 and the 26th could have be reversed by Muschal.[99] Previously, Mack's 
housing director quit after it was learned he had a theft conviction. His 
chief of staff was arrested trying to buy heroin. His half-brother, whose 
authority he elevated at the city water plant, was arrested on charges 
of stealing. His law director resigned after arguing with Mack over complying 
with open-records laws and potential violations of laws prohibiting city 
contracts to big campaign donors.[102] Trenton is located in the 12th Congressional 
District[103] and is part of New Jersey's 15th state legislative district.[11][104][105] 
Prior to the 2010 Census, Trenton had been split between the 4th Congressional 
District and the 12th Congressional District, a change made by the New 
Jersey Redistricting Commission that took effect in January 2013, based 
on the results of the November 2012 general elections.[106] New Jersey's 
Twelfth Congressional District is represented by Bonnie Watson Coleman 
(D, Ewing Township).[107] New Jersey is represented in the United States 
Senate by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term ends 2021)[108] and Bob Menendez 
(D, Paramus, 2019).[109][110] For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General 
Assembly), the 15th Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature 
is represented in the State Senate by Shirley Turner (D, Lawrence Township, 
Mercer County) and in the General Assembly by Reed Gusciora (D, Trenton) 
and Elizabeth Maher Muoio (D, Pennington).[111] The Governor of New Jersey 
is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[112] The Lieutenant Governor of 
New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[113] Mercer County is governed 
by a County Executive who oversees the day-to-day operations of the county 
and by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders that acts in a legislative 
capacity, setting policy. All officials are chosen at-large in partisan 
elections, with the executive serving a four-year term of office while 
the freeholders serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, 
with either two or three seats up for election each year.[114] As of 2014[update], 
the County Executive is Brian M. Hughes (D, term ends December 31, 2015; 
Princeton).[115] Mercer County's Freeholders are Freeholder Chair Andrew 
Koontz (D, 2016; Princeton),[116] Freeholder Vice Chair Samuel T. Frisby, 
Sr. (2015; Trenton),[117] Ann M. Cannon (2015; East Windsor Township),[118] 
Anthony P. Carabelli (2016; Trenton),[119] John A. Cimino (2014, Hamilton 
Township),[120] Pasquale "Pat" Colavita, Jr. (2015; Lawrence Township)[121] 
and Lucylle R. S. Walter (2014; Ewing Township)[122][123][124] Mercer County's 
constitutional officers are County Clerk Paula Sollami-Covello (D, 2015),[125] 
Sheriff John A. Kemler (D, 2014)[126] and Surrogate Diane Gerofsky (D, 
2016).[127][128] As of March 23, 2011, there were a total of 37,407 registered 
voters in Trenton, of which 16,819 (45.0%) were registered as Democrats, 
1,328 (3.6%) were registered as Republicans and 19,248 (51.5%) were registered 
as Unaffiliated. There were 12 voters registered to other parties.[129] 
In the 2012 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama received 93.4% 
of the vote (23,125 cast), ahead of Republican Mitt Romney with 6.2% (1,528 
votes), and other candidates with 0.4% (97 votes), among the 27,831 ballots 
cast by the city's 40,362 registered voters (3,081 ballots were spoiled), 
for a turnout of 69.0%.[130][131] In the 2008 presidential election, Democrat 
Barack Obama received 89.9% of the vote here (23,577 cast), ahead of Republican 
John McCain with 8.2% (2,157 votes) and other candidates with 0.5% (141 
votes), among the 26,229 ballots cast by the city's 41,005 registered voters, 
for a turnout of 64.0%.[132] In the 2004 presidential election, Democrat 
John Kerry received 79.8% of the vote here (18,539 ballots cast), outpolling 
Republican George W. Bush with 16.3% (3,791 votes) and other candidates 
with 0.4% (146 votes), among the 23,228 ballots cast by the city's 39,139 
registered voters, for a turnout percentage of 59.3.[133] In the 2013 gubernatorial 
election, Democrat Barbara Buono received 74.7% of the vote (9,179 cast), 
ahead of Republican Chris Christie with 24.7% (3,035 votes), and other 
candidates with 0.6% (77 votes), among the 11,884 ballots cast by the city's 
38,452 registered voters (407 ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 30.9%.[134][135] 
In the 2009 gubernatorial election, Democrat Jon Corzine received 81.6% 
of the vote here (10,235 ballots cast), ahead of Republican Chris Christie 
with 12.4% (1,560 votes), Independent Chris Daggett with 2.4% (305 votes) 
and other candidates with 1.1% (135 votes), among the 12,537 ballots cast 
by the city's 38,345 registered voters, yielding a 32.7% turnout.[136] 
The city of Trenton is protected on a full-time basis by the city of Trenton 
Fire and Emergency Services Department (TFD), which has been a paid department 
since 1892 after having been originally established in 1747 as a volunteer 
fire department.[137] The TFD operates out of seven fire stations and operates 
a fire apparatus fleet of 7 engines, 3 ladders, and one rescue, along with 
one HAZMAT unit, a mobile command unit, one fireboat, and numerous other 
special, support and reserve units.[138] Trenton is the home of two post-secondary 
institutions—Thomas Edison State University serving adult students around 
the nation and worldwide[139] and Mercer County Community College's James 
Kearney Campus.[140] The College of New Jersey, formerly named Trenton 
State College, was founded in Trenton in 1855 and is now located in nearby 
Ewing Township. Rider University was founded in Trenton in 1865 as The 
Trenton Business College. In 1959, Rider moved to its current location 
in nearby Lawrence Township.[141] The Trenton Public Schools serve students 
in Kindergarten through twelfth grade. The district is one of 31 former 
Abbott districts statewide,[142] which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" 
based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building 
and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the 
New Jersey Schools Development Authority.[143][144] The superintendent 
runs the district and the school board is appointed by the mayor. The school 
district has undergone a 'construction' renaissance throughout the district. 
Trenton Central High School is Trenton's only traditional public high school.

Trenton is home to several charter schools, including Capital Preparatory 
Charter High School, Emily Fisher Charter School, Foundation Academy Charter 
School, International Charter School, Paul Robeson Charter School, and 
Village Charter School.[173] The International Academy of Trenton, owned 
by the SABIS school network, became a charter school in 2014; The school 
opened serving grades K-3 and will add an additional grade each year, ultimately 
serving students through 12th grade.[174] Trenton Catholic Academy high 
school serves students in grades 9–12, while Trenton Catholic Academy grammar 
school serves students in Pre-K through 8th grade; both schools operate 
under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Trenton.[175] Trenton 
is home to Al-Bayaan Academy, which opened for preschool students in September 
2001 and added grades in subsequent years.[176] Trenton Community Music 
School is a not-for-profit community school of the arts. The school was 
founded by executive director Marcia Wood in 1997. The school operates 
at Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church (on Tuesdays) and the Copeland Center 
for the Performing Arts (on Saturdays). In 2005, there were 31 homicides 
in Trenton, which at that time was the largest number in a single year 
in the city's history.[177] The city was named the 4th "Most Dangerous" 
in 2005 out of 129 cities with a population of 75,000 to 99,999 ranked 
nationwide in the 12th annual Morgan Quitno survey.[178] In the 2006 survey, 
Trenton was ranked as the 14th most dangerous city overall out of 371 cities 
included nationwide in the Morgan Quitno survey, and was again named as 
the fourth most dangerous municipality of 126 cities in the 75,000–99,999 
population range.[179] Homicides went down in 2006 to 20, but back up to 
25 in 2007.[180] In September 2011, the city fired 108 police officers 
due to budget cuts; this constituted almost one-third of the Trenton Police 
Department and required 30 senior officers to be sent out on patrols in 
lieu of supervisory duties.[181] In 2013, the city set a new record with 
37 homicides.[182] In 2014, there were 23 murders through the end of July 
and the city's homicide rate was on track to break the record set the previous 
year until an 81-day period when there were no murders in Trenton; the 
city ended the year with 34 murders.[183][184] The number of homicides 
declined to 17 in 2015.[185] The Trenton Riots of 1968 were a major civil 
disturbance that took place during the week following the assassination 
of civil rights leader Martin Luther King in Memphis on April 4. Race riots 
broke out nationwide following the murder of the civil rights activist. 
More than 200 Trenton businesses, mostly in Downtown, were ransacked and 
burned. More than 300 people, most of them young black men, were arrested 
on charges ranging from assault and arson to looting and violating the 
mayor's emergency curfew. In addition to 16 injured policemen, 15 firefighters 
were treated at city hospitals for smoke inhalation, burns, sprains and 
cuts suffered while fighting raging blazes or for injuries inflicted by 
rioters. Denizens of Trenton's urban core often pulled false alarms and 
would then throw bricks at firefighters responding to the alarm boxes. 
This experience, along with similar experiences in other major cities, 
effectively ended the use of open-cab fire engines. As an interim measure, 
the Trenton Fire Department fabricated temporary cab enclosures from steel 
deck plating until new equipment could be obtained. The losses incurred 
by downtown businesses were initially estimated by the city to be $7 million, 
but the total of insurance claims and settlements came to $2.5 million.[186] 
Trenton's Battle Monument neighborhood was hardest hit. Since the 1950s, 
North Trenton had witnessed a steady exodus of middle-class residents, 
and the riots spelled the end for North Trenton. By the 1970s, the region 
had become one of the most blighted and crime-ridden in the city, although 
gentrification in the area is revitalizing certain sections. The New Jersey 
State Prison (formerly Trenton State Prison) has two maximum security units. 
It houses some of the state's most dangerous individuals, which included 
New Jersey's death row population until the state banned capital punishment 
in 2007.[187] The following is inscribed over the original entrance to 
the prison: Labor, Silence, Penitence. The Penitentiary House, Erected

May 2010[update], the city had a total of 168.80 miles (271.66 km) of roadways, 
of which 145.57 miles (234.27 km) were maintained by the municipality, 
11.33 miles (18.23 km) by Mercer County and 10.92 miles (17.57 km) by the 
New Jersey Department of Transportation and 0.98 miles (1.58 km) by the 
Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission.[189] City highways include 
the Trenton Freeway, which is part of U.S. Route 1, and the John Fitch 
Parkway, which is part of Route 29. Canal Boulevard, more commonly known 
as Route 129, connects US Route 1 and NJ Route 29 in South Trenton. U.S. 
Route 206, Route 31, and Route 33 also pass through the city via regular 
city streets (Broad Street/Brunswick Avenue/Princeton Avenue, Pennington 
Avenue, and Greenwood Avenue, respectively). Routes 29 and 129 connect 
the city to Interstate 195 which provides connections with Interstate 295 
and the New Jersey Turnpike (also known as Interstate 95). Public transportation 
within the city and to/from its nearby suburbs is provided in the form 
of local bus routes run by NJ Transit. SEPTA also provides bus service 
to adjacent Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The Trenton Transit Center, located 
on the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor, serves as the northbound terminus 
for SEPTA's Trenton Line (local train service to Philadelphia) and southbound 
terminus for NJ Transit Rail's Northeast Corridor Line (local train service 
to New York Penn Station). The train station also serves as the northbound 
terminus for the River Line, a diesel light rail line that runs to Camden.[190] 
Two additional River Line stops, Cass Street and Hamilton Avenue, are located 
within the city. Long-distance transportation is provided by Amtrak train 
service along the Northeast Corridor. The closest commercial airport is 
Trenton–Mercer Airport in Ewing Township, about 8 miles (13 km) from the 
center of Trenton, which has been served by Frontier Airlines offering 
service to and from points nationwide. In January 2015, Frontier cited 
low demand as the reason behind its decision to cut service to five cities 
in the Midwest, leaving 13 destinations available to passengers.[191] Other 
nearby major airports are Newark Liberty International Airport and Philadelphia 
International Airport, located 55.2 miles (88.8 km) and 43.4 miles (69.8 km) 
away, respectively, and reachable by direct New Jersey Transit or Amtrak 
rail link (to Newark) and by SEPTA Regional Rail (to Philadelphia). NJ 
Transit Bus Operations provides bus service between Trenton and Philadelphia 
on the 409 route, with service to surrounding communities on the 600, 601, 
602, 603, 604, 606, 607, 608, 609 and 611 routes.[192] Trenton is served 
by two daily newspapers: The Times and The Trentonian, as well as a monthly 
advertising magazine: "The City" Trenton N.E.W.S.. Radio station WKXW is 
also licensed to Trenton. Defunct periodicals include the Trenton True 
American. A local television station, WPHY-CD TV-25, serves the entire 
Trenton area.[193]' Trenton is officially part of the Philadelphia television 
market but some local pay TV operators also carry stations serving the 
New York market. While it is its own radio market, many Philadelphia and 
New York stations are easily receivable. People who were born in, residents 
of, or otherwise closely associated with Trenton include: Nation: States:
