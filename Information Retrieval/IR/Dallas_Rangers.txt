The Dallas Rangers were a high-level minor league baseball team located 
in Dallas, Texas from 1958 to 1964. The team was known by the Dallas Rangers 
name in 1958, 1959, and 1964 and as the Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers from 
1960 to 1963. It played in the Double-A Texas League in 1958, the Triple-A 
American Association from 1959 to 1962 and the Triple-A Pacific Coast League 
in 1963 and 1964. Its home stadium was Burnett Field. Both Dallas and Fort 
Worth had long and storied histories in the Texas League. The Dallas club 
had had many nicknames since its founding in 1902 including the Griffins 
(1902), Giants (1903–1918), Marines (1919), Submarines (1920–1921), Steers 
(1922–1938), Rebels (1939–1942, 1946–1947) and Eagles (1948–1957), before 
it was dubbed the Rangers in 1958,[1] its final TL campaign. The Fort Worth 
team was called the Panthers (1902–1931) and the Cats (1932–1942, 1946–1958, 
1964). In 1959, the American Association expanded and admitted both cities, 
Dallas as an unaffiliated club and Fort Worth as an affiliate of the Chicago 
Cubs. Dallas outdrew Fort Worth, 130,000 to 97,000, and the two teams were 
merged in 1960 as the top farm team of the Kansas City Athletics. The Dallas 
Cowboys, Clint Murchison's new NFL franchise, were originally to be called 
the "Dallas Rangers" because the baseball team's owners had told him in 
1959 that they were disbanding. When the owners reversed course the following 
year, Murchison volunteered to rename his new team to avoid confusion.[2] 
The Rangers struggled on the field and at the gate in 1960, finishing last 
and drawing only 113,000 fans. In 1961 and 1962, the team was affiliated 
with the expansion Los Angeles Angels and featured future MLB stars such 
as Jim Fregosi and Dean Chance, but continued to lag behind other Association 
members in attendance. In 1962, the team was jointly affiliated with both 
the Angels and the Philadelphia Phillies. When the American Association 
itself folded after the 1962 season, the Rangers joined the Pacific Coast 
League and affiliated with the Minnesota Twins. The 1963 Dallas-Fort Worth 
Rangers, managed by Jack McKeon, finally reached the .500 level, but the 
Minnesota affiliation lasted only one year. The lowly A's returned as the 
team's parent in 1964. Moreover, that season the Texas League placed a 
team in Fort Worth, and the Rangers reverted to their Dallas-only identity. 
The last Dallas Rangers club, managed by John McNamara, won only 53 of 
157 PCL games and drew only 39,000 fans. The franchise moved to Vancouver 
in 1965. The Dallas-Fort Worth regional name was then applied to the Texas 
League club, which played in Arlington and became known as the Spurs through 
1971. The old nickname Rangers was revived for the major league Texas Rangers,
