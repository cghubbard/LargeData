Lance William Niekro (born January 29, 1979) is a former Major League Baseball 
(MLB) player. Niekro appeared with the San Francisco Giants in several 
seasons between 2003 and 2007. He served as an assistant coach at Florida 
Southern College and was elevated to the head coach position on May 9, 
2012. He is the nephew of former MLB pitcher Phil Niekro and son of former 
MLB pitcher Joe Niekro. Niekro was drafted out of Florida Southern by the 
San Francisco Giants in the second round of the 2000 Major League Baseball 
draft. He began his professional career as a third baseman, but moved to 
first base in the minor leagues due to injury. Niekro first reached the 
major leagues in 2003, but only had five at bats. He saw more substantial 
playing time in 2005, when he split time with J. T. Snow at first base 
and played in 113 games, finishing the season with a .252 batting average, 
12 home runs, and 46 RBI in 278 at-bats. Following the 2005 season, Snow 
and the Giants parted ways. As a result, Niekro was given his shot as the 
everyday first baseman, but was sent back down to the minors. During the 
2006 season, his replacements were Mark Sweeney, Travis Ishikawa, Chad 
Santos and Shea Hillenbrand. On May 4, 2007, the Giants designated Niekro 
for assignment and recalled Scott Munter from Triple-A Fresno. He was later 
optioned to Fresno when no other team claimed him. He became a free agent 
after the season. Like his father and uncle, Niekro can throw a knuckleball, 
and was first allowed to pitch professionally for the Grizzlies in August 
2007. On January 10, 2008, the Houston Astros signed Niekro to a minor 
league contract with an invitation to spring training. He was released 
on May 2, 2008 and retired, getting a job with a telecommunications company.[1] 
On December 18, 2008, Niekro decided to make a comeback as a knuckleball 
pitcher and was signed by the Atlanta Braves to a minor league contract.[1][2] 
He pitched one season in the Braves' system, appearing in 14 games for 
the Gulf Coast League Braves in 2009 before becoming a free agent at the 
end of the year. In 2010, he was named an assistant coach at Florida Southern. 
On May 9, 2012, Niekro succeeded Tom Meyer as the head coach of Florida 
Southern Moccasins, a program that has produced the most NCAA Championships
