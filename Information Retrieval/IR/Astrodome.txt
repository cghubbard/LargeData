Houston Astrodome or simply The Astrodome, is the world's first multi-purpose, 
domed sports stadium, located in Houston, Texas. Construction on the stadium 
began in 1962, and it officially opened in 1965. It served as the second 
home to the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB) from its opening 
in 1965 until 1999, and the home to the Houston Oilers of the National 
Football League (NFL) from 1968 until 1996, and also the part-time home 
of the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 
1971 until 1975. Additionally, the Astrodome was the primary venue of the 
Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo from 1966 until 2002. When opened, it 
was named the Harris County Domed Stadium and was nicknamed the "Eighth 
Wonder of the World".[5] While originally utilizing a natural grass playing 
surface, the Astrodome became the first major sports venue to feature artificial 
turf, which became known as AstroTurf. In another technological first, 
the Astrodome featured the "Astrolite", which was the first animated scoreboard. 
The Astrodome received considerable renovations in 1988 that significantly 
expanded seating, and altered many original features. The Astrodome's primary 
tenants have since moved to other, newly constructed venues; the Astros 
moved to Minute Maid Park, while Houston Texans—the successor to the Houston 
Oilers—began play nextdoor at the NRG Stadium. In 2005, the Astrodome was 
used as a shelter for residents of New Orleans affected by Hurricane Katrina. 
The venue regularly hosted events until it was declared non-compliant with 
fire code by the Houston Fire Department in 2008. Parts of it were demolished 
in 2013 after several years of disuse. In 2014 it was listed on the National 
Register of Historic Places.[1] Major League Baseball expanded to Houston 
in 1960 when the National League agreed to add two teams. The Houston Colt 
.45s (renamed the Astros in 1965) were to begin play in 1962, along with 
their expansion brethren New York Mets. Roy Hofheinz, a former mayor of 
Houston, and his group were granted the franchise after they promised to 
build a covered stadium. It was thought a covered stadium was a must for 
a major league team to be viable in Houston due to the area's subtropical 
climate and hot summers. Game-time temperatures are usually above 97 °F 
(36 °C) in July and August, with high humidity and a likelihood of rain. 
Hofheinz claimed inspiration for what became the Astrodome when he was 
on a tour of Rome, where he learned that the builders of the ancient Colosseum 
installed giant velaria to shield spectators from the Roman sun. The Astrodome 
was conceived by Hofheinz as early as 1952, when he and his daughter Dede 
were rained out once too often at Buffalo Stadium, home of Houston's minor 
league baseball team, the Houston Buffs. Hofheinz abandoned his interest 
in the world's first air-conditioned shopping mall, The Galleria, and set 
his sights on bringing major league baseball to Houston.[6] The Astrodome 
was designed by architects Hermon Lloyd & W. B. Morgan, and Wilson, Morris, 
Crain and Anderson (Morris Architects). Structural engineering and structural 
design was performed by Walter P Moore Engineers and Consultants of Houston. 
It was constructed by H. A. Lott, Inc. for Harris County, Texas. It stands 
18 stories tall, covering 9.5 acres (3.8 ha). The dome is 710 feet (220 m) 
in diameter and the ceiling is 208 feet (63 m) above the playing surface, 
which itself sits 25 feet (7.6 m) below street level.[7] The scoreboard, 
eventually known as the "Astrolite", was designed by Fair Play Scoreboards 
of Des Moines, Iowa.[8] Having designed the scoreboard for Dodger Stadium 
several years prior, team owner Roy Hofheinz was not impressed with the 
initial proposal for a much more generic type of scoreboard. Project designer 
Jack Foster teamed up with a creative professional based in Kansas City 
to create the first animated scoreboard. Its reported cost was $2.1 million.[8] 
The Dome was completed in November 1964, six months ahead of schedule.[9] 
Many engineering changes were required during construction, including the 
modest flattening of the supposed "hemispherical roof" to cope with environmentally 
induced structural deformation and the use of a new paving process called 
"lime stabilization" to cope with changes in the chemistry of the soil. 
The air conditioning system was designed by Houston mechanical engineers 
Israel A. Naman and Jack Boyd Buckley of I. A. Naman + Associates. The 
multi-purpose stadium, designed to facilitate both football and baseball, 
is nearly circular and uses movable lower seating areas. It also ushered 
in the era of other fully domed stadiums, such as the Pontiac Silverdome 
near Detroit and the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, as well as 
the now-demolished Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome (now rebuilt as U.S. Bank 
Stadium) in Minneapolis, Kingdome in Seattle, and RCA Dome in Indianapolis. 
To test what effect the enclosed air-conditioned environment might have 
on the delivery of breaking balls, Satchel Paige, in full Astros uniform, 
threw the first pitches at the Astrodome on February 7, 1965.[10][11] He 
later concluded that it was a "pitcher's paradise", as the lack of wind 
allowed for sensitive pitches to maneuver more easily. Hofheinz had an 
opulent apartment in the Dome, which was removed when the facility was 
remodeled in 1988.[12] On Opening Day, April 9, 1965, a sold-out crowd 
of 47,879 watched an exhibition game between the Houston Astros and the 
New York Yankees. President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird were 
in attendance, as well as Texas Governor John Connally and Houston Mayor 
Louie Welch. Governor Connally tossed out the first ball for the first 
game ever played indoors. Dick "Turk" Farrell of the Astros threw the first 
pitch. Mickey Mantle had both the first hit (a single) and the first home 
run in the Astrodome. The Astros beat the Yankees that night, 2-1.[13] 
President Johnson stopped at the Astrodome that evening en route to his 
home in Johnson City and paid his respects to baseball and Astros president 
Roy Hofheinz, a campaign manager for Johnson in the 1940s, just as the 
second inning got underway. He and Lady Bird watched the opening night 
game from behind the glass in Judge Hofheinz' private box high in right 
field just to the right of the giant scoreboard. LBJ ate hors d'œuvres 
and chicken and ice cream while watching the game.[13] "Roy, I want to 
congratulate you; it shows so much imagination", he was heard to say. Later, 
he called the stadium "massive" and "beautiful." Although the president's 
visit overshadowed all others, dignitaries swarmed through the "Eighth 
Wonder of the World" during the three days of the exhibition series and 
for opening night against the Phillies.[14][15] The first artist to play 
the Astrodome was Judy Garland on December 17, 1965, where she was paid 
$43,000 for the one show. The Supremes were her opening act and tickets 
were priced $1.00 to $7.50. The dome seated 48,000, with another 12,000 
seats added for this show. Garland appeared on stage at 10 p.m. and sang 
for 40 minutes, with her set of songs including: "He's Got The Whole World 
In His Hands"; "Just In Time"; "My Kind Of Town, Houston Is"/"Houston"; 
"As Long As He Needs Me"; "Joey, Joey, Joey"; "Do It Again"; "What Now 
My Love?"; "By Myself"; "Rock-A-Bye Your Baby"; "San Francisco"; "Chicago"; 
and "Over The Rainbow." Mort Lindsey conducted.[16] Ironically, the Astrodome 
suffered a rainout on June 15, 1976. The Astros' scheduled game against 
the Pittsburgh Pirates was called when massive flooding in the Houston 
area prevented all but a few fans from reaching the stadium. Both teams 
had arrived early for practice, but the umpires were several hours late. 
At 5pm that day, with only a handful of fans on hand and already several 
hours behind, the umpires and teams agreed to call the game off. Tables 
were brought onto the field and the teams ate dinner together.[17] Although 
the Astros still had a home series with Pittsburgh in August, this game 
was made up in Pittsburgh in July. In 1989, four cylindrical pedestrian 
ramp columns were constructed outside the Dome for accessibility. This 
enabled the Astrodome to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act 
of 1990. The 1992 Republican National Convention was held at the Astrodome 
in August of that year. The Astros accommodated the convention by taking 
a month-long road trip. On August 19, 1995, a scheduled preseason game 
between the Oilers and the San Diego Chargers had to be canceled due to 
the dilapidated condition of the playing field. Oilers owner Bud Adams 
demanded a new stadium, but the city of Houston refused to fund it. After 
years of threats, Adams moved the team to Tennessee after the 1996 season.[18] 
Around that time the Astros also threatened to leave the city unless a 
new ballpark was built.[18] The retractable-roofed Enron Field (now known 
as Minute Maid Park) opened for the 2000 season in downtown Houston. One 
of the largest crowds in the Astrodome's history, more than 66,746 fans, 
came on Sunday, February 26, 1995, to see Tejano superstar Selena and her 
band Los Dinos perform for a sell-out crowd during the Houston Livestock 
Show and Rodeo.[19] Selena y Los Dinos performed two consecutive times 
before at the Astrodome, breaking previous attendance records each time. 
This was Selena's last televised concert before she was fatally shot on 
March 31, 1995 by her fan club president. The Astrodome was joined by a 
new neighbor in 2002, the retractable-roofed Reliant Stadium, which was 
built to house Houston's new NFL franchise, the Houston Texans. The Houston 
Livestock Show and Rodeo moved to the new venue in 2003, leaving the Astrodome 
without any major tenants. The last concert performed at the Astrodome 
was George Strait & the Ace in the Hole Band in February 2003, whose performance 
was recorded in For the Last Time: Live from the Astrodome.[20] On August 
31, 2005, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the Harris County Department 
of Homeland Security and Emergency Management and the State of Louisiana 
came to an agreement to allow at least 25,000 evacuees from New Orleans, 
especially those that were sheltered in the Louisiana Superdome, to move 
to the Astrodome until they could return home. The evacuation began on 
September 1, 2005. All scheduled events for the final four months of 2005 
at the Astrodome were cancelled.[21] Overflow refugees were held in the 
surrounding Reliant Park complex. There was a full field hospital inside 
the Reliant Arena, which cared for the entire Katrina evacuee community. 
The entire Reliant Park complex was scheduled to be emptied of hurricane 
evacuees by September 17, 2005. Originally, the Astrodome was planned to 
be used to house evacuees until December. However, the surrounding parking 
lots were needed for the first Houston Texans home game. Arrangements were 
made to help Katrina evacuees find apartments both in Houston and elsewhere 
in the United States. By September 16, 2005, the last of the hurricane 
evacuees living in the Astrodome had been moved out either to the neighboring 
Reliant Arena or to permanent housing north of Houston.[22] As of September 
20, 2005, the remaining Katrina evacuees were relocated to Arkansas due 
to Hurricane Rita.[23] In 2008, the facility was cited for numerous code 
violations. Since then, only maintenance workers and security guards have 
been allowed to enter the stadium while it is brought up to code.[24] The 
city council rejected demolition plans on environmental grounds, over concerns 
that demolition of the Dome might damage the dense development that today 
closely surrounds it.[25] Houston's plan to host the 2012 Summer Olympics 
included renovating the Astrodome for use as a main stadium.[26] Houston 
became one of the USOC's bid finalists, but the organization chose New 
York City as its candidate city and the Games were ultimately awarded to 
London by the IOC. Plans to convert the Astrodome into a luxury hotel were 
rejected.[27] A proposal to convert the Astrodome into a movie production 
studio was also considered but rejected.[28] Regardless of the type of 
renovation, all renovation plans must deal with the problem of occupancy 
code violations that have basically shuttered the Astrodome for the near 
future.[29] In June 2013, a comprehensive plan was unveiled that would 
have seen the aging structure undergo an almost $200 million renovation 
into a multi-purpose event/convention facility. The measure would have 
to have been approved first through a bond election in Harris County for 
the publicly funded project to go forward or else, officials warned, the 
iconic structure would be demolished.[30] Voters ended up rejecting the 
measure on November 5, 2013.[31] On November 5, 2013, voters in Houston 
turned down a $213 million referendum to renovate and convert the Astrodome 
into a state-of-the-art convention center and exhibition space known as 
"New Dome Experience".[32] Until a final disposition is made, Harris County 
commissioners will not approve demolition of the stadium. "The building's 
still there. There's no formal plan or authorization to demolish the building, 
and until somebody brings such a plan to fruition, there's a chance", according 
to Willie Loston, executive director of the Harris County Sports and Convention 
Corporation. "The proposal was rejected by the voters. We're back to where 
we were. Square one", according to Steve Radack, Harris County commissioner.[33] 
Three exterior pedestrian ramp towers were demolished on December 8, 2013. 
Around that time, the ramp bridges were disconnected from the main structure 
and the surrounding grass berms were lowered. The ticket booths were also 
removed along with the interior seats. The demolition was planned prior 
to the referendum.[34][35] After the failed bond election of 2013, the 
county went back to the drawing board and in August 2014 the County Commissioners 
Court announced a new plan to save and rejuvenate the Astrodome. The new 
concept centers around leaving the Dome's roof intact and converting the 
Astrodome's vast central space into a covered semi-climate-controlled city 
park that could have flexible uses for both public recreation and gatherings 
such as festivals and concerts. The remainder of the complex would be redeveloped 
over time using a combination of public and private funds and include elements 
such as an educational exploration area to encourage students to learn 
about the sciences and engineering and possibly meeting, exhibition, and 
restaurant areas that would not only serve the general public, but could 
also add value to the Houston Texans' Game Day Experiences and be used 
by the Rodeo. A key element of this proposal centered around the ability 
for the County to proceed with the initial phases of the project using 
existing funds without having to seek voter approval for an expensive bond 
referendum.[36] However, this plan failed as well. After the failed plans 
of past years, the Astrodome Revitalization Project was proposed in September 
2016. This plan would turn the dome into a massive underground parking 
garage. Specifically, the first step would raise the dome floor and use 
the space underneath that as parking, leaving the floor above for other 
uses. On September 27, 2016, the Harris County Commissioners approved the 
first part of the plan. This marked a major turning point for the dome 
as some feared if the plan wasn't approved the building would be demolished.[37][38][39] 
The Astrodome held several motorsports events throughout its lifetime. 
The AMA Grand National Championship held events starting in 1968 and running 
for 18 years, utilizing the Short Track and TT Steeplechase track configurations 
in their visits. The AMA Supercross Championship held its first ever indoor 
Supercross at the Astrodome in 1974, won by Jim Pomeroy. In the mid-1980s 
the Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group held several Stadium Off-Road Racing 
Series events, showcasing such drivers as Ivan Stewart, Robby Gordon, and 
Walker Evans. Beginning in the early 80s both TNT Motorsports and the United 
States Hot Rod Association held events showcasing mud bogging, truck and 
tractor pulling, and monster trucks in the Astrodome. After a buy-out of 
TNT Motorsports, the USHRA continued holding events that would later transform 
into the current Monster Jam events. With the opening of NRG Stadium in 
late 2002, the events held in early 2002 by AMA Supercross and Monster 
Jam would be their last in the Astrodome before moving next door for 2003, 
where they continue to hold events every year. The Astrodome was well-renowned 
for a four-story scoreboard called the "Astrolite", composed of thousands 
of light bulbs that featured numerous animations. After every Astros home 
run, the scoreboard featured a minute-long animated celebration of pistols, 
bulls, and fireworks. The scoreboard remained intact until 1988 when Houston 
Oilers (now Tennessee Titans) owner Bud Adams suggested the removal of 
the scoreboard to accommodate increased capacity demands for football, 
baseball and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. Harris County spent 
$67 million of public funds on renovations.[45] Approximately 15,000 new 
seats resembling the 1970s rainbow uniform pattern were installed to bring 
seating capacity to almost 60,000 for football. On September 5, 1988, a 
final celebration commemorating the scoreboard occurred prior to expansion 
renovations. Originally, the stadium's surface was a Tifway 419 Bermuda 
grass playing surface specifically bred for indoor use. The dome's ceiling 
contained numerous semitransparent panes made of Lucite. Players quickly 
complained that glare coming off of the panes made it hard for them to 
track fly balls. To solve the problem, two sections of panes were painted 
white. However, within a few months, the grass died from lack of sunlight.[46] 
For most of the 1965 season, the Astros played on green-painted dirt and 
dead grass. The clear panels also added a problem when combined with the 
natural grass. The grass tended to hold, then release moisture, often resulting 
in rain within the structure, causing games to be delayed while the grounds 
crews cleaned up the playing surface. The solution was to install a new 
type of artificial grass on the field, ChemGrass, which became known as 
AstroTurf. Because the supply of AstroTurf was still low, only a limited 
amount was available at the start of the season. There was not enough for 
the entire outfield, so the first phase covered only the traditional grass 
portion of the infield and foul territory,[47] at a cost of $2 per square 
foot. It was installed in time to test out during exhibition games against 
the Dodgers in March.[48][49][50] The outfield remained painted dirt until 
after the 1966 All-Star Game. The team was sent on an extended road trip 
before the break, and on July 19, 1966, the installation of the outfield 
portion of AstroTurf was completed for a game with the Phillies.[51] Groundskeepers 
dressed as astronauts kept the turf clean with vacuum cleaners between 
innings. The infield dirt remained in the traditional design, with a large 
dirt arc, similar to natural grass fields. In 1973, the Astros installed 
an all-AstroTurf infield, except for dirt cutouts around the bases. This 
"sliding pit" configuration was first introduced by Cincinnati with the 
opening of Riverfront Stadium on June 30, 1970. It was then installed in 
the new stadiums in Philadelphia in 1971, and Kansas City in 1973. The 
artificial turf fields of Pittsburgh, St. Louis and San Francisco were 
traditionally configured like the Astrodome, and also changed to sliding 
pits in the 1970s. Rogers Centre in Toronto was the last park in the majors 
that had the sliding pits; they switched to a dirt infield in 2016. Throughout 
its history, the Astrodome was known as a pitcher's park. The power alleys 
were never shorter than 370 feet (113 m) from the plate; on at least two 
occasions they were as far as 390 feet (119 m). Over time, it gave up fewer 
home runs than any other park in the National League.[6] The Astrodome's 
reputation as a pitcher's park continued even in the mid-1980s, when the 
fences were moved in closer than the Metrodome, which was long reckoned 
as a hitter's park. The seating capacity for baseball has been as follows:
