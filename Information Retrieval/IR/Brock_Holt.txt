Brock Wyatt Holt (born June 11, 1988) is an American professional baseball 
utility player for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball. While primarily 
used as an outfielder, Holt has started in and played at every position 
for the Red Sox, except for pitcher and catcher. He stands at 5'10" and 
weighs 180 lbs. Holt graduated in 2006 from Stephenville High School in 
Texas. In 2003, his freshman year, he made the District 8-4A All-District 
baseball team despite batting just .227, and shared the league's Newcomer 
of the Year award.[1] Holt was a second-team All-District 8-4A inclusion 
his sophomore year, batting .324 for the season.[2] In 2005, Holt was named 
defensive player of the year in District 6-4a,[3] and he earned all-district 
honors in 2006, his senior year.[4] Holt attended Navarro College in 2007 
and 2008. After transferring to Rice University in 2009, he posted a .348 
batting average with 12 home runs and 43 RBIs in 59 games for the Rice 
Owls. He also led the Owls with 67 runs scored and shared the team lead 
with 11 stolen bases. In the same season, he was named both to the All-NCAA 
Regional Team and the All-Silver Glove Trophy Series team.[5] Holt was 
drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates with the club's ninth round selection 
in the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft, one pick before Rice teammate 
Ryan Berry.[6] Holt began his professional career with the Pittsburgh Pirates' 
short season, Class-A affiliate, the State College Spikes, before advancing 
to the High-A Bradenton Marauders in 2010. His 2010 season was cut short 
due to injury to his medial collateral ligament, which required surgery.[7] 
He began the 2011 season with the Pirates' Double-A affiliate, the Altoona 
Curve. On July 13, 2011, Holt was named the MVP of the Eastern League All-Star 
Game after hitting a two-run homer in the ninth inning.[8] Holt opened 
2012 with Altoona and later joined Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. He was 
promoted to the Pittsburgh Pirates from the minors as the major league 
rosters expanded on September 1. Holt made his Major League debut on September 
1, 2012. At the time of his promotion, he had hit a .322 average in 102 
games with Altoona and .432 in 24 games for Indianapolis.[9] On September 
4, against the Houston Astros, Holt became only the second Pirates player 
since 1900 to have a four-hit game within his first four career games in 
the majors. The only other Pirates player to have a four-hit game so early 
in his career was Jack Merson, who went 4-for-5 in his second major league 
game on September 15, 1951.[10] In 24 games, Holt batted .292 with a triple 
and 3 RBI. On December 26, 2012 he was traded to the Boston Red Sox (along 
with Joel Hanrahan) for Jerry Sands, Stolmy Pimentel, Mark Melancon and 
Iván DeJesús, Jr..[11] Holt started the 2013 season with the Triple-A Pawtucket 
Red Sox. He debuted for Boston after getting called up on July 6 in Anaheim. 
In 2013, Holt played in 26 games, hitting .203 with 11 RBI. Holt received 
his first championship ring when the Red Sox won the World Series over 
the St. Louis Cardinals, despite not playing in the postseason. Holt again 
started 2014 in Triple-A, but was called up May 17 after an injury to Will 
Middlebrooks and hit leadoff for the rest of the season. On May 31, 2014, 
against the Tampa Bay Rays at Fenway Park, Brock Holt hit his first Major 
League home run. On June 8, 2014, in order to allow Xander Bogaerts to 
play 3rd base, Holt moved to left field. He immediately impressed, making 
a sensational catch on the warning track to rob Ian Kinsler of a hit. On 
July 9, 2014, against the Chicago White Sox, Holt drove in Daniel Nava 
in the bottom of the 9th for the first walk-off hit of his career. By the 
end of the season, Holt had started games at every position except pitcher 
and catcher.[12] In 2015, Holt made the opening day roster for the first 
time. On June 16, 2015, Holt hit for the cycle against the Atlanta Braves 
at Fenway Park. He doubled, singled, and homered off of Julio Teherán, 
and completed it with a triple in the 8th off of Sugar Ray Marimón. In 
doing so, he became the first Red Sox player to accomplish the feat in 
19 years, since John Valentin in 1996.[13] On July 6, Holt was chosen to 
represent the Red Sox in the 2015 Major League Baseball All-Star Game by 
Kansas City Royals manager Ned Yost.[14] Holt is the first player ever 
to be selected to the All Star Game after starting at seven or more positions 
before the break.[15] Following the announcement that Wade Boggs number 
26 was to be retired, Holt switched to jersey number 12 in 2016.[16] On 
May 19, Holt suffered a concussion and was placed on the Disabled List. 
On August 24, Holt returned to the Red Sox, covering third base. At the 
end of the season Brock Holt finished with a batting average of .255.[17] 
In the 2016 American League Division Series between the Red Sox and Indians, 
Holt was named the starting third baseman over Travis Shaw. He batted .400 
with a home run and an RBI as Cleveland swept Boston in three games. Holt
