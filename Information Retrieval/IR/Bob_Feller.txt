Robert William Andrew Feller (November 3, 1918 – December 15, 2010), nicknamed 
"The Heater from Van Meter", "Bullet Bob", and "Rapid Robert", was an American 
baseball pitcher who played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 
the Cleveland Indians. Feller pitched from 1936 to 1941 and from 1945 to 
1956, interrupted only by a four-year sojourn in the Navy. In a career 
spanning 570 games, Feller pitched 3,827 innings and posted a win–loss 
record of 266–162, with 279 complete games, 44 shutouts, and a 3.25 earned 
run average (ERA). A prodigy who bypassed the minor leagues, Feller first 
played for the Indians at the age of 17. His career was interrupted by 
four years of military service in World War II, during which time he served 
as Chief Petty Officer aboard the USS Alabama. Feller became the first 
pitcher to win 24 games in a season before the age of 21. During his career, 
he threw no-hitters in 1940, 1946, and 1951. Feller also recorded 12 one-hitters 
(his no-hitters and one-hitters were records at the time of his retirement). 
He helped the Indians win a World Series title in 1948 and an American 
League-record 111 wins and the pennant in 1954. Feller led the American 
League in wins six times and in strikeouts seven times. In 1946, he recorded 
348 strikeouts, a total not exceeded for 19 years. An eight-time All-Star, 
Feller was ranked 36th on Sporting News's list of the 100 Greatest Baseball 
Players and was named the publication's "greatest pitcher of his time". 
He was a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. 
Baseball Hall of Fame member Ted Williams called Feller "the fastest and 
best pitcher I ever saw during my career."[1] Hall of Famer Stan Musial 
believed he was "probably the greatest pitcher of our era."[1] He was inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 on his first ballot appearance; 
at the time only three players ever had a higher percentage of ballot votes. 
He was elected the inaugural President of the Major League Baseball Players' 
Association and participated in exhibition games which featured players 
from both the Major and Negro Leagues. Feller died at the age of 92 in 
2010. Feller was born and raised with his sister, Marguerite, in Van Meter, 
Iowa. His father, William, ran the 360-acre (150 ha) family farm, and his 
mother, Lena (Forret), was a teacher and registered nurse.[2]:6[3][4]:4 
Feller played catch daily with his father. He had learned to throw a curveball 
by the time he was eight years old, and could throw a ball 270 feet (82 m) 
when he was nine.[2]:11 To assist his son, Feller senior started growing 
wheat on his farm, a less labor-intensive crop than corn, to allow his 
son more time to play baseball.[5] Originally the Fellers were Roman Catholics 
but converted to Methodism after Feller's father was reprimanded by their 
parish priest for letting him play on Sundays.[5] Feller later suggested 
that his arm strength and ball speed during his major league career came 
from his childhood work milking cows, picking corn, and baling hay.[3][6] 
He recalled his childhood fondly: "What kid wouldn't enjoy the life I led 
in Iowa? Baseball and farming, and I had the best of both worlds."[7]:32 
The family's farm is on the National Register of Historic Places.[8] Feller 
began to play American Legion Baseball in the nearby town of Adel at the 
age of 10;[9] the following year, his father built a baseball diamond on 
the farm. The diamond was named Oak View Park and included a pitching mound, 
scoreboard and concessions area.[2]:16[5] Feller and other players formed 
a team, the Oakviews, consisting of semi-pro and high school ballplayers.[2]:16[4]:5 
Feller played primarily as a shortstop or outfielder, and emulated Rogers 
Hornsby's batting stance.[2]:13 From the age of 15, he began to pitch for 
the Oakviews after a starting pitcher was injured; while doing so, Feller 
continued to play American Legion baseball. His catcher during this period 
was Nile Kinnick, who later became a member of the College Football Hall 
of Fame.[2]:20 A student at Van Meter High School, Feller was a starting 
pitcher for the school's baseball team. During this time he continued to 
play on the Farmers Union team in the American Amateur Baseball Congress, 
and had 19 wins and four losses for Farmers Union one season.[4]:4[7]:37 
He also was the starting center for the high school basketball team.[2]:29 
By the age of 16, Feller possessed what critics judged a high quality fastball; 
major league scouts traveled to Dayton, Ohio to watch him in the annual 
national baseball tournament. After the game, several big league clubs 
offered signing bonuses with their contract offers, but he had already 
been signed to a professional contract with the Cleveland Indians.[2]:25–26 
In 1936, Feller was signed by Cy Slapnicka, a scout for the Indians, for 
one dollar and an autographed baseball.[2]:27 While scouting Feller, Slapnicka 
said, "This was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. 
His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it would 
wiggle and shoot around. I didn't know then that he was smart and had the 
heart of a lion, but I knew that I was looking at an arm the likes of which 
you see only once in a lifetime."[10]:375 Feller was assigned to the Fargo-Moorhead 
Twins and was to report there after finishing the high school semester.[2]:30 
Slapnicka was later named general manager of the Indians and transferred 
Feller's contract from Fargo-Moorhead to the New Orleans Pelicans. He was 
planning to add Feller, along with outfielder Tommy Henrich, to the major 
league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games without visiting 
either farm club. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major 
League Baseball's rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams 
could sign amateur baseball players to contracts. After a three-month investigation, 
concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major 
League Baseball rules by signing Feller, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain 
Landis disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president 
Alva Bradley, but awarded both Feller and Henrich free agency and required 
the club to pay a $7,500 fine.[10]:375 Landis made the decision partly 
due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play 
for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court.[5] 
Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the New York 
Yankees. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, "For $7500 the Cleveland 
Indians received $500,000 worth of publicity. ... I feel pretty sure Mr. 
Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, will admit this is the cheapest 
investment he ever made in publicity."[11] Feller joined the Indians and 
made his Major League debut on July 19, 1936 in a relief appearance against 
the Washington Senators. A month later on August 23, Feller made his first 
career start against the St. Louis Browns. Indians manager Steve O'Neill 
had Denny Galehouse warmed up in the bullpen in case the 17-year-old Feller 
had early troubles, but he struck out all three batters he faced in the 
first inning, and recorded 15 strikeouts in earning his first career win. 
His strikeout total was the highest for a (starting) pitching debut.[5][12] 
Two weeks later, he struck out 17 batters,[5] tying a single-game strikeout 
record previously set by Dizzy Dean, in a win over the Philadelphia Athletics. 
He finished the season with a 5–3 record, having appeared in 14 games; 
he had 47 walks and 76 strikeouts in 62 innings.[13] Feller's fame reached 
such a level that when he returned to Van Meter for his senior year of 
high school, the governor of Iowa greeted him.[14] His record-setting rookie 
year made him, according to baseball writer Richard Goldstein, "the best-known 
young person in America, with the possible exception of Shirley Temple."[14] 
Feller's entrance to the big leagues was later described: It is difficult 
to imagine now what a marvel Feller was when he burst upon the scene in 
1936, a callow youth of 17. Many athletes are great. Bob Feller was seminal. 
In the long-ago time, unlike nowadays, it was unheard of for teenagers 
to succeed in the big top of athletics. Children politely waited their 
turn in the sunshine. Perhaps in all the world only Sonja Henie had previously 
excelled at so young an age in any sport that mattered, and, after all, 
she was but a little girl wearing tights and fur trim, performing dainty 
figure eights. Feller dressed in the uniform of the major league Cleveland 
Indians, striking out – fanning! – American demigods ... in the only professional 
team sport that mattered then in the United States. As the 1937 season 
began, Feller appeared on the cover of the April 19, 1937 issue of Time 
magazine.[15] In his first appearance of the season on April 24, Feller 
suffered an injury to his elbow while throwing a curveball. He spent April 
and May healing the arm, and in May graduated from high school; the ceremony 
aired nationally on NBC Radio.[2]:69[16][17] In mid-May, the Indians considered 
ending Feller's season early. "We're not taking any chances on that arm 
and we're not going to allow him to pitch again until the last trace of 
soreness has disappeared", said Slapnicka.[18] On May 18 Feller appeared 
in his first game since April 24 but did not record an out. He did not 
pitch again until June 22, when he recorded two innings, then returned 
to normal pitching duties on July 4.[19] On October 2, 1938, Feller was 
the starting pitcher against the Detroit Tigers. Detroit's Hank Greenberg 
was two home runs short of Babe Ruth's then-single-season record of 60 
home runs. By the ninth inning, Feller had recorded 16 strikeouts, one 
fewer than the MLB record in a nine-inning game. He tied the record when 
he struck out Detroit's Pete Fox and passed it, to set a modern major league 
record of 18 strikeouts, when he struck out Chet Laabs for the fifth time 
that day. Greenberg said, "Feller's curve was jumping wickedly and with 
that and his fast ball, he was murder."[20] Feller did not earn a win, 
however, as the Indians lost, 4–1. "It was one of those days when everything 
feels perfect, your arm, your coordination, your concentration, everything. 
There was drama in the air because of Greenberg's attempt to break Ruth's 
record, and the excitement grew even greater when my strikeouts started 
to add up", Feller said.[21][22] For the 1938 season, Feller led all pitchers 
with 208 walks and 240 strikeouts.[13] In 1939, Feller received his first 
career Opening Day start against the Tigers after a match against the Browns 
was rained out. He won the game 5–1, after allowing three hits.[2]:84 On 
Mother's Day, Feller pitched against the Chicago White Sox with his family 
in attendance. One pitch was fouled off by Marv Owen into the seats and 
into the face of Feller's mother; he went on to win the game.[23] Feller 
finished the 1939 season having led the AL in wins (24), complete games 
(24) and innings pitched (296.2) and led the majors for a second consecutive 
year in both walks (142) and strikeouts (246).[24][25] Opening Day of the 
1940 season featured a no-hitter from Feller against the Chicago White 
Sox. Feller was assisted by Indians second baseman Ray Mack when he made 
a diving play to record the final out.[26] This is the only no-hitter to 
be thrown on Opening Day in major league history. He followed his no-hitter 
with a six-run, three-inning performance in his next start, however, in 
a game against the Detroit Tigers.[27] By the end of the season he had 
a 27–11 record, his win total the best in the majors that season and a 
career-high for Feller.[13] He accomplished a pitching triple crown for 
the 1940 season as he led the AL in ERA (2.61), wins (27) and strikeouts 
(261) (the latter two led the entire majors).[28] Feller also led the majors 
with 31 complete games and 320.1 innings pitched, and won the Sporting 
News Player of the Year Award.[13] Feller later assessed his first few 
years in the majors: "I relied on the catcher too much. It's swell to have 
a good catcher calling 'em for you, but the pitcher should take responsibility 
on his own shoulders."[29] Due to Feller's pitching speed, Lew Fonseca 
was commissioned by the Office of the Commissioner to pit Feller's fastball 
against a Harley-Davidson motorcycle in a speed trial. The test was conducted 
in Chicago's Lincoln Park and required Feller to hit a target 12 inches 
(300 mm) in diameter, 60 feet 6 inches (18.44 m) away. The motorcycle passed 
Feller going 86 miles per hour (138 km/h) and with a 10 foot (3.0 m) head 
start but the ball beat the bike to the target by three feet (0.91 m). 
Feller's throw was calculated at the time to have reached 98.6 mph (158.7 km/h), 
and later 104 mph (167 km/h) using updated measuring methods.[4]:27[5][21] 
Feller again led the majors in wins (25), strikeouts (260), innings pitched 
(343), and walks (194) for the 1941 season. His six shutouts were an AL-best 
on the season.[13] That year, Joe DiMaggio talked about Feller's pitching 
ability, stating "I don't think anyone is ever going to throw a ball faster 
than he does. And his curveball isn't human."[14] Feller appeared in the 
May 12, 1941, edition of Life, which said: "... he is unquestionably the 
idol of several generations of Americans, ranging in age from 7 to 70. 
They represent of city, town, and village in the land, speak of him familiarly 
as 'Bob', and talk about him by the hour, with enthusiasm."[30] The United 
States entered World War II with the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 
7, 1941. Feller heard about the bombing while returning from a visit to 
his terminally ill father at Des Moines to Chicago where he was to sign 
a new Indians contract.[5] Two days later, he volunteered for the United 
States Navy, becoming the first American professional athlete to enlist.[31] 
Originally he tried to enlist as a fighter pilot but failed hearing tests. 
Feller attended basic training at Norfolk Naval Base and served as a physical 
fitness instructor there. He also pitched in baseball games hosted by the 
military. Although he had received a military exemption owing to his father's 
failing health, he wanted to serve in combat missions.[32] Feller said, 
"I told them I wanted to ... get into combat; wanted to do something besides 
standing around handing out balls and bats and making ball fields out of 
coral reefs."[33] Feller was assigned to the USS Alabama;[8] he had hoped 
to serve on the USS Iowa, but nearly all servicemen from Iowa had requested 
a place on that ship, and Feller was not selected.[2]:119 Shortly before 
Feller left for combat, his father died of brain cancer in early January 
1943. Five days later he married Virginia Winther whom he met while in 
Florida for spring training; she was a student at Rollins College.[12] 
After the marriage, Feller returned to service as Gun Captain aboard the 
Alabama and kept his pitching arm in shape by throwing near a gun turret.[34] 
Feller and the Alabama crew spent most of 1943 in the British Isles along 
with USS South Dakota, but in August were reassigned to the Pacific Theater 
of Operations.[2]:119 Feller's first taste of direct combat was at Operation 
Galvanic in November 1943. The Alabama also served during Operation Flintlock 
while primarily being used as an escort battleship in 1944. Feller participated 
in the Battle of the Philippine Sea before his combat duty ended in January 
1945; he spent the rest of the war at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station 
as an instructor.[2]:124–127 When the war ended, Feller was discharged 
as a Chief Petty Officer on August 22, 1945.[12] Feller was decorated with 
six campaign ribbons and eight battle stars while serving on missions in 
both the Pacific and North Atlantic, and he was made an honorary member 
of the Green Berets later in life.[4]:xiii[12] Upon arrival in Cleveland 
after his discharge, Feller was honored with a civic luncheon on August 
24, 1945, with more than 1,000 people in attendance at the Carter Hotel. 
Feller said to the crowd: "The real heroes didn't come home."[12][34] Later 
that day, the city held a parade and Feller was the starting pitcher in 
the Indians' game against the Detroit Tigers. Feller allowed four hits 
in the game and earned a win in the Indians' 4–2 victory. "I was so tired 
from all the receptions I didn't know if I could finish the game", Feller 
said.[12] For the 1945 season, he appeared in nine games and notched a 
5–3 record with 59 strikeouts and 2.50 ERA.[13] Before the 1946 season, 
Feller signed a $50,000 contract for the year, including a bonus for attendance, 
as the Indians felt many were attending baseball games primarily to see 
him; he was offered $100,000 by Jorge Pasquel to play in the Mexican League, 
but declined to leave the States again.[2]:136 Feller recorded his second 
career no-hitter on April 30, 1946, against the New York Yankees. He allowed 
five walks and struck out 11 Yankees.[35] Feller said of the game, "The 
no-hitter on opening day in Chicago is the one that gets all the attention. 
But my no-hitter at Yankee Stadium was against a much better team than 
the White Sox. There was no comparison. I had to pitch to Tommy Henrich, 
Charlie Keller and Joe DiMaggio in the ninth inning to get the Yankees 
out."[3] At one point during the season (as Feller thought he might be 
nearing Rube Waddell's AL record for strikeouts), Feller confirmed Waddell's 
record of 344 strikeouts with the AL office as opposed to 349.[36][a] In 
his last appearance of the season on September 29, Feller threw five strikeouts 
against the Detroit Tigers to set the then-AL single-season strikeout record.[37][38] 
During the 1946 season, he registered career-highs in strikeouts (348), 
games started (42) and games pitched (48), shutouts (10), complete games 
(36) and innings pitched (377.1)—all major league bests that season.[36][37][39] 
Feller finished 26–15 with an ERA of 2.18, the latter a career-low.[13][40] 
Nearly 20 years later, Feller recalled, "For the 1946 season, though, the 
Indians were so thin in pitching that Boudreau decided I was to pitch every 
fourth day, regardless of rainouts, open dates, or anything else."[36] 
Feller began 1947 by setting up a barnstorming tour, pitting his own selected 
team against a Negro league baseball team led by Satchel Paige. Feller's 
team included Stan Musial and Phil Rizzuto while Paige's included Buck 
O'Neil and Hilton Smith. They played in 22 games across the United States, 
and at the conclusion of the tour, each player had made nearly as much 
money as the St. Louis Cardinals made as a team for their 1946 World Series 
win.[2]:150–154 Against the St. Louis Browns in Feller's second start of 
the season, he extended his major league record for one-hitters when he 
recorded his ninth one-hit game in a shutout win on April 22.[41][42] In 
a June 13 game against the Philadelphia Athletics, having already amassed 
10 strikeouts through four innings, Feller fell from the mound, which rain 
had made slippery, and injured his back. "My fastball was never the same 
after that", Feller said.[12][41] He ended the season as the AL leader 
in wins (20) and shutouts (5), and led the majors in strikeouts (196) and 
innings pitched (299).[13] In 1948, the Indians had one of their finest 
seasons, though Feller experienced a season that had more ups and downs. 
Feller was selected to represent the AL All-Stars for the seventh time 
in his career in the 1948 All-Star Game but declined to play, feeling that 
his performance did not warrant selection as an All-Star. At one point 
he was winless for a month,[12] and by July 22, his record was 9–12. Lou 
Boudreau, the Indians' player-manager, declared "we sink or swim with Feller", 
and continued to pick him.[12] Feller proceeded to go 10–3 for the remainder 
of his appearances to finish the season with a record of 19–15, a league-leading 
164 strikeouts, and a 3.56 ERA.[13] The Indians won a one-game playoff 
against the Boston Red Sox to determine the team to represent the AL in 
the World Series; it was the first time the team had won the pennant since 
the 1920 season.[2]:201 Feller started Game One of the 1948 World Series 
against the NL-champion Boston Braves. In the eighth inning, Feller and 
Boudreau appeared to have picked off the Braves' Phil Masi as he attempted 
to steal a base, but umpire Bill Stewart ruled he was safe.[12] Masi scored 
the only run of the game on a Braves single. Despite surrendering just 
two hits on 85 pitches for the game, Feller and the Indians lost 1–0.[43] 
Later, photographs showed that Boudreau had tagged Masi out by two feet. 
Feller said, "Stewart was the only guy in the park who thought he was safe."[12] 
Feller was again named the starter in Game Five, which set an attendance 
record; the 86,288 fans in Cleveland was the then-largest attendance at 
a baseball game.[10]:432 The Braves put up three runs in the top of the 
first inning. The Indians came back to tie the game, but by the seventh 
inning the Braves regained the lead for good and Feller was removed from 
the game. He finished having allowed eight hits and seven earned runs.[2]:204 
Lemon won Game Six and gave the Indians their second World Series championship. 
After the Indians returned to Cleveland and were given a victory parade, 
Feller said, "This is as good as being President."[44] After taking a pay 
cut to start the 1949 season, Feller pitched on Opening Day against the 
St. Louis Browns. During the game, he injured his shoulder and missed the 
rest of April. His performances were mixed in the rest of the season and 
he finished the year with a 15-14 record and a 3.75 ERA.[2]:206–211 Before 
the 1950 season, Feller suggested to Indians management he take a pay cut, 
and did so. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg said, "He himself made 
the suggestion. In fact, he offered to take more than the 25 per cent maximum 
pay cut allowed. There was absolutely nothing to it. We all agreed quickly 
on the figure after Bob showed up yesterday."[45] In a win over the Detroit 
Tigers in the second game of a doubleheader, Feller became the 53rd pitcher 
to win 200 games.[10]:64 Throughout the year, players noted that his velocity 
had returned, and, winning games with finesse rather than power, he was 
again effective. He finished the year with 16 wins and a 3.43 ERA.[2]:215 
On July 1, 1951, Feller recorded his third career no-hitter against the 
Detroit Tigers.[3] "I was depending on my slider and I didn't begin to 
think of a no-hitter until about the seventh inning. I tried to keep it 
in the back of my mind, bearing down and concentrating on one hitter at 
a time", Feller said.[46] Feller was the third pitcher, after Larry Corcoran 
and Cy Young, to record three career no-hitters.[46] He became the first 
pitcher of the 1951 season to reach 20 wins after he pitched a shutout 
against the Washington Senators on August 21.[47] Along with Early Wynn 
and Mike Garcia, Feller reached the 20-win mark during the season; they 
were the first trio of pitchers on the same staff to earn 20 wins since 
1931.[10]:65 Feller was named the Sporting News Pitcher of the Year.[48] 
Feller started the 1952 season with three wins in his first five starts; 
one of the losses was an April 23 one-hitter against Bob Cain, who also 
allowed only one hit. Feller struggled for the rest of the season, and 
after an argument with an umpire over a strike call in late August, manager 
Al López shut Feller down for the season.[2]:227–230 He finished the season 
with a 9–13 record and a 4.74 ERA.[13] He improved the following year, 
winning 10 games and losing 7 in 25 starts after Lopez gave him extra days 
of rest between appearances.[2]:234 The Indians won 111 regular season 
games during 1954, beating an AL record previously held by the 1927 New 
York Yankees.[10]:67 The 35-year-old Feller finished 13–3 on the year, 
earning his 250th pitching victory in a May 23 win and his 2,500th career 
strikeout in a win on June 12.[10]:68 The Indians played against the New 
York Giants in the 1954 World Series, but unlike the 1948 Series, Feller 
did not make an appearance. The Indians were swept in four games by the 
Giants. Indians manager Al López said of not starting Feller, "I know Feller 
wanted to start one of the games in the 1954 World Series (when the Indians 
were swept by the New York Giants), though we never really talked about 
it ... If we had won the first or second game in New York, I was going 
to start Feller in Cleveland in the fourth game. But when we didn't (win 
either game in New York), why in the hell was I going to pitch Feller? 
He was the fifth starter on the club at that time, and wasn't the Feller 
he'd been (earlier in his career)."[49] In 1955, Feller spent part of the 
season as a starter, then was moved to the bullpen later in the season. 
He won and lost four games each in 25 appearances.[13] During the offseason, 
he became chairman of the Ohio March of Dimes and served as player representative 
for the American League. He worked with National League representative 
Robin Roberts throughout the offseason, discussing the possibility of player 
arbitration and pensions with baseball owners; he then became president 
of the Baseball Players' Association.[2]:244 In the 1956 season, Feller 
started four games and appeared in 15 others, and finished with an 0–4 
record and career-worst 4.97 ERA.[13] The Indians held "Bob Feller Night" 
on September 9, and he appeared in his last major league game on September 
30.[10]:71 After the season, speculation mounted regarding whether Feller 
would retire as a player.[50] In December 1956, Feller told The Plain Dealer: 
"I will return to Cleveland later this week and plan to confer with Hank 
Greenberg before Christmas. I hope to reach a decision at that time."[51] 
Greenberg had also offered Feller his release or a job with the Indians 
in their front office. Greenberg said, "We sincerely want Feller to remain 
with us. As far as I'm concerned, there will always be a job waiting for 
Bob in the Cleveland organization."[51] On December 28 Feller officially 
retired from the Indians as a player to continue his work selling insurance.[52] 
Announcing his retirement, Feller said, "I could have gone with a couple 
other ball clubs, but anything I might have done with them would have taken 
the edge off the success I have had with the Cleveland club the last 20 
years." He continued, "What if I did pitch another year, so what? I would 
have to come to the decision I am making now, some time."[53] He spent 
his entire career of 18 seasons with the Indians, being one of "The Big 
Four" in the Indians' pitching rotation in the 1950s, along with Bob Lemon, 
Early Wynn and Mike Garcia. Feller shares the Major League record of 12 
one-hitters with Nolan Ryan, and was the first pitcher to win 20 or more 
games before the age of 21.[3] He ended his career with 266 wins, 2,581 
strikeouts and 279 complete games. Over the course of his career, he led 
the AL in strikeouts seven times and walks four times.[13] Upon his retirement, 
Feller held the major league record for most walks in a career (1,764), 
and holds the 20th-century record for most walks in a season (208 in 1938).[54] 
The Indians retired his jersey number, 19, in 1957.[55] In 1962, Feller 
was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum along with 
Jackie Robinson. Both were the first to be elected on their first ballot 
appearance since the original induction class of 1936.[39] At the time 
of his induction only Ty Cobb (98.2%), Babe Ruth (95.1%), and Honus Wagner 
(95.1%) had a higher percentage of ballot votes. In 2010, after Feller 
had been admitted to hospice, a reporter released a story recalling a 2007 
interview with an aged Feller where he brought up Feller and Robinson's 
occasional dislike for each other. "They overhyped Jackie Robinson. He 
was a good baserunner. He was a fair hitter. He was an average second baseman. 
He was not as good a ballplayer as Larry Doby. There were a lot of better 
black ballplayers than Jackie Robinson," said Feller.[56] Throughout his 
career, Feller played exhibition games during the off-season, playing in 
towns unaccustomed to seeing major league ballplayers. His exhibition tours 
often featured other big leaguers and Negro League players, like Satchel 
Paige, who was also a teammate of Feller's with the Indians.[57] Other 
players included Stan Musial, Mickey Vernon, and Jeff Heath.[58] During 
a barnstorming tour in 1945, Feller pitched against Jackie Robinson after 
he had been signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers. He told a reporter in Los Angeles 
he believed Robinson was too muscle-bound to succeed against pitching in 
the major leagues although Robinson recorded two hits off Feller.[14][59][60] 
Players had to notify the Commissioner of Baseball, A.B. "Happy" Chandler, 
before participating in exhibitions games and were not allowed to begin 
games before the conclusion of the major-league season. Feller wrote to 
Chandler, challenging the league's limit on the number of games that were 
allowed to be played and proposing an increase; the Commissioner agreed 
to Feller's proposal.[61] To minimize travel time, Feller employed airplanes, 
such as two DC-3s in 1947, to transport players from town to town. Feller's 
involvement, as well as that of other major league players, was the subject 
of meetings between the Commissioner and AL and NL presidents.[62] In 1947, 
Feller announced that he would pitch in the Cuban winter league during 
the off-season, but Commissioner Chandler ruled no major leaguer could 
play in Cuba.[63] Feller said he would donate his profits from playing 
in the Cuban winter league to the American Major League players' pension 
fund: "I want to prove I'm not going to Cuba for any selfish interest but 
because there is a principle involved and that is the right of any ball 
player to work at his chosen profession".[64] Feller also believed it was 
"grossly unfair" that major leaguers who were U.S. citizens could not play 
in winter leagues but Latin Americans were permitted.[65] Indians owner 
and president Bill Veeck said, "I have no comment on Bob's outside activities. 
I don't know whether they've hurt him or not. But I do know this. The great 
majority of the people of Cleveland think they've hurt him."[63] Feller's 
barnstorming business savvy and endorsement details made him one of the 
wealthiest players of his time but he claimed his off-season exhibitions 
and barnstorming were necessary to pay for increased medical expenses for 
his family. His first wife developed anemia after giving birth to their 
second child when she was given the wrong type of blood during transfusions; 
she subsequently became addicted to the prescribed medication for her condition.[5] 
Feller was trying to make up lost earnings as a result, since he missed 
out on over $200,000 in salary when he served in the Navy; he missed more 
than three major league seasons.[61] Feller's biographer John Sickels suggested: 
"They were trying to make money, but part of it was also, he felt that 
the black players weren't necessarily getting a fair chance and that he 
wanted to sort of showcase it. And seeing those, I think, those exhibition 
games helped people realize that the Negro League players were just as 
good as the Major League players."[66] Feller estimated that military service 
cost him at least 100 career wins. Based on his exceptional 1941 and 1946 
seasons, it is likely that Feller would have finished his career with more 
than 300 wins and perhaps 3,800 strikeouts.[67] Feller said "I know in 
my heart I would have ended up a lot closer to 400 than 300 if I hadn't 
spent four seasons in the Navy. But don't take that as a complaint. I'm 
happy I got home in one piece."[14] There is footage of a Feller fastball 
being clocked by Army ordnance equipment (used to measure artillery shell 
velocity) and registering at 98.6 mph (158.7 km/h).[68] However, this took 
place in the later years of his career and the speed of the ball was measured 
as it crossed the plate (whereas later methods measure the speed as it 
leaves the pitcher's hand). With primitive equipment Feller was at one 
point measured at 105 mph (169 km/h).[12] Feller once mentioned that he 
was clocked at 104 mph (167 km/h) at Lincoln Park in Chicago.[69] He also 
threw the second fastest pitch ever officially recorded, at 107.6 mph (173.2 km/h), 
in a game in 1946 at Griffith Stadium.[1][4]:27 Feller said a 1974 test 
involving Nolan Ryan would be evaluated when he threw the ball rather than 
when it reached home plate, and as columnist Milton Richman wrote, Feller 
said "Sandy Koufax had the best live fast ball he ever saw."[70] Ted Williams 
said, "Three days before he pitched I would start thinking about Robert 
Feller, Bob Feller. I'd sit in my room thinking about him all the time. 
God I loved it ... Allie Reynolds of the Yankees was tough, and I might 
think about him for 24 hours before a game, but Robert Feller: I'd think 
about him for three days."[5] Feller was ranked 36th on Sporting News's 
list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and also the publication's "greatest 
pitcher of his time" as well as a finalist for the Major League Baseball 
All-Century Team in 1999.[71] Each year, American Legion Baseball presents 
the "Bob Feller Pitching Award" to the pitcher "with the most strikeouts 
in regional and national competition."[72] Feller was elected the inaugural 
president of the Major League Baseball Players' Association in 1956.[73] 
As president, he appeared before Congress to speak about baseball's reserve 
clause.[74][75] Feller was the first player to get a franchise to agree 
to a share of game receipts when he was the starting pitcher for Indians' 
games. He was also the earliest player to incorporate himself (as Ro-Fel, 
Inc.).[66][76] He was also one of the first players to work for the right 
of a player to enter free agency. Feller and his wife, Virginia Winther, 
had three sons, Steve, Martin, and Bruce. The couple divorced in 1971; 
from the divorce settlement, Virginia received the house she and Feller 
had built. Virginia died on May 6, 1981 in her home in Shaker Heights, 
Ohio.[77] In retirement, Feller lived with his second wife, Anne Feller, 
in Gates Mills, a suburb of Cleveland.[2]:263 Feller is credited with being 
the first baseball star to sign autographs at baseball memorabilia conventions,[78] 
and was such a frequent guest at such events that one ESPN writer speculated 
that he may have signed more autographs than any other person.[79] In June 
2009, at the age of 90, Feller was one of the starting pitchers at the 
inaugural Baseball Hall of Fame Classic, which replaced the Hall of Fame 
Game at Cooperstown, New York.[80] Feller was treated for leukemia in August 
2010.[81] By October, Feller was fitted with a pacemaker and was diagnosed 
with pneumonia and thrush, an infection of the mucous membrane lining the 
mouth and throat. He was transferred on December 8 from the Cleveland Clinic 
to hospice care.[82] On December 15, Feller died of complications from 
leukemia at 92.[14] Of Feller's death, Mike Hegan, Indians broadcaster 
and son of former Feller teammate and battery mate Jim Hegan, stated, "The 
Indians of the 40s and 50s were the face of the city of Cleveland and Bob 
was the face of the Indians. But, Bob transcended more than that era. In 
this day of free agency and switching teams, Bob Feller remained loyal 
to the city and the team for over 70 years. You will likely not see that 
kind of mutual loyalty and admiration ever again."[83] In 2010, the "Cleveland 
Indians Man of the Year Award" was renamed the "Bob Feller Man of the Year 
Award".[83] On Opening Day of the 2011 season, the Indians invited Feller's 
widow, Anne, to present a silent first pitch. During pregame introductions, 
Cleveland players wore a No. 19 jersey in honor of Feller. For the entire 
2011 season the players' uniforms were outfitted with an outline of Feller's 
pitching motion. The organization also made a permanent memorial of the 
press-box seat that Feller used in later life.[84] The Bob Feller Museum 
opened in Van Meter, Iowa, on June 10, 1995. Designed by Feller's son Stephen, 
on land donated by Brenton Banks,[85] the museum has two rooms that contain 
Feller memorabilia and items from his own collection. The Feller bat used 
by Babe Ruth when he made his last public appearance at Yankee Stadium 
is at the museum. Feller said a teammate had stolen the bat and eventually 
it was purchased by the sports card company Upper Deck for $107,000. Feller
