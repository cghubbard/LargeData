Joshua Isaiah "Josh" Harrison (born July 8, 1987) is an American professional 
baseball second baseman with the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Harrison has also played third base and outfield for the Pirates. 
Harrison began playing tee ball at the age of three years. Before playing 
in organized baseball, Harrison displayed interest in the game. Using a 
fork from his homes kitchen as a bat and a balled-up piece of paper, Harrison 
played makeshift baseball with his older brother, Vince, who pitched the 
paper to him.[1] Harrison played shortstop at Princeton High School (Sharonville, 
Ohio) in Cincinnati, Ohio. Prior to his professional career, Harrison played 
second base while attending the University of Cincinnati. In 2008, he was 
the Big East Conference's Co-Player of the Year. Harrison was drafted by 
the Chicago Cubs in the 6th round of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft 
becoming the first Bearcat drafted in the first ten rounds since Kevin 
Youkilis was taken in the eighth round of the 2001 MLB Draft by the Boston 
Red Sox.[2] He was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 6th round of the 
2008 Major League Baseball Draft. On July 30, 2009, the Cubs traded Harrison, 
along with Kevin Hart, and José Ascanio to the Pittsburgh Pirates for pitchers 
John Grabow and Tom Gorzelanny.[3] Harrison had his contract purchased 
by the Pirates on May 30, 2011.[4] Harrison made his major league debut 
on May 31, 2011, and recorded his first Major League hit, off New York 
Mets pitcher R.A. Dickey. On May 18, 2012, he broke up Justin Verlander's 
no-hitter in the ninth inning, which would have been the third no-hitter 
of Verlander's career. Harrison was optioned to the Triple-A Indianapolis 
Indians on April 14, 2013.[5] He was recalled on May 7 when James McDonald 
was placed on the disabled list. Harrison was optioned back to Indianapolis 
on May 8 when Duke Welker was recalled.[6] Harrison was optioned back to 
Indianapolis on May 31.[7] On July 6, 2014, Harrison was selected to his 
first career All-Star Game, along with teammates Andrew McCutchen and Tony 
Watson.[8] At the time of his selection, Harrison was hitting .298 through 
72 games. Harrison also had played 5 different positions throughout the 
season, and was listed as a utility player for the All-Star Game. Despite 
his role as a utility player throughout the 2014 season, Harrison played 
in 143 games and stood at bat enough times to qualify for the NL batting 
title. Finishing the season with a .315 batting average, Josh came in second 
to Justin Morneau of the Colorado Rockies. Morneau won the title with a 
.319 average after sitting out the team's final two games, one of which 
lasted twelve innings. Since then, Harrison has played multiple positions 
for the Pirates. He spends most of his time at third base following Pedro 
Álverez's move to 1st Base. Harrison finished 2014 with the best statistics 
of his career with a .315 batting average (second in the NL), 13 home runs, 
52 runs batted in, and finished ninth in voting for NL MVP.[9] Harrison 
began the 2015 season as the starting third baseman for the Pirates, agreeing 
to a four-year contract extension through 2018, with club options for 2019 
and 2020, shortly after the season's start.[10] Following the 2015 season, 
the Pirates' regular starting Second baseman, Neil Walker, was traded to 
the New York Mets. Josh Harrison is slated to begin the 2016 season starting 
at second base. Harrison is the nephew of former Major League outfielder 
and current Milwaukee Brewers coach John Shelby. Harrison's brother, Vince 
Harrison, played minor league baseball from 2001-2011, before joining the 
Pirates organization as a player-coach.[1][11] Beginning in 2014, Harrison 
started a youth baseball camp for kids and teens in Cincinnati.[12] Harrison's
