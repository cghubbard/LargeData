-73.9492079 Yorkville is a neighborhood in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, 
New York City. Its southern boundary is East 79th Street, its northern 
East 96th Street, its western Third Avenue, and its eastern the East River.[1] 
The neighborhood, in Manhattan Community Board 8,[2] is among the most 
affluent in the city. In August 1776, George Washington stationed half 
of his Continental Army in Manhattan, with many troops in the Yorkville 
area in defensive positions along the East River to protect the other half 
of his army if they were to retreat from Brooklyn, and to inflict damage 
on invading land and sea forces.[3] Following the Battle of Long Island 
defeat on August 27, the Continentals implemented an orderly pivoting retreat 
in the Yorkville area, leading the enemy to entice the Continentals to 
fight by piping "Fly Away", about a fox running away from hounds. The Continentals' 
disciplined northerly retreat led to the successful Battle of Harlem Heights 
in September 1776.[4] In 1815, the Upper East Side was a farmland and market 
garden district.[5] The Boston Post Road traversed the Upper East Side, 
locally called the Eastern Post Road; milepost 6 was near the northeast 
corner of Third Avenue and 81st Street. From 1833 to 1837 the New York 
and Harlem Railroad, one of the earliest railway systems in the United 
States, was extended through the Upper East Side along Fourth Avenue (later 
renamed Park Avenue).[6] A hamlet grew near the 86th Street station, becoming 
the Yorkville neighborhood as gradual yet steady commercial development 
occurred. The current street grid was laid-out between 1839 and 1844 as 
part of the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, so the Eastern Post Road was abandoned. 
The community had been referred to as Yorkville before 1867.[7] By 1850, 
a significant proportion of the inhabitants of the area were the Germans 
and the Irish that helped build the Croton Aqueduct.[8] The area was included 
in the 19th administrative district whose boundaries were 40th and 86th 
Street.[9] In 1858, trams were built along Second and Third Avenues. After 
the American Civil War, mansions replaced slums in Yorkville.[9] On December 
30, 1878, the IRT Third Avenue Line opened, followed by the IRT Second 
Avenue Line in August 1879.[10] For much of the 19th and 20th centuries, 
Yorkville was a middle- to working-class neighborhood, inhabited by many 
people of Czech, Slovak, Irish, Polish, German, Hungarian, and Lebanese 
descent. The area was a mostly German enclave, though.[11] The neighborhood 
became more affluent.[12] From 1880, Yorkville became a destination for 
German-born immigrants. However, by the 1900s, many German residents moved 
to Yorkville and other neighborhoods from "Kleindeutschland" (Little Germany) 
on the Lower East Side after the General Slocum disaster on June 15, 1904. 
The ship caught fire in the East River just off the shores of Yorkville, 
leading family members to move closer to the site of the incident.[13] 
Most of the passengers on the ship were German.[14][15] In addition, the 
general trend towards moving to the suburbs reduced the German population 
in Manhattan; by 1930, most German New Yorkers lived in Queens. On 86th 
Street, in the central portion of Yorkville, there were many German shops, 
restaurants and bakeries. Yorkville became the melting pot of populations 
arriving from various regions of the Prussian-dominated German Empire and 
its colonies, where many cultures spoke German. In the 1930s, the neighborhood 
was the home base of Fritz Julius Kuhn's German American Bund, the most 
notorious pro-Nazi group in 1930s America, which led to spontaneous protests 
by other residents.[16] Yorkville was a haven for refugees from fascist 
Germany in the 1940s, and from refugees from communist regimes in the 1950s 
and 1960s. The neighborhood is the site of the annual Steuben Parade, a 
large German-American celebration.[17] The largest non-German group were 
the Irish.[18] Irish mostly lived in an area bounded by 81st and 85th Streets, 
and Lexington and Fifth Avenues. They attended mass at such churches as 
St. Ignatius Loyola on 84th Street and Park Avenue, Our Lady of Good Counsel 
(90th Street) and the Church of St. Joseph (87th Street). There were many 
Irish bars including Finnegan's Wake, Dorrian's Red Hand Restaurant, Ireland's 
32, Carrol's Hideaway, O'Brien's and Kinsale Tavern. Until the late 1990s, 
New York's St. Patrick's Day Parade ended at 86th Street and Third Avenue, 
the historical center of Yorkville.[19] In addition, Jews also lived on 
Second Avenue.[10] 79th Street was a hub for the Austro-Hungarian populace. 
Popular restaurants included the Viennese Lantern, Tokay, Hungarian Gardens, 
Robert Heller's Cafe Abazzia at 2nd Avenue, Budapest and the Debrechen.[20] 
There were also a number of butcher stores and businesses that imported 
goods from Hungary. Churches included St. Stephen Catholic Church and the 
Hungarian Reformed Church on East 82nd Street. In addition, Czechs, Poles 
and Slovaks lived from 65th to 73rd Street. Besides Ruc, a Czech restaurant 
off Second Avenue, there were sokol halls on 67th and 71st Streets. There 
were other Czech and Slovak businesses, such as Czech butcher shops, poultry 
and grocery stores, and shops that sold imported goods such as Bohemian 
books, leather products and crystal.[20] Around the late 1920s, Yorkville's 
ethnic diversity was beginning to wane. In 1926, the New York Times wrote 
of Yorkville's changing ethnic makeup: Yorkville, for well-nigh two decades 
known to connoisseurs of east side life as the exclusive domain of Czechoslovaks, 
Hungarians and Germans, is slowly giving up its strongly accentuated Central 
European character and gradually merging into a state of colorless impersonality…[9] 
In 1928, a one-block section of Sutton Place north of 59th Street, and 
all of Avenue A north of that point, was renamed York Avenue to honor U.S. 
Army Sergeant Alvin York, who received the Medal of Honor for attacking 
a German machine gun nest during World War I's Meuse-Argonne Offensive.[21][22][23] 
The dismantling of the Third Avenue El in 1955 led to the demolition of 
many mansions. This led to the acceleration of the exodus of Yorkville 
residents. Over the years, this trend continued. Thus, in the 1980s, a 
building for members of the German gymnastic society Turners, at the intersection 
of 86th Street and Lexington Avenue, was demolished. Cafe Mozart, on 86th 
Street between Second and Third Avenues, was also demolished. In their 
place were built high-rise residential complexes.[10][20] By the turn of 
the 21st century, East 82nd Street was co-named St. Stephen of Hungary 
Way. The area from East 79th to 83rd Streets, spanning approximately four 
blocks east-west, is colloquially known as Little Hungary.[24] Based on 
data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Yorkville was 
77,942, an increase of 1,174 (1.5%) from the 76,768 counted in 2000. Covering 
an area of 319.14 acres (129.15 ha), the neighborhood had a population 
density of 244.2 inhabitants per acre (156,300/sq mi).[25] The racial makeup 
of the neighborhood was 76.0% (59,233) White, 3.7% (2,858) African American, 
0.1% (51) Native American, 9.3% (7,226) Asian, 0.0% (25) Pacific Islander, 
0.3% (216) from other races, and 1.9% (1,466) from two or more races. Hispanic 
or Latino of any race were 8.8% (6,867) of the population.[26] The median 
income for a household in Yorkville is almost twice the average for the 
city, at $85,724.[27] The New York City Department of Education operates 
several public schools in the area. The Lycée Français de New York is located 
on East 75th Street between York and East End Avenue. The City University 
of New York has its administrative offices in Yorkville.[28] Fordham Graduate 
Housing is located on East 81st Street between York and East End Avenues.[29] 
East Side Middle School is located on 91st Street between First and Second 
Avenues. There are currently no operating subway stations in Yorkville 
itself. Western Yorkville is served by 77th Street, 86th Street and 96th 
Street stations on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway,[30] 
one block west of Yorkville's western boundary at 3rd Avenue.[31] As of 
March 2015[update], bus routes M15, M15 SBS, M31, M72, M79, M86, M96, M98, 
M101, M102, M103 of the New York City Bus also operate in Yorkville.[32] 
Eastern Yorkville is very far from any subway connections, and has among 
the farthest walks in Manhattan to any subway stations.[11] Parts of the 
Second Avenue Subway—the 86th Street and 96th Street stations—are under 
construction in Yorkville under Second Avenue, leading to increased residential 
construction and real estate prices in advance of the opening of the new 
subway line.[33] Yorkville is expected to be served by the Citywide Ferry 
Service[34] starting in 2018.[35][36] Residents of Yorkville have included: 
The Rhinelander Children's Center, of the Children's Aid Society Church 
of St. Monica on 79th Street Church of St. Elizabeth of Hungary on 83rd
