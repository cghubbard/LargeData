Orlando Hernández Pedroso (born October 11, c.1965), nicknamed "El Duque", 
is a Cuban right-handed former professional baseball pitcher. His greatest 
success came as a New York Yankees starter during that team's run of World 
Series championships in 1998, 1999, and 2000. He also won a championship 
in 2005 with the Chicago White Sox. He is the half-brother of pitcher Liván 
Hernández. Hernández is well known for his extremely high leg kick and 
his frequent use of Eephus pitch. Hernández played for Industriales of 
Havana in the Cuban National Series, helping the team win that title in 
1992 and 1996. He also represented Havana in Selective Series, on teams 
including Ciudad Habana and Habaneros. He was 126–47 with 3.05 ERA over 
his ten-year career in the National Series. His career winning percentage 
in National and Selective Series, .728, is the league record.[1] Hernández 
was also a fixture on the Cuba national baseball team, and was part of 
the gold-winning Olympic team at Barcelona in 1992. In September 1995, 
Hernández's half-brother, Liván Hernández, defected from Cuba. The Cuban 
national team left Hernández off of their roster in the 1996 Summer Olympics.[2] 
Then in July 1996, Hernández was detained by Cuban state security and interrogated 
about his relationship to an American sports agent. Three months later, 
he was banned from Cuban baseball.[3] On Christmas Day 1997, Hernández 
defected from Cuba, departing on a boat from the small city of Caibarién.[4] 
The U.S. Coast Guard interdicted Hernández, his companion Noris Bosch, 
another baseball player named Alberto Hernández (no relation) and five 
others in Bahamian waters, delivering the entire party to Bahamian authorities 
in Freeport, who confined them in a detention center for illegal immigrants 
pending eventual repatriation to Cuba, the usual outcome of such cases.[5] 
However, after lobbying by sports agent Joe Cubas and representatives of 
the Cuban-American National Foundation (CANF), then-Attorney General Janet 
Reno eventually offered both Hernándezes and Bosch a special status known 
as "humanitarian parole" that would allow them to enter the U.S., based 
on (1) what were judged to be realistic fears of persecution should they 
be returned to Cuba and (2) their status as exceptionally talented athletes, 
a class of person that — like exceptionally talented people in other professions 
— can qualify for special admission to the U.S. under State Department 
rules.[6] However, Hernández declined this offer, eventually accepting 
an offer of asylum in Costa Rica. If he had immediately become a U.S. resident, 
he would have been subject to baseball's regular draft and could only have 
negotiated terms with the team that picked him. As a non-U.S. resident, 
however, he was able to negotiate as a free agent. After two months in 
Costa Rica, Hernández entered the U.S. on a visa arranged by the New York 
Yankees, with whom he had negotiated a four-year, $6.6 million contract.[7] 
In his first year in the Major Leagues in 1998, Hernandez posted a 12-4 
record with a 3.13 ERA. He was part of the World Series-winning team when 
the Yankees beat the San Diego Padres. He finished in 4th place in AL Rookie 
of the Year voting. Hernández enjoyed his best year in 1999, with a 17–9 
record and setting career-highs in strikeouts (157) and innings pitched 
(214.1) as a Yankee. In one comical moment during a game against the Mets 
on June 5, 1999, Hernandez fielded a ground ball by Rey Ordóñez and hurled 
his glove with the ball in it at first base to get the out. After the regular 
season, he was selected the Most Valuable Player in the American League 
Championship Series. The Yankees would eventually win their 2nd straight 
World Series title against the Atlanta Braves. Hernandez went 12-13 with 
a 4.51 ERA during the 2000 regular season. The Yankees then won their 3rd 
straight World Series title after beating the Mets. For his first 3 postseasons 
from 1998–2000, Hernandez performed well by going 8-1 with a 2.23 ERA. 
Hernandez went 4-7 with a 4.85 ERA in 17 games (16 starts). The Yankees 
entered the World Series for the 4th year in a row but ended up losing 
to the Diamondbacks. Hernandez went 8-5 with a 3.64 ERA and 1 save in 24 
games (22 starts). With his 5th straight postseason entry, the Yankees 
faced the Anaheim Angels in the 2002 ALDS but lost the series. On January 
15, 2003, Hernández was traded by the Yankees to the Montreal Expos, in 
a three-team trade that involved the Chicago White Sox.[8] He never appeared 
in a game for the Expos and missed the entire season due to a rotator cuff 
injury in his throwing shoulder that needed surgery to repair. Hernandez 
signed a one-year contract to return to the New York Yankees on March 11, 
2004.[9] He missed the start of the 2004 season due to still recovering 
from his rotator cuff surgery. He started 15 games going 8-2 with a 3.30 
ERA. He led the Yankees to the postseason once again, but they ended up 
losing to the eventual World-champ Boston Red Sox in the 2004 ALCS. In 
2005, while pitching for the Chicago White Sox, Hernández went 9-9 with 
a 5.12 ERA and 1 save in 24 appearances (22 starts). He delivered a memorable 
performance in the sixth inning of Game 3 of the 2005 ALDS against the 
Red Sox. Brought on in relief with the bases loaded and no outs, Hernández 
induced two fly ball outs before striking out Johnny Damon without surrendering 
a run.[10] The White Sox would go on to win the game, sweeping the Red 
Sox out of the playoffs. Leading the White Sox to the World Series, they 
swept the Houston Astros to seal their first championship since 1917. After 
the 2005 season, he was traded along with relief pitcher Luis Vizcaíno 
and the highly touted prospect outfielder Chris Young to the Arizona Diamondbacks 
for former teammate Javier Vázquez. In 9 starts, Hernandez went 2-4 with 
a 6.11 ERA. On May 24, 2006, he was dealt to the New York Mets in exchange 
for relief pitcher Jorge Julio. Hernández's debut season in the National 
League allowed him to attain some offensive feats for the first time in 
his career. On July 29, 2006, Hernández drove in the first two RBIs of 
his career. When asked when was the last time he remembered he drove in 
a run, Orlando said, "In Cuba." Then, on August 20, 2006, at Shea Stadium, 
Hernández had the first stolen base of his career. After his trade to the 
Mets, Hernández went 9–7 with a 4.09 ERA in 20 starts as the Mets won the 
National League East. His pitching in September, going 2–2 with a 2.01 
ERA, led to him being named the Mets Game 1 Starter in the 2006 National 
League Division Series. However, while running sprints in the outfield 
the day before the playoffs started, Hernández tore a muscle in his calf 
and had to be scratched from the postseason roster. He was re-signed by 
the Mets on November 14, 2006. Injuries limited Hernández to just 24 starts 
during the 2007 season, but he pitched successfully when healthy, posting 
a 9–5 record, a 3.72 ERA and 128 strikeouts in 147 innings. Hernández underwent 
foot surgery following the 2007 season and was not ready to begin the 2008 
season with the Mets. He underwent a lengthy post-surgery rehabilitation 
program in Florida with the intent of joining the Mets in August 2008. 
A toe injury that required season-ending surgery in late August 2008 ended 
Hernández' season without ever having to throw a pitch for the Mets. He 
became a free agent at the end of the year . On June 11, 2009, Hernández 
signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers. He was assigned to Triple-A 
Oklahoma. The Rangers informed him that they would not call him up, because 
they do not believe he has the velocity or command to pitch in the majors, 
setting up his release on July 17, 2009.[11] At the time of his release, 
his record with the Triple-A RedHawks was 2–0 in eight relief appearances.[12] 
On July 2, 2010, he signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals, 
attempting a comeback.[13] He went 2–1 with a 1.72 ERA with 21 strikeouts 
in 15 2⁄3 innings for the Rookie League Gulf Coast Nationals and the Double-A 
Harrisburg Senators in the Washington Nationals organization. General Manager 
Mike Rizzo informed Hernández that he would not receive a September call-up, 
and Hernández left the organization.[14][15] Hernandez officially retired 
on August 18, 2011.[16] When Hernández signed with the Yankees in 1998, 
he claimed to have been born in 1969. In 1999, The Smoking Gun published 
his divorce decree from Cuba,[17] which had surfaced in connection with 
a child support case brought by his ex-wife; the decree revealed him to 
have been born in 1965. The official site of Major League Baseball still 
gives his year of birth as 1969, while his pages on ESPN and Baseball-Reference.com 
list it as 1965. Hernández is a two-time Cuban National Series Champion 
(1992 and 1996). In June 2013, Hernández participated in the 67th annual 
Yankees Old-Timers' Day. It was his first appearance during Old-Timers'
