The Detroit Tigers Radio Network is a network of radio stations that covers 
much of Michigan, Northwest Ohio and Northern Indiana along with a few 
parts of Northern Wisconsin and some cities along the Michigan border in 
Ontario, airing Major League Baseball's Detroit Tigers games and related 
programming.[1] The network airs all 162 regular season games, some Spring 
Training games, and all postseason games. Dan Dickerson does play-by-play 
on the broadcasts and former Tiger catcher Jim Price does color commentary.[2] 
Jeff Riger is the studio host. The flagship stations are WXYT 1270 AM and 
WXYT-FM 97.1 in Detroit. Coverage begins 20 minutes before game time with 
two segments. The first is The Brad Ausmus Show, a brief pre-recorded one-on-one 
interview with Tigers manager Brad Ausmus by Dan Dickerson at home games 
and Jim Price on road games. The second is From the Field, a brief interview 
with another Tigers coach or a player (or occasionally, people who have 
nothing to do with the game itself, often to promote an event or cause), 
hosted by Jim Price. Post-game coverage includes a game wrap up, either 
by Price or WXYT's Jeff Riger, scores from around the major leagues by 
Dickerson, and a preview of the next game. Games are syndicated by CBS 
Radio. The current affiliate stations and their cities of license are:[1]
