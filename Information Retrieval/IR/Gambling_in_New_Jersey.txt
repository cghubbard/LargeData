Gambling in New Jersey includes casino gambling in Atlantic City, the New 
Jersey Lottery, horse racing, off-track betting, charity gambling, amusement 
games, and social gambling. New Jersey's gambling laws are among the least 
restrictive in the United States; legal, in-state online gambling was instituted 
in New Jersey in November 2013, and the state is challenging Nevada's grandfathered 
federal statutory monopoly on legal sports betting. In 2016, New Jersey 
voters decided to elect against the proposal to expand gambling into 2 
additional north Jersey counties. Gambling has a long legacy in New Jersey, 
with the state historically being more permissive of gambling than most 
other states. Until they were banned in 1844, lotteries were common in 
New Jersey. They were used to help pay for the military during the French 
and Indian War and American Revolution, and help finance the construction 
of Queen's College (now Rutgers University) and the College of New Jersey 
(now Princeton University).[1][2] Freehold Raceway is the oldest racetrack 
in the United States, with horse racing having taken place there informally 
since the 1830s. The Monmouth County Agricultural Society was formed on 
December 17, 1853, and in 1854 they began holding an annual fair with harness 
racing at Freehold Raceway[3][4] Monmouth Park Racetrack opened in 1870. 
In 1894, the New Jersey Legislature banned parimutuel gambling,[5] and 
in 1897 the voters of New Jersey approved a referendum which amended the 
state constitution to ban all gambling (or possibly all commercial gambling).[6] 
From 1894 to 1939, all gambling was theoretically outlawed in New Jersey, 
but enforcement was spotty, and it is not clear whether social gambling 
was prohibited. Bookmaking, numbers games, and slot machines were common 
through the state, many churches and other non-profit organizations openly 
held bingos, and Freehold Raceway operated without interruption.[7] Racetrack 
gambling was re-legalized in 1939. In 1953, voters approved a referendum 
to officially allow non-profit organizations to have bingo and raffles. 
In 1959, amusement games were re-legalized after a 1957 court decision 
had declared them to be a form of illegal gambling.[8] In 1970, 81.5% of 
New Jersey voted in favor of a referendum creating the New Jersey Lottery,[1] 
and in 1975, New Jersey initiated the Pick-It (later renamed the Pick-3), 
the first legal lottery game in the United States where buyers could pick 
their own numbers.[9] In 1974, New Jersey voters voted against legalizing 
casino gambling statewide, but two years later approved a new referendum 
which legalized casinos, but restricted them to Atlantic City.[10][11] 
At that time, Nevada was the only state with legal casino gambling. Resorts 
Atlantic City was the first casino to open in 1978.[12] As part of the 
state's budget showdown in 2006, gambling in Atlantic City's casinos and 
at racetracks in the state were forced to close after it was determined 
that the official monitors from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission 
were essential and New Jersey law stated that gambling establishments could 
not legally operate without state oversight. The closures cost the state 
an estimated $1.3 million in casino revenues in addition to the loss of 
state taxes collected on casino employee wages.[13] In January 2012, New 
Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed legislation allowing sports betting 
in New Jersey after it was approved by a 2-to-1 margin in a voter referendum 
held in November 2011.[14] The law permits any of the state's 12 casinos 
and 4 racetracks to offer gambling on professional and college sports, 
but prohibits them from accepting bets on college events played in New 
Jersey, or out-of-state games involving New Jersey college teams.[15] The 
New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement subsequently issued regulations 
for sports betting.[16] The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), 
the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League 
(NFL), the National Hockey League, and Major League Baseball filed a federal 
lawsuit against New Jersey to prevent sports betting, based on the Professional 
and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 which banned sports betting in 
all but four states.[17] In February 2013, United States District Court 
judge Michael A. Shipp ruled in favor of the athletic leagues, and barred 
New Jersey from issuing sports betting licenses. The court ruled that under 
the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, the regulation of 
gambling and the granting of a grandfather clause to four states is within 
Congress's power.[18][19] In September 2013, a three-judge panel from the 
3rd Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1 to uphold Shipp's decision.[20][21] 
Christie said he will appeal the case to the United States Supreme Court.[22] 
In January 2011, the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill sponsored by 
Raymond Lesniak to allow online gambling by New Jersey residents over the 
age of 21.[23][24] Because the state constitution only allows casino gambling 
in Atlantic City,[25] the legislation specified that the computer servers 
operating the online gambling websites must be located at licensed casinos 
in Atlantic City.[23] The Lesniak bill evaded possible federal prohibitions 
against online gambling by authorizing the Casino Control Commission to 
create regulations to ensure that the bets were placed from inside New 
Jersey.[23][26] However, Governor Chris Christie vetoed the legislation 
because of concerns that "allowing customers to bet through any computer 
terminal left open the chance of commercial businesses such as nightclubs 
and cafes becoming gambling hubs around the state", and "the bill further 
created a legal fiction that a bet placed anywhere in New Jersey counted 
as an Atlantic City bet."[27] In December 2011, the United States Justice 
Department issued a legal opinion that the Federal Wire Act only prohibited 
online sports betting, and not online casino games.[28] John Wefing, a 
constitutional scholar at Seton Hall Law School, told a state Assembly 
committee that he did not believe that a constitutional amendment was needed 
to authorize online gambling because "any online poker bet would not be 
completed until a server in Atlantic City accepted the wager,"[29] and 
"wagers are contracts, and the law recognizes that contracts occur where 
the final action needed to take place occurs."[30] However, State Senator 
Jennifer Beck has stated that online gambling cannot be legalized with 
the approval of New Jersey voters,[31] and several federal courts decisions 
have said that an online bet occurs in both the location of the website, 
and the location of the gambler.[32][33] To address Christie's concerns, 
new legislation was drafted that prohibits businesses other than Atlantic 
City casinos from advertising online gambling, or allowing their facilities 
to be used for online gambling.[34][35] On February 26, 2013, a revised 
bill permitting Internet gambling was overwhelming approved by the New 
Jersey Legislature, and then signed into law by Chris Christie.[36] The 
law legalizes online casino gambling for a 10-year trial period, restricts 
the operation of the websites to Atlantic City's eleven casinos, and imposes 
a 15% tax on online gambling revenue, instead of the 8% currently imposed 
on casinos.[37][clarification needed] The act requires that the gambler 
be at least 21 years old and play from a computer in New Jersey. The gambler's 
location will likely be verified through a global positioning system (GPS), 
and the bill allows interstate compacts to be signed in future in order 
to authorize multistate gambling.[37] Comps will be available, but will 
need to be redeemed by visiting the casino.[38] Macquarie Capital estimates 
that online gambling will provide Atlantic City's casino with $260 to $400 
million in additional revenue per year.[39] The Casino Control Commission 
will create regulations for online gambling. It is unclear when online 
gambling licenses will be issued, or if there will be any legal challenges 
to the new law.[36] In October 2014, New Jersey state regulators reported 
revenue of over $100 million since regulation began in November 2013. The 
proposed New Jersey Casino Expansion Amendment resulted from an agreement 
among Gov. Chris Christie and Democratic state legislators. State legislators 
were in deadlock over who would be allowed to own new casinos and tax revenue 
sharing. The measure does not say where the casinos would be allowed. Location 
and other matters such as tax rates would be determined by enabling legislation 
to be passed by the state legislature. A law passed by popular vote in 
1976 gives Atlantic City a monopoly on casino gambling in New Jersey.[40][41] 
An analysis by Fitch, a credit-rating agency, determined that as many as 
four of Atlantic City's eight casinos would be bankrupted by expanding 
casino gambling outside the city. Supporters of gambling in North Jersey 
say that the measure would help Atlantic City by redirecting as much as 
$200 million a year in tax revenue to the city. Opponents say that it is 
unlikely that much revenue would be generated and that it would not make 
up for the losses due to new competition. In recent years four Atlantic 
City casinos have closed, causing severe economic problems.[42][43] New 
Jersey currently has seven casinos, all of which are located in Atlantic 
City. In 2011, New Jersey's casinos employed approximately 33,000 employees, 
had 28.5 million visitors, made $3.3 billion in gaming revenue, and paid 
$278 million in taxes.[44] They are regulated by the New Jersey Casino 
Control Commission and New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. New Jersey 
currently has 7 types of lottery games, which are sold by retailers around 
the state. The games are overseen by the New Jersey Lottery Commission, 
and the revenue is used to award prize winners (59%), raise money for education 
(34%), pay commissions to retailers (6%), and cover lottery administrative 
cost (1%).[46] New Jersey currently has four racetracks and four off-track 
betting (OTB) halls, all of which are regulated by the New Jersey Racing 
Commission (an entity of the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General).[47] 
The state passed a law in 2013 permitting one horse race per year on a 
New Jersey beach, and Monmouth Park will be conducting a beach race in 
Atlantic City based on the Palio di Siena.[48][49] The state of New Jersey 
allows charity gambling, where non-profit organizations (e.g., churches, 
fraternal organizations) to run bingos, raffles, casino nights, and armchair 
races.[50] Amusement parks, carnivals, and boardwalks in shore communities 
are allowed to have amusement games involving skill or chance (e.g., spinning 
wheels, skeeball).[51] Charity gambling and amusement games are regulated 
by the New Jersey Legalized Games of Chance Control Commission. New Jersey 
permits social gambling (e.g., workplace football pool, a family poker 
game) insofar as the organizer of the game is on equal terms with the other 
participants, and does not take a cut of the gambling proceeds. Furthermore, 
it is never a criminal offense in New Jersey to be a player in a gambling 
operation.[52] However, the New Jersey Alcoholic Beverage Commission prohibits 
bars and other holder of liquor licenses from allowing social gambling.[53] 
Each year billions of dollars of illegal gambling takes place in New Jersey.[54] 
Illegal gambling operations range from employees who make money on office 
sports betting pools to online poker websites to multimillion-dollar enterprises 
run by organized criminals.[55][56] Despite the availability of legal gambling 
in New Jersey, studies have shown that illegal gambling persists because 
it offers options that are not available legally (e.g., casino gambling 
outside of Atlantic City), and because some gamblers prefer using a bookmaker 
who they personally know.[57] State law does not punish players, but a 
person operating an illegal gambling enterprise, or possessing equipment 
or records used for illegal gambling can face up to 5 years imprisonment 
depending on the quantity and size of the bets.[58] However, illegal gambling 
arrests are rare in New Jersey, and there is presumption of non-incarceration 
for first-time offenders.[59][60] A person must be 21 years of age to gamble 
at a casino in New Jersey.[61] It is legal for a minor to go to a casino, 
insofar as they do not gamble, consume alcoholic beverage, or remain on 
the gambling floor.[62] Underage gambling at a casino is a disorderly persons 
offense (misdemeanor), punishible by a $500–$1000 fine and a mandatory 
six-month driver's license suspension, and plea bargaining of underage 
gambling charges is prohibited.[63] The legal age for other forms of licensed 
gambling (e.g., lottery, horse race) is 18, but a person under 18 may take 
part in amusement games where the prize is an item (e.g., a stuffed animal),
