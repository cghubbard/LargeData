William Paul Coughlin (July 12, 1878 – May 7, 1943), was a Major League 
Baseball third baseman for the Washington Senators (1901–1904) and Detroit 
Tigers (1904–1908). Coughlin spent his entire adult life (1899–1943) playing 
and coaching baseball, as a major league player, minor league coach, and 
spending his last 23 years as the head baseball coach at Lafayette College, 
in Easton, Pennsylvania. Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and nicknamed 
"Scranton Bill" (also "Rowdy Bill"),[1] Coughlin played nine seasons in 
the major leagues. Coughlin had a career batting average of .252 with 159 
stolen bases and 123 sacrifice hits, including 36 sacrifice hits in 1906 
(2nd best in the American League). Coughlin was twice among the AL leaders 
in home runs during the dead-ball era, with 6 each year in 1901 and 1902. 
Coughlin began his major league baseball career with Washington's National 
League club in 1899 but played in only 6 games. Two years later, he joined 
the newly formed Washington Senators for their inaugural season in the 
American League. He played with the Senators from 1901 to 1905. Coughlin's 
best year was 1902, when he had career highs in batting average (.301), 
on-base percentage (.348), slugging percentage (.414), hits (141), doubles 
(27), home runs (6), and RBIs (71). Coughlin was also a strong fielder 
at 3rd base. He led the American League in putouts by a third baseman in 
1901 with 232 (only 11 short of Willie Kamm's AL record of 243) and again 
in 1906 with 188. Over his career, he had 1,269 putouts at third base. 
His 232 putouts in 1901 is the 8th highest single season total in history 
by a major league third baseman. Coughlin was purchased by the Tigers on 
July 31, 1904 for $8,000. From that point through the 1908 season, Coughlin 
was Detroit's starting third baseman. He was a team leader and was named 
team captain in the 1907 and 1908 seasons. Coughlin was the captain for 
the Tigers' first two American League pennant winners in 1907 and 1908. 
Coughlin hit .258 in the 1907 and 1908 World Series but did not score. 
The Tigers lost both Series to the Chicago Cubs. Coughlin was a good baserunner. 
He had 159 stolen bases, including 31 in 1906. He is one of the few MLB 
players to have stolen 2nd base, 3rd base and home in a single game. He 
accomplished the feat in June 1906 against the Washington Senators. Coughlin 
was a light-hitting defensive player, which was common for third basemen 
of that era. In four years as the Tigers regular third baseman, Scranton 
Bill never hit higher than .252, and he slugged over .300 just once. The 
Detroit Tigers teams of 1906–1908, on which Coughlin played, were among 
the most colorful groups in baseball history, with the flying spikes of 
Ty Cobb, on-field antics from Germany Schaefer and Charley O'Leary (who 
toured as a vaudeville act in the off-season), fisticuffs from catcher 
Boss Schmidt who once fought an exhibition match against heavyweight boxing 
champion Jack Johnson, and the shouts, gyrations, and jigs of Hughie "Ee-Yah" 
Jennings from the third base coaching box. Coughlin's role in this colorful 
bunch was as the maestro of the hidden ball trick. The hidden ball trick 
is a play in which the runner is deceived about the location of the ball, 
in an effort to tag him out. Although no known comprehensive list is known 
to exist of all times when the hidden ball trick has worked, Coughlin reportedly 
pulled it off seven times (and at three different positions) -- more than 
any other player in MLB history.[2][3] He pulled it off on May 12, 1905 
against Hobe Ferris of the Boston Red Sox.[4][5] He did it again on September 
3, 1906, catching George Stone in the first inning. In Game 2 of the 1907 
World Series, Coughlin caught Jimmy Slagle with a hidden ball trick, the 
only one in World Series history.[6] After leaving Major League Baseball, 
Coughlin became a baseball coach in the minor leagues and then at Lafayette 
College in Easton, Pennsylvania. From 1909 to 1917, he was a minor league 
manager for the Williamsport Millionaires (1909–1910), Allentown (1912–1913), 
and Scranton Miners (1914–1917). He was a player-manager until 1914. In 
1919, Coughlin was involved in the occupation of Germany after World War 
I. Coughlin conceived and operated a school for umpires run by the Knights 
of Columbus in occupied Coblenz, Germany. Coughlin taught the umpire candidates 
to officiate baseball games for the occupying servicement. Coughlin taught 
his umpires to play "The Star Spangled Banner" if fights erupted among 
the players, causing "rocks held ready to avenge an unpopular decision" 
to fall from "reverent hands." (Harold Seymour, Baseball: The People's 
Game (Oxford Univ. Press 1990), p. 347)[7] After the war, Coughlin became 
the head baseball coach at Lafayette College, a post he held from 1920 
to 1943. He had only one losing season in his 23 seasons at Lafayette. 
His coaching record at Lafayette was 273-134, a .675 winning percentage. 
His teams were 52-13 against rival Lehigh and 31-8 against Rutgers. Under 
Coughlin, the Lafayette baseball program became one of the best in the 
country. Coughlin was inducted into the Helms Foundation College Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1954 and the Lafayette College Hall of Fame in 1977.[8]
