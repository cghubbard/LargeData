The St. Paul Colored Gophers was a small club of black baseball players 
formed in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1907.[1] They were not a formal Negro 
league team, as the commonly referred-to "Negro leagues" were not created 
until 1920. However, like other barnstorming teams of the time, they put 
considerable pressure on the desegregation of baseball. Historians rarely 
mention the Colored Gophers in Negro baseball history, and statistics are 
hard to find. The club lasted several seasons, also playing under the name 
Twin City Gophers and Minneapolis Gophers. In 1909, the Colored Gophers 
defeated what was considered to be the most powerful Negro baseball team, 
the Leland Giants. They were managed that year by Phil "Daddy" Reid and 
Williams, they managed to land Taylor brothers Candy Jim Taylor and Steel 
Arm Johnny Taylor. Candy Jim went on to manage the team in 1910.[2] Played 
as the Twin City Gophers.[4] Played as the "'St. Paul Gophers'".[6] Played 
as the "'Minneapolis Gophers'".[7][8] Played as the "'Minneapolis Gophers'".[9]
