Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2010 proceeded according to 
rules enacted in 2001 and revised in 2007. As always the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from a ballot of 
recent players; one player was elected.[1] In keeping with the 2007 reform, 
one Veterans Committee convened to consider a ballot of managers and umpires, 
another to consider a ballot of executives; one manager and one umpire 
were elected. A Veterans Committee election to select from older players 
had been held in the 2009 cycle. The next election for players whose careers 
began in 1943 or later was scheduled for the 2011 class of inductees while 
the next for pre-1943 players was scheduled for the 2014 class.[2] However, 
a reform of the Veterans Committee(s) was announced in July 2010. Henceforth 
long-retired players and all non-playing personnel will be considered on 
a single ballot, with the ballot restricted by the "Era" in which candidates 
made their greatest contributions. The next Veterans Committee elections, 
held in December 2010 as part of the 2011 induction cycle, considered only 
figures from what the Hall calls the "Expansion Era"—1973 and later. Candidates 
from the "Golden Era" (1947–1972) were considered in the balloting for 
2012, and candidates from the "Pre-Integration Era" (1871–1946) will be 
considered in the balloting for 2013. Subsequently the same three committee 
meetings will occur in rotation.[3] Andre Dawson, Doug Harvey, and Whitey 
Herzog were selected as members of the Baseball Hall of Fame.[4] The BBWAA 
was again authorized to elect players active in 1990 or later, but not 
after 2004; the ballot included candidates from the 2009 ballot who received 
at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, 
chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 2004. All 
10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote. Results of the 2010 
election by the BBWAA were announced on January 6.[1] The ballot consisted 
of 26 players, including 11 candidates returning from the 2009 ballot (a 
record low, displacing the previous year's record of 13). 539 ballots were 
cast (including five ballots which supported no candidates), with 405 votes 
required for election. A total of 3,057 individual votes were cast, an 
average of 5.67 per ballot. Those candidates who received less than 5% 
of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually 
be considered by the Veterans Committee.[5] Candidates who were eligible 
for the first time are indicated here with a †. The candidate who received 
at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; 
candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated 
in italics. The candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus 
becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with 
a *. The newly-eligible candidates included 11 All-Stars, who were selected 
a combined total of 51 times – a notable decrease from 2009, when 22 All-Stars 
became eligible. Among the first-ballot candidates were 12-time All-Stars 
Roberto Alomar and Barry Larkin, 7-time All-Star Edgar Martínez, and 5-time 
All-Stars Andrés Galarraga and Fred McGriff. With respect to major end-of-season 
awards, the new field contained one Cy Young Award winner (Pat Hentgen), 
one MVP (Larkin) and one Rookie of the Year (Eric Karros). Alomar won ten 
Gold Gloves at second base (the most for any second baseman).[6] Robin 
Ventura received six at third base.[7] Larkin holds the record for most 
Silver Slugger Awards by a shortstop (nine).[8] Edgar Martínez is tied 
for the record for most Outstanding Designated Hitter Awards (with David 
Ortiz) at five (the award has since been renamed the Edgar Martínez Award).[9] 
Players who were eligible for the first time who were not included on the 
ballot were: Paul Abbott, Andy Ashby, Danny Bautista, Darren Bragg, Brian 
Boehringer, Dave Burba, Greg Colbrunn, Mike Fetters, Brook Fordyce, Karim 
García, Tom Goodwin, Ricky Gutiérrez, Jimmy Haynes, Sterling Hitchcock, 
Curt Leskanic, Josías Manzanillo, Brent Mayne, Mark McLemore, Scott Service, 
Chris Stynes, Scott Sullivan, Todd Van Poppel, John Vander Wal, Fernando 
Viña, and Turk Wendell. For the first time in the history of BBWAA voting, 
two players fell shy of election by fewer than 10 votes.[1] Blyleven, on 
the ballot for the 13th time, fell 5 votes shy; he gained 62 votes from 
his 2009 total. Alomar fell 8 votes short in his first appearance on the 
ballot, and received the highest percentage ever for a first-time candidate 
who was not elected at that time.[10] Both would be elected in 2011. The 
Veterans Committee election process was revised in July 2007. With the 
2007 rules changes, the composite ballot was split into two separate ballots—one 
for managers and umpires and the other for executives. Also, the voting 
membership of the Committee, which previously included all living members 
of the Hall, was reduced to include just a handful of those members, plus 
additional executives and sportswriters. Voting for both the managers/umpires 
and executives ballots, which now takes place prior to inductions in even-numbered 
years,[11] began with the 2008 class of inductees, when two managers and 
three executives were elected. To be eligible, managers and umpires must 
be retired for at least five years, or for at least six months if they 
are age 65 or older, while executives must be either retired or at least 
age 65. A Historical Overview Committee of sportswriters appointed by the 
BBWAA's Board of Directors met to develop a ballot of 10 managers and umpires. 
The managers/umpires list was then submitted to a panel composed of Hall 
of Fame members, executives and veteran media members for a final vote. 
A separate ballot of 10 executives was developed by a panel including executives, 
players and writers, which was the same committee which finally voted in 
that area. The final ballots were released in November 2009. Each panel 
member was allowed to vote for up to four individuals on each ballot, and 
each candidate who received 75% of the vote from either panel was elected; 
therefore, a maximum of five inductions were possible from each ballot. 
Voting was conducted at baseball's winter meetings in Indianapolis on December 
6, 2009, with the results announced the next day; as was the case with 
the 2008 class of inductees, the Committee met to discuss the candidates, 
although the previous three elections had been conducted by mail. The ballot 
for managers and umpires included eight managers (designated M) and two 
umpires (designated U), with 12 votes required for election. Candidates 
who received at least 75% of the vote were elected.[2] Those that were 
inducted are indicated in bold italics. In contrast with the 2008 election, 
voters made less of an effort to vote for as many candidates as they were 
allowed. While at least 58 of the permitted 64 individual votes were cast 
in 2008, the number of known individual votes cast in this election was 
48 of the possible 64. (Vote totals for the five trailing candidates were 
announced as "less than 3", or 0 to 2.) Seven of the candidates had been 
on the preceding ballot in 2008, with Grimm, Kelly, and O'Neill appearing 
for the first time and umpire Cy Rigler dropping off the ballot. Four candidates 
were living when the final results were announced—Harvey (age 79), Herzog 
(78), Johnson (66), and Kelly (59). The election committee, which was announced 
on the same day as the ballot, included:[2] Of the 16 members of the election 
committee, 11 voted for the class of 2008. The five new voters were all 
Hall of Famers—Murray, Roberts, Sandberg, Smith, and 2008 inductee Dick 
Williams. Because of the changes announced for future elections, this was 
the last meeting of this particular committee. Of the ten candidates for 
election, Doug Harvey and Whitey Herzog received the 75% needed to garner 
induction.[12] On the executives ballot, 9 votes were required for election; 
no candidates were elected.[2] As with the other committee, voters in this 
election made less of an effort to vote for as many candidates as allowed 
than in the 2008 election. The number of individual votes cast went down 
to a greater degree than in the managers/umpires balloting—only 28 of the 
possible 48 individual votes were known to have been cast in this election, 
compared to 44 in the 2008 voting. (Vote totals for the six trailing candidates 
were announced as "less than 3", or 0 to 2.) Of the 10 candidates, six 
(Fetzer, Howsam, Kauffman, McHale, Miller, and Paul) were holdovers from 
the 2008 ballot.[13] Autry, Breadon, and Ruppert appeared on the ballot 
for the first time; White, who was on the 2007 composite ballot but was 
not on the 2008 ballot, returned for 2010. Buzzie Bavasi, who died in the 
intervening period, was on the 2008 ballot but not the 2010 ballot. Two 
candidates were living when the results were announced—Miller, age 92, 
and White, age 75. The election committee, which was announced on the same 
day as the ballot, included:[2] Of the 12 members of the election committee, 
eight voted for the class of 2008. The new voters were Hall of Famers Roberts 
and Seaver, executive Schuerholz, and sportswriter Pepe. As with the managers/umpires 
voting committee, this was the final meeting for the executives voting 
committee because of the voting changes announced in July 2010. The J. 
G. Taylor Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer 
induction ceremonies since 1962.[14] It recognizes a sportswriter "for 
meritorious contributions to baseball writing".[15] The recipients are 
not members of the Hall of the Fame, but instead are featured in a permanent 
exhibit at the National Baseball Museum. Three final candidates, selected 
by a three-member BBWAA committee, were named on July 14, 2009 at Busch 
Stadium in St. Louis in conjunction with All-Star Game activities: Bill 
Madden, national baseball columnist for the New York Daily News, Bob Elliott 
of the Toronto Sun and Joe Giuliotti, retired from the Boston Herald. All 
10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to cast ballots in voting conducted 
by mail in November.[15] On December 8 at baseball's winter meetings, Madden 
was announced as the recipient. Madden, who started his career in 1969 
with United Press International before joining the Daily News in 1978, 
received 226 votes out of the 452 ballots cast, with Elliott receiving 
149 votes and Giuliotti receiving 76; one blank ballot was submitted.[15] 
The Ford C. Frick Award has been presented at the induction ceremonies 
annually since 1978 to a broadcaster.[16] Recipients are not considered 
to be members of the Hall, but are permanently recognized in an exhibit 
at the museum. After the 2007 changes to the Veterans Committee, the winner 
(if living) is no longer an automatic member of that body. To be eligible, 
an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous 
major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination 
of the two. Ten finalists were announced in January 2010. In accordance 
with guidelines established in 2003, seven were chosen by a committee composed 
of the living recipients, along with additional broadcasting historians 
and columnists. Three additional candidates were selected from a list of 
candidates through results of voting by fans conducted in December 2009 
on the Hall's Facebook page. The recipient was announced in February following 
a vote by the same committee which selected the first group of finalists. 
They based the selection on the following criteria: longevity; continuity 
with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the World Series 
and All-Star Games; and popularity with fans.[17] Jon Miller, radio announcer 
for the San Francisco Giants, television play-by-play announcer for ESPN 
Sunday Night Baseball and regular-season and postseason announcer on ESPN 
Radio, was announced as the 2010 Ford C. Frick Award winner on February 
2, 2010.[18] Beginning his career in 1974 with the Oakland Athletics, he 
is best known for his radio work with the Baltimore Orioles from 1983 through 
1996, and the Giants from 1997 to the present. Before joining ESPN in 1990, 
he worked with NBC from 1986 through 1989.[19] He also worked with The
