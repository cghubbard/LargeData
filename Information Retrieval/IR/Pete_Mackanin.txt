of Ryne Sandberg. The Phillies later announced they were removing the interim 
label and Mackanin would serve as the team's manager in 2016. Mackanin 
was drafted by the Washington Senators in the 1969 Major League Baseball 
Draft and made his debut with them in 1973, after they moved and became 
the Texas Rangers. In a nine-year major league career, he also played for 
the Montreal Expos, Philadelphia Phillies, and Minnesota Twins. Mackanin's

.968 fielding percentage. After retiring as a player, Mackanin spent many 
years managing and coaching in the minor leagues. He became the Expos' 
third base coach in 1997 and spent four years in that position. After managing 
the minor league Hickory Crawdads and Lynchburg Hillcats in 2001 and 2002, 
he became the bench coach for the Pittsburgh Pirates for the 2003 season. 
After Lloyd McClendon was fired, Mackanin served as the Pirates' interim 
manager for the last month of 2005, leading the team to a 12–14 record.[1] 
He spent the next season managing in the Pirates' minor league system at 
Bradenton. Mackanin was hired by the Cincinnati Reds as a scout for the 
2007 season, but when the team fired manager Jerry Narron on July 1 of 
that year, he was named the club's interim manager. Narron had led the 
Reds in the first half of the 2007 season to a league-worst 51 losses, 
but during Mackanin's tenure, the team had a winning percentage above .500.[1] 
The Reds decided not to hire Mackanin on permanently for the 2008 campaign, 
instead deciding on veteran experience with Dusty Baker.[2] Mackanin was 
hired by the Philadelphia Phillies in 2009 as the bench coach. On October 
3, 2012, the Phillies fired him by deciding not to renew his contract for 
the 2013 season. He was rehired by the Phillies for the 2014 to be the 
3rd base coach for Ryne Sandberg. On June 26, 2015, Pete Mackanin was appointed 
Phillies manager after Ryne Sandberg suddenly stepped down. In between,
