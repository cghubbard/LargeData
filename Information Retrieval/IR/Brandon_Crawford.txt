Brandon Michael Crawford (born January 21, 1987) is an American professional 
baseball shortstop for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He was the sixth player in MLB history to hit a grand slam in his 
first Major League game, and is also the first shortstop to hit a grand 
slam in a Major League Baseball postseason game. Crawford played college 
baseball for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he 
was twice named the team's Most Valuable Player (MVP). Crawford is a native 
of the San Francisco Bay Area, and grew up in Pleasanton. He was born in 
Mountain View,[1] and his family lived in Menlo Park before they moved 
to Pleasanton when he was in elementary school. He grew up a Giants fan, 
and his family purchased season tickets and a commemorative brick in Willie 
Mays Plaza outside AT&T Park when the ballpark opened in 2000.[2] Crawford 
attended Foothill High School in Pleasanton; where he was a three-sport 
athlete playing football, basketball, and baseball. He was the starting 
quarterback for the Foothill Falcons and graduated in the class of 2005.[3] 
Crawford attended UCLA, where he was a physiological sciences major. He 
played baseball for the UCLA Bruins from 2006 to 2008, where he helped 
lead the team to the NCAA Regionals in three consecutive seasons,[1] the 
first time in school history.[4] Crawford was named the team's MVP in 2006 
and 2007, and he was named to the All-Pac-10 conference team in 2007.[1] 
In the summer of 2007, Crawford played for the Orleans Firebirds of the 
Cape Cod Baseball League. He helped lead the United States national team 
to the title in the 2006 International University Sports Federation (FISU) 
World Championship.[5] Crawford was selected in the fourth round (117th 
overall) of the 2008 Major League Baseball draft by the Giants.[1] Crawford 
started his first full season as a professional with the Class-A Advanced 
San Jose Giants in 2009. In 25 games, he hit .371 with six home runs and 
17 RBIs, good enough for a slugging percentage of .600 and 1.045 OPS.[6] 
In May, Crawford was promoted to the Double-A Connecticut Defenders, where 
he spent the rest of the season, batting .258 with four home runs in 108 
games.[6] In 2010, Crawford opened the season in Double-A (now with the 
Richmond Flying Squirrels) and earned an Eastern League All-Star nod,[7] 
batting .241 in 79 games before suffering a broken hand in early July, 
which sidelined Crawford for nearly two months. When he recovered, he was 
assigned back to San Jose for the remainder of the season. He was ranked 
the sixth best prospect in the Giants' organization by Baseball America 
heading into 2011.[8] In 2011, Crawford was invited to Spring training 
but was set back by a broken finger suffered in the final week, and started 
the season in San Jose while he recovered.[9] He was called up to the majors 
for the first time on May 26, 2011, following injuries to Buster Posey, 
Mike Fontenot, and Darren Ford.[10] Crawford made his MLB debut on May 
27 against the Milwaukee Brewers. His first big league hit came in his 
third at bat of the game and was a grand slam off the Brewers' Shaun Marcum. 
He joined Bobby Bonds and Brian Dallimore as the only Giants whose first 
career Major League hit was a grand slam;[11] he also became the sixth 
player in MLB history and the second player in Giants history along with 
Bobby Bonds to hit a grand slam in his first game.[12] On July 31, he was 
optioned to the Giants' Triple-A affiliate, the Fresno Grizzlies, after 
the Giants acquired shortstop Orlando Cabrera.[13] The Giants were 23–18 
with Crawford as a starter, but he was only hitting .190.[14] Crawford 
was recalled in September when MLB rosters expanded to 40 players.[15] 
In 2012, Crawford was named the team's opening day shortstop, in which 
he batted 8th in the lineup. He batted .248 with four home runs, 26 doubles, 
and 45 RBI in 143 games. On July 20, Crawford hit his second career grand 
slam and drove in 5 runs as the Giants defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 
7–2.[16] Crawford was praised for his defense during the 2012 postseason, 
which culminated in a 4–0 sweep of the Detroit Tigers in the 2012 World 
Series.[17] Crawford ranked third among NL shortstops in Defensive Runs 
Saved at +12,[18] and was recognized with the Wilson Defensive Player of 
the Year Award at shortstop. Crawford was the starting shortstop for 2013, 
with Joaquín Árias as his backup. He hit best in April, when he went .272/.346/.511 
with 5 HR and 14 RBI. In 149 games on the year, he hit .248/.311/.363 with 
9 HR and 43 RBI. In 153 games, Crawford batted .246 and set career highs 
with ten home runs and 69 RBIs. On April 13, Crawford hit a tenth inning, 
walk-off home run against Rex Brothers of the Colorado Rockies.[19] In 
the 2014 postseason, Crawford led all Giants with 9 RBIs. In the 4th inning 
of the NL Wild Card Game between the Giants and Pittsburgh Pirates, Crawford 
hit a grand slam off of Edinson Vólquez, becoming the first shortstop to 
hit a grand slam in Major League Baseball postseason history.[20][21] Crawford 
batted .304 (7-for-23) with 4 RBIs in the 2014 World Series, en route to 
his second championship with the Giants. In Game 7, Crawford drove in the 
second run for the Giants with a sacrifice fly and, along with second baseman 
Joe Panik, turned a critical double-play in the third inning.[22] On January 
27, 2015, the Giants and Crawford avoided arbitration by agreeing to a 
one-year, $3.175 million deal.[23] On May 16, Crawford hit his third career 
grand slam (fourth including the postseason) and drove in a career-high 
six runs against Mike Leake of the Cincinnati Reds.[24] In May, Crawford 
led the team in RBIs,[25] and on July 1, Crawford set a new career-high 
with his 11th home run of the season.[26] On July 6, Crawford was voted 
by his fellow Major League players as a reserve for the 2015 MLB All-Star 
Game.[27] On August 14 at AT&T Park, in an 8–5 win over the Washington 
Nationals, Crawford hit his 100th career double. On September 24 at Petco 
Park, Crawford hit his twentieth home run of the season off of Ian Kennedy, 
making him the fourth Giants shortstop in franchise history to reach the 
milestone, after Rich Aurilia, Alvin Dark, and Travis Jackson.[28] Crawford 
set career highs in several offensive categories, batting .256 with 21 
home runs, 84 RBIs, 33 doubles, and 130 hits. Crawford was the first Giants' 
shortstop to lead the team in home runs since Bill Dahlen in 1905.[29] 
He won his first Rawlings Gold Glove Award[30] and Silver Slugger Award,[31] 
the first Giant to win both awards in the same year since Barry Bonds in 
1997.[32] After the 2015 season, Crawford and the Giants agreed to a six-year, 
$75 million contract through the 2021 season.[32] The deal covered Crawford's 
final two years of salary arbitration and first four years of free agency.[33] 
On April 8, 2016, Crawford hit a tenth inning, walk-off home run off Joe 
Blanton of the Los Angeles Dodgers in a game in which the Giants had been 
no-hit through 7 1⁄3 innings and recorded only two hits.[34] On August 
8 at Marlins Park, in an 8-7 win over the Miami Marlins that went into 
extra-innings, Crawford hit a career-high in base hits and singles with 
seven and five respectively. His seven hits tied the NL record for most 
total hits in a single game, and was the first time this feat had been 
done since Rennie Stennett in 1975. The seven hits were also a Giants all-time 
franchise record.[35] Crawford married former UCLA gymnast Jalynne Dantzscher 
in Kona, Hawaii on November 26, 2011.[36] They have two daughters and a 
son.[37][38] Crawford is the brother-in-law of Olympic gymnast Jamie Dantzscher. 
Crawford's sister Amy is engaged to Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Gerrit Cole.[39]
