As player As manager Philip Mason Garner (born April 30, 1949) is an American 
former baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as an infielder 
with the Oakland Athletics, Pittsburgh Pirates, Houston Astros, Los Angeles 
Dodgers and San Francisco Giants from 1973 to 1988. He was manager of the 
Astros from July 14, 2004 to August 27, 2007, leading Houston to a World 
Series appearance in 2005. Garner was originally drafted by the Montreal 
Expos in the eighth round of the 1970 Major League Baseball draft, but 
did not sign. Seven months later, he was the third overall pick by the 
Oakland A's in the secondary January 1971 draft. Originally a third baseman 
when he signed with the A's, he was converted to a second baseman as the 
A's had perennial All-Star Sal Bando at third. Nicknamed "Scrap-Iron" due 
to his gritty style of play, Garner's best year as a player was in 1977 
when he hit 17 HR's, had 77 RBI's, stole 32 bases, hit 35 doubles, and 
scored 99 runs. Two years later in 1979, he was a member of the World Series 
champion Pittsburgh Pirates, batting .417 in the 1979 National League Championship 
Series and .500 (12 for 24) in the World Series. His icon at the time was 
the scrappy, similarly-mustachioed cartoon hero, Yosemite Sam. On August 
31, 1981, Garner was traded from the Pirates to the Astros for second baseman 
Johnny Ray and pitcher Randy Niemann. Garner later became a manager for 
the Milwaukee Brewers, Detroit Tigers and Houston Astros, leading the Astros 
to the franchise's first ever World Series in 2005. In 1992, Garner replaced 
Tom Trebelhorn as manager of the Brewers. He quickly installed a running-focused 
style of play as every starter that year stole at least 10 bases. Standing 
out were 1992 AL Rookie of the Year Pat Listach who stole 54 bases, veteran 
Paul Molitor stealing 31, and outfielder Darryl Hamilton stealing 41. This 
gave the 1992 Brewers a 2nd-place finish in the competitive AL East but 
Garner's teams in later seasons in Milwaukee would not finish at .500. 
In 2000, Garner was hired to manage the Tigers, in their inaugural season 
at Comerica Park. The Tigers were in contention for the American League 
Wild Card berth for much of the season, but faded and finished 79-83. Garner 
didn't manage a winning season in his years in Detroit, and when his 2002 
team began the season 0-6, he and general manager Randy Smith were fired. 
The 2004 season was different for Garner. After the Houston Astros had 
a slow start under then-manager Jimy Williams, Garner was brought in mid-season 
to replace Williams and led the Astros to a National League Wild Card berth, 
eventually losing in seven games to St. Louis in the National League Championship 
Series. The team experienced another slow start in 2005 but made a run 
once again late in the season and came back to win another National League 
Wild Card. This time, Houston would beat the St. Louis Cardinals in the 
National League Championship Series in six games and win the pennant only 
to be swept by the Chicago White Sox in the World Series. Under his leadership 
in the last 12 games of the 2006 season, the Astros won 10 and lost 2 putting 
them a game and half behind the Division winners. Garner's contract was 
extended through the end of the 2008 season by the Astros. As manager of 
a pennant winning team the year before, Garner managed the 2006 National 
League All-Star Team in Pittsburgh on July 11 2006. Garner cites Chuck 
Tanner, his manager during his time with the Pirates, as one of his biggest 
coaching influences [1]. Garner is a strong advocate of having six relief 
pitchers on the roster as opposed to an extra hitter on the bench. On August 
27, 2007, Phil Garner was released from the position of Manager from the 
Astros, along with General Manager Tim Purpura. Cecil Cooper was named 
interim manager for the remainder of the season.[1] In 2008, Phil Garner 
served as interim head coach for the UHV Jaguars baseball team of the University 
of Houstonâ€“Victoria.[3] Garner temporarily replaced former Astros teammate 
Terry Puhl while he fulfilled his obligation as manager of the Canada National 
baseball team. On August 11, 2011, Garner agreed to re-join the Athletics 
as a Special Adviser[4] and agreed to return for the 2012 season in the 
same position.[5] Garner has been involved in some of the longest post-season
