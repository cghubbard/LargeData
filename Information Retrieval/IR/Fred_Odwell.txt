Frederick William Odwell (September 25, 1872 â€“ August 19, 1948) was a professional 
baseball player. He was an outfielder over parts of four seasons with the 
Cincinnati Reds. In 1905, he led the National League in home runs. He was 
born in and later died at the age of 75 in Downsville, New York. 1904 was 
Odwell's first season in the Major Leagues. He made his Major League debut 
on April 16, and finished the season with Cincinnati with a batting average 
of .284, with 133 hits, including 22 doubles, 10 triples and a home run, 
plus 26 walks.[1] In 1905, Odwell finished with a .241 average, with ten 
doubles, nine triples and nine home runs, along with 26 walks. The nine 
home runs hit led the National League that season, edging teammate Cy Seymour 
who had eight.[2] Seymour led the National League that season in batting 
average (.377) and runs batted in (121) and was tied with Odwell for the 
lead in home runs at eight with two games left in the season, and would 
have taken the batting Triple Crown if the two stayed tied. In the next-to-last 
game of the season, Odwell hit an inside-the-park home run and took the 
home run title with nine.[3] The nine home runs he hit in 1905 were the 
last home runs of his Major League career.[4] Odwell only played in 58 
games for Cincinnati in the 1906 season, finishing with a batting average 
of .245 with two doubles, four triples and no home runs, together with 
15 walks. In the 1907 season, his last in the majors, he hit for a .294 
average, with five doubles, seven triples and no home runs, with 22 walks. 
His last Major League game was on September 12, 1907.[1] Though Odwell
