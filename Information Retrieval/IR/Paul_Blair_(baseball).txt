Paul L. D. Blair (February 1, 1944 – December 26, 2013) was an outfielder 
who spent seventeen seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Baltimore 
Orioles (1964–76), New York Yankees (1977–79, 1980) and Cincinnati Reds 
(1979).[1] He was the starting center fielder for the Orioles when they 
won two World Series Championships, four American League (AL) pennants 
and five American League East titles from 1966 to 1974. One of baseball's 
best defensive players at his position, he earned the Gold Glove Award 
eight times, including seven consecutive from 1969 to 1975.[2] One of the 
best defensive oufielders of his era, he had excellent range and was brilliant 
at tracking fly balls.[3] He seemed to taunt hitters by playing shallow, 
then running down balls hit over his head.[4] Blair was born in Cushing, 
Oklahoma but grew up in Los Angeles where he attended Manual Arts High 
School. An accomplished athlete, he played basketball, baseball and track 
while a student.[5] Blair was originally signed by the New York Mets as 
an amateur free agent in 1961. After spending the 1962 season in their 
farm system, he was selected by the Orioles in the 1962 first-year draft 
on November 26, 1962.[6] He broke into the Orioles' lineup in 1965 and, 
despite hitting only .234 with five home runs and 25 runs batted in, impressed 
many with his defensive skills. In 1966 he batted .277 on an Orioles team 
that won the World Series. In Games Three and Four of that series, which 
the Frank Robinson-led Orioles swept from the defending champion Los Angeles 
Dodgers in four games, Blair played a major role in 1-0 shutouts by Wally 
Bunker and Dave McNally respectively, hitting a 430-foot home run off Claude 
Osteen in Game Three, and robbing Jim Lefebvre of an eighth-inning home 
run that would have tied Game Four. Blair also caught Lou Johnson's fly 
ball for the final out of the Series. In 1967 Blair established a career 
high .293 batting average with 11 home runs and 64 RBIs, along with an 
American League-leading 12 triples. He also won the first of his eight 
Gold Glove Awards. After slumping to .211 in 1968, Blair had perhaps his 
best season in 1969. Batting second behind Don Buford in the Orioles' lineup, 
he hit .285 with career highs in home runs (26), runs batted in (76) and 
runs (102). He also made the All-Star team for the first time; he would 
repeat this feat in 1973. His Orioles won the pennant, with Blair becoming 
the first player to have 5 hits in a post-season game, with 5 hits in 6 
at-bats against the Minnesota Twins on October 6.[7] The Orioles lost to 
the Miracle Mets in the World Series. Blair went only 2-for-20 in that 
Series, including being the victim of one of Tommie Agee's two spectacular 
Game Three catches (Agee had also robbed Elrod Hendricks earlier in the 
game). On that Agee catch, Blair would be the first batter Nolan Ryan would 
face in a World Series—the only World Series game the Hall of Fame pitcher 
would participate in. One of Blair's two hits came in the seventh inning 
of Game Two; it broke up Jerry Koosman's bid for a no-hitter. On May 31, 
1970 Blair was beaned by California Angel pitcher Ken Tatum and suffered 
a broken nose. He recovered quickly, finishing the season batting .267. 
That year, Baltimore won another pennant and defeated the Cincinnati Reds 
in five games in World Series. Both Blair and Series MVP Brooks Robinson 
atoned for their 1969 World Series performances (Robinson went 1-for-19, 
the lone hit coming in Game Two, scoring Blair; he was himself the victim 
of a spectacular catch, by Ron Swoboda in Game Four) by tying a five-game 
Fall Classic record with nine hits apiece. In 1971 Blair took up switch-hitting 
but stopped after batting only .193 (11-for-57). He finished the season 
hitting .262. His Orioles won another pennant, but lost the World Series 
to the Pittsburgh Pirates in seven games. Blair's speed going back in the 
outfield enabled him to play shallow, and make catches à la Willie Mays. 
In each of the Orioles' three consecutive World Series seasons, Blair won 
a Gold Glove. He would also win a Gold Glove over the next four seasons, 
his last Gold Glove in 1975 coinciding with teammate Brooks Robinson winning 
his 16th consecutive—and last—Gold Glove at third base. On January 20, 
1977, Blair was traded to the New York Yankees for outfielders Elliott 
Maddox and Rick Bladt. On June 18 of that year in a nationally televised 
game against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, he was tangentially involved 
in one of the most bizarre scenes in baseball history. Yankee manager Billy 
Martin took right fielder Reggie Jackson out of the game and replaced him 
with Blair after Jackson had misplayed Jim Rice's fly ball for a double. 
As the cameras watched, Jackson and Martin nearly came to blows. Actor 
Seth Gilliam played Blair in one episode of the ESPN mini-series The Bronx 
Is Burning. The mini-series chronicled the 1977 Yankees season. After winning 
World Series titles with the Yankees in 1977 and 1978, Blair was released 
early in the 1979 season. The Cincinnati Reds signed him as a free agent 
less than a month later, and Blair returned to the Yankees in May of 1980. 
He retired after the Yankees released him a second time, on July 1 of that 
year. In his 17-year career, Blair, whose nickname, "Motormouth", came 
from his talkative nature, batted .250 with 134 home runs and 620 RBIs, 
1513 hits and 171 stolen bases in 1947 games played. He was also one of 
the top bunters in the game, recording at least 10 sacrifice hits four 
times in his career, including 17 during the 1975 season. At the end of 
his playing career Blair was hired as an outfield instructor for the Yankees 
in 1981. In August 1982 he was named the head coach at Fordham University. 
Blair only coached one season at Fordham with the team finishing with a 
14-19 record. He would then go back to work as an outfield instructor with 
the Houston Astros and as a third base coach for the Orioles Triple A team 
in Rochester and worked in that capacity until 1985. In 1989 he would play 
for the Gold Coast Suns in the newly formed Senior Professional Baseball 
Association, though the league would fold after the season. Blair would 
get his next shot at coaching in 1995 when he was named the manager of 
the Yonkers Hoot Owls in the newly formed Northeast League, an independent 
league of professional baseball. The team would last just one season and 
would finish a dismal 12-52. Blair would get his next, and last, shot at 
coaching in 1998 when he was named as the head coach for the Coppin State 
College baseball team. Blair would coach the team from 1998–2002. Unfortunately, 
his overall record at Coppin State would be a disappointing 30-185.[8] 
After his retirement from coaching, Blair lived in Woodstock, Maryland 
with his wife, Gloria.[1] In his retirement, Blair often appeared in celebrity 
golf and bowling tournaments.[1] At the time of his death, he was known 
for working out at Triangle Fitness in Eldersburg, Maryland and bowling 
at Kings Point Lanes in Reisterstown, Maryland. His son Paul Blair III 
played eight years in the minors for the San Francisco Giants and the Chicago 
Cubs. On December 26, 2013, Blair suffered a heart attack and lost consciousness 
while playing in a celebrity bowling tournament in Pikesville, Maryland. 
He was taken by ambulance to Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, where he was
