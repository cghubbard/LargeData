Wilson Abraham Ramos Campos (born August 10, 1987) is a Venezuelan professional 
baseball catcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the Minnesota Twins and Washington Nationals. He is 6' tall, 
weighs 221 lbs., and bats and throws right-handed. Ramos was signed by 
the Minnesota Twins as a non-drafted free agent on July 7, 2004. He caught 
43% of potential base stealers in his minor league career, and has a .987 
fielding percentage. In 2008, with the Twins' High-A affiliate, the Fort 
Myers Miracle, he batted .242 with eight home runs and 42 runs batted in 
in the first half of the 2008 season, helping his team capture the Florida 
State League first-half West Division title. When 2008 Florida State League 
All-Star catcher James Skelton of the Lakeland Flying Tigers suffered an 
injury, Ramos was added to the West Division All-Star team, joining teammates 
Robert Delaney, Brian Dinkelman, Jeff Manship, Anthony Slama and Danny 
Valencia. Ramos' batting average jumped to .333 in the second half of 2008. 
For the season, he batted .288 with thirteen home runs, and was named to 
the All FSL Team. His 78 RBIs was fourth in the Florida State League.[1] 
Ramos entered the 2009 season ranked as the Twins third best prospect by 
Baseball America behind Aaron Hicks and Ben Revere,[2] and #71 in all of 
minor league baseball. The Twins added Ramos to their 40-man roster, and 
invited him to Spring training. After which, he was assigned to the Twins' 
double A Eastern League affiliate, the New Britain Rock Cats.[3] He broke 
his right index finger in May and suffered a hamstring injury in June, 
forcing him to do a nearly two-month rehab assignment, during which he 
hit three home runs in five games with the Gulf Coast League Twins. Ramos 
rejoined his team in August, and batted .317 with four home runs and 29 
RBIs for the season. Ramos batted over .400 in spring training in 2010. 
However, with Joe Mauer behind the plate, the Twins sent Ramos to the Triple-A 
Rochester Red Wings rather than have him serve in a back-up role in the 
majors.[4] He received his first major league call-up on May 1, when Mauer 
was sidelined by a bruised left heel and was limited to emergency pinch 
hitting.[5] Ramos took the roster spot of Pat Neshek, who was placed on 
the 15-day disabled list retroactive to April 29 with inflammation of the 
middle finger on his right hand.[6] On May 2, facing the Cleveland Indians, 
Ramos slapped a single between third base and the shortstop in the top 
of the second inning for his first major league hit. Ramos went four-for-five 
on the day with three singles and a double. He is the first Twins player 
since Kirby Puckett in 1984 to collect four hits in a major league debut, 
and the only catcher in modern history (since 1900) to collect four hits 
in his MLB debut.[7] On May 3 he followed up his debut by going 3 for 4 
and driving in his first RBI. All told, he played seven games with the 
Twins while filling in for Mauer, batting .296 with three doubles and one 
RBI. On May 13, with Mauer ready to return to action, and José Morales 
coming off the DL, Ramos was reassigned to Rochester. On July 29, 2010, 
Ramos was traded to the Washington Nationals along with Joe Testa for closer 
Matt Capps.[8] In 2011, Ramos was chosen by Baseball America as the catcher 
on its All-Rookie Team.[9] On May 12, 2012, Ramos tore an anterior cruciate 
ligament in his right knee while trying to field a passed ball in a game 
against the Cincinnati Reds. He was placed on the 60-day disabled list 
for the 2012 season.[10] Ramos and Kurt Suzuki began 2013 as the Nationals 
starting catchers. However, on April 13, Ramos hurt his hamstring while 
trying to beat out a ground ball, putting him on the disabled list, with 
Jhonatan Solano replacing him and Suzuki started.[11] After being activated 
on April 29, Ramos quickly went back on the disabled list on May 16 with 
the same injury.[12] Ramos was activated on July 4, and in his first game 
back against the Brewers, he went 3-4 with a three-run home run and 5 RBI. 
His solid July, in which he hit .302/.333/.540 with 4 HR and 17 RBI in 
18 games, earned him more starts over Suzuki before they eventually traded 
Suzuki to Oakland on August 23.[13] Ramos finished the year as the starting 
catcher. In 78 games with the Nationals, Ramos hit .272/.307/.470 with 
16 HR and 59 RBI. Ramos broke his left hand in the opening game of the 
2014 season and left the game. A foul tip hit his hand while he was catching.[14] 
In 2015, Ramos hit .229 in a career-high 475 at-bats, with 15 homers, 68 
RBIs and 101 strikeouts. On January 13, 2016, he and the Nationals agreed 
to a one-year, $5.35 million deal to avoid salary arbitration.[15] In 131 
games in the 2016 season, Ramos batted .307 with 22 home runs and 80 RBI. 
On September 26, 2016, Ramos suffered a torn ACL, ending his season.[16] 
He has one child, born in August 2014.[17] On November 9, 2011 at approximately 
6:45 pm local time, Ramos was approached by four armed men near his home 
in Valencia, Venezuela and was taken away in an SUV. Ramos was with his 
family at the time. On November 10, 2011 at 4:00 pm local time, Ramos was 
reported alive.[18] Originally back in his homeland to play during the 
offseason for his Venezuelan team, Tigres de Aragua, Ramos was rescued 
after two days, and eight suspects were soon in custody. "What they did 
was laugh, joke about my pain," Ramos said in brief remarks on television.
