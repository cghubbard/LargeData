Walter Franklin Judnich (January 24, 1916 – July 10, 1971) was an American 
professional baseball player. He played as a center fielder in Major League 
Baseball for three different teams between 1940 and 1949. Listed at 6 ft 
1 in (1.85 m), 205 lb, Judnich batted and threw left-handed. A native of 
San Francisco, California, and a graduate of Mission High School, Judnich 
entered the majors in 1940 with the St. Louis Browns, playing for them 
for five years (1940–42 and 1946–47) before joining the Cleveland Indians 
(1948) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1949). Basically a contact, line-drive hitter, 
Judnich was a fine outfielder[according to whom?] with a strong throwing 
arm. But he was one of many major leaguers who saw his baseball career 
truncated after his stint in the US Army Air Force during World War II. 
When he came back after discharge, he was 29 years old and no longer at 
the top of his game. In his rookie season with the Browns, Judnich posted 
career-numbers in home runs (24), RBIs (89), and runs scored (97), while 
hitting a .303 batting average to become one of only seven players in the 
American League to reach the .300 mark in the season; ranking 6th behind 
Ted Williams (.356), Johnny Pesky (.331), Stan Spence (.323), Joe Gordon 
(.322) and George Case (.320), and surpassing Joe DiMaggio (.305). After 
his heroics, Judnich was considered in the American League MVP vote. In 
1941, Judnich batted .284 with 14 homers, 40 doubles, 83 RBIs and 90 runs 
in a career-high 146 games. Then, in 1942 he hit 17 home runs (7th in AL) 
with 82 RBIs and a .313 average (a career-high), being nominated again 
to the American League MVP honors. After that, he served in the military 
for the next three years (1943–45). Judnich was released from the USAAF 
in time for the start of the 1946 season with the Browns, when he hit .262 
with 15 homers and 72 RBIs in 132 games. The next year he went .258, 18, 
64 in 144 appearances, and was traded to Cleveland before the 1948 season. 
With the Indians, Judnich was part of a very congested outfield that included 
Larry Doby, Dale Mitchell and Thurman Tucker, between nine others. He did, 
however, get a World Series ring as part of the 1948 Cleveland Indians 
World Champions, playing 49 games in the outfield and 20 at first base, 
as a backup. He also made 10 appearances for Pittsburgh in 1949, his last 
major league season. In a seven-season career, Judnich was a .281 hitter 
(782-for-2786) with 90 home runs and 420 RBIs in 790 games, including 424 
runs, 150 doubles, 29 triples, 20 stolen bases, a .369 on-base percentage, 
and a 1.30 walk-to-strikeout ratio (385-to-298). In four postseason games, 
he hit .077 (1-for-13) with a run and one RBI. Following his major-league 
career, Judnich played for many years in the Pacific Coast League, including 
stints with the San Francisco Seals, Seattle Rainiers, and Portland Beavers.
