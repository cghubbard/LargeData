James Robert "Red" Moore (November 18, 1916 â€“ February 6, 2016) was a professional 
baseball player. Moore was a player in the Negro League, appearing with 
many different teams but most substantially with home team Atlanta Black 
Crackers. He also served with three different All-Star teams and, in 1938, 
played with the Southern News Services All-American Negro League Baseball 
Team. In 2006 he was inducted into the Atlanta Sports Hall of Fame. Born 
in Atlanta, Georgia, Moore began playing after graduating Booker T. Washington 
High School in 1933 with Atlanta Black Crackers.[1] Over the next six years, 
Moore moved among that team, Macon Peaches, Chattanooga Choo-Choos, Schenectady 
Black Socks, Newark Eagles and Baltimore Elite Giants, gradually earning 
a reputation according to Voices from the Negro Leagues as perhaps "the 
best fielding basemen of all time" in his league.[2] In 1940, after finishing 
the regular season in Baltimore, Moore played in a winter season in Los 
Angeles, California that allowed white and black players to compete against 
each other, a competition that was first allowed and then halted by Major 
League Baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.[3] Moore himself 
believed that the games were halted because the black players were too 
successful, stating that "The public, they liked to see the competition, 
but the commissioner, he didn't have that attitude after he found out that 
we were drawin' real good crowds and we were beatin' 'em a lot."[3] Moore 
registered for military draft in October 1940 and served from 1942 to 1945. 
For the three years after World War II, he returned to baseball with the 
Black Crackers.[3] At his most highly paid, prior to the war, he earned 
$250 a month with a $1.50 daily food allowance.[4] In 2006 Moore was among 
six individuals inducted into the Atlanta Sports Hall of Fame, in its second 
year of existence.[5] He died at the age of 99 on February 6, 2016.[6]
