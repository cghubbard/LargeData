Play-By-Play Broadcaster: Robert Sherman The Kenosha Kingfish are a baseball 
team that plays in the Northwoods League (a collegiate summer baseball 
league). Based in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the Kingfish play their home games 
at the newly renovated Simmons Field. There is much baseball history in 
Kenosha as before the Kingfish there was the Kenosha Twins of the Midwest 
league who won titles in 1985 and 1987. They lasted for 8 seasons before 
being sold and moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1992. There was also the 
Kenosha Kroakers who were one of the founding teams of the Northwoods League 
that started in 1994. The Kroakers lasted for 5 seasons before eventually 
moving to Mankato, MN in 1999. The Kroakers were crowned Northwoods League 
Summer Collegiate champions back in 1995 as they beat the Manitowoc Skunks 
in 2 games. The Kenosha Kroakers still hold the Northwoods League record 
for best overall team record at 40-18 which was set in 1995. The Kenosha 
Kings are the oldest team still in existence and have the longest tenure 
at historic Simmons Field of 30 plus years. They have been champions of 
the semi pro Langsdorf league from 2007-2013. Kenosha has also been the 
home to many other semi pro teams in the past such as the Kenosha Cheifs 
and Kenosha Mammoths. In 2013 the Northwoods League started a new era of 
baseball in Kenosha as a new team was established/founded. Before the inaugural 
season began fans got to send in suggestions on what they wanted the name 
of the new team to be. The best selected names were then voted on by fans 
through a poll set up by league/team management. The winning name was then 
revealed at the official launch party on November 23, 2013 as the Kenosha 
Kingfish. The Kingfish name comes from the fish that live in nearby Lake 
Michigan and it's also a tie in to the late Elvis Presley. There mascot 
is a giant Kingfish named King Elvis the first. [2] This was the beginning 
of the Kingfish era in Kenosha as the Kingfish opened there 2014 season 
on the road. They had there very first home series on the weekend of May 
31 and June 1, 2014 at newly renovated Simmons Field. The Kingfish finished 
the 2014 season with a 41-30 record in the Northwoods League South Division, 
narrowly missing the playoffs.[3] The Kingfish finished 2015 with a regular 
season record of 48-24.[4] After beating the La Crosse Loggers 7-2 in Game 
1 of the Divisional Playoffs[5] and the Madison Mallards 2-1 in a close 
Game 2,[6] the Kingfish defeated the St. Cloud Rox, in 2 games, to win 
their first Northwoods League Summer Collegiate World Series. This was 
the first championship with the Kenosha Kingfish franchise. [7] Despite 
their previous successes, the 2016 season was more of a down year for the 
Kingfish as they finished the first half at 16-20 6th place in the South 
and finished the second half at the very bottom of the South in 9th at 
10-26. The overall standings had the Kingfish near the bottom finishing 
26-46 which was 9th place out of 9 teams in the South division. They finished 
with the 3rd worst record in the Northwoods league behind Thunder Bay and
