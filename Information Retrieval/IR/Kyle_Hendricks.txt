Kyle Christian Hendricks (born December 7, 1989), nicknamed "The Professor," 
is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Chicago Cubs of Major 
League Baseball (MLB). He is listed at 6'3" and 190 lb. He throws and bats 
right-handed. Hendricks attended Capistrano Valley High School in Mission 
Viejo, California. He was drafted by the Los Angeles Angels in the 39th 
round of the 2008 MLB Draft, but did not sign and instead chose to attend 
Dartmouth College.[1][2][3] He played college baseball for the Dartmouth 
Big Green under head coach Bob Whalen. In his junior year, Hendricks pitched 
to a 6-3 win–loss record and a 2.47 earned run average with 70 strikeouts 
in 62 innings pitched.[4] The Texas Rangers selected Hendricks in the eighth 
round of the 2011 MLB Draft.[5] He signed with the Rangers, and began his 
professional career with the Spokane Indians of the Class A-Short Season 
Northwest League.[6] The Cubs acquired Hendricks with Christian Villanueva 
in exchange for Ryan Dempster at the 2012 trade deadline.[7] Hendricks 
began the 2013 season with the Tennessee Smokies of the Class AA Southern 
League,[8] and the Cubs promoted Hendricks to the Iowa Cubs of the Class 
AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) during the season.[9] The Cubs named Hendricks 
their minor league pitcher of the year for 2013.[4] Hendricks began the 
2014 season with Iowa. He was named the PCL's pitcher of the week for May 
12–18.[10] After the trade of Jeff Samardzija and Jason Hammel to the Oakland 
Athletics on July 4, 2014, Hendricks made his Major League Baseball debut 
with the Chicago Cubs on July 10, 2014 against the Cincinnati Reds at Great 
American Ballpark.[11] He earned his first win in front of a home crowd 
against the San Diego Padres on July 22, 2014.[12] Hendricks was named 
the National League Rookie of the Month of August.[13] Hendricks finished 
his rookie season with a 7-2 win-loss record and a 2.46 ERA.[14] Hendricks 
tied for seventh place with Travis d'Arnaud and Jeurys Familia in the NL 
Rookie of the Year Award voting.[15] Following an impressive rookie season, 
Hendricks began the 2015 season as a member of the Cubs' starting rotation, 
led by the newly signed Jon Lester.[14][16] On May 21, 2015, Hendricks 
threw his first career complete game shutout against the San Diego Padres, 
striking out seven and facing three batters over the minimum. His record 
was 8-7 with 180 innings pitched and he had an ERA of 3.95.[17] He was 
the starter for game two of the 2015 National League Division Series with 
St. Louis and game three in the 2015 National League Championship Series 
against the New York Mets. Hendricks finished his first half of the 2016 
season with a solid 7-6 record with a rotation leading 2.55 ERA. Kyle threw 
his second career complete game against the Phillies on Saturday May 28 
and was one out short of a shutout. He skipped in front of a struggling 
John Lackey to get the third spot in the Cubs rotation for the second half 
of the season. On August 1, Hendricks threw another complete game for a 
shutout in a 5-0 victory against the Miami Marlins. He had the best ERA 
from July 1 – August 1 in the whole league at 1.00. On August 7, Hendricks 
picked up his eleventh win and moved his ERA down to 2.17, placing him 
as the second lowest in the NL and lowest amongst Cubs starters. Hendricks 
entered September with a 13–7 record and earned run average of 2.09 in 
159 innings pitched, which led all major league starting pitchers. He was 
named NL Pitcher of the Month for August.[18] Hendricks finished the 2016 
season with a record of 16-8 in 190 innings pitched and an ERA of 2.13 
which was the lowest in all of baseball. He was the first Cub to lead the 
National League in the stat since 1945 and the first to lead the majors 
since 1938.[19] In Game 6 of the NLCS, Hendricks pitched 8 1⁄3 innings 
in the clinching game to send the Cubs to their first World Series since 
1945. The Cubs won the 2016 World Series over the Cleveland Indians, with 
Hendricks as the starting pitcher in Games 3 and 7, giving them their first 
title in 108 years.[20] Hendricks throws a sinker (87-90 mph), cutter (86-88 mph), 
changeup (79-81 mph), curveball (76-79 mph) and occasional 4-seam fastball 
(89-91 mph). Hendricks mixes his pitches very well, using all except the 
4-seam with regularity, to both left-handed and right-handed batters. During 
his breakout 2016 campaign, Hendricks became known for his increasing ability 
to locate his pitches and his ability to make all of his offerings move 
with considerable break, the sinker in particular. Hendricks is also known 
for his unique use of a second changeup, which tails glove-side (like a 
curveball or slider) as opposed to down or arm-side like most other changeups. 
The precision of his sinker control and his strong mix of second offerings 
makes up for Hendricks' lack of velocity, and adds up to an average strikeout 
total for a major league starter. Hendricks grew up in San Juan Capistrano, 
California.[21] His father, John, is a golf pro; his mother, Ann Marie, 
is a medical-management consultant.[21] He received his bachelor's degree 
in economics from Dartmouth College in December 2013, after completing 
his coursework in the winter of 2012 and fall of 2013.[4] Hendricks is 
nicknamed "The Professor" by his teammates and fans. The nickname is not 
only a reference to Hendricks' Ivy League education, but also an homage
