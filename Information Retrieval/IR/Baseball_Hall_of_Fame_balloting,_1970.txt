Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1970 followed the system of 
annual elections in place since 1968. The Baseball Writers Association 
of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players 
and elected Lou Boudreau. The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions 
to consider executives, managers, umpires, and earlier major league players. 
It selected three people: Earle Combs, Ford Frick, and Jesse Haines. The 
BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1950 or later, but not 
after 1964; the ballot included candidates from the 1969 ballot who received 
at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, 
chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1964. All 
10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote. Voters were instructed 
to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on 
at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. 
The ballot consisted of 46 players; a total of 300 ballots were cast, with 
225 votes required for election. A total of 2,302 individual votes were 
cast, an average of 7.67 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 
5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots but may eventually 
be considered by the Veterans Committee. Candidates who were eligible for 
the first time are indicated here with a â€ . The one candidate who received 
at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; 
candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated 
in italics. Joe Gordon, Tommy Henrich and Bucky Walters were on the ballot
