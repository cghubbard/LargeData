WBZ (1030 kHz AM) is a Class A (clear channel) radio station, owned and 
operated by CBS Radio and licensed to Boston, Massachusetts. WBZ additionally 
transmits using the HD Radio digital format, and its programming is also 
carried on WBZ-FM's HD3 digital subchannel.[1] The station's studios are 
in Allston, Boston, and its transmitter site is at Hull, Massachusetts. 
WBZ is a designated Primary Entry Point (PEP) for the Emergency Alert System 
(EAS). WBZ currently features an all-news format during the day and talk 
radio at night. Operating with a transmitter power output of 50,000 watts, 
and employing a directional antenna that sends a majority of its signal 
westward, the station can be heard during daylight hours throughout much 
of New England and as far west as the Golden Horseshoe in Southern Ontario, 
Canada. Its nighttime signal covers most of eastern North America. WBZ 
was first licensed on September 15, 1921, and was originally located in 
Springfield, Massachusetts, before moving to Boston in 1931. It is the 
oldest broadcasting station in New England, and one of the oldest stations 
in the United States. WBZ currently runs an all-news format during the 
day and a talk radio format at night. The station was the home of talk 
host David Brudnoy for 18 years, until the day before his death in 2004. 
Other notable personalities included talk show host Bob Kennedy, poet/radio 
host Dick Summer, disc jockeys Bruce Bradley, Jeff Kaye, Ron Landry [2] 
and later, Larry Justice, jazz DJ turned talkmaster Norm Nathan, late-night 
talker and humorist Larry Glick, and morning hosts Carl DeSuze, Tom Bergeron 
and Dave Maynard. It was also the radio home for decades of pioneering 
Boston meteorologist Don Kent. WBZ has long been one of the highest-rated 
stations in the Boston area.[3] It is an affiliate of the co-owned CBS 
Radio Network, as well as ABC News Radio and AP Radio for national and 
international news as well as some features, but the bulk of the station's 
schedule, except some weekend programming, is produced in-house. WBZ has 
also been heavily involved in charitable work, with its annual Christmastime 
fund drive for Boston's Children's Hospital (which it does along with sister 
TV station WBZ-TV) being the most high-profile. In November 1920, the Westinghouse 
Electric & Manufacturing Company established its first broadcasting station, 
KDKA, located in its plant at East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in order to 
promote the sale of radio receivers. This initial station proved successful, 
so in 1921 the company expanded its activities by building three additional 
stations, beginning with WBZ, and followed by WJZ in Newark, New Jersey 
(now WABC in New York City), and KYW, originally in Chicago, Illinois, 
and now in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On September 15, 1921, Westinghouse 
was issued a Limited Commercial license[4] with the randomly assigned call 
letters of WBZ[5] for the new station, transmitting on a wavelength of 
360 meters (833 kHz) with a power of 100 watts,[6] and located at the company's 
East Springfield facility on Page Boulevard. WBZ's inaugural program on 
September 19 was a remote broadcast originating from the Eastern States 
Exposition in West Springfield.[7] At the time WBZ began operations, there 
were no specific government standards for what constituted a broadcasting 
station, and a small number of stations were already providing regularly 
scheduled entertainment broadcasts, most of which operated under Amateur 
or Experimental licenses. (A prime example was the American Radio & Research 
Corporation's experimental station, 1XE in Medford Hillside, Massachusetts 
(near Boston), which was relicensed in early 1922 as WGI.) Effective December 
1, 1921, the U.S. government formally established regulations to define 
a broadcasting station, by setting aside two wavelengths — 360 meters (833 kHz) 
for entertainment, and 485 meters (619 kHz) for official weather and other 
government reports — and requiring the stations to hold a Limited Commercial 
license.[8] WBZ was one of a handful of stations which already met the 
new standard, and in fact its initial license had been the first Limited 
Commercial license that had specified broadcasting on the 360 meter wavelength 
that would be formally designated by the December 1st regulations. By some 
interpretations, this made WBZ the first broadcasting station, and in 1923 
the Department of Commerce, referring to WBZ, stated that "The first broadcasting 
license was issued in September, 1921".[9] However, WBZ's priority is not 
widely recognized,[10] when compared to other stations with earlier heritages, 
in particular KDKA, WWJ in Detroit, Michigan, and KCBS in San Francisco, 
California. By early 1922 WBZ's studios were set up at the luxurious Hotel 
Kimball in Metro Center Springfield.[7] Programs consisted of general entertainment 
and information, including live music (often classical and opera), sports, 
farm reports, special events, and public affairs programming.[7] Despite 
being housed in Springfield's top hotel, the station's location in a mid-sized 
market rendered it somewhat difficult to attract top-flight artists,[6] 
leading Westinghouse to open a remote studio on February 24, 1924 at the 
Hotel Brunswick in Boston.[7] WBZ expanded its news programming via a partnership 
with the Boston Herald and Traveler newspapers,[7] and carried a considerable 
number of sports broadcasts, including Boston Bruins hockey, Boston Braves 
baseball, and Harvard Crimson football.[7] Because of its wide reach, the 
station often referred to itself as "WBZ, New England", as opposed to associating 
itself solely with Springfield or Boston.[7] Even after increasing its 
transmitter power to 2,000 watts by April 1925,[12] the station had difficulty 
reaching Boston listeners.[6] This led Westinghouse to inaugurate, on August 
20, 1925, a 250-watt relay station, WBZA, located in Boston and transmitting 
on 1240 kHz.[7][13] Efforts were soon made to change WBZA to a synchronous 
repeater, transmitting on the same frequency as WBZ, 900 kHz, but the process 
proved difficult, as the two transmitters often interfered with each other, 
even in Boston. For nearly a year while the technology was being perfected 
WBZA shifted between the two transmitting frequencies, before finally going 
to full-time synchronous operation in June 1926.[6] The power of the WBZ 
transmitter in East Springfield continued to be boosted; on March 31, 1926 
it was granted permission to operate with 5,000 watts,[13] and by 1927 
it was operating with 15,000 watts.[14] Meanwhile, a combination of WBZ's 
growth and continued difficulties with the WBZA signal led the station 
to move its Boston studio to the Statler Hotel (now the Boston Park Plaza 
Hotel & Towers) on June 1, 1927[13] and activate a new WBZA transmitter 
on June 9.[7] On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of the Federal 
Radio Commission's (FRC) General Order 40, WBZ and WBZA were assigned exclusive 
national use of a "clear channel" frequency, 990 kHz.[13] Amidst the technical 
changes, WBZ also began engaging in network activities. By 1925, it often 
shared programs with WJZ in New York City (which was transferred from Westinghouse 
to the Radio Corporation of America in May 1923), and a WBZ program commemorating 
the 150th anniversary of Paul Revere's "Midnight Ride" was also fed to 
WRC in Washington, D.C. and WGY in Schenectady, New York.[7] This paved 
the way for the station to become a charter affiliate of the National Broadcasting 
Company (NBC) on November 15, 1926, carrying the WJZ-originated NBC Blue 
Network beginning on January 1, 1927.[13][15] With this change the station 
also began running commercials for the first time; previously Westinghouse 
had financed its stations through the profits from radio receiver sales. 
By 1931, Westinghouse had concluded that WBZ's primary market was Boston, 
so on February 21 the station began using a new transmitter site located 
at Millis,[16][17] chosen to provide service not only to Boston but also 
to Worcester and Providence, Rhode Island.[18] At the same time WBZA was 
transferred from Boston to using the East Springfield transmitter, which 
now operated with 1,000 watts and relayed WBZ's programming to an area 
that was inadequately served by the Millis transmitter.[19][20] The Boston 
studios (which now served as WBZ's main studios) moved as well, relocating 
on July 1, 1931 to the Hotel Bradford;[16] some programs continued to originate 
from the WBZA Springfield studios at the Hotel Kimball.[20] WBZ offered 
its first Boston Marathon coverage on April 19, 1931.[21] The following 
year, Westinghouse leased WBZ and WBZA to NBC, while maintaining ownership 
of the broadcast licenses.[22] During the late 1930s, WBZ began to offer 
more local news coverage; previously, only major events were regularly 
covered.[7] NBC's management of WBZ and WBZA ended on July 1, 1940, and 
Westinghouse resumed full control over the stations.[23] Shortly afterward, 
on July 27,[24] WBZ relocated its transmitter site once more, to its current 
location in Hull,[18] constructing a directional array consisting of two 
160 meter (520 foot) tall towers.[25] The move was twofold: the Millis 
site, 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Boston, had not provided as 
strong a signal to the market as was intended,[18] even after power increases 
to 25,000 watts in 1931 and 50,000 watts in 1933.[7] A key disadvantage 
of the Millis site was that the signal had to travel over land to Boston; 
in contrast the Hull site featured a highly conductive salt water path 
to the city.[18] The Hull site also provided ample space for WBZ's shortwave 
station,[18] which had been founded at Springfield as W1XAZ in November 
1929[13] and later operated from Millis as W1XK, ultimately becoming WBOS.[18] 
WPIT, the shortwave station operated by KDKA in Pittsburgh, also moved 
its transmitters to Hull at this time, and in 1941 its operations were 
folded into WBOS,[18] which soon afterward began carrying government-provided 
programming (a service that ultimately evolved into the Voice of America) 
that would remain the shortwave station's primary function until leaving 
the air permanently in 1953.[18] The Hull site would also serve as the 
home for WBZ's first FM sister station, which operated from there as W1XK, 
W67B, and then WBZ-FM on several frequencies off and on from November 7, 
1940 until November 21, 1948.[26] Under the provisions of the North American 
Regional Broadcasting Agreement, on March 29, 1941 WBZ's "clear channel" 
assignment was shifted to its present frequency, 1030 kHz.[18] WBZ transferred 
from the Blue Network to the NBC Red Network on June 15, 1942;[24][27] 
this allowed the station to retain a link with NBC after the Justice Department 
ordered NBC to divest of one its two radio networks (it opted to sell the 
Blue Network, which became the American Broadcasting Company (ABC)). Like 
other major-market network-affiliated radio stations of the time, WBZ also 
broadcast a few hours of local programming, including Vaudeville-like musical 
performances from Max Zides, Tom Currier, and others, during those hours 
when NBC wasn't feeding programs to affiliates. The station expanded into 
television on June 9, 1948, when WBZ-TV (channel 4) signed on as an NBC 
television affiliate. Westinghouse built new studios at 1170 Soldiers Field 
Road in the Allston section of Boston to house both the radio and television 
stations, with the new facility opening on June 17 of that year (parts 
of the new facility containing the master control and TV transmitter had 
already been in use).[24] The transmission tower built at the studios for 
WBZ-TV would also replace the Hull site as WBZ-FM's transmitter,[18] where 
it remained until Hurricane Carol destroyed the tower on August 31, 1954;[28] 
a power outage caused by the storm would disrupt WBZ's programming for 
three minutes.[29] Don Kent started as a meteorologist at the station in 
1951, for a tenure that would endure for over three decades.[30] The following 
year, WBZ expanded its broadcasting schedule to 24-hour-a-day programming.[30] 
During the 1950s, entertainment shows began moving to television, with 
the amount of music programming increased as a result. After three decades, 
WBZ, along with all but one of the other Westinghouse Broadcasting stations 
(KEX in Portland, Oregon was affiliated with ABC), ended their affiliations 
with NBC Radio on August 26, 1956 following a dispute over the network's 
daytime programming,[31] and the station then decided to program popular 
music around-the-clock. The best known host in WBZ's history, Dave Maynard, 
joined the station in 1958.[30] Another beloved WBZ host was Carl DeSuze, 
who joined WBZ in April 1942[24] and remained at the station until 1985.[32] 
DeSuze was the station's morning man for over three decades. Another popular 
WBZ voice was longtime news anchor Gary LaPierre, who began at the station 
in September 1964.[33] At the outset, WBZ's full-service music format leaned 
toward middle of the road music, but also featuring an increasing amount 
of rock and roll. Within a few years, after the demise of Top 40 WCOP 1150 
AM (now WWDJ) in 1962 and with WMEX as the lone Top 40 in Boston, WBZ switched 
to a full-time top 40 rock and roll format,[34] and with its combination 
of hit music, popular hosts, powerful signal, and top-notch news coverage, 
WBZ was the dominant radio station in the market. It continued to run public 
affairs programming including "Shape-up Boston," "Stomp Smoking" and the 
1969 "T-Group 15," a project produced by public affairs director Jerry 
Wishnow in which nine black and white school-decentralization activists 
in a room for 22 hours with microphones and cameras until compromises were 
reached. The edited broadcast included four hours of audience reaction 
with the participants and was aired on WBZ for 15 hours without commercials.[35][36] 
WBZ re-established an FM station on December 15, 1957, transmitting from 
the brand new WBZ-TV tower in Needham, operating at 106.7 MHz;[37] this 
incarnation of WBZ-FM only provided limited simulcasts of the AM station 
and largely had its own programming, including classical music and Ed Beech's 
Just Jazz program from WRVR in New York City. The station remained in mono 
through this period, but beginning on December 31, 1971, an automated top 
40 format was launched in stereo, apparently in an attempt to blunt the 
popularity of WRKO (680 AM). WBZ-FM would be sold by Group W (which Westinghouse 
had rebranded its broadcasting division in 1963) to Greater Media in 1981, 
ultimately becoming WMJX.[38] WBZA continued to serve Springfield with 
a simulcast of WBZ's programming until July 1962, when it was shut down 
to allow Westinghouse to purchase WINS in New York City, as the company 
already owned seven AM radio stations — the maximum allowed by the Federal 
Communication Commission (FCC) at that time.[39] The closure of WBZA ended 
over 40 years of transmission from East Springfield. The towers continued 
to stand atop the former Westinghouse plant in East Springfield for five 
more decades, until their removal on November 5, 2011 to accommodate redevelopment 
at the site of the factory;[40][41] by then, they were among the oldest 
broadcast facilities still standing.[42] Increased competition in the top 
40 format — first from WMEX (1510 AM), which had programmed a top 40 format 
since 1957, then from WRKO, which adopted the format in 1967 — led WBZ 
to shift its music programming to adult contemporary in 1969, playing several 
songs an hour between 6 and 9 a.m. (though it was not unheard of for Carl 
DeSuze to play only one, if any, song an hour during his show), 10 to 12 
songs an hour between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., and 4 to 6 songs an hour between 
4 and 7 p.m.. At night, WBZ programmed talk shows, with such hosts as Guy 
Mainella, a pioneer in sports talk;[43] Jerry Williams in the evenings; 
and Larry Glick's overnight show (the latter two held the same popular 
shifts at WMEX years earlier). Music was also programmed during the day 
on weekends. This format was similar to sister station KDKA in Pittsburgh. 
By 1978, Mainella, who had been the host of Calling All Sports since its 
inception on July 15, 1969,[33][43] had been replaced with Bob Lobel and 
Upton Bell.[44] Beginning in the late 1960s, WBZ made a major push into 
live play-by-play sports. From 1966 through 1979, and again from 1991 through 
1994, WBZ was home to radio broadcasts of New England Patriots football; 
this brought Gil Santos to the station.[33] In the fall of 1969, WBZ regained 
the radio rights to the Boston Bruins[33] (which it had lost in 1951), 
and also began carrying Boston Celtics basketball. The Bruins stayed through 
the 1977-78 season; the Celtics left WBZ after the team's 1980-81 NBA Championship 
season. During the years when the Bruins and Celtics were both on WBZ and 
both playing at the same time, one of them (usually the Celtics) would 
be heard on WBZ-FM. WBZ also broadcast the United States Football League's 
Boston Breakers during the 1983 season (its lone season in Boston),[45] 
as well as Boston College Eagles football from 1987[46] through 1991.[47] 
Starting in 1972, WBZ's football broadcasts featured the play-by-play team 
of Gil Santos and Gino Cappelletti.[44][45][46] During the 1970s, WBZ was 
one of a number of clear channel AM stations that petitioned to be allowed 
to increase their power; WBZ would have used 500,000 watts transmitting 
from Provincetown, Massachusetts to reach all of New England during the 
day. A backlash from smaller stations led to the petition being denied 
and station protections limited to a 750-mile radius, in effect canceling 
the entire clear channel service.[34] WBZ became an affiliate of ABC Radio 
on January 1, 1980;[32] ABC was the descendant of the Blue Network, which 
WBZ had dropped 38 years earlier. The ABC affiliation allowed the station 
to begin airing Paul Harvey's daily broadcasts, which were previously heard 
in Boston on WEZE (then at 1260 AM, now occupied by WBIX; now at 590 AM) 
and, later, WECB, the carrier current station at Emerson College.[48] Later 
in the year, a schedule shuffle ended Carl DeSuze's run on the morning 
show (which was taken over by Dave Maynard), and he was moved to middays; 
the overnight show was then taken over by Bob Raleigh,[32] who had been 
WBZ's midday host since June 1976.[44] Calling All Sports was also dropped 
in favor of an early evening talk show, hosted at various points by David 
Finnegan, Lou Marcel, and Peter Meade.[49] Former overnight host Larry 
Glick was moved first into late evenings and then into afternoons,[50] 
and ultimately left the station in May 1987.[32] In the 1980s, WBZ began 
to cut back on its music programming; for instance, an expanded afternoon 
news block was launched on December 2, 1985.[32] The following year, David 
Brudnoy began to host the station's late-evening talk show;[32] WBZ replaced 
his program with Tom Snyder's ABC Radio talk show[51] after the July 13, 
1990 broadcast,[52] but listener complaints[53] led the station to return 
Brudnoy to the air by the end of September.[54] It was also late in 1985 
that American Top 40 moved to WBZ from WROR, remaining on WBZ for the rest 
of its years as a full-service AC station, around the same time WBZ's most 
famous slogan, "The Spirit of New England" (made famous by a 1987 JAM Creative 
Productions jingle package of the same name), was introduced. WBZ continued 
its full-service AC format until January 1991, when Gulf War coverage led 
the station to stop playing music on a regular basis and adopt a full-time 
news/talk format.[34][55] WBZ has, from time to time, played music on special 
occasions even after the change to news/talk; the station still offered 
24 hours of Christmas music beginning on Christmas Eve through 1995, and 
it has carried the audio of the Boston Pops' Fourth of July concert and 
fireworks display since 2003;[56] additionally, WBZ, along with sister 
stations WODS and WZLX, carried the Beatles Let It Be... Naked album premiere 
on November 13, 2003.[57][58] When WEEI (then at 590 AM, (now occupied 
by WEZE) now at 850 AM) dropped its all-news format for all-sports programming 
in September 1991, WBZ began a marketing campaign to convince former WEEI 
listeners to switch to WBZ;[59] this was followed on January 13, 1992 with 
a shift to all-news programming during drive time (5 to 10 a.m. and 3 to 
7 p.m. ).[60] On September 28 the station became an all-news station from 
5 a.m.–7 p.m.[61] following the end of the two midday talk shows hosted 
by Tom Bergeron, the morning host prior to the launch of the morning news 
block[62] (the noon hour, which separated the Bergeron shifts, was already 
occupied by a news program); the station's nighttime programming continued 
to be filled by David Brudnoy and Bob Raleigh's talk shows.[61] Initially, 
the new format was not carried over to WBZ's weekend schedule; while a 
weekend morning news block was launched,[61] the weekend afternoon schedule 
remained devoted to specialty talk shows until September 3, 1994, when 
the station introduced information-oriented sports shows, branded as WBZ 
Sports Saturday and WBZ Sports Sunday.[63][64] WBZ's sports commitment 
also included the return of the Boston Bruins Radio Network to the station 
in 1995;[65] however, the station lost the New England Patriots to WBCN 
(104.1 FM, now occupied by WBMX) starting with the 1995 season,[66] and 
for several seasons afterward WBZ was an affiliate of the New York Giants 
Radio Network. NFL regulations only allowed WBZ to carry Giants' games 
not played at the same time as Patriots' games.[67] As with the weekday 
lineup, talk continued to be programmed at night, including three of the 
specialty shows (Kid Company on Saturday evenings and a revived Calling 
All Sports and Looking at the Law on Sunday evenings), a Saturday night 
talk show hosted by Lovell Dyett,[63] and an overnight show with former 
WHDH (850 AM, now occupied by WEEI) host Norm Nathan.[68] WBZ added an 
affiliation with the CBS Radio Network on March 6, 1995, making it one 
of a handful of stations to carry both CBS Radio and ABC Radio (however, 
the station ceased an affiliation with CNN Radio).[69] Five months later, 
on August 1, Westinghouse announced that it was purchasing CBS,[70] a transaction 
that was completed on November 24;[71] as a result, WBZ came under the 
CBS Radio banner.[34] 76 years of Westinghouse ownership would come to 
an end on December 1, 1997, when the Westinghouse Electric Corporation 
changed its name to CBS Corporation.[72] CBS' radio stations, including 
WBZ, were spun off into a new public company, Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, 
in 1998 (a move that removed the Group W name from the station's license);[73] 
Viacom announced its acquisition of the publicly held stake in Infinity 
on August 15, 2000 (shortly after it merged with CBS Corporation),[74] 
a transaction completed on February 21, 2001 (though Viacom, and CBS before 
the merger, had always held a majority stake in Infinity).[75] Even after 
coming under common ownership with the CBS Radio Network, it would not 
be until 2000 before CBS' hourly newscast replaced ABC's during WBZ's overnight 
programming.[34] As its ownership shifted, WBZ also continued to modify 
its program schedule. After Norm Nathan's death on October 29, 1996,[68] 
his Friday night/Saturday morning show was taken over by Steve LeVeille, 
and his Saturday night/Sunday morning show went to former WSSH-FM (99.5 
FM, now WCRB) morning host Jordan Rich.[76] Bob Lobel (by now WBZ-TV's 
sports director) and Upton Bell returned to the station on May 17, 1997 
for a Sunday night sports show (with Calling All Sports moving to Saturdays).[77] 
Another sports show, The McDonoughs on Sports with Sean McDonough and Will 
McDonough aired during the 1997 NFL season as a lead-in to CBS Radio Sports' 
broadcast of Monday Night Football, preempting David Brudnoy's program;[78] 
the first two hours of his Friday show were also preempted in favor of 
a cooking show, Olives' Table with Todd English, from August 1997[79] through 
August 1998.[80] The Sports Saturday and Sports Sunday blocks were discontinued 
in April 1998 in favor of an expansion of the all-news format to weekend 
afternoons;[81] Calling All Sports and The Bob Lobel Show were not affected,[82] 
though Lobel's show was replaced with Sunday Sports Page with Dan Roche 
and Steve DeOssie that July after a management-ordered cut-off of a call 
on the July 12 broadcast drove Lobel to resign from his show on July 13.[83][84] 
Bob Raleigh began to cut back his on-air presence during the late 1990s, 
with Kevin Sowyrda taking over the Sunday night/Monday morning slot for 
a time;[76] he eventually retired on June 9, 1999,[85] with Steve LeVeille 
taking his place in the overnight hours and Jordan Rich taking over the 
Friday night/Saturday morning show.[86] Shortly afterward, David Brudnoy 
gave up the 10 p.m.-12 a.m. portion of his show;[85] this timeslot was 
given to Lowell Sun columnist and former WLLH (1400 AM) host Paul Sullivan.[87] 
For a time starting in the fall of 2001, the station relaunched the 1 p.m. 
hour of the Midday News as the WBZ Business Hour, with an increased focus 
on business news;[88] this program was similar to one on Los Angeles sister 
station KNX (WBZ has since returned to regular news in the 1 p.m. hour). 
Later that year, weekend sports talk was abandoned completely, with Calling 
All Sports, which had been a leased-time program owned and produced by 
Norm Resha since its revival in 1991,[89] moving to WTKK (96.9 FM) on December 
2.[43] WBZ then launched a Saturday evening talk show hosted by Pat Desmarais, 
while a simulcast of the CBS television program 60 Minutes was added on 
Sunday evenings on January 13, 2002.[90] David Brudnoy announced on September 
23, 2003 that he had skin cancer[91][92] (he had also been fighting AIDS 
since 1994[65]); a farewell broadcast aired on December 8, 2004, and he 
died the next day, with tribute shows airing over the following two nights.[93] 
Per Brudnoy's wish, Paul Sullivan took over the 8 p.m.–midnight time slot 
in January 2005, with the 7 p.m. hour given to an expansion of the WBZ 
Afternoon News.[93] That March, WBZ began streaming its programming on 
the web, along with Infinity's other news and talk stations.[94] When Viacom 
split into two companies on December 31, 2005, Infinity became part of 
the new CBS Corporation and reverted to the CBS Radio name.[95] That same 
day, WBZ dropped Paul Harvey after the station's contract to carry his 
broadcasts expired (however, despite coming under the CBS Radio banner 
once more, the station still maintains an affiliation with ABC News Radio);[96] 
in addition, the station dropped Looking at the Law, a legal advice show 
hosted by Neil Chayet, after its January 8, 2006 broadcast in favor of 
brokered financial programs.[97] Longtime morning news anchor Gary LaPierre, 
who anchored WBZ's morning newscasts for nearly 40 years, retired from 
WBZ at the end of 2006. Governor Mitt Romney declared the day of his final 
broadcast, December 29, 2006, "Gary LaPierre Day". Romney, Senator Ted 
Kennedy, Mayor Tom Menino, former Mayor Ray Flynn, former Governor Michael 
Dukakis, and other notables called in during his final broadcast.[98] LaPierre 
was replaced on the WBZ Morning News with Ed Walsh, a former morning host 
at WOR in New York City who had been anchoring at WCBS,[99] starting with 
the 9:30 a.m. half-hour of the December 29 Morning News.[98] LaPierre continues 
to be heard on the station on occasion through voiceover work.[100] Meanwhile, 
evening host Paul Sullivan was fighting a brain tumor, which was discovered 
on November 22, 2004—shortly before Brudnoy's death.[101] After undergoing 
several surgeries over the next two and a half years, Sullivan announced 
on June 21, 2007 that he would step down from the evening talk show,[102] 
with his final show, led by Jordan Rich, airing on June 28;[100] he died 
on September 9.[103] Rich and WBZ-TV reporter Dan Rea served as substitute 
hosts in the interim;[102] on October 1, Rea, who in the 1970s served as 
a weekend host for the station before moving to television in 1976, became 
the new host of the show, renamed NightSide with Dan Rea.[104] On December 
31, 2008, WBZ let go overnight talk show host Steve LeVeille, sports anchor 
Tom Cuddy and Saturday night talk show hosts Lovell Dyett[105] and Pat 
Desmarais.[106] LeVeille was replaced by Jon Grayson (whose show originates 
from St. Louis sister station KMOX), while Dyett and Desmarais were replaced 
by the syndicated Kim Komando Show. After listener efforts were made to 
restore LeVeille and Dyett to the station, WBZ announced on January 27, 
2009 that LeVeille would reassume his shift on February 2, while Dyett 
would host a half-hour early morning public affairs program on Sundays.[107] 
Cuddy would subsequently return to the station as well that May.[108] While 
Jordan Rich retained his weekend overnight show, the 2–5 a.m. portion of 
the program began to be simulcast on sister station WCCO in Minneapolis–Saint 
Paul. Long-time sports director Gil Santos retired after 38 years with 
the station on January 30, 2006; after a week-long fill-in by Bob Lobel,[109] 
Walt Perkins took over as morning sports anchor on February 7.[110] The 
Bruins once again left WBZ following the 2008-09 season, after CBS Radio 
launched a third incarnation of WBZ-FM at 98.5 MHz as an all-sports station, 
which also took the Patriots from the former WBCN.[111] (The station simulcast 
WBZ-FM's broadcast of Game 7 of the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals between the 
Bruins and the Vancouver Canucks, allowing fans in areas of New England 
not served by a Bruins radio network affiliate to hear the game;[112] additionally, 
WBZ briefly carried Bruins games that conflict with WBZ-FM's Patriots broadcasts, 
a function that has since moved to WZLX. WBZ also carried a Boston Celtics 
broadcast on January 11, 2014, due to conflicts with both a Patriots game 
on current Celtics flagship station WBZ-FM and a Bruins game on WZLX.[113]) 
Ed Walsh retired after four years as morning news anchor on November 30, 
2010;[114] Rod Fritz then took over as interim anchor (with Gary LaPierre 
guest anchoring for a week in early December),[115] with Joe Mathieu, formerly 
of Sirius XM Radio's P.O.T.U.S. channel, taking over on May 16, 2011.[116][117] 
The station added a monthly one-hour interview show hosted by Mathieu, 
WBZ Newswatch, on January 26, 2012.[118][119] Overnight host Steve LeVeille 
retired from WBZ on June 8, 2012;[120] after a year of rotating guest hosts 
that included Jennifer Brien, Morgan White Jr., Bradley Jay, and Dean Johnson, 
Brien was named the new host on June 25, 2013.[121] On October 3, 2013 
the station announced it was canceling the Jen Brien Show with immediate 
effect. [122] Bradley Jay now has the overnight chair, with the show renamed 
"Jay Talking". In February 2007, the station created the WBZ Radio Hall 
of Fame. Gary LaPierre was the first inductee, on February 16;[123] Gil 
Santos was the second when he was inducted on July 9, 2009,[124] and Dave 
Maynard was the third with his induction on September 15, 2009.[125] Carl 
DeSuze became the fourth inductee (and the first to be inducted posthumously) 
on September 19, 2011, coinciding with WBZ's 90th anniversary.[126] WBZ 
received the 2010 Marconi award in the legendary stations category from 
the National Association of Broadcasters.[127] In 2014, WBZ, along with 
sister station WBZ-TV, received a Peabody Award for its coverage of the 
Boston Marathon bombings.[128] 1 = Clear-channel stations with extended
