Jamie Moyer (born November 18, 1962) is an American former professional 
baseball pitcher. Over his 25-year career in Major League Baseball (MLB), 
Moyer pitched for the Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, St. Louis Cardinals, 
Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox, Seattle Mariners, Philadelphia Phillies, 
and Colorado Rockies. He was inducted into the Mariners Hall of Fame in 
2015.[1] At the time of his final game, he was the oldest player in the 
major leagues and had the most wins, losses, and strikeouts of any active 
MLB pitcher. He was likened to Phil Niekro.[2][3][4] On April 17, 2012, 
Moyer became the oldest pitcher in MLB history to win a game. On May 16, 
2012, he broke his own winning-pitcher record and also set the record for 
the oldest MLB player to record a run batted in (RBI). He also holds the 
Major League record for most home runs allowed with 522. Moyer made the 
All-Star team in 2003, while with the Mariners. Moyer has received numerous 
awards for philanthropy and community service, including the 2003 Roberto 
Clemente Award, the 2003 Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, the 2003 Hutch Award, 
and the 2004 Branch Rickey Award. Moyer is one of only 29 players in baseball 
history to date to have appeared in MLB games in four decades. At the time 
of his retirement, Moyer had faced 8.9% of all MLB hitters ever.[5] Moyer 
attended Souderton Area High School in Souderton, Pennsylvania, where he 
played baseball, basketball, and golf. Moyer pitched at Saint Joseph's 
University, where in 1984 he set the school's single-season records in 
wins, with 16, earned run average (ERA), with 1.99, and strikeouts, with 
90.[6] In 1997 he became the only Saint Joseph's baseball player to have 
his jersey number, number 10, retired,[6] and was one of three inductees 
into the first class of the St. Joseph's Baseball Hall of Fame. The Chicago 
Cubs selected Moyer in the sixth round of the 1984 amateur draft. Moyer 
was selected a New York–Penn League All-Star in 1984. He made his major 
league debut with the Cubs on June 16, 1986, against Steve Carlton and 
the Philadelphia Phillies, and earned his first win. Later that year, on 
August 16, he threw his first shutout against the Montreal Expos. He was 
also the starting pitcher for the Cubs on the day that Greg Maddux made 
his major league debut. In 1987, Moyer ranked tenth in the National League 
in strikeouts with 147, while winning 12 games. Following his then-best 
season in 1988, he was traded to the Texas Rangers as part of the 9-player 
Rafael Palmeiro for Mitch Williams trade. Moyer was on the disabled list 
with a sore left shoulder for much of a disappointing 1989 season. 1990 
saw Moyer spend time in the bullpen before regaining a spot in the starting 
rotation. Moyer was released as a free agent after the 1990 season and 
was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals. He made seven starts for the Cardinals 
in 1991 before being sent to the minor leagues on May 24, and was released 
on October 14. In 1992, Moyer went to spring training with the Chicago 
Cubs, but was released and spent the rest of the season in the minor league 
system of the Detroit Tigers. On December 18, 1992, Moyer signed with the 
Baltimore Orioles. Moyer began the 1993 season in the Oriole minor leagues, 
before being called up on May 30. He tied his career-high total in wins 
with 12 and a new career-low ERA of 3.43. The strike-shortened 1994 season 
was disappointing for him, but he was third on the staff in innings pitched. 
In 1995, Moyer again found himself in the Baltimore bullpen, but worked 
his way back into the starting rotation. Moyer was signed by the Boston 
Red Sox on January 2, 1996. Moyer appeared in 23 games for Boston, making 
10 starts. In the middle of the 1996 season, he was traded to the Seattle 
Mariners on July 30, for outfielder Darren Bragg. In Seattle he started 
11 games and went 6–2. His record of 13–3 led the majors in winning percentage 
at .813. In 1997, Moyer was fifth in the American League with 17 wins. 
His 17–5 record gave him the second-highest winning percentage (.773) in 
the league. Moyer made his first postseason start against his former club 
Baltimore, but was forced out with a strained elbow in the fifth inning. 
In 1998, Moyer went 15–9 with a 3.53 ERA. He was third in innings pitched 
with 234.1. He registered his 100th career win against the Cleveland Indians 
on August 27, as well as his 1000th career strikeout with a sixth inning 
strikeout of David Bell. He was named Seattle's Pitcher of the Year by 
the Seattle chapter of the BBWAA. He walked two or fewer batters in 29 
of his 32 starts. He ranked fourth in the American League averaging just 
1.9 walks per nine innings. Moyer was also third among the league in innings 
pitched and seventh winning percentage. He matched his career-best seven-game 
winning streak from May 11 to July 7. He started the Inaugural Game at 
Safeco Field on July 15 against the San Diego Padres, throwing a called 
strike to San Diego's Quilvio Veras for the first pitch and getting a no-decision 
in Seattle's 3–2 loss after leaving with a 2–1 lead after eight innings.[7] 
He defeated Baltimore for the ninth straight time on July 31; he did not 
lose to the Orioles in the 1990s. Moyer's only loss at Safeco came on August 
5 against the New York Yankees. He recorded three complete games in the 
final month of the season, tossing back-to-back complete games on September 
14 and 19. His 2.30 ERA after the All-Star break was the second-lowest 
among AL starters, behind only Pedro Martínez with his 2.01 ERA. He pitched 
4 complete games for the second straight season, tying his career best. 
In 1999, Moyer went 14–8 with a 3.87 ERA and was voted to The Sporting 
News AL All-Star team. He again won the Seattle Pitcher of the Year award. 
2000 saw Moyer rebound from an early shoulder injury to tally 13 wins, 
giving him at least 13 in each of his past five seasons. He made his first 
Opening Day start for Seattle, but lost to the Boston Red Sox 2–0 on April 
4. His shoulder problems led his ERA to balloon to 5.49. A knee injury[8] 
suffered on the last pitch of a simulated game caused him to miss Seattle's 
trip to the American League Championship Series against the eventual World 
Series champion New York Yankees. Moyer lost five consecutive starts from 
August 4–24. He allowed a career-high and a club-record 11 earned runs 
in a 19–3 loss on August 9 against the Chicago White Sox. He allowed 11 
runs, 6 earned, in a 14–4 loss on August 14 against the Detroit Tigers, 
joining the Houston Astros' José Lima as the first two pitchers since 1950 
to allow ten or more runs in consecutive starts. Moyer allowed a career-high 
seven walks in a no-decision on August 29 against the Yankees. The Mariners' 
7–2 win on September 9 against the Minnesota Twins snapped a six-game losing 
streak. Moyer lasted just one and two-thirds innings in his final start, 
getting a no-decision September 28 against the Texas Rangers. Moyer suffered 
a hairline fracture of left kneecap while pitching a simulated game on 
October 7. In 2001 Moyer won 20 games, ranked tied for second in the American 
League, and his 3.43 ERA was sixth in the AL. He earned his 150th career 
win against the Texas Rangers on September 24. He became only the second 
Mariner in history to win 20 games on October 5, former teammate Randy 
Johnson being the other. Moyer went 3–0 with a 1.89 ERA in the postseason. 
He won Games 2 and 5 for the Mariners against the Cleveland Indians and 
also carried Game 3 against the New York Yankees before Seattle lost in 
Game 5. In 2002, Moyer went 13–8 with a then career low 3.32 ERA. Although 
he pitched 20 more innings and had a lower ERA than in 2001, he won seven 
fewer games. Moyer was fourth in the AL in innings with 230.2. He was tied 
for second in the league with 34 starts, fifth in opponents' batting average, 
holding opposing hitters to a .230 clip, and ninth in ERA with 3.32. He 
tossed a team-high 24 consecutive scoreless innings from June 16 to July 
6. He averaged just two walks per nine innings pitched, tied for sixth-best 
in the AL. The Mariners were 20–14 in his starts. His four complete games 
tied his career high, also done in 1998 and 1999. He threw his seventh 
career complete game shutout, first of the season, on June 10 against the 
St. Louis Cardinals in a 10–0 win. Moyer's start on June 16 against San 
Diego began a streak of 24 consecutive shutout innings over four starts. 
He finished June 3–1 with a Major League best 1.01 ERA in five starts. 
He collected his 1,500th career strikeout August 24 against the Cleveland 
Indians. In 2003, Moyer won a career high 21 games, lost 7, and had a career 
low 3.27 ERA. He tied for second in the American League for wins and was 
sixth in ERA. His .750 winning percentage placed him fourth in the league 
and his 21 wins are a club record. He became the only Seattle pitcher to 
win 20 games more than once. Moyer was voted to his first All-Star Game 
in 2003. He was named for the third time the Seattle Pitcher of the Year. 
Moyer was also the winner of the Roberto Clemente Award, given annually 
to the big leaguer whose success on the field is mirrored by his impact 
in community service, The Hutch Award, presented annually by the world-renowned 
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to an MLB player displaying "honor, 
courage and dedication to baseball, both on and off the field", and The 
Lou Gehrig Award, presented annually to the MLB player who both on and 
off the field best exemplifies the character of Lou Gehrig. In 2004, Moyer 
went 7–13 and posted his first losing record since 1994. His ERA was 5.21 
and he surrendered an MLB-leading 44 home runs. While the year started 
well for him, going 5–0 with a 1.59 ERA from May 20 – June 18, Moyer ended 
2004 on a 10-game losing streak. He threw the slowest fastball of all AL 
starters, averaging 81.6 mph.[9] One positive for Moyer was he was awarded 
the Branch Rickey Award for his exceptional community service following 
the season. During the 2005 season Moyer passed Randy Johnson to become 
the winningest pitcher for the Mariners on May 30. On July 8, 2005, Moyer 
became the 25th southpaw to win 200 games in Major League Baseball. He 
finished with a 13–7 record and for the second year in a row he threw the 
slowest fastball of all major league starters, averaging 81.7 mph.[10] 
On June 18, 2006, he became the 33rd man to start 500 major league games. 
In his 11 seasons with the Mariners, Moyer had a record of 145–87 with 
a 3.97 ERA in 324 games (323 starts). He is the franchise leader in wins, 
starts and innings pitched. Moyer is also one of the all-time leaders in 
1–0 complete game losses. Moyer has lost eight games having surrendered 
only one run over nine innings. Before being traded in August 2006, he 
was the oldest active American League player. On August 19, 2006, Moyer 
was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for minor league pitchers Andrew 
Barb and Andrew Baldwin. In his first start with the Phillies, Moyer set 
a franchise record as the oldest pitcher to record a win. In eight starts 
with the Phillies in 2006, Moyer went 5–2 with a 4.03 ERA. After the season, 
Moyer signed a two-year extension worth $10.5 million with the Phillies 
on October 23.[11] On April 13, 2007, at age 44 Moyer combined with Tom 
Glavine to become the oldest matchup of lefty starters (85 years, 163 days) 
in major league history. He struck out six batters in the game which included 
his 2000th batter. Later that month, on April 29 Moyer pitched a two-hitter 
through 7 1⁄3 innings as he recorded a win against the Florida Marlins. 
On July 21, at age 44, Moyer broke that same record when he combined with 
David Wells to become the oldest match up of lefty starters (88 years, 
307 days) in major league history. Moyer won the game and Wells lost; the 
oldest over the youngest by 183 days. In the finale to the 2007 season, 
Tom Glavine and Moyer faced off respectively in separate games to determine 
the National League Eastern Division Champions, as the division lead was 
tied at 88 wins. Moyer defeated the Washington Nationals, pitching 5 1⁄3 
innings and surrendering no runs, and three hits, while Glavine was crushed 
by the Marlins at Shea Stadium, surrendering seven runs in the first inning, 
hitting a batter with the bases loaded and recording only a single out 
before being pulled.[12] He threw the slowest fastball of all NL starters 
in 2007, averaging 81.1 miles per hour (130.5 km/h).[13] In 2008, at age 
45, Moyer became the oldest active player in Major League baseball. On 
April 30, Moyer hit a single off Padres pitcher Chris Young into left center 
field to become the oldest Phillie ever to get a hit.[14][15] On May 26, 
Moyer won his 235th career game, giving him at least one victory over each 
Major League team. The victory came in a 20–5 win over the Colorado Rockies. 
Moyer pitched seven innings, struck out seven batters, and gave up four 
runs. He followed that in his next start against the Florida Marlins by 
earning his sixth victory of the season, pitching seven innings and giving 
up five runs. On September 11, Moyer won his 14th game of the season against 
the Milwaukee Brewers, which began the Phillies a seven-game win streak. 
On September 27, Moyer took the mound for the Phillies against the Nationals, 
in a game where the Phillies could clinch the National League East title 
with a win. Moyer pitched six innings and gave up only one run and the 
Phillies won the game 4–3. Moyer earned his 16th win of the year, the second-oldest 
pitcher to accomplish this feat, finishing with a 3.71 ERA. He also threw 
the slowest fastball of all NL starters in 2008, averaging 81.2 miles per 
hour.[16] He threw cutters 29.5% of the time, the highest rate in the NL.[16] 
On October 4 against the Milwaukee Brewers in the 2008 National League 
Division Series, Moyer became the second-oldest pitcher to ever start a 
post-season game at the age of 45 years 321 days, and the oldest since 
1929 when Jack Quinn started for the Philadelphia Athletics at 46 years 
103 days. On October 12, Moyer became the oldest pitcher at 45 years 329 
days to pitch in a National League Championship Series game, starting in 
Game 3 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. However, he struggled during the 
game and surrendered six runs in 1 1⁄3 innings—his shortest start in over 
eight years—and went on to lose the game. On October 25, Moyer made his 
first World Series start against the Tampa Bay Rays, pitching 6 1⁄3 innings, 
giving up three runs, and receiving a no-decision. More impressive was 
that he pitched with a severe stomach virus.[17] He won his first World 
Series ring when the Phillies defeated the Rays on October 29 in his 23rd 
Major League Season. Following the game, the pitchers mound at Citizens 
Bank Park was dug up and given to Moyer by his teammates. In his speech 
at the World Series celebration at Citizens Bank Park on October 31, he 
related to the fans that he grew up as a Phillies fan and played hooky 
from Souderton Area High School to attend the Phillies' championship parade 
in 1980. On December 15, 2008 Moyer signed a two-year, $16 million contract 
with the Phillies, keeping him with the club through the conclusion of 
the 2010 season.[18] Moyer started the season with a 3–5 record and a 7.42 
ERA,[19] but earned his 250th career win on May 31 against the Washington 
Nationals in a 4–2 win, becoming the 44th pitcher and the 11th lefty to 
do this.[20] By the All-Star break, Moyer had improved his record to 8–6 
and had lowered his ERA to 5.99. On July 16, Moyer won his 255th career 
game, pitching a one-hitter through seven scoreless innings and passing 
Jack Morris for 41st on the all-time wins list. Despite leading the rotation 
with ten wins, Moyer carried a still inflated 5.47 ERA. This prompted the 
Phillies to move him to the bullpen to make room in their rotation for 
Pedro Martínez.[21] Regarding the move, manager Charlie Manuel said, Jamie 
was a total professional and team player when we let him know of the decision 
to move him to the bullpen. He has been, and will continue to be, a very 
important part of this team.[21] In Moyer's bullpen debut on August 18, 
he relieved Martínez in the fourth inning after a rain delay, pitching 
six scoreless innings to earn his 11th win of the season. A similar situation 
occurred on August 28, as Moyer again relieved Martinez in the third inning 
after a rain delay. He pitched four and one third innings in relief, giving 
up one earned run and picked up his 12th win of the season. Moyer tore 
three muscles in his groin and lower abdomen while pitching against the 
Houston Astros on September 29. He missed the rest of the regular season, 
and was not on the Phillies' postseason roster.[22] When asked about retiring 
after the expiration of his Phillies contract at the end of 2010, Moyer 
said, "You know, I'm going to leave that as an open-ended question because 
I don't know how to answer that. It could be (my last season). It potentially 
could be. But so could have last year. So could have two years ago, so 
could have five years ago."[23] After the retirement of Ken Griffey, Jr. 
in early 2010, Moyer and Omar Vizquel were the last two active players 
in MLB who played in the 1980s. On April 10, at age 47, Moyer became the 
sixth-oldest pitcher to appear in a game and the eighth major league pitcher 
to start a game in four different decades. Moyer pitched six innings and 
earned his 259th career victory.[24] On May 7, Moyer became the oldest 
player in Major League Baseball history (47 years, 170 days) to pitch a 
shutout, blanking the Braves on two hits, striking out five batters and 
walking none.[25] Moyer also became the only MLB pitcher to throw a shutout 
in four different decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s). On June 5, 
Moyer became the third MLB pitcher to win 100 games after turning 40 years 
old, defeating the San Diego Padres, 6–2, using just 98 pitches to accomplish 
the feat. It was also his second complete game of the season. On June 16, 
Moyer became the oldest pitcher to ever defeat the New York Yankees. Moyer 
beat the Yankees at 47 years, 210 days. The previous oldest pitcher to 
beat them was Phil Niekro at 47 years, 122 days, according to the Griffin 
Sports Bureau. On June 27, he became the all-time major league leader in 
home runs allowed (506), passing Robin Roberts. On July 20, Moyer left 
a start against the St. Louis Cardinals due to an elbow strain after pitching 
only one inning.[26] The injury proved to be a sprain in his ulnar collateral 
ligament and a strain of his flexor pronator, which resulted in Moyer missing 
the remainder of the 2010 season.[27] After the 2010 season, Moyer's contract 
expired and he was removed from the Phillies' 40-man roster.[28] He then 
went to the Dominican Winter Leagues to pitch where he suffered another 
elbow injury on November 6, 2010, which ended his chance of playing in 
2011.[29] He had Tommy John surgery on December 1, 2010, in New York, to 
repair the ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow, in hopes to make a comeback 
in 2012.[30] During his recovery from Tommy John surgery, Moyer worked 
for ESPN. On January 18, 2012, Moyer signed a minor-league contract (with 
an invitation to spring training) with the Colorado Rockies, a team that 
did not exist when he made his MLB debut in 1986.[31] The March 30 NBC 
Nightly News reported that Moyer made the opening day roster for the Rockies, 
and would be the number-two starter in the rotation. The report was confirmed 
the following day by the Associated Press.[32] He made his Rockies debut 
on April 7 against the Houston Astros. He pitched 5 innings, giving up 
three runs, and received the loss. On April 17, Jamie Moyer became the 
oldest pitcher in MLB history to earn a win. The previous record was held 
by Jack Quinn, who earned his last win in 1932, two months after his 49th 
birthday.[33] Moyer became the oldest player in MLB history to record an 
RBI on May 16 when he singled in two runs in the 4th inning against the 
Arizona Diamondbacks. He also extended his record for the oldest pitcher 
to record a win. Five days later, Moyer started for the Rockies against 
the Marlins at Marlins Park. This appearance represented the 50th MLB stadium 
Moyer has pitched in, the most of any pitcher to debut since 1900. Target 
Field in Minnesota is the only active stadium in which Moyer has not pitched.[34] 
On June 1, the Rockies released Moyer, making him a free agent and eligible 
to sign with any team.[35] Moyer signed a minor league deal with the Baltimore 
Orioles on June 6, five days after being released by the Rockies. The deal 
came with the stipulation that he would make three starts with the Triple-A 
Norfolk Tides, and after that the Orioles had to promote him or grant his 
release. Following his third start on June 23, the Orioles offered Moyer 
another start with the Tides. He instead opted to become a free agent. 
With the Tides, Moyer went 1–1 with a 1.69 ERA with 16 strike outs in 16 
innings over three games. He also demonstrated exceptional control as he 
did not walk a batter and allowed only eleven hits. The Orioles liked what 
they saw, but the timing just wasn't right to add him to the rotation. 
"We're very appreciative of him giving us that opportunity to look", Baltimore 
manager Buck Showalter said. "I wouldn't be surprised to see him pitch 
for somebody shortly. Personally, just out of respect for his career what 
he's done, I hope it happens."[36] Moyer signed a minor league contract 
with the Toronto Blue Jays after being released by the Orioles.[37] Moyer 
made his first start for the Blue Jays Triple-A team, the Las Vegas 51s, 
on June 28. Moyer got the win, pitching 5 innings and giving up 3 runs 
on 7 hits, with 6 strikeouts and 1 walk.[38] Moyer's second start was a 
loss to the Reno Aces, in which he yielded 7 runs on 10 hits through 6 
innings. In his planned 2 starts with Las Vegas, Moyer posted a 1–1 record 
with an 8.18 ERA through 11 innings. Moyer did not travel back to Las Vegas 
at the end of the second game.[39] On July 5, he was released by Toronto.[40] 
On September 7, it was reported that Moyer was attempting a comeback as 
a knuckleball pitcher, having consulted with Charlie Hough and Tim Wakefield 
over the summer.[41] Moyer announced the end of his baseball-playing career 
during an interview with Dave Davies on National Public Radio's Fresh Air 
broadcast that aired October 2, 2013. During the interview on Fresh Air 
he also announced his intention to start a pitching academy, The Moyer 
Pitching Academy, as well as continue his charitable work with The Moyer 
Foundation, but that he would be open to an offer to coach in the major 
leagues.[42] Moyer has written his memoir, with Larry Platt, entitled Just 
Tell Me I Can't: How Jamie Moyer Defied the Radar Gun and Defeated Time. 
Moyer dedicated the book, and also sees the academy as a tribute, to the 
memory of the late counselor and author Harvey Dorfman, who helped shape 
Moyer's "mental game."[43] On February 11, 2014, Moyer and fellow former 
Phillie Matt Stairs were announced to join the Phillies' television broadcast 
crew as color analysts for the 2014 season. Moyer and Stairs joined in-game 
reporter Gregg Murphy and play-by-play voice Tom McCarthy.[44] Following 
the season, Moyer announced he would not return to the booth in 2015, citing 
a desire to spend more time with his family.[45] Moyer's pitching approach 
evolved as he aged. Most pitchers lose velocity later in their career, 
and Moyer was no exception – his average fastball speed in 2012 was about 
80 MPH, a very slow speed for a non-knuckleball pitcher. Instead of velocity, 
Moyer relied on control and mixing his pitches. He threw five main pitches: 
a sinker, a cut fastball, a slider, a changeup, and a curveball. Moyer, 
after spending many of his playing years living in Seattle, moved to Florida 
with his wife Karen (the daughter of former Notre Dame basketball coach 
and current ESPN sportscaster Digger Phelps) and their eight children.[46] 
The Moyers' two youngest daughters were adopted from Guatemala.[47] In 
1996, Moyer earned a Bachelor of General Studies degree from Indiana University. 
Jamie and Karen Moyer, who were introduced by Harry Caray when Jamie was 
with the Cubs and Karen was an intern with Cubs broadcast outlet WGN,[33] 
are devout Roman Catholics.[48][49] They are philanthropists in the Northwest 
with their work done through the Moyer Foundation, a non-profit organization 
dedicated to helping children in severe distress. Moyer's oldest son Dillon 
was drafted in the 22nd round of the 2010 MLB draft by the Minnesota Twins 
but did not sign and instead attended UC Irvine [50] for two years. He 
transferred to UC San Diego [51] for his Junior, and final, year, as he 
graduated in three years with a major in Sociology and minor in Education.[51] 
He was later drafted in the 38th round of the 2013 MLB draft by the Los 
Angeles Dodgers and did sign with them.[52] Another son, Hutton, was drafted
