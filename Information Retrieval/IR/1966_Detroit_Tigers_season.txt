The 1966 Detroit Tigers season was the 66th consecutive season for the 
Detroit franchise in the American League. The Tigers, who had finished 
fourth in the ten-team AL in 1965 with an 89–73 record, won one fewer game 
in 1966, going 88–74, but moved up to third in the league, ten full games 
behind the eventual world champion Baltimore Orioles. The 1966 season saw 
the maturation of the core of the 1968 world champion Tiger club, and the 
addition of starting pitcher Earl Wilson, a future 20-game winner. But 
it was marred by the in-season illnesses, ultimately fatal, that struck 
manager Chuck Dressen and his immediate successor, interim pilot Bob Swift. 
Dressen, 71, suffered a heart attack on May 16 (his second heart attack 
in two years), with Detroit 16–10, three games behind the Cleveland Indians. 
He was admitted to a Detroit hospital and third-base coach Swift, 51, took 
the reins as acting manager, as he had done in 1965. Under Swift, the Tigers 
won 32 of their next 57 games. But during the July 11–13 All-Star break, 
with Detroit in second place, eight games behind Baltimore, Swift was hospitalized 
for rapid weight loss and what was first suspected to be food poisoning. 
However, tests revealed that he was suffering from lung cancer and he was 
forced to step aside. Dressen died August 10, and Swift succumbed October 
17. Another Tiger coach, Frank Skaff, finished the season as acting manager, 
with the team playing only one game above the .500 mark for him, at 40–39. 
The Tigers eventually hired Mayo Smith as their new manager for 1967, and 
Smith would lead them to within one game of the 1967 pennant and the 1968 
world title. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Infielders Coaches
