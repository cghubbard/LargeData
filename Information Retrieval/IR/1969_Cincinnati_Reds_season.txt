The 1969 Cincinnati Reds season was a season in American baseball. It consisted 
of the Reds finishing in third place in the newly established National 
League West, four games behind the NL West champion Atlanta Braves. The 
Reds were managed by Dave Bristol, and played their home games at Crosley 
Field, which was in its final full season of operation, before moving into 
their new facility in the middle of the following season. 1969 not only 
marked the 100th anniversary of the original Cincinnati Red Stockings being 
the first fully professional baseball team, but it also marked the first 
year of divisional play in Major League Baseball. The Reds (along with 
the Atlanta Braves) were placed in the NL West division, despite being 
located further east than the 2 westernmost teams in the NL East division, 
the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals. This was because the New York 
Mets wanted to be in the same division as the reigning power in the NL, 
which were the Cardinals at the time (to compensate for playing against 
the Dodgers and Giants fewer times each season). The Cubs consequently 
demanded to be in the NL East as well in order to continue playing in the 
same division as the Cardinals, one of the Cubs' biggest rivals. A side 
effect of this alignment is that it set the stage for what is considered 
one of the greatest pennant races – and comebacks in such a race – in MLB 
history (see 1969 New York Mets season for more info). Infielders Other
