Charles Leonard Gehringer (May 11, 1903 – January 21, 1993), nicknamed 
"The Mechanical Man", was a German-American Major League Baseball second 
baseman who played 19 seasons (1924–42) for the Detroit Tigers.[1] He was 
elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1949. Widely regarded as one of 
the greatest second basemen of all time, Gehringer, who batted left-handed 
and threw with his right, compiled a .320 batting average and had seven 
seasons with more than 200 hits. He was the American League batting champion 
in 1937 with a .371 average and was also named the American League's Most 
Valuable Player. He was among the Top 10 vote recipients in the Most Valuable 
Player voting for seven straight years from 1932 to 1938. He was the starting 
second baseman and played every inning of the first six All Star Games. 
Gehringer's career totals of 2,839 hits and 574 doubles both rank 19th 
in major league history. Gehringer also led the Tigers to three American 
League pennants (1934, 1935, and 1940) and one World Series Championship 
(1935). Gehringer hit .379 in the 1934 World Series, and .375 in the 1935 
Series. Gehringer was also one of the best-fielding second basemen in history, 
having led all American League second basemen in fielding percentage and 
assists seven times. His 7,068 assists is the second highest total in major 
league history for a second baseman. He also collected 5,369 putouts as 
a second baseman (the 6th highest total for a second baseman) and 1,444 
double plays (the 7th highest total for a second baseman). Known for his 
consistency as a hitter and fielder, Gehringer was given the nickname "The 
Mechanical Man" by Yankee pitcher Lefty Gomez.[2] Teammate Doc Cramer quipped: 
"You wind him up Opening Day and forget him."[3] A durable player, Gehringer 
had two consecutive game streaks of more than 500 games—one from 1927 to 
1931 and the other from 1931 to 1935.[4] Career statistics Gehringer was 
born on May 11, 1903 on a rented farm in Iosco Township, south west of 
Fowlerville, Michigan, in southwestern Livingston County, Michigan.[5] 
He was the second son of Leonard Gehringer and Theresa (Hahn) (Eisele) 
Gehringer, both German Catholic immigrants. Both of his parents had been 
married previously, and Charlie had eight half-siblings from Leonard's 
first marriage, and a half-sister from his mother's first marriage. As 
a young boy the family moved to a different rented farm just south of Fowlerville, 
Michigan in Handy Township, Michigan.[5] In 1922 after graduating from 
Fowlerville High School, he enrolled at the University of Michigan, about 
30 miles from the family farm. Gehringer took physical education classes 
and played basketball and baseball. Gehringer later recalled that he lettered 
in basketball but not baseball.[2] In the fall of 1923, after his first 
year at the University of Michigan, Gehringer was discovered by Detroit 
Tigers left fielder Bobby Veach. Veach heard about Gehringer, and brought 
him down to Navin Field to work out for a week and show the Tigers what 
he could do. (Anthony Connor, "Voices from Cooperstown" (1982), p. 37) 
Player-manager Ty Cobb was reportedly so impressed with Gehringer that 
he asked club owner Frank Navin to sign Gehringer to a contract on the 
spot. "I knew Charlie would hit and I was so anxious to sign him that I 
didn't even take the time to change out of my uniform before rushing him 
into the front office to sign a contract." Ty Cobb [6] In 1924, Gehringer 
played with London Tecumsehs in the Class B Michigan Ontario League. He 
was called up briefly at the end of September and played five games for 
the Tigers, batting .462 in 13 at-bats. Nevertheless, the 21-year-old Gehringer 
returned to the minor leagues where he played in 1925 for the Toronto Maple 
Leafs of the International League, and 8 games with the Tigers. Gehringer's 
first full season in the big leagues was 1926, which was also Ty Cobb's 
last season as the Tigers' player-manager. At first, Gehringer recalled 
that Cobb "was like a father to me." Gehringer's father had died in 1924. 
Cobb even made Gehringer use his own bat. According to Gehringer, Cobb's 
bat was "a thin little thing", and though Gehringer would have preferred 
a bigger bat, "I didn't dare use another one." [7] Gehringer hit .277 in 
his first full season, and collected 17 triples (2nd best in the American 
League). Cobb and Gehringer subsequently had a falling out, and Gehringer 
later described Cobb as "a real hateful guy." (Al Stump, Cobb: The Life 
and Times of the Meanest Man Who Ever Played Baseball (1994), p. 419) Playing 
for the "small ball" oriented Cobb, Gehringer also had a career-high 27 
sacrifice hits in 1926. Six Tigers from the Cobb era (Donie Bush, Ty Cobb, 
Harry Heilmann, Bobby Veach, Sam Crawford, and Ossie Vitt) rank in the 
Top 50 all time for sacrifice hits.[8] After Cobb's departure, Gehringer 
never again came close to 27 sacrifice hits. In 1927, the Tigers had a 
new manager in George Moriarty and a lineup full of great hitters, including 
Heinie Manush, Harry Heilmann, Lu Blue, and Bob Fothergill. The 1927 season 
was also the beginning of Gehringer's many seasons as a reliable .300 hitter. 
In 1927, he hit .317 and scored 110 runs – 4th best in the American League. 
He also led American League second basemen with 438 assists and 84 double 
plays. In 1928, he played in all 154 games for the Tigers, hit .320, collected 
193 hits (5th best in the league), scored 108 runs (5th best in the league), 
and had 507 assists (best in the league for a second baseman). At the end 
of the 1928 season, Gehringer placed 19th in the voting for the American 
League's Most Valuable Player. Gehringer's steady improvement as a hitter 
continued in 1929, as he hit .339 with an on-base percentage of .405, a 
slugging percentage of .532, and 106 RBIs. He also led the American League 
in many offensive categories, including hits (215), doubles (45), triples 
(19, including 3 in one game), runs (131), and stolen bases (27). He also 
led the league in putouts (404) and fielding percentage (.975) by a second 
basemen. Gehringer's consecutive game streak continued as he played in 
every game of the 1928, 1929, and 1930 seasons. In 1930, he hit .330 with 
a .404 on-base percentage and a .534 slugging percentage (9th best in the 
American League). He also scored 144 runs (3rd best in the league) and 
collected 201 hits, 78 extra base hits, 47 doubles (3rd in the league), 
15 triples (5th in the league), and 19 stolen bases (2nd in the league). 
Each year from 1926 to 1930, Gehringer improved his statistics in the three 
triple crown categories (batting average, home runs and RBIs). The only 
other player to do that for five years running is Rogers Hornsby.[4] In 
relative terms, 1931 was an "off" year for Gehringer. His consecutive game 
streak ended, as he played in 101 games. He also fell below the .300 mark 
(batting .298) for the only time between 1926 and 1941. Gehringer still 
had a fine year by most standards, and ended up No. 17 in the 1931 American 
League MVP voting. In 1932, Gehringer was back at full strength, playing 
in 152 games and hitting .325 with 112 runs, 107 RBIs, and 44 doubles (2nd 
best in the league). Not generally known a power hitter, Gehringer even 
hit 19 home runs in 1932, 7th best in the American League. At the end of 
the year, Gehringer was 9th in the league's MVP voting. In 1933, the "Mechanical 
Man" continued his string of consistent seasons, playing in 155 games, 
batting .330 (5th best in the American League), and collecting 204 hits 
(2nd in the league), 42 doubles (4th in the league), 105 RBIs, and a career-high 
542 assists (best in the league for 2nd basemen). Gehringer was once again 
among the top vote recipients in the 1933 MVP voting, this time placing 
6th. Gehringer had a reputation as quiet and unassuming. Player-manager 
Mickey Cochrane joked that "Charlie says `hello' on Opening Day, `goodbye' 
on closing day, and in between hits .350."[9] Gehringer acknowledged his 
quiet demeanor: "I wasn't a rabble rouser. I wasn't a big noisemaker in 
the infield, which a lot of managers think you've got to be or you're not 
showing. But I don't think it contributes much." Gehringer also had a sense 
of humor about his reputation. At a civic banquet in his honor, Gehringer's 
entire speech consisted of the following: "I'm known around baseball as 
saying very little, and I'm not going to spoil my reputation." When asked 
why he signed his name "Chas. Gehringer", he responded: "Why use seven 
letters when four will do?" On another occasion, when asked about his closed-lip 
reputation, he responded: "Not true; if somebody asked me a question, I 
would answer them. If they said, 'Pass the salt,' I would pass the salt." 
His unassuming nature is also reflected in his reaction to a "Charlie Gehringer 
Day" held by the Tigers in 1929. Fans from Gehringer's hometown and throughout 
Detroit filled the stands for a 17–13 win over the Yankees. Gehringer handled 
10 chances at second base, had four hits including a home run, and stole 
home. In a ceremony, the people of Fowlerville presented Gehringer with 
a set of golf clubs. Though the clubs were right-handed, and Gehringer 
was left-handed, Gehringer learned to golf right-handed rather than trade 
for a left-handed set of clubs.[10] In 1934, Gehringer had his best year 
to date, playing all 154 games and leading the Tigers to their first American 
League pennant in 25 years. His .356 batting average and .450 on-base percentage 
were both 2nd best in the league. He led the league in runs scored with 
134 and hits with 214. He was also among the league leaders in doubles 
with 42 (2nd best in the league) and RBIs with a career-high 127 (5th best 
in the league). Gehringer finished 2nd in the American League MVP voting, 
just 2 points behind Detroit's player-manager, Mickey Cochrane. The Detroit 
infield in the mid-1930s was one of the best-hitting combinations in major 
league history. With Hank Greenberg at first, Gehringer at second, Billy 
Rogell at shortstop, and Marv Owen at third, the 1934 Tigers infield collected 
769 hits (214 by Gehringer, 201 by Greenberg, 179 by Owen and 175 by Rogell), 
462 RBIs (139 by Greenberg, 127 by Gehringer, 100 by Rogell, and 96 by 
Owen), and 179 doubles (63 by Greenberg, 50 by Gehringer, 34 by Owen and 
32 by Rogell). Three members of the 1934 Tigers infield (Gehringer, Owen 
and Rogell) played in all 154 games, and the fourth (Greenberg) played 
in 153. Gehringer's 127 RBIs in 1934 is all the more remarkable given the 
fact that he played in the same lineup with one of the greatest RBI men 
of all time, Hank Greenberg. Gehringer later recalled that Greenberg would 
tell him: "Just get the runner over to third", so Hank could drive them 
in. Gehringer noted that "Hank loved those RBIs", to the point that Gehringer 
once kidded Greenberg: "You'd trip a runner coming around third base just 
so you could knock him in yourself." [11] The 1934 World Series was a match-up 
between St. Louis's "Gashouse Gang" and Detroit's' "G-Men" (so named because 
of stars Gehringer, Hank Greenberg, and Goose Goslin). Even 50 years later, 
Gehringer (interviewed in 1982) felt the Tigers were robbed of the 1934 
championship by umpire Brick Owens. Detroit was ahead 3 games to 2, and 
in Gehringer's view "we should've won the sixth game." Late in the game, 
Brick Owens called Mickey Cochrane out on a play at third base "even though 
all of the photographs show that he was safe by a mile." Gehringer insisted 
that, if Cochrane had been called safe, "we would've had the bases loaded 
with nobody out and we could've had a big inning." [12] The Tigers wound 
up losing Game 6 by one run. They then lost Game 7 in an 11–0 shutout thrown 
by Dizzy Dean, despite a 2-for-4 game from Gehringer. Gehringer can't be 
faulted for the World Series loss, as he played all seven games, batting 
.379 with an on-base percentage of .438 and a .517 slugging percentage. 
In 1935, Gehringer and the Tigers won a World Series, beating the Chicago 
Cubs 4 games to 2. It was the Tigers' first-ever World Series win, after 
failing in the fall classic in four previous appearances. For the year, 
Gehringer hit .330 with a .409 on-base percentage and a .502 slugging percentage, 
collecting 201 hits, 123 runs, 108 RBIs, and 19 home runs. Once again, 
Gehringer was among the top vote getters in the MVP race, again losing 
to one of his own teammates, Hank Greenberg. Gehringer also continued his 
consistent hitting into the 1935 World Series, where he played all six 
games, and hit .375 with a .423 on-base percentage, a .500 slugging percentage 
and 4 RBIs. After the 1934 season, Gehringer was part of the Major League 
All Star tour of Japan. The American team included Gehringer, Babe Ruth, 
Lou Gehrig, and Jimmie Foxx. They played 18 games against a Japanese All 
Star Team. The American team won all 18 games by a combined score of 189 
to 39, but on November 20, 1934, 17-year-old Eiji Sawamura pitched seven 
shutout innings and had consecutive strikeouts of Gehringer, Ruth, Gehrig, 
and Foxx.[13] Gehringer recalled that, during batting practice, the Japanese 
fans would fill the 60,000 seat ballpark for every game. (Anthony Connor, 
"Voices from Cooperstown", p. 240.) During the off-season, Gehringer worked 
as a sales clerk in the downtown Detroit Hudson's. He also spent many years 
barnstorming with other Major League players. One year, he traveled with 
a touring group from the Negro Leagues, including Satchel Paige, Buck Leonard, 
Judy Johnson, and Mule Suttles. Gehringer recalled that trying to hit Paige's 
fastball and hesitation pitch was "no fun." Paige said that Gehringer was 
the best white hitter he ever pitched against.[14] Although the 1936 Tigers 
finished in second place, 19½ games behind the Yankees, the 33-year-old 
Gehringer may have had his best season. He led the American League in assists, 
double plays, and fielding percentage by a second baseman. And he had career-bests 
in hits (227) slugging percentage (.555), runs (144), extra base hits (87), 
total bases (356) and runs created (152). He also had a career-low 13 strikeouts 
in 641 at-bats during the 1936 season. That equates to a strikeout every 
49.3 times at bat. He finished 4th in the MVP voting, as Lou Gehrig became 
the only non-Tiger to win the MVP award from 1934 to 1937. Gehringer finally 
secured his own American League Most Valuable Player trophy, and a batting 
crown, in 1937. Gehringer won the batting championship with a career-high 
.371 batting average and placed 2nd in on-base percentage with another 
career-high .458. The 1937 season also saw Gehringer collect 209 hits (his 
7th 200 hit season) and score 133 runs (one of twelve 100-plus run seasons). 
In 1938, Gehringer had another solid year, batting .306 with a .425 on-base 
percentage (6th-best in the American League), 133 runs (3rd-best in the 
league), and career-highs in bases on balls with 113 (4th-best in the league), 
and home runs with 20. Gehringer finished 10th in MVP voting in 1938. Gehringer 
played over 1,000 games with Billy Rogell as his double play partner at 
shortstop, making them one of the longest-tenured double-play combinations 
in the history of the game. The two twice led the league in double plays. 
(Another Tiger duo, Lou Whitaker and Alan Trammell, holds the major league 
record with 1,918 games played as a double-play combination.) Rogell's 
fiery demeanor was a stark contrast to the calm, quiet demeanor of Gehringer. 
On one occasion, after both failed to cover second on a steal attempt, 
player-manager Mickey Cochrane charged out from behind the plate shouting 
at Rogell and Gehringer. As reported in The New Bill James Historical Baseball 
Abstract: "Rogell, astonished, looked at Gehringer to see if he was going 
to say anything. Gehringer, of course, had nothing to say. 'Goddamn you,' 
yelled Rogell. 'Don't you come charging out here telling me how to play 
shortstop. You go back there and do the catching, and I'll play shortstop. 
If I'm not good enough, you can find someone else.' Cochrane went back 
to his own position." Although he missed a number of games in the 1939 
and 1940 seasons, he continued to hit above .300, batting .325 in 1939 
and .313 in 1940. The 1940 season also saw the Tigers return to the World 
Series after four straight years of dominance by the Yankees. Gehringer 
finished 14th in the MVP voting in 1939 and dropped to 23rd in 1940. Gehringer 
hit .214 in 28 at-bats in a losing effort in the 1940 World Series against 
the Cincinnati Reds. In 1941, Gehringer's 17 seasons began to catch up 
with him. His batting average dropped almost 100 points to .220, but with 
95 walks (5th-best in the American League) his on-base percentage remained 
high at .363. In 1942, Gehringer lost the starting second baseman's job 
to a young Billy Hitchcock. Gehringer played only three games at 2nd base 
in 1942, finding himself relegated to a pinch-hitting role. He hit .267 
with a .365 on-base percentage in his final year. Gehringer enlisted in 
the U.S. Navy after the 1942 season. He served three years, and was released 
in 1945. Gehringer considered making a comeback at age 41. "I came out 
of the service in such good shape that I felt I could've played a few years."[15] 
Instead, Gehringer went into business selling fabrics to automobile manufacturers. 
In 1949, Gehringer was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Baseball 
Writers. Gehringer received 159 votes on 187 ballots (85.03%). During his 
major league career, Gehringer lived with his mother in Detroit. Gehringer's 
father died in 1924, and Gehringer moved her from the family farm outside 
Fowlerville, Michigan, to Detroit. Gehringer recalled that she was a diabetic 
and "needed someone to look after her."[10] Gehringer speculated that he 
might have married earlier (he didn't marry until he was 42) "but I couldn't 
see bringing a wife into that kind of situation." Gehringer noted that 
his mother was a "great fan" who would either come out to the ballpark 
to watch her son play or listen to Harry Heilmann's radio broadcasts on 
the porch.[10] Gehringer did not marry until after his mother died, and 
when he did get married in 1949, he did not let anything stand in the way—not 
even his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Gehringer missed his 
Hall of Fame induction ceremony on June 13, 1949, because he did not want 
it to interfere with his wedding, which was to take place five days later. 
Charlie Gehringer is a cousin of retired Hall of Fame pitcher John Smoltz. 
Smoltz stated "My grandmother was a Gehringer" during the Detroit Tigers 
vs. New York Yankees game broadcast on June 11, 2016, and added "I got 
a chance to play golf with him, when I think he was 81 years old, and he 
might have shot his age!" (meaning, Charlie scored an 81 after 18 holes 
of golf). In 1950, Tigers owner, Walter Briggs asked Gehringer to be the 
Tigers general manager, and he agreed to do so. Gehringer later said that 
the job was a "nightmare." As he put it: "We had a lousy ball club, and 
I'd been away from baseball at that time for ten years. I didn't know who 
was and who wasn't." [10] After serving as the Tigers general manager from 
1951 to 1953, Gehringer was given the title of Tigers vice president in 
the mid-1950s.[16] He went back to his business selling fabric to the automobile 
companies, continuing with the company until 1974 when he sold his interest 
in the business. Gehringer also served as a member of the Baseball Hall 
of Fame Committee on Veterans from 1953 to 1990. At a 1983 ceremony in 
Tiger Stadium, the Tigers retired uniform numbers 2 and 5 worn for many 
years by teammates Gehringer and Hank Greenberg.[17] Both players attended 
the ceremony. At age 82, Gehringer served as the American League honorary 
captain at the 1986 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at the Astrodome 
in Houston, Texas. Gehringer died in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, at age 
89. In 1999, he ranked Number 46 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest 
Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League 
Baseball All-Century Team. Also in 1999, Sports Illustrated published a 
list of "The 50 Greatest Sports Figures From Michigan" (in all sports), 
and ranked Gehringer third on the list behind Joe Louis and Magic Johnson.
