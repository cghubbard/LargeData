The Philadelphia Phillies' 2010 season was the 128th season in the history 
of the franchise. As the two-time defending National League champion—having 
appeared in the 2008 and 2009 World Series—the Phillies won their fourth 
consecutive National League East championship, and also finished with the 
best record in baseball. After sweeping the Cincinnati Reds in the NLDS, 
however, the team lost to the San Francisco Giants in the NLCS. The Phillies 
announced, following the 2009 World Series, that they would pick up their 
1-year, $9 million option on starting pitcher Cliff Lee, who posted a 4–0 
record in the previous postseason.[1] General manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. 
informed pitcher Brett Myers, who had started and relieved in 2009 and 
sustained several injuries, that the Phillies would not pursue him for 
a new contract if he filed for free agency. Myers had started the last 
three opening days for the Phillies.[2] Starting pitcher Pedro Martínez 
and infielder Miguel Cairo also filed for free agency on November 6, the 
first possible date.[3] Philadelphia also informed third baseman Pedro 
Feliz that they declined to pick up his option for the 2010 season, which 
would have retained him for $5.5 million. The Phillies signed free-agent 
catcher Brian Schneider to replace Paul Bako behind Carlos Ruiz on the 
depth chart,[4] and replaced Feliz at third base with Plácido Polanco, 
who played second base for Philadelphia from 2002 to 2005, and was a Gold 
Glove-winning second baseman for the prior two seasons with the Detroit 
Tigers.[5] Polanco had previously played third base in college, when playing 
with the St. Louis Cardinals, and in Philadelphia when David Bell was injured 
and Chase Utley took over at second base.[6] With Lee under contract for 
one year, the Phillies traded his rights to the Seattle Mariners, from 
whom they received three prospects, including Tyson Gillies and Phillippe 
Aumont. In a related deal, the Phillies traded three prospects to the Toronto 
Blue Jays for the rights to right-handed starting pitcher Roy Halladay, 
as well as $6 million cash to cover the difference between the two aces' 
salaries. The trade for Halladay included a 3-year, $60 million contract 
extension through 2013 with an option for a 4th season.[7] The trade was 
the "first of its kind" in the history of the league, the only deal wherein 
two past winners of the Cy Young Award changed hands in related transactions.[8] 
To complete their bench, the Phillies signed utility infielder Juan Castro 
to a one-year contract to replace Eric Bruntlett,[9] and inked a two-year 
deal with pinch-hitter and first baseman Ross Gload, who replaced Matt 
Stairs.[10] In the bullpen, the Phillies signed right-handed relief pitcher 
Danys Báez to a two-year contract,[11] and agreed to a one-year deal with 
right-handed starter and long reliever José Contreras.[12] Amaro announced 
that all of the coaches from the 2009 season had also been invited to return.[1] 
The Phillies opened their 2010 Grapefruit League play against the New York 
Yankees, defeating them 3–2; Halladay pitched two innings in the opener 
against CC Sabathia, striking out three and throwing 21 of 24 pitches for 
strikes.[13] In total, the Phillies went 13–12 in spring training,[14] 
where a position battle occurred for the fifth spot in the starting rotation 
between left-handed veteran Jamie Moyer and young right-hander Kyle Kendrick. 
The team announced on March 30 that Moyer had won the fifth position based 
on his Grapefruit League performance (1–0, 0.77 earned run average (ERA) 
in 11 2⁄3 innings).[15] However, Kendrick's performance (0–1, 1.66 ERA 
in 21 2⁄3 innings)[15] also moved him into the rotation after an oblique 
injury to third starter Joe Blanton.[16] Closer Brad Lidge and left-handed 
specialist J. C. Romero also ended spring training on the disabled list 
after offseason surgeries.[16] The Phillies opened the season on the road 
for the first time since the opening of Citizens Bank Park in 2004; they 
defeated the Washington Nationals in their first game of the season, 11–1, 
behind seven innings from Roy Halladay and a grand slam from Plácido Polanco.[17] 
Ryan Howard moved into a tie for fifth place on the franchise's all-time 
home run list by hitting his 223rd, matching Greg Luzinski's career total.[18] 
He passed Luzinski the following day with a two-run home run to center 
field off of Jason Marquis in Philadelphia's 8–4 victory, sealing the team's 
first 2–0 start since the 2003 season.[19] They did not complete the sweep, 
however, as the Nationals won the third game of the series, 6–5, after 
newly acquired relief pitcher Nelson Figueroa allowed an RBI double to 
Ryan Zimmerman in the seventh inning.[20] The Phillies took sole possession 
of first place by defeating the Houston Astros in the opener of their second 
series on April 9, defeating Brad Mills' new club, 8–0; Raúl Ibáñez broke 
out of a spring slump by collecting three hits and a walk in four official 
at bats.[21] Jamie Moyer's first start of the season resulted in the Phillies' 
fourth win, backed by another Howard home run; Philadelphia scored 41 runs 
in their first 5 games.[22] A complete-game victory for Halladay in his 
second Phillies start sealed the series sweep for Philadelphia, as they 
defeated the Astros, 2–1, on April 11. Halladay notched both the 150th 
win and 50th complete game of his career.[23] In the home opener against 
Washington, Jimmy Rollins was scratched from the starting lineup due to 
a calf strain—which later sent him to the disabled list[24]—and Jayson 
Werth left the game in the fourth inning with a sore hip; however, the 
Phillies scored five runs in the fifth inning to come from behind and defeat 
the Nationals, giving Hamels his second victory of the season.[25] Figueroa 
earned his first victory as a Phillie on April 14 when Philadelphia defeated 
Washington in the second game of the series, 14–7; their 7–1 start was 
the best to open a season since 1993, when they appeared in that year's 
World Series against the Toronto Blue Jays.[26] The bullpen, however, allowed 
a 4–2 lead to turn into a 7–5 loss in the final game of the series; Danys 
Báez allowed three runs on home runs by Adam Dunn and Zimmerman to take 
the loss.[27] Opening the final series of the homestand against the Florida 
Marlins, manager Charlie Manuel switched starters Moyer and Halladay in 
the rotation to keep the latter on normal rest;[28] Halladay responded 
by allowing two runs in eight innings in an 8–6 victory, supported by Chase 
Utley's fourth consecutive contest with a home run.[29] The Marlins defeated 
the Phillies in the second game of the series, 5–1, as Moyer allowed five 
runs in the first inning and the Phillies' only run came on a late-game 
home run by Jayson Werth.[30] The Marlins took the rubber game of the series 
with a 2–0 shutout despite eight innings of two-run baseball by Cole Hamels.[31] 
Kyle Kendrick followed Hamels' performance with eight shutout innings on 
April 20, allowing four hits and walking two, but interim closer Ryan Madson 
allowed back-to-back home runs with two outs in the ninth inning to tie 
the game and José Contreras gave up another home run in the tenth, sealing 
the Phillies' third consecutive loss.[32] The next night, Halladay posted 
the third straight strong performance by the Phillies' rotation, and played 
the role of stopper by holding the Braves scoreless on five hits to notch 
his second complete game of the season and the sixteenth shutout of his 
career. With the win, Halladay became the first pitcher of the season to 
reach a 4–0 record.[33] The rotation's streak of innings without allowing 
an earned run extended to 23, as Moyer allowed two unearned runs in six 
innings; the Phillies won the game, 8–3, and the series, two games to one.[34] 
The streak was broken, however, the following night, as Hamels allowed 
four home runs in the span of two innings, and the Phillies lost to the 
Arizona Diamondbacks in their first trip west, 7–4.[35] Figueroa made a 
spot start for the injured J. A. Happ in the second game against Arizona, 
throwing 100 pitches in 5 innings of work;[36] Contreras earned his first 
win of the season in the 3–2 Phillies victory.[37] However, the Phillies 
could not earn their fourth consecutive road series victory, as the Diamondbacks 
defeated Philadelphia, 8–6, after Arizona scored five runs in the fifth 
inning of the rubber game.[38] Continuing play against the National League 
West, Halladay started against the San Francisco Giants, but lost his first 
decision of the season, 5–1, as the Phillies left 22 men on base.[39] The 
offense fared no better in the second game of the series, ensuring the 
second straight series loss with a 6–2 defeat. The loss dropped the Phillies 
out of first place for the first time all season, ending a streak of 135 
consecutive games at the top of the division dating back to May 29, 2009.[40] 
They managed to avoid being swept for the first time by defeating the Giants 
in 11 innings on April 28, 7–6; starter Tim Lincecum, winner of the last 
two National League Cy Young Awards, allowed one run and struck out eleven 
Phillies through 8 1⁄3 innings, but a bases-loaded double by Werth against 
Brian Wilson tied the game in the bottom of the ninth inning and Wilson 
Valdez batted in the winning run in the eleventh.[41] In the game, Utley 
became the 5th Phillies player in the last 20 years, and the 32nd in franchise 
history, to reach 1,000 career hits, with a single to right field.[42] 
Philadelphia closed the month with their first game of the year against 
the division-rival New York Mets, losing 9–1 to finish with a 12–10 record 
in the opening month.[43] Continuing the series with the Mets from the 
previous month, Halladay completed his second shutout of the season, striking 
out six batters in a 10–0 victory.[44] The Phillies returned to first place 
in the division with an 11–5 victory in the series' final game, capped 
by a grand slam by Victorino; the 10 runs scored against Mets starter Johan 
Santana were the most allowed in a start in his career.[45] Joe Blanton 
returned to the starting rotation for his first game of the season; though 
he allowed one run on seven hits in 6 2⁄3 innings before being relieved, 
the Phillies lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in their series opener, 6–3, 
after the bullpen allowed three inherited runners to score.[46] Carlos 
Ruiz hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 10th inning to win the 
second game of the series for Philadelphia, after Hamels and Adam Wainwright 
battled to a stalemate, each throwing eight innings of one-run baseball.[47] 
Home runs by Victorino and Polanco the following evening sealed a second 
straight victory for the Phillies behind seven scoreless innings from Kendrick.[48] 
Every starter in the lineup got at least one hit in the final game of the 
series, save Halladay, who pitched seven innings and allowed two runs. 
The offense was paced by Werth and Ruiz, who each went 3-for-4 in the game.[49][50] 
Werth later said that his three-run home run in the first inning was "big 
ups to Robin [Roberts]", the Hall of Fame Phillies pitcher who died that 
morning, and who shared Werth's hometown of Springfield, Illinois.[49] 
Werth hit another three-run home run on May 7 against the Braves to back 
a two-hit, no-walk shutout by Moyer, who became the oldest pitcher in Major 
League Baseball history to throw a complete game without allowing a run.[51] 
The Phillies lost the second game of the series, 4–1, as Blanton took his 
second consecutive loss since returning from the disabled list,[52] but 
came back to win the series with a 5–3 victory in Sunday's contest; Victorino, 
Polanco, and Werth hit home runs, and Brad Lidge earned his first save 
of the 2010 campaign.[53] Playing at Coors Field to open the team's second 
trip to the National League West, the Phillies scored four runs in the 
ninth inning to win the series opener against the Colorado Rockies, 9–5. 
Victorino hit two triples, and Ruiz notched four hits, including a home 
run, in five at-bats, the highest single-game total of his career.[54] 
After weather on May 11 forced a day-night doubleheader the following day, 
the Rockies defeated Philadelphia, 4–3, on a walk-off home run by Miguel 
Olivo; the second game was postponed again due to additional rain and snow. 
The Phillies lost Ruiz to a knee injury in the game, sent Lidge back to 
Philadelphia for tests on his right elbow,[55] and were chastised before 
the game by Major League Baseball for potentially stealing signs.[56] Next, 
the team traveled to Wisconsin to face off against the Milwaukee Brewers, 
taking the first game of the series, 9–5, from former Phillie Randy Wolf; 
Utley, Howard and Ibáñez each hit a home run in the contest, and Victorino 
batted in three runs.[57] With Madson and Lidge both on the disabled list, 
Contreras assumed the closer's role and earned his first career save in 
a 10–6 Phillies victory on May 15.[58] The team completed the sweep with 
a 4–2 victory on May 16 behind 6 2⁄3 innings and an RBI double from Hamels.[59] 
A three-run home run from Werth and a late-inning grand slam from Howard 
gave the Phillies a 12–2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 17, 
supporting a career-best eight-inning performance from Kendrick; the pair 
of batters drove in the 10 runs that were the difference in the final score.[60] 
The two-game series against Pittsburgh ended in a split, however, as Halladay's 
two-run complete game on May 18 was overshadowed by six innings of one-run 
baseball pitched by Zach Duke, handing the Phillies their fourth loss of 
the month.[61] The team lost consecutive games for the first time in May, 
as they fell to the Chicago Cubs the following day, 4–1,[62] but notched 
a second consecutive series split when Ibáñez drove in the winning run 
in the eighth inning of the May 20 contest.[63] Philadelphia opened interleague 
play against the Boston Red Sox on May 21, defeating them, 5–1; J. C. Romero 
collected his second save of the season to close Hamels' fifth victory, 
and Werth hit a home run to the second deck in left field.[64] Boston's 
Daisuke Matsuzaka nearly no-hit the Phillies in the second game until Juan 
Castro singled with two outs in the eighth inning; it was Philadelphia's 
only hit of the game, as they were defeated, 5–0.[65] The Red Sox took 
the final game, 8–3, by scoring six earned runs against Halladay, his second 
consecutive loss and the most runs allowed in a start by the right-hander 
so far during the season.[66] Traveling to New York for their second series 
against the Mets, the Phillies were shut out in consecutive games: 8–0 
on May 25 by knuckleballer R. A. Dickey;[67] and 5–0 on May 26 by Hisanori 
Takahashi.[68] Philadelphia was held scoreless for 37 of 38 consecutive 
innings, with the only runs coming in the final inning of the last game 
against Boston,[68] and increased that total to 46 of 47 after being shut 
out again in the final game of the series, 3–0;[69] the Phillies became 
the first defending league champion in Major League Baseball history not 
to score a run in a three-game series. It was the first time Philadelphia 
was shut out in three consecutive games since 1983, the season that they 
lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series.[70] The streak ended 
at 30 consecutive innings (49 of 50) when the Phillies scored in the fourth 
inning of the May 28 contest to open the Memorial Day weekend series with 
Florida; they defeated the Marlins, 3–2, after taking their first lead 
in a game in a week.[71] Philadelphia completed its second consecutive 
victory in a pitcher's duel between Halladay and Marlins ace Josh Johnson; 
Johnson allowed only an unearned run through seven innings, but Halladay 
pitched the 20th perfect game in major league history, and the second in 
franchise history (Jim Bunning), striking out 11 and retiring all 27 Florida 
batters in order.[72] The tables were turned the following afternoon as 
the Marlins shut out the Phillies, 1–0, behind Aníbal Sánchez,[73] and 
the month was finished with a 9–3 loss to Atlanta.[74] Philadelphia opened 
the third month of the season by breaking a 68-inning streak in which no 
Phillie had hit a home run; Howard's two-run shot in the sixth inning was 
one of ten hits for the team, but the Braves defeated them, 7–3.[75] The 
final game of the series did not bring the Phillies a win. Although Kendrick 
pitched seven innings—recording the three outs of the seventh on four pitches—and 
allowed only one run, the Braves scored their second run against Contreras 
in the eighth inning to win the game, 2–1; it was Atlanta's eighth consecutive 
victory.[76] After a day off, the Phillies defeated the San Diego Padres 
in consecutive games in the Friars' only visit of the season to Philadelphia; 
Halladay won his eighth decision in a 3–2 victory on June 4,[77] and Moyer 
followed by becoming the third pitcher to win 100 games after the age of 
40 (Jack Quinn, Phil Niekro) in a complete-game win on June 5.[78] After 
scoring five runs against Padres starter Kevin Correia in less than two 
innings in the third game, San Diego's bullpen pitched 8 1⁄3 scoreless 
frames as Philadelphia was defeated in extra innings, 6–5.[79] After Hamels 
lost a potential no-hitter in the seventh inning on June 7, the Phillies 
settled for a split with the Padres as they lost, 3–1.[80] The score seesawed 
back and forth in the first game of the next series with Florida. Ben Francisco 
made an error in the outfield and grounded into two double plays before 
batting in the winning run in the bottom of the eighth inning; the final 
score was 10–8.[81] After the second scheduled game of the series was cancelled 
due to poor weather conditions, the Marlins won the final game, 2–0; Johnson 
and Halladay matched up for the first time since the latter's perfect game 
two weeks prior, and the former left as the victor after pitching eight 
scoreless innings.[82] In the second round of interleague play, the Phillies 
faced the Red Sox for the second time. In the first two games, the Phillies 
allowed 22 runs in 12–2 and 10–2 losses; Moyer and Blanton, as the starting 
pitchers, became the fourth set of pitchers in franchise history to allow 
eight or more earned runs in the first three innings of consecutive games, 
and the first pair since 1895.[83] Philadelphia took the final game of 
the series to collect their second interleague win of the season, defeating 
Boston, 5–3, behind a four-run inning by the Phillie offense.[84] In a 
rematch of both the 1950 World Series and the previous season's Fall Classic, 
the Phillies traveled north to face the New York Yankees for a three-game 
series beginning on June 16; they were defeated in the series opener, 8–3, 
although Halladay, who started the game, had been 18–6 with a 2.84 earned 
run average against the Yankees in his career.[85] Howard and Werth hit 
the first back-to-back home runs on the season for the Phillies in the 
second game of the series to back Moyer's 265th career victory on the 24th 
anniversary of his first major league start and win,[86] and Philadelphia 
took the rubber game, 7–1, to close out the series.[87] In the series opener 
against the Minnesota Twins, Howard had four hits in four at-bats, finishing 
a single short of the cycle and pacing the Phillies offense with two solo 
home runs, a triple, and a double as Philadelphia won, 9–5.[88] The offense 
continued in the second game, as the Phillies hit four home runs and entered 
the ninth inning leading 9–4, but Lidge blew his first save of the season 
to send the game to extra innings and the Twins won, 13–10, in the 11th 
frame.[89] The Twins took the final game and the series victory on June 
20 behind a complete game from Carl Pavano; although both pitchers finished 
the game with identical 8–6 records, it was Halladay's third consecutive 
loss.[90] Philadelphia's slate of interleague games was finished with series 
against the Cleveland Indians and the Toronto Blue Jays. Although Moyer 
allowed his major league record-tying 505th career home run (tying the 
recently deceased Roberts), it was the only run, and one of two hits, he 
gave up to Cleveland in eight innings, and Lidge saved the 2–1 victory 
for the Phillies in the opener.[91] After being tied 5–5 entering the ninth 
inning of the second game, the Indians scored in the top of the inning 
to take a 6–5 lead, but the recently reactivated Rollins hit his first 
career walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth to win the game for 
Philadelphia, 7–6.[92] The Phillies completed the series sweep with a 12–3 
victory in which Blanton pitched 7 2⁄3 innings for his third win of the 
season; Polanco had four hits in five at-bats—Utley and Werth each added 
three—while catcher Dane Sardinha hit the first home run of his major league 
career.[93] The series with the Blue Jays was originally to have been played 
in Toronto and marked Halladay's first appearance in Rogers Centre since 
leaving the Blue Jays. However, on May 12, the Blue Jays announced that 
the series would be moved to Philadelphia, citing security and logistical 
concerns for the G-20 Summit. Thus, the Blue Jays batted last as the home 
team, and the designated hitter was used.[94] Halladay faced off against 
his former club for the first time in the regular season, defeating Toronto, 
9–0; the offense was paced by three hits and four runs batted in for Ross 
Gload, along with four walks from Rollins from the leadoff spot.[95] The 
game marked the first time that the designated hitter had been used in 
a National League ballpark during the regular season; Howard was the first 
player to fill the role.[96] Hamels allowed five runs in four innings in 
the second game of the series as the Jays defeated Philadelphia, 5–1, snapping 
their four-game win streak. However, the Phillies capitalized on four Toronto 
errors in the rubber game, taking an 11–2 victory and clinching a winning 
record in interleague play for the first time since the 2007 Phillies season. 
In a return to National League play, the Phillies closed June with a series 
at Great American Ball Park. They lost to the Cincinnati Reds in the series 
opener, 7–3, as Utley sprained his right thumb sliding into second base;[97] 
the injury led the team to place him on the disabled list, along with Polanco, 
who had soreness in his elbow.[98] Philadelphia took the second game of 
the series, 9–6, in extra innings after Lidge gave up a game-tying three-run 
home run in the bottom of the ninth inning,[99] but lost the series after 
a 4–3 comeback win by Cincinnati to close the month.[100] The Phillies 
finished the month with a 13–13 record. The first game of July was also 
the first of a four-game series against the Pirates; bench coach Pete Mackanin 
led the Phillies during Manuel's one-game suspension stemming from an incident 
with umpire C. B. Bucknor, but Philadelphia lost, 3–2.[101] Their third 
consecutive loss came from seven scoreless innings by Pirates starter Ross 
Ohlendorf,[102] but they broke the streak by defeating Pittsburgh, 12–4, 
on July 3.[103] The Pirates came back to win the final game of the four-game 
set, 8–5.[104] Halladay's major-league-leading seventh complete-game victory 
opened the series with Atlanta, a 3–1 win for the Phillies;[105] however, 
Philadelphia dropped the second game in extra innings despite eight strikeouts 
in seven innings from Hamels.[106] A second consecutive loss to Atlanta—7–5 
on July 7—dropped the Phillies six games behind the division leaders,[107] 
but they defeated the Reds in extra innings the following night, 4–3, on 
a walk-off home run by Brian Schneider in the 12th inning.[108] The Phillies 
continued their winning ways in the late innings the following night, coming 
back from a six-run deficit in the ninth inning to win, 9–7, in the 10th 
inning on Howard's home run,[109] and winning the third game on Rollins' 
RBI single in the eleventh.[110] Another RBI single from Rollins provided 
the only run in the Phillies' final victory before the All-Star Break and 
capped the four-game series sweep for Philadelphia.[111] After the break, 
the Phillies opened the season's second half with consecutive losses to 
the Cubs: 12–6 on July 15, and 4–3 on July 16. In the first game, Howard 
hit two home runs, but the Cubs scored five runs in the seventh inning 
when they already owned a four-run lead.[112] Another Howard home run gave 
the Phillies the lead in the sixth inning of the July 16 contest, but the 
Cubs promptly tied the game in the bottom of the sixth inning and won it 
with a run in the bottom of the eighth.[113] The Phillies took the third 
game of the series, 4–1, in Polanco's return from injury, as he tied the 
game against Chicago closer Carlos Mármol in the ninth inning on July 17,[114] 
but Philadelphia could not secure a split in the four-game set, dropping 
the final match, 11–6, with five earned runs allowed by Halladay.[115] 
Moving to St. Louis for their next series against the Cardinals, the Phillies 
lost the opener, 8–4, as Kendrick allowed five runs in the fifth inning.[116] 
St. Louis won their seventh straight game with a 7–1 defeat of the Phillies 
on July 20,[117] and followed it with their eighth straight victory in 
a 5–1 win on July 21; it was Philadelphia's fourth straight loss.[118] 
The Phillies avoided the series sweep, however, by winning the final game 
of the series, 2–0; Polanco hit a two-run home run in the top of the 11th 
inning after Hamels one-hit the Cardinals through eight.[119] The Phillies 
returned home to face the Rockies in a four-game series; they opened with 
a five-run fifth inning to support Halladay's 11th victory of the year 
in a 6–0 win,[120] and won their third straight game by handing Colorado 
starting pitcher Ubaldo Jiménez his second loss of the season in a 10–2 
victory.[121] Two consecutive one-run games—a 4–3 contest on July 25[122] 
and a 5–4 win on July 26—sealed the Phillies' series sweep; Schneider hit 
a two-run triple in the final match to give the Phillies a lead that they 
did not relinquish, despite two consecutive games of ninth-inning struggles 
from Lidge.[123] Philadelphia continued against the National League West 
on July 27 when they opened a series against the Diamondbacks with a 9–5 
victory; Howard hit his 23rd home run, but Victorino and Rollins were both 
injured in the contest.[124] Victorino's abdominal strain put him on the 
disabled list, and top prospect Domonic Brown was promoted to take his 
place; Brown went 2-for-3 with two runs scored, two runs batted in, and 
a sacrifice fly in his major league debut the following night, a 7–1 complete-game 
victory by Halladay.[125] After acquiring starting pitcher Roy Oswalt in 
a trade from the Astros for Happ, Valdez sealed Philadelphia's eighth consecutive 
victory with an 11th-inning single to score Cody Ransom with one out on 
July 29.[126] Oswalt made his first start as a Phillies the following night, 
but the Nationals defeated the Phillies to end their winning streak; Werth 
hit a solo home run to score the Phillies' only run.[127] A second straight 
loss to Washington closed Philadelphia's month; after taking a one-run 
lead against Drew Storen in the top of the ninth inning, Ryan Zimmerman 
hit a walk-off three-run home run against Lidge in the bottom of the ninth.[128] 
The Phillies finished with a 15–13 record in the month of July. In their 
first August game, the Phillies avoided being swept by Washington with 
a 6–4 extra-inning victory; Howard was lost to a sprained ankle in the 
game, but the Phillies scored two runs against Collin Balester in the top 
of the 11th inning and Lidge earned his 11th save.[129] Howard's ankle 
injury sent him to the disabled list on August 3; John Mayberry, Jr. was 
called up in his place.[130] The next night, Halladay batted in two runs 
and struck out nine hitters over seven innings to notch a 6–1 victory in 
his first return to the location of his perfect game; Ruiz added four hits, 
and Francisco had a solo home run.[131] The second game of the series marked 
a third straight Phillies victory, as Brown backed Kendrick's two-run effort 
with three runs batted in and an outfield assist to put out Marlins first 
baseman Gaby Sánchez at home plate.[132] Philadelphia won its 60th game 
of the season in extra innings on a Ruiz home run in the top of the 10th; 
Lidge earned his 12th save as the Phillies swept the Marlins to climb to 
12 games over .500.[133] The Mets visited Citizens Bank Park for a three-game 
series starting on August 6; the Phillies defeated the Mets, 7–5, after 
scoring six runs in the eighth inning.[134] New York evened the series 
with a 1–0 victory to hand Hamels his eighth loss of the season despite 
11 strikeouts,[135] but Philadelphia took the series with a 6–5 win in 
Sunday's rubber match; Ibáñez extended his career-long hitting streak to 
16 games, while Halladay struck out ten batters in seven innings.[136] 
August 10 saw the Dodgers arriving in Philadelphia for a three-game series; 
despite Brown's first career home run and two from Gload, Kendrick allowed 
6 runs in 3 1⁄3 innings, and six pitchers from the bullpen allowed nine 
more to seal the Phillies' 50th loss of the year, 15–9.[137] The offensive 
outbursts by both teams were followed by a pitcher's duel on August 11—Chad 
Billingsley allowed two runs in six innings of work, but Oswalt scattered 
five hits and struck out five in seven shutout innings to pick up his first 
victory as a Phillie; he was followed by Madson and then Lidge, who earned 
his 15th save with a perfect ninth inning.[138] In the rubber match, the 
Dodgers scored three runs in the top of the first inning, and led 9–2 by 
the eighth inning, but Philadelphia scored four runs in the bottom of the 
eighth, and another four runs in the bottom of the ninth on only one hit, 
a walk-off RBI double by Ruiz after a hit batter and two walks by Jonathan 
Broxton and an error by Casey Blake at third base. It was Ruiz' third double 
against Broxton in three career at-bats.[139] Another series against the 
Mets at Citi Field yielded the same results as the prior one; Dickey and 
Hamels engaged in a pitcher's duel in the first game, which the Mets won, 
1–0, after the knuckleballer threw a one-hit shutout.[140] In the second 
game, Halladay turned the tables with an eight-inning shutout performance 
after the Phillies scored three unearned runs due to an error by third 
baseman David Wright, snapping a 38-inning scoreless streak at the Mets' 
home field.[141] Although the Mets filled their line-up with left-handed 
batters, who had batted .330 through August 14 against Kendrick, he defeated 
Pelfrey in the final game of the series, 3–1, to seal the Phillies' third 
consecutive series win by pitching 6 2⁄3 innings and allowing one run.[142] 
In the next series, the Giants visited Citizens Bank Park to open a ten-game 
Philadelphia homestand; former Phillie Pat Burrell hit a home run in the 
first inning against Oswalt, but the Phillies won, 9–3, behind a two-run 
single from Rollins and a two-run double from Ruiz.[143] It was Oswalt's 
first 2010 victory against the Giants; he had faced Lincecum in each of 
his first three starts against San Francisco, and he sported an 0–3 record 
with a 3.15 earned run average.[144] Rollins led the Phillies to a second 
consecutive victory the following night, going 3-for-5 and falling a double 
short of the cycle in an 8–2 victory.[145] Assured of the series win, the 
Phillies tried for a three-game sweep in their 100th consecutive sellout,[146] 
but Hamels allowed three runs in the first inning, and a total of five; 
the Phillies scored two runs on a double by Sweeney, but could not seal 
their third straight victory, losing 5–2.[147] On August 20, Philadelphia 
began a three-game series against Washington. Halladay captured his sixth 
straight victory in a 1–0 victory, lowering his ERA to 2.16 despite committing 
his first balk in over five seasons; the Phillies' only run was plated 
by Ibáñez in the third inning.[148] Stephen Strasburg made his first start 
against the Phillies in the second game, leaving early with an injury; 
Washington, however, scored eight runs to draw even in the series.[149] 
Oswalt won his third consecutive game the following day, raising his record 
in a Phillies uniform to 3–0, to take the series with a 6–0 victory.[150] 
In the opening game of the next series against Houston, Philadelphia led, 
2–1, after seven innings of play, when former Phillies outfielder Michael 
Bourn appeared to leave the basepath running from home plate to first base 
on an infield single. Though Utley, Howard, and Manuel all argued the call—leading 
to the latter's ejection[151]—the call by umpire Greg Gibson, later called 
"controversial",[152] stood and Bourn scored the winning run in the 3–2 
Philadelphia loss.[151] Umpiring played a role the following night, as 
the Phillies and Astros played to extra innings. In the 14th, Howard was 
called out on a check-swing third strike by Triple-A fill-in umpire Scott 
Barry. As Howard tossed his bat toward the dugout, Barry ejected Howard 
from the game for arguing balls and strikes. After a brief on-field altercation, 
the Phillies, who were out of bench players, moved Ibáñez to first base 
and brought on Oswalt to play left field, where he made the first putout 
of the 15th inning on a fly ball. Ibáñez made the third out on a race to 
first base with Bourn, but made an error in the 16th during a two-run Astros 
rally; the Phillies lost their longest game of the season, 4–2.[153] Happ 
defeated Halladay in his first appearance against Philadelphia since being 
traded; he allowed 2 runs through 6 1⁄3 innings to secure his fourth victory 
of the season and seal Halladay's ninth loss.[154] Houston completed the 
four-game sweep in a 5–1 contest on August 26; it was the Astros' first 
four-game sweep since they beat the Phillies in four straight games the 
previous season.[155] After taking the lead from the Padres in the eighth 
inning of the opener of the next series in San Diego, Lidge balked in the 
winning run in the bottom of the ninth, but Rollins scored the winning 
run from second base on a Polanco single in the twelfth with a slide later 
described as "fantastic", "athletic", and "unbelievable".[156] Victorino 
notched two hits and two RBI against right-handed pitcher Jon Garland in 
the series' second game, although he had batted only .220 against right-handers 
through August 26; the Phillies won, 3–1.[157] Philadelphia completed their 
three-game sweep of San Diego behind eight shutout innings from Hamels 
and a two-run home run from Sweeney, his first in a Phillies uniform.[158] 
Against the Dodgers, Hiroki Kuroda no-hit the Phillies into the eighth 
inning on August 30 before Victorino singled; the Phillies lost, 3–0.[159] 
To complete the month, the Phillies defeated Los Angeles behind Howard's 
first home run since July 27; the final tally was 8–4 in Philadelphia's 
favor,[160] finishing the month with an 18–10 record. The Phillies opened 
the season's final full month with victories on four consecutive days. 
On September 1, they defeated the Dodgers, 5–1, to complete their last 
series of the year against a National League West team; Oswalt no-hit Los 
Angeles through 5 2⁄3 innings and was supported by a career-high three 
doubles from Utley.[161] After a one-game stop in Colorado to make up the 
rainout from May 11—Philadelphia won, 12–11[162]—the Phillies returned 
home to play their final series against the National League Central, facing 
the Brewers. Hamels stretched his scoreless streak to 18 consecutive innings 
in a 1–0 victory,[163] and Philadelphia took a second straight one-run 
victory on September 4 in a 5–4 win.[164] However, they could not complete 
the sweep, as Milwaukee won the series' final game, 6–2.[165] The next 
series against Florida opened with a doubleheader, which the teams split; 
the Marlins won the day game, 7–1, behind six innings of one-hit ball from 
rookie Adalberto Méndez,[166] while the Phillies took the nightcap, 7–4.[167] 
The Phillies took the remaining games of the series as well, winning 8–7 
on September 7[168] and 10–6 the following day,[169] to move into first 
place in the National League East for the first time since May.[168] Against 
the rival Mets, Halladay batted in two runs to put the Phillies ahead in 
the series opener; in doing so, he won his 18th game of the season.[170] 
New York evened the series in a 4–3 contest on September 11,[171] but Philadelphia 
bounced back to take their fifth straight series with a 3–0 victory; Oswalt 
pitched a complete-game shutout, the eighth of his career.[172] Oswalt's 
shutout proved to be a wikt:harbringer, as it was the first victory in 
the Phillies' season-long 11-game winning streak. Their next series against 
Florida resulted in a sweep, the first of three consecutive series; Philadelphia 
defeated the Marlins, 11–4, in the series opener behind home runs from 
Werth, Utley, Ruiz, and Greg Dobbs.[173] A 2–1 victory in the second contest—in 
which Hamels struck out 13 Marlins—was Philadelphia's closest win,[174] 
which was followed by a 10–5 victory on September 16 to close out the series.[175] 
Three consecutive wins over Washington completed the next series: a 9–1 
victory on September 17, highlighted by a six-run first inning;[176] a 
5–2 win the following night in which Howard extended his streak of 30 home 
run and 100 RBI seasons to five;[177] and the sweep completed by a 7–6 
contest in which Werth hit a walk-off two-run home run.[178] The next series 
came against Atlanta, who entered three games behind Philadelphia in the 
division standings at the start of play on September 20. However, the Phillies 
swept the Braves with three consecutive victories, beginning with a 3–1 
win in which Hamels threw eight innings, calling the game "a chess match" 
and crediting his improved cut fastball and curveball.[179] The second 
game of the series, which Philadelphia won 5–3, was Halladay's 20th victory 
of the season; he became the first Phillie pitcher to reach the mark since 
Steve Carlton in 1982, and the first right-hander to do so since Roberts 
in 1955.[180] Werth scored on an Ibáñez double in the bottom of the eighth 
inning of the final contest to score the game's only run; the Phillies 
won, 1–0, after Oswalt and the Braves' Tommy Hanson pitched to a stalemate.[181] 
Philadelphia's 11th victory in a row came against the Mets on September 
24—they won, 3–2[182]—but they dropped the next two games to New York, 
5–2 and 7–3, to notch their first series loss in September.[183][184] With 
their magic number at one, Philadelphia visited Washington with Halladay 
on the mound; they clinched their fourth consecutive NL East title behind 
the pitcher's 8–0 shutout victory.[185] The Phillies became the third National 
League team in history to play in the postseason in four consecutive seasons, 
joining the Braves (1991–2005, excluding 1994) and the New York Giants 
(1921–1924).[186] In the series' second contest, the Phillies lost, 2–1, 
while resting several regulars to prepare for the National League Division 
Series.[187] They salvaged the series victory, however, with a 7–1 win 
on September 29; three backup players, including Sweeney, Francisco, and 
John Mayberry, Jr., hit home runs in the game; the Phillies finished the 
month 21–6.[188] Though some, including Chipper Jones, had speculated that 
the final series against the Braves would decide the division,[189] Atlanta 
sought a wild-card berth after the Phillies had claimed the NL East crown. 
Philadelphia won the first game of their final series against the Braves 
to "put [a] dent in Atlanta's playoff plans" behind a Rollins grand slam 
in the sixth inning.[190] The Phillies continued to play strongly with 
a third consecutive win, 7–0; after playing to a scoreless tie through 
six innings, Philadelphia scored four runs in the seventh to take the first 
lead of the contest.[191] In the season's final game, the Braves clinched 
the wild card spot to seal their postseason berth with an 8–7 victory over 
the Phillies.[192] The Phillies finished October with a 2–1 record, and 
the season at 97–65; it was the first time in franchise history that Philadelphia 
had completed a season with Major League Baseball's best record.[193] Incredibly, 
the Phillies claimed baseball's best record after a two-month stretch during 
which they were one of the worst teams. On May 21, they held the best record 
in the NL at 26-15. Over the next two months, Philadelphia fell seven games 
out of first place, languishing in third through much of the period. The 
Phillies' 22-31 record during that stretch was worse than every team except 
Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Arizona, Washington and Seattle (all teams who finished 
the season in last place). Starting from July 22, perhaps motivated by 
the firing that day of batting coach Milt Thompson, the Phillies went an 
MLB-best 49-19 through the rest of the season. All players who made an 
appearance for the Phillies during 2010 are included.[196] Infielders Coaches 
Having clinched the National League's best record, the Phillies were the 
top seed entering the playoffs; since the wild card winner cannot face 
a team from their own division in the Division Series, Philadelphia played 
the third-seeded Cincinnati Reds in the first round of the postseason. 
In the first game, Roy Halladay threw the second no-hitter of his career, 
his second of the season, and the first in National League postseason history, 
blanking the Reds, 4–0, in his first career playoff start. He became the 
second pitcher to throw a no-hitter in the postseason (Don Larsen, 1956) 
and the first pitcher to throw two no-hitters in a single season since 
Nolan Ryan in 1973.[198] In the second game, the Reds' Brandon Phillips 
had three hits, including a double and a home run against Philadelphia 
starting pitcher Roy Oswalt, but also committed two of Cincinnati's four 
errors. The errors allowed the Phillies to score five unearned runs to 
take a 7–4 victory over the Reds and a 2–0 lead in the series.[199][200] 
Displaying the form he showed in 2008 when he won the League Championship 
Series and World Series Most Valuable Player Awards, Cole Hamels pitched 
a complete-game shutout in the third game of the series to clinch the Phillies' 
spot in the National League Championship Series. Philadelphia's pitchers 
set a Division Series record, allowing only 11 hits in 3 games, better 
than the 1998 New York Yankees' 13 allowed to the Texas Rangers.[201] Having 
collected a 22–10 record against the National League West during the season, 
the Phillies faced off against that division's champions, the San Francisco 
Giants—with whom they split the season series, 3–3[194]—in the National 
League Championship Series. Game 1 "had been hyped incessantly because 
of the matchup between Halladay and Giants ace Tim Lincecum",[202] and 
the game ended as a 4–3 victory for the Giants. All of the game's offense 
was generated via the home run, with San Francisco's Cody Ross hitting 
two solo home runs against Halladay.[202] The second game matched Oswalt 
against Jonathan Sánchez; Philadelphia's starting pitcher allowed one run 
through eight innings and scored a run sliding in the seventh after running 
through third base coach Sam Perlozzo's "stop" sign. The final score was 
6–1, with San Francisco's only run coming on Ross' third solo home run 
of the series.[203] In Game 3, Philadelphia was shut out in the postseason 
for the sixth time in franchise history; Ross batted in another run to 
score Edgar Rentería as the Giants defeated the Phillies, 3–0. The Phillies 
went 0-for-5 with baserunners in scoring position.[204] The following night, 
manager Charlie Manuel started Joe Blanton, as planned—instead of Halladay, 
who would have pitched on short rest—and the Phillies dropped their second 
consecutive contest. Philadelphia took a 4–2 lead in the fifth inning when 
Victorino singled to center field to score Ben Francisco, but San Francisco 
came back to take a 5–4 lead in the sixth. After the Phillies tied the 
game, Oswalt pitched the bottom of the ninth inning in relief and gave 
up a walk-off sacrifice fly to Juan Uribe.[205] With one loss standing 
between the Phillies and elimination, Halladay took the mound for Game 
5. Although he pulled a groin muscle during the second inning, he completed 
six innings of work and Philadelphia defeated the Giants, 4–2. The pitcher 
also sacrificed baserunners to second and third bases with no one out in 
the third with a bunt "that rolled over home plate", setting up the Phillies' 
first runs of the game.[206] Roy Halladay won the Baseball America Major 
League Player of the Year, the Best Major League Baseball Player ESPY Award 
(2011; presented in June 2011, for his performance since June 2010), the 
"This Year in Baseball Awards" Starting Pitcher of the Year,[207] the NL 
Cy Young Award, the Players Choice Awards NL Outstanding Pitcher, the Baseball 
Prospectus Internet Baseball Awards NL Cy Young, the NLBM Wilbur "Bullet" 
Rogan Legacy Award (NL Pitcher of the Year), the Sporting News NL Pitcher 
of the Year Award, and the USA Today NL Cy Young. He also received the 
MLB Clutch Performer of the Year Award,[208] the Heart & Hustle Award, 
and the "This Year in Baseball Awards" Postseason Moment of the Year.[209] 
He was also named the Sporting News Pro Athlete of the Year, the Daily 
News Sportsperson of the Year, and the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association 
Pro Athlete of the Year[210][211][212] In summer 2011, he received the 
John Wanamaker Athletic Award from the Philadelphia Sports Congress, based 
on his performance during the 2010 calendar year.[213][213][214][215][216][217][218][219] 
Shane Victorino won his third consecutive NL Rawlings Gold Glove Award. 
Chase Utley won the Fielding Bible Award at second base. Carlos Ruiz was 
named the "This Year in Baseball Awards" X-Factor Player of the Year[220] 
and received the Pride of Philadelphia Award. Victorino also received the 
Philadelphia Sports Writers Association Humanitarian Award. Brad Lidge 
won the Frank Slocum Big B.A.T. Award for "an individual or a group of 
individuals whose exemplary service to the [MLB Baseball Assistance Team 
(B.A.T.)] organization has helped provide dignity and self-esteem to members 
of the Baseball Family." The Philadelphia chapter of the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America (BBWAA) presented its annual franchise awards to 
Ryan Howard ("Mike Schmidt Most Valuable Player Award"), Roy Halladay ("Steve 
Carlton Most Valuable Pitcher Award"), Roy Halladay ("Dallas Green Special 
Achievement Award"), and Shane Victorino ("Tug McGraw Good Guy Award"). 
Charlie Manuel won the Chuck Tanner Major League Baseball Manager of the
