Nestor George Chylak, Jr. (/ˈtʃaɪlæk/; May 11, 1922 – February 17, 1982) 
was an American umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the American 
League from 1954 to 1978. He umpired in three ALCS (1969, 1972, 1973), 
serving as crew chief in 1969 and 1973. He also called five World Series 
(1957, 1960, 1966, 1971, 1977), serving as the crew chief in 1971 (in which 
he called balls and strikes in the decisive Game 7) and 1977. He also worked 
in six All-Star Games: 1957, 1960 (both games), 1964, 1973 and 1978, calling 
balls and strikes in the second 1960 game and in 1973. Chylak was born 
in Olyphant, Pennsylvania. His parents, Nestor Sr. and Nellie, were of 
Ukrainian descent; Chylak was the first of their five children.[1] He attended 
the University of Scranton, where he studied engineering.[2] During World 
War II, he served in the U.S. Army in Europe. He suffered shrapnel injuries 
in Battle of the Bulge, which blinded him for several days and hospitalized 
him for eight weeks.[3] He earned both the Silver Star and Purple Heart 
during his service. After the war, he began umpiring amateur baseball in 
1946, and returned briefly to college.[1] After a year in amateur baseball, 
Chylak moved into the minor leagues as a Pennsylvania – Ontario – New York 
League umpire. He spent several more minor league seasons in the Canadian–American 
League, the New England League and the Eastern League. He debuted in the 
major leagues in 1954.[1] Chylak said that two of his greatest thrills 
occurred in the early to mid-1960s. In the 1960 World Series, he was umpiring 
when Bill Mazeroski of the Pittsburgh Pirates hit the home run that allowed 
the Pirates to defeat the New York Yankees. He worked Sandy Koufax's final 
game in the 1966 World Series in which Koufax and the Dodgers faced the 
Baltimore Orioles and Jim Palmer.[4] Chylak worked the first American League 
Championship Series in 1969. On June 4, 1974, he was on the field in Cleveland 
for "Ten Cent Beer Night".[5] The Cleveland Indians had been struggling 
with low attendance figures, resulting in this promotion that attracted 
more than 25,000 fans to the game. Fans became unruly and incited fights 
with the players, sometimes pouring beer on them. Chylak declared the game 
a forfeit after he sustained a facial wound from being hit with a chair.[1] 
He umpired the first major league game played in Toronto in 1977, during 
a snowstorm at Exhibition Stadium, for which he was the home plate umpire. 
After retiring from the field in 1978, he became an assistant league supervisor 
of umpires. Chylak was in the umpire's dressing room at Comiskey Park on 
Disco Demolition Night, a July 12, 1979, doubleheader between the Detroit 
Tigers and Chicago White Sox. Between games of the doubleheader, when unruly 
fans began to riot and blow up disco records on the field, Chylak told 
White Sox owner Bill Veeck that under no circumstances would the second 
game of the doubleheader be played. Veeck protested furiously, but Chylak's 
decision was upheld by American League president Lee MacPhail. The next 
day, MacPhail ordered the second game of the twinbill be forfeited to Detroit. 
Following his retirement, he became a member of the Sports Illustrated 
Speakers' Bureau and addressed a wide variety of groups, "talking about 
the intangible lessons he learned during his years in baseball".[6] Chylak 
died of a heart attack at age 59 in Dunmore, Pennsylvania, and is survived 
by his wife Sue, his sons Robert and William, and seven grandchildren. 
Upon his death, Bowie Kuhn said that "few have ever been more respected 
in his field than Mr. Chylak."[4] AL president Lee MacPhail said, "He was 
considered an outstanding teacher and certainly one of the finest umpires 
in major league baseball in modern times. We are sure he will be a candidate 
for eventual Hall of Fame recognition... Baseball has lost a wonderful 
friend and a great umpire."[4] He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame
