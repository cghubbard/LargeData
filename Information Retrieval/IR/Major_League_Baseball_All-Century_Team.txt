In 1999, the Major League Baseball All-Century Team was chosen by popular 
vote of fans. To select the team, a panel of experts first compiled a list 
of the 100 greatest Major League Baseball players from the past century. 
Over two million fans then voted on the players using paper and online 
ballots.[1] The top two vote-getters from each position, except outfielders 
(nine), and the top six pitchers were placed on the team. A select panel 
then added five legends to create a thirty-man team:[1]â€”Warren Spahn (who 
finished #10 among pitchers), Christy Mathewson (#14 among pitchers), Lefty 
Grove (#18 among pitchers), Honus Wagner (#4 among shortstops), and Stan 
Musial (#11 among outfielders).[1] The nominees for the All-Century team 
were presented at the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Preceding Game 
2 of the 1999 World Series, the members of the All-Century Team were revealed. 
Every living player named to the team attended. For the complete list of 
the 100 players nominated, see The MLB All-Century Team. There was controversy 
over the inclusion in the All-Century Team of Pete Rose, who had been banned 
from baseball for life 10 years earlier. Some questioned Rose's presence 
on a team officially endorsed by Major League Baseball, but fans at the 
stadium gave him a standing ovation. During the on-field ceremony, which 
was emceed by Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully, NBC Sports' Jim Gray 
questioned Rose about his refusal to admit to gambling on baseball.[2] 
Gray's interview became controversial, with some arguing that it was good 
journalism,[3] while others objected that the occasion was an inappropriate 
setting for Gray's persistence.[4] After initially refusing to do so, Gray 
apologized a few days later.[5] On January 8, 2004, more than four years 
later, Rose admitted publicly to betting on baseball games in his autobiography
