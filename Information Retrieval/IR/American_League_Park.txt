American League Park, known by historians as American League Park I, was 
a baseball park that formerly stood in Washington, D.C., at the corner 
of Florida Avenue and Trinidad Avenue, NE. It hosted the Washington Senators 
from the 1901 season through the 1903 season. Boundary Field, in Northwest 
DC, had been the preferred site for the American League Senators, but its 
usage had been blocked by the National League, which still had rights to 
the site despite no longer having a franchise in Washington. Once peace 
was reached between the leagues, the Senators moved to that site for the 
1904 season, which became known as American League Park II or National 
Park. The stands from American League Park I were transported to the new 
location along with the team.[1] By 1907, there was no longer a baseball 
field on the site.[2] American League Park was also the formal name of 
the ballpark in New York City that was popularly known as Hilltop Park.
