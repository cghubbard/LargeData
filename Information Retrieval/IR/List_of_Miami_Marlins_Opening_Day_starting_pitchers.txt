The Miami Marlins are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in 
Miami, Florida. They play in the National League East division. The first 
game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and 
being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to 
the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season,[1] though 
there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not 
start on Opening Day.[2] The Marlins have used 14 different Opening Day 
starting pitchers in their 24 seasons. Since the Marlins' first season 
in 1993, the 14 starters have a combined Opening Day record of ten wins 
and ten losses (10–10).[3][4][5] Seven Marlins pitchers have started on 
two or more Opening Days.[3] Those seven are Charlie Hough, Kevin Brown, 
Alex Fernandez, Ryan Dempster, Josh Beckett, Dontrelle Willis, and Josh 
Johnson.[3] Beckett holds the record for most Opening Day starts as a Marlin, 
with three appearances, from 2003 to 2005.[3] When playing at their home 
field of Land Shark Stadium, the Marlins have a record of seven wins and 
five losses (7–5).[3] In the franchise's history, Florida has only played 
Opening Day games at another team's home stadium six times.[3] As the away 
team, Marlins' starting pitchers have an Opening Day record of one win 
and four losses (1–3).[3] The longest ever Opening Day winning streak for 
Marlins starting pitchers is two years, when Florida won in 2004 and 2005 
under starting pitcher Josh Beckett.[3] The Marlins longest Opening Day 
losing streak for starting pitchers was the three losses that came in 1994, 
1995, and 1996, under starting pitchers Charlie Hough (1994), John Burkett 
(1995), and Kevin Brown (1996).[3] The Marlins have won the World Series 
twice, in 1997 and 2003, and in those seasons, their starting pitchers
