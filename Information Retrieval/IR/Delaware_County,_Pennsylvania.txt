Delaware County, colloquially referred to as Delco,[2] is a county located 
in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. With a 2010 census population of 558,979,[3] 
it is the fifth most populous county in Pennsylvania, and the third smallest 
in area. The county was created on September 26, 1789, from part of Chester 
County and named for the Delaware River. Its county seat is Media.[4] Until 
1850, Chester City was the county seat of both Delaware County and, before 
that, of Chester County. Delaware County is adjacent to the city-county 
of Philadelphia and is included in the Philadelphia–Camden–Wilmington, 
PA–NJ–DE–MD Metropolitan Statistical Area. Delaware County is the only 
county covered in its entirety by area codes 610 and 484. Delaware County 
lies in the river and bay drainage area named "Delaware" in honor of Thomas 
West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, Governor of the nearby English colony of Virginia. 
The land was "discovered" and explored by Henry Hudson in 1609, and over 
the next several decades it was variously claimed and settled by the Swedes, 
the Dutch, and the English. Its original human inhabitants were the Lenni-Lenape 
tribe of American Indians. Once the Dutch were defeated and the extent 
of New York was determined, King Charles II of England made his grant to 
William Penn in order to found the colony which came to be named Pennsylvania. 
Penn divided his colony into three counties: Bucks, Philadelphia, and Chester. 
The riverfront land south of Philadelphia, being the most accessible, was 
quickly granted and settled. In 1789, the southeastern portion of Chester 
County was divided from the rest and named Delaware County for the Delaware 
River. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area 
of 191 square miles (490 km2), of which 184 square miles (480 km2) is land 
and 6.8 square miles (18 km2) (3.5%) is water.[5] It is the third-smallest 
county in Pennsylvania by area. Delaware County is roughly diamond- or 
kite-shaped, with the four sides formed by the Chester County boundary 
to the northwest, the boundary with the state of Delaware (a portion of 
the "Twelve Mile Circle") to the southwest, the Delaware River (forming 
the border with the state of New Jersey to the southeast, and the city 
of Philadelphia and Montgomery County to the east and northeast. The lowest 
point in the state of Pennsylvania is located on the Delaware River in 
Marcus Hook in Delaware County, where it flows out of Pennsylvania and 
into Delaware. The highest point in Delaware County is 500 feet at two 
points southeast of Wyola in Newtown Township [1]. Waterways in Delaware 
County generally flow in a southward direction and ultimately drain into 
the Delaware River. The waterways are, from west to east: the Brandywine 
River (forming a portion of the county's western boundary with Chester 
County), Chester Creek, Ridley Creek, Crum Creek, Muckinipates Creek, Darby 
Creek and Cobbs Creek (forming a portion of the county's eastern boundary 
with Philadelphia). Crum Creek was dammed in 1931 near Pennsylvania Route 
252 to fill Springton Lake (also known as Geist Reservoir), an approximately 
391-acre (1.58 km2)[6] drinking water reservoir maintained by Aqua America, 
the county's largest lake. Delaware County is one of four counties in the 
United States to border a state with which it shares the same name (the 
other three are Nevada County, California, Texas County, Oklahoma, and 
Ohio County, West Virginia). 2,600 acres (11 km2) of the county are occupied 
by the Ridley Creek State Park. As of the 2010 census, the county was 71.1%

housing units at an average density of 1,178 per square mile (455/km²).

2008, there are 406,352 registered voters in Delaware County.[10] Politically, 
Delaware County traditionally voted Republican. It voted for the Republican 
candidate in nearly every election from 1854 through 1988, with exceptions 
including the 1964 presidential election. As was the case in most of the 
Philadelphia suburbs, however, the brand of Republicanism that prevailed 
in the area was traditionally a moderate one. It has operated under a home-rule 
charter with five at-large councilmembers since 1972. Republicans remain 
in control of many county council seats and row offices. In recent elections, 
however, Delaware County has been trending Democratic and the Republican 
registration edge has declined rapidly from over twice as many voters as 
Democrats had in 2002. It narrowly voted for Bill Clinton in 1992, but 
has gone Democratic in every Presidential election since then by 10 points 
or more by progressively-increasing margins. In the 2004 election Democratic 
presidential candidate John Kerry won the county by 14 points. In the 2004 
US Senate election, Republican Arlen Specter defeated Joe Hoeffel but Democrat 
Bob Casey, Jr. defeated Rick Santorum in the 2006 Senate election. In the 
2008 presidential election, Democratic Senator Barack Obama defeated Republican 
Senator John McCain resoundingly, by over 21 points. All three Democratic 
state row office candidates also carried it in 2008. Most of Delaware County 
is located in the state's 7th congressional district, represented by Republican 
Pat Meehan. The district had been held for 20 years by Republican Curt 
Weldon until he was ousted by Joe Sestak, a retired admiral, in the 2006 
U.S. House of Representatives election. Also in the 2006 election, Democrat 
Bryan Lentz unseated Republican incumbent State Representative Tom Gannon 
in the 161st House district. In 2010 Sestak ran for the senate seat vacated 
by Arlen Specter and was replaced by Meehan, defeating Lentz, who ran as 
the Democrat. Lentz was replaced in the State House by Joe Hackett, a Republican. 
A small portion of the county, mostly consisting of the areas around Chester, 
Yeadon and Darby, is in the Philadelphia-based 1st district, represented 
by Democrat Bob Brady. [11] [12] The George W. Hill Correctional Facility

pupil funding from the state along with federal funding. They are eligible 
to apply for many competitive grants offered by the state and federal governments.

borders of the Chester Upland School District. Charter schools may accept 
students from neighboring school districts. From EDNA, Educational Entity
