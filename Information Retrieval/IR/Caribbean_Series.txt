The Caribbean Series (Spanish: Serie del Caribe), also called Caribbean 
World Series, is the highest baseball tournament at club level in Latin 
America, featuring the champions of Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto 
Rico, and Venezuela. The tournament location is rotated annually among 
the countries and is normally played in February after all of the leagues 
have ended their national tournaments. The 2014 Caribbean Series was held

agreed to stage a four-country, round-robin tournament 12-game to be known 
as the Serie del Caribe, to be launched in Cuba from February 20–25 of 
1949. The Series ran annually from 1949 through 1960, with Cuba winning 
seven times. However, the event was cancelled after Fidel Castro dissolved 
all professional baseball in Cuba in 1961. It was not until 1970 when the 
Caribbean Series was revived. Moreover, the 1982 Caribbean Series was not
