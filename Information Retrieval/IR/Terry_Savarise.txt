Terry Savarise is the senior vice president of stadium operations for the 
Chicago White Sox major league baseball team.[1] He is the executive responsible 
for all aspects of the operation of U.S. Cellular Field, including the 
over 2,000 employees who staff the ballpark on game days. Savarise directed 
the planning and construction of the ballpark, which opened in 1991. A 
phased, multi-year series of major renovations to the facility is currently 
underway. Under Savarise’s leadership seating has been moved closer to 
the field of play, a popular "Fan Deck" was added in center field, and 
the entire color scheme of the ballpark was changed from whites and blues 
to dark greys and greens. In a dramatic move that shocked and delighted 
fans, the team also removed the top eight rows of the ballpark’s upper 
deck and added a new roof over this portion of the stadium. Together, these 
changes had an enormous impact on fan perceptions of the facility; previously 
the ballpark was maligned for its blandness, steep upper deck and lack 
of intimacy. Today, it is considered one of the finest sports facilities 
in North America. Savarise also serves as senior vice president of operations 
for the United Center, home of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago Blackhawks. 
Savarise was responsible for all design and construction aspects of this 
multipurpose arena. He also coordinated the installation and operation 
of the 1996 Democratic National Convention at the United Center. Savarise 
spearheaded the design and construction of Tucson Electric Park, the White 
Sox spring training facility and stadium in Tucson, Arizona, which opened 
in the spring of 1998. He worked closely on the design and construction 
of Ed Smith Stadium in Sarasota, Florida, which served as the club’s spring 
training and minor league headquarters from 1989-97. In addition, he assisted 
in the development of L.P. Frans Stadium, home of the White Sox former
