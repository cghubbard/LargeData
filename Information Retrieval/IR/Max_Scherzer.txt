Maxwell M. "Max" Scherzer (born July 27, 1984) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Scherzer has also played in MLB for the Arizona Diamondbacks and 
Detroit Tigers. In 2013, he won the American League Cy Young Award. In 
2015, Scherzer became just the sixth pitcher in Major League history to 
throw two no-hitters in a single season.[1] On May 11, 2016, Scherzer tied 
the major league nine-inning strikeout record with 20, against his former 
team, the Detroit Tigers. Scherzer was born and raised in Chesterfield, 
Missouri, the son of Jan (Shirck) and Brad Scherzer.[2] After playing for 
Parkway Central High School in his hometown, Scherzer was drafted by the 
St. Louis Cardinals in the 43rd round (1,291st overall) in the 2003 Major 
League Baseball Draft but did not sign and instead attended the University 
of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. He was then drafted again in 2006 by 
the Arizona Diamondbacks, this time in the 1st round as the 11th overall 
pick. He was Mizzou's first-ever 1st round MLB pick.[3] On January 9, 2012 
it was announced that Scherzer would be one of six new inductees to the 
University of Missouri Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame. While at 
Mizzou, he won Big 12 Pitcher of the Year in 2005. Following his freshman 
year at the University of Missouri, Scherzer made his debut with the La 
Crosse Loggers of the Northwoods League (NWL), a collegiate summer baseball 
league. He went 2-1 that summer with a 1.91 ERA with 6 saves. He also struck 
out 50 hitters in only 33 innings pitched. He was named a mid-season All-Star.[citation 
needed] Scherzer was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks with the 11th 
overall pick of the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft. However, he and his 
agent, Scott Boras, failed to reach an agreement with the club. Scherzer 
thus began his professional career with the Fort Worth Cats of the independent 
American Association. After appearing in three games, Scherzer signed a 
$4.3 million contract with the Diamondbacks.[4] He began playing in the 
Diamondbacks organization in 2007 with the Single-A Visalia Oaks. He was 
promoted to Double-A Mobile BayBears after three impressive starts for 
the Oaks. During the 2008 offseason, he was named the fourth-best prospect 
in the Diamondbacks organization.[5] After a good start to the 2008 season 
in Triple-A Tucson he was called up to the Diamondbacks on April 27, 2008. 
On April 29, 2008, Scherzer made his MLB debut against the Houston Astros 
when he came on in relief and threw 4 1⁄3 perfect innings while striking 
out seven. While doing so he also set the record for the number of consecutive 
batters retired (13) for a pitcher making his MLB debut as a reliever. 
The previous record was 12 set in 1962 by the Dodgers Pete Richert. The 
seven strikeouts were one short of the major-league record for most in 
a debut relief appearance. The Pirates Barry Jones had eight on April 20, 
1986. On April 30, 2008, the Diamondbacks announced[6] he would be placed 
into the starting rotation, due to his impressive debut. In his first appearance 
as a starter for the D-Backs, Scherzer allowed five runs (two earned) in 
four innings, while striking out five, taking the first loss of his major 
league career. He returned to the bullpen for much of the 2008 season. 
He started against the Cardinals, his home town team growing up, on September 
24 and lost for the fourth time in his career in a winless season, going 
five innings, allowing seven hits and four runs (two earned) while walking 
two and striking out four.[7] Scherzer participated in the 2008 Arizona 
Fall League season as member of the Phoenix Desert Dogs. Scherzer became 
a full-time starter in 2009, filling the fifth starter role in the D-Backs 
rotation. He recorded his first major league victory in a 12–0 win over 
the Atlanta Braves on May 16, 2009. On May 26, Scherzer recorded his second 
win of his career. He finished the 2009 season with 30 starts, a 9–11 record, 
4.12 ERA, and 174 strikeouts in 170⅓ innings pitched. After the 2009 season, 
Scherzer worked out in Fort Collins, Colorado with the Colorado State University 
baseball team. On December 9, 2009, Scherzer was traded along with Daniel 
Schlereth, Phil Coke, and Austin Jackson to the Detroit Tigers as part 
of a three team trade that brought Ian Kennedy and Edwin Jackson to the 
Diamondbacks and Curtis Granderson to the New York Yankees.[8] Detroit 
optioned Scherzer to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens on May 16, 2010, replacing 
him with Armando Galarraga.[9] Shortly thereafter he returned successfully 
to the major leagues, going 6–4 in twelve starts with an ERA of 2.62 and 
85 strikeouts in 75 2⁄3 innings. On May 30 against the Oakland Athletics, 
Scherzer accumulated 14 strikeouts in only 5 2⁄3 innings pitched. This 
was the fourth time in his career to date that he had 10 or more strikeouts 
in a single game. He allowed two hits, four walks, and hit a batter on 
his last pitch before being replaced. That mark was tied for the most strikeouts 
in Comerica Park history with Jeremy Bonderman, and tied for second in 
franchise history behind Mickey Lolich, who had 16 strikeouts in one game. 
On July 26, Scherzer and Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Matt Garza took a no-hit 
duel into the sixth inning. Scherzer lost the no-hit and shutout bids after 
giving up a grand slam to Matt Joyce, while Garza went on to throw the 
no-hitter. On September 1 against the Minnesota Twins, Scherzer pitched 
into the 9th inning for the first time in his career. He gave up one run 
on four hits and one walk while striking out nine on 107 pitches, though 
he got a no-decision as the Tigers lost the game in the 10th inning. Scherzer 
finished the 2010 season with a 12–11 record, 3.50 ERA and 184 strikeouts. 
Despite spending some time in the minor leagues, his strikeout total was 
still good for 10th in the American League. In the 2011 season, Scherzer 
was the third starter in the rotation, and won six straight starts early 
in the year, being the first Tiger since Jeremy Bonderman in 2006 to accomplish 
this feat. He finished the season with a 15-9 record, and was 3rd in the 
AL in home runs allowed (29), 4th in wild pitches, 5th in hit by pitch 
(10), 9th in win–loss percentage (.625), and 10th in wins.[10] On May 20, 
2012, Scherzer struck out 15 Pittsburgh Pirates in seven innings, falling 
one strikeout short of tying the franchise record set by Mickey Lolich.[11] 
His career-high 231 total strikeouts during the 2012 regular season placed 
second in the American League, behind teammate Justin Verlander's 239.[12] 
His strikeout rate of 11.1 per 9 innings led the American League. He also 
finished the regular season with career highs in wins (16) and winning 
percentage (16–7, .696). Despite battling a late-season injury, Scherzer 
pitched successfully for the Tigers in the 2012 post-season. He made three 
starts, going 1–0 with a 2.08 ERA, while striking out 26 batters in 17 
1⁄3 innings. He pitched Game 4 of the 2012 World Series against the San 
Francisco Giants, the first World Series appearance of his career. He gave 
up three earned runs in 6 1⁄3 innings while striking out eight batters, 
getting a no-decision as the Tigers lost the game in extra innings. After 
a win against the Tampa Bay Rays on June 28, Scherzer became the first 
Tigers pitcher to ever start a season 12–0, surpassing the 11–0 start from 
George Mullin in 1909.[13] With a win against the Toronto Blue Jays on 
July 3, Scherzer also became the first major league starter to begin a 
season 13–0 since Roger Clemens in 1986.[14][15] The streak ended with 
a loss to the Texas Rangers on July 13.[16] On July 1, Scherzer was selected 
by player vote to represent the American League in the 2013 All-Star Game. 
It was his first All-Star selection. On July 15, Scherzer was selected 
to start the game by his manager, Jim Leyland, who managed the AL All-Star 
team this season.[17] Scherzer pitched a perfect 1-2-3 inning in the game, 
striking out Joey Votto for one of the three outs. Entering the All-Star 
break, Scherzer had a 13–1 record, 3.19 ERA, 0.98 WHIP and 152 strikeouts 
in 129 2⁄3 innings pitched. On August 8, Scherzer recorded his 1,000th 
career strikeout when he fanned Jason Kipnis of the Cleveland Indians.[18] 
With a win over the New York Mets on August 24, Scherzer became the third 
pitcher in major league history to start a season 19–1, following Roger 
Clemens in 2001 and Rube Marquard in 1912.[19] On September 20, after a 
12–5 win over the Chicago White Sox, Scherzer became the first major league 
pitcher to reach 20 wins. Scherzer became the second Tigers pitcher to 
reach 20 wins since Bill Gullickson in 1991, following Justin Verlander 
in 2011, and the 45th in Tigers history.[20] He finished the regular season 
at 21–3, with a league-leading 0.97 WHIP, 2.90 ERA, and a career-high 240 
strikeouts. He was the only 20-game winner in the majors in 2013. Scherzer's 
stellar season earned him the 2013 AL Cy Young Award, receiving 28 of 30 
first-place votes.[21] Scherzer had a dominant performance in Game 1 of 
the 2013 ALDS, recording 11 strikeouts and giving up just one hit through 
the first six innings, before surrendering a 2-run homer to Yoenis Céspedes. 
He finished with 7 innings pitched, giving up three hits, as he and the 
Tigers won the game, 3–2 over the Oakland Athletics.[22] He struck out 
Josh Donaldson, Brandon Moss, and Josh Reddick twice.[23] Scherzer was 
in line to make a Game 5 start in the same series, but facing elimination 
in Game 4, manager Jim Leyland chose to bring him in as a reliever in the 
seventh inning. Scherzer gave up the go-ahead run in the top of the inning, 
but the Tigers retook the lead in the bottom of the frame. Scherzer then 
loaded the bases with no outs in the top of the eighth, but wriggled out 
of trouble by striking out Josh Reddick and Stephen Vogt, then getting 
Alberto Callaspo to line out to center field. The Tigers won the game, 
and Scherzer earned the victory to go to 2–0 in the series.[24] Scherzer 
continued his brilliance into the 2013 ALCS against the eventual World 
Series champions Boston Red Sox. In Game 2 of the series, he no-hit Boston 
for 5 2⁄3 innings, eventually surrendering two hits and a run in the bottom 
of the sixth. He left the game with a 5–1 lead after seven innings, striking 
out 13. But a quartet of Tiger relievers blew the lead in the eighth inning, 
and Boston won it, 6–5, on a walk-off single in the ninth.[25] Scherzer 
was the losing pitcher in the Tigers 5–2 loss to the Red Sox in Game 6, 
the deciding game of that series. On January 17, 2014, Scherzer and the 
Tigers agreed on a $15.525 million salary for the 2014 season, avoiding 
arbitration for the third straight year.[26] On May 5, Scherzer struck 
out nine Houston Astros batters in eight innings of a 2–0 victory. This 
was his seventh straight game from the start of the season with at least 
seven strikeouts, establishing a Detroit Tigers franchise record. The streak 
ended May 10 against the Minnesota Twins, when he struck out 6 batters 
in 6 innings.[27] The Major League record for consecutive 7+ strikeout 
games to start the season is nine, accomplished by Bob Feller in 1946.[28] 
On June 12, in his 179th career start, Scherzer pitched his first career 
complete game shutout in a three-hit 4–0 win over the Chicago White Sox. 
He struck out eight batters in the contest and threw 113 pitches. This 
was the longest stretch any major league starter had gone without a complete 
game since 1900.[29] On July 6, Scherzer was named to his second AL All-Star 
team by way of John Farrell's manager selection.[30] He pitched a scoreless 
fifth inning in the game, giving up one hit, striking out two, and earning 
the win for the AL.[31] Scherzer finished the 2014 season with an 18–5 
record, 3.19 ERA and 1.175 WHIP. He pitched a career-high 220 1⁄3 innings 
and struck out a career-high 252 batters.[32] His 18 wins tied for the 
AL lead, along with Corey Kluber and Jered Weaver.[33] Max made his only 
postseason appearance of 2014 in Game 1 of the American League Division 
Series against the Baltimore Orioles. He was tagged with the loss after 
surrendering five runs (all earned) in 7 1⁄3 innings.[34] On January 21, 
2015, Scherzer was signed by the Washington Nationals to a seven-year, 
$210 million contract. The contract included a $50 million signing bonus 
that would be paid out over 14 years, the largest contract deferral in 
MLB history.[35][36] On January 22, it was reported that Scherzer's contract 
calls for his salary to be $10 million in 2015, and $15 million in each 
of the next three seasons. It then increases to $35 million a year in 2019, 
2020 and 2021, the seasons in which his deferrals begin. In addition, his 
contract also includes several award bonuses. He would receive $250,000 
for winning a Cy Young, MVP or World Series MVP award, $150,000 if he's 
the MVP of the League Championship Series and $100,000 if he makes the 
All-Star team, wins a Gold Glove or wins a Silver Slugger award. The contract 
does not contain a no-trade clause.[37][38] Scherzer made his first start 
for the Nationals during opening day against the New York Mets on April 
6, 2015, where he struck out 8 batters in 7 2⁄3 innings as the Nationals 
lost to the Mets 3–1.[39] On June 14, 2015, he pitched his second career 
complete game, giving up one hit and one walk in a 4–0 shutout against 
the Milwaukee Brewers. Scherzer's 16 strikeouts were a career high and 
also set a Nationals team record for most strikeouts in a game.[40] Six 
days later, he no-hit the Pittsburgh Pirates 6–0 at Nationals Park. After 
retiring the first 26 batters, he came to within one strike of a perfect 
game, only to hit the 27th batter, José Tábata. Scherzer secured the no-hitter 
by retiring Josh Harrison on a fly ball one batter later. This was the 
13th time the 27th and presumably last batter disrupted a perfect game.[41][42] 
Scherzer's ERA during the month of June was 1.79.[43] Scherzer achieved 
a game score of 97 or more twice in the 2015 season, a feat only accomplished 
two other times, by Nolan Ryan in 1990 and Pedro Martinez in 2000.[44] 
Scherzer threw his second career no-hitter, and second of the season, against 
the New York Mets on October 3, striking out a career high 17 batters with 
no walks, the only base runner coming from a throwing error by Yunel Escobar.[1] 
Several baseball analysts and pundits described Scherzer's second no-hitter 
as one of the greatest pitching performances of all time, and perhaps the 
most dominant no-hitter ever pitched, based on his number of strikeouts, 
lack of walks issued or batters hit by pitch, and dominance of the opposing 
roster on the third time through the lineup; at one point, Scherzer had 
struck out 9 straight Mets, just one shy of the Major League record set 
by Tom Seaver in 1970.[45][46][47] On May 11, 2016, Scherzer tied the record 
held by Roger Clemens (twice), Randy Johnson, and Kerry Wood for strikeouts 
over nine innings, becoming the first pitcher to strike out 20 batters 
in a regulation game in the 21st century. He earned the win against his 
former team, the Detroit Tigers, in a matchup with former Nationals teammate 
Jordan Zimmermann.[48][49] In addition, Scherzer joined Johnson as the 
only other player with a career 20 strikeout game and a no hitter. Scherzer 
also became the 17th pitcher all time to record a win against all 30 MLB 
teams in his career.[50] On July 8, 2016 Scherzer was named as the National 
League All-Star Game roster replacement for Washington Nationals pitcher 
Stephen Strasburg due to Strasburg just recently coming off of the DL. 
Max Scherzer will play for Team USA in the 2017 World Baseball Classic.[51] 
With a low three-quarters delivery (nearly sidearm) Scherzer throws four 
pitches: a four-seam fastball with good movement averaging 92–96 mph (topping 
out at 99 mph[52]), a slider at 85–86 mph, a changeup at 84–85 mph, and 
an occasional curveball at 78–79 mph. The slider is his primary off-speed 
pitch to right-handed hitters, and the changeup is primarily used against 
left-handed hitters. Scherzer throws the curveball sparingly, about four 
times a game.[53] He said in early 2016 he is working on adding a cutter 
to his arsenal.[54] Scherzer's younger and only brother, Alex, committed 
suicide early in the summer of 2012. Alex had a passion for analyzing advanced 
baseball statistics or sabermetrics. Scherzer learned the value of sabermetrics 
from his brother, and he implements this as a tool to improve his game. 
Since Alex's death, Scherzer dedicates every start to his late brother.[55][56] 
Scherzer has heterochromia iridum, which means that one iris is a different 
color from the other; his right eye is blue and his left eye is brown.[57][58] 
On June 12, 2011, the Detroit Tigers distributed a bobblehead doll depicting
