As Player As Manager John James Onslow (October 13, 1888 – December 22, 
1960) was an American player, manager, coach and scout in Major League 
Baseball. At age 60, Onslow became one of the oldest rookie managers in 
MLB annals when he was named skipper of the Chicago White Sox in the fall 
of 1948, succeeding Hall of Fame pitcher Ted Lyons. Onslow managed the 
South Siders for the entire 1949 season, finishing sixth in the American 
League with a 63–91 record. But he could not get along with his boss, Chisox

he scouted for the White Sox and Boston Braves for several years and held 
a similar job with the Red Sox when he died, at 72, in Concord, Massachusetts, 
from a heart attack in 1960. To people around the game, Onslow was known 
as one of the most garrulous raconteurs of his day. Onslow also managed 
minor league clubs for six seasons. His Memphis Chicks won 92 games in 
1948, finishing second in the Southern Association, prompting his promotion
