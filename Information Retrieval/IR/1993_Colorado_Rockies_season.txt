The Colorado Rockies' 1993 season was the first for the Rockies. They played 
in the National League West. Don Baylor was their manager. They played 
home games at Mile High Stadium. They finished 37 games behind the NL West 
Champion Atlanta Braves with a record of 67-95, sixth in the division, 
only ahead of the San Diego Padres. Vinny Castilla was the last player 
from the Rockies' inaugural season to retire, playing his last game at 
the end of 2006.[1] As opposed to previous expansion drafts such as the 
1961 draft, players from both leagues were available to the expansion clubs. 
Each existing club could protect fifteen players on their roster from being 
drafted and only one player could be drafted from each team in the first 
round. Then for each additional round National League teams could protect 
an additional 3 players and American League teams could protect 4 more. 
All unprotected major and minor League players were eligible except those 
chosen in the amateur drafts of 1991 or 1992 and players who were 18 or 
younger when signed in 1990. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G
