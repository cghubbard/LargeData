Monroe is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. The population 
was 19,479 at the 2010 census.[1] Like many of its neighbors, Monroe is 
largely considered a bedroom community of New York City and Bridgeport. 
Monroe's neighbors are Easton, Newtown, Oxford, Shelton, and Trumbull. 
The New York Times profiled Monroe in a February 2013 article called "Living 
In Monroe, Conn.; a Friend, in Need and Deed."[2] According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 26.3 square miles (68 km2),

the form of a circle with the words "Town of Monroe Connecticut" written 
in the outer rim of the seal. Inside this outer circle is a profile of

2013 On May 15, 1656, the Court of the Colony of Connecticut in Hartford 
affirmed that the town of Stratford included all of the territory 12 miles 
(19 km) inland from Long Island Sound, between the Housatonic River and 
the Fairfield town line, to include the southern portion of present-day 
Monroe. In 1662, Stratford selectmen Lt. Joseph Judson, Captain Joseph 
Hawley and John Minor had secured all the written deeds of transfer from 
the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation for this vast territory that comprises 
the present-day towns of Trumbull, Shelton and Monroe. In 1671, Stratford 
purchased from the Paugusset Indians the territory which included the remainder 
of the northern portions of Monroe, Trumbull and Shelton, in what is known 
as "The White Hills Purchase", and officially annexed it to the Township 
of Stratford. The school district for Monroe is called Monroe Public Schools 
and includes approximately 4,000 students, in three elementary schools 
(Fawn Hollow, Monroe Elementary, and Stepney Elementary) two middle schools 
(Jockey Hollow and recently opened STEM Academy), and a high school (Masuk 
High School). In 2011, the STEM Academy at Masuk High School was opened 
as an alternative school option for 6th, 7th, and 8th graders.[4] One of 
Monroe's schools (Chalk Hill) was provided to its neighboring town Newtown, 
Connecticut in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[5] 
St. Jude School, a Catholic school with around 220 students, is located 
next to St. Jude Parish on Route 111, very close to Route 111's and 110's 
intersection. St. Jude holds a carnival in the parking lot in the back 
of the church every year in the end of August before the school year begins. 
In 2003, the St. Jude boys junior varsity basketball team won the New England 
CYO tournament, defeating Springfield, Massachusetts in the championship, 
becoming the first team from St. Jude to win the tournament. The first 
selectman of the town dedicated a day to them. In 2005, they returned to 
the tournament in Rhode Island as 8th graders. After defeating Worcester 
and Boston, they lost to Hartford by 5. In 2006, the St. Jude boys junior 
varsity again won the New England CYO tournament, defeating Hartford, Connecticut. 
The town of Monroe features ten houses of worship representing numerous
