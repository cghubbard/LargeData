Jeremiah Lee Accardo (born December 8, 1981) is a former American professional 
baseball pitcher. He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 
the San Francisco Giants, Toronto Blue Jays, Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland 
Indians, and Oakland Athletics. Prior to playing professionally, Accardo 
attended Mesa High School and later Illinois State University. Accardo 
signed as an undrafted free agent by the San Francisco Giants of the National 
League in 2003 after attending Illinois State University. He made his major 
league debut on May 4, 2005, pitching one perfect inning in relief against 
the Arizona Diamondbacks. He finished the 2005 season with a 3.94 ERA, 
1.19 WHIP, 9 walks and 16 strikeouts in 29 2⁄3 innings of work.[1] In 2006, 
Accardo was briefly the team's closer when Armando Benítez suffered an 
ankle injury. . On July 21, 2006, Accardo was traded to the Toronto Blue 
Jays for third baseman Shea Hillenbrand and relief pitcher Vinnie Chulk, 
where he finished the season. In 2006, he posted a combined 5.35 ERA, 1.39 
WHIP, 20 walks and 54 strikeouts in 69 innings of work.[1] In 2007, Accardo 
took the role of closer from Jason Frasor, who had only become the closer 
due to an elbow injury sustained by B. J. Ryan.[2] He began the season 
posting 21 consecutive scoreless innings until allowing 3 runs on May 26, 
2007 in a game against the Minnesota Twins.[3] On September 28, he recorded 
his 30th save of the year. Accardo missed much of the 2008 season because 
of injury. He had a good spring training in 2009 but did not make the Toronto 
Blue Jays 25-man roster out of camp. He started the season at Triple A 
with the Las Vegas 51s.[4] On June 18, his contract was purchased by Toronto 
to replace the injured Scott Downs. At the time, the Blue Jays' pitching 
staff continued to be hit by a string of injuries.[5] He made his first 
2009 major league appearance that day against the Philadelphia Phillies 
in an 8–7 victory and earned the save. After making 31 appearances for 
the Jays over 2009-2010, Toronto did not tender a contract to Accardo prior 
to the 2010 non-tender deadline, thereby making him a free agent.[6] On 
December 14, 2010, Accardo signed a one-year deal worth $1.08 million with 
the Baltimore Orioles.[7] On June 18, 2011, Accardo was designated for 
assignment.[8] He finished the season with a 5.73 ERA and 1.62 WHIP in 
31 appearances [9] and elected free agency on October 11. Accardo signed 
a minor-league contract with the Cleveland Indians on January 19, 2012. 
He was invited to the Indians' spring training camp, but did not make the 
Opening Day roster. His contract was purchased by the Indians' on May 14, 
2012.[10] Accardo was designated for assignment on August 5, 2012 to make 
room on the roster for Chris Seddon[11] and was released on August 9.[12] 
On Aug. 15, 2012, he signed a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics 
and was assigned to the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats. On September 23, 
the Athletics selected his contract from Sacramento, and he made his final 
major league appearance to date, allowing two runs in two innings against 
the Texas Rangers on September 27. On Oct. 18, 2012, the A's announced 
that Accardo had cleared waivers and elected free agency rather than accept 
an outright assignment to Triple-A. On February 5, 2013, he signed a minor 
league contract with the Washington Nationals.[13] He was released on June 
26, 2013 after struggling at Triple-A Syracuse, where he posted a 5.56 
ERA in 22 2⁄3 innings. Accardo began the 2014 season pitching for the Long 
Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball before being 
released. He later signed with the Bridgeport Bluefish to finish out the 
season, posting a combined 4.40 ERA and 1.52 WHIP in 60 appearances.[14]
