The Atlantic League of Professional Baseball is a professional, independent 
baseball league located primarily in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern 
United States, especially the greater metropolitan areas of the Northeast 
megalopolis, with one team located in Texas. The Atlantic League operates 
in cities not served by Major or Minor League Baseball teams and is not 
affiliated with either; most of its teams are within suburbs and exurbs 
too close to other teams in the organized baseball system to have minor 
league franchises of their own. The Atlantic League requires cities to 
have the market for a 4,000 to 7,500-seat ballpark and for the facility 
to be maintained at or above AAA standards.[1] When Atlantic League professionals 
are signed by MLB clubs, they usually start in their Double-A or Triple-A 
affiliates.[2] In 1998, the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball played 
its inaugural season, with teams in Bridgewater, Newark, and Atlantic City, 
New Jersey; Nashua, New Hampshire; Newburgh, New York; and Bridgeport, 
Connecticut. The creation of the league was the result of the New York 
Mets' objection to Frank Boulton's proposal to move the former Albany-Colonie 
Yankees because of its territorial rights to the region. Boulton, a Long 
Island native, decided to create a new league that would have a higher 
salary cap for its players and a longer season than most of the other independent 
baseball organizations. He modeled the Atlantic League after the older 
Pacific Coast League, with facilities that exceed AAA-level standards. 
Boulton also emphasized signing players of Major League Baseball experience 
for all Atlantic League teams, raising the level of play above other independent 
leagues. In 2010, the league announced that it would be expanding to Sugar 
Land, Texas and adding its first franchise not located in an Atlantic coast 
state.[3] The Sugar Land Skeeters began play in 2012. In 2010, amid financial 
struggles, the Newark Bears moved from the Atlantic League to the Can-Am 
League, leaving the Bridgeport Bluefish and Somerset Patriots as the only 
teams remaining from the league's inaugural season.[4] In the summer of 
2013, then-ALPB President Frank Boulton announced that he would be resigning 
so that he could devote more time to operating the Long Island Ducks. He 
was replaced by longtime high-ranking Major League Baseball executive Rick 
White.[5] On July 8, 2015, the Atlantic League began using Rawlings baseballs 
with red and blue seams, virtually unused in the sport since the American 
League swapped the blue in their seams for red in 1934.[6] On September 
1, 2015, the Atlantic League announced conditional approval for an expansion 
team or a relocated team to play in New Britain, Connecticut for the 2016 
season.[7][8][9][10] On October 21, 2015, the Camden Riversharks announced 
they would cease operations immediately due to the inability to reach an 
agreement on lease terms with the owner of Campbell's Field, the Camden 
County Improvement Authority.[11] The team became the New Britain Bees 
for the 2016 season.[12] On May 29, 2016, Jennie Finch was the guest manager 
for the league's Bridgeport Bluefish, thus becoming the first woman to 
manage a professional baseball team.[13] The Atlantic League is generally 
regarded as the most successful and highest level of baseball among independent 
leagues.[14][15] Many notable former and future Major League ballplayers 
including Roger Clemens, Rickey Henderson, Scott Kazmir, Dontrelle Willis, 
Juan González, John Rocker and José Canseco have played in the league and 
several have coached, including Gary Carter, Tommy John, Bud Harrelson 
and Sparky Lyle. The Atlantic League has consistently posted higher per 
game and per season attendance numbers than other independent circuits 
including the American Association, Can-Am League, and Frontier League.[16][17][18][19] 
In 2015, the Atlantic League experienced a watershed moment for independent 
baseball when it signed a formal agreement with Major League Baseball which 
put into writing the rules which the ALPB would follow in selling its players' 
contracts to MLB clubs and their affiliates. This marked the first time 
that MLB, which has enjoyed a U.S. Supreme Court-granted antitrust exemption 
since 1922, had made any formal agreement with or acknowledgment of an 
independent baseball league.[20] League members Moved to another league
