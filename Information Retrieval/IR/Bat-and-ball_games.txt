Bat-and-ball games (or safe haven games to avoid confusion with club games 
such as golf and hockey) are field games played by two opposing teams.[1] 
The teams alternate between "batting" roles, sometimes called "in at bat" 
and "out in the field", or simply in and out. Only the batting team may 
score, but they have equal chances in both roles. The game is counted rather 
than timed. A player on the fielding team puts the ball in play with a 
delivery whose restriction depends on the game. A player on the batting 
team attempts to strike the delivered ball, commonly with a "bat", which 
is a club governed by the rules of the game. After striking the ball, the 
batter may become a runner trying to reach a safe haven or "base". While 
in contact with a base, the runner is safe from the fielding team and in 
a position to score runs. Leaving a safe haven places the runner in danger 
of being put out. The teams switch roles when the fielding team puts the 
batting team out, which varies by game. In modern baseball the fielders 
put three players out; in cricket they retire all players but one. Some 
games permit multiple runners and some have multiple bases to run in sequence. 
Batting may occur, and running begin, at one of the bases. The movement 
between those "safe havens" is governed by the rules of the particular 
game. Globally, cricket and baseball are the two most popular games in 
the family. Striking the ball with a "bat" or any type of stick is not 
crucial. These games use the foot or hand. Otherwise their rules may be 
similar or even identical to baseball. The first two use a large (35Â cm)
