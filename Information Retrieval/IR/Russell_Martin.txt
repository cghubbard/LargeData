Russell Nathan Coltrane Jeanson Martin, Jr. (born February 15, 1983) is 
a Canadian professional baseball catcher for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major 
League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
New York Yankees and Pittsburgh Pirates, and is a four-time MLB All-Star. 
In 2007, Martin won the Gold Glove Award and Silver Slugger Award. Martin 
became the everyday catcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers immediately upon 
his MLB debut in 2006, and continued in that role for nearly five years. 
His offensive and defensive performance earned wide accolades during his 
first three years, but they diminished significantly in 2009 and 2010; 
Martin spent the last two months of 2010 on the disabled list. After the 
Dodgers declined to offer him arbitration in 2011, he signed with the Yankees 
and succeeded Jorge Posada as the Yankees' everyday catcher. In November 
2012, Martin signed a two-year free agent contract with the Pirates and 
took over the team's everyday catcher duties.[1] Following the 2014 season, 
he signed a five-year, $82 million contract with his hometown Blue Jays.[2] 
Martin was selected in the 35th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball 
draft by the Montreal Expos, but did not sign.[3] He then attended Chipola 
College for two years where he met future teammate José Bautista, before 
being chosen in the 17th round of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft 
by the Los Angeles Dodgers.[4] Drafted as a third baseman, Martin played 
his first professional season with the Gulf Coast Dodgers, and hit .286 
with 10 RBI in 41 games.[5] In the offseason, he was converted to a catcher.[4][6] 
Martin played the 2003 minor league season with the Ogden Raptors, and 
was later promoted to the Class-A South Georgia Waves. In 77 combined games, 
he batted .276 with 9 home runs and 50 RBI.[5] Martin was a Florida State 
League All-Star catcher while with the Vero Beach Dodgers in 2004, playing 
122 games and batting .250 with 15 home runs and 64 RBI.[5][7] During the 
offseason, Martin played with the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall 
League.[5] In 2005 he played in a career-high 129 games for the Double-A 
Jacksonville Suns and made the All-Star team, hitting .311 with 9 home 
runs and 61 RBI.[5][7] Martin began the 2006 season with the Triple-A Las 
Vegas 51s, where he hit .297 in 23 games before his promotion.[5] Martin 
was promoted to the Dodgers on May 5, 2006, after a wrist injury to starting 
catcher Dioner Navarro.[6] He got two hits, including a double, in the 
game. His first hit was against Chris Capuano. On May 7, he hit his first 
major league home run against Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Dave Bush. On June 
6, 2006, Martin and Éric Gagné made baseball history by becoming the first 
French Canadian battery in the majors.[8] Martin's play was good enough 
that, on June 26, 2006, Navarro was traded to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.[6][9] 
On August 13, 2006, Martin hit his first career walk-off home run in a 
victory that completed a sweep of the rival San Francisco Giants.[10] On 
September 18, 2006, Martin hit a solo home run off of Trevor Hoffman, the 
third of four consecutive home runs in the bottom of the 9th inning to 
tie the San Diego Padres. It was the first time four home runs had been 
hit in a row since the 1964 Minnesota Twins.[11] On April 21, 2007, Martin 
hit a walk-off grand slam against Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Shawn Chacón 
in the bottom of the 10th inning. This was the first grand slam of his 
career.[12] In May 2007, Martin broke the Dodgers' franchise record for 
single-season steals by a catcher (12) set by John Roseboro in 1962.[13] 
On July 1 it was announced that Martin finished in first place in All-Star 
Game voting, leading Paul Lo Duca by 296,948 votes. He became the first 
ever Canadian born catcher to start the All-Star Game.[14] At the end of 
the 2007 season, he was awarded with the National League Gold Glove Award 
and the Silver Slugger Award.[15][16] On May 2, 2008, Martin started his 
first game at third base since reaching the Majors, allowing veteran backup 
Gary Bennett to spell Martin behind the plate.[17] Martin made his second 
all-star game during the 2008 season.[18] He caught 10 innings of a 15 
inning game in which the American League won 4 to 3.[19] Martin's 10 innings 
caught are tied for fourth place all time among all star catchers in a 
single game. On January 20, 2009, Martin signed a one-year, $3.9 million 
contract to avoid salary arbitration. The deal was the largest ever awarded 
to a catcher in his first year of arbitration.[20] He played for the Canadian 
team during the 2009 World Baseball Classic and then rejoined the Dodgers. 
He slumped offensively in 2009, hitting only .250 with 7 home runs in 143 
games, the weakest totals in his four-year career. In 2010, Martin continued 
to regress as he hit .248 with 5 home runs and 26 RBI in 97 games. In August, 
Martin suffered a torn labrum in his right hip when he was trying to avoid 
a tag at home plate in a game against the Padres. The injury kept him sidelined 
for the rest of the season.[21] Due to his uncertain recovery from injury 
and declining production, and concern that Martin would be awarded a salary 
as high as $6 million in arbitration, the Dodgers did not tender Martin 
a contract for 2011 and allowed him to become a free agent.[22] The Dodgers 
offered Martin a one-year contract worth $4.2 million prior to the arbitration 
hearings but he insisted on receiving well above $5 million.[23] After 
Martin rebuffed the Dodgers' offer, the Dodgers non-tendered him and signed 
journeyman catcher Rod Barajas, though hinting that Martin could still 
have a place on the team. Martin said the Dodgers had shown by avoiding 
arbitration that they no longer "believed in" him.[24] Martin agreed to 
a $6 million guaranteed one-year contract with the New York Yankees for 
the 2011 season. The value of the contract could reach $9.4 million if 
he caught 110 games.[25][26] Martin began the 2011 season as the everyday 
catcher for the Yankees. He was elected to the 2011 American League All-Star 
team as a Yankee. Along with Robinson Canó and Curtis Granderson, Martin 
was one of the Yankees' three batters who hit an MLB record three grand 
slams in a single game in a 22–9 rout of the Oakland Athletics at Yankee 
Stadium on August 25, 2011. As a Super Two player, Martin was eligible 
for arbitration for a fourth time, and he signed a $7.5 million one-year 
contract with up to $100,000 in performance bonuses with the Yankees to 
avoid arbitration on January 24. He spent the year as the starting catcher 
with Chris Stewart as his backup. In 133 games, he hit .211 with 21 HR 
and 53 RBI. Martin started all 9 games of the Yankees postseason, going 
5-31 with 1 HR. On November 29, 2012, Ken Rosenthal reported that the Pittsburgh 
Pirates had signed Martin for two years and $17 million.[27][28] The deal 
became official on November 30.[29][30] On June 4, 2013, Martin made his 
first start and appearance at right field. On June 8, 2013, Martin hit 
his 100th career home run. In the NL Wild Card Game on October 1, 2013, 
Martin hit a pair of solo home runs as the Pirates defeated the Cincinnati 
Reds 6-2. The first was an infamous home run off Reds starter Johnny Cueto. 
Cueto, having his name chanted by 40,000 Pirates fans, dropped the ball 
while on the mound. His next pitch, a fastball over the heart of the plate, 
was crushed into the left-field stands by Martin. This home run gave the 
Pirates the momentum to win the game, their first postseason victory in 
21 years. During a game against the Milwaukee Brewers on April 20, 2014, 
Martin was involved in a brawl that was started after Carlos Gómez hit 
a triple off of Gerrit Cole. Martin was suspended 2 games by the MLB on 
April 22, 2014 for his role in the brawl. On November 18, 2014, the Toronto 
Blue Jays announced that they had signed Martin to a five-year, $82 million 
contract.[2] Early in spring training, manager John Gibbons told reporters 
that Martin would be R. A. Dickey's catcher during practice and in preseason 
games, to give him the opportunity to practice catching Dickey's knuckleball.[31] 
Martin received a standing ovation from the fans at Olympic Stadium on 
April 3, as the Blue Jays played their final two spring training games 
in Montreal for the second consecutive year.[32] On April 19, Martin caught 
Jeff Francis in his debut for the Blue Jays, and in doing so formed the 
first all-Canadian battery in franchise history.[33] On June 2, Martin 
stole home off the back end of a double steal, and in doing so became the 
first Blue Jays player to steal home since Brett Lawrie did so in 2012.[34] 
Martin established a new career-high in home runs on September 26, hitting 
his 22nd of the season to aid the Blue Jays to a 10–8 win over the Tampa 
Bay Rays.[35] He ended the 2015 regular season with a .240 batting average, 
23 home runs, and 77 RBI in 129 games.[36] On October 29, Martin was announced 
as a finalist for the catcher Gold Glove award, along with Salvador Pérez 
and Jason Castro.[37] Martin was first selected to play for Canada during 
the 2009 World Baseball Classic. That year, in an effort to quit the use 
of chewing tobacco, Martin began wearing a custom-fitted mouthpiece during 
the WBC and Spring training.[38] Martin hoped to switch to shortstop during 
the 2013 World Baseball Classic, citing he did not want to learn another 
pitching staff during the tournament, because he was already learning a 
new staff in Pittsburgh. Martin played third base in the minors before 
converting to catcher.[39] Martin would later withdraw his name, citing 
soreness.[40] Martin was born in Toronto, Ontario, and spent his early 
childhood in Montreal, Quebec. He is biracial: his father, Russell Martin 
Sr., is black, while his mother, Suzanne Jeanson, is white. They separated 
when Martin was two years old.[4] His full name is Russell Nathan Coltrane 
Jeanson Martin, Jr. Russell is taken from his father, Nathan from his great-grandfather, 
Jeanson from his mother, and Coltrane to pay homage to John Coltrane.[6] 
His father used to play saxophone in Montreal metro stations to help pay 
for his baseball training.[4] When Martin was eight years old, his mother 
remarried, and he relocated with his mother and sister to Paris, France.[41] 
On April 3, 2015 at the spring training game of the Toronto Blue Jays hosting 
the Cincinnati Reds at Montreal Olympic Stadium, Russell Martin Sr. played 
the Canadian National Anthem on his saxophone.[42] Along with playing baseball 
in the Montreal neighbourhood of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Martin played hockey 
for N.D.G. Minor Hockey. He graduated from Polyvalente Édouard-Montpetit 
High School.[4] After graduating from high school, Martin took a junior 
college scholarship at Chipola College in Marianna, Florida.[43] Martin 
changed the name printed on his jersey to "J. Martin" for the 2009 season 
in reference to one of his middle names "Jeanson", in honour of his mother.[44]
