A lockout is a temporary work stoppage or denial of employment initiated 
by the management of a company during a labor dispute.[1] This is different 
from a strike, in which employees refuse to work. It is usually implemented 
by simply refusing to admit employees onto company premises, and may include 
actions such as changing locks and hiring security guards for the premises. 
Other implementations include a fine for showing up, or a simple refusal 
of clocking-in on the time clock. It is therefore referred to as the antithesis 
of strike.[2] A lockout is generally used to enforce terms of employment 
upon a group of employees during a dispute. A lockout can act to force 
unionized workers to accept changed conditions such as lower wages. If 
the union is asking for higher wages, better benefits or to maintain their 
benefits, an employer may use the threat of a lockout or an actual lockout 
to convince the union to back down. The Dublin Lockout (Irish: Frithdhúnadh 
Mór Bhaile-Átha-Cliath) was a major industrial dispute between approximately 
20,000 workers and 300 employers which took place in Ireland's capital 
city of Dublin. The dispute lasted from 26 August 1913 to 18 January 1914, 
and is often viewed as the most severe and significant industrial dispute 
in Irish history. Central to the dispute was the workers' right to unionize. 
In the United States, under federal labor law, an employer may hire only 
temporary replacements during a lockout. In a strike, unless it is an unfair 
labor practice (ULP) strike, an employer may legally hire permanent replacements. 
Also, in many U.S. states, employees who are locked out are eligible to 
receive unemployment benefits, but are not eligible for such benefits during 
a strike.[citation needed] For the above reasons, many American employers 
have historically been reluctant to impose lockouts, instead attempting 
to provoke a strike. However, as American unions have increasingly begun 
to resort to slowdowns rather than strikes, lockouts have become a more 
common tactic of many employers. Even as incidents of strikes are on the 
decline, incidents of lockouts are on the rise in the U.S. In 1892, after 
several wage cuts and disputes with the employers at the Homestead Steel 
Mill in Homestead, PA, the labor union called for a strike after the company 
stopped discussing its decisions with the union. Henry Clay Frick shut 
down the plant and locked out all of the workers, preventing them from 
entering the mill. Recent notable lockout incidents have been reported 
in professional sports, notably involving Major League Baseball in the 
1990 offseason, the National Basketball Association in the 1995 offseason, 
the 1996 offseason, and the 1998–99 and 2011–12 seasons, the National Hockey 
League in the 1994–95, 2004–05 and 2012–13 seasons, and the National Football 
League in the 2011 offseason. The controversial 2012 NFL referee lockout 
only involved referees and not players. In 2005, the NHL became the first 
major professional sports league in North America to cancel an entire season 
due to a lockout.[citation needed] In September 2016, Long Island University 
became the first institution of higher education to use a lockout against 
its faculty members.[3][4] On 8 April 1998, stevedoring company Patrick 
Corporation sought to restructure its operations for productivity reasons. 
In an industrial watershed event, it sacked all its workers and imposed 
a lockout on wharves around Australia.[5] On 29 October 2011, Qantas Airways 
declared a lockout of all domestic employees in the face of ongoing union 
industrial action. This cancelled all flights, grounding the entire fleet 
for several days.[6] On 2 April 2013, Danish Union of Teachers, DFL (Danish: 
Danmarks Lærerforening) and Local Government Association, KL (Danish: Kommunernes 
Landsforening) declared a lockout for more than 60,000 primary school teachers 
across the country. Over 600,000 students were affected by the lockout 
and could not return to school. DFL and KL were arguing, if the teachers 
should have extra hours working time as KL suggested. DFL were against 
it and could not find a solution.[7] After 24 days of being locked out, 
the teachers lost the battle on the 25th of April 2013 with a government 
intervention which ended the lockout. The current government chose to apply 
all of KL's main demands and the teachers got a small wage raise as compensation. 
The term lock-in refers to the practice of physically preventing workers 
from leaving a workplace. In most jurisdictions this is illegal but is 
occasionally reported, especially in some developing countries.[citation 
needed] Lock-ins should not be confused with a sit-down strike like the 
Flint Sit-Down Strike between the United Automobile Workers and General 
Motors Corporation. More recently, lock-ins have been carried out by employees 
against management, which have been labeled 'bossnapping' by the mainstream 
media. In France during March 2009, 3M's national manager was locked in 
his office for 24 hours by employees in a dispute over redundancies.[8][9][10] 
The following month, union employees of a call center managed by Synovate 
in Auckland locked the front doors of the office, in response to management 
locking them out.[11] Such practices bear some resemblance to the gherao 
in India. It is also caused by disagreement between employer and employees
