San Diego /ˌsæn diːˈeɪɡoʊ/ (Spanish for "Saint Didacus") is a major city 
in California, in San Diego County, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean in 
Southern California, approximately 120 miles (190 km) south of Los Angeles 
and immediately adjacent to the border with Mexico. With an estimated population 
of 1,394,928 as of July 1, 2015,[9] San Diego is the eighth-largest city 
in the United States and second-largest in California. It is part of the 
San Diego–Tijuana conurbation, the second-largest transborder agglomeration 
between the US and a bordering country after Detroit–Windsor, with a population 
of 4,922,723 people.[11] San Diego is known as "the birthplace of California"[12] 
and is known for its mild year-round climate, natural deep-water harbor, 
extensive beaches, long association with the United States Navy and recent 
emergence as a healthcare and biotechnology development center. Historically 
home to the Kumeyaay people, San Diego was the first site visited by Europeans 
on what is now the West Coast of the United States. Upon landing in San 
Diego Bay in 1542, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claimed the entire area for 
Spain, forming the basis for the settlement of Alta California 200 years 
later. The Presidio and Mission San Diego de Alcalá, founded in 1769, formed 
the first European settlement in what is now California. In 1821, San Diego 
became part of the newly-independent Mexico, which reformed as the First 
Mexican Republic two years later. In 1850, it became part of the United 
States following the Mexican–American War and the admission of California 
to the union. The city is the seat of San Diego County and is the economic 
center of the region as well as the San Diego–Tijuana metropolitan area. 
San Diego's main economic engines are military and defense-related activities, 
tourism, international trade, and manufacturing. The presence of the University 
of California, San Diego (UCSD), with the affiliated UCSD Medical Center, 
has helped make the area a center of research in biotechnology. Spanish 
Empire 1769–1821 First Mexican Empire 1821–1823 United Mexican States 1823–1848 
United States 1848–present The original inhabitants of the region are now 
known as the San Dieguito and La Jolla people.[13] The area of San Diego 
has been inhabited by the Kumeyaay people.[14][15] The first European to 
visit the region was Portuguese-born explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo sailing 
under the flag of Castile. Sailing his flagship San Salvador from Navidad, 
New Spain, Cabrillo claimed the bay for the Spanish Empire in 1542, and 
named the site 'San Miguel'.[16] In November 1602, Sebastián Vizcaíno was 
sent to map the California coast. Arriving on his flagship San Diego, Vizcaíno 
surveyed the harbor and what are now Mission Bay and Point Loma and named 
the area for the Catholic Saint Didacus, a Spaniard more commonly known 
as San Diego de Alcalá. On November 12, 1602, the first Christian religious 
service of record in Alta California was conducted by Friar Antonio de 
la Ascensión, a member of Vizcaíno's expedition, to celebrate the feast 
day of San Diego.[17] In May 1769, Gaspar de Portolà established the Fort 
Presidio of San Diego on a hill near the San Diego River. It was the first 
settlement by Europeans in what is now the state of California. In July 
of the same year, Mission San Diego de Alcalá was founded by Franciscan 
friars under Junípero Serra.[18][19] By 1797, the mission boasted the largest 
native population in Alta California, with over 1,400 neophytes living 
in and around the mission proper.[20] Mission San Diego was the southern 
anchor in California of the historic mission trail El Camino Real. Both 
the Presidio and the Mission are National Historic Landmarks.[21][22] In 
1821, Mexico won its independence from Spain, and San Diego became part 
of the Mexican territory of Alta California. In 1822, Mexico began attempting 
to extend its authority over the coastal territory of Alta California. 
The fort on Presidio Hill was gradually abandoned, while the town of San 
Diego grew up on the level land below Presidio Hill. The Mission was secularized 
by the Mexican government in 1833, and most of the Mission lands were sold 
to wealthy Californio settlers. The 432 residents of the town petitioned 
the governor to form a pueblo, and Juan María Osuna was elected the first 
alcalde ("municipal magistrate"), defeating Pío Pico in the vote. (See, 
List of pre-statehood mayors of San Diego.) However, San Diego had been 
losing population throughout the 1830s and in 1838 the town lost its pueblo 
status because its size dropped to an estimated 100 to 150 residents.[23] 
Beyond town Mexican land grants expanded the number of California ranchos 
that modestly added to the local economy. In 1846, the United States went 
to war against Mexico and sent a naval and land expedition to conquer Alta 
California. At first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports 
including San Diego, but the Californios in southern Alta California struck 
back. Following the successful revolt in Los Angeles, the American garrison 
at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846. 
Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24, 1846, 
when the Americans recaptured it. For the next several months the Americans 
were blockaded inside the pueblo. Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers 
shot into the town every night. The Californios drove cattle away from 
the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters 
out. On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of 
General Stephen W. Kearney were at Warner's Ranch. Commodore Robert F. 
Stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain Archibald Gillespie 
to march north to meet him. Their joint command of 150 men, returning to 
San Diego, encountered about 93 Californios under Andrés Pico. In the ensuing 
Battle of San Pasqual, fought in the San Pasqual Valley which is now part 
of the city of San Diego, the Americans suffered their worst losses in 
the campaign. Subsequently, a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from 
San Diego, rescuing Kearny's battered and blockaded command.[24] Stockton 
and Kearny went on to recover Los Angeles and force the capitulation of 
Alta California with the "Treaty of Cahuenga" on January 13, 1847. As a 
result of the Mexican–American War of 1846–48, the territory of Alta California, 
including San Diego, was ceded to the United States by Mexico, under the 
terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. The Mexican negotiators 
of that treaty tried to retain San Diego as part of Mexico, but the Americans 
insisted that San Diego was "for every commercial purpose of nearly equal 
importance to us with that of San Francisco," and the Mexican-American 
border was eventually established to be one league south of the southernmost 
point of San Diego Bay, so as to include the entire bay within the United 
States.[25] The state of California was admitted to the United States in 
1850. That same year San Diego was designated the seat of the newly established 
San Diego County and was incorporated as a city. Joshua H. Bean, the last 
alcalde of San Diego, was elected the first mayor. Two years later the 
city was bankrupt;[26] the California legislature revoked the city's charter 
and placed it under control of a board of trustees, where it remained until 
1889. A city charter was re-established in 1889 and today's city charter 
was adopted in 1931.[27] The original town of San Diego was located at 
the foot of Presidio Hill, in the area which is now Old Town San Diego 
State Historic Park. The location was not ideal, being several miles away 
from navigable water. In 1850, William Heath Davis promoted a new development 
by the Bay shore called "New San Diego", several miles south of the original 
settlement; however, for several decades the new development consisted 
only a few houses, a pier and an Army depot. In the late 1860s, Alonzo 
Horton promoted a move to the bayside area, which he called "New Town" 
and which became Downtown San Diego. Horton promoted the area heavily, 
and people and businesses began to relocate to New Town because of its 
location on San Diego Bay convenient to shipping. New Town soon eclipsed 
the original settlement, known to this day as Old Town, and became the 
economic and governmental heart of the city.[28] Still, San Diego remained 
a relative backwater town until the arrival of a railroad connection in 
1878. In the early part of the 20th century, San Diego hosted two World's 
Fairs: the Panama-California Exposition in 1915 and the California Pacific 
International Exposition in 1935. Both expositions were held in Balboa 
Park, and many of the Spanish/Baroque-style buildings that were built for 
those expositions remain to this day as central features of the park. The 
buildings were intended to be temporary structures, but most remained in 
continuous use until they progressively fell into disrepair. Most were 
eventually rebuilt, using castings of the original façades to retain the 
architectural style.[29] The menagerie of exotic animals featured at the 
1915 exposition provided the basis for the San Diego Zoo.[30] During the 
1950s there was a citywide festival called Fiesta del Pacifico highlighting 
the area's Spanish and Mexican past.[31] In the 2010s there was a proposal 
for a large-scale celebration of the 100th anniversary of Balboa Park, 
but the plans were abandoned when the organization tasked with putting 
on the celebration went out of business.[32] The southern portion of the 
Point Loma peninsula was set aside for military purposes as early as 1852. 
Over the next several decades the Army set up a series of coastal artillery 
batteries and named the area Fort Rosecrans.[33] Significant U.S. Navy 
presence began in 1901 with the establishment of the Navy Coaling Station 
in Point Loma, and expanded greatly during the 1920s.[34] By 1930, the 
city was host to Naval Base San Diego, Naval Training Center San Diego, 
San Diego Naval Hospital, Camp Matthews, and Camp Kearny (now Marine Corps 
Air Station Miramar). The city was also an early center for aviation: as 
early as World War I, San Diego was proclaiming itself "The Air Capital 
of the West".[35] The city was home to important airplane developers and 
manufacturers like Ryan Airlines (later Ryan Aeronautical), founded in 
1925, and Consolidated Aircraft (later Convair), founded in 1923.[36] Charles 
A. Lindbergh's plane The Spirit of St. Louis was built in San Diego in 
1927 by Ryan Airlines.[35] During World War II, San Diego became a major 
hub of military and defense activity, due to the presence of so many military 
installations and defense manufacturers. The city's population grew rapidly 
during and after World War II, more than doubling between 1930 (147,995) 
and 1950 (333,865).[37] During the final months of the war, the Japanese 
had a plan to target multiple U.S. cities for biological attack, starting 
with San Diego. The plan was called "Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night" 
and called for kamikaze planes filled with fleas infected with plague (Yersinia 
pestis) to crash into civilian population centers in the city, hoping to 
spread plague in the city and effectively kill tens of thousands of civilians. 
The plan was scheduled to launch on September 22, 1945, but was not carried 
out because Japan surrendered five weeks earlier.[38][39][40][41] After 
World War II, the military continued to play a major role in the local 
economy, but post-Cold War cutbacks took a heavy toll on the local defense 
and aerospace industries. The resulting downturn led San Diego leaders 
to seek to diversify the city's economy by focusing on research and science, 
as well as tourism.[42] From the start of the 20th century through the 
1970s, the American tuna fishing fleet and tuna canning industry were based 
in San Diego, "the tuna capital of the world".[43] San Diego's first tuna 
cannery was founded in 1911, and by the mid-1930s the canneries employed 
more than 1,000 people. A large fishing fleet supported the canneries, 
mostly staffed by immigrant fishermen from Japan, and later from the Portuguese 
Azores and Italy whose influence is still felt in neighborhoods like Little 
Italy and Point Loma.[44][45] Due to rising costs and foreign competition, 
the last of the canneries closed in the early 1980s.[46] Downtown San Diego 
was in decline in the 1960s and 1970s, but experienced some urban renewal 
since the early 1980s, including the opening of Horton Plaza, the revival 
of the Gaslamp Quarter, and the construction of the San Diego Convention 
Center; Petco Park opened in 2004.[47] According to SDSU professor emeritus 
Monte Marshall, San Diego Bay is "the surface expression of a north-south-trending, 
nested graben". The Rose Canyon and Point Loma fault zones are part of 
the San Andreas Fault system. About 15 miles (24 km) east of the bay are 
the Laguna Mountains in the Peninsular Ranges, which are part of the backbone 
of the American continents.[48] The city lies on approximately 200 deep 
canyons and hills separating its mesas, creating small pockets of natural 
open space scattered throughout the city and giving it a hilly geography.[49] 
Traditionally, San Diegans have built their homes and businesses on the 
mesas, while leaving the urban canyons relatively wild.[50] Thus, the canyons 
give parts of the city a segmented feel, creating gaps between otherwise 
proximate neighborhoods and contributing to a low-density, car-centered 
environment. The San Diego River runs through the middle of San Diego from 
east to west, creating a river valley which serves to divide the city into 
northern and southern segments. The river used to flow into San Diego Bay 
and its fresh water was the focus of the earliest Spanish explorers.[citation 
needed] Several reservoirs and Mission Trails Regional Park also lie between 
and separate developed areas of the city. Notable peaks within the city 
limits include Cowles Mountain, the highest point in the city at 1,591 
feet (485 m);[8] Black Mountain at 1,558 feet (475 m); and Mount Soledad 
at 824 feet (251 m). The Cuyamaca Mountains and Laguna Mountains rise to 
the east of the city, and beyond the mountains are desert areas. The Cleveland 
National Forest is a half-hour drive from downtown San Diego. Numerous 
farms are found in the valleys northeast and southeast of the city. In 
its 2013 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land reported that San 
Diego had the 9th-best park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities.[51] 
ParkScore ranks city park systems by a formula that analyzes acreage, access, 
and service and investment. The city of San Diego recognizes 52 individual 
areas as Community Planning Areas.[52] Within a given planning area there 
may be several distinct neighborhoods. Altogether the city contains more 
than 100 identified neighborhoods. Downtown San Diego is located on San 
Diego Bay. Balboa Park encompasses several mesas and canyons to the northeast, 
surrounded by older, dense urban communities including Hillcrest and North 
Park. To the east and southeast lie City Heights, the College Area, and 
Southeast San Diego. To the north lies Mission Valley and Interstate 8. 
The communities north of the valley and freeway, and south of Marine Corps 
Air Station Miramar, include Clairemont, Kearny Mesa, Tierrasanta, and 
Navajo. Stretching north from Miramar are the northern suburbs of Mira 
Mesa, Scripps Ranch, Rancho Peñasquitos, and Rancho Bernardo. The far northeast 
portion of the city encompasses Lake Hodges and the San Pasqual Valley, 
which holds an agricultural preserve. Carmel Valley and Del Mar Heights 
occupy the northwest corner of the city. To their south are Torrey Pines 
State Reserve and the business center of the Golden Triangle. Further south 
are the beach and coastal communities of La Jolla, Pacific Beach, Mission 
Beach, and Ocean Beach. Point Loma occupies the peninsula across San Diego 
Bay from downtown. The communities of South San Diego, such as San Ysidro 
and Otay Mesa, are located next to the Mexico–United States border, and 
are physically separated from the rest of the city by the cities of National 
City and Chula Vista. A narrow strip of land at the bottom of San Diego 
Bay connects these southern neighborhoods with the rest of the city. For 
the most part, San Diego neighborhood boundaries tend to be understood 
by its residents based on geographical boundaries like canyons and street 
patterns.[53] The city recognized the importance of its neighborhoods when 
it organized its 2008 General Plan around the concept of a "City of Villages".[54] 
San Diego was originally centered in the Old Town district, but by the 
late 1860s the center of focus had relocated to the bayfront in the belief 
that this new location would increase trade. As the "New Town" – present-day 
Downtown – waterfront location quickly developed, it eclipsed Old Town 
as the center of San Diego.[28] The development of skyscrapers over 300 
feet (91 m) in San Diego is attributed to the construction of the El Cortez 
Hotel in 1927, the tallest building in the city from 1927 to 1963.[55] 
As time went on multiple buildings claimed the title of San Diego's tallest 
skyscraper, including the Union Bank of California Building and Symphony 
Towers. Currently the tallest building in San Diego is One America Plaza, 
standing 500 feet (150 m) tall, which was completed in 1991.[56] The downtown 
skyline contains no super-talls, as a regulation put in place by the Federal 
Aviation Administration in the 1970s set a 500 feet (152 m) limit on the 
height of buildings within a one-mile (1.6 km) radius of the San Diego 
International Airport.[57] An iconic description of the skyline includes 
its skyscrapers being compared to the tools of a toolbox.[58] San Diego 
is one of the top-ten best climates in the Farmers' Almanac[59] and is 
one of the two best summer climates in America as scored by The Weather 
Channel.[60] Under the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system, the 
San Diego area has been variously categorized as having either a semi-arid 
climate (BSh in the original classification[61] and BSkn in modified Köppen 
classification)[62] or a Mediterranean climate[63] (Csa and Csb).[64] San 
Diego's climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters 
with most of the annual precipitation falling between December and March. 
The city has a mild climate year-round,[65] with an average of 201 days 
above 70 °F (21 °C) and low rainfall (9–13 inches [230–330 mm] annually). 
The climate in San Diego, like most of Southern California, often varies 
significantly over short geographical distances resulting in microclimates. 
In San Diego, this is mostly because of the city's topography (the Bay, 
and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons). Frequently, particularly 
during the "May gray/June gloom" period, a thick "marine layer" cloud cover 
keeps the air cool and damp within a few miles of the coast, but yields 
to bright cloudless sunshine approximately 5–10 miles (8.0–16.1 km) inland.[66] 
Sometimes the June gloom lasts into July, causing cloudy skies over most 
of San Diego for the entire day.[67][68] Even in the absence of June gloom, 
inland areas experience much more significant temperature variations than 
coastal areas, where the ocean serves as a moderating influence. Thus, 
for example, downtown San Diego averages January lows of 50 °F (10 °C) 
and August highs of 78 °F (26 °C). The city of El Cajon, just 10 miles 
(16 km) inland from downtown San Diego, averages January lows of 42 °F 
(6 °C) and August highs of 88 °F (31 °C). A sign of global warming, scientists 
at Scripps Institution of Oceanography say the average surface temperature 
of the water at Scripps Pier in the California Current has increased by 
almost 3 degrees since 1950.[69] Rainfall along the coast averages about 
10 inches (250 mm) of precipitation annually. The average (mean) rainfall 
is 10.65 inches (271 mm) and the median is 9.6 inches (240 mm).[70] Most 
of the rainfall occurs during the cooler months. The months of December 
through March supply most of the rain, with February the only month averaging 
2 inches (51 mm) or more of rain. The months of May through September tend 
to be almost completely dry. Though there are few wet days per month during 
the rainy period, rainfall can be heavy when it does fall. Rainfall is 
usually greater in the higher elevations of San Diego; some of the higher 
elevation areas of San Diego can receive 11–15 inches (280–380 mm) of rain 
a year. Variability of rainfall can be extreme: in the wettest years of 
1883/1884 and 1940/1941 more than 24 inches (610 mm) fell in the city, 
whilst in the driest years as little as 3.2 inches (80 mm) has fallen for 
a full year. The wettest month on record has been December 1921 with 9.21 
inches (234 mm). Snow in the city is so rare that it has been observed 
only five times in the century-and-a-half that records have been kept. 
In 1949 and 1967, snow stayed on the ground for a few hours in higher locations 
like Point Loma and La Jolla. The other three occasions, in 1882, 1946, 
and 1987, involved flurries but no accumulation.[71] Like most of southern 
California, the majority of San Diego's current area was originally occupied 
by chaparral, a plant community made up mostly of drought-resistant shrubs. 
The endangered Torrey pine has the bulk of its population in San Diego 
in a stretch of protected chaparral along the coast. The steep and varied 
topography and proximity to the ocean create a number of different habitats 
within the city limits, including tidal marsh and canyons. The chaparral 
and coastal sage scrub habitats in low elevations along the coast are prone 
to wildfire, and the rates of fire have increased in the 20th century, 
due primarily to fires starting near the borders of urban and wild areas.[76] 
San Diego's broad city limits encompass a number of large nature preserves, 
including Torrey Pines State Reserve, Los Peñasquitos Canyon Preserve, 
and Mission Trails Regional Park. Torrey Pines State Reserve and a coastal 
strip continuing to the north constitute the only location where the rare 
species of Torrey Pine, P. torreyana torreyana, is found.[77] Due to the 
steep topography that prevents or discourages building, along with some 
efforts for preservation, there are also a large number of canyons within 
the city limits that serve as nature preserves, including Switzer Canyon, 
Tecolote Canyon Natural Park,[78] and Marian Bear Memorial Park in the 
San Clemente Canyon,[79] as well as a number of small parks and preserves. 
San Diego County has one of the highest counts of animal and plant species 
that appear on the endangered species list among counties in the United 
States.[80] Because of its diversity of habitat and its position on the 
Pacific Flyway, San Diego County has recorded the presence of 492 bird 
species, more than any other region in the country.[81] San Diego always 
scores very high in the number of bird species observed in the annual Christmas 
Bird Count, sponsored by the Audubon Society, and it is known as one of 
the "birdiest" areas in the United States.[82][83] San Diego and its backcountry 
are subject to periodic wildfires. In October 2003, San Diego was the site 
of the Cedar Fire, which has been called the largest wildfire in California 
over the past century.[84] The fire burned 280,000 acres (1,100 km2), killed 
15 people, and destroyed more than 2,200 homes.[85] In addition to damage 
caused by the fire, smoke resulted in a significant increase in emergency 
room visits due to asthma, respiratory problems, eye irritation, and smoke 
inhalation; the poor air quality caused San Diego County schools to close 
for a week.[86] Wildfires four years later destroyed some areas, particularly 
within the communities of Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Santa Fe, and Ramona.[87] 
The city had a population of 1,307,402 according to the 2010 census, distributed 
over a land area of 372.1 square miles (963.7 km2). The urban area of San 
Diego extends beyond the administrative city limits and had a total population 
of 2,956,746, making it the third-largest urban area in the state, after 
that of the Los Angeles metropolitan area and San Francisco metropolitan 
area. They, along with the Riverside–San Bernardino, form those metropolitan 
areas in California larger than the San Diego metropolitan area, with a 
total population of 3,095,313 at the 2010 census. As of the Census of 2010, 
there were 1,307,402 people living in the city of San Diego.[93] That represents 
a population increase of just under 7% from the 1,223,400 people, 450,691 
households, and 271,315 families reported in 2000.[94] The estimated city 
population in 2009 was 1,306,300. The population density was 3,771.9 inhabitants 
per square mile (1,456.3/km2). The racial makeup of San Diego was 45.1% 
White, 6.7% African American, 0.6% Native American, 15.9% Asian (5.9% Filipino, 
2.7% Chinese, 2.5% Vietnamese, 1.3% Indian, 1.0% Korean, 0.7% Japanese, 
0.4% Laotian, 0.3% Cambodian, 0.1% Thai). 0.5% Pacific Islander (0.2% Guamanian, 
0.1% Samoan, 0.1% Native Hawaiian), 12.3% from other races, and 5.1% from 
two or more races. The ethnic makeup of the city was 28.8% Hispanic or 
Latino (of any race);[95][96] 24.9% of the total population were Mexican 
American, and 0.6% were Puerto Rican. As of December 2012[update], San 
Diego has the third-largest homeless population in the United States;[97] 
the city's homeless population has the largest percentage of homeless veterans 
in the nation.[97] As of January 1, 2008 estimates by the San Diego Association 
of Governments revealed that the household median income for San Diego 
rose to $66,715, up from $45,733, and that the city population rose to 
1,336,865, up 9.3% from 2000.[98] The population was 45.3% non-Hispanic 
whites, down from 78.9% in 1970,[91] 27.7% Hispanics, 15.6% Asians/Pacific 
Islanders, 7.1% blacks, 0.4% American Indians, and 3.9% from other races. 
Median age of Hispanics was 27.5 years, compared to 35.1 years overall 
and 41.6 years among non-Hispanic whites; Hispanics were the largest group 
in all ages under 18, and non-Hispanic whites constituted 63.1% of population 
55 and older. In 2000 there were 451,126 households out of which 30.2% 
had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.6% were married couples 
living together, 11.4% had a female householder with no husband present, 
and 39.8% were non-families. Households made up of individuals account 
for 28.0% and 7.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or 
older. The average household size was 2.61 and the average family size 
was 3.30. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that in 2000, 24.0% of San Diego 
residents were under 18, and 10.5% were 65 and over.[99] As of 2011[update] 
the median age was 35.6; more than a quarter of residents were under age 
20 and 11% were over age 65.[100] Millennials (ages 18 through 34) constitute 
27.1% of San Diego's population, the second-highest percentage in a major 
U.S. city.[101] The San Diego County regional planning agency, SANDAG, 
provides tables and graphs breaking down the city population into 5-year 
age groups.[102] In 2000, the median income for a household in the city 
was $45,733, and the median income for a family was $53,060.[103] Males 
had a median income of $36,984 versus $31,076 for females. The per capita 
income for the city was $23,609.[103] According to Forbes in 2005, San 
Diego was the fifth wealthiest U.S. city[104] but about 10.6% of families 
and 14.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.0% 
of those under age 18 and 7.6% of those age 65 or over.[103] Nonetheless, 
San Diego was rated the fifth-best place to live in the United States in 
2006 by Money magazine.[105] San Diego was named the ninth-most LGBT-friendly 
city in the U.S. in 2013.[106] The city also has the seventh-highest percentage 
of gay residents in the U.S. Additionally in 2013, San Diego State University 
(SDSU), one of the city's prominent universities, was named one of the 
top LGBT-friendly campuses in the nation.[107] According to a 2014 study 
by the Pew Research Center, 68% of the population of the city identified 
themselves as Christians, with 22% professing attendance at a variety of 
churches that could be considered Protestant, and 32% professing Roman 
Catholic beliefs.[108][109] while 27% claim no religious affiliation. The 
same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, 
and Hinduism) collectively make up about 5% of the population. The largest 
sectors of San Diego's economy are defense/military, tourism, international 
trade, and research/manufacturing, respectively.[110][111] In 2014, San 
Diego was designated by a Forbes columnist as the best city in the country 
to launch a small business or startup company.[112] The economy of San 
Diego is influenced by its deepwater port, which includes the only major 
submarine and shipbuilding yards on the West Coast.[113] Several major 
national defense contractors were started and are headquartered in San 
Diego, including General Atomics, Cubic, and NASSCO.[114][115] San Diego 
hosts the largest naval fleet in the world:[116] In 2008 it was home to 
53 ships, over 120 tenant commands, and more than 35,000 sailors, soldiers, 
Department of Defense civilian employees and contractors.[117] About 5 
percent of all civilian jobs in the county are military-related, and 15,000 
businesses in San Diego County rely on Department of Defense contracts.[117] 
Military bases in San Diego include US Navy facilities, Marine Corps bases, 
and Coast Guard stations. The city is "home to the majority of the U.S. 
Pacific Fleet's surface combatants, all of the Navy's West Coast amphibious 
ships and a variety of Coast Guard and Military Sealift Command vessels".[117][118] 
Tourism is a major industry owing to the city's climate, its beaches, and 
numerous tourist attractions such as Balboa Park, Belmont amusement park, 
San Diego Zoo, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, and SeaWorld San Diego. San Diego's 
Spanish and Mexican heritage is reflected in the many historic sites across 
the city, such as Mission San Diego de Alcala and Old Town San Diego State 
Historic Park. Also, the local craft brewing industry attracts an increasing 
number of visitors[119] for "beer tours" and the annual San Diego Beer 
Week in November;[120] San Diego has been called "America's Craft Beer 
Capital."[121] San Diego County hosted more than 32 million visitors in 
2012; collectively they spent an estimated $8 billion locally. The visitor 
industry provides employment for more than 160,000 people.[122] San Diego's 
cruise ship industry used to be the second-largest in California. Numerous 
cruise lines operate out of San Diego. However, cruise ship business has 
been in steady decline since peaking in 2008, when the Port hosted over 
250 ship calls and more than 900,000 passengers. By 2011 the number of 
ship calls had fallen to 103 (estimated).[123] Local sight-seeing cruises 
are offered in San Diego Bay and Mission Bay. Also available are whale-watching 
cruises to observe the migration of gray whales, peaking in mid-January.[124] 
Sport fishing is another popular tourist attraction; San Diego is home 
to Southern California's biggest sport fishing fleet.[125] San Diego's 
commercial port and its location on the United States-Mexico border make 
international trade an important factor in the city's economy. The city 
is authorized by the United States government to operate as a Foreign Trade 
Zone.[126] The city shares a 15-mile (24 km) border with Mexico that includes 
two border crossings. San Diego hosts the busiest international border 
crossing in the world, in the San Ysidro neighborhood at the San Ysidro 
Port of Entry.[127] A second, primarily commercial border crossing operates 
in the Otay Mesa area; it is the largest commercial crossing on the California-Baja 
California border and handles the third-highest volume of trucks and dollar 
value of trade among all United States-Mexico land crossings.[128] One 
of the Port of San Diego's two cargo facilities is located in Downtown 
San Diego at the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal. This terminal has facilities 
for containers, bulk cargo, and refrigerated and frozen storage, so that 
it can handle the import and export of many commodities.[129] In 2009 the 
Port of San Diego handled 1,137,054 short tons of total trade; foreign 
trade accounted for 956,637 short tons while domestic trade amounted to 
180,417 short tons.[130] Historically tuna fishing and canning was one 
of San Diego's major industries,[131] and although the American tuna fishing 
fleet is no longer based in San Diego, seafood companies Bumble Bee Foods 
and Chicken of the Sea are still headquartered there.[132][133] San Diego 
hosts several major producers of wireless cellular technology. Qualcomm 
was founded and is headquartered in San Diego, and is one of the largest 
private-sector employers in San Diego.[134] Other wireless industry manufacturers 
headquartered here include Nokia, LG Electronics,[135] Kyocera International.,[136] 
Cricket Communications and Novatel Wireless.[137] The largest software 
company in San Diego is security software company Websense Inc.[138] San 
Diego also has the U.S. headquarters for the Slovakian security company 
ESET.[139] San Diego has been designated as an iHub Innovation Center for 
collaboration potentially between wireless and life sciences.[140] The 
presence of the University of California, San Diego and other research 
institutions has helped to fuel biotechnology growth.[141] In 2013, San 
Diego has the second-largest biotech cluster in the United States, below 
the Boston area and above the San Francisco Bay Area.[142] There are more 
than 400 biotechnology companies in the area.[143] In particular, the La 
Jolla and nearby Sorrento Valley areas are home to offices and research 
facilities for numerous biotechnology companies.[144] Major biotechnology 
companies like Illumina and Neurocrine Biosciences are headquartered in 
San Diego, while many biotech and pharmaceutical companies have offices 
or research facilities in San Diego. San Diego is also home to more than 
140 contract research organizations (CROs) that provide a variety of contract 
services for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.[145] According 
to the City's 2015 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[146] the top 
employers in the city are: San Diego has high real estate prices. As of 
May 2015 the median price of a house in San Diego was $520,000.[147] However, 
since February 2016 the median home price has significantly dropped to 
$455,000.[148] The San Diego metropolitan area had one of the worst housing 
affordability of all metropolitan areas in the United States.[149] Consequently, 
San Diego has experienced negative net migration since 2004. A significant 
number of people moved to adjacent Riverside County, commuting daily to 
jobs in San Diego, while others are leaving the region altogether and moving 
to more affordable regions of the country.[150] San Diego home prices peaked 
in 2005, then declined as part of a nationwide trend. As of December 2010, 
home prices were down 36 percent from the peak in 2005.[151] The median 
home price declined by more than $200,000 between 2005 and 2010.[152] Many 
popular museums, such as the San Diego Museum of Art, the San Diego Natural 
History Museum, the San Diego Museum of Man, the Museum of Photographic 
Arts, and the San Diego Air & Space Museum are located in Balboa Park, 
which is also the location of the San Diego Zoo. The Museum of Contemporary 
Art San Diego (MCASD) is located in La Jolla and has a branch located at 
the Santa Fe Depot downtown. The downtown branch consists of two building 
on two opposite streets. The Columbia district downtown is home to historic 
ship exhibits belonging to the San Diego Maritime Museum, headlined by 
the Star of India, as well as the unrelated San Diego Aircraft Carrier 
Museum featuring the USS Midway aircraft carrier. The San Diego Symphony 
at Symphony Towers performs on a regular basis and is directed by Jahja 
Ling. The San Diego Opera at Civic Center Plaza, directed by Ian Campbell, 
was ranked by Opera America as one of the top 10 opera companies in the 
United States. Old Globe Theatre at Balboa Park produces about 15 plays 
and musicals annually. The La Jolla Playhouse at UCSD is directed by Christopher 
Ashley. Both the Old Globe Theatre and the La Jolla Playhouse have produced 
the world premieres of plays and musicals that have gone on to win Tony 
Awards[153] or nominations[154] on Broadway. The Joan B. Kroc Theatre at 
Kroc Center's Performing Arts Center is a 600-seat state-of-the-art theatre 
that hosts music, dance, and theatre performances. The San Diego Repertory 
Theatre at the Lyceum Theatres in Horton Plaza produces a variety of plays 
and musicals. Hundreds of movies and a dozen TV shows have been filmed 
in San Diego, a tradition going back as far as 1898.[155] San Diego is 
home to two major professional teams — the National Football League's San 
Diego Chargers, who play at Qualcomm Stadium, and Major League Baseball's 
San Diego Padres, who play at Petco Park. San Diego hosts three NCAA universities. 
NCAA Division I San Diego State Aztecs men's and women's basketball games 
are played at Viejas Arena. Other prominent Aztec sports include college 
football, as well as soccer, basketball and volleyball. The San Diego State 
Aztecs (MWC) and the San Diego Toreros (WCC) are NCAA Division I teams. 
The UCSD Tritons are members of NCAA Division II. San Diego has hosted 
several sports events. Three NFL Super Bowl championships have been held 
at Qualcomm Stadium. Two of college football's annual bowl games are also 
held at Qualcomm Stadium: the Holiday Bowl and the Poinsettia Bowl. Parts 
of the World Baseball Classic were played at Petco Park in 2006 and 2009. 
Qualcomm Stadium also hosts international soccer games and supercross events. 
Soccer, American football, and track and field are also played in Balboa 
Stadium, the city's first stadium, constructed in 1914.[156] Rugby union 
is a developing sport in the city. The San Diego Breakers begins play in 
the PRO Rugby competition at Torero Stadium in 2016. The USA Sevens, a 
major international rugby event, was held there from 2007 through 2009. 
San Diego is represented by Old Mission Beach Athletic Club RFC,[157] the 
former home club of USA Rugby's former Captain Todd Clever.[158] San Diego 
will participate in the Western American National Rugby League which starts 
in 2011.[159] The San Diego Surf of the American Basketball Association 
is located in the city. The annual Farmers Insurance Open golf tournament 
(formerly the Buick Invitational) on the PGA Tour occurs at Torrey Pines 
Golf Course. This course was also the site of the 2008 U.S. Open Golf Championship. 
The San Diego Yacht Club hosted the America's Cup yacht races three times 
during the period 1988 to 1995. The amateur beach sport Over-the-line was 
invented in San Diego,[160] and the annual world Over-the-line championships 
are held at Mission Bay every year.[161] The city is governed by a mayor 
and a 9-member city council. In 2006, the city's form of government changed 
from a council–manager government to a strong mayor government. The change 
was brought about by a citywide vote in 2004. The mayor is in effect the 
chief executive officer of the city, while the council is the legislative 
body.[162] The City of San Diego is responsible for police, public safety, 
streets, water and sewer service, planning and zoning, and similar services 
within its borders. San Diego is a sanctuary city,[163] however, San Diego 
County is a participant of the Secure Communities program.[164][165] As 
of 2011[update], the city had one employee for every 137 residents, with 
a payroll greater than $733 million.[166] The members of the city council 
are each elected from single member districts within the city. The mayor 
and city attorney are elected directly by the voters of the entire city. 
The mayor, city attorney, and council members are elected to four-year 
terms, with a two-term limit.[167] Elections are held on a non-partisan 
basis per California state law; nevertheless, most officeholders do identify 
themselves as either Democrats or Republicans. In 2007, registered Democrats 
outnumbered Republicans by about 7 to 6 in the city,[168] and Democrats 
currently (as of 2015[update]) hold a 5-4 majority in the city council. 
The current mayor, Kevin Faulconer, is a Republican. San Diego is part 
of San Diego County, and includes all or part of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 
4th supervisorial districts of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors,[169] 
Other county officers elected in part by city residents include the Sheriff, 
District Attorney, Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk, and Treasurer/Tax Collector. 
Areas of the city immediately adjacent to San Diego Bay ("tidelands") are 
administered by the Port of San Diego, a quasi-governmental agency which 
owns all the property in the tidelands and is responsible for its land 
use planning, policing, and similar functions. San Diego is a member of 
the regional planning agency San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG). 
Public schools within the city are managed and funded by independent school 
districts (see above). In the California State Senate, San Diego is split 
between the 38th, 39th and 40th districts,[170] represented by Joel Anderson 
(R), Marty Block (D), and Ben Hueso (D), respectively. In the California 
State Assembly, San Diego is split between the 77th, 78th, 79th, and 80th 
districts,[171] represented by Brian Maienschein (R), and Toni Atkins (D), 
Shirley Weber (D), and Lorena Gonzalez (D), respectively. In the United 
States House of Representatives, San Diego is split between California's 
49th, 50th, 51st, 52nd, and 53rd congressional districts,[172] represented 
by Darrell Issa (R), Duncan D. Hunter (R), Juan Vargas (D), Scott Peters 
(D), and Susan Davis (D), respectively. San Diego was the site of the 1912 
San Diego free speech fight, in which the city restricted speech, vigilantes 
brutalized and tortured anarchists, and the San Diego Police Department 
killed an IWW member. In 1916, rainmaker Charles Hatfield was blamed for 
$4 million in damages and accused of causing San Diego's worst flood, during 
which about 20 Japanese American farmers died.[173] Then-mayor Roger Hedgecock 
was forced to resign his post in 1985, after he was found guilty of one 
count of conspiracy and twelve counts of perjury, related to the alleged 
failure to report all campaign contributions.[174][175] After a series 
of appeals, the twelve perjury counts were dismissed in 1990 based on claims 
of juror misconduct; the remaining conspiracy count was reduced to a misdemeanor 
and then dismissed.[176] A 2002 scheme to underfund pensions for city employees 
led to the San Diego pension scandal. This resulted in the resignation 
of newly re-elected Mayor Dick Murphy[177] and the criminal indictment 
of six pension board members.[178] Those charges were finally dismissed 
by a federal judge in 2010.[179] On November 28, 2005, U.S. Congressman 
Randy "Duke" Cunningham resigned after being convicted on federal bribery 
charges. He had represented California's 50th congressional district, which 
includes much of the northern portion of the city of San Diego. In 2006, 
Cunningham was sentenced to a 100-month prison sentence.[180] In 2005 two 
city council members, Ralph Inzunza and Deputy Mayor Michael Zucchet – 
who briefly took over as acting mayor when Murphy resigned – were convicted 
of extortion, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for taking 
campaign contributions from a strip club owner and his associates, allegedly 
in exchange for trying to repeal the city's "no touch" laws at strip clubs.[181] 
Both subsequently resigned. Inzunza was sentenced to 21 months in prison.[182] 
In 2009, a judge acquitted Zucchet on seven out of the nine counts against 
him, and granted his petition for a new trial on the other two charges;[183] 
the remaining charges were eventually dropped.[184] In July 2013, three 
former supporters of mayor Bob Filner asked him to resign because of allegations 
of repeated sexual harassment.[185] Over the ensuing six weeks, 18 women 
came forward to publicly claim that Filner had sexually harassed them,[186] 
and multiple individuals and groups called for him to resign. Filner agreed 
to resign effective August 30, 2013, subsequently pleaded guilty to one 
felony count of false imprisonment and two misdemeanor battery charges, 
and was sentenced to house arrest and probation.[187][188] San Diego was 
ranked as the 20th-safest city in America in 2013 by Business Insider.[189] 
According to Forbes magazine, San Diego was the ninth-safest city in the 
top 10 list of safest cities in the U.S. in 2010.[190] Like most major 
cities, San Diego had a declining crime rate from 1990 to 2000. Crime in 
San Diego increased in the early 2000s.[191][192][193] In 2004, San Diego 
had the sixth lowest crime rate of any U.S. city with over half a million 
residents.[193] From 2002 to 2006, the crime rate overall dropped 0.8%, 
though not evenly by category. While violent crime decreased 12.4% during 
this period, property crime increased 1.1%. Total property crimes per 100,000 
people were lower than the national average in 2008.[194] According to 
Uniform Crime Report statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI) in 2010, there were 5,616 violent crimes and 30,753 property crimes. 
Of these, the violent crimes consisted of forcible rapes, 73 robberies 
and 170 aggravated assaults, while 6,387 burglaries, 17,977 larceny-thefts, 
6,389 motor vehicle thefts and 155 acts of arson defined the property offenses.[195] 
In 2013, San Diego had the lowest murder rate of the ten largest cities 
in the United States.[196] Public schools in San Diego are operated by 
independent school districts. The majority of the public schools in the 
city are served by the San Diego Unified School District, the second-largest 
school district in California, which includes 11 K-8 schools, 107 elementary 
schools, 24 middle schools, 13 atypical and alternative schools, 28 high 
schools, and 45 charter schools.[197] Several adjacent school districts 
which are headquartered outside the city limits serve some schools within 
the city; these include the Poway Unified School District, Del Mar Union 
School District, San Dieguito Union High School District and Sweetwater 
Union High School District. In addition, there are a number of private 
schools in the city. According to education rankings released by the U.S. 
Census Bureau, 40.4 percent of San Diegans ages 25 and older hold bachelor's 
degrees. The census ranks the city as the ninth-most educated city in the 
United States based on these figures.[198] Public colleges and universities 
in the city include San Diego State University (SDSU), University of California, 
San Diego (UCSD), and the San Diego Community College District, which includes 
San Diego City College, San Diego Mesa College, and San Diego Miramar College. 
Private colleges and universities in the city include University of San 
Diego (USD), Point Loma Nazarene University (PLNU), Alliant International 
University (AIU), National University, California International Business 
University (CIBU), San Diego Christian College, John Paul the Great Catholic 
University, California College San Diego, Coleman University, University 
of Redlands School of Business, Design Institute of San Diego (DISD), Fashion 
Institute of Design & Merchandising's San Diego campus, NewSchool of Architecture 
and Design, Pacific Oaks College San Diego Campus, Chapman University's 
San Diego Campus, The Art Institute of California – San Diego, Platt College, 
Southern States University (SSU), UEI College, and Woodbury University 
School of Architecture's satellite campus. There is one medical school 
in the city, the UCSD School of Medicine. There are three ABA accredited 
law schools in the city, which include California Western School of Law, 
Thomas Jefferson School of Law, and University of San Diego School of Law. 
There is also one law school, Western Sierra Law School, not accredited 
by the ABA. The city-run San Diego Public Library system is headquartered 
downtown and has 36 branches throughout the city.[199] The newest location 
will be one in Skyline Hills, which has just broken ground.[200] The libraries 
have had reduced operating hours since 2003 due to the city's financial 
problems. In 2006 the city increased spending on libraries by $2.1 million.[201] 
A new nine-story Central Library on Park Boulevard at J Street opened on 
September 30, 2013.[202] In addition to the municipal public library system, 
there are nearly two dozen libraries open to the public which are run by 
other governmental agencies and by schools, colleges, and universities.[203] 
Noteworthy among them are the Malcolm A. Love Library at San Diego State 
University and the Geisel Library at the University of California, San 
Diego. The following are published within the city: the daily newspaper, 
U-T San Diego and its online portal, of the same name,[204] and the alternative 
newsweeklies, the San Diego CityBeat and San Diego Reader. Times of San 
Diego is a free online newspaper covering local news in the metropolitan 
area. Voice of San Diego is a non-profit online-only news outlet covering 
government, politics, education, neighborhoods, and the arts. The San Diego 
Daily Transcript is a business-oriented daily newspaper. San Diego led 
U.S. local markets with 69.6 percent broadband penetration in 2004 according 
to Nielsen//NetRatings.[205] San Diego's first television station was KFMB, 
which began broadcasting on May 16, 1949.[206] Since the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) licensed seven television stations in Los Angeles, two 
VHF channels were available for San Diego because of its relative proximity 
to the larger city. In 1952, however, the FCC began licensing UHF channels, 
making it possible for cities such as San Diego to acquire more stations. 
Stations based in Mexico (with ITU prefixes of XE and XH) also serve the 
San Diego market. Television stations today include XHTJB 3 (Once TV), 
XETV 6 (CW), KFMB 8 (CBS), KGTV 10 (ABC), XEWT 12 (Televisa Regional), 
KPBS 15 (PBS), KBNT-CD 17 (Univision), XHTIT-TDT 21 (Azteca 7), XHJK-TDT 
27 (Azteca 13), XHAS 33 (Telemundo), K35DG-D 35 (UCSD-TV), KDTF-LD 51 (Telefutura), 
KNSD 39 (NBC), KZSD-LP 41 (Azteca America), KSEX-CD 42 (Infomercials), 
XHBJ-TDT 45 (Gala TV), XHDTV 49 (MNTV), KUSI 51 (Independent), XHUAA-TDT 
57 (Canal de las Estrellas), and KSWB-TV 69 (Fox). San Diego has an 80.6 
percent cable penetration rate.[207] Due to the ratio of U.S. and Mexican-licensed 
stations, San Diego is the largest media market in the United States that 
is legally unable to support a television station duopoly between two full-power 
stations under FCC regulations, which disallow duopolies in metropolitan 
areas with fewer than nine full-power television stations and require that 
there must be eight unique station owners that remain once a duopoly is 
formed (there are only seven full-power stations on the California side 
of the San Diego-Tijuana market).[citation needed] Though the E. W. Scripps 
Company owns KGTV and KZSD-LP, they are not considered a duopoly under 
the FCC's legal definition as common ownership between full-power and low-power 
television stations in the same market is permitted regardless to the number 
of stations licensed to the area. As a whole, the Mexico side of the San 
Diego-Tijuana market has two duopolies and one triopoly (Entravision Communications 
owns both XHAS-TV and XHDTV-TV, Azteca owns XHJK-TV and XHTIT-TV, and Grupo 
Televisa owns XHUAA-TV and XHWT-TV along with being the license holder 
for XETV-TV, which is run by California-based subsidiary Bay City Television). 
San Diego's television market is limited to only San Diego county. The 
Imperial Valley has its own market (which also extends into western Arizona), 
while neighboring Orange and Riverside counties are part of the Los Angeles 
market. (Sometimes in the past, a missing network affiliate in the Imperial 
Valley would be available on cable TV from San Diego.) The radio stations 
in San Diego include nationwide broadcaster, Clear Channel Communications; 
CBS Radio, Midwest Television, Lincoln Financial Media, Finest City Broadcasting, 
and many other smaller stations and networks. Stations include: KOGO AM 
600, KFMB AM 760, KCEO AM 1000, KCBQ AM 1170, K-Praise, KLSD AM 1360 Air 
America, KFSD 1450 AM, KPBS-FM 89.5, Channel 933, Star 94.1, FM 94/9, FM 
News and Talk 95.7, Q96 96.1, KyXy 96.5, Free Radio San Diego (AKA Pirate 
Radio San Diego) 96.9FM FRSD, KSON 97.3/92.1, KXSN 98.1, Jack-FM 100.7, 
101.5 KGB-FM, KLVJ 102.1, Rock 105.3, and another Pirate Radio station 
at 106.9FM, as well as a number of local Spanish-language radio stations. 
Water is supplied to residents by the Water Department of the City of San 
Diego. The city receives most of its water from the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California. Gas and electric utilities are provided 
by San Diego Gas & Electric, a division of Sempra Energy. In the middle 
part of the 20th century the city had mercury vapor street lamps. In 1978 
the city decided to replace them with more efficient sodium vapor lamps. 
The proposal triggered an outcry from astronomers at Palomar Observatory 
60 miles (97 km) north of the city; they said the proposed lamps would 
increase light pollution and interfere with astronomical observation.[208] 
The city altered its lighting regulations to limit light pollution within 
30 miles (48 km) of Palomar.[209] In 2011, the city announced plans to 
upgrade 80% of its street lighting to new energy-efficient street lights 
which use induction technology, a modified form of fluorescent lamp that 
produces a broader spectrum than sodium-vapor lamps. The new system is 
predicted to save $2.2 million per year in energy and maintenance costs.[210] 
The city stated the changes would "make our neighborhoods safer."[210] 
They also increase light pollution.[211] In 2014, San Diego announced plans 
to become the first U.S. city to install cyber-controlled street lighting, 
using an "intelligent" lighting system to control 3,000 LED street lights.[212] 
With the automobile being the primary means of transportation for over 
80 percent of its residents, San Diego is served by a network of freeways 
and highways. This includes Interstate 5, which runs south to Tijuana and 
north to Los Angeles; Interstate 8, which runs east to Imperial County 
and the Arizona Sun Corridor; Interstate 15, which runs northeast through 
the Inland Empire to Las Vegas and Salt Lake City; and Interstate 805, 
which splits from I-5 near the Mexican border and rejoins I-5 at Sorrento 
Valley. Major state highways include SR 94, which connects downtown with 
I-805, I-15 and East County; SR 163, which connects downtown with the northeast 
part of the city, intersects I-805 and merges with I-15 at Miramar; SR 
52, which connects La Jolla with East County through Santee and SR 125; 
SR 56, which connects I-5 with I-15 through Carmel Valley and Rancho Peñasquitos; 
SR 75, which spans San Diego Bay as the San Diego-Coronado Bridge, and 
also passes through South San Diego as Palm Avenue; and SR 905, which connects 
I-5 and I-805 to the Otay Mesa Port of Entry. The stretch of SR 163 that 
passes through Balboa Park is San Diego's oldest freeway, and has been 
called one of America's most beautiful parkways.[213] San Diego's roadway 
system provides an extensive network of routes for travel by bicycle. The 
dry and mild climate of San Diego makes cycling a convenient and pleasant 
year-round option. At the same time, the city's hilly, canyon-like terrain 
and significantly long average trip distances—brought about by strict low-density 
zoning laws—somewhat restrict cycling for utilitarian purposes. Older and 
denser neighborhoods around the downtown tend to be utility cycling oriented. 
This is partly because of the grid street patterns now absent in newer 
developments farther from the urban core, where suburban style arterial 
roads are much more common. As a result, a vast majority of cycling-related 
activities are recreational. Testament to San Diego's cycling efforts, 
in 2006, San Diego was rated as the best city for cycling for U.S. cities 
with a population over 1 million.[214] San Diego is served by the San Diego 
Trolley light rail system,[215] by the SDMTS bus system,[216] and by Coaster[217] 
and Amtrak Pacific Surfliner[218] commuter rail; northern San Diego county 
is also served by the Sprinter light rail line.[219] The Trolley primarily 
serves downtown and surrounding urban communities, Mission Valley, east 
county, and coastal south bay. A planned Mid-Coast extension of the Trolley 
will operate from Old Town to University City and the University of California, 
San Diego along the I-5 Freeway, with planned operation by 2018. The Amtrak 
and Coaster trains currently run along the coastline and connect San Diego 
with Los Angeles, Orange County, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura 
via Metrolink and the Pacific Surfliner. There are two Amtrak stations 
in San Diego, in Old Town and the Santa Fe Depot downtown. San Diego transit 
information about public transportation and commuting is available on the 
Web and by dialing "511" from any phone in the area.[220] The city has 
two major commercial airports within or extending into its city limits. 
San Diego International Airport (SAN), also known as Lindbergh Field, near 
downtown, is the busiest single-runway airport in the United States.[221] 
It served over 17 million passengers in 2005, and is dealing with an increasingly 
larger number every year.[221] It is located on San Diego Bay three miles 
(4.8 km) from downtown. San Diego International Airport maintains scheduled 
flights to the rest of the United States including Hawaii, as well as to 
Canada, Mexico, Japan, and the United Kingdom. It is operated by an independent 
agency, the San Diego Regional Airport Authority. Tijuana International 
Airport has a terminal within the San Diego city limits in the Otay Mesa 
district connected to the rest of the airport in Tijuana, Mexico via the 
Cross Border Xpress cross-border footbridge. It is the primary airport 
for flights to the rest of Mexico, and connections via Mexico City to the 
rest of Latin America. In addition, the city itself operates two general-aviation 
airports, Montgomery Field (MYF) and Brown Field (SDM).[222] Numerous regional 
transportation projects have occurred in recent years to mitigate congestion 
in San Diego. Notable efforts are improvements to San Diego freeways, expansion 
of San Diego Airport, and doubling the capacity of the cruise ship terminal 
of the port. Freeway projects included expansion of Interstates 5 and 805 
around "The Merge," a rush-hour spot where the two freeways meet. Also, 
an expansion of Interstate 15 through the North County is underway with 
the addition of high-occupancy-vehicle (HOV) "managed lanes". There is 
a tollway (The South Bay Expressway) connecting SR 54 and Otay Mesa, near 
the Mexican border. According to a 2007 assessment, 37 percent of streets 
in San Diego were in acceptable driving condition. The proposed budget 
fell $84.6 million short of bringing the city's streets to an acceptable 
level.[223] Port expansions included a second cruise terminal on Broadway 
Pier which opened in 2010. Airport projects include expansion of Terminal 
2, currently under construction and slated for completion in summer 2013.[224]
