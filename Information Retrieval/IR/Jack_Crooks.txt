John Charles "Jack" Crooks (November 9, 1865 â€“ February 2, 1918) was an 
American Major League Baseball infielder born in St. Paul, Minnesota. He 
played mainly as a second base, but did spend some time playing third base 
for four different teams during his eight seasons ranging from 1889 to 
1898.[1] Crooks also amassed a career on-base percentage of .386 despite 
a Batting average of just .240, due to large part to the high walks totals 
he compiled. Crooks was well known in his era as an extremely patient hitter, 
often fouling off many pitches until he got one that he could hit.[2] This 
approach led him to draw many walks (also, "bases on balls", or BB), in 
fact, he held the record for walks by rookie second basemen as well, when 
he walked 96 times for the Columbus Solons of the American Association 
in 1890. He held this record until Jim Gilliam of the Brooklyn Dodgers 
walked 100 times in 1953.[3] Despite hitting just .213 in 1892, he walked 
a league-leading 136 times put his on-base percentage (OBP) at .400, good 
for fifth in National League. He also became the Major League single-season 
record holder in that category, a title he held until Jimmy Sheckard walked 
147 times in 1911.[4] That total remained the St Louis Browns/Cardinals 
single-season franchise record until 1998, when Mark McGwire walked 162 
times.[5] The next season, while batting just .237, Crooks' league-leading 
121 BB put his OBP at .408.[6] In addition to playing for Columbus, Crooks 
also had stints with the Washington Senators, Louisville Colonels, and 
the St. Louis Browns on two different occasions. During his first tenure, 
he was named as their player-manager, in 1892 on an interim basis twice 
that season. His short managerial career produced a record of 27 wins and 
33 losses, with the team finishing a distant 11th place in the National 
League standings.[7] Jack died at the age of 52 in St. Louis, Missouri
