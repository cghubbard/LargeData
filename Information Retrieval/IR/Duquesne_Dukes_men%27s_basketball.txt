The Duquesne Dukes represent Duquesne University in college basketball. 
The team, which started in 1914, has only ever played in NCAA Division 
I and has had five appearances in the NCAA Tournament. The Dukes play in 
the Atlantic 10 Conference, of which they have been members since 1976 
(minus the 1992–93 season in which the Dukes were single-season members 
of the Midwestern Collegiate Conference). The Dukes men's basketball team 
has had great success over the years, playing twice in national championship 
games in the 1950s and winning the National Invitation Tournament championship 
in 1955. Duquesne also won the 1976–77 Eastern Collegiate Basketball League 
championship (the forerunner to the Eastern Athletic Association, now known 
as the Atlantic 10 Conference) and 1979–80 and 1980–81 Eastern Athletic 
Association regular season co-championships. The Associated Press ranked 
Duquesne as the No. 1 college basketball team in the country for two consecutive 
weeks during the 1953-54 season.[2] Duquesne is the only school to have 
back-to-back first overall picks in the National Basketball Association 
Draft (Dick Ricketts by the Saint Louis Hawks in 1955 and Sihugo Green 
by the Rochester Royals in 1956). The Dukes men's basketball program can 
also claim the first African-American player selected in an NBA draft (Chuck 
Cooper by the Boston Celtics in 1950). The 1939–40 Dukes basketball team 
finished with a 20–3 record and appeared in the Final Four of both the 
NIT and NCAA Tournaments. Duquesne has had the most Atlantic 10 scoring 
champions in conference history. The history of basketball at Duquesne 
University can be dated back to 1914, when the university administration 
established basketball as a varsity sport. The first game, against Bethany 
College, was won in a gym under the college chapel on January 9, 1914 (Rishel 
23). The team was first coached by Alexander Hogarty, whose tenure lasted 
only one season. The position was filled by Father Eugene McGuigan, who 
was called "Father Mac" on campus and "Coach Gene Martin" in newspaper 
reports in order to prevent the name of a Holy Ghost father from being 
associated with the rowdiness of "Basket-ball". Father McGuigan coached 
football, baseball, and basketball until he was transferred from Duquesne 
University in 1923 (Rishel 38). When a proper gymnasium was constructed 
in 1923, Duquesne Basketball was finally allowed to come into its own, 
as the previous court was in reality a stage below the chapel and was not 
only slanted but demarcated by a steel cage on its perimeter. Teams had 
previously refused to play the "Bluffites" on their home court. Coach "Chick" 
Davies initiated a new era in the basketball program, filling the 1,200-seat 
gymnasium and bringing the team into national prominence. In its first 
season with Davies, Duquesne tied with Waynesburg University for the Tri-State 
Conference championship and dominated the same conference in 1926 and 1927 
before moving to a higher level of competition. The season expanded from 
20 to 28 games and became more competitive in 1930 when the team faced 
the University of Iowa, Loyola University Chicago, Adrian College, Elmhurst 
College, Alfred State College, John Carroll University, American University, 
Catholic University, Colgate University, St. Bonaventure University, Seton 
Hall University, Manhattan College, and the City College of New York. Davies, 
immensely popular, coached Duquesne basketball until 1948 (Rishel 40–41). 
The university tried to hold on to basketball during World War II, having 
reworked the gymnasium in 1942 to seat an extra 800 spectators, but was 
forced to drop the sport at the end of the 1943 season (Rishel 81–82). 
However, the sport was reinstated in the spring of 1946. During the 1946-1947 
season Davies led the Dukes to 19 straight victories before a loss to Georgetown 
University. In that same season, Duquesne received its third invitation 
to the NIT, losing by one point to the University of Utah, the eventual 
champion, which it had defeated during the regular season (Rishel 101). 
During this first postwar season, the University of Tennessee refused to 
play a scheduled game against Duquesne at the McKeesport (PA) Vocational 
High School because the Dukes had a black player--Chuck Cooper. The December 
23, 1946, game had been highly anticipated since Tennessee had two All-Americans 
and four other returning lettermen. As Davies refused to remove Cooper 
from the squad, Tennessee canceled at the last minute. That fall, Cooper 
became the first African-American drafted to play professional basketball 
when he joined the Boston Celtics (Rishel 101). Dukes Basketball continued 
to impress with a new coach in the 1949 season--Donald "Dudey" Moore. Moore's 
team achieved a 17–5 record in the 1949 season, and in 1950, 23 wins and 
another bid to the NIT. By the 1950s, Duquesne's Locust Street gym had 
become inadequate to seat the team's spectators, so games were usually 
played in a high school gym in McKeesport or the Duquesne Gardens in Oakland. 
Even at this point, daily practice was held at North Catholic High School 
(Rishel 102). The 1950s marked an age of immense success for Dukes Basketball, 
with Moore leading his team to six NIT bids, during which time Moore was 
named "United Press Coach of the Year" and achieved a school-record 21–1 
season (1951–52). In 1953, Duquesne was rated as a preseason "best in the 
East" and possibly the nation. With a 23–2 record, they were top seed for 
the NIT that year. Although they lost to the College of the Holy Cross, 
they achieved a new record of 26 victories in a season. Top-seeded again 
in '54, Duquesne, following a 19–4 regular season, finally won the title 
of NIT Champions in 1955 (Rishel 137–138). The 1956 season almost came 
to an early end, as the John Harris Gardens, then Duquesne's home court, 
was to be demolished. However, in a gesture which athletic director Doc 
Skender called "one of the finest acts of sportsmanship I've ever known," 
long-standing rival the University of Pittsburgh allowed the Dukes use 
of the Fitzgerald Field House for home games (Rishel 138). Coach Red Manning, 
initially unpopular, soon led the Dukes to another era of NIT invitations, 
ending up in the Final Four in the '61–62 season, the Elite Eight in '63–64, 
and four more bids between 1967 and the 1970–71 season. Notable in this 
decade was Willie Somerset, nicknamed by the press as "Wonderful Willie." 
Though only 5'11", he could jump higher than any other player on the team 
(Rishel 177). The 1970s saw the end of Manning's tenure. Duquesne had seen 
only four different basketball coaches in fifty years, but this decade 
alone saw three coaches: Manning, John Cinicola, and Mike Rice. The decade 
was relatively lackluster, although it saw the likes of "the greatest guard 
in Duquesne basketball history"--Norm Nixon (Rishel 216). The 1980s were 
marked by problems with many players' academic eligibility—calling into 
question the university's recruiting and support procedures—and are best 
described as "trying times" for the Dukes (Rishel 246). There were only 
two winning seasons in the decade--'80–81 and '85–86. Even so, the 1988 
construction of the A. J. Palumbo Center—Duquesne Basketball's current 
home—is a notable event of this time period. The Dukes have struggled in 
the 21st century, reaching only one NIT tournament (eliminated in the first 
round) and two College Basketball Invitational tournaments (only once making 
it to the second round). Despite coming off a second straight winning season, 
coach Ron Everhart was fired after the 2011-2012 season; the university 
cited a lack of postseason success as the main reason for the firing[4] 
The Dukes have appeared in the NCAA Tournament five times. Their combined 
record is 4–5. The Dukes have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament 
(NIT) 17 times. Their combined record is 17–19. They were NIT champions 
in 1955. The Dukes have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational 
(CBI) three times. Their combined record is 2-3. The Dukes appeared in 
the only National Campus Basketball Tournament. Their record is 0–1. On 
January 27, 2001, during the halftime of a game against Xavier University 
(Cincinnati), the Duquesne University Department of Athletics retired the 
jerseys of five of its all-time greatest players: Chuck Cooper, Sihugo 
Green, Norm Nixon, Dick Ricketts and Willie Somerset.[3] Updated Through
