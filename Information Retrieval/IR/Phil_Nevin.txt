Phillip Joseph Nevin (born January 19, 1971) is an American professional 
baseball coach for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB).[1] 
He spent twelve seasons as a player in MLB (1995–2006), appearing in 1,217 
games played for the Houston Astros, Detroit Tigers, Anaheim Angels, San 
Diego Padres, Texas Rangers, Chicago Cubs and Minnesota Twins. Nevin attended 
California State University, Fullerton where he played college baseball 
for the Cal State Fullerton Titans team. He led the Titans to the championship 
game in the 1992 College World Series (CWS), after which he was named the 
CWS Most Outstanding Player and won the Golden Spikes Award. Chosen with 
the first-overall pick in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft, Nevin went 
on to play in MLB for seven teams across 12 seasons. He was selected to 
appear in the 2001 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. After retiring, 
Nevin stayed involved in baseball. He briefly went into broadcasting, then 
managed the unaffiliated Orange County Flyers for a season. He managed 
the Class AA Erie SeaWolves and the Class AAA Toledo Mud Hens in the Tigers 
organization before joining the Arizona Diamondbacks organization in 2014, 
managing the Reno Aces, the club's Triple-A affiliate in the Pacific Coast 
League. He spent the 2014–16 seasons as Reno's manager, compiling a 227–205 
(.525) record. He then returned to MLB with the Giants for 2017, named 
third base coach by manager Bruce Bochy, who was Nevin's skipper for six 
years in San Diego.[1] Nevin attended El Dorado High School in Placentia, 
California.[2] After graduating, he was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers 
in the third round of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft with the 82nd 
overall selection.[3] He decided to attend California State University, 
Fullerton after turning down an offer that included a signing bonus of 
$100,000.[4] A two-sport star, Nevin played American football and baseball 
for the Cal State Fullerton Titans, competing in the Big West Conference 
of NCAA Division I. He was a punter and placekicker on the Cal State Fullerton 
Titans football team.[5] He was named an All-American placekicker his freshman 
year for the Titans as he connected successfully on his first nine field 
goal attempts and finished the year with a 15-for-21 field goal percentage. 
His longest field goal of the season was 54 yards (49 m).[6] In his junior 
year, he averaged 40.9 yards (37.4 m) per punt.[7] For the Cal State Fullerton 
Titans baseball team, Nevin batted .358 with 56 runs batted in (RBI) as 
a freshman.[7] The Titans won the conference championship and reached the 
1990 College World Series (CWS) that year.[8][9] The Titans lost two games 
in the 1990 CWS, however, and were eliminated.[10] Nevin batted .335 in 
his sophomore season.[7] As a junior, he batted .391 with 20 home runs 
and 71 RBI, winning the Big West Conference Triple Crown. Collegiate Baseball 
and Baseball America named Nevin the College Player of the Year.[6][10] 
He credited his past CWS experience with allowing him to remain calm.[10] 
In three seasons at Cal State Fullerton, Nevin had a .364 average with 
39 home runs and 184 RBI.[6] He led the Titans to the finals of the 1992 
CWS, where the Titans lost to the Pepperdine Waves baseball team, which 
represented the West Coast Conference.[7] Despite the loss, Nevin was voted 
the CWS Most Outstanding Player after he batted 10-for-19 with two home 
runs and 11 RBI.[6] He also won the Golden Spikes Award, given to the best 
amateur player in the nation.[2][11] "I realize the [Houston] Astros aren't 
the Oakland A's, the New York Yankees or [Toronto] Blue Jays. I just think 
we'll settle on something fair. It won't be a record-setting deal. It will 
just be fair so I can get out and play some baseball". The Houston Astros 
chose Nevin with the first overall pick in the 1992 Major League Baseball 
draft.[5] Hal Newhouser, a scout for the Astros, had evaluated Derek Jeter 
extensively prior to the draft. Convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning 
team, Newhouser lobbied team management to select Jeter, and quit in protest 
over the Astros' decision to take Nevin instead.[13] The Astros believed 
that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1 million to forgo 
his college scholarship for a professional contract. Signing bonuses given 
to the best player in the draft were increasing rapidly. Todd Van Poppel, 
regarded by many at the time the first pick of the 1990 MLB draft, signed 
for $1.2 million, while the 1991 MLB draft's first pick, Brien Taylor, 
signed for $1.55 million after insisting he would otherwise enroll in college.[12] 
Meanwhile, the Astros were unable to sign their first-round draft pick 
in 1991, John Burke, who insisted on a bonus of $500,000 as the sixth overall 
selection.[12] Consequently, the Astros passed on Jeter in the draft.[13] 
Bill Wood, the Astros' general manager, said the team believed Nevin was 
close to a major-league level and would require little development in minor 
league baseball.[12] As evidence for this, the Astros pointed to Nevin's 
training with the wooden bats used in professional baseball in an effort 
to prepare himself for the transition from metal bats.[7] The Astros believed 
he would be a solid power hitter and have a strong work ethic. Nevin also 
did not intend to seek a signing bonus approaching those received by Van 
Poppel and Taylor.[12] The Astros decided to employ Nevin as a third baseman.[12] 
Not wanting to draw out his contract negotiations, Nevin signed with Houston 
in June, receiving a $700,000 bonus.[7][13] Nevin tried out for the United 
States national baseball team in the summer of 1990 to play in that year's 
Goodwill Games and World University Baseball Championship (WUBC). To prepare 
for those tournaments, the team played a series against Japan and a game 
in Cuba.[8] Nevin played second and third base for Team USA in 13 of its 
22 games, batting .229. The team released him before the Goodwill Games 
and WUBC as it cut players to meet the roster maximum. Nevin was also considered 
for the 1991 Pan American Games.[9] Nevin tried out for Team USA again 
before the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The team embarked on a 30-game 
tour and 38-city exhibition-game schedule in the United States before leaving 
for Spain. He made the team and served as its starting third baseman throughout 
the tournament.[6] Olympic coach Ron Fraser called Nevin an excellent player 
and student of the game.[6] The United States finished fourth out of eight 
teams in the Olympics.[14] Nevin traveled with the Astros at the end of 
their 1992 season but was not on the team's roster. The Astros sent Nevin 
to the instructional Arizona Fall League during the off-season.[6][7] Before 
the 1993 season, Baseball America ranked Nevin as the 30th-best prospect 
in baseball.[15] The Astros considered sending Nevin to the Jackson Generals 
of the Class AA Texas League to start his professional career.[6] The team 
also considered promoting him directly to the major leagues, skipping the 
minor leagues entirely. At the Astros' spring training in 1993, Nevin batted 
.350 and showed good power hitting.[2] The Astros weighed bringing Nevin 
to Houston for Opening Day as they sought to add a right-handed batter 
to complement the left-handed power of Luis Gonzalez, Steve Finley and 
Eric Anthony and make the team less vulnerable to left-handed pitching. 
But with Ken Caminiti in the first year of a three-year contract to play 
as the starting third baseman, Nevin had nowhere to play defensively. The 
Astros assigned him to the Class AAA Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast 
League, one level below the major leagues, where he made his professional 
debut.[2] While Nevin was with the Toros, the Astros asked Toros manager 
Rick Sweet to play Nevin as a left fielder, which would allow the Astros 
to promote Nevin sooner, as he and Caminiti could play different positions.[2] 
Veteran first baseman Jim Lindeman served as Nevin's mentor, helping him 
keep his composure under significant attention and pressure to perform.[2] 
Nevin started the 1993 season with a .247 batting average, but batted .309 
with baserunners in scoring position and had 49 RBI. By July, he had made 
ten starts in left field, without committing an error.[2] The Astros, however, 
were concerned that Nevin did not apply the level of intensity he had in 
"clutch" situations to cases where there were no baserunners and the score 
was not close.[2] Nevin's intensity almost got the best of him during a 
June 1993 game with Tucson.[2] He was taunted by a man seated in the front 
row, and nearly attempted to jump into the stands to confront the fan before 
he was restrained by teammates. The fan was arrested.[2] Nevin played third 
base and left field in 1993.[2] He batted .286 that season, with 10 home 
runs and 91 RBI. He had a .359 on-base percentage (OBP) and .413 slugging 
percentage (SLG).[16] Baseball America rated him the 24th best prospect 
before the 1994 season.[15] He returned to Tucson that year, posting a 
.263 batting average with 12 home runs and 71 RBI. He had a .343 OBP, and 
.393 SLG.[16] Nevin also played first base.[16] His major-league debut, 
however, was delayed both by his defense (61 errors in his first two seasons) 
and the MLB 1994–95 work stoppage.[16] "I wouldn't say that he was a disappointment. 
His attitude left something to be desired, but we don't question whether 
he has the ability to play in the big leagues. He does." The Astros traded 
Caminiti to the San Diego Padres before the 1995 season. With Caminiti 
no longer blocking his path to the major leagues, Nevin hoped he would 
be named the Astros' starting third baseman.[15] But the Astros did not 
invite him to spring training. Nevin attributed the snub to his refusal 
to work out with replacement players during the work stoppage.[17] Not 
wanting to be seen as "scabs" by the Major League Baseball Players Association, 
minor league players who felt they would play in MLB after the resolution 
of the strike felt pressure to avoid playing with replacement players, 
while career minor-leaguers were happy to get a taste of the major leagues. 
When prospects including Nevin and Billy Wagner refused to play with the 
replacement players, Astros' general manager Bob Watson issued an ultimatum, 
saying anyone who refused to play in the team's first exhibition game would 
be sent out of camp until further notice and be held in breach of contract.[18][19] 
The Astros sent Nevin back to Tucson to start the 1995 season, while Dave 
Magadan started at third base on Opening Day. The Astros also planned to 
use Shipley and Chris Donnels at third base.[20] With the Toros in 1995, 
Nevin's batting average improved to .291. He also posted a .367 OBP, and 
.463 SLG, while contributing seven home runs and 41 RBI.[16] The Astros 
promoted him on June 10, 1995,[16] and he made his major-league debut a 
day later. Nevin played 18 games for the Astros during the 1995 season.[21] 
He struggled with the Astros, however, batting .117 with no home runs, 
one RBI, a .221 OBP, and .133 SLG in 60 at-bats.[17] When he learned of 
his demotion to Tucson on July 5 in Colorado, Nevin cursed at Watson and 
Astros manager Terry Collins.[16] After Watson called for an apology,[17] 
Nevin said he would use the incident as a learning experience in controlling 
his temper.[22] The Astros acquired pitcher Mike Henneman from the Detroit 
Tigers for a player to be named later on August 10; Nevin was identified 
as the player five days later. In 1996, Nevin played in Class AA for the 
Tigers with the Jacksonville Suns of the Southern League, where he was 
converted into a catcher.[21] After the 1997 season, the Tigers traded 
Nevin and catcher Matt Walbeck to the Anaheim Angels, where Collins was 
manager, for minor league player Nick Skuse. After an injury to starting 
catcher Todd Greene, Collins gave Nevin the opportunity to compete for 
the starting job with Walbeck.[23] Nevin, by then well known for his volatile 
temper, tore off his jersey while arguing balls and strike calls with the 
home plate umpire in a 1998 game.[24] Before the 1999 season, the Angels 
traded Nevin and minor league player Keith Volkman to the San Diego Padres. 
Nevin made a late-career break with the Padres, appearing in 100 games 
for the first time during the 1999 season. He then had the best offensive 
years of his career: he hit 31 home runs with a .916 on-base plus slugging 
(OPS) during the 2000 season. He was named to the National League All-Star 
team in 2001, when he hit 41 home runs with 126 RBI and had a .976 OPS. 
He also led major-league third basemen in errors, however, with 27, and 
had the lowest fielding percentage of all major league third basemen (.930).[25] 
Nevin in 2002 played first base, which was considered his strongest defensive 
position.[26] But injuries shortened his 2002 and 2003 seasons. In 2002, 
he missed time with a strained left elbow. Three games after returning 
from the elbow injury, he broke his arm diving for a ground ball, causing 
him to miss another six weeks.[27] After being heckled by a fan during 
a September 2002 game, Nevin gave the fan the finger, for which he apologized.[28] 
Nevin suffered a dislocated shoulder in spring training in 2003 while making 
a diving catch.[29] He had surgery on his left shoulder and returned to 
the Padres in June.[30] The Padres acquired Rondell White to replace Nevin, 
and White went on to have an All-Star season in left field. Ryan Klesko 
filled in at first base and rookie Sean Burroughs played well at third 
base, Nevin's favorite position. Nevin offered to be used in a utility 
role, alternating with White, Klesko, and Burroughs, as well as Xavier 
Nady in right field.[26] In 2004, Nevin had more than 100 RBI for the third 
time in his career, but underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage 
in his right knee in July.[31] Nevin was often frustrated with the dimensions 
of Petco Park. He hit a double during a 2004 game that he believed would 
have been a home run in other stadiums; when he reached second base, he 
pointed toward Padres' general manager Kevin Towers' suite and threw down 
his helmet, resulting in a postgame argument.[32] Towers said the two had 
a "love-hate" relationship.[24] "I've had a heckuva lot of ups and downs, 
and this obviously isn't one of the up times." Two nights after San Diego 
Padres management informed Nevin that Xavier Nady would replace him as 
the starting first baseman, Nevin rejected a trade to the Baltimore Orioles 
for Sidney Ponson on July 25, 2005.[33] Nevin exercised a clause in his 
contract that gave him the right to block transactions that would send 
him to any of eight franchises, one of which was the Orioles.[34] He was 
instead traded on July 30, a day before the non-waiver trade deadline, 
to the Texas Rangers for Chan Ho Park, whose salary the Rangers wanted 
to dump.[33][35] In his first thirteen games with the Rangers, the team 
posted a 1–12 record as Nevin batted 5-for-44. That put his season batting 
average under .200, known as the "Mendoza Line". The Rangers benched Nevin 
in September, giving his starts to prospect first baseman Adrian Gonzalez 
after the team was eliminated from playoff contention.[33] In his first 
game back in the lineup on September 24, his average dropped to .182. He 
refuted opinions that he was losing bat speed.[33] Nevin had one year remaining 
on a contract worth $9 million. Manager Buck Showalter said that despite 
Nevin's benching at the end of the 2005 season, he was his starting designated 
hitter for the 2006 season.[33] Despite hopes that help from renowned hitting 
coach Rudy Jaramillo and the hitter-friendly Ameriquest Field would increase 
Nevin's offensive production in 2006, he continued to struggle.[33] He 
batted .216 with nine home runs and 31 RBI in 46 games. The Rangers promoted 
rookie Jason Botts on May 23, and Botts began to receive Nevin's playing 
time.[36] Nevin had only two hits in his last 32 at-bats with the Rangers, 
though both of them were home runs.[36] The Chicago Cubs sought a slugging 
first baseman to replace the injured Derrek Lee, and the Rangers traded 
Nevin to Chicago on May 31, 2006. The Rangers received second baseman and 
outfielder Jerry Hairston, Jr. in return. The Rangers also agreed to pay 
the difference in the two players' salaries.[36] On August 31, the deadline 
for trades of players who had cleared waivers, the Cubs traded Nevin to 
the Twins for cash and a player to be named later. To make room for Nevin, 
Twins' outfielder Shannon Stewart was placed on the 60-day disabled list.[37] 
With the Twins, Nevin stopped worrying about his statistics and enjoyed 
playing in a pennant race.[38] Nevin appeared in the MLB postseason for 
the first time in his career with the Twins in 2006.[21][38] The Twins 
were swept by the Oakland Athletics in three games; Nevin appeared in one 
of the three games, batting 0-for-3.[39][40] Unsigned at the beginning 
of the following season, Nevin announced his retirement on May 12, 2007.[41] 
During his twelve-season career, Nevin had a .270 batting average with 
208 home runs and 743 RBI in 1,217 games.[21] After retiring, Nevin joined 
the Padres' pre-game radio show.[41] He also joined ESPN as an analyst 
for the college baseball regionals during the College World Series.[41] 
Two seasons removed from his playing career, Nevin decided to return to 
baseball as a manager in 2008.[24] That December, he was named the manager 
of the Orange County Flyers in the independent Golden Baseball League (GBL). 
The Flyers finished with a 37–39 record in 2009, fourth in the five-team 
GBL.[42] Nevin planned to return to the Flyers in 2010, but a chance meeting 
at baseball's winter meetings led to Nevin's hiring as manager of the Erie 
SeaWolves, the Class-AA minor-league affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.[24] 
He replaced the previous manager, Tom Brookens after Brookens was promoted 
to the Tigers' major-league first-base coach.[42][43] Nevin managed the 
SeaWolves for one season. On November 11, 2010, Nevin was named manager 
of the Toledo Mud Hens, the Tigers' Class AAA minor league affiliate. He 
is considered a potential future MLB manager.[24] Catcher Omir Santos described 
his managing the Mud Hens as "like having a big league manager in [Class 
AAA]."[24] On August 31, 2013, Nevin was fired after the team's final home 
game of the season. Nevin's record as manager was 192–238; the team never 
finished higher than third in the International League's West division.[44] 
The Arizona Diamondbacks named Nevin as manager of the Reno Aces, their 
Class AAA affiliate, for the 2014 season.[45] In his first season with 
Reno, he guided the Aces to a Pacific Coast League-best 81-63 record and 
an eventual Pacific Coast League Championship Series berth. After the season, 
the Astros interviewed Nevin for their open managerial position.[46] However 
Nevin remained the manager of the Reno Aces for the 2015 season and returned 
as manager in 2016. He was appointed to Bochy's Giants' staff on November 
7, 2016, to succeed former third-base coach Roberto Kelly. Nevin's first 
daughter, Koral, was born during his freshman year at Cal State Fullerton; 
he is no longer in a relationship with Koral's mother.[6] He met his wife, 
Kristin, at Cal State Fullerton. The couple have two children together; 
though they were separated during the late 1990s, the couple reconciled.[47][48] 
His son, Tyler Nevin, was drafted by the Colorado Rockies as the 38th pick 
in the 2015 MLB draft.[49][50][51] Nevin lives in the Heritage Estates 
neighborhood of Poway, California, along with San Diego sporting figures 
including Bruce Bochy and LaDainian Tomlinson. The neighborhood suffered 
significant damage in the October 2007 California wildfires.[52] Nevin
