Patrick Edward Dobson, Jr. (February 12, 1942 – November 22, 2006) was 
an American right-handed starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who 
played for the Detroit Tigers (1967–69), San Diego Padres (1970), Baltimore 
Orioles (1971–72), Atlanta Braves (1973), New York Yankees (1973–75) and 
Cleveland Indians (1976–77). He was best known for being one of four Orioles 
pitchers to win 20 games in their 1971 season. Born in Depew, New York 
in 1942, Dobson signed with Detroit in 1959. After spending seven years 
in the minor leagues and winter ball, pitching both in relief and starting,[1] 
he made his debut with the big team in the 1967 season after starting the 
season 4-1 with a 1.47 ERA in six starts for the AAA Toledo Mud Hens. Dobson 
would spend the next 2 1/2 years as a reliever and spot starter for the 
Tigers including pitching 4 2/3 innings of relief in the team's 1968 World 
Series victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.[2] Unable to claim a spot 
in the Tigers' rotation of Mickey Lolich, Denny McLain, Earl Wilson, and 
Joe Sparma, Dobson was traded to San Diego in 1969 along with Dave Campbell 
for a young Joe Niekro.[3] After going 14-15 with 185 strikeouts and a 
3.76 earned run average as the staff ace for the last-place Padres, he 
was traded to Baltimore on December 1 as part of a six-player swap.[4] 
In 1971 Dobson had a winning streak of 12 games (including nine consecutive 
complete games) and a scoreless inning streak of 23. On September 24, he 
recorded his 20th win, a 7–0 shutout against the Indians. Dobson posted 
a 20-8, 187, 2.90 season record, and was part of the Orioles' "Big Four" 
pitching staff along with Dave McNally (21-5), Mike Cuellar (20-9), and 
Jim Palmer (20-10). Baltimore went on to win 101 games, with the distinction 
of having four 20-game winners in a season; only one other team in MLB 
history, the 1920 Chicago White Sox, have had four 20-game winners. On 
November 2, 1971, Dobson threw a 2-0 no-hitter against the Yomiuri Giants 
in Tokyo. It was the first no-hit game in the Japanese-American baseball 
exhibition history. Dobson was an All-Star in 1972. His 2.65 ERA was a 
major improvement from his 20-win season, but he went 16-18, tying for 
the AL lead in losses with Yankee Mel Stottlemyre. On November 30, 1972, 
he was traded to the Braves along with Davey Johnson in a five-player trade 
for Earl Williams. After starting the 1973 season 3-7, Dobson was sent 
to the Yankees on June 7 for four minor league players (none of whom panned 
out). Escaping Atlanta, he again blossomed and finished the season with 
a 9-8 record for the Yankees. Dobson started the 1974 campaign weakly, 
achieving only a 6-11 record by mid-season. However, Dobson anchored the 
Yankees' pitching staff in the second half of the season, finishing with 
a 19-15 record and a 3.07 ERA, the best numbers that year for a Yankee 
pitcher. After a slumping 11-14, 4.07 in 1975, Dobson was traded to the 
Indians, and recovered in 1976 with a 16-12, 3.48. After his 3-12, 6.16 
record in 1977, he finished his career. In his 11-season career Dobson 
had a record of 122-129, with 1,301 strikeouts, a 3.54 earned run average, 
74 complete games, 14 shutouts, 19 saves, and 2,120 ⅓ innings pitched in 
414 games. After his playing days, Dobson became a respected pitching coach 
with the Brewers, Padres, Royals, and Orioles. From 1989 to 1990, he was 
the manager of the Fort Myers Sun Sox of the Senior Professional Baseball 
Association, leading the team to a 37-35 record and a playoff berth in 
his first season and an 11-14 record at the time of the league's demise 
on December 26, 1990. In 1997, Dobson joined the San Francisco Giants organization 
and worked as an advance major league scout and assistant to general manager 
Brian Sabean.[4] Dobson died from leukemia in 2006 in San Diego, California 
at the age of 64, one day after being diagnosed with the disease.[4] He 
is survived by six children (Patrick Dobson III, Nancy Dobson Kost, Stacy 
Dobson, Christopher Dobson, Shannon Christaldi-Dobson, and Stephanie Dobson)
