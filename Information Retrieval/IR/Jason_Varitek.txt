Jason Andrew Varitek (/ˈværᵻtɛk/; born April 11, 1972), nicknamed "Tek", 
is a retired American baseball catcher. After being traded as a minor league 
prospect by the Seattle Mariners, Varitek played his entire major league 
career for the Boston Red Sox, for whom he now works as a special assistant. 
A three-time All-Star and Gold Glove Award winner at catcher, as well as 
a Silver Slugger Award winner, Varitek was part of both the 2004 World 
Series and 2007 World Series Championship teams, and was viewed widely 
as one of the team's leaders. In December 2004 he was named the captain 
of the Red Sox, only their fourth captain since 1923.[1] He was a switch-hitter.[2] 
Varitek is one of only three players, along with pitcher Ed Vosberg and 
outfielder Michael Conforto,[3] to have played in the Little League World 
Series, College World Series, and Major League World Series. He additionally 
participated in Olympic Baseball and the World Baseball Classic. His Lake 
Brantley High School baseball team won the Florida State Championship his 
senior year in 1990 and was named the number one high school baseball team 
in the nation by a USA Today poll.[4] Varitek caught an MLB-record four 
no-hitters, a record which was later tied by Carlos Ruiz.[5][6] Varitek 
played in the 1984 Little League World Series, leading his Altamonte Springs, 
Florida team to victory in the United States Championship bracket in a 
4–2 victory over Southport, Indiana. Jason was Lake Brantley High School's 
third baseman and relief catcher. Brantley's first line catcher was Jerry 
Thurston, himself a pro prospect. In 1990, the Patriots won the state championship.[7] 
He was also a member of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team and won the Dick Howser 
Trophy for National Collegiate Player of the Year. Varitek was drafted 
in the 23rd round of the 1990 amateur draft by the Houston Astros, but 
opted to attend college instead of pursuing professional baseball at that 
time.[8] Varitek attended Georgia Tech, where he helped lead the Yellow 
Jackets baseball team to the 1994 College World Series title game, along 
with teammates Nomar Garciaparra and Jay Payton (they would lose to the 
University of Oklahoma). He was also named Baseball America's 1993 College 
Player of the Year. Varitek graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in 
management and is the only Tech baseball player to have his number (33) 
retired. Varitek played five summers in the Cape Cod Baseball League with 
the Hyannis Mets. In 1993, he hit .371 while winning both the league batting 
championship and MVP. He was drafted 21st overall in the first round by 
the Minnesota Twins in 1993,[9] but opted to return for his senior year 
of college. Following graduation, Varitek signed with agent Scott Boras 
and was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the first round of the 1994 
amateur draft, with the 14th pick overall.[10] A pioneer of the loopholes 
in the draft process, Varitek signed with the St. Paul Saints in the independent 
Northern League[11] before agreeing to terms with the Mariners, and consequently 
did not enter the Mariners' minor league system until 1995. When he finally 
did join the franchise, Varitek was sent to the AA affiliate Port City 
Roosters where he first met pitcher and longtime teammate Derek Lowe. He 
was traded with Lowe to the Red Sox during the 1997 season in return for 
reliever Heathcliff Slocumb, often cited as one of the best trades in the 
Red Sox's favor in recent history.[12] Varitek was called up for a single 
game on September 24, 1997, collecting a single in his only at bat. During 
the 1998 season, Varitek split time with incumbent catcher Scott Hatteberg 
playing in 86 games.[2] Varitek showed signs of things to come in the season, 
and with a strong spring training following the season, Varitek earned 
the starting catcher position. 1999 was a breakout year for the catcher. 
Varitek played in 144 games, hitting for a .269 average, with 20 home runs 
and 76 RBIs.[13] Varitek went 5–21 with 3 RBI in the 1999 ALDS against 
the Cleveland Indians[2] and 4–20 with 1 RBI in the ALCS against the New 
York Yankees.[2] Looking forward on building more success from the year 
before, the 2000 season was a disappointment offensively, producing a .248 
average with only 10 home runs and 65 RBI, as the Red Sox failed to qualify 
for post-season play.[2] Prior to the 2001 season, Varitek signed a 3-year, 
$14.9 million contract with Boston. Varitek went on a hitting hot streak, 
having a .310 average at one point and on May 20, 2001, he homered three 
times in a single game before a broken left elbow injury sidelined the 
catcher for nearly the rest of the season, as Varitek dove to catch a foul 
ball on June 7. The play went on to be a top Web Gem for the month of July 
in 2001. Varitek finished the season with a .293 average, 7 home runs, 
and 25 RBI in 51 games played.[2] Varitek returned to the Red Sox lineup 
full-time in the 2002 season. The return did not go smoothly, however, 
as Varitek struggled to find himself at the plate. Despite not reaching 
his full offensive potential,[2] pitchers and coaches alike began to notice 
how much Varitek's preparation and knowledge of the game was helping the 
pitchers. His study habits and extra hours of work with pitchers would 
soon become his defining attribute. Varitek and the Red Sox entered the 
2003 season with a renewed fire to reach the playoffs after missing in 
the previous three years. Varitek instantly became a leader in the clubhouse 
which management tried to portray as working class, featuring new faces 
such as Kevin Millar, David Ortiz, Bill Mueller, and Todd Walker along 
with original players Trot Nixon and Lou Merloni. 2003 was Varitek's best 
year to date and earned his first All-Star selection after the fans voted 
him on with the All-Star Final Vote. He was hitting .296 with 15 HRs and 
51 RBIs[14] going into the all-star break and finished the season off with 
a solid .273 average, 25 HRs and 85 RBIs,[2] all career highs. The Red 
Sox earned a Wild Card berth and their first playoff appearance since 1999, 
before losing the 2003 ALCS to the New York Yankees. In 2004, Varitek compiled 
a career-high .296 batting average with 18 home runs and 73 RBI. During 
a nationally televised game on July 24, 2004, Varitek shoved his glove 
into the face of the Yankees' Alex Rodriguez after Rodriguez was hit by 
a pitch and gestured towards pitcher Bronson Arroyo, causing a bench-clearing 
brawl. Though he was ejected (along with Rodriguez) from the game following 
the incident, the Red Sox, spurred on by the fight, came from behind to 
win 11–10. It is also sometimes regarded as the turning point in the Red 
Sox season, as they posted MLB's best record after the melee. Boston culminated 
the season with its first World Series championship in 86 years, after 
being the first team to overcome a three games to none deficit in the ALCS 
vs. the New York Yankees. At the end of the year, Varitek became a free 
agent and signed a 4-year, $40-million contract with the Red Sox.[15] Because 
of his performance both on and off the field, the franchise awarded Varitek 
with the captaincy. After Varitek's re-signing, the Red Sox appointed him 
to be the third team captain in franchise history, following hall of famers 
Carl Yastrzemski (1969–1983) and Jim Rice (1986–1989).[15] He became one 
of the three captains in Major League Baseball. Derek Jeter of the NY Yankees, 
and Paul Konerko of the Chicago White Sox were the others. He maintained 
his captaincy until his retirement before the 2012 season. In 2005, Varitek 
won his first Gold Glove Award, his first Silver Slugger, and his second 
All-Star selection. In 2006, Varitek represented the United States in the 
World Baseball Classic, playing in three games. He made the most of his 
playing time, hitting a grand slam against Team Canada allowing Team USA 
to narrow an 8–2 lead down to 8–6. Team Canada, however, kept the lead 
in the upset victory. On July 18, 2006, Varitek played his 991st game at 
catcher for the Boston Red Sox, breaking Carlton Fisk's club record. That 
game was a home game vs. Kansas City, during which Varitek's achievement 
was recognized before the bottom of the 5th inning (after the game was 
official and couldn't be cancelled due to weather). Varitek received a 
standing ovation from the sellout crowd at Fenway Park for a few moments 
before play resumed. On July 31, 2006, Varitek was injured rounding the 
bases in a 9–8 victory over the Cleveland Indians (his 1000th career game 
as catcher), but said he believed the initial injury to the knee occurred 
while he was blocking home plate to make the tag against the Angels Mike 
Napoli on July 29, 2006. He had surgery on August 3, 2006, to repair torn 
cartilage in his left knee. Varitek returned to the Red Sox lineup on September 
4, following a short rehabilitation assignment in Pawtucket. On September 
19, 2006, Varitek was honored during a pre-game ceremony as the first Red 
Sox catcher to catch 1,000 games. He was presented with a special award 
by Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk, who held the Boston club record with 990 
career games caught before Varitek surpassed it. Varitek caught his 1000th 
game on July 31 and by the evening of the ceremony had appeared in 1,009 
games behind the plate. That same night, Varitek also received the 2006 
Red Sox Heart and Hustle Award from the local chapter of the Major League 
Baseball Players Alumni Association, which is presented to a player exemplifying 
the values, tradition, and spirit of the game of baseball. In 2007, Varitek 
and the Red Sox returned to the World Series, winning for the second time 
in four years. During the season, Varitek recorded his 1000th career hit. 
On May 19, 2008, he caught Jon Lester's no-hitter, giving him a Major League 
record of having caught four separate no-hitters in his career. In honor 
of being captain, Varitek released Captain Cabernet, a charity wine with 
proceeds benefiting Pitching In For Kids and Children's Hospital Boston.[16][17] 
At the end of the 2008 season, Varitek opted for free agency, rejecting 
arbitration that would give him a salary close to the $10 million he made 
in 2008.[18] Reports in the Boston Globe suggested that his agent, Scott 
Boras, was using New York Yankee catcher Jorge Posada's four-year, $52.4 
million deal as a benchmark for negotiations.[19] On February 6, 2009, 
Varitek signed a new one-year deal with the Red Sox worth $5 million with 
a $5 million club option, or a $3 million player option, for 2010.[12][20] 
During the 2009 season, Varitek's numbers were similar to his dismal 2008 
season, with slightly more home runs (14), doubles (24) and runs batted 
in (51), and a higher slugging percentage (.390) despite a lower batting 
average (.209) and fewer at bats (425). He eventually became the backup 
catcher when the Red Sox acquired All-Star Victor Martinez on the July 
31 trade deadline. On December 2, 2010, Sports Illustrated, on its website 
SI.com, reported that Jason Varitek signed a one-year, two-million dollar 
deal to stay with the Boston Red Sox for the 2011 season.[21] The deal 
was finalized on December 10.[22] With the addition of Jarrod Saltalamacchia, 
Varitek usually came off the bench during the 2011 season, playing in 68 
games, hitting .221 with 11 home runs, 36 RBI, with a .300 on-base percentage 
After the 2011 season, Varitek became a free agent once again, and was 
offered a minor league contract, with an invitation to spring training, 
by the Red Sox. On March 1, 2012, at Jet Blue Park in Fort Myers, Florida, 
Varitek officially announced his retirement. On September 27, 2012, Red 
Sox General Manager Ben Cherington announced that Varitek had been named 
special assistant to the general manager.[23][24] In that role, Cherington 
said Varitek would be involved in areas such as "major league personnel 
decisions, evaluations, and mentorship and instruction of young players."[24] 
Varitek is currently a special assistant to Dave Dombrowski, president 
of baseball operations.[25] Varitek has three daughters from his previous 
marriage, Alexandra, Kendall and Caroline. He and his first wife Karen 
Mullinax, divorced in 2008. He married Catherine Panagiotopoulos on November 
26, 2011[32] and their first child, Liv Jordan Varitek, was born on May
