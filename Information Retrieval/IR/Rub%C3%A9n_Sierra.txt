Rubén Angel Sierra García (born October 6, 1965) is a former Major League 
Baseball outfielder. Sierra goes by the nicknames El Caballo and El Indio. 
Over 20 seasons, Sierra played for the Texas Rangers (1986–92, 2000–01, 
2003), Oakland Athletics (1992–95), New York Yankees (1995–96, 2003–05), 
Detroit Tigers (1996), Cincinnati Reds (1997), Toronto Blue Jays (1997), 
Chicago White Sox (1998), Seattle Mariners (2002), Minnesota Twins (2006). 
Sierra graduated from Liceo Interamericano Castro High School in Puerto 
Rico in 1983, where he played baseball, basketball and volleyball. In November 
1982, the Texas Rangers signed 17-year-old Sierra out of Puerto Rico.[1] 
Sierra made his major league debut on June 1, 1986 as an outfielder and 
hit a home run in just his second MLB at bat becoming the first Texas Rangers 
player to accomplish this feat.[2] Sierra had a decent rookie year hitting 
.264 with 16 home runs and 55 RBIs. In 1989, Sierra hit 29 home runs, and 
led the league in RBIs (119), slugging (.543), and extra bases (78).[3] 
Despite superior numbers, he finished second in MVP voting to Robin Yount, 
who was a superior defender on a better team. He went on to have 3 years 
with 100+ RBIs with the Rangers.[4] In August 1992, the Rangers traded 
Sierra to the Oakland Athletics for José Canseco.[5] He later played more 
years with the Rangers. In 1995, the A's traded Sierra to the New York 
Yankees for Danny Tartabull.[6] After helping the Yankees reach the playoffs 
for the first time in 14 years in 1995, Sierra was traded to the Detroit 
Tigers with Matt Drews for Cecil Fielder.[7] Sierra was considered a journeyman 
because of playing for numerous teams during the late-1990s, including 
the Reds, Blue Jays, and White Sox. After making a comeback with the Rangers 
in late 2000, he would go on to achieve moderate success with the Rangers 
in 2001, winning AL Comeback Player of the Year, and Mariners in 2002. 
In 2003, during Sierra's third stint with the Rangers, he was traded back 
to the Yankees, who were looking for a power-hitter off the bench. Sierra 
was an important part of the 2004 Yankees, a team that hit over 240 home 
runs. Sierra himself slugged 17 of those homers as the usual designated 
hitter, playing in 56 games at the position.[8] In Game 4 of the 2004 American 
League Division Series, with the Yankees down to the Minnesota Twins 5–2, 
Sierra hit a 3-run home run to tie the game at 5–5 off of reliever Juan 
Rincón.[9] His clutch home run helped the Yankees rally to win the game 
and the series. However, he was the final out of Game 7 of the 2004 American 
League Championship Series, hitting a ground ball to Pokey Reese, which 
secured the dramatic comeback victory of the Boston Red Sox. Sierra had 
an injury plagued 2005 season and was let go by the Yankees after hitting 
just 4 home runs.[10] In 2006, Sierra signed a minor league contract with 
the Minnesota Twins, but was released on July 10.[11] In August, Sierra 
was offered a chance to sign on with the New York Mets for the September 
run and playoffs. However, due to family issues (illness to his mother), 
he opted not to play again in 2006. In January 2007, Sierra signed a minor 
league contract with the Mets, who invited him to Spring training. However, 
on March 20, he requested, and was granted, his release by the team after
