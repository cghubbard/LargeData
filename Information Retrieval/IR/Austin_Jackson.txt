Austin Jarrell Jackson (born February 1, 1987) is an American professional 
baseball center fielder who is a free agent. He has played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers, Seattle Mariners, Chicago Cubs and 
Chicago White Sox. In 1999, Baseball America named Jackson the best 12-year-old 
baseball player in the nation, and the best 15-year-old baseball player 
three years later.[1] Jackson attended Billy Ryan High School in Denton, 
Texas.[2] In basketball, he was listed as the #10-ranked high school point 
guard in the country by Athlon Sports after he averaged 22.5 points, five 
rebounds and three assists per game his junior year in high school. In 
baseball he hit .423 with five homers and 34 RBI for his class AAAA Texas 
State runner-up baseball team and was rated the No. 14 draft prospect among 
high school players in the nation by Baseball America.[3] Though Jackson 
committed to play both baseball and basketball for Georgia Tech, the New 
York Yankees drafted Jackson in the eighth round (259th overall) in the 
2005 Major League Baseball draft. To convince him to sign instead of attending 
Georgia Tech, the Yankees offered Jackson $800,000, a record signing bonus 
for an eighth round pick.[1] From 2005 to 2009 Jackson rose up the Yankees 
organization and after a slow start, he became a top prospect for the Yankees.[4] 
For the 2009 season he was the Yankees top prospect according to Baseball 
America.[5] After the 2009 season, Jackson was added to the 40-man roster 
to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.[6] On December 9, 2009 Jackson was 
traded to the Detroit Tigers as part of a three-team trade that brought 
Curtis Granderson to the Yankees.[7] Jackson entered the 2010 season as 
the Tigers third-best prospect, according to Baseball America.[8] Jackson 
made his major league debut on April 5, 2010, against the Kansas City Royals, 
going one for five. He hit his first major league home run on April 25, 
2010, off of Colby Lewis of the Texas Rangers.[9] Through the first month 
of the season Jackson led the majors in hits with 36, and was named the 
AL Rookie of the Month.[10] On June 2, 2010, against the Cleveland Indians, 
Jackson made a difficult running catch in the ninth inning of Armando Galarraga's 
near-perfect game. The perfect game eventually ended with two outs in the 
ninth after a blown call by umpire Jim Joyce.[11] He was named an outfielder 
on Baseball America's 2010 All-Rookie Team.[12] He was also named an outfielder 
on the 2010 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team.[13] On November 15, 
2010, Jackson came in second in the 2010 American League Rookie of the 
Year voting, behind Rangers closer Neftalí Feliz.[14][15] Jackson finished 
his rookie season by playing 151 games with a .293 batting average, 10 
triples, 4 home runs, 41 RBI, and an AL-leading 170 strikeouts. Jackson 
was named the American League Player of the Week for the week of August 
29 to September 4, 2011. In receiving the award for the first time, Jackson 
had a .529 batting average (18 for 34) during the week with three doubles, 
three triples, two home runs, five runs batted in, and 13 runs scored. 
The Tigers went 5–2 that week to increase their lead in the American League 
Central Division.[16] He won a Fielding Bible Award in 2011 as the best 
fielding center fielder in MLB.[17] Jackson played 153 games in 2011 batting 
.249 with 10 home runs, 45 RBI, an AL-leading 11 triples, and 181 strikeouts. 
In Game 6 of the 2011 ALCS, Jackson hit his first career postseason home 
run. The Tigers would however lose the game and the series to the Texas 
Rangers. On April 5, 2012, Jackson was the leadoff hitter and played center 
field on Opening Day for the Tigers, where he went 3-5 with an RBI and 
a run. Jackson hit a walk-off, bases-loaded single down the third base 
line to give the Tigers the win over the Red Sox, 3-2.[18] Jackson played 
137 games in 2012, batting .300 with 16 home runs, 66 RBI, and an AL-leading 
10 triples. Jackson went to the postseason with the Tigers for a second 
straight season, and he hit a home run in the series-clinching Game 4 against 
the New York Yankees in the ALCS. But the Tigers eventually got swept in 
4 games by the San Francisco Giants in the World Series. Injuries limited 
Jackson to 129 games in 2013. Serving as the Tigers leadoff hitter again, 
he batted .272 with 12 home runs, 49 RBIs, and a career-low 8 stolen bases. 
On January 17, 2014, Jackson and the Tigers avoided arbitration by agreeing 
to a one-year deal for the 2014 season worth $6 million.[19] On July 31, 
2014, the Tigers traded Jackson to the Seattle Mariners in a three-team 
deal that sent Drew Smyly, Nick Franklin and Willy Adames to the Tampa 
Bay Rays, and David Price to the Detroit Tigers.[20] On May 3, 2015, Jackson 
sprained his ankle in a game against the Houston Astros, and was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list the following day.[21] On August 31, 2015, 
the Mariners traded Jackson to the Chicago Cubs for a player to be named 
later and an international signing bonus slot.[22] Jackson ended the 2015 
season having played 136 games, stealing 17 bases with a .696 OPS. On March 
6, 2016, Jackson signed a one-year, $5 million deal with the Chicago White 
Sox.[23] On August 25th, 2016 White Sox GM Rick Hahn told the media that 
Jackson would miss the rest of the season after being out since June 10th. 
He had surgery to repair a medical meniscus tear in his left knee. He finished
