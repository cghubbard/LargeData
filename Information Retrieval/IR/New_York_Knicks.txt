The New York Knickerbockers,[1] commonly referred to as the Knicks, are 
an American professional basketball team based in New York City. The Knicks 
compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member club of 
the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home 
games at Madison Square Garden, located in the borough of Manhattan. They 
are one of two NBA teams located in New York City; the other is the Brooklyn 
Nets. The team, established by Ned Irish in 1946, was one of the founding 
members of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which became the 
NBA after merging with the rival National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949. 
Along with the Boston Celtics, the Knicks are one of only two original 
NBA teams still located in its original city. The Knicks were successful 
during their early years and were constant playoff contenders under the 
franchise's first head coach Joe Lapchick. Beginning in 1950, the Knicks 
made three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, all of which were 
losing efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the team subsequently began 
to falter. It was not until the late 1960s when Red Holzman became head 
coach that the Knicks began to regain their former dominance. Holzman successfully 
guided the Knicks to two NBA championships, in 1970 and 1973. The Knicks 
of the 1980s had mixed success that included six playoff appearances; however, 
they failed to participate in the NBA Finals. The playoff-level Knicks 
of the 1990s were led by future Hall of Fame center Patrick Ewing; this 
era was marked by passionate rivalries with the Chicago Bulls, Indiana 
Pacers, and Miami Heat. During this time, they were known for playing tough 
defense under head coaches Pat Riley and Jeff Van Gundy. During this era, 
the Knicks made two appearances in the NBA Finals, in 1994 and 1999, though 
they were unable to win an NBA championship. Since 2000, the Knicks have 
struggled to regain their former glory. In 2012–13, the franchise won its 
first division title in 19 years, but was eliminated in the second round 
of the playoffs by the Indiana Pacers. According to a 2016 Forbes report, 
the Knicks were the most-valuable NBA franchise, worth approximately $3 
billion.[4] In 1946, basketball, particularly college basketball, was a 
growing and increasingly profitable sport in New York City.[5] Hockey was 
another popular sport at the time and generated considerable profits; however, 
the arenas were not used often.[6] Max Kase, a New York sportswriter, became 
the sports editor at the Boston American in the 1930s, when he met Boston 
Garden owner Walter A. Brown.[7] Kase developed the idea of an organized 
professional league to showcase college players upon their graduation and 
felt it could become profitable if properly assembled.[7] Brown, intrigued 
by the opportunity to attain additional income when the hockey teams were 
not playing or on the road, contacted several arena owners.[7] On June 
6, 1946, Kase and Brown and a group of seventeen others assembled at the 
Commodore Hotel in New York City, as the Basketball Association of America 
(BAA), where charter franchises were granted to major cities throughout 
the country.[8] Ned Irish, a college basketball promoter, retired sportswriter 
and then president of Madison Square Garden, was in attendance.[7][9] Kase 
originally planned to own and operate the New York franchise himself and 
approached Irish with a proposal to lease the Garden.[7] Irish explained 
that the rules of the Arena Managers Association of America stated that 
Madison Square Garden was required to own any professional teams that played 
in the arena.[7] On the day of the meeting, Kase made his proposal to the 
panel of owners; however, they were much more impressed by Irish and his 
vast resources; Kase relented and the franchise was awarded to Irish.[7] 
Irish wanted a distinct name for his franchise that was representative 
of the city of New York.[10] He called together members of his staff for 
a meeting to cast their votes in a hat. After tallying the votes, the franchise 
was named the Knickerbockers.[10] The "Knickerbocker" name comes from the 
pseudonym used by Washington Irving in his book A History of New York, 
a name which became applied to the descendants of the original Dutch settlers 
of what later became New York, and later, by extension, to New Yorkers 
in general.[1] In search of a head coach, Irish approached successful St. 
John's University coach Joe Lapchick in May 1946.[10] Lapchick readily 
accepted after Irish promised to make him the highest paid coach in the 
league; however, he requested he remain at St. John's one more season in 
hopes of winning one last championship.[11] Irish obliged, hiring former 
Manhattan College coach Neil Cohalan as interim coach for the first year.[11] 
With no college draft in the league's initial year, there was no guarantee 
that the Knicks or the league itself would thrive.[12] Consequently, teams 
focused on signing college players from their respective cities as a way 
to promote the professional league.[11] The Knicks held their first training 
camp in the Catskill Mountains at the Nevele Country Club.[13] Twenty-five 
players were invited to attend the three-week session.[13] Players worked 
out twice a day and the chemistry between the New York natives was instant.[14] 
With a roster assembled, the Knicks faced the Toronto Huskies at Toronto's 
Maple Leaf Gardens on November 1, 1946, in what would be the franchise's 
first game—as well as the first in league history.[13] In a low-scoring 
affair presented in front of 7,090 spectators, the Knicks defeated the 
Huskies 68–66 with Leo Gottlieb leading the Knicks in scoring with 14 points.[15] 
With Madison Square Garden's crowded schedule, the Knicks were forced to 
play many of their home games at the 69th Regiment Armory during the team's 
early years.[9] The Knicks went on to finish their inaugural campaign with 
a 33–27 record and achieved a playoff berth under Cohalan despite a dismal 
shooting percentage of 28 percent.[12] The Knicks faced the Cleveland Rebels 
in the quarterfinals, winning the series 2–1.[16] However, the Knicks were 
swept by the Philadelphia Warriors in two games in the semifinals.[16] 
As promised, Lapchick took over in 1947, bringing with him his up-tempo 
coaching style, which emphasized fast ball movement.[17] Six new players 
were signed, including guard Carl Braun[16] and Japanese American guard 
Wataru Misaka, the first non-Caucasian professional basketball player.[18] 
Under Lapchick, the Knicks made nine straight playoff appearances beginning 
in 1947.[19] Braun, who averaged 14.3 points, emerged as the team's star 
and paired with Dick Holub and Bud Palmer to account for half of the team's 
offense.[16] Despite this, the Knicks struggled throughout the year, compiling 
a 26–22 record.[16] Their finish was good enough to place them second in 
the Eastern Division and secure a playoff match-up against the Baltimore 
Bullets where they lost the series two games to one.[16] In the 1948 NBA 
draft, the Knicks selected two future Hall of Fame players in center Dolph 
Schayes and Harry Gallatin.[20] The Knicks were leery of Schayes' talent, 
prompting the center to leave to play for the Syracuse Nationals of the 
struggling National Basketball League.[20] Despite losing Schayes, the 
team started the year well going 17–8 before they fell into a slump.[21] 
They ended the year with a seven-game win streak to finish with a 32–28 
record and a third-straight playoff appearance.[21] The Knicks defeated 
the Bullets in a rematch of their previous encounter in 1947, winning the 
series 2–1.[21] The team however struggled against the Washington Capitols 
and lost the series 1–2.[21] Prior to the beginning of the 1949–50 season, 
the BAA merged with the National Basketball League to form the National 
Basketball Association with the BAA absorbing six teams from its former 
competitor.[19] Despite division realignments, the Knicks remained in the 
Eastern Division.[19] The team continued its dominance under Lapchick, 
winning 40 games; however they lost the Eastern Division finals to the 
Syracuse Nationals.[19] The following season, the Knicks made history signing 
Sweetwater Clifton to a contract, thus becoming the first professional 
basketball team to sign an African American player.[19] During this same 
season, the Knicks finished with a 36–30 record. Though they placed third 
in their division, they secured a playoff spot and began the first of three 
consecutive trips to the NBA Finals.[19] In spite of their success, the 
Knicks could not overcome the Rochester Royals despite a valiant comeback 
after losing the first three games of the Finals.[19] The next two years, 
in 1952 and 1953, New York fell to the Minneapolis Lakers in the Finals.[19] 
It was during this early period, the Knicks developed their first standout 
players in Carl Braun who retired as the Knicks leading scorer with 10,449 
points before later being surpassed by the likes of Patrick Ewing, Walt 
Frazier and Willis Reed.[19] Harry Gallatin and Dick McGuire were also 
well-known standouts on the team and were later enshrined in the Naismith 
Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[19] Following these back-to-back losses, 
the Knicks made the playoffs in the subsequent two years with no success. 
Lapchick resigned as the team's head coach in January 1956 citing health-related 
issues.[22] Vince Boryla made his debut in February 1956 as the Knicks' 
new coach in a win over the St. Louis Hawks.[23] However, after two seasons 
of poor performances and no playoff appearances, Boryla tendered his resignation 
from the team in April 1958.[24] Looking to regain their former dominance, 
Andrew Levane was named the head coach and in his first year, the results 
were significantly better as the team finished with a 40–32 record, securing 
their playoff spot.[25] However, the Knicks could not manage to get past 
the Eastern Division semi-finals.[25] The Levane-led squad fared poorly 
to begin the 1959–60 season and under mounting pressure Levane resigned 
and was immediately replaced by Carl Braun, who became the team's first 
player-coach.[26] The team did not fare much better under Braun and the 
Knicks hired Eddie Donovan, who helped build up St. Bonaventure's basketball 
team, in 1961.[27] During Donovan's tenure, New York failed to achieve 
a playoff berth. As a testament to their struggles, on March 2, 1962, the 
Knicks faced the Philadelphia Warriors in Hershey, Pennsylvania, where 
they infamously allowed Wilt Chamberlain to score an NBA-record 100 points 
in a 169–147 Warriors victory.[19][25] In 1964, the franchise's fortunes 
began to take a steady turn. The Knicks drafted center Willis Reed, who 
made an immediate impact on the court and was named NBA Rookie of the Year 
for his efforts.[19] However, the leaders of the team still remained in 
flux. In an attempt to reorganize, the Knicks named former standout Harry 
Gallatin as head coach while reassigning Donovan to general manager position.[28] 
After a slow start in 1965, Dick McGuire, another former Knick, replaced 
his former teammate Gallatin midway through the season.[25] Though he failed 
to guide the Knicks to the playoffs in 1965, he managed to do so the following 
season, however the Knicks lost in the Eastern Division semi-finals.[25] 
McGuire was abruptly replaced midway through the 1967–68 season after the 
team began the season with a 15–22 record.[25] With the Knicks under .500, 
the team decided to hire coach Red Holzman, whose impact was immediate. 
Under his direction, the Knicks went 28–17 and finished with a 43–39 record 
thus salvaging a playoff berth, however the Knicks were again vanquished 
in the Eastern Division semi-finals by the Philadelphia 76ers.[25] However 
their roster was slowly coming together piece by piece. Rookies Phil Jackson 
and Walt Frazier were named to the NBA All-Rookie Team while Dick Barnett 
and Willis Reed performed in the 1968 NBA All-Star Game.[19] The following 
season, the team acquired Dave DeBusschere from the Detroit Pistons, and 
the team went 54–28.[25][29] In the playoffs, New York made it past the 
first round of contention for the first time since 1953, sweeping the Baltimore 
Bullets in four games, before falling to the Boston Celtics in the Eastern 
Division finals.[30] In the 1969–70 season, the Knicks had a then-single-season 
NBA record 18 straight victories en route to a 60–22 record, which was 
the best regular season record in the franchise's history to that point.[31][32] 
After defeating the Bullets in the Eastern Division semifinals and the 
Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Division finals, the Knicks faced the Los 
Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals.[31] With the series tied at 2–2, the 
Knicks would be tested in Game 5. Willis Reed tore a muscle in his right 
leg in the second quarter, and was lost for the rest of the game.[33] Despite 
his absence, New York went on to win the game, rallying from a 16-point 
deficit.[33] Without their injured captain the Knicks lost Game 6, setting 
up one of the most famous moments in NBA history.[33] Reed limped onto 
the court before the seventh game, determined to play through the pain 
of his injury.[33] He scored New York's first two baskets before going 
scoreless for the remainder of the contest.[33] Although he was not at 
full strength, Reed's heroics inspired the Knicks, and they won the game 
by a score of 113–99, allowing New York to capture the title that had eluded 
them for so long.[33] Reed, who had been named the All-Star MVP and the 
league's MVP that season, was named MVP of the Finals, becoming the first 
player to attain all three awards in a single season.[33] The Knicks' success 
continued for the next few years. After losing to the Bullets in the 1971 
Eastern Conference finals, the team, aided by the acquisitions of Jerry 
Lucas and Earl "The Pearl" Monroe, returned to the Finals in 1972.[19] 
This time the Knicks fell to the Lakers in five games.[19] The next year, 
the results were reversed, as the Knicks defeated the Lakers in five games 
to win their second NBA title in four years.[34] The team had one more 
impressive season in 1973–74, as they reached the Eastern Conference finals, 
where they fell in five games to the Celtics.[35] It was after this season 
that Willis Reed announced his retirement, and the team's fortunes began 
to shift once more.[36] In the 1974–75 season, the Knicks posted a 40–42 
record, their first losing record in eight seasons. However, the team still 
qualified for a playoff spot, however the opportunity was squandered as 
they lost to the Houston Rockets in the first round.[19] After two more 
seasons with losing records,[25] Holzman was replaced by Willis Reed who 
signed a three-year contract.[37] In Reed's first year, New York finished 
the year with a 43–39 record and returned to the Eastern Conference semi-finals, 
where they were swept by the Philadelphia 76ers.[38] The next season, after 
the team began with a 6–8 record,[39] Holzman was rehired as the team's 
coach after Reed had angered Madison Square Garden president Sonny Werblin.[40][41] 
The team did not fare any better under Holzman's direction, finishing with 
a 31–51 record, their worst in thirteen years.[39] After improving to a 
39–43 record in the 1979–80 season, the Knicks posted a 50–32 record in 
the 1980–81 season.[19] In the playoffs, the Chicago Bulls swept New York 
in two games.[19] Holzman retired the following season as one of the winningest 
coaches in NBA history. The team's record that year was a dismal 33–49.[19] 
However, Holzman's legacy would continue through the players he influenced. 
One of the Knicks' bench players and defensive specialists during the 1970s 
was Phil Jackson. Jackson went on to coach the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles 
Lakers to eleven NBA championships, surpassing Red Auerbach for the most 
in NBA history. Jackson cited Holzman as a significant influence on his 
career in the NBA.[42] Hubie Brown replaced Holzman as head coach and in 
his first season, the team went 44–38 and make it to the second round of 
the playoffs, where they were swept by the eventual champion Philadelphia 
76ers.[43] The next season, the team, aided by new acquisition Bernard 
King, improved to 47–35 and returned to the playoffs.[19] The team defeated 
the Detroit Pistons in the first round with an overtime win in the fifth 
and deciding game, before losing in second round in seven games to the 
Celtics.[19] The team's struggles continued into the 1984–85 season, as 
they lost their last twelve games to finish with a 24–58 record.[19] The 
first of these losses occurred on March 23, 1985, where King injured his 
knee and spent the next 24 months in rehabilitation.[19] In the summer 
of 1985, the Knicks were entered into the first-ever NBA Draft Lottery.[44] 
The Knicks ended up winning the number one pick in that year's NBA draft. 
They used the pick to select star center Patrick Ewing of Georgetown University.[44] 
In Ewing's first season with the Knicks, he led all rookies in scoring 
(20 points per game) and rebounds (9 rebounds per game), and he won the 
NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[45] The team would not fare as well, though, 
as they struggled to a 23–59 record in his first season.[25] During Ewing's 
second season, the team started with a 4–12 record and head coach Hubie 
Brown was dismissed in favor of assistant Bob Hill.[46] Under Hill, the 
Knicks had brief successes but went on to lose seventeen of their twenty-one 
final games of the season to finish 20–46 under Hill and 24–58 on the season.[47][48] 
Hill was dismissed at season's end.[49] The team immediately turned around 
in the 1987–88 season with the hiring of Rick Pitino as head coach, who, 
only months prior to his hiring, led Providence College to the Final Four, 
turning around a program that had struggled prior to his arrival.[49] Combined 
with the selection of point guard Mark Jackson, who won the NBA Rookie 
of the Year Award and garnered MVP consideration, in the draft and with 
Ewing's consistently stellar play, the Knicks made the playoffs with a 
record of 38–44, where they were defeated by the Celtics in the first round.[50][51] 
The resurgence continued the following season as the team traded backup 
center Bill Cartwright to the Bulls for power forward Charles Oakley before 
the season started and then posted a 52–30 record, which was good enough 
for their first division title in eighteen years and their fifth division 
title in franchise history.[52][53][54] In the playoffs, they defeated 
the 76ers in the first round before losing to the Chicago Bulls in the 
Eastern Conference semi-finals.[53] Prior to the start of the 1989–90 season, 
Pitino departed from New York to coach for the University of Kentucky leaving 
many stunned by his departure.[55] Assistant Stu Jackson was named as Pitino's 
replacement becoming the team's fourteenth head coach and the youngest 
head coach in the NBA, at the time, at the age of thirty-two.[56] Under 
Jackson's direction, the Knicks went 45–37 and defeated the Celtics in 
the first round of the playoffs, winning the final three games after losing 
the first two. They went on to lose to the eventual NBA champion Detroit 
Pistons in the next round.[57] Jackson and the Knicks struggled to a 7–8 
record to begin the 1990–91 season and Jackson was replaced by John MacLeod 
who led the Knicks to a 32–35 record, ending the season with a 39–43 record 
overall that was good enough to earn the team another playoff appearance. 
The Knicks were swept in the first round by the eventual NBA champion, 
Chicago Bulls.[58] After the conclusion of the season, MacLeod left the 
team to become the head coach at the University of Notre Dame. President 
David Checketts reached out to Pat Riley, who was working as a commentator 
for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), to see if he was interested 
in returning to coaching. Riley accepted the Knicks proposition on May 
31, 1991.[59] Riley, who coached the Lakers to four NBA titles during the 
1980s, implemented a rough and physical style emphasizing defense.[59] 
Under Riley, the team, led by Ewing and guard John Starks, who scored 24 
points per game and 13.9 points per game respectively, improved to a 51–31 
record, tying them for first place in the Atlantic Division.[60][61] After 
defeating the Pistons in the first round of the playoffs, the team faced 
the Bulls, losing the series 4–3 in seven games.[61] The 1992–93 season 
proved to be even more successful, as the Knicks won the Atlantic Division 
with a 60–22 record. Before the season, the Knicks traded Mark Jackson 
to the Los Angeles Clippers for Charles Smith, Doc Rivers, and Bo Kimble 
while also acquiring Rolando Blackman from the Dallas Mavericks. After 
defeating the Indiana Pacers and Charlotte Hornets in the first two rounds 
of the playoffs, the Knicks made it to the Eastern Conference finals, where 
once again they met the Bulls. After taking a two games-to-none lead, the 
Knicks lost the next four games. After the Bulls' Michael Jordan made what 
would be his first retirement from basketball prior to the 1993–94 season, 
many saw this as an opportunity for the Knicks to finally make it to the 
NBA Finals. The team, who acquired Derek Harper in a midseason trade with 
the Dallas Mavericks, once again won the Atlantic Division with a 57–25 
record. In the playoffs, the team played a then NBA-record 25 games (the 
Boston Celtics played 26 games in the 2008 playoffs); they started by defeating 
the New Jersey Nets in the first round before finally getting past the 
Bulls, defeating them in the second round in seven games. In the Eastern 
Conference Finals, they faced the Indiana Pacers, who at one point held 
a three games-to-two lead. They had this advantage thanks to the exploits 
of Reggie Miller, who scored 25 fourth quarter points in Game 5 to lead 
the Pacers to victory. However, the Knicks won the next two games to reach 
their first NBA Finals since 1973. In the finals, the Knicks would play 
seven low-scoring, defensive games against the Houston Rockets. After splitting 
the first two games in Houston, the Knicks would win two out of three games 
at Madison Square Garden, which also hosted the New York Rangers first 
Stanley Cup celebration in 54 years following their win over the Vancouver 
Canucks in Game 7 of their finals during the series. (A Knicks win would 
have made the Garden the first building to host a Cup winner and an NBA 
champ in the same season.) In Game 6, however, a last-second attempt at 
a game-winning shot by Starks was tipped by Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon, 
giving the Rockets an 86–84 victory and forcing a Game 7. The Knicks lost 
Game 7 90–84, credited in large part to Starks's dismal 2-for-18 shooting 
performance and Riley's stubborn refusal to bench Starks, despite having 
bench players who were renowned for their shooting prowess, such as Rolando 
Blackman and Hubert Davis available. The loss denied New York the distinction 
of having both NBA and NHL championships in the same year. Nevertheless, 
the Knicks had gotten some inspiration from Mark Messier and the Rangers 
during the finals. The next year, the Knicks were second place in the Atlantic 
Division with a 55–27 record. The team defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 
before facing the Pacers again in the second round. The tone for the Knicks–Pacers 
series was set in Game 1, as Miller once again became a clutch nuisance 
to the Knicks by scoring eight points in the final 8 seconds of the game 
to give the Pacers a 107–105 victory. The series went to a Game 7, and 
when Patrick Ewing's last-second finger roll attempt to tie the game missed, 
the Pacers clinched the 97–95 win. Riley resigned[62] the next day, and 
the Knicks hired Don Nelson as their new head coach. However Nelson's uptempo 
approach clashed with the Knicks' defensive identity, and during the 1995–96 
season, Nelson was fired after 59 games, and, instead of going after another 
well-known coach, the Knicks hired longtime assistant Jeff Van Gundy, who 
had no prior experience as a head coach. The Knicks ended up with a 47–35 
record that year, and swept the Cavaliers in the first round of the playoffs 
before losing to the eventual champion Bulls (who had an NBA record 72 
wins in the regular season) in five games. In the 1996–97 season, the Knicks, 
with the additions of such players as Larry Johnson and Allan Houston, 
registered a 57–25 record. In the playoffs, the Knicks swept the Charlotte 
Hornets in the first round before facing the Miami Heat (coached by Riley) 
in the second round. The Knicks took a 3–1 lead in the series before a 
brawl near the end of Game 5 resulted in suspensions of key players. Many 
of the suspended Knicks players, Ewing in particular, were disciplined 
not for participating in the altercation itself, but for violating an NBA 
rule stipulating that a benched player may not leave the bench during a 
fight (the rule was subsequently amended, making it illegal to leave the 
"bench area"). With Ewing and Houston suspended for Game 6, Johnson and 
Starks suspended for Game 7, and Charlie Ward suspended for both, the Knicks 
lost the series. The 1997–98 season was marred by a wrist injury to Ewing 
on December 22, which forced him to miss the rest of the season and much 
of the playoffs. The team, which had a 43–39 record that season, still 
managed to defeat the Heat in the first round (a series, which saw another 
violent bench clearing brawl at the end of Game 4, this time between Johnson 
and former Hornets teammate Alonzo Mourning) of the playoffs before having 
another meeting with the Pacers in the second round. Ewing returned in 
time for game two of the series. This time, the Pacers easily won the series 
in five games, as Reggie Miller once again broke the hearts of Knicks fans 
by hitting a tying three-pointer with 5.1 seconds remaining in Game 4, 
en route to a Pacers overtime victory. For the fourth straight year, the 
Knicks were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs. Prior to the 
lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Knicks traded Charles Oakley to the 
Toronto Raptors for Marcus Camby while also trading John Starks in a package 
to the Golden State Warriors for 1994's 1st team all league shooting guard 
Latrell Sprewell (whose contract was voided by the Warriors after choking 
Warriors' head coach P. J. Carlesimo during the previous season). After 
barely getting into the playoffs with a 27–23 record, the Knicks started 
a Cinderella run. It started with the Knicks eliminating the #1 seeded 
Heat in the first round after Allan Houston bounced in a running one-hander 
off the front of the rim, high off the backboard, and in with 0.8 seconds 
left in the deciding 5th game. This remarkable upset marked only the second 
time in NBA history that an 8-seed had defeated the 1-seed in the NBA playoffs, 
and also the first time it happened in the Eastern Conference. After defeating 
the Atlanta Hawks in the second round four games to none, they faced the 
Pacers yet again in the Eastern Conference Finals. Despite losing Ewing 
to injury for the rest of the playoffs prior to Game 3, the Knicks won 
the series (aided in part to a four-point play by Larry Johnson in the 
final seconds of Game 3) to become the first eighth-seeded playoff team 
to make it to the NBA Finals. However, in the Finals, the San Antonio Spurs, 
with superstars David Robinson and Tim Duncan, proved too much for the 
injury-laden Knicks, who lost in five games. The remarkable fifth game 
of this Finals is remembered for its 2nd half scoring duel between the 
Spurs' Tim Duncan and the Knicks' Latrell Sprewell, and was decided by 
a long jumper by Avery Johnson with 47 seconds left to clinch the title 
for the Spurs. The 1999–2000 season, would prove to be the last one in 
New York for Ewing, as the Knicks, who had a 50–32 record that season swept 
the Toronto Raptors a team led by Vince Carter, Antonio Davis and a young 
Tracy McGrady in three games in the first round, defeated the Miami Heat 
in another dramatic 7-game series in which Ewing's dunk with over a minute 
remaining in game 7, provided the winning margin in a 1-point road victory. 
They would however lose in the Eastern Conference Finals to the Reggie 
Miller-led Indiana Pacers in six games. After the season, Ewing was traded[63] 
on September 20, 2000, to the Seattle SuperSonics, and the Ewing era, which 
produced many successful playoff appearances but no NBA championship titles, 
came to an end.[64] Despite the loss of Ewing, the Knicks remained successful 
in the regular season, as they posted a 48–34 record under the direction 
of Houston and Sprewell.[65] In the first round of playoff contention, 
however, New York fell to the Toronto Raptors in five games, failing to 
get past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in a decade.[66] 
After a poor start to the season, the Knicks managed to get above .500 
with a 10–9 record.[67] In spite of their recent success, Van Gundy unexpectedly 
resigned[68] as head coach on December 8, 2001 explaining he had "lost 
focus" and would no longer be able to properly coach the team.[69] The 
team, which named longtime assistant Don Chaney as their new head coach, 
ended the season with a 30–52 record, and for the first time since the 
1986–87 season they did not qualify for the playoffs.[25][67] In October 
2002, the team elected to extend Chaney's contract for another year.[70] 
Rather than rebuilding, the Knicks opted to add veterans to the roster 
including Antonio McDyess who had been dealing with knee problems in the 
preceding years.[71][72] Furthermore, the Knicks were criticized by many 
analysts as multiple players on the roster were overpaid in light of their 
poor performances, causing salary cap problems that would persist until 
Donnie Walsh took over as team president.[71][73] McDyess injured his knee 
during the team's third preseason game and was subjected to further operations 
in April 2003 after a CT scan revealed the injured knee necessitated he 
undergo bone-graft surgery.[72] The Knicks managed only seven wins in their 
first twenty games, setting the tone for the rest of the season, which 
they completed with a 37–45 record; it was their second consecutive season 
without a playoff appearance.[74] After a 10–18 start to the 2003–04 season, 
the Knicks underwent a massive overhaul. Isiah Thomas was named the Knicks' 
president on December 22, 2003 upon the firing of Scott Layden.[75] Thomas 
continued to restructure the team, firing Chaney after an unproductive 
tenure and hiring Hall of Famer Lenny Wilkens to coach the team.[76] Additionally, 
Thomas orchestrated multiple trades, including one that brought point guard 
Stephon Marbury to the team.[77] The team qualified for the playoffs that 
year with a 39–43 record, but were swept by the New Jersey Nets in the 
first round.[78] The series included a highly publicized spat between the 
Knicks' Tim Thomas and Nets' Kenyon Martin, in which Thomas all but challenged 
Martin to a fight and called him "Fugazy".[79] The following season, the 
Knicks struggled to a 17–22 record before Wilkens resigned as head coach.[80] 
Herb Williams, who had previously coached the team in a game against the 
Orlando Magic prior to the team hiring Wilkens, took over as interim head 
coach for the remainder of the season and did not fare much better as the 
Knicks ended their season with a 33–49 record and out of playoff contention.[78][80][81] 
Hoping to find a leader that could put the team back on track, New York 
hired Larry Brown to coach the team.[82] Brown, who idolized the team during 
his childhood, was well regarded for his coaching abilities and his arrival 
brought a sense of hope to the franchise.[82] Hoping to find the next Patrick 
Ewing, the Knicks drafted center Channing Frye and signed centers Jerome 
James and Eddy Curry, the former prior to the season and the latter during 
the season.[83] Curry, who reportedly had a worrying heart condition, refused 
to take a controversial DNA test, and fell out of favor with John Paxson, 
Chicago's general manager.[84] The Bulls signed-and-traded him to the Knicks 
along with Antonio Davis for Tim Thomas, Michael Sweetney, the Knicks 2006 
first round pick, and the right to swap first-round picks with the Knicks 
in 2007, as well as 2007 and 2009 second-round picks.[84] Isiah Thomas 
did not lottery-protect the picks, and the Knicks forfeited the second 
pick in the 2006 draft, and the ninth in the 2007 draft. With a bloated 
payroll, the Knicks stumbled to the second worst record in the NBA that 
season, at 23–59.[85][86] The season concluded with the firing and $18.5 
million buy-out of head coach Larry Brown after one season.[85][87] With 
the departure of Brown, team president Isiah Thomas took over the head 
coaching responsibilities.[85] Thomas continued his practice of signing 
players to high priced contracts while the franchise struggled to capitalize 
on their talent on the court. As a testament to their struggles, on December 
16, 2006, the Knicks and the Denver Nuggets broke into a brawl during their 
game in Madison Square Garden. With multiple players still serving a suspension 
as a result of the brawl, on December 20, 2006, David Lee created one of 
the most memorable plays in recent Knicks history, and served as a bright 
spot as the team's struggles persisted, during a game against the Charlotte 
Bobcats. With a tie game and 0.1 seconds left on the game clock in double 
overtime, Jamal Crawford inbounded from the sideline, near half-court. 
The ball sailed towards the basket, and with that 0.1 seconds still remaining 
on the game clock, Lee tipped the ball off of the backboard and into the 
hoop.[88] Because of the Trent Tucker Rule, a player is allowed solely 
to tip the ball to score when the ball is put back into play with three-tenths 
of a second or less remaining. Because of this rule, the rarity of Lee's 
play increases. The Knicks won, 111–109 in double overtime.[88] The Knicks 
improved by ten games in the 2006–2007 campaign in spite of injuries that 
ravaged the team at the end of the year; they ended with a 33–49 record, 
avoiding a 50-loss season by defeating the Charlotte Bobcats 94–93 on the 
last day of the season. During the 2007 offseason, the organization became 
embroiled in further controversy away from the basketball court. Anucha 
Browne Sanders, a former Knicks executive, had filed a sexual harassment 
lawsuit against Isiah Thomas and Madison Square Garden.[89] Faced with 
a trial, the jury returned a verdict finding Thomas and Madison Square 
Garden liable for sexual harassment.[90] The jury also levied $11.6 million 
in punitive damages against Madison Square Garden, though this was later 
reduced to $11.5 million in a settlement between both parties.[90] The 
ordeal proved embarrassing for the franchise, revealing sordid details 
about Knicks management and the environment at Madison Square Garden.[90] 
The Knicks struggled as they opened their 2007 campaign with a 2–9 record 
leaving many Knicks fans, frustrated with the franchise's lack of progress 
under Thomas, called for the coach's firing—the chant "Fire Isiah" became 
a common occurrence during the Knicks' home games.[91][92] On November 
29, 2007, the Knicks were handed one of their worst defeats in their history 
by the Boston Celtics, with a final score of 104–59.[93] This matched their 
third-largest margin of defeat.[93] New York went on to post an eighth 
consecutive losing season and tied the franchise mark for their worst record 
ever, at 23–59.[25] MSG chairman James Dolan hired former Indiana Pacers 
President Donnie Walsh on April 2, 2008 to take over Isiah Thomas's role 
as team president.[94] At the introductory press conference, Walsh, while 
not proclaiming to be a savior, did set goals, which included getting the 
team under the salary cap and bringing back a competitive environment.[95] 
Upon the conclusion of the 2007–2008 regular season, Walsh fired Thomas, 
and on May 13, 2008, officially named former Phoenix Suns head coach Mike 
D'Antoni as head coach.[96][97] D'Antoni signed a four-year, $24 million 
deal to coach the team.[97] The Knicks, holding the sixth pick in the 2008 
NBA draft, selected Danilo Gallinari on May 20, 2008.[98] On November 21, 
2008, the Knicks dealt one of their top scorers, Jamal Crawford, to the 
Golden State Warriors for Al Harrington.[99] Hours later, New York traded 
Zach Randolph, along with Mardy Collins, to the Los Angeles Clippers for 
Cuttino Mobley and Tim Thomas, with the intention of freeing cap space 
for the 2010 offseason, when top-flight players such as LeBron James, Dwyane 
Wade, Chris Bosh, and Amar'e Stoudemire would be available.[99] In February 
2009, the Knicks traded Tim Thomas, Jerome James, and Anthony Roberson 
to the Chicago Bulls for Larry Hughes, in addition to sending Malik Rose 
to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Chris Wilcox.[100][101] Additionally, 
the long-standing controversy with Stephon Marbury ended when the two sides 
agreed to a buy-out of Marbury's contract, which allowed him to sign with 
the Celtics when he cleared waivers on February 27, 2009.[102] In spite 
of a volatile roster, the Knicks improved by nine wins from the previous 
season in D'Antoni's first season, to finish 32–50, coinciding with the 
emergence of forward-center David Lee, who led the league with 65 double-doubles, 
and the continued development of guard Nate Robinson and swingman Wilson 
Chandler.[103][104][105][106] In the 2009 NBA draft, the Knicks selected 
forward Jordan Hill eighth after targets such as Stephen Curry, Jonny Flynn, 
and Ricky Rubio were off the board. Guard Toney Douglas was then selected 
29th with a pick, which was acquired from the Los Angeles Lakers.[107] 
Shortly afterwards, New York executed a trade with the Memphis Grizzlies 
in which the Knicks acquired Darko Miličić in exchange for Quentin Richardson.[107] 
The Knicks got off to their worst ten-game start in franchise history, 
producing nine losses, with just one win.[108] The Knicks responded by 
winning nine games and losing six in December.[109] On January 24, 2010, 
the Knicks suffered their worst home loss in Madison Square Garden history 
against the Dallas Mavericks in front of a sellout crowd. The 50-point 
loss was also the second-worst in Knicks franchise history.[110] On February 
17, the Knicks shook up the roster, trading Miličić to the Minnesota Timberwolves 
for Brian Cardinal and cash considerations.[111] A day later, the Knicks 
and Celtics swapped guard Nate Robinson for shooting guard Eddie House. 
The deal also included forward Marcus Landry going to the Celtics and the 
Knicks acquiring bench players J. R. Giddens and Bill Walker.[112] The 
Knicks also acquired All-Star forward Tracy McGrady from the Houston Rockets 
and point guard Sergio Rodríguez from the Sacramento Kings in a three-way 
trade. The deal sent Knicks shooting guard Larry Hughes to Sacramento and 
forward Jordan Hill and power forward Jared Jeffries to Houston. The trades, 
orchestrated to give the Knicks more cap space for the summer of 2010, 
netted the Knicks $30 million of cap space.[113] About three weeks after 
these team-changing trades, the Knicks played the Dallas Mavericks at American 
Airlines Center and blew them out by a score of 128–94 for their largest 
win of the season.[109][114] However, the Knicks were eliminated from playoff 
contention in late March 2010 and completed their season with a 29–53 record, 
a regression from their first season under D'Antoni.[109][115] The Knicks 
and former Phoenix Suns forward-center Amar'e Stoudemire came to an agreement 
on July 5, 2010.[116] The sign and trade deal was made official on July 
8 as Stoudemire agreed to an approximately $100 million contract over the 
span of five years.[116] Team president Donnie Walsh stated the signing 
of Stoudemire as a turning point for the future of a Knicks team that had 
struggled in recent years.[117] The Knicks continued to redesign their 
roster, trading David Lee to the Golden State Warriors for Anthony Randolph, 
Kelenna Azubuike and Ronny Turiaf.[118] The Knicks also struck deals with 
former Bobcats point guard Raymond Felton and Russian center Timofey Mozgov.[118] 
The Knicks regained their title as the most valuable franchise in the NBA 
following these acquisitions, though this was mainly due to the arrival 
of Stoudemire, whose star power allowed the team to resurge; the Knicks 
sold out their full-season ticket inventory for the first time since 2002.[119] 
D'Antoni along with Stoudemire and the core of young players, including 
Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Mozgov, Wilson Chandler and rookie Landry Fields, 
piloted the Knicks to a 28–26 record prior to the All-Star break, marking 
the first time the team had been above the .500 mark at that point of the 
season since 2000.[120] In spite of the team's mounting success,[121] New 
York made a push to acquire Denver Nuggets forward Carmelo Anthony. After 
months of speculation, on February 22, 2011, Anthony was traded to New 
York, with teammates Chauncey Billups, Shelden Williams, Anthony Carter, 
and former Knick Renaldo Balkman. Denver acquired Felton, Danilo Gallinari, 
Wilson Chandler, Mozgov, Kosta Koufos, a 2014 first-round draft pick, the 
Warriors' second-round draft picks for 2013 and 2014 and $3 million in 
cash. In addition, the Knicks sent Anthony Randolph and Eddy Curry to the 
Minnesota Timberwolves and in return the Timberwolves' Corey Brewer was 
sent to the Knicks.[122][123] The Knicks clinched their first playoff berth 
since the 2004 NBA Playoffs in a rout of the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 
3, 2011.[124] Carmelo Anthony ensured the franchise's first winning season 
since 2001 on April 10, 2011, against the Indiana Pacers, as Anthony scored 
the game-winning basket for the Knicks and subsequently blocked Danny Granger's 
shot in the final seconds of the game.[125] The Knicks were ultimately 
eliminated from contention in the first round on April 24, 2011 by the 
Boston Celtics, losing the series 0–4.[126] In spite of Donnie Walsh's 
successful efforts to help rebuild the franchise, he decided not to return 
as the team's president, electing to step down at the end of June 2011, 
citing the uncertainty surrounding his ability to continue to manage the 
daily operations of the team.[127] Glen Grunwald was elected as interim 
president and general manager.[127] Following the conclusion of the 2011 
NBA lockout, the Knicks engaged in a sign-and-trade deal with the Mavericks 
for center Tyson Chandler on December 10, 2011, with Chandler signing a 
four-year contract worth approximately $58 million.[128] In return, the 
Knicks sent Andy Rautins to the Mavericks, generating a trade exception 
for Dallas. Ronny Turiaf and $3 million in cash considerations were sent 
to the Wizards to complete the three-way trade. The Knicks also obtained 
the draft rights to Ahmad Nivins and Georgios Printezis from Dallas. In 
order to fit Chandler under the salary cap, Chauncey Billups was earlier 
waived under the amnesty clause of the new collective bargaining agreement.[128] 
To replace Billups at point guard, the Knicks signed Mike Bibby to a one-year, 
veteran minimum contract.[129] The Knicks also signed veteran point guard 
Baron Davis on December 19 to a one-year contract. At the time, Davis had 
suffered a herniated disk and was not expected to compete for about 6–8 
weeks, leaving Toney Douglas as the team's starting point guard.[130] The 
Knicks struggled early in the season because Douglas and Bibby struggled 
to facilitate the offense and subsequently, it became stagnated.[131] Subsequently, 
rookie Iman Shumpert was thrust into the role as the starting point guard 
after Douglas was relegated to the bench due to his struggles.[132] In 
addition, head coach D'Antoni also decided to use Carmelo Anthony as a 
point forward to help generate a more up-tempo offense; however, there 
were concerns Anthony was holding the ball for too long, thus contributing 
to the stagnation of the Knicks' offense.[133][134] With the Knicks struggling 
to an 8–15 record, D'Antoni inserted third-string point guard Jeremy Lin 
into the rotation against the New Jersey Nets on February 4, 2012.[133] 
Lin, who had been claimed off waivers on December 27 following an injury 
to Iman Shumpert, scored 25 points and had 7 assists en route to a Knicks 
win.[133][135] Lin was praised for his ability to facilitate the offense, 
something the Knicks had struggled to do for the first 23 games of the 
season.[133] Lin, exceeding expectations, was named the starter for the 
Knicks following a game against the Utah Jazz.[136] Lin guided the Knicks 
to a seven-game winning streak, despite being without Anthony and Amar'e 
Stoudemire for five games due to a groin injury and a death in the family 
respectively, that brought the team back to a .500 winning percentage.[137][138][139] 
The surge of positive play by the Knicks accompanied by the performance 
of Lin caused extensive national and worldwide media coverage that was 
referred to as 'Linsanity'.[140] To bolster their depth and perimeter shooting 
percentage, the Knicks signed J. R. Smith on February 18, 2012.[141] The 
team struggled to congeal when Anthony returned from injury and went on 
to lose seven of eight games before head coach Mike D'Antoni resigned on 
March 14, 2012. Assistant Mike Woodson was named the interim head coach.[142] 
Under Woodson, the Knicks finished 18–6 during the regular season and clinched 
a playoff spot for the second straight year this time as the seventh seed, 
making it the first time they have clinched consecutive playoff berths 
since making 13 straight playoff appearances from 1988 to 2001.[25][143] 
Not only did they also clinch consecutive winning seasons for the first 
time in a decade, but their 36–30 record was the highest winning percentage 
for the team since the 2000–01 NBA season.[25] The Knicks faced the Miami 
Heat in the first round of the playoffs and lost the first three games, 
breaking the NBA record for longest playoff losing streak at 13 games.[144] 
The team's struggles were partially attributed to injuries as Jeremy Lin, 
Baron Davis and Iman Shumpert were all sidelined by knee ailments.[145] 
The Knicks proceeded to win a close Game 4, which snapped their streak 
and ensured that they would not be swept out of the first round however, 
they failed to keep up with the Heat's up-tempo offense in Game 5 and lost 
the series 4–1.[145] Despite the team's disappointing postseason exit, 
the Knicks removed Woodson's interim status and he was officially named 
the full-time head coach on May 25, 2012.[146] The Knicks began their offseason 
by selecting Greek forward Kostas Papanikolaou in the 2012 NBA draft. One 
week later, the team came to terms with veteran point guard Jason Kidd, 
who was originally supposed to serve as a backup to Lin. The Knicks also 
re-acquired Marcus Camby from the Houston Rockets in a sign and trade sending 
Houston Josh Harrellson, Jerome Jordan, Toney Douglas and 2014 and 2015 
two second round picks and completed a sign-and-trade with the Portland 
Trail Blazers that brought back Raymond Felton and Kurt Thomas in exchange 
for Jared Jeffries, Dan Gadzuric, and the draft rights to Papanikolaou 
and Greek forward Georgios Printezis, whose draft rights had been acquired 
by the Knicks in December 2011. The Knicks also re-signed free agents J. 
R. Smith and Steve Novak and added more players to the roster, such as 
James White, Chris Copeland, and Argentinian point guard Pablo Prigioni. 
However the Knicks lost restricted free agents shooting guard, Landry Fields 
to the Toronto Raptors and point guard, Jeremy Lin to the Houston Rockets, 
who were both key players during the 2011–12 NBA season. The Knicks decided 
not to match those teams' offers. Despite these losses, the Knicks continued 
to add players to the roster, signing former Chicago Bulls guard Ronnie 
Brewer on July 25, 2012 and signing Chris Smith, the younger brother of 
J. R. Smith, on August 1, 2012.[147][148][149] It was also announced that 
Rasheed Wallace would come out of retirement to play for the Knicks on 
October 2, 2012. Despite playing without an injured Iman Shumpert and Amar'e 
Stoudemire, the Knicks compiled an 18–5 record to start the season, their 
best start since 1993. In their first four games, they scored at least 
100 points and won by double digits in all of those games. The streak ended 
after a 10-point loss to Memphis Grizzlies. The following Sunday, in a 
game against the Indiana Pacers, the Knicks at home went on to win 88–76, 
assuring them a 7–1 record. After two tough losses to the Dallas Mavericks 
and Houston Rockets, the Knicks returned home in a game against the Detroit 
Pistons on November 25, with a 121–100 blowout win, making them one of 
only three teams undefeated at home along with the Miami Heat and Utah 
Jazz. The Knicks finished November with an 11–4 record, their best month 
record since going 11–6 in March 2000.[150] By the All-Star break in mid-February 
2013, the Knicks compiled a 32–18 record, good for second in the Eastern 
Conference. On February 21, on the trade deadline, the team traded Ronnie 
Brewer for a 2014 second-round draft pick. The Knicks then signed veteran 
power forward Kenyon Martin to a 10-day contract. In late March, the Knicks 
went on to compile a four-game losing streak, tying their worst skid of 
the season. They would go on and face the Jazz on the road, eventually 
winning the game and starting what would turn out to be a 13-game winning 
streak, including wins against the Miami Heat and the Oklahoma City Thunder. 
This was the third-longest winning streak in franchise history. On April 
9, the Knicks beat the Washington Wizards to secure the Atlantic Division 
title for the first time since the 1993–94 NBA season. The Knicks' 13-game 
winning streak came to an end on April 11 as they lost to the Chicago Bulls. 
Despite that, they set the NBA single season record for three-pointers. 
On May 3, the Knicks defeated the Boston Celtics in the first round of 
the NBA playoffs, 4–2, their first playoff victory since 2000. On May 18, 
the Knicks were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs, losing 
the series to the Indiana Pacers 4–2. Point guard Jason Kidd retired following 
the end of the season—he was named head coach of the Brooklyn Nets a few 
days later. In the 2013 NBA draft, the Knicks selected Tim Hardaway Jr. 
as the 24th pick in the first round. During the 2013 offseason, The Knicks 
claimed Los Angeles Lakers F Metta World Peace off of waivers. They resigned 
J. R Smith to a 3-year, $18 million deal and traded G Quentin Richardson, 
F Steve Novak, C Marcus Camby, and three draft picks to acquire F/C Andrea 
Bargnani from the Toronto Raptors. On September 26, 2013, the Knicks announced 
that they replaced GM Glen Grunwald with former MSG president Steve Mills.[151] 
On March 10, 2014, the Knicks announced that they had purchased an NBA 
D-League team that will play in White Plains at the start of the 2014–15 
NBDL season.[152] Forbes magazine released its franchise value rankings 
for NBA teams on January 22, listing the Knicks as the world's most valuable 
basketball organization at $1.4 billion, edging out the Los Angeles Lakers 
by $50 million. The Knicks were valued at 40% more than the third-place 
Chicago Bulls valuation of $1 billion, and were valued nearly twice as 
highly as their crosstown rivals, the Brooklyn Nets, who came in at $780 
million.[153] On January 24, 2014, Carmelo Anthony established his career 
high, the Knicks' franchise record, and the Madison Square Garden record 
for single-game scoring with a 62–point 13–rebound effort against the Charlotte 
Bobcats.[154] On March 18, 2014, the Knicks and Phil Jackson announced 
that he had been named President of the organization with Steve Mills remaining 
General Manager. Both Jackson and Mills will report directly to MSG chairman 
James Dolan.[155] On April 21, 2014, over one week after the conclusion 
of the Knicks' season, Mike Woodson and his entire staff were fired.[156] 
The Knicks finished the season with a disappointing 37–45 record and finished 
9th in the Eastern Conference standings. On June 9, 2014, the Knicks hired 
Derek Fisher as the head coach. Fisher played under Jackson with the Los 
Angeles Lakers, winning five (5) NBA championships with the Lakers.[157] 
On June 25, 2014, the Knicks traded controversial guard Raymond Felton 
along with former NBA defensive player of the year Tyson Chandler to the 
Dallas Mavericks. In return the Knicks received Shane Larkin, José Calderón, 
Samuel Dalembert, and Wayne Ellington along with two picks for the following 
day's draft. The trade was the first one that Phil Jackson ever executed 
as a front office executive. On June 26, as part of the 2014 NBA draft, 
the Knicks selected Cleanthony Early as the 34th overall pick and Thanasis 
Antetokounmpo as the 51st overall pick, using the draft picks received 
in the trade from the Dallas Mavericks. The Knicks also acquired Louis 
Labeyrie, an additional second round draft pick, after he was traded by 
the Pacers. On January 7, 2015, the Knicks set a franchise record with 
its 13th consecutive loss. The Knicks fell 101–91 to the Washington Wizards, 
giving New York its longest losing streak in the franchise's 69 season 
history.[158] This record was extended to 16th consecutive losses, after 
the NBA Global Games loss against the Milwaukee Bucks in London. On February 
15, 2015, the Knicks bought out Amar'e Stoudemire's contract. The Knicks 
finished their 2014–15 season with a win-loss record of 17–65, which is 
the worst record in franchise history. On June 24, 2015, the Knicks selected 
Kristaps Porziņģis with the 4th overall pick in the draft and traded Tim 
Hardaway Jr. to the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for Jerian Grant, the 19th 
overall pick. On February 8, 2016, Fisher was relieved of his coaching 
duties, while Kurt Rambis was named as interim head coach.[159] The first 
logo of the New York Knicks is of a character named "Father Knickerbocker" 
dribbling a basketball, in the iconic blue and orange colors. It was designed 
by New York World-Telegram cartoonist Willard Mullin.[160] From the beginning, 
the Knicks home uniforms are in white with blue and orange trim, while 
the away uniforms are in blue with orange and white trim. The first iterations 
contain monotone lettering in blue (home) and orange (away) lettering, 
with the addition of a checkerboard pattern during the mid-1950s. The Knicks 
would introduce an iconic logo that would endure for the next three decades. 
Designed by Bud Freeman, the word 'Knicks' superimposed over a brown basketball 
is known as the 'Classic Roundball Logo', with minor changes throughout 
its lifespan such as maroon wordmark and orange basketball.[160] An alternate 
logo featuring the full team name inside an orange basketball was used 
during the late 1960s and into the 1970s. As the 1960s began, the Knicks 
updated their uniforms again. This time the lettering is in serifed fonts, 
and the blue lettering and numbers on the home uniforms are now trimmed 
in orange, while on the away uniforms it is in monotone white. Side stripes 
were also added to the uniform. The 'NY' monogram is on the left leg of 
the shorts. The Knicks unveiled a uniform that would stay for three decades. 
This uniform, with an arched 'NEW YORK' in serif lettering and in orange, 
would be the uniform worn during their 1970 and 1973 championship seasons; 
however they were not introduced simultaneously. The home uniforms would 
debut in 1968, while the away uniforms debuted the following year. One 
noticeable feature was that the player's name was in a straight block arched 
lettering, which was meticulously designed by Gerry Cosby and his sporting 
goods company. The unusual arrangement on the player's name was later adopted 
by several Major League Baseball teams in the 1970s, and are currently 
used by the National Hockey League's Colorado Avalanche, Detroit Red Wings 
and New York Rangers. On the shorts, there was no logo placed during much 
of the 1970s, but during the 1978–79 season, the side stripes were eliminated 
and the interlocking 'NY' logo inside an apple was placed instead. When 
the uniform was reinstated for the 1983–84 season, it now featured the 
player's number and the interlocking 'NY' logo, in addition to the return 
of the side stripes. The shorts number was eliminated in 1987, while variations 
of the 'Roundball Logo' replaced the 'NY' logo from 1991–97. Since the 
1991–92 season various outfitters such as Champion, Puma, Reebok and Adidas 
have taken over uniform production from Cosby, while player names reverted 
to a radial arch and added serifs. At the beginning of the 1980s the Knicks 
radically changed their uniforms. Royal blue and orange were replaced by 
navy and maroon. During this period, the home uniforms featured the team 
name below the number, both in maroon with navy trim and in a stylized, 
free-flowing font. Navy away uniforms continue to feature the city name 
but below the white and maroon number. The interlocking 'NY' logo debuted 
on the shorts, with the addition of player numbers and side stripes during 
the 1981–82 season. The 'Knicks' script from the 'Maroon Era' uniforms 
was later reused in the uniforms of the Knicks' NBA Development League 
affiliate Westchester Knicks, with the same team name below the number 
format. Before the 1992–93 season the Knicks updated their 'Roundball Logo' 
to its present form, with the word 'Knicks' in a futuristic font, again 
superimposed over a basketball, with a silver triangle accentuating the 
look. The "New Look" logo was designed by Tom O'Grady.[160] For the 1995–96 
season, the city name in a futuristic script was added atop the logo, while 
an alternate 'Subway Token' logo featuring the acronym 'NYK' was introduced. 
Black was also introduced as an accent color. The logo was added while 
the 'Championship Era' uniforms were still in use, but during the 1995–96 
season, the Knicks unveiled a blue alternate uniform, this time featuring 
black side stripes and the aforementioned 'Subway Token' logo on the shorts' 
beltline. A home white version of this uniform was introduced for the 1997–98 
season, effectively retiring the championship era uniforms. In the 2001–02 
season, the side stripes were narrowed, while the 'Subway Token' logo was 
moved to the back of the uniform, and the Knicks primary logo moved from 
the side to the front of the shorts. The Knicks updated their 'New Look 
Logo', this time eliminating the color black from the scheme. They still 
used the previous uniform during the 2011–12 season, but for the 2012–13 
season, the Knicks unveiled new uniforms inspired from their 'Championship 
Era' uniforms. A more subtle and bolder 'New York' script was introduced, 
while the uniform piping stopped until the lettering. The phrase Once A 
Knick, Always A Knick is added on the uniform collar. Gray became the accent 
color.[2] In addition, an updated version of their 1970s secondary logo, 
this time featuring only the team name, was introduced.[161] On October 
25, 2013, the Knicks unveiled an alternate orange uniform, which is basically 
a mirror image of the blue away uniforms, but with orange as the primary 
color and blue and white as trim colors.[162] The uniforms debuted on October 
31 in a road game against the Chicago Bulls, and were used in the first 
five weekend home games, but after going 0–6 in the orange uniforms, they 
were discontinued permanently. The Knicks have also worn special edition 
uniforms every March as part of the NBA's Noche Latina events and during 
St. Patrick's Day. The uniforms during Noche Latina were originally white 
with blue and orange trim, first using the 2001–12 uniform from 2008–12, 
and then the current uniforms from 2012–15, the only exception being Nueva 
York in front. In the 2015–16 season, the Knicks used a variation of their 
away blue uniform for Noche Latina. The Saint Patrick's Day uniforms used 
the road uniform template except for green substituting for the blue base. 
These uniforms have also been used on Christmas Day from 2009–10, and was 
worn in particular by Nate Robinson for a "Kryptonate vs. Superman" theme 
against Dwight Howard in the 2009 Slam Dunk Contest. The St. Patrick's 
uniforms were shelved after the 2011–12 season. On Christmas Day 2012, 
the Knicks wore monochrome uniforms known as 'Big Color'. The uniforms 
are mostly orange, with blue trimming. The following year, the Knicks wore 
sleeved orange uniforms known as 'Big Logo', featuring a chrome-treated 
Knicks logo in front. For the 2014 edition, the Knicks wore a variation 
of their home uniforms, featuring the team logo in front and the player's 
first name in a blue nameplate below the number. Roster • Transactions

York Knicks and the Boston Celtics are two of the three remaining teams 
from the original 1946 NBA (the other is the Golden State Warriors). The 
rivalry stems from the old rivalry between the cities of New York City 
and Boston, as well as the Yankees–Red Sox rivalry. The fact that Boston 
and New York City are only 190 miles apart contributes to it, which is 
also seen in the Jets–Patriots rivalry. The teams have met 9 times in the 
post-season. The last time was in the 2012–13 season, when Carmelo Anthony 
won the 2013 scoring title and helped them win the Atlantic Division for 
the first time since 1994. The Knicks faced the Celtics, who were without 
Rajon Rondo because of a mid-season injury, in the 1st round of the 2013 
playoffs. In both games 1 and 2, Celtics had a lead going into halftime 
but were held to 25 and 23 points respectively in the second half, which 
was an all-time low for the franchise in the playoffs. Knicks gained a 
3-0 lead in the series, but Boston avoided elimination in games 4 and 5. 
In game six, Knicks once led by 26 points in the fourth quarter, then the 
Celtics went onto a 20-0 run in less than 5 minutes to make it a close 
game, but Knicks still won and moved on to round 2. The Brooklyn Nets, 
formerly the New Jersey Nets, are the Knicks' closest rival geographically. 
Both teams play in New York City, with the Knicks in Manhattan and the 
Nets in Brooklyn. Media outlets have noted the Knicks-Nets rivalry's similarity 
to those of other New York City teams, such as Major League Baseball's 
Subway Series rivalry between the American League's New York Yankees and 
the National League's New York Mets, due to both boroughs' proximity through 
the New York City Subway. Historically, the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn 
competed via the Dodgers–Giants rivalry, when the two teams were known 
as the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. Like the Knicks and Nets, 
the Giants and Dodgers played in Manhattan and Brooklyn, respectively, 
and were fierce divisional rivals.[180] The rivalry between the New York 
Islanders and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League also have 
this distinction when the Islanders moved to Brooklyn in 2015.[181] Due 
to the Knicks and Nets being located in the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn, 
some media outlets have dubbed this rivalry "Clash of the Boroughs".[182] 
The Knicks and Nets have met in the playoffs three times, with the Knicks 
winning two of the three meetings. The Knicks defeated the Nets in the 
playoffs in 1983 and 1994, while the Nets won their most recent meeting 
in 2004. The Knicks have a strong rivalry with the Chicago Bulls. The rivalry's 
most intense period was during the late 1980s and early 90s, when both 
teams were huge playoff contenders. This intensity was due to a variety 
of factors: the great frequency in which the teams competed against each 
other in high-stakes contests and playoff series; well-known players such 
as Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, and John Starks; the 
reputations of the team's respective cities; and personnel changes and 
conflicts between the teams. The rivalry was dormant through much of the 
2000s, with both teams rebuilding after the retirements of Patrick Ewing 
and Michael Jordan. However, with the arrival of future NBA MVP Derrick 
Rose in 2008, the Chicago Bulls began experiencing success once again. 
In the summer of 2010, the Bulls signed Carlos Boozer and the Knicks signed 
Amar'e Stoudemire, making both teams playoff contenders once again. Carmelo 
Anthony and Tyson Chandler joined the Knicks soon after, and the rivalry 
between the two teams appears to have been reborn. The rivalry between 
the New York Knicks and the Indiana Pacers started in 1993 and quickly 
became one of the most bitter in NBA history. They met in the playoffs 
6 times from 1993–2000, fueling a rivalry epitomized by the enmity between 
Reggie Miller and prominent Knick fan Spike Lee. Miller likened it to the 
Hatfield–McCoy feud, and The New York Times said in 1998 that it was "as 
combustible as any in the league". The rivalry gave Miller the nickname 
"The Knick-Killer". His clutch performances were frequently followed by 
jabs at Lee like the choke sign, adding fuel to the rivalry. The rivalry 
renewed during the 2013 NBA Playoffs in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, 
with Indiana taking the series 4 games to 2. The Miami Heat were one of 
the New York Knicks' strongest inter-divisional foes. The two teams met 
in the playoffs each year from 1997–2000, with all four of those series 
being played to the maximum amount of games. Pat Riley, the head coach 
of the Miami Heat at the time, served as the head coach of the Knicks from 
1991–1995 and led the Knicks to the 1994 NBA Finals. During this four-year 
span, the Heat and the Knicks each won two playoff series against each 
other. The two teams met again in the first round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs, 
for the first time since the 1990s rivalry days. The Heat won the series, 
4–1, and later went on to win the 2012 NBA Finals. The rivalry started 
due to the proximity of the cities, 2 hours by car, and rivalries between 
teams in different sports from the same cities: the Mets–Phillies rivalry 
in the Major League Baseball, Eagles–Giants rivalry in the National Football 
League, and Flyers–Rangers rivalry in the National Hockey League.[183][184] 
The New York Knicks and the Toronto Raptors had a playoff rivalry in 2000 
and 2001. The Raptors made their first-ever playoff appearance during the 
1999–2000 season, in which they were swept by the Knicks in the first round 
3–0. The following season, the Raptors redeemed themselves, defeating the 
Knicks in the first round 3–2; this effectively ended the Knicks' run as 
perennial NBA championship contenders, which began in the early 1990s.
