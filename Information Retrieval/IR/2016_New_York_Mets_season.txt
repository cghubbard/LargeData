The 2016 New York Mets season was the franchise's 55th season. The Mets 
opened the season against their 2015 World Series opponent, the Kansas 
City Royals.[1] This was the first time in the history of the league that 
World Series opponents played a rematch on Opening Day. This was made possible 
by interleague play being scattered throughout the season. Despite being 
below .500 (60-62) as late as August 19, the Mets went 27-13 in their final 
40 games to make the postseason for the second time in two consecutive 
seasons. They lost to the San Francisco Giants in the Wild Card Game. On 
November 24, 2015, Stolmy Pimentel signed a minor league deal with the 
Mets.[2] On December 2, 2015, bench coach Bob Geren left the Mets to join 
the Los Angeles Dodgers to fill the same position left by Tim Wallach who 
left to join the Miami Marlins in the same capacity. Geren served as the 
bench coach from 2011–2015.[3] Dick Scott was hired to replace Geren on 
December 16, 2015.[4] On December 3, the Mets signed pitcher Jim Henderson 
to a minor league deal.[5] On December 9, the Mets traded pitcher Jon Niese 
to the Pittsburgh Pirates for second baseman Neil Walker.[6] On December 
10, the Mets signed Asdrúbal Cabrera to a two-year, $18.5 million contract.[7] 
On December 14, the Mets signed Buddy Carlyle to a minor league deal for 
the third time since the offseason leading to the 2014 season.[8] Duane 
Below was re-signed as well to a minor league deal.[9] Marc Krauss was 
signed as well to a minor league deal. On December 15, the Mets signed 
Jerry Blevins to a one-year, $4 million contract with incentives.[10] On 
December 16, Bartolo Colón was re-signed to a one-year, $7.25 million contract. 
To make room for Colón, the Mets designated Johnny Monell for assignment 
on December 18, when the deal became official.[11] On December 23, Alejandro 
De Aza signed a one-year, $5.75 million contract with the Mets.[12] On 
December 23, Kirk Nieuwenhuis was claimed off waivers by the Milwaukee 
Brewers.[13] On January 15, 2016, Nevin Ashley was signed to a minor league 
deal with an invite to spring training.[14] On January 22, Antonio Bastardo 
was signed to a 2-year, $12 million contract.[15] On January 26, Yoenis 
Céspedes re-signed with the Mets on a 3-year, $75 million contract, with 
an opt out after the first season.[16] On January 22, Carlos Torres was 
designated for assignment by the Mets.[17] On January 29, Neil Walker signed 
a one-year, $10.55 million deal avoiding arbitration.[18] On January 30, 
the Mets placed Torres on waivers.[19] Torres cleared waivers on February 
1 and elected free agency.[20] On February 2, 2016, Darrell Ceciliani was 
traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for cash considerations.[21] On February 
8, 2016, Roger Bernadina signed with the Mets on a minor-league contract.[22] 
On February 12, Jenrry Mejía was permanently banned from the MLB after 
his third performance-enhancing drugs (PED) violation.[23] He became the 
first player to be banned for life due to PED use, and one of only two 
living people to be permanently banned, the other being Pete Rose.[24] 
Mejía is allowed to apply for reinstatement after one year. However, he 
must sit out a minimum of two years, meaning that he will not be eligible 
to pitch again until 2018 at the earliest.[25] The Mets began their 2016 
season by losing a close one in Kansas City, falling 4-3 at the hands of 
the Royals. Matt Harvey, making the Opening Day start, was hit around by 
the Royals, who took a 4-0 lead into the 8th. However, the Mets scored 
3 runs off Joakim Soria to make the game close. In the top of the ninth, 
facing Royals closer Wade Davis, the Mets put runners at the corners with 
one out, but Davis struck out David Wright and Yoenis Céspedes to close 
out the Royals' opening day victory. Following a narrow Opening Day defeat, 
the Mets split the series in Kansas City behind a scoreless outing by Noah 
Syndergaard and a two-run home run by Neil Walker. The Mets then returned 
home and won their home opener 7-2 against the Philadelphia Phillies. Jacob 
deGrom pitched six strong innings, while Walker and Michael Conforto both 
had multiple RBI's. The Mets then went on a brief four-game losing streak 
which dropped them to 2-5. During the slump, the offense stuggled to produce. 
However, the offense caught fire throughout the rest of the month, led 
by Neil Walker, who hit .315 with 9 home runs and 19 RBI's in his first 
month with the team. The Mets only scored less than four runs in a game 
once in April after April 15, and finished the opening month of the season 
with a 15-7 record. After a surging April, the Mets began to cool down 
in May. On May 7, Bartolo Colón became the oldest player to hit his first 
career home run at 42 years and 349 days old. It came off San Diego Padres 
pitcher, James Shields in a game against San Diego. Mets pitchers continued 
to hit when on May 11, Noah Syndergaard hit two home runs off of Los Angeles 
Dodgers pitcher, Kenta Maeda. The second home run gave the Mets the lead 
in the 5th inning. On May 27, the Mets returned to Citi Field to play the 
Los Angeles Dodgers in what was the first game in a 1986 World Championship 
30th Anniversary Weekend Celebration. New York won the first game on a 
Curtis Granderson walk-off home run, but lost the next two games, highlighted 
by Noah Syndergaard throwing behind Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley, 
an act that was seen as intentional as the Mets were trying to get revenge 
for Utley's questionable slide against the Mets in 2015 NLDS. The Mets 
finished the month with a record of 14-15. This dropped them to second 
place in the NL East to the Washington Nationals, who would never relinquish 
their lead in the division. The Mets continued to struggle in June, thanks 
largely in part to their anemic offense, which couldn't produce many runs, 
especially with runners in scoring position. Neil Walker, who had led the 
Mets in most offensive categories for the first two months, began to have 
a drop off in production. The Mets also could not beat teams in their division, 
getting swept by the Braves and Nationals. Pitching also became an issue 
for the Mets. While Bartolo Colón and Noah Syndergaard continued to pitch 
well, Steven Matz, Jacob deGrom and Matt Harvey would not win a game in 
June. The injury bug also began to bite New York, as Lucas Duda and David 
Wright went down with back and neck injuries, respectively. While Duda 
would return to the Mets later in the year, Wright would wind up missing 
the entire season. Duda would be replaced by James Loney, and the Mets 
brought back former shortstop José Reyes to fill in for Wright at third 
base. The move was greeted with criticism, as Reyes had been arrested for 
domestic violence in the offseason. However, Reyes filled in adequately.
