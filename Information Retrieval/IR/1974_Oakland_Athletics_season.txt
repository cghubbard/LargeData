The 1974 Oakland Athletics season involved the A's winning their fourth 
consecutive American League West title with a record of 90 wins and 72 
losses. In the playoffs, the A's defeated the Baltimore Orioles in the 
ALCS for their third straight AL pennant, and in the World Series, the 
first ever played entirely on the West Coast, defeated the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in five games to take their third consecutive World Series championship. 
Paid attendance for the season was 845,693.[1] In 1974, owner Charlie Finley 
tried to sell the team with an asking price of $15 million.[2] In 1974, 
"Hurricane" Herb Washington was tapped by Oakland owner Charlie Finley 
to become the A's "designated runner." Despite having no professional baseball 
experience, and having last played baseball in high school, Washington 
was signed to a major league contract prior to the season. His major league 
debut was on April 4, 1974 against the Texas Rangers. Appearing as a pinch 
runner for Joe Rudi in game two of the 1974 World Series, Washington was 
picked off first base in a crucial ninth-inning situation by Dodgers' reliever 
Mike Marshall. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Infielders
