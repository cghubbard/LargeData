William Edward "Roscoe" Coughlin (March 15, 1868 – March 20, 1951) was 
an American professional baseball player who was a pitcher for two seasons 
in the National League (NL). In 1890 he pitched for the Chicago Colts and 
in 1891 he played for the New York Giants. Prior to his Major League Baseball 
career, he began his minor league career in 1887, and continued afterward 
until 1897. Coughlin was born on March 15, 1868 in Walpole, Massachusetts, 
and at the age of 19, he began his minor league career in 1887 with the 
Lynn Lions of the New England League (NEL).[1][2][3] In 1888, he played 
for several minor league teams, including the Chicago Maroons of the newly 
founded Western Association, which covered many of the same locations as 
the American Association.[2][4] Later into the season, he moved to the 
west coast and played for the Oakland Greenhood & Morans, and the San Francisco 
Pioneers, both members of the California League (CL).[2] He then completed 
the season with the Portsmouth Lillies of the New England Interstate League (NEIL).[2][5] 
In 1889, Coughlin returned to Oakland and the CL, with which he played 
the entire season with the Colonels, won 30 games.[2][6] Coughlin began 
the 1890 season in the CL, however for a different team, the San Francisco 
Haverlys.[2] After registering 27 wins, he made his Major League Baseball 
debut on April 22 for the Chicago Colts of the NL, pitching them to a 13–3 victory 
over the Cincinnati Reds.[1][6][7] In his short time with the Colts, he 
had a 4–6 win–loss record, with his last decision occurring on June 11, 
in a 7–1 victory over the Cleveland Spiders in the first game of a doubleheader.[1][7] 
He completed the season with the Sacramento Senators of the CL.[2] He began 
the 1891 season with the Syracuse Stars of the Eastern Association, playing 
from April 24 until August 28, until he joined the New York Giants of the 
NL.[2] He pitched in eight games for the Giants, and finished the season 
with a 3–4 win–loss record.[1] His final appearance was on October 2, and 
was the last of his major league experience.[1] In 19 career games pitched, 
he had a 7–10 win–loss record, and had a 4.10 earned run average in 156 innings 
pitched.[1] Coughlin played for several minor league teams, beginning the 
season with the Syracuse/Utica Stars, with which he played from April 25 
to June 30, the Binghamton Bingos from July 20 to August 20, and the Rochester 
Flour Cities from August 21 to September 16, all of the Eastern League (EL)[8] 
From 1893 until into the 1897 season, he continued in EL, playing for the 
Springfield Ponies/Maroons.[2] Later in 1897, he switched over to the Borckton 
Shoemakers of the NEL, and pitched in five games and had a 1–3 win–loss 
record in 39 innings pitched.[2] He completed the season with the Wilkes-Barre 
Coal Barons of EL.[2] There is no record of him playing professional baseball 
following the 1897 season. Coughlin was a veteran of the Spanish–American 
War, died at the age of 83 on March 20, 1851, while living in the Old Soldiers
