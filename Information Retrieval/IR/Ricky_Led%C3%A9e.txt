Ricardo Alberto "Ricky" Ledée (born November 22, 1973 in Ponce, Puerto 
Rico) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder who played for the New 
York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers, Philadelphia Phillies, 
San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets in his decade-long 
professional career. He won two World Series championships with the Yankees 
in 1998 and 1999. Ledée, Darryl Strawberry, and José Vizcaíno are the only 
players who have played for all four current and former New York franchises—the 
Yankees, Mets, Dodgers and Giants. Drafted in the 16th round by New York 
in 1990, Ledée didn't break into the Major Leagues until 1998, playing 
in 42 games with the Yankees. The left-handed outfielder reached base in 
eight consecutive plate appearances in the 1998 World Series and was part 
of the Yankees' championship teams in both 1998 and 1999. In 2000, Ledée 
was batting only .241 for the Yankees when they traded him with pitchers 
Jake Westbrook and Zach Day to the Cleveland Indians in exchange for David 
Justice. He played just 17 games for the Indians before they traded him 
to the Texas Rangers for first baseman David Segui. He finished 2000 with 
the Rangers and was a reserve for the club in 2001. Since then, he has 
played for the Philadelphia Phillies, San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles 
Dodgers, and the New York Mets, who claimed him off waivers on August 8, 
2006. Ledée signed a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics on 
February 2, 2007, and was invited to their spring training camp, but was 
released March 25. The Mets signed him to another minor league contract 
March 31. He was a starting outfielder for their triple-A, Pacific Coast 
League affiliate, New Orleans Zephyrs, when they recalled him to the Major 
League roster June 8. On July 8, he was designated for assignment. On June 
25, 2004 Ledee was placed on the 15-day disable list by the Philadelphia 
Phillies following hemorrhoidal surgery. Ledee returned to the active roster 
on July 8, albeit the worse for wear. Ledee doubled in a game versus the 
Dodgers but went into 2nd base standing as a result of his inability to 
slide and possible aggravate his condition. Ledée retired from baseball 
on August 21, 2007. Ledée's late father, Toñito Ledée, was the lead singer 
of Papo Lucca's band, Sonora Ponceña. Ledee appeared in the For Love of 
the Game as a member of the New York Yankees named Ruiz. He also has a 
son, Ricky Ledée Jr., who lives on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.
