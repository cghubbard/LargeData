John E. "Scrappy" Carroll (August 27, 1860 – November 14, 1942) was an 
outfielder in Major League Baseball. He played for the St. Paul White Caps, 
Buffalo Bisons, and Cleveland Blues during the 1880s. Carroll stood 5 feet 
7 inches (1.70 m).[1] John E. Carroll was born in Buffalo, New York, in 
1860.[1] He was nicknamed "Scrappy", likely due to him having a "pugnacious 
disposition", and he may have been the first player to have had that nickname.[2] 
Carroll started his professional baseball career in 1884.[3] He played 
for the St. Paul Apostles of the Northwestern League during that season 
and made his major league debut with the Union Association's St. Paul White 
Caps on September 27. The White Caps played a total of nine games, and 
Carroll appeared in all of them, mostly as a right fielder. He went 3 for 
31 at the plate for a .097 batting average and made five errors in the 
field.[1] The Union Association disbanded after the 1884 season,[4] and 
in 1885, Carroll played for three different teams: the Western League's 
Cleveland Forest Cities, the Southern League's Memphis Reds, and the National 
League's Buffalo Bisons.[3] In his second major league trial, he played 
13 games for the Bisons and went 3 for 40 (.075).[1] In 1886, Carroll played 
for the Utica Pent Ups of the International League.[3] The following season, 
he received his final major league shot, with the American Association's 
Cleveland Blues. Carroll appeared in 57 games for the Blues and batted 
a career-high .199 with 19 runs batted in. He started in right field on 
August 3, which was Cleveland's first major league Sunday game. While playing 
for Cleveland, Carroll may have been the first major league player to wear 
sunglasses. According to an account of Cleveland's 1887 season, Carroll 
"caught the attention of the kranks at the ball park one sunny afternoon", 
when he wore "a pair of colored spectacles."[5] Carroll played in his final 
major league game on October 3 and finished his MLB career with a .171 
batting average in 79 games.[1] Carroll played for the Western Association's 
St. Paul Apostles in 1888 and 1889. In 1888, he batted .251 and led the 
team in at bats (494), runs (106), and total bases (205).[6] He also hit 
16 home runs, which led not only his team, but the entire league.[7] Carroll 
also had 85 stolen bases in 1888.[3] In 1890, Carroll played for the Western 
Association's Minneapolis Millers. The following season, he split his time 
between six different teams in the Western Association, New England League, 
and Eastern Association. Carroll's last year in professional baseball was 
1892.[3] That season, he played 42 games for the Western League's Minneapolis 
Minnies, batting .237 with a team-leading 14 stolen bases.[8] Carroll died 
in his hometown of Buffalo, New York, in 1942. He was buried in Mount Olivet
