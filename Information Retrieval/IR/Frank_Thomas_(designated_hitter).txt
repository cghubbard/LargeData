Frank Edward Thomas, Jr. (born May 27, 1968), nicknamed "The Big Hurt,"[1] 
is an American former first baseman in Major League Baseball who played 
for three American League (AL) teams from 1990 to 2008, all but the last 
three years with the Chicago White Sox. One of the most fearsome and devastating 
hitters of his era, he is the only player in major league history to have 
seven consecutive seasons (1991–1997) with a .300 batting average and at 
least 100 runs batted in (RBI), 100 runs scored, 100 walks and 20 home 
runs; over that period, he batted .330 and averaged 36 home runs and 118 
RBI per year. A perennial MVP candidate through the 1990s, he was named 
the AL's Most Valuable Player by unanimous vote in 1993 after becoming 
the first White Sox player to hit 40 home runs, leading the team to a division 
title; he repeated as MVP in the strike-shortened 1994 season after batting 
.353 and leading the league in slugging average and runs. After two subpar 
seasons, he lost the MVP in a close vote in 2000 after posting career highs 
of 43 home runs and 143 RBI, also earning AL Comeback Player of the Year 
honors, as Chicago finished with the AL's best record. A five-time All-Star, 
he won the AL batting title with a .347 mark in 1997, and enjoyed eleven 
seasons with 100 RBI and nine seasons each with a .300 average and 100 
runs. In his 30s, a variety of foot injuries and other minor ailments increasingly 
reduced his playing time and productivity, typically limiting him to a 
designated hitter role. In 2005, his final season in Chicago, he helped 
the White Sox to their first World Series title in 88 years. At the end 
of his career, he was tied for eighth in AL history in home runs (521), 
and was ninth in RBI (1,704) and sixth in walks (1,667); among players 
with at least 7,000 at bats in the AL, he ranked eighth in slugging average 
(.555) and ninth in on-base percentage (.419). With a .301 lifetime batting 
average, he became the seventh player in history to retire with a .300 
average and 500 home runs. He holds White Sox franchise records for career 
home runs (448), RBI (1,465), runs (1,327), doubles (447), extra base hits, 
walks (1,466), slugging average (.568) and on-base percentage (.427); his 
team record of 3,949 career total bases was broken by Paul Konerko in 2014. 
Thomas was one of the major stars who never fell under suspicion during 
the controversies over performance-enhancing drugs in the late 1990s, and 
was an advocate for drug testing as early as 1995; he was the only active 
player who agreed to be interviewed for the Mitchell Report in 2007. The 
White Sox retired his uniform number 35 in 2010, and unveiled a statue 
of him at U.S. Cellular Field in 2011. He is now a commentator for Comcast 
SportsNet White Sox broadcasts. Thomas was elected to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 2014 in his first year of eligibility, becoming the first White 
Sox star to achieve that distinction.[2] Thomas was born and raised in 
Columbus, Georgia, and attended Columbus High School, where he was a standout 
in both football and baseball. As a sophomore he hit cleanup for the baseball 
team, which won a state championship. As a senior he not only hit .440, 
but also was named an All-State tight end in football, and played forward 
with the basketball team. He wanted desperately to win a contract to play 
professional baseball, but was not selected in the 1986 amateur draft.[3] 
"I was shocked and sad", Thomas recalled in the Chicago Tribune. "I saw 
a lot of guys I played against get drafted, and I knew they couldn't do 
what I could do. But I've had people all my life saying you can't do this, 
you can't do that. It scars you. No matter how well I've done. People have 
misunderstood me for some reason. I was always one of the most competitive 
kids around."[3] In the autumn of 1986, Thomas accepted a scholarship to 
play football at Auburn University.[4] His love of baseball drew him to 
the school's baseball team, where the coach immediately recognized his 
potential. "We loved him", Auburn baseball coach Hal Baird told Sports 
Illustrated. "He was fun to be around—always smiling, always bright-eyed." 
He was also a deadly hitter, posting a .359 batting average and leading 
the Tigers in runs batted in as a freshman. During the summer of 1987 he 
played for the U.S. Pan American Team, earning a spot on the final roster 
that would compete in the Pan American Games. The Games coincided with 
the beginning of football practice back at Auburn, so he left the Pan Am 
team and returned to college—only to be injured twice in early season football 
games.[3] In the summer of 1988, Thomas played for the Orleans Cardinals 
of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Highlights included a 3-homer game in 
Wareham, as well as a home run over the 434' sign in center field at Eldredge 
Park in Orleans. Despite the injury that could have jeopardized his football 
scholarship, Auburn continued his funding, and baseball became his sole 
sport. He won consideration for the U.S. National Team – preparing for 
the 1988 Summer Olympics – but was cut from the final squad. By the end 
of his junior baseball season he had hit 19 home runs, 19 doubles, and 
batted .403 with a slugging percentage of .801. He earned Southeastern 
Conference MVP honors his senior year. Thomas concluded his college career 
with 49 home runs, a school record.[5] In May 2011, he was inducted into 
the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. The Chicago White Sox selected Thomas 
with the seventh pick in the first round of the June 1989 Major League 
Baseball draft. He made his major league debut on August 2, 1990 against 
the Milwaukee Brewers at County Stadium; he went without a hit, going 0 
for 4, but had an RBI on a fielder's choice which scored Iván Calderón 
as the White Sox won the game 4–3.[6] On August 28, Thomas hit the first 
home run of his career in a road game against the Minnesota Twins (coincidentally, 
he would hit his 500th career home run at the Metrodome). He hit the home 
run off pitcher Gary Wayne in the top of the ninth inning as his team lost 
12–6.[7] Thomas became known for his menacing home run power; in the on-deck 
circle, he routinely swung a rusted piece of rebar that he reportedly found 
during a renovation project in Old Comiskey Park.[8] In his first full 
season, Thomas established himself as a multi-talented hitter, combining 
power with hitting for average, drawing walks, and driving in runs. In 
1991, Thomas finished third in MVP voting with a .318 batting average, 
32 home runs and 109 runs batted in, as well as walking 138 times. He won 
the first of four Silver Slugger Awards, and led the league in on-base 
percentage, something he would accomplish four times during his career. 
In 1993, Thomas batted .317 with a club-record 41 homers, plus 128 RBI, 
106 runs scored, and 112 walks. He joined a quartet of Hall of Famers (Babe 
Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx and Ted Williams) as the only players in 
baseball history to eclipse .300 with more than 20 homers and more than 
100 RBI, runs, and walks in three straight seasons. On the back of this 
historic offensive output, Thomas collected all 28 votes from baseball 
writers for a unanimous AL Most Valuable Player award, the first by a White 
Sox player since Dick Allen in 1972, while leading the White Sox to their 
first AL West crown in 10 years. At the time, statistical analyst Bill 
James projected career statistics of 480 homers and a .311 lifetime average. 
Then-manager Gene Lamont was laudatory of Thomas' skills: "I've only seen 
him two years now, but I'm convinced that there isn't a pitch he can't 
hit."[citation needed] White Sox announcer Ken Harrelson echoed the praise, 
"In my 30 years in the game, I've never seen anyone like Big Hurt (Thomas). 
In another 30 years, we may be talking about Frank Thomas in the same way 
we talk about Ted Williams."[citation needed] Thomas credited Harrelson 
with coining the "Big Hurt" nickname.[9] In 1994, playing just 113 games 
due to a strike-shortened season, Thomas again put up huge offensive numbers 
recording 38 homers and 101 RBIs, batted .353, and led the league in runs 
scored (106), walks (109), and slugging percentage with a whopping .729 
mark. Thomas handily won his second consecutive MVP award, taking 24 of 
28 first-place votes. He is one of only three first basemen in history 
to win consecutive MVP awards in the major leagues (Hall of Famer Jimmie 
Foxx, 1932–1933, and Albert Pujols, 2008–2009, are the others). The 1994 
shortened season was due to a players' strike, and perhaps no one felt 
the sting of the strike more than Thomas, who stood poised to achieve one 
of baseball's most prestigious honors: the Triple Crown. Not since 1967 
had any player finished the regular season first in average, home runs, 
and runs batted in. Thomas had recorded 32 home runs at the All-Star break, 
and was contending for the honor when the strike occurred. Pressed by the 
media to comment on his accomplishments—and his future—Thomas downplayed 
his own significance, telling the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: "I'm not 
into being known as the best by fans or the media. I care how I'm perceived 
by my peers. I can settle for the label 'one of the best' because that 
means you're considered an elite player."[3] Thomas would continue putting 
up significant well-rounded offensive numbers, always placing in the top 
finishers in all major offensive categories, though rarely leading in any 
one stat. In 1995 he hit .308 with 40 homers and 111 RBI; in 1996 he hit 
.349 with 40 home runs and 134 RBI, and became an All-Star for the fourth 
time while finishing 8th in MVP voting. From 1991 to 1997, Thomas finished 
in the top 10 of the MVP voting every year. In 1997, Thomas won the batting 
title and finished third in MVP voting. However, due in part to personal 
strife off the field, his offensive production wavered during the next 
two seasons. Never a defensive standout at first base during the early 
part of his career, Thomas nonetheless preferred playing in the field to 
serving as a designated hitter, saying that it kept him focused; the fact 
that he did generally hit better as a first baseman created a dilemma over 
the years for the White Sox as to whether to use him as a DH, which would 
reduce wear on his body but might cost some offensive production. By the 
late 1990s, minor injuries were tending to keep him unavailable for short 
periods, and 1997 was the last year in which he played more in the field 
than as a DH. Thomas rebounded with force in 2000 when he hit .328 with 
a career-high 43 homers and 143 runs batted in. Thomas finished second 
in MVP voting that season, behind Jason Giambi of the Oakland Athletics. 
Thomas also won the 2000 AL Comeback Player of the Year Award. But this 
would not mean an end to the rocky path he would follow later in his career. 
In 2001, after his father died, Thomas also announced during the same week 
that he would undergo season-ending surgery after an MRI revealed a triceps 
tear in his right arm. He was distraught from the combined impact of both 
personal and professional strife. "This is the worst week of my life", 
he said during a press conference in Chicago. "First I lose my father, 
then come back and find out I'm lost for the season." He only played in 
20 games that year.[10] He rebounded from his injury and played in 148 
games in 2002, but hit just .252, a career-low for a complete season, and 
would never again approach a .300 batting average. But his power and ability 
to get on base and drive in runs were still in his offensive arsenal. Always 
a patient hitter, Thomas led the AL in walks four times. Through the end 
of the 2006 season, he was second among all active players in walks and 
third in on-base percentage, and ranked among the top 20 lifetime in both 
categories. Thomas had another solid season in 2003. He tied for second 
in the AL in home runs (42), and was in the league's top ten in walks, 
extra base hits, slugging average, and on-base plus slugging, as he led 
the major leagues in fly ball percentage (54.9%). In 2005, Thomas again 
suffered injury, but hit 12 home runs in 105 at bats over 35 games, demonstrating 
his continued power at the plate. Adding together 2004 and 2005, he had 
fewer than 350 total at bats because of injuries, but hit 30 home runs 
and drew 80 walks. As a member of the White Sox, Thomas and teammate Magglio 
Ordóñez tied a major league record for back-to-back homers, with six in 
one season. In 2005, manager Ozzie Guillén led the White Sox to a World 
Series victory, their first in 88 years. Thomas was not on the post-season 
roster of the Series-winning team due to injury, but the team honored his 
perennial contributions to the franchise during Game 1 of the Division 
Series against the Boston Red Sox. Thomas was chosen to throw out the ceremonial 
first pitch. "What a feeling", Thomas said. "Standing [ovation] all around 
the place. People really cheering me. I had tears in my eyes. To really 
know the fans cared that much about me – it was a great feeling. One of 
my proudest moments in the game."[11] The White Sox honored him by giving 
him a World Series ring for his contributions to the franchise. Thomas 
established several White Sox batting records, including all-time leader 
in runs scored (1,327), home runs (448), doubles (447), RBI (1,465), extra-base 
hits (906), walks (1,466), total bases (3,949), slugging percentage (.568), 
and on-base percentage (.427). At the time he left the team, his 448 home 
runs were more than twice as many as any other individual player had hit 
for the White Sox in their 105-year history. Despite his perennial offensive 
production and established fan base in Chicago, the White Sox elected to 
release Thomas in 2005. Thomas later expressed disappointment with how 
his 16-year tenure with the White Sox was ended, saying that chairman Jerry 
Reinsdorf did not call him to tell him he wasn’t coming back. He also said 
that he and Kenny Williams did not see eye-to-eye after Williams became 
general manager following the 2000 season. At the time, Thomas was unhappy 
that his next-to-last deal with the White Sox contained a "diminished skills" 
clause. He said the White Sox should have traded him after the playoffs 
that season. "I've got a lot of respect for Jerry Reinsdorf, I do. But 
I really thought, the relationship we had over the last 16 years, he would 
have picked up the phone to say, 'Big guy, we're moving forward. We're 
going somewhere different. We don't know your situation or what's going 
to happen.' I can live with that, I really can", Thomas said. "But treating 
me like some passing-by-player. I've got no respect for that." Thomas said 
he was not bitter or angry and had joined the A's with an open mind.[12] 
Thomas signed with the Oakland Athletics to a one-year, $500,000 deal with 
incentives on January 26, 2006.[13] The Athletics installed Thomas as their 
everyday DH. He started the season slowly, but ended the season as the 
team leader in home runs, RBI, slugging percentage, and on-base percentage. 
He provided a powerful right-handed bat in the middle of the lineup for 
the division-leading Athletics. He had a stretch where he hit a home run 
in six straight games. On May 22, 2006, Thomas homered twice in his first 
game against his former team. Before Thomas came up to lead off the second 
inning, a musical montage played on the Jumbotron at U.S. Cellular Field, 
paying tribute to Thomas's legacy with the White Sox. He was cheered in 
his introduction by the White Sox fans. Moments later, when he hit his 
first home run of the night to put his former team behind in the score 
1–0, the Chicago crowd gave Thomas a standing ovation. Thomas rejuvenated 
his career playing with the Athletics, placing fifth in the American League 
with 39 HRs and eighth with 114 RBI.[14] He also was key to the team's 
stretch drive to the playoffs: for the week ending September 10, he was 
the league's player of the week after hitting .462 with five homers and 
13 RBI.[15] The 2006 postseason provided Thomas the opportunity to play 
in his first postseason games since 2000 due to having missed the 2005 
playoffs with an injury, when the Athletics clinched the American League 
West title, defeating the Seattle Mariners 12–3 on September 26. During 
the A's first playoff game on October 3, Thomas hit two solo home runs, 
leading the A's to a 3–2 win over the Twins. His performance during the 
opening playoff game earned Thomas the distinction of being the oldest 
player to hit multiple home runs in a postseason game. He led the A's to 
an ALDS victory, going 5 for 10 with 2 home runs. On October 7, 2006, he 
finished behind Jim Thome, his replacement as the White Sox's DH, in the 
voting for the AL Comeback Player of the Year Award. He was awarded the 
AL players' choice award for Comeback Player. He finished 4th in the vote 
for the MVP award.[14] On November 16, 2006 Thomas signed a 2-year, $18 million 
contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. According to BlueJays.com, Thomas 
was scheduled to make $1 million (US) in the first season (with a $9.12 million 
signing bonus) and $8 million in the next season. The contract included 
an option for 2009 contingent on his reaching 1,050 plate appearances over 
the next two seasons or 525 plate appearances in the second year of the 
contract.[16] On June 17, 2007, Thomas hit his 496th career home run, giving 
him his 244th home run as a DH, breaking the record previously held by 
Edgar Martínez. On June 28, 2007, Thomas hit the 500th home run of his 
career, becoming the 21st major league player to do so. It was a three-run 
shot off Minnesota's Carlos Silva (Thomas' 500th home run came on the same 
day Craig Biggio hit his 3,000th career hit). Despite Thomas being a player 
for the visiting team in the game, the Metrodome scoreboard still paid 
notice to his achievement. He was later ejected from this same game.[17] 
On September 17, 2007, Thomas hit three home runs in his team's 6–1 win 
over the Red Sox. It was the second time in his career that Thomas hit 
three home runs in a game, the first time also having been against the 
Red Sox on September 15, 1996 in a White Sox loss.[18][19] Knuckleballer 
Tim Wakefield started both games for the Red Sox, and gave up five of the 
six home runs Thomas hit, including all three in the first game. During 
spring training in 2008, Thomas expressed his confidence about his team's 
chances for the upcoming season. Thomas hit his first home run of the season 
against the Red Sox on April 5, in a 10–2 Blue Jays win. The following 
day, with the bases loaded and a 2–2 tie, Thomas hit a grand slam off Red 
Sox reliever Manny Delcarmen, leading the Jays to a 7–4 victory. On April 
19, before a game against the Detroit Tigers, manager John Gibbons benched 
Thomas. Thomas expressed his frustration about the decision, and vowed 
that his career would "not end like this."[20] On April 20, 2008, the Blue 
Jays released Thomas. Four days later, the Athletics and Thomas agreed 
to terms for his return.[21] In his final game with the Athletics on August 
29, he went 2 for 4. After playing 55 games with Oakland due to time on 
the disabled list, Thomas hit five more home runs to bring his career total 
to 521, while posting a .263 batting average.[22] On October 31, 2008 he 
became a free agent. On February 12, 2010, Thomas signed a one-day contract 
with the White Sox before announcing his retirement after not playing in 
the 2009 season.[23] During the same press conference, the White Sox, for 
whom he played the first 16 seasons of his career, announced that they 
would retire his No. 35 on August 29.[24] Thomas is the only player in 
major league history to have seven consecutive seasons of a .300 average 
and at least 100 walks, 100 runs, 100 runs batted in, and 20 home runs 
(from 1991 to 1997).[5] The only other player to have more than five consecutive 
seasons accomplishing this feat was Ted Williams, with six.[5] This accomplishment 
is even more remarkable considering that Thomas played only 113 games in 
1994 due to the strike. There are only five other players in history who 
have both hit more home runs and have a higher career batting average than 
Thomas: Hank Aaron, Jimmie Foxx, Babe Ruth, Manny Ramirez, and Willie Mays.[25] 
As early as 1995, Thomas was advocating drug testing for professional baseball 
players.[26] After hitting his 500th home run, Thomas stated, "It means 
a lot to me because I did it the right way", alluding to Barry Bonds's 
then-ongoing pursuit of Hank Aaron's career home run record.[27] Thomas 
was, then, the only active baseball player to be interviewed during the 
preparation of the Mitchell Report. He did so voluntarily. The White Sox 
announced that they would honor Thomas with a life-size bronze statue. 
It was unveiled on Sunday, July 31, 2011, on the outfield concourse at 
U.S. Cellular Field. It is the eighth statue on the outfield concourse. 
Thomas was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014 with 83.7% 
of the vote in his initial year of eligibility, and was inducted as a member 
of the White Sox on July 27, 2014.[31] He is the first, and so far only, 
player inducted into the Hall of Fame who played more games as a designated 
hitter than as a position player. Thomas appeared in the movie Mr. Baseball 
(as a hot-prospect rookie wearing #68 named Ricky Davis who forces Tom 
Selleck's character off the Yankees roster) and made a guest appearance 
(as himself) on the TV show Married... with Children. In 1995, a baseball 
video game titled Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball was developed by Acclaim 
Entertainment and released for various platforms, with All-Star Baseball 
'97 Featuring Frank Thomas following in 1997. Also in 1995, Premier Technologies 
created a pinball machine (marketed under the Gottlieb trade name) titled 
Frank Thomas' Big Hurt;[32] Thomas made an appearance in the documentary 
The History of Pinball in which he discusses the similarities between playing 
baseball and pinball. Frank Thomas' Big Hurt was later added to pinball 
video game The Pinball Arcade in late July 2016.[33] In 2007, he appeared 
in a promotional advertisement for the Blue Jays, in which he engages in 
a pillow fight with children. This ad drew the criticism of the Television 
Bureau of Canada, who requested a "Dramatization. Do not try this at home." 
disclaimer be placed on the ad. A similar warning was placed on teammate 
A. J. Burnett's commercial.[34] The Blue Jays, humorously, then scheduled 
a "Frank Thomas Kid's Pillow" promotion for September 2, 2007.[35] Thomas 
appeared as a guest analyst during TBS's coverage of the 2007 MLB playoffs. 
Since 2010, Thomas has continued his work with Comcast SportsNet Chicago 
by serving as a Studio analyst during their pre-game and post-game Chicago 
White Sox broadcasts. He also is a substitute color analyst for the Chicago 
White Sox Comcast SportsNet Chicago broadcasts and WGN broadcasts, temporarily 
filling in for Steve Stone on occasion. In 2012, Thomas participated in 
the Pepsi MAX Field of Dreams game in Columbus, Ohio. He batted cleanup 
and helped the Legends team win the ballgame.[36] In 2013, Thomas participated 
in the Pepsi MAX Field of Dreams game in Rochester, New York.[37] In 2014, 
Thomas joined Fox Sports as a studio analyst for MLB on Fox. Currently, 
Frank Thomas serves as CEO and Founder of W2W Records, a record label based 
in Las Vegas, Nevada. Thomas brews his own microbrew, Big Hurt Beer, sold 
at the Chicago-area liquor store chain Binny's Beverage Depot. In 2014, 
Thomas opened a brewpub, Big Hurt's Brewhouse, in the Chicago suburb of
