David Américo Ortiz Arias (born November 18, 1975), nicknamed "Big Papi", 
is a Dominican American retired professional baseball player. Ortiz was 
a designated hitter (DH) in Major League Baseball (MLB) who occasionally 
played first base. He played for the Minnesota Twins from 1997 to 2002 
and the Boston Red Sox from 2003 to 2016. Ortiz was a ten-time All-Star, 
a three-time World Series champion, seven-time Silver Slugger winner, and 
he holds the Red Sox single-season record for home runs with 54, set during 
the 2006 season. Born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Ortiz was originally 
signed by the Seattle Mariners on November 28, 1992, but was traded to 
the Minnesota Twins in 1996. He made his major league debut on September 
2, 1997 for the Twins. After parts of 6 seasons in Minnesota, Ortiz was 
released by the Twins and signed with the Boston Red Sox. In Boston, Ortiz 
established himself as one of the most powerful sluggers of all time. He 
was instrumental in the team ending its 86-year World Series championship 
drought in 2004, as well as during successful championship runs in 2007 
and 2013. He was the MVP of the 2013 World Series. Ortiz finished his career 
with 541 home runs, which ranks 17th on the MLB all-time home run list, 
1,768 RBIs (22nd all-time) and a .286 batting average. Among designated 
hitters, he is the all-time leader in MLB history for home runs (485), 
runs batted in (RBIs) (1,569), and hits (2,192). Regarded as one of the 
best clutch hitters of all time, Ortiz had 11 career walk-off home runs 
during the regular season and 2 during the postseason. Ortiz was born in 
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic on November 18, 1975 as the oldest of 
four children to Enrique (Leo) Ortiz and Angela Rosa Arias. As a boy, he 
followed the careers of standout pitcher Ramon Martinez and his younger 
brother Pedro, attending games whenever he could and building a friendship 
with Pedro that would only grow over the years. He graduated from Estudia 
Espaillat High School in the Dominican Republic, and was a standout baseball 
and basketball player there. On November 28, 1992, Ortiz was signed by 
the Seattle Mariners just 10 days after his 17th birthday, who listed him 
as "David Arias". He made his professional debut in 1994 for the Mariners 
of the Arizona League, batting .246 with 2 home runs and 20 RBI. By 1995, 
he had improved those numbers to .332 with 4 home runs and 37 RBI. In 1996, 
he was promoted to the Single-A Wisconsin Timber Rattlers of the Midwest 
League, a Mariners farm team. He established himself as one of the Mariners' 
best hitting prospects, batting .322 with 18 home runs and 93 RBI. Ortiz 
also impressed fans and Mariners' players like Alex Rodriguez alike with 
a strong performance in an impromptu home run derby[1] that took place 
following a failed Mariners' promotion where the Timber Rattlers were supposed 
to have played an exhibition game against the MLB club in front of their 
home fans in Wisconsin (the game was rained out). Also in Wisconsin, Ortiz 
met his future wife Tiffany, who led David to become a fan of the nearby 
Green Bay Packers NFL team, a devotion that would become lifelong. Baseball 
America named Ortiz the most exciting player in the Midwest League, as 
well as its best defensive first baseman for 1996. Despite his strong year 
in the Mariners' system, on September 13, 1996, David was traded to the 
Minnesota Twins as the player to be named later to complete an earlier 
transaction for Dave Hollins. When he arrived in Minnesota, he informed 
the team that he preferred to be listed as "David Ortiz" - using his paternal 
family name rather than "Arias" which was his maternal family name. Ortiz 
rose quickly through the Twins system in 1997. Though he started with the 
High-A Fort Myers Miracle, he quickly progressed through Double-A (New 
Britain Rock Cats), to the Triple-A Salt Lake Buzz. At the three levels, 
Ortiz combined to hit .317 with 31 home runs and 124 RBI, earning a September 
call-up to the Twins' MLB club. Ortiz made his Major League debut for the 
Twins on September 2, 1997. He got into 15 games in September, batting 
.327 in 49 at bats. He recorded his first major league hit in his second 
game, on September 3, with an eighth inning pinch-hit double against the 
Chicago Cubs. He hit his first major league home run on September 14 against 
the Texas Rangers, off pitcher Julio Santana, going 3-for-4 with two walks 
in the game overall. In 49 at bats, Ortiz batted .327 with 1 home run and 
6 RBI. In 1998, Ortiz entered the season with his sights set on playing 
as the regular first baseman for the Twins. However, Ortiz's playing style 
was somewhat different than the approach favored by manager Tom Kelly, 
which placed a premium on avoiding strikeouts, and great defense (which 
Kelly felt Ortiz still needed to work on).[2] While Kelly worked with Ortiz 
on his defense, he hit well, batting .306 through May 9 before fracturing 
his wrist and going on the disabled list. He returned to the Twins in July 
following a rehab assignment to Triple-A, and finished the season with 
the team. He ended his rookie year strong, batting .360 in September. All 
told, he hit .277 with 9 home runs and 46 RBI in 86 games. In 1999, Ortiz 
figured to be a fixture in the lineup, but after a tough spring training 
which saw him bat only .137, he was sent down to the Triple-A Salt Lake 
Buzz as the sure-handed rookie Doug Mientkiewicz earned the first base 
job. It was becoming apparent that manager Tom Kelly preferred veteran 
players or those who fit into his small-ball and good defense philosophy, 
something Ortiz would later be vocal about after his days with the Twins.[3] 
While Ortiz tore through minor league pitching to the tune of a .315 average 
with 30 home runs and 110 RBI, Twins first basemen would go on to hit just 
.245 with 11 homers and 69 RBI all season. Twins designated hitters did 
not fare much better, batting a combined .259 with 14 home runs and 82 
RBI. Ortiz's strong season in Triple-A was too much for even Kelly to ignore, 
so Ortiz again earned a September call-up in 1999, but it did not go well, 
as David struck out 12 times in 20 at bats, and did not register a hit. 
By 2000, with the Twins annually languishing in the standings, Ortiz's 
bat could not be buried in the minor leagues much longer. After playing 
only sparingly during the seasons first two months, by June 2000 he finally 
established himself as an MLB regular. However, Ortiz played primarily 
at designated hitter as manager Kelly stuck with the veteran Ron Coomer 
at first base. When Ortiz homered on June 9 against the Milwaukee Brewers, 
it was his first MLB home run in more than a year. On September 7, he hit 
his first major league grand slam at Fenway Park against Boston Red Sox 
pitcher Ramon Martinez, one of his childhood heroes from the Dominican 
Republic. As his playing time increased, his stats improved. Despite his 
slow start, he finished at .282 with 10 home runs and 63 RBI. His 36 doubles 
were second on the team to Matt Lawton's 44, despite Ortiz having almost 
200 fewer plate appearances. David's .364 on base percentage was fourth 
on the team among players with more than 100 plate appearances. Ortiz began 
the 2001 season as the regular DH and started the year strong, batting 
.311 with 6 home runs and 18 RBI through May 4. For the first time in years, 
the Twins were a contender thanks to a hot start helped by Ortiz's hitting. 
However, another wrist fracture landed Ortiz back on the disabled list, 
and he did not return until July. It was apparent the injury affected his 
production, as he batted just .202 upon his return. He finished the year 
with a disappointing .234 average, however, the 11 home runs he hit over 
the season's final two months (including his first multihomer game on September 
5 against the Texas Rangers) offered a glimmer of hope for the future. 
Despite their hot start, the Twins ultimately did not qualify for the postseason, 
but did win a very respectable 85 games. It was the franchise's first winning 
season since 1992. At the end of the season, longtime Twins manager Tom 
Kelly retired, and Ron Gardenhire took over the reins. The offseason proved 
very difficult for Ortiz, as on New Year's Day 2002, his mother passed 
away following a car accident. Gardenhire reached out and helped Ortiz 
deal with the tragic death, and Ortiz prepared hard for the coming baseball 
season, both saddened his mother never saw him play at his best[4] and 
determined to reach new heights. When the season began, Ortiz battled knee 
injuries. It was a tale of two seasons for David, as his .240 average with 
5 homers and 33 RBI before the All-Star break was disappointing. But after 
the All-Star break, Ortiz quietly turned in one of the better second halves 
in baseball, batting .297 with 15 home runs and 42 RBI. On August 16, he 
hit a memorable home run off his friend Pedro Martinez at the Hubert H. 
Humphrey Metrodome, hitting an inside cut fastball into the upper deck. 
On September 25, he hit the first walk-off home run of his career, against 
the Cleveland Indians. He finished the 2002 season batting .272 with 20 
home runs and 75 RBI. At this point in his career, the home run and RBI 
totals were both career bests. However, as he batted only .203 against 
left handed pitching, Ortiz still was not always guaranteed to start if 
a tough lefty would be on the mound. His career year coincided with the 
Twins qualifying for the postseason, as the team won 94 games and upset 
the Oakland Athletics in the Division Series before falling in the 2002 
American League Championship Series to the eventual World Series winning 
Anaheim Angels. Ortiz batted .276 in his first postseason, with 4 RBI. 
His 9th inning double in the decisive Game 5 of the Division Series put 
the Twins ahead 5-1 in a game they would hold on to win 5-4. The series 
winning RBI was the first of what would be many clutch postseason hits 
in Ortiz's career. After the season, the small market Twins faced a decision 
on Ortiz. David, who had made $950,000 in 2002, was due a raise to around 
$2 million for 2003. Rather than negotiate a contract, or go to arbitration, 
the Twins instead decided to release Ortiz as a cost-cutting move on December 
16, after finding themselves unable to find a team willing to trade for 
him.[5][6][7] In parts of six seasons totaling 455 games with the Twins, 
Ortiz hit 58 home runs and had 238 RBIs.[8] Ironically, the player who 
replaced Ortiz on the Twins' roster, Jose Morban, would never play in a 
game for the team. Ortiz took the news of his release from the Twins hard. 
He had just had his second child in 2001, and now worried he might be out 
of baseball. However, Ortiz had a chance encounter with Pedro Martinez 
at a restaurant in the Dominican Republic, and Martinez remembered the 
impressive home run he had given up to Ortiz in August 2002. Excited at 
the prospect of his friend joining him on the Boston Red Sox (who, coincidentally, 
needed a first baseman), Pedro began calling several Red Sox team officials 
to request that the team sign Ortiz.[9] On January 22, Ortiz signed a non-guaranteed 
free agent contract with the Red Sox that would be worth $1.25 million 
if he made the team. New Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein envisioned 
Ortiz as one of several candidates to fill a void at first base. Competition 
was fierce, as the team had a logjam of players who could play the position 
or at designated hitter. Sabermetrics favorite Jeremy Giambi was widely 
expected to get most of the playing time, but also in the mix were primary 
third baseman Bill Mueller (who figured to DH at times), Shea Hillenbrand 
(who could play third base, first base, or DH), and Kevin Millar (who could 
play first base or outfield). The team's best hitter, outfielder Manny 
Ramirez, figured to DH at times also. When the season started, all of them 
made the team, including Ortiz. Because of the logjam, Ortiz did not play 
steadily during the first two months of the season. He hit his first home 
run with his new team on April 27 at Anaheim, a go-ahead shot to break 
a 14th inning tie in an eventual 6-4 win, but batted only .212 in April. 
By May, he had raised his average to .272. Ortiz became frustrated over 
his limited playing time, seeing a similarity to what had happened to him 
in Minnesota, especially considering that Jeremy Giambi was only batting 
.125 on May 1. After expressing his frustration to the media, Pedro Martinez 
pulled his friend aside to defuse the situation, then asked manager Grady 
Little to ensure Ortiz always be in the lineup when he was pitching.[9] 
As Ortiz's bat heated up in May, the Red Sox finally broke the logjam when 
they traded Shea Hillenbrand to the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 29. On 
June 1, manager Grady Little benched Giambi, who was still hitting only 
.185. These two moves allowed Ortiz to become the everyday Designated Hitter. 
As a regular, Ortiz finally had the breakout year he had envisioned. After 
hitting .299 with 10 home runs in the season's first half, he turned on 
the power in the second half, hitting 21 home runs in 63 games. On July 
26, he delivered a walk-off hit against the rival New York Yankees. He 
would add his first walk-off homer as a member of the Red Sox on September 
23, against the Baltimore Orioles. He finished the season with 31 home 
runs, 101 RBIs and a .288 average, finishing fifth in the American League 
MVP voting as the Red Sox won the AL Wild Card and qualified for the postseason. 
In the 2003 postseason, Ortiz struggled in the ALDS against the Oakland 
A's until Game 4, when he hit a two-run double in the bottom of the eighth 
inning off closer Keith Foulke to turn a 4-3 deficit into a 5-4 Red Sox 
lead and eventual victory. In Game 1 of the ALCS against the rival New 
York Yankees, Ortiz hit his first career postseason home run. He finished 
with 2 home runs and 6 RBIs in the ALCS, including a solo home run in the 
eighth inning of the decisive Game 7 that gave the Red Sox a 5-2 lead at 
the time. However, the Red Sox would go on to blow the lead in the bottom 
of the inning, and Boston lost the series in heartbreaking fashion on Aaron 
Boone's infamous extra-inning walkoff home run that instead sent the Yankees 
to the 2003 World Series. In the offseason, Ortiz was eligible for salary 
arbitration once again, but the Red Sox agreed with him on a $4.6 million 
salary for the 2004 season, avoiding hearings. Prior to the agreement, 
Ortiz and his agent had submitted a figure of $5 million, while the Red 
Sox had countered with $4.2 million, so the agreement split the difference.[10] 
Once the 2004 season started, Ortiz wasted no time picking up right where 
he left off with the bat. On May 28, Ortiz hit his 100th career home run, 
a grand slam, off Joel Piñeiro of the Seattle Mariners at Fenway Park. 
Also in May, Ortiz signed a two-year contract extension with the Red Sox 
worth $12.5 million.[11] He batted .304 with 23 home runs and 78 RBI in 
the season's first half, was named an All-Star for the first time in his 
career, and hit a long home run in the All-Star Game off Carl Pavano. Ortiz 
was suspended for three games in July, after being ejected following an 
incident in a July 16 game against the Angels in which he threw several 
bats onto the field that came close to hitting umpires Bill Hohn and Mark 
Carlson. Ortiz finished the 2004 season with 41 home runs and 139 RBIs 
while batting .301 with an on base plus slugging (OPS) of .983. He finished 
second in the American League in both home runs and RBIs, and finished 
fourth in American League MVP voting. He also earned his first Silver Slugger 
award for his outstanding performance at Designated Hitter. In addition, 
Ortiz and teammate Manny Ramirez became the first pair of AL teammates 
to hit 40 home runs, have 100 RBIs, and bat .300 since the Yankees' Babe 
Ruth and Lou Gehrig in 1931.[12] Together they hit back-to-back home runs 
six times, tying the major league single-season mark set by the Detroit 
Tigers' Hank Greenberg and Rudy York and later matched by the Chicago White 
Sox's Frank Thomas and Magglio Ordóñez.[12] The duo quickly became arguably 
the best hitting tandem of the decade. In the 2004 postseason, Ortiz elevated 
his play to a new level. He had multiple game-winning hits to help Boston 
advance through the rounds. In the 2004 ALDS, he hit a series winning walk-off 
home run off Jarrod Washburn in the 10th inning of Game 3 to knock out 
the Anaheim Angels. In the ALCS against the New York Yankees, the Red Sox 
quickly fell behind 0 games to 3, a deficit that had never been surmounted 
in baseball history. Ortiz almost singlehandedly paved the way for history, 
as he hit a walk-off two-run home run against Paul Quantrill in the 12th 
inning of Game 4 and a walk-off single off of Esteban Loaiza in the 14th 
inning of Game 5. His heroics - namely batting .387 with 3 home runs and 
11 RBI in the series - earned him MVP honors, the first time a DH had ever 
won that award, as the Red Sox came back to win in 7 games. In the World 
Series vs. the St. Louis Cardinals, Ortiz set the tone for the four game 
sweep as he hit a three-run home run off of Woody Williams in the 1st inning 
of Game 1 at Fenway Park. He hit .308 in the series with 1 home run and 
4 RBI as the Red Sox swept the Cardinals to end the Curse of the Bambino 
by winning their first World Series Championship in 86 years. Overall, 
Ortiz batted .400 in the 2004 postseason with 5 home runs and 23 RBIs. 
In 2005, Ortiz set new career highs with 47 home runs and 148 RBIs. He 
batted .300 with an OPS of 1.001. On June 2, his three-run homer turned 
a 4-3 deficit into a 6-4 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. On September 
6, his 38th home run of the year beat the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. 
On September 29, his eighth inning home run against the Toronto Blue Jays 
tied the game at 4, then his ninth inning single in his very next at-bat 
gave Boston the win. For all of his late inning heroics, Red Sox ownership 
would present Ortiz with a plaque proclaiming him "the greatest clutch-hitter 
in the history of the Boston Red Sox".[13][14] He led the American League 
in RBIs, while finishing second in home runs and third in OPS. Ortiz finished 
second in the American League MVP voting[15] to Alex Rodriguez while leading 
the Red Sox to their third consecutive playoff appearance, where they lost 
in the first round to the eventual champion White Sox. For the second consecutive 
season, Ortiz was named an All-Star, and won the Silver Slugger Award. 
He also won his first Hank Aaron Award as the outstanding hitter in the 
American League. The 2006 season was another banner year for Ortiz. On 
April 10, the Red Sox announced Ortiz signed a four-year, $52 million contract 
extension with the team.[11] The contract also included a team option for 
a fifth year. His clutch hitting continued. Over the two months of June 
and July, he had five walkoff hits, three of which were home runs. Ortiz 
hit his 200th career home run on June 29, against Duaner Sánchez of the 
New York Mets at Fenway Park. He posted his best month of the season in 
July, batting .339 with 14 home runs. On September 20 at Fenway Park, Ortiz 
tied Jimmie Foxx's single season Red Sox home run record of 50 set in 1938, 
in the sixth inning against Minnesota Twins' Boof Bonser. On September 
21, Ortiz broke the record by hitting his 51st home run off Johan Santana 
of the Twins. The home run was also his 44th of the season as a Designated 
Hitter, breaking his own American League single-season record. Ortiz finished 
2006 with a career high 54 home runs to set a new Red Sox record, and had 
137 RBIs while batting .287 with an OPS of 1.049. He led the American League 
in both home runs and RBIs and finished third in OPS. He finished third 
in the American League MVP voting behind Justin Morneau and Derek Jeter. 
Despite his outstanding campaign, however, the Red Sox did not qualify 
for the postseason. In 2007, Ortiz was instrumental in leading the Red 
Sox to their seventh World Series title. In the regular season, he had 
35 home runs and 117 RBIs while batting a career best .332, placing him 
in the top 10 in the American League in all three categories. In addition, 
he hit 52 doubles, led the American League in extra base hits and finished 
second in OPS at 1.066. His .445 on base percentage led the league. An 
All-Star for the fourth consecutive season, Ortiz finished fourth in the 
American League MVP voting and captured the Silver Slugger at DH once again, 
as the Red Sox won the AL East. In the postseason, Ortiz again kept up 
the clutch hitting. He batted .714 (5-for-7) against the Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim in the Division Series, with 2 home runs. Then, after batting 
.292 with a home run against the Cleveland Indians in the 2007 American 
League Championship Series, he hit .333 in the 2007 World Series, with 
4 RBI. Combined, Ortiz batted .370 with 3 home runs and 10 RBIs as Boston 
swept the Colorado Rockies to win their second World Series Championship 
in four years. In 2008, Ortiz started slowly after suffering a wrist injury 
which caused him to miss several weeks. He played in a total of 109 games 
and finished the season with 23 home runs and 89 RBIs while batting .264. 
Despite his struggles, Ortiz was named to his fifth All-Star team. In the 
playoffs, Ortiz batted just .186 over two rounds as the Red Sox ultimately 
fell to the Tampa Bay Rays in the 2008 American League Championship Series. 
Ortiz struggled early in the 2009 season, hitting only .206 with no home 
runs and 30 strikeouts in his first 34 games. He did not hit his first 
home run of the season until May 22 off Brett Cecil of the Toronto Blue 
Jays, ending a career-high 178 homerless at-bat streak.[16] In June, Ortiz 
broke out of his slump by hitting 7 home runs with 22 RBI. He hit 7 home 
runs in each of July and August, including the 300th of his career against 
Luke Hochevar of the Kansas City Royals at Fenway Park on July 9. On September 
17, Ortiz hit his 270th career home run as a DH off José Arredondo of the 
Los Angeles Angels, breaking the all-time record held by Frank Thomas. 
However, Ortiz finished the season with just a .238 average to go along 
with his 28 home runs and 99 RBIs. He also struggled in the postseason, 
with just one hit in 12 at-bats. During 2009, Ortiz did, however, play 
first base for the first time since the 2007 season. In 2010, Ortiz again 
got off to a slow start, and questions loomed large about his future.[17] 
Ortiz batted just .143 in April, with 1 home run and 4 RBI. But Ortiz returned 
to his All-Star form beginning with a hot May, and finished at .270 with 
32 home runs and 102 RBIs for the year. His home run and RBI totals were 
both in the top 10 in the American League. At the All-Star Game, Ortiz 
won the Home Run Derby contest, defeating Florida Marlins shortstop Hanley 
Ramírez in the final. A strong September where Ortiz drove in 23 runs pushed 
him over the 100-RBI mark for the first time in three seasons. But despite 
Ortiz's resurgence, the Red Sox finished third in the AL East and failed 
to qualify for the postseason. At the end of the season, the Red Sox announced 
that they would pick up the $12.5 team option on his contract for 2011,[18] 
though Ortiz had hoped for a multi-year extension instead. In 2011, Ortiz 
continued to produce, batting .309 with 29 home runs and 96 RBIs. He passed 
several milestones during the year. On April 2, he set the record for RBIs 
by a designated hitter with 1,004, surpassing Edgar Martínez. Then, on 
May 21, Ortiz became only the fifth player to hit 300 home runs as a member 
of the Red Sox, joining Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, and Dwight 
Evans. On July 15, Ortiz was suspended for 4 games for his part in a brawl 
that took place on July 8 in a game against the Baltimore Orioles. Ortiz 
charged Orioles pitcher Kevin Gregg after a brushback pitch and an exchange 
of words, triggering a bench-clearing brawl. In 2011, Ortiz made his seventh 
All-Star Team. He also earned his fifth Silver Slugger Award at the end 
of the year, and, on October 20, Major League Baseball announced that Ortiz 
was the winner of the Roberto Clemente Award. However, the Red Sox again 
failed to qualify for the postseason. Also at season's end, as Ortiz and 
the Red Sox could not agree on a contract extension during the year, Ortiz 
headed for free agency for the first time since being released by the Twins 
in 2003. However, on December 7, he accepted the Red Sox offer of salary 
arbitration, and the two sides again avoided hearings by agreeing to a 
$14.575 million figure for the 2012 season.[19] 2012 began like Ortiz had 
his sights set on MVP contention again, as he hit .405 over the season's 
first month, with 6 home runs and 20 RBI. On July 4, at O.co Coliseum in 
Oakland, Ortiz hit his 400th career home run off of A. J. Griffin of the 
Oakland Athletics. However, on July 16, Ortiz suffered an injury to his 
right Achilles tendon and was placed on the DL on July 19. He returned 
on August 24, but returned to the DL on August 27 after playing just 1 
game. He finished the season with 23 home runs and 60 RBIs while batting 
.318 in 90 games. On the date of his injury, the Red Sox were 46-44. However, 
without Ortiz, the Red Sox cratered, going 23-49 over the last two and 
a half months of the season to finish last in the AL East. With free agency 
again looming, Ortiz and the Red Sox agreed to terms on a two year contract 
with $26 million, with incentives that could push the total value of the 
deal to $30 million.[20] The deal was made official on November 5. Ortiz 
rebounded from his injury to post a strong 2013 campaign as he once again 
guided the Red Sox to a first place finish in the AL East. During the regular 
season, he hit 30 home runs, had 103 RBIs and batted .309. He finished 
in the top 10 in all 3 categories in the American League. On April 20, 
before the first game played at Fenway Park since the Boston Marathon bombings 
and his first since August 2012 after an Achilles tendon injury, Ortiz 
spoke emotionally to the crowd and stated, "This is our fucking city, and 
no one is going to dictate our freedom. Stay strong."[21] Ortiz reached 
several career milestones in 2013, including his 500th career double on 
July 2[22] and his 2,000th career hit on September 4. On July 10, Ortiz 
passed Harold Baines to become the all-time leader for hits by a DH with 
1689.[23] On July 27, Ortiz was ejected by home-plate umpire Tim Timmons 
for arguing balls and strikes in a game against the Baltimore Orioles. 
After his ejection, Ortiz used his bat to smash a pressbox phone in the 
dugout.[24] Major League Baseball decided not to suspend Ortiz for the 
incident. In the postseason, Ortiz had 5 home runs and 13 RBIs while batting 
.353 to lead the Red Sox to a World Series championship, the franchise's 
eighth. In Game 2 of the American League Division Series against the Tampa 
Bay Rays, he hit 2 home runs off of Rays' ace pitcher David Price. In Game 
2 of the American League Championship Series vs the Detroit Tigers, Ortiz 
hit a dramatic, game-tying grand slam off reliever Joaquín Benoit in the 
bottom of the 8th inning, helping propel the Red Sox to victory. In the 
World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, Ortiz hit home runs in both 
games 1 and 2, had 6 RBIs and batted .688 as the Red Sox won the series 
4–2. As a result of his performance, Ortiz was awarded the World Series 
Most Valuable Player award.[25] Ortiz gained several new nicknames from 
the media and his teammates as a result of his great postseason play such 
as "Señor Octubre"[26] and "Cooperstown".[27] He finished third in Boston's 
mayoral race that year with 560 write-in votes.[28] He also finished 10th 
in AL MVP voting, the first season he garnered votes since 2007. On March 
23, 2014, Ortiz signed a one-year, $16 million contract extension for the 
2015 season.[29] The extension also included two team option years to potentially 
keep him under contract with the Red Sox through the 2017 season. Once 
the season started, Ortiz continued to hit well, homering 35 times to go 
along with 104 RBI and a .263 average. He again placed in the top 10 in 
the American League in both home runs and RBIs. During a game against the 
Tampa Bay Rays on May 31, Ortiz was hit by a pitch from future Red Sox 
pitcher David Price, leading to both benches being warned. Price later 
hit Mike Carp which led to both benches clearing and an enraged Ortiz shouting 
at Price.[30] On June 29 at Yankee Stadium, Ortiz homered off New York 
Yankees pitcher Chase Whitley for his 450th career home run. In a Boston 
Globe article, Red Sox great Carl Yastrzemski called David Ortiz the second 
greatest hitter in club history, stating "I would say as a hitter, I would 
say he's next to Ted [Williams].[31][32] In 2015, Ortiz hit 37 home runs 
and had 108 RBIs while batting .273. He finished in the top 10 in the American 
League in both home runs and RBIs for the eighth time in his career. On 
April 19, in a game at Fenway Park vs. the Baltimore Orioles, Ortiz was 
ejected for arguing a check swing call. While arguing, Ortiz slightly bumped 
into umpire John Tumpane.[33] Two days later, MLB suspended Ortiz one game 
and fined him an undisclosed amount.[34] On July 14, in an announcement 
prior to the MLB All Star Game at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, 
Ortiz was selected as one of the "Franchise Four" of the Boston Red Sox. 
The selection of the "Franchise Four" (the greatest four players of all 
time for every MLB team) was determined by online voting by fans on the 
MLB.com website. Along with Ortiz, Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski and Ortiz's 
friend Pedro Martínez were selected as the four greatest players in Boston 
Red Sox history. On September 5 at Fenway Park, Ortiz hit his 30th home 
run of the season off of Jerome Williams of the Philadelphia Phillies. 
This marked the ninth time that Ortiz hit 30 or more home runs in a season, 
the most in Red Sox history. On September 12, in a game against the Tampa 
Bay Rays at Tropicana Field, Ortiz hit his 500th career home run off of 
Rays pitcher Matt Moore. He became only the 27th player in MLB history 
to reach that milestone. On November 18, 2015, his 40th birthday, Ortiz 
announced on the website The Players' Tribune that he would retire following 
the 2016 season.[35] In the final season of his career, Ortiz hit 38 home 
runs and had 127 RBIs while batting .315. He finished in the top 10 in 
the American League in home runs and RBIs for the ninth time in his career. 
He finished tied for first in the American League in RBIs with Edwin Encarnacion. 
Ortiz led the American League and Major League baseball with a 1.021 OPS 
and 48 doubles. Throughout the season, opposing teams honored Ortiz by 
presenting him with gifts, some humorous, when the Red Sox visited, similar 
to how teams had done when other stars like Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera 
were in their final season. For example, the New York Yankees presented 
Ortiz with a painting of him at home plate in Yankee Stadium, as well as 
a book of notes to Ortiz written by several former and current Yankees.[36] 
When it was their turn, the Baltimore Orioles presented Ortiz with the 
mangled dugout phone he had destroyed with a bat from his 2013 outburst.[37] 
On May 14, at Fenway Park, Ortiz hit a walk off double to lead the Red 
Sox to a 6-5 victory over the Houston Astros,[38] It was his 20th career 
walk off hit.[39] The double was the 600th of Ortiz' career, making him 
the 15th player all time to reach the milestone. He also joined Hank Aaron 
and Barry Bonds as only the third player in MLB history with at least 500 
career home runs and 600 career doubles.[40] On August 24, in a game against 
the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field, Ortiz hit his 30th home run of the 
season. He became the oldest MLB player to ever do so. In the same game 
he also reached 100 RBI for the season. It was the tenth time in his career 
he reached both milestones, a Red Sox record.[41] He hit his 625th career 
double two days later against the Royals, passing Hank Aaron for tenth 
place all-time.[42] On October 2, during a pregame ceremony at Fenway Park 
for Ortiz prior to the final game of the season, the Red Sox announced 
that his uniform number 34 would be retired during the 2017 season.[43] 
Additionally, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker was on hand to announce 
the bridge that carries Brookline Avenue over the Massachusetts Turnpike 
would be dedicated in honor of Ortiz.[44] Ortiz's strong play in his final 
season was enough to get the Red Sox into the postseason, but a first round 
sweep at the hands of the Cleveland Indians in the 2016 American League 
Division Series ended the Red Sox season on October 10. Following the loss 
at Fenway Park, Ortiz came out and saluted the Boston fans in a tearful 
goodbye before leaving the field. On October 26, Major League Baseball 
announced that Ortiz had won his second Hank Aaron Award as the outstanding 
offensive player in the American League. Each time Ortiz crosses the plate 
after hitting a home run, he looks up and points both index fingers to 
the sky in tribute to his mother, Angela Rosa Arias, who died in a car 
crash in January 2002 at the age of 46.[45] Ortiz also has a tattoo of 
his mother on his biceps. Ortiz's nickname "Big Papi" originates from his 
habit of calling people whose names he can't remember "Papi". The nickname 
was given to him by Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy.[46] Ortiz and his wife, 
Tiffany, have three children. Since marrying Tiffany, he has become a fan 
of the Green Bay Packers. (His wife hails from Kaukauna, Wisconsin, a town 
in between the cities of Green Bay and Appleton).[47] In April 2013, Ortiz 
announced that he and his wife were separating,[48] but they later reconciled.[49] 
On June 11, 2008, Ortiz became a United States citizen at John F. Kennedy 
Library in Boston.[50][51] Ortiz has received about $4.5 million in endorsements 
over the years. In April 2007, sporting-goods company Reebok debuted the 
Big Papi 10M Mid Baseball cleat, which Ortiz first used during the 2007 
MLB All Star Game in San Francisco, California.[52] In October 2009, Ortiz 
opened a night club called "Forty-Forty" in his native Dominican Republic. 
In April 2010, rapper and producer Jay-Z and his business partner Juan 
Perez sued Ortiz for trademark infringement, alleging that the name of 
Ortiz's night club was stolen from Jay-Z's chain of sports clubs in New 
York.[53] In March 2011, Ortiz reached a settlement deal with Jay-Z and 
Perez.[54] Ortiz's daughter, Alex Ortiz, sang the national anthem before 
the 2016 Boston Red Sox home opener on April 11, 2016.[55] In 2007, Ortiz 
founded the David Ortiz Children's Fund to support a range of his favorite 
causes and help children, from Boston to the Dominican Republic and beyond.[citation 
needed] In 2008, Ortiz released his own Charity Wine label, called Vintage 
Papi, which raised $150,000 for the David Ortiz Children's Fund.[56] On 
July 30, 2009, The New York Times, citing anonymous sources, reported that 
Ortiz was among a group of over 100 major league players on a list compiled 
by federal investigators, that allegedly tested positive for performance-enhancing 
drugs during Major League Baseball survey testing conducted in spring training 
of 2003.[57] The survey testing was agreed to by Major League Baseball 
and the Major League Baseball Players Association to determine the extent 
of performance-enhancing drug use among players before permanent testing 
was officially implemented starting in 2004. As part of the agreement, 
the results of the survey testing were supposed to remain confidential 
and no suspensions or penalties would be issued to any player testing positive. 
On August 8, 2009, Ortiz held a press conference before a game at Yankee 
Stadium and denied ever buying or using steroids and suggested the positive 
test might have been due to his use of supplements and vitamins at the 
time.[58] When asked which supplements he had been taking, Ortiz said he 
did not know.[59] Ortiz was accompanied at the press conference by Michael 
Weiner, the general counsel of the Major League Baseball Players Association. 
Because the list of players was seized as part of a government investigation 
and is currently under court-ordered seal pending the outcome of litigation, 
Weiner said the players union was unable to provide Ortiz with any details 
about his test result, including what substance he tested positive for. 
On the same day, both Major League Baseball[60] and the Major League Baseball 
Players Association issued statements[61] pointing out that because of 
several factors, any player appearing on the list compiled by federal investigators 
in 2003 did not necessarily test positive for performance-enhancing drugs. 
Among those factors were that the total number of players said to be on 
the list far exceeded the number of collected specimens that tested positive. 
In addition, there were questions raised regarding the lab that performed 
the testing and their interpretation of the positive tests. Also, the statement 
pointed out that certain legal supplements that were available over the 
counter at the time could cause a positive test result. On October 2, 2016 
at a press conference at Fenway Park, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said 
it was "entirely possible" Ortiz did not test positive during the MLB survey 
drug testing in 2003. The commissioner stated that the alleged failed test 
should not harm Ortiz' legacy, and that there were "legitimate scientific 
questions about whether or not those were truly positives." He also said 
that it is unfair for Hall of Fame voters to consider "leaks, rumors, innuendo, 
not confirmed positive test results," when assessing a player.[62] Notes:
