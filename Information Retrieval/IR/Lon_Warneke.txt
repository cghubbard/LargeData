Lonnie (Lon) Warneke (March 28, 1909 – June 23, 1976) (pronounced WARN-a-key), 
nicknamed "The Arkansas Hummingbird", was a Major League Baseball player, 
Major League umpire, county judge, U.S. military serviceman, and businessman 
from Montgomery County, Arkansas, whose career won-loss record as a pitcher 
for the Chicago Cubs (1930–36, 1942–43, 1945) and St. Louis Cardinals (1937–42) 
was 192–121. Warneke pitched for the National League in the first Major 
League Baseball All-Star Game in 1933, hitting the first triple and scoring 
the first National League run in All-Star game history. He pitched in two 
other All-Star Games (1934, 1936) and was also selected in 1939 and 1941. 
Warneke pitched in two World Series for the Cubs (1932, 1935), compiling 
a record of 2–1, 2.63. He pitched a no-hitter for the Cardinals on August 
30, 1941; opened the 1934 season with back to back one-hitters (April 17 
and 22); and set a Major League Baseball fielding record for pitchers (since 
eclipsed) of 227 consecutive chances without an error, covering 163 games. 
After retiring as a player in 1945, Warneke was an umpire in the Pacific 
Coast League for three years and then in the National League from 1949 
to 1955. Warneke is the only major leaguer who has both played and umpired 
in an All-Star Game (umpired in 1952) and a World Series (umpired in 1954).[1]:23 
Lonnie Warneke, which was his baptismal name, was born March 28, 1909, 
the fourth of five children to Louis W. ("Luke") Warneke and Martha Belle 
Scott Warneke in Owley, Arkansas, six miles south of Mount Ida, the county 
seat of Montgomery County. Mount Ida had a population of 298 in 1920 and 
512 in 1930.[2] Luke Warneke (who stood 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m)) had homesteaded 
160 acres[3] and was a successful farmer in the farming community of Owley, 
which consisted of fifteen families.[4] Montgomery County was one of the 
most rural and sparsely populated counties of Arkansas; by 1910 its population 
had peaked at 12,455.[2] At the time of Lon Warneke's birth the county 
had no paved roads, no electricity, and no running water.[4] Luke Warneke, 
from 1907 to 1913, was in charge of improving the county roads and, using 
the newly acquired road graders drawn by eight mules, he made major improvements 
to the roads throughout the county, transforming them from dirt trails 
often overgrown by brush, pocketed by mud holes, and punctured by tree 
stumps, to passable, graded two-lane (wagon) roads—although still unpaved.[4]:313 
Electricity and running water would not come to most of the county until 
the 1930s. Young Lonnie Warneke attended grade school in the one-room schoolhouse 
in Owley. He soon grew to be among the tallest students in the tiny school. 
He helped his father on the farm and did chores for his mother. In his 
free time, he enjoyed the outdoors, hunted and fished; he also played the 
guitar and fiddle—pursuits that would occupy him his entire life. "Lonnie 
Warneke is a country boy. He loves hunting dogs and good guns, the trails 
and loneliness of the wilderness in the rugged mountains surrounding his 
old home."[1]:12 Even after he became a professional ballplayer, he would 
return to the country and enjoy the outdoors—as well as play in ballgames 
with the locals. Because the school in Owley went only through "middle 
school" years, Warneke attended the nearest high school, that in Mount 
Ida. Because of his 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) stature, Warneke played first base 
for the high school team.[5] In his final year he was pressed into service 
as a relief pitcher: Warneke faced a semi-professional team and struck 
out five of six batters he faced.[1]:13 Warneke also played for the Mount 
Ida Athletics, a squad that played Montgomery County area teams. After 
high school Warneke moved to Houston, Texas, where his older sister, Kate, 
and her husband lived. Warneke got a job delivering telegrams by bicycle 
for Western Union. In Spring 1928, Warneke approached the president of 
the Houston Buffaloes, a Texas League baseball team in the St. Louis Cardinals 
organization, and asked for a tryout as a first baseman. Rebuffed at first, 
Warneke offered to pay his own way to training camp.[5] At camp, Buffaloes 
manager Frank "Pancho" Snyder (former catcher for the Cardinals and New 
York Giants) took a look at Warneke and told the nineteen-year-old that 
he had the arm of a pitcher.[5] After Snyder's evaluation, Warneke was 
sent off to pitch for the Laurel Cardinals of the Cotton States League. 
Warneke impressed no one at Laurel and the Cardinals released him. Due 
to Warneke's ensuing major league success, the St. Louis Cardinals later 
instituted a policy such that "any decision to release a player who possesse[s] 
even one major-league skill (speed, arm, defense, hitting, power) must 
be made by more than one person" of their organization.[6] Warneke completed 
the year with another team in the Cotton States League, the Alexandria 
Reds, a team affiliated with Shreveport of the Texas League. One of Warneke's 
teammates on Alexandria was Ray Prim, with whom he would pitch for the 
Cubs in 1943 and 1945. As a converted pitcher in his first professional 
season, Warneke posted a 1928 combined record for Laurel and Alexandria 
of 6 wins, 14 losses, with a 5.32 ERA in 176 innings pitched. Warneke returned 
to Alexandria for the 1929 season and posted a 16–10 record, with a 3.09 
ERA in 245 innings pitched. Alexandria finished first under manager Pete 
Kilduff. Warneke's success attracted the Chicago Cubs, that year's National 
League pennant winner. On August 23, just before the Cotton States season 
closed, the Associated Press carried a story announcing that Warneke had 
been sold to the Cubs "for $10,000 or more", the highest price ever paid 
for a Cotton States League player.[1]:13 The sale was initially denied 
by the Shreveport organization but then confirmed by telegraph to the Alexandria 
Daily Town Talk a few days later by Kilduff, although he stated the sales 
price of Warneke was $7,500.[1]:14 Whatever the figure, Lonnie "Country" 
Warneke reported to the Chicago Cubs spring training facilities on Santa 
Catalina Island, California in late-February 1930, a month before his twenty-first 
birthday. Warneke was at once involved in an on-field accident that sent 
him to the hospital. On February 24, while pitchers were taking batting 
practice, fellow rookie Bill McAfee, fresh out of the University of Michigan, 
was taking swings and lost his grip on his bat, sending it hurtling against 
the forehead of Warneke, who was standing near the batting cage. Warneke 
slumped to the ground but suffered no serious damage, although he did have 
to report to the hospital and receive a couple stitches.[7] Warneke made 
the regular season roster for the Cubs, although he appeared in only one 
game before being assigned to the Cubs Class-AA affiliate Reading Keystones 
on May 23. A week later Warneke pitched a complete game 6–2 victory over 
Newark, allowing eight hits and striking out five.[1]:14 Yet success largely 
escaped Warneke that year, as he compiled a 9–12 win-loss record with a 
6.03 ERA. He allowed 236 hits in 185 innings for Reading, which finished 
under .500. Despite such numbers, Warneke would never appear in another 
minor league game; instead he played at the major league level for the 
next fourteen years. Among his teammates on Reading was infielder Billy 
Jurges, who would play in the major leagues for seventeen years, including 
six seasons (1931–36) with Warneke as a Cub. Lon Warneke appeared in one 
major league game for the Cubs in 1930. His major league debut was on the 
fourth day of the season, Friday, April 18, at Sportsman's Park, St. Louis 
versus the Cardinals with 6000 in attendance. The twenty-one-year-old Warneke 
took the mound in the bottom of the sixth in relief of Guy Bush, with the 
Cardinals ahead 5–0. Warneke promptly doubled the Cubs' deficit. He worked 
the sixth inning and gave up one run. In the seventh he recorded one out 
and gave up another four runs before being pulled for fellow rookie Lynn 
Nelson. In all, Warneke faced eleven batters, walked five of them, surrendered 
two hits and allowed five earned runs and a wild pitch in 1 1/3 innings. 
The final score of the game was 11–1; the winning pitcher was Bill ("Wild 
Bill") Hallahan. Warneke would not pitch again in the majors until exactly 
one year later. The defending National League Champion Cubs finished in 
second place, two games behind the Cardinals in 1930. Rogers Hornsby, future 
Hall of Famer, took over managing the Cubs from Joe McCarthy with four 
games left in the 1930 season. Hornsby continued as player-manager for 
the Cubs throughout 1931 and the first ninety-nine games of 1932. Warneke's 
second major league game was a year to the date after his first. It was 
also his first major league loss. This time he took the mound on the fifth 
day of the season, Saturday, April 18, 1931, before 30,000 at Wrigley Field 
in Chicago versus the visiting Cardinals. The Cubs had rallied for two 
runs in the ninth to tie the score 5–5 and, having used eight pitchers 
in the first four games of the season and another two in this game, sent 
Warneke out in the top of the tenth. He again showed signs of wildness, 
walking three of six batters faced, allowing a hit and two earned runs, 
and lasting two thirds of the inning before getting pulled. The Cubs could 
not make up the deficit and lost 7–5, with Bill ("Wild Bill") Hallahan 
once again recording the win—and Warneke the loss. In two games, a year 
apart, Warneke's major league record was 0–1, 2 innings pitched, allowing 
seven earned runs on three hits and eight walks, for an ERA of 31.50 and 
a WHIP of 5.50. Although Warneke was not sent down to the minors, and never 
saw minor league service again in his career, he didn't pitch again for 
the Cubs for two months. On June 18 Warneke pitched a scoreless inning 
of relief in a game at Ebbets Field against the Brooklyn Dodgers. He fanned 
two batters, which strike outs were the first two of 1140 in his career. 
Warneke's performance earned him the first start of his career, three days 
later, on Sunday, June 21 in the series closer against Brooklyn. With 15,000 
in attendance, Warneke pitched seven innings, allowing six earned runs 
on nine hits and five walks, with one hit batsman. He allowed his only 
home run of the season to the Dodgers' cleanup hitter, Del Bissonette, 
and departed the game after seven with the Cubs down 6–3. Chicago rallied 
for three in the top of the ninth, thus removing Warneke as the pitcher 
of record. The Dodgers scored one in the ninth to win the game. Warneke 
lost his next two starts, versus the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Philadelphia 
Phillies, before recording his first major league win. On Wednesday, August 
5, Warneke pitched a complete game victory at Wrigley Field against the 
Cincinnati Reds for the first of 192 career victories and 192 career complete 
games. Warneke faced 37 batters, allowing 2 earned runs on 8 hits (all 
singles) and two walks, while striking out 3, winning 3–2. Warneke doubled 
to drive in the first run of his career. The Chicago Tribune wrote: "Of 
great importance in yesterday's game was Lon Warneke, another of the [player-manager, 
Rogers] Hornsby debutants who may be heard from in the future. The slat-like 
lad threw so skillfully that...the Reds were confined to eight hits."[8] 
Warneke started three more games in 1931, two of them complete games. For 
the year, Warneke finished 2–4 with a 3.22 ERA in twenty games, including 
seven starts. In 64 1/3 innings pitched he allowed 67 hits and 37 walks 
while striking out 27. The Cubs ended the year 84–70 in third place, 17 
games behind the repeat league champion Cardinals. Between 1903 and 1942 
the Cubs and Chicago White Sox would almost annually face off in a post-season 
"City Series" when neither team was playing in the World Series.[9] The 
series was officially sanctioned by Major League Baseball beginning in 
1905. Although official rules and league umpires were used, results and 
statistics, just as those for the World Series, were not added to regular 
season totals. Other such "city series" were played elsewhere, such as 
in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, and Ohio. The 1931 Chicago City Series 
was played on seven consecutive days from Wednesday, September 30 to Tuesday, 
October 6. Warneke played in Game 1 of the 1931 Chicago City Series, in 
which 43-year-old Urban (Red) Faber of the White Sox shut out the Cubs 
9–0 at Wrigley Field before a crowd of 15,000. Warneke came on in the seventh 
inning, faced six batters, allowed one hit and one walk, no runs. After 
the 1931 season, Warneke returned home to the family farm in Owley and 
invested part of his summer pay in 200 feeder cattle at $2.00 a head. Soon 
after fattening his herd, the cattle market bottomed out. Warneke remarked 
that he would "keep 'em as pets."[1]:14[10] In 1932, Cubs manager, Rogers 
Hornsby credited veteran backup catcher Zack Taylor with helping correct 
a flaw in Warneke's pitching delivery.[11] Instead of looking at the plate 
when he threw, he looked down at his feet. Taylor corrected the error and 
Warneke gained more control over his blazing fastball and hard-braking 
curveball.[1]:14 Warneke mused that he would win "about a half dozen games" 
during the regular season.[10] Instead, Warneke led the National League 
in wins (22), earned run average (2.37), shutouts (4), and winning percentage 
(.786), leading the Cubs to the National League Pennant and placing second 
in Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award voting.[12] Warneke rose to the top 
of a pitching staff that included Guy Bush (19-11), Charlie Root (15-10), 
and Pat Malone, another 15-game winner. Offensive stars included Gabby 
Hartnett, Charlie Grimm, Riggs Stephenson, Billy Herman. Warneke opened 
the season with five straight complete game victories,[13] helping the 
Cubs to a 17–6 first-place start to the season.[14] From mid-June to late 
July, Warneke ran off a nine-game winning streak,[13] all complete games, 
in a span of 44 Cubs games in which the rest of the pitching staff went 
14–21.[15] On August 4, The Sporting News reported on its front page: "Warneke...is 
the sensation of the outfit, and there is as yet no indication that he 
is going to slow down."[16] That same day first baseman Charlie Grimm took 
over as the Cubs' manager, replacing player-manager Rogers Hornsby, whose 
record was 53–46; the Cubs were in second place, five games behind the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. On August 11, Warneke started, but did not win, a 3–2 
extra inning victory in which the Cubs leapfrogged over the Pirates into 
first place,[17] where they remained for the last 47 games of the season.[15] 
The Cubs finished 37–18 under Grimm. Warneke went 5–1 with two shut outs 
and four no decisions down the stretch.[13] The Cubs' World Series opponent 
were the New York Yankees, who finished 107–47, outscoring their opponents 
1002-724. Led by sluggers Babe Ruth (.341-41-137), Lou Gehrig (.349-34-151), 
Tony Lazzeri (.300-15-113), Bill Dickey (.310-15-84), and Ben Chapman (.299-10-107), 
the team was never shut out all season. The pitching staff included Lefty 
Gomez (24-7), Red Ruffing (18-7), George Pipgras (16-9), and Johnny Allen 
(17-4). The Cubs' scored 720 runs (fourth in the N.L.) and were shut out 
eight times. Only three Cub's batters drove in more than 65 runs: Stephenson, 
85; Grimm, 80; Kiki Cuyler, 77. Both teams led their leagues in ERA: the 
Yankees, 3.98 and the Cubs, 3.44. The Yankees swept the Cubs in the World 
Series. Warneke started and lost Game 2, 5–2, before 50,000 fans at Yankee 
Stadium in New York.[18] Nevertheless, he was the Cubs' most effective 
starter during the series, throwing Chicago's only complete game, in which 
he scattered ten hits, all singles. Warneke suffered early game jitters, 
walking the first two batters he faced (both scored) before striking out 
Babe Ruth. Warneke allowed two more runs in the third and another in the 
fifth. He retired the side in the sixth, seventh, and eighth innings, facing 
the minimum nine batters. He struck out seven Yankees in the game and eight 
in the Series, the most by any Cubs' starter and twice as many as any other 
Cubs' pitcher.[19] On just two days rest, with the Cubs down three games 
to none, Warneke was called upon to relieve in the first inning of Game 
4; he departed in the fourth inning with the Cubs ahead.[20] Major American 
newspapers of the day called Warneke the outstanding National League pitcher 
of the 1932 season[21] and The Sporting News (which had hailed Warneke 
as "a great pitcher, such as pops up once in a lifetime")[16] named him 
as one of two pitchers to its 1932 All-Star team,[22] honors foreshadowing 
the then non-existent Cy Young Award. In October 1936 the Cubs traded Warneke 
to the St. Louis Cardinals for infielder Ripper Collins and pitcher Roy 
Parmelee. The trade was not popular with many Cub fans[23] and may have 
cost the Cubs the pennant.[24] Cub's Gabby Hartnett, player-manager from 
1938 to 1940, said "That trade hurt us. It probably cost us the pennant 
in '37."[1]:19 Without Warneke the Cubs finished 93–61, in second place, 
three games behind the New York Giants. Meanwhile, Warneke led the Cardinals 
staff with an 18–11 record. Parmelee went 7–8 for the Cubs and was sold 
the following year; Collins lasted two seasons with the Cubs. Warneke won 
83 games for the Cardinals during his five and a half seasons in St. Louis. 
In 1937, Warneke led the Cardinals' staff with an 18–11 record. This was 
the only season in which Warneke and fellow Arkansas phenom pitcher Dizzy 
Dean were on the same team. With the Cardinals, Warneke played guitar and 
banjo and sang as a member of teammate John "Pepper" Martin's "Mississippi 
Mudcats" band.[25] On July 8, 1942, two days after the All-Star Game, the 
Chicago Cubs purchased the contract of Lon Warneke for $7,500.[1]:19[26] 
Warneke was inducted into military service on March 23, 1944, five days 
before he turned 35. He had previously announced that he was ready "to 
toss hand grenades at Hitler and Hirohito."[27] Warneke was put in charge 
of recreation at the Naval Ordnance Plant near Camden, Arkansas, and he 
organized, managed, and pitched in a baseball league[28] comprising teams 
from nearby cities, colleges, and military facilities. He rejoined the 
Cubs in June 1945 but pitched in only nine games in his final season as 
a player. Although the Cubs won the Pennant, Warneke did not appear in 
the World Series. Warneke was a businessman in Hot Springs, Arkansas, before 
serving as County Judge of Garland County, Arkansas, from 1963 to 1972. 
Warneke was elected to the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame on January 19, 
1961 and still leads all Arkansas players in many Major League pitching 
categories including wins, games started, innings pitched, complete games, 
and shutouts.[29] Warneke died on June 23, 1976 at his home in Hot Springs. 
He is buried in Owley Cemetery in Owley (Montgomery County), Arkansas. 
On July 21, 2011 Warneke was posthumously inducted into the Reading Baseball
