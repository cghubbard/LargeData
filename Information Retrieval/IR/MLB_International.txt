MLB International is a division of Major League Baseball primarily responsible 
for international broadcasts of games.[1] Prominently, in partnership with 
DirecTV and MLB Network, it produces and syndicates the All-Star Game, 
NLCS, ALCS, and the World Series to broadcasters in over 200 countries, 
and the American Forces Network for U.S. military troops abroad. From 1996 
until 2003 and again starting in 2010, Gary Thorne[2] served as the play-by-play 
man for the World Series on Armed Forces Radio and MLB International.[3][4] 
Dave O'Brien provided commentary for MLB International's coverage of the 
World Series from 2004 until 2009. O'Brien teamed with his usual ESPN partner 
Rick Sutcliffe on broadcasts of the World Series and the American League 
Championship Series for MLB International. From 1996â€“2002, and since 2010, 
MLB International broadcasts the League Championship Series alternately, 
with the American League Championship Series in even-numbered years and 
the National League Championship Series in odd-numbered years.[5] Since 
2015, Matt Vasgersian has served as the play-by-play commentator; for the 
2016 World Series, he was joined by Buck Martinez (television play-by-play 
of the Toronto Blue Jays, and former color commentator for TBS) on color.[6]
