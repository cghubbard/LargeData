Lincoln (pronounced /ˈlɪŋkən/) is the capital of the U.S. state of Nebraska 
and the county seat of Lancaster County. The city covers 92.81 square miles 
(240.38 km2) with a population of 277,348 in 2015. It is the second-most 
populous city in Nebraska and the 72nd-largest in the United States. The 
city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan 
area in the southeastern part of the state called the Lincoln-Beatrice 
Metropolitan Area. The metropolitan area is home to 345,478 people, making 
it the 105th-largest combined statistical area in the United States. The 
city was founded in 1856 as the village of Lancaster on the wild salt marshes 
of what was to become Lancaster County. In 1867, the village of Lancaster 
became Nebraska's state capital and was renamed Lincoln. Bertram G. Goodhue 
designed state capitol building was completed in 1932 and is the second 
tallest capitol in the United States. As the city is the seat of government 
for the state of Nebraska, the state and the United States government are 
major employers. The University of Nebraska was founded in Lincoln in 1867. 
The university is the largest in Nebraska with 25,006 students enrolled 
and is the city's third-largest employer. Other primary employers fall 
within the service and manufacturing industries, including a growing high-tech 
sector. The region makes up a part of what is known as the greater Midwest 
Silicon Prairie. Designated as a "refugee-friendly" city by the U.S. Department 
of State in the 1970s, the city was the twelfth-largest resettlement site 
per capita in the United States by 2000. Refugee Vietnamese, Karen (Burmese 
ethnic minority), Sudanese, and Yazidi (Iraqi ethnic minority) people have 
been resettled in the city. Lincoln Public Schools during the school year 
of 2015–16 provided support for approximately 2,600 students from 118 countries, 
who spoke 96 different languages. Prior to the expansion westward of settlers, 
the prairie was covered with buffalo grass. Plains Indians, descendants 
of indigenous peoples who occupied the area for thousands of years, lived 
in and hunted along Salt Creek. The Pawnee, which included four tribes, 
lived in villages along the Platte River. The Great Sioux Nation, including 
the Ihanktowan-Ihanktowana and the Lakota located to the north and west, 
used Nebraska as a hunting and skirmish ground, although they did not have 
any long-term settlements in the state. An occasional buffalo could still 
be seen in the plat of Lincoln in the 1860s.[9] Lincoln was founded in 
1856 as the village of Lancaster and became the county seat of the newly 
created Lancaster County in 1859.[10] The village was sited on the east 
bank of Salt Creek.[11] The first settlers were attracted to the area due 
to the abundance of salt. Once J. Sterling Morton developed his salt mines 
in Kansas, salt in the village was no longer a viable commodity.[12] Captain 
W. T. Donovan, a former steamer captain, and his family settled on Salt 
Creek in 1856. In the fall of 1859, the village settlers met to form a 
county. A caucus was formed and the committee, which included Captain Donovan, 
selected the village of Lancaster to be the county seat. The county was 
named Lancaster. After the passage of the 1862 Homestead Act, homesteaders 
began to inhabit the area. The first plat was dated August 6, 1864.[9] 
By the close of 1868, Lancaster had a population of approximately 500 people.[13] 
The township of Lancaster was renamed Lincoln with the incorporation of 
the city of Lincoln on April 1, 1869. In 1869, the University of Nebraska 
was established in Lincoln by the state with a land grant of about 130,000 
acres. Construction of University Hall, the first building, began the same 
year.[14] Nebraska was granted statehood on March 1, 1867. The capital 
of the Nebraska Territory had been Omaha since the creation of the territory 
in 1854; however, most of the territory's population lived south of the 
Platte River. After much of the territory south of the Platte River considered 
annexation to Kansas, the territorial legislature voted to locate the capital 
city south of the river and as far west as possible.[15] Prior to the vote 
to remove the capital city from Omaha, a last ditch effort by Omaha Senator 
J. N. H. Patrick attempted to derail the move by having the future capital 
city named after recently assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. Many 
of the people south of the Platte River had been sympathetic to the Confederate 
cause in the recently concluded Civil War. It was assumed that senators 
south of the river would not vote to pass the measure if the future capital 
was named after the former president. In the end, the motion to name the 
future capital city Lincoln was ineffective and the vote to change the 
capital's location south of the Platte River was successful with the passage 
of the Removal Act in 1867.[16][17] The Removal Act called for the formation 
of a Capital Commission to locate a site for the capital on state owned 
land. The Commission, composed of Governor David Butler, Secretary of State 
Thomas Kennard and Auditor John Gillespie, began to tour sites on July 
18, 1867 for the new capital city. The village of Lancaster was chosen, 
in part due to the salt flats and marshes.[18][19] Lancaster had approximately 
30 residents. Disregarding the original plat of the village of Lancaster, 
Thomas Kennard platted Lincoln on a broader scale. The plat of the village 
of Lancaster was not dissolved nor abandoned; Lancaster became Lincoln 
when the Lincoln plat files were finished September 6, 1867.[20] To raise 
money for the construction of a capital city, a successful auction of lots 
was held.[21] Newcomers began to arrive and Lincoln's population grew. 
The Nebraska State Capitol was completed on December 1, 1868; a two-story 
building constructed with native limestone with a central cupola. The Kennard 
house, built in 1869, is the oldest remaining building in the original 
plat of Lincoln.[22] In 1888 a new capitol building was constructed on 
the site of the first capitol. The new building replaced the former structurally 
unsound capitol. The second capitol building was a classical design, designed 
by architect William H. Willcox.[23] Construction began on a third capitol 
building in 1922. Bertram G. Goodhue was selected in a national competition 
as its architect. By 1924, the first phase of construction was completed 
and state offices moved into the new building. In 1925, the Willcox designed 
capitol building was razed. The Goodhue designed capitol was constructed 
in four phases, with the completion of the fourth phase in 1932.[24] The 
capitol is the second tallest capitol building in the United States.[25] 
The completion of the original Goodhue design will be finally realized 
with the completion of the capitol fountains within the four interior courtyards 
of the capitol building in 2017.[24] The worldwide economic depression 
of 1890 saw the reduction of Lincoln's population from 55,000 to 37,000 
by 1900. Volga-German immigrants from Russia settled in the North Bottoms 
neighborhood and as Lincoln expanded with the growth in population, the 
city began to annex towns nearby. Bethany Heights, incorporated in 1890, 
was the first town annexed in 1922.[12] In 1926, the town of University 
Place was annexed.[26] College View, incorporated in 1892, was annexed 
in 1929. Union College, a Seventh Day Adventist institution, was founded 
in College View in 1891. In 1930, annexed the town of Havelock. Havelock 
actively opposed annexation to Lincoln and only relented due to a strike 
by the Burlington railroad shop workers which halted progress and growth 
for the city.[12] The Burlington and Missouri River Railroad's first train 
arrived in Lincoln on June 26, 1870, soon to be followed by the Midland 
Pacific in 1871 and the Atchison and Nebraska in 1872. The Union Pacific 
began service in 1877. The Chicago and North Western and Missouri Pacific 
began service in 1886. The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific extended service 
to Lincoln in 1892. Lincoln became a rail center hub.[12] As automobile 
travel became more common in the U.S., the need for better roads in Nebraska 
and throughout the U.S. grew. The Omaha-Denver Trans-Continental Route 
Association in 1911, with support from the Good Roads Movement, established 
the Omaha-Lincoln-Denver Highway (O-L-D) through Lincoln. The goal was 
having the most efficient highway to travel on throughout Nebraska, from 
Omaha to Denver.[27] In 1920, the Omaha-Denver Association merged with 
the Detroit-Lincoln-Denver Highway Association. As a result, the O-L-D 
was renamed the Detroit-Lincoln-Denver Highway (D-L-D) with the goal of 
having a continuous highway from Detroit to Denver. The goal was eventually 
realized by the mid 1920s; 1,700 mi (2,700 km) of constantly improved highway 
through six states.[28] The auto route was a tourist magnet and traffic 
was heavy. Businesses were built and facilities were established in towns 
along the route in order to keep up with traveler demand. In 1924, the 
D-L-D was officially designated as Nebraska State Highway 6. In 1926, the 
highway became part of the Federal Highway System and was renumbered U.S. 
Route 38. In 1931, U.S. 38 was renumbered as a U.S. 6/U.S. 38 overlap and 
in 1933, the U.S. 38 route designation was dropped.[29][30] In the early 
years of air travel, Lincoln had three airports and one airfield.[31] Union 
Airport, was established northeast of Lincoln in 1920. The Lincoln Flying 
School was founded by E.J. Sias in a building he built at 2145 O Street.[32] 
Charles Lindbergh was a student at the flying school in 1922. The flying 
school closed in 1947.[32] Some remnants of the Union Airport can still 
be seen in-between N. 56th and N. 70th Streets, north of Fletcher Avenue; 
mangled within a slowly developing industrial zone.[33] Arrow Airport was 
established around 1925 as a manufacturing and test facility for Arrow 
Aircraft and Motors Corporation, primarily the Arrow Sport. The airfield 
was located near Havelock; or to the west of where the North 48th Street 
Small Vehicle Transfer Station is located today. Arrow Aircraft and Motors 
declared bankruptcy in 1939 and Arrow Airport closed roughly several decades 
later.[34] An existing Arrow Sport can be seen on permanent display, hanging 
in the Lincoln Airport's main passenger terminal.[31][35] The city's small 
municipal airfield in 1930 was dedicated to Charles Lindbergh and named 
Lindbergh Field for a short period of time as another airfield was named 
Lindbergh in California. The airfield was north of Salt Lake, in an area 
known variously over the years as Huskerville, Arnold Heights and Air Park; 
and was located approximately within the western half of the West Lincoln 
Township.[36][37][38] The air field was a stop for United Airlines in 1927 
and a mail stop in 1928.[39] As train, automobile, and air travel increased, 
business flourished, and the city prospered. The population of Lincoln 
increased 38.2% from 1920 to a population of 75,933 in 1930.[40] In 1942 
the Lincoln Army Airfield was established at the site. During World War 
II, over 25,000 aviation mechanics were trained with over 40,000 troopers 
being processed for combat. The Army closed the base in 1945. The Air Force 
reactivated the base during the Korean War in 1952. In 1966, the base was 
closed and Lincoln annexed the airfield, including the base's old housing 
units to the west.[36] The base became the Lincoln Municipal Airport under 
ownership of the Lincoln Airport Authority. The airport was later renamed 
the Lincoln Airport. The two main airlines serving the airport were United 
Airlines and Frontier Airlines. The authority shared facilities with the 
Nebraska National Guard, who continued ownership over some portions of 
the old Air Force base.[41] In 1966, Lincoln annexed the township of West 
Lincoln, incorporated in 1887. West Lincoln voters rejected annexation 
by Lincoln until the state legislature passed a bill in 1965 allowing cities 
to annex surrounding areas without a vote.[42] The downtown core retail 
district from 1959 to 1984 saw profound changes as retail shopping moved 
from downtown to the suburban Gateway Shopping Mall. In 1956, Bankers Life 
Insurance Company of Nebraska announced plans to build a $6 million shopping 
center next to their new campus on the east-side outskirts of Lincoln. 
Gateway Mall was completed and open for business at 60th and O streets 
in 1960.[43][44] By 1984, 75% of Lincoln's revenue from retail sales tax 
came from within a one-mile radius of the Mall. With the exodus of retail 
and service businesses, the downtown core began to decline and deteriorate.[45] 
The Nebraska legislature in 1969 legislated laws for urban renewal and 
shortly thereafter Lincoln began a program of revitalization and beautification 
of the city. Most of the urban renewal projects focused on downtown and 
the near South areas. Many ideas were considered and not implemented. Successes 
included Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery, designed by Philip Johnson; new 
branch libraries, new street lighting, the First National Bank Building 
and the National Bank of Commerce Building designed by I.M. Pei.[46] In 
1971, an expansion of Gateway Mall was completed. Lincoln's first woman 
mayor, Helen Boosalis, was elected in 1975. Mayor Boosalis was a strong 
supporter of the revitalization of Lincoln with the downtown beautification 
project being completed in 1978. In 1979, the square-block downtown Centrum 
was opened and connected to buildings with a skywalk. The Centrum was a 
two-level shopping mall with a garage for 1,038 cars. With the beautification 
and urban renewal projects, many historic buildings were razed in the city.[46] 
In 2007 and 2009, the city of Lincoln received beautification grants for 
improvements on O and West O Streets, west of the Harris Overpass, commemorating 
the history of the D-L-D.[28][47] Vietnamese refugees, from the fall of 
Saigon in 1975, established a significant ethnic community with businesses 
along the 27th Street corridor alongside Mexican eateries and African markets.[48] 
Lincoln was designated as a "Refugee Friendly" city by the U.S. Department 
of State in the 1970s. In 2000, Lincoln was the twelfth-largest resettlement 
site per capita in the country.[49] As of 2011, Lincoln had the largest 
Karen (Burmese ethnic minority) population in the United States, behind 
Omaha.[50][51] As of the same year, Nebraska was one of the largest resettlement 
sites for the people of Sudan, mostly in Lincoln and Omaha.[52] In recent 
years, Lincoln had the largest Yazidi (Iraqi ethnic minority) population 
in the U.S.[53][54][55] The decade from 1990 to 2000 saw a significant 
rise in population from 191,972 to 225,581. North 27th Street and Cornhusker 
Highway were redeveloped with new housing and businesses built. The boom 
housing market in south Lincoln created new housing developments including 
high end housing in areas like Cripple Creek, Willamsburg and The Ridge. 
The shopping center Southpointe Pavilions was completed in competition 
of Gateway Mall.[56] In 2001, Gateway Mall was purchased by Westfield America 
Trust.[57] Westfield renamed the mall Westfield Shoppingtown Gateway; then 
in 2005, Westfield Gateway.[58] Westfield made a $45 million makeover of 
the mall in 2005 including an expanded food court, a new west-side entrance 
and installation of an Italian carousel.[59] In 2012, Westfield America 
Trust sold Westfield Gateway to Starwood Capital Group. Starwood reverted 
the mall's name from Westfield Gateway to Gateway Mall and has made incremental 
expansions and renovations.[57][60] In 2015, ALLO Communications announced 
that it would bring ultra-high speed fiber internet to the city. Speeds 
up to 1 Gigabit per second were planned for both business and household 
use by using the city's existing fiber network. Construction on the citywide 
network was to begin in March 2016 and was estimated to be complete by 
2019.[61] Telephone and cable TV service would also be included,[62] making 
it the third company to compete for such services within Lincoln. In April 
2016, Windstream Communications announced that 2,300 customers in Lincoln 
had 1 Gigabit per second internet with an expected expansion of services 
to 25,000 customers by 2017, making it the first company to have ultra-fast 
internet available within the city.[63][64] Lincoln has a total area of 
92.81 square miles (240.38 km2), of which 91.45 square miles (236.85 km2) 
of it is land and 1.35 square miles (3.50 km2) is water, according to the 
United States Census Bureau in 2015.[3] Lincoln is one of the few large 
cities of Nebraska not located along either the Platte River or the Missouri 
River. The city was originally laid out near Salt Creek and among the nearly 
flat saline wetlands of northern Lancaster County.[65] The city's growth 
over the years has led to development of the surrounding land, much of 
which is composed of gently rolling hills. In recent years, Lincoln's northward 
growth has encroached on the habitat of the endangered Salt Creek tiger 
beetle.[66] Lincoln is in two metropolitan statistical areas as defined 
by the United States Census Bureau. The Lincoln Metropolitan Statistical 
Area consists of Lancaster County and Seward County.[67] Seward county 
was added to the metropolitan area in 2003. Lincoln is also in the Lincoln-Beatrice 
Combined Statistical Area which consists of the Lincoln metropolitan area 
and the micropolitan area of Beatrice. The city of Beatrice is the county 
seat of Gage County. The Lincoln-Beatrice metropolitan area is home to 
345,478 people (2015 estimated) making it the one-hundred-fifth-largest 
combined statistical area in the United States.[68] Lincoln's neighborhoods 
include both old and new development. Some neighborhoods in Lincoln were 
formerly small towns that Lincoln later annexed, including University Place 
in 1926, Belmont, Bethany (Bethany Heights) in 1922, College View in 1929, 
Havelock in 1930, and West Lincoln in 1966.[12] A number of Historic Districts 
are located near downtown Lincoln, while newer neighborhoods have appeared 
primarily in the south and east.[69] As of December 2013, Lincoln had 45 
registered neighborhood associations within the city limits.[70] One core 
neighborhood that has seen rapid residential growth in recent years is 
the downtown Lincoln area. In 2010, there were 1,200 downtown Lincoln residents; 
in 2016, there were 3,000 (an increase of 140%).[71] Located on the Great 
Plains far from the moderating influence of mountains or large bodies of 
water, Lincoln possesses a highly variable four-season humid continental 
climate (Köppen Dfa): winters are cold but relatively dry, summers are 
hot and occasionally humid.[72] With little precipitation falling during 
winter, precipitation is concentrated in the warmer months, when thunderstorms 
frequently roll in, often producing tornadoes. Snow averages 25.9 inches 
(66 cm) per season but seasonal accumulation has ranged from 7.2 in (18 cm) 
in 1967–68 to 54.3 in (138 cm) in 1959–60.[73] Snow tends to fall in light 
amounts, though blizzards are possible. There is an average of 39 days 
with a snow depth of 1 in (2.5 cm) or more. The average window for freezing 
temperatures is October 5 thru April 25, allowing a growing season of 162 
days.[73] The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 24.6 °F (−4.1 °C) 
in January to 77.6 °F (25.3 °C) in July. However, the city is subject both 
to episodes of bitter cold in winter and heat waves during summer, with 
11.4 nights of sub-0 °F (−18 °C) lows, 41 days of 90 °F (32 °C)+ highs, 
and 4.6 days of 100 °F (38 °C)+ highs.[73] The city straddles the boundary 
of USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 5b and 6a.[74] Temperature extremes have 
ranged from −33 °F (−36 °C) on January 12, 1974 up to 115 °F (46 °C) on 
July 25, 1936.[73] Readings as high as 105 °F (41 °C) or as low as −20 °F 
(−29 °C) occur somewhat rarely; the last occurrence of each was July 22, 
2012 and February 3, 1996.[73] Based on 30-year averages obtained from 
NOAA's National Climatic Data Center for the months of December, January 
and February, Weather Channel ranked Lincoln the seventh-coldest major 
U.S. city as of 2014[75] In 2014, the Lincoln-Beatrice area was among the 
"Cleanest U.S. Cities for Ozone Air Pollution" in the American Lung Association's 
"State of the Air 2014" report.[76] Lincoln is the second-most-populous 
city in Nebraska.[81] The U.S. Government designated Lincoln in the 1970s 
as a refugee-friendly city due to its stable economy, educational institutions, 
and size. Since then, refugees from Vietnam settled in Lincoln, and further 
waves came from other countries.[82] In 2013, Lincoln was named one of 
the "Top Ten most Welcoming Cities in America" by Welcoming America.[83][84] 
As of the census[6] of 2010, there were 258,379 people, 103,546 households, 
and 60,300 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,899.6 
inhabitants per square mile (1,119.5/km2). There were 110,546 housing units 
at an average density of 1,240.6 per square mile (479.0/km2). The racial 
makeup of the city was 86.0% White, 3.8% African American, 0.8% Native 
American, 3.8% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 2.5% from other races, and 
3.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.3% of 
the population. There were 103,546 households of which 27.7% had children 
under the age of 18 living with them, 44.0% were married couples living 
together, 10.2% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.1% 
had a male householder with no wife present, and 41.8% were non-families. 
31.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.8% had someone 
living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size 
was 2.36 and the average family size was 3.01. The median age in the city 
was 31.8 years. 22.7% of residents were under the age of 18; 15.7% were 
between the ages of 18 and 24; 27.9% were from 25 to 44; 22.9% were from 
45 to 64; and 10.7% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of 
the city was 50.0% male and 50.0% female. Lincoln's economy is fairly typical 
of a mid-sized American city; most economic activity is derived from the 
service and manufacturing industries.[85] Government and the University 
of Nebraska are both large contributors to the local economy. Other prominent 
industries in Lincoln include finance, insurance, publishing, manufacturing, 
pharmaceutical, telecommunications, railroads,[86] high technology,[85] 
information technology, medical, education and truck transport. For June 
2016, the Lincoln Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) preliminary unemployment 
rate was 3.1% (not seasonally adjusted).[87] With a tight labor market, 
Lincoln has seen rapid wage growth. From the summer of 2014 to the summer 
of 2015, the average hourly pay for both public and private employees have 
increased by 11%. From October 2014 to October 2015, wages were also up 
by 8.4%.[88] One of the largest employers is Bryan Health, which consists 
of two major hospitals and several large outpatient facilities located 
across the city. Healthcare and medical jobs account for a substantial 
portion of Lincoln's employment: as of 2009, full-time healthcare employees 
in the city included 9,010 healthcare practitioners in technical occupations, 
4,610 workers in healthcare support positions, 780 licensed and vocational 
nurses, and 150 medical and clinical laboratory technicians.[89] Several 
national business were originally established in Lincoln; these include 
student lender Nelnet, Ameritas, Assurity, Fort Western Stores and HobbyTown 
USA. Several regional restaurant chains began in Lincoln, including Amigos/Kings 
Classic,[90] Runza Restaurants and Valentino's.[91] The Lincoln area makes 
up a part of what is known as the greater Midwest Silicon Prairie.[92] 
In 2013, Lincoln ranked No. 4 on Forbes' list of the Best Places for Business 
and Careers[93] and No. 1 on "NerdWallet"'s Best Cities for Job Seekers 
in 2015.[94] According to the City's 2015 Comprehensive Annual Financial 
Report,[95] the principal employers of the city are: The Nebraska Air and 
Army National Guard's Joint Force Headquarters are located in Lincoln along 
with other major units of the Nebraska National Guard.[96] During the early 
years of the Cold War, the Lincoln Airport was the Lincoln Air Force Base;[97] 
currently, the Nebraska Air National Guard, along with the Nebraska Army 
National Guard, have joint-use facilities with the Lincoln Airport.[98] 
Since the opening of Pinnacle Bank Arena in 2013, Lincoln's emerging music 
scene has grown to the point where it is sometimes referred to as a "Music 
City."[99][100][101] Primary venues for live music include: Pinnacle Bank 
Arena,[102] Bourbon Theatre, Duffy's Tavern, and the Zoo Bar. The Pla-Mor 
Ballroom is a classic Lincoln music and dance scene with its in-house Sandy 
Creek Band. Pinewood Bowl hosts a range of performances - from national 
music performances to local plays during the warm weather months.[103] 
The Lied Center is a venue for national tours of Broadway productions, 
concert music, guest lectures, and regularly features its resident orchestra 
Lincoln's Symphony Orchestra.[104] Lincoln has several performing arts 
venues. Plays are staged by UNL students in the Temple Building;[105] community 
theater productions are held at the Lincoln Community Playhouse,[106] the 
Loft at The Mill, and the Haymarket Theater. For movie viewing, Marcus 
Theatres owns 32 screens at four locations, and the University of Nebraska's 
Mary Riepma Ross Media Arts Center shows independent and foreign films.[107] 
Standalone cinemas in Lincoln include the Joyo Theater and Rococo Theater. 
The Rococo Theater also hosts benefits and other engagements.[108] The 
downtown section of O Street is Lincoln's primary bar and nightclub district.[109] 
Lincoln is the hometown of Zager and Evans, known for their international 
No. 1 hit record, "In the Year 2525" (1969).[110] It is also the home town 
of several notable musical groups, such as Remedy Drive, VOTA, the Bathtub 
Dogs, For Against, Lullaby for the Working Class, Matthew Sweet, Dirtfedd, 
The Show is the Rainbow and Straight. Lincoln is home to Maroon 5 guitarist 
James Valentine. In 2012, the city was listed among the 10 best places 
to retire in the United States by U.S. News & World Report.[111] Annual 
events in Lincoln have come and gone throughout time, such as Band Day 
at the University of Nebraska's Lincoln campus [112] and the Star City 
Holiday Parade.[113] However, some events have never changed while new 
traditions have been created. Current annual cultural events in Lincoln 
include the Lincoln National Guard Marathon and Half-Marathon in May,[114] 
Celebrate Lincoln in early June,[115] the Uncle Sam Jam around July 3,[116] 
and Boo at the Zoo in October.[117] A locally popular event is the Haymarket 
Farmers' Market, running from May to October in the Historic Haymarket,[118] 
one of several farmers markets throughout the city.[119] Tourist attractions 
and activities include the Sunken Gardens,[120] basketball games at Pinnacle 
Bank Arena,[102] the Lincoln Children's Zoo, the dairy store at UNL's East 
Campus,[121] and Mueller Planetarium on the city campus.[122] The Nebraska 
State Capitol,[123] which is also the tallest building in Lincoln,[124] 
offers tours. The Frank H. Woods Telephone Museum[125] exhibits historical 
telephone technology. The Speedway Motors Museum of American Speed preserves, 
interprets and displays physical items significant in racing and automotive 
history.[126] Lincoln is home to the University of Nebraska's football 
team, the Nebraska Cornhuskers. In total, the university fields 22 men's 
and women's teams in 14 NCAA Division I sports.[127] Nebraska football 
began play in 1890.[128] Among the 128 Division I-A teams, Nebraska is 
one of ten football programs to win 800 or more games.[129] Notable coaches

students.[160][159] The continually increasing influx of refugees and immigrants 
to Lincoln over recent years, which has included refugees/immigrants from 
Iraq, Mexico, Burma and refugee camps in Thailand, has caused LPS to hire 
additional ELL teachers at an increasingly rapid pace.[161] Nine colleges
