Clifford Franklin Mapes (March 13, 1922 – December 5, 1996) was a professional 
baseball player. He played five seasons of Major League Baseball as an 
outfielder for the New York Yankees, St. Louis Browns and Detroit Tigers.[1] 
Mapes, who was listed with a height of 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m), and a weight 
of 205 lb (93 kg), was originally signed as an amateur free agent by the 
Cleveland Indians prior to the 1940 season.[1] He never played for the 
Indians, and was later drafted by the New York Yankees in the 1946 Rule 
5 draft. After a season in the minors, Mapes was recalled to the Major 
League level, where he saw limited time as a backup to an outfield that 
contained Joe DiMaggio, Tommy Henrich, and Johnny Lindell.[2] Mapes hit 
.250, with 12 runs batted in, and his first career home run.[1] In his 
second season, Mapes saw regular time as a starter. He hit .247 with seven 
home runs and 38 runs batted in, but also led the team in strikeouts in 
helping the Yankees claim the American League pennant.[3] He was the team's 
starting right fielder against the Brooklyn Dodgers, and he helped the 
team win the 1949 World Series,[4][5][6][7] the team's first World Series 
en route to five consecutive world championships.[8] In 1950, Mapes led 
the team in strikeouts for the second consecutive season.[9] His playing 
time remained the same, but his power numbers improved from a year earlier. 
Mapes hit batted .247 with 12 home runs and 61 runs batted in, but also 
grounded into a team-high 14 double plays.[9] The Yankees finished the 
season with the American League pennant once again, but Mapes saw little 
time in the postseason; Mapes only appeared in one game as the Yankees 
won the 1950 World Series in a four-game sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies.[10] 
As Mapes' numbers started to decrease in 1951, including a batting average 
which fell to .216, the Yankees decided to cut ties with him. He was purchased 
by the St. Louis Browns on July 31, 1951.[1] After a moderate season with 
the Browns, he was traded with Matt Batts, Dick Littlefield, and Ben Taylor 
to the Detroit Tigers for Gene Bearden, Bob Cain, and Dick Kryhoski. In 
1952, for the Tigers, Mapes hit a career-low .197, and was traded back 
to the Browns, with Neil Berry and cash, for Jake Crawford. However, instead 
of choosing to play for the team that had traded him a year earlier, Mapes 
decided to end his professional baseball career. He played his final game 
on September 28, 1952. Mapes wore number 3 for the Yankees until that number 
was retired in honor of Babe Ruth. Mapes then wore number 13 before switching 
to number 7.[11] When Mapes was traded by the Yankees in 1951, Mickey Mantle 
took uniform number 7. Mapes, thus, is mainly remembered as the Yankee 
who wore both Babe Ruth's and Mickey Mantle's numbers.[12] On December
