Michael Lance Lynn (born May 12, 1987) is an American professional baseball 
starting pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
The Cardinals selected him in the first round of the 2008 MLB Draft from 
the University of Mississippi. He made his MLB debut on June 2, 2011, was 
a member of the Cardinals' World Series championship team that year, and 
a National League All-Star in 2012. At Ole Miss, Lynn set the school's 
single-season (146) and career (332) pitching strikeout records. In 2009, 
he was named the Cardinals organizational Pitcher of the Year after playing 
in three levels and totaling a 2.85 earned run average and 124 strikeouts 
in 148 2⁄3 innings pitched. The Cardinals have made the playoffs in each 
of Lynn's major league seasons, and he has participated each time. On May 
27, 2014, Lynn pitched his first career complete game and shutout, earned 
his 500th career strikeout three weeks later, and 50th career win April 
15, 2015. Through 2015, he was the Cardinals' all-time franchise leader 
in career strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (SO/9), with 8.7. After undergoing 
Tommy John surgery, Lynn missed the entire 2016 season. He is currently 
signed through 2017. Lynn was born on May 12, 1987, in Indianapolis, Indiana,[1] 
to Mike and Jenny Lynn. He was part of the Brownsburg Little League (Brownsburg, 
Indiana) that appeared in the 1999 Little League World Series, who won 
the Central Regional Championship in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.[2] He 
attended Brownsburg High School, where he was teammate of fellow future 
major league pitcher Drew Storen, and earned All-State honors in his sophomore 
and junior season.[3] As a junior, Lynn hit .509 (AVG) with 14 home runs 
(HR) and 46 runs batted in (RBI). On the mound, he posted a 1.26 earned 
run average (ERA) and 160 strikeouts (SO) in 100 innings pitched (IP), 
a 10–3 win–loss record (W–L), and three saves. His team went 36-0 his senior 
year as they won the 4A state championship. That year, he hit .400 with 
14 HR; his ERA was 0.71 and record was 16–0.[3] At Brownsburg, Lynn's cumulative 
batting totals included a .473 AVG and 92 RBI. His career pitching totals 
were a 1.10 ERA in 288 IP, 39–4 W–L, seven saves and 455 SO. For the state 
of Indiana, Lynn was the Gatorade Player of the Year in 2005. He was also 
a Louisville Slugger and Electronic Arts All-America selection. When Lynn 
played at the Area Code Games, Nike named him an All-Star, and he was teammates 
with fellow future Ole Miss Rebels baseball signees Evan Button and Scott 
Van Slyke.[3] The Seattle Mariners selected Lynn in the 6th round of the 
June 2005 MLB Draft, but did not sign. He instead chose to attend and play 
at the University of Mississippi. In 2007, he set the Ole Miss single season 
(146) and career (332) strikeout records. He was named All-Southeastern 
Conference second-team pitcher in 2007 and 2008. His overall college record 
was 22–12 W–L with a 3.95 ERA.[4] The St. Louis Cardinals selected Lynn 
in the first round (39th pick) of the June 2008 MLB amateur draft. In 2009, 
Lynn was named the Cardinals' organizational Pitcher of the Year after 
jumping three levels in his first full professional season. His final start 
for the year was for the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds of the Pacific Coast 
League (PCL). His season totals included a 2.85 ERA and 124 SO in 148 2⁄3 
IP. He led all Cardinals minor league pitchers in SO from 2009–10 (141 
in 2010).[4] Spending the entire 2010 season with Memphis, Lynn also led 
all Cardinals minor league pitchers in games started (29), was second with 
164 IP and 13 wins, and ninth with 7.74 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched 
(K/9). In addition, he led the PCL in SO and games started and was second 
in wins in 2010.[4] On September 10, 2010, Lynn broke the Redbirds' single-game 
franchise strikeout record, fanning 16 against the Oklahoma City RedHawks 
in a playoff game. It was also the highest strikeout performance that year 
in all the minor leagues.[5] The club added Lynn to the 40 man roster and 
activated him on June 2, 2011. He made his major league debut that night 
at Busch Stadium against the San Francisco Giants.[6] In 34 1⁄3 IP in the 
regular season with the Cardinals, Lynn notched 40 SO while allowing 25 
H and 11 BB. A pulled flank muscle in August prevented him from appearing 
in a game until a surprise appearance in the postseason.[4] On October 
10, Lynn was awarded the win after throwing exactly one pitch in Game 2 
of the National League Championship Series (NLCS) against the Milwaukee 
Brewers.[7] In the World Series, Lynn gave up back-to-back HR in the top 
of the seventh to Adrián Beltré and Nelson Cruz. However, he won the World 
Series with the Cardinals, making a total of 10 appearances during the 
postseason after appearing in just 18 games during the 2011 regular season. 
After arriving at Cardinals spring training (ST) in February 2012, Lynn 
announced he would begin wearing the number 31. When Chris Carpenter went 
on the disabled list (DL) early in the season, Lynn replaced him in the 
rotation. He started strong, winning his first six games with an ERA of 
.140. One of his best games came on June 13 against the Chicago White Sox. 
He completed 7 1⁄3 innings, struck out a career-high 12 batters, and gave 
up only three hits. That performance lowered his ERA to 2.42. He also became 
the second player that season to win 10 games behind R.A. Dickey.[8] Lynn 
finished his first half with a 3.41 ERA and 11–4 record in 17 starts. Subsequently, 
he was named to his first All-Star Game. However, he scuffled with a 5.23 
ERA in his next eight starts, and was removed from the rotation. Joe Kelly 
replaced him in the rotation. Through his first 25 starts, he was 13–5 
with a 3.93 ERA.[9] His August ERA ballooned to 6.66 and his second-half 
ERA overall was 4.32. Lynn attributed the high weight and poor conditioning 
that to the inconsistency. He finished the regular season with an 18–7 
record and 180 SO, 3.78 ERA in 35 games, 29 starts and 176 IP.[10] His 
9.2 SO/9 placed fourth in franchise history.[11] He placed second in the 
NL in wins, seventh in winning percentage, and fourth in SO/9. Lynn was 
added back to the rotation in the NLDS against the Washington Nationals 
after the team shifted Jaime García to the DL due to a rotator cuff injury. 
He was the Game 5 starter in the NLCS against the San Francisco Giants, 
in which the Cardinals held a 3–1 series lead. However, he gave up four 
runs in 3 2⁄3 IP as the Cardinals eventually lost the series.[10] The right-hander 
made a conscious effort to change his eating and conditioning habits to 
reach 200 IP in 2013. He showed to ST weighing 239 pounds, about 41 pounds 
lighter than his last start in the 2012 NLCS.[10] As a result, his teammates 
needled him with jokes, such as "Where's your other half?" from Adam Wainwright 
and "Who's the new guy?" from two others.[12] He reached his season goal 
of 200 IP, with 201 2⁄3, and was 15–10 with 198 SO and 3.97 ERA. His ERA 
remained steady: 4.00 in the first half, 3.93 in the second of the season. 
He improved his ERA in September to 2.12.[10] His win total was sixth in 
the NL, strikeouts ninth, and 33 starts placed second. On the recommendation 
of the team chef Simon Lusky, Lynn decreased the amount of refined carbohydrates 
and fats in his diet. He showed up to 2014 ST with an even slimmer look.[13] 
In a ST game on March 14, Lynn struck out 10 Atlanta Braves in four innings, 
including the final eight hitters he faced.[14] On April 14, the Cardinals 
stopped the Milwaukee Brewers' nine-game winning streak behind Lynn's seven 
scoreless innings. Lynn, who had entered the game with a 6.55 ERA for the 
season, won his third decision behind 11 SO and just three hits allowed 
as St. Louis prevailed 4–0.[15] Against the Washington Nationals on April 
19, he stroked his first career extra base hit – an RBI double – while 
picking up the decision for the win in a 4–3 victory.[16] On May 27, Lynn 
pitched his first career complete game against the New York Yankees, a 
shutout.[17] Making his 100th career MLB appearance and another start against 
the Nationals on Friday, June 13, Lynn pitched five perfect innings on 
his way to two hits through eight IP in a 1–0 victory over Jordan Zimmermann.[18] 
In a 3–2 loss to the New York Mets five days later, he notched his 500th 
career strikeout, through 503 career IP.[19] Baffling the Colorado Rockies 
on the corners of the strike zone on June 23, Lynn pitched another eight 
shutout innings in an 8–0 victory at Coors Field while allowing just three 
hits.[20] The Cardinals made the playoffs again in 2014, and Lynn started 
one game each in the NLDS against the Dodgers and in the NLCS against the 
Giants. He finished with a 3.08 combined ERA and 11 SO in 11 2⁄3 IP.[21] 
Arbitration-eligible for the first time in his career, Lynn and the Cardinals 
agreed to a three-year, $22 million contract on January 15, 2015. It bought 
out his three remaining years before free agency and included up to an 
additional $1.5 million in performance bonuses. Only Wainwright (53) and 
Clayton Kershaw (51) surpassed his win total (48) in the National League 
over the previous three seasons. In that time, Lynn allowed a 3.48 ERA 
and 1.300 WHIP over 95 starts.[22][23] Making his 99th career start on 
April 15, 2015, Lynn earned his 50th career win in a 4–2 victory over Milwaukee. 
It was his 13th win in the month of April since 2012, the highest total 
in MLB.[24] Through his first 12 starts of the season, he was 4–4 with 
a 3.07 ERA. However, after his June 7 start against the Dodgers, he suffered 
a right forearm strain. The Cardinals placed him on the DL on June 12. 
Lynn returned from the DL on June 24.[25] He returned to action the next 
day against the Miami Marlins, pitching six scoreless innings in a 5–1 
victory.[26] In a 10–5 loss to the Pirates on August 13, 2015, Lynn recorded 
just two outs while allowing seven runs total, three earned, a home run 
and six hits while throwing 41 pitches. It was the shortest outing of his 
career as a starter,[27] and the quickest exit for a Cardinals starter 
since Anthony Reyes on October 1, 2006, by reason other than injury.[28] 
After returning from the DL in June, Lynn started 19 games with an 8–7 
record, 3.00 ERA and completed 102 IP, but made it through seven innings 
just once in his last six starts of the season.[29] He finished the season 
with a 12–11 record and 3.03 ERA in 175 1⁄3 IP. Through that point in his 
major league career, he allowed a .248 batting average against,[30] and 
was the Cardinals all-time franchise leader with 8.7 SO/9 among all players 
with at least 500 IP for the club.[11] On November 10, 2015, the Cardinals 
announced that Lynn would miss the 2016 season after undergoing Tommy John 
surgery (TJS).[31] He began a rehab stint with the Palm Beach Cardinals 
on August 15, 2016, pitching 1 2⁄3 scoreless innings. The typical TJS recovery 
time is 12−15 months.[32] Lynn has four pitches in his arsenal: a four-seam 
fastball that typically travels between 93 miles per hour (150 km/h) (miles 
per hour) and 95 miles per hour (153 km/h), and tops out at 97 miles per 
hour (156 km/h); a two-seam fastball [92 miles per hour (148 km/h)–93]; 
a cut fastball [87 miles per hour (140 km/h)–88 miles per hour (142 km/h)]; 
and a curveball [79 miles per hour (127 km/h)–80 miles per hour (130 km/h)]. 
He uses his cutter mostly against right-handed hitters. Besides his four-seam 
fastball, his curve is his most commonly thrown pitch with two strikes.[33] 
His four-seamer had one of the highest K/9 among fastballs thrown by relief 
pitchers in 2012.[34] In 2012, Lynn finished third in the National League 
in 2012 in K/9, at 9.205. He finished ninth in 2013 with a 8.836 rate.[1] 
His 33 wins between 2012–13 led all NL starting pitchers over that span.[35] 
Lynn stands 6' 5" and weighs 240 lbs. In November 2010, he married Lauren 
(Grill) Lynn, who was a softball player at Ole Miss, they have since divorced. 
[36] On MLB's Now You Know he stated that if he were not a professional 
baseball player he would work for UPS. Throughout his career, Lynn has 
battled weight problems which have affected his conditioning. The better 
shape he has been in, the longer he can go in workouts, and thus, the longer 
he can effectively pitch in single games and throughout the entire season. 
To improve his weight and conditioning, he conferred with fellow Cardinals 
starters Chris Carpenter, Wainwright and Jake Westbrook about their in-season 
and off-season preparations methods in the 2012–13 off-season. He obtained 
team strength and conditioning coach Pete Prinzi's help in formulating 
an offseason training regimen to address his lapses and stimulate weight 
loss. The Cardinals also sent team chef Lusky to spend a week with Lynn 
and his wife Lauren in their home, where he showed them better methods 
to select and prepare healthy food.[12] Lynn also replaced favorites pizza 
and beer with more water and vodka.[10] A change in how he processes adversity 
has also yielded visible results. In 2014, Lynn verbally acknowledged how 
not handling his emotions during difficult innings affected his ability 
to limit damage from the opposition and finish off hitters with runners 
on base. He also has chafed at defensive gaffes and positional shifts with 
which he did not agree. He had trouble trusting his catchers to call pitches, 
especially those of Yadier Molina's, who is highly regarded in his game-calling 
skills. However, teammates and Cardinals officials have noticed that he 
has started to become more receptive to changing his strategy, and therefore,
