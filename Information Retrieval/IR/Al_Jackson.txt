Alvin Neill Jackson (born December 26, 1935), affectionately referred to 
as "Little" Al Jackson, is a former left-handed pitcher in Major League 
Baseball who played from 1959 to 1969. His 43 wins with the New York Mets 
were the franchise record until Tom Seaver eased past the mark in 1969. 
Listed at 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m), 169 pounds (77 kg), Jackson was born 
in Waco, Texas, and attended Wiley College. He was signed by the Pittsburgh 
Pirates as an amateur free agent in 1955 but his first regular major league 
experience came as a member of the inaugural 1962 New York Mets. As a starting 
pitcher, he posted an 8–20 record that year. The 40–120 record of those 
1962 Mets continues to be the most losses by a Major League team in a single 
season since the 19th Century. On the 14th of August 1962, Jackson pitched 
a complete game 3-1 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies in 4 hours 35 minutes 
– the longest complete game in terms of playing time in Major League history.[1] 
After three more seasons of sixteen or more losses with the Mets, including 
a second 8–20 campaign, Jackson was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for 
Ken Boyer.[2] In 1966, his first year in St. Louis, Jackson had his best 
season in the majors. He was sixth in the National League in earned run 
average and ninth in complete games. Unfortunately for Jackson, he also 
lost fifteen games and, the next year, was used more as a relief pitcher. 
Those 15 losses gave him a five-year streak of at least 15 losses—the record 
since 1900 is six. Despite going 9–4 in 1967, he did not see action in 
the 1967 World Series. After the 1967 season, Jackson was traded back to 
the Mets for pitcher Jack Lamabe and continued pitching out of the bullpen. 
He was with the "Miracle" Mets of 1969 but was sold to the Cincinnati Reds 
in June after compiling an ERA over ten, and never did play in a postseason. 
Jackson pitched 33 games for the Reds in relief to finish 1969. Before 
he played a game in 1970, the Reds released him and his career was over. 
In addition to his 43 wins as a Met, Jackson's franchise record of 10 shutouts 
was also broken by Seaver. Two of them (July 27, 1962 and October 2, 1964) 
were 1–0 wins over Bob Gibson—the Mets' first two victories over the future 
Hall-of-Famer and the only two times the Mets defeated him between 1962 
and 1966. He threw a one-hitter on June 22, 1962 against the Houston Colt 
.45s (who joined the Mets during the 1962 season), the first in Mets' history. 
The lone hit was by Joey Amalfitano in the first inning. After his playing 
days, Jackson fashioned a two-decades-plus-long career as a coach, serving 
as a pitching mentor at the big-league level with the Boston Red Sox (1977–79) 
under former Met teammate Don Zimmer and the Baltimore Orioles (1989–91) 
under Frank Robinson and Johnny Oates. However, he spent most of his tenure 
as a minor league instructor with the Mets, and was a member of Bobby Valentine's 
MLB staff in 1999–2000. Al Jackson and his wife Nadine have two sons Reggie 
and Barry and two grandsons Wesley Jackson and Kyle Jackson. He serves
