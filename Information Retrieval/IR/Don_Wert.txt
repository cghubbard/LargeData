Donald Ralph Wert (born July 29, 1938[1]), nicknamed "Coyote",[2][3] is 
an American former professional baseball player. He played as a third baseman 
in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers from 1963 to 1970 and also 
briefly played for the Washington Senators in 1971.[1] In 1965, he was 
named "Tiger of the Year", and in 1968, he was chosen for the American 
League All Star Team and won a World Series ring.[1][4][5] Born in Strasburg, 
Pennsylvania, in Lancaster County, Wert attended Franklin & Marshall College 
in Lancaster, Pennsylvania where he played baseball for the "Diplomats."[6] 
He was signed by the Detroit Tigers as an amateur free agent in 1958 and 
played several years in the minor leagues.[1] Wert reached the major leagues 
in 1963 at the age of 24 and became the Tigers' regular third baseman from 
1964–1970. Though never a strong hitter, Wert earned a reputation as one 
of the best fielding third basemen.[6] In 1965, Wert played all 162 games 
for the Tigers and led all American League third basemen with a .976 fielding 
percentage, marking the only year in the 1960s that a third baseman other 
than Brooks Robinson had led the league in fielding.[1][7] He also led 
the team with 159 hits, had a .341 on-base percentage fueled by a career-high 
73 walks, and even showed some power with hit 12 home runs.[1] With his 
performance in 1965, Wert was selected for the first annual "Tiger of the 
Year" by the Detroit chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, 
and also finished No. 10 in the American League Most Valuable Player voting.[4][8] 
Wert had his best season as a batter in 1966, when he had a .268 batting 
average, .342 on-base percentage, 20 doubles, 11 home runs, and 70 RBIs.[1] 
On June 24, 1968, during a game in which Jim Northrup hit two grand slams, 
Wert was beaned in the 6th inning by Cleveland Indians pitcher Hal Kurtz.[9] 
The pitch hit Wert in the head, shattering his batting helmet.[10] Wert 
was carried off on a stretcher, spent two nights in the hospital, missed 
several games, and was never the same hitter again. He had never hit lower 
than .257 in five prior seasons, but his batting average dropped to a career-low 
.200 in 1968, as he managed only 107 hits in 536 at bats.[1] Despite his 
low average, Wert was selected to the roster of the 1968 American League 
All Star Team by American League manager Dick Williams and doubled off 
Tom Seaver in the eighth inning, but was stranded in a 1-0 loss. He is 
remembered in Detroit for his 9th inning, game-winning hit on September 
17 to clinch the American League pennant.[11] Wert was mobbed by his teammates 
and fans came pouring onto the field after his pennant-winning single. 
Tigers broadcaster Ernie Harwell described the scene as follows in his 
radio broadcast of the game: On July 15, 1969 Detroit Tigers season|1969]], 
with President Richard Nixon attending the game in Washington, Wert started 
a triple play on a ground ball hit by Ed Brinkman.[12] On July 9, 1970, 
Wert was involved in a bizarre play when Dalton Jones hit a fly ball into 
the upper deck with the bases loaded.[13] What should have been a grand 
slam ended up being a three-RBI single, as Jones passed Wert between first 
and second base. Jones was called out. Jones later blamed Wert, noting 
that Wert should have been halfway to second base, prepared to advance 
if it was a home run, and prepared to return to first if it was caught. 
Instead, Jones recalled that Wert was returning to first to tag up, and 
Jones passed Wert just 1 or 2 steps past first base. On October 9, 1970, 
Wert and Denny McLain were traded to the Washington Senators in an eight-player 
deal that brought Ed Brinkman, Aurelio Rodríguez, and Joe Coleman to the 
Tigers.[14] Wert played 20 games for the Senators in 1971.[1] He was batting 
.050 (2 hits in 40 at bats) when he was released on June 24, 1971.[1] Over 
nine seasons in the major leagues, Wert played in 1,100 games and had a 
.242 batting average, 929 hits, 417 runs scored, 389 walks, 366 RBIs, 129 
doubles, and 77 home runs.[1] Wert played 1,043 of his games at third base
