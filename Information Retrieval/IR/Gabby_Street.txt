As player As manager Charles Evard "Gabby" Street (September 30, 1882 – 
February 6, 1951), also nicknamed "The Old Sarge", was an American catcher, 
manager, coach, and radio broadcaster in Major League Baseball during the 
first half of the 20th century. As a catcher, he participated in one of 
the most publicized baseball stunts of the century's first decade. As a 
manager, he led the St. Louis Cardinals to two National League championships 
(1930–31) and one world title (1931). And as a broadcaster, he entertained 
St. Louis baseball fans in the years following World War II. Born in Huntsville, 
Alabama, Street (who batted and threw right-handed) was a weak hitter. 
He batted only .208 in a seven-year playing career (1904–05; 1908–12) in 
502 games with the Cincinnati Reds, Boston Beaneaters, Washington Senators, 
and New York Highlanders. Apart from 1908 to 1909, when he was the Senators' 
first-string catcher, he was a part-time player. Street holds the record 
for the longest gap between Major League games – 19 years (1912–1931).[1] 
However, on August 21, 1908, Street achieved a measure of immortality by 
catching a baseball dropped from the top of the Washington Monument—a distance 
of 555 feet (169 m). After muffing the first twelve balls thrown by journalist 
Preston Gibson, he made a clean reception of number thirteen. In addition, 
Street was fabled as an early catcher and mentor of the American League's 
nonpareil right-handed pitcher, Walter Johnson. After Street's playing 
career ended, he managed in the minor leagues before joining the Cardinals' 
major league coaching staff in 1929. It was a year of turmoil for the defending 
NL champs. They replaced 1928 skipper Bill McKechnie before the season 
with Billy Southworth; then, when Southworth couldn’t get results, they 
brought back McKechnie on July 24. In between, Street served as acting 
manager for one game on July 23: an 8–2 triumph over the Philadelphia Phillies.[2] 
At the close of the 1929 season, McKechnie left to manage the Boston Braves 
and Street became the Redbirds' full-fledged manager. The Old Sarge promptly 
led the Cardinals to consecutive National League pennants. In 1930, they 
won 92 games and finished two games in front of the Chicago Cubs. But in 
the 1930 World Series, they faced the defending world champion Philadelphia 
Athletics and lost in six games. In 1931, Street's Cardinals won 101 games 
and bested the New York Giants by 13 games. Then, in the 1931 Series against 
those same A's, pitchers Wild Bill Hallahan and Burleigh Grimes dominated 
and Pepper Martin had 12 hits, batted .500, drove in five runs and stole 
five bases to lead the underdog Redbirds to a seven-game world championship 
against the last Connie Mack dynasty. The Cardinals faltered in 1932, winning 
only 72 games and finishing tied for sixth, 18 games out, and had improved 
only to fifth in July 1933. Street was dumped and replaced by his second 
baseman, Frankie Frisch. He managed in the AA American Association for 
a couple of seasons, then made a return to the Mound City as skipper of 
the 1938 St. Louis Browns. The habitually bottom-feeding Brownies finished 
seventh in an eight-team American League, winning only 53 games. The '38 
season put a cap on Street's major league managerial career. In all or 
parts of six years, he won 365 and lost 332 (.524).[3] Street would return 
to St. Louis and the major leagues, however, as a color commentator for 
Cardinals and Browns radio broadcasts after the Second World War, working 
with young colleague Harry Caray. After battling cancer successfully in 
1949, Street fell victim to heart failure in his adopted hometown of Joplin,
