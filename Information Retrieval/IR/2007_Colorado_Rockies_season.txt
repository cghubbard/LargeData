The Colorado Rockies' 2007 season started off with the team trying to improve 
on their 2006 record (76-86). They finished with a franchise record of 
90 wins in 163 games and earned a playoff berth as the National League 
Wild Card team. The team's stretch run was among the greatest ever for 
a Major League Baseball team. Having a record of 76-72 at the start of 
play on September 16, the Rockies proceeded to win 14 of their final 15 
regular season games.[1] The stretch culminated with a 9-8, 13-inning victory 
over the San Diego Padres in a one-game playoff for the wild card berth, 
a game that is considered to be part of the regular season. The Rockies 
then swept their first seven playoff games to win the 2007 National League 
Pennant â€” the franchise's first-ever pennant. Thus, at the start of the 
World Series, the Rockies had won a total of 21 out of 22 games. The amazing 
streak then ended, as the Rockies were swept in the 2007 World Series by 
the Boston Red Sox. The Rockies drew 2,376,250 fans for the season, their 
highest total since 2002. The average home attendance was 28,978. Infielders

73 losses. They were tied with the San Diego Padres for second place in 
the NL West and first in the NL Wild Card. A tie-breaker game was played 
on October 1, 2007, at Coors Field in Denver to determine which team would 
continue on to post-season play. The game lasted 13 innings, spanning four 
hours and 40 minutes. The Rockies won the game with a final score of 9 
to 8, sending them to only their second post-season in franchise history. 
The tie-breaker game counts toward all team and player statistics in the 
regular season; so, the Rockies' official 2007 win-loss record stands at

the Philadelphia Phillies on October 3, 2007, at Citizens Bank Park. The 
Phillies had a potent offense with NL MVP candidates Ryan Howard, Jimmy 
Rollins and Chase Utley. The Rockies swept the series in three games with 
scores of 4-2 in Game 1 and 10-5 in Game 2 in Philadelphia. In Game 3, 
with the score tied in the bottom of the 8th and two outs, Jeff Baker singled 
to bring in the go-ahead run. Manny Corpas then pitched a perfect ninth 
inning to seal the Rockies' first postseason series victory. Colorado started 
the series with the Arizona Diamondbacks on October 11, 2007, at Chase 
Field in Phoenix, Arizona. The Diamondbacks came into the game having swept 
the Chicago Cubs in the NLDS in three games. Colorado took the first two 
games, including a 3-2 extra-inning victory in Game 2. On Sunday, October 
14, the Rockies would play in a cold, wet Coors Field in Denver. There, 
they would find a way to hit the ball over the wall even in the harsh weather. 
The Rockies hit two homers that night, one in the 1st inning from Matt 
Holliday and the other in the 6th inning from Yorvit Torrealba. Colorado 
won the game 4-1. This win gave the Rockies a 20-1 record over their last 
21 games. This made them only the third team in the last half-century, 
and the first in the National League since the 1936, to have a 20-1 stretch 
at any point of a season.[22] Colorado won its first NL Pennant on Monday, 
October 15, at home, with the deciding blow, a 3-run HR by Matt Holliday, 
to sweep the AZ Diamondbacks (6-4) in the midst of a historic 21-1 sprint 
with only one loss (September 28) since September 15. Matt Holliday was 
the 2007 NLCS MVP Award winner. The Rockies became the first team to win 
their first 7 playoff games in 31 years. It should also be noted that they 
also became the first team to do it since MLB added the division series 
to the playoffs. The 2014 Kansas City Royals passed the record with winning 
their first 8 playoff games in the wild card game, the ALDS, and the ALCS. 
The Rockies lost the first two games at Fenway Park, by a score of 13-1 
in Game One and a score of 2-1 in Game Two. The 13 runs are the most ever 
scored by a team in the first game of a World Series. Returning to Coors 
Field for the final two games, the Rockies lost Game Three by a score of
