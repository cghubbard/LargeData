The Pittsburgh Penguins are an American professional ice hockey team based 
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that competes in the National Hockey League 
(NHL). They are members of the league's Metropolitan Division of the Eastern 
Conference. The franchise was founded in 1967 as one of the first expansion 
teams during the league's original expansion from six to twelve teams. 
The Penguins played in the Civic Arena, also known to Pittsburgh fans as 
"The Igloo", from the time of their inception through the end of the 2009–10 
season. They moved into their new arena, PPG Paints Arena, to begin the 
2010–11 NHL season. They have qualified for five Stanley Cup Finals, winning 
the Stanley Cup four times – in 1991, 1992, 2009, and 2016. Before the 
Penguins, Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHL's Pirates from 1925 to 
1930 and of the American Hockey League Hornets franchise from 1936 to 1967 
(with a short break from 1956 to 1961). In the spring of 1965, Jack McGregor, 
a state senator from Kittanning, began lobbying campaign contributors and 
community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group 
focused on leveraging the NHL as an urban renewal tool for Pittsburgh. 
The senator formed a group of local investors that included H. J. Heinz 
Company heir H. J. Heinz III, Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney, and 
the Mellon family's Richard Mellon Scaife. The projected league expansion 
depended on securing votes from the then-current NHL owners; to ensure 
that Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor 
enlisted Rooney to petition votes from James D. Norris, owner of the Chicago 
Black Hawks, and his brother Bruce Norris, owner of the Detroit Red Wings. 
The effort was successful, and on February 8, 1966, the National Hockey 
League awarded an expansion team to Pittsburgh for the 1967–68 season. 
The Penguins paid $2.5 million ($18.5 million today) for their entry and 
$750,000 ($5.3 million today) more for start-up costs. The Civic Arena's 
capacity was then boosted from 10,732 to 12,500 to meet the NHL requirements 
for expansion. The Pens also paid an indemnification bill to settle with 
the Detroit Red Wings, which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise. The 
investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer, and 
he represented Pittsburgh on the NHL's Board of Governors.[3] A contest 
was held where 700 of 26,000 entries picked "Penguins" as the nickname 
for the team. Mark Peters had the winning entry (which was inspired by 
the fact that the team was to play in the "Igloo," the nickname of the 
Pittsburgh Civic Arena),[4][5] a logo was chosen that had a penguin in 
front of a triangle, which symbolized the "Golden Triangle" of downtown 
Pittsburgh."[4][6] The Penguins' first general manager, Jack Riley opened 
the first preseason camp for the franchise in Brantford, Ontario[7] on 
September 13, 1967, playing the franchise's first exhibition match in Brantford 
against the Philadelphia Flyers on September 23, 1967. The Pens, along 
with the rest of the expansion teams, were hampered by restrictive rules 
which kept most major talent with the existing "Original Six" teams. Beyond 
aging sniper Andy Bathgate, All-Star defenseman Leo Boivin (who had begun 
his professional career with the Hornets) and Ranger veteran Earl Ingarfield, 
the first Penguins team was largely manned by a cast of former minor leaguers. 
A number of the players had played for the Hornets the previous season: 
Bathgate, wingers Val Fonteyne and Ab McDonald, and goaltenders Hank Bassen 
and Joe Daley. George Sullivan was named the head coach for the club's 
first two seasons, and McDonald was named the team's first captain. On 
October 11, 1967, league president Clarence Campbell and McGregor jointly 
dropped the ceremonial first puck of the Penguins opening home game against 
the Montreal Canadiens.[3] On October 21, 1967, they became the first team 
from the expansion class to beat an Original Six team, as they defeated 
the Chicago Black Hawks 4–2. However, the Penguins went 27–34–13 and finished 
in fifth place in the West Division, missing the playoffs and ending with 
the third worst record in the league. The team's best player proved to 
be longtime Cleveland Barons AHL goaltender Les Binkley, who recorded a 
2.88 goals against average and was second in the league in shutouts with 
six. Defensive winger Ken Schinkel won the team's sole league honor, being 
named to represent the Penguins in the NHL All-Star Game. Bathgate led 
the team in scoring with 59 points, but retired at season's end. McDonald, 
who led the team in goals and was second in team scoring, was also gone 
at season's end, traded to St. Louis for center Lou Angotti. The next season, 
1968–69, saw the team slip in the standings in the midst of a sharp drop 
in form by Binkley, into sixth place and with the league's worst record. 
Several changes were made to try to improve the team, resulting in Boivin 
and several others being traded, and new players—including longtime future 
Pens star Jean Pronovost—making their debuts. No captain was named to replace 
McDonald, and the team went with four alternate captains. Schinkel was 
again the team's lone All-Star. With the exception of a handful of decent 
players such as Ken Schinkel, Jean Pronovost, Syl Apps Jr., Keith McCreary, 
agitator Bryan Watson and goaltender Les Binkley, talent was otherwise 
thin, but enough for the Penguins to reach the playoffs in both 1970 and 
1972. In the 1969 draft the Penguins selected Michel Briere who although 
being chosen 26th soon was drawing comparisons to Phil Esposito and Bobby 
Clarke. Joining the team in November, he finished as the second place rookie 
scorer in the NHL (behind Bobby Clarke) with 44 points (57th overall), 
and third on the Penguins. Briere placed second in Calder Memorial Trophy 
voting for Rookie of the Year honors to Chicago goalie Tony Esposito in 
leading Pittsburgh to its first NHL playoff berth since the 1928 Pirates. 
The Penguins defeated the Oakland Seals in a four-game sweep in the quarter-finals, 
with Briere scoring the series-clinching goal in overtime. In the semi-final 
round, defending conference champions St. Louis Blues got the best of the 
Penguins during six games. Briere led the team in playoff scoring, recording 
five goals (including three game winners) and eight points. Tragedy struck 
the Penguins just days after their playoff heroics. On May 15, 1970, Briere 
was in a car crash in his native Quebec, suffering brain trauma and going 
into a coma from which he would never recover, dying a year later. His 
#21 jersey was never reissued, remaining out of circulation for the Penguins 
until it was formally retired in 2001. The next season the Penguins finished 
five games out of the playoffs with a 21–37–20 record, the fourth worst 
record in the league. Pittsburgh achieved a playoff berth in 1972 only 
to be swept by the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round. The Penguins 
battled the California Golden Seals for the division cellar in 1974, when 
Riley was fired as general manager and replaced with Jack Button. Button 
traded for Steve Durbano, Ab DeMarco, Bob "Battleship" Kelly and Bob Paradise. 
The personnel moves proved successful, as the team improved to a 28–41–9 
record, although they remained nine points away from a playoff berth. In 
early 1975, however, the Penguins' creditors demanded payment of back debts, 
forcing the team into bankruptcy. The doors to the team's offices were 
padlocked, and it looked like the Penguins might fold or relocate.[citation 
needed] Around the same time, rumors had begun to circulate that the Penguins 
and California Golden Seals were to be relocated to Seattle and Denver 
respectively, the two cities that were to have been the sites of an expansion 
for the 1976–77 season.[8] Through the intervention of a group that included 
former Minnesota North Stars head coach Wren Blair, the team was prevented 
from folding and remained in Pittsburgh, eventually being bought by shopping 
mall magnate Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. Beginning in the mid-'70s, Pittsburgh 
iced some powerful offensive clubs, led by the likes of the "Century Line" 
of Syl Apps, Lowell MacDonald and Jean Pronovost. They nearly reached the 
Stanley Cup semifinals in 1975, but were ousted from the playoffs by the 
New York Islanders in one of the only four best-of-seven game series in 
NHL history where a team came back from being down three games to none. 
As the 1970s wore on, the Penguins brought in other offensive weapons such 
as Rick Kehoe, Pierre Larouche and Ron Schock, along with solid blue-liners 
Ron Stackhouse and Dave Burrows. But the Pens' success beyond the regular 
season was always neutralized by mediocre team defense. Goaltender Denis 
Herron was a stalwart in goal for parts of six seasons. Aldege "Baz" Bastien, 
a former coach and general manager of the AHL Hornets, later became general 
manager. The Penguins missed the playoffs in 1977–78 when their offense 
lagged, and Larouche was traded for Peter Mahovlich and Peter Lee. Bastien 
traded prime draft choices for several players whose best years were already 
behind them, such as Orest Kindrachuk, Tom Bladon and Rick MacLeish, and 
the team would suffer in the early 1980s as a result. The decade closed 
with a playoff appearance in 1979 and a rousing opening series win over 
the Buffalo Sabres before a second-round sweep at the hands of the Boston 
Bruins. The Penguins began the 1980s by changing their team colors. In 
January 1980, the team switched from wearing blue and white to their present-day 
scheme of black and gold to honor Pittsburgh's other sports teams, the 
Pirates and the Steelers, as well as the Flag of Pittsburgh. Both the Pirates 
and Steelers had worn black and gold for decades, and both were fresh off 
world championship seasons at that time. The Bruins protested this color 
change, claiming a monopoly on black and gold, but the Penguins defended 
their choice by stating that the NHL Pirates also used black and gold as 
their team colors, and that black and gold were Pittsburgh's traditional 
sporting colors. The NHL agreed, and Pittsburgh was allowed to use black 
and gold. The Penguins officially debuted wearing black and gold against 
the St. Louis Blues at the Civic Arena on January 30, 1980.[9] On the ice, 
the Penguins began the 1980s with defenseman Randy Carlyle, and prolific 
scorers Paul Gardner and Mike Bullard, but little else. During the early 
part of the decade, the Penguins made a habit of being a tough draw for 
higher-seeded opponents in the playoffs. In 1980, the 13th seeded Penguins 
took the Bruins to the limit in their first round playoff series. The following 
season, as the 15th seed, they lost the decisive game of their first-round 
series in overtime to the heavily favored St. Louis Blues. Then, in the 
1982 playoffs, the Penguins held a 3–1 lead late in the fifth and final 
game of their playoff series against the reigning champions, the New York 
Islanders. However, the Islanders rallied to force overtime and won the 
series on a goal by John Tonelli. It would be the Pens' final playoff appearance 
until 1989. The team had the league's worst record in both the 1983 and 
1984 seasons, and with the team suffering financial problems, it again 
looked as though the Penguins would either fold or relocate. Mario Lemieux, 
one of the most highly touted NHL draft picks in history, was due to be 
drafted in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft. Heading towards the end of the season 
ahead of the New Jersey Devils, who were placed last, the Penguins made 
a number of questionable moves that appeared to weaken the team in the 
short-term. The Penguins posted three six-game winless streaks in the last 
21 games of the season and earned the right to draft Lemieux amidst protests 
from Devils management.[10] Pittsburgh coach Lou Angotti later admitted 
that a conscious decision was made to finish the season as the team with 
the worst record, stating in an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
that a mid-season lunch prompted the plan, in light of the fact that there 
was a high chance of the franchise folding if Lemieux was not drafted.[11] 
In particular, Angotti gave the example of a game the Penguins were winning 
3–1, at which point general manager Eddie Johnston asked the coach "what 
are you doing?" in the first intermission of the game that was eventually 
lost 6–3. The Penguins were still, despite losing ten of their last twelve 
games, only two games away from losing Lemieux to the Devils.[11] However, 
Angotti stated that he did not feel comfortable with the plan, even though 
it worked and saved the franchise. Other teams offered substantial trade 
packages for the draft choice, but the Penguins kept the pick and drafted 
Lemieux first overall. Lemieux paid dividends right away, scoring on his 
first ever shot of his first ever NHL shift, in his first NHL game. However, 
the team spent four more years out of the playoffs after his arrival. In 
the late 1980s, the Penguins finally gave Lemieux a strong supporting cast, 
trading for superstar defenseman Paul Coffey from the Edmonton Oilers (after 
the Oilers' 1987 Stanley Cup win) and bringing in young talent such as 
scorers Kevin Stevens, Rob Brown and John Cullen from the minors. Also, 
the team at last acquired a top-flight goaltender with the acquisition 
of Tom Barrasso from Buffalo. All this talent had an immediate impact in 
helping Lemieux lead the Pens; but the Penguins struggled to make the playoffs. 
The 1985–86 Pens unluckily missed the playoffs on the final day of the 
season by one game. In 1986–87 the Penguins missed the playoffs by just 
two games and saw four teams with equal or worse records qualify. In 1987–88 
the team again missed the playoffs on the last day of the season by one 
game. In 1989, Pittsburgh finally broke through the barrier and made the 
playoffs, on the back of Lemieux leading the league in goals, assists and 
points. On December 31, 1988, Lemieux became the only player in history 
to score a goal in all five possible game situations in the same game (even 
strength, shorthanded, penalty shot, power play, and empty net). The Pens 
shocked the New York Rangers in a four-game sweep in the first round, however 
their run was halted by the Philadelphia Flyers in the second round. The 
seven game defeat featured Mario Lemieux scoring five goals in the fifth 
game. A herniated disc in Lemieux's back cut short his 1989–90 NHL season, 
although he still amassed 123 points. However, the Penguins fell out of 
the playoff picture. The Penguins opted to strengthen their roster and 
support Lemieux in the 1990 off-season. Free agent signings (Bryan Trottier) 
and trades (Joe Mullen, Larry Murphy, Ron Francis and Ulf Samuelsson) played 
a major part of this. Arguably no move was bigger during this time than 
when the Penguins drafted Jaromir Jagr with the 5th overall pick in the 
1990 NHL Entry Draft. The first Czechoslovakian player to be drafted into 
the NHL without first needing to defect to the West, Jagr became the Penguins' 
second franchise player, and quickly developed into a superstar offensive 
talent. The roster overhaul culminated in the Penguins winning their first 
Stanley Cup by defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the Stanley Cup Finals 
in six games, punctuated by an 8–0 victory in the deciding game, the largest 
margin of victory in a final Cup game in over 80 years. After the 1991 
Stanley Cup Finals, the Penguins met with President George H. W. Bush, 
the first NHL team to ever visit the White House.[12] The following season, 
the team lost coach Bob Johnson to cancer, and Scotty Bowman took over 
as coach. Under Bowman, they swept the Chicago Blackhawks to repeat as 
Stanley Cup champions in 1991–92. Cancer revisited the Penguins in 1993 
when Lemieux was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. Only two months after 
the diagnosis, missing 24 out of 84 games, he came back to win his fourth 
Art Ross Trophy as scoring champion with 160 points, edging out Pat LaFontaine 
and Adam Oates. Despite the off-ice difficulties, Pittsburgh finished with 
a 56–21–7 record, the franchise's best regular season ever, winning the 
franchise's first (and, as of 2016, only) Presidents' Trophy. After Lemieux's 
return, the team played better than it ever had before, winning an NHL-record 
17 consecutive games. Despite all of this success, they were eliminated 
in the second round by the New York Islanders in overtime of Game 7. The 
Penguins continued to be a formidable team throughout the 1990s. The stars 
of the Stanley Cup years were followed by the likes of forwards Alexei 
Kovalev, Martin Straka, Aleksey Morozov, Robert Lang and Petr Nedved, and 
defensemen Sergei Zubov, Darius Kasparaitis and Kevin Hatcher. Despite 
the departure of many of the franchise's Cup Champion roster, the Penguins 
fielded enough talent to reach the first round of the playoffs in 1994, 
the second round in 1995, and the conference finals in 1996. 1997 marked 
a turning point, as the Penguins suffered a first-round elimination at 
the hands of the rival Philadelphia Flyers in five games. The franchise 
was rocked on April 6, 1997 when Mario Lemieux, citing ongoing health concerns, 
and disapproval with the way NHL hockey was being officiated, announced 
he would retire at the conclusion of the 1996-1997 post-season. Lemieux 
was so respected in the NHL, and his achievements over the course of his 
career were so great, that he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame 
in the same year as he retired, the three-year waiting period being waived. 
His departure would essentially be the first in a series of events that 
would lead the Penguins once again into regular season stagnation, and 
to the brink of financial ruin. The team was eliminated in the first round 
of the playoffs in 1998 despite being the second-seeded team in the East. 
The following year, their post-season run ended in the second round. In 
2000, the Penguins stunned the highly touted Washington Capitals 4–1 in 
the first round only to fall to the Philadelphia Flyers 4–2 in the second 
round. At this point, the lofty contracts handed out during the early 1990s 
were beginning to catch up with the franchise. Their free-spending ways 
culminated in the team owing in excess of $90 million to various creditors. 
Then-owners Howard Baldwin and Morris Belzberg (who bought the Penguins 
after their first Cup win) asked the players to defer their salaries to 
help pay the bills. When the deferred salaries finally came due, combined 
with other financial pressures, the Penguins were forced to file for Chapter 
11 bankruptcy in November 1998. At this point, Lemieux stepped in with 
an unusual proposal to buy the team out of bankruptcy. The Penguins owed 
Lemieux $32.5 million in deferred salary, making him the team's largest 
individual creditor. He proposed to recover this money by converting it 
into equity—enough to give him controlling interest over the team. He also 
vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The League and the court agreed, 
and Lemieux, with help from supermarket tycoon Ronald Burkle, assumed control 
on September 3, 1999, thus saving the franchise for the second time. Lemieux 
once again shocked the hockey world by announcing at a press conference 
on December 8, 2000 his intentions to return to the Penguins as an active 
player. On December 27, 2000, Lemieux stepped onto NHL ice for the first 
time in 44 months, officially becoming the first player–owner in NHL history. 
Lemieux helped lead the Penguins deep into the 2001 playoffs, highlighted 
by an overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres in Game 7 of the second 
round. Darius Kasparaitis scored the series-clinching goal to advance the 
Penguins to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they lost in five games 
to the New Jersey Devils. The Penguins' attendance had dwindled in the 
late 1990s. In 1998–99, the Penguins had an average attendance of 14,825 
at home games, the lowest it had been since Lemieux's rookie year.[13] 
Reducing revenue on top of the previous bankruptcy necessitated salary 
shedding. The biggest salary move was the trading of superstar Jaromir 
Jagr to the Washington Capitals in the summer of 2001. The return for Jagr 
was mediocre, at best, as the Penguins received prospects Kris Beech, Michal 
Sivek and Ross Lupaschuk. The Penguins missed the playoffs for the first 
time in 12 years in 2002, finishing in a tie for third-to-last in the conference. 
Further financial difficulties saw them trade Alexei Kovalev to the New 
York Rangers the next season, quickly followed by the free agency departure 
of Robert Lang. The 2002–03 season was even worse, with the team finishing 
second-last in the Conference. The situation began to echo the dark days 
of the early 1980s. However, just like in the 1980s, the Penguins used 
the opportunity to rebuild through the draft and acquire elite prospects. 
In the 2003 NHL Entry Draft, the Penguins selected goaltender Marc-Andre 
Fleury with the first overall pick. The 2003–04 season was an ordeal with 
Lemieux missing all but 24 regular season games with a hip injury, and 
attendance dipping to an average of 11,877 (the lowest average out of any 
NHL team), with just one sellout.[13] As the season progressed, the Penguins 
signed new head coach (and former Penguins player and commentator) Eddie 
Olczyk, traded Martin Straka to the Los Angeles Kings and opted not to 
include the highly rated Fleury in the lineup for the bulk of the 2003–04 
season. This culminated in the worst record in the NHL, as they won just 
23 games. As in the 80s, the Penguins struggles were fortuitously concurrent 
with a string of NHL Entry Draft classes that would yield multiple world-class 
talents. The Penguins lost out on the first overall pick for the 2004 NHL 
Entry Draft which went to the Washington Capitals. As expected, the Capitals 
made Russian superstar Alexander Ovechkin, the top pick. However, Ovechkin's 
countryman, center Evgeni Malkin, was similarly highly regarded, and Pittsburgh 
took him with the #2 overall pick. By this point, the Penguins had collapsed 
financially since the Stanley Cup-winning years of the early 1990s. Their 
home venue, the Civic Arena had become the oldest and was widely regarded 
as the worst NHL arena in the league, and Lemieux had tried unsuccessfully 
to cut a deal with the city for a new facility. With Pittsburgh uninterested 
in building a new hockey arena for the struggling Penguins, Lemieux began 
looking into the possibilities of selling and/or relocating the team to 
Kansas City, Missouri.[14] The 2004–05 NHL season was canceled due to the 
NHL lockout. One of the many reasons for the lockout included disagreements 
on the resolution of the financial struggles of teams like the Penguins 
and the Ottawa Senators, who had filed for bankruptcy protection.[15] In 
the midst of the lockout, the Penguins dispersed between the club's American 
Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and 
to European leagues. Alexei Morozov and Milan Kraft elected not to return 
to the Penguins after the lockout, opting instead to remain playing in 
Europe. With the lockout resolved in 2005, the League organized an unprecedented 
draft lottery to set the 2005 NHL Entry Draft selection order. The draft 
lottery, which was held behind closed doors in a "secure location," resulted 
in the Penguins being awarded the first overall pick for the second time 
in three years.[16] The entry draft that year was being touted as having 
the greatest rookie class since Lemieux, himself, had been drafted. Quebec 
Major Junior Hockey League superstar Sidney Crosby (who had been training 
with Lemieux over the summer[16]) was the consensus #1 overall pick, with 
many referring to the draft lottery process as "The Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes". 
The Penguins selected Crosby on July 30, 2005 with the top pick, instantly 
rekindling interest in hockey in Pittsburgh. The Penguins then began rebuilding 
the team under the salary cap. They signed free agents Sergei Gonchar, 
John LeClair, and Zigmund Palffy, and traded for goaltender Jocelyn Thibault. 
However, Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' 2004 draft pick, second overall, 
could not report to Pittsburgh immediately due to a playing rights dispute 
with the Russian Superleague (RSL). The addition of Crosby paid instant 
dividends, with attendance rising by approximately 4,000 on average in 
the 2005–06 season.[13] However, Crosby's presence did not immediately 
translate into wins, as the team began the season with a long winless skid 
that resulted in a head coaching change from Olczyk to Michel Therrien. 
Palffy announced his retirement mid-season due to a lingering shoulder 
injury whilst the team's second-leading scorer. Then, on January 24, 2006, 
Lemieux announced his second retirement, this time permanently, after developing 
an irregular heart beat. He finished as the NHL's seventh all-time scorer 
(1,723), eighth in goals (690) and tenth in assists (1,033), but also with 
the second highest career points per game average (1.88), which is second 
to Wayne Gretzky's 1.92.[17][18] Despite the team's various struggles, 
Crosby lived up to the hype and became an instant superstar amassing 102 
points in his debut season and finishing second to Washington's Alexander 
Ovechkin for the Calder Memorial Trophy awarded each year to the league's 
top rookie. In the Penguins' final game of the season, Crosby tallied a 
goal and an assist to become the top scoring rookie in Penguins history 
(eclipsing Lemieux). The Penguins once again posted the worst record in 
the Eastern Conference and the highest goals-against total in the League. 
They received the second overall draft pick, their fourth top two pick 
in four years, in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft and selected touted two-way 
forward Jordan Staal. The team announced on April 20 that the contract 
for General Manager Craig Patrick would not be renewed. Patrick had been 
GM since December 1989. On May 25, Ray Shero signed a five-year contract 
as general manager. Change came for the Penguins on October 18, 2006, when 
rookie Evgeni Malkin made his NHL debut. He went on to set the modern NHL 
record with a goal in each of his first six games. On February 27, 2007, 
the Penguins acquired Gary Roberts from the Florida Panthers and Georges 
Laraque from Phoenix Coyotes. Malkin would go on to tally points in 16 
consecutive games with 14 wins and two overtime losses in early 2007. The 
streak ended on February 19 with a last-minute loss to the New York Islanders.[19] 
It was the second-longest point streak in club history. On March 13, 2007, 
Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan 
Onorato, Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and Mario Lemieux of the Pittsburgh 
Penguins ownership group, publicly announced that an agreement had been 
reached among the parties to build the long sought arena. The state-of-the-art, 
multi-purpose facility, the Consol Energy Center, guaranteed that the Penguins 
would remain in the city of Pittsburgh. Following the announcement of the 
plan, the Lemieux ownership group announced that they no longer had plans 
to sell the team. On June 8, 2007, a $325 million bond was issued and the 
Penguins signed a 30-year lease, binding the Penguins to the city of Pittsburgh 
through 2040; the lease agreement was signed on September 19. On May 6, 
2008, the Pittsburgh planning commission unanimously approved the final 
design. The arena includes a glass atrium overlooking downtown Pittsburgh 
and rooftop lights shining into the sky. The new $290 million dollar arena 
was expected to open in time for the 2010–11 season.[20] On August 14, 
2008, the ground breaking ceremony for the new arena was held, thus officially 
beginning construction on the new facility. On December 15, 2008, it was 
announced by the Penguins they had entered into an agreement with Consol 
Energy on a 21-year deal for naming rights to the new arena. The Penguins 
finished the 2006–07 season in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with 
a record of 47–24–11, totaling 105 points, only two points behind the Atlantic 
Division winners, the New Jersey Devils. It was the franchise's first 100-point 
season in 11 years, and represented an enormous 47-point leap from the 
previous season. In the first round of the 2007 Stanley Cup playoffs, the 
Penguins were defeated 4–1 by the eventual Stanley Cup runners-up, the 
Ottawa Senators. At the season's end, rookies Evgeni Malkin and Jordan 
Staal were finalists for the Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the Rookie 
of the Year, which Malkin won. After a mediocre start to the 2007–08 season, 
Sidney Crosby and starting goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury were both injured 
long-term due to high right ankle sprains. In their absence, the Penguins 
flourished due to the play and leadership of center Evgeni Malkin and backup 
goaltender Ty Conklin. The Penguins markedly improved in January, and fell 
no lower than the third seed in the East from that point onward. On February 
26, the Penguins would acquire the Atlanta Thrashers' star right winger 
Marian Hossa and forward Pascal Dupuis at the NHL trade deadline, relinquishing 
Colby Armstrong, Erik Christensen, Angelo Esposito and a first-round pick 
in 2008. The Penguins also acquired defensemen Hal Gill from the Toronto 
Maple Leafs for a second-round pick in 2008 and a fifth-round pick in 2009. 
On April 2, 2008, the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division title—their 
first division title in 10 years—with a 4–2 win against rivals the Philadelphia 
Flyers. However, they closed the season with a loss to the Flyers on the 
next night, relegating them to the second seed in the East behind the Montreal 
Canadiens. The Pens had spent most of the second half going back-and-forth 
with the Habs for first place in the East. Evgeni Malkin finished the season 
with 106 points for second place in the League, behind only Washington's 
Alexander Ovechkin, and also finished as a finalist for the Hart Memorial 
Trophy. This was the first time that neither the New Jersey Devils nor 
the Philadelphia Flyers won the Atlantic Division since the New York Rangers 
won the inaugural one, when they won the 1994 Stanley Cup. The team launched 
into their first extended playoff run in many years, beating Ottawa 4–0, 
defeating the New York Rangers 4–1 and then defeating the Philadelphia 
Flyers 4–1 to clinch the Prince of Wales Trophy. Pittsburgh went on to 
lose the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals to the Detroit Red Wings in six games, 
finishing the playoffs with a 14–6 record. Sidney Crosby finished the playoffs 
with 27 points (6 goals and 21 assists in 20 games), tying Conn Smythe 
Trophy-winner Henrik Zetterberg (13 goals and 14 assists in 22 games) for 
the playoff scoring lead. In the 2008–09 season, Malkin won the Art Ross 
by narrowly defeating rival Alexander Ovechkin in the points race and was 
a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy for MVP. Crosby finished third 
in League scoring with 33 goals and 70 assists for 103 points, despite 
missing five games. The Penguins' record dipped mid-season but lifted after 
Head Coach Michel Therrien was replaced by Dan Bylsma and defenseman Sergei 
Gonchar returned from injury. The effect was almost instantaneous and the 
Penguins recovered enough to secure home ice advantage in their first round 
matchup against the Philadelphia Flyers, whom the Penguins defeated in 
six games. The next series, against Washington, took all seven games for 
the Penguins to win, sending them to the Eastern Conference Finals, where 
they dispatched the Carolina Hurricanes in a four-game sweep. After defeating 
the Hurricanes, the Penguins earned their second consecutive trip to the 
Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings, to whom they had lost 
the previous Cup. After losing Games 1 and 2 in Detroit, just like the 
previous years, the Penguins won Games 3 and 4 in Pittsburgh. Each team 
won on home ice in Games 5 and 6. In Game 7 in Detroit, Maxime Talbot scored 
two goals, including the game-winner, as the Penguins won 2–1 to earn their 
third Stanley Cup.[21] Malkin's dominant playoff performance was rewarded 
by the Conn Smythe Trophy. On Friday, October 2, 2009, the Penguins opened 
the 2009–10 season against the New York Rangers. It was the last home opener 
at the Mellon Arena and it was also the night the team raised the Stanley 
Cup championship banner to the arena's rafters. The Penguins started the 
season by winning a franchise-record seven road games to start a season.[22] 
For the second-straight year, the Penguins finished the season in second 
place, behind New Jersey. Crosby scored 109 points (51 goals and 58 assists) 
in 81 games, finishing second in scoring to Henrik Sedin's 112 points (29 
goals, 83 assists) from 82 games. Crosby's 51 goals also earned him the 
Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy, awarded to the NHL season's leading goalscorer. 
The Penguins, seeded fourth in the East, began their title defense against 
the Ottawa Senators. Losing Game 1 by a score of 5–4, the team went on 
to win the next three games. With the Penguins up 3–1 in their series, 
they looked to close out the series in Game 5, which was ultimately won 
by Ottawa in triple overtime. The Penguins then won Game 6 in overtime, 
despite an early-game 3–0 deficit. In the next round, the Penguins faced 
the Montreal Canadiens. The teams would swap wins in the series en route 
to the decisive Game 7, which the Penguins lost 5–2, ending their season 
and their tenure at Mellon Arena. Coincidentally, the Canadiens opened 
and closed the Mellon Arena with wins. In 2010–11, the Penguins played 
their first game in the Consol Energy Center, a loss to their rivals the 
Philadelphia Flyers. The start of the season was reasonably successful, 
and the Penguins played in the NHL Winter Classic versus the Washington 
Capitals. However, the season was marred by a season-ending concussion 
and knee injury to Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, respectively. After 
some difficulties, the Penguins managed to cope with the key losses, particularly 
through the enhanced play of Jordan Staal and a 10–3 record in shootouts, 
and ended up second in the Atlantic Division behind the Philadelphia Flyers. 
Despite this success, the Penguins made an early exit in the playoffs, 
losing the series after taking a 3–1 series lead over the Tampa Bay Lightning, 
with the goaltending of Marc-Andre Fleury called into question. With Sidney 
Crosby still sidelined with post-concussion syndrome, at the start of the 
2011–12 season, Evgeni Malkin led the Penguins' top line and dominated 
league scoring. He finished with 50 goals and 109 points as the Penguins 
earned 51 wins on the season. The Penguins' offense was reinforced by the 
breakout performances of James Neal, who scored 40 goals, and Jordan Staal, 
who set a career high in points while missing significant time with injuries. 
With Malkin's Art Ross-winning performance and Crosby's late-season return 
from injury, the Penguins headed into the 2012 playoffs with high hopes 
of making a significant Cup run. However, the highly favored Penguins were 
defeated in six games by their cross-state rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, 
after falling into a 0–3 series hole.[23] Malkin was later awarded the 
Hart Memorial Trophy and Lester B. Pearson award. Following the Penguins' 
disappointing playoff exit, General Manager Ray Shero made sweeping changes 
to the team at the 2012 NHL Entry Draft for the upcoming 2012–13 season. 
After Jordan Staal rejected a ten-year contract offer to stay with the 
Penguins, he was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for a first-round 
draft pick (Derrick Pouliot), Brandon Sutter and Brian Dumoulin. The Penguins 
then traded defenseman Zbynek Michalek to the Phoenix Coyotes for a third-round 
draft pick, Marc Cheverie and prospect Harrison Ruopp. The Penguins also 
signed veteran goaltender Tomas Vokoun to a two-year contract after acquiring 
his negotiating rights for a seventh-round draft pick.[24][25][26] During 
the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, the Penguins again fought through 
serious injury. Malkin missed 17 games to a mild concussion and shoulder 
injury, while Crosby missed the entire month of April with a broken jaw. 
At the trade deadline, General Manager Ray Shero sold-off several prospects 
and draft picks to acquire Jarome Iginla, Brendan Morrow, Douglas Murray 
and Jussi Jokinen in separate deals. At the end of the regular season, 
the Penguins finished atop the Eastern Conference, matching-up against 
the eighth-seeded New York Islanders in round one. The Penguins defeated 
the Islanders in six games, with Marc-Andre Fleury struggling once again 
and being replaced by Tomas Vokoun after Game 4. The Penguins then dispatched 
the Ottawa Senators in five games before being swept in the Conference 
Finals by the Boston Bruins, scoring just two goals in the entire four-game 
sweep. On June 13, 2013, Malkin signed an eight-year contract extension 
worth an annual average of $9.5 million. This extension, along with Crosby's 
12-year extension previously signed in the 2012 off-season, ensured that 
the duo will likely remain the core of the Penguins for the foreseeable 
future. In the 2013–14 season, the Penguins acquired Marcel Goc and Lee 
Stempniak and again suffered through numerous injuries throughout the campaign, 
including the season-ending losses of Pascal Dupuis to a torn ACL in December 
and Kris Letang to a stroke suffered in January. Despite the adversity, 
the Penguins won the realigned, eight-team Metropolitan Division, though 
Pittsburgh struggled in the playoffs, requiring six games to defeat the 
Columbus Blue Jackets, then losing to the New York Rangers in seven games 
despite leading the series 3–1 after four games. The team's series collapse 
prompted Penguins ownership to fire General Manager Ray Shero, replacing 
him on June 6 with Jim Rutherford, the former general manager of the Carolina 
Hurricanes.[27] Rutherford's first action as GM was to relieve Head Coach 
Dan Bylsma of his duties, and on June 25, he announced that Mike Johnston 
was hired as Bylsma's replacement behind the bench. In the 2014–15 season, 
the Penguins led the Metropolitan Division for the first half of the season. 
However, after losing players such as Olli Maatta—shoulder surgery—and 
Pascal Dupuis—a blood clot in his lungs—to injuries and illnesses including 
the mumps, the team fell to fourth in the Division. The team also led the 
League in penalty minutes throughout the season. As a result, the Penguins 
were in danger of elimination from playoff contention with one game remaining 
in the regular season. In the final game, however, the Penguins clinched 
the eighth and final playoff spot with a win against Buffalo, which simultaneously 
eliminated Boston from playoff contention after the team's loss to Tampa 
Bay. Nonetheless, Pittsburgh would lose in five games to the New York Rangers 
in the first round of the playoffs. On July 1, 2015 the Penguins traded 
Nick Spaling, Kasperi Kapanen, Scott Harrington, a conditional first round 
pick, and a third round pick to the Toronto Maple Leafs for Phil Kessel, 
Tyler Biggs, Tim Erixon, and a second round pick. Toronto will also retain 
$1.2 million of Kessel’s salary in each of the next seven seasons.[28] 
On July 28, 2015, the Penguins acquired Nick Bonino, Adam Clendening and 
a 2nd round pick in 2016 for Brandon Sutter and a 3rd round pick.[29] On 
August 6, 2015, the Penguins signed certer Matt Cullen to a 1-year deal. 
The move reunited him with Jim Rutherford, whom had worked with Cullen 
during his time as general manager of the Carolina Hurricanes.[30] On October 
27, 2015 former Penguins' defenseman Sergei Gonchar accepted a player development 
coaching position within the Penguins organization, after failing to make 
the team at the conclusion of training camp.[31] On December 8, 2015 Pascal 
Dupuis announced his retirement in-season due to lingering health concerns 
related to blood clots. He was placed on long-term injured reserve but 
remains under contract with the Penguins.[32] On December 12, the team 
had a record of 15–10–3. The organization then fired head coach Mike Johnston 
and replaced him with Mike Sullivan, head coach of the organization's American 
Hockey League affiliate in Wilkes-Barre.[33] This move was followed by 
a series of trades by Jim Rutherford. On December 14, 2015, Rob Scuderi 
was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for Trevor Daley.[34] 
On January 16, 2016, the Penguins traded forward David Perron and defenceman 
Adam Clendening to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for Carl Hagelin.[35] 
on February 27, 2016 the Penguins acquired Justin Schultz was traded from 
the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for a third round pick in the 2016 NHL 
Entry Draft.[36] To supplement these trades, the Penguins called-up several 
players from their AHL affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, which 
included Conor Sheary, Tom Kuhnhackl, Bryan Rust and goaltender Matt Murray; 
who all would became regulars in the team's postseason lineup.[37] The 
Penguins qualified for the playoffs for the tenth consecutive season. They 
earned second place in the Metropolitan Division with 104 points. In the 
2016 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Penguins defeated the New York Rangers in 
a 4–1 series, the Washington Capitals 4–2, and the Tampa Bay Lightning 
4–3, to win the Eastern Conference Championship, advancing to the Stanley 
Cup Finals against the San Jose Sharks.[38] On June 12, 2016, the Penguins 
defeated the Sharks in a 4-2 series to win their fourth Stanley Cup title. 
Team captain Sidney Crosby was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.[39] The 
original Penguins logo, used 1967–68, Winter Classic 2011, Alternate Jersey 
2011–2013 Primary logo, used 1968–1971, Winter Classic 2008; Alternate 
Jersey 2008–2011 Primary logo, used 1971–1992, 2016–present, Primary logo, 
used 1992–2002 Alternate logo, used 2000–2007 (the primary logo 1992–2002, 
with a Vegas gold triangle as opposed to "Pittsburgh gold") Primary logo 
from 2002–2016 Team wordmark, used 2002–2016 With the exception of the 
1992–2002 period, the Penguins have used a variation of the "skating penguin" 
logo since the team's inception. For their inaugural season, the logo featured 
a hefty-looking skating penguin wearing a scarf, on a gold triangle inside 
a circle reading "Pittsburgh Penguins." The gold triangle is a reference 
to the Golden Triangle in the city of Pittsburgh. Then-General Manager 
Jack Riley felt the team's name and logo were ridiculous, and refused to 
have either appear on the team's uniforms, which featured only the word 
"PITTSBURGH" diagonally. A refined version of the logo appeared on a redesigned 
uniform in the second season, which removed the scarf and gave the penguin 
a sleeker, "meaner" look. The circle encompassing the logo was removed 
mid-season in 1971–72. The team's colors were originally powder blue, navy 
blue and white. The powder blue was changed to royal blue in 1973, but 
returned in 1977 when navy became the predominant uniform color. The team 
adopted the current black and gold color scheme in January 1980 (the announcement 
was made at halftime of Super Bowl XIV) to unify the colors of the city's 
professional sports teams, although like the Pittsburgh Pirates and Steelers, 
the shade of gold more closely resembled yellow. The change was not without 
controversy, as the Boston Bruins protested by claiming to own the rights 
to the black and gold colors. However the Penguins cited the colors worn 
by the now-defunct NHL team Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1920s, as well as 
black and gold being the official colors of the City of Pittsburgh and 
its namesake, thus were able to secure permission to use the black and 
gold colors. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates used old Pittsburgh Police uniforms, 
hence beginning the black and gold sports tradition in the city. This would 
remain unchanged until the 1992–93 season, when the team unveiled new uniforms 
and a new logo, made by Pittsburgh visual communications agency Vance Wright 
Adams. The logo featured a modern-looking, streamlined penguin.[40] Although 
the "Robo-Penguin" logo survived in various forms for 15 years, it received 
mixed responses from fans and was never as widely accepted as the "skating 
penguin" logo. Longtime KDKA anchor Bill Burns even went as far as calling 
the penguin in the logo "a pigeon." After Mario Lemieux (a personal fan 
of the "skating penguin" logo) purchased the team from bankruptcy court 
in 1999, he announced plans to bring back the "skating penguin" logo. This 
occurred for the 2000–01 season, when the team revived the logo (albeit 
with a "Vegas gold" triangle instead of "Pittsburgh gold") on the chest 
of the team's new alternate jersey. In 2002–03, the logo became the primary 
logo,[41] and the "flying penguin" logo (also with a "Vegas gold" triangle 
instead of "Pittsburgh gold") was relegated to secondary status and only 
on the shoulders of the team's jerseys, until it was retired in 2007 when 
the team introduced their version of the Rbk Edge uniforms.[40] The uniforms 
themselves have changed several times over the years. The original jerseys 
from the team's first season had diagonal text reading "Pittsburgh." Currently, 
only images of these uniforms survive, although the jersey is available 
in NHL Hitz 2003 and several EA Sports' NHL games as an alternate jersey 
available to play in for the team. The uniforms themselves were discovered 
nearly 30 years later in a garbage bag by a Civic Arena employee at the 
arena. Due to the years of neglect in the bag, the uniforms were damaged 
beyond repair. The following season, a revised version of the logo was 
used on a completely redesigned uniform. Player names were first added 
in 1970. Until 1977, the team had some minor striping patterns on the jerseys 
change every few years. But in 1977, the team basically adopted their longest-lasting 
uniform style to date and a style they would wear for the next 16 seasons, 
winning the Stanley Cup twice in the process. When the colors were swapped 
from blue and white to black and gold in 1980, the uniform patterns themselves 
remained unchanged. This was likely due to the fact that the change was 
made in the middle of the season. From the 1981–82 season to the 1984–85 
season, the team had a gold "Sunday" jersey, called as such because the 
team only worn them on Sundays. This was a rare example of an NHL team 
having a third jersey before the rule allowing such jerseys was officially 
implemented in 1995. After winning their second Stanley Cup in 1992, the 
team completely redesigned their uniforms and introduced the "flying penguin" 
logo. The team's away uniforms were somewhat of a throwback to the team's 
first season, as they revived the diagonal "Pittsburgh" script. In 1995, 
the team introduced their second alternate jersey, featuring different 
stripe designs on each sleeve. This jersey would prove to be so popular 
that the team adopted it as their away jersey in 1997. In 2000, the team 
unveiled yet another alternate jersey, the aforementioned black jersey 
featuring the revival of the "skating penguin" logo. This would later prove 
to be a test to see how the revived logo would do with fans, and the following 
season became the team's away uniform with a white version as the team's 
home jersey. This time, the gold used is known as "Vegas gold," a more 
metallic shade. When the Rbk Edge jerseys were unveiled for the 2007–08 
season leaguewide, the Penguins made major striping pattern changes and 
quietly removed the "flying penguin" logo from the shoulders. They also 
added a "Pittsburgh 250" gold circular patch to the shoulders to commemorate 
the 250th birthday of the city of Pittsburgh. While the Penguins, as with 
the rest of the NHL, have worn their black jersey at home since the league 
made the initiative to do so starting with the 2003–04 NHL season, the 
team wore their white jerseys in some home games during the 2007–08 season 
and at least once during the 2008–09 season, as well as wearing their powder 
blue, 1968–1972 "throwbacks" against the Buffalo Sabres in the 2008 NHL 
Winter Classic. On November 5, 2008, this jersey was introduced as the 
team's current third jersey. This was worn for select home games during 
the 2008–09, 2009–10 and 2010–11 seasons. This throwback was supposedly 
to be retired with the introduction of a new dark blue third jersey that 
made its debut at the 2011 NHL Winter Classic at Heinz Field,[42] but it 
has been worn at several games since the Winter Classic. The new 2011 Winter 
Classic jersey was first worn as the third jersey against the Los Angeles 
Kings on February 10, 2011. After this, the Penguins discontinued the usage 
of their 2008 Winter Classic jerseys. For the 2011–12 season, the 2011 
Winter Classic jersey was the team's official third uniform, with the 2008 
Winter Classic uniform being retired.[43] Called the "Blue Jerseys of Doom" 
by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the alternate jerseys were worn when 
Sidney Crosby sustained a broken jaw injury on March 30, 2013, and also 
when he received a concussion in the 2011 Winter Classic. Center Evgeni 
Malkin was also injured, also with a concussion, during a game when the 
Penguins donned the alternate uniforms on February 22, 2013. The team was 
set to wear the blue jerseys for an April 2, 2013, game against the Buffalo 
Sabres, three days after Crosby sustained a broken jaw wearing one, but 
instead wore their black and "Vegas gold" home jerseys.[44] On April 4, 
2013, the Penguins announced that the club would not wear an alternate 
uniform for the 2013–14 season. The team then announced that they were 
in the process of working up a new design for possibly the 2014–15 season, 
the 30th anniversary of majority co-owner Mario Lemieux's rookie season.[45] 
The Penguins wore a modified version of their away uniforms for the 2014 
NHL Stadium Series against the Chicago Blackhawks at Soldier Field, featuring 
enlarged numbers at the back, slightly angled stripes and sleeve numbers 
and a chrome-treated version of the "skating penguin" in front. On September 
19, 2014, the Penguins released their new alternate uniforms for the 2014–15 
season. The new black uniforms are throwbacks to the early part of Lemieux's 
playing career, emulating the uniforms worn by the Penguins' 1991 and 1992 
Stanley Cup-winning teams. The new alternate uniform features "Pittsburgh 
gold," the particular shade of gold which had been retired when the Penguins 
switched to the metallic gold full-time in 2002. After the 2016 season, 
the team returned to using the "Pittsburgh gold" jerseys as the primary 
uniforms. The "Vegas gold" jerseys were retired, in time for the 50th anniversary 
in 2017. The new home and away "Pittsburgh gold" jerseys were unveiled 
on June 24, 2016, to be first presented at the 2016 NHL Entry Draft. This

Team All-Star Second Team All-Star Season Playoffs The Philadelphia Flyers–Pittsburgh 
Penguins rivalry began in 1967 when the teams were introduced into the 
NHL's "Next Six" expansion wave. The rivalry exists both due to divisional 
alignment and geographic location, as both teams play in the State of Pennsylvania. 
The Flyers lead the head-to-head record with a 142–91–30 record.[72] However, 
the Penguins eliminated the Flyers from the playoffs in 2008 and 2009 and 
were eliminated from the playoffs in 2012 by the Flyers, strengthening 
the rivalry.[73] In total, the franchises have met six times in the playoffs, 
with the Flyers winning four series (1989 Patrick Division Finals, 4–3; 
1997 Eastern Conference Quarter-finals, 4–1; 2000 Eastern Conference Semifinals, 
4–2; and 2012 Eastern Conference Quarter-finals, 4–2) and the Penguins 
winning two (2008 Eastern Conference Finals, 4–1; and 2009 Eastern Conference 
Quarterfinals, 4–2). The two teams have faced-off nine times in the playoffs, 
with the Penguins winning eight of the nine matchups, their only series 
loss coming in the 1994 playoffs. The Penguins defeated the Capitals en 
route to all four of their Stanley Cup victories. They have met in a decisive, 
series-deciding Game 7 in the 1992, 1995 and 2009 playoffs. This rivalry 
was showcased at the NHL's fourth Winter Classic, played January 1, 2011, 
at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh. The Capitals won the game 3–1. The rivalry 
can also be seen in the American Hockey League (AHL). Pittsburgh's top 
farm team is the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and their in-state and 
biggest rivals are the Capitals' top farm team, the Hershey Bears. Ever 
since their inception, the Columbus Blue Jackets had never established 
a consistent rivalry with any other team. That changed starting from the 
2013-14 season, when they were placed in the same division as Pittsburgh.[74] 
The 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs furthered the rivalry as Columbus won their 
first ever playoff game on April 19, 2014 against Pittsburgh. Despite Pittsburgh's 
long history with hockey and having a small, but loyal fanbase early on, 
the Penguins struggled with fan support early on in its history, at times 
only averaging 6,000 fans per game when Civic Arena had a seating capacity 
over 16,000. Fan support was so low by the team's first bankruptcy that 
the NHL had no problems with the team being moved, something that would 
change decades later when the team faced another relocation threat. While 
the drafting of Mario Lemieux began piquing interest in hockey locally, 
fan support was still skeptical. John Steigerwald, brother of current Penguins 
broadcaster Paul Steigerwald, once noted in his autobiography that upon 
his arrival at KDKA-TV from WTAE-TV in 1985 that the station cared more 
about the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League than the 
Penguins.[75] However, Lemieux's play steadily grew the fanbase in the 
area, which would only be reassured upon the arrival of Sidney Crosby after 
the team struggled both on the ice and in attendance following the Jaromir 
Jagr trade. Today, the Penguins are one of the NHL's most popular teams, 
especially among American non-Original Six franchises and are considered 
second behind the Steelers among Pittsburgh's three major professional 
sports teams, taking advantage of both its success and the Pittsburgh Pirates 
struggles both on and off the field.[76] Especially notable was a 2007 
survey done of the four major sports leagues 122 teams, in which the Penguins 
surprised observers by being ranked 20th overall and third among NHL teams, 
while the Steelers were ranked number one and the Pirates (before the arrival 
of Andrew McCutchen and that team's turnaround)[77] ranking much lower 
on the list from its peers. The Penguins popularity has at times even rivaled 
that of the Steelers at the local level.[78] The Penguins called Civic 
Arena home for over 45 seasons, beginning with their inception in 1967. 
In September 2010, they completed the move to the state-of-the-art Consol 
Energy Center (now named PPG Paints Arena). The Penguins also played two 
"home" games in the Cleveland suburb of Richfield, Ohio, in 1992 and 1993 
at the Richfield Coliseum (this is not unlike the Cleveland Cavaliers of 
the NBA playing an annual pre-season game in Pittsburgh;[79] the Philadelphia 
76ers also used the Civic Arena as a second home in the early 1970s).[80] 
From 1995 to 2015 the IceoPlex at Southpointe in the South Hills suburbs 
served as the team's practice facility. Robert Morris University's 84 Lumber 
Arena has at times served as a secondary practice facility for the team. 
During the franchise's first pre-season training camp and pre-season exhibition 
games, the Brantford Civic Centre in Brantford, Ontario, served as its 
home,[81] and by the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, the team was 
using the suburban Rostraver Ice Garden for training. In August 2015 the 
Penguins and the UPMC opened UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, combining a new 
team practice and training facility with a UPMC Sports Medicine treatment 
and research complex, in suburban Cranberry Township near the interchange 
between Interstate 79 and Pennsylvania Route 228.[82] The twin rink facility 
replaced both the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the 
Penguins' regular practice facility, freeing up the Consol Energy Center 
for other events on days the Penguins are not scheduled to play.[83] As 
with most other NHL arenas, the Penguins make use of a goal horn whenever 
the team scores a goal at home. It is also played just before the beginning 
of a home game, and after a Penguins victory. Their current goal horn, 
made by Nathan Manufacturing, Inc. and introduced in 2005 to coincide with 
the arrival of Sidney Crosby to the team, was used at both the Civic Arena 
and the Consol Energy Center.[84][85] The Penguins have two minor league 
affiliates assigned to their team. The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, 
their AHL affiliate, have played in Wilkes-Barre Township, Pennsylvania, 
since 1999. The Penguins also have a secondary affiliate in the ECHL, the 
Wheeling Nailers, which they have been associated with since the start 
of the 2000–01 season.[86] The Penguins currently have their radio home 
on WXDX-FM and their television home on Root Sports Pittsburgh. The Penguins 
have recently started their own 24-hour radio channel on HD Radio, with 
WXDX converting their adult album alternative digital subchannel on HD-2 
into a 24-hour Penguins channel. The channel will feature the NHL's own 
daily NHL Live and NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman's weekly NHL Hour, in 
addition to local programming. The team becomes the first NHL team with 
its own radio channel, and joins the National Football League's Dallas 
Cowboys as the second professional sports team to have such a channel.[87] 
In November 2009, the Penguins also launched a weekly radio show, NHL Na 
Russkom (NHL in Russian), hosted by George Birman and Oleg Mejeritski of 
Sovetsky Sport in order to appeal to Russian-speaking fans of the team.[88] 
The Penguins were broadcast by local ABC affiliate WTAE-TV during the 1967–68 
season, with station Sports Director Ed Conway[89] handling the play-by-play 
during both the television and radio broadcasts[90] and would remain as 
the lone play-by-play broadcaster until the completion of the 1968–69 season. 
Joe Tucker took over for Ed Conway during the 1969–70 season, when WPGH-TV 
and WTAE-TV split Penguins' broadcasts. WPGH-TV retained the rights to 
broadcast the Penguins for the 1970–71 season with Bill Hamilton handing 
the play-by-play duties. The 1970–71 season was also the first season where 
the Penguins introduced a color commentator to the broadcast team, with 
John MacDonald taking the position as the booth's color commentator. The 
broadcasting rights to the Penguins were then transferred to WIIC-TV 11 
in 1971, with Sam Nover handling the play-by-play with several color commentators 
interchanged during his tenure. Nover eventually left WIIC to join NBC 
Sports as a play-by-play broadcaster for the National Football League. 
During the Penguins' time with WIIC, the station broadcast "about a dozen" 
Penguins game each season.[91] Penguins' games returned to WPGH-TV for 
the 1977–78 season with former long-time Pittsburgh Pirates broadcaster 
Bob Prince handling the play-by-play. Prince was criticized by fans for 
not being knowledgeable towards the game[91] and that his style was better 
suited for baseball than hockey. He was later removed from the broadcast 
team and reassigned as an intermission interviewer. In his place was Jim 
Forney, who had previously held the position of color commentator during 
Sam Novak's tenure. Mike Lange, who joined the Penguins' broadcast team 
as a play-by-play announcer on the radio side in 1974–75, became the play-by-play 
broadcaster for the team at the start of the 1979–80 season. At his side 
was Terry Schiffauer, who had previously held the position of Penguins' 
director of public relations and eventually transitioned into color commentator 
for Sam Nover since 1972–73. Lange and Schiffauer remained a team in the 
Penguins' broadcast booth until 1984–85, when Schiffauer was replaced by 
Paul Steigerwald. While the Penguins broadcast network transitioned from 
WPGH-TV (1979–90) to KDKA-TV (1990–96), along with the eventual transition 
to KBL (later Prime Sports) and eventually Fox Sports Pittsburgh 1996–2011), 
the team of Lange and Steigerwald remained a constant in the broadcast 
booth from 1985 until 1999. During this time, local stations WPGH and WPTT-TV 
also carried a handful of games that were not available on Fox Sports Pittsburgh 
during the 1996–97 season. Also notable during the 1996-97 NHL season is 
that former broadcaster Sam Nover returned to the team in a new role; this 
time as a post-game studio host, sharing duties with John Fedko and Thor 
Tolo. With Steigerwald's departure in 1999, Mike Lange shared the broadcast 
booth with former Penguins' defenseman Peter Taglianetti. Taglianetti, 
a two-time Stanley Cup winner with the team in 1991 and 1992, remained 
in the position for one season before being replaced by Ed Olczyk. Lange 
and Olczyk were broadcast partners from 2000 until 2003, when Olczyk left 
the booth to become the 18th head coach in Penguins history that had become 
upon due to the firing of previous Head Coach Rick Kehoe after the 2002–03 
season.[92] With Olczyk's vacancy, the Penguins hired Bob Errey as their 
new color commentator for the start of the 2003–04 season (a position that 
he continues to hold as of the start of the 2012–13 season. Lange and Errey 
remained in the booth until 2005–06. After 26 seasons in the television 
broadcast booth, Mike Lange was not retained by FSN Pittsburgh. Instead, 
he was replaced by former broadcast partner Paul Steigerwald, who remains 
the current play-by-play broadcaster for the team as of the 2012–13 season. 
Lange returned to the radio broadcast booth and currently holds the position 
of radio play-by-play announcer, the same position he had held with the 
team in the mid-1970s. Every Penguins game is currently carried on the 
Root Sports Pittsburgh network, which is carried by cable providers in 
most of two states and parts of four others: All of Pennsylvania (save 
the ten county Philadelphia metro area), all of West Virginia except the 
two counties in the Washington, D.C., metro area, eight counties in eastern 
and southern Ohio, three counties in Western Maryland, one county in Southwestern 
New York state and one county in Northeastern Kentucky. In addition, Fox 
Sports Ohio simulcasts Penguins hockey in the Cleveland metro area, as 
well as some parts of Eastern Ohio and Northern Kentucky. Dish Network, 
Verizon FiOS and Direct TV all carry the Penguins games on their Root Sports 
Pittsburgh channel in HD nationally. The TV announcers are: The Pittsburgh 
Penguins also receive monthly and sometimes weekly "game of the week" national 
exposure on both NBC Sports Network and NBC along with TSN and CBC Sports 
in Canada. Prior to 2004, Penguins games have been aired on ESPN and ESPN2. 
The Pittsburgh Penguins Radio Network consists of a total of 34 stations 
in four states.[93] Twenty three of these are in Pennsylvania, four in
