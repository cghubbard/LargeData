Nickname(s): "The Garden City", "City of Newly Weds and Nearly Deads"[1] 
80,032 Victoria /vɪkˈtɔːriə/ (Saanich: Mətúliyə[6]) is the capital city 
of British Columbia, Canada, and is located on the southern tip of Vancouver 
Island off Canada's Pacific coast. The city has a population of about 80,017, 
while the metropolitan area of Greater Victoria, has a population of 344,615, 
making it the 15th most populous Canadian urban region. Victoria is the 
southernmost major city in Western Canada, and is located about 100 kilometres 
(60 miles) from BC's largest city of Vancouver on the mainland. The city 
is about 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Seattle by airplane, ferry, or 
the Victoria Clipper passenger-only ferry which operates daily, year round 
between Seattle and Victoria and 40 kilometres (25 miles) from Port Angeles, 
Washington, by ferry Coho across the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Named after 
Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and, at the time, British North America, 
Victoria is one of the oldest cities in the Pacific Northwest, with British 
settlement beginning in 1843. The city has retained a large number of its 
historic buildings, in particular its two most famous landmarks, Legislative 
buildings (finished in 1897 and home of the Legislative Assembly of British 
Columbia) and the Empress hotel (opened in 1908). The city's Chinatown 
is the second oldest in North America after San Francisco's. The region's 
Coast Salish First Nations peoples established communities in the area 
long before non-native settlement, possibly several thousand years earlier, 
which had large populations at the time of European exploration. Victoria, 
like many Vancouver Island communities, continues to have a sizeable First 
Nations presence, composed of peoples from all over Vancouver Island and 
beyond. Known as the "The Garden City", Victoria is an attractive city 
and a popular tourism destination with a thriving technology sector that 
has risen to be its largest revenue-generating private industry.[7] Victoria 
is in the top twenty of world cities for quality-of-life,[8] according 
to Numbeo. The city has a large non-local student population, who come 
to attend the University of Victoria, Camosun College, Royal Roads University, 
the Victoria College of Art, the Sooke Schools International Programme 
and the Canadian College of Performing Arts. Victoria is very popular with 
boaters with its beautiful and rugged shorelines and beaches. Victoria 
is also popular with retirees, who come to enjoy the temperate and usually 
snow-free climate of the area as well as the usually relaxed pace of the 
city. Prior to the arrival of European navigators in the late 1700s, the 
Victoria area was home to several communities of Coast Salish peoples, 
including the Songhees. The Spanish and British took up the exploration 
of the northwest coast, beginning with the visits of Juan Pérez in 1774 
and of James Cook. In 1778, although the Victoria area of the Strait of 
Juan de Fuca was not penetrated until 1790, Spanish sailors visited Esquimalt 
Harbour (just west of Victoria proper) in 1790, 1791, and 1792. In 1841 
James Douglas was charged with the duty of setting up a trading post on 
the southern tip of Vancouver Island, upon the recommendation by George 
Simpson that a new more northerly post be built in case Fort Vancouver 
fell into American hands (see Oregon boundary dispute). Douglas founded 
Fort Victoria, on the site of present-day Victoria, British Columbia in 
anticipation of the outcome of the Oregon Treaty in 1846, extending the 
British North America/United States border along the 49th parallel from 
the Rockies to the Strait of Georgia.[citation needed] Erected in 1843 
as a Hudson's Bay Company trading post on a site originally called Camosun 
(the native word was "camosack", meaning "rush of water")[citation needed] 
known briefly as "Fort Albert", the settlement was renamed Fort Victoria 
in November 1843, in honour of Queen Victoria.[9][10] The Songhees established 
a village across the harbour from the fort. The Songhees' village was later 
moved north of Esquimalt. When the crown colony was established in 1849, 
a town was laid out on the site and made the capital of the colony. The 
superintendent of the fort, Chief Factor James Douglas was made the second 
governor of the Vancouver Island Colony (Richard Blanshard was first governor, 
Arthur Edward Kennedy was third and last governor), and would be the leading 
figure in the early development of the city until his retirement in 1864. 
When news of the discovery of gold on the British Columbia mainland reached 
San Francisco in 1858, Victoria became the port, supply base, and outfitting 
centre for miners on their way to the Fraser Canyon gold fields, mushrooming 
from a population of 300 to over 5000 within a few days. Victoria was incorporated 
as a city in 1862.[12] In 1865, Esquimalt was made the North Pacific home 
of the Royal Navy, and remains Canada's west coast naval base. In 1866 
when the island was politically united with the mainland, Victoria was 
designated the capital of the new united colony instead of New Westminster 
– an unpopular move on the Mainland – and became the provincial capital 
when British Columbia joined the Canadian Confederation in 1871. In the 
latter half of the 19th century, the Port of Victoria became one of North 
America's largest importers of opium, serving the opium trade from Hong 
Kong and distribution into North America. Opium trade was legal and unregulated 
until 1865, then the legislature issued licences and levied duties on its 
import and sale. The opium trade was banned in 1908. In 1886, with the 
completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway terminus on Burrard Inlet, Victoria's 
position as the commercial centre of British Columbia was irrevocably lost 
to the City of Vancouver. The city subsequently began cultivating an image 
of genteel civility within its natural setting, aided by the impressions 
of visitors such as Rudyard Kipling, the opening of the popular Butchart 
Gardens in 1904 and the construction of the Empress Hotel by the Canadian 
Pacific Railway in 1908. Robert Dunsmuir, a leading industrialist whose 
interests included coal mines and a railway on Vancouver Island, constructed 
Craigdarroch Castle in the Rockland area, near the official residence of 
the province's lieutenant-governor. His son James Dunsmuir became premier 
and subsequently lieutenant-governor of the province and built his own 
grand residence at Hatley Park (used for several decades as Royal Roads 
Military College, now civilian Royal Roads University) in the present City 
of Colwood. [13] A real-estate and development boom ended just before World 
War I, leaving Victoria with a large stock of Edwardian public, commercial 
and residential buildings that have greatly contributed to the city's character. 
With the economic crash and a surplus of single men, Victoria became a 
target-rich environment for recruiting. Two militia infantry battalions, 
the 88th Victoria Fusiliers and the 50th Gordon Highlanders, formed in 
the immediate pre-war period. Victoria was the home of Sir Arthur Currie. 
He had been a high-school teacher and real-estate agent prior to the war 
and was the Commanding Officer of the Gordon Highlanders in the summer 
of 1914. Before the end of the war he would command the Canadian Corps.[14] 
A number of municipalities surrounding Victoria were incorporated during 
this period, including the Township of Esquimalt, the District of Oak Bay, 
and several municipalities on the Saanich Peninsula. Since World War II 
the Victoria area has seen relatively steady growth, becoming home to two 
major universities. Since the 1980s the western suburbs have been incorporated 
as new municipalities, such as Colwood and Langford, which are known collectively 
as the Western Communities. Greater Victoria periodically experiences calls 
for the amalgamation of the thirteen municipal governments within the Capital 
Regional District.[15] The opponents of amalgamation state that separate 
governance affords residents a greater deal of local autonomy.[citation 
needed] The proponents of amalgamation argue that it would reduce duplication 
of services, while allowing for more efficient use of resources and the 
ability to better handle broad, regional issues and long-term planning.[citation 
needed] The landscape of Victoria was formed by water in various forms. 
Pleistocene glaciation put the area under a thick ice cover, the weight 
of which depressed the land below present sea level. These glaciers also 
deposited stony sandy loam till. As they retreated, their melt water left 
thick deposits of sand and gravel. Marine clay settled on what would later 
become dry land. Post-glacial rebound exposed the present-day terrain to 
air, raising beach and mud deposits well above sea level. The resulting 
soils are highly variable in texture, and abrupt textural changes are common. 
In general, clays are most likely to be encountered in the northern part 
of town and in depressions. The southern part has coarse-textured subsoils 
and loamy topsoils. Sandy loams and loamy sands are common in the eastern 
part adjoining Oak Bay. Victoria's soils are relatively unleached and less 
acidic than soils elsewhere on the British Columbia Coast. Their thick 
dark topsoils denoted a high level of fertility which made them valuable 
for farming until urbanization. Victoria has a mild warm summer Mediterranean 
climate (Köppen Csb)[17] with mild, rainy winters and cool, dry and sunny 
summers.[18] Other climate classification systems, such as Trewartha, place 
it in the Oceanic zone (Do).[19] At the Victoria Gonzales weather station, 
daily temperatures rise above 30 °C (86 °F) on average less than one day 
per year and fall below 0 °C (32 °F) on average only ten nights per year. 
Victoria has recorded completely freeze-free winter seasons four times 
(in 1925/26, 1939/40, 1999/2000, and 2002/03). 1999 is the only calendar 
year on record without a single occurrence of frost. During this time the 
city went 718 days without freezing, starting on 23 December 1998 and ending 
10 December 2000. The second longest frost-free period was a 686-day stretch 
covering 1925 and 1926, marking the first and last time the city has gone 
the entire season without dropping below 1 °C (34 °F).[20] During the winter, 
the average daily high and low temperatures are 8 and 4 °C (46.4 and 39.2 °F), 
respectively. The summer months are also relatively mild, with an average 
high temperature of 20 °C (68 °F) and low of 11 °C (51.8 °F), although 
inland areas often experience warmer daytime highs. The highest temperature 
ever recorded at Victoria Gonzales was 36.0 °C (96.8 °F) on 11 July 2007,[21] 
however the University of Victoria reached 37.6 °C (99.7 °F) on 29 July 
2009.[22] The coldest temperature on record is −18.9 °C (−2 °F) on 31 January 
1893.[23] The average annual temperature varies from a high of 11.4 °C 
(52.5 °F) that was set in 2004 to a low of 8.6 °C (47.5 °F) set in 1916.[20] 
Due to the rain shadow effect of the nearby Olympic Mountains, Victoria 
is the driest location on the British Columbia coast and one of the driest 
in the region. Average precipitation amounts in the Greater Victoria area 
range from 608 mm (23.9 in) at the Gonzales observatory in the City of 
Victoria to 1,124 mm (44.3 in) in nearby Langford.[24] The Victoria Airport, 
25 km (16 mi) north of the city, receives about 45% more precipitation 
than the city proper. Regional average precipitation amounts range from 
as low as 406 mm (16.0 in) on the north shore of the Olympic Peninsula[25] 
to 3,505 mm (138.0 in) in Port Renfrew located just 80 km (50 mi) away 
on the more exposed southwest coast of Vancouver Island. Vancouver measures 
1,589 mm (63 in) annually and Seattle is at 952 mm (37.5 in). One feature 
of Victoria's climate is that it has distinct dry and rainy seasons. Nearly 
two-thirds of the annual precipitation falls during the four wettest months, 
November to February. Precipitation in December, the wettest month (109 mm 
or 4.3 in) is nearly eight times as high as in July, the driest month (14 mm 
or 0.55 in). Victoria experiences the driest summers in Canada (outside 
of the extreme northern reaches of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut).[26] 
Victoria averages just 26 cm (10.2 in) of snow annually, about half that 
of Vancouver. Roughly one third of winters see virtually no snow, with 
less than 5 cm (1.97 in) falling during the entire season. When snow does 
fall, it rarely lasts long on the ground. Victoria averages just two or 
three days per year with at least 5 cm (1.97 in) of snow on the ground. 
Every few decades Victoria receives very large snowfalls, including the 
record breaking 100 cm (39.4 in) of snow that fell in December 1996. That 
amount places Victoria 3rd for biggest snowfall among major cities in Canada. 
With 2,193 hours of bright sunshine annually during the last available 
measurement period, Victoria was the second sunniest city in British Columbia 
after Cranbrook. In July 2013, Victoria received 432.8 hours of bright 
sunshine, which is the most sunshine ever recorded in any month in British 
Columbia history.[27] Victoria's equable climate has also added to its 
reputation as the "City of Gardens". The city takes pride in the many flowers 
that bloom during the winter and early spring, including crocuses, daffodils, 
early-blooming rhododendrons, cherry and plum trees. Every February there 
is an annual "flower count" in what for the rest of the country and most 
of the province is still the dead of winter. Due to its mild climate, Victoria 
and its surrounding area (southeastern Vancouver Island, Gulf Islands, 
and parts of the Lower Mainland and Sunshine Coast) are also home to many 
rare, native plants found nowhere else in Canada, including Quercus garryana 
(Garry oak), Arctostaphylos columbiana (Hairy manzanita), and Canada's 
only broad-leaf evergreen tree, Arbutus menziesii (Pacific madrone). Many 
of these species exist here, at the northern end of their range, and are 
found as far south as southern California and parts of Mexico. Non-native 
plants grown in Victoria include the cold-hardy palm Trachycarpus fortunei, 
which can be found in gardens and public areas of Victoria. One of these 
Trachycarpus palms stands in front of City Hall.[32] The following is a 
list of neighbourhoods in the City of Victoria, as defined by the city 
planning department.[33] For a list of neighbourhoods in other area municipalities, 
see Greater Victoria, or the individual entries for those municipalities. 
Informal neighbourhoods include: The population of Victoria was 80,017 
in 2011. The Victoria Census Metropolitan Area, comprising thirteen municipalities 
informally referred to as Greater Victoria, has a population of 344,615 
and is the largest urban area on Vancouver Island.[35] By population, Greater 
Victoria is the 15th largest metropolitan area in Canada. The Capital Regional 
District, which includes additional rural areas, has a total population 
of 345,164. Victoria is known for its disproportionately large retiree 
population. Some 6.4 percent of the population of Victoria and its surrounding 
area are more than 80 years of age—the highest proportion for any of Canada's 
metropolitan areas. The city also boasts the country's third-highest concentration 
of people 65 and older (17.8 per cent), behind only Peterborough, Ontario, 
and Kelowna, British Columbia.[36] Retirees throughout Canada are drawn 
to Victoria's mild climate, beautiful scenery, year-round golf season, 
and generally easy-going pace of life. A historically popular cliché referring 
to the city was that it is for "the newly wed and nearly dead".[37] Note: 
These categories are those used by Statistics Canada. The city's chief 
industries are technology, food products, tourism, education, federal and 
provincial government administration and services.[citation needed] Other 
nearby employers include the Canadian Forces (the Township of Esquimalt 
is the home of the Pacific headquarters of the Royal Canadian Navy), and 
the University of Victoria (located in the municipalities of Oak Bay and 
Saanich) and Camosun College (which have over 33,000 faculty, staff and 
students combined). Other sectors of the Greater Victoria area economy 
include: investment and banking, online book publishing, various public 
and private schools, food products manufacturing, light aircraft manufacturing, 
technology products, various high tech firms in pharmaceuticals and computers, 
engineering, architecture and telecommunications. Advanced technology is 
Victoria's largest revenue producing private industry with $3.15 billion 
in annual revenues generated by more than 880 tech companies that have 
over 15,000 direct employees.[43] The annual economic impact of the sector 
is estimated at more than $4.03 billion per year.[43] With three post secondary 
institutions, eight federal research labs, and Canada's Pacific Navy Base, 
Victoria has many of the elements required for a strong technology sector. 
Victoria has Canada's highest household internet usage and is ranked as 
"Canada's Smartest City" by Macleans Magazine.[44] Victoria is a major 
tourism destination with over 3.5 million overnight visitors per year who 
add more than a billion dollars to the local economy.[45] As well, an additional 
500,000 daytime visitors arrive via cruise ships which dock at Ogden Point 
near the city's Inner Harbour. Many whale watching tour companies operate 
from this harbour due to the whales often present near its coast. The city 
is also close to Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt, the Canadian Navy's primary 
Pacific Ocean naval base. Downtown Victoria also serves as Greater Victoria's 
regional downtown, where many night clubs, theatres, restaurants and pubs 
are clustered, and where many regional public events occur. Canada Day 
fireworks displays, Symphony Splash, and many other music festivals and 
cultural events draw tens of thousands of Greater Victorians and visitors 
to the downtown core. The Rifflandia and Electronic Music Festival are 
other music events that draw crowds to the downtown core. The city and 
metro region has hosted high-profile sports events including the 1994 Commonwealth 
Games, the 2009 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, the 2005 Ford World Men's 
Curling Championship tournament, and 2006 Skate Canada. Victoria co-hosted 
the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup at Royal Athletic Park, and is the venue for 
the Bastion Square Grand Prix Criterium road cycling race. The city is 
also a destination for conventions, meetings, and conferences, including 
a 2007 North Atlantic Treaty Organization military chief of staff meeting 
held at the Hotel Grand Pacific. Every year, the Swiftsure International 
Yacht Race attracts boaters from around the world to participate in the 
boat race in the waters off of Vancouver Island, and the Victoria Dragon 
Boat Festival brings over 90 teams from around North America. The Tall 
Ships Festival brings sailing ships to the city harbour. Victoria also 
hosts the start of the Vic-Maui Yacht Race, the longest offshore sailboat 
race on the West Coast.[citation needed] The Port of Victoria consists 
of three parts, the Outer Harbour, used by deep sea vessels, the Inner 
and Upper Harbours, used by coastal and industrial traffic. It is protected 
by a breakwater with a deep and wide opening. The port is a working harbour, 
tourist attraction and cruise destination. Esquimalt Harbour is also a 
well-protected harbour with a large graving dock and shipbuilding and repair 
facilities. In January 2005, a volunteer study by the Victoria Cool Aid 
Society found the homeless population to be approximately 700 individuals.[46] 
This was the first homeless count in the city. In 2006, a Times-Colonist 
news article estimated the homeless population to have increased by 30% 
in just a few weeks due to the anticipated tourism boom of the 2010 Winter 
Olympics in Vancouver.[47] In early 2008, an anti-homelessness programme 
based on a successful Italian programme was introduced to Victoria.[48] 
As of February 2013, no residents live there yet.[49] Despite Victoria's 
reputation as a tourist destination, pervasive homelessness and panhandling 
are serious problems in the downtown area, as is "open-air" drug use.[50][51][52][53][54] 
The homeless survey conducted by the Victoria Cool-Aid Society found 50% 
of the homeless population identify themselves as being of First Nations 
origin, and the majority of people living on the streets do not receive 
income assistance from the government.[46] Mayfair Shopping Centre is a 
mall located in Victoria, British Columbia. Mayfair, one of the first major 
shopping centres in Victoria, first opened as an outdoor strip mall on 
16 October 1963 with 27 stores.[55][59] It was built on the site of a former 
brickyard in the Maywood district, a then-semi-rural area in the northern 
part of Victoria.[59][60] Woodward's was Mayfair's original department 
store anchor upon the mall's opening.[59][61] Mayfair was enclosed and 
renovated into an indoor mall in 1974.[62][63] The mall underwent three 
later expansions in 1984 (with the addition of Consumers Distributing), 
1985 (expansion of the mall food court) and a major expansion in 1990 that 
saw the addition of more retail space.[62] The Bay (now Hudson's Bay) replaced 
Woodward's as Mayfair's department store anchor in 1993 following Hudson's 
Bay Company's acquisition of the Woodward's chain.[64] Mayfair now offers 
117 stores and services including Hudson's Bay and Toys "R" Us.[57] It 
has 454,213 square feet (42,197.8 m2) of retail space and it also provides 
customers with rooftop parking.[57] Tillicum Centre is a two-level shopping 
centre in Saanich that was built in 1982 and expanded thereafter.[65][66][67] 
It currently has over 50 shops and services.[67] Westshore Town Centre 
is an indoor and outdoor shopping centre in the Western Communities of 
Greater Victoria, the western municipalities. It has over 80 current stores 
including large retail corporate stores. [2]. The Uptown shopping centre 
is in Saanich Municipality of Greater Victoria. It contains large corporate 
retailers and smaller retailers, eateries, and other services on the main 
ground floor and the rooftop. It is the newest shopping center in Greater 
Victoria. The Victoria Symphony, led by Tania Miller, performs at the Royal 
Theatre and the Farquhar Auditorium of the University of Victoria from 
September to May. Every BC Day weekend, the Symphony mounts Symphony Splash, 
an outdoor event that includes a performance by the orchestra sitting on 
a barge in Victoria's Inner Harbour. Streets in the local area are closed, 
as each year approximately 40,000 people attend a variety of concerts and 
events throughout the day. The event culminates with the Symphony's evening 
concert, with Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture as the grand finale, complete 
with cannon fire from Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Gunners from HMCS QUADRA, 
a pealing carillon and a fireworks display to honour BC Day. Pacific Opera 
Victoria, Victoria Operatic Society, Victoria Philharmonic Choir, Canadian 
Pacific Ballet and Ballet Victoria stage two or three productions each 
year at the Macpherson or Royal Theatres. The annual multi-day Rifflandia 
Music Festival is one of Canada's largest modern, rock and pop music festivals. 
The Bastion Theatre, a professional dramatic company, functioned in Victoria 
through the 1970s and 1980s and performed high quality dramatic productions 
but ultimately declared bankruptcy in 1988. Reborn as The New Bastion Theatre 
in 1990 the company struggled for two more years before closing operations 
in 1992. The Belfry Theatre started in 1974 as the Springridge Cultural 
Centre in 1974. The venue was renamed the Belfry Theatre in 1976 as the 
company began producing its own shows. The Belfry's mandate is to produce 
contemporary plays with an emphasis on new Canadian plays. Other regional 
theatre venues include: Phoenix Theatre student theatre at the University 
of Victoria, Kaleidoscope Theatre and Intrepid Theatre, producers of the 
Victoria Fringe Theatre Festival and The Uno Festival of Solo Performance. 
The only Canadian Forces Primary Reserve brass/reed band on Vancouver Island 
is located in Victoria. The 5th (British Columbia) Field Regiment, Royal 
Canadian Artillery Band traces its roots back to 1864, making it the oldest, 
continually operational military band west of Thunder Bay, Ontario. Its 
mandate is to support the island's military community by performing at 
military dinners, parades and ceremonies, and other events. The band performs 
weekly in August at Fort Rodd Hill National Historic Site where the Regiment 
started manning the guns of the fort in 1896, and also performs every year 
at the Cameron Bandshell at Beacon Hill Park. The current major sporting 
and entertainment complex, for Victoria and Vancouver Island Region, is 
the Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre arena. It replaced the former Victoria 
Memorial Arena, which was constructed by efforts of World War II veterans 
as a monument to fallen comrades. World War I, World War II, Korean War, 
and other conflict veterans are also commemorated. Fallen Canadian soldiers 
in past, present, and future wars and/or United Nations, NATO missions 
are noted, or will be noted by the main lobby monument at the Save-On-Foods 
Memorial Centre. The arena was the home of the ECHL (formerly known as 
the East Coast Hockey League) team, Victoria Salmon Kings, owned by RG 
Properties Limited, a real estate development firm that built the Victoria 
Save On Foods Memorial Centre, and Prospera Place Arena in Kelowna. The 
arena is the home of the Victoria Royals Western Hockey League (WHL) team 
that replaced the Victoria Salmon Kings (ECHL). A number of well-known 
musicians and bands are from Victoria, including Nelly Furtado, David Foster, 
The Moffatts, Frog Eyes, Johnny Vallis, Jets Overhead, Bryce Soderberg, 
Swollen Members, Armchair Cynics, Nomeansno, The New Colors, Wolf Parade, 
The Racoons, Dayglo Abortions and Hot Hot Heat. Due to the proximity to 
Vancouver and a 6% distance location tax credit, Victoria is used as a 
filming location for many films, television series, and television movies. 
Some of these films include X2, X-Men: The Last Stand, In the Land of Women, 
White Chicks, Scary Movie, Final Destination, Excess Baggage and Bird on 
a Wire. Television series such as Smallville, The Dead Zone and Poltergeist: 
The Legacy were also filmed there. Canadian director Atom Egoyan was raised 
in Victoria. Actors Cameron Bright (Ultraviolet, X-Men: The Last Stand, 
Thank You for Smoking, New Moon) and Ryan Robbins (Stargate Atlantis, Battlestar 
Galactica, Sanctuary) were born in Victoria. Actor Cory Monteith from the 
television series Glee was raised in Victoria. Actor, artist, and athlete 
Duncan Regehr of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine was raised in the region. Nobel 
laureate Alice Munro lived in Victoria during the years when she published 
her first story collections and co-founded Munro's Books. Victoria resident 
Stanley Evans has written a series of mysteries featuring a Coast Salish 
character, Silas Seaweed, who works as an investigator with the Victoria 
Police Department. Other Victoria writers include Kit Pearson, Esi Edugyan, 
Robert Wiersema, W. D. Valgardson, Elizabeth Louisa Moresby, Madeline Sonik, 
Jack Hodgins, Dave Duncan, Bill Gaston, David Gurr, Ken Steacy, Sheryl 
McFarlane, Carol Shields and Patrick Lane. Gayleen Froese's 2005 novel 
Touch is set in Victoria. Beacon Hill Park is the central city's main urban 
green space. Its area of 75 hectares (190 acres) adjacent to Victoria's 
southern shore includes numerous playing fields, manicured gardens, exotic 
species of plants and animals such as wild peacocks, a petting zoo, and 
views of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Olympic Mountains in Washington 
across it. The sport of cricket has been played in Beacon Hill Park since 
the mid-19th century.[68] Each summer, the City of Victoria presents dozens 
of concerts at the Cameron Band Shell in Beacon Hill Park. [69] The extensive 
system of parks in Victoria also includes a few areas of natural Garry 
oak meadow habitat, an increasingly scarce ecosystem that once dominated 
the region. In the heart of downtown are the British Columbia Parliament 
Buildings, The Empress Hotel, Victoria Police Department Station Museum, 
the gothic Christ Church Cathedral, and the Royal British Columbia Museum/IMAX 
National Geographic Theatre, with large exhibits on local Aboriginal peoples, 
natural history, and modern history, along with travelling international 
exhibits. In addition, the heart of downtown also has the Emily Carr House, 
Victoria Bug Zoo, and Market Square. The oldest (and most intact) Chinatown 
in Canada is located within downtown. The Art Gallery of Greater Victoria 
is located close to downtown in the Rockland neighbourhood several city 
blocks from Craigdarroch Castle built by industrialist Robert Dunsmuir 
and Government House, the official residence of the Lieutenant-Governor 
of British Columbia. Numerous other buildings of historic importance or 
interest are also located in central Victoria, including: the 1845 St. 
Ann's Schoolhouse; the 1852 Helmcken House built for Victoria's first doctor; 
the 1863 Congregation Emanu-El, the oldest synagogue in continuous use 
in Canada; the 1865 Angela College built as Victoria's first Anglican Collegiate 
School for Girls, now housing retired nuns of the Sisters of St. Ann; the 
1871 St. Ann's Academy built as a Catholic school; the 1874 Church of Our 
Lord, built to house a breakaway congregation from the Anglican Christ 
Church cathedral; the 1890 St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church;[70] the 1890 
Metropolitan Methodist Church (now the Victoria Conservatory of Music), 
[71] which is publicly open for faculty, student, and guest performances, 
also acts as Camosun College Music Department; the 1892 St. Andrew's Cathedral; 
and the 1925 Crystal Gardens, originally a saltwater swimming pool, restored 
as a conservatory and most recently a tourist attraction called the B.C. 
Experience, which closed down in 2006. CFB Esquimalt navy base, in the 
adjacent municipality of Esquimalt, has a base museum dedicated to naval 
and military history, located in the Naden part of the base. [3] North 
of the city on the Saanich Peninsula are the marine biology Shaw Ocean 
Discovery Centre, Butchart Gardens, one of the biggest tourist and local 
resident attractions on Vancouver Island, as well as the Dominion Astrophysical 
Observatory, part of the National Research Council of Canada, Victoria 
Butterfly Gardens and Centre of the Universe planetarium.[72] Notable museums 
in Victoria include the Royal British Columbia Museum, the Maritime Museum 
of British Columbia and the British Columbia Aviation Museum located on 
the north edge of the Victoria International Airport. There are also numerous 
National Historic Sites in close proximity to Victoria, such as the Fisgard 
Lighthouse, Craigflower Manor and Schoolhouse, Hatley Castle and Hatley 
Park and Fort Rodd Hill, which is a coastal artillery fort built in the 
late 1890s, located west of the city in Colwood. Also located west of the 
city is Western Speedway, a 640-metre (4⁄10 mi) oval vehicular race track 
and the largest in Western Canada. Victoria has been home to many accomplished 
athletes in its history. Notable professional athletes include Steve Nash, 
twice Most Valuable Player in the National Basketball Association, who 
grew up in Victoria and played youth basketball at St. Michael's University 
School and Mount Douglas Secondary School. Furthermore, there are several 
current NHL hockey players from Greater Victoria, including brothers Jamie 
Benn and Jordie Benn of the Dallas Stars, Tyson Barrie of the Colorado 
Avalanche and Matt Irwin of the Nashville Predators. Michael Saunders, 
current outfielder for the Toronto Blue Jays was born in Victoria and still 
lives there during the off season. Professional racing cyclist and 2012 
Giro d'Italia winner, Ryder Hesjedal was born in Victoria and still calls 
the city home. Victoria has also been home to numerous Olympic Games athletes, 
including, but not limited to, multi-time medalists such as Silken Laumann, 
Ryan Cochrane, and Simon Whitfield. Victoria has also been a destination 
for numerous high-profile international sporting events. It hosted the 
1994 Commonwealth Games and the 2005 Ford World Men's Curling Championship. 
The 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup was co-hosted by Victoria along with five 
other Canadian cities; (Burnaby, Toronto, Edmonton, Ottawa, Montreal). 
Victoria was also the first city location of the cross Canada 2010 Winter 
Olympics torch relay that occurred before the start of the 2010 Winter 
Olympics. The city has also been home to numerous high-profile sports teams 
in its history. The Victoria Cougars are perhaps the most famous sports 
franchise the city has known, winning the Stanley Cup as members of the 
PCHA in 1925. Today a Junior 'B' team of that name plays in the Vancouver 
Island Junior Hockey League. From 1971 until 1994 there was also a team 
called the Victoria Cougars in the Western Hockey League, before they moved 
to Prince George to become the Prince George Cougars. The Victoria Salmon 
Kings played in the ECHL from 2004 to 2011. The Victoria Royals joined 
the WHL in 2011, also using the Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre as home. 
Victoria was also once home of the Victoria Athletics of the Western International 
League, a Class 'A' minor league baseball affiliate of the New York Yankees. 
The Greater Victoria area also serves as a headquarters for Rugby Canada, 
based out of Westhills Stadium in Langford, as well as a headquarters for 
Rowing Canada, based out of Victoria City Rowing Club at Elk Lake in Saanich. 
Aside from field or arena sports, Greater Victoria also has a rich motorsports 
history, and is home to a 4/10ths mile oval race track called Western Speedway. 
Opened in 1954, Western Speedway is the oldest speedway in western Canada, 
and features stock car racing, drag racing, demolition derbies and other 
events. Western Speedway is also home to the Victoria Auto Racing Hall 
of Fame and Museum. The Greater Victoria Sports Hall of Fame is located 
at the Save-on-Foods Memorial Centre, and features numerous displays and 
information on the sporting history of the city. Victoria's climate, location 
and variety of facilities make it ideal for many recreational activities 
including rock climbing, hiking, kayaking, golf, water sports, informal 
team sports and jogging. Victoria is also known as the Cycling Capital 
of Canada,[73] with hundreds of kilometres of bicycle paths, bike lanes 
and bike routes in the city, including the Galloping Goose Regional Trail. 
There are mountain biking trails at Mount Work Regional Park,[74] and Victoria 
is quickly becoming a bike tourism destination.[75] Cycling advocacy groups 
including Greater Victoria Cycling Coalition (GVCC) and the Bike To Work 
Society have worked to improve Victoria's cycling infrastructure and facilities, 
and to make cycling a viable transportation alternative, attracting 5% 
of commuters in 2005.[76] Bike to Work Week Victoria[77][78][79] is an 
annual event held in communities throughout greater Victoria, British Columbia. 
It is organized by the Greater Victoria Bike to Work Society. The purpose 
of the event is to encourage bicycle commuting. Bike to Work Week began 
in 1995. In 2008, the Bike to Work BC Society was formed as a legal entity 
to run the event in other communities around BC. Since its inception ridership 
in the yearly event has steadily increased, and in 2011 over 7000 people 
participated in Greater Victoria. Bike to Work Week is first a marketing 
initiative and secondarily a cycling event. The behavior change (public 
health) model, relying on research conducted by both the provincial and 
federal governments that identified barriers to cycling and reasons for 
choosing cycling, was applied as a way to accomplish the goal of recruiting 
employees to bicycle to work.[80] Bike to Work Week 2016 occurs on May 
30-June 5.[81] The Jordan River Diversion Dam is Vancouver Island's main 
hydroelectric power station. It was built in 1911.[82] The city's water 
is supplied by the Capital Regional District's Water Services Department 
from its Sooke Lake Reservoir. The lake is connected to a treatment plant 
at Japan Gulch by the 8.8 km (5.5 mi) Kapoor Tunnel. The lake water is 
very soft and requires no filtering. It is treated with chlorine, ammonia 
and ultraviolet light to control micro-organisms. [83] Until the tunnel 
was completed in 1967, water flowed from the lake through the circuitous, 
leaky and much smaller 44 km (27 mi) Sooke Flowline. The Hartland landfill 
is the waste disposal site for Greater Victoria area. Since 1985, it has 
been run by the Capital Regional District environmental services. It is 
located on top of a hill, between Victoria and Sidney, at the end of Hartland 
Avenue.48°32′17″N 123°27′48″W﻿ / ﻿48.538148°N 123.463368°W﻿ / 48.538148; 
-123.463368 There is a recycling centre, a sewer solid waste collection, 
hazardous waste collection, and an electricity generating station. This 
generating station now creates 1.6 megawatts of electricity, enough for 
1,600 homes.[84] The site has won international environmental awards.[85] 
The CRD conducts public tours of the facility. It is predicted to be full 
by 2045. Victoria discharges 81.7 megalitres (2,890,000 cubic feet)[86] 
per day of screened wastewater that has undergone preliminary treatment 
into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The wastewater treatment facilities at 
Clover Pt. and Macaulay Pt. serve seven municipalities composing the core 
area of the CRD. At these two facilities, wastewater is screened to exclude 
objects larger than 6 mm (0.24 in) then pumped through diffusers at the 
end of deep marine outfalls.[87] The CRD is currently planning an upgrade 
of its wastewater treatment infrastructure. The Saanich Peninsula wastewater 
treatment plant serves North Saanich, Central Saanich and the Town of Sidney 
as well as the Victoria International Airport, the Institute of Ocean Sciences 
and the Tseycum and Pauquachin First Nations communities. This is a secondary 
level treatment plant which produces Class A biosolids.[87] Local public 
transportation is run by the Victoria Regional Transit System, which is 
part of BC Transit. Since 2000, double decker buses have been introduced 
to the fleet and have become an icon for the city. Rider fare payments 
can be made in cash, monthly bus passes, disability yearly passes, or tickets. 
Passenger rail service to Victoria was provided by Via Rail, which operated 
the Victoria – Courtenay train north, along the eastern coast of Vancouver 
Island, to the cities of Nanaimo, Courtenay, and points between. There 
was one daily return trip, departing Victoria in the morning, and returning 
from Courtenay in the evening. Services along this line were suspended 
indefinitely on 19 March 2011, due to track replacement work.[88][89] Prior 
to further inspection of the track, service along the segment between Nanaimo 
and Victoria was originally planned to resume on 8 April, but lack of funding 
has prevented any of the work from taking place and it is unclear when 
or if the service will resume. The Victoria International Airport has non-stop 
flights to and from Toronto, San Francisco, Seattle and many cities throughout 
Western Canada. Multiple scheduled helicopter and seaplane flights are 
available daily from Victoria's Inner Harbour to Vancouver International 
Airport, Vancouver Harbour, and Seattle. The BC Ferries Swartz Bay Ferry 
Terminal, located 29 kilometres (18 mi) north of Victoria, has hourly sailings 
to Tsawwassen (a ferry terminal south of Vancouver) and to many of the 
Gulf Islands. The Washington State Ferry terminal in Sidney provides ferry 
service to Friday Harbor, Orcas Island, and ultimately Anacortes, Washington. 
In Victoria's Inner Harbour, an international ferry terminal provides car 
ferry service (M/V Coho)[90] to Port Angeles, Washington, high-speed catamaran 
service (Victoria Clipper) to Downtown Seattle, and seasonal passenger 
ferries to destinations in Washington including Friday Harbor, Port Angeles, 
and Bellingham. Victoria also serves as the western terminus (Mile Zero) 
for Canada's Trans-Canada Highway, the longest national highway in the 
world. The Mile Zero is located in the southern part of the city at the 
corner of Douglas Street and Dallas Road, where there is a small monument. 
Direct flights between Victoria and the San Francisco Bay Area (San Francisco, 
Oakland, Silicon Valley) began service on 5 June 2008.[91] Trips will be 
2 hours instead of the usual 6 hours because there will be no stop overs 
in Seattle, as with other flights. The service will be operated by United 
Airlines, using 66 seat Bombardier CRJ700 aircraft. The same newspaper 
article also mentions the Victoria Airport Authority's plans for further 
capacity expansions at the Victoria International Airport. These are expected 
to offer extended economic benefits to the region, especially the Tourism 
and High Tech industries. West Jet started a direct flight service to Las 
Vegas, Nevada, three times per week, on 9 September 2008 (Victoria Times 
Colonist, 29 May 2008). Bus service between Victoria and Vancouver is run 
by Pacific Coach Lines. The bus travels on the ferry. Average travel time 
between the two cities is 4 hours. Bus service from Victoria to points 
up island is run by Vancouver Island Coach Lines. Both bus services depart 
from the Victoria bus terminal located at 700 Douglas Street, behind the 
Fairmont Empress Hotel. Local roadways, although showing signs of increasing 
congestion due to increasing population, are relatively easy to travel 
via a variety of means. However, roads in Victoria are not based on a grid 
system as in Vancouver or Edmonton, and even most major streets do not 
follow a straight line from beginning to end as they wind around hills, 
parks, coastlines, and historic neighbourhoods, often changing names two 
or three times. There is little distinction between "streets" and "avenues" 
in Victoria as there is in other cities such as Vancouver or Edmonton where 
"streets" run north-south and "avenues" run east-west, and Victorians are 
unlikely to use the terms "north", "south", "east", or "west" when giving 
directions. The compact size of the city lends itself readily to smaller, 
fuel efficient alternatives to full size passenger cars, such as scooters, 
as areas with significantly steep hills, such as one would find in San 
Francisco, are very few. Victoria is also in the process of making the 
use of such methods of transportation more desirable (in a push towards 
a more "green", eco-friendly environment), by offering incentives to use 
such modes of transport, such as parking spaces in the downtown core specifically 
designed for vehicles "3 m (9 ft 10 in) or less" in wheelbase size, thus 
fostering the desirability for ownership of vehicles such as Smart Cars, 
motorcycles and small displacement scooters. Generally speaking, one can 
expect to reach most destinations within Greater Victoria within a time 
span of 20 – 30 minutes, perhaps approximately 60 minutes, dependent on 
traffic conditions, road construction or other reasons for blockage, where 
you are coming from, going to, and mode of transport. Travel time is longer 
during rush hour times due to large volume of traffic. Within the Greater 
Victoria area, private cars, SUVs, and light trucks together make up the 
majority of trips. However, the city boasts an excellent public transit 
system using a fleet of modern buses, and is beginning to plan for a rapid 
transit link to the western communities. Greater Victoria also has an expanding 
system designed to facilitate bicycles and electrically assisted bicycles 
via bike lanes on many main roads as well as the Galloping Goose Regional 
Trail and Lochside Regional Trail. These trails are designed exclusively 
for foot traffic and cyclists, and now pass through many communities, beginning 
at the downtown core and extending into areas such as Langford and Central 
and North Saanich. The city of Victoria lies entirely within the Greater 
Victoria School District. There is one public high school located within 
the city boundaries, Victoria High School, founded in 1876, making it the 
oldest High School in North America north of Portland, Oregon and west 
of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Most of the elementary schools in Victoria now offer 
the popular French immersion programmes in addition to programmes in English. 
The educational needs of the Francophone community in Victoria are served 
by École Victor-Brodeur in the adjacent municipality of Esquimalt. In addition, 
within the city proper there are several smaller schools serving segments 
of the community such as the Chinese School in Chinatown and Christ Church 
Cathedral School. The senior campus of Glenlyon-Norfolk School is located 
in the Oak Bay neighbourhood. The Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique, 
operates one Francophone school in the Victoria area: école Victor-Brodeur 
in Esquimalt. It is a M-12 primary and secondary school.[92] Victoria is 
served by three public post secondary educational institutions located 
outside the city in the Greater Victoria area: University of Victoria (UVic), 
Camosun College, and Royal Roads University (RRU). The University of Victoria 
is located on the Saanich, Oak Bay border. Camosun College has two campuses, 
both of which are located in Saanich. Royal Roads University is located 
in Colwood. Lester B. Pearson College of the Pacific is an international 
school, in Metchosin, a municipality to the west of Victoria. There are 
also several private vocational and English (ESL) training schools available 
for people who want to learn the English language or upgrade new job market 
skills. Sprott Shaw College is a private career training institution that 
has had a campus in Victoria since 1913. Victoria is the only Canadian 
provincial capital without a local CBC Television station, owned-and-operated 
or affiliate, although it does host a small CBC Radio station in the 700 
block of Kings Road. The region is considered to be a part of the Vancouver 
television market, receiving most stations that broadcast from across the 
Strait of Georgia, including the CBC, CTV, City and Global affiliates. 
The two television stations based in Victoria are CHEK-DT (an independent 
station) and CIVI-DT (a CTV Two affiliate). Victoria has four Sister Cities:[95]
