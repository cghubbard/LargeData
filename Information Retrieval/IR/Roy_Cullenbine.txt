Roy Joseph Cullenbine (October 18, 1913 – May 28, 1991) was a major league 
baseball outfielder and first baseman, playing for six teams in ten years: 
Detroit Tigers (1938–1939; 1945–1947), Brooklyn Dodgers (1940), St. Louis 
Browns (1940–1942), Washington Senators (1942), New York Yankees (1942) 
and Cleveland Indians (1943–1945). Cullenbine is particularly notable for 
his career-long ability to draw walks; he was among the American League 
leaders in walks for seven consecutive seasons from 1941 to 1947, and holds 
the major league record for most consecutive games (22) with a walk. Born 
in Nashville, Tennessee but raised in Detroit, Michigan, Cullenbine was 
a switch-hitter and one of the most prolific recipients of bases on balls 
in major league history. In his ten-year career, he collected almost as 
many walks (853) as he did hits (1,072). He was among the American League 
leaders in walks for seven consecutive seasons from 1941 to 1947. He was 
once walked four times in the same game by Yankee ace Lefty Gomez, in August 
1941. [1] In a July 1941 game, he scored 5 runs in only 2 official at bats. 
Driven largely by his ability to draw walks, he had a career on-base percentage 
of .408, 132 points higher than his career batting average of .276. This 
on-base percentage ranks 38th best in major league history, higher than 
many Hall of Fame legends, including Honus Wagner, Joe DiMaggio, Willie 
Mays and Hank Aaron. He played football for Detroit's Eastern High School, 
and was a Tiger batboy in 1930. In 1932, legendary scout Wish Egan saw 
him working out on Navin Field and signed him. His minor league career 
ran from 1932 to 1937, for Shreveport, Louisiana; Greenwood, Mississippi; 
Springfield, Illinois; Beaumont, Texas; and Toledo, Ohio.[1] After starting 
his major league career in 1938-39 for his home town Detroit Tigers, he 
was among several major league players declared free agents in January 
1940 by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis and was given a $25,000 bonus 
to sign with the Brooklyn Dodgers the following month. [2] After playing 
only 22 games for the Dodgers, he was traded in May 1940 to the St. Louis 
Browns for Joe Gallagher. He had a strong 1941 season for the Browns, hitting 
.317 with 121 walks for a .452 on-base percentage, 2nd only to Ted Williams 
in the AL. Cullenbine also drove in 98 runs, made the All-Star team (in 
Detroit, ending with a two-out ninth-inning come-from-behind walk-off three-run 
blast by Williams off Claude Passeau) and finished 10th in AL Most Valuable 
Player voting. After that career year with the Browns, he was bounced around 
to three different teams in 1942. He started the season with the Browns, 
but was traded to the Washington Senators on June 1. The New York Yankees 
then claimed him off waivers on August 31, 1942. This was a stroke of luck 
for Cullenbine, sending him to the 1942 World Series with a .300 on-base 
percentage and three runs scored for the Yanks, who were upset 4-1 by the 
overachieving St. Louis Cardinals. He was then traded on December 17, 1942 
to the Cleveland Indians, his fourth team that calendar year. He played 
for the Indians throughout 1943-44, putting up solid numbers both years: 
.289 & .284, with on-base percentages of .407 & .380. He made the All-Star 
team for a second time in 1944. Shortly after the start of the 1945 season, 
the Indians traded him back to his hometown Detroit Tigers where he had 
started his major league career. As was the case in 1942, he was fortunate 
enough to be traded in 1945 to a team that went on to win the American 
League pennant. In 1945, Cullenbine put up his best numbers in many offensive 
categories (with many stars still in World War II service). He led the 
American League with 113 walks, and was 2nd with a .402 on-base percentage. 
He also hit for power with 18 home runs (2nd), 93 RBIs (2nd), 51 extra 
base hits (4th) and a .444 slugging percentage (3rd). After leading the 
Tigers to the pennant, he helped the Tigers win the World Series over the 
Chicago Cubs. Despite hitting only .227 in the Series, he drew eight walks 
for a .433 on-base percentage and scored five runs. Cullenbine continued 
his solid offense for the Tigers in 1946 & 1947, with career-high .335 
batting average and .477 on-base percentage in 1946. In 1947, he hit a 
career-high 24 home runs and set a Tiger record with 137 walks, while his 
.407 on-base percentage was third best in the American League. From July 
2–22, 1947, he drew walks in 22 consecutive games, breaking Ted Williams' 
19 in 1941 (as the last .400 hitter at .406), a record still standing at 
the end of the 2012 season. [3] But with only 104 hits, his batting average 
dropped to .224 in 1947, and the Tigers released him after the season. 
Seeking to rebound from his release, he was picked up briefly by the Philadelphia 
Phillies only to be released again just three weeks into the 1948 season 
on April 19 without getting into a single game despite his high lifetime 
on-base percentage, a statistic not regarded anywhere near as highly in 
that era as it is today. He died of heart disease at 77 in 1991, and was 
buried at the Christian Memorial Cultural Center Cemetery in Rochester
