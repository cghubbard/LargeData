The Cincinnati Reds' 1984 season consisted of the Cincinnati Reds attempting 
to win the National League West. It marked the return of Bob Howsam as 
General Manager, after Dick Wagner was fired during the 1983 season. The 
Reds finished in fifth place that year, as they escaped last place in the 
NL West, which the team had finished in 1982 and 1983. Reds pitcher Mario 
Soto endured two suspensions during the 1984 season for various incidents. 
In the first incident, on May 27 against the Chicago Cubs in Wrigley Field, 
third baseman Ron Cey hit what was originally ruled a home run down the 
left field line. Believing the ball had gone foul, Soto and Reds manager 
Vern Rapp disputed the call, and during the argument, Soto shoved third 
base umpire Steve Rippley, who had made the call. After conferring, the 
umpires changed their decision and ruled it a foul ball, drawing a protest 
from the Cubs. However, for shoving Rippley, Soto was ejected, prompting 
him to charge the field and attack Cubs coach Don Zimmer, which triggered 
a ten-minute brawl. Four days later, National League president Chub Feeney 
suspended Mario Soto for five games. This game is also notable because 
Soto's opponent that day was future Hall of Fame Dennis Eckersley, who 
would go on to become a record-setting closer years later. "Eck", who was 
making his Cubs debut after being acquired in a trade with the Boston Red 
Sox, took the loss that day.[8] In the second incident, on June 16, the 
Reds were playing the Atlanta Braves in Atlanta. Soto threw several brushback 
pitches at Braves slugger Claudell Washington. Washington tossed his bat 
in the direction of Soto, appeared to go out to retrieve it, but instead 
walked toward the mound. Umpire Lanny Harris attempted to restrain Washington. 
Harris was thrown to the ground. Soto used the distraction to punch Washington. 
Several of Washington's teammates attempted to hold Washington to the ground. 
While they were doing that, Soto fired the baseball into the crowd of players, 
striking Braves coach Joe Pignatano. He was suspended three games for this 
incident; Washington received a five-game suspension for shoving Lanny 
Harris. The Reds drew the two smallest attendances in the history of Riverfront 
Stadium in 1984. Only 3,921 were on hand to see the Reds play the New York 
Mets on April 4, which was the record for the smallest crowd until May 
31, when they lost to the Braves 7-1 in a makeup game from April, which 
drew just 2,472. That started a five-game series sweep of the Reds by Atlanta. 
Prior to May 31, the Reds were 26-22 and trailed the San Diego Padres by 
a half-game in the NL West standings. From then until August 16, the Reds 
went 25-48 and had long left any hopes of winning the division. August 
16 was the day the Reds brought Rose back as player-manager, as part of 
a trade with Montreal, as Rapp was fired.[9] Infielders Coaches Note: Pos
