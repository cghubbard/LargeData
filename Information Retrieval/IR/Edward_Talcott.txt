Edward Baker Talcott (January 21, 1858 â€“ April 5, 1941) was a Major League 
Baseball executive. Talcott, a lawyer and stockbroker, financed the New 
York Giants franchise of the Players' League in 1890, along with Edwin 
McAlpin. When the League began to face financial difficulty following the 
1890 season, Talcott, McAlpin, and Brooklyn Ward's Wonders owner Wendell 
Goodwin agreed to merge their clubs with the National League counterparts 
in their own club's cities. Talcott then became a minority owner in the 
National League's New York Giants. He would sell his shares to Andrew Freedman
