William Lawrence "Larry" Gardner (May 13, 1886 – March 11, 1976) was a 
third baseman in Major League Baseball. From 1908 through 1924, Gardner 
played for the Boston Red Sox (1908–17), Philadelphia Athletics, and Cleveland 
Indians (1919–24). Gardner was born in Enosburg, Vermont and attended Enosburg 
High School. He began playing baseball in the Franklin County League and 
attended the University of Vermont where he played baseball for three years.[1] 
He was the first player out of the University of Vermont to play in the 
American League. Gardner was signed by the Boston Red Sox as an amateur 
free agent in 1908, and played his first professional game on June 25, 
1908.[2] He played most of his prime in the dead-ball era, as the third 
baseman on several successful Red Sox teams. While he was with the Red 
Sox, he played in the 1912, 1915, and 1916 World Series. Gardner homered 
in consecutive games of the '16 Series, including a three-run inside-the-park 
homer in Game 4. He played in another World Series for the Indians in 1920. 
In the famous 10th inning of the final game of 1912 World Series, the same 
inning that included Fred Snodgrass and Chief Meyers making critical fielding 
mistakes and giving the Red Sox two extra outs to work with, it was Gardner 
who drove in Steve Yerkes with the winning run of the series.[3] Gardner 
batted left-handed and threw right-handed. In his 17-season career, Larry 
Gardner posted a .289 batting average with 27 home runs and 929 RBI in 
1922 games. Gardner was inducted into Vermont's Athletic Hall of Fame in 
1969.[4] After his retirement, he returned to the University of Vermont 
as a baseball coach and athletic director from 1929 to 1951.[5] Gardner 
died on March 11, 1976 in St. George, Vermont. He was cremated and the 
location of his ashes are unknown.[6] In its December 27, 1989 issue commemorating 
the millennium, Sports Illustrated named Gardner as one of the Top 50 Vermont 
athletes of the 20th Century.[7] Gardner was inducted to the Boston Red 
Sox Hall of Fame in 2000.[8] In 2012 Gardner was inducted into the Vermont
