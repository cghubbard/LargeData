Ohio University intercollegiate athletics include six men's squads and 
nine women's squads and range from individual athletics to team sports, 
all called the Bobcats. The Bobcats are 1946 charter members of the Mid-American 
Conference, one of 11 leagues to be NCAA Division FBS, the highest competition 
level within American intercollegiate athletics. The school colors are 
Ohio Green and White.[1 1][2] A member of the Mid-American Conference, 
Ohio sponsors teams in six men's and ten women's NCAA sanctioned sports:[3] 
Men's Intercollegiate Sports Women's Intercollegiate Sports For the 2004 
bicentennial biography of the university, the institution commissioned 
a book documenting the university's history.[1 1] Betty Hollow's bicentennial 
publication Ohio University: The Spirit of a Singular Place describes many 
historical events in the university's athletic program. In her book, Hollow 
records that Frank Super, the son of university president Charles W. Super, 
took time from his electrical engineering studies to quarterback Ohio's 
first gridiron squad in 1894. Local businesses and "sympathizers", or fans, 
sported light-blue decorations and ribbons to show their support. Not only 
two years later, in 1896, did Ohio teams adopt green and white as school 
colors, chosen by the student body's vote. Hal Rowland, a former student, 
won the $10.00 contest to put forward the idea of a nickname that exemplified 
the team's tenacity and fighting spirit best: the Bobcat was born. Women's 
sports had advanced over many years at Ohio University, starting originally 
as the tennis club and participation in the field day, where women could 
only compete in the baseball throw. The football team was invited to meet 
U.S. President Herbert Hoover at the White House in 1932. Despite wide 
acclaim, football's legacy at the university is presently out-shined by 
Bobcat baseball.[1 1] Number "54" is the only number ever retired at Ohio 
University.[1 1] It belonged to Frank Baumholtz, a two-sport star and one 
of the few athletes ever to play two professional sports.[1 1] Baumholtz 
and men's basketball head coach W. J. "Dutch" Trautwein led the Cats to 
the 1941 National Invitational Tournament championship, building upon standards 
established by Butch Grover during his 16-year run as head coach from 1922 
to 1938. Larry Hunter is one on a distinguished list of coaches that also 
includes Jim Snyder, whose twenty-five seasons produced 355 wins, conference 
crowns, and NCAA and NIT appearances. Baumholtz signed with the Cincinnati 
Reds in 1941. Bob Wren, a Bobcat infielder, was named coach in 1949 and 
in his twenty-three seasons his teams won almost 500 games, never suffering 
a losing season. Future major leaguers like Phillies's Hall of Famer Mike 
Schmidt fueled Wren's powerhouse ballclubs. In fact, the 1970 team with 
Schmidt and future coach Joe Carbone as players advanced all the way to 
the College World Series, upsetting Southern California in the first round. 
Instrumental within the university administrators building equal opportunities 
for women through increased spending and scholarship support was Peggy 
Pruitt,[1 1] who retired in 2001. Building upon a tradition that has produced 
such stand-outs as Anita Corl Miller-Huntsman, Shelly Morris's field hockey 
team earned a MAC championship and an NCAA appearance in 2001. Wendy Weeden 
Devine, 1974, became the first woman inducted into the Ohio University 
Athletic Hall of Fame.[1 1] An Ohio All-American and 1964 NCAA cross-country 
champion, Elmore "Mo" Banton led the cross-country and track and field 
teams as a coach to many MAC championships and NCAA highlights. Retiring 
in 1972, baseball's Coach Wren gave way to Jerry France, who coached future 
World Series skipper Bob Brenly of the Arizona Diamondbacks. France won 
almost 400 games, and his successor Joe Carbone added another 400 victories 
to the tradition. Sporting News ranked Ohio University thirty-second in 
the nation for overall achievement in 2001, ahead of such powerhouses as 
Florida State, Iowa, Kentucky, Georgia Tech, and Kansas.[1 1] Ohio's marching 
band is The Ohio University Marching 110.[4] On October 28, 1976, the Marching 
110 became the first marching band in history to perform at Carnegie Hall.[5] 
The Marching 110 performed in Bill Clinton's first inaugural parade through 
Washington, D.C., in 1992 when Clinton personally asked his campaign chairman, 
alumnus David Wilhelm, for the band to march and perform to throngs of 
thousands of Americans greeting the new first family. The band has also 
performed at many professional football games and has taken part in the 
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in 2000 and 2005.[5] Called "The Most Exciting 
Band in the Land", the band is widely regarded as one of the best in the 
nation[1 1] and was ranked by Link Magazine in 1996 as one of the Top 10 
college marching bands in the nation.[1 1] They perform at every Ohio home 
football game. Many of those traditions are associated with athletics events 
on campus. Ohio traditions include: Varsity Ohio is the exclusive organization 
for student-athlete alumni, and sponsors the annual all-sports reunion 
during the week of Homecoming, with athletics alumni flying in from around 
the world.[6] Ohio's baseball and fastpitch softball teams have storied 
programs.[1 1] The Ohio baseball program has won 14 MAC regular season 
titles in 1947, 1948, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1960, 1964, 1965, 1968, 1968, 1969, 
1970, 1971, and 1991. The team has also won MAC tournament titles in 1997 
and 2015, and has made a College World Series appearance in 1970. There 
have been a total of 23 Bobcats in the major leagues, and hundreds more 
in the minors.[1 1] Most notably, hall of famer Mike Schmidt was a Bobcat, 
selected 30th in the 1971 Major League Baseball draft following his senior 
season. Although softball at Ohio University began earlier than the 1970s, 
records were not well kept.[7] Upon the creation of the Association of 
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), the current program began to 
take shape. The 1974 team, led by Head Coach Joyce King, went undefeated, 
boasting a record of 11-0-1. It was not until 1975 that the program made 
the switch from slow-pitch to fast-pitch. In that 1975 season,[8] the team 
went 16-1 and made it to the AIAW Women's College World Series for the 
first time in program history. The early success continued as the 1976 
team earned a spot in the Ohio State Invitational.[7] The MAC and the NCAA 
did not begin to recognize women's softball until 1980 and both neglected 
to sponsor a tournament until 1982. The first MAC tournament featured the 
Bobcats as the runner-up, losing to their rival Miami of Ohio. In her second 
season, head coach Tracy Bunge led the Bobcats to the most wins in a season 
with a record of 39-22, winning their first MAC title and their first appearance 
in the NCAA regional play.[9] In the 2014 season, the softball program 
won its first MAC tournament title. They were able to receive an automatic 
bid for the NCAA Championship tournament. During this season, they tied 
their record for most regular season wins at 32, while reaching their first 
national postseason tournament in 19 years.[7] The current head coach of 
the Bobcats is Jodi Hermanek, who accepted the position on July 17, 2008. 
Her time of coaching at Ohio University has been remarkable, leading the 
team to break their program records in total strikeouts, most wins in a 
season, and its first MAC championship title.[10] Ohio's home basketball 
games are played at the 13,080-seat Convocation Center. Located on the 
West Green of Ohio University's main campus, the venue has a seating capacity 
of 13,080. The arena was completed in 1968 and is the largest basketball 
facility in the Mid-American Conference.[1 1] The Bobcats have won over 
75% of their home games since the opening of The Convo.[1 1] Prior to playing 
at the Convo, Ohio basketball games were first played in Bentley Hall and 
then at Grover Center, two buildings that today exist as office space and 
classrooms for the university. The Convocation Center brought in its largest 
crowd on February 28, 1970, when 14,102 fans were in attendance to watch 
the Bobcats men's basketball team defeat the Bowling Green Falcons 77-76. 
Ohio is consistently one of the attendance leaders in the Mid-American 
Conference and has the ability to draw good crowds, win or lose.[1 1] The 
first Ohio basketball game occurred in 1907 when the Bobcats defeated the 
Parkersburg YMCA 46-9. Since that day, Ohio has posted a .571 winning percentage 
over their 100-year history and a .566 winning percentage in their 65 years 
in the Mid-American Conference. The Bobcats have won 6 Mid-American Conference 
tournament titles in 1983, 1985, 1994, 2005, 2010, and 2012. As well as 
9 MAC regular season titles in 1960, 1961, 1964, 1965, 1970, 1972, 1974, 
1985, and 1994. Prior to joining the MAC, the 'Cats won an Ohio Athletic 
Conference title in 1921 and three Buckeye Athletic Association championships 
in 1931, 1933, and 1937. In addition, Ohio has played in the NCAA Tournament 
13 times, appearing in 1960, 1961, 1964, 1965, 1970, 1972, 1974, 1983, 
1985, 1994, 2005, 2010, and 2012. The Bobcats have been selected for the 
National Invitation Tournament 4 times in 1941 (runner-up), 1969, 1986, 
and 1995, while also appearing in the College Basketball Invitational in 
2008. As a result of the storied tradition of Ohio Bobcats basketball, 
the program was recently ranked 86th in Street & Smith's 100 Greatest Basketball 
Programs of All Time, published in 2005.[1 1] Some of Ohio's famous men's 
basketball coaches include Jim Snyder, Danny Nee, Larry Hunter and John 
Groce. Jim Snyder led the Bobcats for 26 years (1949–1974) and helped Ohio 
to 7 NCAA Tournament appearances and one NIT appearance. Snyder's teams 
compiled a 355-255 record, good for a .581 winning percentage. Former Ohio 
coach Danny Nee led Ohio for 7 years from 1980–1986. Nee helped rebuild 
the program from several years of losing records, and he helped lead the 
team to 2 MAC Tournament titles, 2 NCAA Tournament appearances, and one 
NIT appearance. Following Nee's tenure at Ohio, he took a job as head coach 
of the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Today Nee is head coach of the Duquesne Dukes. 
Larry Hunter served as head coach of Ohio from 1989–2001, compiling a winning 
percentage of .580 (204-148). His teams made one NCAA Tournament appearance 
in 1994, an NIT appearance in 1995, and won the Pre-Season NIT in 1994. 
Despite his record as coach of the Bobcats, Hunter was relieved of his 
duties in 2001 for a lack of postseason success. Today, Hunter is head 
coach of the Western Carolina Catamounts. Ohio's head coach from 2001 to 
2008 was Tim O'Shea. Coach O'Shea resigned[11] on Monday June 23, 2008, 
in order to become the head coach of Bryant University in Rhode Island. 
Coach O'Shea had arrived at Ohio in 2001 after 4 seasons as an assistant 
coach at his alma mater, Boston College. He came to Athens on March 29, 
2001 and vowed to take the Ohio men's basketball program to what he called 
the "next level". This next level was realized in 2005 as he led to Bobcats 
to a 21-11 record, a MAC Tournament Title, and an NCAA Tournament appearance 
in which 13 seed Ohio nearly upset 4 seed Florida. O'Shea's 2005–2006 team 
proved successful as well, posting a 19-11 record with wins over teams 
such as Rhode Island and Samford, and a close loss to Kentucky. The 2006–2007 
team also posted 19 wins, with a final record of 19-13. A 20 win campaign 
was had in the 2007–2008 season, including notable non-conference wins 
over Maryland, St. John's, George Mason, and Bucknell. The team was extended 
an invite to the College Basketball Invitational, where the Bobcats advanced 
to the second round. On June 27, 2008, former Ohio State Buckeyes associate 
head coach John Groce was named the sixteenth head coach in Bobcats history. 
Groce brings fourteen years of assistant coaching experience to Athens, 
along with a pair of outright Big Ten regular-season titles, two NCAA Tournament 
appearances, a berth in the 2007 NCAA National Championship game and the 
2008 NIT title. On March 18, 2010, the men's basketball program recorded 
a 97-83 blowout of the Georgetown Hoyas. The upset marked the first time 
in NCAA tournament history that a fourteen seed defeated a three seed by 
double digits. Ohio defeated 4th seeded Michigan in the 2012 Tournament. 
They followed up the 2012 victory over Michigan with a 62–56 win over 12th 
seeded South Florida, reaching the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 
1964. On March 28, 2012, John Groce left the program to coach at the University 
of Illinois. He was replaced by Texas Christian University head coach Jim 
Christian on April 3, 2012. Christian became Ohio University's highest 
paid faculty member in school history, having a base salary of $425,000 
a year.[citation needed] He was replaced two years later on the same day 
after he got a coaching job at Boston College by Saul Phillips. Phillips 
was the head coach of North Dakota State. {main|Ohio Bobcats women's basketball}] 
The men's and women's teams are now coached by Clay Calkins, Mitch Bentley, 
and Nick Pero. The teams were previously coached by Elmore "Mo" Banton, 
a well-respected coach in running circles who became Ohio's first African 
American head coach in 1980 and stayed with the program for more than 20 
years. Many cross country runners also run for the track team in the spring, 
forming the core of the distance runners. The runners were greatly affected 
by the loss of the Men's Track program in 2007. The Ohio Men's Cross-Country 
program claims MAC titles from 1962, 1964, and 1996. Recently, distance 
athlete and Ohio's former Director of Compliance Craig Leon became a qualifier 
to the U.S. Olympic Trials for the marathon in Eugene, Oregon. Leon finished 
10th at the 2013 Boston Marathon, the same race during the 2013 Boston 
Marathon bombing.[12] Since the 2007 track team elimination, the cross-country 
squad competes in mid- and long-distance events each Spring as the Club 
Track Team at the annual Wake Forest University track meet. The Ohio Bobcats’ 
women's cross country team competes at Goldsberry Track in Athens, Ohio. 
The current head coach of the cross country and distance team is Mitch 
Bentley. Bentley is an alumnus of Ohio University, graduating with his 
bachelor's degree in geology in 1985. While on the team, he set 2 school 
records for the outdoor 10,000 meters (29:57.50) and the indoor 5,000 meter 
race. He was a four time varsity letter winner in cross country and track, 
earning two All-MAC honors for cross country, indoor, and outdoor track. 
He began his university coaching career in 2003.[13] The women's cross 
country team has been highly successful. Between 1980 and 2014, Ohio has 
had the top female runner in the MAC 7 times. During this time, four females 
have been named the first runner up for the best female athlete in the 
MAC. In 2013, Juli Accurso, became the first female runner in the MAC to 
win three consecutive conference titles. The women's cross country team 
has won the MAC Championship a total of 10 times, in the years 1987, 1988, 
1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1997, 2006, and 2007.[14] Ohio Bobcats football 
began in 1894 with an 8-0 loss to Marietta College. Since that day, the 
Bobcats have posted a 498-516-48 record over their 112-year existence and 
a 202-243-11 record over their 60 years in the Mid-American Conference. 
Peden Stadium, built in 1929, is the oldest football venue in the MAC and 
among the oldest in the nation. Located on the south of Ohio University's 
campus in Athens, the venue has a seating capacity of 24,000. In 2010, 
Peden Stadium was designated an official Ohio Historical landmark site 
after a university alumnus, Michael A Massa, advanced the idea to Ohio 
University and State of Ohio officials.[citation needed] Many recent renovation 
and expansion efforts have allowed the stadium to keep pace with the ever-changing 
landscape of college football stadiums.[1 1] As such, Peden Stadium is 
nicknamed "The Wrigley Field of College Football".[1 2] The historic stadium 
brought its largest crowd on September 8, 2012, when 25,893 fans were in 
attendance to watch the Bobcats decisively beat the New Mexico State Aggies 
by a score of 51-24.[15] This mark overtook the previous record set on 
September 5, 2009, when 24,617 fans were in attendance to watch the Bobcats 
drop a 23-16 decision to the Connecticut Huskies.[16] The third largest 
crowd came on September 9, 2005, when 24,545 fans watched the Bobcats defeat 
the Pittsburgh Panthers 16-10. The fourth largest crowd was on September 
17, 2011, when 24,422 fans watched the Bobcats defeat the Marshall Thundering 
Herd 44-7 in the Battle of the Bell. Ohio is consistently one of the attendance 
leaders in the Mid-American Conference. The Bobcats have won five MAC Football 
championships in 1953, 1960, 1963, 1967, and 1968, and MAC East Division 
championships in 2006, 2009, and 2011. Prior to joining the MAC, the Bobcats 
won six Buckeye Athletic Association championships in 1929, 1930, 1931, 
1935, 1936, and 1938. In 1960, the Bobcats were crowned National Small 
College Champions after compiling a 10-0 record under Coach Bill Hess. 
The Bobcats have appeared in six bowl games, losing 15-14 to West Texas 
State in the 1962 Sun Bowl, losing 49-42 to Richmond in the 1968 Tangerine 
Bowl, falling 28-7 to Southern Mississippi in the 2007 GMAC Bowl, losing 
21-17 to Marshall in the 2009 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl, and losing to 
Troy in the 2010 New Orleans Bowl, 48-21, before finally winning a bowl 
game in the 2011 Famous Idaho Potato Bowl against Utah State, 24-23. Some 
of Ohio's notable football coaches include Don Peden, Bill Hess, Jim Grobe, 
and current head coach Frank Solich. Peden coached from 1924–1946, compiling 
a 121-46-11 record, good for a winning percentage of .711 that still stands 
as the best ever for an Ohio football coach. Peden's teams won a total 
of 6 Buckeye Athletic Association Championships in his tenure and left 
a lasting mark on the program when the Bobcat's football stadium, Peden 
Stadium, was named in his honor following his retirement. Bill Hess's time 
at Ohio was equally impressive. Coaching from 1958–1977, Hess had a 108-91-4 
record, giving him a winning percentage of .542 that is second only to 
Peden on Ohio's all-time list. Coach Hess's teams won 4 MAC Championships, 
participated in 2 bowl games, and won a National Small College Championship 
in 1960 after having an undefeated season. Former Ohio coach Jim Grobe 
took the helm of the Bobcats program in 1995, inheriting a squad that winless 
in the previous season. Grobe quickly turned the program around, as his 
teams went 8-3 in 1997 and 7-4 in 2000. Coach Grobe had a 33-33-1 record 
in his time at Ohio, good for a .500 winning percentage that is fourth 
among all Ohio football coaches. After the 2000 football season, Grobe 
took a job as head football coach at Wake Forest University. Frank Solich 
was named the 28th football coach of the Bobcats on December 16, 2004. 
Prior to coming to Ohio, Solich spent many years as a part of the University 
of Nebraska football program, as a player, an assistant coach, and later 
as the head coach. Solich was head coach of the Cornhuskers from 1998–2003 
where he directed Nebraska to 6 consecutive bowl games, including the national 
championship game in the 2002 Rose Bowl. Solich's impact on the Ohio program 
was immediate, as plans were put in place to renovate Ohio's football facilities 
and increase financial support for the football program.[citation needed] 
Also, Ohio was selected to appear on national television 6 times for the 
2005 football season, a record for the program.[citation needed] Frank 
Solich's first home game as coach of Ohio was a memorable one, as Peden 
Stadium brought in its largest ever crowd to watch the Bobcats defeat the 
University of Pittsburgh Panthers 16-10. Under the guidance of Frank Solich, 
the Ohio football program has enjoyed a return to national prominence.[citation 
needed] On November 16, 2006 the Bobcats secured their first-ever MAC East 
Division title and their first football championship of any sort since 
1968 with a victory over the Akron Zips. They then advanced to the MAC 
Championship Game in Detroit, where they were defeated by Central Michigan 
31-10. On January 7, 2007, the Bobcats acted as the MAC representative 
in the GMAC Bowl in Mobile, Alabama, losing 28-7 to the University of Southern 
Mississippi Golden Eagles in a game nationally televised on ESPN. The Bobcats 
followed up the 2006 campaign with a 6-6 record in 2007, and was one of 
six bowl eligible programs that was not invited to post-season play. The 
Bobcats returned to the post-season in 2009, posting a 9-3 regular season 
record and another MAC East Championship. Ohio played in the MAC Championship 
Game, where they fell to Central Michigan 20-10. On December 26, 2009, 
the Bobcats fell 21-17 to the Thundering Herd in the Little Caesars Pizza 
Bowl. All players in bold are current NFL players. The Ohio Bobcats golf 
teams are two of the only teams in the MAC that possess their own golf 
course.[citation needed] Both the men's and women's teams have several 
notable victories in national tournaments and compete at regular matches 
across the country. Through the 2014 season, the men's golf team has won 
18 MAC tournament titles: 1951–55, 1957–61, 1963–65, 1967, 1969, 1971, 
1979–80 (1954 co-champions with Kent State). PGA Tour golfer Dow Finsterwald 
is among the Ohio golf program's famous alumni. Ohio's volleyball team 
has been steadily increasing national prominence:[citation needed] Under 
the direction of Coach Geoff Carlston, the team won five consecutive Mid-American 
Conference regular season championships from 2003 to 2007, and 4 consecutive 
MAC tournament titles from 2003 to 2006. The team has appeared in the NCAA 
Tournament every year since 2003, and made the "Sweet 16" of the NCAA tournament 
in 2005. Following the end of the 2007 season, Coach Geoff Carlston moved 
on to take the head coaching position at Ohio State University, with Ohio 
naming former Florida assistant Ryan Theis to the vacant head coaching 
position. Under the direction of Theis, the Bobcats have won 2 MAC regular 
season titles and have recorded 2 NCAA Tournament appearances. The 2014 
season was highly successful, with Deane Webb as their new head coach. 
Overall, the team went 23-6 on the season and remained undefeated in the 
MAC for the fourth time ever, their first since 2006.[17] They won the 
MAC East Division title for 12th time and won the MAC regular season title 
for the second year in a row, their ninth overall. Their junior setter, 
Abby Gilleland, won the MAC Player of the Year, MAC Setter of the Year, 
and First Team All-MAC honors for the second year in a row. Meredith Ashy, 
also a junior, was the first player in Ohio Bobcats history to receive 
the MAC Defensive Player of the Year award, as well as being named First 
Team All-MAC selection. Graduating senior Kelly Lamberti capped her career 
off as one of two players to receive four First Team All-MAC honors.[18] 
Ohio's women's swimming and diving team has won 11 MAC championships in 
1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 2000, 2001, 2008 and 2011. This 
is more than any other women's swimming and diving program in the conference. 
The team competes in The Ohio University Aquatic Center, one of the finest 
swimming and diving facilities in the conference. The OUAC has hosted many 
Mid-American Conference Championship meets. Paul Anastacio is considered 
their best men's swimmer ever. Women's soccer at Ohio University began 
in 1997 under head coach Wendy Logan. Logan won the MAC Coach of the Year 
award in 1997, then led the team to their first regular season MAC champion 
title in 1998. In 2000, Stacy Strauss took over the head coach position 
and remained until 2012. During this time, Strauss led the 2001 and 2004 
teams to become the MAC regular season champions. The Bobcats have never 
won the MAC tournament, though their record is 7-14.[19] The current head 
coach is Aaron Rodgers, who took over the program in 2013. He was the former 
Kentucky Wildcats assistant coach. In his first two seasons at Ohio University, 
he has led the team to a combined record of 33-0-0.[20] The current head 
coach of the program is Clay Calkins, a 1995 graduate of Malone University. 
Calkins was born and raised in East Sparta, Ohio and had success in hurdles, 
pole vault, and jumps. After accepting the position in June 2003, Calkins 
led the men's track and field teams to 4 years of success, only ending 
because of the 2007 Title IX legislation, which eliminated a total of 4 
teams. Under his coaching, the numerous female athletes have become MAC 
and Regional Champions, as well as multiple national qualifiers.[21] The 
team as a whole has won the MAC Championship in 1983, 1984, and 1994. Ohio's 
coach Diane Stamm won the MAC Women's Track Coach of the Year in the years 
1982, 1983, 1984. In 1994, Elmore Banton, Ohio head coach, became the most 
recent coach from the Bobcats to win the award.[22] The Ohio University 
wrestling program's inception was in 1919, when Thor Olson, the so-called 
"Granddaddy of Collegiate Wrestling", coached the very first Bobcat varsity 
wrestling team to a 1-1 record. The first of its kind at any university 
or institution in the state of Ohio,[1 1] that wrestling team established 
a tradition that has continued under the leadership of past coaches like 
Fred Schleicher and Harry Houska. Present coach Joel Greenlee is entering 
his 17th season as the head coach of the Bobcat wrestling program after 
helping five individuals earn bids for the 2013 NCAA Wrestling Championships.[23] 
Recent Bobcat standout wrestler Jake Percival was at the 2004 NCAA meet, 
less than 40 seconds away from becoming Ohio's fifth national champion, 
but a late two-point reversal by Stanford's Matt Gentry in the 157-pound 
finals resulted in a second-place finish for Percival as the Bobcats placed 
25th in the country under the guidance of Greenlee. Percival, the three-time 
MAC Wrestler of the Year, became the first four-time All-American in MAC 
history with a third-place finish at nationals in 2005. During his senior 
season, the Elyria native passed Enright (115-31) and Gardner (122-26) 
to become the school's all-time wins leader. He ended his career with a 
142-10 record, including 18-6 in the NCAA Tournament, 113-4 during the 
regular season and a 17-0 mark in the conference. Ohio University wrestling 
home dual meets and tournaments take place in the Convocation Center located 
on campus. MAC Championships in parentheses: On January 25, 2007, then-Athletic 
Director Kirby Hocutt announced the elimination of four varsity sports 
at Ohio University. Those sports include: men's swimming and diving, men's 
indoor track, men's outdoor track and women's lacrosse. The decision was 
announced without any advance warning to the student athletes involved 
causing major tension between the student body and the administration. 
The Athletic Department later revealed that the money saved would be reinvested 
in forcible sports.[25][26][27] Ohio's athletic facilities and the teams 
that utilize them are as follows: The Kermit Blosser Ohio Athletics Hall 
of Fame was established in 1965. Inductees to the Blosser Ohio Athletics 
Hall of Fame are inducted during banquet ceremonies the evening prior to 
a designated home football game. Inductees are also recognized during a 
special halftime ceremony at the football game the following day. A portrait 
and accomplishments are displayed in the Ohio Athletics Hall of Fame located 
in the Convocation Center. Jim Schaus was named the new Director of Athletics 
at Ohio University by President Roderick J. McDavis on April 7, 2008. Before 
accepting the job at Ohio, Schaus served in the same capacity at Wichita 
State University for 9 years.[28] Schaus replaced Kirby Hocutt, who took 
the Director of Athletics position at the University of Miami. Schaus' 
senior staff at Ohio includes: Amy Dean (Senior Associate AD/Administration 
& Sport Programs), Dan Hauser (Associate AD/External Operations), Lauren 
Ashman (Associate AD/Compliance), Randee Duffy (Associate AD/NCAA Eligibility 
& Student Athlete Success), Ryan White (Associate AD/Development), Tim 
Knavel (Associate AD/Business Operations) and Matt Molde (General Manager 
Ohio IMG Sports Marketing). NCAA guidelines promote student-athletes across 
several leadership channels for decision making.[30] The university nominates 
a student-athlete each year to represent Ohio University at the annual 
NCAA National Student-Athlete Leadership and Development Conference, where 
ambassadors from universities across the country converge to discuss pressing 
issues facing their campus's athletes.[31][32] Student ambassadors then 
give executive recommendations to their departments. The university sponsors 
a trio of student-athletes to attend the NCAA's annual APPLE Conference 
on Drugs & Alcohol, along with administration advisors, to learn more about 
implementing wellness programming into athletic life at Ohio University.[33] 
After the election for Student Senate in 2008, students initiated the position 
of Athletic Affairs Senator to be the voting member for student-athletes 
inside the Ohio University Student Senate. The Athletic Affairs Senator 
must first be elected Vice President of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee 
(or S.A.A.C.). S.A.A.C. is composed of five officers, usually of different 
athletic teams, and influences department-wide activities for student-athletes.[34] 
Furthermore, each team usually elects its own captain during the teams' 
end-of-season dinners; results are presented later at practices or via 
email. Coaches have played more of a role in the determination process 
in recent years, and some teams maintain devolved captainships. During 
the 2011 Student Senate election, the social democratic of the two major 
parties held the first formal nominating process. A men's cross-country 
runner became the vice presidential candidate and that election saw the 
highest percentage of voters turnout, with 4,057 votes cast representing 
roughly 20 percent of the student body, and despite the election's outcome, 
was a pivotal moment for athletes' voices.[35][36] The 2011 election set 
a course for student-trustee suffrage throughout the state; drew attention 
to Budget Planning Council meetings' inaccessibility; and highlighted the 
plight facing student-employees.[37] The result fomented a linear case 
for the 2014 election outcome. Between 2011 and 2012, the university administration 
sponsored a select committee for leveraging talks for a multipurpose center 
for the football program.[38] The student-athletes' leadership both at 
the S.A.A.C. and Student Senate levels were represented by runners who 
were adversely effected and negatively impacted by the loss of the men's 
track program. As talks progressed, athletes from various backgrounds worked 
together for proposals about the interior design of the facility, ultimately 
persuading the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics to construct an 
indoor track. Although discussion over the size of the track varied, the 
department honored the work of the athletes by incorporating a track into 
the blueprints. As the budget for the planned facility was discussed, proposals 
centered on moving expenditures for the building's facade into the interior 
expenses.[39] Despite the addition of the track into the financial plan, 
the student body's general fee was invoked as a means to finish the building 
without subtractions from the exterior.[40] Therefore, the Department of 
Student Affairs was enlisted to manage the day-to-day operations of the 
building as cost adjustments pan out over the years after construction. 
The building was dedicated after nearly five years of planning on August 
26, 2014, track included.[41] The official radio home of the Ohio Bobcats 
is the Ohio IMG Sports Network. The first MAC network to reach into Columbus, 
the Ohio IMG Sports Network continues to serve the university's alumni 
base and fans in other parts of southeastern Ohio and parts of northern 
West Virginia and eastern Kentucky. The radio voice of the Bobcats is Russ 
Eisenstein with Rob Cornelius as color analyst for Bobcat football and 
men's basketball and Tom Hodson as the football sideline reporter.[42] 
The network features 13 radio affiliations throughout southeast and central
