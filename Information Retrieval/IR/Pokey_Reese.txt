Calvin "Pokey" Reese, Jr. (born June 10, 1973), is a former American Major 
League Baseball infielder. Reese played with the Cincinnati Reds (1997-2001), 
Pittsburgh Pirates (2002-2003), and Boston Red Sox (2004). He batted and 
threw right-handed. Reese got his nickname "Pokey" because he was an obese 
baby and his grandmother was going to call him Porkey, but accidentally 
called him Pokey. Reese was known for his defense, winning two Gold Gloves 
during his career.[1] Reese was born in Columbia, South Carolina and began 
his baseball career with the Princeton Reds of the Rookie-level Appalachian 
League in 1991. The next season, he moved up to Single-A, joining the Charleston 
Wheelers of the South Atlantic League. He made his Major League debut with 
the Reds in 1997 and played with the team through 2001, winning two Gold 
Glove Awards along the way. Following the 2001 season, he spent time on 
four different teams in a span of 45 days. On December 18, he was traded 
to the Colorado Rockies and the next day he was traded to the Red Sox for 
first baseman Scott Hatteberg, but the Red Sox did not tender him a contract, 
making him a free agent two days later. On January 30, 2002, he signed 
with the Pirates. In 2003, Reese turned down a higher-paying deal from 
Pittsburgh to play for the Red Sox, and in 2004, he was part of Boston's 
first World Series win since 1918. On May 8, 2004, at Fenway Park, Reese 
had the first two-homer game of his career in a Red Sox 9-1 victory over 
the Kansas City Royals. Reese hit an inside-the-park home run and one over 
the Green Monster, to snap a 172 at-bat homerless streak dating back to 
April 4, 2003. The last Red Sox player to hit a conventional homer and 
an inside-the-park homer in the same game was Tony Armas on September 24, 
1983, at Tiger Stadium. Reese fielded a ground ball from Rub√©n Sierra and 
threw to Doug Mientkiewicz for the final out of the 2004 ALCS, as the Red 
Sox won their first pennant since 1986, while winning the World Series 
a week later. On January 5, 2005, he signed with the Seattle Mariners, 
but never played in a game before being put on the 60-day disabled list 
and missing the entire season due to injury. In 2006, Reese signed a one-year 
deal with the Florida Marlins; however, his contract was terminated on 
March 5, 2006, after he left the club on March 1 and did not have direct 
contact with anyone on the team for over 72 hours. In 2008, Reese signed 
a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals and played for Triple-A 
Columbus where in two games he strained both hamstrings and was placed 
on the DL for several weeks. On July 3, 2008, he returned from the disabled 
list to Single-A Hagerstown, but was quickly sent back up again to Triple-A 
Columbus. He became a free agent at the end of the season, after which 
he retired from professional baseball. At the plate, Reese struck out much 
more often than he walked, posting a career 0.43 walk-to-strikeout ratio 
(226-to-531). Reese was a high-percentage base stealer (144-for-170), Reese 
had a career .307 on-base percentage. In an eight-year career, Reese was 
a .248 hitter with 44 home runs and 271 RBI in 856 games. In May 2015, 
Reese was named the high school baseball coach at his alma mater, Lower
