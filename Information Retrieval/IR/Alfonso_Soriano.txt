Alfonso Guilleard Soriano (born January 7, 1976) is a Dominican former 
professional baseball left fielder and second baseman. He played in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, 
and Washington Nationals, and in Nippon Professional Baseball for the Hiroshima 
Toyo Carp. Soriano began his professional career with Hiroshima in 1996, 
but signed with the Yankees as a free agent in 1998 and was assigned to 
play in minor league baseball. The next year, he was the Most Valuable 
Player (MVP) in the All-Star Futures Game, and made his MLB debut for the 
Yankees, with whom he would win two American League championships. The 
Yankees traded Soriano to the Rangers after the 2003 season, and the Rangers 
traded Soriano to the Nationals after the 2005 season. He signed a contract 
as a free agent with the Cubs before the 2007 season. The Cubs traded Soriano 
to the Yankees in 2013, and the Yankees released him in 2014. Soriano was 
a seven-time MLB All-Star, and won the All-Star Game MVP Award in 2004. 
He won the Silver Slugger Award four times. He played primarily as a second 
baseman for the Yankees and Rangers before being converted to an outfielder 
with the Nationals. Soriano is one of only 54 major league players to hit 
400 or more career home runs, and was seventh among active players in home 
runs at the time of his retirement. Soriano began his professional baseball 
career in Japan with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp, training at their Carp Academy 
for Dominican players. Soriano spent 1996 playing in Japan in the minor 
Western League.[1] In 1997, he was promoted to the varsity team, and, wearing 
uniform number 74, he appeared in nine games, batting .118 (2 for 17) with 
two walks.[2] Soriano disliked the intense Japanese practice schedule, 
and the Carp denied him a salary increase from $45,000 to $180,000 per 
year.[3] Like Hideo Nomo and Hideki Irabu, who had previously left Japan 
to play in the United States, Soriano hired Don Nomura to help his situation. 
After first attempting to void Soriano's Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) 
contract by unsuccessfully arguing that the player was legally a minor 
when he signed it, Nomura advised him, like Nomo, to retire from NPB and 
pursue a career in MLB. This prompted Carp executives to file an injunction 
against Soriano, and to send letters to MLB teams demanding that they cease 
all negotiations with him. After the Nomo case, NPB officials had amended 
the Working Agreement without consulting any MLB officials in an attempt 
to prevent the situation from recurring. Since MLB had not agreed to any 
changes to the agreement, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig declared that MLB 
would recognize Soriano as a free agent on July 13, 1998, and the Carp 
backed down.[4] Soriano signed as a free agent with the New York Yankees 
in 1998,[3] starting his career as an infielder, first as a third baseman, 
and then moved over to second base. Soriano was named to the All-Star Futures 
Game in 1999. He won the game's most valuable player award after hitting 
two home runs in the contest.[5] He played in New York for five seasons. 
His first hit in MLB came in 1999 when he hit a game-winning home run against 
Norm Charlton of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He finished in third place for 
Rookie of the Year honors in 2001. In the World Series that year, he hit 
the go-ahead home run off Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Curt Schilling in 
the seventh game, but Arizona won anyway when Luis Gonzalez hit his series-winning 
single on a cut fastball by closer Mariano Rivera. In 2002, Soriano became 
the second Yankee in franchise history to record 30 home runs and 30 stolen 
bases in the same season (the first being Bobby Bonds in 1975), then repeated 
the feat in 2003. Also in 2002, he led the American League with 696 at 
bats, 209 hits, 92 extra base hits, 41 stolen bases, 128 runs and set a 
Yankees' team record for most at bats (696) and most strikeouts (157) in 
a season. He is one of only six players active as of 2009 who finished 
a 30-homer season with more homers than walks (39 HR, 23 BB), the others 
being Ryan Braun (34–29 in 2007), Garret Anderson (35–24 in 2000), Iván 
Rodríguez (35–24 in 1999), Joe Crede (30–28 in 2006), and José Guillén 
(31–24 in 2003).[6] In 2003, Soriano set the record for most home runs 
to lead off a game in a season with 13, and for the second straight year, 
led the league in at bats, and finished in the top five for base hits, 
doubles, home runs, stolen bases, and strikeouts. In 2004, the Yankees 
traded Soriano to the Texas Rangers, along with minor leaguer Joaquin Árias 
for Alex Rodriguez and cash amounting to $67 million of the $179 million 
remaining on Rodríguez' contract.[7][8] On May 8, 2004, Soriano had six 
hits in nine innings—the first Texas Ranger to do so—in a 16–15, 10-inning 
victory over the Detroit Tigers. The game featured an hour-long fifth inning, 
where Detroit scored eight runs in the top half of the inning to take a 
ten-run lead over the Rangers, only to see Texas score ten runs in the 
bottom half of the inning to tie the game, the largest deficit ever overcome 
by the Rangers and tying an MLB record for most runs in an inning by two 
teams.[9] That same year, Soriano was elected to the All-Star Game as the 
starting second baseman. He hit a three-run home run off Roger Clemens 
in the first inning and was named the MVP of the game.[10] In 2005 he finished 
sixth in the AL for stolen bases, and third for extra base hits (as well 
as eighth in strikeouts). On December 7, 2005, Soriano was traded to the 
Washington Nationals in exchange for Brad Wilkerson, Terrmel Sledge, and 
minor league pitcher Armando Galarraga.[11] On February 10, 2006, Soriano 
set a record for the highest salary ever awarded in arbitration, receiving 
$10 million, even though he lost his request of $12 million.[12] The previous 
high had been set in 2001 by Andruw Jones of the Atlanta Braves when he 
earned $8.2 million. The Nationals offered Soriano a five-year, $50-million 
extension, but Soriano rejected the offer.[13] Soriano and his agent Diego 
Bentz instead opted to open contract negotiations during the off-season, 
so that he would become a free agent. On March 20, 2006, Nationals manager 
Frank Robinson inserted Soriano in the lineup as the left fielder. Soriano, 
who since 2001 had played exclusively at second base, refused to take the 
field, and the Nationals organization threatened him with disqualification, 
which would have meant forfeiture of his salary, and he would not have 
received credit for service time in fulfillment of the obligations of his 
contract. With his contract's service terms officially still unfulfilled, 
he would then have been ineligible for free agency at season's end.[14] 
Two days later, Soriano relented and played in left field for the Nationals 
in their exhibition game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Robinson indicated 
that he considered Soriano's move to left field to be permanent and would 
not consider moving Soriano back to second base at any point during the 
season. In his comments following that game, Soriano indicated that he 
would accept his new position without further argument. As the season got 
underway, however, Soriano began to enjoy his new position, and by the 
All-Star break, he led the league in outfield assists and became one of 
the few players ever to start the All-Star game at two different positions.[14] 
Soriano set a new career high in walks with 67 (previously 38). He also 
reached a career high in home runs with 46 (previously 39). He also had 
41 stolen bases. On August 25, a week after reaching 30–30, he became the 
fastest man in baseball history to reach 200 home runs and 200 stolen bases, 
reaching the mark in 929 games (breaking the previous record of 1,053 games 
held by Eric Davis).[15] In September, he completed his 20th outfield assist, 
becoming the only player in baseball history with 40 home runs, 40 stolen 
bases, and 20 assists.[16] On September 16, 2006, Soriano stole second 
base in the first inning to become the fourth player to join the 40–40 
club, after José Canseco, Barry Bonds, and Alex Rodriguez. Many considered 
Soriano's 40-40 season to be the only one 'clean' as Canseco, Bonds and 
Rodriguez were all involved in the steroid controversy, he is also the 
only one of the four reaching the feat in playing at home. Six days later 
he became the first player to reach 40 home runs, 40 stolen bases and 40 
doubles in one season.[17] Soriano, making his fifth consecutive All-Star 
team, became only the third man to start All-Star games for both leagues 
at two different positions. As the trading deadline of July 31 approached, 
the Nationals were in a dilemma. On one hand, Soriano had initially expressed 
his distaste for playing left field, and he was in the last year of his 
contract, which would grant him free agency at the end of the season. If 
the Nationals lost Soriano at the end of the season, they would receive 
a first or second round draft pick from the team that signed him and a 
"sandwich" pick between the first and second rounds as compensation. Soriano 
did not want to engage in contract negotiations during the season. On the 
other hand, as the deadline approached, Soriano expressed his enjoyment 
with left field, and his strong desire to stay with the team.[18] Both 
fans and players began to be more vocal in their support to keep Soriano. 
Manager Frank Robinson praised Soriano's leadership in the clubhouse, and 
further suggested that Soriano should be considered for MVP of the National 
League. There were plenty of suitors, including sending Soriano back to 
the Yankees, and the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers were also interested. 
In the end, Nationals general manager Jim Bowden felt that what he was 
offered was not worth trading him.[19] The Nationals hoped to sign him 
to a long term deal before the season ended but on October 12, 2006 he 
rejected a $70M deal.[20] The Chicago Cubs signed Soriano to an eight-year 
contract worth nearly $136 million.[21] The contract marked the most expensive 
deal in the Cubs' franchise history and goes through 2014.[21] It contains 
a no-trade clause, meaning Soriano cannot be traded without his consent. 
The Cubs' manager, Lou Piniella, assigned Soriano to play center field,[22] 
but later moved him to left field after he sustained a hamstring injury.[23] 
He struggled during the first month of the season, during which he posted 
a .270 batting average, with no home runs.[24] He managed to hit his first 
home run during the Cubs' first game in May, and gradually increased his 
batting average throughout the month.[24] Soriano was extremely productive 
in June. In a game against the Atlanta Braves, Soriano hit three home runs 
off Lance Cormier.[25] Soriano had accomplished the same feat in his past, 
coincidentally, also against the Atlanta Braves.[26] Soriano also played 
an integral part in the Cubs' offense during the team's annual Cross-town 
Classic with the Chicago White Sox at US Cellular Field. He hit home runs 
in three consecutive games,[27] and single-handedly out scored the entire 
White Sox's offense.[24][28] His efforts merited the National League's 
Player of the Month title for June.[29] He was later selected as a reserve 
outfielder in the 2007 MLB All-Star Game,[30] where he hit a two-run home 
run for the National League in the bottom of the ninth inning.[31] Soriano 
led the Cubs in home runs during their National League Central chase in 
June and July, during which they erased the Milwaukee Brewers' eight game 
lead over the division.[32] After losing the tie for first in early August, 
Soriano tore his right quadriceps during a game against the New York Mets 
on August 5.[33] The Cubs placed him on the fifteen-day disabled list, 
and expected him to miss several weeks while recovering from the injury.[33] 
The Cubs used Matt Murton, who had been recalled from the Triple-A Iowa 
Cubs, in left field.[34] He began to show signs of improvement around on 
August 21, when he was seen running and working out with trainers.[35] 
Soriano stated he felt healthy enough to return in a few days,[35] but 
made his actual return on August 28, 2007.[36] Upon his return, Soriano 
proceeded to have the most productive September in the franchise's history. 
He hit fourteen home runs, twenty-seven runs batted in, and recorded a 
.320 batting average within twenty-nine games. Soriano said upon his return 
from the quad injury that he had also been suffering from wrist injuries 
and the time off to heal his leg also helped his wrists.[37] The Cubs went 
on to win the National League Central Division, but were swept by the Arizona 
Diamondbacks in the National League Division Series. Soriano finished the 
season with thirty-three home runs (including eleven lead-off home runs), 
seventy runs batted in, and a .299 batting average.[24] He led the Cubs 
in home runs, triples, runs, strikeouts, and Slugging percentage, among 
all regular starters.[38] During the first few weeks of the 2008 season 
with the Cubs, Soriano struggled. He was only hitting .190 at the time 
he was put on the DL with a bad leg. After being activated, Soriano got 
off to a quick start, raising his average to .280 and increasing his home 
run total. In a one-week stretch in May, he hit 7 home runs in just 6 games, 
hitting nearly .500 during that stretch. At the end of May he had 12 home 
runs and 33 RBIs. However, his defense was extremely poor, and after being 
placed on the DL early in the season, Soriano was encouraged to stop hopping 
as he caught fly balls.[39] This seemed to affect his play in the field 
as he misjudged two balls in St. Louis on May 2, shortly after being activated. 
After being severely booed by Cub fans who had traveled to St. Louis in 
that particular game,[40] he homered in the ninth to send the game to extra 
innings.[41] Later that month, he lost a ball in the sun and dropped what 
would have been the game's final out in the 9th inning against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, allowing Jason Bay to reach safely and eventually costing the 
Cubs a win.[42] On June 11, 2008, Soriano was hit by a pitch and broke 
a bone just under the ring finger in his left hand.[43] On July 7, 2008, 
Soriano was voted a starter in the 2008 MLB All-Star Game. However, due 
to the injury, he was replaced in the starting lineup by Matt Holliday 
of the Colorado Rockies.[44] As poor as Alfonso's defense is perceived 
to be, his arm has been just as much an asset to the Cubs, and he was one 
of the league's leaders in outfield assists. Soriano also led the team 
in home runs, despite having played in only 109 games. On August 22, Soriano 
accomplished one of baseball's rarest feats, as he stole home plate in 
a loss to his old team, the Washington Nationals.[45] In early September, 
Soriano helped end the Cubs six-game losing streak by slugging out three 
home runs with five RBI against the Cincinnati Reds. It marked the third 
three-home run game of his career. However, as the Cubs went into the playoffs 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Soriano, like nearly everyone else on 
the team, hit poorly in the NLDS. Soriano had an embarrassing moment in 
a day-night double header on Wednesday, August 13, 2008, where he hit a 
long ball which he thought was a home run. He watched it, and slowly trotted 
down to 1st, yet the ball never left the park. He wound up with only a 
single. Between games, he apologized to his team and promised that it would 
never happen again. Soriano had gotten off to a quick start, hitting a 
solo home run in his first at bat of the 2009 season.[46] Soriano also 
hit a game tying solo home run off LaTroy Hawkins in the 8th inning in 
the second game of the young season. On April 11, Soriano hit a 2-run home 
run off of Carlos Villanueva in the top of the ninth giving the Cubs a 
6 to 5 victory over rival Milwaukee. Comcast Sportsnet awarded Soriano 
with "Play of the Day.".[47] Soriano homered again, the very next day, 
on the first pitch he saw from Jeff Suppan, his 51st lead-off home run. 
On April 17 with one out in the bottom of the eighth, Soriano hit a two 
run home run to give the Cubs an 8–7 lead over the St. Louis Cardinals.[48] 
However, Soriano only hit .216 in the month of May.[49] In voting for the 
2009 All-Star Game, Soriano was fourth among NL outfielders (2,692,994 
votes), trailing Ryan Braun (4,138,559), Raúl Ibáñez (4,053,355), and Carlos 
Beltrán (2,812,295).[50] Shortly before the All-Star break, manager Lou 
Piniella dropped Soriano in the batting order and made it clear that it 
was not a temporary change. For the first time in his career, Soriano seemed 
to accept not being a leadoff hitter and actually praised his manager for 
making the necessary decision, citing the fact that "I'm not doing my job." 
The batting order change helped Soriano. In the first series after the 
All-Star break, he hit two go-ahead home runs against the Nationals. On 
July 27, he hit a walk-off grand slam against the Houston Astros during 
the 13th inning. In September 2009, Soriano underwent arthroscopic surgery 
on his left knee.[51] In 2009, Soriano led all major league left fielders 
in errors, with 11, and had the lowest fielding percentage among them (.950).[52] 
After a poor season in 2009, Soriano was placed permanently in the 6th 
spot in the Cubs lineup, where he rebounded nicely, by playing in the most 
games(147 games) that season for the Cubs. He also collected 40 doubles, 
and 79 RBIs. On June 11, 2010, Soriano hit his 300th home run off of Jake 
Peavy. In 2010, on defense he led major league left fielders in errors, 
with 7, and had the lowest fielding percentage, at .968.[53] In 2011, Soriano 
had a less than stellar year on defense and led in errors by a left fielder, 
with 7, and had the lowest fielding percentage, at .965.[54] He batted 
.244, drove in 88 runs, and hit 26 home runs.[55] 2012 was Soriano's best 
year in some time, hitting 32 home runs, his best batting average in years 
(.262) and his personal best for RBIs (108), which ranked third in the 
National League.[56] In the field, he made only one error, which was also 
Soriano's personal best on the field. Soriano started the 2013 season with 
the Cubs by playing 93 games with a .254 average, 17 home runs, and 51 
RBI. Soriano's batting average and home run production for the Cubs was 
especially strong in June and July, making him a hot commodity as the trading 
deadline approached. On July 26, 2013, the Cubs traded Soriano to the New 
York Yankees, who will be paying him $5 million prorated for 2013 and $5 
million of the $18 million owed to him in 2014. The Cubs received pitcher 
Corey Black from the Single-A Tampa Yankees.[57] On August 11, 2013, Soriano 
recorded his 2,000th career hit, a home run off of Detroit Tigers pitcher 
Justin Verlander.[58] On August 13, 2013, Soriano hit two home runs and 
had a career-high six RBIs. The next day, he broke his career high set 
the previous day by driving in seven RBIs. He became one of only three 
players in the live-ball era to drive in at least six runs in back-to-back 
games (the other two being Rusty Greer in 1997 and Geoff Jenkins in 2001). 
He also became just one of seven players to record 13 RBI in a two-game 
span, and fell just two RBI short of the all-time record set by former 
Yankee Tony Lazzeri.[59] From August 13 to 16, Soriano batted in 18 runs 
over four games, tying the Major League record for most RBI in four consecutive 
games. Soriano also recorded 13 hits during this stretch, becoming the 
only player in MLB history with 18 RBI and at least 12 hits in a four-game 
stretch. The other players who have recorded 18 RBI in four games are Jim 
Bottomley (St. Louis Cardinals, July 6–9, 1929), Lou Gehrig (New York Yankees, 
July 29–31, 1930), Tony Lazzeri (New York Yankees, May 21–24, 1936), Joe 
DiMaggio (New York Yankees, August 28—September 1, 1939), and Sammy Sosa 
(Chicago Cubs, August 8–11, 2002).[60] Soriano was named the AL Player 
of the Week for August 12–18.[61] On August 27, Soriano hit two home runs, 
the second of which was the 400th of his career.[62] For the rest of the 
2013 season with the Yankees, Soriano played 58 games batting .256 with 
17 home runs and 50 RBI. Overall in 2013, combined with the two teams, 
Soriano played 151 total games batting .255 with 34 home runs and 101 RBI.[63] 
With the signings of Carlos Beltrán and Jacoby Ellsbury, Soriano started 
the 2014 season as the designated hitter and sometimes played at right 
field. His playing time became limited as he struggled at the plate. Soriano 
was designated for assignment by the Yankees on July 6, 2014.[64][65] He 
was released on July 14.[66] In 67 games, Soriano batted .221 with 6 home 
runs and 23 RBI. Soriano announced his retirement on November 4, 2014. 
He stated: "I've lost the love and passion to play the game. Right now, 
my family is the most important thing. Although I consider myself in great 
shape, my mind is not focused on baseball."[67] Soriano's 412 career home 
runs put him in 50th place on the all-time list at the time of his retirement.[67] 
Soriano led all major league second basemen in errors every year from 2001 
to 2005 (19 (tied), 23, 19, 23, and 21). In 2006 he was second in the major 
leagues of all left fielders in errors, with 11, but led all left fielders 
with 22 assists, 9 double plays, and a 2.29 range factor. Soriano's paternal 
family, Guilleard(s), are of Haitian descent.[68] Soriano and his wife 
Carmen Isis Eusebio have three daughters named Alisis, Angeline, and Alisha, 
and three sons named Allen, Angel, and Alfonso Jr.[69] On June 23, 2004, 
Soriano donated US$2.6 million to his home country for children wanting
