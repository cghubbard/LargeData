Johnny Cueto Ortiz (Spanish: [ˈkweto]; born February 15, 1986) is a Dominican 
professional baseball pitcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the Cincinnati Reds from 2008 
through 2015 and the Kansas City Royals in 2015. He was traded from the 
Reds to the Royals during the 2015 season, where he won the 2015 World 
Series over the New York Mets. Cueto made his major league debut in 2008, 
delivering an outstanding performance, but struggling with consistency 
in his rookie year and 2009. By 2010 though, Cueto began to become a more 
consistent starting pitcher, and by 2011 he had emerged as the ace of the 
Reds pitching staff and one of the top pitchers in the National League. 
He won 19 games and posted a 2.78 ERA in 2012, finishing fourth in the 
voting for the National League Cy Young Award and helping lead the Reds 
to the NL Central title. In 2014 he won 20 games with a 2.25 ERA and tied 
for the NL lead in strikeouts with 242, finishing as the runner up for 
the Cy Young. In 2016 he won 18 games with the San Francisco Giants while 
posting a 2.79 ERA, helping lead them to the postseason, where they lost 
in the NLDS. He was an MLB All-Star in 2014 and 2016, and was chosen as 
the starting pitcher for the 2016 MLB All-Star Game. Since 2011, Cueto 
has the second lowest ERA of all pitchers with at least 500 innings pitched 
(behind Clayton Kershaw), accumulating a 2.73 ERA in over 1,100 innings 
across the past six seasons. Cueto was in the Minor Leagues for three seasons, 
and has excelled at many levels, but really turned heads during the 2007 
season. Cueto started his career for the Gulf Coast Reds of the Rookie 
Gulf Coast League, posting a 5.02 ERA, before being promoted to the High-A 
Sarasota Reds of the Florida State League, where he finished his 2005 season. 
Johnny has had progressively better seasons since. In 2006, Cueto was placed 
in Low A Dayton, blasting out of the gates, and posting a 2.61 ERA, and 
a 0.88 WHIP. While with Dayton, on May 13, 2006, he threw a rain shortened 
no-hitter against Wisconsin.[1] He was later promoted back to Sarasota, 
where he finished his season for the second consecutive year. Poised for 
a breakout 2007, Cueto was placed, once again, in Sarasota. He pitched 
14 games in Sarasota, before going on a hot streak, and advancing through 
three levels in one season. He burnt through AA Chattanooga, and AAA Louisville 
throughout the rest of his 2007 campaign.[2] He was named the Reds' Minor 
League Pitcher of the Year for the second consecutive season.[3] Cueto 
made his Major League debut on April 3, 2008, for the Reds at home against 
the Arizona Diamondbacks, where he carried a perfect game through five 
innings before surrendering a home run to Justin Upton in the top of the 
sixth inning. The home run was the only baserunner he allowed, striking 
out 10 in 7 innings. Cueto was credited with the win in his debut, as the 
Reds hung on to win 3–2. Cueto was the first Red since 1900 to throw ten 
strikeouts in his Major League debut. He was also the first MLB pitcher 
to have 10 strikeouts and 0 walks in his debut. He was the third in MLB 
history to have 10 strikeouts and give up only 1 hit.[4] For the game, 
Cueto's ERA was 1.29 on 92 pitches. Despite his impressive debut, Cueto 
was inconsistent for the most part on the season. At the end of the 2008 
campaign, he finished with a 9–14 record with an ERA of 4.81. While he 
pitched only 174 innings, Cueto struck 158 batters, good for a K/9 ratio 
of 8.17, the eighth best in the National League. Cueto started 2009 as 
the Reds #4 starter. Cueto's ERA was initially one of the best in the majors, 
leading the NL at one point at 2.17. His BB/9 lowered as the 2009 season 
progressed. He found the strike zone more often, resembling the 2008 performance 
of his teammate Edinson Vólquez. On July 6, 2009, Cueto suffered the worst 
defeat in his young career. Taking the mound against the Phillies, he was 
shelled; Cueto allowed 9 earned runs on 5 hits, walking 3.[5] To top it 
off, all this happened in the first inning, and Cueto was taken out of 
the game after only recording two outs. The Phillies scored 10 runs that 
inning. Cueto would finish the season with a record of 11–11, and an ERA 
of 4.41 in 30 starts. In 171⅓ innings, Cueto struck out 132 batters, but 
still walked 61 batters, resulting in a lower K/BB ratio than his rookie 
season (2.32 versus 2.16). Cueto started the 2010 season as the Reds' third 
starter. After getting off to an average start, Cueto delivered arguably 
his best performance since his debut on May 11, pitching a one hit shutout 
against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He struck out eight, walked none and hit 
one batter, leading the Reds to a 9–0 victory. On August 12, Cueto was 
suspended 7 games for what Major League Baseball described as his "violent 
and aggressive actions" in a bench-clearing brawl in the first inning of 
the Reds' August 10 game against the St. Louis Cardinals.[6] While pinned 
to the backstop, Cueto began kicking wildly at various Cardinals, injuring 
Chris Carpenter and Jason LaRue.[7][8] LaRue suffered a severe concussion 
in the brawl, and was forced to retire after the season. Cueto finished 
the 2010 season with a 12–7 record and a 3.64 ERA in 31 starts, pitching 
185⅔ innings, striking out 138 batters, but giving up only 56 walks, 19 
home runs and 181 hits. In Game 3 of the NLDS, he allowed 2 runs (1 earned) 
in 5 innings and took the loss as Cole Hamels pitched a shutout. Following 
the 2010 season, the Reds[9] and Cueto agreed to a 4-year, $27 million 
contract. Cueto began the season on the disabled list and returned on May 
8. Since he missed a lot of starts from being on the disabled-list, he 
didn't become eligible for the ERA race until his start against the San 
Francisco Giants on July 31, where he pitched a 3 hit, complete game shutout. 
He then took the Major League Baseball lead with a 1.72 ERA. He lost eligibility, 
twice, due to lack of innings since, but retook the National League lead 
in ERA after throwing 7 innings of shutout ball against the Colorado Rockies 
on August 11. As the season progressed, Cueto began incorporating more 
and more of a turn to his windup. At the start of the season, his windup 
featured a conventional step, keeping his body pointed at third base before 
delivering to the plate. However, by late July, Cueto's torso faces second 
base and he pauses for a brief moment. Many people have compared this turn 
to Boston Red Sox great Luis Tiant's famous turn. As of August 25, he was 
tied with Jered Weaver for the best ERA in all of Major League Baseball 
at 2.03. On August 28, Cueto struck out a career-high 11 batters against 
the Washington Nationals, receiving a no-decision as he threw seven innings 
of two-run ball. Cueto's bid for the ERA title and season came to end after 
he strained a muscle in his back on September 15, while pitching vs the 
Cubs. On September 20, the team decided to shut down Cueto for the year 
without risking further injury.[10] Cueto finished the season with a 9-5 
record and a 2.31 ERA in 156.0 innings across 24 starts – only 6 full innings 
short of qualifying for the ERA title. Cueto struck out 104 batters, and 
gave up just 123 hits, 47 walks and eight home runs. Cueto started on Opening 
Day for the Reds and went on to win 19 games against only 9 losses with 
a 2.78 earned run average in 33 starts, giving up 205 hits and 15 home 
runs across 217 innings and striking out 170 batters, while walking just 
49. Cueto also threw two complete games. In his first one, on May 4 against 
the Pirates, Cueto allowed just one run on seven hits, striking out four 
and giving up no walks. Cueto threw another complete game against the Cleveland 
Indians on June 12, giving up just one run on six hits, with seven strikeouts 
and no walks. During an eleven start stretch between May 30 and July 28, 
Cueto threw 81⅓ innings without allowing a home run, a stretch in which 
he posted an 8-3 record with a 2.27 ERA. His streak came to an end on August 
2, when Eddy Rodriguez hit a home run off Cueto in a game versus the Brewers. 
Cueto threw 23 quality starts, and ranked third in wins and ERA, fourth 
in complete games, fifth in innings pitched, eighth in hits allowed and 
ninth in winning percentage in the National League, while breaking his 
career bests in all of those categories. Thanks to Cueto's brilliant season, 
the Reds clinched the NL Central Division title for the second time in 
three years, and the second best record in baseball (97-65) behind the 
Washington Nationals. Cueto started game 1 of the National League Division 
Series against San Francisco, but had to leave after only eight pitches 
because of a strained muscle in his back. After the Giants won Game 3, 
forcing a fourth game of the NLDS, the Reds replaced Cueto on the playoff 
roster with Mike Leake, who was their fifth starter during the season and 
would go on to pitch the fourth game of the NLDS. Cueto finished fourth 
in the voting for the National League Cy Young, behind winner R.A. Dickey, 
Clayton Kershaw and Gio Gonzalez. Cueto suffered from a variety of injures 
in 2013, limiting him to only 11 starts on the season. In those 11 starts, 
Cueto had a record of 5–2 with a 2.82 ERA and 51 strikeouts over 60⅔ innings, 
holding opponents to a .209 batting average. He gave up no more than three 
earned runs in ten of his 11 starts, and no more than one earned run in 
eight of them. Despite his limited season, Cueto was chosen to start the 
2013 NL Wild Card Game against longtime division rival the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
Cueto was met by a raucous, loud Pittsburgh crowd who had not seen a playoff 
game in 20 years. The Pirates fans chanted Cue's name loudly the entire 
game, attempting to rattle him. After already giving up a second-inning 
home run to Pirates outfielder Marlon Byrd, Cueto, who was having his name 
mockingly chanted by over 40,000 people, dropped the ball off the mound, 
much to the delight of the Pittsburgh crowd. On the very next pitch he 
threw, Cueto gave up another home run to Pirates catcher Russell Martin, 
giving Pittsburgh an early 2–0 lead. Cueto would end up giving up 2 more 
runs, and was pulled after 3.1 innings, having already given up 4 earned 
runs on 8 hits. The Reds would show little resistance the rest of the way, 
and the Pirates won the game 6–2, advancing to an NLDS series with other 
division rival the St. Louis Cardinals. Cueto took the loss in the game, 
which ended the season for both Cueto and the Reds. After a disappointing 
finish to an injury-riddled 2013 season, Cueto opened the season in excellent 
fashion. In his first nine starts of the season, he pitched at least seven 
innings, giving up no more than two earned runs and five hits per outing. 
On April 16, Cueto threw a complete game, three-hit shutout versus the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, striking out a career-high 12 batters without issuing 
a single walk.[11] Cueto threw another complete game versus his Pirates 
in his next start on April 22,[12] followed by another shutout versus the 
Padres (his third complete game of the season) on May 15.[13] In his first 
fifteen starts of the season, despite compiling only a 6-5 win-loss record, 
Cueto had a 1.92 ERA across 108 innings, with 111 strikeouts against only 
26 walks, good for a WHIP of 0.83, while limiting opponents to a .169 batting 
average. In July Cueto was selected to his first All-Star Game.[14] At 
the time, Cueto was second in the NL in ERA (2.13) and strikeouts (141) 
and first in innings pitched (143⅔) and opponents batting average (.181).[11] 
Cueto was named National League Player of the Week for August 4–10 after 
recording a 2–0 record with a 2.12 ERA, and 15 strikeouts in 17.0 innings 
pitched.[15] After his first twenty-five starts, Cueto had a 14-6 record 
with a 2.05 ERA, having already established career highs in strikeouts, 
complete games and shutouts. On September 28, 2014, Cueto recorded his 
20th win of the 2014 season, becoming the first Cincinnati Reds player 
to achieve 20 or more victories in a season since Danny Jackson achieved 
the feat in 1988. The final score of the game, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
was 4–1. Cueto pitched a total of eight innings of one-run ball and was 
allowed to bat in the 8th inning instead of a pinch hitter, with the game 
tied 1–1 and a runner on third base. Cueto hit a go-ahead single and Aroldis 
Chapman picked up the save for the game in the 9th.[16] Cueto finished 
the 2014 season with a 20-9 record and a 2.25 ERA in 34 starts (29 quality 
starts), giving up only 169 hits and 22 home runs across 243⅔ innings pitched, 
recording 242 strikeouts (tied for the most in the NL with Stephen Strasburg) 
against just 65 walks, an opponent batting average of .194, an opponent 
on-base percentage of .261, an opponent slugging percentage of .313, an 
opponent on-base plus slugging of .584, and an 0.96 WHIP. He also pitched 
4 complete games (2 shutouts), never pitched less than 5 innings in any 
outing, pitched 6 or more innings in 29 of his 34 starts, 7 or more innings 
in 23 starts, and 8 or more innings in 15 starts. Cueto gave up 2 earned 
runs or fewer in 27 starts, gave up 7 hits or fewer in all but one of his 
starts, struck out 8.94 batters per nine innings, and gave up fewer hits 
per nine innings than any other starting pitcher in the majors (6.24 H/9). 
On November 12, 2014, Cueto finished second in the National League Cy Young 
Award voting to Clayton Kershaw.[17] On April 6, Cueto recorded the 1,000th 
strikeout of his career in a 5–2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Cueto 
finished his fourth consecutive Opening Day start with 10 strikeouts across 
7 scoreless innings, a personal Opening Day high.[18] Cueto struggled with 
inflammation in his elbow in May, but only missed a pair of starts and 
continued to assert himself as one of the top pitchers in baseball. At 
the end of June, Cueto had a 2.98 ERA and a 0.94 WHIP while limiting opponents 
to a .204 batting average. Cueto was a candidate for the Final Vote on 
the NL All-Star ballot, but lost to Carlos Martinez. On July 7, Cueto had 
his best outing of the year against the Nationals, throwing a complete 
game two-hit shutout, striking out 11 batters and walking only one. Despite 
Cueto's success, the Reds' continued to plummet in the NL Central, and 
ultimately chose to trade Cueto to the Royals days before the Trade Deadline. 
In 19 starts with the Reds, Cueto went 7-6 with a 2.62 ERA, striking out 
120 batters across 130⅔ innings (good for a K/9 ratio of 8.27), limiting 
opponents to a .196 batting average, and posting a WHIP of 0.93. On July 
26, 2015, Cueto was traded to the Kansas City Royals in exchange for Brandon 
Finnegan and minor leaguers John Lamb and Cody Reed.[19] In his home debut 
with the Royals, Cueto threw a 4-hit complete game shutout against the 
Detroit Tigers, striking out eight batters without issuing a walk. This 
gave him his first win in a Royals uniform. After a promising start, Cueto 
struggled down the stretch, posting a 4-7 record and a 4.76 ERA in 13 starts 
after joining the Royals. After a mediocre performance in game 2 of the 
American League Division Series against the Houston Astros, Cueto returned 
to form in game 5, pitching eight dominant innings, striking out 8 and 
retiring his final 19 batters. The only hits he allowed came on back-to-back 
pitches: an infield single by Evan Gattis and a home run by Luis Valbuena. 
The Royals went on to win 7–2, eliminating the Astros and securing a spot 
in the ALCS for the second straight season. In the ALCS against the Toronto 
Blue Jays,[20] Cueto took the loss in game 3 after giving up eight earned 
runs in two innings as the Royals' series lead shrunk from 2 games to 1.[21] 
Cueto started in game two of the World Series, pitched a complete game 
and only gave up two hits and one run to give the Royals a 7–1 victory 
over the New York Mets and a 2–0 series lead. Only Lucas Duda recorded 
a hit (with 2), becoming the difference maker between Cueto and a no-hitter.[22] 
Cueto became the first AL pitcher to throw a complete game in the World 
Series since Minnesota's Jack Morris in 1991.[23] The Royals went on to 
win the World Series in 5 games to give Cueto his first championship ring. 
In 32 starts between the Reds and Royals, Cueto went 11-13 with a 3.44 
ERA, striking out 176 batters across 212 innings, allowing just 194 hits 
and 46 walks, while pitching 2 complete game shutouts. On December 16, 
2015, Cueto signed a six-year, $130 million contract with the San Francisco 
Giants with a club option for 2022. Cueto can opt out of the contract after 
two years.[24] Slotting alongside longtime giant Madison Bumgarner and 
the acquisition of Jeff Samardzija, the Giants were predicted to be one 
of the strongest and most durable starting rotations in all of baseball 
heading into the 2016 season. Cueto made his Giants debut on April 5 against 
the Milwaukee Brewers, pitching seven innings of one-run ball. On April 
26 at AT&T Park, in a 1–0 complete game shutout over the San Diego Padres, 
his first with the Giants and the seventh of his career (thirteenth complete 
game), Cueto won his 100th career game on 119 pitches. He is the twelfth 
Dominican-born pitcher in Major League history to win one hundred games.[25] 
Cueto struck out 11 batters over the ball game, giving up just seven hits 
while issuing just one walk. Cueto threw his second complete game of the 
season, against the Padres at Petco Park on May 18, giving up just one 
run on four hits, striking out eight batters and walking just two. On May 
23, Cueto pitched another 1–0 complete game shutout, the fifteenth complete 
game and eighth shutout of his career, at home against the Padres, giving 
up just two hits and striking out six without issuing a walk.[26] Cueto 
was named National League Player of the Week for the second time in his 
career for May 23–29, going 2–0 with a 0.60 ERA (1 ER in 15.0 innings pitched), 
giving up just eight hits and striking out 11.[27] On July 6 Cueto was 
selected to his second All-Star game. At the time, Cueto had 12 wins against 
just one loss, having won nine straight decisions, compiling a 2.57 ERA 
across 122⅓ innings, and notching 107 strikeouts against just 23 walks, 
while giving up only six home runs.[28] In his final start before the All-Star 
break on July 6, Cueto threw another complete game, his fourth of the season, 
at home against the Colorado Rockies. He allowed just one run on five hits, 
walking only one batter and striking out eight, retiring 17 of the final 
18 batters he faced, his Major-League leading 13th win on the season. After 
making the All Star team, Cueto was selected by Manager Terry Collins to 
start the 2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game for the National League. 
He started with his battery mate, Buster Posey who was the starting catcher 
for the National League, but ended up receiving the loss, as the NL lost 
4-2.[29][30] Cueto struggled at first following the All-Star Break, posting 
an 0-2 record with a 4.84 ERA in his first six starts following the All-Star 
break. during which opposing hitters batted .284 against him and slugged 
six home runs, as many as he had given up before the All-Star break. Cueto 
won his first game since the All-Star break on August 19 against the Mets, 
pitching seven innings of one run ball to improve his record to 14-3. Across 
his final seven starts of the season following his first post All-Star 
win, Cueto went 4-2 with a 2.35 ERA, averaging a strikeout an inning and 
holding opposing batters to a .228 batting average. Cueto threw another 
complete game, his fifth of the year, against the St. Louis Cardinals on 
September 15, giving up one run while striking out seven batters, during 
which he surpassed 200 innings pitched for the fourth time in his career 
(and in the last five seasons). On September 20, during a start against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers, Cueto exited the game after 5⅓ scoreless innings 
due to a groin strain (he received the victory, allowing just eight hits 
and striking out six), causing him to miss his next start. Cueto finished 
the year on a high note on September 29 against the Colorado Rockies, in 
his final start of the regular season, pitching seven strong innings in 
which he gave up just two earned runs on nine hits and struck out 11 batters, 
as the Giants won the game 7-2. Thanks to Cueto's role as a co-ace alongside 
teammate and fellow NL All-Star Madison Bumgarner (the two pitchers combined 
for a 33-14 record with a 2.76 ERA across 446⅓ innings while tallying a 
total of 449 strikeouts), the Giants managed to clinch a Wild Card berth, 
where they defeated the New York Mets and advanced to the National League 
Division Series against the Chicago Cubs. In game 1 of the NLDS, in the 
midst of a duel with Cubs pitcher Jon Lester, after throwing 7⅓ scoreless 
innings, Cueto gave up a home run in the eighth inning to Javier Baez as 
San Francisco suffered a tough 1-0 loss to the Cubs. Despite that, Cueto 
still pitched a gem, allowing just three hits and the one run over eight 
innings in a complete game loss, striking out ten and not issuing a walk 
in an otherwise flawless performance as the Cubs took a 1-0 lead in the 
series. The Cubs would go on to win the series 3 games to 1, eliminating 
the Giants from the postseason. Cueto finished his first regular season 
with the Giants with an 18-5 record and a 2.79 ERA in 219⅔ innings across 
32 starts, tallying a total of 198 strikeouts against 45 walks while giving 
up 195 hits and 15 home runs. Cueto ranked among the league and baseball 
leaders in all major categories. He was third in the NL in wins (18), fifth 
in ERA (2.79), second in win percentage (.783%), third in innings pitched 
(219⅔), eighth in games started (32), first in complete games (5), second 
in shutouts (2), fifth in hits allowed (195), fourteenth in batting average 
against (.238), fourteenth in H/9 allowed (7.99), second in HR/9 allowed 
(0.61), eighth in WHIP (1.09), eighth in opponent OBP (.284), seventh in 
opponent SLG (.350), seventh in opponent OPS (.637), third in BB/9 allowed 
(1.84), sixth in strikeouts (198), twelfth in K/9 ratio (8.11), fifth in 
K/BB ratio (4.40), third in FIP (2.96), third in batters faced (881), fourth 
in quality starts (22), fourth in number of pitches thrown (3299) and second 
in number of batters picked off (5). Cueto was one of only six pitchers 
in the National League to pitch at least 200 innings during the 2016 season, 
and pitched more innings per game than any other qualified pitcher in the 
National League, averaging 6.865 innings pitched per start. Cueto pitched 
at least five innings in all but one start, at least six innings in 26 
starts, at least 6⅔ innings in 21 starts, at least 7 innings in 19 starts, 
at least 7⅓ innings in nine starts and at least 8 innings in seven starts. 
Cueto also recorded three (four counting his only postseason start) double 
digit strikeout games (11 vs. the Padres (4/26) and the Rockies (9/29) 
and 10 vs. the Phillies (8/3)), recorded at least 9 strikeouts in seven 
starts, at least 8 strikeouts in 12 starts, at least 7 strikeouts in 14 
starts, at least 6 strikeouts in 19 starts and at least 5 strikeouts in 
23 starts. Cueto's road to the Major League was a trying one because many 
teams were wary of his small stature. "Some told me I was too short, others 
thought I was in fact older than the age that appeared in my papers", said 
the right-handed fireballer. He is listed at 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m), 
but some believe he is closer to 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 m). However, rather 
than give in to the criticism, Cueto looked to another undersized Dominican 
pitcher, Pedro Martínez, for inspiration. "Pedro has been my inspiration, 
the person for whom I decided to stop playing outfield to become a pitcher", 
Cueto said. "One of my biggest dreams is to be able to meet Pedro in person, 
shake his hand and tell him that he has been my hero and my role model."[31] 
Cueto throws a variety of pitches, although his main ones are a four-seam 
fastball (91–95 m.p.h.), a two-seam fastball (92–95 m.p.h.), and a slider 
(81–86 m.p.h.). He also has a changeup (82–84 m.p.h.), a curveball (78–80 
m.p.h.), and a cutter (87–90 m.p.h.). Cueto only throws his changeup to 
left-handed hitters, and he rarely uses his curveball. He often likes to 
use his slider with two strikes.[32] Cueto's distinctive wind-up, which 
begins by spinning back towards second base so that his back faces the 
batter, has been compared to that of Luis Tiant and Hideo Nomo.[33] Cueto's 
unorthodox delivery led Detroit Tigers manager Brad Ausmus to question 
its legality during and after Cueto's shutout of the Tigers in August 2015. 
Ausmus argued to umpire Joe West during the game and to reporters after 
the game that Cueto sometimes stops in his wind-up, thereby making those 
pitches illegal.[34] Cueto was a member of the Dominican Republic national
