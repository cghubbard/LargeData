Carey Schueler (born c.1974) is the daughter of former Chicago White Sox 
General Manager Ron Schueler. She was the first woman ever drafted by a 
Major League Baseball team when the White Sox picked the 18-year-old left-handed 
pitcher in the 43rd round (1208th pick overall) of the 1993 MLB draft.[1] 
Up until that time she had been a basketball star at Campolindo High School 
in Moraga, California.[2] She attended and played basketball for DePaul 
University in Chicago, Illinois before transferring to St. Mary's College 
of California, back in Moraga,[3] where she continued to play until an 
injury in 1996.[4] In 2002, Schueler was rumored to be a contestant for 
Survivor: Thailand. Despite the rumors, she never appeared on the show.[5]
