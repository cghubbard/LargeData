Robert Pershing "Bobby" Doerr (born April 7, 1918) is a former Major League 
Baseball (MLB) second baseman and coach. He played his entire 14-year baseball 
career for the Boston Red Sox (1937–51). Doerr achieved a batting average 
over .300 in several seasons. He set Red Sox team records in several statistical 
categories. Doerr missed one season due to military service during World 
War II. He is a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Doerr served as a 
scout and a coach in professional baseball after he retired as a player. 
He worked with Carl Yastrzemski before the Red Sox player's Triple Crown 
season. As of November 4th 2016, Doerr is the oldest living former major 
league player. He is also the last living person who played in the major 
leagues in the 1930s.[1] Doerr was born the son of Harold Doerr, a telephone 
company supervisor, and his wife, the former Frances Herrnberger; his middle 
name was a tribute to General John J. Pershing, then the commander of U.S. 
military forces in World War I.[2] He graduated from Los Angeles' Fremont 
High School in 1936. He had already begun his professional career with 
the 1934 and 1935 Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League (PCL).[3] 
While playing for the San Diego Padres of the PCL in 1936, Doerr met Ted 
Williams. The future Red Sox teammates became close friends for many years.[4] 
Doerr played in 175 games for San Diego that year, batting .342. He recorded 
238 hits, including 37 doubles and 12 triples.[3] Doerr broke into the 
majors in 1937 at the age of 19 and went 3 for 5 in his first game. In 
1938 he became a regular in a powerful Red Sox lineup that included Jimmie 
Foxx, Joe Cronin, and Dom DiMaggio. Early in his career Doerr was often 
called upon to bunt and was so proficient at it that he led the league 
with 22 sacrifice hits in 1938. In 1939, Ted Williams' rookie season with 
the Sox, Doerr began a string of 12 consecutive seasons with 10 or more 
home runs and 73 or more runs batted in; in 1940 the Red Sox became the 
12th team in major league history to have four players with 100 RBI, with 
Foxx, Williams, Cronin and Doerr each collecting at least 105. In 1944 
Doerr led the league in slugging percentage. The same year, his .325 batting 
average was good enough to allow him to finish second in the league, two 
percentage points behind Lou Boudreau of the Cleveland Indians. He was 
named the AL's Most Valuable Player by The Sporting News, although he finished 
only seventh in voting for the AL MVP Award, being named on only 13 of 
24 ballots and receiving nothing higher than a third-place vote. Doerr 
hit for the cycle twice in his career, on May 17, 1944 in a 12–8 loss to 
the St. Louis Browns in the second game of a doubleheader, and again on 
May 13, 1947 in a 19–16 win over the Chicago White Sox. Doerr missed the 
1945 season while serving in the Army during World War II, being stationed 
at Camp Roberts, California. In 1946, Doerr finished third in the MVP vote 
(won by Williams) as Boston won their first pennant since 1918. Doerr drove 
in 116 runs despite a .271 average. He hit .409 in the 1946 World Series 
loss to the St. Louis Cardinals, with a home run and three runs batted 
in. Williams referred to Doerr as "the silent captain of the Red Sox."[5] 
Doerr's average dropped to .258 in 1947 as he grounded into a league-high 
25 double plays, but he had 95 runs batted in (RBI). He hit .285 with 27 
home runs and 111 RBI in 1948.[6] Doerr had set an American League record 
in that year by handling 414 chances in a row over 73 games without an 
error. In 1949, he hit .309 with 18 home runs and 109 RBI.[6] At the start 
of the 1950 season, Doerr was in a slump; he was only batting .232 as of 
June 2.[7] However, he finished the year with a league-leading 11 triples. 
On June 8 of that year, he hit three home runs in a 29–4 romp over the 
Browns. He set career highs that year in triples, runs (103) and RBI (120); 
he tied his career high in home runs (27).[6] Doerr appeared in only 106 
games in 1951 and he retired that September after suffering from a spinal 
problem for two years.[8] Doerr retired with 8,028 plate appearances, 1,094 
runs, 89 triples, 809 walks, 1,349 singles, 1,184 runs created, 693 extra 
base hits, 2,862 times on base, 115 sacrifice hits and nine All-Star Game 
selections. At Fenway Park, he hit .315 with 145 home runs, compared to 
a .261 average and 78 HR on the road. Doerr batted over .300 three times, 
with six seasons of at least 100 runs batted in. He never played a game 
at a position other than second base.[6] Regarded as one of the top defensive 
second basemen of his era, Doerr led American League (AL) second basemen 
in double plays five times, tying a league record, in putouts and fielding 
percentage four times each, and in assists three times. Doerr held the 
major league record for career double plays at second base (1,507) until 
1963, and his career fielding percentage (.980) was a major league record 
until 1953. Doerr also ended his career ranking fifth in career games (1,852), 
putouts (4,928) and total chances (10,852) at second base, and sixth in 
assists (5,710). He set Red Sox records for career games (1,865), at bats 
(7,093), hits (2,042), doubles (381), total bases (3,270) and runs batted 
in (1,247),[9] All of Doerr's offensive Red Sox records were later broken 
by Williams. His 223 home runs were then the third most by a major league 
second baseman, with his 1,247 RBI ranking fifth in Red Sox history. After 
spending a few years as a cattle rancher in Oregon, Doerr returned to baseball.[10] 
He became a scout for the Red Sox from 1957 to 1966, also serving as a 
minor league hitting instructor for the team for the last six seasons of 
that span. He was hired as the first base coach for the Red Sox in 1967 
under new manager Dick Williams.[11] The Red Sox won their first pennant 
in 20 years and played in the 1967 World Series. As Boston's unofficial 
batting instructor that year, Doerr worked with Carl Yastrzemski to convert 
the seven-year veteran from an opposite-field "doubles" hitter who had 
never before hit more than 20 homers in a season to a pull-hitting slugger 
who belted 44 home runs and won the Triple Crown and AL Most Valuable Player 
award that season. Doerr resigned from the Red Sox when Williams was fired 
as manager in September 1969. He became the hitting coach for the expansion 
Toronto Blue Jays from 1977 to 1981. Doerr has lived in Oregon since the 
late 1930s, residing in the vicinity of Agness for much of his career before 
relocating to Junction City in the 1950s. Doerr was married to Monica Terpin 
from October 1938 until her death in 2003; she had lived with multiple 
sclerosis since the 1940s. They had one son.[10] He was inducted into the 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986. His jersey number 1 was retired by the Red 
Sox on May 21, 1988. He made annual trips to the Hall of Fame induction 
at Cooperstown, New York until 2008, after which he stopped attending. 
On July 29, 2007, the Hall of Fame honored Doerr after the induction of 
Cal Ripken, Jr. and Tony Gwynn into the Hall. Reflecting on being inducted 
into the Hall of Fame and having his number retired by the Red Sox, Doerr 
said, "If I had played on a world champion, that would have made my life 
complete."[10] On August 2, 2007, the Red Sox held "Bobby Doerr Day" at 
Fenway Park where he rode along the warning track in a car, threw out the 
first pitch, and gave a speech. Upon the death of former New York Yankees 
executive and American League president Lee MacPhail in November 2012, 
Doerr became the oldest living member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Doerr 
is also the last man alive who played in the major leagues during the 1930s. 
Doerr had what was characterized as a minor stroke on August 11, 2011.[12] 
He attended the Fenway Park 100th anniversary celebration on April 20, 
2012.[13] Upon the death of Lou Lucier in October 2014, Doerr became the 
oldest living former Red Sox player.[14] On November 4, 2016, Doerr became
