Howard Bruce Sutter (/ˈsuːtər/; born January 8, 1953) is a former Major 
League Baseball right-handed relief pitcher. He was arguably the first 
pitcher to make effective use of the split-finger fastball. One of the 
sport's dominant relievers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he became 
the only pitcher to lead the National League in saves five times (1979–1982, 
1984). In 1979, Sutter won the NL's Cy Young Award as the league's top 
pitcher. Born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Sutter briefly attended Old Dominion 
University and was subsequently signed by the Chicago Cubs as an undrafted 
free agent in 1971. Between 1976 and 1988, he played for the Cubs, St. 
Louis Cardinals and Atlanta Braves. In the mid-1980s, Sutter began to experience 
shoulder problems, undergoing three surgeries and retiring in 1989. Sutter 
was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown in 2006, his 
13th year of eligibility. He was the fourth relief pitcher to be inducted. 
He was also selected to the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in 2014. He 
was hired by the Philadelphia Phillies as a minor league consultant. Sutter 
was born to Howard and Thelma Sutter in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. His father 
managed a Farm Bureau warehouse in Mount Joy, Pennsylvania.[1] Bruce was 
the fifth child of six.[2] Sutter graduated from Donegal High School in 
Mount Joy, where he played baseball, football and basketball. He was quarterback 
and captain of the football team and also served as captain for the basketball 
squad, which won a district championship in his senior season. His baseball 
team also won the county championship.[2] After being selected by the Washington 
Senators in the 21st round of the June 1970 draft, Sutter instead attended 
Old Dominion University before signing with the Cubs as a free agent in 
September 1971. He pitched in two games for the Gulf Coast League Cubs 
in 1972.[3] When he was 19, Sutter had surgery on his arm to relieve a 
pinched nerve.[4] When he recovered from surgery and returned to the mound 
a year later, Sutter found that his previous pitches were no longer effective. 
He learned the split-finger fastball from minor league pitching instructor 
Fred Martin. Sutter's large hands helped him to use the pitch, which was 
a modification of the forkball.[4] Sutter had nearly been released by the 
Cubs, but found success with the new pitch. Mike Krukow, who was also a 
Cubs minor league player at the time, said, "As soon as I saw him throw 
it, I knew he was going to the big leagues. Everyone wanted to throw it 
after he did."[5] He recorded a 3-3 win-loss record, a 4.13 ERA and five 
saves in 40 games in Class A baseball in 1973.[3] Sutter split the 1974 
season between the Class A Key West Conchs and the Class AA Midland Cubs. 
Though he finished the season with a combined 2-7 record, he recorded a 
1.38 ERA in 65 innings. He returned to Midland in 1975 and finished the 
year with a 5-7 record, a 2.15 ERA and 13 saves.[3] Sutter led the team 
in ERA and saves as they won the Texas League West Division pennant.[6] 
He started the 1976 season with the Class AAA Wichita Aeros, but he pitched 
only seven games with the team before being promoted to the major leagues.[3] 
Sutter joined the Cubs in May 1976. He pitched in 52 games and finished 
with a 6-3 win-loss record and 10 saves. In 1977 he had a 1.34 ERA, earned 
an All-Star Game selection, and finished sixth and seventh in NL Cy Young 
Award and MVP Award voting, respectively.[7] On September 8, 1977, Sutter 
struck out three batters on nine pitches — Ellis Valentine, Gary Carter 
and Larry Parrish — in the ninth inning of a 10-inning 3-2 win over the 
Montreal Expos. Sutter became the 12th NL pitcher and the 19th pitcher 
in MLB history to accomplish the nine-strike/three-strikeout half-inning. 
Sutter had also struck out the side (though not on nine pitches) upon entering 
the game in the eighth inning, giving him six consecutive strikeouts, tying 
the NL record for a reliever. Sutter's ERA increased to 3.19 in 1978, but 
he earned 27 saves.[7] In May 1979, the Cubs acquired relief pitcher Dick 
Tidrow. Tidrow would enter the game and pitch a couple of innings before 
Sutter came in for the save. Sutter credited Tidrow for much of his success.[8] 
Sutter saved 37 games for the club, tying the NL record held by Clay Carroll 
(1972) and Rollie Fingers (1978), and won the NL Cy Young Award. This year 
also marked the first of five seasons (four consecutive) in which he led 
the league in saves. Sutter also won the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year 
Award and The Sporting News Fireman of the Year Award. In addition to a 
league-leading 28 saves in 1980, Sutter recorded a 2.64 ERA and finished 
with a 5-8 win-loss record in 60 games. His strikeout total, which had 
been over 100 the previous three seasons, fell to 76 that year and he never 
finished with more than 77 strikeouts in any of his remaining seasons.[7] 
Sutter was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Leon Durham, Ken Reitz 
and a player to be named later in December 1980. He made his fifth consecutive 
All-Star Game in 1981.[7] He recorded 25 saves, registered a 2.62 ERA and 
finished fifth in the NL Cy Young Award voting.[7] Sutter registered 36 
saves in 1982, finishing third in the Cy Young Award voting.[7] The Cardinals 
won the 1982 World Series and Sutter is credited with two saves in that 
Series, including the Series-clinching save in Game 7 which ended with 
a strikeout of Gorman Thomas. He received a leaping hug after that game 
by catcher and World Series MVP Darrell Porter. Sutter also earned the 
save in the pennant-clinching victory in the NLCS. In 1983, Sutter recorded 
a 9-10 win-loss record and a 4.23 ERA; his save total declined to 21.[7] 
In April of that year, Sutter executed a rare unassisted pickoff play. 
Bill Madlock of the Pittsburgh Pirates had reached first base safely and 
took a long lead off of the base during the next at bat. Madlock became 
distracted by Cardinals first baseman Keith Hernandez and Sutter ran off 
the mound to tag Madlock out.[9] Sutter, who won both the Rolaids Relief 
Man of the Year Award and The Sporting News Reliever of the Year Award 
again in 1981, 1982 and 1984, tied Dan Quisenberry's major league record 
for most saves in a season (45) in 1984. (His MLB record was broken by 
Dave Righetti (46) in 1986 and his NL record was broken by Lee Smith (47) 
in 1991.) During Sutter's record-breaking season, he pitched a career-high 
122 2⁄3 innings. It was one of five seasons in which Sutter threw more 
than 100 innings.[10] Sutter joined the Atlanta Braves in December 1984 
as a free agent. The New York Times reported that Sutter's six-year contract 
paid him $4.8 million and placed another $4.8 million into a deferred payment 
account at 13 percent interest. The newspaper estimated that the account 
would pay Sutter $1.3 million per year for 30 years after the initial six 
seasons of the contract. Sutter said that he was attracted to the Braves 
because of Atlanta's scenery and his respect for Ted Turner and Dale Murphy.[11] 
Before the start of the 1985 season, Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog commented 
on facing the season without Sutter. "To me, Bruce is the best there ever 
was", Herzog said. "Losing him is like Kansas City losing Dan Quisenberry... 
I told Bruce, 'Look, you've taken care of your children and your grandchildren 
and your great-grandchildren. Now, if I get fired in July, will you take 
care of me and Mary Lou?'"[12] When Sutter arrived in Atlanta, only two 
pitchers had ever earned 25 or more saves in a season and the 1984 Braves 
recorded 49 saves as a team, four more than Sutter's previous single-season 
total.[13] In 1985, Sutter's ERA rose to 4.48 and his saves total decreased 
to 23.[7] By the end of the season, he was first bothered by nerve impingement 
in the right shoulder.[14] He underwent surgery on the shoulder after the 
season, but he recovered in time to appear in spring training in mid-March 
1986.[15] Near the end of March 1986, Sutter commented on his recovery, 
saying, "I'm throwing the ball as hard as I ever have, but it's just not 
getting there as fast. I don't know what's going to happen. I just have 
to keep throwing and see. So far, there have been no setbacks. Today I 
felt great, no problems."[16] Sutter started the season with a 2-0 record 
and a 4.34 ERA in 16 games.[7] He was placed on the disabled list (DL) 
in May due to arm problems. On July 31, manager Chuck Tanner announced 
that Sutter would probably not return to pitching in that season.[17] Sutter 
underwent shoulder surgery in February 1987, the third procedure performed 
on his arm, in an attempt to remove scar tissue and to promote nerve healing. 
To recover from the surgery, he was required to miss the entire 1987 season.[18] 
He returned to action with the Braves on a limited basis in 1988.[2] In 
late May, Sutter earned saves on consecutive nights and sportswriter Jerome 
Holtzman characterized his pitching as "vintage Sutter."[19] He finished 
the year with a 1-4 record, a 4.76 ERA and 14 saves in 38 games pitched.[7] 
In late September, he had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee.[20] By 
March 1989, Sutter was dealing with a severely torn rotator cuff and he 
admitted that he would be unlikely to return to baseball. "There's probably 
a 99.9 percent chance I won't be able to pitch again", he said.[21] General 
Manager Bobby Cox said that "Bruce is not going to retire. We're not going 
to release him. We'll put him on the 21-day disabled list, then probably 
move him to the 60-day DL later on."[21] Sutter planned to reevaluate his 
condition after resting his arm for three to four months.[21] The Braves 
released him that November.[22] He retired with exactly 300 saves – at 
the time, the third highest total in history behind Rollie Fingers (341) 
and Rich "Goose" Gossage (302). His career saves total was an NL record 
until broken by Lee Smith in 1993; Sutter had set the NL record in 1982 
with his 194th save, surpassing the mark held by Roy Face. In his first 
nine seasons, only Kent Tekulve made more appearances, and he saved 133 
of the Cubs' 379 wins between 1976 and 1980. Sutter appeared on his thirteenth 
Baseball Hall of Fame ballot in 2006. Sportswriter Matthew Leach of MLB.com 
referred to this ballot as Sutter's best chance for induction; he pointed 
out that Sutter would only be eligible for two more Hall of Fame ballots. 
Nearing the end of his eligibility, Sutter said he did not think about 
induction very often. "It's just an honor to be on the ballot, but it's 
not something I think that much about. I have no control over it. ... It's 
out of my hands. It's the voters, it's in the voters' hands. There's nothing 
I can do about it. I can't pitch anymore... There's a lot of guys that 
I think should be in that aren't in. It's for the special few people to 
get into the Hall of Fame. It shouldn't be easy to get in", he said.[23] 
On January 10, 2006, Sutter was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 
his 13th year of eligibility by receiving 400 votes out of a possible 520, 
or 76.9%. He was the fourth relief pitcher inducted, the first pitcher 
inducted without starting a game[24] and the first inductee to end his 
career with fewer than 1700 innings pitched. He is also one of three pitchers 
in the Hall of Fame to be inducted with a losing record (Rollie Fingers 
and Satchel Paige being the others). Before Sutter, Ralph Kiner (1975) 
was the last player elected to the Hall of Fame by the BBWAA so late in 
their eligibility period; Kiner was elected in his 15th and final opportunity. 
MLB.com columnist Mike Bauman attributed the delay in Sutter's Hall of 
Fame election to several factors. He pointed out that Sutter's first five 
strong seasons were with the Cubs, a team that did not receive much attention 
during those years. He also noted that the closer role was relatively new 
in baseball history. Finally, he wrote that Sutter's candidacy was hurt 
by the fact that his career was cut short following injuries.[25] At Sutter's 
Hall of Fame induction that July, Sutter was the only former MLB player 
inducted. However, he was joined by 17 Negro league baseball personalities. 
During his induction speech, Sutter said, "I haven't played baseball for 
18 years now and I'm getting more sentimental as I get older. You start 
losing family members and you start losing friends. There are teammates 
who have passed on. You start thinking of them as you put together a speech. 
I'm not usually an emotional guy. My kids said the first time they ever 
saw me cry was when I got that phone call [telling him that he was elected]. 
Now today. I guess a lot of people have seen me crying now."[26] Johnny 
Bench and Ozzie Smith wore decorative beards to the induction speech in 
honor of Sutter.[26] Sutter's Hall of Fame plaque depicts his wearing a 
Cardinals cap,[27] although the Hall considers his "primary team" (the 
team he represents as a Hall of Fame member) to be the Cubs. Sutter's number 
42, which he wore throughout his career, was retired by the St. Louis Cardinals 
during a ceremony at Busch Stadium on September 17, 2006. He shares his 
retired number with Jackie Robinson, whose number 42 was retired by all 
MLB teams in 1997.[28] In November 2010, Sutter was inducted into the St. 
Louis Sports Hall of Fame. Herzog accepted the induction in place of Sutter 
at a luncheon a few months later. Sutter was unable to attend the events 
because his wife was hospitalized with cancer.[29] In January 2014, the 
Cardinals announced Sutter among 22 former players and personnel to be 
inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural 
class of 2014.[30] Sutter remained in Atlanta with his wife and three sons 
after retirement. His son Chad was a catcher who played for Tulane University 
and was selected by the New York Yankees in the 23rd round (711th overall) 
of the 1999 amateur draft. Chad played one season in the minor leagues 
and later joined the coaching staff of the Tulane baseball team.[31] On 
August 23, 2010, he was named a minor league consultant for the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[32] He was hired to evaluate pitching prospects at the team's
