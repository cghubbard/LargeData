The Lehigh Mountain Hawks are the athletic teams representing Lehigh University 
in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States. The Hawks participate in NCAA 
Division I competition as a member of the Patriot League. In football, 
Lehigh competes in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), 
still frequently known by its former designation of Division I-AA.. The 
athletic teams of Lehigh (founded in 1865) were known as the Engineers 
until the 1995â€“96 academic year. Some believe that this nickname was a 
reference to the Lehigh Valley Railroad,[1] not to the school's academic 
engineering program.[2] However, there was also a logo of a giant Lehigh 
Engineer looking through a surveyor's transit while an airliner flew over 
him and a diesel passenger train steamed beneath his feet in use at Lehigh 
during the 1950s and 60s. As the university expanded following the advent 
of coeducation in 1971, while the number of engineering students remained 
steady, the percentage of students enrolled in engineering declined from 
50% to about 30%. As a result, during the school's 1988 appearance in the 
men's NCAA basketball tournament, TV commentators were encouraged to refer 
to the school by its colors, Brown and White. Beginning in the 1980s and 
until 1995, the team used a logo of a train locomotive with an "L" on the 
front. In November 1995, the school introduced the Mountain Hawk as a mascot, 
replacing the "L train", which stemmed from a popular, student-based movement 
to come up with a suitable mascot; the Mountain Hawk was officially voted 
in as the new mascot by the Lehigh Student Senate soon after.[3] Controversy 
arose the following year, when the school's nickname was changed to the 
Mountain Hawks. Many alumni and students, including various members of 
Lehigh's Marching 97, still object, though the school's athletes were cited 
as being strong supporters of this change.[4] The school still lists all 
three nicknames (Engineers, Brown & White, and Mountain Hawks) in its media 
guides. In November 2008, just before the 144th game against Lafayette, 
the mascot was given the name "Clutch." The name was chosen after a long 
contest of name suggestions and voting. Lehigh is especially known for 
its football rivalry with Lafayette College, the most frequently-played 
matchup in college football history. Lehigh has very successful programs 
in both baseball (men) and softball (women), having won both Patriot League 
titles in 2015 and advancing to the NCAA playoffs. Lehigh is also competitive 
in men's and women's basketball. Both teams play in Stabler Arena. The 
men's and women's teams both won the Patriot League championship in 2010. 
The Men's team went on to the NCAA Tournament, losing in the first round 
to top-ranked University of Kansas. The Mountain Hawks men's basketball 
team is best known for its first-round game in the 2012 NCAA Men's Division 
I Basketball Tournament as a #15 seed on March 16, 2012 against the #2 
seed Duke Blue Devils. Despite being a heavy underdog, thanks to C. J. 
McCollum's 30-point heroics, the Mountain Hawks pulled off the stunning 
upset, defeating the Blue Devils 75-70 and making it only the sixth time 
that a 15th seed has defeated a 2nd seed.[5] The varsity football team 
competes at the Division I FCS level. Lehigh is a highly respected FCS 
program with a rich tradition. Lehigh won the 1977 Division II National 
Championship by defeating Jacksonville State 33-0 in the Pioneer Bowl. 
The Engineers were 1979 1-AA National Runners-up after falling to Eastern 
Kentucky in the title game. Lehigh has ten Patriot League championships, 
which is the most amongst league members. The program has also enjoyed 
seven FCS playoff appearances: 1980, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2010 
and 2011.[6] Lehigh is also part of the most played rivalry in college 
football. The Mountain Hawks have met the Lafayette Leopards 150 times. 
Lafayette leads the all-time series 78-67-5.[7] The game is traditionally 
played on the Saturday before Thanksgiving. Football games are well-attended 
at Lehigh's Goodman Stadium which has been voted the best place to watch 
a Patriot League football game for the past six years.[8] Tailgate parties 
are a big part of the experience, attracting many students and alumni who 
attend the games. See also, Lehigh Mountain Hawks men's lacrosse Lehigh's 
lacrosse team competes in the nine-team Patriot League. The Mountain Hawks 
have a strong tradition in lacrosse, but have only appeared twice (2012, 
2013) in the present NCAA championships since its formation in 1971. Lehigh 
has accumulated seven national lacrosse titles under the former USILA national 
title format and strongly contributed to the growth of lacrosse in Pennsylvania. 
Both the men's and women's soccer teams are highly competitive. The 2006 
Men's team had a 15-2-3 overall record and became the first Patriot League 
team to go a perfect 7-0 in league play. They advanced to the third round 
of the NCAA play-offs before losing to the number-one seed. The women's 
team was Patriot League co-champion in 2005 and is coached by Manny Oudin. 
Lehigh's wrestling team competes in the EIWA (The Patriot League does not 
sponsor wrestling). Lehigh has a strong tradition in wrestling dating back 
to 1910, and often wins the league and places in the top 10 at the NCAA 
National Championships. Lehigh is considered one of the best private schools 
in the country for wrestling, having had 27 National NCAA individual champions, 
136 NCAA All-Americans, 16 top five NCAA team finishes, 34-time EIWA Champions, 
and 203 individual EIWA Champions.[9] Its last national champion was Zack 
Rey. Lehigh alumni coach wrestling at many institutions, including Jason 
Kutz (1998), head wrestling coach at East Stroudsburg University; Chris 
Ayres (1999), head wrestling coach at Princeton University; Cory Cooperman 
(2006), assistant wrestling coach at Rutgers University; Troy Letters (2006), 
and Derek Zinck (2006), assistant wrestling coaches at Princeton University. 
In 2006, the wrestling team marked its fifth straight EIWA championship. 
The current head coach is Pat Santoro and the team's home Leeman-Turner 
Arena at Grace Hall, often referred to as "The Snakepit", with a capacity 
of 2,200.[10] Bobby Weaver is a former Engineer wrestler who won a gold
