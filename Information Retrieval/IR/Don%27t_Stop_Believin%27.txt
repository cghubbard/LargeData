"Don't Stop Believin'" is a song by the American rock band Journey, originally 
released as a single from its seventh studio album Escape (1981). It became 
a number 9 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 on its original release. In the 
United Kingdom, the song was not a Top 40 hit on its original release; 
however, it reached sixth with a 2009 re-release after it had increased 
its popularity from its use on television. Mike DeGagne of AllMusic has 
described "Don't Stop Believin'" as a "perfect rock song"[2] and an "anthem", 
featuring "one of the best opening keyboard riffs in rock."[3] It is one 
of the top-selling catalog tracks in digital history.[4] While most popular 
songs have a refrain that is repeated several times throughout the song, 
the true chorus to "Don't Stop Believin'" (as well as first mention of 
its title) is not heard until the end of the song, with only 0:50 left. 
The song's writers designated the musically similar sections before the 
chorus as the "pre-chorus."[5] The song's structure is: The song is played 
in the key of E major at a tempo of 118 beats per minute. The vocal range 
is E3–C#5.[6] The chord progression, played by the piano in the introduction 
and continued throughout most of the song, is eight chords long, following 
a I-V-vi-IV-I-V-iii-IV progression. While the lyrics mention being "born 
and raised in south Detroit", the area that would be considered south Detroit 
is actually the Canadian city of Windsor.[7] Steve Perry has said, "I tried 
north Detroit, I tried east and west and it didn't sing, but south Detroit 
sounded so beautiful. I loved the way it sounded, only to find out later 
it's actually Canada."[7] In 2007, the song gained press coverage and a 
sharp growth in popularity for its use in the famous final scene of HBO's 
The Sopranos series finale "Made in America." Steve Perry was initially 
hesitant to allow the song to be used in The Sopranos but later agreed.[8] 
Digital downloads of the song soared following the episode's airing and 
the exposure motivated the band members to overcome the struggles they 
were having at the time and find a replacement lead singer after Perry's 
departure.[9][10] The song was released as downloadable content for the 
music video game series Rock Band on March 31, 2009.[11] The song is referred 
to in the chorus of the song "This'll Be My Year" performed by Train on 
their album California 37, in which Pat Monahan sings "I stopped believin', 
although Journey told me 'don't'".[12][13] The song has been a rallying 
cry for a multitude of sports teams, first by the Chicago White Sox in 
their successful run to the 2005 World Series, when catcher A. J. Pierzynski 
and teammates heard the song being sung in a bar in Baltimore. The White 
Sox invited Journey lead singer Steve Perry to the team's celebration rally, 
where he sang the song along with several members of the team. In 2008, 
in a tight battle for first place with the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 
National League West, the Los Angeles Dodgers began to play "Don't Stop 
Believin'" in the middle of the 8th inning at all of their home games.[14] 
Subsequently, the song was played at Dodger home games throughout the 2009 
season, much to the chagrin of Perry, a self-proclaimed San Francisco Giants 
fan.[14] The song also became the unofficial anthem for the Giants' 2010 
postseason, especially after local musician Ashkon created a parody version 
of the song following their winning the 2010 National League West Division.[15] 
The song was used during the end montage following the Fox network's coverage 
of the 2010 World Series, which was won by the Giants. Perry appeared in 
the Giants' subsequent victory parade,[16] and the song was played at the 
start of the Giants' victory rally.[17] Perry has appeared at several Giants 
home games at AT&T Park during the 2014 postseason, leading the crowd in 
singing "Don't Stop Believin'" during the "8th inning sing-along" when 
the Giants are tied or behind in the score; when the Giants are ahead the 
crowd sings "Lights" instead.[18] The song has for years been commonly 
played at Detroit Red Wings hockey games; at Red Wings home games (especially 
during the last minutes of playoff victories), the recording is turned 
down during the line "born and raised in south Detroit" so the home fans 
can sing the line from the song.[19][20] It is also used at numerous Detroit 
sporting events.[21] Prior to the beginning of the 2014 season Mississippi 
State Head Football Coach Dan Mullen asked the DJ at Davis Wade Stadium 
to play "Don't Stop Believin" between the third and fourth quarters of 
each Bulldog home game. MSU fans immediately took to the song and began 
to sway and ring the cowbells that they traditionally bring to home games 
in sync with the beat while singing along.[22][23][24][25] "Oh, man. I 
love that song," said MSU defensive end Preston Smith. "When it comes on, 
it gets the whole stadium going. It's a great energy, I love it. I think 
I was out there in the Auburn game doing a drum solo."[26] The song reached 
number eight on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, and number nine on the 
Billboard Hot 100 chart. It sold over a million copies in vinyl.[4] It 
topped downloads in the iTunes Music Store amongst songs not released in 
the 21st century,[27] and was also the 72nd most downloaded song of 2008, 
and 84th most downloaded song of 2009 in the store, over 27 years after 
its release. On 31 August 2009 the song topped the 3 million mark in paid 
downloads.[28] It is the best-selling digital song from a pre-digital-era,[29] 
and it was also the best-selling rock song in digital history until it 
was over taken by Imagine Dragons' "Radioactive" in January 2014.[4] It 
was placed just outside the top twenty best selling digital songs of all 
time in September 2010.[30] It has sold over 6.8 million digital units 
in the US as of September 2016[31] and is the best selling digital track 
recorded in the 1980s. "Don't Stop Believin'" has entered other charts 
across the world in recent years, following a gain in popularity. In Canada 
the song peaked at number 2, at number 4 in Ireland, at 25 in Sweden after 
many chart runs, and at number 50 in the Dutch charts. The song is one 
of the most popular rock tracks in Ireland and continues to remain in the 
top ten most downloaded songs.[32] The song was released in the United 
Kingdom in December 1981[1] and peaked only at number 62. "Don't Stop Believin'", 
never re-released in the UK, retained a cult following and re-entered the 
UK Singles Chart in February 2009 at number 94, due to digital downloads. 
On November 1, 2009, following a performance on The X Factor, "Don't Stop 
Believin'" re-entered the chart at number 52, and it rose to number 19 
a week later. The song stayed in the charts for three weeks, before dropping 
out of the top 40. On December 20 that year, "Don't Stop Believin'" re-entered 
the chart at number 9 after the song was performed again on The X Factor. 
The song remained in the top 10 for another seven weeks in 2010, hitting 
a peak of number 6 in the process. In early 2010, it was announced that 
the song had been the 65th best-selling single of 2009. "Don't Stop Believin'" 
spent a total of 21 non-consecutive weeks in the top 40 during its November 
2009 – April 2010 run. "Don't Stop Believin'" was the 25th best-selling 
track of 2010, selling just over 435,000 copies. It re-entered the charts 
in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and to date has spent 95 weeks in the top 100.[33] 
In September 2014, the Official Charts Company listed the song as having 
sold a Million copies in the UK.[34] *sales figures based on certification 
alone ^shipments figures based on certification alone In December 2010, 
The Key of Awesome had sampled the chorus of "Don't Stop Believin'", as 
part of their Black Eyed Peas spoof.[47] However, in October 2011, the 
members of Journey had the original video taken down due to the copyright 
infringements.[48][49] The Finnish symphonic metal band Northern Kings 
covers the song on their album Reborn. The 2007 "covers" album Guilt by 
Association Vol. 1 contains an a cappella version of "Don't Stop Believin'" 
by Petra Haden (member of That Dog and daughter of jazz bassist Charlie 
Haden) recorded via multiple vocal overdubs. Alvin and the Chipmunks recorded 
a cover version for their 2008 album Undeniable.[50] Glam metal band Steel 
Panther released a cover version as a non-album single in 2009. In 2009, 
Joe McElderry performed the song on the 6th UK series of The X Factor on 
week 4, and again in the finals. This helped the original version get back 
in the UK charts in the second half of 2009.[51] The song was one of the 
choices to be the series' winner single, but Journey did not like the arrangement 
of The X Factor version.[52] "The Climb" by Miley Cyrus was eventually 
chosen.[53] McElderry still frequently performs the song in his live shows, 
occasionally changing the lyrics, "born and raised in South Detroit" to 
"born and raised in South Shields." The housemates of Big Brother 2010 
recorded a version of the song, coached by Andrew Stone of Pineapple Dance 
Studios, in July 2010.[54] Stone also choreographed and shot a video of 
the performance. According to Digital Spy, the video "almost out-Glees 
Glee"[55] Steve and Rachel sang the lead vocals. On May 17, 2013 singer 
Fatin Shidqia along with Novita Dewi performed this song during the Grand 
Final of X Factor Indonesia.[56] Hungarian band Jumprockers made a cover 
of the song, in the style of jumpstyle in 2013. This version kept the original 
vocals but a brand new guitar solo part was recorded. In 2014 German DJ 
Higheffect released ten cover versions with Portuguese singer Silvia Dias 
as the leading voice.[57] MP3 Seller Musicload categorized it Dancepop.[58] 
On the 2009 compilation album Rock of Ages, Starship, formed from Jefferson 
Starship, covered this song. This should not be confused with the soundtrack 
to the film Rock of Ages. "Don't Stop Believin'" was recorded by the cast 
of American television series, Glee. It is the first single released from 
the soundtrack of the series, Glee: The Music, Volume 1 and was performed 
on the first episode of the initial season, "Pilot".[59] A portion of the 
song was covered again in the episode "The Rhodes Not Taken". A second 
version was covered by the cast in the first season's finale episode, "Journey 
to Regionals", for the glee club's Regionals competition; it is included 
in the EP soundtrack, Glee: The Music, Journey to Regionals. A third version 
was covered by Lea Michele as Rachel Berry in the nineteenth episode of 
the fourth season of the show, "Sweet Dreams"; it was released as a single 
April 23, 2013. A fourth version was performed in the 2014 episode "New 
Directions".[60] The Glee arrangement was adapted from Petra Haden's version.[61] 
The "Regionals Version" earned a nomination for Grammy Award for Best Pop 
Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for the 2011 ceremony. Released 
as a digital download on June 2, 2009, the song performed well in the United 
States, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Australia, where it charted within 
the top five of their national charts. The cast performance of "Don't Stop 
Believin'" was certified gold in the US in October 2009 and platinum in 
March 2011, achieving over 1,000,000 digital sales,[62] and platinum in 
Australia, with sales of over 70,000.[63] It remains the most popular recording 
in the show's history, having sold 1,422,000 copies in the United States 
alone.[64] "Don't Stop Believin'" was put on the BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 
2 playlists in the UK in January 2010. Aly Semigan of Entertainment Weekly 
critically praised the song stating "Fox's Glee put the ultimate earworm 
back in its rightful place." She then continued saying "even if you aren't 
one for show choirs (which, is quite frankly, shocking), it's pretty damn 
hard to resist." Semigan also compared it to the original version stating 
"it sounds slightly different in this Freaks and Geeks meets High School 
Musical pilot, but it's a good kind of different."[65] The Almighty Glee 
Club did their remix version including a radio edit, club mix, dub mix 
and instrumental. Pop-Punk band All Time Low performed a cover of this 
during several live concerts, and was featured once in a special of their 
straight-to-DVD concert video. In the United States, the song debuted at 
No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 on week dated June 6, 2009 with sales of 
177,000 copies in its first week, behind Black Eyed Peas's "Boom Boom Pow", 
Lady Gaga's "Poker Face" and Jamie Foxx's "Blame It", respectively the 
number one, number two and number three on the chart.[68][69] The song 
received certification Platinum by RIAA for more 1.4 million copies of 
digital sold which is also their best-selling song to date.[69] "Don't 
Stop Believin'" was part of the setlist of Glee Cast's worldwide 2010/11 
concert tour, Glee Live! In Concert! tour. On April 7, 2010, Glee Cast
