Robert Moses "Lefty" Grove (March 6, 1900 – May 22, 1975) was a professional 
baseball pitcher. After having success in the minor leagues during the 
early 1920s, Grove became a star in Major League Baseball with the American 
League's Philadelphia Athletics and Boston Red Sox, winning 300 games in 
his 17-year MLB career. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of 
Fame in 1947. One of the greatest left-handed pitchers in major league 
history, Grove led the American League in wins in four separate seasons, 
in strikeouts seven years in a row, and had the league's lowest earned 
run average a record nine times. Over the course of the three years from 
1929 to 1931 he twice won the pitcher's Triple Crown, leading the league 
in wins, strikeouts, and ERA, while amassing a 79-15 record as the ace 
for the Athletics' dynasty teams.[1] Born in Lonaconing, Maryland to John 
Robert Grove, (1865–1957), and Emma Catherine Beeman, (1872–1959), Grove 
was a sandlot star in the Baltimore area during the 1910s. Grove didn't 
play organized baseball until he was 19 years old. In 1920, he made his 
professional debut with the Martinsburg Mountaineers of the class-D Blue 
Ridge League, where he appeared in six games. In 59 innings pitched, Grove 
gave up just 30 hits, and he had an earned run average (ERA) of 1.68.[2] 
His performance attracted the attention of Jack Dunn, Sr. (1878–1928), 
the manager/owner of the minor league Baltimore Orioles, who also discovered 
George Herman ("Babe") Ruth (1895–1948). Grove joined the Baltimore Orioles 
in 1920, while they were playing a half-century in the minor leagues of 
first the old Eastern League (1903–1914) and then after 1916, in the reorganized 
International League of "Triple A" (AAA) ball. "Lefty" broke into the team's 
pitching rotation at midseason with a 12-2 record during their most famous 
winning championships sprint of 1919–1925, winning six straight titles. 
Over the next four seasons, he posted marks of 25-10, 18-8, 27-10 and 26-6, 
leading the International League in strikeouts each season. Grove remained 
in the minor leagues through 1924 because owner Jack Dunn, Sr. (1872–1928), 
refused several offers from the majors to acquire him. At the time, the 
Orioles were an independent operation with no major league affiliation 
and the International League had declared its players not subject to a 
major league draft. Since the reserve clause in all contracts was honored 
throughout organized baseball, this meant that Grove had no way to reach 
the majors until the Orioles became willing to trade or sell his contract. 
Finally, early in 1925, Dunn agreed to sell Grove's rights to Connie Mack 
(1862–1956), and his Philadelphia Athletics in the American League for 
$100,600, the highest amount ever paid for a player at the time. Grove 
battled injuries as a rookie and posted a 10-13 mark (which would prove 
his only losing record in 17 major league seasons), despite leading the 
league in strikeouts. Grove then settled down in 1926 and won the first 
of a record nine earned run average (ERA) titles with a mark of 2.51. In 
1927, Grove won 20 games for the first time, and a year later he led the 
league in wins with 24. In 1928, Grove twice struck out the side on nine 
pitches. On August 23, he did it in the second inning of a 3-1 win over 
the Cleveland Indians to become the third American League pitcher and seventh 
pitcher in major league history to accomplish the feat. On September 27, 
he did it in the seventh inning of a 5-3 win over the Chicago White Sox, 
becoming the first pitcher in major league history to accomplish the feat 
twice in a career; since then, only Sandy Koufax, Randy Johnson and, Nolan 
Ryan, all Hall of Famers, have joined him. Grove, however, remains the 
only pitcher to do it twice in the same season. The sportswriter Arthur 
"Bugs" Baer wrote, "Lefty Grove could throw a lamb chop past a wolf."[3] 
The Athletics won the pennant in three successive seasons (1929 to 1931), 
as well as consecutive World Series championships in 1929 and 1930. During 
the Athletics' championship run, Grove led the way as the league's top 
pitcher, posting records of 20-6, 28-5 and 31-4. In 1930, Grove led the 
league in wins, ERA (2.06), strikeouts (175), winning percentage, complete 
games, and shutouts. His 2.06 ERA was 2.32 runs below the league average.[4] 
He was also chosen as league MVP in 1931, making him one of only a handful 
of pitchers to achieve this honor. His M.V.P. award is the only one not 
enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, 
instead being housed at the George's Creek Library of the Western Maryland 
Regional Library system in Lonaconing. The Athletics contended for the 
next two seasons, but finished second to the New York Yankees in 1932 and 
third behind the Washington Senators and Yankees in 1933. In 1933, Grove 
became the first player in Major League Baseball history to strike out 
five times in a nine-inning game.[5] On December 12, 1933, team owner Connie 
Mack traded Grove, along with Max Bishop and Rube Walberg, to the Boston 
Red Sox for Bob Kline, Rabbit Warstler and $125,000. Grove was unable to 
contribute substantially during his first year in Boston, an arm injury 
holding him to an 8-8 record. In 1935, however, Grove returned to form 
with a 20-12 record and a league-leading 2.70 ERA. Grove won his eighth 
ERA title a year later, and also led the league in ERA and winning percentage 
in 1938. Grove continued to post outstanding records, including 14-4 in 
1938 and 15-4 in 1939, as well as lead the AL in ERA 4 times between 1935 
and 1939. In his last season, he won and lost 7 games, winning his 300th 
game on July 25 (giving up 6 runs on 12 hits, but winning 10-6), before 
losing his last three major league games, ending his career on September 
28, pitching just one inning in the 2nd game of a doubleheader. Grove retired 
in 1941 with a career record of 300-141. His .680 lifetime winning percentage 
is eighth all-time;[6] however, none of the seven men ahead of him won 
more than 236 games. His lifetime ERA of 3.06, when normalized to overall 
league ERA and adjusted for the parks in which Grove played during his 
career, is fourth all-time among pitchers with at least 1,000 innings pitched 
(behind Mariano Rivera, Jim Devlin, and Pedro Martínez) at 48 percent better 
than average.[7] Grove was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame 
in 1947. He died in Norwalk, Ohio and was interred in the Frostburg Memorial 
Cemetery in Frostburg, Maryland. In 1969 Grove was voted starting pitcher 
for the 100th anniversary team. In 1999, Grove was ranked number 23 on 
The Sporting News list of Baseball's Greatest Players.[8] He ranked second, 
behind only Warren Spahn, among left-handed pitchers (third when Babe Ruth 
is counted as a pitcher as well as an outfielder) although Babe Ruth never 
pitched long enough to be considered. That same year, Grove was elected
