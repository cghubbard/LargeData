David Lee Wells (born May 20, 1963), nicknamed "Boomer", is an American 
former Major League Baseball pitcher. Wells was considered to be one of 
the game's better left-handed pitchers, especially during his years with 
the New York Yankees and the Toronto Blue Jays. He pitched the 15th perfect 
game in baseball history. He is tied only with Kenny Lofton for appearing 
in the post-season with six teams. Wells is currently a broadcaster on 
MLB on TBS and the host of The Cheap Seats on FOXSports.com. Wells was 
born in Torrance, California. He grew up in the San Diego neighborhood 
of Ocean Beach[1] and attended local public schools. He graduated from 
Point Loma High School in 1982. He was a self-described "gym rat" who spent 
most of his time at the Ocean Beach Recreation Center and Robb Field.[2] 
Baseball facilities at both Point Loma High School and Dana Middle School 
are named for him.[3] He lives in San Diego with his wife and two sons.[1] 
He has a tattoo of Babe Ruth.[4] Wells debuted for the Toronto Blue Jays 
in 1987 as a reliever and did not secure a job as a full-time starter until 
he was 30 years old. During his six seasons with the Blue Jays, Wells compiled 
a 47-46 record and a 3.88 ERA altogether. Wells was part of the 1992 World 
Series winning team, the first time he got a championship ring. He was 
released by the Blue Jays during spring training in 1993. Shortly after 
he was released by the Blue Jays, Wells signed for the Detroit Tigers. 
He emerged as a top-flight pitcher in 1995, when he was 32. After starting 
the year at 10-3 for the struggling last-place Tigers, Wells made his first 
All-Star Game appearance. Wells had a 26-19 record and a 3.73 ERA during 
his tenure with the Tigers. Wells was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for 
C. J. Nitkowski, Mark Lewis, and minor leaguer Dave Tuttle. He finished 
the rest of the 1995 season with a 6-5 record and a 3.59 ERA. At the end 
of the season he was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Curtis Goodwin 
and minor leaguer Trovin Valdez. In 1996, he pitched then-career high 224 
innings but finished with an 11–14 record and a 5.14 ERA. In 1997, Wells 
signed as a free agent with the New York Yankees, his favorite team because 
of a lifelong interest in baseball legend Babe Ruth. He asked for uniform 
number 3, Ruth's long-retired number, and was of course denied. He ended 
up taking 33 for the Yankees. On June 28, 1997, Wells took the mound wearing 
an authentic 1934 Babe Ruth hat, which he had bought for $35,000. Manager 
Joe Torre made Wells take it off after the first inning because it didn't 
conform to uniform standards. Wells then blew a 3–0 lead as the Cleveland 
Indians won 12–8. After posting a 16-10 mark in 1997, Wells pitched very 
well in the Yankees' record-setting 1998 season. He rang up an 18-4 record, 
finished fifth in the league in ERA (3.49) and was third in voting for 
the Cy Young Award. On May 17, 1998, Wells pitched the 15th perfect game 
in baseball history, when he blanked the Minnesota Twins, 4–0. Wells attended 
the same San Diego high school, Point Loma High School, as Don Larsen, 
whose perfect game for the Yankees in the 1956 World Series was the only 
perfect game or no-hitter ever thrown in postseason play until 2010, and 
was until then the only perfect game thrown by a Yankee. David Cone would 
add a third Yankee perfect game in 1999. Wells claimed that he threw the 
perfect game while being hung over.[5][6] On September 1, 1998, Wells came 
fairly close to recording a second perfect game. Pitching against the Oakland 
Athletics, he allowed no walks and only two hits, the first of which came 
with two outs in the seventh inning when Jason Giambi fought off an 0-2 
count and singled.[7] After the season, Wells returned to the Blue Jays 
as part of a trade for Roger Clemens, along with Homer Bush and Graeme 
Lloyd. He continued to win north of the border, with records of 17–10 and 
20–8 over the next two years. Wells along with fellow pitcher Matt DeWitt 
were traded to the Chicago White Sox, in a deal that was quickly mired 
in controversy. The primary player being traded by the White Sox, starting 
pitcher Mike Sirotka, was injured at the time of the deal, and he never 
pitched in the major leagues again. Toronto's general manager, Gord Ash, 
had not made the deal contingent on the results of a medical examination, 
however, and MLB ruled in favor of the White Sox. The Blue Jays thus received 
only Kevin Beirne, Brian Simmons, and minor leaguer Mike Williams, and 
the mistake ultimately cost Ash his job. The deal did not turn out particularly 
well for the White Sox, either, as Wells struggled with back problems in 
2001 and pitched only 100⅔ innings. Wells went 5-7 with a 4.47 ERA during 
his year with the White Sox. After a short season with the White Sox, Wells 
returned to the Yankees, a deal that was again immersed in controversy 
as he had already reached an oral agreement to join the Arizona Diamondbacks.[8] 
Despite having lost some velocity from his fastball, he retained his excellent 
curveball and his control, and posted an outstanding 19–7 record in 2002. 
Wells was the subject of some controversy prior to the 2003 season, when 
his autobiography Perfect I'm Not: Boomer on Beer, Brawls, Backaches and 
Baseball, was published. The book upset the Yankees' management, and Wells 
was fined $100,000 by the team for disparaging comments which appeared 
in it.[9] One of them included himself having a hangover when he pitched 
his perfect game.[9][10] Among the other controversial statements were 
claims that he strengthened his pitching arm as a youth by throwing rocks 
at homeless people[10] and that his minor league team, the Kinston Blue 
Jays, had segregated stands in 1983 despite ample evidence to the contrary. 
Amusingly, Wells claimed to have been misquoted in the book, which was 
presumably penned by a ghost writer. The problems didn't carry over to 
the field, however. Wells posted a 15–7 record and helped the Yankees win 
another pennant.[11] On September 28, 2003, the final day of the regular 
season, Wells earned the 200th win of his career in a game managed by Clemens, 
who had won his 300th game earlier in the season and was thought to be 
retiring from baseball (Clemens ended up delaying his retirement). Regular 
Yankees manager Joe Torre let Clemens manage the final game of the regular 
season, and Clemens pulled Wells from the game in the eighth inning.[12] 
He was also criticized by Yankee fans for not being able to pitch during 
Game 5 of the 2003 World Series. He started the game, but left during the 
first inning because of a bad backache, which caused Torre to use his bullpen 
to finish the game.[13] The Yankees ended up losing the game and the series 
to the Florida Marlins in six games. On January 1, 2004, Wells was signed 
as a free agent by the San Diego Padres to a one-year contract. Wells posted 
a 12–8 record with a 3.73 ERA to start off his second stint in the National 
League. On December 11, 2004, Wells signed a two-year deal with the Boston 
Red Sox and took the uniform number 3, in honor of Babe Ruth. Getting off 
to a bad start, many fans questioned the decision of general manager Theo 
Epstein, but after coming off of the DL and getting rocked in his first 
start back in Oakland — and changing his uniform number from 3 to 16 – 
David Wells became the same dominating pitcher he was in the past. He went 
on to post a 15-7 record, with a 4.45 ERA. Wells pitched much better than 
his ERA may show, but had a few very poor outings, which caused his ERA 
to "balloon." After the 2005 season, Wells requested a trade back to the 
West Coast, but he eventually withdrew that request and resigned himself 
to one last year pitching for the Red Sox. Wells began the 2006 season 
on the disabled list, as he was still recovering from surgery performed 
on his right knee. After pitching one game on April 12, he was again placed 
on the 15-day disabled list. He announced that if his knee did not improve 
he would retire. Wells came off the disabled list on May 26, to make his 
second start of the year against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. On August 31, 
2006, with the Red Sox postseason chances fading, Wells' wish of finishing 
his career playing for a West Coast team and a playoff contender was granted 
when he was traded back to the Padres for top catching prospect George 
Kottaras. Following the 2006 season, Wells filed for free agency. For players 
who are already planning on retiring, this is a customary move in case 
one changes his mind. Wells' agent had stated the pitcher will keep his 
options open but his physical condition will play a large part in making 
the final decision whether or not to return for another season.[14] Eventually, 
Wells decided to stay with the Padres, agreeing in principle on a one-year 
deal worth $3 million in base salary with a possible $4 million more in 
incentives. On March 18, 2007, the media revealed that Wells has been diagnosed 
with Type 2 diabetes. This form of diabetes is more closely associated 
with lifestyle factors, such as diet, but the condition of people with 
a genetic disposition for diabetes can be exacerbated with chronic high 
blood sugar, as insulin resistance can be an adaptation of insulin in the 
wake of too-high blood sugar over time.[15] On August 8, the Padres announced 
they would cut ties with Wells when Chris Young was ready to come off the 
disabled list.[16] On August 23, 2007, Wells was signed by the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. His first start with the Dodgers was on August 26 against the 
New York Mets. He pitched five innings and allowed two earned runs. Wells 
also reached first base on a bunt single, scored a run, and earned the 
victory. He was the oldest pitcher to start a game for the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. On September 13, 2007, against his former team, the San Diego 
Padres, Wells had his first multi-hit game of his 21-year career at the 
age of 44. He hit a single and a double off former teammate Greg Maddux. 
Wells finished the season with the Dodgers going 4-1 with a 5.12 ERA. Wells 
filed for free agency after the 2007 season. On August 2, 2008, Wells took 
part in the 62nd Annual Old Timers Day at Yankee Stadium, where he said 
that he was not going to officially retire, but admitted that his pitching 
career was probably over.[17] Beginning in 2009, Wells began working for 
MLB on TBS doing regular & post-season coverage. In 2011, Wells became 
host of The Cheap Seats on FOXSports.com. In 2010, David Wells was interviewed 
by Jane Mitchell for the television show One on One. In addition to David's 
story in his own words, the interview featured Kevin Towers, Trevor Hoffman, 
Josh Barfield, Chris Young, Mariano Rivera, Derek Jeter, Clay Hensley, 
family, and friends, all sharing their personal experiences and thoughts 
about David.[18] Wells served as a baseball assistant coach at his alma 
mater Point Loma High School for several years. The high school announced 
on June 17, 2014 that Wells will be the head baseball coach there, starting 
with the 2014–2015 school year. The team's home field was named David Wells 
Field in 2010.[19]>[20] In 2014 David Wells field went through a two-million-dollar 
renovation which was underwritten by the San Diego Unified School District
