Eric Orlando Young Sr. (born May 18, 1967) is a former Major League Baseball 
second baseman and left fielder. He played college baseball and college 
football for Rutgers University. He resides in New Brunswick, New Jersey. 
Young began his MLB career with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1992, but soon 
became one of the original Colorado Rockies in 1993. He hit a home run 
in the Rockies' first-ever home at bat on April 9, 1993, as part of an 
11-4 home win over the Montreal Expos.[1] He helped Colorado to its first 
postseason series appearance in 1995, which they lost to the Atlanta Braves, 
three games to one. His best seasons came with the Rockies, where he was 
an All-Star and a Silver Slugger Award winner in 1996 at second base. In 
1996, he hit .324, with 8 home runs, 74 RBI and 53 stolen bases. During 
the 1990s, Young was one of the top base stealers in the major leagues. 
He is the Rockies career leader in stolen bases and is in the top 10 in 
many other offensive categories. On June 30, 1996, he managed to steal 
second base, third base, and home plate in one inning in a game against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 1997, fan favorite Young was traded back to 
Los Angeles for pitcher Pedro Astacio. While in Los Angeles during 1998â€“1999, 
Young continued his consistency by stealing bases and hitting for solid 
averages. Young was traded by the Dodgers to the Chicago Cubs in 1999. 
In 2000, while a member of the Cubs, he hit .297, with 6 home runs, 98 
runs and 54 steals. In 2001, he enjoyed a similar season. In January 2002, 
Young signed as a free agent with the Milwaukee Brewers. In 2003, he hit 
15 home runs, a career-high that almost doubled his previous best of 8 
home runs. Young went on to play with the Texas Rangers and the San Diego 
Padres, where he was mainly used as a pinch runner. On August 1, 2006, 
Young was released by the Padres. He was subsequently reacquired by the 
Rangers and joined the team later that month. In late October, he declared 
free agency, but did not end up playing in the Majors again. Young's son, 
Eric Young Jr., is following in his father's footsteps. Eric Jr. graduated 
from Piscataway Township High School in 2003 and on August 25, 2009 made 
his major league debut with Colorado Rockies when Dexter Fowler was put 
on the disabled list. Young officially retired as a member of the Colorado 
Rockies on September 12, 2008.[2] He was honored during a pregame ceremony 
that same day at Coors Field before the Rockies took on the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. Young is also an analyst on the sports program Baseball Tonight. 
He is often mentioned in the term "Souvenir City Chamber of Commerce, Eric 
Young President" which is the term used by host Steve Berthiaume when showing 
a home run. He also calls out "Souvenir City!" when showing footage of 
a home run.[3] Young served as a running instructor for the Houston Astros 
and helped with their outfield and base running.[4] Young was named the 
Arizona Diamondbacks first base coach on October 17, 2010.[5] On October 
17, 2012, Young was fired from the position.[6][7] He joined the Rockies
