Richard Sidney Bleier (born April 16, 1987) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Used as both a starting pitcher and a relief pitcher in his career, the 
left-hander throws a fastball that hits the low 90s, a changeup, a curveball, 
and a slider.[1] His approach is to "pitch to contact," and use excellent 
control.[2] Bleier was born in Davie, Florida.[3] Bleier's father, Lawrence, 
is from the Bronx, in New York City, and grew up playing stickball in Brownsville, 
Brooklyn; his mother is Kathy Bleier.[4][5][6] Bleier has a brother and 
a sister, and is Jewish.[6][7] His wife is Brett Bleier.[8] Bleier played 
baseball at South Plantation High School in Plantation, Florida, from which 
he graduated in 2005. As a freshman, he was 5-foot-6, and 117 pounds.[9] 
He was chosen for the county and state All Star games in 2005.[10] He played 
college baseball at Florida Gulf Coast University for the Eagles in Fort 
Myers, Florida on a partial scholarship.[6][11] By 2008, Bleier had grown 
to 6-foot-4 and 210 pounds, and was throwing 90 mph.[9] In his junior year 
of college he was selected unanimously as the Atlantic Sun Conference Pitcher 
of the Year and First Team All Sun Conference after he had a 7–1 win-loss 
record and a 2.09 earned run average (ERA), leading the conference in wins, 
ERA, complete games, and innings pitched.[12][6][10][13][14] In his three 
years at the university, he had a 2.70 ERA (2nd-best all-time in school 
history), 17 wins (7th), and 181 strikeouts (7th).[15] Bleier was drafted 
by the Texas Rangers in the sixth round of the 2008 Major League Baseball 
Draft, after his junior year in college.[12] His signing made him the highest 
draft pick in the history of Florida Gulf Coast University.[12] He played 
in the Rangers, Toronto Blue Jays, and Washington Nationals organizations.[16] 
In 2009, he was 9-12 and his 125 strikeouts were the second-most in the 
Rangers' minor league system.[17][18] Bleier was voted Pitcher of the Week 
in the Class AA Texas League with the Rangers' Frisco RoughRiders on both 
May 10, 2010, and June 6, 2011.[12] In 2012, Bleier, by virtue of his Jewish 
heritage, played for the Israel national baseball team in the qualifying 
rounds of the 2013 World Baseball Classic.[19][20] He pitched one scoreless 
inning, in two appearances.[21] In the 2015 season, Bleier had the most 
wins (14) and the lowest ERA (2.57) of all minor league pitchers in the 
Washington Nationals minor league system.[12] He was a post-season Class 
AA Eastern League All Star with Harrisburg in 2015.[12] In 2015, he was 
also voted a Washington organization All Star by MILB.com.[12] He was voted 
Pitcher of the Week in the Eastern League with the Nationals' Harrisburg 
Senators on May 25, 2015.[12] After he elected free agency, Bleier signed 
with the Yankees prior to the 2016 season.[12] Bleier was called up to 
the majors for the first time on May 26, 2016, by the New York Yankees.[5] 
He debuted in the majors on May 30, becoming the 27th Yankee to wear uniform 
number 50.[22][5] His debut followed nine minor league seasons in which 
he pitched 956 innings, and Bleier was one of 12 Yankees pitchers since 
1919 to make his debut after turning 29 years old, and the first since 
Amauri Sanit in 2011.[23][6] He became the third former FGCU player to 
play in the majors, joining pitchers Chris Sale and Casey Coleman.[5] Yankee 
manager Joe Girardi said: "I can use him either way – for distance or I 
could use him if I wanted (to pitch to) a couple lefties. He’s a ground 
ball guy. He gets a ton of ground balls.... He was a starter down there,
