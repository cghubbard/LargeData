Under Armour, Inc. is an American sports clothing and accessories company. 
The company is a supplier of sportswear and casual apparel.[3] Under Armour 
began offering footwear in 2006.[4] Under Armour's global headquarters 
is located in Baltimore, Maryland with additional North American corporate 
office locations in Austin and Houston Texas; Denver, Colorado.; New York, 
New York; Portland, Oregon; Nashville, Tennessee; and Toronto, Canada. 
Under Armour's International Headquarters is located in Panama City, Panama, 
with Latin America offices in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil; Santiago, Chile; and Mexico 
City, Mexico. Its European headquarters is in Amsterdam's Olympic Stadium 
with an additional office in Munich, Germany.[5] The Under Armour Shanghai 
office is the regional headquarters for Greater China. Additional Asia 
Pacific offices are in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, China; Jakarta, Indonesia; 
Tokyo, Japan; and Sydney, Australia.[6] Under Armour was founded in 1996 
by Kevin Plank, a then 23-year-old former special teams captain of the 
University of Maryland football team. Plank initially began the business 
from his grandmother's basement in Washington, D.C.[7] He spent his time 
traveling up and down the East Coast with nothing but apparel in the trunk 
of his car. His first team sale came at the end of 1996 with a $17,000 
sale. From his grandmother's basement, Plank moved to Baltimore. After 
a few moves in the city he landed at his current headquarters in Tide Point.[8] 
As a fullback at the University of Maryland, Plank got tired of having 
to change out of the sweat-soaked T-shirts worn under his jersey; however, 
he noticed that his compression shorts worn during practice stayed dry. 
This inspired him to make a T-shirt using moisture-wicking synthetic fabric.[9] 
After graduating from the University of Maryland, Plank developed his first 
prototype of the shirt, which he gave to his Maryland teammates and friends 
who had gone on to play in the NFL. Plank soon perfected the design creating 
a new T-shirt built from microfibers that wicked moisture and kept athletes 
cool, dry, and light.[7] Major competing brands including Nike, Adidas 
and Reebok would soon follow in Plank's footsteps with their own moisture-wicking 
apparel.[10] Plank opted to use the British spelling "armour" in the company 
name because the toll-free vanity number was still available for that version.[11] 
People began to take notice of the brand when a front page photo of USA 
Today featured Oakland Raiders quarterback Jeff George wearing an Under 
Armour mock turtleneck. Following that front page, Under Armour's first 
major sale came, when an equipment manager from Georgia Tech requested 
10 shirts from Plank. This deal opened the door to a contract with Arizona 
State University, North Carolina State and other Division I football teams. 
With positive reviews from players, word began to spread and orders began 
to increase.[9] That same year, Under Armour launched with several new 
apparel lines including ColdGear, TurfGear, AllseasonGear, and StreetGear.[9] 
By the end of 1996, Under Armour had sold 500 Under Armour HeatGear shirts, 
generating $17,000 for the company.[9] In 1997, Plank had $100,000 in orders 
to fill and found a factory in Ohio to make the shirts. Under Armour received 
its first big break in 1999 when Warner Brothers contacted Under Armour 
to outfit two of its feature films, Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday and 
The Replacements.[7] In Any Given Sunday, Willie Beamen (played by Jamie 
Foxx) wears an Under Armour jockstrap. Leveraging the release of Any Given 
Sunday, Plank purchased an ad in ESPN The Magazine. The ad generated close 
to $750,000 in sales, and nine years after starting the company, Plank 
finally put himself on the payroll.[citation needed] The following year, 
Under Armour became the outfitter of the new XFL football league, gaining 
even more attention during the league's debut on national television.[9] 
In 2003, consumer sector focused private equity firm Rosewood Capital invested 
$12 million into the company.[12] The same year, the company launched its 
first television commercial, which centered on their motto, "Protect this 
house."[7] The company IPOd on the NASDAQ in November 2005, raising $153m 
of capital.[13] In late 2007, Under Armour opened its first full-line full-price 
retail location at the Westfield Annapolis mall in Annapolis, Maryland.[14] 
It has also opened several specialty stores and factory outlet locations 
in Canada, China, and 39 states including the opening of its first Brand 
House in Baltimore in 2013 and second Brand House in Tyson's Corner, Virginia.[15] 
In 2009, baseball Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr. formed an alliance under 
which the company would have significant presence at several venues and 
events under the auspices of Ripken Baseball, including providing uniforms 
for the minor league Aberdeen IronBirds and youth teams participating in 
the Cal Ripken World Series.[16] The company is reported to be the major 
commercial sponsor for the reality TV show Duck Dynasty and has garnered 
attention for taking a stand supporting show "patriarch" Phil Robertson.[17] 
Under Armour provided the suits worn by speedskaters in the 2014 Winter 
Olympics. The US speedskaters were losing while wearing the new Mach 39 
speedsuits, but when they reverted to the previous model suits, the skaters 
continued to lose. Although there did not appear to be a design flaw in 
the suit that caused the poor results, the news of the suits caused Under 
Armour stock to drop 2.38%.[18] The company, offering a reported US$250,000,000 
over 10 years, also bid hard over Nike to sign NBA MVP Kevin Durant to 
an endorsement deal. However, Nike ultimately re-signed Durant after agreeing 
to structure a contract, offering US$300,000,000.[19] On January 21, 2014, 
it was announced that the University of Notre Dame and Under Armour had 
come to terms on providing uniforms and athletic equipment for the university. 
This 10-year deal was the largest of its kind in the history of college 
athletics and became effective July 1, 2014. As of 2014, Under Armour has 
operated revenue and operating profit more than 30%, accelerating from 
their 2013 pace. Its share price has soared 62.5% this year.[19] After 
its November 2013 acquisition of digital app maker MapMyFitness for US$150,000,000, 
in February 2015 Under Armour announced it had purchased the calorie and 
nutrition counting app maker MyFitnessPal for $475m, as well as the fitness 
app maker Endomondo for US$85,000,000.[20][21] On January 6, 2016, Under 
Armour announced a strategic partnership with IBM to use IBM Watson's cognitive 
computing technology to provide meaningful data from its IOT kit and UA 
Record app.[22] On March 3, 2016, the company became the Official Match 
Ball Partner of the North American Soccer League, starting with their 2016 
season.[23][24] May 26, 2016 Under Armour and UCLA announced their plans 
for a 15-year, $280 million contract, making this the largest show and 
apparel sponsorship in NCAA history.[25] In July 2016 Under Armour leased 
the 53,000 square feet space formerly occupied by FAO Schwarz on New York's 
Fifth Avenue; it projected that its store would open in 2018.[26][27] FAO 
Schwartz had been paying $20 million in rent.[27] The expansion of Under 
Armour's product lines, such as TurfGear, AllseasonGear, and StreetGear 
put Under Armour at the forefront of the emerging performance apparel industry.[7] 
In 2003, Under Armour launched their Women's Performance Gear product line.[7] 
Under Armour announced an addition to their ColdGear product line, called 
Infrared, that was released in 2013.[28] This line claims to disseminate 
heat using ceramic powder and re-circulate heat around the wearer's body. 
This was purportedly designed so that the wearer's heat signature will 
not be picked up. Under Armour also had released a product with scent control 
technology in 2012 titled, "Under Armour Scent Control". This line claims 
to be designed so that the wearer's scent cannot be detected.[29] Under 
Armour is inventing a new type of shirt called "Coldblack," which is designed 
to reflect heat and keep athletes cool in the sun.[30] Under Armour has 
come out with new styles for football uniforms. In October 2012, Under 
Armour created "The Wounded Warrior" project for football uniforms.[31] 
The University of Hawaii and Boston College wore the star studded cleats 
and the American striped jerseys. They were revealed when Boston College 
played Maryland on October 27, 2012, also when Hawaii played UNLV on November 
24, 2012.[31] The company produces the Speedform shoe in a Chinese bra 
factory. It has no insole and little stitching. Shoes are Under Armour's 
fastest growing product line, growing 31% from 2011 to $239 million in 
sales in 2012.[32] On April 29, 2009, the United States Consumer Products 
Safety Commission announced a voluntary recall of all Under Armour brand 
athletic cups. The cups might break when hit, posing a risk of serious 
injury. They were sold from January 2006 through March 2009.[33] On November 
3, 2011, the United States Consumer Products Safety Commission announced 
a voluntary recall of all Under Armour Defender chin straps. The straps 
pose a laceration hazard when a player contacts the metal snap. They were 
sold from January 2008 through September 2011.[34] In 2014, sales of apparel, 
footwear and accessories represented 74.3%, 14% and 9.9% of net revenues, 
respectively. Revenue has grown by steadily by 30% from 2010-2014.[35] 
As of January 28, 2016 the fourth quarter net revenues for 2015 increased 
31% to $1.17 Billion while the full year net revenues increased 28% to 
$3.96 Billion. Based on these numbers, Under Armour has updated its 2016 
net revenues outlook to approximately $4.95 Billion (+25%). [36] Of Under 
Armour's current consumer base, 53% of Under Armour's customers are male 
and 47% of customers are female. Over 36% of customers have graduated from 
college, the majority of Under Armour's customers fall within the age range 
of 25-34, with the smallest customer base consisting of those aged 65+. 
49.9% of Under Armour's customers have a household income ranging from 
$75,000 to $149,000 (Gfk Mediamark Research & Intelligence, 2015).[37] 
UA Give Back is Under Armour's effort to become involved in different facets 
of the world community. They have different branches in their organization 
that specialize in each cause that Under Armour supports. They consist 
of the UA Power in Pink, UA Freedom and UA Win Global.[38] UA Power in 
Pink is an Under Armour program that promotes women using exercise and 
fitness to fight breast cancer.[39] UA Freedom is an Under Armour program 
that supports the efforts of the Wounded Warrior Project whose mission 
is to honor, raise awareness, and aid wounded veterans and military service 
members.[40] UA Win Global is a children's athletics program which focuses 
on "underserved communities" by enhancing play areas, investing in sports 
programs and providing support for sports coaches.[41] As of 2012, Under 
Armour was the sponsor of the Baseball Factory's "Premium Video Program", 
which holds more than 100 events for youth athletes across the United States 
annually.[42] Under Armour promotes its products by sponsorship agreements 
with many celebrity athletes, professional teams and college athletic teams, 
a field in which it competes with other sports apparel companies.[43][44] 
Under Armour also markets its products through product placements: In 2015, 
Under Armour released plans for their new Under Armour Fitness Performance 
Center at the Bank of America Building at 10 Light Street in Baltimore. 
The Fitness Performance Center is planned to take place in the building's 
lobby, covering historic murals of Baltimore's history by art deco artist 
Hildreth Meiere with artificial turf flooring. This plan has been seen 
as controversial due to the fact that Kevin Plank and developer Cary Euwer 
used state and federal tax credits to restore the historical building, 
yet the historical murals are being covered up by turf flooring.[48] Many 
historians and local Baltimoreans have expressed public outcry that the 
design should be reconsidered and the murals should be saved. In January 
2016 Under Armour initiated a marketing campaign featuring women hunters 
including an American woman named Sarah Bowmar.[49][50] In August 2016 
a video filmed by Bowmar went viral that showed her husband spearing a 
bear and then rejoicing that he had hit it; the bear was found dead only 
the next day.[49][51] Under Armour was heavily criticized worldwide and 
as result, Under Armour ended its contract with Bowmar a few days after 
the video became known.[49] Hunters reacted negatively with a campaign
