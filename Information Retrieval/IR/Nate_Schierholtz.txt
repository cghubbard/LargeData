Nathan John "Nate" Schierholtz (born February 15, 1984), is an American 
professional baseball outfielder who is a free agent. He has played in 
Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants (2007–2012), Philadelphia 
Phillies (2012), Chicago Cubs (2013–2014), and Washington Nationals (2014) 
He has also played in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for Hiroshima 
Toyo Carp (2015). After one year at Chabot College, Schierholtz was selected 
by the San Francisco Giants in the second round of the 2003 Major League 
Baseball (MLB) Draft. He reached the Major Leagues in 2007 but did not 
make the Giants' roster full-time until 2009. In the meantime, he played 
for the 2008 USA Olympic Baseball Team, which won a bronze medal. In 2009 
and 2010, he served mostly as a pinch hitter and defensive substitution, 
winning the World Series with the Giants in 2010. By May 2011, he had gotten 
everyday playing time in right field due to the benching of Pat Burrell; 
however, he would break his foot in August and miss the end of the season. 
He lost his right field job in 2012 and, after an interview with the San 
Francisco Chronicle, was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies as part of 
the deal that brought Hunter Pence to San Francisco. Schierholtz broke 
his right big toe with the Phillies, causing him to miss a few weeks, and 
he was made a free agent by them after the season. He signed with the Chicago 
Cubs and, for the first time in his career, got to play right field every 
day for the whole season, setting career-highs in many categories. He re-signed 
with the Cubs in 2014 but was released in August. Picked up by the Washington 
Nationals shortly after his release, Schierholtz reached the playoffs again 
as a reserve outfielder. Schierholtz attended San Ramon Valley High School 
in Danville, California, the same high school as former Giants teammate 
Randy Winn.[1] At San Ramon Valley, he served as the team captain. Following 
high school, Schierholtz played for Chabot College, a community college 
located in Hayward, California. He spent the 2003 season with Chabot, starting 
at third base.[2] In his lone season at Chabot, he was named an All-American.[3] 
Schierholtz was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the second round 
(63rd overall) of the 2003 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft. He began 
his minor league career that year as a third baseman with the rookie Arizona 
League Giants, batting .400 in 11 games before getting promoted to the 
Single-A short season Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Northwest League.[4] 
In 35 games for Salem-Keizer, he hit .306 with 38 hits, three home runs, 
and 29 runs batted in (RBI).[5] He began the 2004 season with the Single-A 
Hagerstown Suns of the South Atlantic League, earning All-star game honors 
for that league. He batted .296 with 53 RBI in 58 games and was leading 
the league in home runs (15) and extra-base hits (37) before getting promoted 
to the Single-A advanced San Jose Giants of the California League.[4] At 
San Jose, though still receiving significant playing time as a third baseman, 
he began to play the outfield as well.[5] In 62 games with San Jose, he 
batted .295 with three home runs and 31 RBI. He was second on the team 
with nine triples after not hitting any with Hagerstown. He was third among 
Giants' prospects with 18 home runs and ranked second with 84 RBI in 2004.[4] 
In 2005, Schierholtz remained at San Jose, where he became an everyday 
right fielder. Over 128 games, he batted .319 (fifth in the California 
League) with 160 hits (tied with Chris Lubanski, Seth Smith, and Clay Timpner 
for fifth), 37 doubles (tied with Danny Putnam for eighth), eight triples 
(tied with Wladimir Balentien, Danny Richar, and Joe Gaetti for third behind 
Timpner's 12 and Anthony Webster's 11), 15 home runs, and 86 RBI.[6] He 
batted .333 in the playoffs, helping San Jose win the California League 
championship.[4] Schierholtz moved up to the Double-A Connecticut Defenders 
of the Eastern League in 2006. In 125 games, he batted .270 with 127 hits, 
14 home runs, and 54 RBI.[5] He led the Defenders in most major batting 
categories and finished sixth in the Eastern League with seven triples.[4][7] 
Entering the 2007 season, Schierholtz was ranked the eighth-best prospect 
in the Giants' organization by Baseball America.[8] That year, he was assigned 
to the Triple-A Fresno Grizzlies of the Pacific Coast League. He spent 
most of the season with them. In 109 games, he had 137 hits, 31 doubles, 
16 home runs, and 68 RBI. He finished third in the league in batting average 
(.333, behind Geovany Soto's .353 and Delwyn Young's .337) and triples 
(seven, tied with Scott Seabol behind Reggie Abercrombie's and Jeff Salazar's 
nine).[9] Giants' manager Bruce Bochy considered calling up Schierholtz 
in May 2007 when Dave Roberts started suffering elbow problems, but an 
injury to Schierholtz prevented that. On June 11, Schierholtz was called 
up to replace Dan Ortmeier and try to give the Giants some offensive help.[10] 
He made his major league debut that day, against the Toronto Blue Jays 
as a defensive replacement.[11] He got his first hit the next night, against 
A. J. Burnett in his first career at bat in a 3–2 victory over Toronto.[12] 
During this stint, Schierholtz received most of the starts in right field.[13] 
On June 23, at AT&T Park against the New York Yankees, he blooped an RBI 
single into center field against Scott Proctor in the bottom of the 13th 
inning to win the game 6–5 for the Giants.[14] Despite a .325 batting average 
in 40 at bats, Schierholtz was sent down at the start of July to make room 
for Rich Aurilia, who was returning from the disabled list.[15][16] He 
was recalled in September, and he received most of the starts in right 
field that month.[13] In 39 games (112 at bats), he batted .304 with 34 
hits, five doubles, three triples, 10 RBI, and two walks.[4] In 2008, Baseball 
America ranked Schierholtz the fourth-best prospect in the Giants' system.[17] 
He attended spring training with the Giants but started the season in Fresno.[4] 
Schierholtz was batting .314 with fifteen home runs and 65 runs batted 
in for the Grizzlies when his minor league season ended as a result of 
his being selected for the 2008 USA Olympic Baseball Team. In the sixth 
inning of a preliminary round game against China, he collided with China 
backup catcher Yang Yang at the home plate on a sacrifice fly, a play that 
resulted in a near brawl between the teams and saw Chinese manager Jim 
Lefebvre ejected from the game.[18] Schierholtz played nine games with 
the Americans, batting .216 with four doubles, one home run, and six RBI 
as the United States earned a bronze medal.[4] Schierholtz was again called 
up in September 2008, as the Giants' roster expanded, and he was used as 
the Giants' starting right fielder for the remainder of the year.[19][20] 
On September 3, he had four hits in a game for the first time in a 9–2 
victory over the Colorado Rockies.[21] Three days later, he hit his first 
career home run against Jesse Chavez in a 7–6 victory over the Pittsburgh 
Pirates.[22] In 19 games (75 at bats) in 2008, Schierholtz hit .320 with 
24 hits, eight doubles, one triple, one home run, and five RBI.[4] Schierholtz 
started the 2009 season as a pinch hitter.[23] In June, he saw his playing 
time increase as Randy Winn, the Giants' right fielder, began playing left 
field frequently in place of Fred Lewis.[23][24][25] On June 14, he had 
an inside-the-park home run, only the fourth in AT&T Park history, in the 
third inning against Brett Anderson of the Oakland Athletics in a 7–1 victory.[26] 
He had four hits on June 28 in a 7–0 win over the Milwaukee Brewers.[27] 
From July 28 through August 12, he was on the disabled list with a bruised 
left hip.[4][28] He saw his playing time reduced in September as Winn moved 
back to right field to give Eugenio Vélez and John Bowker opportunities 
in left.[23][24][29][30] In a career-high 116 games (285 at bats) in 2009, 
Schierholtz batted .267 with 76 hits, five home runs, and 29 RBI. He had 
the third-highest batting average for a pinch hitter in the majors (.371, 
behind Smith's .472 and Hideki Matsui's .381).[4] Schierholtz was expected 
to be the Giants' Opening Day right fielder in 2010, but Bowker won the 
position after hitting six home runs in spring training.[31] Bowker, however, 
only held the job for 10 games before Schierholtz replaced him on April 
17.[32][33] In his first 16 games in the role, he batted .393, but over 
his next 19, he batted .154.[33] When Buster Posey was called up in late 
May, Aubrey Huff moved from first base to right field, leaving Schierholtz 
on the bench.[34][35][36] After Bengie Molina was traded, Posey switched 
from first base to catcher, but Travis Ishikawa began getting some starts 
at first base, creating a platoon between Schierholtz and Ishikawa, with 
Huff covering first base or right field depending on who was playing.[33][35][37][38] 
When José Guillén was acquired on August 13, Schierholtz was relegated 
to the role of pinch-hitter and late-inning defensive substitution for 
the rest of the year.[33][39] In 137 games (227 at bats), Schierholtz batted 
.242 with 55 hits, 13 doubles, three triples, three home runs, and 17 RBI.[4] 
Schierholtz received regular playing time throughout the postseason as 
a defensive replacement for starting outfielder Pat Burrell. Burrell was 
one of the best hitters on the Giants, but was a poor defender in the outfield.[40] 
Whenever the Giants held a lead in the sixth inning or later, Bochy would 
remove Burrell from the game, shift Cody Ross from right field to left 
field, and place Schierholtz in right field. This strategy was meant to 
provide the Giants with the best possible defensive outfield and, thus, 
the best chance of holding the lead and winning the game.[41][42][43] Schierholtz 
ultimately appeared in 11 of San Francisco's 15 playoff games, accumulating 
13 plate appearances and recording an RBI in Game 1 of the 2010 World Series 
against the Texas Rangers.[4] In Game 4, a night when Bochy chose to start 
several of his backups, he got his first start of the postseason, playing 
right field in the Giants' 4–0 victory.[44] The Giants won the World Series 
in five games, their first World Series victory since 1954.[45] Schierholtz 
hit a 467-foot home run at Coors Field on April 18, 2011, against Esmil 
Rogers in an 8–1 victory over the Rockies.[4][46] At the start of May, 
Schierholtz took over the Giants' right field job, due to a slump by Burrell.[47][48][49] 
He hit a game-tying, two-run pinch-hit home run against Grant Balfour on 
May 22 in an 11-inning, 5–4 victory over Oakland.[50] He had a game-tying 
RBI single in the ninth inning on June 1 against Fernando Salas and a game-winning 
RBI single in the 11th inning against Ryan Franklin in a 7–5 victory over 
the St. Louis Cardinals.[51] On July 6, against the San Diego Padres, Schierholtz 
recorded his first multi-home run game. In the bottom of the 14th inning 
of that game, he hit a walk-off home run against Pat Neshek that secured 
a 6-5 victory for the Giants.[52] Two days later, he had a splash hit home 
run against R.A. Dickey in a 5–2 loss to the New York Mets.[53] Following 
the acquisition of Carlos Beltrán on July 28, Schierholtz began playing 
some left field for the first time in his career.[4] He broke his right 
foot against the Atlanta Braves on August 15, appearing in five more games 
before the injury became too severe to play through. He was placed on the 
disabled list on August 27 (retroactive to August 22), and, though initially 
expected to return, he missed the rest of the season.[54][55] In 115 games 
(335 at bats), Schierholtz hit .278 with 93 hits, 22 doubles, nine home 
runs, and 41 RBI.[4] He said of his 2011 season, "I was able to contribute 
to the team this year. That was a positive thing I can take from the season."[55] 
In 2012, Schierholtz started the season as a bench player but soon became 
the Giants' everyday right fielder.[56] On April 23 and 24, he had back-to-back 
three-hit games against the Mets.[4] He batted .372 over his first 14 games 
but hit just .048 over his next seven. When May started, Bochy benched 
him in favor of Gregor Blanco.[56][57] On July 18, in an interview with 
Henry Schulman of the San Francisco Chronicle, he said that Bochy had told 
him in May that he did not view him as an everyday player. He said that, 
while he did not ask for a trade, ""I think whatever the best fit for the 
team and me is would be ideal. I can't really make those decisions. It's 
all up to them. Whether I'm here or not I'm going to give my best effort 
every day and bust my tail."[58] That weekend, he started three games against 
the Philadelphia Phillies in right field, partly because Blanco and Ángel 
Pagán had been struggling.[59] On July 22, Schierholtz hit two home runs 
against Joe Blanton, the second of which forced the game into extra innings. 
However, the Giants would lose 4–3 in 12 innings.[60] In 77 games (175 
at bats), Schierholtz hit .251 with 44 hits, four doubles, five triples, 
five home runs, and 16 RBI.[4] At the trade deadline on July 31, Schierholtz 
was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with minor league catcher 
Tommy Joseph and minor league pitcher Seth Rosin for outfielder Hunter 
Pence.[61] Upon Schierholtz's arrival in Philadelphia, manager Charlie 
Manuel said he wanted to give Schierholtz everyday playing time for the 
rest of the year, in order to assess him.[62] In the transition Schierholtz 
changed his number from 12 to 22.[63] In his debut, Schierholtz homered 
against Edwin Jackson in a 3–2 victory against the Washington Nationals.[64] 
However, Schierholtz was sent to the disabled list on August 13 after fracturing 
his right big toe.[62] He remained on the disabled list until September 
1.[65] On September 7, he delivered a game-ending RBI single against Will 
Harris, giving the Phillies a 3–2 win over Colorado.[66] Schierholtz appeared 
in 33 games with the Phillies, batting .273 with 18 hits, four doubles, 
one home run, and five RBI. In 114 games (241 at bats) with Philadelphia 
and San Francisco, he batted .257 with 62 hits, eight doubles, five triples, 
six home runs, and 21 RBI.[4] After the season, the Phillies non-tendered 
Schierholtz, making him a free agent. They chose to non-tender him because 
they were only projecting him as a fifth outfielder, and Schierholtz was 
due for a pay raise.[67][68] Despite being traded to the Phillies, Schierholtz 
received his second World Series ring from the Giants due to his contributions 
during the first half of the 2012 season with the team.[69] On December 
5, 2012, Schierholtz signed a $2.25 million, one-year deal with the Chicago 
Cubs.[68][70] He was the Cubs' starting right fielder for most of the 2013 
season. From June 4 through 18, he set a career-high with a 10-game hitting 
streak.[4] On June 14, he had two triples in a game for the first time 
in his career in a 14-inning, 6–5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.[71] 
On June 22, he set a career-high with his 10th home run of the season in 
a 4–3 loss to the Houston Astros.[72] He batted .286 with 11 home runs 
through June 30 but saw his average sink to .218 for the rest of the season, 
although he would hit 10 home runs.[73] On July 24, he had a career-high 
five RBI, including a game-winning RBI double against David Hernandez in 
the 12th inning of a 7–6 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.[74] Three 
days later, he hit a home run against Sergio Romo in a 1–0 victory over 
the Giants.[75] Schierholtz reset his career-high in RBI with six on August 
19, including home runs against Jordan Zimmermann and Fernando Abad in 
an 11–1 victory over the Washington Nationals.[76] In 137 games (462 at 
bats), Schierholtz batted .251 with career-highs in hits (116), doubles 
(32), home runs (21), runs scored (56), and RBI (68). Defensively, he posted 
a .988 fielding percentage.[4] On January 17, 2014, Schierholtz signed 
a $5 million, one-year deal to remain with the Chicago Cubs.[77] On June 
3, he had a game-ending RBI single against Scott Rice, giving the Cubs 
a 2–1 victory over the Mets.[78] He was designated for assignment by the 
Cubs on August 6, 2014.[79] Chicago released the veteran on waivers after 
he had a .192 batting average and six home runs over 99 games.[63] On August 
18, 2014, Schierholtz signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals, 
and was assigned to the AAA Syracuse Chiefs.[80] The Nationals selected 
Schierholtz's contract on August 23 and used him as a reserve outfielder.[81] 
On September 21, he tripled home a run against Nate Eovaldi, then scored 
on a double by Anthony Rendon in a 2–1 victory over the Miami Marlins.[82] 
In 23 games (40 at bats) with the Nationals, Schierholtz batted .225 with 
one home run. His combined totals were a .195 average, 69 hits, seven home 
runs, and 37 RBI in 122 games with Chicago and Washington.[63] Schierholtz 
reached the playoffs with Washington as they won the National League East 
Division.[83] He appeared in all four games of the series, getting a hit 
in his only at bat for a 1.000 batting average as the Nationals were defeated 
by the Giants. After the season, he became a free agent.[63] On February 
6, 2015, Schierholtz signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers.[84] 
On March 28, 2015, Schierholtz was released by the Rangers.[85] During 
the 2015 season, Schierholtz hit .250 (58-for-232), with 10 home runs and 
30 RBIs in 65 games for Hiroshima Toyo Carp of Nippon Professional Baseball 
(NPB). On December 23, 2015, Schierholtz signed a minor league contract 
with the Detroit Tigers, and was invited to spring training.[86] He was 
released on May 22, 2016. Schierholtz married Kate Eveland, a former guard 
on the San Diego State basketball team on December 3, 2011.[87] He is the 
son of Vai, Sr., and Karen Schierholtz and the oldest of four children 
(Cainan; Vai, Jr.; and Sophia).[88] Cainan, his younger brother, was arrested 
on a DUI in 2004 and was charged with another DUI and felony hit-and-run 
on August 1, 2010. Nate said, "Obviously, it's very upsetting... It's just 
something very irresponsible and he's going to have to do some decent time 
for what he's done. I'll stick by him and support him to get the counseling 
he needs."[89] Vai, Jr., his youngest brother, attended the Air Force Academy 
and played baseball for the Falcons.[88] His mother lives in Alamo, California; 
her house burned down in 2009 but was rebuilt.[89] Schierholtz used to 
bat without batting gloves, one of the few Major Leaguers to do so,[4] 
but since 2011 has used batting gloves.[90] On August 5, 2016, Schierholtz 
received an 80 game suspension from Major League Baseball for testing positive
