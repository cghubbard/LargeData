Willy Taveras (born December 25, 1981) is a Dominican professional baseball 
player for the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican Baseball League. A center 
fielder, Taveras has played in Major League Baseball for the Houston Astros, 
Colorado Rockies, Cincinnati Reds, and Washington Nationals Taveras played 
in 10 games at the end of the 2004 Astros season, mostly as a pinch runner. 
In 2005, he led the majors in infield hits (71), bunt hits (31), and singles 
(152), and was tops among rookies in runs (82), hits (172), and stolen 
bases (34; 6th in the NL). He hit .291. Taveras was the Astros' starting 
center fielder during his rookie season (2005), replacing Carlos Beltrán, 
who signed with the New York Mets in the offseason. In Game 4 of the 2005 
NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals, he made a catch while running up 
Tal's Hill in Minute Maid Park's deep center field to end the 8th inning 
and preserve a 2-1 lead. He scored the winning run as a pinch-runner the 
inning before on a short sacrifice fly to center field. After the season, 
Taveras was voted National League Rookie of the Year by the players (Ryan 
Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies won the actual Rookie of the Year Award).[citation 
needed] In 2006, Taveras' batting average regressed to .278, though he 
again led the majors in bunt hits (21) and had 33 stolen bases (10th in 
the NL), but just 30 RBI. Taveras had a 30-game hitting streak that ended 
August 29, 2006, during a game in which he was hit twice by Milwaukee Brewers 
pitcher Tomo Ohka. His streak is a franchise record, breaking the record 
of 25 previously held by Jeff Kent. He is the 42nd player in MLB history 
with a hit streak of 30-or-more games. On December 12, 2006, Taveras was 
traded along with Taylor Buchholz and Jason Hirsh by the Astros to the 
Colorado Rockies for Rockies pitchers Jason Jennings and Miguel Asencio. 
In 2007, Taveras hit .320, including an MLB leading 27 bunt singles, 2 
home runs, 24 RBIs, 33 stolen bases, and caught stealing 9 times. He was 
part of the World Series roster after making a big play in the NLCS vs 
the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Rockies were swept by the Red Sox. In a 22-inning 
game played between April 17–18, 2008, at Petco Park, Taveras set a Rockies' 
club record with 10 at-bats in the game. He led MLB with 68 stolen bases 
during the 2008 season, [1] and led the NL with 24 bunt hits. [2] At the 
same time, his .296 slugging percentage was the lowest in the majors. [3] 
Defensively, however, he had the lowest fielding percentage of all major 
league center fielders, .976. [4] On December 12, 2008, the Rockies non-tendered 
Taveras, making him a free agent.[1] On December 27, 2008, Taveras signed 
a two-year deal worth $6.25 million with the Cincinnati Reds.[2] In his 
debut with the Reds, he hit a pinch-hit triple in the 8th inning after 
being down with the flu for over a week. In 2009, Taveras had the lowest 
slugging percentage, .285, and the lowest on-base percentage, .275, of 
all National League players with at least 350 plate appearances. On February 
1, 2010, Taveras was traded along with Adam Rosales to the Oakland Athletics 
for Aaron Miles and a player to be named later. He was later designated 
for assignment by Oakland. Taveras declined a Triple-A assignment and was 
granted free agency. On February 15, 2010, Taveras signed a minor league 
contract with the Washington Nationals with an invite to spring training. 
He played 27 games, and on May 21, 2010 he was granted his unconditional 
release. On June 3, 2010, he signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[3] He was assigned to Triple-A Lehigh Valley. On June 29, 2010, 
he was released after playing 23 games for the IronPigs, batting .208 in 
96 AB's, with nine stolen bases. On August 15, 2010, Taveras signed a minor 
league deal with the Texas Rangers. On January 25, 2011, Taveras signed 
a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies. He spent the 2011 season 
with the Rockies Triple-A affiliate Colorado Springs Sky Sox, batting .308 
in 97 games with a .336 on-base percentage.[4] Due to problems with the 
sports agency that formerly represented him Taveras was out of American 
baseball for the entire 2012 season.[4] On December 11, 2012, Taveras was 
signed to a minor league contract by the Kansas City Royals with an invitation 
to spring training.[4] At the time of the signing Taveras was playing baseball 
in the Mexican League with Yaquis de Obregón.[4] Taveras signed with the 
Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball for 
the 2015 season. This is Taveras first year in Independent Baseball. On 
April 11, 2016, Taveras signed with the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican 
Baseball League. Taveras has good skills for slap-hitting; however, he 
strikes out frequently (103 times in 2005) and rarely walks. His career-high 
in walks is 36, resulting in a low on-base percentage. In addition, Taveras 
is an exceptionally poor power hitter, producing the lowest slugging percentage 
among all regular major league outfielders for both the 2005 and 2006 seasons. 
He has great speed and has been clocked at 3.57 seconds from home to first 
as a right-handed hitter. Taveras has also led the league in infield singles,
