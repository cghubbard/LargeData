John Scott "Jack" Morris (born May 16, 1955) is an American former professional 
baseball starting pitcher, and played between 1977 and 1994, mainly for 
the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB), winning 254 games throughout 
his career. Armed with a fastball, a slider, and a forkball,[1][2] Morris 
was a five-time All-Star (1981, 1984, 1985, 1987, and 1991), and played 
on four World Series Championship teams (1984 Tigers, 1991 Minnesota Twins, 
and 1992–1993 Toronto Blue Jays). While he gave up the most hits, most 
earned runs, and most home runs of any pitcher in the 1980s,[3] he also 
started the most games, pitched the most innings, and had the most wins 
of any pitcher in that decade.[4] Since retiring as a player, Morris has 
worked as a broadcast color analyst for the Blue Jays, Twins, and Tigers. 
He has also been an analyst for MLB broadcasts on Fox Sports One. Morris 
attended Brigham Young University[5] and was drafted by the Tigers in the 
fifth round of the 1976 draft.[6] He was first called up to the Detroit 
Tigers in 1977 after Mark Fidrych was placed on the disabled list with 
an injury. Morris broke into the Tigers' pitching rotation in 1979, posting 
a 17–7 record and a 3.29 ERA and establishing himself as the ace of the 
Detroit staff. Morris, along with catcher Lance Parrish, shortstop Alan 
Trammell, second baseman Lou Whitaker, outfielder Kirk Gibson, and manager 
Sparky Anderson, played a notable role in turning the Tigers into a contending 
team for most of the 1980s. In 1980, Morris learned to throw the split-finger 
fastball from newly hired pitching coach Roger Craig, and it became an 
effective pitch for the rest of Morris' career. Despite playing for the 
notorious "Captain Hook" (Anderson),[7] so named because of his tendency 
to pull his starters at the first sign of weakness, Morris was known for 
finishing what he started. He racked up 175 complete games in his career 
(154 with Detroit). In 10 of his 12 full seasons as a Tiger, he compiled 
double-digit complete game totals. In 1983 alone, Jack completed 20 of 
his 37 starts. That year, he led the league in innings pitched (293.2), 
batters faced (1204) and strikeouts (232), while posting his first 20-win 
season.[8] On April 7, 1984 (on NBC's nationally televised Game of the 
Week), Morris no-hit the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park,[9] beginning 
what would be an excellent season for both him and the Tigers. The no-hitter 
was the first by a Tiger since Jim Bunning in 1958. By the end of the 1984 
campaign, he had notched 19 wins and a 3.60 ERA, leading Detroit into the 
postseason. He scored a win over the Kansas City Royals in the ALCS, and 
added two more complete-game victories in the World Series against the 
San Diego Padres as the Tigers concluded their wire-to-wire 1984 campaign 
with the World Championship. While teammate Alan Trammell was named the 
World Series MVP, Jack was given the Babe Ruth Award for most outstanding 
performance in the 1984 postseason. In 1986, Morris racked up 21 wins, 
and had a stretch from July 9–18 in which he threw three consecutive complete 
game shutouts.[10] But he was overshadowed that year by eventual Cy Young 
Award winner Roger Clemens of the Boston Red Sox, who went 24–4. The Tigers 
headed to the postseason again in 1987 behind a team-leading 18 wins from 
Morris, but this time Jack's postseason performance was below expectations 
as Detroit lost the ALCS to the eventual World Champion Minnesota Twins. 
Despite a sub par season in 1989 when he made only 24 starts and won just 
6 games, he still finished the 1980s with 162 wins, the most by a major 
league pitcher during the decade. In 1990, his final season in Detroit, 
Morris lost a career high 18 games, though he also led the Tiger staff 
with 15 wins. Morris had a 3–1 post-season record as a Tiger, with a 2.73 
ERA. When playing for the Tigers, Morris was approached for a locker room 
interview by Jennifer Frey. At the time, Frey was an intern with the Miami 
Herald; she would later work as a reporter for The New York Times and The 
Washington Post. Morris responded to Frey that, "I don’t talk to women 
when I’m naked unless they’re on top of me or I’m on top of them". When 
the Herald complained about his actions, Bo Schembechler, who was the president 
of the Tigers at the time, said that the newspaper had a "lack of common 
sense" for assigning a woman to the interview. In 1991, Morris signed a 
one-year contract with his hometown Minnesota Twins. He enjoyed another 
great season, posting 18 wins with a 3.43 ERA, and an even better postseason 
after Minnesota won the AL West. Morris won both of his starts over the 
Toronto Blue Jays in the ALCS, and his team went on to face the Atlanta 
Braves in the World Series. Jack started for the Twins three times in the 
series, going 2-0 with a 1.17 ERA, making his final outing in the deciding 
Game 7. In a postseason performance for the ages, the 36-year-old hurler 
threw 10 innings of shutout baseball against the Braves, as the Twins won 
the World title on a 10th-inning single by Gene Larkin that scored Dan 
Gladden. Morris was named the World Series MVP for his fantastic performance, 
and joined fellow pitcher Sandy Koufax as the only players to win the Babe 
Ruth Award twice. He holds the record for most wins by a Twin in a single 
postseason, with four acquired in 1991. Following the 1991 season, Morris 
signed with the Toronto Blue Jays. He earned 21 wins for the second time 
in his career (achieving the first ever 20-win season for a Blue Jays pitcher), 
though he rode the wave of superior run support from his offense, given 
his 4.04 ERA that year. The Blue Jays reached the 1992 World Series against 
the Braves. Despite a subpar post-season performance (he went 0-3, including 
2 World Series losses), Morris won a third World Series ring as Toronto 
beat Atlanta in six games. He won a fourth ring in 1993, as the Blue Jays 
repeated as World Champions with a victory over the Philadelphia Phillies 
in six games. However, Morris was not an important factor in the Blue Jays 
World Series repeat: he pitched poorly for the team in the regular season, 
finishing 7-12 with a 6.19 ERA, and was not used at all in the postseason 
due to a season-ending injury.[11] On Tuesday, April 6, 1993, Morris set 
a major league record by making his 14th consecutive opening day start, 
an impressive achievement since he played on numerous title-contending 
teams. The opening day start is usually given to either the best pitcher 
in the rotation or the pitcher with the highest level of respect among 
the players and coaches. He joined the Cleveland Indians in 1994, but was 
released by the team on August 9, three days before the season was ended 
by a strike. Morris finished the season with a 10-6 record, but an ERA 
of 5.60. After an abortive attempt at a comeback with the Cincinnati Reds 
during spring training of 1995, Morris retired. In 1996, however, he made 
a brief return to professional baseball, this time playing with the St. 
Paul Saints of the independent Northern League. The 41-year-old Morris 
went 5-1 in 10 starts, with a 2.69 ERA, before retiring for good. Morris 
was the highest-paid pitcher in the American League on at least 4 occasions: 
1987, 1988, 1991, and 1993. Although it likely helped his strikeout totals, 
the split-finger pitch was also responsible for Morris leading the league 
in wild pitches on six separate occasions. His 206 wild pitches in his 
career rank eighth in baseball history. Morris has spent time as a color 
analyst for the Minnesota Twins. He also spent time in Lakeland, Florida 
as a part-time coach for the Detroit Tigers during spring training. In 
2013, Morris joined Sportsnet as a color analyst for Toronto Blue Jays 
radio broadcasts, as well as making appearances on television broadcasts.[15] 
In 2014, served as a pre- and post-game analyst for Twins telecasts on 
Fox Sports North (as well as a part-time substitute for regular game analyst 
Bert Blyleven) and as a regular on-air contributor on KTWN-FM and the Twins 
Radio Network.[16] On February 10, 2015, it was announced that Morris was 
hired as a part-time analyst for Detroit Tigers telecasts on Fox Sports 
Detroit, along with former teammate Kirk Gibson.[17] In a unique arrangement, 
Morris continued to work part-time for the Twins' television crew as well 
as the Tigers'.[18] Morris is known for his love of hunting and fishing, 
especially in his native Minnesota. Morris has been eligible for the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame since 2000. From 2000 to 2003, he never received 
greater than 30% of the vote. He received 40% of the vote for the first 
time in 2006. In 2010, he received 52.3% of the vote.[8][19] In 2012, he 
received 67% of the vote, and in 2013 he received 67.7% of the vote.[20] 
On January 8, 2014, Morris only received 61.5% of the vote in his last 
year of eligibility, and can now be considered for the Veterans Committee
