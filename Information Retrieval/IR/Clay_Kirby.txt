Clayton Laws Kirby, Jr. (June 25, 1948 – October 11, 1991) was a Major 
League Baseball (MLB) pitcher for the San Diego Padres (1969–73), Cincinnati 
Reds (1974–75) and Montreal Expos (1976). Clayton Laws "Clay" Kirby, Jr, 
was born in Washington, D.C. and attended Washington-Lee High School in 
Arlington, Virginia.[1] He was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 
third round of the 1966 draft, however, in October 1968 he was chosen in 
the expansion draft by the Padres, who would begin play in 1969 along with 
the Expos.[2] He made his Major League debut at age 20 with the first-year 
Padres on April 11, 1969 as the Padres fell at home 8-0 to the San Francisco 
Giants. The first major league hitter he ever faced was Willie Mays, who 
walked, as Kirby gave up three earned runs in four innings.[3] Although 
he led the National League in losses that year with 20 (and seven wins), 
he had a 3.80 earned run average in 35 starts with 215.1 innings pitched.[2] 
On July 21, 1970, Kirby was working on a no-hitter against the New York 
Mets after eight innings, but trailed 1-0 as the Mets scored in the first 
inning after a walk to Tommie Agee. Agee stole second base. Bud Harrelson 
popped up to the shortstop Kirby walked Ken Singleton, and the Mets did 
a double steal. Agee was now on third, Singleton was on second and Art 
Shamsky was the batter. He hit a ground ball to second baseman Ron Slocum, 
who threw him out as Agee scored.[4] With two outs, Manager Preston Gómez 
had Cito Gaston pinch-hit for him in the bottom of the eighth, denying 
him a chance to complete the no-hitter. The 10,373 fans in attendance booed 
long and loud. Relief pitcher Jack Baldschun then gave up two runs and 
three hits in the ninth. Mets Jim McAndrew had retired 15 batters in a 
row en route to what would be a three-hit, 3-0 victory for the Mets. According 
to Mets pitcher Tom Seaver. “The Mets bench just gasped in disbelief,” 
Seaver told sportswriter Joe Durso. "I personally would have let him hit. 
If the pennant race were involved, no. But in this situation, yes.”[5][6][7] 
That season, Kirby posted a 10-16 record with a 4.53 ERA. The next two 
years Kirby had numbers of 15-13, 2.83 (with 13 complete games) in 1971 
and 12-14, 3.13 in 1972. In 1973 his record fell to 8-18 with a 4.79 ERA.[2] 
In November 1973 Kirby was traded to the Reds and the move paid off for 
both as Kirby went 12-9 with an ERA of 3.28. In 1975 he was one of six 
starters for the Big Red Machine, who won the National League title as 
he went 10-6 with an ERA of 4.72 in 19 starts. The Reds later won the 1975 
World Series, but Kirby did not play in the series.[8]/CIN/1975.shtml In 
December 1975 he was traded to the Expos, for infielder Bob Bailey. In 
January 1976 Kirby was stricken with a long bout of pneumonia before he 
joined the Expos in Florida for spring training. He was still weak and 
had a sore shoulder when the season opened. He got off to a miserable start 
and never recovered and in the 1976 season he fell to 1-8 with an ERA of 
5.72, and it was his final major league season. Montreal released him on 
December 2, 1976. In January 1977 the Padres picked up their former pitcher 
to give him another chance. They invited him to their spring-training camp 
in Yuma, Arizona. A knee injury in the final week of spring training delayed 
his comeback try for almost two months. The Padres placed him in their 
Pacific Coast League farm club in Hawaii. He won his first game for the 
Islanders on June 18, but never won another. His record for the season 
was one win, seven losses, and an earned-run average of 7.95. After San 
Diego gave up on Kirby, he tried out with the Minnesota Twins during spring 
training in 1978. He lasted only two weeks before he was released. Kirby 
was out of Organized Baseball before his 30th birthday. In his eight seasons 
in the Major Leagues, Kirby played 261 games (239 started) and had a 75–104 
record with a 3.84 ERA, 42 complete games, eight shutouts, 1,548 innings 
pitched and 1,061 strikeouts.[2] Following his baseball career, Kirby was 
acting tournament chairman for the annual Major League Baseball Players 
Alumni (MLBPA) Washington Metropolitan Area Charity Golf Tournament. The 
event, which benefited the American Lung Association, was part of the "Swing 
With the Legends Golf Series."[1] His family continued to live in San Diego 
County until 1983, when they returned to Virginia. Kirby became a self-employed 
financial securities broker. On July 19, 1991, Kirby underwent a coronary 
Atherectomy to open a blockage in an artery just above his heart. After 
the procedure he was told he had suffered a silent heart attack. Kirby 
had been complaining about chest discomfort and numbness in his arm. He 
died of a heart attack on October 11, 1991, at the age of 43. His wife 
found him about 11 o’clock in the morning in his chair. It appeared that 
he had fallen asleep while reading and suffered the fatal attack. He was 
survived by his wife, Susan; his mother, Gloria; his sister, Carolyn Twyman; 
his son, Clayton; his daughter, Theresa Schoengold; and two grandchildren, 
Derek and Brandon Schoengold. He was buried in the National Memorial Park
