Albertín Aroldis Chapman de la Cruz (Spanish: [aˈɾoldis ˈtʃapman]; born 
February 28, 1988[2]) is a Cuban professional baseball pitcher who is a 
free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cincinnati 
Reds, New York Yankees and Chicago Cubs and for Holguín in the Cuban National 
Series. Chapman bats and throws left-handed, and is nicknamed the Cuban 
Missile or the Cuban Flame Thrower. Chapman pitched for Holguín domestically 
and internationally for the Cuban national baseball team. He defected from 
Cuba in 2009 and signed a contract with the Reds in 2010. Chapman made 
his MLB debut that season. He won the MLB Delivery Man of the Month Award 
as the best relief pitcher for July 2012, and has been named to four straight 
National League All-Star teams from 2012 to 2015. The Reds traded Chapman 
to the Yankees after the 2015 season, and the Yankees traded Chapman to 
the Cubs during the 2016 season. Chapman holds the record for the fastest 
recorded pitch speed in MLB history at 105.1 mph (169.1 km/h)[1] as well 
as the Guinness World Record for fastest baseball pitch for a male.[3] 
On July 11, 2014, Chapman broke the record, previously held by Bruce Sutter, 
for the most consecutive relief appearances with a strikeout, having struck 
out at least one batter in 40 consecutive appearances. Chapman's streak 
began on August 21, 2013,[4] and lasted 49 consecutive games over two seasons, 
with the 49th and final game being on August 13, 2014. Chapman was born 
in Holguín, Cuba, on February 28, 1988. He lived in a three-room house 
with his parents and two sisters. His father, a boxing trainer, taught 
Aroldis to box.[5] A friend of Chapman invited him to join a local baseball 
team at the age of 15. He began playing as a first baseman until the coach 
noticed that Chapman could throw well enough to become a pitcher, which 
Chapman began in 2003.[5] Chapman joined the Holguín Sabuesos of the Cuban 
National Series League in 2006.[5] In 327 2⁄3 career innings, Chapman compiled 
a 24–19 win–loss record, a 3.74 earned run average (ERA), and 365 strikeouts. 
He was used mainly as a starting pitcher, although he made 11 relief appearances 
in the 2007 season.[6] Chapman was part of the Cuban national team at the 
2007 Pan American Games and the 2009 World Baseball Classic. After a failed 
attempt to defect in the spring of 2008, Chapman reported to Havana to 
meet with Cuban President Raúl Castro who gave him a conditional reprieve, 
suspending him for the remainder of the National Series season and also 
keeping him off Cuba's national team for the 2008 Summer Olympics but allowing 
him to return to the National Series and play in the WBC in 2009.[7] Chapman 
successfully defected from Cuba while in Rotterdam, Netherlands where the 
Cuban national team was participating in the World Port Tournament on July 
1, 2009; Chapman walked out the front door of the team hotel and entered 
into an automobile driven by an acquaintance.[7][8] Gerardo Concepción 
defected from the Cuban national team in the same tournament.[9] Chapman 
eventually established residency in Andorra[10] and petitioned the MLB 
to be granted free agent status.[11] On January 10, 2010, Chapman agreed 
to a long-term contract with the Cincinnati Reds.[12] The Reds announced 
that they had signed Chapman to a six-year contract, worth $30.25 million 
according to MLB sources.[13] The Associated Press reported that the bonus 
totals $16.25 million, paid annually over 11 years, with an additional 
bonus if he became eligible for salary arbitration in 2012 or 2013.[14] 
Chapman began the 2010 season assigned to the Triple-A Louisville Bats,[15] 
and made his professional debut with the Louisville Bats on Sunday, April 
11, in Toledo against the Mud Hens, where he pitched 4 2⁄3 innings, giving 
up 1 unearned run, while striking out 9.[16] Chapman made 13 starts with 
Louisville, pitching to a 4.11 ERA, and pitched to a 2.40 ERA after the 
team used him as a relief pitcher.[5] Chapman made his Major League debut 
August 31, 2010, in the eighth inning against the Milwaukee Brewers; his 
first pitch was clocked at 98 mph (158 km/h) as a called strike (which 
was promptly tossed to the dugout by catcher Ryan Hanigan, to be saved). 
In nine pitches he retired the side.[17][18] He recorded his first Major 
League win on September 1 after pitching an inning of relief against the 
Brewers.[19] Aroldis Chapman threw the fastest pitch recognized by MLB 
on September 24, 2010 at Petco Park in San Diego, California . It was clocked 
at 105.1 mph to Tony Gwynn, Jr. in the eighth inning. [1] In Game 2 of 
the 2010 NLDS vs the Philadelphia Phillies, Chapman allowed 3 runs (all 
unearned) due to miscues of the outfielders. Chapman would get his first 
career postseason loss and the Reds would lose the division series to the 
Phillies in a three-game sweep. Chapman served solely as a relief pitcher 
in 2011, appearing in 54 regular season games and finishing the season 
with a 3.60 ERA. He also struck out 71 batters in just 50.0 innings of 
work that season. Chapman was due to be introduced as a starter for the 
2012 season, but preseason injuries to closer Ryan Madson and middle relievers 
Bill Bray and Nick Masset led manager Dusty Baker to put Chapman in the 
setup role.[20] Interim closer Sean Marshall struggled early in the season, 
and Chapman was given the closer role in late May.[21] On July 1, 2012 
Chapman was named to his first All-Star Game.[22] Chapman won the MLB Delivery 
Man of the Month Award for July 2012, in which he recorded 13 saves while 
not allowing a run in 14 1⁄3 innings while striking out 31 batters — more 
than 60% of the batters he faced.[23][24] It was the third month of the 
season in which he did not allow a single run. He was named the August 
Delivery Man of the Month as well.[25] Chapman finished the 2012 season 
with a 1.51 ERA and 38 saves in 43 chances, recording 122 strikeouts and 
23 walks in 71 2⁄3 innings.[26] In March 2013, it was announced that Chapman 
would be the closer for the Cincinnati Reds.[27] He was an All-Star selection 
for the second season in a row. He finished the 2013 year with 38 saves- 
a 4-5 record, 112 strikeouts, and a 2.54 ERA. During a spring training 
game against the Kansas City Royals on March 19, 2014, Chapman was struck 
in the head by a line drive from Salvador Perez.[28] The spring-training 
game between the Reds and the Royals was ended at that point with Kansas 
City leading 8-3. Chapman underwent surgery to fix a skull fracture above 
his left eye. A metal plate was inserted into his head to stabilize the 
fracture. Chapman began the 2014 season on the 15-day disabled list. On 
April 18, Chapman was cleared to begin throwing batting practice sessions. 
Reds manager Bryan Price said that he wasn't sure when Chapman would throw 
but said it likely would be during the team's 10-game trip that ended April 
27.[29] He was activated from the disabled list on May 10.[30] Chapman 
recorded his 100th save against the Arizona Diamondbacks on July 29, 2014, 
becoming the eighth fastest pitcher to reach the milestone.[31] In the 
20-pitch appearance, Chapman threw 15 fastballs, all of which were above 
100 mph.[32] In 54 appearances, Chapman produced 106 strikeouts with 36 
saves going 0-3 with an ERA of exactly 2.00. Chapman and the Reds agreed 
to a one-year, $8.05 million contract on February 13, 2015.[33] Chapman 
was selected to the 2015 MLB All-Star Game. He pitched a scoreless ninth 
inning and struck out the side on 14 pitches, 12 of which were recorded 
at 100 mph or greater.[34] In the 2015 year, Chapman made 65 relief appearances 
with a 4-4 record, a 1.63 ERA, and 33 saves. On December 28, 2015, Chapman 
was traded to the New York Yankees. Cincinnati received four minor league 
players including right-handed pitchers Caleb Cotham and Rookie Davis, 
and infielders Eric Jagielo and Tony Renda in the exchange.[35] On January 
11, 2016, manager Joe Girardi named Chapman the team's new closer.[36] 
He avoided arbitration on February 12, 2016, by agreeing to a one-year 
contract worth $11.325 million.[37] Chapman was suspended for the first 
30 games of the season due to an off-season personal conduct policy violation 
related to domestic violence.[38] He made his first appearance for the 
Yankees on May 9, 2016 striking out 2 and allowing a run as the Yankees 
won 6-3 over the Kansas City Royals. On July 18 against the Orioles, Chapman 
threw for 105 mph twice in the top of the ninth inning, averaging 103.2 mph 
with his fastball.[39] On July 25, 2016, the Yankees traded Chapman to 
the Chicago Cubs for Gleyber Torres, Billy McKinney, Adam Warren, and Rashad 
Crawford. In an interview with ESPN, Chapman stated he was thrilled that 
the Cubs went after him, especially considering the recent success of Héctor 
Rondón. Chapman made his first appearance as a member of the Cubs on July 
27, pitching a 1-2-3 ninth and striking out two batters in a non-save situation.[40] 
Chapman made 3 saves in 4 save opportunities in the NLDS against the San 
Francisco Giants to set new Division Series records for each. On October 
22, 2016, Chapman pitched through two innings, and pitched the final two 
outs on a double play in the bottom of the ninth inning against the Los 
Angeles Dodgers to push the Cubs to the 2016 World Series; the franchise's 
first World Series appearance since 1945. On October 30, 2016, Chapman 
pitched through the 7th, 8th, and 9th innings in Game 5 of the 2016 World 
Series, defending the Cubs' 3–2 lead over the Cleveland Indians.[41] With 
a three-quarters delivery, Chapman currently throws three pitches: a four-seam 
fastball averaging 99–100 miles per hour (159–161 km/h), a slider averaging 
87–88 miles per hour (140–142 km/h), and an occasional change-up.[42][43] 
Chapman's fastball averaged 100.3 miles per hour (161.4 km/h) in 2010, 
but that declined to 98.6 miles per hour (158.7 km/h) in 2011 and 97.8 
miles per hour (157.4 km/h) through August 2012.[43] This more modest speed 
may be part of an attempt to better control his fastball.[44] By 2015, 
Chapman's fastball averaged 99.98 miles per hour (160.90 km/h). That same 
year, Statcast revealed that Chapman threw the 62 fastest pitches of the 
season, topping out at 103.92 miles per hour (167.24 km/h).[45] Both pitches 
have extraordinarily high whiff rates of 33% for the fastball and 58% for 
the slider. These have given Chapman a career strikeouts per nine innings 
rate of 14.66 as of August 2012[update], second all-time to Craig Kimbrel, 
and the third-highest career percentage of pitches for swinging strikes 
(16.5%).[46] Scouts worried about his control issues and lack of a solid 
third pitch, noting that these issues could affect his ability to be a 
Major League starter.[47] However, Chapman's control seems to have improved.[48] 
After issuing 41 walks in 50 innings the previous season, Chapman only 
walked 23 batters in 2012 over 71 2⁄3 innings.[49] According to MLB scouts,[50] 
Chapman's fastball has been clocked as high as 105 mph (169 km/h) (during 
the 2010 minor league season).[51] On September 24, 2010, against the San 
Diego Padres, Chapman was clocked at 105.1 mph (169.1 km/h), according 
to PITCHf/x, which is the fastest pitch ever recorded in Major League Baseball.[52] 
On July 19, 2016, Chapman matched his previous record of 105.1 mph when 
he threw a ball to Baltimore's J.J. Hardy.[53] On April 18, 2011, Chapman 
threw a pitch to Pittsburgh's Andrew McCutchen that the scoreboard at Great 
American Ball Park clocked at a speed of 106 mph (170.6 km/h), although 
the box on Fox Sports Ohio's broadcast listed it at 105 mph (169 km/h) 
and the PITCHf/x system calculated a release speed of 102.4 mph (164.8 km/h). 
The disparity between these speeds has been widely discussed and questioned.[54] 
Sports Illustrated writer Joe Posnanski described Chapman thus: "There 
is no violence at all in his motion; he's like the anti-Bob Gibson in that 
way. Just a slow beginning, a fluid motion, and BLAMMO the ball just fires 
out like the Batmobile rolling out of the cave."[55] One scout noted that 
although "[t]here are no obvious flaws in Chapman's delivery ... Chapman 
has to coordinate a lot of moving parts," which may limit his consistency. 
Chapman's extreme pitch speed may also pose an injury risk to his pitching 
arm over time.[56] When Chapman defected, he left his father, mother, two 
sisters,[7] girlfriend, Raidelmis Mendosa Santiestelas, and newborn baby, 
Ashanty Brianna.[57] He would later be reunited with them when he helped 
them defect, the details of how they defected remain confidential.[58] 
On June 30, 2014, his son, Atticus Gabriel Chapman, was born in Cincinnati, 
Ohio. In May 2012, it was reported that Chapman was being sued after he 
allegedly served as "an informant for Cuban state authorities after a failed 
defection attempt and helped turn in another man in order to get back on 
the country's national baseball team."[59] On December 7, 2015, news broke 
that he was involved in an alleged domestic violence incident with his 
girlfriend in Davie, Florida at Chapman's home on October 30, 2015.[60] 
A pending trade with the Los Angeles Dodgers was put on hold as MLB announced 
it would be investigating the incident as part of its domestic violence 
policy.[61] In the incident, he was accused of choking his girlfriend and 
firing eight gunshots. No charges were filed by the police, and his attorney 
issued a statement denying the allegations.[62] The trade was rescinded 
and the Reds traded Chapman to the Yankees three weeks later. Although 
he was not charged due to inconsistency in his girlfriend's reports and 
lack of physical evidence, the MLB banned him for 30 games as a result 
of "Chapman's use of the firearm and its effect on his partner," ending 
May 9, 2016. He was the first player disciplined by new rules enacted in 
August 2015, which allows the MLB to ban a player from games without a
