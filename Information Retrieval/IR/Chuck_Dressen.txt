As player As manager As coach Charles Walter Dressen (September 20, 1894[1] 
– August 10, 1966), known as both "Chuck" and "Charlie", was an American 
third baseman, manager and coach in professional baseball during a career 
that lasted almost fifty years, and was best known as the manager of the 
powerful Brooklyn Dodgers of 1951–53. Indeed, Dressen's "schooling" of 
a young baseball writer is one of the most colorful themes in Roger Kahn's 
classic memoir, The Boys of Summer. Dressen was a veteran baseball man 
when he took the reins in Brooklyn after the 1950 season. Born in Decatur, 
Illinois, he threw and batted right-handed and was listed at 5 feet 5 inches 
(1.65 m) tall and 145 pounds (66 kg). Despite his small stature, Dressen 
also played professional football during his apprenticeship as a minor 
league baseball player. He was a quarterback for the Decatur Staleys (a 
forerunner of the Chicago Bears) in 1920 and the Racine Legion in 1922–23. 
After he turned to baseball full-time in 1924, Dressen batted .346 in the 
top-level American Association, paving the way for his 646-game Major League 
Baseball playing career. Dressen played for the Cincinnati Reds from 1925–31, 
and was the club's starting third baseman from 1926–29. He also was a late-season 
utilityman for the 1933 New York Giants. All told, he batted .272 with 
603 hits in the majors. Dressen began his managerial career in 1932 with 
the Nashville Vols of the Southern Association. He interrupted that assignment 
late in 1933 to fill in as a player for the Giants during the pennant drive. 
Although he didn't play during the 1933 World Series, he helped the Giants 
win Game 4. With New York leading the game by a single run in the bottom 
of the 11th inning, the opposition Washington Senators loaded the bases 
with one out, and sent up rookie pinch hitter Cliff Bolton. On his own 
initiative, Dressen called time, ran from the dugout, and advised Giants' 
first baseman and player-manager Bill Terry how to pitch and defend Bolton, 
whom Dressen knew from managing against him in the Southern Association. 
Bolton promptly bounced into a double play and the New Yorkers won the 
game to take a 3–1 lead in the Series, which they ultimately won in five 
games. The incident stamped Dressen as a potential major league manager.[2][3] 
After returning to Nashville at the outset of 1934 to resume his successful 
minor league managerial career, Dressen was called to Cincinnati to manage 
the last-place Reds on July 29, 1934.[4] The Reds rose as high as fifth 
place under him, in 1936, but when they fell back into the National League 
basement the following season, Dressen was fired.[5] Despite his poor won-lost 
record (214–282, .431) in Cincinnati, Dressen made a valuable ally in the 
Reds’ mercurial general manager, Larry MacPhail. A year after MacPhail 
became president of the Dodgers in 1938, he named fiery shortstop Leo Durocher 
player-manager and Dressen as his third base coach. Under MacPhail and 
Durocher, the Dodgers became a hard-playing pennant contender, winning 
Brooklyn's third NL pennant of the modern era in 1941. But when MacPhail 
resigned in October 1942 to rejoin the armed forces and was succeeded by 
Branch Rickey, Dressen was fired from Durocher's staff — reportedly because 
he refused to eschew betting on horses. He was on the sidelines for the 
first three months of the 1943 season before being rehired by the Dodgers 
that July. As the Second World War was ending, MacPhail returned to baseball 
as part owner, president and general manager of the New York Yankees. Following 
the 1946 campaign, he raided the Dodger coaching staff, signing Dressen 
and Red Corriden as aides under his new manager, Bucky Harris. The raids 
contributed to a public feud between MacPhail on one side and Durocher 
and Rickey on the other. Commissioner of Baseball Albert B. Chandler suspended 
Durocher for the entire 1947 season for "conduct detrimental to baseball", 
suspended Dressen for 30 days for signing a Yankee contract while still 
an employee of the Dodgers, and fined both clubs and some of their employees.[6] 
MacPhail left baseball after the Yankees' 1947 World Series victory over 
the Dodgers, and Harris was sacked after the 1948 season. Dressen was not 
retained by the new Yankee manager, Casey Stengel, but instead replaced 
Stengel as the manager of the Oakland Oaks of the Triple-A Pacific Coast 
League. He skippered the Oaks in 1949–50 and his teams finished second 
and first, winning 104 and 118 games. Simultaneously, a power struggle 
for control of the Dodgers ended in Walter O'Malley forcing Rickey out 
of the Brooklyn front office. When O'Malley fired Rickey associate Burt 
Shotton in the autumn of 1950, he gave the manager's job to Dressen. Dressen's 
Dodgers, unlike his Reds of a decade and a half before, were a perennial 
contender in the National League, with a lineup that included four future 
members of the Baseball Hall of Fame — Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, Jackie 
Robinson and Duke Snider. They had won pennants in 1947 and 1949, lost 
a playoff for the title in 1946, and come within a run of forcing another 
playoff for the 1950 National League pennant. Brooklyn charged into first 
place early in the 1951 season, while the New York Giants — led since July 
16, 1948, by Durocher himself — struggled (despite the callup of the 20-year-old 
rookie Willie Mays). When the Dodgers completed a three-game sweep of the 
Giants at Ebbets Field, August 10, the Brooklyn lead over the Giants reached 
12½ games. The following day, when Brooklyn won the first game of a doubleheader 
against the Boston Braves and the Giants fell to the Philadelphia Phillies, 
the Dodger lead stood, albeit briefly, at 13½ games. However, the Giants 
then began to win. With Sal Maglie, Larry Jansen and Jim Hearn anchoring 
their starting rotation — and (according to some accounts) with a "spy" 
stealing opponents' signs from their center-field clubhouse at their home 
field, the Polo Grounds — the Giants won sixteen in a row in August and 
37 of their last 44 games (.841) while the Dodgers went 26–22 (.542) over 
the same period. At the end of the regular season, the teams were tied, 
and had to play a best-of-three game playoff to determine who won the league 
pennant. In the ninth inning of the decisive third game at the Polo Grounds, 
Dodger starting pitcher Don Newcombe had a 4–2 lead and two men on base 
when Dressen decided to go to the bullpen, where Carl Erskine and Ralph 
Branca were warming up. "Erskine is bouncing his curve", the manager was 
told by his bullpen coach, Clyde Sukeforth. Dressen summoned Branca, whose 
second pitch to Bobby Thomson was hit into the lower left-field stands 
for a three-run homer, a 5–4 Giants win, and a National League pennant 
— Baseball's "Shot Heard ‘Round the World". Dressen kept his job in 1952 
(Sukeforth resigned, while denying that the Branca decision was a factor 
in his departure[7]) and for the next two seasons, the Dodgers dominated 
the National League, winning the pennant by margins of 4½ and 13 games. 
But they came up short against the Yankees in the World Series both times, 
losing in seven games in 1952 and six in 1953. Fresh from winning the 1953 
pennant with 105 regular-season victories, Dressen decided to publicly 
demand a three-year contract from O’Malley instead of the customary one-year 
deal the Dodgers then offered their managers. But O'Malley didn't yield 
and Dressen effectively resigned when his old contract expired.[8] He was 
replaced by Triple-A Montreal Royals manager Walter Alston — a veteran 
minor leaguer[9] who was then a relative unknown to Brooklyn fans and media.[10] 
Alston went on to sign 23 consecutive one-year contracts with O'Malley, 
while winning seven NL pennants, four World Series, and a berth in the 
Baseball Hall of Fame. Dressen returned to Oakland to manage the PCL Oaks 
in 1954 while he sorted out his major league future, then was hired to 
manage the Washington Senators, who had finished sixth in the eight-team 
American League in 1954. Dressen inherited a second division team with 
a poor farm system. Nevertheless, baseball observers predicted that he 
would rouse the Senators from their doldrums with his managerial acumen. 
On September 30, 1954 (Season 5 Episode 3), Dressen himself appeared on 
the Groucho Marx quiz program, You Bet Your Life, and predicted that the 
Senators would finish in the first division (fourth place or higher). His 
former boss O'Malley said, "Dressen will steal at least six games for Washington 
in 1955."[11] Dressen also told his team, "I guarantee we won't finish 
in sixth place again."[11] He was right – but the 1955 Senators finished 
eighth and last, the 1956 edition finished seventh, and the 1957 team was 
4–16 (and last again) on May 7, 1957, when Dressen was fired. His Senators 
won only 116 of 328 games — a winning percentage of .354. The team's next 
winning season was not until 1962, when the franchise had become the Minnesota 
Twins. After leaving Washington, Dressen rejoined the newly relocated Los 
Angeles Dodgers to serve as a coach under Alston in 1958 and 1959. When 
the 1959 Dodgers won the World Series, Dressen was in demand as a manager 
once again, and the Milwaukee Braves, who had lost a pennant playoff to 
Los Angeles at the end of the 1959 season, named him their field boss for 
1960.[12] Milwaukee was only three victories short (two in 1956 and one 
in 1959) of four consecutive National League pennants, and still boasted 
Hall of Famers Henry Aaron, Eddie Mathews and Warren Spahn, but the players 
around them had begun to fall off in production and the Braves' farm system 
could not keep up. Dressen was not able to reverse the Braves' slow decline 
to the middle of the NL pack. They again finished second in 1960, but a 
full seven games behind, and were 71–58 and in fourth place late in 1961, 
when Dressen was replaced on September 2 by Birdie Tebbetts. In 1962, Dressen 
managed the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Triple-A International League to 
91 victories. When the 1963 season began, Dressen was out of uniform, scouting 
for the Dodgers, when he got his final managing opportunity. After the 
Detroit Tigers won only 24 of their first 60 games under Bob Scheffing, 
Dressen was hired on June 18 to take over the team.[13] He rallied the 
Tigers to a 55–47 record for the remainder of 1963, a first division finish 
in 1964, and was mentoring the players who won the 1968 World Series for 
Detroit, including Denny McLain, Willie Horton, Mickey Lolich, Dick McAuliffe, 
Bill Freehan and others. However, by then, Dressen's health began to fail. 
In 1965, a heart attack sidelined him during spring training[14] and he 
didn't return as the Tigers' manager until May 31.[15] Then he suffered 
a second coronary early in the 1966 campaign, on May 16.[16] He was recovering 
from the heart attack when he was stricken with a kidney infection, and 
died of cardiac arrest in a Detroit hospital on August 10, 1966.[17] Because 
Dressen's year of birth was commonly listed as 1898 during his baseball 
career, his age was reported to be 67 at his death. However, recent sources 
such as Baseball Reference and Retrosheet have "backdated" his birth year 
to 1894, making him 71 years of age at his passing.[1] He is interred in 
the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Known for 
his self-confidence, Dressen often told his star-studded Dodgers, "Just 
hold them for a few innings, fellas. I'll think of something."[18] His 
career big league managerial record was 1,008–973 (.509), including a 298–166
