Joshua Evan Bell (born August 14, 1992) is an American professional baseball 
first baseman and outfielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). Drafted in the second round of the 2011 Major League Baseball 
Draft out of Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas, Bell received 
a $5 million signing bonus, a record for a player outside of the first 
round, to bypass his college baseball scholarship to the University of 
Texas at Austin. Josh Bell attended Jesuit College Preparatory School of 
Dallas in Dallas, Texas.[1] In his senior season at Jesuit, he had a .548 
batting average and 1.054 slugging percentage with 13 home runs, 54 runs 
batted in and 54 runs scored.[1] He was named to the USA Today All-USA 
high school baseball team and was also named the Gatorade/ESPN Rise Texas 
Player of the Year.[2] Bell committed to attend the University of Texas 
at Austin on a scholarship that would allow him to play college baseball 
for the Texas Longhorns baseball team in the Big 12 Conference.[2] Baseball 
America rated Bell as the nation's top corner outfielder available in the 
2011 Major League Baseball Draft. However, Bell sent a letter to the Commissioner 
of Baseball's office, indicating that teams should not select him, because 
he would follow through with his commitment to Texas, and would not sign 
a professional contract if drafted.[3] The Pirates drafted Bell in the 
second round (61st overall) of the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft. Bell 
took twelve credits at the University of Texas and worked out with the 
team's strength and conditioning coach during the summer.[3] Bell and the 
Pirates agreed to a contract with a $5 million signing bonus shortly before 
the August 2011 signing deadline. The signing bonus was a record for a 
player drafted in the second round.[2] The Pirates gave out a record $17 
million in signing bonuses to their 2011 draft class, surpassing the $11.93 
million the Washington Nationals spent on their 2010 draft class.[4][5] 
The Pirates assigned Bell to work out with the State College Spikes, but 
as the season was ending, he did not appear in a game with the Spikes in 
2011.[2] Bell participated in the Pirates' fall instructional league.[6] 
Bell was ranked the 69th best prospect in baseball by MLB.com before the 
2012 season.[6][7] He began the 2012 season with the West Virginia Power 
of the Class-A South Atlantic League.[6] However, on April 24, 2012, Bell 
hit what would have been a double, but pulled up limping rounding first 
base, and was tagged out standing between first and second with an injury. 
Bell ended up having a partial tear of his meniscus, on the lateral part 
of the meniscus in his knee. Bell missed almost all of the 2012 minor league 
season, and was out longer than expected due to swelling in the injured 
knee.[8] Bell played for the West Virginia Power of the Class A South Atlantic 
League in 2013.[9] He batted .279 with 13 home runs and 37 doubles in 119 
games.[10] Bell opened the 2014 season with the Bradenton Marauders of 
the Class A-Advanced Florida State League (FSL), and appeared in the 2014 
All-Star Futures Game.[11] After hitting .335 with nine home runs and 35 
RBIs for Bradenton, the Pirates promoted Bell to the Altoona Curve of the 
Class AA Eastern League on July 17. After the season, he was named the 
FSL Player of the Year. The Pirates assigned Bell to the Arizona Fall League 
after the 2014 season, where he played exclusively as a first baseman, 
due to the Pirates carrying Andrew McCutchen, Starling Marte, and Gregory 
Polanco in their major league outfield.[12][13][14] The Pirates assigned 
Bell to Altoona to start the 2015 season. He was chosen to represent the 
Pirates at the 2015 All-Star Futures Game.[15] At the end of July, the 
Pirates promoted Bell to the Indianapolis Indians of the Class AAA International 
League.[16][17] He batted .347 with a .441 on-base percentage in 145 plate 
appearances with Indianapolis, and the Pirates added Bell to their 40-man 
roster after the season.[18] Bell began the 2016 season with Indianapolis. 
After batting .324 with a .407 on-base percentage in 83 games for the Indians, 
the Pirates promoted Bell to the major leagues on July 8.[19] He made his 
MLB debut that night as a pinch hitter, and hit a grand slam in his second
