Dennis Lee Eckersley (born October 3, 1954), nicknamed "Eck", is an American 
former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher. Between 1975 and 1998, he pitched 
for the Cleveland Indians, Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, Oakland Athletics 
and St. Louis Cardinals. Eckersley had success as a starter, but gained 
his greatest fame as a closer, becoming the first of two pitchers in MLB 
history to have both a 20-win season and a 50-save season in a career. 
He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2004, his first year of 
eligibility. He is also noted as the pitcher who gave up a dramatic walk-off 
home run (a phrase Eckersley coined) to the injured Kirk Gibson in Game 
1 of the 1988 World Series. He works as a studio analyst for Red Sox games 
on the NESN network. Eckersley grew up in the San Francisco Bay area, rooting 
for both the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics. Two of his 
boyhood heroes were the Giants' Willie Mays and Juan Marichal, and he would 
go on to adopt Marichal's high leg kick pitching delivery.[1] He was a 
quarterback at Washington High School in Fremont until his senior year, 
when he gave up football to protect his throwing arm from injury.[2] He 
won 29 games as a pitcher at Washington, throwing a 90 mph fastball and 
a screwball.[3] Eckersley was drafted out of high school by the Cleveland 
Indians in the third round of the 1972 amateur draft and was disappointed 
that he was not drafted by the Giants. He made his MLB debut on April 12, 
1975. He was the American League Rookie Pitcher of the Year in 1975, compiling 
a 13–7 record and 2.60 ERA. His unstyled, long hair, moustache, and live 
fastball made him an instant and identifiable fan favorite. Eckersley pitched 
reliably over three seasons with the Indians. He threw a no-hitter on May 
30, 1977 against the California Angels. Two batters reached base in the 
game, one on a walk in the first inning and the other on a third strike 
that was a wild pitch.[4] He earned his first All-Star Game selection that 
year and finished the season with a 14-13 win-loss record.[5] Eckersley 
was traded with Fred Kendall on March 30, 1978 to the Boston Red Sox for 
Rick Wise, Mike Paxton, Bo Díaz, and Ted Cox. Over the next two seasons, 
Eckersley won a career-high 20 games in 1978 and 17 games in 1979, with 
a 2.99 ERA in each year.[5] However, during the remainder of his tenure 
with Boston, from 1980 to 1984, Eckersley pitched poorly. His fastball 
had lost some steam, as demonstrated by his 43–48 record with Boston. He 
later developed a great slider. Eckersley was traded on May 25, 1984 with 
Mike Brumley to the Chicago Cubs for Bill Buckner, one of several mid-season 
deals that helped the Cubs to their first postseason appearance since 1945. 
Eckersley performed poorly in his sole start for the Cubs in their NL Championship 
Series with the San Diego Padres. Eckersley remained with the Cubs in 1985, 
when he posted an 11–7 record with two shutouts (the last two of his career). 
Eckersley's performance deteriorated in 1986, when he posted a 6–11 record 
with a 4.57 ERA. After the season, he checked himself into a rehabilitation 
clinic to treat alcoholism.[6] Eckersley noted in Pluto's book that he 
realized the problem he had after family members videotaped him while drunk 
and played the tape back for him the next day. During his Hall of Fame 
speech he recalled that time in his life, saying "I was spiraling out of 
control personally. I knew I had come to a crossroads in my life. With 
the grace of God, I got sober and I saved my life."[7] Eckersley was traded 
again on April 3, 1987 to the Oakland Athletics, where manager Tony La 
Russa intended to use him as a set-up pitcher or long reliever. Indeed, 
Eckersley started two games with the A's before an injury to then-closer 
Jay Howell opened the door for Eckersley to move into the closer's role. 
He saved 16 games in 1987 and then established himself as a dominant closer 
in 1988 by recording a league-leading 45 saves. He recorded saves in all 
four games as the A's swept the Red Sox in the 1988 ALCS (which was matched 
by Greg Holland in the 2014 ALCS), but he found himself on the wrong end 
of Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run (Eckersley himself first coined 
the phrase "walk-off home run" to describe that moment) as the A's lost 
to the Dodgers in 5 games. In the 1989 World Series he secured the victory 
in Game Two, and then earned the save in the final game of the Series, 
as the A's swept the San Francisco Giants in four games. Eckersley was 
the most dominant closer in the game from 1988 to 1992, finishing first 
in the A.L. in saves twice, second two other times, and third once. He 
saved 220 games during the five years and never posted an ERA higher than 
2.96. He gave up five earned runs in the entire 1990 season, resulting 
in a microscopic 0.61 ERA. Eckersley's control, which had always been above 
average even when he was not otherwise pitching well, became his trademark; 
he walked only three batters in 57.2 innings in 1989, four batters in 73.1 
innings in 1990, and nine batters in 76 innings in 1991. In his 1990 season, 
Eckersley became the first relief pitcher in baseball history to have more 
saves than baserunners allowed (48 SV, 41 H, 4 BB, 0 HBP). In a statistical 
anomaly, he had exactly the same WHIP and ERA: both were 0.613636364. He 
was the American League's Cy Young Award winner and the American League's 
Most Valuable Player in 1992, a season in which he posted 51 saves. Only 
two relievers had previously accomplished the double feat: Rollie Fingers 
in 1981 and Willie Hernández in 1984. Since Eckersley, one other reliever, 
Éric Gagné, has won Cy Young honors (Gagné won the National League award 
in 2003 with the Los Angeles Dodgers). In the 1992 American League Championship 
Series against the Toronto Blue Jays, during Game 4 in what some considered 
the turning point in the series that the Jays won, Eckersley gave up a 
game-tying 2-run home run from Roberto Alomar and his team eventually lost 
7-6 in 11 innings. Eckersley's numbers slipped noticeably following 1992: 
although he still was among the league leaders in saves, his ERA climbed 
sharply, and his number of saves never climbed above 36. After the 1994 
season, the Athletics elected not to exercise a $4,000,000 option on Eckersley, 
making him a free agent. The team indicated that it would be interested 
in signing him at a lower salary.[8] Oakland signed him to a one-year contract 
in early April 1995. His contract was the first MLB deal after a three-month 
signing ban resulting from a labor dispute between owners and the players 
union.[9] When Tony La Russa left the A's after the 1995 season, he became 
the St. Louis Cardinals' new manager and arranged to bring Eckersley along 
with him. Eckersley continued in his role as closer and remained one of 
the league's best, but following the 1997 season, he signed on with the 
Red Sox for one final season. Eckersley announced his retirement in December 
1998. He commented on his career, saying, "I had a good run. I had some 
magic that was with me for a long time, so I know that I was real lucky 
to not have my arm fall off for one thing, and to make it this long physically 
is tough enough. But to me it's like you're being rescued too when your 
career's over. It's like, 'Whew, the pressure's off."[10] He retired with 
a career 197-171 win-loss record, a 3.50 ERA and 390 saves. Eckersley's 
career saves total ranks sixth on the all-time list as of early 2014.[5] 
Eckersley had appeared in more games (1,071) than any pitcher in MLB history, 
though he ranks fifth all-time as of early 2014.[5][11] Eckersley's unusual 
delivery utilized a high leg kick along with a long, pronounced sidearm 
throwing motion. He had pinpoint accuracy, and fellow Hall of Famer Goose 
Gossage said of him, "He could hit a gnat in the butt with a pitch if he 
wanted to."[12] He was aggressive and animated on the mound, and he was 
known for his intimidating stare and pumping his fist after a strikeout. 
As a starter he was able to throw four pitches for strikes, but as a reliever 
he narrowed his repertory to two pitches; a sinker and a backdoor slider.[13] 
In 1999, he ranked Number 98 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest 
Baseball Players.[14] He was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century 
Team.[15] On January 6, 2004, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame 
in his first year of eligibility, with 83.2% of the votes.[16] On August 
13, 2005, Eckersley's uniform number (43) was officially retired by the 
Oakland Athletics.[17] The baseball field at his alma mater, Washington 
High School, has been named in his honor.[18] Eckersley works as a studio 
analyst for the Boston Red Sox on NESN, where he primarily provides post-game 
coverage, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the team's play. He 
also has a multi-year deal with TBS to serve as an analyst for their post-season 
coverage.[19] In the spring of 2009, regular NESN commentator Jerry Remy 
took time off for health reasons. Eckersley filled in for Remy, providing 
color commentary alongside Don Orsillo.[20] Since then, Eckersley has been 
the primary substitute for Remy when he is unavailable, most recently filling 
in for the remainder of the 2013 season when in early August, Remy's son, 
Jared, was indicted on murder charges, after which Remy took the rest of 
the year off. Eckersley was married to his first wife Denise until she 
left him for Rick Manning, his then-Cleveland Indians teammate, in 1978; 
the affair precipitated Eckersley's trade to the Red Sox that year.[21] 
Two years later, Eckersley married model Nancy O'Neil.[6] They divorced 
shortly after his retirement from baseball.[22] His third wife, Jennifer, 
is a former lobbyist and manages Eckersley's business and charitable affairs.[23] 
In 1989, Eckersley's brother, Wally "Glenn" Eckersley, was convicted of 
attempted murder and kidnapping, and sentenced to 40 years in prison. Eckersley 
testified at his brother's trial that alcoholism ran in their family.[22]
