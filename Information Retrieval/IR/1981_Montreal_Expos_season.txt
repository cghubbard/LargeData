The 1981 Montreal Expos made it to the postseason for the first time in 
franchise history (the only time while the franchise was in Montreal, and 
the only time in franchise history until the Washington Nationals made 
the playoffs in 2012). The season was separated into two halves due to 
the 1981 Major League Baseball strike. The Montreal Expos held spring training 
at Municipal Stadium in West Palm Beach, Florida. Infielders Coaches Note:
