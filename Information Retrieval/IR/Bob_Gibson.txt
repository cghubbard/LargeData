Robert "Bob" Gibson (born November 9, 1935) is a retired American baseball 
pitcher who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. 
Louis Cardinals (1959–75). Nicknamed "Gibby" and "Hoot", Gibson tallied 
251 wins, 3,117 strikeouts, and a 2.91 earned run average (ERA) during 
his career. A nine-time All-Star and two-time World Series champion, he 
won two Cy Young Awards and the 1968 National League (NL) Most Valuable 
Player (MVP) Award. In 1981, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame 
in his first year of eligibility. The Cardinals retired his uniform number 
45 in September 1975 and inducted him into the team Hall of Fame in 2014. 
Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Gibson overcame childhood illness to excel in 
youth sports, particularly basketball and baseball. After briefly playing 
under contract to both the basketball Harlem Globetrotters team and the 
St. Louis Cardinals organization, Gibson decided to continue playing only 
baseball professionally. Once becoming a full-time starting pitcher in 
July 1961, Gibson began experiencing an increasing level of success, earning 
his first All-Star appearance in 1962. Gibson won two of three games he 
pitched in the 1964 World Series, then won 20 games in a season for the 
first time in 1965. Gibson also pitched three complete game victories in 
the 1967 World Series. The pinnacle of Gibson's career was 1968, when he 
posted a 1.12 ERA for the season and then followed that by recording 17 
strikeouts during Game 1 of the 1968 World Series. Over the course of his 
career, Gibson became known for his fierce competitive nature and the intimidation 
factor he used against opposing batters. Gibson threw a no-hitter during 
the 1971 season, but began experiencing swelling in his knee in subsequent 
seasons. After retiring as a player in 1975, Gibson later served as pitching 
coach for his former teammate Joe Torre. At one time a special instructor 
coach for the St. Louis Cardinals, Gibson was later selected for the Major 
League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. Gibson is the author of the memoir 
Pitch by Pitch, with Lonnie Wheeler (Flatiron Books, 2015). Gibson was 
born in Omaha, Nebraska, the last of Pack and Victoria Gibson's seven children 
(five boys and two girls).[1][2] Gibson's father died of tuberculosis three 
months prior to Gibson's birth, and Gibson himself was named Pack Robert 
Gibson in his father's honor.[2][3] While he revered his father's legacy, 
Gibson disliked the name Pack, and later changed his first name to Robert.[3][4] 
Despite a childhood that included health problems like rickets, and a serious 
case of either asthma or pneumonia when he was three, Gibson was active 
in sports in both informal and organized settings, particularly baseball 
and basketball.[5] Gibson's brother Josh (no relation to the Negro Leagues 
star player), who was 15 years his senior, had a profound impact on his 
early life, serving as a mentor to him.[6] Gibson played on a number of 
youth basketball and baseball teams his brother coached, many of which 
were organized through the local YMCA.[7] Gibson attended Omaha Technical 
High School, where during his tenure he participated on the track, basketball, 
and baseball teams.[8] Health issues resurfaced for Gibson, though, and 
he needed a doctor's permission to compete in high school sports because 
of a heart murmur that occurred in tandem with a rapid growth spurt.[9] 
Gibson was named to the All-State basketball team during his senior year 
of high school by a newspaper in Lincoln, Nebraska, and soon after won 
a full athletic scholarship for basketball to Creighton University.[10] 
While at Creighton, Gibson majored in sociology, and continued to experience 
success playing basketball. At the end of Gibson's junior basketball season 
he averaged 22 points per game, and made third team Jesuit All-American.[11] 
As his graduation from Creighton approached, the spring of 1957 proved 
to be a busy time for Gibson. Aside from getting married, Gibson had garnered 
the interest of Harlem Globetrotters basketball team and the St. Louis 
Cardinals baseball team.[12] In 1957, Gibson received a $3,000 bonus to 
sign with the Cardinals.[4] He delayed his start with the organization 
for a year, playing basketball with the Harlem Globetrotters,[13] earning 
the nickname "Bullet" and becoming famous for backhanded dunks. Gibson 
was assigned to the Cardinals' big league roster for the start of the 1959 
season, recording his Major League debut on April 15 as a relief pitcher.[4] 
Reassigned to the Cardinals minor league affiliate in Omaha soon after, 
Gibson returned to the Major Leagues on July 30 as a starting pitcher, 
earning his first Major League win that day.[14] Gibson's experience in 
1960 was similar, pitching nine innings for the Cardinals before shuffling 
between the Cardinals and their Rochester affiliate until mid-June.[15] 
After posting a 3–6 record with a 5.61 ERA, Gibson traveled to Venezuela 
to participate in winter baseball at the conclusion of the 1960 season.[16] 
Cardinals manager Solly Hemus shuffled Gibson between the bullpen and the 
starting pitching rotation for the first half of the 1961 season.[17] In 
a 2011 documentary, Gibson indicated that Hemus's racial prejudice played 
a major role in his misuse of Gibson, as well as of teammate Curt Flood, 
both of whom were told by Hemus that they wouldn't make it as major leaguers, 
and should try something else.[18] Hemus was replaced as Cardinals manager 
in July 1961 by Johnny Keane, who had been Gibson's manager on the Omaha 
minor league affiliate several years prior.[19] Keane and Gibson shared 
a positive professional relationship, and Keane immediately moved Gibson 
into the starting pitching rotation full-time. Gibson proceeded to compile 
an 11–6 record the remainder of the year, and posted a 3.24 ERA for the 
full season.[4][20] "Between games, Mays came over to me and said, 'Now, 
in the second game, you're going up against Bob Gibson.' I only half-listened 
to what he was saying, figuring it didn't make much difference. So I walked 
up to the plate the first time and started digging a little hole with my 
back foot...No sooner did I start digging that hole than I hear Willie 
screaming from the dugout: 'Noooooo!' Well, the first pitch came inside. 
No harm done, though. So I dug in again. The next thing I knew, there was 
a loud crack and my left shoulder was broken. I should have listened to 
Willie." In late May of the 1962 season Gibson pitched 22 2⁄3 consecutive 
scoreless innings on his way to being named to his first National League 
All-Star team.[22] Because of an additional All-Star Game played each season 
from 1959 to 1962, Gibson was named to the second 1962 N.L. All-Star game 
as well, where he pitched two innings.[23] After suffering a fractured 
ankle late in the season, Gibson, sometimes referred to by the nickname 
"Hoot" (a reference to western film star Hoot Gibson), still finished 1962 
with his first 200 plus strikeout season.[4][19][23] The rehabilitation 
of Gibson's ankle was a slow process, and by May 19 of the 1963 season 
he had recorded only one win.[24] Gibson then turned to rely on his slider 
and two different fastball pitches to reel off six straight wins prior 
to late July.[25] Gibson and all other National League pitchers benefited 
from a rule change that expanded the strike zone above the belt buckle.[26] 
Adding to his pitching performances was Gibson's offensive production, 
with his 20 RBIs outmatching the combined RBI output of entire pitching 
staffs on other National League teams.[27] Even with Gibson's 18 wins and 
the extra motivation of teammate Stan Musial's impending retirement, the 
Cardinals finished six games out of first place.[28] Building off their 
late season pennant run in 1963, the 1964 Cardinals developed a strong 
camaraderie that was noted for being free of the racial tension that predominated 
in the United States at that time.[29][30] Part of this atmosphere stemmed 
from the integration of the team's spring training hotel in 1960, and Gibson 
and teammate Bill White worked to confront and stop use of racial slurs 
within the team.[31] On August 23, the Cardinals were 11 games behind the 
Philadelphia Phillies, and remained six and half games behind on September 
21.[32] The combination of a nine-game Cardinals winning streak and a ten-game 
Phillies losing streak then brought the season down to the final game. 
The Cardinals faced the New York Mets, and Gibson entered the game as a 
relief pitcher in the fifth inning.[32] Aware that the Phillies were ahead 
of the Cincinnati Reds 4–0 at the time he entered the game, Gibson proceeded 
to pitch four innings of two-hit relief, while his teammates scored 11 
runs of support to earn the victory.[32] The Cardinals' win and the Phillies' 
defeat of the Reds made the Cardinals the National League champions, and 
Gibson was rewarded for his fine performance down the stretch with his 
first of four NL Player of the Month awards (7-2 in nine games, 1.95 ERA, 
65 SO). They next faced the New York Yankees in the 1964 World Series. 
Gibson was matched against Yankees starting pitcher Mel Stottlemyre for 
three of the Series' seven games, with Gibson losing Game 2, then winning 
Game 5.[33] In Game 7 Gibson pitched into the ninth inning, where he allowed 
home runs to Phil Linz and Clete Boyer, making the score 7–5 Cardinals.[34] 
With Ray Sadecki warming up in the Cardinal bullpen, Gibson retired Bobby 
Richardson for the final out, giving the Cardinals their first World Championship 
since 1946.[34] Along with his two victories, Gibson set a new World Series 
record by striking out 31 batters.[35] Gibson made the All-Star team again 
in 1965 season, and when the Cardinals were well out of the pennant race 
by August, attention turned on Gibson to see if he could win 20 games for 
the first time.[36] Gibson was still looking for win number 20 on the last 
day of the season, a game where new Cardinals manager Red Schoendienst 
rested many of the regular players.[37] Gibson still prevailed against 
the Houston Astros by a score of 5–2.[37] The 1966 season marked the opening 
of Busch Memorial Stadium for the Cardinals, and Gibson was selected to 
play in the All-Star Game in front of the hometown crowd that year as well.[38] 
The Cardinals built a three and half game lead prior to the 1967 season 
All-Star break, and Gibson pitched the seventh and eighth innings of the 
1967 All-Star game. Gibson then faced the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 15, 
when Roberto Clemente hit a line drive off Gibson's right leg.[39] Unaware 
his leg had been fractured, Gibson faced three more batters before his 
right fibula bone snapped above the ankle.[40] After Gibson returned on 
September 7, the Cardinals secured the National League pennant on September 
18, 10½ games ahead of the San Francisco Giants.[41][42][43] In the 1967 
World Series against the Boston Red Sox, Gibson allowed only three earned 
runs and 14 hits over three complete game victories (Games 1, 4, and 7), 
the latter two marks tying Christy Mathewson's 1905 World Series record. 
Just as he had in 1964, Gibson pitched a complete game victory in Game 
7, and contributed offensively by hitting a home run that made the game 
3–0.[44][45] Gibson became the only pitcher to be on the mound for the 
final out of Game 7 of a World Series multiple times.[46] The 1968 season 
became known as "The Year of the Pitcher", and Gibson was at the forefront 
of pitching dominance. His earned run average was 1.12, a live-ball era 
record, as well as the major league record in 300 or more innings pitched. 
It was the lowest major league ERA since Dutch Leonard's 0.96 mark, 54 
years earlier.[47] Gibson threw 13 shutouts, three fewer than fellow Nebraskan 
Grover Alexander's 1916 major league record of 16.[48] He won all twelve 
starts in June and July, pitching a complete game every time, (eight of 
which were shutouts), and allowed only six earned runs in 108 innings pitched 
(a 0.50 ERA). Gibson pitched 47 consecutive scoreless innings during this 
stretch, at the time the third-longest scoreless streak in major league 
history. He also struck out 91 batters, and he won two-consecutive NL Player 
of the Month awards.[49] Gibson finished the season with 28 complete games 
out of 34 games started. Of the games he didn't complete, he was pinch-hit 
for, meaning Gibson was not removed from the mound for another pitcher 
for the entire season.[50] Gibson won the National League MVP Award; not 
until Clayton Kershaw in 2014 would another National League pitcher do 
so.[51] With Denny McLain winning the American League's Most Valuable Player 
award, 1968 remains, to date, the only year both MVP Awards went to pitchers. 
For the 1968 season, opposing batters only had a batting average of .184, 
an on-base percentage of .233, and a slugging percentage of .236. Gibson 
lost nine games against 22 wins, despite his record-setting low 1.12 ERA; 
the anemic batting throughout baseball included his own Cardinal team. 
The 1968 Cardinals had one .300 hitter, while the team-leading home run 
and RBI totals were just 16 and 79, respectively. Gibson lost five 1–0 
games, one of which was to San Francisco Giants pitcher Gaylord Perry's 
no-hitter on September 17. The Giants' run in that game came on a first-inning 
home run by light-hitting Ron Hunt—the second of two he would hit the entire 
season, and one of only 11 that Gibson allowed in 304 2⁄3 innings.[52] 
In Game 1 of the 1968 World Series, Gibson struck out 17 Detroit Tigers 
to set a World Series record for strikeouts in one game, which still stands 
today (breaking Sandy Koufax's record of 15 in Game 1 of the 1963 World 
Series).[47][53][54] He also joined Ed Walsh as the only pitchers to strike 
out at least one batter in each inning of a World Series game, Walsh having 
done so in Game Three of the 1906 World Series. After allowing a leadoff 
single to Mickey Stanley in the ninth inning, Gibson finished the game 
by striking out Tiger sluggers Al Kaline, Norm Cash and Willie Horton in 
succession. Recalling the performance, Tigers outfielder Jim Northrup remarked: 
"We were fastball hitters, but he blew the ball right by us. And he had 
a nasty slider that was jumping all over the place."[55] Gibson next pitched 
in Game 4 of the 1968 World Series, defeating the Tigers' ace pitcher Denny 
McLain by a 10–1 score.[56] The teams continued to battle each other, setting 
the stage for another winner-take-all Game 7 in St. Louis on October 10, 
1968.[57] In this game Gibson was matched against Tigers pitcher Mickey 
Lolich, and the two proceeded to hold their opponents scoreless for the 
first six innings.[58] In the top of the seventh, Gibson retired the first 
two batters before allowing two consecutive singles.[58] Detroit batter 
Jim Northrup then hit a two-run triple over the head of center fielder 
Curt Flood, leading to Detroit's Series win.[59] The overall pitching statistics 
in MLB's 1968 season, led by Gibson's individual record setting performance, 
are often cited as one of the reasons for Major League Baseball's decision 
to alter pitching related rules.[60] Sometimes known as the "Gibson rules", 
MLB lowered the pitcher's mound by five inches in 1969 from 15 inches to 
10 inches, and reduced the height of the strike zone from the batter's 
armpits to the jersey letters.[56] Aside from the rule changes set to take 
effect in 1969, cultural and monetary influences increasingly began impacting 
baseball, as evidenced by nine players from the Cardinals 1968 roster who 
hadn't reported by the first week of spring training due to the status 
of their contracts.[61] On February 4, 1969, Gibson appeared on The Tonight 
Show Starring Johnny Carson, and said the Major League Baseball Players 
Association (MLBPA) had suggested players consider striking before the 
upcoming season began.[62] However, Gibson himself had no immediate contract 
worries, as the $125,000 salary Gibson requested for 1969 was agreed to 
by team owner Gussie Busch and the Cardinals, setting a new franchise record 
for the highest single-season salary.[63] Despite the significant rule 
changes, Gibson's status as one of the league's best pitchers was not immediately 
affected. In 1969, he went 20–13 with a 2.18 ERA, 4 shutouts and 28 complete 
games.[64] On May 12, 1969, Gibson struck out three batters on nine pitches 
in the seventh inning of a 6–2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers.[65] Gibson 
became the ninth National League pitcher and the 15th pitcher in Major 
League history to throw an "immaculate inning". After pitching into the 
tenth inning of the July 4 game against the Cubs, Gibson was removed from 
a game without finishing an inning for the first time in more than 60 consecutive 
starts, a streak spanning two years.[66] After participating in the 1969 
All-Star Game (his seventh selection), Gibson set another mark on August 
16 when he became the third pitcher in Major League history to reach the 
200-strikeout plateau in seven different seasons.[66][67] Gibson experienced 
an up-and-down 1970 season, marked at the low point by a July slump where 
he resorted to experimenting with a knuckleball for the first time in his 
career.[68] Just as quickly, Gibson returned to form, starting a streak 
of seven wins on July 28, and pitching all 14 innings of a 5–4 win against 
the San Diego Padres on August 12. He would go on to win his fourth and 
final NL Player of the Month award for August (6-0, 2.31 ERA, 55 SO).[69] 
Gibson won 23 games in 1970, and was once again named the NL Cy Young Award 
winner.[70] Gibson was sometimes used by the Cardinals as a pinch-hitter, 
and in 1970 he hit .303 for the season in 109 at-bats, which was over 100 
points higher than teammate Dal Maxvill.[70] For his career, he batted 
.206 (274-for-1,328) with 44 doubles, 5 triples, 24 home runs (plus two 
more in the World Series) and 144 RBIs, plus stealing 13 bases and walking 
63 times.[64] He is one of only two pitchers since World War II with a 
career batting average of .200 or higher and at least 20 home runs and 
100 RBIs (Bob Lemon, who had broken into the majors as a third baseman, 
is the other at .232). Gibson was above average as a baserunner and thus 
was occasionally used as a pinch runner, despite managers' general reluctance 
to risk injury to pitchers in this way. Gibson achieved two highlights 
in August 1971. On the 4th of the month, he defeated the Giants 7–2 at 
Busch Memorial Stadium for his 200th career victory.[13] Ten days later, 
he no-hit the eventual World Champion Pittsburgh Pirates 11–0 at Three 
Rivers Stadium.[71][72] Three of his 10 strikeouts in the game were to 
Willie Stargell, including the game's final out. The no-hitter was the 
first in Pittsburgh since Nick Maddox at Exposition Park in 1907; none 
had been pitched in the 62-year (mid-1909 to mid-1970) history of Three 
Rivers Stadium's predecessor, Forbes Field. He was the second pitcher in 
Major League Baseball history, after Walter Johnson, to strike out over 
3,000 batters, and the first to do so in the National League.[13] He accomplished 
this at home, at Busch Stadium on July 17, 1974; the victim was César Gerónimo 
of the Cincinnati Reds.[73] Gibson began the 1972 season by going 0–5, 
but broke Jesse Haines's club record for victories on June 21, and finished 
the year with 19 wins.[74] During the summer of 1974, Gibson felt hopeful 
he could to put together a winning streak, but he continually encountered 
swelling in his knee.[75] In January 1975, Gibson announced he would retire 
at the end of the 1975 season, admittedly using baseball to help cope with 
his recent divorce from his former wife Charlene.[76] During the 1975 season, 
he went 3–10 with a 5.04 ERA.[64] In his final appearance, Gibson was summoned 
as a reliever in a 6–6 game against the Cubs and gave up the game-winner 
to an unheralded player, best known for his odd name and being the son 
of TV personality Peter Marshall. "When I gave up a grand slam to Pete 
LaCock", Bob Gibson said later, "I knew it was time to quit." The Cardinals 
honored him with "Bob Gibson Day" in September 1975. In the eight seasons 
from 1963 to 1970, Gibson won 156 games and lost 81, for a .658 winning 
percentage.[64][77] He won nine Gold Glove Awards, was awarded the World 
Series MVP Award in 1964 and 1967, and won Cy Young Awards in 1968 and 
1970.[78][79][80] "(Hank Aaron told me) 'Don't dig in against Bob Gibson, 
he'll knock you down. He'd knock down his own grandmother if she dared 
to challenge him. Don't stare at him, don't smile at him, don't talk to 
him. He doesn't like it. If you happen to hit a home run, don't run too 
slow, don't run too fast. If you happen to want to celebrate, get in the 
tunnel first. And if he hits you, don't charge the mound, because he's 
a Gold Glove boxer.' I'm like, 'Damn, what about my 17-game hitting streak?' 
That was the night it ended." Gibson was a fierce competitor who rarely 
smiled and was known to throw brushback pitches to establish dominance 
over the strike-zone and intimidate the batter, similar to his contemporary 
and fellow Hall of Famer Don Drysdale.[82] Even so, Gibson had good control 
and hit only 102 batters in his career (fewer than Drysdale's 154).[64] 
Gibson was surly and brusque even with his teammates. When his catcher 
Tim McCarver went to the mound for a conference, Gibson brushed him off, 
saying "The only thing you know about pitching is that it's hard to hit."[83] 
Gibson casually disregards his reputation for intimidation, though, saying 
that he made no concerted effort to seem intimidating. He joked in an interview 
with a St. Louis public radio station that the only reason he made faces 
while pitching was because he needed glasses and could not see the catcher's 
signals.[84] Before Gibson returned to his home in Omaha at the end of 
the 1975 season, Cardinals general manager Bing Devine offered him an undefined 
job that was contingent on approval from higher-ranking club officials.[85] 
Unsure of his future career path, Gibson declined, and used the motor home 
the Cardinals had given him as a retirement gift to travel across the western 
United States during the 1975 offseason. Returning to Omaha, Gibson continued 
to serve on the board of a local bank, was at one point the principal investor 
in radio station KOWH, and started "Gibson's Spirits and Sustenance" restaurant, 
sometimes working twelve-hour days as owner/operator.[86] He also worked 
as a backup color analyst for ABC's Monday Night Baseball telecasts in 
1976. Gibson had a brief stint as a color commentator for the N.Y Nets 
of the American Basketball Association. Gibson returned to baseball in 
1981 after accepting a coaching job with Joe Torre, who was then manager 
of the New York Mets.[87] Torre termed Gibson's position "attitude coach", 
the first such title in Major League history.[88] After Torre and his coaching 
staff were let go at the end of the 1981 season, Torre moved on to manage 
the Atlanta Braves in 1982, where he hired Gibson as a pitching coach.[89] 
The Braves proceeded to challenge for the National League pennant for the 
first time since 1969, ultimately losing to the Cardinals in the 1982 National 
League Championship Series.[90] Gibson remained with Torre on the Braves' 
coaching staff until the end of the 1984 season.[91] Gibson then took to 
hosting a pre- and post-game show for Cardinals baseball games on radio 
station KMOX from 1985 until 1989.[92] Gibson also served as color commentator 
for baseball games on ESPN in 1990, but declined an option to continue 
the position over concerns he would have to spend too much time away from 
his family.[93] In 1995, Gibson again served as pitching coach on a Torre-led 
staff, this time returning to the Cardinals.[70] Gibson is father to three 
children; daughters Annette and Renee with his first wife Charline, and 
son Chris with his second wife Wendy.[94] Gibson's jersey number 45 was 
retired by the St. Louis Cardinals on September 1, 1975. In 1981, he was 
inducted into the Baseball Hall Of Fame.[95] In 1999, he ranked Number 
31 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and 
was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[96][97] He has 
a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.[98] A bronze statue of Gibson by 
Harry Weber is located in front of Busch Stadium, commemorating Gibson 
along with other St. Louis Cardinals greats. Another statue of Gibson was 
unveiled outside of Werner Park in Gibson's home city, Omaha, Nebraska, 
in 2013.[99][100] In 2004, he was named as the most intimidating pitcher 
of all time from the Fox Sports Net series The Sports List.[citation needed] 
The street on the north side of Rosenblatt Stadium, former home of the 
College World Series in his hometown of Omaha, is named Bob Gibson Boulevard. 
In January, 2014, the Cardinals announced Gibson among 22 former players 
and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame
