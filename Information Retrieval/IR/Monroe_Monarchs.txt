The Monroe Monarchs were a professional baseball team based in Monroe, 
Louisiana, which played in the Negro leagues from the late 1920s to about 
1935, mostly as a minor league team loosely associated with the Kansas 
City Monarchs.[1] The team was created by Fred Stovall, a Texan oil drilling 
millionaire, who later financed the Negro Southern League. In the 1930s, 
a time of acute segregation in most of the U.S., the team's games were 
watched by crowds of black and white people alike. The most famous player 
with the team was Hall of Famer Hilton Smith. When the team first formed 
it played in the semi-pro Dixie League until Stovall formed the Negro Southern 
League, with four other teams in 1932. The NSL is considered a de facto 
major league that year, since it was the only organized league to complete 
the 1932 season. The Monarchs finished with a 26-22 record in their only 
season they were considered a major league team, and did not qualify for 
any post-season play-off.[2] The team played in Casino Park in Monroe, 
at what became 29th and Hope. It was 360 feet (110 metres) in left, 450 
feet (138 metres) in center and 330 feet (102 metres) in right.[3] Built 
on Stovall's plantation, the park and its associated recreational facilities 
(including a swimming pool and a dance pavilion[4]) were considered some 
of the finest in the league.[5] Stovall accommodated the players in houses 
on his plantation, provided a cook to prepare their meals, and bought three 
brand-new Ford cars in 1932 for the team's travel.[6] The team disbanded 
soon after 1935[7] and in 1937 Casino Park was leased to a local white 
team—the Monroe Twins who became the Monroe White Sox in 1938—who played 
in the Cotton States League.[8] In the summer of 2010, the Monroe Monarchs 
Field was opened to the public in Monroe, Louisiana. At the opening, the 
Monroe Monarchs Historical Foundation, founded in 2006 by native Monroyans 
Scott Greer and Jeffrey Newman, unveiled a historical marker dedicated
