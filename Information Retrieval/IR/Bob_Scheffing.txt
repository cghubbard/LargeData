As player As manager Robert Boden Scheffing (August 11, 1913 – October 
26, 1985) was an American professional baseball player, coach, manager 
and front-office executive. Nicknamed "Grumpy", the native of Overland, 
Missouri, is most often identified with the Chicago Cubs, for whom he played 
as a catcher (1941–42, 1946–50), coached (1954–55), and managed (1957–59). 
As a Major Leaguer, Scheffing batted .263 with 357 hits in 517 games with 
the Cubs, Cincinnati Reds (1950–51) and St. Louis Cardinals (1951). His 
career began in 1935 in the Cardinals' farm system, but he was unable to 
crack the Major Leagues until he was selected by the Cubs in the 1940 Rule 
5 draft. En route to the Majors, he spent the 1939 season as the 25-year-old 
playing manager of the Washington Red Birds of the Class D Pennsylvania 
State Association. As a full-time manager, Scheffing led the Los Angeles 
Angels of the Pacific Coast League to the 1956 PCL championship, and was 
promoted to skipper of the parent Cubs the following season. In three full 
years at the Cubs' helm, Scheffing compiled a 208–254 (.450) record. His 
1957 team finished 62–92 and tied for seventh place in the eight-team National 
League, but his 1958 and 1959 clubs won 72 and 74 games respectively and 
finished tied for fifth place each season. Scheffing also spent 2½ years 
(1961 through June 16, 1963) as manager of the Detroit Tigers. Taking over 
a sixth-place team, he led the 1961 Tigers to 101 victories and second 
place in the American League. Although the Tigers eventually finished eight 
games out of first place, they led the league until July 25 and battled 
the world champion New York Yankees for the pennant until a devastating 
three-game sweep at Yankee Stadium in early September. The 1962 Tigers 
won 16 fewer games than 1961's team, and finished fourth. Then the 1963 
club got off to a poor start (24–36) and was in ninth place in the ten-team 
league when Scheffing was replaced on June 19 by Chuck Dressen.[1] Although 
Scheffing's mark with the Tigers was 210–173 (.548), his career managerial 
record fell nine games short of .500, at 418–427 (.495). As a coach, Scheffing 
also served with the St. Louis Browns (1952–53) and Milwaukee Braves (1960, 
under Dressen), in addition to his tenure with the Cubs. After working 
as a Detroit scout and radio broadcaster, Scheffing joined the front office 
of the New York Mets and became general manager early in 1970 following 
the sudden death of Johnny Murphy.[2] The Mets won the 1973 National League 
pennant during his tenure, then fell in a seven-game World Series to the 
Oakland Athletics. But Scheffing is most remembered by many Met fans for 
his trade of young pitcher Nolan Ryan to the California Angels following 
the 1971 season. Ryan went on to set the all-time career strikeout record 
and earn a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame, while third baseman Jim 
Fregosi, the Angels' star whom the Mets received in the deal, struggled 
in New York. Scheffing was replaced by Joe McDonald as Mets' GM in 1975, 
although he continued in the organization as a scout. He died in Phoenix,
