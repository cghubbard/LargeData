The 1946 New York Yankees season was the team's 44th season in New York, 
and its 46th overall. The team finished with a record of 87â€“67, finishing 
17 games behind of the Boston Red Sox. New York was managed by Joe McCarthy, 
Bill Dickey, and Johnny Neun. The Yankees played at Yankee Stadium. On 
May 24, Joe McCarthy, who had managed the team since 1931 and led them 
to seven World Championships, resigned.[2] Although he had been in ill 
health, there were also underlying issues with team executive Larry MacPhail[3] 
and frustrations with the team's performance, especially that of pitcher 
Joe Page,[4] with whom he had an argument the previous day on the team 
plane.[5] Long-time Yankee catcher Bill Dickey took over the team. Dickey 
himself resigned on September 12,[6] and coach Johnny Neun finished out 
the year at the helm. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other
