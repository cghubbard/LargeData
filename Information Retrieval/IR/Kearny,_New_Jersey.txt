Kearny (/ˈkɑːrni/ KAR-nee[1][22]) is a town in Hudson County, New Jersey, 
United States and a suburb of Newark. As of the 2010 United States Census, 
the town's population was 40,684,[11][12][13] reflecting an increase of 
171 (+0.4%) from the 40,513 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn 
increased by 5,639 (+16.2%) from the 34,874 counted in the 1990 Census.[23] 
Kearny is named after Civil War general Philip Kearny.[24][25] It began 
as a township formed by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 8, 
1867, from portions of Harrison Township. Portions of the township were 
taken on July 3, 1895, to form East Newark. Kearny was incorporated as 
a town on January 19, 1899, based on the results of a referendum held two 
days earlier.[26] The Arlington section of town was named for Arlington 
Station on the Erie Railroad at the Arlington Mill plant, owned by Arlington 
Mills of Lawrence, Massachusetts. The area of Kearny Township, created 
in 1867, had been part of the original Crown Grant of 30,000 acres (120 km2) 
obtained by Major William Sandford of Barbados on July 4, 1668. Major Sandford 
named it New Barbadoes Neck after his old home.[27] As was the custom of 
the time, the Major paid 20 pounds sterling to Chief Tantaqua of the Hackensack 
tribe for all their reserve rights and titles. Sanford's friend Major Nathaniel 
Kingsland acquired the property in 1708 and sold the upper western tract 
of the Grant for 300 pounds sterling to Captain Arent Schuyler two years 
later. The new purchase included present-day Kearny, North Arlington, Lyndhurst 
and Kingsland.[28] Shortly after Schuyler's purchase of his new homestead, 
a peculiar green stone was uncovered. It was sent to England for analysis 
and he learned that it contained 80% copper. His opening of a copper mine 
brought the first steam engine to America from England; it was used to 
pump out the deep mine shaft. The engine was secretly delivered by its 
engineer, Josiah Hornblower. The engine and mines were destroyed by fire 
in 1772 and remained idle for some years.[29][30] Schuyler Mansion played 
a role during the American Revolutionary War Era. When Lord Howe of England 
took possession of New York Harbor, the proximity of Schuyler Mansion drew 
many of his officers. They generally traveled over a road that today is 
referred to as the Belleville Turnpike, which was originally constructed 
in 1759 using cedar logs from the nearby swamps.[28] During September 1777, 
General Henry Clinton, head of the British Expeditionary Forces in America, 
selected Schuyler Mansion for his headquarters during one of his more important 
raiding operations which included the famed Battle of Second River. The 
Mansion stood until 1924, a period of 214 years, when it was torn down 
by a land development company, despite the company's offers to transfer 
the land an organization that would be able to pay to maintain the property.[31] 
In the middle 19th century, Kearny was the upper, or northern, section 
of the Township of Harrison. A prominent citizen and resident of the upper 
section, General N. M. Halsted, felt it was impossible under these political 
conditions for his section to obtain proper recognition. He engaged an 
energetic campaign for an independent township. He succeeded when the NJ 
Legislature of 1867 on March 14, adopted "an act creating the Township 
of Kearny". The town was named to honor Major General Phil Kearny, Commander 
of the New Jersey Forces in the Civil War and the owner of the mansion 
known as Belle Grove (or Belgrove), locally called "Kearny Castle".[32] 
On April 8, 1867, the first election of town officers was held. General 
N. M. Halsted was elected Chairman. The first official seat of Government 
was three rooms in the old Lodi Hotel, on the northeast corner of Schuyler 
and Harrison Avenues.[33] In the early 1870s, Kearny erected its first 
Town Hall, on the corner of Kearny and Woodland Avenues, the present site 
of the Knox Presbyterian Church Parish Hall. This served as a Town Hall, 
Court House, and Schoolhouse. The Minute Book of the Township states on 
August 16, 1870, the first step toward establishing Kearny's present public 
school system was taken. The first schoolhouse was housed in the Town Hall 
built at Kearny and Woodland Avenues in 1873.[33] The Highland Hose No. 
4 firehouse which is now on the National Register of Historic Places list 
was built in 1895. The town's nickname, "Soccer Town, U.S.A." is derived 
from a soccer tradition that originated in the mid-1870s, when thousands 
of Scottish and Irish immigrants settled in the town, after two Scottish 
companies, Clark Thread Company and Nairn Linoleum, opened two local mills 
and a factory.[1] When the town's growth demanded larger quarters, the 
present Kearny Town Hall, built of Indiana limestone, was erected in 1909.[33] 
The early influx and development of industry in Kearny dates back to 1875 
when the Clark Thread Company of Paisley in Scotland extended its activities 
to the United States by erecting two large mills in Kearny, and adding 
two others in 1890. These mills brought to Kearny thousands of Scots immigrants. 
Many of them would play on Kearny's soccer teams in National Association 
Football League. Many are buried at Arlington Memorial Park in the Kearny 
Uplands.[34] In 1876, the Mile End Thread Mills started operating, giving 
employment to several hundred operators. In 1883, the Marshall Flax Spinning 
Company of England erected a large plant in Kearny, known as the Linen 
Thread Company. Their need for experienced flax spinners brought an influx 
of workers from other sections of the British Isles. Families of those 
early textile workers were the nucleus of Kearny's present population. 
The Puraline Manufacturing Company, later called the Arlington Company, 
which became a subsidiary of E. I. DuPont de Nemours Company, had purchased 
a large tract of land east of the Arlington Station on the Erie Railroad 
extending well out, north of the railroad embankment, into the meadowland. 
In 1887, Sir Michael Nairn established the Nairn Linoleum Company of Kirkcaldy 
in Scotland, now the Congoleum Nairn Company of Kearny, giving further 
impetus to local industrial growth. This also lead to the growth in the 
Scottish American population which In the 1960s was about 21,000.[35] In 
1902, the Lovell–Dressel Company, manufacturers of marine and railway lamps 
and fixtures, located in Kearny adjacent to the Erie Railroad. Other industries 
which located in Kearny include: Swift & Company, Koppers Company, Theobald 
Industries, Standard Tool & Manufacturing, Wilkata Box Company, Harris 
Steel Company and L & R Manufacturing. Between 1926 and 1986, the Kearny 
Works of Western Electric employed as many as 24,000 in producing a variety 
of hardware and supplies for the Bell System and was the home of the "Kearny 
Standard" for tools and equipment, and was sold by AT&T in 1984 by which 
time the plant had 4,000 employees who earned a total of $128 million a 
year, making it one of the county's largest employers.[36][37] Cargo ships 
were built at Kearny Yards during World War I, and warships during World 
War II.[38] The HBO drama series The Sopranos was filmed partially in Kearny. 
One of its buildings, used for Satriale's Pork Store, was later razed to 
prepare for a condominium development.[39] According to the United States 
Census Bureau, the town had a total area of 10.193 square miles (26.399 km2), 
including 8.775 square miles (22.726 km2) of land and 1.418 square miles 
(3.673 km2) of water (13.91%).[2][3] Unincorporated communities, localities 
and place names located partially or completely within the town include 
Arlington, Schuylers Corner and West Arlington.[40] The town is bordered 
by East Newark, Harrison and North Arlington (which is located in Bergen 
County). The Passaic River separates the town from Newark and Belleville, 
both located in Essex County. The Hackensack River separates it from Jersey 
City.[41][42] The town is varied in topography and roughly divided into 
three parts: the Kearny Uplands, the Kearny Meadows and Kearny Point.[43] 
Main thoroughfares include the eponymous Kearny Avenue (the local segment 
of Ridge Road / Frank E. Rodgers Boulevard), Bergen Avenue, Midland Avenue, 
Schuyler Avenue and Passaic Avenue. The unincorporated community of Arlington 
is located within the town. A number of small parks running along Passaic 
River are collectively called Riverbank Park. The largest, located on the 
colloquial "Bunnyland Hill", is a gift from Kearny's veterans. It is named 
after a small zoo named Bunnyland, which was maintained by the local Kiwanis 
Club, that occupied part of the present Bunnyland Hill in the 20th century. 
During Kearny's Fourth of July celebrations (which include a fireworks 
display), Bunnyland Hill is the primary gathering spot for celebrants and 
observers. The largest park is West Hudson Park, shared with Harrison, 
which contains a variety of sports fields, recreational areas, and an artificial 
pond.[44] The second largest recreational zone is the Kearny Playground 
at Gunnel Oval. At the 2010 United States Census, there were 40,684 people,

at eligible merchants.[55] Kearny is governed under the Town form of New 
Jersey municipal government. The government consists of a Mayor and Town 
Council comprising eight council members. A Mayor is elected directly by 
the voters at-large to a four-year term of office. The Town Council is 
elected by the voters to four-year terms of office in partisan elections, 
on a staggered basis, with one of the two seats from each ward coming up 
for election in two consecutive years followed by two years with no elections.[8] 
The Mayor and Council operate on a legislative basis, with the Mayor having 
veto power. The day-to-day operations are the responsibility of the Town 
Administrator whose duties are specified by local ordinance, and who generally 
carries out the policies adopted by the Mayor and Council.[56] As of 2016[update], 
the Mayor of Kearny is Al Santos, who has been Mayor of Kearny since January 
1, 2000, and whose current term of office ends December 31, 2017. Before 
his election as mayor, Santos served as councilman of Kearny's Second Ward 
for one year.[4] Members of the Town Council are:[57][58][59][60][61] In 
February 2015, the Town Council selected Marytrine De Castro, as chosen 
by the Democratic municipal committee, to fill the vacant First Ward seat 
expiring in December 2017 that had been held by Alexa Arce until she resigned 
from office the previous month.[66] In the November general election, De 
Castro was elected to serve the balance of the term.[59] The town is protected 
by the Kearny Fire Department,[67] which operates out of four fire stations.[68] 
The current Chief of Department is Steve Dyl.[69] Below is a list of fire

Catholic Archdiocese of Newark closed Mater Dei Academy at the conclusion 
of the 2011–12 school year. Mater Dei had been opened three years earlier 
as the merger of two existing schools, St. Stephen's and Holy Cross, but 
attendance declined from 250 in its first year to 170 in its final year[117] 
The Kearny Public Library is one of New Jersey's remaining Carnegie libraries,[118] 
and houses a museum on its third floor which mounts exhibitions related 
to the history and culture of the town and has a collection of artifacts 
related to the town's namesake.[119][120] As of May 2010[update], the town 
had a total of 70.89 miles (114.09 km) of roadways, of which 50.75 miles 
(81.67 km) were maintained by the municipality, 7.30 miles (11.75 km) by 
Hudson Countyand 7.73 miles (12.44 km) by the New Jersey Department of 
Transportation and 5.11 miles (8.22 km) by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.[121] 
The Belleville Turnpike (Route 7) forms the northern border of the town 
with North Arlington and crosses the Rutgers Street Bridge over the Passaic 
River into Belleville. Kearny Avenue passes through the town and continues 
north as Ridge Road, the beginning of NJ 17. US 1/9 (Pulaski Skyway) and 
US 1/9 Truck pass through. The Essex Freeway (Interstate 280) passes through 
the town and ends at Interstate 95(W) (the New Jersey Turnpike eastern 
and western spurs) at the tollgate for Exit 15W. New Jersey Transit offers 
bus service to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan and 
to other New Jersey communities. Bus service to Newark is available on 
the 1, 30, 40, 43, 76 and 80 routes.[122] Kearny was formerly served by 
trains of both the Erie Railroad's Newark Branch (later Erie-Lackawanna 
Newark Branch) and its Greenwood Lake Division (later the Erie-Lackawanna's 
Greenwood Lake-Boonton Line; and Conrail and New Jersey Transit's Boonton 
Line) which stopped at the now abandoned Arlington Station. Newark Branch 
service was terminated in October, 1966. New Jersey Transit discontinued 
Boonton Line service in 2002 when the Montclair Connection was opened.[123][124] 
Through the early 1970s trains also stopped at a second station along this 
route known as West Arlington. This station was just to the east of the 
now abandoned WR Draw movable bridge. Prior to April 30, 1967, a station 
in South Kearny, was served by the Central Railroad of New Jersey's Newark 
and New York Railroad via the PD Draw over the Passaic River. This station 
was popular with employees of the giant Western Electric plant, and other 
industries in the area. In the final years of this service a pair of rush 
hour trains ran in each direction between South Kearny, and the CNJ's Broad 
Street Station in downtown Newark, as well as a single rush hour round 
trip between South Kearny, and Plainfield. This train operated via Elizabethport, 
and the CNJ main line. The closest airport with scheduled passenger service 
is Newark Liberty International Airport, located 6.5 miles (10.5 km) away 
in Newark and Elizabeth. People who were born in, residents of, or otherwise
