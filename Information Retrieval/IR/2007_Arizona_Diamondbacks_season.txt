The Arizona Diamondbacks' 2007 season started with the Diamondbacks attempting 
to win the NL West Division. The Arizona Diamondbacks' biggest move in 
the offseason was when, on January 9, 2007, they got their 2001 World Series 
co-MVP back, pitcher Randy Johnson after making a blockbuster deal with 
the New York Yankees, sending to New York relief pitcher Luis Vizca√≠no 
and three other prospects.[1] However, Johnson suffered from injuries and 
underwent season-ending surgery in early August. Despite Johnson's absence 
and the fact they had fewer runs scored (712) to runs allowed (732), the 
Diamondbacks won their first National League West title since 2002 and 
finished with their first winning record since 2003, and also had the best 
record in the national league (90-72). Diamondbacks rookie Chris Young 
became the first rookie in the history of Major League Baseball to have 
had 30 home runs and 25 stolen bases in one season.[2] Infielders Coaches
