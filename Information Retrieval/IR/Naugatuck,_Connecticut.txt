Naugatuck is a consolidated borough and town in New Haven County, Connecticut, 
United States. The town spans both sides of the Naugatuck River just south 
of Waterbury, and includes the communities of Union City on the east side 
of the river, which has its own post office, Straitsville on the southeast 
(along Route 63), and Millville on the west (along Rubber Avenue). As of 
the 2010 census, Naugatuck had a population of 31,862.[1] Naugatuck was 
settled in 1701 as a farming community in rural western Connecticut. As 
the Industrial Revolution commenced, Naugatuck was transformed into a hardscrabble 
mill town like its neighbors in the Naugatuck Valley. Rubber was the chief 
manufactured product. Charles Goodyear worked at his brother's rubber company, 
the Goodyear Metallic Rubber Shoe Company & Downtown Naugatuck, until the 
company was consolidated into the United States Rubber Company. The United 
States Rubber Company (renamed Uniroyal Inc. in 1961) was founded in Naugatuck 
in 1892 as a consolidation of nine rubber companies, and maintained their 
corporate headquarters there until the 1980s. Their Footwear Division manufactured 
Keds sneakers in Naugatuck from 1917 until the 1980s. U.S. Rubber also 
produced Naugahyde in a Naugatuck factory, but it is no longer produced 
there. Due to an increase in the price of sulfuric acid, which was needed 
for the process then used for reclaiming old rubber, the United States 
Rubber Co. formed the Naugatuck Chemical Company on June 1, 1904, and the 
company soon was in the forefront of the chemical industry in the United 
States. Naugatuck Chemical remained a subsidiary of the U.S. Rubber Co. 
until, under Uniroyal, it gained independence as Uniroyal Chemical Co. 
They moved their operations to Middlebury, Connecticut, in the 1970s. The 
Risdon Manufacturing Company, established in Naugatuck around 1910, began 
by producing safety pins. Local housewives and children were often hired 
to attach the pins to cardboard for easy sale. Risdon became the manufacturer 
of total packaging for cosmetics, personal, household and other consumer 
products and home sewing notions such as common pins, needles, snaps and 
other accessories. It is now the Crown Risdon Co., headquartered in Watertown, 
Connecticut. In the 1960 Harold Barber founded H. Barber and Sons in the 
community. The company builds beach rakes for picking up debris and grooming 
beaches and claims to be the largest such business in the world.[2] Naugatuck 
was the home to Peter Paul, the Hershey Foods division that produces Almond 
Joy and Mounds candy bars, until the Hershey Co. closed the Peter Paul 
factory in November 2007. The normally peaceful Naugatuck River that flows 
through Naugatuck overflowed its banks on August 19, 1955.[3] Fed by over 
10 inches (250 mm) of rain from Hurricane Diane, the river cut a path of 
destruction that forever changed the face of Naugatuck. As American manufacturing 
declined in the late 20th century, the mills closed and the town fell on 
largely hard times. With the expansion of suburbs, especially in New Haven 
and Fairfield County, the town is now largely a bedroom community for the 
middle class. With this, many of Naugatuck's neighbors are fairly wealthy. 
Middlebury and Oxford are affluent towns that have higher performing school 
districts, but the price to live in these suburbs is high. Currently, many 
new more expensive homes are being built as people from Fairfield County 
and other areas are looking for more affordable housing and convenient 
access to major highways. The local high school, Naugatuck High School, 
has a storied football rivalry with the high school in Ansonia that is 
one of the longest in America. Like the other rival high schools in the 
Naugatuck Valley, the two teams meet the morning of Thanksgiving Day. The 
first meeting was in 1900. Ansonia is the long-term winner in the series. 
Naugatuck High School's mascot is the greyhound, and its colors are garnet 
and grey. The town of Naugatuck is affectionately referred to as "Naugy" 
by its residents. The town common features 11 commissions by the renowned 
New York architecture firm of McKim, Mead & White. Naugatuck is also no 
stranger when it comes to being in popular media. In 2008, an episode of 
Food Paradise (Sandwich Paradise) on the Travel Channel highlighted the 
Nardelli's Grinder Shoppe, its specialty(s) Italian grinder sandwiches 
("Meat Combo"). The town has also been used as a filming location for works 
such as Engine Trouble, released in 2002, and War of the Worlds, filmed 
at the former Uniroyal plant and released in 2005. (The plant was demolished 
on February 28, 2008.) Naugatuck has experienced significant economic and 
budgetary problems since 2009 resulting from the 2008 a recession and poor 
budgeting since then. Even though the credit ratings has remained stable, 
reliance on one time revenues to pay for budget increases and increasing 
costs in the public employee union contracts has resulted in Naugatuck 
having one of the highest mill rates in the state. Critics point out issues 
with public employee pensions negotiated by former Mayor Robert Mezzo which 
resulted in many employees retiring with pensions equaling 120% and greater 
of their yearly salaries. These employees, retiring in their 50's, are 
expected to be receiving the pensions for the next 20–40 years. Currently 
Naugatuck's mill rate is 45.57. Naugatuck has a total of 5 public elementary 
schools (which include grades K-4), 2 public intermediate schools (grades 
5-6), 1 public middle school (grades 7-8), and 1 public high school (grades 
9-12). The high school has an overall enrollment of 1,267 students and 
a graduation rate of 82%.[4] In 2013, an $81 million renovation for the 
high school took place and was completed by the fall of 2015 that brought 
the school up to date and back to mint condition.[5] Naugatuck High School 
was ranked 149th best in Connecticut.[6] According to the United States 
Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 16.5 square miles (42.6 km²), 
of which 16.4 square miles (42.4 km²) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.2 km²), 
or 0.36%, is water. Naugatuck is unique in Connecticut government for being 
the only consolidated town and borough. Every other borough in Connecticut 
is a special services district located within another town, the unit of 
Connecticut local government. Naugatuck has both a town clerk and a borough 
clerk managing official records, the same as Connecticut cities having 
two clerks: a town clerk and a city clerk. As with most other Connecticut 
towns and cities, Naugatuck elect their officials in November of odd-numbered 
years. Naugatuck is served by buses of the Waterbury Division of Connecticut 
Transit. Route N1 connects the borough center to the Millville section 
of town, and Route N2 connects the borough center to the Straitsville section 
of town. The town also has a Metro-North Railroad station (Naugatuck) along 
the Waterbury Branch of the New Haven Line. The principal highways through 
the town are Connecticut Route 63 (connecting to New Haven), Route 68 (leading 
to Durham), and the Route 8 expressway (for Waterbury, Derby, Torrington, 
and Bridgeport). As of the census[9] of 2000, there were 30,989 people,
