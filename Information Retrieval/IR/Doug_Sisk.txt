Douglas Randall Sisk (born September 26, 1957 in Renton, Washington), is 
a former professional baseball player who pitched in the Major Leagues 
as a relief pitcher from 1982–1988 and 1990-1991. His primary pitch was 
a sinker that was difficult for batters to drive in the air. During his 
nine-year major-league career, Sisk allowed only 15 home runs in over 500 
innings. Sisk attended Washington State University, where he played college 
baseball for the Cougars in 1980.[1] Sisk made his Major League debut with 
the New York Mets on September 6, 1982. Although he started out well for 
the Mets, he often frustrated fans and managers with his tendency to walk 
opposing hitters—Sisk walked 4.6 batters per nine innings over the course 
of his career, earning from fans the derisive nickname of "Doug Risk".[2] 
He became the target of boos from the fans at Shea Stadium when his performance 
began to decline late in his Met tenure. He was also part of the notorious 
"Scum Bunch" as a Met, along with fellow pitcher Jesse Orosco and left 
fielder Danny Heep. After baseball, Sisk became the athletic director of 
the Lakewood, WA Boys and Girls Club in 2003, a position which he no longer 
holds. He currently works as a sales representative for a Colombia Distributors, 
a large wine and beer distributor based out of Sisk's home town of Renton,
