Jesse Louis Jackson, Sr. (born Jesse Louis Burns; October 8, 1941) is an 
American civil rights activist, Baptist minister, and politician. He was 
a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988 
and served as a shadow U.S. Senator for the District of Columbia from 1991 
to 1997. He is the founder of the organizations that merged to form Rainbow/PUSH. 
Former U.S. Representative Jesse Jackson, Jr. is his eldest son. Jackson 
was also the host of Both Sides with Jesse Jackson on CNN from 1992 to 
2000. Jackson was born in Greenville, South Carolina, to Helen Burns (1924-2015), 
a 16-year-old high school student, and her 33-year-old married neighbor, 
Noah Louis Robinson. Robinson was a former professional boxer who was an 
employee of a textile brokerage and a well-known figure in the black community.[1][2][3] 
One year after Jesse's birth, his mother married Charles Henry Jackson, 
a post office maintenance worker who later adopted the boy.[1][2] Jesse 
was given his stepfather's name in the adoption, but as he grew up, he 
also maintained a close relationship with Robinson. He considered both 
men to be his father.[1][2] As a young child, Jackson was taunted by the 
other children regarding his out-of-wedlock birth, and has said these experiences 
helped motivate him to succeed.[1][2] Living under Jim Crow segregation 
laws, Jackson was taught to go to the back of the bus and use separate 
water fountains – practices he accepted until the Montgomery Bus Boycott 
of 1955.[2] He attended the racially segregated Sterling High School in 
Greenville, where he was elected student class president, finished tenth 
in his class, and earned letters in baseball, football and basketball.[4] 
Upon graduating from high school in 1959, he rejected a contract from a 
minor league professional baseball team so that he could attend the University 
of Illinois on a football scholarship.[3][5] Following his second semester 
at the predominantly white University of Illinois, Jackson transferred 
to the North Carolina A&T, an historically black university located in 
Greensboro, North Carolina. There are differing accounts of the reasons 
behind this transfer. Jackson has claimed that he changed schools because 
racial prejudice prevented him from playing quarterback and limited his 
participation on a competitive public-speaking team.[5][6] Writing on ESPN.com 
in 2002, sociologist Harry Edwards noted that the University of Illinois 
had previously had a black quarterback, but also noted that black athletes 
attending traditionally white colleges during the 1950s and 1960s encountered 
a "combination of culture shock and discrimination".[6] Edwards also suggested 
that Jackson had left the University of Illinois in 1960 because he had 
been placed on academic probation.[6] However, the president of the University 
of Illinois reported in 1987 that Jackson's 1960 freshman year transcript 
was clean, and said he would have been eligible to re-enroll at any time.[7] 
While attending A&T, Jackson played quarterback and was elected student 
body president.[3] He became active in local civil rights protests against 
segregated libraries, theaters and restaurants.[8] He graduated with a 
B.S. in sociology in 1964, then attended the Chicago Theological Seminary 
on a scholarship.[2] He dropped out in 1966, three classes short of earning 
his master's degree, to focus full-time on the Civil Rights Movement.[4][9] 
He was ordained a minister in 1968, and in 2000, was awarded his Master 
of Divinity Degree based on his previous credits earned, plus his life 
experience and subsequent work.[9][10] Jackson has been known for commanding 
public attention since he first started working for Martin Luther King 
Jr.[11] In 1965, Jackson participated in the Selma to Montgomery marches 
organized by James Bevel, King and other civil rights leaders in Alabama.[2] 
Impressed by Jackson's drive and organizational abilities, King soon began 
giving Jackson a role in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), 
though he was concerned about Jackson's apparent ambition and attention-seeking.[2][12] 
When Jackson returned from Selma, he was charged with establishing a frontline 
office for the SCLC in Chicago.[12] In 1966, King and Bevel selected Jackson 
to head the Chicago branch of the SCLC's economic arm, Operation Breadbasket[12][13] 
and he was promoted to national director in 1967.[5] Operation Breadbasket 
had been started by the Atlanta leadership of the SCLC as a job placement 
agency for blacks.[14] Under Jackson's leadership, a key goal was to encourage 
massive boycotts by black consumers as a means to pressure white-owned 
businesses to hire blacks and to purchase goods and services from black-owned 
firms.[12][14] T. R. M. Howard, a 1950s proponent of the consumer boycott 
tactic, soon became a major supporter of Jackson's efforts – donating and 
raising funds, and introducing Jackson to prominent members of the black 
business community in Chicago.[12] Under Jackson's direction, Operation 
Breadbasket held popular weekly workshops on Chicago's south side featuring 
white and black political and economic leaders,[13] and religious services 
complete with a jazz band and choir.[14] Jackson became involved in SCLC 
leadership disputes following the assassination of King on April 4, 1968. 
When King was shot, Jackson was in the parking lot one floor below.[2] 
Jackson told reporters he was the last person to speak to King, and that 
King died in his arms – an account that several King aides disputed.[2] 
In the wake of King's death, Jackson worked on SCLC's Poor People's Crusade 
in Washington, D.C., and was credited with managing its 15-acre tent city 
– but he began to increasingly clash with Ralph Abernathy, King's successor 
as chairman of the SCLC.[15][16] In 1969, The New York Times reported that 
Jackson was being viewed as King's successor by several black leaders and 
that Jackson was one of the few black activists who was preaching racial 
reconciliation. Jackson was also reportedly seeking coalition with whites 
in order to approach what were considered racial problems as economic and 
class problems, "When we change the race problem into a class fight between 
the haves and the have-nots, then we are going to have a new ball game", 
he said.[14] In the 21st century, some public school systems are working 
on an approach for affirmative action that deals with family income rather 
than race, recognizing that some minority members have been very successful. 
The Times also indicated that Jackson was being criticized as too involved 
with middle-class blacks, and for having an unattainable goal of racial 
unity.[14] In the spring of 1971, Abernathy ordered Jackson to move the 
national office of Operation Breadbasket from Chicago to Atlanta and sought 
to place another person in charge of local Chicago activities, but Jackson 
refused to move.[13] He organized the October 1971 Black Expo in Chicago, 
a trade and business fair to promote black capitalism and grass roots political 
power.[17] The five-day event was attended by black businessmen from 40 
states, as well as politicians such as Cleveland Mayor Carl Stokes, and 
Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. Daley's presence was seen as a testament 
to the growing political and economic power of blacks.[17] In December 
1971, Jackson and Abernathy had a complete falling out, with the split 
described as part of a leadership struggle between Jackson, who had a national 
profile, and Abernathy, whose prominence in the Civil Rights Movement was 
beginning to wane.[13] The break began when Abernathy questioned the handling 
of receipts from the Black Expo, and then suspended Jackson as leader of 
Operation Breadbasket for not obtaining permission to form non-profit corporations.[13] 
Al Sharpton, then youth group leader of the SCLC, left the organization 
to protest Jackson's treatment and formed the National Youth Movement.[18] 
Jackson, his entire Breadbasket staff, and 30 of the 35 board members resigned 
from the SCLC and began planning a new organization.[19][20] Time magazine 
quoted Jackson as saying at that time that the traditional civil rights 
movement had lost its "offensive thrust."[20] People United to Save Humanity 
(Operation PUSH) officially began operations on December 25, 1971;[20] 
Jackson later changed the name to People United to Serve Humanity.[21] 
T. R. M. Howard was installed as a member of the board of directors and 
chair of the finance committee.[12] At its inception, Jackson planned to 
orient Operation PUSH toward politics and to pressure politicians to work 
to improve economic opportunities for blacks and poor people of all races.[20] 
SCLC officials reportedly felt the new organization would help black businesses 
more than it would help the poor.[20] In 1978 Jackson called for a closer 
relationship between blacks and the Republican Party, telling the Party's 
National Committee that "Black people need the Republican Party to compete 
for us so we can have real alternatives ... The Republican Party needs 
black people if it is ever to compete for national office."[22] In 1984, 
Jackson organized the Rainbow Coalition and resigned his post as president 
of Operation PUSH in 1984 to run for president of the United States, though 
he remained involved as chairman of the board.[21] PUSH's activities were 
described in 1987 as conducting boycotts of business to induce them to 
provide more jobs and business to blacks and as running programs for housing, 
social services and voter registration.[21] The organization was funded 
by contributions from businesses and individuals.[21] In early 1987 the 
continued existence of Operation PUSH was imperiled by debt, a fact that 
was used by Jackson's political opponents during his race for the 1988 
Democratic Party nomination.[21] In 1996, the Operation PUSH and Rainbow 
Coalition organizations were merged. Jackson's influence extended to international 
matters in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1983, Jackson traveled to Syria to secure 
the release of a captured American pilot, Navy Lt. Robert Goodman who was 
being held by the Syrian government. Goodman had been shot down over Lebanon 
while on a mission to bomb Syrian positions in that country. After a dramatic 
personal appeal that Jackson made to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, Goodman 
was released. Initially, the Reagan administration was skeptical about 
Jackson's trip to Syria. However, after Jackson secured Goodman's release, 
United States President Ronald Reagan welcomed both Jackson and Goodman 
to the White House on January 4, 1984.[23] This helped to boost Jackson's 
popularity as an American patriot and served as a springboard for his 1984 
presidential run. In June 1984, Jackson negotiated the release of twenty-two 
Americans being held in Cuba after an invitation by Cuban president Fidel 
Castro.[24] On the eve of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Jackson made a trip 
to Iraq, to plead to Saddam Hussein for the release of foreign nationals 
held there as a "human shield", securing the release of several British 
and twenty American individuals.[25][26][27] He traveled to Kenya in 1997 
to meet with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi as United States President 
Bill Clinton's special envoy for democracy to promote free and fair elections. 
In April 1999, during the Kosovo War, Jackson traveled to Belgrade to negotiate 
the release of three U.S. POWs captured on the Macedonian border while 
patrolling with a UN peacekeeping unit. He met with the then-Yugoslav president 
Slobodan Milošević, who later agreed to release the three men.[28] His 
international efforts continued into the 2000s. On February 15, 2003, Jackson 
spoke in front of over an estimated one million people in Hyde Park, London 
at the culmination of the anti-war demonstration against the imminent invasion 
of Iraq by the U.S. and the United Kingdom. In November 2004, Jackson visited 
senior politicians and community activists in Northern Ireland in an effort 
to encourage better cross-community relations and rebuild the peace process 
and restore the governmental institutions of the Belfast Agreement. In 
August 2005, Jackson traveled to Venezuela to meet Venezuelan President 
Hugo Chávez, following controversial remarks by televangelist Pat Robertson 
in which he implied that Chávez should be assassinated. Jackson condemned 
Robertson's remarks as immoral. After meeting with Chávez and addressing 
the Venezuelan Parliament, Jackson said that there was no evidence that 
Venezuela posed a threat to the U.S. Jackson also met representatives from 
the Afro Venezuela and indigenous communities.[29] In 2005, he was enlisted 
as part of the United Kingdom's "Operation Black Vote", a campaign run 
by Simon Woolley to encourage more of Britain's ethnic minorities to vote 
in political elections ahead of the May 2005 General Election.[30] During 
the 1980s, he achieved wide fame as a politician, as well as becoming a 
well-known spokesman for civil rights issues. In 1980 for example, Jackson 
mediated in a firefighters' strike.[2] On November 3, 1983, he announced 
his campaign for President of the United States in the 1984 election,[31] 
becoming the second African American (after Shirley Chisholm) to mount 
a nationwide campaign for president. In the Democratic Party primaries, 
Jackson, who had been written off by pundits as a fringe candidate with 
little chance at winning the nomination, surprised many when he took third 
place behind Senator Gary Hart and former Vice President Walter Mondale, 
who eventually won the nomination. Jackson garnered 3,282,431 primary votes, 
or 18.2 percent of the total, in 1984,[2] and won three to five primaries 
and caucuses, including Louisiana, the District of Columbia, South Carolina, 
and one of two separate contests in Mississippi.[32] More Virginia caucus-goers 
supported Jesse Jackson than any other candidate, but Walter Mondale won 
more Virginia delegates.[33] In May 1988, Jackson complained that he had 
won 21% of the popular vote[34] but was awarded only 9% of the delegates. 
He afterwards stated that he had been handicapped by party rules. While 
Mondale (in the words of his aides) was determined to establish a precedent 
with his vice presidential candidate by picking a woman or visible minority, 
Jackson criticized the screening process as a "p.r. parade of personalities". 
He also mocked Mondale, saying that Hubert Humphrey was the "last significant 
politician out of the St. Paul–Minneapolis" area.[35] Jackson was criticized 
in the early 1980s for refusing to repudiate Louis Farrakhan, for his support 
of a Palestinian state, and for remarks made to a reporter where he referred 
to New York City as "Hymietown".[2][36] (Hymie is a pejorative term for 
Jews.) Jackson ultimately acknowledged he had used the term, and said he 
had been wrong; however, he also said that he had considered the conversation 
with the reporter to be off-the-record at the time he made the remarks.[36] 
Jackson apologized during a speech before national Jewish leaders in a 
Manchester, New Hampshire synagogue, but an enduring split between Jackson 
and many in the Jewish community continued at least through the 1990s.[36] 
Shortly after President Jimmy Carter fired U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young 
for meeting with Palestine Liberation Organization representatives, Jackson 
and other black leaders began publicly endorsing a Palestinian state, with 
Jackson calling Israel's prime minister a "terrorist", and then soliciting 
Arab-American financial support.[37] Jackson has since apologized for some 
of these remarks, but they badly damaged his presidential campaign, as 
"Jackson was seen by many conservatives in the United States as hostile 
to Israel and far too close to Arab governments."[38] According to a 1987 
New York Times article, Jackson began attempting to improve his relationship 
with the Jewish community after 1984.[2] In 2000, he was invited to speak 
in support of Jewish Senator and Vice Presidential candidate Joe Lieberman 
at the Democratic National Convention.[39] In 1988, Jackson again sought 
the Democratic Party presidential nomination. According to a November 1987 
article in The New York Times, "Most political analysts give him little 
chance of being nominated – partly because he is black, partly because 
of his unretrenched liberalism."[2] However, his successes in the past 
made him a more credible candidate, and he was both better financed and 
better organized than in 1984. Jackson once again exceeded expectations 
as he more than doubled his previous results, prompting R.W. Apple of The 
New York Times to call 1988 "the Year of Jackson".[40] In early 1988, Jackson 
organized a rally at the former American Motors assembly plant in Kenosha, 
Wisconsin, approximately two weeks after new owner Chrysler announced it 
would close the plant by the end of the year. In his speech, Jackson spoke 
out against Chrysler's decision, stating "We have to put the focus on Kenosha, 
Wisconsin, as the place, here and now, where we draw the line to end economic 
violence!" and compared the workers' fight to that of the 1965 Voting Rights 
Movement in Selma, Alabama. As a result, the UAW Local 72 union voted to 
endorse his candidacy, even against the rules of the UAW.[41] Briefly, 
after he won 55% of the vote in the Michigan Democratic caucus, he was 
considered the frontrunner for the nomination, as he surpassed all the 
other candidates in total number of pledged delegates. However, Jackson's 
campaign suffered a significant setback less than two weeks after the UAW 
endorsement when he narrowly lost the Colorado primary to Michael Dukakis, 
and was defeated handily the following day in the Wisconsin primary by 
Dukakis. Jackson's showing among white voters in Wisconsin was significantly 
higher than in his 1984 run, but was also noticeably lower than pre-primary 
polling had predicted. The back-to-back victories established Dukakis as 
the clear Democratic frontrunner, and he went on to claim the party's nomination, 
but lost the general election in November.[42] Jackson's campaign had also 
been interrupted by allegations regarding his half-brother Noah Robinson, 
Jr.'s criminal activity.[43] Jackson had to answer frequent questions about 
Noah, who was often referred to as "the Billy Carter of the Jackson campaign".[44] 
At the conclusion of the Democratic primary season, Jackson had captured 
6.9 million votes and won 11 contests; seven primaries (Alabama, the District 
of Columbia, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Puerto Rico and Virginia) 
and four caucuses (Delaware, Michigan, South Carolina and Vermont).[45] 
Jackson also scored March victories in Alaska's caucuses and Texas's local 
conventions, despite losing the Texas primary.[46][47] In both races, Jackson 
ran on what many considered to be a very liberal platform. In 1987, The 
New York Times described him as " a classic liberal in the tradition of 
the New Deal and the Great Society".[2] Declaring that he wanted to create 
a "Rainbow Coalition" of various minority groups, including African Americans, 
Hispanic Americans, Arab-Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, 
family farmers, the poor and working class, and homosexuals, as well as 
European American progressives who fit into none of those categories, Jackson 
ran on a platform that included: With the exception of a resolution to 
implement sanctions against South Africa for its apartheid policies, none 
of these positions made it into the party's platform in either 1984 or 
1988.[citation needed] Although Jackson was one of the most liberal members 
of the Democratic Party, his position on abortion was originally more in 
line with pro-life views. Within one month after the 1973 Supreme Court 
decision, Roe v. Wade, legalized abortion, Jackson began a PUSH campaign 
against the decision, calling abortion murder and declaring that Jesus 
and Moses might not have been born if abortion had been available in ancient 
times.[12] Jackson's strong rhetoric on abortion temporarily alienated 
one of his major supporters, T. R. M Howard, a black physician who made 
a living from performing abortions.[12] In 1975, Jackson endorsed a plan 
for a constitutional amendment banning abortion.[48] He also endorsed the 
Hyde Amendment, which bars the funding of abortions through the federal 
Medicaid program. Writing in a 1977 National Right to Life Committee News 
report, Jackson argued that the basis for Roe v. Wade – the right to privacy 
– was also a premise that had been used to justify slavery and the treatment 
of slaves on the plantations. Jackson decried what he believed was the 
casual taking of life, and the decline in society's value system. However, 
Jackson later adopted a pro-choice view that abortion is a right and that 
the government should not prevent a woman from having an abortion.[49] 
He ran for office as "shadow senator" for the District of Columbia when 
the position was created in 1991,[50] and served as such through 1997, 
when he did not run for re-election. This unpaid position was primarily 
a post to lobby for statehood for the District of Columbia.[51] In the 
mid-1990s, he was approached about being the United States Ambassador to 
South Africa but declined the opportunity in favor of helping his son, 
Jesse Jackson, Jr., run for the United States House of Representatives.[52] 
Jackson was initially critical of the "Third Way" or more moderate policies 
of Bill Clinton, so much so that, according to journalist Peter Beinart, 
Clinton was "petrified about a primary challenge from" Jackson in the 1996 
election.[53] However, he became a key ally in gaining African American 
support for Clinton and eventually became a close adviser and friend of 
the Clinton family.[52] His son, Jesse Jackson, Jr., also emerged as a 
political figure, becoming a member of the United States House of Representatives 
from Illinois. On May 2, 1999, during the Kosovo war, three US soldiers, 
who had been held captive were released as a result of talks with Jackson.[54] 
Jackson's negotiation was not sanctioned by the Clinton Administration.[54] 
On November 18, 1999, seven Decatur students were expelled for two years 
after participating in a brawl at a high school football game. The incident 
was caught on home video and became a national media event when CNN ran 
pictures of the fight. After the students were expelled, Jackson spoke 
out arguing that the expulsions were unfair and racially biased. He called 
on the school board to reverse their decision.[55] On January 20, 2001, 
Bill Clinton's final day in office, Jackson had petitioned Clinton for 
the pardons of Congressman Mel Reynolds, John Bustamante, and Dorothy Rivers, 
all of which were approved. Jesse requested a fourth pardon, for his half-brother 
Noah Robinson, who had been convicted of murdering Leroy Barber and sentenced 
to life imprisonment. This was the only pardon Clinton disapproved as Robinson 
had submitted three pardon appeals prior, all of which were denied by the 
Justice Department. [56] Jackson was a target of the 2002 white supremacist 
terror plot.[57] In early 2005, Jackson visited the parents in the Terri 
Schiavo case; he supported their unsuccessful bid to keep her alive.[58] 
In March 2006, an African-American woman accused three white members of 
the Duke University men's lacrosse team of raping her. During the ensuing 
controversy, Jackson stated that his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition would pay for 
the rest of her college tuition regardless of the outcome of the case. 
The case against the three men was later thrown out and the players were 
declared innocent by the North Carolina Attorney General.[59] Jackson took 
a key role in the scandal caused by comedic actor Michael Richards' racially 
charged comments in November 2006. Richards called Jackson a few days after 
the incident to apologize; Jackson accepted Richards' apology[60] and met 
with him publicly as a means of resolving the situation. Jackson also joined 
black leaders in a call for the elimination of the "N-word" throughout 
the entertainment industry.[61] On June 23, 2007, Jackson was arrested 
in connection with a protest at a gun store in Riverdale, a poor suburb 
of Chicago, Illinois. Jackson and others were protesting due to allegations 
that the gun store had been selling firearms to local gang members and 
was contributing to the decay of the community. According to police reports, 
Jackson refused to stop blocking the front entrance of the store and let 
customers pass. He was charged with one count of criminal trespass to property.[62] 
In March 2007, Jackson declared his support for then-Senator Barack Obama 
in the 2008 democratic primaries.[63] Jackson later criticized Obama in 
2007 for "acting like he's white," in response to the Jena 6 beating case.[64] 
On July 6, 2008, during an interview with Fox News, a microphone picked 
up Jackson whispering to fellow guest Reed Tuckson:[65] "See, Barack's 
been, ahh, talking down to black people on this faith-based... I want to 
cut his nuts off."[66] Jackson was expressing his disappointment in Obama's 
Father's Day speech chastisement of black fathers.[67] Subsequent to his 
Fox News interview, Jackson apologized and reiterated his support for Obama.[66] 
On November 4, 2008, Jackson attended the Obama victory rally in Chicago's 
Grant Park. In the several moments before Obama spoke, Jackson was seen 
in tears.[68] Jackson has commended Obama's 2012 decision to support gay 
marriage and has compared the fight for same-sex marriage to fight against 
slavery and the anti-miscegenation laws that once prevented interracial 
marriage.[69] He would be in favor of federal legislation extending marriage 
rights to gays, because he feels that if this issue is left up to the states, 
some states will continue to deny gays equal protection and equal rights.[69] 
Ebony Magazine named Jackson to its "100 most influential black Americans" 
list in 1971.[15] In 1979, Jackson received the Jefferson Award for Greatest 
Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged.[71] In 1989, he was awarded 
the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP.[72] In 1991, Jackson received the American 
Whig-Cliosophic Society's James Madison Award for Distinguished Public 
Service.[73] Clinton awarded Jackson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, 
the nation's highest honor bestowed on civilians in August 2000.[74] In 
2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante included Jackson on his list of 100 Greatest 
African Americans.[8] In 2008, Jackson was presented with an Honorary Fellowship 
from Edge Hill University. In an AP-AOL "Black Voices" poll in February 
2006, Jackson was voted "the most important black leader".[75] Jackson 
inherited the title of the High Prince of the Agni people of Côte d'Ivoire 
from Michael Jackson. In August 2009, he was crowned Prince Côte Nana by 
Amon N'Douffou V, King of Krindjabo, who rules more than a million Agni 
tribespeople.[76] Jackson married Jacqueline Lavinia Brown (born 1944) 
on December 31, 1962,[77] and together they have five children: Santita 
(1963), Jesse, Jr. (1965), Jonathan Luther (1966), Yusef DuBois (1970), 
and Jacqueline Lavinia (1975).[78] Jackson's younger brother, Charles "Chuck" 
Jackson, was a singer with the vocal group The Independents and as a solo 
artist who issued two albums in the late 70s. Along with his songwriting 
partner and fellow producer, Marvin Yancy, he was largely responsible for 
launching the career of Natalie Cole.[79] On Memorial Day, May 25, 1987, 
Jesse was made a Master Mason on Sight by Grand Master Senter of the Most 
Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Illinois; thereby making him a Prince 
Hall Freemason.[80] In 2001, it was revealed Jackson had had an affair 
with a staffer, Karin Stanford, that resulted in the birth of a daughter 
Ashley in May 1999. According to CNN, in August 1999, the Rainbow Push 
Coalition had paid Stanford $15,000 in moving expenses and $21,000 in payment 
for contracting work. A promised advance of an additional $40,000 against 
future contracting work was rescinded once the affair became public.[81] 
This incident prompted Jackson to withdraw from activism for a short time.[82] 
Jackson was paying $4,000 a month in child support as of 2001.[83] Convention
