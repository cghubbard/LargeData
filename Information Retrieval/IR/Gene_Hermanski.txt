Eugene Victor Hermanski (May 11, 1920 â€“ August 9, 2010[1]) was a Major 
League Baseball outfielder. A native of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, he attended 
Seton Hall University. Signed by the Philadelphia Athletics as an amateur 
free agent in 1939, Hermanski made his Major League Baseball debut with 
the Brooklyn Dodgers on August 15, 1943, and appeared in his final game 
on September 22, 1953. The Salem (Massachusetts) Evening News, reported 
on August 8, 1943, that the then-22-year-old outfielder, recently released 
from the USCG Salem Air Station in order to enlist in the USN's V-5 Aviation 
Training Program, was expected to use a month-long break to play for the 
Brooklyn Dodgers. "Hermanski hit a homer and two triples in an exhibition 
game with the Red Sox and poled out a homer and a double in a contest with 
the Braves." When Hermanski played for the Brooklyn Dodgers along with 
Jackie Robinson, he demonstrated he was a great teammate by suggesting 
that all of the players stand in solidarity by wearing No. 42 to confuse 
potential snipers who were said to be out to kill Robinson because he had 
broken the color barrier.[2] Hermanski died in Homosassa Springs, Florida,
