As player As manager Frederick Francis Mitchell, born Frederick Francis 
Yapp (June 5, 1878 â€“ October 13, 1970), was an American right-handed pitcher, 
catcher, first baseman and manager in Major League Baseball. After pitching 
for the Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Athletics, Philadelphia Phillies, 
and Brooklyn Superbas from 1901 to 1905, he returned to the major leagues 
as a catcher for the New York Highlanders in 1910. He was noted for relieving 
Hall of Famer Cy Young in the first-ever Red Sox game. Mitchell was born 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1917, he joined the Chicago Cubs as team 
president, and was later hired as manager. In his second year at the helm, 
he won the 1918 National League pennant, losing to the Red Sox in the 1918 
World Series. However, in the middle of the 1919 season, he was relieved

thirty years until his retirement. Mitchell was best known for his excellence
