As player As manager Stanley Raymond "Bucky" Harris (November 8, 1896 – 
November 8, 1977) was an American Major League Baseball player, manager 
and executive. In 1975, the Veterans Committee elected Harris, as a manager, 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame.[1] Of Swiss and Welsh descent, Harris was 
born in Port Jervis, New York, and raised after the age of six in Pittston, 
Pennsylvania. His father, Thomas, had emigrated from Wales, while his mother, 
Catherine (Rupp), hailed from Hughestown, Pennsylvania. His elder brother, 
Merle, was a minor league second baseman. Bucky Harris left school at age 
13 to work at a local colliery, the Butler Mine, as an office boy and, 
later, a weigh master.[2] In his spare time, Harris played basketball for 
the Pittston YMCA team as well as sandlot baseball. Harris was listed as 
5 feet 9 inches (1.75 m) tall and 156 pounds (71 kg); he threw and batted 
right-handed. In 1916, when Harris was 19, Pittston native and future Hall 
of Famer Hughie Jennings, then the manager of the Detroit Tigers, signed 
him to his first contract and farmed him to the Class B Muskegon Reds of 
the Central League, where he struggled as a batsman and was released.[2] 
Harris then caught on with the Scranton Miners, Norfolk Tars and Reading 
Pretzels through 1917, before reaching the highest level of minor league 
baseball with the 1918–19 Buffalo Bisons of the International League. Harris 
improved his batting skills during the latter season with the Bisons, making 
126 hits and raising his average to .282. He then was recommended to the 
Washington Senators by baseball promoter Joe Engel, who led the Chattanooga 
Lookouts at Engel Stadium. In August 1919, at the age of 22, he came up 
to Washington but was unimpressive at first,[3] batting a meager .214 and 
getting into only eight games that first season. Despite this poor showing, 
owner-manager Clark Griffith made him Washington's regular second baseman 
in 1920, and before long Harris was batting .300 and making a mark for 
himself as a tough competitor, standing up to even ferocious superstar 
Ty Cobb, who threatened Harris when he tagged Cobb in their first encounter.[3] 
Harris spent most of his playing career as a second baseman with the Senators 
(1919–28). In 1924, he was named player-manager; at the age of 27 he was 
the youngest manager in the Majors.[3] He proceeded to lead the Senators 
to their only World Series title in Washington in his rookie season, and 
was nicknamed "The Boy Wonder."[4] He won a second consecutive American 
League pennant in 1925, but the Senators lost the 1925 World Series in 
Pittsburgh in the late innings of Game 7 after leading 3-1 in the Series.[5] 
Baseball historian William C. Kashatus wrote of his dominant play in the 
1924 World Series:[6] "Not only did he set records for chances accepted, 
double plays and put-outs in the exciting seven-game affair, but he batted 
.333 and hit two home runs".[6] His initial departure from the Senators 
in 1928 (he would twice return to manage them again from 1935–42 and 1950–54) 
came in a trade to the Tigers as player-manager.[1] However, for all intents 
and purposes, 1928 was his last year as a full-time player. He only made 
11 cameo appearances in the Tiger lineup—seven in 1929 and four in 1931. 
In all, he appeared in 1,263 games played, and collected 1,297 hits, with 
224 doubles, 64 triples, nine home runs, 472 bases on balls and 167 stolen 
bases. He batted .274 lifetime with 508 career runs batted in. In addition 
to his three separate terms as field leader of the Senators, Harris also 
managed the Tigers twice (1929–33 and 1955–56), Boston Red Sox (1934), 
Philadelphia Phillies (briefly known as the Blue Jays, 1943) and New York 
Yankees (1947–48). After his back-to-back pennants in 1924–25, Harris was 
able to keep the Senators in the first division for the next three seasons, 
but their win totals declined, from 96 (1925) to 81 (1926), 85 (1927) and 
then only 75 (against 79 losses, 1928), leading Griffith to trade Harris 
and change managers (naming Hall of Fame pitcher Walter Johnson as Harris' 
successor). The 1928 Tigers had won only 68 games, and Harris's 1929 edition 
offered only a slight improvement, winning 70. In five full seasons as 
the Tigers' manager, Harris produced only one winning year, 1932, when 
Detroit went 76–75 and finished fifth and 29½ games behind the Yankees. 
In the waning days of 1933, Harris stepped down. His eventual successor, 
Mickey Cochrane, a future Hall-of-Fame catcher who was acquired from the 
Philadelphia Athletics, would lead the Tigers as a player-manager to back-to-back 
pennants in 1934–35 (and their first-ever world championship in the latter 
year). Harris signed as manager of the Red Sox for 1934. The Red Sox were 
then a habitual tail-ender in the American League, and had registered 15 
consecutive losing seasons since their 1918 world championship. The 1933 
Red Sox had won only 63 games and finished seventh in the eight-team AL 
under Marty McManus, but their wealthy new owner, Tom Yawkey, had begun 
a major rebuilding of both the ball club and Fenway Park. Yawkey jettisoned 
McManus and personally selected Harris as his new manager, and his 1934 
Red Sox, despite an injury-riddled season by newly purchased ace left-handed 
pitcher Lefty Grove, broke the losing-season streak, finishing at .500 
(76–76). But Harris's stay in the Boston dugout lasted only one season. 
He and Eddie Collins, the Red Sox' general manager, had feuded since their 
playing days[7] and Yawkey may have hired Harris without consulting Collins. 
When Joe Cronin, the hard-hitting, 28-year-old playing manager of the Senators, 
became available on the trade market, Yawkey and Collins moved quickly, 
sending shortstop Lyn Lary and $225,000 to Washington on October 26[8] 
for Cronin, and then naming him manager for 1935. Harris then took Cronin's 
old job, returning to Clark Griffith and the Senators. Harris's second 
term in Washington lasted for eight seasons (1935–42), his longest tenure 
as a skipper, but produced no repeats of 1924–25. Only one of Harris's 
teams, the 1936 Senators, had a winning record (82–71) and first-division 
finish. Harris kept the club out of the American League basement, but three 
consecutive seventh-place finishes (1940–42) led to his departure and his 
only season in the National League as skipper of the 1943 Phillies. Perhaps 
the worst team (42–109, .278) in baseball in 1942, the Phillies had just 
been sold to lumberman William D. Cox. Under Harris, the 1943 edition improved 
to play .424 baseball (39–53), but on July 27, the manager was abruptly 
fired. Harris then played a role in Cox' banishment from professional baseball 
for betting on games. Harris's friends, outraged at his firing, informed 
Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis that Cox was violating 
baseball's anti-gambling mandate.[9] Landis then summoned Harris to his 
office to testify in person about Cox' behavior; the owner was suspended 
indefinitely three months later, and the Phillies were sold to R. R. M. 
Carpenter in November 1943. Harris then spent three seasons out of the 
Major Leagues as general manager (1944–46) and field manager (in 1944–45) 
of the Buffalo Bisons, his old team in the International League. In August 
1946, the Yankees' co-owner and GM, Larry MacPhail, appointed Harris to 
a front-office position. The tumultuous 1946 season saw MacPhail employ 
three managers—Joe McCarthy, Bill Dickey and Johnny Neun—and finish third, 
17 games in arrears of the pennant-winning Red Sox. At the close of the 
season, MacPhail named Harris the Bombers' 1947 manager, and he led them 
to his third American League pennant, and the Yankees' 15th league title. 
Behind Most Valuable Player Joe DiMaggio and newly acquired starting pitcher 
Allie Reynolds, the 1947 Yanks won 97 games and prevailed over the Tigers 
by a 12-game margin. Then they won Harris's second World Series championship 
when they defeated the Jackie Robinson-led Brooklyn Dodgers in a thrilling, 
seven-game Fall Classic. Harris returned to the Yankees in 1948. His 1948 
club won 94 games to finish a close third in a hectic pennant race, two 
games behind the Cleveland Indians and Red Sox, who ended the regular season 
in a tie for first place.[1] But the result dissatisfied the Yankees' post-MacPhail 
ownership team, Dan Topping and Del Webb, and their new general manager, 
George Weiss, and they replaced Harris with Casey Stengel. Stengel would 
lead New York to ten American League pennants and seven World Series titles 
in the next 12 seasons. Harris returned to the minor leagues in 1949 as 
manager of the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League before launching 
his third stint as skipper of the Senators, coming off a 104-loss 1949 
season. He led them to a 17-game improvement in 1950, and to a winning 
(78–76) mark in 1952, but the Senators could not escape the second division 
in Harris's five-year, final term as Washington's manager. Nevertheless, 
the Tigers chose Harris to replace Fred Hutchinson as their manager for 
1955, and in the first season of his second term in Detroit, Harris again 
produced a turnaround. The 1955 Tigers won 79 games (eleven more than in 
1954) and had their first above-.500 season since 1950, then won 82 games 
in 1956. But the Tigers finished fifth each season, and were experiencing 
turmoil in their front office: outspoken owner Walter Briggs, Jr., was 
harshly critical of Harris and his coaches during the season[10] and was 
in the process of selling the team.[11] Fired by new owner Fred Knorr, 
Harris closed out his 29-year MLB managing career with a win-loss record 
of 2,158–2,219 (.493). As of 2014, Harris ranked seventh in MLB manager 
career wins. In 1957, he rejoined the Red Sox as assistant general manager 
and then, at 62, succeeded Joe Cronin as GM in January 1959—24 years after 
Cronin had displaced Harris as Boston's field manager. Harris served for 
two losing seasons as general manager of the Red Sox before his firing 
in late September 1960. On his watch, the Bosox finally broke their own 
baseball color line by promoting Pumpsie Green from Triple-A on July 21, 
1959, more than twelve years after Robinson's debut with the Dodgers.[13] 
But the Red Sox went 75–79 in 1959 and fell into the second division, beginning 
a streak of eight straight losing seasons. Then, in 1960, Hall of Famer 
Ted Williams's final season, they won only 65 games and finished seventh 
in the eight-team league. Rightfielder Jackie Jensen, 1958 American League 
MVP and the AL's 1959 runs batted in leader, sat out the entire 1960 campaign 
in retirement due to his fear of flying. Harris's two highest-profile trades 
saw him send left-handed pitcher and former bonus baby Frank Baumann to 
the Chicago White Sox and catcher Sammy White to the Indians. But Baumann 
led the AL in earned run average with the 1960 Chisox (while the player 
Harris obtained, first baseman Ron Jackson, played only ten games with 
Boston before being traded away again) and White abruptly retired rather 
than report to Cleveland, canceling his trade.[14] Harris also ran afoul 
of Yawkey when he fired Yawkey associate Pinky Higgins as manager and replaced 
him with Billy Jurges, a Senators' coach, on July 3, 1959, without consulting 
the owner.[13] Jurges lasted less than a calendar year as the Red Sox' 
pilot before his firing in June 1960—and replacement by Higgins. Harris 
ended his long MLB career as a scout for the White Sox (1961–62) and special 
assistant for the new expansion Washington Senators franchise that played 
in D.C. from 1961 to 1971 before moving on to Arlington, Texas. He died 
in Bethesda, Maryland, on his 81st birthday, and was buried at St. Peter's 
Lutheran Church in Hughestown, Pennsylvania. Harris's father-in-law during 
his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1951, was Howard Sutherland,
