Ricardo Rincón Espinoza (born April 13, 1970) is a former Major League 
Baseball relief pitcher. Rincón was a left-handed specialist who spent 
nearly his entire career as a middle reliever and setup pitcher. In his 
10-year career, Rincón never started a game and only accumulated 21 saves. 
Rincón played for several teams in Mexico before being signed by the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in 1997, breaking into the major leagues at the relatively advanced 
age of 27. On November 18, 1998 he was traded to the Cleveland Indians 
for outfielder Brian Giles. He later pitched for the Oakland Athletics 
and St. Louis Cardinals. Rincón played for his native Mexico in the 2006 
World Baseball Classic, appearing in four games.[1] Shortly after the Classic 
and five games into his Cardinal career, Rincón experienced shoulder pain 
and later underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum and rotator cuff. He 
also had Tommy John surgery on his left elbow, forcing him to miss the 
remainder of the 2006 season.[2] He played in the San Francisco Giants 
organization in 2007. On January 25, 2008, Rincón signed with the New York 
Mets. He was loaned to the Mexico City Red Devils for the 2008 season, 
and was returned on August 28 and assigned to Triple-A New Orleans. Rincón 
was part of a combined no-hitter on July 12, 1997. After Francisco Córdova 
threw nine innings of no-hit ball, Rincón relieved him and pitched a scoreless 
10th. Teammate Mark Smith then hit a three-run walk-off home run in the 
bottom of the 10th to give Rincón the win.[3] To date, it is the last no-hitter 
in Pirates history. [1] He throws a four-seam fastball, slider, changeup, 
and two-seam fastball. He is currently married to his wife Jaqueline, they 
have two children, a daughter, Damaris, and a son, Ricardo, Jr. He is mentioned
