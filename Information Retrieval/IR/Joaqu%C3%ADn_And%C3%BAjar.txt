Joaquín Andújar (/ænˈduːhɑːr/ an-DOO-har; December 21, 1952 – September 
8, 2015) was a Dominican professional baseball pitcher who played in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros, St. Louis Cardinals and Oakland 
Athletics from 1976 through 1988. Andújar was a four-time MLB All-Star 
and a Gold Glove Award winner.[1] Andújar signed with the Cincinnati Reds 
in 1969, one month shy of his seventeenth birthday. He posted a 33–41 record 
with a 4.33 earned run average over six seasons in the Reds' farm system. 
Following the 1975 season, he was dealt to the Houston Astros for two players 
to be named later. Andújar made his major league debut in the 1976 season 
opener against his former franchise.[2] After two relief appearances against 
the Reds, he was moved into the starting rotation. On July 11 and July 
17, Andújar pitched consecutive 1–0 shutouts against the Montreal Expos[3] 
and New York Mets.[4] For the season, he went 9–10 with a 3.60 ERA. Andújar 
was 10–5 with a 3.47 ERA at the 1977 All-Star break to be named the Astros' 
sole representative in the All-Star game. However, he injured himself in 
his final start before the game and could not play.[5] He did not return 
to his team until September, and finished the season 11–8 with a 3.69 ERA. 
Andújar began seeing more work out of the bullpen in 1978 and earned his 
first career save on August 25 against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[6] He began 
the 1979 season in the bullpen, and was 4–2 with a 3.23 ERA with three 
saves and two blown saves when he was added back to the starting rotation. 
He responded with four consecutive complete game victories in which he 
gave up just one earned run per game. He was named to his second National 
League All-Star team, and pitched two innings while giving up two runs 
(one earned).[7] On August 14, he pitched a four-hit complete game against 
the Montreal Expos while hitting an inside-the-park home run to account 
for both of the Astros' runs in a 2-1 win.[8] He went 3–8 in 1980 splitting 
time between starts and relief appearances. The Astros won a one-game playoff 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers to send Andújar to his first postseason. 
He recorded a save in Game Two of the 1980 National League Championship 
Series against the Philadelphia Phillies.[9] After starting the 1981 season 
2–3 with a 4.94 ERA, he was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals for Tony Scott 
just before the players' strike. Andújar returned to a starting role with 
the Cardinals and responded by going 6–1 for the rest of the 1981 season. 
In 1982, he pitched a career high 265 2⁄3 innings. He won his last seven 
decisions, and had a 1.64 ERA down the stretch to finish the season at 
15–10. He pitched a three-hit shutout of the Philadelphia Phillies at Veterans 
Stadium on September 15 that put his team 1 1⁄2 games up on the Phillies 
in the National League East,[10] a lead they held for the remainder of 
the season. The Cards swept the Atlanta Braves in the 1982 National League 
Championship Series, with Andújar starting and winning Game Three.[11] 
He started two games in the 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, 
winning both with a 1.35 ERA. He was taken off the field during Game Three 
after he was hit in the leg by a line drive. St. Louis manager Whitey Herzog 
later said that he thought Andújar had been killed by the batted ball, 
but Andújar recovered in time to start the seventh game.[12] Andújar had 
a career year in 1984. He was 13–6 with a 2.90 ERA at the All-Star break 
to earn his third All-Star selection, but was unable to attend. He ended 
the season at 20–14 with a 3.34 ERA, leading the league in wins, innings 
pitched (261.1) and shutouts (4) while winning the Gold Glove Award at 
his position. In 1982 and 1984, he led the Cardinals in wins, ERA, games 
started, complete games, innings pitched, shutouts, and strikeouts.[13] 
Andújar got off to a 12–1 start in 1985, and made his fourth All-Star team. 
The Cardinals and New York Mets became embroiled in a heated battle for 
the NL East crown that came down to the wire. Andújar went 3–1 with a 4.29 
ERA against the Mets that season. Perhaps the most memorable game Andújar 
pitched in the rivalry that developed between the two clubs was a 5–2 loss 
on October 2 against Dwight Gooden that allowed the Mets to pull within 
a game of the Cardinals.[14] The Cardinals won the following day, and ended 
up taking the division by three games over the Mets. Andújar ended the 
season at 21–12 with a 3.40 ERA. In the 1985 National League Championship 
Series, He was ineffective in his Game Two start against the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, putting the Cards in a two-game hole.[15] St. Louis came back 
to win the following four games (with Andújar starting the decisive Game 
Six, but not figuring in the decision)[16] to head to the World Series. 
Between 1982 and 1985, Andújar averaged over 36 games started per season. 
A major league pitcher has not had more than 36 starts for one season since 
Greg Maddux started 37 games in 1991.[17][18] The World Series against 
the Kansas City Royals went poorly for Andújar. He lasted four plus innings 
in Game Three, and took the loss opposite a dominant Bret Saberhagen.[19] 
John Tudor, meanwhile, was 3–1 with a 1.59 ERA that post-season, leading 
Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog to go with Tudor in the decisive Game Seven 
despite the fact that Andújar was on five days rest. The strategy failed, 
as Tudor was pulled in the third with the bases loaded and three runs already 
on the board. The score was 10–0 by the time Herzog brought Andújar in 
for mop-up duty.[20] When umpire Don Denkinger called a ball, Andújar emphatically 
showed his disagreement, and had to be restrained by teammates. Herzog 
exploded and was ejected. A pitch later, Andújar was ejected by Denkinger 
(who misread a gesture by Andújar to catcher Darrell Porter) and again 
had to be held back by his teammates. Some[who?] believe that Herzog purposely 
sent the volatile Andújar to the mound as payback for Denkinger's infamous 
call in Game Six. Before getting ejected by Denkinger in the seventh game, 
Herzog said to him, "We wouldn't even be here if you hadn't missed the 
f***ing call last night!" However, Herzog has often stated Andújar was 
his only pitcher that still had any life left in his arm. Andújar was so 
furious after being ejected from Game Seven that he took a baseball bat 
and demolished a toilet in the visitor's clubhouse bathroom in Kansas City's 
Royals Stadium.[21] As a result of this, Andújar was fined several thousands 
of dollars, plus suspended from playing for a month and a half for the 
following regular season. During that winter's meetings, the Cardinals 
dealt Andújar to the Oakland Athletics for Tim Conroy and Mike Heath. He 
was to begin the 1986 season serving a ten-game suspension (later reduced 
to five) for the World Series altercation with Denkinger. On top of that, 
on February 28, 1986, Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth handed down 
season-long suspensions to Andújar, who had also dealt drugs to then-Cardinals 
teammate Lonnie Smith in 1982, and six other players who had admitted to 
cocaine abuse during the Pittsburgh drug trials.[22] The suspensions were 
reduced to anti-drug donations and community service. As luck would have 
it, Denkinger was the home plate umpire for Andújar's first start of 1986. 
It was uneventful, as Andújar lasted just four plus innings while giving 
up six earned runs.[23] Despite his start to the season, Andújar had a 
decent year in 1986, going 12–7 with a 3.82 ERA. He suffered numerous injuries 
along the way, including an injury sustained during batting practice even 
though pitchers do not bat in the American League. Injuries limited Andújar 
to 13 starts in 1987. The last start was on August 3, and he lasted just 
two-thirds of an inning, giving up three runs.[24] Andújar returned to 
the Astros to be part of their bullpen for 1988, but he made some starts 
in the middle of the season due to injuries in the starting rotation. He 
ended the season at 2–5 with a 4.00 ERA. He earned a 5-0 record in the 
Senior Professional Baseball Association (SPBA) in late 1989.[25] When 
he was signed by the Montreal Expos on December 11, he became the first 
SPBA player to sign with an MLB club.[17][25] He was released by the Expos 
the following March.[17] After retiring from baseball, Andújar started 
a trucking business in the Dominican Republic.[12] He died at his home 
on September 8, 2015 in San Pedro de Macorís, from complications of diabetes.[26] 
In 2012, Andújar gained induction into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame.
