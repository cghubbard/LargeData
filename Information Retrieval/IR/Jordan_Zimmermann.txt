Jordan M. Zimmermann (born May 23, 1986) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously 
played for the Washington Nationals. Zimmermann is a two-time MLB All-Star, 
and co-led the National League in wins in 2013. In 2014, Zimmermann pitched 
the first no-hitter in Washington Nationals history. Zimmermann was born 
in Auburndale, Wisconsin, where he played all four years of high school 
on the varsity team at Auburndale High School. He began his career as a 
catcher, then moved to multiple positions due to his versatility. He was 
used as a starting pitcher as well as a closer in tight games. Zimmermann 
attended the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, and was drafted by 
the Washington Nationals in the second round of the 2007 Major League Baseball 
Draft. In 2008, Zimmermann had a combined 10–3 record with a 2.89 earned 
run average (ERA) with the Potomac Nationals of the Class A-Advanced Carolina 
League and the Harrisburg Senators of the Class AA Eastern League, and 
in July was named to the Eastern League All-Star team. He finished the 
season leading the organization in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average, 
and was the MILB.com Nationals pitcher of the year.[1] Zimmermann was rated 
the Nationals' best prospect going into the 2009 MLB season, according 
to Baseball America.[2] In 2009, Zimmermann made the Nationals' roster 
as the fifth starter; however, the Nationals did not need him in the rotation 
until mid-April, so Zimmermann opened the season with the Triple-A Syracuse 
Chiefs.[3] Zimmermann's contract was purchased on April 20, 2009, and he 
made his major league debut that night, after a two-plus hour rain delay, 
against the Atlanta Braves. He pitched six innings, allowing two runs on 
six hits, with three strikeouts and a walk, earning the victory.[4] In 
his second game against the New York Mets, Zimmermann won his second game 
in as many starts becoming the first Nationals/Expos pitcher to win his 
first two starts of his career since Randy Johnson did so in 1988.[5] Coincidentally, 
Zimmermann was the losing pitcher in Johnson's historic 300th win on June 
4, 2009.[6] Zimmermann experienced elbow pain, and in July landed on the 
disabled list.[7] After attempted rehab, in August 2009 Zimmermann was 
diagnosed with a torn ulnar collateral ligament and underwent Tommy John 
surgery, expecting to miss 18 months.[7] He finished his rookie season 
of 2009 going 3–5 with a 4.63 ERA in 16 starts. In 2010 he made quick progress. 
Over four minor league levels, he started 10 games in limited play, racking 
up just 39.2 innings, but compiling a solid record: 1.59 ERA, 27 hits allowed, 
31 strikeouts, and just six walks.[8] On August 26 he was recalled to make 
his 2010 debut back in the big leagues, where Zimmermann got a no-decision 
in an eventual win by the Nationals over the Cardinals. On this same day, 
the Nationals learned that their other young pitching phenom, Stephen Strasburg, 
would need Tommy John surgery and would be out for 12–18 months. In Zimmermann's 
second return start, however, five days later, he pitched six shutout innings, 
allowing only one hit, no walks, and striking out nine, a personal best. 
He also became the first National to get through six innings facing only 
18 batters.[9] Zimmermann finished the 2010 year 1–2 with a 4.94 ERA in 
seven starts. On May 6, 2011, Zimmermann pitched an immaculate inning versus 
the Florida Marlins at Sun Life Stadium.[10] He finished the 2011 year 
8–11 with a 3.18 ERA. On May 28, 2012, Zimmermann hit his first career 
home run off of Miami Marlins pitcher Carlos Zambrano. Zimmermann became 
the third Nationals pitcher named NL Pitcher of the Month during the 2012 
season when the selection was announced on August 2, 2012. During July 
he went 4–0 with a MLB-best 0.97 ERA. He gave up 27 hits in 37 innings 
and struck out 31 compared to 4 walks.[11] He finished the 2012 season 
12–8 with a 2.94 ERA. In Game 4 of the 2012 National League Division Series, 
Zimmermann made a relief appearance in the 7th inning, his first since 
2008 at A-level Potomac. Entering a tie game, Zimmermann struck out the 
side.[12] The Nationals would eventually lose the series to the St. Louis 
Cardinals after Game 5. Zimmermann hurled his first career shutout on April 
26, 2013, with a one-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds. It was the second 
straight one-hitter by Nationals pitching in the series, marking the first 
occasion since 1917 that a Washington team achieved that streak, and the 
first time since 1900 that the Reds were victimized that way.[13] In 2013, 
Zimmermann was named to his first All-Star Game, but chose not to play 
due to stiffness in his neck. He finished the season with a career high 
in wins, going 19–9, while also posting a 3.25 ERA over 32 starts. On September 
28, 2014, the last day of the regular season, Zimmermann threw the first 
no-hitter in Washington Nationals history, a 1–0 win over the Miami Marlins 
and Henderson Alvarez, the pitcher who threw the final no-hitter of the 
2013 season. Zimmermann faced only one over the minimum in the game; only 
a fifth inning walk to Justin Bour and a seventh inning third strike wild 
pitch that allowed Garrett Jones (who was subsequently picked off)[14] 
to reach first base separated him from a perfect game. This was also the 
first time in MLB history that a no-hitter had been thrown on the final 
day in two consecutive seasons.[15] He finished the season with a 14–5 
record and a 2.66 ERA. Zimmermann finished the 2015 season with a record 
of 13–10 along with a 3.66 ERA, 1.205 WHIP and 164 strikeouts in 201 2⁄3 
innings pitched. Following the season, he became one of a record 20 players 
to receive a qualifying offer.[16] On November 30, 2015, the Detroit Tigers 
signed Zimmermann to a five-year, $110 million contract.[17] Zimmermann 
was named the American League Pitcher of the Month for April. During the 
month of April, Zimmermann allowed just two earned runs in 33 innings pitched, 
for a 0.55 ERA. He was 5–0, becoming the sixth pitcher to finish April 
with five-plus wins, zero losses and a sub-1.00 ERA. He joins Fernando 
Valenzuela (1981), Randy Johnson (2000), Cliff Lee (2008), Zack Greinke 
(2009), and Ubaldo Jiménez (2010). Zimmermann's 0.55 ERA is the third-best 
mark for April in Tigers history. The only two Detroit pitchers with better 
ERAs in April were Bernie Boland with a 0.30 ERA in 1915 and John Hiller 
with a 0.36 ERA in 1974.[18][19] On July 4, he was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list due to a neck strain.[20] Zimmermann is mainly a three-pitch 
pitcher. He throws a four-seam fastball at 94 miles per hour (151 km/h) 
that tops out at 98 miles per hour (158 km/h), a slider which he describes 
as a "baby cutter"[21] (86 miles per hour (138 km/h)), and a curveball 
(77 miles per hour (124 km/h)). On rare occasions, he also features a circle
