of the National Honor Society.[1] Melancon was drafted by the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in the 30th round of the 2003 Major League Baseball draft.[2] He 
declined the offer so that he could attend the University of Arizona.[1] 
As a member of the Arizona Wildcats baseball team, Melancon appeared in 
29 games (a single-season freshman record) and played in 5 post-season

that summer.[1] In his sophomore year he worked as a closing pitcher, achieving 
11 saves (a single-season record) in 34 appearances. He played a shortened 
season in 2006 due to a strained elbow ligament, and had a college career 
total of 18 saves.[1] Melancon was drafted by the New York Yankees in the

minor league affiliates: the Single-A Tampa Yankees, Double-A Trenton Thunder 
and Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees, going 8–1 with a 2.27 ERA in 
41 relief appearances, holding batters to a .202 batting average. Following 
the season, Baseball America rated him the organization's ninth best prospect.[4] 
Melancon was called up to the majors for the first time on April 25, 2009.[5] 
He made his major league debut as a relief pitcher against the Boston Red 
Sox on April 26, pitching two scoreless innings. He was optioned back to 
Triple-A on May 8, and recalled on July 9.[6] Melancon played in 13 games

the Phillies.[citation needed] Melancon started the 2010 season in the 
minors and made 2 appearances in the Majors accumulating an ERA of 9.00 
in 2 relief appearances with the Yankees. Melancon was traded along with

was traded to the Boston Red Sox for infielder Jed Lowrie and starter Kyle 
Weiland.[8] After only his first four appearances in 2012, where his ERA 
was 49.50, Melancon was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket on April 18, the 
day after he gave up six runs, including three home runs, without recording 
an out against the Texas Rangers.[9] Melancon was recalled June 10 after 
an injury to Rich Hill. During his time in the Majors with the Red Sox 
in 2012, Melancon finished the season 0–2 and a 6.20 ERA and 1 save in 
41 appearances. On December 26, 2012, the Red Sox traded Melancon, Stolmy 
Pimentel, Jerry Sands and Iván DeJesús Jr. to the Pittsburgh Pirates for 
Brock Holt and Joel Hanrahan.[10][11] Melancon began the 2013 season as 
a setup reliever, with Jason Grilli as the closer.[12] He was selected 
as an All Star as a setup man in 2013, the first selection of his career. 
After Grilli went on the disabled list, Melancon was named the acting closer 
for the Pirates. Melancon had a 1.39 ERA, a 3–2 record, and 16 saves. In 
Game 3 of the 2013 National League Division Series, Melancon got his first 
career postseason win, but the Pirates lost the series to the St. Louis 
Cardinals after a deciding five games. Melancon avoided arbitration with 
the Pirates by signing a one-year contract worth $2.95 million for the 
2014 season.[13] He started the 2014 season as the Pirates setup reliever. 
He served as a closer for two weeks while Grilli was on the disabled list.[14] 
However, Melancon was named the Pirates new permanent closer after Grilli 
was traded to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in June 2014. Melancon 
finished his 2014 campaign posting a 3–5 record with a 1.90 ERA and converting 
33 saves in 37 opportunities.[citation needed] The Pirates agreed to pay 
Melancon $5.4 million for the 2015 season.[15][16] Starting the 2015 season 
as the Pirates' closer, Melancon was named an All Star for the second time 
in his career, and his first as a closer. He recorded his 100th career 
save against the Kansas City Royals and surpassed Mike Williams to become 
the all-time Pirates single-season saves leader, recording his 47th of 
the season on September 19.[17] He finished the season with a league-leading 
51 saves and won the 2015 National League Reliever of the Year Award after 
the season.[18] Melancon and the Pirates agreed to a $9.65 million salary 
for the 2016 season, his final year of arbitration eligibility.[19][20] 
Melancon was named to the National League's 2016 All-Star roster, his second 
straight All-Star appearance and his third overall.[21] On July 30, 2016, 
the Pirates traded Melancon to the Washington Nationals for Felipe Rivero 
and Taylor Hearn.[22] He secured his first save as a National on August 
7 against the San Francisco Giants.[23] Melancon is a control pitcher with 
a low-90s cut fastball, a common high-70s to low-80s knuckle curve with
