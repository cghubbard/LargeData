The Aberdeen IronBirds are a Short-Season A classification affiliate of 
the Baltimore Orioles. The IronBirds play in the New York–Penn League and 
are based in the city of Aberdeen in Harford County, Maryland. The team 
is currently owned by retired Oriole Cal Ripken, Jr.. Ripken Jr. purchased 
the team, then known as the Utica Blue Sox, and moved them to his hometown 
of Aberdeen in time for the 2002 season. The IronBirds play their home 
games at Leidos Field at Ripken Stadium, which is visible from I-95. On 
August 16, 2006, the IronBirds played host to the New York–Penn League 
All-Star Game. Leidos Field at Ripken Stadium was also used for the Cal 
Ripken World Series in 2003 and 2004, forcing the team to go on extended 
road trips, 20 or more games, during the youth competition. The Cal Ripken 
World Series moved across the street to Cal Sr.'s Yard in 2005. The name 
"IronBirds" was chosen for two reasons: Cal Ripken's "Ironman" streak of 
2,632 consecutive baseball games played and the team's affiliation with 
the Orioles (the Baltimore team is often referred to as "The Birds").[1] 
The former team logo featured a silver airplane marked with Ripken's number 
8, which also refers to the nearby Aberdeen Proving Ground U.S. Army installation. 
The team mascots are gray birds named Ferrous and Ripcord. The record of 
most RBIs in a single month was set by Robbie Widlansky in July 2008. On 
August 26, 2013, Conor Bierfeldt hit his 12th home run of the season, setting 
a new IronBirds single-season record. He broke the previous record held 
by David Anderson set in the 2010 season. On September 2, 2013, The IronBirds 
clinched their first McNamara Division Title. Pitchers Catchers Infielders
