There have been 15 captains of the New York Yankees, an American professional 
baseball franchise also known previously as the New York Highlanders. The 
position is currently vacant after the most recent captain, Derek Jeter, 
retired after the 2014 season, after 12 seasons as team captain. Jeter 
was named as the 11th officially recognized captain of the Yankees in 2003.[1] 
In baseball, the captain formerly served as the on-field leader of the 
team, while the manager operated the team from the dugout. Today, the captain 
is a clubhouse leader. The first captain officially recognized by the Yankees 
was Hal Chase, who served in the role from 1910 through 1912. Roger Peckinpaugh 
served as captain from 1914 through 1922, until he was traded to the Boston 
Red Sox.[2] He was succeeded by Babe Ruth,[2] who was quickly deposed as 
captain for climbing into the stands to confront a heckler.[3] Everett 
Scott served as captain from 1922 through 1925. Ten years later, Lou Gehrig 
was named captain, serving for the remainder of his career. After the death 
of Gehrig, then manager Joe McCarthy declared that the Yankees would never 
have another captain.[4] The position remained vacant until team owner 
George Steinbrenner named Thurman Munson as captain in 1976.[5] Following 
Munson's death, Graig Nettles served as captain. Willie Randolph and Ron 
Guidry were named co-captains in 1986. Don Mattingly followed them as captain 
in 1991, serving until his retirement in 1995. Gehrig, Munson, Guidry, 
Mattingly and Jeter are the only team captains who spent their entire career 
with the Yankees. Jeter is the longest tenured captain in franchise history, 
the 2014 season being his 12th as team captain. There is, however, some 
controversy over the official list. Howard W. Rosenberg, a baseball historian, 
found that the official count of Yankees captains failed to include Clark 
Griffith, the captain from 1903–1905, and Kid Elberfeld, the captain from 
1906–1907, while manager Frank Chance may have served as captain in 1913.[6][7] 
In addition, right after The New York Times reported Rosenberg's research 
in 2007, Society for American Baseball Research member Clifford Blau contacted 
him to say he had found Willie Keeler being called the team's captain in 
1908 and 1909, research that Rosenberg has confirmed.[8] Names in bold
