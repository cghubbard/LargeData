The Chicago Cubs are a Major League Baseball franchise based in Chicago. 
They play in the National League Central division. Also known in their 
early years as the "Chicago White Stockings" (1876–89), "Chicago Colts" 
(1890–97), and "Chicago Orphans" (1898–1902),[1] pitchers for the Cubs 
have thrown 15 no-hitters in franchise history.[2] A no-hitter is officially 
recognized by Major League Baseball only “when a pitcher (or pitchers) 
allows no hits during the entire course of a game, which consists of at 
least nine innings”.[3] No-hitters of fewer than nine complete innings 
were previously recognized by the league as official; however, several 
rule alterations in 1991 changed the rule to its current form.[4] No Cubs 
pitcher has yet pitched a perfect game. The closest performance came on 
September 2, 1972, when Milt Pappas lost his perfect game bid against the 
San Diego Padres with two outs in the ninth by allowing a walk to Larry 
Stahl on a 3–2 count; he retired the next batter to finish the no-hitter.[5] 
During that at-bat, he was ahead of the batter with a 0–2 count before 
throwing four straight close pitches to allow the walk. Larry Corcoran 
threw the first no-hitter in Cubs history on August 19, 1880; the most 
recent no-hitter was thrown by Jake Arrieta on April 21, 2016.[5] Two left-handed 
pitchers have thrown no-hitters in franchise history while nine were by 
right-handers. Corcoran, Arrieta, and Ken Holtzman are the only pitchers 
in Cubs history to throw more than one no-hitter. Corcoran threw three 
and Arrieta and Holtzman threw two. Ten no-hitters were thrown at home 
and five on the road. Two occurred in April, two in May, two in June, one 
in July, five in August, and three in September. The longest interval between 
no-hitters was between the games pitched by Jimmy Lavender and Sam Jones, 
encompassing 39 years, 8 months, and 12 days from August 31, 1915, until 
May 12, 1955. The shortest interval in days between no-hitters was between 
the games pitched by Burt Hooton and Milt Pappas, encompassing four months 
and sixteen days from April 16, 1972, until September 2, 1972.[5] The shortest 
interval in games between no-hitters was between the games pitched by Jake 
Arrieta on August 30, 2015, and April 21, 2016, 49 regular-season games. 
(The Cubs also played nine postseason games in October 2015, between these 
two no-hitters.)[6][7] Cubs pitchers have thrown two no-hitters against 
the Atlanta Braves and their predecessors – one by Corcoran in 1880 and 
one by Holtzman in 1969. They also threw two no-hitters against the Cincinnati 
Reds: Holtzman in 1971, Arrieta in 2016. The Cubs have not allowed a single 
run in any of their no-hitters. The most baserunners allowed in a no-hitter 
was seven each by Jones (in 1955) and Hooton (in 1972). Of the fifteen 
no-hitters, four have been won by a score of 4–0, more than any other score. 
The largest margin of victory in a no-hitter (and the largest margin of 
victory in an MLB no-hitter since 1900) was a 16–0 win by Arrieta in 2016. 
The smallest margin of victory was a 1–0 win by Holtzman in 1971. A different 
umpire presided over each of the franchise's 15 no-hitters. Nine different
