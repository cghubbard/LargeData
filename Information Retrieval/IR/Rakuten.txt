Rakuten, Inc. (楽天株式会社, Rakuten Kabushiki-gaisha?) is a Japanese electronic 
commerce and Internet company based in Tokyo, Japan. Its B2B2C[3] e-commerce 
platform Rakuten Ichiba is the largest e-commerce site in Japan and among 
the world’s largest by sales.[4] Hiroshi Mikitani founded the company in 
February 1997 as MDM, Inc., and is still its chief executive. Rakuten Shopping 
Mall (楽天市場, Rakuten Ichiba?) started operations in May 1997. In June 1999, 
the company changed its name to Rakuten, Inc. The Japanese word rakuten 
means optimism.[5] In 2012, the company's revenues totaled US$4.6 billion 
with operating profits of about US$244 million.[6] In June 2013, Rakuten, 
Inc. reported it had a total of 10,351 employees worldwide.[7] In 2005, 
Rakuten started expanding outside Japan, mainly through acquisitions and 
joint ventures.[8] Its acquisitions include Buy.com (now Rakuten.com Shopping 
in the US), Priceminister (France), Ikeda (now Rakuten Brasil), Tradoria 
(now Rakuten Deutschland), Play.com (UK), Wuaki.tv (Spain), and Kobo Inc. 
(Canada).[9] The company has investments in Pinterest,[10] Ozon.ru,[11] 
AHA Life,[12] and Daily Grommet.[13] In 2015, Rakuten relocated its corporate 
headquarters from Shinagawa to the Tamagawa neighbourhood of Setagaya, 
to consolidate its Tokyo offices and to accommodate future growth[14] The 
Rakuten Group consists in total of around forty businesses & services such 
as - The group's 2010 annual report shows that its online shopping business, 
Rakuten Ichiba, was Japan's largest online shopping mall, offering customers 
more than 95 million products from about 40,000 merchants.[15][16] It also 
had 9 million credit card customers and more than 75 million users in Japan.[16] 
As part of the group's globalization initiative, Rakuten Ichiba started 
offering international shipping. In October 2005, Rakuten bought a 15% 
stake in Tokyo Broadcasting System, raising its stake in the broadcaster 
to 19%.[17] Rakuten later withdrew its bid and sold its shareholding back 
to Tokyo Broadcasting.[18][19] Rakuten bought New York City-based Linkshare 
- since rebranded "Rakuten Linkshare" - offering performance-based online 
sales and marketing programs.[20][21][22][23] To increase its global competitiveness, 
Rakuten decided to adopt English as the company’s official language from 
mid-2012.[24][25] That year, Rakuten also bought French online retailer 
Priceminister for €200 million[26] and US-based Buy.com for US$250 million.[27][28] 
The group had been a significant shareholder in Ctrip, a Chinese travel 
site until it sold its stake in the company in August 2007 and, in 2010, 
it announced a joint venture with Baidu in China (Lekutian).[29][30] After 
launching Indonesia's Rakuten Belanja Online, a joint venture in June the 
group continued its global growth the same month, snapping up Brazilian 
e-commerce firm Ikeda — since, renamed Rakuten Brazil. In July, it bought 
German e-commerce start-up Tradoria and rebranded it Rakuten Deutschland, 
and in September UK online retailer and e-commerce marketplace Play.com 
for £25 million (almost $41 million). After a 2010 UK government decision 
to impose Value Added Tax on UK-based companies' sales from the Channel 
Islands - until then exempt from the tax on shipments of goods worth less 
than £18 (about $28)[31] - Rakuten closed one of three Play.com warehouses 
on the island of Jersey.[32] In September, Rakuten took a minority equity 
stake in Russian online retailer Ozon.ru,dubbed 'Russia's Amazon', which 
had reported 2010 sales worth US$137 million.[33] A four-company-strong 
consortium, led by the Japanese group, invested US$100 million. Rakuten's 
stake was not revealed.[34] Rakuten announced an agreement to buy Canadian 
e-book reader company Kobo in November,[35][36] with the deal finalized 
in January 2012.[37] On 17 May, Rakuten announced that it was leading consortium 
investing $100 million in the Pinterest picture sharing social network — 
its partners were existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Bessemer Venture 
Partners, and FirstMark Capital, and a number of investment 'angels'. That 
investment marked the start of a drive to expand Pinterest's presence in 
Japan and Rakuten’s 17 other global markets. "While some may see e-commerce 
as a straightforward vending machine-like experience, we believe it is 
a living process where both retailers and consumers can communicate, discover, 
and curate to make the experience more entertaining," said Hiroshi Mikitani, 
Rakuten chief executive.[38] On 13 June, Rakuten bought Wuaki.tv, a Spanish 
video on demand (VOD) service/company that is one of the largest in Europe 
and the market leader in Spain, where it has over 600,000 registered users. 
That opened new opportunities, directly challenging Amazon, Netflix and 
others for domination of the VOD market — at first, in Europe and, later, 
elsewhere.[39] In November, Rakuten bought French online retail delivery 
company Alpha Direct Services. "Speed and quality of delivery is at the 
heart of any solid e-commerce proposition," said the Japanese group's Hiroshi 
Mikitani.[40] On 10 October, Rakuten acquired French electronic publishing 
company Aquafadas via its Kobo subsidiary to strengthen its position in 
rich media categories.[41] By late 2012, Rakuten had also moved into online 
retail in Austria, Canada, Spain, Taiwan and Thailand and into the online 
travel markets in France — with Voyager Moins Cher.com — and China, Hong 
Kong, Korea and Taiwan — with its Tokyo-based international Rakuten Travel 
platform. In North America, Rakuten Golf made booking tee time online possible.[42] 
In May 2013, Rakuten acquired a majority share in "citizen commerce" site, 
Daily Grommet,[43] since rebranded as The Grommet.[44] In June 2013, Rakuten 
announced its acquisition of U.S.-based logistics and services company 
Webgistix.[45] specializing in fulfillment technology for e-commerce retailers. 
The acquisition is Rakuten’s second logistics investment outside Japan 
and enables prompt fulfillment in the U.S. In September 2013, Rakuten acquired 
Singapore-based Viki.[46] The initiative Choice in eCommerce was founded 
on May 8, 2013 by several online retailers in Berlin, Germany.[47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55] 
The cause was, in the view of the initiative, sales bans and online restrictions 
by individual manufacturers. The dealers felt cut off from their main sales 
channel and thus deprived them the opportunity to use online platforms 
like Amazon, eBay or Rakuten in a competitive market for the benefit of 
their customers. On February 13, 2014, Rakuten announced they have acquired 
Viber for $900 million.[56] In late 2013, Rakuten Ichiba Japan launched 
a new scheme that allows US-based e-tailers to sell on Rakuten's Japanese 
E-commerce marketplace without a local address, bank account, or an entity 
based in Japan. In an effort to globalize the marketplace, Rakuten Ichiba 
is expected to welcome more international sellers in fiscal year 2014. 
On May 27, 2014, Rakuten announce that it will open the doors to its flagship, 
Kashiwa Sato designed “Rakuten CAFE” in Shibuya, Tokyo on Thursday, May 
29, 2014. The new venture will offer customers a menu featuring some of 
the most popular desserts and snacks from Rakuten Ichiba and will allow 
patrons to experience a variety of Rakuten services.[57] On May 29, 2014, 
Rakuten Marketing acquired DC Storm, a UK-based technology company which 
specializes in marketing attribution modeling and data-driven marketing.[58] 
In August 2014, Rakuten announced its purchase of Slice, a US company that 
provides online shopping services and sells business intelligence based 
on digital commerce measurement, for an undisclosed sum.[59] In September 
2014, it was revealed that Rakuten would acquire US rebate site operator 
Ebates Inc. for around $1 billion.[60] In March 2015, Rakuten has announced 
that it will soon accept Bitcoin across its global marketplaces. The company 
is putting its investment in Bitnet — a startup that raised $14.5 million 
last October — to work with this development. Bitnet, which was founded 
by ex-Visa execs and is rivaled by Coinbase and BitPay, will initially 
be integrated into Rakuten’s U.S. marketplace to allow customers to pay 
in BTC. Next up, the new payment option will roll out in Germany and Austria, 
with other international markets to follow. Interestingly, there’s no specific 
mention of when Bitnet will be integrated into Rakuten Japan, which is 
the most prominent of its 12 country-specific services.[61] On February 
12, Rakuten has confirmed that Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia marketplaces 
will be shutting down. About 150 staff are about to be laid off. The company 
did not give a specific reason for the closures, except to say that the 
moves are in line with a new roadmap.[62] One June 7, Rakuten announced 
plans to focus investment on France and Germany and restructure e-commerce 
marketplace operations in UK, Spain and Austria.[63] (source Rakuten Inc.[64]) 
In 2013, hundreds of Rakuten customers reported fraudulent credit card 
charges after making purchases from the site.[67][68] New Jersey police 
confirmed at least eight victims who were defrauded of $10,000 and had 
their social security numbers exposed and used to open accounts at online
