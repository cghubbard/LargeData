As player As manager As coach Jerry Manuel (born December 23, 1953), nicknamed 
"The Sage," is a former major league manager. He previously managed the 
Chicago White Sox from 1998 to 2003 and the New York Mets from the middle 
of 2008 to 2010 and played in the majors for parts of five seasons in the 
1970s and early 1980s. He now works as an analyst for MLB Network. Manuel 
played sparingly in the major leagues from 1975 to 1982, mostly as a second 
baseman. He accumulated only 127 at bats and a .150 batting average with 
three home runs and 13 RBIs in 96 games. Although his playing career was 
brief and stale, Manuel was the starting second baseman for the Montréal 
Expos in their only postseason series victory in 1981. He was 1-for-14 
(.071) in the series and was replaced by Rodney Scott in the NLCS. Other 
than Montréal, Manuel played for the Detroit Tigers and the San Diego Padres 
and ultimately retired in 1984.[1] In 1972, Manuel and Mike Ondina became 
the first pair of high school teammates to be drafted in the first round 
of a Major League draft. Both attended Cordova High School in Rancho Cordova, 
California. While Manuel played less than 100 games, Ondina fared even 
worse, never reaching the majors. Manuel held a variety of coaching positions 
over the next six years. He was originally hired by the Chicago White Sox 
in 1985 to scout Northern California.[1] He left the White Sox the following 
year to join the Montréal Expos organization, a team with which he would 
remain associated for the next 11 years. In 1986, Manuel joined the Expos' 
Triple-A affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association, 
as a player/coach.[2][3] Manuel spent the next three years as the Expos' 
roving infield instructor (1987) and their minor league field coordinator 
(1988–89). In 1990, Manuel became a manager for the first time as he was 
named the manager of the Southern League's Jacksonville Expos,[2] the Expos' 
Double-A affiliate. He led the team to an 84–60 record[4] and was named 
the league's manager of the year.[1] Following a successful season at Double-A, 
Manuel was elevated to Triple-A to manage the Indianapolis Indians for 
the 1991 season.[5] Midway through the campaign, he was brought up to Montréal 
to serve as the third base coach for the Expos,[2] ending a minor league 
managing career in which Manuel compiled a 112–82 record.[1] He remained 
the Expos' third base coach through the 1996 season. In 1997, he moved 
on to the Florida Marlins, where he became a bench coach under Jim Leyland. 
The team went on to win the 1997 World Series.[6] Days after the World 
Series victory, Manuel's father, Lorenzo Manuel, died.[7] Over one month 
later, in December, Manuel signed a multi-year deal to manage the Chicago 
White Sox.[1] Over the next six seasons, he amassed 500 wins and led the 
Sox to 95 in 2000 alone. In that season, Manuel guided the White Sox to 
a first-place finish in the American League's Central Division and was 
named the American League's Manager of the Year.[6] Following the 2003 
season, Manuel was replaced as White Sox manager by Ozzie Guillén. His 
2003 Topps baseball card reads: "Jerry has a philosophical air about him 
that makes him a sage influence and respected leader on his teams. After 
six seasons directing the White Soxs fortunes, he's risen to fourth on 
the franchise's managerial wins list. Formerly, he was a pro player for 
15 years and 12-year coach/Minor League manager. Manuel and Ken Williams 
form the first African-American GM/manager tandem in MLB history." After 
being released by the White Sox, Manuel joined the New York Mets in 2005 
as the first base and outfield coach under new manager Willie Randolph. 
Manuel became Randolph's bench coach in 2006, a position he remained in 
until 2008.[6] Since he was fired by the White Sox, Manuel wanted to manage 
again. But in February 2007 he announced a contingency plan—he was introduced 
as the man who would lead the formation of a baseball program at William 
Jessup University, an NAIA school in Rocklin, California. He said he would 
coach the team when it started in 2009 if he did not get another managing 
job. On June 17, 2008, Willie Randolph, pitching coach Rick Peterson, and 
first base coach Tom Nieto were fired by the Mets. Omar Minaya announced 
Manuel as the interim manager, while Ken Oberkfell, Dan Warthen, and Luis 
Aguayo were brought up from the New Orleans Zephyrs (the then-Mets' Triple-A 
affiliate) to fill the remaining coaching vacancies.[6] In 2008, the New 
York Mets were unable to hold a division lead, and ultimately the Phillies 
clinched the division on September 27. The Mets were then eliminated from 
the NL Wild Card berth the following day when the team lost to the Florida 
Marlins 4–2 in the final game at Shea Stadium. On October 3, 2008, Manuel 
agreed to a two-year deal to remain the Mets manager. The deal included 
a club option for a third year. On October 4, 2010, the Mets announced 
that both Manuel and general manager Omar Minaya would not return for the 
2011 season.[8] After leaving Major League Baseball, Manuel went back to 
his home in the Sacramento area and started the Jerry Manuel Foundation 
to "Educate African American young men with Charter School standards and 
train them in the fundamentals of baseball."[9] On January 16, 2014 it 
was announced that Manuel would be brought on as the Director of Baseball
