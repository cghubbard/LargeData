The 1993 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 111th season in Major 
League Baseball, their 36th season in San Francisco since their move from 
New York following the 1957 season, and their 34th at Candlestick Park. 
In the offseason, Barry Bonds left the Pirates to sign a lucrative free 
agent contract worth a then-record $43.75 million over 6 years with the 
Giants, with whom his father spent the first 7 years of his career, and 
with whom his godfather Willie Mays played 22 of his 24 Major League seasons. 
The deal was at that time the largest in baseball history, in terms of 
both total value and average annual salary.[1] To honor his father, Bonds 
switched his jersey number to 25 once he signed with the Giants, as it 
had been Bobby's number in San Francisco. (His number during most of his 
stay with the Pirates, 24, was retired in honor of Mays anyway).[2] Bonds 
hit .336 in 1993, leading the league with 46 home runs and 123 RBI en route 
to his second consecutive MVP award,[3] and third overall (of an eventual 
seven). As good as the Giants were (winning 103 games), the Atlanta Braves 
won 104 in what some call the last great pennant race (due to the Wild 
Card being instituted the following season).[4] After going up by nine 
games August 11 with a 77-38 record, the Giants went 12-18 and found themselves 
three-and-a-half games behind, a 12.5-game swing, by September 15. They 
then went on a 14-2 run, which left them one game behind the Braves with 
one game remaining, which they lost 12-1 to become the only National League 
team to win 100 or more games (103) and not make the playoffs in the divisional 
play era. On November 10, 1992, National League owners voted 9-4 against 
allowing Giants owner Bob Lurie to sell the team for $115 million to a 
Tampa Bay group, which would have moved the Giants to the Florida Suncoast 
Dome in time for the 1993 season.[5] During the season, John Burkett and 
Bill Swift would be the last pitchers to win at least 20 games in one season 
for the Giants in the 20th Century.[9] Infielders Other batters Coaches
