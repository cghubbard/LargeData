Arnold John "Jigger" Statz (October 20, 1897 â€“ March 16, 1988) was an American 
Major League Baseball outfielder who also had a lengthy minor league career. 
He is one of only eight players (along with Pete Rose, Ty Cobb, Julio Franco, 
Hank Aaron, Derek Jeter, Ichiro Suzuki, and Stan Musial) known to have 
amassed at least 4,000 combined hits in the major leagues and minor leagues.[1] 
Jake Beckley and Sam Crawford may also have hit 4,000, but data for some 
of their minor league seasons are missing.[2] Statz attended Holy Cross 
College in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he moved from Illinois along 
with his parents at an early age. He played baseball for two years at Holy 
Cross before enlisting in the U. S. Navy during World War I. Though he 
signed with the Giants in 1919, Statz continued his studies at Holy Cross 
and graduated with his class in 1921.[3] Jigger Statz played in the major 
leagues during eight seasons from 1919 to 1928 for the Chicago Cubs, New 
York Giants, Boston Red Sox, and Brooklyn Robins. His best season was in 
1923 with the Cubs, when he played in all 154 games, compiling a .319 batting 
average, with 10 home runs and 70 runs batted in. Statz also played 18 
minor league seasons, all of them for the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific 
Coast League. In an era when many players had lengthy minor league careers, 
Jigger Statz's statistics surpassed those of his contemporaries, e.g. a 
grand total of 4,093 major and minor league hits, and a total number of 
games played which was exceeded only by Pete Rose.[3] Statz had a distinguished 
career in the Pacific Coast League. He holds the PCL records for games 
played (2790), hits (3356), doubles (597), triples (136), and runs scored 
(1996). His career PCL batting average was .315.[4] The year after his 
playing career ended, he was a member of the first group of players elected 
to the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame.[5] Statz managed for five years 
in the minor leagues. He was the Angels' player-manager during 1940-41-42, 
and managed the Visalia Cubs of the California League in 1948-49. Jigger 
Statz played himself in the 1929 Paramount film, Fast Company, and in 1952 
served as a technical advisor for The Winning Team, a fictionalized Warner 
Bros. biography of Grover Cleveland Alexander which starred Ronald Reagan.[6]
