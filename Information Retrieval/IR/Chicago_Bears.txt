National Football League (1920–present) Dark Navy Blue, Orange, White[1][2] 
League championships (9) Conference championships (4) Division championships 
(18) The Chicago Bears are a professional American football team based 
in Chicago, Illinois. The Bears compete in the National Football League 
(NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) 
North division. The Bears have won nine NFL Championships and one Super 
Bowl and hold the NFL record for the most enshrinees in the Pro Football 
Hall of Fame and the most retired jersey numbers. The Bears have also recorded 
more regular season and overall victories than any other NFL franchise.[4][5][6] 
The franchise was founded in Decatur, Illinois, in 1919,[7] and moved to 
Chicago in 1921. It is one of only two remaining franchises from the NFL's 
founding (along with the Arizona Cardinals, which was originally also in 
Chicago). The team played home games at Wrigley Field on Chicago's North 
Side through the 1970 season; they now play at Soldier Field on the Near 
South Side, next to Lake Michigan. The Bears have a long-standing rivalry 
with the Green Bay Packers.[8] The team headquarters, Halas Hall, is in 
the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, Illinois. The Bears practice at adjoining 
facilities there during the season. They hold their annual training camp 
from late July to mid-August at Ward Field on the campus of Olivet Nazarene 
University in Bourbonnais, Illinois. In March of 1920 a man telephoned 
me ... George Chamberlain and he was general superintendent of the A.E. 
Staley Company ... In 1919, [the company's Fellowship Club] had formed 
a football team. It had done well against other local teams but Mr. Staley 
wanted to build it into a team that could compete successfully with the 
best semi-professional and industrial teams in the country ... Mr. Chamberlain 
asked if I would like to come to Decatur and work for the Staley Company. 
Originally named the Decatur Staleys, the club was established by the A. 
E. Staley food starch company of Decatur, Illinois in 1919 as a company 
team. This was the typical start for several early professional football 
franchises. The company hired George Halas and Edward "Dutch" Sternaman 
in 1920 to run the team. The 1920 Decatur Staleys season[9] was their inaugural 
regular season completed in the newly formed American Professional Football 
Association. Full control of the team was turned over to Halas and Sternaman 
in 1921.[10] Official team and league records cite Halas as the founder 
as he took over the team in 1920 when it became a charter member of the 
NFL.[11] The team relocated to Chicago in 1921, where the club was renamed 
the Chicago Staleys. Under an agreement reached by Halas and Sternaman 
with Staley, Halas purchased the rights to the club from Staley for US$100. 
In 1922, Halas changed the team name from the Staleys to the Bears. The 
team moved into Wrigley Field, which was home to the Chicago Cubs baseball 
franchise. As with several early NFL franchises, the Bears derived their 
nickname from their city's baseball team (some directly, some indirectly 
– like the Bears, whose young are called "cubs"). Halas liked the bright 
orange-and-blue colors of his alma mater, the University of Illinois, and 
the Bears adopted those colors as their own, albeit in a darker shade of 
each (the blue is a navy blue, and the orange is Pantone 1665, similar 
to burnt orange).[citation needed] The Staleys/Bears dominated the league 
in the early years. Their rivalry with the Chicago Cardinals, the oldest 
in the NFL (and a crosstown rival from 1920 to 1959), was key in four out 
of the first six league titles. During the league's first six years, the 
Bears lost twice to the Canton Bulldogs (who took two league titles over 
that span), and split with their crosstown rival Cardinals (going 4–4–2 
against each other over that span), but no other team in the league defeated 
the Bears more than a single time. During that span, the Bears posted 34 
shutouts. The Bears' rivalry with the Green Bay Packers is one of the oldest 
and most storied in American professional sports, dating back to 1921. 
In one infamous incident that year, Halas got the Packers expelled from 
the league in order to prevent their signing a particular player, and then 
graciously got them re-admitted after the Bears had closed the deal with 
that player.[12] The franchise was an early success under Halas, capturing 
the NFL Championship in 1921 and remaining competitive throughout the decade. 
In 1924 the Bears claimed the Championship after defeating the Cleveland 
Bulldogs on December 7, even putting the title "World's Champions" on their 
1924 team photo. But the NFL had ruled that games after November 30 did 
not count towards league standings, and the Bears had to settle for second 
place behind Cleveland.[13] Their only losing season came in 1929. During 
the 1920s the club was responsible for triggering the NFL's long-standing 
rule that a player could not be signed until his college's senior class 
had graduated. The NFL took that action as a consequence of the Bears' 
aggressive signing of famous University of Illinois player Red Grange within 
a day of his final game as a collegian.[14] Despite much of the on-field 
success, the Bears were a team in trouble. They faced the problem of ever-rising 
operation cost, but flatlined attendance. The Bears would only draw roughly 
5,000–6,000 fans a game, while a University of Chicago game would draw 
40,000–50,000 fans a game. By adding top college football draw Red Grange 
to the roster, the Bears knew that they found something to draw more fans 
to their games. C.C. Pyle was able to secure a $2,000 per game contract 
for Grange, and in one of the first games, the Bears defeated the Green 
Bay Packers, 21–0. However, Grange remained on the sidelines while learning 
the team's plays from Bears quarterback Joey Sternaman. Later in 1925, 
The Bears would go on a barnstorming tour, showing off the best football 
player of the day. 75,000 people paid to see Grange lead the Bears to a 
17–7 victory over the Los Angeles Tigers, who were a quickly put together 
team of West Coast college all-stars. After a loss to San Francisco, the 
Bears cruised to a 60–3 over a semi-pro team called the Portland All Stars.[15] 
Any hopes that Grange would lead the Bears to glory in 1926 were quickly 
dashed. A failed contract talk led to Grange bolting to the AFL's New York 
Yankees, owned by Pyle. The Bears also lost star quarterback Joey Sternaman, 
who joined the Chicago Bulls of the AFL. The Bears replaced Grange with 
Paddy Driscoll, a star football player in his own right. The Bears used 
the money made from the Grange barn-storming tour to sign the man that 
replaced him. Grange split his time between making movies and playing football. 
However, the time was not right to have two competing pro football leagues, 
and the AFL folded after only one season. Grange would return to the Bears.[15] 
After the financial losses of the 1932 Championship season, Halas' partner 
Dutch Sternaman left the organization. Halas maintained full control of 
the Bears until his death in 1983. He also coached the team off-and-on 
for forty seasons, an NFL record. In the 1932 "Unofficial" NFL Championship, 
the Bears defeated the Portsmouth Spartans in the first indoor American 
football game at Chicago Stadium. The success of the playoff game led the 
NFL to institute a championship game. In the very first NFL Championship, 
the Bears played against the New York Giants, defeating them 23–21. The 
teams met again in the 1934 NFL Championship where the Giants, wearing 
sneakers[16] defeated the Bears 30–13 on a cold, icy day at the Polo Grounds. 
From 1940–1947, quarterback Sid Luckman led the Bears to victories in four 
out of the five NFL Championship Games in which they appeared. The team 
acquired the University of Chicago's discarded nickname "Monsters of the 
Midway" and their now-famous helmet "C", as well as a newly penned theme 
song that declared them "The Pride and Joy of Illinois". One famous victory 
during that period was their 73–0 victory over the favored Washington Redskins 
at Griffith Stadium in the 1940 NFL Championship Game; the score is still 
an NFL record for lopsided results.[17] The secret behind the one-sided 
outcome was the introduction of a new offensive formation by Halas. The 
T-formation, as Halas named it, involved two running backs instead of the 
traditional one in the backfield. Luckman established himself as one of 
the franchise's most elite quarterbacks. Between 1939 and 1950, He set 
the Bears' passing records for most career touchdowns, yards, and completions. 
Many of Luckman's records stood for decades before they were eclipsed by 
Jay Cutler in 2014.[18] Cutler then went on to break Luckman's franchise 
record for most career passing touchdowns a year later in 2015.[19] After 
declining throughout the 1950s, the team rebounded in 1963 to capture its 
eighth NFL Championship, which would be its last until 1985. The late 1960s 
and early-1970s produced notable players like Dick Butkus, Gale Sayers, 
and Brian Piccolo,[20] who died of embryonal carcinoma in 1970. The American 
television network ABC aired a movie about Piccolo in 1971 entitled Brian's 
Song, starring James Caan and Billy Dee Williams in the roles of Piccolo 
and Sayers respectively; Jack Warden won an Emmy Award for his performance 
as Halas. The movie was later released for theater screenings after first 
being shown on television. Despite Hall of Fame careers, Butkus and Sayers 
would also have their careers cut short due to injuries, hamstringing the 
Bears of this era. Halas retired as coach in 1967 and spent the rest of 
his days in the front office. He became the only person to be involved 
with the NFL throughout the first 60 years of its existence. He was also 
a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's first induction class in 1963. 
As the only living founder of the NFL at the February 1970 merger between 
the NFL and the American Football League, the owners honored Halas by electing 
him the first President of the National Football Conference, a position 
that he held until his death in 1983. In his honor, the NFL named the NFC 
Championship trophy as the George Halas Memorial Trophy. After the merger, 
the Bears finished the 1970 season last place in their division, a repeat 
of their placing in the 1969 season. In 1975, the Bears drafted Walter 
Payton from Jackson State University with their first pick. He won the 
NFL Most Valuable Player Award in the 1977–78 season.[21][22] Payton would 
go on to eclipse Jim Brown's NFL career rushing record in 1984 before retiring 
in 1987, and would hold the mark until 2002, when Emmitt Smith of the Dallas 
Cowboys surpassed it.[23] Payton's career and personality would capture 
the hearts of Bear fans, who called him "Sweetness". He died from a rare 
form of liver cancer in 1999 at the age of 45. On November 1, 1983, a day 
after the death of George Halas, his oldest daughter, Virginia McCaskey, 
took over as the majority owner of the team. Her husband, Ed McCaskey, 
succeeded her father as the Chairman of the Board.[24] Their son Michael 
became the third president in team history.[25] Mrs. McCaskey holds the 
honorary title of "secretary of the board of directors", but the 90-year–old 
matriarch has been called the glue that holds the franchise together.[26] 
Mrs. McCaskey's reign as the owner of the Bears was not planned, as her 
father originally earmarked her brother, George "Mugs" Halas, Jr. as the 
heir apparent to the franchise. However, he died of a massive heart attack 
in 1979. Her impact on the team is well-noted as her own family has dubbed 
her "The First Lady of Sports", and the Chicago Sun-Times has listed her 
as one of Chicago's most powerful women.[27] Mike Ditka, a tight end for 
the Bears from 1961 to 1966, was hired to coach the team by George Halas 
in 1982. His gritty personality earned him the nickname "Iron Mike". In 
the 1985 season the fire in the Bears–Packers rivalry was relit when Ditka 
used 315 pound defensive tackle "Refrigerator" Perry as a running back 
in a touchdown play at Lambeau Field, against the Packers. The Bears won 
their ninth NFL Championship, first since the AFL-NFL merger, in Super 
Bowl XX after the 1985 season in which they dominated the NFL with their 
then-revolutionary 46 defense and a cast of characters that recorded the 
novelty rap song "The Super Bowl Shuffle". The season was notable in that 
the Bears had only one loss, the "unlucky 13th" game of the season, a Monday 
night affair in which they were defeated by the Miami Dolphins. At the 
time, much was made of the fact that the 1972 Dolphins were the only franchise 
in history to have had an undefeated season and post-season. The Dolphins 
came close to setting up a rematch in the Super Bowl, but lost to the New 
England Patriots in the AFC title game. "The Super Bowl Shuffle" was videotaped 
the day after that Monday night loss in Miami. After the 1985 Championship 
season, the Bears remained competitive throughout the 1980s but failed 
to return to the Super Bowl under Ditka. Since the firing of Ditka at the 
end of the 1992 season, the Bears have made the playoffs five times under 
three different head coaches: Dave Wannstedt from 1993 through 1998, Dick 
Jauron from 1999 through 2003, and Lovie Smith from 2004 to 2012. Before 
the Bears hired Jauron in January 1999, Dave McGinnis (Arizona's defensive 
coordinator, and a former Bears assistant under Ditka and Wannstedt) backed 
out of taking the head coaching position. The Bears scheduled a press conference 
to announce the hiring before McGinnis agreed to contract terms.[28] Soon 
after Jauron's hiring, Mrs. McCaskey fired her son Michael as president, 
replacing him with Ted Phillips and promoting Michael to chairman of the 
board.[29] Phillips, the current Bears president, became the first man 
outside of the Halas-McCaskey family to run the team.[30] Lovie Smith, 
hired on January 15, 2004, is the third post-Ditka head coach. Joining 
the Bears as a rookie head coach, Smith brought the highly successful Tampa 
2 defensive scheme with him to Chicago. Before his second season with the 
Bears, the team rehired their former offensive coordinator and then Illinois 
head coach Ron Turner to improve the Bears' struggling offense.[31] In 
2005, the Bears won their division and reached the playoffs for the first 
time in four years. Their previous playoff berth was earned by winning 
the NFC Central in 2001. The Bears improved upon their success the following 
season, by clinching their second consecutive NFC North title during Week 
13 of the 2006 season, winning their first playoff game since 1995, and 
earning a trip to Super Bowl XLI.[32] However, they fell short of the championship, 
losing 29–17 to the Indianapolis Colts. Following the 2006 season, the 
club decided to give Lovie Smith a contract extension through 2011, at 
roughly $5 million per year. This comes a season after being the lowest 
paid head coach in the National Football League.[33] The club has played 
in over a thousand games since becoming a charter member of the NFL in 
1920. Through the 2010 season, they led the NFL in overall franchise wins 
with 704 and had an overall record of 704–512–42 (going 687–494–42 during 
the regular season and 17–18 in the playoffs).[34] On November 18, 2010 
the Bears recorded franchise win number 700 in a win against the Miami 
Dolphins. The Bears made one of the biggest trades in franchise history, 
acquiring Pro Bowl quarterback Jay Cutler from the Denver Broncos in exchange 
for Kyle Orton and draft picks on April 2, 2009. After a disastrous 2009 
campaign with the team going 7–9,[35] Mike Martz was hired as the team's 
offensive coordinator on February 1, 2010.[36] On March 5, 2010, the Bears 
signed defensive end Julius Peppers, running back Chester Taylor, and tight 
end Brandon Manumaleuna, spending over $100 million on the first day of 
free agency.[37] Also during the 2010 offseason, Michael McCaskey was replaced 
by brother George McCaskey as chairman of the Bears.[38] With a 38–34 win 
against the New York Jets, the Bears clinched the No. 2 seed and a first-round 
bye for the 2010–11 NFL playoffs. In their first Playoff game since Super 
Bowl XLI, The Bears defeated the No. 3 seed Seattle Seahawks 35–24 in the 
Divisional Round. The Bears reached the NFC Championship Game, where they 
played Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field – only the second playoff meeting 
between the two storied rivals, the only other game played in 1941.[39] 
The Bears lost the game, 21–14. The team started the 2011 season strong 
with a 7–3 record, and running back Matt Forté led the NFL in total yards 
from scrimmage. Eventually, quarterback Jay Cutler fractured his thumb, 
and Forté also was lost for the season against the Kansas City Chiefs after 
spraining his MCL, and the Bears, with Caleb Hanie playing, lost five straight 
before winning against the Minnesota Vikings with Josh McCown starting 
in favor over Hanie. At season's end, general manager Jerry Angelo was 
fired, and former Chiefs director of scouting and former Bears scout Phil 
Emery was brought in. Offensive coordinator Mike Martz resigned, and eventually 
retired, and was replaced by offensive line coach Mike Tice. The Bears 
made another notable move by trading for Miami Dolphins receiver and Pro 
Bowl MVP Brandon Marshall.[40] The Bears became the first team in NFL history 
to return six interceptions for touchdowns in the first seven games of 
the season, with another pick-six by Brian Urlacher in Week 9 bringing 
Chicago two behind the record set by the 1961 San Diego Chargers.[41] However, 
the Bears missed the playoffs with a record of 10–6 (after starting the 
season 7–1, the first team to start with the record and miss the playoffs 
since the 1996 Washington Redskins),[42] and Smith was fired on December 
31.[43] Then-CFL head coach and former NFL journeyman Marc Trestman was 
hired to succeed Smith after an exhaustive search that included at least 
13 known candidates.[44][45] On March 20, 2013, Brian Urlacher's 13-year 
tenure with the Bears ended when both sides failed to agree on a contract.[46] 
The Trestman era began on September 8 with a 24–21 win over the Cincinnati 
Bengals, making Trestman the fourth head coach in Bears history to win 
in his coaching debut, after George Halas (1920), Neill Armstrong (1978) 
and Dick Jauron (1999).[47] The Bears ended the 2013 season 8–8. The following 
season was a disaster for the Bears, as they finished 5–11 and last in 
the NFC North. Trestman and Emery were fired after the season ended.[48] 
The Bears hired Ryan Pace of the New Orleans Saints to be their new general 
manager on January 8, 2015.[49] On January 16, 2015, John Fox accepted 
a four-year deal to become head coach.[50] In Fox's first season as head 
coach, the Bears saw improvements from 2014; after USA Today projected 
the Bears to win three games, they doubled that total and finished the 
season with a 6–10 record, including a Thanksgiving win over the Packers 
at Lambeau Field. Virginia Halas McCaskey, her children, and grandchildren 
control 80 percent of the team, and Mrs. McCaskey votes her children's 
stock as well as her own. Patrick Ryan, executive chairman of Aon Corp., 
and Aon director Andrew McKenna own 19.7% of the club.[51] In a Crain's 
Chicago Business article, one businessman described his wishes for the 
team to maximize its potential. In 2009, Yahoo! Sports listed the McCaskeys 
as the third worst owner in the NFL, stating "[T]hey get less for what 
they've got than any team in our league."[52] There have been rumors that 
the McCaskey family might split up over the team.[26] In 2012, Forbes magazine 
reported that the franchise is worth $1.19 billion, making it the eighth 
richest franchise in the NFL.[53] Chicago is the National Football League's 
third largest market. The team has major sponsorship deals with Chase, 
Miller Brewing Company, Cadillac, United Airlines, Motorola, Verizon, BP, 
Allstate, U.S. Cellular and Dr Pepper.[54][55][56] The team was the first 
in the NFL to have a presenting sponsor, with the 2004 season advertised 
as "Bears Football presented by BankOne (now Chase)". Additionally, the 
Bears have an agreement with WFLD (the Fox affiliate in Chicago) to broadcast 
pre-season football games.[57] The club's first logo was introduced in 
the early 1950s as a black bear on top of a football. They kept this until 
1962, when the Bears trademark 'C' logo was first introduced.[58] The change 
in their logo from the black bear was due to the addition of logos on helmets, 
which pro football teams started adding in the late 1950s and early 1960s. 
Unlike some NFL franchises that have had many different looks over time, 
the Bears have kept the wishbone 'C' for over 40 years. In 1974, the team 
decided to keep the same 'C' logo but change the color from white to orange 
with white trim. This is the current logo; however, the club has since 
introduced alternate logos, including a black bear inside of the orange 
wishbone 'C', introduced in 1995, and an orange bear head, introduced in 
1999. In 1920 the team introduced uniforms containing brown and blue stripes. 
In the 1930s, the franchise's uniform underwent substantial alterations. 
By 1933 the Bears donned all-orange jerseys with navy numbers and matching 
navy blue helmets. In 1936, they modified this design into "an early version 
of psychedelia" by adding three orange stripes to their helmets, changing 
the color of the jerseys from orange to white, complementing the new white 
jerseys with 14 navy and orange alternating stripes on the sleeves, and 
introducing socks with a similar striped pattern extending from ankle to 
knee. Because of poor response from the fans and the media, this design 
lasted only one season.[59] By 1949, the team was wearing the familiar 
navy blue shirts with white, rounded numbers. In 1956, the team added "TV 
numbers" to the sleeves. The Bears 'C' logo first appeared on the helmets 
in 1962. The logo changed from white to a white-bordered orange logo 11 
years later, and has remained unchanged ever since. The Bears added the 
initials GSH to the left sleeve of their jerseys in 1984 in memory of George 
Halas. For decades, the team was known as the only NFL team to wear jersey 
numbers that were not the traditional block-style numbers (though during 
the 1971 season, the Bears' road jerseys used the block-style numbers). 
Although a handful of other NFL teams and the Houston Oilers during their 
early AFL days experimented with rounder jersey numbers, by the mid-1960s 
the Bears were the only team left to continue wearing rounded jersey numbers. 
Since the mid-1990s, however, several teams have shifted away from the 
block numbers in favor of numbers that match a specific team font (e.g. 
Denver Broncos, Baltimore Ravens, Philadelphia Eagles, etc.) or in the 
case of the Pittsburgh Steelers, match the jersey number font with the 
helmet numbers while otherwise leaving the jersey design alone. Other variations 
to the Bears uniforms over the years include the addition of navy blue 
pants as a part of the road kit in 1984. During the 1994 season, the Bears 
– with most of the other NFL franchises – introduced throwback uniforms 
to be worn in the honor of the NFL's 75th anniversary. These uniforms with 
brown and blue stripes resemble the original Bears uniforms worn in the 
1920s. On October 7, 2002 the Bears wore navy blue pants with their navy 
blue home jerseys for the first time, and lost at home to Green Bay before 
a national Monday Night Football audience. The Bears did not wear the all-blue 
combination again until the 2006 regular season finale against the Packers, 
also a loss, on December 31. On November 13, 2005 and October 29, 2006 
(both times in games against the San Francisco 49ers), the Bears introduced 
an orange alternate home jersey. The orange swaps roles with the navy blue 
on this alternate jersey, as it becomes the dominant color while the navy 
complements. The orange jerseys were worn again on October 19, 2008 at 
home against the Minnesota Vikings in a 48–41 victory.[60] The Bears also 
wore the orange jerseys against the Detroit Lions in 2007, a 2009 game 
vs. the Cleveland Browns, as well as in 2011 against the Packers and Lions. 
The Bears previously wore orange jerseys as part of a throwback uniform 
in a Thanksgiving Day game at the Dallas Cowboys in 2004. Their uniforms, 
especially for their classic look, have been cited as one of the best in 
the league.[61] Since 2005, the Bears have worn their alternate orange 
jerseys for one home game a season that is near Halloween. For the 2005–07 
and 2010 home openers, the team wore the white jerseys with the navy blue 
pants. The team is 4–0 in these games, beating the Lions in 2005, 2006, 
and 2010, and beating the Chiefs in 2007. The Bears honored the original 
Monsters of the Midway during the 2010 season by wearing throwback uniforms 
of the era for selected games. The uniforms are a nod to the 1940s when 
the Bears won four NFL titles with Hall of Famers Danny Fortman, Sid Luckman, 
George McAfee, George Musso, Bronko Nagurski, Joe Stydahar and Clyde "Bulldog" 
Turner.[62] The Bears wore the throwbacks once again for the 2012 season.[63] 
In 2012, after Nike took over the NFL uniform supplier from Reebok, the 
Bears uniform received changes. One of the changes include moving the numbers 
on the sleeves onto the shoulder pad, as well as enlarging the GSH on the 
stripes.[64] Before the Bears had mascots, they used to have a cheerleading 
squad called the Chicago Honey Bears, which was around from 1976 to 1985. 
However, after Halas died, his daughter terminated the group after Super 
Bowl XX, calling them "sex objects" and degrading to women.[65] Before 
the introduction of Staley Da Bear, the club had two unofficial mascots 
named "Rocky" and "Bearman". "Rocky" was a man who donned a "1" Bears jersey, 
carried a megaphone, and started chants all over Soldier Field during the 
1970s, 1980s and early-1990s. There is no known source of who "Rocky" was, 
except that he disappeared from Soldier Field in the early 1990s and presumably 
lived in Northwest Indiana.[66] Don Wachter, also known as "Bearman", is 
a season ticket holder who decided in 1995 that he could also assist the 
team by cheerleading. The club allowed him to run across the field with 
a large Bears flag during player introductions and each team score. In 
1996, he donned his "costume" of face paint, bear head and arms, and a 
number 46 jersey. "Bearman" was forced to stop wearing his costume with 
the introduction of Staley Da Bear in 2003; however, in 2005 Wachter was 
allowed in costume again.[67] The Green Bay Packers are the Bears' biggest 
rivals since their team's inception in 1920. The team currently leads the 
series 94–92–6, and the teams have met twice in the postseason. The Bears 
won the 1941 meeting, 33–14, and eventually defeated the New York Giants 
in the 1941 NFL Championship Game, and the Packers won the 2011 meeting, 
21–14, en route to a Super Bowl XLV win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. The 
teams' first meeting was a victory for the Bears (known as the Staleys 
at the time) in 1921 in a shutout, 20–0. The Packers claimed their first 
win over the Bears in 1925, 14–10. The 1924 matchup (which ended in a 3–0 
win for Chicago) was notable for featuring the first ever ejection of players 
in a game in NFL history, as Frank Hanny of the Bears and Walter Voss of 
the Packers were ejected for punching each other.[68] The rivalry also 
featured one of the last successful fair catch kicks in 1968, when Bears 
kicker Mac Percival kicked the game-winning field goal.[69] Chicago and 
Minnesota took each other on in the Vikings' inaugural game, with the Vikings 
defeating the Bears in a 37–13 rout, and Minnesota currently holds the 
series lead 54–50–2. The Detroit Lions and Bears have faced off since the 
Lions' inception in 1930, when they were known as the Portsmouth Spartans, 
with the Spartans winning, 7–6, and Chicago winning the second meeting, 
14–6. Since then, the Bears have led the series, 95–66–5. The rivalry grew 
in 1932, when the Bears and Spartans met in the first ever postseason game 
in NFL history, with the Bears winning the game 9–0. The game also was 
known as the first "indoor football" game, as the game took place in indoor 
Chicago Stadium due to a blizzard at the time. The game also started the 
forward pass.[70] Former cross-town rivals, the Bears and the Cardinals 
have faced each other more times than any other teams not currently in 
the same division. Highlights of the rivalry include Ernie Nevers scoring 
40 points against the Bears in 1929 in a 40–7 rout. In 2006, the Bears 
defeated the Cardinals in a 24–23 comeback from a 20-point deficit in the 
2nd half, which resulted in Cardinals coach Dennis Green's famous rant.[71] 
The Bears currently lead the all-time series, 57–27–6. Soldier Field, located 
on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, is the current home of the Bears. The Bears 
moved to Soldier Field in 1971 after outgrowing Wrigley Field, the team's 
home for 50 years. Northwestern University's residential neighbors objected 
to their playing at Dyche Stadium, now called Ryan Field. After the AFL-NFL 
Merger, the newly merged league wanted their teams to play in stadiums 
that could hold at least 50,000 fans. Even with the portable bleachers 
that the team brought into Wrigley, the stadium could still only hold 46,000.[81] 
Soldier Field's playing turf was changed from natural grass to astroturf 
before the 1971 season, and then back to natural grass in time for the 
start of the 1988 season. The stadium was the site of the infamous Fog 
Bowl playoff game between the Bears and Philadelphia Eagles.[82] In 2002, 
the stadium was closed and rebuilt with only the exterior wall of the stadium 
being preserved. It was closed on Sunday, January 20, 2002, a day after 
the Bears lost in the playoffs. It reopened on September 27, 2003 after 
a complete rebuild (the second in the stadium's history).[81] Many fans 
refer to the rebuilt stadium as "New Soldier Field".[83] During the 2002 
season, the Bears played their home games at the University of Illinois' 
Memorial Stadium in Champaign, where they went 3–5. Many critics have negative 
views of the new stadium. They believe that its current structure has made 
it more of an eyesore than a landmark; some have dubbed it the "Mistake 
on the Lake".[84] Soldier Field was stripped of its National Historic Landmark 
designation on February 17, 2006.[85] In the 2005 season, the Bears won 
the NFC North Division and the No. 2 Seed in the NFC Playoffs, entitling 
them to play at least one home game in the postseason. The team hosted 
(and lost) their divisional round match on January 15, 2006 against the 
Carolina Panthers. This was the first playoff game at Soldier Field since 
the stadium reopened. The stadium's end zones and midfield were not painted 
until the 1982 season.[86] The design sported on the field included the 
bolded word "Chicago" in both end zones. In 1983, the end zone design returned, 
with the addition of a large wishbone "C" Bears logo painted at midfield. 
These field markings remained unchanged until the 1996 season.[87] In 1996 
the midfield wishbone "C" was changed to a large blue Bears head, and the 
end zone design were painted with "Bears" in cursive. This new design remained 
until the 1999 season, at which point the artwork was returned to the classic 
"Chicago" and the "C". In the new Soldier Field, the artwork was tweaked 
to where one end zone had the word "Chicago" bolded and the other had "Bears".[88] 
While the Super Bowl XX Champion Bears were a fixture of mainstream American 
pop culture in the 1980s, the Bears made a prior mark with the 1971 American 
TV movie Brian's Song starring Billy Dee Williams as Gale Sayers and James 
Caan as Brian Piccolo. The film told of how Piccolo helped Sayers recover 
from a devastating knee injury to return to his status as one of the league's 
best players, and how Sayers in turn helped the Piccolo family through 
Brian's fatal illness.[89][90] A 2001 remake of the movie for ABC starred 
Sean Maher as Piccolo and Mekhi Phifer as Sayers.[91] The 1985 team is 
also remembered for recording the song "The Super Bowl Shuffle", which 
reached number forty-one on the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for 
a Grammy Award.[92][93] The music video for the song depicts the team rapping 
that they are "not here to start no trouble" but instead "just here to 
do the Super Bowl Shuffle". The team took a risk by recording and releasing 
the song before the playoffs had even begun, but were able to avoid embarrassment 
by going on to win Super Bowl XX by a then-record margin of 46–10. That 
game was one of the most watched television events in history according 
to the Nielsen ratings system; the game had a rating of 48.3, ranking it 
7th in all-time television history.[94] In addition to the "Super Bowl 
Shuffle"[95] rap song, the Bears' success in the 1980s – and especially 
the personality of head coach Mike Ditka – inspired a recurring sketch 
on the American sketch comedy program Saturday Night Live, called "Bill 
Swerski's Superfans".[96] The sketch featured Cheers co-star George Wendt, 
a Chicago native, as host of a radio talk-show (similar in tone to WGN 
radio's "The Sportswriters"), with co-panelists Carl Wollarski (Robert 
Smigel), Pat Arnold (Mike Myers) and Todd O'Connor (Chris Farley). To hear 
them tell it, "Da Bears" and Coach Ditka could do no wrong. The sketch 
stopped after Ditka was fired in 1993. The sketch usually showed the panelists 
drinking lots of beer and eating lots of Polish sausage, and often featured 
Todd getting so agitated about what was happening with the Bears that he 
suffered a heart attack, but quickly recovered (through self-administered 
CPR). The sketch also features the cast predicting unrealistic blowout 
victories for Bears games.[97] Da Super Fan sketch has not been brought 
back by SNL, with the exception of a single appearance by Horatio Sanz 
as a Super Fan for the Cubs on Weekend Update in 2003. Outside of SNL, 
George Wendt reprised his role of Swerski in the opening promo of Super 
Bowl XL on ABC. On TV shows based in Chicago such as The Bob Newhart Show, 
Married... with Children, Family Matters, Still Standing, According to 
Jim, Early Edition and The Bernie Mac Show, the main characters are all 
Bears fans, and have worn Bears' jerseys and T-shirts on some occasions. 
Some episodes even show them watching Bears games. Roseanne is another 
TV show based outside of Chicago to feature the Bears as the consensus 
household favorite, as 'Dan Connor' John Goodman is seen wearing Bears 
hats in several episodes. That '70s Show featured several Bears references, 
as it was based in Wisconsin, home of the Packers. On one episode while 
the gang is at a Bears vs. Packers game, Eric comes to the seat in a Walter 
Payton jersey and is booed by the surrounding Packers fans. In an episode 
of the Disney Channel show Shake It Up, based in Chicago, recurring character 
Dina Garcia (Ainsley Bailey) sold scalped Chicago Bears tickets. More recently, 
Modern Family character Cameron Tucker has been shown as a Bears fan. In 
an episode of the Disney Channel show "I Didn't Do It", based in Chicago, 
Lindy Watson (Olivia Holt) and Logan Watson (Austin North) try to get a 
football signed by NFL Hall of Famer Dick Butkus after destroying their 
fathers Butkus signed ball, Alshon Jeffery also makes a cameo appearance 
as well. Ditka's success and popularity in Chicago has led him to land 
analyst roles on various American football pregame shows. Ditka worked 
for both the NFL on NBC and CBS's The NFL Today, and he currently works 
on ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown and provided Friday night analysis on the 
Bears on WBBM-TV's 2 on Football with former WBBM-TV sports director Mark 
Malone.[98] He is also the color analyst for all local broadcasts of Bears 
preseason games. Ditka also co-starred himself alongside actor Will Ferrell 
in the 2005 comedy film Kicking & Screaming.[99] Also, Ditka, Dick Butkus, 
Walter Payton, Jim McMahon, William "Refrigerator" Perry and Brian Urlacher 
are among Bears figures known for their appearances in TV commercials. 
Urlacher, whose jersey was among the league's best-selling in 2002, was 
featured on Nike commercials with former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael 
Vick.[100][101] In the 1961 Hanna-Barbera animated short "Rah Rah Bear", 
Yogi Bear helps the Bears beat the New York Giants.[102] The Bears were 
later depicted in an episode of the 1985 cartoon version of the NBC sitcom 
Punky Brewster, where the Bears are playing the Green Bay Packers.[103][104] 
Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) from the National Lampoon's Vacation series 
appears in some scenes wearing a navy blue with burnt orange scripting 
Chicago Bears ball cap. He wears the same Chicago Bears cap throughout 
all four Vacation movies.[105] Chicago Bears Network Currently, WBBM (780 
AM) and its simulcasting partner, WCFS-FM (105.9 FM) broadcast Bears games 
with Jeff Joniak doing the play-by-play, along with color commentator Tom 
Thayer, who played for the Bears from 1985–1992,[106] and sideline reporter 
Zach Zaidman. Over the years, many Bears play-by-play broadcasters have 
included play-by-play announcers Jack Brickhouse, Joe McConnell and Wayne 
Larrivee, and color commentators Hub Arkush, Dick Butkus, Jim Hart and 
Irv Kupcinet. Their current preseason TV announcers on WFLD (channel 32), 
which also carries the majority of the team's regular season games through 
the NFL on Fox, are Sam Rosen (play-by-play), Erik Kramer (color commentary) 
and Lou Canellis (sideline reporter). When the games are played against 
an AFC team, it can be aired on CBS affiliate WBBM-TV. Sunday Night games 
are broadcast on WMAQ-TV, the NBC O&O station. Patrick Mannelly holds the 
record for the most seasons in a Bears uniform with 16.[107] On the other 
hand, Steve McMichael holds the record for most consecutive games played 
by a Bear with 191;[107] he accomplished the feat from 1981 to 1993. In 
second place is Payton, who played 186 games from 1975 to 1987 at running 
back, a position considered to be conducive to injury, only missing one 
game in a span of 13 seasons. Kicker Robbie Gould became the Bears' all-time 
scoring leader in Week 5 of 2015 season[108] overtaking placekicker Kevin 
Butler who previously held the club record[107] for scoring the most points 
in his ten-year Bear career. He scored 1,116 points as the Bears kicker 
from 1985 to 1995. He is followed by running back Walter Payton, with 750 
points. Payton holds the team record for career rushing yards with 16,726.[107] 
That was an NFL record until Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys broke it 
in 2002. Current Bears running back Matt Forte, who started playing for 
the Bears in 2008, is the closest to Payton's record with 6,985 yards. 
Forte also holds the team's single season record for rookies in rushing 
attempts, rushing yards and receptions. Mark Bortz holds the record for 
most Bear playoff appearances, with 13 between 1983 and 1994, and is followed 
by Kevin Butler, Dennis Gentry, Dan Hampton, Jay Hilgenberg, Steve McMichael, 
Ron Rivera, Mike Singletary, and Keith Van Horne, who have each played 
in 12 playoff games. The 1940 Chicago Bears team holds the record for the 
biggest margin of victory in an NFL game (playoff or regular season) with 
a 73–0 victory over the Washington Redskins in the 1940 NFL Championship 
Game. The largest home victory for the Bears came in a 61–7 result against 
the Green Bay Packers in 1980. The largest defeat in club history was a 
52–0 loss against the Baltimore Colts in 1964. The club recorded undefeated 
regular seasons in 1934 and 1942, but (unlike the 1972 Dolphins) did not 
win the championship game in either season. In 1934, the club completed 
a 13–0 record but were defeated by the New York Giants, and in 1942 the 
club completed an 11–0 record but were defeated by the Redskins. Had the 
Bears won either championship, the club would have completed a championship 
three-peat – a feat completed only by the Packers (twice), although no 
team has done it since the AFL-NFL merger.[109] Halas holds the team record 
for coaching the most seasons with 40 and for having the most career victories 
of 324. Halas' victories record stood until Don Shula surpassed Halas in 
1993. Ditka is the closest Bears coach to Halas, with 112 career victories. 
No other Bears coach has recorded over 100 victories with the team.[107] 
During the 2006 season, return specialist Devin Hester set several kick 
return records. He currently holds the franchise record for most return 
yards with 2,261.[110] He had six touchdown returns, setting a record for 
most returns in a single season.[111] In 2007, he recorded another six 
touchdown season from returns. One of the most notable of these returns 
came on November 12, 2006, when he returned a missed field goal for a 108-yard 
touchdown.[112] The record tied former teammate Nathan Vasher's previous 
record, which was set almost a year earlier.[113] Additionally, Hester 
set a Super Bowl record by becoming the first player to return an opening 
kick of a Super Bowl for a touchdown.[114] On December 20, 2010, Hester 
set an NFL record for most touchdowns on a punt or kickoff return with 
his 14th career return coming against the Minnesota Vikings. In 2011, Hester 
broke the record for the most punt returns against the Carolina Panthers. 
In 2012, Charles Tillman has the record for most forced fumbles in a single 
game with 4 against the Tennessee Titans. Also against the Titans, Chicago 
became the first team in league history to score a touchdown pass, a touchdown 
run, an interception return for a touchdown, and a blocked kick/punt for 
a score in the same quarter.[115] Tillman and teammate Lance Briggs became 
the first pair in NFL history to return an interception for a touchdown 
in consecutive games against the Jacksonville Jaguars and Dallas Cowboys.[116]

had five Hall of Famers spend a minor portion of their career with the 
franchise.[121] Founder, owner, head coach, and player George Halas, halfback 
Bronko Nagurski, and Red Grange were a part of the original class of inductees 
in 1963. The franchise saw 14 individuals inducted into the Hall of Fame 
from 1963–1967. Defensive end Richard Dent, a member of the Super Bowl 
XX team is the most recent Bear inducted, a part of the Class of 2011. 
The Bears have retired 14 uniform numbers, which is the most in the NFL, 
and ranks fourth behind the basketball Boston Celtics (21), baseball New 
York Yankees (20), and hockey Montreal Canadiens (15) for the most in North 
American professional sports. The Bears retired Mike Ditka's number 89 
jersey on December 9, 2013.[122] It is the last number that the Bears retired.[123]
