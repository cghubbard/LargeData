Edward Michael "Ed" Montague (born November 3, 1948) is a former umpire 
in Major League Baseball. He worked in the National League in 1974 and 
from 1976 to 1999, and officiated throughout both leagues between 2000 
and 2009. The most senior active umpire in the major leagues at the time 
of his retirement, he wore uniform number 11 throughout his career. His 
4,369 total games ranked eighth in major league history when he retired, 
and he is one of only three umpires to serve as crew chief for the World 
Series four times. His father, also named Ed Montague, was a major league 
player and scout. Montague was born in San Francisco, California. He officiated 
in the World Series in 1986, 1991, 1997, 2000, 2004 and 2007, serving as 
crew chief on the last four occasions; only Bill Klem (9 times) and Bill 
Summers (4 times) held the position of World Series crew chief as often. 
Montague also umpired in the All-Star Game in 1982, 1990, 1998 and 2004, 
calling balls and strikes for the last three contests. He is only the fourth 
umpire in history - joining Bill McGowan, Summers and Al Barlick - to serve 
as crew chief for three World Series and as home plate umpire for three 
All-Star Games. In 2004 he became the first umpire to work behind the plate 
for the entire All-Star Game and serve as crew chief in the World Series 
in the same season. Montague has also umpired in seven League Championship 
Series (1979, 1987, 1992, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2002), and in seven Division 
Series (1981, 1995, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007). He was the first base 
umpire for the single-game playoff to decide the NL's 2007 wild card team. 
He became an NL crew chief in 1996 after the death of longtime umpire John 
McSherry on Opening Day at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati. On May 28, 
2006, Montague was umpiring second base when Barry Bonds hit his 715th 
home run to pass Babe Ruth for second place on the all-time list. In early 
2008, Montague ejected Los Angeles Dodgers third-base coach Larry Bowa 
after Bowa refused to heed Montague's warnings not to move in front of 
the coach's box toward the playing field. Bowa was suspended three games 
for "inappropriate and aggressive conduct."[1] Montague called the situation, 
"One of the dumbest ejections I've ever had."[2] He was known for his quick 
flick of the wrist on a called strike, and his quick punchout on called 
third strikes to left-handed hitters. Montague umpired few games during 
the 2009 season due to injury, and he announced his retirement in February 
2010. His son, also named Ed, plays for the Fort Worth Cats and his son,
