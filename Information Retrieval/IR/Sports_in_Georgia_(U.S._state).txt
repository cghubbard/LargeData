the Thrashers were sold to True North Sports and Entertainment. It was 
announced the team would move to the MTS Centre in Winnipeg and return 
the Winnipeg Jets name to the NHL, resurrecting the name of the city's 
previous NHL team that departed for Phoenix in 1996. The Thrashers played 
their home games at the Philips Arena in Atlanta. The Thrashers did not 
appear in the Stanley Cup Finals. They only won one division title during 
the 2006-07 NHL season and were swept in the first round by the New York 
Rangers. Currently, the ECHL has only one operating team in Georgia. The

subsequently relocated to Macon, Georgia after going dormant for two seasons. 
The Atlanta Silverbacks were a North American Soccer League team founded

was an American soccer team that was founded in 2005. The team was a member

Georgia. The Atlanta Beat was an American professional soccer club based

University Soccer Stadium, the result of a public-private partnership between 
the team and Kennesaw State University. The club succeeded the former Atlanta 
Beat of the defunct Women's United Soccer Association. The Beat folded

2014. Atlanta United FC is expected to begin play in the league in 2017.

tracks in Georgia are the Atlanta Motor Speedway, Road Atlanta (where the 
Petit Le Mans is held), Atlanta Dragway, Dixie Speedway and Roebling Road 
Raceway.[18] One of the most famous racers to come from Georgia is Bill 
Elliott.[19] Many observers consider Dawsonville one of the birthplaces 
of NASCAR because so many individuals involved in the sport were from that 
city. Notable racers from Dawsonville include, Bill Elliott, Roy Hall and 
Lloyd Seay.[20] Since 1951 Georgia tracks have hosted two to eight races 
in NASCAR's elite division.[20] Dawsonville is home to the Georgia Racing
