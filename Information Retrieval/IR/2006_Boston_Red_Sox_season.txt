The Boston Red Sox' 2006 season was a season in American baseball. It included 
the Boston Red Sox attempting to win the American League East division. 
The Red Sox finished the season in third place in the AL East and missed 
the playoffs. The Boston Red Sox finished 11 games behind the first place 
team in the American League East, the New York Yankees. While part of the 
blame for the Red Sox demise could be the 5 game sweep at the hands of 
the New York Yankees from August 18 â€“ 21, the team had a poor record the 
entire month of August (going just 9-21) and September (13-14). Also, they 
suffered extensive injuries to Jason Varitek, Manny Ramirez, Jonathan Papelbon, 
Jon Lester, and Keith Foulke. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]
