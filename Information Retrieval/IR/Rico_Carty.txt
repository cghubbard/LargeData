Ricardo Adolfo Jacobo Carty (born September 1, 1939) is a Dominican former 
professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as an 
outfielder in a career that spanned from 1963 to 1979.[1] Nicknamed "Beeg 
Boy", he was the 1970 National League (NL) batting champion with a .366 
average and made his only All-Star appearance that season.[1] A charismatic, 
gifted hitter, Carty was one of the earliest Dominicans to play in MLB. 
However, his career was marked by battles with injuries, illnesses (he 
had Tuberculosis) and with team mates.[2] In his 15 seasons, he played 
for the Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves and Chicago Cubs of the NL, and the Oakland 
Athletics, Cleveland Indians, Toronto Blue Jays and Texas Rangers of the 
American League.[1] Carty signed a contract with the Milwaukee Braves as 
a free agent in 1959.[3] While he was an excellent hitter, he had poor 
defensive skills.[4] Originally a catcher, Carty was converted into an 
outfielder in order to lessen his defensive liabilities and to get his 
bat into the everday lineup.[4] After four years in the minor leagues, 
Carty made an impressive major league debut in 1964, finishing second to 
Roberto Clemente in the National League Batting Championship with a .330 
batting average and, finishing the season as runner-up to Dick Allen in 
the 1964 National League Rookie of the Year Award ballot.[5][6] He continued 
to hit over .300 for the next three seasons but, then faltered in 1967, 
slumping to a .255 batting average in part due to a separated shoulder.[4] 
Carty then missed the entire 1968 season while battling with tuberculosis.[4] 
He recovered in 1969 with a .342 batting average, helping the Braves win 
the National League Western Division title, the franchise's first post-season 
berth since the 1958 World Series, and finishing 13th in the National League 
Most Valuable Player Award voting.[1][7][8] The Braves would eventually 
lose to the "Miracle" Mets in the 1969 National League Championship Series.[9] 
Carty had his best season in 1970 when he hit 25 home runs with 101 runs 
batted in and, won the National League Batting Championship with a .366 
batting average, the highest average in the major leagues since Ted Williams 
recorded a .388 batting average in 1957.[10] Despite not appearing on the 
All-Star ballot, he was voted to be a starting outfielder for the National 
League as a write-in candidate in the 1970 All-Star Game, playing alongside 
Hank Aaron and Willie Mays in the outfield.[11][12] It would be the only 
All-Star appearance of his career. Carty also compiled a 31-game hitting 
streak in 1970 (the longest by a Brave in the franchise's Atlanta history 
until Dan Uggla surpassed it with a 33-game streak in 2011). He was named 
NL Player of the Month in May with a .448 batting average, 7 homeruns, 
and 22 RBI, and finished 10th in the 1970 National League Most Valuable 
Player Award voting.[4][13] A crushed knee injury suffered during the Dominican 
Winter Baseball season meant that Carty would miss another entire season 
in 1971.[2] He returned in 1972, but only managed a .277 batting average. 
By then, Carty had worn out his welcome with the Braves management as well 
as his teammates, having been involved in fights with Hank Aaron and Ron 
Reed.[2] In October 1972, he was traded to the Texas Rangers to fill the 
role of the newly adopted designated hitter.[3] Carty had difficulty adjusting 
to the hitting-only position, hitting for only a .232 average before being 
traded in mid-season to the Chicago Cubs.[14] While with the Cubs, he had 
a personality clash with their star third baseman, Ron Santo, forcing the 
team to trade Carty to the Oakland Athletics one month later.[3][14] With 
a combined .229 batting average for the three teams, Carty was released 
by the Athletics in December 1973 and, it seemed as if his career might 
be over.[1] In 1974 he signed to play with Córdoba in the Mexican Baseball 
League.[15] In August 1974, the Cleveland Indians signed him to be their 
designated hitter.[15] Carty's career was rejuvenated with Cleveland, posting 
a .308 batting average with 64 runs batted in during the 1975 season and, 
improving to a .310 batting average with 83 runs batted in for the 1976 
season.[1] In 1977, his batting average dropped to .280 however, he still 
produced 80 runs batted in.[1] In March 1978 the Indians traded Carty to 
the Toronto Blue Jays.[3] The Blue Jays then traded him to the Oakland 
Athletics in August of that year.[3] At the age of 38, he hit for a combined 
.282 batting average with 31 home runs and 99 runs batted in.[1] After 
being granted free agency in November 1978, he signed a contract to play 
for the Blue Jays before retiring at the end of 1979 at the age of 39.[1] 
In a fifteen-year major league career, Carty played in 1,651 games, accumulating 
1,677 hits in 5,606 at bats for a .299 career batting average along with 
204 home runs, 890 runs batted in and a .369 on-base percentage.[1] He 
ended his career with a .974 fielding percentage.[1] During his career, 
he played as a catcher, first baseman, third baseman, outfielder and designated 
hitter. One of the early major leaguers out of the baseball-rich Dominican 
Republic, Carty was committed to helping the developing nation. In the 
1964–65 off-season, as the country reeled between rapid governmental transitions 
and militarism, he undertook a trip with Catholic Relief Services to his 
home country, on a mission to deliver clothing and supplies.[16] In 1996 
he gained induction into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame as part of
