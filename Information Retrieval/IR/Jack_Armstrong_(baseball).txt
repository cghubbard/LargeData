Jack William Armstrong (born March 7, 1965) is a former Major League Baseball 
right-handed pitcher. He is a graduate of Neptune High School in Neptune 
Township, New Jersey, where he once struck out 22 batters in a nine-inning 
game,[1] and an alumnus of Rider College and the University of Oklahoma.[2] 
His son, Jack Armstrong Jr., turned down a one-million dollar signing bonus 
from the Texas Rangers out of high school in order to play college baseball 
for the Vanderbilt Commodores, and currently is pitching in the Cape Cod 
Baseball League for the Wareham Gatemen. Erik, his younger son, currently 
plays baseball at the University of South Carolina Beaufort, a team that 
went to the NAIA World Series in 2012. Drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in 
the 1st round of the 1987 MLB amateur draft, Armstrong made his big-league 
debut on June 21, 1988, and appeared in his final game on April 17, 1994. 
A torn rotator cuff helped end his career at the age of 27. Armstrong was 
also a member of the inaugural Florida Marlins team in 1993. Armstrong 
had the best year of his career with the Cincinnati Reds in 1990. He won 
eight of his first nine starts and was the National League's starting pitcher 
in the All-Star Game. He tailed off, however, ending the year with a record 
of 12–9 and a 3.42 ERA. He relieved Scott Scudder in Game 2 of the 1990 
World Series with the Reds trailing, 4–3. Armstrong pitched three scoreless 
innings against the Oakland Athletics, and the Reds won the game in the 
10th inning. After his career 1990 season, he spent one more year with 
the Reds, then spent one season each with the Indians, Marlins, and Rangers
