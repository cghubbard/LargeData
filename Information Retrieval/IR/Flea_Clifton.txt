Herman Earl "Flea" Clifton (December 12, 1909 – December 22, 1997), was 
a professional baseball player for 13 years from 1930 to 1943. He played 
parts of four season in Major League Baseball as an infielder for the Detroit 
Tigers from 1934 to 1937. He was a member of the 1935 Detroit Tigers team 
and was the starting third baseman in the 1935 World Series. Clifton also 
played 12 years of minor league baseball, including stints with Raleigh 
Capitals (1930–1931), Beaumont Exporters (1932–1933), Toledo Mud Hens (1936–1937), 
Toronto Maple Leafs (1938–1941), Oklahoma City Indians (1941–1942), Fort 
Worth Cats (1942), and Minneapolis Millers (1943). After retiring from 
baseball in 1944, Clifton worked in the insurance business in Cincinnati, 
Ohio, for 40 years.[citation needed] Clifton was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, 
in 1909.[1] He grew up in the west end of Cincinnati.[2] His father was 
killed in the Argonne Forest in 1918 while serving in World War I. In 1925, 
his mother was strangled, using Clifton's school tie, by a friend of his 
stepfather. Clifton became a homeless orphan at age 15: "Right after my 
mom died my stepdad kicked my ass out into the snow. He never liked me, 
anyway. Rightfully so. That was 1925. I'll never forget that year. For 
a year it was tough, but I toughened up pretty quick. I was living behind 
a garage in the back end of town, across the Ohio River in Ludlow, Kentucky."[2] 
Eventually, his grandmother found him and "dragged" him to her house where 
he lived.[3] Clifton played semi-pro baseball in Cincinnati on a team that 
won the city championship. The team advanced to the National Amateur Baseball 
Federation tournament, and Clifton was voted the outstanding shortstop 
in the tournament.[4] He was discovered by Detroit scout Billy Doyle and 
signed with the Detroit Tigers. Clifton idolized Ty Cobb as a boy (Clifton 
referred to Cobb as his "patron saint") and signed with Detroit even though 
the St. Louis Cardinals were willing to pay more money.[4] Clifton began 
his professional baseball career playing in the Detroit farm system for 
the Raleigh Capitals of the Class C Piedmont League. He played for Raleigh 
in 1930 and 1931. In 1930, he hit .261 with nine triples and two home runs. 
In 1931, he improved his batting average to .301.[5] Clifton met future 
Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg when they played together in Raleigh. Greenberg 
and Clifton were the only two teammates from Raleigh to make it to the 
major leagues with the Tigers. The two remained friends and teammates through 
the remainder of Clifton's career. Clifton appeared in the 1998 documentary 
about Greenberg, "The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg." In his autobiography, 
Greenberg recalled Clifton as a "tough little guy even though he weighed 
only about 150 pounds."[6] Greenberg wrote that, while playing together 
in Raleigh, Clifton used a gray bat made of Cuban wood that he soaked in 
water every night, supposedly "to keep it from cracking or chipping." Greenberg 
recalled: "Flea guarded that bat with his life; he'd fight anybody who 
came near it."[6] Greenberg also joked about Clifton's unusual diet: "On 
the road, he used to eat nothing but dougnuts and bananas. He said they 
were cheap and filling and stretched his meal money. Flea was the only 
ballplayer who could show a profit on $1-a-day meal money."[6] In 1932 
and 1933, Clifton played for the Beaumont Exporters in the Class A Texas 
League. The 1932 Beaumont team, managed by Del Baker, won the Texas League 
championship and included several future Tigers, including Clifton, Hank 
Greenberg, Schoolboy Rowe, Pete Fox, Elden Auker and Frank Reiber. Each 
of these players would play together on Detroit's 1934-1935 Detroit pennant 
teams.[7] Clifton later recalled that he frequently got into "fracases" 
with other players and ended up being hit by pitches more than anyone else. 
When Clifton claimed not to understand why he got hit so much, a teammate 
told him: "Then repeat after me: 'I give the pitcher hell, I give the catcher 
hell, I give the infielders hell, so their control's not so good when you 
come to the plate.'"[8] While playing in Beaumont, manager Del Baker gave 
him the nickname "Flea." Clifton's son recounted: "He kept pestering the 
manager until the guy said, 'Herman, you're worse than a damn sand flea,' 
and the 'flea' stuck."[9] Clifton enjoyed the wild atmosphere in the Texas 
League. He later wrote: "Texas is my favorite state, for a number of reasons. 
The beer tastes better and the women are prettier. And I love the heat. 
. . . Thexas would've adopted me, I'm telling you right now. I would've 
been a good ol' Texan. Fact of the matter is, the owner of the Beaumont 
team wanted to adopt me."[8] In 1933, Clifton had his best season in professional 
baseball. He raised his batting average to .301 with 25 doubles, 11 triples, 
and 2 home runs in 575 at bats.[5] He also drew 93 walks and stole 49 bases. 
Defensively, Clifton became one of the best shortstops in the Texas League, 
compiling 417 putouts, 433 assists and a .966 fielding percentage.[10] 
After a strong season in Beaumont, Clifton was the subject of a front-page 
profile in The Sporting News in December 1933. The article noted that he 
had been Beaumont's starting second baseman in 1933 and a shortstop in 
1932. It concluded that Clifton was "not expected to cause the retirement 
of Charlie Gehringer to the shade of the bench, but there is a strong possibility 
that he will stay around because of his qualifications as a utility man."[10] 
Clifton attended spring training with the Tigers in 1934 as the No. 1 rookie 
in the camp. With Gehringer entrenched at second base, the Tigers sought 
to convert Clifton to third base as a possible replacement for Marv Owen. 
Team owner Frank Navin, not typically verbose in his praise for rookies, 
stated that he appreciated Clifton's effort and viewed him as an "old-fashioned 
player."[11] Clifton made the Tigers' roster in 1934, but was unable to 
find a spot in the starting lineup. With Charlie Gehringer, Billy Rogell 
and Marv Owen appearing in all 154 games at second, short and third, there 
was little room for Clifton even to make an appearance as a backup.[12] 
He appeared in only 20 games for the 1934 Tigers, none as a starter, and 
went 1-for-16 for an .063 batting average.[1] The Tigers won the 1934 American 
League pennant, but Clifton saw no action in the 1934 World Series. With 
the Tigers' veteran infield returning, the 1935 season began for Clifton 
much like the 1934 season. Gehringer and Rogell appeared in 150 games, 
but Owen missed 19 games at third. Clifton filled in for Owen, starting 
19 games at third base and also starting four games at second and two at 
shortstop. Clifton appeared in a total of 45 games for the 1935 Tigers 
and improved his batting average to .255 with nine RBIs.[1] In the 1935 
World Series, Clifton started the series on the bench. However, Hank Greenberg 
broke his wrist in Game 2, and Marv Owen was moved from third base to first 
base to fill in for Greenberg. With Owen vacating third, Clifton stepped 
in as the starting third baseman for the remainder of the Series. Clifton 
was hitless in 16 at bats in the Series,[1] and later recalled: "I never 
hit the ball harder than I did in the '35 Series, but I couldn't buy a 
base hit." [13] Though he was unable to hit, Clifton walked twice, scored 
a key run and contributed defensively to the 1935 World Series championship. 
In Game 4, Clifton scored the winning run to put the Tigers ahead, 3 games 
to 1. With two out in the sixth inning, Clifton hit a long, high line fly 
to deep left field. Chicago's Augie Galan misplayed the ball, and Clifton 
wound up on second base. Pitcher Alvin Crowder then came to bat and hit 
an "easy roller" through the infield, and Clifton scored standing up from 
second base.[14] Clifton also made a significant contribution to the Tigers' 
decisive Game 6 victory. With the Cubs ahead, 3-2, Stan Hack hit a double 
in the 6th inning. When Hack tried to score from second base later in the 
inning, Clifton positioned himself in the base path as Hack attempted to 
round third base. Hack was called out when he tried to run around Clifton. 
Hack protested that he had not left the base path, but the call was upheld. 
The Tigers scored twice after Hack was called out and won the game, 4-3.[15] 
Clifton saw limited action with the Tigers in 1936 and 1937. In 1936, he 
appeared in only 13 games for the Tigers and compiled a .192 batting average.[1] 
He spent some of the season with the Tigers' farm team, appearing 19 gams 
for the Toledo Mud Hens.[5] In 1937, Clifton was left with the Mud Hens 
for most of the season. He appeared in 107 games in Toledo and compiled 
a .253 batting average 18 doubles, 3 triples, and 4 home runs.[5] When 
Charlie Gehringer pulled a ligament during the 1937, Clifton was recalled 
to the Tigers to play second base.[16] He appeared in 15 games for the 
1937 Tigers, managing only five hits in 43 at bats for a .114 batting average.[1] 
Clifton appeared in his last major league game on July 1, 1937.[1] With 
Gehringer healthy, the Tigers sent Clifton back to Toledo subject to recall 
on 24-hour notice.[17] In January 1938, the Tigers gave Clifton an outright 
release, selling him to the Toronto Maple Leafs.[18] Veteran Detroit sports 
writer Sam Greene paid tribute to Clifton upon his final, unconditional 
release by the Tigers. Greene wrote: "The definite departure of the versatile 
Clifton will be accepted with a measure of regret by those who appreciate 
hustling abilities in an athlete. Clifton has no superior in aggressive 
spirit. To him a ball game, regardless of the state of the score, was always 
worthy of his best efforts."[16] Greene concluded that, despite Clifton's 
zest for the game, he could not overcome the simple physical reality that 
he was too "undersized and frail" to compete in the major leagues.[16] 
After leaving the Tigers, Clifton played eight more years in the minor 
leagues. He played for the Toronto Maple Leafs in the International League 
from 1938 to 1941, the Oklahoma City Indians in the Texas League from 1941 
to 1942, and the Fort Worth Cats in the Texas League in 1942.[5] Clifton 
concluded his professional baseball career in 1943, playing 150 games for 
the Minneapolis Millers in the American Association. Clifton compiled a 
.282 batting average and 56 RBIs for the 1943 Millers.[5] Clifton retired 
from baseball when an offer to make him manager in Minneapolis was revoked: 
"I had a really good year. They were going to make me manager, but then 
they gave it to Zeke Bonura, who was coming out of the service. I said 
the hell with it. I had three kids and I didn't like to travel. I started 
in the insurance business, another career."[13] Clifton was married to 
his wife, Marcella, in 1931. Their children included son, Kerry, and daughters, 
Arlene, Carol and Gwenn.[9] After retiring from baseball in 1944, Clifton 
returned to his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio. He became an insurance agent 
and worked for 40 years at the George R. Hammerlein Insurance agency, eventually 
holding the title of vice president.[9] Clifton also served for many years 
as a sandlot baseball coach in the Greater Cincinnati Knothole Association, 
where his Bridgetown and Harrison teams "won several city and national 
championships."[9] His son, Kerry Clifton, recalled his father's days as 
a coach: "When you played for him, he'd tell you he'd promise you three 
things: a little sweat, a little blood and victory . . . He'd take everybody's 
castoffs and mold them into championship teams."[9] Clifton died of complications 
from a stroke in 1997 at Franciscan Hospital-Western Hills Hospital in 
Cincinnati.[9] He was buried at the Bridgetown Cemetery in Hamilton County,
