Wilmer Alejandro Flores Garcia (born August 6, 1991) is a Venezuelan professional 
baseball infielder for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He plays all four infield positions for the Mets. Flores signed as an international 
free agent out of Venezuela with the Mets on August 6, 2007, his 16th birthday.[1][2] 
He was rated in the Top 100 prospects by Baseball America prior to the 
2009 (#47), 2010 (#88) and 2011 (#59) seasons. Flores started at second 
base for the World team at the 2009 All-Star Futures Game. He also has 
been named to the Baseball America Rookie All-Star Team (2008), the APP 
Post-Season All-Star Team (2008), the MiLB.com Organization All-Star Team 
(2010) and the South Atlantic League All-Star Team (2010). In 2011, the 
Mets sent Flores back to the St. Lucie Mets of the Class A-Advanced Florida 
State League (FSL) to convert him from a shortstop into a third baseman. 
In 2012 Flores was selected at third base for the FSL All-Star Game. He 
went 3-for-4 with a run scored and three runs batted in, earning Most Valuable 
Player honors.[3] He also appeared in the All-Star Futures Game for the 
second time in his career. The Mets promoted Flores to the Binghamton Mets 
of the Class AA Eastern League during the 2012 season.[4] He finished the 
2012 season with Binghamton batting .311 in 66 games with 8 home runs, 
33 RBIs, and 20 walks. Flores began the 2013 season with the Las Vegas 
51s of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. He finished his 2013 season 
with the 51s batting .321 in 107 games with 15 home runs, 86 RBIs, and 
25 walks. He gained a promotion to the Mets on August 6, on the day of 
his 22nd birthday.[5] Pitcher Bobby Parnell was placed on the disabled 
list with a herniated disk in his neck to make room for Flores on the roster.[6] 
He made his debut that day against the Colorado Rockies at Citi Field going 
0-for-4 at the plate and committing an error in the sixth inning in what 
would be a 3-2 Mets win.[7] On August 7, he notched his first career major 
league hit, a single in the bottom of the second inning off Rockies pitcher 
Jhoulys Chacín. In the bottom of the eight inning he hit a bases-loaded 
clearing double off pitcher Manny Corpas for his first three major league 
RBIs. The Mets would go on to win 5-0.[8] On August 11, he hit his first 
career home run, a solo home run to right field off Arizona Diamondbacks 
pitcher Heath Bell in the top of the ninth inning to extend the Mets lead 
to 9-5 by which the Mets won.[9] He finished the 2013 season appearing 
in 27 games with a batting average of .211 in 95 at-bats in 101 plate appearances 
while compiling 20 hits, 13 RBIs, 1 home run, 5 walks, 8 runs scored and 
striking out 23 times. Flores started the 2014 season with the 51s, but 
was called up April 2 along with Kyle Farnsworth to replace Bobby Parnell 
going to the disabled list and with Daniel Murphy on paternity leave.[10] 
He would be re-sent back to the 51s on April 6 to make room for Jon Niese 
coming off the disabled list.[11] Flores had only started one game at second 
base going 0-for-4 with two strikeouts. He was recalled on May 9 with Omar 
Quintanilla being designated for assignment.[12] On June 2, Flores drove 
in a career high 6 RBIs during which he also hit his first career grand 
slam against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park. The grand 
slam came in the top of the ninth inning off pitcher Phillippe Aumont with 
two outs extending the lead 11-2 to which the Mets won to.[13] On June 
26, Flores was once again re-sent down to the 51s to make room for Juan 
Lagares coming of the disabled list.[14] He was recalled for good on July 
24 with Kirk Nieuwenhuis being sent to the 51s.[15] Flores finished the 
2014 season appearing in 78 games with a batting average of .251 in 259 
at-bats in 274 plate appearances while compiling 65 hits, 29 RBIs, 6 home 
runs, 12 walks, 28 runs scored and striking out 31 times. Flores made the 
Mets' roster for Opening Day in 2015.[16][17] During the first week of 
the season, Flores struggled offensively and defensively as he made three 
errors and batted .158 in seven games.[18] In nine games since the opening 
week, Flores batted .364 with three home runs, which was tied for second 
most among NL shortstops. He was tied with Brandon Crawford of the San 
Francisco Giants.[19] Soon thereafter, Flores was tied for third in all 
of baseball in errors committed with six while he and Daniel Murphy committed 
ten of the Mets' seventeen errors.[20] On May 13, Flores was seventh among 
National League shortstop leaders in Wins Above Replacement.[21] On May 
16, Flores became the first National League position player to hit a grand 
slam batting ninth in a National League ballpark.[22] The home run came 
off Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Matt Garza with one out on a 1-1 pitch count 
with the score 2-0 extending it to 6-0 in the bottom of the fourth inning 
at Citi Field. The home run was his sixth of the season and his second 
career grand slam.[23][24] On May 26, Flores at the time was tied for most 
home runs hit by a shortstop with Jhonny Peralta of the St. Louis Cardinals 
with seven.[25] That same day, Flores hit his first career walk-off, a 
single, off Phillies' pitcher Elvis Araújo in the bottom of the tenth inning 
with two outs scoring Juan Larges for his second RBI of the game.[26] On 
July 29, rumors spread during the Padres-Mets game that Flores had been 
traded to the Milwaukee Brewers along with pitcher Zack Wheeler for Carlos 
Gómez.[27] Despite the rumors, Flores remained in the game, and was visibly 
emotional when he returned to the field and the fans began giving him a 
standing ovation. However, following the game, General Manager Sandy Alderson 
told the media that no trade had occurred, and that "social media got ahead 
of the facts." It was later reported that the trade deal had fallen through.[28] 
Mets' manager Terry Collins said that he knew nothing about the potential 
trade and told Flores "Listen, I don't know what's going on, but you've 
got a game to play, let's play baseball."[29] It was later reported that 
the Mets backed out of the trade after a concern about Gómez's physical 
as a medical report showed an issue with his hip.[30] Two days later on 
July 31, Flores hit his first career walk-off home run, a solo home run, 
off Washington Nationals pitcher Felipe Rivero in the bottom of the 12th 
inning on a 1-1 count with no outs, winning the game for the Mets by a 
score of 2-1. Flores had also driven in the other Mets run earlier in the 
game. Flores during each at-bat received a standing ovation from the Mets' 
fans. The win brought the Mets within two games of first place in the NL 
East.[31][32] Since the incident, Flores has become a fan-favorite of Mets 
fans and was given standing ovations in the subsequent weeks, both at home 
and at away games. It was also the only walk-off home run the Mets hit 
during the 2015 season.[33] At this point on August 25, since the failed 
trade, he hit .343 with a .993 OPS and four home runs. The Mets have gone 
16-6 since that day.[34] Flores finished the 2015 season appearing in 137 
games with a batting average of .263 in 483 at-bats in 510 plate appearances 
while compiling 127 hits, 16 home runs, 59 RBIs, 55 runs scored, 19 walks, 
and striking out 63 times. In the NLDS against the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
he hit .300 in four games while compiling 3 hits, 1 double, 2 walks, 2 
runs scored and striking out 4 times. He then batted .286 in four games 
while compiling 4 hits, 1 double and 1 triple, 1 walk, 1 stolen base and 
striking out 2 times against the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS. Flores was the 
last out of the World Series, striking out looking in game five against 
Kansas City Royals closer Wade Davis to clinch the series for the Royals. 
Flores appeared in all five games batting .059 with 1 hit, 2 runs scored, 
2 walks and 3 strikeouts. In December, Flores suffered a broken left ankle 
after being hit by a pitch in winter ball in Venezuela.[35] On May 12, 
Flores was put on the on the 15-day disabled list with a left hamstring 
injury with his spot on the roster being replaced by Sean Gilmartin. Flores 
was batting .180 with one home run and two RBIs in 50 at-bats this season 
playing at first, second and third base filling in as a defensive replacement 
for Lucas Duda, Neil Walker and David Wright respectively.[36] Flores was 
activated from the DL on May 29 with Matt Reynolds being sent down to make 
room for him on the roster.[37] In five rehab games with the Binghamton 
Mets, Flores had batted .235 with one RBI and four hits. In a July 3 game 
at Citi Field against the Chicago Cubs, Flores became the only Mets player 
to collect six hits in a game other than fellow Venezuelan infielder Edgardo 
Alfonzo in August 1999. In doing so, he raised his batting average 31 points 
from .224 to .255.[38] He became the first player in Major League Baseball 
to accomplish the feat since C.J. Cron the day earlier and the first player 
in the National League to do so since Charlie Blackmon on April 4, 2014.[39] 
On September 10, Flores injured his wrist in a collision at home plate 
with Atlanta Braves catcher A.J. Pierzynski. On September 30, the Mets 
announced that Flores would miss the rest of the year, including the postseason.[40] 
On October 7, Flores underwent surgery to have part of the hamate bone
