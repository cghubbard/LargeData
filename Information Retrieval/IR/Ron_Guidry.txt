Ronald Ames Guidry (/ˈɡɪdri/; born August 28, 1950), nicknamed "Louisiana 
Lightning" and "Gator", is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) left-handed 
pitcher. He played his entire 14-year baseball career for the New York 
Yankees of the American League (AL), from 1975 through 1988. Guidry was 
also the pitching coach of the Yankees from 2006 to 2007. Guidry won the 
AL Cy Young Award in 1978 as the best pitcher in the AL. He also won five 
Gold Glove Awards, given for superior fielding, and appeared in four All-Star 
games. Guidry served as captain of the Yankees from 1986 through 1988, 
and his number has been retired by the Yankees. Guidry was born in Lafayette, 
Louisiana where he pitched for the University of Southwestern Louisiana 
(now University of Louisiana at Lafayette.) He began his career pitching 
briefly in the 1975 and 1976 seasons after 4 years in the minors.[1] In 
1977, he began as a relief pitcher but was moved into the starting rotation. 
He helped lead the New York Yankees to a World Series championship in 1977[2] 
and 1978.[3] In those two years combined, Guidry went 4-0 in the postseason 
with 3 complete games in 5 starts, allowing only nine earned runs in 37 
1⁄3 innings pitched.[4] In 1978, Guidry posted a career year, one of the 
best in the modern era. Against the California Angels on June 17, he struck 
out a Yankee-record 18 batters.[5] Guidry's 18-strikeout performance is 
usually cited as the launching pad of the Yankee Stadium tradition of fans 
standing and clapping for a strikeout with two strikes on the opposing 
batter. For the season, Guidry went 25-3,[4] in a season that is among 
the top 10 for winning percentage in baseball history. He led the league 
with a sparkling 1.74 ERA, 25 wins, a .893 winning percentage, 9 shutouts, 
248 strikeouts, and 6.15 hits allowed per 9 innings pitched.[4] He held 
batters to a .193 batting average, .249 on-base percentage, and .279 slugging 
percentage. He was particularly effective with 2 outs and runners in scoring 
position (.152/.221/.253), and in the 9th inning of games (.119/.200/.136). 
Guidry's success during 1978 was due in large part to mastering the slider. 
He began throwing the pitch the year before, and was able to use the sharp-breaking 
slider to complement his great fastball throughout the season. He claimed 
the American League Cy Young Award.[4] Guidry also finished second in American 
League Most Valuable Player voting to Boston Red Sox slugger Jim Rice. 
Guidry's 25th win of the regular season was his most significant, as he 
was the winning pitcher in the Yankees' 5-4 win over the Boston Red Sox 
in a one-game playoff at Fenway Park in Boston to decide the American League 
East division winner. The game is best known for Bucky Dent's seventh-inning, 
three-run home run off Mike Torrez (who, as a Yankee pitching mate of Guidry's 
just the year before, had recorded the final putout of the 1977 World Series) 
that gave the Yankees a 3-2 lead.[6] In the second inning of that game, 
Guidry himself had given up a home run to Carl Yastrzemski—the only home 
run a left-hander would hit against him all season.[6] Later that month, 
the Yankees again won the World Series over the Los Angeles Dodgers.[4] 
No American League pitcher posted an earned run average as low again until 
Boston's Pedro Martínez in 2000. Coincidentally, in all three of Guidry's 
losses in 1978, the winning pitcher on the opposing team threw left-handed 
and had the first name "Mike." He lost 6-0 to the Milwaukee Brewers and 
left-hander Mike Caldwell on July 7, lost 2-1 to the Baltimore Orioles 
and left-hander Mike Flanagan on August 4, and lost 8-1 to the Toronto 
Blue Jays and left-hander Mike Willis on September 20. Over the next seven 
seasons, Guidry amassed a 113-57 win-loss record. Guidry also won the Gold 
Glove Award five straight times (1982–86). He also played two games in 
center field but never made a play.[7] Arm problems that began in 1981 
finally began dramatically affecting his performance. He retired from baseball 
on July 12, 1989, after shoulder surgery did not improve his performance. 
As well as winning the 1978 Cy Young Award, Guidry was named The Sporting 
News AL Pitcher and Major League Player of the Year.[4] Guidry was named 
"Lefthanded Pitcher" on The Sporting News AL All-Star Teams in 1978, 1981, 
1983 and 1985. Guidry also finished in the top 10 in the American League 
Cy Young voting six times (1977–79, 1981, 1983 and 1985) over a nine-year 
span. On August 7, 1984, Guidry struck out three batters (Carlton Fisk, 
Tom Paciorek and Greg Luzinski) on nine pitches in the ninth inning of 
a 7-0 win over the Chicago White Sox. Guidry became the eighth American 
League pitcher and the 20th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish 
the so-called "immaculate inning."[8] He was the first pitcher to do so 
in the 9th inning of a complete game, a feat which has since been matched 
only once. Guidry served as co-captain of the Yankees along with Willie 
Randolph from March 4, 1986 until July 12, 1989. Guidry was also noted 
for having a very good pickoff move. His number 49 was retired on "Ron 
Guidry Day", August 23, 2003. The Yankees also dedicated a plaque to hang 
in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. The plaque calls Guidry "A dominating 
pitcher and a respected leader" and "A true Yankee." Each living Yankee 
previously so honored was on hand for the ceremony: Phil Rizzuto, Yogi 
Berra, Whitey Ford, Reggie Jackson and Don Mattingly.[9] Guidry joined 
Yankee's Manager Joe Torre's coaching staff as pitching coach in the 2006 
season, replacing Mel Stottlemyre.[10] Under Guidry's tenure, the Yankees' 
pitching staff enjoyed mixed results. The pitching staff's ERA decreased 
from 4.52 in 2005 to 4.41 in 2006 under his first year of coaching, though 
in 2007, the team ERA increased to 4.49 (or 17th overall in the Major leagues). 
However, Guidry was criticized in 2007, because the highly acclaimed pitching 
staff was underachieving.[11] The Yankees pitching staff in 2007 walked 
the sixth most batters overall in the Major Leagues; this was the most 
walks in a season for a Yankees pitching staff since the 2000 season. Torre's 
departure from the Yankees following the 2007 season ended Guidry's tenure 
as pitching coach. Though he was interested in returning to the Yankees 
for the 2008 season, he was not offered a position on new manager Joe Girardi's 
coaching staff.[12] He did return to the Yankees as a spring training instructor.[13] 
Former New York Times writer Harvey Araton wrote a book called "Driving 
Mr. Yogi: Yogi Berra, Ron Guidry, and Baseball's Greatest Gift" that profiles 
the friendship Guidry has with Yankees' Hall of Fame catcher (and Guidry's 
former coach and manager) Yogi Berra.[14] During Spring training, Guidry
