Kelly Andrew Johnson (born February 22, 1982) is an American professional 
baseball utility player who is a free agent. He has played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, Arizona Diamondbacks, Toronto Blue 
Jays, Tampa Bay Rays, New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles 
and New York Mets. While primarily a second baseman and left fielder, Johnson 
has appeared at every position except for pitcher, catcher, and center 
field during his career. Johnson is one of a handful of players to have 
appeared in a game for all five AL East teams. He was on the New York Mets' 
postseason roster in 2015, where he appeared in his first World Series. 
Johnson was drafted in the first round (38th overall) of the 2000 Major 
League Baseball draft by the Atlanta Braves. Johnson decided to forego 
a scholarship offer to play college baseball at Texas A&M in favor of signing 
with the Braves.[1] Johnson made his Major League debut with the Braves 
on May 29, 2005 and became a regular outfielder, due to the many injuries 
that plagued the Braves early in the 2005 season. Johnson was named the 
National League Player of the Week for the week of June 13 after batting 
.417 with three home runs and 11 RBIs in 24 at-bats.[2] An elbow injury 
sidelined Johnson for the entire 2006 season. He was placed on the disabled 
list during spring training after experiencing pain while making throws 
from the outfield, and had Tommy John surgery performed by Dr. James Andrews 
on June 1.[3] During the offseason, Johnson spent many hours with Braves 
first base coach Glenn Hubbard at Turner Field to learn how to play second 
base effectively. Johnson earned the starting position at second base and 
as the leadoff hitter for the Braves for the 2007 season. On April 8, 2007, 
Johnson hit the first leadoff homer of his career in a 3-2 win against 
the New York Mets.[4] In late June, Johnson lost his position as the leadoff 
hitter in the Braves lineup. In the 48 games Johnson played in May and 
June, his on-base percentage was .325, well below the acceptable rate for 
a good leadoff hitter. Willie Harris, who took over the role as primary 
leadoff hitter, had an on-base percentage of .440 prior to June 22 (Johnson's 
last game as the leadoff hitter), prompting Braves manager Bobby Cox to 
make the change.[5] (As of August 10, Johnson had an on-base percentage 
of .419 since June 22.) In addition to being demoted from the top of the 
order, Johnson's offensive struggles motivated Cox to move Johnson into 
a platoon at second base with Yunel Escobar.[6] He capped off his year 
with 16 homers and a .276 batting average. With Escobar taking over full-time 
at shortstop, Johnson began the year as the Braves second baseman for the 
2008 season.[citation needed] Johnson had the longest hitting streak in 
the National League of the 2008 season, hitting in 22-straight games. He 
hit .398 with 19 RBIs in 25 games in September.[7] Johnson ended the 2008 
season with a .287 batting average, 12 homers, 69 RBIs, 86 runs, and 11 
stolen bases. In 2009, Johnson lost his full-time starting position with 
the Braves. He increased his contact rate on pitches inside the strike 
zone, as well as swinging at more pitches outside the strike zone. This 
pattern is associated with a less-aggressive swing and was associated with 
his poor results in 2009.[8] On December 12, 2009, Johnson, was non-tendered 
by the Atlanta Braves making him a free agent.[9] On December 30, 2009, 
Johnson signed a one-year, $2.35 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[10][11] 
Arizona had previously shown interest in acquiring Johnson from the Braves.[10] 
Johnson said this about his new team, [Phoenix is] just a place I've always 
liked, it's one of the top for me. Just with the team, we've got guys all 
over the field that are young, athletic, tons of talent. It's one of the 
places that you come in and you did not want to face the guys that were 
on the mound. He received the Player of the Month award for the month of 
April, his first month as a player for the Diamondbacks. He earned the 
award by hitting nine home runs and a .750 slugging percentage. In his 
first 22 games, Johnson batted .313 (25-80) with 18 RBI, 17 runs scored 
and a .404 OBP.[12] On July 23, 2010 Johnson successfully hit for the cycle 
against the San Francisco Giants. Johnson hit a solo home run in the first, 
a ground-rule double in the fifth, a two-run triple in the sixth and completed 
it with a single in the eighth. Johnson tied the game at 1 with his home 
run, almost tied the game with a double but it was a ground rule so Young 
was held at third base, tied the game at 3 with a 2-run triple, and represented 
the tying run with his single. On May 21, 2011, Johnson launched a pitch 
from Minnesota Twins closer Matt Capps deep into the right-field bleachers 
at Chase Field for a grand slam that capped the Diamondbacks rally from 
down 6-3 and made the score 9-6, which would be the final score. On July 
8, 2011, Johnson hit his second grand slam in the season off St. Louis 
Cardinals pitcher Kyle Lohse. Johnson gave the D-backs the lead in the 
seventh to break a tie 7-3. He hit a 2-2 pitch into the Cardinals bullpen 
while thinking that he only hit a sacrifice fly. The ball carried long 
enough to be a grand slam. On August 23, 2011, Johnson was traded to the 
Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for second baseman Aaron Hill and shortstop 
John McDonald.[13] Johnson was set to debut for the Blue Jays on August 
24, but had to return to Arizona because he forgot his passport.[14] He 
made his debut instead on August 25, and went 1 for 2 with 2 walks and 
a run scored. Johnson hit his 100th career home run on May 16, 2012.[15] 
In January 2013, the Rays agreed to a one-year contract worth $2.45 million 
with Johnson. The contract became official on February 5, 2013.[16] Johnson 
was the Rays Opening Day designated hitter, and throughout the year, he 
played there, left field, second base, third base, and 3 games at first 
base. Johnson got 50 starts in left field (the most on the team), splitting 
time with Matt Joyce and Sean Rodriguez. When he didn't start in left field, 
he would either come in off the bench, or get a start as a backup at one 
of the other positions. In 91 at-bats in May, he hit .330 with 7 HR and 
26 RBI, and he hit .333 with 4 HR and 9 RBI in July, his only two above-average 
months. In 118 games in 2013, he hit .235 with 16 HR and 52 RBI. He experienced 
a severe drop in walks (27 less than 2012) and strikeouts (60 less than 
2012), but he also played in 24 fewer games. In December 2013, Johnson 
signed a one-year contract with the New York Yankees worth $3 million.[17][18] 
In late July, Johnson suffered a groin injury that placed him on the 15-day 
DL.[19] Johnson was mostly used as a reserve corner infielder with the 
Yankees, making 56 starts at the two positions. In 77 games with New York, 
he hit .219/.304/.373 with 6 HR and 22 RBI. The Yankees traded Johnson 
to the Boston Red Sox for Stephen Drew on July 31, 2014 which was the first 
trade between the rival teams since 1997.[20][21][22] This trade also reunited 
Johnson with Blue Jays manager John Farrell. Johnson played in just 10 
games with the Red Sox, hitting 4-25 (.160) with a double and 1 RBI. The 
Red Sox traded Johnson to the Baltimore Orioles, along with Michael Almanzar, 
for Ivan De Jesus Jr. and Jemile Weeks on August 30, 2014.[23] He is the 
first player to play for every AL East team since MLB switched to six divisions 
in 1994.[24] On January 21, 2015, Johnson signed a minor league contract 
with the Atlanta Braves. The deal included an invitation to spring training.[25][26] 
On April 4, the team announced that Johnson had made the Opening Day roster.[27] 
Through his first 28 games with the Braves, Johnson spent most of his playing 
time at third base and left field. On May 14, 2015, in a game against the 
Cincinnati Reds, an oblique injury forced Johnson to leave the game after 
just two pitches in his first and only at bat. He had led the team in home 
runs at the time with six. He was placed on the DL and remained there until 
June 10, 2015. After everyday first baseman Freddie Freeman suffered a 
wrist injury, Johnson often split time at first base with Chris Johnson 
and Joey Terdoslavich, in addition to playing left field and occasionally 
at third base. On July 24, 2015, the Braves traded Johnson and third baseman 
Juan Uribe, along with cash considerations, to the New York Mets for minor-league 
pitchers John Gant and Rob Whalen. In his first game as a Met, he hit a 
single, a double, and a home run in a 15â€“2 victory against the Los Angeles 
Dodgers.[28] With the Mets, Johnson made his first major-league appearance 
at shortstop. On January 8, 2016, Johnson again returned to the Braves, 
signing a one-year deal worth $2 million.[29] On June 8, 2016, the Braves 
traded Johnson to the Mets for minor league pitcher Akeel Morris.[30] Johnson 
is married to Lauren, with whom he has three children, Cole, Grant and
