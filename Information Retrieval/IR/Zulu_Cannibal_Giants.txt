The Zulu Cannibal Giants were an African American baseball team (they referred 
to themselves as a Baseball "Zulu Tribe", based on a concept inspired by 
the war in Ethiopia) formed in 1934 by Charlie Henry in Louisville, Kentucky. 
The Zulu Cannibal Giants gained notoriety for their propensity to turn 
a baseball game into a comedy performance, much in the same way that the 
Harlem Globetrotters did with basketball many years later. The Zulu Cannibal 
Giants decorated their faces and bodies with African tribal paint, went 
shirtless, wore only grass skirts, used special custom-made baseball bats 
crafted to supposedly resemble Ethiopian war clubs, and always played barefoot. 
Although the team was extremely popular with the public, some black athletes 
disapproved of the Cannibals because of the stereotype.[1] At some point 
in their career they were managed by New York City promoter Syd Pollock, 
who also managed a similar novelty team called the Indianapolis Clowns 
(also known as the Cincinnati Clowns, and the Ethiopian Clowns).[1] Popularly 
regarded as a Negro league team, they technically were not accepted members
