Thaddis Bosley Jr. (born September 17, 1956) is a former Major League Baseball 
outfielder for the California Angels (1977, 1988), Chicago White Sox (1978-1980), 
Milwaukee Brewers (1981), Seattle Mariners (1982), Chicago Cubs (1983-1986), 
Kansas City Royals (1987-1988) and Texas Rangers (1989-1990). Bosley was 
called up to the Angels after hitting .326 in 69 games for the Salt Lake 
City Gulls of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), and made his Major League 
debut on June 29, 1977. Bosley was traded in the off-season to the Chicago 
White Sox with Richard Dotson and Bobby Bonds. He remained with the White 
Sox organization for three years and later played for the Milwaukee Brewers, 
Seattle Mariners, and Chicago Cubs, distinguishing himself as one of the 
best pinch hitters in the majors.[1] During the 1985 season, Bosley hit 
.328 and was voted the best pinch hitter in baseball. After being traded 
to the Kansas City Royals in 1987, Bosley returned again to the California 
Angels in 1988. In 1989, he signed with the Texas Rangers and ended his 
playing career on June 1, 1990. He appeared with two division champions, 
the 1981 Brewers and the 1984 Cubs. Both teams lost their respective League 
Championship Series, however, so Bosley never played in a World Series. 
Bosley played fourteen major-league seasons, appearing in 784 games with 
1,581 at-bats, a .272 batting average and twenty home runs. Bosley was 
a coach for the Oakland Athletics[2] from 1999-2002. During the 2008-2009 
seasons Bosley served as an assistant coach and then as the head coach 
for the baseball team at the now defunct Bethany University in Scotts Valley, 
California. Bosley was announced on June 24, 2009 as the head coach at 
Southwestern College in Phoenix, Arizona. After one season at Southwestern, 
Bosley accepted the hitting coach vacancy for the most recent American 
League champion, the Texas Rangers on November 23, 2010.[2] He was fired 
as the Rangers hitting coach on June 8, 2011. Bosley was briefly a member 
of a funk group called Ballplayers which featured former Major League Baseball 
journeyman Lenny Randle. Some of their music can be heard on a compilation 
called "Family Album", which was released in 2010 on the DC-based music
