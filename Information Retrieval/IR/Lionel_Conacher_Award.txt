The Lionel Conacher Award is an annual award given to Canada's male athlete 
of the year. The sports writers of the Canadian Press (CP) first conducted 
a poll to determine the nation's top athlete, of either gender, in 1932. 
Separate polls for the best male and female athletes were conducted beginning 
the following year. The CP formalized the poll into an award in 1978, presenting 
their winner with a plaque. It was named after Lionel Conacher, a multi-sport 
champion whom the news organization had named its top athlete of the half-century 
in 1950.[1] The award is separate from the Lou Marsh Trophy, in which a 
select panel of sports writers vote for their top overall athlete. The 
poll was suspended for four years during the Second World War after the 
CP decided it could not name a sporting "hero" at a time when Canadian 
soldiers were fighting in Europe.[2] Football player Joe Krol became the 
first repeat winner following the war, earning top spot in both 1946 and 
1947.[3] Hockey star Maurice Richard was the first three-time winner in 
1958, and baseball pitcher Ferguson Jenkins the first four-time winner 
in 1974.[4] Hockey Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky has won the most Lionel 
Conacher Awards, finishing top of the poll six times in the 1980s, and 
in 1999 was named the Canadian Press Athlete of the Century.[5] The most 
recent winner was hockey player Carey Price, named the victor after winning 
four NHL awards (Hart Memorial Trophy, Ted Lindsay Trophy, Vezina Trophy 
and Jennings Trophy) and leading the NHL in both goals against average 
and saves percentage. The winner was originally selected following a straight 
vote of each writer's top choice. Golfer Ross Somerville won the inaugural 
poll after becoming the first Canadian to win the United States Amateur 
Championship.[6] By 1936, the poll was conducted via a points system where 
each writer ranked their top three choices. Their first choice received 
three points, second choice two, and third choice one point.[7] This points 
system has remained since. In 2001 golfer Mike Weir defeated hockey player 
Joe Sakic by two points in one of the closest votes in the award's history. 
He did so despite earning 13 fewer first place votes than Sakic.[8] Historically, 
the poll has not been limited to Canadians. Foreign-born athletes who were 
outstanding performers in Canadian sport have also gained consideration. 
Football player Fritz Hanson, a native of Minnesota, was named top athlete 
in 1939,[9] while American Don Jones finished fourth in voting in 1971 
on the strength of his performances with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the 
Canadian Football League.[10] The poll became increasingly dominated by 
professional athletes since the 1960s â€“ only three amateurs won the award 
between 1965 and 1984.[11] Winners have represented a broad spectrum of 
sports. Individual sport winners include weightlifter Doug Hepburn in 1953,[12] 
figure skater Kurt Browning in 1990 and 1991,[13] and most recently, gymnast 
Kyle Shewfelt in 2004.[14] Participants in one of North America's "major 
league" team sports won each year between 2005 and 2010. National Hockey 
League player Sidney Crosby and National Basketball Association player 
Steve Nash have each won three times overall and Major League Baseball 
player Justin Morneau won in 2008.[15] Overall, hockey players have finished 
at the top of the annual polls the most times at 26. Track and field is 
second with 13 winners and football third with 10. a Denotes athlete also 
won the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canadian athlete of the year.[79] b According 
to the Canadian Press, the award was discontinued between 1942 and 1945 
because "sports writers decided athletes cannot rate as heroes while young 
Canadian pilots, paratroopers and corvette gunners fought for freedom in 
the shadow of death".[2] c No winner was announced for the years 1950 or 
1999 as the Canadian Press instead voted for athlete of the half-century
