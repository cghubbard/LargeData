The following is a detailed history of the Kansas City Royals, a Major 
League Baseball team that began play in 1969 in Kansas City, Missouri. 
The team is currently in the American League Central Division. The franchise 
has won one wild card berth, seven division titles, four league championships, 
and two World Series titles. When the Kansas City Athletics moved to Oakland 
after the 1967 season, Kansas City was left without major league baseball 
or, for the first time since 1883, professional baseball at all. An enraged 
Senator Stuart Symington threatened to introduce legislation removing baseball's 
antitrust exemption unless Kansas City was granted a team in the next round 
of expansion.[1] Major League Baseball complied with a hasty round of expansion 
at the 1967 winter meetings. Kansas City was awarded one of four teams 
to begin play in 1971. However, Symington was not satisfied with having 
Kansas City wait three years for baseball to return, and pressured MLB 
to allow the new teams to start play in 1969. Symington's intervention 
may have contributed to the financial collapse of the Royals' companion 
expansion team, the Seattle Pilots, who had to begin play in 1969 before 
they were ready (the league required new franchises to enter in pairs to 
preserve symmetry for scheduling purposes). Pharmaceutical executive Ewing 
Kauffman won the bidding for the new Kansas City team, which he named the 
Royals after the American Royal, a livestock show, horse show, and rodeo 
held annually in Kansas City since 1899.[2] (Some sources say it was in 
honor of the Kansas City Monarchs, a Negro League team.)[3] The team's 
logo, a crown atop a shield with the letters "KC" inside the shield, was 
created by Shannon Manning, an artist at Hallmark Cards, based in Kansas 
City.[4] The Royals began operations with General Manager Cedric Tallis, 
who soon developed a reputation as the best trader in the league. The first 
big trade was with fellow expansion team Seattle, which brought in 1969 
Rookie of the Year Lou Piniella. In their inaugural game, on April 8, 1969, 
the Royals defeated the Minnesota Twins 4-3 in 12 innings. Two pitching 
stars from the Baltimore Orioles team that won the 1966 World Series pitched 
for the Royals in the inaugural game: Wally Bunker threw the franchise's 
very first pitch, and Moe Drabowsky won the game in relief. After finishing 
the season in 5th place, the Royals' next trade cemented a reputation as 
a speedy team. Third baseman Joe Foy was traded to the New York Mets for 
speedy outfielder Amos Otis, who would become the Royals' first star. Further 
one-sided trades brought to the Royals second baseman Cookie Rojas, bullpen 
ace Ted Abernathy, shortstop Fred Patek, first baseman John Mayberry and 
left fielder Hal McRae. The Royals also invested in a strong farm system 
and in the early years developed such future stars as pitchers Paul Splittorff 
and Steve Busby, infielders George Brett and Frank White, and outfielder 
Al Cowens. In 1971, the Royals had their first winning season, with manager 
Bob Lemon guiding them to a second-place finish. In 1973, under Jack McKeon, 
the Royals adopted their iconic "powder blue" road uniforms and moved from 
Municipal Stadium to the brand-new Royals Stadium (now known as Kauffman 
Stadium). The stadium had deep outfield walls and artificial turf, and 
gave future young stars the opportunity to build a playing style involving 
aggressive baserunning and good defense. The stadium was built alongside 
the National Football League's Kansas City Chiefs' new home, Arrowhead 
Stadium—both complete the Truman Sports Complex. Unlike many of the new 
stadiums going up at the time, Kansas City chose dedicated stadiums for 
their sports teams over one multi-purpose stadium. Manager Whitey Herzog 
replaced McKeon in 1975, and the Royals began their ascension to the top 
of the American League West. They finished 1975 with a 91-71 record, second 
to the Oakland Athletics. That season, John Mayberry finished second to 
Boston's Fred Lynn in the MVP voting. The 1976 season brought secured dominance 
to the Royals. First, George Brett defeated his own teammate Hal McRae 
to win the batting title on the season's final day. Second, the Royals 
won the first of three straight Western Division championships. They lost 
to the New York Yankees in three straight American League Championship 
Series encounters, despite winning more regular season games in two of 
those years. In two of those years, they lost the AL Championship Series 
in the ninth inning of the fifth and final game. However, the three playoffs 
series helped George Brett become a superstar, as he homered three times 
in a losing effort in the final game of the 1978 playoff series. In addition 
to a nucleus of Brett, White, McRae,and Cowens, these Royals teams featured 
pitchers Dennis Leonard and Larry Gura, closer Dan Quisenberry, and position 
players Willie Wilson, U.L. Washington and Darrell Porter. The 1977 season, 
however, ended on another sour note as Herzog demanded that John Mayberry 
be traded or he would threaten to leave the team. This resulted in Mayberry 
being traded to the Toronto Blue Jays. After the Royals finished in second 
place in 1979, Herzog was fired and replaced by Jim Frey. Most believe 
that the firing was due to Herzog's strained relationship with the Royals 
front office including General Manager Joe Burke, owner Ewing Kauffman, 
and Kauffman's wife, Muriel.[citation needed] Under Frey, the Royals rebounded 
in 1980 and advanced to the ALCS, where they again faced the Yankees. The 
team was led by Brett, who flirted with a .400 batting average and won 
the AL MVP, and Willie Wilson, who electrified crowds with stolen bases 
and inside-the-park home runs. In the 1980 ALCS, the Royals finally vanquished 
the Yankees in a three-game sweep punctuated by a George Brett home run 
off Yankees' star closer Goose Gossage. Frank White was named the playoffs 
MVP for all-around steady play and heroics. However, after reaching their 
first World Series, the Royals fell to the Philadelphia Phillies in six 
games. The Phillies featured future Hall of Famers Mike Schmidt and Steve 
Carlton, as well as all-time hits leader Pete Rose. In the series, Willie 
Aikens became the first player in World Series history to homer twice in 
two separate Series games. The Royals returned to the post-season in 1981, 
losing to the Oakland Athletics in a unique divisional series resulting 
from the split-season caused by the 1981 Major League Baseball strike. 
In 1983, the Royals were headed for a second-place finish behind the Chicago 
White Sox when they were rocked by scandals. The first event added another 
chapter to the team's heated rivalry with the Yankees. In a July game between 
the two teams, third baseman George Brett hit a go-ahead home run in the 
top of the ninth inning. After Brett crossed home plate and returned to 
the dugout, Yankees manager Billy Martin complained that Brett had more 
pine tar on his bat than baseball's rules allowed. After inspecting the 
bat, the umpires disallowed the home run and called Brett out, ending the 
game. The signature image from the event was Brett storming angrily out 
of the dugout to argue the call. The second scandal of the 1983 season 
was far more serious, involving a truly illegal substance and several Royals 
players. Leadoff hitter and center fielder Willie Wilson, power-hitting 
first baseman Willie Aikens, power-hitting outfielder Jerry Martin, and 
starting pitcher Vida Blue, who had been released on August 5, were charged 
with attempting to purchase cocaine. The four were charged in October 1983, 
pleaded guilty, spent three months in prison, and were suspended by commissioner 
Bowie Kuhn for the entire 1984 season. The four appealed and were permitted 
to return on May 15. In response to the scandal, owner Ewing Kauffman founded 
the Ewing Marion Kauffman foundation to give back to the community, allowed 
Martin to depart via free agency, and traded Aikens, retaining only Wilson's 
services. The 1983 season was also notable for some transitional changes 
in the Royals organization. First, owner Ewing Kauffman sold 49% of his 
interest to Memphis developer Avron Fogelman. Second, John Schuerholz was 
named general manager. Schuerholz soon bolstered the farm system with pitchers 
Bud Black, Danny Jackson, Mark Gubicza, David Cone, and Bret Saberhagen, 
as well as hitters such as Kevin Seitzer. Under the leadership of manager 
Dick Howser, the Royals – relying on Brett's bat and the young pitching 
of Saberhagen, Gubicza, Bud Black, Danny Jackson, and Charlie Leibrandt 
– won the franchise's fifth division championship in 1984, although they 
were swept by the eventual World Series champion Detroit Tigers in the 
American League Championship Series. In the 1985 regular season the Royals 
topped the Western Division for the sixth time in ten years, led by Bret 
Saberhagan's Cy Young Award-winning performance. In the last week of the 
season, Brett put on an amazing hitting streak that led the Royals climb 
from behind to overtake the California Angels in the standings. Throughout 
the ensuing playoffs, the Royals repeatedly put themselves into difficult 
positions, but improbably managed to escape each time. With the Royals 
down two games to zero in the American League Championship Series against 
the Toronto Blue Jays, George Brett put on a hitting show in game three, 
homering in his first two at bats and then doubling to the same right field 
location in his third at-bat. After falling behind 3-1 in the series, the 
Royals eventually rallied to win the series 4-3 (notably, the LCS had been 
expanded to a best-of-seven format for the first time in 1985, which allowed 
the Royals to survive at all). Brett was named ALCS MVP. In the 1985 World 
Series against the cross-state St. Louis Cardinals – the so-called "I-70 
Series" because the two teams are both located in the state of Missouri 
and connected by Interstate 70 – the Royals again fell behind 3-1. The 
key game in the Royals' comeback was Game Six. Facing elimination, the 
Royals trailed 1-0 in the bottom of the ninth inning, before rallying to 
score two runs and win. The rally was helped by a controversial call at 
first base by umpire Don Denkinger, which allowed Royals outfielder Jorge 
Orta to reach base safely as the first baserunner of the inning. Following 
Orta's single, the Cardinals seemingly lost their concentration, dropping 
an easy popout and suffering a passed ball, before the Royals won with 
a bloop base hit by seldom used pinch hitter Dane Iorg, a former utility 
player for the Cardinals. Following the tension and frustration of Game 
Six, the Cardinals came undone in Game Seven, and the Royals won 11-0 to 
clinch the franchise's first World Series title. In 1986, the Royals fell 
suddenly from contender status. They also made one of the worst trades 
in franchise history, trading native Kansas Citian and future perennial 
All-Star David Cone for Ed Hearn. Hearn played for less than a month in 
Kansas City. The Royals were the trendy pre-season pick to return to the 
World Series in 1987, but the season proved bittersweet for the Royals. 
The team won 83 out of 162 games (a seven win improvement from 1986), and 
wound up finishing two games behind the eventual World Champion Minnesota 
Twins in the Western Division. Further, on June 17, 1987, Dick Howser died 
after a year-long battle with brain cancer. Howser's #10 soon became the 
first number that the Royals retired. Also in 1987, the team released longtime 
star Hal McRae and selected John Wathan as its new manager in midseason 
after firing Billy Gardner. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Royals 
developed young stars such as Bo Jackson, Tom Gordon, and Kevin Seitzer, 
made some successful free-agent acquisitions, and generally posted winning 
records, but always fell short of the post-season. For example, in 1989, 
the Royals won 92 games and posted the third-best record in baseball, but 
did not qualify for the playoffs, finishing second in their division behind 
the eventual World Series champion Oakland Athletics. They also traded 
their star pitchers for questionable talent: Charlie Leibrandt for Gerald 
Perry, Bud Black for Pat Tabler, Danny Jackson for Kurt Stillwell, and 
Bret Saberhagen for Kevin McReynolds, Gregg Jefferies and Keith Miller. 
At the end of the 1989 season, the team boasted a powerhouse pitching rotation, 
including the AL Cy Young Award-winner Bret Saberhagen (who set franchise 
record 23 wins that year), two-time All-Star Mark Gubicza (a 15-game winner 
in 1989) and 1989 AL Rookie of the Year runner-up Tom Gordon (who won 17 
games that year).[5] But the organization felt it was still missing a few 
necessary pieces to give its divisional rival Oakland Athletics a run for 
their money.[6] For one thing, the Royals had been without a high-caliber 
closing pitcher since All-Star Dan Quisenberry was dropped in 1988. So 
prior to the 1990 season, the Royals acquired Mark Davis, the 1989 National 
League Cy Young Award-winner and league leader in saves, signing him to 
a four-year $13 million contract (the largest annual salary in baseball 
history at the time).[7] The Royals also signed starting pitcher starting 
pitcher Storm Davis, who was coming off a career-high 19-game win season 
(third-best in the AL), to a three-year $6 million contract.[7] Finally, 
the team also added pitcher Richard Dotson and traded for 1988 All-Star 
first baseman Gerald Perry. Kansas City's milestone off-season in 1989–1990 
was its biggest commitment to free agents in the club's entire history.[5] 
Despite the promising off-season moves, the team suffered critical bullpen 
injuries while both newly signed Davises experienced lackluster seasons 
in 1990.[6] The Royals concluded the season with a 75–86 record, in second-to-last 
place in the AL West (and with the worst franchise record since 1970). 
To make matters worse Bo Jackson – the team's potential future franchise 
player – suffered a devastating hip injury while playing football in the 
off-season, so the Royals waived him during spring training in 1991.[8] 
Many of the team's highlights from this era instead centered on the end 
of Brett's career, such as his third and final batting title in 1990 – 
which made him the first player to win batting titles in three different 
decades – and his 3,000th hit. Though the team dropped out of contention 
from 1990 to 1992, through the strike-shortened 1994 season, the Royals 
still could generally be counted on to post winning records. The 1994 season 
was the club's last flirtation with greatness for two decades. Led by manager 
Hal McRae and Cy Young Award-winner David Cone (whom owner Ewing Kaufmann 
had re-signed), the Royals had a fourteen-game winning streak just before 
the season ended prematurely due to the players' strike. At the start of 
the 1990s, the Royals had been hit with a double-whammy when General Manager 
John Schuerholz departed in 1990 and team owner Ewing Kauffman died in 
1993. Kauffman's death left the franchise without permanent ownership until 
Wal-Mart executive David Glass purchased the team for $96 million in 2000. 
Partly because of the resulting lack of leadership, after the 1994 season 
the Royals decided to reduce payroll by trading pitcher David Cone (again) 
and outfielder Brian McRae, then continued their salary dump in the 1995 
season. In fact, the team payroll, which was always among the league's 
highest, was sliced from $40.5 million in 1994 (fourth-highest in the major 
leagues) to $18.5 million in 1996 (second-lowest in the major leagues).[9][10] 
In 1997, the Royals franchise had the opportunity to switch to the National 
League and play in the NL Central alongside its intrastate rival St. Louis 
Cardinals.[11] The opportunity arose because Major League Baseball was 
planning to realign the divisions in preparation for expansion with the 
Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Bud Selig, baseball's acting 
commissioner and Milwaukee Brewers owner, gave the Royals the first option 
to change to the National League. That summer, the Royals were mired in 
the team's worst season since its second year of existence. Further, following 
Ewing Kauffman death, the franchise was being run by a board of directors 
and was up for sale. Ultimately, the board declined the move, and Milwaukee 
switched leagues instead.[11] Some commentators have argued that the Royals 
should have made the move. According to their logic, if the Royals had 
changed leagues, the team would have played the Cardinals more often and 
would have been in the same division with the Chicago Cubs; these teams 
might have drawn bigger crowds to Kauffman Stadium.[11] Further, with no 
designated hitter in the National League, there would have been one less 
big salary to pay,[11] which would have been easier for the Royals' front 
office to manage. Opinion at the time was fairly split. The Royals polled 
their fans, and reported that a slight majority of the 1,500 who returned 
surveys approved a move to the NL. Many fans, including former Royal Greg 
Pryor, thought that switching leagues was the only way to keep the Royals 
in Kansas City.[11] On the other hand, there was also a strong sentiment 
among some fans that Kansas City was, is, and always would be an American 
League market. Back then, the glory years weren’t that far removed, and 
the emotional tie to the rivalry with the Yankees, for instance, was still 
burning.[11] There was nothing in Kauffman's will or known feelings about 
how he would have received a move to the National League.[11] As the decade 
drew to a close, attendance at Royals games slid while the average MLB 
salary continued to rise, and the Royals found it difficult to retain their 
remaining stars. The team decided to trade players such as Kevin Appier, 
Johnny Damon and Jermaine Dye for prospects rather than pay higher salaries 
or lose them to free agency. By 1999, the Royals' payroll had fallen again 
to $16.5 million.[9] Making matters worse, most of the younger players 
that the Royals received in exchange for these All-Stars proved of little 
value, setting the stage for an extended downward spiral. In 1999, the 
Royals set a franchise low with a .398 winning percentage (64-97 record), 
and lost 97 games again in 2001. The records could have been even worse 
without the rapid development of center fielder Carlos Beltrán (Rookie 
of the Year in 1999) and first baseman Mike Sweeney. In 2002, the Royals 
set a new team record for futility, losing 100 games for the first time 
in franchise history. The team also introduced new black and dark blue 
jerseys for alternate games, and also sleeveless home jerseys.[12] The 
jerseys were met with mixed reactions in Kansas City, and eventually, by 
the 2006 season, the Royals again changed their uniforms back to their 
"old" style.[13] The 2003 season saw a temporary end to the losing, when 
manager Tony Peña, in his first full season with the club, guided the team 
to its first winning record (83–79) since 1994 and finished in third place 
in the AL Central. He was named the American League Manager of the Year 
for his efforts, and shortstop Ángel Berroa was named AL Rookie of the 
Year. From the 2004 season through the 2012 season, the Royals posted nine 
consecutive losing records – the longest streak in team history. In six 
of those seasons the team finished in last place in the American League 
Central, and in eight of those nine seasons the team also lost at least 
90 games. The worst seasons came in 2004–2006, when the Royals lost at 
least 100 games each year and set the franchise's all-time record for losses 
(56–106 in 2005). Picked by many to win their division in 2004 after faring 
surprisingly well in the free agent market, the Royals got off to a disappointing 
start and by late June again were in rebuilding mode, releasing veteran 
reliever Curtis Leskanic before financial incentives kicked in and trading 
veteran reliever Jason Grimsley and superstar center fielder Carlos Beltrán 
for prospects, all within a week of each other. The team subsequently fell 
apart completely, establishing a new low by losing 104 games. Worse yet, 
the younger players received in these trades again did little to immediately 
restock the team or its farm system, although Mark Teahen, acquired in 
the Beltrán trade, would blossom in 2006 (following a brief demotion to 
the minor leagues). In 2005, the Royals continued their youth movement, 
with the second-lowest payroll in the Major Leagues.[10] Six of the team's 
starting position players, three of the five starting pitchers, and the 
setup man and closer were all under the age of 30. After posting a miserable 
8-25 record to start the season, Tony Peña resigned as manager on May 10; 
Buddy Bell was hired to replace him three weeks later. During that season, 
the Royals suffered a franchise record 19-game losing streak highlighted 
by a three-game stretch of blowout losses at home from August 6 through 
August 9; in that stretch the Royals lost 16-1 to the Oakland Athletics 
in the first game, were shut out 11-0 by Oakland in the second game, and 
then in the third game, against the Cleveland Indians, built a 7-2 lead 
in the ninth inning before allowing 11 runs to lose 13-7. The Royals finally 
ended their losing streak at 19 on August 20, two losses short of the American 
League record, with a 2-1 win over the Oakland Athletics. The Royals ended 
the 2005 season with a 56-106 record (.346), a full 43 games out of first 
place. It was the third time in four seasons that the team reestablished 
the mark for worst record in the history of the franchise. The team finished 
the season tenth in the American League in hitting (.263 AVG), twelfth 
in runs scored (702) and last in pitching (5.49 ERA). Looking for a quick 
turnaround, General Manager Allard Baird signed several veteran players 
prior to the 2006 season. He secured starting pitchers Mark Redman, Joe 
Mays and Scott Elarton. Baird also signed free agent second baseman Mark 
Grudzielanek, first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz and inked veteran Reggie 
Sanders to a two-year, $10 million deal. Although the new players seemed 
promising, they did not result in many additional wins. The Royals struggled 
through another 100-loss season in 2006, becoming just the eleventh team 
in major league history to lose 100 games in three straight seasons.[citation 
needed] Following a major-league worst 13-37 start, the Royals fired Baird 
on May 31 and announced that Atlanta Braves assistant general manager Dayton 
Moore would be the team's new GM. Muzzy Jackson served as interim GM for 
the Royals, handling the first-year player draft, before Moore took over 
on June 8. One problem often cited by commentators for the losing of those 
seasons was a lack of financial support from the team's owner, David Glass.[14] 
For the first six years Glass owned the Royals (prior to the 2000 season) 
the team payroll was never higher than 21st in the major leagues, and it 
was in the league's bottom six payrolls on five occasions.[10] Glass and 
the Royals also faced a minor controversy off the field in 2006, when the 
team revoked the credentials of two radio journalists present at the press 
conference introducing Moore. The two personalities – Bob Fescoe of WHB 
at the time and Rhonda Moss of KCSP – primarily asked pointed questions 
toward Glass over the firing of Baird. The aftermath included less than 
positive commentary from other media outlets in the metro and a statement 
from the Society of Professional Journalists calling for the reinstatement 
of their credentials. In response, the Royals started a weblog; the first 
entry defended the organization's decision. Kansas City entered the 2007 
season looking to rebound from four out of five seasons ending with at 
least 100 losses, and appeared to be opening up its wallet a bit, with 
a payroll exceeding $60 million for the first time (rising to 22nd-highest 
in the major leagues).[9][10] The Royals outbid the Cubs and Blue Jays 
for free agent righty Gil Meche, signing him to five-year, $55 million 
contract. Reliever Octavio Dotel also inked a one-year, $5 million contract. 
The team also added several new prospects, including Alex Gordon and Billy 
Butler. Among Dayton Moore's first acts as General Manager was instating 
a new motto for the team: "True. Blue. Tradition."[15] In the 2007 MLB 
draft, the Royals selected shortstop Mike Moustakas at #2 overall, signing 
him minutes before the deadline. In June 2007, the Royals had their first 
winning month since July 2003, following up in July with their second-consecutive 
winning month of the season. On August 1, manager Buddy Bell announced 
his intentions to resign following the 2007 season.[16] On September 12, 
the Royals defeated the Minnesota Twins 6-3 to win their 63rd game, guaranteeing 
that they would not lose 100 games in 2007. The victory ended the team's 
string of three consecutive seasons of 100 losses or more, but the team 
still finished in last place in its division with a record of 69-93. Kansas 
City's 2008 season began with the team searching for its new manager. Early 
candidates to succeed Bell included Royals' bench coach Billy Doran,[17] 
former Royals stars George Brett (Brett denied his intentions) and Frank 
White,[17] and Triple-A Omaha manager Mike Jirschele. Former Major League 
managers such as Joe Girardi,[16][17] Jim Fregosi,[17] Ken Macha,[17] and 
Jimy Williams.[17] Atlanta Braves coaches Terry Pendleton and Brian Snitker 
were also in consideration.[18] On October 19, the Royals hired Trey Hillman, 
former manager of the Nippon Ham Fighters and minor league manager of the 
New York Yankees, to be the 15th manager in franchise history.[19] As part 
of the Royals' "New. Blue. Tradition." motto, the Royals introduced a new 
rendition of their classic powder blue uniforms for the 2008 season, and 
ditched their black and sleeveless jerseys.[13] The team wore the powder 
blue uniforms as alternates in weekend home games.[20] The Royals previously 
wore powder blue uniforms from 1973 to 1991. The uniforms were introduced 
on December 6, 2007, at a special event for season ticket holders and were 
modeled by current players such as Alex Gordon and former players such 
as Frank White.[20] The Royals began the 2008 season 3-0 with a sweep over 
the Detroit Tigers, a team that many thought might win the AL pennant. 
Through 13 games, the Royals were 8-5 and in first place, a vast improvement 
over their 3-10 start from the previous season. However, by the All-Star 
break, the Royals were again in losing territory, with their record buoyed 
only by a 13-5 record in inter-league play, the best in the American League. 
During the season many players from the minors came up and made their presence 
felt including Ryan Shealy, Mitch Maier and Mike Aviles. The team finished 
the season in fourth place with a 75-87 record. It was the first time in 
five years the Royals did not finish last in their division. Prior to the 
2009 season, the Royals renovated Kauffman Stadium. After the season began, 
the Royals ended April at the top of the AL Central, all of which raised 
excitement levels among fans. However, the team faded as the season progressed 
and finished the year with a final record of 65-97, in a last-place tie 
in its division (tied with the Cleveland Indians). The 2009 season was 
highlighted by starter Zack Greinke, who didn't allow an earned run in 
the first 24 innings of the season, went on to finish the year with a major 
league-leading 2.16 earned run average, and won the American League Cy 
Young Award. Greinke joined Bret Saberhagen (in 1985 and 1989) and David 
Cone (in 1994) as the only three players in Royals history to receive the 
award. He also set a club record 15 strikeouts in a single game against 
the Cleveland Indians. The following year, in 2010, the Royals began with 
a rocky start, and after the team's record fell to 12-23, general manager 
Dayton Moore fired manager Trey Hillman. After Hillman's departure, former 
Milwaukee Brewers manager Ned Yost took over as manager. Despite the change, 
the Royals finished with a 67-95 record, in last place in the division 
for the sixth time in seven years. In contrast to 2010, the Royals began 
the 2011 season with a hot start, tying for the best record in the American 
League with a 10–4 record after fourteen games. The quick start followed 
a successful spring training season for the Royals. Success faded as the 
season progressed, however. The Royals last had a .500 record at 22-22, 
and then lost five games in a row. By the All-Star break, the Royals had 
a record of 37-54, the worst in the American League. On a more positive 
note, the season also saw the emergence of rookies such as Eric Hosmer 
and Aaron Crow, the team's representative in the 2011 All-Star game, as 
well as Alex Gordon's breakout year in left field, which resulted in him 
receiving a Gold Glove for his excellent display of defense and league 
leading 20 assists. The team ended with a fourth-place finish. On December 
10, 2012, in an attempt to strengthen the pitching staff (which was among 
the worst in baseball in 2012), the Royals traded for Rays pitchers James 
Shields and Wade Davis for Royals top prospect Wil Myers and three others. 
This trade helped catalyze a return to winning records. The 2013 season 
got off to a very good start, as the Royals remained over .500 nearly most 
of April during regular season play. The team also didn't commit an error 
in its first seven games (for 64 2/3 innings) for the first time in team 
history. On September 22, the Royals won their 82nd game of the season, 
to clinch their first winning season since 2003. The Royals finished the 
season 86-76, in third place in the AL Central, securing the team's best 
winning percentage since 1994. The 2014 season was even more successful, 
featuring a return to the post-season for the first time in 29 years. On 
July 21, the Royals had a losing record (48–50) and were 8 games behind 
the Detroit Tigers in the AL Central standings. But spurred by a 22–5 record 
from July 22 to August 19, the Royals surged into first place in the AL 
Central. The Royals reached the top of the division standings on August 
11, after winning their eighth game in a row.[21] This marked the latest 
date the Royals had led their division since August 29, 2003.[21] After 
taking over first place on August 11, the Royals retained the division 
lead for a month, falling out of first place permanently on September 12. 
The Royals finished the regular season one game behind Detroit in the AL 
Central, but secured the franchise's first ever wild card berth and first 
playoff appearance in 29 years. The team's final regular season record 
of 89–73 in 2014 represented the most wins for the Royals since 1989. Coupled 
with a ten-game winning streak in June 2014, the Royals' eight-game winning 
streak in August 2014 was the second streak of at least that long during 
the same season, something the franchise had accomplished only three times 
previously – in 1977, 1978, and 1980. The Royals made the most of that 
playoff run in 2014, going a record 8–0 for the first three rounds. They 
defeated the Oakland Athletics in the Wild Card Game, then swept both the 
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and the Baltimore Orioles in the ALDS and 
ALCS, respectively. However, the Royals fell a win short in the World Series, 
losing to the San Francisco Giants in seven games. Energized by last season's 
playoff run, the 2015 Royals won the American League Central, earning their 
first division title since 1985. In the ALDS against the Houston Astros, 
the Royals trailed in the series 2–1, and were on the verge of elimination 
after trailing by four runs heading into the eighth inning of Game 4. However, 
Kansas City scored seven runs in the final two innings to force a deciding 
game, before eliminating the Astros to advance to the ALCS. In a rematch 
of the 1985 ALCS against the Toronto Blue Jays, the Royals shut down Toronto's 
high-powered offense, winning the series in six games and advancing to 
their second straight World Series. In the 2015 World Series against the 
New York Mets, the Royals continued to live up to their reputation as clutch 
performers. In Game 1, Alex Gordon tied the game in the bottom of the ninth 
inning with a home run, before Eric Hosmer drove in a game-winning sacrifice 
fly in the 14th inning. In Game 4, with the Mets on the verge of tying 
the series, the Royals scored three runs (one unearned) in the eighth inning 
to send them to within a game of the championship. Then in Game 5, with 
the Mets three outs away from forcing Game 6, the Royals scored two runs 
to tie the game, before seldom-used infielder Christian Colón drove in 
the go-ahead run in the 12th inning, helping Kansas City win 7–2 and clinch 
their second World Series championship. All Star Catcher Salvador Pérez 
was named Series MVP for his clutch hitting, excellent play calling and
