As player As manager Cornelius Joseph Ryan (February 27, 1920 – January 
3, 1996) was an American second baseman, third baseman, coach and manager 
in Major League Baseball. A native of New Orleans who attended Louisiana 
State University, Ryan appeared in 1,184 games over 12 seasons, and compiled 
a lifetime batting average of .248 with 58 home runs for the New York Giants, 
Boston Braves, Cincinnati Reds/Redlegs, Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago 
White Sox. On April 16, 1953, Ryan (then with the Phillies) made six hits 
in six at bats in a 14–12 loss to Pittsburgh, tying a then-Major League 
record. He batted and threw right-handed and was listed as 5 feet 11 inches 
(1.80 m) tall and 175 pounds (79 kg). Ryan spent much of his career with 
the Braves, working in three different cities: as a player in Boston (he 
was a utility infielder for the 1948 National League champions); a coach 
and minor league manager for Milwaukee during the late 1950s (he was the 
third-base coach on Fred Haney's staff during the Braves' 1957 world championship 
season); and as a coach, manager and scout for the Atlanta club during 
the 1970s. Ryan succeeded Clyde King as skipper of the Atlanta Braves on 
August 30, 1975,[1] and guided the team to a record of 9–18 over the final 
27 games of the season. In 1977, Ryan began the season as a coach for the 
Texas Rangers. In a season of managerial turmoil, Texas skipper Frank Lucchesi 
was replaced by Eddie Stanky, a teammate of Ryan's on the 1948–49 Braves, 
on June 22. But Stanky resigned after only one game. Ryan then filled the 
breach for six games (with Texas winning two) while the Rangers signed 
Baltimore Orioles coach Billy Hunter as permanent manager. His career managerial 
mark was 11–22 (.333). Ryan remained a Rangers' coach through 1979. During 
the 1960s, Ryan also spent several seasons as a scout and minor league 
manager for the Houston Astros and briefly worked for the Kansas City A's.
