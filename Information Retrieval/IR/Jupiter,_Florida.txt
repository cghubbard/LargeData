Jupiter is the northernmost town in Palm Beach County, Florida, United 
States. According to the 2014 Census Bureau estimate, the town had a total 
population of 60,681. It is part of the Miami metropolitan area, which 
was home to an estimated 6,012,331 people at the 2015 census. It was rated 
as the 9th Happiest Seaside Town in America by Coastal Living in 2012.[9] 
The area where the town now sits was originally named for the Hobe Indian 
tribe which lived at the mouth of the Loxahatchee River, and whose name 
is also preserved in the name of nearby Hobe Sound.[10] A mapmaker misunderstood 
the Spanish spelling "Jobe" of the Indian name "Hobe" and recorded it as 
"Jove".[11] Subsequent mapmakers further misunderstood this to be the Latin 
translation of the god Jupiter, and they anglicized the name from Jove 
to "Jupiter". The Roman god Jupiter (or Zeus in the Greek mythology) is 
the chief Roman god, and god of light, of the sky and weather, and of the 
state and its welfare and its laws. Jupiter's consort was Juno, inspiring 
a neighboring town to name itself "Juno Beach".[12] The most notable landmark 
is the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse, completed in 1860. Made of brick, it was 
painted red in 1910 to cover discoloration caused by humidity. Hurricane 
Jeanne in 2004 sandblasted the paint from the upper portion of the tower, 
and the tower was repainted using a potassium silicate mineral coating. 
The lighthouse is often used as the symbol for Jupiter.[12][13] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 21.1 square 
miles (55 km2), of which 20.0 square miles (52 km2) is land and 1.1 square

of the year is warm to hot in Jupiter, and frost is very rare. As is typical 
in Florida, there are two basic seasons in Jupiter, a mild and dry winter

Daily thundershowers are common in the hot season, though they are brief.

wanted to display a United States flag in his front yard, however, the 
homeowners association had a bylaw prohibiting the display of a flagpole 
in the front lawn. Andres still displayed the flag, while the homeowners 
association went as far as foreclosing his home to cover legal fees after 
being in court at least twenty-eight times. Even after governor Jeb Bush 
visited his home along with members of the local and national media, the 
homeowners association refused to budge. Andres said, "Well, first they 
said that it was going to cost more to cut the grass around the pole, which 
is kind of funny. And then they told me that the flagpole was going to 
take away from the value of the property. And I said, well, then we should 
be able to take away all the trees around here, because they're the same 
as the pole. And my pole is a portable pole. And the state government says 
I can do it." George Andres won and was allowed to display his flag in 
his front lawn with the use of a flagpole. During the last week of July 
2006, President George W. Bush signed the Freedom to Display the American
