Habeas corpus (/ˈheɪbiəs ˈkɔːrpəs/; Medieval Latin meaning literally "You 
may have the body"[1]) is a recourse in law whereby a person can report 
an unlawful detention or imprisonment before a court, usually through a 
prison official.[2] The writ of habeas corpus is known as "the great and 
efficacious writ in all manner of illegal confinement",[Note 1] being a 
remedy available to the meanest against the mightiest. It is a summons 
with the force of a court order; it is addressed to the custodian (a prison 
official for example) and demands that a prisoner be taken before the court, 
and that the custodian present proof of authority, allowing the court to 
determine whether the custodian has lawful authority to detain the prisoner. 
If the custodian is acting beyond his or her authority, then the prisoner 
must be released. Any prisoner, or another person acting on his or her 
behalf, may petition the court, or a judge, for a writ of habeas corpus. 
One reason for the writ to be sought by a person other than the prisoner 
is that the detainee might be held incommunicado. Most civil law jurisdictions 
provide a similar remedy for those unlawfully detained, but this is not 
always called habeas corpus.[3] For example, in some Spanish-speaking nations, 
the equivalent remedy for unlawful imprisonment is the amparo de libertad 
('protection of freedom'). Habeas corpus has certain limitations. Though 
a writ of right, it is not a writ of course.[Note 2] It is technically 
only a procedural remedy; it is a guarantee against any detention that 
is forbidden by law, but it does not necessarily protect other rights, 
such as the entitlement to a fair trial. So if an imposition such as internment 
without trial is permitted by the law, then habeas corpus may not be a 
useful remedy. In some countries, the writ has been temporarily or permanently 
suspended under the pretext of war or state of emergency.[further explanation 
needed] The right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus has nonetheless 
long been celebrated as the most efficient safeguard of the liberty of 
the subject. The jurist Albert Venn Dicey wrote that the British Habeas 
Corpus Acts "declare no principle and define no rights, but they are for 
practical purposes worth a hundred constitutional articles guaranteeing 
individual liberty".[4] The writ of habeas corpus is one of what are called 
the "extraordinary", "common law", or "prerogative writs", which were historically 
issued by the English courts in the name of the monarch to control inferior 
courts and public authorities within the kingdom. The most common of the 
other such prerogative writs are quo warranto, prohibito, mandamus, procedendo, 
and certiorari. The due process for such petitions is not simply civil 
or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority. 
The official who is the respondent must prove his authority to do or not 
do something. Failing this, the court must decide for the petitioner, who 
may be any person, not just an interested party. This differs from a motion 
in a civil process in which the movant must have standing, and bears the 
burden of proof. From Latin habeas, 2nd person singular present subjunctive 
active of habere, "to have", "to hold"; and corpus, accusative singular 
of corpus "body". In reference to more than one person, habeas corpora. 
Literally, the phrase means "you may have the body". The complete phrase 
habeas corpus ad subjiciendum means "you may have the person for the purpose 
of subjecting him/her to (examination)". These are the opening words of 
writs in 14th century Anglo-French documents requiring a person to be brought 
before a court or judge, especially to determine if that person is being 
legally detained.[5] Praecipimus tibi quod corpus A.B. in prisona nostra 
sub custodia tua detentum, ut dicitur, una cum die et causa captionis et 
detentionis suae, quocumque nomine praedictus A.B. censeatur in eadem, 
habeas coram nobis ... ad subjiciendum et recipiendum ea quae curia nostra 
de eo adtunc et ibidem ordinare contigerit in hac parte. Et hoc nullatenus 
omittatis periculo incumbente. Et habeas ibi hoc breve.[6] We command you, 
that the body of A.B. in Our prison under your custody detained, as it 
is said, together with the day and cause of his taking and detention, by 
whatever name the said A.B. may be known therein, you have at our Court 
... to undergo and to receive that which our Court shall then and there 
consider and order in that behalf. Hereof in no way fail, at your peril. 
And have you then there this writ. VICTORIA by the Grace of God, of the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Queen, Defender of the Faith, 
to J.K., Keeper of our Gaol of Jersey, in the Island of Jersey, and to 
J.C. Viscount of said Island, Greeting. We command you that you have the 
body of C.C.W. detained in our prison under your custody, as it is said, 
together with the day and cause of his being taken and detained, by whatsoever 
name he may be called or known, in our Court before us, at Westminster, 
on the 18th day of January next, to undergo and receive all and singular 
such matters and things which our said Court shall then and there consider 
of in this behalf; and have there then this Writ. United States of America, 
Second Judicial Circuit, Southern District of New York, ss.: We command 
you that the body of Charles L. Craig, in your custody detained, as it 
is said, together with the day and cause of his caption and detention, 
you safely have before Honorable Martin T. Manton, United States Circuit 
Judge for the Second Judicial Circuit, within the circuit and district 
aforesaid, to do and receive all and singular those things which the said 
judge shall then and there consider of him in this behalf; and have you 
then and there this writ. The full name of the writ is often used to distinguish 
it from similar ancient writs, also named habeas corpus. These include: 
Habeas Corpus originally stems from the Assize of Clarendon, a re-issuance 
of rights during the reign of Henry II of England.[7] In the 17th century 
the foundations for habeas corpus were "wrongly thought" to have originated 
in Magna Carta.[8] This charter declared that: No Freeman shall be taken 
or imprisoned, or be disseized of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, 
or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not 
pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or 
by the Law of the land. William Blackstone cites the first recorded usage 
of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum in 1305, during the reign of King Edward I. 
However, other writs were issued with the same effect as early as the reign 
of Henry II in the 12th century. Blackstone explained the basis of the 
writ, saying "The King is at all times entitled to have an account, why 
the liberty of any of his subjects is restrained, wherever that restraint 
may be inflicted"[citation needed]. The procedure for issuing a writ of 
habeas corpus was first codified by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679, following 
judicial rulings which had restricted the effectiveness of the writ. A 
previous law (the Habeas Corpus Act 1640) had been passed forty years earlier 
to overturn a ruling that the command of the King was a sufficient answer 
to a petition of habeas corpus[citation needed]. Then, as now, the writ 
of habeas corpus was issued by a superior court in the name of the Sovereign, 
and commanded the addressee (a lower court, sheriff, or private subject) 
to produce the prisoner before the royal courts of law. A habeas corpus 
petition could be made by the prisoner him or herself or by a third party 
on his or her behalf and, as a result of the Habeas Corpus Acts, could 
be made regardless of whether the court was in session, by presenting the 
petition to a judge. Since the 18th century the writ has also been used 
in cases of unlawful detention by private individuals, most famously in 
Somersett's Case (1772), where the black slave Somersett was ordered to 
be freed.[9] In that case these famous words are said to have been uttered 
"The air of England has long been too pure for a slave, and every man is 
free who breathes it".[10] During the Seven Years' War and later conflicts, 
the Writ was used on behalf of soldiers and sailors pressed into military 
and naval service.[11] The Habeas Corpus Act 1816 introduced some changes 
and expanded the territoriality of the legislation. The privilege of habeas 
corpus has been suspended or restricted several times during English history, 
most recently during the 18th and 19th centuries. Although internment without 
trial has been authorised by statute since that time, for example during 
the two World Wars and the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the habeas corpus 
procedure has in modern times always technically remained available to 
such internees. However, as habeas corpus is only a procedural device to 
examine the lawfulness of a prisoner's detention, so long as the detention 
is in accordance with an Act of Parliament, the petition for habeas corpus 
is unsuccessful. Since the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998, the courts 
have been able to declare an Act of Parliament to be incompatible with 
the European Convention on Human Rights, but such a declaration of incompatibility 
has no legal effect unless and until it is acted upon by the government.[citation 
needed] The wording of the writ of habeas corpus implies that the prisoner 
is brought to the court for the legality of the imprisonment to be examined. 
However, rather than issuing the writ immediately and waiting for the return 
of the writ by the custodian, modern practice in England is for the original 
application to be followed by a hearing with both parties present to decide 
the legality of the detention, without any writ being issued. If the detention 
is held to be unlawful, the prisoner can usually then be released or bailed 
by order of the court without having to be produced before it. It is also 
possible for individuals held by the state to petition for judicial review, 
and individuals held by non-state entities to apply for an injunction[citation 
needed]. With the development of modern public law, applications for habeas 
corpus have been to some extent discouraged, in favour of applications 
for judicial review.[12] The Writ, however, maintains its vigour, and was 
held by the UK Supreme Court to be available in respect of a prisoner captured 
by British forces in Afghanistan, albeit that the Secretary of State made 
a valid return to the Writ justifying the detention of the claimant.[13] 
The writ of habeas corpus as a procedural remedy is part of Australia's 
English law inheritance.[14] In 2005, the Australian parliament passed 
the Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005. Some legal experts questioned the 
constitutionality of the act, due in part to limitations it placed on habeas 
corpus.[15][16][17] Habeas corpus rights are part of the British legal 
tradition inherited by Canada. The rights exist in the common law but have 
been enshrined in the Constitution Act 1982, under Section Ten of the Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms.[18] This states that "Everyone has the right on 
arrest or detention ... (c) to have the validity of the detention determined 
by way of habeas corpus and to be released if the detention is not lawful". 
Suspension of the writ in Canadian history occurred famously during the 
October Crisis, during which the War Measures Act was invoked by the Governor 
General of Canada on the constitutional advice of Prime Minister Pierre 
Trudeau, who had received a request from the Quebec Cabinet. The Act was 
also used to justify German, Slavic, and Ukrainian Canadian internment 
during the First World War, and the internment of German-Canadians, Italian-Canadians 
and Japanese-Canadians during the Second World War. The writ was suspended 
for several years following the Battle of Fort Erie (1866) during the Fenian 
Rising, though the suspension was only ever applied to suspects in the 
Thomas D'Arcy McGee assassination.[19] The writ is available where there 
is no other adequate remedy. However, a superior court always has the discretion 
to grant the writ even in the face of an alternative remedy (see May v 
Ferndale Institution).[20] Under the Criminal Code the writ is largely 
unavailable if a statutory right of appeal exists, whether or not this 
right has been exercised. A fundamental human right in the "1789 Declaration 
of the Rights of Man" drafted by Lafayette in cooperation with Thomas Jefferson,[21] 
the guarantees against arbitrary detention are enshrined in the French 
Constitution and regulated by the Penal Code. The safeguards are equivalent 
to those found under the Habeas-Corpus provisions found in Germany, the 
United States and several Commonwealth countries. The French system of 
accountability prescribes severe penalties for ministers, police officers 
and civil and judiciary authorities who either violate or fail to enforce 
the law. "Article 7 of [1789] Declaration also provides that "No individual 
may be accused, arrested, or detained except where the law so prescribes, 
and in accordance with the procedure it has laid down"... The Constitution 
further states that "No one may be arbitrarily detained. The judicial authority, 
guardian of individual liberty, ensures the observance of this principle 
under the condition specified by law." Its article 5 provides that everyone 
has the right to liberty and sets forth permissible circumstances under 
which people may be deprived of their liberty and procedural safeguards 
in case of detention. In particular, it states that "anyone deprived of 
his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings 
by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a 
court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful".[22] France 
and the United States played a synergistic role in the international team, 
led by Eleanor Roosevelt, which crafted the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. The French judge and Nobel Peace Laureate René Cassin produced 
the first draft[23][24] and argued against arbitrary detentions. René Cassin 
and the French team subsequently championed the Habeas-Corpus provisions 
enshrined in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights 
and Fundamental Freedoms.[25] Germany has constitutional guarantees against 
improper detention and have been implemented in statutory law in a manner 
that can be considered as equivalent to writs of habeas corpus. Article 
104, paragraph 1 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany provides 
that deprivations of liberty may be imposed only on the basis of a specific 
enabling statute that also must include procedural rules. Article 104, 
paragraph 2 requires that any arrested individual be brought before a judge 
by the end of the day following the day of the arrest. For those detained 
as criminal suspects, article 104, paragraph 3 specifically requires that 
the judge must grant a hearing to the suspect in order to rule on the detention. 
Restrictions on the power of the authorities to arrest and detain individuals 
also emanate from article 2 paragraph 2 of the Basic Law which guarantees 
liberty and requires a statutory authorization for any deprivation of liberty. 
In addition, several other articles of the Basic Law have a bearing on 
the issue. The most important of these are article 19, which generally 
requires a statutory basis for any infringements of the fundamental rights 
guaranteed by the Basic Law while also guaranteeing judicial review; article 
20, paragraph 3, which guarantees the rule of law; and article 3 which 
guarantees equality. In particular, a constitutional obligation to grant 
remedies for improper detention is required by article 19, paragraph 4 
of the Basic Law, which provides as follows: "Should any person's right 
be violated by public authority, he may have recourse to the courts. If 
no other jurisdiction has been established, recourse shall be to the ordinary 
courts."[26] The Indian judiciary, in a catena of cases, has effectively 
resorted to the writ of habeas corpus to secure release of a person from 
illegal detention.[27] For example, in October 2009, the Karnataka High 
Court heard a habeas corpus petition filed by the parents of a girl who 
married a Muslim boy from Kannur district and was allegedly confined in 
a madrasa in Malapuram town.[28] Usually, in most other jurisdictions, 
the writ is directed at police authorities. The extension to non-state 
authorities has its grounds in two cases: the 1898 Queen's Bench case of 
Ex Parte Daisy Hopkins, wherein the Proctor of Cambridge University did 
detain and arrest Hopkins without his jurisdiction, and Hopkins was released 
[29] and that of Somerset v Stewart, in which an African slave whose master 
had moved to London was freed by action of the writ. The Indian judiciary 
has dispensed with the traditional doctrine of locus standi, so that if 
a detained person is not in a position to file a petition, it can be moved 
on his behalf by any other person. The scope of habeas relief has expanded 
in recent times by actions of the Indian judiciary.[30] In 1976, the habeas 
writ was used in the Rajan case, a student victim of torture in local police 
custody during the nationwide Emergency in India. On 12 March 2014, Subrata 
Roy's counsel approached the Chief Justice moving a habeas corpus petition. 
It was also filed by the Panthers Party to protest the imprisonment of 
Anna Hazare, a social activist. In the Republic of Ireland, access to a 
similar remedy to habeas corpus is guaranteed by Article 40.4 of the 1937 
constitution. This guarantees "personal liberty" to each individual and 
outlines a detailed procedure. It does not mention the Latin term but includes 
the English phrase "produce the body". The constitution provides that this 
procedure is not binding on the Defence Forces during a state of war or 
armed rebellion. The term 'habeas corpus' as used in the Rules of the Superior 
Courts does not refer to the constitutional procedure outlined below, but 
to provisions still operable of the Habeas Courpus Acts- The State (Ahern) 
v Cotter [1982] IR 188. The expression 'order of Habeas Corpus' does not 
include an order made pursuant to Article 40, section 4 of the Constitution. 
Order 84 r 1(2) RSC. Article 40.4.2° states that a prisoner, or anyone 
acting on his behalf, may make a complaint to the High Court (or to any 
High Court judge) of unlawful detention. The court must then investigate 
the matter "forthwith" and may order that the defendant bring the prisoner 
before the court and give reasons for his detention. The court must immediately 
release the detainee unless it is satisfied that he is being held lawfully. 
The full text of the provision is as follows: Upon complaint being made 
by or on behalf of any person to the High Court or any judge thereof alleging 
that such person is being unlawfully detained, the High Court and any and 
every judge thereof to whom such complaint is made shall forthwith enquire 
into the said complaint and may order the person in whose custody such 
person is detained to produce the body of such person before the High Court 
on a named day and to certify in writing the grounds of his detention, 
and the High Court shall, upon the body of such person being produced before 
that Court and after giving the person in whose custody he is detained 
an opportunity of justifying the detention, order the release of such person 
from such detention unless satisfied that he is being detained in accordance 
with the law. [Italics added] The state inherited habeas corpus as part 
of the common law when it seceded from the United Kingdom in 1922, but 
the remedy was also guaranteed by Article 6 of the Constitution of the 
Irish Free State in force from 1922 to 1937. A similar provision was included 
when the current constitution was adopted in 1937. Since that date, habeas 
corpus has been restricted by two constitutional amendments, the Second 
Amendment in 1941 and the Sixteenth Amendment in 1996. Before the Second 
Amendment, an individual detained had the constitutional right to apply 
to any High Court judge for a writ of habeas corpus and to as many High 
Court judges as he wished. Since the Second Amendment, a prisoner has had 
only the right to apply to one judge, and, once a writ has been issued, 
the President of the High Court has authority to choose the judge or panel 
of three judges who will decide the case. The amendment also added a requirement 
that if the High Court believes someone's detention to be invalid due to 
the unconstitutionality of a law, it must refer the matter to the Irish 
Supreme Court and may only release the individual on bail in the interim. 
In 1965, the Supreme Court ruled in the O'Callaghan case that the provisions 
of the constitution meant that an individual charged with a crime could 
be refused bail only if she was likely to flee or to interfere with witnesses 
or evidence. Since the Sixteenth Amendment, it has been possible for a 
court to take into account whether a person has committed serious crimes 
while on bail in the past. In Italy the principle of habeas corpus is enshrined 
in Article 13 of the Constitution, which states:[31] "Personal liberty 
is inviolable. No one may be detained, inspected, or searched nor otherwise 
subjected to any restriction of personal liberty except by order of the 
Judiciary stating a reason and only in such cases and in such manner as 
provided by the law. In exceptional circumstances and under such conditions 
of necessity and urgency as shall conclusively be defined by the law, the 
police may take provisional measures that shall be referred within 48 hours 
to the Judiciary for validation and which, in default of such validation 
in the following 48 hours, shall be revoked and considered null and void. 
Any act of physical and moral violence against a person subjected to restriction 
of personal liberty shall be punished. The law shall establish the maximum 
duration of preventive detention." In Malaysia, the remedy of habeas corpus 
is guaranteed by the federal constitution, although not by name. Article 
5(2) of the Constitution of Malaysia provides that "Where complaint is 
made to a High Court or any judge thereof that a person is being unlawfully 
detained the court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied 
that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the 
court and release him". As there are several statutes, for example, the 
Internal Security Act 1960, that still permit detention without trial, 
the procedure is usually effective in such cases only if it can be shown 
that there was a procedural error in the way that the detention was ordered. 
In New Zealand, habeas corpus may be invoked against the government or 
private individuals. In 2006, a child was allegedly kidnapped by his maternal 
grandfather after a custody dispute. The father began habeas corpus proceedings 
against the mother, the grandfather, the grandmother, the great grandmother, 
and another person alleged to have assisted in the kidnap of the child. 
The mother did not present the child to the court and so was imprisoned 
for contempt of court.[32] She was released when the grandfather came forward 
with the child in late January 2007. Issuance of a writ is an exercise 
of an extraordinary jurisdiction of the superior courts in Pakistan. A 
writ of habeas corpus may be issued by any High Court of a province in 
Pakistan. Article 199 of the 1973 Constitution of the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan, specifically provides for the issuance of a writ of habeas 
corpus, empowering the courts to exercise this prerogative. Subject to 
the Article 199 of the Constitution, "A High Court may, if it is satisfied 
that no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of 
any person, make an order that a person in custody within the territorial 
jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it so that the Court may satisfy 
itself that he is not being held in custody without a lawful authority 
or in an unlawful manner". The hallmark of extraordinary constitutional 
jurisdiction is to keep various functionaries of State within the ambit 
of their authority. Once a High Court has assumed jurisdiction to adjudicate 
the matter before it, justiciability of the issue raised before it is beyond 
question. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has stated clearly that the use 
of words "in an unlawful manner" implies that the court may examine, if 
a statute has allowed such detention, whether it was a colorable exercise 
of the power of authority. Thus, the court can examine the malafides of 
the action taken.[33] In the Bill of Rights of the Philippine constitution, 
habeas corpus is guaranteed in terms almost identically to those used in 
the U.S. Constitution. in Article 3, Section 15 of the Constitution of 
the Philippines states that "The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus 
shall not be suspended except in cases of invasion or rebellion when the 
public safety requires it". In 1971, after the Plaza Miranda bombing, the 
Marcos administration, under Ferdinand Marcos, suspended habeas corpus 
in an effort to stifle the oncoming insurgency, having blamed the Filipino 
Communist Party for the events of August 21. Many considered this to be 
a prelude to Martial Law. After widespread protests, however, the Marcos 
administration decided to reintroduce the writ. In December 2009, habeas 
corpus was suspended in Maguindanao as the province was placed under martial 
law. This occurred in response to the Maguindanao massacre.[34] In 2016, 
President Rodrigo Duterte said he is planning on suspending the habeas 
corpus.[35] The Parliament of Scotland passed a law to have the same effect 
as habeas corpus in the 18th century. This is now known as the Criminal 
Procedure Act 1701 c.6.[36] It was originally called "the Act for preventing 
wrongful imprisonment and against undue delays in trials". It is still 
in force although certain parts have been repealed. In 1526, the Fuero 
Nuevo of the Señorío de Vizcaya established a form of habeas corpus in 
the territory of the Señorío de Vizcaya. The present Constitution of Spain 
states that "A habeas corpus procedure shall be provided for by law to 
ensure the immediate handing over to the judicial authorities of any person 
illegally arrested". The statute which regulates the procedure is the Law 
of Habeas Corpus of 24 May 1984, which provides that a person imprisoned 
may, on her or his own or through a third person, allege that she or he 
is imprisoned unlawfully and request to appear before a judge. The request 
must specify the grounds on which the detention is considered to be unlawful, 
which can be, for example, that the custodian holding the prisoner does 
not have the legal authority, that the prisoner's constitutional rights 
have been violated, or that he has been subjected to mistreatment. The 
judge may then request additional information if needed, and may issue 
a habeas corpus order, at which point the custodian has 24 hours to bring 
the prisoner before the judge. The United States inherited habeas corpus 
from the English common law. In England, the writ was issued in the name 
of the monarch. When the original thirteen American colonies declared independence, 
and became a republic based on popular sovereignty, any person, in the 
name of the people, acquired authority to initiate such writs. The U.S. 
Constitution specifically includes the habeas procedure in the Suspension 
Clause (Clause 2), located in Article One, Section 9. This states that 
"The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless 
when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it". 
Section 9 is under Article 1 which states, "legislative Powers herein granted 
shall be vested in the Congress of the United States ..." The writ of habeas 
corpus ad subjiciendum is a civil, not criminal, ex parte proceeding in 
which a court inquires as to the legitimacy of a prisoner's custody. Typically, 
habeas corpus proceedings are to determine whether the court that imposed 
sentence on the defendant had jurisdiction and authority to do so, or whether 
the defendant's sentence has expired. Habeas corpus is also used as a legal 
avenue to challenge other types of custody such as pretrial detention or 
detention by the United States Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
pursuant to a deportation proceeding. Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses 
Grant suspended habeas corpus during the Civil War and Reconstruction for 
some places or types of cases.[37][38]During World War II, President Franklin 
D. Roosevelt suspended habeas corpus. Following the September 11 attacks, 
President George W. Bush attempted to place Guantanamo Bay detainees outside 
of the jurisdiction of habeas corpus, but the Supreme Court of the United 
States overturned this action in Boumediene v. Bush. In 1430, King Władysław 
II Jagiełło of Poland granted the Privilege of Jedlnia, which proclaimed, 
Neminem captivabimus nisi iure victum ("We will not imprison anyone except 
if convicted by law"). This revolutionary innovation in civil libertarianism 
gave Polish citizens due process-style rights that did not exist in any 
other European country for another 250 years. Originally, the Privilege 
of Jedlnia was restricted to the nobility (the szlachta), but it was extended 
to cover townsmen in the 1791 Constitution. Importantly, social classifications 
in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were not as rigid as in other European 
countries; townspeople and Jews were sometimes ennobled. The Privilege 
of Jedlnia provided broader coverage than many subsequently enacted habeas 
corpus laws because Poland's nobility constituted an unusually large percentage 
of the country's total population, which was Europe's largest. As a result, 
by the 16th century, it was protecting the liberty of between 500 thousand 
and a million Poles.[39] In South Africa and other countries whose legal 
systems are based on Roman-Dutch law, the interdictum de homine libero 
exhibendo is the equivalent of the writ of habeas corpus.[40] In South 
Africa, it has been entrenched in the Bill of Rights, which provides in 
section 35(2)(d) that every detained person has the right to challenge 
the lawfulness of the detention in person before a court and, if the detention 
is unlawful, to be released. In the 1950s, American lawyer Luis Kutner 
began advocating an international writ of habeas corpus to protect individual 
human rights. In 1952, he filed a petition for a "United Nations Writ of 
Habeas Corpus" on behalf of William N. Oatis, an American journalist jailed 
the previous year by the Communist government of Czechoslovakia.[41] Alleging 
that Czechoslovakia had violated Oatis's rights under the United Nations 
Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that the United 
Nations General Assembly had "inherent power" to fashion remedies for human 
rights violations, the petition was filed with the United Nations Commission 
on Human Rights.[42] The Commission forwarded the petition to Czechoslovakia, 
but no other United Nations action was taken.[42] Oatis was released in 
1953. Kutner went on to publish numerous articles and books advocating 
the creation of an "International Court of Habeas Corpus".[43] Article 
3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that "everyone 
has the right to life, liberty and security of person". Article 5 of the 
European Convention on Human Rights goes further and calls for persons 
detained to have the right to challenge their detention, providing at article 
5.4: "Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall 
be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention 
shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention
