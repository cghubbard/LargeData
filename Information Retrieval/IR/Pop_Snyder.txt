Charles N. "Pop" Snyder (October 6, 1854 â€“ October 29, 1924)[1] was an 
American catcher, manager, and umpire in Major League Baseball. His 18-season 
playing career began in 1873 for the Washington Blue Legs of the National 
Association, and ended with the 1891 Washington Statesmen.[2] He led his 
league in several defensive categories during his career, including putouts 
by a catcher three times, assists by a catcher three times, double plays 
by a catcher three times, and fielding percentage by a catcher three times.[2] 
He became a player-manager in 1882, when the Cincinnati Red Stockings of 
the American Association, formed.[1] His team won the American Association 
pennant that first season, his second as a player; he was a member of the 
National League champion Boston Red Caps team.[1] He was the manager for 
the Red Stockings, now known as the Reds, for the first two seasons of 
the Red Stockings existence, and part of third when he replaced Will White 
despite a 44-27 mark after 71 games. In 1891, at the age of 36, he played 
and managed his last season, this time when the Washington Statesmen entered 
the National League.[1] During his playing and managerial career, he would 
perform duties as an umpire when the need arose, but it wasn't until 1890, 
in the Players' League, that he began to see significant time in that capacity. 
It was after his career as a player and manager that began a full-time 
career as an umpire. This lasted intermittently from 1892 to 1901. In total 
he umpired 390 games in four different leagues; the National Association, 
the American Association, the Players' League, and the National League.[1] 
Snyder died in his hometown of Washington, D.C. at the age of 70, and is 
interred at Glenwood Cemetery in D.C.[1] He also hold the all-time major
