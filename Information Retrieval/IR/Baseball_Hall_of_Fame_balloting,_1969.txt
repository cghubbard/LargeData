Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1969 followed the system reintroduced 
in 1968. The Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) voted once 
by mail to select from recent major league players and elected two, Roy 
Campanella and Stan Musial. The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions 
to consider executives, managers, umpires, and earlier major league players. 
It selected two players, Stan Coveleski and Waite Hoyt. The BBWAA was authorized 
to elect players active in 1949 or later, but not after 1963; the ballot 
included candidates from the 1968 ballot who received at least 5% of the 
vote but were not elected, along withselected players, chosen by a screening 
committee, whose last appearance was in 1963. All 10-year members of the 
BBWAA were eligible to vote. Voters were instructed to cast votes for up 
to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the 
ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. The ballot consisted 
of 46 players; a total of 340 ballots were cast, with 255 votes required 
for election. A total of 2,604 individual votes were cast, an average of 
7.66 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote will 
not appear on future BBWAA ballots but may eventually be considered by 
the Veterans Committee. Candidates who were eligible for the first time 
are indicated here with a â€ . The two candidates who received at least 75% 
of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates 
who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in italics. 
The 20 candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming 
ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with a *. Schoolboy 
Rowe, Dixie Walker and Mort Cooper were on the ballot for the final time.
