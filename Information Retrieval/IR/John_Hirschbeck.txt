John Francis Hirschbeck (born September 7, 1954) is a former umpire for 
Major League Baseball. He worked in the American League from 1984 to 1999 
and worked in both leagues from 2000 to 2016. He was a crew chief at the 
time of his retirement, and wore uniform number 17 throughout his career. 
Hirschbeck announced his retirement following the 2016 season.[1] In 2000, 
Hirschbeck was elected as the first president of the newly certified World 
Umpires Association, a position he held until 2009. Hirschbeck umpired 
in the All-Star Game three times (1989, 2004, 2013), in the Division Series 
10 times (AL: 1995, 1998, 1999, 2005; NL: 2001, 2003, 2006, 2010, 2013, 
2016), the American League Championship Series 5 times (1990, 1997, 2000, 
2004, 2015), and the World Series five times (1995, 2006, 2010, 2013, 2016) 
acting as crew chief the latter three times. Though umpires typically prefer 
to stay out of the public eye, Hirschbeck found himself in the spotlight 
after an on-field incident in the final weekend of the regular season on 
Friday, September 27, 1996 in Toronto when Baltimore Orioles second baseman 
Roberto Alomar became involved in a heated, two-way argument with Hirschbeck 
over a close called third strike. Hirschbeck ejected Alomar from the game, 
and Alomar subsequently spat in Hirschbeck's face, claiming that the umpire 
had used a degrading ethnic slur against him. Lip readers contend that 
Hirschbeck called Alomar "a faggot" as Alomar walked away, exacerbating 
an already tense situation.[2] Alomar, along with other MLB players, claimed 
that Hirschbeck's personality had become extremely bitter since one son 
had died from adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and another son had been diagnosed 
with it. Having heard Alomar's remarks, Hirschbeck charged into the Orioles' 
clubhouse the next day and he had to be restrained by fellow umpire, Jim 
Joyce. Alomar was suspended for five games and required to donate $50,000 
to ALD research. By October 5, Hirschbeck said he had forgiven Alomar for 
the incident. The called third strike which provoked the confrontation 
was described by some observers as a "bad" call.[3] Alomar and Hirschbeck 
made public apologies to each other on April 22, 1997, standing at home 
plate and shaking hands in front of the crowd before an Orioles game. "You 
know, I just wanted to put it behind us," Hirschbeck said on an interview 
to the Arizona Republic in 2005. "I said something to him once and it just 
flooded out how sorry he was." Hirschbeck and Alomar joined forces to raise 
awareness about ALD and to raise funds for research. They came to regard 
each other as friends. When asked about the incident at his retirement 
in 2005, Alomar said, "That, to me, is over and done. It happened over 
nine years ago. We are now great friends. We have done some things with 
charity. God put us maybe in this situation for something." Alomar later 
made a donation of $252,000 for research on adrenoleukodystrophy. In 2002, 
MLB sued the umpires union in a complaint filed in U.S. District Court 
in Manhattan in an attempt to discipline Hirschbeck, the union's head. 
The complaint alleged that Hirschbeck had ordered a member of his umpiring 
crew not to warn a pitcher for intentionally throwing at a batter.[4] The 
case alleged that Hirschbeck's performance as an umpire "was well below 
par" and specifically mentioned a May 4, 2002, game in Cleveland which 
Hirschbeck had umpired at home plate. According to vice president for umpiring 
Ralph Nelson, thirty of the 127 pitches Hirschbeck had called were incorrect, 
with twenty two pitches off the plate called strikes by the umpire. Nelson 
referred to Hirschbeck's performance in that game as the worst "by any 
umpire in any Questec game this year by a substantial margin."[5] Baseball 
had already issued a warning letter to Hirschbeck on May 10, 2002, accusing 
him of misconduct during a game he had worked on April 28 of that year.[6] 
In that letter, it was charged that Hirschbeck's actions violated the Official 
Playing Rules of Major League Baseball, and that Hirschbeck's threat to 
his supervisor that he would issue needless warnings to pitchers in future 
games and instruct other umpires to do the same would have "serious repercussions" 
for Hirschbeck if carried out.[7] In 2003, Hirschbeck was investigated 
by MLB after alleged personal threats were made against a top major league 
official. The threats were alleged to have been made during a discussion 
between Hirschbeck and Rob Manfred, management's top labor lawyer. Hirschbeck 
was allegedly upset that a personal acquaintance was one of 26 baseball 
employees laid off earlier that year.[8] On May 5, 2013, Hirschbeck ejected 
Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals after the outfielder argued a 
check-swing call for strike three in the first inning of a game against 
the Pittsburgh Pirates. Though Harper later apologized, Hirschbeck was 
the aggressor in the confrontation according to some observers,[9] as he 
started yelling at Harper and walking toward him after the batter had raised 
his hands in protest. Adam Kilgore of the Washington Post wrote that Hirschbeck 
should have simply turned his back and ignored Harper rather than escalating 
the incident. The incident highlighted what was seen by some as a new age 
of diva umpires who seemingly want to become part of the storyline, according 
to some observers, with Hirschbeck's actions singled out and referred to 
as a "display of egotism".[10] During an ALCS game between the Kansas City 
Royals and Toronto Blue Jays on October 19, 2015, Hirschbeck ejected Toronto 
shortstop Troy Tulowitzki between innings after the player had argued a 
called third strike.[11] Hirschbeck was accused of escalating the situation 
by approaching Tulowitzki after the fact,[12] actions which were referred 
to by some observers as "simply unacceptable".[13] Hirschbeck was the first 
base umpire at Yankee Stadium when David Wells pitched a perfect game against 
the Minnesota Twins on May 17, 1998.[14] He was behind the plate on August 
7, 2007 at AT&T Park in San Francisco when Giants slugger Barry Bonds hit 
his record-breaking 756th career home run.[15] Hirschbeck was the home 
plate umpire on October 6, 2010 for the first NLDS game between the Philadelphia 
Phillies and the Cincinnati Reds at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia 
when the Phillies' Roy Halladay pitched a no-hitter.[16] He was selected 
as crew chief for the World Series three times â€“ 2010[17] (when he worked 
behind home plate in Game 1),[18] 2013[19] (home plate Game 1),[20] and 
2016[21] (home plate Game 3).[22] According to Hirschbeck, he began umpiring 
as a senior in high school; short of money to attend his prom, he started 
umpiring Little League for $5 a game. He continued in college and umpired 
in the minor leagues for seven years.[23] He is a 1976 graduate of Central 
Connecticut State University in New Britain, Connecticut, where he played 
baseball. John's brother Mark Hirschbeck served as an umpire from 1988 
to 2003, with the pair becoming the first brothers to become major league 
umpires. On April 8, 2014, Hirschbeck's son Michael died, 21 years after 
son John Drew's death from ALD. The cause of death was not immediately 
known.[24] In January 2015, Hirschbeck announced his planned return to 
baseball for the 2015 season, explaining how important baseball was to 
Michael.[25] On August 23, 2009, Hirschbeck was diagnosed with a form of 
testicular cancer described as treatable by Dr. Stephen Jones of the Cleveland 
Clinic, causing Hirschbeck, who had missed the entire 2008 season following 
back surgery, to miss the remainder of the 2009 season as well. After the 
tumor was removed via orchiectomy, the cancer was given a 10 percent chance 
of recurrence, and Hirschbeck returned for the 2010 season.[26] After working 
a reduced schedule in 2011 due to back pain, Hirschbeck's cancer returned 
and he missed the 2012 MLB season.[27] His last contest before returning 
to umpiring's disabled list was Game 162 of the 2011 regular season between 
the Boston Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles. In August 2012 Hirschbeck advised 
he was again cancer-free and made plans to return to work in 2013.[28] 
He worked his first Spring Training game after his return to MLB on February 
28, 2013, serving as the first base umpire for a Boston-Pittsburgh game.[29]
