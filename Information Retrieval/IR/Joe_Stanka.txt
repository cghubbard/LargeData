Joe Donald Stanka (born July 23, 1931) is a retired American professional 
baseball player. The right-handed pitcher from Hammon, Oklahoma played 
for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball (1959), and the Nankai 
Hawks and Taiyo Whales in the Japanese professional leagues (1960–66). 
He stood 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) tall and weighed 201 pounds (91 kg). 
After attending Oklahoma State University, Stanka spent most of his career 
in the minor leagues, making his Major League debut with the White Sox 
in 1959 at age 28. His big-league career consisted of only two appearances 
that year. In his first MLB game, September 2 against the Detroit Tigers, 
Stanka entered the game in relief of starting pitcher Barry Latman in the 
fifth inning at Comiskey Park with Chicago trailing 3–0. He retired the 
Tigers without further damage. Then, in their half of the fifth, the White 
Sox exploded for 11 runs, with Stanka contributing to the rally with a 
single in his first big-league at bat. He went on to pitch 3 1⁄3 innings 
of one-hit, one-run relief and was credited with the win in an 11–4 ChiSox 
triumph.[1] Stanka pitched in only one more contest that month, a two-inning 
relief stint against the Cleveland Indians, September 5. The White Sox 
and Indians were then embroiled in a pennant race that ultimately delivered 
Chicago its first American League title since 1959. Stanka did not appear 
in the 1959 World Series. In two games and 5 1⁄3 MLB innings pitched, Stanka 
allowed two hits, two earned runs and four bases on balls; he struck out 
three. His career 1–0 win–loss record was accompanied by a 3.38 earned 
run average. He signed with the Nankai Hawks (current Fukuoka SoftBank 
Hawks) during the 1959 off-season. He was one of the first players to be 
signed from the Triple-A class of the minor leagues, and the team calculated 
that he should be able to win over 20 games in the Japanese Pacific League. 
Stanka entered the starting rotation in his first year, and marked a 17–12 
record in his first year, leading the league with 103 walks. He played 
his best season in 1964, winning 26 games to receive the league MVP award. 
He pitched shutouts in Games 1, 6, and 7 of the Japan Series against the 
Hanshin Tigers to win the Japan Series MVP award as well. He continued 
to pitch for the Hawks in 1965, but left the team after his eldest son 
died in a tragic accident. He played for the Taiyo Whales in 1966 before 
retiring. He is tied with Gene Bacque for the most wins among foreign players
