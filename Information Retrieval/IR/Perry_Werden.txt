Percival Wheritt "Perry" Werden (July 21, 1865 – January 9, 1934) was an 
American baseball player. He was a first baseman for the St. Louis Maroons 
(1884), Washington Nationals (1888), Toledo Maumees (1890), Baltimore Orioles 
(1891), St. Louis Browns (1892–1893) and Louisville Colonels (1897). Werden 
played as a pitcher in 1884 where he had a 12–1 win-loss record (leading 
the Union Association in winning percentage at .923), 16 Games, 16 Games 
Started, 12 Complete Games, 1 Shutout, 141 ⅓ Innings Pitched, 113 Hits 
Allowed, 61 Runs Allowed, 31 Earned Runs Allowed, 1 Home Run Allowed, 22 
Walks Allowed, 51 Strikeouts and a 1.97 ERA. During this season, he helped 
the Maroons win the first and only Union Association pennant. An arm injury 
moved Werden to first base and in 7 seasons he played in 693 Games, 2,740 
At Bats, 444 Runs, 773 Hits, 109 Doubles, 87 Triples, 26 Home Runs, 439 
RBI, 150 Stolen Bases, 281 Walks, .282 Batting Average, .359 On-base percentage, 
.414 Slugging Percentage, 1,134 Total Bases and 5 Sacrifice Hits. Werden 
had a remarkable minor league career. For the Minneapolis Millers of the 
Western League in 1894, he hit .417 with 42 home runs. The next season 
he improved in both categories, hitting .428 with 45 home runs. These were 
astounding home run totals for the time (helped by the short outfield fence 
distance at their home field): for example, Sam Thompson led the National 
League in home runs with 18 in 1895. No one would hit more than 29 until 
Babe Ruth hit 54 in 1920. Werden retired with a career .341 batting average 
with five home run titles in the minor leagues. He died in Minneapolis, 
Minnesota at the age of 68, and was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in
