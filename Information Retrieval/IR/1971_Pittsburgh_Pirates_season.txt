The 1971 Pittsburgh Pirates season was the 90th season for the Pittsburgh 
Pirates franchise; their 85th in the National League. It involved the Pirates 
finishing first in the National League East with a record of 97 wins and 
65 losses. They defeated the San Francisco Giants three games to one in 
the National League Championship Series and beat the Baltimore Orioles 
four games to three in the World Series. The Pirates were managed by Danny 
Murtaugh, and played their first full season at Three Rivers Stadium, which 
had opened in July the year before. In 1971, the Pirates became the first 
Major League Baseball team to field an all-black starting lineup.[3] That 
lineup, which took the field on September 1, was Rennie Stennett, Gene 
Clines, Roberto Clemente, Willie Stargell, Manny Sanguillén, Dave Cash, 
Al Oliver, Jackie Hernández, and Dock Ellis.[4] Infielders Other batters
