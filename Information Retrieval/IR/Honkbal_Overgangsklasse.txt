The Honkbal Overgangsklasse (Dutch for Baseball Transition League) is the 
second highest level of professional baseball in the Netherlands. It is 
a twelve-team league that plays a 22-game schedule followed by two separate 
15-game schedules for the best six teams and the weakest six teams, and 
is overseen by the KNBSB. Games are played principally on weekends. The 
season runs from April to August and is followed by a promotion and relegation 
system with the highest level of baseball in the Netherlands, the Honkbal 
Hoofdklasse, so that the composition of the top level may change from year 
to year. The 2011 Honkbal Overgangsklasse season began April 8, 2011.[1] 
The 2011 Honkbal Overgangsklasse 1–6 (best teams) season began June 25, 
2011 and ended September 4, 2011.[2] The 2011 Honkbal Overgangsklasse 7–12 
(weakest teams) season began June 25, 2011 and ended September 4, 2011.[3]
