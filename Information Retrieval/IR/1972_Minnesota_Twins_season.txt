The 1972 Minnesota Twins finished 77-77, third in the American League West. 
On May 12, in a twenty-two inning match which concluded a day later, Danny 
Thompson went 0 for 10 with a sacrifice bunt, dropping his batting average 
39 points over one game. He and César Tovar set a team record with their 
eleven plate appearances. After a slow start, manager Bill Rigney was replaced 
by Frank Quilici in early July. On July 9, Rich Reese hit his third pinch-hit 
grand slam home run, tying a major league record in doing so. Rothsay, 
Minnesota, native Dave Goltz made his major league debut on July 18 -- 
he is the first Minnesotan drafted by the Minnesota Twins to make the big 
league club. He gave up one hit in 3⅔ innings. Only one Twin made the All-Star 
Game: second baseman Rod Carew. On July 31, pitcher Bert Blyleven gave 
up two inside-the-park home runs, both to the Chicago White Sox Dick Allen. 
When this next occurs in the major leagues (October 4, 1986), Blyleven 
is again on the mound. But the feat is accomplished this time by his Minnesota 
teammate Greg Gagne. When César Tovar hit for the cycle on September 19, 
he finished with a game-ending home run. The only other player to do that 
in history was Ken Boyer (1961).[3] In later years, and after such a hit 
became known as a "walk-off home run", the feat was duplicated by George 
Brett (1979),[4] Dwight Evans (1984),[5] and Carlos González (2010). Tovar 
is just the second Twin to hit for the cycle, after Rod Carew in 1970; 
eight more Twins will do so by 2009. Carew won his second AL batting title 
with a .318 average. Bobby Darwin showed potential as a hitter with 22 
HR and 80 RBI, but that did not make up for age and injuries taking their 
toll on other players. (Those numbers were also suppressed by his Twins-record 
145 strikeouts.) Harmon Killebrew hit 26 HR (4th in the league) but drove 
in only 75 runs. Tony Oliva's bad knees limited him to only 10 games. César 
Tovar led the team with 86 runs scored. Four pitchers had double digit 
wins: Bert Blyleven (17-17), Dick Woodson (14-14), Jim Perry (13-16), and 
Jim Kaat (10-2). Kaat also won his 11th Gold Glove Award. 797,901 fans 
attended Twins games, the seventh highest total in the American League. 
It was almost half the number of fans that had attended just a few seasons 
earlier. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Infielders
