The 1937 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 56th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and the 46th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
81–73 during the season and finished 4th in the National League. At the 
start of January 1937, general manager Branch Rickey named Robert L. Finch 
vice president of all Cardinals minor league baseball teams.[1] Their star 
pitcher, Dizzy Dean, spent the preseason in a contract dispute, even threatening 
to quit baseball. He finally signed for an estimated $24,000 on March 19.[2] 
As the season was set to begin, the Cardinals were considered the favorites 
to win the National League and face the New York Yankees in the 1937 World 
Series.[3] Outfielder Joe Medwick won the MVP Award this year, batting 
.374, with 31 home runs and 154 RBIs. Conversely, Dizzy Dean battled injuries, 
staged a mid-game strike, engaged in multiple fights and was even suspended 
for a time. Dean finished with a 13–10 record and only one win after the 
All-Star Break and was named the "biggest bust of the year" by an Associated 
Press poll after the season.[2] The Cardinals started their season strongly, 
winning seven of their first eight games and jumping out to a 1½-game lead 
by the end of April. They were in second place as late as June 27, just 
half a game out of first place with a record of 35–24. However, they never 
rose any higher, spending the rest of the year in either third or fourth 
place, ending the season by losing six of eight and with their largest 
deficit of the year of 15 games out of first place.[4] [1] [2] [3] [4]
