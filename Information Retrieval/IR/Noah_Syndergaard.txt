Noah Seth Syndergaard (born August 29, 1992), nicknamed Thor (see below), 
is an American professional baseball pitcher for the New York Mets of Major 
League Baseball (MLB). Syndergaard made his MLB debut on May 12, 2015. 
Noah Syndergaard was born to Heidi, an Abbott Laboratories employee, and 
Brad Syndergaard, an "Iowa farmboy,", in Mansfield, Texas, outside of Fort 
Worth.[1] Brad has two other children by a prior marriage, but Noah is 
Heidi's only child.[1] Brad gave Noah valuable input at every level of 
his career and Noah has described his father as the best coach that he 
has ever had.[1] The Syndergaards, like many families in Texas, were "a 
football family" but Noah did not seriously play any sports other than 
baseball.[2][3] Syndergaard's mother encouraged her son to pursue baseball 
when he was a child.[2] He hit his first over-the-fence home run when he 
was seven years old.[1] Syndergaard grew up watching the Texas Rangers 
of Major League Baseball (MLB) and strongly disliking his family's favorite 
team, the NFL's Dallas Cowboys.[2] Syndergaard attended Mansfield Legacy 
High School in Mansfield, Texas. During his junior year of high school, 
Syndergaard experienced a growth spurt, growing by 3 to 4 inches (76 to 
102 mm) to reach 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m).[2] Syndergaard also began weight 
training, and his velocity improved greatly in his senior year at Mansfield, 
reaching 96 miles per hour (154 km/h).[2][4] However, his late development 
still caused him to be somewhat overlooked by talent evaluators.[5] After 
talking to coaches at the University of Oklahoma, the University of Nebraska, 
and Baylor University, he committed to attend Dallas Baptist University 
to play college baseball for the Dallas Baptist Patriots. Dallas Baptist 
was the only school that offered him a college baseball scholarship.[6][7] 
The Toronto Blue Jays selected Syndergaard in the first round, with the 
38th overall selection, of the 2010 MLB Draft.[4] He signed with the Blue 
Jays, receiving a $600,000 signing bonus to forego his commitment to Dallas 
Baptist.[8] In 2011, Syndergaard pitched for the Bluefield Blue Jays of 
the Rookie-level Appalachian League, the Vancouver Canadians of the Class 
A-Short Season Northwest League, and the Lansing Lugnuts of the Class A 
Midwest League. Before the 2012 season, MLB.com rated him as the 95th-best 
prospect in baseball.[9] He pitched alongside highly touted Blue Jays prospects 
Justin Nicolino and Aaron Sanchez in the minor leagues. The pitchers were 
together known as the "Vancouver Trio" and the "Lansing Trio" when they 
played for the Canadians and Lugnuts respectively.[5] He pitched for Lansing 
in 2012, and appeared in the Midwest League All-Star Game.[10] On December 
17, 2012, the Blue Jays traded Syndergaard, Travis d'Arnaud, John Buck 
and Wuilmer Becerra to the New York Mets for R.A. Dickey, Josh Thole and 
Mike Nickeas.[11] At the time of the trade, Syndergaard and d'Arnaud were 
two of the Blue Jays' top three prospects, and Dickey was the reigning 
winner of the Cy Young Award for the National League.[12] Entering his 
first season in the Mets organization, Syndergaard was rated as the team's 
third-best prospect, behind Zack Wheeler and d'Arnaud.[13] He began the 
2013 season with the St. Lucie Mets of the Class A-Advanced Florida State 
League (FSL), and was named an FSL All-Star.[14] He was promoted to the 
Binghamton Mets of the Class AA Eastern League in late June.[15] He was 
selected for the 2013 All-Star Futures Game.[16] In 2014, Syndergaard pitched 
for the Las Vegas 51s of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, where he had 
a 9–7 win–loss record, a 4.60 earned run average (ERA), and 145 strikeouts, 
which led the league. The Mets decided not to promote Syndergaard to the 
major leagues as part of its September call-ups.[17] Syndergaard began 
the 2015 season with Las Vegas, pitching to a 3–0 record with a 1.82 ERA.[18] 
Syndergaard made his major league debut for the Mets against the Chicago 
Cubs on May 12 at Wrigley Field in Chicago.[19] Syndergaard earned the 
loss as the Mets lost 6–1. He threw 103 pitches in five and one-thirds 
innings pitched while giving up 3 runs on six hits with six strikeouts 
and four walks. He earned his first strikeout against Cubs' leadoff hitter 
Dexter Fowler to start off his debut in the first inning.[20] On May 27, 
Syndergaard hit his first major league home run, a solo home run, off of 
Sean O'Sullivan of the Philadelphia Phillies. He had three hits in the 
game, tying a franchise record for pitchers with three hits in a game.[21][22] 
On July 10, he recorded a career-high 13 strikeouts in eight innings against 
the Arizona Diamondbacks, giving up one run, four hits and two walks and 
earning the win.[23] On August 3, he and Mets teammate Lucas Duda were 
named National League Co-Players of the Week for the week of July 27 to 
August 2.[24] In his first start during that week, on July 28, he pitched 
eight scoreless innings against the San Diego Padres, striking out nine 
and only issuing three hits and no walks on the way to a 4-0 Mets victory.[25] 
On August 2, Syndergaard again struck out nine over eight innings, surrendering 
two runs on seven hits and no walks in a victory over the Washington Nationals.[26][27] 
On August 8, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, Syndergaard became the 
first rookie since 1900 to win two consecutive starts with nine strikeouts 
and no walks in each start.[28] He finished his rookie season with a 9-7 
record and a 3.24 ERA in 24 starts, with the ability to throw his fastball 
at 100 miles per hour at times, he struck out 166 batters and gave up 31 
walks (2 intentional), 126 hits, 60 runs (54 of them earned), and 19 home 
runs in only 150 innings with a WHIP of 1.047. Syndergaard started in Game 
2 of the 2015 National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
He picked up the loss in that game as the Dodgers won 5-2, but he only 
allowed three runs in 6 1⁄3 innings pitched with nine strikeouts and four 
walks.[29] On October 15, he made his first Major League relief appearance 
in Game 5 . He pitched a scoreless seventh inning in that game, helping 
the Mets secure the victory and advance to the 2015 National League Championship 
Series (NLCS).[30] He started Game 2 of the NLCS and picked up the victory, 
giving up three hits, one run, and one walk while striking out nine in 
5 2⁄3 innings pitched.[31] The Mets swept the Cubs in four games and win 
the National League pennant, their first since 2000. Syndergaard started 
Game 3 of the 2015 World Series against the Kansas City Royals with the 
Mets already trailing 2 games to none in the series.[32] He got the victory 
in that game, allowing three runs, seven hits, two walks and striking out 
six in six innings as the Mets cruised to a 9-3 win.[33] It was the only 
game in the series that the Mets won, as the Royals went on to win in five 
games. Syndergaard made his season debut in the second game of the season, 
defeating the Royals at Kauffman Stadium on April 5.[34] On April 12, Syndergaard 
struck out 12 batters, obtaining 26 swings and misses, which was the most 
by a Mets pitcher in 15 years.[35] His 21 strikeouts in his first two starts 
of the season tied a club record along with Pedro Martínez and Dwight Gooden.[36] 
On April 18, Syndergaard made his third start of the season against the 
Phillies at Citizens Bank Park pitching for his second win of the year 
going seven innings allowing one run, five hits, two walks and struck out 
eight. Through his first three starts, Syndergaard is 2–0 with a 0.90 ERA, 
29 strikeouts and four walks in 20 innings.[37] With that he also has thrown 
at least eight strikeouts while allowing no more than one run in all three 
of his starts to begin a season in the last 100 years since Randy Johnson 
when he went four games with those stats in 1995.[38] With those numbers, 
he now ranks second in Mets history with the most strikeouts in first three 
starts of the season with twenty-nine surpassing Tom Seaver (1971 with 
28), Nolan Ryan (1970 with 28) and behind Pedro Martínez with thirty in 
2005.[39] On May 11, Syndergaard hit two home runs for his second and third 
career home runs off opposing Los Angeles Dodgers starter Kenta Maeda at 
Dodger Stadium. He became the first Mets pitcher to hit two home runs in 
a game since Walt Terrell did it on August 6, 1983 against Ferguson Jenkins 
of the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field in a 4–1 win. Both Terrell and Syndergaard 
are the only Mets pitchers to homer twice in the same game and drive in 
all four runs. Noah became the first pitcher to hit two home runs in one 
game since Micah Owings did it for the Arizona Diamondbacks on August 18, 
2007. Syndergaard's four RBI tied a Dodger Stadium single-game record for 
a pitcher since Lew Burdette of Milwaukee on July 10, 1958. Syndergaard 
pitched eight innings, allowed six hits, two runs and walked one while 
striking out six to win his first game since April 18.[40][41] For the 
second time in his career, Syndergaard was named the National League Player 
of the Week for the week of May 16–May 22. Syndergaard during the week 
went 2–0 with a 0.00 ERA with 21 strikeouts in 14 innings pitched.[42] 
On May 28, Syndergaard had his first career ejection when the umpire felt 
he intentionally threw a pitch behind the back of Chase Utley, which was 
considered retaliation for Utley injuring Ruben Tejada on a dirty slide 
in Game 2 of the 2015 NLDS[43] Syndergaard came back and continued to dominate 
in June, including coming two outs shy of what would have been his first 
career complete game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 15. However, 
in his last start of the month, Syndergaard pitched badly against his divisional 
rival Washington Nationals, as he went just three innings, allowing 5 runs 
on 7 hits and 3 walks. He also allowed 5 stolen bases, which led to the 
5 runs. The next day, on June 28, it was revealed that Syndergaard and 
teammate Steven Matz had pitching most of the season with bone spurs in 
the back of their pitching elbows. It was indicated that Syndergaard's 
spur was less significant and it will be treated with anti-inflammatory 
medication. Mets GM Sandy Alderson said that Syndergaard would not need 
to have the spur removed during the offseason. Syndergaard rebounded after 
his rough start in Washington with a brilliant outing on July 3 against 
the Chicago Cubs. He went 7 innings, allowing just one run, and struck 
out 8 batters. On July 5, he was named to the National League roster for 
the 2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Petco Park with fellow 
first time All-Star Jeurys Familia and Mets manager Terry Collins, but 
was later injured along with fellow teammate Yoenis Céspedes on July 8, 
forcing both to miss the game.[44][45] His spot on the roster would later 
be given to Drew Pomeranz of the San Diego Padres. He started the NL Wild 
Card game but his team came up short and lost 3-0. He ranked eighth in 
Cy Young voting, behind late pitcher Jose Fernandez of the Miami Marlins. 
PITCHf/x data shows him throwing a four-seam fastball at 95–99 miles per 
hour (153–159 km/h), while occasionally hitting 101 mph, along with a curveball 
between 77–82 miles per hour (124–132 km/h).[46] He also throws a circle 
changeup[47] and a slider. He added the slider to his repertoire during 
his first season in the majors. He initially began working with it to increase 
the spin on his curveball, saying in July 2015, "As of now, I’m just a 
fastball / curveball / changeup guy."[48] However, by that year's postseason, 
he was using the pitch with regularity, throwing 17 in his first playoff 
appearance.[49] On his mound presence, Syndergaard has said, "I feel like 
most people think I'm kind of this quiet guy, but when I'm on the mound 
... I try to be as intimidating as possible. I try to use that as a weapon 
of mine. I feel like I'm on top of the world when I'm on the mound."[50] 
Syndergaard is a weightlifting enthusiast and is capable of squatting 455 
pounds (206 kg) and deadlifting 512 pounds (232 kg).[2] After he shared 
a photo of himself weight training while dressed as the superhero Thor, 
due to the similarity between his last name and the fictional location 
Asgard, he acquired the nickname "Thor".[7][51] Syndergaard has embraced 
the nickname; his mother has an Australian Shepherd named Thor and Syndergaard 
has "Thor" stitched into one of his gloves.[1] Syndergaard has taken to 
naming all of his gloves after fictional characters. He has previously 
used gloves named "Drago" (after the Rocky IV character), "Heisenberg" 
(after the alias of a Breaking Bad character) and "Rick Grimes" (after 
the The Walking Dead character).[1] Syndergaard auctions his gloves off 
in order to raise money for the Sjögren's Syndrome Foundation, which raises 
money to fight Sjögren's disease, an autoimmune disease from which his
