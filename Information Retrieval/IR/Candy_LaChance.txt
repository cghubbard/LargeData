George Joseph LaChance (February 14, 1870 – August 18, 1932) was a first 
baseman who played in Major League Baseball between 1893 and 1905. LaChance 
was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. He was born in Putnam, Connecticut. 
LaChance reached the majors in 1893, spending six years with the Brooklyn 
Grooms & Bridegrooms before moving to the Baltimore Orioles (1899), Cleveland 
Blues (1901) and Boston Americans (1902–05). He hit .300 or more five times, 
and from 1894 to 1899 averaged 25.67 stolen bases each year, with a career-high 
37 in 1895. In that season he also led the National League hitters with 
108 RBI, while hitting .312 with 38 extra-bases and 99 runs. While in Boston 
in 1903, he was a member of the first World Champion team in major league 
history. In a 12-season career, LaChance was a .280 hitter (1377-for-4919) 
with 39 home runs and 690 RBI in 1263 games, including 678 runs, 197 doubles, 
86 triples and 192 stolen bases. Later he played with Montreal and Providence 
in the International League and for Waterbury and New Haven in the Connecticut
