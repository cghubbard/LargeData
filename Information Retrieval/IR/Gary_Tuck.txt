As Coach Gary Robert Tuck (born September 6, 1954) is an American professional 
baseball former player and coach. He has coached in Minor League Baseball 
and in Major League Baseball for the New York Yankees, Florida Marlins, 
and Boston Red Sox. A graduate of Indiana University,[1] Tuck has 23 years 
of professional coaching experience. He started his baseball career as 
a catcher for the Montreal Expos organization and played for them during 
three minor league seasons. Following his playing retirement, he served 
as an assistant coach at the University of Notre Dame in 1980, and Arizona 
State University in 1981. After winning an NCAA championship with Arizona 
State, Tuck was hired to coach for the nearby Tucson Toros, a Minor League 
affiliate of the Houston Astros. Tuck spent eight years in the Astros organization. 
In 1986 he managed the Double-A Columbus Astros to a league championship,[2] 
winning Southern League Manager of the Year honors. By 1989, Tuck was a 
coach on the New York Yankees Triple-A team, the Columbus Clippers.[3] 
In 1991 he was the manager of the Cleveland Indians Single-A team, a job 
he held before switching to a Scout for the Indians from 1992–1995. He 
would rejoin the Yankees again in 1996 as the manager of the Single-A Oneonta 
Yankees, where he spent the next two seasons.[4] With the Yankees, Tuck 
served as the bullpen coach under managers Bucky Dent and Stump Merrill. 
Following the season, Merrill was named permanent manager, and Tuck was 
not retained. Tuck worked with Jorge Posada as a young player, and prepped 
him to eventually take over for starting catcher Joe Girardi. Posada's 
workload increased from 60 games in 1997 to 111 and 112 the next two seasons.[5] 
He eventually took over the starting role in 2000. Tuck won World Series 
rings as the team catching instructor in 1998 and 1999.[6] He was not retained 
following the 1999 season. Tuck returned to the Yankees prior to the 2003 
season and spent the next two years as catching instructor. The team defeated 
the Red Sox in the 2003 American League Championship Series, and lost to 
them in the 2004 American League Championship Series.[7] He spent the 2005 
season out of baseball. In 2006, Joe Girardi was hired as the Marlins manager, 
and he hired Tuck as his bench coach. He was known for writing the lineup 
card in calligraphy [1]. Girardi was fired following the season despite 
winning Manager of the Year. In November 2006, the Boston Red Sox hired 
Tuck as their new bullpen coach.[1] He joined pitching coach John Farrell 
and hitting coach Dave Magadan as new members of the Red Sox coaching staff 
for the 2007 season. He earned another World Series ring as a member of 
Boston's 2007 championship team. Tuck also served as an organization-wide 
catching instructor during spring training.[1] The Red Sox won the 2007 
World Series with Tuck on the coaching staff. He spent six years with the 
Boston Red Sox. However, in his final season, he was noted for clashing 
with manager Bobby Valentine.[8] On January 29, 2013, he notified the Red 
Sox that he intended to retire effective immediately.[9] He spent the 2013 
season out of baseball. Tuck rejoined the Yankees as their bullpen coach 
during the 2013–14 offseason.[10] The team moved from the ninth best bullpen 
in 2013, to eighth best under Tuck.[11][12] Despite the bullpen's success, 
the Yankees missed the postseason for their second consecutive year. Following 
the 2015 season, Tuck declined his contract option and left the Yankees.
