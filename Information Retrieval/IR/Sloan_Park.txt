Sloan Park is a baseball park in Mesa, Arizona which opened in 2014. The 
primary operator is the Chicago Cubs and the ballpark serves as their spring 
training home and is also the home of the Arizona League Cubs of the Arizona 
League and the Mesa Solar Sox of the Arizona Fall League. Sloan Park was 
built and paid for by residents of the City of Mesa, approved by ballot 
measure. It was primarily built to house spring training operations for 
the Chicago Cubs, who had previously played at nearby Hohokam Stadium.[3] 
The stadium design was led by Populous, and Lloyd Civil & Sports Engineers 
provided the stadium and practice fields design. With a capacity of 15,000, 
Sloan Park is the largest spring training stadium by capacity in Major 
League Baseball, surpassing Camelback Ranch in Glendale (coincidentally, 
spring training home of the Cubs' in-city rival the Chicago White Sox) 
by 2,000 seats.[4] Formerly known as Cubs Park, on January 8, 2015, it 
was announced that Sloan Valve Company had signed a naming-rights deal
