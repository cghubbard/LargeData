Charlie Robertson's perfect game was a Major League Baseball game that 
took place on April 30, 1922, between the Chicago White Sox and Detroit 
Tigers. Robertson, pitching for the White Sox, retired all 27 batters he 
faced to pitch a perfect game. Robertson was the White Sox's starting pitcher 
for their game against the Tigers in Detroit on Sunday, April 30, 1922. 
The 26-year-old Robertson, who had played for the American Association's 
Minneapolis Millers the previous season, was making his fourth start in 
Major League Baseball.[1] He faced a Detroit team that ended the season 
with a .306 batting average.[1] Robertson started off the game by striking 
out Lu Blue. In the second inning, Chicago's Harry Hooper and Johnny Mostil 
scored on a Whitey Sheely single for the only runs. A spectacular diving 
catch by Johnny Mostil on a liner to left by Bobby Veach in the second 
inning preserved the historic feat.[1] Throughout the game, Tigers manager 
Ty Cobb complained to the umpires that Robertson was doctoring the ball. 
Robertson's uniform was checked, and Detroit kept several game balls, but 
nothing was ever found. In the ninth inning, Robertson retired pinch hitter 
Johnny Bassler for the final out.[1] The game lasted one hour and 55 minutes.[2] 
It was 34 years before anyone else pitched a perfect game in the majors. 
For White Sox catcher Ray Schalk, it was one of four no-hitters he caught

and a 3.64 earned run average. He finished his career with a win-loss record 
of 49–80 and a 4.44 ERA, and according to one writer, "Hands down, Robertson
