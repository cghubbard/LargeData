The Wright State Raiders are the athletics teams of Wright State University 
in Dayton, Ohio. The school currently participates in fifteen sports at 
the Division I level of the NCAA, and are members of the Horizon League. 
The school's mascot is a wolf. Wright State was founded in 1964 as a branch 
campus of both Miami University and Ohio State University. The school began 
its athletic program in 1968 as a NCAA Division II school, where the athletics 
program achieved great success, having over 200 All-American athletes and 
winning the 1983 Division II Men's Basketball national championship. In 
1987, Wright State began the transition to Division I athletics, with its 
first tournament qualifier being a golfer in 1988. In swimming, the school 
spent time in the Penn-Ohio Conference. From 1991 to 1994 the school was 
a member of the Mid-Continent Conference (now known as the Summit League) 
before moving in 1994 to the Midwestern Collegiate Conference (now known 
as the Horizon League). Since joining the Horizon, several teams have won 
conference titles, many athletes have been named to all-conference teams, 
and several coaches have won Coach of the Year honors.[2] Among the Raiders' 
most notable athletic achievements are the NCAA Division II men's basketball 
national championship in 1983, and taking a turn at March Madness in 1993, 
qualifying for the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as champion 
of the Mid-Continent Conference; the Raiders qualified again in 2007 as 
winner of the Horizon League tournament. The men's and women's swimming 
and diving teams are also consistently strong. The men have won 6 of the 
last 13 conference championships. For many years, Wright State's sports 
teams used a character called Rowdy Raider as their mascot; a red-bearded 
Viking with a horned helmet, which emerged in 1986, a role played by Andrew 
"Legend" Winchek Jr. In 1997, the Viking was retired and the Wolf was born. 
In 2007, Rowdy Raider received a new update for the mascot suit; a gray, 
scarier wolf replaced the more humorous brown wolf.[citation needed] Wright

The Wright State men's basketball team has seen the national spotlight 
several times since the program moved to Division I in 1987-88 and into 
the new Nutter Center in 1990. In 1993, the Raiders qualified for the NCAA 
Tournament, and since then Wright State is 5-1 all-time at home vs Top 
25 competition. In 1995, Wright State defeated #25 Xavier, 71-70, their 
first ever home win over a Top 25 opponent. In the 1999-2000 season, Wright 
State beat #6 Michigan State at the Nutter Center, 53-49. On February 10, 
2007 Wright State welcomed their Horizon League rival and ninth-ranked 
Butler Bulldogs to Dayton. In an impressive showing that would lead the 
Raiders to be named ESPN.com's "Team of the Week", Wright State dominated 
No. 9 Butler, 77-65.[4] The Bulldogs returned to Dayton for the 2007 Horizon 
League tournament final, where Wright State again beat No. 17 Butler (by 
a score of 60-55) to earn a berth in its second-ever NCAA Tournament. DaShaun 
Wood, the Horizon League Player of the Year, led Wright State with 27 points 
and 5 assists.[5] Wright State continued its streak the following season, 
defeating #13 Butler, 43-42.[6] The women's basketball program at Wright 
State University began in the 1973-74 season. It saw its first winning 
season two years later, earning a 9-8 record under the direction of coach 
Arnelle Jackson. In 2014 Wright State won its first Horizon League tournament 
championship to earn a berth to the NCAA tournament for the first time 
under coach Mike Bradbury. The Raiders have appeared in two postseason 
tournaments playing in the Women's Basketball Invitational in 2010 and 
2011. The Raiders currently play their home games in the Nutter Center.
