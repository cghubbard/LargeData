The St. Louis Cardinals 1981 season was the team's 100th season in St. 
Louis, Missouri and the 90th season in the National League. 1981 was a 
season of two significant anomalies: A change in the playoff format, which 
created the first-ever Divisional Series with a qualification variant that 
existed only for that season, and the players' strike, which truncated 
the regular season. Despite finishing 59-43, good for the best overall 
record in the National League East, the strike set up the scenario where 
the Cardinals actually missed the playoffs. The regular season was split 
into halves to tally teams' records separately in each half of the season, 
and because the Cardinals finished in second place in each half, they did 
not qualify for the 1981 playoffs. Major League Baseball reverted to the 
previous playoff format the following season, and the Cardinals qualified 
for that postseason. First baseman Keith Hernandez won a Gold Glove this 
year. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games
