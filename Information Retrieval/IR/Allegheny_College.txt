Allegheny College is a private, coeducational liberal arts college in northwestern 
Pennsylvania in the town of Meadville, approximately 35 miles (56 km) south 
of Erie.[5] Founded in 1815, Allegheny is the oldest college in continuous 
existence under the same name west of the Allegheny Mountains.[6] Allegheny 
is a member of the Great Lakes Colleges Association and the North Coast 
Athletic Conference and it is regionally accredited by the Middle States 
Commission on Higher Education. Allegheny was founded in April 1815[7][8] 
by the Reverend Timothy Alden, a graduate of Harvard's School of Divinity. 
The college was historically affiliated with the United Methodist Church 
after 1833, although it is currently non-sectarian. The first class, consisting 
of four male students, began their studies on July 4, 1816, without any 
formal academic buildings. Within six years, Alden accumulated sufficient 
funds to begin building a campus. The first building erected, the library, 
was designed by Alden himself, and is a notable example of early American 
architecture. Bentley Hall is named in honor of Dr. William Bentley, who 
donated his private library to the College, a collection of considerable 
value and significance. In 1824, Thomas Jefferson wrote to Alden, expressing 
the hope that his University of Virginia could someday possess the richness 
of Allegheny's library.[9] Alden served as president of the college until 
1831, when financial and enrollment difficulties forced his resignation. 
Ruter Hall was built in 1853.[10] Allegheny began admitting women in 1870,[11] 
early for a US college; a woman was valedictorian of the Allegheny class 
of 1875.[11] One source suggests that Ida Tarbell, the pioneering journalist 
who exposed the predatory practices of Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company, 
was the first woman to attend Allegheny.[12] In 1905, Allegheny built Alden 
Hall as a new and improved preparatory school.[7] Over the decades, the 
college has grown in size and significance while still maintaining ties 
to the community. In 1971 the film Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to 
Me based on the Richard Farina novel was filmed on college grounds.[13][14] 
While the word "Allegheny" is a brand for the college, it is also the name 
of a county, a river, and a mountain range, and the school has tried to 
prevent other entities from using this word. For example, Allegheny objected 
in 2006 when Penn State tried to rename one of its campuses "Allegheny".[15][16] 
Allegheny president Richard Cook said 'Allegheny' was "our brand."[15] 
It sued the Philadelphia's Allegheny Health and Research Foundation in 
1997 to change its name.[17] Under president Richard J. Cook, Allegheny 
was reported to have had a "stronger endowment, optimal enrollment, record 
retention rates, innovative new programs and many physical campus improvements."[18] 
These years were marked by tremendous growth in the endowment, marked by 
a $115-million fund-raising drive, bringing the endowment to $150 million.[19][20] 
In February 2008, James H. Mullen Jr. was named the 21st president of Allegheny. 
He took office Aug. 1, 2008.[21] The college and the town cooperate in 
many ways. One study suggested the Allegheny College generates approximately 
$93 million annually into Meadville and the local economy.[22] Since 2002, 
Allegheny hosts classical music festivals during the summer.[23] In October 
2006, the college attracted negative publicity after local enforcement 
cited over 100 people for underage drinking at a college party.[24] In 
July 2007, a 1,500-pound wrecking ball demolishing part of Allegheny's 
Pelletier Library broke its chain, rumbled down the hill, careened "back 
and forth across the street," hit nine parked cars, wrecked curbs, and 
crashed into the trunk of an Allegheny student's car, pushing his car into 
two cars in front of him.[25][26] Eight soccer balls in his car "likely 
lessened the impact of the wrecking ball," and possibly spared his life, 
according to a police officer on the scene.[25][27] The student body voted 
to name the library's coffee shop "The Wrecking Ball" after the event. 
The college has sponsored panels on unusual topics such as face transplants 
(2009).[28] Allegheny professors have joined highly visible initiatives; 
for example, Allegheny professor Michael Maniates, described as the "nation's 
leading authority on the politics of consumption," joined the board of 
a project about the twenty-minute film The Story of Stuff by filmmaker 
Annie Leonard, and generated headlines.[29] Dr. Maniates said "We really 
need to think of ways of making it possible for people to think about working 
less and getting by on less."[30] At present, environmental concerns are 
important at Allegheny, which in 2008 worked with Siemens to devise a "total 
energy use reduction plan" for the college.[31] The campus has 40 principal 
buildings on a 79-acre (32 ha) central campus, a 203-acre (0.82 km2) outdoor 
recreational complex, and a 283-acre (115 ha) nature reserve and protected 
forest.[32] There were 4,324 applications for admission to the class of 
2019 (enrolling fall 2015): 2,955 were admitted (68.3%) and 492 enrolled 
(an admissions yield of 16.6%).[46] The average high school GPA of enrolled 
freshmen was 3.69, and 47% had a high school GPA of 3.75 or higher.[46] 
The middle 50% range of enrolled freshmen on SAT scores was 503–630 for 
reading, 510-620 for math, and 480-618 for writing, while the ACT Composite 
middle 50% range was 22–29.[46] U.S. News & World Report ranked Allegheny 
as tied for 72nd among liberal arts colleges, and tied for 6th "most innovative 
school" in the United States for 2016.[50] Washington Monthly, which rates 
schools based on the degree to which they "contribute to the public good" 
by improving social mobility, producing research and promoting service, 
ranked Allegheny 30th among liberal arts colleges in 2016. In 2012, The 
Daily Beast ranked Allegheny as the nation's 20th most academically-rigorous 
school.[51] The Princeton Review ranked Allegheny among the top 353 green 
colleges in the United States and Canada in its 2015 Guide to Green Colleges.[52] 
Similarly, the Sierra Club rated Allegheny as 66th among "America's Coolest 
Schools," [53] recognizing it for its green initiatives. Tuition and fees 
for the 2013–2014 year total $37,610; room and board is $9,540.[32] In 
2011–2012, 86 percent of applicants for financial aid received aid; the 
average financial aid award was $31,716.[54] US News reported that as of 
2012–13, 70.8 percent of all full-time Allegheny undergraduates receive 
some form of need-based financial aid, and the average award is $22,848.[55] 
Parents of incoming first-year students are advised by the college to complete 
the Free Application for Federal Student Aid or FAFSA; Allegheny's school 
code is 003230.[56] Different scholarships are available as well as loan 
options.[56] It is possible for parents to pay in ten equal installments.[57] 
Allegheny uses inducements such as scholarships and discounts to attract 
students.[58] Many "merit aid" discounts are offered regardless of ability 
to pay.[58] Extensive merit aid is available up to $80,000 for four years 
of study.[32] A report in 2006 suggested that 78% of Allegheny graduates 
would carry debt averaging at $24,825.[59] Humanities include Art, Communication 
Arts, Dance and Movement Studies, English, Modern and Classical Languages 
(includes Chinese, French, German, Latin, and Spanish), Music, Philosophy 
and Religious Studies.[60] Natural Sciences include Biochemistry, Biology, 
Chemistry, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Geology, Mathematics, 
Neuroscience, Physics.[60] Social Sciences include Economics, Environmental 
Studies, History, International Studies, Political Science, Psychology.[60] 
Minor courses of study are offered in the above disciplines, and also include: 
American Studies, Arts and the Environment, Asian Studies, Black Studies, 
Classical Studies, Chinese Language, Chinese Studies, Dance and Movement 
Studies, French Studies, German Studies, Lesbian and Gay Studies, Latin 
American and Caribbean Studies, Media Studies, Medieval and Renaissance 
Studies, Science, Health and Society, Russia and Eastern Europe, and Values, 
Ethics and Social Action. Allegheny also offers opportunities for students 
to design their own majors and minors. Students may also choose to double-major 
or double-minor if they have sufficient credits. Allegheny is accredited 
by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE).[8] About 30% 
of the school's 2,100 students graduate in one of the "STEM" disciplines—science, 
technology, engineering, and math.[61] Allegheny does not have any Reserve 
Officer Training Programs or ROTC, for Air Force, Army or Navy.[62] The 
student to faculty ratio was 13 to 1. There were approximately 162 active 
faculty members (not counting adjunct faculty or faculty emeriti) in 2008.[33] 
Allegheny's academic calendar is divided into two 15-week semesters. The 
school year typically runs from the last week of August to mid-May, with 
a short fall break in mid-October, a Wednesday-to-Sunday Thanksgiving break, 
a month-long winter break from mid-December to mid-January, and a week-long 
spring break in the third week of March.[63] Allegheny requires students 
to choose a minor as well as a major[64] and encourages "unusual combinations" 
of majors and minors.[64] A student's major can be in the humanities, social 
sciences or natural sciences, but that student's minor must be in a different 
division than his or her major.[61][64] A reporter explained: "a student 
enrolled in a humanities major such as English, art, or religious studies, 
would still take 20 to 24 credits – five to six courses – of science-related 
study if they decided to pick their minor within the natural sciences division ... 
Even if they don't, they still are required to pick two courses from within 
the natural science areas. One of those science courses must be a lab class."[61] 
The interdisciplinary approach is reflected in how graduates have fared 
with their careers. For example, Kathleen Harrill earned degrees in music 
and psychology at Allegheny, and used them to become a music therapist 
to help autistic children; her 300-page thesis on music and healing won 
recognition.[65] Another graduate studied both English and bioethics at 
Allegheny, and became a lawyer at Bayer corporation helping to work on 
ethics and compliance issues.[66] One student who wanted to become a special 
education teacher found a new love of documentary filmmaking after majoring 
in communication arts; her senior film "Finding Matty's Voice" won the 
Best Documentary and Grand Jury prizes at the Ivy Film Festival at Brown 
University in 2008.[67] There is some debate at Allegheny about requiring 
scientific-related coursework and whether there should be an emphasis on 
"scientific literacy".[61] Allegheny students must complete a minimum of 
36 semester credit hours of coursework in their major with an average grade 
of 2.0.[68] Satisfactory completion of a minor requires completion of 20 
credits of coursework with a minimum grade average of 2.0.[68] In addition, 
students must take at least two courses (8 semester credit hours) in a 
discipline other than their major or minor.[68] Total credits for graduation 
are 128 semester credit hours, and no more than 64 credit hours can be 
from any one department.[68] Almost all courses carry four semester hours 
of credit.[60] All students are required to take a three-seminar series 
which "encourages careful listening and reading, thoughtful speaking and 
writing, and reflective academic planning and self-exploration," to be 
completed in their first two years.[69] Sophomores typically meet with 
faculty advisers eight times a year.[70] Allegheny seniors are required 
to complete a senior project in their major.[68] Some senior projects can 
be quite ambitious; in 2007, one senior project involved comprehensive 
instructions for installing solar panels on the roof of a campus building.[71] 
Allegheny offers direct enrollment programs at Lancaster University, England; 
James Cook University, Australia; University of Natal, South Africa; Capital 
Normal University, China; and Karls-Eberhard University, Germany.[5] It 
offers language and area studies programs in Seville, Spain; Angers, France; 
Karls-Eberhard University, Germany; and Querétaro, Mexico.[5] It offers 
internship programs in London, England; Paris, France; and Washington D.C.[5] 
Programs geared to specific majors are also available, including environmental 
studies at the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, Israel; and the 
Center for Sustainable Development, Costa Rica; marine biology at the Duke 
University Marine Lab in North Carolina; and political science at American 
University.[5] Allegheny faculty members have led domestic summer-study 
tours to New York, Yellowstone, Austria, Costa Rica, and South Africa.[5] 
Individually arranged study abroad has taken students to Argentina, Canada 
(Nova Scotia), China, Cuba, Greece, Italy, Mexico, and Scotland.[5] Allegheny 
has medical school cooperative programs available with three institutions: 
Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Drexel University[72] and 
Jefferson Medical College. Allegheny offers pre-professional programs in 
law and health.[33] It has an arrangement with Drexel University College 
of Medicine to admit two Allegheny students who meet specific criteria 
(grades, MCAT scores).[33] It has an arrangement with the William E. Simon 
School of Business Administration at the University of Rochester to have 
preferred admission to selected students by the end of their junior year.[33][70] 
Allegheny offers cooperative 3–2 liberal arts/professional programs in 
engineering with Case Western Reserve University, Columbia University, 
the University of Pittsburgh, and Washington University.[5] There is also 
a 3–2 Master of Information Systems Management (MISM) program reciprocal 
agreement with Carnegie Mellon University. Four faculty won Fulbright awards 
in March 2001.[73] Faculty sometimes focus on the local area; for example, 
economics professor Stephen Onyeiwu conducted a study of manufacturing 
in the northwestern Pennsylvania region.[74] Ninety percent of faculty 
have terminal degrees in their respective fields.[5] Books by faculty include 
Congressional Women and Comedy from Shakespeare to Sheridan.[5] A literary 
prize was won by Allegheny writing instructor Kirk Nesset for his collection 
"Paradise Road" in 2007.[75] Faculty actively publish on a wide range of 
subjects from the biology of woodpeckers,[76] to structural features of 
ribosomal RNA,[77] to freshwater invertebrates.[78] Students generally 
are required to live on campus for all four years, and may reside in traditional 
dormitories, apartment-style housing, or college-owned houses.[32] The 
demographics of students as of fall 2015 were: White (non-Hispanic) 75.9%,; 
Hispanic/Latino 7.0%, Black (non-Hispanic) 5.9%; Two or more races 4.7%, 
Non-resident alien 2.8%, Asian & Pacific Islander 2.4%; American Indian 
or Alaskan native 0.1%; Unknown 1.2% .[3] Allegheny students in 2008 come 
from 33 states and 25 other countries.[5] Allegheny had a "diversity index" 
of .15 on a scale of .99=extremely diverse to .01=not diverse.[79] Students 
participate in volunteer activities: in the fall semester of 2011, the 
student body contributed 25,000 hours of volunteer service to the community.[80] 
Some Allegheny students volunteered to help restore businesses in hurricane-ravished 
New Orleans.[81] Residence halls and classrooms are closed during summers.[33] 
An Allegheny Student Government has an active role in formulating college 
policy, curriculum choices, personal conduct, promoting cultural programs, 
and making decisions about the school's calendar.[5] Information about 
students is generally kept private in keeping with the 1974 "Family Educational 
Rights and Privacy Act" which prohibits colleges from releasing information 
about their students without student permission.[82] Accordingly, parents 
can not learn about their son's or daughter's grades unless a waiver is 
signed permitting release of such information. The privacy policy can sometimes 
lead to problems, particularly when students have mental health problems 
but the school is prevented legally from contacting parents. In 2002, one 
Allegheny student committed suicide, and his parents sued the school; a 
jury in 2006 found that the school was not liable or negligent.[82] This 
case helped focus national attention on the competing issues of student 
privacy and parental rights.[83] Campus security includes 24-hour foot 
and vehicle patrols, late night escort service, lighted pathways and sidewalks, 
controlled residence hall access, and 24-hour emergency telephones.[62] 
Health service is offered.[62] Despite proximity to the snowbelt, snow 
rarely shuts down the town of Meadville or the college.[84] Official college 
policy is to discourage underage (less than 21 years) drinking, although 
there have been incidents of violations at off-campus parties.[85] Incoming 
students are required to take an online course about the dangers of alcohol 
abuse.[85] The school punishes transgressions with disciplinary action.[85] 
Students run a campus radio station WARC 90.3 FM and a publication called 
"The Allegheny Review" of undergraduate literature.[86] The college hosts 
outside speakers.[87] Allegheny has numerous student groups and organizations 
such as an astronomy club, a College Choir, an Outing Club, and a Peace 
Coalition.[88] There are over 100 clubs and organizations offered at Allegheny.[5] 
The Allegheny newspaper is called The Campus. It is distributed weekly 
at locations all over the college. It covers campus news, features, opinion 
and a wrap-up of the college sports. The Campus is entirely student-run, 
with an editorial board of students in charge of making all executive decisions 
for the publication. The Allegheny alternative magazine is called Overkill. 
It is tri-semester student publication distributed in unconventional locations 
around campus, such as in vending machines, fireplaces, and chandeliers. 
It features student editorials, poetry, non-fiction and fiction pieces, 
art, and photography with a highly distinctive design and attitude. Allegheny 
has welcomed a variety of entertainers and guest speakers over the last 
several years including John Updike, Dave Matthews, Dick Cheney,[89] Bill 
Clinton,[90] W.D. Snodgrass, Adam Sandler, George Carlin, The Vienna Choir 
Boys, Rusted Root, Ben Folds, The Roots, Stephen Lynch, The Fray, Jimmy 
Fallon,[91] and comedian Wayne Brady.[92] There have been "live" art shows 
in which invited artists, over an eight-hour period, created 10-by-10-foot 
"drawings" on gallery walls while spectators watched.[93] Allegheny, known 
athletically as the Gators, belongs to the North Coast Athletic Conference 
and has NCAA Division III teams.[94] Men's sports are baseball,[95] basketball,[96][97] 
cross country, football,[98] golf, soccer,[99] swimming and diving, tennis,[100] 
and track & field.[94][101][102] Women's sports are basketball,[96][97] 
cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer,[99] softball, swimming & diving, 
tennis,[100] track & field,[102] and volleyball.[94] Sports facilities 
include the Wise Center and the Robertson Complex.[103] 75 percent of students 
play intramural sports.[5] The 1990 Allegheny football team, led by first-year 
head coach (and current Miami Dolphins assistant) Ken O'Keefe, won the 
Division III football national championship 21–14 over Lycoming College. 
One tradition is that a female student is not a "real co-ed" until she's 
been kissed on the thirteenth plank of the Rustic bridge over the stream.[104][105] 
Legend states that there is a competition among residence halls during 
Orientation Week to steal the thirteenth plank and display it, though this 
rarely happens today;[106] random students take the plank instead, with 
maintenance keeping a supply of replacement planks on hand.[104] Allegheny 
College also has a number of fraternities and sororities on campus. These 
include Kappa Kappa Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Delta Delta Delta, Alpha 
Delta Pi, and Alpha Chi Omega for the sororities. In 2009, 34% of Allegheny 
women belonged to a sorority.[107] The fraternities on campus include Theta 
Chi, Phi Kappa Psi, Delta Tau Delta, and Phi Delta Theta. In the Fall of 
2012, the Pi Chapter of Phi Gamma Delta was reestablished at Allegheny 
College. Allegheny is located in northwestern Pennsylvania 90 miles (140 km) 
north of Pittsburgh, 90 miles (140 km) east of Cleveland, and 35 miles 
(56 km) south of Erie, in the town of Meadville, Pennsylvania.[5] The school's 
main address is 520 North Main Street, Meadville, PA 16335.[5] The phone 
number is (814) 332–3100.[5] Allegheny is located near Interstate 79; in 
addition, there is bus service to nearby cities such as Cleveland, Erie, 
and Pittsburgh.[5] In fiscal year 2007, Allegheny had revenues from tuition 
and fees of $33,149,074, government grants and contracts of $1,091,068, 
private gifts grants and contracts of $8,925,845 and an investment return 
of $31,748,504, and other core revenues of $1,040,120.[108] Expenses included 
instruction $19,442,708, research $966,394, academic support $6,040,548, 
student service $2,029,686, and institution support $9,766,374.[108] There 
are approximately 150 administration and staff personnel in 2008.[33] The 
president since August 2008 is James H. Mullen Jr.[33] The staff breakdown 
is as follows: 157 full-time employees doing instruction, research, and 
public service; 43 executive, administrative, and managerial personnel; 
103 other professionals (support/service); 9 technical and paraprofessionals; 
68 clerical and secretarial employees; 12 skilled craftspersons; and 27 
service & maintenance staff.[108] In addition, part-time staff included 
36 instructors, 23 other professionals, 10 secretaries, and 4 service and 
maintenance staff.[108] Of the 157 full-time faculty, 87 have tenure, and 
41 are on a tenure track.[108] The average salaries of professors (in 2007) 
was $83K, associate professors was $63K, assistant professors was $51K, 
instructors was $38K.[108] Allegheny is a member of the Higher Education 
Data Sharing Consortium, or HEDS, in which member institutions share information 
relating to improvement of higher education.[109] Coordinates: 41°38′59″N
