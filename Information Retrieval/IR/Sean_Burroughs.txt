on his show that he wanted to be a gynecologist when he grew up.[citation

in the Little League World Series (Ching-Hui Huang of 1973 Tainan, Taiwan

game as the Tainan Team did not allow a hit in the entire LLWS).[2] The 
San Diego Padres selected Burroughs in the first round, with the ninth

the San Diego Padres major league team in 2002. Burroughs hit a game-winning 
single in the first game played at San Diego's Petco Park and a near-division 
clinching double off San Francisco's Armando Benítez in 2005.[citation
