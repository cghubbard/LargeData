As player As manager George Irvin Bamberger (August 1, 1923 – April 4, 
2004) was an American professional baseball player, pitching coach and 
manager. In Major League Baseball, the right-handed pitcher appeared in 
ten games, nine in relief, for the 1951–52 New York Giants and the 1959 
Baltimore Orioles. He later spent ten seasons (1968–77) as the Orioles' 
pitching coach and managed the Milwaukee Brewers (1978–80; 1985–86) and 
New York Mets (1982–83). Bamberger was born and raised in Staten Island, 
New York. He served in the United States Army during World War II in the 
Mediterranean and European theaters of operations[1] and signed with the 
Giants in 1946. Bamberger reached double digits in wins during four of 
his first five minor league seasons; he would record ten or more victories 
in 15 of his 18 years as a minor league pitcher, and win 213 total games 
during that span (1946–63). Bamberger made the MLB Giants' 28-man roster 
at the outset of the 1951 season. In his big-league debut on April 19, 
1951, during a Patriots' Day doubleheader against the Boston Braves at 
Braves Field, he gave up three hits (including a home run to Sam Jethroe) 
and two earned runs in two innings pitched.[2] Nine days later, he struggled 
again, as he surrendered a base on balls and then a two-run homer to Jackie 
Robinson, while recording no outs, against the Brooklyn Dodgers.[3] Bamberger 
spent the rest of that season with the Triple-A Ottawa Giants of the International 
League. In 1952, Bamberger again was a member of the big-league Giants 
during the season's early weeks. He appeared in five more games, all as 
a relief pitcher, but was largely ineffective, allowing six hits, three 
walks and four earned runs in four full innings of work. After June 1, 
he was sent to the Oakland Oaks of the top-level Pacific Coast League, 
where he spent the bulk of the rest of his playing career. The Oaks transferred 
to Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1956, and Bamberger remained with the 
renamed Vancouver Mounties for another seven years until the franchise 
moved again, to Dallas, Texas, in 1963. In the midst of that tenure, however, 
in 1959, the 35-year-old Bamberger received his third and final Major League 
trial with the Mounties' parent club, the Baltimore Orioles. In his American 
League debut April 16, Bamberger was the starting pitcher against the defending 
world champion New York Yankees at Memorial Stadium. He held the Yankees 
scoreless for five full innings, as Baltimore built a 2–0 lead. But in 
the sixth, he surrendered a two-run double to Norm Siebern, tying the game, 
and then, after the Orioles had gone ahead, 3–2, in their half of the sixth, 
gave up the lead in the seventh frame. He left after 6⅓ innings, allowing 
four earned runs on four hits, with Baltimore trailing by a run. (The Orioles 
eventually prevailed, 7–4, with Billy O'Dell getting the win in relief.)[4] 
After two relief appearances with the Orioles, Bamberger returned to the 
Pacific Coast League for the rest of his pitching career. He never recorded 
a decision in the Majors, and compiled a 9.42 ERA with 25 hits and ten 
bases on balls allowed, and only three strikeouts, over 14⅓ innings. In 
1960–63, Bamberger served as a player-coach for the Mounties and Dallas-Fort 
Worth Rangers while still pitching regularly (working in 135 games, 110 
as a starter). Then, in 1964, he retired as a player and rejoined the Baltimore 
organization as its roving minor league pitching instructor. The Orioles' 
farm system was then among the pioneers in standardizing player instruction. 
With Bamberger playing a key role, it was developing a corps of young pitchers 
that would help the club win the 1966 World Series. He earned a promotion 
when general manager Harry Dalton appointed him to succeed Harry Brecheen 
as the Orioles' pitching coach on October 3, 1967.[5] Serving under Hank 
Bauer and then Earl Weaver, Bamberger would remain with the ballclub through 
1977 and five American League East Division championships, three American 
League pennants and the 1970 World Series championship. During that decade, 
he produced 18 twenty-game winners, including four for the 1971 American 
League champions: Jim Palmer, Mike Cuellar, Dave McNally and Pat Dobson. 
He also would teach his famed pitch, "The Staten Island Sinker". After 
the 1977 season, Dalton became general manager of the Milwaukee Brewers. 
In their nine-year history, including 1969 as the Seattle Pilots, the Brewers 
had never had a winning record, nor had they won more than 76 games. Seeking 
a replacement for dismissed manager Alex Grammas, Dalton hired the 54-year-old 
Bamberger as Milwaukee's 1978 pilot. In his first managerial assignment, 
Bamberger led the 1978 Brewers to a 26-game turnaround. His club won 93 
games and finished third behind the Yankees and Boston Red Sox in the AL 
East. Bamberger's influence on his pitching staff was reflected by a 30 
percent decrease in walks allowed (566 vs. 398) and a 20 percent decline 
in home runs allowed (136 vs. 109). Team ERA dropped from 4.32 to 3.65, 
and both Mike Caldwell (22–9, 2.36) and Lary Sorensen (18–12, 3.21) enjoyed 
standout seasons. But a spike in offense would make an even larger mark 
on Bamberger's team. The 1978 Brewers hit 173 home runs (48 more than in 
1977) and outscored their previous year's team by 165 runs, a 26 percent 
rise. Seven players hit double figures in home runs, and two (Larry Hisle, 
signed as a free agent, and Gorman Thomas) eclipsed the 30-homer mark. 
The Brewers became known as "Bambi's Bombers."[6] Then, in 1979, Bamberger's 
Brewers hit 185 home runs, captured 95 victories and finished second, behind 
only Weaver's Orioles. But in March 1980, during spring training, Bamberger 
was hospitalized with back and chest pains. He was diagnosed with a heart 
attack, underwent surgery and was sidelined until June 6. He re-took the 
reins from interim pilot Buck Rodgers, but did not finish the season, resigning 
September 7 after compiling a disappointing 47–45 win-loss record. He stepped 
down with a 235–180 (.566) mark for his maiden managerial job, while turning 
Milwaukee into a contender for the American League pennant. The Brewers 
qualified for the playoffs in 1981 under Rodgers and won their only AL 
championship in 1982 with Harvey Kuenn at the helm. (The club moved to 
the National League Central Division in 1998.) Bamberger's managerial career 
was not over, however. Frank Cashen, another former Oriole executive, hired 
him as skipper of the struggling New York Mets for 1982. The Mets had gone 
only 41–62 (.398) under Joe Torre during the strike-shortened 1981 season. 
The 1982 Mets—still in the early stages of a rebuilding process that would 
produce the 1986 world championship—played at almost an identical pace 
(.401), led the National League in bases on balls and finished second-worst 
in team ERA. Then the 1983 edition started even worse. They were 16–30 
(.348) on June 3 when Bamberger resigned, saying, "I've probably suffered 
enough."[7] A season and a half later, during the 1984–85 off-season, Dalton 
called Bamberger back into harness to attempt to revive the Brewers, who 
had plunged into the AL East basement in 1984. But this time, Bamberger 
was unable to turn the club around: they won only 71 games for him in 1985 
(with the team ERA climbing by 0.33 to 4.39) and 71 more the following 
season. The bright spot on the Brewers' staff was left-handed starting 
pitcher Teddy Higuera, who won 15 games as a rookie in 1985 and 20 more 
the following season. Bamberger retired for a final time September 25, 
1986, at age 63, turning the Brewers over to coach Tom Trebelhorn with 
nine games left in the season. He finished his managerial career with a 
record of 458–478 (.489). George Bamberger died on April 4, 2004, from 
cancer at his home in North Redington Beach, Florida. He was 80 years old.
