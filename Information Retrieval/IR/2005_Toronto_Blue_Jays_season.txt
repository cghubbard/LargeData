The 2005 Toronto Blue Jays season was the franchise's twenty-ninth season 
of Major League Baseball. It resulted in the Blue Jays finishing third 
in the American League East with a record of 80 wins and 82 losses. This 
was the first 162-game season since 1993 that Blue Jays hitters would combine 
for less than 1,000 strikeouts. On February 2, 2005, several days after 
finalizing the purchase of SkyDome by Rogers Communications, Rogers renamed 
the stadium to the Rogers Centre. In spite of the best efforts of the new 
ownership, a wide majority of Blue Jays fans continued (and still continue) 
to refer to the stadium as SkyDome. By the start of the season, Rogers 
had upgraded the stadium with a new "JumboTron" videoboard and added other 
state-of-the-art video screens around the stadium. Furthermore, the AstroTurf 
surface was replaced by the more natural-looking FieldTurf. Owner Ted Rogers 
also promised a payroll increase to $210 million over the next three years, 
which allowed the team to have a team payroll of $70 million per year. 
The Blue Jays finished spring training with a 16–10 record. Among the stars 
of spring training was Gabe Gross, who tied the Jays' record for most home 
runs in spring training with eight (the previous record breaker was long 
time Blue Jay Carlos Delgado). The Jays were able to translate their success 
in spring training into an excellent start—the team led the AL East from 
early to mid-April and held their record around .500 until late August. 
The Jays were hit with the injury bug when third baseman Corey Koskie broke 
his finger, taking him out of the lineup, but the club was pleasantly surprised 
with the performance of rookie call-up Aaron Hill in his stead. On July 
8, just prior to the All-Star break, Blue Jays ace Roy Halladay was struck 
on the shin by a line drive from Texas left fielder Kevin Mench and was 
placed on the DL with a fractured leg. The injury cost Halladay his chance 
to be the American League starter in the All-Star Game in Detroit; his 
place on the All-Star squad was taken by Red Sox pitcher Matt Clement. 
Though Halladay's injury was hoped to be minor, the recovery process was 
met with constant delays, and Halladay eventually would prove to be out 
for the rest of the season. Team management officially announced that he 
would miss the rest of the season in August. The Halladay injury is seen 
by many as the negative turning point in the Jays season; the team had 
been in serious wild card contention at the time, but afterwards fell out 
of the race and failed to make the playoffs for the 12th consecutive year. 
On July 22, Toronto traded utility infielder John McDonald to the Detroit 
Tigers for cash considerations. This gave the Blue Jays an open spot on 
the roster so that Aaron Hill could stay with the team when Corey Koskie 
returned from injury. On July 28, Toronto played in the longest game in 
franchise history, innings-wise, an 18-inning marathon against the Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim at Rogers Centre. The Jays won 2–1, after nearly 
five hours of play when Orlando Hudson hit a line drive past a drawn in 
infield, scoring Alex Ríos from third base. The shutdown of Halladay for 
the remainder of the season seemed to affect the performance of the Jays. 
They went on a slump that brought their record under .500 in the beginning 
of September. From there, the Blue Jays finished the season 80–82 while 
receiving glimpses of the future from September call-ups Guillermo Quiróz, 
John-Ford Griffin, and Shaun Marcum. Marcum made himself noteworthy by 
posting an ERA of 0.00 over 5 relief appearances and 8 innings in September. 
Griffin hit his first career home run in the last game of the season and 
ended up going 4 for 13. Josh Towers also stepped up, showing largely unseen 
potential going 7–5 with a 2.91 ERA in the 2nd half of the year and a 13–12, 
3.71 ERA season overall, making him arguably the unlikely ace of the Jays 
rotation with Halladay injured and Gustavo Chacín faltering somewhat after 
the All-Star break. The 2005 Jays inability to score with men in scoring 
position was a turning point in many games that ended up as losses, also 
contributing to the 80–82 record, although as a positive, the team did 
improve by 13 wins and returned to their usual 80-win plateau. On October 
9, the Jays, along with their fans, mourned the loss of inaugural broadcaster 
Tom Cheek. Cheek, 66, succumbed to brain cancer after just over a year-long 
battle. Cheek had broadcast 4,306 consecutive games since the first day 
of the franchise. His streak was ended in June 2004 when he took time off 
to visit his ailing father. In the off-season, general manager J. P. Ricciardi 
began to make good use of the money that had been granted to the Jays by 
Rogers Communications before the season. Rogers had given Ricciardi $210 
million over three years, which became $75 million a season to spend, $25 
million more than the previous year. Ricciardi fulfilled the team's need 
for a stable closer by signing former Baltimore Orioles standout B. J. 
Ryan to the richest contract ever for a reliever – a 5-year, $47 million 
on November 28. Following that, the club awarded a 5-year, $55 million 
contract to highly coveted starting pitcher A. J. Burnett, formerly of 
the Florida Marlins, on December 6. On December 23, 2005, Rogers Sportsnet 
reported that the Jays added a much needed 30 plus home run hitter to their 
lineup by getting third baseman and 2002 World Series MVP Troy Glaus and 
minor league shortstop Sergio Santos in a trade with the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
In return, the Diamondbacks received second baseman and 2005 Gold Glove 
Award winner Orlando Hudson and pitcher Miguel Batista. Glaus passed a 
team physical on December 26, and the trade was officially announced the 
next day. On the same day as the announcement of the Glaus deal, the Jays 
acquired solid-hitting first baseman Lyle Overbay and right-handed pitching 
prospect Ty Taubenheim in a trade with the Milwaukee Brewers; with pitcher 
Dave Bush, pitching prospect Zach Jackson, and outfielder Gabe Gross going 
to Milwaukee. Glaus and Overbay were both introduced to the Toronto media 
together a few days later. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]
