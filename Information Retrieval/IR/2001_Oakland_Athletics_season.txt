The Oakland Athletics' 2001 season was the team's 34th in Oakland, California, 
and the 101st season in franchise history. The team finished second in 
the American League West with a record of 102-60. The Athletics entered 
the 2001 season with high expectations. Much of the excitement stemmed 
from the team's trio of promising young starting pitchers (Barry Zito, 
Mark Mulder, and Tim Hudson); after a strong showing in 2000, many expected 
the Athletics' rotation to rank among the American League's best in 2001. 
The signing of additional starter Cory Lidle during the 2000-01 offseason 
helped solidify the rotation's back-end. On offense, the Athletics were 
loaded; sluggers Miguel Tejada, Eric Chavez, and reigning American League 
MVP Jason Giambi comprised the core of a powerful Oakland attack. The addition 
of Johnny Damon, acquired in a three-way trade for Ben Grieve, promised 
to add a new dimension to the Athletics' offense. A strong bullpen (led 
by Chad Bradford, Jim Mecir, and Jason Isringhausen) rounded out Oakland's 
roster. These high expectations quickly evaporated. The Athletics stumbled 
out of the gate (winning just two of their first dozen games); while their 
play nominally improved over the first half of the season, they failed 
to build upon the momentum of their division-winning 2000 campaign. The 
rival Seattle Mariners, in stark contrast, raced to a historic 52-14 start. 
As expected, the offense performed well; Oakland was instead hamstrung 
by unexpectedly terrible starting pitching. At the season's midpoint, the 
A's boasted a sub-.500 record (39-42); they trailed the division-leading 
Mariners by some 21 games. The Athletics responded with arguably the most 
dominant second half in modern MLB history. Over their final 81 regular 
season games, the A's went 63-18 (a record since the league switched to 
a 162-game schedule); this included 29 wins in their final 33 games. The 
Athletics' maligned rotation returned to form; over their final games, 
Zito, Mulder, Hudson, and Lidle went a combined 48-10. On July 25, the 
Athletics acquired slugger Jermaine Dye from the Kansas City Royals for 
prospects; this move further energized the already-surging squad. The Athletics 
ultimately weren't able to catch up with Seattle (which won an AL-record 
116 games), but their remarkable run allowed them to clinch the AL's Wild 
Card. The Athletics' 102 wins remain the most by a Wild Card team in MLB 
history. The Athletics faced the New York Yankees (the three-time defending 
World Series champions) in the ALDS. Oakland took the first two games, 
but unraveled after a heartbreaking 1-0 loss in Game 3; they would lose 
the series to the Yankees in five games. At the end of the season, Oakland 
would lose Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon, and Jason Isringhausen to free agency; 
this would set the stage for the events portrayed in Michael Lewis' bestselling 
book Moneyball (and the film by the same name). [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
