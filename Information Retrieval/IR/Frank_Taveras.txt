Franklin Crisostomo Taveras Fabian (born December 24, 1949), is a former 
Major League shortstop from 1971 to 1982 for the Pittsburgh Pirates, New 
York Mets and Montreal Expos. Taveras signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates 
as an amateur free agent January 8, 1968, and made his major league debut 
on September 25, 1971 as a pinch runner for Willie Stargell in the fifteenth 
inning of an extra inning marathon with the New York Mets (won 2-1 by the 
Mets in the bottom of the 15th). After only four appearances, mostly as 
a late inning defensive replacement in 1972, and spending the entire 1973 
season in the minors, Taveras made the Pirates for good in 1974. On August 
5, 1977, he hit an inside-the-park grand slam in the second inning of the 
second game of a doubleheader at Cincinnati. Eleven games into the 1979 
season, Taveras was traded to the New York Mets for Tim Foli and minor 
leaguer Greg Field on April 19. During his first season with the Mets, 
he hit his only career home run that actually went over the wall against 
Mike LaCoss. Coincidentally, it too was in Cincinnati. Taveras managed 
to play in 164 regular season games that year.[1] The Mets traded Taveras 
to the Montreal Expos for pitcher Steve Ratzer prior to the start of the 
1982 season. With Montreal, Taveras made his Major League debut as a second 
baseman. He was released on August 13 after compiling only a .161 batting
