The Cincinnati Reds are a professional baseball team based in Cincinnati. 
The Reds play in the Central Division of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 
National League (NL). In its 122 major league seasons, the franchise has 
won 5 World Series championships, tied for seventh most with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates.[1] The Reds played their home games at Riverfront Stadium from 
1970 to 2002 and at Crosley Field before that, from 1912 to 1970. In 2003, 
the team moved into Great American Ball Park, located on the banks of the 
Ohio River and built on the old site of Riverfront Stadium.[2] The history 
of the Cincinnati Reds dates back to 1876, where they were originally called 
the "Red Stockings" and were the first true professional baseball team 
in the United States.[3] The modern Cincinnati Reds began play in 1882 
as members of the American Association, which Reds won in their first year 
of competition.[4] The Reds joined Major League Baseball in 1890 and began 
their play in the National League. Over their history, the Reds have won 
10 National League Pennants and made it to the post season 13 times, along 
with their five World Series Championships.[5] Following the Cincinnati 
Reds second championship in 1940, the franchise only had one post-season 
appearance between 1941 and 1969.[5] During the 1970s, however, the Reds 
would appear in the post-season six times during the decade, along with 
four National League pennants, and back-to-back World Series championships 
in 1975 and 1976.[5][6] The Reds were nicknamed Big Red Machine during 
the time period and complied, what some have claimed to be, the best teams 
in major league baseball history.[7] Following the 1976 championship and 
Big Red Machine era, the Reds struggled to sustain consistent post-season 
appearances. The fifth and most recent championship for the Cincinnati 
Reds came in 1990, in which that team went wire-to-wire and swept the World 
Series.[3][8] The Reds have made two post-season appearances between 1991 
and 2011, with their most recent appearance coming in 2010. Overall, the 
Reds' have compiled a winning percentage of .508 over their history and 
also achieved a franchise mark of 10,000 wins on April 20, 2012, becoming 
just the sixth major league franchise to accomplish the feat.[9] The Reds 
lost their 10,000th game on August 28, 2015.[10] They were the fourth major 
league baseball franchise to reach this number. The following table describes
