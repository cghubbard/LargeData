Roberto Francisco Ávila González (April 2, 1924 – October 26, 2004) was 
a Mexican professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball 
as a second baseman for the Cleveland Indians (1949–58), Baltimore Orioles 
(1959), Boston Red Sox (1959), Milwaukee Braves (1959) and Tigres del México 
(1960). Born in Veracruz City, Mexico to Maria Gonzalez and Jorge Avila, 
he had a medium frame at 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) and 175 pounds (79 kg). He 
was better known in his homeland and other Latin American countries as 
"Beto" and in the majors as "Bobby". In 1954 Ávila won the American League 
Batting Championship, edging out Ted Williams and Minnie Miñoso with a 
.341 batting average, while playing almost the entire season with a broken 
thumb.Though by today's standards, Williams (with.345) would have been 
the champion, but he had so many walks (136), he didn't have enough official 
at bats to qualify. To keep this from happening again, the rule was changed 
shortly thereafter to plate appearances rather than official at bats to 
qualify as batting champion.[1] He also registered career highs in home 
runs (15), runs (112) and runs batted in (67).[2] In that same season, 
the Indians faced the New York Giants in the 1954 World Series, which matched 
the two leagues' champion bats, Ávila and Willie Mays; it was the third 
time that top batters in the majors played each other in the Series. Other 
matchups were Honus Wagner and Ty Cobb in 1909; Al Simmons and Chick Hafey 
in 1931. The next time the two batting champions faced off in the Series 
would be 2012, when the Giants' Buster Posey and Miguel Cabrera of the 
Detroit Tigers met.[3] Ávila was selected an All-Star in 1952, 1954 and 
1955; he was the American League's starting shortstop for the 1952 game. 
Avila led the league in triples in 1952, and led American League second 
basemen in fielding percentage in 1953. He also appeared in the MVP Award 
ballot in 1951 and 1954. An adept bunter and daring baserunner, his soccer 
training paid off several times when he intentionally kicked the ball out 
of defenders' mitts while sliding. Cleveland manager Al López said Ávila 
had "a fine swing, a sharp eye, a good spirit of competition ... and a 
world of confidence in himself."[4] In an 11-season career, Ávila hit .281 
with 80 homers, 467 RBI, 1296 hits, 725 runs, 185 doubles, 35 triples, 
and 78 stolen bases in 1300 games. Dealt three times in the last season 
of his career, he returned to Mexico in 1960 for one more season, batting 
.333 for the Tigres del México over 127 games before retiring as a player. 
After retiring he had a brief stint as a politician and served as mayor 
of his home city of Veracruz. When his tenure as mayor ended, he was elected 
president of the Mexican Baseball League. In an article in a 1976 issue 
of Esquire magazine,[1] sportswriter Harry Stein published an "All Time 
All-Star Argument Starter", consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Ávila, 
a Mexican, was the second baseman on Stein's Latin team. Beto Ávila is 
still widely recognized as the player who catalyzed the development of 
Mexican baseball, as Mexico's three previous MLB players had all grown 
up in Southern California.[citation needed] He died in his homeland of
