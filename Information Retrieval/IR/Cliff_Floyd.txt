Cornelius Clifford Floyd, Jr. (born December 5, 1972) is a former Major 
League Baseball left fielder, and is also currently a co-host on Sirius 
XM Radio. Floyd was born to parents Cornelius Clifford Floyd, Sr. and Olivia 
Floyd. After spending 13 years as an only child, Floyd was joined by brother 
Julius. Sister Shanta was later adopted when the Floyds noticed her as 
a six-year-old classmate of Julius' who had been troublesome for her then 
adoptive parents. The three siblings were raised in Markham, Illinois, 
a small suburb south west of Chicago. Floyd's father, a former Marine, 
worked double shifts at a U.S. Steel plant in Chicago to allow the family 
to live in a safe and stable neighborhood. At Thornwood High School in 
South Holland, Illinois, Floyd was a three-sport star in baseball, football, 
and basketball. In basketball, he led his high school to the Class AA Sectional 
Playoffs. In leading his team to the Illinois state baseball championship 
as a senior, he hit .508 with 130 RBI during the final two years of his 
high school prep career. He was heavily recruited by Arizona State University, 
Stanford, and Creighton University, but when the Montreal Expos drafted 
him as the 14th pick in the 1st round of the 1991 Major League Baseball 
draft, Floyd made no hesitation and chose to go to the minor leagues. Floyd 
made his major league debut in 1993, playing in 10 games with the Expos. 
In 1997, Floyd was traded from the Expos to the Florida Marlins for Dustin 
Hermanson and Joe Orsulak. In 1998, Floyd earned a starting position in 
the Marlins' outfield. In 2000, in 420 at-bats, he hit .300 with 22 home 
runs and 91 RBI. In 2002, Floyd was traded from the Marlins back to the 
Expos, with Claudio Vargas, Wilton Guerrero, and cash, for Graeme Lloyd, 
Mike Mordecai, Carl Pavano, Justin Wayne, and Donald Levinski. Later that 
year, Floyd was traded from the Expos to the Boston Red Sox for Sun-Woo 
Kim and Seung Song.[1] In 2003, Floyd was signed by the New York Mets. 
He played well for the Mets, but was hampered by injuries in 2003 and 2004. 
However, Floyd stayed healthy in 2005 and responded with a career-high 
and team-leading 34 home runs. The next year, though, Floyd was once again 
limited by injuries and only played in 97 games during New York's division-winning 
year. He caught the division-clinching out for the Mets, but was slowed 
by injuries in the playoffs for New York, only recording twelve at-bats 
in the his team's ten postseason games. In 2007, Floyd agreed to a deal 
with his hometown Chicago Cubs for the 2007 season, with an option for 
2008. Floyd missed nine games in August 2007 to mourn the death of his 
father, Cornelius. He returned on August 21, 2007, to play the San Francisco 
Giants, where he hit a game-winning RBI.[2] On December 14, 2007, Floyd 
signed a $3 million, one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Rays. Floyd spent 
2008 platooning for the Rays at DH against righties. On February 5, 2009, 
Floyd agreed to a one-year contract with the San Diego Padres.[3] On October 
8, 2009, the Padres released Floyd. On February 22, 2010, Floyd accepted 
a broadcasting job with Fox Sports Florida. Floyd also appears on NBC Sports 
Talk on the new NBC Sports Network and on MLB Network. Floyd made his debut 
in the broadcasting booth for FOX Sports Baseball Night in America on June 
21, 2014. In 2015, Floyd joined SportsNet New York where he would be an 
analyst for New York Mets games. On March 8, 2015, Floyd broadcast his 
first Mets game, a spring training game against the Boston Red Sox on WPIX-TV, 
with Gary Cohen doing play-by-play. Floyd lives in Florida with his longtime 
companion Maryanne Manning, the couple's two children, his mother, and 
the two children of his sister Shanta. Shanta died in 2006 after a long
