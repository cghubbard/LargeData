As player As manager As a general manager Fred Girard Haney (April 25, 
1896 – November 9, 1977) was an American third baseman, manager, coach 
and executive in Major League Baseball (MLB). As a manager, he won two 
pennants and a world championship with the Milwaukee Braves and, as an 
executive, he was the first general manager of the expansion Los Angeles 
Angels of the American League. For years, Haney was one of the most popular 
baseball figures in Los Angeles. In 1974 he was presented with the King 
of Baseball award given by Minor League Baseball. Born in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, and raised in Los Angeles, Haney's major league playing career 
lasted all or part of seven seasons (1922–27, 1929). Primarily a third 
baseman—despite his diminutive (5 feet, 6 inches/1.67 m) size—Haney compiled 
a .275 batting average for the Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox, Chicago 
Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals. Much of his playing career was spent in his 
hometown with the city's two Pacific Coast League clubs, the original PCL 
Angels and the Hollywood Stars. He threw and batted right-handed. Haney 
became a manager in 1936, piloting the Toledo Mud Hens of the AA American 
Association, the top farm team of the St. Louis Browns. In 1939, he took 
over the lowly Browns and the team lost 111 games. They improved by 24 
games in 1940, but when the 1941 Brownies dropped 32 of their first 44 
contests, Haney was replaced by Luke Sewell. After briefly returning to 
Toledo to manage through 1942, Haney went home to Los Angeles (and the 
Coast League) as the radio play-by-play broadcaster for the Hollywood Stars 
and Los Angeles Angels for six seasons, starting in 1943. In 1949, he moved 
back into the dugout as the manager of the Hollywood club. During his four 
years (1949–52) as manager, the Stars won two PCL pennants. As a reward, 
Haney was named manager of the Stars' parent club: the worst team in the 
National League, the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates rang up three last 
place finishes in Haney's 1953–55 tenure, losing 104, 101 and 94 games. 
Finally, he was given the pink slip by the Bucs, and he joined the Milwaukee 
Braves as a coach for 1956. Adversity turned into good fortune, however, 
when the Braves—slow out of the gate in '56—fired skipper Charlie Grimm 
on June 17 and turned to Haney. Milwaukee played at a .630 clip for the 
rest of the season and improved from fifth to second place, only one game 
behind the Brooklyn Dodgers, securing Haney's tenure in the Beer City. 
In 1957, with a lineup that included future Baseball Hall of Fame members 
Hank Aaron, Eddie Mathews, Warren Spahn, and Red Schoendienst – and stars 
such as Lew Burdette, Bob Buhl, Johnny Logan and Del Crandall – the Braves 
won the National League pennant by eight games over the St. Louis Cardinals. 
During the regular season, Haney led the Braves in overcoming season-ending 
injuries to star first baseman Joe Adcock and fleet center fielder Bill 
Bruton, and slow starts to the season by their starting left fielder and 
second baseman, both of whom were traded in mid-June for Schoendienst. 
Then, led by Burdette's three complete-game victories in the World Series, 
the Braves defeated the New York Yankees in seven games – including winning 
the crucial seventh game 5–0 in Yankee Stadium with Burdette pitching – 
thus making him the World Series Most Valuable Player. Aaron received the 
National League Most Valuable Player award and Spahn won the lone Major 
League Cy Young Award (two Cy Young Awards were not given out per year 
until 1967). In 1958, the Milwaukee Braves repeated as the National League 
champions, this time again by a margin of eight games. (This time, it was 
a victory over Haney's old friends in Pittsburgh, back in contention under 
their manager Danny Murtaugh). The core of the Braves team was once again 
Aaron, Matthews, Adcock, Spahn, and Burdette; and Bruton come back from 
his season-ending injury in 1957 to play in 100 games. Logan played a full 
season with 145 games. Aaron led the team with 196 hits, 109 runs scored, 
and 95 runs batted in, and Matthews led the team with 31 home runs. However, 
in 1958 their starting pitcher Bob Buhl was injured after pitching in just 
11 games, winning five, and that put even more pressure on Haney, Spahn, 
and Burdette to win. Also because of injuries, Adcock played in only 105 
games, and Wes Covington played in just 90. Schoendienst played in just 
106 games, including some as just a pinch hitter, and it was discovered 
the next year that he had tuberculosis. In that difficult situation, Haney 
managed Spahn to a 22–11 record in 290 innings pitched and 23 complete 
games, and Burdette to a 20–10 record in 275 innings. The Braves finished 
first in the National League with a 92–62 record and returned to the World 
Series. The Yankees again won the American League, hence the two teams 
faced off against each other again in the World Series. The Braves roared 
ahead by winning three of the first four games for a 3–1 lead in the series. 
However, the Yankees then regrouped, and they won games five, six, and 
seven to win the World Championship, with the final two games being played 
in Milwaukee County Stadium, the Braves' home stadium. In 1959, the Milwaukee 
Braves were back in the thick of contention again, with the same core of 
regular players, and a stronger pitching staff, since Buhl came back to 
pitch 200 innings in 31 games, with a 15–9 record. Spahn and Burdette both 
shone, each with a 21–15 record, 290 innings pitched, and a combined total 
of 41 complete games. Adcock played in 115 games, Bruton played in 133, 
and Aaron and Matthews had incredible seasons.[according to whom?] Aaron 
led the league with careers highs in 223 hits, a 0.355 batting average, 
and 400 total bases, and he also led the league in slugging percentage. 
Aaron also hit 39 home runs and had 123 runs batted in. However, Matthews 
led the team with 46 home runs, and batted in 114 runs. On the minus side 
of the equation, second baseman Schoendienst played in only five games 
and then went into a long but successful treatment for tuberculosis, and 
outfielder Wes Covington played in just 105 games. Still, Haney managed 
the Braves to an end-of-the-season tie with the Los Angeles Dodgers for 
first place, with records of 86 wins and 68 losses. This forced the two 
teams into a best-two-out-of-three-games playoff. The Dodgers, who had 
lost playoffs for the pennant in both 1946 and 1951, were not to be denied 
in 1959. The Dodgers swept the first two games of the playoff, and they 
won their first pennant in their new home city – Haney's hometown of Los 
Angeles. A few days later, Haney, approaching the age of 61, was dismissed 
as the manager of the Braves, and he was replaced by the former Dodger 
coach Chuck Dressen. In his guide to baseball managers, author Bill James 
makes a detailed case for considering Haney's 1959 season at the helm of 
the Braves as the worst performance by an MLB manager. As he puts it: "Without 
exaggeration, the 1959 Dodgers shouldn't have been within 20 games of the 
Braves". In reality, the two teams ended up playing a three-game playoff, 
which the Dodgers swept in two games. Among Haney's mistakes that season: 
riding his two top pitchers, Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette into the ground 
while ignoring a number of talented youngsters who were available to pitch; 
platooning Joe Adcock with the awful Frank Torre long after Torre had demonstrated 
he was in a year-long slump; failing to settle on a solution when 2B Red 
Schoendienst was lost for the season; and loading his bench with a group 
of grumpy and over-the-hill veterans from which he failed to get any production. 
Thus, during his tenure of a little more than three-and-one-half seasons, 
Haney led the only two pennant winners, and the only World Champion, during 
the 13-year existence (1953–65) of the Milwaukee Braves. With his other 
two clubs "near misses", Haney stands as by far the most successful manager 
of the Braves' years in Milwaukee. Harvey's career managing record — tarnished 
by his poor teams in St. Louis and Pittsburgh — was 629–757 (.454). However, 
with the Braves, he won 341 games and lost 231 (.596). Haney was not out 
of work long. In 1960 he made a brief return to broadcasting, teaming with 
Lindsey Nelson to call weekend baseball for NBC television. The following 
year, the American League granted an expansion team to Los Angeles, the 
Los Angeles Angels, and its owner, Gene Autry, chose Haney to operate the 
team and its organization for him. While the Angels usually struggled on 
the playing field during Haney's tenure as GM from 1961 to 1968, they did 
finish a surprising third in 1962, and contended for the 1967 pennant as 
well. Haney made the team competitive in its early years by selecting future 
stars such as the shortstop Jim Fregosi and the pitcher Dean Chance in 
the expansion draft, and acquiring sluggers such as Leon Wagner and Lee 
Thomas. Haney also oversaw the Angels' relocation in 1966 from Chavez Ravine 
down the freeway to Anaheim Stadium in Orange County. Upon his retirement 
at the end of the 1968 baseball season, Haney became a part-time consultant 
for the California Angels, and he was succeeded as the team's general manager 
by Dick Walsh. Haney died of a heart attack on November 9, 1977, at age
