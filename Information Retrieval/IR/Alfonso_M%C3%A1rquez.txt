Alfonso Márquez (born April 12, 1972) is an umpire in Major League Baseball 
who has worked in the National League in 1999 and throughout both major 
leagues since 2000.[1] While a minor league umpire, Márquez served as an 
instructor at the Brinkman/Froemming Umpire School.[2] He has officiated 
three World Series (2006, 2011, 2015), three American League Championship 
Series (2003, 2008, 2013), and six Division Series (2001, 2002, 2005, 2006, 
2011, 2012, 2015), as well as the 2006 All-Star Game. The first Mexican-born 
umpire in major league history, he resides in Gilbert, Arizona. Graduated 
from Fullerton Union High School in Orange County, California in 1990. 
[3] Márquez wears the uniform number 72.[3] He was at second base on August 
7, 2004 for Greg Maddux's 300th win.[4] For the 2009 season, Márquez was 
assigned to Randy Marsh's Crew P along with Mike Winters and Lance Barksdale. 
For the 2011 season, Márquez was assigned to a crew with Ed Rapuano, Brian 
O'Nora, and Ed Hickox. For the 2016 season, Márquez was assigned to a crew 
with Larry Vanover along with Chris Guccione and David Rackley. On July 
2, 2011, Márquez ejected both Toronto Blue Jays manager John Farrell and 
Jon Rauch. After a single from Philadelphia Phillies 2B Chase Utley scored 
on a single from CF Shane Victorino; however, it appeared that Rauch was 
angered previous to the play, relating to Márquez's strike zone, as it 
was fairly apparent that Utley did appear to be safe. After the game, Rauch 
was quoted as saying: "First thing I told the umpire is it's a shame he 
doesn't have an ERA because those [fourth and fifth] runs are his." The 
Phillies ultimately won the game by that score, 5-3.[5] This ejection gained 
notoriety because of the size of Rauch and his anger towards Márquez. Rauch, 
being 6'11" and weighing well over 250 pounds, had to be restrained by 
catcher J.P. Arencibia, Farrell, and third base coach Brian Butterfield. 
In the process, Rauch's jersey was ripped off and Farrell's jaw was dislocated
