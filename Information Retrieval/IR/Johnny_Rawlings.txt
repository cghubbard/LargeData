John William Rawlings [Red] (August 17, 1892 – October 16, 1972) was a 
second baseman and shortstop in Major League Baseball who played for six 
different teams between the 1914 and 1926 seasons. Listed at 5 ft 8 in 
(1.73 m), 158 lb., he batted and threw right-handed. A native of Bloomfield, 
Iowa, Rawlings attended high school in Los Angeles. He started his professional 
career in 1911 with the Vernon Tigers of the Pacific Coast League. Rawlings 
entered the majors in 1914 with the Cincinnati Reds, appearing for them 
in 33 games before jumping during the mid-season to the Kansas City Packers 
of the outlaw Federal League. After one and a half seasons in Kansas City, 
he spent 1917 with the Toledo Iron Men of the American Association. Rawlings 
returned to major league action with the Boston Braves (1917-'20), and 
later played for the Philadelphia Phillies (1920-'21), New York Giants 
(1921-'22) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1923-'26). His most productive season 
came in 1921 for Phillies and Giants, when he posted career-numbers in 
hits (156), runs (60), extrabases (27), RBI (46) and games played (146), 
while hitting a respectable .278 average. In 1922 he hit .282 in 82 games, 
good enough to play for John McGraw's National League pennant winning Giants 
in 1921 and 1922. He hit .333 (10-for-30) with three doubles and four RBI 
for the 1921 Giants World Series champions. Of particular note was the 
last play in the series, the last time a best-of-nine game format was used. 
With the Giants winning in the 9th inning and the Yankees facing elimination, 
Yankees manager Miller Huggins sent Babe Ruth in to pinch hit to lead off 
the inning. Ruth had knee and elbow injuries and had missed Games 6 and 
7 completely, and hat sat out Game 8 thus far. He grounded out to the first 
baseman unassisted. Aaron Ward coaxed a walk, and represented the tying 
run. The next batter was John Franklin "Home Run" Baker. After fouling 
off several pitches, he hit a ball that appeared to have eyes for right 
field. Ward took off on contact. Rawlings reached the ball, and after tumbling, 
threw to first base from his knees to get the out. Ward inexplicably continued 
running, rounded second base, and with his head down, barreled toward third. 
An astute throw to Frank Frisch at third base nailed Ward for the third 
out, and the Series was won by the Giants. Six seasons later, the winning 
pitcher, Art Nehf, then with the Cincinnati Reds, would call Rawlings snag 
the best play he had ever seen.[1] In all, Johnny Rawlings earned three 
World Series rings, though he did not play for the 1922 Giants and 1925 
Pirates series champions. During an early September game at Pittsburgh 
against the St. Louis Cardinals, Rawlings, now playing for the eventual 
World Champion Pirates, broke the fibula near the ankle in his left leg, 
while sliding into second base. The injury would keep him out of the World 
Series, and would cut short his major league playing career the following 
year. Following his major league career, Rawlings played in the minors 
until 1930. He began the 1930 season with the Pacific Electric ball club 
in Los Angeles, but by June, fate found him playing infield on the same 
Texas League Dallas Steers ball club with former Major League great Grover 
Cleveland Alexander, a future Baseball Hall of Famer. After he was released 
by the Steers in June, Rawlings signed on in July as a utility infielder 
with the Los Angeles Angels. From the 1940s Rawlings coached for a long 
time and also managed during eight years in the All-American Girls Professional 
Baseball League for the Grand Rapids Chicks (1946-'50), Peoria Redwings 
(1951) and Rockford Peaches (1953-'54). He led his teams to six playoff 
appearances, including a Championship Title with the 1947 Chicks. Johnny 
Rawlings was married to the former Alexia Selma Wieben (1894–1986) in Los 
Angeles, California on October 19, 1917. They had two daughters, Audrey 
(later Mrs. Jack Perry), who was born in 1922 in Pennsylvania, and Joanne 
(later Mrs. Jack Lynwood), who was born in 1927 in California. Shortly 
after his retirement from playing baseball, Johnny Rawlings was an insurance 
salesman in Los Angeles.[2] Rawlings died in Inglewood, California in 1972,
