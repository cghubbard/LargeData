Major League Baseball on the radio has been a tradition for almost 80 years,[1] 
and still exists today. Baseball was one of the first sports to be broadcast 
in the United States. Every team in Major League Baseball has a flagship 
station, and baseball is also broadcast on national radio. The first baseball 
game ever broadcast on radio was a Pittsburgh Pirates versus Philadelphia 
Phillies game on August 5, 1921. The game was broadcast by KDKA of Pittsburgh, 
and the Pirates defeated the Phillies 8-5. It was broadcast by KDKA staff 
announcer Harold Arlin.[2][3][4][5][6][1] That year, KDKA and WJZ of Newark 
broadcast the first World Series on the radio, with Grantland Rice and 
Tommy Cowan calling the games for KDKA and WJZ, respectively.[3][4][5] 
However, the broadcasters were not actually present at the game, but simply 
gave reports from a telegraph wire.[3] The next year, WJZ broadcast the 
entire series, with Rice doing play-by-play.[4][5] For the 1923 World Series, 
Rice was joined on Westinghouse for the first time by Graham McNamee.[3][7] 
During the 1923 World Series, Rice was the main broadcaster, but during 
the fourth inning of Game 3, he turned the microphone over to McNamee.[5][7] 
This was the start of McNamee's career, and McNamee became the first color 
commentator.[8] Although frequently criticized for his lack of expertise, 
McNamee helped popularize baseball.[3][7][9][10] Many owners were still 
wary. By the 1930s, the two-team cities of Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis, 
and Chicago had reached an agreement not to broadcast away games. In other 
words, if the Boston Braves were at home, listeners could hear that game 
on the radio, but could not listen to the Boston Red Sox away game. The 
owners' argument-"they won't come to the park if you give the game away"-was 
invalidated under this arrangement. The New York owners went one step further: 
in 1932 they agreed to ban all radio broadcasting-even of visitors' re-creations-from 
their parks. Larry MacPhail took over the Cincinnati Reds in 1933 and sold 
a controlling interest in the club to Powel Crosley, owner of two Cincinnati 
radio stations. It was a match made in economic heaven: MacPhail knew that 
broadcasting games would promote the team and Crosley could now boost his 
radio ratings. Their symbiosis is reminiscent of St. Louis beer-garden 
magnate Chris von der Ahe's takeover of the St. Louis team in order to 
sell more beer. When MacPhail moved to Brooklyn in 1938, he brought Reds 
announcer Red Barber with him and broke the New York radio ban. The next 
year was the first year that all the major league teams broadcast their 
games. Prophetically, it was also the year of the first televised baseball 
game. In 1935, Baseball Commissioner Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis orchestrated 
a radio deal that covered the World Series. All three networks were involved, 
and baseball made US$400,000. Landis, as ever, was imperious; he dismissed 
Ted Husing as games announcer despite the fact that, with five World Series, 
Husing was second only to the ubiquitous Graham McNamee in Series-announcing 
experience. The amount of money involved in baseball broadcasting was growing. 
Gillette, the razor blade manufacturer and one of the first companies to 
realize the power of sports as an advertising vehicle, tried to flex its 
muscles by offering Red Barber a substantial amount to walk out on his 
Dodger contract and join Gillette on a new Yankees/Giants network. Barber 
refused. It's no wonder Gillette felt powerful; in 1946 the company was 
rich enough to sign a 10-year, $14-million deal for exclusive radio sponsorship 
of the World Series and All-Star Games. Though radio grew quickly as a 
medium for baseball, many teams were still apprehensive about it, fearing 
negative effects on attendance. Nevertheless, each team was allowed to 
reach its own policy by 1932,[5] and the Chicago Cubs broadcast all of 
their games on WMAQ in 1935.[3][11][12] The last holdouts were the New 
York teams—the Giants, Dodgers, and Yankees combined to block radio broadcasts 
of their games until 1938.[3][5] By the end of this period, radio had become 
increasingly commercialized. Wheaties started its long relationship with 
baseball in 1933,[13] and in 1934, sponsorship rights to the World Series 
were first sold.[14][15] During the Golden Age of Radio, television sports 
broadcasting was in its infancy, and radio was still the main form of broadcasting 
baseball.[12] Many notable broadcasters, such as Mel Allen, Red Barber, 
Harry Caray, Russ Hodges, Ernie Harwell, and Vin Scully, started in this 
period. However, broadcasting still did not look like the way it does today—recreations 
of games based on telegrams, the original means of broadcasting, were still 
widely used.[16] The Liberty Broadcasting System operated solely through 
recreations of games, because live games were too expensive.[17] Gordon 
McLendon broadcast games throughout the South from 1948 until 1952, when 
new blackout regulations forced him to stop.[14][18][19] The Mutual Broadcasting 
System also broadcast a Game of the Day in the 1950s.[14][20] However, 
as the Golden Era wound down, radio was gradually eclipsed by television.[12] 
The World Series continued to be broadcast on the radio, with NBC Radio 
covering the Series from 1960–1975, and CBS Radio from 1976–1997.[21] However, 
after Mutual's Game of the Day ended in 1960 there would not be regular-season 
baseball broadcast nationally on the radio until 1985, when CBS Radio started 
a Game of the Week.[22] In 1998, national radio broadcasts moved to ESPN 
Radio.[22] ESPN Radio currently broadcasts games on most weekends.[23] 
Starting with the 2005 season, MLB Home Plate was launched on XM Satellite 
Radio.[24] XM also carries every major league game.[25] Games are also 
carried on MLB Gameday Audio.[8] While all teams maintain a network of 
stations carrying their games in English, many teams also maintain a Spanish-language 
network as well. In addition, when the Washington Nationals were based 
in Montreal as the Montreal Expos, their games were broadcast in both English
