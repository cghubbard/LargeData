James Alvin "Jim" Palmer (born October 15, 1945) is a retired American 
right-handed pitcher who played all of his 19 years in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) with the Baltimore Orioles (1965–67, 1969–84) and was elected to 
the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990.[1] Palmer was the winning pitcher in 
186 games in the 1970s, the most wins in that decade by any MLB pitcher.[2] 
He also won at least twenty games in each of eight seasons and received 
three Cy Young Awards and four Gold Gloves during the decade. His 268 career 
victories are currently an Orioles record. A six-time American League (AL) 
All-Star,[3] he was also one of the rare pitchers who never allowed a grand 
slam in any major league contest.[4] Palmer appeared in the postseason 
eight times and was a vital member of three World Series Champions, six 
AL pennant winners and seven Eastern Division titleholders. He is the only 
pitcher in the history of the Fall Classic with a win in each of three 
decades. He is also the youngest to pitch a complete-game shutout in a 
World Series just nine days short of his 21st birthday in 1966.[5] He was 
one of the starters on the last rotation to feature four 20-game winners 
in a single season in 1971.[6] Since his retirement as an active player 
in 1984, Palmer has worked as a color commentator on telecasts of MLB games 
for ABC and ESPN and for the Orioles on Home Team Sports (HTS), Comcast 
SportsNet (CSN) Mid-Atlantic and the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN).[7] 
He has also been a popular spokesman, most famously for Jockey International 
for almost twenty years.[8] He was nicknamed Cakes in the 1960s because 
of his habit of eating pancakes for breakfast on the days he pitched.[9] 
Palmer was born in New York City. Shortly after his birth, Palmer was adopted 
by Moe Wiesen, a garment industry executive, and his wife Polly from Harrison, 
New York. After his adoptive father died in 1955, the nine-year-old Jim, 
his mother and his sister moved to California, where he began playing in 
youth-league baseball. In 1956, his mother married actor Max Palmer, from 
whom Jim Palmer took his last name. Showing talent at the amateur level, 
upon graduating from Arizona's Scottsdale High School in 1963, Palmer signed 
a minor-league contract at the age of 18. A high-kicking pitcher known 
for an exceptionally smooth delivery, Palmer picked up his first major-league 
win on May 16, 1965, beating the Yankees in relief at home. He hit the 
first of his three career major-league home runs, a two-run shot, in the 
fourth inning of that game off of Yankees starter Jim Bouton. Palmer finished 
the season with a 5–4 record. In 1966, Palmer joined the starting rotation. 
Baltimore won the pennant behind Frank Robinson's MVP and Triple Crown 
season. Palmer won his final game against the Kansas City Athletics to 
clinch the AL pennant. In Game 2 of that World Series at Dodger Stadium, 
he became the youngest pitcher (20 years, 11 months) to win a complete-game, 
World Series shutout, defeating the defending world champion Los Angeles 
Dodgers, 6-0. The underdog Orioles swept the series over a Los Angeles 
team that featured Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, and Claude Osteen. The shutout 
was part of a World Series record-setting 33 1⁄3 consecutive shutout innings 
by Orioles pitchers. The Dodgers' last run was against Moe Drabowsky in 
the third inning of Game 1. Palmer, Wally Bunker and Dave McNally pitched 
shutouts in the next three games. During the next two seasons, Palmer struggled 
with arm injuries. He threw just 49 innings in 1967 and was sent to minor-league 
rehabilitation. He regained his form after undergoing surgery, working 
in the 1968 Instructional League and playing winter baseball. He had been 
placed on waivers in September 1968 and was left unprotected for the Kansas 
City Royals and Seattle Pilots in the expansion draft one month later, 
but was not claimed.[10] In 1969, Palmer returned healthy, rejoining an 
Orioles rotation that included 20-game winners Dave McNally and Mike Cuellar. 
That August 13, Palmer threw a no-hitter against Oakland, just four days 
after coming off the disabled list. He finished the season with a mark 
of 16–4, 123 strikeouts, a 2.34 ERA, and .800 winning percentage. The heavily 
favored Orioles were beaten in the 1969 World Series by the New York Mets 
with Palmer taking the loss in Game 3. The Orioles won two more championships 
in the next two seasons. In 1970, Cuellar went 24–8, McNally 24–9, Palmer 
20–10; in 1971 the trio went 20–9, 21–5 and 20–9, respectively, with Pat 
Dobson going 20–8. Only one other team in MLB history, the 1920 Chicago 
White Sox, has had four 20-game winners. Palmer won 21 games in 1972, and 
went 22–9, 158, 2.40 in 1973, walking off with his first Cy Young Award. 
His success was interrupted in 1974 when he was downed for eight weeks 
with elbow problems. Palmer had lost seven games in a row by the time he 
went on the disabled list on June 20. He was diagnosed with an ulnar nerve 
injury and orthopedic surgeon Robert Kerlan prescribed rest, hot and cold 
water therapy and medication. Surgery was considered, but Palmer's pain 
lessened and he was able to return to play in August. He finished 7–12.[11] 
Again, Palmer was at his peak in 1975, winning 23 games, throwing 10 shutouts 
(allowing just 44 hits in those games), and fashioning a 2.09 ERA—all tops 
in the American League. He completed 25 games, even saved one, and limited 
opposing hitters to a .216 batting average. He won his second Cy Young 
Award, and repeated his feat in 1976 (22–13, 2.51). During the latter year, 
he won the first of four consecutive Gold Glove Awards. (Jim Kaat, who 
had won the award 14 years in a row, moved to the National League, where 
he won the award that year and in 1977.) In 1977–78, Palmer won 20 and 
21 games. During the period spanning 1970 to 1978, Palmer had won 20 games 
in every season except for 1974. During those eight 20-win seasons, he 
pitched between 274 1⁄3 and 319 innings per year, leading the league in 
innings pitched four times. During that span, he threw between 17 and 25 
complete games each year.[12] Over the next six seasons he was hampered 
by arm fatigue and myriad minor injuries. Even so, he brought a stabilizing 
veteran presence to the pitching staff. His final major-league victory 
was noteworthy: Pitching in relief of Mike Flanagan in the third game of 
the 1983 World Series, he faced the Phillies' celebrity-studded batting 
order and gave up no runs in a close Oriole win. The 17 years between his 
first World Series win in 1966 and the 1983 win is the longest period of 
time between first and last pitching victories in the World Series for 
an individual pitcher in major league history. He also became the only 
pitcher in major league baseball history to have won World Series games 
in three decades. Also, he became the only player in Orioles history to 
appear in all six (1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1979, 1983) of their World Series 
appearances. Palmer was the only Orioles player on the 1983 championship 
team to have previously won a World Series. He retired after being released 
by Baltimore during the 1984 season. He was elected to the Hall of Fame 
in 1990, his first year of eligibility. While still an active player, Palmer 
did color commentary for ABC for their coverage of the 1978, 1980 and 1982 
American League Championship Series, 1981 American League Division Series 
between Oakland and Kansas City, and the 1981 World Series. From 1985 to 
1989, Palmer formed an announcing team with Al Michaels and Tim McCarver 
at ABC. Palmer announced the 1985 World Series, where he was supposed to 
team with Michaels and Howard Cosell, whom Palmer had worked with on the 
previous year's ALCS. McCarver replaced Cosell for the World Series at 
the last minute after Cosell released a book (I Never Played the Game) 
that was critical of the ABC Sports team. The team of Palmer, Michaels 
and McCarver would subsequently go on to call the 1986 All-Star Game (that 
year, Palmer worked with Michaels on the ALCS while McCarver teamed with 
Keith Jackson on ABC's coverage of the National League Championship Series), 
the 1987 World Series, and 1988 All-Star Game as well as that year's NLCS. 
Palmer was present at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on October 17, 1989, 
when the Loma Prieta earthquake hit prior to Game 3 of the World Series.[13] 
After the 1989 season, ABC lost its contract to broadcast baseball to CBS. 
Palmer had earned $350,000 from ABC that year for appearing on around ten 
regular season broadcasts and making a few postseason appearances.[14] 
In 1990, the Los Angeles Times reported that Palmer was thinking of pursuing 
work as a major league manager. Instead, Palmer worked as an analyst for 
ESPN and as a broadcaster for Orioles games on their local television station.[14] 
In 1991, Palmer attempted a comeback with the Orioles. Palmer said that 
he wanted to make sure that he had not retired too early. ESPN, which was 
trying to cut expenses, had asked him to take a pay cut and to sign a three-year 
contract. Palmer said he would sign a one-year contract for less pay, but 
ESPN refused. "I wouldn't be here today if the broadcasting climate had 
been more to my liking. That was really my prime motivation, the fact that 
I no longer had that obligation", Palmer said during spring training.[15] 
Covering Palmer's spring training workouts, Richard Hoffer of Sports Illustrated 
said that Palmer's comeback was not entirely about money. He wrote that 
"it is fair to suspect that a certain vanity is involved."[16] Hoffer said 
that Palmer "has failed to excite either ridicule or astonishment. He's 
in fabulous condition, no question. But no matter whom he lines up with 
on the row of practice mounds, there is more pop in the gloves of catchers 
other than his."[16] While working out at the University of Miami during 
his comeback attempt, Palmer was approached by Miami assistant coach Lazaro 
Collazo. Collazo reportedly told him, "You'll never get into the Hall of 
Fame with those mechanics." "I'm already in the Hall of Fame", Palmer replied.[16] 
To help Palmer's pitching motion, Collazo and Palmer completed unusual 
drills that involved Palmer placing a knee or foot on a chair as he tossed 
the ball.[16] After giving up five hits and two runs in two innings of 
a spring training game, he retired permanently. Palmer said that he tore 
his hamstring while warming up for the game, commenting, "I'm not saying 
I wouldn't like to continue, but I can't", he said. "I heard something 
pop in my leg yesterday. It wasn't a nice sound. I don't know what that 
means, but I think it's going to play havoc with my tennis game."[17] He 
retired with a 268-152 win-loss record and a 2.86 ERA. From 1994 to 1995, 
Palmer returned to ABC (this time, via a revenue sharing joint venture 
between Major League Baseball, ABC and NBC called The Baseball Network) 
to broadcast with McCarver and Michaels. In 1995, the reunited team of 
Palmer, McCarver and Michaels would call the All-Star Game, Game 3 of that 
NLDS between Cincinnati and Los Angeles, Game 4 of the NLDS between Atlanta 
and Colorado, Games 1–2 of the NLCS, and Games 1, 4–5 of the World Series. 
Palmer, McCarver and Michaels were also intended to call the previous year's 
World Series for ABC, but were denied the opportunity when the entire postseason 
was canceled due to a strike. He is currently a color commentator on MASN's 
television broadcasts of Oriole games. In July 2012, Palmer put up for 
auction his three Cy Young Award trophies and two of his four Gold Glove 
Awards. "At this point in my life, I would rather concern myself with the 
education of my grandchildren", he said.[18] Palmer also noted that his 
autistic teenage stepson would require special care and that "my priorities 
have changed."[18] Palmer had put up for auction one of his Cy Young Award 
trophies on behalf of a fundraising event for cystic fibrosis in years 
past, although he stated the winning bidder "had paid $39,000 for that 
and never ever took it. It was for the cause."[18] Palmer has been considered 
one of the best pitchers in major-league history. Palmer is the only pitcher 
in big-league history to win World Series games in three decades. During 
his 19-year major league career of 575 games (including 17 postseason games), 
he never surrendered a grand slam, nor did he ever allow back-to-back homers. 
Palmer's career earned run average (2.856) is the third lowest among starting 
pitchers whose careers began after the advent of the live-ball era in 1920. 
In six ALCS and six World Series, he posted an 8–3 record with 90 strikeouts, 
and an ERA of 2.61 and two shutouts in 17 games. He was a mainstay in the 
rotation during Baltimore's six pennant-winning teams in the 1960s (1966 
& 1969), 1970s (1970, 1971 and 1979) and 1980s (1983). With the passing 
of Mike Cuellar in 2010, Palmer became the last surviving member of the 
1971 Baltimore starting rotation that included four 20-game winners. Palmer 
won spots on six All-Star teams, received four Gold Glove Awards and won 
three Cy Young Awards. He led the league in ERA twice and in wins three 
times. Palmer is one of a few pitchers to win a World Series in three decades 
(1960s, 70s, and 80s). In 1999, he ranked No. 64 on The Sporting News' 
list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,[19] and was nominated as a finalist 
for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. During the late 1970s, 
Palmer was a spokesman and underwear model for Jockey brand men's briefs. 
He appeared in the company's national print and television advertisements 
as well as on billboards at Times Square in New York City and other major 
cities. He donated all proceeds from the sale of his underwear poster to 
the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. From 1992 until 1999, he was frequently 
seen on television throughout the United States in commercials for The 
Money Store, a national home equity and mortgage lender. He has periodically 
appeared in ads and commercials for vitamins and other health-related products. 
Palmer also represents Cosamin DS, a joint health supplement made by Nutramax 
Laboratories in Edgewood, Maryland. He was also the spokesperson for Nationwide 
Motors Corp., which is a regional chain of car dealerships located in the 
Middle Atlantic region. He is currently a spokesman for the national "Strike 
Out High Cholesterol" campaign.[20] Additionally, Palmer serves as a member 
of the advisory board of the Baseball Assistance Team, a 501(c)(3) non-profit 
organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and 
Negro League players through financial and medical difficulties. In 1996, 
Palmer published a less-than-flattering view of his relationship with Earl 
Weaver, titled 'Together We Were Eleven Foot Nine: The Twenty-Year Friendship 
of Hall of Fame Pitcher Jim Palmer and Orioles Manager Earl Weaver." In 
a January 2013 USA Today article, Palmer was quoted as saying, "He wasn't 
a warm and fuzzy guy, but Earl got us to those World Series... I've seen 
a lot of Broadway shows in my time, but I never saw a better show than 
Earl with an umpire. Some people wondered if that was staged. I don't think 
so. I think he got lost in the moment."[21] Shortly after graduating from 
high school in 1963, he married the former Susan Ryan in 1964, with whom 
he has two daughters, Jamie and Kelly.[22][23] A ten-year marriage to Joan 
H. Palmer ended in divorce in May 2000. In April 2001, he was found in 
contempt of court for failing to transfer $175,000 from his pension fund 
to his ex-wife and ordered to pay $13,500 in legal fees.[24] As of 2008, 
Palmer and his third wife Susan (Schmidt – July 2007)[25] have homes in 
Palm Beach, Florida, and in California. In 2006, Palmer also acquired a 
penthouse condominium in Little Italy, Baltimore, which he uses while in
