Frank Daryl Tanana (born July 3, 1953) is a former Major League Baseball 
left-handed pitcher. He was the California Angels' first-round draft pick 
in 1971. From 1973 to 1993, he pitched for six teams: the Angels, Boston 
Red Sox, Texas Rangers, Detroit Tigers, New York Mets, and New York Yankees. 
In his prime, Tanana was known for a 100+ MPH fastball, which he abruptly 
lost when he injured his arm. However, he was able to develop an assortment 
of off-speed pitches (including an excellent curveball) and continue his 
career. Throughout his career, he accumulated 34 shutouts, 4000 innings 
pitched, and nearly 3000 strikeouts. Tanana attended Detroit Catholic Central 
High School and California State University, Fullerton before embarking 
on his baseball career. Tanana's father, also named Frank, had played professional 
baseball in the 1950s and was on the 1955 Eastern League championship team, 
the Reading Indians, before he left baseball and joined the Detroit Police 
Department.[1] Along with Nolan Ryan, Tanana anchored the pitching staff 
of the California Angels from 1973 to 1979. This led to the saying, "Tanana 
and Ryan and two days of cryin'", an indication of just how much the two 
meant to the rotation. On June 21, 1975, Tanana struck out 17 batters in 
one game. The Angels' offense did not always measure up to its top twosome; 
in 1976, Tanana and New York's Catfish Hunter each pitched 13 scoreless 
innings in a game where both men received a no-decision. Tanana had had 
another 13-inning shutout no-decision in 1975 against the White Sox, and 
is the only pitcher with two such outings. Tanana appeared in three consecutive 
All-Star Games from 1976 to 1978, and led the league in strikeouts in 1975 
as well as in ERA and shutouts in 1977. Tanana missed two months of the 
1979 season with a shoulder injury, but was able to pitch in September 
and during the post-season. On January 23, 1981, the Angels traded him 
to the Boston Red Sox along with Jim Dorsey and Joe Rudi for Steve Renko 
and Fred Lynn (whom the Red Sox worried they would lose to free agency 
due to paperwork errors). Tanana pitched for the Red Sox for a single season, 
earning only 4 victories against 10 losses before being granted free agency 
on November 13, 1981. Tanana signed as a free agent with Texas Rangers 
on January 6, 1982. In 1984, he was named the pitcher of the year for the 
team as he went 15-15 with a 3.25 earned run average (ERA). He was traded 
by the Rangers to the Detroit Tigers for minor-league pitcher Duane James 
on June 20, 1985. Tanana returned home to Detroit due to the trade, then 
signed free agent contracts with the team in 1988 and 1989 to stay with 
the team until 1992. On the final day of the 1987 season, Tanana pitched 
a 1-0 complete game shutout over the 2nd place Toronto Blue Jays to clinch 
the American League East title for the Tigers. He was referred to as "the 
great tantalizer" because of his wide array of slow offspeed pitches. These 
he managed to mix very effectively, frustrating opposing batters and making 
an 88Â mph fastball surprising and effective when slipped in after a steady 
diet of breaking balls. It was during this time that ESPN's Baseball Tonight 
would refer to him as "the guy who threw 90 in the 70s and 70 in the 90s." 
Tanana signed as a free agent with the Mets for the 1993 season, winning 
7 games for the last place team before being traded to the New York Yankees 
for Kenny Greer in an attempt to capture the pennant with the 1993-09-17 
trade. He lost 2 of his three starts for the Yankees and they did not reach 
the post-season.[2] In 1993, Tanana became one of only two pitchers in 
MLB history to give up a home run to both Hank Aaron and Barry Bonds.[3] 
He converted to Protestantism midway through his career and became a leader 
in the Christian community within professional baseball. Tanana has been 
married to Cathy Mull since 1978. They have four children and four sons-in-law 
and now reside in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Both serve on the Pro Athletes 
Outreach Board of Directors, and are involved in the Home Plate and Career 
Impact ministries. In 1996, Tanana was inducted into the National Polish-American 
Sports Hall of Fame,[4] and in 2006, Tanana was inducted into the Michigan 
Sports Hall of Fame. He was given the nickname "Frank Tanana Daiquiri" 
by broadcaster Chris Berman of ESPN. As he became a successful junk-baller 
for the Tigers in the 1980s, Tiger broadcasting legend Ernie Harwell would
