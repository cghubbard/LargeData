As player As manager Thomas Clancy Sheehan (March 31, 1894 – October 29, 
1982) was an American pitcher, scout and manager in Major League Baseball. 
Born in Grand Ridge, Illinois, Sheehan, a right-hander, had a six-year 
pitching career from 1915–16, 1921 and 1924–26, playing for the Philadelphia 
Athletics and New York Yankees of the American League and the Cincinnati 
Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League. He pitched for two 
of the worst teams in big league history — the 1915-16 Athletics. Manager 
and part-owner Connie Mack totally dismantled his 1914 AL-champion club 
after it was swept by the "Miracle" Boston Braves in the World Series. 
After Mack replaced his stars with inexperienced players, the A's of 1915–16 
won a total of 79 games, while losing 226 — a winning percentage of only 
.259. At 21, Sheehan won four games and lost nine in 1915, but the following 
season he dropped 16 of 17 decisions (.059), although he compiled a decent 
earned run average of 3.69. Overall, Sheehan appeared in 146 major league 
games, winning 17 and losing 39 (.304) with a 4.00 ERA. Sheehan coached 
for the Reds (1935–37) and Boston Braves (1944), and spent many years as 
a minor league manager and scout for the New York/San Francisco Giants. 
In June 1960, at age 66, he succeeded the fired Bill Rigney as pilot of 
the Giants. Sheehan became the oldest person to make his debut as a big-league 
manager. The move was a shocker, and it backfired. Rigney's Giants had 
won 33 of 58 games and were in second place in the National League; but 
under Sheehan, San Francisco won 46, lost 50 (.479) and fell to a second-division, 
fifth-place finish. Sheehan resumed his scouting duties at season's end.
