Louis Glenn Marson (born June 26, 1986) is an American professional baseball 
catcher in the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim organization. He has played 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies and Cleveland 
Indians. Marson stands 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) and weighs 200 pounds (91 kg).[1] 
He bats and throws right-handed. The Philadelphia Phillies drafted Marson 
in the fourth round of the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft out of Coronado 
High School in Scottsdale, Arizona.[2] During 2004, he played with the 
Gulf Coast League Phillies instructional league team, where he ended the 
season with a seven-game hitting streak.[3] In 38 games, Marson amassed 
a total of 29 hits, including three doubles and four home runs, for a batting 
average of .257. He also stole four bases.[4] During his first full season 
in the Phillies' system, Marson played with the A-level Batavia Muckdogs. 
He played 60 games for the short-season squad, batting .245 with five home 
runs and three triples.[4] He also drew 27 bases on balls[5] and hit .351 
against left-handed pitchers.[6] Moving up to the South Atlantic League 
for the 2006 season, Marson had a team-leading five triples and four stolen 
bases, though his average fell to .243.[4] He notched a four-hit game against 
the Hagerstown Suns, a four-RBI game in August against the Delmarva Shorebirds, 
and reached base safely in nearly every game in July.[7] Marson had 85 
hits in 350 at-bats in 2006 and added 29 walks for a .343 on-base percentage.[5] 
Marson made his first appearance at the Phillies' spring training in 2007, 
after which he was assigned to the high-A Clearwater Threshers. He led 
the 2007 Threshers in batting average (.288) among qualifying players, 
hit 7 home runs and batted in 63 runs.[8] He established himself as a solid 
fielder behind the plate, making only three errors in the final 37 games 
of the season[9] and finishing with a fielding percentage of .982 for the 
season.[8] After the 2007 season, Marson was recognized as one of the top 
ten prospects in the Phillies' minor league system by Baseball America.[10] 
2008 was a breakout season for Marson, as he won the Paul Owens Award as 
the top minor league player in the Phillies' farm system.[11] In 94 games 
behind the plate for the AA Reading Phillies, Marson batted .314 with five 
home runs and 18 doubles. He also walked 68 times.[4] For his efforts, 
he was named to both the midseason and post-season Eastern League All-Star 
teams.[11] He led that league, and all AA-level leagues, in on-base percentage 
with a .433 mark[4][12] and posted a 14-game hitting streak at the end 
of May, during which he had a grand slam and six RBI in one game.[11] A 
converted infielder with a strong arm,[13] he allowed 30 baserunners in 
83 stolen-base attempts for a steal percentage of 36%.[4] The Phillies 
purchased Marson's contract at the conclusion of the 2008 Eastern League 
season, and he was called up to the majors for the post-season stretch 
run. After the season, the Phillies' farm system director, Steve Noworyta, 
said that Marson "continues, like fine wine, to get better as he ages."[14] 
His stock as a Baseball America prospect rose from eighth in the system 
to third,[15] and he was named one of the top 50 prospects in Major League 
Baseball.[12] Marson was called up to the Phillies on September 1, 2008. 
He had his first major league hit off of Odalis Perez on September 28 against 
the Washington Nationals. He later scored his first run in the same inning. 
In the same game, he also hit his first big league home run off Marco Estrada.[16] 
This was on the final day of the 2008 Philadelphia Phillies season; though 
Marson was not included on the World Series-winning roster,[17] he did 
travel with the team in case of injuries.[18] He did receive a World Series 
ring, in spite of all this.[19] After the end of the post-season, Marson 
participated in the Arizona Fall League, where he played for the Mesa Solar 
Sox.[20] Marson participated in the major league 2009 spring training with 
the Phillies, where veteran starter Jamie Moyer expressed his pleasure 
with Marson's skills and ability to call the game.[13] Assistant GM Chuck 
LaMar said that "[his] strength has actually become his ability to run 
the game… That is unique for a converted catcher. We think he's one of 
the finest catching prospects in baseball." Marson was reassigned to the 
minor leagues on March 23,[21] but was called up to the majors on April 
11 to replace Carlos Ruiz, who injured his right oblique muscle.[22] He 
went 1-for-4 in one game for the Lehigh Valley IronPigs before his call-up.[23] 
On July 29, 2009, the Phillies traded Marson, along with Jason Donald, 
Carlos Carrasco, and Jason Knapp to the Cleveland Indians for Cliff Lee 
and Ben Francisco.[24] Over the next three seasons, Marson was a fixture 
behind the plate for Cleveland, playing in over 70 games in each of the 
2010, 2011 and 2012 seasons—however, he struggled at the plate, never hitting 
higher than .230. After a 2013 season in which he only appeared in 3 games 
at the major league level, Marson was non-tendered by the Indians, becoming 
a free agent.[25] On December 18, 2013, the Philadelphia Phillies signed 
Marson to a minor league contract, that included a spring training invitation. 
He was released on March 14, 2014. Marson signed a minor league deal with 
the Cincinnati Reds in May 2014. Marson and Reading teammate Jason Donald 
were selected to the United States national baseball team for the 2008 
Olympics,[26] where they won the bronze medal.[27] National team manager 
Davey Johnson said that "[he] really impressed me during (the Futures Game)… 
He caught the first three innings. We don't give the signs to the catcher. 
He told (pitcher) Brett Anderson to throw over to first and he picked (a 
runner off). His numbers are outstanding for a catcher—great offensive 
catcher—and I got reports that said everything about him is good."[28]
