Reds and the Louisville Colonels, Harrington batted .227 with 60 runs, 
151 hits, 19 doubles, six triples, three home runs, 73 runs batted in (RBIs), 
and eight stolen bases. Harrington was born in Hamden, Ohio on August 12, 
1868. His father was the manager of the Keokuk, Iowa baseball club in 1885.[1] 
At the age of 16, Jerry Harrington began to play semi-professional baseball
