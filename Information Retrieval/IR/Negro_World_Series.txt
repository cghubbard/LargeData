The Negro World Series was a post-season baseball tournament which was 
held from 1924–1927 and from 1942–1948 between the champions of the Negro 
leagues, matching the mid-western winners against their east coast counterparts. 
The series was also known as the Colored World Series, especially during 
the 1920s, and as the Negro League World Series, in more recent books, 
though contemporary black newspapers usually called it simply, the "World 
Series", without any modification. After the organization of first Negro 
National League (NNL) in 1920 and of the Eastern Colored League (ECL) in 
1923, many Negro league fans hoped that the two leagues would compete in 
a post-season championship similar to the World Series held by the white 
leagues. On September 2, 1924, Rube Foster, president of the NNL announced 
that Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, Commissioner of Baseball for the white 
major leagues, had been asked to arbitrate the differences between the 
NNL and the ECL and establish an agreement similar to the one used by the 
American and National Leagues. The proposed agreement required the two 
leagues to respect each other's contracts, made allowances for players 
who had jumped contracts to stay with their current teams, and for a post-season 
championship between the leagues. The first championship was between the 
Kansas City Monarchs of the NNL and the Hilldale Club of the ECL.[1] In 
1928, the ECL folded, with their teams returning to independent play, and 
the series entered a 15-year hiatus. The first NNL also folded after the 
1931 season.[2] A second Negro National League was organized in 1933, though 
this league played predominantly in the East. The Negro American League 
was organized in 1937 in the West. In 1942, the two leagues agreed to resume 
playing a championship series between the two leagues; the first series 
was played between the Kansas City Monarchs of the NAL and the Homestead 
Grays of the NNL.[3] † — The Kansas City Monarchs were the only Negro league 
team to appear in both the earlier Colored World Series and the later Negro
