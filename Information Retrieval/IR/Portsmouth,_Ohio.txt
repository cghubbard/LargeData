Portsmouth is a city in and the county seat of Scioto County, Ohio, United 
States.[6] It lies in far southern Ohio, just east of the mouth of the 
Scioto River at the Ohio River, and across from Kentucky. The population 
was 20,226 at the 2010 census. According to historian Charles Augustus 
Hanna, a Shawnee village was founded at the site of modern-day Portsmouth 
in late 1758, following the destruction of Lower Shawneetown by floods.[7] 
Portsmouth's European-American roots date to the 1790s, when the small 
town of Alexandria was founded west of Portsmouth's site.[8] Alexandria 
was flooded numerous times by the Ohio and the Scioto rivers, especially 
in a massive flood in January and February 1937. In 1803, Henry Massie 
spotted a place to move the town away from the flood plains. He began to 
plot the new city by mapping the streets and distributing the land. Portsmouth 
was founded in 1803 and was established as a city in 1815. Alexandria soon 
disappeared. Portsmouth quickly grew around an industrial base due to its 
location at the confluence of the Ohio and Scioto rivers; early industrial 
growth included having meat packing and shipping facilities for Thomas 
Worthington's Chillicothe farm, located north of Portsmouth on the Scioto 
River. Portsmouth growth continued with the completion of the Ohio and 
Erie Canal,[9] which provided access to the Great Lakes, opening up northern 
markets. The construction of the N&W railyards and the B&O junction at 
the city also stimulated growth, with railroads soon carrying more freight 
than the canal. By the end of the 19th century, Portsmouth became one of 
the most important cities on the Ohio River between Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. 
By 1916, Portsmouth was listed as being a major industrial and jobbing 
center, with it being the fourth-largest shoe manufacturing center in the 
country and the largest manufacturer of fire and paving bricks in the United 
States. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel (later called Empire-Detroit Steel) employed 
over one thousand people. There were 100 other manufacturing companies 
producing goods from furniture to engines.[10] Industrial and shipping 
growth greatly benefited Boneyfiddle (a west-end neighborhood in Portsmouth), 
where grand buildings were constructed with the wealth from the commerce. 
As time passed, much of the commerce began to move towards Chillicothe 
Street, which is still today the main thoroughfare of Portsmouth. While 
Boneyfiddle is receiving new life, it is a shadow of its former self. Another 
notable part of Portsmouth's history in the 19th century was its importance 
on the Underground Railroad. Fugitive slaves used this route to continue 
north to Detroit and into Canada to gain freedom.[11] The population peaked 
at just over 42,000 in 1930 (see "Demographics", below), and by the 1950 
census, the population had fallen below 40,000. Foreign competition and 
industrial restructuring resulted in most of the industrial jobs on which 
Portsmouth's economy was based moving out of the area. Following these 
declines, in 1980 when Empire-Detroit Steel-Portsmouth Works suspended 
local operations after the sale of the steel plant to Armco Steel (now 
AK Steel). Armco Steel closed the plant because they did not want to replace 
the obsolete Open Hearth Furnaces with the more efficient basic oxygen 
steel furnaces. The plant also needed a continuous caster to replace the 
obsolete soaking pits and blooming mill in 1995. When the steel mill was 
closed, 1,300 steelworkers were laid off. As of 2010, the city has a population 
of approximately 20,000. It has shared in the loss of jobs due to unskilled 
labor outsourcing and population migration to more urban areas.[citation 
needed] Since the late 1990s and problems of unemployment, an epidemic 
of prescription drug abuse has swept the town and surrounding areas.[13] 
It has caused a dramatic increase in Hepatitis C cases in the county,[14] 
drug-related deaths,[15] robberies,[16][17][18] murder,[19] and an increased 
incidence of children born addicted to prescription drugs.[13] The most 
prevalent drug is OxyContin, a synthetic opiate originally developed as 
a cancer drug, known colloquially as oxys and hillbilly heroin (because 
of the drugs association with Appalachian areas of Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
Virginia, and West Virginia).[20] The crisis is blamed on the proliferation 
of cash-only pain clinics, known as "pill mills" by locals. According to 
authorities, there are eight such clinics in Scioto County alone,[15] the 
largest concentration of such operations per capita in any of Ohio's counties.[21] 
The clinics began opening in the late 1990s, after state legislators passed 
a law stating that doctors could not be prosecuted for prescribing painkillers 
as long as they had examined and documented that a patient was in intractable 
pain and needed the medication.[22] The slightly more than half a dozen 
pain clinics dispense nearly 35 million pills a year,[13] or, according 
to 2008 state pharmacy board statistics, roughly 460 pills for every resident 
in a county of 76,000 people.[23] The geographic location has played a 
role in the size of the problem. Because Portsmouth is located at the junction 
of three states and on the routes of several north-south and east-west 
highways, it has become a distribution point for more than just the local 
area. The separate state jurisdictions do not track prescriptions among 
the others, making it harder to tell where the prescriptions are going. 
Generations of poverty have helped to create an underground economy supporting 
the distribution of illegal substances.[23] As of spring 2011, the county 
has had more than 120 drug-related deaths over the preceding decade,[13] 
and in 2009 had the second-highest death rate in the state from accidental 
drug overdoses, although it is sparsely populated compared to the urban 
population centers of the state.[24] According to Lisa Roberts, a registered 
nurse with the Portsmouth City Health Department, Southern Ohio distributes 
four times as many prescription drugs as Northern Ohio, contributing to 
the high death rates.[12] Local deaths from a lethal drug combination of 
opiates, sedatives and muscle relaxants are so common that locals have 
dubbed it the Portsmouth Cocktail.[13] Admissions into rehab facilities 
for painkiller addictions in the town are five times the national average.[25] 
Almost one in 10 infants born in Scioto County in recent years has been 
addicted to prescription drugs.[25] Because of the extent of the problem, 
the Drug Enforcement Administration has listed Scioto County on its watch 
list of the 10 most significant places in the country for trafficking in 
prescription drugs.[15] In February 2011 NBC Universal had a film crew 
in the city filming for the cable TV show Intervention.[26] On April 11, 
2011 the show aired as a special episode: "Intervention In-Depth: Hillbilly 
Heroin." It explored the effects of prescription drug abuse on residents 
of the town and surrounding area.[27] In 2007 Paul Volkman, a doctor from 
Chicago who had worked at a pain clinic in Portsmouth since 2003, was indicted. 
He was tried in February 2011 at the federal court in Cincinnati.[28] Volkman 
was convicted of 18 counts of illegal prescription drug distribution, and 
was found guilty related to the deaths of four of his patients. He is suspected 
of causing nearly 20 deaths. He faces from 20 years to life in prison.[29] 
In 2011 the DEA and state and local law enforcement agencies worked to 
crack down on this problem. On May 17, 2011 the DEA served Immediate Suspension 
Orders (suspension of their license to practice medicine) on four local 
doctors and a pharmacy in Scioto County, including Dr. Margy Temponeras. 
In a press release, the DEA said that Temponeras was one of the largest 
dispensers of controlled substances in the US.[30] The DEA also served 
ISOs on three other doctors: John Temponeras, Mark Fantazuzzi, and Michael 
Dawes, and a pharmacy, Prime Pharmacy, located at 902 Fourth Street in 
Portsmouth.[30] The DEA had made a preliminary finding that the continued 
registration of these doctors and pharmacy constituted an imminent danger 
to public health and safety. The orders prohibit the parties from possessing 
or dispensing controlled substances, pending the outcome of ongoing investigations.[31] 
As a result of the ISO, Dr. John Temponeras resigned from his position 
at the Southern Ohio Medical Center.[32] The support group SOLACE formed 
to tackle this problem; it has helped to raise public awareness of the 
issue and has lobbied the state house for legislation.[33] Governor John 
Kasich referred to the group in his first State of the State Address, and 
members of the group were featured in the A&E documentary entitled Intervention 
In-Depth: Hillbilly Heroin (2011).[34] The group opened an official headquarters 
in Portsmouth[35] and worked with Attorney General Mike DeWine to make 
a documentary about drug abuse.[36] SOLACE's efforts have been promoted 
as an example of how a small, dedicated group could effect real change 
in their community.[37] But, Ohio voters in 2011 rejected a proposed $1 
million drug prevention tax levy backed by SOLACE and other anti-drug abuse 
organizations.[38] In May 2011 the Ohio Senate and House unanimously passed 
House Bill 93, authored by Portsmouth's representative in the Ohio House, 
Dr. Terry Johnson, which dealt with improved regulation of pain clinics. 
The legislation called for a performance analysis of the Ohio Automated 
Rx Review System, limits the ability of prescribers to personally furnish 
controlled substances, reforms Medicaid provisions to improve consumer 
education, improves licensing and law enforcement issues related to pain-management 
clinics, and calls for the development of a statewide prescription drug 
"take-back" program.[39] The amended bill was signed into law by Governor 
John Kasich on May 20, 2011.[40] As of the census[2] of 2010, there were 
20,226 people, 8,286 households, and 4,707 families residing in the city.

of the Ohio, Scioto, and Little Scioto Rivers. Portsmouth is a midway point 
among four major cities: Charleston, West Virginia, Cincinnati and Columbus, 
Ohio; and Lexington, Kentucky, each of which are approximately ninety miles 
away (roughly a two-hour drive). Much of the terrain is quite hilly due 
to dissected plateau around it. Both rivers have carved valleys and Portsmouth 
lies next to both the Scioto and Ohio rivers. It is within the ecoregion 
of the Western Allegheny Plateau.[45] According to the United States Census 
Bureau, the city has a total area of 11.07 square miles (28.67 km2), of 
which 10.73 square miles (27.79 km2) is land and 0.34 square miles (0.88 km2) 
is water.[1] The city charter was adopted on November 6, 1928. The city 
conducts business at their city hall, which was constructed in 1935. City 
council meetings are held during the second and fourth weeks in the month. 
The city reverted from being run by a city manager to a mayor in 1988, 
with the mayor being elected every four years. In 2012 voters approved 
returning to a City Manager/Council form of government; this took effect 
in January 2014. Under the City Manager/Council system, the mayor and vice-mayor 
are elected members of the city council who are appointed to their positions 
by the council. The city manager is hired by and reports directly to the 
council. The city manager oversees the day-to-day operations of city government 
and is the direct supervisor of all city department heads. There are six 
wards in the city with elections of council members from the wards every 
two years. City Manager is Derek K. Allen.[46] [47] Portsmouth is the county 
seat for Scioto County. The courthouse is located at the corner of Sixth 
and Court Streets and was constructed in 1936. The sheriff's office and 
county jail, once located in the courthouse, are located in a new facility, 
constructed in 2006 at the former site of the Norfolk and Western rail 
depot near U.S. 23. Portsmouth major employers include Southern Ohio Medical 
Center, United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC), Shawnee State University, 
Norfolk Southern Corp.(Railroad), Southern Ohio Correctional Facility and 
OSCO Industries. In November 2002, the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant 
in nearby Piketon, Ohio was recognized as a Nuclear Historic Landmark by 
the American Nuclear Society. It had served a military function from 1952 
until the mid-1960s, when the mission changed from enriching uranium for 
nuclear weapons to one focused on producing fuel for commercial nuclear 
power plants. The Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant ended enriching operations 
in 2001 and began to support operational and administrative functions and 
perform external contract work. All uranium enrichment in the area has 
been taken over by a sister plant in Paducah, Kentucky. Uranium enrichment 
functions had previously been shared by the two plants. USEC interests 
in the area remain strong with the American Centrifuge Plant under construction 
in Piketon. This commercial uranium enrichment facility was expected to 
employ up to 500 people and reach an initial annual production level of 
3.8 million SWU by 2012.[48] Graf Brothers Flooring and Lumber, the world's 
largest manufacturer of rift and quartered oak products, has two satellite 
log yards in Portsmouth, with the company's main office being located across 
the river in South Shore, Kentucky. Portsmouth was the home of Mitchellace 
Inc., the largest manufacturer of shoelaces in the world. Portsmouth is 
served by two major U.S. Routes: 23 and 52. Other significant roads include 
Ohio State Routes 73, 104, 139, 140, and 335. The nearest Interstate highway 
is I-64. Interstate 73 is planned to use the newly built Portsmouth bypass 
en route from North Carolina To Michigan. The I-74 Extension is planned 
to use US 52 through Portsmouth, running concurrently with I-73 on the 
eastern side of Portsmouth Portsmouth is an important location in the Norfolk 
Southern Railway network. Norfolk Southern operates a railyard and locomotive 
maintenance facility for its long distance shipping route between the coalfields 
of West Virginia and points east, to the Great Lakes. Competitor CSX Transportation 
operates a former Chesapeake & Ohio Railway line just east of the city 
in Sciotoville, which crosses the Ohio River on the historic Sciotoville 
Bridge. Amtrak offers passenger service to the Portsmouth area on its Cardinal 
route between New York City and Chicago. The passenger station is located 
on CSX Transportation-owned track in South Shore, Kentucky, across the 
Ohio River from Portsmouth. Portsmouth is served by the Greater Portsmouth 
Regional Airport (PMH), a general aviation airport. The airport is located 
in Minford, Ohio, approximately 12 miles (19 km) northeast of the city. 
The nearest commercial airport is Tri-State Airport (HTS) in Huntington, 
West Virginia, approximately 53 miles (85 km) southeast of the city. Public 
transportation for Portsmouth and its outlying areas is offered through 
Access Scioto County (ASC).[49] Portsmouth used to be home to Ohio University 
Southern Campus; however, it moved to Ironton (Lawrence County) in the 
early 1980s. The former Ohio University buildings became home to Shawnee 
State Community College. In 1986, through the efforts of Ohio House Speaker 
Vern Riffe, the state approved expansion of programs to qualify it as Shawnee 
State University, Ohio's thirteenth and newest institution. Portsmouth 
has one public and two private school systems (the Notre Dame schools and 
the Portsmouth STEM Academy). The Portsmouth City School District has served 
the city since its founding in the 1830s and is the public school in the 
city. Portsmouth City School District is notable having a storied basketball 
tradition by winning four OSHAA State Basketball Championships in 1931, 
1961, 1978, and 1988.[50] The Trojan basketball team has made 14 final 
four appearances, they are 1925, 1926, 1927, 1929, 1931 (1st), 1934 (2nd), 
1939, 1941, 1961 (1st), 1978 (1st), 1980 (2nd), 1988 (1st), 1990 (2nd).[51] 
and 2012 (2nd). The Trojan football team has also produced some notable 
teams as of late with an Associated Press Division 3 State Championship 
in 2000, a regional title, and state semi-final appearance in 2000, and 
finishing as regional runner up in both 2001, and 2002. In all the Trojans 
football team has sent 5 teams to the post season since 2000, as of the 
start of the 2009 season.[52][53] In 2000, Portsmouth voters passed a much 
needed school bond issue, which helped construct new schools for the district. 
The new schools opened for the 2006–2007 school year. These schools won 
the Grand Prize from School Planning & Management's 2007 Education Design 
Showcase. The award is awarded annually to the K-12 school that displays 
"excellence in design and functional planning directed toward meeting the 
needs of the educational program."[54][55] In addition, the school system 
plans to build a new $10 million athletic complex.[56] Portsmouth High 
School has an award winning Interactive Media program that has won multiple 
awards for both video and graphic design. The class is under the direction 
of Chris Cole and the students run the local cable station TNN CH25. In 
2009 the school system completed construction on a new $10 million athletic 
complex. The 25-acre (10 ha) Clark Athletic Complex[57] has a new football 
field, baseball field, softball field, tennis courts, and track.[56] The 
complex is named for Clyde and Maycel Clark of the Clark Foundation, major 
financial contributors for the construction of the facility.[58] The new 
complex, situated on the site of the former high school building and across 
the street from the current high school, has three paintings by mural artist 
Herb Roe, a 1992 Portsmouth High School alumnus.[59] The murals depict 
three of the sports played at the new facility: baseball, tennis, and football. 
Notre Dame (Catholic) Schools(formerly Portsmouth Central Catholic HS) 
have served the city's Roman Catholics and others since 1852. It is also 
notable for its football team, founded in 1929. It won two state championships 
in 1967 and 1970.[50] See also List of Registered Historic Places in Ohio, 
Scioto County. Many historical buildings in Portsmouth have been demolished 
because of poor upkeep, other city development, or the completion of new 
buildings that replaced the landmarks. Landmarks that have been demolished 
include the old Norfolk & Western rail depot, churches dating back to the 
early 20th century, houses dating to the 1850s, Grant Middle School, and 
the old Portsmouth High School and various elementary schools. Many buildings 
survive from the early 19th century. Old churches are among the reminders 
of Portsmouth's past and identity. The Columbia Theater was given a major 
facelift after it was damaged by fire.[60][61][62] Other noted historic 
buildings include the old monastery, which can be seen for miles, and Spartan 
Stadium, as well as numerous buildings in the Boneyfiddle Historic District, 
which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1982, students 
from Miami University conducted research on several of Portsmouth's most 
important historic buildings. This work resulted in an exhibition at the 
Miami University Art Museum and a book entitled Portsmouth: Architecture 
in an Ohio River Town.[63] The Portsmouth Public Library is the city's 
library, founded in 1879. It has branch libraries throughout Scioto County. 
The Southern Ohio Museum, founded in 1979, has more than sixty exhibits 
on display including artwork by Clarence Holbrook Carter and Jesse Stuart, 
China dolls, Native American artifacts, and works by local artists. The 
Indian Head Rock is an eight-ton sandstone boulder which until recently 
resided in the bottom of the Ohio River. The removal of the rock, has led 
the states of Kentucky and Ohio into a legislative battle to determine 
its ownership and disposition.[64] The rock has been returned to the state 
of Kentucky. Portsmouth has fourteen parks for residents and community 
use. These include Alexandria Park (Ohio and Scioto River confluence), 
Bannon Park (near Farley Square), Branch Rickey Park (on Williams Street 
near levee), Buckeye Park (near Branch Rickey Park), Cyndee Secrest Park 
(Sciotoville), Dr. Hartlage Park (Rose Street in Sciotoville), Labold Park 
(near Spartan Stadium), Larry Hisle Park (23rd Street & Thomas Ave.), Mound 
Park (17th & Hutchins Streets), York Park (riverfront), Spartan Stadium, 
Tracy Park (Chillicothe & Gay Streets), and Weghorst Park (Fourth & Jefferson 
Streets).[65] Although developed on higher ground, the city has been subject 
to seasonal flooding. The city had extensive flooding in 1884, 1913, and 
1937. After the flood of 1937, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed 
a floodwall protecting the city, which prevented two major floods in 1964 
and 1997. In 1992, the city of Portsmouth began honoring some of the many 
accomplishments of its area natives by placing a star on the riverside 
of the floodwall. This is known as the Portsmouth Wall of Fame and was 
instituted by then-mayor Frank Gerlach. Some of the honorees include Don 
Gullett, Al Oliver, and former United States Vice-President Dan Quayle, 
who was not a Portsmouth native.[66] In 1992 a nonprofit group headed by 
Dr. Louis R. Chaboudy was formed to investigate developing a mural-based 
tourist attraction on the floodwall. In the spring of 1993, mural artist 
Robert Dafford was commissioned and began painting murals of Portsmouth's 
history. He hired local art student Herb Roe as an assistant. Roe subsequently 
apprenticed to and worked for Dafford for 15 years.[67] The project eventually 
spanned sixty 20 feet (6.1 m) tall consecutive Portsmouth murals, stretching 
for over 2,000 feet (610 m).[68] Subjects covered by the murals span the 
history of the area from the ancient mound building Adena and Hopewell 
cultures to modern sporting events and notable natives. These subjects 
include: The original mural project was finished in the fall of 2003. Since 
then several additional panels have been added, including murals honoring 
Portsmouth's baseball heroes in 2006; and the Tour of the Scioto River 
Valley (TOSRV), a bicycle tour between Columbus and Portsmouth in 2007.[69] 
Portsmouth had a series of semi-pro football teams in the 1920s and 1930s, 
the most notable being the Portsmouth Shoe-Steels, whose roster included 
player-coach Jim Thorpe. From 1929 to 1933, the city was home to the Portsmouth 
Spartans, which joined the National Football League in 1930. The Spartans 
competed in the first professional football night game, against the Brooklyn 
Dodgers in 1930.[70][71] Despite their success, the team could not survive 
in the NFL's second-smallest city during the Great Depression; it was sold 
and moved to Detroit in 1934, where it became the Detroit Lions. In the 
late 20th century, the Portsmouth Explorers were one of the original teams 
in the Frontier League, a non-affiliated minor league baseball organization. 
The Explorers played in the league's first three seasons, from 1993 to 
1995. In 1938, Portsmouth was also the home of the Portsmouth Red Birds, 
a minor league team owned by the St. Louis Cardinals. In the late 1990s 
Portsmouth was home to the Superstar Wrestling Federation before its demise. 
More recently Revolutionary Championship Wrestling has made its home in 
Portsmouth, airing on local TV station WQCW. Revolutionary Championship 
Wrestling in Portsmouth has featured such stars as Big Van Vader, Jerry 
"The King" Lawler, Demolition Ax, "Beautiful" Bobby Eaton, "Wildcat" Chris 
Harris, and Ivan Koloff. Portsmouth is near the dividing line for several 
television markets, including Columbus, Cincinnati, and Huntington-Charleston. 
There are two local television stations including WTZP, an America One 
affiliate, and WQCW, a CW affiliate. Portsmouth is also served by WPBO, 
a PBS affiliate. Programs airing on WPBO are broadcast by WOSU in Columbus. 
Local radio stations WIOI, WNXT, WNKE, WZZZ, and WOSP-FM serve the radio 
listeners in the city. Portsmouth is also served by three newspapers. The 
Portsmouth Daily Times[72] is the city's only daily newspaper. The Community 
Common[73] is a free biweekly newspaper and the Scioto Voice[74] is a weekly 
newspaper, which is mailed to subscribers. The University Chronicle[75] 
is the student-led newspaper at Shawnee State University. Portsmouth has
