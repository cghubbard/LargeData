The 2004 Chicago Cubs season was the 133rd season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 129th in the National League and the 89th at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished 89-73, good for 3rd in the NL Central. Despite the strong record, 
the Cubs faltered down the stretch and missed the playoffs, and the season 
is largely viewed as a disappointment as a result. In 2004, despite the 
return of Greg Maddux and a midseason deal for Nomar Garciaparra, misfortune 
struck the Cubs again. They led the Wild Card by 1.5 games over San Francisco 
and Houston on September 25, and both of those teams lost that day, giving 
the Northsiders a chance at increasing the lead to a commanding 2.5 games 
with only eight games remaining in the season, but reliever LaTroy Hawkins 
blew a save to the Mets, allowing a three-run game-tying home run with 
two outs in the ninth. The Cubs lost the game in extra innings, a defeat 
that seemingly deflated the team, as they proceeded to drop 6 of their 
last 8 games as the Astros won the Wild Card. Despite the fact that the 
Cubs had won 89 games, this fallout was decidedly unlovable, as the Cubs 
traded superstar Sammy Sosa after he had left the season's final game early.
