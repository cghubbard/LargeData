Consol Energy Inc. /kənˈsɒl/ is an American energy company with interests 
in coal and natural gas production headquartered in the suburb of Cecil 
Township, in the Southpointe complex, just outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[3] 
Consol Energy is the leading producer of high-BTU bituminous coal in the 
United States and the U.S.'s largest underground coal mining company.[4] 
As of 2011, Consol had 4.4 billion tons of proven reserves, mainly in northern 
and central Appalachia and produced nearly 64 million tons of coal in 2010. 
The company has natural gas reserves totaling 3.7 trillion cu. ft. as of 
2011 and employs more than 8,800 people.[4] Consol Energy was originally 
created in 1860 as the Consolidation Coal Company after several small mining 
companies in Western Maryland decided to combine their operations. The 
company was formally established in 1864 and headquartered in Cumberland, 
Maryland for the first 85 years (1864–1945), where the company became the 
largest bituminous coal company in the eastern United States.[5] Western 
Maryland's coal production rose about 1 million short tons in 1865, exceeded 
4 million short tons by the turn of the century, and reached an all-time 
high of about 6 million short tons in 1907. A small amount of the coal 
production in the early 1900s was premium smithing coal (as in blacksmith) 
that was specially processed and delivered in boxcars to customers throughout 
the United States and Canada. In 1945, Consolidation Coal Company was merged 
with Pittsburgh Coal Company and its headquarters were moved to Western 
Pennsylvania. [6] With growing demand for natural gas in the U.S. following 
World War II, Consolidation Coal Company was acquired by the Continental 
Oil Company, or Conoco, in 1966.[6] By the mid-1970s, Consolidation Coal 
Company operated 56 mines and employed nearly 20,000 miners.[5] In 1981, 
Conoco along with Consolidation Coal Company was acquired by DuPont, which 
then sold some of its coal mining interests in Pennsylvania to the German 
energy company, Rheinbraun A.G.[6] Looking to invest in coal reserves in 
North America, Rheinbraun A.G offered Dupont stakes in coal mines and $890 
million in 1991 to join in an equal part joint venture creating Consol 
Energy.[7] Despite the cost of coal dropping in the 1990s, Consol's long-term 
contracts and investments in longwall mining techniques allowed the company 
to remain competitive.[5] In 1998, Dupont sold the large majority of its 
stake in Consol, leaving it with only a 6 percent share and Rheinbraun 
A.G with a 94 percent interest.[8] Consol also acquired Rochester & Pittsburgh 
Coal Company in 1998.[9] In 1999, Consol underwent a public offering (NYSE: 
CNX)[10] in order to pay down some of the debt the company had incurred 
with the majority buy-out from Dupont and the acquisition of Rochester 
& Pittsburgh Coal Company. Due to uncertainty surrounding demand for coal 
in the early 2000s, Consol began to place a greater emphasis on diversification, 
primarily into natural gas. Consol's first major natural gas investment 
was through the acquisition of MCN Energy Group Inc.'s methane reserves 
in southwestern Virginia for $160 million.[11] In 2001, Consol acquired 
Conoco Inc.'s coalbed methane gas production assets in southwestern Virginia.[12] 
Consol subsidiaries CNX Ventures and CNX Land Resources also began diversification 
efforts during this time into methane gas and timber and farming. In 2006, 
Consol spun off its subsidiary CNX Gas as a standalone company, but retained 
83 percent of the new company's shares.[13] On June 28, 2006,Consol Energy 
entered the S&P 500 replacing Knight-Ridder.[14] In 2007, CNX Gas also 
began investing heavily in natural gas exploration in the Marcellus Shale 
in Pennsylvania. In 2010, Consol acquired Dominion Resources Inc.'s natural 
gas production and exploration assets for 3.74 billion dollars, which included 
nearly 500,000 acres of Marcellus potential, tripling Consol's position 
in the Marcellus to approximately 750,000 acres. Consol also acquired all 
of the remaining publicly owned shares of CNX Gas for a cash payment of 
$991 million.[13] In 2010 Consol was also named by Forbes magazine as one 
of the "100 Most Trustworthy Companies."[15] in 2011, Consol entered into 
two separate joint venture agreements to expedite its natural gas production. 
The first, an agreement with Noble Energy, Inc. will jointly develop the 
company's 663,350 Marcellus Shale acres in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.[16] 
The second joint agreement, with Hess Corporation, will jointly explore 
and develop Consol's nearly 200,000 Utica Shale acres in Ohio.[17] Consol 
also began an expansion of its Baltimore Terminal in 2011 to increase capacity 
from 14 million to 16 million tons to increase its revenue from sales of 
its metallurgical coal.[18] Consol Energy operates as a producer of multiple 
energy sources, primarily for electric power generation. The company's 
largest assets consist of its coal and natural gas divisions, but Consol 
also maintains support services including Baltimore Marine Terminal, River 
Division, Research & Development, Land Division, and Fairmont Supply Company. 
Consol's Coal Division operates 12 coal mining complexes in four states 
in the United States, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia and 
Utah.[4] As of 2011, the company maintained an estimated 4.4 billion tons 
of proven and probable coal reserves and produced nearly 64 million tons 
of coal in 2010.[4] The coal produced from these mining operations are 
sold from offices in Pittsburgh, PA, Philadelphia, PA, and Atlanta, GA. 
Consol's coal division received the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office 
of Surface Mining National Award for Excellence in Surface Mining for the 
company's innovative reclamation practices in 2002, 2003, and 2004.[19] 
Consol's Gas Division deals with natural gas exploration, development and 
production, producing nearly 128 billion cubic feet of coalbed methane 
in 2010. With the acquisition of the exploration and production business 
of Dominion Resources in 2010, the company has access to over 3.7 trillion 
cubic feet of proved clean-burning natural gas reserves in Pennsylvania, 
West Virginia and Ohio, including coalbed methane and shale beds. The company 
currently has nearly 13,000 net producing wells.[4] As the owner of more 
than 430,000 surface acres in the U.S. and Canada, Consol Energy has a 
Land Division that oversees various projects, including selling reserve 
land that the company does not develop, land donation and conservation 
projects. Consol Energy has also been recognized for its reclamation efforts 
by national and state governments and has worked in partnership with several 
conservation groups on land reclamation projects.[20][21] Consol's River 
Division oversees transportation of coal and other products on the Monongahela, 
Allegheny, Kanawha, and Ohio Rivers with 22 tow and tugboats and over 620 
barges. Consol's Baltimore Marine terminal provides coal transshipment 
services from rail cars to ocean transport ships.[4] Consol's Water Division 
is involved in water purification with a focus on treating wastewater produced 
as a byproduct of hydraulic fracturing. The company operates reverse osmosis 
water purification plants and has a minority interest in a company that 
develops solar-powered water purification systems which, as of July 2012[update], 
was conducting a pilot test at one of Consol's gas drilling sites.[22][23] 
Consol also maintains the Fairmont Supply Company, dedicated to the sale 
and distribution of mining services and equipment. Additionally, the company 
operates the largest privately owned research and development facility 
in the industry that is devoted exclusively to coal and energy utilization 
and production.[24] In 2010, Consol Energy had an annual revenue of $5.236 
billion. Customers primarily include electric utilities and steel mills 
in the U.S., but demand from European utilities has increased during the 
2000s.[4] Consol Energy was ranked number 428 on the Fortune 500 list in 
2011.[25] In September 2009, several thousand fish were killed in Dunkard 
Creek, Monongalia County, West Virginia. While state officials attributed 
the fish kill to a golden algae bloom, an investigation by the Environmental 
Protection Agency claimed that mining discharges from Consol Energy's Blacksville 
No. 2 mine created the conditions for the golden algae bloom.[26] After 
halting operations at the mine following the fish kill, Consol was allowed 
to continue mining operations after coming to an agreement with the West 
Virginia Department of Environmental Protection to submit a proposal for 
discharge treatment plants by April 15 of 2010.[27] Consol also invested 
$200 million in a water treatment facility and paid a $5.5 million federal 
penalty to the U.S. Department of Justice and half to the West Virginia 
Department of Environmental Protection in 2011.[28] The company maintains 
that it was never found liable for the fish kill.[29] As a producer of 
coal and natural gas, the environmental impact of coal mining and natural 
gas drilling has been a subject of controversy for Consol Energy. Despite 
this, the company has been recognized for its efforts at environmental 
protection and was awarded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Climate 
Protection Award in 2002.[30] Additionally, Consol maintains ongoing environmental 
efforts aimed at restoring and enhancing property managed by the company 
and has worked with conservation groups including Ducks Unlimited and the 
National Wild Turkey Federation on habitat restoration efforts.[31] An 
ad by the National Rifle Association critical of President Barack Obama 
that was filmed on Consol's Blacksville No. 2 coal mine in West Virginia 
became an issue of political debate in 2009.[32] The National Rifle Association 
intended to ask miners the question "How do you feel about having your 
Second Amendment rights taken away if Obama becomes president." Word spread 
among pro-Obama miners who contacted their union, the United Mine Workers 
of America, resulting in 440 miners taking the day off to avoid appearing 
in the ad in a contract-sanctioned protest, halting production at Consol's 
Blacksville No. 2 coal mine.[33] Lobbying efforts on the part of Consol 
have also been an issue of controversy. In the first quarter of 2010, Consol 
spent $1.02 million in lobbying expenses on issues relating to the coal 
mining and natural gas industries.[34] Consol Energy has put its name to 
two sports facilities in its Pittsburgh-area. In 2007, Consol energy purchased 
the naming rights to Washington, Pennsylvania's minor league baseball team 
the Washington Wild Things' field, Consol Energy Park.[35] Consol later 
purchased the naming rights to the Consol Energy Center in 2008; the arena 
that hosts the Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League team. [36][37] 
It is estimated that Consol Energy won the bid for naming rights at a cost 
between $2.0 - $4.0 million per year, for 21 years. As of October 2016 
the Consol Energy Center has been renamed PPG Paints Arena as Consol Energy
