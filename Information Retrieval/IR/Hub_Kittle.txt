Hubert Milton "Hub" Kittle (February 19, 1917 – February 10, 2004) was 
an American professional baseball pitcher, manager and front office executive 
in the minor leagues and a pitching coach at the Major League level. When 
he took the mound for the Triple-A Springfield Redbirds in an official 
American Association game on August 27, 1980, at the age of 63, Kittle, 
a longtime minor league hurler whose professional career began in the 1930s, 
became the only man ever to pitch in professional baseball in six decades. 
He retired the Iowa Oaks on 11 pitches.[1] Kittle was born in Los Angeles 
and attended San Diego State University. As a player, he threw and batted 
right-handed, stood 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and weighed 195 pounds 
(88 kg). He began his pitching career in 1937 with the Ponca City Angels 
of the Class C Western Association, a farm club of the Chicago Cubs. Two 
years later, Kittle won 20 of 30 decisions pitching for the Yakima Pippins 
of the Class B Western International League—beginning a long association 
with professional baseball in Yakima, Washington, and the Pacific Northwest. 
Including his two years of military service during World War II, Kittle's 
active pitching career prior to his 1980 Springfield appearance spanned 
22 years (1937–55, plus cameos as a fill-in pitcher during his minor-league 
managerial career in 1958, 1966 and 1969). His appearance in the 1970s 
came in a Major League uniform during his tenure as the pitching coach 
of the Houston Astros, when he hurled in an exhibition game against the 
Detroit Tigers at the Astrodome at the age of 56 in 1973. All told, as 
a minor league pitcher, Kittle won 144 games and lost 115 (.556). He won 
7 games and lost 6 during his three stints (1940–41; 1943) at the highest 
minor league level, in the Pacific Coast League. Kittle's minor league 
managerial career was almost as long as his pitching tenure. It extended 
for 20 years (1948–59; 1964–70; 1977); he won regular season pennants with 
the 1950 Salt Lake City Bees in the Pioneer League, the 1953 Terre Haute 
Phillies of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League and the 1956 Yakima Bears 
of the Northwest League. In addition, Kittle was general manager of the 
Yakima Bears, and both the Hawaii Islanders and Portland Beavers of the 
Pacific Coast circuit. He was selected Minor League Executive of the Year 
(lower classification) by The Sporting News in 1960.[2] Kittle managed 
in the Philadelphia Phillies, Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves, Houston Astros 
and St. Louis Cardinals organizations. His career managerial record was 
1,329 victories and 1,250 defeats (.515). Kittle finally reached the Major 
Leagues in 1971 when he was named an Astros' coach by manager Harry Walker. 
He spent five years on Houston's MLB staff, and was the team's pitching 
coach in 1973, working with celebrated pitchers such as Larry Dierker, 
J. R. Richard and Don Wilson. In 1976, he joined the Cardinals' organization, 
and spent the next two decades with the Redbirds as a minor league manager, 
roving minor league pitching instructor, and Major League pitching coach 
from 1981–83. He was the pitching coach for the 1982 World Series champion 
Cardinals. He was still working with St. Louis' minor league pitchers as 
he neared his 80th birthday. "He's the Santa Claus of pitching coaches", 
Cardinals' field coordinator of instruction George Kissell said in 1989. 
"Only he can't come down the chimney anymore, his bag is so full of tricks. 
Nobody teaches pitching like he does."[1] Late in life, Kittle maintained 
his connection to baseball in the Pacific Northwest as a special, part-time 
pitching instructor in the Seattle Mariners' organization. He died at age
