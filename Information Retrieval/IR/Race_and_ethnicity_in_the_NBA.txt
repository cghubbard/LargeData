The composition of race and ethnicity in the National Basketball Association 
(NBA) has changed throughout the league's history. The first non-white 
player to enter the league was Wataru Misaka in 1947.[1] According to racial 
equality activist Richard Lapchick, the NBA in 2015 was composed of 74.4 
percent black players, 23.3 percent white players, 1.8 percent Latino players, 
and 0.2 percent Asian players.[2] The league has the highest percentage 
of black players of any major professional sports leagues in the United 
States and Canada.[3] In 1947, Wataru Misaka debuted as the first non-white 
player and the first player of Asian descent to play in the league.[1] 
African Americans first appeared in the NBA in 1950. Chuck Cooper was the 
first black player drafted in the NBA.[4] On April 26, 1950, Harold Hunter 
signed with the Washington Capitols, becoming the first African American 
to sign a contract with any NBA team in history.[5][6] However, Hunter 
was cut from the team during training camp and did not play professionally.[5][6][7] 
On May 24, Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton was the second African-American 
player to sign an NBA contract.[8][9][a] Earl Lloyd was the first to play 
in the NBA.[4] Hank DeZonie also played that year.[11] In 1953, Don Barksdale 
became the first African American to play in an NBA All-Star Game.[12] 
With the emergence of African-American players by the 1960s, the NBA game 
was stylistically being played faster and above the rim. Many of the league's 
great players were black. At that time, African Americans believed they 
were limited by an unofficial league quota of four black players per team.[13] 
Puerto Rican Butch Lee in 1978 was the first Latino in the league.[14] 
Wang Zhizhi became the first Chinese player in 2001.[15] In 2011, Richard 
Lapchick with The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) of 
the University of Central Florida reported in their annual Racial and Gender 
Report Card that 17 percent of the league's players were white, the lowest 
since the report began in 1990.[b][16][18][19] Hall of Fame player and 
Indiana Pacers president of basketball operations Larry Bird, who is white, 
stated in 2004 that the league needed more white players since the league's 
fans are mostly white. "And if you just had a couple of white guys in there, 
you might get them [the fans, not the guys] a little excited. But it is 
a black man's game, and it will be forever. I mean, the greatest athletes 
in the world are African-American," said Bird.[20][21] Bill Russell in 
1966 became the first non-white and African-American head coach in the 
NBA.[22][23] In the late 1980s, teams began hiring black coaches in large 
numbers.[22] At the start of the 2015–16 season, there were seven black 
head coaches in the league, down 50 percent from three years earlier, and 
the fewest in 16 years.[24] Robert Johnson of the Charlotte Bobcats (later 
known as the Charlotte Hornets) was the first black majority team owner 
in the NBA in 2004–05.[25] He was succeeded as Bobcats owner in 2010–11 
by another African American, Michael Jordan.[18] In 2013–14, Jordan and 
Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadivé, who is Indian, marked the first 
time in the history of major pro sports leagues in the U.S. that there
