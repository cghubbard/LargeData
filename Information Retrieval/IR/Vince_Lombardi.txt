Vincent Thomas "Vince" Lombardi (June 11, 1913 – September 3, 1970)[1] 
was an American football player, coach, and executive in the National Football 
League (NFL). He is best known as the head coach of the Green Bay Packers 
during the 1960s, where he led the team to three straight and five total 
NFL Championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two 
Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi is considered 
by many to be one of the best and most successful coaches in professional 
football history.[2] The NFL's Super Bowl trophy is named in his honor. 
He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971, the year after 
his death. Lombardi began coaching as an assistant and later as a head 
coach at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant 
coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New 
York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 
1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. He never had a losing 
season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage 
of 72.8 (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record 
of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.[3] Lombardi was born on 
June 11, 1913 in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico 
"Harry" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda "Mattie" Izzo (1891–1972).[4][5] 
Harry's mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, 
Italy.[6][7] Mattie's father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated 
from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata.[4][5] Harry had three siblings[4][7] 
and Matilda had twelve.[4][5] Vince would be the oldest of five children, 
Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe.[5][8] The entire Lombardi and Izzo 
clan settled in Sheepshead Bay.[4][9] Matilda's father, Anthony, opened 
up a barber shop in Sheepshead Bay before the turn of the century.[4][5] 
At about the time of Lombardi's birth, Harry, and his brother, Eddie, opened 
a butcher shop in the Meatpacking District.[4][10] Throughout the Great 
Depression, Harry's shop did well and his family prospered.[11][12] Lombardi 
grew up in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood.[13][14] Church 
attendance was mandatory for the Lombardis on Sundays.[15][16] Mass would 
be followed with an equally compulsory few hours of dinner with friends, 
extended family members, and local clergy.[17][18] He was an altar boy 
at St. Mark's Catholic Church.[15][16] Outside of their local neighborhood, 
the Lombardi children were subject to the rampant discrimination that existed 
at the time against Italian immigrants.[19] As a child, Lombardi helped 
his father at his meat cutting business, but grew to hate it.[20][21] At 
the age of 12 he started playing in an uncoached but organized football 
league in Sheepshead Bay.[16] Lombardi graduated from the eighth grade 
at P.S. 206, aged 15, in 1928.[9][22][note 1] He then matriculated with 
the Cathedral Preparatory Seminary (Queens) a part of Cathedral College 
of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program 
to become a Catholic priest.[9][22] At Cathedral, he played on the school's 
baseball and basketball teams,[23][24] but his performance was hindered 
by his poor athleticism and eyesight.[16] Against school rules, he continued 
to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral.[25] After 
completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood.[25] 
He enrolled at St. Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932.[26][27][note 
2] There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity.[28] 
His playing as a fullback on the Terriers' football team earned him a spot 
on the virtual All-City football team.[29][30] In 1933, Lombardi accepted 
a football scholarship[31] to Fordham University[32] in the Bronx to play 
for the Fordham Rams and Coach Jim Crowley, one of the Four Horsemen of 
Notre Dame in the 1920s. During his freshman year, Lombardi proved to be 
an aggressive and spirited player on the football field.[33] Prior to the 
start of his sophomore year, Lombardi was projected as a starter at tackle. 
Lombardi was undersized for the position (5'8" and about 180 lb.)[34] In 
his senior year (1936), he became the right guard in the Seven Blocks of 
Granite,[35] a nickname given to the Fordham University football team's 
offensive front line[36] by a Fordham University publicist.[note 3][37] 
In a game against Pitt, he suffered a severe gash inside his mouth and 
had several teeth knocked out.[38] He missed most of the remainder of the 
game, until he was called in on defense for a successful goal line stand 
that preserved a 0–0 tie. The Rams went 5–0–2[39] before losing in the 
final game of the season, 7–6, to NYU.[40] The loss destroyed all hopes 
of Fordham playing in the Rose Bowl and the loss taught Lombardi a lesson 
he would never forget — never to underestimate your opponent.[41] On June 
16, 1937, he graduated from Fordham University.[42][43] The economic outlook 
of the Great Depression offered him few opportunities for a career. For 
the next two years he showed no discernible career path or ambition. He 
tried his hand at semi-professional football with the Wilmington Clippers[44] 
of the American Association and as a debt collector but those efforts proved 
to be failures very quickly. With his father's strong support he enrolled 
in Fordham Law school in September 1938. Although he did not fail any classes, 
he believed his grades were so poor that he dropped out after one semester.[45] 
Later in life, he would explain to others that he was close to graduating, 
but his desire to start and support a family forced him to leave law school 
and get a job.[46] He would also then join the Brooklyn Eagles. In 1939, 
Lombardi wanted to marry his girlfriend, Marie Planitz,[47] but, at his 
father's insistence, he needed a steady job to support himself and a family.[48] 
In 1939, Lombardi accepted an assistant coaching job at St. Cecilia — which 
closed in 1986 — a Roman Catholic high school in Englewood, New Jersey.[49][50] 
He was offered the position by the school's new head coach, Lombardi's 
former Fordham teammate, quarterback Andy Palau. Palau had just taken over 
the head coaching position from another Fordham teammate, Nat Pierce (left 
guard), who had accepted an assistant coach's job back at Fordham. In addition 
to coaching, Lombardi, age 26, also taught Latin, chemistry, and physics 
for an annual salary of under $1,000 at the high school.[51][note 4] Andy 
Palau left for Fordham in 1942 and Lombardi became the head coach at St. 
Cecilia. Lombardi stayed a total of eight years, five as head coach. In 
1943, St. Cecilia's was recognized as the top football team in the nation, 
in large part based on their victory over Brooklyn Prep, a Jesuit school 
considered one of the best teams on the American eastern seaboard. Brooklyn 
Prep that season was led by senior Joe Paterno, who, like Lombardi, would 
rise to legend-status in football. He won 6 championships.[52] At St. Cecilia, 
Lombardi became the President of the Bergen County Coach's Association.[53] 
In 1947, Lombardi became the coach of freshman teams in football and basketball 
at Fordham University. The following year he served as an assistant coach 
for Fordham's varsity football team, but he was arguably the de facto head 
coach.[54] Following the 1948 football season, Lombardi accepted an assistant's 
job, at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, a position that would 
greatly influence his future coaching style. Lombardi served as offensive 
line coach[55] under legendary head coach Earl "Colonel Red" Blaik. "As 
integral as religion was to [Lombardi's] sense of self, it was not until 
he reached West Point and combined his spiritual discipline with Blaik's 
military discipline that his coaching persona began to take its mature 
form."[56] Blaik's emphasis on execution[57] would become a trademark of 
Lombardi's coaching.[58] Lombardi coached at West Point for five seasons, 
with varying results. The 1949 and 1950 seasons were successful. But the 
1951 and 1952 seasons were not successful due to the aftermath of a cadet 
cribbing scandal (a violation of the Cadet Honor Code[59]) which was revealed 
in the spring of 1951. As a result, 43 of 45 members of the varsity football 
team were discharged by administrative order.[60] "Decades later, looking 
back on his rise, Lombardi came to regard ..." Blaik's decision not to 
resign "... as a pivotal moment in his [own] career" — it taught him perseverance.[61] 
After the seasons of 1951 and 1952 not much was expected from the 1953 
team as it had also lost six players due to academic failure. The team 
of 1953 however did go on to be 7-1-1, as Lombardi had a bigger role than 
ever in coaching the team.[62] Following these five seasons at Army, Lombardi 
accepted an assistant coaching position with the New York Giants. In 1954, 
Lombardi, age 41, began his NFL career with the New York Giants. He accepted 
a job that would later become known as the offensive coordinator position 
under new head coach Jim Lee Howell.[63] The Giants had finished the previous 
season under 23-year coach Steve Owen with a 3–9 record. By the third season, 
Lombardi, along with the defensive coordinator, former All-Pro cornerback 
turned coach Tom Landry, turned the squad into a championship team, defeating 
the Chicago Bears 47–7 for the league title in 1956. "Howell readily acknowledged 
the talents of Lombardi and Landry, and joked self-deprecatingly, that 
his main function was to make sure the footballs had air in them."[64] 
At points in his tenure as an assistant coach at West Point, and as an 
assistant coach with the Giants, Lombardi worried that he was unable to 
land a head coaching job due to prejudice against his Italian heritage,[65] 
especially with respect to Southern colleges.[66] Howell wrote numerous 
recommendations for Lombardi to aid Vince in obtaining a head coaching 
position. Lombardi applied for head coaching positions at Wake Forest,[67] 
Notre Dame and other universities and, in some cases, never received a 
reply.[66] In New York, Lombardi introduced the strategy of rule blocking 
to the NFL.[citation needed] In rule blocking, the offensive lineman would 
block an area, and not necessarily a particular defensive player, as was 
the norm up to that time.[68] The running back then was expected to run 
toward any hole that was created. Lombardi referred to this as running 
to daylight. For the 1958 NFL season, the Packers, with five future hall 
of famers playing on the team,[69][note 5] finished with a record of 1–10–1,[69] 
the worst in Packer history.[70] The players were dispirited,[71] the Packer 
shareholders were disheartened, and the Green Bay community was enraged. 
The angst in Green Bay extended to the NFL as a whole, as the financial 
viability and the very existence of the Green Bay Packer franchise were 
in jeopardy. On February 2, 1959, Vince Lombardi accepted the position 
of head coach and general manager of the Green Bay Packers.[72] Lombardi 
created punishing training regimens and expected absolute dedication and 
effort from his players. The 1959 Packers were an immediate improvement, 
finishing at 7–5. Rookie head coach Lombardi was named Coach of the Year.[73] 
The fans appreciated what Lombardi was trying to do, and responded by selling 
out every game for the 1960 season. Every Packers home game—preseason, 
regular season and playoffs—has been sold out ever since. In his second 
year, Green Bay won the NFL Western Conference for the first time since 
1944. This victory, along with his well-known religious convictions[74] 
led the Green Bay community to anointing him with the nickname "The Pope".[74] 
Lombardi led the Packers to the 1960 NFL Championship Game against the 
Philadelphia Eagles. Prior to the championship game, Lombardi met with 
Wellington Mara and advised him that he would not take the Giants' head 
coaching job, which was initially offered after the end of the 1959 season.[75] 
In the final play of the game, in a drive that would have won it, the Packers 
were stopped a few yards from the goal line. Lombardi had suffered his 
first, and his only ever, championship game loss. After the game, and after 
the press corps had left the locker room, Lombardi told his team, "This 
will never happen again. You will never lose another championship."[76] 
In later years as coach of the Packers, Lombardi made it a point to admonish 
his running backs if they failed to score from one yard out, then he would 
consider it a personal affront to him and he would seek retribution.[77] 
He would coach the Packers to win their next nine post-season games, a 
record streak not matched or broken until Bill Belichick won 10 in a row 
from 2002 to 2006.[78] The Packers would defeat the Giants for the NFL 
title in 1961 (37–0 in Green Bay) and 1962 (16–7 at Yankee Stadium), marking 
the first two of their five titles in Lombardi's seven years. After the 
1962 championship win, President John F. Kennedy called Lombardi and asked 
him if he would, "come back to Army and coach again"; Kennedy received 
Lombardi's tacit denial of the request.[79] His only other post-season 
loss occurred to the St. Louis Cardinals in the Playoff Bowl (3rd place 
game) after the 1964 season (officially classified as an exhibition game).[80] 
Including postseason but excluding exhibition games, Lombardi went on to 
compile a 105–35–6 (.740 winning percent) record as head coach, and he 
never suffered a losing season.[81] He led the Packers to three consecutive 
NFL championships — in 1965, 1966, and 1967 — a feat accomplished only 
once before in the history of the league (by Curly Lambeau, co-founder 
of the Packers, who coached the team to their first three straight NFL 
Championships in 1929, 1930, and 1931). At the conclusion of the 1966 and 
1967 seasons, Lombardi's Packers would go on to win the first two Super 
Bowls.[82][83][84] Lombardi coached the Green Bay Packers to championships 
in five of seven seasons.[85] As coach of the Packers, Lombardi converted 
Notre Dame quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Paul Hornung to a full-time 
halfback. Lombardi also designed a play for Jim Taylor, the Green Bay fullback—both 
guards, Jerry Kramer and Fuzzy Thurston, pulled to the outside and blocked 
downfield while Taylor would "run to daylight" — i.e., wherever the defenders 
weren't. This was a play that he had originally developed with the Giants 
for Frank Gifford. It soon became known as the "Lombardi sweep," though 
Lombardi openly admitted it was based on an old single wing concept. Lombardi's 
Packers hosted the Dallas Cowboys in Green Bay on December 31, 1967 in 
the NFL Championship Game of 1967.[86] This became known as the "Ice Bowl" 
because of the −13 °F game time temperature. Lombardi had a heating coil 
underneath the field but on this day it was not functioning, some people 
believe that he turned it off on purpose. With 16 seconds left in the game 
and down by 3 points, the Packers called their final time-out. It was 3rd 
and goal on the Dallas 2 foot line.[87] In the huddle, with the game on 
the line, Starr asked Kramer whether he could get enough traction on the 
icy turf for a wedge play and Kramer responded with an unequivocal yes.[88] 
Quarterback Bart Starr came over to Lombardi on the sidelines to discuss 
the last play and told him he wanted to run a 31 wedge, but with him keeping 
the ball. Lombardi told Starr to 'Run it! And let's get the hell out of 
here!' Lombardi was asked by Pat Peppler what play Starr would call, to 
which Lombardi replied, 'Damned if I know.'[89] Starr returned to the huddle 
and called a Brown right 31 Wedge,[90] but with him keeping the ball.[91][92] 
Kramer blocked Jethro Pugh low and Ken Bowman hit Pugh high as Starr followed 
them into the end zone for the Packer lead and eventual victory. Lombardi 
stepped down as head coach of the Packers following the 1967 NFL season, 
staying on as the team's general manager for 1968. He handed off the head 
coaching position to Phil Bengtson, a longtime assistant, but the Packers 
finished at 6–7–1 and out of the four team NFL playoffs. In 1969, Lombardi 
became head coach and general manager of the Washington Redskins. The 'Skins 
would finish with a record of 7–5–2, their first winning record in 14 years. 
The foundation Lombardi laid was the groundwork for Washington's early 
1970s success under former Los Angeles Rams Coach George Allen. In the 
fall of 1934 Lombardi's roommate Jim Lawlor introduced him to his cousin's 
relative, Marie Planitz.[93] When Marie announced her ardent desire to 
marry Lombardi, her father told her that he did not want his daughter marrying 
an Italian,[94] a prejudice against his heritage he would face more than 
once in his life.[95][96] Lombardi and Marie wed, nonetheless, on August 
31, 1940.[97] "He seemed preoccupied with football even on their honeymoon, 
and cut it short to get back to Englewood ... 'I wasn't married to him 
more than one week', she later related, 'when I said to myself, Marie Planitz, 
you've made the greatest mistake of your life.'"[97] Marie miscarried her 
first child with Lombardi. The terrible effect this had on Marie caused 
her to turn to heavy drinking,[98] a problem she would deal with on more 
than one occasion in her life.[99] On April 27, 1942, their son, Vincent 
Harold Lombardi (Vince Jr.), was born[100] and on February 13, 1947, their 
daughter Susan was born.[101] Lombardi's perfectionism,[82][102] authoritarian 
nature[103] and temper,[97] instilled in his wife a masterful ability to 
verbally assault and demean Lombardi when he verbally abused her.[38] His 
children were not immune from his yelling. When Lombardi had not lost his 
temper, he would often be reticent and aloof.[104] Lombardi's grandson, 
Joe Lombardi, was named the offensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions 
in January 2014.[105] He was relieved of this position midway through the 
2015 season. Lombardi was previously quarterbacks coach for the New Orleans 
Saints. In the 2009 season, he helped lead the Saints to win the trophy 
bearing his grandfather's name and Drew Brees to win a Super Bowl MVP award.[106] 
Lombardi did not serve in WWII though he was in his late 20s when WWII 
broke out. He obtained a series of deferments: his first was a 2-A due 
to his teaching occupation; in 1943, he obtained a second deferment due 
to parenthood (3-A); and his final deferment was labelled a 4-A and given 
in 1944.[107] The three constants throughout Lombardi's life were sports, 
particularly football, family and religion.[108] His father was a daily 
communicant throughout his life[15] and his mother's favorite picture of 
him as a child was on his Confirmation.[16] When Lombardi was 12, on Easter 
Sunday while serving as an altar boy, "... amid the color and pageantry 
scarlet and white vestments, golden cross, scepters, the wafers and wine, 
body and blood ... that the inspiration came to him that he should become 
a priest ...",[16] which when his mother, Matty, got wind of, she bragged 
about it to her neighbors.[24] Lombardi attended Mass on a daily basis 
throughout his life.[109] During his tenure at St. Cecilia, Lombardi attended 
Mass every day and "prayed for calm and control: of his temper and ..." 
his wife's drinking. When Lombardi became head coach of football in 1942, 
he would lead his team to Sunday Mass before each home game.[110] At St. 
Cecilia, Lombardi shared an office with Father Tim Moore wherein it was 
not unusual for Lombardi to interrupt a conversation and request to go 
to Confession and which Father Tim would oblige him right in the office.[111] 
During his stay at Green Bay, Lombardi once emerged from his office and 
appeared before his secretary, Ruth McKloskey, wearing "... all these priest 
robes on, and he had a miter with a tassel, everything."[112] Each day 
on his way to work for the Green Bay Packers, Lombardi would stop at St. 
Willebrord Church and "offer a prayer in case of unexpected death: 'My 
God, if I am to die today, or suddenly at any time, I wish to receive this 
Communion as my viaticum ...'".[113] He regularly attended Sunday Mass 
at Resurrection Church in the Allouez neighborhood of Green Bay's southeast 
side, always sitting with his wife in the middle of the ninth pew.[114] 
On the morning of the dedication of Lombardi Avenue, Lombardi remarked 
to his 37-member entourage that he was pleased to have gotten them all 
up to attend morning Mass.[115] Lombardi was also a 4th degree in the Knights 
of Columbus.[citation needed] In 1960, on at least one team, a color barrier 
still existed in the NFL.[116][117] But Jack Vainisi, the Scouting Director 
for the Packers,[81] and Lombardi were determined "to ignore the prejudices 
then prevalent in most NFL front offices in their search for the most talented 
players."[118] Lombardi explained his views by saying that he "... viewed 
his players as neither black nor white, but Packer green".[119] Among professional 
football head coaches, Lombardi's view on discrimination was not de rigueur 
in the midst of the American civil rights movement.[120] An interracial 
relationship between one of the Packer rookies and a young woman was brought 
to the attention of Lombardi by Packer veterans in his first training camp 
in Green Bay.[121] The next day at training camp, Lombardi, who had a zero 
tolerance policy towards racism, responded by warning his team that if 
any player exhibited prejudice, in any manner, then that player would be 
thrown off the team. Lombardi, who was vehemently opposed to Jim Crow discrimination, 
let it be known to all Green Bay establishments that if they did not accommodate 
his black players equally as well as his white players, then that business 
would be off-limits to the entire team.[122] Before the start of the 1960 
regular season, he instituted a policy that the Packers would only lodge 
in places that accepted all his players.[123] In the all-white Oneida Golf 
and Riding Country club in Green Bay, of which Lombardi was a member, Lombardi 
demanded that he should be allowed to choose a Native American caddy, even 
if white caddies were available.[124] Lombardi's view on racial matters 
was a result of his religious faith and the prejudice he had experienced 
as an Italian-American.[125] "One Packer famously said that Lombardi 'treats 
us all the same -- like dogs.' To the coach, there were no gay dogs or 
straight dogs; there were just Packers who had one goal: to play their 
best and win." While Lombardi was known to be volatile and terse with players 
during practices and games, he insisted on unconditional respect for everyone 
in his organization.[127] Demanding "Nothing But Acceptance" from players 
and coaches toward all people, Lombardi would immediately terminate a coach 
or release a player should they insult the sexual orientation of gay players 
and front office staff.[128] According to Lombardi biographer, Pulitzer 
Prize winning writer David Maraniss, if he caught a coach "discriminating 
against a player thought to be gay, he'd be fired."[129] Richard Nicholls, 
the lifelong partner of Lombardi's younger brother, Hal, stated, "Vin was 
always fair in how he treated everybody...a great man who accepted people 
at face value for what they were, and didn't judge anybody. He just wanted 
you to do the job."[130] In Washington, Lombardi's assistant general manager, 
David Slatterly, was gay, as was PR director Joe Blair, who was described 
as Lombardi's "right-hand man."[131] According to son Vince Lombardi, Jr., 
"He saw everyone as equals, and I think having a gay brother (Hal) was 
a big factor in his approach...I think my father would've felt, 'I hope 
I've created an atmosphere in the locker room where this would not be an 
issue at all. And if you do have an issue, the problem will be yours because 
my locker room will tolerate nothing but acceptance.'"[130] Upon his arrival 
in Washington, Lombardi was aware of tight end Jerry Smith's sexual orientation.[132] 
“Lombardi protected and loved Jerry,” said former teammate Dave Kopay.[133] 
Lombardi brought Smith into his office and told him that his sexual orientation 
would never be an issue as long as he was coaching the Redskins; Smith 
would be judged solely on his on-the-field performance and contribution 
to the team's success.[134] Under Lombardi's leadership Smith flourished, 
becoming an integral part of Lombardi's offense, and was voted a First 
Team All-Pro for the first time in his career, which was also Lombardi's 
only season as Redskin head coach.[135] Lombardi invited other gay players 
to training camp, and would privately hope they would prove they could 
earn a spot on the team.[136] At the Washington Redskins training camp 
in 1969, Ray McDonald was a gay player, with sub-par skills,[137] who was 
trying to make the Redskin roster again,[citation needed] but this time 
with Lombardi as the Redskins' new head coach. True to his word, Lombardi 
told running back coach, George Dickson,[138] 'I want you to get on McDonald 
and work on him and work on him – and if I hear one of you people make 
reference to his manhood, you'll be out of here before your ass hits the 
ground.'[139] As early as 1967, Lombardi had suffered from digestive tract 
problems, and he had refused his doctor's request for him to undergo a 
proctoscopic exam.[140] On June 24, 1970, Lombardi was admitted to Georgetown 
University Hospital, and tests "revealed anaplastic carcinoma in the rectal 
area of his colon, a fast-growing malignant cancer in which the cells barely 
resemble their normal appearance."[141] On July 27, Lombardi was readmitted 
to Georgetown and exploratory surgery found that the cancer was terminal.[142] 
Lombardi, with Marie at his side, received family, friends, clergy, players, 
and former players at his hospital bedside.[143] He received a phone call 
from President Nixon telling Lombardi that all of America was behind him, 
to which Lombardi replied that he would never give up his fight against 
his illness.[144] On his deathbed, Lombardi told Father Tim that he was 
not afraid to die, but that he regretted he could not have accomplished 
more in his life.[145] Lombardi died in Washington, D.C. at 7:12 a.m. on 
September 3, 1970. He was 57.[146] He was surrounded by his wife, parents, 
two children, and six grandchildren. On September 7, the funeral was held 
at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan. Approximately 1,500 people[147] 
lined Fifth Avenue, and the avenue was closed to traffic between 39th and 
50th Street. Terence Cardinal Cooke delivered the eulogy. In attendance 
were team owners, Commissioner Pete Rozelle, past and present members of 
the Packers, Redskins, and Giants, former students from Saints, colleagues 
and players from West Point, and classmates from Fordham University, including 
the remaining Seven Blocks of Granite.[note 6][148] Lombardi was interred 
in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Middletown Township, New Jersey.[149] In 1968, 
Lombardi starred in a half-hour motivational film titled Second Effort, 
that has been called "The best-selling training film of all time".[150][151] 
On December 14, 1973, ABC aired Legend in Granite starring Ernest Borgnine 
as Vince. The biographical TV drama focused mostly on his first two years 
as Packers head coach (1959–1960).[152] The Vince Lombardi Service Area 
on the New Jersey Turnpike is a fitting tribute to the man who worked in 
the Garden State. The high school in the 1980 movie Rock 'n' Roll High 
School was named after Vince Lombardi. In 1986, the Canadian TV station 
CHCH aired the TV movie Lombardi: I Am Not a Legend starring Robert Knuckle 
in the title role that depicted Lombardi's life up until the NFL.[153] 
In 1996, Nike aired several commercials featuring Jerry Stiller as the 
ghost of Lombardi. ESPN produced the 2005 TV movie Code Breakers that depicted 
the West Point cheating scandal and its effect on the football program. 
Richard Zeppieri was cast as Assistant Coach Vince Lombardi.[154] A play 
titled Lombardi opened on Broadway at the Circle in the Square Theatre 
in New York City in October 2010, following an out-of-town tryout at the 
Mahaiwe Theater in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. The production starred 
Dan Lauria as Lombardi and Judith Light as his wife, Marie. The play received 
positive reviews, as did Lauria's performance.[155] NFL Films and HBO produced 
a film about Lombardi that debuted Saturday, December 11, 2010.[156] Sources:[81]
