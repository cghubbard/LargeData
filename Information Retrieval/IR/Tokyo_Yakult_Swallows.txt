Nippon Professional Baseball (1950–present) The Tokyo Yakult Swallows are 
a professional baseball team in Nippon Professional Baseball's Central 
League. The Swallows are named after their corporate owners, the Yakult 
Corporation. From 1950 to 1965, the team was owned by the former Japanese 
National Railways (known as Kokutetsu (国鉄) in Japanese) and called the 
Kokutetsu Swallows; the team was then owned by the newspaper Sankei Shimbun 
from 1965 to 1968 and called the Sankei Atoms. Yakult purchased the team 
in 1970 and restored its original Swallows name in 1974. Then it was renamed 
the Tokyo Yakult Swallows in 2006. The franchise was established for the 
first time in 1950 when the team was created by the owners of former Japanese 
National Railways. The team name was decided to be the Kokutetsu Swallows. 
The team never finished with a winning record in the entire decade of the 
1950s. In 1961, the team ended up being third in the league for first time 
in their team history. Pitcher Masaichi Kaneda, nicknamed "The Emperor", 
starred for the team during this era and was the league's most dominant 
pitcher. Kaneda holds numerous career records in the Japanese leagues. 
For the Swallows, he went 14 straight seasons with at least 20 wins, led 
the league in strikeouts 10 times, wins three times, ERA three times, and 
won the Eiji Sawamura Award three times. Kaneda pitched for the Swallows 
from 1950 to 1964. The team won its first Japan Series championship in 
1978. In 1990, Katsuya Nomura became the new manager of Swallows, making 
drastic changes in the team. Although his first year with the Swallows 
resulted in them finishing in fifth place, the Swallows improved to third 
in the league the next year for the first time since 1980. From 1992 to 
2001, the team won five Central League championships, prevailing in the 
Japan Series in 1993, 1995, 1997, and 2001. (Nomura managed the team to 
the first three of those championships.) In 2006, Tokyo was added to the 
team name, resulting in the team name of Tokyo Yakult Swallows, and the 
logo of Tokyo was added to the uniform for the first time since the Kokutetsu 
era. The team maintained a winning percentage of .500, and ended up in 
third place in the league. 2011 was an impressive year for the Swallows. 
In April, the Swallows topped the Central League and kept 1st place until 
September when the Chunichi Dragons climbed to win in the pennant race, 
ultimately leaving the Swallows in 2nd place in the Central League. The 
Swallows entered the Climax Series in 2009, and faced the Yomiuri Giants 
for the stage 1, which ultimately resulted in a 2–1 victory. Swallows advanced 
for their first time into stage 2 and faced the defending Central League 
champions, the Chunichi Dragons. The Swallows eventually lost against the 
Dragons by 2-4, ending their postseason. At the end of season, Hirotoshi 
Ishii retired from the team. In 2012, Norichika Aoki was posted to the 
Milwaukee Brewers. On 19 March 2012, the main office was moved to Kita-Aoyama 
which is located close to the Meiji Jingu Stadium from Higashi-Shinbashi. 
Manager and Head Coach The team's mascot is a black swallow with a red 
face named Tsubakuro. He is known for his feuds with the Orix Buffaloes 
mascots. The number on the back of his uniform is "8960" as opposed to 
111/222 used by Buffalo Bull and Buffalo Bell, the Buffaloes' mascots. 
There is also a female swallow mascot named Tsubami. She wears a skirt 
and may be intended as Tsubakuro's little sister, just as Bell is Bull's
