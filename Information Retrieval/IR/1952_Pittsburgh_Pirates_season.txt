The 1952 Pittsburgh Pirates season was the team's 71st season in Major 
League Baseball, and their 66th season in the National League. The Pirates 
posted a record of 42 wins and 112 losses, their worst record since 1890, 
and one of the worst in major league history. The Pirates were led in 1952 
by 70-year-old general manager Branch Rickey and 60-year-old manager Billy 
Meyer. Meyer had led Pittsburgh to a last-place finish in the National 
League in 1950. After Rickey was installed as general manager, the Pirates 
were second-to-last in 1951. Tension was high as the two-year contract 
of their star slugger, Ralph Kiner, expired before the 1952 season. Kiner 
was the premier power hitter in baseball, having won the previous six National 
League home run titles.[2] Rickey voiced what he viewed as inconsistent 
levels of commitment by Kiner when talking to the media. Kiner received 
permission to instead negotiate directly with owner John W. Galbreath and 
agreed to a reported one-year, $90,000 contract, making him the highest-paid 
player in the National League. Kiner was signed, but the most famous Pirate 
of all, 78-year-old Hall of Fame member Honus Wagner, decided to retire 
from his part-time coaching duties with the team. His number was retired, 
and he was given a lifetime pass to Forbes Field.[3] Rickey wanted to hold 
a tryout for dozens of kids from the low minor league levels, and his plan 
was largely supported by Bing Crosby and the rest of the team's ownership. 
Rickey hired his former scout and coach Clyde Sukeforth, who had scouted 
Jackie Robinson for Rickey in the 1940s. Several top young prospects, like 
Vern Law and Danny O'Connell, were called to military service for the Korean 
War, and the more experienced Danny Murtaugh retired to accept a minor 
league managing position. Expectations were high for 23-year-old outfielder 
Gus Bell to support Kiner in the lineup. Murry Dickson, who had won 21 
games in 1951, nearly a third of the entire team's win total, was once 
again expected to be the anchor of the pitching rotation.[3] The Pirates 
struggled throughout spring training in 1952.[5] Gus Bell missed training 
time due to family-related car problems and illness and was sent to the 
minor leagues.[3] Towards the end of spring training, pitcher Bill Werle 
was suspended indefinitely and fined $500, only the third player fined 
in over two decades of Billy Meyer's managing career.[6] Werle professed 
his innocence and was reinstated before Opening Day but he was traded to 
the St. Louis Cardinals two weeks later.[7] Thirteen rookies made the Pirates' 
Opening Day roster, including four teenagers: Bobby Del Greco, Tony Bartirome, 
Jim Waugh and Lee Walls.[3] After four games, Pittsburgh's record was 2–2 
but they quickly tumbled to the bottom of the majors by losing 16 of their 
next 17 games.[8] The early two-game winning streak matched the longest 
they would see all year.[9] Their top three pitchers combined to win just 
one of their first nine games started.[10] Kiner's hitting was affected 
by the lack of support as well as back problems and his batting average 
was under .220 several weeks into the season. Kiner's difficulties and 
a club earned run average over five resulted in a 5–28 record in mid-May.[11] 
Gus Bell returned from the minors on May 12 and hit for some power but 
Kiner hit only .241 with 13 home runs and 31 RBIs in the first half which 
ended with Pittsburgh at 21–59.[11][12] 21-year-old Dick Groat was one 
of the Pirates' few bright spots in the first half with four hits in his 
first three games, but others went into long slumps like Jack Merson's 
0-for-35, Clyde McCullough's 0-for-24 and Tony Bartirome's 0-for-29.[11] 
The second half soon resembled the first with a 2–11 stretch in mid-July.[8] 
They were mathematically eliminated from pennant contention on August 6 
with more than six weeks left to play.[9] In early August, Pittsburgh called 
up 20-year-old pitcher Ron Necciai from the minors. Necciai had pitched 
a legendary 27-strikeout game in the minors but gave up five runs in his 
first inning in the majors.[13] Necciai not only finished the season with 
poor numbers but also injured his arm and never again pitched in the majors.[11] 
Branch Rickey's youth movement, derided as "Operation Peach Fuzz", continued 
unabated.[10] On August 20, the average age of Pittsburgh's starting lineup 
was only 23 with Kiner and Garagiola being the only non-rookies.[13] On 
September 5, pitcher Bill Bell made his major league debut at age 18.[14] 
Including Bell, seven of the eight youngest players in the National League 
in 1952 were Pittsburgh Pirates.[15] "Rickey's Dinks", as they were sometimes 
called, were not only young but small. In one game, the entire infield 
was less than six feet tall.[10] The Pirates difficulties reached off the 
field as well. Ralph Kiner, enduring his worst season to-date, received 
a death threat in an attempt to extort $6,200. Rather than pay, he contacted 
the authorities and was kept under guard for a time.[11] Financially, Pittsburgh's 
attendance was the lowest since World War II, falling more than 30% short 
of the one million budgeted.[9] Branch Rickey sometimes saved money by 
sending only 21 players on road trips.[11] The final losses for the franchise, 
including minor leagues and bonuses, were $800,000.[9] Billy Meyer resigned 
as manager on September 27, the second-to-last day of the season.[11] When 
the season mercifully ended, Pittsburgh's final record was 42–112. The 
winning percentage and number of losses were the worst for the franchise 
since the 1890 season (which was greatly affected by the inclusion of the 
Players' League) and the worst for any franchise since the 1935 Boston 
Braves.[16][17] Since 1952, the only non-expansion team to finish worse 
has been the 2003 Detroit Tigers.[17] A few individuals came away with 
positive notes. A late-season home run surge by Ralph Kiner brought him 
his seventh consecutive home run championship (he finished tied with Hank 
Sauer with 37 on the year). It was also his last.[11] Dick Groat finished 
at .284 and was third in National League Rookie of the Year voting.[11][18] 
Joe Garagiola logged the most playing time of his career and hit .273 with 
a career-high 54 RBIs, third most on the team behind only Kiner and Gus 
Bell.[11] On the flipside, teenagers Tony Bartirome and Bobby Del Greco 
were regulars but neither hit over .220. Seven other players had at least 
40 at-bats but hit under .200.[11] Kiner's home run total (37) was more 
than the next four highest on the team combined (16, 8, 7, 5). As a team, 
Pittsburgh was last in the National League in runs, hits, doubles, triples, 
home runs, RBIs, batting average, slugging percentage, complete games, 
ERA, walks allowed, home runs allowed, fielding percentage and errors committed.[9][11] 
Murry Dickson, who won 21 games in 1951, lost 20 games in 1952, going 14–20. 
Only three other pitchers won more than two games.[11] The pitching staff 
walked 615 opposing batters while striking out only 564, with 16 different 
players starting a game during the season.[19] Among their young players, 
only Jim Waugh – the youngest – played in the majors again before 1955. 
Waugh played in 1953, his last year; Ron Necciai and Tony Bartirome never 
played in the majors after 1952; Bill Bell pitched one inning in 1955, 
his last; and Bobby Del Greco, Lee Walls and Ron Kline had longer careers 
but not until several years later. Dick Groat and pitcher Bob Friend were 
the only players to endure the 1952 season who also played with the 1960 
World Series champion Pirates. The failure of the 1952 Pirates was the 
source of several anecdotes and side-stories. Pittsburgh Press writer Len 
Biederman recalled an earlier humorous practice by giving Dick Groat a 
dime while he was in an 0-for-19 slump. When Groat broke out of the slump 
with a 5-for-5 game, Biederman gave Kiner a quarter with similar positive 
results so Biederman continued giving coins to various Pirates.[11] Joe 
Garagiola, the regular catcher for the 1952 Pirates, frequently used the 
team's struggles in his later career as a baseball sportscaster with lines 
like, "They talk about Pearl Harbor being something; they should have seen 
the 1952 Pittsburgh Pirates" and "In an eight-team league, we should've 
finished ninth."[5][11] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Coaches
