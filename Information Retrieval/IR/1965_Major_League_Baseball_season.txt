In the 1965 Major League Baseball season, the Houston Colt .45s became 
the Astros, as they moved from Colts Stadium to the new Astrodome, becoming 
the first team to play their home games indoors, rather than outdoors. 
It was also the final season for the Braves in Milwaukee, before relocating 
to Atlanta for the 1966 season. The Los Angeles Angels officially changed 
their name to California Angels in advance of their pending 1966 move to 
a new stadium in Anaheim. 1 National League Triple Crown Pitching Winner
