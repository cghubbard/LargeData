Winter Haven is a city in Polk County, Florida, United States. The population 
was 33,874 at the 2010 census. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 
estimates, the city had a population of 37,689, making it the second most 
populated city in Polk County. It is a principal city of the Lakeland-Winter 
Haven, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Timucua and the Calusa 
were the earliest known inhabitants of the land that would become Winter 
Haven. Both of these groups were deeply impacted, by war and disease, from 
the Spanish conquest of Florida in the early 1500s. The Timucua were particularly 
affected by the expedition of Hernando de Soto. By the 19th century, both 
these groups no longer existed. During these expeditions, the Spanish explorers 
claimed the entire peninsula of Florida for the Spanish monarchy In the 
19th century, the Creek and the Seminole were known to live and hunt in 
this area.[6] During the Seminole Wars, the Seminole leader, Chipco, and 
his followers were known to live in the Winter Haven area. Several small 
skirmishes during the war were fought in and around Winter Haven.[7] In 
1819, after the signing of the Adams-Onís Treaty, the United States gained 
control of Florida. The first American or European settlers in the area 
were encouraged to settle here by the Armed Occupation Act of 1842.[6] 
This act was specifically created to increase the white population in the 
area as a way to weaken the Native Americans populations after the Second 
Seminole War. It created generous land grants and other incentives for 
settlers who were willing to defend themselves against the native populations, 
hence the name of the act. During the 1840s and 1850s, the United States 
government conducted the first surveys of the area. Henry Washington conducted 
the first survey of the area in 1843. In 1849, Dr. John Westcott completed 
an extensive survey of the area, including mapping many of the local lakes.[6] 
The first maps of the area were published by the United States government 
in 1854.[6] In 1883, Col. Henry Haines working for Henry Plant and the 
Plant System, successfully built the first railroad across Polk County, 
passing just north of Winter Haven. Lake Haines, in Winter Haven, was named 
after Col. Haines. The arrival of the railroad created the first real growth 
in area.[8] The area was platted in 1884 and would first be known as Harris 
Corners.[9] This name was in reference to F.A.K. Harris, who opened the 
first mercantile store in the area around this time.[9] The name Winter 
Haven was later suggested, in reference to the area's pleasant climate.[9] 
By the end of the century, the population grew to around 400 and in 1911, 
and the City of Winter Haven was incorporated. The Chain of Lakes canals 
were begun in 1915. The first Florida boom took place in the 1920s as towns 
sprang up all over the peninsula. Florida's potential as a place to live 
and a place to visit was first realized in the 1920s, but the Great Depression 
slowed growth in Florida until after World War II. Winter Haven Hospital 
was founded in 1926 and has been in the city ever since. During this period, 
the population of Winter Haven began to grow substantially. Many beautiful 
single-family homes were built in Winter Haven at this time in the colonial 
revival style. Over 50 these homes are on the National Register of Historic 
Places today. They are noted for their architectural style and grace. Most 
of these historic homes are located in the Interlaken neighborhood. There 
are four historic districts in Winter Haven. They are Interlaken, Pope 
Avenue, Winter Haven Heights, and the downtown area. In 1930, George W. 
Jenkins opened the first Publix supermarket in Winter Haven.[10] His second 
store and the first stand-alone Publix store, was a 27 ft by 65 ft building 
at 199 West Central Avenue, opened in 1935, which exists today as the Regenerations 
thrift store.[10][11][12] During the 1930s and 1940s, citrus magnate, John 
A. Snively operated one of the largest fruit packing plants in the world 
in Winter Haven.[13] Another defining event in Winter Haven was the opening 
of Cypress Gardens in 1936 by Dick Pope, Sr. and his wife, Julie Pope. 
They first got the idea for the park from a Good Housekeeping magazine 
that they were reading. Together they created America's first theme park, 
and by the 1950s, Cypress Gardens was nationally famous. It featured a 
beautiful botanical garden, water skiing shows, and a staff of southern 
belles. Many famous celebrities of that time visited the park, including 
Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Betty Grable, and King Hussein of Jordan. 
In the 1980s, the Anheuser-Busch corporation purchased the park. They continued 
to operate the park until 1995. After that, the park struggled, finally 
closing for good in 2009. On January 21, 2010, the site of Cypress Gardens 
was formally announced as the selected location for Legoland Florida,[14] 
which opened on October 15, 2011. Legoland Florida is a state-of-the-art, 
world-class theme park that successfully retained some of the tradition 
and history of the original site, including part of the original botanical 
garden and a water ski show.[15] Winter Haven featured many buildings designed 
by Gene Leedy, one of the founders of the Sarasota School of Architecture. 
Regency Medical Center, which is Winter Haven Hospital's women's hospital, 
was built in 1987.[16] The Orange Dome, located near the corner of Cypress 
Gardens Blvd and US Hwy 17, was built in 1964. For 48 years, it hosted 
the annual Citrus Festival and other civic affairs. In February 2012, the 
Orange Dome was demolished to make way for The Landings, a proposed $150 
million mixed-use development that was intended to include high-end retail 
stores, restaurants, hotels, apartments and a new movie theater to be built 
at the Chain of Lakes Complex.[17] However, after the construction of three 
fast food chain stores, the project collapsed. Currently, the developer 
and the city are in negotiations to determine the future of the site.[18] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area 
of 25.4 square miles (66 km2). 17.7 square miles (46 km2) of it is land 
and 7.7 square miles (20 km2) of it (30.45%) is water. Winter Haven is 
located within the Central Florida Highlands area of the Atlantic coastal 
plain with a terrain consisting of flatland interspersed with gently rolling 
hills.[19] It has an average elevation of 146 feet (45 m) above sea-level.[20] 
The city is located at the headwaters of the Peace River (Florida).[21] 
Winter Haven has 50 lakes within its borders,[22] including its famous 
Chain of Lakes. The lakes are by far the city's most distinctive feature. 
Winter Haven bills itself as "The Chain of Lakes City". The city has two 
prominent chains of lakes. The northern chain has 9 lakes interconnected 
by a series of canals.[23] The southern chain is larger, with 16 lakes 
interconnected by a series of canals. The southern chain has several prominent 
lakes, including Lake Eloise, Lake Howard, and Lake Lulu.[23] In 2011, 
after 6 years of construction and political in-fighting, Winter Haven opened 
a canal lock system connecting the two chains of lakes.[24] Most of the 
lakes in Winter Haven formed in a similar fashion to sinkholes, through 
dissolving of the limestone ground. These types of lakes are called "solution 
lakes".[22] The lakes in Winter Haven teem with life, including alligators, 
bald eagles, great blue herons, and more. The Winter Haven lakes are a 
world-renowned spot for bass fishing.[20] Winter Haven is located in the 
humid subtropical zone (Köppen climate classification: Cfa).[25] The city 
gets its name from its comparative lack of colder weather. The average 
temperature is 73.2 °F (23 °C). The city averages 50.3 inches (128 cm) 
inches of rain per year.[26] The summer months of June, July, August, and 
September, which includes the height of the Atlantic hurricane season, 
are by far the rainiest time of the year. Those four months, which average 
29.7 inches (75 cm) inches of rain per year, account for more than half 
of the annual rainfall. Winters in Lakeland are dry and sunny, with mild 
temperatures with highs in the lower 70's F and lows in the lower 50's 
. Frosts occur on one or two nights per year on average. [26] As of the

sprinter, Kenneth Brokenburr[31] both grew up in Winter Haven. Four-time 
NBA all-star and Olympic gold medalist guard, Otis Birdsong, also grew 
up in Winter Haven.[32] Welterweight boxing champion, Andre Berto, is another 
famous athlete who grew up in Winter Haven. Winter Haven has many successful 
sports programs, both recreational and competitive, serving the youth in 
the community. Winter Haven High School has won several state and district 
championships in various sports, including Girls Varsity Basketball State 
Championship in 2005, 2007, and 2016. With so many lakes, Winter Haven 
is a location for fresh water fishing. The two sports for which Winter 
Haven is best known are water skiing and baseball. Winter Haven has played 
a major role in the development and growth of water skiing as a sport. 
Dick Pope, Sr. used water skiing as a way to promote his Cypress Gardens 
theme park starting in the 1930s, and water ski shows soon became a staple 
of entertainment at the park. He was also the first person to complete 
a jump on water skis, jumping over a wooden ramp in 1928, for a distance 
of 25 feet.[33] He pioneered a number of other water skiing tricks, including 
the water ski human pyramid, as part of an effort to develop his shows 
at Cypress Gardens. His son, Dick Pope, Jr. popularized barefoot water 
skiing. Winter Haven is connected to 10 members of the Water Ski Hall of 
Fame, more than any other city in the world. These include Dick Pope, Sr., 
Dick Pope, Jr., and Ricky McCormick. George A. "Banana George" Blair, who 
still holds several water ski world records, was first introduced to the 
sport while visiting Winter Haven in the 1950s. Winter Haven has many lakes, 
including its famous chain of lakes, that are perfect for water skiing. 
Today, several successful ski schools, for both water skiing and barefoot 
skiing, make their home there. Everyday, all year round, water skiers can 
be seen practicing their sport on the lakes around town. Winter Haven was 
a Major League Baseball Spring Training baseball site for many years, first 
at Denison Stadium and later at the Chain of Lakes Ballpark. Many of the 
greatest baseball players in history played in Florida's Spring Training 
Grapefruit League, and passed through Winter Haven to play games, including 
Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, Willie Mays, Roberto Clemente, Johnny Bench, and 
Hank Aaron. In 1928, the Philadelphia Phillies were the first Major League 
Baseball team to call Winter Haven their spring-home.[34] The Phillies 
built Denison Stadium, which featured a large, covered wooden grandstand.[34] 
The Phillies played spring training games there until 1938. In 1940, the 
New York Giants did one season there.[34] After baseball left Denison Stadium, 
the facility was donated to the city for the benefit youth athletics. The 
stadium, with a modernized grandstand, is still in use today, frequently 
hosting football, soccer, track and field, and other events. In 1966, the 
Boston Red Sox and spring training baseball returned to Winter Haven. The 
Red Sox played in the newly built Chain of Lakes Ballpark, a state of the 
art facility at that time.[34] For 26 years, the Red Sox called Winter 
Haven their spring-home. When the Red Sox left in 1992 to move to Fort 
Myers, Florida, the city of Winter Haven was looking to attract another 
Major League Baseball team. Later that year, Hurricane Andrew devastated 
Homestead, Florida, including the spring training facilities of the Cleveland 
Indians. The Indians were in search a new spring-home, and they were a 
perfect match for Winter Haven.[35] The Indians played 16 seasons at the 
Chain of Lakes Ballpark, leaving in 2008. In 2008, after failed negotiations 
with the city to renovate Chain of Lakes Ballpark, the Indians moved into 
a brand new stadium in Goodyear, Arizona.[35] The Chain of Lakes Ballpark 
today hosts Russ Matt collegiate baseball tournament. The stadium was slated 
for demolition, and re-development into a shopping center, called the Landings, 
but those plans are currently stalled. Public schools in Winter Haven are 
operated by Polk County Public Schools. Winter Haven is part of the Tampa/St. 
Pete television market, the 13th largest in the country and part of the 
local Lakeland/Winter Haven radio market, which is the 94th largest in 
the country.[36][37] The local newspaper in Winter Haven is the News Chief
