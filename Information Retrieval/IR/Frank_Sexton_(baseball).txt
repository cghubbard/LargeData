Frank Joseph Sexton (July 8, 1872[1] – January 4, 1938) was a baseball 
player and coach. He played college baseball for Brown University from 
1890 to 1893 and for the University of Michigan in 1894. He also played 
professional baseball from 1890 to 1897, including one season in Major 
League Baseball as a pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters. He later coached 
college baseball at the University of Michigan (1896, 1901–1902), Brown 
University (1903–1910) and Harvard University (1911–1915). He also maintained 
a medical practice at Brookline, Massachusetts for many years. Sexton was 
born in Brockton, Massachusetts in either 1868 or 1872.[1] He was the son 
of Irish immigrants, John and Catherine (Comvory) Sexton.[2][3] He attended 
Brockton High School and next enrolled at Amherst College in 1888.[2] Sexton 
transferred to Brown University for the 1889–1890 academic year as a member 
of Brown's freshman class.[4] He was a senior at Brown during the 1893–1894 
academic year.[5] At Brown, Sexton "won fame both as a pitcher and fielder" 
for the school's baseball team.[6] In 1890, he won his first seven games 
at Brown, striking out 98 and allowing only 17 hits in the seven games.[7] 
He played at both pitcher, second base and center field at Brown.[7] His 
battery-mate was Fred Tenney, who became a well-known first baseman in 
Major League Baseball.[8] Sexton played on the Brown baseball team for 
four years (1890–1893) and was the team captain and coach in 1892 and 1893.[7][9] 
He graduated from Brown in 1893.[9][10] Sexton appears to have made his 
professional baseball debut in Canada, playing for the Shamrocks, a team 
sponsored by the Shamrock Athletic Association in Saint John, New Brunswick. 
According to one account of the early days of professional baseball in 
Saint John, the Shamrocks went shopping for a new pitcher in 1890: "They 
obtained the services of F.J. Sexton from Brown University. Sexton was 
a superb pitcher and received the princely salary of $150 a month"[11] 
In August 1890, Sexton helped lead the Shamrocks to the 1890 pennant with 
a 2–0 victory over the Saint John Athletic Association.[11] Sexton also 
played in the New England League for teams in Woonsocket and Pawtucket, 
Rhode Island in 1891 and 1892, and for his hometown team, the Brockton 
Shoemakers, in 1894.[12][13] During the 1895 season, Sexton played Major 
League Baseball as a pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters where he was re-united 
with his battery-mate from Brown, Fred Tenney. In his Major League debut 
on June 21, 1895, Sexton allowed only two earned runs, but the Beaneaters 
were defeated by Brooklyn by a score of 4–2. The Boston Daily Globe reported 
on Sexton's debut: "Frank J. Sexton made his first appearance with the 
Boston club and pitched a first-class game, while Tenney, his old catcher, 
handled him in fine style."[14] In his second start on June 25, 1895, Sexton 
got the win in a 5–2 victory over the New York Giants. The Boston Daily 
Globe praised Sexton's performance: "Frank Sexton faced the Giants for 
the first time, and simply toyed with them, that, too, without using much 
speed. Five singles and one double were made by the visitors, and except 
for an excusable error by Long in the first inning, the Giants would have 
left town last evening with a shutout. Tenney and Sexton worked well, the 
latter holding his man at first in fine style and pitching a cool, heady 
game. As both Tenney and Sexton can hit and run, it made Boston by all 
odds the fastest nine ever put on a ball field."[15] Sexton played in his 
final Major League game two months later on August 17, 1895. He appeared 
in seven games for Boston and compiled a record of one win and five losses 
with a 5.69 earned run average.[16] A history of the Boston baseball club 
published in 1897 noted that the club had signed several new pitchers in 
1895, seeking to overcome the weak showing of the 1894 pitching staff.[17] 
In the end, the author wrote of the new twirlers: "Stocksdale, Wilson, 
Yerrick and Sexton were more or less frosts, and were pitched in but few 
games."[18] In 1896, Sexton played for the Springfield Ponies in the Eastern 
League. He concluded his career as a professional baseball player with 
the New Bedford Whalers.[12] During the 1896 and 1897 seasons, he was one 
of the stars of the New England League, "batting well and leading in the 
fielding of the league."[6] Sexton attended the University of Michigan 
from 1894 to 1896 as a student in the Department of Medicine and Surgery.[19][20] 
In February 1895, The Michigan Alumnus announced, "F.G. [sic] Sexton, Brown 
University's crack pitcher is a student here this year and will help with 
the nine."[21] He joined the Michigan Wolverines baseball team as a pitcher 
in 1895. He pitched an 11–0 shutout against Cornell during the 1895 season.[22] 
It was at the conclusion of Michigan's 1895 baseball season that Sexton 
signed with the Boston Beaneaters. At the conclusion of his brief Major 
League Baseball career, Sexton returned to Michigan as a medical student. 
In January 1896, The Michigan Alumnus announced: "Sexton, who pitched last 
season and who was change pitcher on the Boston league team last summer, 
has been engaged as coach and will not try for his old position."[23] He 
reportedly agreed to coach the school's baseball team to meet the cost 
of his education.[22] During the 1896 season, Sexton led the Wolverines 
to a 17–4–1 record.[24] He became involved in a controversy resulting from 
an 1896 baseball game against Indiana at Bloomington. The Michigan Alumnus 
reported on the incident as follows: "In the second half of the seventh 
inning, with the score 11–11, one man out and another on base, the Indiana 
pitcher gave out and the captain noticed this and gave his umpire the tip 
to call the game, which he did, giving darkness as his reason, though the 
teams might easily have played a half hour or more longer. Sexton, who 
was umpiring for Michigan, remonstrated at this, but the Indiana team left 
the field, giving Sexton the opportunity to declare the game forfeited 
to Michigan with a score of 9 to 0."[25] After the game, an angry Indiana 
crowd closed around Sexton, and one man drew a knife on him.[25] When the 
Michigan team retreated to its hotel, the crowd followed and "again opened 
the dispute with Sexton."[25] When one of the men raised his cane to strike 
Sexton, Sexton "got him by the throat", another rushed to his help, and 
the Michigan players eventually pushed the fighters to the sidewalk.[25] 
A warrant was issued for Sexton's arrest, but he had already left for the 
train.[25] When the Indiana captain mistakenly identified one of Michigan's 
players, Holmes, as Sexton, Holmes was arrested and later sued for false 
imprisonment.[25] The Michigan Alumnus summarized the incident: "The affair 
is unfortunate and greatly to be regretted, yet few who know the facts 
will blame the Michigan men for defending themselves."[25] Sexton transferred 
to the University of Pennsylvania in 1896 and received a Doctor of Medicine 
degree in June 1898.[26] He then established a medical practice in Boston. 
While developing his practice, he played baseball in the summer of 1900 
for the "Roses", a professional baseball team in Saint John, New Brunswick.[27] 
In 1901, Sexton agreed to take time away from his medical practice to coach 
the Michigan baseball team. An article in Ann Arbor's The Weekly Bulletin 
in April 1902 noted the Wolverines' good fortune in securing Sexton's services: 
"He located near Boston, where he has a good practice now. His love for 
baseball, however, prompted him to respond to the urgent demands of the 
Michigan management for his services as coach last year, as well as for 
this year. Michigan ought to be very grateful to Dr. Sexton for thus bestowing 
his time and attention to the baseball team."[28] Sexton's contract required 
him to serve as coach from April to the beginning of June.[29] He led the 
1901 team to a 13–8 record. He returned to Michigan again as coach of the 
1902 team, which compiled a record of 8–10.[24] In June 1902, Sexton returned 
to his medical practice in North Easton, Massachusetts.[10][22] While continuing 
his medical practice, Sexton served as the baseball coach at his alma mater, 
Brown University. He was the baseball coach at Brown for eight years from 
1903 to 1910.[9] During his years as a baseball coach at Brown, his teams 
"always ranked among the best in college baseball" and finished in first 
place among the Eastern college teams in his last three years as coach.[6] 
He led the 1907 Brown baseball team to a perfect 21–0 record. In 1907, 
the Brown Alumni Monthly noted: "Very much of this year's creditable showing 
is due to Frank J. Sexton, the coach, who has a great faculty for the developing 
of new baseball material. He has been in charge of the team two years, 
and we sincerely hope he will continue in charge next season. He knows 
the men thoroughly, is intensely interested in them, and has the advantage 
of being a former Brown player himself."[10] The Evening News of Providence, 
Rhode Island also praised his work at Brown: "[T]he teams that Dr. Sexton 
has brought out at Brown always have been good ones, and ones having a 
splendid idea of how baseball should be played. Sexton has developed many 
good players for his teams, always has put the boys on their own initiative 
in the games and has been a strict disciplinarian."[7] Brown continued 
to practice medicine while coaching at Brown.[6] In December 1910, Sexton 
was hired as the baseball coach at Harvard University.[6] He was the school's 
first paid, professional baseball coach.[13][30] Upon his arrival, Sexton 
promptly instituted a new training regimen, requiring the pitchers and 
catchers to do daily work on the gymnasium apparatus for a month before 
regular practice began. Sexton told the press that the work would get their 
arms in shape "to avoid strains and other hurts when they begin throwing 
the ball around."[31] In early March 1911, Sexton signed a two-year contract 
agreeing to coach the Harvard baseball team through the 1912 season.[32] 
In Sexton's first year at Harvard, the baseball team had its best record 
since 1901, winning 17 games and losing 6.[33] Sexton coached at Harvard 
for five years from 1911 to 1915. While coaching at Harvard, Sexton drew 
attention for his innovative training techniques. In addition to his requiring 
the battery candidates to work on the gymnasium apparatus, he instituted 
a rigorous program of fall practice for the baseball team. Sexton told 
the press "there will be no let-up until they are driven to shelter by 
the cold weather."[34] In 1915, a publication known as The World's Advance 
profiled a new target device used by Sexton in the training of Harvard's 
pitching staff.[35] While Sexton was at Harvard, the baseball team played 
an annual game against the Boston Red Sox. Although the Harvard team lost 
the game each year during Sexton's tenure, the scores were relatively close: 
4–1 in 1910, 4–2 in 1911, 2–0 in 1912 and 5–0 in 1913.[36] In May 1915, 
Sexton resigned after a disagreement with the Harvard Advisory Baseball 
Committee. Sexton said that he resigned because of interference from the 
Advisory Committee with his work as coach. The dispute followed a decision 
by the committee to hire two former Harvard players as assistant coaches 
to work with the catchers and outfielders.[37] In a letter published by 
The Boston Evening Transcript, Sexton wrote that he did not agree to the 
many suggestions of the committee and concluded, "After full consideration 
of the matter discussed, I felt I could not retain my self-respect and 
esteem owing to their persistent interference and continue as coach of 
the Harvard University baseball team."[38] The Evening Transcript wrote 
that Sexton was "considered one of the most efficient in the country" and 
opined that he "has been a good coach for Harvard and has developed some 
excellent teams from very ordinary material."[38] The paper also reported 
that "the players and the college in general have been very much upset 
over the resignation of Dr. Sexton."[39] Sexton filed a lawsuit against 
the president and fellows of Harvard in May 1916 for breach of contract, 
claiming that he had not been fully paid the amounts owed under his contract.[40] 
Sexton sought $2,000 in unpaid salary and claimed that the Harvard Athletic 
Committee had interfered with his coaching and had no right to do so.[41] 
During a jury trial in March 1917, Sexton gave a demonstration of his methods, 
placing a handkerchief on the floor as home plate, and explaining the position 
from which he wanted the catcher to throw the ball. Sexton testified that 
the person who the Athletic Committee sought to impose as an assistant 
coach wanted to override his instruction to the catchers. The jury ultimately 
returned a verdict in favor of Harvard.[41] After resigning as Harvard's 
coach in 1915, Sexton returned to his medical practice. He also served 
with the rank of captain in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War 
I.[42] At the time of the 1920 Census, Sexton was living at 1032 Commonwealth 
Avenue in Brookline, Massachusetts with his wife Louise (age 44). They 
had no children at that time, and Sexton's occupation was listed as a physician 
in general practice.[3] In 1922, he continued to maintain a private medical 
practice in Brookline.[43] He died at his home in either Brookline or Brighton, 
Massachusetts in January 1938.[8][44] The cause of death was cerebral embolus 
and arteriosclerosis.[45][46] Pound sign (#) denotes interim head coach.
