Gary/Chicago International[5] Grand Calumet River Lake Michigan Adam Benjamin 
Metro Center Gary/Chicago Airport – Miller Gary (/ɡɛəri/) is a city in 
Lake County, Indiana, United States, 25 miles (40 kilometres) from downtown 
Chicago, Illinois. The population of Gary was 80,294 at the 2010 census,[6] 
making it the ninth-largest city in the state of Indiana. From the middle 
of the twentieth century to the present, Gary has experienced drastic population 
loss, falling by 55 percent from its peak of 178,320 in 1960.[7] Gary is 
adjacent to the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and borders Lake Michigan.[8][9] 
The city is known for its large steel mills, and for being the birthplace 
of The Jackson 5 music group. Gary, Indiana, was founded in 1906 by the 
United States Steel Corporation as the home for its new plant, Gary Works. 
The city was named after lawyer Elbert Henry Gary, who was the founding 
chairman of the United States Steel Corporation. Gary was the site of civil 
unrest in the Steel Strike of 1919. On October 4, 1919, a riot broke out 
on Broadway, the main north-south street through downtown Gary, between 
striking steel workers and strike breakers brought in from outside. Three 
days later, Indiana governor James P. Goodrich declared martial law. Shortly 
thereafter, over 4,000 federal troops under the command of Major General 
Leonard Wood arrived to restore order.[10] The jobs offered by the steel 
industry provided Gary with very rapid growth and a diverse population 
within the first 26 years of its founding. According to the 1920 United 
States Census, 29.7% of Gary's population at the time was classified as 
foreign-born, mostly from eastern European countries, with another 30.8% 
classified as native-born with at least one foreign-born parent. By the 
1930 United States Census, the first census in which Gary's population 
exceeded 100,000, the city was the fifth largest in Indiana and comparable 
in size to South Bend, Fort Wayne, and Evansville. At that time, 19.3% 
of the population was classified as foreign-born, with another 25.9% as 
native-born with at least one foreign-born parent. Gary was also becoming 
increasingly racially diverse, with 17.8% of the population classified 
as black, and 3.5% as Mexican. Gary's fortunes have risen and fallen with 
those of the steel industry. The growth of the steel industry brought prosperity 
to the community. Broadway was known as a commercial center for the region. 
Department stores and architecturally significant movie houses were built 
in the downtown area and the Glen Park neighborhood. In the 1960s, like 
many other American urban centers reliant on one particular industry, Gary 
entered a spiral of decline. Gary's decline was brought on by the growing 
overseas competitiveness in the steel industry, which had caused U.S. Steel 
to lay off many workers from the Gary area. As the city declined, crime 
increased.[citation needed] Rapid racial change occurred in Gary during 
the late 20th century. These population changes resulted in political change 
which reflected the racial demographics of Gary. Gary had one of the nation's 
first African-American mayors, Richard G. Hatcher, and hosted the ground-breaking 
1972 National Black Political Convention.[11] In the 1960s through the 
1980s, surrounding suburban localities such as Merrillville and Crown Point 
experienced rapid growth, including new homes and shopping districts. Owing 
to white flight, economic distress, and skyrocketing crime, many middle-class 
and affluent residents moved to other cities in the metro area such as 
Chicago and surrounding areas in Lake and Porter counties in Indiana.[citation 
needed] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Gary had the highest percentage 
of African-Americans of U.S. cities with a population of 100,000 or more, 
84% (as of the 2000 U.S. census). This no longer applies to Gary since 
the population of the city has now fallen well below 100,000 residents. 
As of 2013, the Gary Department of Redevelopment has estimated that one-third 
of all homes in the city are unoccupied and/or abandoned.[12] U.S. Steel 
continues to be a major steel producer, but with only a fraction of its 
former level of employment. While Gary has failed to reestablish a manufacturing 
base since its population peak, two casinos opened along the Gary lakeshore 
in the 1990s, although this has been aggravated by the state closing of 
Cline Avenue, an important access to the area. Today, Gary faces the difficulties 
of a rust belt city, including unemployment, decaying infrastructure, and 
low literacy and educational attainment levels. Gary has closed several 
of its schools within the last ten years. While some of the school buildings 
have been reused, most remain unused since their closing. As of 2014, Gary 
is considering closing additional schools in response to budget deficits. 
[13][14] Three-term Democratic mayor Scott King resigned from office in 
March 2006, citing a desire to return to private law practice.[15] Then-deputy 
mayor and former Calumet Township trustee Dozier T. Allen Jr., became acting 
mayor pending a formal election by local Democratic party officials. On 
April 4, 2006, local officials chose former Lake County commissioner and 
King rival Rudolph Clay to fill the remaining 21 months of King's term. 
Gary chief of police Thomas Houston was convicted of excessive force and 
abuse of authority in 2008; he died in 2010 while serving a three-year, 
five-month federal prison sentence.[16][17] In April 2011, 75-year-old 
mayor Rudy Clay announced that he would be suspending his campaign for 
reelection owing to ongoing treatments for prostate cancer. After exiting 
from the race, Clay endorsed rival Karen Freeman-Wilson, who won the Democratic 
mayoral primary in May.[18] Freeman-Wilson won election with 87 percent 
of the vote and her term began in January 2012; she is the first woman 
elected mayor in the city's history.[19] The following single properties 
and national historic districts are listed on the National Register of 
Historic Places: Downtown Gary is separated by Broadway into two separate 
communities. Originally, the City of Gary consisted of The East Side, The 
West Side, The South Side (the area south of the train tracks near 9th 
Avenue) and Glen Park, located further South along Broadway. The East Side 
was demarcated by streets named after the States in order of their acceptance 
into the Union. This area mostly contained wood-frame houses, some of the 
earliest houses and was known for its ethnic populations from Europe and 
large families. It was a beautiful area of single-family houses with repeating 
house designs alternating from one street to another, some streets looking 
very similar. Several of the East Side's most notable buildings were Memorial 
Auditorium (a large red-brick and stone civic auditorium and the site of 
numerous events, concerts and graduations) The Palace Theater, Emerson 
School, St. Luke's Church, H.C. Gordon & Sons and Goldblatt's Department 
Stores, in addition to the Fair Department Store all fronting Broadway 
at the main street that divided Gary, much like State Street and Madison 
Streets divides Chicago's North, South, West and East Sides. Lytton's, 
Hudson's ladies store, J.C. Penney and Radigan Bros Furniture Store were 
on the west side of Broadway. The West Side of Gary or West of Broadway, 
the principal commercial street, had streets named after the presidents 
of the United States in order of their election. This side of town was 
known for its masonry or brick residences, its taller and larger commercial 
buildings, including the Gary National Bank Building, Hotel Gary (now Genesis 
Towers), The Knights of Columbus Hotel & Building (now a seniors building 
fronting 5th Avenue), the Tivoli Theater (demolished), the U.S. Post Office, 
Main Library, Mercy and Methodist Hospitals and Holy Angels Cathedral and 
School. The West Side also had a secondary principal street, Fifth Avenue 
which was lined with many commercial businesses, restaurants, theaters, 
tall buildings and elegant apartment buildings. The West Side was viewed 
as more exclusive, with residences dating from about 1908 to the 1930s. 
Many of the West Side's housing were for executives of U.S. Steel and prominent 
businessmen, with several examples being 413 Tyler Street and 636 Lincoln 
Street. Many of the houses were on larger lots, with more substantial residences 
and mansions located in some areas of the West Side. There were also unique 
row houses made of poured concrete which were ganged together and known 
as "Mill Houses", as they were built to house steel mill workers. The areas 
known as Emerson and Downtown West combine to form Downtown Gary. It was 
developed in the 1920s and houses several pieces of impressive architecture, 
including one (disputed) structure, the Moe House, designed by Frank Lloyd 
Wright, and another, the Wynant House (1917), which was destroyed by fire. 
A significant number of older structures have been demolished in recent 
years, but a number of abandoned buildings remain in the downtown area, 
including historic structures like Union Station and City Methodist Church. 
A large area of the downtown neighborhood (including City Methodist) was 
devastated by fire on October 12, 1997.[20][21] Interstate 90 divides downtown 
Gary from the United States Steel plant. Ambridge Mann is located on Gary's 
near west side along 5th Avenue. Ambridge was developed for workers at 
the nearby steel plant in the 1910s and 1920s and is named after the American 
Bridge Works, which was a subsidiary of U.S. Steel. The neighborhood is 
home to a huge stock of prairie-style and art deco homes. The Gary Masonic 
Temple is located in the neighborhood along with the Ambassador apartment 
building. Located just south of Interstate 90, the neighborhood can be 
seen while passing Buchanan Street. Brunswick is located on Gary's far 
west side. The neighborhood is located just south of Interstate 90 and 
can be seen from the expressway. The Brunswick area includes the Tri-City 
Plaza shopping center on West 5th Avenue (U.S. 20). The area is south of 
the Gary Chicago International Airport. Downtown West is located in north-central 
Gary on the west side of Broadway just south of Interstate 90. The Genesis 
Convention Center, the Gary Police Department, the Lake Superior Court 
House, and the Main Branch of the Gary Public Library are located along 
5th Avenue. A new 123-unit mixed-income apartment development was built 
using a HUD Hope VI grant in 2006. The Adam Benjamin Metro Center is located 
just north of 4th Avenue. It is operated by the Gary Public Transportation 
Corporation and acts as a multimodal hub. It serves as the Downtown Gary 
South Shore train station and an intercity bus stop. Tolleston is one of 
Gary's oldest neighborhoods, predating much of the rest of the city. It 
was plated out by George Tolle in 1857, when the railroads came to the 
area. The area is to the west of Midtown and south of Ambridge Mann. Tarrytown 
is a subdivision located in Tolleston between Whitcomb Street and Clark 
Road. Black Oak is located on the far southwest side of Gary, in the vicinity 
of the Burr Street exit to the Borman Expressway. It was annexed in the 
1970s. Prior to that, Black Oak was an unincorporated area informally associated 
with Hammond, and the area has Hammond telephone numbers. The community 
was convinced (after three previously failed attempts) by Mayor Hatcher 
that its residents would benefit more from services provided by the city 
than from those provided by the county. It is the only majority-white neighborhood 
in Gary. Glen Park is located on Gary's far south side and is made up mostly 
of mid-twentieth-century houses. Glen Park is divided from the remainder 
of the city by the Borman Expressway. The northern portion of Glen Park 
is home to Gary's Gleason Park Golf Course and the campus of Indiana University 
Northwest. The far western portion of Glen Park is home to the Village 
Shopping Center. Glen Park includes the 37th Avenue corridor at Broadway. 
Midtown is located to the south of Downtown Gary, along Broadway. This 
was, traditionally, the original "black" neighborhood in the pre-1960s 
days of segregation. Aetna is located on Gary's far east side along the 
Dunes Highway. Aetna predates the city of Gary. It was a company town founded 
in 1881 by the Aetna Powder Works, an explosives company that closed with 
the end of World War I. The Town of Aetna was annexed in 1928 around the 
same time Gary annexed the Town of Miller. A building boom happened shortly 
afterward in the late 1920s and early 1930s, making Aetna home to an impressive 
collection of art deco architecture. The rest of the community was built 
throughout the 1950s after the Korean War in a series of phases. On its 
south and east, Aetna borders the undeveloped floodplain of the Little 
Calumet River. Emerson is located in north-central Gary on the east side 
of Broadway. Located just south of Interstate 90. Gary City Hall is located 
in Emerson along with the Indiana Department of Social Services building 
and the Calumet Township Trustee's office. A 6,000-seat minor league baseball 
stadium for the Gary SouthShore RailCats, U.S. Steel Yard, was constructed 
in 2002, along with contiguous commercial space and minor residential development. 
Miller Beach, also known through the years as Miller Station or just simply 
as Miller, is on Gary's far east side. Incorporated as an independent town 
in 1907, Miller was annexed by the city of Gary in 1918. Miller developed 
around the old stagecoach stop and train station known, as early as the 
1840s, as Miller's Junction. The Miller Beach area has remained somewhat 
separated from the rest of Gary both culturally and geographically. Miller 
Beach continues to be racially and economically diverse, and attracts investor 
interest due to the many year-round and summer homes within walking distance 
of Marquette Park and Lake Michigan. Prices for lakefront property are 
affordable compared with Illinois suburban communities. Lake Street provides 
shopping and dining options for Miller Beach visitors and residents. East 
Edge, a development of 28 upscale condominium, townhome, and single-family 
homes, began construction in 2007 at the eastern edge of Miller Beach along 
County Line Road, one block south of Lake Michigan.[22] The city sits on 
the southern end of the former lake bed of the prehistoric Lake Chicago, 
and also the current Lake Michigan. Most of the city's soil nearly one 
foot below the surface is pure sand. The sand beneath Gary, and on its 
beaches, is of such high quality that in years past it was mined for the 
manufacture of glass. According to the 2010 census, Gary has a total area 
of 57.18 square miles (148.10 km2), of which 49.87 square miles (129.16 km2) 
(or 87.22%) is land and 7.31 square miles (18.93 km2) (or 12.78%) is water.[3] 
Gary is "T" shaped, with its northern border on Lake Michigan. At the Northwesternmost 
section Gary borders Hammond and East Chicago. Miller Beach, its easternmost 
neighborhood, borders Lake Station and Portage. Gary's southernmost section 
borders Griffith, Hobart, Merrillville, and unincorporated Ross.[citation 
needed] Gary is about 40 miles (64 km) from the Chicago Loop.[23] Gary 
is listed by the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system as humid continental 
(Dfa). In July and August, the warmest months, high temperatures average 
84 °F (29 °C) and peak just above 100 °F (38 °C), and low temperatures 
average 63 °F (17 °C). In January and February, the coldest months, high 
temperatures average around 29 °F (−2 °C) and low temperatures average 
13 °F (−11 °C), with at least a few days of temperatures dipping below 
0 °F (−18 °C). The weather of Gary is greatly regulated by its proximity 
to Lake Michigan, as it sits at the lake's southernmost point. Weather 
varies yearly. In summer months Gary is humid. The city's yearly precipitation 
averages about 40 inches. Summer is the rainiest season. Winters vary but 
are predominantly snowy. Snowfall in Gary averages approximately 25 inches 
per year. Sometimes large blizzards hit because of "lake effect snow", 
a phenomenon whereby large amounts of water evaporated from the lake deposit 
onto the shoreline areas as inordinate amounts of snow. As of the census[4] 
of 2010, there were 80,294 people, 31,380 households, and 19,691 families 
residing in the city. The population density was 1,610.1 inhabitants per

districts serving the city and multiple charter schools located within 
the city. Most public schools in Gary are administered by the Gary Community 
School Corporation. The other public schools within the city are administered 
by Lake Ridge Schools Corporation, which is the school system for the Black 
Oak neighborhood and unincorporated Calumet Township. Due to annexation 
law, Black Oak residents retained their original school system and were 
not required to attend Gary public schools. Charter schools in Indiana, 
including those in Gary, are granted charters by one of a small number 
of chartering institutions. Indiana charter schools are generally managed 
in cooperation between the chartering institution, a local board of parents 
and community members, salaried school administrators, and a management 
company. Charter schools in Gary as of 2011 include Thea Bowman Leadership 
Academy, Charter School of the Dunes, Gary Lighthouse Charter School (formerly, 
Blessed Sacrament Parish and Grade School), and 21st Century Charter. Gary 
is home to two regional state college campuses: The Gary Public Library 
System consists of the main library at 220 West 5th Avenue and several 
branches: Brunswick Branch, W. E. B. DuBois Branch, J. F. Kennedy Branch, 
Tolleston Branch, and Woodson Branch.[31] In March 2011, the Gary Library 
Board voted to close the main library on 5th Avenue and the Tolleston branch 
in what officials said was their best economic option. The main library 
closed at the end of 2011. The building now houses a museum. [32] Lake 
County Public Library operates the Black Oak Branch at 5921 West 25th Avenue 
in the Gary city limits.[33] In addition, Indiana University Northwest 
operates the John W. Anderson Library on its campus.[34] Gary is served 
by the Gary Police Department and the Lake County Sheriff. The Gary Fire 
Department (GFD) provides fire protection and emergency medical services 
to the city of Gary.[35] The 1996 urban movie Original Gangstas was filmed 
in the city. The movie starred Gary native Fred Williamson, Pam Grier, 
Jim Brown, Richard Roundtree, and Isabel Sanford, among others. Since the 
early 2000s, Gary has experienced a surge of Hollywood filmmakers wishing 
to shoot movies in the city. In 2009, scenes for the remake of A Nightmare 
on Elm Street were filmed in Gary.[37] Scenes from Transformers: Dark of 
the Moon wrapped up filming on August 16, 2010.[38] The History Channel 
documentary Life After People was filmed in run-down and derelict parts 
of Gary, Indiana.[39] Meredith Willson's 1957 Broadway musical The Music 
Man featured the song "Gary, Indiana", in which lead character (and con 
man) Professor Harold Hill wistfully recalls his alleged hometown. In the 
play, Hill claims to be an alumnus of "Gary Conservatory of Music, Class 
of '05," but his entire reference to Gary is later revealed to be another 
of his lies, as the City of Gary was not founded until 1906. Willson's 
musical, set in 1912, later was the basis of a film (1962) and a television 
film (2003). The following sports franchises are based in Gary: St. Augustine's

the hometown of The Jackson 5, a family of musicians who influenced the 
sound of modern popular music. In 1950, Joseph and Katherine Jackson moved 
from East Chicago, Indiana[45] into their two bedroom house at 2300 Jackson 
St. in Gary, Indiana, after they were married on November 5, 1949. The 
famous siblings would later record a song entitled "2300 Jackson Street"
