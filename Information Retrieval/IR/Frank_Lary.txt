Frank Strong Lary (born April 10, 1930) is a former Major League Baseball 
pitcher for the Detroit Tigers (1954–1964), New York Mets (1964, 1965), 
Milwaukee Braves (1964), and Chicago White Sox (1965). He led the American 
League with 21 wins in 1956 and ranked second in the same category with 
23 wins in 1961. Lary was selected to the American League All-Star team 
in 1960 and 1961 and won the Gold Glove Award in 1961. He was known variously 
as "Taters", "Mule", and the "Yankee Killer." The latter nickname was won 
due to his 27-10 record against the New York Yankees from 1955 to 1961. 
Lary was born in Northport, Alabama, in April 1930. He was raised with 
six brothers on his family's farm near Northport.[1] His father, J. Milton 
"Mitt" Lary, was a semipro spitball pitcher,[2] and five of the Lary brothers 
went on to play baseball for the University of Alabama.[3][4] His older 
brother Al Lary was briefly a pitcher for the Chicago Cubs, but spent most 
of his baseball career in the minor leagues. Lary followed his older brothers 
to the University of Alabama,[5] where he had a 10-1 record in 1950 and 
won two more games in the College World Series.[3] Lary dropped out of 
Alabama after two years to play professional baseball.[3] After his performance 
in the 1950 College World Series, Lary signed a $6,000 contract with the 
Toledo Mudhens, the Detroit Tigers' American Association farm club.[3] 
He began his minor league career playing at Thomasville, Georgia, in the 
Georgia–Florida League. After winning four consecutive games in Thomasville, 
he moved to Jamestown, New York, in the PONY League, where he compiled 
a 5-2 record.[3] Lary missed the 1951 and 1952 seasons due to service in 
the U.S. Army.[3] He was considered a leading prospect with the Buffalo 
Bisons of the International League in 1953 and 1954.[6] During the 1953 
season, he compiled a 17-11 record and threw a no-hitter against Ottawa. 
In 1954, he compiled a 15-11 record and won 10 of his last 12 games.[3][7] 
Lary was called up to the Tigers late in the 1954 season, making his Major 
League debut on September 14.[8] He played in parts of 11 seasons for the 
Tigers, and his 123 wins rank tenth in team history.[9] In 1955, Lary stepped 
into the Tigers' rotation as a starter and compiled a record of 14-15 in 
36 games.[8][10] In 1956, Lary compiled a 21-13 record and became the Tigers' 
first 20-game winner since Hal Newhouser won 21 games in 1948. His record 
was 17-3 after July 1.[11] Lary also led the American League in multiple 
statistical categories in 1956, including wins (21), games started (38), 
innings pitched (294), hits allowed (289), hit batsmen (12), and batters 
faced (1,269), and finished 17th in the voting for Most Valuable Player 
in the American League.[8] His total of 1,269 batters faced was the highest 
total by a pitcher in the American League during the 1950s.[12] During 
his years with the Tigers, Lary became known as "The Yankee Killer." He 
had a 27-10 record against the New York Yankees from 1955 to 1961, years 
during which the Yankees won six American League pennants. In 1956, he 
compiled a record of 5-1 against a Yankees team that had an overall record 
of 97-57. In 1958, he was 7-1 against a Yankees team that had an overall 
record of 92-62. He became the first pitcher to win seven games in one 
year against the Yankees since Ed Cicotte accomplished the feat in 1916. 
A good hitting pitcher, Lary defeated the Yankees 4-3 on May 12, 1961, 
by hitting a lead off home run in the top of the ninth inning. This took 
place immediately following the ejection of teammate, outfielder Rocky 
Colavito, who had bolted into the stands at Yankee Stadium when he observed 
a Yankee fan tussling with his father.[1][13][14] In The Sporting News, 
Joe Falls wrote: "As far as Frank Lary is concerned, the war between the 
states never did end. There merely was an 89-year interlude between Lee's 
surrender at Appomattox in 1865 and Lary's arrival in the major leagues 
in 1954. The objective has remained the same: rout the Yankees."[1] He 
was also 5-1 against the Yankees in 1959. Yankees manager Casey Stengel 
once delayed the appearance of his star pitcher, Whitey Ford, by one day 
so Ford would not have to face Lary. Stengel explained to reporters, "If 
Lary is going to beat us anyway, why should I waste my best pitcher?" Lary 
also was known by the nickname "Taters" after a teammate noticed him write 
"Taters" for potatoes on a dining car order during a 1955 road trip. "He 
has been 'Taters' around the clubhouse and in the dugout ever since."[3] 
In a 1961 profile of Lary, Sports Illustrated wrote: "Frank Lary is a classic 
kind of ballplayer—the type, alas, you don't see much of these days. He 
is a throwback to the Cardinals of the 30's, a cotton pickin', gee-tar 
strummin', red clay Alabama farm boy, unspoiled by a little college or 
a lot of success. He is mean on the mound and a joker off it. To strangers 
he is quiet, but to the Tigers he is the Jonathan Winters of the dugout, 
keeping them loose and laughing. Sometimes he is a Casey Stengel, his legs 
bowed, his pants rolled above his knees. Then he is the trainer, complete 
in white shirt, white trousers and with a Turkish towel wrapped around 
his head."[2] In 1960, Lary was selected for the first time as an All-Star. 
He led the American League that year in games started (36), complete games 
(15), innings pitched (279.1) and hit batsmen (19).[8] In 1961, Lary had 
the best season of his career. With a record of 23-9, he was the top pitcher 
on a 1961 Detroit Tigers team that compiled a record of 101-61. Lary's 
23 wins were a career-high and second in the American League to Ford. Lary 
also threw a career-high and league-leading 22 complete games in 1961.[8] 
Lary was also selected for the American League All-Star team and won the 
Gold Glove Award in 1961.[8] He finished third in the 1961 Cy Young Award 
behind Ford and Warren Spahn.[15] Lary was a workhorse for the Tigers from 
1955 to 1961. During that seven-year span, Lary led the American League 
in wins (117), complete games (115), innings pitched (1,799-2/3), games 
started (242), and batters faced (7,569).[16] He started more than 30 games 
in each of those seven season and led the American League in complete games 
three times in four years from 1958 to 1961.[8] In 1962, the workload caught 
up with Lary, as he began having shoulder problems. He began the season 
with a 2-6 record and had only two complete games in 13 starts. He was 
placed on the disabled list in August 1962.[17] Lary started the 1963 season 
in the minor leagues,[18] and compiled a record of 4-9 after being recalled 
to the Tigers.[8] He began the 1963 season with an 0-2 record for Detroit, 
giving him a record of 6-17 in his final three seasons in Detroit.[8] In 
May 1964, the New York Mets purchased Lary from the Tigers.[19] Lary compiled 
a 2-3 record for the Mets, and threw a two-hit shutout in his last game 
for the team during the 1964 season. In August 1964, the Mets traded Lary 
to the Milwaukee Braves in exchange for Dennis Ribant and $25,000.[20] 
He was reacquired by the Mets in March 1965.[21] Lary had a 1-3 record 
for the Mets in 1965.[8] In July 1965, the Mets traded Lary to the Chicago 
White Sox for a player to be named later.[22] Lary appeared in 14 games 
for the White Sox and compiled a 1-0 record.[8] After finishing his pitching 
career, Lary went on to coach and scout for various teams. After retiring 
from baseball, Lary lived in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where he began a construction 
business.[5] In 1986, he was living in Northport and working for a company
