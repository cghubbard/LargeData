On-base plus slugging (OPS) is a sabermetric baseball statistic calculated 
as the sum of a player's on-base percentage and slugging average.[1] The 
ability of a player both to get on base and to hit for power, two important 
offensive skills, are represented. An OPS of .900 or higher in Major League 
Baseball puts the player in the upper echelon of hitters. Typically, the 
league leader in OPS will score near, and sometimes above, the 1.000 mark. 
The basic equation is O P S = O B P + S L G {\displaystyle OPS=OBP+SLG\,} 
where OBP is on-base percentage and SLG is slugging average. These averages 
are defined S L G = T B A B {\displaystyle SLG={\frac {TB}{AB}}} and O 
B P = H + B B + H B P A B + B B + S F + H B P {\displaystyle OBP={\frac 
{H+BB+HBP}{AB+BB+SF+HBP}}} where: In one equation, OPS can be represented 
as: O P S = A B ∗ ( H + B B + H B P ) + T B ∗ ( A B + B B + S F + H B P 
) A B ∗ ( A B + B B + S F + H B P ) {\displaystyle OPS={\frac {AB*(H+BB+HBP)+TB*(AB+BB+SF+HBP)}{AB*(AB+BB+SF+HBP)}}} 
OPS does not present a complete picture of a player's offensive contributions. 
Factors such as baserunning, basestealing, and the leverage/timeliness 
of performance are not considered. More expansive sabermetric measurements 
do attempt to incorporate some or all of the abovementioned factors. Nonetheless, 
even though it does not include them, OPS correlates quite well with team 
run scoring. Other sabermetric stats, such as runs created and Wins Above 
Replacement, attempt to express a player's contribution directly in terms 
of runs and/or wins. However, a player's OPS does not have a simple intrinsic 
meaning. OPS is a convenient calculation, but presents several issues. 
OPS weighs on-base percentage and slugging average equally. However, on-base 
percentage correlates better with scoring runs.[2] Statistics such as wOBA 
build on this distinction using linear weights. Additionally, the components 
of OPS are not typically equal (league-average slugging percentages are 
usually 75-100 points higher than league-average on-base percentages). 
As a point of reference, the OPS for all of Major League Baseball in 2008 
was .749.[3] Bill James, in his essay titled "The 96 Families of Hitters"[4] 
uses seven different categories for classification by OPS: This effectively 
transforms OPS into a 7-point ordinal scale. Substituting quality labels 
such as Excellent (A), Very Good (B), Good (C), Average (D), Fair (E), 
Poor (F) and Very Poor (G) for the A-G categories creates a subjective 
reference for OPS values. On-base plus slugging was first popularized in 
1984 by John Thorn and Pete Palmer's book, The Hidden Game of Baseball.[5] 
The New York Times then began carrying the leaders in this statistic in 
its weekly "By the Numbers" box, a feature that continued for four years. 
Baseball journalist Peter Gammons used and evangelized the statistic, and 
other writers and broadcasters picked it up. The popularity of OPS gradually 
spread, and by 2004 it began appearing on Topps baseball cards.[6] OPS 
was formerly sometimes known as "Production." For instance, in early versions 
of Thorn's Total Baseball encyclopedia, and in the Strat-O-Matic computer 
baseball game. This term has fallen out of use. The top ten Major League 
Baseball players in lifetime OPS, with at least 3,000 plate appearances 
through the end of the 2015 season, are (active players in bold): The top

hitter was 1.2449 by Rogers Hornsby in 1925, 13th on the all-time list.

- Single-Season Records for OPS OPS+, Adjusted OPS, is a closely related 
statistic. OPS+ is OPS adjusted for the park and the league in which the 
player played, but not for fielding position. An OPS+ of 100 is defined 
to be the league average. An OPS+ of 150 or more is excellent and 125 very 
good, while an OPS+ of 75 or below is poor. The basic equation for OPS+ 
is O P S + = 100 ∗ ( O B P ∗ l g O B P + S L G ∗ l g S L G − 1 ) {\displaystyle 
OPS+=100*({\frac {OBP}{*lgOBP}}+{\frac {SLG}{*lgSLG}}-1)} where *lgOBP 
is the park adjusted OBP of the league (not counting pitchers hitting) 
and *lgSLG is the park adjusted SLG of the league. A common misconception 
is that OPS+ closely matches the ratio of a player's OPS to that of the 
league. In fact, due to the additive nature of the two components in OPS+, 
a player with an OBP and SLG both 50% better than league average in those 
metrics will have an OPS+ of 200 (twice the league average OPS+) while 
still having an OPS that is only 50% better than the average OPS of the 
league. It would be a better (although not exact) approximation to say 
that a player with an OPS+ of 150 produces 50% more runs, in a given set 
of plate appearances, as a player with an OPS+ of 100. Through the end 
of the 2015 season, the career leaders in OPS+ (minimum 3,000 plate appearances) 
were   1. Babe Ruth, 206   2. Ted Williams, 190   3. Barry Bonds, 181

which some baseball experts consider not to be a true major league ** - 
Ross Barnes may have been aided by a rule that made a bunt fair if it first 
rolled in fair territory. He did not play nearly so well when this rule 
was removed, although injuries may have been mostly to blame, as his fielding 
statistics similarly declined. If Dunlap's and Barnes' seasons were to 
be eliminated from the list, two other Ruth seasons (1926 and 1927) would 
be on the list. This would also eliminate the only right-handed batter
