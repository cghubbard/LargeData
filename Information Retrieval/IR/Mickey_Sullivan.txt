Mickey Sullivan (February 6, 1932 – March 22, 2012) was the head baseball 
coach at Baylor from 1974 to 1994.[1] Sullivan was born in Aransas Pass, 
Texas on February 6, 1932 to Alva Sullivan and Effie Sullivan, née McCollum.[2][3] 
Sullivan grew up in Houston, Texas and graduated from Sam Houston High 
School in 1950.[2] As a senior running back at Sam Houston, Sullivan led 
the city in rushing and scoring, making the 1949 Houston Chronicle All-City 
Team.[3] Sullivan was recruited to play college football by the University 
of Texas, Texas A&M University, the University of Houston, Rice University, 
the University of Kansas, and LSU, ultimately accepting a college football 
scholarship to attend Baylor University.[3] As a freshman in 1950, Sullivan 
played on the freshman football team for head coach Sam Boyd.[3] As a sophomore, 
Sullivan was a running back on the 1951 Baylor Bears football team.[3] 
Led by All-American quarterback Larry Isbell, the Bears went on to play 
in the Orange Bowl and finished the season ranked #9 by the Associated 
Press and UPI, Baylor's highest finish in either poll.[4] Ultimately, while 
never becoming a full-time starter, Sullivan went on to be a three-year 
letter winner under head coach George Sauer.[3][4] As a baseball player, 
Sullivan earned All-Southwest Conference honors in 1952, 1953, and 1954 
and earned All-American honors as an outfielder in both 1953 and 1954.[2] 
As a senior, Sullivan hit .519, a Southwest Conference record.[2] After 
his sophomore year at Baylor, Sullivan was approached by the Washington 
Senators and offered a minor league baseball contract but Sullivan elected 
to return to Baylor.[3] Upon his graduation from Baylor, Sullivan signed 
with the Dallas Eagles of the Texas League.[3] Sullivan spent the 1954 
season playing minor league baseball for the Artesia Numexers of the Longhorn 
League, a Class C affiliate of the Eagles.[3][5] Sullivan began the 1955 
season with the Class A Sioux City Soos of the Western League until being 
called up to the Eagles for the last 52 games.[6] Sullivan also spent the 
1956 and 1957 season with the Eagles before retiring.[6] Upon his retirement 
from professional baseball, Sullivan began his coaching career as a football 
coach at Jane Long Middle School in Houston.[3] Sullivan became an assistant 
football, baseball, and basketball coach at Bellaire High School before 
moving to Westbury High School where Sullivan was an assistant football 
coach and the head baseball coach.[3] Sullivan ultimately returned to Bellaire 
High School as the head football coach.[3] Sullivan also served a scout 
for the Philadelphia Phillies where, among other players, he scouted Nolan 
Ryan.[3] Sullivan returned to Baylor in 1969 as the freshman football coach.[4] 
In 1972, Grant Teaff promoted Sullivan to recruiting coordinator, a position 
he held until 1978.[4] In 1974, Sullivan became Baylor Bears baseball's 
17th head coach, a position he would hold for the next 21 seasons.[1] Sullivan 
endured just three losing seasons over those 21 years, leading Baylor to 
three Southwest Conference tournament championships and back-to-back trips 
to the College World Series in 1977 and 1978.[1] In addition to 1977 and 
1978, Sullivan also led Baylor to the NCAA Tournament in 1991 and 1993.[1] 
Sullivan coached thirty-one players who were selected in the Major League 
Baseball Draft, including four who were selected in the first round: Jon 
Perlman (1979), Stan Hilton (1983), Pat Combs (1988), and Scott Ruffcorn 
(1991).[1] Sullivan coached ten players who went on to play Major League 
Baseball: Steve Macko, Perlman, Andy Beene, Fritzie Connally, Lee Tunnell, 
Ken Patterson, Blaine Beatty, Combs, Ruffcorn, and Dean Crow.[1] On April 
17, 2012, Steve Smith broke Sullivan's Baylor all-sports' record of 649 
career victories.[7] In 1959, Sullivan married his wife Marilyn.[3] Together, 
they had a son, Vince, and a daughter, Tina.[3] On March 22, 2012, Sullivan 
died at the age of 80 after a long battle with cancer.[8] His memorial 
service was held at Baylor Ballpark on March 26.[8]       National champion
