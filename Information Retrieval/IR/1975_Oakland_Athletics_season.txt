The Oakland Athletics' 1975 season involved the A's finishing first in 
the American League West with a record of 98 wins and 64 losses. They went 
on to play the Boston Red Sox in the 1975 American League Championship 
Series, losing in three straight games. On December 13, 1974, arbitrator 
Peter Seitz ruled in Hunter's favor. As a result, Hunter became a free 
agent, and signed a contract with the New York Yankees for the 1975 season.[2] 
Despite the loss of Hunter, the A's repeated as A.L. West champions in 
1975, but lost the ALCS to Boston in a 3-game sweep. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
