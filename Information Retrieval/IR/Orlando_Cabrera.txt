Orlando Luis Cabrera, nicknamed "O-Cab" and "The OC", (born November 2, 
1974) is a Colombian-American former baseball infielder. He won a World 
Series championship in 2004 with the Boston Red Sox. He has played for 
the Montreal Expos, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Chicago White Sox, Oakland 
Athletics, Minnesota Twins, Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Indians and San 
Francisco Giants. Cabrera is the younger brother of former major leaguer 
Jolbert Cabrera. Cabrera won the Gold Glove Award in 2001 and in 2007. 
He announced his retirement before the 2012 season. On July 18, 1999, Cabrera 
popped up to end David Cone's perfect game. In 2002, he led all major league 
ballplayers in errors, totaling 29.[1] In 2003, he finished second among 
the league shortstops in batting average (.297), slugging percentage (.415), 
runs batted in (80), and stolen base percentage (24-to-26). In addition, 
he was one of four Montreal Expos players to have played all 162 games 
in a season, and the first to do it twice. Also, his 17 home runs that 
season were the most ever by a shortstop in Expos history. Since the Expos 
traded Cabrera to the Red Sox in 2004, he appeared in six of the seven 
MLB postseasons, and at least once with every team he spent the end of 
the season with (2004 with Boston, 2005 and 2007 with Los Angeles, 2008 
with Chicago, 2009 with Minnesota, and 2010 with Cincinnati). Cabrera was 
traded by Montreal to the Boston Red Sox in the summer of 2004, on the 
last day of the July trading deadline. Cabrera batted .294 with six home 
runs and 31 RBIs in 58 games with the Red Sox. He also brought stability 
to the shortstop position. The trade, which also netted first baseman Doug 
Mientkiewicz from the Twins, shored up Boston's infield defense and energized 
the team, which went 42–19 after the deal to win the American League's 
wild card (56–45 before the trade). "He is a game-changer in the field 
for me", Curt Schilling said. He hit a home run on his first at-bat with 
the Red Sox on August 1, becoming the eighth Boston player to accomplish 
the feat. In Game 2 of the 2004 ALDS, he hit a bases-clearing double, as 
the Red Sox went on to sweep the 3 game series from the Los Angeles Angels. 
Boston went on to win its first World Series title since 1918 with a four-game 
sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals. Following his 2004 World Series victory 
with the Red Sox, Cabrera signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Angels. 
He replaced fan favorite David Eckstein at shortstop. In 2007, Cabrera 
led qualified AL shortstops with a .983 fielding percentage and a league-low 
11 errors, earning him the American League Gold Glove for shortstop, the 
first by an Angel shortstop since Jim Fregosi in 1967. Also, he stole 20 
bases for the third straight year and the fifth time overall. Cabrera had 
a 63-game on-base streak in early-through-mid-2006, which was among the 
top five streaks of all time. Ted Williams holds the Major League record 
with 84 straight games reaching base by a hit, walk, or hit-by-pitch. Cabrera 
also had a straight steal of home plate on July 2, 2006, the first such 
time it had happened by an Angels player since 1997. Cabrera scored without 
a throw. On November 19, 2007, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox along 
with cash considerations for Jon Garland. Cabrera's one season with White 
Sox was marred with controversy: arguing with manager Ozzie Guillén, leaving 
the clubhouse early to avoid the media,[2] calling the press box to have 
errors overturned,[3] questioning his team's attitude, and kicking dirt 
at Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Grant Balfour during an at-bat in Game 1 of the 
AL Divisional Series.[4] On March 6, 2009, Cabrera signed a one-year deal 
and played middle infield with the Oakland Athletics.[5][6] On July 31, 
2009, Cabrera was traded to the Minnesota Twins with cash considerations 
for SS Tyler Ladendorf. In 2009, Cabrera led all major league players in 
errors, with 25.[7] He had a solid offensive year, finishing the season 
batting .284, with 186 hits (4th among all shortstops), and 77 RBIs (1st 
among AL shortstops and 4th out of all shortstops).[8] His seventh-inning, 
two-run home run in the American League Central Division's tiebreaker game 
on October 6, 2009, kept the Twins in the game, which they later won, 6–5, 
in the 12th inning, to advance to post-season play.[9] On February 1, 2010, 
Cabrera signed a 1-year contract with the Cincinnati Reds.[10] Cabrera 
spent the season as the Reds shortstop and posted a .263 average with four 
home runs, 42 RBIs, and a .303 on-base percentage. Cabrera played in only 
123 games due to a strained oblique muscle that kept him on the DL from 
August 3 to September 3.[11] The injury continued to bother him in September 
and into the playoffs, culminating with Dusty Baker giving him the start 
in game three of the NLDS despite Cabrera mentioning pain. In the first 
inning Cabrera made a high throw to first that allowed a run to score. 
While on the disabled list, Cabrera spent one game in full batboy uniform, 
bringing balls to the umpire and collecting bats. The Reds declined the 
option for 2011 on his contract with a $1 million buyout. Reds GM Walt 
Jocketty expressed that he wanted to bring back Cabrera at a price lower 
than the $4 million option.[11] On February 10, 2011, Cabrera signed a 
one-year contract for $1 million with the Cleveland Indians.[12] With Asdrúbal 
Cabrera in place at shortstop, Cabrera switched to playing second base. 
On June 12, 2011, Cabrera got his 2,000th hit in Yankee Stadium off of 
pitcher Freddy García. On July 21, Jason Kipnis was called up to share 
duties with Cabrera, who had hit .172 in the month of July and .244/.275/.323 
for the season.[13][14][15] On July 30, 2011, Cabrera was traded to the 
San Francisco Giants for minor league outfielder Thomas Neal. He was originally 
given the number 6, but opted to wear number 43, out of respect for J. 
T. Snow. On January 18, 2012, Cabrera announced his retirement on a radio 
show in his native home country of Colombia.[16] In November of the same 
year, his brother Jolbert said Orlando could come out of retirement and 
play for the Colombia national baseball team if they advance to the final 
round of the 2013 World Baseball Classic.[17] Cabrera became a naturalized 
U.S. citizen on May 19, 2011, in South Carolina. He lives in Windham, New
