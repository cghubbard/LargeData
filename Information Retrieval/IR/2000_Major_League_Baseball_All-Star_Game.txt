The 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 71st playing of the 
midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and 
National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. 
The game was held on July 11, 2000 at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia, 
home of the Atlanta Braves of the National League. The Florida Marlins 
were originally awarded the 2000 All-Star game in July 1995, but then-NL 
president Len Coleman took it away in November 1998 and gave it to the 
Atlanta Braves, saying the league wanted the game in new ballparks. The 
result of the game was the American League defeating the National League 
by a score of 6â€“3. The 2000 All-Star Game was one of the few occurrences 
in which the manager of the host team also managed the home team of the 
game, in this case, the National League (Bobby Cox had led the Braves to 
the World Series the previous year earning the right to manage the National 
League). It is remembered for Chipper Jones' home run off of James Baldwin. 
This was also the last MLB All-Star Game that was broadcast on NBC. Players 
in italics have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of
