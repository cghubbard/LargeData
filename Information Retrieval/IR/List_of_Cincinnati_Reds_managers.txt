The Cincinnati Reds are an American professional baseball franchise based 
in Cincinnati, Ohio. They are members of the National League Central Division 
in Major League Baseball. In chronological order, the Reds have played 
their home games in the Bank Street Grounds, League Park, the Palace of 
the Fans, Redland Field (later known as Crosley Field), and Riverfront 
Stadium (later known as Cinergy Field).[1] Since 2003, the Reds have played 
their home games at Great American Ball Park.[2] There have been fifty-nine 
different managers in the team's franchise history: four while it was known 
as the Cincinnati Red Stockings (1882–1889), four while it was known as 
the Cincinnati Redlegs (1953–1958) and the other fifty-one under the Cincinnati 
Reds (1882–1952, 1959–present). In baseball, the head coach of a team is 
called the manager, or more formally, the field manager. Pop Snyder was 
the first manager of the Reds and managed from 1882 to 1884. Sparky Anderson 
is the franchise's all-time leader in regular-season games managed (1,450) 
and regular-season game wins (863). He is followed by Bill McKechnie in 
both categories with 1,386 and 744, respectively. Anderson is the only 
Reds manager to have won the World Series twice, in 1975 and 1976. Pat 
Moran, Lou Piniella, and McKechnie have one World Series victory each; 
Moran was the manager during the Black Sox Scandal, which refers to the 
events that took place in the 1919 World Series.[3][4] McKechnie led the 
team to the championship in 1940, while Piniella led the team to it in 
1990.[4] Jack McKeon is the only manager to have won the Manager of the 
Year Award with the Reds, which he won in 1999.[5] The most recent manager 
of the Reds is Bryan Price, and the current owner is Robert Castellini. 
The manager with the highest winning percentage over a full season or more 
was Pop Snyder, with a winning percentage of .648.[6] Conversely, the worst 
winning percentage over a full season or more in franchise history is .382 
by Donie Bush, who posted a 58–94 record during the 1933 season.[7] Note:
