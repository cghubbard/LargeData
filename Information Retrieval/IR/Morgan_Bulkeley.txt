Morgan Gardner Bulkeley (December 26, 1837 – November 6, 1922) was an American 
politician as well as business and sports executive. Bulkeley, a Republican, 
served in the American Civil War, was a Hartford city councilman and bank 
president, was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame as the first 
president of the National League, and became a four-term mayor of Hartford, 
the 54th Governor of Connecticut for two terms and a United States Senator 
while serving as the third president of the Aetna Life Insurance Company 
for 43 years. Bulkeley was born in East Haddam, Connecticut to an old local 
family. His father, State Senator Eliphalet Adams Bulkeley, was a descendant 
of the Reverend Peter Bulkeley, 8 generations removed. Peter Bulkeley was 
the founder of Concord Massachusetts and sailed to this country from England 
on the ship Susan & Ellen in May 1635. Morgan Bulkeley's mother Lydia-Smith 
Morgan descended from passengers of the Mayflower more than 200 years prior.[1] 
The Bulkeleys had called nearby Colchester, Connecticut their home and 
until Morgan's death always believed it as such.[citation needed] He was 
also related to the well known Morgan family through his mother.[citation 
needed] He was educated at Bacon Academy in Colchester just like his father 
and his cousins on both sides.[citation needed] In 1846, the Bulkeley family 
moved to Hartford, Connecticut.[2] Morgan's father, Eliphalet Adams Bulkeley, 
was prominent in the Connecticut Republican Party and helped found the 
Aetna Life Insurance Company, becoming its first president in 1853.[3][4] 
He was also a descendant of the third President of Harvard University, 
Charles Chauncy.[2] Morgan Bulkeley attended Hartford Public High School 
and, at age 14, started working at the Aetna sweeping floors for a dollar 
a day[1][3] along with his brother, Charles.[5] Bulkeley left Hartford 
to work for his uncle's company, H. P. Morgan & Company, in Brooklyn, New 
York. He was an errand boy in Brooklyn in 1852 and later worked as a salesman.[2][3] 
During the Civil War, Bulkeley served as a private with the 13th New York 
Volunteer Heavy Artillery. [6] He served from May 28, 1862 until September 
28, 1862. He served under General George B. McClellan in the Peninsula 
Campaign and later under General Joseph K. Mansfield.[2] His brother, Captain 
Charles E. Bulkeley, was killed during the war.[5] He became a companion 
of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States by right 
of inheritance from his brother, who would have been eligible for membership 
had he lived. [7] After the Civil War, Bulkeley returned to Morgan & Company. 
When his father died in 1872, Bulkeley returned to Hartford and helped 
form the United States Bank of Hartford, becoming its first president.[2] 
He later served on Aetna's board of directors.[1] After returning to Hartford 
in the early days of professional baseball, Bulkeley formed the Hartford 
Dark Blues of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players 
in 1874. In 1875, the team featured Hall of Fame pitcher Candy Cummings 
and player-manager Bob "Death to Flying Things" Ferguson. In 1876, the 
NAPBBP was replaced by the National League. Hartford was one of the charter 
members and Bulkeley was named the league's first president. In his only 
season as president, he targeted illegal gambling, drinking and fan rowdiness.[8] 
After the season, he was replaced as president by William Hulbert. Bulkeley 
was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 1937, 15 
years after his death. He was also one of the seven members of the Mills 
Commission formed by Albert Spalding, the group that gave credence to the 
myth that Abner Doubleday invented baseball.[9] Bulkeley's short career 
as a baseball executive coincided with the beginning of his political career. 
From 1874 to 1876, he served on the Hartford Common Council[10] and the 
Board of Aldermen.[3][11] When Thomas O. Enders resigned Aetna's presidency 
due to ill health in 1879, Bulkeley became the company's third president.[4] 
In 1880, Bulkeley ran for both mayor of Hartford and governor of Connecticut. 
He lost the gubernatorial race but won the mayoral race and was Hartford's 
mayor from 1880 to 1888.[3] As mayor he became known for his flamboyant 
generosity; for instance, arranging steamboat trips on the Connecticut 
River for underprivileged children, using his own money.[12] While mayor 
of Hartford, on February 11, 1885, Bulkeley married Fannie Briggs Houghton 
in San Francisco, California. They had two sons and a daughter.[3] In 1888, 
Bulkeley again ran for governor. In the election, Luzon B. Morris accumulated 
more votes than Bulkeley but neither had the required 50%. In accordance 
with the rules of the time, the General Assembly decided the winner and 
the largely Republican body chose Bulkeley.[3] Although he did not run 
in 1890, the vote was so close[2] and fell into such disarray due to ballot 
irregularities in Bridgeport that officials did not certify the results, 
and the Connecticut House of Representatives and Senate, each led by opposing 
parties, could not agree on a legal successor. When Bulkeley refused to 
recognize the Democratic candidate as the victor, the Democratic state 
comptroller changed the lock on an anteroom that led from the governor's 
office to the Statehouse. When Bulkeley found the door locked the next 
morning, he broke in with a crowbar, earning the nickname the "Crow-Bar 
Governor". Bulkeley remained in office two more years, and the state Supreme 
Court unanimously held that he had been the lawful governor for the disputed 
period of time.[12] Bulkeley later served one term in the U.S. Senate from 
1905 to 1911, as part of the "Millionaires' Senate" of 1906, so named for 
the wealth of its members.[4] Morgan Bulkeley died in Hartford at age 84. 
At the time of his death, Bulkeley had been the president of Aetna for 
43 years and had increased its assets from $25.7 million to $207 million 
and from 29 to 1,500 employees. Under his guidance, Aetna had been transformed 
from a life insurance company into a company that offered accident, health, 
automobile,workers compensation, and group insurance. He was succeeded 
by his nephew, Morgan B. Brainard, who led Aetna for the following 35 years.[4][12] 
Bulkeley's widow, Fannie, died on June 22, 1938.[3] He was a member of 
the Freemasons, Society of the Cincinnati, Grand Army of the Republic, 
Sons of the Revolution, Sons of the American Revolution, Society of Colonial 
Wars and the Military Order of Foreign Wars. In 1894 he was elected as 
a Hereditary Companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military 
Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States by right of inheritance 
from his brother, Captain Charles E. Bulkeley, was killed during the Civil 
War. The Hartford Bridge over the Connecticut River was renamed the Bulkeley
