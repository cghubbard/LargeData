"Baseball's Sad Lexicon," also known as "Tinker to Evers to Chance" after 
its refrain, is a 1910 baseball poem by Franklin Pierce Adams. The poem 
is presented as a single, rueful stanza from the point of view of a New 
York Giants fan watching the Chicago Cubs infield of shortstop Joe Tinker, 
second baseman Johnny Evers, and first baseman Frank Chance complete a 
double play. Tinker, Evers, and Chance began playing together with the 
Cubs in 1902, and formed a double play combination that lasted through 
April 1912. The Cubs won the National League pennant four times from 1906 
and 1910 (and the 1908 World Series), often defeating the Giants en route 
to the World Series. The poem was first published in the New York Evening 
Mail on July 12, 1910. Popular among sportswriters, numerous additional 
verses were written. The poem gave Tinker, Evers, and Chance increased 
popularity. It has been credited with their elections to the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1946. Frank Chance joined the Chicago Cubs in 1898 as a 
reserve catcher, backing up Tim Donahue and Johnny Kling. Frank Selee, 
the Cubs' manager, decided that Chance would be better suited as a first 
baseman. Chance at first opposed the move and even threatened to quit, 
but ultimately obliged.[1] Joe Tinker was a third baseman in minor league 
baseball, but in 1902 made the Cubs as a shortstop, replacing Barry McCormick.[2] 
Johnny Evers made his major league debut with the Cubs on September 1 at 
shortstop, with Selee moving Tinker from shortstop to third base.[3] Three 
days later, Selee returned Tinker to shortstop and assigned Evers to second 
base to back up Bobby Lowe.[3] Lowe suffered a knee injury late in the 
1902 season, providing Evers with more playing time.[3] Tinker, Evers, 
and Chance first appeared in a game together on September 13, 1902. They 
turned their first double play on September 15, 1902.[4] Lowe's injury 
did not properly heal during the offseason, making Evers the new permanent 
second baseman for the Cubs in 1903.[3] Chance succeeded Selee as manager 
during the 1905 season when Selee became ill.[1] The Cubs, led by Tinker, 
Evers, and Chance, won the National League pennant in 1906, 1907, 1908, 
and 1910. In 1908, the Cubs clinched the pennant after defeating the Giants 
in part due to Merkle's Boner. In the Merkle game, Tinker hit a home run 
off of Christy Mathewson,[2] and Evers alerted umpire Hank O'Day to Merkle's 
baserunning gaffe.[3] In the replay of the Merkle game, Tinker hit a triple 
off of Mathewson that started the rally that gave the Cubs the victory, 
clinching the pennant.[2][5] From 1906 to 1910, the Cubs turned 491 double 
plays, the third-most in the NL during that time. According to Bill James' 
formula, "expected double plays", the Cubs led the NL with 50 more double 
plays than expected during those five seasons.[6] From 1906 through 1910, 
the "Tinker, to Evers, to Chance" double play happened 54 times in 770 
games played, and the trio did not collaborate on a double play during 
any of their 21 World Series games.[7] In 1906, the trio committed 194 
errors, though this was in part due to poor field conditions and scorers.[8] 
Franklin Pierce Adams wrote a weekly column for the New York Evening Mail, 
called "Always in Good Humor". Adams hoped to leave work to attend a Giants 
game, but his editor found that Adams had not produced enough content for 
his column. While traveling to the Polo Grounds to see the Giants play 
the Cubs, Adams wrote the poem that would become Baseball's Sad Lexicon, 
while reflecting on Tinker, Evers, and Chance.[4] He considered the lines 
to be forgettable as he wrote them, and an editor at the paper told him 
that he did not consider the work to be "much good".[10] This work was 
first published as "That Double Play Again" in the New York Evening Mail 
on July 12, 1910 (not on July 10 as numerous sources state).[10][11] The 
Chicago Daily Tribune reprinted it as "Gotham's Woe" on July 15, 1910.[12] 
Three days later, on July 18, the New York Evening Mail republished it 
under the title by which it is best known today, "Baseball's Sad Lexicon."[13][14] 
The poem was such a hit that other sportswriters submitted additional verses.[10] 
For the poem's 100th anniversary, Tim Wiles, director of research at the 
Baseball Hall of Fame, conducted research on the poem. He revealed that 
the poem was part of series of poems published in the New York Evening 
Mail and the Chicago Tribune. During the research process, combing the 
archives in the New York Public Library and the Center for Research Libraries, 
they uncovered 29 poems, 15 of which detail a specific play or game that 
had occurred during the 1910 season, with "Baseball's Sad Lexicon" the 
first poem published.[10] In 1911, the Giants overcame the Cubs, capturing 
the first of three consecutive league championships.[15] The trio played 
their final game together on April 12, 1912.[4] While Chance was hospitalized 
for a brain injury suffered while playing, club owner Charles Webb Murphy 
released him after an argument about Murphy's releasing other players with 
high salaries.[1] Murphy named Evers manager for the 1913 season, which 
displeased Tinker, who was traded to the Cincinnati Reds.[2] Murphy fired 
Evers as manager after one season, trading him against his will to the 
Boston Braves in February 1914.[16] As a consequence, National League president 
John K. Tener and newspaper owner Charles P. Taft (who also owned the Philadelphia 
Phillies) made a successful effort to drive Murphy out of baseball.[17] 
Taft purchased the Cubs from Murphy in 1914.[18] Sporting Life commemorated 
the affair with this variation on the poem:[17] Chance died in 1924. Evers 
died in 1947, and Tinker the next year. When members of the trio died, 
the poem was often used to memorialize them.[20][21][22] All three players 
were inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. Their inductions 
have been credited to the fame generated by Adams' poem.[10] Andy Coakley, 
a teammate with the Cubs as well as a coach for Columbia University, regarded 
Tinker, Evers, and Chance to be the best infield in baseball history.[23] 
Bill James, in his 1994 book, Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?, argued 
that Tinker was less accomplished than George Davis, who at the time was 
not a member of the Hall of Fame.[c] The poem gave the trio "everlasting 
fame".[7] Evers made an appearance on Information Please, a radio show 
on which Adams was a panelist in 1938. Evers thanked Adams for writing 
the poem, which he credited with his being remembered.[10] However, many 
forgot Harry Steinfeldt, the third baseman who started alongside Tinker, 
Evers, and Chance from 1906 through 1910.[7][24] Including Steinfeldt, 
the Cubs infield set a record for longevity surpassed by the Los Angeles 
Dodgers infield of first baseman Steve Garvey, second baseman Davey Lopes, 
shortstop Bill Russell, and third baseman Ron Cey, who played together 
for eight years, from 1973 through 1981.[25] Despite their celebrated success 
at turning spectacular plays in collaboration, relations between the teammates 
were said to have been often strained. Tinker and Evers feuded for many 
years.[2] On September 14, 1905, Tinker and Evers engaged in a fistfight 
on the field because Evers had taken a cab to the stadium and left his 
teammates behind in the hotel lobby. They did not speak for years following 
this event.[26] According to some tellings, Tinker and Evers did not speak 
to one another again following their fight for 33 years, until they were 
asked to participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series, between 
the Cubs and the New York Yankees. Neither Tinker nor Evers knew the other 
had been invited.[27][28] However, in 1929, Tinker joined Evers in signing 
a ten-week contract to perform a theatrical skit on baseball in different 
cities across the United States.[26] Ogden Nash's poem "Line-Up For Yesterday," 
written in 1949, references the poem: The phrase "Tinker to Evers to Chance," 
and variations of the phrase using other names, are colloquially used to 
characterize high-caliber teamwork. Examples include: The expression has 
also been used to characterize any process that happens with smoothness 
and precision, as a near-synonym to expressions such as "like clockwork" 
or "a well-oiled machine." For example, in Raymond Chandler's The Long 
Goodbye (1953), detective Philip Marlowe goes through his mail, opens it, 
and tosses it into the waste bin, remarking, "Mail slot to desk to wastebasket, 
Tinker to Evers to Chance."[31] Washington Post journalists Carl Bernstein 
and Bob Woodward used the phrase "Tinker to Evers to Chance" in their account 
of the Post investigation of the Watergate scandal in their 1974 book, 
All the President's Men. The reference described the smooth operation of 
President Richard Nixon's White House staff in responding to allegations 
of misconduct.[32] In an episode of the 1970s TV series, The Brady Bunch, 
Alice, the housekeeper, refers to Greg, Peter and Bobby as "Tinker to Evers 
to Chance" as the boys enter the kitchen after a baseball game. Musician 
Scott Miller, leader of the 1980s band Game Theory, chose Tinker to Evers 
to Chance as the ironic title of a 1990 compilation album of the band's 
greatest would-be hits which, despite significant critical acclaim, had 
struck out commercially.[33][34] The poem was set to music and recorded 
in 2010 by Chicago singer/songwriter guitarist Chris McCaughan.[35] The 
song, also titled "Baseball's Sad Lexicon," appears on the album We Chase
