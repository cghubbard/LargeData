Tomoyuki Sugano (菅野 智之, Sugano Tomoyuki?, born October 11, 1989 in Kanagawa 
Prefecture) is a Japanese professional baseball pitcher for the Yomiuri 
Giants in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball.[1] In 2010, he recorded 
the fastest pitch by a Japanese college pitcher at 157 km/h (98 mph).[2] 
Due to his performance as pitcher for Tokai University (37-4, 0.57 ERA), 
Sugano was a top pitching prospect for the October 2011 draft. Prior to 
the draft selection, he declared his desire to join the Yomiuri Giants 
and play under the guidance of his uncle, the present Giants manager Tatsunori 
Hara. It therefore came as a shock[to whom?] when the Fighters also decided 
to select him as their first pick.[3] The two teams fought it out via lottery, 
but the Fighters drew the lucky straw in the end, to the surprise and disappointment 
of Manager Hara and the Giants for they had assumed no other team would 
dare pick Sugano.[4] Both Sugano's father and grandfather were disappointed 
because they were not notified of the Fighters' intention to draft him, 
the latter even quoted saying it was a violation of human rights.[5] The 
Fighters did admit to having intentionally kept their intention to draft 
Sugano unannounced, and apologized for the surprise and the commotion they 
caused.[6] After long consideration and deliberation with his family, Sugano 
finally announced on November 21 his decision to turn down the Fighters' 
offer and instead take the year off and re-enter the 2012 draft. "I may 
be taking a longer route (to becoming a professional ballplayer), but my 
childhood dream (of playing for the Giants) was stronger," he said, hinting 
at his intention to wait until the Giants win the rights to negotiate with 
him.[7] He also mentioned that he wasn't as upset about not being informed 
by the Fighters ahead of time that they might select him, but rather because 
they promised they wouldn't select him.[8] Only two players in NPB history 
have turned down the Fighters: Shinji Kuroda in 1976 and Ikuo Takayama 
in 1980.[9][10] Having no team to play for, he then stayed with Tokai University 
for another year using the "graduation postponement system" established 
for students who are unable to land post-graduation jobs while they are 
still in college. He was not allowed to play in Tokai's official games, 
but this did not sway him enough to join the Industrial League for it will 
take at least two years before he can be drafted again.[7] His wish to 
join the Giants was finally realized when he was selected as their first 
pick in 2012.[11] His fastball velocity was down since the beginning of 
his professional career. His fastball topped out at 153 km/h (95 mph) in 
his first two NPB seasons (2013 to 2014).[12] The Giants confirmed that
