Nicholas Gunnar Goody (born July 6, 1991) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). Goody 
attended University High School in Orlando, Florida.[1] He played for the 
school's baseball team as a shortstop.[2] He enrolled at State College 
of Florida, Manatee–Sarasota to play college baseball, and the team's head 
coach suggested he become a pitcher.[3] As a freshman, he served as the 
team's closer.[1] That summer, Goody pitched for the Winter Park Diamond 
Dawgs of the Florida Collegiate Summer League, and was named most valuable 
player of the league's championship game.[4] As a sophomore, Goody played 
as a starting pitcher, and had a 6–2 win–loss record, 1.29 earned run average 
(ERA), and struck out 114 batters in 84 innings pitched,[1] including 19 
strikeouts in one game.[2] He was named the Suncoast Conference Pitcher 
of the Year as a sophomore.[3] The New York Yankees selected Goody in the 
22nd round of the 2011 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, but Goody opted 
not to sign. He played collegiate summer baseball in the Northwoods League 
for the Mankato Moondogs to focus on the mentality of closing.[1][5] In 
2012, Goody transferred to Louisiana State University (LSU) in order to 
play for the LSU Tigers baseball team. Nick Rumbelow began the season as 
LSU's closer, but Goody assumed the role during the season, finishing with 
11 saves, third most in the Southeastern Conference.[1][3] The Yankees 
selected Goody with their sixth round pick, the 217th overall selection, 
of the 2012 MLB draft.[6][7] Pitching for the Staten Island Yankees of 
the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League, the Charleston RiverDogs 
of the Class A South Atlantic League, and the Tampa Yankees of the Class 
A-Advanced Florida State League, Goody had a 1.12 ERA and seven saves.[2][3] 
In 2013, the Yankees invited Goody to spring training.[3] He began the 
season with Tampa, but underwent Tommy John surgery to repair the ulnar 
collateral ligament of the elbow in his pitching arm, which he injured 
in his second appearance of the season.[2] He returned to Tampa on May 
6, 2014, and was promoted to the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern 
League in June.[3] The Yankees invited Goody to spring training in 2015, 
but reassigned him to minor league camp in mid-March.[8] Goody began the 
2015 season with Trenton, and was named to the Eastern League All-Star 
Game. He was promoted to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Class 
AAA International League in July, and Brady Lail replaced him in the All-Star 
Game.[9][10] On July 25, the Yankees promoted Goody to the major leagues.[11] 
The Yankees optioned Goody back to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on July 28, without 
having made any major league appearances. The Yankees recalled him on July 
30 due to an injury to Michael Pineda.[12] He made his major league debut
