Robert William Brown (born October 25, 1924) is a former third baseman 
and executive in professional baseball who served as president of the American 
League from 1984 to 1994. He also was a physician who studied for his medical 
degree during his eight-year (1946-52, 1954) career as a player with the 
New York Yankees. Brown, born in Seattle, Washington, attended Galileo 
Academy of Science and Technology in San Francisco, then Stanford University 
and UCLA before receiving his medical degree from Tulane University. During 
his time at Stanford, he and another student were involved in the rescue 
of a Coast Guardsman from a plane crash, for which he received a Silver 
Lifesaving Medal. Sometimes known as "Golden Boy" during his baseball career, 
he played 548 regular-season games for the Yankees, with a lifetime batting 
average of .279 with 22 home runs. In addition, he appeared in four World 
Series (1947, 1949, 1950, 1951) for New York, batting .439 in 17 games. 
He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He missed 1½ seasons due 
to military service during the Korean War. Brown had a bases-loaded triple 
in Game 4 and a two-run triple in the championship-clinching Game 5 of 
the 1949 World Series. He tripled again in the final game of the 1950 World 
Series. A famous apocryphal story that has made the rounds for years in 
baseball circles concerns the time when Brown's road roommate was star 
Yankee catcher Yogi Berra, who had little formal education. The two were 
reading in their hotel room one night—Berra a comic book and Brown his 
copy of Boyd's Pathology. Berra came to the end of his comic, tossed it 
aside, and asked Brown, "So, how is yours turning out?" Brown is the last 
living member of the Yankees team that won the 1947 World Series. There 
are no living players who played on an earlier Yankees World Series-winning 
team. Brown practiced cardiology in the Dallas-Fort Worth area until the 
early 1980s, when he returned to baseball as a vice president of the AL 
Texas Rangers. In 1984, he succeeded Lee MacPhail as AL president and held 
the post for a decade; Gene Budig replaced him. In 1992 and 1993, Brown 
presented the World Series Trophy (on both occasions to the Toronto Blue 
Jays) instead of the Commissioner of Baseball. The presidencies of the 
American League and the National League were abolished in 2000 and their 
functions were absorbed into the office of the Commissioner of Baseball. 
A decorated veteran of two wars, a noted baseball player who served on 
five championship teams, an accomplished physician, and the former President 
of the American League, Brown is considered to have few equals in the history 
of major league baseball.[1] He is a regular at the Yankees' annual Old-Timers' 
Day celebrations.[2] On March 27, 1957, Brown was a contestant on the game 
show To Tell The Truth. Repeats of the episode are occasionally broadcast 
on the Game Show Network and can also be seen on You Tube.[3] Brown's wife 
of 61 years, Sara, died in 2012. They were married in October 1951, shortly
