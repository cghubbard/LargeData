David Wilson Boswell (January 20, 1945 – June 11, 2012) was an American 
right-handed pitcher who spent eight seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), 
all in the American League (AL), with the Minnesota Twins (1964–1970), 
Detroit Tigers, and Baltimore Orioles (both in 1971). He won twenty games 
as a starting pitcher during the 1969 Minnesota Twins season, the only 
time he achieved the feat during his major league career. Boswell graduated 
from Calvert Hall College High School in 1963. He drew the interest of 
several major league teams. One was the hometown Orioles who had ranked 
him and Wally Bunker as the two best pitching prospects in the country. 
Not able to afford giving each of them huge signing bonuses, the ballclub 
only signed Bunker after being disappointed by Boswell's performance during 
his senior year. Boswell eventually signed with the Twins for US $15,000.[1] 
Even though the New York Yankees had offered the same amount of money, 
he decided that his chances to make the majors were better with Minnesota.[2] 
After debuting with the Twins in 1965, Boswell pitched for the Twins in 
the team's World Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 1966, Boswell's 
.706 winning percentage (based on a 12–5 record) led the American League. 
Following a 1969 game against the Detroit Tigers, Boswell got into a fight 
with teammate Bob Allison and Manager Billy Martin outside the Lindell 
AC bar near Tiger Stadium. After knocking out Allison with one punch, Boswell 
was in turn knocked out by Martin, resulting in a cut that required 20 
stitches.[3] Despite the off-field injury, Boswell would win 20 games in 
1969, helping the Twins win the American League West. During the American 
League Championship Series, Boswell lost 1–0 in 11 innings to Baltimore 
Orioles pitcher Dave McNally. He later revealed that he had suffered a 
career-ending arm injury during the game on a slider thrown to strike out 
slugger Frank Robinson in the bottom of the 10th. "It felt like my shoulder 
went right into my jawbone," Boswell would tell the Fort Myers News-Press 
years later. "The arm would actually turn black and run all the way down 
to the elbow." [3] After being released by the Twins following the 1970 
season, Boswell briefly played for the Detroit Tigers and the Baltimore 
Orioles during the 1971 season. Boswell was the losing pitcher in Catfish 
Hunter's perfect game on May 8, 1968.[4] Boswell died of a heart attack
