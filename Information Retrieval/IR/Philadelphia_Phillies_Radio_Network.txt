The Philadelphia Phillies Radio Network is a network of 21 radio stations 
in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey that air Major League Baseball 
games of the Philadelphia Phillies.[1] The lead announcers are Scott Franzke 
with play-by-play and Larry Andersen with color commentary.[2] The flagship 
station is WIP-FM 94.1 in Philadelphia. The broadcasts were discontinued 
on the former AM flagship station WPHT 1210 in 2016.[3] This change was 
unpopular with a large segment of the fanbase as game broadcasts could 
be received via WPHT over a large portion of the Eastern United States. 
WEMG in Philadelphia also airs a separate broadcast in Spanish. Danny Martinez 
is the play by play announcer, while Bill Kulik provides color commentary.[4]
