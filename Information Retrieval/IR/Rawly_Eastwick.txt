Rawlins Jackson "Rawly" Eastwick (born October 24, 1950 in Camden, New 
Jersey) is a former Major League Baseball relief pitcher who played from 
1975 to 1981. Eastwick attended Haddonfield High School. He was drafted 
by the Cincinnati Reds in the third round of the 1969 amateur draft. In 
1973, he made it to the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association 
and made his major league debut in September 1974 with the Reds. He started 
back at Indianapolis in 1975 but pitched well and was called up for good. 
In his rookie season, he tied for the National League lead in saves with 
22. Eastwick is best remembered for his 1975 World Series performance against 
the Boston Red Sox. He won games 2 and 3 and also earned a save in Game 
5 as the Reds won the series in seven. In Game Six, however he gave up 
a three-run-home run to Bernie Carbo that sent the game into extra inning, 
which the Red Sox won in twelve innings. In 1976, Eastwick had his best 
season, going 11-5 in relief with a 2.06 earned run average. He also led 
the league in saves and won the NL Fireman of the Year award.[1] The Reds 
won their second consecutive World Series title. In 1977, Eastwick got 
into a contract dispute with the Reds' front office and was traded in June, 
to the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1978, he joined the New York Yankees after 
signing a five-year, $1.1 million deal.[1] The Yankees then traded him 
in June to the Philadelphia Phillies, where he spent the next two seasons. 
Eastwick posted a 4.90 ERA in 1979 and was released. He then pitched for 
the Kansas City Royals in 1980 and the Chicago Cubs in 1981 before retiring.
