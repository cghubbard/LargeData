Norman Thomas "Turkey" Stearnes (May 8, 1901 â€“ September 4, 1979) was an 
African American outfielder in the Negro leagues. He was elected to the 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 2000. Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Stearnes acquired 
his nickname at an early age from his unusual running style. He began his 
career in professional baseball in 1920 with the Nashville Giants, then 
played for the Detroit Stars, beginning in 1923. In 1931, the Stars failed 
to pay Stearnes his salary because of the Great Depression, so he moved 
from team to team for the remainder of his career, retiring in 1942 as 
a member of the Kansas City Monarchs. Stearnes is considered by some as 
one of the great all-around players in the history of baseball, but because 
of his race and his quiet personality, he never received the recognition 
that many believe he deserved. He batted over .400 three times and led 
the Negro leagues in home runs seven times. He is credited with 176 home 
runs in his Negro league career, the all-time Negro league record, and 
50 more than second-place Mule Suttles. Since Negro league seasons were 
very short, sometimes lasting fewer than 30 games, it is unclear how many 
home runs Stearnes might have hit in a 154-game major league season. The 
175-pound Stearnes was a fast baserunner despite his awkward-looking running 
form, and was one of the best outfielders of his generation. In 2001, writer 
Bill James ranked Stearnes as the 25th greatest baseball player of all-time 
and the best left fielder in the Negro leagues.[2] Stearnes' known career 
statistics include a .344 batting average, 176 home runs, 750 games, and 
a .621 slugging percentage. Despite his accomplishments, Stearnes had to 
work winters in Detroit's auto plants to survive, primarily in a factory 
owned by Walter Briggs, who was the owner of the Detroit Tigers, a team 
he couldn't play for because of his skin color. Stearnes was inducted into 
the Hall of Fame in 2000, 21 years after his death in Detroit. He was survived 
by his wife, Nettie Mae. A plaque in Stearnes' honor is on display outside
