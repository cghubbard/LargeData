center of the town is the Manchester census-designated place, with a population

1672 as a farming community, although at the time it was known just as 
Orford Parish (the name that can be found on the memorial to the Revolutionary 
soldiers from the town). The many rivers and brooks provided power for 
paper, lumber and textile industries, and the town quickly evolved into 
an industrial center. The town of Hartford once included the land now occupied 
by the towns of Manchester, East Hartford, and West Hartford. In 1783, 
East Hartford became a separate town, which included Manchester in its 
city limits until 1823.[5] The Pitkin Glassworks operated from 1783-1830 
as the first successful glassworks in Connecticut. The Pitkin Glassworks 
Ruin have been preserved by a historical society. In 1838, the Cheney family 
started what became the world's largest silk mill. Eventually, Manchester 
became an ideal industrial community. The mills, houses of the owners, 
and homes of the workers are now part of the Cheney Brothers Historic District, 
a National Historic Landmark. Also of note are the E.E. Hilliard Company 
Woolen Mills. Founded ca. 1780 by Aaron Buckland and later sold to the
