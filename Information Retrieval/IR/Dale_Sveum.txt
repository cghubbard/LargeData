As player As manager As coach Dale Curtis Sveum (/ˈsweɪm/ SWAYM; born November 
23, 1963) is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) player and the former 
manager of the Chicago Cubs. He is currently the hitting coach for the 
Kansas City Royals. As a player, Sveum saw action in twelve major league 
seasons between 1986 and 1999. He was a member of the Milwaukee Brewers, 
Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners, 
Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Yankees. Following his playing career, 
Sveum managed in minor league baseball for several seasons before becoming 
an MLB coach. Sveum briefly served as manager of the Brewers in 2008. He 
was named manager of the Cubs after the 2011 season. During his time at 
Pinole Valley High School, Sveum was recognized as an All-State and All-American 
quarterback,[1] in addition to playing baseball. Drafted by the Milwaukee 
Brewers in the first round (25th pick) of the 1982 amateur draft, he went 
on to play 12 seasons in MLB, hitting .236 with 69 home runs.[1][2] Arguably, 
Sveum's finest season came in 1987, when he hit 25 home runs and drove 
in 95 runs, mostly as the Brewers' ninth hitter in the lineup. One of his 
personal highlights came early in the season, when he hit a walk-off home 
run at County Stadium to give Milwaukee a 6–4 victory over the Texas Rangers. 
This victory, which came on April 19 (Easter Sunday), led the Brewers to 
a 12–0 record on the season.[1][3] On July 17 Sveum totaled three homers 
and six RBIs during a 12–2 thumping of the California Angels.[1] On September 
3, 1988, Sveum was involved in a severe collision with fellow Brewer Darryl 
Hamilton. Sveum's leg was broken and he did not play again in 1988. He 
also sat out the entire 1989 MLB season,[1] while seeing action in 17 games 
in the minor leagues.[4] In his first three major league seasons, Sveum's 
lowest yearly batting average was .242 Following his return to the majors 
in 1990, he only batted over .241 twice in parts of nine seasons.[2] During 
his career Sveum had the distinction of playing for five separate managers 
who would (at some point in their careers) win a league Manager of the 
Year Award. Those managers were Tony La Russa ('83, '88, '92, '02), in 
Oakland; Joe Torre ('96, '98), in New York; Lou Piniella ('95, '01, '08), 
in Seattle; Jim Leyland ('90, '92, '96) in Pittsburgh; and Gene Lamont 
('93) with the Chicago White Sox.[1] Prior to coaching in Milwaukee, Sveum 
managed the Double A team in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization from 2001–2003, 
compiling a 213–211 record. In 2003, Baseball America tabbed Sveum as the 
best potential MLB manager in the Eastern League.[1] Sveum was on the coaching 
staff of the Boston Red Sox from 2004–05, serving as third base coach[1] 
and working under manager (and former Brewers teammate) Terry Francona. 
Following Sveum's second season in Boston, he left the Red Sox to rejoin 
Milwaukee as the team's bench coach.[1] On October 30, 2007, Sveum switched 
positions on the staff and became the team's third base coach.[5] On September 
15, 2008, he was named interim manager of the Milwaukee Brewers after manager 
Ned Yost was fired.[1] Sveum led the team to a 7–5 record to close out 
the 2008 regular season,[6] which was enough for the Brewers to make the 
playoffs for the first time since their World Series run in 1982.[7] Under 
Sveum's leadership, the Brewers lost the 2008 NLDS to the Philadelphia 
Phillies in 4 games.[8] As Ken Macha took over the Brewers for the 2009 
season, Sveum stayed on as the team's hitting coach. On November 16, 2011 
the Chicago Cubs offered Sveum their vacant managerial position.[9] The 
following day, on November 17, 2011, Sveum accepted an offer to become 
the new manager of the Chicago Cubs, and was introduced on November 18, 
2011, [10] but Sveum was fired on September 30, 2013. His total record 
with the Cubs in two years was 127-197. On October 3, 2013 the Kansas City 
Royals announced they had hired Sveum and added him to their 2014 coaching 
staff as third base coach. On May 29, 2014, the Royals promoted Sveum to 
hitting coach in an effort to improve a lackluster offensive start to the
