Robert Dale Johnson (April 25, 1943 in Aurora, Illinois) is a former professional 
baseball player. He was a pitcher over parts of seven seasons (1969–1974, 
1977) with the New York Mets, Kansas City Royals, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cleveland 
Indians and Atlanta Braves. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. 
Johnson was a member of the 1971 World Series champion Pirates. The 1971 
season was also his most productive, finishing 9–10 with a 3.45 ERA, including 
27 starts, seven complete games and one shutout. The Pirates faced the 
San Francisco Giants in the National League Championship Series that year, 
and with the 5-game series tied 1–1 after two games, Johnson started Game 
3. He out-dueled Juan Marichal at Three Rivers Stadium, pitching eight 
innings and allowing only one unearned run for the win. The Pirates went 
on to win Game 4 to reach the World Series for the first time in 11 years. 
Johnson did not fare as well in the World Series, losing Game 2 at Memorial 
Stadium against the Baltimore Orioles. An alumnus of Bradley University, 
for his career he compiled a 28–34 record with a 3.48 ERA and 507 strikeouts 
in 183 appearances, including 76 starts, 18 complete games, two shutouts, 
12 saves and 692 1⁄3 innings pitched. He garnered 15 hits in 157 at-bats
