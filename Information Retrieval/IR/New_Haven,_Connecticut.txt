New Haven (local /nuː ˈheɪvən/ noo-HAY-vən),[1] in the U.S. state of Connecticut, 
is the principal municipality in Greater New Haven, which had a total population 
of 862,477 in 2010.[2] It is located on New Haven Harbor on the northern 
shore of Long Island Sound in New Haven County, Connecticut, and is part 
of the New York metropolitan area. It is the second-largest city in Connecticut 
(after Bridgeport), with a population of 129,779 people as of the 2010 
United States Census.[3] According to a census of 1 July 2012, by the Census 
Bureau, the city had a population of 130,741. New Haven was founded in 
1638 by English Puritans, and a year later eight streets were laid out 
in a four-by-four grid, creating what is now commonly known as the "Nine 
Square Plan",[4] now recognized by the American Institute of Certified 
Planners as a National Planning Landmark. The central common block is New 
Haven Green, a 16-acre (6 ha) square, now a National Historic Landmark 
and the center of Downtown New Haven. New Haven is the home of Yale University. 
The university is an integral part of the city's economy, being New Haven's 
biggest taxpayer and employer.[5] Health care (hospitals and biotechnology), 
professional services (legal, architectural, marketing, and engineering), 
financial services, and retail trade also help to form an economic base 
for the city. The city served as co-capital of Connecticut from 1701 until 
1873, when sole governance was transferred to the more centrally located 
city of Hartford. New Haven has since billed itself as the "Cultural Capital 
of Connecticut" for its supply of established theaters, museums, and music 
venues. New Haven had the first public tree planting program in America, 
producing a canopy of mature trees (including some large elms) that gave 
New Haven the nickname "The Elm City".[6] Before Europeans arrived, the 
New Haven area was the home of the Quinnipiac tribe of Native Americans, 
who lived in villages around the harbor and subsisted off local fisheries 
and the farming of maize. The area was briefly visited by Dutch explorer 
Adriaen Block in 1614. Dutch traders set up a small trading system of beaver 
pelts with the local inhabitants, but trade was sporadic and the Dutch 
did not settle permanently in the area. In 1637 a small party of Puritans 
reconnoitered the New Haven harbor area and wintered over. In April 1638, 
the main party of five hundred Puritans who left the Massachusetts Bay 
Colony under the leadership of the Reverend John Davenport and the London 
merchant Theophilus Eaton sailed into the harbor. These settlers were hoping 
to establish a (in their mind) better theological community, with the government 
more closely linked to the church than the one they left in Massachusetts 
and sought to take advantage of the excellent port capabilities of the 
harbor. The Quinnipiacs, who were under attack by neighboring Pequots, 
sold their land to the settlers in return for protection. By 1640, the 
town's theocratic government and nine-square grid plan were in place, and 
the town was renamed Newhaven from Quinnipiac. However, the area north 
of New Haven remained Quinnipiac until 1678, when it was renamed Hamden. 
The settlement became the headquarters of the New Haven Colony. At the 
time, the New Haven Colony was separate from the Connecticut Colony, which 
had been established to the north centering on Hartford. One of the principal 
differences between the two colonies was that the New Haven colony was 
an intolerant theocracy that did not permit other churches to be established, 
while the Connecticut colony permitted the establishment of other churches. 
Economic disaster struck the colony in 1646, however, when the town sent 
its first fully loaded ship of local goods back to England. This ship never 
reached the Old World, and its disappearance stymied New Haven's development 
in the face of the rising trade power of Boston and New Amsterdam. In 1660, 
founder John Davenport's wishes were fulfilled, and Hopkins School was 
founded in New Haven with money from the estate of Edward Hopkins. In 1661, 
the judges who had signed the death warrant of Charles I of England were 
pursued by Charles II. Two judges, Colonel Edward Whalley and Colonel William 
Goffe, fled to New Haven to seek refuge from the king's forces. John Davenport 
arranged for these "Regicides" to hide in the West Rock hills northwest 
of the town. A third judge, John Dixwell, joined the other regicides at 
a later time. New Haven became part of the Connecticut Colony in 1664, 
when the two colonies were merged under political pressure from England, 
according to folklore as punishment for harboring the three judges (in 
reality, done in order to strengthen the case for the takeover of nearby 
New Amsterdam, which was rapidly losing territory to migrants from Connecticut).[citation 
needed] Some members of the New Haven Colony seeking to establish a new 
theocracy elsewhere went on to establish Newark, New Jersey. It was made 
co-capital of Connecticut in 1701, a status it retained until 1873. In 
1716, the Collegiate School relocated from Old Saybrook to New Haven and 
established New Haven as a center of learning. In 1718, the name of the 
Collegiate School was changed to Yale College in response to a large donation 
from British East India Company merchant Elihu Yale, former Governor of 
Madras. For over a century, New Haven citizens had fought in the colonial 
militia alongside regular British forces, as in the French and Indian War. 
As the American Revolution approached, General David Wooster and other 
influential residents hoped that the conflict with the government in Britain 
could be resolved short of rebellion. On 23 April 1775, which is still 
celebrated in New Haven as Powder House Day, the Second Company, Governor's 
Foot Guard, of New Haven entered the struggle against the governing British 
parliament. Under Captain Benedict Arnold, they broke into the powder house 
to arm themselves and began a three-day march to Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
Other New Haven militia members were on hand to escort George Washington 
from his overnight stay in New Haven on his way to Cambridge. Contemporary 
reports, from both sides, remark on the New Haven volunteers' professional 
military bearing, including uniforms. On July 5, 1779, 2,600 loyalists 
and British regulars under General William Tryon, governor of New York, 
landed in New Haven Harbor and raided the 3,500-person town. A militia 
of Yale students had been prepping for battle, and former Yale president 
and Yale Divinity School professor Naphtali Daggett rode out to confront 
the Redcoats. Yale president Ezra Stiles recounted in his diary that while 
he moved furniture in anticipation of battle, he still couldn't quite believe 
the revolution had begun.[7] New Haven was not torched as the invaders 
did with Danbury in 1777, or Fairfield and Norwalk a week after the New 
Haven raid, so many of the town's colonial features were preserved. New 
Haven was incorporated as a city in 1784, and Roger Sherman, one of the 
signers of the Constitution and author of the "Connecticut Compromise", 
became the new city's first mayor. The city struck fortune in the late 
18th century with the inventions and industrial activity of Eli Whitney, 
a Yale graduate who remained in New Haven to develop the cotton gin and 
establish a gun-manufacturing factory in the northern part of the city 
near the Hamden town line. That area is still known as Whitneyville, and 
the main road through both towns is known as Whitney Avenue. The factory 
is now the Eli Whitney Museum, which has a particular emphasis on activities 
for children and exhibits pertaining to the A. C. Gilbert Company. His 
factory, along with that of Simeon North, and the lively clock-making and 
brass hardware sectors, contributed to making early Connecticut a powerful 
manufacturing economy; so many arms manufacturers sprang up that the state 
became known as "The Arsenal of America". It was in Whitney's gun-manufacturing 
plant that Samuel Colt invented the automatic revolver in 1836. Many other 
talented machinists and firearms designers would go on to found successful 
firearms manufacturing companies in New Haven, including Oliver Winchester 
and O.F. Mossberg & Sons. The Farmington Canal, created in the early 19th 
century, was a short-lived transporter of goods into the interior regions 
of Connecticut and Massachusetts, and ran from New Haven to Northampton, 
Massachusetts. New Haven was home to one of the important early events 
in the burgeoning anti-slavery movement when, in 1839, the trial of mutineering 
Mende tribesmen being transported as slaves on the Spanish slaveship Amistad 
was held in New Haven's United States District Court.[9] There is a statue 
of Joseph Cinqué, the informal leader of the slaves, beside City Hall. 
See "Museums" below for more information. Abraham Lincoln delivered a speech 
on slavery in New Haven in 1860,[10] shortly before he secured the Republican 
nomination for President. The American Civil War boosted the local economy 
with wartime purchases of industrial goods, including that of the New Haven 
Arms Company, which would later become the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. 
(Winchester would continue to produce arms in New Haven until 2006, and 
many of the buildings that were a part of the Winchester plant are now 
a part of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company Historic District.[11]) 
After the war, population grew and doubled by the start of the 20th century, 
most notably due to the influx of immigrants from southern Europe, particularly 
Italy. Today, roughly half the populations of East Haven, West Haven, and 
North Haven are Italian-American. Jewish immigration to New Haven has left 
an enduring mark on the city. Westville was the center of Jewish life in 
New Haven, though today many have fanned out to suburban communities such 
as Woodbridge and Cheshire. New Haven's expansion continued during the 
two World Wars, with most new inhabitants being African Americans from 
the American South and Puerto Ricans. The city reached its peak population 
after World War II. The area of New Haven is only 17 square miles (44 km2), 
encouraging further development of new housing after 1950 in adjacent, 
suburban towns. Moreover, as in other U.S. cities in the 1950s, New Haven 
began to suffer from an exodus of middle-class workers. In 1954, then-mayor 
Richard C. Lee began some of the earliest major urban renewal projects 
in the United States. Certain sections of downtown New Haven were redeveloped 
to include museums, new office towers, a hotel, and large shopping complexes.[12] 
Other parts of the city were affected by the construction of Interstate 
95 along the Long Wharf section, Interstate 91, and the Oak Street Connector. 
The Oak Street Connector (Route 34), running between Interstate 95, downtown, 
and The Hill neighborhood, was originally intended as a highway to the 
city's western suburbs but was only completed as a highway to the downtown 
area, with the area to the west becoming a boulevard (See "Redevelopment" 
below). In 1970, a series of criminal prosecutions against various members 
of the Black Panther Party took place in New Haven, inciting mass protests 
on the New Haven Green involving twelve thousand demonstrators and many 
well-known New Left political activists. (See "Political Culture" below 
for more information). From the 1960s through the late 1990s, central areas 
of New Haven continued to decline both economically and in terms of population 
despite attempts to resurrect certain neighborhoods through renewal projects. 
In conjunction with its declining population, New Haven experienced a steep 
rise in its crime rate. In 2010, New Haven ranked as the 18th most dangerous 
city in America, albeit with crime rating under the significant safety 
benchmark of 200.00.[13] Since approximately 2000, many parts of downtown 
New Haven have been revitalized with new restaurants, nightlife, and small 
retail stores. In particular, the area surrounding the New Haven Green 
has experienced an influx of apartments and condominiums. In recent years, 
downtown retail options have increased with the opening of new stores such 
as Urban Oufitters, J Crew, Origins, American Apparel, Gant Clothing, and 
an Apple Store, joining older stores such as Barnes & Noble and Raggs Clothing. 
In addition, two new supermarkets opened to serve downtown's growing residential 
population. A Stop & Shop opened just west of downtown, while Elm City 
Market, located one block from the Green, opened in 2011.[14] The recent 
turnaround of downtown New Haven has received positive press from various 
periodicals.[15][16][17] Major projects include the current construction 
of a new campus for Gateway Community College downtown, and also a 32-story, 
500-unit apartment/retail building called 360 State Street. The 360 State 
Street project is now occupied and is the largest residential building 
in Connecticut.[18] A new boathouse and dock is planned for New Haven Harbor, 
and the linear park Farmington Canal Trail is set to extend into downtown 
New Haven within the coming year.[19] Additionally, foundation and ramp 
work to widen I-95 to create a new harbor crossing for New Haven, with 
an extradosed bridge to replace the 1950s-era Q Bridge, has begun.[20] 
The city still hopes to redevelop the site of the New Haven Coliseum, which 
was demolished in 2007. In April 2009, the United States Supreme Court 
agreed to hear a suit over reverse discrimination brought by 18 white firefighters 
against the city. The suit involved the 2003 promotion test for the New 
Haven Fire Department. After the tests were scored, no black firefighters 
scored high enough to qualify for consideration for promotion, so the city 
announced that no one would be promoted. In the subsequent Ricci v. DeStefano 
decision the court found 5-4 that New Haven's decision to ignore the test 
results violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[21] As a result, 
a district court subsequently ordered the city to promote 14 of the white 
firefighters.[22] In 2010 and 2011, state and federal funds were awarded 
to Connecticut (and Massachusetts) to construct the Hartford Line, with 
a southern terminus at New Haven's Union Station and a northern terminus 
at Springfield's Union Station.[23] According to the White House, "This 
corridor [currently] has one train per day connecting communities in Connecticut 
and Massachusetts to the Northeast Corridor and Vermont. The vision for 
this corridor is to restore the alignment to its original route via the 
Knowledge Corridor in western Massachusetts, improving trip time and increasing 
the population base that can be served."[24] Set for construction in 2013, 
the "Knowledge Corridor high speed intercity passenger rail" project will 
cost approximately $1 billion, and the ultimate northern terminus for the 
project is reported to be Montreal in Canada.[25] Train speeds between 
will reportedly exceed 110 miles per hour (180 km/h) and increase both 
cities' rail traffic exponentially.[26] The Greater New Haven Convention 
and Visitors Bureau has a more extensive list of New Haven firsts. According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 20.1 square 
miles (52.1 km2), of which 18.7 square miles (48.4 km2) is land and 1.4 
square miles (3.7 km2), or 6.67%, is water.[38] New Haven's best-known 
geographic features are its large deep harbor, and two reddish basalt trap 
rock ridges which rise to the northeast and northwest of the city core. 
These trap rocks are known respectively as East Rock and West Rock, and 
both serve as extensive parks. West Rock has been tunneled through to make 
way for the east-west passage of the Wilbur Cross Parkway (the only highway 
tunnel through a natural obstacle in Connecticut), and once served as the 
hideout of the "Regicides" (see: Regicides Trail). Most New Haveners refer 
to these men as "The Three Judges". East Rock features the prominent Soldiers 
and Sailors war monument on its peak as well as the "Great/Giant Steps" 
which run up the rock's cliffside. The city is drained by three rivers; 
the West, Mill, and Quinnipiac, named in order from west to east. The West 
River discharges into West Haven Harbor, while the Mill and Quinnipiac 
rivers discharge into New Haven Harbor. Both harbors are embayments of 
Long Island Sound. In addition, several smaller streams flow through the 
city's neighborhoods, including Wintergreen Brook, the Beaver Ponds Outlet, 
Wilmot Brook, Belden Brook, and Prospect Creek. Not all of these small 
streams have continuous flow year-round. New Haven lies in the transition 
between a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfa) 
and humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), typical of much of the New 
York metropolitan area. Summers are hot and often humid, with average temperatures 
exceeding 80 °F (27 °C) on 70 days per year. In summer, the Bermuda High 
creates as southern flow of warm and humid air, with frequent thundershowers. 
Fall and spring are normally mild and of equal length. Winters are moderately 
cold and both rain and snow fall in winter. The weather patterns that affect 
New Haven result from a primarily offshore direction, thus reducing the 
marine influence of Long Island Sound—although, like other marine areas, 
differences in temperature between areas right along the coastline and 
areas a mile or two inland can be large at times. During summer heat waves, 
temperatures may reach 95 °F (35 °C) or higher on occasion with heat-index 
values of over 100 °F (38 °C) New Haven has a long tradition of urban planning 
and a purposeful design for the city's layout. The city could be argued 
to have some of the first preconceived layouts in the country.[40][41] 
Upon founding, New Haven was laid out in a grid plan of nine square blocks; 
the central square was left open, in the tradition of many New England 
towns, as the city green (a commons area). The city also instituted the 
first public tree planting program in America. As in other cities, many 
of the elms that gave New Haven the nickname "Elm City" perished in the 
mid-20th century due to Dutch Elm disease, although many have since been 
replanted. The New Haven Green is currently home to three separate historic 
churches which speak to the original theocratic nature of the city.[4] 
The Green remains the social center of the city today. It was named a National 
Historic Landmark in 1970. Downtown New Haven, occupied by nearly 7,000 
residents, has a more residential character than most downtowns.[42] The 
downtown area provides about half of the city's jobs and half of its tax 
base[42] and in recent years has become filled with dozens of new upscale 
restaurants, several of which have garnered national praise (such as Ibiza, 
recognized by Esquire and Wine Spectator magazines as well as the New York 
Times as the best Spanish food in the country), in addition to shops and 
thousands of apartments and condominium units which subsequently help overall 
growth of the city.[43] The city has many distinct neighborhoods. In addition 
to Downtown, centered on the central business district and the Green, are 
the following neighborhoods: the west central neighborhoods of Dixwell 
and Dwight; the southern neighborhoods of The Hill, historic water-front 
City Point (or Oyster Point), and the harborside district of Long Wharf; 
the western neighborhoods of Edgewood, West River, Westville, Amity, and 
West Rock-Westhills; East Rock, Cedar Hill, Prospect Hill, and Newhallville 
in the northern side of town; the east central neighborhoods of Mill River 
and Wooster Square, an Italian-American neighborhood; Fair Haven, an immigrant 
community located between the Mill and Quinnipiac rivers; Quinnipiac Meadows 
and Fair Haven Heights across the Quinnipiac River; and facing the eastern 
side of the harbor, The Annex and East Shore (or Morris Cove).[44][45] 
New Haven's economy originally was based in manufacturing, but the postwar 
period brought rapid industrial decline; the entire Northeast was affected, 
and medium-sized cities with large working-class populations, like New 
Haven, were hit particularly hard. Simultaneously, the growth and expansion 
of Yale University further affected the economic shift. Today, over half 
(56%) of the city's economy is now made up of services, in particular education 
and health care; Yale is the city's largest employer, followed by Yale 
– New Haven Hospital. Other large employers include Southern Connecticut 
State University, Assa Abloy Manufacturing, the Knights of Columbus headquarters, 
Higher One, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Covidien and United Illuminating.[47] 
Yale and Yale-New Haven are also among the largest employers in the state, 
and provide more $100,000+-salaried positions than any other employer in 
Connecticut.[citation needed] Industry sectors: Agriculture (.6%), Construction 
and Mining (4.9%), Manufacturing (2.9%), Transportation and Utilities (2.9%), 
Trade (21.7%), Finance and Real Estate (7.1%), Services (55.9%), Government 
(4.0%) The Knights of Columbus, the world's largest Catholic fraternal 
service organization and a Fortune 1000 company, is headquartered in New 
Haven.[48] Two more Fortune 1000 companies are based in Greater New Haven: 
the electrical equipment producers Hubbell, based in Orange,[49] and Amphenol, 
based in Wallingford.[50] Eight Courant 100 companies are based in Greater 
New Haven, with four headquartered in New Haven proper.[51] New Haven-based 
companies traded on stock exchanges include NewAlliance Bank, the second 
largest bank in Connecticut and fourth-largest in New England (NYSE: NAL), 
Higher One Holdings (NYSE: ONE), a financial services firm United Illuminating, 
the electricity distributor for southern Connecticut (NYSE: UIL), Achillion 
Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ACHN), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NasdaqGS: ALXN), 
and Transpro Inc. (AMEX: TPR). Vion Pharmaceuticals is traded OTC (OTC 
BB: VIONQ.OB). Other notable companies based in the city include the Peter 
Paul Candy Manufacturing Company (the candy-making division of the Hershey 
Company), and the American division of Assa Abloy (one of the world's leading 
manufacturers of locks). The Southern New England Telephone Company (SNET) 
began operations in the city as the District Telephone Company of New Haven 
in 1878; the company remains headquartered in New Haven as a subsidiary 
of Frontier Communications and provides telephone service for all but two 
municipalities in Connecticut.[52] The U.S. Census Bureau reports a 2010 
population of 129,779, with 47,094 households and 25,854 families within 
the city of New Haven. The population density is 6,859.8 people per square 
mile (2,648.6/km²). There are 52,941 housing units at an average density 
of 2,808.5 per square mile (1,084.4/km²). The racial makeup of the city 
is 42.6% White, 35.4% African American, 0.5% Native American, 4.6% Asian, 
0.1% Pacific Islander, 12.9% from other races, and 3.9% from two or more 
races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 27.4% of the population.[54] 
Non-Hispanic Whites were 31.8% of the population in 2010,[55] down from 
69.6% in 1970.[56] The city's demography is shifting rapidly: New Haven 
has always been a city of immigrants and currently the Latino population 
is growing rapidly. Previous influxes among ethnic groups have been African-Americans 
in the postwar era, and Irish, Italian and (to a lesser degree) Slavic 
peoples in the prewar period. As of the 2010 census, of the 47,094 households, 
29.3% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 27.5% include 
married couples living together, 22.9% have a female householder with no 
husband present, and 45.1% are non-families. 36.1% of all households are 
made up of individuals and 10.5% have someone living alone who is 65 years 
of age or older. The average household size is 2.40 and the average family 
size 3.19.[57][58] The ages of New Haven's residents are 25.4% under the 
age of 18, 16.4% from 18 to 24, 31.2% from 25 to 44, 16.7% from 45 to 64, 
and 10.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age is 29 years, 
which is significantly lower than the national average. There are 91.8 
males per 100 females. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 
87.6 males. The median income for a household in the city is $29,604, and 
the median income for a family is $35,950. Median income for males is $33,605, 
compared with $28,424 for females. The per capita income for the city is 
$16,393. About 20.5% of families and 24.4% of the population live below 
the poverty line, including 32.2% of those under age 18 and 17.9% of those 
age 65 or over.[57][58] It is estimated that 14% of New Haven residents 
are pedestrian commuters, ranking it number four by highest percentage 
in the United States.[59] This is primarily due to New Haven's small area 
and the presence of Yale University. New Haven is a predominantly Roman 
Catholic city, as the city's Dominican, Irish, Italian, Mexican, Ecuadorian, 
and Puerto Rican populations are overwhelmingly Catholic. The city is part 
of the Archdiocese of Hartford. Jews also make up a considerable portion 
of the population, as do Black Baptists. There is a growing number of (mostly 
Puerto Rican) Pentecostals as well. There are churches for all major branches 
of Christianity within the city, multiple store-front churches, ministries 
(especially in working-class Latino and Black neighborhoods), a mosque, 
many synagogues (including two yeshivas), and other places of worship; 
the level of religious diversity in the city is high. A study of New Haven's 
demographics, based on age, educational attainment, and race and ethnicity, 
found that its demographics were the closest of any American city to the 
national average.[60] New Haven is governed via the mayor-council system. 
Connecticut municipalities (like those of neighboring states Massachusetts 
and Rhode Island) provide nearly all local services (such as fire and rescue, 
education, snow removal, etc.), as county government has been abolished 
since 1960.[61] New Haven County merely refers to a grouping of towns and 
a judicial district, not a governmental entity. New Haven is a member of 
the South Central Connecticut Regional Council of Governments (SCRCOG), 
a regional agency created to facilitate coordination between area municipal 
governments and state and federal agencies, in the absence of county government.[62] 
Toni Harp is the mayor of New Haven.[63] She was sworn in as the 50th mayor 
of New Haven on January 1, 2014 and is the first woman to hold that office. 
The city council, called the Board of Alders, consists of thirty members, 
each elected from single-member wards.[64][65] New Haven is served by the 
New Haven Police Department and the New Haven Fire Department. New Haven 
lies within Connecticut's 3rd congressional district and has been represented 
by Rosa DeLauro since 1991. Martin Looney and Gary Holder-Winfield represent 
New Haven in the Connecticut State Senate, and the city lies within six 
districts (numbers 92 through 97) of the Connecticut House of Representatives.[66] 
The Greater New Haven area is served by the New Haven Judicial District 
Court and the New Haven Superior Court, both headquartered at the New Haven 
County Courthouse.[67] The federal District Court for the District of Connecticut 
has a New Haven facility, the Richard C. Lee United States Courthouse. 
New Haven is the birthplace of former president George W. Bush,[68] who 
was born when his father, former president George H. W. Bush, was living 
in New Haven while a student at Yale. In addition to being the site of 
the college educations of both Presidents Bush, as Yale students, New Haven 
was also the temporary home of former presidents William Howard Taft, Gerald 
Ford, and Bill Clinton, as well as Secretary of State John Kerry. President 
Clinton met his wife, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while 
the two were students at Yale Law School. Former vice presidents John C. 
Calhoun and Dick Cheney also studied in New Haven (although the latter 
did not graduate from Yale). Before the 2008 election, the last time there 
was not a person with ties to New Haven and Yale on either major party's 
ticket was 1968. James Hillhouse, a New Haven native, served as President 
pro tempore of the United States Senate in 1801. A predominantly Democratic 
city, New Haven voters overwhelmingly supported Al Gore in the 2000 election, 
Yale graduate John Kerry in 2004,[69] and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. 
In the 2008 election, New Haven County was third among all Connecticut 
counties in campaign contributions, after Fairfield and Hartford counties. 
(Connecticut, in turn, was ranked 14th among all states in total campaign 
contributions.)[70][71] New Haven was the subject of Who Governs? Democracy 
and Power in An American City, a very influential book in political science 
by preeminent Yale professor Robert A. Dahl, which includes an extensive 
history of the city and thorough description of its politics in the 1950s. 
New Haven's theocratic history is also mentioned several times by Alexis 
de Tocqueville in his classic volume on 19th-century American political 
life, Democracy in America.[72] New Haven was the residence of conservative 
thinker William F. Buckley, Jr., in 1951, when he wrote his influential 
God and Man at Yale. William Lee Miller's The Fifteenth Ward and the Great 
Society (1966) similarly explores the relationship between local politics 
in New Haven and national political movements, focusing on Lyndon Johnson's 
Great Society and urban renewal.[73] George Williamson Crawford, a Yale 
Law School graduate, served as the city's first black corporation counsel 
from 1954 to 1962, under Mayor Richard C. Lee.[74] In 1970, the New Haven 
Black Panther trials took place, the largest and longest trials in Connecticut 
history. Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale and ten other Party 
members were tried for murdering an alleged informant. Beginning on May 
Day, the city became a center of protest for 12,000 Panther supporters, 
college students, and New Left activists (including Jean Genet, Benjamin 
Spock, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and John Froines), who amassed on the 
New Haven Green, across the street from where the trials were being held. 
Violent confrontations between the demonstrators and the New Haven police 
occurred, and several bombs were set off in the area by radicals. The event 
became a rallying point for the New Left and critics of the Nixon Administration.[75][76] 
During the summer of 2007, New Haven was the center of protests by anti-immigration 
groups who opposed the city's program of offering municipal ID cards, known 
as the Elm City Resident Card, to illegal immigrants.[77][78][79] In 2008, 
the country of Ecuador opened a consulate in New Haven to serve the large 
Ecuadorean immigrant population in the area. It is the first foreign mission 
to open in New Haven since Italy opened a consulate (now closed) in the 
city in 1910.[80][81] In April 2009, the United States Supreme Court agreed 
to hear a suit over reverse discrimination brought by 20 white and Hispanic 
firefighters against the city. The suit involved the 2003 promotion test 
for the New Haven Fire Department. After the tests were scored, no blacks 
scored high enough to qualify for consideration for promotion, so the city 
announced that no one would be promoted. On 29 June 2009, the United States 
Supreme Court ruled in favor of the firefighters, agreeing that they were 
improperly denied promotion because of their race.[82] The case, Ricci 
v. DeStefano, became highly publicized and brought national attention to 
New Haven politics due to the involvement of then-Supreme Court nominee 
(and Yale Law School graduate) Sonia Sotomayor in a lower court decision.[83] 
Garry Trudeau, creator of the political Doonesbury comic strip, attended 
Yale University. There he met fellow student and later Green Party candidate 
for Congress Charles Pillsbury, a long-time New Haven resident for whom 
Trudeau's comic strip is named. During his college years, Pillsbury was 
known by the nickname "The Doones". A theory of international law, which 
argues for a sociological normative approach in regards to jurisprudence, 
is named the New Haven Approach, after the city. Connecticut US senator 
Richard Blumenthal is a Yale graduate, as is former Connecticut US Senator 
Joe Lieberman who also was a New Haven resident for many years, before 
moving back to his hometown of Stamford.[84] Crime increased in the 1990s, 
with New Haven having one of the ten highest violent crime rates per capita 
in the United States.[85] In the late 1990s New Haven's crime began to 
stabilize. The city, adopting a policy of community policing, saw crime 
rates drop during the 2000s.[86][87] Violent crime levels vary dramatically 
between New Haven's neighborhoods, with some areas having crime rates in 
line with the state of Connecticut average, and others having extremely 
high rates of crime. A 2011 New Haven Health Department report identifies 
these issues in greater detail.[88] In 2010, New Haven ranked as the 18th 
most dangerous city in the United States (albeit below the safety benchmark 
of 200.00 for the second year in a row).[13] However, according to a completely 
different analysis conducted by the "24/7 Wall Street Blog", in 2011 New 
Haven had risen to become the fourth most dangerous city in the United 
States, and was widely cited in the press as such.[89][90] However, an 
analysis by the Regional Data Cooperative for Greater New Haven, Inc., 
has shown that due to issues of comparative denominators and other factors, 
such municipality-based rankings can be considered inaccurate.[91] For 
example, two cities of identical population can cover widely differing 
land areas, making such analyses irrelevant. The research organization 
called for comparisons based on neighborhoods, blocks, or standard methodologies 
(similar to those used by Brookings, DiversityData, and other established 
institutions), not based on municipalities. New Haven is a notable center 
for higher education. Yale University, at the heart of downtown, is one 
of the city's best known features and its largest employer.[92] New Haven 
is also home to Southern Connecticut State University, part of the Connecticut 
State University System, and Albertus Magnus College, a private institution. 
Gateway Community College has a campus in downtown New Haven, formerly 
located in the Long Wharf district; Gateway consolidated into one campus 
downtown into a new state-of-the-art campus (on the site of the old Macy's 
building) and was open for the Fall 2012 semester.[93][94] There are several 
institutions immediately outside of New Haven, as well. Quinnipiac University 
and the Paier College of Art are located just to the north, in the town 
of Hamden. The University of New Haven is located not in New Haven but 
in neighboring West Haven. New Haven Public Schools is the school district 
serving the city. Wilbur Cross High School and Hillhouse High School are 
New Haven's two largest public secondary schools. Hopkins School, a private 
school, was founded in 1660 and is the fifth-oldest educational institution 
in the United States.[95] New Haven is home to a number of other private 
schools as well as public magnet schools, including Metropolitan Business 
Academy, High School in the Community, Hill Regional Career High School, 
Co-op High School, New Haven Academy, ACES Educational Center for the Arts, 
the Foote School and the Sound School, all of which draw students from 
New Haven and suburban towns. New Haven is also home to two Achievement 
First charter schools, Amistad Academy and Elm City College Prep, and to 
Common Ground, an environmental charter school. The city is home to New 
Haven Promise, a scholarship funded by Yale University for students who 
meet the requirements. Students must be enrolled in a public high school 
(charters included) for four years, be a resident of the city during that 
time, carry a 3.0 cumulative grade-point average, have a 90-percent attendance 
rate and perform 40 hours of service to the city.[96] The initiative was 
launched in 2010 and there are currently more than 500 Scholars enrolled 
in qualifying Connecticut colleges and universities. There are more than 
60 cities in the country that have a Promise-type program for their students.[97] 
Livability.com named New Haven as the Best Foodie City in the country in 
2014. There are 56 Zagat-rated restaurants in New Haven, the most in Connecticut 
and the third most in New England (after Boston and Cambridge).[98] More 
than 120 restaurants are located within two blocks of the New Haven Green.[99] 
The city is home to an eclectic mix of ethnic restaurants and small markets 
specializing in various foreign foods.[100][101] Represented cuisines include 
Malaysian, Ethiopian, Spanish, Belgian, French, Greek, Latin American, 
Mexican, Italian, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian, 
Jamaican, Cuban, Peruvian, Syrian/Lebanese, and Turkish.[102] New Haven's 
greatest culinary claim to fame may be its pizza, which has been claimed 
to be among the best in the country,[103][104][105][106] or even in the 
world.[107][108] New Haven-style pizza, called "apizza" (pronounced ah-BEETS, 
[aˈpitts] in the original Italian dialect), made its debut at the iconic 
Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana (known as Pepe's) in 1925.[109] Apizza is 
baked in coal- or wood-fired brick ovens, and is notable for its thin crust. 
Apizza may be red (with a tomato-based sauce) or white (with a sauce of 
garlic and olive oil), and pies ordered "plain" are made without the otherwise 
customary mozzarella cheese (originally smoked mozzarella, known as "scamorza" 
in Italian). A white clam pie is a well-known specialty of the restaurants 
on Wooster Street in the Little Italy section of New Haven, including Pepe's 
and Sally's Apizza (which opened in 1938). Modern Apizza on State Street, 
which opened in 1934, is also well-known.[110] A second New Haven gastronomical 
claim to fame is Louis' Lunch, which is located in a small brick building 
on Crown Street and has been serving fast food since 1895.[111] Though 
fiercely debated, the restaurant's founder Louis Lassen is credited by 
the Library of Congress with inventing the hamburger and steak sandwich.[112][113] 
Louis' Lunch broils hamburgers, steak sandwiches and hot dogs vertically 
in original antique 1898 cast iron stoves using gridirons, patented by 
local resident Luigi Pieragostini in 1939, that hold the meat in place 
while it cooks.[114] New Haven is home to Miya's Sushi, the first sustainable 
sushi restaurant in the world. Miya's offers the largest vegetarian sushi 
menu in the world.[115][116][117] During weekday lunchtime, over 150 lunch 
carts and food trucks from neighborhood restaurants cater to different 
student populations throughout Yale's campus.[118] The carts cluster at 
three main points: by Yale – New Haven Hospital in the center of the Hospital 
Green (Cedar and York streets), by Yale's Trumbull College (Elm and York 
streets), and on the intersection of Prospect and Sachem streets by the 
Yale School of Management.[119] Popular farmers' markets, managed by the 
local non-profit CitySeed, set up shop weekly in several neighborhoods, 
including Westville/Edgewood Park, Fair Haven, Upper State Street, Wooster 
Square, and Downtown/New Haven Green. A large grocery store, the Elm City 
Market, opened on 360 State Street in New Haven in early fall 2011 and 
served local produce and groceries to the community. Originally, the market 
was a member-owned co-op,[120] but debt defaults in August 2014 forced 
a sale of the business. It is now an employee-owned business; the co-op's 
previous owners received no equity in the new business.[121] In the past 
several years, two separate Downtown food tour companies have started offering 
popular restaurant tours on weekends. Taste of New Haven Tours offers several 
different weekly restaurant/bar tours and a popular pizza, bike, and pints 
tour. Culinary Walking Tours offers monthly restaurant tours and sponsors 
an annual Elm City Iron Chef competition. The city hosts numerous theatres 
and production houses, including the Yale Repertory Theatre, the Long Wharf 
Theatre, and the Shubert Theatre. There is also theatre activity from the 
Yale School of Drama, which works through the Yale University Theatre and 
the student-run Yale Cabaret. Southern Connecticut State University hosts 
the Lyman Center for the Performing Arts. The shuttered Palace Theatre 
(opposite the Shubert Theatre) is being renovated and will reopen as the 
College Street Music Hall in May, 2015. Smaller theatres include the Little 
Theater on Lincoln Street. Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School 
also boasts a state-of-the-art theatre on College Street. The theatre is 
used for student productions as well as the home to weekly services to 
a local non-denominational church, the City Church New Haven.[122] The 
Shubert Theatre once premiered many major theatrical productions before 
their Broadway debuts. Productions that premiered at the Shubert include 
Oklahoma! (which was also written in New Haven[123]), Carousel, South Pacific, 
My Fair Lady, The King and I, and The Sound of Music, as well as the Tennessee 
Williams play A Streetcar Named Desire. Bow Tie Cinemas owns and operates 
the Criterion Cinemas, the first new movie theater to open in New Haven 
in over 30 years and the first luxury movie complex in the city's history. 
The Criterion has seven screens and opened in November 2004, showing a 
mix of upscale first run commercial and independent film.[124] New Haven 
has a variety of museums, many of them associated with Yale. The Beinecke 
Rare Book and Manuscript Library features an original copy of the Gutenberg 
Bible. There is also the Connecticut Children's Museum; the Knights of 
Columbus museum near that organization's world headquarters; the Peabody 
Museum of Natural History; the Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments; 
the Eli Whitney Museum (across the town line in Hamden, Connecticut, on 
Whitney Avenue); the Yale Center for British Art, which houses the largest 
collection of British art outside the U.K.,[125] and the Yale University 
Art Gallery, the nation's oldest college art museum.[citation needed] New 
Haven is also home to the New Haven Museum and Historical Society on Whitney 
Avenue, which has a library of many primary source treasures dating from 
Colonial times to the present. Artspace on Orange Street is one of several 
contemporary art galleries around the city, showcasing the work of local, 
national, and international artists. Others include City Gallery and A. 
Leaf Gallery in the downtown area. Westville galleries include Kehler Liddell, 
Jennifer Jane Gallery, and The Hungry Eye. The Erector Square complex in 
the Fair Haven neighborhood houses the Parachute Factory gallery along 
with numerous artist studios, and the complex serves as an active destination 
during City-Wide Open Studios held yearly in October. New Haven is the 
home port of a life-size replica of the historical Freedom Schooner Amistad, 
which is open for tours at Long Wharf pier at certain times during the 
summer. Also at Long Wharf pier is the Quinnipiack schooner, offering sailing 
cruises of the harbor area throughout the summer. The Quinnipiack also 
functions as a floating classroom for hundreds of local students. The New 
Haven Green is the site of many free music concerts, especially during 
the summer months. These have included the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, 
the July Free Concerts on the Green in July, and the New Haven Jazz Festival 
in August. The Jazz Festival, which began in 1982, is one of the longest-running 
free outdoor festivals in the U.S., until it was canceled for 2007. Headliners 
such as The Breakfast, Dave Brubeck, Ray Charles and Celia Cruz have historically 
drawn 30,000 to 50,000 fans, filling up the New Haven Green to capacity. 
The New Haven Jazz Festival was revived in 2008 and has been sponsored 
since by Jazz Haven.[126] New Haven is home to the concert venue Toad's 
Place, and a new venue, College Street Music Hall. The city has retained 
an alternative art and music underground that has helped to influence post-punk 
era music movements such as indie, college rock and underground hip-hop. 
Other local venues include Cafe Nine, BAR, Pacific Standard Tavern, Stella 
Blues, Three Sheets, Firehouse 12, and Rudy's. The Yale School of Music 
contributes to the city's music scene by offering hundreds of free concerts 
throughout the year at venues in and around the Yale campus. Large performances 
are held in the 2,700-seat Woolsey Hall auditorium, which contains the 
world's largest symphonic organs, while chamber music and recitals are 
performed in Sprague Hall. Hardcore band Hatebreed are from Wallingford, 
but got their start in New Haven under the name Jasta 14. The band Miracle 
Legion formed in New Haven in 1983. In addition to the Jazz Festival (described 
above), New Haven serves as the home city of the annual International Festival 
of Arts and Ideas. New Haven's Saint Patrick's Day parade, which began 
in 1842, is New England's oldest St. Patty's Day parade and draws the largest 
crowds of any one-day spectator event in Connecticut.[127] The St. Andrew 
the Apostle Italian Festival has taken place in the historic Wooster Square 
neighborhood every year since 1900. Other parishes in the city celebrate 
the Feast of Saint Anthony of Padua and a carnival in honor of St. Bernadette 
Soubirous.[128] New Haven celebrates Powder House Day every April on the 
New Haven Green to commemorate the city's entrance into the Revolutionary 
War. The annual Wooster Square Cherry Blossom Festival commemorates the 
1973 planting of 72 Yoshino Japanese Cherry Blossom trees by the New Haven 
Historic Commission in collaboration with the New Haven Parks Department 
and residents of the neighborhood. The Festival now draws well over 5,000 
visitors. The Film Fest New Haven has been held annually since 1995. In 
the past decade downtown has seen an influx of new restaurants, bars, and 
nightclubs. Large crowds are drawn to the Crown Street area downtown on 
weekends where many of the restaurants and bars are located. Crown Street 
between State and High streets has dozens of establishments, as do nearby 
Temple and College streets. Away from downtown, Upper State Street has 
a number of restaurants and bars popular with local residents and weekend 
visitors. New Haven is served by the daily New Haven Register, the weekly 
"alternative" New Haven Advocate (which is run by Tribune, the corporation 
owning the Hartford Courant), the online daily New Haven Independent,[129] 
and the monthly Grand News Community Newspaper. Downtown New Haven is covered 
by an in-depth civic news forum, Design New Haven. The Register also backs 
PLAY magazine, a weekly entertainment publication. The city is also served 
by several student-run papers, including the Yale Daily News, the weekly 
Yale Herald and a humor tabloid, Rumpus Magazine. WTNH Channel 8, the ABC 
affiliate for Connecticut, WCTX Channel 59, the MyNetworkTV affiliate for 
the state, and Connecticut Public Television station WEDY channel 65, a 
PBS affiliate, broadcast from New Haven. All New York City news and sports 
team stations broadcast to New Haven County. New Haven has a history of 
professional sports franchises dating back to the 19th century[130] and 
has been the home to professional baseball, basketball, football, hockey, 
and soccer teams—including the New York Giants of the National Football 
League from 1973 to 1974, who played at the Yale Bowl. Throughout the second 
half of the 20th century, New Haven consistently had minor league hockey 
and baseball teams, which played at the New Haven Arena (built in 1926, 
demolished in 1972), New Haven Coliseum (1972–2002), and Yale Field (1928–present). 
When John DeStefano, Jr., became mayor of New Haven in 1995, he outlined 
a plan to transform the city into a major cultural and arts center in the 
Northeast, which involved investments in programs and projects other than 
sports franchises. As nearby Bridgeport built new sports facilities, the 
brutalist New Haven Coliseum rapidly deteriorated. Believing the upkeep 
on the venue to be a drain of tax dollars, the DeStefano administration 
closed the Coliseum in 2002; it was demolished in 2007. New Haven's last 
professional sports team, the New Haven County Cutters, left in 2009. The 
DeStefano administration did, however, see the construction of the New 
Haven Athletic Center in 1998, a 94,000-square-foot (8,700 m2) indoor athletic 
facility with a seating capacity of over 3,000. The NHAC, built adjacent 
to Hillhouse High School, is used for New Haven public schools athletics, 
as well as large-scale area and state sporting events; it is the largest 
high school indoor sports complex in the state.[131][132][133] New Haven 
was the host of the 1995 Special Olympics World Summer Games; then-President 
Bill Clinton spoke at the opening ceremonies.[134] The city is home to 
the Pilot Pen International tennis event, which takes place every August 
at the Connecticut Tennis Center, one of the largest tennis venues in the 
world.[135] New Haven biannually hosts "The Game" between Yale and Harvard, 
the country's second-oldest college football rivalry. Numerous road races 
take place in New Haven, including the USA 20K Championship during the 
New Haven Road Race.[136] Greater New Haven is home to a number of college 
sports teams. The Yale Bulldogs play Division I college sports, as do the 
Quinnipiac Bobcats in neighboring Hamden. Division II athletics are played 
by Southern Connecticut State University and the University of New Haven 
(actually located in neighboring West Haven), while Albertus Magnus College 
athletes perform at the Division III level. New Haven is home to many New 
York Yankees fans due to the proximity of New York City.[137] Walter Camp, 
deemed the "father of American football," was a New Havener. The New Haven 
Warriors rugby league team play in the AMNRL. They have a large number 
of Pacific Islanders playing for them.[138] Their field is located at the 
West Haven High School's Ken Strong Stadium.[139] They won the 2008 AMNRL 
Grand Final.[140] New Haven has many architectural landmarks dating from 
every important time period and architectural style in American history. 
The city has been home to a number of architects and architectural firms 
that have left their mark on the city including Ithiel Town and Henry Austin 
in the 19th century and Cesar Pelli, Warren Platner, Kevin Roche, Herbert 
Newman and Barry Svigals in the 20th. The Yale School of Architecture has 
fostered this important component of the city's economy. Cass Gilbert, 
of the Beaux-Arts school, designed New Haven's Union Station and the New 
Haven Free Public Library and was also commissioned for a City Beautiful 
plan in 1919. Frank Lloyd Wright, Marcel Breuer, Alexander Jackson Davis, 
Philip C. Johnson, Gordon Bunshaft, Louis Kahn, James Gamble Rogers, Frank 
Gehry, Charles Willard Moore, Stefan Behnisch, James Polshek, Paul Rudolph, 
Eero Saarinen and Robert Venturi all have designed buildings in New Haven. 
Yale's 1950s-era Ingalls Rink, designed by Eero Saarinen, was included 
on the America's Favorite Architecture list created in 2007.[141] Many 
of the city's neighborhoods are well-preserved as walkable "museums" of 
19th- and 20th-century American architecture, particularly by the New Haven 
Green, Hillhouse Avenue and other residential sections close to Downtown 
New Haven. Overall, a large proportion of the city's land area is National 
(NRHP) historic districts. One of the best sources on local architecture 
is New Haven: Architecture and Urban Design, by Elizabeth Mills Brown.[142] 
The five tallest buildings in New Haven are:[143] Many historical sites 
exist throughout the city, including 59 properties listed on the National 
Register of Historic Places. Of these, nine are among the 60 U.S. National 
Historic Landmarks in Connecticut. The New Haven Green, one of the National 
Historic Landmarks, was formed in 1638, and is home to three 19th-century 
churches. Below one of the churches (referred to as the Center Church on-the-Green) 
lies a 17th-century crypt, which is open to visitors.[144] Some of the 
more famous burials include the first wife of Benedict Arnold and the aunt 
and grandmother of President Rutherford B. Hayes; Hayes visited the crypt 
while President in 1880.[145] The Old Campus of Yale University is located 
next to the Green, and includes Connecticut Hall, Yale's oldest building 
and a National Historic Landmark. The Hillhouse Avenue area, which is listed 
on the National Register of Historic Places and is also a part of Yale's 
campus, has been called a walkable museum, due to its 19th-century mansions 
and street scape; Charles Dickens is said to have called Hillhouse Avenue 
"the most beautiful street in America" when visiting the city in 1868.[146] 
In 1660, Edward Whalley (a cousin and friend of Oliver Cromwell) and William 
Goffe, two English Civil War generals who signed the death warrant of King 
Charles I, hid in a rock formation in New Haven after having fled England 
upon the restoration of Charles II to the English throne.[147] They were 
later joined by a third regicide, John Dixwell. The rock formation, which 
is now a part of West Rock Park, is known as Judges' Cave, and the path 
leading to the cave is called the Regicides Trail. After the American Revolutionary 
War broke out in 1776, the Connecticut colonial government ordered the 
construction of Black Rock Fort (to be built on top of an older 17th-century 
fort) to protect the port of New Haven. In 1779, during the Battle of New 
Haven, British soldiers captured Black Rock Fort and burned the barracks 
to the ground. The fort was reconstructed in 1807 by the federal government 
(on orders from the Thomas Jefferson administration), and rechristened 
Fort Nathan Hale, after the Revolutionary War hero who had lived in New 
Haven. The cannons of Fort Nathan Hale were successful in defying British 
war ships during the War of 1812. In 1863, during the Civil War, a second 
Fort Hale was built next to the original, complete with bomb-resistant 
bunkers and a moat, to defend the city should a Southern raid against New 
Haven be launched. The United States Congress deeded the site to the state 
in 1921, and all three versions of the fort have been restored. The site 
is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places and receives 
thousands of visitors each year.[148][149] Grove Street Cemetery, a National 
Historic Landmark which lies adjacent to Yale's campus, contains the graves 
of Roger Sherman, Eli Whitney, Noah Webster, Josiah Willard Gibbs, Charles 
Goodyear and Walter Camp, among other notable burials.[150] The cemetery 
is known for its grand Egyptian Revival gateway. The Union League Club 
of New Haven building, located on Chapel Street, is notable for not only 
being a historic Beaux-Arts building, but also is built on the site where 
Roger Sherman's home once stood; George Washington is known to have stayed 
at the Sherman residence while President in 1789 (one of three times Washington 
visited New Haven throughout his lifetime).[151][152] Two sites pay homage 
to the time President and Chief Justice William Howard Taft lived in the 
city, as both a student and later Professor at Yale: a plaque on Prospect 
Street marks the site where Taft's home formerly stood,[153] and downtown's 
Taft Apartment Building (formerly the Taft Hotel) bears the name of the 
former President who resided in the building for eight years before becoming 
Chief Justice of the United States.[123] Lighthouse Point Park, a public 
beach run by the city, was a popular tourist destination during the Roaring 
Twenties, attracting luminaries of the period such as Babe Ruth and Ty 
Cobb.[154] The park remains popular among New Haveners, and is home to 
the Five Mile Point Lighthouse, constructed in 1847, and the Lighthouse 
Point Carousel, constructed in 1916.[155][156] Five Mile Point Light was 
decommissioned in 1877 following the construction of Southwest Ledge Light 
at the entrance of the harbor, which remains in service to this day. Both 
of the lighthouses and the carousel are listed on the National Register 
of Historic Places. Other historic sites in the city include the Soldiers 
and Sailors Monument, which stands at the summit of East Rock, the Marsh 
Botanical Garden, Wooster Square, Dwight Street, Louis' Lunch, and the 
Farmington Canal, all of which date back to the 19th century. Other historic 
parks besides the Green include Edgerton Park, Edgewood Park, and East 
Rock Park, each of which is included on the National Register of Historic 
Places. New Haven is connected to New York City by commuter rail, regional 
rail and inter-city rail, provided by Metro-North Railroad (commuter rail), 
Shore Line East (commuter rail), and Amtrak (regional and intercity rail) 
respectively, allowing New Haven residents to commute to work in New York 
City (just under two hours by train). The city's main railroad station 
is the historic Beaux-arts Union Station, which serves Metro-North trains 
to New York and Shore Line East commuter trains to New London. An additional 
station was opened in 2002, named State Street Station, to provide Shore 
Line East and a few peak-hour Metro-North passengers easier access to and 
from Downtown. Union Station is further served by four Amtrak lines: the 
Northeast Regional and the high-speed Acela Express provide service to 
New York, Washington, D.C. and Boston, and rank as the first and second 
busiest routes in the country; the New Haven–Springfield Line provides 
service to Hartford and Springfield, Massachusetts; and the Vermonter provides 
service to both Washington, D.C., and Vermont, 15 miles (24 km) from the 
Canada–US border. Amtrak also codeshares with United Airlines for travel 
to any airport serviced by United Airlines, via Newark Airport (EWR) originating 
from or terminating at Union Station, (IATA: ZVE). Metro-North has the 
third highest daily ridership among commuter rails in the country, with 
an average weekday ridership of 276,000 in 2009. Of the 276,000 Metro-North 
riders, 112,000 rode the New Haven Line each day, which would make the 
New Haven Line seventh in the country in daily ridership if it were alone 
an entire commuter rail system. Shore Line East ranked nineteenth in the 
country, with an average daily ridership of 2,000.[157] Additionally, the 
Connecticut Department of Transportation plans to add a new commuter service 
called the Hartford Line in collaboration with Amtrak and the federal government 
that will run between New Haven and Springfield, Massachusetts with a terminus 
at Union Station in Downtown New Haven. As of late 2015, funding had been 
secured and the service is scheduled to begin operation in early 2018.[158] 
The New Haven Division of Connecticut Transit (CT Transit), the state's 
bus system, is the second largest division in the state with 24 routes. 
All routes originate from the New Haven Green, making it the central transfer 
hub of the city. Service is provided to 19 different municipalities throughout 
Greater New Haven. CT Transit's Union Station Shuttle provides free service 
from Union Station to the New Haven Green and several New Haven parking 
garages. Peter Pan and Greyhound bus lines have scheduled stops at Union 
Station, and connections downtown can be made via the Union Station Shuttle. 
A private company operates the New Haven/Hartford Express which provides 
commuter bus service to Hartford. The Yale University Shuttle provides 
free transportation around New Haven for Yale students, faculty, and staff. 
The New Haven Division buses follow routes that had originally been covered 
by trolley service. Horse-drawn steetcars began operating in New Haven 
in the 1860s, and by the mid-1890s all the lines had become electric. In 
the 1920s and 1930s, some of the trolley lines began to be replaced by 
bus lines, with the last trolley route converted to bus in 1948. The City 
of New Haven is in the very early stages of considering the restoration 
of streetcar (light-rail) service, which has been absent since the postwar 
period.[159][160][161][162] The Farmington Canal Trail is a rail trail 
that will eventually run continuously from downtown New Haven to Northampton, 
Massachusetts. The scenic trail follows the path of the historic New Haven 
and Northampton Company and the Farmington Canal. Currently, there is a 
continuous 14-mile (23 km) stretch of the trail from downtown, through 
Hamden and into Cheshire, making bicycle commuting between New Haven and 
those suburbs possible. The trail is part of the East Coast Greenway, a 
proposed 3,000-mile (4,800 km) bike path that would link every major city 
on the East Coast from Florida to Maine. In 2004, the first bike lane in 
the city was added to Orange Street, connecting East Rock Park and the 
East Rock neighborhood to downtown. Since then, bike lanes have also been 
added to sections of Howard Ave, Elm St, Dixwell Avenue, Water Street, 
Clinton Avenue and State Street. The city has created recommended bike 
routes for getting around New Haven, including use of the Canal Trail and 
the Orange Street lane.[163] As of the end of 2012, bicycle lanes have 
also been added in both directions on Dixwell Avenue along most of the 
street from downtown to the Hamden town line, as well as along Howard Avenue 
from Yale New Haven Hospital to City Point. The city has plans to create 
two additional bike lanes connecting Union Station with downtown, and the 
Westville neighborhood with downtown. The city has added dozens of covered 
bike parking spots at Union Station, in order to facilitate more bike commuting 
to the station.[164] New Haven lies at the intersection of Interstate 95 
on the coast—which provides access southwards and/or westwards to the western 
coast of Connecticut and to New York City, and eastwards to the eastern 
Connecticut shoreline, Rhode Island, and eastern Massachusetts—and Interstate 
91, which leads northward to the interior of Massachusetts and Vermont 
and the Canada–US border. I-95 is infamous for traffic jams increasing 
with proximity to New York City; on the east side of New Haven it passes 
over the Quinnipiac River via the Pearl Harbor Memorial, or "Q Bridge", 
which often presents a major bottleneck to traffic. I-91, however, is relatively 
less congested, except at the intersection with I-95 during peak travel 
times. The Oak Street Connector (Connecticut Route 34) intersects I-91 
at exit 1, just south of the I-95/I-91 interchange, and runs northwest 
for a few blocks as an expressway spur into downtown before emptying onto 
surface roads. The Wilbur Cross Parkway (Connecticut Route 15) runs parallel 
to I-95 west of New Haven, turning northwards as it nears the city and 
then running northwards parallel to I-91 through the outer rim of New Haven 
and Hamden, offering an alternative to the I-95/I-91 journey (restricted 
to non-commercial vehicles). Route 15 in New Haven is the site of the only 
highway tunnel in the state (officially designated as Heroes Tunnel), running 
through West Rock, home to West Rock Park and the Three Judges Cave. The 
city also has several major surface arteries. U.S. Route 1 (Columbus Avenue, 
Union Avenue, Water Street, Forbes Avenue) runs in an east-west direction 
south of downtown serving Union Station and leading out of the city to 
Milford, West Haven, East Haven and Branford. The main road from downtown 
heading northwest is Whalley Avenue (partly signed as Route 10 and Route 
63) leading to Westville and Woodbridge. Heading north towards Hamden, 
there are two major thoroughfares, Dixwell Avenue and Whitney Avenue. To 
the northeast are Middletown Avenue (Route 17), which leads to the Montowese 
section of North Haven, and Foxon Boulevard (Route 80), which leads to 
the Foxon section of East Haven and to the town of North Branford. To the 
west is Route 34, which leads to the city of Derby. Other major intracity 
arteries are Ella Grasso Boulevard (Route 10) west of downtown, and College 
Street, Temple Street, Church Street, Elm Street, and Grove Street in the 
downtown area. Traffic safety is a major concern for drivers, pedestrians 
and cyclists in New Haven.[165] In addition to many traffic-related fatalities 
in the city each year, since 2005, over a dozen Yale students, staff and 
faculty have been killed or injured in traffic collisions on or near the 
campus.[166] Tweed New Haven Regional Airport is located within the city 
limits 3 miles (5 km) east of the business district, and provides daily 
service to Philadelphia through American Eagle. Bus service between Downtown 
New Haven and Tweed is available via the CT Transit New Haven Division 
Bus "G". Taxi service and rental cars (including service by Hertz, Avis, 
Enterprise and Budget) are available at the airport. Travel time from Tweed 
to downtown takes less than 15 minutes by car. New Haven Harbor is home 
to the Port of New Haven, a deep-water seaport with three berths capable 
of hosting vessels and barges as well as the facilities required to handle 
break bulk cargo. The port has the capacity to load 200 trucks a day from 
the ground or via loading docks. Rail transportation access is available, 
with a private switch engine for yard movements and private siding for 
loading and unloading. Approximately 400,000 square feet (40,000 m2) of 
inside storage and 50 acres (200,000 m2) of outside storage are available 
at the site. Five shore cranes with a 250-ton capacity and 26 forklifts, 
each with a 26-ton capacity, are also available.[47] In June 17, 2013, 
the city commissioned the Nathan Hale, a 36 foot (11 m) Port Security vessel 
capable of serving search and rescue, firefighting, constabulary roles.[167][168] 
The New Haven area supports several medical facilities that are considered 
some of the best hospitals in the country. There are two major medical 
centers downtown: Yale – New Haven Hospital has four pavilions, including 
the Yale – New Haven Children's Hospital[169] and the Smilow Cancer Hospital;[170] 
the Hospital of Saint Raphael is several blocks north, and touts its excellent 
cardiac emergency care program. Smaller downtown health facilities are 
the Temple Medical Center located downtown on Temple Street, Connecticut 
Mental Health Center/[171] across Park Street from Y-NHH, and the Hill 
Health Center,[172] which serves the working-class Hill neighborhood. A 
large Veterans Affairs hospital is located in neighboring West Haven. To 
the west in Milford is Milford Hospital, and to the north in Meriden is 
the MidState Medical Center.[173] Yale and New Haven are working to build 
a medical and biotechnology research hub in the city and Greater New Haven 
region, and are succeeding to some extent.[citation needed] The city, state 
and Yale together run Science Park,[174] a large site three blocks northwest 
of Yale's Science Hill campus.[175] This multi-block site, approximately 
bordered by Mansfield Street, Division Street, and Shelton Avenue, is the 
former home of Winchester's and Olin Corporation's 45 large-scale factory 
buildings. Currently, sections of the site are large-scale parking lots 
or abandoned structures, but there is also a large remodeled and functioning 
area of buildings (leased primarily by a private developer) with numerous 
Yale employees, financial service and biotech companies. A second biotechnology 
district is being planned for the median strip on Frontage Road, on land 
cleared for the never-built Route 34 extension.[175] As of late 2009, a 
Pfizer drug-testing clinic, a medical laboratory building serving Yale 
– New Haven Hospital, and a mixed-use structure containing parking, housing 
and office space, have been constructed on this corridor.[175] A former 
SNET telephone building at 300 George Street is being converted into lab 
space, and has been so far quite successful in attracting biotechnology 
and medical firms.[175] Electricity for New Haven is generated by a 448 MW 
oil and gas-fired generating station located on the shore at New Haven 
Harbor.[176] In addition, Pennsylvania Power and Light (PPL) Inc. operates 
a 220 MW peaking natural gas turbine plant in nearby Wallingford. Near 
New Haven there is the static inverter plant of the HVDC Cross Sound Cable. 
There are three PureCell Model 400 fuel cells placed in the city of New 
Haven—one at the New Haven Public Schools and newly constructed Roberto 
Clemente School,[177] one at the mixed-use 360 State Street building,[178] 
and one at City Hall.[179] According to Giovanni Zinn of the city's Office 
of Sustainability, each fuel cell may save the city up to $1 million in 
energy costs over a decade.[180] The fuel cells were provided by ClearEdge 
Power,[181] formerly UTC Power.[182] Several recent movies have been filmed 
in New Haven, including Mona Lisa Smile (2003), with Julia Roberts, The 
Life Before Her Eyes (2007), with Uma Thurman, and Indiana Jones and the 
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) directed by Steven Spielberg and starring 
Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett and Shia LaBeouf.[183] The filming of Crystal 
Skull involved an extensive chase sequence through the streets of New Haven. 
Several downtown streets were closed to traffic and received a "makeover" 
to look like streets of 1957, when the film is set. 500 locals were cast 
as extras for the film.[184][185] In Everybody's Fine (2009), Robert De 
Niro has a close encounter in what is supposed to be the Denver train station; 
the scene was filmed in New Haven's Union Station. New Haven has seven 
sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International: Some of these 
were selected because of historical connection—Freetown because of the 
Amistad trial. Others, such as Amalfi and Afula-Gilboa, reflect ethnic 
groups in New Haven. In 1990, the United Nations named New Haven a "Peace
