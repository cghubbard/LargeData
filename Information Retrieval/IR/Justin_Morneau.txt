Justin Ernest George Morneau (born May 15, 1981) is a Canadian professional 
baseball designated hitter who is a free agent. He has played in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Minnesota Twins, Colorado 
Rockies and Chicago White Sox. At 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and 220 pounds 
(100 kg), Morneau was drafted as a catcher by the Twins in 1999. He converted 
to first base in the minor leagues and made his MLB debut in 2003. Morneau 
has held that position throughout his career and in 2007 became the first 
Twin since Gary Gaetti in 1987–1988 to hit 30 home runs in consecutive 
seasons. A four-time All-Star, Morneau was named the American League (AL) 
Most Valuable Player (MVP) during the 2006 season by helping the Twins 
win their fourth division title in five years. He finished runner-up for 
MVP in 2008 and won two Silver Slugger Awards. Additionally, Morneau won 
the 2008 Home Run Derby and the 2014 National League (NL) batting title. 
Internationally, Morneau represented Canada at the 2006, 2009, and 2013 
World Baseball Classic. Midway through the 2010 season, Morneau suffered 
a concussion while sliding into second base. The injury sidelined him for 
the remainder of the regular season and playoffs. Up to that point, he 
was the fan voted leader to start the All-Star Game at first base and a 
leading candidate for his second AL MVP award. Despite making the opening 
day roster in 2011, Morneau dealt with numerous injuries and sustained 
another concussion during the season that limited his production. Morneau 
has recovered from his ailments and has since split time between designated 
hitter and first base. Morneau is the youngest son of George Morneau, a 
hitting coach for many softball and baseball teams, childcare worker, and 
sporting goods store owner. His mother Audra Sinclair is an elementary 
school teacher and former fast-pitch softball player. Justin has an older 
brother, Geordie. His father once played hockey for the Brandon Wheat Kings 
and attended the training camp of the Minnesota North Stars. Morneau grew 
up in New Westminster, British Columbia, the historic "Royal City", adjacent 
to Vancouver, where he played hockey for the local minor team, the New 
Westminster Royals, and emerged as a star goaltender, playing for teams 
a year older than he was. He also played baseball in the New Westminster 
Minor Baseball Association and for the North Delta Blue Jays in the B.C. 
Premier Baseball League. Morneau attended Lord Tweedsmuir Elementary School 
in New Westminster, later transferring to Richard McBride Elementary School, 
where his mother was a teacher and coach and where he enrolled in a French 
immersion program. He played basketball and volleyball and ball hockey 
on the school teams. Growing up, Morneau was an avid sports fan, whose 
favourite athletes included hockey players Patrick Roy, fellow Vancouverite 
Cam Neely, Ray Bourque and baseball players John Olerud, Ken Griffey Jr, 
Jack Morris and Larry Walker. He was a Boston Bruins and Toronto Blue Jays 
fan. Morneau attended St. Thomas More Collegiate High School in 1994–95, 
for his grade 8 year, where he played basketball. Coaches approached him 
to play for the school's famed football program, based on his athletic 
ability, but he declined. Morneau transferred to New Westminster Secondary 
School and graduated in 1999. He continued to play basketball and hockey 
while in high school. He was named the New Westminster High School Athlete 
of the year and was a member of Canadian national champion baseball teams 
in 1997 and 1998. In 1998, he was selected the best hitter and catcher 
of the National Championships playing for Team British Columbia. Morneau 
was associated with the Portland Winter Hawks of the Western Hockey League; 
he attended training camp and played one preseason game of Major Junior 
hockey as a goaltender. Morneau chose his jersey number (33) for goalie 
Patrick Roy. He is listed as winning the Memorial Cup in 1998 with the 
Winter Hawks. As Morneau put it, "I was the third goalie. A backup to the 
backup. If somebody got hurt, I might have gotten out there as a backup. 
I played in an exhibition game and backed up some regular-season games.".[1] 
Morneau remained on Portland's Protected Player List until he decided to 
focus on baseball instead of hockey. According to Winter Hawks assistant 
coach at the time, Mike Williamson, "He was young and raw — a big guy who 
covered a lot of the net. I remember a conversation we had with him when 
recruiting him. We told him he should go to hockey because not many Canadian 
guys end up going very far and doing very well in baseball. He showed us 
otherwise."[2] Morneau did not attend college, despite receiving many attractive 
offers from NCAA schools. He was selected by the Twins in the 3rd round 
as the 89th overall pick of the 1999 MLB amateur entry draft. In six minor 
league seasons, he hit .310 with 87 home runs, 153 RBIs and 122 doubles. 
Morneau participated in the 2002 and 2004 All-Star Futures Games, playing 
for the World teams. Morneau played for the World team in MLB Futures Game, 
July 7 in Milwaukee. Morneau was twice named Eastern League Player of the 
Week, April 22–28 and July 15–21. On September 3, Morneau was promoted 
to Minnesota's Triple A team, The Edmonton Trappers. During his first Triple 
A season, Morneau won the PCL championship with the Trappers. Morneau made 
his Major League debut with the Twins on June 10, 2003 against the Colorado 
Rockies, batting clean-up. He singled in his first career at-bat off Jason 
Jennings and went 2 for 4 in the game. A week later, he hit his first career 
home run off Kansas City Royals reliever Albie Lopez. Morneau went on to 
hit four home runs in his rookie season while batting .226. He spent the 
majority of the season with the Twins' Triple-A affiliate Rochester Red 
Wings. In 2004, after compiling impressive minor league numbers, the Twins 
dealt veteran first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz to the Boston Red Sox and 
Morneau became the Twins' starting first baseman. He appeared in 74 games 
for the Twins in 2004, hitting 19 home runs and 58 RBIs in 280 at bats 
while committing just three errors. The 2005 season was a struggle for 
Morneau, as he dealt with a variety of off-season illnesses as well as 
being hit in the head by a pitch in April. Although he never appeared to 
fully shake off his early season setbacks, Morneau finished the 2005 season 
second on the Twins in home runs with 22 and paced the squad with 79 RBI. 
Prior to the 2006 season, Morneau suited up for his native Canada in the 
2006 World Baseball Classic. He hit .308 with 3 doubles and 2 RBIs in three 
games. After a slow start to 2006, Morneau exploded offensively in the 
months of June, July, and August, raising his batting average nearly 50 
points in June after beginning the month hitting .240. He raised his average 
another 33 points in July and after June consistently appeared near the 
top of the American League leaderboard in batting average, home runs, and 
RBI. On August 9, Morneau became the first Twin since 1987 to hit 30 home 
runs in a single season. He finished the season hitting .321 (6th in the 
AL) and slugging .559 (6th in AL) with 34 home runs and 130 RBI. He was 
second in the league in RBIs and tied Larry Walker's 1997 total for the 
most RBIs in a season by a Canadian. For his hitting, he won the 2006 American 
League Silver Slugger Award representing first basemen. On November 21, 
Morneau won the American League Most Valuable Player Award in a close vote 
over Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees, becoming only the fourth player 
in Twins history (after Zoilo Versalles, Harmon Killebrew, and Rod Carew) 
to receive the honour. He became the first Canadian to win the AL MVP award, 
and the second Canadian to win a major league MVP award (Larry Walker was 
the first, having won the NL MVP Award in 1997; Walker and Morneau were 
joined in 2010 by Joey Votto). Morneau played in 157 games, hitting 31 
home runs. In May 2007, Morneau won the Player of the Month in the American 
League for the first time in his career. Morneau appeared on the cover 
of the arcade baseball video game The Bigs in Canadian stores and at Best 
Buy stores in the United States. Morneau was named to the 2007 Major League 
Baseball All-Star Game roster in 2007 for the first time. He also participated 
in the 2007 State Farm Home Run Derby for the first time. He was up first 
and hit 4 homers and ended up tying with Albert Pujols in the first round. 
He was subsequently eliminated with only one homer on 5 chances in a tie-off. 
Pujols advanced to the 2nd round with 2 homers. Morneau had his first career 
three home run game on July 6, 2007, against the Chicago White Sox. He 
had a solo, a 2-run, and a 3-run homer. He had an at bat to try for his 
fourth home run, but his bat got under the ball, and he flew out to deep 
left field. In January 2008, Morneau agreed to a six-year contract worth 
$80 million, which at the time was the longest and richest contract in 
Minnesota Twins history until in 2010, teammate Joe Mauer signed an 8-year, 
$184 million contract.[3] Morneau produced with his new contract, as he 
played in all 163 of the Twins' games and hit .300 with 23 home runs and 
129 RBI.[4] On July 10, 2008, Morneau tied a career high with 5 hits in 
a game as the visiting Minnesota Twins defeated the Detroit Tigers. He 
hit what went on to be the game-winning home run to finish the day 5 for 
5 with a walk in a 7–6 extra-innings win.[5] Morneau was then announced 
as a reserve player for the American League in the 2008 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game.[6] Morneau won the 2008 Home Run Derby, defeating Josh Hamilton 
of the Texas Rangers. He became the first Canadian to win the Home Run 
Derby.[7] Later during the All-Star event, Morneau scored the winning run 
for the American League in the MLB All Star Game at Yankee Stadium on a 
sacrifice fly to right field off the bat of Michael Young.[8] Morneau was 
awarded the Lionel Conacher Award as the Canadian Press Male Athlete of 
the Year, joining Ferguson Jenkins and Larry Walker as the only Major League 
Baseball players to win the award.[9] Morneau finished second in the balloting 
for AL MVP, as Dustin Pedroia won, and Kevin Youkilis came in third.[10] 
Morneau hit 30 home runs and on July 5, 2009, was selected as a reserve 
position player at first base for the 2009 All Star Game. On September 
14, Morneau was officially diagnosed of having a stress fracture in his 
back after a long slump, and therefore missed the rest of the 2009 season 
and the playoffs.[11] Morneau got off to a strong start in the 2010 campaign, 
hitting a career first-half high .345 batting average and having a major-league 
leading .437 on-base percentage and .617 slugging percentage at the All-Star 
break. For the first time in his career, he was voted in by the fans to 
start the 2010 All-Star Game at first base, but ended up pulling out from 
the event after sustaining a concussion on July 7.[12] Morneau missed the 
remainder of the regular season with the effects of post-concussion syndrome. 
After the Twins clinched the American League Central Division championship, 
Morneau said that he was finally symptom-free. Morneau said he would be 
unavailable for the ALDS, but that he hoped to be available for the ALCS 
should the Twins advance.[13] On October 4, 2010, the Twins announced that 
Morneau would not return for the 2010 season, regardless of how far the 
team went in the postseason.[14] The Minnesota Twins were glad to see Morneau 
somewhat recovered from his season-ending concussion in July 2010. He was 
in the Opening Day starting line-up against the Toronto Blue Jays. This 
did not last long, though, as he missed five games with the flu later in 
April and a couple of games in June with a sore wrist. He underwent neck 
surgery in June to correct pinched nerves in his neck, causing him to miss 
two months from mid-June to mid-August. Just ten days later, he missed 
two games with a bruised foot. On August 29, 2011, Morneau suffered a left 
shoulder injury that would lead to mild concussion-like symptoms. These 
symptoms eventually led to Morneau missing the remainder of the season.[15] 
In 2011, Morneau appeared in just 69 games collecting just 60 hits, only 
four of them home runs. He batted a meager .227 with 19 walks and 30 RBI. 
All of the previous are career lows disregarding his rookie season.[16] 
In 2012, Morneau returned as an everyday first basemen for the Twins. Appearing 
in 134 games, Morneau finished the season with a .257 batting average, 
19 home runs and 77 RBI.[17] Before being traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates 
on August 31, Morneau played in 127 games for the Twins and had nearly 
matched his total stats for 2012, batting .259 with 17 home runs and 74 
RBI.[18] On August 31, 2013 he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in 
exchange for Alex Presley and a player to be named later,[19] who was later 
identified as Duke Welker on October 5, 2013.[20] On September 1, 2013 
he made his debut with the Pirates, playing first base and wearing number 
66. Morneau wore number 33 in Minnesota, but due to number being retired 
in Pittsburgh (in honour of Honus Wagner), he simply decided to double 
it.[21] On December 3, 2013, Morneau agreed to a 2-year, $14 million deal 
with the Colorado Rockies, pending a physical.[22] The deal became official 
on December 13.[23] Morneau won the 2014 batting title with a .319 batting 
average After the 2014 season, Morneau traveled to Japan to participate 
in the 2014 Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series.[24] On June 9, 
2016, Morneau signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the Chicago White 
Sox.[25] He was immediately placed on the 15-day disabled list, and was 
projected to return after the All-Star break.[26] Morneau's parents divorced 
when he was 7 years old. His mother is a retired teacher and his father 
works in a warehouse. He has an older brother named Geordie. His mother 
remarried in 2006 and now Justin has two stepsisters.[27] Morneau married 
Minnesota native Krista Martin in January 2009. Their daughter Evelyn was 
born on September 23, 2010;[28] their son Marty was born on July 21, 2012.[29][30] 
He has purchased a home in his hometown of New Westminster, where he plans 
to live after his career is over. His house is just four blocks from Queen's 
Park, where he grew up playing hockey and baseball. As a minor leaguer 
in Florida, he experienced homesickness, and would log onto a Vancouver 
radio station online to hear the weather and traffic reports, and wonder 
what his friends were up to back home.[27] Morneau's family is well known 
in New Westminster. On February 2, 2008, the city honoured him by renaming 
Moody Park Diamond #5 to Justin Morneau Field.[31] Morneau Field is located 
just 25 kilometres (16 mi) from a field named for one of Morneau's idols, 
Larry Walker Field, located in the nearby city of Maple Ridge. Morneau 
is extremely superstitious, and wears number 33 to honour his idol, former 
NHL goaltender Patrick Roy. As a young hockey player, he would refuse to 
leave the car for hockey games until the clock read  :33 minutes past the 
hour.[27] (He actually appears as an Easter egg in the NHL video game, 
NHL 2K8, playing his junior position of goaltender.) Morneau had a superstitious 
routine on game days in Minnesota. Before each home game, Morneau stopped 
by the same Jimmy John's Gourmet Subs, on Grand Avenue in St. Paul, Minnesota 
and ordered the same sandwich from the menu: Turkey Tom with no sprouts. 
Later, he drank a slurpee from a slurpee machine in the Twins' clubhouse 
made of one-half Mountain Dew, one-half red or orange flavor.[27] He currently 
resides in Plymouth, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. The Justin Morneau 
Foundation was established by Morneau himself and his wife, Krista, to 
support underprivileged communities with an emphasis on those where the 
Morneaus have lived. Over a span of four years, (2008–2011) Morneau has 
mailed more than 200 personalized holiday gifts to Twins employees, including
