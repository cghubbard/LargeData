Saint Louis Ballpark Village (BPV) is a dining and entertainment district 
adjacent to Busch Stadium where the St. Louis Cardinals play in downtown 
St. Louis, Missouri, occupying the site of the previous Busch Stadium.[1] 
Situated on the 200 and 300 blocks of Clark Street across from Busch Stadium, 
the $100 million first phase of Ballpark Village consists of 150,000 square 
feet (14,000 m2) of retail shops, restaurants, entertainment venues and 
720 parking spaces.[2] As BPV's name and locale suggest, it is designed 
to be an extension of Busch Stadium and an innovative approach to creating 
a neighborhood – hearkening to Chicago's own Wrigleyville district next 
to Wrigley Field – and vitalize downtown St. Louis' economic potential. 
The project offers over 200+ events annually instead of only the 81 days 
of Cardinals home games, make the region more of a focal point in the Midwest, 
and enhance the ballpark goers' experience. The first main phase of construction 
was completed in time for Opening Day of the 2014 Major League Baseball 
season. The Cardinals Hall of Fame and Museum and Cardinals Nation Restaurant, 
Fox Sports Midwest Live! Restaurant, the Budweiser Brew House, and PBR 
St. Louis all comprised the first phase. The primary developer is the Cordish 
Company of Baltimore, Maryland. On October 25, 2016, the Cardinals announced 
the second phase of Ballpark Village, scheduled to begin construction in 
late 2017 and be completed 18 months later, pending governmental and funding 
approval. The plan, a $250 million investment, includes a 29-story residential 
tower, a 10-story office building, and a two-story retail and entertainment 
building.[3] The Cardinals announced a groundbreaking date of February 
8, 2013, to start construction of the $100 million, 150,000 square-foot 
first-phase of the project. Ground was broken early on February 8. The 
Cardinals released new images of the $100 million first phase of the planned 
development Thursday the day before, showing a Budweiser Brew House and 
Live! at Ballpark Village entertainment area, Cardinals Nation, the Cardinals 
Hall of Fame and Museum and the 300-plus seating area with views into the 
ballpark. On February 14, the Cardinals announced plans to add the PBR 
Cowboy Bar to the entertainment area.[9][10] This part of the project moved 
along with little delay. On August 27, the final truss intended to hold 
the retractable roof was laid into place.[11] On September 18, chief operations 
officer Jim Watry announced plans for more than 1,000 jobs to be opened.[12] 
Before Opening Day, 2014, the rooftop seating similar to that found in 
Wrigleyville on top of the Cardinals Museum and Cardinal Nation Restaurant 
and Budweiser Brew House is on track to be completed.[13] The St. Louis 
Cardinals announced the addition of three more tenants to BPV on November 
14, 2013, including The Drunken Fish (a sushi restaurant), Howl at the 
Moon (a piano bar), and Ted Drewes Frozen Custard. These three new tenants 
were expected to be open in time for the completion of the first phase 
for the Cardinals' Opening Day, 2014. The grand opening was March 27, 2014, 
announcing its Phase 1 opening lineup.[14][15] It was considered a smashing 
success with the first phase of the project totaling 150,000 square feet.[16] 
Phase 2 of the development was announced on October 25, 2016. The Phase 
2 development still requires approval by the local government. It is slated 
to have high rise condominiums, retail, and office space.[17] Coordinates:
