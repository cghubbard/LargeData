Addison is a Chicago, Illinois station of the Chicago Transit Authority 
elevated train line popularly called the Chicago "L". It is located in 
the Wrigleyville area of the Lakeview neighborhood at 940 West Addison 
Street with city block coordinates at 3600 North at 940 West. Addison directly 
serves the Chicago Cubs and Wrigley Field, the city's north side Major 
League Baseball team and its stadium. The station is served by the Red 
Line. The station is within the shadow of the historic baseball stadium. 
Chicago artist Steve Musgrave has several murals featuring Cubs legends 
on display at the Addison station, which he adopted as part of the CTA's 
Adopt-A-Station program in 1998. Four large murals feature Cubs legends 
Billy Williams, Ferguson Jenkins, "Mr. Cub," Ernie Banks, and Ryne Sandberg.[3] 
A smaller painting of Harry Caray was added later. Since 1998, Musgrave 
has also designed posters commemorating the annual Cubsâ€“Sox crosstown series.[4] 
Beginning in 2003, the CTA has also issued farecards featuring the poster 
design.[5] Prior to 2007, southbound afternoon Purple Line Express trains 
stopped at the station before weekday evening Cubs games, to speed travel 
times for customers from Evanston, Skokie and Wilmette. In an effort to 
prevent delays due to Brown Line construction just south of the station, 
Purple Line Express trains now stop at the nearby Sheridan station instead.[6] 
Following Cubs games, this station can become overcrowded and jammed with 
people trying to get on the trains.[citation needed] Until 2016, AM Loop-bound 
Purple Line express trains shared 95th-bound Red Line tracks and stopped
