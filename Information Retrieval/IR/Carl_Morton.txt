Carl Morton (January 18, 1944 – April 12, 1983) was a starting pitcher 
in Major League Baseball who played for the Montreal Expos (1969–72) and 
Atlanta Braves (1973–76). He threw (and batted) right-handed. In an eight-season 
professional career, Morton posted an 87–92 record with 650 strikeouts 
and a 3.73 ERA in 1648.2 innings. Carl Wendle Morton, a native of Kansas 
City, Missouri, grew up in West Tulsa, where he played baseball on the 
same Webster High School team as future major-leaguer Rich Calmus.[citation

Morton started his pro career as an outfielder in the Atlanta Braves organization 
and later converted to a pitcher. He was selected by the Montreal Expos 
in the 1968 expansion draft. In 1970, Morton compiled an 18–11 record for 
the last-place Expos and was the National League Rookie of the Year, chosen 
over Bernie Carbo, Larry Bowa and César Cedeño. That same year he also 
received the Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award, becoming the first 
Montreal player to receive the honors. He also pitched 10 complete games, 
including four shutouts, and compiled a 3.60 ERA. But Morton was never 
able to recapture the same success for the rest of his stint in Montreal. 
Plagued by low run support, he went 10–18 in 1971 and slipped to 7–13 in 
1972. Then he was shipped back to the Braves before the 1973 season. In 
Atlanta, Morton strung together three consecutive 15+ win seasons for mediocre 
Braves teams,[citation needed] with a high 17 victories in 1975. A year 
later, he won only four games. Morton finished his career in the minors, 
pitching for the Rangers, Phillies and Pirates Triple-A teams until 1978. 
Morton died on April 12, 1983 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, of a heart attack after
