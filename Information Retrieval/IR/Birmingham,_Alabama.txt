Birmingham (/ˈbɜːrmɪŋhæm/ BUR-ming-ham) is the most populous city in the 
U.S. state of Alabama and the county seat of Jefferson County. The city's 
population was 212,237 in the 2010 United States Census.[3] The Birmingham-Hoover 
Metropolitan Statistical Area had a population of about 1,128,047 according 
to the 2010 Census, which is approximately one quarter of Alabama's population. 
Birmingham was founded in 1871, during the post-Civil War Reconstruction 
period, through the merger of three pre-existing farm towns, notably, former 
Elyton. It grew from there, annexing many more of its smaller neighbors, 
into an industrial and railroad transportation center with a focus on mining, 
the iron and steel industry, and railroading. Birmingham was named for 
Birmingham, England, one of the UK's major industrial cities. Most of the 
original settlers who founded Birmingham were of English ancestry.[4] In 
one writer's view, the city was planned as a place where cheap, non-unionized, 
and African-American labor from rural Alabama could be employed in the 
city's steel mills and blast furnaces, giving it a competitive advantage 
over industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast.[5] From its founding 
through the end of the 1960s, Birmingham was a primary industrial center 
of the southern United States. The pace of Birmingham's growth during the 
period from 1881 through 1920 earned its nicknames The Magic City and The 
Pittsburgh of the South. Much like Pittsburgh, Birmingham's major industries 
were iron and steel production, plus a major component of the railroading 
industry, where rails and railroad cars were both manufactured in Birmingham. 
In the field of railroading, the two primary hubs of railroading in the 
Deep South were nearby Atlanta and Birmingham, beginning in the 1860s and 
continuing through to the present day. The economy diversified during the 
later half of the twentieth century. Though the manufacturing industry 
maintains a strong presence in Birmingham, other businesses and industries 
such as banking, telecommunications, transportation, electrical power transmission, 
medical care, college education, and insurance have risen in stature. Mining 
in the Birmingham area is no longer a major industry with the exception 
of coal mining. Birmingham ranks as one of the most important business 
centers in the Southeastern United States and is also one of the largest 
banking centers in the United States. In addition, the Birmingham area 
serves as headquarters to one Fortune 500 company: Regions Financial, along 
with five other Fortune 1000 companies. In higher education, Birmingham 
has been the location of the University of Alabama School of Medicine (formerly 
the Medical College of Alabama) and the University of Alabama School of 
Dentistry since 1947. Since that time it has also obtained a campus of 
the University of Alabama, University of Alabama at Birmingham (founded 
circa 1969), one of three main campuses of the University of Alabama System. 
It is also home to three private institutions: Samford University, Birmingham-Southern 
College, and Miles College. Between these colleges and universities, the 
Birmingham area has major colleges of medicine, dentistry, optometry, physical 
therapy, pharmacy, law, engineering, and nursing. The city has three of 
the state's five law schools: Cumberland School of Law, Birmingham School 
of Law, and Miles Law School. Birmingham is also the headquarters of the 
Southwestern Athletic Conference, and Southeastern Conference, one of the 
major U.S. collegiate athletic conferences. Birmingham was founded on June 
1, 1871, by the Elyton Land Company whose investors included cotton planters, 
bankers and railroad entrepreneurs. It sold lots near the planned crossing 
of the Alabama & Chattanooga and South & North Alabama railroads including 
land formerly a part of the Benjamin P. Worthington plantation. The first 
business at that crossroads was the trading post and country store operated 
by Marre & Allen. The site of the railroad crossing was notable for the 
nearby deposits of iron ore, coal, and limestone – the three main raw materials 
used in making steel. Birmingham is the only place worldwide where significant 
amounts of all three minerals can be found in close proximity.[6] From 
the start the new city was planned as a great center of industry. The founders, 
organized as the Elyton Land Company, borrowed the name of Birmingham, 
one of England's main industrial cities, to advertise that point. The growth 
of the planned city was impeded by an outbreak of cholera and a Wall Street 
crash in 1873. However, it began to develop shortly afterward at an explosive 
rate. The town of Elyton, Alabama, and several other surrounding towns 
were absorbed into Birmingham in 1911. The start of the 20th century brought 
the substantial growth that gave Birmingham the nickname "The Magic City," 
as the downtown area developed from a low-rise commercial and residential 
district into a busy grid of neoclassical mid-rise and high-rise buildings 
and busy streetcar lines. Between 1902 and 1912 four large office buildings 
were constructed at the intersection of 20th Street, the central north–south 
spine of the city, and 1st Avenue North, which connected the warehouses 
and industrial facilities stretching along the east–west railroad corridor. 
This impressive group of early skyscrapers was nicknamed "The Heaviest 
Corner on Earth". Birmingham was hit by the 1916 Irondale earthquake (magnitude 
5.1). A few buildings in the area were slightly damaged. The earthquake 
was felt as far as Atlanta and neighboring states. While excluded from 
the best-paying industrial jobs, blacks joined the migration of residents 
from rural areas to the city for its opportunities. The Great Depression 
of the 1930s hit Birmingham especially hard as sources of capital that 
were fueling the city's growth rapidly dried up at the same time that farm 
laborers, driven off the land, made their way to the city in search of 
work. New Deal programs put many city residents to work in WPA and CCC 
programs, making important contributions to the city's infrastructure and 
artistic legacy, including such key improvements as Vulcan's tower and 
Oak Mountain State Park. The wartime demand for steel and the post-war 
building boom gave Birmingham a rapid return to prosperity. Manufacturing 
diversified beyond the production of raw materials. Major civic institutions 
such as schools, parks and museums, were able to expand their scope.[7] 
Despite the growing population and wealth of the city, its residents were 
markedly underrepresented in the state legislature. Although the state 
constitution required redistricting in accordance with changes in the decennial 
census, the state legislature did not undertake this until the early 1970s, 
when forced by the United States Supreme Court in its landmark decision 
in Reynolds v. Sims, a case brought by Birmingham-area voters, to enforce 
the principle of "one man, one vote." The Court found that the geographic 
basis of the state senate, which gave each county one senator, gave undue 
influence to rural counties. Representatives of rural counties also had 
disproportionate power in the state House of Representatives, and failed 
to provide support for infrastructure and other improvements in urban centers 
such as Birmingham. At this time, the General Assembly ran county governments 
as extensions of the state through their legislative delegations. In the 
1950s and 1960s Birmingham received national and international attention 
as a center of the civil rights struggle for African Americans. In the 
1950s independent KKK chapters had ready access to dynamite and other bomb 
materials, as many residents worked in mining and related industries. Whites 
unhappy with social changes committed racially motivated bombings of the 
houses of black families who moved into new neighborhoods in the 1950s, 
earning Birmingham the nickname "Bombingham". Locally the civil rights 
movement's activists were led by Fred Shuttlesworth, a fiery preacher who 
became legendary for his fearlessness in the face of such violence.[8] 
But he found city officials resistant to making changes for integration 
or lessening of Jim Crow. A watershed in the civil rights movement occurred 
in 1963 when Shuttlesworth requested that Martin Luther King, Jr., and 
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which Shuttlesworth 
had co-founded, come to Birmingham, to help end public segregation. King 
had served here as a pastor earlier in his career.[9] Together they launched 
"Project C" (for "Confrontation"), a massive assault through protests of 
the Jim Crow system. While imprisoned in April 1963 for having taken part 
in a nonviolent protest, Dr. King wrote the now famous "Letter from Birmingham 
Jail," a defining treatise in his cause against segregation. During April 
and May daily sit-ins and mass marches organized and led by movement leader 
James Bevel were met with police repression, tear gas, attack dogs, fire 
hoses, and arrests. More than 3,000 people were arrested during these protests, 
many of them children. On a Sunday in September 1963, a bomb went off at 
the 16th Street Baptist Church, killing four black girls. The activists' 
protests and national outrage about the police and KKK violence directed 
against the black community contributed to ultimate desegregation of public 
accommodations in Birmingham and also passage of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964.[10] In 1998 the Birmingham Pledge, written by local attorney James 
Rotch, was introduced at the Martin Luther King Unity Breakfast. As a grassroots 
community commitment to combating racism and prejudice, it has since been 
used for programs in all fifty states and in more than twenty countries.[11] 
In the 1970s urban-renewal efforts focused around the development of the 
University of Alabama at Birmingham, which developed into a major medical 
and research center. In 1971 Birmingham celebrated its centennial with 
a round of public-works improvements, including the upgrading of Vulcan 
Park and the construction of a major downtown convention center containing 
a 2,500-seat symphony hall, theater, 19,000-seat arena and exhibition halls. 
Birmingham's banking institutions enjoyed considerable growth as well and 
new skyscrapers started to appear in the city center for the first time 
since the 1920s. These projects helped the city's economy to diversify, 
but did not prevent the exodus of many of the city's residents to independent 
suburbs. In 1979 Birmingham elected Dr. Richard Arrington Jr. as its first 
African-American mayor. The population inside Birmingham's city limits 
has fallen over the past few decades, due in large part to "white flight" 
from the city to the surrounding suburbs. The city's formerly most populous 
ethnic group, non-Hispanic white,[12] has declined from 57.4 percent in 
1970 to 21.1 percent in 2010.[13] From 340,887 in 1960, the population 
had decreased to 242,820 in 2000, a loss of about 29 percent. By 2010, 
Birmingham's population was down to 212,237, its lowest since the mid-1920s. 
That same period saw a corresponding rise in the populations of the suburban 
communities of Hoover, Vestavia Hills, Alabaster, and Gardendale, none 
of which were incorporated as municipalities until after 1950. Today, Birmingham 
has begun to experience something of a rebirth. New resources have been 
dedicated in reconstructing the downtown area into a 24-hour mixed-use 
district. The market for downtown lofts and condominiums has increased 
while restaurant, retail and cultural options are also beginning to expand. 
In 2006, the visitors bureau selected "the diverse city" as a new tag line 
for the city.[14] In 2011, the Highland Park neighborhood of Birmingham 
was named as a 2011 America's Great Place by the American Planning Association.[15] 
In January 2015, the International World Game Executive Committee selected 
Birmingham as the host for the 2021 World Games.[16] Birmingham occupies 
Jones Valley, flanked by long parallel mountain ridges (the tailing ends 
of the Appalachian foothills – see Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians) running 
from north-east to south-west. The valley is drained by small creeks (Village 
Creek, Valley Creek) which flow into the Black Warrior River. The valley 
was bisected by the principal railroad corridor, along which most of the 
early manufacturing operations began. Red Mountain lies immediately south 
of downtown. Many of Birmingham's television and radio broadcast towers 
are lined up along this prominent ridge. The "Over the Mountain" area, 
including Shades Valley, Shades Mountain and beyond, was largely shielded 
from the industrial smoke and rough streets of the industrial city. This 
is the setting for Birmingham's more affluent suburbs of Mountain Brook, 
Vestavia Hills, Homewood, and Hoover. South of Shades Valley is the Cahaba 
River basin, one of the most diverse river ecosystems in the United States. 
Sand Mountain, a smaller ridge, flanks the city to the north and divides 
Jones Valley from much more rugged land to the north. The Louisville and 
Nashville Railroad (now CSX Transportation) enters the valley through Boyles 
Gap, a prominent gap in the long low ridge. Ruffner Mountain, located due 
east of the heart of the city, is home to Ruffner Mountain Nature Center, 
one of the largest urban nature reserves in the United States. According 
to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 151.9 square miles 
(393 km2), of which, 149.9 square miles (388 km2) is land and 2.0 square 
miles (5.2 km2) (1.34%) is water. Birmingham has an abundance of suburbs. 
Most of the metropolitan area lives outside of the city itself. In 2007, 
the metropolitan area was made up of 7 counties, 102 cities, and 21 school 
districts.[17] Since then Alabaster and Pelham have broken away from the 
Shelby County School System to form their own school systems. Some argue 
that the region suffers from having so many suburbs because companies can 
receive large incentives to move a short distance to another city, with 
no net gain in the area's economy.[18] Suburbs are listed in order of population. 
(2013) Birmingham has a humid subtropical climate, characterized by hot 
summers, mild winters, and abundant rainfall. January has a daily mean 
temperature of 43.8 °F (6.6 °C), and there is an average of 47 days annually 
with a low at or below freezing, and 1.4 where the high does not surpass 
freezing.[19] July has a daily mean temperature of 81.1 °F (27.3 °C); highs 
reach or exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on 55 days per year and 100 °F (38 °C) on 
2 or 3.[19] Precipitation is relatively well-distributed throughout the 
year, sometimes falling in the form of snow during winter; however, 10.3 
inches (26.2 cm) fell on March 13, 1993, during the 1993 Storm of the Century, 
which established the highest daily snowfall, one-storm, and winter season 
total on record. Normal snowfall for 1981–2010 is 1.6 in (4.1 cm), but, 
for the same period, median monthly snowfall for each month was zero.[19] 
The spring and fall months are pleasant but variable as cold fronts frequently 
bring strong to severe thunderstorms and occasional tornadoes to the region. 
The fall season (primarily October) features less rainfall and fewer storms, 
as well as lower humidity than the spring, but November and early December 
represent a secondary severe weather season. Birmingham is located on the 
heart of a Tornado Alley known as the Dixie Alley due to the high frequency 
of tornadoes in Central Alabama. The greater Birmingham area has been hit 
by two F5 tornadoes; one in Birmingham's northern suburbs in 1977, and 
second in the western suburbs in 1998. The area was hit by an EF4 tornado 
which was part of the 2011 Super Outbreak. In late summer and fall months, 
Birmingham experiences occasional tropical storms and hurricanes due to 
its proximity to the Central Gulf Coast. The record high temperature is 
107 °F (42 °C), set on July 29, 1930,[20] and the record low is −10 °F 
(−23 °C), set on February 13, 1899.[21] The Birmingham area is not prone 
to frequent earthquakes; its historical activity level is 59% less than 
the US average.[26] Earthquakes are generally minor and the Birmingham 
area can feel an earthquake from the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone. The 
magnitude 5.1 Irondale earthquake in 1916 caused damage in the Birmingham 
area and was felt in the neighboring states and as far as the Carolinas.[27] 
The 2003 Alabama earthquake centered in northeastern Alabama (magnitude 
4.6-4.9) was also felt in the rest of Alabama, as well as Georgia, Tennessee, 
Kentucky, North Carolina, and South Carolina. According to the 2010 U.S. 
Census:[12] Based on the 2000 census, there were 242,820 people, 98,782 
households, and 59,269 families residing in the city.[30] The population 
density was 1,619.7 people per square mile (625.4/km2). There were 111,927 
housing units at an average density of 746.6 per square mile (288.3/km2). 
The racial makeup of the city was 62.46% Black, 35.07% White, 0.17% Native 
American, 0.80% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.62% from other races, 
and 0.83% from two or more races. 1.55% of the population were Hispanic 
or Latino of any race. There were 98,782 households out of which 27.7% 
had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.1% were married couples 
living together, 24.6% had a female householder with no husband present, 
and 40.0% were non-families. 34.4% of all households were made up of individuals 
and 10.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. In 
the city, the population is spread out, with 25.0% under the age of 18, 
11.1% from 18 to 24, 30.0% from 25 to 44, 20.4% from 45 to 64, and 13.5% 
who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 
100 females there were 85.7 males. The median income for a household in 
the city was $31,898, and the median income for a family was $38,776. Males 
had a median income of $36,031 versus $30,367 for females. The city's per 
capita income was $19,962. About 22.5% of families and 27.3% of the population 
were below the poverty line, including 41.9% of those under the age of 
18 and 18.3% of those age 65 or over.[31] The Association of Statisticians 
of American Religious Bodies published data showing that in 2010, among 
metro areas with a greater than one million population, Birmingham had 
the second highest ratio of Christians, and the greatest ratio of Protestant 
adherents, in the United States.[32][33] The Southern Baptist Convention 
has 673 congregations and 336,000 members in the Birmingham Metro area. 
The United Methodists have 196 congregations and 66,759 members. The headquarters 
of the Presbyterian Church in America had been in Birmingham until the 
early 1980s; the PCA has more than 30 congregations and almost 15,000 members 
in the Birmingham-Hoover Metropolitan area with megachurches like Briarwood 
Presbyterian Church. The National Baptist Convention has 126 congregations 
and 69,800 members.[34] The city is home to the Roman Catholic Diocese 
of Birmingham, covering 39 counties and comprising 75 parishes and missions 
as well as seven Catholic high schools and nineteen elementary schools. 
There are also two Eastern Catholic parishes in the Birmingham area.[35] 
Additionally, the Catholic television network EWTN is headquartered in 
metropolitan Birmingham. There are three Eastern Orthodox Churches in the 
Metro Area as well, Greek, Russian and American. There is also a Unitarian 
Universalist church in the Birmingham area. The main campus of the Church 
of the Highlands is located in Birmingham. The church operates schools 
and churches across Alabama.[36] Birmingham was ranked 425th in crime rate 
in the U.S. for 2012 by CQ Press.[37] The Birmingham-Hoover Metropolitan 
Statistical Area was ranked as having the 35th highest crime rate in the 
U.S., out of 347 MSAs ranked in 2011 by CQ Press.[38] The Birmingham metro 
area crime rate is in line with other southern MSAs such as Jacksonville, 
FL, and Charlotte, NC.[39] U.S. News & World Report ranked Birmingham as 
the third most dangerous city in the nation for 2011 (only Atlanta and 
St. Louis were ranked higher).[40] There were 69 homicides in 2013, 62 
homicides in 2014, and 90 homicides for 2015 through December 15, 2015.[41][better source needed] 
The A&E Network series, "The First 48" has filmed episodes with some of 
the city's homicide detectives. From Birmingham's early days onward, the 
steel industry has always played a crucial role in the local economy. Though 
the steel industry no longer has the same prominence it once held in Birmingham, 
steel production and processing continue to play a key role in the economy. 
Steel products manufacturers American Cast Iron Pipe Company (ACIPCO) and 
McWane are based in the city. Several of the nation's largest steelmakers, 
including CMC Steel, U.S. Steel, and Nucor, also have a major presence 
in Birmingham. In recent years, local steel companies have announced about 
$100 million worth of investment in expansions and new plants in and around 
the city. Vulcan Materials Company, a major provider of crushed stone, 
sand, and gravel used in construction, is also based in Birmingham. In 
the 1970s and 1980s, Birmingham's economy was transformed by investments 
in bio-technology and medical research at the University of Alabama at 
Birmingham (UAB) and its adjacent hospital. The UAB Hospital is a Level 
I trauma center providing health care and breakthrough medical research. 
UAB is now the area's largest employer and the second largest in Alabama 
with a workforce of about 23,000 as of 2016.[42] Health care services providers 
HealthSouth, Surgical Care Affiliates and Diagnostic Health Corporation 
are also headquartered in the city. Caremark Rx was also founded in the 
city. Birmingham is also a leading banking center, serving as home to two 
major banks: Regions Financial Corporation and BBVA Compass. SouthTrust, 
another large bank headquartered in Birmingham, was acquired by Wachovia 
in 2004. The city still has major operations as one of the regional headquarters 
of Wachovia, which itself is now part of Wells Fargo Bank. In November 
2006, Regions Financial merged with AmSouth Bancorporation, which was also 
headquartered in Birmingham. They formed the 8th largest U.S. bank (by 
total assets). Nearly a dozen smaller banks are also headquartered in the 
Magic City, such as Superior Bank and Cadence Bank. As of 2009, the finance 
& banking sector in Birmingham employed 1,870 financial managers, 1,530 
loan officers, 680 securities commodities and financial services sales 
agents, 380 financial analysts, 310 financial examiners, 220 credit analysts, 
and 130 loan counselors.[43] While Birmingham has seen major change-ups 
with its banking industry, it was still the 9th largest banking hub in 
the United States by the amount of locally headquartered deposits in 2012.[44] 
A 2014 study found that the city moved down a spot to the 10th largest 
banking center.[45] The telephone company that is now owned by AT&T Inc., 
which was formerly BellSouth and before that South Central Bell, which 
had its headquarters in Birmingham, has a major nexus in Birmingham, supported 
by a skyscraper downtown as well as several large operational center buildings 
and a data center. The insurance companies Blue Cross and Blue Shield of 
Alabama, Protective Life, Infinity Property & Casualty, ProAssurance, and 
Liberty National have their headquarters in Birmingham, and these employ 
a large number of people in Greater Birmingham. Birmingham is also a powerhouse 
of construction and engineering companies, including BE&K, Brasfield & 
Gorrie, Robins & Morton, and B.L. Harbert International which routinely 
are included in the Engineering News-Record lists of top design and international 
construction firms.[46][47] Two of the largest soft-drink bottlers in the 
United States, each with more than $500 million in sales per year, are 
located in Birmingham. The Buffalo Rock Company, founded in 1901, was formerly 
a maker of just ginger ale, but now it is a major bottler for the Pepsi 
Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Bottling Company, United, founded in 1902, 
is the third-largest bottler of Coca-Cola products in the U.S. Birmingham 
has seen a noticeable decrease in the number of Fortune 500 companies headquartered 
in the city, due to mergers, moves, and buy-outs. In 2000, there were 10 
Fortune 500 companies headquartered in the city, while in 2014 there was 
only 1, Regions Bank. Birmingham also used to be home to more than 30 publicly 
traded companies, but in 2011 there were only 15.[48] This number has increased 
since then, but not significantly. Some companies, like Zoe's Kitchen were 
founded and operated in Birmingham, but moved their headquarters prior 
to going public,[49] even after saying they would stay in their home state.[50] 
Birmingham has been on a rebound, though, with the growth of companies 
like HealthSouth, Infinity Property and Casualty Corp., Southern Company, 
and others. The Birmingham metropolitan area has consistently been rated 
as one of America's best places to work and earn a living based on the 
area's competitive salary rates and relatively low living expenses. One 
study published in 2006 by Salary.com determined that Birmingham was second 
in the nation for building personal net worth, based on local salary rates, 
living expenses, and unemployment rates.[51] A 2006 study by web site bizjournals.com[52] 
calculated Birmingham's "combined personal income" (the sum of all money 
earned by all residents of an area in a year) at $48.1 billion.[53] Birmingham's 
sales tax, which also applies fully to groceries, stands at 10 percent 
and is the highest tax rate of the nation's 100 largest cities.[54][55] 
Although Jefferson County's bankruptcy filing was the largest government 
bankruptcy in U.S. history in 2011, Birmingham remains solvent.[56] In 
2014, Birmingham's largest public companies by market capitalization were 
Regions Bank (RF, $14.61 billion), Vulcan Materials (VMC, $8.45 billion), 
Energen (EGN, $6.47 billion), Protective Life (PL, $5.47 billion), and 
HealthSouth (HLS, $3.15 billion).[57] All were listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Since then, though, Energen has sold one of its largest subsidiaries, 
Alagasco, and Protective Life was bought by the Japanese company Dai-Ichi 
and removed from stock exchanges. If Alabama Power was considered independent 
of the Southern Company (headquartered in Atlanta), it would be the largest 
company with more than $5.9 billion in revenue in 2014.[58] In 2015, Birmingham's 
largest private companies by annual revenue and employees were O'Neal Industries 
($2.66 billion; 550 employees), EBSCO Industries ($2.5 billion; 1,220 employees), 
Drummond Co, Inc. ($2.4 billion; 1,380 employees), Brasfield & Gorrie, 
LLC ($2.2 billion; 973 employees), and McWane Inc. ($1.7 billion, 620 employees).[59] 
Birmingham is the cultural and entertainment capital of Alabama with numerous 
art galleries in the area including the Birmingham Museum of Art, the largest 
art museum in the Southeast. Downtown Birmingham is currently experiencing 
a cultural and economic rejuvenation, with several new independent shops 
and restaurants opening in the area. Birmingham is also home to the state's 
major ballet, opera, and symphony orchestra companies such the Alabama 
Ballet,[60] Alabama Symphony Orchestra, Birmingham Ballet, Birmingham Concert 
Chorale, and Opera Birmingham. ° The historic Lyric Theatre, which was 
completely renovated and reopened in 2016, hosts performing arts shows 
and concerts. Other entertainment venues in the area include: Birmingham's 
nightlife is primarily clustered around Five Points South and Lakeview. 
In addition, a $55-million "Uptown" entertainment district has recently 
opened adjacent to the BJCC featuring a number of restaurants and a Westin 
hotel. The Cultural Alliance of Greater Birmingham[64] maintains Birmingham365.org,[65] 
"a one-stop source for finding out what's going on where around" Birmingham. 
Birmingham is home to several museums. The largest is the Birmingham Museum 
of Art, which is also the largest municipal art museum in the Southeast. 
The area's history museums include Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, which 
houses a detailed and emotionally charged narrative exhibit putting Birmingham's 
history into the context of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement. It is located 
on Kelly Ingram Park adjacent to the 16th Street Baptist Church. Other 
history museums include the Southern Museum of Flight, Bessemer Hall of 
History[66] Sloss Furnaces National Historic Landmark, Alabama Museum of 
Health Sciences, and the Arlington Home. The Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame 
is housed in the historic Carver Theatre, and offers exhibits about the 
numerous notable jazz musicians from the state of Alabama. The McWane Science 
Center is a regional science museum with hands-on science exhibits, temporary 
exhibitions, and an IMAX dome theater. The center also houses a major collection 
of fossil specimens for use by researchers. Other unique museums include 
the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame; the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum, which 
contains the largest collection of motorcycles in the world; the Iron & 
Steel Museum of Alabama at Tannehill Ironworks Historical State Park, near 
McCalla; the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame; and the Talladega Superspeedway 
International Motorsports Hall of Fame museum. South of downtown, on Red 
Mountain, Vulcan Park features the world's largest cast iron statue, depicting 
Vulcan at his forge. It was cast for the 1904 St. Louis Exposition, and 
erected at Vulcan Park in 1938. Birmingham is home to numerous cultural 
festivals showcasing music, films, and regional heritage. Sidewalk Moving 
Picture Festival brings filmmakers from all over the world to Birmingham 
to have their films viewed and judged. This festival usually is scheduled 
in late August at eight venues around downtown. Screenings are concentrated 
at the Alabama Theatre. The Sloss Furnaces has an annual Halloween haunted 
attraction called "Sloss Fright Furnace". Another musical festival is the

jail." The song "Sweet Home Alabama" by Lynyrd Skynyrd contains the line 
"in Birmingham they love the governor". The song "Black Betty" by Ram Jam 
contains the line "She's from Birmingham (bam-ba-lam) Way down in Alabam' 
(bam-ba-lam)". Randy Newman wrote a song, titled "Birmingham", about a 
man living in this city. It was released as a track on his 1974 album Good 
Old Boys. Birmingham is mentioned in "Playboy Mommy" by American singer-songwriter 
Tori Amos and in "Run, baby, run" by American singer-songwriter Sheryl 
Crow. The Country band Blackhawk recorded the song "Postmarked Birmingham".[69] 
Tracy Lawrence and Ken Mellons each recorded the country song "Paint Me 
a Birmingham". The best known song of the husband and wife band Shovels 
And Rope is their original tune, "Birmingham". Birmingham has no major 
professional sport franchises. The Birmingham area is home to the Birmingham 
Barons, the AA minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, which plays 
at Regions Field in the Southside adjacent to Railroad Park. The University 
of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB Blazers) has a popular basketball program, 
and Samford University, located in Homewood, has basketball and football 
teams. The Hoover Metropolitan Stadium in the suburb of Hoover is home 
to the Southeastern Conference Baseball Tournament which drew more than 
108,000 spectators in 2006. There is also an amateur soccer association, 
known as La Liga. The Birmingham area also hosts the Alabama Alliance basketball 
teams. Birmingham was home to the Black Barons, a very successful Negro 
League baseball team. The Black Barons played home games at Rickwood Field, 
which is still standing in the Rising-West Princeton neighborhood, and 
is verified as being the oldest baseball field in America. The city has 
had several pro football franchises. The former pro football team in Birmingham, 
the Alabama Outlawz of the X-League Indoor Football folded in 2015. Other 
teams included the two-time champion WFL franchise, the Birmingham Americans/Birmingham 
Vulcans—before the league folded. A USFL franchise, the Birmingham Stallions–once 
again the league folded. A WLAF franchise, the Birmingham Fire–the WLAF 
was renamed NFL Europa and the franchise became the Rhein Fire before the 
league folded altogether in 2007. A CFL franchise, the Birmingham Barracudas—would 
play one season and then fold as the league ended its American franchise 
experiment. An XFL franchise, the Birmingham Thunderbolts–another instance 
where the league folded. Birmingham's Legion Field has hosted several college 
football postseason bowl games, including the Dixie Bowl (1948–49), the 
Hall of Fame Classic (1977–85), the All-American Bowl (1986–90), the SEC 
Championship Game (1992–93), the SWAC Championship Game (1999–2012), the 
Magic City Classic (1946–present) and, currently, the Birmingham Bowl (formerly 
the BBVA Compass Bowl, 2006–present). The Southeastern Conference, Southwestern 
Athletic Conference, and Gulf South Conference are also headquartered in 
Birmingham In 1996, Legion Field hosted early rounds of Olympic soccer 
where it drew record crowds. The field has also hosted men's and women's 
World Cup qualifiers and friendlies. A switch from natural grass to an 
artificial surface has left the stadium's role as a soccer venue in doubt. 
Motorsports are very popular in the Birmingham area and across the state, 
and the area is home to numerous annual motorsport races. the Aaron's 499 
& AMP Energy 500 are NASCAR Sprint Cup races that occur in April and October 
at the Talladega Superspeedway. The Indy Grand Prix of Alabama shares the 
Barber Motorsports Park road course with Superbike and sports car GrandAm 
races.[70] The PGA Champions Tour has had a regular stop in the Birmingham 
area since 1992, with the founding of the Bruno's Memorial Classic, later 
renamed the Regions Charity Classic. In 2011 the tournament will be replaced 
by The Tradition, one of the Champions Tour's five "major" tour events. 
Birmingham has been selected to host the World Games in 2021. It will be 
the first time that an American city has hosted the event since the inaugural 
World Games were held in Santa Clara, California in 1981.[71] Birmingham 
was also a home of professional ice hockey teams. The Birmingham Bulls 
were a professional ice hockey team based in Birmingham, Alabama, USA. 
They played in the World Hockey Association from 1976 to 1979 and the Central 
Hockey League from 1979 to 1981. The Bulls played their home games at the 
Birmingham Jefferson Convention Center. In 1992, another Birmingham hockey 
franchise was founded that used the Bulls name, the Birmingham Bulls of 
the East Coast Hockey League. This franchise was later sold to Atlantic 
City, New Jersey. Recreational fishing is popular in the Birmingham area. 
Recently,[when?] Birmingham was named "Bass Capital of the World" by ESPN 
and Bassmaster magazine. Over the last several years,[which?] Birmingham 
has been home to numerous major fishing tournaments, including the Bass 
Masters Classic. The U.S. Paralympic Training Facility is located in Birmingham 
and was a primary filming location for the 2005 documentary film Murderball, 
about wheelchair rugby players.[72] Birmingham has a strong-mayor variant 
mayor-council form of government, led by a mayor and a nine-member city 
council. The current system replaced the previous city commission government 
in 1962 (primarily as a way to remove Commissioner of Public Safety Eugene 
"Bull" Connor from power).[74] By Alabama law, an issue before a city council 
must be approved by a two-thirds majority vote (Act No. 452, Ala. Acts 
1955, as supplemented by Act No. 294, Ala. Acts 1965). Executive powers 
are held entirely by the Mayor's Office. Birmingham's current Mayor is 
William A. Bell. Mayor Bell, who previously served as interim Mayor in 
1999, won a special election on January 19, 2010, to fill the unexpired 
term of former Mayor Larry Langford. Langford was removed from office after 
being convicted of federal corruption charges on October 28, 2009.[75][76] 
In 1974 Birmingham established a structured network of neighborhood associations 
and community advisory committees to insure public participation in governmental 
issues that affect neighborhoods. Neighborhood associations are routinely 
consulted on matters related to zoning changes, liquor licenses, economic 
development, policing and other city services. Neighborhoods are also granted 
discretionary funds from the city's budget to use for capital improvements. 
Each neighborhood's officers meet with their peers to form Community Advisory 
Committees which are granted broader powers over city departments. The 
presidents of these committees, in turn, form the Citizen's Advisory Board, 
which meets regularly with the mayor, council, and department heads. Birmingham 
is divided into a total of 23 communities, and again into a total of 99 
individual neighborhoods with individual neighborhood associations.[77] 
The United States Postal Service operates post offices in Birmingham. The 
main post office is located at 351 24th Street North in Downtown Birmingham.[78] 
Birmingham is also the home of the Social Security Administration's Southeastern 
Program Service Center. This center is one of only seven in the United 
States that process Social Security entitlement claims and payments. In 
addition, Birmingham is the home of a branch bank of the Atlanta Federal 
Reserve Bank. The city is served by the Birmingham City Schools system. 
It is run by the Birmingham Board of Education with a current active enrollment 
of 30,500 in 62 schools: seven high schools, 13 middle schools, 33 elementary 
schools, and nine kindergarten-eighth-grade primary schools. The Birmingham 
Public Library administers 21 branches throughout the city and is part 
of a wider system including another 19 suburban branches in Jefferson County, 
serving the entire community to provide education and entertainment for 
all ages.[79] The greater-Birmingham metropolitan area is the home of numerous 
independent school systems, because there has a been a great deal of fragmentation 
of educational systems in Alabama, and especially in Jefferson County. 
Some of these "school systems" only have three to five schools. The metropolitan 
area's three largest school systems are the Jefferson County School System, 
Birmingham City Schools, and the Shelby County School System. However, 
there are many smaller school systems. The Birmingham area is reputed to 
be the home of some of Alabama's best high schools, colleges, and universities. 
In 2005, the Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School in Irondale, 
an eastern suburb of Birmingham, was rated as the No. 1 high school in 
America by Newsweek, a national publication. The school remains among the 
nation's top 5 high schools. Mountain Brook High School placed 250th on 
the list. Other local schools that have been rated among America's best 
in various publications include Homewood High School, Vestavia Hills High 
School and the Alabama School of Fine Arts located downtown. The metro 
area also has three highly regarded preparatory schools: Saint Rose Academy 
located in Birmingham proper The Altamont School, also located in Birmingham 
proper, and Indian Springs School in north Shelby County near Pelham. Noteworthy 
institutions of higher education in greater Birmingham include the University 
of Alabama at Birmingham, Samford University (includes the Cumberland School 
of Law), Birmingham School of Law, Miles College, the independent Miles 
Law School, Jefferson State Community College, Birmingham-Southern College, 
University of Montevallo (in Shelby County), Lawson State Community College, 
and Virginia College in Birmingham, the largest career college based in 
Birmingham. Birmingham is served by one major newspaper, The Birmingham 
News (circulation 150,346), which changed from daily to thrice-weekly publication 
on October 1, 2012. The Birmingham News' Wednesday edition features six 
sub regional sections named East, Hoover, North, Shelby, South, and West 
that cover news stories from those areas. The newspaper has been awarded 
two Pulitzer Prizes, in 1991 and 2007. The Birmingham Post-Herald, the 
city's second daily, published its last issue in 2006. Other local publications 
include The North Jefferson News, The Leeds News, The Trussville Tribune 
(Trussville, Clay and Pinson), The Western Star (Bessemer) and The Western 
Tribune (Bessemer). Weld for Birmingham, Birmingham Weekly and Birmingham 
Free Press[80] are Birmingham's free alternative publications. The Birmingham 
Times, a historic African-American newspaper, also is published weekly. 
Birmingham is served by the city magazine of the Chamber of Commerce, Birmingham 
magazine. Birmingham is part of the Birmingham/Anniston/Tuscaloosa television 
market. The major television affiliates, most of which have their transmitters 
and studios located on Red Mountain in Birmingham, are WBRC 6 (Fox), WBIQ 
10 (PBS), WVTM 13 (NBC), WTTO 21 (CW), WIAT 42 (CBS), WPXH 44 (ION), WBMA-LD 
58/68.2 (ABC) and WABM 68 (MyNetworkTV). NOAA Weather Radio station KIH54 
broadcasts Weather and Hazard information for the Birmingham Metropolitan 
Area. Major broadcasting companies who own stations in the Birmingham market 
include IHeartMedia, Cox Radio, Cumulus Media, and Crawford Broadcasting. 
The Rick and Bubba show, which is syndicated to over 25 stations primarily 
in the Southeast, originates from Birmingham's WZZK-FM. The Paul Finebaum 
sports-talk show, also syndicated and carried nationwide on Sirius digital 
radio, originated from WJOX. Birmingham is home to EWTN (Eternal Word Television 
Network), the world's largest Catholic media outlet and largest religious 
network of any kind broadcasting to about 150 million homes worldwide, 
as of 2009.[81] Before the first structure was built in Birmingham, the 
plan of the city was laid out over a total of 1,160 acres (4.7 km2) by 
the directors of the Elyton Land Co. The streets were numbered from west 
to east, leaving Twentieth Street to form the central spine of downtown, 
anchored on the north by Capital Park and stretching into the slopes of 
Red Mountain to the south. A "railroad reservation" was granted through 
the center of the city, running east to west and zoned solely for industrial 
uses. As the city grew, bridges and underpasses separated the streets from 
the railroad bed, lending this central reservation some of the impact of 
a river (without the pleasant associations of a waterfront). From the start, 
Birmingham's streets and avenues were unusually wide at 80 to 100 feet 
(24 to 30 m), purportedly to help evacuate unhealthy smoke. In the early 
20th century professional planners helped lay out many of the new industrial 
settlements and company towns in the Birmingham District, including Corey 
(now Fairfield) which was developed for the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad 
Company (subsequently purchased by U.S. Steel). At the same time, a movement 
to consolidate several neighboring cities gained momentum. Although local 
referendums indicated mixed feelings about annexation, the Alabama legislature 
enacted an expansion of Birmingham's corporate limits that became effective 
on January 1, 1910. The Robert Jemison company developed many residential 
neighborhoods to the south and west of Birmingham which are still renowned 
for their aesthetic quality. A 1924 plan for a system of parks, commissioned 
from the Olmsted Brothers is seeing renewed interest with several significant 
new parks and greenways under development. Birmingham officials have approved 
a City Center Master Plan developed by Urban Design Associates of Pittsburgh, 
which advocates strongly for more residential development in the downtown 
area. The plan also called for a major park over several blocks of the 
central railroad reservation: Railroad Park, which opened in 2010. Along 
with Ruffner Mountain Park and Red Mountain Park, Birmingham ranks first 
in the United States for public green space per resident. The city is served 
by four Interstate Highways: Interstate 20, Interstate 65, Interstate 59, 
and Interstate 22, as well as a southern bypass expressway Interstate 459, 
which connects with I-20/59 to the southwest, with I-65 the south, I-20 
to the east, and I-59 to the northeast. Beginning in downtown Birmingham 
is the "Elton B. Stephens Expressway"—the Red Mountain Expressway to the 
southeast—which carries both U.S. Highway 31 and U.S. Highway 280 to, through, 
and over Red Mountain. Interstate 22 is on the verge of completion between 
Birmingham and Memphis, Tennessee, lacking only the final three to four 
miles that will connect it with I-65 just north of the Birmingham city 
limits. Construction has begun on the first segment of I-422, a Northern 
Beltline Highway that will serve the suburbs on the opposite side of Birmingham 
from I-459. In the area of metropolitan public transportation, Birmingham 
is served by the Birmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority (BJCTA) 
bus, trolley, and paratransit system, which from 1985 until 2008 was branded 
the Metro Area Express (MAX). BJCTA also operates a "downtown circulator" 
service named "D A R T" for Downtown Area Runabout Transit, which consists 
of two routes in the central business district and one in the UAB area, 
and also operates hourly Airport Shuttle routes directly from downtown 
and UAB area hotels to the airport.[82] Bus service to other cites is provided 
by Greyhound Lines.[83] Megabus also offers bus service to Atlanta and 
Memphis.[84] The Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport serves 
more than 3 million passengers every year. With more than 160 flights daily, 
the airport offers flights to 37 cities provided by United Express, Delta 
Air Lines/Delta Connection, American Eagle, and Southwest Airlines. Birmingham 
is served by three major railroad freight line the Norfolk Southern Company, 
CSX Transportation, and the BNSF Railway. Together with smaller regional 
railroads, the Alabama Warrior Railway and the Birmingham Southern Railroad. 
Amtrak's Crescent operates one passenger train each direction daily. The 
water for Birmingham and the intermediate urbanized area is served by the 
Birmingham Water Works Board (BWWB). A public authority that was established 
in 1951, the BWWB serves all of Jefferson, northern Shelby, western St. 
Clair counties. The largest reservoir for BWWB is Lake Purdy, which is 
located on the Jefferson and Shelby County line, but has several other 
reservoirs including Bayview Lake in western Jefferson County. There are 
plans to pipeline water from Inland Lake in Blount County and Lake Logan 
Martin, but those plans are on hold indefinitely. Jefferson County Environmental 
Services serves the Birmingham metro area with sanitary sewer service. 
Sewer rates have increased in recent years[85] after citizens concerned 
with pollution in area waterways filed a lawsuit that resulted in a federal 
consent decree to repair an aging sewer system. Because the estimated cost 
of the consent decree was approximately three times more than the original 
estimate, many blame the increased rates on corruption of several Jefferson 
County officials.[85] The sewer construction and bond-swap agreements continue 
to be a controversial topic in the area.[85] Electric power is provided 
primarily by Southern Company-subsidiary, Alabama Power. However, some 
of the surrounding area such as Bessemer and Cullman are provided by TVA. 
Bessemer also operates its own water and sewer system.[86] Natural gas 
is provided by Alagasco, although some metro area cities operate their 
own natural gas services. The local telecommunications are provided by 
AT&T. Cable television service is provided by Bright House Networks within 
the cities of Birmingham and Irondale, and Charter Communications in the 
rest of metro area. Birmingham's Sister Cities program is overseen by the 
Birmingham Sister Cities Commission.[87] Coordinates: 33°31′30″N 86°48′47″W﻿
