As player As manager Gordon Stanley "Mickey" Cochrane (April 6, 1903 â€“ 
June 28, 1962), nicknamed "Black Mike", was an American professional baseball 
player, manager and coach.[1] He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher 
for the Philadelphia Athletics and Detroit Tigers. Cochrane was considered 
one of the best catchers in baseball history and is a member of the Baseball 
Hall of Fame.[2][3][4] Cochrane was born in Massachusetts and was a multi-sport 
athlete at Boston University. After college, he chose baseball over basketball 
and football. He made his major league debut in 1925, having spent only 
one season in the minor leagues. He was chosen as the American League (AL) 
Most Valuable Player in 1928 and he appeared in the World Series from 1929 
to 1931. Philadelphia won the first two of those World Series, but Cochrane 
was criticized for giving up stolen bases when his team lost the series 
in 1931. Cochrane's career batting average (.320) stood as a record for 
MLB catchers until 2009. Cochrane's career ended abruptly after a near-fatal 
head injury from a pitched ball in 1937. After his professional baseball 
career, he served in the United States Navy in World War II and ran an 
automobile business. Cochrane died of cancer in 1962. In 1999, The Sporting 
News ranked him 65th on its list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. 
Cochrane was born in Bridgewater, Massachusetts to Northern Irish immigrant 
John Cochrane, whose father had immigrated to Ulster from Scotland and 
Scottish immigrant Sadie Campbell.[2] He was also known as "Black Mike" 
because of his fiery, competitive nature.[2][3] Cochrane was educated at 
Boston University, where he played five sports, excelling at football and 
basketball.[5] Although he considered himself a better football player 
than a baseball player, professional football was not as established as 
Major League Baseball at the time, so he signed with the Portland Beavers 
of the Pacific Coast League in 1924.[6] After just one season in the minor 
leagues, Cochrane was promoted to the major leagues, making his debut with 
the Philadelphia Athletics on April 14, 1925 at the age of 22.[1] He made 
an immediate impact by becoming Connie Mack's starting catcher in place 
of Cy Perkins, who was considered one of the best catchers in the major 
leagues at the time.[7] A left-handed batter, he ran well enough that manager 
Mack would occasionally have him bat leadoff. He hit third more often, 
but whatever his place in the order his primary role was to get on base 
so that hard-hitting Al Simmons and Jimmie Foxx could drive him in. In 
May, he tied a twentieth-century major league record by hitting three home 
runs in a game.[8] He ended his rookie season with a .331 batting average 
and a .397 on-base percentage, helping the Athletics to a second-place 
finish. By the start of the 1926 season, Cochrane was already considered 
the best catcher in the major leagues.[9] He won the 1928 American League 
Most Valuable Player Award, mostly for his leadership and defensive skills, 
when he led the American League in putouts and hit .293 along with 10 home 
runs and 58 runs batted in.[2][10] He was a catalyst in the Athletics' 
pennant-winning years of 1929, 1930 and 1931 when he hit .331, .357 and 
.349 respectively.[1][5] He played in those three World Series, winning 
the first two, but was sometimes blamed for the loss of the 1931 World 
Series, when the St. Louis Cardinals, led by Pepper Martin, stole eight 
bases and the Series. However, in his book The Life of a Baseball Hall 
of Fame Catcher, author Charlie Bevis cites the Philadelphia pitching staff's 
carelessness in holding runners as a contributing factor.[11][12] But notwithstanding 
this, the blame for the 1931 World Series loss dogged Cochrane for the 
rest of his life.[11] In 1934, Connie Mack started to disassemble his dynasty 
for financial reasons and put Cochrane on the trading block. He found a 
willing recipient in the Detroit Tigers. Their owner, Frank Navin, was 
also suffering from financial troubles. They hadn't finished higher than 
third since 1933, and had developed a reputation for being content with 
mediocrity. Attendance at Navin Field had sagged for some time. Navin had 
originally hoped to acquire Babe Ruth and make him player-manager, but 
after those talks fizzled, he turned to the A's.[13] A deal to send Cochrane 
to Detroit was quickly arranged, and Navin immediately named him player-manager.[5] 
It was as a Tiger that he cemented his reputation as a team leader. His 
competitive nature drove the Tigers, who had been picked to finish in fourth 
or fifth place, to the 1934 American League championship, their first pennant 
in 25 years.[5][14][15] Cochrane routinely platooned Gee Walker, a right-handed 
batter, to spell left fielder Goose Goslin and center fielder Jo-Jo White, 
who were both left-handed batters.[16] Cochrane's leadership and strategic 
skills won him the 1934 Most Valuable Player Award, remarkable considering 
that Lou Gehrig had won the Triple Crown.[5][17] He followed this by leading 
the Tigers to another American League pennant in 1935 and earning a victory 
over the Chicago Cubs in the 1935 World Series.[18] In late 1935, the Detroit 
Free Press speculated that Cochrane might eventually succeed Navin as team 
president.[19] Due in part to his high-strung nature, however, he suffered 
a nervous breakdown during the 1936 season.[5] On May 25, 1937; Cochrane 
was hit in the head by a pitch by Yankees pitcher Bump Hadley. Hospitalized 
for seven days, the injury nearly killed him. His accident generated a 
call for protective helmets for batters, but tradition won out at that 
time.[20] He was forced to retire at the age of 34 after doctors ordered 
him not to attempt to play baseball again.[15] Cochrane compiled a .320 
batting average while hitting 119 home runs over a 13-year playing career.[1] 
His .320 batting average was the highest career mark for catchers until 
Joe Mauer surpassed it in 2009.[21] His .419 on-base percentage is among 
the best in baseball history, and is the highest all-time among catchers.[2][22] 
In 1932, he became the first major league catcher to score 100 runs and 
produce 100 RBI in the same season.[23] He hit for the cycle twice in his 
career, on July 22, 1932 and August 2, 1933.[24][25] In his first 11 years, 
he never caught fewer than 110 games.[2] He led American League catchers 
six times in putouts and twice each in double plays assists and fielding 
percentage.[25][26] Cochrane returned to the dugout to continue managing 
the Tigers, but had lost his competitive fire.[15] He managed for the remainder 
of the 1937 season, but was replaced midway through the 1938 season.[5] 
His all-time managerial record was 348-250, for a .582 winning percentage.[27] 
Despite his head injury, Cochrane served in the United States Navy during 
World War II[3][5] as did Bill Dickey of the Yankees, giving the Navy the 
two greatest catchers baseball had yet seen; with Yogi Berra also serving 
but not yet having reached the major leagues, there were actually three 
possible "greatest catchers ever" in the World War II-era Navy. In 1947, 
Cochrane became the third catcher enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame 
after Roger Bresnahan and Buck Ewing.[4][28] Long after the Athletics left 
Philadelphia for Kansas City in 1954 without retiring his uniform number 
2, the Philadelphia Phillies honored him by electing him to the Philadelphia 
Baseball Wall of Fame at Veterans Stadium,[29] although the Athletics' 
plaques from that display have been moved to the Philadelphia Athletics 
Museum in Hatboro, Pennsylvania. The Tigers honored him by renaming National 
Avenue (behind the third-base stands of the old Tiger Stadium) Cochrane 
Avenue, but have never retired the uniform number 3 he wore with them. 
Cochrane owned an automobile business after his baseball days; he sold 
it in the mid-1950s.[30] A heavy smoker, Cochrane was only 59 when he died 
in 1962 in Lake Forest, Illinois of lymphatic cancer.[3] In his book, The 
Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, baseball historian Bill James 
ranked Cochrane 4th all-time among major league catchers.[31] In 1999, 
he was ranked 65th on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball 
Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[32][33]
