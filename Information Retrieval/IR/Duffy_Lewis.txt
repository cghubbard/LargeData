George Edward "Duffy" Lewis (April 18, 1888 – June 17, 1979), born in San 
Francisco, California, was a left fielder and right-handed batter who played 
Major League Baseball for the Boston Red Sox (1910–17), New York Yankees 
(1919–20) and Washington Senators (1921). Lewis attended Saint Mary's College 
of California. In Boston, Lewis belonged to the outfield trio which included 
Tris Speaker (CF) and Harry Hooper (RF) and is considered perhaps the best 
ever in fielding skill. At bat, Lewis was a renowned line-drive hitter 
who consistently finished in the top ten in most offensive categories despite 
a short career which was interrupted by World War I (Duffy served as a 
petty officer in the US Navy).[1] In 11 seasons, Lewis batted .284 with 
38 home runs, 793 RBI, 612 runs, 1518 hits, 289 doubles, 68 triples, and 
113 stolen bases in 1459 games. During his tenure in Boston patrolling 
left field, Fenway Park featured a ten-foot-high mound that formed an incline 
in front of the left field wall, now better known as the Green Monster. 
The young outfielder mastered the incline to such an extent that it was 
nicknamed "Duffy's Cliff".[2] Sports cartoons of the period often depicted 
him as a mountain climber making catches amid sheep and snowcaps. The mound 
was eventually reduced in 1934, long after Lewis had left the Sox, and 
was not completely eliminated until the field underwent a major renovation 
following the 2004 season. Duffy Lewis died in Salem, New Hampshire at 
91 years of age. He was selected to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in
