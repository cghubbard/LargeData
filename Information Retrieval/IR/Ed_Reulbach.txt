Edward Marvin "Big Ed" Reulbach (December 1, 1882 â€“ July 17, 1961) was 
a major league baseball pitcher for the Chicago Cubs during their glory 
years of the early 1900s. In the 1906 World Series (ultimately won in six 
games by the Chicago White Sox), Reulbach shone in Game 2 at South Side 
Park, giving up only one hit, a seventh-inning single to George Rohe. This 
rare World Series low-hit game (there have only been 5 in the 100-plus 
years of the Series) was matched by fellow Cubs star Claude Passeau in 
1945 when he threw just the second one-hitter in Series history, only to 
be surpassed by Don Larsen's perfect game in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series. 
His best year was 1908, when he won 24 games for the National League and 
World Series champion Cubs, their last Series championship to date. He 
pitched two shutouts in one day against the Brooklyn Dodgers on September 
26, 1908. No other pitcher has ever accomplished this feat in the major 
leagues. In a 1976 Esquire magazine article, sportswriter Harry Stein published 
an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter", consisting of five ethnic baseball 
teams. Reulbach was the right-handed pitcher on Stein's Jewish team, though 
Reulbach was, in fact, Roman Catholic and is buried in Montclair, New Jersey's 
Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Cemetery. He died in 1961 and was 
buried in Immaculate Conception Cemetery, Montclair.[1] Reulbach was the 
last surviving Chicago Cub to have played in the 1908 World Series, their 
most recent world championship until 2016. Reulbach played college baseball
