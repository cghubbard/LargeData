Aaron James Judge (born April 26, 1992) is an American professional baseball 
outfielder for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). Judge 
was the 32nd pick of the first year player draft in 2013. He is a member 
of the New York Yankees' organization and is largely regarded as one of 
their top prospects. Before his professional career, Judge played college 
baseball for the Fresno State Bulldogs of California State University, 
Fresno. Judge attended Linden High School, where he was a three-sport star. 
He was recruited by colleges to play American football, but he preferred 
baseball. He was selected by the Oakland Athletics in the 31st round of 
the 2010 Major League Baseball draft, but opted to attend college. He enrolled 
at California State University, Fresno (Fresno State), where he played 
college baseball for the Fresno State Bulldogs baseball team in the Mountain 
West Conference. Louisville Slugger named him a Freshman All-American. 
He was the winner of the 2012 TD Ameritrade College Home Run Derby.[1] 
In his junior year, Judge led the Bulldogs in home runs, doubles, and runs 
batted in (RBIs).[2] Judge was named All-Mountain West Conference in all 
three seasons he played for the Bulldogs.[2] The Yankees drafted Judge 
in the first round, with the 32nd overall selection, of the 2013 Major 
League Baseball draft.[3][4] Judge signed with the Yankees, receiving a 
$1.8 million signing bonus.[5] He tore a quadriceps femoris muscle while 
participating in a base running drill, which kept him out of the 2013 season. 
He made his professional debut with the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class 
A South Atlantic League in 2014.[1] He had a .333 batting average, .428 
on-base percentage (OBP), .530 slugging percentage (SLG), and hit nine 
home runs with 45 RBIs in 65 games for Charleston. The Yankees promoted 
him to the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League during 
the season, where he hit .283 with a .411 OBP, .442 SLG, eight home runs, 
and 33 RBIs in 66 games.[2] The Yankees invited Judge to spring training 
as a non-roster player in 2015.[6] Judge began the 2015 season with the 
Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League.[7] After Judge batted .284 
with a .350 OBP and 12 home runs in 63 games for Trenton, the Yankees promoted 
Judge to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Class AAA International 
League in June.[8] He was chosen to represent the Yankees at the 2015 All-Star 
Futures Game.[9] The Yankees decided not to include Judge in their September 
call-ups.[10] Judge batted .224 with eight home runs in 61 games for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.[11] 
The Yankees invited Judge to spring training in 2016, and he began the 
season with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. He had a .270 batting average, 19 home 
runs, and 65 RBIs in 93 games for the RailRiders.[12] Judge made his MLB 
debut on August 13, 2016, starting in right field against the Tampa Bay 
Rays.[13] In his first at bat, he hit his first major league home run off 
Matt Andriese; the previous batter, Tyler Austin, also making his debut, 
did the same. This marked the first time that two teammates had hit home 
runs in their first career at bats in the same game.[14] Judge also hit 
a home run in his second MLB game.[15] Judge's debut season, in which he 
struck out 42 times in 84 at-bats, ended prematurely with a grade 2 right 
oblique strain on September 13, 2016.[16] Judge is listed at 6 feet 7 inches 
(2.01 m) and 275 pounds (125 kg). Due to his large size and strength, he 
has elicited comparisons to Giancarlo Stanton, Dave Winfield, and Willie 
Stargell.[17][2] Judge was adopted by Patty and Wayne Judge, who both worked 
as teachers, the day after he was born. He has an older brother, John,
