Brayan Eduardo Peña (born January 7, 1982) is a Cuban-American professional 
baseball who is a catcher and first baseman on the roster for the St. Louis 
Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played in MLB for 
the Atlanta Braves, Kansas City Royals, Detroit Tigers and Cincinnati Reds. 
Peña was born and raised in Havana, Cuba and was a member of the Cuban 
National 18-and-under team. He graduated from Espa Julio Trigo. He grew 
up with former teammate and current Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Infielder, 
Yunel Escobar. Peña left Cuba for the United States in 1999.[1] Peña was 
called up to the big leagues early in the 2005 season because of an injury 
to Eddie Pérez. He made his debut on May 23, 2005 in an 8-6 home win over 
the New York Mets. Starting at catcher and batting seventh, Peña went 1-4 
and scored a run. His first hit was a second-inning single off Kazuhisa 
Ishii.[2] At the big-league level for the year, in 18 games he batted .179 
with four runs batted in.[3] For the next three seasons, 2006-2008, he 
saw part-time action for the Braves, playing in 23, 16 and 14 games, respectively, 
and totaling 22 hits including two home runs. On May 28, 2006, he hit his 
first Major League home run, a seventh-inning solo shot off Roberto Novoa 
in a 13-12 Braves win.[4] On May 23, 2008, the Braves designated Peña for 
assignment. On May 30, 2008, Peña was claimed off waivers by the Kansas 
City Royals. However, he was designated for assignment the next day, and 
did not appear in a game. He was promoted from the Royals' AAA affiliate 
on May 31, 2009. He then saw his most big-league playing time to date, 
appearing in 64 games and batting .273 with six home runs and 18 RBIs.[3] 
In 2010, he earned a spot in the big-league roster during spring training 
and spent the 2010 season backing up Jason Kendall. He looked to earn a 
spot as a starter for the future in the last month of the season, as Kendall 
was out due to injury. Peña received the bulk of the playing time behind 
the plate in September. For the season, he played in 60 games and batted 
.253 with one homer and 19 RBIs.[3] In 2011, Peña shared starting catching 
duty with Matt Treanor. By the end of the season, he served as the backup 
to Salvador Pérez. He played in a then career-high 72 games, batting .248 
with three homers and 24 RBIs.[3] On January 16, 2012, Peña signed a one-year 
deal for $875,000 with the Royals, avoiding arbitration in the process.[5] 
On the season, he batted .236 with two homers and 25 RBIs. On November 
20, 2012 the Royals designated Peña for assignment as they made room on 
the 40-man roster ahead of the Rule 5 draft.[6] On December 10, 2012, Peña 
signed a one-year contract with the Detroit Tigers and was the backup for 
Alex Avila during the 2013 season.[7] He played in 71 games in 2013, and 
posted the best batting average of his career at .297 to go with four home 
runs and 22 RBIs. Peña and the Cincinnati Reds agreed to terms on a two-year 
contract, covering the 2014 and 2015 seasons. In 2014 Peña shared playing 
time with catcher Devin Mesoraco and played first base while first baseman 
Joey Votto was injured.[8] By the 2014 all-star break, Peña was on his 
way to a career year, playing in 65 games and batting .250 with three home 
runs, 17 RBIs and an already career-best 12 doubles.[3] On November 2, 
2015, Peña became a free agent. On November 30, 2015, Peña agreed to a 
two-year, $5 million contract with the St. Louis Cardinals to be the primary 
backup to Yadier Molina.[9] In mid-December 2015, Peña accompanied an expedition 
to Cuba composed of former Cardinals including Joe Torre and Jon Jay, and 
other MLB officials and players. It was MLB's first visit there since 1999, 
and one anticipated as an important step to help normalize relations with 
the United States that had begun to ease earlier in the year.[10][11] He 
began the season on the DL after surgery to remove loose cartilage in his 
left knee, which he attributed to slipping on the dugout steps in spring 
training.[12] On July 5, 2016, Peña announced that he was planning to join 
the Army Reserve after the 2016 season. Later that day though, he was informed 
that he was unable to enlist because such an action would violate the terms 
of his contract. Peña chose to become an ambassador for the troops instead.[13]
