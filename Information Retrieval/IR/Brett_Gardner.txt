Brett Michael Gardner (born August 24, 1983) is an American professional 
baseball outfielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees. 
He made his MLB debut with the Yankees in 2008. He was named an All-Star 
in 2015 and won a Gold Glove Award in 2016. Gardner is currently the longest-tenured 
New York Yankee. In 2003, Gardner attended walk-on tryouts for the baseball 
team at the College of Charleston. After the tryouts, Coach John Pawlowski 
told the players that he would contact them if they made the team. Without 
hearing a word from the coach, Gardner came to the field the next day for 
the first official practice, wearing his high school uniform.[citation

that he knew he was capable of playing at the Division I level. Pawlowski 
told Gardner that he could practice with the team, but if at any time if 
Pawlowski saw that Gardner wasn't capable then he would be let go.[1] Gardner 
was a three-year starter for the College of Charleston Cougars. In 2004, 
he was chosen to the All-Southern Conference Team. His .447 batting average 
was third in the nation in 2005, and his 122 hits tied for most in the 
country. In 2005, he set a new College of Charleston record of 85 runs 
for the season, and also had 38 stolen bases. He was named third-team All-American 
and All-Southern Conference. He had a .382 batting average, .456 on-base 
percentage, and .508 slugging percentage with the Cougars, mostly from 
the lead-off spot.[2] After his junior year in college, the New York Yankees 
selected Gardner in the third round of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft. 
Gardner received a $210,000 signing bonus. Gardner finished the 2005 season 
in the New York–Penn League season ranking 5th in at bats (with 282), 2nd 
in runs (62), and 5th in stolen bases (19). He was a Florida State League 
all star in 2006, batting .323 in 63 games with 22 RBIs with the Tampa 
Yankees. He was 3rd in the Florida State League in batting average and 
led the league in stolen bases with 30. Gardner also was second in the 
league in walks with 47.[3] In 2007, he played 54 games for the Double-A 
Trenton Thunder, though he missed time with a broken bone in his hand. 
In 203 at bats, he stole 18 bases (tied for 5th in the league; while being 
caught 4 times), hit 5 triples, and batted .300 with a .392 OBP, before 
being promoted to the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees.[4][5] There, 
in 45 games he batted .260 with a .343 OBP, and stole 21 bases while being 
caught only 3 times.[6] In the fall of 2007, he played in 26 games in the 
Arizona Fall League, leading it in runs (27) and stolen bases (16), while 
being caught stealing only once. He batted .343 (5th in the league) with 
a .433 obp (3rd) and was 3rd in the league in walks (17).[7] In 2007, he 
was the 12th-best prospect in the Yankees minor league system according 
to Baseball America.[8] Playing for Scranton/Wilkes Barre in 2008, in 94 
games Gardner was 2nd in the International League with a .414 on-base percentage, 
70 walks, and 11 triples, and 6th in the IL with 37 stolen bases, while 
being caught only 9 times. Through 2008 in the minor leagues, he had a 
.291 batting average and a .389 OBP. He had stolen 153 bases, and been 
caught 31 times, an 83% success rate.[9] On June 30, 2008, Gardner was 
called up and made his major league debut,[10] batting lead-off and going 
0 for 3 with a stolen base. On July 2, he got both his first hit and first 
RBI off fellow rookie, Texas Rangers relief pitcher Warner Madrigal, in 
the seventh inning. Gardner went on to steal second and eventually score 
in that inning. On July 26, 2008, Gardner was optioned back to AAA after 
the acquisition of Xavier Nady in order to continue to receive playing 
time. The Yankees recalled Gardner on August 15 . On September 21, 2008, 
Gardner scored the final run of Major League Baseball in Yankee Stadium 
history as a pinch runner for Jason Giambi, scoring on a sacrifice fly 
by Robinson Canó in the seventh inning of an eventual 7–3 win for the Yankees 
over the Baltimore Orioles. Gardner finished his rookie season playing 
42 games batting .228 with 16 RBI and 13 stolen bases. Gardner was named 
the Yankees' starting center fielder for the 2009 season on March 29, 2009, 
beating out Melky Cabrera for the position; although Cabrera would eventually 
replace Gardner as the starting center fielder.[11][12] Gardner played 
108 games during the 2009 season batting .270 with 3 home runs, 23 RBI, 
and 26 stolen bases. Gardner was also part of the Yankees postseason run, 
appearing in all but one of the Yankees post season games and starting 
the final two games of the World Series, as the team won the World Series 
for the first time since 2000 by beating the Philadelphia Phillies.[13] 
Gardner began the 2010 season as the Yankees starting left fielder, taking 
over after Johnny Damon left in free agency, he finished the season with 
a .277 batting average and 47 stolen bases in 150 games. He also won the 
2010 Fielding Bible Award as the best defensive left fielder in MLB.[14][15] 
On December 7, 2010, Gardner underwent surgery to get rid of inflamed tissue 
in his wrist, with Yankees GM Brian Cashman supporting that he would be 
back in time for spring training [16] Gardner started the 2011 season hitting 
leadoff for the Yankees. He struggled in that role and was demoted to the 
bottom 3rd of the order. However, after Derek Jeter was put on the disabled 
list for a calf injury, Gardner was returned to the top of the order, alternating 
with Nick Swisher.[17] After Jeter's return, and Alex Rodriguez's stint 
on the DL for knee surgery, Gardner and Jeter periodically shared the top 
of the order, with Gardner as lead-off and Jeter batting 2nd. Gardner finished 
the 2011 season tied for first in the American League in stolen bases with 
Coco Crisp, each having 49 stolen bases.[18] Gardner won his second consecutive 
Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding left fielder in MLB.[19] Gardner 
played in 159 games batting .259 with 7 home runs and 36 RBI. Gardner and 
the Yankees agreed on a $2.8 million contract for the 2012 season, avoiding 
arbitration.[18] Gardner experienced an elbow injury in 2012 and was expected 
to return in August. On July 16, Gardner suffered a setback and his chances 
of missing the entire season increased.[20] On July 24, Gardner underwent 
right elbow surgery, performed by Christopher S. Ahmad, to remove a bone 
spur and inflamed tissue.[21] He was reactivated on September 25, 2012 
after Steve Pearce and Justin Thomas were designated for assignment. Gardner 
only played in 16 games during 2012 batting .323 with two stolen bases 
and 3 RBIs. With Curtis Granderson fracturing his right forearm during 
a spring training game, Gardner was moved to center field for the 2013 
season. On April 14, 2013, Gardner hit his first home run off a lefty since 
he hit his first grand slam off of Ricky Romero.[citation needed] For the 
week ending June 9, Gardner was named the AL Player of the Week.[22] On 
August 11, 2013, Gardner hit his first career walk-off home run with two 
outs in the bottom of the 9th inning off of Detroit Tigers reliever José 
Veras. The homer sealed a 5–4 victory for the Yankees, and helped give 
support to a struggling Mariano Rivera, who blew three consecutive save 
opportunities for the first time in his career. In the same series against 
Detroit two days earlier, Gardner made his first bailout of Rivera's pitching 
mishap by hitting a walk-off single past a diving Miguel Cabrera to give 
the Yankees a 4–3 win. According to Elias Sports Bureau, Gardner became 
the first Yankee since Claudell Washington in 1988 to have two walk-off 
hits in span of three or fewer games.[23] In 2013, Gardner played 145 games 
batting .273 with 8 home runs, 33 doubles, 10 triples, 52 RBI, and 24 stolen 
bases. On February 23, 2014, the Yankees and Gardner agreed to a four-year, 
$52 million extension to begin in 2015.[24] On April 23, 2014, Gardner 
made his first career start at right field. On July 28, 2014, Gardner recorded 
his first career multi-homer game where he hit 2 home runs off of Texas 
Rangers pitcher Yu Darvish.[citation needed] He was named AL Player of 
the Week on August 4.[25] On September 21, Gardner recorded the 15,000th 
home run of the Yankees franchise off the Blue Jays' Drew Hutchison.[26] 
Gardner struggled in September due to an injury, finishing 12-for-72 (.167).[27] 
Gardner was the Yankees' nominee for the Hank Aaron Award for the 2014 
season.[28] After the 2014 season, Gardner underwent surgery in his right 
arm to correct a rectus abdominis muscle injury that affected him in July 
and September.[27] Gardner was named AL Player of the Week for the week 
ending June 28, 2015.[29] He was one of the five candidates chosen for 
the All-Star Final Vote for the 2015 MLB All-Star Game,[30] but was later 
removed from the ballot after being chosen to replace the injured Alex 
Gordon on the All-Star team.[31] Garnder won the Gold Glove Award for the 
2016 season.[32] Gardner is considered one of the fastest players in Major 
League Baseball. He is best known for stealing bases and being very disciplined 
at the plate. He makes contact with 93% of his swings, third best in the 
American League.[33] In 2010, Gardner saw more pitches per at-bat than 
any other player in the American League.[34] Brett and his wife, Jessica, 
have two sons: Hunter and Miller.[35] His father, Jerry Gardner, played 
in the minors for the Phillies.[36] In the off-season, the Gardners reside
