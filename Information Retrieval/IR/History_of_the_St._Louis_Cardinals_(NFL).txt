National Football League (1960–1987) Division championships (2) The professional 
American football team now known as the Arizona Cardinals previously played 
in St. Louis, Missouri from 1960 to 1987. This article chronicles the team's 
history during their time as the St. Louis Cardinals. Chicago Cardinals 
owner Violet Bidwill had married St. Louis businessman Walter Wolfner in 
1949, two years after inheriting the team from her late first husband, 
Charles Bidwill. When it became obvious that the Cardinals could no longer 
hope to compete with the Chicago Bears, a move to St. Louis seemed to make 
sense. The NFL conducted a survey of St. Louis, and concluded that it was 
capable of supporting a team. The league's 12 owners unanimously approved 
the move, ending their 62-year stay in Chicago. During the Cardinals' tenure 
in St. Louis, they were called the "Big Red" or the "Football Cardinals" 
in order to avoid confusion with the baseball team[1] They shared Sportsman's 
Park with the baseball team. However, St. Louis had not had a professional 
football team since the early days of the NFL, and tickets were difficult 
to sell. The Cardinals initially held practices in the city park. Their 
first home game was a loss to the Giants on October 2, 1960, and they finished 
the year at 6–5–1. In 1961, they broke even at 7–7–0 (the NFL had expanded 
to a 14-game season to compete with the upstart AFL) and fell to 4–9–1 
in 1962. Improving to 9–5–0 in 1963, the Cardinals almost reached the playoffs, 
but a loss to the Giants prevented that. During the Cardinals' 28-year 
stay in St. Louis, they advanced to the playoffs just three times (1974, 
1975 & 1982), never hosting or winning in any appearance. In spite of what 
was considered lackluster performance in St. Louis, their overall record 
there (winning 187 games, losing 202, and 13 ties) (a winning percentage 
of .481) is easily the highest winning percentage for any of the three 
locations that the Cardinals have been associated with. The new St. Louis 
football Cardinals were competitive for much of the 1960s. New stars emerged 
in Larry Wilson, Charley Johnson, Jim Bakken, Sonny Randle, and Jim Hart. 
Violet Bidwill Wolfner died in 1962, and her sons, Bill and Charles, Jr. 
took control. Although the Cardinals were competitive again in the '60s, 
they failed to achieve a playoff appearance during the decade. Only four 
teams qualified during this period. In 1964, the Bidwills, unsatisfied 
with St. Louis, considered moving the team to Atlanta. They wanted a new 
stadium, and that city was planning the construction of one. However, St. 
Louis persuaded them to stay with the promise of a stadium—what would become 
Busch Memorial Stadium (a new expansion team, the Falcons, was eventually 
created for Atlanta, and a St. Louis team would move to Atlanta — the NBA 
Hawks in 1968). The Cardinals got off to a good start, and tied the Cleveland 
Browns 33–33 on the road. They finished 9–4–1 and second in the Eastern 
Conference, but a victory by the Browns over the New York Giants denied 
them a playoff berth. The team finished the year with a meaningless win 
over the Packers. A 4–1–0 start to the 1965 season evaporated into a 5–9–0 
finish. In 1966, the Cardinals were in first place in the Eastern Conference 
with an 8–2–1 record, but a loss to the Dallas Cowboys, who went on to 
win the conference title, started a three-game losing streak to end the 
season, leaving St. Louis at 8–5–1. Another middling season followed in 
1967, with six wins, seven losses, and one tie. In 1968, the Cardinals 
swept the Cleveland Browns and ended the year with a 9–4–1 mark, but a 
loss to San Francisco 49ers club and a tie against the woeful Pittsburgh 
Steelers kept the Cardinals out of the playoffs. St. Louis fell back to 
4–9–1 in 1969, but that season saw the debut of Roger Wehrli, a star safety 
at the University of Missouri who played 14 seasons for the Cardinals and 
was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2007. In 1970, the Cardinals 
were placed in the new NFC East division following the merger with the 
AFL. They posted three consecutive shutouts in November, blanking the Houston 
Oilers, Boston Patriots, and the Cowboys, the last of those victories coming 
38-0 on Monday Night Football in the Cotton Bowl. But St. Louis collapsed 
down the stretch, losing December games to the New York Giants, Detroit 
Lions and Washington Redskins to finish 8–5–1 and out of the playoffs. 
The Cardinals then regressed to three consecutive 4–9–1 seasons from 1971-73. 
Bill Bidwill became sole owner in 1972 and still owns the team. Only the 
New York Giants and Chicago Bears have been in the hands of one family 
longer than the Cardinals. Larry Wilson retired following the 1972 season, 
and in 1973, Don Coryell, who built a powerhouse program at San Diego State, 
became head coach. The Cardinals registered a 7–0–0 record to open the 
1974 season and won the NFC East championship—their first division or conference 
title since their unsuccessful title defense of 1948—on the strength of 
a season sweep of the Redskins. However, due to the NFL's unusual system 
in which the division champions rotated between home-field advantage, the 
Cardinals lost a chance to host a first-round playoff game since it was 
the NFC East champion's turn to go on the road. In the franchise's first 
playoff game since 1948, St. Louis took an early 7–0 lead against the Minnesota 
Vikings in Bloomington, Minnesota, but a missed field goal just before 
halftime sapped the Cardinals' momentum. The Vikings scored 16 points in 
the first seven minutes of the second half and cruised to a 30–14 victory. 
The Cardinals won the NFC East again in 1975, but were again locked out 
of playing at home in the first round because they were the lowest-seeded 
division champion. The playoff game against the Los Angeles Rams was a 
disaster: Lawrence McCutcheon set an NFL playoff record by rushing for 
202 yards, and Jack Youngblood and Bill Simpson returned interceptions 
for touchdowns, staking the Rams to a 28–9 halftime lead en route to a 
35–23 victory at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. During this period, 
the Cardinals boasted an effective offense in the wake of a record-setting 
offensive line which included standouts Jim Hart, Dan Dierdorf, Conrad 
Dobler, and Tom Banks. This period for the franchise was characterized 
by exciting close games, come-from-behind nailbiters, and several frustrating 
near-misses. The press and league fans began to call the team the "Cardiac 
Cardinals". Team stars from the 1970s included Wehrli, wide receiver Mel 
Gray, and running backs Terry Metcalf and Jim Otis. On Thanksgiving Day, 
1976, the Cardinals suffered a controversial loss to the Dallas Cowboys. 
Cardinals tight end J. V. Cain, running an apparent game-winning route, 
was shoved out of the end zone by Dallas defensive backs Cliff Harris and 
Charlie Waters in what appeared to be obvious interference, but a penalty 
was not called.[2] With this loss, the Cardinals were dethroned from the 
divisional lead and became the first NFC team to reach 10 wins without 
qualifying for the playoffs. Ultimately, the Redskins' sweep of the season 
series kept them out of the playoffs. In 1977, the Cardinals started slowly 
but won 6 consecutive games before losing the Thanksgiving Day game to 
the Miami Dolphins, 55–14. Bob Griese's record-setting day turned out to 
be the first of 12 straight losses for the Cardinals (extending into 1978), 
a streak which included being only the second team ever to lose to the 
previously winless Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the first to lose in Tampa 
Stadium. Coryell and several key players, including Dobler and Metcalf, 
departed the team at the end of the 1977 season. For the 1978 season, Bidwill 
hired Bud Wilkinson, famous for building a football dynasty in 17 seasons 
at the University of Oklahoma. But Wilkinson, who had been out of coaching 
since retiring from the Sooners following the 1963 season, could not turn 
the Cardinals around. St. Louis started 1978 with eight straight losses 
and finished at 6-10, and Wilkinson was fired in 1979 with the Cardinals 
at 3-10 and last in the NFC East. Wilkinson was canned by Bidwill for refusing 
to bench quarterback Jim Hart in favor of rookie Steve Pisarkiewicz. Larry 
Wilson, the Pro Football Hall of Fame safety who starred for the Cardinals 
for 13 seasons, coached the final three games of the 1979 season, finishing 
with a 5-11 record. The Cardinals experienced several years of notoriously 
poor drafts and unfortunate personnel moves in the late 1970s, typified 
by the first-round selection of kicker Steve Little, who was paralyzed 
in a 1980 automobile accident, and hiring Wilkinson in 1978. The team also 
suffered a tragic loss during 1979 training camp when Cain died of a heart 
attack. However, the Cardinals had some success in the early 1980s, posting 
three consecutive winning seasons from 1982 to 1984. The heart of this 
squad was the prolific trio of quarterback Neil Lomax, wide receiver Roy 
Green, and running back Ottis Anderson. Stellar performances by Anderson 
could not salvage the Cardinals' 1980 and 1981 campaigns, which ended at 
5–11 and 7–9, respectively. In 1982, the Cardinals qualified for the expanded 
16-team playoff field with a 5–4 mark in the strike-shortened year, but 
fell 41–16 to the Green Bay Packers. St. Louis finished 1983 at 8–7–1, 
including victories over the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Raiders 
and the Seattle Seahawks, who lost to the Raiders in the AFC championship 
game. The Cardinals entered the final weekend of 1984 with a chance to 
win the NFC East by defeating the Redskins, but Neil O'Donoghue missed 
a game-winning field goal at the gun, giving Washington a 29–27 victory 
and the division championship. St. Louis started 1985 3–1, but finished 
5–11, leading to the termination of coach Jim Hanifan after six seasons. 
Hanifan would return triumphantly to St. Louis, serving as offensive line 
coach during the St. Louis Rams' Super Bowl championship season. Gene Stallings, 
formerly the head coach at Texas A&M and a long-time assistant to Tom Landry 
with the Cowboys, replaced Hanifan. The Cardinals finished 4–11–1 in 1986, 
but improved to 7–8 in 1987, falling just one win shy of the playoffs, 
losing 21–16 on the final Sunday of the season to the Cowboys. The 1987 
season is remembered for a stunning comeback, rallying from a 28–3 deficit 
against the Buccaneers by scoring 28 points in the fourth quarter for a 
31–28 victory. It remains the largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history. 
The overall mediocrity of the Cardinals, combined with an old stadium, 
caused game attendance to dwindle, and once again the Bidwills decided 
to move the team, this time to either Baltimore, Phoenix, or Jacksonville. 
Nonetheless, Cardinals fans were unhappy at losing their team, and Bill 
Bidwill, fearing for his safety, stayed away from several of the 1987 home 
games. Their last home game was on December 13, 1987, in which the Cardinals 
won 27-24 over the New York Giants in front of 29,623 fans on a late Sunday 
afternoon.[citation needed] On March 16, 1988, the NFL team owners voted 
to allow Bidwill to move the Cardinals from St. Louis to Phoenix, Arizona 
for the 1988 NFL season.[3] The NFL returned to St. Louis in 1995, when 
the Los Angeles Rams relocated there. The Cardinals and Rams became divisional 
rivals in 2002 after the NFL realigned from six divisions to eight; this 
meant that the Cardinals, now in the NFC West, would play one game in St. 
Louis annually until 2016, when the Rams announced that they were relocating 
to Los Angeles for the second time (the first being from Cleveland in 1946) 
which meant St. Louis became the first city to have lost two NFL teams 
that have relocated to the Western United States and to larger media markets
