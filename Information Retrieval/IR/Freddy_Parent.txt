Frederick Alfred Parent (November 25, 1875 – November 2, 1972) was a professional 
baseball player. He played all or part of eleven seasons in Major League 
Baseball, between 1899 and 1911, for the St. Louis Perfectos (1899), Boston 
Americans (1901–07) and Chicago White Sox (1908–11), primarily as a shortstop. 
Parent batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Biddeford, Maine. 
Listed at 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m), 154 lb., Parent was known primarily for his 
fielding skills, but he also was a solid hitter and an intelligent baserunner. 
Twice he hit .300, including a career-high .306 in 1901, and led American 
League in at bats in 1902. He broke up three no-hit bids, as he got his 
club's only hits in these games. At shortstop, his fine defensive plays 
saved four no-hitters, including Cy Young's perfect game. He also was a 
member of the Boston team who clinched in 1903 the first World Championship 
in major league history. In a 12-season career, Parent was a .262 hitter 
(1306-for-4984) with 20 home runs and 471 RBI in 1327 games, including 
180 doubles, 74 triples, 633 runs and 184 stolen bases. In eight WS games, 
he hit .290 with eight runs and four RBI. In the fall of 1960, Parent appeared 
on the television program I've Got A Secret alongside Pittsburgh Pirate 
Tommy Leach, as a commemoration of participating in the first World Series 
in 1903. Parent died in Sanford, Maine, at the age of 96. At the time of 
his death, he was the last surviving participant of the inaugural 1903
