Coordinates: 60°N 95°W﻿ / ﻿60°N 95°W﻿ / 60; -95 Canada (i/ˈkænədə/; French: 
[ka.na.dɑ]) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten 
provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific 
and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres 
(3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country 
by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border 
with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority 
of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly 
areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of 
its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. 
About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized 
and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest metropolis 
is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, 
Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. Canada has been inhabited 
for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the 16th century, 
British and French claims were made on the area, with the colony of Canada 
first being established by the French in 1537. As a consequence of various 
conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost territories within British 
North America until it was left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly 
geographically comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America 
Act, on July 1, 1867, the colonies of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia 
joined to form the semi-autonomous federal Dominion of Canada. This began 
an accretion of provinces and territories to the mostly self-governing 
Dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming modern 
Canada. In 1931, Canada achieved near total independence from the United 
Kingdom with the Statute of Westminster 1931, and full sovereignty was 
attained when the Canada Act 1982 removed the last remaining ties of legal 
dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Canada is a federal 
parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth 
II being the head of state. The country is officially bilingual at the 
federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural 
nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries. 
Its advanced economy is the eleventh largest in the world, relying chiefly 
upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade 
networks. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States 
has had a significant impact on its economy and culture. Canada is a developed 
country and has the tenth highest nominal per capita income globally as 
well as the ninth highest ranking in the Human Development Index. It ranks 
among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, 
civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. Canada 
is a Commonwealth realm member of the Commonwealth of Nations, a member 
of the Francophonie, and part of several major international and intergovernmental 
institutions or groupings including the United Nations, the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization, the G8, the Group of Ten, the G20, the North American 
Free Trade Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. While 
a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins 
of Canada, the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian 
word kanata, meaning "village" or "settlement".[9] In 1535, indigenous 
inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct 
French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.[10] Cartier 
later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village, 
but the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[10] 
by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region 
along the St Lawrence River as Canada.[10] From the 16th to the early 18th 
century "Canada" referred to the part of New France that lay along the 
St. Lawrence River.[11] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called 
Upper Canada and Lower Canada collectively named The Canadas; until their 
union as the British Province of Canada in 1841.[12] Upon Confederation 
in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country, and 
the word Dominion was conferred as the country's title.[13] The transition 
away from the use of Dominion was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage 
of the Canada Act, which refers only to Canada. Later that year, the name 
of national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day.[14] The 
term Dominion is also used to distinguish the federal government from the 
provinces, though after the Second World War the term federal had replaced 
dominion.[15] Aboriginal peoples in present-day Canada include the First 
Nations, Inuit, and Métis,[16] the latter being a mixed-blood people who 
originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations and Inuit people 
married European settlers.[16] The first inhabitants of North America migrated 
from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge[17] and arrived at least 
15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.[18] 
The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves 
are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.[19][20] The 
characteristics of Canadian Aboriginal societies included permanent settlements, 
agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks.[21][22] 
Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived 
in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered 
through archeological investigations.[23] The Aboriginal population at 
the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 
200,000[24] and two million,[25] with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's 
Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.[26] As a consequence of contact 
with European diseases, Canada's Aboriginal peoples suffered from repeated 
outbreaks of newly introduced infectious diseases, such as influenza, measles, 
and smallpox (to which they had no natural immunity), resulting in a forty 
to eighty percent population decrease in the centuries after the European 
arrival.[24][27] Although not without conflict, European Canadians' early 
interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful.[28] 
The Crown and Aboriginal peoples began interactions during the European 
colonialization period, though, the Inuit, in general, had more limited 
interaction with European settlers.[29] From the late 18th century, European 
Canadians encouraged Aboriginals to assimilate into their own culture.[30] 
These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries 
with forced integration and relocations.[31] A period of redress is underway, 
which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
of Canada by the Canadian government.[32] The first known attempt at European 
colonization began when Norsemen settled briefly at L'Anse aux Meadows 
in Newfoundland around 1000 AD.[33] No further European exploration occurred 
until 1497, when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's 
Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England.[34][35] Then Basque 
and Portuguese mariners established seasonal whaling and fishing outposts 
along the Atlantic coast in the early 16th century.[36] In 1534, French 
explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Saint Lawrence River, where, on July 
24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words "Long Live the 
King of France" and took possession of the territory (known as the colony 
of Canada) in the name of King Francis I.[37] In general the settlements 
appear to have been short-lived, possibly due to the similarity of outputs 
producible in Scandinavia and northern Canada and the problems of navigating 
trade routes at that time.[38] In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal 
prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St. John's, Newfoundland, as 
the first North American English colony.[39] French explorer Samuel de 
Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent European 
settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608).[40] Among 
the colonists of New France, Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence 
River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes, while fur 
traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, 
and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana.[41] The Beaver Wars broke out 
in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.[42] 
The English established additional colonies in Cupids and Ferryland, Newfoundland, 
beginning in 1610.[43] The Thirteen Colonies to the south were founded 
soon after.[36] A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America 
between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North 
American theatre of the Seven Years' War.[44] Mainland Nova Scotia came 
under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and the 1763 Treaty 
of Paris ceded Canada and most of New France to Britain after the Seven 
Years' War.[45] The Royal Proclamation of 1763 created the Province of 
Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia.[14] 
St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 
1769.[46] To avert conflict in Quebec, the British parliament passed the 
Quebec Act of 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and 
Ohio Valley.[47] It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, 
and French civil law there. This angered many residents of the Thirteen 
Colonies, fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the 1775 
outbreak of the American Revolution.[14] The 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized 
American independence and ceded the newly added territories south (but 
not north) of the Great Lakes to the new United States.[48] New Brunswick 
was split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements 
in the Maritimes. To accommodate English-speaking Loyalists in Quebec, 
the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province into French-speaking 
Lower Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario), 
granting each its own elected legislative assembly.[49] The Canadas were 
the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and Britain. 
Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed. Immigration now resumed 
at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain 1815-50.[50] 
New arrivals included Irish refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as 
well as Gaelic-speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances.[51] 
Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 per cent of Europeans who 
immigrated to Canada before 1891.[24] The desire for responsible government 
resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837. The Durham Report subsequently 
recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians 
into English culture.[14] The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into 
a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established 
for all provinces of British North America by 1849.[52] The signing of 
the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon 
boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. 
This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and 
in British Columbia (1858).[53] Following several constitutional conferences, 
the 1867 Constitution Act officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation 
on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, 
and New Brunswick.[54][55] Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and 
the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the 
Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the 
province of Manitoba in July 1870.[56] British Columbia and Vancouver Island 
(which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871, while 
Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.[57] The Canadian parliament passed 
a bill introduced by the Conservative Cabinet that established a National 
Policy of tariffs to protect the nascent Canadian manufacturing industries.[55] 
To open the West, parliament also approved sponsoring the construction 
of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), 
opening the prairies to settlement with the Dominion Lands Act, and establishing 
the North-West Mounted Police to assert its authority over this territory.[58][59] 
In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, parliament 
created the Yukon Territory. The Cabinet of Liberal Prime Minister Wilfrid 
Laurier fostered continental European immigrants settling the prairies 
and Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905.[57] Because Britain 
still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the Confederation 
Act, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into World 
War I.[60] Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the 
Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge 
and other major engagements of the war.[61] Out of approximately 625,000 
Canadians who served in World War I, some 60,000 were killed and another 
172,000 were wounded.[62] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when 
the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number 
of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from 
French-speaking Quebecers.[63] The Military Service Act brought in compulsory 
military service, though it, coupled with disputes over French language 
schools outside Quebec, deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily 
split the Liberal Party.[63] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations 
independently of Britain,[61] and the 1931 Statute of Westminster affirmed 
Canada's independence.[2] The Great Depression in Canada during the early 
1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country.[64] 
In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) 
in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered 
by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s.[65] On the advice of Prime Minister 
William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 
10, 1939 by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay 
underscored Canada's independence.[61] The first Canadian Army units arrived 
in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in 
the armed forces during World War II and approximately 42,000 were killed 
and another 55,000 were wounded.[66] Canadian troops played important roles 
in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, 
the Allied invasion of Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy, 
and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944.[61] Canada provided asylum for the 
Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands 
for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Germany.[67] The Canadian 
economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel 
for Canada, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union.[61] Despite another Conscription 
Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and 
strong economy.[68] The financial crisis of the great depression had led 
the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 
and become a crown colony ruled by a British governor. After two bitter 
referendums, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.[69] 
Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive 
Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity, marked 
by the adoption of the current Maple Leaf Flag in 1965,[70] the implementation 
of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969,[71] and the institution 
of official multiculturalism in 1971.[72] Socially democratic programs 
were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada 
Student Loans, though provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, 
opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.[73] Finally, 
another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the 1982 patriation 
of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[74] In 1999, Nunavut became 
Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal 
government.[75] At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and 
economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, giving birth 
to a modern nationalist movement. The radical Front de libération du Québec 
(FLQ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings 
in 1970[76] and the sovereignist Parti Québécois was elected in 1976, organizing 
an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts 
to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake 
Accord failed in 1990.[77] This led to the formation of the Bloc Québécois 
in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West.[78][79] 
A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected 
by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent.[80] In 1997, the Supreme Court 
ruled that unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional 
and the Clarity Act was passed by parliament, outlining the terms of a 
negotiated departure from Confederation.[77] In addition to the issues 
of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the 
late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 
182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history;[81] the École 
Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female 
students;[82] and the Oka Crisis of 1990,[83] the first of a number of 
violent confrontations between the government and Aboriginal groups.[84] 
Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a US-led coalition force 
and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including 
the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia.[85] Canada sent troops to 
Afghanistan in 2001, but declined to join the US-led invasion of Iraq in 
2003.[86] In 2009, Canada's economy suffered in the worldwide Great Recession, 
but it has since largely rebounded.[87][88] In 2011, Canadian forces participated 
in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan civil war,[89] and also became 
involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s.[90] 
Canada occupies much of the continent of North America, sharing land borders 
with the contiguous United States to the south, and the US state of Alaska 
to the northwest. Canada stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east 
to the Pacific Ocean in the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean.[91] 
Greenland is to the northeast. By total area (including its waters), Canada 
is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia. By land area 
alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, the difference being due to it having 
the worlds largest proportion of fresh water lakes.[92] Since 1925, Canada 
has claimed the portion of the Arctic between 60° and 141°W longitude,[93] 
but this claim is not universally recognized. Canada is home to the world's 
northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern 
tip of Ellesmere Island – latitude 82.5°N – which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) 
from the North Pole.[94] Much of the Canadian Arctic is covered by ice 
and permafrost. Canada has the longest coastline in the world, with a total 
length of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi);[95] additionally, its border 
with the United States is the world's longest land border, stretching 8,891 
kilometres (5,525 mi).[96] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada 
has consisted of eight distinct forest regions, including extensive boreal 
forest on the Canadian Shield.[97] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes (563 
greater than 100 km2 (39 sq mi)), more than any other country, containing 
much of the world's fresh water.[98][99] There are also fresh-water glaciers 
in the Canadian Rockies and the Coast Mountains. Canada is geologically 
active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably 
Mount Meager, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic 
complex.[100] The volcanic eruption of the Tseax Cone in 1775 was among 
Canada's worst natural disasters, killing 2,000 Nisga'a people and destroying 
their village in the Nass River valley of northern British Columbia. The 
eruption produced a 22.5-kilometre (14.0 mi) lava flow, and, according 
to Nisga'a legend, blocked the flow of the Nass River.[101] Canada's population 
density, at 3.3 inhabitants per square kilometre (8.5/sq mi), is among 
the lowest in the world. The most densely populated part of the country 
is the Quebec City – Windsor Corridor, situated in Southern Quebec and 
Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.[102] 
Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region 
to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly 
in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, 
where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below 
−40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills.[103] In noncoastal regions, snow 
can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts 
of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has 
a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west 
coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s 
°F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges 
from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations 
occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).[104] Canada has a parliamentary 
system within the context of a constitutional monarchy, the monarchy of 
Canada being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial 
branches.[105][106][107] The sovereign is Queen Elizabeth II, who is also 
monarch of 15 other Commonwealth countries and each of Canada's 10 provinces. 
As such, the Queen's representative, the Governor General of Canada (at 
present David Johnston), carries out most of the federal royal duties in 
Canada.[108][109] The direct participation of the royal and viceroyal figures 
in areas of governance is limited.[107][110][111] In practice, their use 
of the executive powers is directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers 
of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and 
headed by the Prime Minister of Canada (at present Justin Trudeau),[112] 
the head of government. The governor general or monarch may, though, in 
certain crisis situations exercise their power without ministerial advice.[110] 
To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually 
appoint as prime minister the person who is the current leader of the political 
party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Commons.[113] 
The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus one of the most powerful institutions 
in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and 
selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the 
governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, 
and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies.[110] The leader 
of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the Leader of Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary 
system intended to keep the government in check.[114] Each of the 338 members 
of parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in 
an electoral district or riding. General elections must be called by the 
governor general, either on the advice of the prime minister, or if the 
government loses a confidence vote in the House.[115][116] Constitutionally, 
an election may be held no more than five years after the preceding election, 
although the Canada Elections Act currently limits this to four years with 
a fixed election date in October. The 105 members of the Senate, whose 
seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75.[117] Five 
parties had representatives elected to the federal parliament in the 2015 
election: the Liberal Party of Canada who currently form the government, 
the Conservative Party of Canada who are the Official Opposition, the New 
Democratic Party, the Bloc Québécois, and the Green Party of Canada. The 
list of historical parties with elected representation is substantial. 
Canada's federal structure divides government responsibilities between 
the federal government and the ten provinces. Provincial legislatures are 
unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of 
Commons.[111] Canada's three territories also have legislatures, but these 
are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the 
provinces.[118] The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from 
their provincial counterparts.[119] The Bank of Canada is the central bank 
of the country. In addition, the Minister of Finance and Minister of Industry 
utilize the Statistics Canada agency for financial planning and economic 
policy development.[120] The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized 
to issue currency in the form of Canadian bank notes.[121] The bank does 
not issue Canadian coins; they are issued by the Royal Canadian Mint.[122] 
The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country, and consists 
of written text and unwritten conventions. The Constitution Act, 1867 (known 
as the British North America Act prior to 1982), affirmed governance based 
on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial 
governments. The Statute of Westminster 1931 granted full autonomy and 
the Constitution Act, 1982, ended all legislative ties to the UK, as well 
as adding a constitutional amending formula and the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. The Charter guarantees basic rights and freedoms that 
usually cannot be over-ridden by any government—though a notwithstanding 
clause allows the federal parliament and provincial legislatures to override 
certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years.[123] The Indian 
Act, various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations 
between Europeans and native peoples.[124] Most notably, a series of eleven 
treaties known as the Numbered Treaties were signed between Aboriginals 
in Canada and the reigning Monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921.[125] 
These treaties are agreements with the Canadian Crown-in-Council, administered 
by Canadian Aboriginal law, and overseen by the Minister of Aboriginal 
Affairs and Northern Development. The role of the treaties and the rights 
they support were reaffirmed by Section Thirty-five of the Constitution 
Act, 1982.[124] These rights may include provision of services, such as 
health care, and exemption from taxation.[126] The legal and policy framework 
within which Canada and First Nations operate was further formalized in 
2005, through the First Nations–Federal Crown Political Accord.[124] Canada's 
judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power 
to strike down Acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme 
Court of Canada is the highest court and final arbiter and has been led 
since 2000 by the Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin (the first female Chief 
Justice).[127] Its nine members are appointed by the governor general on 
the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice. All judges at 
the superior and appellate levels are appointed after consultation with 
nongovernmental legal bodies. The federal Cabinet also appoints justices 
to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions.[128] 
Common law prevails everywhere except in Quebec, where civil law predominates. 
Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout 
Canada.[129] Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially 
a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police 
forces.[130] However, in most rural areas and some urban areas, policing 
responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police.[131] 
Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs 
with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions.[133] Canada's foreign 
policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out 
through coalitions and international organizations, and through the work 
of numerous federal institutions.[134] Canada's peacekeeping role during 
the 20th century has played a major role in its global image.[135] The 
strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis 
to meet the Millennium Development Goals, while also providing assistance 
in response to foreign humanitarian crises.[136] Canada was a founding 
member of the United Nations and has membership in the World Trade Organization, 
the G20 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD).[133] Canada is also a member of various other international and 
regional organizations and forums for economic and cultural affairs.[137] 
Canada acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
in 1976.[138] Canada joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 
1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in 2000 and the 3rd Summit of 
the Americas in 2001.[139] Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim 
economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum 
(APEC).[140] Canada and the United States share the world's longest undefended 
border, co-operate on military campaigns and exercises, and are each other's 
largest trading partner.[141][142] Canada nevertheless has an independent 
foreign policy, most notably maintaining full relations with Cuba since, 
and declining to officially participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[143] 
Canada also maintains historic ties to the United Kingdom and France and 
to other former British and French colonies through Canada's membership 
in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Francophonie.[144] Canada is noted 
for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, 
to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II.[67] Canada's 
strong attachment to the British Empire and Commonwealth led to major participation 
in British military efforts in the Second Boer War, World War I and World 
War II. Since then, Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism, making 
efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.[145][146] 
During the Cold War, Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the 
Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) 
in co-operation with the United States to defend against potential aerial 
attacks from the Soviet Union.[147] During the Suez Crisis of 1956, future 
Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception 
of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, for which he was awarded the 
1957 Nobel Peace Prize.[148] As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission, 
Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept.[149] Canada has 
since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping 
effort until 1989,[61] and has since maintained forces in international 
missions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere; Canada has sometimes 
faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in 
the 1993 Somalia Affair.[150] In 2001, Canada deployed troops to Afghanistan 
as part of the US stabilization force and the UN-authorized, NATO-led International 
Security Assistance Force.[151] In February 2007, Canada, Italy, the United 
Kingdom, Norway, and Russia announced their joint commitment to a $1.5-billion 
project to help develop vaccines for developing nations, and called on 
other countries to join them.[152] In August 2007, Canada's territorial 
claims in the Arctic were challenged after a Russian underwater expedition 
to the North Pole; Canada has considered that area to be sovereign territory 
since 1925.[153] Canada currently employs a professional, volunteer military 
force of 92,000 active personnel and approximately 51,000 reserve personnel.[154] 
The unified Canadian Forces (CF) comprise the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian 
Navy, and Royal Canadian Air Force. In 2013, Canada's military expenditure 
totalled approximately C$19 billion, or around 1% of the country's GDP.[155][156] 
Canada is a federation composed of ten provinces and three territories. 
In turn, these may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central 
Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to 
Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy 
than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as health 
care, education, and welfare.[157] Together, the provinces collect more 
revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations 
in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate 
national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act; the 
provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. Equalization 
payments are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform 
standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer 
provinces.[158] Canada is the world's eleventh-largest economy as of 2015[update], 
with a nominal GDP of approximately US$1.79 trillion.[159] It is a member 
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and 
the Group of Eight (G8), and is one of the world's top ten trading nations, 
with a highly globalized economy.[160][161] Canada is a mixed economy, 
ranking above the US and most western European nations on the Heritage 
Foundation's index of economic freedom,[162] and experiencing a relatively 
low level of income disparity.[163] The country's average household disposable 
income per capita is over US$23,900, higher than the OECD average.[164] 
Furthermore, the Toronto Stock Exchange is the seventh largest stock exchange 
in the world by market capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with 
a combined market capitalization of over US$2 trillion as of 2015[update].[165] 
In 2014, Canada's exports totalled over C$528 billion, while its imported 
goods were worth over $523 billion, of which approximately $349 billion 
originated from the United States, $49 billion from the European Union, 
and $35 billion from China.[166] The country's 2014 trade surplus totalled 
C$5.1 billion, compared with a C$46.9 billion surplus in 2008.[167][168] 
Since the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, 
and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy 
to an urbanized, industrial one. Like many other developed nations, the 
Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about 
three-quarters of the country's workforce.[169] However, Canada is unusual 
among developed countries in the importance of its primary sector, in which 
the forestry and petroleum industries are two of the most prominent components.[170] 
Canada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy.[172] 
Atlantic Canada possesses vast offshore deposits of natural gas, and Alberta 
also hosts large oil and gas resources. The vastness of the Athabasca oil 
sands and other assets results in Canada having a 13% share of global oil 
reserves, comprising the world's third-largest share after Venezuela and 
Saudi Arabia.[173] Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers 
of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies are one of the most important 
global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains.[174] Canada's Ministry 
of Natural Resources provides statistics regarding its major exports; the 
country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, aluminum, 
steel, iron ore, coking coal and lead.[175] Many towns in northern Canada, 
where agriculture is difficult, are sustainable because of nearby mines 
or sources of timber. Canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred 
in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing 
particularly important industries.[176] Canada's economic integration with 
the United States has increased significantly since World War II.[177] 
The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders 
to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns 
over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing 
sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to 
enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review 
Agency (FIRA).[178] In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive 
Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment 
Canada, to encourage foreign investment.[179] The Canada – United States 
Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, 
while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade 
zone to include Mexico in 1994.[174] In the mid-1990s, Jean Chrétien's 
Liberal government began to post annual budgetary surpluses, and steadily 
paid down the national debt.[180] The global financial crisis of 2008 caused 
a major recession, which led to a significant rise in unemployment in Canada.[181] 
By October 2009, Canada's national unemployment rate had reached 8.6 percent, 
with provincial unemployment rates varying from a low of 5.8 percent in 
Manitoba to a high of 17 percent in Newfoundland and Labrador.[182] Between 
October 2008 and October 2010, the Canadian labour market lost 162,000 
full-time jobs and a total of 224,000 permanent jobs.[183] Canada's federal 
debt was estimated to total $566.7 billion for the fiscal year 2010–11, 
up from $463.7 billion in 2008–09.[184] In addition, Canada's net foreign 
debt rose by $41 billion to $194 billion in the first quarter of 2010.[185] 
However, Canada's regulated banking sector (comparatively conservative 
among G8 nations), the federal government's pre-crisis budgetary surpluses, 
and its long-term policies of lowering the national debt, resulted in a 
less severe recession compared to other G8 nations.[186] As of 2015[update], 
the Canadian economy has largely stabilized and has seen a modest return 
to growth, although the country remains troubled by volatile oil prices, 
sensitivity to the Eurozone crisis and higher-than-normal unemployment 
rates.[187][188] The federal government and many Canadian industries have 
also started to expand trade with emerging Asian markets, in an attempt 
to diversify exports; Asia is now Canada's second-largest export market 
after the United States.[189][190] Widely debated oil pipeline proposals, 
in particular, are hoped to increase exports of Canadian oil reserves to 
China.[191][192] In 2012, Canada spent approximately C$31.3 billion on 
domestic research and development, of which around $7 billion was provided 
by the federal and provincial governments.[193] As of 2015[update], the 
country has produced thirteen Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and 
medicine,[194][195] and was ranked fourth worldwide for scientific research 
quality in a major 2012 survey of international scientists.[196] It is 
furthermore home to the headquarters of a number of global technology firms.[197] 
Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world, with 
over 33 million users, equivalent to around 94 percent of its total 2014 
population.[198] The Canadian Space Agency operates a highly active space 
program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and aviation research, and developing 
rockets and satellites. Canada was the third country to launch a satellite 
into space after the USSR and the United States, with the 1962 Alouette 
1 launch.[199] In 1984, Marc Garneau became Canada's first male astronaut. 
Canada is a participant in the International Space Station (ISS), and is 
a pioneer in space robotics, having constructed the Canadarm, Canadarm2 
and Dextre robotic manipulators for the ISS and NASA's Space Shuttle. Since 
the 1960s, Canada's aerospace industry has designed and built numerous 
marques of satellite, including Radarsat-1 and 2, ISIS and MOST.[200] Canada 
has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely used sounding 
rockets, the Black Brant; over 1,000 Black Brants have been launched since 
the rocket's introduction in 1961.[201] The 2011 Canadian census counted 
a total population of 33,476,688, an increase of around 5.9 percent over 
the 2006 figure.[202] By December 2012, Statistics Canada reported a population 
of over 35 million, signifying the fastest growth rate of any G8 nation.[203] 
Between 1990 and 2008, the population increased by 5.6 million, equivalent 
to 20.4 percent overall growth.[204] The main drivers of population growth 
are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth.[205] Canada has 
one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world,[206] driven 
mainly by economic policy and, to a lesser extent family reunification.[207][208] 
The Canadian public as-well as the major political parties support the 
current level of immigration.[207][209][210] In 2010, a record 280,636 
people immigrated to Canada.[211] The Canadian government anticipated between 
280,000 and 305,000 new permanent residents in 2016,[212] a similar number 
of immigrants as in recent years.[213] New immigrants settle mostly in 
major urban areas such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.[214] Canada 
also accepts large numbers of refugees,[215] accounting for over 10 percent 
of annual global refugee resettlements.[216] About four-fifths of the population 
lives within 150 kilometres (93 mi) of the contiguous United States border.[217] 
Approximately 50 percent of Canadians live in urban areas concentrated 
along the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor,[218] with an additional 30 percent 
living along the British Columbia Lower Mainland, and the Calgary–Edmonton 
Corridor in Alberta.[219] Canada spans latitudinally from the 83rd parallel 
north to the 41st parallel north, and approximately 95% of the population 
is found below the 55th parallel north.[218] In common with many other 
developed countries, Canada is experiencing a demographic shift towards 
an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. 
In 2006, the average age was 39.5 years;[220] by 2011, it had risen to 
approximately 39.9 years.[221] As of 2013[update], the average life expectancy 
for Canadians is 81 years.[222] The majority of Canadians (69.9%) live 
in family households, 26.8% report living alone, and those living with 
unrelated persons reported at 3.7%.[223] The average size of a household 
in 2006 was 2.5 people.[223] According to a 2012 report by the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Canada is the most educated 
country in the world;[224] the country ranks first worldwide in the number 
of adults having tertiary education, with 51 percent of Canadian adults 
having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree.[224] 
Canada spends about 5.3% of its GDP on education.[225] The country invests 
heavily in tertiary education (more than 20 000 USD per student).[226] 
As of 2014[update], 89 percent of adults aged 25 to 64 have earned the 
equivalent of a high-school degree, compared to an OECD average of 75 percent.[164] 
Since the adoption of section 23 of the Constitution Act, 1982, education 
in both English and French has been available in most places across Canada.[227] 
Canadian provinces and territories are responsible for education provision.[228] 
The mandatory school age ranges between 5–7 to 16–18 years,[229] contributing 
to an adult literacy rate of 99 percent.[91] In 2002, 43 percent of Canadians 
aged 25 to 64 possessed a post-secondary education; for those aged 25 to 
34, the rate of post-secondary education reached 51 percent.[230] The Programme 
for International Student Assessment indicates that Canadian students perform 
well above the OECD average, particularly in mathematics, science, and 
reading.[231][232] Self-reported ethnic origins of Canadians (as per 2011 
census data)[233] According to the 2006 census, the country's largest self-reported 
ethnic origin is Canadian (accounting for 32% of the population), followed 
by English (21%), French (15.8%), Scottish (15.1%), Irish (13.9%), German 
(10.2%), Italian (4.6%), Chinese (4.3%), First Nations (4.0%), Ukrainian 
(3.9%), and Dutch (3.3%).[234] There are 600 recognized First Nations governments 
or bands, encompassing a total of 1,172,790 people.[235] Canada's Aboriginal 
population is growing at almost twice the national rate, and four percent 
of Canada's population claimed Aboriginal identity in 2006. Another 16.2 
percent of the population belonged to a non-Aboriginal visible minority.[236] 
In 2006, the largest visible minority groups were South Asian (4.0%), Chinese 
(3.9%) and Black (2.5%). Between 2001 and 2006, the visible minority population 
rose by 27.2 percent.[237] In 1961, less than two percent of Canada's population 
(about 300,000 people) were members of visible minority groups.[238] By 
2007, almost one in five (19.8%) were foreign-born, with nearly 60 percent 
of new immigrants coming from Asia (including the Middle East).[239] The 
leading sources of immigrants to Canada were China, the Philippines and 
India.[240] According to Statistics Canada, visible minority groups could 
account for a third of the Canadian population by 2031.[241] Canada is 
religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and customs. 
Canada has no official church, and the government is officially committed 
to religious pluralism.[243] Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally 
protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation 
or interference.[244] The practice of religion is now generally considered 
a private matter throughout society and the state.[245] With Christianity 
in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture 
and daily life,[246] Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state.[247][248][249][250] 
The majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their 
daily lives,[251] but still believe in God.[252] According to the 2011 
census, 67.3% of Canadians identify as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics 
make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7% of the population. The 
largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada (accounting 
for 6.1% of Canadians), followed by Anglicans (5.0%), and Baptists (1.9%).[253] 
Secularization has been growing since the 1960s.[254][255] In 2011, 23.9% 
declared no religious affiliation, compared to 16.5% in 2001.[256] The 
remaining 8.8% are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest 
of which are Islam (3.2%) and Hinduism (1.5%).[253] A multitude of languages 
are used by Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) 
being the mother tongues of approximately 60% and 20% of Canadians respectively.[258] 
Nearly 6.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother 
tongue.[259] Some of the most common non-official first languages include 
Chinese (mainly Cantonese; 1,072,555 first-language speakers), Punjabi 
(430,705), Spanish (410,670), German (409,200), and Italian (407,490).[260] 
Canada's federal government practices official bilingualism, which is applied 
by the Commissioner of Official Languages in consonance with Section 16 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Federal Official 
Languages Act English and French have equal status in federal courts, parliament, 
and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is 
sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English 
or French and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools 
in all provinces and territories.[261] The 1977 Charter of the French Language 
established French as the official language of Quebec.[262] Although more 
than 85 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are 
substantial Francophone populations in New Brunswick, Alberta, and Manitoba; 
Ontario has the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec.[263] 
New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has a French-speaking 
Acadian minority constituting 33 percent of the population.[264] There 
are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton 
Island, and through central and western Prince Edward Island.[265] Other 
provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language 
of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition 
to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French 
to be spoken in the provincial legislatures, and laws are enacted in both 
languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official.[266] 
There are 11 Aboriginal language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct 
languages and dialects.[267] Of these, only the Cree, Inuktitut and Ojibway 
languages have a large enough population of fluent speakers to be considered 
viable to survive in the long term.[268] Several Aboriginal languages have 
official status in the Northwest Territories.[269] Inuktitut is the majority 
language in Nunavut, and is one of three official languages in the territory.[270] 
Additionally, Canada is home to many sign languages, two of which are Indigenous. 
American Sign Language (ASL), is spoken across the country due to the prevalence 
of ASL in primary and secondary schools.[271] Quebec Sign Language (LSQ), 
is spoken primarily in Quebec, however there are sizeable population centres 
in francophone communities in New Brunswick, Ontario and Manitoba; due 
to its historical relation to the francophone culture.[272] Plains Sign 
Talk was the most widespread language in North America prior to colonization, 
spoken across the Prairies by a number of First Nations.[273] Inuit Uukturausingit 
is used by Inuit in Nunavut.[274] Maritime Sign Language was used in Nova 
Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island before ASL became available 
in the mid-20th century.[275] Canada's culture draws influences from its 
broad range of constituent nationalities, and policies that promote a "just 
society" are constitutionally protected.[276][277] Canada has placed emphasis 
on equality and inclusiveness for all its people.[278] Multiculturalism 
is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments,[279] and 
a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity.[280][281] In Quebec, 
cultural identity is strong, and many commentators speak of a culture of 
Quebec that is distinct from English Canadian culture.[282] However, as 
a whole, Canada is in theory a cultural mosaic—a collection of several 
regional, Aboriginal, and ethnic subcultures.[283] Canada's approach to 
governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective immigration, 
social integration, and suppression of far right politics, has wide public 
support.[284] Government policies such as publicly funded health care, 
higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, 
strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, and the legalization 
of same-sex marriage are further social indicators of Canada's political 
and cultural values.[285] Canadians also identify with the country's health 
care institutions, peacekeeping, the National park system and the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[280][286] Historically, Canada has been 
influenced by British, French, and Aboriginal cultures and traditions. 
Through their language, art and music, Aboriginal peoples continue to influence 
the Canadian identity.[287] During the 20th century Canadians with African, 
Caribbean and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and 
its culture.[288] Canadian humour is an integral part of the Canadian Identity 
and is reflected in its folklore, literature, music, art and media. The 
primary characteristics of Canadian humour are irony, parody, and satire.[289] 
Many Canadian comedians have archived international success in the American 
TV and film industries and are amongst the most recognized in the world.[290] 
Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output; particularly 
in English films, television shows, and magazines, is often overshadowed 
by imports from the United States.[291] As a result, the preservation of 
a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, 
laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), 
the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television 
and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).[292] Canada's national symbols 
are influenced by natural, historical, and Aboriginal sources. The use 
of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. 
The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags, and 
on the Arms of Canada.[294] The Arms of Canada is closely modelled after 
the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom with French and distinctive 
Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British 
version.[295] The Great Seal of Canada is a governmental seal used for 
purposes of state, being set on letters patent, proclamations and commissions, 
for representatives of the Queen and for the appointment of cabinet ministers, 
lieutenant governors, senators, and judges.[296][297] Other prominent symbols 
include the beaver, Canada goose, common loon, the Crown, the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police,[294] and more recently, the totem pole and Inuksuk.[298] 
Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, 
the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, the beaver on the nickel.[299] The 
penny, removed from circulation in 2013, featured the maple leaf.[300] 
The Queen' s image appears on $20 bank notes, and on the obverse of all 
current Canadian coins.[299] Canadian literature is often divided into 
French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary 
traditions of France and Britain, respectively.[301] There are four major 
themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature; nature, 
frontier life, Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie 
into the garrison mentality.[302] By the 1990s, Canadian literature was 
viewed as some of the world's best.[303] Canada's ethnic and cultural diversity 
are reflected in its literature, with many of its most prominent modern 
writers focusing on ethnic life.[304] Arguably, the best-known living Canadian 
writer internationally (especially since the deaths of Robertson Davies 
and Mordecai Richler) is Margaret Atwood, a prolific novelist, poet, and 
literary critic.[305] Numerous other Canadian authors have accumulated 
international literary awards;[306] including Nobel Laureate Alice Munro, 
who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English;[307] 
and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who is perhaps best known 
for the novel The English Patient, which was adapted as a film of the same 
name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.[308] Canadian visual 
art has been dominated by figures such as Tom Thomson – the country's most 
famous painter – and by the Group of Seven.[309] Thomson's career painting 
Canadian landscapes spanned a decade up to his death in 1917 at age 39.[310] 
The Group were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who 
first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to 
as having seven members, five artists—Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Arthur 
Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley—were responsible for articulating 
the Group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston, and by commercial 
artist Franklin Carmichael. A. J. Casson became part of the Group in 1926.[311] 
Associated with the Group was another prominent Canadian artist, Emily 
Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples 
of the Pacific Northwest Coast.[312] Since the 1950s, works of Inuit art 
have been given as gifts to foreign dignitaries by the Canadian government.[313] 
The Canadian music industry is the sixth largest in the world producing 
internationally renowned composers, musicians and ensembles.[314] Music 
broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC.[315] The Canadian 
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry 
awards, the Juno Awards, which were first awarded in 1970.[316] The Canadian 
Music Hall of Fame established in 1976 honours Canadian musicians for their 
lifetime achievements.[317] Patriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 
years as a distinct category from British patriotism, preceding the first 
legal steps to independence by over 50 years. The earliest, The Bold Canadian, 
was written in 1812.[318] The national anthem of Canada, "O Canada", was 
originally commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, the Honourable 
Théodore Robitaille, for the 1880 St. Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony, and was 
officially adopted in 1980.[319] Calixa Lavallée wrote the music, which 
was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile 
Routhier. The text was originally only in French, before it was translated 
to English in 1906.[320] The roots of organized sports in Canada date back 
to the 1770s.[321] Canada's official national sports are ice hockey and 
lacrosse.[322] Seven of Canada's eight largest metropolitan areas – Toronto, 
Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg – have franchises 
in the National Hockey League (NHL) while Quebec City had the Quebec Nordiques 
until they relocated to Colorado in 1995. Canada does have one Major League 
Baseball team, the Toronto Blue Jays, one professional basketball team, 
the Toronto Raptors, three Major League Soccer teams and four National 
Lacrosse League teams. Canada has participated in almost every Olympic 
Games since its Olympic debut in 1900, and has hosted several high-profile 
international sporting events, including the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, 
the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, the 1994 Basketball World Championship, 
the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and 
Whistler, British Columbia and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.[323] Other 
popular and professional spectator sports in Canada include curling, Canadian 
football and rugby league; the latter is played professionally in the Canadian 
Football League (CFL) and League 1 (Toronto Wolfpack). Golf, tennis, baseball, 
skiing, cricket, volleyball, rugby union, Australian Rules Football, soccer 
and basketball are widely played at youth and amateur levels, but professional 
leagues and franchises are not widespread. History Geography and climate
