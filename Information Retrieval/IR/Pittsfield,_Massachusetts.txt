Pittsfield is the largest city and the county seat of Berkshire County,[1] 
Massachusetts, United States. It is the principal city of the Pittsfield, 
Massachusetts Metropolitan Statistical Area which encompasses all of Berkshire 
County. The population was 44,737 at the 2010 census.[2] Although the population 
has declined in recent decades, Pittsfield remains the third largest municipality 
in western Massachusetts, behind only Springfield and Chicopee. In 2005, 
Farmers Insurance ranked Pittsfield 20th in the United States as "Most 
Secure Place To Live" among small towns with fewer than 150,000 residents.[3] 
In 2006, Forbes ranked Pittsfield as number 61 in its list of Best Small 
Places for Business.[4] In 2008, Country Home magazine ranked Pittsfield 
as #24 in a listing of "green cities" east of the Mississippi.[5] In 2009, 
the City of Pittsfield was chosen to receive a 2009 Commonwealth Award, 
Massachusetts' highest award in the arts, humanities, and sciences.[6] 
In 2010, the Financial Times proclaimed Pittsfield the "Brooklyn of the 
Berkshires", in an article covering its recent renaissance.[7] In 2012, 
the city was listed among the 10 best places for single people to retire 
in the U.S. by U.S. News, due to the high number of single older residents 
and higher likelihood of finding companionship or a partner.[8] The Mahican 
(Muh-hi-kann) Native American nation, an Algonquian people, inhabited Pittsfield 
and the surrounding area until the early 1700s, when, the population greatly 
reduced by war and disease, many migrated westward or lived quietly on 
the fringes of society.[9] In 1738, a wealthy Bostonian named Col. Jacob 
Wendell bought 24,000 acres (97 km2) of lands known originally as Pontoosuck, 
a Mohican word meaning "a field or haven for winter deer", as a speculative 
investment. He planned to subdivide and resell to others who would settle 
there. He formed a partnership with Philip Livingston, a wealthy kinsman 
from Albany, New York, and Col. John Stoddard of Northampton, who already 
had claim to 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) here. A group of young men came and 
began to clear the land in 1743, but the threat of Indian raids around 
the time of King George's War soon forced them to leave, and the land remained 
unoccupied by Englishmen for several more years. Soon, many others arrived 
from Westfield, Massachusetts, and a village began to grow, which was incorporated 
as Pontoosuck Plantation in 1753 by Solomon Deming, Simeon Crofoot, Stephen 
Crofoot, Charles Goodrich, Jacob Ensign, Samuel Taylor, and Elias Woodward. 
Mrs. Deming was both the first and the last of the original settlers, dying 
in March 1818 at the age of 92. Solomon Deming died in 1815 at the age 
of 96.[10] Pittsfield was incorporated in 1761. Royal Governor Sir Francis 
Bernard named Pittsfield after British nobleman and politician William 
Pitt.[11] By 1761 there were 200 residents, and the plantation became the 
Township of Pittsfield. By the end of the Revolutionary War, Pittsfield 
had expanded to nearly 2,000 residents, including Colonel John Brown, who 
began accusing Benedict Arnold as a traitor in 1776, several years before 
Arnold defected to the British. Brown wrote in his winter 1776-77 handbill, 
"Money is this man's God, and to get enough of it he would sacrifice his 
country."[12] Pittsfield was primarily an agricultural area, because of 
the many brooks that flowed into the Housatonic River; the landscape was 
also dotted with mills that produced lumber, grist, paper, and textiles. 
With the introduction of Merino sheep from Spain in 1807, the area became 
the center of woolen manufacturing in the United States, an industry that 
would dominate the community's economy for almost a century.[13] The town 
was a bustling metropolis by the late 19th century. In 1891, the City of 
Pittsfield was incorporated, and William Stanley, Jr., who had recently 
relocated his Electric Manufacturing Company to Pittsfield from Great Barrington, 
produced the first electric transformer. Stanley's enterprise was the forerunner 
of the internationally known corporate giant, General Electric (GE). Thanks 
to the success of GE, Pittsfield's population in 1930 had grown to more 
than 50,000. While GE Advanced Materials (now owned by SABIC-Innovative 
Plastics, a subsidiary of the Riyadh-based Saudi Basic Industries Corporation) 
continues to be one of the city's largest employers, a workforce that once 
topped 13,000 was reduced to less than 700 with the demise and/or relocation 
of the transformer and aerospace portions of the General Electric empire. 
On October 8, 2015, SABIC announced it would be relocating its headquarters 
from Pittsfield to Houston, Texas. [14] General Dynamics occupies many 
of the old GE buildings, and its workforce is expanding. Much of General 
Dynamics' local success is based on the awarding of government contracts 
relating to its advanced information systems.[citation needed] On September 
3, 1902, at 10:15 AM, during a two-week tour through New England campaigning 
for Republican congressmen, the barouche transporting President Theodore 
Roosevelt from downtown Pittsfield to the Pittsfield Country Club (see 
historic photos above) collided head-on with a trolley. Roosevelt, Massachusetts 
Governor Winthrop Murray Crane, secretary to the president George Bruce 
Cortelyou, and bodyguard William Craig were thrown into the street. Craig 
was killed; he was the first Secret Service agent killed while on a presidential 
protection detail. Roosevelt, whose face and left shin were badly bruised, 
nearly came to blows with the trolley motorman, Euclid Madden. Madden was 
later charged with manslaughter, to which he pleaded guilty. He was sentenced 
to six months in jail and a heavy fine. In 2004, historian John Thorn discovered 
a reference to a 1791 by-law prohibiting anyone from playing "baseball" 
within 80 yards (73 m) of the new meeting house in Pittsfield. A reference 
librarian, AnnMarie Harris, found the actual by-law in the Berkshire Athenaeum 
library, and its age was verified by researchers at the Williamstown Art 
Conservation Center. If authentic and if actually referring to a recognizable 
version of the modern game, the 1791 document, would be, as of 2004, the 
earliest known reference to the game in America. (See Origins of baseball.) 
The document is available on the Pittsfield Library's web site.[15] The 
so-called Broken Window By-Law is the earliest known reference to "baseball" 
in North America. A finding that baseball was invented in 1839 by Abner 
Doubleday in Cooperstown provided the rationale for baseball centennial 
celebrations in 1939, including the opening of a National Baseball Hall 
of Fame and Museum in that city. Few historians ever believed it, and even 
the Hall's vice president, Jeff Idelson, has stated that "Baseball wasn't 
really born anywhere."[16] In 1859, the first intercollegiate baseball 
game was played in Pittsfield. Amherst defeated Williams College 73-32.[17] 
Professional baseball was played in Pittsfield's Wahconah Park from 1919 
through 2003. Teams included the Pittsfield Electrics of the 1940s, the 
Pittsfield Red Sox from 1965-69 with such then A-league players and future 
major leaguers as George Scott, Carlton Fisk, and Reggie Smith, the Pittsfield 
Senators (later Rangers) of the 1970s, and the 1985-88 AA Pittsfield Cubs 
featuring future stars Mark Grace and Rafael Palmeiro. From 1989 to 2001, 
the Pittsfield Mets and Pittsfield Astros (2001 only) represented the city 
in the New York–Penn League. The Astros have since moved to Troy, New York, 
and are now known as the Tri-City ValleyCats. In 2005, Wahconah Park became 
the home stadium of the Pittsfield Dukes, a summer collegiate baseball 
franchise of the New England Collegiate Baseball League owned by Dan Duquette, 
former Boston Red Sox general manager. The Dukes had played the 2004 season 
in Hinsdale, Massachusetts, as the Berkshire Dukes. In 2009, the franchise 
changed its name to the Pittsfield American Defenders. The American Defenders 
name refers to both the United States military and a line of baseball gloves 
produced by Nocona Athletic Goods Company. Duquette's ownership group also 
owned the American Defenders of New Hampshire, members of the independent 
Can-Am League. Ulysses Frank Grant, born August 1, 1865, in Pittsfield 
(died May 27, 1937), was an African American baseball player in the 19th 
century, who played in the International League and for various independent 
teams. Mark Belanger, eight-time Gold Glove winning shortstop for the Baltimore 
Orioles, Turk Wendell, relief pitcher for the New York Mets, and Tom Grieve, 
outfielder for the Texas Rangers, were all from Pittsfield. Pittsfield 
is located at 42°27′N 73°15′W﻿ / ﻿42.450°N 73.250°W﻿ / 42.450; -73.250 
(42.4522, -73.2515).[18] According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the city has a total area of 42.5 square miles (110.0 km2), of which 40.5 
square miles (104.8 km2) is land and 2.0 square miles (5.2 km2), or 4.70%, 
is water.[2] Pittsfield is bordered by Lanesborough to the north, Dalton 
to the east, Washington to the southeast, Lenox to the south, Richmond 
to the southwest, and Hancock to the west. Pittsfield is located 48 miles 
(77 km) northwest of Springfield, 135 miles (217 km) west of Boston, and 
39 miles (63 km) east of Albany, New York. Most of the population occupies 
roughly one-quarter of the city's land. Pittsfield lies at the confluence 
of the east and west branches of the Housatonic River, which flows south 
from the city towards its mouth at Long Island Sound, some 149 miles (240 km) 
distant. The eastern branch leads down from the hills, while the western 
branch is fed from Onota Lake and Pontoosuc Lake (which lies partly in 
Lanesborough). Like much of western Berkshire County, the city lies between 
the Berkshire Hills to the east and the Taconic Range to the west. Sections 
of the Housatonic Valley Wildlife Management Area dot the banks of the 
river. The western portion of the city contains Pittsfield State Forest, 
an 11,000-acre (45,000,000 m2) facility with hiking and cross-country skiing 
trails, camping, picnic areas, and a beach for swimming.[19][20] Pittsfield 
is located at the crossroads of U.S. Route 7 and U.S. Route 20 which join 
together in the city. Massachusetts Route 8 passes through the northeast 
corner of town, with a portion of it combined with Route 9, the central 
east-west road through the western part of the state, whose western terminus 
is in the city at Route 7. Route 41 begins in the southwest corner of town, 
heading south from Route 20. The nearest interstate highway, Interstate 
90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike) is located about 10 miles (16 km) south 
in Lee. Long-distance ground transportation in Pittsfield is based at the 
Joseph Scelsi Intermodal Transportation Center which serves as the station 
for Amtrak trains and Peter Pan buses. The Berkshire Regional Transit Authority 
(BRTA), the transit provider for Pittsfield and vicinity, is based at the 
Intermodal Center and also uses it as a hub for most of its lines. Rail 
freight transportation is provided by CSX Transportation and the Housatonic 
Railroad. The FBO located at Pittsfield Municipal Airport offers access 
to the region via private and chartered aircraft ranging from single-engine 
piston to multi-engine jet. They also offer scenic rides and flight training. 
The nearest airport with national service is Albany International Airport. 
Pittsfield's climate is continental. Winters are harsh, with an average 
annual snowfall of 73.7 inches (1,870 mm) and temperatures dipping to 0 °F 
(−18 °C) or colder 13 times per year. Summers, however, are typically warm 
and pleasant, with temperatures reaching the 90s (32 to 37 °C) just six 
times per year. The record high and record low are 101 °F (38 °C) and −26 °F 
(−32 °C), recorded on July 23, 1926 and February 15, 1943, respectively. 
Over the course of a year, there are 140 days with measurable precipitation. 
September and October are the driest months, each with an average of nine 
days of precipitation. Flowing through a historically rural area,[22] the 
Housatonic River attracted increased industrialization in the late 19th 
century. William Stanley, Jr., founded the Stanley Electric Manufacturing 
Company in 1890 at Pittsfield. The company manufactured small transformers, 
electrical motors and appliances. In 1903, GE acquired Stanley Electric 
and subsequently operated three major manufacturing operations in Pittsfield: 
transformer, ordnance, and plastics.[23] During the mid-20th century, the 
Housatonic River and its floodplain were contaminated with polychlorinated 
biphenyls (PCBs) and other hazardous substances released from the General 
Electric Company (GE) facility located in Pittsfield. The contaminated 
area, known as the General Electric/Housatonic River Site, includes the 
GE manufacturing facility; the Housatonic River, its riverbanks and floodplains 
from Pittsfield to Long Island Sound, and former river oxbows that have 
been filled; Allendale School; Silver Lake; and other areas contaminated 
as a result of GE's operations in Pittsfield.[24] The highest concentrations 
of PCBs in the Housatonic River are found from the site of the GE plant 
in Pittsfield to Woods Pond in Lenox, Massachusetts, where they have been 
measured up to 140 mg/kg (140 ppm).[25] About 50% of all the PCBs currently 
in the river are estimated to be retained in the sediment behind Woods 
Pond dam. This is estimated to be about 11,000 pounds of PCBs.[25] Birds 
and fish who live in and around the river contain significant levels of 
PCBs.[26] Starting in 1991, legal proceedings by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) established the General Electric/Housatonic River 
Site. Initial cleanup work began in 1996 when EPA issued a unilateral order 
to GE that required the removal of highly contaminated sediments and bank 
soils. EPA added the site to the Superfund list in September 1997. The 
year 1999 was a milestone for Pittsfield, when negotiations between EPA, 
the state, General Electric and the City resulted in a settlement agreement 
– valued at over $250 million – to clean up Pittsfield and the Housatonic 
River. The settlement was memorialized in a consent decree that was entered 
in federal court the following year, making it a binding legal agreement.[27] 
In the years since the settlement was reached, the EPA, state agencies, 
the City and GE accomplished one of the largest and most complex cleanups 
in the country. Cleanup work on the first previously PCB-laden half mile 
of the Housatonic River, adjacent to the GE facility, was completed in 
September 2002.[24] $90 million was spent cleaning up the 1.5-mile (2.4 km) 
reach between Lyman Street and Fred Garner Park, which was completed in 
June 2007. Biological and sediment samples showed reductions of approximately 
99% of PCB concentrations compared to conditions before remediation.[24] 
GE removed contaminated soil and restored 27 residential properties abutting 
the river. To date, more than 115,000 cubic yards (88,000 m3) of PCB-contaminated 
sediment, bank, and floodplain soil have been removed from the river and 
residential property.[28] As of the census[41] of 2000, there were 45,793 
people, 19,704 households, and 11,822 families residing in the city. Pittsfield 
is the largest city by population in Berkshire County, and ranks 27th out 
of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts. The population density was 
1,124.3 people per square mile (434.1/km²), making it the most densely 
populated community in county and 92nd overall in the Commonwealth. There 
were 21,366 housing units at an average density of 524.6 per square mile 
(202.5/km²). The racial makeup of the city in 2010 was 86.9% White, 4.99% 
African American, 0.14% Native American, 1.16% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 
0.77% from other races, and 1.64% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino 
of any race were 5.04% of the population. Major ancestry groups reported 
by Pittsfield residents include: Irish 20%, Italian 17%, French 11%, English

Puerto Rican 3%, Scottish 2%, Dutch 2%, Scotch-Irish 1%, Russian 1%, Greek 
1%, Ukrainian 1%, Lebanese 1%, Portuguese 1%, Asian Indian 1%, Swedish 
1%. There were 19,704 households out of which 27.3% had children under 
the age of 18 living with them, 42.9% were married couples living together, 
13.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 40.0% were 
non-families. 34.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 14.3% 
had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average 
household size was 2.26 and the average family size was 2.89. In the city 
the population was spread out with 23.2% under the age of 18, 6.9% from 
18 to 24, 28.3% from 25 to 44, 23.0% from 45 to 64, and 18.6% who were 
65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females 
there were 90.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 
86.2 males. The median income for a household in the city was $35,655, 
and the median income for a family was $46,228. Males had a median income 
of $35,538 versus $26,341 for females. The per capita income for the city 
was $20,549. About 8.9% of families and 11.4% of the population were below 
the poverty line, including 16.7% of those under age 18 and 7.1% of those 
age 65 or over. Pittsfield employs the mayor-council form of government. 
The current mayor is Linda Tyer, who was elected for Pittsfield's first 
four-year term in January 2016,[42] succeeding Daniel Bianchi, who served 
the city since January 2012. The city is fully functioning, with all the 
major public services, including Berkshire Medical Center which is the 
only hospital in the northern part of the county, and the region's only 
VA medical clinic. The city's library, the Berkshire Athenaeum, is one 
of the largest in western Massachusetts, and is connected to the regional 
library system. Pittsfield is also the county seat of Berkshire County, 
and as such has many state facilities for the county. In 2011, the City 
of Pittsfield received 129 designs of prospective official flags from residents 
in honor of the 250th anniversary of Pittsfield's incorporation as a town, 
with the winning design submitted by Shaun Harris.[43] On the state level, 
Pittsfield has two representatives to the Massachusetts House of Representatives: 
the Third Berkshire District, which covers most of the city proper and 
is represented by Tricia Farley-Bouvier and the Second Berkshire District, 
which serves portions of Berkshire County as well as portions of Hampshire 
County and Franklin County, represented by Paul Mark. In the Massachusetts 
Senate, the city is represented by the Berkshire, Hampshire and Franklin 
district, which includes all of Berkshire County and western Hampshire 
and Franklin counties and is represented by Benjamin Downing.[44] The city 
is patrolled by the Fourth (Cheshire) Station of Barracks "B" of the Massachusetts 
State Police.[45] On the national level, Pittsfield is represented in the 
United States House of Representatives as part of Massachusetts's 1st congressional 
district, and has been represented by Richard Neal of Springfield since 
2013. Massachusetts is represented in the United States Senate by senior 
Senator Elizabeth Warren (D) and junior Senator Ed Markey (D). Pittsfield 
operates a public school system which has over 6,000 students. There are 
eight elementary schools (Allendale, Robert T. Capeless, Crosby, Egremont, 
Morningside, Silvio O. Conte, Stearns and Williams), two middle schools 
(Theodore Herberg and John T. Reid), and two high schools (Pittsfield High 
School and Taconic High School). The high schools both offer internal vocational 
programs. Students also come to the high schools from neighboring Richmond. 
There are two parochial schools (Saint Mark's for elementary and middle 
school students, and St. Joseph Central High School for high school students) 
and one private school, Miss Hall's School. Pittsfield is the home to the 
main campus of Berkshire Community College and Mildred Elley's Pittsfield 
campus. The nearest state college is the Massachusetts College of Liberal 
Arts in North Adams, and the nearest state university is Westfield State 
University. The nearest private colleges are Williams College in Williamstown 
and Bard College at Simon's Rock in Great Barrington. Pittsfield is the 
geographic and commercial hub of the Berkshires—a historic area that includes 
Tanglewood, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and author 
Edith Wharton's estate The Mount. Many buildings in Pittsfield are listed 
on the National Register of Historic Places. Downtown Pittsfield is home 
to the gilded-age Colonial Theatre, the Berkshire Museum, the Beacon Cinema 
(multi-plex), the Barrington Stage Company, Berkshire Athenaeum, Wahconah 
Park and Hebert Arboretum. In recent years, the city has undergone a transformation 
with significant investment in the historic downtown, including a variety 
of new restaurants (French, Japanese, Sushi, Mexican, American, etc.), 
condominium and other residential developments and cultural attractions. 
The Colonial Theatre, dating from 1903, was named by Hillary Clinton as 
a National Historic Treasure in 1998. The community invested more than 
$22 million to refurbish the 100-year-old Colonial Theatre, one of the 
only theaters of its kind from the Vaudeville age. The venue has been described 
as the "one of the finest acoustical theaters in the world." Barrington 
Stage Company, the Tony Award-winning producer of The 25th Annual Putnam 
County Spelling Bee invested millions into its newly renovated stage in 
downtown Pittsfield, along with the development of other stages within 
the downtown for smaller performances. Barrington Stage's head of its Musical 
Theatre Lab, William Finn, told the Boston Globe that he was determined 
to make Pittsfield the "epicenter of the musical theater universe." The 
Berkshire Museum, the oldest and most diverse museum in the Berkshires, 
has undergone a multi-million dollar renovation that incorporated a state-of-the-art 
air control system that will allow it to attract world-class exhibits. 
Many of the Berkshires' oldest homes, dating to the mid-18th century, can 
be found in Pittsfield, as well as many historic neighborhoods dating from 
the late 19th century and early 20th century.[47] Several small multi-generational 
farms can still be found in Pittsfield, though suburban sprawl and land 
development have recently claimed some of this land. Additional cultural 
attractions include: Pittsfield has several country clubs, including the 
Pontoosuc Lake Country Club. Pittsfield is home to two lakes, Onota and 
Pontoosuc, both popular for swimming, boating, and fishing. The Berkshire 
Rowing and Sculling Society is located on Onota Lake. Pittsfield is home 
to Canoe Meadows Wildlife Sanctuary, 264 acres (107 ha) of woods, fields, 
and wetlands maintained by the Massachusetts Audubon Society. Bousquet 
Ski Area and Summer Resort entertains visitors and residents year-round 
with skiing, water slides, go-karts, and other fun activities. Pittsfield 
State Forest, an 11,000-acre (4,500 ha) park, provides residents and tourists 
with hiking and cross-country skiing trails, camping, picnic areas, and 
a swimming beach. The highest body of water in Massachusetts, Berry Pond, 
is located at the top of the Pittsfield State Forest just outside the city 
limits in the town of Hancock.[20] The Berkshire Bike Path Council is working 
with the City of Pittsfield and local residents to extend the Ashuwillticook 
Rail Trail, a popular 10.8-mile (17.4 km) paved trail located just north 
of Pittsfield. The extension would pass through Pittsfield and lead south 
to Lenox and Great Barrington. Pittsfield is served by Amtrak's Lake Shore 
Limited from Chicago to Boston. Local transit is provided by the Berkshire 
Regional Transit Authority.[48][49] Commuter bus service is provided by 
Peter Pan Bus Lines Pittsfield is located in the Albany television market 
and is the community of license for two stations in that market, MyNetworkTV 
affiliate WNYA, and a low power TV station, W28DA, which rebroadcasts sister 
station and NBC affiliate WNYT on channel 13 from a location on South Mountain 
in the city. Springfield stations also serve the market with three stations 
(NBC affiliate WWLP, low-powered CBS affiliate WSHM-LD, and PBS member 
station WGBY-TV) on cable. WGGB-TV, Springfield's ABC affiliate, has never 
been carried on the cable system in Pittsfield, but is viewable over the 
air in some sections. Also carried on cable, but not necessarily serving 
Pittsfield, is Boston's WCVB (the ABC affiliate in that area). Cable television 
subscribers of Time Warner Cable (TWC) in Pittsfield receive public, educational, 
and government access (PEG) channels, provided by Pittsfield Community 
Television (PCTV), on channels 16, 17 and 18: Pittsfield Community Television 
is a not-for-profit, 501 (c)(3) organization and a member of the Alliance 
for Community Media. Programming on PCTV is available 24 hours per day, 
year-long, and is available online. Pittsfield is home to the following 
radio stations: Signals from North Adams, Great Barrington, and Springfield, 
Massachusetts, as well as from Albany, New York, also reach Pittsfield. 
In some areas signals from cities well outside of Pittsfield, like Boston 
and Hartford, Connecticut, will be received, depending on the location. 
One of Pittsfield's oldest radio stations, WBEC-FM 105.5, was sold and 
relocated to Mount Tom in Holyoke, where it became a Springfield radio 
station (technically licensed to Easthampton). The move changed over two 
decades of programming on the Pittsfield dial which moved WBEC-FM as a 
Top 40 station on 105.5 down to 95.9, WUPE (as oldies) up to 100.1 in North 
Adams, replacing the Beautiful/EZ format on 100.1 known as WMNB. Pittsfield
