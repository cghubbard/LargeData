The 1963 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 82nd season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and its 72nd season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
93–69 (.574) during the season, and finished 2nd in the National League, 
six games behind the eventual World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers. 
The season was Stan Musial's 22nd and final season with the team, and in 
MLB. Future Hall of Famer Stan Musial played his final game on September 
29, a 3–2 victory in 14 innings against the visiting Cincinnati Reds. All 
four starting infielders in the 1963 All-Star Game were Cardinals. Ken 
Boyer (3B), Dick Groat (SS), and Bill White (1B) were elected, and Julián 
Javier (2B) took over for the elected but injured Bill Mazeroski of Pittsburgh.[6] 
Pitcher Bobby Shantz, first baseman Bill White, third baseman Ken Boyer, 
and outfielder Curt Flood won Gold Gloves this year.[7] Infielders Other
