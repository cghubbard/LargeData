James Evan Perry, Jr. (born October 30, 1935) is an American former Major 
League Baseball pitcher. He pitched from 1959–1975 for four different teams. 
During a 17-year baseball career, Perry compiled 215 wins, 1,576 strikeouts, 
and a 3.45 earned run average. He was born in Williamston, North Carolina 
and attended Campbell University until being signed by the Indians in 1956. 
He is the older brother of Hall of Fame pitcher Gaylord Perry and was a 
fine pitcher in his own right. The Perry brothers trail only the Niekro 
brothers (Phil and Joe) for career victories by brothers. In 1959, Jim 
Perry came in 2nd to Bob Allison in the Rookie of the Year vote. Perry 
followed up with an 18-win season in 1960. Perry was a three-time All-Star 
and won the 1970 AL Cy Young Award, when he posted a record of 24-12. Jim 
and Gaylord Perry are the only brothers in Major League history to win 
Cy Young Awards. He also won 20 games in 1969, and won at least 17 games 
five times. As a batter, Perry was a switch-hitter and posted a respectable 
.199 batting average in his career. On July 3, 1973, brothers Gaylord Perry 
(Indians) and Jim Perry (Tigers) pitched against each other for the only 
regular season game in their careers. Neither finished the game, but Gaylord 
was charged with the 5–4 loss. Two Norm Cash home runs helped Detroit. 
He is currently tied with Stan Coveleski for 84th on the all-time win list. 
Following his final year with Oakland, Perry retired to his North Carolina 
home where he keeps busy with charitable events, especially golf tournaments. 
His son, Chris, is a professional golfer who has won a tournament on the 
PGA Tour. On June 11, 2011, Perry was inducted into the Twins Hall of Fame 
in a ceremony prior to a Twins home game and attended by current members 
including Rod Carew, Bert Blyleven, Rick Aguilera, Gary Gaetti, Tom Kelly, 
Jim Rantz, and Tony Oliva.[1] On November 11, 2012, Campbell University 
announced that their new baseball stadium would be named, Jim Perry Stadium.
