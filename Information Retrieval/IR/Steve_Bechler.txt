Steven Scott Bechler (November 18, 1979 – February 17, 2003) was an American 
professional baseball player. A pitcher, Bechler played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles. After starring for the South 
Medford High School baseball team, the Orioles selected Bechler in the 
third round of the 1998 MLB draft. Following five seasons in Minor League 
Baseball, Bechler made his major league debut with the Orioles in 2002. 
Attending spring training in 2003, he died of heat stroke while participating 
in conditioning drills. A medical examiner found that Bechler's use of 
ephedra as a weight-loss supplement contributed to his death. Following 
this revelation, the Food and Drug Administration opened an inquiry, which 
resulted in the banning of ephedra products in the United States. Bechler 
was born on November 18, 1979, in Medford, Oregon, to Ernest and Patricia 
Bechler. He had three brothers.[1] At the age of seven, he began playing 
baseball.[2] As a youth, he competed in the Medford American Little League, 
Babe Ruth League, and American Legion Baseball.[1] He was a member of the 
1997 American Legion World Series champions.[3] Bechler suffered from asthma 
as a child, and endured heatstrokes while in high school.[4] Bechler attended 
South Medford High School in Medford, Oregon. He graduated in 1998.[1] 
Playing for the school's baseball team, he was named to the All-Oregon 
third team in his senior year.[5] Heading into the 1998 Major League Baseball 
draft, Baseball America rated Bechler the best high school prospect from 
the state of Oregon.[6] The Baltimore Orioles selected him in the third 
round draft.[3] Bechler signed with the Orioles, receiving a $257,000 signing 
bonus. He made his professional debut in Minor League Baseball with the 
Gulf Coast Orioles of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League that year.[7] 
He pitched for the Delmarva Shorebirds of the Class A South Atlantic League 
in 1999, and for the Frederick Keys of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League 
in 2000.[8] In 2001, he pitched for Frederick, and was named a Carolina 
League All-Star. He did not appear in the All-Star Game, as he was promoted 
to the Rochester Red Wings of the Class AAA International League.[9] After 
struggling in two outings for Rochester, he was demoted to the Bowie Baysox 
of the Class AA Eastern League, where he remained for the rest of the season. 
After the 2001 season, the Orioles assigned Bechler to the Maryvale Saguaros 
of the Arizona Fall League.[10] The Orioles added Bechler to their 40-man 
roster to protect him from being eligible in the Rule 5 draft.[11] In 2002, 
Bechler pitched for Bowie and Rochester. He had a 2–1 win–loss record with 
a 3.42 earned run average (ERA) with Bowie and 6–11 record and a 4.09 ERA 
with Rochester.[12] At the end of the minor league season, the Orioles 
promoted Bechler to the major leagues.[3][12] He appeared in three games 
for the Orioles, pitching 4 2⁄3 innings, in which he allowed six hits, 
four walks, three home runs, and recorded three strikeouts.[13] He suffered 
a strained hamstring in his final appearance.[14] On October 22, 2002, 
Bechler married Kiley Mae Nixon at Community Bible Church in Central Point, 
Oregon.[1] The couple was expecting a child at the time of his death.[3] 
His daughter, Hailie, was born in April 2003.[2][15] On February 16, 2003, 
towards the beginning of Orioles' spring training camp in Fort Lauderdale, 
Florida, Bechler collapsed while participating in conditioning drills. 
He was rushed to a nearby hospital, and died the next day.[16] His body 
temperature had reached 108 °F (42 °C).[17] An autopsy performed by Dr. 
Joshua Perper, a toxicologist serving as the medical examiner for Broward 
County, concluded that his death was caused by "'abnormal liver function 
and mild hypertension', his weight problem (he weighed 230 pounds and was 
exercising hard[18]), the fact that he was not used to south Florida's 
warm weather and the toxicity of ephedra.[19] He was using the supplement 
ephedra, against the advice of his trainer,[20] and probably had not eaten 
in two days in an effort to lose weight.[21] At the time of Bechler's death, 
ephedra was banned by the International Olympic Committee, the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association, and the National Football League, but 
not by Major League Baseball.[4] Bud Selig, the Commissioner of Baseball, 
called for a ban of ephedrine in the wake of Bechler's death.[22] Numerous 
teams banned the use of ephedra in team clubhouses.[23] Following Bechler's 
death, the Food and Drug Administration, which had previously chosen not 
to ban ephedra, re-opened its efforts to regulate ephedra use. The United 
States Congress dropped its objections to banning ephedra, and Bechler's 
parents testified in front of Congress.[17] The FDA announced its decision 
to ban ephedra on December 30.[24] Bechler was cremated following his death. 
On the six month anniversary of his death, Kiley scattered his ashes on 
the pitcher's mound of Oriole Park at Camden Yards.[15] She filed a wrongful 
death claim against Nutraquest, the manufacturers of the supplement, seeking 
$600 million in damages.[25][26] The lawsuit against Nutraquest was suspended 
in October 2003 when the company filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 
of the United States Code.[27] The Steve Bechler Scholarship Fund was begun 
by Bechler's parents in his memory. The fund receives money from South 
Medford businesses to help South Medford High School graduates afford college.[28]
