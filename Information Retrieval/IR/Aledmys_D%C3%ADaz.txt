Aledmys Díaz Serrano (born August 1, 1990) is a Cuban professional baseball 
shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB), who 
signed him as a free agent in 2014. Díaz made his major league debut for 
the Cardinals in 2016 and was named an All-Star that year. He previously 
played for the Naranjas de Villa Clara in the Cuban National Series from 
2007 through 2012 before defecting to play in the United States. While 
growing up in Santa Clara, Cuba, Aledmys Díaz lived on the same street 
as, and was friends with, future Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher José 
Fernández. They played for the same youth baseball team, and Díaz' father 
and uncle encouraged Fernández' mother to bring him to the ballpark. Fernández 
commented that had Diaz' uncle not been an influence early in his life, 
he would not have pursued a professional baseball career.[1][2] Díaz played 
in the Serie Nacional de Béisbol (Cuban National Series), the primary amateur 
baseball competition in Cuba, for the Naranjas de Villa Clara, based in 
Santa Clara. He debuted in the 2007–08 season by going nine for 32 in a 
utility role. At age 19 in 2008–09, Díaz batted .301 with a .403 on-base 
percentage (OBP) and .482 slugging percentage (SLG) but fielded only .930 
as a regular infielder. He was third in the Serie Nacional with 24 errors. 
The next season, Díaz batted .282 with a .348 OBP, .363 SLG and fielded 
.950 as Villa Clara's starting shortstop. He tied for fifth in the Serie 
Nacional with 18 errors, having improved his defense. During his 2011–12 
season, Díaz' offensive production continued to climb, as he batted .315 
with a .404 OBP and .500 SLG. He hit 12 home runs in 270 at bats.[3][4] 
From 2008 to 2012, Díaz, batted .308 with a .401 OBP and .444 SLG.[4] Díaz 
defected from Cuba in 2012 while playing with the Cuban national baseball 
team in a tournament in the Netherlands.[5] He was declared ineligible 
to sign with any MLB teams until February 19, 2014, due to lying about 
his age.[6] He spent the interim 18 months from defecting from Cuba playing 
in Mexico City.[7] To audition for a contract with MLB clubs, Díaz held 
a showcase with fellow Cuban defector Odrisamer Despaigne on February 13, 
2014.[3] Although Díaz was initially projected to command a major league 
contract with a similar level of pay to other Cuban defectors such as Alex 
Guerrero and Erisbel Arruebarrena, his performance in the showcase did 
not leave the impression that he merited such a level of salary, and, further, 
many clubs passed on him altogether. He had left Mexico City effectively 
out of shape to play professional baseball.[7] He signed a four-year contract 
with the St. Louis Cardinals worth $8 million on March 9.[8] The Cardinals 
first assigned Díaz to the Palm Beach Cardinals of the Class A-Advanced 
Florida State League in 2014, and he was promoted to the Springfield Cardinals 
of the Class AA Texas League that season. While playing for Springfield, 
he battled injuries before he was designated for assignment on July 8, 
2015.[9] While he had benefited from talent alone while playing in Cuba, 
his lack of preparation had caused his performance to suffer after playing 
the minor leagues. However, he diligently began to prepare more and proactively 
ask more questions.[10] In the last 45 games of the 2015 season after his 
removal from the 40-man roster, Díaz batted .333, .404 OBP, and .574 SLG. 
The Cardinals reinstated him to the 40-man roster after the season.[9] 
Over the full 2015 campaign, Díaz batted .278, .339 OBP and .445 SLG.[11] 
He batted .239 against right-handed pitchers, .371 against left-handers, 
.329 in road games and .222 in home games.[12] He played in the Arizona 
Fall League following the regular season, registering a .616 SLG and .987 
OPS.[13] Originally planning for Díaz to spend the 2016 season in Memphis, 
the Cardinals eventually moved three veteran players to accommodate him 
becoming the starting shortstop.[14] On April 5, 2016, the Cardinals recalled 
him to the major league roster to take the place of outfielder Tommy Pham, 
who had departed on Opening Day two days earlier with an injury.[15] Díaz 
debuted on the same day as his call-up. In his first major league at bat 
in the third inning against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he singled off Jon 
Niese for his first hit in a 6–5 loss.[16] Initially, Díaz' presence on 
the roster gave the Cardinals a capable hitter with upside who could play 
shortstop[7] and fill a void until the return of Rubén Tejada, who had 
injured himself late in spring training. Tejada himself was a replacement 
signed as a free agent during spring training to replace the already-established 
starting shortstop Jhonny Peralta, who also had injured himself and was 
projected to be unable to play significantly longer than Tejada.[17] On 
April 8, Díaz' first major league home run contributed to the Cardinals 
becoming the first team in major league history to hit three pinch hit 
home runs in the same game. Jeremy Hazelbaker and Greg Garcia were the 
other pinch hitters as the Cardinals defeated the Atlanta Braves, 7–4. 
The previous record of two pinch hit home runs by the same team in one 
game was previously accomplished on 57 occasions, most recently in 2011.[18] 
Tejada was reinstated from the disabled list on April 18, However, Díaz' 
hitting had led the Cardinals to instead retain him as the starting shortstop, 
thus assigning Tejada to be a utility infielder.[19] In an 11–2 win over 
the San Diego Padres on April 23, Díaz garnered his first five-hit game.[20] 
After collecting two hits in his first two at bats in a game against the 
Arizona Diamondbacks on April 25 to give him 26 hits in 52 at bats, he 
became the first rookie in MLB since 1900 to carry at least a .500 batting 
average at any point after accumulating 50 at bats, per the Elias Sports 
Bureau.[21] Meanwhile, past defensive liabilities reemerged: in Díaz' first 
31 games of the season, he committed nine errors.[7] However, he garnered 
early attention for the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award; 
as of June 6, he was third in the NL in batting at .328 and had hit eight 
home runs and 30 RBI.[1][22] When Peralta returned from the disabled list 
on June 7, Díaz' sustained level of play convinced the Cardinals to displace 
Peralta to third base and third baseman Matt Carpenter to second base.[14] 
As the season progressed, Díaz' defense notably improved; in the remaining 
51 games leading up to the All-Star break, he committed six errors.[7] 
On July 7th, he was selected to his first MLB All-Star Game to replace 
Carpenter, who had been injured two days earlier.[23] Díaz appeared as 
a pinch hitter with the bases loaded against Will Harris in the eighth 
inning, and struck out looking as the American League defeated the National 
League, 4−2.[24] On July 21 against Padres in a 5−5 game, Díaz batted against 
Carlos Villanueva with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth inning 
and, this time, singled home the game-winning run for his first career 
walk-off hit.[25] After sustaining a hairline fracture of his thumb during 
a game against Miami, the Cardinals placed Díaz on the DL on August 1.[26] 
Diaz hit his first major league grand slam on September 27th, 2016, his 
first game back after the death of his childhood friend, Jose Fernandez. 
Diaz was called back out for a curtain call, where he rose his helmet high 
towards the sky. Diaz stated afterwards, "Every time I put on a uniform,
