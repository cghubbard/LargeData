The San Diego Padres were a minor league baseball team which played in 
the Pacific Coast League from 1936 through 1968. The team that would eventually 
become the Padres was well traveled prior to moving to San Diego. It began 
its existence in 1903 as the Sacramento Solons, a charter member of the 
PCL. The team moved to Tacoma in 1904 (where it won the PCL pennant), returned 
to Sacramento in 1905, then left the PCL altogether for the next three 
seasons. The Solons rejoined the PCL in 1909, then moved to San Francisco 
during the 1914 season, finishing out the season as the San Francisco Missions. 
The team was sold to businessman Bill "Hardpan" Lane, who moved the team 
to Salt Lake City for the 1915 season as the Salt Lake Bees. Eleven years 
later Lane moved the Bees to Los Angeles for the 1926 season, and changed 
their name to the Hollywood Stars. The Stars played at Wrigley Field, home 
of the Los Angeles Angels, winning pennants in 1929 and 1930. When, after 
the 1935 season, the Angels doubled the Stars' rent, Lane moved the Stars 
to San Diego for the 1936 season, to become the San Diego Padres. The city 
constructed a waterfront stadium for its new team, appropriately called 
Lane Field, replacing a race track that was on the site. The team finished 
second in its inaugural year in the border city, then won the postseason 
series and the PCL pennant in 1937, led by the hitting of sophomore outfielder 
Ted Williams, who was first signed to a contract in 1936. Though for the 
next decade or more the Padres were mired in the second division, at last 
this franchise achieved stability and longevity. The team remained in San 
Diego for 32 years, displaced only by virtue of San Diego's admission to 
the major leagues. In 1954, managed by former major league player Lefty 
O'Doul, the Padres finished first in the PCL for the first time in their 
history, but were eliminated in the postseason playoffs. After the 1957 
season, the Padres were sold to C. Arnholt Smith, who moved the team from 
ancient Lane Field to Westgate Park, an 8,200-seat facility located in 
what is now the Fashion Valley Mall of Mission Valley In 1960, Smith brought 
in Eddie Leishman as General Manager/President. Leishman, who had helped 
run the Yankee farm system throughout the previous 10 years, was brought 
in with the idea to bring the team to the Major Leagues. The Padres proceeded 
to win PCL pennants in 1962, 1964, and 1967. The Padres were the class 
AAA affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds from 1962–65; some of their players 
(including Tony Pérez) would become vital cogs of what was called the "Big 
Red Machine" Reds' teams of the 1970s. The Pads won a final PCL pennant 
in 1967 as a farm club of the Philadelphia Phillies. In 1967, Smith won 
a bid for an expansion team in the National League for the 1969 season. 
After the 1968 PCL season, he folded the team, and transferred the name 
of the club to his new NL team, the San Diego Padres. The Phillies would 
move their AAA affiliation to the Eugene Emeralds. The Padres, like most 
PCL clubs, operated without a working agreement with or outright ownership 
by a major league team throughout much of the 1930s and 1940s, and again 
in the mid-1950s when the PCL was an Open Classification league attempting 
to attain MLB status. They were affiliated with the following major league
