The sweet spot is a place where a combination of factors results in a maximum 
response for a given amount of effort. In tennis, squash, racquetball, 
baseball, cricket or golf a given swing will result in a more powerful 
hit if the ball strikes the racket, bat or club on the latter's sweet spot.

rebounds away from the racket, bat, club, etc. with a greater velocity 
than if struck at any other point on the racket, bat or club. In endurance 
sports such as cycling, sweet spot training aims to maximise training benefit 
(generally for performance at or near FTP, or Functional Threshold Power) 
by optimally balancing training effect, physiological strain and maximum
