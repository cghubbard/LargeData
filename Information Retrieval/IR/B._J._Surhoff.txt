William James "B. J." Surhoff (born August 4, 1964 in the Bronx, New York 
City) is a former catcher, outfielder, first baseman, third baseman, and 
designated hitter in Major League Baseball. Over his 18-year major league 
career, he played every position except pitcher. After playing for the 
Orioles from 1996 to 2000, he rejoined the team in 2003 and played through 
the 2005 season. He started his career with the Milwaukee Brewers (1987–1995) 
and also played for the Atlanta Braves (2000–2002). Surhoff began his career 
as a catcher, and after playing third base in the mid-1990s, shifted to 
become primarily a left fielder. Surhoff attended Rye High School in Westchester, 
New York and hit a monstrous home run as a visitor at Somers High School 
which cleared route 139 and hit the firehouse. The home run was dubbed 
"The Killer", and is infamous in high school baseball lore as it bounced 
off the firehouse and killed a small squirrel. The spot the home run landed 
is still marked. After high school he attended the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was honored as the 1985 ACC Male Athlete 
of the Year, and played on the very first (1984) U.S. Olympic baseball 
team. He was a two-time first team All-American at UNC and his career batting 
average of .392 was a school record until Dustin Ackley set the mark at 
.412 in 2009.[1] He was selected by the Brewers with the first overall 
pick of the 1985 amateur draft. Surhoff was a very versatile player, having 
appeared at every position except pitcher over the course of his career. 
He had 2,326 hits and 1,153 RBI in his career. Although always a consistent 
hitter, having hit over .280 in 12 of his 19 seasons, Surhoff's finest 
season was his 1999 campaign with the Orioles, in which he led the American 
League in at-bats (673), ranked second in hits (207), was selected to the 
American League All-Star team, and ultimately won Most Valuable Oriole 
honors for the season, becoming one of five players to get 200 or more 
hits in a season for the team. He also participated in the Home Run Derby. 
In other notable seasons, he finished sixth in the AL in doubles in 1993 
with the Brewers and finished fifth in batting average in the AL with the 
Brewers in 1995 with a .320 average. In 2007, Surhoff was elected to the 
Orioles Hall of Fame, with the official induction ceremony occurring before 
the start of the Orioles–Twins game on August 25, 2007, at Oriole Park 
at Camden Yards. His father Dick Surhoff played two years in the NBA in 
1952–1953 and 1953–1954 and his brother Rick Surhoff appeared in nine games 
in 1985 as a relief pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies and the Texas 
Rangers. He also has a brother named Mark who lives in Rye, New York. His 
son, Austin Surhoff, swam at the University of Texas and won the 200 individual 
medley and 200 backstroke at the 2010 Big 12 Championships.[2] Then he 
won the 200 Individual Medley national title a month later. Surhoff lives 
in Cockeysville, Maryland with his wife Polly and their four children. 
He is the president of Pathfinders for Autism, a Hunt Valley support group 
for families with autistic children. Surhoff's son, Mason, is autistic.[3] 
Surhoff is the uncle of former UNC third-team All-American pitcher Brian 
Moran, and current Houston Astros minor league third baseman Colin Moran.[4][5] 
In 2008, 2009 and 2012 Surhoff was a spring training instructor for the
