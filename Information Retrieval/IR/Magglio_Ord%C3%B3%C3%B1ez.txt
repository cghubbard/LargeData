Magglio José Ordóñez Delgado (/ɔːrˈdoʊnjɛz/; born January 28, 1974) is 
a retired Venezuelan Major League Baseball right fielder. He played for 
the Chicago White Sox (1997–2004) and Detroit Tigers (2005–2011). Ordóñez 
is 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and weighs 215 lb (98 kg). Ordóñez retired 
from major league baseball as a Tiger on June 3, 2012 in a ceremony at 
Comerica Park prior to the afternoon game. In 2013, he announced that he 
will be running for public office in his native country of Venezuela and 
was elected mayor of the Juan Antonio Sotillo Municipality on December 
8, 2013. In a 15-year major league career (through the end of the 2011 
season), Ordóñez was a .309 hitter with 294 home runs and 1,236 RBIs in 
1,848 games. He has been selected for the All-Star Game six times (1999–2001, 
2003, and 2006–07) and has won three Silver Slugger awards (2000, 2002, 
and 2007). In 2007, he won the American League batting title with an average 
of .363. He also established a career high with 139 runs batted in, and 
finished runner-up to Alex Rodriguez in the AL Most Valuable Player award 
voting. Ordóñez spent the first eight years of his major league career 
playing with the Chicago White Sox. In the five seasons prior to 2004, 
Ordóñez hit at least .300 with 29 home runs and 99 RBI, and reached the 
30-home run, 100-RBI plateau in four of those seasons. He also collected 
over 70 extra-base hits from 2001 to 2003, but a collision with second 
baseman Willie Harris on Omar Vizquel's popup to right field during a May 
19, 2004 game against the Cleveland Indians, cost him two trips to the 
disabled list and two surgeries on his left knee. He finished with .292, 
9 home runs, and 37 RBI in 52 games. During the 2001 season when Ordóñez 
was teammates with Jose Canseco, Canseco claims he injected Ordóñez with 
steroids.[1] During the 2003 off-season, Ordonez was almost traded to the 
Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox and Texas Rangers had been in discussions for 
weeks about Boston acquiring the reigning American League MVP, SS Alex 
Rodriguez for outfielder Manny Ramirez. The Red Sox then agreed in principle 
to trade its incumbent SS Nomar Garciaparra to the White Sox for Ordonez. 
When the Rodriguez-for-Ramirez trade fell through, the Red Sox decided 
to not trade Garciaparra and the Ordonez trade was called off as well.[2] 
Ordóñez signed with the Detroit Tigers as a free agent on February 7, 2005. 
His five-year, $85 million contract was the second largest the Tigers had 
ever paid a player. Because of Ordóñez's knee injury from the 2004 season, 
the contract included a clause stating that if he were to spend more than 
25 days on the disabled list due to the same injury, the contract could 
be bought out for $3 million at the discretion of the Tigers' management. 
After he signed with Detroit, a minor war of words occurred between Ordóñez 
and Ozzie Guillén, his former manager and teammate in Chicago.[3] Their 
apparent mutual dislike for each other was a contributing factor to Ordóñez's 
departure from the White Sox. However, the rivalry appears to have cooled, 
as Guillén actually requested Ordóñez for the 2006 All-Star Game. In 2005, 
Ordóñez's first season for Detroit, he strained an abdominal muscle during 
the first week of the season and spent the next three months on the disabled 
list, as the strain turned out to be a hernia. This caused him to rest 
after corrective surgery for two months following the injury, after which 
he began a rehabilitation assignment at the Tigers' AAA minor league team 
in Toledo. He returned to the Tigers' lineup in early July, and once again 
became a star by hitting consistently over .300 while batting clean-up. 
In 2006, Ordóñez returned to All-Star form. He was selected to the 2006 
All-Star game as an injury replacement for Red Sox Left Fielder Manny Ramírez. 
At the All-Star break, Ordóñez was hitting .312 with 16 HR and 62 RBI, 
and was a mainstay for a Tigers team that was a major-league best 59–29 
at the break. On October 14, 2006, Ordóñez completed the Tigers' sweep 
of the ALCS with a three-run homer against Huston Street of the Oakland 
Athletics, with two outs on a 1–0 count in the bottom of the 9th, the 8th 
time in MLB history that a post-season series has ended with a home run. 
The win sent the Tigers to their first World Series appearance since 1984. 
Coincidentally, it also happened 22 years to the day from when the Tigers 
won the World Series in that year. Ordóñez had the best season of his career 
in 2007. His .363 batting average, 28 home runs and 139 RBIs could be considered 
the best season by a Detroit Tigers batter until Miguel Cabrera won the 
Triple Crown in 2012. Ordonez finished second in the American League MVP 
race. Magglio's records and accomplishments in 2007 include: On April 29, 
2010, Ordóñez got his 2000th career hit against the Minnesota Twins' Carl 
Pavano.[4] On July 24 Ordóñez hurt his ankle sliding into home. X-rays 
revealed a fracture that was expected to heal in six to eight weeks, but 
some weeks after the injury it was reported Magglio would miss the rest 
of the season.[5] Following the season, the Tigers declined Ordóñez's $15 
million option for 2011.[6] On December 16, 2010, the Tigers re-signed 
Ordóñez to a 1-year, $10 million contract.[7] On October 8, 2011 during 
a playoff game with the Texas Rangers, Ordóñez re-fractured the ankle that 
he had fractured in 2010, he was then ruled out for the rest of the 2011 
postseason. On November 1, 2011, Tigers general manager David Dombrowski 
announced that the Tigers would "most likely" not offer Ordóñez a contract 
for the 2012 season, which makes Ordóñez a free agent.[8] On May 29, 2012 
it was reported that Ordonez would announce his retirement within the week.[9] 
On June 3, 2012, Ordonez officially retired from major league baseball 
in a ceremony at Comerica Park.[10] Magglio is the new owner of the Tribu.[11] 
In Detroit's Comerica Park, some Tiger fans sported curly black wigs underneath 
their baseball caps in support of their long-haired right fielder. This 
ended in mid-2009 when he cut his hair. He is also sometimes referred to 
affectionately as "Maggs". In mid-2006, a group of bloggers began referring 
to Magglio as "The Big Tilde". This nickname has been referenced on Deadspin, 
MLB.com, and during a Fox Sports broadcast.[12] Ordóñez has three children 
with his wife Dagly, a son named Magglio Jr. and two daughters, Maggliana 
and Sophia.[13][14] Ordóñez' son, Magglio Ordóñez Jr. was drafted by the 
Detroit Tigers in the 2014 Major League Baseball draft.[15] Ordóñez is 
the father of Valentina Mia who he fathered with Sandra Martinez in July 
2014.[16] Ordóñez was a supporter of the late Venezuelan President Hugo 
Chávez, and in early 2009 appeared in a televised political ad which assured 
the Venezuelan people that "the best of the revolution is yet to come."[17] 
He also joined Chávez on the campaign trail.[18] As a result, during the 
2009 World Baseball Classic, Ordóñez was booed by anti-Chávez Venezuelan 
fans, during his at bats, and while he was on the field.[19][20] In August 
2013, Ordóñez announced that he will be running for the office of mayor 
in the Juan Antonio Sotillo Municipality in Venezuela,[21] on the ticket 
of the late Chavez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela.[22] It was announced
