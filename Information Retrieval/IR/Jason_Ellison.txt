Ellison has become one of the more recognizable bench players in the major

in big leagues, hitting just .222, however he batted .250 as pinch-hitter. 
He hammered his second career leadoff home run on June 18. On April 1, 
2007, Ellison was traded to the Seattle Mariners for Travis Blackley, where 
he served much of the 2007 season as a fourth outfielder.[4] Ellison was 
a key part of an altercation between the Oakland Athletics and his Seattle 
Mariners that started after A's pitcher Joe Blanton collided with Mariners 
outfielder Ichiro Suzuki while retrieving a ball that had gotten away from 
the A's catcher. Ellison responded by charging Blanton, and a bench clearing 
scuffle ensued. In spite of this, Ellison was not ejected from the game, 
and went on to record the first 4-hit game of his major league career. 
In 2009, Ellison and Blanton became teammates on the Philadelphia Phillies. 
On August 3, 2007, the Seattle Mariners designated Ellison for assignment, 
making room on their 25-man roster for rookie outfielder Adam Jones to 
be called up from their Triple-A affiliate, the Tacoma Rainiers.[5] On 
August 7, the Cincinnati Reds claimed Ellison off waivers from the Mariners.[6] 
He finished the season for the Reds and was outrighted to the minor leagues 
on October 11. He refused the assignment and elected free agency. On January 
24, 2008, the Texas Rangers signed Ellison to a minor league contract with 
an invitation to spring training. After spending most of the season in
