Robert Lee Turley (September 19, 1930 – March 30, 2013), known as "Bullet 
Bob", was an American professional baseball player and financial planner. 
He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a pitcher from 1951 through 
1963. After his retirement from baseball, he worked for Primerica Financial 
Services. Turley made his MLB debut with the St. Louis Browns in 1951, 
and stayed with the team through their first season in Baltimore, when 
he appeared in his first MLB All-Star Game. After the 1954 season, he was 
traded to the New York Yankees. With the Yankees, Turley appeared in two 
more All-Star Games. He led the American League in wins in 1958, and won 
the Cy Young Award, World Series Most Valuable Player Award, and Hickok 
Belt that year. He finished his playing career with the Los Angeles Angels 
and Boston Red Sox in 1963, and then coached the Red Sox in 1964. Turley 
began working in financial planning during the baseball offseason. In 1977, 
he cofounded with Arthur L. Williams, Jr. the company that would become 
Primerica Financial Services. He also got involved in real estate, buying 
and selling 27 houses in Florida. Turley was born in Troy, Illinois.[1] 
He was raised in East St. Louis, Illinois. He attended East St. Louis Senior 
High School in East St. Louis, and played for the school's baseball squad 
for three years. He was used as both a starter and reliever, becoming the 
staff's ace pitcher by the end of his senior season, in 1948. Turley won 
the team's sportsmanship award that year.[2] Bill DeWitt, the general manager 
of the St. Louis Browns, brought Turley to Sportsman's Park for a tryout. 
Turley also attended a workout camp for the New York Yankees, held in Maryville, 
Illinois. The day after he graduated from high school in 1948, Turley signed 
with the Browns as an amateur free agent.[2] He received a $600 signing 
bonus ($5,919 in current dollar terms).[3] Turley made his professional 
debut that year in Minor League Baseball with the Belleville Stags of the 
Class D Illinois State League, pitching to a 9–3 win–loss record.[2] He 
was promoted to the Aberdeen Pheasants of the Class C Northern League in 
1949, and led the league in wins with 23, and strikeouts with 205.[2][4] 
He split the 1950 season with the Wichita Indians of the Class A Western 
League and the San Antonio Missions of the Class AA Texas League. Turley 
led Wichita in the Western League playoffs.[5] In 1951, he played for San 
Antonio. He appeared in the Texas League's All-Star Game,[6] and was named 
the league's most valuable player at the end of the season.[7] He struck 
out 22 batters in one game for San Antonio.[4] Turley played his first 
game in the major leagues on September 29, 1951. He lost to the Chicago 
White Sox. He did not pitch again in 1951, and after the season ended, 
he enlisted with the United States Army for two years.[7][8] Turley returned 
to the Browns in August 1953, and caught attention for his high strikeout 
rate.[9] Turley remained with the team after they moved to Baltimore, Maryland, 
to become the Baltimore Orioles in 1954. He earned $9,000 ($79,439 in current 
dollar terms) for the 1954 season.[10] He pitched the first game at Memorial 
Stadium, striking out nine in a complete game.[11] A power pitcher, Turley 
recorded many strikeouts, but did not have great control.[12][13] For the 
1954 season, he led the American League in strikeouts with 185, but also 
led the league with 181 walks.[14] That year, he earned comparisons to 
fellow fireballer Bob Feller,[13][15][16] and finished in third place in 
balloting for the Hickok Belt, given to the professional athlete of the 
year.[17] While playing for the Orioles, Turley obtained the nickname "Bullet 
Bob". The magazine Look wrote a story about Turley, and wanted to measure 
the velocity of his fastball. They used a bullet timer from the Aberdeen 
Proving Grounds, which recorded a speed of 98 miles per hour (158 km/h) 
by the time it reached home plate.[3] Casey Stengel, the manager of the 
New York Yankees, sought to acquire Turley. The Yankees needed younger 
starting pitchers, as their rotation fell off due to the ages of Allie 
Reynolds, Eddie Lopat, Johnny Sain, Tommy Byrne, and Jim Konstanty.[18] 
In order to acquire the hitting the Orioles decided they needed to compete, 
they traded Turley to the Yankees after the 1954 season.[14][19] The Yankees 
received Turley, Billy Hunter, Don Larsen, and players to be named later, 
while the Orioles acquired Harry Byrd, Jim McDonald, Willy Miranda, Hal 
Smith, Gus Triandos, Gene Woodling, and players to be named later. To complete 
the trade, the Yankees sent Bill Miller, Kal Segrist, Don Leppert, and 
Ted Del Guercio to the Orioles, and the Orioles sent Mike Blyzka, Darrell 
Johnson, Jim Fridley and Dick Kryhoski to the Yankees. Comprising 17 players, 
this trade remains the largest in MLB history.[11][18][20][21] Turley played 
for the Yankees from 1955 to 1962. In the 1955 season, Turley won 17 games 
for the Yankees,[22] and recorded 210 strikeouts, second to Herb Score 
(245). But, he also led the league in walks with 177.[4][23] The Yankees 
won the American League pennant, and advanced to the 1955 World Series, 
opposing the Brooklyn Dodgers. He pitched in Game Three of the 1955 World 
Series,[24] losing to Johnny Podres. He also made two relief appearances 
in the series, in Games Five and Seven, as the Dodgers defeated the Yankees 
four games to three.[25] Turley had a disappointing season in 1956, with 
an 8–4 win–loss record and a 5.05 earned run average (ERA).[22] However, 
the Yankees again won the American League pennant. Turley appeared in Games 
One and Two of the 1956 World Series against the Dodgers as a relief pitcher. 
Facing Clem Labine in Game Six, Turley pitched a complete game, but the 
Yankees lost the game by a 1–0 score.[26] The Yankees defeated the Dodgers 
in Game Seven to win the series four games to three.[27] In the 1957 season, 
Turley developed a curveball.[12] He finished the season with a 2.71 ERA, 
good for fourth-best in the American League.[28] The Yankees won the pennant 
again. In the 1957 World Series against the Milwaukee Braves, Turley started 
Game Three, but was relieved by Larsen in the second inning.[29] He won 
his first World Series game in Game Six, a complete game.[14] The Yankees 
lost the series to the Braves, four games to three.[29] By the 1958 season, 
Turley changed his delivery in an effort to improve his control, by using 
a no-wind up pitching position.[4][30] His best season came in 1958, when 
he won 21 games and lost seven, for an American League-leading .750 winning 
percentage. He also led the American League with 19 complete games, and 
finished with the sixth-best ERA (2.97). However, his 128 walks also led 
the league.[31] Turley started Game Two of the 1958 World Series by allowing 
up a leadoff home run and lasting just one-third of an inning as the Yankees 
fell behind the Milwaukee Braves two games to none.[32] With the Yankees 
one game away from elimination, Turley threw a complete game shutout in 
Game Five. He then recorded a 10th-inning save in Game Six.[32] A day later, 
in Game Seven, he relieved Don Larsen in the third inning and won his second 
game in three days, with 6 2⁄3 innings of two-hit relief.[32] The Yankees 
became just the second team to recover from a 3–1 World Series deficit, 
and Turley was voted the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.[32] As 
a result of his 1958 season, Turley won the Hickok Belt as top professional 
athlete of the year, receiving twice as many votes as Jim Brown, the second-place 
finisher.[33] He also won the Cy Young Award as the best pitcher in Major 
League Baseball, edging Warren Spahn of the Braves by one vote, and Lew 
Burdette of the Braves and Bob Friend of the Pittsburgh Pirates by two 
votes.[32][34] Turley finished second in the American League Most Valuable 
Player Award voting, losing to Jackie Jensen of the Boston Red Sox.[3][35] 
Additionally, he won The Sporting News' Player of the Year and Pitcher 
of the Year Awards.[36] Turley earned a $35,000 salary for the 1959 season, 
his highest as a baseball player.[37][38] The Yankees chose Turley to be 
their Opening Day starting pitcher for the 1959 season, opposing Tom Brewer 
of the Red Sox.[39] The Yankees won the game by a 3–2 score.[40] However, 
Turley's fastball began to lose its effectiveness. He increased the usage 
of his curveball to compensate.[30] Turley finished the year with an 8–11 
win-loss record. In the 1960 season, Turley had a 9–3 win-loss record,[41] 
and his 3.27 ERA was the seventh best in the American League.[42] He started 
Game Two of the 1960 World Series against the Pirates, earning the win. 
He also started the deciding Game Seven, which the Pirates won, taking 
the series.[43] Turley suffered through discomfort in his right elbow during 
the 1961 season, which resulted in a 3–5 win-loss record and 5.75 ERA in 
only 15 games pitched.[44] New manager Ralph Houk began to emphasize his 
younger pitchers, as he removed Turley from the starting rotation and used 
him as a relief pitcher.[45] Though the Yankees reached the 1961 World 
Series, and defeated the Cincinnati Reds four games to one, Turley did 
not make an appearance.[46] After seeking medical attention,[47] Turley 
was diagnosed with bone chips in his elbow. He underwent surgery in the 
offseason to remove the bone chips, and returned to the Yankees confident 
his performance would improve in 1962. He agreed to a salary cut, from 
$28,000 to $25,000.[48] However, the bone chips recurred during the 1962 
season. As a result, his effectiveness was limited in 1962 as well.[49] 
On June 25, Turley started a game that lasted 22 innings, and a record 
seven hours, but was removed after recording only one out.[50] During the 
1962 season, American League players elected Turley as their player representative, 
following Woodling's trade to the National League.[51][52] Over the season, 
Turley pitched to a 4.57 ERA in only 69 innings.[53] The Yankees defeated 
the San Francisco Giants four games to three in the 1962 World Series, 
but Turley was not an active participant.[54] After the 1962 season, the 
Yankees sold Turley to the Los Angeles Angels for cash, in the first move 
made by new Yankees' general manager Roy Hamey, who sought to rebuild the 
Yankees pitching staff.[49] The move was conditional; the Angels could 
return Turley if they were not satisfied with him. The Angels chose to 
retain Turley at the start of the 1963 season.[55] Turley struggled, winning 
two games while losing seven, and the Angels released him in July.[56] 
A week later, he signed with the Boston Red Sox.[57] Turley retired after 
the 1963 season, with a 101–85 win–loss record and a 3.64 ERA in 12 seasons.[21] 
After the 1963 season, Turley agreed to remain with the Red Sox as their 
pitching coach, succeeding Harry Dorish.[58] Turley spent one season as 
the Red Sox' pitching coach,[30] and was released at the end of the year.[59] 
He attempted to make a comeback as a pitcher with the Houston Colt .45s 
in 1965,[60] but did not make the team. He then agreed to become the pitching 
coach for the Richmond Braves of the International League, a minor league 
team in the Atlanta Braves organization, in 1966,[61] but resigned before 
the start of the 1966 season.[62][63] Turley moved from East St. Louis 
to Lutherville, Maryland, in 1954, when the Browns moved to Baltimore. 
Though he played in Baltimore for one season, he remained in Lutherville 
for the remainder of his baseball career, and sent his children to the 
local public schools.[11] Turley began working as a financial planner in 
1957, by selling life insurance.[37] He also operated a bowling alley in 
Bel Air, Maryland, and an insurance firm in Baltimore.[11] In 1977, Turley 
joined with Arthur L. Williams, Jr. and five others to found A. L. Williams 
& Associates, an insurance company.[3][64] At A. L. Williams, agents advised 
clients to purchase term life insurance, rather than cash value life insurance, 
and invest the money they saved in mutual funds.[37] The company became 
Primerica Financial Services, and was later bought out by Citigroup in 
1989.[37] He retired from the business in 2001, and sold half of his business 
to his son and the other half to Lynn Webb, a senior national sales director.[3] 
Later in his life, Turley resided in Blue Ridge, Georgia, and had a winter 
home on Marco Island, Florida.[3][37] Turley's hobby was real estate. He 
bought and sold many homes on Marco Island, including a 13,500 square feet 
(1,250 m2) home he built that was locally referred to as "Turley Mansion" 
and "Turley Castle". In total, Turley and his wife bought and sold 27 houses 
on Marco Island and in Naples, Florida.[3] Turley made an appearance on 
It's News to Me, a current events-based game show hosted by Walter Cronkite.[65] 
He was mentioned in a song called "St. Louis Browns" by Skip Battin, who 
was the bass guitarist of The Byrds and the New Riders of the Purple Sage. 
In the lyrics, Battin describes Turley as a "no-hit pitcher" who "got too 
surly" and who was "traded...too early".[66] Turley's uncle, Ralph, also 
played professional baseball. The Yankees signed Ralph Turley in 1949 when 
they meant to sign Bob, and released Ralph when they discovered he was 
the "wrong Turley".[2] Nik Turley, a Yankees prospect, identified Bob Turley 
as a "distant relative".[67] Turley lived in Alpharetta, Georgia, for the 
last two years of his life.[3] He died on March 30, 2013, in hospice care 
at Lenbrook, a retirement community in Atlanta at age 82 from liver cancer. 
He is survived by his second wife, Janet; two sons, Terry and Donald; daughter, 
Rowena; and seventeen grandchildren.[11][37][68] Turley was cremated in
