Otsego County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2010 
census, the population was 62,259.[1] The county seat is Cooperstown.[2] 
The name Otsego is from a Mohawk or Oneida word meaning "place of the rock."[3] 
Otsego County comprises the Oneonta, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area. 
In 1789, Ontario County was split off from Montgomery. The area split off 
from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, as it included 
the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, 
Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler 
and Wayne counties. Otsego County was one of three counties split off from 
Montgomery (the other two being Herkimer and Tioga). Otsego County was 
officially established on February 16, 1791, with Cooperstown as its county 
seat, although at the time the village of Cherry Valley was much larger. 
The original county consisted of three large townships: Otsego and Cherry 
Valley together roughly covered the area of modern Otsego County, while 
Harpersfield covered the area south of the current county as far as the 
Delaware River. The original appointments to Otsego County government positions, 
made by Governor George Clinton included: By 1793, four towns had been 
added to the county by division of the existing towns: In 1795, a piece 
of Otsego County was joined with a portion taken from Albany County to 
create Schoharie County. In 1797, a piece of Otsego County was joined with 
a portion taken from Ulster County to create Delaware County. According 
to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,016 square 
miles (2,630 km2), of which 1,002 square miles (2,600 km2) is land and 
14 square miles (36 km2) (1.4%) is water.[4] Otsego County is in central

James Fenimore Cooper), located at the south end of Otsego Lake, attracts 
many tourists to the Baseball Hall of Fame and the New York State Historical 
Association museums. Its primary industry is healthcare as it is home to 
Bassett Medical Center, the headquarters of Bassett Healthcare Network 
and its more than 3,000 employees. The City of Oneonta is the home of Hartwick 
College, the State University of New York at Oneonta, A.O. Fox Memorial 
Hospital an affiliate of the Bassett Network, major retail activity, and 
numerous small businesses. The county as a whole remains relatively rural, 
with dairy farming a contributing industry that has consolidated employment 
in recent years, although production has remained steady. Coordinates:
