The 2016 Nippon Professional Baseball season is the 67th season since the 
NPB was reorganized in 1950. A gambling scandal involving members of the 
Yomiuri Giants was reported in October. Pitchers Satoshi Fukuda, Shoki 
Kasahara, and Ryuya Matsumoto were found to have bet on both NPB games 
and Major League Baseball games, as well as high school baseball.[1][2] 
Note: In each league's stepladder playoff system (Climax Series), all games 
in that series are held at the higher seed's home stadium. The team with 
the higher regular-season standing also advanced if the round ended in 
a tie. Yomiuri Giants (1) vs. Yokohama DeNA BayStars (2) Fukuoka SoftBank 
Hawks (2) vs. Chiba Lotte Marines (0) Hiroshima Toyo Carp (4) vs. Yokohama 
DeNA BayStars (1) Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters (4) vs. Fukuoka SoftBank 
Hawks (2) Hiroshima Toyo Carp (2) vs. Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters (4)
