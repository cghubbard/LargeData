baseball player. Born in San Diego, California, he played 17 seasons in 
Major League Baseball as an infielder, outfielder, and designated hitter 
for the New York Yankees, Kansas City & Oakland Athletics, Philadelphia 
Phillies, Boston Red Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Chicago White Sox, Atlanta Braves, 
and Milwaukee Brewers during his 15-year major league career. He later 
served as a coach for 13 seasons with the California Angels (1979–80; 1989–92), 
New York Mets (1981), Philadelphia Phillies (1982–84), Seattle Mariners 
(1985–86), and Chicago White Sox (1987). Johnson was serving as a coach 
with California when he was diagnosed with lung cancer, which claimed his 
life on April 23, 1992, at the age of 53. Deron Johnson first appeared 
in a major league game on September 20, 1960. The 22-year-old was called 
upon to pinch hit in the ninth inning of a 1-1 tie between New York and 
Washington, facing Senators southpaw Hal Woodeshick. Mickey Mantle flied 
out to right and Bill Skowron doubled. Johnson advanced Skowron to third 
with a flyout to center. The Yankees won 2-1 in the 11th. He got his first 
two career hits on October 2, 1960 in the Yankees' last game of the regular 
season, an 8-7 win over the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. Johnson batted twice 
in the game—the first resulted in a fifth-inning double off Red Sox pitcher 
Jerry Casale, and in the seventh he singled off Arnold Earley.[1] Johnson's 
contract was purchased from Kansas City by the Cincinnati Reds on April 
5, 1963. Playing for Triple-A San Diego, he topped the Pacific Coast League 
with 33 home runs, tied for fifth with 91 RBI, and was picked as first 
baseman on the PCL All-Star team. 1964 was his first full season in the 
major leagues with the Reds where he posted a .273 average with 21 home 
runs and 79 runs batted in. The 1965 season with the Cincinnati Reds was 
one of his best during his career. Along with Frank Robinson, Pete Rose, 
Vada Pinson, Tony Pérez and Leo Cárdenas. Johnson at age 26 hit .287, blasted 
32 home runs, and drove in a National League leading 130 runs. Rose was 
quoted in 1983, "I had never seen anyone hit the ball harder than Deron 
Johnson."[citation needed] While playing for the Philadelphia Phillies 
in 1971 Johnson clubbed 34 homers and drove in over 90 runs. Johnson hit 
.300 in the 1973 World Series while playing with the Oakland A's. He opened 
1974 with the A's, but on June 24, 1974, he was released on waivers to 
the Milwaukee Brewers. On September 7, Johnson was sold to the Boston Red 
Sox, who were in the middle of a pennant fight they ultimately lost. The 
following April he signed with the White Sox. In 148 games for the White 
Sox, Johnson hit 18 home runs, and drove in 72 RBI. On September 21, after 
Jim Rice had been injured earlier in the day, the Red Sox once again needed 
supplemental power and reacquired Johnson. Johnson's last home run of his 
career came on September 27, 1975 off of Indians pitcher Rick Waits at 
Fenway Park. Johnson was a baseball and football star at San Diego High 
School. He was offered numerous college football scholarships but opted 
to sign with the Yankees. In 1979, Johnson was inducted by the San Diego 
Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's 
finest athletes. From 1958 to 1959 for six months he served in the U.S. 
Army under the Reserve Training Program, the first of several military 
stints during his baseball career.[2] After retiring as a Major League 
player, along with coaching in the majors, he owned a construction company 
in San Diego and operated a 40-acre cattle ranch.[3][4] When he died of 
cancer in 1992 he was survived by his wife Lucy Ann, sons Deron Jr. and 
Dominick and daughter Dena.[5] Deron Jr. is the longtime director of scouting
