As manager As coach James Richard "Jim" Leyland (born December 15, 1944) 
is a retired Major League Baseball manager. He currently serves as a special 
assistant to the Detroit Tigers and is the manager of the United States 
national baseball team. He led the Florida Marlins to a World Series championship 
in 1997, and previously won three straight division titles (1990, 1991, 
and 1992) with the Pittsburgh Pirates. With the Tigers victory in the 2006 
American League Championship Series, Leyland became the seventh manager 
in history to win pennants in both the National and American Leagues. He 
is a three-time Manager of the Year Award winner, twice in the National 
League (1990 and 1992), and once in the American League (2006). Leyland 
began his baseball career with the Tigers when they signed him as a catcher 
on September 21, 1963. He spent seven seasons as a minor leaguer in the 
Tigers organization (1964–1970), but mainly served as a coach with the 
Montgomery Rebels in 1970 while playing in just two games for the team. 
Leyland was a career .222 hitter in the minor leagues. In 1972, Leyland 
became a minor league manager in the Tigers organization; beginning with 
the Clinton Pilots of the Midwest League; from 1979–1981, he was the manager 
of the Evansville Triplets winning two divisions (1979, 1981) in the American 
Association. Leyland left the Tigers organization for the first time in 
1982 when he became Tony La Russa's third base coach for four seasons (1982–85) 
with the Chicago White Sox, including the team's 1983 AL West division 
title, before being named the 33rd manager in Pittsburgh Pirates history 
on November 20, 1985. Leyland was the manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates 
from 1986 to 1996. He won two Manager of the Year trophies with the Pirates 
in 1990 and 1992, and finished as runner-up in 1988 and 1991. Leyland helped 
develop such All-Stars as Barry Bonds, Jay Bell, Tim Wakefield, Andy Van 
Slyke and Bobby Bonilla in Pittsburgh before a fire sale in the mid-1990s 
soured him with new ownership. Under Leyland, the Pirates went to the National 
League Championship Series in three straight seasons (1990, 1991, and 1992). 
The Pirates lost all three of those NLCS, however, with the latter two 
going the full seven games against the Atlanta Braves. Although he has 
moved on in his career, Leyland still keeps his home in the Pittsburgh 
suburb of Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania[1][2] where he met his wife Katie[3] 
and has raised two children, Pat[4] and Kellie. Both attended Bishop Canevin 
High School. One member of Leyland's coaching staff while with the Pirates, 
Terry Collins, the manager of the New York Mets, wears number 10 to honor 
Leyland.[5][6][7] In 1997, Leyland was hired by Wayne Huizenga to manage 
the Florida Marlins and promptly led them to the franchise's first championship. 
The Marlins, in only their fifth year of existence, became the fastest 
expansion franchise to win a World Series. The Arizona Diamondbacks surpassed 
the Marlins when they won the World Series in 2001, their fourth season. 
In the offseason, Huizenga dismantled the team in what became known as 
"the fire sale." After Game 7, when asked about rumors that he might retire 
if Huizenga sold the franchise, Leyland quipped, "My wife doesn't like 
me that much. I can't retire."[8] Leyland indeed remained as the manager, 
but resigned after the 1998 season, when the Marlins went 54–108. At his 
press conference, Leyland remarked that he thought his job was to win championships, 
but that apparently was not what Huizenga wanted.[citation needed] Leyland 
was subsequently hired by the Colorado Rockies for the 1999 season, walking 
away from the final two years of his contract. When he left managing after 
the 1999 season, he became a Pittsburgh-based scout for the St. Louis Cardinals.[9] 
Following the release of Alan Trammell as the manager of the Tigers, Leyland 
was hired as new Tigers manager, returning to the franchise with which 
he spent the first 18 years of his professional baseball career.[10] It 
marked the first time Leyland managed in the American League. In the 2006 
regular season, Leyland guided the Tigers to a 95–67 record, the Tigers 
best season since 1987. The Tigers entered the playoffs as a wild card, 
and went on to defeat the New York Yankees and sweep the Oakland Athletics 
to win the American League pennant before falling to the St. Louis Cardinals 
in the 2006 World Series. In leading the team to the AL pennant, he became 
the seventh manager to win pennants in both major leagues, joining Joe 
McCarthy, Yogi Berra, Alvin Dark, Sparky Anderson, Dick Williams, and Tony 
La Russa. After the 2006 season ended, Leyland was recognized with the 
Manager of the Year award for the third time in his career. He became the 
third person to win the award in both leagues, joining La Russa and Bobby 
Cox. Leyland also won The Sporting News Manager of the Year Award for the 
American League in 2006. In 2011, Leyland led the Tigers to another 95–67 
regular season record, winning the American League Central Division. They 
went on to defeat the New York Yankees in the American League Division 
Series before losing to the Texas Rangers in the American League Championship 
Series. On May 1, 2012, Leyland gained his 1,600th victory as a major league 
manager, passing Tommy Lasorda on the all-time wins list.[11] In 2012, 
Leyland led the Tigers to an 88–74 regular season record, winning the American 
League Central Division. On that team, Tiger third baseman Miguel Cabrera 
was the American League Triple Crown winner that season. This was the first 
Triple Crown winner in Major League Baseball since Carl Yastrzemski in 
1967. When the Tigers won the AL Central for the second consecutive season, 
Leyland became the only Tigers manager besides Hughie Jennings to lead 
Detroit to the postseason three times. In the 2012 postseason, Detroit 
defeated the Athletics in a five-game ALDS and returned to the World Series 
following a sweep of the New York Yankees in the American League Championship 
Series. Detroit was swept in the 2012 World Series by the San Francisco 
Giants. They were shut out twice, the same number as in the entire 162-game 
regular season, and had a team batting average of .165. On September 25, 
2013, Leyland won his 700th game with the Tigers. With the 1–0 victory 
over the Minnesota Twins, the Tigers clinched their third consecutive American 
League Central Division title.[12] Leyland joined former coach Tony La 
Russa as the only managers who have led two different MLB franchises to 
three consecutive division titles. He retired from managing following the 
2013 season, remaining with the Tigers organization as a special assistant.[13][14] 
He was replaced by Brad Ausmus. On April 15, 2016, Leyland was named the 
manager of Team USA at the 2017 World Baseball Classic.[15] His son, Pat 
Leyland, was drafted by the Tigers in 2010 and has also played in the Seattle
