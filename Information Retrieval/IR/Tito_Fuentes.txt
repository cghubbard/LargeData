Rigoberto Fuentes Peat (born January 4, 1944) is a retired professional 
baseball player. He played for 13 seasons in the major leagues between 
1965 and 1978, primarily as a second baseman. Fuentes played for most of 
his career with the San Francisco Giants, where he still remains a fan 
favorite. The Giants initially signed Fuentes as an 18-year-old amateur 
before the start of the 1962 season. He was one of the last baseball players 
signed directly out of Cuba before the United States embargo against Cuba. 
Originally debuting in the majors 1965 as a late-season call-up, Fuentes 
split time between second base and shortstop as a rookie in 1966. He batted 
.261 in his maiden year while playing solid defense at both positions.[1] 
He slumped to batting .209 the following year, and subsequently, he spent 
all of 1968 in the minor leagues. Fuentes returned to the Giants in 1969 
and spent the next two seasons as a utility infielder before re-gaining 
his starting spot at second base in 1971. He appeared in the postseason 
during the 1971 season as his Giants won the NL West title; his two-run 
home run in Game 1 of the 1971 NLCS helped San Francisco take an early 
series lead against the Pittsburgh Pirates,[2] but that would turn out 
to be the Giants' only win of the best-of-five series. Fuentes continued 
to be the Giants' second baseman for three more seasons. In 1973, he set 
a National League record by recording a .993 fielding percentage, the highest 
for any regular second baseman in league history.[3] Ironically, Fuentes 
had led all National League second basemen in errors during the previous 
two seasons before setting the new record for excellence. His record stood 
for 13 seasons before Ryne Sandberg recorded a .994 percentage at second 
in 1986. After the 1974 season, San Francisco traded Fuentes and a future 
Rookie of the Year, Butch Metzger, to the San Diego Padres for another 
second baseman, Derrel Thomas. Tito played for two seasons in San Diego 
before leaving as a free agent. In 1977, Fuentes played with the Detroit 
Tigers and had a career-best .309 batting average. Despite having his best 
season, he was not brought back in 1978 (since the Tigers had a young Lou 
Whitaker waiting in the wings). The Montreal Expos then purchased his contract. 
Before the start of the season, however, Fuentes was released. During the 
year, he signed with the Oakland Athletics, but he was released again after 
batting just .140 in only 13 games. He played for the Santo Domingo Azucareros 
in the short-lived Inter-American League in 1979 before retiring. Fuentes 
returned to the Giants as a radio announcer in 1981, the team's first year 
of Spanish language radio broadcasts, initially serving in this role until 
1992. In 2004, Fuentes was brought back as an analyst, and he remains with 
the team in this role today.[4] Tito Fuentes was inducted into the Hispanic 
Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame on February 23, 2002 in San Francisco,
