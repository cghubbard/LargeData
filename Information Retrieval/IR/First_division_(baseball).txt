First division is a term that has had various meanings, at various times, 
in the sport of baseball, but originally referred to the rankings within 
a league. Teams which ranked in the top half of the league standings table 
(e.g. the top five teams in a ten-team league) were said to have finished 
in the "first division", while teams in the bottom half of the standings 
were said to be in the "second division". In the major leagues before 1969, 
players on teams finishing in the first division received monetary shares 
from the Players' Pool, which was funded by gate receipts from that year's 
World Series; specifically, prior to the aforementioned expansion, the 
team winning the World Series received 42% of this money, the team losing 
the World Series got 28%, with the second-, third- and fourth-place teams 
in each league being awarded 7½%, 5% and 2½% respectively. Concomitant 
with the expansion, 1% was taken from both of the World Series teams and 
given to each of the teams finishing in fifth place. The New York Yankees 
finished in the first division for a record 39 consecutive years, from 
1926 through 1964, all inclusive; by contrast, the Chicago Cubs once finished 
in the second division for 20 years in a row — between 1947 and 1966. With 
the realignment of both leagues into two geographically based divisions 
in 1969, the terms "first division" and "second division" quickly fell 
into disuse (largely because the word "division" had acquired a completely 
different meaning), although teams finishing in the top half of the standings 
— now the first three teams in each of the new divisions — continued to 
share in the Players' Pool. The distribution of the Players' Pool money 
was also changed at this time, with the World Series winner henceforth 
getting 36% of the pool, its loser 27%, the losers of the League Championship 
Series 12½% each, the second-place teams in the divisions 2 3/8% each, 
and the third-place teams 5/8% each. In 1991 these shares were revised 
to 36%, 24%, 12%, 3% and 1% respectively, and when both major leagues realigned 
again in 1995 (each league now consisting of three divisions, the winners 
thereof plus one wild card team in each league reaching the postseason), 
the 3% shares went to teams losing in the Division Series and the 1% shares 
went to the teams that finished second in their division but did not earn 
a wild card. The terms "first division" and "second division" are rarely 
if ever used in baseball today, except in a historical context — and even 
their original meanings have become obsolete since the proportion of Major 
League Baseball teams sharing in the Players' Pool has fallen significantly 
below one-half because the number of teams receiving shares has not risen 
in concert with the increase in the number of teams as the result of expansion: 
In 1977 the American League expanded to 14 teams, but the number of AL 
teams qualifying for postseason money remained at six — three in each division, 
even though the divisions now had seven teams in them. The National League 
followed suit in 1993, and the addition of the Arizona Diamondbacks and 
Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 1998 decreased the percentage of major-league teams 
being awarded Players' Pool shares to two-fifths (12 out of 30). Originally, 
the Players' Pool was funded by a portion of the gate receipts from the 
first four games of the World Series; as baseball added more rounds of 
playoffs, the receipts from the first four games of best-of-seven series, 
and the first three of best-of-five series, were included as well, so that 
players on teams qualifying for shares of the pool receive several times 
more money today — even adjusting for inflation — than their counterparts
