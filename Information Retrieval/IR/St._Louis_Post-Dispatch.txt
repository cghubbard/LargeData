The St. Louis Post-Dispatch is the major regional newspaper in St. Louis, 
in the U.S. state of Missouri, serving Greater St. Louis. It is the only 
remaining printed daily newspaper in the city. It is the fifth-largest 
newspaper in the midwestern United States, and is the 26th-largest newspaper 
in the U.S.[3] The paper is owned by Lee Enterprises of Davenport, Iowa, 
which purchased Pulitzer, Inc. in 2005 in a cash deal valued at $1.46 billion. 
Circulation dropped for the daily paper from 213,472 to 191,631 to 178,801 
for the two years after 2010, ending on September 30, 2011, and September 
30, 2012. The Sunday paper also decreased from 401,427 to 332,825 to 299,227.[4] 
According to Echomedia.com, the paper's paid print circulation figures 
(updated on June 5, 2014) were 225,889 daily and 252,000 Sunday,[5] while 
St. Louis Magazine mentioned the corresponding figures from the Alliance 
for Audited Media in March 2014 for the previous six-month average were 
137,380 daily and 223,826 Sunday.[2] On April 10, 1907, Pulitzer wrote 
what became known as the paper's platform: I know that my retirement will 
make no difference in its cardinal principles, that it will always fight 
for progress and reform, never tolerate injustice or corruption, always 
fight demagogues of all parties, never belong to any party, always oppose 
privileged classes and public plunderers, never lack sympathy with the 
poor, always remain devoted to the public welfare, never be satisfied with 
merely printing news, always be drastically independent, never be afraid 
to attack wrong, whether by predatory plutocracy or predatory poverty.[6] 
In 1878, Joseph Pulitzer purchased the bankrupt St. Louis Dispatch at a 
public auction[7] and merged it with the St. Louis Evening Post to create 
the St. Louis Post and Dispatch, whose title was soon shortened to its 
current form. He appointed John A. Cockerill as the managing editor. Its 
first edition, 4,020 copies of four pages each, appeared on December 12, 
1878. In 1882, James Overton Broadhead ran for US Congress against John 
Glover. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, at Cockerill's direction, ran a number 
of articles questioning Broadhead's role in a lawsuit between a gaslight 
company and the city; Broadhead never responded to the charges.[8] Broadhead's 
friend and law partner, Alonzo W. Slayback, publicly defended Broadhead, 
asserting that the St. Louis Post-Dispatch was nothing more than a "blackmailing 
sheet." The next day, 13 Oct 1882, Cockerill re-ran an offensive "card" 
by John Glover that the paper had published the prior November (11 Nov 
1881). Incensed, Slayback barged into Cockerill's offices at the paper 
demanding an apology. Cockerill shot and killed Slayback; he claimed self-defense, 
and a pistol was allegedly found on Slayback's body. A grand jury refused 
to indict Cockerill for murder, but the economic consequences for the paper 
were severe. Therefore, in May 1883, Pulitzer sent Cockerill to New York 
to manage the New York World for him.[9] At one time, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch 
had the second-largest news bureau in Washington, D.C. of any newspaper 
in the Midwestern United States.[10] After his retirement, generations 
of Pulitzers guided the newspaper, ending when great-grandson Joseph Pulitzer 
IV left the company in 1995. The old Post-Dispatch was characterized by 
a liberal editorial page and columnists, including Marquis Childs. The 
editorial page was noted also for political cartoons by Daniel R. Fitzpatrick 
and Bill Mauldin. The Post-Dispatch was one of the first daily newspapers 
to print a comics section in color, on the back page of the features section, 
styled the "Everyday Magazine."[citation needed] Several months prior to 
the anniversary edition, the newspaper published a 63rd anniversary tribute 
to "Our Own Oddities", a lighthearted feature that ran from 1940 to 1990. 
During the presidency of Harry S. Truman, the paper was one of his most 
outspoken critics. It associated him with the Pendergast machine in Kansas 
City, and constantly attacked his integrity. On February 11, 1901, the 
paper introduced a front page feature called the "Weatherbird", a cartoon 
bird accompanying the daily weather forecast. "Weatherbird" is the oldest 
continuous cartoon in the United States today. Created by Harry B. Martin 
who drew it through 1903, it has since been drawn by Oscar Chopin (1903–1910); 
S. Carlisle Martin (1910–1932); Amadee Wohlschlaeger (1932–1981); Albert 
Schweitzer, the first one to draw the Weatherbird in color (1981–1986); 
and Dan Martin (1986–present).[11] On January 13, 2004, the Post-Dispatch 
published a 125th anniversary edition, which included some highlights of 
the paper's 125 years: On January 31, 2005, Michael Pulitzer announced 
the sale of Pulitzer, Inc. and all its assets, including the Post-Dispatch 
and a small share of the St. Louis Cardinals, to Lee Enterprises of Davenport, 
Iowa, for $1.46 billion. He said no family members would serve on the board 
of the merged company. The Post-Dispatch underwent a major redesign in 
September 2005, which brought a new layout, new fonts, and localized editions 
for St. Charles County and Illinois. Many readers have criticized the new 
format for devoting a larger percentage of page space to advertisements 
and relying too much on wire services and dispatches from other newspapers.[citation

circulation, classified phone rooms, production, purchasing, telephone 
operations and marketing departments.[12] On March 23, 2009, the paper 
converted to a compact style every day from the previous broadsheet Sunday 
through Friday and tabloid on Saturday. On May 4, 2012, the Post-Dispatch 
named a new editor, Gilbert Bailon. "Robbins steps down as editor of St. 
Louis Post-Dispatch, Bailon takes role".[citation needed] The Post-Dispatch 
prices are: $1.50 daily, $2.50 Sunday/Thanksgiving Day. On October 1, 2012, 
the price of the daily edition increased by 50% to $1.50. Six days later 
its Sunday/Thanksgiving edition increased its price 25%. Sales tax is included 
at newsracks. On April 28, 2014, the paper implemented a partial pay wall 
digital subscription online for $24.80 for eight weeks. The introductory
