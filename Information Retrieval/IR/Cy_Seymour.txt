James Bentley "Cy" Seymour (December 9, 1872 – September 20, 1919) was 
an American center fielder and pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). 
From 1896 through 1913, Seymour played for the New York Giants (1896–1900, 
1906–1910), Baltimore Orioles (1901–1902), Cincinnati Reds (1902–1906) 
and Boston Braves (1913). He batted and threw left-handed. Primarily a 
center fielder, Seymour retired with 1,724 hits and a lifetime batting 
average of .303. He was a pitcher for his first five seasons, ending his 
MLB career with a 61–56 win–loss record and a 3.76 earned run average in 
140 games pitched (123 as a starting pitcher). Only Babe Ruth retired with 
more combined wins and hits.[1] Seymour is the Reds' career leader in batting 
average (.332) and holds the Reds' single-season record for batting average 
(.377 in 1905). Seymour played semi-professional baseball in Plattsburgh, 
New York, receiving a monthly salary of $1,000 ($28,492 in current dollar 
terms).[1] He began his professional career in minor league baseball with 
Springfield Ponies of the Class-A Eastern League and New York Metropolitans 
of the Class-A Atlantic League in 1896.[1][2] Seymour signed with the New 
York Giants of the National League (NL) during the 1896 season, making 
his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut on April 22.[3] A sometimes wild 
pitcher, The New York Times described him as having a "$10,000 arm and 
a $00,000 head".[4] Seymour set a MLB record with three errors in one inning, 
a record later tied by Tommy John.[5] However, he pitched to an 18–14 win–loss 
record in 1897, with a 3.37 earned run average (ERA), while recording 149 
strikeouts, good for second in the NL.[1] In 1898, he won 25 games, had 
a 3.18 ERA, and led the NL in strikeouts with 239, while leading the team 
in wins and games started (43).[1] During the season, Seymour pitched three 
games in two days against the Baltimore Orioles. Orioles manager John McGraw 
later said that Seymour deserved the title of "Iron Man" more than Joe 
McGinnity.[6] Seymour held out from the Giants for the first month of the 
1899 season in a contract dispute, eventually signing for $2,000 ($56,984 
in current dollar terms), a $500 raise ($14,246 in current dollar terms) 
over his 1898 salary.[1] He finished second in the NL in strikeouts with 
142.[1] Seymour was briefly demoted to the minor leagues after walking 
11 batters in a victory against the St. Louis Perfectos on June 7, 1900.[7] 
Due to injuries and the ineffectiveness of the Giants' outfielders, the 
team began to play Seymour in the outfield, though they insisted that Seymour 
would not shift positions on a permanent basis.[1] Seymour last pitched 
for the Giants that season, at which point he converted into an outfielder 
full-time due to injury from throwing the screwball.[1] With the formation 
of the American League (AL) as a competitor to the NL, Seymour joined many 
fellow NL players who jumped to the AL.[8] McGraw, remembering Seymour's 
toughness in previous seasons, signed Seymour to his team, the Baltimore 
Orioles, before the 1901 season.[1] Seymour batted .303 with the Orioles 
that year.[3] By 1902, the franchise began to fall into significant debt. 
Joe Kelley, star player for the Orioles and son-in-law of part-owner John 
Mahon, reported that the team owed as much as $12,000 ($328,754 in current 
dollar terms).[9] Unable to afford that debt, Mahon purchased shares of 
the team from Kelley and player-manager McGraw, who had resigned from the 
team and signed with the Giants. With this, Mahon became the majority shareholder. 
On July 17, 1902, Mahon sold his interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman, 
principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the 
Cincinnati Reds, also of the NL. That day, Freedman and Brush released 
Seymour, McGraw, Kelley, McGinnity, Roger Bresnahan, Jack Cronin, and Dan 
McGann from their Oriole contracts. Brush then signed Seymour and Kelley 
to the Reds, while Freedman signed McGinnity, Bresnahan, Cronin, and McGann, 
joining McGraw, his new player-manager, on the Giants.[10] Reds owner Garry 
Herrmann added $100 per month ($2,740 in current dollar terms) to Seymour's 
$2,800 annual salary ($76,709 in current dollar terms) when he acquired 
him from Baltimore, and made him the team's starting center fielder.[1] 
He set a record with four sacrifice bunts in one game on July 25, 1902; 
this mark was tied by Jake Daubert on August 15, 1914.[11] Seymour continued 
to bat above .300 with the Reds in each season through 1905, when he led 
the NL in batting average (.377), hits (219), runs batted in (RBI) (121), 
doubles (40), triples (21), and slugging percentage (.559).[1][3] He would 
have won the Triple Crown but he finished second in home runs with eight, 
behind Fred Odwell's nine.[1] His .377 batting average set the single-season 
record for the Reds,[12] and his 325 total bases that season were an NL 
record through 1919. Seymour had a .333 batting average during his tenure 
with the Reds, which remains a franchise record.[13] The Giants purchased 
Seymour from the Reds on July 12, 1906 for $10,000 ($263,815 in current 
dollar terms), the largest monetary transaction in baseball to date.[1] 
Seymour attempted to hold out from the Giants in order to obtain a portion 
of this transfer fee, claiming that Herrmann had promised him this money 
if the sale was completed.[14] McGraw convinced Seymour not to hold out, 
which could have set a precedent for players obtaining money in player 
transactions.[1] He batted .286 in 1906 for the Reds and Giants, finishing 
eighth in the NL.[1] Seymour finished fifth in the NL in batting average 
(.294) for the 1907 season.[15] However, an ankle injury prematurely ended 
his season.[16] His batting average declined to .267 for the 1908 season. 
That year, he participated in one of baseball's most infamous plays, known 
as Merkle's Boner, in which the Giants lost the pennant to the Chicago 
Cubs. In the replayed game between the Giants and Cubs, Giants pitcher 
Christy Mathewson reportedly waved Seymour to move further back in the 
outfield; Seymour refused, only to see the ball hit over his head, allowing 
the Cubs to score three runs on their way to the win.[17] Mathewson later 
denied waving Seymour back, saying Seymour "knew the Chicago batters as 
well as [he] did and how to play them."[18] As there were no full-time 
base coaches at the time, players took turns in the role. While coaching 
at third base, Seymour tackled teammate Moose McCormick as he rounded third 
base and headed for home plate, in an attempt to keep McCormick at third. 
McCormick overpowered Seymour and scored. When McGraw asked why, Seymour 
made an excuse about having the sun in his eyes.[19] This led McGraw, now 
realizing the need for a full-time coach, to hire Arlie Latham for the 
role, the first full-time coach in MLB.[20] Seymour got into an altercation 
with Latham in March 1909 at the team's hotel, prompting McGraw to seek 
a buyer for Seymour.[21] Seymour apologized to McGraw,[22] who responded 
by suspending Seymour for eight weeks. However, Seymour injured his right 
leg in his first game back from the suspension.[23] This injury limited 
his effectiveness for the rest of his career.[24] As a part-time player 
that season, he batted .311, best among NL reserves.[1] He again played 
a reserve role for the Giants in 1910, batting .265 in 79 games.[3] The 
minor league Baltimore Orioles of the Class-A Eastern League purchased 
Seymour from the Giants on August 24, 1910.[25] After playing for the Orioles 
in the 1911 season, they sold him to the Newark Indians of the Class-AA 
International League, where he played during the 1912 season.[26] Seymour 
became property of the Los Angeles Angels of the Class-A Pacific Coast 
League after the 1912 season, but he secured his release from the Angels 
without playing a game for them,[27] Seymour subsequently signed as a free 
agent with the Boston Braves on February 25, 1913.[27] After playing sparingly 
for the Braves during the 1913 season, the Braves released him on July 
19, 1913, as they were carrying 26 players on their roster, though league 
rules permitted a maximum roster of 25.[28][29] Seymour played for the 
Buffalo Bisons of the Class-A International League after being released 
by the Braves. He returned to professional baseball in 1918, playing in 
13 games for the Newark Bears of the International League.[1] Seymour was 
declared physically unfit for service in World War I. However, he worked 
in wartime jobs in the Speedway shipyards and Bush terminal. While working 
in the shipyards, he contracted tuberculosis, and died at his home on September 
20, 1919.[1] He was interred in Albany Rural Cemetery.[30] Few players 
enjoyed as much success as Seymour as both a pitcher and hitter; only Babe 
Ruth recorded more combined pitching victories and hits.[1] As a pitcher, 
Seymour threw a fastball, a curveball, and a screwball. Orioles catcher 
Wilbert Robinson said that he had never caught a pitcher as wild as Seymour, 
as opposing batters did "not know whether their head or feet were in most 
danger."[1] "I look upon Seymour as the greatest straight ball player of 
the age, by that I mean he is absolutely all right if you let him play 
the game his own way. But if you try to mix up any science on him you are 
likely to injure his effectiveness." In his 16-year MLB career, Seymour 
hit 52 home runs with 799 RBI, 1,723 hits, 222 stolen bases, and a .303 
batting average.[1] He also won 61 games as a pitcher.[1] Seymour was posthumously 
inducted in the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1998.[12] The New York 
World listed Seymour as one of the best players in baseball, along with 
Mathewson, Ed Walsh, Honus Wagner, Nap Lajoie, and Roger Bresnahan.[1] 
Elmer Flick insisted that Seymour was the toughest pitcher he batted against, 
saying he "was practically unhittable" and that Seymour "had a wonderful 
control of his curve ball."[1] According to a formula for evaluating baseball 
players developed by Bill James, Seymour ranks above Hall of Famers Lloyd
