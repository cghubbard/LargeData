Infield is a sports term whose definition depends on the sport in whose 
context it is used. In baseball the baseball diamond plus a region beyond 
it, has both grass and dirt, in contrast to the more distant, usually grass-covered 
outfield. It also refers to the defensive unit of players that are positioned 
in the region: first baseman, second baseman, shortstop, third baseman. 
Sometimes it includes the catcher and pitcher who (as a tandem) are often 
referred to separately as the battery. In baseball the physical infield 
is where most of the action in a baseball game occurs, as it includes that 
area where the all-important duel between the pitcher and batter takes 
place.[1] The pitcher stands on the pitcher's mound (a raised mound of 
dirt located at the center of the infield) and from there he pitches the 
ball to his catcher, who is crouched behind home plate sixty feet, six 
inches away at what might be called the cutlet of the diamond-shaped baseball 
field. To the left and right of the catcher are chalk boxes in the dirt 
called batter's boxes. The opposing team's batter must stand in one of 
the two boxes and from there he will attempt to hit the pitched ball with 
his bat. The umpire, who officiates the game, stands behind the catcher. 
The other important parts of the infield are the three bases, first base 
(to the pitcher's left, looking toward home plate), second base (behind 
the pitcher) and third base (to the pitcher's right). Together, home plate 
and the three bases form a diamond around the pitcher, with each side of 
the diamond measuring 90 feet.[2] In cricket infield is a central oval 
on the cricket field, the reference point for fielding restrictions in 
short forms of the game; in contrast to the more distant outfield Infield 
can refer to a region inside a closed horse racing or auto racing track,
