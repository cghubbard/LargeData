Jair Francoise Jurrjens (/ˈdʒaɪ.ər ˈdʒɜːrdʒənz/ JY-ər JUR-jənz; born January 
29, 1986) is a Curaçaoan professional baseball pitcher who is currently 
a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit 
Tigers, Atlanta Braves, Baltimore Orioles, and Colorado Rockies and in 
the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) for the Uni-President 7-Eleven 
Lions. Jurrjens was named after the Biblical judge Jair by his mother Esther.[1] 
She and Jurrjens' father, Carl, have two other children, Carl, Sr. and 
Charlotte.[2][3] In 2002, Jurrjens' Curaçao Senior League team won the 
Senior League World Series in Bangor, Maine.[4] Jurrjens speaks English, 
Spanish, Dutch and Papiamentu.[2] Jurrjens was signed as an undrafted free 
agent by the Detroit Tigers in 2003. In seven games during his 2003 campaign 
with the GCL Tigers, Jurrjens accumulated a 2–1 record with 20 strikeouts 
and just three walks. However, Jurrjens really broke out during his 2005 
season with the West Michigan Whitecaps, the Tigers' single-A affiliate. 
In 26 games started, Jurrjens went 12–6 with 108 strikeouts and 36 walks. 
He continued to improve during the 2006 season, as a 5–0, 2.08 ERA start 
with the Whitecaps earned Jurrjens a promotion to the Erie SeaWolves, the 
Tigers' Double-A affiliate. In 12 games with the SeaWolves, Jurrjens went 
4–3 with a 3.36 ERA. Jurrjens began the 2007 season pitching for the SeaWolves. 
On August 15, the Tigers purchased Jurrjens' contract from the SeaWolves, 
adding him to their 40-man roster. Jurrjens made his major league debut 
on August 15, 2007, as a starting pitcher against the Cleveland Indians, 
making him the first pitcher from Curaçao to reach the major leagues.[1] 
In that game, he gave up four earned runs in seven innings, taking the 
loss.[5] He recorded his first major league win in his next start, also 
against the Indians, allowing only one run on one hit in 6 2⁄3 innings 
pitched.[6] Jurrjens joined fellow Curaçao native Andruw Jones on the Netherlands 
national baseball team for the 2006 World Baseball Classic. Jurrjens pitched 
one inning against Puerto Rico in the WBC, giving up three runs and earning 
him a loss.[7][8] On October 29, 2007, Jurrjens and outfielder Gorkys Hernandez 
were traded to the Atlanta Braves for shortstop Edgar Rentería.[9] Jurrjens 
was listed by Baseball America as the Braves' 3rd-best prospect entering 
the 2008 season.[10] By the end of April 2008, Jurrjens was 3–2 with a 
3.05 ERA and 28 strikeouts. Jurrjens was asked prior to the game on April 
20 about how he felt facing his fellow countryman Andruw Jones. Jurrjens 
said, "It's going to be fun to face him", then said "It's going to be even 
more fun to strike him out." [11] Jurrjens then went on to strike Jones 
out all three times he faced him.[12] Jurrjens pitched well throughout 
the first half of the 2008 season, compiling a 9–4 record with an impressive 
3.00 ERA prior to the All-Star Break. On July 9, 2008 Jurrjens was named 
National League Rookie of the Month for the month of June.[13] Jurrjens 
appeared to tire during the second half of the season, going 4–6 with a 
subpar 4.66 ERA after the All-Star Break. Overall, Jurrjens finished his 
rookie season with a record of 13–10 and a 3.68 ERA in 188 1⁄3 innings. 
Jurrjens finished third in voting for the 2008 NL Rookie of the Year award. 
Jurrjens lost the award to Geovany Soto with Joey Votto finishing second. 
Despite his impressive rookie season, some remained skeptical of Jurrjens' 
future prospects as a pitcher in the major leagues.[14][15] As a result, 
Jurrjens went into the 2009 season looking to avoid a "sophomore slump."[16] 
Jurrjens again pitched very well in the first half of 2009, going just 
7–7 but posting an excellent 2.91 ERA in 19 starts. Unlike 2008, there 
would be no drop-off in the second half for Jurrjens, as he went 7–3 with 
an exceptional 2.24 ERA in 15 second-half starts. Overall in 2009, Jurrjens 
went 14–10 while finishing third in the National League with a 2.60 ERA 
in 215 innings and tying for the league lead with 34 games started.[17] 
Jurrjens went 7–6 with a 4.64 ERA in 2010, a season in which he dealt with 
some health problems.[18] He underwent arthroscopic surgery for a torn 
meniscus in his right knee in October, having missed September and the 
Division Series with pain in his knee.[19] Jurrjens began the 2011 season 
on the disabled list, but got off to a strong start after he was activated. 
He pitched his first career shutout on July 1, 2011 against the Baltimore 
Orioles, allowing one hit and one walk.[20] It was his eleventh win of 
the season and improved his ERA to a league-best 1.89 ERA.[21] Jurrjens 
led the National League in wins and ERA at the All-Star break, and was 
chosen to play in his first All-Star Game. He pitched 1 2⁄3 scoreless innings 
in the NL's 5–1 win. Following the All-Star break, Jurrjens went 0–1 with 
a 6.26 ERA in four starts. On August 6, the Braves placed him on the 15-day 
DL due to pain in his surgically repaired right knee. The move was retroactive 
to August 2.[19] He returned briefly, but did not play for the Braves in 
September.[22] Jurrjens got off to a poor start in the 2012 season, with 
an 0–2 record and a 9.37 ERA in his first four starts. On April 23, he 
was optioned to the Braves' Triple-A affiliate in Gwinnett, his first demotion 
in five seasons with the Braves. Atlanta's general manager, Frank Wren, 
stated that the move was intended to give Jurrjens the opportunity to work 
through his difficulties at the Triple-A level and get back on track pitching 
wise.[23][24][25] On June 22, 2012, Jurrjens was called back to the majors 
by the Braves after teammate Brandon Beachy injured his right elbow and 
underwent Tommy John surgery. He got his first win of the 2012 season against 
the Boston Red Sox.[26] He was not tendered a contract before the deadline 
on November 30, 2012, and became a free agent.[27] On January 24, 2013, 
Jurrjens agreed to a one-year deal with the Baltimore Orioles for $1.5 
million. Incentives could have brought the deal to $4 million.[28] However, 
after the Orioles reviewed Jurrjens' medical information,[29] they instead 
signed Jurrjens to a minor league contract.[30] Jurrjen's contract was 
purchased from the Triple-A Norfolk Tides on May 18.[31] He made his first 
start with the Orioles on that day, pitching 5 innings and picking up a 
no-decision, while the Orioles lost the game 6-10. He was optioned back 
to the Norfolk Tides on May 21,[32] and recalled on June 29.[33] He was 
optioned back to Norfolk on July 1. Jurrjens was designated for assignment 
by the Orioles on July 12 in order to clear room for Jairo Asencio.[34] 
Jurrjens opted for free agency instead of playing in Triple A, and became 
a free agent on July 18.[35] On July 24, 2013, Jurrjens was signed to a 
minor league deal bringing him back to Detroit. Jurrjens was quickly optioned 
to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens.[36] On May 20, 2014, Jurrjens signed a 
minor league deal with the Cincinnati Reds.[37] On July 2, 2014, Jurrjens 
was traded to the Colorado Rockies in exchange for minor league first baseman 
Harold Riggins.[38][39] Jurrjens made his 2014 season debut on July 4, 
making his first major league start since June 29, 2013,[40] pitching 4 2⁄3 
innings and allowing eight runs on twelve hits. After the start, Jurrjens 
was taken to the hospital, though his "breathing problem" had since ceased.[41] 
He was designated for assignment on July 21 and was resigned to a minor 
league contract.[42] Jurrjens elected free agency in October 2014, but 
was resigned by the Rockies to a minor league deal and began the year with 
the Rockies AAA affiliate the Albuquerque Isotopes.[43] He was released 
by the Rockies on August 28, 2015 after posting a 6.88 ERA in 17 games 
for the Isotopes.[44] Jurrjens signed with the Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions 
of the Chinese Professional Baseball League on February 13, 2016.[45] He 
was released in August.[46] Jurrjens has a four-seam fastball that he used 
to throw at 91–92 MPH, but by the 2012 season had dipped into the 87–90 
range. Jurrjens pairs his fastball with a changeup to lefties in the low
