Kenneth Wade Hill (born December 14, 1965) is a former Major League Baseball 
pitcher. During a 14-year career, he pitched from 1988–2001 for seven different 
teams. He pitched in the 1995 World Series as a member of the Cleveland 
Indians. He also appeared in the 1994 All-Star Game in Pittsburgh's Three 
Rivers Stadium. Hill graduated from Lynn Classical High School in 1983 
and later attended North Adams State College.[1] Hill was called up by 
the injury-plagued St. Louis Cardinals in 1989. He started well, but soon 
went downhill. He finished that season 7-15, but with a decent 3.80 ERA. 
He wouldn't see another decent season until 1991, going 11-10 with a 3.57 
ERA. In November 1991, he was traded to the Montreal Expos for first baseman 
Andrés Galarraga. It was as a member of these Expos that Hill found his 
groove. In both 1992 and 1994 Hill won 16 games, going 16-9 with a 2.68 
ERA in 1991 and 16-5 with a 3.32 ERA in 1994. Notably, the 1994 season 
was curtailed on August 12 due to the Major League Baseball strike, stranding 
him on pace for a 23-7 season. He was also an All-Star in 1994, pitching 
2 innings in relief and walking one, and finished second in Cy Young voting 
to Greg Maddux. He then returned to the Cardinals, where he suffered the 
same fate he endured in his first stint in St. Louis, winning only 6 games, 
losing 7, and posting a 5.06 ERA. He was then was traded to the Cleveland 
Indians for minor league prospects David Bell, Rick Heiserman and Pepe 
McNeal. He did well for the Indians, going 4-1 in the remainder of the 
regular season and 2-1 in the postseason. He filed for free agency in the 
1995 postseason and was signed by the Texas Rangers, tying for the team 
lead (along with Bobby Witt) with 16 wins and leading the Rangers to the 
postseason for the first time. In 1997, however, an injury sent him to 
the disabled list and greatly affected the rest of his playing career. 
He also played for the Anaheim Angels after being traded there later in 
1997 for Jim Leyritz. He performed poorly over the next two years, going 
13-17 and finally being relegated to the bullpen in 1999. He was released 
in August 2000 but signed by the Chicago White Sox, for whom he promptly 
gave up eight runs in three innings and was released two weeks later. He 
accepted a non-roster invitation from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 2001, 
and appeared in five games for them before being released, ending his major 
league career.[2] Hill currently resides in Southlake, Texas. His son, 
Kenny Hill, is a quarterback at Texas Christian University.[3] His other
