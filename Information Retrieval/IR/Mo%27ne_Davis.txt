Mo'ne Ikea Davis (born June 24, 2001)[3] is an American former Little League 
Baseball pitcher from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was one of two girls 
who played in the 2014 Little League World Series and was the first girl 
to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in Little League World Series history. 
She was the 18th girl overall to play, the sixth to get a hit, and the 
first African-American girl to play in the Little League World Series. 
She was also the first Little League baseball player to appear on the cover 
of Sports Illustrated as a Little League player. Davis is the daughter 
of Lamar Davis and Lakeisha McLean.[4] She has lived with her mother and 
stepfather, Mark Williams, since the age of six.[5] In 2008, Steve Bandura, 
who is program director for Marian Anderson Recreation Center in South 
Philadelphia, observed Davis playing football with her cousins and older 
brother. He noticed that "she was throwing this football in perfect spirals, 
effortless and running these tough kids down and tackling them."[6] Bandura 
asked her if she would like to come to a basketball practice. When she 
came to practice, Bandura asked her to watch the practice, but she wanted 
to participate. Bandura told The Philadelphia Tribune that "Her eyes were 
just glued on the drill and, when it came time for her turn, she went through 
it like she has been doing it a thousand times. I just knew right then."[6] 
According to the The Philadelphia Tribune, Davis became Bandura's best 
basketball player and the only girl on the team. She also began playing 
and excelling at baseball and soccer.[6][7] Bandura, together with other 
sponsors, helped Davis transfer to Springside Chestnut Hill Academy, which 
is a private girls' school.[6] Her mother, Lakeisha McLean, told the The 
Philadelphia Tribune that she was unaware that her daughter was so athletic.[6] 
In 2011, she was a point guard in basketball, a pitcher, shortstop, and 
third baseman in baseball, but she revealed that she started pitching when 
she was a substitute from outfielder, and mid-fielder for soccer.[6] As 
of August 2014, while notable as a Little League pitcher, she considers 
basketball her primary sport.[8] She aspires to become a WNBA player, and 
has expressed desire to play college basketball for the UConn Huskies of 
the University of Connecticut, despite not being formally recruited, and 
follow in the footsteps of Maya Moore, a UConn alumna who went on to play 
in WNBA.[9][10] In 2015 she released a memoir, Mo'ne Davis: Remember My 
Name.[11] That year she also teamed up with the brand M4D3 (Make A Difference 
Everyday) to design a line of sneakers for girls, with some of the proceeds 
going toward the Plan International’s Because I Am A Girl initiative, which 
has the goal of helping to lift four million girls in the developing world 
out of poverty.[11] At age 13, Davis threw a 70 miles per hour (110 km/h) 
fastball, while the average velocity in her age class was 63 miles per 
hour (101 km/h) to 73 miles per hour (117 km/h) range.[12][13] According 
to Will Femia, a 71 miles per hour (114 km/h) pitch (which was clocked 
during her August 15, 2014 game) is equivalent in reaction time at the 
plate for a batter to a 93 miles per hour (150 km/h) pitch on a full sized 
diamond.[14][15][16][17][18] She also threw a curve ball that gave "opposing 
hitters fits".[19][20] Davis relied more on the precise mechanics of pitching 
rather than strength.[2] According to John Brenkus of ESPN, Davis had a 
wind up and release point that never varied by more than 3 degrees.[2] 
Although her arm was 15% shorter than a major league pitcher's arm, she 
was able to deliver balls at over 70 miles per hour (110 km/h), due to 
the efficiency of the kinetic linking of her body parts. Her pitching was 
compared to the throwing motion of major league pitcher Jonathan Papelbon.[2] 
At the end of her throwing motion, her arm was moving forward at peak angular 
velocity of 2500˚/sec, which was over 80% of the peak angular velocity 
(3000˚/sec) of typical major league pitchers.[2] In 1972, Maria Pepe was 
the first girl to start in Little League games, but she was removed when 
opposing teams demanded her removal. The National Organization for Women 
filed suit for Pepe, and in 1973 Judge Sylvia Pressler ruled that "The 
institution of Little League is as American as the hot dog and apple pie. 
There is no reason why that part of Americana should be withheld from girls." 
Although the ruling came too late for Pepe to play, since she had turned 
14, the ruling made it possible for Davis and other girls to play Little 
League baseball.[21] Davis was the fourth American girl and 18th overall 
to play in the Little League World Series, out of almost 9,000 participants 
since the tournament began in 1947. The 2014 Little League World Series 
was also the first in which two girls participated.[22] Davis was also 
the sixth girl to get a hit in Little League World Series history.[23] 
On August 10, 2014, Davis pitched a three-hit 8–0 shutout over Newark National 
Little League of Delaware to get into the Mid-Atlantic Region of the Little 
League World series.[19][24] On August 15, 2014, Davis was the first girl 
in Little League World Series history to pitch a winning game for the Taney 
Dragons and earned the win,[22] and she was also the first girl to pitch 
a shutout in Little League postseason history.[12][25] She led her team 
to a 4–0 victory over Nashville. She pitched six innings, struck out eight 
batters, and gave up two infield hits. By the fifth inning, the Nashville 
pitcher had reached the 85-pitch limit in Little League baseball, but Davis 
had only thrown 44 pitches.[22] In the sixth inning, she struck out the 
first two batters, and the third batter was at the full count when she 
struck him out.[12] After the game, Pennsylvania governor Tom Corbett predicted 
that some day she would play in professional baseball.[12][23][26][27] 
ESPN's broadcast of the semifinals game in which Davis played on August 
20, 2014 brought a 3.4 overnight rating, which is currently an all-time 
high for Little League on ESPN.[28] After pitching the first shutout in 
postseason Little League history, she received congratulatory Twitter messages 
from Mike Trout, Marcus Stroman, Kevin Durant, and requests for interviews 
by television hosts such as Jimmy Fallon.[12][26] Rachel Maddow said that 
Davis was the "best new thing in the world".[14] She also was praised by 
Ellen DeGeneres, Billie Jean King, and Michelle Obama.[18] Davis told ESPN 
"I never thought at the age of 13 I'd be a role model. I always wanted 
to be a role model, but being a baseball role model is really cool."[26][29] 
She appeared on the August 25, 2014 Sports Illustrated front cover,[30] 
which made her the first Little League baseball player to appear on the 
front cover of a top US sports magazine as a Little League player.[31] 
Asked about appearing on cover of Sports Illustrated, Davis said "I don't 
know. Kind of surprised, but I mean, it was fun."[32] In 2014, Paul Graziano, 
who had been the Little League World Series press box announcer for the 
last 34 years, stated that he had never seen the level of excitement as 
early in the tournament and that this was partly due to the presence of 
Davis. The crowds cheered every time Davis pitches or was at bat, and she 
received standing ovations as she was pitching her shut-out win on August 
15, 2014.[33] On August 19, 2014, Mark Hyman, assistant professor of sports 
management at George Washington University, told The New York Times that 
"She's the most talked-about baseball player on earth right now".[32] According 
to The New York Times, Davis increased the ratings of ABC and ESPN and, 
as of August 19, Davis had appeared on the front page of the The Philadelphia 
Inquirer for five straight days.[32] Josh Peter, writing for USA Today, 
raised concern about the merchandising and marketing surrounding Davis' 
celebrity.[34] For example, on August 20, 2014, a baseball appeared on 
eBay, and the auction price was up to $510,[35] along with approximately 
40 other items supposedly autographed by Davis.[34] However, it was not 
just the autograph seekers who created problems for Davis. According to 
Peter, two companies were selling unauthorized Mo'ne jerseys.[34] In September 
2014, Davis donated her jersey to the Baseball Hall of Fame. She was accompanied 
by teammates from the Anderson Monarchs. Mamie Johnson, one of the three 
women to play in Negro league baseball was present at the event.[36] In 
October 2014, Davis was named one of "The 25 Most Influential Teens of 
2014" by Time magazine.[37] Also in October, a 16-minute documentary about 
Davis, entitled I Throw Like a Girl, directed by Spike Lee, and produced 
by Spike DDB for Chevrolet, was released.[38] On October 25 Davis threw 
out the ceremonial first pitch of game 4 of the MLB World Series at AT&T 
Park in San Francisco.[39] In addition, Davis was named Sports Illustrated 
Kids' "SportsKid of the Year" for 2014.[40] and was named one of ESPNW's 
Impact 25 in 2014.[41] In March 2015, a Bloomsburg University baseball 
player made a crude remark about her on Twitter and was suspended from 
future play. After he had made a public apology, Davis initiated a plea 
to the school, requesting that the player be reinstated. Bloomsburg University 
responded with the statement: "Her request demonstrates the type of person 
she is, her level of maturity and the empathy that her family and coach 
teach her. Bloomsburg University stands firm on our decision; however, 
his consequences will be reviewed as is common in disciplinary actions 
like this."[42] Davis was shown in Marie Claire magazine's "The 8 Greatest 
Moments for Women in Sports".[43] In July 2015 Davis won the Best Breakthrough 
Athlete ESPY Award.[44] In 2014, writing for CNN, Kelly Wallace suggested 
that Davis' accomplishments will affect both girls and boys, women and 
men.[31] In Wallace's view, she will inspire girls who want to play baseball 
in the future. To support this view, Wallace cited the case of Stephanie 
Tuck, who, as a girl, played on a Little League team. Tuck, recounting 
the experience of Little league play, said "I was heckled by the dads: 
'Get that girl off the field.' I used to literally pray the ball would 
not come to me in right field, as the pressure was so intense."[31] Wallace 
also wrote that Davis' play will remove the "specialness" of girls playing 
at the level of boys. In the future, fans will look at how good a player 
is, and gender will not be important.[31] For men and boys, Wallace argued 
that Davis' performance will reduce gender biases about the roles of boys 
and girls.[31] For example, "Throwing like a girl", according to Wallace, 
now has a completely different and positive meaning.[31] Melissa Isaacson, 
writing for ABC News, expressed similar views.[45] Wallace also speculated 
that the more attention female athletes such as Davis receive from girls, 
boys, men, and women, the more popular women's sports will become.[31] 
Finally, Wallace suggested that the tremendous interest that Davis has 
piqued in the Little League World Series might lead to increased participation 
of both boys and girls in baseball, which has suffered from major league
