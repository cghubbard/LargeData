Evan Michael Longoria[1][2] (born October 7, 1985) is an American professional 
baseball player. He played for the Long Beach State University baseball 
team, where he was the 2005 Cape Cod League MVP, and the 2006 Big West 
Co-Player of the Year. He was drafted by the Rays in the first round as 
the third pick overall in the 2006 MLB draft. After two full seasons in 
the minors, he made his major league debut for the Rays in 2008, and was 
named to the American League team for the 2008 MLB All Star Game. Longoria 
was also named the 2008 American League Rookie of the Year on November 
10.[3] Longoria has also made the All-Star team three times, being selected 
from 2008 to 2010. Longoria had one of the biggest hits in Rays history 
when he hit a walk off home run in extra innings of the last game of the 
2011 season, snapping a tie with the Red Sox in the race for the American 
League wildcard spot and sending his team into the postseason. Longoria 
is considered by many to be among the best active third basemen in baseball, 
winning the Silver Slugger Award in 2009. He is also known for his acrobatic 
defense, winning two Gold Gloves at third base in 2009 and 2010. After 
signing a ten-year, 100 million-dollar contract extension through 2022, 
he has been named by many as the Rays "face of the franchise" and owns 
many of the franchise's records, including the team record for most career 
home runs, doubles, and RBIs. Longoria has fielded almost every game of 
his career at third base. He has played at shortstop once.[4][5] Longoria's 
father is of Mexican descent.[6] He attended St. Raymond Catholic School 
in Downey, California. St. Raymond did not have a baseball team. He graduated 
from Saint John Bosco High School in Bellflower, California. He was a two-year 
letterman in baseball and as a senior was a first team All-League selection. 
Longoria did not receive any scholarship offers to play college baseball. 
USC was the only program to consider him, but eventually backed out of 
recruiting him. At 6-foot-1 and 170 pounds, many[by whom?] baseball recruiters 
felt Longoria was too slim by Division I baseball standards. As a result, 
he attended Rio Hondo Community College during his freshman season before 
Long Beach State offered him a scholarship.[7] After high school, Longoria 
attended Rio Hondo Community College, where he played shortstop. In his 
freshman season, Longoria earned first-team All-State honors and was offered 
a scholarship by Long Beach State University. He transferred to Long Beach 
for his sophomore year and hit .320, earning All-Conference honors. Because 
Long Beach State already had an established shortstop, Troy Tulowitzki 
(who now plays with the Toronto Blue Jays), Longoria played third base. 
Following a successful MVP summer in 2006 in the Cape Cod League with the 
Chatham A's where he played second base,[8] Longoria shared the Big West 
Conference Player of the Year honors (with Justin Turner) during his junior 
year at Long Beach State.[7] When he first started attending Long Beach 
State University, he majored in kinesiology. However, he switched to the 
department of Criminal Justice because it was somewhat less time-consuming 
and, therefore, would not interfere with the baseball schedule as much. 
In just two years, Longoria transformed his thin stature into a 6-foot-2 
and 210-pounds by the end of his LBSU tenure.[7] Longoria was selected 
by the Tampa Bay Rays as the third overall pick in the 2006 Major League 
Baseball draft. Longoria was called the "best pure hitter" among college 
players in the 2006 draft class by Baseball America.[9] He was the highest 
draft selection in school history. Tampa Bay gave him a $3 million signing 
bonus.[7] After signing with the Rays, Longoria tore through his first 
assignments in the minor leagues. After just eight games with the Single-A 
Hudson Valley Renegades, Longoria moved up to the Visalia Oaks and impressed 
the organization with his quick success, hitting .327 with eight home runs 
and 28 RBI in 28 games. This earned him a promotion to the Double-A Montgomery 
Biscuits, where he hit .267 with six home runs through the end of the season, 
and hit .345 in the postseason, including a walk-off two run home run in 
the Southern League Division Playoffs to put Montgomery into the championship. 
He was the 2007 Most Valuable Player with the Biscuits as well as a postseason 
all-star. On top of that he won a player of the week award.[10] He was 
widely considered the top third base prospect in the minors and one of 
the top prospects at any position.[11][12] Longoria followed up his successful 
debut with another stellar year in 2007. Starting the year with Montgomery, 
Longoria hit .307 with 21 home runs and 76 RBI in 105 games for the Biscuits 
before a late season promotion to the Triple-A Durham Bulls. In 31 games 
with the Bulls, he hit .269 with 5 home runs and 19 RBIs, but also had 
29 strikeouts. He finished 2007 with a combined average of .299, 26 home 
runs, 95 RBIs, and 73 walks for an OBP of .402. In October 2007, sportswriter 
Ken Rosenthal opined that Longoria "might be next season's Ryan Braun, 
making a rapid ascent to the majors."[13] Some scouts have in particular 
said that the way that the ball "explodes off his bat" reminds them of 
Braun. He was expected to start at third for Tampa Bay in 2008 with the 
move of Akinori Iwamura to second base, but ultimately failed to make the 
opening day roster and was optioned to Triple-A Durham. According to reports, 
the Rays elected to send him down to complete his development, citing his 
short 31 game stint in Durham and drawing comparisons to the seasons of 
two other highly heralded 3rd base prospects. On April 12, 2008, the Rays 
placed Willy Aybar on the disabled list and called up Longoria from Triple-A 
Durham to replace him on the major league roster and on the 40-man roster. 
Longoria made his major league debut that night going 1 for 3 with an RBI. 
Longoria hit his first career home run on April 14, against the New York 
Yankees at Tropicana Field. He had his first career two-homer game on May 
24, and drove in six runs as the Rays defeated the Baltimore Orioles 11–4. 
Both of the homers came off the Orioles' Steve Trachsel, also a Long Beach 
State alumnus. On July 19, 2008, Longoria hit his first career grand slam 
off Toronto's Roy Halladay in the fifth inning as part of a 6–4 winning 
effort. On April 18, the Rays signed him to a six-year, $17.5 million contract 
with options for 2014, 2015, and 2016. The first six years of the contract 
cover his arbitration years, with three more years added by team options. 
If the team exercises its one-year option for 2014, and then its two-year 
option for the 2015 and 2016 seasons, the deal could be worth up to $44 
million.[14][15] There is a general consensus that this contract is among 
the most team-friendly, in terms of dollars per Wins Above Replacement, 
in Major League Baseball.[16] On July 10, Longoria won the 2008 All-Star 
game AL Final Fan vote over outfielder Jermaine Dye of the Chicago White 
Sox, outfielder José Guillén of the Kansas City Royals, first baseman Jason 
Giambi of the New York Yankees, and second baseman Brian Roberts of the 
Baltimore Orioles. Longoria went 1–4 in the game and hit a game-tying ground-rule 
double in the bottom of the eighth inning. He also participated in the 
Home Run Derby that year. He hit 3 home runs.[17] On August 11, Longoria 
was placed on the disabled list with a fractured wrist.[18] On September 
18, Longoria had his first three home run game against the Minnesota Twins 
at Tropicana Field. On September 20, Longoria caught the game-ending out, 
from Joe Mauer in foul territory as the Rays clinched their first playoff 
spot in team history. On October 2, in the first postseason game for both 
Longoria and Tampa Bay, Longoria hit two home runs in his first two at-bats 
to help lead the Rays past the Chicago White Sox 6–4. Longoria is the first 
rookie and second player overall to homer in his first two postseason at 
bats. The first to do so was Longoria's hitting coach at Triple-A Durham, 
Gary Gaetti, who had his historic effort with the Minnesota Twins in 1987. 
On October 14, 2008, Longoria set the rookie mark for most home runs (4) 
hit in a postseason series, breaking Miguel Cabrera's record set in 2003. 
The Rays made it to the 2008 World Series (their first in franchise history) 
but were defeated by the Philadelphia Phillies. After the 2008 season, 
Longoria was honored with Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award for the 
American League,[19] as well as the American League Rookie of the Year 
Award. He became the fourth third baseman to win the award. He also became 
the sixth player and the first since Nomar Garciaparra in 1997 to win a 
Rookie of the Year Award unanimously.[20] He was also named the third baseman 
on the Topps Rookie All-Star Team. Longoria was called upon on March 19, 
2009, to replace Chipper Jones in the World Baseball Classic.[21] In April, 
Longoria knocked in his 100th career RBI, in his 135th game. The only then-active 
players to get to 100 RBIs more quickly were Ryan Braun (118 games) and 
Albert Pujols (131 games).[22] At the end of April, Longoria became the 
first player in Rays franchise history to be named the AL Player of the 
Month. He had also won two of the four Player of the Week awards for the 
month of April.[23] Longoria drove in 131 runs in his first 162 games in 
the majors, the third-highest total through May 2009 of any active player.[24] 
Longoria was selected by the fans to start the 2009 MLB All Star Game on 
July 5, 2009. Due to a finger injury, he was kept out of the lineup.[25] 
Longoria won the American League Gold Glove Award for his position on November 
10.[26] Two days later, he won a Silver Slugger Award.[27] In 2010, Longoria 
hit for the highest average of his career at .294 and was selected to play 
in the All Star Game for the third consecutive season. He performed well, 
getting a hit in his only official at-bat, in addition to having a walk 
and a run scored. Across the board, Longoria's 2010 season was statistically 
impressive, including 96 runs scored and 46 doubles as well as 5 triples. 
Surprisingly, though, his home run and RBI production fell from 33-113 
in 2009 to 22-104 in 2010. After the season, Longoria won the Gold Glove 
Award at third base for the second straight year. On September 28, 2011, 
Longoria hit a walk-off home run in extra innings against the New York 
Yankees to give the Rays an 8-7 victory, and more importantly, a spot in 
the playoffs.[28] Earlier in the month, the Rays were facing a deficit 
of nine games in the wild card race to the Boston Red Sox. However, an 
epic collapse of the Red Sox, where they went 7-20 in the final games of 
the year, and a surge of the Rays, allowed them to overtake the Red Sox 
and eliminate them on the final day of the regular season. Longoria's home 
run came just three minutes after the Red Sox suffered a walk-off loss 
to the Baltimore Orioles. "I always wanted to be kind of a benchmark player 
... the guy that you could think about or associate with the organization. 
My goal from day one was to be the first player that played their whole 
career here, to be the first guy that came into the organization and went 
out in the organization, and played all the years in between. There's no 
better place for me." On April 30, 2012, Longoria suffered a partially 
torn hamstring after sliding to second base when being caught stealing. 
His injury placed him on the 60-day disabled list as Longoria was expected 
to miss from 6–8 weeks. He missed 13 weeks and returned to the lineup on 
August 7, 2012. In the 85 games Longoria missed, the Rays earned a record 
of 41-44. The rest of the season, the Rays were 49-28, for a 63.6% winning 
percentage. On October 3, 2012, Longoria finished off the 2012 season with 
three home runs in the final game. On November 26, 2012, Longoria was signed 
to a 6-year, $100 million contract extension that could keep him in Tampa 
Bay through 2023.[30][31] On August 19, 2013, Longoria hit his 25th home 
run of the season, giving him his fourth 25-homer season, which tied him 
with Carlos Peña for the most such seasons in Tampa Bay history.[32] Longoria 
drove in his 500th career RBI after hitting a sacrifice fly vs. the New 
York Yankees on June 20, 2013, to plate Sean Rodriguez.[33] Longoria hit 
two home runs on September 25, 2013, vs. the New York Yankees at Yankee 
Stadium. These home runs gave him No. 30 and No. 31 on the year, also giving 
him his third career 30 HR season. The Rays won the game 8–3.[34] During 
the 2013 American League Wild Card tie-breaker game vs. the Texas Rangers, 
Longoria hit a two-run home run in the third inning. It would eventually 
be the go-ahead run, giving the Rays a fourth playoff berth in franchise 
history.[35] Some of his 2013 highlights included playing in the most games 
of his career with 160; he missed two with a foot injury. He had a walk-off 
home run vs. the San Diego Padres on May 11 when the Rays were down 6–7. 
It was his first walk-off home run since the Game 162 walk-off against 
the New York Yankees in 2011.[36] The 2014 season was Longoria's 7th season 
as a Major League player. On Opening Day, Longoria went 0-4,[37] but quickly 
got on pace and on April 4, 2014, Longoria hit the 163rd home run of his 
career to tie the Rays franchise record of most home runs, a record which 
was held for many years by Carlos Peña. During a 14-game stretch after 
his first home run, Evan had no home runs, until April 19, 2014, Longoria 
hit his career homer No. 164, shattering the all-time Rays record for home 
runs, passing Carlos Peña.[38] Longoria suffered a power stroke in the 
first half, going only .257 with 11 home runs and 44 RBI. On July 18, the 
Rays started the second half playing the Minnesota Twins after the All-Star 
Break (which was hosted by the Twins), and in the game, Longoria had a 
bases clearing double which would seal the win for the Rays. On July 20 
in the same series, Longoria hit a double off of Kevin Correia in the third 
inning, tying the franchise record in doubles, held by Carl Crawford with 
215. In the same game, he hit his second double of the game, driving in 
Matt Joyce, breaking the doubles record held by Crawford, along with tying 
the RBI mark on the team, also held by Carl Crawford.[39] Facing St. Louis 
Cardinals reliever Jason Motte, Longoria hit a solo home run off a 1-1 
fastball, making Longoria the team's all-time RBI leader.[40] On September 
2, Longoria hit his 200th career home run.[41] Longoria finished the season 
with a .270 average, 21 home runs, and 73 runs batted in over 160 games 
played.[42] Longoria was also a finalist for the Gold Glove Award at third 
base for the American League.[43] Longoria dominated in 2016, hitting .273 
with a career high 36 homeruns and 98 RBI's over 685 plate appearances. 
In the past Longoria has used "I'm Broken" by Pantera and currently is 
using "Down and Out" by Tantric as his at-bat music. The similarity of 
his name with actress Eva Longoria's has brought about playful comparisons 
between the two. Although both are Americans of Mexican descent, they are 
not related. When asked as a college baseball player in 2005 about the 
name similarity, he admitted that he got "ragged on it a lot, but I don't 
mind. My friends and I think she's hot."[44] However, when asked about 
it again in 2008, Evan said that he was "done talking about that. I did 
it all through the minor leagues. That's all I had to hear was her name 
associated with mine. I think we're kind of past that. That's all." After 
he was named to the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Eva sent 
Evan a bottle of champagne and a note thanking him for "doing the Longoria 
name proud".[45] In return, Evan sent Eva three signed jerseys. The name 
similarity between Evan and Eva has led to some heckling by opposing fans 
against him.[46][47] Evan Longoria was named the cover athlete for Major 
League Baseball 2K10, succeeding Tim Lincecum.[48] Longoria also appears 
in a commercial for the game that advertises the $1 million prize given 
to the first person to pitch a perfect game in MLB 2K10. In the commercial, 
Longoria breaks up a perfect game with a home run. On August 8, 2010, Longoria 
broke up a no-hitter in the 9th inning with two outs. Longoria spoiled 
Brandon Morrow's attempt with a putt-shot to the Blue Jay's second baseman, 
who was unable to make a play on it. Brandon Morrow was left with a 17 
strikeout one-hitter (which would have tied Nolan Ryan for most strikeouts 
in a no-hitter). He was featured in TV commercial for Gillette.[7] Longoria 
has also appeared in a commercial for New Era hats that was aired during 
the 2010 season. On March 8, 2011, his classic 1967 black and white Camaro 
RS, valued at $75,000 and a Buick GSX, valued at $25,000, were reported 
stolen from an Arizona lot. Longoria lives in California, but was having 
work done on the cars in Arizona.[49] On March 28, 2011, Longoria, David 
Price and Reid Brignac's rental property in Port Charlotte, Florida, was 
broken into, while they were away at the nearby Charlotte Sports Park stadium 
for a game. According to the St. Petersburg Times, police estimated $56,000 
in lost property from the burglary. Among the loot was Longoria's AK-47 
rifle.[50] Longoria is an avid self-taught drummer and even has a drum 
kit in Tropicana Field. He even owns a drumhead signed by members of Rush.[51] 
In February 2012, Longoria confirmed he was dating January 2010 Playmate 
of the Month Jaime Edmondson, who was also a contestant on the 14th season 
and the 18th season of The Amazing Race.[52] In December 2012, the couple 
announced that they were expecting a child.[53] The due date was reported 
to be April 1, 2013. However, Edmondson had labor induced six weeks prior 
at the advisement of doctors. She gave birth to a girl, Elle Leona Longoria, 
on the night of February 20, 2013.[54][55] Longoria and Edmondson married 
on December 31, 2015.[56] Longoria owns a restaurant in South Tampa called
