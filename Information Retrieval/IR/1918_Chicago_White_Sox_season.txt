Depleted of most of their stars due to World War I, the Chicago White Sox 
had a relatively bad year in 1918, going 57â€“67 and finishing in the second 
division. They had won the American League pennant in 1917 and would win 
another in 1919. Ace pitcher Eddie Cicotte led the AL in losses, with 19.
