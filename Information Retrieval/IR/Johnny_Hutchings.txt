John Richard Joseph Hutchings (April 14, 1916 – April 27, 1963) was an 
American professional baseball player, a right-handed pitcher who worked 
in 155 Major League games, mostly as a relief pitcher, for the Cincinnati 
Reds and Boston Braves during the 1940s. The native of Chicago stood 6 feet 
2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighed 250 pounds (110 kg). Hutchings' professional 
career began in 1935 and he reached the Majors after winning 22 games in 
1939 for the Pensacola Pilots in the Class B Southeastern League.[1] As 
a 1940 rookie playing for the defending National League champion Cincinnati 
Reds, he appeared in 19 games, including four starting assignments, for 
a team that ultimately won the 1940 world championship. Hutchings started 
one of the most tragic games in Cincinnati club history, the second game 
of a doubleheader on August 3, 1940, in Boston, against the "Bees" (the 
Braves' official name from 1936–40). Hutchings lasted only 1⅔ innings of 
the nightcap, and Boston won, 5–2, for a split of the twin bill.[2] Willard 
Hershberger, temporarily the Reds' starting catcher due to injury, had 
not reported to the ballpark for the day's doubleheader and stayed behind 
in his hotel room. During that second game, the Reds learned that Hershberger, 
despondent over what he perceived as his poor play, had committed suicide 
earlier that afternoon.[3] Hutchings worked in six more games during the 
regular season, and was on the Reds' roster for the 1940 World Series against 
the Detroit Tigers. He appeared in the eighth inning of Game 5, an 8–0 
Detroit victory, and allowed two hits, a wild pitch, and one earned run.[4] 
But the Reds went on to win the Series in seven games for their second 
Major League Baseball championship. On June 12, 1941, the Reds traded Hutchings 
to the Braves for veteran outfielder and future Baseball Hall of Fame member 
Lloyd Waner. Hutchings lost six of his seven decisions for the second-division 
Braves in 1941 and then was sent to the minor-league Indianapolis Indians 
of the American Association during 1942. Hutchings would become a stalwart 
member of the Indianapolis team, pitching for the Indians for eight seasons 
between 1942 and 1951, and compiling a win–loss mark of 59–37.[1] He also 
returned to the Majors with the Braves during 1944, near the height of 
the World War II manpower shortage. In his best MLB season, 1945 for Boston, 
he appeared in a team-high 57 games, 45 in relief and 12 as a starter. 
He won seven games and lost six, with three saves, three complete games 
and two shutouts. He also led the National League in home runs allowed 
with 21, including Hall of Famer Mel Ott's 500th blast on August 2.[5] 
Hutchings returned to the Indianapolis Indians in April 1946. During his 
Major League career, he allowed 474 hits and 180 bases on balls in 471 
innings pitched; he struck out 212. After his active career ended, he managed 
in the Chicago White Sox' farm system and coached for and briefly managed 
(in 1960) the Indianapolis Indians. He died in Indianapolis of uremia[6]
