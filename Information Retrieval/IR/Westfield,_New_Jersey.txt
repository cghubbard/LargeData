Westfield is a town in Union County of New Jersey, United States. As of 
the 2010 United States Census, the town's population was 30,316,[9][10][11] 
reflecting an increase of 672 (+2.3%) from the 29,644 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 774 (+2.7%) from the 28,870 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[20] According to a 2014 nationwide survey, Westfield 
is considered to be the 30th safest city to live in the United States.[21] 
The old village area, now the downtown district, was settled in 1720 as 
part of the Elizabethtown Tract. Westfield was originally formed as a township 
on January 27, 1794, from portions of Elizabeth Township, while the area 
was still part of Essex County, and was incorporated on February 21, 1798, 
as one of New Jersey's initial group of 104 townships by an act of the 
New Jersey Legislature. It became part of the newly formed Union County 
on March 19, 1857. Portions of the township have been taken to form Rahway 
Township (February 27, 1804), Plainfield Township (April 5, 1847), Cranford 
Township (March 14, 1871), Fanwood Township (March 6, 1878; now known as 
Scotch Plains) and Mountainside (September 25, 1895). The Town of Westfield 
was incorporated on March 4, 1903, replacing Westfield Township.[22][23] 
The name of the town is derived from its location in the western, undeveloped 
fields of the Elizabethtown tract.[24][25] According to the United States 
Census Bureau, the town had a total area of 6.743 square miles (17.463 km2), 
including 6.719 square miles (17.401 km2) of land and 0.024 square miles 
(0.062 km2) of water (0.36%).[1][2] Unincorporated communities, localities 
and place names located partially or completely within the township include 
Germantown.[26] Six municipalities border the town of Westfield: Mountainside 
to the north, Springfield Township to the northeast, Garwood and Cranford 
to the east, Clark to the southeast, and Scotch Plains to the west and 
southwest.[27] Westfield consists of two sides of the town, the North Side 
and the South Side. Neighborhoods include Brightwood, Country Club Estates, 
The Gardens, Indian Forest, Kimball Avenue Historic District, Manor Park, 
Stonehenge, Stoneleigh Park and Wychwood.[citation needed] The Westfield 
Memorial Library was founded in 1873 as the "Every Saturday Book Club" 
and has evolved over the past century into the Westfield Memorial Library 
of today. The Library is located in a large, modern, Williamsburg-style 
building at 550 East Broad Street. The library's collection consists of 
over 250,000 books, two dozen public computers, a wide array of multimedia 
options, a large youth services area with a vivid mural depicting Westfield 
history, and multiple tables and carrels for studying. The library offers 
classes for adults and children, storytimes for children, and computer 
instruction.[28] Westfield's downtown features many local and national 
stores, such as Lord & Taylor and several landmarks that were shown and 
used in the NBC network television show Ed such as the Rialto Theater. 
There are over 40 restaurants and casual dining establishments throughout 
the downtown. Downtown is located mostly north of the Westfield train station. 
The downtown area has a mix of independent stores and boutiques as well 
as national stores. Over one-third of the retailers and restaurants have 
existed for 25 years or more. Downtown Westfield, with over 200 retail 
establishments and 400 commercial enterprises, is a regional destination 
in New Jersey. The Downtown Westfield Corporation (DWC) manages the Special 
Improvement District (SID) area's growth and enhancement. The DWC participates 
in the National Main Street program associated with the National Trust 
for Historic Preservation. It is funded by a SID assessment on downtown 
properties and operates as the district's management agency. The DWC sponsors 
marketing efforts and promotions, special event planning, urban design 
and building improvement projects. The DWC works closely with the town 
government and volunteer groups to improve the downtown area. In 2004, 
Westfield won the Great American Main Street Award from the National Trust.[29] 
In 2010, Westfield was the winner of the America in Bloom contest for communities 
with a population of 25,001–50,000 against the other two towns entered 
in their category.[30] Shopping and dining in Westfield attracts citizens 
from other communities across the state. Several war memorials (including 
ones dedicated to the Korean War, World War II, and the Spanish–American 
War) are located in a plaza near the downtown. The plaza is also home to
