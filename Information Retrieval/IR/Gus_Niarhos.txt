Constantine Gregory "Gus" Niarhos (December 6, 1920 – December 29, 2004) 
was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League 
Baseball as a catcher for the New York Yankees (1946, 1948–50), Chicago 
White Sox (1950–51), Boston Red Sox (1952–53) and Philadelphia Phillies 
(1954–55).[1] Niarhos batted and threw right-handed, stood 6 feet (1.8 m) 
tall and weighed 160 pounds (73 kg).[1] A native of Birmingham, Alabama, 
Niarhos signed a contract with the New York Yankees as an amateur free 
agent in 1941.[1] He began his professional baseball career with the Akron 
Yankees at the age of 20.[2] Niarhos posted a .306 batting average in 112 
games, to help Akron win the 1941 Middle Atlantic League pennant.[2][3] 
In 1942 he moved up to the Binghamton Triplets of the Eastern League where 
he hit for a .278 average.[2] Niarhos joined the United States Navy in 
1943 and, was stationed at Quonset Point Naval Air Station in Rhode Island.[4] 
After the Second World War ended, Niarhos returned to the Yankees organisation 
in 1946, playing for Kansas City Blues of the American Association.[2] 
He made his major league debut with the Yankees on June 9, 1946 at the 
age of 25. Niarhos returned to the minor leagues in 1947 where he hit for 
a .321 batting average in 93 games for Kansas City, prompting Blues manager 
Billy Meyer to describe him as, "the best catcher in the organisation."[5] 
This was high praise in an organisation that included future catching standouts 
such as Yogi Berra, Sherm Lollar and Aaron Robinson. Niarhos returned to 
the major leagues in 1948, when he caught the majority of the Yankees games 
while Berra split time between playing the outfield and catching.[1] In 
his first full season with the Yankees, Niarhos led the team with a .404 
on-base percentage and had a respectable .990 fielding percentage.[6] On 
September 26, he suffered a fractured bone in his right hand which ended 
his season.[7] Niarhos began the 1949 season as the Yankees starting catcher 
however, by the end of the year, Berra had taken over the job as, the Yankees 
went on to win the American League pennant. In what would be the only post-season 
appearance of his career, Niarhos played in only one game of the 1949 World 
Series as a late-inning defensive replacement.[8] On June 27, 1950, the 
Chicago White Sox claimed Niarhos for the waiver price of $10,000.[9] He 
had a .324 batting average with a .408 on-base percentage in 41 games with 
the White Sox.[1] He served as a reserve catcher behind Phil Masi in the 
1951 season before being traded to the St. Louis Browns for Sherm Lollar 
at the end of the year.[10] One day later, the Browns traded him to the 
Boston Red Sox in exchange for catcher Les Moss.[10] He spent two seasons 
as a reserve catcher for the Red Sox before ending his major league playing 
career with the Philadelphia Phillies.[1] He was released after the 1955 
season, having appeared in only 10 games over two seasons with the Phillies.[1] 
Niarhos played for three more seasons in the minor leagues before retiring 
as a player in 1958 at the age of 37.[2] In a nine-season career, Niarhos 
played in 315 games, accumulating 174 hits in 691 at bats for a .252 career 
batting average along with 1 home run and 59 runs batted in.[1] He ended 
his career with a .988 fielding percentage.[1] Following his playing career, 
Niarhos was a coach for the Kansas City Athletics from 1962 to 1964. Afterwards, 
he became a minor league manager, leading the Burlington Bees to the 1965 
Midwest League championship and, then led the Modesto Reds to the 1966 
California League championship.[11][12][13] As a manager in the Athletics 
minor league system, he coached future stars such as Reggie Jackson, Vida 
Blue, Rollie Fingers, Tony La Russa, Gene Tenace and Catfish Hunter.[14] 
He later returned to his hometown of Birmingham to manage the Birmingham
