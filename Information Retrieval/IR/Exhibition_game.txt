An exhibition game (also known as a friendly, a scrimmage, a demonstration, 
a preseason game, a warmup match, or a preparation match, depending at 
least in part on the sport) is a sporting event whose prize money and impact 
on the player's or the team's rankings is either zero or otherwise greatly 
reduced. In team sports, matches of this type are often used to help coaches 
and managers select and condition players for the competitive matches of 
a league season or tournament. If the players usually play in different 
teams in other leagues, exhibition games offer an opportunity for the players 
to learn to work with each other. The games can be held between separate 
teams or between parts of the same team. An exhibition game may also be 
used to settle a challenge, to provide professional entertainment, to promote 
the sport, or to raise money for charities. Several sports leagues hold 
all-star games to showcase their best players against each other, while 
other exhibitions games may pit participants from two different leagues 
or countries to unofficially determine who would be the best in the world. 
International competitions like the Olympic Games may also hold exhibition 
games as part of a demonstration sport. In the early days of association 
football, known simply as football or soccer, friendly matches (or "friendlies") 
were the most common type of match. However, since the development of The 
Football League in England in 1888, league tournaments became established, 
in addition to lengthy derby and cup tournaments. By the year 2000, national 
leagues were established in almost every country throughout the world, 
as well as local or regional leagues for lower level teams, thus the significance 
of friendlies has seriously declined since the 19th century. Since the 
introduction of league football, most club sides play a number of friendlies 
before the start of each season (called pre-season friendlies). Friendly 
football matches are considered to be non-competitive and are only used 
to "warm up" players for a new season/competitive match. There is generally 
nothing competitive at stake and some rules may be changed or experimented 
with (such as unlimited substitutions, which allow teams to play younger, 
less experienced, players, and no cards). Although most friendlies are 
simply one-off matches arranged by the clubs themselves, in which a certain 
amount is paid by the challenger club to the incumbent club, some teams 
do compete in short tournaments, such as the Emirates Cup, Teresa Herrera 
Trophy and the Amsterdam Tournament. Although these events may involve 
sponsorship deals and the awarding of a trophy and may even be broadcast 
on television, there is little prestige attached to them. Frequently such 
games take place between a large club and small clubs that play nearby, 
such as those between Newcastle United and Gateshead. International teams 
also play friendlies, generally in preparation for the qualifying or final 
stages of major tournaments. This is essential, since national squads generally 
have much less time together in which to prepare. The biggest difference 
between friendlies at the club and international levels is that international 
friendlies mostly take place during club league seasons, not between them. 
This has on occasion led to disagreement between national associations 
and clubs as to the availability of players, who could become injured or 
fatigued in a friendly. International friendlies give team managers the 
opportunity to experiment with team selection and tactics before the tournament 
proper, and also allow them to assess the abilities of players they may 
potentially select for the tournament squad. Players can be booked in international 
friendlies, and can be suspended from future international matches based 
on red cards or accumulated yellows in a specified period. Caps and goals 
scored also count towards a player's career records. In 2004, FIFA ruled 
that substitutions by a team be limited to six per match in international 
friendlies in response to criticism that such matches were becoming increasingly 
farcical with managers making as many as 11 substitutions per match. In 
the UK and Ireland, "exhibition match" and "friendly match" refer to two 
different types of matches. The types described above as friendlies are 
not termed exhibition matches, while annual all-star matches such as those 
held in the US Major League Soccer or Japan's Japanese League are called 
exhibition matches rather than friendly matches. A one-off match for charitable 
fundraising, usually involving one or two all-star teams, or a match held 
in honor of a player for contribution to his/her club, may also be described 
as exhibition matches but they are normally referred to as charity matches 
and testimonial matches respectively. A bounce game is generally a non-competitive 
football match played between two sides usually as part of a training exercise[1][2] 
or to give players match practice.[3][4] Managers may also use bounce games 
as an opportunity to observe a player in action before offering a contract.[5][6] 
Usually these games are played on a training ground[7][8] rather than in 
a stadium with no spectators in attendance.[9] Exhibition fights were once 
common in boxing. Jack Dempsey fought many exhibition bouts after retiring. 
Joe Louis fought a charity fight on his rematch with Buddy Baer, but this 
was not considered an exhibition as it was for Louis' world Heavyweight 
title.[relevant? – discuss] Muhammad Ali fought many exhibitions, including 
one with Lyle Alzado. In more modern times, Mike Tyson, Julio Cesar Chavez 
Sr. and Jorge Castro have been involved in exhibition fights. Although 
not fought for profit, amateur bouts (usually) and sparring sessions are 
not considered to be exhibition fights. Prior to the 1917-18 NHL season, 
an exhibition game was played on 15 December, between the Montreal Canadiens 
and the Montreal Wanderers. The game was played as a benefit to aid victims 
of the Halifax explosion.[10] Under the 1995–2004 National Hockey League 
collective bargaining agreement, teams were limited to nine preseason games. 
From 1975 to 1991, NHL teams sometimes played exhibition games against 
teams from the Soviet Union in the Super Series, and in 1978, played against 
World Hockey Association teams also in preseason training. Like the NFL, 
the NHL sometimes schedules exhibition games for cities without their own 
NHL teams, often at a club's minor league affiliate (e.g. Carolina Hurricanes 
games at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, home of their AHL affiliate; 
Los Angeles Kings games at Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, California, 
home of their ECHL affiliate; Montreal Canadiens games at Colisée Pepsi 
in Quebec City, which has no pro hockey but used to have an NHL team until 
1995; Washington Capitals at 1st Mariner Arena in the Baltimore Hockey 
Classic; various Western Canada teams at Credit Union Centre in Saskatoon, 
a potential NHL expansion venue). Since the 2000s, some preseason games 
have been played in Europe against European teams, as part of the NHL Challenge 
and NHL Premiere series. In addition to the standard preseason, there also 
exist prospect tournaments such as the Vancouver Canucks' YoungStars tournament 
and the Detroit Red Wings' training camp, in which NHL teams' younger prospects 
face off against each other under their parent club's banner. In 1992, 
goaltender Manon Rhéaume played in a preseason game for the Tampa Bay Lightning, 
becoming the first woman to suit up for an all male pro sports team in 
North America. The Flying Fathers, a Canadian group of Catholic priests, 
regularly toured North America playing exhibition hockey games for charity. 
One of the organization's founders, Les Costello, was a onetime NHL player 
who was ordained as a priest after retiring from professional hockey. Another 
prominent exhibition hockey team is the Buffalo Sabres Alumni Hockey Team, 
which is composed almost entirely of retired NHL players, the majority 
of whom (as the name suggests) played at least a portion of their career 
for the Buffalo Sabres. American college hockey teams occasionally play 
exhibition games against Canadian college teams as well as against USA 
or Canadian national teams. (In men's hockey, the senior national teams 
are selected from NHL and other pro players, and college teams would be 
overmatched against those teams even if they were allowed to play them. 
However, the national under-18 teams are made up of amateurs, allowing 
college squads to play them.) The Major League Baseball's preseason is 
also known as spring training. All MLB teams maintain a spring-training 
base in Arizona or Florida. The teams in Arizona make up the Cactus League, 
while the teams in Florida play in the Grapefruit League. Each team plays 
about 30 preseason games against other MLB teams. They may also play exhibitions 
against a local college team or a minor-league team from their farm system. 
Some days feature the team playing two games with two different rosters 
evenly divided up, which are known as "split-squad" games. Several MLB 
teams used to play regular exhibition games during the year against nearby 
teams in the other major league, but regular-season interleague play has 
made such games unnecessary. The two Canadian MLB teams, the Toronto Blue 
Jays of the American League and the Montreal Expos of the National League, 
met annually to play the Pearson Cup exhibition game; this tradition ended 
when the Expos moved to Washington DC for the 2005 season. Similarly, the 
New York Yankees played in the Mayor's Trophy Game against various local 
rivals from 1946 to 1983.[11] It also used to be commonplace to have a 
team play an exhibition against Minor League affiliates during the regular 
season, but worries of injuries to players, along with travel issues, have 
made this very rare. Exhibitions between inter-city teams in different 
leagues, like Chicago's Crosstown Classic and New York's Subway Series 
which used to be played solely as exhibitions for bragging rights are now 
blended into interleague play. The annual MLB All-Star Game, played in 
July between players from AL teams and players from NL teams, was long 
considered an exhibition match, but as of 2003 this status was questioned 
because the league whose team wins the All-Star game has been awarded home 
field advantage for the upcoming World Series. Another exhibition game, 
the Hall of Fame Game/Classic which was played in Cooperstown, New York 
on the weekend of inductions to the Baseball Hall of Fame, was also ended 
in 2008 due to interleague play and teams playing only substitutes. National 
Basketball Association teams play eight preseason games per year. Today, 
NBA teams almost always play each other in the preseason, but often at 
neutral sites within their market areas in order to allow those who can't 
usually make a trip to a home team's arena during the regular season to 
see a game close to home; for instance the Minnesota Timberwolves will 
play games in arenas in North Dakota and South Dakota, while the Phoenix 
Suns schedule one exhibition game outdoors at Indian Wells Tennis Garden 
in Indian Wells, California yearly, the only such instance an NBA game 
takes place in an outdoor venue. Exhibition games have been also been held 
on occasion outside the U.S. and Canada. However, from 1971 to 1975, NBA 
teams played preseason exhibitions against American Basketball Association 
teams. In the early days of the NBA, league clubs sometimes challenged 
the legendary barnstorming Harlem Globetrotters, with mixed success. The 
NBA has played preseason games in Europe and Asia. In the 2006 and 2007 
seasons, the NBA and the primary European club competition, the Euroleague, 
conducted a preseason tournament featuring two NBA teams and the finalists 
from that year's Euroleague.[citation needed] In the 1998-99 and 2011-12 
seasons, teams were limited to only two preseason games due to lockouts. 
The annual NBA All-Star Game is an exhibition game. Women's National Basketball 
Association teams play up to three preseasons games per year. WNBA plays 
will play each other and will also play women's national basketball teams. 
Most years, the WNBA also stages an All-Star Game, but this game is cancelled 
if pre-emptied by major international competitions such as the Olympic 
Games. Traditionally, major college basketball teams began their seasons 
with a few exhibition games. They played travelling teams made up of former 
college players on teams such as Athletes in Action or a team sponsored 
by Marathon Oil.[12] On occasion before 1992, when FIBA allowed professional 
players on foreign national teams, colleges played those teams in exhibitions. 
However, in 2003, the National Collegiate Athletic Association banned games 
with non-college teams. Some teams have begun scheduling exhibition games 
against teams in NCAA Division II and NCAA Division III, or even against 
colleges and universities located in Canada. Major college basketball teams 
still travel to other countries during the summer to play in exhibition 
games, although a college team is allowed one foreign tour every four years, 
and a maximum of ten games in each tour. Compared to other team sports, 
the National Football League preseason is very structured. Every NFL team 
plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and 
two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, 
the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which 
are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping 
coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to 
the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is 
not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there 
are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason 
opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play 
these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, 
where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits 
their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition 
games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl 
in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type 
was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was 
eventually canceled). The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league 
opponents, with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last 
game against a team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College 
All-Stars) was held in 1976. Exhibition games are quite unpopular with 
many fans, who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home 
exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package. Numerous lawsuits 
have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member 
teams regarding this practice, but none have been successful in halting 
it.[citation needed] The Pro Bowl, traditionally played after the end of 
the NFL season (since 2011 is played the week prior to the Super Bowl), 
is also considered an exhibition game. The Arena Football League briefly 
had a two-game exhibition season in the early 2000s, a practice that ended 
in 2003 with a new television contract. Exhibition games outside of a structured 
season are relatively common among indoor American football leagues; because 
teams switch leagues frequently at that level of play, it is not uncommon 
to see some of the smaller leagues schedule exhibition games against teams 
that are from another league, about to join the league as a probational 
franchise, or a semi-pro outdoor team to fill holes in a schedule. Many 
college football teams, particularly larger organizations, play a public 
intramural exhibition game in the spring mainly to promote the team and 
give new recruits an early chance at public game action. Many of these 
intramural games are nationally televised, though not to the same level 
of prominence as intercollegiate play. In college sports the commonly used 
term for the major scrimmage at the end of spring practice is the "Spring 
Game." True exhibition games between opposing colleges at the highest level 
do not exist in college football; due to the importance of opinion polling 
in the top level of college football, even exhibition games would not truly 
be exhibitions because they could influence the opinions of those polled. 
Intramural games are possible because a team playing against itself leaves 
little ability for poll participants to make judgments, and at levels below 
the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), championships are decided by objective 
formulas and thus those teams can play non-league games without affecting 
their playoff hopes. High school football teams frequently participate 
in controlled scrimmages with other teams during preseason practice, but 
full exhibition games are rare because of league rules and concerns about 
finances, travel and player injuries, along with enrollments not being 
registered until the early part of August in most school districts under 
the traditional September–June academic term. Some states hold pre-season 
events known as "jamborees" in which several pairs of high school football 
squads take turns playing one half (usually 24 minutes of game time) to 
give players some experience before the first official game. Another high 
school football exhibition contest is the all-star game, which usually 
brings together top players from a region. These games are typically played 
by graduating seniors after the regular season or in the summer. Many of 
these games, which include the U.S. Army All-American Bowl and Under Armour 
All-America Game, are used as showcases for players to be seen by colleges 
and increase their college recruiting profile. Teams in the Canadian Football 
League play two exhibition games each year, in June. Exhibition games in 
the CFL have taken on great importance to coaching staff and players alike 
in that they are used as a final stage of training camp and regular season 
rosters are finalized after the exhibition games, which are generally referred 
to as "pre-season" play. During the amateur era, there were no rugby union 
competitions between national teams. Therefore matches between national 
teams are never considered "exhibitions", as they always have Test match 
status. However, test matches held before the Rugby World Cup are considered 
warmup matches. National teams sometimes play exhibition matches versus 
invitational teams like the Barbarian F.C. and Barbarian Rugby Club. Also, 
rugby union clubs sometimes play preseason matches. Australian rules football 
has been introduced to a wide range of places around Australia and the 
world since the code originated in Victoria in 1859. Much of this expansion 
can be directly attributed to exhibition matches by the major leagues in 
regions and countries where the code has been played as a demonstration 
sport. Various auto racing organizations hold exhibition events; these 
events usually award no championship points to participants, but they do 
offer prize money to participants. The NASCAR Sprint Cup Series holds two 
exhibition events annually - the Sprint Unlimited, held at Daytona International 
Speedway at the start of the season, and the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race, 
held at Charlotte Motor Speedway midway through the season. Both events 
carry a hefty purse of over USD $1,000,000. NASCAR has also held exhibition 
races at Suzuka Circuit and Twin Ring Motegi in Japan and Calder Park Thunderdome 
in Australia. Other historical examples of non-championship races include 
the Marlboro Challenge in IndyCar racing and the TOCA Touring Car Shootout 
in the British Touring Car Championship. Until the mid-1980s there were 
a significant number of non-championship Formula One races. The National 
Hot Rod Association Pro Stock teams will have a pre-season drag meet held 
before the traditional start in Pomona. The Pro Stock Showdown is a pre-season 
drag meet held for the Pro Stock teams held at The Strip at Las Vegas Motor
