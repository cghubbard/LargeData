Laurance Russell (Larry) Cheney (May 2, 1886 – January 6, 1969) was a starting 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Chicago Cubs (1911–15), 
Brooklyn Robins (1915–19), Boston Braves (1919) and Philadelphia Phillies 
(1919). Cheney batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Belleville, 
Kansas. Cheney debuted with the Cubs on September 19, 1911. After two appearances 
as a reliever, he pitched a shutout against Brooklyn, but was hit by a 
line drive off the bat of Zack Wheat which Cheney deflected with his throwing 
hand, fracturing his thumb and nose. The following season he relied heavily 
on a knuckleball and spitter after his broken finger took some speed off 
his heavy fastball. Then he blossomed, tying with Rube Marquard for the 
National League lead in wins (26), leading with 28 complete games, as he 
finished second in winning percentage (.722). In 1913 Cheney won 21 games 
(17 as a starter, four as a reliever) and led the league in saves (11) 
and games pitched (54). On September 14, he shut out the New York Giants 
while allowing 14 hits, setting a major league record for most hits given 
up while pitching a nine-inning shutout. He won 20 games in 1914, leading 
the league in starts (40) and games (50). From 1912 to 1914 he pitched 
300 or more innings in each season, with a career-high 311 in 1914. Also 
in 1914, Cheney set a record for most wild pitches in a season opening 
with 4 against the Cincinnati Reds on April 14. Traded to Brooklyn in August 
1915 for Joe Schultz, after an 8–9 start, Cheney won 18 games in 1916, 
helping his new team reach the World Series. He pitched three innings of 
relief against the Boston Red Sox in Game Four of the Series, striking 
out five batters. Cheney then pitched for the Robins, Braves and Phillies 
in 1919, his last major league season, appearing in his final game on September 
26. Over nine seasons, Cheney posted a 116–100 record with 926 strikeouts 
and a 2.70 ERA in 1881-1/3 innings. Cheney died in Daytona Beach, Florida
