Aurelio Rodríguez Ituarte, Jr. (December 28, 1947 – September 23, 2000), 
was a Mexican professional baseball player. He played as a third baseman 
in Major League Baseball for the California Angels (1967–70), Washington 
Senators (1970), Detroit Tigers (1971–79), San Diego Padres (1980), New 
York Yankees (1980–81), Chicago White Sox (1982, 1983) and Baltimore Orioles 
(1983). Rodríguez also played with the Obregon Yaquis and Cañeros de Los 
Mochis of the Mexican Pacific League. He batted and threw right-handed. 
A native of Cananea, Mexico, Rodríguez made his major league debut at the 
age of 19 with the California Angels in 1967. He was traded to the Washington 
Senators early in the 1970 season. Rodríguez went to Detroit with shortstop 
Ed Brinkman and pitchers Joe Coleman and Jim Hannan before the 1971 season 
in an eight-player trade that brought Denny McLain to the Senators along 
with Don Wert, Elliott Maddox, and Norm McRae. Rodríguez was a model of 
consistency at third base for the Tigers during the 1970s. Though a below-average 
hitter, he was sure-handed and blessed with a strong, accurate arm. In 
1976, he earned Gold Glove Award honors, becoming the first American League 
third baseman since 1959 to beat out Brooks Robinson. He made only 9 errors 
in 409 chances in 1976, leading all AL third basemen with a .978 fielding 
percentage. He again led AL third basemen in fielding percentage during 
the 1978 season. Playing for the Yankees in the 1981 World Series, he hit 
.417 (5-for-12). He played in his final major league game on October 1, 
1983 at the age of 35. Rodríguez was a .237 hitter with 124 home runs and 
648 RBI in 2,017 games. His most productive season was 1970, when he posted 
career highs in home runs (19), RBI (83), runs (70) and stolen bases (15). 
He played in the Mexican League as late as 1987, and coached in the minors 
for Cleveland. He returned to the Mexican League as a manager in 1995. 
On September 23, 2000, Rodriguez was visiting Detroit from his home in 
Mexico. While he was walking with an unidentified woman on Detroit's southwest 
side at 2:00 p.m., a car jumped the curb and ran over him. The woman driver 
of the car was driving with a suspended license and had been ordered not 
to drive due to a prior brain aneurysm; she was charged with felony manslaughter 
but received only probation. Rodriguez, who had to be pulled from under 
the car, was 52 at the time of his death. Thousands attended his funeral 
in Mexico, including the president of that country, Ernesto Zedillo. His 
tomb is located in the stadium Emilio Ibarra Almada, in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, 
and his cross stands atop that stadium. The picture on Aurelio Rodriguez's 
1969 Topps baseball card is actually a photo of Angels' batboy Leonard 
Garcia.[1] There have been three players in major league history named 
Aurelio (two of whom played for the Detroit Tigers), and all three were 
killed in car accidents between the ages of 44 and 53. See also Aurelio
