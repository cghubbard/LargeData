The Oakland Athletics' 1997 season was the team's 30th in Oakland, California. 
It was also the 97th season in franchise history. The team finished fourth 
in the American League West with a record of 65-97. The Athletics, coming 
off a surprising (if still mediocre) 78-84 campaign, hoped to reach the 
playoffs for the first time since 1992. With this in mind, the team traded 
for slugger Jose Canseco. Canseco, who had played for the Athletics from 
1986 to 1992, was reunited with fellow superstar (and fellow "Bash Brother") 
Mark McGwire. In addition to McGwire and Canseco, Oakland's impressive 
collection of power hitters included Jason Giambi, Ger√≥nimo Berroa, and 
Matt Stairs. Little was done, however, to shore up the Athletics' abysmal 
1996 pitching staff. Ariel Prieto, owner of a 4.41 career ERA (Earned Run 
Average), was named the Opening Day starter; a succession of poorly regarded 
players filled out the rest of the starting rotation and bullpen. While 
optimism remained high for the team's offense, great concern remained for 
its pitching staff. In the end, Oakland's offense and pitching both fared 
terribly. For the second consecutive year, no Athletics pitcher won ten 
or more games; even worse, no starter won more than six. None of the team's 
top four starters (Ariel Prieto, Steve Karsay, Mike Oquist, and Dave Telgheder) 
finished the season with an ERA of less than 5.00; the Athletics, as a 
team, finished with an earned run average of 5.48 (easily the MLB's worst). 
All told, the A's allowed a season total of 946 runs. This remains the 
worst such figure in Oakland history. More puzzling was the fate of the 
offense. Oakland, as expected, remained one of the league's best power-hitting 
teams. The Athetics' sluggers hit a total of 197 home runs (third-most 
in the American League). Oakland's home runs failed to generate much offense, 
however, as a low team batting average negated most of the team's other 
advantages. Oakland scored a total of 764 runs in 1997 (the 11th highest 
total in the American League). These awful performances quickly removed 
the A's from contention. On May 31, they were already nine games out of 
first place; their position steadily worsened throughout the summer. In 
light of this, General Manager Sandy Alderson traded Mark McGwire (who, 
at the time, was on pace to break Roger Maris' single-season home run record) 
to the St. Louis Cardinals for T.J. Matthews, Blake Stein, and Eric Ludwick. 
McGwire would finish the season with 58 home runs (four shy of breaking 
the record). The trade was a disaster on the Athletics' end, as none of 
the three players received in the trade remained on the team by 2000. The 
A's ultimately finished twenty-five games behind the first-place Seattle 
Mariners. Their 65-97 finish (the club's worst since 1979) led to the removal 
of Sandy Alderson as General Manager on October 17; he was replaced by 
Billy Beane. Manager Art Howe, however, was retained for the 1998 season. 
The 1997 season would ultimately prove the be the Athletics' nadir. The 
continued rise of Jason Giambi, the debuts of Ben Grieve and Miguel Tejada, 
the acquisition of Tim Hudson in the 1997 MLB draft, and the ascension 
of Billy Beane to the position of General manager paved the way for a lengthy 
period of success from 1999 onwards. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
