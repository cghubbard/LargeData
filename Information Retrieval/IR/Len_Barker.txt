Leonard Harold Barker III (born July 7, 1955)[1] better known as Lenny 
Barker or Len Barker, is a former Major League Baseball right-handed starting 
pitcher. He pitched the tenth perfect game in baseball history. Barker 
pitched for the Texas Rangers (1976–78), Cleveland Indians (1979–83), Atlanta 
Braves (1983–85) and Milwaukee Brewers (1987). During an 11-year baseball 
career, Barker compiled 74 wins, 975 strikeouts, and a 4.34 earned run 
average. Barker was a hard thrower, who early in his career struggled with 
his control. On April 16, 1978, at Fenway Park, Barker (then with the Texas 
Rangers) threw a pitch that sailed upward onto the screen above and behind 
the backstop. Partly due to this, he didn't make the majors for good until 
1979.[2] Barker's best season statistically was 1980, when he enjoyed career-highs 
in wins (19) and strikeouts (181, best in the American League). Barker's 
most notable accomplishment occurred on May 15, 1981 as a member of the 
Cleveland Indians.[1] On a cold, damp night in Cleveland, Barker pitched 
the tenth official perfect game in baseball history, defeating the Toronto 
Blue Jays, 3–0 (the game was originally reported as the ninth perfect game 
in major league baseball history[3] until the league later changed the 
criteria for recognizing a perfect game). The final out of the game was 
a fly ball caught by Rick Manning in short center field. Barker's pitching 
was so consistent that he never once reached ball three against any Blue 
Jay hitter. Barker's perfect outing, one of only twenty-three in the history 
of Major League baseball, is also the last no-hitter thrown by an Indian.[4] 
"I run into people almost every day who want to talk about it", Barker 
said in 2006. "Everyone says, 'You're probably tired of talking about it.' 
I say, 'No, it's something to be proud of.' It's a special thing."[5] Barker 
was selected for the 1981 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, held in 
Cleveland on August 9. The event was notable on two accounts: It was the 
first game played after a lengthy players' strike and gave Barker the opportunity 
to pitch two scoreless innings before 72,086 fans in his home stadium. 
During the 1983 season, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Brett Butler, 
Brook Jacoby, Rick Behenna and $150,000 cash.[1] The trade was initiated 
by the Braves, who were in a tight race for first in the National League 
West Division with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Barker pitched reasonably well 
down the stretch, notching a 3.82 ERA despite only going 1-3 in his six 
starts after the trade. After the season, the Braves signed Barker to one 
of the richest contracts for a pitcher in baseball history at the time--$4 
million over five years.[2] However, the Braves didn't get nearly enough 
in return. In 1984, Barker went 7-8 with a 3.85 ERA before missing the 
last two months of the season with an elbow injury. The next year, Barker's 
ERA ballooned to 6.35, and he only managed a 2-9 record. He was released 
at the end of 1986 spring training with three years remaining on his contract. 
He signed with the Montreal Expos a few weeks later and spent the season 
with their top affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians. The Expos released 
him during 1987 spring training, and he finished his career with the Milwaukee 
Brewers. Meanwhile, Butler and Jacoby went on to become All-Stars. After 
his playing career, Barker returned to the Cleveland area and founded a 
construction company with a business partner.[6] He and his wife Eva are 
the parents of Jared, Blake and Jacob. The Barker family currently resides 
in Geauga County east of Cleveland. Barker serves the head coach for Division 
II Notre Dame College in South Euclid.[7] Italics denotes post-season perfect game
