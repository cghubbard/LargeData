David Taylor Price (born August 26, 1985) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). Price was 
selected first overall in the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft by the Tampa 
Bay Rays and made his MLB debut in September 2008. He has also played for 
the Detroit Tigers and the Toronto Blue Jays. Price pitched out of the 
bullpen during the Rays run through the 2008 playoffs. Just weeks after 
his first appearance in the big leagues, he earned a memorable save in 
Game 7 of the ALCS, helping his club reach their first World Series. Price 
became a full-time starting pitcher in 2009. In his second full season, 
he was named the American League starter for the 2010 All-Star Game and 
finished second in the voting for the 2010 Cy Young Award. He won his first 
Cy Young Award in 2012 after a tight race.[1] The Rays traded Price to 
the Tigers during the 2014 season. When the Tigers fell out of the postseason 
race in 2015, they traded him to the Blue Jays, who won their division 
and advanced to the ALCS. That following off-season, the Boston Red Sox 
signed Price to a seven-year, $217 million contract. David Taylor Price 
was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, to Bonnie and Debbie Price.[2] He 
has two brothers.[2] He began playing baseball in his early childhood. 
He grew up as an Atlanta Braves fan and idolized outfielder David Justice.[3] 
He attended Cooperstown Dreams Park when he was a teenager. As a teenager, 
he was a standout on the Blackman High School baseball and basketball teams.[4] 
In his high school career, he compiled a 0.43 earned run average (ERA) 
and 151 strikeouts. He was the recipient of the Rutherford County MVP Pitcher 
(2003 and 2004), the Co-District 7AAA Pitcher of the Year with Michael 
Alcorn his senior season, and the Rutherford County Male Athlete of the 
Year in 2002, 2003 and 2004. He played in the 2004 High School All-America 
Game in Albuquerque, New Mexico.[2] Though Price was drafted in the 19th 
round by the Los Angeles Dodgers out of high school, he did not sign, and 
instead chose to attend Vanderbilt University on an academic scholarship.[5] 
He pitched for the baseball team for three seasons. In his freshman season 
in 2005, Price was honored as a Freshman All-American by both Baseball 
America and Collegiate Baseball. That year he went 2–4 with a 2.86 ERA 
in 19 games, compiling 92 strikeouts in 69 1⁄3 innings pitched.[2] Still, 
frustrated with his college workload, Price almost quit baseball to work 
at a McDonald's in his hometown but was talked out of it by his coach, 
Tim Corbin.[6] In 2006, Price posted a 9–5 record with a 4.16 ERA in 110 
1⁄3 innings pitched. He set a school single-season record in strikeouts 
with 155 while walking only 43 batters. Over a span of six starts early 
in the season, he recorded 10 or more strikeouts each game, including a 
17-strikeout performance in a game against Arkansas.[2] That year, he was 
one of five finalists for the Golden Spikes Award and a semifinalist for 
the Roger Clemens Award. He was also named to the third-team All-American 
by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association, first-team All-South 
Region by the American Baseball Coaches Association and second-team All-SEC 
by the coaches in that conference.[2] As a junior he tallied an 11–1 record 
with a 2.63 ERA. He was the nation's top strikeout pitcher, striking out 
194 batters over 133 1⁄3 innings, breaking his own school record. His last 
start against SEC competition came against Mississippi State in the SEC 
Baseball Tournament. Price pitched a complete game, going nine innings 
while giving up five hits, two runs, and striking out 11 batters with no 
walks. His last start at the college level came against Austin Peay in 
Vanderbilt's first game in the 2007 Nashville Regional. Against Austin 
Peay, Price retired 17 batters via the strikeout in nine innings of work 
while yielding just five hits, one run, and two walks. Price won several 
major national awards, including college baseball's top honor, the 2007 
Dick Howser Trophy,[2] and the 2007 Brooks Wallace Award. David Price was 
the first player to have a clean sweep of all the college baseball awards.[7] 
In the summer of 2005, Price pitched for the United States National Team. 
He went 2–0 with a 1.26 ERA in five games, tallying 39 strikeouts and 13 
walks over 28 2⁄3 innings. On August 2, 2005, he pitched a complete game 
shutout over Nicaragua, only allowing five hits. In the summer of 2006, 
Price helped the United States take home the gold medal in the World University 
Baseball Championship held in Cuba. In eight starts for the United States, 
Price was 5–1 with a 0.20 ERA.[2] Price signed his first professional contract 
on August 15, 2007. The six-year contract was worth $11.25 million ($8.5 
million guaranteed), including a $5.6 million signing bonus. After the 
contract was approved by the MLB, he was added to the Devil Rays 40-man 
roster before being optioned to the minor leagues to begin his career.[8] 
The total value of Price’s bonus was the largest in draft history. The 
signing bonus was second-largest in draft history, behind only the $6.1 
million Justin Upton received from the Arizona Diamondbacks as the top 
overall pick in the 2005 MLB Draft. The guaranteed value was the third-highest 
in draft history, trailing only Mark Prior ($10.5 million) and Mark Teixeira 
($9.5 million) from the 2001 draft. Price made his spring training debut 
against the Yankees, hitting the first batter and striking out the next 
three in one inning of work. His fastball averaged 98 mph.[citation needed] 
Price was first assigned to pitch for the Vero Beach Devil Rays of the 
Class A-Advanced Florida State League. He started six games for Vero Beach, 
compiling a record of 4–0. He had an ERA of 1.82 with 37 strikeouts in 
34 2⁄3 innings pitched. In his second start in Vero Beach, Price pitched 
against Pedro Martínez. After the game, Martínez said of Price: He's amazing, 
that kid. He's amazing... that kid is very mature for his time in [the 
pros], and very talented. That kid did a hell of a job of throwing first-pitch 
strikes and pounding the strike zone and jamming hitters. I was watching 
that. He did it like a big leaguer. He had such a command. Right there, 
I'm challenging you. I'm going to do what I gotta do without any fear. 
That's the kind of talent you love to see.[8] After moving up through the 
Rays minor league system to the Montgomery Biscuits of the Class AA Southern 
League in July, Price was promoted to the Durham Bulls of the Class AAA 
International League on August 9, 2008. After compiling an 11–0 combined 
record at Single-A and Double-A, Price received his first professional 
loss in his first start at Triple-A Durham. Price made his major league 
debut with the Tampa Bay Rays on September 14, 2008, against the Yankees. 
The first MLB hit he allowed was a home run by New York Yankees shortstop 
Derek Jeter; Jeter would later record his 3,000th hit by again homering 
off Price in 2011. Price pitched 5 1⁄3 innings of relief; he made his first 
major league start with the Rays on September 22, 2008, against the Baltimore 
Orioles. He was the winning pitcher in Game 2 of the 2008 ALCS against 
the Boston Red Sox, earning a post-season victory before winning a regular 
season game. Price recorded the final four outs in Game 7 of the 2008 ALCS, 
earning his first career save (regular season or postseason; postseason 
statistics are recorded separately) and eliminating the defending champion 
Red Sox. Price then pitched 2 1⁄3 innings in Game 2 of the 2008 World Series 
against the Philadelphia Phillies; he gave up two earned runs but nevertheless 
earned his second postseason save. The next day, Price introduced Barack 
Obama at a campaign rally in Tampa.[9] On May 30, 2009, Price collected 
his first major league regular season win in a 5–2 victory over the Minnesota 
Twins in which he struck out 11 in under 6 innings. He finished the season 
with a 10–7 record, a 4.42 ERA, 102 strikeouts, and 54 walks in 23 starts. 
In the 2010 season, Price was the first American League pitcher to reach 
10 wins, on June 15. On that date, he was 10–2 and led the league with 
a 2.31 ERA. Price was selected as the American League starting pitcher 
for the 2010 All-Star Game.[10] He finished the 2010 season tied for second 
in the American League (with Jon Lester) in wins (19) and in third place 
in ERA (2.72). He was eighth in the league in strikeouts with 188. He lost 
Games 1 and 5 of the 2010 American League Division Series against Cliff 
Lee and the Texas Rangers. During a game against the Yankees on July 9, 
2011, Price allowed a home run to Derek Jeter, which was Jeter's 3,000th 
career hit. Price finished 2011 with a 12–13 record, 218 strikeouts, and 
a 3.49 ERA in 34 games started. In 2012, Price went 20–5 on the season 
(tying for the league lead in wins) with a league-leading 2.54 ERA, two 
main reasons why he won the AL Cy Young Award. Price pitched a complete 
game shutout against the Los Angeles Angels on April 24, 2012, with the 
final score 5–0.[11] Price pitched in the 2012 MLB All-Star Game. Price 
got his 20th win against the Chicago White Sox on September 30, making 
him the first 20-win pitcher in Rays franchise history. In recording the 
win, he became the youngest American League pitcher (aged 27) to earn 20 
wins in a season since 2004.[12] In 2013, Price went 10-8 on the season 
with a 3.33 ERA, and had an American League leading and career-best four 
complete games. In the 2013 American League Wild Card tie-breaker against 
the Texas Rangers, Price pitched a complete game to lead the Rays into 
the postseason. From June 4 to 25, Price had five consecutive starts with 
at least ten strikeouts, becoming only the eighth pitcher in major league 
history to do so.[13] On July 6, Price was named to his fourth All-Star 
team; he did not participate in this All-Star game due to pitching in a 
game two days prior, avoiding pitching on only one day of rest.[14] He 
was replaced by Fernando Rodney.[15] Before a July 31 trade to the Detroit 
Tigers, Price had a record of 11–8, with a 3.11 ERA, 189 strikeouts, and 
23 walks in 23 starts with the Rays.[16] On July 31, Price was traded to 
the Detroit Tigers in a three-team deal that sent Drew Smyly, Nick Franklin 
and Willy Adames to the Tampa Bay Rays, and Austin Jackson to the Seattle 
Mariners.[17] In his Tigers debut against the New York Yankees on August 
5, Price pitched 8 2⁄3 innings, allowing three runs, striking out ten, 
and walking none.[18] On August 21, in his first game against his former 
team, the Tampa Bay Rays, Price allowed one hit and an unearned run with 
one out in the first inning, then retired the final 23 batters he faced, 
but suffered a complete game loss. Price is the first pitcher in the major 
leagues to lose a complete game, one-hitter or better, with no earned runs 
since Andy Hawkins lost a no-hitter for the New York Yankees on July 1, 
1990. It was the first time since 1914 that a pitcher has lost a complete 
game, one-hit, no walk start without allowing an earned run.[19] On August 
27, in a game against the Yankees, Price allowed eight runs and twelve 
hits, including nine straight in the third inning of an 8–4 loss. He is 
the first pitcher since Bob Forsch in 1989 to allow nine straight hits. 
Only three previous times in major league history had a pitcher allowed 
12 hits in two innings or fewer. The others being Shawn Estes in 2003, 
Johnny Podres in 1963 and George Uhle in 1929.[20] With the Tigers, Price 
went 4–4 over the final two months of the season, with a 3.59 ERA and 82 
strikeouts in 77 2⁄3 innings. On September 28, the last day of the regular 
season, Price pitched 7 1⁄3 shutout innings against the Minnesota Twins, 
giving up four hits, striking out eight, and earning the 3–0 win, to help 
the Tigers clinch their fourth consecutive AL Central Division title.[21] 
Price finished the 2014 regular season with a 15–12 record, 3.26 ERA and 
1.08 WHIP. He led all of major league baseball in innings pitched ( 248 1⁄3), 
batters faced (1,009) and strikeouts (271).[22] On January 16, 2015, Price 
and the Tigers avoided arbitration agreeing on a $19.75 million salary 
for the 2015 season, setting a record for the largest one-year deal for 
an arbitration-eligible player prior to free agency.[23] Price was named 
the Tigers opening day starter for 2015 by manager Brad Ausmus, ending 
teammate Justin Verlander's streak of seven consecutive opening day starts. 
He responded by pitching 8 2⁄3 shutout innings in the Tigers 4–0 win over 
the Minnesota Twins.[24] On July 6, 2015, Price was named to the 2015 All-Star 
Game, his fifth such honor.[25] Price pitched a scoreless fourth inning 
in the game, striking out two, and earning the win for the AL.[26] He entered 
the All-Star Break with a 9–2 record, 2.38 ERA and 115 strikeouts. On July 
30, 2015, Price was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for Daniel Norris, 
Matt Boyd and Jairo Labourt.[27] Price made his debut for the Blue Jays 
on August 3. He threw 119 pitches through 8 innings, recording 11 strikeouts 
& a winning decision, while yielding only 3 hits, 2 walks, and 1 earned 
run in a 5-1 victory over the Minnesota Twins at Rogers Centre. His 11 
strikeouts tied José Núñez's team record for most strikeouts in a Blue 
Jays' pitching debut.[28] On September 5, Price earned his 100th career 
win, by beating the Baltimore Orioles 5–1.[29] He was scratched from his 
final start of the season on October 1, as the Blue Jays had clinched the 
AL East the day prior.[30] Price made 11 starts for the Blue Jays in 2015, 
and went 9–1 with a 2.30 ERA and 87 strikeouts in 74 1⁄3 innings.[31] Price 
started Game 1 of the ALDS for the Blue Jays, taking the loss and bringing 
his career postseason record to 1–6. He would earn his second career postseason 
win on October 12, pitching 3 innings in relief of R.A. Dickey's game 4 
start. Price finished the 2015 season with an 18–5 record and a 2.45 ERA. 
Price finished second in Cy Young Award balloting to Dallas Keuchel.[32] 
On December 4, 2015, Price signed a seven-year, $217 million contract with 
the Boston Red Sox.[33][34] Price recorded a win in his debut with the 
Red Sox on April 5, 2016.[35] Price's first season was markedly different 
from the first to second half. In his first 18 starts, Price compiled an 
8-6 record with a 4.64 ERA. He finished the season at 3.99 ERA with a 17-9 
record. He led the AL with 230.0 IP and 227 hits allowed. 228 Strikeouts 
also marked his second highest in his career, after his 2014 season split 
between Tampa and Detroit. Price uses a wide variety of pitches and complements 
them with excellent velocity. He throws two fastballs in the 93–96 mph 
range (tops out at 98 mph), a four-seamer and a two-seamer. His two-seamer 
is his lead pitch against right-handed and left-handed hitters, although 
he uses it more often against lefties. Price also throws a cutter at 90-92 mph, 
used mainly against right-handed hitters (especially in 2-strike counts). 
He rounds out his repertoire with a changeup he uses against right-handed 
hitters exclusively (83–86) and a spike curveball at 78–81.[36][37] Price 
tends to set the pace early in games, taking 5–7 seconds to pitch the ball
