The Tulsa Drillers are a minor league baseball team based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
The team, which plays in the Texas League, is the Double-A affiliate of 
the Los Angeles Dodgers major-league club. The Drillers play at ONEOK Field 
(pronounced "one-oak"), in downtown Tulsa's Greenwood district. The team 
previously played at Drillers Stadium on the Tulsa County Fairgrounds at 
15th and Yale in midtown Tulsa. The Drillers held their first home opener 
at ONEOK Field on April 8, 2010, losing 7–0 to the Corpus Christi Hooks 
in front of an over-capacity crowd of 8,665.[1] In their first season in 
the new ballpark, the Drillers drew total attendance of 408,183, the highest 
season figure in the history of Tulsa professional baseball.[2] The Drillers 
came into being in 1977, when the two-year-old Lafayette Drillers were 
moved to Tulsa. Before that time, the Triple-A Tulsa Oilers had been the 
city's minor league club, but owner A. Ray Smith moved that team to New 
Orleans due to concerns over the dilapidated condition of Oiler Park. The 
new team opted to keep the Drillers name carried over from Lafayette—appropriate 
given the importance of oil to the Tulsa economy. The Drillers set up shop 
at Oiler Park, which was renamed Driller Park. However, it was obvious 
that the old stadium was at the end of its useful life, and plans were 
already underway for a replacement. Tulsa County completed 8,000 seat Robert 
B. Sutton Stadium in 1981, naming it for its chief benefactor, a local 
oil executive. Sutton, however, was convicted in 1982 of fraud, and as 
a result the County renamed the park Tulsa County Stadium, and renamed 
it Drillers Stadium in 1989. From 1976 to 2002, the Drillers were the Double-A 
affiliate of the Texas Rangers. In 2002, Rangers owner Tom Hicks purchased 
the Shreveport, Louisiana Texas League franchise with the intention of 
moving the team to Frisco, Texas, a suburban city north of Dallas, Texas. 
At the time, the Shreveport Swamp Dragons were affiliated with the San 
Francisco Giants; Hicks cast aside this association and bought out the 
remaining two years of Tulsa's Player Development Contract. The Drillers 
then signed a two-year agreement with the Colorado Rockies. After the 2014 
season they signed an affiliation agreement with the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
Batting coach Mike Coolbaugh was killed in a freak accident on July 22, 
2007. While standing in the first base coach box, he was hit in the head 
by a line drive.[3] Although CPR was administered at the scene, he died 
less than an hour later. The Drillers and Travelers suspended their game, 
which the Travelers had been leading, 7–3, in the ninth inning. The Drillers 
also postponed their game the following night.[4] The coroner concluded 
that Coolbaugh was actually hit in the neck with the line drive instead 
of the head, which ruptured an artery in his neck, killing him.[5] The 
Drillers have been Texas League champions three times: in 1982, 1988, and 
1998. As well as Eastern Division Champions in 1999, and 2002. The Drillers 
also appeared in the Texas League playoffs during the 2004, 2005, 2006, 
and 2007 seasons. Tulsa businessman Bill Rollings acquired the Lafayette 
franchise and moved it to Tulsa in 1977.[6][7] Country music entertainer 
Roy Clark was a co-owner of the team for six years.[8] Went Hubbard bought 
the team in 1986. In March 2006, Chuck Lamson (a former Drillers pitcher 
and executive) bought out much of Hubbard's stock in the team; Lamson became 
president and majority owner of the team.[9] In December 2010, Lamson sold 
his stock back to Hubbard. This transaction made Hubbard the sole owner 
of the team; his sons, Dale and Jeff, became co-chairmen. Went and Dale 
Hubbard are residents of Walpole, New Hampshire; Jeff Hubbard, a former 
player (in 1987) and coach (in 1991) for the Drillers, lives in Durham, 
North Carolina.[10] Went Hubbard died in September 2012.[11] ESPN SportsCenter 
anchor John Anderson has often alluded to team alumni as "former Driller(s)" 
on-air. Anderson was a weekend sports anchor for Tulsa CBS affiliate KOTV 
before joining ESPN.[12] For 13 years the Tulsa Drillers' radio (and sometime 
television) announcer was Mark Neely, but in January 2009 it was announced 
that Neely had been hired to be the new TV play-by-play announcer for the 
San Diego Padres.[13] In February the Drillers announced that Neely's replacement 
would be Dennis Higgins, former announcer for the Wichita Wranglers.[14] 
Since the 2005 season, the Drillers have been broadcast on KTBZ (AM), Sports 
Radio 1430, "The Buzz" in Tulsa.[15] Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders
