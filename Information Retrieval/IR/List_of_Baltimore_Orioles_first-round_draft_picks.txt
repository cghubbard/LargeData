The Baltimore Orioles are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in Baltimore, Maryland. They play in the American League East division. 
Since the institution of MLB's Rule 4 Draft, the Orioles have selected 
58 players in the first round. Officially known as the "First-Year Player 
Draft",[1] the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary mechanism for assigning amateur 
baseball players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball 
clubs to its teams. The draft order is determined based on the previous 
season's standings, with the team possessing the worst record receiving 
the first pick.[1] In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous 
off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.[2] Of the 
58 players picked in the first round by Baltimore, 30 have been pitchers, 
the most of any position; 21 of them were right-handed, while 9 were left-handed. 
Eleven outfielders, eight shortstops, six catchers, two third basemen, 
and one second basemen were also taken. The team has never drafted a player 
at first base.[3] 16 of the players came from high schools or universities 
in the state of California, and Florida follows with five players.[3] The 
Orioles have also drafted two players from Canada, Ntema Ndungidi (1997) 
and Adam Loewen (2002).[3] The Orioles have not drafted any players from 
their home state of Maryland.[3] Two players have won a championship with 
the team; Bobby Grich (1967), who was a part of the 1970 World Series championship 
team, and Rich Dauer (1974), who was a part of the 1983 World Series championship 
team.[4][5] None of the Orioles' first-round picks have been elected to 
the Baseball Hall of Fame. One pick, Gregg Olson (1988), has won the MLB 
Rookie of the Year Award; he won the award in 1989.[6] The Orioles had 
the first overall selection once in the draft, which they used on Ben McDonald 
(1989). Jayson Werth (1997) was originally drafted as a catcher, but was 
converted to a right fielder, and primarily plays that position in the 
major leagues.[7] The Orioles have made 11 selections in the supplemental 
round of the draft and six compensatory picks since the institution of 
the First-Year Player Draft in 1965.[3] These additional picks are provided 
when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season,[2][8][V] 
or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous 
year.[9] The Orioles have failed to sign two of their first-round picks, 
Brad DuVall (1987) and Wade Townsend (2004). They received the 28th pick 
in 1988 and the 48th pick in 2005 for failing to sign DuVall and Townsend,
