The Mexican Pacific League (Spanish: Liga Mexicana del Pac√≠fico or LMP) 
is an independent winter baseball league in Mexico. The eight-team league 
regular season runs from October to December and is followed by a playoff 
series in January to determine the league champion. The league's winner 
takes part in the Caribbean Series each year. Founded in 1945, the league 
was previously known as the Liga Invernal de Sonora (English: Sonora Winter

adopting its present name in 1970.[1] Although not officially recognized 
by Minor League Baseball, it is probably a stronger organization than a 
number of circuits in the United States[citation needed]. Teams in gold
