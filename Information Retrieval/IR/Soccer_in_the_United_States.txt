Soccer in the United States is governed by the United States Soccer Federation, 
commonly known as U.S. Soccer. The organization governs most levels of 
soccer in the country, including the national teams, professional leagues, 
and the amateur game with the exception of college and high school soccer. 
With over 13 million Americans playing soccer in the United States, soccer 
is the third most played team sport in the U.S., behind only basketball 
and baseball/softball.[7] The popularity of soccer in the U.S. has been 
growing since the 1960s and 1970s, and received a significant boost when 
the United States hosted the 1994 World Cup. In the United States, the 
sport of association football is mainly referred to as "soccer", as the 
term "football" is primarily used to refer to the sport of American football.[8] 
The highest professional soccer league in the U.S. in the 1970s and 1980s 
was the North American Soccer League. Currently it is the Major League 
Soccer, which began play in 1996 with 10 teams, and has grown to 20 teams 
(17 in the United States and 3 in Canada), with further expansion planned. 
The MLS season runs from March to December, with the regular-season winner 
awarded the Supporters' Shield and the post-season winner awarded the MLS 
Cup. With an average attendance of over 20,000 per game, MLS has the third 
highest average attendance of any sports league in the U.S.,[9] and is 
the seventh highest attended professional soccer league worldwide.[10] 
Soccer fans also follow the U.S. national teams in international competition. 
The 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup Final drew a record 26.7 million viewers, 
greater than final games of the 2014 World Series or the 2015 NBA Finals, 
and the 2010 Men's World Cup final drew 26.5 million viewers.[11] The men's 
national team has played in every World Cup since 1990, and the women's 
national team has won three Women's World Cup titles and four gold medals 
at the Summer Olympics. There has been some debate about the origins of 
modern soccer in America. It has long been held that the modern game entered 
the States through Ellis Island in the 1860s. However, 2013 research has 
shown that soccer entered America through the port of New Orleans, as Irish, 
English, Scottish, and German immigrants brought the game with them. It 
was in New Orleans that many of the first games of soccer in America were 
held.[12] The origins of the game in general trace back to ancient Greece, 
Rome, Egypt, or China. It is difficult to say for sure which country was 
the true origin. [13] Oneida Football Club has been named as the first 
association football club in the United States but there is still discussion 
on what rules the club used, and it broke up within the space of a few 
years.[14] According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the club is often credited 
with inventing the "Boston Game", which allowed players to both kick a 
round ball along the ground, and to pick it up and run with it. The first 
U.S. match known to have been inspired by FA rules was a game between Princeton 
University and Rutgers University on November 6, 1869, which was won by 
Rutgers, 6–4. The FA rules were followed in the Princeton–Rutgers contest: 
participants were only allowed to kick the ball and each side had 25 players. 
Other colleges emulated this development, but all of these were converted 
to rugby by the mid-1870s and would soon become famous as early bastions 
of American football.[15] The earliest examples of governance in the sport 
started in 1884, when the American Football Association (AFA) was incarnated. 
The AFA sought to standardize rules for the local soccer teams based in 
the Northeastern United States, particularly in northern New Jersey and 
southern New York state. By 1886, the AFA had spread in influence into 
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.[16] Within a year of its founding, the 
AFA organized the first non-league cup in American soccer history, known 
as the American Cup. For the first dozen years, clubs from New Jersey and 
Massachusetts dominated the competition. It would not be until 1897 that 
a club from outside those two states won the American Cup. Philadelphia 
Manz brought the title to Pennsylvania for the first time. Due to conflicts 
within the AFA, the cup was suspended in 1899, and it was not resumed until 
1906. Early soccer leagues in the U.S. mostly used the name "football", 
for example: the AFA (founded in 1884), the American Amateur Football Association 
(1893), the American League of Professional Football (1894), the National 
Association Foot Ball League (1895), and the Southern New England Football 
League (1914). Common confusion between the terms American football and 
association football eventually led to a more domestic widespread use of 
the term soccer with regard to association football. Originally seen as 
a British slang term for "association", the use of soccer began appearing 
in the late 1910s and early 1920s. A noticeable example was the American 
Soccer League (ASL), which formed in 1919. The governing body of the sport 
in the U.S. did not have the word soccer in its name until 1945, when it 
became the United States Soccer Football Association. It did not drop the 
word football from its name until 1974, when it became the United States 
Soccer Federation, often going simply as U.S. Soccer. In October 1911, 
a competing body, the American Amateur Football Association (AAFA) was 
created. The association quickly spread outside of the Northeast and created 
its own cup in 1912, the American Amateur Football Association Cup. The 
conflicts within the AFA led to a movement to create a truly national body 
to oversee American soccer. In 1913, both the AAFA and AFA applied for 
membership in FIFA, the international governing body for soccer. Drawing 
on both its position as the oldest soccer organization and the status of 
the American Cup, the AFA argued that it should be the nationally recognized 
body. Later that year, the AAFA gained an edge over the AFA when several 
AFA organizations moved to the AAFA. On April 5, 1913, the AAFA reorganized 
as the United States Football Association (USFA), presently known as the 
United States Soccer Federation. FIFA quickly granted a provisional membership 
and USFA began exerting its influence on the sport. This led to the establishment 
of the National Challenge Cup, which still exists as the Lamar Hunt U.S. 
Open Cup, that fall. The National Challenge Cup quickly grew to overshadow 
the American Cup. However, both cups were played simultaneously for the 
next ten years. Declining respect for the AFA led to the withdrawal of 
several associations from its cup in 1917. Further competition came in 
1924 when USFA created the National Amateur Cup. That spelled the death 
knell for the American Cup. It played its last season in 1924. During the 
days of the American Soccer League, the league was seen as widely popular, 
and considered to be the second-most popular sports league in the United 
States, only behind Major League Baseball.[citation needed] However, the 
"soccer war" between the USFA and ASL, combined with the onset of the Great 
Depression in 1929, led to the demise of the ASL in 1933, and the demise 
of the sport in the United States, entering a prolonged time of obscurity. 
The prominence of college soccer increased with the NCAA sanctioning an 
annual men's soccer championship, beginning in 1959 with the inaugural 
championship won by Saint Louis University. Two professional soccer leagues 
were started in 1967, the United Soccer Association and the National Professional 
Soccer League, which merged to form the North American Soccer League in 
1968. The NASL enjoyed a significant boost in popularity when the New York 
Cosmos signed Pelé to play for three seasons in 1975–77. The Cosmos drew 
large publicity throughout the late 1970s. Between 1977 and 1980, the Cosmos 
drew crowds of more than 60,000 on ten occasions, and over 70,000 on seven 
occasions (see Record attendances in United States club soccer). The NASL 
declined during the early 1980s and disbanded in 1984. The popularity of 
indoor soccer peaked in the 1980s, with both the NASL[17] and the Major 
Indoor Soccer League (1978–1992) operating indoor soccer leagues. The 1970s 
and 1980s saw increased popularity of the college game. Women's college 
soccer received a significant boost in 1972 with the passage of Title IX, 
which mandated equal funding for women's athletic programs,[citation needed] 
leading to colleges forming NCAA-sanctioned women's varsity teams. A men's 
match between Saint Louis University and local rival SIU Edwardsville drew 
a college record 22,512 fans to Busch Stadium on October 30, 1980.[18] 
By 1984, more colleges played soccer (532) than American football (505).[19] 
In 1967 there were 100,000 people playing soccer in the US; by 1984, that 
number had grown to over 4 million.[19] Girls high school soccer experienced 
tremendous growth in playing numbers throughout the 1970s and 1980s—from 
10,000 in 1976, to 41,000 in 1980, to 122,000 in 1990.[20] The soccer matches 
for the 1984 Summer Olympics were well attended. Five matches drew over 
75,000 fans, and two soccer matches at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, 
California, drew over 100,000 fans.[21] These high attendance figures were 
one factor that FIFA took into consideration in 1988 when deciding to award 
the 1994 World Cup to the United States.[22] Interest in soccer within 
the United States continued to grow during the 1990s. This growth has been 
attributed in significant part to the FIFA World Cup being held in the 
United States for the first time in 1994. This won the sport more attention 
from both the media and casual sports fans. The tournament was successful, 
drawing an average attendance of 68,991, a World Cup record that still 
stands today. The 1994 World Cup drew record TV audiences in the U.S.[23] 
As part of the United States' bid to host the 1994 World Cup, U.S. Soccer 
pledged to create a professional outdoor league. Major League Soccer launched 
in 1996, which helped develop American players in a way that was not possible 
without a domestic league. Many of these players competed in the 2002 FIFA 
World Cup, where the United States reached the quarterfinals, its best 
result in the modern era. The growth of the women's game during the 1990s 
helped increase overall interest in soccer in the United States. The number 
of women's college soccer teams increased from 318 in 1991 to 959 in 2009.[24] 
Both the 1999 and 2003 FIFA Women's World Cups were held in the United 
States. The crowd of over 90,000 at the Rose Bowl for the 1999 FIFA Women's 
World Cup Final remains the largest crowd in the world to witness any women's 
sporting event.[25] Over 24 million Americans play soccer as of 2006. There 
are 4.2 million players (2.5 million men and 1.7 million women) registered 
with U.S. Soccer.[26] Thirty percent of American households contain someone 
playing soccer, a figure second only to baseball.[27] Increasing numbers 
of Americans, having played the game in their youth, are now avid spectators. 
The annual ESPN sports poll has shown soccer as the fourth most popular 
team sport in the United States every year since overtaking hockey in 2006;[28] 
as of 2011, 8.2% of Americans rank soccer as their favorite sport (compared 
to 3.8% for hockey).[29] A 2012 Harris Interactive poll showed soccer to 
be the fifth favorite team sport, with 2% of Americans ranking soccer as 
their favorite (compared to 5% for hockey).[30] A 2011 ESPN sports poll 
ranked soccer as the second most popular sport in the country for 12- to 
24-year-olds.[31] In 2013, Lionel Messi became the first soccer player 
ever to rank among the Top 10 most popular athletes in the U.S in an ESPN 
poll,[32] although he was not listed in the Top 10 in a Harris poll.[33] 
Many soccer matches in the United States draw large crowds, particularly 
international matches. A 2014 International Champions Cup match between 
Real Madrid and Manchester United at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, Michigan 
had an attendance of 109,318, a record crowd for a U.S. soccer match.[36] 
The 2009 Gold Cup quarterfinal matches drew over 82,000 to Cowboys Stadium 
(now known as AT&T Stadium). Between 2008–2011, the U.S. played three times 
in East Rutherford, New Jersey, drawing over 78,000 fans each game.[21] 
The United States and Mexico national teams have been playing in front 
of crowds in excess of 60,000 in the U.S. in recent years. Also in recent 
years, many top-division European clubs—such as English clubs Manchester 
United and Chelsea, and Spanish clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona—have spent 
portions of their pre-season summer schedule playing matches in the United 
States. These matches have been highly attended events for U.S. stadiums. 
The 2009 World Football Challenge drew large crowds around the country, 
and Chelsea's four-game stint in the United States drew record crowds for 
a visiting foreign team.[37] Nations from other regions have decided to 
organize tournaments in the U.S., given the growing soccer market in the 
country. For example, the 2014 Copa Centroamericana, a soccer competition 
for countries from Central America, was held in the U.S., due to the commercial 
appeal of the U.S. soccer market.[38] Similarly, the 2016 Copa América 
was also held in the U.S., marking the first time that tournament took 
place outside of South America. The U.S. was selected to host for financial 
reasons, because "the market is in the United States, the stadiums are 
in the United States . . . everything is in the United States."[39] Furthermore, 
several nations schedule friendly matches to be held in the U.S. against 
opponents other than the U.S. national team. For example, the Mexico national 
team usually schedules several friendlies in the U.S. each year against 
various opponents. The El Salvador national team also regularly plays friendlies 
in the U.S., often in the Washington, D.C. area. The Brazil, Argentina, 
and Colombia national teams also play matches in the U.S. U.S. television 
coverage and viewership of club and international soccer is at an all-time 
high. Mainstream sports networks ESPN, Fox Sports, and NBC Sports Network 
regularly provide coverage of soccer, as do several popular Spanish-language 
channels such as Telemundo, UniMás, and Galavisión. Additionally, the U.S. 
has several networks devoted mostly or completely to the sport, including 
Gol TV and beIN Sport USA. The size of the annual TV market in the U.S. 
for annual club soccer competitions was $126 million as of 2009. The club 
soccer competitions that generate the most annual revenue from TV audiences 
today in the United States are England's Premier League ($167m), Major 
League Soccer ($90m), the Mexican league ($50m), Spain's La Liga ($16m), 
and the UEFA Champions League ($10m).[40] The most widely accessed televised 
soccer league in the United States is Mexico's Liga MX, which has most 
of its games televised live and free on television channels Azteca, Telemundo, 
UniMás and Univision. Fox began showing English Premier League matches 
on network TV in 2011, the first time that Premier League matches aired 
on U.S. broadcast TV.[41] U.S. TV rights for the English Premier League 
were sold to NBC Sports in 2012 for $250 million for three years beginning 
with the 2013–14 season.[42] Viewership for the Premier League's 2013-14 
season on NBC Sports was 32 million, more than double the previous season.[43] 
The Premier League earns higher ratings on NBCSN than the National Hockey 
League, despite the fact that the Premier League is shown in the morning 
while NHL games are in primetime.[44] Major League Soccer has received 
broadcast fees from ESPN since 2008, and MLS signed a three-year deal in 
2011 with NBC Sports to nationally televise 40 matches per year from 2012–2014. 
MLS has since then signed new television agreements with ESPN, FOX Sports, 
and Univision worth in total $90 million per year from 2015–2022. In addition, 
the 2010 UEFA Champions League final was broadcast live on the Fox Network, 
marking the first time in history that a soccer match between two European 
club teams was televised in the U.S. on English-language broadcast television.[citation 
needed] Notes: In addition, these TV networks also provide coverage of 
international soccer competitions, including the FIFA World Cup, the FIFA 
Women's World Cup, the CONCACAF Gold Cup, the UEFA European Championship, 
the FIFA Confederations Cup, and the U.S. men's national team, and women's 
national team matches. The Mexico national football team is also a popular 
team featured on Spanish language television and on ESPN. In addition to 
the World Cup, other international soccer competitions involving the U.S. 
team have become more popular among TV viewers. The 2007 CONCACAF Gold 
Cup attracted record television viewership, with the Univision telecast 
of the final between the United States and Mexico ranking as the third-most 
watched Spanish-language program of all-time in the United States, beaten 
only by two FIFA World Cup finals matches. The 2009 Confederations Cup 
Final featuring the United States attracted 6.9 million viewers (including 
both the English and Spanish broadcasts).[54] The 2013 World Cup qualifier 
between the U.S. and Mexico drew 7 million viewers, higher than the 5.8 
million average viewers of the 2013 NHL Stanley Cup finals.[55] Three 2013 
Gold Cup matches were broadcast on the main Fox network channel, the first 
time since 2002 that a U.S. national team match outside of the World Cup 
was broadcast on network TV.[56] TV networks in the U.S. have also begun 
showing international soccer tournaments that do not include the United 
States. Euro 2008 was shown on ESPN and ABC. Viewership for the Euro 2012 
was 51% higher than 2008, with the 2012 final watched by over 4 million 
viewers.[57] The viewership on ESPN of the group-stage matches of the 2013 
Confederations Cup was 26% higher than the 2009 tournament, even though 
the U.S. did not play in the 2013 tournament.[58] The most popular soccer 
event on TV in the U.S. is the FIFA World Cup. In 2005, the U.S. TV rights 
for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups were sold to ABC/ESPN and Univision for 
$425 million in "the biggest TV deal in a single country in FIFA's history."[59][60][61] 
The telecasts of the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final attracted an estimated 17 
million American viewers, higher than the 15.8 million average viewership 
of the 2006 World Series.[62][63] The total TV viewership in the U.S. for 
all the matches including the final for the 2010 World Cup was 112 million 
viewers, a 22% increase over viewing numbers for the 2006 World Cup.[64] 
The 2010 World Cup final game drew 24.3 million viewers in the United States,[65] 
higher than the 14.3 million average viewership of the 2010 World Series.[63][66] 
Landon Donovan's dramatic game-winning goal against Algeria that advanced 
the US team to the knockout stage of the 2010 World Cup resulted in jubilant 
celebrations across the United States. In 2011, the U.S. TV rights for 
the 2018 and 2022 World Cups were sold to Fox and Telemundo for a record 
$1.1 billion, more than any other country in the world, and 147 percent 
higher than the 2010 and 2014 TV rights.[59] By 2014, the World Cup was 
considered an elite sports property on U.S. television.[67] The USA-Portugal 
match during the 2014 World Cup registered 18.2 million viewers on ESPN, 
making it the most viewed program on ESPN, other than NFL or college football 
games, and eclipsing viewership numbers of other high-profile sports events 
such as MLB's World Series, the NBA Finals, and the NHL's Stanley Cup Finals.[67][68] 
The 2014 FIFA World Cup also generated strong internet traffic, with the 
tournament generating more viewers via websites and apps than the 2012 
Summer Olympics.[69] World Cup Tournament: Cumulative U.S. Viewership by 
Year Here are the complete tournament cumulative viewership totals for 
every World Cup tournament since 1994. These totals account for all matches 
played throughout the tournament. Since matches take place at different 
times individual viewers will be counted multiple times. Only ESPN totals 
have been accounted for. Please find Spanish viewership as well. For context, 
the average number of viewers of that year's NFL Super Bowl are also provided. 
World Cup Final Match — U.S. Viewership by Year The total number of viewers 
in the United States who watched the World Cup final match are as follows. 
English and Spanish channel viewership along with internet viewership are 
accounted for in these statistics. For context, the average number of viewers 
of that year's MLB best-of-seven World Series are also provided. Other 
World Cup Matches With Most U.S. Viewers The following table shows the 
matches (other than a final match, which are shown in the table above) 
at the FIFA World Cup that scored the highest TV viewership. English and 
Spanish channel viewership (and internet viewership, where indicated) are 
accounted for in these statistics. All of the most-watched matches have 
taken place since 2010. The highest-rated U.S. World Cup matches have generally 
involved the U.S. national team. The following table shows the most-viewed 
international men's team matches other than World Cup matches. Both English 
and Spanish channel viewership are accounted for in these statistics. FIFA 
Women's World Cup matches with highest U.S. viewership:[96] Top ten, ranked 
by millions of viewers Sports television networks like ESPN, Fox Sports, 
NBC Sports and beIN Sports offer streaming services to cable / satellite 
television subscribers. Over-the-top streaming services like Sling TV and 
PlayStation Vue also offer sports channels. In addition, Fox Soccer 2Go 
and FuboTV are soccer-specific over-the-top streaming services. The largest 
category of soccer in the United States in terms of participation is boys' 
and girls' youth soccer. Soccer is one of the most played sports by children 
in the United States. In 2012, soccer was the #4 most played team sport 
by high school boys, and soccer overtook softball to become the #3 most 
played team sport by high school girls.[103] As of 2006, the U.S. was the 
#1 country in the world for participation in youth soccer, with 3.9 million 
American youths (2.3 million boys and 1.6 million girls) registered with 
U.S. Soccer.[104] Among girls, the U.S. has more registered players than 
all other countries combined.[105] The number of high school soccer players 
more than doubled from 1990 to 2010, giving soccer the fastest growth rate 
among all major U.S. sports.[106] In recent decades, more youth sports 
organizations have turned to soccer as a supplement to American football,[citation 
needed] and most American high schools offer both boys and girls soccer. 
Due to the rising number of youths playing, the term soccer mom is used 
in American social and political discourse to describe middle- or upper-middle 
class suburban women with school-age children.[citation needed] Americans 
between the ages of 12 and 24 rank professional soccer as their second 
favorite sport behind only American football.[107] And in 2011, the FIFA 
video game ranked as the #2 most popular video game in the country, behind 
only Madden.[108] Though organized locally by organizations all over the 
United States, there are three main youth soccer organizations working 
nationwide through affiliated local associations. The United States Youth 
Soccer Association boasts over three million players between the ages of 
five and 19, while American Youth Soccer Organization has more than 600,000[109] 
players between the ages of four and 19. Finally, the USL offers a number 
of youth leagues, including the Super-20 League and the Super Y-League, 
which have almost 1,000 teams and tens of thousands of players from the 
ages of 13 to 20. The professional first-division league in the United 
States is Major League Soccer (MLS), which currently has 17 teams in the 
U.S. and 3 in Canada. With careful cost controls and the construction of 
soccer-specific stadiums, some MLS clubs became profitable for the first 
time in the mid-2000s, and Forbes magazine found that three clubs were 
already valued at $40 million or more, with the Los Angeles Galaxy worth 
$100 million.[110] The establishment of the Designated Player Rule in 2007 
has led to the signings of international superstars such as David Beckham 
and Thierry Henry, and Cuauhtémoc Blanco. Major League Soccer has been 
in an expansion phase, going from 10 teams in 2005 to 20 teams today, with 
plans to add a new Atlanta team in 2017, a new Twin Cities team in 2017, 
and a second Los Angeles team (replacing another team in that city folded 
by the league) in 2018, and to expand to 24 teams by 2020. The league's 
2007 and 2009 expansion to Toronto and Seattle, respectively, have proven 
highly successful, with league-leading ticket and merchandise sales, capped 
by a sold-out attendances for friendlies against Real Madrid of Spain and 
Chelsea of England.[111] In 2013, New York City FC agreed to pay a record 
$100 million expansion fee for the right to join MLS in 2015.[112] MLS 
average attendance has been steadily growing, from 13,756 in 2000 to 18,807 
in 2012. MLS has drawn a higher per-game attendance than NBA basketball 
and NHL hockey every year since 2011.[113][114] Professional soccer has 
been less popular in the United States than most other parts of the world.[citation 
needed] Although MLS is also much younger than most other countries' first 
divisions, it is already the 12th most-attended premier division in the 
world.[115] MLS has announced its goal of developing into one of the top 
soccer leagues in the world by 2022.[116] The second-tier league is a new 
version of the North American Soccer League. This league was formed in 
late 2009, with plans to launch in the 2010 season, by disgruntled team 
owners from the former second-level league, the USL First Division, after 
Nike sold its stake in the latter league's parent corporation, the United 
Soccer Leagues (USL). U.S. Soccer refused to sanction either the First 
Division or the new NASL for 2010, and the two groups eventually agreed 
to unite for 2010 only under the banner of USSF Division 2, run directly 
by U.S. Soccer and including teams from both leagues. U.S. Soccer initially 
sanctioned the new NASL in November 2010, revoked its sanctioning in January 
2011 due to financial issues surrounding the ownership of several teams, 
and re-sanctioned it in February 2011. The NASL launched in 2011 with eight 
teams—five on the U.S. mainland, one in Puerto Rico (a U.S. commonwealth 
that has its own national federation), and two in Canada. One of the Canadian 
teams left the NASL after the 2011 season to enter MLS; the league remained 
at eight teams for 2012 as San Antonio Scorpions FC joined NASL. In 2013, 
a new version of the New York Cosmos joined the NASL. Ottawa Fury FC and 
Indy Eleven joined in 2014. Three teams were set to join the league in 
2015—Jacksonville Armada FC, Virginia Cavalry FC, and Oklahoma City FC—but 
only the Jacksonville team actually began play. Virginia Cavalry is no 
longer listed as a future team on the NASL website; Oklahoma City FC was 
bought by the owner of Spanish club Rayo Vallecano and rebranded as Rayo 
OKC, which began play in 2016. Two other teams, Miami FC and Puerto Rico 
FC, were launched in 2016, with Miami starting play in the league's spring 
season and Puerto Rico in the fall season. At the same time, the Atlanta 
Silverbacks and San Antonio Scorpions folded. After the 2016 season, Minnesota 
United left for MLS, and Ottawa Fury FC and the Tampa Bay Rowdies left 
for the third-level United Soccer League (not to be confused with its parent 
organization, the United Soccer Leagues); the NASL will add the San Francisco 
Deltas for the 2017 season. Following the USL–NASL feud and a subsequent 
tightening of U.S. Soccer standards for owners of second-division teams, 
the USL folded its First and Second Divisions into a new third-level league 
originally known as USL Pro and now as the United Soccer League, which 
launched in 2011. It began with 15 teams–11 on the U.S. mainland, three 
in Puerto Rico, and one in Antigua and Barbuda—but due to issues with the 
health and finances of two of the Puerto Rican owners, the Puerto Rican 
teams were dropped from the league shortly after the beginning of its first 
season. One of the U.S.-based teams folded following the 2011 season; two 
new U.S.-based teams joined the league in 2013. In that same year, MLS 
and USL Pro entered into a formal agreement that eventually merged the 
MLS Reserve League into the USL Pro structure. Each MLS team is now required 
to field a reserve team in the United Soccer League, either by operating 
a standalone team or affiliating with an independently owned team. After 
the 2013 season, the Antigua and Barbuda team folded, as well as one U.S.-based 
team. In addition, one U.S.-based team left the league but was replaced 
by a new team in the same area; and three completely new teams entered 
the league for 2014. One of the new teams was an MLS reserve side. The 
2015 season, which coincided with the rebranding of the competition as 
the United Soccer League, saw a major expansion. Three teams left the league, 
but 13 new teams entered, bringing its membership to 24. Orlando City moved 
to MLS, and two other teams, the Charlotte Eagles and Dayton Dutch Lions, 
relegated themselves to the PDL. Two of the three departing teams were 
replaced by new franchises; the Eagles' franchise rights were acquired 
by a local group that launched the Charlotte Independence, and Louisville 
interests bought Orlando City's USL franchise rights and launched Louisville 
City FC. Both of these clubs became affiliates of MLS teams, respectively 
the Colorado Rapids and Orlando City. Seven MLS teams—the Montreal Impact, 
New York Red Bulls, Portland Timbers, Real Salt Lake, Seattle Sounders, 
Toronto FC, and Vancouver Whitecaps—began fielding team-operated reserve 
sides in the USL. The Orlando City–Louisville affiliation was only for 
the 2015 season, as Orlando City launched Orlando City B, its own USL reserve 
side, in 2016. The USL expanded to 29 teams in 2016. While Austin Aztex 
went on hiatus for that season while seeking to build a new stadium, six 
new teams were launched. Three are operated by MLS teams—Orlando City B, 
Bethlehem Steel FC (Philadelphia Union), and Swope Park Rangers (Sporting 
Kansas City). The other three are FC Cincinnati and San Antonio FC, neither 
of which has an MLS affiliation, and the Rio Grande Valley FC Toros. The 
Toros are the first USL team with a so-called "hybrid affiliation" with 
an MLS team; the Houston Dynamo selects players and coaches, while the 
separate Toros ownership group runs all business affairs. In 2017, the 
USL is expected to expand to 31 teams. While the return of the Aztex is 
still delayed, and the Wilmington Hammerheads self-relegated to the PDL, 
the league will add three teams. As mentioned previously, Ottawa Fury FC 
and the Tampa Bay Rowdies will join from the NASL, and the completely new 
Reno 1868 FC will compete as a hybrid affiliate of the San Jose Earthquakes. 
The league has also announced that Nashville SC will join in 2018. The 
United Soccer Leagues operate five leagues in all, spanning the lower divisions 
of men's professional soccer, as well as women's soccer and youth soccer. 
Below the United Soccer League is the country's semi-professional fourth-division 
league, the Premier Development League, which has (as of the 2015 season) 
58 teams in the U.S. and six in Canada (the league has also previously 
had a team in Bermuda). Though the PDL does have some paid players, it 
also has many teams that are made up entirely or almost entirely of college 
soccer players who use the league as an opportunity to play competitive 
soccer in front of professional scouts during the summer, while retaining 
amateur status and NCAA eligibility. The United States Adult Soccer Association 
governs amateur soccer competition for adults throughout the United States, 
which is effectively the amateur fifth division of soccer in the United 
States. The Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup is a knockout tournament in American 
soccer. The tournament is the oldest ongoing national soccer competition 
in the U.S. and was historically open to all United States Soccer Federation 
affiliated teams, from amateur adult club teams to the professional clubs 
of Major League Soccer. Starting in 2016, professional teams that are majority-owned, 
or whose playing staff is managed, by a higher-division outdoor professional 
team are barred from the competition; all other US Soccer-affiliated teams 
remain eligible to enter. The Open Cup was first held in 1913–14, when 
it was called the National Challenge Cup. The overall league structure 
in the United States is significantly different from that used in almost 
all the rest of the world, but similar to that used by other American team 
sports leagues, in that there is no system of promotion and relegation 
between lower and higher leagues, but rather a minor league system, generally 
the same as almost all other top-level pro sports leagues in North America. 
In addition, teams playing in American soccer leagues are not private clubs 
founded independently of the league that join a league in order to ensure 
regular fixtures, but are instead usually franchises of the league itself. 
Finally, the soccer leagues in the United States also incorporate features 
common to other American sports leagues, most notably the determination 
of champions by playoffs between the top teams after the conclusion of 
a league season. MLS formerly had a balanced schedule and prior to then 
used an unbalanced schedule. However, due to MLS's recent expansion, the 
league has returned to an unbalanced schedule. However, in several ways, 
American soccer leagues have become more similar to leagues in the rest 
of the world in recent years. MLS and USL now allow games to end in ties, 
which were initially avoided via a penalty shootout if scores were level 
at the end of play. This was done to avoid alienating mainstream American 
sports fans, who are not accustomed to tie games, but actually had the 
unintended consequence of alienating soccer purists who saw the change 
as an "Americanization" of the sport. MLS began allowing ties in the 2000 
season. Additionally, MLS and USL now use upward-counting clocks that do 
not stop for stoppages in play, and instead add on time before half time 
and full-time. A downward-counting clock that stops for dead balls and 
ends the game when it reaches zero is still in use in American high school 
and college soccer, as well as most other American sports, but was and 
is completely foreign to soccer played outside the United States. MLS adopted 
the international clock in 2000. Finally, until recently,[when?] the front 
of teams' shirts in MLS and the USL did not bear advertisements, as commercial 
uniform sponsorship is uncommon in American sports. However, starting in 
the mid-2000s, clubs were allowed to accept corporate sponsorship on the 
front of their shirts. Women's soccer in the United States has been played 
at the professional level, but two attempts at professional leagues have 
failed. Originally called the United States Interregional Women's League, 
the W-League was formed in 1995 to provide a professional outlet for many 
of the top female soccer players in the country. Starting as the Western 
Division of the W-League, the Women's Premier Soccer League (WPSL) broke 
away and formed its own league in 1997 and had its inaugural season in 
1998. Both the W-League and the WPSL were considered the premier women's 
soccer leagues in the United States at the time, but eventually fell to 
a "second-tier" level upon the formation of the Women's United Soccer Association. 
As a result of the US women's national team's (USWNT) first-place showing 
in the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, a seemingly viable market for the sport 
germinated. Feeding on the momentum of their victory, the eight-team league 
formed in February 2000, the US Soccer Federation approved membership of 
the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) as a sanctioned Division 1 
women's professional soccer league on August 18, 2000, and the league began 
playing its first season in April 2001. It would be the world's first women's 
soccer league in which all the players were paid as professionals.[citation 
needed] The WUSA had previously announced plans to begin play in 2001 in 
eight cities across the country, including: Atlanta, the Bay Area, Boston, 
New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Diego and Washington, D.C. The WUSA 
forged ahead on a cooperation agreement that would see the new league work 
side-by-side with Major League Soccer to help maximize the market presence 
and success of both Division I leagues.[117] The eight teams included the 
Atlanta Beat, Boston Breakers, Carolina Courage, New York Power, Philadelphia 
Charge, San Diego Spirit, San Jose CyberRays (called Bay Area CyberRays 
for 2001 season), and the Washington Freedom. The WUSA played for three 
full seasons. The WUSA suspended operations, however, on September 15, 
2003, shortly after the conclusion of the third season, due to financial 
problems and lack of public interest in the sport.[118] With the WUSA on 
hiatus, the Women's Premier Soccer League (WPSL) and the W-League regained 
their status as the premier women's soccer leagues in the United States, 
and many former WUSA players joined those teams. The Washington Freedom 
was the only WUSA team to continue operations after the league dissolved 
(although new versions of the Atlanta Beat and Boston Breakers formed in 
2009) and eventually became a part of the W-League in 2006. After the folding 
of WUSA, WUSA Reorganization Committee was formed in September 2003 that 
led to the founding of Women's Soccer Initiative, Inc. (WSII), whose stated 
goal was "promoting and supporting all aspects of women's soccer in the 
United States", including the founding of a new professional league.[119] 
Initial plans were to play a scaled down version of WUSA in 2004. However, 
these plans fell through and instead, in June 2004, the WUSA held two "WUSA 
Festivals" in Los Angeles and Blaine, Minnesota, featuring matches between 
reconstituted WUSA teams in order to maintain the league in the public 
eye and sustain interest in women's professional soccer.[120] A planned 
full relaunch in 2005 also fell through. In June 2006, WSII announced the 
relaunch of the league for the 2008 season.[121] In December 2006, WSII 
announced that it reached an agreement with six owner-operators for teams 
based in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Washington, D.C., and 
a then-unnamed city.[122] In September 2007, the launch was pushed back 
from Spring of 2008 to 2009 to avoid clashing with 2007 Women's World Cup 
and the 2008 Olympic Games and to ensure that all of the teams were fully 
prepared for long-term operations.[123] The name for the new professional 
league, along with its logo, was announced on January 17, 2008. The league 
was to have its inaugural season in 2009, with seven teams, including the 
Washington Freedom, a former WUSA team. Twenty-one US nation team players 
were allocated to each of the seven teams in September 2008. Also in September, 
the league held the 2008 WPS International Draft. Unlike WUSA, the WPS 
took "a local, grass roots approach", and "a slow and steady growth type 
of approach," In addition, the WPS attempted to have a closer relationship 
with Major League Soccer in order to cut costs. Most teams considered the 
first season a moderate success, despite many losing more money than planned. 
However, most teams began to see problems in 2010. Overall attendance for 
2010 was noticeably down from 2009, teams were struggling with financial 
problems, and the WPS changed leadership by the end of the season. The 
success of the United States women's national soccer team at the 2011 FIFA 
Women's World Cup resulted in an upsurge in attendance league-wide as well 
as interest in new teams for the 2012 season. However, several internal 
organization struggles, including an ongoing legal battle with magicJack-owner 
Dan Borislow, and lack of resources invested in the league lead to the 
suspension of the 2012, announced in January, 2012. On May 18, 2012 the 
WPS announced that the league had officially ceased operations, having 
played for only three seasons. By this time, the WPSL and W-League were 
the two semi-pro leagues in the United States and had sat under WUSA and 
the WPS until 2012. Upon the disbandment of the WPS, they once again regained 
their status as the premier women's soccer leagues in the United States. 
In response to the suspension, and eventual end, of the WPS, the Women's 
Premier Soccer League created the Women's Premier Soccer League Elite (WPSL 
Elite) to support the sport in the United States. For the 2012 season, 
the league featured former WPS teams, Boston Breakers, Chicago Red Stars, 
and Western New York Flash, in addition to many WPSL teams. Six of the 
eight teams were considered fully professional. Many members of the USWNT 
remained unattached for the 2012 season while others chose to play in the 
W-League instead of the WPSL Elite. After the WPS folded in 2012, the United 
States Soccer Federation (USSF) announced a roundtable for discussion of 
the future of women's professional soccer in the United States. The meeting 
resulted in the planning of a new league set to launch in 2013 with 12-16 
teams, taking from the WPS, the W-League, and the WPSL. The league was 
officially announced by U.S. Soccer on November 21, 2012, with the Canadian 
Soccer Association (CSA) and Mexican Football Federation (FMF) also participating 
in the announcement.[124] The league will be called the National Women's 
Soccer League (NWSL).[125] Teams in the NWSL are privately owned, but national 
federations are heavily involved in league financing and operations.[126] 
All three federations are paying salaries for many of their respective 
national team members. U.S. Soccer committed to funding up to 24 national 
team members, with the CSA committing to paying 16 players and FMF pledging 
support for 12 to 16 (ultimately 16).[126] This freed each of the eight 
charter teams from having to pay salaries for up to seven players.[127] 
In addition, U.S. Soccer hosts the new league's front office, and is scheduling 
matches to avoid conflicts with international tournaments.[126] Four of 
the league's charter teams have WPS ties—the Boston Breakers, Chicago Red 
Stars, a revival of the New Jersey-based Sky Blue FC, and the Western New 
York Flash. The other four are in Kansas City, Portland, Seattle, and Washington, 
D.C., with the Portland team being run by the Portland Timbers.[126] The 
league added its second MLS-linked team in 2014 with the entry of the Houston 
Dash, run by the Houston Dynamo and playing in the Dynamo's stadium.[128] 
A third NWSL team, FC Kansas City, announced a partnership with Sporting 
Kansas City in 2015; although the two clubs continue to be separately owned, 
FC Kansas City now uses Sporting's facilities for practices and home games.[129] 
Another MLS-linked team joined the league in 2016 with the arrival of the 
Orlando Pride, operated by Orlando City SC.[130] The NWSL became the first 
professional women's league to reach more than eight teams with the addition 
of the Houston Dash and Orlando Pride (10 teams in the league as of 2016) 
and the first to sustain more than three years of operations.[citation

the United States in international competition. The men's national team 
competes in the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Confederations Cup, in addition 
to the CONCACAF Gold Cup and other competitions by invitation. The U.S. 
national team had some success in early FIFA World Cup tournaments. The 
U.S. finished third in the World Cup in 1930, and played in the 1934 World 
Cup. The next World Cup participation came in the 1950 World Cup, where 
they upset England 1-0 in group play. After 1950, the USA did not return 
to the World Cup for another 40 years. The fortunes of the U.S. national 
team changed in the 1990s, with the team participating in every World Cup 
since 1990. The USA hosted the 1994 World Cup, beating Colombia to reach 
the knockout rounds, before losing to Brazil in the round of sixteen. The 
team reached the quarter-finals of the 2002 World Cup by defeating its 
rival Mexico. The U.S. team also accomplished another first by winning 
its group at the 2010 World Cup. The U.S. national team participated in 
the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup. The U.S. defeated #1 ranked Spain in 
the semifinals, before losing to Brazil 3-2 in the final. On the regional 
stage, the national team has also improved, with a record up to 2013 of 
reaching the final of the biannual CONCACAF Gold Cup nine times since 1989, 
winning it five times: 1991, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2013. The Women's National 
Soccer Team of the 19 hundreds, were the first ever Women's National Team 
in the United States. They competed in the FIFA Women's World Cup, the 
Summer Olympics, and the Algarve Cup, in addition to the CONCACAF Women's 
Gold Cup and other competitions by invitation. The United States women's 
team has been one of the best national teams in the history of women's 
soccer, having won three World Cups (in 1991, 1999, and 2015). They also 
won four Olympic gold medals (in 1996, 2004, 2008, and 2012), and 10 Algarve 
Cups (in 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2015). 
Following their 2015 World Cup victory, the USWNT regained the top spot 
in the FIFA Women's World Rankings from Germany;[131] they have held the 
top spot for the majority of the time since the rankings began in 2003, 
and have never been lower than second. There are several factors that may 
have contributed to the early dominance of the United States women's national 
soccer team. First is the relative lack of attention afforded the women's 
game in some traditional soccer-playing countries. According to a 2015 
story in the ESPN-owned Web outlet FiveThirtyEight, For as much as the 
rest of the world loves soccer, it has been much slower to embrace the 
women's game than the U.S. In England, women playing soccer was effectively 
banned (at least at venues that hosted men's teams) from 1921 to 1971, 
and in Germany it was banned from 1955 to 1970. At around the time Title 
IX was heating up in the United States, women's international soccer basically 
didn’t exist. According to FIFA, there were only three national teams and 
two international matches played in 1971.[105] Additionally, in the years 
following Title IX, American high schools and colleges have been steadily 
embracing girls' and women's soccer. According to the National Federation 
of State High School Associations (NFHS), the U.S. had little more than 
10,000 girls playing high school soccer in the late 1970s. This number 
had increased to 120,000 by 1991, when the USWNT claimed its first World 
Cup title, and 250,000 by 1999, the year of the second World Cup title. 
In 2015, there were about 375,000 girls playing high school soccer, making 
up 47% of all high school soccer players, and soccer has recently surpassed 
softball as the third-most-played girls' team sport.[105] At the college 
level, 53% of all NCAA soccer players are women, and this percentage rises 
to 61% at the highest level, Division I.[105] Another contributing factor 
is the role of women within American society, which includes relative equality 
(especially rejecting hardened gender roles) for women in the United States 
relative to many other countries. This is also reflected in official government 
policy regarding women in athletics, specifically the landmark Title IX 
legislation, which broadly requires any educational institution that receives 
federal government funds to support men's and women's educational programs 
equally, thus including athletics. America's approach to growing the game 
among women has served as a model for other countries' development programs 
for women at all levels.[citation needed] However, the FiveThirtyEight 
story suggested that the U.S. does not take adult women's soccer as seriously 
as some other countries, notably Germany. On a per capita basis, the U.S. 
and Germany have essentially identical participation among girls. However, 
the two countries differ greatly in the age profile of their registered 
female players. Nearly 95% of registered female players in the U.S. are 
youths, as opposed to 31% in Germany. In turn, this leads to Germany having 
more than six times the number of serious adult female players as the U.S. 
(about 650,000 to 100,000).[105] In the United States, college soccer is 
featured in many collegiate athletic associations including the NCAA, the 
NAIA, the NCCAA, and the USCAA. Many top American college soccer players 
play for separate teams in the Premier Development League (PDL) during 
the summer. The NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship, the semifinals 
and finals of which are known as the College Cup, is an American intercollegiate 
college soccer tournament conducted by the NCAA, and determines the Division 
I men's national champion. The tournament has been formally held since 
1959, when it crowned Saint Louis University as the inaugural champion. 
The tournament's current format involves 48 teams, in which every Division 
I conference tournament champion is allocated a berth. Since its inception, 
Saint Louis (10 titles), Indiana (8 titles), and Virginia (6 titles) have 
historically been the most successful Division I schools. Indiana has appeared 
in more College Cups (18) and has a higher winning percentage in post-season 
play (.768) than any other school in Division I soccer. Since the early 
1990s, several Americans have found opportunities playing soccer at the 
highest levels of foreign leagues. Among the first Americans to become 
regulars in foreign leagues were John Harkes at Sheffield Wednesday and 
Derby County in England, Eric Wynalda at Saarbrücken in Germany, Kasey 
Keller at Millwall F.C. in England. The following is a list of Americans 
playing for in the first-team squad in the top division of one of the "Big 
Four" leagues in Europe (England, Germany, Spain, Italy). For a comprehensive 
listing of Americans abroad, see the list of American professional soccer 
players abroad. The following national teams of U.S. unincorporated territories 
compete in their corresponding regions. Their governing bodies are either 
member or associate in the corresponding regional federations. For all 
but American Samoa, players for these territories are, like most local 
residents, U.S. citizens. Natives of American Samoa are U.S. nationals,
