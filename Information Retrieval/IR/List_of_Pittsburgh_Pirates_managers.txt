The Pittsburgh Pirates are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They play in the National League Central division. 
The team began play in 1882 as the Alleghenies (alternatively spelled "Alleghenys"[1]) 
in the American Association. The franchise moved to the National League 
after owner William Nimick became upset over a contract dispute, thus beginning 
the modern day franchise.[2] The team currently plays home games at PNC 
Park which they moved into in 2001. Prior to PNC Park, the Pirates played 
games at Three Rivers Stadium and Forbes Field, among other stadiums.[3] 
There have been 39 managers for the Pittsburgh Pirates franchise. The Pirates' 
first manager was Horace Phillips, who had coached the team before their 
move to the National League.[4] In 1900, Fred Clarke began his tenure with 
the franchise. Clarke's 1422 victories and 969 losses lead all managers 
of the Pirates in their respective categories, Clarke also had the longest 
tenure as manager in his 16 years in the position.[5] Clarke managed the 
franchise to its first World Series victory, a feat that would also be 
accomplished by Bill McKechnie, Danny Murtaugh, and Chuck Tanner. Thirteen 
Pirates managers have been player-managers—those who take on simultaneous 
roles as a player and manager.[6] McKechnie, Connie Mack, and Ned Hanlon 
were inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum as managers. 
Five Pirates managers were inducted into the Hall of Fame for their performance 
as players.[7] Billy Meyer's number 1, Pie Traynor's number 20, Honus Wagner's 
number 33, and Murtaugh's number 40 have been retired by the franchise.[8] 
Hired before the 2011 season, the Pirates' current manager is Clint Hurdle.[9]
