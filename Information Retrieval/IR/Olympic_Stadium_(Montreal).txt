Olympic Stadium[1] (French: Stade olympique) is a multi-purpose stadium 
in Canada, located at Olympic Park in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district 
of Montreal. Built in the mid-1970s as the main venue for the 1976 Summer 
Olympics, it is nicknamed "The Big O", a reference to both its name and 
to the doughnut-shape of the permanent component of the stadium's roof. 
It is also called "The Big Owe" to reference the astronomical cost of the 
stadium and the 1976 Olympics as a whole.[8] The stadium is the largest 
by seating capacity in Canada. After the Olympics, artificial turf was 
installed and it became the home of Montreal's professional baseball and 
football teams. The Montreal Alouettes of the CFL returned to their previous 
home of Molson Stadium in 1998 for regular season games, but continue to 
use Olympic Stadium for playoff and Grey Cup games. Following the 2004 
baseball season, the Expos relocated to Washington, D.C. to become the 
Washington Nationals. The stadium currently serves as a multipurpose facility 
for special events (e.g. concerts, trade shows) with a permanent seating 
capacity of 56,040.[1][2] The capacity is expandable with temporary seating. 
The Montreal Impact of Major League Soccer (MLS) use the venue on occasion, 
when larger capacity is needed or when the weather restricts outdoor play 
at nearby Saputo Stadium in the spring months. The stadium has not had 
a main tenant since the Expos left in 2004. With a history of numerous 
structural and financial problems, it is largely seen as a white elephant. 
Incorporated into the north base of the stadium is the Montreal Tower, 
the world's tallest inclined tower at 175 metres (574 ft). The stadium 
and Olympic Park grounds border Maisonneuve Park, which includes the Montreal 
Botanical Garden, adjacent to the west across Rue Sherbrooke (Route 138). 
As early as 1963, Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau sought to build a covered 
stadium in Montreal.[9] A covered stadium was thought to be all but essential 
for Drapeau's other goal of bringing a Major League Baseball team to Montreal, 
given the cold weather that can affect the city in April, October and sometimes 
even September. In 1967, soon after the National League granted Montreal 
an expansion franchise for 1969, Drapeau wrote a letter promising that 
any prospective Montreal team would be playing in a covered stadium by 
1971. However, even as powerful as he was, he did not have the power to 
make such a guarantee on his own authority. Just as Charles Bronfman, who 
was slated to become the franchise's first owner, was ready to walk away, 
Drapeau had his staffers draw up a proposal for a stadium. It was enough 
to persuade Bronfman to continue with the effort.[10] The stadium was designed 
by French architect Roger Taillibert to be an elaborate facility featuring 
a retractable roof,[6] which was to be opened and closed by cables suspended 
from a huge 175-metre (574 ft) tower – the tallest inclined structure in 
the world, and the sixth tallest structure in Montreal. The design of the 
stadium resembles that of the Australian Pavilion at Expo '70 in Osaka, 
Japan.[11] Soon after Montreal was awarded the 1976 Games, Drapeau struck 
a secret deal with Taillibert to build the stadium. It only came to light 
in 1972.[10] The Olympic swimming pool is located under this tower. An 
Olympic velodrome (since converted to the Montreal Biodome, an indoor nature 
museum) was situated at the base of the tower in a building similar in 
design to the swimming pool. The building was built as the main stadium 
for the 1976 Summer Olympic Games. The stadium was host to various events 
including the opening and closing ceremonies, athletics, football finals, 
and the team jumping equestrian events.[12] The building's design is cited 
as a masterpiece of Organic Modern architecture.[13] Taillibert based the 
building on plant and animal forms, aiming to include vertebral structures 
with sinews or tentacles, while still following the basic plans of Modern 
architecture.[13] The stadium was originally slated to be finished in 1972, 
but the grand opening was cancelled due to a construction workers strike. 
Further delays ensued due to the stadium's unusual design. Additionally, 
Taillibert was not willing to back down from his original vision of the 
stadium even in the face of escalating costs for raw materials. It did 
not help that the original project manager, Trudeau et Associés, seemed 
to be incapable of handling some of the most basic construction tasks. 
The Quebec provincial government finally lost patience with the delays 
and cost overruns in 1974, and threw Taillibert off the project.[10] Additionally, 
the project was plagued by circumstances beyond anyone's control. Work 
slowed to a snail's pace for a third of the year due to Montreal's typically 
brutal winters. As a result, the stadium and tower remained unfinished 
at the opening of the 1976 Olympic Games.[10][14] The roof materials languished 
in a warehouse in Marseille until 1982, and the tower and roof were not 
completed until 1987.[9][15] It would be another year before the 66-tonne, 
5,500 m2 (59,000 sq ft) Kevlar roof could retract. Even then, it could 
not be used in winds above 40 km/h (25 mph). Ultimately, it was only opened 
and closed 88 times.[9] When construction on the stadium's tower resumed 
after the 1976 Olympics, a multi-story observatory was added to the plan, 
accessible via a funicular that travels 266 metres (873 ft) along the curved 
tower's spine. The funicular cabin ascends from base of the tower to upper 
deck in less than two minutes at a rate of 2.8 m/s (6.3 mph), with space 
for 76 persons per trip and a capacity of 500 persons per hour. The cabin 
is designed to remain level throughout its trip, while providing a panoramic 
view to its passengers. The funicular faces north-east, offering a view 
to the north, south and east. It overlooks the Olympic Village, the Biodome, 
the Botanical Gardens and Saputo Stadium. The Olympic Park, the stadium's 
suspended roof and downtown Montreal can be viewed from the south-west 
facing Observatory at the top of the tower. Despite initial projections 
in 1970 that the stadium would cost only C$134 million to construct, strikes 
and construction delays served to escalate these costs. By the time the 
stadium opened (in an unfinished form), the total costs had risen to C$264 million. 
The Quebec government introduced a special tobacco tax in May 1976 to help 
recoup its investment. By 2006, the amount contributed to the stadium's 
owner, the Olympic Installations Board (OIB) (fr: Régie des Installations 
Olympiques), accounted for 8% of the tax revenue earned from cigarette 
sales. The 1976 special tobacco tax act stipulated that once the stadium 
was paid off, ownership of the facility would be returned to the City of 
Montreal. In mid-November 2006, the stadium's costs were finally paid in 
full, more than 30 years after it opened.[8] The total expenditure (including 
repairs, renovations, construction, interest, and inflation) amounted to 
C$1.61 billion, making it—at the time all costs were paid off—the second 
most expensive stadium ever built (after Wembley Stadium in London).[16] 
Despite initial plans to complete payment in October 2006, an indoor smoking 
ban introduced in May 2006 curtailed the revenue gathered by the tobacco 
tax.[8] By 2014, the stadium's expense ranking had fallen to fifth, with 
the construction of costlier venues like MetLife Stadium, AT&T Stadium, 
and the new Yankee Stadium. Perceived by many to be a white elephant, the 
stadium has also been dubbed The Big Owe due to its astronomical cost. 
The stadium has generated on average $20 million in revenue each year since 
1977. It is estimated that a large-scale event such as the Grey Cup can 
generate as much as $50 million in revenue.[17] Although not completed 
in time for the 1976 Olympics, construction on finishing the tower resumed 
in the 1980s. During this period, however, a large fire set the tower ablaze, 
causing damage and forcing a scheduled Expos home game to be postponed. 
In 1986, a large chunk of the tower fell onto the playing field prior to 
another Expos game August 29 vs. San Diego Padres forcing a doubleheader 
on August 30.[18][19] In January 1985, approval was given by the Quebec 
government to complete the project and install a retractable roof, financed 
by an Olympic cigarette tax in the province.[20] The orange-coloured Kevlar 
roof was installed in April 1987,[21] finally completing the stadium over 
a decade late; however, soon after it was put into use it ripped on several 
occasions due to a design flaw. In the months that followed, it was plagued 
by further rips and leaks during rain storms, allowing water into the stadium.[22][23] 
As part of various renovations made in 1991 to improve the stadium's suitability 
as a baseball venue, 12,000 seats were eliminated, most of them in distant 
portions of the outfield, and home plate was moved closer to the stands. 
On September 8 of that year, support beams snapped and caused a 55-long-ton 
(62-short-ton; 56 t) concrete slab to fall onto an exterior walkway. No 
one was injured, but the Expos had to move their final 13 home games of 
that season to the opponents' cities. The Expos hinted that the 1992 season 
was at risk unless the stadium was certified safe. In early November, engineers 
found the stadium was structurally sound. However, it took longer to certify 
the roof as safe because it had been badly ripped in a June windstorm.[9] 
For the 1992 season, it was decided to keep the roof closed at all times. 
The Kevlar roof was removed in May 1998, making the stadium open-air for 
the 1998 season. Later in 1998, a $26 million non-retractable opaque blue 
roof was installed. In 1999, a 350 m2 (3,770 sq ft) portion of the roof 
collapsed on January 18, dumping ice and snow on workers that were setting 
up for the annual Montreal Auto Show.[19][24] The auto show and a boat 
show the following month were canceled,[25] and the auto show left the 
venue for good. Repaired once again, the roof was modified to better withstand 
winter conditions: the OIB installed a network of pipes to circulate heated 
water under the roof to allow for snow melting. Despite these corrective 
measures, the stadium floor remained closed from December to March.[26] 
Birdair, the fabric provider and designer of the roof, was later sued for 
the roof failure.[27] The installer of the roof, Danny's Construction, 
having suffered tremendous cost overruns along with its subcontractor Montacier, 
due to changes in the plans and specifications and delays, was terminated 
during the construction, and Birdair completed the project. Danny's Construction 
sued Birdair in 1999.[28] In February 2010, after a lengthy trial, the 
Quebec Superior Court awarded a judgement in favour of Danny's Construction 
and dismissed Birdair's countersuit.[29] The stadium's condition suffered 
considerably in the early 21st century. During the Expos' final years in 
Montreal, it was coated with grime. Much of the concrete was chipped, stained, 
and soiled. In 2009, the stadium received approval to remain open in the 
winter, provided weather conditions are favourable.[30] However, the Olympic 
Installations Board issued a report stating that the roof was unsafe during 
heavy rainfall or more than 8 centimetres (3.1 in) of snow, and that it 
rips 50 to 60 times a year. The city fire department warned in August 2009 
that without corrective measures, including a new roof, it may order the 
stadium closed. Events cannot be held if more than 3 centimetres (1.2 in) 
of snow are predicted 24 hours in advance, such as caused postponement 
of the Montreal Impact home opener soccer match in March 2014.[citation 
needed] A contract for a new permanent steel roof was awarded in 2004, 
with an estimated $300 million price tag. In June 2010, the Olympic Installations 
Board sought approval from the provincial government for the contract.[31] 
In May 2011 a committee was formed to study the future of the stadium and 
improve the usage of the stadium, pool, and sports centre.[32][33] A slab 
of concrete measuring approximately 8 by 12 metres (26 by 39 ft) fell from 
the roof of the stadium's underground parking facility on March 4, 2012. 
There were no injuries.[34] The roof continues to deteriorate, with about 
3,400 places torn as of 2013,[35] and 6,776 torn locations as of 2015, 
limiting use of the venue in winter to when there is three or less centimetres 
of snow on the roof.[36] In 2015, a new high definition scoreboard was 
installed, replacing the aging two-panel display dating back to the stadium's 
renovations in 1992.[37] The Canadian Football League's Montreal Alouettes 
became the stadium's first major post-Olympic tenant when they moved their 
home games there halfway through the 1976 season. Capacity was reduced 
from its Olympic capacity of 72,000 to 58,500, but leapt to 66,308 when 
the natural grass was replaced with AstroTurf ahead of the 1977 season.[9] 
The Alouettes remained there through 1986, the franchise's final season 
of operations. A revived Alouettes franchise returned for the 1996 and 
1997 seasons, but then moved to the Percival Molson Stadium in 1998, only 
using the larger Olympic Stadium for select regular-season and home playoff 
games. As of 2008, the franchise uses Olympic Stadium for playoff games 
only. Due to the increased popularity of the Alouettes and the small capacity 
of Percival Molson Stadium, the team considered returning to Olympic Stadium 
on a full-time basis, but instead renovated Percival Molson Stadium to 
increase its capacity.[38] Olympic Stadium has hosted the Grey Cup a total 
of six times, most recently in 2008 when the Calgary Stampeders defeated 
the hometown Alouettes. The stadium holds the record for nine of the ten 
largest crowds in CFL history, which include five regular-season and four 
Grey Cup games. A single-game record crowd numbering 69,083 attended a 
game played on September 6, 1977 between the Alouettes and Toronto Argonauts.[39] 
In 1991 and 1992, the stadium played host to the Montreal Machine of the 
World League of American Football. This included hosting World Bowl '92 
on June 6, 1992, in which the Sacramento Surge defeated the Orlando Thunder 
21–17 before 43,789.[citation needed] In 1988 (Jets and Browns) and 1990 
(Steelers and Patriots), NFL pre-season games were played at Olympic Stadium.[40][41] 
In 1977, the stadium replaced Jarry Park Stadium as the home ballpark of 
the National League's Montreal Expos. As a part of the team's franchise 
grant, a domed stadium was supposed to be in place for the 1972 baseball 
season. However, due to the delays in constructing Olympic Stadium, until 
1977, the Expos annually sought and received a waiver to remain at Jarry. 
As late as January 1977, it was thought the Expos would have to play at 
least part of the 1977 season at Jarry as well. The Parti Québécois' landslide 
victory in the 1976 provincial elections caused the Expos to break off 
lease talks. However, an agreement was reached in February, and an official 
announcement came in March.[9] The Expos regularly played 81 home games 
every season until 2003, when they played 22 home games in Puerto Rico 
at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan. The Expos played 59 home games at 
Olympic Stadium in their final two seasons of 2003 and 2004; the franchise 
moved south to Washington, D.C. for the 2005 season and became the Washington 
Nationals. Olympic Stadium's first-ever baseball game was played on April 
15, 1977. In front of 57,592, the Expos lost 7–2 to the Philadelphia Phillies. 
However, the Expos had to use a hacksaw to cut open the locks because the 
OIB did not have a master key.[9] The Expos played five home playoff games 
in 1981; two in the NLDS against the Phillies, and three in the NLCS against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers, who went on to win the World Series. On October 
19, the Expos lost the decisive fifth game, 2–1, to the Dodgers on Rick 
Monday's ninth-inning home run. In 1982, the Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game was played at Olympic Stadium in front of 59,057—a stadium record 
for baseball. On September 29, 2004, the Expos played their last game in 
Montreal, losing 9–1 to the Florida Marlins before 31,395.[42] Olympic 
Stadium proved to be somewhat problematic as a baseball venue. To accommodate 
a Canadian football field, its lower seating tier was set further back 
than in baseball-specific parks, and in stadiums used for shorter American 
football fields.[43] The upper deck was one of the highest in the majors; 
as was the case with most of its multipurpose counterparts, most of the 
upper-deck seats, particularly those in the outfield, were too far away 
to be of any use during the regular season. The Expos felt considerable 
chagrin that they were not consulted on the stadium's location, design, 
or construction even though they were slated to be its primary tenants. 
Nonetheless, for most of their tenure they put considerable effort into 
making the atmosphere more friendly for baseball. During the 1970s and 
early 1980s, fans arriving at the stadium from the Metro were greeted by 
an oom-pah band playing "The Happy Wanderer." Whenever an opposing pitcher 
tried to hold a runner at first rather than pitch, the sound system would 
cluck at him like a chicken.[10] Before the 1991 season, the OIB began 
a major overhaul on the stadium's baseball configuration. The lower deck 
in center field was removed to make room for a larger scoreboard with replay 
capability.[44] That scoreboard was installed ahead of the 1992 season. 
Also ahead of the 1992 season, home plate was moved closer to the stands 
and new seats closer to the field were installed. As part of the renovation, 
several faraway sections of permanent seating beyond the outfield fence 
were closed, replaced with bleacher seats directly behind the fence. The 
total seating capacity for baseball was reduced from a high of around 60,400 
to 46,000. The Expos were very successful in the stadium for a time, with 
above National League median attendance in 1977 and from 1979 to 1983. 
The Expos outdrew the New York Mets from 1977 to 1983, and 1994 to 1996, 
as well as the New York Yankees in 1982 and 1983.[45][46][47] The stadium's 
playing conditions left much to be desired. For most of the Expos' tenure, 
the playing surface was an extremely thin AstroTurf carpet, with only equally 
thin padding between it and the concrete floor. It was so hard on players' 
knees that visiting teams frequently ran at a nearby park. Longtime Expos 
trainer Ron McClain begged for a replacement, but the OIB was unwilling 
to spend the $1 million needed for a new surface. Before the roof finally 
arrived, players had to contend with huge patches of ice in early April 
or late September. Additionally, for most of the Expos' tenure, the padding 
on the fence was so thin that fielders risked severe injury by going after 
long fly balls. However, the OIB was unwilling to replace the padding. 
By the 1990s, several free agents specifically demanded that the Expos 
be taken out of consideration due to the poor playing conditions.[10] By 
the mid-1990s, owner Claude Brochu concluded that Olympic Stadium was not 
suitable as a baseball venue, and actively campaigned for a replacement.[10] 
Brochu sold the team to Jeffrey Loria in 2000, who was equally dissatisfied 
with Olympic Stadium; he bluntly stated, "We cannot stay here." However, 
Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard refused to authorize public funding deemed 
necessary for a replacement, in part because Olympic Stadium still had 
not been paid for.[48] Ten years after the last Expos game at Olympic Stadium, 
the Toronto Blue Jays played two spring training games at the stadium against 
the New York Mets on March 28–29, 2014, with a total official attendance 
of 96,350.[49] The Jays continued this practice in subsequent years, playing 
two pre-season games against the Cincinnati Reds on April 3–4, 2015 (with 
a combined attendance of 96,545),[50][51] and playing two pre-season games 
versus the Boston Red Sox on April 1–2, 2016 (with a combined attendance 
of 106,102).[52][53] Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates hit the 
longest home run at Olympic Stadium on May 20, 1978, driving the ball into 
the second deck in right field for an estimated distance of 535 feet. The 
yellow seat that marked the location where the ball landed has been removed 
from the 300 level. The seat is now preserved at the Canadian Baseball 
Hall of Fame. Stargell also hit a notable home run at the Expos' original 
Montreal home, Jarry Park, which landed in a swimming pool beyond the right 
field fence.[54] On April 4, 1988, the Expos' Opening Day, Darryl Strawberry 
of the New York Mets hit a ball off a speaker which hangs off a concrete 
ring at Olympic Stadium, estimated to have traveled 525 feet. "Oh Henry" 
Rodríguez hit a ball on June 15, 1997, that bounced off the concrete ring 
in right field, caromed up to hit the roof, and came down, hitting a speaker. 
The distance traveled by this ball is also estimated at 525 feet. The longest 
home run hit to left field was Vladimir Guerrero's blast on July 28, 2003, 
that hit an advertising sign directly below the left field upper deck. 
The ad was later replaced with a sign reading "VLAD 502".[55] The Olympic 
Stadium was the home of the NASL's Montreal Manic soccer team from 1981 
to 1983. A 1981 playoff game against the Chicago Sting attracted a crowd 
of over 58,000. Several games of the 2007 FIFA Under 20 World Cup were 
played at Olympic Stadium and drew the largest crowds of the tournament, 
including two sell-outs of 55,800. Olympic Stadium hosted a CONCACAF Champions 
League quarter-final game pitting the original Montreal Impact – who played 
primarily in the adjacent Saputo Stadium – against Club Santos Laguna of 
the Liga MX (Mexico First Division) on February 25, 2009. This was the 
first time an international soccer game took place in Montreal during the 
winter months.[56] The Impact won 2–0 in front of a record crowd of 55,571.[57] 
The stadium was also home to a friendly match between the Impact and A.C. 
Milan of the Italian Serie A on June 2, 2010 before 47,861.[58] On July 
25, 2009, Olympic Stadium became the first stadium outside France to host 
Ligue 1's Trophée des Champions, a super cup played by the winner of Ligue 
1 and the Coupe de France. Over 34,000 attended the game. Bordeaux defeated 
Guingamp, 2–0. The game was held in Montreal to help Ligue 1 break into 
the growing North America soccer market.[59] On March 17, 2012, a record 
crowd of 58,912 packed Olympic Stadium to cheer on the current version 
of the Montreal Impact for their MLS debut on home soil, in an entertaining 
1–1 draw with the Chicago Fire, setting a new attendance record for professional 
soccer in Quebec.[60] That record was later broken on May 12, 2012 with 
60,860 people for a match against the LA Galaxy, also setting a new attendance 
record for professional soccer in Canada.[61] On August 24, 2014, the Olympic 
Stadium hosted the final match of the 2014 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup.[62] 
On April 29, 2015, a record crowd of 61,004 attended the final match of 
the CONCACAF Champions League between the Montreal Impact and Club América, 
establishing a new record attendance for professional soccer in Canada.[63] 
The Olympic Stadium hosted tournament matches for the 2015 FIFA Women's 
World Cup along with other stadiums across Canada.[64] One notable game 
was the semi-final match-up between the United States and Germany that 
took place on June 30, 2015, which drew a crowd of 51,176 people. The Americans 
won 2–0 in front of a largely partisan crowd and then went on to win their 
record third FIFA Women's World Cup trophy the following Sunday in Vancouver. 
Starting in 2018, the Desjardins Group plans to move approximately 1000 
of its employees into the Montreal Tower. The company plans to occupy 7 
of the 12 floors available in the tower. It is estimated that around $60 
million in renovations are required before Desjardins can move in.[65] 
Olympic Stadium hosted the 1978 World Junior Speed Skating Championships 
where they crowned the American siblings Eric and Beth Heiden as junior 
world champions.[66] In August 1979, the Olympic Stadium hosted the 1979 
IAAF World Cup in Athletics. On June 20, 1980, Roberto Durán defeated Sugar 
Ray Leonard to win the WBC welterweight championship at the Olympic Stadium. 
The Drum Corps International World Championship finals were held at this 
arena in 1981 and 1982. On September 11, 1984, Pope John Paul II participated 
in a youth rally with about 55,000 people in attendance.[67] On October 
30, 2010, the stadium played host to a special mass to commemorate the 
ascension to sainthood of Brother André. Over 30,000 people attended.[68] 
In 2017, the venue will play host to the 2017 World Artistic Gymnastics 
Championships.[69] Pink Floyd attracted the largest ever paid crowd to 
the Olympic Stadium: 78,322 persons on July 6, 1977. The second-largest 
crowd was 73,898 for Emerson, Lake & Palmer on August 26, 1977. The largest 
crowds for an opera performance were on June 16 and 18, with 63,000 to 
watch a production of Aida.[70] The stadium is directly connected to the 
Pie-IX metro station on the Green Line of the Montreal Metro. Viau metro 
station on the Green Line is also nearby. As part of the commemorative 
stamps created for the 1976 Olympics, Canada Post issued a stamp depicting
