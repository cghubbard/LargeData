Christopher Allen Hoiles (born March 20, 1965) is an American former professional 
baseball player.[1] He played his entire Major League Baseball career as 
a catcher for the Baltimore Orioles from 1989 to 1998.[1] Although his 
playing career was shortened by injuries, Hoiles was considered one of 
the best all-around catchers in Major League Baseball, performing well 
both offensively and defensively.[2] Hoiles was drafted by the Detroit 
Tigers in the 19th round of the 1986 Major League Baseball draft.[3] He 
played in the Tigers' minor league system until 1988, when he was traded 
with Cesar Mejia and Robinson Garces to the Baltimore Orioles for Fred 
Lynn.[4][5] Hoiles made his major league debut with the Orioles on April 
25, 1989 at the age of 24, but appeared in only six games with the Orioles, 
as he spent most of the season in the minor leagues with the Rochester 
Red Wings.[1][4] He appeared in 23 games with the Orioles in 1990, but 
once again spent most of the season playing in Rochester.[1][4] Hoiles 
returned to the major leagues in 1991 when the Orioles traded away catcher 
Mickey Tettleton and gave Hoiles an opportunity to be their starting catcher.[6] 
He made only one error in 89 games played as a catcher and ended the year 
with a league-leading .998 fielding percentage, becoming the fifth rookie 
catcher in major league baseball history to win a fielding title.[7][8] 
Hoiles had his best season offensively in 1993, hitting for a .300 batting 
average at mid-season.[9] Cito Gaston, the American League manager for 
the 1993 All-Star Game held in Baltimore, received criticism for naming 
Oakland catcher Terry Steinbach as a reserve player instead of hometown 
favorite Hoiles.[10] Both players were hitting .300, but Hoiles had 18 
home runs compared to Steinbach's seven.[10] Gaston explained that he was 
forced by Major League Baseball rules to name at least one Oakland player 
to the All-Star team.[10] Hoiles finished the season with a .310 batting 
average along with 29 home runs, 80 runs batted in, a .416 on-base percentage 
and a .585 slugging percentage.[1] He ranked fifth in the American League 
in slugging percentage and in on-base percentage, and finished in sixteenth 
place in balloting for the 1993 American League Most Valuable Player Award.[11][12] 
By early 1996, Hoiles' offensive production had diminished to the point 
to where the Orioles tried to drop him from the team by exposing him through 
waivers, but he managed a comeback.[13] On May 17, 1996, Hoiles joined 
the list of 23 major league players who have hit an ultimate grand slam 
when he hit a grand slam in the bottom of the ninth inning with the Orioles 
down by three runs against the Seattle Mariners.[14] Hoiles' feat was unique, 
in that he hit his home run on a full count with two outs, only the second 
time in major league history this has ever been recorded (the first was 
by Alan Trammell in 1988[15]).[16][17] Hoiles ended the 1996 season with 
25 home runs and 73 runs batted in to help the Orioles finish in second 
place in the American League East Division and capture the wild card berth, 
the Orioles' first postseason berth since winning the 1983 World Series.[1][18] 
The Orioles went on to defeat the Cleveland Indians in the first round 
of the playoffs, before losing to the eventual world champion New York 
Yankees in the 1996 American League Championship Series.[19][20] In 1997, 
Hoiles played the entire season without committing an error, leading American 
League catchers with a 1.000 fielding percentage, as the Orioles went on 
to win the American League East Division title.[21][22] The Orioles defeated 
the Seattle Mariners in the first round of the playoffs, before losing 
to the Cleveland Indians in the 1997 American League Championship Series.[23][24] 
On August 14, 1998, at Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Hoiles became the ninth 
player and the first catcher in major league history to hit two grand slams 
in one game.[25] He played in his final major league game on September 
27, 1998 at the age of 33.[1] By the beginning of 1999, the 34-year-old 
Hoiles was hampered by injuries that included a degenerative hip and a 
bad back.[26][27] On May 1, 1999, the Orioles announced that Hoiles had 
been placed on waivers, but had been offered another job within their organization.[28] 
In a ten-year major league career, Hoiles played in 894 games, accumulating 
739 hits in 2,820 at-bats for a .262 career batting average along with 
151 home runs, 449 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .366.[1] 
He led American League catchers four times in fielding percentage and ended 
his career with a .994 average, which was .004 above the league average 
during his playing career.[1] His .994 career fielding percentage ranks 
ninth all-time among Major League catchers.[29] Hoiles' career .837 on-base 
plus slugging percentage is seventh-highest all time among major league 
catchers.[30] His .467 slugging percentage is 11th highest all-time among 
major league catchers.[31] His 151 career home runs rank 12th highest in 
Orioles team history.[32] Hoiles was the Orioles' catcher on July 13, 1991, 
when four Orioles pitchers combined to pitch a no-hitter.[33] In a game 
against the Kansas City Royals on April 9, 1998, Hoiles set a major league 
record for catchers by being involved in four double plays in one game.[34][35] 
After his playing career, Hoiles returned to his alma mater, Eastern Michigan 
University, where he served as a baseball coach.[36] He later became a 
baseball coach at Bowling Green State University.[36] He was inducted to 
the Eastern Michigan University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2000.[37] Hoiles 
was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame on August 26, 2006.[38] 
On December 20, 2006, Hoiles was named as the first manager of the York 
Revolution of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.[36] 
He led the team to the playoffs, after winning the Freedom Division in 
the second half of the 2008 season.[39] He stepped down as the manager 
on August 5, 2009, citing personal reasons.[39] In April 2010, along with 
Adam Gladstone, Hoiles began his professional radio career as co-host of 
"Bird Talk", a daily baseball show heard on Baltimore's Fox 1370.[40] The 
show is a baseball-oriented talk show focusing primarily on the Baltimore
