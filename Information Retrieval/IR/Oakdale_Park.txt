Oakdale Park is a former baseball field located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 
United States. The field was home to the Philadelphia Athletics in their 
first season of the American Association in 1882. The site of the park 
had been used for amateur baseball since the Civil War. The AA Athletics 
played a single season at the park, located at Huntingdon Street (north), 
11th Street (east), Cumberland Street (south), and 12th Street (west) (in 
West Kensington),[1] relocating to Jefferson Street Grounds in 1883. The 
park was sold shortly thereafter and torn down. Baker Bowl would be built 
a couple of blocks west of this site, five years later. Coordinates: 39°59′30″N
