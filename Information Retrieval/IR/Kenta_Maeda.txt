Kenta Maeda (前田 健太, Maeda Kenta?, born April 11, 1988) is a Japanese professional 
baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Hiroshima 
Toyo Carp. He won the 2010 Eiji Sawamura Award with a record of 15–8 and 
a 2.21 ERA, with 174 strikeouts in 215 and 2/3 innings, and six complete 
games with two shutouts. He also became the youngest pitcher in Japanese 
baseball history to achieve the pitching Triple Crown in the same year. 
He won the Sawamura Award for the second time in 2015. He is nicknamed 
"Maeken" by fans and teammates (from MAEda KENta). Maeda's first professional 
year in baseball came in 2008 when he played for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 
in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). In his rookie season of 
2008, Maeda posted a 9–2 win-loss record with a 3.20 earned run average 
(ERA) in 19 games (18 starts).[1] In 2009, he was 8–14 with a 3.36 ERA 
in 29 starts.[1] In 2010, he performed even better with a 15–8 record, 
a 2.21 ERA, and 174 strikeouts in 28 starts.[1] In 2011, his record was 
10–12 while having a 2.46 ERA and 178 strikeouts in 31 starts.[1] The 2012 
season became far better for Maeda as his record was 14–7 with a 1.53 ERA 
in 29 starts.[1] In 2013, his record was 15–7 with a 2.10 ERA in 26 starts.[1] 
In 2014, he went 11–9 with a 2.60 ERA in 27 starts.[1] In 2015, he went 
15–8 with a 2.09 ERA in 29 starts.[1] He won the Sawamura Award as the 
league's best pitcher in both 2010 and 2015[2] and was the youngest pitcher 
in Japanese baseball history to achieve the pitching Triple Crown.[3] The 
Carp chose to make him available to Major League Baseball (MLB) teams through 
the posting system in December 2015.[3] Maeda competed for the Japanese 
national baseball team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic, and said he 
would use the tournament to assess his desire to compete in MLB, based 
on how he fared against their hitters.[4] Maeda started 2 games in the 
pool rounds, against China and Netherlands, amassing a 2–0 record with 
0.00 ERA, 0.30 WHIP, allowing just 2 hits, 1 walk striking out 15 in 10 
innings.[5] He was the losing pitcher in the semi-finals against Puerto 
Rico despite only allowing one run in five innings.[6] Maeda was selected 
to the all-tournament team.[7] Maeda also pitched five shut out innings 
for a Japanese all-star team in the 2014 MLB Japan All-Star Series[8] and 
he pitched in the 2015 WBSC Premier12 tournament, where he allowed two 
earned runs while striking out 14 in 12 innings.[9] On January 7, 2016, 
Maeda signed an eight-year, $25 million, contract with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers that included $10 million per year in incentives. The deal can 
come to a total of around $90.2 million throughout the course of his eight-year 
contract if Maeda reaches all of his incentives. The incentives include 
an annual roster bonus of $150,000 if he is on the 25-man opening-day active 
roster. He would receive $6.5 million annually based on starts: $1 million 
each for 15 and 20, and $1.5 million apiece for 25, 30 and 32 starts. He 
would earn $3.5 million annually based on innings pitched: $250,000 for 
90 and each additional 10 through 190, and $750,000 for 200. He enters 
the contract in his age 28 season, meaning the contract lasts until the 
end of his age 34 season.[10] The Dodgers also paid a $20 million posting 
fee to the Hiroshima Carp.[11] Maeda made his Major League debut on April 
6, 2016, pitching six shutout innings. He hit a home run off Andrew Cashner 
of the San Diego Padres in his second at-bat for his first major league 
hit.[12] He was the only Dodgers starter to remain healthy for the entire 
season,[citation needed] making 32 starts with a 16–11 record and 3.48 
ERA[13] and was selected by Baseball America to their all-rookie team.[14] 
He made three starts in the post-season for the Dodgers, losing one game 
in the Division Series and pitching two no-decisions in the Championship 
Series. He allowed eight runs in 10 2⁄3 innings.[13] He finished third 
in the voting for the National League Rookie of the Year Award behind his 
teammate Corey Seager and Trea Turner.[15] Maeda is a 6 ft 1 in (185 cm), 
175 lb (79 kg) right-handed pitcher. With a three-quarters delivery Maeda 
throws two fastballs (four-seam, two-seam) that sit in 89–92 mph (tops 
out at 95 mph[16]), an average change-up, a curveball, and an above-average 
slider in low-80s, which is his best pitch.[17] He also has excellent command, 
posting a BB/9 (walks per nine innings rate) of 1.9 in his NPB career.
