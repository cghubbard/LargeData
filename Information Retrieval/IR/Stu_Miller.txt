Stuart Leonard "Stu" Miller (December 26, 1927 – January 4, 2015) was a 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the St. Louis Cardinals 
(1952–56), Philadelphia Phillies (1956), New York/San Francisco Giants 
(1957–62), Baltimore Orioles (1963–67) and Atlanta Braves (1968). He batted 
and threw right-handed. In a 16-season career, Miller posted a 105–103 record 
with a 3.24 earned run average, 1164 strikeouts, and 154 saves in 704 games 
pitched (93 as a starter). On April 30, 1967, Steve Barber and Miller combined 
to pitch a no-hitter for the Orioles against the Detroit Tigers, but would 
lose 2–1 because of a wild pitch and an error allowing two runs to score 
in the ninth inning.[1][2] Miller was involved in one of the more memorable 
moments in All Star Game history, albeit for an exaggeration of the event 
in question. In the ninth inning of the first of two 1961 All Star Games 
(two were played between 1959 and 1962), which was played at Candlestick 
Park, a gust of wind caused Miller to sway slightly, resulting in a balk, 
which advanced Roger Maris to second and Al Kaline to third. In the embellished 
version, it is reported that the wind gust blew the 165-pound Miller off 
the pitcher's mound. Kaline later scored on an error by Ken Boyer on Rocky 
Colavito's ground ball, which tied the score at 3–3. One batter later, 
the wind caused catcher Smoky Burgess to drop Tony Kubek's foul pop-up 
for an error. Miller bailed Burgess out by striking out Kubek, and after 
Yogi Berra reached base on Don Zimmer's error, Miller got Hoyt Wilhelm 
to fly out to left to end the inning. In the top of the 10th inning, the 
defense behind Miller almost did him in; Nellie Fox walked and scored all 
the way from first on Boyer's three-base throwing error (the second by 
Boyer in as many innings) on Kaline's ground ball. Miller's teammates bailed 
him out in the bottom of the inning and made him the winning pitcher; Hank 
Aaron singled and scored on a double by Miller's Giant teammate Willie 
Mays to tie the score, then Mays scored the winning run on Roberto Clemente's 
single.[3] On May 14, 1967, he gave up Mickey Mantle's 500th career home 
run. Miller died January 4, 2015, in Cameron Park, California, aged 87
