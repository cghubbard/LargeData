Donald Raymond Bollweg (February 12, 1921 â€“ May 26, 1996) was an American 
first baseman in Major League Baseball who played for three teams from 
1950 to 1955. He was born in Wheaton, Illinois, and after signing with 
the St. Louis Cardinals in 1942, served in the United States Army during 
World War II. He finally appeared in 10 games for the Cardinals in the 
1950 and 1951 seasons, but was traded in May 1951 to the New York Yankees, 
and was named MVP of the American Association in 1952 with the Kansas City 
Blues. He played 70 games for the 1953 Yankees team which captured their 
fifth consecutive World Series title. In the 1953 Series against the Brooklyn 
Dodgers, he was used as a pinch hitter in Games 3 and 4, striking out both 
times, and as a defensive replacement for Johnny Mize in the ninth inning 
of Game 6 as the Yankees took the title. In December 1953 he was traded 
to the Philadelphia Athletics in an 11-player deal, and he shared playing 
time at first base in 1954 with Lou Limmer. After the Athletics relocated 
to Kansas City, Missouri in 1955, he appeared in only 12 games, ending 
his major league career with a batting average of .243, 11 home runs and 
53 runs batted in in 195 games. He continued playing in the minor leagues
