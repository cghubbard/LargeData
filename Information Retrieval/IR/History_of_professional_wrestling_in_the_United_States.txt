Professional wrestling in the United States, until the 1920s, was viewed 
as a legitimate sport. This view did not endure into the 1930s, as professional 
wrestling became identified with modern theatrics, or "admitted fakeness" 
("kayfabe"), moving away from being a showcase for true competition. The 
scripted nature of the art has made critics view it as an illegitimate 
sport, particularly in comparison to boxing, mixed martial arts, amateur 
wrestling, and the real sport itself, wrestling. No major promoter or wrestler 
denies that modern professional wrestling has predetermined match outcomes. 
Through the advent of television in the 1950s and cable in the 1980s, professional 
wrestling began appearing in powerful media outlets, reaching never before 
seen numbers of viewers. It became an international phenomenon with the 
expansion of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Throughout the 1990s, 
professional wrestling achieved highs in both viewers and financial success 
during a time of fierce competition among competing promotions, such as 
WWF, World Championship Wrestling, and Extreme Championship Wrestling. 
The nature of professional wrestling changed dramatically to better fit 
television, enhancing character traits and storylines. Television also 
helped many wrestlers break into mainstream media, becoming influential 
celebrities and icons of popular culture. In the United States, in the 
First Golden Age of professional wrestling in the 1940s–1950s, Gorgeous 
George gained mainstream popularity, followed in the Second Golden Age 
in the 1980s–1990s by Ric Flair, Andre the Giant, Hulk Hogan, Shawn Michaels, 
Bret Hart, Sting, The Undertaker, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Kurt 
Angle, and Triple H. Professional wrestling, in the sense of traveling 
performers paid for mass entertainment in staged matches, began in the 
post-Civil War period in the late 1860s and 1870s.[1] During this time, 
wrestlers were often athletes with amateur wrestling experience who competed 
at traveling carnivals with carnies working as their promoters and bookers. 
Grand circuses included wrestling exhibitions, quickly enhancing them through 
colorful costumes and fictional biographies for entertainment, disregarding 
their competitive nature.[1] Wrestling exhibits during the late 19th century 
were also shown across the United States in countless "athletic shows" 
(or "at shows"), where experienced wrestlers offered open challenges to 
the audience.[1] It was at these shows, often done for high-stakes gambling 
purposes, that the nature of the sport changed through the competing interests 
of three groups of people: the impresarios, the carnies, and the barnstormers.[1] 
Impresarios were the managers who chose how a wrestler could gain fame 
and interest among the fans, creating personas and improvising matches 
to make them more interesting. Carnies, who traveled and wrestled at these 
events, used tricks to protect their money and reputations during competitions, 
devising little-known and often dangerous wrestling moves, called "hooks." 
Hooks are illegal in conventional amateur wrestling, but have high rates 
of success against even the most athletic and experienced of competitors, 
essentially removing rules from professional wrestling. In addition, some 
spectators capable of beating the carnies roamed the country to compete 
in open challenges, setting side bets to make money. The barnstormers competed 
as traveling wrestlers did and often cooperated with the carnies to stage 
the matches, providing enormous profits for both sides in betting.[1] Through 
the interest in money-making among the three groups, wrestling became a 
business-oriented entertainment venue, distinguishing itself further and 
further from its authentic amateur wrestling background.[1][2] Wrestling 
performers were arranged in a pyramid hierarchy of fame and money, based 
strictly on athletic talent. The lowest were the journeymen, young performers 
with promise and some skill, but who relied mainly on showmanship to gain 
fans. The actual wrestlers, called "shooters" because of their ability 
to "shoot", or fight real matches competitively, were more successful and 
less common. At the top were the elites, or the hookers, named for their 
ability to use arcane wrestling hooks to inflict damage and serious injury 
on the competition without much effort.[1] Wrestlers considered themselves 
among a select group, and often kept the fact that their sport was commonly 
faked—to an extent—in high secrecy.[3] They used a jargon of their own 
(often shared with carnies) to communicate so the audience would not understand 
them, including the word "kayfabe."[4] During the late 19th century-early 
20th century, wrestling was dominated by Martin "Farmer" Burns and his 
pupil, Frank Gotch. Burns was renowned as a competitive wrestler, who, 
despite never weighing more than 160 pounds during his wrestling career, 
fought over 6,000 wrestlers (at a time when most were competitive contests) 
and lost fewer than 10 of them.[5] He also gained a reputation for training 
some of the best wrestlers of the era, including Gotch, known as one of 
America's first sports superstars.[5] Gotch, regarded as "peerless" at 
his peak, was the first to actually claim the world's undisputed heavyweight 
championship by beating all contenders in North America and Europe. He 
became the world's champion by beating European wrestling champion Georg 
Hackenschmidt, both in 1908 and 1911, seen by modern wrestling historians 
as two of the most significant matches in wrestling history.[5] The popularity 
of wrestling during the early 20th century was highest in the Midwest, 
where ethnic European communities, many of them German, Polish, Czech, 
Hungarian, Greek, and Scandinavian in ancestry, continued to carry on fighting 
styles practiced in their home nations.[5] At this time, during the late 
19th century, and early 20th century, the majority of wrestling was still 
competitive, and it was immensely popular. In fact, wrestling's popularity 
was second only to baseball from 1900 to the early 1920s, launching trading 
cards and competitive wrestling programs in colleges, high schools, and 
athletic clubs, legacies that have endured to the present day.[1] Wrestling's 
popularity experienced a dramatic tailspin in 1915 to 1920, becoming distanced 
from the American public because of widespread doubt of its legitimacy 
and status as a competitive sport. Wrestlers during the time recount it 
as largely faked by the 1880s. It also waned due to Gotch's retirement 
in 1913, and no new wrestling superstar emerging to captivate the audience's 
attention.[1] Following the retirement of Frank Gotch, professional wrestling—except 
in the Midwest where legitimate wrestlers such as Michigan's "Poison Ivy" 
took on all comers at State Fairs—was losing popularity fast.[6] Media 
attention focused on the illegitimacy of wrestling instead of its athleticism, 
and without a superstar like Gotch, no major personality reached a wide 
fanbase.[7] In response, three professional wrestlers, Ed Lewis, Billy 
Sandow, and Toots Mondt, joined to form their own promotion in the 1920s, 
modifying their in-ring product to attract fans. The three were referred 
to as the "Gold Dust Trio" due to their financial success. Their promotion 
was the first to use time-limit matches, "flashy" new holds, and signature 
maneuvers.[7] They also popularized tag team wrestling, introducing new 
tactics such as distracting the referee, to make the matches more exciting.[7] 
The Trio's lasting legacy, and perhaps their greatest innovation within 
professional wrestling, was the use of a regular group of wrestlers for 
a packaged show.[7] Rather than paying traveling wrestlers to perform on 
certain dates and combining wrestlers in match-ups when they were available, 
they decided to keep wrestlers for months and years at a time, allowing 
long-term angles and feuds to develop. This was the key to their success; 
they were able to keep wrestlers from their competition, and were able 
to have regular wrestling cards.[7] Their business succeeded quickly, gaining 
popularity for its freshness and unique approach to wrestling; a traveling 
stable of wrestlers.[8] The Trio gained great popularity nationwide during 
their best years, roughly 1920 to 1925, when they performed in the Eastern 
territory, acquiring fans from the highly exposed big cities.[8] The Trio 
was dealt a severe blow by Stanislaus Zbyszko, when he beat the rookie 
Wayne Munn for their world heavyweight championship, against the original 
booking.[9] Munn, who had been recruited to wrestling and pushed to the 
level of champion in only a few months, was the Trio's new star and main 
attraction. Zbyszko was supposed to lose to Munn, but refused to follow 
along, beating Munn so decisively and thoroughly that the referee awarded 
him the title to prevent a riot.[9] In addition, Zbyszko quickly dropped 
the title to Joe Stecher, a rival of Ed Lewis, making the situation worse 
for the Trio.[9] Stecher, although an able booker, was afraid of losing 
his championship, refusing to wrestle many contenders as a result. This 
made it impossible for the Trio to retrieve it. They responded by calling 
the Munn-Zbyszko match illegitimate, and reinstated Munn as champion, but 
quickly had him drop it to Lewis. This left two champions, Ed Lewis and 
Joe Stecher, who were regarded as the dominant wrestlers of the period.[10] 
Stecher and Lewis agreed to a unification match years later, in 1928, when 
Stecher gave in and lost the title to Lewis.[10] By this time, the Zbyszko 
double-cross had already caused irreparable damage, detracting from the 
Trio's dominance over the wrestling industry.[10] In addition, the build-up 
of Munn followed by such a humiliating loss had devalued his title and 
credibility as a major wrestling superstar permanently.[10] In March 1887, 
Evan Lewis defeated Joe Acton for the American Catch-as-Catch-Can championship 
in Chicago.[11] Soon, every wrestling promotion had created its own championship, 
which was considered each company's pride and glory. As promotions were 
attempting to become nationally renowned, acquiring rival championships 
marked victory. In the 1930s and 1940s, small wrestling promotions had 
fierce competition with each other, often stealing talents and "invading" 
enemy companies to win over fans. With inter-promotional matches occurring 
nationwide, the promotions were vying for dominance. In 1948, wrestling 
reached new heights after a loose confederation was formed between independent 
wrestling companies. This was known as the National Wrestling Alliance 
(NWA). In the late 1940s to 1950s, the NWA chose Lou Thesz to unify the 
various world championships into a single "World Heavyweight" title. Thesz's 
task was not easy, as some promoters, reluctant to lose face, went so far 
as to shoot title matches to keep their own champions popular with the 
fans. Following the advent of television, professional wrestling matches 
began to be aired nationally during the 1950s, reaching a larger fanbase 
than ever before. This was a time of enormous growth for professional wrestling, 
as rising demand and national expansion made it a much more popular and 
lucrative form of entertainment than in decades previous. This was called 
a "Golden Age" for the wrestling industry. It was also a time of great 
change in both the character and professionalism of wrestlers as a result 
of the appeal of television. Wrestling fit naturally with television because 
it was easy to understand, had drama, comedy and colorful characters, and 
was inexpensive for production.[12][13] From 1948 to 1955, each of the 
three major television networks broadcast wrestling shows; the largest 
supporter being the DuMont Television Network.[3] Gorgeous George became 
one of the biggest stars during this period, gaining media attention for 
his outrageous character, which was described as flamboyant and charismatic.[14] 
Already popular among wrestling fans, he became renowned after comedian 
Bob Hope noticed his performance in the Hollywood Legion Stadium in 1945 
and 1946, and began to use him for jokes on his radio station.[14] The 
publicity brought many people into wrestling events, bringing his stardom 
to a high point where promoters and television stations alike were paying 
generously for his performances.[14] Gorgeous George's impact on wrestling 
has been interpreted in many ways, demonstrating how fast television changed 
the product from athletics to performance. His legacy was the enormous 
change in wrestling personas he inspired. Before him, wrestlers imitated 
"ethnic terrors" (Nazis, Arabs, etc.), but his success birthed a more individualistic 
and narcissist form of character.[15] He was also among the first to use 
entrance music.[16] Television changed the on-screen product in many other 
ways as well. Originally, the impact of television was not well planned 
for during this period.[13] Promotional spots, which are now used as pre-match 
rants by wrestlers to warm up the crowds, were often used for simple greetings 
and welcomes to the local crowds, missing in-ring personality boosts and 
character skits during this period. No one would discuss promos before 
shooting them, and promoters usually would not spend time helping wrestlers 
in front of the camera.[14] Professional wrestlers themselves began to 
change. As popularity grew during the mid-1950s, many more wrestlers joined 
the ranks of the business, and the number of professional wrestlers over 
2,000, far more than ever before.[17] Many new wrestlers began fresh without 
notions of athletic sportsmanship that was popular in competitive arenas, 
however; they began with dreams of becoming televised superstars. This 
proved especially true as the product began to lose athletic talent, relying 
on blood and acrobatic performance.[18] Wrestling's competitiveness was 
degraded by television, a fact regarded by many in the business as a natural 
effect of television over competition. The New York wrestling office soon 
became dominant, as it refused to use competitive wrestlers, and instead 
focused on attracting televised entertainment.[19] Perhaps the first of 
the more comic book-like characters known to professional wrestling today 
was Antonino Rocca.[20] Comparatively weak in wrestling ability, his marketable 
personality and barefoot acrobatics attracted fans and made him a national 
superstar, especially popular among Italian and Hispanic fans.[20] The 
New York Wrestling office used him to revive the promotion on television, 
and found him far easier to exploit than a more athletically skilled wrestler, 
enabling the office to negotiate wrestler contracts tremendously in its 
favor.[19] By the late 1950s, professional wrestling had lost its high 
ratings, and producers, realizing that they had overexposed it, soon dropped 
most wrestling shows from their lineups.[15] The remaining televised wrestling 
promoters had small, local syndicated shows, which network producers placed 
as late-night fillers rather than signature programming.[21] Promoters 
used localized television as a weapon for eliminating the competition by 
purchasing airtime from rival territories, effectively putting them out 
of business.[22] The NWA was the most dominant wrestling body in the 1950s, 
and a large number of wrestling promotions had been under its leadership. 
Many promoters, however, viewed it as a crooked tyrant, holding back innovative 
changes in the sport. It was during this time that several promoters found 
reason to leave the organization, managing to find niches in the United 
States. The most prominent of these were the American Wrestling Association 
(AWA), which became the most popular wrestling promotion during the 1960s, 
and the New York-based World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), renamed 
WWF in 1979. As a top wrestler in the 1950s, Verne Gagne formed his own 
promotion in the NWA in 1957, which soon became the lead promotion with 
Gagne winning the World Heavyweight Championship of Omaha. After unsuccessfully 
lobbying for a title match with the NWA Champion, however, Gagne broke 
away from the NWA in 1960, renaming his promotion the American Wrestling 
Association, and making it the dominant organization of the 1960s. Named 
the AWA World Heavyweight Champion soon after, Gagne was the top wrestler, 
and engaged in many feuds with heel wrestlers, most notably Nick Bockwinkel, 
and was the AWA's top draw until his retirement in 1981. Bruno Sammartino 
carried the WWWF during the 1960s and 1970s. His brawling, power moves, 
and personal charisma helped him become the most popular American wrestler 
during this time period. During the period when MSG was the WWWF's primary 
arena, Sammartino headlined more Garden cards than any other wrestler (211), 
including 187 sellouts. The AWA was no longer the top promotion after the 
WWWF rejoined the NWA. The AWA reached new heights, however, after powerhouse 
wrestler Hulk Hogan gained nationwide attention from starring in Rocky 
III, and became a solid fan favorite. Despite Hogan being the AWA's top 
draw, Gagne would not let him be champion, believing technical wrestlers, 
like him and Nick Bockwinkel, should be the focus of a wrestling company. 
Since founding the AWA, Gagne had built the company off of technical wrestling.[23] 
Hogan left in 1983, irreparably damaging the AWA. In spite of all this, 
the NWA as a unit was still on top, and gained huge dominance through Georgia 
Championship Wrestling (GCW), becoming the first nationally broadcast wrestling 
program on cable television in 1979. It aired on the TBS network.[24] By 
1981, GCW became the most watched show on cable television.[24] The 1980s 
represented professional wrestling's greatest period of televised entertainment, 
reaching widespread popularity among American youth, as well as producing 
some of its most spectacular characters. In comparison to the declining 
support of media outlets during the 1960s and 1970s, professional wrestling, 
notably the emerging World Wrestling Federation (WWF; abridged from WWWF 
in 1979), received great exposure through its reappearance on network television. 
The WWF expanded nationally through the acquisition of talent from competing 
promotions and, because it was the only company to air televised wrestling 
nationally, became synonymous with the industry, monopolizing the industry 
and the fanbase. The WWF's owner Vince McMahon revolutionized the sport 
by coining the term "sports entertainment" to describe his on-screen product, 
admitting to its fakery as well as enhancing its appeal to children. The 
WWF became the most colorful and well-known wrestling brand to children 
because of its child-oriented characters, soap opera dramaticism and cartoon-like 
personas. Most notable was the muscular Hulk Hogan, who marked the 1980s 
with his "all-American" persona. His sheer size, colorful attire, charisma 
and extravagance made his main events into excellent ratings draws. By 
January 1984, Hogan's legions of fans and his dominant role in the industry 
was termed "Hulkamania." Hogan sold out arenas all across the United States 
and earned the WWF millions of dollars, making it the number one entity 
in all of professional wrestling; moments after Hogan defeated The Iron 
Sheik for the WWF Title, Gorilla Monsoon famously proclaimed "Hulkamania 
is here."[25] Around this time, faces and heels became a generally more 
obvious and important part of wrestling. 'Gimmicks' were more popular, 
and it widely became a popular sport again. Wrestling was generally seen 
more as a form of fun and entertainment, however, than an official sport. 
It was more about building up face/heel feuds such as Roddy Piper/Hulk 
Hogan and going into a big blow off match, which people loved. The WWF 
broke its way into mainstream entertainment and regularly brought in celebrities 
such as Muhammad Ali. The "Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection" was a period 
of cooperation and cross-promotion between the WWF and elements of the 
music industry. The WWF attracting a degree of mainstream attention with 
Cyndi Lauper joining in 1984 and WWF personalities appeared in her music 
videos.[26] Hogan gained mainstream popularity for appearing in the film 
Rocky III, reaching to an even greater level of celebrity. In 1985, Hulk 
Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling, an animated television series starring the 
character of Hogan, expanded Hogan's young fanbase.[27] Meanwhile, the 
NWA's renowned and highly successful territory system[28] was slowly dying, 
with Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) becoming the center of the entire NWA. 
While the WWF had their major stars at almost all of their shows, the NWA 
could only manage to have a few of its stars at one show at a time, so 
as to promote the product in every territory. After the WWF gained huge 
dominance with Wrestlemania, Crockett responded to the success of the WWF 
and successfully acquired time slots on TBS,[29] and would continue to 
buy out NWA promotions between 1985 and 1987 as well. The advent of nationwide 
television also weakened the system. Wrestlers could no longer travel to 
a new market and establish a new persona, since fans there already knew 
who they were. Meanwhile, McMahon took advantage of this phenomenon by 
purchasing promotions all over the continent, in order to produce a widely 
popular nationwide television program and make the WWF the only viewing 
choice. To counter the NWA's primary supercard, Starrcade, the WWF created 
its flagship show, WrestleMania, available on 135 closed-circuit networks. 
The show was a huge success with Hogan, who won in the main event, going 
on to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated.[30] After the swimsuit 
issue, it was the magazine's best seller,[31] and following WrestleMania, 
four WWF programs were among the ten most watched shows on cable television.[32] 
Professional wrestling began to become mainstream, thanks, in large part, 
to the appeal of Hulkamania among children. Large television networks also 
took wrestling into their weekly programming, including Saturday Night's 
Main Event, premiering on NBC in 1985, the first wrestling show to air 
prime time since 1955. ESPN also began airing professional wrestling for 
the first time, first airing Pro Wrestling USA shows—which were created 
as an alliance between the NWA and AWA in 1984, in an effort to counter 
the national success the WWF was gaining—and later AWA shows, after Pro 
Wrestling USA fell apart by 1986. The WWF also became an international 
success too. WrestleMania III, with a reported record attendance of 93,173 
people, is widely considered to be the pinnacle of the period.[33] The 
first episode of The Main Event is the highest rated professional wrestling 
television show to date, with a 15.2 rating and 33 million viewers.[34] 
Both had a main event featuring Hulk Hogan battling André the Giant for 
the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Following WrestleMania III, the 
WWF added to its franchise and created both the Survivor Series, to counter-programming 
against Starrcade directly on PPV, and the Royal Rumble, to counter-programming 
against the Bunkhouse Stampede originally on the USA cable networks before 
transitioning to pay-per-view in subsequent years. The NWA responded by 
creating Clash of the Champions on TBS to compete against WrestleMania 
IV. Wrestling promotions across the United States feared being forced into 
bankruptcy by the WWF. They began to unify and conglomerate under more 
centralized leadership rather than continue independently. Competing promotions 
aired better talent and attempted to regain their audiences. In late 1987, 
Continental Wrestling Association wrestler and co-promoter Jerry Lawler 
had also joined the AWA, and helped establish a relationship between the 
AWA and CWA, which was formally an NWA territory, that would be somewhat 
of a revival of Pro Wrestling USA. In 1988, the struggling World Class 
Wrestling Association (formerly known as World Class Championship Wrestling 
until it withdrew from the NWA in 1986) and Continental Wrestling Federation 
(known as Continental Championship Wrestling until it was bought out in 
1988) would also take part in this alliance, which agreed to unify the 
WCWA and AWA Heavyweight Titles at Superclash III. Superclash III was not 
a success, however, and the second Pro Wrestling USA alliance soon fell 
apart. CWA co-promoter Jerry Jarrett then bought out the WCWA and renamed 
the unified company as the United States Wrestling Association (USWA). 
Jerry Lawler also took his AWA Title to Jarrett's promotion, and the belt 
was renamed as the USWA Heavyweight Title. The AWA was able to create a 
new belt, but the end of 1990, company profits had dwindled so badly that 
the company went out of business. NWA President Bob Geigel also withdrew 
from the NWA by December 1987, and attempted to revive his Heart of America 
Sports Attractions as a national promotion known as World Wrestling Alliance, 
but would go out of business by 1989.[35] After WrestleMania III, Crockett 
also acquired the Universal Wrestling Federation—which broke from the NWA 
in 1986—and would also establish a second office in their old Dallas headquarters.[36] 
To fight the WWF's control of the industry, JCP took the NWA's pay-per-view 
names and used its best talent to draw ratings. Crockett was unable to 
beat McMahon, who took big bites out of Jim Crockett Promotions by successfully 
airing the 1987 Survivor Series and 1988 Royal Rumble on the same nights 
as Starrcade 1987 and the 1988 Bunkhouse Stampede PPV cards.[37] This left 
him with no viable option other than selling out to media mogul Ted Turner, 
who renamed the promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and continued 
to challenge McMahon's monopoly of the industry. Turner promised a more 
athletic approach to the product, making Ric Flair the promotion's marquee 
wrestler and giving young stars big storylines and championship opportunities. 
During the early 1990s, the growing WWF was being hindered by competing 
brands and nagging legal troubles. The largest troubles came from WCW, 
which competed for fans and dominated the industry during the years of 
1997 to 1998. The WWF was forced to change itself to overcome its competition, 
remodeling itself with added bloodshed, violence, and more profane, sexually 
lewd characters. This new "Attitude Era" quickly dominated the style and 
nature of wrestling to become far more teen-oriented than ever before, 
and made the WWF regain its status as wrestling's top company. The image 
of WCW changed when Eric Bischoff was appointed Executive Vice President 
of WCW in late 1993. He signed former WWF stars and departed from their 
focus on in-ring action in favor of the WWF's approach. The WWF began to 
suffer immediately and started building new stars. The Monday Night Wars 
began in 1995, when WCW started Monday Nitro, a show that ran directly 
against Monday Night Raw. While starting fairly even, the war escalated 
in 1996 with the formation of the heel stable, the New World Order. They 
helped WCW gain the upper hand when they became the most powerful group 
in professional wrestling. WCW also came up with more legitimate, edgy 
storylines and characters over the WWF's cartoon style. While the WWF and 
WCW rivalry was brewing a third promotion was growing in prominence. NWA 
Eastern Championship Wrestling renamed itself "Extreme Championship Wrestling" 
(ECW) and left the NWA. ECW adapted a hardcore style of wrestling,[38] 
and it exposed the audience to levels of violence rarely seen in wrestling. 
The unorthodox style of moves, controversial storylines, and intense bloodthirst 
of ECW made it immensely popular among many wrestling fans in the 18-to-25-year-old 
demographic. Its intense fanbase, albeit a small constituency, reached 
near-cultism in the late 1990s and inspired the "hardcore style" in other 
wrestling promotions, namely WWF and WCW. In 1998, the WWF gained momentum 
with the start of The Attitude Era. McMahon recast himself as the evil 
boss, known authoritatively as "Mr. McMahon". While an interesting character, 
it was McMahon's realistic feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin who had proven 
to be a huge money making draw for the company and become the company's 
most popular wrestler at the time that made the company finally dominate 
its competition.[39] This was probably among the best of McMahon's storylines, 
and it came at a time when Bischoff was losing his vigor in WCW's affairs.[39] 
The WWF gained infamy for its more sexually explicit, profane, and violent 
characters. Austin was the top superstar in the company, portraying a foul 
mouthed beer swilling anti-hero who regularly defied his boss; The Rock 
became a star for his cocky persona, his many catchphrases and attractive 
charisma; Mankind gained popularity for enduring extreme pain, performing 
dangerous stunts renowned among the industry today; the stable D-Generation 
X was famous for its adult themes and established star, The Undertaker, 
added to his fame because of his hardcore matches most notably with Shawn 
Michaels and Mick Foley, his gimmick which many consider to be the greatest 
in the history of professional wrestling and because of his overall dominance 
in the period in which he helped to put over new talent like Kane and win 
3 world championships in this era. Through the collective success of these 
characters, the company had finally refocused itself in the 18-25 demographic. 
By the start of 1999, both shows were consistently getting ratings of 5.0 
or higher, and over ten million people tuned in to Raw and Nitro every 
week. Wrestling continued to grow, as wrestlers made the mainstream media. 
From November 1998, the momentum was in the WWF's favor for the remainder 
of the Wars, with Raw dominating Nitro in the ratings. WCW continued its 
decline as their main eventers were in their 40s or pushing 40 and younger 
talent were never given the chance to be elevated to main event status. 
Their attempts at improving failed to turn the ratings tide, with Raw getting 
double the amount by 2000. In 2001, the WWF (renamed "World Wrestling Entertainment" 
to avoid a copyright dispute with the World Wildlife Federation in 2002 
and becoming simply "WWE" in 2011) became the dominant company in the global 
professional wrestling industry with the end of its two leading competitors, 
WCW and ECW. ECW was in dire financial straits earlier that year and Heyman 
filed for bankruptcy on April 4, 2001.[40] WCW continued to lose more money 
and finally ended on March 23, 2001 with McMahon buying out the promotion,[41] 
after more than 15 years in business and being the biggest threat to the 
WWF to date. This left professional wrestling fans with no alternative 
to WWF programming and led to some leaving the fandom. With a demand remaining 
for Southern-style, Lucha Libre, strong style and hardcore wrestling that 
WWE was not fulfilling, new promotions attempted to offer an alternative 
to cater to this niche market. The most successful among these have been 
Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and Ring of Honor, both starting up in 2002 
and Lucha Underground starting in 2014.[42] Other independent promotions 
like Chikara Pro, Combat Zone Wrestling and Pro Wrestling Guerrilla also 
began to gain more exposure. As of July 2016, the three top professional 
wrestling promotions in the United States are (in the following order): 
WWE, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, and Ring of Honor. The WWF was investigated 
by the Federal Government in 1991 for a steroid scandal where, reputedly, 
steroid use was rampant among wrestlers and in McMahon's World Bodybuilding 
Federation. Large names, including Hulk Hogan, gained infamy when news 
of their long-time steroid use was revealed.[43] In addition, a civil lawsuit 
involving sexual misconduct on the part of Pat Patterson in 1993 further 
weakened the company.[44] This gained great criticism to the WWF, weakening 
its once "family-oriented" programming. WWE gained national media coverage 
in 2007 for the Chris Benoit murder-suicide, hypothesized to be related 
to brain damage resulting from multiple concussions. This incident, along 
with the death of Eddie Guerrero in 2005, made drug use and young deaths 
in the business a subject of intense controversy. The wrestling industry 
and the nature of the business were widely criticized for this and WWE 
was affected on the business-side, with the company's stock losing approximately 
$15 million in market value in the first week.[45] Ratings also suffered
