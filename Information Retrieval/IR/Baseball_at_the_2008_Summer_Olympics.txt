Baseball at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing was held from August 13 
to August 23. All games were played at Wukesong Baseball Field, a temporary 
venue constructed at the Beijing Wukesong Culture & Sports Center. Olympic 
baseball is competed by men only, while women compete in the similar sport 
of softball. This is the most recently contested baseball tournament in 
Olympic history, as the International Olympic Committee voted to remove 
baseball from the program in the 2012 Olympics.[1] Along with softball, 
baseball was rejected for inclusion in the 2016 Summer Olympics at the 
IOC's meeting in October 2009.[2] However, following a 2016 IOC vote, baseball 
will again be conducted for the 2020 Games.[3] This was also the first 
time that the IBAF's new extra-innings rule was officially in effect, allowing 
each team to start with two base runners from the 11th inning on.[4] South 
Korea won the gold medal in a 3â€“2 final victory against Cuba. Eight teams 
are competing in the Olympic baseball tournament, and the competition consists 
of two rounds. The preliminary round follows a round robin format, where 
each of the teams plays all the other teams once. Following this, the top 
four teams advance to a single elimination round culminating in the bronze 
and gold medal games. ^1 Chinese Taipei is the official IOC designation
