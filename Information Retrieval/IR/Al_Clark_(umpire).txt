Alan Marshall Clark (born January 9, 1948) is a former professional baseball 
umpire who worked in the American League from 1976 to 1999, and throughout 
both Major Leagues in 2000 and 2001, wearing uniform number 24 when the 
American League adopted them for its umpires in 1980, then retained the 
number when the NL and AL staffs were merged in 2000. Clark umpired 3,392 
major league games in his 26-year career. He umpired in two World Series 
(1983 and 1989), two All-Star Games (1984 and 1995), five American League 
Championship Series (1979, 1982, 1987, 1992 and 1999), and three American 
League Division Series (1981, 1996 and 2000).[1] In 2001, Clark was fired 
by Major League Baseball after downgrading his first class airline tickets 
to economy class, thus either pocketing funds by selling extra tickets 
or to gain additional airline tickets for unapproved personal travel.[2] 
In 2004, he was sentenced to four months in jail and four months on house 
arrest after a memorabilia scheme resulted in a federal mail fraud conviction. 
He now is a member at Ford's Colony Country Club in Williamsburg, VA, and 
currently lives in that development.[3] Ruttman, Larry (2013). "Al Clark:
