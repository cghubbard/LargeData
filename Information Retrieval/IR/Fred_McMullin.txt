Fred Drury McMullin (October 13, 1891 – November 20, 1952) was an American 
Major League Baseball third baseman. He is best known for his involvement 
in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. McMullin was born in Scammon, Kansas in 
1891. He began his major league career on August 27, 1914, as a shortstop 
for the Detroit Tigers. He spent most of 1912–1915 in the minors before 
making the Chicago White Sox team in 1916. In 1917, he won the World Series 
with Chicago, while batting .125 in six games against the New York Giants. 
McMullin was only a utility infielder for the 1919 AL Champion White Sox, 
and as such he didn't play enough to have much potential for throwing games 
(he recorded just two plate appearances in the eight-game series). However, 
he became a part of the conspiracy when he overheard several other players' 
conversations and threatened to report them unless included. McMullin was 
also Chicago's advance scout for the World Series, which may explain how 
and why he earned an equal share in the winnings ($5,000) from the fix.[1] 
It is entirely probable that, as a means to cover himself and his co-conspirators, 
McMullin delivered a flawed scouting report to all the "clean" Sox about 
what to expect from Cincinnati's pitchers.[1] A look at the statistics 
shows little disparity between Black Sox and Clean Sox; for example, ringleader 
Chick Gandil batted .233 to future Hall of Famer Eddie Collins' .226.[1] 
For his role in the fix, McMullin was banned for life from organized baseball, 
along with seven other players, by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. 
McMullin kept quiet about the fix for his whole life. Fred held a variety 
of jobs throughout his life such as a carpenter, office jobs, traffic manager 
and Los Angeles County deputy marshal. His last years featured him suffering 
from arteriosclerosis. On November 19, 1952, just over a month after his 
61st birthday, he had a fatal stroke. His official time of death was at 
4:40 P.M on November 20. He was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery. In the
