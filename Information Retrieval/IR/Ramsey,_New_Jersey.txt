Ramsey is a borough in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. It is 
a suburb of New York City, located 26 miles (42 km) northwest of Midtown 
Manhattan. As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population 
was 14,473,[9][10][11] reflecting an increase of 122 (+0.9%) from the 14,351

from the 13,228 counted in the 1990 Census.[20] Ramsey was incorporated 
as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 10, 1908, 
from portions of Hohokus Township (now Mahwah Township). Additional territory 
was annexed from Waldwick in 1921, and portions of the borough were ceded 
to Saddle River in 1925.[21] The most noteworthy local historical site 
is the Old Stone House, which is, predictably, both old and stone, though 
its construction materials in the early 1700s also included hog's hair.[22] 
It was originally a Dutch farmhouse and served as a tavern during the American 
War.[23] Legend has it that Aaron Burr even slaked his thirst at this site, 
on his way to courting the woman who would become his wife in Ho-Ho-Kus.[24] 
The structure opened as a historic site in 1960 with a riveting display 
of old pitchers.[24] Ramsey is named after Peter J. Ramsey, a 19th-century 
landowner who died circa 1854,[25] who had sold the land that became the 
site of a railroad station called "Ramsey's" in 1848.[23][26] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 5.591

Ramsey is governed under the Borough form of New Jersey municipal government. 
The governing body consists of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising 
six council members, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan 
basis as part of the November general election. A Mayor is elected directly 
by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consists 
of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, 
with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.[7] 
The Borough form of government used in Ramsey, the most common system used 
in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council 
members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings 
and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject 
to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor 
makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments 
are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.[49][50]

Joseph Verdone (R, 2017) and Harry Weber (R, 2016).[3][51][52][53][54][55] 
In January 2015, the Borough Council selected Peter Kilman from a list 
of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to 
fill the seat expiring in 2015 that held by Deirdre A. Dillon vacant since 
she was sworn in as mayor that month.[56] In November 2015, Kilman was 
elected to serve a full three-year term.[53] Joseph Verdone was chosen 
in August 2012 to fill the vacant seat expiring in December 2014 of Bruce 
Vozeh following his resignation the previous month to become the municipal 
administrator.[57] Ramsey is located in the 5th Congressional District[58]
