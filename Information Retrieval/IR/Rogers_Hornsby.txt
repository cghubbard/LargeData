As player As manager Rogers Hornsby, Sr. (April 27, 1896 – January 5, 1963), 
nicknamed "The Rajah", was an American baseball infielder, manager, and 
coach who played 23 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for 
the St. Louis Cardinals (1915–1926, 1933), New York Giants (1927), Boston 
Braves (1928), Chicago Cubs (1929–1932), and St. Louis Browns (1933–1937). 
Hornsby had 2,930 hits and 301 home runs in his career; his career .358 batting 
average is second only to Ty Cobb's average. He was named the National 
League (NL)'s Most Valuable Player (MVP) twice, and was a member of one 
World Series championship team. Born and raised in Texas, Hornsby played 
for several semi-professional and minor league teams. In 1915, he began 
his major league career with the St. Louis Cardinals and remained with 
the team for 12 seasons; during this period, Hornsby won his first MVP 
Award and the Cardinals won the 1926 World Series. After that season, he 
spent one season with the New York Giants and another with the Boston Braves 
before being traded to the Chicago Cubs. He played with the Cubs for four 
years and won his second MVP Award before the team released him in 1932. 
Hornsby re-signed with the Cardinals in 1933, but was released partway 
through the season and was picked up by the St. Louis Browns. He remained 
there until his final season in 1937. From 1925 to 1937, Hornsby was intermittently 
his own manager. After retiring as a player, he managed the Browns in 1952 
and the Cincinnati Reds from 1952 to 1953. Hornsby is one of the best hitters 
of all time. His career batting average of .358 is second only to Ty Cobb, 
at .367, in MLB history. He also won two Triple Crowns and batted .400 
or more three times during his career. He is the only player to hit 40 
home runs and bat .400 in the same year (1922). His batting average for 
the 1924 season was .424, a mark that no player has matched since. He was 
elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1942 and the St. Louis 
Cardinals Hall of Fame in 2014. Hornsby married three times, in 1918, 1924, 
and 1957, and had two children, one from each of his first two marriages. 
Known as someone who was difficult to get along with, he was not at all 
well-liked by his fellow players. He never smoked, drank, or went to the 
movies, but frequently gambled on horse races during his career. Hornsby 
was born in Winters, Texas, the last of Ed and Mary (Rogers) Hornsby's 
six children.[1] When Hornsby was two years old, his father died of unknown 
causes.[1] Four years later, the surviving Hornsbys moved to Fort Worth, 
Texas, so Hornsby's brothers could get jobs in the meat packing industry 
to support the family.[2] Hornsby started playing baseball at a very young 
age; he once said, "I can't remember anything that happened before I had 
a baseball in my hand."[2] He took a job with the Swift and Company meat 
industry plant as a messenger boy when he was 10 years old, and he also 
served as a substitute infielder on its baseball team.[3] By the age of 
15, Hornsby was already playing for several semi-professional teams.[4] 
He also played baseball for North Side High School until 10th grade, when 
he dropped out to take a full-time job at Swift and Company.[5] While he 
was in high school, Hornsby also played on the football team, alongside 
future College Football Hall of Famer Bo McMillin.[5] In 1914, Hornsby's 
older brother Everett, a minor league baseball player for many years,[6] 
arranged for Rogers to get a tryout with the Texas League's Dallas Steers. 
He made the team, but did not play in any games for the Steers; he was 
released after only two weeks.[7] Following his dismissal, he signed with 
the Hugo Scouts of the Class D Texas–Oklahoma League as their shortstop 
for $75 per month ($1,775 today). The Scouts went out of business a third 
of the way through the season, and Hornsby's contract was sold to the Denison 
Champions of the same league for $125 ($2,958 today).[7] With both teams 
in 1914, Hornsby batted .232 and committed 45 errors in 113 games.[7][8] 
The Denison team changed its name to the Denison Railroaders and joined 
the Western Association in 1915. They raised Hornsby's salary to $90 per 
month ($2,109 today).[7] Hornsby's average improved that season to .277 
in 119 games, but he made 58 errors. Nonetheless, his contributions helped 
the Railroaders win the Western Association pennant.[9] At the end of the 
season, a writer from The Sporting News said that Hornsby was one of about 
a dozen Western Association players to show any major league potential.[9] 
Hornsby came to the attention of the St. Louis Cardinals during an exhibition 
series between that team and the Railroaders in spring training in 1915. 
Cardinals' manager Miller Huggins told his only scout, Bob Connery, to 
look for minor league players to fill the roster of their financially struggling 
team. In September, the Cardinals purchased Hornsby's contract from Denison 
and added him to their major league roster, although his only professional 
baseball experience had been in Class D.[10] Hornsby's first game came 
on September 10, when he relieved Art Butler at shortstop in a 7–1 loss 
to the Cincinnati Reds.[11] Three days later he started a game, and he 
got his first hit the next day against Rube Marquard of the Brooklyn Robins.[12] 
Hornsby finished the season with a .246 average in 57 at-bats while the 
Cardinals finished in sixth place in the National League (NL). At only 
19 years old, Hornsby was the fourth-youngest player in the NL that year.[13] 
The Cardinals picked up Roy Corhan from the San Francisco Seals of the 
Pacific Coast League to play at shortstop in 1916, making Hornsby one of 
three candidates for the position. Hornsby's great performance in spring 
training, a shoulder injury to Corhan, and poor hitting by Butler meant 
Hornsby was the starting shortstop on Opening Day.[14] He had both runs 
batted in (RBIs) in the Cardinals' 2–1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates 
that day.[15] On May 14, he hit his first major league home run against 
Jeff Pfeffer of Brooklyn.[15] He rotated among infield positions before 
finally settling in at third base for much of the second half of the year.[16] 
Late in the season, he missed 11 games with a sprained ankle.[17] He finished 
1916 with a .313 average, fourth in the NL, and he was one short of the 
league lead in triples with 15.[13] Hornsby returned to the shortstop position 
in 1917 after Corhan returned to San Francisco and Butler was released.[17] 
After playing nearly every game throughout the first month of the season, 
Hornsby was called away from the team on May 29 after his brother William 
was shot and killed in a saloon. Rogers attended the funeral on June 1 
and returned to the Cardinals on June 3, finishing the season without missing 
any more playing time.[18] His batting statistics improved from the previous 
season; his .327 batting average was second in the league, and he led the 
league in triples (17), total bases (253), and slugging percentage (.484).[13] 
Many baseball players were drafted to fight in World War I in 1918, but 
Hornsby was given a draft deferment because he was supporting his family.[19] 
During the offseason, Miller Huggins, unhappy with the Cardinals' management, 
left the team to manage the New York Yankees. He was replaced by Jack Hendricks, 
who had managed the Indianapolis Indians to a pennant in the American Association 
the previous year.[20] Hornsby lacked confidence in Hendricks's ability 
to run the Cardinals, and the two men developed animosity towards each 
other as a result of Hornsby's growing egotism and fondness for former 
manager Huggins.[21] Under Hendricks, Hornsby's batting average dipped 
to .281.[22] He had problems off the field too; on June 17, Hornsby hit 
St. Louis resident Frank G. Rowe with his Buick when Rowe stepped out in 
front of traffic to cross an intersection. Rowe sued Hornsby for $15,000 
($236,383 today), but Hornsby eventually settled for a smaller, undisclosed 
amount, and the case was dismissed.[23] He was still among the league leaders 
in triples and slugging percentage in 1918, but after the season ended 
with the Cardinals in last place, he announced that he would never play 
under Hendricks again.[22] Partially due to Hornsby's complaints, Hendricks 
was fired after the season and replaced by Branch Rickey, then president 
of the Cardinals.[24] In 1919, after the Cardinals acquired shortstop Doc 
Lavan, Rickey tried converting Hornsby into a second baseman in spring 
training. Hornsby played third base for most of the year.[25] His batting 
average was low at the beginning of the season but improved by June.[26] 
At season's end, his average of .318 was second-highest in the league, 
and he also finished second in total bases and runs batted in.[26] "Hornsby 
is the greatest hitter I've ever had to face. I've tried to fool him every 
way possible, but it just cannot be done. Personally, I don't think a more 
skillful man ever stepped up to the plate." In 1920, Rickey moved Hornsby 
to second base, where he remained for the rest of his career.[28] He started 
the year with a 14-game hitting streak.[27] On June 4, he had two triples 
and two RBIs as the Cardinals defeated the Chicago Cubs 5–1, a game that 
ended future Hall of Famer Grover Cleveland Alexander's 11-game winning 
streak.[27][29] Hornsby finished the season with the first of seven batting 
titles by hitting .370, and he also led the league in on-base percentage 
(.431), slugging percentage (.559), hits (218), total bases (329), doubles 
(44), and RBIs (94). The beginning of the live-ball era led to a spike 
in hitting productivity throughout the majors, which helped Hornsby to 
hit with increased power during the 1921 season. He hit .397 in 1921, and 
his 21 home runs were second in the league, more than twice his total in 
any previous season. He also led the league in on-base percentage (.458), 
slugging percentage (.639), runs scored (131), RBIs (126), doubles (44), 
and triples (18).[13] The Cardinals held a special day in Hornsby's honor 
on September 30 before a home game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, and 
they presented Hornsby with multiple awards before the game, including 
a baseball autographed by President of the United States Warren G. Harding.[30] 
The Cardinals beat the Pirates 12–4 that day as Hornsby hit a home run 
and had two doubles.[31] By the 1922 season, Hornsby was considered a big 
star, having led the league in batting average, hits, doubles, and runs 
batted in multiple times.[13] As a result, he sought a three-year contract 
for $25,000 per season. After negotiating with Cardinals management, he 
settled for a three-year, $18,500 contract ($261,979 today), which made 
him the highest-paid player in league history to that point.[32] He then 
became the only player in history to hit over 40 home runs and bat over 
.400 in the same season.[33] On August 5, Hornsby set a new NL record when 
he hit his 28th home run of the season off of Jimmy Ring of the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[34][35] From August 13 through September 19, he had a 33-game 
hitting streak.[36] He finished the year with a new record of 42 home runs, 
and he also set NL records in hits (250) and slugging percentage (.722, 
the highest ever for 600+ at-bat players). He won the first of his two 
Triple Crowns that year, and he led the league in batting average (.401), 
RBIs (152), on-base percentage (.459), doubles (46), and runs scored (141). 
His 450 total bases was the highest mark for any NL player ever. On defense, 
Hornsby led all second basemen in putouts, double plays, and fielding percentage.[13] 
His batting performance that year was, and still is, one of the finest 
in MLB history, and his 42 home runs are still the most ever for a .400 
hitter. On May 8, 1923, Hornsby suffered an injury to his left knee in 
a game against the Phillies when he turned to make a throw.[37] He returned 
10 days later, but the injury lingered, and he was removed from a game 
against the Pirates on May 26 to be examined by Robert Hyland, the Cardinals' 
physician.[37] Hyland had Hornsby's knee placed in a cast for two weeks, 
after which he returned to the Cardinals.[37] During a game in August, 
Hornsby was on third base late in the game and threw up his hands in disgust 
in response to a sign flashed by Rickey; he had given the current batter 
the take sign, and Hornsby felt the batter should have hit the ball.[38] 
After the game, he and Rickey fought in the clubhouse, but teammates quickly 
broke it up. Hornsby missed several games late in the year with injuries 
that the Cardinals (and Hyland) did not believe to be serious; as a result 
he was fined $500 ($6,956 today) and suspended for the last five games 
of the year.[39] However, Hornsby still won his fourth consecutive NL batting 
title with a batting average of .384. He also repeated as the leader in 
on-base percentage (.459) and slugging percentage (.627).[13] Hornsby raised 
his average to .424 in 1924, which is the sixth-highest batting average 
in a single season in MLB history, and the live-ball era batting average 
record. He led the league with 89 walks, producing a .507 on-base percentage. 
His slugging percentage of .696 again led the league, as did his 121 runs 
scored, 227 hits, and 43 doubles; he hit 25 home runs as well.[13] That 
year, the NL reintroduced its Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. Although 
Hornsby was expected to win the award, it went to Dazzy Vance instead. 
Cincinnati voter Jack Ryder left Hornsby's name off his ballot altogether 
because he believed Hornsby was an MVP on the stat sheet, but was not a 
team player.[40] In 1962, the Baseball Writers' Association of America 
presented Hornsby with an award retroactively recognizing him as the 1924 
MVP.[41] In 1925, Sam Breadon, the owner of the Cardinals, wished to replace 
Rickey as manager. Hornsby initially declined the job. After discovering 
that Rickey planned to sell his stock in the Cardinals if he was replaced 
as field manager, Hornsby agreed to take the job as long as Breadon would 
help him purchase the stock. Breadon agreed, and Hornsby became the Cardinals' 
manager.[42] Hornsby finished the year with his second Triple Crown, when 
he combined a .403 batting average with 39 home runs and 143 RBIs. He bested 
teammate Jim Bottomley in the batting title race by nearly 40 points.[43] 
That year, he won the MVP Award, receiving 73 out of 80 possible votes.[44] 
His .756 slugging percentage set an NL record.[45] The Cardinals finished 
in fourth place in 1925, finishing one game over .500, though the team 
won 64 games and lost 51 under Hornsby.[46][47] During the year, his wife 
Jeanette had a son, Billy.[48] Hornsby had an off-year offensively in 1926, 
as he hit only .317 with 11 home runs. Nonetheless, St. Louis won its first 
NL pennant. In the 1926 World Series, the Cardinals defeated the Yankees 
in a seven-game series; Hornsby tagged out Babe Ruth on a stolen base attempt, 
ending the Series and giving St. Louis its first undisputed world championship.[49] 
During post-season negotiations for a new contract, Hornsby demanded $50,000 
per year for three years. Breadon agreed to a one-year contract for $50,000 
($669,455 today). When Hornsby refused to give way, the Cardinals traded 
him to the New York Giants for Frankie Frisch and Jimmy Ring on December 20, 
1926.[50] The trade was briefly postponed as NL president John Heydler 
stated that Hornsby could not play for the Giants while he held stock in 
the Cardinals. Hornsby wanted $105 per share for his stock, a price Breadon 
was unwilling to pay. In early 1927, Hornsby was able to sell his shares 
at $105 each, enabling him to officially become a Giant.[51] Hornsby enjoyed 
a better season in 1927, as he hit .361 and led the league in runs scored 
(133), walks (86), and on-base percentage (.448). He managed the Giants 
for part of the year as well, as manager John McGraw dealt with health 
problems.[52] Hornsby's performance helped guide the Giants to a 92–62 
win–loss record during the season, which was good enough for third place 
in the NL. However, Hornsby's gambling problems at the racetrack and distrust 
of Giants' management annoyed team owner Charles Stoneham.[53][54] During 
the offseason he was traded to the Boston Braves for Jimmy Welsh and Shanty 
Hogan.[13] With the Braves in 1928, Hornsby was again the league's most 
productive hitter; he won his seventh batting title with a .387 average, 
also leading the league in on-base percentage (.498), slugging percentage 
(.632), and walks (107). One month into the season, manager Jack Slattery 
resigned, and the Braves hired Hornsby to be his replacement.[55] The Braves, 
however, lost 103 games and finished in seventh place out of eight teams 
in the NL. They were struggling financially as well, and when the Chicago 
Cubs offered $200,000 ($2,760,853 today) and five players for Hornsby, 
the Braves found the offer too good to pass up.[56] Hornsby hit .380 in 
1929 for Chicago while recording 39 home runs and leading the league with 
a .679 slugging percentage and 156 runs scored; the .380 batting average 
set a Cubs team record.[57] He also collected another MVP award, and the 
Cubs won the NL pennant. However, they lost in the 1929 World Series to 
the Philadelphia Athletics in five games, as Hornsby batted .238 with one 
RBI.[58] He also set a World Series record for strikeouts with eight.[59] 
After the first two months of the 1930 season, Hornsby was batting .325 
with two home runs. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Cardinals, 
Hornsby broke his ankle while advancing to third base.[60] He did not return 
until August 19, and he was used mostly as a pinch-hitter for the rest 
of the season. When Joe McCarthy was fired with four games remaining in 
the season Hornsby became the team's manager.[61] Hornsby finished the 
year with a .308 batting average and two home runs.[13] On April 24, 1931, 
Hornsby hit three home runs and drove in eight runs in a 10–6 victory over 
Pittsburgh.[62] Hornsby played in 44 of the first 48 games, but after a 
disappointing performance he only played himself about half the time for 
the rest of the year.[63] In 100 games, he had 90 RBIs, 37 doubles, and 
a batting average of .331. He also led the league in on-base percentage 
(.421) for the ninth time in his career.[13] The team finished 84–70, 17 games 
back of the pennant-winning Cardinals, and four games back of the Giants.[64] 
The 1931 season was Hornsby's last as a full-time player. Boils on his 
feet bothered him during the start of the 1932 season,[65] and he did not 
play his first game until May 29.[66] Hornsby played right field from May 29 
to June 10, appeared in two games as a pinch hitter, played third base 
from July 14 through July 18, and played one last game as a Cub when he 
pinch-hit on July 31.[66] William Veeck, Sr., who was running the team, 
was unhappy with Hornsby's management of the team. Hornsby maintained strict 
rules, and Veeck thought his managing style hurt team morale.[67][68] Veeck 
believed Hornsby broke a cardinal rule of baseball in one particular incident. 
Hornsby disagreed with a call made by the umpire. Instead of disputing 
the call himself, as was the manager's job, Hornsby sent another player 
to argue with the umpire. That player was ejected from the game.[69] On 
August 2, although the Cubs were in second place, Hornsby was released, 
and Charlie Grimm replaced him as manager.[68] Hornsby had played 19 games, 
batting .224 with one home run and seven RBIs.[13] Although the Cubs advanced 
to the 1932 World Series, the players voted not to give Hornsby any of 
the World Series money.[70] Hornsby did not play for the rest of 1932, 
but the Cardinals signed him as a player on October 24 for the 1933 season.[68] 
He played regularly at second base from April 25 through May 5, but he 
was used mostly as a pinch hitter with the Cardinals. On July 22, he had 
his final NL hit in a 9–5 loss to the Braves.[71] Through July 23, Hornsby 
was batting .325 with two home runs and 21 RBIs. However, the Cardinals 
chose to place him on waivers.[72] Hornsby was claimed by the last-place 
St. Louis Browns of the American League (AL) on July 26 as player-manager. 
Bill Killefer had just resigned as Browns manager, and Browns owner Phil 
Ball wanted Hornsby as a replacement.[73] Hornsby appeared in 11 games 
for the Browns. He had three hits, including a home run, in nine at-bats. 
The Browns finished in last place in the AL. That year, Hornsby began operating 
a baseball school in Hot Springs, Texas, which he ran on and off between 
1933 and 1951 with various associates.[74] In 1934, Hornsby started only 
two games, one at third base, and the other in right field. In all of his 
other appearances, he was a pinch hitter.[75] For the season, he batted 
.304 with one home run and 11 RBIs.[13] The Browns improved on their previous 
season, finishing in sixth place out of eight teams in the AL. Hornsby 
played in 10 games in the 1935 season, starting in 4. From April 16 through 
April 21, he started at first base, and he started at third base on May 22.[76] 
He finished the year with five hits and a .208 average, while the Browns 
slipped to seventh place.[13] Hornsby only appeared in two games with the 
team during the 1936 season. On May 31, his pinch-hit single in the ninth 
inning gave the Browns an 11–10 win over the Detroit Tigers.[77] In his 
other appearance on June 9, he played first base in a 5–3 win over the 
Yankees.[78] The Browns again finished in seventh place. In 1937, Hornsby 
played in 20 games. On April 21, in his first game of the year, Hornsby 
hit the final home run of his career in a 15–10 victory over the Chicago 
White Sox.[79] On July 5, he had the final hit of his career in a 15–4 
loss in the second game of a doubleheader with the Cleveland Indians.[80] 
On July 20, Hornsby appeared in what would be his final game, a 5–4 loss 
to the Yankees. A day later, Hornsby was fired as manager and released 
as a player by the Browns, who were in last place at the time of his release. 
His release was partly due to an incident with Browns owner Donald Barnes. 
On July 15, Hornsby won $35,000 ($577,095 today) from betting on a horse 
race. When he tried to use $4,000 of this money to pay off a debt to Barnes, 
Barnes refused it, since it had come from a bookmaker. Hornsby protested 
to Barnes, "The money is as good as the money you take from people in the 
loan-shark business. It's better than taking interest from widows and orphans... 
"; that made his release five days later an easy decision for Barnes.[81] 
Hornsby finished the 1937 season with a .321 batting average and 18 hits 
in 20 games, and was the oldest player in the AL that season.[13] Before 
opening his own baseball school, Hornsby was an instructor at the "Roy 
Doan Baseball School", which operated from 1934-38 at Ban Johnson Park, 
Fogel Field and Majestic Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas, the site of many 
early Spring training facilities.[82] Then, in 1939, Hornsby, started the 
"Rogers Hornsby Baseball College" in Hot Springs after Doan moved his School 
elsewhere. Hornsby ran the six-week event annually until 1952, usually 
attracting 100-200 prospects. Cy Young, Jimmie Foxx, Tris Speaker and Schoolboy 
Rowe were among the instructors for Hornsby's School. Held in conjunction 
with the baseball schools was "The George Barr Umpire School", the first 
umpire instructional school, with students under the direction of Barr, 
a Major League Umpire.[83][84][85][86] Following his release from the Browns, 
Hornsby was unable to retire because he had lost so much money gambling 
over the years.[81] He signed as a player-coach with the Baltimore Orioles 
of the International League in 1938 before leaving them to play for and 
manage the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern Association for the rest 
of the season. Hornsby then returned to the Orioles to manage them for 
1939, but he did not return to the club following the season.[87] Halfway 
through 1940, he signed to manage the Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas 
League. He led them from last place to the Texas League playoffs, where 
they fell to the Houston Buffaloes in four games. Hornsby began 1941 managing 
the Indians once again, but he resigned in the middle of the season. In 
November, he became the general and field manager of the Fort Worth Cats, 
also of the Texas league.[88] Fort Worth finished in third place and made 
the playoffs in 1942, but they were eliminated in the first round by the 
Shreveport Sports.[89] Hornsby went unsigned by any team in 1943, but he 
signed as a player-manager with the Vera Cruz Blues of La Liga Mexicana 
in Mexico in 1944. After hitting a game-winning grand slam for the second 
win of a series in March, he resigned when the team owner complained that 
the win would diminish the crowd for the third game of the series.[90] 
Following his release, he did some commentary for radio station WTMV, assisted 
the Cleveland Indians in spring training in 1947,[91] and became a TV announcer 
for Chicago Cubs games in 1949.[92] Hornsby did not become a manager or 
coach again until 1950, when he was hired to manage the Texas League's 
Beaumont Roughnecks. Beaumont won the pennant, but they were swept in the 
first round of the playoffs by the San Antonio Missions.[93] The next year, 
in 1951, Hornsby managed the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. 
Under Hornsby's leadership, the Rainiers won the pennant.[94] In 1952, 
Hornsby was again hired to manage the St. Louis Browns, his first major 
league job in 16 years. The Browns' owner, Bill Veeck, was the son of former 
Cubs president and general manager William Veeck, Sr. Hornsby was not well 
received by the players, however. On June 9, he was fired due to a disagreement 
with Veeck over an incident against the Yankees the day before. During 
the game, a fan prevented Gil McDougald of the Yankees from catching a 
fly ball, and the umpire ruled that it was fan interference. Hornsby did 
not initially argue the call, and a few minutes later Veeck forced him 
to do it (when it was already too late to do anything about it). This led 
to Hornsby and the Browns parting ways. The Browns players were so happy 
about Hornsby's firing that they gave Veeck an engraved trophy to thank 
him.[95] A little over a month later, on July 26, Hornsby was hired to 
replace Luke Sewell as manager of the Cincinnati Reds. After Hornsby completed 
two mediocre seasons with the club, the Reds announced that he would not 
return for 1954.[96] He finished his MLB managerial career with a record 
of 701–812.[47] Following his dismissal, Hornsby worked as a coach for 
the Chicago Cubs from 1958 to 1960 before becoming a scout and third base 
coach for the New York Mets in 1962.[97] In 1963, Hornsby died of a heart 
attack. He was buried in Hornsby Bend Cemetery near Austin, Texas.[13][98] 
Baseball experts and sportswriters consider Hornsby to be one of the greatest 
hitters of all time. His lifetime batting average of .358 is only exceeded 
by Ty Cobb's career mark of .367. He won seven batting titles in total, 
a feat tied or exceeded by only five players (Cobb (11 or 12, depending 
on the source), Tony Gwynn (8), Honus Wagner (8), Rod Carew (7), and Stan 
Musial (7)). Hornsby led the National League in slugging percentage nine 
times, a record that still stands. He also hit more home runs, drove in 
more runs, and had a higher batting average than any other National League 
player during the 1920s, which makes him one of four players in baseball 
history (along with Honus Wagner, Ted Williams, and Albert Pujols) to win 
a decade "triple crown".[99] He hit a career total of 301 home runs and 
was the first National League player to hit 300.[100] His 264 home runs 
as a second baseman was a major league record for that position until Joe 
Morgan surpassed him in 1984. Hornsby was also a very consistent hitter 
whether he was playing at home or on the road. His lifetime home batting 
average was .359, and his lifetime away batting average was .358. Ted Williams, 
who had the highest career batting average since Hornsby, said that Hornsby 
was the greatest hitter for power and average in baseball,[101] and Frankie 
Frisch said of him, "He's the only guy I know who could hit .350 in the 
dark."[100] Hornsby also holds second place on the unofficial major league 
record list of "consecutive games with two or more hits" with 13 games,[102] 
first place honors going to Count Campau's 15-game streak.[103] Hornsby 
is only the second right-handed batter in history to hit over .400 three 
times[104] and is considered, according to the Los Angeles Times, to be 
the greatest right-handed hitter in history.[105] He led the National League 
in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and total 
bases every year from 1920 to 1925.[13] He is one of only two players (the 
other being Ted Williams) to win the batting Triple Crown more than once, 
but only Hornsby batted .400 on both occasions. Rogers Hornsby was so respected 
as a hitter that once, when a rookie pitcher complained to umpire Bill 
Klem that he thought he had thrown Rogers a strike, Klem replied, "Son, 
when you pitch a strike, Mr. Hornsby will let you know."[106] H is for 
Hornsby; When pitching to Rog, The pitcher would pitch, Then the pitcher 
would dodge. Hornsby was also renowned for his speed, and was considered 
to be the fastest player in the National League in his prime.[105] He did 
not try to steal very often but used his speed to take extra bases. Between 
1916 and 1927 Hornsby had 30 inside-the-park home runs, and he led the 
league with 17 triples in 1917 and 18 triples in 1921; he had 20 triples 
in 1920.[13] However, Hornsby was often hard to get along with, a major 
reason he changed teams so frequently in the last decade of his career. 
He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players 
he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his 
lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did.[108][109] 
Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and 
he lost more than he won.[110] His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal 
from a team.[81] By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean 
and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude 
and dirty play.[67][111] He never went to movies or read books, convinced 
that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.[112] 
Hornsby was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1942. In 
1999, Hornsby was ranked ninth on The Sporting News list of Baseball's 
Greatest Players.[113] Later that year, he was named to the Major League 
Baseball All-Century Team.[114] In 2001, writer Bill James ranked him as 
the 22nd-greatest player and the third-greatest second baseman in baseball 
history, while at the same time documenting his unpopularity and his difficult 
personality.[115][116] He is also tied for eighth overall with Stan Musial 
in wins above replacement for position players.[13] Hornsby has also been 
recognized on the St. Louis Walk of Fame[117] In January, 2014, the Cardinals 
announced Hornsby among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted 
into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class 
of 2014.[118] On September 23, 1918, Hornsby married Sarah Elizabeth Martin, 
whom he had known since he played for the Denison Railroaders, in Philadelphia.[119] 
They had a son, Rogers Hornsby, Jr., on November 15, 1920.[120] Rogers 
Jr. died in a plane crash on December 23, 1949 near Savannah, Georgia.[121] 
During 1922 he began seeing Jeanette Pennington Hine, who was married to 
an automobile-supply salesman named John Hine.[122] On June 12, 1923, Hornsby 
divorced Sarah, and Hine divorced her spouse in 1923 as well; the two were 
married on February 28, 1924. As a result of the divorce, Sarah took custody 
of Rogers Jr.[123] Hornsby and Jeanette had a son, Billy, on June 2, 1925.[48] 
Billy played baseball for several years in the minor leagues, but never 
reached the majors.[124] Hornsby and Jeanette became estranged in December 
1944,[125] and Hornsby began seeing a woman named Bernadette Harris, whom 
he called his "personal good friend and secretary", in 1945.[126] They 
lived together after 1948, until Harris committed suicide by jumping out 
of a third-story window on September 7, 1953. The suicide was attributed 
to depression.[127] Following Jeanette's death on June 1, 1956, Hornsby 
married Marjorie Bernice Frederick Porter on January 27, 1957.[128] They
