In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the 
pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of 
retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched 
ball or draw a walk. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, 
the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the 
most important defensive player, and as such is situated at the right end 
of the defensive spectrum. There are many different types of pitchers, 
such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, 
setup man, and closer. Traditionally, the pitcher also bats. Starting in 
1973 with the American League and spreading to further leagues throughout 
the 1980s and 1990s, the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been 
given over to the position of designated hitter, a cause of some controversy. 
The National League in Major League Baseball and the Japanese Central League 
are among the remaining leagues that have not adopted the designated hitter 
position. In most cases, the objective of the pitcher is to deliver the 
pitch to the catcher without allowing the batter to hit the ball with the 
bat. A successful pitch is delivered in such a way that the batter either 
allows the pitch to pass through the strike zone, swings the bat at the 
ball and misses it, or hits the ball poorly (resulting in a pop fly or 
ground out). If the batter elects not to swing at the pitch, it is called 
a strike if any part of the ball passes through the strike zone and a ball 
when no part of the ball passes through the strike zone. A check swing 
is when the batter begins to swing, but then stops the swing short. If 
the batter successfully checks the swing and the pitch is out of the strike 
zone, it is called a ball. There are two legal pitching positions, the 
windup and the set position or stretch. Either position may be used at 
any time; typically, the windup is used when the bases are empty, while 
the set position is used when at least one runner is on base. Each position 
has certain procedures that must be followed. A balk can be called on a 
pitcher from either position. A power pitcher is one who relies on the 
velocity of his pitches to succeed.[1] Generally, power pitchers record 
a high percentage of strikeouts. A control pitcher succeeds by throwing 
accurate pitches and thus records few walks. Nearly all action during a 
game is centered on the pitcher for the defensive team. A pitcher's particular 
style, time taken between pitches, and skill heavily influence the dynamics 
of the game and can often determine the victor. Starting with the pivot 
foot on the pitcher's rubber at the center of the pitcher's mound, which 
is 60 feet 6 inches (18.44 m) from home plate, the pitcher throws the baseball 
to the catcher, who is positioned behind home plate and catches the ball. 
Meanwhile, a batter stands in the batter's box at one side of the plate, 
and attempts to bat the ball safely into fair play. The type and sequence 
of pitches chosen depend upon the particular situation in a game. Because 
pitchers and catchers must coordinate each pitch, a system of hand signals 
is used by the catcher to communicate choices to the pitcher, who either 
vetoes or accepts by shaking his head or nodding. The relationship between 
pitcher and catcher is so important that some teams select the starting 
catcher for a particular game based on the starting pitcher. Together, 
the pitcher and catcher are known as the battery. Although the object and 
mechanics of pitching remain the same, pitchers may be classified according 
to their roles and effectiveness. The starting pitcher begins the game, 
and he may be followed by various relief pitchers, such as the long reliever, 
the left-handed specialist, the middle reliever, the setup man, and/or 
the closer. In Major League Baseball, every team uses Baseball Rubbing 
Mud to rub game balls in before their pitchers use them in games.[2] A 
skilled pitcher often throws a variety of different pitches to prevent 
the batter from hitting the ball well. The most basic pitch is a fastball, 
where the pitcher throws the ball as hard as he can. Some pitchers are 
able to throw a fastball at a speed over 100 miles per hour (160 km/h; 
150 ft/s), ex., Aroldis Chapman. Other common types of pitches are the 
curveball, slider, changeup, cutter, sinker, screwball, forkball, split-fingered 
fastball, slurve, and knuckleball. These generally are intended to have 
unusual movement or to deceive the batter as to the rotation or velocity 
of the ball, making it more difficult to hit. Very few pitchers throw all 
of these pitches, but most use a subset or blend of the basic types. Some 
pitchers also release pitches from different arm angles, making it harder 
for the batter to pick up the flight of the ball. (See List of baseball 
pitches.) A pitcher who is throwing well on a particular day is said to 
have brought his "good stuff". There are a number of distinct throwing 
styles used by pitchers. The most common style is a three-quarters delivery 
in which the pitcher's arm snaps downward with the release of the ball. 
Some pitchers use a sidearm delivery in which the arm arcs laterally to 
the torso. Some pitchers use a submarine style in which the pitcher's body 
tilts sharply downward on delivery, creating an exaggerated sidearm motion 
in which the pitcher's knuckles come very close to the mound. Effective 
pitching is vitally important in baseball. In baseball statistics, for 
each game, one pitcher will be credited with winning the game, and one 
pitcher will be charged with losing it. This is not necessarily the starting 
pitchers for each team, however, as a reliever can get a win and the starter 
would then get a no-decision. Pitching is physically demanding, especially 
if the pitcher is throwing with maximum effort. A full game usually involves 
120–170 pitches thrown by each team, and most pitchers begin to tire before 
they reach this point. As a result, the pitcher who starts a game often 
will not be the one who finishes it, and he may not be recovered enough 
to pitch again for a few days. The act of throwing a baseball at high speed 
is very unnatural to the body and somewhat damaging to human muscles; thus 
pitchers are very susceptible to injuries, soreness, and general pain. 
Teams have devised two strategies to address this problem: rotation and 
specialization. To accommodate playing nearly every day, a team will include 
a group of pitchers who start games and rotate between them, allowing each 
pitcher to rest for a few days between starts. A team's roster of starting 
pitchers are usually not even in terms of skill. Exceptional pitchers are 
highly sought after and in the professional ranks draw large salaries, 
thus teams can seldom stock each slot in the rotation with top-quality 
pitchers. The best starter in the team's rotation is called the ace. He 
is usually followed in the rotation by 3 or 4 other starters before he 
would be due to pitch again. Barring injury or exceptional circumstances, 
the ace is usually the pitcher that starts on Opening Day. Aces are also 
preferred to start crucial games late in the season and in the playoffs; 
sometimes they are asked to pitch on shorter rest if the team feels he 
would be more effective than the 4th or 5th starter. Typically, the further 
down in the rotation a starting pitcher is, the weaker he is compared with 
the others on the staff. The "5th starter" is seen as the cut-off between 
the starting staff and the bullpen. A team may have a designated 5th starter, 
sometimes known as a spot starter or that role may shift cycle to cycle 
between members of the bullpen or Triple-A starters. Differences in rotation 
setup could also have tactical considerations as well, such as alternating 
right- or left-handed pitchers, in order to throw off the other team's 
hitting game-to-game in a series. Teams have additional pitchers reserved 
to replace that game's starting pitcher if he tires or proves ineffective. 
These players are called relief pitchers, relievers, or collectively the 
bullpen. Once a starter begins to tire or is starting to give up hits and 
runs a call is made to the bullpen to have a reliever start to warm up. 
This involves the reliever starting to throw practice balls to a coach 
in the bullpen so as to be ready to come in and pitch whenever the manager 
wishes to pull the current pitcher. Having a reliever warm up does not 
always mean he will be used; the current pitcher may regain his composure 
and retire the side, or the manager may choose to go with another reliever 
if strategy dictates. Commonly, pitching changes will occur as a result 
of a pinch hitter being used in the late innings of a game, especially 
if the pitcher is in the batting lineup due to not having the designated 
hitter. A reliever would then come out of the bullpen to pitch the next 
inning. When making a pitching change a manager will come out to the mound. 
He will then call in a pitcher by the tap of the arm which the next pitcher 
throws with. The manager or pitching coach may also come out to discuss 
strategy with the pitcher, but on his second trip to the mound with the 
same pitcher in the same inning, the pitcher has to come out. The relief 
pitchers often have even more specialized roles, and the particular reliever 
used depends on the situation. Many teams designate one pitcher as the 
closer, a relief pitcher specifically reserved to pitch the final inning 
or innings of a game when his team has a narrow lead, in order to preserve 
the victory. Other relief roles include set-up men, middle relievers, left-handed 
specialists, and long relievers. Generally, relievers pitch fewer innings 
and throw fewer pitches than starters, but they can usually pitch more 
frequently without the need for several days of rest between appearances. 
Relief pitchers are typically guys with "special stuff". Meaning that they 
have really effective pitches or a very different style of delivery. This 
makes the batter see a very different way of pitching in attempt to get 
them out. One example is a sidearm or submarine pitcher. Position players 
are eligible to pitch in a game as well, this however is rare as these 
players are not truly trained as pitchers and risk injury. (For instance, 
in a 1993 game, Jose Canseco suffered a season ending arm injury after 
pitching 2 innings.) Plus, they tend to throw with less velocity. For these 
reasons, managers will typically only use a position player as a pitcher 
in a blowout loss, or if they have run out of available pitchers in order 
to avoid a forfeit (the latter typically only happens in extra-inning games). 
The last position player to pitch in major league baseball was Erik Kratz 
of the Pittsburgh Pirates who pitched the ninth inning of a 15-4 loss on 
21 June, 2016. Cliff Pennington of the Toronto Blue Jays, who pitched 1/3 
of an inning in game 4 of the 2015 American League Championship Series 
en route to a 14-2 loss, is the only documented position player to pitch 
during the postseason. The only regulation game in which both pitchers 
of record were position players occurred on May 6, 2012, when the Baltimore 
Orioles' designated hitter Chris Davis was the winner in a 16-inning game 
against Boston while Red Sox outfielder Darnell McDonald took the loss. 
The pitcher's duty does not cease after he pitches the ball. Unlike the 
other fielders, a pitcher and catcher must start every play in a designated 
area. The pitcher must be on the pitcher's mound, with one foot in contact 
with the pitcher's rubber, and the catcher must be behind home plate in 
the catcher's box. Once the ball is in play, however, the pitcher and catcher, 
like the other fielders, can respond to any part of the field necessary 
to make or assist in a defensive play.[3] At that point, the pitcher has 
several standard roles. The pitcher must attempt to field any balls coming 
up the middle, and in fact a Gold Glove Award is reserved for the pitcher 
with the best fielding ability. He must head over to first base, to be 
available to cover it, on balls hit to the right side, since the first 
baseman might be fielding them. On passed balls and wild pitches, he covers 
home-plate when there are runners on. Also, he generally backs up throws 
to home plate. When there is a throw from the outfield to third base, he 
has to back up the play to third base as well. The physical act of overhand 
pitching is complex and unnatural to the human anatomy. Most major league 
pitchers throw at speeds between 60 and 100 mph, putting high amounts of 
stress on the pitching arm. Pitchers are by far the most frequently injured 
players and many professional pitchers will have multiple surgeries to 
repair damage in the elbow and shoulder by the end of their careers. As 
such, the biomechanics of pitching are closely studied and taught by coaches 
at all levels and are an important field in sports medicine. Glenn Fleisig, 
a biomechanist who specializes in the analysis of baseball movements, says 
that pitching is "the most violent human motion ever measured."[4] He claims 
that the pelvis can rotate at 515–667°/sec, the trunk can rotate at 1,068–1,224°/s, 
the elbow can reach a maximal angular velocity of 2,200–2,700°/s and the 
force pulling the pitcher's throwing arm away from the shoulder at ball 
release is approximately 280 pounds-force (1,200 N).[4] The overhead throwing 
motion can be divided into phases which include windup, early cocking, 
late cocking, early acceleration, late acceleration, deceleration, and 
follow-through.[5] Training for pitchers often includes targeting one or 
several of these phases. Biomechanical evaluations are sometimes done on 
individual pitchers to help determine points of inefficiency.[6] Mechanical 
measurements that are assessed include, but are not limited to, foot position 
at stride foot contact (SFC), elbow flexion during arm cocking and acceleration 
phases, maximal external rotation during arm cocking, horizontal abduction 
at SFC, arm abduction, lead knee position during arm cocking, trunk tilt, 
peak angular velocity of throwing arm and angle of wrist.[7][8][9] Some 
players begin intense mechanical training at a young age, a practice that 
has been criticized by many coaches and doctors, with some citing an increase 
in Tommy John surgeries in recent years.[10] Fleisig lists nine recommendations 
for preventative care of children's arms.[11] 1) Watch and respond to signs 
of fatigue. 2) Youth pitchers should not pitch competitively in more than 
8 months in any 12-month period. 3) Follow limits for pitch counts and 
days of rest. 4) Youth pitchers should avoid pitching on multiple teams 
with overlapping seasons. 5) Youth pitchers should learn good throwing 
mechanics as soon as possible: basic throwing, fastball pitching and change-up 
pitching. 6) Avoid using radar guns. 7) A pitcher should not also be a 
catcher for his/her team. The pitcher catcher combination results in many 
throws and may increase the risk of injury. 8) If a pitcher complains of 
pain in his/her elbow, get an evaluation from a sports medicine physician. 
9) Inspire youth to have fun playing baseball and other sports. Participation 
and enjoyment of various activities will increase the youth's athleticism 
and interest in sports.[11] To counteract shoulder and elbow injury, coaches 
and trainers have begun utilizing "jobe" exercises, named for Dr. Frank 
Jobe, the pioneer of the Tommy John procedure.[12] Jobes are exercises 
that have been developed to isolate, strengthen and stabilize the rotator 
cuff muscles. Jobes can be done using either resistance bands or lightweight 
dumbbells. Common jobe exercises include shoulder external rotation, shoulder 
flexion, horizontal abduction, prone abduction and scaption (at 45°, 90° 
and inverse 45°). In addition to the Jobes exercises, many pitching coaches 
are creating lifting routines that are specialized for pitchers. Pitchers 
should avoid exercises that deal with a barbell. The emphasis on the workout 
should be on the legs and the core. Other body parts should be worked on 
but using lighter weights. Over lifting muscles, especially while throwing 
usually ends up in a strain muscle or possible a tear. Other than the catcher, 
pitchers and other fielders wear very few pieces of equipment. In general 
the ball cap, baseball glove and cleats are equipment used. Currently there 
is a new trend of introducing a pitcher helmet to provide head protection 
from batters hitting line drives back to the pitcher. As of January 2014[update], 
MLB approved a protective pitchers cap which can be worn by any pitcher 
if they choose.[13] San Diego Padres relief pitcher, Alex Torres was the 
first player in MLB to wear the protective cap.[14] One style of helmet 
is worn on top of the ballcap to provide protection to the forehead and 
sides.[15] In softball, a full face helmet is available to all players 
including pitchers.[16] These fielder's masks are becoming increasingly 
popular in younger fast pitch leagues, some leagues even requiring them.
