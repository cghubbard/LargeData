William Harold Morris III (born April 9, 1965) is a former first baseman 
in Major League Baseball who played primarily for the Cincinnati Reds. 
From 2012 until 2016, he was the director of professional scouting for 
the Los Angeles Angels.[1] Morris attended Munster High School in Munster, 
Indiana, and the University of Michigan.[2] Morris was the Player of the 
Year while attending Munster High School. His Michigan team started the 
1983 campaign 33-0 and made an appearance in the College World Series. 
That team had three future Reds in Morris, Barry Larkin and Chris Sabo. 
Morris played for the New York Yankees, the Cincinnati Reds, the Kansas 
City Royals and Detroit Tigers. Morris was known for his unusual hitting 
technique, in which his feet never settled as the pitcher delivered the 
ball, so his swing was preceded by his feet shuffling towards the plate. 
Morris was not known for his power, but he had the ability to spray the 
ball to all corners of the ballpark. He also appeared on the cover of Wheaties. 
Morris was selected by the New York Yankees in the eighth round of the 
1986 amateur draft. He debuted with the Yankees on July 29, 1988 against 
the Toronto Blue Jays at Exhibition Stadium in Toronto. He collected a 
base hit in his first at bat, a single to left field against Toronto reliever 
Duane Ward. On December 12, 1989. Morris was traded, along with Rodney 
Imes to the Cincinnati Reds with pitcher Tim Leary and outfielder Van Snyder.[3] 
The trade proved beneficial for the Reds as Morris was a part of the 1990 
Cincinnati Reds, which won the World Series. He hit .340 on the year, which, 
at the time, was the third highest batting average by a rookie in 50 years. 
Also, his 136 OPS+ led the team. His sacrifice fly in game 4 turned out 
to be the series-winning RBI. While the Reds failed to repeat their Wold 
Series win in 1991, Morris had another strong season, finishing one point 
behind Atlanta's Terry Pendleton in the battle for the National League 
hitting crown. Morris ended the year at .318, while Pendleton finished 
at .319. Until Casey McGehee failed to make the All Star team in 2014, 
Morris had been the last player to be leading his league in hits at the 
All Star break and not do so. In 1994, Morris was hitting .358 with 120 
hits at the All Star break, but was not selected to the team. On November 
2, 1995, Morris became a free agent but was resigned bu the Reds on December 
6, 1995. Morris compiled a 32-game hitting streak from August 26, 1996 
to April 3, 1997. This streak is the longest by a first baseman in the 
history of Major League baseball. His .319 average at Riverfront Stadium 
was the highest by any Reds player in the history of the stadium. Morris 
was again granted free agency on October 29, 1997, signing with Kansas 
City in December of that year.[4] He stayed with Kansas City for one year, 
before again becoming a free agent. Morris re-sgined with the Reds, playing 
the 1999 season with them and part of the 2000 season. Morris was sold 
to the Tigers on July 18, 2000 and played with the for the rest of the 
season. Since 1961—the start of Major League Baseball's Expansion Era—Hal 
Morris and Derek Jeter are the only players with a minimum of 10 seasons 
in the Major Leagues who collected a game-ending RBI in their final home 
game, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Morris did it with the Tigers 
with a pinch-hit single on Oct. 1, 2000, giving his team a 12-11 win over 
the Twins, while Jeter hit a game winning single against the Orioles in 
his final appearance at Yankee Stadium on September 25, 2014. For Morris, 
this was the final at bat of his career. Morris was declared a free agent 
on November 1, 2000 and he retired. After retiring, Morris continued his 
education by graduating with an MBA from Stanford University. Morris has 
been involved in a variety of real estate and technology ventures, and 
has been an advisor to Montara Capital Partners, a boutique private equity 
firm focused on 1031 exchange and tax advantaged real estate transactions. 
Before joining the Angels in November 2011, he was a professional scout 
for the Pittsburgh Pirates for two seasons and the Boston Red Sox for one 
(2011).[5] His brother, Bobby, played professional baseball between 1993 
and 2001.[6] Morris served as the pro scouting director for the Los Angles
