Fury Gene Tenace (/ˈtɛnᵻs/; born Fiore Gino Tennaci; October 10, 1946), 
better known as Gene Tenace, is an Italian-American former professional 
baseball player and current coach in Major League Baseball.[1] He was a 
catcher and first baseman from 1969 through 1983. Tenace was drafted by 
the Kansas City Athletics from Valley High School in Lucasville, Ohio and 
played for the Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres, St. Louis Cardinals 
and the Pittsburgh Pirates.[1] He batted and threw right-handed.[1] Tenace 
was one of the top catchers of his era and won the 1972 World Series Most 
Valuable Player Award.[2] He was known for his power, especially versus 
right-handed pitching.[3] Tenace was selected in baseball's first entry 
draft, being taken in the 20th round of the 1965 Major League Baseball 
draft by the then Kansas City Athletics.[4] Tenace made his major league 
debut for Oakland on May 29, 1969 against the Detroit Tigers at Oakland–Alameda 
County Coliseum where he went 0–4 with 2 strikeouts in an 8–4 Oakland loss.[5] 
He hit the first home run of his career on June 6, 1969 at Tiger Stadium 
against Earl Wilson of the Detroit Tigers.[6] He finished the 1969 season 
with a .158 batting average, 1 home run and 2 runs batted in, appearing 
in just 38 games as a third-string catcher.[1] He continued to play the 
next two years as the third-string catcher before serving as Dave Duncan's 
backup in 1971.[7] Tenace entered the 1972 season backing up Duncan, but 
was given a chance to show his abilities by being made the team's regular 
catcher in the post-season. Tenace took full advantage of this opportunity, 
excelling in the 1972 playoffs and World Series. In the 1972 American League 
Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers, he drove in the clinching 
run in Oakland's 2–1 victory in game 5; it was his only hit of the series.[8] 
He put himself in the spotlight once again in Game 1 of the 1972 World 
Series when the Athletics faced the Cincinnati Reds. He became the first 
player to hit home runs in his first two World Series at bats and drove 
in all three runs in the A's 3–2 victory.[9] In Game 4, the A's were losing 
2–1, with their only run to that point coming on Tenace's solo home run.[10] 
A ninth-inning one-out rally consisting of four singles, with Tenace's 
the second and the rest coming from pinch hitters, won the game against 
Cincinnati's ace relief pitcher, Clay Carroll.[11] He hit a three-run home 
run in the A's Game 5 loss.[12] Before Game 6 of the 1972 Series, he was 
the target of a death threat.[13] In Game 7, he was once again the hero, 
driving in two runs in a 3–2 victory for Oakland.[14] In total, he went 
8 for 23 in the Series, with 4 home runs and nine RBI to earn the World 
Series Most Valuable Player Award.[15] Tenace's heroics helped him earn 
a full-time job in Oakland's lineup. He served as the team's starting first 
baseman for two seasons, while still serving as the backup catcher to Ray 
Fosse. He had his roles reversed in 1975, starting at catcher while backing 
up first base. As a regular starter for the A's, Tenace had a low batting 
average but a fair amount of power, hitting 20 home runs in four consecutive 
years in Oakland, finishing among the top 10 home run hitters in the American 
League each year. He further made up for his lack of a high batting average 
by sporting a tremendous batting eye. He drew over 100 walks in a season 
three times for Oakland, and led the American League in walks in 1974, 
making up for a career-low .211 average that year.[16] Statistically, his 
best year with Oakland was in 1975, when he hit a career-best 29 home runs 
and drove in 83 runs, drew 106 walks, finished 18th in the American League 
Most Valuable Player Award balloting and was selected to be the starting 
first baseman for the American League in the 1975 All-Star Game.[1][17][18] 
Also while a member of the A's, Tenace hit what turned out to be the final 
home run in the history of Kansas City's Municipal Stadium on September 
30, 1972, in a 10-5 Oakland victory over the Kansas City Royals. Tenace 
was one of several Athletics who became free agents after the 1976 season 
and participated in a newly created re-entry draft, in which teams acquired 
the rights to negotiate with veteran free agents. Tenace and teammate Rollie 
Fingers were the first players from that draft to sign, with both joining 
the San Diego Padres in December of that year.[19] In four years as a starter 
with the Padres, his power numbers dropped in part due to the cavernous 
dimensions of San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, only reaching 20 home runs 
once; but his batting eye remained, recording three more seasons of 100 
walks, with a career best of 125 in 1977.[1] In 1979, Tenace led National 
League catchers with a .998 fielding percentage, committing only 1 error 
in 94 games.[20] He recorded an on-base percentage of over .390 in each 
of his years in San Diego, and finished 3rd in the National League in that 
department in 3 consecutive years.[1] After the 1980 season, Tenace, Fingers, 
and two others joined the St. Louis Cardinals in a trade for Terry Kennedy 
and six minor league players.[19] In his two years in St. Louis, Tenace 
primarily played against left-handed pitchers, platooning with Darrell 
Porter. As a member of the Cardinals team he won the 1982 World Series, 
giving him four World Series rings.[21] Tenace played his final season 
as a utility player and pinch-hitter, appearing in 53 games for the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in 1983. He retired after being released the following year in 
spring training. Tenace became a coach after retiring as a player. He was 
touted as a possible managerial candidate during his later years. The Pittsburgh 
Pirates became strongly interested in the possibility of hiring Tenace 
as their manager to replace Chuck Tanner. When the year ended, however, 
Tanner was still the manager, so Tenace became a coach at the Major League 
level with the Houston Astros in 1986 and 1987, and later coached with 
the Toronto Blue Jays from 1990 to 1997.[22][23] When manager Cito Gaston 
was sidelined with a herniated disc in 1991, Tenace served as the team's 
interim manager, going 19–14 and keeping Toronto competitive en route to 
an eventual American League Eastern Division title.[24] He was part of 
Toronto's World Series-winning teams in 1992 and 1993, giving him 6 rings 
in 6 World Series appearances as a player and a coach. Tenace has also 
served as a hitting instructor for the St. Louis Cardinals organization.[25] 
He was re-hired as the Blue Jays' hitting coach on June 20, 2008, when 
Cito Gaston replaced John Gibbons as the team's manager. Tenace replaced 
hitting coach Gary Denbo. He was one of two members of Gaston's old coaching 
staff from his last World Series championship team who were brought back 
to the team (third base coach Nick Leyva being the other).[26] Tenace advocates 
a more aggressive approach to hitting. Under his guidance, hitters spend 
less time working the count and more time preparing to hit. He stresses 
the mental part of hitting, such as the mental preparation for what a pitcher 
will do, rather than just the physical aspect.[27] Under Tenace, the philosophy 
of hitting can be described as "Grip It And Rip It" and more of an old 
school approach to hitting.[28] Before Gaston was hired the Blue Jays had 
a record of 35–39 and since Gaston and his coaches took over the Blue Jays 
went 51–37 to finish with an 86–76 record on the season. The offensive 
improvements under Gaston are one of the reasons for the resurgence and 
as the hitting coach, Tenace has been credited with rejuvenating a stagnant 
offense. Adam Lind commented: "The thing is, a lot of people can teach 
you how to hit, but not a lot of people can teach you how to hit in the 
big leagues", referring to the major league experience of Gaston and Tenace.[29] 
Blue Jays' former center fielder Vernon Wells has said he likes the approach 
to hitting that Tenace teaches: "One thing Gene talks about is having that 
approach mentally when you go up there, in your mind you already guarantee 
yourself that one run on third, but you want to do more than that. Gene 
always says that first runner is a gimme, you should be able to come through 
in pretty much every situation like that. And then you try to do more damage 
than just that one run". In a 15-year major league career, Tenace played 
in 1,555 games, accumulating 1,060 hits in 4,390 at bats for a .241 career 
batting average along with 201 home runs, 674 runs batted in and an on-base 
percentage of .388.[1] He not only caught nearly 900 games, but also played 
first base over 600 times.[1] Tenace ended his career with a .986 fielding 
percentage as a catcher and a .993 fielding percentage as a first baseman.[1] 
He reached 20 home runs in five of his seven seasons as a regular, with 
a high of 29 in 1975.[1] After becoming an everyday player in 1973, he 
did not have an on-base average below .370 until his final year; his OBP 
was above .400 five times and over .390 (about 60 points above the league 
average) an additional three times, ending his career with an impressive 
.388 on-base percentage.[1] Six times he drew more than 100 bases on balls, 
and he led his league twice.[1] He set the American League record for having 
the lowest batting average while leading the league in walks in 1974 when 
he posted a .211 batting average with a league-leading 110 walks.[30] In 
1977, he had a .415 on-base percentage while posting a .233 batting average, 
the second lowest batting average with a .400 on-base percentage in major 
league history.[31] Less than half of his career trips to first base came 
via base hits, reaching 1,075 times through walks (984) and being hit by 
pitches (91) as opposed to only 1,060 hits. In his book, The Bill James 
Historical Baseball Abstract, baseball historian Bill James ranked Tenace 
23rd all-time among major league catchers.[32] Chuck Rosciam, a Baseball 
historian and a member of the Society for American Baseball Research, believes 
that Tenace deserves a spot in the Baseball Hall of Fame.[33] Using six 
offensive measures: Average, On-base percentage, Slugging, RBIs, Runs created 
and Win shares—all League-Era adjusted, Rosciam ranks Tenace sixth offensively 
behind Mickey Cochrane, Mike Piazza, Bill Dickey, Gabby Hartnett and Joe 
Torre among catchers. Tenace is tied for third in OPS (on-base percentage 
plus slugging percentage) with Johnny Bench and Torre. He's only behind
