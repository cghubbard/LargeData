Alexander "Álex" Luis González (born February 15, 1977) is a former professional 
baseball shortstop. González played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 
the Florida Marlins (1998–2005), Boston Red Sox (2006, 2009), Cincinnati 
Reds (2007–2009), Toronto Blue Jays (2010), Atlanta Braves (2010–2011), 
Milwaukee Brewers (2012–2013) and Detroit Tigers (2014). He was given the 
nickname "Sea-bass" while playing in Florida. He bats and throws right-handed. 
In 1999, while with the Florida Marlins, González made the Major League 
Baseball All-Star Game. In 2001, he led all Major League shortstops with 
26 errors. González played an important role in the 2003 World Series against 
the Yankees. After going 1-for-13 in the World Series, he hit a walk-off 
home run in the 12th inning of Game Four to give the Marlins a 4–3 victory 
and a 2–2 tie in the Series. The extra innings happened because Florida's 
closer Ugueth Urbina blew a 3–1 lead in the ninth. Then in Game Five, González 
hit a two-out game-tying double and scored later in Game 5, another Marlins 
victory. González added an extra run in the sixth and final game, when 
he slid around catcher Jorge Posada, eluding him and brushing the plate 
with his left hand. Florida beat the odds with a 2–0 victory and won the 
World Series. One of his most productive seasons came in 2004, when he 
posted career highs in at bats (561) and games played (159), tied a career 
high in home runs (23), yet also had a career high in strikeouts (126). 
Before the 2006 season, the Boston Red Sox signed González as a free agent 
to a one-year contract worth $3 million, plugging a hole in the starting 
lineup after the trade of shortstop Edgar Rentería to the Atlanta Braves. 
He reunited with former Marlins' teammates Josh Beckett and Mike Lowell 
who were traded from Florida to Boston earlier. González committed 32 errors 
in the two seasons (16 each), compared to the 30 committed by Edgar Rentería 
in his only season with the Red Sox. González's signing with the Sox marked 
the second time he had replaced Rentería as the shortstop; Renteria had 
just left the Marlins for the St. Louis Cardinals before González joined 
the team in 1998. On November 18, 2006, he signed a three-year, $14 million 
contract with the Cincinnati Reds.[1] In 2008, an MRI showed that Gonzalez 
still had a fracture in his left knee. He was named Player of the Week 
for the week of April 29, 2007.[citation needed][2] When González was hurt 
in February, it looked like he'd be back in the middle of April. Gonzalez 
had surgery on the knee in July, however, and ultimately missed the entire 
2008 season.[citation needed][3] On August 14, 2009, González cleared waivers 
with the Cincinnati Reds and was traded back to the Boston Red Sox with 
$1.1 million for shortstop Kristopher Negron.[4] On November 26, 2009, 
González signed a one-year deal with the Toronto Blue Jays, with a club 
option for a second year.[5] On July 14, 2010, González was traded along 
with prospects Tim Collins and Tyler Pastornicky to the Atlanta Braves 
for shortstop Yunel Escobar and Jo-Jo Reyes.[6] On December 8, 2011, González 
was signed in free agency by the Milwaukee Brewers. He signed a one-year 
deal with a vesting option for 2013 if he has at least 525 plate appearances 
in 2012. He will make $4.25 million in 2012, and would make $4 million 
in 2013. On May 5, 2012, Gonzalez was placed on the 15-day disabled list 
after suffering a right knee injury earlier in the day in a game at the 
San Francisco Giants. He was then placed on the disabled list after revealing 
that he had a torn ACL, and remained there for the rest of the season. 
During the offseason Gonzalez played in the Venezuelan Winter League for 
the Leones del Caracas. González filed for free agency after the World 
Series, but ultimately re-signed with the Brewers on a one-year, $1.5 million 
deal. He was released on June 3, 2013.[7] On January 31, 2014, González 
signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles.[8] He never 
appeared in a game with the Orioles. On March 24, 2014, González was traded 
to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for Steve Lombardozzi, Jr.,[9] who never 
played in Tigers uniform. In his Tigers debut Opening Day against the Kansas 
City Royals, Gonzalez hit an RBI-triple to tie the game in the seventh 
inning, and later hit a walkoff single in the ninth to give the Tigers
