The 1960 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 78th year in Major 
League Baseball. The team moved their home games from Seals Stadium to 
the new Candlestick Park. In their third season in the Golden Gate City, 
the Giants finished in fifth place in the National League, 16 games behind 
the World Champion Pittsburgh Pirates. The Giants selected the name of 
Candlestick Park after a name-the-park contest on March 3, 1959. Prior 
to that, its construction site had been shown on maps as the generic Bay 
View Stadium. It was the first modern baseball stadium, as it was the first 
to be built entirely of reinforced concrete.[7] Richard Nixon threw out 
the first baseball on the opening day of Candlestick Park on April 12, 
1960 and called it the finest ballpark in the country.[8] Infielders Coaches
