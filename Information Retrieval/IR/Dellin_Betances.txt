Dellin Betances (/ˈdɛlᵻn bəˈtænsᵻs/; born March 23, 1988) is a Dominican-American 
professional baseball pitcher for the New York Yankees of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). Born in Washington Heights and raised on the Lower East 
Side, Betances grew up a Yankees fan. He made his MLB debut with the Yankees 
in 2011, and was named an MLB All-Star in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Betances 
was born in Washington Heights, Manhattan. His parents, Jaime and Maria, 
emigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.[1] Jaime is 
a boxer and drives for a car service. Betances has two older brothers and 
a younger sister.[2] Spanish was Betances' first language.[3] The family 
moved to the Lower East Side when he was ten years old.[1] Betances attended 
many New York Yankees games with his family as a child. At the age of 10, 
Betances attended the perfect game of former Yankees pitcher David Wells 
in 1998, sitting with the Bleacher Creatures. He credits his family taking 
him to Yankee games with his choosing baseball over basketball.[4] He played 
baseball in the summer in the Youth Service League.[5] Betances attended 
Progress High School within the Grand Street Campus in Brooklyn, New York.[6] 
As a freshman, Betances was 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) tall, and could throw 
a fastball as fast as 85 miles per hour (137 km/h). By his junior year 
in 2005, Betances could throw upwards of 90 miles per hour (140 km/h).[1] 
In 2005, Betances was named an Aflac All-American, the first player from 
New York City to receive the honor.[2] He also played for the Team USA 
Junior National Team.[7] By his senior year in 2006, Betances was 6 feet 
9 inches (2.06 m) tall.[5] SchoolSports.com rated Betances as the tenth 
best high school prospect in 2006.[1] Betances was expected to be chosen 
in the first round of the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft.[1] However, 
he committed to attend Vanderbilt University on a baseball scholarship 
to play for the Vanderbilt Commodores and had a high signing bonus demand, 
which led him to fall in the draft. The Yankees selected Betances in the 
eighth round of the draft and gave him a $1 million signing bonus to forgo 
his commitment to Vanderbilt.[2][4] Betances was rated the Yankees' third 
best prospect for 2007,[8] and their fifth best for 2009, according to 
Baseball America.[9] He spent 2007 with the Staten Island Yankees of the 
Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League and 2008 with the Charleston 
RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic League. In 2009, he pitched for 
the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. He struggled 
with Tampa, as he pitched to a 2–5 win–loss record with a 5.48 earned run 
average (ERA) in 11 games started, before suffering an elbow injury in 
June.[10] Betances had surgery late in the 2009 season, which was erroneously 
reported as Tommy John surgery,[11] but was instead a ligament reinforcement 
procedure.[12] Betances began the 2010 season with Tampa,[10] and received 
a midseason promotion to the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League. 
Following the 2010 season, Betances was added to the Yankees' 40 man roster.[13] 
He began the 2011 season with Trenton, and was promoted to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
Yankees of the Class AAA International League on August 13.[14] On September 
8, 2011, Betances was promoted to the majors for the first time.[15] Betances 
had a pitching session in the street in front of his Teaneck, New Jersey 
home with his brother before joining up with the Yankees in Anaheim.[16] 
Betances and fellow prospect Andrew Brackman made their MLB debuts on September 
22, 2011.[17] Betances made only two appearances for the Yankees.[18] Betances 
spent the 2012 season with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. On May 10, 2013, amid 
continued struggles with command, the Yankees announced that they would 
shift Betances to the bullpen.[19] He was optioned back to Triple-A on 
May 24, 2013 after Ivan Nova was activated from the disabled list.[citation 
needed] After pitching to a 1.46 ERA with 63 strikeouts in 49 1⁄3 innings 
as a relief pitcher with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, the Yankees recalled Betances 
on August 11.[20] Betances was optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
on August 15[21] and brought back up to the majors on September 1, 2013 
when rosters were expanded.[22] Betances made the Yankees' Opening Day 
roster in 2014.[23] He was elected to his first All Star Game in 2014, 
becoming the first Yankees rookie pitcher—along with teammate Masahiro 
Tanaka—to earn an All-Star Game nod since Spec Shea in 1947.[24] On September 
17, 2014, Betances struck out Kevin Kiermaier in the eighth inning of a 
game against the Tampa Bay Rays to notch his 131st strikeout, surpassing 
Mariano Rivera's Yankees team record for strikeouts by a relief pitcher, 
set in 1996.[25] Betances did so pitching 20 innings fewer than Rivera.[26] 
Despite the physical height listed above for him in high school, Betances 
was listed on the Yankees' 2014 roster as being 6-foot-8,[27] which is 
why he chose his uniform number of 68. In 2014, Betances made 70 appearances 
out of the bullpen with a 5–0 record, a 1.40 ERA, and his 135 strikeouts 
led the majors amongst all relief pitchers. Betances finished in 3rd place 
in voting for the American League Rookie of the Year Award, behind Angels 
pitcher Matt Shoemaker and White Sox first baseman Jose Abreu. Before the 
2015 season, New York Yankees manager Joe Girardi announced that Betances 
and Andrew Miller would split the closing job to begin the season.[28] 
Although he gave up no earned runs in April,[29] his first save opportunity 
came only on May 2, when he struck out all four batters he faced, to earn 
his first save of the season.[30] He was elected to his second All Star 
game. On August 19, he struck out his 100th batter of the season, making 
it two seasons in a row in which he achieved that feat. He became the first 
Yankees reliever in franchise history to reach the 100-strikeout club in 
back-to-back seasons, needing only 64 innings to do it this year.[31] He 
finished 15th in the 2015 AL Cy Young voting. Betances was named to his 
third straight MLB All-star game. After the trades of Aroldis Chapman and 
Andrew Miller, he became the Yankees closer. For the third straight season 
Betances struck out 100 batters. Overall in 2016, Betances made 73 appearances 
with 126 strikeouts, a 3-6 record, a 3.08 ERA, and 12 saves. In 2013, Betances 
was tracked by the PITCHf/x system as having thrown a four-seam fastball 
averaging 96 miles per hour (154 km/h), a slurve averaging 82 miles per 
hour (132 km/h), and a changeup averaging 89 miles per hour (143 km/h).[32] 
He is known for his high strikeout rate. With the money Betances received 
in his signing bonus, he purchased a house for his parents in Teaneck, 
New Jersey.[4] Betances has been married to Janisa Betances since 2014.[33]
