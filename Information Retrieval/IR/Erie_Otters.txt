The Erie Otters are a Major junior ice hockey team based in Erie, Pennsylvania. 
They are members of the Midwest Division of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), 
one of only three American teams in the circuit. The "Otters" name refers 
to the North American otter (Lontra canadensis), a semiaquatic mammal common 
to Lake Erie. The Erie Otters were previously located in Niagara Falls, 
Ontario, where they were called the Niagara Falls Thunder. They moved to 
Erie Insurance Arena in downtown Erie in time for the 1996–97 season. After 
three seasons of mediocrity in Erie, they won the Midwest Division's Holody 
Trophy in 1999. It was their first of three consecutive Midwest Division 
championships, culminating in a J. Ross Robertson Cup in the 2001–02 season. 
Additionally, Dave MacQueen won the Matt Leyden Trophy in 2000–01 as the 
OHL Coach of the Year and Sherwood Bassin was awarded OHL Executive of 
the Year for his role in building a championship team as general manager. 
The Erie Otters were the second U.S. team to win the OHL Championship, 
following the 1994–95 season champions Detroit Junior Red Wings (now the 
Plymouth Whalers). Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) officially 
partnered with the Erie Otters in 2012 as their official medical provider.[1] 
Connor McDavid, a Canadian center, played for the Erie Otters from 2012 
to 2015, before joining the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League 
(NHL). The Otters chose him as their first overall pick in the OHL Priority 
Selection Draft. The NHL Central Scouting Bureau subsequently named McDavid 
the top North American prospect for the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, where the 
Oilers selected him first overall.[2][3] The Greater Toronto Hockey League 
named McDavid "Player of the Year" for the 2011–12 season following a record 
of 79 goals and 130 assists. Hockey Canada, the governing body for amateur 
hockey in Canada, granted McDavid "Exceptional Player" status, which permitted 
him to play in the OHL a year earlier than would otherwise be permissible 
for a player his age. He was only the third player to receive that status, 
after John Tavares and Aaron Ekblad.[4] The Erie Otters' colors are navy 
blue, gold, red, and white. Their primary logo features a circular outline 
with a fierce, anthropomorphic otter furnishing a hockey stick and gear. 
The "Otters" wordmark is superimposed over the design in red with gold 
and navy blue outline. The team's home uniform includes a navy blue sweater 
with red and gold accents. The away uniforms feature a white jersey with 
navy blue and red trim. For the 2013 season, the Erie Otters introduced 
a gold alternate jersey. This jersey features a navy blue shoulder yoke, 
navy blue and white stripes, and the cursive "Otters" wordmark centered 
across the chest. Its design resembles the sweaters of the defunct Erie 
Blades, who played from 1975 to 1982.[5] The Erie Otters play their home 
games at Erie Insurance Arena, which opened in 1981 and currently seats 
5,500 spectators. It is a centerpiece of the Erie Civic Center Complex, 
which also includes the Jerry Uht Park baseball stadium, home to the Double-A 
Erie SeaWolves. Dave MacQueen won the Matt Leyden Trophy in 2000–01 as 
the OHL Coach of the Year. Multiple years in parentheses A total of 21 
players have been selected at the National Hockey League Entry Draft since 
the franchise relocated to Erie, including a five-year stretch from 1997–2001 
in which seven members of the team were selected in the first round: (1997 
Jason Ward, 11th, Montreal Canadiens; 1998 Michael Rupp, ninth, New York 
Islanders; 1999 Tim Connolly, fifth, New York Islanders; 2000 Nikita Alexeev, 
eighth, Tampa Bay Lightning; Brad Boyes, 24th, Toronto Maple Leafs; 2001 
Carlo Colaiacovo, 17th, Toronto Maple Leafs; and Adam Munro, 29th, Chicago 
Blackhawks). Updated December 29th, 2015 Legend: OTL - Overtime Loss, SL
