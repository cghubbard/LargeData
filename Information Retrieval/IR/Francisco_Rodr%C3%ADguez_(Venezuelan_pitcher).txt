Francisco José Rodríguez, Sr. (born January 7, 1982), nicknamed "Frankie" 
and "K-Rod", is a Venezuelan professional baseball pitcher for the Detroit 
Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has also played for the Anaheim 
Angels / Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, New York Mets, Baltimore Orioles, 
and Milwaukee Brewers. Rodriguez pitched for the Angels from 2002 to 2008, 
and the Mets from 2009 to midway through the 2011 season. He served as 
the closer for both teams. He then pitched for the Brewers until July 2013, 
mostly in a setup role, and for the Orioles for the rest of 2013 before 
returning to the Brewers for 2014 and 2015, this time as the team's closer. 
Rodríguez holds the major league record for saves in a single season, with 
62, set in 2008. He is a three-time league leader in saves (2005, 2006, 
and 2008) and a six-time All-Star. Rodríguez is one of only six Major League 
pitchers to accumulate a total of 400 or more saves in his baseball career. 
Rodríguez signed as an undrafted amateur free agent in 1998. Originally 
a starting pitcher, Rodríguez moved to relief pitching in 2002 after elbow 
and shoulder injuries shortened his 2001 minor league season with the Lake 
Elsinore Storm. In 2002, he made his major league debut. At the time, he 
was the youngest pitcher in the American League.[1] Because of the multiple 
injuries to the Angels bullpen, the club brought him up during the middle 
of September. He emerged as a postseason relief hero, winning five postseason 
games despite never having won a Major League game before. Although he 
threw a lively fastball, his sharp-breaking curveball was his most effective 
pitch. Because Rodríguez had played very little in the Major Leagues, hitters 
in the postseason had very little idea what to expect from him, a situation 
that often favors the pitcher. In the 2002 ALDS against the New York Yankees, 
he got two victories (with 1 win resulting from a blown save). The Angels 
won the division series against the Yankees in 4 games. During the 2002 
ALCS vs the Minnesota Twins, he went 2–0 with seven strikeouts in four 
and one-third innings. The Angels won the ALCS against the Twins in 5 games. 
During the 2002 World Series against the San Francisco Giants, he had a 
1–1 record with 13 strikeouts in eight and two-thirds innings. At 20 years, 
286 days old, he became the youngest pitcher ever to win a World Series 
game. The Angels won the World Series in 7 games. In 2003, Rodríguez became 
a setup man. He gave up an earned run in 9 of his first 15 games, but rebounded 
to only allow 9 in his last 44 appearances. For the 2003 year, Rodriguez 
made 59 appearances going 8–3 with a 3.03 ERA. In 2004, Rodríguez was selected 
for the All-Star Game. On August 24, 2004, he became the sixth pitcher 
in the Angels' 44-year history to strike out at least 100 batters in a 
season without starting a game — joining Mark Clear (105 in 1980), DeWayne 
Buice (109, 1987), Bryan Harvey (101, 1991), Troy Percival (100, 1996), 
and Scot Shields (109, also in 2004). He finished the 2004 year 4–1 with 
123 strikeouts and a 1.82 ERA in 69 relief appearances. During the 2004 
ALDS, Francisco Rodriguez had 2 losses as the Angels would eventually lose 
the division series to the Boston Red Sox in just 3 games. Entering the 
2005 season, veteran Angels closer Troy Percival departed as a free agent 
which allowed Rodriguez to become the Angels' full-time closer. Rodríguez 
ended the season 2–5 with a 2.67 ERA in 66 relief appearances and tied 
the American League lead in saves with 45. Rodriguez got his first 2 career 
postseason saves during the 2005 ALDS as the Angels won the division series 
against the Yankees in 5 games. He got one save in the 2005 ALCS until 
the Angels lost the ALCS to the Chicago White Sox in 5 games. Rodriguez 
improved on his share of the 2005 American League saves title by leading 
the Majors in 2006 with 47 saves, one more than the National League leader 
Trevor Hoffman and six more than American League runner-up Bobby Jenks. 
On September 10 against the Toronto Blue Jays, he became the youngest closer 
in Major League Baseball history, at age 24, to accumulate 100 career saves. 
He accomplished this feat a year younger than the previous record holder, 
Gregg Olson. At the 2007 All-Star Game in San Francisco, Rodriguez was 
named as one of three Angels to represent the club, along with teammates 
Vladimir Guerrero and John Lackey. Rodriguez recorded the save as the American 
League defeated the National League, 5–4. Rodriguez finished the 2007 season 
5–2 with a 1.73 ERA and 40 saves in 64 relief appearances. In the 2007 
ALDS, Rodriguez pitched only 1⁄3 of an inning with an ERA accumulating 
54.00. The Angels lost the division series to the Red Sox in just 3 games. 
Rodríguez received his second career DHL Delivery Man of the Month Award 
after posting 11 saves in 12 appearances during the month of June.[2] Rodríguez 
set a major league record by recording his 35th save before the All-Star 
Break, breaking the previous record of 34 set by John Smoltz in 2003.[3] 
He was a member of the American League All-Star Team for the third time 
and made a brief appearance in the game, facing two batters while walking 
one.[4] On August 20, 2008, he set both his and the Angels single season 
record with his 48th save.[5] With his 50th save on August 24, 2008, Rodríguez 
became the first relief pitcher to reach that number since Mariano Rivera 
in 2004 and the ninth overall.[6] He was also the youngest pitcher to ever 
reach that number at 26 years, 7 months, and 17 days. In addition, he reached 
that milestone in 129 team games, faster than any pitcher in history.[7] 
With three saves during the week of August 18–24, including the milestone 
of number 50, Rodríguez was awarded the American League Player of the Week 
for the first time in his career.[8] On September 2, 2008, Rodríguez saved 
his 200th career game (54th of the season), becoming the youngest player 
in history to reach that number.[9] On September 10, 2008, while facing 
the New York Yankees, Rodríguez saved his 56th game of the season and clinched 
the American League Western Division title for the Angels.[10] On September 
11, 2008, while facing the Seattle Mariners, Rodríguez saved his 57th game 
of the season, tying Bobby Thigpen's 1990 major league record.[11] On September 
13, 2008, while again facing the Mariners, Rodríguez recorded his 58th 
save of the season, setting a new MLB record.[12] On September 20, 2008, 
Rodríguez became the first pitcher to reach 60 saves in a season when he 
closed out a 7–3 victory against the Texas Rangers.[13] Rodríguez finished 
his record-setting 2008 regular season performance with 62 saves in 69 
opportunities, appearing in an AL-leading 76 games. It was his fourth consecutive 
season of recording at least 40 saves.[14] He finished third in AL Cy Young 
Award voting and sixth in AL Most Valuable Player Award voting.[15][16] 
The Angels again faced the Red Sox in the 2008 ALDS. Rodriguez lost a game 
and the Angels would lose the series to the Red Sox in 4 games. On December 
10, 2008, Rodríguez signed a three-year, $37 million contract with the 
New York Mets.[17] Rodríguez, who had worn number 57 for his entire career, 
switched to number 75, as Mets ace Johan Santana wore number 57 at the 
time.[18] On April 6, 2009, Rodríguez recorded his first save as a Met 
against the Cincinnati Reds. On May 24, 2009, Rodríguez suffered a back 
injury and was taken to a local Boston hospital where he was given medication 
for the pain.[19] He returned to the team the next day.[19] He was selected 
to play in the 2009 All-Star game and pitched a scoreless 9th inning. On 
September 30, 2009, Rodríguez surrendered a walk-off grand slam to Justin 
Maxwell to cap a five-run ninth inning that lifted the Washington Nationals 
to a 7–4 victory over the Mets. This made him the first pitcher to allow 
two walk-off grand slams in one season since Lee Smith did in 1995 (on 
August 7, Rodriguez surrendered a grand slam to Everth Cabrera with no 
outs to cap another five-run ninth inning that gave the San Diego Padres 
a 6–2 win over the Mets). Rodríguez finished the 2009 season 3–6 with a 
3.71 ERA and 35 saves converted out of 42 opportunities. It was his fifth 
consecutive season of 30 or more saves. During his suspension-shortened 
2010 season, Rodriguez appeared in 53 games going 4–2 with a 2.20 ERA and 
25 saves. Rodriguez started the 2011 season with 42 relief appearances 
going 2–2 with a 3.16 ERA and 23 saves. On July 12, 2011, immediately following 
the All-Star Game, Rodríguez was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers along 
with cash, for Adrian Rosario and Danny Herrera. The Associated Press noted 
the Brewers had two potential closers in Rodríguez and their existing closer, 
John Axford.[20] Rodríguez expressed his unhappiness in September to being 
used as the setup man to Axford.[21] Axford finished the season with a 
streak of 43 consecutive save opportunities converted.[22] In 31 games 
for the Brewers, Rodríguez was 4–0 with a 1.86 ERA.[1] Overall for the 
2011 season, he was 6–2 with a 2.64 ERA in 73 appearances. He had 23 saves, 
all with the Mets.[1] Through 2011, he was 4th among all active pitchers 
in career saves (291) and games finished (445), and 8th in fielding percentage 
(.970).[1] Rodriguez made two appearances in the 2011 NLDS vs the Arizona 
Diamondbacks and struck out four. The Brewers won the series against the 
Diamondbacks in five games. He appeared in three games of the 2011 NLCS 
vs the St. Louis Cardinals. His ERA during the series was 3.00 and his 
new team of the Brewers would eventually lose the series to the Cardinals 
in six games. In January 2012, Rodríguez signed a one-year, $8 million 
contract with the Brewers through arbitration. The Brewers again planned 
to have Rodríguez and Axford in the bullpen, shifting between the two depending 
on who has been struggling of late.[23] In 2012, Rodriguez made a career 
high of 78 relief appearances going 2–7 with a 4.38 ERA and only 3 saves. 
On October 29, 2012, the Brewers granted Rodriguez free agency. They re-signed 
him to a minor league deal on April 17, 2013 worth $2 million plus incentives 
if he made the major league team. After a brief stint at the Brewers' spring 
training complex, Rodriguez joined the Brewers. He appeared in 25 games, 
going 1–1 with a 1.09 ERA and 10 saves before being traded in July to the 
Baltimore Orioles. On July 23, 2013 Rodriguez was traded to the Baltimore 
Orioles for minor league prospect Nick Delmonico.[24] Rodriguez struggled 
in his Orioles tenure, posting a 4.50 ERA in 23 appearances with the team. 
Overall in 2013, combined with both teams, he made 48 total relief appearances 
with a 3-2 record, a 2.70 ERA, and 10 saves. On February 7, 2014, Rodríguez 
signed a one-year deal to return to the Milwaukee Brewers.[25] Rodriguez 
was named the Brewers closer to start the 2014 season. On July 6, Rodriguez 
was selected as an All Star for the 5th time in his career, and the first 
time since 2009. On August 28, Rodriguez recorded his 1,000th career strikeout 
in a game against the San Diego Padres, becoming the ninth player among 
the Top 20 career saves leaders to also record at least 1,000 strikeouts.[26] 
Rodriguez finished his 2014 campaign posting a 5–5 record with a 3.04 ERA, 
73 strikeouts, and converting 44 saves in 49 opportunities.[27] During 
the season, he rose to tenth place on the all-time saves list.[28] On February 
27, 2015, the Brewers re-signed Rodriguez a two-year, $13M deal.[29] Milwaukee 
also holds a club option for the 2017 season. Rodriguez will be paid $3.5M 
in 2015 and $5.5M in 2016. The deal also includes a $2M deferral and a 
$2M buyout on the Brewers' 2017 club option worth $6M. On July 6, Rodríguez 
was selected as an All Star for a second consecutive season and for the 
6th time in his career. During the season, Rodríguez moved up three places 
on the all-time MLB saves list. On June 8, Rodríguez recorded his 359th 
career save, moving him past Troy Percival and into ninth place on the 
all-time list.[30] On July 17, he recorded his 368th career save, passing 
Jeff Reardon for eighth place on the list. On August 19, Rodríguez recorded 
save number 378, passing Joe Nathan for seventh place on the all-time list, 
while also making him the major leagues' active career saves leader. On 
September 27, Rodríguez finished his 600th career game, becoming only the 
17th pitcher all time to finish 600 games. He finished the season with 
a 1-3 record and a 2.21 ERA. He made 55 relief appearances and had 38 saves 
in 40 save chances. On November 18, 2015, Rodríguez was traded to the Detroit 
Tigers in exchange for Javier Betancourt and Manny Piña.[31][32] During 
the 2015–16 offseason, Rodríguez contracted the Zika virus while in his 
native Venezuela. He said it took two months before he "ultimately felt 
like himself again" and he still felt lingering effects in spring training.[33] 
On April 28, Rodríguez recorded his 391st career save, passing Dennis Eckersley 
for sixth all time in saves. On May 24, Rodríguez recorded his 400th career 
save, becoming just the sixth pitcher in Major League Baseball history 
to reach the milestone.[34] On August 29, 2016, Rodríguez recorded his 
423rd career save, passing Billy Wagner for fifth all time in saves. On 
September 5, Rodríguez recorded his 425th career save, passing John Franco 
for fourth place on the all-time saves list.[35] Rodríguez appeared in 
61 games for the 2016 Tigers, posting a 3.24 ERA with 44 saves in 49 save 
chances. For the first time in his career, he had fewer strikeouts (52) 
than innings pitched ( 58 1⁄3). Following the 2016 season, the Tigers exercised 
the $6 million club option to bring back Rodríguez for the 2017 season.[36] 
Rodríguez throws four pitches. He came up throwing a hard four-seam fastball 
that averaged 95 mph in 2007, but the pitch has settled in the 89–92 mph 
range through the 2016 season. He also throws a two-seam fastball at 88–91 mph. 
His off-speed pitches are a curveball at 76–79 mph and a changeup at 82–85 mph. 
He uses his changeup more against left-handed hitters.[37] It has a whiff 
rate of 48% since 2007, the third-highest among all changeups thrown by 
relief pitchers.[38] Rodríguez has been a strikeout pitcher throughout 
his career, compiling an average of 10.6 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched 
through the 2016 season.[39] Rodríguez's nickname of "K-Rod" became popular 
during the 2002 playoffs.[40] It is a play on "A-Rod", the nickname of 
New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez, with "K" representing the 
common abbreviation for strikeout. Rodríguez is a practitioner of the Santería 
religion.[41] Rodríguez has competed in the 2006 and 2009 World Baseball 
Classic for the Venezuelan team with his former teammate Johan Santana. 
Rodriguez has 9 children. On June 13, 2009, New York Yankees reliever Brian 
Bruney criticized Rodríguez, calling his antics on the mound "unbelievable" 
and saying that Rodriguez has "got a tired act", after seeing his reaction 
to earning a blown save in 2009 against the Yankees where teammate Luis 
Castillo dropped a pop-up with two outs in the ninth inning allowing the 
Yankees to score the winning run. Rodríguez responded by saying "somebody 
like that, it doesn't bother me", and suggesting that Bruney "better keep 
his mouth shut and do his job, not worry about somebody else. I don't even 
know who the guy is. I'm not going to waste my time with that guy. Instead 
of sending messages through the paper, next time when you see me at Citi 
Field, come up to me and say it to my face."[42] During batting practice 
the following day Rodríguez confronted Bruney on the field, pointing and 
shouting at him before teammates from both sides separated the two.[43] 
In May 2010, Rodríguez and bullpen coach Randy Niemann got into a heated 
exchange while the pitcher was preparing to enter a game. Mets manager 
Jerry Manuel later said the matter was resolved, without saying what caused 
the dispute.[44] On August 11, 2010, Rodríguez was arrested after allegedly 
assaulting Carlos Peña, the father of his girlfriend Daian Pena after the 
Mets lost a game at Citi Field. Rodríguez was reportedly upset that he 
made disparaging remarks about Rodríguez's mother.[45] Rodríguez remained 
in police custody at Citi Field on a charge of third-degree assault, a 
misdemeanor in the state of New York, and was arraigned that afternoon.[46][47] 
He was released without bail, and ordered by a judge to stay away from 
his girlfriend and her father. The Mets suspended him and placed him on 
the team's restricted list for two days, which meant he would forfeit two 
games' salary. "Ownership and the organization are very disappointed in 
Francisco's inappropriate behavior and we take the matter very seriously", 
team chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon said.[44] Rodríguez suffered a 
torn ligament in his right thumb, possibly during the altercation, requiring 
season-ending surgery.[48] The Mets placed Rodríguez on the disqualified 
list, preventing him from attending or performing any activity with the 
team, as well as having his pay suspended until he was physically able 
to perform again.[49] On September 22, 2010, Rodriguez was back in Queens 
Criminal Court facing seven counts of criminal contempt after sending numerous 
text messages to Daian Pena in violation of the order of protection. The 
judge imposed bail of $7,500, which Rodriguez posted.[50] Rodriguez was 
charged with domestic violence in Wisconsin relating to a September 17, 
2012, incident in which he allegedly hit and kicked the mother of his child. 
He was facing a fine of $10,000 and/or up to 9 months in prison.[51] Charges 
were subsequently dropped against Rodriguez when the victim and the eyewitness 
(housekeeper) both returned to Venezuela and did not respond to the district
