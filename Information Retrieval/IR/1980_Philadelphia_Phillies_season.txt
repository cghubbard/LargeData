The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies season was a season in American baseball. 
The team finished with a regular-season record of 91 wins and 71 losses, 
which was good enough to regain the National League East title by just 
one game over the Montreal Expos. The Phillies went on to defeat the Houston 
Astros in the NLCS to gain their first NL title since 1950, then defeated 
the Kansas City Royals to win their first-ever World Series Championship, 
in the team's 98th season. The 1980 Phillies were known as "The Cardiac 
Kids" because of the many close games that were almost blown.[citation

1903, the National and American Leagues each had eight teams. With their 
victory in the 1980 World Series, the Phillies became the last of the "Original 
Sixteen" franchises to win a Series.[citation needed] The 1980 World Series 
was the first World Series to be played entirely on artificial turf. Prior 
to 1980, the Phillies hadn't won a World Series game since Game 1 of the 
1915 World Series against the Boston Red Sox. The series offered many intriguing 
storylines. Phillies pitcher Bob Walk became the first rookie to start 
the first game of a World Series since Joe Black of the Brooklyn Dodgers 
in 1952. The 1980 World Series was the first of numerous World Series that 
journeyman outfielder Lonnie Smith (then with the Phillies) participated 
in. He was also a part of the 1982 World Series (as a member of the St. 
Louis Cardinals), 1985 World Series (as a member of the Kansas City Royals), 
and the 1991 and 1992 World Series as a member of the Atlanta Braves. Game 
6 would be the culmination for the Phillies' first championship. Philadelphia 
scored two in the third on a Mike Schmidt single. It was all that Steve 
Carlton and Tug McGraw would need for the 4-1 win. Kansas City threatened 
by loading the bases in the eighth and the ninth innings before Tug McGraw 
struck out Willie Wilson for the third out in the final inning. While Mike 
Schmidt was the official MVP of the 1980 World Series, the Babe Ruth Award 
(another World Series MVP) was given to Tug McGraw. As of 2011, this is 
the last World Series in which both participating franchises had yet to 
win a World Series in their history. This was the first time that had happened 
since 1920.[citation needed] The entire state of Pennsylvania, not just 
Philadelphia, celebrated the Phillies' win.[25] Minutes after the final 
out, Governor Dick Thornburgh declared the next day "Philadelphia Phillies 
Day."[25][26] NL Philadelphia Phillies (4) vs. AL Kansas City Royals (2)

Player Award in a unanimous vote. He led the league in home runs with 48 
(by a margin of 13 over his nearest competitor). Schmidt was also selected 
as MVP of the World Series, after hitting two homers and driving in seven 
runs as his team won their first World Series Championship over the George 
Brett-led Kansas City Royals. Steve Carlton received the National League 
Cy Young Award. Tug McGraw received the Babe Ruth Award. Manny Trillo was 
honored as the MVP of the National League Championship Series. 1980 Major
