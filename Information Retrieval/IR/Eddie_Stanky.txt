As player As manager Edward Raymond Stanky (September 3, 1915 – June 6, 
1999[1]), nicknamed "The Brat", was an American professional baseball player 
and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a second baseman for 
the Chicago Cubs (1943–44), Brooklyn Dodgers (1944–47), Boston Braves (1948–49), 
New York Giants (1950–51) and St. Louis Cardinals (1952–53). He was born 
in Philadelphia, and his original nickname, "The Brat from Kensington", 
is in reference to the neighborhood where he grew up.[2] It took Stanky 
eight years to reach the major leagues at age 27, after starting out at 
Greenville, Mississippi, in the East Dixie League, where he was a teammate 
of future St. Louis Cardinals star Harry Brecheen, whom Stanky would manage 
in St. Louis in 1952. Stanky was famous for his ability to draw walks; 
he drew 100 or more walks in each of six different seasons, 140 or more 
in two of them. In 1946, he hit just .273 but his 137 walks allowed him 
to lead the league in OBP with .436, edging out Stan Musial—who led in 
more than ten hitting categories. His best season was probably 1950 with 
the Giants, when he hit an even .300 and led the league in walks (144) 
and OBP (.460). On August 30, he tied a major league record when he walked 
in seven consecutive at-bats (in two games). Leo Durocher, who managed 
him with the Dodgers and Giants, once summed up Stanky's talents: "He can't 
hit, can't run, can't field. He's no nice guy ... all the little SOB can 
do is win." Yankee shortstop Phil Rizzuto still complained years later 
about a notorious play during Game 3 of the 1951 World Series in which 
Stanky kicked the ball loose from Rizzuto's glove as he slid into second 
base, instrumental in the Giant win that put them ahead two games to one, 
although they lost the next three and the Series with it. As a runner at 
third base with less than two out, he would station himself several feet 
back of the bag, in shallow left field. He would time the arc of any outfield 
fly and then take off running, step on third as the catch was being made 
and continue to run at full speed, making it almost impossible to throw 
him out at home, a tactic eventually outlawed as a result. He was also 
(in)famous for what came to be called "the Stanky maneuver", distracting 
opposing hitters by jumping up and down and waving his arms behind the 
pitcher from his second base position. Stanky was also a master of the 
"delayed steal" in which the runner feigns disinterest after the pitch; 
but instead of walking back to first breaks for second as soon as the infielders 
return to their normal positions. As Cardinal player-manager, he would 
hold up games close to being called on account of darkness or curfew when 
that would benefit his team, by walking leisurely to the mound from second 
base or the dugout (when not playing) after every pitch to confer with 
his pitcher, eventually resulting in the one-trip-per-inning rule. Stanky 
contributed to the breaking of the color barrier as a member of the Brooklyn 
Dodgers in 1947. When Jackie Robinson joined the Dodgers, he was treated 
harshly and discriminated against. Stanky stayed silent at first, but finally 
yelled back at Ben Chapman's racist insults during a game. Not long afterward, 
the other Dodgers began to stand up for Robinson as well.[3] The incident 
is portrayed in the film 42. Stanky is played by Jesse Luken. Robinson, 
a natural second baseman, was shifted to first base in his rookie season 
as Stanky was already the Dodgers' second baseman and leadoff hitter.[citation

so that Robinson could return to his natural position and also bat leadoff.[citation 
needed] He appeared in three World Series in the five years between 1947 
and 1951 — with three different National League champions, the Dodgers, 
Braves and Giants, all of whom lost to their American League opponents. 
Following the 1951 World Series, in which he played in all six games for 
the Giants but hit an anemic .136, he was traded to the Cardinals as player-manager. 
In 1952, his Cardinals won seven more games than they had in 1951 and he 
was chosen Major League Manager of the Year by The Sporting News even though 
the Redbirds didn't move up in the standings, finishing in third place 
both years. But his time as Cardinal manager coincided with the slow decline 
of the team and its farm system from its glory days in the 1940s and the 
ownership transition from Fred Saigh to August "Gussie" Busch, and on May 
27, 1955, after a 17–19 start, he was fired. Stanky then managed the Triple-A 
Minneapolis Millers (1956) before returning to the Majors as a coach for 
the Cleveland Indians (1957–58). He then spent almost six seasons in the 
Cardinal front office in charge of player development (1959–64), moving 
on to the New York Mets in a similar capacity in 1965. In 1966, he succeeded 
Al López as the Chicago White Sox' manager. The White Sox had been runners-up 
in the American League for three successive seasons (1963–65), averaging 
almost 96 victories per year, but Stanky's maiden squad won only 83 games 
and fell to fourth place. However, his 1967 White Sox team — built on speed 
and pitching but hampered by an impotent offense — contended for the pennant 
until the last week of the season in a thrilling four-team race. But they 
lost their last five games to the lowly Kansas City Athletics and Washington 
Senators, and finished three games behind the surprise pennant winners, 
the "Impossible Dream" Boston Red Sox. In 1968, the White Sox got off to 
a terrible start, losing their first ten games (extending their regular-season 
losing streak to 15 games dating from 1967). They recovered slightly but 
were only 34–45 on July 11, when Stanky was fired and Lopez came out of 
retirement to reclaim his old job. After his firing in Chicago, Stanky 
became the head baseball coach of the University of South Alabama in 1969, 
compiling a 490–195-2 (.714) record with five NCAA Baseball Tournament 
appearances over 14 seasons. He returned to the professional arena briefly 
in 1977 as manager of the Texas Rangers, succeeding Frank Lucchesi in midseason. 
He won his first game on June 22, but had second thoughts about leaving 
his adopted state of Alabama and resigned after a mere 18 hours on the 
job (one of the shortest managerial stints in MLB history) and went back 
to college coaching at South Alabama. According to Leo Durocher's autobiography, 
Stanky quit because he couldn't adapt to the attitudes of modern baseball 
players. His career MLB managerial mark was 467–435 (.518). Stanky was 
inducted into the Mobile Sports Hall of Fame in 1990. He died in 1999 at 
age 82 in Fairhope, Alabama, leaving four children: Beverly, Kay, Mariann 
and Mike. He was buried in the Catholic Cemetery of Mobile,[4] alongside 
his father-in-law, Milt Stock, a Major League infielder and coach in the 
first half of the twentieth century.[5] Eddie Stanky Field, the ballpark
