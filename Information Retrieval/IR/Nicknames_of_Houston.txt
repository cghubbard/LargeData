There are many nicknames for the city of Houston, the largest city in Texas 
and third-largest city in the United States. The city's nicknames reflect 
its geography, economy, multicultural population, and popular culture, 
including sports and music. They are often used by the media and in popular 
culture to reference the city. Houston currently has one official nickname, 
"Space City", signifying the city's global importance to space exploration 
and historical role as a prominent center of activity by the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration (NASA). Cities adopt official nicknames such as 
this one to establish a civic identity, promote civic pride, and build 
community unity.[1] Houston has had other nicknames in the past which have 
faded in common usage, going as far back as the 1870s. The city has recently 
accumulated several unofficial nicknames from among sub-groups within the 
city, including several whose origins are in the local hip-hop subculture. 
The most recently added nickname is "The Big Heart", which refers to assistance 
given by Houston and its citizens to the victims of Hurricane Katrina in 
2005 and 2006. Houston received its official nickname of "Space City" in 
1967 because it is home to NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center.[2][3] NASA's 
center in Houston has its origins in the Space Task Group which directed 
its first manned spaceflight program, Project Mercury. In 1961, it grew 
into a bigger organization as the Manned Spacecraft Center, and in 1962 
moved into a newly built campus on land donated by Rice University.[4] 
It was renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) in honor of Texas 
U.S. Senator, Vice President, and President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973, 
the year Johnson died. As Senate Majority Leader, Johnson played a decisive 
role in passage of the legislation which created NASA in 1958. JSC contains 
the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center, which coordinates 
and monitors all human spaceflight for the United States, and directed 
all Space Shuttle missions and activities aboard the International Space 
Station.[5] The visitor's center of JSC is Space Center Houston.[6] The 
first words transmitted by Neil Armstrong from the moon, "Houston, Tranquility 
Base here. The Eagle has landed", are written in 15 languages on bronze 
plaques placed along the main entrance of Tranquility Park in downtown 
Houston. A replica of one of the footprints left on the moon by Neil Armstrong 
is also on display inside the park.[7] Houston is popularly known as "The 
Bayou City"[8] (and less frequently as "Baghdad on the Bayou")[9] because 
it is home to ten winding waterways that flow through the surrounding area. 
Buffalo Bayou is the main waterway flowing through the city and has a significant 
place in Texas history, not only due to the founding place of the City 
of Houston, but also because the final battle for Texas Independence was 
fought along its banks.[10] Other major bayous in the city include White 
Oak Bayou, Brays Bayou and Sims Bayou.[11] "H-Town" is a widely popular 
modern nickname for Houston.[12] It is commonly used in reference to the 
city both locally and internationally, especially within the entertainment 
community. In addition, the H-Town Blues Festival is a music festival held 
each year in the city,[13] and the H-Town Arena Theatre has hosted a variety 
of performing artists from around the country since the 1970s.[14] H-Town 
(with the "H" standing for Houston) is also the name of an R&B hip hop 
band from Houston that was formed in 1992.[15] The nickname of "Clutch 
City" was given to the city of Houston after the Houston Rockets won the 
1994 and 1995 NBA championships. The moniker was adopted in response to 
a front-page headline in the Houston Chronicle declaring Houston to be 
"Choke City".[16] It was revived in 2005, as the Houston Astros had a late-season 
rally to win the pennant and clinch their first-ever World Series appearance, 
and again in 2006, when the Houston Dynamo won the MLS Cup in their inaugural 
season.[17] The Rockets' mascot, "Clutch the Bear", was named the 5th-most 
recognizable mascot in sports by USA Today in February 2005, and was inducted 
into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2006.[18] Crush City is a nickname that 
derived from the 2015 Houston Astros season. "Crush" is a reference to 
the high amount of home runs delivered by the Houston Astros, as the team 
ended with the second most home runs in the MLB. "Magnolia City" is one 
of the earliest of Houston’s many nicknames. The Texas World, a newspaper 
first published in 1900, is said to have labeled Houston "the Magnolia 
City",[19] but the nickname had been in use among the locals since the 
1870s.[20] Areas of east Houston, particularly Harrisburg and Magnolia 
Park, were once natural Magnolia forests that were wiped out by urban sprawl 
by the 1920s. The nickname is still sometimes used in media stories about 
the city.[19] The nickname "Capital of the Sunbelt" (also "Golden Buckle 
on the Sun Belt")[21] appeared during the boomtown years when the city 
experienced rapid growth.[22][23][24][25][26] In the late 1970s, Houston 
was experiencing a population increase, as people from Rust Belt states 
moved en masse into Texas.[27] The new residents mostly came for the numerous 
employment opportunities in the petroleum industry, resulting from the 
Arab Oil Embargo.[28] The "Big Heart" is a nickname Houston earned in 2005–06 
among many of the storm victims from Louisiana and other affected areas 
who sought refuge there in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.[29] Angelo 
Edwards, vice chair of the ACORN Katrina Survivors Association, said, "No 
other city really provided the resources and assistance Houston has."[29] 
Houston housed, fed and mended more than 150,000 survivors in an effort 
that won acclaim throughout the United States, mounting what is believed 
to be the biggest shelter operation in the country's history, including 
Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH)-like mega-clinics that took on problems 
ranging from emergency care to eyeglass prescriptions.[29] "This has been 
a real success story", said Houston Mayor Bill White. "So many Houstonians 
stepped up to help our neighbors from Louisiana. It was humbling, and it 
showed the world the big heart and the incredible talent of our city."[30] 
"Screwston" is a popular modern nickname for the city of Houston.[31] Although 
it is not an official nickname, it is widely known by fans of local hip-hop 
artist DJ Screw and his style of music, known as "chopped and screwed".[32] 
The nickname "Hustle Town", which originated from "H-Town", which in turn 
is a contraction of Houston, is often heard in the Houston hip hop culture. 
H-town was reformed to "Hustle Town" by an unknown word evolution process.[33] 
The "City of Syrup" nickname (also "Syrup City") refers to the enjoyment 
of codeine-laced cough syrup, sometimes called purple drank, that has been 
popular in Houston and is associated with some rap artists.[34][35] Houston 
rap artist Big Moe used this nickname for the title of his 2000 album City 
of Syrup, whose cover featured an image of purple ooze being poured over 
the Houston skyline.[36] Houston is considered by many to be "The Energy 
Capital of the World"[37] (also "Oil Capital of the World"), because the 
city is home to more than 5,000 energy-related firms.[38] The city is a 
leading domestic and international center for virtually every segment of 
the oil and gas industry—exploration, production, transmission, marketing, 
service, supply, offshore drilling, and technology.[39][40] Houston dominates 
U.S. oil and gas exploration and production and is unrivaled in the American 
energy industry.[41] It is home to more than 3,600 energy-related establishments. 
Houston is also home to 13 of the nation’s 20 largest natural gas transmission 
companies, 600 exploration and production firms and more than 170 pipeline 
operators.[39][40] Houston also hosts the annual Offshore Technology Conference 
which is the world's largest energy-related trade show. See also: List
