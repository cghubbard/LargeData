As player As coach As manager Santos "Sandy" Alomar Velázquez Jr. (Spanish 
pronunciation: [aloˈmar], /ˈæləmɑːr/; born June 18, 1966) is a professional 
baseball catcher, coach, and manager. He played in Major League Baseball 
catcher for the San Diego Padres, Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox, 
Colorado Rockies, Texas Rangers, Los Angeles Dodgers, and New York Mets 
between 1988 and 2007.[1] Alomar is a six-time All-Star. He is the son 
of former major leaguer Sandy Alomar Sr. and the brother of Hall of Fame 
second baseman Roberto Alomar.[1] Alomar was a highly regarded catcher 
in the San Diego organization after being named Baseball America Minor 
League Player of the Year in both 1988 and 1989, but he was blocked behind 
Benito Santiago at the Major League level. After two short call-ups with 
the Padres, he finally got his chance at an everyday job after being traded 
to Cleveland after the 1989 season along with Carlos Baerga and Chris James, 
in exchange for power-hitter Joe Carter. Once in Cleveland, he established 
himself immediately, becoming the first rookie catcher to start an All-Star 
game and winning both Rookie of the Year honors and a Gold Glove Award.[2] 
Alomar was selected as an All-Star in 1991 and 1992. However, his 1992 
season was largely lost due to injuries, and he finished the year with 
zero home runs and only seven RBIs in 199 at-bats. Over the next few years, 
Alomar suffered several injuries and failed to realize his potential. He 
came back strong in the first half of 1996 to make his fourth All-Star 
team, but then faded in the second half. In 1997, everything finally came 
together for Alomar. He batted .324, was the MVP of the All-Star game in 
his home ballpark (hitting a game-deciding two-run home run off Shawn Estes 
to the left field bleachers in the bottom of the seventh inning of a 3–1 
American League win; he was the first player to hit an All-Star game home 
run in his home stadium since Hank Aaron in 1972), put together a 30-game 
hitting streak (one short of Nap Lajoie's Indians record and four short 
of his former teammate Benito Santiago's record for catchers), and helped 
lead Cleveland to their third straight postseason appearance. In the Division 
Series against the New York Yankees, Alomar hit .316 with two home runs, 
including a game-tying shot off Mariano Rivera in the eighth inning of 
Game 4. Though he was less effective against the Baltimore Orioles in the 
ALCS, he still provided a game-winning hit in the ninth inning of Game 
4. The Indians lost the World Series to the Florida Marlins, but not on 
account of Alomar, who hit .367 with two home runs. Although Alomar was 
selected to his sixth All-Star team in 1998, he turned in a mediocre season 
overall and then had injury problems again in 1999. He left the Indians 
as a free agent after the 2000 season and played in a limited role with 
the Chicago White Sox, Colorado Rockies, Texas Rangers, Los Angeles Dodgers, 
and New York Mets. On August 1, 2009, the Indians inducted Alomar to the 
organization's Hall of Fame. On February 15, 2008, Alomar was named the 
catching instructor for the New York Mets organization. He spent the 2008 
and 2009 seasons in that role.[3] Alomar was hired in November 2009 as 
the first base coach to manager Manny Acta's staff of the Cleveland Indians. 
During the 2010 off-season Alomar was rumored to be one of four finalists, 
along with Brian Butterfield, DeMarlo Hale, and John Farrell, for the Toronto 
Blue Jays managerial job.[4] During the end of the 2011 season, Alomar 
was rumored to be on the shortlist of candidates for the vacant Chicago 
Cubs and Boston Red Sox managerial positions.[5] On September 28, 2011, 
Alomar was promoted by the Indians to the position of bench coach for the 
2012 season. On September 27, 2012, the Indians promoted him to interim 
manager after firing Acta.[6] He finished his interim reign with a record 
of three wins and three losses.[7] On October 6, 2012 the Indians announced 
that the club had hired Terry Francona to take over as manager.[8] On October 
31, 2012 the Cleveland Indians announced that Alomar would be back as the 
bench coach for the 2013 season under Francona. Alomar was replaced by
