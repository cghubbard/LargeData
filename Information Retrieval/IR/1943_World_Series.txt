The 1943 World Series matched the defending champion St. Louis Cardinals 
against the New York Yankees, in a rematch of the 1942 Series. The Yankees 
won the Series in five games for their tenth championship in 21 seasons. 
It was Yankees manager Joe McCarthy's final Series win. This series was 
also the first to have an accompanying World Series highlight film (initially, 
the films were created as gifts to troops fighting in World War II, to 
give them a brief recap of baseball action back home), a tradition that 
continues to this day. This World Series was scheduled for a 3–4 format 
because of wartime travel restrictions. The 3–4 format meant there was 
only one trip between ballparks, but if the Series had ended in a four-game 
sweep, there would have been three games played in one park and only one 
in the other. Because of World War II, both teams' rosters were depleted. 
Johnny Beazley, Jimmy Brown, Creepy Crespi, Terry Moore and Enos Slaughter 
were no longer on the Cardinals' roster. Joe DiMaggio, Phil Rizzuto, Red 
Ruffing and Buddy Hassett were missing from the Yankees, and Red Rolfe 
had retired to coach at Dartmouth College. Cardinals pitchers Howie Pollet, 
Max Lanier and Mort Cooper ranked 1–2–3 in the National League in ERA in 
1943 at 1.75, 1.90 and 2.30, respectively. AL New York Yankees (4) vs.

as the death of Mort and Walker Cooper's father, Robert. Murry Dickson, 
who helped close the door on the Cardinals by allowing no hits while on 
the mound, was on a ten-day pass from the United States Army. 1943 World
