Wesley Cheek "Wes" Ferrell (February 2, 1908 – December 9, 1976) was an 
American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball 
from 1927 through 1941. Primarily a starting pitcher, Ferrell played for 
the Cleveland Indians (1927–33), Boston Red Sox (1934–37), Washington Senators 
(1937–38), New York Yankees (1938–39), Brooklyn Dodgers (1940) and Boston 
Braves (1941). He batted and threw right-handed. Ferrell's 37 home runs 
as a batter remain a career record for a MLB pitcher. Wesley Cheek Ferrell 
was born on February 2, 1908 in Greensboro, North Carolina to Rufus Benjamin 
"Lonnie" and Alice Clara Carpenter.[1] His father was employed by the Southern 
Railroad,[2] and the family lived on a 160-acre dairy farm that was also 
used to grow crops such as hay and tobacco.[2] Wes was the fifth of seven 
children, all boys.[3] They each played baseball for the local high school 
team, and two others went on to enjoyed long careers in baseball; Rick, 
a Hall of Fame catcher, and George was an 18-year minor league veteran.[2][4] 
Wesley starred in baseball and basketball while playing for Guilford High 
School, and later for the Oak Ridge Military Academy in 1926.[2] He was 
soon noticed by Bill Rapp, a scout for the Cleveland Indians, and in 1927 
they, as well as the Detroit Tigers, offered him a contract while he was 
playing for a semi-professional team in East Douglas, Massachusetts. He 
chose the Indians, and joined the team for the remainder of the 1927 season. 
He made his Major League Baseball debut on September 9, 1927, pitching 
a single inning against the Boston Red Sox, and gave up three earned runs.[5][6] 
Although, he initially made the Indians' roster in 1928, he was soon demoted 
to the Terre Haute Tots, of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. He pitched 
well for the Tots, winning 20 games against eight losses, and had a 2.74 
earned run average. In September, he was re-called to majors, and pitched 
two games before the season ended. He started both games, completed one 
of them, and while he pitched well, he received the loss in both.[7] In 
1929, he joined the Indians for good, though only a spot-starter as first, 
he established himself as one of the best pitchers in the American League 
(AL) by season's end. He was noted to have had an excellent fastball, which 
he complimented with a good curveball and a deceptive changeup.[2] He posted 
a 21–10 win–record, with 100 strikeouts and a 3.60 earned run average (ERA).[5] 
His 21 victories placed second in the league behind George Earnshaw's 24, 
and he finished in the top ten in strikeouts, earned run average, and saves.[8] 
In 1930, he began the season as the Indian's number two starting pitcher 
behind Willis Hudlin, who made the team's opening day start.[9] He quickly 
established himself as the team's ace by significantly improving his pitching 
performance. He increased his win total to 25, which finished second in 
the league, this time behind Lefty Grove's 28, and lowered his ERA to 3.31.[10] 
His batting skills improved in 1930; his batting average jumped from .237 
in 1929 to .297 in 1930.[5] Ferrell continued his excellence during the 
1931 season, although his ERA increased to 3.75, he led the lead in complete 
games with 27, and collected another 22 wins.[5] On April 29, he pitched 
a 9-0 no-hitter against the St. Louis Browns, striking out eight, while 
also hitting a home run, a double, and had four runs batted in (RBIs). 
His brother Rick, was the Browns' catcher.[11] On May 8, he experienced 
pain in his right shoulder while warming up for a start against the Red 
Sox, and for the rest of the season, his fastball became largely ineffective, 
having to rely upon his other pitches.[2] As stellar as his pitching statistics 
were, it was his hitting skills that were dramatically improving each season. 
Through 1930, he had hit just one home run, but in 1931 he hit nine, breaking 
the previous home run record for pitchers of seven by Jack Stivetts in 
1890.[12] On August 31 he hit two home runs against the Chicago White Sox 
in 13–5 victory at Comiskey Park, the first of five times he would achieve 
the feat.[12] Ferrell was an honest and outspoken individual, and his attitude 
began to sour during this period of his career. It was suspected that he 
had anxiety in regard to his shoulder injury, which caused him to angrily 
react to perceived bad calls by umpires, and teammates who made errors 
that negatively affected the game. On one occasion, Ferrell refused to 
be pulled from a game by his manager, and was suspended ten days without 
pay for insubordination.[2] Because of his volatile temperament he was 
fined and suspended several times for refusing to leave a game, or for 
leaving it without permission.[2] After being driven from the mound in 
one game, he punched himself in the face and began to slam his head into 
the wall. He had to be restrained by his team to stop him from continuing 
to hurt himself.[2] Despite the pain in his shoulder, and worsening behavioral 
issues, he continued to be a durable and effective pitcher. In 1932, Ferrell 
posted his fourth consecutive 20-win season, with a record of 23-13, struck 
out 105, and had a 3.66 ERA.[5] The 1933 season began well for Ferrell, 
he had a 5-4 win-loss record and a 2.12 ERA on June 1,[13] and was named 
to the inaugural Major League Baseball All-Star Game representing the American 
League.[14] He was not called upon to play in the game, but his brother 
Rick was also selected to the team, and played the entire game.[14] As 
the season progressed, however, his performance began to diminish. From 
July until the end of the season, he was largely inneffective as a pitcher, 
and his availability became infrequent.[13] In response, his manager, Roger 
Peckinpaugh, tried playing him in left field. The experiment was deemed 
a failure due to Ferrell's lack of fielding skills.[2] He had another great 
year as a batter, however, hitting seven home runs, and he compiled 26 
RBIs and a .271 batting average.[5] After a disappointing 11-12 record 
for the year, the Indians offered him what Ferrell regarded as an unacceptable 
contract offer, and he refused to sign. He also refused to join the team 
unless his contract demands were met.[2] On May 25, 1934, the Indians traded 
him, along with Dick Porter, to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Bob 
Weiland, Bob Seeds and $25,000 cash.[5] By joining the Red Sox, Ferrell 
united with his brother Rick, who was their starting catcher.[15] He made 
his debut for Boston on May 30 in relief, as were his next two appearances. 
He entered the starting rotation on June 10.[16] On August 12, in front 
of a record crowd of 46,766 fans (with about 20,000 turned away), Babe 
Ruth made his farewell appearance as a New York Yankee in Boston. He singled 
and doubled against Ferrell, but Boston prevailed against Ruth and the 
New York Yankees by a score of 6 runs to 4.[17] From that point until the 
end of the season, he was consistently effective, lowering his ERA from 
4.64 on July 25, to a season-ending 3.63.[16] He completed the 1934 season 
with a 14-5 record, and twice hit two home runs in a game.[5] The first 
occurred against the St. Louis Browns on July 13, and the other on August 
22 against the Chicago White Sox when he hit a game-tying home run in the 
eighth inning, then hit the game-winning, walk-off home run in tenth inning.[12] 
Never known as a control pitcher, Ferrell's base on balls totals were usually 
high, including leading the league with 130 in 1931, but in 1934, his bases 
on balls per 9 innings pitched was the best in AL.[18] In 1935, Ferrell 
continued the success he had in the latter part of 1934, and arguably had 
his greatest season. He compiled league-leading totals with victories with 
25, as well as innings pitched, games started, and games completed. He 
also finished within the leaders in shutouts, bases on balls per nine innings, 
and strikeouts.[19] As a batter, he had a .347 batting average, and hit 
seven home runs, the third, and last, time he reached this plateau.[5] 
On July 21, with the Red Sox trailing the Detroit Tigers 4–6 in the bottom 
of the ninth inning and two runners on the bases. Ferrell was sent in as 
a pinch hitter and hit a three-run walk-off home run, defeating the Tigers 
by the score of 7–6.[12] The following day, Ferrell once again hit a walk-off 
home run, this time in a tied-game against the St. Louis Browns.[12] His 
achievements during the 1935 season resulted in his second-place finish 
in the Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting, finishing behind Hank Greenberg.[20] 
Ferrell had another effective season in 1936, with a 20-15 record, while 
leading the league in games started, complete games, and inning pitched.[5] 
His best games that season were two-hit shoutouts; one occurred on May 
3 against the Tigers, and the other on June 21 against the Browns.[21] 
This was his sixth and last time he achieved the 20-win mark during his 
major league career. His 1937 season began slow and he was unable to turn 
it around, by June 11, he had just three victories against six losses, 
and his ERA was a lofty 7.61.[22] On June 11, the Ferrell brothers and 
Mel Almada were traded to the Washington Senators in exchange for Ben Chapman 
and Bobo Newsom.[5] Shortly after being traded to Washington, Wes won four 
of his first five starts, and was named to his second All-Star team.[23] 
Joining him on the team was his brother Rick,[24] and the game was played 
on July 7, neither of the Ferrell's played.[25] Although he had lackluster 
pitching record of 14-19, he led the AL in innings and complete games for 
the third consecutive season.[5] Ferrell remained with Washington in 1938, 
and leading the team with 13 victories, but due to his behavior and personality 
conflict with owner Clark Griffith, he was released from the team on August 
12.[2] Ferrell was quickly signed by the Yankees, and appeared in five 
games before the season ended. Over the following winter, he underwent 
arm surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow,[2] but was unable to fully 
recover. He was released by the Yankees in May 1939, and went unsigned 
until January 1940, when he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers. He made just one 
relief appearance for the Dodgers before being released in May. He signed 
with the Boston Braves in February 1941, but was released after four games.[5] 
Ferrell finished his major-league career with a win-loss record of 193-128, 
4.04 ERA, and 985 strikeouts in 2623 innings pitched. In 374 games pitched, 
he started 323, completed 227, and tossed 17 shutouts. In addition to his 
talents as a pitcher, he was also one of the best-hitting pitchers in major 
league history, setting records for pitchers; his nine home runs in 1931, 
and his career-total of 37 still stand. In total, he collected 329 hits, 
57 doubles, 12 triples, delivered 208 RBIs, scored 175 runs, a .446 slugging 
percentage, and a .280 batting average.[5] Even after the end of his major 
league career, Ferrell continued to play minor league ball. During these 
later years, he mainly played the outfield. After his release by the Braves 
in May 1941, he signed with the Leaksville-Draper-Spray Triplets of the 
class-D Bi-State League, where he batted .332 with 20 home runs in just 
74 games. The following season, he joined the class-C Lynchburg Senators 
of the Virginia League, where he hit .361 with 31 homers in 123 games. 
He continued to play sporadically in the minors for several years before 
finally retiring for good after the 1949 season. Wes Ferrell died at the 
age of 68 on December 9, 1976 in Sarasota, Florida, and is interred at 
New Garden Cemetery in Greensboro, North Carolina.[5] Arguments in favor 
of inducting Ferrell into the Baseball Hall of Fame include the factors 
which affected his numbers and lack of post-season success. In addition 
to the era in which he played, he didn't play for many good teams, and 
he pitched in hitter-friendly parks.[26] In his book, The Bill James Historical 
Baseball Abstract, Bill James, noted that Ferrell's high career ERA of 
4.04 is not surprising due the heavy-hitting era in which he played. The 
average AL ERA during his playing time was lofty 4.54. However, when you 
adjust his ERA with what he produced as a hitter, he was effectively 22% 
better than the league average. In this regard, he is comparable to other 
high-ERA pitchers that helped themselves by being a good batter such as 
Ted Lyons, a Hall of Fame member, and Carl Mays.[27] Although he, unlike 
his brother, has not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, in 1981, 
Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest 
Baseball Players of All Time, in celebration of his being not just a star 
pitcher but the best-hitting pitcher of all time—noting that Babe Ruth 
did most of his hitting when he was no longer a regular pitcher. In February 
2008, Ferrell was inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame. He is the 
only pitcher since 1900 to win 20 games in his first four full major league 
seasons. He retired with the seventh highest winning percentage (.601) 
among pitchers with at least 300 AL decisions (for teams that never won 
the pennant) and also with the fourth highest fielding percentage (.975) 
in AL history. "I didn't see any big deal in being a good hitter as well 
as a good pitcher", said Ferrell, a two-time minor league batting champion 
as an outfielder after his major league days were over. When he went on 
to be a manager, Ferrell was slapped with suspensions for belting an umpire, 
and for removing his team from the field. He was a fiery competitor and 
a brilliant player with natural talent, whose achievements may have been
