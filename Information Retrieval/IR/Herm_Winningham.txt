Herman Son Winningham (born December 1, 1961 in Orangeburg, South Carolina) 
is a former professional baseball player. He played all or part of nine 
seasons in Major League Baseball, primarily as a center fielder, for the 
New York Mets, Montreal Expos, Cincinnati Reds and Boston Red Sox. Drafted 
by the New York Mets in the 1st round of the 1981 amateur draft, Winningham 
made his major league debut with the Mets on September 1, 1984. At one 
time a highly regarded prospect in the New York Mets chain, he was a part 
of the Gary Carter trade, along with Hubie Brooks, Floyd Youmans and Mike 
Fitzgerald. His talents never caught up to his statistics as he was primarily 
a reserve outfielder for most of his career. His final game was with the 
Boston Red Sox on October 3, 1992. Winningham was a member of the Cincinnati 
Reds team that defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1990 National League 
Championship Series and the Oakland Athletics in the 1990 World Series. 
In the last game of the World Series he replaced an injured Billy Hatcher, 
went 2-3 and scored the winning run. During the 1990 postseason, he batted 
.364. Winningham is currently the head coach of the Orangeburg-Wilkinson 
High School baseball team in his hometown of Orangeburg.[citation needed]
