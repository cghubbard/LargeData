The Midwestern United States, also referred to as the American Midwest 
or simply the Midwest, is one of the four geographic regions defined by 
the United States Census Bureau, occupying the northern central part of 
the United States of America.[2] It was officially named the North Central 
region by the Census Bureau until 1984.[3] Although the region is traditionally 
defined in a number of ways, the Census Bureau's definition consists of 
12 states in the north central United States: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, 
Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South 
Dakota, and Wisconsin. Illinois is the most populous of the states and 
North Dakota the least. A 2012 report from the United States Census put 
the population of the Midwest at 65,377,684. The Midwest is divided by 
the Census Bureau into two divisions. The East North Central Division includes 
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, all of which are also 
part of the Great Lakes region. The West North Central Division includes 
Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Nebraska, and South Dakota, 
all of which, except for Iowa, Missouri and Minnesota, are located, at 
least partly, within the Great Plains region of the country. Major rivers 
in the region include, from east to west, the Ohio River, the Upper Mississippi 
River, and the Missouri River, constituting the main branches of the northern 
Mississippi River watershed.[citation needed] Chicago is the most populated 
city in the American Midwest and the third most populous in the entire 
country. Other large Midwest cities include (in order by population): Indianapolis, 
Columbus, Detroit, Milwaukee, Kansas City, Omaha, Minneapolis, Cleveland, 
Wichita and St. Louis. Chicago and its suburbs form the largest metropolitan 
statistical area with 9.8 million people, followed by Metro Detroit, Minneapolis–St. 
Paul, Greater St. Louis, Greater Cleveland, Greater Cincinnati (without 
the Kentucky portion), Kansas City metro area, and the Columbus metro area.[4] 
The term Midwestern has been in use since the 1880s to refer to portions 
of the central United States.[5] A variant term, Middle West, has been 
used since the 19th century and remains relatively common.[6][7] Another 
term sometimes applied to the same general region is the heartland.[8] 
Other designations for the region have fallen out of use, such as the Northwest 
or Old Northwest (from "Northwest Territory") and Mid-America. The Northwest 
Territory (1787) was one of the earliest territories of the United States, 
stretching northwest from the Ohio River to northern Minnesota and upper-Mississippi. 
The upper-Mississippi watershed including the Missouri and Illinois Rivers 
was the setting for the earlier French settlements of the Illinois Country.[citation 
needed] Economically the region is balanced between heavy industry and 
agriculture (large sections of this land area make up the United States' 
Corn Belt), with finance and services such as medicine and education becoming 
increasingly important. Its central location makes it a transportation 
crossroads for river boats, railroads, autos, trucks and airplanes. Politically 
the region swings back and forth between the parties, and thus is heavily 
contested and often decisive in elections.[9][10] After the sociological 
study Middletown (1929), which was based on Muncie, Indiana,[11] commentators 
used Midwestern cities (and the Midwest generally) as "typical" of the 
nation. The region has a higher employment-to-population ratio (the percentage 
of employed people at least 16 years-old) than the Northeast, the West, 
the South, or the Sun Belt states as of 2011[update].[12] Traditional definitions 
of the Midwest include the Northwest Ordinance Old Northwest states and 
many states that were part of the Louisiana Purchase. The states of the 
Old Northwest are also known as Great Lakes states and are east-north central 
in the United States. The Ohio River runs along the southeastern section 
while the Mississippi River runs north to south near the center. Many of 
the Louisiana Purchase states in the west-north central United States, 
are also known as Great Plains states, where the Missouri River is a major 
waterway joining with the Mississippi. The Midwest lies north of the 36°30′ 
parallel that the 1820 Missouri Compromise established as the dividing 
line between future slave and non-slave states.[citation needed] The Midwest 
Region is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as these 12 states:[2] The 
Midwest Region of the National Park Service consists of these twelve states 
plus the state of Arkansas.[citation needed] The Council of State Governments, 
an organization for communication and coordination among state governments, 
includes in its Midwest regional office 11 states from the above list, 
omitting Missouri, which is in the CSG South region.[13] The vast central 
area of the U.S., into Canada, is a landscape of low, flat to rolling terrain 
in the Interior Plains. Most of its eastern two-thirds form the Interior 
Lowlands. The Lowlands gradually rise westward, from a line passing through 
eastern Kansas, up to over 5,000 feet (1,500 m) in the unit known as the 
Great Plains. Most of the Great Plains area is now farmed.[14] While these 
states are for the most part relatively flat, consisting either of plains 
or of rolling and small hills, there is a measure of geographical variation. 
In particular, the following areas exhibit a high degree of topographical 
variety: the eastern Midwest near the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains; 
the Great Lakes Basin; the Ozark Mountains of southern Missouri; the rugged 
topography of Southern Indiana and far Southern Illinois; and the Driftless 
Area of northwestern Illinois, southwestern Wisconsin, southeastern Minnesota, 
and northeastern Iowa.[citation needed] Proceeding westward, the Appalachian 
Plateau topography gradually gives way to gently rolling hills and then 
(in central Ohio) to flat lands converted principally to farms and urban 
areas. This is the beginning of the vast Interior Plains of North America. 
As a result, prairies cover most of the Great Plains states. Iowa and much 
of Illinois lie within an area called the prairie peninsula, an eastward 
extension of prairies that borders conifer and mixed forests to the north, 
and hardwood deciduous forests to the east and south.[citation needed] 
Geographers subdivide the Interior Plains into the Interior Lowlands and 
the Great Plains on the basis of elevation. The Lowlands are mostly below 
1,500 feet (460 m) above sea level whereas the Great Plains to the west 
are higher, rising in Colorado to around 5,000 feet (1,500 m). The Lowlands, 
then, are confined to parts of Minnesota, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, 
Tennessee, and Kentucky. Missouri and Arkansas have regions of Lowlands 
elevations, but in the Ozarks (within the Interior Highlands) are higher. 
Those familiar with the topography of eastern Ohio may be confused by this; 
that region is hilly, but its rocks are horizontal and are an extension 
of the Appalachian Plateau.[citation needed] The Interior Plains are largely 
coincident with the vast Mississippi River Drainage System (other major 
components are the Missouri and Ohio Rivers). These rivers have for tens 
of millions of years been eroding downward into the mostly horizontal sedimentary 
rocks of Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic ages. The modern Mississippi 
River system has developed during the Pleistocene Epoch of the Cenozoic.[citation 
needed] Rainfall decreases from east to west, resulting in different types 
of prairies, with the tallgrass prairie in the wetter eastern region, mixed-grass 
prairie in the central Great Plains, and shortgrass prairie towards the 
rain shadow of the Rockies. Today, these three prairie types largely correspond 
to the corn/soybean area, the wheat belt, and the western rangelands, respectively.[citation 
needed] Although hardwood forests in the northern Midwest were clear-cut 
in the late 19th century, they were replaced by new growth. Ohio and Michigan's 
forests are still growing. The majority of the Midwest can now be categorized 
as urbanized areas or pastoral agricultural areas.[citation needed] Among 
the American Indians Paleoindian cultures were the earliest in North America, 
with a presence in the Great Plains and Great Lakes areas from about 12,000 
BCE to around 8,000 BCE.[citation needed] Following the Paleo-Indian period 
is the Archaic period (8,000 BCE to 1,000 BCE), the Woodland Tradition 
(1,000 BCE to 100 CE), and the Mississippian Period (900 to 1500 CE). Archaeological 
evidence indicates that Mississippian culture traits probably began in 
the St. Louis, Missouri area and spread northwest along the Mississippi 
and Illinois rivers and entered the state along the Kankakee River system. 
It also spread northward into Indiana along the Wabash, Tippecanoe, and 
White Rivers.[15] Mississippian peoples in the Midwest were mostly farmers 
who followed the rich, flat floodplains of Midwestern rivers. They brought 
with them a well-developed agricultural complex based on three major crops—maize, 
beans, and squash. Maize, or corn, was the primary crop of Mississippian 
farmers. They gathered a wide variety of seeds, nuts, and berries, and 
fished and hunted for fowl to supplement their diets. With such an intensive 
form of agriculture, this culture supported large populations.[citation 
needed] The Mississippi period was characterized by a mound-building culture. 
The Mississippians suffered a tremendous population decline about 1400, 
coinciding with the global climate change of the Little Ice Age. Their 
culture effectively ended before 1492.[16] The major tribes of the Great 
Lakes region included the Hurons, Ottawa, Chippewas or Ojibwas, Potawatomis, 
Winnebago (Ho-chunk), Menominees, Sacs, Neutrals, Fox, and the Miami. Most 
numerous were the Hurons and Chippewas. Fighting and battle were often 
launched between tribes, with the losers forced to flee.[17] Most are of 
the Algonquian language family. Some tribes—such as the Stockbridge-Munsee 
and the Brothertown—are also Algonkian-speaking tribes who relocated from 
the eastern seaboard to the Great Lakes region in the 19th century. The 
Oneida belong to the Iroquois language group and the Ho-Chunk of Wisconsin 
are one of the few Great Lakes tribes to speak a Siouan language.[18] American 
Indians in this area did not develop a written form of language.[citation 
needed] In the 16th century, American Indians used projectiles and tools 
of stone, bone, and wood to hunt and farm. They made canoes for fishing. 
Most of them lived in oval or conical wigwams that could be easily moved 
away. Various tribes had different ways of living. The Ojibwas were primarily 
hunters and fishing was also important in the Ojibwas economy. Other tribes 
such as Sac, Fox, and Miami, both hunted and farmed.[citation needed] They 
were oriented toward the open prairies where they engaged in communal hunts 
for buffalo (bison). In the northern forests, the Ottawas and Potawatomis 
separated into small family groups for hunting. The Winnebagos and Menominees 
used both hunting methods interchangeably and built up widespread trade 
networks extending as far west as the Rockies, north to the Great Lakes, 
south to the Gulf of Mexico, and east to the Atlantic Ocean.[citation needed] 
The Hurons reckoned descent through the female line, while the others favored 
the patrilineal method. All tribes were governed under chiefdoms or complex 
chiefdoms. For example, Hurons were divided into matrilineal clans, each 
represented by a chief in the town council, where they met with a town 
chief on civic matters. But Chippewa people's social and political life 
was simpler than that of settled tribes.[citation needed] The religious 
beliefs varied among tribes. Hurons believed in Yoscaha, a supernatural 
being who lived in the sky and was believed to have created the world and 
the Huron people. At death, Hurons thought the soul left the body to live 
in a village in the sky. Chippewas were a deeply religious people who believed 
in the Great Spirit. They worshiped the Great Spirit through all their 
seasonal activities and viewed religion as a private matter: each person's 
relation with his personal guardian spirit was part of his thinking every 
day of life. Ottawa and Potawatomi people had very similar religious beliefs 
to those of the Chippewas.[15] The Plains Indians are the indigenous peoples 
who live on the plains and rolling hills of the Great Plains of North America. 
Their colorful equestrian culture and famous conflicts with settlers and 
the US Army have made the Plains Indians archetypical in literature and 
art for American Indians everywhere.[citation needed] Plains Indians are 
usually divided into two broad classifications, with some degree of overlap. 
The first group were fully nomadic, following the vast herds of buffalo. 
Some tribes occasionally engaged in agriculture; growing tobacco and corn 
primarily. These included the Blackfoot, Arapaho, Assiniboine, Cheyenne, 
Comanche, Crow, Gros Ventre, Kiowa, Lakota, Lipan, Plains Apache (or Kiowa 
Apache), Plains Cree, Plains Ojibwe, Sarsi, Shoshone, Stoney, and Tonkawa.[citation 
needed] The second group of Plains Indians (sometimes referred to as Prairie 
Indians) were the semi-sedentary tribes who, in addition to hunting buffalo, 
lived in villages and raised crops. These included the Arikara, Hidatsa, 
Iowa, Kaw (or Kansa), Kitsai, Mandan, Missouria, Nez Perce, Omaha, Osage, 
Otoe, Pawnee, Ponca, Quapaw, Santee, Wichita, and Yankton.[citation needed] 
The nomadic tribes of the Great Plains survived on hunting, some of their 
major hunts centered on deer and buffalo. Some tribes are described as 
part of the 'Buffalo Culture' (sometimes called, for the American Bison). 
Although the Plains Indians hunted other animals, such as elk or antelope, 
bison was their primary game food source. Bison flesh, hide, and bones 
from Bison hunting provided the chief source of raw materials for items 
that Plains Indians made, including food, cups, decorations, crafting tools, 
knives, and clothing.[citation needed] The tribes followed the bison's 
seasonal grazing and migration. The Plains Indians lived in teepees because 
they were easily disassembled and allowed the nomadic life of following 
game. When Spanish horses were obtained, the Plains tribes rapidly integrated 
them into their daily lives. By the early 18th century, many tribes had 
fully adopted a horse culture. Before their adoption of guns, the Plains 
Indians hunted with spears, bows, and bows and arrows, and various forms 
of clubs. The use of horses by the Plains Indians made hunting (and warfare) 
much easier.[19] Among the most powerful and dominant tribes were the Dakota 
or Sioux, who occupied large amounts of territory in the Great Plains of 
the Midwest. The area of the Great Sioux Nation spread throughout the South 
and Midwest, up into the areas of Minnesota and stretching out west into 
the Rocky Mountains. At the same time, they occupied the heart of prime 
buffalo range, and also an excellent region for furs they could sell to 
French and American traders for goods such as guns. The Sioux (Dakota) 
became the most powerful of the Plains tribes and the greatest threat to 
American expansion.[20][21] The Sioux comprise three major divisions based 
on Siouan dialect and subculture:[citation needed] Today, the Sioux maintain 
many separate tribal governments scattered across several reservations, 
communities, and reserves in the Dakotas, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Montana 
in the United States, as well as Manitoba and southern Saskatchewan in 
Canada.[citation needed] European settlement of the area began in the 17th 
century following French exploration of the region and became known as 
New France. The French period began with the exploration of the Saint Lawrence 
River by Jacques Cartier in 1534 and ending with their expulsion by the 
British, who split New France with Spain in 1763.[23] In 1673, the governor 
of New France sent Jacques Marquette, a Catholic priest and missionary, 
and Louis Jolliet, a fur trader to map the way to the Northwest Passage 
to the Pacific. They traveled through Michigan's upper peninsula to the 
northern tip of Lake Michigan. On canoes, they crossed the massive lake 
and landed at present-day Green Bay, Wisconsin. They entered the Mississippi 
River on June 17, 1673.[24] Marquette and Jolliet soon realized that the 
Mississippi could not possibly be the Northwest Passage because it flowed 
south. Nevertheless, the journey continued. They recorded much of the wildlife 
they encountered. They turned around at the junction of the Mississippi 
River and Arkansas River and headed back.[citation needed] Marquette and 
Jolliet were the first to map the northern portion of the Mississippi River. 
They confirmed that it was easy to travel from the St. Lawrence River through 
the Great Lakes all the way to the Gulf of Mexico by water, that the native 
peoples who lived along the route were generally friendly, and that the 
natural resources of the lands in between were extraordinary. New France 
officials led by LaSalle followed up and erected a 4,000-mile network of 
fur trading posts.[25] At the end of the American Revolution, there were 
few, if any, American settlers in the Midwest. However, the U.S. gained 
possession of the entire Midwest east of the Mississippi, and pioneers 
headed to Ohio, where large tracts had been awarded to war veterans.[citation 
needed] While French control ended in 1763 after their defeat by Britain 
and Spain, most of the several hundred French settlers in small villages 
along the Mississippi River and its tributaries remained and were not disturbed 
by the new British government. By the terms of the Treaty of Paris, Spain 
was given Louisiana; the area west of the Mississippi. St. Louis and Ste. 
Genevieve in Missouri were the main towns, but there was little new settlement. 
France regained Louisiana from Spain in exchange for Tuscany by the terms 
of the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800. Napoleon had lost interest in reestablishing 
a French colonial empire in North America following the Haitian Revolution 
and together with the fact that France could not effectively defend Louisiana 
from Great Britain, he sold the territory to the United States in the Louisiana 
Purchase of 1803. Meanwhile, the British maintained forts and trading posts 
in U.S. territory, not giving them up until the mid-1790s by the Jay Treaty.[citation 
needed] American settlement began either via routes over the Appalachian 
Mountains or through the waterways of the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) 
at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving 
into the Midwest. Marietta, Ohio in 1787 became the first settlement in 
Ohio, but not until the defeat of Indian tribes at the Battle of Fallen 
Timbers in 1794 was large-scale settlement possible. Large numbers also 
came north from Kentucky into southern Ohio, Indiana and Illinois.[26] 
The region's fertile soil produced corn and vegetables; most farmers were 
self-sufficient. They cut trees and claimed the land, then sold it to newcomers 
and then moved further west to repeat the process.[citation needed] In 
1803, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the Lewis and Clark expedition 
that took place between May 1804 and September 1806. The goal was to explore 
the Louisiana Purchase, and establish trade and U.S. sovereignty over the 
native peoples along the Missouri River. The Lewis and Clark Expedition 
established relations with more than two dozen indigenous nations west 
of the Missouri River.[27] The Expedition returned east to St. Louis in 
the spring of 1806. In 1791, General Arthur St. Clair became commander 
of the United States Army and led a punitive expedition with two Regular 
Army regiments and some militia. Near modern-day Fort Recovery, his force 
advanced to the location of Indian settlements near the headwaters of the 
Wabash River, but on November 4 they were routed in battle by a tribal 
confederation led by Miami Chief Little Turtle and Shawnee chief Blue Jacket. 
More than 600 soldiers and scores of women and children were killed in 
the battle, which has since borne the name "St. Clair's Defeat." It remains 
the greatest defeat of a U.S. Army by Native Americans.[28][29][30] The 
British had a long-standing goal of building a "neutral", but pro-British 
Indian buffer state in the American Midwest.[31][32] They demanded a neutral 
Indian state at the peace conference that ended the War of 1812, but failed 
to gain any of it because they had lost control of the region in the Battle 
of Lake Erie and the Battle of the Thames in 1813, where Tecumseh was killed. 
The British then abandoned the Indians south of the lakes. The Indians 
were major losers in the War of 1812. Apart from the short Black Hawk War 
of 1832, the days of Indian warfare east of the Mississippi River had ended.[citation 
needed] Yankee settlers from New England started arriving in Ohio before 
1800, and spread throughout the northern half of the Midwest. Most of them 
started as farmers, but later the larger proportion moved to towns and 
cities as entrepreneurs, businessmen, and urban professionals. Since its 
beginnings in the 1830s, Chicago has grown to dominate the Midwestern metropolis 
landscape for over a century.[33] Historian John Bunker has examined the 
worldview of the Yankee settlers in the Midwest: Midwestern politics pitted 
Yankees against the German Catholics and Lutherans, who were often led 
by the Irish Catholics. These large groups, Buenker argues: Three waterways 
have been important to the development of the Midwest. The first and foremost 
was the Ohio River, which flowed into the Mississippi River. Development 
of the region was halted until 1795 due to Spain's control of the southern 
part of the Mississippi and its refusal to allow the shipment of American 
crops down the river and into the Atlantic Ocean.[citation needed] The 
second waterway is the network of routes within the Great Lakes. The opening 
of the Erie Canal in 1825 completed an all-water shipping route, more direct 
than the Mississippi, to New York and the seaport of New York City. In 
1848, The Illinois and Michigan Canal breached the continental divide spanning 
the Chicago Portage and linking the waters of the Great Lakes with those 
of the Mississippi Valley and the Gulf of Mexico. Lakeport and river cities 
grew up to handle these new shipping routes. During the Industrial Revolution, 
the lakes became a conduit for iron ore from the Mesabi Range of Minnesota 
to steel mills in the Mid-Atlantic States. The Saint Lawrence Seaway (1862, 
widened 1959) opened the Midwest to the Atlantic Ocean.[citation needed] 
The third waterway, the Missouri River, extended water travel from the 
Mississippi almost to the Rocky Mountains.[citation needed] In the 1870s 
and 1880s, the Mississippi River inspired two classic books—Life on the 
Mississippi and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn—written by native Missourian 
Samuel Clemens, who used the pseudonym Mark Twain. His stories became staples 
of Midwestern lore. Twain's hometown of Hannibal, Missouri is a tourist 
attraction offering a glimpse into the Midwest of his time.[citation needed] 
Inland canals in Ohio and Indiana constituted another important waterway, 
which connected with Great Lakes and Ohio River traffic. The commodities 
that the Midwest funneled into the Erie Canal down the Ohio River contributed 
to the wealth of New York City, which overtook Boston and Philadelphia.[citation 
needed] During the mid-19th century, the region got its first railroads, 
and the railroad junction in Chicago became the world's largest. During 
the century, Chicago became the nation's railroad center. By 1910, over 
20 railroads operated passenger service out of six different downtown terminals. 
Even today, a century after Henry Ford, six Class I railroads meet in Chicago. 
[37][38] In the period from 1890 to 1930, many Midwestern cities were connected 
by electric interurban railroads, similar to streetcars. The Midwest had 
more interurbans than any other region. In 1916, Ohio led all states with 
2,798 miles (4,503 km), Indiana followed with 1,825 miles (2,937 km). These 
two states alone had almost a third of the country's interurban trackage.[39] 
The nation's largest interurban junction was in Indianapolis. During the 
1900s (decade), the city's 38 percent growth in population was attributed 
largely to the interurban.[40] Competition with automobiles and buses undermined 
the interurban and other railroad passenger business. By 1900, Detroit 
was the world center of the auto industry, and soon practically every city 
within 200 miles was producing auto parts that fed into its giant factories.[41] 
In 1903, Henry Ford founded the Ford Motor Company. Ford's manufacturing—and 
those of automotive pioneers William C. Durant, the Dodge brothers, Packard, 
and Walter Chrysler—established Detroit's status in the early 20th century 
as the world's automotive capital. The proliferation of businesses created 
a synergy that also encouraged truck manufacturers such as Rapid and Grabowsky.[42] 
The growth of the auto industry was reflected by changes in businesses 
throughout the Midwest and nation, with the development of garages to service 
vehicles and gas stations, as well as factories for parts and tires. Today, 
greater Detroit remains home to General Motors, Chrysler, and the Ford 
Motor Company.[citation needed] The Northwest Ordinance region, comprising 
the heart of the Midwest, was the first large region of the United States 
that prohibited slavery (the Northeastern United States emancipated slaves 
in the 1830s). The regional southern boundary was the Ohio River, the border 
of freedom and slavery in American history and literature (see Uncle Tom's 
Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe and Beloved by Toni Morrison). The Midwest, 
particularly Ohio, provided the primary routes for the Underground Railroad, 
whereby Midwesterners assisted slaves to freedom from their crossing of 
the Ohio River through their departure on Lake Erie to Canada. Created 
in the early 19th century, the Underground Railroad was at its height between 
1850 and 1860. One estimate suggests that by 1850, 100,000 slaves had escaped 
via the Underground Railroad.[43] The Underground Railroad consisted of 
meeting points, secret routes, transportation, and safe houses and assistance 
provided by abolitionist sympathizers. Individuals were often organized 
in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals 
knew some connecting "stations" along the route, but knew few details of 
their immediate area. Escaped slaves would move north along the route from 
one way station to the next. Although the fugitives sometimes traveled 
on boat or train, they usually traveled on foot or by wagon.[44] The region 
was shaped by the relative absence of slavery (except for Missouri), pioneer 
settlement, education in one-room free public schools, democratic notions 
brought by American Revolutionary War veterans, Protestant faiths and experimentation, 
and agricultural wealth transported on the Ohio River riverboats, flatboats, 
canal boats, and railroads.[citation needed] The first violent conflicts 
leading up to the Civil War occurred between two neighboring Midwestern 
states, Kansas and Missouri, involving anti-slavery Free-Staters and pro-slavery 
"Border Ruffian" elements, that took place in the Kansas Territory and 
the western frontier towns of Missouri roughly between 1854 and 1858. At 
the heart of the conflict was the question of whether Kansas would enter 
the Union as a free state or slave state. As such, Bleeding Kansas was 
a proxy war between Northerners and Southerners over the issue of slavery. 
The term "Bleeding Kansas" was coined by Horace Greeley of the New York 
Tribune; the events it encompasses directly presaged the Civil War.[citation 
needed] Setting in motion the events later known as "Bleeding Kansas" was 
the Kansas-Nebraska Act. The Act created the territories of Kansas and 
Nebraska, opened new lands that would help settlement in them, repealed 
the Missouri Compromise, and allowed settlers in those territories to determine 
through popular sovereignty whether to allow slavery within their boundaries. 
It was hoped the Act would ease relations between the North and the South, 
because the South could expand slavery to new territories, but the North 
still had the right to abolish slavery in its states. Instead, opponents 
denounced the law as a concession to the slave power of the South.[citation 
needed] The new Republican Party, born in the Midwest (Ripon, Wisconsin, 
1854) and created in opposition to the Act, aimed to stop the expansion 
of slavery and soon emerged as the dominant force throughout the North.[45] 
An ostensibly democratic idea, popular sovereignty stated that the inhabitants 
of each territory or state should decide whether it would be a free or 
slave state; however, this resulted in immigration en masse to Kansas by 
activists from both sides. At one point, Kansas had two separate governments, 
each with its own constitution, although only one was federally recognized. 
On January 29, 1861, Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state, 
less than three months before the Battle of Fort Sumter officially began 
the Civil War.[46] The calm in Kansas was shattered in May 1856 by two 
events that are often regarded as the opening shots of the Civil War. On 
May 21, the Free Soil town of Lawrence, Kansas was sacked by an armed pro‐slavery 
force from Missouri. A few days later, the Sacking of Lawrence led abolitionist 
John Brown and six of his followers to execute five men along the Pottawatomie 
Creek in Franklin County, Kansas, in retaliation.[47] The so-called "Border 
War" lasted for another four months, from May through October, between 
armed bands of pro‐slavery and Free Soil men. The U.S. Army had two garrisons 
in Kansas, the First Cavalry Regiment at Fort Leavenworth and the Second 
Dragoons and Sixth Infantry at Fort Riley.[48] The skirmishes endured until 
a new governor, John W. Geary, managed to prevail upon the Missourians 
to return home in late 1856. A fragile peace followed, but violent outbreaks 
continued intermittently for several more years.[citation needed] National 
reaction to the events in Kansas demonstrated how deeply divided the country 
had become. The Border Ruffians were widely applauded in the South, even 
though their actions had cost the lives of numerous people. In the North, 
the murders committed by Brown and his followers were ignored by most and 
lauded by a few.[49] The civil conflict in Kansas was a product of the 
political fight over slavery. Federal troops were not used to decide a 
political question, but they were used by successive territorial governors 
to pacify the territory so that the political question of slavery in Kansas 
could finally be decided by peaceful, legal, and political means.[citation 
needed] The election of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860 was the final 
trigger for secession by the Southern states.[50] Efforts at compromise, 
including the "Corwin Amendment" and the Crittenden Compromise, failed. 
Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery 
and put it on a course toward extinction.[citation needed] The U.S. federal 
government was supported by 20 mostly-Northern free states in which slavery 
already had been abolished, and by five slave states that became known 
as the border states. All of the Midwestern states but one, Missouri, banned 
slavery. Though most battles were fought in the South, skirmishes between 
Kansas and Missouri continued until culmination with the Lawrence Massacre 
on August 21, 1863. Also known as Quantrill's Raid, the massacre was a 
rebel guerrilla attack by Quantrill's Raiders, led by William Clarke Quantrill, 
on pro-Union Lawrence, Kansas. Quantrill's band of 448 Missouri guerrillas 
raided and plundered Lawrence, killing more than 150 and burning all the 
business buildings and most of the dwellings. Pursued by federal troops, 
the band escaped to Missouri.[51] Lawrence was targeted due to the town's 
long support of abolition and its reputation as a center for Redlegs and 
Jayhawkers, which were free-state militia and vigilante groups known for 
attacking and families in Missouri's pro-slavery western counties.[citation 
needed] By the time of the American Civil War, European immigrants bypassed 
the East Coast of the United States to settle directly in the interior: 
German immigrants to Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois, and 
Missouri; Irish immigrants to port cities on the Great Lakes, especially 
Chicago; Danes, Swedes, and Norwegians to Iowa, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Minnesota, 
and the Dakotas; and Finns to Upper Michigan and northern/central Minnesota. 
Poles, Hungarians, and Jews settled in Midwestern cities.[citation needed] 
The U.S. was predominantly rural at the time of the Civil War. The Midwest 
was no exception, dotted with small farms all across the region. The late 
19th century saw industrialization, immigration, and urbanization that 
fed the Industrial Revolution, and the heart of industrial domination and 
innovation was in the Great Lakes states of the Midwest, which only began 
its slow decline by the late 20th century.[citation needed] A flourishing 
economy brought residents from rural communities and immigrants from abroad. 
Manufacturing and retail and finance sectors became dominant, influencing 
the American economy.[52] In addition to manufacturing, printing, publishing, 
and food processing also play major roles in the Midwest's largest economy. 
Chicago was the base of commercial operations for industrialists John Crerar, 
John Whitfield Bunn, Richard Teller Crane, Marshall Field, John Farwell, 
Julius Rosenwald and many other commercial visionaries who laid the foundation 
for Midwestern and global industry.[citation needed] In the 20th century, 
African American migration from the Southern United States into the Midwestern 
states changed Chicago, St. Louis, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Kansas City, Cincinnati, 
Detroit, Omaha, Minneapolis and many other cities in the Midwest, as factories 
and schools enticed families by the thousands to new opportunities. Chicago 
alone gained hundreds of thousands of black citizens from the Great Migration 
and the Second Great Migration.[citation needed] The Gateway Arch monument 
in St. Louis, clad in stainless steel and built in the form of a flattened 
catenary arch,[53] is the tallest man-made monument in the United States,[54] 
and the world's tallest arch.[54] Built as a monument to the westward expansion 
of the United States,[53] it is the centerpiece of the Jefferson National 
Expansion Memorial and has become an internationally famous symbol of St. 
Louis and the Midwest.[citation needed] As the Midwest opened up to settlement 
via waterways and rail in the mid-1800s, Germans began to settle there 
in large numbers. The largest flow of German immigration to America occurred 
between 1820 and World War I, during which time nearly six million Germans 
immigrated to the United States. From 1840 to 1880, they were the largest 
group of immigrants.[citation needed] The Midwestern cities of Milwaukee, 
Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Chicago were favored destinations of German 
immigrants. By 1900, the populations of the cities of Cleveland, Milwaukee, 
Hoboken, and Cincinnati were all more than 40 percent German American. 
Dubuque and Davenport, Iowa, had even larger proportions; in Omaha, Nebraska, 
the proportion of German Americans was 57 percent in 1910. In many other 
cities of the Midwest, such as Fort Wayne, Indiana, German Americans were 
at least 30 percent of the population.[55][56] Many concentrations acquired 
distinctive names suggesting their heritage, such as the "Over-the-Rhine" 
district in Cincinnati and "German Village" in Columbus, Ohio.[57] A favorite 
destination was Milwaukee, known as "the German Athens". Radical Germans 
trained in politics in the old country dominated the city's Socialists. 
Skilled workers dominated many crafts, while entrepreneurs created the 
brewing industry; the most famous brands included Pabst, Schlitz, Miller, 
and Blatz.[58] While half of German immigrants settled in cities, the other 
half established farms in the Midwest. From Ohio to the Plains states, 
a heavy presence persists in rural areas into the 21st century.[59][60][61] 
Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, German Americans showed a high 
interest in becoming farmers, and keeping their children and grandchildren 
on the land. Western railroads, with large land grants available to attract 
farmers, set up agencies in Hamburg and other German cities, promising 
cheap transportation, and sales of farmland on easy terms. For example, 
the Santa Fe Railroad hired its own commissioner for immigration, and sold 
over 300,000 acres (1,200 km2) to German-speaking farmers.[62] The term 
West was applied to the region in the early years of the country. In 1789, 
the Northwest Ordinance was enacted, creating the Northwest Territory, 
which was bounded by the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. 
Because the Northwest Territory lay between the East Coast and the then-far-West, 
the states carved out of it were called the Northwest. In the early 19th 
century, anything west of the Mississippi River was considered the West. 
The first recorded use of the term Midwestern to refer to a region of the 
central U.S. occurred in 1886, Midwest appeared in 1894, and Midwesterner 
in 1916.[5] Following the settlement of the western prairie, some considered 
the row of states from North Dakota to Kansas to be part of the Midwest.[63] 
The states of the "old Northwest" are now called the "East North Central 
States" by the United States Census Bureau and the "Great Lakes region" 
is also a popular term. The states just west of the Mississippi River and 
the Great Plains states are called the "West North Central States" by the 
Census Bureau.[citation needed] Some entities in the Midwest are still 
referred to as "Northwest" due to historical reasons (for example, Northwestern 
University in Illinois).[citation needed] The most common definition currently 
used colloquially is that the Midwest proper includes, for the most part, 
only the East North Central States of the Great Lakes region, specifically 
Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Minnesota, and in addition 
Iowa and Missouri are also usually understood to share the same regional 
characteristics.[64] Agriculture is one of the biggest drivers of local 
economies in the Midwest, accounting for billions of dollars worth of exports 
and thousands of jobs. The area consists of some of the richest farming 
land in the world.[65] The region's fertile soil combined with the steel 
plow has made it possible for farmers to produce abundant harvests of grain 
and cereal crops, including corn, wheat, soybeans, oats, and barley, to 
become known today as the nation's "breadbasket."[66] Farms spread from 
the colonies westward along with the settlers. In cooler regions, wheat 
was often the crop of choice when lands were newly settled, leading to 
a "wheat frontier" that moved westward over the course of years. Also very 
common in the antebellum Midwest was farming corn while raising hogs, complementing 
each other especially since it was difficult to get grain to market before 
the canals and railroads. After the "wheat frontier" had passed through 
an area, more diversified farms including dairy and beef cattle generally 
took its place.[citation needed] The very dense soil of the Midwest plagued 
the first settlers who were using wooden plows, which were more suitable 
for loose forest soil. On the prairie, the plows bounced around and the 
soil stuck to them. This problem was solved in 1837 by an Illinois blacksmith 
named John Deere who developed a steel moldboard plow that was stronger 
and cut the roots, making the fertile soils of the prairie ready for farming.[citation 
needed] The tallgrass prairie has been converted into one of the most intensive 
crop producing areas in North America. Less than one tenth of one percent 
(<0.09%) of the original landcover of the tallgrass prairie biome remains.[67] 
States formerly with landcover in native tallgrass prairie such as Iowa, 
Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska, and Missouri have become valued 
for their highly productive soils and are included in the Corn Belt. As 
an example of this land use intensity, Illinois and Iowa rank 49th and 
50th out of 50 states in total uncultivated land remaining.[citation needed] 
The introduction and broad adoption of scientific agriculture since the 
mid-19th century contributed to economic growth in the United States. This 
development was facilitated by the Morrill Act and the Hatch Act of 1887 
which established in each state a land-grant university (with a mission 
to teach and study agriculture) and a federally funded system of agricultural 
experiment stations and cooperative extension networks which place extension 
agents in each state. Iowa State University became the nation's first designated 
land-grant institution when the Iowa Legislature accepted the provisions 
of the 1862 Morrill Act on September 11, 1862, making Iowa the first state 
in the nation to do so.[68] The Corn Belt is a region of the Midwest where 
corn has, since the 1850s, been the predominant crop, replacing the native 
tall grasses. The "Corn Belt" region is defined typically to include Iowa, 
Illinois, Indiana, southern Michigan, western Ohio, eastern Nebraska, eastern 
Kansas, southern Minnesota, and parts of Missouri.[69] As of 2008, the 
top four corn-producing states were Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, and Minnesota, 
together accounting for more than half of the corn grown in the United 
States.[70] The Corn Belt also sometimes is defined to include parts of 
South Dakota, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Kentucky.[71] The region is 
characterized by relatively level land and deep, fertile soils, high in 
organic matter.[72] Former Vice President Henry A. Wallace, a pioneer of 
hybrid seeds, declared in 1956 that the Corn Belt developed the "most productive 
agricultural civilization the world has ever seen".[73] Today, the U.S. 
produces 40 percent of the world crop.[74] Iowa produces the largest corn 
crop of any state. In 2012, Iowa farmers produced 18.3 percent of the nation's 
corn, while Illinois produced 15.3 percent.[75] In 2011, there were 13.7 
million harvested acres of corn for grain, producing 2.36 billion bushels, 
which yielded 172.0 bu/acre, with US$14.5 billion of corn value of production.[76] 
Soybeans were not widely cultivated in the United States until the early 
1930s, and by 1942, it became the world's largest soybean producer, due 
in part to World War II and the "need for domestic sources of fats, oils, 
and meal". Between 1930 and 1942, the United States' share of world soybean 
production skyrocketed from three percent to 46.5 percent, largely due 
to the Midwest, and by 1969, it had risen to 76 percent.[77] Iowa and Illinois 
rank first and second in the nation in soybean production. In 2012, Iowa 
produced 14.5 percent, and Illinois produced 13.3 percent of the nation's 
soybeans.[75] Wheat is produced throughout the Midwest and is the principal 
cereal grain in the country. The U.S. is ranked third in production volume 
of wheat, with almost 58 million tons produced in the 2012-2013 growing 
season, behind only China and India (the combined production of all European 
Union nations is larger than China)[78] The U.S. ranks first in crop export 
volume; almost 50 percent of total wheat produced is exported.[citation 
needed] The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines eight official classes 
of wheat: durum wheat, hard red spring wheat, hard red winter wheat, soft 
red winter wheat, hard white wheat, soft white wheat, unclassed wheat, 
and mixed wheat.[79] Winter wheat accounts for 70 to 80 percent of total 
production in the U.S., with the largest amounts produced in Kansas (10.8 
million tons) and North Dakota (9.8 million tons). Of the total wheat produced 
in the country, 50 percent is exported, valued at US$9 billion.[80] Midwestern 
states also lead the nation in other agricultural commodities, including 
pork (Iowa), beef and veal (Nebraska), dairy (Wisconsin), and eggs (Iowa).[75] 
Chicago is the economic and financial heartbeat of the Midwest and has 
the third largest gross metropolitan product in the United States—approximately 
$532 billion according to 2010 estimates,[81][82] after only the urban 
agglomerations of New York City and Los Angeles, in the first and second 
place, respectively. Chicago was named the fourth most important business 
center in the world in the MasterCard Worldwide Centers of Commerce Index.[83] 
The Chicago Board of Trade (established 1848) listed the first ever standardized 
'exchange traded' forward contracts, which were called futures contracts.[84] 
In 1883, the standardized system of North American time zones was adopted 
by the general time convention of railway managers in Chicago.[85] This 
gave the continent its uniform system for telling time.[citation needed] 
As a major world financial center, the city is home to the headquarters 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (the Seventh District of the Federal 
Reserve). The city is also home to major financial and futures exchanges, 
including the Chicago Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange 
(CBOE), and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the "Merc"), which is owned, 
along with the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) by Chicago's CME Group. The 
CME Group, in addition, owns the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), 
the Commodities Exchange Inc. (COMEX) and the Dow Jones Indexes.[86] Like 
the rest of the United States, the Midwest is predominantly Christian.[87] 
Roman Catholicism is the largest religion in the Midwest, varying between 
18 percent and 34 percent of the state populations.[88][89] Southern Baptists 
compose about 15 percent of Missouri's population[90] and smaller percentages 
in other Midwestern states. Many Midwesterners are Protestant with rates 
from 48 percent in Illinois to 63 percent in Iowa.[91] Lutherans are prevalent 
in the Upper Midwest, especially in Minnesota and the Dakotas with their 
large Scandinavian and German populations.[citation needed] Judaism is 
practiced by 2.5 percent and Islam is practiced by 1 percent or less of 
the population, with higher concentrations in major urban areas. People 
with no religious affiliation make up 13–16 percent of the Midwest's population. 
Surveys show 54 percent of Midwesterners regularly attend church.[92] Many 
Midwestern universities, both public and private, are members of the Association 
of American Universities (AAU), an international organization of leading 
public and private research universities devoted to maintaining a strong 
system of academic research and education. Of the 62 members from the U.S. 
and Canada, 16 are located in the Midwest including private schools Case 
Western Reserve University, Northwestern University, the University of 
Chicago, and Washington University in St. Louis. Member public institutions 
of the AAU include the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Indiana 
University Bloomington, the University of Iowa, Iowa State University, 
the University of Kansas, the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, 
the University of Minnesota, the University of Missouri, Ohio State University, 
Purdue University, and the University of Wisconsin–Madison.[93] Other notable 
major research-intensive public universities include the University of 
Cincinnati, Kansas State University, and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.[citation 
needed] Numerous state university systems have established regional campuses 
statewide. The numerous state teachers colleges were upgraded into state 
universities after 1945.[94] Other notable private institutions include 
the University of Notre Dame, DePaul University, Creighton University, 
Drake University, and Marquette University. Local boosters, usually with 
a church affiliation, created numerous colleges in the mid-19th century.[95] 
In terms of national rankings, the most prominent today include Carleton 
College, Denison University, DePauw University, Earlham College, Grinnell 
College, Kalamazoo College, Kenyon College, Macalester College, Lawrence 
University, Oberlin College, Wheaton College, and The College of Wooster.[96] 
The heavy German immigration played a major role in establishing musical 
traditions, especially choral and orchestral music.[97] Czech and German 
traditions combined to sponsor the polka.[98] The African American migration 
from the South brought jazz to the Midwest, along with blues, and rock 
and roll, with major contributions to jazz, funk, and R&B, and even new 
subgenres such as the Motown Sound and techno from Detroit[99] or house 
music from Chicago. In the 1920s, South Side Chicago was the base for Jelly 
Roll Morton (1890-1941). Kansas City developed its own jazz style.[100] 
The electrified Chicago blues sound exemplifies the genre, as popularized 
by record labels Chess and Alligator and portrayed in such films as The 
Blues Brothers, Godfathers and Sons, and Adventures in Babysitting.[citation 
needed] Rock and roll music was first identified as a new genre in 1951 
by Cleveland, Ohio, disc jockey Alan Freed who began playing this music 
style while popularizing the term "rock and roll" to describe it.[101] 
By the mid-1950s, rock and roll emerged as a defined musical style in the 
United States, deriving most directly from the rhythm and blues music of 
the 1940s, which itself developed from earlier blues, boogie woogie, jazz, 
and swing music, and was also influenced by gospel, country and western, 
and traditional folk music. Freed's contribution in identifying rock as 
a new genre helped establish the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, located in 
Cleveland. Chuck Berry, a Midwesterner from St. Louis, was among the first 
successful rock and roll artists and influenced many other rock musicians.[citation 
needed] Notable soul and R&B musicians associated with Motown that had 
their origins in the area include Aretha Franklin, The Supremes, Mary Wells, 
Four Tops, The Jackson 5, Smokey Robinson & the Miracles, Stevie Wonder, 
The Marvelettes, The Temptations, and Martha and the Vandellas. These artists 
achieved their greatest success in the 1960s and 1970s. Michael Jackson, 
from the Jackson 5, went on to have an extremely successful solo career 
from the 1970s through the 2000s. Known as the "King of Pop", he went on 
to become one of the bestselling solo artists of all time and the most-awarded 
artist of all time. His sister, Janet Jackson, also had an extremely successful 
solo career in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.[citation needed] In the 1970s 
and 1980s, native Midwestern musicians such as John Mellencamp and Bob 
Seger found great success with a style of rock music that came to be known 
as heartland rock, which were characterized by lyrical themes that focused 
on and appealed to the Midwestern working class. Other successful Midwestern 
rock artists emerged during this time, including REO Speedwagon, Styx, 
and Kansas.[citation needed] In the 1990s, the Chicago-based band The Smashing 
Pumpkins emerged and went on to become one of the most successful alternative 
rock artists of the decade. Also in the 1990s, the Midwest was at the center 
of the emerging emo movement, with bands like The Get Up Kids (Kansas), 
Cursive (Nebraska) and Cap'n Jazz (Illinois) blending earlier hardcore 
punk sounds with a more melodic indie rock sentiment. This hybrid of styles 
came to be known as Midwest emo. Chicago-based artists Fall Out Boy and 
Plain White T's popularized the genre in the early part of the 21st century.[citation 
needed] In the late 1990s, Eminem and Kid Rock emerged from the Detroit 
area. Eminem went on to become one of the most commercially successful 
and critically acclaimed rappers of all time. Meanwhile, Kid Rock successfully 
mixed elements of rap, hard rock, heavy metal, country rock, and pop in 
forming his own unique sound. Both artists are known for celebrating their 
Detroit roots.[citation needed] Numerous classical composers live and have 
lived in midwestern states, including Easley Blackwood, Kenneth Gaburo, 
Salvatore Martirano, and Ralph Shapey (Illinois); Glenn Miller and Meredith 
Willson (Iowa); Leslie Bassett, William Bolcom, Michael Daugherty, and 
David Gillingham (Michigan); Donald Erb (Ohio); Dominick Argento and Stephen 
Paulus (Minnesota). Also notable is Peter Schickele, born in Iowa and partially 
raised in North Dakota, best known for his classical music parodies attributed 
to his alter ego of P. D. Q. Bach.[citation needed] Professional sports 
leagues such as the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball 
(MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL) 
and Major League Soccer (MLS) have team franchises in several Midwestern 
cities:[citation needed] Successful teams include the St. Louis Cardinals 
(11 World Series titles), Chicago Bulls (6 NBA titles), the Detroit Pistons 
(3 NBA titles), the Green Bay Packers (4 Super Bowl titles, 13 total NFL 
championships), the Detroit Red Wings (11 Stanley Cup titles), and the 
Chicago Blackhawks (6 Stanley Cup titles).[citation needed] In NCAA college 
sports, the Big Ten Conference and the Big 12 Conference feature the largest 
concentration of top Midwestern Division I football and men's and women's 
basketball teams in the region, including the Illinois Fighting Illini, 
Indiana Hoosiers, Iowa Hawkeyes, Iowa State Cyclones, Kansas Jayhawks, 
Kansas State Wildcats, Michigan Wolverines, Michigan State Spartans, Minnesota 
Golden Gophers, Nebraska Cornhuskers, Northwestern Wildcats, Ohio State 
Buckeyes, Purdue Boilermakers, and the Wisconsin Badgers.[citation needed] 
Other notable Midwestern college sports teams include the Butler Bulldogs, 
Cincinnati Bearcats, Creighton Bluejays, Dayton Flyers, Indiana State Sycamores, 
Marquette Golden Eagles, Milwaukee Panthers, Missouri Tigers, Missouri 
State Bears, Northern Illinois Huskies, Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Western 
Michigan Broncos, Wichita State Shockers, and Xavier Musketeers. Of this 
second group of schools, Butler, Dayton and Missouri State do not play 
top-level college football, and Creighton, Marquette, Wichita State, and 
Xavier do not sponsor football at all.[citation needed] The Milwaukee Mile 
hosted its first motor race in 1903, and is one of the oldest tracks in 
the world. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway, opened in 1909, is a prestigious 
auto racing track which annually hosts the Indianapolis 500, the Brickyard 
400, and the Indianapolis Motorcycle Grand Prix. The Road America and Mid-Ohio 
road courses opened in the 1950s and 1960s respectively. Other motorsport 
venues in the Midwest are Indianapolis Raceway Park, Michigan International 
Speedway, Chicagoland Speedway, Kansas Speedway, Gateway International 
Raceway, and the Iowa Speedway. The Kentucky Speedway is just outside the 
officially defined Midwest, but is linked with the region because the track 
is located in the Cincinnati metropolitan area.[citation needed] Notable 
professional golf tournaments in the Midwest include the WGC-Bridgestone 
Invitational, Memorial Tournament, BMW Championship and John Deere Classic.[citation 
needed] Differences in the definition of the Midwest mainly split between 
the Great Plains region on one side, and the Great Lakes region on the 
other. While some point to the small towns and agricultural communities 
in Kansas, Iowa, the Dakotas, and Nebraska of the Great Plains as representative 
of traditional Midwestern lifestyles and values, others assert that the 
industrial cities of the Great Lakes—with their histories of 19th- and 
early-20th-century immigration, manufacturing base, and strong Catholic 
influence—are more representative of the Midwestern experience. In South 
Dakota, for instance, West River (the region west of the Missouri River) 
shares cultural elements with the western United States, while East River 
has more in common with the rest of the Midwest.[102] Two other regions, 
Appalachia and the Ozark Mountains, overlap geographically with the Midwest—Appalachia 
in Southern Ohio and the Ozarks in Southern Missouri. The Ohio River has 
long been a boundary between North and South and between the Midwest and 
the Upper South. All of the lower Midwestern states, especially Missouri, 
have a major Southern component, and Missouri was a slave state before 
the Civil War.[citation needed] Western Pennsylvania, which contains the 
cities of Erie and Pittsburgh, plus the Western New York cities of Buffalo 
and possibly Rochester, share history with the Midwest, but overlap with 
Appalachia and the Northeast as well.[103] Kentucky is rarely considered 
part of the Midwest, although it can be grouped with it in some contexts.[104] 
It is categorized as Southern by the Census Bureau and is usually classified 
as such, especially from a cultural standpoint.[105][106] In addition to 
intra-American regional overlaps, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan has historically 
had strong cultural ties to Canada, partly as a result of early settlement 
by French Canadians. Moreover, the Yooper accent shares some traits with 
Canadian English, further demonstrating transnational cultural connections. 
Similar but less pronounced mutual Canadian-American cultural influence 
occurs throughout the Great Lakes region.[citation needed] The accents 
of the region are generally distinct from those of the South and of the 
urban areas of the American Northeast. To a lesser degree, they are also 
distinct from the accent of the American West.[citation needed] The accent 
characteristic of most of the Midwest is considered by many to be that 
of "standard" American English or General American. This accent is preferred 
by many national radio and television broadcasters.[107] This may have 
started because many prominent broadcast personalities—such as Walter Cronkite, 
Harry Reasoner, Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Rush Limbaugh, Tom Brokaw, 
John Madden, and Casey Kasem—came from this region and so created this 
perception. A November 1998 National Geographic article attributed the 
high number of telemarketing firms in Omaha to the "neutral accents" of 
the area's inhabitants. Currently, many cities in the Great Lakes region 
are undergoing the Northern cities vowel shift away from the standard pronunciation 
of vowels.[108] The dialect of Minnesota, western Wisconsin, much of North 
Dakota and Michigan's Upper Peninsula is referred to as the Upper Midwestern 
Dialect (or "Minnesotan"), and has Scandinavian and Canadian[citation needed] 
influences.[citation needed] Missouri has elements of three dialects, specifically: 
Northern Midland, in the extreme northern part of the state, with a distinctive 
variation in St. Louis and the surrounding area; Southern Midland, in the 
majority of the state; and Southern, in the southwestern and southeastern 
parts of the state, with a bulge extending north in the central part, to 
include approximately the southern one-third.[109] The rate of potentially 
preventable hospital discharges in the Midwestern United States fell from 
2005 to 2011 for overall conditions, acute conditions, and chronic conditions.[110] 
All cities listed have a population of 250,000 or more. The Midwest has 
been an important region in national elections, with highly contested elections 
in closely divided states often deciding the national result. In 1860–1920, 
both parties often selected either their president or vice president from 
the region.[111] One of the two major political parties in the United States, 
the Republican Party, originated in the Midwest in the 1850s; Ripon, Wisconsin 
had the first local meeting while Jackson, Michigan had the state county 
meeting of the new party. Its membership included many Yankees who had 
settled the upper Midwest. The party opposed the expansion of slavery and 
stressed the Protestant ideals of thrift, a hard work ethic, self-reliance, 
democratic decision making, and religious tolerance.[112] In the early 
1890s the wheat-growing regions were strongholds of the short-lived Populist 
movement in the Plains states.[113] Starting in the 1890s the middle class 
urban Progressive movement became influential in the region (as it was 
in other regions), with Wisconsin a major center. Under the LaFolletes 
Wisconsin fought against the GOP bosses and for efficiency, modernization, 
and the use of experts to solve social, economic, and political problems. 
Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 Progressive Party had the best showing in this 
region; carrying the states of Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota. In 
1924, La Follette, Sr.'s 1924 Progressive Party did well in the region, 
but only carried his home base of Wisconsin.[citation needed] The Midwest—especially 
the areas west of Chicago—has always been a stronghold of isolationism, 
a belief that America should not involve itself in foreign entanglements. 
This position was largely based on the many German American and Swedish-American 
communities. Isolationist leaders included the La Follettes, Ohio's Robert 
A. Taft, and Colonel Robert McCormick, publisher of the Chicago Tribune.[114][115] 
As of 2016, the Midwest is home to several critical swing states that do 
not have a strong allegiance to either the Democratic or Republican party 
including Iowa, Missouri and Ohio. Upper Midwestern states, of Illinois, 
Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin tend to vote Democratic supporting the 
party's candidate in every presidential election since 1992. The Great 
Plains states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas have 
voted for the Republican candidate in every presidential election since 
1940, except for Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. Indiana is usually 
considered a Republican stronghold, voting that party's presidential candidate 
in every election since 1940 expect for Johnson in 1964 and Barack Obama 
in 2008.[citation needed] As a result of the 2014 elections, Republicans 
now control the governors' office in ten of the twelve Midwestern states, 
leaving only Minnesota and Missouri in Democratic hands. Republicans also 
control every partisan state legislature in the Midwest, except Illinois, 
Minnesota and Iowa. The unicameral Nebraska Legislature is officially nonpartisan.[citation 
needed] As of 2016 The state government of Illinois is currently divided 
between Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and Democratic super majorities 
and in the State House and State Senate. The state currently has one Republican 
senator, one Democratic senator, and a 12–6 Democratic majority US House 
of Representatives delegation.[citation needed] Many analysts[who?] consider 
Iowa the most evenly divided state in the country, but it has leaned Democratic 
for at least the past fifteen years.[when?] Iowa had a Democratic governor 
from 1999 until Terry Branstad was re-elected in the mid-term elections 
in 2010, and has had both one Democratic and one Republican senator since 
the early 1980s until the 2014 election when Republican Joni Ernst defeated 
Democrat Bruce Braley in a tightly contested race.[116] As for Iowa's House 
delegation, Republicans currently hold a 3 to 1 seat majority.[117] Iowa 
has also voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in five out of 
the last six elections, (1992, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012). As a result of 
the 2014 elections, Republicans hold a majority in the Iowa House of Representatives 
(53-47), while Democrats hold a majority in the Iowa Senate.[citation needed] 
Minnesota voters have not voted for a Republican candidate for president 
since 1972, longer than any other state. Minnesota was the only U.S. state 
(along with Washington, D.C.) to vote for its native son Walter Mondale 
over Ronald Reagan in 1984. In Iowa and Minnesota, however, the recent[when?] 
Democratic victories have often been fairly narrow. Minnesota has elected 
and re-elected a Republican governor (Tim Pawlenty), as well as supported 
some of the strongest gun concealment laws in the nation. Republicans held 
control of both houses of the Minnesota state legislature from 2011 to 
2013.[citation needed] Consistently, Ohio is a battleground state in presidential 
elections. No Republican has won the office without winning Ohio. This 
trend has contributed to Ohio's reputation as a quintessential swing state. 
At the state level, however, Republicans are currently[when?] dominant. 
With the exception of one justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio, all political 
offices open to statewide election are held by Republicans. Republicans 
have a majority in the Ohio House of Representatives and a supermajority 
in the Ohio Senate. At the federal level, Ohio has one Democratic and one 
Republican U.S. Senator.[when?] As a result of the 2012 elections, 12 of 
Ohio's 16 members of the U.S. House of Representatives are Republicans.[citation

and Kansas have been strongholds for the Republicans for many decades. 
These four states have gone for the Republican candidate in every presidential 
election since 1940, except for Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide over Barry 
Goldwater in 1964. Although North Dakota and South Dakota have often elected 
Democrats to Congress, after the 2012 election both states' congressional 
delegations are majority Republican. Nebraska has elected Democrats to 
the Senate and as Governor in recent years, but the state's House delegation 
has been all-Republican since 1995, and both of its Senators are Republican.[when?] 
Kansas has elected a majority of Democrats as governor since 1956, but 
has not elected a Democratic Senator since 1932. Both of Kansas's U.S. 
Senators and all four of its U.S. House members are Republican.[when?] 
Missouri was historically considered a "bellwether state", having voted 
for the winner in every presidential election since 1904, with three exceptions: 
in 1956 for Democrat Adlai Stevenson II; in 2008 for Republican John McCain; 
and in 2012 for Republican Mitt Romney. Missouri's House delegation has 
generally been evenly divided, with the Democrats holding sway in the large 
cities at the opposite ends of the state, Kansas City and St. Louis (although 
the Kansas City suburbs are now trending Republican), and the Republicans 
controlling the rest of the state, save for a pocket of Democratic strength 
in Columbia, home to the University of Missouri. However, as a result of 
the 2012 elections, Republicans now have a 6–2 majority in the state's 
House delegation, with African-American Democrats representing the major 
cities. Missouri's Senate seats were mostly controlled by Democrats until 
the latter part of the 20th century, but the Republicans have held one 
or both Senate seats continuously since 1976.[citation needed] All Midwestern 
states use primary election to select delegates to the both the Democratic 
and Republican national conventions, except for Iowa and Minnesota. The 
Iowa caucuses in early January of leap years are the first votes in the 
presidential nominating process for both major parties, and attract enormous 
media attention.[118] Midwest (United States of America) travel guide from
