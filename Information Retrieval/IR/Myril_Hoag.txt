Myril Oliver Hoag (March 9, 1908 â€“ July 28, 1971) was an American professional 
baseball player. An outfielder, Hoag played in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
for the New York Yankees, St. Louis Browns, Chicago White Sox, and Cleveland 
Indians between 1931 and 1945 and was on the winning team in three World 
Series. He appeared in the 1939 MLB All-Star Game. Hoag was born in Davis, 
California. He played from April 15, 1931, until September 16, 1945. He 
batted and threw right-handed. He had a lifetime batting average of .271 
with 28 home runs and 401 RBIs. After two seasons with the Sacramento Senators, 
Hoag signed with the New York Yankees after the 1930 season. He spent seven 
seasons with the Yankees over eight years (playing in 1933 with the Newark 
Bears). Hoag homered for the Yankees' first run as they won the final game 
of the 1937 World Series. He had a .320 batting average for his three World 
Series. In 1939, he made the American League All-Star team with the St. 
Louis Browns after the Yankees traded him there for Oral Hildebrand and 
Buster Mills. That year, he batted .295 with 75 RBIs and 202 total bases. 
He was fifth in the league in stolen bases in 1942 with the Chicago White 
Sox with 17, nearly double his second-best season (nine in 1939). Hoag 
ended his career with 854 hits in 3147 at bats. In 1934, he collected six 
hits in one game, and was the last New York Yankee to accomplish this feat
