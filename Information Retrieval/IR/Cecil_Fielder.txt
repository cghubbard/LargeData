Cecil Grant Fielder (/ˈsɛsəl/; born September 21, 1963) is a former professional 
baseball player who was a noted power hitter in the 1980s and 1990s. He 
attended college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). He played 
with the Toronto Blue Jays (1985–88), Hanshin Tigers (1989), Detroit Tigers 
(1990–96), New York Yankees (1996–97), Anaheim Angels and Cleveland Indians 
(both in 1998). With the Yankees, he won the 1996 World Series over the 
Atlanta Braves. In 1990, he became the first player to reach the 50-home 
run mark since George Foster hit 52 for the Cincinnati Reds in 1977. He 
is the father of former Texas Rangers first baseman Prince Fielder, who 
had similarly established himself as a premier power hitter during his 
career. Cecil Fielder was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 31st 
round of the 1981 amateur draft, but did not sign. He was drafted by the 
Kansas City Royals in the 4th round of the 1982 amateur draft, and this 
time did sign. In 1983, he was traded by the Royals to the Toronto Blue 
Jays for Leon Roberts. A part-time first and third baseman for the Blue 
Jays, Fielder had hit 31 home runs with 84 runs batted in during four seasons. 
With Toronto, he earned $125,000 per season. The Hanshin Tigers signed 
him after the 1988 season, paying him $1,050,000 ($1,968,644 today), including 
a chauffeur and a full-time interpreter. More than the money, he said, 
he went to Japan for the opportunity to play every day.[citation needed] 
In the beginning of spring training, Fielder had a difficult time adjusting 
to Japan's baseball culture, however, with the help of Tiger manager Minoru 
Murayama and Junichi Kashiwabara, he became adjusted to the new environment. 
The Tigers offered Fielder the position of cleanup hitter, and he became 
a hero to the local baseball fans, who nicknamed him "Wild Bear"[citation 
needed] (wild, in Japan, is the image of power; bear, for his hulking presence). 
Fielder, built for power at 6-foot-3 and 280 pounds, gained the Detroit 
Tigers' attention by hitting 38 home runs in Japan's Central League in 
1989, and he returned to the U.S. Once again in the majors with Detroit 
Tigers, Fielder, with his 51-homer, 132 RBI year in 1990, became one of 
the biggest stories of the season – and perhaps the biggest bargain in 
the sport (he earned $1.25 million). On the last day of the Tigers' season 
at Yankee Stadium, Fielder hit his 50th and 51st home runs to become the 
11th player in ML history – and only the second in the previous 25 years 
– to reach the 50-HR plateau.[1] No Detroit Tigers player had turned the 
mark since Hank Greenberg slugged 58 in 1938, and no Tiger player has reached 
50 HR since. Fielder, whose previous high mark was 14 with Toronto in 1987, 
provided a sudden and unexpected emergence as a legitimate slugger. In 
addition to his 51 homers, Fielder also led the American League in RBI 
and total bases (339) that season. In 1990, Fielder also became the fourth 
American League player to ever have two 3-home run games in a season. With 
his 44 home runs in 1991, Cecil joined Hank Greenberg (1937–38) as the 
only Tiger players at that time to hit 40 or more homers in consecutive 
seasons.[2] (Miguel Cabrera joined Fielder and Greenberg in 2012–13.) Fielder 
repeated as AL RBI champion with 133 driven in that season. In 1992, Fielder 
avoided salary arbitration by agreeing to a 1-year, $4.5 million contract, 
which at the time set a record for highest salary by an arbitration-eligible 
player. Fielder responded by leading the league in RBI (124) for the third 
consecutive season, becoming the first American Leaguer since Babe Ruth 
to do so.[3] During the 1990s, Fielder built a reputation for clutch hitting 
and power, though the Tigers continued to be no better than mediocre. His 
team's fates possibly hurt him with MVP voters. Rickey Henderson and Cal 
Ripken, Jr. narrowly edged him for the AL's MVP Award in 1990 and 1991, 
respectively. His new fans in Detroit nicknamed him "Big Daddy" for his 
big smile, peaceful temperament, and prodigious home runs (as well as his 
massive physical stature).[4][5] In his six-year tenure with Detroit, Fielder 
had four consecutive 30-homer and 100-RBI seasons, and if the 1994 season 
had not been strike-shortened he almost certainly would have had another 
(he had 28 HRs and 90 RBI in 109 games that year). He also became the first 
Tiger ever to hit at least 25 homers in six consecutive seasons. No player 
in Detroit history hit as many over a six-year period (219) until Miguel 
Cabrera hit 227 in 2008–13, and no major league player had more home runs 
between 1990 and 1995. Fielder was a member of the All-Star Team in 1990, 
1991, and 1993. Fielder was named "Tiger of the Year" by the Detroit chapter 
of the BBWAA in 1990, 1991, and 1992. He is the only player to receive 
the award three consecutive years.[6] In 1993, Fielder signed a 5-year, 
$36 million contract with the Tigers; which made him the highest paid player 
in baseball for 2 seasons (1995 and 1996).[7] Fielder had a reputation 
as something of a slow baserunner.[8] In 1996 set a major league record 
by taking 1,096 games to record his first career stolen base, which occurred 
on a botched hit and run. He stole another base that season as well, and 
finished his career with 2 stolen bases over 13 seasons and 1,470 games.[4] 
Fielder also had a reputation as a below average fielder, mostly caused 
by his poor speed and range. He was however, considered a competent defensive 
first baseman when it came to putouts and digging infield assists out of 
the dirt. Fielder's massive power was exemplified by two long home runs: 
Fielder was traded to the New York Yankees on July 31, 1996, for Rubén 
Sierra and Matt Drews. Fielder's acquisition was integral in the Yankees' 
World Series championship that year. Fielder stayed with the Yankees in 
1997, and he played for the Anaheim Angels and Cleveland Indians in 1998.[10] 
Fielder was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays before the start of the 1999 
season. Despite batting .264 in 17 spring training games, going 14-for-53 
with two doubles, a team-high three homers and 11 RBI; Toronto traded for 
Dave Hollins and Cecil was released once spring training wrapped. He subsequently 
retired. In his career, Cecil Fielder batted .255, with 319 HRs, 1008 RBI, 
and a .482 slugging average, drawing 693 walks for a .345 on-base percentage 
with 2 career stolen bases. As neither of his stolen bases came in the 
1990 season, he held the single season record for most home runs (51) without 
a single stolen base (later passed by Mark McGwire's 52 HR and 65 HR seasons). 
He was inducted in the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994. 
In October 2004, The Detroit News reported that Fielder was suffering from 
domestic and gambling problems. They relied on court documents from Fielder's 
divorce and a lawsuit brought against him by Trump Plaza Hotel and Casinos 
in New Jersey describing debts to various casinos, credit card companies 
and banks.[11] Fielder later filed a libel suit against Gannett, the parent 
company of The Detroit News, and the lead reporter, Fred Girard, accusing 
them of slander and defamation of character. The suit sought US$25 million 
in damages and fees. The trial court dismissed the suit and the Michigan 
Court of Appeals affirmed the decision.[12] Fielder's son Prince is a first 
baseman, formerly with the Milwaukee Brewers, then with the Detroit Tigers, 
and the Texas Rangers. Fielder was originally involved in his son's professional 
career, even negotiating his first contract. After a dispute as to whether 
Cecil should receive a typical agent's fee for negotiating the contract, 
Prince and his family were no longer on speaking terms with Cecil.[1] In 
a 2012 interview, Cecil Fielder said that he and Prince had recently begun 
speaking again, and that their relationship was improving.[13] On September 
25, 2007, Prince hit his 50th home run of the season, making Cecil and 
Prince the only father/son duo in Major League history to each reach the 
milestone. In December 2007, Cecil and partner Kundy Gutierrez started 
a youth baseball organization called The Baseball Legends (TBL Tournaments). 
TBL Tournaments has grown throughout the United States as one of the premiere 
youth baseball tournament organizations. TBL Tournaments is known for their 
summer national event called Cecil Fielder Elite World Series. For more 
information on his organization, visit TBL Tournaments. After managing 
the South Coast League's Charlotte County Redfish in 2007, Fielder became 
the manager of the Atlantic City Surf of the Canadian-American Association 
of Professional Baseball in 2008. On March 25, 2011, Fielder was named
