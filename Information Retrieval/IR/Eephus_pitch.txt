An Eephus pitch (also spelled Ephus) in baseball is a very low-speed junk 
pitch.[1] The delivery from the pitcher has very low velocity and usually 
catches the hitter off-guard. Its invention is attributed to Rip Sewell 
of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1940s, although according to historians 
John Thorn and John Holway, the first pitcher to throw a big blooper pitch 
was Bill Phillips, who played in the National League on and off from 1890 
through 1903. The practice then lay dormant for nearly 40 years until Sewell 
resurrected it.[2] According to manager Frankie Frisch, the pitch was named 
by outfielder Maurice Van Robays. When asked what it meant, Van Robays 
replied, "'Eephus ain't nothing, and that's a nothing pitch." Although 
the origin is not known for certain, "Eephus" may come from the Hebrew 
word אפס (pronounced "EFF-ess"), meaning "nothing".[3] The Eephus pitch 
is thrown overhand like most pitches, but is characterized by an unusual, 
high arcing trajectory.[4][5] The corresponding slow velocity bears more 
resemblance to a slow-pitch softball delivery than to a traditional baseball 
pitch. It is considered a trick pitch because, in comparison to normal 
baseball pitches, which run from 70 to 100 miles per hour (110 to 160 km/h), 
an Eephus pitch appears to move in slow motion at 55 mph (89 km/h) or less, 
sometimes into the low-40s mph (66–69 km/h). Sewell's earliest recorded 
use of the pitch came in a game against the Boston Braves at Forbes Field 
in Pittsburgh on June 1, 1943,[6][7] although as early as the spring training 
season of 1942 Sewell may have been experimenting with the pitch.[7] Sewell 
went on to win 20 games with the pitch in 1943.[8] After appearing in over 
300 major-league games, Rip Sewell gave up only one career home run off 
the Eephus, to Ted Williams in the 1946 All-Star Game. Williams challenged 
Sewell to throw the Eephus. Sewell obliged, and Williams fouled off the 
pitch. However, Sewell then announced that he was going to throw the pitch 
again, and Williams clobbered it for a home run.[9][10] When describing 
the mechanics of the pitch and why he was able to succeed where others 
had failed, Williams remarked "A little girl could hit that pitch, but 
you had to provide all the power yourself."[11] Years later, however, Williams 
admitted that he had been running towards the pitcher’s mound as he hit 
the ball, and photographs reveal that he was in fact a few feet in front 
of the batter’s box when he made contact.[4][12] Since under Rule 6.06(a) 
of the Official Baseball Rules, a batter is out for illegal action when 
he hits a ball with one or both feet on the ground entirely outside the 
batter's box, Williams would have been out had it been spotted by the home 
plate umpire. Bill "Spaceman" Lee threw an Eephus referred to as the "Leephus," 
"spaceball," or "moon ball."[13] Pitching for the Boston Red Sox in Game 
7 of the 1975 World Series, the Red Sox were up 3–0 when, on a 1-0 count, 
Lee threw an Eephus pitch to Tony Pérez with a runner on base.[14] The 
pitch resulted in a towering two-run home run over the Green Monster that 
Lee often said afterward "is still rising."[15] The Red Sox would go on 
to lose the game 4–3, costing them the chance for their first World Series 
championship since 1918.[3] Other pitchers known to have employed the Eephus 
pitch include: Pedro Borbón,[16] Yu Darvish,[17] Casey Fossum (called the 
Fossum Flip[18]), Steve Hamilton (the folly floater),[19] Liván Hernández, 
Phil Niekro,[20] Orlando Hernández, Dave LaRoche (LaLob), Carlos Zambrano, 
Vicente Padilla (dubbed the soap bubble by Vin Scully),[16][21] Satchel 
Paige,[22] Pascual Perez (the Pascual Pitch), Kazuhito Tadano,[23] Bob 
Tewksbury,[24] Carlos Villanueva,[25] Alfredo Simón,[26] Clayton Kershaw,[27][a] 
Rich Hill,[28] and unique wind-mill windup 1930s to 1950s pitcher Bobo 
Newsom. Other nicknames for the Eephus pitch include the balloon ball, 
blooper ball, gondola, parachute, rainbow pitch – distinct from the rainbow 
curve,[5] gravity curve, The Monty Brewster (a reference to the titular 
character in Brewster's Millions), and Bugs Bunny curve (a reference to 
the 1946 Bugs Bunny cartoon 'Baseball Bugs' in which several batters in 
a row swing three times each at a pitch before the ball reaches the plate).
