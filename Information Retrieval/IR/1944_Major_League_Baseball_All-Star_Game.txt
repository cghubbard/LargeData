The 1944 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 12th playing of the 
"Midsummer Classic" between Major League Baseball's American League (AL) 
and National League (NL) All-Star teams. The All-Star Game was held on 
July 11, 1944 at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the home of 
the NL's Pittsburgh Pirates. The game resulted in the National League defeating 
the American League 7–1.[1] Played during World War II, receipts from the 
game were distributed to a fund that provided baseball equipment to members 
of the armed services.[2] The Pirates hosted the game and were well-represented. 
Pirates pitcher Rip Sewell, infielder Bob Elliott, and outfielder Vince 
DiMaggio were selected for the National League All-Star squad. Pirates 
pitchers Max Butcher and Cookie Cuccurullo were named the NL's batting 
practice pitchers and Pirates catcher Spud Davis was the NL's batting practice 
catcher. Honus Wagner was named an honorary coach, the first time this 
honor was bestowed in Major League Baseball's All-Star Game.[3] Players 
in italics have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of 
Fame. The umpires changed assignments in the middle of the fifth inning 
– Barr and Hubbard swapped positions, also Berry and Sears swapped positions.[4] 
The American League scored a run in the second inning on a single by Hank 
Borowy, its pitcher, but never scored again. The National League got four 
runs in the fifth inning, led by Bill Nicholson's pinch-hit double. Whitey 
Kurowski knocked in two more runs with a double in the seventh. A sacrifice 
fly by Stan Musial in the eighth inning closed out the scoring. Ken Raffensberger
