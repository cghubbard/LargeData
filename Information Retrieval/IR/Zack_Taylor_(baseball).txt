As player As manager James Wren "Zack" Taylor (July 27, 1898 – September 
19, 1974) was an American professional baseball player, coach, scout and 
manager.[1] He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher with the Brooklyn 
Robins, Boston Braves, New York Giants, Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees, 
and again with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Although Taylor was not a powerful 
hitter, he sustained a lengthy career in the major leagues due to his valuable 
defensive abilities as a catcher. After his playing career, he became better 
known as the manager for the St. Louis Browns owned by Bill Veeck.[2] His 
baseball career spanned 58 years.[2] A native of Yulee, Florida, Taylor 
began his professional baseball career at the age of 16 with the Valdosta 
Millionaires during the 1915 season.[3] After playing in the minor leagues 
for five seasons, he made his major league debut with the Brooklyn Robins 
on June 15, 1920 at the age of 21.[1] He became the Robins' main catcher 
in 1923, succeeding Hank DeBerry. Although he led National League catchers 
in errors and in passed balls, he also led in range factor, assists and 
baserunners caught stealing while batting .288 in 93 games.[1][4] In 1924, 
his batting average improved to .290 and he led the league's catchers in 
range factor and fielding percentage.[1] Taylor had his best offensive 
season in 1925, posting career highs with a .310 batting average, 3 home 
runs and 44 runs batted in.[1] He developed a reputation as one of the 
best catchers in the National League, finishing the season with 102 assists 
and leading the league's catchers with 64 baserunners caught stealing.[5][6] 
He had a talent for catching the spitball, and became the personal catcher 
for future Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Burleigh Grimes, the last pitcher 
allowed to throw the spitball in the major leagues.[7] On October 6, 1925, 
Taylor was traded by the Robins with Eddie Brown and Jimmy Johnston to 
the Boston Braves for Jesse Barnes, Gus Felix and Mickey O'Neil.[6] After 
a season and a half with the Braves, he was traded to John McGraw's New 
York Giants along with Larry Benton and Herb Thomas for Doc Farrell, Kent 
Greenfield and Hugh McQuillan.[8] The Giants had acquired Burleigh Grimes 
in another trade and wanted Taylor to be his personal catcher.[7] Despite 
catching Grimes' team-leading 19 wins and performing well defensively to 
help the Giants finish the season just two games behind the pennant-winning 
Pittsburgh Pirates, McGraw released Taylor back to the Braves for the waiver 
price of $4,000 on February 28, 1928, the same day Grimes was traded to 
Pittsburgh.[9][10] McGraw said he regretted releasing the 29-year-old Taylor, 
but that he wanted to give younger catchers such as Shanty Hogan a chance 
to play.[10] Taylor took over as the Braves' starting catcher for the 1928 
season.[11] Having been displaced by Al Spohrer as the Braves' starting 
catcher early in the 1929 season, Taylor's contract was sold to the Chicago 
Cubs for the waiver price of $7,500 in July after all the other teams in 
both the American and National Leagues had passed on him.[12][13] When 
the Cubs' future Hall of Fame catcher Gabby Hartnett suffered an arm injury 
early in 1929, Taylor filled in capably, helping the Cubs win the National 
League pennant.[13] He helped guide the Cubs' pitching staff to a league-leading 
14 shutouts and finish second in team earned run average and strikeouts.[14][15] 
In the only postseason appearance of his career in the 1929 World Series 
against the Philadelphia Athletics, Taylor made only three hits but was 
cited as an unsung hero in a losing cause for the Cubs because of his consistent, 
unwavering defensive skills behind the plate.[16][17] When Hartnett returned 
from his injury in 1930, Taylor went back to being the Cubs' backup catcher. 
In 1932, Cub manager Rogers Hornsby credited Taylor with helping develop 
the skills of Lon Warneke, as the young pitcher led the league with 22 
wins.[18][19] After being released by the Cubs in November 1933, he appeared 
in four games for the Yankees in 1934 before ending his playing career 
as a player-coach with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1935.[1] He played his final 
major league game on September 24, 1935 at the age of 36,[1] and returned 
to the minor leagues as player-manager for the San Antonio Missions from 
1937 to 1939 and the Toledo Mud Hens from 1940 to 1941.[20] In a sixteen-year 
major league career, Taylor played in 918 games, accumulating 748 hits 
in 2,865 at bats for a .261 career batting average, along with 9 home runs, 
311 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .304.[1] He ended his career 
with a .977 fielding percentage.[1] Taylor led National League catchers 
three times in range factor and in baserunners caught stealing, twice in 
assists and once in fielding percentage.[1] His 49.63% career caught stealing 
percentage ranks 19th all-time among major league catchers.[21] Taylor 
joined the St. Louis Browns as a coach in the midseason of 1941, and was 
a member of the 1944 Browns team that won the American League pennant – 
the team's only championship in its 52 years in St. Louis, although they 
eventually lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1944 World Series.[22] 
When Luke Sewell resigned as manager in 1946, Taylor took over as the interim 
manager,[23] finished the season, then joined the coaching staff of the 
1947 Pittsburgh Pirates. After Muddy Ruel managed the Browns to a last-place, 
59–95 record in 1947 campaign, St. Louis general manager Bill DeWitt re-hired 
Taylor to be the manager. He lost 100 games in two of his five seasons 
as the manager of the under-funded Browns, and was fired after the 1951 
season.[23] Taylor was the St. Louis manager who, upon orders from then-owner 
Bill Veeck, called on Eddie Gaedel to pinch hit during a game on August 
19, 1951 against Bob Cain and the Detroit Tigers.[2][24] He also participated 
in another Veeck stunt, in which the Browns handed out placards – reading 
take, swing, bunt, etc. – to fans and allowed them to make managerial decisions 
for a day. Taylor dutifully surveyed the fans' advice and relayed the sign 
accordingly.[25] The Browns won the game. Taylor remained active in baseball 
as a scout for the Chicago White Sox and the Milwaukee and Atlanta Braves 
until his death.[2][26] In 1974, Taylor was inducted into the Florida Sports 
Hall of Fame.[27] He died from a heart attack while at his home near Orlando,
