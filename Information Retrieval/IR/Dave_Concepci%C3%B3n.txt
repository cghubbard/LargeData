David Ismael "Dave" Concepción Benitez (born June 17, 1948), is a former 
shortstop in Major League Baseball. He played with the Cincinnati Reds 
for nineteen years (1970–1988) including their back-to-back World Series 
championship seasons in 1975 and 1976. The Reds later retired jersey number 
13 in honor of Concepción's contributions to the team.[1] Concepción was 
born in Ocumare de la Costa, Aragua State, Venezuela, the son of a truck 
driver[2] and his wife, Ernestina.[3] He attended Agustin Codazzi High 
School. After high school, he worked as a bank teller[4] and played part-time 
for the local Tigres de Aragua baseball team. His coach, Wilfredo Calviño, 
was also a Cincinnati Reds' scout, and Calviño signed Concepción to a Reds' 
contract in 1967.[2] Following the steps of his childhood heroes Chico 
Carrasquel and Luis Aparicio, Jr., Concepción, originally drafted as a 
pitcher, came out of Venezuela to become one of the Reds' and the National 
League's greatest all-time shortstops. He made his big-league debut on 
April 6, 1970, starting at shortstop and going 0-for-4 as the Reds defeated 
the Montreal Expos, 5-1.[5] He went 0-for-4 again the next day against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers before getting his first hit on April 8, a seventh-inning 
double off Dodgers pitcher (and future Reds teammate) Fred Norman.[6] In 
his first three seasons, Reds manager Sparky Anderson played him part-time, 
sharing duties with Woody Woodward and Darrel Chaney. In one of those appearances, 
in 1971, he was the only team member to reach base safely when the Reds 
were no-hit by the Philadelphia Phillies' Rick Wise; a sixth-inning walk 
spoiled what would have been a perfect game. In 1973, Concepción blossomed, 
both at bat and in the field, being named the starting shortstop. On May 
9, in a Reds 9–7 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, Johnny Bench hit 
three home runs and drove in seven runs against pitcher Steve Carlton. 
It was the second time that Bench smashed three homers against Carlton 
in a game. However, a Concepción two-run tie-breaker homer in the ninth, 
off Barry Lersch, was the game-winner. Concepción had been named to the 
NL All-Star team, but on July 22, two days before the game he dislocated 
his knee and broke his leg(sliding into third base after moving from first 
base with Denis Menke base hit against the Expos in the bottom of the seventh 
inning at Riverfront, fracturing the fibula of left leg) and missed the 
second half of the year. At this time, he was batting .287, with 8 HRs, 
46 RBI, 39 runs, 18 doubles, three triples and 22 stolen bases. Concepción 
returned in 1974 and played 160 games. He enjoyed his best overall season, 
batting .281, with 14 HR and 82 RBI, as well as winning his first of five 
Gold Glove Awards. By 1975, Concepción joined Pete Rose, Johnny Bench, 
Joe Morgan, Tony Pérez, Ken Griffey, Sr., George Foster and César Gerónimo 
in the famous "Great Eight" starting lineup of The Big Red Machine that 
would help the Reds win the next two World Series titles. Even after Concepción 
had established himself in the major leagues as a star shortstop, he continued 
to play winter ball in Venezuela, helping to improve his batting. After 
his .274, 5, 49 totals in the 1975 Major League season, Concepción posted 
marks of: .281, 9, 69 (1976); .271, 8, 64 (1977); .301, 6, 67 (1978); .281, 
16, 84 (1979); .260, 5, 77 (1980); .306, 5, 67 (1981); and .287, 5, 53 
(1982). On July 13, 1982, the first All-Star Game outside of the United 
States was held at Montreal's Olympic Stadium. Concepción hit a two-run 
homer to help the National League to a 4–1 win (the NL's 11th straight 
victory and 19th in the last 20 contests). Concepción was named the game's 
Most Valuable Player. Later in his career, Concepción worked with Tony 
Pérez and perfected the one-bounce throw to first base. Concepción was 
the first shortstop to use this method to take advantage of the smooth 
artificial turf at Riverfront Stadium and other parks in the National League. 
Hampered by age, an elbow injury and shoulder surgery in 1982, Concepción 
had consecutive sub-par seasons from 1983–84. Grooming Barry Larkin as 
his successor, he became a dependable handyman at all four infield positions. 
He was replaced by Larkin in 1986, only 44 games away from Larry Bowa's 
NL record for shortstops. In 1988, which would be his 19th and final season 
with the Reds, manager Pete Rose sent Concepción in to pitch 1.1 innings 
in Dodger Stadium late in a blow-out game. He gave up two hits, no runs, 
and struck out one batter. The Reds released Concepción after the 1988 
season. He attempted a 20th Major League season in 1989, trying out for 
the California Angels,[7] but he failed to make the roster and retired 
from playing.[2] After retiring in 1989, he served as manager of the Tigres 
de Aragua team in Venezuela. Concepción resides with his wife, Delia, in 
Urbanizacion El Castaño, a community in Maracay, Venezuela[8] at the base 
of the mountains near Henri Pittier National Park. They have three grown 
children, sons David Alejandro and David Eduardo, and daughter Daneska.[2] 
Concepción owns a farm as well as a trucking business.[3] On August 25, 
2007, the Cincinnati Reds held a pre-game ceremony to retire Concepción's 
number 13. Joining him were several other all-time Reds greats whose numbers 
were retired, including former teammates Tony Pérez, Johnny Bench, Joe 
Morgan and manager Sparky Anderson as well as former teammates Ken Griffey 
and George Foster. Concepción has said that he originally chose that number 
to honor his mother, Ernestina, who was born in 1913.[9] It was the first 
occasion in Major League history that the number 13 was retired by a team. 
His number 13 was also retired by the Venezuelan team for which he played 
20 years of winter ball, Tigres de Aragua of Maracay.[3] In 2014, he was 
named vice president of the club.[8] He is a member of the Caribbean Series 
Hall of Fame.[3] In 2014, Concepción returned to Cincinnati to serve as 
grand marshal of the annual opening day Findlay Market Parade, and later 
he and his successor at shortstop for the Reds, Barry Larkin, threw the
