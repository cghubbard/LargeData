The Akron Black Tyrites were a Negro league baseball team that played out 
another team's schedule for a portion of a single season. They were based 
in Akron, Ohio, and were a member team of the Negro National League (II). 
The Columbus Blue Birds finished last in the first half of the 1933 season, 
were disbanded and ended up merging with the Tyrites, one of the top independent 
Negro league teams of their day.[2] The Tyrites then more or less became 
the Cleveland Giants, which finished out Columbus's schedule for the season.
