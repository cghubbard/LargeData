Joshua Adam Donaldson (born December 8, 1985) is an American professional 
baseball third baseman for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He was initially drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 2007 MLB Draft 
after playing for Auburn University during his time in college. Donaldson 
has also played for the Oakland Athletics, making his debut for the team 
in 2010, progressing with the team and eventually becoming an All-Star 
in the 2014 MLB season. After being traded to the Toronto Blue Jays, Donaldson 
was voted the American League Most Valuable Player for the 2015 MLB season, 
the first Blue Jays player to be named MVP since George Bell won the award 
in 1987, and was named as a starter to the 2015 MLB All-Star Game, earning 
the most fan votes obtained by a player in the process. Donaldson also 
won the Silver Slugger Award and led the American League in RBIs (runs 
batted in) and runs scored. Born in Pensacola, Florida, Donaldson attended 
Pace High School in Pace, Florida for his sophomore year and played varsity 
baseball, before moving and being transferred by his mother, Lisa, to Faith 
Academy in Mobile, Alabama. Josh was being consistently taunted by his 
teammates, and Lisa also wanted Josh to have his friend, P.J. Walters, 
to be with him at the Academy.[1] At Faith, Donaldson competed in football, 
basketball, and baseball. As a shortstop and pitcher, Donaldson was the 
Alabama Gatorade Player of the Year as a senior, batting .515 on the season, 
and led Faith Academy to a state title. Donaldson set four Faith Academy 
single-season records in baseball, hits (55), triples (6), doubles (21), 
and RBIs (54). In football, Donaldson was a wide receiver, defensive back, 
and punter, setting a school record with 11 interceptions in one season 
as a senior.[2] Donaldson later attended Auburn University, where he played 
college baseball as a catcher and third baseman for the Auburn Tigers baseball 
team in the Southeastern Conference. During his freshman season in 2005, 
Donaldson started 39 games at third base, hitting .294 with seven home 
runs, and also began learning to play catcher. In his sophomore season, 
Donaldson hit .276 and led the team with ten home runs; he also threw out 
15 of 38 base stealers and had seven pickoffs. In the summer of 2006, Donaldson 
played for the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League where he 
was an All-Star and hit .302. In 2007, Donaldson was named a Louisville 
Slugger Preseason All-American.[3] The Chicago Cubs drafted Donaldson as 
a catcher in the first round (48th overall) of the 2007 MLB Draft.[4] In 
his first minor league season Donaldson played 53 games for the Rookie 
Arizona League Cubs and Short Season-A Boise Hawks, batting a combined 
.335 with nine home runs and 25 RBIs. He also walked more than he struck 
out, with 39 and 38 respectively.[4] In 2008, he played 63 games with the 
Class-A Peoria Chiefs, where he hit .217 with six home runs and 23 RBIs.[4] 
Donaldson was then traded, along with Matt Murton, Eric Patterson and Sean 
Gallagher, to the Oakland Athletics for Rich Harden and Chad Gaudin.[5] 
He played 47 games with the Advanced-A Stockton Ports, where he batted 
.330 and had nine home runs and 39 RBIs.[4] Donaldson then played the entire 
2009 season with the Double-A Midland RockHounds, and recorded a batting 
average of .270 with nine home runs and 91 RBIs.[4] Donaldson was called 
up to the majors for the first time on April 30, 2010, filling in for the 
injured Kurt Suzuki.[6] He made his debut that night as a pinch hitter, 
and struck out. The next day, he recorded his first major league hit, a 
two-run home run on the first pitch by Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Dana Eveland.[7] 
In 14 games played during the 2010 season, Donaldson made 34 plate appearances 
and recorded five hits. [8] After returning to the minor leagues, he spent 
the season with the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats and hit .238 with 18 
home runs and 67 RBIs for the season.[4] Donaldson played the entire 2011 
season in Sacramento, improving his average to .261, and hit 17 home runs 
and 70 RBIs.[4] Donaldson officially converted to third base from catching 
in the beginning of the 2012 season during spring training. He started 
the regular season as the everyday third baseman for the A's for the first 
half, but due to struggles he was sent to the Triple-A Sacramento River 
Cats for much of the season. The A's recalled him in mid August after everyday 
third baseman Brandon Inge was placed on the 15-day disabled list with 
an injured arm.[9] Donaldson helped the A's into making the postseason, 
and finished the 2012 season with nine home runs, 33 RBIs and a .241 average.[8] 
Against Detroit Tigers reliever Brayan Villarreal, Donaldson hit his first 
career walk-off home run on April 12, 2013. It was the A's first walk-off 
win in 2013. He hit his first career grand slam on June 7 against Chicago 
White Sox starter Chris Sale.[10] Major League Baseball named Donaldson 
the American League Player of the Month for September after batting .337 
with 20 runs scored, eight doubles, five home runs and 16 RBIs in 25 games.[11] 
He played 158 games and finished the season with 24 home runs, 93 RBIs 
and a .301 average and placed fourth in AL MVP voting.[10] Donaldson was 
elected to his first All-Star appearance in 2014 as the starter at third 
base for the American League.[12] Donaldson hit a three-run walk-off home 
run in the ninth inning against the Baltimore Orioles on July 17 to lead 
the A's to a 5–4 victory. Donaldson won his first career Fielding Bible 
Award for his work at third base.[13] During the 2014 season, Donaldson 
hit 98 RBIs, 29 home runs, and 93 runs scored, beating out his career highs 
with Oakland. However, Donaldson's batting average went down to .255. [8] 
Donaldson would end up finishing 8th in the AL MVP voting. [14] On November 
28, 2014, the Athletics traded Donaldson to the Toronto Blue Jays for Brett 
Lawrie, Kendall Graveman, Sean Nolin, and Franklin Barreto.[15] The following 
February, he lost his salary arbitration case against the Blue Jays after 
seeking $5.75 million. Instead, he was awarded the Blue Jays' offer of 
$4.3 million for the 2015 season.[16] On June 1, Donaldson was named the 
American League Player of the Week for the second time in his career. From 
May 25–31, he batted .440 with 11 runs scored, six home runs, and 11 RBIs.[17] 
A campaign was launched in early June to elect Donaldson as a starter to 
the 2015 MLB All-Star Game, which was led by Don Cherry and Stephen Amell.[18][19] 
At the time the campaign began, Mike Moustakas of the Kansas City Royals 
led voting for third basemen. It was announced in a voting update on June 
29 that Donaldson had surpassed Moustakas,[20] and on July 5, was announced 
as the starting third baseman for the All-Star game, with a record 14,090,188 
votes.[21][22] He participated in the Home Run Derby on July 13, losing 
in the semi-finals to eventual winner Todd Frazier.[23] From August 3–9, 
he batted .385 (10 hits in 26 at bats) with two doubles, five home runs, 
eight RBIs and nine runs scored as the Blue Jays won eight games in a row. 
This performance led to his second AL Player of the Week Award of the season.[24] 
By the end of August, observers began referring to Donaldson's season as 
one of the best in Blue Jays' history.[25] Several members of the media 
wrote articles naming him as the American League Most Valuable Player Award 
frontrunner over Mike Trout, and fans attending both home and away games 
began chanting "M-V-P! M-V-P!" when he would bat.[26][27][28] On September 
7, Donaldson hit his 100th career home run. He hit his 40th home run of 
the season on September 25, and in doing joined Shawn Green and Carlos 
Delgado as the only players in franchise history to have 40 doubles and 
40 home runs in the same season.[29] Donaldson finished the 2015 regular 
season with a .297 batting average, 122 runs scored, 41 doubles, 41 home 
runs, and 123 RBIs.[30] According to Baseball-Reference.com, his 8.8 Wins 
Above Replacement (WAR) in 2015 ranked as the highest single-season total 
in club history, surpassing José Bautista's previous record of 8.1 in 2011.[31] 
Sporting News announced on October 29, 2015, that Donaldson had won their 
MLB Player of the Year Award.[32] Other awards included the American League 
Hank Aaron Award,[33] the American League third baseman's Silver Slugger 
Award,[34] and Players Choice Awards for both Major League Player of the 
Year and American League Outstanding Player.[35] On November 19, 2015, 
Donaldson was named the 2015 American League Most Valuable Player (AL MVP),[36] 
finishing ahead of Mike Trout and Lorenzo Cain. On December 5, 2015, Donaldson 
was revealed as the cover athlete for MLB The Show 16.[37] In February 
2016, Donaldson and the Blue Jays appeared to be heading to salary arbitration 
for the second consecutive year. Donaldson had asked for $11.8 million 
for the 2016 season, while the Blue Jays had countered at $11.35 million. 
On February 10, Donaldson signed a two-year, $28.65 million extension that 
will pay him $11.65 million in 2016, and $17 million in 2017.[38] In the 
first half of 2016, Donaldson resumed the high level of play from his MVP 
season. He won the June 19 Player of the Week Award after hitting three 
home runs, four doubles, one triple and nine runs driven in with 12 hits 
in 27 at bats. He led the league in total bases (27), extra-base hits (8) 
and tied for first in slugging percentage (1.000).[39] On July 7, he was 
announced as a reserve for the American League in the 2016 All-Star Game.[40] 
Heading into the All-Star break, Donaldson was batting .304 with 23 home 
runs and 63 RBIs. He had also scored 80 runs, which made him the first 
player in Blue Jays history to do so before the All-Star break.[41] On 
August 28, Donaldson hit three home runs in a game for the first time in 
his career, leading the Blue Jays to a 9–6 win and a sweep of the Minnesota 
Twins.[42] Despite struggling with a hip injury late in the season,[43] 
Donaldson played very well in the Jays' division series with the Texas 
Rangers, the second consecutive season Toronto faced Texas in the playoffs. 
In the three game sweep, he hit for a .500 batting average, five doubles, 
.526 on-base percentage, .778 slugging percentage, four runs scored and 
three RBI.[44] He also scored the series-winning run in the tenth inning 
in dramatic fashion, scampering home from second base on a heads-up base 
running play following a throwing error by Rangers' second baseman Rougned 
Odor.[45] Donaldson was awarded his second consecutive Silver Slugger Award 
on November 10.[46] Donaldson was raised by his mother, Lisa French, with 
his father, Levon Donaldson, having been imprisoned for most of his childhood.[48] 
His father, a construction worker, was sentenced in 1992 on charges of 
sexual battery, false imprisonment, and aggravated battery, and released 
from prison in 2007.[49][50] His father watched him play baseball in person 
for the first time on September 13, 2013, against the Texas Rangers in 
Arlington, Texas. Donaldson walked twice and hit a home run as well as 
a double in three at-bats as the Athletics won, 9–8.[51][52][53] Aside 
from playing baseball, Donaldson has also been a lifelong avid golfer. 
When he was 18 months old, Donaldson appeared on a local TV station showing 
off a "picture perfect" golf swing.[54] He appeared on Golf Channel during 
the 2014 season and hit a ball an estimated 309 yards in a simulator. He 
found out he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays while watching the Golf 
Channel, as well as playing Mortal Kombat.[55] As of May 2013, Donaldson 
is in a relationship with Jillian Rose.[56] Donaldson is a fan of the History 
channel series Vikings, and in January 2016, it was announced that he would
