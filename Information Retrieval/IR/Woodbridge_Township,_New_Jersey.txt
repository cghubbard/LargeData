from the 93,086 counted in the 1990 Census.[26] Woodbridge was the sixth-most-populous 
municipality in New Jersey in 2010, the same ranking it held a decade earlier.[27] 
According to Joshua Coffin, the early settlers included "Captain John Pike, 
the ancestor of General Zebulon Montgomery Pike, who was killed at the 
battle of Queenstown in 1813; Thomas Bloomfield, the ancestor of Joseph 
Bloomfield, some years governor of New Jersey, for whom the township of 
Bloomfield, New Jersey is named; John Bishop, senior and junior; Jonathan 
Haynes; Henry Jaques; George March; Stephen Kent; Abraham Toppan, junior; 
Elisha Ilsley; Hugh March; John Bloomfield; Samuel Moore; Nathaniel Webster; 
John Ilsley; and others."[28] Woodbridge was the site of the first gristmill 
in New Jersey.[29][30] The mill was built by Jonathan Singletary Dunham 
(married to Mary Bloomfield, relative of Joseph Bloomfield).[31][32] The 
Township of Woodbridge is the oldest original township in New Jersey and 
was granted a royal charter on June 1, 1669, by King Charles II of England.[33] 
It was reincorporated on October 31, 1693. Woodbridge Township was incorporated 
by the Township Act of 1798 of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 
1798, as part of the initial group of 104 townships incorporated in the 
state under the Township Act. Portions of the township were taken to form 
Rahway (April 19, 1858), Raritan Township (March 17, 1870, now Edison Township) 
and Roosevelt (April 11, 1906, now Carteret).[34][35] The township is named 
after Reverend John W. Woodbridge (1613–1691) of Newbury, Massachusetts, 
who settled in the future township in 1664.[33][36] According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 24.507 square miles 
(63.473 km2), including 23.213 square miles (60.122 km2) of land and 1.294

Linden and Rahway in Union County, and the Borough of Staten Island in 
New York City.[38] Area codes 732 and 848 are used in Woodbridge.[24] Many 
distinct communities exist within Woodbridge Township. Several of these
