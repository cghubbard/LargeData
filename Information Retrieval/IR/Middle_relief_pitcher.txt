In baseball, middle relief pitchers (or "middle relievers") are relief 
pitchers who commonly pitch in the fifth, sixth, or seventh innings.[1] 
In the National League, a middle reliever often comes in after the starting 
pitcher has been pulled for a pinch hitter. A middle reliever is usually 
replaced in the eighth or ninth innings by a left-handed specialist, setup 
pitcher or closers; middle relief pitchers may work these innings as well,
