This is a list of Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise postseason and 
World Series streaks. The list includes only the modern World Series between 
the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), not the various 
19th-century championship series. The most successful postseason team in 
MLB history is the New York Yankees, who have achieved three of the four 
instances of a franchise winning more than two World Series championships 
in a row (one streak each of durations 3, 4, and 5 seasons) and five of 
the six instances of a franchise winning the league pennant (i.e., an appearance 
in the World Series) more than three times in a row (three streaks of 4 
seasons and two streaks of 5 seasons). The only other franchises to achieve 
these milestones are the Oakland Athletics, who won three consecutive championships 
from 1972 to 1974, and the New York Giants, who won four consecutive pennants 
from 1921 to 1924. The Yankees also achieved a remarkable run of appearing 
in 15 of the 18 World Series from 1947 to 1964. Beginning in 1969, MLB 
split into four divisions, and the winners of each competed in the League 
Championship Series, with the winners advancing to the World Series. When 
a multi-tier playoff system was implemented in 1995, the LCS remained the 
series that determined the pennant-winner. The longest streak of consecutive 
LCS appearances belongs to the Atlanta Braves with 8 in a row from 1991 
to 1999 (not counting 1994, when there were no playoffs), while the second-longest 
belongs to the Oakland Athletics with 5 in a row from 1971 to 1975. Further 
expansion of the postseason began in 1995, with eight teams entering the 
playoffs each year (further expanded to ten teams in 2012). In this era, 
the Braves entered the postseason 14 consecutive years from 1991 to 2005 
(again not counting 1994), while the Yankees had a streak of 13 appearances 
from 1995 to 2007. However, all other postseason appearance streaks of 
5 years or more predate the expanded-postseason era and are mentioned above, 
except for 5-year runs by the Cleveland Indians (1995–1999), the Philadelphia 
Phillies (2007–2011), and the St. Louis Cardinals (2011–2015). Near streaks: 
Runs during which a franchise won World Series championships at least 70% 
of the time, with gaps of no more than one year: Near streaks: Runs during 
which a franchise won its league pennant at least 70% of the time, with
