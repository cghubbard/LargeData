Craig Andrew Breslow (pronounced BREHZ-loh; born August 8, 1980) is an 
American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He previously 
played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres, Cleveland 
Indians, Minnesota Twins, Oakland Athletics, Arizona Diamondbacks, Boston 
Red Sox, and Miami Marlins. As a senior at Yale University, where he majored 
in molecular biophysics and biochemistry, he led the Ivy League with a 
2.56 ERA. He was drafted in the 26th round by the Milwaukee Brewers in 
2002, and debuted in the Major Leagues with the San Diego Padres in 2005. 
Through 2013, he held major league batters to a .217 batting average with 
runners in scoring position (and .204 with two outs and runners in scoring 
position). While he was long considered a lefty specialist, he has been 
successful against right-handed hitters as well.[1][2] Through 2013, lefties 
hit only .230 against him (while righties hit .222), with a .354 slugging 
percentage (.331 for righties).[3][4] He was second in the American League 
in appearances by a pitcher in both 2009 (77 games) and 2010 (75 games). 
Breslow was given the nickname "smartest man in baseball" by Minneapolis 
Star Tribune Twins beat writer La Velle E. Neal III, and Wall Street Journal 
reporter Jason Turbow wrote: "Judging by his résumé, Craig Breslow is the 
smartest man in baseball, if not the entire world."[5][6][7][8] The Sporting 
News named him the smartest athlete on their top-20 list, in 2010.[9] He 
stands 6'1" and weighs 185 lbs. Breslow is Jewish, and attended Hebrew 
school. His family attended Congregation B'nai Israel in Bridgeport, Connecticut, 
where he had his bar mitzvah in 1993.[10][11][12][13] He has fasted while 
pitching on Yom Kippur, and noted: "Being Jewish is more difficult in baseball 
... but I try to do what I can in terms of paying attention to holidays."[11] 
Breslow's father Abe Breslow is a teacher and the former department chair 
in Physical Education and Health, and boys tennis coach and girls soccer 
coach, at Trumbull High School.[14][15] His mother, Ann Breslow, is a math 
teacher in Bridgeport.[11][16][17][18] In 1992 when he was 12 years old, 
his sister Lesley—two years older—was diagnosed with pediatric thyroid 
cancer, for which she had surgery to remove all of her thyroid gland (a 
thyroidectomy).[19][20][21][22] "Something as traumatic as that has a lasting 
impact," Breslow said. "It confirmed my interest [in medicine]. Being a 
doctor went from being a prestigious profession to something that changes 
people's lives."[20] The experience led Breslow to take an interest in 
molecular biophysics and biochemistry. Later in life, Breslow formed a 
non-profit foundation to help children with cancer.[20][22][23][24][25] 
Breslow attended Trumbull High School in Trumbull, Connecticut, graduating 
in 1998.[26] He was a standout in baseball and soccer, and served as team 
captain in both sports during his senior year. In baseball, he was the 
winning pitcher in the Class LL State Baseball championship game, playing 
with teammate and future Arizona Diamondbacks 2nd round draft pick, Jamie 
D'Antona.[27] As a senior in high school, Breslow played in the Connecticut/Massachusetts 
All-Star game at Fenway Park. He was named to the 1998 New Haven Register 
All-Area team.[28] In soccer, he helped lead Trumbull High to their first-ever 
state tournament victory. In 1997, he was named to the Fairfield County 
Interscholastic Athletic Conference Boys First-Team Soccer Team.[29] He 
was known for having an uncanny ability to score from very difficult and 
wide angles, and ranks among the school's all-time scorers. Scholastically 
he excelled as well, scoring 1420 on his SAT exam.[30] Breslow was captain 
of the Yale Bulldogs baseball team in the Ivy League.[31] As a freshman 
in 1999, he pitched for the Middletown Giants of the New England Collegiate 
Baseball League; in November 2013 he was inducted into the NECBL's Hall 
of Fame.[32] As a junior, he led Yale in victories (3) and ERA (2.61; 3rd 
in the Ivy League), striking out 66 batters in 51⅔ innings (ranking 13th 
in the nation in strikeouts per nine innings). He earned All-Ivy honors 
that season, which included a 16-strikeout performance vs. Cornell, and 
a one-hit shutout at Harvard. As a senior, he led the Ivy League with a 
2.56 ERA.[33] In 2002, Breslow was named a Jewish Sports Review College 
Baseball First Team All-American, along with future major leaguers Sam 
Fuld and Adam Greenberg.[34] He graduated in 2002 with a B.A. in molecular 
biophysics and biochemistry.[20][35][36][37][38] He was drafted in the 
26th round by the Milwaukee Brewers in 2002.[39] Breslow deferred acceptance 
to the New York University School of Medicine because of his "love of the 
game".[11] Breslow reached the Major Leagues in 2005, the first Yale graduate 
to do so since Ron Darling (1983–95). He pitched his first game for San 
Diego on July 23, 2005.[31][40][41] Breslow was also one of six Ivy Leaguers 
on major league rosters at the beginning of the 2009 season.[42] In 2012, 
Breslow and catcher Ryan Lavarnway became the first Yale grads to be Major 
League teammates since 1949, and the first All-Yale battery in the major 
leagues since 1883.[43] In 2002, Breslow ranked fifth in the Pioneer League 
with six wins, going 6–2 with a 1.82 ERA (54⅓ IP) in 23 appearances out 
of the pen for the Rookie-level Ogden Raptors. He struck out 56 in 54⅓ 
innings, and limited the opposition to a .218 average.[44] In 2003, he 
averaged 11⅓ strikeouts per nine innings for the Single-A Beloit Snappers, 
fanning 80 batters in 65 innings.[44] In 2004, Breslow played 79 games 
in the Brewers system, reaching the Class A California League High Desert 
Mavericks. The Brewers released Breslow during the 2004 season.[44] He 
then took the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) and scored a 34 (the 
average score for medical school applicants was 28), and applied to NYU 
Medical School.[30] But though the medical school accepted him, they would 
only let him start if he agreed to stop playing baseball.[20][30] "I wasn't 
ready to give it up", he said. "I thought I could still get guys out."[20] 
As of 2013, he was undecided as to whether after his baseball career ends 
he will attend medical school, or alternatively become involved in the 
operational side of baseball.[45] Breslow completed the 2004 season pitching 
for the New Jersey Jackals of the Northeast League, an independent baseball 
league. He held batters to a .204 average and recorded 37 strikeouts in 
26⅓ innings, an average of 12.6 strikeouts per nine innings.[46] Signed 
by the San Diego Padres in 2005 for $1 out of a tryout camp, he excelled, 
getting $1,500 after making the Double-A Southern League Mobile BayBears, 
allowing a .212 average in 52 innings over 40 outings while striking out 
47 and walking 17 with a 2.75 ERA.[47] He earned his first big league callup 
on July 23, 2005. He was mistaken for the team batboy during his first 
day with the Padres.[48] He became the 24th Yalie to play in Major League 
Baseball and the first to reach the major leagues since Ron Darling.[49] 
"It wasn't until I was playing baseball in the big leagues that I thought 
I could play baseball in the big leagues", he said.[20] Breslow then split 
the rest of the season between San Diego, for whom he had a 2.20 ERA in 
14 games, and the Triple-A Pacific Coast League Portland Beavers. The Padres 
non-tendered Breslow in December 2005. He was signed by the Red Sox, as 
a minor league free agent, to a minor league contract in January 2006. 
In 2006, Breslow was named an International League (Triple-A) All-Star 
while with the Pawtucket Red Sox. In 67 innings of work for the season, 
he was 7–1 with a 2.69 ERA and struck out an average of 10.3 batters per 
nine innings. He was selected by his teammates as the PawSox Most Valuable 
Pitcher. He was promoted to Boston in the second half of the season, making 
him the fourth Jewish player (in addition to Kevin Youkilis, Gabe Kapler, 
and Adam Stern) to play for the Red Sox that year. In 12 innings with the 
Red Sox in 2006, he posted a 3.75 ERA and had 12 strikeouts. Off the field, 
he helped Red Sox pitcher Josh Beckett win a bet against catcher Doug Mirabelli. 
Breslow calculated how many times a baseball spins when it's thrown 90 
miles an hour from the pitcher's mound to home plate.[50] "Josh wanted 
to know if I could figure out how many times a baseball spins on the way 
to the plate", Breslow said. "There's a lot of variables, but I put in 
some figures and came up with answers for a fastball, curve, or slider. 
It's rather simple once you do it."[20][51] Breslow earned a trip to the 
Triple-A All-Star game in July for the second straight season for the Pawtucket 
Red Sox. At the end of June, Breslow's ERA was 1.55. But his final numbers 
for 2007 were 2–3, 4.06 ERA, 25 walks, 73 strikeouts in 68 innings. He 
was promoted to Boston on September 1, 2007, but did not make an appearance 
and was sent back to Pawtucket on September 2 to make room on the team 
roster for Jon Lester.[52] Breslow was added to the postseason roster, 
and has a ring from winning the 2007 World Series — without pitching a 
game in the majors that year.[53] On March 23, 2008, Breslow was claimed 
off outright waivers [54][55] by the Cleveland Indians and was added to 
the 40-man roster.[3][39] Breslow was out of minor league options, so the 
Indians had to keep him on their big league club out of camp, or expose 
him to waivers again.[56] Breslow won the final spot on the Indians' Opening 
Day roster.[57] "He's strong", Cleveland manager Eric Wedge said. "I want 
to be able to use him two innings. He's done that—if you look at his innings 
pitched the last couple of years versus appearances."[31] On May 23, after 
pitching in nine games, Breslow was designated for assignment.[58] "He's 
not a guy who blows you away on the radar gun. He's not a big, imposing 
guy. But he gets people out. He knows how to pitch and when to throw what. 
He figures out ways to get guys out." [59] On May 29, 2008, the Minnesota 
Twins claimed Breslow off waivers. In 42 games for the Twins Breslow had 
a 1.63 ERA, and gave up only 24 hits in 38⅔ innings. Lefties hit .183 against 
him, with a .232 slugging percentage, and in save situations batters batted 
.100 against him, with a .100 slugging percentage. He did not give up a 
run in his last 14 appearances.[19] Breslow's aggregate 2008 ERA of 1.91 
in 47 innings was ninth-best in the American League of all pitchers with 
at least 40 innings pitched, and second-best among AL lefty relievers.[60][61] 
He held all batters to a .191 batting average, a .265 on-base percentage, 
and a .299 slugging percentage.[62] Playing for the Twins in 2009, Breslow 
held left-handers to a .211 batting average and right-handers to a .226 
batting average, but battled control problems in 17 appearances.[63] The 
Twins figured they had a 50–50 chance of losing Breslow when they placed 
him on waivers in May 2009 to clear space on their 25-man roster for fellow 
left-hander Sean Henn. Oakland needed bullpen help and claimed Breslow 
before his 72-hour waiver period expired. Had he cleared, the Twins could 
have sent him to Triple-A Rochester. "We were hoping to keep him", said 
assistant general manager Rob Antony.[64] "We lost a bullpen guy without 
trying to lose a bullpen guy", manager Ron Gardenhire said. "I kind of 
got shocked when they told me."[20][65][66] Searching for an experienced 
left-hander for their bullpen, the Oakland Athletics claimed Breslow off 
waivers on May 20, 2009.[67] According to assistant general manager David 
Forst, the A's had tried to acquire him on other occasions.[68] "I'm excited 
about taking a look at him", A's Manager Bob Geren said. "He's a left-handed 
guy that's experienced. He's had some success at this level."[69] He was 
the A's key lefty out of the bullpen for the remainder of the season.[70] 
He was second in the AL in appearances in 2009, with 77.[71] Batters hit 
only .143 against him when there were runners in scoring position.[72] 
He held all batters to a .197 batting average, and a .289 on-base percentage.[62] 
He also continued to impress teammates with his intellect. "Breslow knows 
everything", A's left-hander Dallas Braden said. "I seriously want to be 
Craig Breslow when I grow up."[73] Asked in 2010 whether there was a story 
behind his jersey number, Breslow said: "When you spend time with many 
organizations over 5.5 years, you don't really care what number you get."[74] 
He was second in the AL in appearances in 2010 for the second year in a 
row, appearing in 75 games (the fifth-highest single-season total in A's 
history).[44][75] Only 7 of 33 inherited runners (21.2%) scored against 
him, third-best in the AL.[76] He held batters to a .194 batting average, 
and a .272 on-base percentage.[62] Opposing batters were 0-for-11 with 
zero RBIs against him with the bases loaded, which were the most bases-loaded 
at bats against an AL pitcher with zero RBIs since the stat was tracked 
beginning in 1974.[44] His 71 strikeouts were the most by a lefty reliever 
in Oakland history, breaking the mark of 69 set by Bob Lacey in 1977.[44][76] 
He finished with a career-high 74⅔ innings; fourth among American League 
relievers.[61][76] He was named the 2010 Most Valuable Jewish Pitcher by 
Jewish Major Leaguers, as Ryan Braun won hitter honors.[77][78] Through 
2010, he had in his career allowed only 33 of 151 (21.9%) of inherited 
runners to score, which was the fourth-best percentage among pitchers with 
150 or more inherited runners since the statistic was first tracked in 
1974.[61] In 2011, he was 0–2 with a 3.79 ERA in 67 games in which he pitched 
59.1 innings.[79] He led all relief pitchers with 5 pickoffs, and led American 
League relievers with 7 caught stealing.[44] On December 9, 2011, Breslow 
and Trevor Cahill were traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Ryan Cook, 
Jarrod Parker, and Collin Cowgill.[80] Since Breslow was the last arbitration-eligible 
player for Arizona to be under contract, he avoided arbitration and a deal 
was made at $1.795 million. His salary was a $395,000 increase over the 
2011 season.[81] In 40 games, and 43.1 innings, in 2013 for Arizona before 
being traded, he had a 2–0 record and a 2.70 ERA with 42 strikeouts, and 
limited opposing batters to a .233 batting average.[82] On July 31, 2012, 
he was traded to the Boston Red Sox for outfielder Scott Podsednik and 
relief pitcher Matt Albers.[44] In 23 innings in 2012 for the Red Sox, 
he struck out 19 and had a 2.70 ERA.[83] He held opponents to a .206 batting 
average, and opposing lefties to a .184 batting average.[84] For the season, 
he was 3–0 with a 2.70 ERA in 63 games for Arizona and Boston, and held 
left-handed hitters to a .222 batting average.[83][85] In January 2013, 
he signed a two-year contract with the Red Sox for at least $6.25 million. 
He received $2.325 million in 2013, and $3.825 million in 2014.[85] The 
Red Sox had a $4 million option for 2015, with a $100,000 buyout. He began 
the 2013 season on the disabled list with left shoulder tendinitis. After 
rehab outings with Double A Portland and Triple A Pawtucket, he was activated 
on May 7.[85] He emerged as the Red Sox' primary set-up reliever.[86] On 
September 16, Breslow was named the Red Sox nominee for the 2013 Roberto 
Clemente Award.[87] In the 2013 regular season, he was 5–2 with a 1.81 
ERA (third among left-handed relievers in the American League), in 61 games 
and 59.2 innings, and held opposing batters to a .228 batting average.[88][89][90] 
His 0.65 ERA the second half of the season was fourth-best among major 
league relievers with at least 25 innings thrown.[91] In his last 28 appearances 
of the regular season, he allowed only one run.[92] In the 2013 American 
League Division Series, he pitched 3.2 scoreless innings over 3 games, 
notching a win and allowing two hits and one walk while striking out four, 
as the Red Sox defeated Tampa Bay.[93] In the 2013 American League Championship 
Series, he added 3.1 scoreless innings against the Detroit Tigers, bringing 
his post-season total to 7 scoreless innings in 7 appearances, in which 
he held the opposition to a .130 batting average.[94][95] Breslow wrote 
a blog during the 2013 post-season.[96] During the 2013 playoffs, he pitched 
in 10 of 16 games, garnering a 2.45 ERA.[97] From 2008–13, Breslow pitched 
in more games (392) than any other left-handed reliever other than Matt 
Thornton, with a 2.82 ERA, while limiting batters to a .224 batting average.[98] 
Breslow began the 2014 season on the disabled list, not making his first 
appearance until the season's 10th game, and compiled a 5.96 ERA in 60 
appearances for the Red Sox.[97] His performance contrasted sharply with 
his 2.82 ERA over the prior six seasons.[97] The Red Sox declined his $4 
million option, buying him out for $100,000 and making him a free agent.[97] 
The Red Sox were still in a position to re-sign Breslow for less money.[97][99] 
General manager Ben Cherington said: "He has a lot of good qualities and 
we have a great relationship with him, so we'll see what happens."[97] 
On September 16, Breslow was named the Red Sox nominee for the 2014 Roberto 
Clemente Award.[100] On December 19, the Red Sox re-signed Breslow for 
one year, for $2 million.[101] During the 2015 season, Breslow was 0-4 
with a 4.15 ERA for Boston, striking out 46 and walking 23 in 65 innings.[102] 
Breslow signed a minor-league contract with the Miami Marlins on February 
12, 2016 with a major league option.[103] He was designated for assignment 
on May 11, 2016, to create room for Dustin McGowan. On July 18, Breslow 
was released by the Marlins.[104] On July 24, Breslow signed a minor league 
contract with the Texas Rangers.[105] Breslow pitched for Israel at the 
2017 World Baseball Classic during the qualifying round in September 2016.[106] 
During the opening game of the tournament, Breslow was credited with the 
win, after throwing 26 pitches over one inning, giving up 2 hits and a 
walk while recording 2 strikeouts.[107] Breslow again appeared in the final 
game of the series throwing only 2 pitches while getting one out.[108] 
Breslow's fastball ranges at 89–92 mph,[109] and he has added a cut fastball 
in the mid-80s and a sinker.[86][110] He also has a plus overhand curveball 
(70–75 mph), an average to above-average changeup, and a 78 mph slider/slurve.[37][110][111][112] 
His ability to mix up his pitches is what makes him very effective.[110] 
Breslow was nicknamed the "smartest man in baseball" by Minneapolis Star 
Tribune Twins beat writer La Velle E. Neal III, and Wall Street Journal 
reporter Jason Turbow wrote: "Judging by his résumé, Craig Breslow is the 
smartest man in baseball, if not the entire world."[5][6][7][8] In 2010 
the Sporting News named him the smartest athlete on their top-20 list.[9] 
In 2012, Men's Fitness named him one of the Top 10 Smartest Athletes in 
Professional Sports.[113] Referring to the reactions he has experienced 
to the plaudits, Breslow said: "There's no end to the teasing I’ve taken".[12] 
Red Sox manager John Farrell observed in 2013: "Breslow uses words in a 
normal conversation that I'm not used to."[114] As to the impact of his 
intelligence on his baseball performance, he admits that he analyzes video 
and looks for inefficiencies in the "kinematic system" of his delivery.[115] 
At the same time, he often subscribes to the "keep it simple, stupid" principle.[115] 
In 2008, Breslow started the Strike 3 Foundation, a non-profit charity 
that funds pediatric cancer research.[87] The organization has teamed up 
with the Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital, Connecticut Children's Medical 
Center, Conquer Cancer Foundation of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,[120] 
and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.[121][122] The foundation donated 
$500,000 to the Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital to help enhance their 
Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant Program.[45][121] It has also made gifts 
to CureSearch for Children's Cancer, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, 
Yale's Smilow Cancer Hospital, and others.[22] Breslow hopes to hold annual 
events in Connecticut and during spring training.[48] His first benefit 
raised $100,000, and his second benefit more than $85,000.[20][123] The 
charity has raised more than $1.5 million.[87] Breslow's collegiate career 
and his first year with the Brewers organization are partially discussed 
in the book Odd Man Out: A Year on the Mound with a Minor League Misfit 
by Matt McCarthy. McCarthy and Breslow were friends and teammates at Yale, 
and were on rival Pioneer League teams during the 2002 season.[124] He 
also starred in a parody of Rex Ryan's foot fetish video called "ihaveprettylefthand".[125][126][127][128][129] 
[130] Breslow invested $50,000 in a Boston-based startup company that designs 
bicycle-friendly business apparel called Ministry of Supply. The investment 
came after his fiancée bought him a shirt as a birthday present, Breslow 
took the shirt on the road and was so pleased with the performance he then 
bought two more shirts and a pair of pants. Then he decided to make the
