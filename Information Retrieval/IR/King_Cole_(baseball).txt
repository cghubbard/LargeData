Leonard Leslie "King" Cole (April 15, 1886 in Toledo, Iowa – January 6, 
1916) was a baseball player in the early 20th century. He started his baseball 
career as a pitcher with the Chicago Cubs in 1909. In 1910, he had a record 
of 20–4 and helped win a National League pennant for the Cubs. On July 
31, 1910, he became the first Cubs pitcher to throw a no-hitter, defeating 
the St. Louis Cardinals 4-0 in a seven inning game. His 20–4 record is 
the best winning percentage (.866) for a Cub pitcher in the 20th century. 
Cole was traded to Pittsburgh, and then to the New York Yankees. On October 
2, 1914, Cole gave up a double to Babe Ruth—Ruth's first hit in the major 
leagues. In 1915, Cole was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and died shortly 
after the end of the 1915 season. Ring Lardner wrote about Cole in articles 
for The Sporting News. Lardner compiled the stories into the Alibi Ike
