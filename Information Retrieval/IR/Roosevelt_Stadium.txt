Roosevelt Stadium was a baseball park at Droyer's Point in Jersey City, 
New Jersey. It opened in April 1937 and hosted high-minor league baseball, 
15 major league baseball games, plus championship boxing matches, top-name 
musical acts, an annual championship drum and bugle corps competition known 
as "The Dream", important regional high school football and even soccer 
matches. It was demolished in 1985. On June 5, 1929, Jersey City Mayor 
Frank Hague announced his plans to construct a 50,000-seat municipal stadium 
in Jersey City to surround a field 500 feet long by 400 feet wide, that 
would be dedicated to the memory of the city's war dead. It was expected 
to cost $500,000 and be built by Spring 1930. Mayor Hague planned for the 
stadium to have 35,000 permanent seats with ground space for an additional 
15,000. It would be a multi-purpose stadium for baseball, football, track 
and field events, and boxing.[1] Roosevelt Stadium was finally built in 
1937, as a Works Progress Administration project on the grounds of what 
was the Jersey City Airport at Droyer's Point. The airport was operated 
by Eddie August Schneider starting in 1935.[2][3] It was named for President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, the author of that New Deal agency. It was designed 
in Art Deco style. The ballpark's opening was scheduled for April 22, 1937 
with the opening of the 1937 International League season. Mayor Hague declared 
a half-holiday for the city's schools and employees. New York Giants owner 
Horace Stoneham was expected at the opener along with Senator Harry Moore.[4] 
Rain washed out the planned events and the opening was moved back to April 
23 with Mayor Hague throwing out the first pitch and Sen. Moore and owner 
Horace Stoneham on hand for the ballpark's dedication.[5] Initially constructed 
as a home field for Jersey City's International League affiliate of the 
New York Giants, the stadium later saw its most common use for high school 
football, as Jersey City's William L. Dickinson, James J. Ferris, Abraham 
Lincoln, Henry Snyder high schools and the city's major parochial schools, 
Hudson Catholic and St. Peter's Prep, all used the stadium, particularly 
on Thanksgiving Day, when Dickinson and St. Peter's would sell it out. 
It was the site, in September 1974, of the game that set the New Jersey 
state record for consecutive losses by a high school football team at 42, 
when Dickinson High School lost to Hudson Catholic, 22-0. The Hawks offense 
was led by quarterback Steven Neri and halfback Tony Cavallo and Dickinson 
was held to -2 yards rushing and 18 passing by a Hudson defense led by 
Steve Cuccinelli, Ray Parente and Bruce Bock. Neri, Bock, Parente and Cuccinelli 
have all been inducted into the Hudson Catholic Football program's Wall 
of Fame. Jersey City State College (now New Jersey City University) played 
their home football games on Friday nights at Roosevelt stadium during 
the 1970s. It was used for 15 "home" games by the Brooklyn Dodgers during 
their last two seasons in Brooklyn – seven in 1956 and eight in 1957.[6] 
The games were played partly as a negotiating tactic with the Borough of 
Brooklyn, in pursuit of a new stadium to replace Ebbets Field.[7] While 
it had just 24,000 seats as opposed to Ebbets Field's 31,497, Roosevelt 
Stadium had 10,000 parking spaces compared to Ebbets Field's 700. The Dodgers' 
negotiation came to naught, and the team moved to Los Angeles in 1958.[8] 
It was also the home field of the Jersey City Giants, a farm team of the 
New York Giants in the Triple-A International League from 1937 to 1950, 
the Jersey City Jerseys of the IL in 1960 and 1961, the Jersey City Indians 
of the Double-A Eastern League in 1977 and, following a change in minor-league 
affiliation, the Jersey City A's of the EL in 1978. On April 18, 1946, 
Roosevelt Stadium hosted the Jersey City Giants' season opener against 
the Montreal Royals, marking the professional debut of the Royals' Jackie 
Robinson. In his five trips to the plate, Robinson made four hits, including 
a three-run homer, scored four runs and drove in three; he also stole two 
bases in the Royals' 14-1 victory. The Giants finished first in the IL 
in 1939 and 1947, but no Jersey City team ever went on to win a pennant 
in postseason play. Hague routinely hawked opening day tickets for "Little 
Giants" games, selling 40,000 seats in a stadium that held only 24,000. 
When asked about the discrepancy, he was reported to have said "Hell of 
a crowd in the men's rooms." In 1940, former heavyweight champion Max Baer 
beat "Two Ton Tony" Galento at Roosevelt Stadium. In 1948 Marcel Cerdan 
defeated Tony Zale in a middleweight championship title fight. In 1950, 
Sugar Ray Robinson defended his welterweight title. In 1971, the stadium 
was selected to host an NASL and international soccer double-header. Bologna 
were to meet West Ham United while the New York Cosmos were to play the 
Dallas Tornado in the opener. A week later, Santos (Brazil) were scheduled 
to meet Bologna with Pelé announced. The first doubleheader was set for 
Yankee Stadium in NY but the contract that the Cosmos had with the Yankees 
allowed for a "weather clause" in which the baseball team could cancel 
if bad weather conditions posed a potential threat to the field.[9] The 
stadium saw sporadic use as a music venue during its final years of existence. 
Most notably, the Grateful Dead employed the space as their principal Metropolitan 
New York venue in the mid-1970s after the demise of the Fillmore East and 
ensuing flirtations with comparable smaller venues, ultimately performing 
at the stadium six times between 1972 and 1976. Yes, The Allman Brothers 
Band, James Brown, The Band, The Beach Boys, The Eagles, Eric Clapton, 
Pink Floyd, Tony Bennett, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Emerson, Lake & 
Palmer, and Alice Cooper also performed at the stadium. A very young Lynyrd 
Skynyrd played a blazing show in August 1975 while opening for Rod Stewart/Ten 
Years After. KISS played their very 1st "Stadium" show here on July 10, 
1976, with openers The J. Geils Band and Point Blank; the show was documented 
and released on DVD as "The Lost Concert". Each summer from 1949 through 
1980 the stadium was host to one of the most prestigious drum and bugle 
corps championships, The National Dream. During that span, over 100 of 
the country's most elite competitive drum and bugle corps met to battle 
it out on the stadium's sun-baked field vying be crowned Dream Champion. 
Famed corps such as Jersey City's own St. Patrick's Cadets, Newark's St 
Joseph's Cadets "The Hilltoppers",Blessed Sacrament Golden Knights and 
St. Lucy's Cadets, Bayonne's St. Andrew's Bridgemen, the Garfield Cadets, 
Blue Rock, and many more from around the nation met in Jersey City each 
summer. The original host corps was the St. Vincent's Cadets from Bayonne 
N.J. Many Senior corps were involved as well. The famous Hawthorne Caballeros. 
New York Skyliners, Reilly Raiders, Archer Epler, Muskateers and Lt. Norman 
Prince just to name a few. In November 1982, the Jersey City City Council 
voted to demolish the stadium.[10] It was finally demolished in 1985,[11] 
and a gated community named Droyer's Point opened on the site in 1987.
