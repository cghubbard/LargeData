The 1985 Minnesota Twins finished with a record of 77-85, fourth in the 
American League West. On June 20, after a disappointing start, manager 
Billy Gardner was replaced by Ray Miller. Minnesota, the Twins and the 
Metrodome hosted the All-Star Game. Only one Twins player made the American 
League team, outfielder Tom Brunansky. Bruno finished second in the first-ever 
Home Run Derby, behind Dave Parker. Three Minnesota natives, not yet Twins, 
played on the same major league field for the same time -- Dave Winfield, 
Jack Morris and Paul Molitor. In Anaheim on August 4, pitcher Frank Viola 
gave up a double to longtime-Twin now-an Angel Rod Carew. The two-bagger 
was Carew's 3000th career hit.[5] The pitcher on the mound on September 
25, as the Twins won their 2000th game, is the same pitcher that won Minnesota's 
1000th game on July 12, 1972 -- Bert Blyleven. 1,651,814 fans attended 
Twins games, a Twins attendance record, but still the sixth lowest total 
in the American League. Leadoff batter Kirby Puckett hit .288 and scored 
80 runs. Kent Hrbek hit .311 with 21 HR and 93 RBI. Tom Brunansky hit 27 
HR and 90 RBI. Gary Gaetti hit 20 HR and 63 RBI. For the first time in 
years, the Twins had three solid starting pitchers: Frank Viola (18-14), 
Mike Smithson (15-14), and John Butcher (11-14). Reliever Ron Davis had 
25 saves. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]
