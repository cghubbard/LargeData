De Benneville "Bert" Bell (February 25, 1895 – October 11, 1959) was the 
National Football League (NFL) commissioner from 1945 until his death in 
1959. As commissioner, he introduced competitive parity into the NFL to 
improve the league's commercial viability and promote its popularity, and 
he helped make the NFL the most financially sound sports enterprise and 
preeminent sports attraction in the United States (US). He was posthumously 
inducted into the charter class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Bell 
played football at the University of Pennsylvania, where as quarterback, 
he led his team to an appearance in the 1917 Rose Bowl. After being drafted 
into the US Army during World War I, he returned to complete his collegiate 
career at Penn and went on to become an assistant football coach with the 
Quakers in the 1920s. During the Great Depression, he was an assistant 
coach for the Temple Owls and a co-founder and co-owner of the Philadelphia 
Eagles. With the Eagles, Bell led the way in cooperating with the other 
NFL owners to establish the National Football League Draft in order to 
afford the weakest teams the first opportunity to sign the best available 
players. He subsequently became sole proprietor of the Eagles, but the 
franchise suffered financially. Eventually, he sold the team and bought 
a share in the Pittsburgh Steelers. During World War II, Bell astutely 
argued against the league suspending operations until the war's conclusion. 
After the war, he was elected NFL commissioner and sold his ownership in 
the Steelers. As commissioner, he implemented a proactive anti-gambling 
policy, negotiated a merger with the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), 
and unilaterally crafted the entire league schedule with an emphasis on 
enhancing the dramatic effect of late-season matches. During the Golden 
Age of Television, he tailored the game's rules to strengthen its appeal 
to mass media and enforced a policy of blacking out local broadcasts of 
home contests to safeguard ticket receipts. Amid criticism from franchise 
owners and under pressure from Congress, he unilaterally recognized the 
NFLPA and facilitated in the development of the first pension plan for 
the players. He survived to oversee the "Greatest Game Ever Played" and 
to envision what the league would become in the future. Bell was born de 
Benneville Bell,[1] on February 25, 1895,[2] in Philadelphia to John C. 
Bell and Fleurette de Benneville Myers.[3] His father was an attorney who 
served a term as the Pennsylvania Attorney General.[4] His older brother, 
John C., Jr., was born in 1892.[4] Bert's parents were very wealthy,[5] 
and his mother's lineage predated the American Revolutionary War.[6] His 
father, a Quaker of the University of Pennsylvania (class of 1884) during 
the early days of American football,[7] accompanied him to his first football 
game when Bell was six years old.[8] Thereafter, Bell regularly engaged 
in football games with childhood friends.[9] In 1904, Bell matriculated 
at the Episcopal Academy, the Delancey School from 1909 to 1911 and then 
the Haverford School until 1914.[9] About this time, his father was installed 
as athletics director at Penn[8] and helped form the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association (NCAA).[10] At Haverford, Bell captained the school's 
football, basketball, and baseball teams,[11] and "was awarded The Yale 
Cup [for being] 'The pupil who has done the most to promote athletics in 
the school.'"[12] Although he excelled at baseball, his devotion was to 
football.[13] His father, who was named a trustee at Penn in 1911,[14] 
said of Bell's plans for college, "Bert will go to Penn or he will go to 
hell."[10] Bell entered Penn in the fall of 1914 as an English major and 
joined Phi Kappa Sigma.[15][16] In a rare occurrence for a sophomore, he 
became the starting quarterback for Penn's coach George H. Brooke.[15] 
On the team, he also was as a defender, punter, and punt returner.[17] 
After the team's 3–0 start, Bell temporarily shared possession of his quarterbacking 
duties until he subsequently reclaimed them later in the season,[18] as 
Penn finished with a record of 3–5–2.[19] Prior to Penn's 1916 season, 
his mother died while he was en route to her bedside.[20] Nevertheless, 
he started the first game for the Quakers under new coach Bob Folwell, 
but mixed results left him platooned for the rest of the season.[20] Penn 
finished with a record of 7–2–1.[19] However, the Quakers secured an invitation 
to the 1917 Rose Bowl against the Oregon Ducks.[21] Although the best offensive 
gain for Penn during their 20–14 loss to Oregon was a 20-yard run by Bell, 
he was replaced late in the game at quarterback after throwing an interception.[22] 
In the 1917 season, Bell led Penn to a 9–2 record.[19] Afterwards, he registered 
with a Mobile Hospital Unit of the US Army for World War I and was deployed 
to France in May 1918.[23] As a result of his unit participating in hazardous 
duty, it received a congratulatory letter for bravery from General John 
J. Pershing,[23] and Bell was promoted to first sergeant.[24] After the 
war, Bell returned to the United States in March 1919.[23] He returned 
to Penn as captain of the team in the fall and again performed erratically.[24] 
The Quakers finished 1919 with a 6–2–1 record.[19] Academically, his aversion 
to attending classes forced him to withdraw from Penn without a degree 
in early 1920.[25] His collegiate days ended with his having been a borderline 
All-American,[26] but this period of his life had proven that he "possessed 
the qualities of a leader."[27] Bell assembled the Stanley Professionals 
in Chicago in 1920, but he disbanded it prior to playing any games because 
of negative publicity received by Chicago due the Black Sox Scandal.[28] 
He joined John Heisman's staff at Penn as an assistant coach in 1920, and 
Bell would remain there for several years.[29] At Penn, he was well regarded 
as a football coach, and after its 1924 season, he drew offers for, but 
declined, head-coaching assignments at other universities.[29] At least 
as early as 1926, his avocation was socializing[30] and frequenting Saratoga 
Race Course, where he counted as friends Tim Mara, Art Rooney, and George 
Preston Marshall.[31] In 1928, Bell tendered his resignation at Penn in 
protest over the emphasis of in-season scrimmages during practices by Lud 
Wray, a fellow assistant coach.[32] Bell's resignation was accommodated 
prior to the start of the 1929 season.[32] Bell was then an employee of 
the Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia. At one point, he tried his hand as a 
stock broker and lost $50,000 (presently, $690,213) during the Wall Street 
Crash of 1929.[33] His father bailed him out of his deprivation, and he 
returned to working at the Ritz.[33] From 1930 until 1932, he was a backfield 
coach for the Temple Owls football team.[34] In 1932, Marshall tried to 
coax Bell into buying the rights to a NFL franchise, but Bell disparaged 
the league and ridiculed the idea.[35] When Pop Warner was hired to coach 
Temple for the 1933 season, Warner chose to hire his own assistants and 
Bell was let go.[36] By early 1933, Bell's opinion on the NFL had changed, 
and he wanted to become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia.[37] After 
being advised by the NFL that a prerequisite to a franchise being rendered 
in Philadelphia was that the Pennsylvania Blue Laws would have to be mollified,[38] 
he was the force majeure in lobbying to getting the laws deprecated.[38] 
He borrowed funds from Frances Upton,[39] partnered with Wray,[39] and 
he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia[39] which he christened 
as the Philadelphia Eagles.[40] After the inaugural 1933 Philadelphia Eagles 
season,[41] Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church 
in Philadelphia.[42] Days later, his suggestion to bestow the winner of 
the NFL championship game with the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy was affirmed.[43] 
In 1934, the Eagles finished with a 4–7 record,[44] The Eagles' inability 
to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets,[45] 
and his failure to sign a talented college prospect[46] led him to adduce 
that the only way to bring stability to the league was to institute a draft 
to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent 
players.[47] In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted,[48] and in 
February 1936, the first draft kicked off, at which he acted as Master 
of Ceremonies.[49] Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born.[50] 
In the Eagles' first three years, the partners exhausted $85,000 (presently, 
$1,451,930),[51] and at a public auction, Bell became sole owner of the 
Eagles with a bid of $4,500 (presently, $76,867).[52] Austerity measures 
forced him to supplant Wray as head coach of the Eagles,[53] wherein Bell 
led the Eagles to an 1–11 finish, their worst record ever.[54] In December, 
an application for a franchise in Los Angeles was obstructed by Bell and 
Pittsburgh Steelers owner Rooney as they deemed it too far of a distance 
to travel for games.[55] During the Eagles' 2-8-1 1937 season,[56] his 
second child, John "Upton", was born.[57] In the Eagles' first profitable 
season, 1938, they posted a 5–6 record.[58] The Eagles finished 1–9–1 in 
1939 and 1–10 in 1940.[59] In December 1940, Bell conciliated the sale 
of Rooney's Steelers to Alexis Thompson,[60] and then Rooney acquired half 
of Bell's interest in the Eagles.[61] In a series of events known as the 
Pennsylvania Polka,[60] Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster 
and their territorial rights in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire 
Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh.[62] Ostensibly, Rooney had 
provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission on the 
sale of the Steelers.[63] Bell became the Steelers head coach and Rooney 
became the general manager.[64] During the training camp of the Pittsburgh's 
inaugural season with the nickname Steelers, Bell was buoyant with optimism 
about the team's prospect, but he became crestfallen after Rooney denigrated 
the squad and flippantly remarked that they looked like the "[s]ame old 
Steelers" (SOS).[65] After losing the first two games of the 1941 season, 
Rooney compelled Bell into resigning as head coach.[66] Bell's coaching 
career ended with a 10–46–2 record, and for coaches with at least five 
years in the NFL, it is the worst record ever (as of the 2012 season).[67] 
His first daughter and last child, Jane Upton, was born several months 
after the season's conclusion.[68] By 1943, 40% of the NFL rosters had 
been drafted into the United States Armed Forces for World War II.[69] 
The resulting difficulty in fielding a full-strength squad led some owners 
to recommend the league should shut down until the war ended. Bell auspiciously 
argued against this as he feared they might not be able to resume operations 
easily after the war, and since Major League Baseball was continuing unabated, 
then they should also.[70] Throughout Bell's affiliation with the Steelers, 
he suffered monetarily and Rooney bought an increasing allotment of the 
franchise from him.[71] Compounding Bell's problems, Arch Ward organized 
the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1944 to displace the NFL's 
sovereignty in professional football.[72] Ward's AAFC promptly began luring 
players to join the league,[73] which resulted in salaries being driven 
up drastically.[74] In Bill Dudley's contract proceedings with the Steelers, 
he attributed Bell's anxiety during the negotiations to the rivalry from 
the AAFC.[75] Furthermore, by the end of 1945, the Steelers were in their 
most economically perilous situation in its history.[76] Elmer Layden was 
appointed the first NFL commissioner in 1941, but Ward appeared as dictating 
his hiring.[77] Layden tendered his resignation for personal reasons January 
1946.[78] Bell, who was not well respected in Pittsburgh,[79] was elected 
to replace him.[80] He received a three-year contract at $20,000 ($243,106) 
per year,[81] and transacted a sale of his stake in the Steelers to Rooney,[82] 
albeit for a price Bell did not construe was full-value.[83] He was then 
immediately placed at the center of a controversy wherein the owners denied 
Dan Reeves permission to relocate the Cleveland Rams to Los Angeles.[84] 
Bell moderated a settlement, and, as a result, the Los Angeles Rams were 
formed.[84] As a precondition to the Rams leasing the Los Angeles Coliseum, 
they signed Kenny Washington, which marked the beginning of the end of 
racial segregation on the field, but also caused "'all hell to break loose'" 
amidst the owners.[85] The drawing up of a regular season schedule had 
been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league's 
inception.[86] The crux of the problem was the scheduling of games meant 
weighing the interest of owners who, early in the season, wanted their 
franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners 
who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their team's win-loss record.[87] 
The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell 
the sole discretion in developing the league's schedule.[88] He utilized 
this responsibility to, early in the season, pit the weaker teams against 
other weak teams, and the strong teams against other strong teams.[89] 
His goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team 
standings to a minimum as deep into the season as possible.[89] On the 
eve of the 1946 championship game, Bell was notified that Merle Hapes and 
Frank Filchock of the New York Giants had been implicated in a bribing 
scandal.[90] Filchock was sanctioned by Bell to play in the game but Hapes 
was suspended.[91] At the next NFL owners' meeting, Bell was worried the 
repercussions from this event would lead to his firing.[92] However he 
was pleasantly surprised to learn that his contract would be elevated to 
five years at $30,000 per year.[93] Reinvigorated with renewed support, 
he persuaded the owners to allow him to put sudden-death overtime into 
the playoffs.[94] Subsequently, he wrote an anti-gambling resolution into 
the league constitution,[95] which empowered him with the ability to permanently 
ban any NFL associated personnel for betting on a game or for withholding 
information on a game being possibly fixed.[96] Furthermore, to obstruct 
gamblers from getting inside information, he secreted the names of officials 
he would assign to games,[92] and he directed each team to promulgate a 
precursory injury report which listed anyone who might not participate 
in a game.[97] Eventually, he lobbied to get every state in the US to criminalize 
the fixing of sporting events[98] and put employees on the payroll of the 
NFL to investigate potential betting scams.[99] The NFL's struggle against 
the AAFC generated stress on wages,[100] attendance,[101] marketing,[102] 
and by 1949, it had prevented the NFL for showing a profit for three consecutive 
years.[103] Bell and representatives from both leagues met to attempt a 
merger, but their efforts were fruitless.[104] In an unrelated matter, 
he apprised the owners that attendance records had shown televising games 
locally had a negative impact on the sale of home tickets.[105] Nevertheless, 
he actualized the NFL's first television contract[106]—the 1949 championship 
game.[107] Simultaneously, he dealt with a lawsuit from Bill Radovich, 
who had been blacklisted for leaving the Lions and gaining employment with 
the AAFC.[108] Bell and the owners were advised by John C. Jr. that this 
lawsuit was potentially not winnable, and the ramifications from the outcome 
of the case weighed heavily on Bell.[109] One of the primary impediments 
in an AAFC-NFL merger was the supposed violation of "territorial rights" 
claimed by Marshall.[110] Eventually, Bell gathered enough support to effectuate 
a compromise with the AAFC.[111] In late 1949, the leagues merged,[112] 
and Bell would stay on as commissioner[112] with his contract extended 
from five to ten years[113] as three AAFC teams (the Cleveland Browns, 
San Francisco 49ers, and Baltimore Colts) were subsumed.[112] Seeking to 
capitalize on the publicity of the residual rivalry, he utilized "exquisite 
dramatic" and business sense and allocated the 1950 opening game to a contest 
between the 1949 champion Eagles versus the perennial AAFC champion Browns.[114] 
Feeling financially secure after the merger, he purchased his first home 
for himself and his family in Narberth, Pennsylvania.[83] In 1950, Bell 
originated a blackout rule into the NFL which forbid all teams to televise 
their home games within a 75-mile radius of their stadium – except for 
the Rams.[115] Consequently, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) 
opened an investigation into a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.[116] 
Ensuingly, the Rams attendance for 1950 dropped off by 50%,[117] and this 
signaled a potential financial disaster.[118] In 1951, he licensed the 
DuMont Television Network to air the championship games for the next five 
years, and he stipulated that teams were free to develop their own television 
contracts independently.[119] However, preceding 1951 season, he reimposed 
the blackout rule on all teams in the league.[120] The DOJ filed suit over 
this and Bell publicly retorted, "You can't give fans a game for free on 
TV and also expect them to go to the ballpark"; nevertheless, the suit 
was ordered to trial for January 1952.[121] After the 1951 season ended, 
he gained unilateral control over the setting of a television strategy 
for the NFL.[122] He negotiated a deal with DuMont, which granted it the 
rights to nationally broadcast one regular season game every week,[123] 
and he directed that the income from this contract was to be shared equally 
between all the teams.[124] In the DOJ's case, the judge ruled that the 
blackout policy was legal, but both Bell, and the franchises collectively, 
were enjoined from negotiating a TV contract;[125] Bell was ecstatic.[126] 
Later that year, Bell forced one of the owners of the Cleveland Browns 
to sell all of his shares in the team after Bell determined the owner had 
bet on Browns' football games.[127] Although he hated to fly,[128] at some 
indeterminate point, he visited the training camps of every team and lectured 
on the danger gamblers posed to the league.[129] Bell authorized a Pro 
Bowl to be held at the end of each season in order to showcase the talents 
of the best players.[130] But in the early 1950s, on the field activities 
sometimes denigrated to borderline assault and battery[131] with teams' 
star players being viciously targeted by opposing players.[132] He answered 
charges the league was too savage by saying, "'I have never seen a maliciously 
dirty football player in my life and I don't believe there are any.'"[133] 
Nevertheless, he ordered broadcasts to follow a strict rule of conduct 
whereby TV announcers would not be permitted to criticize the game, and 
neither fights, nor injuries, could be televised by virtue in his belief 
that announcers were "'salesman for professional football [and] we do not 
want kids believing that engaging in fights is the way to play football.'"[134] 
Bell was criticized for censoring TV broadcasts, a charge he dismissed 
as not pertinent because he believed he was not impeding the print media 
but only advertising a product.[135] After CBS and NBC gained the rights 
to broadcast the games in 1956,[136] he advised the franchises to avoid 
criticizing the games or the officials, and forewarned that TV would give 
"'us our greatest opportunity to sell the NFL and everyone must present 
to the public the greatest games ... combined with the finest sportsmanship.'"[137] 
This relationship with television was the beginning of the NFL's rise to 
becoming America's most popular sport.[138] In Radovich v. National Football 
League, the Supreme Court ruled in Radovich's favor and declared the NFL 
was subject to antitrust laws,[139] and the implication was that the legality 
of the draft and reserve clause were dubious.[140] Bell pressed a case 
in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations 
and proffered the league was a sport and not a business.[141] He invited 
an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling.[142] 
The House Judiciary committee, chaired by Emanuel Celler—who believed the 
draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss 
the ramifications of the Radovich decision.[143] Red Grange and Bell testified 
at the committee's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the 
sport's success.[144] Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements 
and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed 
as if Congress was going to accept their position.[145] Faced with Congressional 
opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate 
with its representatives.[145] However, Bell was speaking only for himself 
and without the auspices of the owners.[146] At the next owners' meeting, 
Rooney admonished they either had to recognize the NFLPA or remove Bell 
as commissioner.[147] In order to do this, they had to agree in a vote 
that required a super-majority.[148] Bell unsuccessfully attempted to persuade 
the owners to permit the NFLPA to act as a bargaining agent for the players.[149] 
However, he did reach a compromise with the owners to get them to acquiesce 
to some of the NFLPA's requests for salary standards and health benefits.[149] 
For the 1958 season, the durations of timeouts was extended from 60 to 
90 seconds[150] and Bell mandated officials call a few TV timeouts during 
each game — a change which triggered criticism from sportswriters.[151] 
The 1958 championship game became the first NFL championship game decided 
in overtime[152] and it was considered to be the greatest football game 
ever played.[153] The game further increased football's marketability to 
television advertising,[154] and the drama associated with overtime was 
the catalyst.[155] Years later, after witnessing Bell openly crying after 
the game, Raymond Berry attributed it to Bell's realization of the impact 
the game would have on the prevalence of the sport.[156] The death of Mara 
in February 1959 unsettled Bell and he experienced a heart attack later 
that month.[157] He converted to Catholicism in the summer of 1959 because 
of the lifelong urging of his wife,[98] Mara's death, and his enduring 
friendship with Rooney,[158] a practicing Catholic.[159] Bell was advised 
by his doctor to avoid going to football games, to which he quipped, "I'd 
rather die watching football than in my bed with my boots off."[157] Bell 
and his children attended an Eagles game at Franklin Field on October 11, 
1959.[160] The Eagles held complimentary box seats for him and guests to 
watch the game, but he preferred to buy his own tickets and sit with the 
other fans.[160] Sitting behind the end zone during the fourth quarter 
of the game, he suffered a heart attack and died later that day.[161] Afterwards, 
he was remembered as "a man of buoyant joviality, with a rough and ready 
wit, laughter and genuine humility and honesty, clearly innocent of pretense 
and [pretension]."[162] His funeral was held at Narberth's St. Margaret 
Roman Catholic Church and Monsignor Cornelius P. Brennan delivered the 
eulogy, as close friends and admirers attended the mass.[163] Dominic Olejniczak 
and all the extant owners of the NFL franchises were pallbearers.[164] 
Bell was interred at Calvary Cemetery in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.[165] 
Bell was inducted into the Professional Football Hall of Fame,[166] the 
Penn Athletics Hall of Fame,[167] the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame,[168] 
and Haverford's Athletic Hall of Fame.[12] The Maxwell Football Club, which 
he founded in 1937,[169] has presented the best NFL player of the year 
with the Bert Bell Award since 1959.[170] The Bert Bell Benefit Bowl was 
exhibited in his honor from 1960 through 1969.[166] Though his career spanned 
the desegregation and reintegration of the NFL, as an owner, he never had 
an African American on any of his teams, but Bert Jr. believed the mere 
discussion of whether his father was prejudiced was absurd.[98] Bell's 
handling of the merger with the AAFC was acclaimed as a personal triumph.[171] 
Although he did not have the wherewithal to prevent the wholesale betting 
on games,[172] he was proactive in ensuring games were not tampered with 
by gamblers,[173] and he created the foundation of the contemporary NFL 
anti-gambling policy.[174] Bell was criticized as being too strict with 
his refusal to let sold-out games to be televised locally.[175] Nevertheless, 
his balancing of television broadcasts against protecting game attendance 
made the NFL the "healthiest professional sport in America",[92] and he 
was the "leading protagonist in pro football's evolution into America's 
major sport."[176] He had understood that the league needed a cooperative 
television contract with revenue-sharing, but he failed to overcome the 
obstacles to achieve it.[177] He was portrayed by sportswriters as ensuring 
the owners treated the players fairly,[178] and his decision to recognize 
the NFLPA in the face of adversity from owners was a "master stroke" in 
thwarting Congressional intervention.[145] After he initiated terms for 
a pension plan with the players in 1959, little progress was made with 
the NFLPA,[179][180] however, the first players' pension plan-the Bert 
Bell National Football League Retirement Plan, was approved in 1962.[181] 
Bell's implementation of the draft did not show immediate results,[182] 
but it was "the single greatest contributor to the [league]'s prosperity" 
in its first eighty-four years.[183] His original version of the draft 
was later ruled unconstitutional,[184] but his anchoring of the success 
of the league to competitive balance has been "hailed by contemporaries 
and sports historians".[185] Bell had often said, "[o]n any given Sunday, 
any team in the NFL can beat any other team."[186] Pound (#) sign denotes interim head coach.
