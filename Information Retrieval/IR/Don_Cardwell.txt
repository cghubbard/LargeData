Donald Eugene Cardwell (December 7, 1935 – January 14, 2008) was an American 
Major League Baseball (MLB) right-handed pitcher who played for five National 
League (NL) teams from 1957 to 1970. He was the first pitcher in major 
league history to pitch a no-hitter in his first game after being traded. 
He pitched a no-hit, 4–0 winning game for the Chicago Cubs on May 15, 1960, 
just two days after being traded from the Philadelphia Phillies. After 
winning 15 games for the Cubs in 1961, he won 13 games twice for the Pittsburgh 
Pirates before helping the New York Mets win the 1969 World Series title. 
Born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Cardwell signed with the Philadelphia 
Phillies as an amateur free agent in 1954. Cardwell began playing in the 
major leagues when he made his debut for the Phillies in 1957. He struggled 
during his three seasons with the team, winning 16 games while losing 24 
as a spot starter. Cardwell was traded to the Cubs on May 13, 1960, for 
Tony Taylor. Two days later, he no-hit the St. Louis Cardinals 4–0 in the 
second game of a doubleheader at Wrigley Field—the first no-hitter ever 
thrown by a pitcher in his first start with a new team. The lone baserunner 
for the Cardinals was by a walk from Cardwell to Alex Grammas with one 
out in the first inning; Cardwell then retired the next 26 batters. Two 
ninth-inning catches enabled Cardwell to secure the no-hitter: the first 
catch by Cubs right fielder George Altman on a Carl Sawatski line drive 
for the first out of the inning, and the second catch by Cubs left fielder 
Walt "Moose" Moryn on Joe Cunningham's sinking line drive to end the game, 
Moryn catching the ball just inches off the ground. Cardwell finished the 
season 9–16 and the Cubs 60–94 despite his no-hitter. Cardwell also showed 
his hitting ability in 1960, getting 16 hits including five home runs in 
77 at bats for a .208 batting average. Cardwell's best major league season 
was for the Cubs in 1961, winning a career-high 15 games with a career-high 
156 strikeouts. Cardwell slumped to 7–16 in 1962. On October 12, he was 
traded with George Altman to the St. Louis Cardinals. However, his stay 
in St. Louis ended before he even pitched a game for the St. Louis team. 
A month later, the Cardinals traded him to the Pittsburgh Pirates in a 
deal that sent former National League MVP Dick Groat to St. Louis. Cardwell 
won 13 games for the Pirates in 1963 while posting a career-best 3.07 earned 
run average. He was sidelined most of the 1964 season with shoulder trouble.[1] 
In the 1965 season, he rebounded to win 13 more games. In December 1966, 
he was traded with Pirates outfielder Don Bosch to the New York Mets for 
pitcher Dennis Ribant and utilityman Gary Kolb.[2] Pitching mostly as a 
spot starter, Cardwell went 12–22 in his first two seasons with the Mets. 
In the 1969 season, he went 8–10 in a rotation with pitchers Tom Seaver, 
Jerry Koosman, Nolan Ryan and Gary Gentry, helping them win the World Series. 
In late July of that year, he had a 3–9 record, then won five straight, 
including a 1–0 shutout in the second game of a September 12 doubleheader 
against the Pirates (in the first game, Koosman had also blanked the Pirates 
1–0; both pitchers drove in the only run in their respective games). This 
victory, the ninth of a ten-game winning streak for the Mets, came two 
days after the Mets had taken over first place for good in the National 
League East (in 1969 the two leagues had been split into two divisions) 
by leapfrogging past the Chicago Cubs, who had been in first place for 
much of the season, only to stumble late in the season. Cardwell was sold 
to the Atlanta Braves in July 1970,[3] where he ended his major league 
career. In his 14 major league seasons, he won 102 games while losing 138 
games with 1,211 strikeouts in 2,122 2⁄3 innings pitched. Cardwell died 
on January 14, 2008 of Pick's disease in Winston-Salem. He had lived in
