Warren Vincent "Buddy" Rosar (July 3, 1914 – March 13, 1994) was an American 
professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher 
from 1939 to 1951 for the New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, Philadelphia 
Athletics, and Boston Red Sox. A five-time All-Star, Rosar was regarded 
as an excellent defensive catcher, setting a major league record for consecutive 
games without an error by a catcher.[1] He is one of only three catchers 
in Major League history to catch at least 100 games in a single season 
without committing an error.[2] Rosar was first discovered in 1934 when 
he was chosen to play in an All-Star game for Buffalo, New York amateur 
baseball players.[3] The wife of New York Yankees manager, Joe McCarthy, 
attended the game and was so impressed with Rosar's catching ability that 
she told her husband about him.[3] McCarthy sent Yankees' scout, Gene McCann 
to look at Rosar before the team signed him as an amateur free agent.[3] 
He played for the 1937 Newark Bears team that won the International League 
pennant by 25½ games to become known as one of the best minor league teams 
of all time.[3][4] Rosar hit .387 with the Bears in 1938 to win the International 
League batting championship.[5] Rosar made his major league debut with 
the Yankees on April 29, 1939 at the age of 24.[6] From 1939 to 1942, he 
served as the Yankees' back up catcher to the future Hall of Fame inductee 
Bill Dickey.[7] By the middle of the 1940 season, Rosar was out-hitting 
Dickey with a .343 batting average compared to Dickey's .226 average although, 
he appeared in only half as many games as, the Yankees were reluctant to 
relegate Dickey to second string status.[8][9][10] On July 19, 1940, he 
hit for the cycle in a game against the Cleveland Indians.[11] Rosar appeared 
in 73 games in 1940 and set career-highs with a .298 batting average and 
a .357 on-base percentage.[6] In 1941, he hit well above .300 until the 
final month of the season before tapering off to end the year with a .287 
average in 67 games as, the Yankees won the American League pennant by 
17 games over the Boston Red Sox.[12] Rosar made only one appearance in 
the 1941 World Series as a late-inning defensive replacement for Dickey 
in Game 2 as, the Yankees went on to defeat the Brooklyn Dodgers in five 
games.[13][14] Despite being a second string catcher, American League managers 
chose Rosar to be a reserve player in the 1942 All-Star Game over all other 
starting catchers in the league, with the exception of Birdie Tebbetts 
of the Detroit Tigers, who was selected to start the game.[15] In July 
1942, Rosar asked Yankees manager, Joe McCarthy, for permission to travel 
to Buffalo to take examinations to join the Buffalo police force and, to 
be with his wife who was about to have a baby.[16] McCarthy refused to 
allow him to leave because Dickey was sidelined with an injury leaving 
only unseasoned rookie catcher Eddie Kearse available but, Rosar decided 
to leave without permission.[17] When he returned to the club three days 
later, he found that McCarthy had replaced him with Rollie Hemsley and 
sent Kearse to the minor leagues, relegating Rosar to third-string catcher.[16] 
Rosar had been seen as a successor to the aging Dickey but, after flouting 
the authority of the Yankees management, he would be traded to the Cleveland 
Indians by the end of the season.[18][19] Although Indians manager, Lou 
Boudreau, named Gene Desautels as the Indians starting catcher at the beginning 
of the 1943 season, by the middle of the year Rosar was among the league 
leaders in hitting with a .313 average.[20][21] He was recognised by being 
named to his second All-Star team as a reserve in the 1943 All-Star Game.[22] 
He ended the season with a .283 batting average and 41 runs batted in.[6] 
He also led American League catchers in assists and in baserunners caught 
stealing.[23] In 1944, Rosar was assigned to a war job in Buffalo, New 
York before being transferred to another war job in Cleveland, leaving 
him available part-time to the Indians.[24] He was again hitting among 
the league leaders with a .324 average in June before fading to finish 
the year with a .263 batting average.[6][25][26] After two seasons with 
the Indians, Rosar refused to play at the beginning of the 1945 season 
because of a salary dispute.[27] The Indians responded by trading Rosar 
to the Philadelphia Athletics for catcher Frankie Hayes on May 29, 1945.[19] 
Rosar had one of his best seasons in the major leagues with Connie Mack's 
Philadelphia Athletics in 1946, hitting for a .283 batting average and 
posted career-highs with 120 hits and 48 runs batted in.[6] He led American 
League catchers in assists, runners caught stealing, and fielding percentage, 
setting a record for errorless games by a catcher, posting a 1.000 fielding 
percentage in 117 games played as a catcher.[28][29] The next year he extended 
his perfect play to 147 games and, was selected to be the starting catcher 
for the American League in the 1947 All-Star Game.[1][29][30] The errorless 
games record has since been broken by several players. Rosar was hitting 
for just a .216 batting average by mid-season in 1948 however, his defensive 
reputation won him the fans' vote as the American League's starting catcher 
in the 1948 All-Star Game.[31][32] During a three-season period between 
1946 and 1948, Rosar committed only three errors.[6] By 1949, Mike Guerra 
had taken over as the Athletics starting catcher and, Rosar would be traded 
to the Boston Red Sox in October 1949.[19] With the Red Sox, he was the 
third string catcher behind Birdie Tebbetts and Matt Batts in 1950 and 
then to Les Moss in 1951 before being released in October 1951.[6] In a 
thirteen-year major league career, Rosar played in 988 games, with 836 
hits for a .261 career batting average, along with 18 home runs and 367 
runs batted in.[6] Despite his relatively low offensive statistics, Rosar's 
defensive skills earned him a place on the American League All-Star team 
five times during his career.[6] Rosar led all American League catchers 
in fielding percentage four years (1944, 1946–1948).[33] He also led the 
league three times in assists, twice in baserunners caught stealing and 
once in caught stealing percentage.[6] His 54.81% career caught stealing 
percentage ranks him third all-time behind only Roy Campanella and Gabby 
Hartnett.[34] Rosar caught two no hitter games in his career, pitched by 
Dick Fowler in 1945, and Bill McCahan in 1947.[35] He has the best ratio 
of double plays to errors of any catcher in major league history.[36] Rosar 
holds the 20th Century career record for fewest passed balls per games 
caught (0.0300) with only 28 miscues in 934 games as catcher.[29] Rosar's 
.992 career fielding percentage was 10 points higher than the league average 
during his playing career, and at the time of his retirement in 1951, was 
the highest for a catcher in major league history.[37] After Rosar's baseball 
career, he was employed as an engineer at a Ford plant near his hometown
