Harrison is a town in Hudson County, New Jersey, United States. It is a 
suburb of the nearby city of Newark, New Jersey. As of the 2010 United 
States Census, Harrison's population was 13,620,[9][10][11][12] reflecting 
a decline of 804 (−5.6%) from the 14,424 counted in the 2000 Census, which 
had in turn increased by 999 (+7.4%) from the 13,425 counted in the 1990 
Census.[21] Once considered "the beehive of industry", the town is undergoing 
a residential renewal, particularly along the Passaic River.[22] The area 
that is now Harrison was a part of a charter granted to Captain William 
Sandford of Barbados. New Barbadoes Neck consisted of 30,000 acres (120 km2) 
and extended north from Newark Bay to present-day Rutherford, between the 
Passaic and Hackensack Rivers. Sandford sent his nephew, Major Nathanial 
Kingsland, to enter into an agreement for the purchase the land from the 
Unami Native Americans, a branch of the Leni Lenape.[23] In 1755, the first 
steam engine in North America was set up at the Schuyler Copper Mine in 
what is now North Arlington to help drain water from the mine. A road to 
the Hudson Waterfront was completed in 1750, named for Douwe's Ferry which 
it met at its eastern end to cross the Haceknsack River.[24] In 1790 the 
state legislature decided that "public good would be served by a 64-foot 
road from Paulus Hook to Newark Couthouse". By 1795, a bridge over the 
Hackensack 950 feet (290 m) long and another over the Passaic 492 feet 
(150 m) long (at the site of the Bridge Street Bridge) were built creating 
an uninterrupted toll road connection.[25] It is now known as the Newark 
Turnpike. In 1826, the New Jersey Legislature, Lodi Township was formed 
from the southern portion of New Barbadoes Neck in Bergen County.[26][27] 
Since Lodi Township was part of Bergen County, matters dealing with the 
county government and courts had to be taken to Hackensack. In 1840, the 
inhabitants of Lodi Township joined with present-day Secaucus, Bayonne, 
Jersey City, Hoboken, Weehawken, and Union City and petitioned for the 
creation of a new county due to the great distance which the petitioners 
had to travel to reach the county seat in Hackensack. This appeal resulted 
in the creation of Hudson County and the first mention of Harrison occurs 
in the law which was passed on April 13, 1840. Harrison Township was thereby 
established.[27][28] The first committee meeting of the Township of Harrison 
was held on April 16, 1840, and it is widely accepted that Harrison was 
named for President William Henry Harrison, who was elected that year.[29] 
Union Township was created as of February 19, 1852, from portions of the 
township and became part of Bergen County.[27] General N. N. Halstead succeeded 
in getting the necessary laws passed in Trenton and April 8, 1867, Kearny 
became a separate Township from land that was a part of Harrison, which 
included East Newark at the time; East Newark later seceded from Kearny, 
establishing their own Borough.[27] On March 25, 1869, Harrison town was 
incorporated, replacing the township.[27] While campaigning for re-election 
in 1912, President William Howard Taft told residents gathered for a rally 
that "you have reason to be proud of this Hive of Industry", from which 
was coined the town's motto, "The Beehive of Industry", which is still 
used today.[1][28] The town's proximity to rail lines and a large waterfront 
made Harrison favorably situated for trade. Some of the industries which 
called Harrison home included the Edison Lamp Works, Worthington Pump and 
Machinery, the RCA Company, the Peter Hauck Brewery, Driver-Harris Company, 
Crucible Steel Company, Otis Elevator, Hartz Mountain, Remco Industries, 
Nopco Chemical and Hyatt Roller Bearing.[citation needed] As the U.S. moved 
into the 20th century, these facilities played a major role in the development 
of new products for both the private and public sector, peaking during 
World War II. The small town of about only 14,000 residents had more than 
90,000 workers commuting into it on a daily basis.[30] In the 21st century 
the town is undergoing a transformation from a manufacturing center to 
a residential and service sector town.[31] According to the United States 
Census Bureau, the town had a total area of 1.319 square miles (3.416 km2), 
including 1.203 square miles (3.116 km2) of land and 0.116 square miles 
(0.299 km2) of water (8.76%).[2][3] Unincorporated communities located 
partially or completely within Harrison include Manhattan Transfer.[32] 
The town borders the municipalities of East Newark and Kearny in Hudson 
County; and Newark in Essex County.[33] At the 2010 United States Census, 
there were 13,620 people, 4,869 households, and 3,262 families residing 
in the town. The population density was 11,319.3 per square mile (4,370.4/km2).

As of the 2000 Census, 7.22% of Harrison's residents identified themselves 
as being of Chinese ancestry. This was the fifth-highest percentage of 
people with Chinese ancestry in any place in New Jersey with 1,000 or more 
residents identifying their ancestry.[46] There were 5,136 households out 
of which 33.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 49.8%

Harrison is governed under the Town form of New Jersey municipal government. 
The government consists of a mayor and Town Council comprising eight council 
members elected on a partisan basis as part of the November general elections. 
A mayor is elected directly by the voters at-large to a four-year term 
of office. The Town Council consists of eight members elected to serve 
four-year terms on a staggered basis, with one seat from each of the four 
wards up for vote one year, one seat from each of the four wards up the 
next year and then two years with no elections.[7] The town is divided 
into four electoral wards, with each ward represented by two council members, 
with a total of eight council members on the Town Council. Each ward is 
divided into three districts (except for the 1st Ward, which has two districts), 
for a total of 11 electoral districts. The head of the government is the 
mayor. The mayor chairs the Town Council and heads the municipal government. 
The Mayor may both vote on legislation before the Council and veto ordinances. 
The Mayor's veto can be overruled by ¾ of the Town Council voting to overrule 
the veto. Town Council meetings are held on the first Tuesday of the month 
at 7:00 pm (except in July and August, when no meetings are held, at the 
call of the chairman), in Council Chambers, which is located on the second 
floor of the Town Hall at 318 Harrison Avenue. Public Caucus Meetings are 
held at 6:30 pm. As of 2016[update], the Mayor of Harrsion is Democrat 
James A. Fife, who is serving a term of office ending December 31, 2018.[4] 
While serving a term scheduled to end on December 31, 2014, longtime Mayor 
Raymond McDonough died on February 12, 2014, after suffering a heart attack 
at town hall.[47] The town council selected Fife, a former Harrison High 
School principal, to complete the term.[48] Members of the Harrison Town 
Council are Laurence M. Bennett (D, 2018; Ward 3), Michael Dolaghan (D, 
2019; Ward 4), James P. Doran (D, 2018; Ward 4), Jesus R. Huaranga (D, 
2018; Ward 1), Carol Mandaglio (D, 2019; Ward 1), Anselmo Millan (D, 2018; 
Ward 2), Francisco Nascimento (D, 2019; Ward 3) and Victor Villalta (D, 
2019; Ward 2).[4][49][50][51][52][53] Harrison had one of the longest-serving 
mayors in American history, Frank E. Rodgers, who was first elected in 
1946, defeating incumbent Frederick J. Gassert who had served for 16 years, 
and served for 48 years, from 1947 to 1995, being elected to 24 two-year 
terms. He also served one term in the New Jersey State Senate, from 1979 
to 1983.[54] Harrison is located in the 8th Congressional District[55] 
and is part of New Jersey's 32nd state legislative district.[11][56][57] 
Prior to the 2010 Census, Harrison had been part of the 13th Congressional 
District, a change made by the New Jersey Redistricting Commission that 
took effect in January 2013, based on the results of the November 2012 
general elections.[58] New Jersey's Eighth Congressional District is represented 
by Albio Sires (D, West New York).[59] New Jersey is represented in the 
United States Senate by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term ends 2021)[60] and 
Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 2019).[61][62] For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, 
General Assembly), the 32nd Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature 
is represented in the State Senate by Nicholas Sacco (D, North Bergen) 
and in the General Assembly by Angelica M. Jimenez (D, West New York) and 
Vincent Prieto (D, Secaucus).[63] The Governor of New Jersey is Chris Christie 
(R, Mendham Township).[64] The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is Kim 
Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[65] The Hudson County Executive, elected 
at-large, is Thomas A. DeGise.[66]Hudson County Board of Chosen Freeholders 
District 9, comprising the West Hudson towns of Kearny, Harrison, and East 
Newark and most of Secaucus,[67] is represented by Albert Cifelli.[68][69] 
As of March 23, 2011, there were a total of 5,454 registered voters in 
Harrison, of which 3,207 (58.8%) were registered as Democrats, 312 (5.7%) 
were registered as Republicans and 1,934 (35.5%) were registered as Unaffiliated. 
There was one voter registered to another party.[70] In the 2012 presidential 
election, Democrat Barack Obama received 78.4% of the vote (2,699 cast), 
ahead of Republican Mitt Romney with 20.0% (689 votes), and other candidates 
with 1.6% (54 votes), among the 3,473 ballots cast by the town's 5,940 
registered voters (31 ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 58.5%.[71][72] 
In the 2008 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama received 68.0% 
of the vote (2,347 cast), ahead of Republican John McCain with 30.0% (1,036 
votes) and other candidates with 1.1% (38 votes), among the 3,453 ballots 
cast by the town's 5,827 registered voters, for a turnout of 59.3%.[73] 
In the 2004 presidential election, Democrat John Kerry received 64.8% of 
the vote (2,142 ballots cast), outpolling Republican George W. Bush with 
34.1% (1,128 votes) and other candidates with 0.3% (16 votes), among the 
3,306 ballots cast by the town's 5,411 registered voters, for a turnout 
percentage of 61.1.[74] In the 2013 gubernatorial election, Republican

with 1.3% (30 votes), among the 2,234 ballots cast by the town's 5,225 
registered voters, yielding a 42.8% turnout.[77] The Harrison Police Department 
is led by Derek J. Kearns, Chief of Police.[78] The department was among 
the many Hudson County agencies that responded to the January 2009 crash 
of Flight 1549, for which they received accolades from the survivors.[79][80] 
The Harrison Fire Department operates out of a fire station located at 
634 Sussex Street and operates a fire apparatus fleet of three engines, 
one ladder, and several special, support and reserve units. Due to cutbacks, 
the HFD usually is able to staff one engine with three members and one 
ladder with four members on duty. The HFD employs 25 firefighters. In April 
2013, officials from neighboring municipalities and fire departments expressed 
their frustration at the stresses placed on their firefighters in covering 
fires in Harrison.[81] As of January 1, 2014, Monmouth Ocean Hospital Service 
Corporation (MONOC) EMS provides 9-1-1 ambulance service to the city of 
Harrison and nearby East Newark. As part of the agreement, MONOC pays a 
$1,500 monthly fee for its use of the firehouse on Cleveland Avenue that 
had previously been used by Kearny Emergency Management Services.[82] The 
Harrison Public Schools serves students in Kindergarten through twelfth 
grade. The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide,[83] 
which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" based on the requirement for 
the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects 
in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development 
Authority.[84][85] As of the 2011–12 school year, the district's four schools 
had an enrollment of 2,031 students and 153.5 classroom teachers (on an 
FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.23:1.[86] Schools in the 
district (with 2011– enrollment data from the National Center for Education 
Statistics[87]) are Lincoln Elementary School[88] (grades Pre-K to 3; 653 
students), Hamilton Intermediate School[89] (4–5; 295), Washington Middle 
School[90] (6–8; 429) and Harrison High School[91] (9–12; 654).[92][93] 
In September 2007, Harrison realigned the grades being housed in each of 
the school buildings in town. The new Harrison High School located on Hamilton 
Street between Kingsland and Schuyler Avenues opened to students in grades 
9–12. As a result, the old Harrison High School building, located on 1 
North 5th Street, was renamed as Washington Middle School. The old Washington 
Middle School, in turn, located on Hamilton Street between North 2nd and 
North 3rd Streets, has been renamed Hamilton School and now houses the 
4th and 5th grades that formerly used the top floors of Holy Cross School. 
Holy Cross School has since been vacated by the Harrison Public School 
district. The Harrison Public School District is participating in the Interdistrict 
Public School Choice Program. For the 2005–06. school year parents can 
request to transfer a child from the Washington School, designated by the 
State of New Jersey as a Category I School, to another school which is 
not a Category I School. Since there is only one elementary school in Harrison, 
parents can request a transfer to the Hoboken Public Schools under the 
Choice program. A transfer request will depend upon the capacity of the 
selected Hoboken school.[94] In 2000, the then Harrison High School building 
(now Washington Middle School) was used as the location of an open casting 
call by HBO for the series The Sopranos, which brought 15,000-plus TV star 
hopefuls to the town, doubling the town's population and bringing traffic 
to a standstill.[95] In September 2013, Harrison High School was recognized 
with the National Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United 
States Department of Education, one of 286 in the country to receive the 
award that year.[96][97] Harrison Lions Club was chartered on July 25, 
1951. The Harrison Club is part of Multiple District 16 (New Jersey) which 
is part of Lions Clubs International (LCI), the world's largest service 
organization. The club supports and provides financial aid to the district, 
state, and international sight projects and is also involved in community 
programs.[98] As of May 2010[update], the town had a total of 18.15 miles 
(29.21 km) of roadways, of which 15.23 miles (24.51 km) were maintained 
by the municipality, 1.57 miles (2.53 km) by Hudson County and 1.35 miles 
(2.17 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.[99] By car, Harrison 
depends on Interstate 280 which runs through town. Westward, I-280 leads 
to Route 21, the Garden State Parkway, and Interstate 80. Eastward, it 
leads to Route 7 and the New Jersey Turnpike. Replacement of Interstate 
280's partial access in central Harrison with service roads, a new interchange, 
and an overpass (to improve access to Harrison Avenue, the PATH station, 
and Red Bull Arena, and to give north-south passage to local street traffic) 
is in the planning stages.[100][101] The Harrison station on the PATH rapid 
transit system offers service to Newark, Jersey City, Hoboken and New York 
City. Built in 1913 and relocated to its present location in 1936, its 
major reconstruction was approved on March 28, 2012, and was scheduled 
to run from January 2013 to April 2017.[102] The completion target was 
tentatively moved to 2018, and settling a required right-of-way renewal 
with Amtrak may delay the completion further.[103] The Northeast Corridor, 
built in the 19th century by the Pennsylvania Railroad and now owned by 
Amtrak, carries New Jersey Transit trains, and passes through the city 
on the same alignment as the PATH. There was a stop on the Northeast Corridor 
in Harrison, but it was eliminated due to the ease of picking up trains 
in Newark at Penn Station. Harrison is served by buses operated by several 
bus companies. New Jersey Transit offers service within New Jersey on the 
39, 30, 40 and 43 routes.[104] The closest airport in New Jersey with scheduled 
passenger service is Newark Liberty International Airport, located 4.8 
miles (7.7 km) away in Newark and Elizabeth. The Harrison Waterfront Redevelopment 
Plan invited developers to submit plans that capitalize on the presence 
of the Harrison PATH Station and the Passaic River within a 275-acre (1.11 km2) 
area that covers 35% of the whole town. The Plan seeks to unite the developers' 
proposals with a design theme that includes motifs from Harrison's industrial, 
cultural, and environmental history as a means of fostering a new identity 
for Harrison that provides a variety of mixed-use, transit-oriented, pedestrian-scale 
development that will make Harrison a regional destination.[105][106] After 
years of delay, Red Bull Arena opened on March 20, 2010, with an exhibition 
game against the Brazilian club Santos FC.[107] The soccer-specific stadium 
(SSS) was constructed at a cost of $200 million and has a capacity of approximately 
25,000, with a natural grass field, featuring a full wavy translucent European-style 
roof that covers all of the seats in the stadium but not the field.[108] 
The stadium sits alongside the Passaic River with a view of the Newark 
skyline, and is accessible via public transportation at the PATH train 
stop in Harrison.[109] The stadium is owned and operated by Red Bull GmbH.[110]
