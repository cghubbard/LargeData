The 1934 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the second playing of 
the mid-summer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) 
and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. 
The game was held on July 10 at the Polo Grounds in New York City, the 
home of the New York Giants of the National League. The game resulted in 
the American League defeating the National League 9–7. American League 
2–0. The game is well known among baseball fans for the performance of

of the game's best hitters – Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons
