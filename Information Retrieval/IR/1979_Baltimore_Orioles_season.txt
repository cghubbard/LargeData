The 1979 Baltimore Orioles season was a season in American baseball. The 
Orioles finished first in the American League East division of Major League 
Baseball with a record of 102 wins and 57 losses. They went on to defeat 
the California Angels in the 1979 American League Championship Series, 
3 games to 1, before losing in the 1979 World Series to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, 4 games to 3. The 1979 season represents a dividing line in Orioles 
history. Attendance was poor before it and terrific after it, steadily 
rising into the 1990s in a new ballpark at Camden Yards. Also, ownership 
changed hands in 1979, with a twelve-million-dollar sale marking the change 
from Jerry Hoffberger's Baltimore Baseball Group—a local, family-oriented 
operation—to Edward Bennett Williams, a powerhouse attorney from Washington, 
D.C. with ideas about moving the club to the nation's capital. Against 
the backdrop of noise and tension, the club played well, winning 102 games 
and the American League East title for the first time since 1974. The season 
was a return to glory days of the late '60s and early '70s under manager 
Earl Weaver, but this club was different in nature and spirit. The talent 
was not as dominant, but a blend of heart, skills, and original personalities 
produced a team as compelling and effective as any in Orioles history. 
Years later, it is still hard to say what happened in the summer of 1979, 
what caused Orioles games at Memorial Stadium to become more popular. It 
didn't hurt that pro football's Baltimore Colts, more popular for a long 
time, were coming apart under owner Robert Irsay; with the team losing 
and Irsay threatening to move, fans were abandoning the franchise and looking 
for an alternative.[citation needed] Another factor was a change in the 
Orioles' flagship radio station: After 22 years on WBAL, the games were 
now on WFBR, a smaller, hipper station with a younger audience. The team 
had won 90 games and drawn 1.05 million fans in 1978, maintaining a depressing 
attendance level that hadn't changed in 25 years.[citation needed] With 
player salaries rising and profits falling, Hoffberger was under pressure 
from his family to sell. He announced in 1978 that he would entertain offers, 
and Williams's purchase was completed in August '79. The lawyer said he 
would move to Washington only if attendance continued to disappoint, although 
crowds had already begun to swell earlier in the season, before Williams 
laid down his challenge.[citation needed] The '79 Orioles didn't have a 
high payroll, but they won with a blend of intelligence, strong fundamentals, 
and guile. An amalagam of All-Stars and role players who jelled under Weaver's 
forceful hand, they pitched well, made key plays in the field, hit in the 
clutch, came from behind, and won games in unusual ways. The phenomenon 
was given a nickname: "Oriole Magic".[citation needed] Those carrying the 
heaviest loads on offense were outfielder Ken Singleton, who had a career-best 
year with 35 homers and 111 RBIs and finished second in the American League 
MVP voting and first baseman Eddie Murray, who had 25 homers and 99 RBI. 
Rich Dauer, Kiko Garcia, and Doug DeCinces filled out the infield, with 
Garcia, a farm-system product, taking over for aging Mark Belanger at shortstop. 
Al Bumbry batted leadoff, stole 37 bases, and ran down balls in center 
field. Rick Dempsey hit just .239, but his get-dirty style behind the plate 
made him a fan favorite. Weaver's idea of platooning veteran John Lowenstein 
and rookie Gary Roenicke in left field was surprisingly successful. Roenicke, 
acquired in the Montreal deal, had 25 homers and 64 RBI in his first full 
season in the majors. Lowenstein, acquired from the Texas Rangers on waivers 
after the '78 season, added 11 homers and 34 RBIs. Weaver also found places 
to plug in reserve outfielder Pat Kelly, who batted .288; pinch hitter 
deluxe Terry Crowley, who batted .317, and Benny Ayala, a reserve outfielder 
with a knack for extra-base hits. Lee May still received the majority of 
the designated hitter at-bats, producing 19 homers and 69 RBIs. Pitching 
was still the heart of the club. The Orioles had the AL's lowest team ERA 
(3.28, more than a half run lower than the next best team ERA) and limited 
opponents to a .241 average, the league's lowest by 12 points. The staff 
was led by Mike Flanagan, whose 23-9 record, 3.08 ERA, and 16 complete 
games earned him the AL Cy Young Award. After Flanagan, there was Dennis 
Martínez (15-16, 18 complete games), Scott McGregor (13-6), Steve Stone 
(11-7), and Jim Palmer (10-6), who was injured and failed to win 20 games 
for only the second time in the '70s. The bullpen, with Don Stanhouse, 
left-hander Tippy Martinez, and right-handers Tim Stoddard and Sammy Stewart, 
had 28 wins and 30 saves. Stanhouse, a closer acquired in a six-player 
deal with the Montreal Expos before the 1978 season, made the AL All-Star 
team despite a habit of narrowly escaping jams. Weaver nicknamed Stanhouse 
"Full Pack", as in the full pack of cigarettes Weaver nervously smoked 
to help him get through Stanhouse's appearances.[citation needed] Flanagan 
called Stanhouse "Stan the Man Unusual,"[5] a play on the nickname of Hall 
of Famer Stan "The Man" Musial. In section 34 in the upper deck down the 
right-field line, a bearded cab driver named "Wild" Bill Hagy became the 
symbol of the awakening. He would rise from his seat, stand in front of 
his section, and spell out O-R-I-O-L-E-S with his body, twisting his arms 
and legs into recognizable facsimiles of the letters. When other, nearby 
sections joined in the cheer, it grew in popularity until the entire ballpark 
was following Hagy's lead, sending roaring cheers into the night.[citation
