NPB Kei Igawa (井川 慶, Igawa Kei?, born July 13, 1979) is a Japanese left-handed 
starting pitcher who is currently a free agent. originally from Ōarai, 
Ibaraki, Japan. He played for the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional 
Baseball from 1999 to 2006. He led all pitchers in the Central League for 
strikeouts in 2002, 2004 and 2006. He also played in the 2006 Major League 
Baseball Japan All-Star Series. He was the number two draft choice of the 
Hanshin Tigers in 1998. After a couple of years in the Hanshin minor league 
system, Igawa entered the starting rotation in 2001. In his first full 
season as a starter, Igawa went 9-13 for the last-placed Tigers, but finished 
with a Central League second-best 2.67 ERA, behind only Chunichi's Shigeki 
Noguchi. In 2002, Hanshin improved to fourth and Igawa's record was 14-9. 
He finished third in ERA (2.49), trailing Masumi Kuwata and Kenshin Kawakami. 
He also led the Central League with 206 strikeouts. In 2003, the Tigers 
won the Central League pennant. Igawa made a great contribution with his 
brilliant performance. He pitched very well and finished with a 20–5 record, 
a 2.80 ERA, and was third with 179 strikeouts. He was named to the Best 
Nine, won the MVP in the Central League and also won the Eiji Sawamura 
Award, the Japanese equivalent of the MLB Cy Young Award.[1] Igawa saw 
a decline in performance in 2004 and 2005. In 2004, despite leading the 
league at 228 strikeouts, he went 14-11 with a 3.73 ERA. In 2005, Igawa 
went 13-9 with a 3.86 ERA, fifth among his team's starters in ERA, and 
was briefly exiled to the minors. He was only tied for fifth in strikeouts 
(down significantly to 145) and 10th in ERA, but was still third in the 
circuit in victories. While still a productive hurler, Igawa became a target 
of enthusiastic fan criticism due to his inability to perform at his prior 
level.[citation needed] In 2006, Igawa announced his intention to play 
in North America. On November 16, 2006, Igawa was posted by the Hanshin 
Tigers. On November 29, 2006, it was announced that the New York Yankees 
were the highest bidders at $26,000,194, with the last three digits representing 
his strikeout total for the 2006 season. He signed a five-year, $20 million 
contract on December 27, 2006. On January 8, 2007, Igawa was officially 
announced at a Yankee Stadium press conference. On April 7, 2007, he made 
his major league debut, allowing 7 earned runs in five innings, but received 
a no decision because of Alex Rodriguez's walk-off grand slam. Igawa later 
earned wins in relief appearances against the Cleveland Indians and Boston 
Red Sox. Igawa came to prominence in a game on April 28, in which starting 
pitcher Jeff Karstens left in the first inning after suffering a broken 
leg on a liner back to the mound. Igawa came in from the bullpen and pitched 
six innings of scoreless relief, allowing only two hits and striking out 
six batters before enjoying a standing ovation on his way to the dugout. 
He was the winning pitcher in the Yankees' 3-1 victory over their rival 
Boston Red Sox.[2][3] However, the Yankees later saw flaws in his mechanics 
and, on May 7, optioned him to the Florida State League's Tampa Yankees 
to work with Nardi Contreras and Billy Connors. Igawa apparently made progress 
in mechanics and location at Tampa, and was subsequently called up to pitch 
for the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre Yankees. Igawa made his return start 
against the San Francisco Giants on June 22, 2007, allowing two earned 
runs in 4.2 innings. On July 27, 2007, Igawa was demoted to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. 
He was claimed on waivers by the San Diego Padres in August 2007,[4][5] 
but the Yankees pulled him back without making a trade.[6] Igawa returned 
to the Yankees in September 2007 when rosters expanded.[citation needed] 
After failing to make the team out of spring training, Igawa started the 
year with Scranton/Wilkes Barre. He was called up to replace Ian Kennedy,[7] 
In Igawa's first MLB start of the 2008 season, he gave up eleven hits and 
six runs in 3 innings.[8] He was promoted again in June for one appearance 
before being optioned back to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre the next day.[9] On 
July 26, 2008, Igawa cleared waivers and was removed from the 40-man roster.[10] 
In 2009, Igawa was invited to Spring training as a non-roster invitee, 
the only Yankee with a guaranteed contract in that position. On March 23, 
2009, the Yankees reassigned Igawa to minor league camp.[11] With the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
Yankees, Igawa posted a 10–8 record with a 4.15 ERA, with 105 strikeouts. 
The 10 wins, 105 strikeouts, and the 4.15 ERA were team bests for the 2009 
year.[12] On July 27, 2009, Igawa set a Scranton/Wilkes-Barre franchise 
record for most career wins, with a 2-1 victory over the Columbus Clippers.[13] 
During the 2008 and 2009 seasons, Yankee General Manager Brian Cashman 
twice attempted to sell Igawa to a Japanese team, but Igawa refused to 
return to Japan both times.[6] In 2010, Igawa was invited to spring training 
as a non-roster invitee. However, on March 13 Igawa was once again cut 
and sent to AAA.[14] In 2011 Igawa played most of the season for the Yankees' 
AA affiliate, the Trenton Thunder, but did pitch four games in AAA for 
the Scranton/Wilkes Barre Yankees where he went 1-0 with a 2.78 ERA. Igawa 
had stated that he preferred to stay in the United States to play in MLB 
after his contract with the Yankees expired.[15] Igawa became a free agent 
after the 2011 season. The Orix Buffaloes of NPB signed Igawa to a two-year 
contract worth ¥200M prior to the 2012 season.[16] Igawa's fastball will 
usually stay in the 87-90 mph range, but he is able to reach back and throw 
harder when in need of a strikeout (tops out at 93 mph).[17] Igawa also 
throws a changeup, which hovers in the 78-81 mph range, and a slider, which 
he uses primarily against left-handed batters. His changeup has a tendency 
to be belt-high and in the middle of the plate. This pitch drew a lot of 
swings and misses in Japan, but it did not have the same success in America. 
Igawa was known to possess above-average control in Japan, but has a very 
poor track record of control at the Major League level.[17] Igawa is also 
known for his unique follow-through, in which he throws his left leg into 
the air and return his pitching arm to a high position. Since he does not 
do this with his off-speed pitches as often as his fastballs, it might 
become easier for batters to distinguish whether a pitch is off-speed or 
not. His record during day games in Japan was 4-5, 7.09 ERA. Considering 
the fact that Igawa pitches exceptionally better in night games, he wears 
sunglasses during day games to make the game environment closer to that 
of a night game. In February 2007, Igawa announced on his Japanese blog 
that he had married recently. His wife and children visit New York for 
a couple months per year.[6] Igawa enjoys playing shogi. In January, 2007, 
the Japanese Shogi Association appointed Igawa as the "shogi goodwill ambassador" 
to popularize shogi outside Japan, and presented the diploma of the first 
grade and the letter of the commission of authority to him. Igawa is a 
great soccer fan, but he joined the baseball club because there was no 
soccer club in his junior high school. Originally, he was a fan of the 
Kashima Antlers, which is based near his hometown of Ibaraki, but he became
