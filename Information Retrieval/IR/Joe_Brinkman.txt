Joseph Norbert Brinkman (born April 9, 1944 in Little Falls, Minnesota) 
is a former umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the American 
League from 1972 to 1999 and throughout both major leagues from 2000 until 
his retirement during the 2006 season. His 35 years of umpiring AL games 
surpassed the record set by Larry Barnett (1968–1999). He is fifth all 
time in number of games worked in the Major Leagues. Three of the four 
ahead of him are in the Hall of Fame. Brinkman umpired in three World Series: 
1978, 1986, 1995. He officiated in three American League Championship Series 
(1976, 1980, 1987, 1992, 1997), and in three All-Star games (1977, 1991, 
1996), calling balls and strikes in 1991. He worked the Division Series 
in 1981, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2004 and 2005. He also officiated in A.J. Burnett's 
no-hitter against the San Diego Padres on May 12, 2001.[1] He served as 
the crew chief for the ALCS in 1976, 1987 and 1997, becoming the fourth 
AL umpire to do so three times, and also for the 2005 NLDS. His retirement 
was announced on August 22, 2006 [1]. Former umpire Bob Davidson returned 
to replace Brinkman on the major league roster. Brinkman was also the crew 
chief for the Pine Tar Game between the Kansas City Royals and New York 
Yankees on July 24, 1983. In that game, George Brett of the Royals hit 
a two-run home run off of Yankees reliever Goose Gossage in the ninth inning, 
but home plate umpire Tim McClelland, after conferring with Brinkman and 
the rest of the crew, found that the pine tar on Brett's bat exceeded the 
allowed limit of 18 inches, and Brett was called out. Brett immediately 
ran out of the dugout toward the umpires, and disputed the call so vehemently 
that Brinkman had to grab him around the neck to keep him from attacking 
McClelland. American League president Lee MacPhail later overturned the 
umpires' ruling upon a protest by the Royals, and the home run was restored. 
However, the game was resumed on August 18, but Brinkman and his crew were 
not present. Brinkman had provided an affidavit stating that Brett and 
baserunner U. L. Washington had touched all the bases, anticipating appeal 
plays by Yankees manager Billy Martin to state that the runners missed 
at least one base. Dave Phillips, the crew chief of the umpiring crew that 
was at Yankee Stadium when the game resumed, showed Martin a copy of the 
affidavit. He wore uniform number 15 from the year the AL adopted uniform 
numbers in 1980, and kept the number when MLB took over supervision of 
a combined umpiring staff in 2000. He was one of the last active umpires 
to have worn the red blazers that were part of the AL's umpiring uniforms 
from 1973 through 1979. (Derryl Cousins was the last remaining umpire to 
have worn the blazer; he retired in 2012.) He likened the red coats to 
making AL umpires look like "a bunch of Captain Kangaroos" in cold weather. 
When he retired, he was the last active umpire to have used the outside 
chest protector, which was required for AL umpires through the 1974 season. 
The league made new umpires wear the inside chest protector starting in 
1977. Brinkman was not the last umpire to wear the "balloon" protector, 
having switched to the inside protector in 1980. Bill Kunkel and Jerry 
Neudecker were the last umpires to use the "balloon" protector. Neither 
made the switch, with Kunkel succumbing to cancer early in the 1985 season, 
and Neudecker retiring after the 1985 season. Brinkman was the last active 
umpire to have worked in the American League prior to the establishment 
of the Designated Hitter for the 1973 season. He came up for three games 
late in the 1972 season, before joining the AL staff full-time in 1973. 
Brinkman ran the Joe Brinkman Umpire's School which he had purchased from 
retired Major League Umpire Bill Kinnamon. He sold this to fellow AL umpire 
Jim Evans in the late 1990s. He was prominent in union affairs for both 
the Major League Umpire's Association and the newly formed World Umpire's 
Association (their first Vice President). Brinkman was the left field umpire 
for Game 5 of the 1995 American League Division Series between the Seattle 
Mariners and the New York Yankees, meaning he was the umpire who officially 
ruled Edgar Martinez's famous double a fair ball. For several years he 
operated the Joe Brinkman Umpire's School in Cocoa, Florida, and has worked 
at several baseball camps and clinics over the years. Brinkman was raised 
in Holdingford, Minnesota and graduated from Holdingford High School.[2]
