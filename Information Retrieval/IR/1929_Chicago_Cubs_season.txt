The 1929 Chicago Cubs season was the 58th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 54th in the National League and the 14th at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished first in the National League with a record of 98â€“54, 10.5 games 
ahead of the second place Pittsburgh Pirates. The team was defeated four 
games to one by the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1929 World Series. Rogers 
Hornsby, who was acquired from the Boston Braves in an offseason deal, 
had a career year, hitting .380. In the process, he hit 39 home runs and 
led the league with a .679 slugging percentage. The 156 runs scored by 
Hornsby in 1929 were the most by a right-handed batter in the National 
League during the 20th century. Hornsby collected his second Most Valuable 
Player award that year, and for the second time he won a National League 
pennant. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Coaches Note: Pos =
