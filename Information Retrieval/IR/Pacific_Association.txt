The Pacific Association of Professional Baseball Clubs is an independent 
baseball league based in Northern California. The league commissioner is 
former Major League Baseball star Mike Marshall. The league was founded 
in 2013 by four former North American League teams.[1] The league features 
a 78-game split-season that runs from June to August. First half winners 
face the second half winner in a one-game playoff (if needed) for the championship. 
The average salary of a Pacific Association player in 2015 was $650 per 
month. During the initial season, two Hawaii-based teams, the Hawaii Stars 
and the Maui Warriors, played inter-league games against the Baseball Challenge 
League of Japan; California teams played against the Freedom Pro League 
of Arizona.[2] Both Hawaii teams, the Stars and the Warriors, ceased operations 
after playing the 2013 season due to the travel costs of bringing in opponents 
from Northern California.[3] East Bay Lumberjacks also did not return for 
a second season. Two expansion clubs were added in 2014 (Sonoma Stompers 
and Pittsburg Mettle) bringing the total number of teams to four. League
