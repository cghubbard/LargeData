James Charles Walsh (September 22, 1885 – July 3, 1962) was an outfielder 
in Major League Baseball who played from 1912 through 1917 for the Philadelphia 
Athletics (1912–13, 1914–16), New York Yankees (1914) and Boston Red Sox 
(1916–17). Walsh batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He was born 
in Kallila, Ireland. Walsh played in over 1,800 games spanning 13 seasons 
in the International League, hitting better than .300 ten times. He played 
for the Baltimore Orioles from 1910 to 1912, then spent the rest of the 
decade in the American League, appearing in two World Series with the Athletics 
in 1914 and for the World Champions Red Sox in 1916. In a six-season career, 
Walsh was a .232 hitter (410-for-1771) with six home runs and 150 RBI in 
541 games, including 235 runs, 71 doubles, 31 triples, 92 stolen bases, 
and a .330 on-base percentage. In 492 appearances at center field (169), 
right field (165) and left field (162), he posted a collective .964 fielding

career, Walsh returned to the International League, playing on two pennant 
winners in Baltimore. Twice he led the league with a .357 average in 1925 
and a .388 average in 1926 at the age of 41, also driving in 131 runs.
