Raymond Roger Miller (born April 30, 1945 at Takoma Park, Maryland) is 
a former coach and manager in American Major League Baseball. A highly 
respected pitching coach, he had two short terms as a manager—with the 
Minnesota Twins (1985–86) and the Baltimore Orioles (1998–99)—compiling 
a record of 266–297 (.472). A right-handed pitcher, Miller attended high 
school in Suitland, Maryland, and was named all-state in baseball in 1963, 
his senior year. He signed his first professional contract with the San 
Francisco Giants in 1964, then was acquired by the Cleveland Indians farm 
system the following season. Despite winning 16 games with Reno of the 
Class A California League in 1968, Miller never reached the Major Leagues 
as a player, although he made it to Class AAA with Portland of the Pacific 
Coast League, Wichita of the American Association and Rochester of the 
International League from 1969–73. In his final season at Rochester, he 
was a player-coach, and then became minor league pitching instructor for 
the Red Wings' parent club, the Orioles, from 1974–77. At the close of 
the 1977 season, Miller agreed to join the coaching staff of the Texas 
Rangers, whose manager was former Baltimore third-base coach Billy Hunter. 
But in January 1978, the Orioles' pitching coach position opened unexpectedly 
when George Bamberger was named skipper of the Milwaukee Brewers. Miller 
was let out of his Ranger contract and succeeded Bamberger as mound tutor 
of the pennant-contending Orioles. He worked under managers Earl Weaver 
and Joe Altobelli and coached for O's teams that won the 1979 American 
League championship and the 1983 world title. Miller tutored 20-game-winning 
pitchers such as Jim Palmer, Mike Boddicker, Mike Flanagan, Steve Stone 
and Scott McGregor during that period. The success of the Orioles' pitching 
staff made Miller a sought-after managerial candidate and on June 21, 1985, 
he received his first opportunity. Billy Gardner, who had led the Twins 
to a disappointing 27–35 record, was fired and Miller took control of the 
young Minnesota ballclub. Although the Twins improved to 50–50 over the 
remainder of the season, they performed so poorly (59–80, .424) in 1986, 
Miller was replaced as skipper by Tom Kelly on September 12. He then returned 
to the coaching ranks, spending ten seasons as pitching mentor of the Pittsburgh 
Pirates (1987–96) working for Jim Leyland and one (1997) back in Baltimore 
under Davey Johnson. When Johnson resigned at the close of the Orioles’ 
AL East Division championship season, Miller replaced him as manager. But 
over two seasons (1998–99), the Orioles played ten games under the .500,[1] 
and he was fired in favor of Mike Hargrove in the autumn of 1999. Miller 
returned as pitching coach of the Orioles in 2004–05 and the Baltimore 
mound staff showed improvement under his tutelage. But Miller was forced 
to the sidelines by successful surgery to repair an aneurysm and was succeeded 
in that role by Leo Mazzone in 2006. Miller's induction into the Baltimore 
Orioles Hall of Fame was announced on March 22, 2010. According to the 
press release from mlb.com: "Miller will be enshrined for his work as a 
pitching coach with the Orioles. He had three stints with the Birds in 
that role—1978–85, 1997 and 2004–05. During Miller's tenure, the Orioles 
won the 1979 American League Championship and the 1983 World Series. Five 
Orioles pitchers won at least 20 games under his tutelage—Mike Boddicker 
(20) in 1984, Scott McGregor (20) and Steve Stone (25) in 1980, Mike Flanagan 
(23) in 1979 and Jim Palmer (21) in 1978. Miller also served as manager 
for the Orioles during the 1998 and 1999 seasons, compiling a 157–167 record."
