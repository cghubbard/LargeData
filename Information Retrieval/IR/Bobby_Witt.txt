Born: (1964-05-11) May 11, 1964 (age 52) Arlington, Virginia High School: 
Canton High School (Massachusetts) Robert Andrew Witt (born May 11, 1964 
in Arlington, Virginia) is a former professional baseball pitcher. He played 
all or part of sixteen seasons in Major League Baseball for the Texas Rangers, 
Oakland Athletics, Florida Marlins, St. Louis Cardinals, Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays, Cleveland Indians, and Arizona Diamondbacks. Bobby was drafted out 
of the University of Oklahoma with the third pick of the first round by 
the Texas Rangers in 1985. His first professional win came in 1986 with 
the Texas Rangers as he had failed to win a game in the minor leagues. 
He was known as a hard-throwing right-hander with control problems throughout 
his career and many in Arlington began to call him "Witt 'n Wild" as a 
play on the waterpark Wet 'n Wild, which was located next to Arlington 
Stadium.[citation needed] Bobby made his major league debut in 1986 and 
made 31 starts for the Rangers, finishing the season with an 11-9 record. 
Known for his control problems, he led the league with 143 walks in 157.2 
innings pitched. The following season he led the league again in walks, 
this time with 140 in 143 innings. On August 2, 1987, Bobby struck out 
4 batters in one inning.[1] He set the Texas Rangers club record set in 
1990 with his 7th consecutive road win of the season, a feat that was not 
matched by a Rangers pitcher until Scott Feldman did it in 2009.[2][3] 
In 1990, he had the best season of his career, going 17-10 with a 3.36 
ERA, the lowest of his career. He also established dominance, striking 
out over 220 batters in 222 innings. He would continue on pitching for 
the Rangers till 1992 season, when he was traded to division rival Oakland. 
From 1992–1994, Bobby compiled a 23-24 record with the A's. On June 23, 
1994, as a member of the Oakland A's, he lost his bid for a perfect game 
when first base umpire Gary Cederstrom called the Kansas City Royals' Greg 
Gagne safe in the 6th inning [2] on a close play at first base on a bunt. 
Replays showed that Gagne was out.[4] Witt went on to complete the game 
with only that one hit allowed and no walks. During the 1995 season, Bobby 
pitched half a season with the Marlins before being traded to Texas. He 
finished his tenure with Florida with a 2-7 record despite having an ERA 
of 3.90 and a WHIP of under 1.40. From 1995–1998, Bobby had a 36-32 record 
with Texas. His best season during this timeframe was in 1996, when he 
finished with a 16-12 record despite having an ERA of over 5.00 (5.41). 
On June 30, 1997, he became the first American League pitcher to hit a 
home run since Roric Harrison on October 3, 1972.[5][6] His blast was against 
off Ismael Valdes of the Los Angeles Dodgers in an interleague contest 
in the top of the 6th inning. The bat with which he hit this home run is 
now in the Baseball Hall of Fame.[7] During the 1998 season, Bobby was 
traded to St.Louis. He pitched with the Cardinals in 17 games, only 5 as 
a starter. Bobby had one of his worst seasons of his career, going 7-15 
with a 5.82 ERA in 32 starts for the Devil Rays. Due to injury, Bobby was 
limited to just 7 appearances with the Indians, having pitched only 15 
innings for the Tribe. In his last season in the Majors, Bobby pitched 
in 14 games for the D'Backs, 7 as a starter and finished with a 4-1 record 
for the World Series Champion Diamondbacks. After the season, Witt retired 
from baseball. Bobby led the league in walks three times and wild pitches 
twice. Witt retired in 2001 after winning a World Series ring with the 
Arizona Diamondbacks. His career record is 142–157 with an ERA of 4.83. 
As of April 2015, Witt lives in Colleyville, Texas with his wife and 4 
children and is now a player agent. His son committed to play college baseball.[8]
