The 1987 Minnesota Twins won the World Series for the first time since 
moving from Washington in 1961, marking the second time that the franchise 
had won the World Series. (The Washington Senators had won it in 1924.) 
Manager Tom Kelly managed the rare feat of winning the World Series in 
his first full season as manager. The Twins were 85-77, first in the American 
League West. The team had one of the lowest winning percentages ever for 
a World Series champion, at .525. They also had the remarkably bad road 
record of 29-52 (.358 percentage) but made up for it winning 56 home games 
(best in MLB). Fortunately for the Twins, they played in a very weak division; 
only two teams finished above .500 and only 10 games separated the Twins 
from the last-place California Angels and Texas Rangers. 1987 was the first 
year the Twins started using their modernized logos and uniforms, which 
are still in use today. Only one Twin made the All-Star Game, outfielder 
Kirby Puckett. The highest paid player was Kent Hrbek at $1,310,000; followed 
by Bert Blyleven at $1,150,000. Over a late August weekend at Milwaukee, 
Puckett went 10 for 11, with four homers and two doubles, raising his batting 
average 13 points. The feat tied a major league record. Joe Niekro, a pitcher 
for the Twins, was suspended for 10 games when umpire Tim Tschida discovered 
an emery board in his pocket. Tschida suspected Niekro was scuffing the 
ball, and saw the emery board fly out of Niekro's pocket. Niekro said he 
was filing his nails in the dugout, but American League president Dr. Bobby 
Brown didn't believe him, and ordered the suspension. When the Twins won 
the pennant, Niekro set a major league record as he'd waited 20Â½ years 
since his debut to reach a World Series game. 2,081,976 fans attended Twins 
games, the sixth highest total in the American League. The Homer Hanky 
was introduced in 1987's pennant drive. When the Twins made the playoffs 
for the first time since 1970, three members of that team remained with 
the club now seventeen years later. Bert Blyleven was the only remaining 
player; Tony Oliva became the hitting coach and Rick Renick the third base 
coach. This was the last year for a long time that the Twins were stocked 
with power hitters. In particular, Kirby Puckett, Kent Hrbek, Gary Gaetti, 
and Tom Brunansky combined to hit 125 home runs. (The team as a whole hit 
196.) Hrbek, Gaetti, and Brunansky each surpassed 30 home runs, a number 
that no Twin would reach again until Justin Morneau and Torii Hunter in 
2006. Kirby Puckett led the AL with 207 hits. Despite the power in their 
lineup, the Twins were outscored 806-786, one of the largest such differentials 
for a World Series champion. The top three starting pitchers, Frank Viola, 
Bert Blyleven, and Les Straker provided stability throughout the year. 
Mike Smithson, Joe Niekro, and Jeff Bittiger were less reliable. Newly 
acquired closer Jeff Reardon was a reliable option at the end of games. 
Juan Berenguer was the most reliable set-up man, posting a 3.94 ERA. Bert 
Blyleven led the AL with 46 home runs allowed. The defense was not as strong 
as would be typical for Twins teams under manager Tom Kelly. Hrbek was 
the most reliable fielder at first base, and the outfield of Dan Gladden, 
Puckett, and Brunansky was reliable. Third baseman Gary Gaetti and center 
fielder Kirby Puckett each won their second Gold Glove Award. [1] [2] [3]

two post-season at-bats. The Twins won all four home games to top the St.
