The Minnesota Twins are an American professional baseball team based in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Twins compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division. The team 
is named after the Twin Cities area comprising Minneapolis and St. Paul. 
They played in Metropolitan Stadium from 1961 to 1981 and the Hubert H. 
Humphrey Metrodome from 1982 to 2009. They played their inaugural game 
at the newly completed Target Field on April 12, 2010.[7] The team was 
founded in Washington, D.C. in 1901 as one of the eight original teams 
of the American League, named the Washington Senators or Washington Nationals. 
Although the Washington team endured long bouts of mediocrity (immortalized 
in the 1955 Broadway musical Damn Yankees),[8] they had a period of prolonged 
success in the 1920s and 1930s, led by Baseball Hall of Fame members Bucky 
Harris, Goose Goslin, Sam Rice, Heinie Manush, Joe Cronin, and above all 
Walter Johnson.[9] Manager Clark Griffith joined the team in 1912 and became 
the team's owner in 1920.[10] The franchise remained under Griffith family 
ownership until 1984.[11] In 1960, Major League Baseball granted the city 
of Minneapolis an expansion team. Washington owner Calvin Griffith, Clark's 
nephew and adopted son, requested that he be allowed to move his team to 
Minneapolis and instead give Washington the expansion team. Upon league 
approval, the team moved to Minnesota after the 1960 season, setting up 
shop in Metropolitan Stadium, while Washington fielded a brand new "Washington 
Senators" (which later became the Texas Rangers prior to the 1972 season).[12] 
Success came quickly to the team in Minnesota. Sluggers Harmon Killebrew[13] 
and Bob Allison, who had already been stars in Washington, were joined 
by Tony Oliva and Zoilo Versalles, and later second baseman Rod Carew[14] 
and pitchers Jim Kaat and Jim Perry, winning the American League pennant 
in 1965.[15] A second wave of success came in the late 1980s and early 
1990s under manager Tom Kelly, led by Kent Hrbek, Bert Blyleven,[16] Frank 
Viola, and Kirby Puckett,[17] winning the franchise's second and third 
World Series (and first in Minnesota).[18] Through the 2015 season, the 
franchise has won three World Series championships (1924, 1987, and 1991), 
and has fielded 18 American League batting champions.[19][20] The Washington 
Senators spent the first decade of their existence finishing near the bottom 
of the American League standings. Their fortunes began to improve with 
the arrival of 19-year-old pitcher, Walter Johnson, in 1907. Johnson blossomed 
in 1911 with 25 victories, although the Senators still finished the season 
in seventh place.[21] In 1912, the Senators improved dramatically, as their 
pitching staff led the league in team earned run average and in strikeouts. 
Johnson won 33 games while teammate Bob Groom added another 24 wins to 
help the Senators finish the season in second place.[22] The Senators continued 
to perform respectably in 1913 with Johnson posting a career-high 35 victories, 
as the team once again finished in second place.[23] The Senators then 
fell into another period of decline for the next decade. After a string 
of mediocre seasons, a rejuvenated Johnson rebounded in 1924 to win 23 
games with the help of his catcher, Muddy Ruel, as the Senators won the 
American League pennant for the first time in the history of the franchise.[24] 
The Senators faced John McGraw's heavily favored New York Giants in the 
1924 World Series.[25] The two teams traded wins back and forth until the 
series reached the seventh and deciding game. The Senators trailed the 
Giants 3 to 1 in the eighth inning of Game 7, when Bucky Harris hit a routine 
ground ball to third which hit a pebble and took a bad hop over Giants 
third baseman Freddie Lindstrom. Two runners scored on the play, tying 
the score at three.[26] An aging Walter Johnson then came in to pitch the 
ninth inning, and held the Giants scoreless into extra innings. In the 
bottom of the twelfth inning with Ruel at bat, he hit a high, foul ball 
directly over home plate.[27] The Giants' catcher, Hank Gowdy, dropped 
his protective mask to field the ball but, failing to toss the mask aside, 
stumbled over it and dropped the ball, thus giving Ruel another chance 
to bat.[27] On the next pitch, Ruel hit a double and proceeded to score 
the winning run when Earl McNeely hit a ground ball that took another bad 
hop over Lindstrom's head.[26][27] This would mark the only World Series 
triumph for the franchise during their 60-year tenure in Washington. The 
following season they repeated as American League champions but ultimately 
lost the 1925 World Series to the Pittsburgh Pirates. After Walter Johnson's 
retirement in 1927, he was hired as manager of the Senators. After enduring 
a few losing seasons, the team returned to contention in 1930. In 1933, 
Senators owner Clark Griffith returned to the formula that worked for him 
nine years prior: 26-year-old shortstop Joe Cronin became player-manager. 
The Senators posted a 99–53 record and cruised to the pennant seven games 
ahead of the New York Yankees, but in the 1933 World Series the Giants 
exacted their revenge winning in five games. Following the loss, the Senators 
sank all the way to seventh place in 1934 and attendance began to fall. 
Despite the return of Harris as manager from 1935–42 and again from 1950–54, 
Washington was mostly a losing ball club for the next 25 years contending 
for the pennant only during World War II. Washington came to be known as 
"first in war, first in peace, and last in the American League",[28] with 
their hard luck being crucial to the plot of the musical and film Damn 
Yankees. Cecil Travis, Buddy Myer (1935 A.L. batting champion), Roy Sievers, 
Mickey Vernon (batting champion in 1946 and 1953), and Eddie Yost were 
notable Senators players whose careers were spent in obscurity due to the 
team's lack of success.[29][30] In 1954, the Senators signed future Hall 
of Fame member Harmon Killebrew. By 1959 he was the Senators’ regular third 
baseman and led the league with 42 home runs earning him a starting spot 
on the American League All-Star team. After Griffith's death in 1955, his 
nephew and adopted son Calvin took over the team presidency. Calvin sold 
Griffith Stadium to the city of Washington and leased it back leading to 
speculation that the team was planning to move as the Boston Braves, St. 
Louis Browns and Philadelphia Athletics had all done in the early 1950s. 
By 1957, after an early flirtation with San Francisco (where the New York 
Giants would eventually move after that season ended), Griffith began courting 
Minneapolis–St. Paul, a prolonged process that resulted in his rejecting 
the Twin Cities' first offer[31] before agreeing to relocate. The American 
League opposed the move at first, but in 1960 a deal was reached: The Senators 
would move and would be replaced with an expansion Senators team for 1961. 
Thus, the old Washington Senators became the Minnesota Twins. The Washington 
franchise was known as both "Senators" and "Nationals" at various times, 
and sometimes at the same time. In 1905, the team changed its official 
name to the "Washington Nationals."[32] The name "Nationals" appeared on 
uniforms for only two seasons, and was then replaced with the "W" logo 
for the next 52 years. The media often shortened the nickname to "Nats." 
Many fans and newspapers (especially out-of-town papers) persisted in using 
the "Senators" nickname, because of potential confusion caused by an American 
League team using the "Nationals" name. Over time, "Nationals" faded as 
a nickname, and "Senators" became dominant. Baseball guides listed the 
club's nickname as "Nationals or Senators", acknowledging the dual-nickname 
situation. The team name was officially changed to Washington Senators 
around the time of Clark Griffith's death. It was not until 1959 that the 
word "Senators" first appeared on team shirts. "Nats" continued to be used 
by space-saving headline writers, even for the 1961 expansion team, which 
was never officially known as "Nationals." The current "Nationals" and 
"Nats" names were revived in 2005, when the Montreal Expos relocated to 
Washington to become the Nationals. The name "Twins" was derived from the 
popular name of the region, the Twin Cities. The NBA's Minneapolis Lakers 
had re-located to Los Angeles in 1960 due to poor attendance which was 
believed to have been caused in part by the reluctance of fans in St. Paul 
to support the team.[33] Griffith was determined not to alienate fans in 
either city by naming the team after one city or the other, so his desire 
was to name the team the "Twin Cities Twins",[33] however MLB objected. 
Griffith therefore named the team the Minnesota Twins. However, the team 
was allowed to keep its original "TC" (for Twin Cities) insignia for its 
caps. The team's logo shows two men, one in a Minneapolis Millers uniform 
and one in a St. Paul Saints uniform, shaking hands across the Mississippi 
River. The "TC" remained on the Twins' caps until 1987, when they adopted 
their current uniforms. By this time, the team felt it was established 
enough to put an "M" on its cap without having St. Paul fans think it stood 
for Minneapolis. The "TC" logo was moved to a sleeve on the jerseys, and 
occasionally appeared as an alternate cap design.[34] Both the "TC" and 
"Minnie & Paul" logos remain the team's primary insignia. As of 2010, the 
"TC" logo has been reinstated on the cap as their logo.[35] The Twins were 
eagerly greeted in Minnesota when they arrived in 1961. They brought a 
nucleus of talented players: Harmon Killebrew, Bob Allison, Camilo Pascual, 
Zoilo Versalles, Jim Kaat, Earl Battey, and Lenny Green. Tony Oliva, who 
would go on to win American League batting championships in 1964, 1965 
and 1971, made his major league debut in 1962. That year, the Twins won 
91 games, the most by the franchise since 1933. Behind Mudcat Grant's 21 
victories, Versalles' A.L. MVP season and Oliva's batting title, the Twins 
won 102 games and the American League Pennant in 1965, but they were defeated 
in the World Series by the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games (behind the 
Series MVP, Sandy Koufax, who compiled a 2–1 record, including winning 
the seventh game).[36] Heading into the final weekend of the 1967 season, 
when Rod Carew was named the A.L. Rookie of the Year, the Twins, Boston 
Red Sox, Chicago White Sox, and Detroit Tigers all had a shot at clinching 
the American League championship. The Twins and the Red Sox started the 
weekend tied for 1st place and played against each other in Boston for 
the final three games of the season. The Red Sox won two out of the three 
games, seizing their first pennant since 1946 with a 92–70 record. The 
Twins and Tigers both finished one game back, with 91–71 records, while 
the White Sox finished three games back, at 89–73. In 1969, the new manager 
of the Twins, Billy Martin, pushed aggressive base running all-around, 
and Carew set the all-time Major League record by stealing home seven times 
in addition to winning the first of seven A.L. batting championships.[37] 
With Killebrew slugging 49 homers and winning the AL MVP Award, these 1969 
Twins won the very first American League Western Division Championship, 
but they lost three straight games to the Baltimore Orioles, winners of 
109 games, in the first American League Championship Series. The Orioles 
would go on to be upset by the New York Mets in the World Series. Martin 
was fired after the season following an August 1969 fight in Detroit with 
20-game winner Dave Boswell and outfielder Bob Allison, in an alley outside 
the Lindell A.C. bar. However Bill Rigney led the Twins to a repeat division 
title in 1970, behind the star pitching of Jim Perry (24-12), the A.L. 
Cy Young Award winner, while the Orioles again won the Eastern Division 
Championship behind the star pitching of Jim Palmer. Once again, the Orioles 
won the A.L. Championship Series in a three-game sweep,[38] and this time 
they would win the World Series. After winning the division again in 1970, 
the team entered an eight-year dry spell, finishing around the .500 mark. 
Killebrew departed after 1974. Owner Calvin Griffith faced financial difficulty 
with the start of free agency, costing the Twins the services of Lyman 
Bostock and Larry Hisle, who left as free agents after the 1977 season, 
and Carew, who was traded after the 1978 season.[39] In 1975, Carew won 
his fourth consecutive AL batting title,[40] having already joined Ty Cobb 
as the only players to lead the major leagues in batting average for three 
consecutive seasons. In 1977, Carew batted .388, which was the highest 
in baseball since Boston's Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941; he won the 1977 
AL MVP Award. He won another batting title in 1978, hitting .333.[40] In 
1982, the Twins moved into the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, which they 
shared with the Minnesota Vikings. After a 16-54 start, the Twins were 
on the verge on becoming the worst team in MLB history. They turned the 
season around somewhat, but still lost 102 games which is the worst record 
in Twins history, despite the .301 average, 23 homers and 92 RBI from rookie 
Kent Hrbek.[41] In 1984, Griffith sold the Twins to multi-billionaire banker/financier 
Carl Pohlad. The Metrodome hosted the 1985 Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game. After several losing seasons, the 1987 team, led by Hrbek, Gary Gaetti, 
Frank Viola (A.L. Cy Young winner in 1988), Bert Blyleven, Jeff Reardon, 
Tom Brunansky, Dan Gladden, and rising star Kirby Puckett, returned to 
the World Series after defeating the favored Detroit Tigers in the ALCS, 
4 games to 1. Tom Kelly managed the Twins to World Series victories over 
the St. Louis Cardinals in 1987[42][43] and the Atlanta Braves in 1991.[44] 
The 1988 Twins were the first team in American League history to draw more 
than 3 million fans.[45] Twins' pitcher and Minnesota native Jack Morris 
was the star of the series in 1991, going 2–0 in his three starts with 
a 1.17 ERA.[46] 1991 also marked the first time that any team that finished 
in last place in their division would advance to the World Series the following 
season; both the Twins and the Braves did this in 1991.[47] Contributors 
to the 1991 Twins' improvement from 74 wins to 95 included Chuck Knoblauch, 
the A.L. Rookie of the Year; Scott Erickson, 20-game winner; new closer 
Rick Aguilera and new designated hitter Chili Davis. The World Series in 
1991 is regarded by many as one of the classics of all time. In this Series, 
four games were won during the teams' final at-bat, and three of these 
were in extra innings. The Atlanta Braves won all three of their games 
in Atlanta, and the Twins won all four of their games in Minnesota. The 
sixth game was a legendary one for Puckett, who tripled in a run, made 
a sensational leaping catch against the wall, and finally in the 11th inning 
hit the game-winning home run. The seventh game was tied 0–0 after the 
regulation nine innings, and marked only the second time that the seventh 
game of the World Series had ever gone into extra innings. The Twins won 
on a walk-off RBI single by Gene Larkin in the bottom of the 10th inning, 
after Morris had pitched ten shutout innings against the Braves.[48] The 
seventh game of the 1991 World Series is widely regarded as one of the 
greatest games in the history of professional baseball.[49][50][51] After 
a winning season in 1992 but falling short of Oakland in the division, 
the Twins fell into a years-long stretch of mediocrity, posting a losing 
record each season for the next eight: 71–91 in 1993, 50–63 in 1994, 56–88 
in 1995, 78–84 in 1996, 68–94 in 1997, 70–92 in 1998, 63–97 in 1999 and 
69–93 in 2000. From 1994 to 1997, a long sequence of retirements and injuries 
hurt the team badly, and Tom Kelly spent the remainder of his managerial 
career attempting to rebuild the Twins. In 1997, owner Carl Pohlad almost 
sold the Twins to North Carolina businessman Don Beaver, who would have 
moved the team to the Piedmont Triad area.[52] Puckett after the 1995 season 
was forced to retire at age 35 due to loss of vision in one eye from a 
central retinal vein occlusion.[53] The 1989 A.L. batting champion, he 
retired as the Twins' all-time leader in career hits, runs, doubles, and 
total bases. At the time of his retirement, his .318 career batting average 
was the highest by any right-handed American League batter since Joe DiMaggio. 
Puckett was the fourth baseball player during the 20th century to record 
1,000 hits in his first five full calendar years in Major League Baseball, 
and was the second to record 2,000 hits during his first 10 full calendar 
years. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001, his first year 
of eligibility. The Twins dominated the Central Division in the first decade 
of the new century, winning the division in six of those ten years ('02, 
'03, '04, '06, '09 and '10), and nearly winning it in '08 as well. From 
2001 to 2006, the Twins compiled the longest streak of consecutive winning 
seasons since moving to Minnesota. Threatened with closure by league contraction,[54] 
the 2002 team battled back to reach the American League Championship Series 
before being eliminated 4–1 by that year's World Series champion Anaheim 
Angels. In 2006, the Twins won the division on the last day of the regular 
season (the only day all season they held sole possession of first place) 
but lost to the Oakland Athletics in the ALDS. Ozzie Guillén coined a nickname 
for this squad, calling the Twins "little piranhas".[55] The Twins players 
embraced the label, and in response, the Twins Front office started a "Piranha 
Night", with piranha finger puppets given out to the first 10,000 fans. 
Scoreboard operators sometimes played an animated sequence of piranhas 
munching under that caption in situations where the Twins were scoring 
runs playing "small ball", and the stadium vendors sold T-shirts and hats 
advertising "The Little Piranhas". The Twins also had the AL MVP in Justin 
Morneau,[56] the AL batting champion in Joe Mauer,[55] and the AL Cy Young 
Award winner in Johan Santana.[57] In 2008, the Twins finished the regular 
season tied with the White Sox on top of the AL Central, forcing a one-game 
playoff in Chicago to determine the division champion.[58] The Twins lost 
that game and missed the playoffs. The game location was determined by 
rule of a coin flip that was conducted in mid-September. This rule was 
changed for the start of the 2009 season, making the site for any tiebreaker 
game to be determined by the winner of the regular season head-to-head 
record between the teams involved.[59] After a mediocre year where the 
Twins played .500 baseball for most of the season, the team won 17 of their 
last 21 games to tie the Detroit Tigers for the lead in the Central Division.[60] 
The Twins were able to use the play-in game rule to their advantage when 
they won the AL Central at the end of the regular season by way of a 6–5 
tiebreaker game that concluded with a 12th-inning walk-off hit by Alexi 
Casilla.[61] However, they failed to advance to the American League Championship 
Series as they lost the American League Divisional Series in three straight 
games to the eventual World Series champion New York Yankees.[62] That 
year, Joe Mauer became only the second catcher in 33 years to win the AL 
MVP award.[63] Iván Rodríguez won for the Texas Rangers in 1999, previous 
to that, the last catcher to win an AL MVP was the New York Yankees Thurman 
Munson in 1976.[64] In their inaugural season played at Target Field, the 
Twins finished the regular season with a record of 94-68, clinching the 
AL Central Division title for the 6th time in 9 years under manager Ron 
Gardenhire. New regular players included rookie Danny Valencia at third 
base, designated hitter Jim Thome,[65] closer Matt Capps,[66] infielder 
J. J. Hardy,[67] and infielder Orlando Hudson.[68] In relief pitching roles 
were late additions Brian Fuentes and Randy Flores. On July 7, the team 
suffered a major blow when Justin Morneau sustained a concussion, which 
knocked him out for the rest of the season. In the divisional series, the 
Twins lost to the Yankees in a three-game sweep for the second consecutive 
year.[69] Following the season, Ron Gardenhire received AL Manager of the 
Year honors after finishing as a runner up in several prior years.[70] 
After repeating as AL Central champions in 2010, the Twins entered 2011 
with no players on the disabled list, and the team seemed poised for another 
strong season. During the off-season, the team signed Japanese shortstop 
Tsuyoshi Nishioka to fill a hole in the middle infield, re-signed Jim Thome, 
who was in pursuit of career home run number 600, and also re-signed Carl 
Pavano. However, the season was largely derailed by an extensive list of 
injuries. Nishioka's broken leg in a collision at second base[71] led the 
way and was followed by DL stints from Kevin Slowey, Joe Mauer, Jason Repko, 
Thome, Delmon Young (two stints on the DL), José Mijares, Glen Perkins, 
Joe Nathan, Francisco Liriano, Jason Kubel, Denard Span (two stints), Justin 
Morneau, Scott Baker, and Alexi Casilla. The team's low point was arguably 
on May 1 when the team started 7 players who were batting below .235 in 
a game against Kansas City.[72] From that day forward, the Twins made a 
strong push to get as close as five games back of the division lead by 
the All-Star break. However, the team struggled down the stretch and fell 
back out of contention. The team failed to reach the playoffs for the first 
time since 2008 and experienced their first losing season in four years. 
Despite an AL-worst 63-99 record, the team drew over 3 million fans for 
the second consecutive year.[73] Michael Cuddyer served as the Twins representative 
at the All-Star game, his first appearance.[74] Bert Blyleven's number 
was retired during the season and he was also inducted into the Baseball 
Hall of Fame during the month of July.[75] On August 10, Nathan recorded 
his 255th save, passing Rick Aguilera for first place on the franchise's 
all-time saves list.[76] On August 15, Thome hit 599th and 600th home run 
at Comerica Park to become the eighth player in Major League history to 
hit 600 home runs, joining Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Barry Bonds, 
Sammy Sosa, Ken Griffey, Jr., and Alex Rodriguez.[77] The team started 
the 2012 season with a league worst 10-24 record.[78] In late May and early 
June, the team embarked on a hot streak, winning ten out of thirteen games.[79][80] 
By mid July, the team found themselves only 10 games out of the division 
lead.[81] On July 16, the Twins defeated the Baltimore Orioles 19-7, the 
most runs scored in the short history of Target Field.[82][83] By the end 
of August, the Twins were more than 20 games below .500, and last in the 
American League.[84] On August 29, it was announced that the Twins would 
host the 2014 All-Star Game.[85] In 2013, the Twins finished in 4th place 
in the AL Central, with a record of 66-96.[86] In 2014, the team finished 
with a 70-92 record, last in the division and accumulated the second fewest 
wins in the American League.[87] As a result, Ron Gardenhire was fired 
on September 29, 2014.[88] On November 3, 2014 Paul Molitor was announced 
by the team as the 13th manager in Twins history. In 2015, the team had 
a winning season (83-79), following four consecutive seasons of 90 or more 
losses. The quirks of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, including the turf 
floor and the white roof, gave the Twins a significant home-field advantage 
that played into their winning the World Series in both 1987 and 1991, 
at least in the opinion of their opponents, as the Twins went 12–1 in postseason 
home games during those two seasons.[89] These were the first two World 
Series in professional baseball history in which a team won the championship 
by winning all four home games.[90] (The feat has since been repeated once, 
by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001.) Nevertheless, the Twins argued that 
the Metrodome was obsolete and that the lack of a dedicated baseball-only 
ballpark limited team revenue and made it difficult to sustain a top-notch, 
competitive team (the Twins had been sharing tenancy in stadiums with the 
NFL's Minnesota Vikings since 1961). The team was rumored to contemplate 
moving to such places as New Jersey, Las Vegas, Portland, Oregon, the Greensboro/Winston-Salem, 
North Carolina, area, and elsewhere in search of a more financially competitive 
market. In 2002, the team was nearly disbanded when Major League Baseball 
selected the Twins and the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals 
franchise) for elimination due to their financial weakness relative to 
other franchises in the league. The impetus for league contraction diminished 
after a court decision forced the Twins to play out their lease on the 
Metrodome. However, Twins owner Carl Pohlad continued his efforts to relocate, 
pursuing litigation against the Metropolitan Stadium Commission and obtaining 
a state court ruling that his team was not obligated to play in the Metrodome 
after the 2006 season. This cleared the way for the Twins to either be 
relocated or disbanded prior to the 2007 season if a new deal was not reached. 
In response to the threatened loss of the Twins, the Minnesota private 
and public sector negotiated and approved a financing package for a replacement 
stadium— a baseball-only outdoor, natural turf ballpark in the Warehouse 
District of downtown Minneapolis— owned by a new entity known as the Minnesota 
Ballpark Authority.[91] Target Field was constructed at a cost of $544.4 million 
(including site acquisition and infrastructure), utilizing the proceeds 
of a $392 million public bond offering based on a 0.15% sales tax in Hennepin 
County and private financing of $185 million provided by the Pohlad family.[92][93] 
As part of the deal, the Twins also signed a 30-year lease of the new stadium, 
effectively guaranteeing the continuation of the team in Minnesota for 
a long time to come. Construction of the new field began in 2007, and was 
completed in December 2009, in time for the 2010 season. Commissioner Bud 
Selig, who earlier had threatened to disband the team, observed that without 
the new stadium the Twins could not have committed to sign their star player, 
catcher Joe Mauer, to an 8-year, $184 million contract extension. The first 
regular season game in Target Field was played against the Boston Red Sox 
on April 12, 2010, with Mauer driving in two runs and going 3-for-5 to 
help the Twins defeat the Red Sox, 5–2.[94] On May 18, 2011, Target Field 
was named "The Best Place To Shop" by Street and Smith's SportsBusiness 
Journal at the magazine's 2011 Sports Business Awards Ceremony in New York 
City.[95] It was also named "The Best Sports Stadium in North America" 
by ESPN The Magazine in a ranking that included over 120 different stadiums, 
ballparks and arenas from around North America.[96] In July, 2014, Target 
Field hosted the 85th Major League Baseball All-Star Game and the Home 
Run Derby. Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches 36

Herb Carneal Russ Hodges Arch McDonald Chuck Thompson Bob Wolff The Metrodome's 
upper deck in center and right fields was partly covered by a curtain containing 
banners of various titles won, and retired numbers. There was no acknowledgment 
of the Twins' prior championships in Washington and several Senator Hall 
of Famers, such as Walter Johnson, played in the days prior to numbers 
being used on uniforms. However Killebrew played seven seasons as a Senator, 
including two full seasons as a regular prior to the move to Minnesota 
in 1961. Prior to the addition of the banners, the Twins acknowledged their 
retired numbers on the Metrodome's outfield fence. Harmon Killebrew's #3 
was the first to be displayed, as it was the only one the team had retired 
when they moved in. It was joined by Rod Carew's #29 in 1987, Tony Oliva's 
#6 in 1991, Kent Hrbek's #14 in 1995, and Kirby Puckett's #34 in 1997 before 
the Twins began hanging the banners to reduce capacity. The championships, 
meanwhile were marked on the "Baggie" in right field. In the Metrodome, 
the numbers ran in that order from left to right. In Target Field, they 
run from right to left, presumably to allow space for additional numbers 
in the future. The retired numbers also serve as entry points at Target 
Field, The center field gate is Gate No. 3, honoring Killebrew, the left 
field gate is Gate No. 6, honoring Oliva, the home plate gate is Gate No. 
14, for Hrbek, the right field gate serves as Gate No. 29, in tribute to 
Carew, and the plaza gate is known as Gate No. 34, honoring Puckett. The 
numbers that have been retired hang within Target Field in front of the 
tower that serves as the Twins' executive offices in left field foul territory. 
The championships banners have been replaced by small pennants that fly 
on masts at the back of the left field upper deck. Those pennants, along 
with the flags flying in the plaza behind right field, serve as a visual 
cue for the players, suggesting the wind direction and speed. Jackie Robinson's 
number, 42, was retired by Major League Baseball on April 15, 1997 and 
formally honored by the Twins on May 23, 1997.[106] Robinson's number was 
positioned to the left of the Twins numbers in both venues. [107][108] 
As of 2007, the Twins took the rights to the broadcasts in-house and created 
the Twins Radio Network (TRN). With that new network in place the Twins 
secured a new Metro Affiliate flagship radio station in KSTP. It replaced 
WCCO, which held broadcast rights for the Twins since the team moved to 
Minneapolis in 1961. For 2013, the Twins moved to FM radio on KTWN-FM 96.3 
K-Twin, which is owned by the Pohlad family. The original radio voices 
of the Twins in 1961 were Ray Scott, Halsey Hall and Bob Wolff. After the 
first season, Herb Carneal replaced Wolff. Twins TV and radio broadcasts 
were originally sponsored by the Hamm's Brewing Company. In 2009, Treasure 
Island Resort & Casino became the first ever naming rights partner for 
the Twins Radio Network, making the commercial name of TRN the Treasure 
Island Baseball Network.[109] Cory Provus is the current radio play by 
play announcer,[110] taking over in 2012 for longtime Twins voice John 
Gordon who retired following the 2011 season.[111] Former Twins OF Dan 
Gladden serves as color commentator.[112] TRN broadcasts are originated 
from the studios at Minnesota News Network and Minnesota Farm Networks. 
Kris Atteberry hosts the pre-game show, the "Lineup Card" and the "Post-game 
Download" from those studios except when filling in for Provus or Gladden 
when they are on vacation. On April 1, 2007, Herb Carneal, the radio voice 
of the Twins for all but one year of their existence, died at his home 
in Minnetonka, Minnesota after a long battle with a list of illnesses. 
Carneal is in the broadcasters wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame.[113] 
The television rights are held by Fox Sports North[114] with Dick Bremer 
as the play-by-play announcer and former Twin, 2011 National Baseball Hall 
of Fame inductee,[115] Bert Blyleven as color analyst. They are sometimes 
joined by Ron Coomer and Roy Smalley.[116] Bob Casey was the Twins first 
public-address announcer starting in 1961 and continuing until his death 
in 2005. He was well known for his unique delivery and his signature announcements 
of "No smoking in the Metrodome, either go outside or quit!" (or "go back 
to Boston", etc.), "Batting 3rd, the center-fielder, No. 34, Kirby Puckett!!!" 
and asking fans not to 'throw anything or anybody' onto the field.[117] 
Fans wave a Homer Hanky to rally the team during play-offs and other crucial 
games. The Homer Hanky was created by Terrie Robbins of the Star Tribune 
newspaper in the Twin Cities in 1987. It was her idea to originally give 
away 60,000 inaugural Homer Hankies. That year, over 2.3 million Homer 
Hankies were distributed.[119] The party atmosphere of the Twins clubhouse 
after a win is well-known,[120] the team's players unwinding with loud 
rock music (usually the choice of the winning pitcher) and video games.[120] 
The club has several hazing rituals, such as requiring the most junior 
relief pitcher on the team to carry water and snacks to the bullpen in 
a brightly colored small child's backpack (Barbie in 2005, SpongeBob SquarePants 
in 2006, Hello Kitty in 2007, Disney Princess and Tinkerbell in 2009, Chewbacca 
and Darth Vader in 2010),[120] and many of its players, both past and present, 
are notorious pranksters.[120] For example, Bert Blyleven earned the nickname 
"The Frying Dutchman" for his ability to pull the "hotfoot" – which entails 
crawling under the bench in the dugout and lighting a teammate's shoelaces
