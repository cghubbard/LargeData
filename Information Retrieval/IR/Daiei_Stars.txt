Nippon Professional Baseball The Daiei Stars (大映スターズ, Daiei Sutāzu?) were 
a Japanese professional baseball team that was founded in 1946, and played 
in various incarnations until 1957. Overall, the franchise only had three 
winning seasons, never rising higher than third place. They were in the 
second division, or B-class, for seven seasons, including their last four 
years. The Stars played in Korakuen Stadium in Bunkyo, Tokyo. The franchise 
was founded as Gold Star, a new post-war team in the Japanese Baseball 
League. They were owned by textile manufacturer and Lucky Gold Star Telephones 
owner Komajiro Tamura,[1] who also owned Pacific[2] (formerly Asahi). Gold 
Star consisted mostly of former Asahi Baseball Club players, and was managed 
by Asahi's former manager Michinori Tubouchi.[2] In the team's inaugural 
season, they won 43 games and lost 60, finishing 22 games out of first 
place. The next year the team became the Kinsei Stars ("Kinsei" meaning 
gold star in Japanese)[2] and signed long-time Tokyo Kyojin/Yomiuri Giants 
pitcher Victor Starffin (who came over from Tamura's other team, the Taiyo 
Robins [formerly Gold Star]). Starffin pitched for the franchise for six 
seasons, winning 80 games and losing 70. 1948 was also when the team hired 
Sadayoshi Fujimoto as manager (he stayed at the helm of the team until 
partway through their final season, 1956). In 1949, after being bought 
by Masaichi Nagata/the Daiei Motion Picture Company, the team changed its 
name to the Daiei Stars, with Nagata serving as team president. In 1950 
the Stars became charter members of the Pacific League when the JBL reorganized 
into Nippon Professional Baseball and split into two distinct entities. 
Outfielder Shigeya Iijima was a league Best Nine Award-winner in 1950–1951. 
He led the Pacific League in batting in 1952, hitting .336, while his teammate 
Giichi Hayashi led the league in innings pitched, with 269-2⁄3. In 1957, 
the Stars merged with the Takahashi Unions to form the Daiei Unions. The 
Unions existed for a single season, finishing last in the Pacific League, 
at 41-89-2, 43-1/2 games out of first. Pitcher Masayoshi Miura led the 
Pacific League in losses, with 21. In 1958, the Unions merged with the 
Mainichi Orions to form the Daimai Orions. This enabled the Pacific League 
to shrink from the ungainly seven-team arrangement (caused by the 1957
