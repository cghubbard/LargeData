The 1941 Brooklyn Dodgers, led by manager Leo Durocher, won their first 
pennant in 21 years, edging the St. Louis Cardinals by 2.5 games. They 
went on to lose to the New York Yankees in the World Series. In The New 
Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, this team was referenced as one 
of "The Greatest Teams That Never Was", due to the quality of its starting 
lineup. Dolph Camilli was the slugging star with 34 home runs and 120 RBI. 
He was voted the National League's Most Valuable Player. Pete Reiser, a 
22-year-old rookie, led the league in batting average, slugging percentage, 
and runs scored. Other regulars included Hall of Famers Billy Herman, Joe 
Medwick, Pee Wee Reese, and Dixie Walker. Not surprisingly, the Dodgers 
scored the most runs of any NL team (800). The pitching staff featured 
a pair of 22-game winners, Kirby Higbe and Whitlow Wyatt, having their 
best pro seasons. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Coaches Note:

The 1941 World Series matched the New York Yankees against the Dodgers, 
with the Yankees winning in five games to capture their fifth title in 
six years, and their ninth overall. The name "Subway Series" arose for 
a World Series played between two New York City teams. The series was punctuated 
by the Dodgers' Mickey Owen's dropped third strike of a sharply breaking 
curveball (a suspected spitball) pitched by Hugh Casey to Tommy Henrich 
in the 9th inning of Game 4. The play led to a Yankees rally and brought 
them one win away from another championship. The Yankees were back after 
a one-year hiatus, having won thirteen (13) of their last fourteen (14) 
Series games and twenty-eight (28) of their last thirty-one (31) games 
in the World Series. This was the first Subway Series between the Brooklyn 
Dodgers and New York Yankees, who had already faced the crosstown New York 
Giants five times, and the Series was now 1–0 in favor of the Bronx Bombers. 
These two teams would meet a total of seven (7) times from 1941–1956 – 
the Dodgers' only victory coming in 1955. October 1, 1941, at Yankee Stadium
