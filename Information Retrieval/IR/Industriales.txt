Home Away Industriales is a baseball team in the Cuban National Series. 
One of the two teams based in the city of Havana, Industriales is historically 
the most successful team in the National Series, the main domestic competition 
in post-revolutionary Cuban baseball. They are similar to the New York 
Yankees in the sense that they have fans all over the country, being a 
sure sellout in any stadium, also hated by many outside the capital. The 
Super Classic of Cuban National Series takes place six times per season 
between Industriales and Santiago de Cuba, and it is also the equivalent 
of the MLB classic New York Yankees–Boston Red Sox, the matchup also represents

back to the era when Cuba was a colony of Spain, two centuries ago. They 
are known as the Lions (los leones) or "the Blue Ones" (los azules) or 
"the Blue Lions" (los Leones Azules). Royal blue is their color, though 
teams like Camagüey and Ciego de Ávila also have blue uniforms (navy blue 
and sky blue, respectively.) The team was founded in 1962, as representatives 
of all the workers from all the industries of Cuba. Industriales is the 
perceived heir to the Almendares baseball team from the professional Cuban 
League. They won the Cuban National Series in 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1973, 
1986, 1992, 1996, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2010. Today the team holds the record 
of victories in a season (90 games in Cuba) with 66 and more National Series 
won in a row with 4. The following Industriales players have been named
