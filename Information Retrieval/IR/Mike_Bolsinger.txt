Michael P. Bolsinger (born January 29, 1988) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played for the Arizona Diamondbacks and Los Angeles Dodgers. 
Bolsinger graduated from McKinney North High School in McKinney, Texas, 
where he was a three-year letterman in Baseball.[1] As a senior, he pitched 
to a 9–3 win–loss record with a 1.66 earned run average (ERA) and 116 strikeouts[2] 
and took his team to the state semi-finals, beating the Highland Park High 
School team that included future teammate Clayton Kershaw.[3] He was drafted 
by the Cleveland Indians in the 34th round of the 2006 Major League Baseball 
draft and his high school coach said "Obviously he has the talent to play 
at the next level. It's not much of a surprise to me that he got drafted."[1] 
He chose not to sign with the Indians because of the low round and, even 
though he had signed a letter of intent to Texas Tech University, he chose 
instead to attend Grayson County Community College in the hopes of being 
drafted again the next year.[1] In 10 appearances for Grayson, he was 6–1 
with a 2.93 ERA and struck out 48 batters.[2] Bolsinger played in the Texas 
Collegiate League during the summer of 2007 and chose to transfer to the 
University of Arkansas for the 2008 season.[2] As a sophomore in 2008, 
he was 4–1 with a 3.73 ERA in 15 games, most of them out of the bullpen.[4] 
He missed the start of the 2009 season as he was battling a bad case of 
mononucleosis[5] He was 6–4 with a 2.99 ERA in 30 games pitched that season[4] 
as the Razorbacks advanced to the College World Series, where they finished 
third.[6] He was drafted in the 33rd round of the 2009 Major League Baseball 
draft by the Oakland Athletics, but chose to return to Arkansas for his 
senior season.[7] Bolsinger began the 2010 season as the teams closer and 
earned a spot on the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association "Stopper 
of the Year Watch List."[8] However, he made a successful transition to 
the starting rotation during the season[9] and earned Southeastern Conference 
pitcher of the week honors on May 10 when pitched eight innings and struck 
out 11 while allowing only two hits against the University of Mississippi.[10] 
For the season, Bolsinger appeared in 23 games (13 as a starter) and was 
6–5 with a 4.81 ERA.[4] Bolsinger was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks 
in the 15th round of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft and signed on 
June 26, 2010.[11] He was assigned to the Short Season-A Yakima Bears of 
the Northwest League, where he had a 1.69 ERA in six games.[12] He spent 
most of 2011 with the Class-A South Bend Silver Hawks of the Midwest League, 
appearing in 32 games and starting 13 of them. He also made one scoreless 
relief appearance with the Triple-A Reno Aces. He posted a 6–6 record with 
a 2.63 ERA and 91 strikeouts in the 2011 season.[12] 2012 was split between 
the Advanced-A Visalia Rawhide of the California League and the Double-A

starts, and pitched to a 4–0 record, 2.51 ERA, and 31 strikeouts when he 
was promoted to Reno. Bolsinger would make 17 starts for Reno, and post 
a 7–7 win–loss record, 4.72 ERA.[12] Bolsinger was called up to the majors 
for the first time on April 14, 2014.[13] He pitched three innings of relief 
that day against the New York Mets, while allowing six hits and two runs.[14] 
He got his first Major League start on April 19 against the Los Angeles 
Dodgers and allowed seven runs in four innings to take the loss and recorded 
his first win when he worked 6.2 innings against the Chicago Cubs on April 
24.[15] That was his only win however as he went 1–6 with a 5.50 ERA in 
10 games (nine starts) for the Diamondbacks in 2014.[11] He also made 16 
starts for Reno and was 8–3 with a 3.93 ERA.[12] He was designated for

one run on 5 hits and had 5 strikeouts, but was not involved in the decision.[19] 
He returned to the minors the following day.[20] On May 23 against the 
San Diego Padres, Bolsinger retired 23 straight batters after giving up
