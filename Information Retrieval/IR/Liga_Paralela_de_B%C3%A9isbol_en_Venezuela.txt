Liga Paralela de BÃ©isbol (translated: Parallel Baseball League) is a baseball 
league competition held in Venezuela during the winter. Its relationship 
to the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League is similar to that of the 
AA and AAA Minor League Baseball leagues to Major League Baseball in the 
U.S.A. After players finish the league competition, they often join the 
MLB. It gives some of the younger Venezuelan players an opportunity to 
play in their home country during the winter. Many player who join the 
league during the international signing period have not played in the Dominican 
Summer League or the Venezuelan Summer League, thus the Liga Paralela can 
provide a first glimpse at some of the year's top Venezuelan signings. 
International scouts say the quality of the league has improved over the 
last few years and has become an indicator of whether players are ready 
to make the leap to a rookie league in the United States. This winter league 
is organized by the same organization that runs the Venezuelan Summer League.
