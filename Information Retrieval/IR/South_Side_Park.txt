South Side Park was the name used for three different baseball parks that 
formerly stood in Chicago, Illinois, at different times, and whose sites 
were all just a few blocks away from each other. The first South Side Park 
was somewhere in the neighborhood of 39th Street and South Wabash Avenue, 
and was the home of a short-lived entry in the Union Association of 1884. 
The second South Side Park was at 35th Street and South Wentworth Avenue, 
just east of the eventual Comiskey Park. It was first the home of the Chicago 
entry of the Players' League of 1890 (whose roster included Charles Comiskey), 
and then was the home of the National League team now called the Chicago 
Cubs during parts of 1891–1893. The third South Side Park, the best known 
and longest lived venue by that name, was on the north side of 39th Street 
(now called Pershing Road) between South Wentworth Avenue and South Princeton 
Avenue, located at 41°49′28″N 87°37′58″W﻿ / ﻿41.82444°N 87.63278°W﻿ / 41.82444; 
-87.63278. The 39th Street Grounds served as the playing field of the Chicago 
Wanderers cricket team during the 1893 World's Fair. After Charles Comiskey 
built a wooden grandstand on the site in 1900, it became the home of the 
Chicago White Sox of the American League. It served as home to the White 
Sox first in 1900 as a minor league team, and then from 1901 to June 27, 
1910 as a major league team. The team abandoned the wooden ballpark, with 
its capacity of 15,000, in the middle of the 1910 season after their new 
steel-and-concrete, and much larger Comiskey Park was finished, just three 
blocks north of the old park (corner to corner), where they began an 80 
1⁄2 season run. Meanwhile, South Side Park became the home of the newly 
formed Negro League baseball team called the Chicago American Giants in 
1911. It was renamed Schorling's Park for team owner Rube Foster's white 
business partner, John C. Schorling, a south side saloon keeper who leased 
the grounds and happened to be Comiskey's son-in-law. The American Giants 
played their games there through the 1940 season. Then on Christmas Day 
of 1940, Schorling's Park was destroyed by fire. The American Giants would 
play their remaining 10 seasons at Comiskey Park. Today, the Chicago Housing 
Authority's Wentworth Gardens housing project occupies the site. The South 
Side Park/Schorling's Park/Wentworth Gardens site is located across Pershing 
Road from a junkyard site which was named a Superfund site in the late 
1990s. It was the site of baseball's first crosstown world series in 1906. 
The Chicago White Sox defeated their crosstown rival Chicago Cubs in 6 
games to clinch the title at home with an 8-3 victory to capture their 
first World Series title. It was the home for the Negro National League(NNL) 
champion Chicago American Giants in 1920, 1921, 1922, 1926, and 1927. In 
1932, the Cole's American Giants won the Negro Southern League pennant.
