Garry Lewis Templeton, nicknamed "Jumpsteady", (born March 24, 1956 in 
Lockney, Texas) is a former shortstop in Major League Baseball who played 
for the St. Louis Cardinals, San Diego Padres, and New York Mets from 1976 
to 1991. Templeton had good batting numbers in an era when shortstops did 
not provide much offense. He was hailed by many as one of the best players 
in baseball early in his career, which featured All-Star Game selections 
in 1977 and 1979. In the latter year, Templeton made history as the first 
switch-hitter to collect 100 hits from each side of the plate, a feat achieved 
only once more by Willie Wilson. His total of 211 hits led the National 
League, and with 19 triples, he led the league for a third consecutive 
season. He led the Cardinals in hits in 1977, 1978, and 1979.[1] He caused 
some controversy in 1979 when, despite having better numbers than either 
Dave Concepción or Larry Bowa, two of the National League's premier shortstops 
at the time, he wasn't selected to start at shortstop for the National 
League All-Star team. He was named to the team as a reserve, but refused 
to go. He continued to hit well in 1980 and 1981; however, he was not popular 
with Cardinals fans. The situation with Cardinal Nation came to a head 
when, during an August 26, 1981 home game in St. Louis, Templeton made 
an obscene gesture to some fans who had allegedly been heckling him after 
he had failed to run to first on a ground ball; manager Whitey Herzog physically 
pulled Templeton off the field following the incident. After the end of 
the season the Cardinals traded him to the Padres for Ozzie Smith. The 
trade was welcomed by everyone involved: Smith was (then) a light-hitting 
defensive wizard going to a team which needed to improve its defense (and 
he was also embroiled in a contract dispute with Padres' management), while 
Templeton was a better hitter going to a team which needed to improve its 
offense (and who was, due to his actions, no longer popular with the fans 
or the team). He was named team captain of the Padres by manager Larry 
Bowa in 1987, and assumed that role until he was traded to the New York 
Mets for Tim Teufel in 1991. Templeton was inducted into the San Diego 
Padres Hall of Fame on August 8, 2015.[2] After his retirement as an active 
player in 1991, Templeton stayed in the game as a coach and minor-league 
manager. From 1998 through 2001, he managed in the Anaheim Angels organization 
for four different teams, posting a 294-272 record. From 2003 to 2004, 
he managed the Gary Railcats of the Northern League, moving on to manage 
the Golden Baseball League's Fullerton Flyers in 2005. After three years 
with the Flyers, he would move on to manage the Arizona Winter League's 
Palm Springs Chill in 2008, then would return to the GBL to manage the 
Long Beach Armada in 2009. He managed the Chico Outlaws to the GBL Championship 
in 2010.[3][4] On January 8, 2013, Templeton was named manager of the Newark 
Bears of the independent Can-Am League.[5] His son, Garry Templeton, Jr. 
played minor league baseball from 1999–2007 and became a manager for the
