The 1992 Major League Baseball season saw a resurgence in pitching dominance. 
On average, one out of every seven games pitched that season was a shutout; 
in 2,106 MLB regular-season games, 298 shutouts were pitched (up from 272 
in 2,104 regular-season games in 1991).[1][2] Two teams pitched at least 
20 shutouts each; the Atlanta Braves led the Majors with 24 and the Pittsburgh 
Pirates finished second with 20. In the National League, no team hit more 
than 138 home runs and no team scored 700 runs. The San Francisco Giants 
were shut out 18 times, the most in the Majors.[3][4] The effect was similar 
in the American League. In 1991, two AL teams had scored at least 800 runs 
and three had collected 1,500 hits.[5] In 1992, no team scored 800 runs 
and only one reached 1,500 hits.[6] The California Angels were shut out 
15 times, the most in the AL.[7] The Toronto Blue Jays won the World Series, 
beating the Braves and winning the first World Series title outside of 
the United States, also setting a record for the fastest expansion team
