Geoffrey Edward Blum (born April 26, 1973) is an American former professional 
baseball infielder in Major League Baseball and current part-time announcer 
for the Houston Astros.[1] During his major-league career, he played for 
the Montreal Expos, Houston Astros, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, San Diego Padres, 
Chicago White Sox and Arizona Diamondbacks. As a member of the World Series 
Champion White Sox in 2005, he hit the game-deciding home run in the longest 
contest in the history of the Fall Classic. Before becoming a professional 
baseball player, he majored in sociology at the University of California, 
Berkeley and played for the California Golden Bears baseball team. He began 
his professional career when he was selected in the seventh round of the 
1994 amateur draft by the Montreal Expos. During his time with the Expos, 
he spent the winter of 1995 in the Australian Baseball League with the 
Hunter Eagles.[2] After playing there for three years, he was traded to 
the Houston Astros in exchange for Chris Truby. He was then traded after 
the 2003 season to Tampa Bay Devil Rays in exchange for Brandon Backe. 
In 2004 he batted only .215 for the Devil Rays, with a .266 OBP. Blum signed 
with the San Diego Padres as a free agent on December 9, 2004. He was traded 
to the Chicago White Sox for a minor leaguer on July 31, 2005. On October 
25, 2005, Blum hit a home run against the Astros at Minute Maid Park in 
the top of the 14th inning to win Game 3 of the World Series, the longest 
game in the history of the Fall Classic. On April 11, 2008 a monument celebrating 
the 2005 World Series was unveiled at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago, featuring 
bronze statues of five players. Blum is one of them, commemorating his 
tie-breaking home run. The home run would forever cement his place in White 
Sox history.[citation needed] He returned to the Padres as a free agent 
in 2006.[3] On November 20, 2007, Blum signed a $1.1 million, one-year 
contract with the Houston Astros. The deal also included a club option 
for 2009.[4] Blum returned to the Astros in 2009 and played mostly 3B for 
Houston. He hit 10 home runs that season, drove in 49 runs and was known 
for playing excellent defense at all the infield positions. On October 
30, 2009, Blum re-signed with the Astros. The contract was worth $1.5 million 
for the 2010 season and included a mutual option for 2011, which would 
be worth $1.65 million that was declined, making him a free agent. Blum 
suffered a season ending injury to his elbow in July 2010 while putting 
on his shirt after a game. [5] He had this to say: "There are probably 
90 percent of us in the big leagues that have loose bodies floating around. 
I just so happens that after the game, it tightened up on me. The shirt 
had nothing to do with the damn injury."[6] On November 15, 2010, Blum 
signed a two-year contract worth $2.7 million with the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
He was released by the Diamondbacks on July 20, 2012. On January 12, 2013, 
he was named a color analyst of the Houston Astros for the 2013 season 
for about 60 games when Alan Ashby is doing play-by-play in place of Bill
