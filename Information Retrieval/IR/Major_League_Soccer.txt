Major League Soccer (MLS) is a men's professional soccer league, sanctioned 
by U.S. Soccer, that represents the sport's highest level in both the United 
States and Canada.[2][3] MLS constitutes one of the major professional 
sports leagues of the United States and Canada.[4][5] The league is composed 
of 20 teams—17 in the U.S. and 3 in Canada. The MLS regular season runs 
from March to October, with each team playing 34 games;[6][7] the team 
with the best record is awarded the Supporters' Shield. The postseason 
includes twelve teams competing in the MLS Cup Playoffs through November 
and December, culminating in the championship game, the MLS Cup.[8] MLS 
teams also play in other domestic competitions against teams from other 
divisions in the U.S. Open Cup and in the Canadian Championship. MLS teams 
also compete against continental rivals in the CONCACAF Champions League.[9] 
Major League Soccer was founded in 1993 as part of the United States' successful 
bid to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup.[10] The first season took place in 
1996 with ten teams.[11] MLS experienced financial and operational struggles 
in its first few years: The league lost millions of dollars, teams played 
in mostly empty American football stadiums, and two teams folded in 2002.[12] 
Since then, MLS has expanded to 20 teams, owners built soccer-specific 
stadiums, average MLS attendance exceeds that of the National Hockey League 
(NHL) and National Basketball Association (NBA), MLS secured national TV 
contracts, and the league is now profitable.[13] Instead of operating as 
an association of independently owned teams, MLS is a single entity in 
which each team is owned and controlled by the league's investors.[14] 
The investor-operators control their teams as owners control teams in other 
leagues, and are commonly (but inaccurately) referred to as the team's 
owners.[15] The league has a fixed membership, like most sports leagues 
in the United States and Canada, which makes it one of the world's few 
soccer leagues that does not use promotion and relegation, a practice that 
is uncommon in the two countries.[16] MLS headquarters is located in New 
York City.[17] Major League Soccer's regular season runs from March to 
October. Teams are divided into the Eastern and Western Conferences. Teams 
play 34 games in an unbalanced schedule: 24 matches against teams within 
their conference, plus 10 matches against teams from the other conference.[6][18] 
Midway through the season, teams break for the annual All-Star Game, a 
friendly game between the league's finest players and a major club from 
a different league.[19] At the end of the regular season, the team with 
the highest point total is awarded the Supporters' Shield.[20] Unlike some 
soccer leagues around the world, but similar to other leagues in the Americas,[21] 
the MLS regular season is followed by the 12-team MLS Cup Playoffs in November, 
ending with the MLS Cup championship final in early December.[22] Although 
some commentators have argued that playoffs reduce the importance of the 
regular season,[23] Commissioner Don Garber has explained "Our purpose 
is to have a valuable competition, and that includes having playoffs that 
are more meaningful."[24] Major League Soccer's spring-to-fall schedule 
results in scheduling conflicts with the FIFA calendar and with summertime 
international tournaments such as the World Cup and the Gold Cup,[25] causing 
several players to miss some MLS matches.[26] While MLS has looked into 
changing to an fall-to-spring format, there are no current plans to do 
so. If the league were to change its schedule, a winter break would be 
needed, especially with several teams in colder climates, which some believe 
would lead to a disadvantage.[27][28][29] It would also have to compete 
with the more popular National Football League (NFL), National Hockey League 
(NHL), and National Basketball Association (NBA).[29] MLS teams also play 
in other competitions. Every year, up to five MLS teams play in the CONCACAF 
Champions League against other clubs from the CONCACAF region (Mexico, 
Central America, and the Caribbean). Two U.S.-based MLS teams qualify based 
on MLS regular-season results: the winner of the Western conference and 
the winner of the Eastern conference. The third U.S. team to qualify is 
the winner of the MLS Cup. A fourth U.S.-based MLS team can qualify via 
the U.S. Open Cup,[30] where U.S. based teams compete against lower division 
U.S. clubs. If a team qualifies through multiple berths, or if any of the 
MLS berths are taken by a Canada-based MLS team, the berth is reallocated 
to the best U.S.-based team in the Supporters' Shield table which has failed 
to otherwise qualify. Canadian MLS clubs play against lower division Canadian 
clubs in the Canadian Championship for the one Champions League spot allocated 
to Canada.[31] No MLS club has won the Champions League since it began 
its current format in 2008, with Mexican clubs dominating the competition, 
but MLS teams have twice reached the final: Real Salt Lake in 2011 and 
the Montreal Impact in 2015. MLS's 20 teams are divided between the Eastern 
and Western Conference. Each club is allowed up to 30 players on its first 
team roster.[32] All 30 players are eligible for selection to each 18-player 
game-day squad during the regular season and playoffs.[32] Since the 2005 
season, MLS has added many new clubs. During this period of expansion, 
Los Angeles became the first two-team market, and the league pushed into 
Canada in 2007.[33] The league will expand from 20 teams today to 22 teams 
in 2017 with the additions of Atlanta and Minnesota, and then to 24 teams 
in 2018 with the addition of Los Angeles and likely Miami.[34] The league 
plans to have 24 teams by 2018.[35] In the history of MLS, twenty-three 
different clubs have competed in the league, with ten having won at least 
one MLS Cup, and ten winning at least one Supporters' Shield.[36] The same 
club has won both trophies six times.[37] Several teams compete annually 
for secondary MLS rivalry cups that are typically contested by two teams, 
usually geographic rivals (e.g., Portland vs. Seattle vs. Vancouver).[38] 
Each cup is awarded to the team with the better regular-season record in 
games played between the two teams. The concept is comparable to minor 
trophies played for by American college football teams.[39] Beginning with 
the 2015 season, teams are aligned as follows:[40] Major League Soccer 
is the most recent of a series of men's premier professional national soccer 
leagues established in the United States and Canada. The predecessor of 
MLS was the North American Soccer League (NASL), which played from 1968 
until 1984.[44] In 1988, in exchange for FIFA awarding the right to host 
the 1994 World Cup, U.S. Soccer promised to establish a Division 1 professional 
soccer league.[45] In 1993, U.S. Soccer selected Major League Professional 
Soccer (the precursor to MLS) as the exclusive Division 1 professional 
soccer league.[45] Major League Soccer was officially formed in February 
1995 as a limited liability company.[45] MLS began play in 1996 with ten 
teams. The first game was held on April 6, 1996, as the San Jose Clash 
defeated D.C. United before 31,000 fans at Spartan Stadium in San Jose 
in a game broadcast on ESPN.[46] The league had generated some buzz by 
managing to lure some marquee players from the 1994 World Cup to play in 
MLS—including U.S. stars such as Alexi Lalas, Tony Meola and Eric Wynalda, 
and foreign players such as Mexico's Jorge Campos and Colombia's Carlos 
Valderrama.[47] D.C. United won the MLS Cup in three of the league's first 
four seasons.[48] The league added its first two expansion teams in 1998—the 
Miami Fusion and the Chicago Fire; the Chicago Fire won its first title 
in its inaugural season.[49] After its first season, MLS suffered from 
a decline in attendance.[50] The league's low attendance was all the more 
apparent in light of the fact that eight of the original ten teams played 
in large American football stadiums.[49] One aspect that had alienated 
fans was that MLS experimented with rules deviations in its early years 
in an attempt to "Americanize" the sport. The league implemented the use 
of shootouts to resolve tie games. MLS also used a countdown clock and 
halves ended when the clock reached 0:00. The league realized that the 
rule changes had alienated some traditional soccer fans while failing to 
draw new American sports fans, and the shootout and countdown clock were 
eliminated after the 1999 season.[51] The league's quality was cast into 
doubt when the U.S. men's national team, which was made up largely of MLS 
players, finished in last place at the 1998 World Cup.[49] Major League 
Soccer lost an estimated $250 million during its first five years, and 
more than $350 million between its founding and 2004.[52][53][54][55] The 
league's financial problems led to Commissioner Doug Logan being replaced 
by Garber, a former NFL executive, in August 1999.[56] MLS announced in 
January 2002 that it had decided to contract the Tampa Bay Mutiny and Miami 
Fusion, leaving the league with ten teams.[57] Despite the financial problems, 
though, MLS did have some accomplishments that would set the stage for 
the league's resurgence. Columbus Crew Stadium was built in 1999, becoming 
MLS's first soccer-specific stadium.[58] This began a trend among MLS teams 
to construct their own venues instead of leasing American football stadiums.[59] 
In 2000, the league won an antitrust lawsuit, Fraser v. Major League Soccer, 
that the players had filed in 1996. The court ruled that MLS's policy of 
centrally contracting players and limiting player salaries through a salary 
cap and other restrictions were a legal method for the league to maintain 
solvency and competitive parity.[60] The 2002 FIFA World Cup, in which 
the United States unexpectedly made the quarterfinals, coincided with a 
resurgence in American soccer and MLS.[38] MLS Cup 2002 drew 61,316 spectators 
to Gillette Stadium, the largest attendance in an MLS Cup final.[61] MLS 
limited teams to three substitutions per game in 2003, and adopted International 
Football Association Board (IFAB) rules in 2005.[62] MLS underwent a transition 
in the years leading up to the 2006 World Cup. After marketing itself on 
the talents of American players, the league lost some of its homegrown 
stars to prominent European leagues. For example, Tim Howard was transferred 
to Manchester United for $4 million in one of the most lucrative contract 
deals in league history.[63][64] Many more American players did make an 
impact in MLS. In 2005, Jason Kreis became the first player to score 100 
career MLS goals.[65] The league's financial stabilization plan included 
teams moving out of large American football stadiums and into soccer-specific 
stadiums.[57] From 2003 to 2008, the league oversaw the construction of 
six additional soccer-specific stadiums, largely funded by owners such 
as Lamar Hunt and Phil Anschutz, so that by the end of 2008, a majority 
of teams were now in soccer-specific stadiums.[49] It was also in this 
era that MLS expanded for the first time since 1998. Real Salt Lake and 
Chivas USA began play in 2005, with Chivas USA becoming the second club 
in Los Angeles.[66] By 2006 the San Jose Earthquakes owners, players and 
a few coaches moved to Texas to become the expansion Houston Dynamo, after 
failing to build a stadium in San Jose. The Dynamo became an expansion 
team, leaving their history behind for a new San Jose ownership group that 
formed in 2007.[67] In 2007 the league expanded beyond the United States' 
borders into Canada with the Toronto FC expansion team.[68] Major League 
Soccer took steps to further raise the level of play by adopting the Designated 
Player Rule, which helped bring international stars into the league.[69] 
The 2007 season witnessed the MLS debut of David Beckham. Beckham's signing 
had been seen as a coup for American soccer, and was made possible by the 
Designated Player Rule. Players such as Cuauhtémoc Blanco (Chicago Fire) 
and Juan Pablo Ángel (New York Red Bulls), are some of the first Designated 
Players who made major contributions to their clubs.[70] The departures 
of Clint Dempsey and Jozy Altidore, coupled with the return of former U.S. 
national team stars Claudio Reyna and Brian McBride, highlighted the exchange 
of top prospects to Europe for experienced veterans to MLS.[71] By 2008, 
San Jose had returned to the league under new ownership, and in 2009, the 
expansion side Seattle Sounders FC began play in MLS.[68] The 2010 season 
ushered in an expansion franchise in the Philadelphia Union and their new 
PPL Park stadium.[68] The 2010 season also brought the opening of the New 
York Red Bulls' soccer-specific stadium, Red Bull Arena, and the debut 
of French striker Thierry Henry.[72] The 2011 season brought further expansion 
with the addition of the Vancouver Whitecaps FC, the second Canadian MLS 
franchise, and the Portland Timbers.[73] Real Salt Lake reached the finals 
of the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League.[74] During the 2011 season, the 
Galaxy signed another international star in Republic of Ireland all-time 
leading goalscorer Robbie Keane.[75] MLS drew an average attendance of 
17,872 in 2011, higher than the average attendances of the NBA and NHL.[76] 
In 2012, the Montreal Impact became the league's 19th franchise and the 
third in Canada, and made their home debut in front of a crowd of 58,912,[77] 
while the New York Red Bulls added Australian all-time leading goalscorer 
Tim Cahill. In 2013, MLS introduced New York City FC[78] as its 20th team, 
and Orlando City Soccer Club[79] as its 21st team, both of which would 
begin playing in 2015. In 2013, the league implemented its "Core Players" 
initiative, allowing teams to retain key players using retention funds 
instead of losing the players to foreign leagues.[80] Among the first high-profile 
players re-signed in 2013 using retention funds were U.S. national team 
regulars Graham Zusi and Matt Besler. Beginning in summer of 2013 and continuing 
in the run up to the 2014 World Cup, MLS began signing U.S. stars based 
abroad, including Clint Dempsey from the English Premier League to Seattle, 
DaMarcus Beasley from the Liga MX to Houston, Jermaine Jones from the German 
Bundesliga to New England and Michael Bradley who returned from Italy to 
join Toronto who also signed England International Striker Jermain Defoe.[81] 
By the 2014 season, fifteen of the nineteen MLS head coaches had previously 
played in MLS.[82] By 2013, the league's popularity had increased to the 
point where MLS was as popular as Major League Baseball among 12- to 17-year-olds, 
as reported by the 2013 Luker on Trends ESPN poll, having jumped in popularity 
since the 2010 World Cup.[83][84] In 2014, the league announced Atlanta 
United FC as the 22nd team to start playing in 2017.[85] Even though New 
York City FC and Orlando City were not set to begin play until 2015, each 
team made headlines during the summer 2014 transfer window by announcing 
their first Designated Players – Spain's leading scorer David Villa and 
Chelsea's leading scorer Frank Lampard to New York, and Ballon d'Or winner 
Kaká to Orlando.[86] The 2014 World Cup featured 21 MLS players on World 
Cup rosters and a record 11 MLS players playing for foreign teams – including 
players from traditional powerhouses Brazil (Júlio César), playing for 
Toronto FC on loan from Queens Park Rangers FC, and Spain (David Villa), 
on loan to Melbourne City FC from New York City FC; in the U.S. v. Germany 
match the U.S. fielded a team with seven MLS starters.[87] On September 
18, 2014, MLS unveiled their new logo as part of the "MLS Next" branding 
initiative. In addition to the new crest logo, MLS teams display versions 
in their own colors that are displayed on their jerseys at every game. 
This change represents the first time that the MLS logo has been changed 
since the league's inception. Chivas USA folded following the 2014 season, 
while New York City FC and Orlando City SC joined the league in 2015 as 
the 19th and 20th teams.[88] Sporting Kansas City and the Houston Dynamo 
moved from the Eastern Conference to the Western Conference in 2015 to 
make two 10-team conferences.[40] In early 2015, the league announced that 
two teams — Los Angeles FC and Minnesota United — would join MLS in either 
2017 or 2018.[34] The 20th season of MLS saw the arrivals of several players 
who have starred at the highest levels of European club soccer and in international 
soccer: Giovanni Dos Santos, Kaká, Andrea Pirlo, Frank Lampard, Steven 
Gerrard, Didier Drogba, David Villa, and Sebastian Giovinco.[89] On December 
6, 2015, MLS announced its intent to expand to 28 teams.[90] MLS confirmed 
in August 2016 that Minnesota United would begin play in 2017 along with 
Atlanta United FC.[91] MLS Cup titles and Supporters' Shield Wins Major 
League Soccer operates under a single-entity structure in which teams and 
player contracts are centrally owned by the league.[3][15][92] Each team 
has an investor-operator that is a shareholder in the league.[93] In order 
to control costs, MLS shares revenues and holds players contracts instead 
of players contracting with individual teams. In Fraser v. Major League 
Soccer, a lawsuit filed in 1996 and decided in 2002, the league won a legal 
battle with its players in which the court ruled that MLS was a single 
entity that can lawfully centrally contract for player services.[3] The 
court also ruled that even absent their collective bargaining agreement, 
players could opt to play in other leagues if they were unsatisfied.[3] 
Having multiple clubs owned by a single owner was a necessity in the league's 
first ten years.[94] At one time Phil Anschutz's AEG owned six MLS clubs 
and Lamar Hunt's Hunt Sports owned three franchises. In order to attract 
additional investors, in 2002 the league announced changes to the operating 
agreement between the league and its teams to improve team revenues and 
increase the incentives to be an individual club owner.[95] These changes 
included granting owners the rights to a certain number of players they 
develop through their club's academy system each year, sharing the profits 
of Soccer United Marketing, and being able to sell individual club jersey 
sponsorships.[95] As MLS appeared to be on the brink of overall profitability 
in 2006 and developed significant expansion plans, MLS announced that it 
wanted each club to have a distinct operator.[96] The league has attracted 
new ownership that have injected more money into the league.[97] Examples 
include Red Bull's purchase of the MetroStars from AEG in 2006 for over 
$100 million.[94][98] The league now has 20 investor-operators for its 
20 clubs. Hunt Sports owns only one team (FC Dallas). AEG owns the LA Galaxy 
and retained a 50% interest in the Houston Dynamo until December 2015.[99][100] 
For the 2014 season, the league owned the former Chivas USA club, which 
had suffered from mismanagement and poor financial results under its individual 
operator relationship.[101][102] The league eventually dissolved the team,[103] 
in favor of awarding rights to a second soccer club in the Los Angeles 
area to a new ownership group on October 30, 2014.[104] The average salary 
for MLS players is $316,777,[105] lower than the average salaries in England's 
second-tier Football League Championship ($420,000 in 2015),[106] Holland's 
Eredivisie ($445,000),[107] or Mexico's Liga MX ($418,000 in 2015).[108] 
The league's minimum player salary increased in 2016 to $62,500 for most 
players, and roster players #25–28 saw their minimum salary increased to 
$51,500.[109][110] MLS salaries are limited by a salary cap, which MLS 
has had in place since the league's inception in 1996. The purpose of the 
salary cap is to prevent the team's owners from unsustainable spending 
on player salaries—a practice that had doomed the North American Soccer 
League during the 1980s—and to prevent a competitive imbalance among teams.[45] 
The salary cap survived a legal challenge by the players in the Fraser 
v. Major League Soccer lawsuit. The 2016 salary cap increased to $3.66 
million per team.[110] Teams may augment their squads by signing players 
from other leagues. MLS has two transfer windows—the primary pre-season 
transfer window lasts three months from mid February until mid May, and 
the secondary mid season transfer window runs one month from early July 
to early August.[111] When an MLS club sells one of its players overseas, 
the club and the league split the transfer revenues, with the club retaining 
from 33% to 75% depending on the player's status and tenure.[112] MLS teams 
have a limited number of international roster slots that they can use to 
sign non-domestic players. However MLS teams regularly obtain green cards 
for their non-domestic players to qualify them for domestic status and 
free up international roster slots.[113] In 2015, 49% of MLS players were 
born outside of the U.S. and Canada, with players from 58 countries represented.[114][115] 
MLS has also introduced various initiatives and rules intended to improve 
quality of players while still maintaining the salary cap. Rules concerning 
Designated Players and allocation money allow for additional wage spending 
that is exempt from the salary cap. These initiatives have brought about 
an increase in on-field competition.[116] The designated player (DP) rule 
allows teams to sign a limited number of players whose salary exceeds the 
maximum cap, each DP player only counts as $457,500 (the maximum non-DP 
salary) against the cap in 2016. Instituted in 2007, England's David Beckham 
was the first signing under the DP rule.[69] The DP rule has led to large 
income inequality in MLS with top DPs earning as much as 180 times more 
than a player earning the league minimum.[117] In the 2013 season 21% of 
the league's wage spending went to just 5 players, this stretched to 29% 
on the top 6 players in the 2014 season.[118][119] The league's "Core Players" 
initiative allows teams to re-sign players using retention funds that do 
not count against the salary cap.[80] Retention funds were implemented 
in 2013 as a mechanism for MLS to retain key players; among the first high-profile 
players re-signed using retention funds were U.S. national team regulars 
Graham Zusi and Matt Besler.[80] MLS teams can also obtain allocation money, 
which is money that the team can use on player salaries that does not count 
against the cap, and teams can earn allocation money in several ways, such 
as from the transfer fees earned by selling players to teams in other leagues.[120] 
MLS teams can also use Targeted Allocation Money (often referred to as 
TAM), an initiative announced in 2015. Teams can use TAM funds to attract 
high-profile players by "buying down" contracts of players to below the 
Designated Player level.[121] High-profile players for which TAM funds 
were used include Omar Gonzalez. MLS has introduced various initiatives 
and rules intended to develop young players. Rules concerning Generation 
Adidas players and home grown players provide incentives for clubs to develop 
and retain young players.[116] MLS has required all of its teams to operate 
youth development programs since 2008.[122] MLS roster rules allow teams 
to sign an unlimited number players straight from their academies and bypassing 
the draft process.[123] There is also supplementary salary budget made 
by MLS only for homegrown players that are registered using senior roster 
slots called homegrown player funds.[124] One of the most prominent and 
lucrative examples of success in "home-grown" development was Jozy Altidore, 
who rose to prominence as a teenager in MLS before his record transfer 
fee $10 million move to Villarreal in Spain in 2008.[125] The various MLS 
teams' development academies play matches in a U.S. Soccer developmental 
league against youth academies from other leagues such as the Division 
II North American Soccer League (NASL) and Division III USL Pro, the latter 
of which has now rebranded itself as the United Soccer League.[126] The 
league operates a Generation Adidas program, which is a joint venture between 
MLS and U.S. Soccer that encourages young American players to enter MLS.[127] 
The Generation Adidas program has been in place since 1997, and has introduced 
players such as Landon Donovan, Clint Dempsey, Tim Howard and Michael Bradley 
into MLS. Players under the Home Grown Player rule are signed to Generation 
Adidas contracts,[111] all players on Generation Adidas contracts are "off 
budget players" and their salaries do not count against the cap. MLS formerly 
operated a reserve league which gave playing time to players who were not 
starters for their MLS teams. The Reserve League was formed in 2005, and 
operated through 2014 (with the exception of the 2009 & 2010 seasons).[128] 
MLS began integrating its Reserve League with the league then known as 
USL Pro in 2013,[129] and after the 2014 season folded the Reserve League, 
with MLS now requiring all teams to either affiliate with a USL team or 
field their own reserve side in that league. Since 1999, the league has 
overseen the construction of twelve stadiums specifically designed for 
soccer. The development of soccer-specific stadiums owned by the teams 
has generated a better gameday experience for the fans.[130] The soccer-specific 
stadiums have yielded positive financial results as teams were no longer 
required to pay to rent out facilities and gained control over revenue 
streams such as concessions, parking, naming rights, and the ability to 
host non MLS events.[102][130] Several teams have doubled their season-tickets 
following the team's move into a soccer-specific stadium.[131] The establishment 
of soccer-specific stadiums is considered the key to the league and the 
ability of teams to turn a profit.[132] In 2006, Tim Leiweke, then CEO 
of Anschutz Entertainment Group, described the proliferation of soccer-specific 
stadiums as the turning point for MLS.[132] Columbus Crew owner Lamar Hunt 
started this trend in 1999 by constructing Columbus Crew Stadium, now known 
as Mapfre Stadium, as MLS's first soccer-specific stadium.[58] The Los 
Angeles Galaxy followed four years later with the opening of The Home Depot 
Center, now StubHub Center, in 2003.[133] FC Dallas opened Pizza Hut Park, 
now Toyota Stadium, in 2005, and the Chicago Fire began playing their home 
games in Toyota Park in 2006. The 2007 season brought the opening of Dick's 
Sporting Goods Park for the Colorado Rapids and BMO Field for Toronto FC.[134] 
Near the end of the 2008 season, Rio Tinto Stadium became the home of Real 
Salt Lake, which meant that for the first time in MLS history a majority 
of MLS's teams (8 out of 14) played in soccer-specific stadiums.[135] Red 
Bull Arena, the new home of the New York Red Bulls opened for the start 
of the 2010 season,[136] and the Philadelphia Union opened PPL Park, since 
renamed Talen Energy Stadium, in June 2010, midway through their inaugural 
season.[137] The following season, in 2011, the Portland Timbers made their 
MLS debut in a newly renovated Jeld-Wen Field, now renamed Providence Park, 
which was originally a multi-purpose venue but turned into a soccer-specific 
facility.[138] Also in 2011, Sporting Kansas City moved to new Livestrong 
Sporting Park, now Children's Mercy Park.[139] The Houston Dynamo relocated 
to their new home at BBVA Compass Stadium in 2012.[136] In the same year, 
the Montreal Impact joined the league in an expanded Stade Saputo, which 
reopened in June 2012, when renovations pushed the seating capacity to 
over 20,000. The Impact has used Olympic Stadium for early season matches 
and for games that require a larger capacity.[140] The San Jose Earthquakes, 
who had played at Buck Shaw Stadium from 2008 until 2014, opened their 
new Avaya Stadium before the 2015 season.[141] The development of additional 
MLS stadiums is in progress. The Orlando City SC expansion team intended 
to begin constructing Orlando City Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium, 
in 2014 to be completed in 2015.[142] Delays caused by changes to the stadium 
plans pushed back the new venue's opening, first to late in the 2016 season 
and finally to the start of the 2017 season.[143] Orlando City have been 
playing at the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium, now Camping World Stadium, 
while awaiting the opening of their new venue. Three teams have announced 
their desire to build a soccer-specific stadium, although these teams have 
not finalized the stadium site and received all necessary government approvals. 
D.C. United plays home games at a former NFL and Major League Baseball 
venue, RFK Stadium; in 2013, D.C. United announced the signing of a public-private 
partnership term sheet to build a 25,000-seat new soccer stadium in Washington, 
D.C., and a final deal was reached in late 2014.[144] The New York City 
FC expansion team plays home games at Yankee Stadium, a Major League Baseball 
venue, although they intend to move into a soccer-specific stadium in the 
future. The New England Revolution play home games at a National Football 
League venue, Gillette Stadium, but are currently in discussion with the 
City of Boston regarding a potential soccer-specific stadium in South Boston.[145] 
Several remaining clubs play in stadiums not originally built for MLS and 
have not announced plans to move. The Seattle Sounders play at CenturyLink 
Field, a dual-purpose facility used for both American football and soccer. 
The Vancouver Whitecaps FC joined the league with Portland in 2011 and 
temporarily held matches at Empire Field before moving into the refurbished 
BC Place in October 2011,[146] a retractable-roof stadium that hosts Canadian 
football as well as soccer.[147] Of the three confirmed future teams, two 
are building soccer-specific stadiums and the other will play in a shared 
football stadium. Minnesota United FC, debuting in 2017, is building an 
as yet-unnamed stadium in St. Paul and plans to open it for the 2018 season.[148] 
Until that time, the team will play in Minneapolis at TCF Bank Stadium, 
home to University of Minnesota football.[149] Los Angeles FC, entering 
in 2018, is currently building Banc of California Stadium on the former 
site of the Los Angeles Sports Arena and expects to open it in time for 
the team's debut.[150] Atlanta United, also entering in 2017, shares ownership 
with the NFL's Atlanta Falcons; the two teams will share the retractable-roof 
Mercedes-Benz Stadium once it opens during the 2017 MLS season. Due to 
construction delays, Atlanta United will play the first half of its inaugural 
season at another college football facility, namely Georgia Tech's Bobby 
Dodd Stadium.[151] As of the 2015 season, MLS matches are broadcast nationally 
by ESPN networks and Fox Sports in English, and Univision networks in Spanish 
under an eight-year contract. Each broadcaster has a window for national 
regular season matches, with UniMas airing a game on Friday nights in Spanish 
and additional matches on Univision Deportes Network, and ESPN and Fox 
Sports 1 airing games on Sunday evenings in English. ESPN, FS1, and Univision 
will share in coverage of the playoffs, while ESPN and FS1 will alternate 
broadcasting the MLS Cup final in English. In total, at least 125 matches 
will be aired per-season across all three networks, and the three contracts 
have an average estimated value of $90 million per season—five times larger 
than the average $18 million value of the previous contracts with ESPN, 
Univision, and NBC Sports.[152][153][153][154][155][156] 7.[157] Matches 
not televised nationally are broadcast regionally, often by regional sports 
networks, such as the LA Galaxy and Spectrum SportsNet.[76] From 2012 to 
2014, MLS matches were previously broadcast by NBC Sports, with 40 matches 
per year—primarily on NBCSN, and select matches broadcast on the NBC network.[158] 
The move from Fox Soccer to the more widely distributed NBCSN proved successful, 
with viewership numbers doubling for the 2012 season over those of Fox 
Soccer.[159] Coverage of MLS expanded into Canada in 2007 with the addition 
of Toronto FC. Currently, English-language national MLS broadcast rights 
in Canada are through the TSN networks with a six-year deal for the 2011–2016 
seasons. TSN and TSN2 broadcast a minimum of 30 games during each season, 
all featuring at least one Canadian team. French-language sister networks 
RDS and RDS2 have similar broadcast rights. The networks also carry additional 
games not involving Canadian teams.[160] GolTV Canada carries selected 
all-U.S. MLS matchups.[161] As in the United States, the individual Canadian 
teams also have separate broadcast deals for games not aired under the 
TSN/RDS national contract. TSN and Sportsnet split coverage of Toronto 
FC non-national games (TSN and Sportsnet's parent companies own a joint 
majority stake in the team through Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment), 
TVA Sports airs Montreal Impact games,[162] and TSN broadcasts the Vancouver 
Whitecaps in a separate deal.[163][164] MLS also entered into a four-year 
contract with Sky Sports to broadcast two MLS matches per week in the UK 
and Ireland from 2015–2019.[165] As part of the new agreement, Sky Sports 
will broadcast at least two MLS regular-season matches each week, as well 
as the AT&T MLS All-Star Game, every MLS Cup Playoff game, and the MLS 
Cup final. The matches will appear across Sky's family of networks. The 
UK-based broadcaster will also carry weekly MLS highlights across various 
platforms, including Sky Sports News and SkySports.com. Sky Sports will 
also broadcast at least one match from MLS's new "Decision Day" – the recently 
announced format change for the final day of the MLS regular season, during 
which all Eastern Conference games will be played simultaneously at 5 pm 
ET (9 pm UK time) followed by all Western Conference games at 7 pm ET (11 
pm UK time). Many of the matches are expected to determine the final spots 
for the MLS Cup Playoffs. [166] Eurosport will also broadcast MLS between 
2015 and 2019, with four matches per week being screened live to its continental 
audience.[167] beIN SPORT to televise league matches live across Southeast 
Asia and Australia. The agreement runs from the 2015-18 seasons in Australia, 
Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, and Thailand. At least 
two MLS regular season matches will be aired per week, as well as the AT&T 
MLS All-Star Game, at least two matches from the newly created Decision 
Day, all MLS Cup Playoff games and MLS Cup. In addition, beIN SPORTS will 
carry highlights, player features, and other MLS content across its digital 
platforms. [168] Major League Soccer is a playable league in both the FIFA 
and the Football Manager series. The league made its video game debut in 
1999 with FIFA 2000. In 2001, Konami released ESPN MLS ExtraTime 2002, 
which, to date, is the only soccer title to be based solely on MLS. The 
league made its first appearance in the management series Football Manager 
2005 in 2004.[169] Major League Soccer began to demonstrate positive signs 
of long-term profitability as early as 2004 with the single-entity ownership 
structure, salary cap, and the media and marketing umbrella Soccer United 
Marketing (SUM) all contributing towards MLS's financial security.[53] 
As soccer-specific stadiums are built, ownership expands, and television 
coverage increases, MLS has seen its revenues increase while controlling 
costs.[12] Television coverage and revenue have increased since the league's 
early years. In 2006, MLS reached an 8-year TV deal with ESPN spanning 
the 2007–2014 seasons, and marked the first time that MLS earned rights 
fees, reported to be worth $7–8 million annually.[170] In September 2012 
the league extended its distribution agreement with London-based Media 
rights agency MP & Silva until 2014 in a deal worth $10 million annually. 
Total league TV revenues are over $40 million annually.[171][172] In 2011, 
MLS earned $150 million when it sold a 25% stake in SUM.[12] In early 2005, 
MLS signed a 10-year, $150 million sponsorship deal with Adidas.[53] In 
2007, MLS teams started selling ad space on the front of jerseys to go 
along with the league-wide sponsorship partners who had already been advertising 
on the back of club jerseys, following the practice of international sport, 
specifically soccer. MLS established a floor of $500,000 per shirt sponsorship, 
with the league receiving a flat fee of $200,000 per deal.[193] As of July 
2014, sixteen teams had signed sponsorship deals to have company logos 
placed on the front of their jerseys (and another team is directly owned 
by its shirt sponsor), and the league average from jersey sponsors was 
about $2.4 million.[194] As of February 2016, all teams in MLS have jersey 
sponsors. The Los Angeles Galaxy made a profit in 2003 in their first season 
at The Home Depot Center,[52] and FC Dallas turned a profit after moving 
into Pizza Hut Park in 2005.[195] For each season between 2006–2009, two 
to three MLS clubs (generally clubs with a soccer-specific stadium) were 
reported as profitable by the league.[195][196][197] By 2012, the league 
had shown a marked improvement in its financial health. In November 2013, 
Forbes published its first valuation of MLS teams since 2008, and revealed 
that ten of the league's nineteen teams earned an operating profit in 2012, 
while two broke even and seven had a loss. Forbes estimated that the league's 
collective annual revenues were $494 million, and that the league's collective 
annual profit was $34 million. Forbes valued the league's franchises to 
be worth $103 million on average, almost three times as much as the $37 million 
average valuation in 2008. The Seattle Sounders FC franchise was named 
the most valuable at $175 million, a 483% gain over the $30 million league 
entrance fee it paid in 2009.[102] The trend in increased team values has 
continued with MLS teams seeing a strong 52% increase in franchise values 
from 2012 to 2014. In August 2015, Forbes released the updated list of 
MLS franchise values with the most profitable team weighing in at $245 
million and the least at $105 million. The average value jumped from $103 
to $157 million.[13] From 2015 to 2016 the league saw an increase of 18% 
of the average value of the MLS franchises. The most profitable one weighted 
in at $285 million and the least at $110 million. The average value in 
2016 is $185 million.[198] MLS follows the rules and standards of the International 
Football Association Board (IFAB). The playoff extra time structure follows 
IFAB standards: two full 15-minute periods, followed by a penalty shootout 
if necessary. Away goals apply to the playoff stage of the competition, 
but do not apply to overtime in the second leg of any two-legged playoff 
series.[199] U.S. Soccer hired the first full-time professional referees 
in league history in 2007 as part of the league's "Game First" initiatives.[200] 
Major League Soccer has been implementing fines and suspensions since the 
2011 season for simulation (diving) through its Disciplinary Committee, 
which reviews plays after the match. The first player fined under the new 
rule was Charlie Davies, fined $1,000 for intentionally deceiving match 
officials.[201] Originally, in the style of other U.S. sports leagues, 
teams were given nicknames at their creation. Examples include the Columbus 
Crew, the San Jose Clash and the Los Angeles Galaxy. Several of the club 
names in MLS originated with earlier professional soccer clubs, such as 
the 1970s-era NASL team names San Jose Earthquakes, Seattle Sounders, Portland 
Timbers and Vancouver Whitecaps.[202] D.C. United and Miami Fusion F.C. 
were the only two MLS teams to adopt European naming conventions during 
the 1990s.[203] However, European-style names have increased in MLS, with 
expansion teams such as Real Salt Lake and Toronto FC, in addition to 2015 
entrants New York City FC and Orlando City S.C., along with several re-brandings 
such as the Dallas Burn (now FC Dallas) and Kansas City Wizards (now Sporting 
Kansas City).[204] The beverage company Red Bull GmbH owns the New York 
Red Bulls as well as other sports teams.[98] Statistics below are for all-time
