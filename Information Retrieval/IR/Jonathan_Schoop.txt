Jonathan Rufino Jezus Schoop (/skoʊp/ skohp;[1] born October 16, 1991) 
is a Curaçaoan professional baseball second baseman for the Baltimore Orioles 
of Major League Baseball. Before he became a major leaguer, he played in 
the 2003 and 2004 Little League World Series for Curaçao. Schoop was signed 
by the Baltimore Orioles as a free agent in 2008. In 2011, Schoop along 
with Manny Machado represented the Orioles at the 2011 All-Star Futures 
Game.[2] He was awarded the Brooks Robinson Minor League Player of the 
Year, given to the best player in the Orioles minor league system.[3][4] 
During his minor league career, Schoop was primarily a shortstop. Schoop 
played for the Netherlands national baseball team at the 2012 European 
Baseball Championship.[5] Prior to the 2012 season, Schoop was ranked by 
Baseball America as the Orioles third best prospect and the 82nd best overall.[6][7] 
Schoop was recalled by the Orioles from the Triple-A Norfolk Tides on September 
3, 2013.[8] In his first major league at-bat on September 25, 2013, Schoop 
hit a single off Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Esmil Rogers. Two at-bats later, 
he hit his first career home run off Kyle Drabek, with a distance measured 
at 430 feet. He finished the game 2-for-3 with a home run, an RBI, a walk, 
and 3 runs scored.[9] In 5 Major League games, Schoop finished the year 
with 4 hits, a home run and an RBI. Schoop played in five games at the 
end of the year and hit .286 (4-for-14), scoring five runs, hitting one 
homerun, and driving in one run. On April 9, 2014, Schoop hit the second 
home run of his career off of Yankees RHP Masahiro Tanaka, a towering three-run 
shot over the left field foul pole at Yankee Stadium helping the Orioles 
to a 5-4 victory. In 137 games of 2014, Schoop batted .209 with 16 home 
runs and 45 RBI. With the Orioles finishing 96-66, the team clinched their 
first regular season AL East championship since 1997. Schoop hit .300 in 
the Orioles ALDS sweep of the Detroit Tigers, while also driving in two 
runs. In the ALCS, however, Schoop only hit .091 (1-for-11), as the Orioles 
were swept by the Kansas City Royals On April 11, 2015, Schoop hit his 
first career grand slam, off of Toronto Blue Jays reliever, Todd Redmond. 
[10] During a game against the Boston Red Sox on April 17, 2015, Schoop 
sustained a partially torn PCL and sprained MCL, which forced the Orioles 
to place him on the disabled list.[11] Schoop would end up playing in 86 
games during the 2015 season, collecting 85 hits (.279), 17 doubles, 15 
homeruns, 39 RBIs, and two steals in as many attempts. In 387 total chances, 
Schoop only committed seven errors for a .982 fielding percentage. The 
Orioles finished the season with an 81-81 record and missed out on the 
postseason. Schoop got off to a hot start and in his first ten games, hit 
.351 while hitting three home runs and driving in eight. By the end of 
April, he had hit four home runs, driven in 11, and hit .256. Schoop hit 
his first grand slam of the season on May 14 in a 9-3 comeback victory 
over the Tigers. It was Schoop's second home run of the game, and he drove 
in a total of five runs. On August 14, Schoop hit a go-ahead three run 
home run against San Francisco Giants closer Santiago Casilla in the top 
of the 9th inning to complete a seven run comeback for the Orioles, having 
trailed 7-1 prior to the 7th inning. Schoop hit his 20th home run of the 
season on August 22, his first career 20-homer season. He became the fifth 
Oriole on the year to have at least 20 home runs, making the Orioles the 
only Major League club to accomplish this feat on the year. On August 31, 
Schoop hit his 21st home run of the season, and the 55th of the month for 
the Orioles, tying an MLB record just two months after setting the home 
run record in June. Baltimore became the first team to hit 55+ home runs 
in a month on two occasions. Schoop hit his 25th home run of the season 
on September 30 against the Yankees, making him the fifth Oriole on the 
year with at least 25 homers. This tied the franchise record from 1996. 
They also became just the 12th team in MLB history to do so. It was also 
the Orioles 250th home run of the season, passing the 2000 Houston Astros 
for fifth most home runs in a single-season all-time. He finished the 2016 
season with 38 doubles, 25 home runs, 82 RBI and batted .267/.298/.454 
while starting all 162 regular season games, and the AL Wild Card game 
against the Toronto Blue Jays. Schoop competed in the Little League World 
Series twice on the Pabao Little League team from Willemstad. After a third 
place finish in 2003, Schoop helped the team win the championship in 2004.
