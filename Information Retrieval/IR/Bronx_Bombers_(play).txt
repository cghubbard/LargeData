Bronx Bombers is a play written by Eric Simonson, and produced by Fran 
Kirmser and Tony Ponturo, in conjunction with the New York Yankees and 
Major League Baseball. The play focuses on former Yankee Yogi Berra and 
his wife, Carmen, as they interact with other Yankees from different eras. 
It made its Broadway debut on February 6, 2014 and closed on March 2, 2014. 
Kirmser and Ponturo met while working on the 2009 Broadway revival of Hair. 
Bronx Bombers is the third play produced by Kirmser and Ponturo to focus 
on sports, following Lombardi, which followed American football head coach 
Vince Lombardi, and Magic/Bird, which focused on basketball players Magic 
Johnson and Larry Bird. Ponturo, who worked in sports marketing before 
theatre, worked with Major League Baseball (MLB) executives, which enabled 
him to gain an "endorsement of authenticity" from MLB and the New York 
Yankees, to write a play about the Yankees franchise.[1] Kirmser and Ponturo 
sat down with Yogi Berra and his wife, Carmen, to discuss writing a play 
where the plot would center around them, gaining their approval.[2] Bronx 
Bombers began as an Off-Broadway production, premiering at Primary Stages. 
It ran from September 20 through October 19, 2013.[3] Present day Yankees 
Mark Teixeira and CC Sabathia promoted the show on Late Night with Jimmy 
Fallon.[1] Previews for the Broadway production began on January 10, 2014,[4] 
and it made its official debut on Broadway at the Circle in the Square 
Theatre on February 6, 2014.[1] The play was able to recoup only a quarter 
of its potential box office take of $733,260.[5] The play closed on March 
2, 2014, after 29 regular performances.[6] The show begins in 1977, the 
day after Reggie Jackson and Billy Martin engaged in a near-brawl during 
a game. Berra attempts to bring Jackson and Martin back together, with 
the help of other Yankees stars.[2][7] In the first scene, Berra brings 
Martin and Jackson, with team captain Thurman Munson, to his hotel room 
to settle their argument. Berra spends the night with his wife discussing 
the problem. Berra then has a dream where he and his wife have dinner with 
Yankees' greats Joe DiMaggio, Elston Howard, Mickey Mantle, Lou Gehrig, 
Babe Ruth, and Derek Jeter.[8] Peter Scolari and Tracy Shayne star as Yogi 
Berra and his wife, Carmen. Scolari and Shayne were married in 2013.[9] 
Richard Topol and Wendy Makkena played Yogi and Carmen Berra in the Off-Broadway 
production. Joe Pantoliano was cast in the role of Yogi Berra for the Broadway 
production,[10] but he dropped out during rehearsals due to "creative differences".[11] 
The play features cameos of other famous Yankees.[1] In both the Off-Broadway 
and Broadway productions, C. J. Wilson plays Ruth, Christopher Jackson 
plays Jeter, Francois Battiste plays both Jackson and Howard, Chris Henry 
Coffey plays DiMaggio, Bill Dawes plays Mantle and Munson, Keith Nobbs
