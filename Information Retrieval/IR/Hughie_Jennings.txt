Hugh Ambrose Jennings (April 2, 1869 – February 1, 1928) was a Major League 
Baseball player and manager from 1891 to 1925. Jennings was a leader, both 
as a batter and as a shortstop, with the Baltimore Orioles teams that won 
National League championships in 1894, 1895, and 1896. During those three 
seasons, Jennings had 355 runs batted in and hit .335, .386, and .401. 
Jennings was a fiery, hard-nosed player who was not afraid to be hit by 
a pitch to get on base. In 1896, he was hit by pitches 51 times – a major 
league record that has never been broken. Jennings also holds the career 
record for being hit by pitches with 287, with Craig Biggio (who retired 
in 2007) holding the modern-day career record of 285. Jennings also played 
on the Brooklyn Superbas teams that won National League pennants in 1899 
and 1900. From 1907 to 1920, Jennings was the manager of the Detroit Tigers, 
where he was known for his colorful antics, hoots, whistles, and his famous 
shouts of "Ee-Yah" from the third base coaching box. Jennings suffered 
a nervous breakdown in 1925 that forced him to leave Major League Baseball.[1] 
He died in 1928 and was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of 
Fame in 1945. Born in Pittston, Pennsylvania, Jennings was the son of Irish 
immigrants, James and Nora, who according to Jack Smiles's biography of 
Jennings, Ee-yah: The Life and Times of Hughie Jennings, Baseball Hall 
of Famer (page 7), arrived in Pittston in 1851. Jennings worked as a breaker 
boy (young boys who separated the coal from the slate) in the local anthracite 
coal mines. He drew attention playing shortstop for a semi-professional 
baseball team in Lehighton, Pennsylvania in 1890.[1] He was signed by the 
Louisville Colonels of the American Association in 1891. He stayed with 
the Colonels when they joined the National League in 1892 and was traded 
on June 7, 1893 to the Baltimore Orioles. Jennings played with the Orioles 
for parts of seven seasons and became a star during his years in Baltimore. 
The Baltimore Orioles teams of 1894, 1895, and 1896 are regarded as one 
of the greatest teams of all time. The teams featured Hall of Fame manager 
Ned Hanlon and a lineup with six future Hall of Famers: first baseman Dan 
Brouthers, second baseman John McGraw, shortstop Jennings, catcher Wilbert 
Robinson, right fielder "Wee Willie" Keeler, and left fielder Joe Kelley. 
Amidst all those great players, Jennings was appointed captain in 1894, 
his first full season with the team. During the Orioles' championship years, 
Jennings had some of the best seasons ever by a major league shortstop. 
In 1895, he hit .386, scored 159 runs, collected 204 hits, knocked in 125 
runs, and stole 53 bases. In 1896, his performance was even better, as 
he hit .401 (2nd best in the National League) with 209 hits, 121 RBIs, 
and 70 stolen bases. The fiery Jennings was also known as one of the most 
fearless players of his time, allowing himself to be hit by pitches more 
than any other player. In one game, he was hit by a pitch three times. 
In 1896, he was hit by pitches 51 times—a Major League record that still 
stands. In just five seasons with the Orioles from 1894–1898, Jennings 
was hit by pitches an unprecedented 202 times. During one game, Jennings 
was hit in the head by a pitch from Amos Rusie in the 3rd inning, but managed 
to finish the game. As soon as the game ended, Jennings collapsed and was 
unconscious for three days.[2][3] Jennings was also one of the best fielding 
shortstops of the era. He led the National League in fielding percentage 
and putouts three times each. He had as many as 537 assists and 425 putouts 
in single seasons during his prime. His 425 putouts ties him with Donie 
Bush for the single season record for a shortstop. In 1895, he had a career-high 
range factor of 6.73–1.19 points higher than the league average (5.54) 
for shortstops that year. He once handled 20 chances in a game, and on 
another occasion had 10 assists in a game. In 1898, he threw his arm out, 
and his career as a shortstop came to an end. After that, Jennings was 
forced to move to first base.[1] In 1899, when manager Ned Hanlon moved 
to the Brooklyn Superbas, several of his star players, including Jennings, 
Joe Kelley, and Willie Keeler followed. While Jennings was never the same 
after the injury to his arm in 1898, he contributed to Brooklyn's National 
League pennants in 1899 and 1900.[1] In 1901, Jennings was traded to the 
Philadelphia Phillies. However, his failing arm cut his career short, as 
he never played in more than 82 games or hit above .272 in two seasons 
with the Phillies. Jennings played 6 games for the Superbas in 1903, effectively 
ending his playing career, with the exception of 9 at bats during his tenure 
as the manager of the Detroit Tigers. While playing for the Orioles in 
the 1890s, Jennings and John McGraw both attended classes at St. Bonaventure 
University. After the 1899 season, Jennings was accepted to Cornell Law 
School. He managed the Cornell University baseball team while studying 
law and concluded that he was well-suited to being a manager.[4] While 
at Cornell, he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity chapter there. Jennings 
continued as a scholar-athlete until the spring of 1904, when he left campus 
early to manage the Orioles. Though he never finished his law degree at 
Cornell, Jennings passed the Maryland bar exam in 1905 and started a law 
practice.[1][3] He continued to work at his law practice during the off-seasons 
through the remainder of his baseball career. In 1907, Jennings was hired 
as manager of a talented Detroit Tigers team that included future Hall 
of Famers Ty Cobb and Sam Crawford. Jennings led the Tigers to three consecutive 
American League pennants, in 1907–1908-1909. However, Jennings' teams lost 
the 1907 and 1908 World Series to the "Tinker to Evers to Chance" Chicago 
Cubs and the 1909 Series to Honus Wagner's Pittsburgh Pirates. Jennings 
continued to manage the Tigers through the 1920 season, though his teams 
never won another pennant. During his years as Detroit's manager, Jennings 
became famous for his antics, mostly in the third base coaching box, which 
variously included shouts of "Ee-Yah", and other whoops, whistles, horns, 
gyrations, jigs, and grass-plucking. The "Ee-Yah" whoop became his trademark 
and was accompanied with waves of both arms over his head and a sharp raising 
of his right knee.[1] In 1907, he was suspended for taunting opponents 
with a tin whistle.[3] The "Ee-Yah" shouts continued and became such a 
trademark that Jennings became known as Hughie "Ee-Yah" Jennings, and Detroit 
fans would shout "Ee-Yah" when Jennings appeared on the field.[2][4] (See 
also Jack Smile, Ee-yah: The Life And Times Of Hughie Jennings, Baseball 
Hall Of Famer) Behind the antics was a great coaching mind. Connie Mack 
called Jennings one of the three greatest managers in history, along with 
John McGraw and Joe McCarthy.[2] One of his greatest challenges, and accomplishments, 
during his years in Detroit was to manage the unmanageable—Ty Cobb. Jennings 
recognized Cobb's talent and his complicated psychological makeup and concluded 
the best strategy would be to let Cobb be Cobb. Jennings reportedly called 
Cobb aside one day and said, "There isn't anything about baseball I can 
teach you. Anything I might say to you would merely hinder you in your 
development. The only thing for you to do is go ahead and do as you please. 
Use your own judgment.. . . . . Do what you think is best and I'll back 
you up."[2] In 1912, during a game in which "pick-ups" played for the Tigers 
when the regular team went on strike to protest the suspension of Cobb 
after an incident involving a fan in the stands whom Cobb assaulted, Jennings, 
who also sent his coaches in as substitute players, came to bat himself 
once as a pinch hitter. According to one source, when the umpire asked 
him for whom he was batting, Jennings answered, "None of your business." 
The umpire noted on his lineup sheet, "Jennings--batted for exercise."[5] 
While Jennings was fiery, hard-nosed, colorful, and even eccentric, he 
insisted he had always played the game honestly. When a scandal arose in 
1926 concerning whether Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker had fixed a 1919 game 
between the Detroit and the Cleveland Indians while Jennings was the manager, 
Jennings initially spoke of how easy it would be to fix a game and issued 
a "no comment" on the specific game. After his "no comment" drew negative 
publicity, Jennings issued a statement to the press in December 1926 denying 
knowledge of the matter and adding, "My slate has been clean base ball 
for 35 years... Whatever I have done in base ball has been of such a nature 
that I would be ready any time to go before anyone and place my case before 
them."[6] After the 1920 season, Jennings stepped down as the Tigers' manager. 
His 1,131 wins was the most in Tigers history until Sparky Anderson passed 
him in 1992. Jennings signed on as a coach with his old friend, John McGraw, 
who was managing the New York Giants. Jennings and McGraw, who met as teammates 
on the Orioles, became close friends. Jennings was the best man at McGraw's 
wedding and a pallbearer following the death of McGraw's 23-year-old wife 
in 1899.[7] McGraw and Jennings staged a reunion year after year on their 
birthdays.[1][4] Jennings won two World Series as a coach in 1921 and 1922. 
When McGraw became ill, Jennings filled in as the Giants' manager for parts 
of 1924 and 1925. His overall managing record was 1184-995.[8] Jennings' 
life was filled with several tragic accidents. There was the beaning incident 
in Philadelphia that left him unconscious for three days. While attending 
Cornell, he fractured his skull diving head-first into a swimming pool 
at night, only to find the pool had been emptied.[1][2] In December 1911, 
Jennings came close to death after an off-season automobile accident. While 
driving a car given to him by admirers, Jennings' car overturned while 
crossing a bridge over the Lehigh River near Gouldsboro, 23 miles southeast 
of Scranton. In the crash, Jennings again fractured his skull, suffered 
a concussion of the brain, and broke both legs and his left arm. For several 
days after the accident, doctors were unsure if Jennings would survive.[1][4] 
The physical abuse and blows to the head undoubtedly took their toll. During 
the 1925 season, McGraw was ill, and Jennings was put in full charge of 
the Giants. The team finished in second place and the strain caught up 
with Jennings, who suffered a nervous breakdown when the season ended.[1][4] 
According to his obituary, Jennings "was unable to report" to spring training 
in 1926 due to his condition. Jennings retired to the Winyah Sanatorium 
in Asheville, North Carolina. He did return home to Scranton, Pennsylvania, 
spending much of his time recuperating in the Pocono Mountains.[4] In early 
1928, Jennings died from meningitis in Scranton, Pennsylvania at age 58.[1] 
Jennings was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 as a player.
