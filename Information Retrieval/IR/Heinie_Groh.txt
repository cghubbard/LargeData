1927)* Led the National League in walks (84) in 1916 Henry Knight "Heinie" 
Groh (September 18, 1889 – August 22, 1968) was an American professional 
baseball player. He played as a third baseman in Major League Baseball, 
spending nearly his entire career with the Cincinnati Reds and New York 
Giants. He was the National League's top third baseman in the late 1910s 
and early 1920s, and captained championship teams with the 1919 Reds and 
1922 Giants. Renowned for his "bottle bat", he was an effective leadoff 
hitter, batting .300 four times and leading the league in doubles twice 
and in hits, runs and walks once each. He led the National League in double 
plays six times and in fielding percentage five times, both records, and 
in putouts three times; his .983 fielding average in 1924 was then a major 
league record, and remains the top mark in NL history. He set major league 
records for career fielding average (.967) and double plays (278), and 
upon retiring ranked third in NL history in games (1299) and assists (2554) 
and fourth in putouts (1456) and total chances (4146) at third base. His 
brother Lew played two games for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1919. Born 
in Rochester, New York, to German immigrant parents Louis and Ernestine 
Schneider Groh, Heinie Groh was a premier third baseman in the dead-ball 
era, during a period when both the playing fields and the players were 
rough. He made his debut as a second baseman with the Giants in 1912, playing 
for John McGraw and with star pitcher Christy Mathewson. At 5 feet 8 inches 
and 158 pounds, he appeared younger than his 23 years; in his first major 
league at bat, umpire Bill Klem questioned whether McGraw had mistakenly 
sent a batboy to the plate, but Groh came through with a base hit. It was 
McGraw who suggested that Groh use a heavier bottle-style bat, though Groh 
shaved the handle down even further for better weight distribution and 
became a skilled bunter. But after just 31 games with the Giants, he was 
traded to the Reds in May 1913, and finished his rookie year with a .282 
average. He improved to .288 in 1914 and led the league in times hit by 
pitch, but also led the league in errors at second base, and manager Buck 
Herzog – who had played both second and third base himself – shifted Groh 
to third base permanently in 1915. The move was spectacularly successful, 
as Groh not only hit .290 with 32 doubles and 170 hits, but set a new league 
record with 34 double plays, breaking Lave Cross' 1899 mark of 32; he also 
finished within a fraction of a point of Bobby Byrne for the lead in fielding 
average at .969. On July 5, he hit for the cycle against the Chicago Cubs, 
becoming the only player to do so between 1913 and 1917; no Red would do 
so again until 1940. In 1916 he led the league in both walks (84) and double 
plays (32), and was among the top five NL players in runs and triples. 
In 1917 he batted .304, with a 23-game hitting streak, and led the NL in 
putouts (178) and fielding average (.966); his 39 doubles led the NL, and 
fell just short of Cy Seymour's 1905 club record of 40. He also led the 
league in hits (182) and on-base percentage (.385), and was second in runs 
(91), walks (71) and total bases (246) and sixth in slugging average (.411). 
1918 was an even better season in various ways, as despite a season curtailed 
by World War I and the influenza epidemic, he tied Billy Nash's 1890 major 
league record of 37 double plays, also leading the league in putouts (180) 
and fielding average (.969); Pie Traynor would set a new record with 41 
double plays for the 1925 Pittsburgh Pirates. Groh hit .320 (third in the 
league), led the NL in runs (86), doubles (28) and on-base percentage (.395), 
and was second in hits (158) and third in walks (54) and total bases (195). 
He also managed the team for its final ten games (with a 7-3 record) after 
Mathewson entered the military. The 1919 team marked the peak of his Cincinnati 
years, with the team winning its first pennant since its 1882 inaugural 
season in the American Association. Groh again led the NL with 171 putouts 
and 22 double plays, was fourth in the league with a .310 batting average, 
and was among the top five players in runs (79), runs batted in (63), on-base 
percentage (.392), slugging (.431) and walks (56), even though he missed 
much of September with an injury. The Reds went on to defeat the favored 
Chicago White Sox in the scandal-tainted World Series; after the Chicago 
players were discredited as having fixed the Series, Groh was famously 
quoted as saying "I think we'd have beaten them either way." In Game 1, 
Groh – batting third in the Series – drove in the first run of the Series 
on a sacrifice fly, and also had an RBI single in the 9-1 win. He scored 
in the 4-2 Game 2 victory, and also scored a disputed run in the 5-0 Game 
5 win; White Sox catcher Ray Schalk was thrown out of the game for complaining 
about the call. In the final Game 8 (it being a best-of-nine Series), he 
had a single and scored in the 4-run first inning, and singled and scored 
again in the second as the Reds cruised to a 10-5 win and their first Series 
championship. In 1920 he slipped slightly to a .298 average, posting solid 
totals in walks, runs and doubles, and led the NL in double plays for the 
fifth time with 30. He batted .331 in 1921, but was bothered by injuries 
throughout the year. He had begun the year with a long contract holdout, 
only joining the team in June for $10,000 (less than the $12,000 he had 
requested) on the condition that he would be immediately traded to the 
Giants. A deal was completed to send him back to New York, where McGraw 
had long been trying to re-acquire him; but Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain 
Landis cancelled the trade, requiring that Groh complete the year with 
the Reds. In December, after the Giants had won the World Series, he was 
finally sent to New York for two players and cash (varying reports give 
amounts from $100,000 to $250,000). Although his batting marks were never 
the same with the Giants as they had been with the Reds, he posted good 
batting averages with over 20 doubles in each of his three full seasons 
in New York. In 1922 he led the NL in double plays (25) for the sixth and 
last time, and also in fielding average (.965) for the third time; in that 
year he broke Nash's NL record of 220 career double plays. His season highlights 
came in the World Series against the New York Yankees, as he batted .474 
in the five-game sweep (four wins and a tie). Batting second, he was 3-for-3 
with a triple in Game 1, singling and scoring in a 3-run eighth-inning 
rally that propelled the team to a 3-2 win. He singled twice and scored 
in a 3-0 win in Game 3, and singled and scored again in a 4-run fifth inning 
in Game 4, with New York hanging on for a 4-3 triumph. In Game 5, he singled 
with one out in the eighth inning to start a 3-run rally that gave the 
Giants their final 5-3 lead, although he was thrown out at the plate in 
the inning. For the rest of his life, Groh maintained the Ohio license 
plate number 474. He also noted that he had figured out the Yankees' signs, 
saying, "I knew when they were going to bunt and when they were going to 
hit away. Which is a very nice thing for a third baseman to know." Although 
his fielding range had declined, Groh continued to better his accuracy. 
In 1923 he set a league record with a .975 fielding average, topping Hans 
Lobert's 1913 mark of .974; he also hit .290 during the season. The Giants 
won the pennant again, becoming the first team to remain in first place 
all season, but lost the World Series in six games to the Yankees, with 
Groh batting only .182. In 1924 he bettered his own mark by setting a new 
major league record with a .983 fielding average, breaking Larry Gardner's 
record of .976 with the 1920 Cleveland Indians. Willie Kamm would set a 
new record of .984 with the 1933 White Sox, but Groh's mark remains the 
best by an NL third baseman. In 1924 Groh also broke Nash's major league 
record of 265 career double plays, and again led the league in times being 
hit by a pitch. The Giants went to the World Series for the fourth straight 
year, but lost again to the Washington Senators in seven games. Groh, who 
had suffered a knee injury late in the season, made just a single pinch-hitting 
appearance, singling in 11th inning of the final game; the Giants lost 
4-3 in the 12th when, with one out and runners on first and second, Earl 
McNeely hit a ground ball to rookie third baseman Freddie Lindstrom which 
apparently struck a pebble and bounced over his head for a double. Groh 
appeared in a limited role for the Giants in each of the next two years, 
and ended his career with the Pirates in 1927. His final major league appearance 
was as a pinch-hitter in the ninth inning of Game 3 of the 1927 World Series 
against the Yankees, in which the Pirates were swept; he popped up to pitcher 
Herb Pennock. Groh retired with a .292 batting average, 1774 hits, 918 
runs, 566 RBI, 26 home runs, 308 doubles, 696 walks and 180 stolen bases 
in 1676 games. His career fielding average was later topped by Kamm, and 
remained an NL record until Ken Reitz surpassed it in 1979; Traynor broke 
his record for career double plays in 1933. Groh's 1299 games at third 
base trailed only Harry Steinfeldt (1386) and Milt Stock (1349) in NL history. 
Groh became a minor league manager as well as a scout after retiring as 
a player. He later worked as a racetrack cashier, and was among the baseball 
figures interviewed for the landmark 1966 book The Glory of Their Times.[1] 
He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1963, and died 
at age 78 in Cincinnati.[2] He is interred in Spring Grove Cemetery in
