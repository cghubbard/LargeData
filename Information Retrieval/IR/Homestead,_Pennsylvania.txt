Homestead is a borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, USA, in the Monongahela 
River valley 7 miles (11 km) southeast of downtown Pittsburgh and directly 
across the river from the city limit line. The borough is known for the 
Homestead Strike of 1892, an important event in the history of labor relations 
in the United States. The population of Homestead was 3,165 at the 2010 
census.[1] The area on the south bank of the Monongahela River now comprising 
the boroughs of Homestead, Munhall and West Homestead saw the first white 
settlers arrive in the 1770s. One hundred years later, much of the existing 
farmland on the flats and hillsides by the river was purchased, laid out 
in lots and sold by local banks and land owners to create the town of Homestead. 
The town was chartered in 1880. The building of a railroad, glass factory, 
and in 1881 the first iron mill began a period of rapid growth and prosperity. 
In 1883, Andrew Carnegie bought out Homestead Steel Works, adding it to 
his empire of steel and coke enterprises. Carnegie had recently acquired 
a controlling interest in Henry Clay Frick's coke works on the Monongahela, 
setting the stage for the dramatic labor clash in Homestead. Homestead 
gained international notoriety in July 1892 as the site of a violent clash 
between locked-out steelworkers and hired Pinkerton guards, known as the 
Homestead Strike. When Henry Clay Frick, manager for Andrew Carnegie, owner 
of the local Homestead Steel Works, announced in the spring of 1892 that 
skilled workers would receive a reduction in wages, the advisory committee 
of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers refused to sign 
a new contract. Carnegie's management locked the workforce out, declaring 
that the union would no longer be recognized at the steel works. To break 
the strike and secure the mill from the disgruntled workers, industrialist 
Henry Clay Frick hired hundreds of armed toughs from the Pinkerton National 
Detective Agency. When barges carrying the Pinkertons arrived at the mill 
on the morning of July 6, workers and townspeople met them at the riverbanks. 
Though eyewitness accounts differed on which side first fired a shot, a 
day-long armed battle ensued which resulted in eleven deaths and dozens 
of injuries. The governor of Pennsylvania eventually called out the National 
Guard to restore order to the town and take control of the mill. Frick 
successfully destroyed the union in Homestead and, by extension, in most 
of his other steel mills through the nation. The "Battle of Homestead," 
as the event came to be known, represented a stunning setback for unionization 
in the highly mechanized steel industry. It also set the stage for the 
future steel strike of 1919, in which Homestead played an important role. 
At the turn of the 20th century, in 1900, the population of Homestead was 
12,554 people, of whom some 7,000 were employed in the plants. Due mostly 
to immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe, by 1910 the population 
jumped to 18,713, then to 20,452 in 1920. In the first decade of the 20th 
century, Homestead was studied as part of the sociological Pittsburgh Survey, 
the results of which were eventually published as Homestead: The Households 
of a Mill Town. In 1940, 19,041 people lived in Homestead. During the early 
1940s half the population was displaced as the United States government 
added to the steel mills to have the capacity for armor plating for ships 
and tanks (preparing for World War II). [2] After the end of the war, a 
decline in the steel-making industry of the United States took place. By 
1980, it had become difficult to obtain employment at the Homestead Works, 
which was not producing much steel at that time. In 1986, the mill closed. 
The Homestead Works was demolished in the early 1990s, replaced in 1999 
by The Waterfront shopping mall. As a direct result of the loss of mill 
employment, the number of people living in Homestead dwindled. By the time 
of the 2010 census, the borough population was 3,165. The borough began 
financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base. Homestead 
was the home of the Homestead Grays baseball team, one of the most successful 
teams in Negro League history. Homestead is located at 40°24′18″N 79°54′28″W﻿ 
/ ﻿40.40500°N 79.90778°W﻿ / 40.40500; -79.90778 (40.405069, −79.907785).[2] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area 
of 0.6 square miles (1.6 km2), of which 0.6 square miles (1.6 km2) is land 
and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2), or 11.11%, is water. As of the census[5] 
of 2000, there were 3,569 people, 1,607 households, and 843 families residing 
in the borough. The population density was 6,281.6 people per square mile 
(2,417.5/km²). There were 2,071 housing units at an average density of 
3,645.0 per square mile (1,402.8/km²). The racial makeup of the borough 
was 42.64% White, 51.30% African American, 0.25% Native American, 2.83% 
Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.22% from other races, and 2.72% from two 
or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.62% of the population. 
There were 1,607 households, out of which 24.4% had children under the 
age of 18 living with them, 23.3% were married couples living together, 
24.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 47.5% were 
non-families. 42.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 
19.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average 
household size was 2.16 and the average family size was 2.99. In the borough 
the population was spread out, with 24.2% under the age of 18, 8.0% from 
18 to 24, 25.1% from 25 to 44, 23.8% from 45 to 64, and 18.9% who were 
65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females 
there were 80.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 
75.1 males. The median income for a household in the borough was $16,603, 
and the median income for a family was $28,314. Males had a median income 
of $25,500 versus $21,559 for females. The per capita income for the borough 
was $12,690. About 23.0% of families and 26.6% of the population were below 
the poverty line, including 31.0% of those under age 18 and 16.8% of those 
age 65 or over. Also of interest is the Bost Building, a restored brick 
structure that served as headquarters for the strikers during the 1892 
strike by workers at Carnegie Steel. The Bost Building was declared a National 
Landmark in 1999. It is located at 621 East Eighth Avenue. It now houses 
a museum and visitors center of the Rivers of Steel Heritage Area. Much 
of Homestead and some of the surrounding communities are listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places as the Homestead Historic District. 
Many churches, commercial buildings, and homes date to the late 19th century 
or early 20th century and are of architectural and historic interest. Unfortunately, 
since the closing of the steel mills in the 1980s, the population and business 
district of Homestead have seriously declined, causing many older buildings 
to be abandoned. The final nail in the coffin of the formerly thriving 
business district, mainly along 8th Avenue, was the opening of many big 
box chain stores and restaurants in the new (1990s) Waterfront development. 
The Carnegie Library of Homestead was opened to the public in 1898. This 
historic building, located on East 11th Avenue in the neighboring borough 
of Munhall, now houses, in addition to a public library, a music hall and 
athletic club open to the public. The impressive stone architecture of 
the building is set off by the surrounding park. The library is one of 
only three that Andrew Carnegie provided with an endowment. Some claim 
it was a peace offering to the community following the events of the steel 
strike in 1892, and that as such it was rejected by Homestead, which is 
why it is in Munhall instead. In fact, the plans were already in the works 
for the building of the library before the strike, and the Borough of Munhall 
had not been incorporated when the library was built. Also not technically 
in Homestead proper, but located just west of the borough, is the popular 
waterpark, Sandcastle, with waterslides, pools and waterside nightclub 
adjacent to the Monongahela River. Sandcastle's sister location for summertime 
fun is Kennywood, located in West Mifflin, about 4 miles (6 km) east of 
Homestead. This historic amusement park has been a family destination for 
generations of Pittsburghers. It is home to some of the best known and 
loved wooden roller coaster rides. In 2000, Continental Realestate Companies 
opened The Waterfront. This large "lifestyle" shopping center was built 
on the former site of the Carnegie Steel Works. Most of the structures 
associated with the steel mills on this site were demolished during construction. 
Still standing in the Waterfront development are some of the brick stacks 
from the Homestead Steel Works. In addition, near the river is a former 
mill structure known as the Pump House which was restored by the developer. 
An important state route, Pennsylvania Route 837, runs through Homestead. 
Interstate 376 is only a few miles away from Homestead. For public transit, 
the Port Authority of Allegheny County has several bus routes running through 
Homestead that go to downtown Pittsburgh and to McKeesport. Homestead is 
served by three railroads: the Norfolk Southern, CSX Transportation and 
the Union Railroad. All three used to have large operations when the Homestead 
steel mill was open. Now that the mill has closed, only one company, WHEMCO, 
is served by the railroad. The Union Railroad had a large yard to serve 
the Homestead Works, which is now Waterfront Drive. Homestead Pennsylvania
