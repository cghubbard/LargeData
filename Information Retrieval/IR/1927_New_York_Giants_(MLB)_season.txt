The 1927 New York Giants season was the franchise's 45th season. The team 
finished third in the National League with a record of 92â€“62, 2 games behind 
the Pittsburgh Pirates. During the offseason, the Giants acquired Rogers 
Hornsby from the St. Louis Cardinals for Frankie Frisch and Jimmy Ring. 
Hornsby's offensive numbers rebounded in 1927, as he hit .361 and led the 
league in runs scored (133), walks (86), and an on-base percentage (.448). 
The deal was held up because Hornsby, as part of his contract as the manager 
of the Cardinals (he was a player-manager at the time), owned several shares 
of stock in the Cardinals. Cardinals owner Sam Breadon offered Hornsby 
a sum for the stock considerably lower than what Hornsby demanded for it, 
and neither would budge. Eventually, the other owners of the National League 
made up the difference, and the trade went through. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
