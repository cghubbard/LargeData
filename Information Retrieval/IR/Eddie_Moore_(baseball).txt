Graham Edward Moore (January 18, 1899 in Barlow, Kentucky â€“ February 10, 
1976 in Ft. Myers, Florida), is a former professional baseball player who 
played second base and outfield from 1923 to 1934 in the Major Leagues. 
Moore nearly usurped Pie Traynor's job as the starting third baseman for 
the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1924, his rookie season.[1] Traynor, mired in 
a terrible slump, was benched on June 18, and Moore batted .423 in his 
first 13 games at the position.[1] On the strength of this performance, 
manager Bill McKechnie declared Moore to be his starter going forward.[1] 
However, Moore was hit by a pitch from Johnny Stuart of the St. Louis Cardinals 
on July 1, suffering a dislocated shoulder, and Traynor took advantage 
of Moore's absence to re-solidify his hold on the position.[1] The next 
season, after Rabbit Maranville was traded to the Chicago Cubs, Moore became 
the Pirates' starting second baseman.[2] He injured his shoulder on May 
8, but was forced back into the lineup at less than full strength after 
only a few days of rest because the father of his backup, Johnny Rutledge, 
had died unexpectedly.[3] Moore was sold to the Boston Braves in 1926, 
after a confrontation with Fred Clarke, who was then working as the Pirates' 
assistant manager and head of scouting.[4] The trouble began during a doubleheader 
against the New York Giants on July 12.[4] Moore committed an error in 
the first game, and was booed by the crowd.[4] He had a habit of reflexively 
smiling during moments of stress, and when Clarke saw his grin, he took 
it to be a sign that Moore did not care about what he was doing.[4] The 
two got into a shouting match in the dugout after the end of the inning, 
with Moore telling Clarke to "get off the bench".[4] That game was Moore's 
last with the Pirates.[4] That evening, McKechnie fined Moore and pitcher 
Emil Yde for what he termed "indifferent play", and on July 20 the team 
sold Moore to the Braves.[4] On September 27, 1930, Moore became the last 
major-league player to hit a "bounce" home run.[5] (Prior to the 1931 season, 
a ball that bounced from the field of play into the outfield stands was 
considered a home run.) Moore helped lead the New Orleans Pelicans to a 
Southern Association championship in 1933, batting .309 as the team's starting
