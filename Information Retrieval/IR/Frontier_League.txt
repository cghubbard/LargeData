The Frontier League, based in Sauget, Illinois, is a professional, independent 
baseball organization located in the Midwestern United States. It operates 
mostly in cities not served by Major or Minor League Baseball teams and 
is not affiliated with either. The league was formed in 1993, and is the 
oldest currently running independent league. The 2016 season will feature 
12 teams in two divisions playing 96 game schedules.[1] Teams in the Frontier 
League must recruit and sign their own players, who usually are undrafted 
college players or one-time prospects who have been released by their teams. 
Frontier League rules limit teams to three "veterans" (those with three 
or more years of professional experience), two two-year players and seven 
one-year players (those with at least 150 professional at-bats or 50 innings 
pitched). The other half of the 24-man roster is confined to rookies. Players 
cannot be older than 27 as of January 1. Pay in the Frontier League is 
minimal. As of the 2013 season, each team has a salary cap of $75,000,[2] 
and the player salaries range from a minimum of $600 up to $1600 a month. 
Due to the low pay, players typically live with host families and receive 
meal money during the season. The first league champions were the Zanesville 
Greys. Only five teams have won more than one championship: Springfield 
in 1996 and 1998, Johnstown in 1995 (as the Steal) and in 2000 (as the 
Johnnies), Richmond (now Traverse City) in 2001 and 2002, Windy City in 
2007 and 2008, and the Schaumburg Boomers in 2013 and 2014. The Florence 
Freedom (including years as Erie and Johnstown) and the Rockford RiverHawks 
(including years as Portsmouth and Springfield) are currently tied for 
the most league championships with each franchise winning three. On June 
20, 2000, Brian Tollberg debuted with the San Diego Padres, becoming the 
first player from the Frontier League to make it to the Majors. A week 
later Morgan Burkhart made his debut with the Boston Red Sox. Although 
the league does not have any teams located in the same city as Major League 
teams, it does nonetheless have teams located within the markets of Major 
League teams. Chicago (Joliet Slammers, Schaumburg Boomers and Windy City 
ThunderBolts) has 3 teams and St. Louis (Gateway Grizzlies & River City 
Rascals) has 2 teams while Cleveland (Lake Erie Crushers), Cincinnati (Florence 
Freedom) and Pittsburgh (Washington Wild Things) each have one. The Wild 
Things in particular have been able to market themselves as a successful 
alternative to the Pittsburgh Pirates due to the latter franchise's long 
stretch of losing seasons, which lasted from the Frontier League's founding 
in 1993 until 2013 when the Pirates finished with a record of 94-68.[3]
