Willie Lee McCovey (born January 10, 1938), nicknamed "Mac", "Big Mac", 
and "Stretch", is a former Major League Baseball first baseman. He played 
nineteen seasons for the San Francisco Giants, and three more for the San 
Diego Padres and Oakland Athletics, between 1959 and 1980. He batted and 
threw left-handed and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986. 
One of the most intimidating power hitters of his era, McCovey was called 
"the scariest hitter in baseball" by pitcher Bob Gibson, an assessment 
with which Reggie Jackson concurred.[1] McCovey's powerful swing generated 
521 home runs, 231 of which he hit in Candlestick Park, the most hit there 
by any player, and included a home run of September 16, 1966 described 
as the longest ever hit in that stadium.[2] Prior to playing for the San 
Francisco Giants, McCovey played for a Giants' farm club in Dallas, Texas 
that was part of the Class AA Southern League. In that league, he did not 
participate when his team played in Shreveport, Louisiana due to segregation 
in that city. He later played for the Pacific Coast League Phoenix Giants 
just prior to joining the San Francisco Giants.[3] In his Major League 
debut on July 30, 1959, McCovey went four-for-four against Hall-of-Famer 
Robin Roberts of the Philadelphia Phillies, hitting two triples and two 
singles, en route to a .354 batting average that year, in which he won 
the NL Player of the Month award in August, his first full month in the 
majors (.373, 8 HR, 22 RBI). He then took National League Rookie of the 
Year honors while playing in just 52 games. He had a 22-game hitting streak, 
setting the mark for San Francisco Giants rookies that still stands, just 
four short of the all-time team record.[4] Three years later, he helped 
the Giants to the 1962 World Series against the New York Yankees. Perhaps 
McCovey's best-known moment in baseball came in the bottom of the 9th of 
Game 7, with 2 outs and the Giants trailing 1–0. With Willie Mays on second 
base and Matty Alou on third, any base hit would likely have won the championship 
for the Giants. McCovey scorched a hard line drive that was snared by the 
Yankees' second baseman Bobby Richardson, ending the series with a Yankees' 
win. That would turn out to be the closest McCovey would get to playing 
on a world championship team. McCovey spent many years at the heart of 
the Giants' batting order along with fellow Hall-of-Famer Willie Mays. 
His best year statistically was 1969 when he hit 45 home runs, had 126 
RBI and batted .320 to become the National League MVP. He would also win 
NL Player of the Month awards in July 1963 (.310, 13 HR, 27 RBI) and August 
1969 (.315, 8, 22 RBI) In the early years of Candlestick Park, the Giants 
home stadium, the area behind right field was open except for three small 
bleacher sections. When McCovey came to bat, typically those bleachers 
would empty as the fans positioned themselves on the flat ground hoping 
to catch a McCovey home run ball – anticipating the gathering of boats 
in McCovey Cove, a generation later, when Barry Bonds would bat. In 1974, 
McCovey was traded to the San Diego Padres; without him, the Giants' fortunes 
declined. Near the end of the 1976 season, the Oakland Athletics purchased 
his contract, but he would only play eleven games for them. McCovey returned 
to the Giants in 1977. With Hank Aaron and Frank Robinson having retired 
at the end of the 1976 season with 755 and 586 home runs respectively, 
McCovey began 1977 as the active home run leader with 465. That year, during 
a June 27 game against the Cincinnati Reds, he became the first player 
to hit two home runs in one inning twice in his career (the first was on 
April 12, 1973), a feat since accomplished by only Andre Dawson and Jeff 
King. One was a grand slam and he became the first National Leaguer to 
hit seventeen. At age 39, he had 28 home runs and 86 RBI and was named 
the Comeback Player of the Year. On June 30, 1978, at Atlanta's Fulton 
County Stadium, McCovey hit his 500th home run, and two years later, on 
May 3, 1980, at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, McCovey hit his 521st and last 
home run, off Scott Sanderson of the Montreal Expos. This home run gave 
McCovey the distinction, along with Ted Williams (with whom he was tied 
in home runs), Rickey Henderson, and Omar Vizquel of homering in four different 
decades: the 1950s, 60s, 70s, and 80s. McCovey is one of only 29 players 
in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League baseball games 
in four decades. In his 22-year career, McCovey batted .270, with 521 home 
runs and 1,555 RBI, 1,229 runs scored, 2,211 hits, 353 doubles, 46 triples, 
a .374 on-base percentage and a .515 slugging percentage. He also hit 18 
grand slam home runs in his career, which is still a National League record. 
McCovey was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1986. It was his first year 
of eligibility and he appeared on 346 of 425 ballots cast (81.4 percent). 
In 1999, he ranked 56th on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest 
Baseball Players,[5] and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League 
Baseball All-Century Team. Since 1980, the Giants have awarded the Willie 
Mac Award to honor his spirit and leadership. The inlet of San Francisco 
Bay beyond the right field fence of AT&T Park, historically known as China 
Basin, has been redubbed McCovey Cove in his honor. Across McCovey Cove 
from the park a statue of McCovey was erected and the land on which it 
stands named McCovey Point. The Giants retired his uniform number 44 on 
September 21, 1980, which he wore in honor of Hank Aaron, a fellow Mobile, 
Alabama native.[6][7] McCovey was inducted to the Afro Sports Hall of Fame, 
February 7, 2009 in Oakland, California. McCovey is a senior advisor with 
the Giants. The Willlie McCovey field at Woodside Elementary School was 
recently rededicated in 2013 [3] In 1996, McCovey was fined and given two 
years' probation for tax charges stemming from inadequate reporting of 
income earned from 1988 to 1990.[8] In September 2003, McCovey and a business 
partner opened McCovey's Restaurant, a baseball-themed sports bar and restaurant,
