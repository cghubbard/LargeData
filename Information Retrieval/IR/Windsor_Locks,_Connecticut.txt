Windsor Locks is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. 
As of the 2010 census, its population was 12,498.[1] It is the site of 
Bradley International Airport, which serves the Greater Hartford-Springfield 
region and occupies approximately 1/3 of the town. Windsor Locks is also 
the site of the New England Air Museum. Located beside the Connecticut 
River and equidistant from the densely populated cities of Springfield, 
Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut, Windsor Locks is named for a set 
of canal locks that opened in 1829. Windsor Locks is situated just south 
of the first large falls in the Connecticut River, the Enfield Falls, which 
is the northernmost point that seagoing vessels can reach on the Connecticut 
River before transferring to smaller ships. The Enfield Falls Canal circumvents 
the Enfield Falls and its nearby shallows.[2] Originally part of Windsor, 
Windsor Locks broke off into its own settlement in 1854 after the thriving 
Enfield Locks going around Enfield Falls which opened in 1829. The Bradley 
International Airport opened in 1940 and to civilian use in 1947. In 1967 
the town boundary was somewhat altered due to the opening of the Bradley 
Connector. The town boundary between Windsor Locks and Windsor changed 
several times and was altered with Windsor Locks being on the westbound 
side and the Windsor side on the eastbound side with the border on the 
median. The 1965 Little League World Series winning team is from Windsor

2000, Windsor Locks was home to the oldest corporation listed on the New 
York Stock Exchange, the Dexter Corporation. Established in 1767 as C.H. 
Dexter and Sons, the company grew from a family-owned saw and grist mill 
and evolved into a multi-national producer of long fiber papers and chemical 
laminates. In its 233 years of operation, the company grew from manufacturing 
tissues, toilet paper, and tea bags to marketing more specialized products 
like medical garments and industrial finishes. Faced with a proposed buyout 
by International Specialty Products Incorporated in 2000, the Dexter Corporation 
separated its three divisions and sold them off to avoid a hostile takeover. 
The Life Sciences division merged with Invitrogen Corporation. The Specialty 
Polymers division was sold in part to Akzo Nobel, and the remaining businesses 
merged with Loctite Corporation. The third division, Dexter Nonwoven Materials, 
located on the company's original site in Windsor Locks, was sold to the 
Finnish Ahlstrom Paper Group. The physical plant continues to operate, 
with offices located nearby at 2 Elm Street. In 2011, the Home and Personal 
Nonwovens division of Ahlstrom Windsor Locks was sold to Suominen Corporation, 
also headquartered in Finland. In 1952 Hamilton Standard opened its aircraft 
propeller plant in Windsor Locks. In 1999, Hamilton Standard merged with 
Sundstrand Corporation to become Hamilton Sundstrand, which is headquartered 
in Windsor Locks. Hamilton Sundstrand is now UTC Aerospace. On 19 September 
2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston ceased operations at Windsor Locks
