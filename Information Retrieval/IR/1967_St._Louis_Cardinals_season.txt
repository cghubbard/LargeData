The 1967 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 86th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri, its 76th season in the National League, and its first full season 
at Busch Memorial Stadium. Gussie Busch hired former outfielder Stan Musial 
as general manager before the season. Featuring four future Hall of Famers 
in Lou Brock, Bob Gibson, Steve Carlton and Orlando Cepeda, "El Birdos" 
went 101–60 during the season and won the NL pennant by 10½ games over 
the San Francisco Giants. They went on to win the 1967 World Series in 
seven games over the Boston Red Sox. First baseman Orlando Cepeda won the 
MVP Award this year, batting .325, with 25 home runs and 111 RBIs. He was 
the first unanimous selection for the award in the history of the National 
League.[3] Pitcher Bob Gibson and outfielder Curt Flood won Gold Gloves 
this year. Flood, whose record streak of 568 consecutive chances in the 
field without an error ended June 4 when he dropped a fly ball, returned 
to regular play in late July. His 227-game string had begun September 3, 
1965. Once back in the lineup, he batted .373 the rest of the season, finishing 
fourth in the league at .335. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: Pos

World Series, bursting "The Impossible Dream" bubble of the latter team, 
which had won their first pennant in 21 years on the last day of the season. 
Bob Gibson won Games 1, 4 and 7 in the Series and was named Series MVP 
for a second time. Nelson Briles won Game 3. Gibson came back from a broken 
leg during the season to accomplish his incredible World Series performance. 
KMOX radio awarded Lou Brock a car for his superb play (12–29 .414 with 
a record-tying 7 stolen bases) in the Series. NL St. Louis Cardinals (4) 
vs. AL Boston Red Sox (3) Despite winning a World Series in his first season 
as general manager, Musial stepped down, citing that he did not think the 
occupation was right for him, making it his only season as GM. He worked 
in other capacities in the Cardinals front office until 1980. Busch rehired 
Bing Devine after Musial's resignation. LEAGUE CHAMPIONS: St. Petersburg[6]
