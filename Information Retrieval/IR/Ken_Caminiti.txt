Kenneth Gene Caminiti (April 21, 1963 – October 10, 2004) was an American 
third baseman who spent fifteen seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
with the Houston Astros (1987–1994, 1999–2000), San Diego Padres (1995–1998), 
Texas Rangers (2001) and Atlanta Braves (2001). He was named the National 
League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) with San Diego in 1996, and is a 
member of the Padres Hall of Fame. He died of a cocaine and heroin (a speedball) 
drug overdose on October 10, 2004. Caminiti was born in Hanford, California 
on April 21, 1963 to Yvonne and Lee Caminiti who had another son, Glenn 
and a daughter, Carrie. He starred in football and baseball at Leigh High 
School where he graduated in 1981.[1] In football, he was invited to many 
all-star games after his senior football season. He attended San Jose State 
University where he played for the Spartans in 1983 and 1984. Caminiti 
was signed as a 3rd round pick in the 1984 amateur draft by the Houston 
Astros. Caminiti played professional baseball for 15 seasons, beginning 
with the Osceola Astros of the Single-A Florida State League in 1985. He 
also played third base for the Indios de Mayagüez along with Wally Joyner 
in the Puerto Rico Winter League. He earned a call-up to the Double-A Columbus 
Astros in 1987. He made his major league debut at age 24 with the Houston 
Astros on July 16, 1987. In 1988, Caminiti returned to the minor leagues, 
playing with the Triple-A Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League, before 
he was called up to stay late in the season. Caminiti was plagued with 
several injuries throughout his tenure in Houston, but he still hit 18 
home runs in 1994 which earned him his first All Star Game selection. After 
6 full seasons in Houston, Caminiti was traded to the San Diego Padres 
after the 1994 season in a 12-player trade, along with Steve Finley, Andújar 
Cedeño, Roberto Petagine, Brian Williams, and a player to be named later 
(PTBNL), in exchange for Derek Bell, Doug Brocail, Ricky Gutiérrez, Pedro 
Martínez, Phil Plantier, and Craig Shipley. In San Diego he reached career 
highs at the plate by hitting .302 with 26 home runs and 94 RBI in 1995, 
which rose to .326/40/130 in 1996. Despite playing most of 1996 with a 
torn right rotator cuff, his performance earned him the National League 
Most Valuable Player Award.[2] In 1998, Caminiti led the Padres to the 
1998 World Series where they lost to the New York Yankees 4-0. Caminiti 
returned to Houston as a free agent in 1999 after signing a 9.5 million 
dollar contract, where he played for two more seasons. He was slowed by 
injuries during his second tenure in Houston, and after struggling the 
first half of 2001 with the Texas Rangers where he hit just .232, he was 
released and finished his career with the Atlanta Braves, who moved him 
across the infield in an effort to fulfill their desire for a power-hitting 
first baseman. Caminiti won 3 Gold Glove Awards while playing for the Padres[3] 
in 1995, 1996, and 1997, and he was unanimously selected as the National 
League's MVP in 1996. In 1994, 1996, and 1997, he appeared in the All Star 
Game. Caminiti is the Padres All-Time leader in slugging percentage (.540) 
and OPS (.924). In 2016, he was posthumously elected into the San Diego 
Padres Hall of Fame.[4] Following his playing career in baseball, Caminiti 
was hired by the Padres to be a spring training instructor for his former 
team. Caminiti entered into a partnership with actor Jason Gedrick and 
hockey player Mario Lemieux to open a cigar bar called Ashes Cigar Club 
on Wall Street.[5][unreliable source?] Caminiti was married to Nancy Smith 
from November 14, 1987 to December 10, 2002. Caminiti and his wife, Nancy, 
had 3 daughters, Kendall, Lindsey, and Nicole.[6] Caminiti struggled with 
substance abuse throughout his career. He admitted in 1994 to having a 
problem with alcoholism and checked himself into a rehabilitation center 
in 2000. In a Sports Illustrated cover story in 2002, a year after his 
retirement, he admitted that he had used steroids during his 1996 MVP season, 
and for several seasons afterwards.[7] His admitted steroid abuse was discussed 
in the 2007 Mitchell Report on steroid abuse in baseball.[8] Caminiti also 
had a long struggle with cocaine, having been arrested in March 2001 for 
possession and sentenced to probation. In February, 2003, Caminiti tested 
positive for cocaine while already on probation for cocaine possession 
and was ordered to visit a Texas Department of Criminal Justice-operated 
treatment program. The Program was eliminated in May of that year and Caminiti 
was forced to leave after completing most of the program.[9] On October 
5, 2004 — just five days prior to his death — he admitted in a Houston 
court that he had violated his probation. He tested positive for cocaine 
in September 2004. It was his fourth such violation and he was sentenced 
to 180 days in prison but given credit for time already served and released. 
In the early afternoon of October 10, 2004, Caminiti was in the apartment 
of his friend in The Bronx, New York City, after being in the bathroom 
to have a speedball of cocaine and heroin, Caminiti came out and collapsed 
on the floor.[10] At 3:36 pm a 911 call was made while Caminiti was going 
into cardiac arrest. Caminiti died at Lincoln Hospital in The Bronx at 
6:45 pm. Preliminary news reports indicated he died of a heart attack,[11] 
but the autopsy results stated that "acute intoxication due to the combined 
effects of cocaine and opiates" caused his death, with coronary artery 
disease and cardiac hypertrophy (an enlarged heart) as contributing factors.[12] 
Media coverage of Caminiti's death was almost completely overshadowed by 
that of actor Christopher Reeve, who also died in New York City the same 
day as Caminiti. After final funeral services held in Solana Beach, California 
(a San Diego suburb), which was attended by many Padres players, past and 
present, Caminiti's remains were cremated and were interred at the Cambo 
Ranch in Sabinal, Texas, which Caminiti co-owned along with former teammate 
Craig Biggio.[13] Caminiti died only 10 years after another former Padres'
