Milton Edward Wilcox (born April 20, 1950) is a retired MLB pitcher who 
had a sixteen-year career from 1970 to 1975, 1977â€“1986. He played for the 
Cincinnati Reds and Chicago Cubs of the National League and the Cleveland 
Indians, Detroit Tigers and Seattle Mariners of the American League. He 
won a World Series title with the Tigers in 1984. On April 15, 1983, Wilcox 
came within one out of a perfect game, when Chicago White Sox batter Jerry 
Hairston, Sr. singled off him in the ninth inning.[1] The perfect game 
would also have been the first no-hitter by a Tiger since Jim Bunning in 
1958. With Detroit, he was a reliable starter in the rotation for years, 
consistently giving his team six and more innings each start. This complemented 
Jack Morris and Dan Petry, who were power pitchers and considered the aces. 
His 17 wins in 1984 were important in the Tigers' run to their world championship. 
(Morris won 19, Petry 18 that year.) He won one game each in that year's 
ALCS and World Series. That year, he also started his season going 6-0. 
This was not duplicated by a Tiger pitcher until 2007, by Jeremy Bonderman.
