William Edward "Eddie" Robinson (born December 15, 1920) is an American 
Major League Baseball first baseman, scout, coach and front office executive 
of the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s who, during a 13-year playing 
career (1942; 1946–57), was on the roster of seven of the eight American 
League teams then in existence. He is the author of an autobiography, published 
in 2011, titled Lucky Me: My Sixty-five Years in Baseball.[1] Robinson 
is the last living person to win the World Series with the Cleveland Indians,[2] 
as well as the oldest living player to play on a World Series-winning team 
and the oldest living member of the Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, and 
Washington Senators.[3] Born in the Northeastern Texas town of Paris, Eddie 
Robinson, a left-handed batter who threw right-handed, enjoyed his most 
prominent team moment when, at the age of 27, he contributed to his first 
team, the Cleveland Indians, winning the 1948 World Series. Although traded 
during that offseason, he was still at the top of his game and, at the 
next two teams, Washington Senators (1949–50) and Chicago White Sox (1950–52), 
experienced the most productive seasons of his time in the majors. Overall, 
he appeared in 1,315 games and batted .268 with 172 home runs. He did not 
play in the 1943 through 1945 seasons, due to his service in the US Navy 
during World War II.[4] A four-time All-Star, he was the American League's 
starting first baseman for the midsummer classics of 1949 and 1952. The 
first game was a slugfest, 11-7, won by the American League, with a Robinson 
first-inning single off National League starter Warren Spahn driving in 
Joe DiMaggio. In the 1952 game, a rain-shortened 3-2 National League victory, 
Robinson singled in the American League's first run, scoring Minnie Miñoso, 
who had led off the fourth inning with a double. Upon retirement, he became 
a coach for the Baltimore Orioles and then moved into their player development 
department. A protégé of Orioles manager Paul Richards, he followed Richards 
to the Houston Astros, then worked as the farm system director of the Kansas 
City Athletics during the tempestuous ownership of Charlie Finley in the 
mid-1960s. In 1968 he rejoined Richards in the front office of the Atlanta 
Braves. He succeeded Richards as general manager of the Braves during the 
1972 season, serving through early 1976 in that post. Robinson then returned 
to the American League as a member of the Texas Rangers front office. In 
1977, Robinson was named co-general manager (with Dan O'Brien) of the Rangers, 
and became sole GM from 1978–82. Although the Rangers posted winning seasons 
in 1977, 1978 and 1981, a disastrous 1982 campaign cost Robinson his General 
Manager job.[5] Continuing in baseball as a scout and player development 
consultant, he found his last position as a scout for the Boston Red Sox, 
the only team of the "original eight" American League clubs that he did
