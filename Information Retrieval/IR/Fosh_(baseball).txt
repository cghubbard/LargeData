The fosh, fosh ball, or fosh change is a seldom used pitch in Major League 
Baseball described as "a cross between a split-fingered pitch and a straight 
change-up".[1] It is designed to fool a batter expecting a fastball to

Other pitchers who have used it in a game are Jason Frasor,[2] Trevor Hoffman,[2] 
Johan Santana,[2] and Carl Pavano,[5] and Carlos Rosa.[6] There are various 
etymologies for the term "fosh". According to The Neyer/James Guide to

by David Nied, who said the term sounds "like the perfect word for the 
movement of the pitch".[3] A third derivation, from Al Nipper, is that
