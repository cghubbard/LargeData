Matthew James Adams (born August 31, 1988) is an American professional 
baseball first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Nicknamed Big City for his imposing size and ability to regularly 
hit long home runs, the Cardinals drafted Adams in the 23rd round of the 
2009 MLB draft from Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania. Playing in 
the Texas League in 2011, Adams was recognized as that league's Most Valuable 
Player and the Cardinals Minor League Player of the Year with a .300 batting 
average, 32 home runs and 101 runs batted in. He made his MLB debut in 
2012. In his rookie season in 2013, Adams hit 17 home runs in 296 at-bats. 
Matt Adams grew up in Philipsburg, Centre County, Pennsylvania. According 
to an interview with Fox Sports Midwest he was a big fan of Ken Griffey, 
Jr. After graduating from Philipsburg-Osceola High School he attended Slippery 
Rock University[1] where he holds the career records of batting average 
(.473) and slugging percentage (.754). In 2009, he was named the National 
Collegiate Baseball Writers Association's Division II National Player of 
the Year.[2][3] The St. Louis Cardinals drafted Matt Adams in the 23rd 
round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft.[4] At each level he played 
in the minor leagues, Adams displayed prodigious hitting ability. His first 
full-season assignment came in 2010 with the Quad Cities River Bandits 
of the Class A Midwest League. In 121 games, he batted .310 with 71 runs 
scored, 44 doubles, 22 home runs (HR), and 88 runs batted in (RBI). His 
.541 slugging percentage (SLG) led all Cardinals minor leaguers. In 2011, 
Adams was named the Cardinals Minor League Player of the Year and the Texas 
League Most Valuable Player (MVP) after hitting .300, a .357 on-base percentage 
(OBP) and .566 SLG with 32 HR and 101 RBI in 115 games. He set club records 
in home runs and RBI, including eclipsing the mark of 29 HR Colby Rasmus 
set in 2007.[3][5] After the season, Adams played in the Arizona Fall League 
(AFL), and he was selected to represent the Cardinals in the AFL Rising 
Stars Game.[6] Prior to the 2012 season, Baseball America considered him 
the ninth best prospect in the Cardinals organization.[7] On May 20, 2012, 
the Cardinals called Adams up after placing Lance Berkman on the disabled 
list (DL). He went 2-for-4 in his major league debut.[8][9] He hit his 
first major league home run six days later. Adams played in 27 games with 
the Cardinals where he hit .244 with 13 RBI and two home runs before returning 
to Memphis.[10] Splitting time between the Memphis Redbirds of the Class 
AAA Pacific Coast League and the Cardinals, he continued to show consistent 
power and batting average in the minor leagues. At Memphis, Adams hit 18 
home runs with 50 RBI as he batted .329 with a .624 slugging percentage.[10] 
However, an elbow injury brought an early end to his 2012 season. The injury, 
which had been a nagging problem much of summer, finally had to be treated 
surgically in mid-August to remove a bone spur.[11] Adams led the Cardinals 
in 2013 spring training with 17 RBI.[2] It was at that point that Adams 
earned his nickname, "Big City." According to former teammate David Freese, 
several players had been searching for a nickname for the 6 ft 3 inch 230-pounder, 
when one day someone shouted out "Big City." Said Freese: "Well he's a 
big boy that can rake [the ball]. I guess it hit because the guy can flat-out 
hit."[12] Adams started off the regular season on the St. Louis Cardinals 
roster as a bench player, backing up first baseman Allen Craig. He caught 
the attention of the fans and media early on when in his first ten plate 
appearances he hit three home runs, two doubles, three singles, and a walk.[13] 
For a significant part of April, his batting average hovered between .640 
and .700.[2] With a right oblique strain, the Cardinals placed on the 15-day 
disabled list on April 26, retroactive to April 22.[14] As the season progressed, 
teams began to notice his pull-hitting tendencies and often employed an 
extreme infield shift on him that left one or no fielders on the left side 
of the second base bag. He also had difficulty hitting off-speed pitches 
from left-handed pitchers. Because he often grounded out to the right side 
of the bag, his batting average began to precipitously decline. In June, 
he batted just .179 and .205 in August.[15] At the conclusion of his rookie 
season, Adams finished with a .284 batting average and .503 SLG. He connected 
for 17 HR in 296 AB for a ratio of one home run every 17.41 at bats. That 
represented the third-best figure for rookies in franchise history. His 
home run to fly ball ratio was 21.8%, ranking 11th in the major leagues 
for all players with at least 300 PA.[16] Regular right fielder Carlos 
Beltrán became a free agent after the season. Craig shifted to right field 
to replace him, clearing a way for Adams to assume first base regularly.[17] 
During a game against the Cincinnati Reds on April 3, 2014 in Cincinnati, 
Adams was attempting to catch a Chris Heisey pop-up that sailed into the 
shallow part of the seats. The infield tarp was in Adams' run path. As 
he leaned over the tarp to catch the ball, it was falling toward the second 
row of seats, and a fan named Chris Smith caught the ball with his own 
glove just above Adams' outstretch glove. Adams shifted his momentum to 
stand back up behind the tarp, and planted his glove on Smith's chest, 
pushing himself backward with a moderate shove. Smith, who had been recovering 
from knee surgery, gestured an obscenity with his hand toward him. During 
post-game interviews, Adams stated that he did not realize he had shoved 
Smith, but that he was preventing himself from falling into the stands.[18] 
Opponents escalated the rate of infield shifting the employed against Adams 
in 2014, as it was already a league-wide trend. To foil the shift, he began 
to hit the ball more to left field (also a technique known as "taking the 
pitch the other way") from the outset of the season.[15] Another difference 
from the season prior was that he did not hit his first home run until 
the eleventh game of 2014, which took place against the Chicago Cubs. The 
results of his modified approach began to show, as he was batting .357 
with a .400 OBP and .548 SLG through that game.[19] Despite the drop-off 
in the power numbers, he continued to hit well against the shift. As of 
June 10, he was batting .390 (16 for 41) on ground balls and line drives 
against the shift with three home runs for the year. He also did it without 
successfully bunting for a base hit.[20] The team placed Adams on the DL 
for the second time in his MLB career from May–June. After his return, 
he homered in the first three games.[21] His first multi-homer game of 
the season came against the Colorado Rockies on June 23 at Coors Field 
with two home runs and six RBI in an 8–0 victory.[22] This was Adams' third 
MLB multi-home run game and first the six-RBI game for the Cardinals since 
David Freese did it June 7, 2012 against the Houston Astros.[23] In a July 
7 contest against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Adams hit the first walk-off 
home run in the regular season by a Cardinals batter since Skip Schumaker 
did so against the Kansas City Royals in 2011.[24] In Game 4 of the 2014 
NLDS, Adams erased the Los Angeles Dodgers' 2–0 lead in the 7th inning 
with a three-run homer off ace Clayton Kershaw. The home run accounted 
for the winning runs in the Cardinals' 3–2 victory, helping to secure their 
fourth straight NLCS appearance.[25] On May 27, 2015, the Cardinals placed 
Adams on the DL with a torn quadriceps muscle, and he was initially supposed 
to miss the remainder of the season.[26] The Cardinals reactivated him 
on September 9.[27] As an arbitration-eligible player prior to the 2016 
season, Adams and the Cardinals agreed to a one-year, $1.65 million contract.[28] 
He continued his success in foiling the shift through May 2016 by a slight 
modification to his swing, and as a result, successfully gaining hits to 
each of the three outfield zones over 30 percent of the time. He had hit 
.354, three home runs, 14 RBI and .604 SLG through the first 25 days of 
that month.[29] On July 22, 2016, while playing the Dodgers, Adams hit 
a 444 feet (135 m) home run in the 16th inning for walk-off, 4−3, win. 
It was the second time in his career he had hit a walk-off home run in
