James Anthony Shields (born December 20, 1981) is an American professional 
baseball starting pitcher for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He has pitched in MLB for the Tampa Bay Rays from 2006 through 2012, 
the Kansas City Royals in 2013 and 2014, and the San Diego Padres in 2015 
and 2016. Shields grew up in Newhall, California.[1] He has two older brothers.[2] 
While attending William S. Hart High School, he was named the Los Angeles 
Times's Valley Player of the Year in 1999,[3] his junior season after leading 
Hart to the Division II championship. He had a 11–0 win–loss record with 
a 2.35 earned run average (ERA) with 123 strikeouts in 71 1⁄3 innings pitched. 
He also batted .478 with a then-school record 11 home runs and 45 runs 
batted in, being named the Southern Section's Division II Player of the 
Year. He declined a full scholarship to play baseball at Louisiana State 
University in favor of signing with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.[4] Baseball 
America ranked him the 16th best high school prospect in 2000.[5] Shields 
was drafted in 16th round of the 2000 amateur baseball draft by the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays.[6] After pitching well during his first season at the Class-A 
level in 2001, Shields underwent serious shoulder surgery that caused him 
to miss the entire 2002 season. His fastball lost some velocity as a result, 
forcing him to change his pitching approach and develop a changeup as he 
worked his way up through the Devil Rays system.[7] Shields made his Major 
League debut against the Baltimore Orioles on May 31, 2006.[6] He surrendered 
five runs over five innings as he earned a no-decision. On June 5, Shields 
picked up his first big league win against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, 
striking out six over six innings of work. On June 21, 2006, Shields became 
the first Devil Rays pitcher to start his career with 4 straight wins. 
Shields' rookie season with Tampa Bay was relatively unimpressive. He finished 
with a 6–8 record and an ERA of 4.84.[8] However, his 104 strikeouts in 
just under 125 innings was promising. In 2007, Shields began to emerge 
as a legitimate top of the rotation starter to complement Scott Kazmir. 
On May 9, he pitched nine shutout, 3-hit innings, only to receive a no 
decision due to lack of run support in an eventual 10-inning loss. Later, 
on May 30, he pitched a complete game in a 5–3 win vs the Detroit Tigers 
in which after a 3-run first inning, he retired 13 straight batters. Shields 
finished the season 12–8 with a 3.85 ERA in 31 starts. His 184 strikeouts 
in 215 innings placed him among the league leaders. He was also second-best 
in the AL in strikeout-to-walk ratio (5.11 K/BB) and third-best in walks 
per 9 innings (1.51 BB/9) and WHIP (1.107). Based on less than two full 
years of major league work with Tampa Bay, the Rays signed him to a 4-year, 
11.25 million dollar contract after the 2008 season. This deal contains 
3 team options and multiple performance bonuses, that could expand the 
deal to 7-years and upwards of $44 million.[9] After an injury to Tampa 
Bay's ace, Scott Kazmir, Shields made the 2008 Opening Day start for the 
Rays against Baltimore, earning the win by giving up two runs in seven 
innings in the 6–2 victory. On April 27, 2008, Shields threw a two-hit 
complete game shutout against the Boston Red Sox, throwing only 98 pitches 
for his first of his career. On May 9, 2008 (exactly one year after his 
gem against Detroit) Shields had a one-hit shutout against the Angels, 
posting a Game Score of 93. On June 5, 2008, during a game against the 
Boston Red Sox, Shields hit Coco Crisp with a pitch and Crisp charged the 
mound. Shields threw a punch and missed, while Crisp countered with a punch 
at Shields that also missed. Moments later, both teams' benches emptied 
onto the field. Shields stated afterward that he was protecting his teammates, 
believing he did the right thing following an incident the night before 
involving Crisp.[10] Following the incident, Shields and Crisp were both 
suspended, being banned for 6 and 7 games, respectively.[11] Shields threw 
a changeup 26.3% of the time in 2008, tops in the AL.[12] Shields is the 
first and only Tampa Bay Rays pitcher to win a World Series game (2008). 
The Rays ended up losing the 2008 World Series to the Philadelphia Phillies 
within 5 games. Shields led the Rays in innings pitched in 2008 with 215, 
and also tied Edwin Jackson to lead the Rays with 14 wins, which also tied 
the record for most wins by a Rays pitcher.[13] In 2009, Shields was the 
Opening Day starter for the Rays. The Rays fell, 5–3, to the Red Sox, in 
an ALCS rematch. On August 3, James had a no-hitter going into the 8th 
inning against the Kansas City Royals. It was broken up by Royals catcher 
John Buck. On August 7, 2010, Shields gave up 6 home runs to the Toronto 
Blue Jays (2 by Aaron Hill, and 1 by Edwin Encarnacion, Adam Lind, Jose 
Bautista, and J.P. Arencibia), tying a modern-day record of home runs allowed 
in one game.[14] Arencibia's home run was the first of his career, hit 
in his first at-bat off Shields' first pitch. Shields was selected as an 
All-Star for the first time in his Major League career in 2011.[15] He 
was named the 2011 Tampa Bay Rays team MVP by the Tampa Bay chapter of 
the Baseball Writers Association of America, compiling a 16–12 win–loss 
record, 2.82 ERA, a career-high 225 strikeouts, and a team-record 11 complete 
games.[16] The 11 complete games earned him the nickname "Complete Game 
James" among fans and local media.[17] Shields also finished 3rd in the 
American League Cy Young voting.[18] Despite continued success on the mound 
in 2012, Shields did not receive much run support from the Rays and finished 
the season with a record of 15-10 and a 3.52 ERA. During his final start 
of the season on October 2, he pitched a complete game against the Baltimore 
Orioles, setting a franchise record with 15 strikeouts. Despite only giving 
up two hits, Shields took the loss as the Orioles won the game 1-0, with 
the deciding run coming off a home run by Chris Davis. On December 9, 2012, 
Shields was traded to the Kansas City Royals (along with Wade Davis) in 
exchange for Wil Myers, Jake Odorizzi, Mike Montgomery and Patrick Leonard.[19] 
In his first year as a Royal, Shields posted a 13-9 record with a 3.15 
ERA, also setting a personal best in games started. On October 31, 2013, 
the Kansas City Royals exercised a $13.5 million option on Shields for 
the 2014 season. On May 13, 2014, in a 5-1 victory over the Colorado Rockies, 
Shields struck out Troy Tulowitzki in the sixth inning to record his 1,500th 
career strikeout. Shields started the first postseason game for the Royals 
in 29 years on September 30. He allowed 4 earned runs over 5 innings as 
the Royals defeated the Oakland Athletics in 12 innings, 9-8. On October 
5, 2014, Shields started Game 3 of the American League Divisional Series 
against the Los Angeles Angels. He pitched 6 innings, allowed 2 earned 
runs on 6 hits and struck out 6 and earned the win as the Royals swept 
the Angels. After then sweeping the Orioles, he led Kansas City to their 
first World Series in 29 years.[20] In the 2014 World Series, Shields started 
in games 1 and 5, but lost both, and the Royals lost the series 4 games 
to 3. Following the 2014 season, Shields became a free agent. On February 
11, 2015, the San Diego Padres signed Shields to a four-year contract, 
worth $75 million, with a fifth-year club option.[21] In 33 starts for 
the Padres in 2015, Shields went 13-7 with a 3.91 ERA and 216 strikeouts. 
However, Shields also gave up a league leading 33 home runs.[22] On June 
4, 2016, Shields was traded to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for Erik 
Johnson and Fernando Tatis Jr.[23] Shields made his first start with the 
White Sox against the Washington Nationals on June 8, 2016. He allowed 
7 earned runs in 2 1⁄3 innings pitched before being taken out of the game. 
The White Sox would lose the game, 11 to 4.[24] Shields went 4-12 with 
a 6.77 ERA in the 114.1 innings pitched for the White Sox.He also had a 
1.70 Walks and Hits Per Inning Pitched record and gave up 31 Home Runs 
with Chicago. Shields has great command of his fastball and changeup. His 
four-seamer and two-seamer each are typically thrown 91-94 MPH. His changeup 
is top notch when he keeps it down in the zone and sits in the mid 80s. 
Shields also throws a cut fastball that has superb movement and is thrown 
in the high 80s. He also occasionally mixes in an average curve.[25][26]
