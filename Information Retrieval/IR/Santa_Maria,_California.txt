Santa Barbara Santa Maria is a city near the Southern California coast 
in Santa Barbara County. It is approximately 120 miles (190 km) northwest 
of Los Angeles (city limits). Its estimated 2014 population was 103,410,[9] 
making it the most populous city in the county and the Santa Maria-Santa 
Barbara, CA Metro Area. The city is notable for its wine industry and Santa 
Maria-style barbecue. Sunset magazine called Santa Maria "The West's Best 
BBQ Town".[11] The Santa Maria Valley, stretching from the Santa Lucia 
Mountains toward the Pacific Ocean, was the homeland of the Chumash people 
for several thousand years. The Native Americans made their homes on the 
slopes of the surrounding hills among the oaks, on the banks of the Santa 
Maria River among the sycamores, and along the coast. They had unique plank-built 
boats, called Tomol, which they used for ocean fishing. In 1769, the Portolá 
Expedition passed through the Santa Maria Valley during the first Spanish 
land exploration up the coast of Las Californias Province. Mission San 
Luis Obispo de Tolosa was established just north of the valley in 1772, 
and Mission La Purísima Concepción was established near present-day Lompoc 
in 1787. Rather than rich soil, white settlers were attracted here by the 
possibility of free land. In 1821, after the Mexican War of Independence, 
the mission lands in Santa Maria Valley were made available for private 
ownership under a Mexican land grant called Rancho Punta de Laguna. At 
the end of the Mexican War in 1848, California was ceded to the United 
States. In the late 19th century, after California gained statehood in 
1850, the area's rich soil attracted farmers and other settlers. By the 
end of the century, the Santa Maria River Valley had become one of the 
most productive agricultural areas in the state. Agriculture is still a 
key component of the economy for the city and the entire region.[12] Between 
1869 and 1874, four of the valley's settlers, Rudolph Cook, John Thornburg, 
Isaac Fesler (for whom Fesler Jr. High School is named), and Isaac Miller 
(for whom Miller Elementary School is named), built their homes near each 
other at the present corners on Broadway and Main Street. The townsite 
was recorded in Santa Barbara in 1875. The new town was named Grangerville, 
then changed to Central City. It became Santa Maria on February 18, 1885, 
since mail was often being sent by mistake to Central City, Colorado. Santa 
Maria was chosen from the name Juan Pacifico Ontiveros had given to his 
property 25 years earlier.[citation needed] Streets named after the four 
settlers now form a 6 block square centered at Broadway and Main Street, 
the center of town. Oil exploration began in 1888, leading to large-scale 
discoveries at the turn of the 20th century. In 1902, Union Oil discovered 
the large Orcutt Oil Field in the Solomon Hills south of town, and a number 
of smaller companies also began pumping oil. Two years later, Union Oil 
had 22 wells in production. Other significant discoveries followed, including 
the Lompoc Oil Field in 1903 and the Cat Canyon field in 1908. Over the 
next 80 years more large oil fields were found, and thousands of oil wells 
drilled and put into production. Oil development intensified in 1930s, 
with the discovery of the Santa Maria Valley Oil Field in 1934,[13] right 
underneath the southern and western parts of the city of Santa Maria, which 
spurred the city's growth even further. By 1957 there were 1,775 oil wells 
in operation in the Santa Maria Valley, producing more than $640 million 
worth of oil. Santa Maria is located at 34°57′5″N 120°26′0″W﻿ / ﻿34.95139°N 
120.43333°W﻿ / 34.95139; -120.43333 (34.951377, -120.433373).[14] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 22.4 square 
miles (58 km2), of which, 22.8 square miles (59 km2) of it is land and 
0.6 square miles (1.6 km2) of it (2.73%) is water. Santa Maria is situated 
north of the unincorporated township of Orcutt, California, and south of 
the Santa Maria River (which serves as the line between Santa Barbara County 
and San Luis Obispo County). The valley is bordered on the west by the 
Pacific Ocean and to the east by the San Rafael Mountains and the Los Padres 
National Forest. The city of Guadalupe, California is approximately 9 miles 
(14 km) to the west of Santa Maria. Santa Maria experiences a cool Mediterranean 
climate (Köppen climate classification Csb) typical of coastal areas of 
California north of Point Conception. The climate is mostly sunny, refreshed 
by the ocean breeze. Fog is common. Snow in the lowest parts of the city 
is virtually unknown, with the last brief flurry recorded in January 1949. 
The only recorded earlier snowfall was in January 1882. Rainfall averages 
14 inches (360 mm) annually. Agriculture plays an important role in the 
city's economy. The Santa Maria area is home to an increasing number of 
vineyards, wineries and winemakers and is centrally located to both the 
Santa Ynez and Foxen Canyon areas of Santa Barbara County's wine country, 
and San Luis Obispo County's Edna Valley-Arroyo Grande wine country. The 
agricultural areas surrounding the city are some of the most productive 
in California, with primary crops including strawberries, wine grapes, 
celery, lettuce, peas, squash, cauliflower, spinach, broccoli and beans. 
Many cattle ranchers also call the Santa Maria Valley home. In recent years, 
other industries have been being added to the city's agricultural and retail 
mix, including: aerospace; communications; high-tech research and development; 
energy production; military operations; and manufacturing. The petroleum 
industry has had a large presence in the area since oil was first discovered 
at the Orcutt Oil Field in 1902. By 1957 there were 1,775 oil wells in 
operation in the Santa Maria Valley, producing more than $640 million worth 
of oil.[12] According to the City's 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial 
Report,[18] and updated City of Santa Maria employee figures reported in 
the 2014-2016 City Budget,[19] the top employers in the city are: The 2010

Superior Court locations in Santa Barbara County, with the other courthouse 
located in Santa Barbara. From 2003-2005, the Superior Court handled a 
felony complaint against Michael Jackson (see Michael Jackson: 2005 trial) 
which reached a not guilty verdict on June 13, 2005. The District Attorney 
chose to present the trial in Santa Maria due to its close proximity from 
Neverland Ranch where the alleged incident took place. Santa Maria is split 
down the middle of the political spectrum, in contrast to Santa Barbara, 
which tends to be more liberal. Due in part to this political division, 
plus irrigation and water-supply issues, many attempts have been made to 
divide the county, the northern portion from Point Conception upwards to 
become Mission County. Thus far the movement has been unsuccessful.[citation 
needed] As the primary law enforcement agency for the City of Santa Maria, 
the Santa Maria Police Department handles approximately 130,000 calls for 
service each year. The Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office also operates 
within the city in addition to the Santa Maria Park Officers who consist 
of 6 sworn officers who derive their authority under CA Penal code section 
831.31(b). The SMPD is administratively divided into the three divisions, 
Administration, Operations, and Support, and has 111 sworn officers and 
49 full-time support personnel.[24] U.S. Route 101 runs through the middle 
of the Santa Maria Valley and is the main freeway connecting many west 
coast cities. It has been improved to freeway status (meaning all at-grade 
intersections have been eliminated) within the city of Santa Maria itself. 
There was recently a widening project that expanded the freeway from four 
to six lanes between Santa Maria Way and the Route 135 overcrossing. The 
$32 million project was completed in late 2008 / early 2009. State Route 
1 runs around the western edge of the city and connects it to nearby Vandenberg 
Air Force Base near Lompoc. The section of 101 in the city is a freeway, 
and a small part of a nearby section of Highway 1 that runs between the 
city and the base is also a freeway, but the two freeway segments do not 
directly connect to each other. State Route 135 is considered to be the 
major artery through the city. It comes from Los Alamos, a town to the 
south of Santa Maria, and it enters Orcutt and Santa Maria as an expressway. 
The expressway runs all the way to Santa Maria Way. Highway 135 then turns 
into Broadway and runs through the heart of the city and all the way up 
to the Santa Maria River and U.S. 101. The Santa Maria Valley Railroad 
(SMVRR) is a shortline freight railroad to Guadalupe where the Union Pacific 
Railroad Interchange point is. Main business includes storage of railroad 
cars when northern California and southern California storage area are 
full. The nearest train station with long-distance Amtrak service is in 
Guadalupe, to which Amtrak provides bus service from Santa Maria. Amtrak's 
Pacific Surfliner provides twice daily service in each direction, running 
to San Luis Obispo to the north and to San Diego via Los Angeles to the 
south. SMAT, Santa Maria Area Transit, is a local bus service provided 
by both city and county-run lines, it has recently expanded its services 
during the evening that stretch to 10:15 P.M. The Breeze Bus provides service 
to Lompoc, Vandenberg Air Force Base, and Santa Maria. RTA Route 10 connects 
Santa Maria and San Luis Obispo. The Guadalupe Flyer connects Santa Maria 
and Guadalupe. Long-distance intercity bus service is provided by Greyhound 
Lines. The Clean Air Express commuter bus runs between Santa Maria and 
Goleta as well as a line to Santa Barbara weekdays. The Santa Maria Public 
Airport is served by two airlines, Allegiant Air and SkyWest Airlines with 
the latter operating as United Express on behalf of United Airlines. Allegiant 
Air operates nonstop jet service several days a week to Las Vegas. Skywest 
operates nonstop flights to Los Angeles (LAX) several times a day with 
turboprop aircraft via a code sharing agreement with United. Allan Hancock 
College is a California public community college located in northern Santa 
Barbara County. Allan Hancock College was ranked as one of the five best 
community colleges in California and one of the nation's top 120 community 
colleges.[25] Approximately 11,500 credit students enroll each semester 
at one of the college's four locations in Santa Maria, Lompoc, Solvang, 
or at Vandenberg Air Force Base.[26] The main campus is in Santa Maria, 
a 105-acre park-like setting that provides students with exceptional teaching 
and state of the art technology. Allan Hancock College is known for its 
distinguished athletic programs which have included former head football 
coaches John Madden and Ernie Zampese, as well as Gunther Cunningham. The 
college is also home to the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts, 
one of the state's finest theatre programs. The Santa Maria Joint Union 
High School District (SMJUHSD) is the oldest high school district in the 
State of California and runs the 3 primary public high schools in the area, 
including Santa Maria High School, Pioneer Valley High School,and Ernest 
Righetti High School. There are also four notable private schools in the 
valley, St. Joseph High School, St. Marys Catholic School, Valley Christian 
Academy, and Pacific Christian School Grades K-8th. The Santa Maria-Bonita 
School District is home to 13,700 students in 15 elementary schools (K-6th 
grade) and four junior high schools (7th-8th grade). The schools in the 
Santa Maria-Bonita School District serve students who live within the city 
limits of Santa Maria, the county area of Tanglewood and the county area 
just outside Santa Maria heading toward Guadalupe. The SMBSD schools are 
on a traditional calendar schedule and offer a quality, comprehensive education. 
The Orcutt Union School District serves students who live in the unincporporated 
community of Orcutt. The Orcutt Union School District recently added a 
new school known as Orcutt Academy High School in the 2008-2009 school 
year. It is located next to Orcutt Junior High School's campus on the old 
May Grisham campus. Santa Maria is also home to Santa Barbara Business 
College, which has been serving the community since 1982. Santa Maria is 
perhaps most notable for an excellent variety of barbecued meat. The tri-tip 
steak has its roots in Santa Maria[citation needed]. Tri-tip is a cut of 
beef from the bottom sirloin. It is a small triangular muscle, usually 
1.5 to 2.5 lb (680 to 1,130 g) per side of beef. In the United States, 
this cut was typically used for ground beef or sliced into steaks until 
the late 1950s, when it became a local specialty in Santa Maria. "Santa 
Maria-style" barbecue is usually used in reference to the seasoning of 
tri-tip or other meats (most notably top sirloin, or "top block") when 
rubbed with salt, pepper, and spices and cooked whole on a rotisserie or 
grilled over local red oak wood. The side dishes complementing a typical 
"Santa Maria-style" barbecue generally consist of garlic bread, pinquito 
beans, and a salad. Sunset Magazine's August 2013 issue features a 10-page 
spread on Santa Maria Style BBQ, crowning Santa Maria as "The West's Best 
BBQ Town".[11] Santa Maria, along with the neighboring Lompoc, Los Alamos 
and Santa Ynez Valleys, combine to create one of the nation's largest wine-producing 
regions, referred to as the Santa Barbara Wine Country. The often foggy 
and windswept Santa Maria Valley is the northern most appellation in Santa 
Barbara County. The region's first officially approved American Viticultural 
Area (AVA) enjoys extremely complex soil conditions and diverse microclimates. 
Chardonnay and Pinot noir are two varietals which especially benefit from 
the ocean's influence, and are the flagship wines of this appellation. 
Santa Maria Valley grapes are also used by wineries throughout Santa Barbara 
County and at many wineries outside of the county. The Santa Maria Valley 
name is used on labels from wineries that are based far away from the Santa 
Barbara County sunshine. The Santa Maria Valley appellation is bounded 
by the San Rafael Mountains and the Los Padres National Forest to the east, 
and by the Solomon Hills and the city of Santa Maria to the west. Santa 
Maria's Allan Hancock College is the home of The Pacific Conservatory of 
the Performing Arts (PCPA), a highly touted theatrical school and production 
company. Notable alumni include: Robin Williams, Kathy Bates, Kelly McGillis, 
Mercedes Ruehl, and Zac Efron. An additional PCPA theatre is located in 
Solvang, California in the Santa Ynez Valley. The Santa Maria Valley has 
long been a major filming location for Hollywood. Some of the films shot 
in the valley include: In the Space: 1999 episode "Another Time, Another 
Place", the "Earth" Alphans, during their period on Earth, have build a 
small village in the destroyed Santa Maria,[27] discovering that on Earth 
there was an Atlantis-like civilization. The Santa Maria Skate Park is 
located in Fletcher Park. There is also the Paul Nelson Aquatic Center/Abel
