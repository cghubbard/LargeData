Laraine Day (October 13, 1920 â€“ November 10, 2007) was an American actress 
and a former Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract star.[1] Day was born La Raine 
Johnson in Roosevelt, Utah, one of eight children in an affluent Mormon 
family. She had a twin brother, Lamar.[2] The family later moved to California 
where she began her acting career with the Long Beach Players. She was 
a 1938 graduate of Polytechnic High School in Long Beach, California. In 
1937, Day debuted onscreen in a bit part in Stella Dallas. Shortly afterwards, 
she won lead roles in several George O'Brien westerns at RKO, in which 
she was billed as "Laraine Hays" and then "Laraine Johnson". In 1939 she 
signed with MGM, and became popular and well-known (billed as Laraine Day) 
as "Nurse Mary Lamont", the title character's fiancee in a string of seven 
"Dr. Kildare" movies beginning with Calling Dr. Kildare (1939), with Lew 
Ayres in the title role. Her roles for other studios were often far more 
stimulating than those MGM gave her, including a prominent supporting part 
in the Irish melodrama My Son, My Son! (1940). She also starred in the 
Alfred Hitchcock thriller Foreign Correspondent (1940) with Joel McCrea, 
and the psychological mystery The Locket (1946) with Robert Mitchum, Brian 
Aherne, and Gene Raymond. In 1941 she was voted the number one "star of 
tomorrow" in Hollywood.[3] She was paired opposite major film stars, including 
Lana Turner, Cary Grant, and John Wayne, and hosted a TV show alternately 
called Daydreaming With Laraine or The Laraine Day Show (1951). During 
a time when she had a break in her film career she made her stage debut 
opposite Gregory Peck in the national theatre tour of Angel Street. She 
also made other stage appearances in Lost Horizon, the 1973 revival of 
The Women, and a revival of The Time of the Cuckoo.[4] In the 1940s she 
made guest appearances on radio in both Lux Radio Theatre and The Screen 
Guild Theater. Day's first marriage was to singer turned airport executive, 
James Ray Hendricks in 1942.[5] The couple adopted three children: Christopher, 
Angela and Michelle.[6] Day filed for divorce from Hendricks in December 
1946.[7] Day was granted an interlocutory divorce from Hendricks on January 
20, 1947, which required her to wait one year before remarrying.[8] On 
January 21, 1947, Day traveled to Juarez, Mexico where she received a second 
divorce decree. Later that day, she traveled to El Paso, Texas, where she 
married baseball manager Leo Durocher. Upon returning to California, the 
judge who granted Day's interlocutory divorce from Hendricks stated that 
the Mexican divorce she received was not legal and, since she failed to 
wait the one-year period for her divorce to become final, deemed her Texas 
marriage illegal as well. After waiting approximately one year, Day and 
Durocher remarried on February 16, 1948, in Santa Monica, California.[9] 
During her marriage to Durocher, Day was often referred to as "The First 
Lady of Baseball". While Durocher was managing the New York Giants, she 
wrote the book Day With the Giants (1952).[10] In 1952, she wrote and published 
another book entitled The America We Love. She was also the host of Day 
With the Giants, a 15-minute television interview program broadcast before 
New York Giants home games. Day and Durocher divorced in June 1960.[11] 
On March 7, 1961, Day married television producer Michael Grilikhes. She 
and Grilikhes had two daughters, Dana Laraine (born November 13, 1962) 
and Gigi (born October 6, 1964).[12][13] After their births, Day rarely 
appeared in films, and only occasionally appeared on TV, usually portraying 
matronly types. Day was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints (LDS Church). Throughout her life she never swore, smoked, or drank 
any kind of alcohol, coffee or tea. Until her death in 2007 she retained 
her Mormon faith, stating that: "It brings me comfort in a confusing world".[14] 
In 1961 she appeared with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in their production 
of Let Freedom Ring, which was an inspirational one-hour program dedicated 
to the spirit of American Freedom.[15] Day was, as she described herself, 
"very much a Republican".[16] She was a vocal supporter of Richard Nixon, 
with whom she later met at the 1968 Republican National Convention, citing 
him to be the type who would "go out of his way to help the American people".[17] 
In October 1960, Day appeared in the Nixon-Lodge Bumper Sticker Motorcade 
Campaign in Los Angeles along with Ginger Rogers, Cesar Romero, Irene Dunne, 
Dick Powell, Mary Pickford and John Payne.[18] In the 1970s she was the 
spokesperson for the Make America Better campaign and traveled across the 
country sharing her views on environmental issues.[19] In that same period 
of time she was active in establishing a playhouse in Los Angeles for Mormon 
actors and she helped bring Ray Bradbury's work to the attention of the 
public. Day had moved back to her native Utah in March 2007 following the 
death of her third husband. She died at the home of her daughter, Gigi 
Bell, in Ivins, Utah, from undisclosed causes, on November 10, 2007. She 
was 87 years old.[1][2] Her body was taken back to California and on November 
15, 2007 a memorial service was held at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the 
Hollywood Hills. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Laraine
