Evanston /ˈɛvənˌstən/ is a city in Cook County, Illinois, United States, 
12 miles (19 km) north of downtown Chicago, bordered by Chicago to the 
south, Skokie to the west, and Wilmette to the north, with a population 
of 74,486 as of 2010[update].[4] It is one of the North Shore communities 
that adjoin Lake Michigan. The boundaries of the city of Evanston are coterminous 
with those of Evanston Township – although school districts 65 and 202 
take in a small portion of eastern Skokie. Evanston is the home of Northwestern 
University. Prior to the 1830s, the area now occupied by Evanston was mainly 
uninhabited, consisting largely of wetlands and swampy forest. However, 
Potawatomi Indians used trails along higher lying ridges that ran in a 
general north-south direction through the area, and had at least some semi-permanent 
settlements along the trails. French explorers referred to the general 
area as "Grosse Pointe" after a point of land jutting into Lake Michigan 
about 13 miles (21 km) north of the mouth of the Chicago River. After the 
first non-Native Americans settled in the area in 1836, the names "Grosse 
Point Territory" and "Gross Point voting district" were used through the 
1830s and 1840s, although the territory had no defined boundaries.[5][6] 
The area remained only sparsely settled, supporting some farming and lumber 
activity on some of the higher ground, as well as a number of taverns or 
"hotels" along the ridge roads. In 1850, a township called Ridgeville was 
organized, extending from Graceland Cemetery in Chicago to the southern 
edge of the Ouilmette Reservation, along what is now Central Street, and 
from Lake Michigan to Western Avenue in Chicago. The 1850 census shows 
a few hundred settlers in this township,[6] and a post office with the 
name of Ridgeville was established at one of the taverns. However, no municipality 
yet existed. In 1851, a group of Methodist business leaders founded Northwestern 
University and Garrett Biblical Institute. They chose a bluffed and wooded 
site along the lake as Northwestern's home, purchasing several hundred 
acres of land from Dr. John Foster, a Chicago farm owner. In 1854, the 
founders of Northwestern submitted to the county judge their plans for 
a city to be named Evanston after John Evans,[7] one of their leaders. 
In 1857, the request was granted.[8] The township of Evanston was split 
off from Ridgeville Township; at approximately the same time, that portion 
of Ridgeville south of Devon Avenue was organized as Lake View Township.[9] 
The nine founders, including John Evans, Orrington Lunt, and Andrew Brown, 
hoped their university would attain high standards of intellectual excellence. 
Today these hopes have been fulfilled, as Northwestern consistently ranks 
with the best of the nation's universities. Evanston was formally incorporated 
as a town on December 29, 1863, but declined in 1869 to become a city despite 
the Illinois legislature passing a bill for that purpose. Evanston expanded 
after the Civil War with the annexation of the village of North Evanston. 
Finally, in early 1892, following the annexation of the village of South 
Evanston, voters elected to organize as a city.[10] The 1892 boundaries 
are largely those that exist today. During the 1960s, Northwestern University 
changed the city's shoreline by adding a 74-acre (30 ha) lakefill.[11] 
In 1939, Evanston hosted the first NCAA basketball championship final at 
Northwestern University's Patten Gymnasium.[12] In August 1954, Evanston 
hosted the second assembly of the World Council of Churches, still the 
only WCC assembly to have been held in the United States. President Dwight 
Eisenhower welcomed the delegates, and Dag Hammarskjöld, secretary-general 
of the United Nations, delivered an important address entitled "An instrument 
of faith".[13] Evanston first received power in April 1893. Many people 
lined the streets on Emerson St. where the first appearance of street lights 
were lined and turned on. Today, the city is home to Northwestern University, 
Music Institute of Chicago, and other educational institutions, as well 
as headquarters of Alpha Phi International women's fraternity, Rotary International, 
the National Merit Scholarship Corporation, the National Lekotek Center, 
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, the Sigma Chi Fraternity and the Woman's 
Christian Temperance Union. Evanston is the birthplace of Tinkertoys, and 
Evanston, along with Ithaca, New York, Two Rivers, Wisconsin, and Plainfield, 
Illinois, also lays claim to having originated the ice cream sundae.[14] 
Evanston was the home of the Clayton Mark and Company, which for many years 
supplied the most jobs.[15] Evanston was a dry community from 1858 until 
1972, when the City Council voted to allow restaurants and hotels to serve 
liquor on their premises. In 1984, the Council voted to allow retail liquor 
outlets within the city limits.[16] According to the 2010 census, Evanston 
has a total area of 7.802 square miles (20.21 km2), of which 7.78 square 
miles (20.15 km2) (or 99.72%) is land and 0.022 square miles (0.06 km2) 
(or 0.28%) is water.[17] As of the census of 2010, there were 74,486 people 
(up from 74,239 at the 2000 census), 30,047 households, and 15,621 families 
residing in the city. The population density was 9,574.0 people per square 
mile (3,687.4/km²). There were 33,181 housing units at an average density 
of 4,264.9 per square mile (1,642.6/km²). The 2010 census showed that Evanston 
is ethnically mixed with the following breakdown in population: 65.6% White, 
18.1% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian or Alaska Native, 
8.6% Asian, 0.02% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 3.6% some 
other race, and 3.8% from two or more races. 9.0% were Hispanic or Latino 
of any race.[4] There were 30,047 households, out of which 26.1% had children 
under the age of 18 living with them, 39.8% were headed by married couples 
living together, 9.7% had a female householder with no husband present, 
and 48.0% were non-families. 37.5% of all households were made up of individuals, 
and 10.5% were someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 2.25, and the average family size was 3.05.[4] 
The median age was 34.3 years, with 19.3% under the age of 18, 16.8% from 
18 to 24, 27.8% from 25 to 44, 24.0% from 45 to 64, and 12.2% who were 
65 years of age or older. For every 100 females there were 91.0 males. 
For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.0 males.[4] As of 
2011[update], the estimated median income for a household in the city was 
$60,033, and the median income for a family was $102,706. Male full-time 
workers had a median income of $66,106 versus $52,727 for females. The 
per capita income for the city was $40,732. About 6.4% of families and 
12.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.1% of 
those under age 18 and 6.5% of those age 65 or over.[2] 12.3% of Evanston's 
9,259 businesses are Black owned.[20] Evanston has a council-manager system 
of government and is divided into nine wards, each of which is represented 
by an Alderman, or member of the Evanston City Council. As of 2014[update], 
the mayor is Elizabeth Tisdahl, replacing longtime mayor Lorraine H. Morton. 
In the April 2009, municipal elections, Ald. Elizabeth Tisdahl won a landslide 
victory in the race for mayor over three opponents in a low-turnout election.[21] 
Evanston was heavily Republican in voter identification from the time of 
the Civil War up to the 1960s. Nixon carried Evanston in the 1968 presidential 
election.[22] The city began trending Democratic and now almost exclusively 
identifies with candidates affiliated with the Democratic Party in elections 
on all levels of government. In the 2004 presidential election, Democratic 
candidate John Kerry won 82% of Evanston's vote. His Republican opponent 
and the nationwide winner, President George W. Bush, only won 17% of the 
vote in Evanston.[citation needed] In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama won approximately 
87% of the vote in Evanston over Republican Senator John McCain.[23] Most 
of Evanston (and a small part of the village of Skokie) is within the boundaries 
of Evanston Township High School District 202. The school district has 
a single high school, Evanston Township High School, with an enrollment 
of just over 3,500, covering grades 9 through 12. Evanston-Skokie Community 
Consolidated School District 65, covering all of Evanston and a small part 
of Skokie, provides primary education from pre-kindergarten through grade 
8. The district has ten elementary schools (kindergarten through fifth 
grade), three middle schools (grades 6 through 8), two magnet schools (K 
through 8), two special schools or centers, and an early childhood school. 
Dr. Paul Goren is the Superintendent of Schools. Private schools located 
in Evanston, Illinois include: The Evanston Public Library was established 
in 1873,[33] and has three branches as of 2013[update].[34] Evanston's 
growth occurred largely because of its accessibility from Chicago by rail. 
The Northwestern founders did not finalize their commitment to siting the 
university there until they were assured the Chicago & Milwaukee Railway 
line would run there. C&M trains began stopping in Evanston in 1855.[35] 
Evanston later experienced rapid growth as one of the first streetcar suburbs. 
The North Shore Line which gave the area its nickname started at Church 
Street in Evanston and continued up to Waukegan. The city is still connected 
to Chicago by rail transit. The CTA's Purple Line, part of the Chicago 
'L' system, runs through Evanston. From its terminal at Howard in Chicago, 
the line heads north to the South Boulevard, Main, Dempster, Davis, Foster, 
Noyes, and Central stations, before terminating at the Linden station in 
Wilmette, Illinois. Metra's Union Pacific/North Line also serves Evanston, 
with stations at Main Street, Davis Street and Central Street, the first 
two being adjacent to Purple Line stations. The CTA's Yellow Line also 
runs through the city, though it does not stop there. Evanston is served 
by six CTA bus routes as well as four Pace bus routes. Active modes of 
transportation include miles of sidewalks and bicycle lanes. The largest 
automobile routes from Chicago to Evanston include Lake Shore Drive, the 
Edens Expressway (I-94), and McCormick Boulevard, although the first two 
of those do not extend to Evanston itself and require driving through Rogers 
Park (via Sheridan Road or Ridge Avenue) and Skokie, respectively. The 
main routes from the north are the Edens, Green Bay Road, and Sheridan 
Road. As of 2015, according to the State of Illinois Dept Commerce and 
Economic Opportunity and Individual Employers,[36] the top employers in 
the city are: Once the home of one of the first Marshall Field's[37][38] 
and Sears stores in suburbia, Evanston remains an important shopping destination 
for the north suburbs and North Side of Chicago, with numerous commercial 
centers throughout the city. The principal ones are as follows: Two hospitals 
are located within Evanston's city limits: A perennial debate in Evanston 
is the issue of Northwestern University's status as a tax-exempt institution. 
In the founding charter of Northwestern University, signed in 1851, the 
state granted the school an exemption from paying property taxes, and unlike 
other well-off private universities with statutory exemptions,[55] it provides 
its own police services, but not firefighter/paramedic services. It pays 
water, sewer, communications, real property transfer taxes, and building 
permit fees, but not property taxes. Northwestern does not make Payments 
in Lieu of Taxes for the real estate it removes from property tax rolls. 
Northwestern's critics allege that it consumes far more from the city than 
it contributes. However, its backers, like former Evanston mayor and Northwestern 
alumna Lorraine H. Morton, contend that the benefits of having an elite 
research institution justify Northwestern's tax status.[56] These supporters 
highlight the fact that Northwestern University is the largest employer 
in Evanston,[57] and that its students and faculty constitute a large consumer 
base for Evanston businesses. This controversy was revived in 2003 when 
the university purchased an eight-story office building downtown, removing 
it from the tax rolls. An advisory referendum put on the April elections 
ballot, dubbed by supporters as a "Fair Share Initiative", received a majority, 
but was not passed into ordinance by the City Council. In September 2009, 
Northwestern purchased a fire truck for the city of Evanston at a cost 
of $550,000. Northwestern President Morton Schapiro stated, "We are pleased 
to fund the purchase of this new fire engine, which was the top priority 
of the City in our discussions with how we might assist the City financially."[58] 
Evanston's variety of housing and commercial districts, combined with easy 
access to Chicago, make it a popular filming location. Evanston as of December 
2008 is listed as a filming location for 65 different films, notably those 
of John Hughes.[59] Much of the 1984 film Sixteen Candles was filmed in 
and around Evanston,[60] as was the 1993 film Dennis the Menace,[61] and 
the 1997 film Home Alone 3.[62] A number of scenes from the 1986 Garry 
Marshall film Nothing in Common were filmed on the Northwestern University 
campus and Evanston's lakeshore.[63] Although not filmed there, the 2004 
film Mean Girls is set in the Evanston suburbs, and makes several references 
to the area. In the 2003 film Cheaper by the Dozen, the family moves to 
Evanston.[64] Additionally, the baseball movie Rookie of the Year, featuring 
Gary Busey and Thomas Ian Nicholas, was partially shot at Haven Middle 
School.[65] In The Princess Bride, according to IMDB, the screenplay says 
that the boy and his grandfather live in Evanston.[66] This was also stated 
by Mandy Patinkin in a behind-the-scenes interview.[67] The story's author, 
William Goldman, was born in Chicago and grew up in Highland Park just 
a couple of miles away from Evanston. Evanston has gained recognition and 
reputation for efforts related to sustainability, including those by government, 
citizens, and institutions. In 2015, the city was named the World Wildlife 
Fund's Earth Hour Capital after competing against cities including Seattle 
and Cleveland. In 2016, Evanston was again a finalist in the competition.[68] 
In October 2006, the city voted to sign the United States Conference of 
Mayors Climate Protection Agreement,[69] and a number of citizen task forces 
convened to develop a plan to reduce the city's carbon footprint.[70] The 
Evanston Climate Action Plan ("ECAP"), accepted by the City Council in 
November 2008, suggested over 200 strategies to make Evanston more sustainable, 
principally by reducing carbon emissions associated with transportation, 
buildings, energy sources, waste, and food production.[71][72] In June 
2011, the United States Conference of Mayors awarded Evanston first place 
in the small city category of the Mayors' Climate Protection Awards, based 
largely on the city's use of the ECAP, which the city asserts has reduced 
emissions by 24,000 metric tons per year.[73][74] On September 15, 2011, 
Wal-Mart presented Mayor Tisdahl with a $15,000 award in recognition of 
the honor, which the mayor donated to Citizens' Greener Evanston.[citation 
needed] An Evanston Strategic Plan passed on March 27, 2006, aspired to 
create the most livable city in America and to promote the highest quality 
of life for all residents.[75] One goal is to create and maintain functionally 
appropriate, sustainable, accessible high quality infrastructure and facilities. 
This includes continual development of an environmentally sensitive lakefront 
and implementation of a comprehensive long-range infrastructure plan. Another 
goal is to protect the city's natural resources and to build environment, 
not destroy it. The city also wants to improve its transportation resources 
to be more safe, integrated, accessible, responsive, and energy-efficient. 
Evanston has an environment board[76] and an office of sustainability.[77] 
The single largest carbon-reducing strategy identified in the ECAP, the 
development of an offshore wind farm in Lake Michigan,[78] gained widespread 
attention.[79] In April 2010, Evanston's City Council voted to authorize 
issuing a Request for Information (RFI) so that interested parties could 
provide information on developing a wind energy facility 4 miles (6 km) 
off the coast of Lake Michigan.[80] Following the receipt of responses, 
the Mayor appointed a committee to evaluate the information received. The 
committee's report was accepted in spring 2011, and the City Council voted 
to move forward with exploration of the concept. In the meantime, Evanston 
legislators introduced legislation, signed into law in summer 2011, creating 
a state offshore wind council to propose how to regulate possible development 
of such projects.[citation needed] Northwestern University's Ford Engineering 
Design Center is a LEED Silver certified building,[81] and the Jewish Reconstructionist 
Congregation has built a LEED Platinum certified synagogue.[82] Not-for-profit 
groups active on environmental issues include Citizens' Greener Evanston,[83] 
an outgrowth of the hundreds of citizens who participated in the creation 
of the Climate Action Plan, the Business Alliance for a Sustainable Evanston,[84] 
a coalition of local businesses committed to advancing environmental sustainability 
and economic progress in Evanston's commercial sector, The Talking Farm, 
an organization devoted to sustainable urban farming, and the Evanston 
Environmental Association, who organizes an annual "Green Living Festival"
