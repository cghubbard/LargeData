The Winter Meetings are an annual event, held each December, in which representatives 
of all 30 Major League Baseball teams and their 160 minor league baseball 
affiliates convene for four days to discuss league business and conduct 
off-season trades and transactions. Attendees include league executives, 
team owners, general managers, team scouts, visitors from baseball-playing 
countries, trade show exhibitors, and people seeking employment with minor 
league organizations.[1][2][3] The Rule 5 draft, in which minor league 
players who are not on a team's 40-man roster can be drafted by a major 
league team, is held on the last day of the meetings.[4] In 2015, the 114th 
annual Winter Meetings were held from December 7 to 10 in Nashville, Tennessee.[5] 
The 2016 Winter Meetings are scheduled for December 4 to 8 at the Gaylord 
National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland.[6] The 
tradition of baseball holding off-season meetings during December dates 
back to 1876, the first offseason of the National League. At the 1876 meetings, 
William Hulbert was selected to be the league's president, and two teams 
(the New York Mutuals and Philadelphia Athletics) were expelled from the 
league for failing to play all their scheduled games.[citation needed] 
The Winter Meetings became an annual event in 1901. The Winter Meetings 
attract several thousand participants; in 2014 organizers anticipated 3,000 
attendees. These include team owners, field managers, team scouts, players' 
agents, lawyers and accountants specializing in baseball, and visitors 
from baseball-playing countries.[1][7][8] Baseball players generally do 
not attend, although free agents come to introduce themselves to many teams.[7] 
At the 2014 Winter Meetings in San Diego, an estimated 750 media personnel 
received press passes.[9] Receptions are held nightly by each of the 30 
major league teams for their minor league affiliates.[10] A luncheon is 
also held for major league managers and baseball reporters.[11] With all 
the principals in one place, the Winter Meetings are typically the site 
of player trades and free-agent signings.[12] However, the informal meetings 
that used to take place in hotel lobbies up until the end of the 20th century 
have been replaced by texting and emailing; most interactions take place 
in the privacy of suites due to the preponderance of media personnel and 
fans converging on the site.[9][11] Among the notable trades and signings 
that have been made at the Winter Meetings are: Concurrent with the Winter 
Meetings, a trade show featuring close to 300 vendors of baseball equipment, 
services, and promotions takes place.[7] Another annual event is the Professional 
Baseball Employment Opportunities Job Fair, during which recent college 
graduates seeking internships and employment with minor league organizations 
schedule on-site interviews.[17] The month of December is considered "the 
height of baseball hiring season", as 400 to 500 workers are hired each 
year.[18] Since 1951, the "King of Baseball" title has been awarded to 
a minor league veteran at the Winter Meetings banquet.[19] Several events 
associated with the Hall of Fame also take place at the Winter Meetings:
