Ryan Joseph Braun (born November 17, 1983) is an American baseball left 
fielder for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). While 
currently the starting left fielder for the Brewers, Braun has also played 
right field during his career and was also a third baseman during his rookie 
season. Braun was a two-time All-American at the University of Miami, where 
he was named "National Freshman of the Year" by Baseball America in 2003. 
The Brewers drafted him in the first round (fifth overall) in the 2005 
MLB draft. He was the team's Minor League Player of the Year in 2006. Braun 
is considered a five-tool player for his ability to hit for power and average, 
his baserunning speed, and his excellent fielding and arm strength.[1] 
He was ranked number seven by the Sporting News in its 2012 list of the 
50 greatest current players in baseball. He was awarded the National League's 
Rookie of the Year in 2007, has won five Silver Slugger awards (2008–12), 
and won the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2011. He 
was named to five straight All-Star games (2008–12), and then a team-high 
sixth game in 2015. Braun has led the NL three times in slugging percentage 
(in 2007, while setting the major league rookie record, 2011, and 2012), 
three times in extra-base hits (2008, 2011–12), and once each in hits (2009), 
home runs (2012), and runs (2012). On defense, he led all major league 
outfielders in fielding percentage in 2008, led NL left fielders in fielding 
percentage twice (2009 and 2011), and led NL left fielders in range factor 
in 2009 and 2012. His 128 home runs through 2010 were the 8th-most by any 
major leaguer ever through their first four seasons. Through 2015, he was 
sixth among all active ballplayers in career slugging percentage, and third 
among active left fielders in career fielding percentage. Braun came under 
scrutiny for a testosterone test that he failed in 2011, and then for his 
connection in 2012 to the Biogenesis of America clinic that provided performance-enhancing 
drugs to professional baseball players. After MLB's investigation following 
the Biogenesis scandal, on July 22, 2013, Braun was suspended without pay 
for the remainder of the 2013 season and playoffs (totaling 65 regular 
season games) for violating the league's drug policy.[2] The two seasons 
following Braun's return from the suspension have seen his career-lows 
for full seasons in the major leagues in terms of hits, batting average, 
RBI and home runs.[3] Ryan Braun was born on November 17, 1983 to Joe and 
Diane Braun. He and his younger brother Steve were raised in Los Angeles. 
Ryan began playing tee-ball around the age of four, on a team coached by 
his father. PONY League teammates included Jack and Matt Cassel, Jason 
and Jarron Collins, as well as Jon Garland. Braun later picked up basketball, 
which became his favorite sport, and soccer, in which he played forward. 
By the time he entered high school, Braun chose to focus solely on baseball.[4] 
Braun attended Granada Hills High School in Granada Hills, Los Angeles, 
California. He was a four-year letterman on the school's baseball team, 
and three-year team captain and Most Valuable Player (MVP). He played shortstop, 
and pitched through his junior year. As a sophomore in 2000, he recorded 
the highest batting average of his prep career (.456), while posting a 
.654 on-base percentage (OBP). During his junior year, he hit .421, with 
a .668 OBP. Braun capped off his high school career by batting .451 as 
a senior, with an OBP of .675, and breaking the school record for career 
home runs with 25.[5] He was a two-time all-area selection by the Los Angeles 
Times, and a three-time choice by the Los Angeles Daily News. As a senior, 
Braun was rated the sixth-best shortstop prospect in the country by Team 
One Baseball, and among the top 100 overall prospects by Baseball America.[6] 
He graduated in 2002, but went undrafted as he told teams that he intended 
to attend college.[7][8] Braun excelled academically as well—his worst 
grade was one B, in Advanced Placement Chemistry.[9][10] Offered baseball 
scholarships by Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, 
he instead attended the University of Miami on an academic scholarship, 
due to his excellent high school grades.[9] He chose Miami for its academics, 
its athletics, and its social scene, noting: "I think the girls were the 
deal closer on the recruiting trip."[8][11] There, Braun was named "National 
Freshman of the Year", and a first-team "Freshman All-American", by Baseball 
America in 2003, as well as first team All American by the Jewish Sports 
Review.[12] He was also named first-team All-American by Collegiate Baseball.[7] 
During his junior year, his final and most successful at Miami, Braun batted 
.396 with 18 home runs, a .726 slugging percentage, 76 RBIs and 23 stolen 
bases. He was ninth in slugging and 10th in RBIs in NCAA Division I, and 
was named to Baseball America's 2005 College All-American Team as the DH. 
He moved from shortstop to third base during the year. His performance 
earned Braun the Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Player of the Year 
award, and a spot as one of the finalists for the Golden Spikes Award, 
the most prestigious individual award in college baseball.[7][13] The Milwaukee 
Brewers drafted Braun in the first round (fifth overall) in the 2005 major 
league draft as a third baseman, and he signed for $2.45 million.[14] Assigned 
to the Helena Brewers in the Advanced Rookie Pioneer League in 2005, Braun 
batted .341/.383/.585 in 10 games. He was then promoted to the West Virginia 
Power in the Class A South Atlantic League, where he hit .355/.396/.645, 
and was rated the fifth-best prospect in the league.[15] His most memorable 
moment there was when he hit a walk-off grand slam to lead the Power into 
the playoffs.[16] Braun began 2006 playing for the A-Advanced Brevard County 
Manatees. He earned a spot in the Florida State League All-Star game, and 
played in the All-Star Futures Game. He was rated the top third base prospect 
in the FSL, and Baseball America rated him the best batting prospect in 
the league. On June 21, Braun was promoted to the Class AA Huntsville Stars 
(Alabama) of the Southern League. In July he was voted the Brewers' Organizational 
Player of the Month, and at the end of the season he was voted the sixth-best 
prospect in the Southern League.[17] Collectively between Class A and Class 
AA, Braun finished with a .289 average, 22 home runs, 77 RBIs, and 26 stolen 
bases. He received the 2006 Robin Yount Performance Award as the Milwaukee 
Brewers Minor League Player of the Year.[18] Later in 2006, in the Arizona 
Fall League he hit .326/.396/.641 in 92 at bats for the Scottsdale Scorpions.[19] 
He led the AFL with 16 extra-base hits, tied for tops with 9 doubles, ranked 
second in slugging percentage and HR/AB ratio (1/15), tied for second in 
home runs (6), and tied for third in RBIs (25). He was rated one of the 
top three prospects in the league, and was voted to the AFL All-Prospects 
Team.[19][20] Baseball America rated Braun the Brewers' #2 prospect for 
2007.[17] He began the year with the Nashville Sounds of the AAA Pacific 
Coast League. Before being called up to the majors in late May, in 113 
at bats he led the PCL with a .726 slugging percentage while batting .354 
(6th), with 10 home runs (T-2nd) and a .426 on-base percentage (5th).[21] 
The Brewers brought Braun to spring training in 2007.[19] Their regular 
third baseman Corey Koskie was suffering from post-concussion syndrome, 
and missed the entire year.[22] In 11 spring training games, Braun tied 
for 10th in the majors in home runs (5), and second in RBIs (15).[23][24] 
In 2007, Braun had what some sportswriters called one of the most dominant 
rookie seasons in baseball history.[25] Called up on May 24 by the Brewers, 
he hit his first major league home run two nights later.[26][27][28][29] 
Braun was voted the National League (NL) Rookie of the Month for June, 
ranking first in RBIs (21) and tied for first in home runs (6) among NL 
rookies that month. He also recorded a .716 slugging percentage and a .435 
OBP.[30] In July, Braun became the fastest in Brewer history to hit 10 
major league home runs, doing so in his 38th game.[31] He hit his 15th 
home run in the 50th game of his career, and his 20th in his 64th game, 
making him the fastest to those milestones since Albert Pujols in 2001. 
He was also the fastest to 20 homers in Brewers history.[32][33] At month's 
end, he received his second consecutive NL Rookie of the Month Award, as 
well as his first NL Player of the Month Award (making him the first player 
to have won both awards in the same month). He hit a league-leading 11 
home runs, with 25 RBIs, while batting .345.[34] In mid-August, Yost moved 
Braun from third in the batting order to cleanup, switching him with Prince 
Fielder. The move was expected to allow Braun to steal more, as batting 
before Fielder was not conducive to him risking being thrown out on steal 
attempts. Additionally, successfully stealing a base would hypothetically 
allow opponents to intentionally walk Fielder and avoid pitching to him.[35] 
At the end of the month, however, Yost reverted to his previous batting 
order.[36] On August 26, Braun hit his 25th home run in his 82nd game, 
quicker than any major leaguer since Mark McGwire in 1987.[37][38] On September 
9, the Brewers became the third team in major league history to start a 
game with three straight home runs, as Rickie Weeks, J. J. Hardy, and Braun 
homered in consecutive at bats. Braun said, "That was pretty cool. I was 
never part of something like that before."[39] Braun's home run in that 
game also broke the Brewers rookie record for home runs (28).[40] Braun 
hit his 30th homer in his 94th game, a pace no player had set to start 
a career since McGwire hit 30 in 84 games during 1986 and 1987.[41] Braun 
finished with an NL-leading .634 slugging percentage, a mark that set new 
all-time rookie and Brewers records.[42][43] He was fifth in the league 
in at bats per home run (13.3) and OPS (1.004), tied for fifth in home 
runs (34), and eighth in batting average (.324) among hitters with at least 
490 plate appearances.[44] He led the Brewers in batting average and slugging 
percentage, and was second behind Fielder in home runs, runs (91), and 
RBIs (97), tied for second in triples (6), and third in OBP (.370) and 
steals (15), despite not having played in the first 48 games of the season.[45] 
Braun obliterated the club rookie records of 28 home runs and 81 RBIs, 
set by Fielder in 2006.[46] "I was always small. I was a leadoff hitter 
growing up, until I was 13 or 14 years old and had a little growth spurt 
and started hitting home runs." Braun had considerable success against 
left-handed pitchers. He had the best batting average (.450), OBP (.516), 
and slugging percentage (.964) of any major league hitter with at least 
125 plate appearances against lefties, and was tied for second in the majors 
in home runs (15).[48][49] Braun credits his father with his success against 
lefties. "My dad is left-handed, so growing up, the majority of time, I 
took batting practice off of him."[50] Braun collected several awards at 
season's end. He won the 2007 NL Rookie of the Year Award in a vote by 
32 members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. He beat out 
Troy Tulowitzki by 2 points in the closest NL vote since the system was 
revised in 1980.[51] Of all prior NL Rookies of the Year, only Pujols and 
Willie McCovey hit for higher batting averages in their rookie year.[52] 
Braun was voted the 2007 NL Sporting News Rookie of the Year by 488 major 
league players and 30 managers.[53][54] Braun also received the 2007 Players 
Choice NL Most Outstanding Rookie in a vote by his fellow major league 
players.[55] "When your peers recognize you with an award, that's great", 
he said. "Those are the guys out there on the field with you, competing 
against you. Their opinion counts the most, for a player."[56] In voting 
for the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, Braun received two 10th-place 
votes and finished 24th overall.[57] In March 2008, the Brewers renewed 
Braun's contract for $455,000, a $75,000 increase.[58] Braun then signed 
an 8-year, $45–$51 million contract extension (the total depending on his 
"Super 2" service-time ranking after the 2009 season) on May 15, 2008.[59] 
The contract is through the year 2015. The deal included Braun's $455,000 
salary for 2008, and a $2.3 million bonus in 2008. It could increase to 
$51 million through incentives. Braun also has a no-trade clause for the 
first four years, and then a limited no-trade clause allowing him to block 
deals to 12 teams from 2012 to 2013, and 6 teams from 2014 to 2015. The 
contract will keep Braun locked up through his age-31 season.[60] It was 
the largest contract in Brewers' history, surpassing Jeff Suppan's. It 
was also the largest contract in baseball history given to a player with 
less than three years' experience.[61] Braun's agent, Nez Balelo, crunched 
enough numbers to show him what he potentially could have made over the 
life of this contract if he had chosen not to sign it. "But the question 
I ultimately asked myself was, `What can't I buy with that amount of money?"' 
Braun said.[62] Braun drove in 134 runs in his first 162 games in the majors, 
more RBIs than any active player.[63][64] He reached the 150-RBI milestone 
faster than any major leaguer since Boston's Walt Dropo needed only 155 
games, in 1949–51. On June 17, 2008, he drove in his 152nd career RBI, 
in his 182nd game.[65] Braun was named the NL's Player of the Month, after 
batting .366 in July (6th in the NL) with 9 home runs (3rd), and 23 RBIs 
(7th). He also led the league with 76 total bases and 18 extra base hits, 
and was among NL leaders with 37 hits (2nd), 3 triples (2nd), and a 1.163 
OPS (3rd). He had back-to-back 4-hit games, just the 5th player in team 
history to accomplish that feat.[66] "It's a huge honor", Braun said. "The 
way I look at it, you're the MVP of the National League for that month. 
It's definitely a big accomplishment.[67] As of August 8, Braun's major 
league career start was one of the best ever. In 227 games to start a career, 
he was first with 558 total bases and 133 extra base hits, second with 
64 home runs, and tied for second with 181 RBIs.[68] On August 9, Braun 
strained the intercostal muscles around his oblique ribcage. That led to 
him missing a number of games, and shortening his swing for a few weeks.[69][70] 
After returning, on September 25 he hit his first grand slam in "grand" 
fashion. With the bases loaded, he delivered a 2-out, 2–2 pitch from the 
Pirates' Jesse Chavez into the left field bleachers of Miller Park in the 
bottom of the 10th inning, winning the game 5–1, and keeping the Brewers' 
2008 postseason hopes alive. Three days later, Braun helped put the Brewers 
into the postseason for the first time since 1982, by hitting a go-ahead 
2-run homer in the bottom of the 8th against the Chicago Cubs. The homer 
was the difference in the game, which gave the Brewers a one-game lead 
over the New York Mets for the NL wild card. Braun was a starting outfielder 
for the NL in the 2008 All Star Game. He finished first in fan voting among 
NL outfielders, and second among all NL players, with 3,835,840 votes, 
behind only Chase Utley of the Phillies (3,889,602).[71] He also finished 
first in player voting.[72] Braun was the first Brewers outfielder voted 
to start an All Star game.[73] He was one of seven first-time starters 
in the game, and–along with Kosuke Fukudome and Josh Hamilton–one of only 
three who had not reached the major leagues until 2007 or 2008.[71] Braun 
came in third in the Home Run Derby at Yankee Stadium. "It's something 
you dream about", Braun said. "That's as big a stage as you can get on.... 
it's going to be a lot of fun."[74] He had his friend and agent, Nez Balelo, 
a former minor league infielder, pitch to him.[75][76] Braun's longest 
homer was estimated at 448 feet.[77] He hit seven home runs in each of 
the first and second rounds, finishing with 14 (three behind finalist Justin 
Morneau, who hit five in the final round to win the Derby).[78] On June 
3, Braun became the third-fastest major leaguer to reach 50 career home 
runs. He did so in 171 career games; the only players to reach that plateau 
sooner were Rudy York and Mark McGwire.[79][80] On July 8, Braun hit his 
56th home run in his 200th game, the third-highest total ever in a major 
leaguer's initial 200 games, behind McGwire (59) and York (59).[81] In 
early August, Braun hit his 30th home run, becoming just the second player 
in MLB history to hit 30 or more homers in each of his first two seasons.[70][82] 
Braun hit 71 home runs in his first two seasons, tying him with Pujols 
for fourth all-time. Joe DiMaggio tops the list with 75 home runs, followed 
by Ralph Kiner (74) and Eddie Mathews (72).[68][83][84] In 2008, in 151 
games Braun hit 37 home runs (tied for 4th in the NL, behind Ryan Howard, 
Adam Dunn, and Carlos Delgado), with 106 RBIs (9th), and batted .285 with 
a .553 slugging percentage (5th).[85] He also led the league with 83 extra 
base hits, and had 338 total bases (2nd in the NL), 7 triples (6th), 16.5 
at-bats-per-home-run (10th), and 611 at bats (10th).[86] 12.5% of his plate 
appearances were extra base hits (3rd in the NL; behind Ryan Ludwick and 
Pujols), he had 29 infield hits (7th), and he stole third base 6 times 
(9th).[87][88] Against starting pitchers, Braun hit .244 the first time 
he faced them in a game, .331 the second time, and .328 with a .672 slugging 
percentage the third time.[89] Braun led the Brewers in batting average, 
slugging percentage, triples, home runs, RBIs, extra base hits, total bases, 
at-bats-per-home run, OPS (.888), runs (92), and hits (174).[90] Braun 
hit .313 in October against the Phillies in his first postseason series, 
which the Brewers lost 3–1. Braun was voted to the 2008 NL Sporting News 
All Star Team, by a panel of 41 major league general managers and assistant 
general managers.[91] He also won the 2008 NL Outfielder Silver Slugger 
Award, in a vote by major league coaches and managers who select the top 
offensive performer at each position in both leagues. The award, sponsored 
by Louisville Slugger, is based on a combination of statistics, including 
batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage, as well as 
the coaches' and managers' general impressions of a player's overall offensive 
value.[92] In voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, Braun was third (with 139 
points), behind Pujols and Ryan Howard.[93] In 2009, Braun was named to 
Sporting News' list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, ranking 
No. 32. A panel of 100 baseball people, many of them members of the Hall 
of Fame and winners of major baseball awards, were polled to arrive at 
the list.[94] Braun was invited to play for Team USA in 2009 in the second 
World Baseball Classic. "I'm really excited to get to represent my country", 
he said. "It's an honor just to get invited for the event."[95] He batted 
.381 as the team's starting left fielder, helping it reach the semi-finals.[96][97] 
"One thing is for certain: You've got to tie Braun up from time to time. 
If you don't, he's going to feast on you."[98] Braun was named NL Player 
of the Week for May 4–10, after leading the NL with 12 RBIs for the week 
while hitting .458/.567/.958 with 3 home runs. He hit the second grand 
slam of his career and recorded a career-high six RBIs on May 6, and on 
May 9 he reached base in all five of his plate appearances.[99] Braun led 
all NL outfielders in fan voting for the All Star Game for the second year 
in a row, with 4.1 million votes, ahead of Raúl Ibáñez and Carlos Beltrán.[100] 
He was third among all NL vote-getters, trailing Pujols and Chase Utley.[101] 
He was the first Brewer to be voted in as a starter in consecutive years 
since Robin Yount (in 1982 and 1983), and the third Brewer position player 
voted to start twice, along with Yount and Paul Molitor (1980 and 1988).[102][103] 
Braun started in right field, the first time he had ever played the position, 
and batted cleanup, going 0–2.[104] Braun was second all-time, with 79 
home runs over his first two calendar years in the major leagues, to Phillies 
Hall of Famer Chuck Klein (83); ahead of third-place Joe DiMaggio and Mark 
McGwire (77).[105] If Braun continues to hit home runs at the rate he had 
hit them through July 1, 2009, he will reach 600 home runs in his 15th 
major league season.[106] In September, Braun became the second-fastest 
active player to hit 100 home runs (behind only Ryan Howard), as he hit 
his 100th homer in his 400th major league game.[107] Later in the month, 
he became the second player in major league history to hit 30 or more home 
runs in each of his first three seasons.[108] Braun's 103 home runs in 
his first three Major League seasons are sixth-most in baseball history, 
behind Pujols (114), Mark Teixeira (107), and three Hall of Famers—Kiner 
(114), Matthews (112), and Joe DiMaggio (107).[109] As in 2007, in 2009 
Braun had even greater success against left-handed pitchers. Against them 
he had the second-best OBP (.475), slugging percentage (.723), and OPS 
(1.198), and third-best batting average (.395), of all NL hitters with 
at least 125 plate appearances.[110] He finished the season with an NL-leading 
203 hits, becoming the first Brewer to lead his league in hits since Molitor 
topped the AL in 1991.[111] Braun became the fourth Brewer in team history 
to collect 200 or more hits in a season, and the first in 18 years.[112] 
His .320 batting average at the end of the season was the highest by a 
Brewer since Jeff Cirillo hit .326 in 1999.[113] In 2009, in addition to 
leading the NL in hits, Braun was 2nd in runs (113), 4th in RBIs (114), 
total bases (350), extra base hits (77), and hit by pitch (13), 7th in 
batting average (.320) and power-speed number (24.6), 8th in OPS (.937), 
9th in slugging percentage (.551) and doubles (39), tied for 10th in triples 
(6), and tied for 11th in home runs (32).[114] He was also 4th in the league 
in infield hits (25).[115] He became only the second Brewer ever to hit 
30 home runs and steal 20 bases in the same season.[116] Braun also became 
the eighth player in major league history with at least 100 runs, 100 RBIs, 
200 hits, 30 homers, 20 stolen bases, and a .300 average in the same season.[109] 
Braun was voted to the NL Sporting News All Star Team in 2009, making it 
for the second year in a row. He received votes from all 14 voting NL team 
executives (as did Pujols and Utley; Mauer was named on all AL ballots).[117] 
Braun was awarded the 2009 NL Outfielder Silver Slugger Award, winning 
it for the second year in a row.[109] He became the first Brewer since 
Molitor, more than two decades prior, to win a Silver Slugger Award in 
consecutive years. Cecil Cooper is the only other Brewer to have done it.[109] 
Braun was named to Sporting News' 2010 list of the 50 greatest current 
players in baseball, ranking No. 22.[118] He was elected a starting NL 
All Star outfielder for the third year in a row, in 2010.[119] Braun led 
all major league outfielders in All Star votes for the third straight year, 
with 2,972,525, despite Milwaukee being the smallest media market in the 
majors.[119][120] As in 2009, he received more votes than any NL players 
other than Pujols and Utley.[121] He became the first Brewer to be a three-time 
All Star starter, passing Yount and Molitor.[119] Braun was named NL Player 
of the Week for August 1–8, after leading the majors with a .538 batting 
average, 14 hits, and 8 runs scored, and notching a career-best five-hit 
performance in one game.[122][123] For the season, Braun was second in 
the NL in hits (188) and doubles (45), 5th in total bases (310), 6th in 
runs (101), 7th in RBIs (103) and extra base hits (71), and 9th in batting 
average (.304).[124] Braun hit the eighth-most home runs by any major leaguer 
through his first four seasons (128).[125] He also became the fifth player 
in major league history to hit at least 125 homers with a .300 average 
over his first four seasons.[126] His 94 home runs in 2008–10 were the 
most by any right-handed outfielder.[127] He was the first player in Brewers 
history to hit 20 or more home runs in each of his first four seasons, 
and the third Brewer to have 100 or more RBIs in three consecutive seasons.[128][129] 
He also became the second player in Brewers history to have consecutive 
100-RBI, 100-run seasons.[130] Braun was awarded the 2010 NL Outfielder 
Silver Slugger Award, winning it for the third year in a row.[131] He became 
the second Brewer to win a Silver Slugger Award in three consecutive years.[131] 
Robin Yount is the only other Brewer to have won the award three times 
(1980, 1982, and 1989).[131] Braun was also voted to the 2010 NL Sporting 
News All Star Team, making the team for the third year in a row.[132] In 
2011, Braun was again named to Sporting News' list of the 50 greatest current 
players in baseball, ranking No. 16. A panel of 21 MLB executives was polled 
to arrive at the list.[118][133] He was named NL Player of the Month for 
April, after tying for the NL lead in home runs (10) and runs scored (24), 
while setting a new team record by reaching base in 28 consecutive games 
to start a season (erasing Yount's record of 23 games, set in 1983). He 
was also named NL Player of the Week, for the week ended April 25.[134] 
He led all National League players in All Star balloting, with an NL-record 
5.93 million votes, as he garnered more votes than any other NL outfielder 
for the fourth year in a row. He was voted an NL All Star starter for a 
franchise record fourth time.[135][136] Braun had a 23-game hitting streak, 
the third-longest in team history.[135] On August 31, he hit a ball deep 
to left-center field and tried for an inside-the-park home run, but fell 
on his way to home plate and was tagged out. The crowd gave him a standing 
ovation for his effort.[137] On September 23, Braun hit a three-run, 450-foot 
home run that sealed the Brewers' NL-Central-clinching victory.[138] He 
was named the NL Player of the Month for the fourth time in his career 
in September, after tying for second in the league with 8 home runs and 
22 RBIs, while batting .330.[139] In 2011, Braun led the National League 
in slugging percentage (.597), OPS (.994), and extra base hits (77). He 
was 2nd in the NL in batting average (.332), runs (109), and total bases 
(336), 4th in RBIs (111) and doubles (38; tied), 5th in on-base percentage 
(.397) and hits (187), 6th in home runs (33; T), and 7th in stolen bases 
(33; a career high).[136][140][141] On defense, he led all major league 
left fielders in fielding percentage, at .996.[142] Braun became the 7th 
player to have at least four 30-homer, 100-RBI seasons in his first five 
years.[143] He also became the 11th major leaguer to hit at least 30 home 
runs in four of his first five seasons.[143] In 2011, Braun became the 
second Brewer (and 56th player in MLB history) to join the 30–30 club.[143][144] 
He was also the second player in Brewers' history to have two 20-steals/20-homers 
seasons.[145] He became the first Brewer to post three 100-run, 100-RBI 
seasons.[146] In addition, he became one of three Brewers who have had 
four 100-RBI seasons.[146] Through 2011, he was third among active ballplayers 
in career slugging percentage (.563), behind Pujols and Alex Rodriguez, 
and first among left fielders in career fielding percentage (.994).[147][148][149] 
He was also the Brewers' all-time leader in career batting average (.312), 
slugging percentage, and OPS (.933), and fourth in on-base percentage (.371).[43] 
In the 2011 playoffs, through October 14 Braun set the major league postseason 
record by reaching base in the first inning in nine consecutive playoff 
games.[150] He also tied Yount and Molitor for the Brewers' team record 
with his 22nd career postseason hit, and tied Charlie Moore for team's 
longest postseason hitting streak, at 7 games.[150][151] In the postseason 
he led the Brewers with a .405 batting average, while driving in a team-best 
10 RBIs.[136] Braun was awarded the 2011 NL Outfielder Silver Slugger Award, 
winning it for the fourth year in a row.[152] That set a Brewers team record, 
and he became the fourth NL outfielder to win the award four years in a 
row.[152] He was named the team's 2011 MVP in unanimous voting by the Milwaukee 
chapter of the BBWAA.[136] On November 22, Braun was named the NL MVP award 
winner for the 2011 season, receiving 20 of 32 first place votes.[153] 
On April 30, 2012, he became the first player to hit 3 home runs in one 
game at Petco Park. Braun was named to his fifth consecutive NL All-Star 
team as a reserve outfielder. It marked Braun's fifth All-Star honor, tying 
him with Cecil Cooper and Paul Molitor for the most in Brewers franchise 
history. On July 20, Braun had his 1,000th career hit. He accomplished 
the feat in his 815th game, sooner in his career than Pete Rose, the all-time 
hits leader, who did it in his 831st game.[citation needed] On September 
16, Braun hit his 200th career home run, against the New York Mets. In 
his following at bat, Braun hit another home run, his 40th of the year, 
the first time he had reached the 40-home-run mark.[citation needed] In 
2012, Braun led the National League in home runs (41), runs scored (108), 
total bases (356), and power-speed number (34.6), and led the league in 
OPS (.987) and extra-base hits (80) for the second consecutive year. He 
was 2nd in the NL in RBIs (112), slugging percentage (.595), and hits (191), 
3rd in batting average (.319), 4th in on-base percentage (.391), and 9th 
in stolen bases (30).[154] On defense, he led all NL left fielders in putouts 
(276) and in range factor/game (1.87).[154] By driving in more than 100 
runs in 2012 for the fifth consecutive year, Braun became the first player 
in Brewers history to have five 100-RBI seasons. Cecil Cooper and Prince 
Fielder each drove in 100 runs four times.[155] Braun became the ninth 
player in major league history to have a season of 40 home runs and 30 
stolen bases.[156] Braun was awarded the 2012 NL Outfielder Silver Slugger 
Award, winning it for the fifth year in a row.[157] His five consecutive 
awards are the longest active streak in the major leagues.[157] Braun finished 
second in National League MVP voting for 2012, behind Buster Posey. In 
2013, Braun played in 61 games with a .298 batting average including 14 
doubles, 9 home runs, and 38 RBIs in 225 at-bats. On July 22, 2013, Braun 
was suspended without pay for the remainder of the season for violations 
of the Basic Agreement and its Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program.[158] 
After the Brewers traded right fielder Norichika Aoki to the Royals for 
pitcher Will Smith, Braun moved to right field to open a spot for Khris 
Davis to play left field.[159][160] In 2014, Braun batted a career-low 
.266, with 19 home runs while leading the Brewers with 81 RBIs and tying 
for the team lead with 6 triples.[160][161] He finished the season with 
230 career home runs, tied with Prince Fielder for second on the all-time 
Brewers list, trailing only Robin Yount (251), and during the season he 
tied Brewers records with 3 home runs and 7 RBIs in one game.[160] He also 
became the 12th player to appear in 1,000 games with the Brewers.[160] 
Braun underwent surgery in October to desensitize the pain receptors near 
the nerves at the base of his right thumb. The problem was affecting his 
grip on the bat.[162] The surgery was performed by Dr. Vernon Williams.[160] 
Through 2014, he was fifth among all active ballplayers in career slugging 
percentage, and second among active left fielders in career fielding percentage.[161] 
In 2015, Braun was named to the All Star Team representing the National 
League.[163] It was the sixth time he was selected as an All Star, a team 
record, surpassing the prior record shared with Cecil Cooper and Paul Molitor.[164] 
On August 19, Braun hit his 252nd career homerun during a game against 
the Miami Marlins setting the record as All-Time Home Run leader in Milwaukee 
Brewers franchise history.[165] The record was previously held by Robin 
Yount. On December 10, 2011, a confidential urine test conducted in October 
2011 was leaked to ESPN's Outside the Lines.[166][167][168][169] They reported 
that Braun had tested positive for an elevated level of testosterone caused 
by a performance-enhancing drug and faced a 50-game suspension. The Daily 
News quoted a source who said that the test results were "insanely high, 
the highest ever for anyone who has ever taken a test, twice the level 
of the highest test ever taken".[170] A second test conducted by an independent 
laboratory showed normal testosterone levels.[171] Braun appealed the positive 
drug test in January 2012, and a three-member panel overturned the results 
on a 2-to-1 vote on February 22, 2012.[172] It was the first time that 
a MLB player had successfully challenged a drug test result.[173] The arbitration 
panel, consisting of MLB representative Rob Manfred, players' union lawyer 
Michael Weiner, and Shyam Das, determined that Braun had raised valid questions 
about the manner in which test collector Dino Laurenzi, Jr. had handled 
his sample.[174] The New York Times wrote that Braun "won on a technicality".[175] 
Braun's sample was collected and sealed on a Saturday. Laurenzi said that 
no FedEx delivery center was open, and he subsequently followed established 
protocol and stored the samples in a Rubbermaid container; he dropped the 
samples off to an open FedEx center on Monday.[171] Braun, though, said 
there were at least five FedEx locations within 5 miles that were open 
until 9 p.m. and there also was a 24-hour location.[176] MLB argued that 
there was no evidence of tampering of the sample, and the United States 
Anti-Doping Agency said the testosterone levels in the samples would not 
grow in a refrigerator over a weekend.[171] MLB's drug-testing program 
states that the samples should be sent to the laboratory on the same day 
they are collected "absent unusual circumstance".[171] In February 2013, 
Yahoo! Sports reported that Braun's name appeared three times in records 
of Biogenesis of America, a Coral Gables clinic alleged to have distributed 
performance-enhancing drugs to a number of Major League Baseball players 
who tested positive for banned substances.[177] One entry noted that Braun 
owed the clinic between $20,000 and $30,000.[177] Braun's name was not 
listed next to any specific PEDs, unlike some of the other players mentioned 
in the records.[177] Braun released a statement maintaining that his attorneys 
had retained the clinic's operator, Anthony Bosch, as a consultant during 
his appeal of his positive drug test the previous season, and denied any 
further dealings with the clinic.[177] Later that month, ESPN's Outside 
the Lines obtained a new Biogenesis document from April 2012 listing Braun 
among three other MLB players with the notation: "MLB Ryan Braun + 1500."[178] 
An ESPN source said to be familiar with Bosch's operation claimed the list 
was of players who obtained PEDs from Bosch and their respective balances, 
with a circle around the plus sign next to a player's name indicating his 
balance was paid off.[178] In late April, Bosch confirmed to ESPN that 
Braun's legal team merely consulted with him during Braun's appeal, and 
confirmed that he never spoke to Braun himself.[179] On June 4, 2013, ESPN 
reported that MLB was preparing suspensions for players linked to using 
PEDs provided by Biogenesis of America, and its founder, Anthony Bosch. 
ESPN reported that Braun could have been suspended for as many as 100 games 
if found guilty, although the appeals process could take months and not 
yield a suspension until 2014.[180] On July 22, 2013, MLB suspended Braun 
for the remaining 65 games of the regular season, plus the entire postseason, 
for his involvement with the Biogenesis clinic. Braun, who lost $3.25 million 
as a result, did not appeal the suspension. In a statement, he said, "I 
realize now that I have made some mistakes. I am willing to accept the 
consequences of those actions." ESPN reported that Braun decided to "strike 
a deal" with MLB after being presented with the evidence against him.[181] 
Called a "liar", he was heavily criticized by the media and other players, 
particularly for tarnishing Laurenzi's reputation.[182][183] In particular, 
it was later exposed that Braun engaged in a campaign for support from 
players around the league, accusing Laurenzi Jr. of being an anti-Semite.[184][185] 
Although the standard suspension for a first offense under MLB's drug policy 
is 50 games, Braun was suspended an additional 15 games for his actions 
during and after his appeal of the 2011 test. According to the Milwaukee 
Journal-Sentinel, MLB officials were particularly angered by a speech Braun 
made during 2012 spring training in which he attacked Laurenzi's integrity 
and the integrity of the drug program as a whole. MLB considered Braun's 
speech, as well as his earlier attacks on Laurenzi, to be conduct detrimental 
to baseball—an offense punishable under the collective bargaining agreement, 
not the drug policy. Braun accepted the additional suspension without appeal 
because of overwhelming evidence in the Biogenesis case.[186] On August 
22, Braun released a statement in which he apologized for using PEDs.[187] 
He admitted he used PED's during the later part of the 2011 season to nurse 
a nagging injury. The products he used were a cream and a lozenge that 
would expedite his rehabilitation. On August 17, 2013, Braun was sued for 
fraud and defamation by Ralph Sasson, a former close friend with whom Braun 
attended middle school, high school, and college at the University of Miami. 
In the lawsuit, Sasson, who claims to be a law student, alleges that he 
assisted Braun in his original arbitration resulting from a positive drug 
test in 2011 and that afterwards, Braun refused to pay him. Sasson also 
alleges that Braun's use of performance-enhancing drugs dates back to Braun's 
days at the University of Miami.[188] After filing the suit, Braun's attorneys 
attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed, but in January 2014, a Milwaukee 
County judge refused to dismiss the lawsuit.[189] In June 2014, the lawsuit 
was dismissed by presiding Judge Paul R. Van Grunsven citing Sasson's "egregious" 
misconduct and bad faith throughout the pre-trial process.[190] In January 
2014, the judge granted a motion to seal the entire case and ordered Sasson 
to not speak about the case in any respect whatsoever.[190] After the case 
was dismissed, Sasson posted a portion of his own videotaped deposition 
on YouTube. Sasson's actions prompted Braun and his attorneys to motion 
the court to have Sasson held in contempt.[191] On July 23, 2014, Sasson 
was arrested outside of the courtroom after a hearing on Braun's contempt 
motion.[192] Roughly 3 weeks later, the Milwaukee County District Attorney 
notified Sasson that no contempt charges would be filed as Sasson's YouTube 
posting was not in violation of any law or valid court order.[193] Sasson 
has appealed the decision to dismiss the case.[194] On appeal, Sasson argued 
that he never acted in bad faith and never violated the seal order; that 
the seal order violated his First Amendment rights by placing "prior restraints" 
on his "pure speech"; and that the seal order was "instituted in violation 
of Sasson's due process."[195] Braun responded by arguing that Sasson waived 
his First Amendment right to free speech and his Fourteenth Amendment right 
to due process.[196] In June 2015 the appeals court ruled that the dismissal 
was properly exercised due to the fact that Sasson had never provided evidence 
that Braun had made disparaging remarks in writing.[197] "He looks like 
'The Natural.'"[198] Braun has the ability to hit for average and significant 
power. His fluid swing is compact and short, with tremendous bat speed 
and a protracted follow-through.[199][200] Braun waits well on offspeed 
pitches, and uses the entire field.[201] He drives the ball, no matter 
where it is in the strike zone.[202] Brewers hitting coach Jim Skaalen 
observed: "He's got tremendously quick hands and really hits through the 
ball. He stays on the ball as well as anyone we've got."[46][200] In addition, 
his speed garnered him comparisons to New York Yankees third baseman Alex 
Rodriguez.[203] Braun has been timed at 4.2 seconds to first base from 
the right side of the plate.[204] In spring training in 2007, he was second-fastest 
in the Brewers' 60-yard dash.[205] A shortstop most of his life and in 
college, Braun was inconsistent on defense after switching to third base 
in 2006.[8] However, he was noted for his athleticism, his occasional web 
gems,[46] and particularly for his powerful throwing arm,[202] which was 
rated the best infield arm in the Brewers' minor league system by Baseball 
America in early 2007.[206] Braun was charged with 34 errors in 2006, the 
majority on throws. "It's a matter of proper footwork", said Ash in early 
2007. "Most of his problems come because he relies on his arm, which is 
very strong."[207] "I think Braunie's biggest problem is reading the ball 
off the bat. He's gotten a lot better on the routine plays, has gotten 
a lot better with his throws. He's a very good athlete. He's working very 
hard at it. He's going to get better, no doubt about it. He hasn't played 
a lot of third base. We tend to forget that."[46] While Yost removed Braun 
from a number of games in September 2007 for defense, he praised Braun 
for his improvements.[208] "The great thing about it is it doesn't involve 
throwing at all now", said Yost, referring to Braun's biggest issue in 
the spring. "It involves first-step quickness to the ball, which will increase 
his range. [He needs to] soften his hands a little bit. [His] hand-eye 
coordination to the ball needs to be a little better. That comes with repetition, 
repetition, repetition." Braun finished 2007 last of all eligible third 
basemen in fielding percentage (.895, with 26 errors; only the fourth third 
baseman since 1916 to play 100 games or more in a season and have a fielding 
percentage under .900),[209] range factor (2.11), and zone rating (.697). 
His target at first base was Prince Fielder, who finished 2007 last of 
all eligible major league first basemen in range factor (8.49), and first 
in errors (14).[210] Similarly, his target at second base, Rickie Weeks, 
had the lowest fielding percentage of all NL second basemen (.976), and 
the lowest zone rating among all major league second basemen (.737).[211] 
It was suggested that it was possible that Braun would learn to play the 
position adequately, given that David Wright (who tied for the major league 
lead in errors by a third baseman in 2005, his second in the league)[212] 
in 2007 became a "passable defender" (and won the NL Gold Glove at third 
base).[213] Braun, for his part, noted after the 2007 season: "It's only 
my second full (professional) year of playing third base. I don't expect 
to be perfect, but I certainly expect to be better than I have been. I 
have to continue to work hard, and hopefully I'll improve."[46] In January 
2008, however, the Brewers acquired three-time Gold Glove-winning center 
fielder Mike Cameron, prompting the team to move center fielder Bill Hall 
to third base and Braun to left field. Before the news broke, Braun was 
taking ground balls at Pepperdine University near Los Angeles. General 
Manager Doug Melvin left him a voicemail, and after returning the call 
and learning of the team's plans Braun grabbed his outfield glove, and 
started taking fly balls. Braun supported the switch. "[The outfield glove] 
is not broken in yet, but it will get there. I feel like I'm a good enough 
athlete and have a good enough work ethic to make the transition pretty 
easily."[214] While Braun's outfield experience until then had consisted 
of "two games in center field my freshman year in high school,"[215] Braun 
had speed, arm strength that would make him stand out against other left 
fielders, and athleticism to make the transition.[216] Early reports were 
good, as in spring training in 2008 he showed an ability to cover ground, 
go back on the ball, to his left into the gap, and to his right to cut 
off balls down the line.[25] Braun looked good tracking liners and high 
fly balls, and took good routes when cutting off balls down the line or 
in the gap, holding batters to singles.[217] In March 2008 Manager Ned 
Yost said that Braun has been "spectacular" in left,[218] and "he's got 
an opportunity one day to win a Gold Glove in left field. He certainly 
does."[219] In July, by which time Braun was being mentioned in the press 
as a Gold Glove candidate, Ed Sedar, the Brewers' outfield defense expert, 
said: "He probably has the best arm in baseball in left field. He can cover 
more ground than 90% of the outfielders out there."[220] In 2008, Braun 
led all major league outfielders with a 1.000 fielding percentage. He also 
led all NL left fielders in putouts (275), and was second in the league 
in range factor (1.95) and fourth in assists (9), in 1,310.1 innings.[221] 
On May 23, 2009, Braun was charged with his first error ever in 190 games 
in left field, when his throw to third was not caught by either Bill Hall 
or Craig Counsell, one of whom should have caught it according to Manager 
Ken Macha, but both of whom were confused as to who was covering the base.[222][223] 
In July 2009, ESPN's Jon Heyman wrote that Braun had "become a terrific 
left fielder in no time".[224] Braun led all NL left fielders in 2009 with 
a .994 fielding percentage. He also led them in putouts (304) and range 
factor (2.06), was tied for the lead in double plays (2), and was third 
in assists (8), in 1,364 innings.[225] In 2010, Braun led NL left fielders 
in putouts for the third year in a row (279), was second in range factor 
per game (1.86), and 4th in assists (6).[124] In 2014, Braun moved to right 
field for the Brewers after right fielder Norichika Aoki was traded to 
the Royals, opening a spot for Khris Davis to play left field. In 2016, 
Braun moved back to left field. Braun's father Joe, most of whose side 
of the family was murdered in the Holocaust, was born in Israel.[226][227] 
His father immigrated to the United States at age seven.[228] His father 
is Jewish and his mother Diane is Catholic.[227][228][229] Braun said "I 
am Jewish", and "I'm extremely proud to be a role model for young Jewish 
kids."[227][228] "It's something I'm really proud of. But I don't want 
to make it into something more than what it is. I didn't have a Bar Mitzvah.... 
I didn't celebrate the holidays."[229] He reiterated: "It's something that 
draws a lot of interest and something I take pride in."[230][231] Braun's 
mother, however, said he is not Jewish.[232] Braun's nickname "The Hebrew 
Hammer",[230][233][234] which was also a nickname for former All-Stars 
Al Rosen[235] and Hank Greenberg,[236] refers to his Jewish heritage. It 
is also the nickname of former teammate Gabe Kapler and alludes to former 
Milwaukee star Hank Aaron (whose nickname was "Hammerin' Hank"), and the 
movie The Hebrew Hammer, starring Adam Goldberg.[237] In response to the 
nickname, Braun's mother reiterated, "He's totally not Jewish. I heard 
some organization started called him ‘The Hebrew Hammer.’ I said, ‘Oh no.’ 
My mother would be rolling over in her grave if she heard that."[232] Braun 
is one of the highest-drafted Jewish ballplayers in the history of professional 
baseball. The New York Yankees made Ron Blomberg the number one pick in 
the 1967 draft.[8] Braun was considered the best Jewish minor league baseball 
prospect in 2006,[238] and became major league baseball's first Jewish 
Rookie of the Year the following season.[239][240] In each of 2007 and 
2008, Braun hit more home runs (34 and 37) than all but 3 of the top 10 
career Jewish home run hitters had hit in their best seasons. Only Hank 
Greenberg (58), Shawn Green (49), and Al Rosen (43) hit more in a single 
year. Through the 2012 season, he was 2nd on the all-time career list in 
batting average (behind Hank Greenberg), tied for 3rd in home runs (with 
Sid Gordon; behind Hank Greenberg and Shawn Green), 7th on the RBI list 
(behind Al Rosen), and 8th in hits (behind Mike Lieberthal), for Jewish 
major leaguers.[241] "Braun" was, coincidentally, the family name of Sandy 
Koufax, until his mother remarried and he took his stepfather's name. "There's 
no [family] connection that I know of", Braun said, "but it's kind of cool."[230] 
In another coincidence, Braun lived for a time with his maternal grandfather 
in a house that previously belonged to Jewish Hall of Fame first baseman 
Hank Greenberg.[228] Braun's grandfather has lived in the house for over 
40 years.[8] In December 2007, Braun was the only Jewish athlete invited 
by President George W. Bush to the annual Hanukkah Dinner at the White 
House, where he talked baseball with the President.[70][242] Braun was 
later featured in the 2008 Hank Greenberg 75th Anniversary edition of Jewish 
Major Leaguers Baseball Cards, published in affiliation with Fleer Trading 
Cards and the American Jewish Historical Society, commemorating the Jewish 
Major Leaguers from 1871 through 2008.[240] Braun was one of three Jewish 
players in the 2008 All-Star Game and one of three Jewish players on the 
Team USA 2009 World Baseball Classic team.[243][244] He and Feldman were 
voted the 2009 co-Jewish MVP by Jewish Major Leaguers, and he was voted 
the 2010 Jewish MVP as Breslow received the Most Valuable Jewish Pitcher 
honors.[245][246] "There aren't too many Jewish athletes at the highest 
level", said Braun. "It's something that I certainly embrace."[247][248] 
Braun was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame 
in January 2010.[249][250] The Jewish Daily Forward listed him as number 
five in the 2011 "Forward 50", its list of the 50 most significant American 
Jews.[251] In 2011, Braun became the fourth self-identifying Jewish player, 
and the first in nearly a half-century, to win the Most Valuable Player 
Award, after Greenberg (1935 and 1940), Rosen (1953), and Koufax (1963). 
In April 2012, Shalom Life ranked him Number 5 on its list of "the 50 most 
talented, intelligent, funny, and gorgeous Jewish men in the world."[252] 
Braun developed his own signature fashion t-shirt line for Affliction Clothing, 
a California-based clothing manufacturer who manufactures shirts that are 
garment dyed and hand distressed.[253] In August 2008, he filmed a YouTube 
video with supermodel Marisa Miller for Remington's ShortCut clippers.[254] 
In October 2008, Apple released a commercial for a new iPhone, that showed 
a clip of Braun's 10th inning walk-off grand slam against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates on September 25, 2008, which kept the Brewers' Wild Card hopes 
alive. Gatorade used the same clip in its November 2008 "League of Clutch" 
commercial.[255] Braun has signed endorsement deals with CytoSport, a supplement 
maker, Nike, Wilson, Mikita Sports for autographs and memorabilia, Sam 
Bat, and AirTran Airways, and is working on his own line of aluminum bats.[70][256] 
He has appeared in commercials for Muscle Milk, Dick's Sporting Goods, 
and regional convenience store chain Kwik Trip.[257] He turned down a request 
by ABC that he appear on the TV show "The Bachelor".[258] In 2010, Braun 
opened two restaurants in Wisconsin, Ryan Braun's Waterfront in Milwaukee's 
Historic Third Ward and Ryan Braun's Tavern & Grill in Lake Geneva.[257] 
In late 2010, Braun's Milwaukee location closed for remodeling and re-opened 
in April 2011 as Ryan Braun's Graffito, an Italian restaurant.[259] In 
July 2012, Braun teamed up with Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers 
to open a restaurant, 8-Twelve, in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Braun lost endorsement 
deals with Kwik Trip and Nike in 2013 after he was suspended for using 
performance-enhancing drugs. In September 2013, SURG Restaurant Group,
