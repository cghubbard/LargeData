The Red Foxes are the athletic teams of Marist College. The Marist Red 
Foxes compete in NCAA Division I athletics as a member of the Metro Atlantic 
Athletic Conference (MAAC) the only exception being football, a member 
of the Pioneer Football League (PFL). The Red Foxes make up 23 varsity 
teams. Separate men's and women's teams are sponsored for basketball, tennis, 
crew, lacrosse, soccer, cross country, track, swimming and diving. Sponsored 
women's teams are softball, volleyball, and water polo. While sponsored 
men's teams are baseball and football. These varsity programs involve more 
than 550 Marist student-athletes. The crew programs are among the few in 
the nation that claim on-campus facilities. The red fox or reynard is indigenous 
to the Hudson Valley where Marist is located and is regarded as highly 
intelligent and cunning. It is the red fox from which Marist's school colors 
of red and white are derived. Marist has been recognized by Sports Illustrated 
as having one of the top 200 college athletic programs in the U.S.[2] The 
Marist athletic department is the biggest and most successful in the MAAC. 
Marist has been awarded the MAAC conference's highest honor, the Commissioner's 
Cup, more than any school in history. The Commissioner's Cup is given annually 
to the most successful MAAC athletic department over the course of the 
year. During the 2013-2014 academic year Marist captured four Metro Atlantic 
Athletic Conference (MAAC) championships and once again earned the MAAC 
Commissioner’s Cup. The Red Foxes extended their conference record of overall 
(men's and women's sports) Commissioner’s Cups to 12.[3] In 2014 for the 
13th straight year Marist led the MAAC with 235 selections to the conference's 
Academic Honor Roll.[4] Marist also had 48 student athletes selected to 
the PFL's Academic Honor Roll.[5] Men's basketball – Siena College, Iona

Many fans and sportswriters refer to this match-up as "The Battle of I-87" 
because of the two-hour proximity of each school on Interstate 87 (Coincidentally, 
the approximate distance between the two is 87.4 miles). Although this 
rivalry exists in all sports, it is most heated during the basketball season. 
During the 1983–1984 season a brawl between the two basketball teams, their 
fans and coaches at McCann put the series on hiatus for three years.[6][7] 
The animosity goes back to when both schools competed at the Division II 
level, then the ECAC Metro Conference and continues today in the MAAC. 
The Marist women's basketball team won 20 games for the first time during 
the 1981-1982 season going 21-10 under head coach Susan Deer. They would 
not reach the 20 win plateau again until the hiring of Brian Giorgis before 
the 2002-2003 season. In Brian's first season Marist would go 20-11, (13-5 
MAAC). Since then, under Brian's guidance, Marist has dominated the MAAC 
with 10 championships and has become a powerhouse on the national stage.[8] 
The first conference crown came in 2004 followed by another one in 2006. 
Although Marist would lose both times in the first round of the NCAA Tournament 
(2004 to Oklahoma and 2006 to Georgia) these games were just building blocks 
for greater successes. In March 2007, after a going 27-5 and making the 
NCAA tournament for the third time in school history, Marist's women's 
basketball team surprised a nation of NCAA fans under the leadership of 
co-captains Alisa Kresge and Nikki Flores, carried by Rachele Fitz. They 
became the third 13th seed to make it to the Sweet 16 since the women's 
tournament expanded to 64 teams. They defeated 4th-seeded Ohio State and 
5th-seeded Middle Tennessee to make it to the Sweet 16.[9] In March 2008, 
the women's basketball team was seeded 7th in the New Orleans Regional 
of the NCAA Basketball Tournament where they defeated the 10th seeded Depaul 
Blue Demons 76–57.[10] They were then defeated by the 2nd seeded LSU Lady 
Tigers 68–49 on March 24, 2008, ending Marist's 22-game winning streak.[11] 
The 2009 and 2010 Women's NCAA Basketball Tournaments saw Marist lose in 
the first rounds to Virginia and Georgetown respectively.[12][13] In the 
2011 NCAA tournament the women's basketball team defeated Iowa State in 
the first round and were thoroughly defeating Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium 
in the 2nd round until Marist's best player Erica Allenspach was injured. 
Duke took the lead late in the 2nd half and prevailed 71-66.[14][15] During 
the 2011-2012 season the Marist women's basketball team won their seventh 
straight MAAC championship by crushing Fairfield in the MAAC Final 61-35.[16] 
They would go on to the NCAA Tournament as a 13 seed and beat 4th seed 
Georgia 76-70.[17] Marist would then lose a tough game in the second round 
66-63 to the 5th seed St. Bonaventure[18] ending another successful season 
for a team that was viewed as Marist's most vulnerable in years.[19] The 
2012-2013 season was the third time in the last six years that Marist would 
go undefeated in MAAC regular season play (18-0).[20] Marist cruised through 
the MAAC tournament and defeated Iona 72-48 in the championship game.[21] 
This was Marist's 9th MAAC title tying St. Peters for the most championships 
in MAAC history.[22] Shortly after winning the 2013 MAAC crown Brian Giorgis 
was named an assistant coach for the USA Women's World University Games 
Team during the 2013 games to be held in Kazan Russia.[23] In the first 
round of the 2013 NCAA Tournament Marist struggled offensively and lost 
a tough first round game to Michigan State 55-47.[24] Marist extended their 
MAAC dominance during the 2013-2014 season winning their 10th overall MAAC 
crown and 9th straight after overcoming a 17-point deficit against Quinnipiac 
University in the conference tournament championship game to win 70-66.[25] 
The game was Marist's 26th MAAC tournament win in a row.[26] Marist was 
defeated 87-65 by their hosts, a red hot shooting Iowa Hawkeyes team who 
shot 12 of 25 from 3-point range and 57 percent from the field, in the 
first round of the 2014 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament.[27] 
Second seeded Marist lost to #1 seed Quinnipiac in the 2015 MAAC Tournament 
Championship Game ending the Red Foxes' nine-year run as champions and 
28 game winning streak in conference tournament games. This was also the 
first time in 35 MAAC tournament games that Marist wasn't the higher seeded 
team.[28] Marist has a large and active rowing program. Marist currently 
hosts both men's and women's heavyweight and lightweight teams all of which 
compete as part of the MAAC. The teams row out of the Marist Boathouse 
on campus and use Longview Park to host races. While the women's teams 
have won 10 conference titles and only finished lower than second once, 
the men's team in particular dominates the MAAC and has won the rowing 
title every year since joining the league, except in 2000 when they finished 
second to Loyola.[29] Each spring Marist competes against the United States 
Military Academy for the President's Cup Trophy. The two teams switch off 
hosting the event each year. West Point's proximity (30 miles south, on 
the opposite shore of the Hudson) and its competitive rowers (despite its 
club team status) has led to an intense rivalry developing over the years. 
The President's Cup Regatta, named in honor of former Marist College President 
Linus Richard Foy has been an annual event for over four decades.[30] In 
October 2009, to celebrate the quadricentennial of Henry Hudson's exploration 
of the Hudson River, Marist hosted a reenactment of the Intercollegiate 
Rowing Association's now defunct Poughkeepsie Regatta at Longview Park.[31] 
From 1895 to 1949 the IRA's national championship race was held in Poughkeepsie 
on the same site that is now Longview Park. The original races started 
off Rogers Point in Hyde Park and ended about a mile south of the Poughkeepsie-Highland 
Railroad Bridge.[31] The top college teams would attend and Poughkeepsie 
was known as the rowing capital of the world.[31] There were about 125,000 
fans along the route in 1929, and 100,000 in 1930.[31] 2009 competitors 
included Marist, Columbia, Cornell, Navy, Pennsylvania, Syracuse, Army, 
and Vassar College.[31] Since 2009 Marist's autumn Poughkeepsie Regatta 
has been held intermittently. Marist routinely participates in the annual 
ECAC championships, the NYSCCA (New York State) rowing championships and 
the IRA national championships. During the summer of 2002 the Marist men's 
varsity eight boat advanced to the semifinals of the Temple Challenge Cup 
at the Henley Royal Regatta.[32] In 2013 the women's program qualified 
for the inaugural NCAA Rowing Championships in Indianapolis.[33][34] Football 
started at Marist as a club sport in 1965 and became a varsity sport in 
1978 as a Division III independent. In 1993 football moved up to Division 
I-AA and in 1994 became the first Marist athletic team to become a member 
of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. Marist plays its home games 
in Tenney Stadium on the main campus in Poughkeepsie, NY. In February 2008, 
Marist joined the Pioneer Football League as its tenth member effective 
for the 2009 season, ending the MAAC Football League.[35] The men's lacrosse 
team has been to two NCAA Tournaments after winning the MAAC lacrosse title 
in 2005 and 2015.[36] In 2005 they would go on to play eventual national 
champion Johns Hopkins in the first round. Marist was soundly defeated 
22-6.[37] In the 2015 tournament #20 Marist bested Bryant University 10-6 
in a first four game.[38] However #2 ranked Syracuse had too much talent 
for the foxes in their first round game winning 20-8.[39] Originating as 
a club sport during the 1970’s, men’s lacrosse subsequently became a NCAA 
Division III varsity sport and by the early 1980’s, began transitioning 
up to Division I. In 1981, the Marist men’s lacrosse team captured the 
Knickerbocker Conference title.[40] The women's team has been to two NCAA 
Tournaments. Losing both times in the first round to Colgate (2008) and 
Maryland (2010).[41] The men's soccer program has qualified for three NCAA 
tournaments (2000, 2004 & 2005) and the women's program once (2011). The 
2004 men's team lost a tough first round game in overtime 2-1 to the University 
of Connecticut.[42] In 2005, the men's team suffered another tough first 
round loss to St. John's University, 3-1.[43] The Marist men's team is 
arguably the most successful program in the conference having advanced 
to play in 11 Division I NCAA Men's Tennis Championships. If not winning 
the conference they have been in the hunt almost every year. The women's 
team also has been moderately successful having advanced to 4 Division 
I NCAA Women's Tennis Championships. The Marist men's and women's programs 
are the most successful programs in MAAC history. The men have won 12 MAAC 
titles (1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007 
and 2008).[44] The women have won 16 MAAC titles (1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 
2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015).[44] 
In addition the men have won two Metropolitan team championships (1990, 
1995) and the women two (1994, 1995).[44] The women have also won two ECAC 
championships (1994, 1995).[44] Marist has had 3 ECAC athletes of the year, 
Brian Bolstad in 2010, Devin O'Nalty in 2008 and Jamie Falco in 2007.[44] 
The Marist athletic department added women's water polo in 2000. They started 
competing in the MAAC after the league began sponsoring the sport In 2003. 
Since then the team has been nationally ranked on several occasions and 
has won 4 MAAC titles (2006, 2008, 2009 & 2010) each of which earned them 
an automatic berth to the NCAA Women's Water Polo Championship Tournament. 
Marist has won three MAAC championships both of which advanced them to 
the NCAA Division I Softball Championship (2006, 2013, & 2016). The James 
J. McCann Recreation Center consists of three major areas and dozens of 
minor ones. The three major areas are the McCann Field House, the Natatorium, 
and the Strength and Conditioning Center.[45] McCann Arena is a 3,200-seat 
multi-purpose arena home to the men's and women's basketball and women's 
volleyball teams. It also hosts special events such as concerts for the 
student population.[46] The natatorium is a 265,000 US gallons (1,000 m3) 
facility, ranging in depth from 4 feet (1.2 m) to 13 feet (4.0 m). It provides 
six 25-yard (23 m) lanes and an independent diving well. The well contains 
two 1-meter and one 3-meter diving board.[47] The Strength and Conditioning 
Center is two floors. The lower floor consists of weight training equipment, 
the upper floor consists of cardiovascular training equipment. All told, 
the facility can easily accommodate 100 students simultaneously.[45] Minor 
areas include two racquetball courts, a 2,200-square-foot (200 m2) dance 
studio, five locker rooms, a classroom, the Pepsi Hall of Fame multi-media 
meeting room, the 2,100-square-foot (200 m2) Dr. Maynard Center for Sports 
Medicine, the Academic Enhancement Center, the 4,200-square-foot (390 m2) 
Coach's Complex, an 11,000-square-foot (1,000 m2) Mondo-surfaced auxiliary 
gymnasium, used heavily by intramurals and club sports, and a student lounge.[45] 
In 2006, a tennis pavilion opened to support the men's and women's tennis 
programs. It features eight lighted, regulation-sized courts, a center 
walkway, and a pergola-covered spectator area. Along with Marist the United 
States Military Academy and the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center 
in Queens, New York, host site of the U.S. Open, are the only tennis venues 
in the area that can boast a Deco II playing surface. Designed by Skidmore, 
Owings and Merrill the pavilion is located on the east campus.[48] The 
pavilion replaced the old tennis courts that were removed in 1994 to make 
room for the construction of the Murray Student Center. The athletic facilities 
with the greatest amount of history in the Marist College Athletic Department 
are the boathouses located on campus, which sit on the banks of the Hudson 
River. It is rare in collegiate rowing to have on-campus rowing facilities. 
Two houses exist: the original Cornell University boathouse once occupied 
by Cornell's crew teams during their annual training and racing at the 
Poughkeepsie Regatta, which was held in Poughkeepsie from the late 19th 
century until 1949, and the newer adjacent Marist boathouse, which stands 
on the former site of the University of California and University of Washington 
boathouses. The Marist boathouse features a boat bay, which contains a 
fleet of 16 top-of-the-line Vespoli shells. Additionally, on the second 
floor are 30 Concept II ergs, free weights, a video viewing lounge and 
a coaching office. The Cornell boathouse was remodeled in 2008, and currently 
is used by the school President for administrative functions, as well as 
housing a few racing shells for the women's team.[49] The 12 acre Longview 
Park is home of the champion Marist men's and women's rowing teams. It 
is where Marist hosts intercollegiate and interscholastic rowing regattas. 
It has a bike/walk path along the Hudson River's east shore, a fishing 
pier, the boathouses, and a gazebo with scenic vistas on a promontory in 
the center of the park. Also known as North Field, the Gartland Athletic 
Field now serves as a core practice facility for Marist intercollegiate 
sports, including soccer, lacrosse, and rugby. It is also a playing field 
for club sports and general recreation. At almost 10 acres (40,000 m2) 
in size, the field is large enough to accommodate three team practices 
simultaneously. The turf is composed of a Kentucky bluegrass, rye and fescue 
mix situated on a sand and organic material base. An irrigation system 
provides 85 sprinkler heads to help maintain this practice location. The 
intercollegiate Softball field, equipped with a state-of-the-art electronic 
score board and newly renovated dugouts, resides in the far corner of North 
field. A practice softball field at the opposite end of the field is used
