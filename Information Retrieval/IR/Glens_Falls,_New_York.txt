Glens Falls is a city in Warren County, New York, United States and is 
the central city of the Glens Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area.[2] The 
population was 14,700 at the 2010 census.[3] The name was given by Colonel 
Johannes Glen, the falls referring to a large waterfall in the Hudson River 
at the southern end of the city.[4] Glens Falls is a city located in the 
southeast corner of Warren County, surrounded by the town of Queensbury 
to the north, east, and west, and by the Hudson River and Saratoga County 
to the south. Glens Falls is known as "Hometown U.S.A.", a title given 
to it by Look Magazine in 1944. The city has also referred to itself in 
the past as the "Empire City."[5] As a halfway point between Fort Edward 
and Fort William Henry, the falls was the site of several battles during 
the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War. The then-hamlet was 
mostly destroyed by fire twice during the latter conflict, forcing the 
Quakers to abandon the settlement until the war ended in 1783. Fire also 
ravaged the village in 1864, 1884, and 1902.[5] The area was originally 
called Chepontuc (Iroquois; "difficult place to get around"), also referred 
to as the "Great Carrying Place," but was renamed "The Corners" by European-American 
settlers.[5] In 1766 it was renamed Wing's Falls for Abraham Wing – the 
leader of the group of Quakers who established the permanent settlement 
– and for the falls on the Hudson River. Wing's claim to the name of the 
falls and the hamlet was transferred to Colonel Johannes Glen of Schenectady 
in 1788, either on collection of a debt, as a result of a game of cards, 
or in exchange for hosting a party for mutual friends, depending on which 
local legend is believed.[4][5][6] Colonel Glen changed the name to "Glen's 
Falls," though it was often printed with varying spelling such as "Glenn's," 
or "Glens". The spelling "Glens Falls" came to be the common usage.[4] 
A post office was established in 1808.[5] Glens Falls became an incorporated 
village in 1839,[5] and was re-incorporated in 1874 and 1887,[citation 
needed] expanding the village to what would become the city limits[7] when 
the city charter was granted by the state legislature in 1908,[7] at which 
time the city became independent from the town of Queensbury. In 2003, 
with permission from Queensbury,[8] Glens Falls annexed approximately 49 
acres (0.20 km2) of the town. The land, known as Veterans Field[9] or the 
Northway Industrial Park, is on Veterans Road between Luzerne Road and 
Sherman Avenue[8] and is just east of I-87.[10] The land was vacant at 
the time.[8] A thin, 0.5 miles (0.80 km) strip of Sherman Avenue[11] was 
part of this annexation,[9] in order to comply with state law regarding 
contiguity of annexed land. Both the city and town share ownership of this 
stretch of highway as a result.[11] Glens Falls has two historic districts 
listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the equivalent New 
York State Register of Historic places. The Fredella Avenue historic district 
includes a series of unique concrete block structures. The Three Squares 
Historic District comprises the majority of the Central Business District.[12] 
In addition, several individual structures are listed, some below. Glens 
Falls does not have a local preservation law protecting these historic 
resources from demolition or alteration. Crandall Public Library – While 
the library has existed since 1893, it did not have its own permanent home 
until 1931, with the completion of the library building in City Park, on 
property willed to the library by local entrepreneur Henry Crandall. The 
building was designed by Charles A. Platt and built by Robert Rheinlander; 
it was renovated and expanded in 1969. Its first renovation and expansion 
since then was completed in November 2008, involving the demolition of 
the 1969 addition.[13][14] The library is a part of the Southern Adirondack 
Library System. Civil War Monument – A limestone obelisk located in the 
intersection of Glen, South, and Bay streets, the monument was dedicated 
in 1872 to honor the 644 men from Queensbury who served in the Civil War. 
Ninety-five names, those of the men who died, are engraved on the monument.[15] 
Many battles of the war are listed. DeLong House – Presently the home of 
the Glens Falls/Queensbury Historical Association and the Chapman Historical 
Museum. A Greek Revival and Second Empire edifice on the corner of Glen 
and Bacon Streets. A Queen Anne style carriage barn is part of the property. 
The Feeder Canal– Across from this historic canal is a hydro-electric power-plant 
on the Hudson River at Glens Falls. The canal was created circa 1820 to 
feed water into the Champlain Canal. During the early 19th century, the 
New York State Canal System was crucial to the development of the state's 
economy. Lime, marble, lumber, and agricultural commodities were shipped 
from Glens Falls from the docks at the base of Canal Street. First Presbyterian 
Church - The congregation was chartered in 1803; its fifth house of worship 
was constructed in 1929. It was designed by Ralph Adams Cram in his "presbyterian 
style" of neo-gothic architecture.[16] Fort Amherst Road – Located near 
this road is the site of the former Fort Amherst. The fort is no longer 
extant, but portions of the wood foundations were known as late as 1880. 
The fort constituted a block house marking the half-way point on the road 
between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry at the head of Lake George. 
This fort system, erected by the British, was built to secure the northern 
territories of the colony from incursions from the French during the French 
and Indian War. A restored fort house complex is available for viewing 
in the nearby town of Fort Ann. Louis Fiske Hyde House – The center among 
a triplet of revival-type residences constructed for the daughters of Samuel 
Pruyn by the architects Robert Rheinlander and Henry Forbes Bigelow, Hyde 
House currently houses The Hyde Collection, a world-class museum of European, 
American, and contemporary art. The principal collection is presented in 
its original domestic context as a private collection. The Oldest Building 
in Glens Falls – In 1864 a massive fire destroyed most of buildings in 
the central business district. The oldest building in Glens Falls, located 
in the downtown area, is one of the few buildings in the city that predates 
1864. The stone and brick structure at the bottom of the hill was erected 
circa 1815 and served as Calvin Robbin's blacksmith shop. Quaker Meeting 
House – The Quaker Meeting House, an Italianate edifice on Ridge Street, 
was built in 1875 and originally contained no heating system. St. Mary-St. 
Alphonsus Regional Catholic School – formerly known as St. Mary's Academy, 
the school is located on the corner of Warren and Church streets. It is 
in the neo-Gothic style of architecture and designed by Ralph Adams Cram. 
The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It 
features a Great Hall with a two-story stained glass window designed by 
Henry Lee Willett Studios of Philadelphia. A New York State historical 
marker referencing American Modernist painter Wilhelmina Weber Furlong 
was placed near City Hall in 2013, during the Warren County Bicentennial. 
Furlong spent about a decade at the end of her life living and teaching 
in Glens Falls.[17][18] According to the United States Census Bureau, the
