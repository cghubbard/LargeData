Wednesday Night Baseball is a live game telecast of Major League Baseball 
that airs every Wednesday night during the regular season on ESPN. The 
game starts at 7pm ET, following SportsCenter, and usually lasts around 
three hours (six counting the Monday Night Baseball game every September 
at the start of the NFL season) with an hour-long Baseball Tonight following 
the game leading up to the 11pm ET SportsCenter (1am ET for September games 
with Baseball Tonight moving to ESPN2 at 12am ET). The official name is 
ESPN Wednesday Night Baseball presented by Exxon and Mobil. Every April 
some broadcasts air on ESPN2 due to ESPN's priority with Wednesday's NBA 
coverage. Wednesday Night Baseball is not exclusive to ESPN. Local sports 
networks may still air the game. ESPNEWS is seen on ESPN during the game 
in the teams' designated markets, unless local broadcasters choose not 
to televise the game. ESPN's blackout (100-mile radius from the stadium, 
and all of a team's designated market) can be lifted in the latter scenario. 
On double-headers in September, due to the broadcast of Monday Night Football, 
either one of the Wednesday Night Baseball games will co-exist with the 
local markets' carriers and will not always be subject to blackout. A complete 
list of broadcasters, with their period of tenure on the show (beginning 
years of each season shown). The program debuted in 1990, when ESPN first 
acquired MLB rights. From 2000 to 2005, Wednesday night baseball doubleheaders 
usually aired at 7pm ET on ESPN and 10pm ET on ESPN2, though this could 
have changed depending on ESPN's programming schedule. The second part 
of the doubleheader was discontinued after 2005 season, however. Wednesdays 
also included an afternoon game, called ESPN DayGame which aired typically 
at 12:30pm or 1pm ET on ESPN, making Wednesdays ESPN's primary day of baseball, 
as games aired both in the afternoon and in primetime. However, ESPN DayGame 
was also discontinued following the 2006 season. 1992 Season 1993 Season
