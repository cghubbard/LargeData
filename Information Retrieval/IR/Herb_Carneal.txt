Charles Herbert "Herb" Carneal (May 10, 1923 – April 1, 2007) was an American 
Major League Baseball sportscaster. From 1962 through 2006, he was a play-by-play 
voice of Minnesota Twins radio broadcasts, becoming the lead announcer 
in 1967 after Ray Scott left to work exclusively with CBS. Prior to 1962, 
he was the voice of the Baltimore Orioles, partnering with Ernie Harwell 
from 1957 to 1959, and with Bob Murphy in 1960–1961. His mellow baritone 
voice and laid-back demeanor were well loved by Twins fans. His enduring 
nickname was The Voice of the Twins. Carneal's trademark greeting, "Hi 
everybody", was reminiscent of his down-home style. A Richmond, Virginia 
native, Carneal first broadcast major league games for the Philadelphia 
Athletics and Philadelphia Phillies in 1954. From 1957 to 1961 he was employed 
by the Baltimore Orioles. He also called games on CBS television for the 
Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League in the team's first four 
years of existence (1961–64), and AFL games on NBC in 1965. Carneal's announcing 
career received a significant boost when he took over the Twins broadcasts, 
as it united him with legendary broadcaster Halsey Hall, after whom many 
major league broadcasters have modeled their work. Hall's influence on 
Carneal's career development is legendary. Carneal received the Ford C. 
Frick Award from the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996, and was inducted into 
the Pavek Museum of Broadcasting's Hall of Fame in 2004. He was named Minnesota 
Sportscaster of the Year 20 times by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters 
Association. Beginning in 2002, Carneal scaled back his workload to providing 
play-by-play for half of Minnesota's home games. By 2007, he was scheduled 
to work only 36 games. Until 2007, Carneal worked in partnership with fellow 
radio commentators John Gordon and Dan Gladden. In 2002, Carneal was inducted 
into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. Herb Carneal died on April 1, 2007 
of congestive heart failure.[1] The Twins dedicated their 2007 season to
