Stan Kasten (born February 1, 1952 in Lakewood Township, New Jersey) is 
the former President of the Atlanta Braves and Washington Nationals and 
the current president, and part-owner, of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Kasten 
was a longtime fixture in Atlanta professional sports primarily due to 
his association with Ted Turner. It started in 1979, when at age 27 he 
became the youngest general manager in the National Basketball Association, 
for the Atlanta Hawks. He held this position until 1990, while becoming 
the Hawks' president in 1986. During his lengthy tenure in the Hawks' front 
office, Kasten became the first (and so far the only) NBA executive to 
win back-to-back NBA Executive of the Year awards, accomplishing this feat 
in 1986 & 1987. He was also able to build Atlanta into a perennial playoff 
contender. Led by the Hall of Fame play of superstar Dominique Wilkins, 
Kasten's Hawks achieved four straight 50-win seasons (1986 to 1989) and 
set franchise records in attendance. In the 1990s, he guided Atlanta to 
a stretch of 7 consecutive playoff appearances, including three 50-win 
seasons during the decade.[1] Kasten would also become president of the 
Atlanta Braves in 1986. From 1987 to 2003, the Braves won more games than 
any other team in major league baseball. As president of the Braves, he 
delegated all baseball decisions to Atlanta GM John Schuerholz, who put 
together strong, talented teams that consistently competed for a world 
championship (although only one of them actually won one; see below). The 
Braves of that time, under the stellar managerial leadership of Bobby Cox, 
were centered on a powerful pitching staff which featured Greg Maddux, 
Tom Glavine, Steve Avery and John Smoltz. They also featured All-Star third 
baseman Chipper Jones, who is regarded as one of the best hitters in Braves' 
history as well as one of the best switch-hitters and third basemen ever. 
From 1991 to 2005, the Braves won 14 straight division titles, 5 National 
League pennants and the World Series championship in 1995 (The 1994 season 
was ended prematurely, without titles or postseason play, cut short by 
the players' strike.) In 1999, when the National Hockey League would award 
an expansion team to Atlanta, Kasten became president of the Atlanta Thrashers 
as well as chairman of the newly built Philips Arena. He held all these 
positions until 2003, when he stepped down, but then assumed the presidency 
of the Washington Nationals in 2006 under the Lerner family ownership group. 
It was reported on September 23, 2010 that Kasten would step down as Nationals' 
team president.[2] In January 2012, Kasten joined Magic Johnson, Peter 
Guber and Guggenheim Partners bidding for ownership of the Los Angeles 
Dodgers baseball team.[3] On March 27 it was reported that the partnership, 
led by Guggenheim controlling partner Mark Walter, had submitted a winning 
bid of $2.15 billion (including surrounding land) -- some 25% above the 
nearest offer.[4] Kasten became team president once the sale closed, on 
April 30, 2012. Kasten graduated from Columbia Law School while living 
in John Jay Hall. He is also a graduate of New York University. He had 
also attended Ner Israel Rabbinical College as a high school student for 
a short time before graduating from the Yeshiva University High School 
for Boys in 1969. He is married to Helen Weisz Kasten, and has four children: 
Alana Kasten Sonenshine, Corey (Reuven) Kasten, Sherry Kasten Marks and
