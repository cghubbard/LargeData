On November 17, 1992, during the 1992–93 offseason, Major League Baseball 
(MLB) held an expansion draft in New York City to allow two expansion teams, 
the Florida Marlins and Colorado Rockies, to build their rosters prior 
to debuting in the National League's (NL) East and the West divisions, 
respectively, in the 1993 MLB season. The 1990 collective bargaining agreement 
between MLB owners and the MLB Players Association allowed the NL to expand 
by two members to match the American League (AL).[1] In June 1991, MLB 
accepted bids of groups from Miami, Florida, and Denver, Colorado, with 
debuts set for 1993.[2][3] The Marlins and Rockies used the expansion draft 
to build their teams using different strategies. As the Rockies had a smaller 
operating budget than the Marlins, the Rockies targeted prospects with 
low salaries, while the Marlins selected older players intended to provide 
more immediate impact.[4] All three rounds of the draft were televised 
by ESPN.[4] As opposed to previous expansion drafts, players from both 
the American League (AL) and National League (NL) were available to the 
expansion clubs.[4] Each existing club could protect 15 players on their 
40-man roster from being drafted and only one player could be drafted from 
each team in each round. At the end of each round, NL teams could protect 
an additional three players and AL teams could protect an additional four. 
To further protect the AL teams, a maximum of eight AL teams could have 
three players chosen.[5] All unprotected MLB and minor league players were 
eligible except those chosen in the amateur drafts of 1991 or 1992 and 
players who were 18 or younger when signed in 1990.[5] Players who were 
free agents after the 1992 season were not eligible for selection in the 
draft.[4] The Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins, however, were not restricted 
in offering contracts to free agents. The Rockies signed their first free 
agent, Andrés Galarraga, to a one-year contract the day before the expansion 
draft.[6] The draft order was determined by a coin toss, the winner of 
which could choose either: (a) the first overall pick in the expansion 
draft and the 28th, and last, pick in the first round of the 1993 MLB amateur 
draft; or (b) allow the other team to pick first and receive both the second 
and third overall expansion draft picks, the right to pick first in the 
subsequent rounds of the expansion draft, and the 27th, and next-to-last, 
overall pick in the 1993 MLB amateur draft. Colorado won the toss and chose 
to pick first overall.[4][5] With the first pick, the Rockies chose David 
Nied, who had a 3–0 win–loss record with a 1.17 earned run average in six 
MLB appearances with the Atlanta Braves.[7] The Marlins' first selection, 
Nigel Wilson, spent the 1992 season with the Double-A Knoxville Smokies 
of the Toronto Blue Jays organization, and had no MLB experience.[8] In 
total, the Rockies and Marlins chose 41 pitchers with their combined 72 
selections.[9] Of the 72 players chosen, 11 were All-Stars during their 
careers. Jack Armstrong,[10] Bryan Harvey,[11] and Danny Jackson[12] had 
been All-Stars before the expansion draft, while Andy Ashby,[13] Brad Ausmus,[14] 
Vinny Castilla,[15] Jeff Conine,[16] Carl Everett,[17] Joe Girardi,[18] 
Harvey,[11] Trevor Hoffman,[19] Jackson,[12] and Eric Young[20] became 
All-Stars later on in their careers. The following trades were announced 
at the conclusion of the expansion draft:[24] Several older star players 
who were left unprotected, including Danny Tartabull, Jack Morris, and 
Shawon Dunston, were not selected due to their high salaries and advanced 
age.[25] Based on the results of the expansion draft, the Marlins were 
projected to have a higher payroll in 1993 than the Rockies.[26] The Rockies' 
payroll appeared to be $4 million, less than what the Marlins would pay 
Bryan Harvey.[25] The New York Yankees challenged the validity of the draft 
on the basis that the Marlins did not compensate the Yankees for the loss 
of territory in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the Yankees had a minor 
league team. They attempted to revoke the assignment of Hayes and Ausmus 
to the Rockies and Everett to the Marlins. Invoking the "best interests 
of baseball" clause, Commissioner Bud Selig and the major league executive 
council affirmed the draft results.[27] In the 1993 Major League Baseball 
season, the Marlins and Rockies both finished sixth out of seven teams 
in their respective divisions.[28] The Rockies were the first team to reach 
the playoffs, using the roster they developed through the expansion draft 
to win the wild card in 1995, a record for the shortest amount of time 
for an expansion team to make the playoffs in any sport.[29] (The Arizona 
Diamondbacks would go on to break the record by reaching the playoffs in 
1999, their second year of existence.)[30] Ritz and Painter, both selected 
in the expansion draft, started Games 1 and 2 of the 1995 National League 
Division Series for the Rockies.[29] The Rockies added free agent acquisition 
Larry Walker to a lineup of power hitters in Galarraga, Bichette, and Castilla, 
known collectively as the "Blake Street Bombers".[31] Meanwhile, the Marlins 
kept fewer players they selected in the expansion draft than the Rockies. 
In 1996, the Rockies retained 13 players from the draft, while the Marlins 
had six.[32] Jeff Conine, nicknamed "Mr. Marlin", was the only player selected 
in the expansion draft on the Marlins' 1997 World Series championship roster.[33] 
However, the Marlins used the players selected in the expansion draft to 
craft their 1997 roster. The Marlins traded three players selected in the 
draft, Hoffman, Martínez and Berumen, to the San Diego Padres for Gary 
Sheffield,[34] a key member of the 1997 Florida Marlins.[35] However, other 
key players to the Marlins' World Series championship were signed as free 
agents.[36] The 1997 Marlins set records by reaching and winning the World 
Series in the team's fifth year[37] (these records were broken by the 2001 
Arizona Diamondbacks, who won the World Series in their fourth year of 
existence)[30] and were the first wild card team to win the World Series.[38]
