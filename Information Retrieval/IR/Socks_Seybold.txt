Ralph Orlando "Socks" Seybold (November 23, 1870 – December 22, 1921) was 
an outfielder in Major League Baseball. He played over parts of nine seasons 
with the Cincinnati Reds and Philadelphia Athletics.[1] Known as a power 
hitter, Seybold set the American League record for home runs in 1902, which 
would not be broken until 1919. He stood at 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m) and weighed 
200 lbs.[2] Seybold was born in Washingtonville, Ohio.[1] He started his 
professional baseball career in 1892, and over the next few years he played 
in the Pennsylvania State League and Atlantic League.[3] In 1896, he had 
a breakout season, hitting .352 at Lancaster, and in 1897, he led the team 
to the pennant[2] by slugging a league-leading 14 home runs.[4] Seybold 
led the Atlantic League in homers again in 1898 and was leading in 1899 
when he was purchased by the Cincinnati Reds.[2] Seybold made his major 
league debut on August 20.[1] He did not hit well in Cincinnati, and returned 
to the minors in 1900. He led the American League in home runs, with 9.[5] 
Seybold then got his second shot in the majors in 1901, with the Philadelphia 
Athletics, and this time, he stuck. That season, he hit .334 and had a 
27-game hitting streak in July and August.[2] In 1902, Seybold batted .316 
and set career-highs in home runs, with 16, and runs batted in, with 97.[1] 
The home run total led the league and stood as the AL record until Babe 
Ruth broke it in 1919.[6][7] The Athletics also won the pennant. In 1903, 
Seybold's batting average dipped below .300; however, his OPS+ stayed at 
exactly 138, and he ripped a league-leading 45 doubles.[1] Seybold continued 
his solid hitting from 1904 to 1907. In 1905, he played in his only World 
Series, which the Athletics lost to the New York Giants; Seybold went 2 
for 16 at the plate.[1] In 1908, Seybold tore some ligaments in his leg 
sliding into home in a pre-season game at New Orleans.[8][9] He left the 
team in June 1908 saying, "I feel that I cannot do myself justice. I have 
decided to quit for the season."[9] He later returned to the team, but 
struggled the rest of the year, batting just .215. He played his last major 
league game on October 7, 1908.[1] In December 1908, Philadelphia manager 
Connie Mack announced that he was releasing Seybold.[10] Seybold then played 
and coached in several minor league and industrial teams for a few years.[2] 
In January 1909, he signed a contract to play for the Toledo Mud Hens,[11] 
but injuries continued to slow Seybold during the 1909 season.[12] From 
1910 to 1911, he coached industrial teams in Jeanette. On April 4, 1912, 
he signed with the Richmond Rebels of the United States Baseball League.[13] 
His baseball career ended with the demise of the league in June. At the 
end of July 1919, Babe Ruth equaled Seybold's American League record of 
16 home runs in a season;[14] Ruth went on to hit 29 homers in 1919.[15] 
Seybold was married but had no children. His wife, Wilhelmina "Minnie" 
Heitz, died in 1917.[2] In his later years, Seybold was employed as a steward 
of a social club (Fraternal Order of Eagles) in Jeannette, Pennsylvania.[16] 
In 1921, Seybold was driving a car when it overturned at a sharp curve 
on the Lincoln Highway east of Jeanette;[16] he was killed instantly.[2] 
He left an estate valued at $20,000.[17] Seybold was buried next to his
