Jeffrey Scott Reed (born November 12, 1962 in Joliet, Illinois) is a former 
Major League Baseball catcher who played for the Minnesota Twins (1984–1986), 
Montreal Expos (1987–1988), Cincinnati Reds (1988–1992), San Francisco 
Giants (1993–1995), Colorado Rockies (1996–1998) and Chicago Cubs (1999–2000). 
He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He is currently a coach with 
the Elizabethton Twins. Reed was the Twins' first-round pick (and 12th 
overall) in the 1980 amateur draft. Despite playing for 17 seasons in the 
majors, he was usually relegated to a backup role. Reed rarely appeared 
in more than 100 games per year. He was widely regarded as a solid defensive 
catcher. On February 3, 1987, Reed was traded from the Twins along with 
Neal Heaton, Yorkis Perez and Al Cardwood to the Expos for Jeff Reardon 
and Tom Nieto. On September 16, 1988, Reed, filling in for an injured Bo 
Díaz, caught Tom Browning's perfect game in the Cincinnati Reds' 1-0 victory 
over the Los Angeles Dodgers at Riverfront Stadium. In his autobiography, 
Browning credited Reed as an integral part of the performance: "He did 
a phenomenal job, especially considering what was at stake in the later 
innings." During the late innings of Browning's perfect game, Reed had 
to continually slow down his pitcher. According to Browning's book, Reds 
manager Pete Rose was worried that his pitcher was working too quickly, 
which could lead to an errant pitch. At one point in the game, Reed stood 
up and raised his arms, palms facing out, to signal Browning to slow down. 
Despite his relative anonymity, Reed enjoyed a cult following in the city 
of Scranton, Pennsylvania throughout his career. A group of young baseball 
fans chose Reed as their alternative hero to more popular choices such 
as Don Mattingly or Ken Griffey Jr. The motto of the fan club: "We support 
the role playing Jeff Reed because in life, who among us is truly a superstar, 
and how many of us are the role players?" Reed remains hugely popular in 
Scranton to this day, almost twenty years after his professional career
