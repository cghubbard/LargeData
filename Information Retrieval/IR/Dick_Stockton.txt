Dick Stockton (born November 22, 1942) is an American sportscaster. He 
is currently employed by Fox Sports and Turner Sports as a football, baseball, 
and basketball play-by-play announcer. Stockton was born in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania. He attended Forest Hills High School in Queens, New York, 
graduating in 1960. He went on to college at Syracuse University, where 
he received his degree in political science in 1964. At Syracuse, he was 
sports director at WAER. He was inducted into the WAER Hall of Fame on 
October 12, 2016. In 1965, he began his sportscasting career at local radio 
and television stations in Philadelphia. He became sports director at KDKA-TV 
in Pittsburgh in 1967, and moved to WBZ-TV and WBZ radio in Boston in 1971. 
Three years later, he began calling Boston Celtics telecasts for WBZ, and 
the following year he became the lead announcer for Boston Red Sox games 
on WSBK-TV. Stockton was part of the broadcast crew for NBC Sports' coverage 
of the 1975 World Series, and on television called Carlton Fisk's famous, 
game-winning home run in Game 6[1] of that series. In 2001, he was inducted 
as a broadcaster into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. Stockton has 
been named as one of the top 50 network sportscasters of all time. Stockton 
started freelancing for CBS Sports in the late 1960s, while still doing 
local television at KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh. In 1978 (following a two-year 
stint calling NFL games for NBC), he joined CBS full-time, and from then 
until 1994 covered a variety of sports for that network, including the 
NFL, the NBA (for which Stockton was the lead play-by-play man from 1981 
to 1990), Major League Baseball (with Jim Kaat from 1990 to 1992. Stockton 
was the number #2 play-by-play man behind Jack Buck and Sean McDonough 
in 1992.), college basketball including ten years as a play-by-play broadcaster 
of the NCAA Regional Finals. Stockton also was the host at the famous upset 
of Villanova over Georgetown in 1985. In addition, he was the host of the 
Pan American Games in San Juan in 1979, and covered swimming and diving 
at the Pan American Games in Edmonton and Caracas. Stockton also broadcast 
the World Swimming and Diving Championships in Guayaquil, Ecuador, the 
World Basketball Championships in Cali, Colombia, and the World Figure 
Skating Championships in Helsinki in the first year that CBS acquired the 
rights. When CBS began covering the Winter Olympics, Stockton was assigned 
to cover speed skating in France in 1992 and two years later, he called 
the speed skating events in the 1994 Norway Games including Dan Jansen's 
record-breaking triumph of the 1000 meter gold medal as well as the gold 
medal victories of Bonnie Blair. Stockton left CBS in 1994 for Fox Sports, 
which continues to employ him on NFL and Major League Baseball telecasts. 
From the time he was hired until 2006, he was Fox's second-team announcer 
for NFL games (behind Pat Summerall and later, Joe Buck), working alongside 
Matt Millen then Troy Aikman, Daryl Johnston, and Tony Siragusa. For Fox's 
MLB coverage, he has worked with Eric Karros, Joe Girardi, Mark Grace and 
Tim McCarver and others. He currently works with David Diehl for football 
and Brevin Knight for Fox College Hoops. From 1995 to 2015, Stockton has 
called NBA telecasts for Turner's TNT channel. From 2007 to 2013, Stockton 
called postseason Major League Baseball games on TBS. In 2007, he partnered 
with Ron Darling to call the National League Division Series for the network. 
In 2008, he called the AL Central tiebreaker game with Darling and Harold 
Reynolds, followed by the NLDS with Darling and Tony Gwynn. In 2009, he 
teamed with Bob Brenly to call the NLDS for TBS, and the two have worked 
together for the NLDS every year since until 2014, when TBS began carrying 
only two LDS, rotating between AL/NL each year. (TBS and Fox began splitting 
the LDS from 2014 on). TBS was previously the exclusive home of the LDS 
from 2007 to 2013. Stockton split play-by-play duties during the 2010 regular 
season on TBS with NBA on TNT studio host Ernie Johnson, Jr. and Milwaukee 
Brewers announcer Brian Anderson. In 2011, he partnered with Ron Darling 
and John Smoltz to call Game 5 of National League Division Series between 
the St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies for TBS as his normal 
partner Brenly was away at a family event. From 1993 to 1995, Stockton 
also called local TV broadcasts of the Oakland Athletics. In 2004, he began 
doing part-time local television work for the San Antonio Spurs. Stockton 
commentated on Super Bowl XXXVIII alongside Daryl Johnston and Super Bowl 
XLII alongside Sterling Sharpe on the international feed, provided by the 
NFL Network. This is the feed used by the BBC and certain other English-language 
broadcasters outside North America. Starting in 2010, Dick assumed play-by-play 
duties for Miami Dolphins preseason games on WFOR; he substituted for Jimmy 
Cefalo as play-by-play on the Dolphins' radio call of the team's Monday 
Night Football game against the New England Patriots on October 4, 2010. 
Stockton provides the play-by-play commentary for NFL Fever 2000 alongside 
Matt Millen. For one season in 1972, he and Ken Coleman, fellow Boston 
Red Sox broadcaster, alternated play-by-play duties with Coleman as the 
secondary play-by-play announcer and with Stockton as main play-by-play 
announcer with no color commentators. Stockton is married to Jamie Drinkwater.
