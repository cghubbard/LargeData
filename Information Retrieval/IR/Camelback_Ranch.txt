Camelback Ranch-Glendale is a stadium in Phoenix, Arizona owned and operated 
by the city of Glendale, Arizona. It is the spring training homes of the 
Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago White Sox. The stadium holds 13,000 people. 
Camelback Ranch replaces Holman Stadium in Vero Beach, Florida as the Dodgers' 
spring training home, and Tucson Electric Park in Tucson, Arizona as the 
White Sox spring training home. The park is also home to the Arizona League 
Dodgers, who moved to Camelback Ranch with the Major League team in 2009. 
The Arizona League White Sox play there as of 2014, after the White Sox 
rejoined the Arizona rookie circuit. The stadium name is derived from the 
longstanding name of the property it is built on.[3] Roger Bossard, White 
Sox head groundskeeper, designed and put in all of the fields for the Dodgers 
and the White Sox. During the park's first year, Dodgers fans have noted 
and expressed their dismay at the absence of the Dodger Dog at the ballpark 
concession stands.[4] The following season, Dodger Dogs began to be sold 
at the ballpark. Camelback Ranch opened on March 1, 2009 for the spring 
training home opener between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Chicago White 
Sox. The Dodgers took a 2–0 lead into the top ninth until the White Sox 
came back to defeat them 3–2. (Attendance: 11,280) In 2015, the Dodgers 
drew 147,066 fans to their 15 spring training games at Camelback Ranch 
(an average of just over 9,804 per game), setting a new franchise spring
