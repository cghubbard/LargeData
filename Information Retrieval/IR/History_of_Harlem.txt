Founded in the 17th century as a Dutch outpost, Harlem developed into a 
farming village, a revolutionary battlefield, a resort town, a commuter 
town, a ghetto, and a center of African-American culture. Before the arrival 
of European settlers, the area that would become Harlem (originally Haarlem) 
was inhabited by the Manhattans, a native tribe, who along with other Native 
Americans, most likely Lenape[1] occupied the area on a semi-nomadic basis. 
As many as several hundred farmed the Harlem flatlands.[2] The first European 
settlement in the area was by Hendrick (Henry) de Forest, Isaac de Forest, 
his brother, and their sister Rachel de Forest, Franco-Dutch immigrants 
in 1637.[1] in 1639 Jochem Pietersen Kuyter established the homestead named 
Zedendaal, or Blessed Valley, stretched along the Harlem River from about 
the present 127th Street to 140th Street.[3][4][5] Early European settlers 
were forced to flee to New Amsterdam in lower Manhattan whenever hostilities 
with the natives heated up,[6] and the native population gradually decreased 
amidst conflict with the Dutch.[1] The settlement was named Nieuw Haarlem 
(New Haarlem), after the Dutch city of Haarlem, and was formally incorporated 
in 1660[7] under leadership of Peter Stuyvesant.[8] The Indian trail to 
Harlem's lush bottomland meadows was rebuilt by black laborers of the Dutch 
West India Company,[9] and eventually developed into the Boston Post Road. 
In 1664, the English took control of the New Netherland colony, and English 
colonial Governor Richard Nicolls established the "Harlem Line" as the 
southern border patent line of the village of Nieuw Haarlem (later, the 
village of Harlem) running westward from near modern East 74th Street, 
at the East River.[10][11][12][13] The British also tried to change the 
name of the community to "Lancaster", but the name never stuck,[14] and 
eventually settled down to the Anglicized Harlem. The Dutch took control 
of the area again for one year in 1673.[15] The village grew very slowly 
until the middle 18th century, and it became a resort of sorts for the 
rich of New York City.[16] Only the Morris-Jumel Mansion survives from 
this period. Harlem played an important role in the American Revolution. 
The British had established their base of operations in lower Manhattan, 
and George Washington fortified the area around Harlem to oppose them. 
From Harlem, he could control the land routes to the north, as well as 
traffic on the Harlem River. The New York Provincial Congress met in White 
Plains, as did the convention drafting the constitution for New York State.[17] 
On September 16, 1776, the Battle of Harlem Heights, sometimes referred 
to as the Battle of Harlem or Battle of Harlem Plain, was fought in western 
Harlem around the Hollow Way (now West 125th Street), with conflicts on 
Morningside Heights to the south and Harlem Heights to the north. The American 
troops were outnumbered, 5000 to 2000, and were ill equipped compared to 
their opponents, but outflanked the British and forced them to retreat 
to the area around what is now West 106th Street. It was Washington's first 
American victory.[18] Later that year, the British would avenge this defeat 
by chasing Washington and his troops north, then turning back and burning 
Harlem to the ground.[19] Rebuilding took decades, and infrastructure was 
improved much more slowly than was happening in New York City proper.[20] 
The village remained largely rural through the early 19th century and, 
though the "grid system" of streets, designed downtown, was formally extended 
to Harlem in 1811, it does not seem that anybody expected it would mean 
much. The 1811 report that accompanied the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 
noted that it was "improbable that (for centuries to come) the grounds 
north of the Harlem Flat will be covered with houses."[21][22] Though undeveloped, 
the area was not poor. Harlem was "a synonym for elegant living through 
a good part of the nineteenth century."[22] The village remained largely 
farmland estates, such as [Conrad] Van Keulen's Hook, orig. Otterspoor, 
bordered north of the Mill Creek (now 108th St., orig. Montagne Creek at 
109th St.), which flowed into Harlem Lake, to the farm of Morris Randall, 
northwest on the Harlem River, and westward to the Peter Benson, or Mill 
Farm.[23] This former bowery [of land] was subdivided into twenty-two equal 
plots, of about 6 to 8 acres (32,000 m2) each, of which portions later 
owned by Abraham Storm, including thirty-one acres (east of Fifth Avenue 
between 110th & 125th St.) were sold by Storm's widow Catherine in 1795 
to James Roosevelt (great grandfather of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
1760–1847). This branch of the Roosevelt family subsequently moved to the 
town of Hyde Park, but several of Roosevelt's children remain interred 
in Harlem.[24] As late as 1820, the community had dwindled to 91 families, 
a church, a school, and a library. Wealthy farmers, known as "patroons",[22] 
maintained these country estates largely on the heights overlooking the 
Hudson River. Service connecting the outlays of Harlem with the rest of 
the City of New York (on the southern tip of the island of Manhattan) was 
done via steamboat on the East River, an hour-and-a-half passage, sometimes 
interrupted when the river froze in winter, or else by stagecoach along 
the Boston Post Road, which descended from McGown's Pass (now in Central 
Park) and skirted the salt marshes around 110th Street, to pass through 
Harlem. The New York and Harlem Railroad (now Metro North) was incorporated 
in 1831 to better link the city with Harlem and Westchester County, starting 
at a depot at East 23rd Street, and extending 127 miles (204 km) north 
to a railroad junction in Columbia County at Chatham, New York by 1851. 
Charles Henry Hall, a wealthy lawyer and land speculator, recognized the 
changes that this railroad would make possible in Harlem and began a successful 
program of infrastructure development, building out streets, gas lines, 
sewer lines, and other facilities needed for urban life.[25] Piers were 
also built, enabling Harlem to become an industrial suburb serving New 
York City. The rapid development of infrastructure enabled some to become 
wealthy, and the area became important to politicians, many of whom lived 
in Harlem. New York mayors Cornelius Van Wyck Lawrence and Daniel Tiemann 
both lived in Harlem in this period. For many in New York City, Harlem 
was at this time regarded as a sort of country retreat.[25][26] The village 
had a population of poorer residents as well, including blacks, who came 
north to work in factories or to take advantage of relatively low rents. 
Between 1850 and 1870, many large estates, including Hamilton Grange, the 
estate of Alexander Hamilton, were auctioned off as the fertile soil was 
depleted and crop yields fell. Some of the land became occupied by Irish 
squatters, whose presence further depressed property values.[22] During 
the American Civil War, Harlem saw draft riots, along with the rest of 
the city, but the neighborhood was a significant beneficiary of the economic 
boom that followed the end of the war, starting in 1868. The neighborhood 
continued to serve as a refuge for New Yorkers, but increasingly those 
coming north were poor and Jewish or Italian.[26] Factories, homes, churches, 
and retail buildings were built at great speed.[27] The Panic of 1873 caused 
Harlem property values to drop 80%,[27] and gave the City of New York the 
opportunity to annex the troubled community as far north as 155th Street.[28] 
Recovery came soon, and row houses (as distinct from the previous generation's 
free-standing houses) were being constructed in large numbers by 1876. 
Development accelerated in part in anticipation of elevated railroads, 
which were extended to Harlem in 1880. With the construction of the "els", 
urbanized development occurred very rapidly. Developers anticipated that 
the planned Lexington Avenue subway would ease transportation to lower 
Manhattan. Fearing that new housing regulations would be enacted in 1901, 
they rushed to complete as many new buildings as possible before these 
came into force.[29] Early entrepreneurs had grandiose schemes for Harlem: 
Polo was played at the original Polo Grounds, later to become home of the 
New York Giants baseball team. Oscar Hammerstein I opened the Harlem Opera 
House on East 125th Street in 1889. By 1893, even row houses did not suffice 
to meet the growing population, and large-scale apartment buildings were 
the norm.[30] In that year, Harlem Monthly Magazine wrote that "it is evident 
to the most superficial observer that the centre of fashion, wealth, culture, 
and intelligence, must, in the near future, be found in the ancient and 
honorable village of Harlem." However, also in that year, the construction 
glut and a delay in the building of the subway led to a fall in real estate 
prices which attracted immigrant Eastern Europe Jews and Italians to Harlem 
in accelerating numbers. There had been a Jewish community of 12 in Harlem 
in 1869[31] that grew to a peak of almost 200,000 in about 1915.[32] Presaging 
their resistance to the arrival of blacks, existing landowners tried to 
stop Jews from moving into the neighborhood. At least one rental sign declared 
"Keine Juden und Keine Hunde" (No Jews and no dogs).[33] Italians began 
to arrive in Harlem only a few years after the Jews did. By 1900 there 
were 150,000 Italians in Harlem.[32] Both groups moved particularly into 
East Harlem. The Jewish population of Harlem embraced the City College 
of New York, which moved to Harlem in 1907. In the years after the move, 
90% of the school's students were Jewish,[34] and many of the school's 
most distinguished graduates date from this period. Both the Jewish and 
Italian Mafia emerged in East Harlem and soon expanded their operations 
to the entire neighborhood.[35] West 116th Street between Lenox and 8th 
Avenue became a vice district.[36] The neighborhood also became a major 
center for more conventional entertainment, with 125th Street as a particular 
center for musical theater, vaudeville, and moving pictures.[37] The Jewish 
presence in Harlem was ephemeral, and by 1930, only 5,000 Jews remained. 
As they left, their apartments in East Harlem were increasingly filled 
by Puerto Ricans, who were arriving in large numbers by 1913.[38] Italian 
Harlem lasted longer, and traces of the community lasted into the 1970s 
in the area around Pleasant Avenue. Black residents have been present in 
Harlem continually since the 1630s, and as the neighborhood modernized 
in the late 19th century, they could be found especially in the area around 
125th Street and in the "Negro tenements" on West 130th Street. By 1900, 
tens of thousands lived in Harlem.[40] The mass migration of blacks into 
the area began in 1904, due to another real estate crash, the worsening 
of conditions for blacks elsewhere in the city, and the leadership of black 
real estate entrepreneurs including Phillip Payton, Jr. After the collapse 
of the 1890s, new speculation and construction started up again in 1903 
and the resulting glut of housing led to a crash in values in 1904 and 
1905 that eclipsed the late-19th century slowdown.[29] Landlords could 
not find white renters for their properties, so Philip Payton stepped in 
to bring blacks. His company, the Afro-American Realty Company, has been 
credited with the migration of blacks from their previous neighborhoods,[41] 
the Tenderloin, San Juan Hill (now the site of Lincoln Center), Minetta 
Lane in Greenwich Village and Hell's Kitchen in the west 40s and 50s.[42][43] 
The move to northern Manhattan was driven in part by fears that anti-black 
riots such as those that had occurred in the Tenderloin in 1900[44] and 
in San Juan Hill in 1905[22] might recur. In addition, a number of tenements 
that had been occupied by blacks in the west 30s were destroyed at this 
time to make way for the construction of the original Penn Station. In 
1907, black churches began to move uptown. Several congregations built 
grand new church buildings, including St Philip's on West 134th Street 
just west of Seventh Avenue (the wealthiest church in Harlem), the Abyssinian 
Baptist Church on West 138th Street and St Mark's Methodist Church on Edgecombe 
Avenue. More often churches purchased buildings from white congregations 
of Christians and Jews whose members had left the neighborhood, including 
Metropolitan Baptist Church on West 128th and Seventh Avenue, St James 
Presbyterian Church on West 141st Street, and Mt Olivet Baptist Church 
on Lenox Avenue.[39][45] Only the Catholic Church retained its churches 
in Harlem, with white priests presiding over parishes that retained significant 
numbers of whites until the 1930s.[46] The early 20th-century Great Migration 
of blacks to northern industrial cities was fueled by their desire to leave 
behind the Jim Crow South, seek better jobs and education for their children, 
and escape a culture of lynching violence. During World War I, expanding 
industries recruited black laborers to fill new jobs, thinly staffed after 
the draft began to take young men.[41] So many blacks came that it "threaten[ed] 
the very existence of some of the leading industries of Georgia, Florida, 
Tennessee and Alabama."[47] Many settled in Harlem. In 1910, Central Harlem 
was about 10% black. By 1920, central Harlem was 32.43% black. The 1930 
census showed 70.18% of Central Harlem's residents as black[48] and lived 
as far south as Central Park, at 110th Street.[49] The expansion was fueled 
primarily by an influx of blacks from the southern U.S. states, especially 
Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, who took trains up the 
East Coast. There were also numerous immigrants from the West Indies. As 
blacks moved in, white residents left. Between 1920 and 1930, 118,792 white 
people left the neighborhood and 87,417 blacks arrived. Between 1907 and 
1915,[50] some white residents of Harlem resisted the neighborhood's change, 
especially once the swelling black population pressed west of Lenox Avenue, 
which served as an informal color line until the early 1920s.[41][51] Some 
made pacts not to sell to or rent to blacks.[52] Others tried to buy property 
and evict black tenants, but the Afro-American Realty Company retaliated 
by buying other property and evicting whites. Some even attempted to convince 
banks to deny mortgages to black buyers, but soon gave up those efforts.[53] 
Soon after blacks began to move into Harlem, the community became known 
as "the spiritual home of the Negro protest movement."[54] The NAACP became 
active in Harlem in 1910 and Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement 
Association in 1916. The NAACP chapter there soon grew to be the largest 
in the country. Activist A. Philip Randolph lived in Harlem and published 
the radical magazine The Messenger starting in 1917. It was from Harlem 
that he organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. W. E. B. Du 
Bois lived and published in Harlem in the 1920s, as did James Weldon Johnson 
and Marcus Garvey. Southern Italians and Sicilians, with a moderate number 
of Northern Italians, soon predominated, especially in the area east of 
Lexington Avenue between 96th and 116th Streets and east of Madison Avenue 
between 116th and 125th Streets, with each street featuring people from 
different regions of Italy. The neighborhood became known as "Italian Harlem", 
the Italian American hub of Manhattan; it was the first part of Manhattan 
to be referred to as "Little Italy".[55] The first Italians arrived in 
East Harlem in 1878, from Polla in the province of Salerno, and settled 
in the vicinity of 115th Street.[56] There were many crime syndicates in 
Italian Harlem from the early Black Hand to the bigger and more organized 
Italian gangs that formed the Italian-American Mafia. It was the founding 
location of the Genovese crime family, one of the Five Families that dominated 
organized crime in New York City.[57] In the 1920s and early 1930s, Italian 
Harlem was represented in Congress by future Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, 
and later by Italian-American socialist Vito Marcantonio. The Italian neighborhood 
approached its peak in the 1930s, with over 100,000 Italian-Americans living 
in its crowded, run-down apartment buildings.[58] The 1930 census showed 
that 81 percent of the population of Italian Harlem consisted of first- 
or second-generation Italian Americans. (Somewhat less than the concentration 
of Italian Americans in the Lower East Side's Little Italy with 88 percent; 
Italian Harlem's total population, however, was three times that of Little 
Italy.)[56] Although in certain areas, particularly around Pleasant Avenue, 
Italian Harlem lasted through the 1970s,[59] today most of the former Italian 
population is gone. Most of these predominantly older residents are clustered 
around Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, mainly from 114th to 118th Streets. 
According to the 2000 Census, there were only 1,130 Italian-Americans still 
living in this area.[60] Still, vestiges of the old Italian neighborhood 
remain. The annual Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the "Dancing of 
the Giglio", the first Italian feast in New York City, is still celebrated 
there every year on the second weekend of August by the Giglio Society 
of East Harlem. Italian retail establishments still exist, such as Rao's 
restaurant, started in 1896, and the original Patsy's Pizzeria which opened 
in the 1933. In May 2011, one of the last remaining Italian retail businesses 
in the neighborhood, a barbershop owned by Claudio Caponigro on 116th Street, 
was threatened with closure by a rent increase.[61] Starting around the 
time of the end of World War I, Harlem became associated with the New Negro 
movement, and then the artistic outpouring known as the Harlem Renaissance, 
which extended to poetry, novels, theater, and the visual arts. The growing 
population also supported a rich fabric of organizations and activities 
in the 1920s. Fraternal orders such as the Prince Hall Masons and the Benevolent 
and Protective Order of Elks set up lodges in Harlem, with elaborate buildings 
including auditoriums and large bands. Parades of lodge members decked 
out in uniforms and accompanied by band music were a common sight on Harlem's 
streets, on public holidays, lodge anniversaries, church festivities and 
funerals.[62] The neighborhood's churches housed a range of groups, including 
athletic clubs, choirs and social clubs. A similar range of activities 
could be found at the YMCA on 135th Street and the YWCA on 137th Street. 
The social pages of Harlem's two African-American newspapers, the New York 
Age and the New York Amsterdam News, recorded the meetings, dinners and 
dances of hundreds of small clubs.[63] Soapbox speakers drew crowds on 
Seventh and Lenox Avenues until the 1960s, some offering political oratory, 
with Hubert Harrison the most famous, while others, particularly in the 
late 1920s, sold medicine.[64][65] Harlem also offered a wealth of sporting 
events: the Lincoln Giants played baseball at Olympic Field at 136th and 
Fifth Avenue until 1920, after which residents had to travel to the Catholic 
Protectory Oval in the Bronx; men's and women's basketball teams from local 
athletic clubs played in church gymnasiums, and, as they became more popular, 
at the Manhattan Casino on 155th Street, before giving way to professional 
teams, most famously the Rens, based at the Renaissance Ballroom on Seventh 
Avenue;[66][67] and boxing bouts took place at the Commonwealth Casino 
on East 135th Street (run by white promoters the McMahon brothers). The 
biggest crowds, including many whites, came to see black athletes compete 
against whites.[68][69] It took years for business ownership to reflect 
the new reality. A survey in 1929 found that whites owned and operated 
81.51% of the neighborhood's 10,319 businesses, with beauty parlors making 
up the largest number of black-owned businesses.[70][71] By the late 1960s, 
60% of the businesses in Harlem responding to surveys reported ownership 
by blacks, and an overwhelming fraction of new businesses were black owned 
after that time.[72] Marginalized in the legitimate economy, a small group 
of blacks found success outside the law, running gambling on numbers. Invented 
in 1920 or 1921, numbers had exploded by 1924 into a racket turning over 
tens of millions of dollars every year. That year the New York Age reported 
that there were at least thirty bankers (the name given to someone running 
a numbers game) in Harlem, with many employing between twelve and twenty 
people to collect bets, and Marcellino, the largest banker, employing over 
one hundred. By the late 1920s, Wallace Thurman guessed there were over 
a thousand collectors taking bets from 100,000 clients a day.[73] The most 
successful bankers, who could earn enormous sums of money, were known as 
Kings and Queens. The wealthiest numbers king of all was almost certainly 
the reputed inventor of the game, Casper Holstein. He owned a fleet of 
cars, apartment buildings in Harlem and a home on Long Island, but did 
not have the ostentatious style and lifestyle of many other kings. He, 
and other bankers, gave money to charities and loans to aspiring businessmen 
and needy residents. Holstein's role in the community extended further 
than most of his colleagues, included membership in the Monarch Lodge of 
the Elks, support for Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association, 
philanthropy in his native Virgin Islands, and patronage of the Harlem 
Renaissance.[74][75] Harlem adapted rapidly to the coming of Prohibition, 
and its theaters, nightclubs, and speakeasies became major entertainment 
destinations. Claude McKay would write that Harlem had become "an all white 
picnic ground", and in 1927 Rudolph Fisher published an article titled 
"The Caucasian Storms Harlem".[76] Langston Hughes described this period 
at length, including this passage from his 1940 autobiography, White people 
began to come to Harlem in droves. For several years they packed the expensive 
Cotton Club on Lenox Avenue. But I was never there, because the Cotton 
Club was a Jim Crow club for gangsters and monied whites. They were not 
cordial to Negro patronage, unless you were a celebrity like Bojangles. 
So Harlem Negroes did not like the Cotton Club and never appreciated its 
Jim Crow policy in the very heart of their dark community. Nor did ordinary 
Negroes like the growing influx of whites toward Harlem after sundown, 
flooding the little cabarets and bars where formerly only colored people 
laughed and sang, and where now the strangers were given the best ringside 
tables to sit and stare at the Negro customers—like amusing animals in 
a zoo. In response to the white influx, some blacks operated alternative 
venues in their homes. Called buffet flats, they offered alcohol, music, 
dancing, prostitutes, and, commonly, gambling, and, less often, rooms to 
which a couple could go. Their location in residential buildings, typically 
on cross streets above 140th Street, away from the nightclubs and speakeasies 
on the avenues, offered a degree of privacy from police, and from whites: 
you could only find a buffet flat if you knew the address and apartment 
number, which hosts did not advertise.[77] Puerto Rican and Latin American 
immigration after the First World War[78] established an enclave at the 
western portion of East Harlem – around 110th Street and Lexington Avenue 
– which became known as "Spanish Harlem". The area slowly grew to encompass 
all of East Harlem, including Italian Harlem, as Italians moved out – to 
the Bronx, Brooklyn, upstate New York, and New Jersey – and Hispanics moved 
in during another wave of immigration in the 1940s and 1950s.[79] The newly 
dominant Puerto Rican population, which reached 63,000 in 1950, continued 
to define the neighborhood according to its needs, establishing bodegas 
and botánicas as it expanded; by the 1930s[78] there was already an enclosed 
street market underneath the Park Avenue railroad viaduct between 111th 
and 116th Streets, called "La Marqueta" ("The Market").[79] Catholic and 
evangelistic Protestant churches appeared in storefronts.[79] Although 
"Spanish Harlem" had been in use since at least the 1930s to describe the 
Hispanic enclave – along with "Italian Harlem" and "Negro Harlem"[80] – 
around the 1950s the name began to be used to describe the entire East 
Harlem neighborhood. Later, the name "El Barrio" ("The Neighborhood") began 
to be used, especially by inhabitants of the area. Since the 1920s, this 
period of Harlem's history has been highly romanticized. With the increase 
in a poor population, it was also the time when the neighborhood began 
to deteriorate to a slum, and some of the storied traditions of the Harlem 
Renaissance were driven by poverty, crime, or other social ills. For example, 
in this period, Harlem became known for "rent parties", informal gatherings 
in which bootleg alcohol was served and music played. Neighbors paid to 
attend, and thus enabled the host to make his or her monthly rent. Though 
picturesque, these parties were thrown out of necessity. Further, over 
a quarter of black households in Harlem made their monthly rent by taking 
in lodgers, many of whom were family members, but who sometimes brought 
bad habits or even crime that disrupted the lives of respectable families. 
Lodgers also experienced disruption, with many having to move frequently 
when households relocated, roommates quarreled or they could not pay rent.[81] 
Urban reformers campaigned to eliminate the "lodger evil" but the problem 
got worse before it got better; in 1940, still affected by the Depression, 
40% of black families in Harlem were taking in lodgers.[82] The high rents 
and poor maintenance of housing stock, which Harlem residents suffered 
through much of the 20th century, was not merely the product of racism 
by white landlords. By 1914, 40% of Harlem's private houses and 10% of 
its tenements were owned by blacks.[83] Wealthier blacks continued to purchase 
land in Harlem,[41] and by 1920, a significant portion of the neighborhood 
was owned by blacks.[29][84] By the late 1960s, 60% of the businesses in 
Harlem responding to surveys reported ownership by blacks, and an overwhelming 
fraction of new businesses were black owned after that time.[72] In 1928, 
the first effort at housing reform was attempted in Harlem with the construction 
of the Paul Laurence Dunbar Houses, backed by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. 
These were intended to give working people of modest means the opportunity 
to live in and, over time, purchase, houses of their own. The Great Depression 
hit shortly after the buildings opened, and the experiment failed. They 
were followed in 1936 by the Harlem River Houses, a more modest experiment 
in housing projects.[29] And by 1964, nine giant public housing projects 
had been constructed in the neighborhood, housing over 41,000 people.[85] 
The earliest activism by blacks to change the situation in Harlem itself 
grew out of the Great Depression, with the "Don't Buy Where You Can't Work" 
movement.[86] This was the ultimately successful campaign to force retail 
shops on 125th Street to hire black employees. Boycotts were originally 
organized by the Citizens' League for Fair Play in June 1934 against Blumstein's 
Department Store on 125th Street. The store soon agreed to integrate its 
staff more fully. This success emboldened Harlem residents, and protests 
continued under other leadership, including that of preacher and later 
congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., seeking to change hiring practices 
at other stores, to effect the hiring of more black workers, or the hiring 
of members of particular protesting groups.[87] Communism gained a following 
in Harlem in the 1930s, and continued to play a role through the 1940s.[54] 
In 1935, the first of Harlem's five riots broke out. The incident started 
with a (false) rumor that a boy caught stealing from a store on 125th Street 
had been killed by the police. By the time it was over, 600 stores had 
been looted and three men were dead. The same year saw internationalism 
in Harlem politics, as Harlemites responded to the Italian invasion of 
Ethiopia by holding giant rallies, signing petitions and sending an appeal 
to the League of Nations.[88] Such internationalism continued intermittently, 
including broad demonstrations in favor of Egyptian president Nasser after 
the Suez invasion of 1956.[89] The neighborhood was hit hard by job losses 
in the Great Depression. In the early 1930s, 25% of Harlemites were out 
of work, and employment prospects for Harlemites stayed bad for decades. 
Employment among black New Yorkers fell as some traditionally black businesses, 
including domestic service and some types of manual labor, were taken over 
by other ethnic groups. Major industries left New York City altogether, 
especially after 1950. The job losses of the Depression were exacerbated 
by the end of Prohibition in 1933[90] and by the Harlem Riot of 1935, which 
scared away the wealthier whites who had long supported Harlem's entertainment 
industry.[8] White audiences decreased almost totally after a second round 
of riots in 1943. Many Harlemites found work in the military or in the 
Brooklyn shipyards during World War II,[91] but the neighborhood declined 
rapidly once the war ended. Some middle-class blacks moved north or west 
to suburbs, a trend that increased after the 1960s Civil Rights Movement 
decreased discrimination in housing. The neighborhood enjoyed few benefits 
from the massive public works projects in New York under Robert Moses in 
the 1930s, and as a result had fewer parks and public recreational sites 
than other New York neighborhoods. Of the 255 playgrounds Moses built in 
New York City, he placed only one in Harlem.[92] The earliest activism 
by blacks to change the situation in Harlem itself grew out of the Great 
Depression, with the "Don't Buy Where You Can't Work" movement.[86] This 
was the ultimately successful campaign to force retail shops on 125th Street 
to hire black employees. Boycotts were originally organized by the Citizens' 
League for Fair Play in June 1934 against Blumstein's Department Store 
on 125th Street. The store soon agreed to integrate its staff more fully. 
This success emboldened Harlem residents, and protests continued under 
other leadership, including that of preacher and later congressman Adam 
Clayton Powell, Jr., seeking to change hiring practices at other stores, 
to effect the hiring of more black workers, or the hiring of members of 
particular protesting groups.[87] Communism gained a following in Harlem 
in the 1930s, and continued to play a role through the 1940s.[54] In 1935, 
the first of Harlem's five riots broke out. The incident started with a 
boy that was supposedly caught stealing from a store on 125th Street had 
been killed by the police. By the time it was over, 600 stores had been 
looted and three men were dead. The same year saw internationalism in Harlem 
politics, as Harlemites responded to the Italian invasion of Ethiopia by 
holding giant rallies, signing petitions and sending an appeal to the League 
of Nations.[88] Such internationalism continued intermittently, including 
broad demonstrations in favor of Egyptian president Nasser after the Suez 
invasion of 1956.[93] Black Harlemites took positions in the elected political 
infrastructure of New York starting in 1941 with the election of Adam Clayton 
Powell Jr. to the City Council. He was easily elected to Congress when 
a congressional district was placed in Harlem in 1944, leaving his City 
Council seat to be won by another black Harlemite, Benjamin J. Davis. Ironically, 
Harlem's political strength soon deteriorated, as Clayton Powell, Jr. spent 
his time in Washington or his vacation home in Puerto Rico, and Davis was 
jailed in 1951 for violations of the Smith Act.[94] The year 1943 saw the 
second Harlem riot. A black soldier knocked down a policeman who then shot 
him. An onlooker shouted that the soldier had been killed, and this news 
spread throughout the black community and provoked rioting. A force of 
6,600, made up of city police, military police and civil patrolmen, in 
addition to 8,000 State Guardsmen and 1,500 civilian volunteers was required 
to end the violence. Hundreds of businesses were destroyed and looted, 
the property damage approaching $225,000. Overall, six people died and 
185 were injured. Five hundred people were arrested in connection with 
the riot. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Harlem was the scene of a 
series of rent strikes by neighborhood tenants, led by local activist Jesse 
Gray, together with the Congress of Racial Equality, Harlem Youth Opportunities 
Unlimited (HARYOU), and other groups. These groups wanted the city to force 
landlords to improve the quality of housing by bringing them up to code, 
to take action against rats and roaches, to provide heat during the winter, 
and to keep prices in line with existing rent control regulations. According 
to the Metropolitan Council on Housing, in the mid-1960s, about 25% of 
the city's landlords charged more for rent than allowed by law.[95] Many 
groups mobilized in Harlem in the 1960s, fighting for better schools, jobs, 
and housing. Some were peaceful and others advocated violence. By the early 
1960s, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) had offices on 125th street, 
and acted as negotiator for the community with the city, especially in 
times of racial unrest. They urged civilian review boards to hear complaints 
of police abuse, a demand that was ultimately met. As chairman of the House 
Committee of Education and Labor at the start of the 1960s, Adam Clayton 
Powell Jr. used this position to direct federal funds to various development 
projects in Harlem.[96] The largest public works projects in Harlem in 
these years were public housing, with the largest concentration built in 
East Harlem.[97] Typically, existing structures were torn down and replaced 
with city-designed and managed properties that would, in theory, present 
a safer and more pleasant environment than those available from private 
landlords. Ultimately, community objections halted the construction of 
new projects.[98] From the mid-20th century, the terrible quality of local 
schools has been a source of distress. In the 1960s, about 75% of Harlem 
students tested under grade levels in reading skills, and 80% tested under 
grade level in math.[99] In 1964, residents of Harlem staged two school 
boycotts to call attention to the problem. In central Harlem, 92% of students 
stayed home.[100] The influence of the southern nonviolent protest movement 
was muted in Harlem. Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was the black leader 
most respected in Harlem.[101][102] But on September 20, 1958, Izola Curry, 
deluded into believing the NAACP was controlled by Communists, approached 
Dr. King at a Blumstein's book-signing, and asked him if he was Martin 
Luther King, Jr. When King replied in the affirmative, she said, "I've 
been looking for you for five years", then thrust a letter opener into 
his chest. NYPD officers took King, still in the chair where he had sat, 
to an ambulance that took him to Harlem Hospital, for removal of the blade. 
Reportage recalling the event for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in 2014, 
noted: At least two dozen groups of black nationalists also operated in 
New York, many of them in Harlem. The most important of these was the Nation 
of Islam, whose Temple Number Seven was run by Malcolm X from 1952–1963.[104] 
Malcolm X was assassinated in the Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights 
in 1965. The neighborhood remains an important center for the Nation of 
Islam. In 1963, Inspector Lloyd Sealy became the first African-American 
officer of the NYPD to command a police station, the 28th precinct in Harlem.[105] 
Community relations between Harlem residents and the NYPD were strained 
as civil rights activists requested that the NYPD hire more black police 
officers, specifically in Harlem. In 1964, across Harlem's three precincts, 
the ratio was one black police officer for every six white officers.[106] 
A riot broke in the summer of 1964 following the fatal shooting of an unarmed 
15-year-old black teenager by an off-duty white police lieutenant. One 
person was killed, more than 100 were injured, and hundreds more were arrested. 
Property damage and looting were extensive. The riot would later spread 
out of Manhattan and into the borough of Brooklyn and neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, 
the heart of Brooklyn's African-American community. In the aftermath of 
the riots, the federal government funded a pilot program called Project 
Uplift, in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during 
the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by HARYOU 
called Youth in the Ghetto.[107] HARYOU was given a major role in organizing 
the project, along with the National Urban League and nearly 100 smaller 
community organizations.[108] In 1966, the Black Panthers organized a group 
in Harlem, agitating for violence in pursuit of change. Speaking at a rally 
of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Max Stanford, 
a Black Panther, declared that the United States "could be brought down 
to its knees with a rag and some gasoline and a bottle."[109] In 1968, 
Harlemites rioted after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., as 
did black residents in other U.S. cities. Two people died—one stabbed to 
death in a crowd and another trapped in a burning building. However, the 
rioting in New York was minor compared to that in other American cities.[110] 
Mayor John Lindsay helped to quell the rioting by marching up Lenox Avenue 
in a "hail of bricks" to confront the angry crowds.[111] (See also King 
assassination riots.) Little investment in private homes or businesses 
took place in the neighborhood between 1911 and the 1990s. However, the 
unwillingness of landlords elsewhere in the city to rent to black tenants, 
together with a significant increase in the black population of New York, 
meant that rents in Harlem were for many years higher than rents elsewhere 
in the city, even as the housing stock decayed. In 1920, one-room apartments 
in central Harlem rented for $4000 to whites or $1000–$1205 to blacks.[112] 
In the late 1920s, a typical white working-class family in New York paid 
$600.67 per month per room, while blacks in Harlem paid $900.50 for the 
same space.[113] The worse the accommodations and more desperate the renter, 
the higher the rents would be.[114] This pattern persisted through the 
1960s; in 1965, CERGE reported that a one-room apartment in Harlem rented 
for $50–$74, while comparable apartments rented for $30–$49 in white slums.[115] 
The high rents encouraged some property speculators to engage in block 
busting, a practice whereby they would acquire a single property on a block 
and sell or rent it to blacks with great publicity. Other landowners would 
panic, and the speculators would then buy additional houses relatively 
cheaply.[116] These houses could then be rented profitably to blacks.[117] 
After the Harlem River Houses, America's first federally subsidized housing 
project, were opened in 1937, other massive housing projects soon followed, 
with tens of thousands of units constructed over the next twenty years, 
especially in Harlem.[98] In the post-World War II era, Harlem ceased to 
be home to a majority of the city's blacks,[118] but it remained the cultural 
and political capital of black New York, and possibly black America.[119][120] 
The character of the community changed in the years after the war, as middle-class 
blacks left for the outer boroughs (primarily the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn) 
and suburbs. The percentage of Harlem that was black peaked in 1950, at 
98.2%.[121] Thereafter, Hispanic, Asian, and white residents have increased 
their share. The high cost of space forced people to live in close quarters, 
and the population density of Harlem in these years was stunning—over 215,000 
per square mile in the 1920s. By comparison, in 2000, Manhattan as a whole 
had a population density under 70,000 per square mile.[122] The same forces 
that allowed landlords to charge more for Harlem space also enabled them 
to maintain it less, and many of the residential buildings in Harlem fell 
into disrepair. The 1960 census showed only 51% of housing in Harlem to 
be "sound", as opposed to 85% elsewhere in New York City.[85] In 1968, 
the New York City Buildings Department received 500 complaints daily of 
rats in Harlem buildings, falling plaster, lack of heat, and unsanitary 
plumbing.[22] Tenants were sometimes to blame; some would strip wiring 
and fixtures from their buildings to sell, throw garbage in hallways and 
airshafts, or otherwise damage the properties which they lived in or visited.[123] 
As the building stock decayed, landlords converted many buildings into 
"single room occupancies", or SROs, essentially private homeless shelters. 
In many cases, the income from these buildings could not support the fines 
and city taxes charged to their owners, or the houses suffered damage that 
would have been expensive to fix, and the buildings were abandoned. In 
the 1970s, this process accelerated to the point that Harlem, for the first 
time since before World War I, had a lower population density than the 
rest of Manhattan. Between 1970 and 1980, for example, Frederick Douglass 
Boulevard between 110th Street and 125th Street in central Harlem lost 
42% of its population and 23% of its remaining housing stock.[124] By 1987, 
65% of the buildings in Harlem were owned by the City of New York,[125][126][127] 
and many had become empty shells, convenient centers for drug dealing and 
other illegal activity. The lack of habitable buildings and falling population 
reduced tax rolls and made the neighborhood even less attractive to residential 
and retail investment. Inadequate housing contributed to racial unrest 
and health problems. However, the lack of development also preserved buildings 
from the 1870–1910 building boom, and Harlem as a result has many of the 
finest original townhouses in New York. This includes work by many significant 
architects of the day, including McKim, Mead, and White; James Renwick; 
William Tuthill; Charles Buek; and Francis Kimball. By some measures, the 
1970s were the worst period in Harlem's history. Many of those Harlemites 
who were able to escape from poverty left the neighborhood in search of 
safer streets, better schools and homes. Those who remained were the poorest 
and least skilled, with the fewest opportunities for success. Though the 
federal government's Model Cities Program spent $100 million on job training, 
health care, education, public safety, sanitation, housing, and other projects 
over a ten-year period, Harlem showed no improvement.[128] The deterioration 
shows up starkly in the statistics of the period. In 1968, Harlem's infant 
mortality rate had been 37 for each 1000 live births, as compared to 23.1 
in the city as a whole. Over the next eight years, infant mortality for 
the city as whole improved to 19, while the rate in Harlem increased to 
42.8, more than double. Statistics describing illness, drug addiction, 
housing quality, and education are similarly grim and typically show rapid 
deterioration in the 1970s. The wholesale abandonment of housing was so 
pronounced that between 1976 and 1978 alone, central Harlem lost almost 
a third of its total population, and east Harlem lost about 27%.[128] The 
neighborhood no longer had a functioning economy; stores were shuttered 
and by estimates published in 1971, 60% of the area's economic life depended 
on the cash flow from the illegal "Numbers game" alone.[129] The worst 
part of Harlem was the "Bradhurst section" between Adam Clayton Powell 
Jr. Boulevard and Edgecombe, from 139th Street through 155th. In 1991, 
this region was described in the New York Times as follows: "Since 1970, 
an exodus of residents has left behind the poor, the uneducated, the unemployed. 
Nearly two-thirds of the households have incomes below $10,000 a year. 
In a community with one of the highest crime rates in the city, garbage-strewn 
vacant lots and tumbledown tenements, many of them abandoned and sealed, 
contribute to the sense of danger and desolation that pervades much of 
the area."[130] Plans for rectifying the situation often started with the 
restoration of 125th Street, long the economic heart of black Harlem.[131] 
By the late 1970s, only marginalized and poor retail remained.[132] Plans 
were drafted for a "Harlem International Trade Center", which would have 
filled the entire block between 125th Street and 126th, from Lenox to Adam 
Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, with a center for trade with the third world. 
A related retail complex was planned to the west, between Frederick Douglass 
Boulevard and St. Nicholas. However, this plan depended on $30 million 
in financing from the federal government,[131] and with the election of 
Ronald Reagan to the presidency of the United States, it had no hope of 
being completed.[132] The city did provide one large construction project, 
though not so favored by residents. Starting in the 1960s and continuing 
through the 1970s, Harlemites fought the introduction of an immense sewage 
treatment plant, the North River Water Pollution Control Plant, on the 
Hudson River in West Harlem. A compromise was ultimately reached in which 
the plant was built with a state park, including extensive recreational 
facilities, on top. The park, called Riverbank State Park, was opened in 
1993 (the sewage plant having been completed some years earlier).[133] 
The city began auctioning its enormous portfolio of Harlem properties to 
the public in 1985. This was intended to improve the community by placing 
property in the hands of people who would live in them and maintain them. 
In many cases, the city would even pay to completely renovate a property 
before selling it (by lottery) below market value.[134] The program was 
soon beset by scandal—buyers were acquiring houses from the city, then 
making deals with churches or other charities in which they would inflate 
the appraised values of the properties and the church or charity would 
take out federally guaranteed 203(k) mortgage and buy it. The original 
buyer would realize a profit and the church or charity would default on 
the mortgage (presumably getting some kind of kickback from the developer).[135][136] 
Abandoned shells were left to further deteriorate, and about a third of 
the properties sold by the city were tenements which still had tenants, 
who were left in particularly miserable conditions. These properties, and 
new restrictions on Harlem mortgages, bedeviled the area's residential 
real estate market for years. After four decades of decline, Central Harlem's 
population bottomed out in the 1990 census, at 101,026. It had decreased 
by 57% from its peak of 237,468 in 1950. Between 1990 and 2006 the neighborhood's 
population grew by 16.9%, with the percentage of blacks decreasing from 
87.6% to 69.3%,[49] then dropping to 54.4% by 2010,[137] and the percentage 
of whites increasing from 1.5% to 6.6% by 2006,[49] and to "almost 10%" 
by 2010.[137] From 1987 through 1990, the city removed long-unused trolley 
tracks from 125th Street, laid new water mains and sewers, installed new 
sidewalks, curbs, traffic lights, streetlights, and planted trees. Two 
years later, national chains opened branches on 125th Street for the first 
time – The Body Shop opened a store at 125th street and 5th Avenue (still 
extant As of 2010[update]),and a Ben & Jerry's ice cream franchise employing 
formerly homeless people opened across the street.[138] The development 
of the region would leap forward a few years later with the 1994 introduction 
of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, which brought $300 million in 
development funds and $250 million in tax breaks.[139] Plans were laid 
for shopping malls, movie theaters, and museums. However, these plans were 
nearly derailed in 1995 by the "Freddy's Fashion Mart" riot, which culminated 
in political arson and eight deaths. These riots did not resemble their 
predecessors, and were organized by black activists against Jewish shop 
owners on 125th street.[140] Five years later, the revitalization of 125th 
Street resumed, with the construction of a Starbucks outlet backed in part 
by Magic Johnson (1999), the first supermarket in Harlem in 30 years,[139] 
the Harlem USA retail complex, which included the first first-run movie 
theater in many years (2000),[141] and a new home for the Studio Museum 
in Harlem (2001). In the same year, former president Bill Clinton took 
office space in Harlem, at 55 West 125th Street.[142] In 2002, a large 
retail and office complex called Harlem Center was completed at the corner 
of Lenox and 125th.[139] There has been extensive new construction and 
rehabilitation of older buildings in the years since. After years of false 
starts, Harlem began to see rapid gentrification in the late 1990s. This 
was driven by changing federal and city policies, including fierce crime 
fighting and a concerted effort to develop the retail corridor on 125th 
Street. The number of housing units in Harlem increased by 14% between 
1990 and 2000,[126] and the rate of increase has been much more rapid in 
recent years. Property values in Central Harlem increased nearly 300% during 
the 1990s, while the rest of New York City saw only a 12% increase.[126] 
Even empty shells of buildings in the neighborhood were routinely selling 
for nearly $1,000,000 each as of 2007.[143] In January 2010, The New York 
Times reported that in "Greater Harlem", which they defined as running 
from the East River to the Hudson River, from 96th Street to 155th Street, 
blacks ceased to be a majority of the population in 1998, with the change 
largely attributable to the rapid arrival of new white and Hispanic residents. 
The paper reported that the population of the area had grown more since 
2000 than in any decade since the 1940s.[144] Median housing prices dropped 
farther in Harlem than in the rest of Manhattan during the real estate 
crash of 2008, but recovered more rapidly as well.[145] The neighborhood's 
changes have provoked some discontent. James David Manning, pastor of the 
ATLAH World Missionary Church on Lenox Avenue, has received press for declaring 
a boycott on all Harlem shops, restaurants, other businesses, and churches 
other than his own. He believes that this will cause an economic crash 
that will drive out white residents and drop property values to a level 
his supporters can afford.[146] There have been rallies against gentrification.[147] 
On March 12, 2014, two buildings in East Harlem were destroyed in a gas
