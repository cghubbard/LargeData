As player As manager Adrian Constantine Anson (April 17, 1852 – April 14, 
1922), nicknamed "Cap" (for "Captain") and "Pop", was a Major League Baseball 
(MLB) first baseman. Including his time in the National Association (NA), 
he played a record 27 consecutive seasons.[3] Anson was regarded as one 
of the greatest players of his era and one of the first superstars of the 
game.[4] Anson spent most of his career with the Chicago Cubs franchise 
(then known as the "White Stockings" and later the "Colts"), serving as 
the club's manager, first baseman and, later in his tenure, minority owner. 
He led the team to five National League pennants in the 1880s. Anson was 
one of baseball's first great hitters, and probably the first to tally 
over 3,000 career hits. His contemporary influence and prestige are regarded 
by historians as playing a major role in establishing the racial segregation 
in professional baseball that persisted until the late 1940s.[5] A 2006 
biography of Anson that exhaustively examined 19th-century newspaper reporting 
related to him on the subject of racism reached the following conclusion: 
"As far as the nineteenth century, he rightfully should endure as the big 
leaguer who, until the late 1940s, was involved in the greatest number 
of reported negative incidents, on the field, relating to blacks." On several 
occasions, Anson refused to take the field when the opposing roster included 
black players.[6] The biography states, "But at the same time, his argumentative 
nature could be readily discounted by those around him. So, the notion 
that he had 'coattails' in persuading players and officials on other teams 
to do as he did is rather spurious." A lengthy 2016 essay by the same author 
focused on claims of Anson’s alleged influence on the most noted vote in 
19th-century professional baseball in favor of segregation: a July 14, 
1887 one by the high-minor International League to ban the signing of new 
contracts with black players; the essay showed a range of authors as not 
having observed the line between fact and speculation on that alleged influence.[7] 
After retiring as a player and leaving the Colts, Anson briefly managed 
the New York Giants. He ran several enterprises in Chicago, including opening 
a billiards and bowling hall and running a semi-professional baseball team 
he dubbed "Anson's Colts". Anson also toured extensively on the vaudeville 
circuit, performing monologues and songs. Many of his business ventures 
failed. As a result, Anson lost his ownership stake in the Colts (by then 
known as the Cubs) and filed for bankruptcy. Anson was inducted into the 
National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939. Anson was born in Marshalltown, 
Iowa.[4][5] Beginning in 1866, he spent two years at the high-school age 
boarding school of the University of Notre Dame after being sent there 
by his father in hopes of curtailing his mischievousness.[8] His time away 
did little to discipline him. Soon after he returned home, his father sent 
him to the University of Iowa, where his bad behavior resulted in the school 
asking him to leave after one semester.[8] Anson played on a number of 
competitive baseball clubs in his youth and began to play professionally 
in the National Association (NA) at the age of 19, playing primarily 3rd 
Base for the Rockford Forest Citys, one of the original teams of the Association.[5][9] 
He was a large and powerful man, standing 6'2" tall and weighing about 
220 pounds.[10] After being traded to Philadelphia Athletics, in 1872 and 
1873, Anson finished in the NA's top five in batting, on-base percentage 
(OBP), and on-base plus slugging (OPS). He led the NA in OBP in 1872. His 
numbers declined slightly in 1874 and 1875, but he was still good enough 
that Chicago White Stockings secretary-turned-president William Hulbert 
sought him to improve his club for the 1876 season. Hulbert broke league 
rules by negotiating with Anson and several other stars while the 1875 
season was still in progress and ultimately founded the new National League 
to forestall any disciplinary action.[5][11] Anson, who had become engaged 
to a Philadelphia native in the meantime,[1] had second thoughts about 
going west, but Hulbert held Anson to his contract and he eventually warmed 
to the Windy City.[12] The White Stockings won the first league title, 
but fell off the pace the following two seasons. During this time, Anson 
was a solid hitter, but not quite a superstar. Both his fortunes and those 
of his team would change after Anson was named captain-manager of the club 
in 1879. His new role led to the nickname "Cap",[5] though newspapers typically 
called him by the more formal "Captain Anson" or "Capt. Anson". With Anson 
pacing the way, the White Stockings won five pennants between 1880 and 
1886. They were helped to the titles using new managerial tactics, including 
the use of a third-base coach, having one fielder back up another, signaling 
batters, and the rotation of two star pitchers.[5][13] In the first half 
of the 1880s, aided by speedy players like Mike Kelly, Anson had his players 
aggressively run the bases, forcing the opposition into making errors. 
After the expression first became popular in the 1890s, he retroactively 
claimed to use some of the first "hit and run" plays. Anson shares credit 
as an innovator of modern spring training along with the president of the 
Chicago club, Albert Spalding. They were among the first to send their 
clubs to warmer climates in the South to prepare for the season, beginning 
in Hot Springs, Arkansas in 1886.[13] On the field, Anson was the team's 
best hitter and run producer. In the 1880s, he won two batting titles (1881, 
1888) and finished second four times (1880, 1882, 1886–1887). During the 
same period, he led the league in runs batted in (RBIs) seven times (1880–82, 
1884–86, 1888). His best season was in 1881, when he led the league in 
batting (.399), OBP (.442), OPS (.952), hits (137), total bases (175), 
and RBIs (82). He also became the first player to hit three consecutive 
home runs, five homers in two games, and four doubles in a game, as well 
as being the first to perform two unassisted double plays in a game. He 
is one of only a few players to score six runs in a game, a feat he accomplished 
on August 24, 1886. Anson signed a ten-year contract in 1888 to manage 
the White Stockings (which, because of a typographical error he failed 
to spot, ended after the 1897 season instead of 1898),[4][13] but his best 
years were behind him. He led the league in walks in 1890 and garnered 
his eighth and final RBI crown in 1891. On the managerial front, he failed 
to win another pennant. As the end of the 1880s approached, the club had 
begun trading away its stars in favor of young players, with the exception 
of the veteran Anson. Local newspapers had started to call the team "Anson's 
Colts", or just "Colts", before the decade was out. With the advent of 
the Players' League in 1890, what little talent the club still had was 
drained away, and the team nickname "Colts", though never official, became 
standard usage in the local media[4][14][15] along with variants such as 
(Anson's) White Colts and (Anson's) Broncos.[13] He also mellowed enough 
that he became a fatherly figure and was often called "Pop".[5] When he 
was fired as manager after the 1897 season, it also marked the end of his 
27-year playing career. The following season, newspapers dubbed the Colts 
the "Orphans", as they had lost their "Pop".[5][13] Anson refused to play 
in exhibition games versus dark-skinned players.[13] On August 10, 1883 
he refused to play an exhibition game against the Toledo Blue Stockings 
because their catcher, Moses Fleetwood Walker, was African American.[13] 
When Blue Stockings Manager Charlie Morton told Anson the White Stockings 
would forfeit the gate receipts if they refused to play, Anson backed down.[5][16] 
In 1884, Chicago again played an exhibition game at Toledo, which was now 
in the American Association, a major league. Walker sat it out, and unclear 
is whether he did so to placate Chicago or because he was injured; Jimmy 
McGuire instead did the catching. Both had sore hands, the Toledo Blade 
had said a few days earlier. Of the two catchers, Walker was seemingly 
the more injured, as he did not play in Toledo's second-most recent game.[17] 
Among Anson's incidents, this one is unique in that private correspondence 
provides insight. Three months before the game, Chicago Treasurer-Secretary 
John A. Brown wrote Toledo manager Charlie Morton that "the management 
of the Chicago Ball Club have no personal feeling about the matter, while 
"the players do most decisively object and to preserve harmony in the club 
it is necessary that I have your assurance in writing that [Walker] will 
not play any position in your nine July 25. I have no doubt such is your 
meaning[;] only your letter does not express in full [sic]. I have no desire 
to replay the occurrence of last season and must have your guarantee to 
that effort.[18] Walker and his brother Welday were released from their 
team later that year, Welday last playing on August 6 and Fleet on September 
4. On July 14, 1887 the Chicago White Stockings played an exhibition game 
against the Newark Little Giants. African American George Stovey was listed 
in the Newark News as the scheduled Newark starting pitcher. Anson objected, 
and Stovey did not pitch. Moreover, International League owners had voted 
6-to-4 at a 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. meeting in Buffalo on the morning of the 
game to exclude African-American players from future contracts.[19] Anson 
acted in ways that would not be tolerated today, because the sport's rules 
are stricter in certain respects. One was the relative freedom a captain 
had in his day to argue with the usually lone umpire. Also, starting in 
the latter 1880s, he often bet on baseball, mainly on his team's chances 
to win the pennant. And yet, he arguably stood out as the player with the 
greatest integrity. In that era, the big taboo was for players to take 
bribes to purposely lose games. Betting by players, managers, and owners 
was regarded as acceptable so long as they did not bet against their team 
doing well or associate with gamblers.[20] On corruption in sports, he 
said the following in 1891: "The time may have been, and probably was, 
when base-ball was as rotten as horse racing, but that time has gone by. 
The men in control of base-ball matters are of the highest personal character, 
and no one will say anything against them. As to the charges against any 
individual player, I will believe them when they have been proved. Every 
thing [sic] possible has been done to protect the patrons of the National 
game, and efforts in that direction will never be abated. I don’t know 
of any crookedness in the ball field. If I did I’d undoubtedly say something 
about it."[21] A chronological review of 162 reports of bets on regular 
season baseball by players, managers or club officials, from 1876 to 1900, 
tallied the sport's top bettors in that era as follows: 1. Anson (57), 
Chicago's captain-manager; Hall of Famer 2. (tie) James "Jim" Mutrie (9), 
mainly as manager of the New York Giants, and his bets were mostly with 
Anson 2. Edward Talcott (9), millionaire stockbroker as treasurer of the 
New York Giants 4. (tie) Mike "King" Kelly (7), mainly as Boston's captain; 
Hall of Famer 4. Frank Robison (7), Cleveland owner[22] Anson first met 
Albert Spalding while both were players; Spalding was a pitcher for the 
Rockford Forest Citys, Anson played for the Marshalltown, Iowa, team.[13] 
Spalding convinced the 18-year-old Anson to come play for the Forest Citys 
at a salary of $65 per month.[13] In 1876, when Anson was playing for Philadelphia, 
Spalding and William Hulbert lured Anson to the Chicago team, which Spalding 
now managed.[13] After signing the contract, Anson had second thoughts 
(his future wife did not want to leave her family in Philadelphia), and 
offered Spalding $1,000 to void the contract.[13] Spalding held Anson to 
the contract, and Anson came to Chicago in March 1876.[13] Spalding retired 
as a player and manager after the 1877 season, but continued as secretary, 
and later president, of the White Stockings.[13] Anson became a player/manager 
of the team in 1879, and by 1889 had a 13% ownership.[1][13] In 1888 Spalding 
announced that the White Stockings, including Anson, and a "picked nine"[1] 
from the rest of the National League would begin a World Tour after the 
end of the season. Spalding put up most of the money, but Anson invested 
$3,750 of his own.[1] James Hart was hired as business manager and Anson 
developed an intense dislike for him.[1] After Spalding stepped down as 
president of the Chicago club in 1891, he appointed James Hart to the position,[13] 
which Anson felt should have been his despite his dismal business record.[1] 
Spalding, however, continued to run the club behind the scenes.[13] In 
December 1892, Hart, with Spalding's blessing, reorganized the White Stockings 
into a stock company.[1] Anson was required to sign a new contract, which 
ended in 1898 instead of 1899 as the previous one had.[1] Anson spotted 
the error later but said nothing, trusting that Spalding would honor the 
previous terms.[1] Hart began to undermine Anson's managerial decisions 
by reversing fines and suspensions imposed by Anson.[1] By 1897 Anson had 
little control over his players; after Anson demanded a sportswriter print 
that Anson thought "the Chicago ball club is composed of drunkards and 
loafers who are throwing him down",[1] his days as manager were numbered. 
Spalding invited Anson and his wife on a four-week journey to England in 
late November 1897.[1] Spalding dropped many hints on the voyage, encouraging 
Anson to voluntarily retire, but Anson had no intention of doing so.[1] 
Things remained in limbo until January 29, 1898 when the Associated Press 
printed a statement by Spalding: "I have taken pains as a mediator to find 
out from Chicagoans how they feel about a change of management. There has 
been a decided undercurrent in favor... Lovers of baseball think that Anson 
has been in power too long."[1] There has been some controversy as to whether 
Anson should be considered the first player ever to reach the 3,000 hit 
milestone. For many years, official statistics credited him with achieving 
that goal. When the first edition of Macmillan's Baseball Encyclopedia 
was published in 1969, it disregarded a rule in place only for the 1887 
season which counted base-on-balls (walks) as hits and times-at-bat instead 
of zeroes in both categories as they were before and have been since. Anson's 
60 walks were removed from his 1887 hit total, resulting in a career mark 
of 2,995, though later editions of the encyclopedia still added five more 
hits to exactly 3,000.[1] The other controversy over Anson's total hits 
had to do with his five years in the National Association.[23] Neither 
the Macmillan Encyclopedia editions nor MLB itself at that time recognized 
the NA as being a true major league.[1] MLB.com does not count Anson's 
time in the NA in his statistics, but tallies his NL total as 3,011 hits.[24] 
This places Anson 25th on the all-time list.[25] Other sources credit Anson 
with a different number of hits, largely because scoring and record keeping 
was haphazard in baseball until well into the 20th century.[26] Beginning 
with the publication of the Baseball Encyclopedia, statisticians have continually 
found errors and have adjusted career totals accordingly. According to 
the Sporting News baseball record book, which does not take NA statistics 
into account, Anson had 3,012 hits over his career.[27] Baseball Reference 
also credits Anson with 3,012 hits during his NL career; including his 
time in the NA, Anson is credited with 3,435 hits.[9] The National Baseball 
Hall of Fame, which uses statistics verified by the Elias Sports Bureau, 
credits Anson with 3,081 hits.[2] This figure disregards games played in 
the NA, but includes the walks earned during 1887 as hits. Anson briefly 
made a return to baseball managing the New York Giants in June and July 
of 1898.[13] He then attempted to buy a Chicago team in the Western League, 
but failed after being opposed by Spalding.[13] In 1900, he helped to organize 
a new version of the defunct American Association, called the New American 
Base Ball Association, and was named its president.[1][5] However, at the 
first sign of trouble he dissolved the league before a single game was 
played, drawing heated criticism from other backers.[1][5] After a number 
of failed business attempts, including a handball arena and bottled ginger 
beer that exploded on store shelves,[1] he was later elected city clerk 
of Chicago in 1905.[28] After serving one term, he failed in the Democratic 
primary to become sheriff in 1907.[29] In 1907, Anson made another attempt 
to come back to baseball, acquiring a semi-pro team in the Chicago City 
League, which he would call "Anson's Colts".[1][5] Anson initially had 
no intention of playing for the team, but in June 1907, at the age of 55, 
Anson started playing some games at first base in an attempt to boost poor 
attendance.[1] Despite the draw of seeing Anson play, the team did not 
attract much attendance, and lost money for Anson.[1] In the fall of 1908, 
Anson assembled a semi-pro football team, also called Anson's Colts. Although 
the football team won the city championship, they were not a financial 
success.[1] Anson's few successful ventures included a combination billiards 
hall and a bowling alley he opened in downtown Chicago in 1899.[1][29] 
Anson was named vice-president of the American Bowling Congress in 1903, 
and led a team to the five-man national championship in 1904.[4] Anson 
was forced to sell the billiards hall in 1909 when faced with mounting 
financial problems that led to his bankruptcy.[29] Anson was also an avid 
golfer. Anson's 1900 book A Ball Player's Career: Being the Personal Reminiscences 
of Adrian C. Anson, was ghostwritten by Chicago horse racing writer and 
poet Richard Cary Jr., who had the pen name of Hyder Ali. Right after it 
was published, Cary told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, "I really thought 
when I started that the ‘Cap’ [sic] would be able to reel off the story 
of his life about as fast as a nimble man would care to write it. It took 
me just two days to find that was not the case. A day and a half to get 
the ‘Cap’ to sit down and the other half day in egging him on. The story 
had to be literally dragged out of him. The incidents of his baseball career 
were apparently fresh in his mind, but when it came to actual dates he 
was all at sea. When he did give a date nine times out of ten it was wrong 
and had to be corrected later on." The New York Times said whether Anson 
"wrote every word in this volume of reminiscences or not[,] the book reads 
characteristically. The expression is Ansonian."[30] Anson began acting 
during his baseball career. In 1888, he made his stage debut with a single 
appearance in Hoyt's play A Parlor Match at the Theatre Comique in Harlem.[31] 
He also played himself in an 1895 Broadway play called The Runaway Colt, 
written to take advantage of his fame.[23][31] Later, Anson began touring 
on the vaudeville circuit, a common practice for athletes of the time,[31] 
which lasted up until about a year before his death.[28] He first appeared 
in vaudeville in 1913 doing a monologue and a short dance. In 1914, George 
M. Cohan wrote a monologue for him,[31] and in 1917, Cohan, with Chicago 
Tribune sportswriter Ring Lardner wrote another piece for him, titled First 
Aid for Father.[1] Anson appeared with two of his grown daughters, Adele 
and Dorothy, and would bat papier-mâché baseballs made by Albert Spalding 
into the audience.[1] He appeared in 1921 accompanied by his two daughters 
in an act written by Ring Lardner with songs by Herman Timberg.[32] Anson 
retired from vaudeville in 1921, and continued to refuse a pension from 
Major League Baseball, despite having no other income.[1] In April 1922, 
he became the general manager of a new golf club in the South Side of Chicago.[1] 
He died on April 14, 1922 in Chicago from a glandular ailment.[33] He was 
interred at the Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago.[34] Anson was inducted into 
the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939, one of the first 19th century players 
selected. Over 100 years after his retirement, he still holds several Cubs 
franchise records, including most career RBI, runs, hits, singles, and 
doubles.[35] Defensively, he also holds the franchise record for putouts, 
but also is second in franchise history for errors.[36] In 1872, the 20-year-old 
Anson met 13-year-old Virginia Fiegal, the daughter of a Philadelphia bar 
and restaurant owner,[1] whom he married on November 21, 1876. The marriage 
lasted until her death in 1915.[1] For the first seven years of their marriage 
the couple lived in Chicago during the baseball season and Philadelphia 
during the off-season, but eventually moved to Chicago on a year-round 
basis.[1] The Ansons had seven children, three of whom died in infancy.[1] 
Daughter Grace was born in October 1877; son Adrian Hulbert was born in 
1882 and died four days later; daughter Adele was born in April 1884; son 
Adrian Constantine, Jr. was born in 1887 and died four months later; daughter 
Dorothy was born in 1889; son John Henry was born in 1892 and died four 
days later; and daughter Virginia Jeanette was born in 1899.[1] Italics
