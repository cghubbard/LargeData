During the 1946 Boston Red Sox season, the Red Sox won their sixth American 
League championship, with a record of 104 wins and 50 losses. In the World 
Series, the Sox lost in 7 games to the St. Louis Cardinals. The winning 
run in game 7 was scored on Enos Slaughter's famous "Mad Dash" in the 8th 
inning that gave the Cards a 4–3 lead. The 1946 Red Sox were led by their 
All-Star left fielder, Ted Williams, who was in his first year back in 
the majors after serving as a fighter pilot in World War II. 1946 was Ted 
Williams first of two MVP seasons, and the only time he ever won a pennant. 
He was among the league leaders in many offensive categories, with a batting 
average of .342, 38 home runs and 123 runs batted in.[1] On April 24, the 
Red Sox were 6–3, 1 game behind the Yankees and tied for second with the 
defending world series champion Tigers.[2] Then, from April 25 through 
May 10, they won 15 games in a row, beating the Yankees twice and sweeping 
the Tigers in a three-game series.[3] Over this stretch Ted Williams had 
a batting average of .442, with 4 home runs and 17 runs batted in.[4] On 
May 10 the Red Sox were 21–3 and leading the American League, 5.5 games 
ahead of the Yankees and 8 games ahead of the Tigers.[5] This was their 
biggest lead in 28 seasons, since winning their last pennant in 1918.[6] 
The fans took notice as the Red Sox had their highest attendance ever, 
nearly doubling their previous record. For the first time in Fenway Park 
history the Red Sox were averaging over 10,000 fans per game, averaging 
18,166 fans per game throughout 1946.[7] The Red Sox never turned back, 
winning 12 straight decisions from May 29 through June 11, including their 
second three-game sweep of the Tigers.[3] On June 11, the Red Sox were 
41–9, 10 games ahead of the Yankees.[8] From June 5 through July 21, in 
48 games, Ted Williams had a batting average of .399, with 18 home runs 
and 52 runs batted in. The Red Sox swept the Tigers for the third time 
that year on July 11–13. On July 14, Williams hit three home runs in a 
game.[4] The Red Sox swept their rivals, the Yankees, in a double-header 
at Yankee Stadium on September 2, expanding their lead to 15.5 games ahead 
of the Yankees and 18 games ahead of the Tigers. The Red Sox clinched the 
American League Pennant on September 13.[9] It was their first Pennant 
since 1918, when they won the World Series. The Red Sox ended the season 
12 games ahead of the Tigers and 17 games ahead of the Yankees.[10] The 
Red Sox played a three-game series against an American League all star 
team following the end of the regular season and the beginning of the World 
Series. While the Red Sox had clinched in September, the St Louis Cardinals 
and Brooklyn Dodgers would play a three-game playoff for the National League 
pennant, pushing back the start of the World Series. The Red Sox hosted 
the three game exhibition series beginning October 1, 1946 at Fenway Park. 
The Red Sox won two of three, but Williams exacerbated his injury which 
would plague him in the Series against St. Louis.[11] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
