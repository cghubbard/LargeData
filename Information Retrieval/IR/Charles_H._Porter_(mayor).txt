1843 in Weymouth, Massachusetts.[1][2] When he was six weeks old his family 
moved to Quincy, Massachusetts, where he resided for the remainder of his

Porter served in the 39th Massachusetts Regiment for three years during 
the American Civil War. He mustered out as a captain, but was later given 
an honorary commission as a lieutenant colonel.[3] Upon his return from

in the new American League. Porter negotiated a deal for the club to play 
in Charles River Park in Cambridge, Massachusetts and had selected a person 
to manage the affairs of the team, but his group backed out after the league's 
backers met with a rival group.[5] Boston would join the American League
