James Bremond Evans (born November 5, 1946, in Longview, Texas) is a former 
umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the American League from 
1971 to 1999.[1] He has operated the Jim Evans Academy of Professional 
Umpiring since 1990. Evans began umpiring Little League games at age 14, 
where his playing experience as a catcher helped in judging balls and strikes.[2] 
Evans graduated from the University of Texas in 1968, and served in the 
National Guard.[3] He then worked as an umpire in college games and in 
the Florida State League.[2] Evans attended the newly formed Umpire Development 
Program in 1969, and then worked in the Texas League (1969â€“70) and American 
Association (1971) before joining the AL staff in late 1971.[2] Evans became 
an AL crew chief in 1981. He wore uniform number 3 starting in 1980 when 
the AL adopted uniform numbers. He umpired in 4 World Series (1977, 1982, 
1986 and 1996), and in 7 American League Championship Series (1975, 1979, 
1983, 1985, 1990, 1993 and 1998), tying a record set by Larry Barnett.[1][4] 
Evans also umpired in the All-Star Game in 1976, 1989, and 1999, serving 
as the home plate umpire in the last two contests.[1] He worked in the 
American League Division Series in 1981, 1995 (Games 3-5) and 1996, and 
also in the single-game playoffs to determine the Eastern division champion 
in 1978 and the Western division champion in 1995.[1][5][6] Evans is one 
of few umpires in history who have worked in two perfect games, having 
been the third base umpire for Mike Witt's perfect game on September 30, 
1984, and the second base umpire for David Cone's perfect game on July 
18, 1999.[7][8] Evans was also the home plate umpire for the first of Nolan 
Ryan's record 7 no-hitters on May 15, 1973, and worked behind the plate
