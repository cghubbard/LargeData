Whitestone is an upper middle-class residential neighborhood in the northernmost 
part of the New York City borough of Queens. The neighborhood proper is 
located between the East River to the north and 25th Avenue to the south. 
Whitestone is surrounded by College Point, Flushing, Bayside, Auburndale, 
Linden Hill, and Murray Hill. Whitestone contains the subsection of Malba, 
which is bounded to the north by the East River, to the east by the Whitestone 
Expressway, to the south by 14th Avenue, and to the west by 138th Street. 
Malba was cited in a New York Times article as one of the few "elite enclaves" 
of Queens.[1] Dutch settlers derived the name of the town from limestone 
that used to lie on the shore of the river according to a popular tradition. 
This tradition is supported by 17th century wills and deeds, which may 
be found in The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, that refer 
to "the white stone" as a local landmark and survey reference point. Whitestone 
got its name because the settlers discovered that Whitestone was built 
on white limestone. The neighborhood is patrolled by the NYPD's 109th Precinct, 
and is part of Queens Community Board 7. It is traditionally bounded by 
the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge (opened 1939) on the west and the Throgs Neck 
Bridge (opened 1961) on the east.[2] The zip code of Whitestone is 11357. 
The area was, in large part, the estate of Francis Lewis, a delegate to 
the Continental Congress and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. 
The estate was the site of an English raid during the Revolutionary War. 
Lewis was not present but his wife was taken prisoner and his house was 
burned to the ground. For a period of time Whitestone was called Clintonville 
after Dewitt Clinton, the former governor of New York; this etymology is 
present in the name of Cliftonville Street, located in the neighborhood. 
In the late 19th century, many wealthy New Yorkers began building mansions 
in the area, on what had once been farmland or woodland. Rapid development 
of the area ensued in the 1920s, however, as trolley and Long Island Rail 
Road train service on the Whitestone Branch was expanded into the neighborhood. 
Although this rail service ended during the Great Depression, part of the 
right-of-way was later used by Robert Moses to help construct the Belt 
Parkway, which includes the Whitestone Expressway which runs along the 
southeast edge of the former Flushing Airport and through Whitestone. Flushing 
Airport has been abandoned since 1985. Further development came with the 
building of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge in 1939. The bridge measures 2,300 
feet and was the fourth longest bridge in the world at the time of its 
construction. The name of the subsection of Malba in northern Whitestone 
is derived from the first letters of the surnames of its five founders 
of the Malba Land Company: Maycock, Alling, Lewis, Bishop, and Avis. Malba 
is considered part of Whitestone, one of the more affluent communities 
in Queens. Demographically, the population is mostly white and of European 
descent (Greek, Irish, Italian, and Jewish), with a small minority of Asian 
Americans. Most of the residential properties in Malba are large homes. 
The first known resident of the area known as present-day Malba was David 
Roe, who arrived from England in the 1640s. According to Clarence Almon 
Torrey's book, David Roe Of Flushing And Some Of His Descendants, Roe became 
a resident of Flushing circa 1666. In 1683, Roe was taxed upon owning 35 
acres (140,000 m2) and thereafter increased his holdings substantially, 
ultimately acquiring the upland around what was to become Malba. Roe's 
farm was on the east side of the bay, which was then known as "Roe's Cove". 
He was among the most well-to-do citizens of Flushing, owning lands, farm 
stock, carpenter's tools and two slaves.[citation needed] In 1786, John 
Powell purchased Roe’s 87-acre (350,000 m2) parcel for 1,685 pounds, 6 
shillings, and 8 pence. It has been reported that Roe lost his lands for 
his allegiance to the crown during the American War of Independence. Powell 
thereafter built a home and the cove was renamed “Powell’s Cove”, the name 
it bears today. During the 19th century, some of Powell's land passed into 
the hands of Harry Genet, a member of the Tammany Hall, New York City's 
infamous political machine. Powell's house was destroyed by fire in the 
1890s. During the second half of the 19th century, the Roe/Powell land 
passed to a succession of owners. A map dating from 1873 lists the Smiths, 
Biningers and Nostrands as landowners in the area. The Nostrand and Smith 
farms represented a large portion of what is Malba today. The area around 
Hill Court and 14th Avenue was known as "Whitestone Heights". In 1883 railroad 
service to Manhattan was extended on the "Whitestone and Westchester Railroad", 
later the Long Island Rail Road. The terminus of the Whitestone line was 
at “Whitestone Landing” (154th Street), a popular summer resort area during 
the late-19th century and early-20th century. William Ziegler, a self-made 
industrialist and president of the Royal Baking Powder Company bought all 
these parcels in or about 1883 and his holdings became known as the "Ziegler 
Tract". Ziegler died on May 24, 1905, leaving his wife, Electa Matilda 
Ziegler (a philanthropist for the blind, among other things) and son, William, 
Jr., then 14 years of age. William S. Champ (Ziegler's former secretary) 
and W.C. Demarest (Mrs. Ziegler's nephew) (both to become among the first 
families residing in Malba) formed a Realty Trust to purchase the Ziegler 
tract from his estate for development purposes. Champ was vice president 
of the Realty Trust, and also one of the executors of Ziegler’s estate. 
The Ziegler Tract had been appraised for $100,000 shortly after Ziegler’s 
death. In the spring of 1906, the Realty Trust secured over 100 investors 
from New Haven, Guilford, Bridgeport, and other Connecticut towns, to the 
planned purchase of the Ziegler Tract. Based on a review of early maps 
of the area, the developers, at one point, planned a very densely populated 
community; with homes on lots no bigger than 20 feet (6.1 m) wide. Obviously, 
this plan was modified and much larger properties were developed. The trust 
represented to the investors that the property could be purchased from 
the Ziegler estate for $640,000. In fact, the 163 acres (0.66 km2) which 
ultimately became Malba, had been earlier purchased from the Ziegler estate 
for $350,000. Thereafter such Connecticut residents as Samuel R. Avis, 
Noble P. Bishop, George W. Lewis, David R. Alling and George Maycock were 
elected trustees (altogether these were the five names that combined to 
form the MALBA name) of the Malba Land Company. The true, lesser, amount 
paid to Ziegler’s estate was not uncovered until 1912. (For a complete 
discussion of the Realty Trust's acquisition of the land and its subsequent 
defense of a lawsuit from the Malba Land Company, see Crowe v. Malba Land 
Co., 135 N.Y.S. 454, 76 Misc. 676 (Sup. Ct. Queens Co. 1912)). Development 
slowly began in 1908. A railroad station on the Whitestone line was added 
where 11th Avenue sits today. The Champs and Demarests were among Malba's 
first families to own homes in Malba. There were thirteen houses by the 
time of World War I and more than a hundred were built in the 1920s. The 
railroad station closed in 1932. The triangle by Malba Drive and 11th Avenue 
was dedicated as “Jane Champ Park” on November 16, 1969 and was renovated 
by the Malba Field and Marine Club in 2005.[3] Based on data from the 2010 
United States Census, the population of Whitestone was 30,773, a decrease 
of 583 (1.9%) from the 31,356 counted in 2000. Covering an area of 1,584.85 
acres (641.37 ha), the neighborhood had a population density of 19.4 inhabitants 
per acre (12,400/sq mi; 4,800/km2).[4] The racial makeup of the neighborhood 
was 68.1% (20,956) White, 0.8% (242) African American, 0.1% (18) Native 
American, 17.4% (5,362) Asian, 0.0% (2) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (90) from 
other races, and 1.1% (351) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino 
of any race were 12.2% (3,752) of the population.[5] As of a 2015 estimate, 
the estimated median household income as of 2015 was $76,834.[6] The New 
York office of Hong Kong-based Lee Kum Kee International Holdings Ltd. 
is located in Whitestone.[7] The Glacéau beverage company operates out 
of Whitestone. The World Journal, the largest Chinese-language newspaper 
in the United States[8] and one of the largest Chinese-language newspapers 
outside of China, with a daily circulation of 350,000, is headquartered 
in Whitestone.[9] The New York City Department of Education operates public 
schools in the area. The Bronx–Whitestone Bridge gives access to and from 
the Bronx, as Whitestone is located across the East River from the Bronx. 
The Bronx-Whitestone Bridge carries I-678 (Whitestone Expressway) across 
the East River. The Cross Island Parkway merges into the Whitestone Expressway 
approximately 0.5 miles (0.80 km) before the bridge. On the Bronx side, 
the bridge leads directly into the Bruckner Interchange, the northern terminus 
of I-678, where the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95 to the west, I-295 to 
the east), Bruckner Expressway (I-278 to the west, I-95 to the east), and 
Hutchinson River Parkway meet. The segment of I-678 between the bridge 
and the Bruckner Interchange is a depressed freeway. New York City Bus 
and MTA Bus Company serve Whitestone on the Q15, Q15A, Q16, Q20A, Q20B, 
Q25, Q34, Q44 SBS, Q50, Q76, QM2, QM20 routes; these buses provide access 
to and from Flushing–Main Street on the IRT Flushing Line (7 <7> trains) 
of the New York City Subway. No subway service directly serves this neighborhood. 
The Whitestone Branch was a branch of the Long Island Rail Road, running 
north and east from Flushing. It ran north along Flushing Bay and east 
along the East River to Whitestone. Originally intended to lead into Westchester 
County, it was consolidated into the Long Island Rail Road in 1876. Stations 
consisted of Flushing–Bridge Street, College Point, Malba, Whitestone–14th 
Avenue, and Whitestone Landing at 155th Street, which later became the 
Beechhurst Yacht Club. Flushing–Bridge Street Station was built in 1870, 
College Point, and Whitestone–14th Avenue stations were opened in 1869, 
and Whitestone Landing Station was built in 1886, all by the F&NS Railroad. 
Malba station was built in 1909 by the LIRR. The line was abandoned on 
February 15, 1932, despite efforts by affected commuters to turn the line 
into a privately operated shuttle route..[10] Community landmarks include 
St. Luke's Roman Catholic Church, Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church, and 
the Dwarf Giraffe Athletic League. The Grace Episcopal Church, on Clintonville 
street, was built in 1858 on land donated by the family of Francis Lewis. 
The Whitestone Hebrew Centre consists of two buildings on Clintonville 
Street and was founded in 1929. The Russian Orthodox Church of St. Nicholas, 
with its distinctive great blue onion dome, was built in 1968. The Greek 
Orthodox Church, Holy Cross, or "Timios Stavros", is located on 150th Street.
