The 2014 Chicago Cubs season was the 143rd season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 139th in the National League and the 99th at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
began the season on the road against the Pittsburgh Pirates on March 31, 
2014 and finished the regular season on September 28, 2014, on the road 
against the Milwaukee Brewers. The Cubs hosted the Philadelphia Phillies 
for Opening Day at Wrigley Field on April 4, 2014. The Cubs' interleague 
opponents were the American League East, in addition to their cross-town 
rivals, the Chicago White Sox. The Cubs finished the season with a 73–89 
record in Rick Renteria's first and only season as manager.[1] This season 
marked the 100th season of play at Wrigley Field, though the Cubs did not 
start playing there until 1916. To mark the occasion, the Cubs wore different 
uniforms to represent each decade during ten homestands throughout the 
season. Dale Sveum was fired as manager on September 30, 2013. His total 
record with the Cubs in two years was 127–197. Rick Renteria was hired 
as the manager of the Chicago Cubs on November 7, 2013 and signed a three-year 
contract.[2] The Cubs opened a new spring training facility in Mesa, Arizona 
called Cubs Park. The park replaces HoHoKam Stadium which had been their 
spring training home since 1979.[3] With a capacity of 15,000, Cubs Park 
becomes the largest spring training stadium by capacity in Major League 
Baseball, surpassing Camelback Ranch in Glendale.[4] The Cubs finished 
their first winning season at Wrigley Field since 2009 with a record of 
41–40.[8] 2,652,113 fans attended Cubs home games which is the best since 
the 2008 season.[9] Infielders Outfielders Coaching Staff Batting statistics
