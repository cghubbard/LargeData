Edward (E.D.) Joseph Farmer (born October 18, 1949) is a former Major League 
relief pitcher with an 11-year career from 1971–1974 and 1977–1983. He 
played for the Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, Baltimore Orioles, Milwaukee 
Brewers, Texas Rangers, Chicago White Sox and Oakland A's, all in the American 
League, and the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League. Farmer is 
currently the play-by-play broadcaster for Chicago White Sox radio broadcasts. 
Farmer attended St. Rita High School on the southwest side of Chicago. 
Farmer's best seasons were with the Chicago White Sox from 1979 to 1981. 
He was acquired by Chicago with Gary Holle in June of the 1979 season from 
the Texas Rangers in exchange for Eric Soderholm.[1] Farmer responded by 
recording 14 saves for the Sox, 13 of them coming after the All-Star break. 
A notable feud started between Al Cowens and Farmer early in the 1979 season. 
On May 8 while playing the Kansas City Royals, a Farmer pitch thrown in 
the top of the 5th inning fractured Cowens' jaw and broke several teeth;[2] 
Cowens would miss 21 games. Farmer also hit Royal Frank White in the same 
game and broke his wrist[3] and caused him to miss 33 contests. The next 
season on June 20‚ 1980 while playing Detroit‚ the now-Tiger Cowens hit 
an infield grounder against Farmer at Comiskey Park. While Farmer watched 
his infielder make the play, Cowens ran to mound and tackled the pitcher 
from behind, instead of running to first base; getting in several punches 
before the benches cleared and the two were separated.[3] Cowens was suspended 
for 7 games and a warrant was issued for his arrest in Illinois‚ forcing 
him to skip the remainder of the series. Later Farmer agreed to drop the 
charges in exchange for a handshake‚ and the 2 players brought out the 
lineup cards before the game on September 1. However, future appearances 
for Cowens in Chicago were greeted with a "Coward Cowens" banner. Despite 
the ongoing feud with Cowens, 1980 would be Farmer's best. He was selected 
to the American League All-Star team when he compiled 18 saves prior to 
the break and finished the season with career highs in saves with 30 and 
wins with 7. Farmer started only 21 games of his career. His other 349 
appearances were out of the bullpen. In 370 total games, he holds a 30–43 
record with a 4.28 ERA. He accumulated 395 strikeouts in 624 innings pitched. 
Farmer finished his career with 75 career saves. Farmer was a scout in 
the Orioles organization for three years between 1988–1990. Afterwards, 
he became the color commentator on White Sox radio broadcasts, where he 
became well-known among fans by the nickname "Farmio", from 1991 to 2005, 
when it was announced that Farmer would be taking over full-time play-by-play 
duties for the team the following year when longtime partner John Rooney 
moved to the St. Louis Cardinals Radio Network. Farmer's current broadcast 
partner is Darrin Jackson. On July 18, 2015, as an announcer for the Chicago 
White Sox radio broadcast, Farmer twice advocated for White Sox pitchers 
to intentionally hit Kansas City Royals batters during a broadcast. Following 
a 13th inning home run by Royals batter Lorenzo Cain, Farmer said, "If 
I'm on the mound and he does that, next time up when I face him he's looking
