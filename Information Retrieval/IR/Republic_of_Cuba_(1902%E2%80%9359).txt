The Republic of Cuba (Spanish: República de Cuba) of 1902 to 1959, refers 
to the historical period in Cuba from 1902, when Cuba seceded from US rule 
in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War that took Cuba from Spanish 
rule in 1898, until the Cuban Revolution of 1959. Cuban independence from 
the United States was guaranteed in the Platt Amendment proposed to the 
United States Congress in 1901.[1] It was officially a representative democracy 
though at times it became controlled by a military junta. The Cuban Revolution 
of 1959 massively changed Cuban society, creating a socialist state and 
ended US economic dominance in Cuba. Cuba during this time has been regarded 
as a client state of the United States.[2] In 1934, Cuba and the United 
States signed the Treaty of Relations in which Cuba was obligated to give 
preferential treatment of its economy to the United States, in exchange 
the United States gave Cuba a guaranteed 22 percent share of the US sugar 
market that later was amended to a 49 percent share in 1949.[3] After the 
Spanish–American War, Spain and the United States signed the Treaty of 
Paris (1898), by which Spain ceded Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam 
to the United States for the sum of $20 million.[4] Cuba gained formal 
independence from the U.S. on May 20, 1902, as the Republic of Cuba.[5] 
Under Cuba's new constitution, the U.S. retained the right to intervene 
in Cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations. Under 
the Platt Amendment, the U.S. leased the Guantánamo Bay naval base from 
Cuba. Following disputed elections in 1906, the first president, Tomás 
Estrada Palma, faced an armed revolt by veterans of the war for independence 
who defeated the government's meager forces.[6] The U.S. intervened by 
occupying Cuba and named Charles Edward Magoon as Governor for three years. 
Cuban historians have attributed Magoon's governorship as having introduced 
political and social corruption.[7] In 1908, self-government was restored 
when José Miguel Gómez was elected President, but the U.S. continued intervening 
in Cuban affairs. In 1912, the Partido Independiente de Color attempted 
to establish a separate black republic in Oriente Province,[8] but was 
suppressed by General Monteagudo with considerable bloodshed. In 1924, 
Gerardo Machado was elected president. During his administration, tourism 
increased markedly, and American-owned hotels and restaurants were built 
to accommodate the influx of tourists. The tourist boom led to increases 
in gambling and prostitution.[9] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 led to precipitous 
drops in the price of sugar, political unrest, and repression.[10] Protesting 
students, known as the Generation of 1930, turned to violence in opposition 
to the increasingly unpopular Machado.[10] A general strike (in which the 
Communist Party sided with Machado),[11] uprisings among sugar workers, 
and an army revolt forced Machado into exile in August 1933. He was replaced 
by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada.[10] In September 1933, the Sergeants' 
Revolt, led by Sergeant Fulgencio Batista, overthrew Cespedes.[12] General 
Alberto Herrera served briefly as president (August 12–13) followed by 
Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada from August 13 until September 5, 1933. 
A five-member executive committee (the Pentarchy of 1933) was chosen to 
head a provisional government.[13] They were ousted by a student-led organization, 
the Student Directory and Ramon Grau San Martin was then appointed as provisional 
president.[13] Grau resigned in 1934, after which Batista dominated Cuban 
politics for the next 25 years, at first through a series of puppet-presidents.[12] 
The period from 1933 to 1937 was a time of "virtually unremitting social 
and political warfare".[14] A new constitution was adopted in 1940, which 
engineered radical progressive ideas, including the right to labor and 
health care.[15] Batista was elected president in the same year, holding 
the post until 1944.[16] He is so far the only non-white Cuban to win the 
nation's highest political office.[17][18][19] His government carried out 
major social reforms. Several members of the Communist Party held office 
under his administration.[20] Cuban armed forces were not greatly involved 
in combat during World War II, although president Batista suggested a joint 
U.S.-Latin American assault on Francoist Spain in order to overthrow its 
authoritarian regime.[21] Batista adhered to the 1940 constitution's strictures 
preventing his re-election.[22] Ramon Grau San Martin was the winner of 
the next election, in 1944.[16] Grau further corroded the base of the already 
teetering legitimacy of the Cuban political system, in particular by undermining 
the deeply flawed, though not entirely ineffectual, Congress and Supreme 
Court.[23] Carlos Prío Socarrás, a protégé of Grau, became president in 
1948.[16] The two terms of the Auténtico Party saw an influx of investment 
which fueled a boom and raised living standards for all segments of society 
and created a prosperous middle class in most urban areas.[citation needed] 
After running unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1952, Batista staged 
a coup.[24] He outlawed the Cuban Communist Party in 1952.[25] Cuba had 
Latin America's highest per capita consumption rates of meat, vegetables, 
cereals, automobiles, telephones and radios, though about one third of 
the population was considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this 
consumption.[26] In 1958, Cuba was a relatively well-advanced country by 
Latin American standards, and in some cases by world standards.[27] On 
the other hand, Cuba was affected by perhaps the largest labor union privileges 
in Latin America, including bans on dismissals and mechanization. They 
were obtained in large measure "at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants", 
leading to disparities.[28] Between 1933 and 1958, Cuba extended economic 
regulations enormously, causing economic problems.[17][29] Unemployment 
became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs.[17] 
The middle class, which was comparable to that of the United States, became 
increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution. 
The labor unions supported Batista until the very end.[17][18] Batista
