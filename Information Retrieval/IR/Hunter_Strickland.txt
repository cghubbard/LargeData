Hunter Drew Strickland (born September 24, 1988) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Strickland was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 18th round, 
564th overall pick, of the 2007 MLB Draft. On July 22, 2009, he was acquired 
by the Pittsburgh Pirates along with Argenis Díaz in a trade with the Red 
Sox in exchange for Adam LaRoche.[1] In November 2012, the Pirates added 
Strickland to the 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.[2] 
On March 27, 2013, Strickland was designated for assignment by the Pirates, 
and on April 2, the San Francisco Giants claimed Strickland off waivers.[3] 
He was added to the Giants' 40-man roster on November 20, 2013.[4] Strickland 
was called up to the majors for the first time on September 1, 2014.[5] 
He pitched one scoreless inning of relief against the Colorado Rockies 
later that day.[6] In the 2014 regular season, Strickland appeared in 9 
games, allowing 5 hits and no runs in 7.0 innings pitched.[7] In Game 1 
of the 2014 National League Division Series versus the Washington Nationals, 
Strickland entered the game with the bases loaded and two outs in the sixth 
inning and struck out Ian Desmond to preserve the Giants' lead.[8] In Game 
2, Strickland recorded the save in the longest (by time, tied for longest 
in innings) playoff game in Major League history,[9] as the Giants defeated 
the Nationals 2–1 in 18 innings.[10] However, Strickland set a postseason 
record by allowing six home runs,[11] even though the Giants went on to 
defeat the Kansas City Royals in the 2014 World Series. Strickland started 
the 2015 season with the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats, posting a 1.66 
ERA in 21.2 innings, before being called up on May 24, 2015.[12][13] Strickland 
did not yield a home run until August 3, a string of 188 batters between 
Triple-A and the majors.[14] In 2015, Strickland appeared in 55 games, 
recording a 2.45 ERA with 50 strikeouts in 51.1 innings pitched. Strickland's 
0.857 WHIP was the third-lowest among relievers with at least 50 innings
