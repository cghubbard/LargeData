Ruth Cleveland (October 3, 1891 – January 7, 1904), popularly known as 
Baby Ruth, was the eldest of three children born to United States President 
Grover Cleveland and the First Lady Frances Cleveland. Her birth between 
Cleveland's two terms of office caused a national sensation. Interest in 
her continued even after her father's second presidential term was over. 
A sickly child, Cleveland contracted diphtheria in early January 1904. 
Doctors thought her case was mild, but she died four days after being diagnosed. 
Cleveland is buried in Princeton Cemetery.[1] The Curtiss Candy Company 
asserted that the "Baby Ruth" candy bar (formerly known as Kandy Kake from 
1900–1920) was named after Ruth Cleveland, a claim that the urban legends 
website Snopes.com has debunked. The renaming of the candy bar took place 
in 1921, thirty years after Ruth Cleveland's birth and seventeen years 
after her death. That same year, legendary baseball player George Herman 
Ruth, better known by the nickname Babe Ruth, was nearing the top of his 
popularity, having just broken the single-season home run record.[2] As 
Richard Sandomir of The New York Times pointed out, "For 85 years, Babe 
Ruth, the slugger, and Baby Ruth, the candy bar, have lived parallel lives 
in which it has been widely assumed that the latter was named for the former. 
The confection's creator, the Curtiss Candy Company, never admitted to 
what looks like an obvious connection – especially since Ruth hit 54 home 
runs the year before the first Baby Ruth was devoured. Had it done so, 
Curtiss would have had to compensate Ruth. Instead, it eventually insisted 
the inspiration was "Baby Ruth" Cleveland, the daughter of President Grover 
Cleveland. But it is an odd connection that makes one wonder at the marketing
