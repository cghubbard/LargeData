George Michael Cohan (July 3, 1878[1] – November 5, 1942), known professionally 
as George M. Cohan, was an American entertainer, playwright, composer, 
lyricist, actor, singer, dancer and producer. Cohan began his career as 
a child, performing with his parents and sister in a vaudeville act known 
as "The Four Cohans." Beginning with Little Johnny Jones in 1904, he wrote, 
composed, produced, and appeared in more than three dozen Broadway musicals. 
Cohan published more than 300 songs during his lifetime, including the 
standards "Over There", "Give My Regards to Broadway", "The Yankee Doodle 
Boy" and "You're a Grand Old Flag".[2] As a composer, he was one of the 
early members of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers 
(ASCAP). He displayed remarkable theatrical longevity, appearing in films 
until the 1930s, and continuing to perform as a headline artist until 1940. 
Known in the decade before World War I as "the man who owned Broadway", 
he is considered the father of American musical comedy.[2] His life and 
music were depicted in the Academy Award-winning film Yankee Doodle Dandy 
(1942) and the 1968 musical George M!. A statue of Cohan in Times Square 
in New York City commemorates his contributions to American musical theatre. 
Cohan was born in 1878 in Providence, Rhode Island, to Irish Catholic parents. 
A baptismal certificate from St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church (which 
gave the wrong first name for his mother) indicated that he was born on 
July 3, but Cohan and his family always insisted that George had been "born 
on the Fourth of July!"[1][3] George's parents were traveling vaudeville 
performers, and he joined them on stage while still an infant, first as 
a prop, learning to dance and sing soon after he could walk and talk.[citation 
needed] Cohan started as a child performer at age 8, first on the violin 
and then as a dancer.[4] He was the fourth member of the family vaudeville 
act called The Four Cohans, which included his father Jeremiah "Jere" (Keohane) 
Cohan (1848–1917),[5] mother Helen "Nellie" Costigan Cohan (1854–1928) 
and sister Josephine "Josie" Cohan Niblo (1876–1916).[1] In 1890, he toured 
as the star of a show called Peck's Bad Boy[4] and then joined the family 
act; The Four Cohans mostly toured together from 1890 to 1901. He and his 
sister made their Broadway debut in 1893 in a sketch called The Lively 
Bootblack. Temperamental in his early years, Cohan later learned to control 
his frustrations. During these years, Cohan originated his famous curtain 
speech: "My mother thanks you, my father thanks you, my sister thanks you, 
and I thank you."[4] As a child, Cohan and his family toured most of the 
year and spent summer vacations from the vaudeville circuit at his grandmother's 
home in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, where Cohan befriended baseball 
player Connie Mack.[6] The family generally gave a performance at the town 
hall there each summer, and Cohan had a chance to gain some more normal 
childhood experiences, like riding his bike and playing sandlot baseball. 
Cohan's memories of those happy summers inspired his 1907 musical 50 Miles 
from Boston, which is set in North Brookfield and contains one of his most 
famous songs, “Harrigan". As Cohan matured through his teens, he used the 
quiet summers there to write. When he returned to the town in the cast 
of Ah, Wilderness! in 1934, he told a reporter, "I've knocked around everywhere, 
but there's no place like North Brookfield."[7] Cohan began writing original 
skits (over 150 of them) and songs for the family act in both vaudeville 
and minstrel shows while in his teens.[4] Soon he was writing professionally, 
selling his first songs to a national publisher in 1893. In 1901 he wrote, 
directed and produced his first Broadway musical, "The Governor's Son", 
for The Four Cohans.[4] His first big Broadway hit in 1904 was the show 
Little Johnny Jones, which introduced his tunes "Give My Regards to Broadway" 
and "The Yankee Doodle Boy."[8] Cohan became one of the leading Tin Pan 
Alley songwriters, publishing upwards of 300 original songs[2] noted for 
their catchy melodies and clever lyrics. His major hit songs included "You're 
a Grand Old Flag," "Forty-Five Minutes from Broadway," "Mary Is a Grand 
Old Name," "The Warmest Baby in the Bunch," "Life's a Funny Proposition 
After All," "I Want To Hear a Yankee Doodle Tune," "You Won't Do Any Business 
If You Haven't Got a Band," "The Small Town Gal," "I'm Mighty Glad I'm 
Living, That's All," "That Haunting Melody," "Always Leave Them Laughing 
When You Say Goodbye", and America's most popular World War I song "Over 
There",[4] which was recorded by Enrico Caruso among others.[9] The latter 
song reached such currency among troops and shipyard workers that a ship 
was named "Costigan" after Cohan's grandfather, Dennis Costigan. During 
the christening, "Over There" was played.[10] From 1904 to 1920, Cohan 
created and produced over fifty musicals, plays and revues on Broadway 
together with his friend Sam Harris,[4][11] including Give My Regards to 
Broadway and the successful Going Up in 1917, which became a smash hit 
in London the following year.[12] His shows ran simultaneously in as many 
as five theatres. One of Cohan's most innovative plays was a dramatization 
of the mystery Seven Keys to Baldpate in 1913, which baffled some audiences 
and critics but became a hit.[13] Cohan further adapted it as a film in 
1917, and it was adapted for film six more times, as well as for TV and 
radio.[14] He dropped out of acting for some years after his 1919 dispute 
with Actors' Equity Association, described below.[4] In 1925, he published 
his autobiography, Twenty Years on Broadway and the Years It Took To Get 
There.[15] Cohan appeared in 1930 in a revival of his tribute to vaudeville 
and his father, The Song and Dance Man.[4] In 1932, Cohan starred in a 
dual role as a cold, corrupt politician and his charming, idealistic campaign 
double in the Hollywood musical film The Phantom President. The film co-starred 
Claudette Colbert and Jimmy Durante, with songs by Rodgers and Hart, and 
was released by Paramount Pictures. He appeared in some earlier silent 
films but he disliked Hollywood production methods and only made one other 
sound film, Gambling (1934), based on his own 1929 play and shot in New 
York City. A critic called Gambling a "stodgy adaptation of a definitely 
dated play directed in obsolete theatrical technique."[16] It is considered 
a lost film.[17] Cohan earned acclaim as a serious actor in Eugene O'Neill's 
only comedy, Ah, Wilderness! (1933), and in the role of a song-and-dance 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Rodgers and Hart's musical I'd Rather 
Be Right (1937). The same year, he reunited with Harris to produce a play 
called Fulton of Oak Falls, starring Cohan. His final play, The Return 
of the Vagabond (1940), featured a young Celeste Holm in the cast.[18] 
In 1940, Judy Garland played the title role in a film version of his 1922 
musical Little Nellie Kelly. Cohan's mystery play Seven Keys to Baldpate 
was first filmed in 1916 and has been remade seven times, most recently 
as House of Long Shadows (1983), starring Vincent Price. In 1942, a musical 
biopic of Cohan, Yankee Doodle Dandy, was released, and James Cagney's 
performance in the title role earned the Best Actor Academy Award. The 
film was privately screened for Cohan as he battled the last stages of 
abdominal cancer; Cohan’s comment on Cagney’s performance was, "My God, 
what an act to follow!"[19] Cohan's 1920 play The Meanest Man in the World 
was filmed in 1943 with Jack Benny.[20] Although Cohan is mostly remembered 
for his songs, he became an early pioneer in the development of the "book 
musical", using his engaging libretti to bridge the gaps between drama 
and music. More than three decades before Agnes de Mille choreographed 
Oklahoma!, Cohan used dance not merely as razzle-dazzle, but to advance 
the plot. Cohan's main characters were "average Joes and Janes" that appealed 
to a wide American audience.[21] In 1914, Cohan became one of the founding 
members of ASCAP.[22] Although Cohan was known as extremely generous to 
his fellow actors in need,[4] in 1919, he unsuccessfully opposed a historic 
strike by Actors' Equity Association, for which many in the theatrical 
professions never forgave him. Cohan opposed the strike because in addition 
to being an actor in his productions, he was also the producer of the musical 
that set the terms and conditions of the actors' employment. During the 
strike, he donated $100,000 to finance the Actors' Retirement Fund in Englewood 
Cliffs, New Jersey. After Actors' Equity was recognized, Cohan refused 
to join the union as an actor, which hampered his ability to appear in 
his own productions. Cohan sought a waiver from Equity allowing him to 
act in any theatrical production. In 1930, Cohan won a law case against 
the Internal Revenue Service that allowed the deduction, for federal income 
tax purposes, of his business travel and entertainment expenses, even though 
he was not able to document them with certainty. This became known as the 
"Cohan rule" and is frequently cited in tax cases.[23] Cohan wrote numerous 
Broadway musicals and straight plays in addition to contributing material 
to shows written by others—more than 50 in all.[4] Cohan shows included 
Little Johnny Jones (1904), Forty-five Minutes from Broadway (1905), George 
Washington, Jr. (1906), The Talk of New York and The Honeymooners (1907), 
Fifty Miles from Boston and The Yankee Prince (1908), Broadway Jones (1912), 
Seven Keys to Baldpate (1913), The American Idea, Get Rich Quick Wallingford, 
The Man Who Owns Broadway, Little Nellie Kelly, The Cohan Revue of 1916 
(and 1918; co-written with Irving Berlin), The Tavern (1920), The Rise 
of Rosie O'Reilly (1923, featuring a 13-year-old Ruby Keeler among the 
chorus girls), The Song and Dance Man (1923), Molly Malone, The Miracle 
Man, Hello Broadway, American Born (1925), The Baby Cyclone (1927, one 
of Spencer Tracy's early breaks), Elmer the Great (1928, co-written with 
Ring Lardner), and Pigeons and People (1933).[4] At this point in his life, 
he walked in and out of retirement.[22] Cohan was called "the greatest 
single figure the American theatre ever produced – as a player, playwright, 
actor, composer and producer."[4] On June 29, 1936, President Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt presented him with the Congressional Gold Medal for his 
contributions to World War I morale, in particular the songs "You're a 
Grand Old Flag" and "Over There."[22] Cohan was the first person in any 
artistic field selected for this honor, which previously had gone only 
to military and political leaders, philanthropists, scientists, inventors, 
and explorers. In 1959, at the behest of lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II, 
a $100,000 bronze statue of Cohan was dedicated in Times Square at Broadway 
and 46th Street in Manhattan. The 8-foot bronze remains the only statue 
of an actor on Broadway.[24] He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall 
of Fame in 1970,[22] and into the American Folklore Hall of Fame in 2003.[citation 
needed] His star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is located at 6734 Hollywood 
Boulevard.[25] Cohan was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame 
on October 15, 2006.[26] The United States Postal Service issued a 15-cent 
commemorative stamp honoring Cohan on the anniversary of his centenary, 
July 3, 1978. The stamp depicts both the older Cohan and his younger self 
as a dancer, along with the tag line "Yankee Doodle Dandy." It was designed 
by Jim Sharpe.[27] On July 3, 2009, a bronze bust of Cohan, by artist Robert 
Shure, was unveiled at the corner of Wickenden and Governor Streets in 
Fox Point, Providence, a few blocks from his birthplace. The city renamed 
the corner the George M. Cohan Plaza and announced an annual George M. 
Cohan Award for Excellence in Art & Culture. The first award went to Curt 
Columbus, the artistic director of Trinity Repertory Company.[28] From 
1899 to 1907, Cohan was married to Ethel Levey (1881–1955; born Grace Ethelia 
Fowler[29]), a musical comedy actress and dancer. Levey and Cohan had a 
daughter, actress Georgette Cohan Souther Rowse (1900–1988).[30] Levey 
joined the Four Cohans when Josie married, and she starred in Little Johnny 
Jones and other Cohan works. In 1907, Levey divorced Cohan on grounds of 
adultery.[31] In 1908 Cohan married Agnes Mary Nolan (1883–1972), who had 
been a dancer in his early shows; they remained married until his death. 
They had two daughters and a son. The eldest was Mary Cohan Ronkin, a cabaret 
singer in the 1930s, who composed incidental music for her father's play 
The Tavern. In 1968, Mary supervised musical and lyric revisions for the 
musical George M!.[32][33] Their second daughter was Helen Cohan Carola, 
a film actress, who performed on Broadway with her father in Friendship 
in 1931.[34][35] Their youngest child was George Michael Cohan, Jr. (1914–2000), 
who graduated from Georgetown University and served in the entertainment 
corps during World War II. In the 1950s, George Jr. reinterpreted his father's 
songs on recordings, in a nightclub act, and in television appearances 
on the Ed Sullivan and Milton Berle shows. George Jr.'s only child, Michaela 
Marie Cohan (1943–1999), was the last descendant named Cohan. She graduated 
with a theater degree from Marywood College, Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 
1965. From 1966 to 1968, she served in a civilian Special Services unit 
in Vietnam and Korea.[36] In 1996, she stood in for her ailing father at 
the ceremony marking her grandfather's induction into the Musical Theatre 
Hall of Fame at New York University.[4] Cohan was a devoted baseball fan, 
regularly attending games of the former New York Giants.[4] He died of 
cancer at the age of 64 on November 5, 1942, at his Manhattan apartment 
on Fifth Avenue, surrounded by family and friends. He received his last 
rites from Mgr. John J. Casey, representing Archbishop Francis Spellman, 
and Rev. Francis X. Shea, vicar of the Archdiocese of New York.[4] His 
funeral was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York and was attended 
by thousands of people, including five governors of New York, two mayors 
of New York City and the Postmaster General. The honorary pallbearers included 
Irving Berlin, Eddie Cantor, Frank Crowninshield, Sol Bloom, Brooks Atkinson, 
Rube Goldberg, Walter Huston, George Jessel, Connie Mack, Joseph McCarthy, 
Eugene O’Neill, Sigmund Romberg, Lee Shubert and Fred Waring.[37] Cohan 
was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City, in a private 
family mausoleum he had erected a quarter century earlier for his sister
