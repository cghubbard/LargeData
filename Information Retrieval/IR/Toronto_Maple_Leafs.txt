          The Toronto Maple Leafs (officially the Toronto Maple Leaf Hockey 
Club) are a Canadian professional ice hockey team based in Toronto, Ontario, 
that competes in the National Hockey League (NHL). The Maple Leafs are 
a member club of the league's Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference. 
The team is one of the "Original Six" league members. They are owned by 
Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, Ltd. and are represented by Chairman 
Larry Tanenbaum. In February 1999, they moved to the Air Canada Centre, 
which replaced Maple Leaf Gardens, the team's home since 1931. The franchise 
was founded in 1917, operating simply as Toronto and known today as the 
Toronto Arenas, as it was operated by the Toronto Arena Company, owners 
of the Arena Gardens arena. In 1919, the NHL transferred the franchise 
to new owners who christened the team the Toronto St. Patricks. The franchise 
was sold in 1927 and was renamed the Toronto Maple Leaf Hockey Club. The 
team colours are navy blue and white. The Maple Leafs have won thirteen 
Stanley Cup championships, second only to the 24 championships of their 
primary rival, the Montreal Canadiens. They won their last championship 
in 1967. Their 48-season drought between championships is currently the 
longest in the NHL. With an estimated worth of US$1.3 billion, the Leafs 
are the most valuable franchise in the NHL, followed by the New York Rangers 
and the Montreal Canadiens. In 2015, they were ranked by Forbes as the 
37th most valuable sports team in the world (and the only NHL team to be 
in the top 50).[4] The National Hockey League was formed in 1917 in Montreal 
by teams formerly belonging to the National Hockey Association (NHA) that 
had a dispute with Eddie Livingstone, owner of the Toronto Blueshirts. 
The owners of the other four clubs — the Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers, 
Quebec Bulldogs and Ottawa Senators — wanted to get rid of Livingstone, 
but discovered that the NHA constitution did not allow them to simply vote 
him out of the league. Instead, they opted to create a new league, the 
NHL, and did not invite Livingstone to join them. They also remained voting 
members of the NHA, and thus had enough votes to suspend the other league's 
operations, effectively leaving Livingstone's squad in a one-team league.[5][6][7] 
However, the other clubs wanted to have a team from Toronto (Canada's second 
largest city at the time). They also needed another team to balance the 
schedule after the Bulldogs suspended operations (and as it turned out, 
would not ice a team until 1920). The NHL granted a "temporary" Toronto 
franchise to the Arena Company, owners of the Arena Gardens.[8] The Arena 
Company leased the Blueshirts' players and was given until the end of the 
season to resolve the dispute with Livingstone. The franchise did not have 
an official name, but was informally called "the Blueshirts" or "the Torontos" 
by the fans and press.[9] Under Manager Charlie Querrie and Head Coach 
Dick Carroll, the Toronto team won the Stanley Cup in the NHL's inaugural 
season.[7] Although the roster was composed almost entirely of former Blueshirts, 
the Maple Leafs do not claim the Blueshirts' history. For the next season, 
rather than return the Blueshirts' players to Livingstone as originally 
promised, the Arena Company formed its own team, the Toronto Arena Hockey 
Club, which was readily granted membership in the NHL. Also that year, 
the Arena Company decided that only NHL teams would be allowed to play 
at the Arena Gardens—a move which effectively killed the NHA.[5] Livingstone 
sued to get his players back. Mounting legal bills from the dispute forced 
the Arenas to sell most of their stars, resulting in a horrendous five-win 
season in 1918–19. When it was obvious that the Arenas would not be able 
to finish the season, the NHL agreed to let the team halt operations on 
February 20, 1919. The NHL ended its season and started the playoffs. The 
Arenas' .278 winning percentage that season is still the worst in franchise 
history. However, the 1919 Stanley Cup Finals ended without a winner due 
to the worldwide flu epidemic. The legal dispute forced the Arena Company 
into bankruptcy, and it was forced to sell the team. Querrie put together 
a group that mainly consisted of the people who had run the senior amateur 
St. Patricks team in the Ontario Hockey Association. The new owners renamed 
the team the Toronto St. Patricks (or St. Pats for short), which would 
operate until 1927. The team's jersey colours changed from blue to green, 
winning a second Stanley Cup championship in 1922.[10] During this time, 
the St. Patricks allowed other teams to play in the Arena whenever their 
home rinks lacked proper ice in the warmer months. At the time, the Arena 
was the only facility east of Manitoba with artificial ice.[11] Querrie 
lost a lawsuit to Livingstone and decided to sell the St. Pats. He gave 
serious consideration to a CAD$200,000 bid from a Philadelphia group. However, 
Toronto Varsity Graduates coach Conn Smythe put together a group of his 
own and made a $160,000 offer. With the support of St. Pats shareholder 
J. P. Bickell, Smythe persuaded Querrie to accept their bid, arguing that 
civic pride was more important than money. After taking control on Valentine's 
Day 1927, Smythe immediately renamed the team the Maple Leafs. The Maple 
Leafs say that the name was chosen in honour of the Maple Leaf Regiment 
from World War I; however, the Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team had won 
the International League championship a few months earlier and had been 
using that name for 30 years. As the regiment is a proper noun, its plural 
is Maple Leafs (not Maple Leaves). Another story says that Smythe named 
the team after a team he had once scouted, called the East Toronto Maple 
Leafs, while Smythe's grandson stated that Smythe named the team after 
the Maple Leaf insignia he had worn during the First World War.[12] Initial 
reports were that the team's colours would be red and white,[13] but the 
Leafs wore white sweaters with a green maple leaf for their first game 
on February 17, 1927.[14] The next season, the Leafs appeared for the first 
time in the blue and white sweaters they have worn ever since. The Maple 
Leafs say that blue represents the Canadian skies and white represents 
snow. However, they also followed the longstanding tradition of top-level 
Toronto teams using blue as their primary colour, which started with the 
Toronto Argonauts in 1873 and the University of Toronto Varsity Blues in 
1877, and had been upheld by the Maple Leafs baseball team. After four 
more lacklustre seasons (including three with Smythe as coach), Smythe 
and the Leafs debuted at their new arena, Maple Leaf Gardens, with a 2–1 
loss to the Chicago Black Hawks on November 12, 1931. Led by the "Kid Line" 
(Busher Jackson, Joe Primeau and Charlie Conacher) and coach Dick Irvin, 
the Leafs captured their third Stanley Cup during that season, vanquishing 
the Montreal Maroons in the first round, the Boston Bruins in the semifinals, 
and the New York Rangers in the finals. Smythe took particular pleasure 
in defeating the Rangers that year; he had been tapped as the Rangers' 
first general manager and coach in the Rangers' inaugural season (1926–27), 
but had been fired in a dispute with Madison Square Garden management before 
the season. Leafs star forward Ace Bailey was nearly killed in 1933 when 
Boston Bruins defenceman Eddie Shore checked him from behind into the boards 
at full speed. Maple Leafs defenceman Red Horner knocked Shore out with 
a punch, but Bailey, writhing on the ice, had his career ended. The Leafs 
would hold the NHL's first All-Star Game to benefit Bailey. The Leafs reached 
the Finals five times in the next seven years, but bowed out to the now-defunct 
Maroons in 1935, the Detroit Red Wings in 1936, the Chicago Black Hawks 
in 1938, Boston in 1939 and the hated Rangers in 1940. At this time, Smythe 
allowed Irvin to go to Montreal to help revive the then-moribund Canadiens, 
replacing him as coach with former Leafs captain Hap Day. In the 1942 season, 
the Maple Leafs were down three games to none in a best-of-seven final 
in the playoffs against Detroit. Fourth-line forward Don Metz then galvanized 
the team, coming from nowhere to score a hat-trick in game four and the 
game-winner in game five, with the Leafs winning both times. Captain Syl 
Apps had won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy that season, not taking one 
penalty and finishing his ten-season career with an average of 5 minutes, 
36 seconds in penalties a season. Goalie Turk Broda shut out the Wings 
in game six, and Sweeney Schriner scored two goals in the third period 
to win the seventh game 3–1. Apps told writer Trent Frayne in 1949, "If 
you want me to be pinned down to my [biggest night in hockey but also my] 
biggest second, I'd say it was the last tick of the clock that sounded 
the final bell. It's something I shall never forget at all." It was the 
first time a major pro sports team had come back from 3–0 to win a best-of-seven 
championship series. Three years later, with their heroes from 1942 dwindling 
(due to either age, health or the War), the Leafs turned to lesser-known 
players such as rookie goaltender Frank McCool and defenceman Babe Pratt. 
They upset the Red Wings in the 1945 Finals. The powerful defending champion 
Montreal Canadiens and their "Punch Line" (consisting of Maurice "Rocket" 
Richard, Toe Blake and Elmer Lach), were the Leafs' nemesis two years later 
when the two teams clashed in the 1947 Finals. Ted "Teeder" Kennedy scored 
the game-winning goal late in Game 6 to win the Leafs their first of three-straight 
Cups, an NHL first. With their victory in 1948, the Leafs moved ahead of 
Montreal for the most Stanley Cups in League history. It would take the 
Canadiens ten years to reclaim the record. The Maple Leafs and Canadiens 
met again in the finals in 1951, with five consecutive overtime games. 
Tod Sloan scored with 42 seconds left in the third period of game five 
to tie, and defenceman Bill Barilko, who had scored only six goals in the 
regular season, scored the game-winner. Barilko's glory was short-lived: 
he disappeared in a plane crash near Timmins, Ontario, barely four months 
later. The Leafs won no more Cups that decade. Before the 1961–62 season, 
Smythe sold nearly all of his shares in Maple Leaf Gardens to a partnership 
composed of his son Stafford Smythe, newspaper baron John Bassett and Toronto 
Marlboros President Harold Ballard. The sale price was $2.3 million, a 
handsome return on Smythe's original investment 34 years earlier. Conn 
later claimed that he knew nothing about his son's partners, but it is 
very unlikely that he could have believed Stafford had raised the money 
on his own. Under the new ownership, Toronto won another three-straight 
Stanley Cups from 1962 to 1964. The team featured Hall of Famers Frank 
Mahovlich, Red Kelly, Johnny Bower, Dave Keon, Andy Bathgate and Tim Horton, 
and was helmed by coach and general manager Punch Imlach. In 1967, the 
Leafs and Canadiens met in the Cup finals for the last time to date. Montreal 
was considered to be a heavy favourite, but Bob Pulford scored the double-overtime 
winner in Game 3, Jim Pappin got the series winner in Game 6. Keon won 
the Conn Smythe playoff Most Valuable Player. As of 2016, the Leafs had 
not won the Stanley Cup (nor even made the Finals) since. In 1968, Mahovlich 
was traded to Detroit in a blockbuster deal, and in 1969, following a first-round 
playoff loss to the Bruins, Smythe fired Imlach. Horton declared, "If this 
team doesn't want Imlach, I guess it doesn't want me."[citation needed] 
He was traded to the New York Rangers the next year. Following Stafford 
Smythe's death, Harold Ballard bought his shares to take control. Ballard's 
controversial term as the Leafs' owner was marked by several disputes with 
prominent players, including Keon, Lanny McDonald, and Darryl Sittler, 
poor win/loss records and no championships. During the 1970s, the overall 
talent level in the League was diluted by the addition of 12 franchises 
and the birth of the rival World Hockey Association (WHA). The Leafs iced 
their competition for several seasons. However, despite the presence of 
stars such as Sittler, McDonald, Dave "Tiger" Williams, Ian Turnbull and 
Borje Salming, they only once made it past the second playoff round, besting 
the New York Islanders (a future dynasty) in the 1978 quarters only to 
be swept by arch-rival Montreal in the semis. One of the few highlights 
from this era occurred on February 7, 1976, when Sittler scored six goals 
and four assists against Boston to establish a NHL single-game points record 
that still stood more than 30 years later. The serious decline started 
in July 1979, when Ballard brought back Imlach, a long-time friend, as 
general manager. Imlach traded McDonald to undermine Imlach's friend Sittler's 
influence on the team.[15] Sittler himself was gone two years later, when 
the Leafs traded him to the Philadelphia Flyers. He was the franchise's 
all-time leading scorer until Mats Sundin passed him in 2007. The McDonald 
trade sent the Leafs into a downward spiral. They finished five games under 
.500 and barely made the playoffs. For the next 12 years, the Leafs (who 
had shifted to the Norris Division for the 1981–82 season) were barely 
competitive, not posting another winning record until 1992–93. They missed 
the playoffs six times and finished above fourth in their division only 
once (in 1990, the only season where they won even half their games). They 
made it beyond the first round of the playoffs twice (in 1986 and 1987, 
advancing to the division finals). The low point came in 1984–85, when 
they finished 32 games under .500, the second-worst record in franchise 
history (their .300 winning percentage was only 22 percentage points higher 
than the 1918–19 Arenas). The Leafs' poor showing resulted in several high 
draft picks. Future captain Wendel Clark, the first overall pick in the 
1985 NHL Entry Draft, was the lone success from the group. Ballard died 
in 1990, and Steve Stavro, Don Crump and Don Giffin were executors of his 
estate. Stavro succeeded Ballard as chairman of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. 
and governor of the Maple Leafs. Calgary Flames General Manager Cliff Fletcher, 
who had crafted the Flames' 1989 championship team, was hired by Don Giffin 
to run the team against the objections of Stavro, who told Fletcher directly 
that he wanted to install his own man.[16] Fletcher immediately set about 
building a competitive club, making a series of trades and free agent acquisitions 
which turned the Leafs from an also-ran into a contender almost overnight, 
starting in 1992–93. Outstanding play from forwards Doug Gilmour (a Calgary 
acquaintance of Fletcher's) and Dave Andreychuk (acquired from the Buffalo 
Sabres in exchange for Grant Fuhr), as well as stellar goaltending from 
minor league call-up Felix Potvin, led the team to a then-franchise-record 
99 points, third place in the Norris Division, and the eighth-best overall 
record in the NHL. Toronto dispatched the Detroit Red Wings in seven games 
in the first round, then defeated the St. Louis Blues in another seven 
games in the Division Finals. Hoping to meet long-time rival Montreal (who 
was playing in the Wales Conference Finals against the New York Islanders) 
in the Cup Finals, the Leafs faced the Los Angeles Kings in the Campbell 
Conference Finals. The Leafs led the series 3–2, but dropped Game 6 in 
Los Angeles. The game was not without controversy, as Wayne Gretzky clipped 
Gilmour in the face with his stick, but referee Kerry Fraser did not call 
a penalty and Gretzky scored the winning goal moments later.[17] Gretzky's 
hat-trick in Game 7 finished the Leafs. The Leafs had another strong season 
in 1993–94, finishing with 98 points, good enough for fifth overall in 
the League, their highest finish in 16 years. However, despite finishing 
one point above Calgary, Toronto was seeded third in the Western Conference 
(formerly the Campbell Conference) by virtue of the Flames' Pacific Division 
title. The Leafs eliminated divisional rival Chicago Blackhawks in six 
games and the San Jose Sharks in seven before falling to the Vancouver 
Canucks in five games in the Western Conference Finals. At that year's 
draft, the Leafs packaged Clark in a trade with the Quebec Nordiques that 
landed them Mats Sundin. In 1996, Stavro took on Larry Tanenbaum, cofounder 
of Toronto's new National Basketball Association (NBA) team, the Toronto 
Raptors, as a partner. Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. was accordingly renamed 
Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE), to be the parent company of the 
two teams. MLSE has expanded since then, adding the Toronto Marlies (the 
Leafs' farm team) of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Toronto FC 
of Major League Soccer (MLS) to its stable. After two years out of the 
playoffs in the late 1990s, the Leafs made two transactions for the upcoming 
1998–99 season. They acquired goaltender Curtis Joseph as a free agent 
from the Edmonton Oilers and hired Pat Quinn, who had been fired by Vancouver 
in 1997, to serve as head coach. The Leafs were also moved from the Western 
to the Eastern Conference as part of a League realignment. In January 1999, 
the team moved from its longtime home Maple Leaf Gardens to the new Air 
Canada Centre, shared with the Raptors. During the 1999 playoffs, the team 
eliminated the Philadelphia Flyers and Pittsburgh Penguins in the first 
two rounds of the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Buffalo Sabres 
in the Eastern Conference Finals. Nonetheless it was their best post-season 
finish since their back-to-back Conference Finals appearances in 1993 and 
1994. In the 1999–2000 season, the Leafs hosted the mid-season All-Star 
Game, where Wayne Gretzky's jersey number 99 was retired League-wide. They 
compiled their first 100-point season and captured their first division 
title in 37 years. The 2000–01 regular season was less successful, however, 
as the Leafs could only clinch the seventh seed in their conference. In 
both of the 2000 and 2001 playoffs, the Leafs defeated the Ottawa Senators 
in the first round and lost to the New Jersey Devils in the second round. 
In 2000, the Leafs were limited to six shots as they lost the deciding 
Game 6 by a 3–0 scoreline, and in 2001 (after sweeping the Senators who 
were seeded second), the Leafs held a 3–2 series lead over the Devils but 
lost Game 6, 4–2, and Game 7, 5–1. In 2002, the Leafs dispatched the Islanders 
and their Ontario rivals, the Senators, in the first two rounds, only to 
lose to the Cinderella-story Carolina Hurricanes in the Conference Finals. 
The 2002 season was particularly impressive in that injuries sidelined 
many of their better players, but the efforts of lesser-known players, 
mainly Gary Roberts and Alyn McCauley, led them to the Conference Finals. 
Joseph joined the defending champion Red Wings in the 2002 off-season, 
though the Maple Leafs quickly found a replacement in free agent Ed Belfour, 
who signed from the Dallas Stars and had been a crucial part of their 1999 
Stanley Cup run. Belfour played well during the regular season and was 
a finalist for the Vezina Trophy, though in the 2003 playoffs, the Leafs 
lost to Philadelphia in seven games during the first round. The year 2003 
witnessed an ownership change, as Stavro sold his controlling interest 
in MLSE to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and resigned his position 
as chairman of the board in favour of Larry Tanenbaum; Stavro later died 
in 2006. Pat Quinn remained as head coach but was replaced as general manager 
by a young John Ferguson Jr. The 2003–04 season started in an uncommon 
way for the team, as they held their training camp in Sweden and played 
in the NHL Challenge against teams from Sweden and Finland. The Leafs went 
on to enjoy a very successful regular season, leading the NHL at the time 
of the All-Star Game (resulting in Quinn being named head coach of the 
East's All-Star Team) and eventually posting a franchise-record 103 points. 
They finished with the fourth-best record in the League, their highest 
overall finish in 41 years, achieving a .628 win percentage, their best 
in 43 years and third-best in franchise history. Toronto then defeated 
the Senators in the first round of the post-season for the fourth time 
in five years, with Ed Belfour posting three shutouts (setting the record 
for the most shutouts in a single playoff series) in seven games, but lost 
to the Flyers in six games during the second round. Following the 2004–05 
NHL lockout, the Maple Leafs experienced very rough times. They struggled 
in 2005–06, and despite a late-season surge (9–1–2 in their final 12 games), 
led by third-string goaltender Jean-Sebastien Aubin, Toronto was out of 
playoff contention for the first time since 1998. This marked the first 
time that the team had missed under Head Coach Pat Quinn, who was subsequently 
fired after the season. Quinn's dismissal was controversial, since many 
of the young players that were key contributors to the Leaf's late-season 
run were drafted by Quinn prior to Ferguson's arrival, all while Ferguson's 
signings (Eric Lindros, Jason Allison, Alexander Khavanov and Ed Belfour) 
had suffered season-ending injuries.[18] Paul Maurice, an experienced NHL 
coach who had just inaugurated the American Hockey League (AHL)'s Toronto 
Marlies, was announced as Pat Quinn's replacement. On June 30, 2006, the 
Maple Leafs bought-out the contract of long-time fan favourite Tie Domi. 
In addition to Domi, the Maple Leafs also decided against picking up the 
option year on the contract of goaltender Ed Belfour. Both players became 
free agents on July 1. However, despite the coaching change and addition 
of new players such as Pavel Kubina and Michael Peca, the Maple Leafs again 
did not make the playoffs in 2006–07. For 2007–08, Toronto added Jason 
Blake and Vesa Toskala, while veterans Jeff O'Neill and Jean-Sebastien 
Aubin departed. Midway through the season, on January 22, 2008, General 
Manager John Ferguson, Jr., was fired and was replaced by former Maple 
Leafs GM Cliff Fletcher on an interim basis.[19] The Leafs again failed 
to qualify for the post-season, their first triple miss since before even 
the days of the Maple Leaf Gardens. It was also Mats Sundin's last year 
with the Leafs, as his contract was due to expire at the end of the season; 
he refused, however, Leaf management's request to waive his no-trade clause 
in order for the team to rebuilt by acquiring potential young talent and/or 
draft picks.[20] On May 7, the Leafs fired Head Coach Paul Maurice and 
Assistant Coach Randy Ladouceur, and replaced them with former San Jose 
Sharks Head Coach Ron Wilson and assistants Tim Hunter and Rob Zettler.[21] 
On November 29, 2008, the Maple Leafs hired Brian Burke as their 13th non-interim 
and first American general manager in team history. The acquisition ended 
the second Cliff Fletcher era and settled persistent rumours that Burke 
was coming to Toronto.[22] On June 26, 2009, Burke made his first appearance 
as the Leafs GM at the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, selecting London Knights forward 
Nazem Kadri with the seventh overall pick.[23] On September 18, 2009, Burke 
traded Toronto's first- and second-round 2010, as well as its 2011 first-rounder, 
to the Boston Bruins in exchange for forward Phil Kessel.[24] On January 
31, 2010, the Maple Leafs made another high-profile trade, this time with 
the Calgary Flames in a seven-player deal that brought defenceman Dion 
Phaneuf to Toronto.[25] On June 14, during the season's subsequent off-season, 
the Maple Leafs then named Phaneuf as captain after two seasons without 
a captain following Sundin's departure.[26] On February 18, 2011, the Leafs 
sent long-time Maple Leaf Tomas Kaberle to the Bruins in exchange for prospect 
Joe Colborne, Boston's first-round pick in 2011 and a conditional second-round 
draft choice.[27] On March 2, 2012, Burke fired Head Coach Ron Wilson and 
named Randy Carlyle, a Stanley Cup winner with the Anaheim Ducks in 2007, 
as his replacement. The termination proved to be controversial, however, 
as Wilson had received a contract extension just two months prior to being 
let go.[28] On January 9, 2013, Burke himself was fired as general manager, 
replaced by Dave Nonis.[29] In their first full season under the leadership 
of Carlyle, Toronto managed to secure a playoff berth in the shortened 
2012–13 season for the first time in eight years, clinching their 2013 
post-season appearance after a 4–1 victory on April 20, 2013, over provincial 
rivals Ottawa. The Leafs, however, lost in seven games to eventual 2013 
Stanley Cup finalists Boston in the first round. Despite the season's success, 
it was not repeated during the 2013–14 season as the Leafs once again failed 
to make the playoffs. Shortly after the end of the 2013–14 regular season, 
NHL Director of Player Safety Brendan Shanahan was named as the president 
and an alternate governor of the Maple Leafs.[30] On January 6, 2015, the 
Maple Leafs fired Carlyle as head coach,[31] with Assistant Coach Peter 
Horachek taking over on an interim basis immediately after the firing. 
While the Maple Leafs had a winning record before Carlyle's firing, the 
team would eventually collapse. On February 6, 2015, the Leafs set a new 
franchise record of 11 consecutive games without a win. Both Dave Nonis 
and Horachek were relieved of their duties on April 12, just one day after 
the team's historically bad regular season concluded. Alongside these departures 
were the firings on coaches Steve Spott, Chris Dennis, Rick St. Croix; 
Director of Player Development Jim Hughes; and Director of Pro Scouting 
Steve Kasper, as well as Rob Cowie and 18 other scouts.[32][33][34][35] 
Later in the day, strength and conditioning coach Anthony Belza and video 
coordinator Adam Jancelewicz were fired. On May 20, 2015, Mike Babcock 
was named as the new head coach, and on June 23, Lou Lamoriello was named 
the 16th GM in team history.[36][37] On July 1, 2015, the Leafs traded 
Phil Kessel, Tyler Biggs, Tim Erixon, and a second round pick to the Pittsburgh 
Penguins for Nick Spaling, Kasperi Kapanen, Scott Harrington, a conditional 
first round pick, and a third round pick. Toronto will also retain $1.2 
million of Kessel’s salary in each of the next seven seasons.[38] On February 
9, 2016, the Leafs traded Captain Dion Phaneuf to the Ottawa Senators alongside 
Matt Frattin, Casey Bailey, Ryan Repert, and Cody Donaghey in exchange 
for Jared Cowen, Colin Greening, Milan Michalek, Tobias Lindberg, and a 
2017 2nd-round pick.[39] The Maple Leafs finished last in the NHL for the 
first time since the 1984–85 season and secured a 20 percent chance at 
winning the first overall pick in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft. They were also 
guaranteed to pick no lower than fourth.[40][41] They subsequently won 
the draft lottery and used the first overall pick to draft Auston Matthews. 
The jersey of the Maple Leafs has a long history and is one of the best-selling 
NHL jerseys among fans.[43] Throughout franchise history, Toronto's uniform 
has had four major incarnations and numerous minor alterations. The original 
1917 blue uniforms featured the letter “T” sometimes on a blue shield. 
The second version came in 1919 when they were renamed the St. Pats and 
wore green uniforms with “Toronto St. Pats” on the logo, lettered in green 
either on a white “pill” shape or stripes.[10][44] The third major change 
was for the 1927–28 season when the team’s name changed to the Maple Leafs, 
gaining a new logo and returning to the blue uniform. The logo was a 47-point 
maple leaf with "Toronto Maple Leafs" lettered in white. The home jersey 
was blue with alternating thin-thick stripes on the arms, legs and shoulders. 
The road uniform was white with three stripes on the chest and back, waist 
and legs. For 1933–34, the alternating thin-thick stripes were replaced 
with stripes of equal thickness. This would remain as the basic design 
for the next 40 years.[45] Before the next major change came several minor 
changes. In 1937, veins were added to the leaf and "Toronto" curved downwards 
at the ends instead of upwards.[46] In 1942, the 35-point leaf was introduced. 
In 1946, the logo added trimming to the Leaf with a white or blue border, 
while "C" for captain and “A” for alternate captain first appeared on the 
sweaters. In 1947, the "Toronto Maple Leafs" lettering was in red for a 
short time. In 1958, a six-eyelet lace and tie was added to the neck and 
a blue shoulder yoke was added. In 1961, player numbers added appeared 
on the sleeves. The fourth major change came in the 1966–67 season. The 
leaf was changed to a blue 11-point leaf, similar to the leaf on the then-new 
flag of Canada to commemorate the Canadian Centennial.[45] This was followed 
by many minor changes. In 1970, the League required home teams to wear 
white jerseys. Other changes to the sweater removed the arm stripes, extended 
the yoke to the end of the sleeves,[45] added a solid stripe on the waist, 
three stripes on the stockings and a miniature Leaf crest added to shoulders. 
On the logo, the lettering "Toronto" was no longer curved, but parallel 
to the "Maple Leafs" lettering. The thin, blue 11-point maple leaf had 
rounded corners. In 1973, the jersey’s neck was a lace tie-down design, 
and in 1976, the V-neck returned. In 1977, player names were added to the 
away jerseys and in 1979 to the home jerseys, but not until after the Leafs 
were fined by the NHL for refusing to comply with a new rule requiring 
player names on the jerseys.[45][47] Since the early 1990s, fans showed 
interest in past jersey designs. For the 1991–92 season, the Leafs wore 
uniforms that were styled after the "original six" era for some games, 
while for the 1992–93 season, due to enthusiastic fan reaction for the 
previous season's classic uniforms, the first changes to the Leaf uniform 
in over twenty years were made. Two stripes on the arms and waist were 
added. A "TML" logo was added to the shoulder. During the late 1990s, the 
lettering and numbers were taken from the font on the Maple Leafs logo, 
but they gradually returned to block lettering, which they fully integrated 
in the 2010–11 season. When the Reebok Edge uniform system was introduced 
in the 2007–08 season, the tail stripes were absent from the change, but 
returned three years later. In addition, the veined leaf logo returned 
to the uniforms.[43][45][45] On February 2, 2016, the team unveiled a new 
logo that will be adopted for 2016–17 season in honour of its centennial; 
it returns the logo to a form inspired by the earlier designs, with 31 
points to allude to the 1931 opening of Maple Leaf Gardens, and 17 veins 
in reference of its 1917 establishment. 13 of the veins are positioned 
along the top portion in honour of its 13 Stanley Cup victories. The logo 
was subsequently accompanied by a new jersey design that was unveiled during 
the 2016 NHL Entry Draft on June 24, 2016.[42][48][49] The team mascot 
is Carlton the Bear, an anthropomorphic polar bear whose name and number 
(#60) comes from the location of Maple Leaf Gardens at 60 Carlton Street, 
where they played throughout much of their history. During the 25 years 
of the Original Six era, teams played each other 14 times during the regular 
season, and with only four teams continuing into the playoffs, rivalries 
were intense. As one of this era's most successful teams, the Maple Leafs 
established historic rivalries with the two other most successful teams 
of the time, the Montreal Canadiens and Detroit Red Wings.[50] Toronto's 
rivalry with the Montreal Canadiens has been called hockey's greatest.[51] 
The Canadiens have won 24 Stanley Cups, while the Maple Leafs have won 
13, ranking them first and second, respectively. While the rivalry began 
during the NHL's first season, it began in earnest when Toronto General 
Manager Frank J. Selke left his position in 1946 due to a dispute with 
Conn Smythe to become Montreal's general manager, eventually leading the 
Canadiens to six Cups. As of 2009, the two teams had faced each other 15 
times in the playoffs, six in the Finals; Toronto has won four.[52] Although 
the rivalry declined after Toronto defeated Montreal in the 1967 Final, 
it re-emerged in 2007. With one game left in the season, Toronto trailed 
Montreal for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference by only one 
point. Down 5–3 in the second period, the Leafs won 6–5, preventing Montreal 
from taking the spot which enabled the New York Islanders to steal the 
position.[52] The rivalry from the perspective of the Canadiens fan is 
perhaps most famously captured in the popular Canadian short story "The 
Hockey Sweater" by Roch Carrier. Originally published in French as "Une 
abominable feuille d'érable sur la glace" ("An abominable maple leaf on 
the ice"), it referred to the Maple Leafs sweater his mother forced a boy 
to wear. The boy is presumably based on Carrier himself when he was young. 
This rivalry is also evident in Toronto's College subway station, which 
displays murals depicting the two teams, each one on each platform. While 
the Toronto–Montreal rivalry is one of the most famous in sport,[52] the 
rivalry with the Red Wings was no less intense. This rivalry dates to the 
1920s. As of 1997, they had had 23 playoff meetings, five in the Finals. 
So fierce was the rivalry that when the New York Rangers reached the Finals 
against Detroit in 1950, but could not play in their home rink, Madison 
Square Garden, because the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus were 
in town, they arranged to play home games in Toronto, whose fans hated 
the Red Wings.[53] The rivalry heightened to a fever pitch due to an incident 
in the 1950 playoffs when Detroit's young star, Gordie Howe, mistimed a 
check on Toronto's Ted Kennedy and fell head-first into the boards, suffering 
severe injuries and needed emergency surgery to save his life. While Kennedy 
was exonerated by the NHL, Detroit management and fans accused him of deliberately 
injuring Howe. The result was a violent playoff series and increased animosity 
between the teams.[54] The teams' proximity to each other — Toronto and 
Detroit are approximately 380 kilometres (240 mi) apart via Ontario Highway 
401 — and a number of shared fans (particularly in markets such as Windsor, 
Ontario) added to the rivalry. After the Leafs moved to the Eastern Conference 
in 1998, they faced each other less often, and the rivalry was more often 
found in the stands than on the ice. The 2013 NHL Winter Classic would 
have been played between the Red Wings and the Maple Leafs at Michigan 
Stadium on January 1, 2013.[55] However, it has been postponed to January 
1, 2014, due to the 2012–13 NHL lockout. The Leafs defeated the Red Wings 
in a penalty shootout with a final score of 3–2 in that game. The rivalry 
became intradivisional once again in the 2013–14 season, when Detroit moved 
into the Eastern Conference as part of the NHL's realignment. The rivalry 
between the Leafs and the modern Ottawa Senators, known as the Battle of 
Ontario, heated up during the late 1990s, owing to the Canadiens' struggles 
during that period. The Leafs have won all four post-season series, including 
one four-game sweep. The rivalry diminished after the 2004–05 lockout, 
owing largely to Toronto's failure to make the post-season for seven straight 
seasons.[56] The team's first home was the Arena Gardens, later known as 
the Mutual Street Arena, located at Mutual and Shuter Streets. From 1912 
until 1931, the Arena was ice hockey's premier site in Toronto.[57] The 
Arena Gardens was the third arena in Canada to feature a mechanically-frozen, 
or "artificial," ice surface and for 11 years was the only such facility 
in Eastern Canada.[58] In 1931, over a six-month period, Conn Smythe built 
Maple Leaf Gardens at a cost of C$1.5 million (C$23.2 million in 2016).[59] 
One of hockey's temples, it was the home arena for the team up until 1999. 
Located on the northwest corner of Carlton Street and Church Street, it 
acquired the nickname the "Carlton Street Cashbox," since the games were 
constantly sold out. The Leafs won 11 Stanley Cups from 1932 to 1967 whilst 
playing at the Gardens.[60] Another significant hockey event at the Gardens 
was an Ace Bailey All-Star Game in 1934 as a benefit for Maple Leafs forward 
Ace Bailey, who had suffered a career-ending head injury. The first annual 
NHL All-Star Game was also held at Maple Leaf Gardens in 1947. On February 
20, 1999, the first Maple Leafs game took place at Air Canada Centre (ACC). 
Air Canada Centre is a multi-purpose indoor entertainment arena located 
on Bay Street in Downtown Toronto.[61] It is shared with the National Basketball 
Association (NBA)'s Toronto Raptors, which shares common ownership with 
the Maple Leafs under Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE). Besides 
the ACC, the Maple Leafs have a practice facility at the MasterCard Centre 
for Hockey Excellence. Opened in 2009, it was built on the site of the 
former Lakeshore Lions Arena (circa 1951). The practice facility has three 
NHL rinks and one Olympic-sized rink and is operated by the local Lions 
Club.[62] References to the Maple Leafs have been very common in Canadian 
movies and television shows, as well as in radio and literature. In 1946, 
the comedy team of Wayne and Shuster performed a sketch on their CBC radio 
program in which the imaginary hockey team, the Mimico Mice, competed against 
the Maple Leafs. Foster Hewitt did the play-by-play of the game, real Maple 
Leaf player names were used for the Leafs and Wayne and Shuster played 
the entire Mimico team.[63] In 1949, Foster Hewitt wrote a juvenile hockey 
novel, He Shoots, he scores!, which featured the team, including actual 
managers and players.[64] In 1963, Scott Young wrote A Boy at the Leafs' 
Camp, a children's book giving a behind-the-scenes insight into the sport.[65] 
In 1971, Young and George Robertson cowrote an adult hockey-romance novel, 
Face-off, about the experiences of a star rookie player, Billy Duke, with 
the Maple Leafs.[66] The novel became a movie in 1971 with Art Hindle as 
Billy Duke. The film featured many of the players. Jim McKenny, body-doubled 
for Hindle for the on-ice action scenes due to a resemblance to Hindle. 
Owner Ballard had a part as the team doctor.[67] In 1979, Roch Carrier 
wrote the short story The Hockey Sweater about a young boy who was forced 
to wear the hated Maple Leafs sweater instead of his beloved Montreal Canadiens 
sweater by his mother, who had given it to him as a present. In 1980, the 
story was turned into an animated short by the National Film Board of Canada.[68] 
In 1992, Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip released the song "Fifty 
Mission Cap," which memorialized Bill Barilko.[69] The 1993 film Gross 
Misconduct was about the life of former Maple Leaf Brian Spencer.[70] Comedian 
Mike Myers, a fan, often included references and even an entire plot line 
in his films. In Austin Powers in Goldmember, the ticker below the news 
item on a television reads, "Maple Leafs win Stanley Cup." In another scene, 
the character Mini-Me wears a Maple Leaf sweater.[71] Myers played a guru 
hired to help the Maple Leafs' star player in the movie The Love Guru.[72] 
At the beginning of the 2010 spy film Fair Game, CIA agent Valerie Plame 
is being questioned by a suspicious weapons trafficker. He asks her if 
she is an American, and after responding that she is Canadian, he asks 
her about the Maple Leafs. She replies that she is not a fan.[73] Maple 
Leafs home games have long been one of the toughest tickets to acquire 
even during losing seasons.[74] Maple Leaf Gardens sold out every game 
from 1946 until the building closed in 1999.[60] In 2008, there was a waiting 
list of about 2,500 names for season tickets. With an average of US$1.9 
million per game, the Leafs had the highest average ticket revenue per 
game in the 2007–08 season; the previous season they earned about $1.5 
million per game.[75] Maple Leaf fans are loyal despite poor rewards—in 
a 2014 survey by ESPN The Magazine, the Leafs were ranked last out of the 
122 professional teams in the Big Four leagues. Teams were graded by stadium 
experience, ownership, player quality, ticket affordability, championships 
won and "bang for the buck"; in particular, the Leafs came last in ticket 
affordability and second-last in championships won or expected.[76] Conversely, 
fans of other teams harbour an equally passionate dislike of the team. 
In November 2002, the Leafs were named by Sports Illustrated hockey writer 
Michael Farber as the "Most Hated Team in Hockey."[77] A large number of 
Leaf fans live in the Ottawa Valley and in the Niagara region. As a result, 
Leafs-Senators games at the Canadian Tire Centre (formerly the Scotiabank 
Place and originally the Corel Centre) in Ottawa and Leafs-Sabres games 
at the KeyBank Center in Buffalo are more neutral (50–50) due to the large 
influx of Leaf fans, due in part to those cities' proximity to Toronto 
and the relatively greater ease in getting tickets to those teams' games 
(particularly in Buffalo, where fan-friendly ownership kept ticket prices 
relatively low). Despite Toronto's usual loyal fan base, however, there 
were several occurrences in the 2014–15 season where fans threw Leafs jerseys 
onto the ice to show disapproval of the team's poor performances in the 
past few decades.[78] Similarly, during the late-regular season that overlaps 
with the opening baseball season, fans have also been heard sarcastically 
chanting "Let's go Blue Jays!" as a sign of their shift in priority.[79][80][81] 
As a result of both Bell Canada and Rogers Communications having an ownership 
stake in MLSE, Leafs broadcasts are split between these two media companies. 
Radio broadcasts are split evenly between Rogers' CJCL (Sportsnet 590, 
The Fan) and Bell's CHUM (TSN Radio 1050), and regional TV broadcasts are 
split between Rogers' Sportsnet Ontario and Bell's TSN4.[82] Prior to the 
2014–15 season, Leafs TV, a regional specialty channel directly owned by 
MLSE, also aired selected regional games. Note: GP = Games played, W =

have retired 13 numbers to date,.[85] Between October 17, 1992 - October 
15, 2016, the Maple Leafs took a unique approach to "retired numbers". 
Whilst players who suffered a career ending injury had their numbers retired, 
"great" players had their number "honoured". This meant that, although 
it hung from the rafters, the number was still in team circulation, and 
thus could be worn by other players. During this period, only 2 players 
met the criteria, the first being the #6 worn by Ace Bailey on February 
14, 1934, with Bill Barilko's #5 following on October 17, 1992.[86] Bailey 
holds the distinction of being the first player in NHL history to have 
their number retired. Alongside the 2 retired numbers were 10 honoured 
numbers for 16 players; the first players to receive this treatment were 
Syl Apps and Ted Kennedy, on October 3, 1993, while Mats Sundin was the 
last player to receive this treatment on February 11, 2012. On October 
15, 2016, prior to the home opening game of the team's centenary season, 
it was announced that the Maple Leafs had changed their philosophy on retiring 
numbers, and that the numbers of those 16 honoured players would henceforth 
be retired, in addition to the retirement of Dave Keon's number.[87] Notes
