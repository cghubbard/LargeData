The 1902 Philadelphia Phillies season was a season in American baseball. 
The team finished seventh in the National League with a record of 56â€“81, 
46 games behind the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1902, the Phillies obtained 
an injunction, effective only in Pennsylvania, barring Nap Lajoie from 
playing baseball for any team other than the Phillies.[2] The American 
League responded by transferring Lajoie's contract to the Cleveland Indians, 
then known as the Bronchos and subsequently renamed the "Naps" in Lajoie's 
honor for several seasons. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Note:
