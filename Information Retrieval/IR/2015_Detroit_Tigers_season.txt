The 2015 Detroit Tigers season was the team's 115th season, and their 16th 
season at Comerica Park. This season saw the release of President and General 
Manager Dave Dombrowski, who had been with the team since 2002. In a season 
plagued by injuries to star players Justin Verlander, Víctor Martínez, 
Miguel Cabrera, José Iglesias, and Aníbal Sánchez, the Tigers finished 
in last place in their division with a 74–87 record, had their first losing 
season since 2008, and failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 
2010. The Tigers sent four players to the 2015 All-Star Game. First baseman 
Miguel Cabrera was voted in as the starter at first base in the fan voting, 
while shortstop José Iglesias, outfielder J. D. Martinez and pitcher David 
Price were selected as reserves in the player voting. Cabrera did not participate 
in the All-Star game due to a left calf strain.[78] The Tigers had a chance 
to send a fifth player to the All-Star Game this season, as outfielder 
Yoenis Céspedes was one of the five finalists for the AL in the All-Star 
Final Vote, but he was beaten out by Mike Moustakas of the Kansas City 
Royals.[79][80] Price became the winning pitcher of the game, marking the 
second consecutive All-Star game that featured a Tiger as the winning pitcher, 
following Max Scherzer who won in 2014.[81] Infielders Outfielders Coaches
