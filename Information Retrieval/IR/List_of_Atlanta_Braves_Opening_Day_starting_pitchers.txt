The Atlanta Braves are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in 
Atlanta. They play in the National League East division. They were based 
in Milwaukee and Boston before moving to Atlanta for the 1966 season.[1] 
The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening 
Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often 
given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season,[2] 
though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might 
not start on Opening Day.[3] The Atlanta Braves have used 19 different 
Opening Day starting pitchers in their 47 seasons in Atlanta. The 19 starters 
have a combined Opening Day record of 14 wins, 20 losses and 13 no decisions.[4] 
No decisions are only awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won 
or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game.[5] Hall of Famer 
Phil Niekro holds the Atlanta Braves' record for most Opening Day starts, 
with eight. He has a record in Opening Day starts for the Braves of no wins 
and six losses with two no decisions. Greg Maddux had seven Opening Day 
starts for the team and Rick Mahler had five. Tom Glavine and John Smoltz 
have each made four Opening Day starts for the Braves. Maddux has the record 
for most wins in Atlanta Braves Opening Day starts, with five. Mahler has 
the highest winning percentage in Opening Day starts (1.000), with four wins 
and no losses with one no decision. All of Mahler's four victories were 
shutouts, including three in consecutive years (1985 to 1987) by identical 
scores of 6–0. Niekro has the record for most losses in Atlanta Braves 
Opening Day starts, with six.[4] From 1972 through 1980, the Braves lost 
nine consecutive Opening Day games. In those games, their starting pitchers 
had a record of no wins, six losses and three no decisions. Niekro had 
five of the losses during this streak, and Carl Morton had the other. Morton, 
Gary Gentry and Andy Messersmith had no decisions during the streak. One 
of the most famous Opening Day games in baseball history occurred during 
this stretch. That was the game on April 4, 1974, against the Cincinnati 
Reds at Riverfront Stadium, when Hank Aaron hit his 714th career home run 
to tie Babe Ruth's all-time record. Carl Morton was Atlanta's starting 
pitcher for that game, and received a no decision.[4][6][7] Overall, Atlanta 
Braves' Opening Day starting pitchers have a record of 4–5 with four no 
decisions at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, their original home ball park 
in Atlanta and a 3–3 record with one no decision at their current home 
park, Turner Field. This gives the Atlanta Braves' Opening Day starting 
pitchers a combined home record 7–8 with five no decisions. Their away 
record is 7–12 with eight no decisions. The Braves went on to play in the 
World Series in 1991, 1992, 1995, 1996 and 1999, and won the 1995 World 
Series championship games. John Smoltz was the Opening Day starting pitcher 
in 1991, Tom Glavine in 1992 and 1999, and Greg Maddux in 1995 and 1996. 
They had a combined Opening Day record of 3–2 in years that the Atlanta 
Braves played in the World Series.[4] "Atlanta Braves Opening Day Starters
