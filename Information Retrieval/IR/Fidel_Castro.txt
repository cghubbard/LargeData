Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz (American Spanish: [fiˈðel aleˈxandɾo ˈkastɾo 
ˈrus]  audio (help·info); born August 13, 1926), commonly known as Fidel 
Castro, is a Cuban politician and revolutionary who governed the Republic 
of Cuba as Prime Minister from 1959 to 1976 and then as President from 
1976 to 2008. Politically a Marxist–Leninist and Cuban nationalist, he 
also served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba from 
1961 until 2011. Under his administration Cuba became a one-party communist 
state; industry and business were nationalized, and state socialist reforms 
implemented throughout society. Born in Birán as the son of a wealthy farmer, 
Castro adopted leftist anti-imperialist politics while studying law at 
the University of Havana. After participating in rebellions against right-wing 
governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia, he planned the overthrow 
of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, launching a failed attack on the 
Moncada Barracks in 1953. After a year's imprisonment, he traveled to Mexico 
where he formed a revolutionary group, the 26th of July Movement, with 
his brother Raúl Castro and Che Guevara. Returning to Cuba, Castro took 
a key role in the Cuban Revolution by leading the Movement in a guerrilla 
war against Batista's forces from the Sierra Maestra. After Batista's overthrow 
in 1959, Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba's Prime Minister. 
The United States was alarmed by Castro's friendly relations with the Soviet 
Union, and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by assassination, economic 
blockade, and counter-revolution, including the Bay of Pigs invasion of 
1961. Countering these threats, Castro formed an alliance with the Soviets 
and allowed them to place nuclear weapons on the island, sparking the Cuban 
Missile Crisis—a defining incident of the Cold War—in 1962. Adopting a 
Marxist-Leninist model of development, Castro converted Cuba into a one-party 
socialist state under Communist Party rule, the first in the Western hemisphere. 
Reforms introducing central economic planning and expanding healthcare 
and education were accompanied by state control of the press and the suppression 
of internal dissent. Abroad, Castro supported anti-imperialist revolutionary 
groups, backing the establishment of Marxist governments in Chile, Nicaragua, 
and Grenada, and sending troops to aid allies in the Yom Kippur War, Ethio-Somali 
War, and Angolan Civil War. These actions, coupled with Castro's leadership 
of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1979–83 and Cuba's medical internationalism, 
increased Cuba's profile on the world stage and earned its leader great 
respect in the developing world. Following the Soviet Union's dissolution 
in 1991, Castro led Cuba into its "Special Period" and embraced environmentalist 
and anti-globalization ideas. In the 2000s he forged alliances in the Latin 
American Pink Tide—namely with Hugo Chávez's Venezuela—and signed Cuba 
to the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. In 2006 he transferred his 
responsibilities to Vice-President Raúl Castro, who formally assumed the 
presidency in 2008. Castro is a controversial and divisive world figure. 
He is decorated with various international awards, and his supporters laud 
him as a champion of socialism, anti-imperialism, and humanitarianism, 
whose revolutionary regime secured Cuba's independence from American imperialism. 
Conversely, critics view him as a totalitarian dictator whose administration 
oversaw multiple human-rights abuses, an exodus of more than one million 
Cubans, and the impoverishment of the country's economy. Through his actions 
and his writings he has significantly influenced the politics of various 
individuals and groups across the world. Castro was born out of wedlock 
at his father's farm on August 13, 1926.[1] His father, Ángel Castro y 
Argiz, was a migrant to Cuba from Galicia, Northwest Spain.[2] He had become 
financially successful by growing sugar cane at Las Manacas farm in Birán, 
Oriente Province,[3] and after the collapse of his first marriage, he took 
his household servant, Lina Ruz González - also of Spanish origin, as his 
mistress and later on second wife; together they had seven children, among 
them Fidel.[4] Aged six, Castro was sent to live with his teacher in Santiago 
de Cuba,[5] before being baptized into the Roman Catholic Church aged eight.[6] 
Being baptized enabled Castro to attend the La Salle boarding school in 
Santiago, where he regularly misbehaved, and so was sent to the privately 
funded, Jesuit-run Dolores School in Santiago.[7] In 1945 he transferred 
to the more prestigious Jesuit-run El Colegio de Belén in Havana.[8] Although 
Castro took an interest in history, geography and debating at Belén, he 
did not excel academically, instead devoting much of his time to playing 
sport.[9] In 1945, Castro began studying law at the University of Havana.[10] 
Admitting he was "politically illiterate", he became embroiled in student 
activism,[11] and the violent gangsterismo culture within the university.[12] 
Passionate about anti-imperialism and opposing U.S. intervention in the 
Caribbean,[13] he unsuccessfully campaigned for the presidency of the Federation 
of University Students on a platform of "honesty, decency and justice".[14] 
Castro became critical of the corruption and violence of President Ramón 
Grau's government, delivering a public speech on the subject in November 
1946 that received coverage on the front page of several newspapers.[15] 
In 1947, Castro joined the Party of the Cuban People (Partido Ortodoxo), 
founded by veteran politician Eduardo Chibás. A charismatic figure, Chibás 
advocated social justice, honest government, and political freedom, while 
his party exposed corruption and demanded reform. Though Chibás lost the 
election, Castro remained committed to working on his behalf.[16] Student 
violence escalated after Grau employed gang leaders as police officers, 
and Castro soon received a death threat urging him to leave the university; 
refusing, he began carrying a gun and surrounding himself with armed friends.[17] 
In later years anti-Castro dissidents accused him of committing gang-related 
assassinations at the time, but these remain unproven.[18] I joined the 
people; I grabbed a rifle in a police station that collapsed when it was 
rushed by a crowd. I witnessed the spectacle of a totally spontaneous revolution... 
[T]hat experience led me to identify myself even more with the cause of 
the people. My still incipient Marxist ideas had nothing to do with our 
conduct – it was a spontaneous reaction on our part, as young people with 
Martí-an, anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist and pro-democratic ideas. 
In June 1947, Castro learned of a planned expedition to invade the Dominican 
Republic and overthrow the right-wing military junta of Rafael Trujillo, 
a U.S. ally.[20] Being President of the University Committee for Democracy 
in the Dominican Republic, Castro joined the expedition.[21] The invasion 
force consisted of around 1,200 troops, mostly Cubans and exiled Dominicans, 
and they intended to sail from Cuba in July 1947. However, under U.S. pressure, 
Grau's government stopped the invasion, although Castro and many of his 
comrades evaded arrest.[22] Returning to Havana, Castro took a leading 
role in student protests against the killing of a high school pupil by 
government bodyguards.[23] The protests, accompanied by a crackdown on 
those considered communists, led to violent clashes between activists and 
police in February 1948, in which Castro was badly beaten.[24] At this 
point his public speeches took on a distinctly leftist slant by condemning 
social and economic inequality in Cuba. In contrast, his former public 
criticisms had centered on condemning corruption and U.S. imperialism.[24] 
In April 1948, Castro traveled to Bogotá, Colombia, with a Cuban student 
group sponsored by President Juan Perón's Argentine government. There, 
the assassination of popular leftist leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Ayala 
led to widespread rioting and clashes between the governing Conservatives 
– backed by the army – and leftist Liberals.[25] Castro joined the Liberal 
cause by stealing guns from a police station, but subsequent police investigations 
concluded that he had not been involved in any killings.[25] Returning 
to Cuba, Castro became a prominent figure in protests against government 
attempts to raise bus fares.[26] That year, he married Mirta Díaz Balart, 
a student from a wealthy family through whom he was exposed to the lifestyle 
of the Cuban elite. The relationship was a love match, disapproved of by 
both families, but Mirta's father gave them tens of thousands of dollars 
to spend on a three-month New York City honeymoon.[27] Marxism taught me 
what society was. I was like a blindfolded man in a forest, who doesn't 
even know where north or south is. If you don't eventually come to truly 
understand the history of the class struggle, or at least have a clear 
idea that society is divided between the rich and the poor, and that some 
people subjugate and exploit other people, you're lost in a forest, not 
knowing anything. That same year, Grau decided not to stand for re-election, 
which was instead won by his Partido Auténtico's new candidate, Carlos 
Prío Socarrás.[29] Prío faced widespread protests when members of the MSR, 
now allied to the police force, assassinated Justo Fuentes, a socialist 
friend of Castro's. In response, Prío agreed to quell the gangs, but found 
them too powerful to control.[30] Castro had moved further to the left, 
influenced by the Marxist writings of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and 
Vladimir Lenin. He came to interpret Cuba's problems as an integral part 
of capitalist society, or the "dictatorship of the bourgeoisie", rather 
than the failings of corrupt politicians, and adopted the Marxist view 
that meaningful political change could only be brought about by proletariat 
revolution. Visiting Havana's poorest neighborhoods, he became active in 
the student anti-racist campaign.[31] In September 1949, Mirta gave birth 
to a son, Fidelito, so the couple moved to a larger Havana flat.[32] Castro 
continued to put himself at risk, staying active in the city’s politics 
and joining the September 30 Movement, which contained within it both communists 
and members of the Partido Ortodoxo. The group’s purpose was to oppose 
the influence of the violent gangs within the university; despite his promises, 
Prío had failed to control the situation, instead offering many of their 
senior members jobs in government ministries.[33] Castro volunteered to 
deliver a speech for the Movement on November 13, exposing the government’s 
secret deals with the gangs and identifying key members. Attracting the 
attention of the national press, the speech angered the gangs, and Castro 
fled into hiding, first in the countryside and then in the U.S.[34] Returning 
to Havana several weeks later, Castro lay low and focused on his university 
studies, graduating as a Doctor of Law in September 1950.[35] Castro co-founded 
a legal partnership that primarily catered for poor Cubans, although it 
proved a financial failure.[36] Caring little for money or material goods, 
Castro failed to pay his bills; his furniture was repossessed and electricity 
cut off, distressing his wife.[37] He took part in a high-school protest 
in Cienfuegos in November 1950, fighting with police in protest at the 
Education Ministry's ban on student associations; arrested and charged 
for violent conduct, the magistrate dismissed the charges.[38] His hopes 
for Cuba still centered on Chibás and the Partido Ortodoxo, and he was 
present at Chibás' politically motivated suicide in 1951.[39] Seeing himself 
as Chibás' heir, Castro wanted to run for Congress in the June 1952 elections, 
though senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical reputation and refused 
to nominate him.[40] Instead he was nominated as a candidate for the House 
of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and 
began campaigning.[40] The Ortodoxo had considerable support and was predicted 
to do well in the election.[41] During his campaign, Castro met with General 
Fulgencio Batista, the former president who had returned to politics with 
the Unitary Action Party; although both opposing Prío's administration, 
their meeting never got beyond polite generalities.[42] In March 1952, 
Batista seized power in a military coup, with Prío fleeing to Mexico. Declaring 
himself president, Batista cancelled the planned presidential elections, 
describing his new system as "disciplined democracy": Castro, like many 
others, considered it a one-man dictatorship.[43] Batista moved to the 
right, solidifying ties with both the wealthy elite and the United States, 
severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, suppressing trade 
unions and persecuting Cuban socialist groups.[44] Intent on opposing Batista, 
Castro brought several legal cases against the government, but these came 
to nothing, and Castro began thinking of alternate ways to oust the regime.[45] 
In a few hours you will be victorious or defeated, but regardless of the 
outcome – listen well, friends – this Movement will triumph. If you win 
tomorrow, the aspirations of Martí will be fulfilled sooner. If we fail, 
our action will nevertheless set an example for the Cuban people, and from 
the people will arise fresh new men willing to die for Cuba. They will 
pick up our banner and move forward... The people will back us in Oriente 
and in the whole island. As in '68 and '92, here in Oriente we will give 
the first cry of Liberty or Death! Castro formed a group called "The Movement" 
which operated along a clandestine cell system, publishing underground 
newspaper El Acusador (The Accuser), while arming and training anti-Batista 
recruits.[47] From July 1952 they went on a recruitment drive, gaining 
around 1,200 members in a year, the majority from Havana's poorer districts.[48] 
Although a revolutionary socialist, Castro avoided an alliance with the 
communist PSP, fearing it would frighten away political moderates, but 
kept in contact with PSP members like his brother Raúl.[49] Castro stockpiled 
weapons for a planned attack on the Moncada Barracks, a military garrison 
outside Santiago de Cuba, Oriente. Castro's militants intended to dress 
in army uniforms and arrive at the base on July 25, seizing control and 
raiding the armory before reinforcements arrived.[50] Supplied with new 
weaponry, Castro intended to spark a revolution among Oriente's impoverished 
cane cutters and promote further uprisings.[51] Castro's plan emulated 
those of the 19th century Cuban independence fighters who had raided Spanish 
barracks; Castro saw himself as the heir to independence leader José Martí.[52] 
Castro gathered 165 revolutionaries for the mission,[53] ordering his troops 
not to cause bloodshed unless they met armed resistance.[54] The attack 
took place on July 26, 1953, but ran into trouble; 3 of the 16 cars that 
had set out from Santiago failed to get there. Reaching the barracks, the 
alarm was raised, with most of the rebels pinned down by machine gun fire. 
4 were killed before Castro ordered a retreat.[55] The rebels suffered 
6 fatalities and 15 other casualties, whilst the army suffered 19 dead 
and 27 wounded.[56] Meanwhile, some rebels took over a civilian hospital; 
subsequently stormed by government soldiers, the rebels were rounded up, 
tortured and 22 were executed without trial.[57] Accompanied by 19 comrades, 
Castro set out for Gran Piedra in the rugged Sierra Maestra mountains several 
miles to the north, where they could establish a guerrilla base.[58] Responding 
to the attack, Batista's government proclaimed martial law, ordering a 
violent crackdown on dissent, and imposing strict media censorship.[59] 
The government broadcast misinformation about the event, claiming that 
the rebels were communists who had killed hospital patients, although news 
and photographs of the army's use of torture and summary executions in 
Oriente soon spread, causing widespread public and some governmental disapproval.[59] 
Over the following days, the rebels were rounded up; some were executed 
and others – including Castro – transported to a prison north of Santiago.[60] 
Believing Castro incapable of planning the attack alone, the government 
accused Ortodoxo and PSP politicians of involvement, putting 122 defendants 
on trial on September 21 at the Palace of Justice, Santiago.[61] Acting 
as his own defense counsel, Castro cited Martí as the intellectual author 
of the attack and convinced the 3 judges to overrule the army's decision 
to keep all defendants handcuffed in court, proceeding to argue that the 
charge with which they were accused – of "organizing an uprising of armed 
persons against the Constitutional Powers of the State" – was incorrect, 
for they had risen up against Batista, who had seized power in an unconstitutional 
manner.[62] The trial embarrassed the army by revealing that they had tortured 
suspects, after which they tried unsuccessfully to prevent Castro from 
testifying any further, claiming he was too ill.[63] The trial ended on 
October 5, with the acquittal of most defendants; 55 were sentenced to 
prison terms of between 7 months and 13 years. Castro was sentenced on 
October 16, during which he delivered a speech that would be printed under 
the title of History Will Absolve Me.[64] Castro was sentenced to 15 years 
imprisonment in the hospital wing of the Model Prison (Presidio Modelo), 
a relatively comfortable and modern institution on the Isla de Pinos.[65] 
I would honestly love to revolutionize this country from one end to the 
other! I am sure this would bring happiness to the Cuban people. I would 
not be stopped by the hatred and ill will of a few thousand people, including 
some of my relatives, half the people I know, two-thirds of my fellow professionals, 
and four-fifths of my ex-schoolmates Imprisoned with 25 comrades, Castro 
renamed his group the "26th of July Movement" (MR-26-7) in memory of the 
Moncada attack's date, and formed a school for prisoners.[67] He read widely, 
enjoying the works of Marx, Lenin, and Martí but also reading books by 
Freud, Kant, Shakespeare, Munthe, Maugham and Dostoyevsky, analyzing them 
within a Marxist framework.[68] Corresponding with supporters, he maintained 
control over the Movement and organized the publication of History Will 
Absolve Me.[69] Initially permitted a relative amount of freedom within 
the prison, he was locked up in solitary confinement after inmates sang 
anti-Batista songs on a visit by the President in February 1954.[70] Meanwhile, 
Castro's wife Mirta gained employment in the Ministry of the Interior, 
something he discovered through a radio announcement. Appalled, he raged 
that he would rather die "a thousand times" than "suffer impotently from 
such an insult".[71] Both Fidel and Mirta initiated divorce proceedings, 
with Mirta taking custody of their son Fidelito; this angered Castro, who 
did not want his son growing up in a bourgeois environment.[71] In 1954, 
Batista's government held presidential elections, but no politician stood 
against him; the election was widely considered fraudulent. It had allowed 
some political opposition to be voiced, and Castro's supporters had agitated 
for an amnesty for the Moncada incident's perpetrators. Some politicians 
suggested an amnesty would be good publicity, and the Congress and Batista 
agreed. Backed by the U.S. and major corporations, Batista believed Castro 
to be no threat, and on May 15, 1955, the prisoners were released.[72] 
Returning to Havana, Castro gave radio interviews and press conferences; 
the government closely monitored him, curtailing his activities.[73] Now 
divorced, Castro had sexual affairs with two female supporters, Naty Revuelta 
and Maria Laborde, each conceiving him a child.[74] Setting about strengthening 
the MR-26-7, he established an 11-person National Directorate but retained 
autocratic control, with some dissenters labeling him a caudillo (dictator); 
he argued that a successful revolution could not be run by committee and 
required a strong leader.[75] In 1955, bombings and violent demonstrations 
led to a crackdown on dissent, with Castro and Raúl fleeing the country 
to evade arrest.[76] Castro sent a letter to the press, declaring that 
he was "leaving Cuba because all doors of peaceful struggle have been closed 
to me... As a follower of Martí, I believe the hour has come to take our 
rights and not beg for them, to fight instead of pleading for them."[77] 
The Castros and several comrades traveled to Mexico,[78] where Raúl befriended 
an Argentine doctor and Marxist-Leninist named Ernesto "Che" Guevara. Fidel 
liked him, later describing him as "a more advanced revolutionary than 
I was."[79] Castro also associated with the Spaniard Alberto Bayo, who 
agreed to teach Castro's rebels the necessary skills in guerrilla warfare.[80] 
Requiring funding, Castro toured the U.S. in search of wealthy sympathizers, 
there being monitored by Batista's agents, who allegedly orchestrated a 
failed assassination attempt against him.[81] Castro kept in contact with 
the MR-26-7 in Cuba, where they had gained a large support base in Oriente.[82] 
Other militant anti-Batista groups had sprung up, primarily from the student 
movement; most notable was the Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil (DRE), 
founded by José Antonio Echevarría. Antonio met with Castro in Mexico City, 
but Castro opposed the student's support for indiscriminate assassination.[83] 
After purchasing the decrepit yacht Granma, on November 25, 1956 Castro 
set sail from Tuxpan, Veracruz, with 81 armed revolutionaries.[84] The 
1,200 mile crossing to Cuba was harsh, with food running low and many suffering 
seasickness. At some points, they had to bail water caused by a leak, and 
at another, a man fell overboard, delaying their journey.[85] The plan 
had been for the crossing to take 5 days, and on the Granma’s scheduled 
day of arrival, November 30, MR-26-7 members under Frank Pais led an armed 
uprising in Santiago and Manzanillo. However, the Granma's journey ultimately 
lasted 7 days, and with Castro and his men unable to provide reinforcements, 
Pais and his militants dispersed after two days of intermittent attacks.[86] 
The Granma ran aground in a mangrove swamp at Playa Las Coloradas, close 
to Los Cayuelos, on December 2, 1956. Fleeing inland, its crew headed for 
the forested mountain range of Oriente's Sierra Maestra, being repeatedly 
attacked by Batista's troops.[88] Upon arrival, Castro discovered that 
only 19 rebels had made it to their destination, the rest having been killed 
or captured.[89] Setting up an encampment, the survivors included the Castros, 
Che Guevara, and Camilo Cienfuegos.[90] They began launching raids on small 
army posts to obtain weaponry, and in January 1957 they overran the outpost 
at La Plata, treating any soldiers that they wounded but executing Chicho 
Osorio, the local mayoral (land company overseer), who was despised by 
the local peasants and who boasted of killing one of Castro's rebels.[91] 
Osorio's execution aided the rebels in gaining the trust of locals, although 
they largely remained unenthusiastic and suspicious of the revolutionaries.[92] 
As trust grew, some locals joined the rebels, although most new recruits 
came from urban areas.[93] With volunteers boosting the rebel forces to 
over 200, in July 1957 Castro divided his army into three columns, commanded 
by himself, his brother, and Guevara.[94] The MR-26-7 members operating 
in urban areas continued agitation, sending supplies to Castro, and on 
February 16, 1957 he met with other senior members to discuss tactics; 
here he met Celia Sánchez, who would become a close friend.[95] Across 
Cuba, anti-Batista groups carried out bombings and sabotage; police responded 
with mass arrests, torture, and extrajudicial executions.[96] In March 
1957, the DR launched a failed attack on the presidential palace, during 
which Antonio was shot dead.[96] Frank País was also killed, leaving Castro 
the MR-26-7's unchallenged leader.[97] Although Guevara and Raúl were well 
known for their Marxist-Leninist views, Castro hid his, hoping to gain 
the support of less radical revolutionaries.[98] In 1957 he met with leading 
members of the Partido Ortodoxo, Raúl Chibás and Felipe Pazos, authoring 
the Sierra Maestra Manifesto, in which they demanded that a provisional 
civilian government be set up to implement moderate agrarian reform, industrialization, 
and a literacy campaign before holding multiparty elections.[98] As Cuba's 
press was censored, Castro contacted foreign media to spread his message; 
he became a celebrity after being interviewed by Herbert Matthews, a journalist 
from the New York Times.[99] Reporters from CBS and Paris Match soon followed.[100] 
Castro's guerrillas increased their attacks on military outposts, forcing 
the government to withdraw from the Sierra Maestra region, and by spring 
1958, the rebels controlled a hospital, schools, a printing press, slaughterhouse, 
land-mine factory and a cigar-making factory.[101] By 1958, Batista was 
under increasing pressure, a result of his military failures coupled with 
increasing domestic and foreign criticism surrounding his administration's 
press censorship, torture, and extrajudicial executions.[102] Influenced 
by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased 
supplying him with weaponry.[102] The opposition called a general strike, 
accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7. Beginning on April 9, it 
received strong support in central and eastern Cuba, but little elsewhere.[103] 
Batista responded with an all-out-attack, Operation Verano, in which the 
army aerially bombarded forested areas and villages suspected of aiding 
the militants, while 10,000 soldiers commanded by General Eulogio Cantillo 
surrounded the Sierra Maestra, driving north to the rebel encampments.[104] 
Despite their numerical and technological superiority, the army had no 
experience with guerrilla warfare, and Castro halted their offensive using 
land mines and ambushes.[104] Many of Batista's soldiers defected to Castro's 
rebels, who also benefited from local popular support.[105] In the summer, 
the MR-26-7 went on the offensive, pushing the army out of the mountains, 
with Castro using his columns in a pincer movement to surround the main 
army concentration in Santiago. By November, Castro's forces controlled 
most of Oriente and Las Villas, and divided Cuba in two by closing major 
roads and rail lines, severely disadvantaging Batista.[106] Fearing Castro 
was a socialist, the U.S. instructed Cantillo to oust Batista.[107] Cantillo 
secretly agreed to a ceasefire with Castro, promising that Batista would 
be tried as a war criminal,[107] however Batista was warned, and fled into 
exile with over US$300,000,000 on December 31, 1958.[108] Cantillo entered 
Havana's Presidential Palace, proclaimed the Supreme Court judge Carlos 
Piedra to be President, and began appointing the new government.[109] Furious, 
Castro ended the ceasefire,[110] and ordered Cantillo's arrest by sympathetic 
figures in the army.[111] Accompanying celebrations at news of Batista's 
downfall on January 1, 1959, Castro ordered the MR-26-7 to prevent widespread 
looting and vandalism.[112] Cienfuegos and Guevara led their columns into 
Havana on January 2, while Castro entered Santiago and gave a speech invoking 
the wars of independence.[113] Heading toward Havana, he greeted cheering 
crowds at every town, giving press conferences and interviews.[114] At 
Castro's command, the politically moderate lawyer Manuel Urrutia Lleó was 
proclaimed provisional president, with Castro erroneously announcing he 
had been selected by "popular election"; most of Urrutia's cabinet were 
MR-26-7 members.[115] Entering Havana, Castro proclaimed himself Representative 
of the Rebel Armed Forces of the Presidency, setting up home and office 
in the penthouse of the Havana Hilton Hotel.[116] Castro exercised a great 
deal of influence over Urrutia's regime, which was now ruling by decree. 
He ensured that the government implemented policies to cut corruption and 
fight illiteracy and that it attempted to remove Batistanos from positions 
of power by dismissing Congress and barring all those elected in the rigged 
elections of 1954 and 1958 from future office. He then pushed Urrutia to 
issue a temporary ban on political parties; he repeatedly said that they 
would eventually hold multiparty elections.[117] Although repeatedly denying 
that he was a communist to the press, he began clandestinely meeting members 
of the Popular Socialist Party to discuss the creation of a socialist state.[118] 
We are not executing innocent people or political opponents. We are executing 
murderers and they deserve it. In suppressing the revolution, Batista's 
government had killed thousands of Cubans; at the time, Castro and influential 
sectors of the press put the death toll at 20,000,[120] although more recent 
estimates place it between 1000[121] and 4000.[122] In response to popular 
uproar, which demanded that those responsible be brought to justice, Castro 
helped set up many trials, resulting in hundreds of executions. Although 
widely popular domestically, critics–in particular the U.S. press–argued 
that many were not fair trials. Castro responded that "revolutionary justice 
is not based on legal precepts, but on moral conviction".[123] Acclaimed 
by many across Latin America, he traveled to Venezuela where he met with 
President-elect Rómulo Betancourt, unsuccessfully requesting a loan and 
a new deal for Venezuelan oil.[124] Returning home, an argument between 
Castro and senior government figures broke out. He was infuriated that 
the government had left thousands unemployed by closing down casinos and 
brothels. As a result, Prime Minister José Miró Cardona resigned, going 
into exile in the U.S. and joining the anti-Castro movement.[125] On February 
16, 1959, Castro was sworn in as Prime Minister of Cuba.[126] In April 
he visited the U.S. on a charm offensive where he met Vice President Richard 
Nixon, whom he instantly disliked.[127] Proceeding to Canada, Trinidad, 
Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, Castro attended an economic conference in 
Buenos Aires, unsuccessfully proposing a $30 billion U.S.-funded "Marshall 
Plan" for Latin America.[128] In May 1959 Castro signed into law the First 
Agrarian Reform, setting a cap for landholdings to 993 acres (402 ha) per 
owner and prohibiting foreigners from obtaining Cuban land ownership. Around 
200,000 peasants received title deeds as large land holdings were broken 
up; popular among the working class, it alienated the richer landowners.[129] 
Castro appointed himself president of the National Tourist Industry, introducing 
unsuccessful measures to encourage African-American tourists to visit, 
advertising Cuba as a tropical paradise free of racial discrimination.[130] 
Judges and politicians had their pay reduced while low-level civil servants 
saw theirs raised,[131] and in March 1959, Castro declared rents for those 
who paid less than $100 a month halved.[132] Although refusing to categorize 
his regime as socialist and repeatedly denying being a communist, Castro 
appointed Marxists to senior government and military positions. Most notably, 
Che Guevara became Governor of the Central Bank and then Minister of Industries. 
Appalled, Air Force commander Pedro Luis Díaz Lanz defected to the U.S.[133] 
Although President Urrutia denounced the defection, he expressed concern 
with the rising influence of Marxism. Angered, Castro in turn announced 
his resignation as Prime Minister, blaming Urrutia for complicating government 
with his "fevered anti-Communism". Over 500,000 Castro-supporters surrounded 
the Presidential Palace demanding Urrutia's resignation, which he submitted. 
On July 23, Castro resumed his Premiership and appointed Marxist Osvaldo 
Dorticós as President.[134] Castro's government emphasised social projects 
to improve Cuba's standard of living, often to the detriment of economic 
development.[135] Major emphasis was placed on education, and during the 
first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than 
in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a 
work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the 
other half in a productive activity.[136] Health care was nationalized 
and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up 
across the island to offer free medical aid. Universal vaccination against 
childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced 
dramatically.[135] A third part of this social program was the improvement 
of infrastructure. Within the first six months of Castro's government, 
600 miles of roads were built across the island, while $300 million was 
spent on water and sanitation projects.[135] Over 800 houses were constructed 
every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut 
homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children 
and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.[135] Castro used 
radio and television to develop a "dialogue with the people", posing questions 
and making provocative statements.[137] His regime remained popular with 
workers, peasants, and students, who constituted the majority of the country's 
population,[138] while opposition came primarily from the middle class; 
thousands of doctors, engineers and other professionals emigrated to Florida 
in the U.S., causing an economic brain drain.[139] Productivity decreased 
and the country's financial reserves were drained within two years.[132] 
After conservative press expressed hostility towards the government, the 
pro-Castro printers' trade union disrupted editorial staff, and in January 
1960 the government ordered them to publish a "clarification" written by 
the printers' union at the end of articles critical of the government.[140] 
Castro's government arrested hundreds of counter-revolutionaries,[141] 
many of whom were subjected to solitary confinement, rough treatment, and 
threatening behavior.[142] Militant anti-Castro groups, funded by exiles, 
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the Dominican government, undertook 
armed attacks and set up guerrilla bases in Cuba's mountains, leading to 
the six-year War against the Bandits.[143] By 1960, the Cold War raged 
between two superpowers: the United States, a capitalist liberal democracy, 
and the Soviet Union (USSR), a Marxist-Leninist socialist state ruled by 
the Communist Party. Expressing contempt for the U.S., Castro shared the 
ideological views of the USSR, establishing relations with several Marxist-Leninist 
states.[144] Meeting with Soviet First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan, 
Castro agreed to provide the USSR with sugar, fruit, fibers, and hides, 
in return for crude oil, fertilizers, industrial goods, and a $100 million 
loan.[145] Cuba's government ordered the country's refineries – then controlled 
by the U.S. corporations Shell, Esso and Standard Oil – to process Soviet 
oil, but under U.S. pressure, they refused. Castro responded by expropriating 
and nationalizing the refineries. Retaliating, the U.S. cancelled its import 
of Cuban sugar, provoking Castro to nationalize most U.S.-owned assets 
on the island, including banks and sugar mills.[146] Relations between 
Cuba and the U.S. were further strained following the explosion of a French 
vessel, the Le Coubre, in Havana harbor in March 1960. The ship carried 
weapons purchased from Belgium, the cause of the explosion was never determined, 
but Castro publicly insinuated that the U.S. government were guilty of 
sabotage. He ended this speech with "¡Patria o Muerte!" ("Fatherland or 
Death"), a proclamation that he made much use of in ensuing years.[147] 
Inspired by their earlier success with the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état, 
in March 1960, U.S. President Eisenhower authorized the CIA to overthrow 
Castro's government. He provided them with a budget of $13 million and 
permitted them to ally with the Mafia, who were aggrieved that Castro's 
government closed down their brothel and casino businesses in Cuba.[148] 
On October 13, 1960, the U.S. prohibited the majority of exports to Cuba, 
initiating an economic embargo. In retaliation, the National Institute 
for Agrarian Reform INRA took control of 383 private-run businesses on 
October 14, and on October 25 a further 166 U.S. companies operating in 
Cuba had their premises seized and nationalized.[149] On December 16, the 
U.S. ended its import quota of Cuban sugar, the country's primary export.[150] 
In September 1960, Castro flew to New York City for the General Assembly 
of the United Nations. Staying at the Hotel Theresa in Harlem, he met with 
journalists and anti-establishment figures like Malcolm X. He also met 
Soviet Premier Nikita Khruschev, with the two publicly condemning the poverty 
and racism faced by Americans in areas like Harlem. Relations between Castro 
and Khrushchev were warm; they led the applause to one another's speeches 
at the General Assembly.[151] Subsequently visited by Polish First Secretary 
Władysław Gomułka, Bulgarian Chairman Todor Zhivkov, Egyptian President 
Gamal Abdel Nasser and Indian Premier Jawaharlal Nehru,[152] Castro also 
received an evening's reception from the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.[153] 
Back in Cuba, Castro feared a U.S.-backed coup; in 1959 his regime spent 
$120 million on Soviet, French, and Belgian weaponry and by early 1960 
had doubled the size of Cuba's armed forces.[154] Fearing counter-revolutionary 
elements in the army, the government created a People's Militia to arm 
citizens favorable to the revolution, training at least 50,000 civilians 
in combat techniques.[155] In September 1960, they created the Committees 
for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), a nationwide civilian organization 
which implemented neighborhood spying to detect counter-revolutionary activities 
as well as organizing health and education campaigns, becoming a conduit 
for public complaints. By 1970, a third of the population would be involved 
in the CDR, and this would come to rise to 80%.[156] Castro proclaimed 
the new administration a direct democracy, in which Cubans could assemble 
at demonstrations to express their democratic will. As a result, he rejected 
the need for elections, claiming that representative democratic systems 
served the interests of socio-economic elites.[157] U.S. Secretary of State 
Christian Herter announced that Cuba was adopting the Soviet model of rule, 
with a one-party state, government control of trade unions, suppression 
of civil liberties, and the absence of freedom of speech and press.[158] 
There was... no doubts about who the victors were. Cuba's stature in the 
world soared to new heights, and Fidel's role as the adored and revered 
leader among ordinary Cuban people received a renewed boost. His popularity 
was greater than ever. In his own mind he had done what generations of 
Cubans had only fantasized about: he had taken on the United States and 
won. In January 1961, Castro ordered Havana's U.S. Embassy to reduce its 
300 staff, suspecting many to be spies. The U.S. responded by ending diplomatic 
relations, and increasing CIA funding for exiled dissidents; these militants 
began attacking ships trading with Cuba, and bombed factories, shops, and 
sugar mills.[160] Both Eisenhower and his successor John F. Kennedy supported 
a CIA plan to aid a dissident militia, the Democratic Revolutionary Front, 
to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro; the plan resulted in the Bay of Pigs 
Invasion in April 1961. On April 15, CIA-supplied B-26's bombed 3 Cuban 
military airfields; the U.S. announced that the perpetrators were defecting 
Cuban air force pilots, but Castro exposed these claims as false flag misinformation.[161] 
Fearing invasion, he ordered the arrest of between 20,000 and 100,000 suspected 
counter-revolutionaries,[162] publicly proclaiming that "What the imperialists 
cannot forgive us, is that we have made a Socialist revolution under their 
noses", his first announcement that the government was socialist.[163] 
The CIA and Democratic Revolutionary Front had based a 1,400-strong army, 
Brigade 2506, in Nicaragua. In the night from April 16 to 17, Brigade 2506 
landed along Cuba's Bay of Pigs, and engaged in a firefight with a local 
revolutionary militia. Castro ordered Captain José Ramón Fernández to launch 
the counter-offensive, before taking personal control himself. After bombing 
the invaders' ships and bringing in reinforcements, Castro forced the Brigade's 
surrender on April 20.[164] He ordered the 1189 captured rebels to be interrogated 
by a panel of journalists on live television, personally taking over questioning 
on April 25. 14 were put on trial for crimes allegedly committed before 
the revolution, while the others were returned to the U.S. in exchange 
for medicine and food valued at U.S. $25 million.[165] Castro's victory 
was a powerful symbol across Latin America, but it also increased internal 
opposition primarily among the middle-class Cubans who had been detained 
in the run-up to the invasion. Although most were freed within a few days, 
many fled to the U.S., establishing themselves in Florida.[166] Consolidating 
"Socialist Cuba", Castro united the MR-26-7, Popular Socialist Party and 
Revolutionary Directorate into a governing party based on the Leninist 
principle of democratic centralism: the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations 
(Organizaciones Revolucionarias Integradas - ORI), renamed the United Party 
of the Cuban Socialist Revolution (PURSC) in 1962.[167] Although the USSR 
was hesitant regarding Castro's embrace of socialism,[168] relations with 
the Soviets deepened. Castro sent Fidelito for a Moscow schooling,[169] 
Soviet technicians arrived on the island,[169] and Castro was awarded the 
Lenin Peace Prize.[170] In December 1961, Castro admitted that he had been 
a Marxist-Leninist for years, and in his Second Declaration of Havana he 
called on Latin America to rise up in revolution.[171] In response, the 
U.S. successfully pushed the Organization of American States to expel Cuba; 
the Soviets privately reprimanded Castro for recklessness, although he 
received praise from China.[172] Despite their ideological affinity with 
China, in the Sino-Soviet Split, Cuba allied with the wealthier Soviets, 
who offered economic and military aid.[173] The ORI began shaping Cuba 
using the Soviet model, persecuting political opponents and perceived social 
deviants such as prostitutes and homosexuals; Castro considered same-sex 
sexual activity a bourgeois trait.[174] Gay men were forced into the Military 
Units to Aid Production (Unidades Militares de Ayuda a la Producción - 
UMAP); after many revolutionary intellectuals decried this move, the UMAP 
camps were closed in 1967, although gay men continued to be imprisoned.[175] 
In 2010, Castro took responsibility for this persecution, regretting it 
as a "great injustice".[176] By 1962, Cuba's economy was in steep decline, 
a result of poor economic management and low productivity coupled with 
the U.S. trade embargo. Food shortages led to rationing, resulting in protests 
in Cárdenas.[177] Security reports indicated that many Cubans associated 
austerity with the "Old Communists" of the PSP, while Castro considered 
a number of them – namely Aníbal Escalante and Blas Roca – unduly loyal 
to Moscow. In March 1962 Castro removed the most prominent "Old Communists" 
from office, labelling them "sectarian".[178] On a personal level, Castro 
was increasingly lonely, and his relations with Guevara became strained 
as the latter became increasingly anti-Soviet and pro-Chinese.[179] Militarily 
weaker than NATO, Khrushchev wanted to install Soviet R-12 MRBM nuclear 
missiles on Cuba to even the power balance.[180] Although conflicted, Castro 
agreed, believing it would guarantee Cuba's safety and enhance the cause 
of socialism.[181] Undertaken in secrecy, only the Castro brothers, Guevara, 
Dorticós and security chief Ramiro Valdés knew the full plan.[182] Upon 
discovering it through aerial reconnaissance, in October the U.S. implemented 
an island-wide quarantine to search vessels headed to Cuba, sparking the 
Cuban Missile Crisis. The U.S. saw the missiles as offensive; Castro insisted 
they were for defense only.[183] Castro urged Khrushchev to threaten a 
nuclear strike on the U.S. should Cuba be attacked, but Khrushchev was 
desperate to avoid nuclear war.[184] Castro was left out of the negotiations, 
in which Khruschev agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for a U.S. 
commitment not to invade Cuba and an understanding that the U.S. would 
remove their MRBMs from Turkey and Italy.[185] Feeling betrayed by Khruschev, 
Castro was furious and soon fell ill.[186] Proposing a five-point plan, 
Castro demanded that the U.S. end its embargo, withdraw from Guantanamo 
Bay Naval Base, cease supporting dissidents, and stop violating Cuban air 
space and territorial waters. Presenting these demands to U Thant, visiting 
Secretary-General of the United Nations, the U.S. ignored them, and in 
turn Castro refused to allow the U.N.'s inspection team into Cuba.[187] 
In May 1963, Castro visited the USSR at Khrushchev's personal invitation, 
touring 14 cities, addressing a Red Square rally, and being awarded both 
the Order of Lenin and an honorary doctorate from Moscow State University.[188] 
While there Castro was permitted to sign a Soviet R-16 intercontinental 
ballistic missile.[189] Castro returned to Cuba with new ideas; inspired 
by Soviet newspaper Pravda, he amalgamated Hoy and Revolución into a new 
daily, Granma,[190] and oversaw large investment into Cuban sport that 
resulted in an increased international sporting reputation.[191] Seeking 
to further consolidate control, in 1963 the government cracked down on 
Protestant sects in Cuba, with Castro labeling them counter-revolutionary 
"instruments of imperialism"; many preachers were found guilty of illegal 
U.S.-links and imprisoned.[192] Measures were implemented to force perceived 
idle and delinquent youths to work, primarily through the introduction 
of mandatory military service,[193] while in September the government temporarily 
permitted emigration for anyone other than males aged between 15 and 26, 
thereby ridding the government of thousands of critics, most of whom were 
from upper and middle-class backgrounds.[194] In 1963 Castro's mother died. 
This was the last time his private life was reported in Cuba's press.[195] 
In January 1964, Castro returned to Moscow, officially to sign a new five-year 
sugar trade agreement, but also to discuss the ramifications of the assassination 
of John F. Kennedy;[196] Castro had been deeply concerned by the assassination, 
believing that a far right conspiracy was behind it but that the Cubans 
would be blamed.[197] In October 1965, the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations 
was officially renamed the "Cuban Communist Party" and published the membership 
of its Central Committee.[198] The greatest threat presented by Castro's 
Cuba is as an example to other Latin American states which are beset by 
poverty, corruption, feudalism, and plutocratic exploitation ... his influence 
in Latin America might be overwhelming and irresistible if, with Soviet 
help, he could establish in Cuba a Communist utopia. Despite Soviet misgivings, 
Castro continued calling for global revolution, funding militant leftists 
and those engaged in national liberation struggles. Cuba's foreign policy 
was staunchly anti-imperialist, believing that every nation should control 
its own natural resources.[200] He supported Che Guevara's "Andean project", 
an unsuccessful plan to set up a guerrilla movement in the highlands of 
Bolivia, Peru and Argentina, and allowed revolutionary groups from across 
the world, from the Viet Cong to the Black Panthers, to train in Cuba.[201] 
He considered Western-dominated Africa ripe for revolution, and sent troops 
and medics to aid Ahmed Ben Bella's socialist regime in Algeria during 
the Sand war. He also allied with Alphonse Massemba-Débat's socialist government 
in Congo-Brazzaville, and in 1965 Castro authorized Guevara to travel to 
Congo-Kinshasa to train revolutionaries against the Western-backed government.[202] 
Castro was personally devastated when Guevara was subsequently killed by 
CIA-backed troops in Bolivia in October 1967 and publicly attributed it 
to Che's disregard for his own safety.[203] In 1966 Castro staged a Tri-Continental 
Conference of Africa, Asia and Latin America in Havana, further establishing 
himself as a significant player on the world stage.[204] From this conference, 
Castro created the Latin American Solidarity Organization (OLAS), which 
adopted the slogan of "The duty of a revolution is to make revolution", 
signifying Havana's leadership of Latin America's revolutionary movement.[205] 
Castro's increasing role on the world stage strained his relationship with 
the USSR, now under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev. Asserting Cuba's 
independence, Castro refused to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons, declaring it a Soviet-U.S. attempt to dominate the 
Third World.[206] Diverting from Soviet Marxist doctrine, he suggested 
that Cuban society could evolve straight to pure communism rather than 
progressing through various stages of socialism.[207] In turn, Soviet-loyalist 
Aníbal Escalante began organizing a government network of opposition to 
Castro, though in January 1968, he and his supporters were arrested for 
allegedly passing state secrets to Moscow.[208] However, recognising Cuba's 
economic dependence on the Soviets, Castro relented to Brezhnev's pressure 
to be obedient, and in August 1968 denounced the leaders of the Prague 
Spring and praised the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.[209][210] 
Influenced by China's Great Leap Forward, in 1968 Castro proclaimed a Great 
Revolutionary Offensive, closing all remaining privately owned shops and 
businesses and denouncing their owners as capitalist counter-revolutionaries.[211] 
The severe lack of consumer goods for purchase led productivity to decline, 
as large sectors of the population felt little incentive to work hard.[212] 
This was exacerbated by the perception that a revolutionary elite had emerged 
consisting of those connected to the administration; they had access to 
better housing, private transportation, servants, and the ability to purchase 
luxury goods abroad.[213] Castro publicly celebrated his administration's 
10th anniversary in January 1969; in his celebratory speech he warned of 
sugar rations, reflecting the nation's economic problems.[214] The 1969 
crop was heavily damaged by a hurricane, and to meet its export quota, 
the government drafted in the army, implemented a seven-day working week, 
and postponed public holidays to lengthen the harvest.[215] When that year's 
production quota was not met, Castro offered to resign during a public 
speech, but assembled crowds insisted he remain.[216] Despite the economic 
issues, many of Castro's social reforms were popular, with the population 
largely supportive of the "Achievements of the Revolution" in education, 
medical care, housing, and road construction, as well as the policies of 
"direct democratic" public consultation.[217] Seeking Soviet help, from 
1970 to 1972 Soviet economists re-organized Cuba's economy, founding the 
Cuban-Soviet Commission of Economic, Scientific and Technical Collaboration, 
while Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin visited in 1971.[218] In July 1972, 
Cuba joined the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon), an economic 
organization of socialist states, although this further limited Cuba's 
economy to agricultural production.[219] In May 1970, the crews of two 
Cuban fishing boats were kidnapped by Florida-based dissident group Alpha 
66, who demanded that Cuba release imprisoned militants. Under U.S. pressure, 
the hostages were released, and Castro welcomed them back as heroes.[220] 
In April 1971, Castro was internationally condemned for ordering the arrest 
of dissident poet Heberto Padilla; Padilla was freed, but the government 
established the National Cultural Council to ensure that intellectuals 
and artists supported the administration.[221] In 1971, Castro visited 
Chile, where Marxist President Salvador Allende had been elected as the 
head of a left-wing coalition. Castro supported Allende's socialist reforms, 
but warned him of right-wing elements in Chile's military. In 1973, the 
military led a coup d'état and established a military junta led by Augusto 
Pinochet.[222] Castro proceeded to Guinea to meet socialist President Sékou 
Touré, praising him as Africa's greatest leader, and there received the 
Order of Fidelity to the People.[223] He then went on a seven-week tour 
visiting leftist allies: Algeria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, East Germany, 
Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, where he was given further awards. 
On each trip, he was eager to visit factory and farm workers, publicly 
praising their governments; privately, he urged the regimes to aid revolutionary 
movements elsewhere, particularly those fighting the Vietnam War.[224] 
In September 1973, he returned to Algiers to attend the Fourth Summit of 
the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Various NAM members were critical of Castro's 
attendance, claiming that Cuba was aligned to the Warsaw Pact and therefore 
should not be at the conference.[225] At the conference he publicly broke 
off relations with Israel, citing its government's close relationship with 
the U.S. and its treatment of Palestinians during the Israel-Palestine 
conflict. This earned Castro respect throughout the Arab world, in particular 
from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who became his friend and ally.[226] 
As the Yom Kippur War broke out in October 1973 between Israel and an Arab 
coalition led by Egypt and Syria, Cuba sent 4,000 troops to defend Syrian 
territory from Israeli incursions.[227] Leaving Algiers, Castro visited 
Iraq and North Vietnam.[228] Cuba's economy grew in 1974 as a result of 
high international sugar prices and new credits with Argentina, Canada, 
and parts of Western Europe.[229] A number of Latin American states called 
for Cuba's re-admittance into the Organization of American States (OAS), 
with the U.S. finally conceding in 1975 on Henry Kissinger's advice.[230] 
Cuba's government underwent a restructuring along Soviet lines, claiming 
that this would further democratization and decentralize power away from 
Castro. Officially announcing Cuba's identity as a socialist state, the 
first National Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held, and a new 
constitution adopted that abolished the position of President and Prime 
Minister. Castro remained the dominant figure in governance, taking the 
presidency of the newly created Council of State and Council of Ministers, 
making him both head of state and head of government.[231] Castro considered 
Africa to be "the weakest link in the imperialist chain", and at the request 
of Angolan President Agostinho Neto he ordered 230 military advisers into 
Southern Africa in November 1975 to aid Neto's Marxist MPLA in the Angolan 
Civil War. When the U.S. and South Africa stepped up their support of the 
opposition FLNA and UNITA, Castro ordered a further 18,000 troops to Angola, 
which played a major role in forcing a South African retreat.[232] Traveling 
to Angola, Castro celebrated with Neto, Sékou Touré and Guinea-Bissaun 
President Luís Cabral, where they agreed to support Mozambique's Marxist-Leninist 
government against RENAMO in the Mozambique Civil War.[233] In February, 
Castro visited Algeria and then Libya, where he spent ten days with Gaddafi 
and oversaw the establishment of the Jamahariya system of governance, before 
attending talks with the Marxist government of South Yemen. From there 
he proceeded to Somalia, Tanzania, Mozambique and Angola where he was greeted 
by crowds as a hero for Cuba's role in opposing apartheid South Africa.[234] 
Throughout much of Africa he was hailed as a friend to national liberation 
from foreign dominance.[235] This was followed with visits to Berlin and 
Moscow.[236] There is often talk of human rights, but it is also necessary 
to talk of the rights of humanity. Why should some people walk barefoot, 
so that others can travel in luxurious cars? Why should some live for thirty-five 
years, so that others can live for seventy years? Why should some be miserably 
poor, so that others can be hugely rich? I speak on behalf of the children 
in the world who do not have a piece of bread. I speak on the behalf of 
the sick who have no medicine, of those whose rights to life and human 
dignity have been denied. In 1977 the Ethio-Somali War broke out over the 
disputed Ogaden region as Somalia invaded Ethiopia; although a former ally 
of Somali President Siad Barre, Castro had warned him against such action, 
and Cuba sided with Mengistu Haile Mariam's Marxist government of Ethiopia. 
He sent troops under the command of General Arnaldo Ochoa to aid the overwhelmed 
Ethiopian army. After forcing back the Somalis, Mengistu then ordered the 
Ethiopians to suppress the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, a measure 
Castro refused to support.[238] Castro extended support to Latin American 
revolutionary movements, namely the Sandinista National Liberation Front 
in its overthrow of the Nicaraguan rightist government of Anastasio Somoza 
Debayle in July 1979.[239] Castro's critics accused the government of wasting 
Cuban lives in these military endeavors; the anti-Castro Center for a Free 
Cuba has claimed that an estimated 14,000 Cubans were killed in foreign 
Cuban military actions.[240] When U.S. state critics claimed that Castro 
had no right to interfere in these nations, he highlighted that Cuba had 
been invited into them, pointing out the U.S.' own involvement in various 
foreign nations.[241] In 1979, the Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement 
(NAM) was held in Havana, where Castro was selected as NAM president, a 
position he held till 1982. In his capacity as both President of the NAM 
and of Cuba he appeared at the United Nations General Assembly in October 
1979 and gave a speech on the disparity between the world's rich and poor. 
His speech was greeted with much applause from other world leaders,[242] 
though his standing in NAM was damaged by Cuba's abstinence from the U.N.'s 
General Assembly condemnation of the Soviet war in Afghanistan.[243] Cuba's 
relations across North America improved under Mexican President Luis Echeverría, 
Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau,[244] and U.S. President Jimmy Carter. 
Carter continued criticizing Cuba's human rights abuses, but adopted a 
respectful approach which gained Castro's attention. Considering Carter 
well-meaning and sincere, Castro freed certain political prisoners and 
allowed some Cuban exiles to visit relatives on the island, hoping that 
in turn Carter would abolish the economic embargo and stop CIA support 
for militant dissidents.[245] Conversely, his relationship with China declined, 
as he accused Deng Xiaoping's Chinese government of betraying their revolutionary 
principles by initiating trade links with the U.S. and attacking Vietnam.[246] 
By the 1980s, Cuba's economy was again in trouble, following a decline 
in the market price of sugar and 1979's decimated harvest.[247] For the 
first time, unemployment became a serious problem in Castro's Cuba, with 
the government sending unemployed youth to other countries, primarily East 
Germany, to work there.[248] Desperate for money, Cuba's government secretly 
sold off paintings from national collections and illicitly traded for U.S. 
electronic goods through Panama.[249] Increasing numbers of Cubans fled 
to Florida, but were labelled "scum" and "lumpen" by Castro and his CDR 
supporters.[250] In one incident, 10,000 Cubans stormed the Peruvian Embassy 
requesting asylum, and so the U.S. agreed that it would accept 3,500 refugees. 
Castro conceded that those who wanted to leave could do so from Mariel 
port. Hundreds of boats arrived from the U.S., leading to a mass exodus 
of 120,000; Castro's government took advantage of the situation by loading 
criminals, the mentally ill, and suspected homosexuals onto the boats destined 
for Florida.[251] The event destabilized Carter's administration and in 
1981 the right-wing Ronald Reagan was elected U.S. President. Reagan's 
administration adopted a hard-line approach against Castro, making its 
desire to overthrow his regime clear.[252] In late 1981, Castro publicly 
accused the U.S. of biological warfare against Cuba by orchestrating a 
dengue fever epidemic.[253] Although despising Argentina's right wing military 
junta, Castro supported them in the 1982 Falklands War against Britain 
and offered military aid to the Argentinians.[254] Castro supported the 
leftist New Jewel Movement that seized power in Grenada in 1979, befriending 
Grenadine President Maurice Bishop and sending doctors, teachers, and technicians 
to aid the country's development. When Bishop was executed in a Soviet-backed 
coup by hard-line Marxist Bernard Coard in October 1983, Castro condemned 
the killing but cautiously retained support for Grenada's government. However, 
the U.S. used the coup as a basis for invading the island. Cuban soldiers 
died in the conflict, with Castro denouncing the invasion and comparing 
the U.S. to Nazi Germany.[255] In a July 1983 speech marking the 30th anniversary 
of the Cuban Revolution, Castro condemned Reagan's administration as a 
"reactionary, extremist clique" who were waging an "openly warmongering 
and fascist foreign policy".[256] Castro feared a U.S. invasion of Nicaragua 
and sent Ochoa to train the governing Sandinistas in guerrilla warfare, 
but received little support from the USSR.[257] In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev 
became Secretary-General of the Soviet Communist Party. A reformer, he 
implemented measures to increase freedom of the press (glasnost) and economic 
decentralization (perestroika) in an attempt to strengthen socialism. Like 
many orthodox Marxist critics, Castro feared that the reforms would weaken 
the socialist state and allow capitalist elements to regain control.[258] 
Gorbachev conceded to U.S. demands to reduce support for Cuba,[259] with 
Soviet-Cuban relations deteriorating.[260] When Gorbachev visited Cuba 
in April 1989, he informed Castro that perestroika meant an end to subsidies 
for Cuba.[261] Ignoring calls for liberalization in accordance with the 
Soviet example, Castro continued to clamp down on internal dissidents and 
in particular kept tabs on the military, the primary threat to the government. 
A number of senior military officers, including Ochoa and Tony de la Guardia, 
were investigated for corruption and complicity in cocaine smuggling, tried, 
and executed in 1989, despite calls for leniency.[262] On medical advice 
given him in October 1985, Castro gave up regularly smoking Cuban cigars, 
helping to set an example for the rest of the populace.[263] Castro became 
passionate in his denunciation of the Third World debt problem, arguing 
that the Third World would never escape the debt that First World banks 
and governments imposed upon it. In 1985, Havana hosted five international 
conferences on the world debt problem.[249] By November 1987, Castro began 
spending more time on the Angolan Civil War, in which the Marxists had 
fallen into retreat. Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos successfully 
appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted 
more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory 
would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated 
end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between 
the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops 
would pull out of Angola. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing 
that he was abandoning the plight of the world's poor in favor of détente.[264] 
In Eastern Europe, socialist governments fell to capitalist reformers between 
1989 and 1991 and many Western observers expected the same in Cuba.[265] 
Increasingly isolated, Cuba improved relations with Manuel Noriega's right-wing 
government in Panama – despite Castro's personal hatred of Noriega – but 
it was overthrown in a U.S. invasion in December 1989.[266] In February 
1990, Castro's allies in Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas, 
were defeated by the U.S.-funded National Opposition Union in an election.[267] 
With the collapse of the Soviet bloc, the U.S. secured a majority vote 
for a resolution condemning Cuba's human rights violations at the United 
Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland. Cuba asserted that 
this was a manifestation of U.S. hegemony, and refused to allow an investigative 
delegation to enter the country.[268] With favourable trade from the Soviet 
bloc ended, Castro publicly declared that Cuba was entering a "Special 
Period in Time of Peace." Petrol rations were dramatically reduced, Chinese 
bicycles were imported to replace cars, and factories performing non-essential 
tasks were shut down. Oxen began to replace tractors, firewood began being 
used for cooking and electricity cuts were introduced that lasted 16 hours 
a day. Castro admitted that Cuba faced the worst situation short of open 
war, and that the country might have to resort to subsistence farming.[269] 
By 1992, Cuba's economy had declined by over 40% in under two years, with 
major food shortages, widespread malnutrition and a lack of basic goods.[270] 
Castro hoped for a restoration of Marxism-Leninism in the USSR, but refrained 
from backing the 1991 coup in that country.[271] When Gorbachev regained 
control, Cuba-Soviet relations deteriorated further and Soviet troops were 
withdrawn in September 1991.[272] In December, the Soviet Union was officially 
dismantled as Boris Yeltsin abolished the Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union and introducing a capitalist multiparty democracy. Yeltsin despised 
Castro and developed links with the Miami-based Cuban American National 
Foundation.[273] Castro tried improving relations with the capitalist nations. 
He welcomed Western politicians and investors to Cuba, befriended Manuel 
Fraga and took a particular interest in Margaret Thatcher's policies in 
the UK, believing that Cuban socialism could learn from her emphasis on 
low taxation and personal initiative.[274] He ceased support for foreign 
militants, refrained from praising FARC on a 1994 visit to Colombia and 
called for a negotiated settlement between the Zapatistas and Mexican government 
in 1995. Publicly, he presented himself as a moderate on the world stage.[275] 
In 1991, Havana hosted the Pan-American Games, which involved construction 
of a stadium and accommodation for the athletes; Castro admitted that it 
was an expensive error, but it was a success for Cuba's government. Crowds 
regularly shouted "Fidel! Fidel!" in front of foreign journalists, while 
Cuba became the first Latin American nation to beat the U.S. to the top 
of the gold-medal table.[276] Support for Castro remained strong, and although 
there were small anti-government demonstrations, the Cuban opposition rejected 
the exile community's calls for an armed uprising.[277] In August 1994, 
Havana witnessed the largest anti-Castro demonstration in Cuban history, 
as 200 to 300 young men threw stones at police, demanding that they be 
allowed to emigrate to Miami. A larger pro-Castro crowd confronted them, 
who were joined by Castro; he informed media that the men were anti-socials 
misled by the U.S. The protests dispersed with no recorded injuries.[278] 
Fearing that dissident groups would invade, the government organised the 
"War of All the People" defense strategy, planning a widespread guerrilla 
warfare campaign, and the unemployed were given jobs building a network 
of bunkers and tunnels across the country.[279] We do not have a smidgen 
of capitalism or neo-liberalism. We are facing a world completely ruled 
by neo-liberalism and capitalism. This does not mean that we are going 
to surrender. It means that we have to adopt to the reality of that world. 
That is what we are doing, with great equanimity, without giving up our 
ideals, our goals. I ask you to have trust in what the government and party 
are doing. They are defending, to the last atom, socialist ideas, principles 
and goals. Castro believed in the need for reform if Cuban socialism was 
to survive in a world now dominated by capitalist free markets. In October 
1991, the Fourth Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held in Santiago, 
at which a number of important changes to the government were announced. 
Castro would step down as head of government, to be replaced by the much 
younger Carlos Lage, although Castro would remain the head of the Communist 
Party and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Many older members of 
government were to be retired and replaced by their younger counterparts. 
A number of economic changes were proposed, and subsequently put to a national 
referendum. Free farmers' markets and small-scale private enterprises would 
be legalized in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, while U.S. dollars 
were also made legal tender. Certain restrictions on emigration were eased, 
allowing more discontented Cuban citizens to move to the United States. 
Further democratization was to be brought in by having the National Assembly's 
members elected directly by the people, rather than through municipal and 
provincial assemblies. Castro welcomed debate between proponents and opponents 
of the reforms, although over time he began to increasingly sympathise 
with the opponent's positions, arguing that such reforms must be delayed.[281] 
Castro's government diversified its economy into biotechnology and tourism, 
the latter outstripping Cuba's sugar industry as its primary source of 
revenue in 1995.[282] The arrival of thousands of Mexican and Spanish tourists 
led to increasing numbers of Cubans turning to prostitution; officially 
illegal, Castro refrained from cracking down on prostitution, fearing a 
political backlash.[283] Economic hardship led many Cubans toward religion, 
both in the form of Roman Catholicism and Santeria. Although long thinking 
religious belief to be backward, Castro softened his approach to religious 
institutions and religious people were permitted for the first time to 
join the Communist Party.[284] Although he viewed the Roman Catholic Church 
as a reactionary, pro-capitalist institution, Castro organized a visit 
to Cuba by Pope John Paul II for January 1998; it strengthened the position 
of both the Cuban Church and Castro's government.[285] In the early 1990s 
Castro embraced environmentalism, campaigning against global warming and 
the waste of natural resources, and accusing the U.S. of being the world's 
primary polluter.[286] In 1994 a ministry dedicated to the environment 
was established, and new laws established in 1997 that promoted awareness 
of environmental issues throughout Cuba and stressed the sustainable use 
of natural resources.[287] By 2006, Cuba was the world's only nation which 
met the United Nations Development Programme's definition of sustainable 
development, with an ecological footprint of less than 1.8 hectares per 
capita and a Human Development Index of over 0.8.[288] Castro also became 
a proponent of the anti-globalization movement, criticizing U.S. global 
hegemony and the control exerted by multinationals.[286] Castro maintained 
his devout anti-apartheid beliefs, and at the July 26 celebrations in 1991, 
he was joined onstage by the South African political activist Nelson Mandela, 
recently released from prison. Mandela praised Cuba's involvement in battling 
South Africa in Angola and thanked Castro personally.[289] He later attended 
Mandela's inauguration as President of South Africa in 1994.[290] In 2001 
he attended the Conference Against Racism in South Africa at which he lectured 
on the global spread of racial stereotypes through U.S. film.[286] Mired 
in economic problems, Cuba would be aided by the election of socialist 
and anti-imperialist Hugo Chávez to the Venezuelan Presidency in 1999.[291] 
Castro and Chávez developed a close friendship, with the former acting 
as a mentor and father-figure to the latter,[292] and together they built 
an alliance that had repercussions throughout Latin America.[293] In 2000, 
they signed an agreement through which Cuba would send 20,000 medics to 
Venezuela, in return receiving 53,000 barrels of oil per day at preferential 
rates; in 2004, this trade was stepped up, with Cuba sending 40,000 medics 
and Venezuela providing 90,000 barrels a day.[294][295] That same year, 
Castro initiated Misión Milagro, a joint medical project which aimed to 
provide free eye operations on 300,000 individuals from each nation.[296] 
The alliance boosted the Cuban economy,[297] and in May 2005 Castro doubled 
the minimum wage for 1.6 million workers, raised pensions, and delivered 
new kitchen appliances to Cuba's poorest residents.[291] Some economic 
problems remained; in 2004, Castro shut down 118 factories, including steel 
plants, sugar mills and paper processors to compensate for the crisis of 
fuel shortages.[298] Cuba and Venezuela were the founding members of the 
Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA).[293] ALBA sought to redistribute 
wealth evenly throughout member countries, to protect the region's agriculture, 
and to oppose economic liberalization and privatization.[299] ALBA's origins 
lay in a December 2004 agreement signed between the two countries, and 
was formalized through a People's Trade Agreement also signed by Evo Morales' 
Bolivia in April 2006.[300] Castro had also been calling for greater Caribbean 
integration since the late 1990s, saying that only strengthened cooperation 
between Caribbean countries would prevent their domination by rich nations 
in a global economy.[301][302] Cuba has opened four additional embassies 
in the Caribbean Community including: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Suriname, 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. This development makes Cuba the only 
country to have embassies in all independent countries of the Caribbean 
Community.[303] In contrast to the improved relations between Cuba and 
a number of leftist Latin American states, in 2004 it broke off diplomatic 
ties with Panama after centrist President Mireya Moscoso pardoned four 
Cuban exiles accused of attempting to assassinate Castro in 2000. Diplomatic 
ties were reinstalled in 2005 following the election of leftist President 
Martín Torrijos.[304] Castro's improving relations across Latin America 
were accompanied by continuing animosity towards the U.S. However, after 
massive damage caused by Hurricane Michelle in 2001, Castro successfully 
proposed a one-time cash purchase of food from the U.S. while declining 
its government's offer of humanitarian aid.[305] Castro expressed solidarity 
with the U.S. following the 2001 September 11 attacks, condemning Al Qaeda 
and offering Cuban airports for the emergency diversion of any U.S. planes.[306] 
He recognized that the attacks would make U.S. foreign policy more aggressive, 
which he believed was counter-productive.[307] In 1998, Canadian Prime 
Minister Jean Chrétien arrived in Cuba to meet Castro and highlight their 
close ties. He is the first Canadian government leader to visit the island 
since Pierre Trudeau was in Havana in 1976.[308] In 2002, former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter visited Cuba, where he highlighted the lack of civil liberties 
in the country and urged the government to pay attention to the Varela 
Project of Oswaldo Payá.[309] Castro underwent surgery for intestinal bleeding, 
and on July 31, 2006 delegated his presidential duties to Raúl Castro.[310] 
In February 2007, Raúl announced that Fidel's health was improving and 
that he was taking part in important issues of government.[311] Later that 
month, Fidel called into Hugo Chávez's radio show Aló Presidente.[312] 
On April 21, Castro met Wu Guanzheng of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo,[313] 
with Chávez visiting in August,[314] and Morales in September.[315] That 
month, the Non-Aligned Movement held its 14th Summit in Havana, there agreeing 
to appoint Castro as the organisation's president for a year's term.[316] 
Commenting on Castro's recovery, U.S. President George W. Bush said: "One 
day the good Lord will take Fidel Castro away". Hearing about this, the 
atheist Castro ironically replied: "Now I understand why I survived Bush's 
plans and the plans of other presidents who ordered my assassination: the 
good Lord protected me." The quote would subsequently be picked up on by 
the world's media.[317] In a February 2008 letter, Castro announced that 
he would not accept the positions of President of the Council of State 
and Commander in Chief at that month's National Assembly meetings,[318] 
remarking that "It would betray my conscience to take up a responsibility 
that requires mobility and total devotion, that I am not in a physical 
condition to offer".[319] On February 24, 2008, the National Assembly of 
People's Power unanimously voted Raúl as president.[320] Describing his 
brother as "not substitutable", Raúl proposed that Fidel continue to be 
consulted on matters of great importance, a motion unanimously approved 
by the 597 National Assembly members.[321] Following his retirement, Castro's 
health deteriorated; international press speculated that he had diverticulitis, 
but Cuba's government refused to corroborate this.[322] He continued to 
interact with the Cuban people, published an opinion column titled "Reflections" 
in Granma, used a Twitter account, and gave occasional public lectures.[322] 
In January 2009 Castro asked Cubans not to worry about his lack of recent 
news columns and failing health, and not to be disturbed by his future 
death.[323] He continued meeting foreign leaders and dignitaries, and that 
month photographs were released of Castro's meeting with Argentine President 
Cristina Fernández.[324] In July 2010, he made his first public appearance 
since falling ill, greeting science center workers and giving a television 
interview to Mesa Redonda in which he discussed U.S. tensions with Iran 
and North Korea.[325] On August 7, 2010, Castro gave his first speech to 
the National Assembly in four years, urging the U.S. not to take military 
actions against those nations and warning of a nuclear holocaust.[326] 
When asked whether Castro may be re-entering government, culture minister 
Abel Prieto told the BBC, "I think that he has always been in Cuba's political 
life but he is not in the government... He has been very careful about 
that. His big battle is international affairs."[327] On April 19, 2011, 
Castro resigned from the Communist Party central committee,[328] thus stepping 
down as party leader. Raúl was selected as his successor.[329] Now without 
any official role in the country's government, he took on the role of an 
elder statesman. In March 2012, Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba for three 
days, during which time he briefly met with Castro despite the Pope's vocal 
opposition to Cuba's government.[322][330] Later that year it was revealed 
that along with Hugo Chávez, Castro had played a significant behind-the-scenes 
role in orchestrating peace talks between the Colombian government and 
the far left FARC guerrilla movement to end the conflict which had raged 
since 1964.[331] During the North Korea crisis of 2013, he urged both the 
North Korean and U.S. governments to show restraint. Calling the situation 
"incredible and absurd," he maintained that war would not benefit either 
side, and that it represented "one of the gravest risks of nuclear war" 
since the Cuban missile crisis.[332] In December 2014, Castro was awarded 
the Chinese Confucius Peace Prize for seeking peaceful solutions to his 
nation's conflict with the U.S. and for his post-retirement efforts to 
prevent nuclear war.[333] In January 2015, he publicly commented on the 
"Cuban Thaw", an increased normalization between Cuba-U.S. relations, by 
stating that while it was a positive move for establishing peace in the 
region, he mistrusted the U.S. government.[334] He did not meet with U.S. 
President Barack Obama on the latter's visit to Cuba in March, although 
sent him a letter stating that Cuba "has no need of gifts from the empire".[335] 
In April 2016, he gave his most extensive public appearance in many years 
when addressing the Communist Party. Highlighting that he was soon to turn 
ninety years old, he noted that he would die in the near future but urged 
those assembled to retain their communist ideals.[336] In September 2016, 
Castro was visited at his Havana home by the Iranian President Hassan Rohani,[337] 
and later that month was visited by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.[338] 
Castro proclaimed himself to be "a Socialist, a Marxist, and a Leninist",[339] 
and has publicly identified as a Marxist-Leninist since December 1961.[340] 
As a Marxist, Castro sought to move Cuba from a capitalist state in which 
it was dominated by foreign imperialism to a socialist society and ultimately 
a communist society. Influenced by Guevara, he suggested that Cuba could 
evade most stages of socialism and progress straight to communism.[207] 
Castro's government was also nationalistic, with Castro declaring that 
"We are not only Marxist-Leninists, but also nationalists and patriots".[341] 
Historian Richard Gott remarked that one of the keys to Castro's success 
was in his ability to utilize the "twin themes of socialism and nationalism" 
and keep them "endlessly in play."[342] Castro describes Karl Marx and 
Cuban nationalist José Martí as his main political influences,[343] although 
Gott believed that ultimately Martí remained more important than Marx in 
Castro's politics.[342] Castro described Martí's political ideas as "a 
philosophy of independence and an exceptional humanistic philosophy",[344] 
and his supporters and apologists have repeatedly claimed great similarity 
between the two figures.[345] Biographer Volka Skierka described Castro's 
government as a "highly individual, socialist-nationalist "fidelista" system",[346] 
with Theodore Draper terming his approach "Castroism", viewing it as a 
blend of European socialism with the Latin American revolutionary tradition.[347] 
Political scientist Paul C. Sondrol has described Castro's approach to 
politics as "totalitarian utopianism",[348] with a style of leadership 
that drew upon the wider Latin American phenomenon of the caudillo.[349] 
Castro took a relatively socially conservative stance on many issues, opposing 
drug use, gambling, and prostitution, which he viewed as moral evils. Instead 
he advocated hard work, family values, integrity, and self-discipline.[350] 
Castro first and foremost is and always has been a committed egalitarian. 
He despises any system in which one class or group of people lives much 
better than another. He wanted a system that provided the basic needs to 
all—enough to eat, health care, adequate housing and education. The authoritarian 
nature of the Cuban Revolution stems largely from his commitment to that 
goal. Castro was convinced that he was right, and that his system was for 
the good of the people. Thus, anyone who stood against the revolution stood 
also against the Cuban people and that, in Castro's eyes, was simply unacceptable. 
There is, then, very little in the way of individual freedoms – especially 
freedom of expression and assembly. And there are political prisoners — 
those who have expressed positions against the revolution — though today 
only some 300, down markedly from the number at the outset of the revolution. 
Biographer Leycester Coltman described Castro as "fiercely hard-working, 
dedicated[,] loyal... generous and magnanimous" but noted that he could 
be "vindictive and unforgiving". He asserted that Castro "always had a 
keen sense of humor and could laugh at himself" but could equally be "a 
bad loser" who would act with "ferocious rage if he thought that he was 
being humiliated."[352] Castro was well known for throwing tantrums, and 
could make "snap judgements" which he refused to back down from.[353] Biographer 
Peter Bourne noted that Castro "suffers fools poorly" and that in his younger 
years he was intolerant of those who did not share his views.[354] He claimed 
that Castro liked to meet with ordinary citizens, both in Cuba and abroad, 
but took a particularly paternal attitude toward Cubans, treating them 
as if "they were a part of his own giant family."[355] British historian 
Alex Von Tunzelmann commented that "though ruthless, [Castro] was a patriot, 
a man with a profound sense that it was his mission to save the Cuban people".[356] 
Castro was known for his busy working hours, often only going to bed at 
3 or 4 a.m.[357] He preferred to meet foreign diplomats in these early 
hours, believing that they would be tired and he could gain the upper hand 
in negotiations.[358] He described Ernest Hemingway as his favorite writer,[359] 
and enjoyed reading but was uninterested in music.[263] A sports fan, he 
also spent much of his time trying to keep fit, undertaking regular exercise.[263] 
He took a great interest in gastronomy, as well as wine and whisky, and 
as Cuban leader was known to wander into his kitchen to discuss cookery 
with his chefs.[263] Castro had a lifelong love of guns,[360] and a preference 
for life in the countryside over the city.[361] While various sources state 
that Castro has not enriched himself, instead living a life more modest 
than most Latin American presidents,[348] his former bodyguard Juan Reinaldo 
Sánchez alleged that Castro lived in great luxury, with several houses 
and yachts which he has hidden from the Cuban populace.[362] Fidel Castro's 
religious beliefs have been a matter of some debate; he was baptized and 
raised a Roman Catholic but has commented that he is an atheist. He criticized 
use of the Bible to justify the oppression of women and Africans,[363] 
but commented that Christianity exhibited "a group of very humane precepts" 
which gave the world "ethical values" and a "sense of social justice", 
relating that "If people call me Christian, not from the standpoint of 
religion but from the standpoint of social vision, I declare that I am 
a Christian."[364] He has espoused the idea that Jesus Christ was a communist, 
citing the feeding of the 5000 and the story of Jesus and the rich young 
man as evidence.[365] Political scientist Paul C. Sondrol characterized 
Castro as "quintessentially totalitarian in his charismatic appeal, utopian 
functional role and public, transformative utilisation of power."[366] 
Unlike a number of other Soviet-era communist leaders, Castro's government 
did not intentionally construct a cult of personality around him, although 
his popularity among segments of the Cuban populace nevertheless led to 
one developing in the early years of his administration.[367] By 2006, 
the BBC reported that Castro's image could frequently be found in Cuban 
stores, classrooms, taxicabs, and on national television.[368] Throughout 
his administration, large throngs of supporters gathered to cheer at Castro's 
fiery speeches, which typically lasted for hours and which were delivered 
without the use of written notes.[369] During speeches Castro regularly 
cited reports and books he had read on a wide variety of subjects, including 
military matters, plant cultivation, filmmaking, and chess strategies.[370] 
For 37 years, Castro publicly wore nothing but olive-green military fatigues, 
emphasizing his role as the perpetual revolutionary, but in the mid-1990s 
began wearing dark civilian suits and guayabera publicly as well.[371] 
Within Cuba, Castro is often nicknamed "El Caballo" ("The Horse"), a label 
attributed to Cuban entertainer Benny Moré which alludes to Castro's well 
known womanizing during the 1950s and early 1960s,[372] and during this 
period Castro himself was widely recognized as a sex symbol in Cuba.[373] 
Many details of Castro's private life, particularly involving his family 
members, are scarce as such information is censored by state media.[374][375] 
Castro's biographer Robert E. Quirk noted that throughout his life, the 
Cuban leader had been "unable to form a lasting sexual relationship with 
any female."[376] Castro's first wife was Mirta Díaz-Balart, whom he married 
in October 1948, and together they have a son, Fidel Ángel "Fidelito" Castro 
Díaz-Balart, born in September 1949. Díaz-Balart and Castro divorced in 
1955, and she moved to Spain, although allegedly returned to Cuba in 2002 
to live with Fidelito.[377] Fidelito grew up in Cuba; for a time, he ran 
Cuba's atomic-energy commission before being removed from the post by his 
father.[378] Fidel has five other sons by his second wife, Dalia Soto del 
Valle: Antonio, Alejandro, Alexis, Alexander "Alex", and Ángel Castro Soto 
del Valle.[378] While Fidel was married to Mirta, he had an affair with 
Natalia "Naty" Revuelta Clews, who gave birth to his daughter, Alina Fernández 
Revuelta.[378] Alina left Cuba in 1993, disguised as a Spanish tourist,[379] 
and sought asylum in the U.S., from where she has criticized her father's 
policies.[380] By an unnamed woman he had another son, Jorge Ángel Castro. 
Fidel has another daughter, Francisca Pupo (born 1953) the result of a 
one night affair. Pupo and her husband now live in Miami.[381] Castro often 
engaged in one night stands with women,[382] some of whom were specially 
selected for him while visiting foreign allies.[383] His sister Juanita 
Castro has been living in the United States since the early 1960s, and 
is an opponent of her brother's regime.[384] While in power, Castro's two 
closest male friends were the former Mayor of Havana Pepin Naranjo and 
his own personal physician, René Vallejo.[373] From 1980 until his death 
in 1995, Naranjo headed Castro's team of advisers.[385] Castro also had 
a deep friendship with fellow revolutionary Celia Sanchez, who accompanied 
him almost everywhere during the 1960s, and controlled almost all access 
to the leader.[386] Castro was also a good friend of the Colombian novelist 
Gabriel García Márquez.[387] Within Cuba, Fidel's domination of every aspect 
of the government and the society remains total. His personal needs for 
absolute control seems to have changed little over the years. He remains 
committed to a disciplined society in which he is still determined to remake 
the Cuban national character, creating work-orientated, socially concerned 
individuals... He wants to increase people's standard of living, the availability 
of material goods, and to import the latest technology. But the economic 
realities, despite rapid dramatic growth in the gross national product, 
severely limit what Cuba can buy on the world market. Historian and journalist 
Richard Gott considered Castro to be "one of the most extraordinary political 
figures of the twentieth century", noting that he had become a "world hero 
in the mould of Garibaldi" to people throughout the developing world for 
his anti-imperialist efforts.[389] Bourne described Castro as "an influential 
world leader" who commanded "great respect" from individuals of all political 
ideologies across the developing world.[388] Wayne S. Smith, former Chief 
of the US Interests Section in Havana, noted that in the early 21st century, 
Castro was met with "warm applause" throughout the Western Hemisphere due 
to his opposition to U.S. socio-political dominance and for transforming 
Cuba from a "banana republic" into a nation with significant international 
influence.[351] He has been awarded a wide variety of awards and honors 
from foreign governments, and has been cited as an inspiration for foreign 
leaders like Ahmed Ben Bella,[390] and Nelson Mandela,[391] who subsequently 
awarded him South Africa's highest civilian award for foreigners, the Order 
of Good Hope.[392] Bolivian President Evo Morales described him as "the 
grandfather of all Latin American revolutionaries",[393] while biographer 
Volka Skierka stated that "he will go down in history as one of the few 
revolutionaries who remained true to his principles."[394] Castro has been 
heavily criticized by governments and human rights organizations in the 
Western world, and was widely despised throughout the U.S.[395] He has 
been widely described as a "dictator",[a] although Castro has publicly 
refuted this label, stating that he constitutionally held less power than 
most heads of state and insisting that his regime allowed for greater democratic 
involvement in policy making than Western liberal democracies.[398] Nevertheless, 
critics claim that Castro wielded significant unofficial influence aside 
from his official duties.[399] Quirk stated that Castro wielded "absolute 
power" in Cuba, albeit not in a legal or constitutional manner,[400] while 
Bourne claimed that power in Cuba was "completely invested" in Castro,[401] 
adding that it was very rare for "a country and a people" to have been 
so completely dominated by "the personality of one man".[402] Sondrol suggested 
that in leading "a political system largely [of] his own creation and bearing 
his indelible stamp" Castro's leadership style warranted comparisons with 
other totalitarian leaders like Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, 
and Benito Mussolini.[403] Human rights advocacy groups have criticized 
Castro's administration for committing human rights abuses. Human Rights 
Watch stated that his government constructed a "repressive machinery" which 
deprived Cubans of their "basic rights".[404] Castro has defended his government's 
record on human rights, stating that the state must limit the freedoms 
of individuals and imprison those involved in counter-revolutionary activity 
in order to protect the rights of the collective populace, such as the
