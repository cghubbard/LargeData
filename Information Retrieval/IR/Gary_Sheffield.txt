Gary Antonian Sheffield (born November 18, 1968) is an American retired 
Major League Baseball outfielder. He played with eight teams in the major 
leagues from 1988 to 2009. He currently works as a sports agent. For most 
of his career, Sheffield played right field, though he has also played 
left field, third base, shortstop, and a handful of games at first base. 
He played for the Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, Florida Marlins, 
Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, New York Yankees, Detroit Tigers, 
and the New York Mets. Sheffield was a first-round pick of the Brewers, 
who selected him sixth overall in the 1986 amateur draft after a standout 
prep career at Hillsborough High School in Tampa, Florida. He bats and 
throws right-handed. At the start of the 2010 season, Sheffield ranked 
second among all active players in walks (1,475), third in runs (1,636), 
fourth in RBIs (1,676), fifth in hits (2,689) and home runs (509), and 
sixth in hit by pitches (135). Sheffield hit his 500th home run on April 
17, 2009. He is the nephew of Dwight Gooden. After retirement, he started 
to work as an agent. His current clients include Toronto Blue Jays reliever 
Jason Grilli. Sheffield was born in Tampa, Florida, and grew up in Belmont 
Heights, near the Ponce de Leon projects.[1] He and his family lived with 
his uncle, Dwight Gooden, who would go on to become the ace pitcher for 
the New York Mets. They played baseball frequently and Sheffield learned 
how to hit a fastball from Gooden,[1] who is only four years older than 
he is. Sheffield has publicly said that his grandfather had a significant 
positive impact on his life, influencing him as a person and as an athlete. 
Sheffield was a good hitter in the Little Leagues. However, Sheffield had 
problems with his temper and attitude, which would continue in the Major 
Leagues. Once, when he was late to practice, his coach benched him and 
Sheffield picked up a bat and chased the coach all over the field, resulting 
in him being kicked off the team for a year.[1] When Sheffield was eleven, 
he was selected to the Belmont Heights Little League All-Stars, which included 
future Chicago Cubs #1 pick Ty Griffin, future Major Leaguer Derek Bell, 
and other future MLB players.[1] The team made it to the Little League 
World Series finals, but lost to Taiwan 4–3. He set a record for doubles 
that would be broken in 2012 by Bradley Smith. In 1983, Sheffield made 
the Hillsborough High School varsity baseball team. During his junior year, 
he bulked up to 175 pounds and was a pitcher and third baseman.[1] During 
his senior year, his fastball reached the upper 80's and he frequently 
showed home run power. As a batter, Sheffield hit .500 and 15 home runs, 
in only 62 official at-bats.[1] At the end of the season he was named the 
Gatorade National Player of the Year.[1] After high school, the Milwaukee 
Brewers drafted Sheffield with the sixth pick of the first round of the 
1986 MLB draft.[2] After being drafted he was shipped to Helena of the 
Pioneer League, where he had a .365 batting average and 71 RBIs in 57 games. 
The only question was what position he would play. He was slotted at shortstop, 
but struggled at the position, committing many errors and wild throws. 
In 1987, he was assigned to Stockton of the Class-A California League, 
where his defense improved and he produced at the plate. His batting average 
went below .300, but he led the league in RBIs with 103, and at the end 
of the year he was voted the Brewers' best prospect. In his third season, 
he went from Double-A to the majors. In 134 games for the El Paso Diablos 
and Denver, he batted .327 with 28 homers and 118 RBIs and was considered 
ready for the majors. Sheffield was called up from the minors when rosters 
were expanded in September and made his major league debut on September 
3, 1988. As a teenager, he got off to a fast start, with his first career 
hit being a home run off Mark Langston, though Sheffield finished the season 
with a .238 batting average and four home runs in 24 games. After a decline 
in play and several injuries, he found himself competing with Bill Spiers 
in a race for starting shortstop. After this, he was moved to third base 
and criticized the team, saying it was a black and white issue.[3] At the 
end of the 1989 season, he batted .247 with five home runs and 32 RBIs. 
In 1990, he worked under Don Baylor, who had been hired as their hitting 
coach. He finished the season batting .294, with 10 home runs. While his 
playing improved, there were issues with Sheffield in the clubhouse, and 
went as far as accusing the organization of being racist after keeping 
him at third instead of playing him at shortstop where the white Spiers 
played.[4] In his final season with the Brewers, he injured his wrist, 
thumb, and shoulder, playing in only 50 games.[1] After four seasons in 
Milwaukee, the Brewers traded Sheffield to the San Diego Padres for Ricky 
Bones, José Valentin, and Matt Mieske on March 26, 1992. Sheffield faced 
his uncle Dwight Gooden for the first time in a Major League game on May 
12, 1992, getting a hit in three at-bats. In his first All-Star season, 
he contended for the Triple Crown for much of the year; while he missed 
out on the home run (33, two fewer than the leader, teammate Fred McGriff) 
and RBIs (100, nine fewer than leader Darren Daulton) titles, he won the 
National League batting title (the only one of the nine in Padre history 
not won by Tony Gwynn) with a .330 average. In 1993, he started the season 
by hitting 10 home runs and batting .295 and was traded in midseason to 
the Florida Marlins. On June 24, 1993, he was traded, with Rich Rodriguez, 
to the Florida Marlins for Trevor Hoffman, José Martínez and Andrés Berumen. 
He finished the season hitting 10 home runs, batting .292 and knocking 
in 37 runs while with the Marlins, and was the starting third baseman for 
the NL in the All-Star Game. At the end of the season, the Marlins gave 
him a four-year deal that made him the highest-paid player at third base.[5] 
During the 1994 season, the Marlins moved him from third base to right 
field, where he showed great success with an impressive arm. Sheffield 
hit 112 home runs with the Marlins from 1994 to 1998, including 42 in 1996, 
making the All-Star Game in 1996, and leading them to victory in the 1997 
World Series against the Cleveland Indians. He was traded to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in 1998 because the Marlins allegedly could not afford a contract 
extension and because the Dodgers' parent company at the time, News Corporation, 
was looking to secure a television contract with the Marlins in exchange 
for trading popular Dodger Mike Piazza.[1] On May 14, 1998, he was traded 
along with Manuel Barrios, Charles Johnson, Bobby Bonilla, and Jim Eisenreich 
to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile. Sheffield finished 
the season with the Dodgers batting .316 and hitting 16 homers while driving 
in 57 runs. In 3½ seasons with the Dodgers, he hit 129 home runs and drove 
in 367 runs. He made three All-Star games while playing with the Dodgers 
and had become one of the best outfielders in the game. But during the 
offseason, he began lobbying for a trade because he thought the Dodgers 
were spending their money stupidly and sliding in the wrong direction, 
and publicly criticized coaches and teammates.[1] On January 15, 2002, 
Sheffield was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Brian Jordan, Odalis Pérez, 
and Andrew Brown. He spent two seasons with the Braves hitting 64 home 
runs and knocking in 216 RBIs including 132 in 2003. After two seasons 
with the Braves, he became a free agent for the first time in his long 
career on October 27, 2003. On December 19, 2003, after negotiations between 
Sheffield and George Steinbrenner, a contract was agreed upon with the 
New York Yankees worth $39 million over three years. This deal included 
$13.5 million in deferred money and a $13 million team option for 2007.[6] 
He joined a lineup that included Derek Jeter, Jason Giambi and the newly 
acquired Alex Rodriguez. In his first season with the Yankees, Sheffield 
started slowly, but finished the season with 36 home runs, 121 RBIs, and 
a .290 batting average, helping him finish second in the MVP voting behind 
Vladimir Guerrero. In his second season with the Yankees, he continued 
to play well, hitting another 34 home runs and driving in 123 runs. Sheffield 
started the 2006 season on pace for a .300 batting average and 30 homers, 
before he collided with Shea Hillenbrand of the Toronto Blue Jays on April 
29, 2006. He tried to play despite the injury, but ultimately needed wrist 
surgery. Sheffield did not return until late September. He had lost his 
right field job to Bobby Abreu, whom the Yankees had acquired in a trade 
deadline transaction. At the end of the 2006 season, the Yankees picked 
up Sheffield's 2007 option and traded him to the Detroit Tigers. On November 
10, 2006, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers for minor league pitchers 
Humberto Sánchez, Kevin Whelan, and Anthony Claggett. After the trade, 
Sheffield agreed to a two-year, $28 million extension.[7] In his first 
season with the Tigers, he hit 25 home runs, with 75 RBIs, and a .265 batting 
average. Sheffield also hit his first triple since 2004 and stole 20 bases 
for the first time since 1990. He was also one of only six batters in the 
AL to have at least 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases, along with Alex Rodriguez, 
Grady Sizemore, Ian Kinsler, B.J. Upton and former teammate Curtis Granderson. 
On September 8, 2008 in a game against Oakland, Sheffield hit the 250,000th 
regular season home run in Major League Baseball history according to Baseball-Reference.com. 
The home run was a grand slam off Gio Gonzalez;[8] Sheffield had hit baseball's 
249,999th home run against Gonzalez in his previous at-bat. Sheffield ended 
the 2008 season with 499 home runs. On March 31, 2009, Sheffield was released 
by the Tigers despite being owed $14M. The Tigers said in a statement that 
they wanted to have more versatility with the DH position.[9] On April 
3, Sheffield agreed to a deal with the New York Mets for the 2009 season,[10] 
and he finalized the deal the following day.[11] On April 17, Sheffield 
hit his 500th home run in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers, becoming 
the 25th player in MLB history to reach that milestone, the first player 
to achieve this as a pinch hitter, and the first to do so in a Mets uniform.[12] 
Sheffield would also become the third player in Major League history to 
hit home runs before age 20 and after age 40, joining Ty Cobb and Rusty 
Staub. Alex Rodriguez became the fourth player to do so in 2015.[13] Sheffield 
sat out a game in August when the Mets declined to offer him a contract 
extension.[14] Sheffield did not play in 2010. Though he initially suggested 
he wanted to sign with a team for the 2011 season,[15] he announced his 
retirement at the beginning of 2011 spring training.[16] In 1987, Sheffield 
and his uncle, MLB player Dwight Gooden, were arrested after fighting with 
police and resisting arrest in Tampa, Florida.[22] He was verbal about 
his need for sufficient financial compensation and respect, demanding better 
pay when he was with the Dodgers, and refusing to play in the inaugural 
World Baseball Classic, saying "[his] season is when [he's] getting paid."[23] 
On April 14, 2005, a Red Sox fan leaned over the railing at Fenway Park 
and swiped at Sheffield as he was going to field a ball hit by Jason Varitek. 
After Sheffield took a swing at him with his glove, he threw the ball back 
into the infield, and then got into a verbal altercation with him. The 
fan, who was under the influence of alcohol, was ejected from Fenway Park 
and his 2005 season tickets were revoked. Sheffield was fined for the incident. 
Charges were dismissed against both the fan and Sheffield.[24] In the June 
2007 issue of GQ magazine, Sheffield (a Detroit Tiger at the time) was 
quoted saying that there are more Latin baseball players than African-American 
players because Latinos are easier to control. "What I said is that you're 
going to see more black faces, but there ain't no English going to be coming 
out. ... (It's about) being able to tell (Latin players) what to do — being 
able to control them.... Where I'm from, you can't control us." He continued 
"They have more to lose than we do. You can send them back across the island. 
You can't send us back. We're already here."[25] During an July 2007 interview 
with HBO's Real Sports, Sheffield said that Yankees manager Joe Torre treated 
black players differently from white players during his time there, citing 
himself, Kenny Lofton and Tony Womack as examples. Lofton later agreed 
with Sheffield's comments about being treated differently, but disagreed 
that race was the motivating factor. After it was pointed out that Derek 
Jeter is biracial, Sheffield responded that he wasn't "all the way black."[26] 
On September 19, 2008, Sheffield was hit by a pitch from Cleveland Indians 
pitcher Roberto Heredia Hernández (pitching under the name Fausto Carmona 
at that time) and walked to first base. When Hernández (Carmona) threw 
to first base, he and Sheffield exchanged words and Sheffield charged the 
mound, attempting to tackle Hernández but was caught in a headlock and 
punched a few times on the top of his head by the young pitcher, leading 
to a bench-clearing brawl. Hernández and Sheffield were both ejected, along 
with Indians catcher Víctor Martínez and Tigers second baseman Plácido 
Polanco.[27] On September 22, the commissioner's office announced four 
suspensions resulting from the brawl: Hernández was suspended for six games, 
Sheffield received a four-game suspension, and Martinez and Indians infielder 
Asdrúbal Cabrera each received three-game suspensions. Sheffield made statements 
after the suspension that the involved players from the Indians would be 
"penalized" by him as well.[28] During a workout with Barry Bonds in 2001, 
a cream was applied to Sheffield's knee by a trainer to help heal ripped 
stitches from a knee surgery. Sheffield states in his book, Inside Power, 
that he had no knowledge of the cream containing steroids, and had no reason 
to assume so at the time. He goes on to say in his book that the cream 
did nothing to strengthen his knee, and also states that a look at his 
numbers shows no improvement after the incident. [29] On December 13, 2007, 
Sheffield was named in the Mitchell Report as one of the players who had 
obtained and used steroids.[30] He and his wife Deleon reside in Tampa, 
Florida. They have three sons. Sheffield has four other children from previous 
relationships. Deleon is a gospel recording artist and has sung the National 
Anthem at both the old Yankee Stadium and Dodger Stadium. In October 1995, 
Sheffield was shot in his left shoulder after an attempted robbery when 
he stopped his car at a traffic light.[31] Italics denotes active player
