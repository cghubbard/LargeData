A varsity letter (or monogram) is an award earned in the United States 
for excellence in school activities. A varsity letter signifies that its 
winner was a qualified varsity team member, awarded after a certain standard 
was met. The award letter is usually made in the colors and initials representing 
the school that the recipient attends. The letter patch is primarily constructed 
of chenille and felt materials. Standard sizes range from 4 inches (102 mm) 
to 8 inches (203 mm). While 4 inches (102 mm) and 5 inches (127 mm) usually 
denote Junior Varsity achievements, 6 inches (152 mm) to 8 inches (203 mm) 
would denote full (Senior) Varsity. The stitching style used for creating 
the chenille look is called a moss stitch, while the outlining sew down 
is called a chain stitch. With the advent of organized sports, there was 
a need for uniforms. There was an additional need for identifications which 
was satisfied by the use of emblems or letters. In 1865, the Harvard baseball 
team added an Old English 'H'. The 'H' was embroidered on the gray flannel 
shirt. The football team started to use the 'H' in 1875. For 25 years following 
the introduction in 1865 of the letter, it was the practice for the team 
captain to allow certain players who played in the most important games 
(Yale or Princeton) to keep the 'H' jerseys as an award. If a player did 
not play in an important game, the player had to return the jersey at the 
end of the season. Awarding the 'H' jersey may have been the birth of the 
varsity letter as an award. The letterman sweater was first regularly used 
by the 1891 "Nine" (baseball) and was black with a small Crimson 'H' on 
the left breast. It is not known when the letter sweater came to high schools. 
The earliest known example of a letter sweater in a high school is found 
in the 1911 yearbook of Phoenix Union High School, Arizona Territory. Pictured, 
not in football uniform, wearing a V-net sweater with the letter 'P' on 
the left side, is a student in a group photo. The sweater seems to be the 
home of the award letter from the 1890s until the 1930s. Another award 
during the 1920s and 1930s was a stadium style blanket given as an award. 
In the 1930s, the letter award started to appear on leather sleeved, wool-bodied 
jackets. The jackets from the 1930s were different in design than today's 
modern jacket.[1] As a decorative clothing item, the varsity letter has 
a huge number of variations and no set standard is made to any school on 
how it should look. Chenille letters come in many different forms and shapes. 
Some institutions use Old English or script style, two or three letter 
monogram, 3D shading, chenille bordered or the traditional straight block 
style. Students generally receive only one actual letter, but can win the 
distinction multiple times. These additional designations are shown by 
adding embroidered sport insignias, modeled metal insert pins, or bars 
that are attached to the letter. Some schools may embroider non-athletic 
letters with their award title, such as "Academics" or "Arts”. Old English 
style letter with embroidered music insert Two-letter monogram with embroidered 
academic insert Three-letter monogram Chenille bordered letter with embroidered 
mascot and sport inserts Letter with 3D shading Traditional block letter 
with embroidered mascot The chenille letter is traditionally placed on 
the left chest of the varsity jacket, which is also at times adorned with 
championship chenille patches showcasing the team or individual accomplishments. 
School mascot patches are also commonly used. During the 1980s, and again 
in the 2010s, Varsity Jackets have been adopted into Hip-hop fashion, with 
companies such as Avirex, Phat Farm and Rocawear making their own variations.[2]
