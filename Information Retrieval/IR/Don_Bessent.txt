Fred Donald Bessent (March 13, 1931 – July 7, 1990) was a pitcher in Major 
League Baseball. He pitched from 1955 to 1958 with the Brooklyn/Los Angeles 
Dodgers. He was signed by the New York Yankees out of high school, and 
in his first professional season he pitched a no-hitter[1] while going 
22–7 in Class D. The following season, he moved up to the Class B Norfolk 
Tars and went 11–2 with a 2.04 earned run average.[2] Bessent then developed 
a spinal condition and was unable to pitch in 1952. He underwent surgery 
and was subsequently drafted by the Dodgers. From 1953 to 1955, Bessent

up to the majors in July 1955 and immediately pitched well. That season, 
he went 8–1 with a 2.70 ERA, mostly coming out of the bullpen. He also 
pitched 3 1⁄3 scoreless innings in the 1955 World Series, and the Dodgers 
won their first championship. Bessent pitched just as well in 1956, going 
4–3 with nine saves and a 2.50 ERA. The Dodgers won another National League 
pennant but lost the World Series to the New York Yankees, despite Bessent's 
win in Game 2. He pitched the final seven innings of an 13–8 slugfest after 
both teams' starting pitchers were knocked out in the second inning. In 
1957, he dropped off sharply, posting a 5.73 ERA in 44 innings. He began 
to develop arm problems shortly afterwards and played his final major league 
game in September 1958. He retired in 1962, after several unsuccessful 
seasons in the minors.[3] Bessent returned to Jacksonville and became a
