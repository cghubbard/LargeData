He grew up in Merced, California where he began playing baseball at the 
age of six.[2] He was a fan of both the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco 
Giants as a child.[3] His favorite player was Cal Ripken, Jr.[3] Fister 
also played soccer, football and basketball as a child.[2] He shares a 
middle name (Wildes) with both his father and grandfather.[2] Fister attended 
Golden Valley High School where he pitched and was the team's utility player.[1] 
He was a two-year letterman and a first-team All-Central California Conference 
selection in his senior season,[1] batting .456 with a home run and 12 
runs batted in (RBIs).[1] He was also named a first team all-conference 
selection in basketball, averaging over 30 points per game as a senior. 
He and former MLB catcher Dusty Ryan graduated in the same class. Fister 
attended Merced College from 2003 to 2004. At Merced, he was a two-year 
letterman and participated in the 2003 Junior College All-Star Game.[1] 
In 2003, he was a preseason All-American.[1] Fister was drafted by the 
San Francisco Giants in the 49th round of the 2004 Major League Baseball 
draft but chose to transfer to Division I Fresno State University, where 
he played for the Bulldogs. In 2005, Fister led Fresno State with wins 
(7) and was second on the team in innings pitched (93 2⁄3) and strikeouts 
(77).[1] He also appeared in 26 games at first base in 2005. That season, 
he was drafted by the New York Yankees in the sixth round but chose to 
stay at Fresno State for his senior season. In 2006, Fister had an 8-6 
record and a 4.10 earned run average in 20 games. Following the season, 
Fister was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the seventh round of the 
2006 Major League Baseball draft. Fister was selected by the Seattle Mariners 
in the seventh round of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft, and signed 
on June 10, 2006.[4] He began his professional career that season with 
the Class-A Short-Season Everett AquaSox of the Northwest League. Fister 
went 3–5 with a 2.25 ERA, four saves, and 35 strikeouts in 20 games; four 
starts. He was first on the AquaSox in games finished (13), and ERA; tied 
for second in saves, and wins; and was third among pitchers in games played 
(20).[5] The next season, 2007, Fister played with the Double-A West Tenn 
Diamond Jaxx of the Southern League. That season, he went 7–8 with a 4.60 
ERA, one complete game, and 85 strikeouts in 24 games, all starts. Fister 
led the Diamond Jaxx pitching staff in wins, and home runs allowed (14); 
was tied for first in complete games; was second in hits allowed (156); 
and was third in losses, games started, innings pitched (131), runs allowed 
(78), and earned runs allowed (67).[6] Fister continued to play for the 
Double-A West Tenn Diamond Jaxx in 2008. On April 23, Fister was named 
the Southern League Pitcher of the Week.[7] Fister became the Southern 
League's first 10-game loser on July 10.[8] On the season, Fister went 
6–14 with a 5.43 ERA, and 104 strikeouts in 31 games; 23 starts. Fister 
was first among Diamond Jaxx pitchers in losses, games started, innings 
pitched (134 1⁄3), hits allowed (155), runs allowed (95), earned runs allowed 
(81), home runs allowed (12); and was second in wins, bases on balls (walks)

in runs allowed; and was second in losses, and earned runs allowed.[10] 
At the end of the 2008 regular season, Fister played in the Arizona Fall 
League (AFL) with the Peoria Javelinas.[11] In the AFL, Fister was involved 
in no decisions with a 3.32 ERA, and 22 strikeouts in 11 games, all in 
relief. In 2009, Fister began the season with the Double-A West Tenn Diamond 
Jaxx for the third time in his career. However, he was later promoted to 
the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers, and eventually the Seattle Mariners. In just 
two games with the Diamond Jaxx, Fister went 1–0 and gave-up no earned 
runs. With the Rainiers, Fister went 6–4 with a 3.81 ERA, and 79 strikeouts 
in 22 games, 17 starts. On August 7, Fister was promoted to the majors.[12] 
As a result, pitcher Jason Vargas was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma to make 
room for Fister on the Mariners' 25-man roster.[12] In his major league 
debut against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 8, Fister pitched one inning, 
struck out one, gave up one hit, and gave up one walk.[13] He made his 
first start on August 11 against the Chicago White Sox and picked up the 
loss.[14] Fister's first win came on August 16 against the New York Yankees.[15] 
Fister finished the season with a major league record of 3–4 with a 4.13 
ERA, and 36 strikeouts in 11 games, 10 starts. In 2010, Fister started 
the first game for the Mariners in spring training.[16] Going into the 
season, Fister, and fellow starting pitchers Garrett Olson, Luke French 
and Jason Vargas competed for the Mariners' fifth spot in the starting 
rotation.[17] Fister ended up getting a job in the rotation (as did Vargas). 
On April 19, Fister took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the 
Baltimore Orioles until it was broken up by Nick Markakis' leadoff single.[18] 
Although the Mariners suffered early season woes, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer 
praised Fister and fellow starter Jason Vargas as reasons for why the Mariners 
were not doing worse, stating, "If Doug Fister and Jason Vargas hadn't 
been excellent at the back end of the rotation, God knows where this club 
would be."[19] In 2011, Fister was the Mariners' number three starter behind 
Félix Hernández and Jason Vargas. On July 30, 2011, Fister was traded to 
the Detroit Tigers along with relief pitcher David Pauley in exchange for 
Casper Wells, Charlie Furbush, Francisco Martinez, and a player to be named 
later. On August 17, the Tigers sent former first round pick Chance Ruffin 
to the Mariners to complete the trade.[20] Before being dealt to the Detroit 
Tigers, Fister had a 3–12 record with a 3.33 ERA in 21 starts. After his 
trade to the Tigers, Fister went 8–1 with a 1.79 ERA in 10 starts.[21] 
He finished the 2011 regular season 11–13, with an ERA of 2.83 that placed 
him fourth among American League pitchers.[22] Fister was named the American 
League Pitcher of the Month for September after going 5–0 with a 0.53 ERA 
in five starts.[23] Facing the New York Yankees in the American League 
Divisional Series, Fister bounced back from a rough game 1 outing to earn 
the win in the decisive game 5. Fister limited the Yankees to one run on 
five hits and two walks over five innings in the Tigers 3–2 victory, which 
sent them to the American League Championship Series.[24] In Game 3 of 
the American League Championship Series, he held the Texas Rangers' offense 
to two runs in 7 1⁄3 innings to get the win in a 5–2 Tigers victory.[25] 
On April 7 while pitching against the Red Sox, Fister left the game due 
to an injury.[26] The next day, Fister was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list with a strain of the costochondral muscle in his left side, an injury 
to the ribcage. Brayan Villarreal was recalled from Triple-A Toledo to 
take his place on the roster.[27] On September 22, Fister threw his first 
career shutout, blanking the Minnesota Twins 8-0 on seven hits.[28] In 
his next start on September 27, Doug set an American League record by striking 
out nine batters in a row against the Kansas City Royals. This was just 
one short of the major league record (10) set by Tom Seaver in 1970.[29] 
He finished the 2012 regular season with a 10-10 record and a 3.45 ERA 
in 26 starts. Fister pitched in the second game of the ALDS against the 
Oakland A's, picking up a no decision in a 5–4 victory while giving up 
two runs in seven innings.[30] He also got a no-decision in Game 1 of the 
2012 ALCS against the New York Yankees, despite surrendering no runs in 
6 1⁄3 innings of work.[31] Fister was struck in the head by a line drive 
off the bat of Giants outfielder Gregor Blanco during the second inning 
of Game 2 of the 2012 World Series. Fister continued to pitch the game, 
holding the Giants to one run over six innings before turning it over to 
the bullpen.[32] Fister was injury-free in 2013, making 32 starts for the 
Tigers. He set career highs in wins (14), win percentage (14-9, .609) and 
strikeouts (159), while finishing the regular season with a 3.67 ERA. Doug 
made a start in Game 4 of the 2013 ALDS against the Oakland Athletics, 
with the Tigers facing elimination. He gave up three runs and seven hits 
in six innings of work. The Tigers won the game with a late rally, so Fister 
did not factor in the decision.[33] In Game 4 of the 2013 ALCS against 
the Boston Red Sox, Fister gave up just one run on eight hits, striking 
out seven over six innings and earning the win in a 7-3 Tigers victory.[34] 
Following the 2013 season, Fister was named a finalist for the Gold Glove 
Award for the pitcher position alongside Mark Buehrle and R.A. Dickey.[35] 
Fister finished the season with zero errors for a perfect 1.000 fielding 
percentage. Additionally, he led all American League pitchers in putouts 
(23) and double plays started (5), and was seventh in assists (29).[36] 
On December 2, 2013, Doug Fister was traded to the Washington Nationals 
for utility man Steve Lombardozzi and left handed pitchers Ian Krol and 
Robbie Ray.[37] During spring training with the Nationals, Doug developed 
a strained lat muscle on his right side that put him on the disabled list 
to start the 2014 season. He returned on May 9 against the Oakland Athletics 
where he gave up 5 earned runs on 9 hits in 4.1 innings. He bounced back 
in his next start, against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Fister gave up just 
1 earned run on 5 hits in 7 innings. Fister would conclude the 2014 season 
with a 16-6 record over 164 IP, tallying 98 strikeouts, a 1.08 WHIP (5th 
in the NL among qualified starters), and a 2.41 ERA (4th in the NL).[38] 
Fister pitched in 25 games for the Nationals in 2015, 15 of which were 
starts. He posted a 5–7 record, 4.19 ERA, and 63 strikeouts in 103 innings 
pitched.[39] On January 28, 2016, Fister signed a one-year, $7 million 
contract with the Houston Astros.[40] Fister throws four pitches, and is 
mainly a groundball pitcher. His two seam fastball is thrown at 88–91 mph. 
His other pitches are a cutter (85–87), a curveball (73–79), and a changeup 
(80–84). The curveball is his best swing-and-miss pitch, with a career 
whiff rate of over 30%. Fister walks few batters; he finished third and 
fourth in 2010 and 2011, respectively, in lowest walks per nine innings 
ratio.[41] Fister runs 10 miles each day that he does not pitch.[42] Fister 
stands 6 feet 8 inches tall, and is among the tallest players in the Major
