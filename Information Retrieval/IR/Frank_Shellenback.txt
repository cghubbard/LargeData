Frank Victor Shellenback (December 16, 1898 – August 17, 1969) was an American 
pitcher, pitching coach, and scout in Major League Baseball. As a pitcher, 
he was famous as an expert spitballer when the pitch was still legal in 
organized baseball; however, because Shellenback, then 21, was on a minor 
league roster when the spitball was outlawed after the 1919 season, he 
was banned from throwing the pitch in the Major Leagues.[1][2] As a result, 
Shellenback spent 19 years (1920–38) — the remainder of his active career 
— throwing the spitball legally in the Pacific Coast League. He won a record 
295 PCL games. Shellenback was a native of Joplin, Missouri, and grew up 
in Los Angeles. He threw and batted right-handed and stood 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) 
(188 cm) tall and weighed 200 pounds (91 kg). He became a professional 
baseball player during World War I and was acquired by the Chicago White 
Sox at age 19 during the 1918 season. In 36 American League games during 
1918–19, Shellenback won 11 games and lost 15, with an earned run average 
of 3.06 in 217 2⁄3 innings pitched. He appeared in his last MLB game on 
July 5, 1919, before his contract was transferred to the Minneapolis Millers 
of the American Association. Although Shellenback posted a 7–3 record there, 
because of the spitball ban and his minor league status at the time, he 
would never again pitch in the Majors. Minneapolis sent Shellenback to 
the Vernon Tigers of the Pacific Coast League at the close of the 1919 
campaign, and Shellenback began his long career in the circuit. He would 
hurl for Vernon, the Sacramento Solons, Hollywood Stars, and San Diego 
Padres, and win more than 20 games five times, with two 18-game and three 
19-game winning seasons as well. All told, as a minor league pitcher, Shellenback 
won 315 games and lost 192 (for a winning percentage of .621), with an 
ERA of 3.55 over 4,514 1⁄3 innings.[3] Shellenback's long tenure with Los 
Angeles-based teams even led to a brief movie career; he had roles in the 
comedies Fireman, Save My Child (1932) and Alibi Ike (1935).[4] Both films 
starred comedian and baseball enthusiast Joe E. Brown, whose son would 
become known as a successful baseball executive. Shellenback had a long 
career as a manager, coach, and scout as well. In 1935, still an active 
pitcher, he took over the managerial reins of the Stars and moved with 
them to San Diego the following season. There, in 1936, he helped discover 
and groom one of the greatest hitters of all time, Ted Williams, who signed 
with the Padres as a 17-year-old pitcher-outfielder out of San Diego's 
Hoover High School. Williams was soon acquired by the Boston Red Sox, while 
Shellenback remained manager of the Padres through 1938, winning the 1937 
PCL championship. He then became a pitching coach for the St. Louis Browns 
(1939), Red Sox (1940–44), Detroit Tigers (1946–47), and New York Giants 
(1950–55), working on two pennant winners and one World Series champion 
with the Giants of Leo Durocher. During this time, Shellenback was elected 
to the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame in 1943. Shellenback became a 
Giants scout in 1956 and continued in that role until his death at age
