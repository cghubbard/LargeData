Warren Edward Spahn (April 23, 1921 – November 24, 2003) was a Major League 
Baseball left-handed pitcher who played his entire 21-year baseball career 
in the National League. He won 20 games or more in 13 seasons, including 
a 23–7 record when he was age 42. Spahn was the 1957 Cy Young Award winner, 
and was the runner-up three times, all during the period when one award 
was given, covering both leagues. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of 
Fame in 1973, with 83% of the total vote.(His eligibility was delayed, 
under the rules of the time, by two years of token minor league play.) 
Spahn won 363 games, more than any other left-handed pitcher in history, 
and more than any other pitcher who played his entire career in the post-1920 
live-ball era. He is acknowledged as one of the best pitchers in Major 
League Baseball history. The Warren Spahn Award, given to the major leagues' 
best left-handed pitcher, is named after him. Regarded as a "thinking man's" 
pitcher who liked to outwit batters, Spahn once described his approach 
on the mound: "Hitting is timing. Pitching is upsetting timing."[1] His 
major league career began in 1942 with the Braves and he spent all but 
one year with that franchise, first in Boston and then in Milwaukee. He 
finished his career in 1965 with the New York Mets and the San Francisco 
Giants. With 363 wins, Spahn is the 6th most winning pitcher in history, 
trailing only Cy Young (511), Walter Johnson (417), Grover Cleveland Alexander 
(373), Christy Mathewson (373), and Pud Galvin (364) on MLB's all-time 
list. He led the league in wins eight times (1949–50, 1953, 1957–61, each 
season with 20+ wins) and won at least 20 games an additional five times 
(1947, 1951, 1954, 1956, 1963). Spahn also threw two no-hitters (in 1960 
and 1961, at ages 39 and 40), won 3 ERA titles (1947, 1953, and 1961), 
and four strikeout crowns (1949–52). He appeared in 14 All-Star Games, 
the most of any pitcher in the 20th century. He won the NL Player of the 
Month Award in August 1960 (6-0, 2.30 ERA, 32 SO) and August 1961 (6-0, 
1.00 ERA, 26 SO) Spahn acquired the nickname "Hooks", not so much because 
of his pitching, but due to the prominent shape of his nose. He had once 
been hit in the face by a thrown ball that he was not expecting, and his 
broken nose settled into a hook-like shape. In Spahn's final season, during 
his stint with the Mets, Yogi Berra came out of retirement briefly and 
caught 4 games, one of them with Spahn pitching. Yogi later told reporters, 
"I don't think we're the oldest battery, but we're certainly the ugliest." 
Spahn was known for a very high leg kick in his delivery, as was his later 
Giants teammate Juan Marichal.[citation needed] Photo sequences show that 
this high kick served a specific purpose. As a left-hander, Spahn was able 
not only to watch any runner on first base, but also to not telegraph whether 
he was delivering to the plate or to first base, thereby forcing the runner 
to stay close to the bag. As his fastball waned, Spahn adapted, and relied 
more on location, changing speeds and a good screwball. He led or shared 
the lead in the NL in wins in 1957–61 (age 36 through 40). Spahn was also 
a good hitter, hitting at least one home run in 17 straight seasons, and 
finishing with an NL career record for pitchers, with 35 home runs. Wes 
Ferrell, who spent most of his time in the American League, holds the overall 
record for pitchers, with 37. First signed by the Boston Braves before 
the 1940 season, Spahn reached the major leagues in 1942 at the age of 
20. He clashed with Braves manager Casey Stengel, who sent him to the minors 
after Spahn refused to throw at Brooklyn Dodger batter Pee Wee Reese in 
an exhibition game.[2] Spahn had pitched in only 4 games, allowing 15 runs 
(10 earned) in 15 2⁄3 innings. Stengel later said that it was the worst 
managing mistake he had ever made: I said "no guts" to a kid who went on 
to become a war hero and one of the greatest lefthanded pitchers you ever 
saw. You can't say I don't miss 'em when I miss 'em. The 1942 Braves finished 
next to last, and Stengel was fired the following year. Spahn was reunited 
with his first manager 23 years later, for the even more woeful last-place 
New York Mets, and—referring to Stengel's success with the 1949–60 New 
York Yankees—later quipped, "I'm probably the only guy who played for Casey 
before and after he was a genius."[3] Along with many other major leaguers, 
Spahn chose to enlist in the United States Army, after finishing the 1942 
season in the minors. He served with distinction, and was awarded a Purple 
Heart.[3] He saw action in the Battle of the Bulge and at the Ludendorff 
Bridge as a combat engineer, and was awarded a battlefield commission.[3] 
Spahn returned to the major leagues in 1946 at the age of 25, having missed 
three full seasons. Had he played, it is possible that Spahn would have 
finished his career behind only Walter Johnson and Cy Young in all-time 
wins.[4] Spahn was unsure of the war's impact on his career: People say 
that my absence from the big leagues may have cost me a chance to win 400 
games. But I don't know about that. I matured a lot in three years, and 
I think I was better equipped to handle major league hitters at 25 than 
I was at 22. Also, I pitched until I was 44. Maybe I wouldn't have been 
able to do that otherwise.[3] In 1947, Spahn led the National League in 
ERA while posting a 21–10 record. It was the first of his thirteen 20-win 
seasons. Spahn also won two more ERA titles, in 1953 and 1961. On June 
11, 1950, Spahn and pitcher Bob Rush of the Cubs each stole a base against 
each other; no opposing pitchers again stole a base in the same game until 
May 3, 2004, when Jason Marquis and Greg Maddux repeated the feat.[5][6] 
In 1951, Spahn allowed the first career hit to Willie Mays, a home run. 
Mays had begun his career 0-for-12, and Spahn responded to reporters after 
the game, citing the distance between home plate and the pitcher's mound 
of 60 feet, 6 inches, "Gentlemen, for the first 60 feet, that was a hell 
of a pitch." Spahn joked a long time later, "I'll never forgive myself. 
We might have gotten rid of Willie forever if I'd only struck him out." 
(In 1962, another Hall of Famer hit his first career home run off Spahn: 
Sandy Koufax, who only hit one other.) Spahn's teammate Johnny Sain was 
the ace of the pennant-winning 1948 Braves staff, with a win-loss record 
of 24–15. Spahn went 15–12 while, contrary to legend, teammates Bill Voiselle 
(13–13), and Vern Bickford (11–5) also pitched well.[7] In honor of the 
pitching duo, Boston Post sports editor Gerald V. Hern wrote this poem 
which the popular media eventually condensed to "Spahn and Sain and Pray 
for Rain":[8] First we'll use Spahn then we'll use Sain Then an off day 
followed by rain Back will come Spahn followed by Sain And followed we 
hope by two days of rain. The poem was inspired by the performance of Spahn 
and Sain during the Braves' 1948 pennant drive. The team swept a Labor 
Day doubleheader, with Spahn throwing a complete 14-inning win in the opener, 
and Sain pitching a shutout in the second game. Following two off days, 
it did rain. Spahn won the next day, and Sain won the day after that. Three 
days later, Spahn won again. Sain won the next day. After one more off 
day, the two pitchers were brought back, and won another doubleheader. 
The two pitchers had gone 8–0 in 12 days' time.[3] Other sayings have been 
derived from "Spahn and Sain and pray for rain." For example, some referred 
to the 1993 San Francisco Giants' imbalanced rotation as "Burkett and Swift 
and pray for snow drift."[9] The 1970s California Angels' rotation was 
sometimes known as "Tanana and Ryan and two days of cryin'."[10] In 1957, 
Spahn was the ace of the champion Milwaukee Braves. Spahn pitched on two 
other Braves pennant winners, in 1948 and 1958. He had 2,583 strikeouts, 
which at the time of his retirement was the highest total for a left-handed 
pitcher in baseball history.[11] Spahn led the NL in strikeouts for four 
consecutive seasons, from 1949 to 1952 (tied with Don Newcombe in 1951), 
which includes a single game high of 18 strike outs (then the NL record) 
in a 15-inning appearance on June 14, 1952. For several decades, Spahn's 
Hall of Fame plaque contained a typographical error, crediting him with 
2,853 strikeouts.[12] Spahn maintained that "A pitcher needs two pitches — 
one they're looking for, and one to cross 'em up." He was thus able to 
maintain his position as one of the game's top pitchers until his 19th 
season in the sport. This was exemplified by his start on July 2, 1963. 
Facing the San Francisco Giants, the 42-year-old Spahn became locked into 
a storied pitchers' duel with 25-year-old Juan Marichal. The score was 
still 0–0 after more than four hours when Willie Mays hit a game-winning 
solo home run off Spahn with one out in the bottom of the 16th inning.[13] 
Marichal's manager, Alvin Dark, visited the mound in the 9th, 10th, 11th, 
13th, and 14th innings, and was talked out of removing Marichal each time. 
During the 14th-inning visit, Marichal told Dark, "Do you see that man 
pitching for the other side? Do you know that man is 42 years old? I'm 
only 25. If that man is on the mound, nobody is going to take me out of 
here."[14] Marichal ended up throwing 227 pitches in the complete game 
1–0 win, while Spahn threw 201 in the loss, allowing nine hits and one 
walk. Hall of Famer Carl Hubbell, who was in attendance that night, said 
of Spahn, "He ought to will his body to medical science." Spahn threw his 
first no-hitter against the Phillies 16 September 1960, when he was 39. 
He pitched his second no-hitter the following year, 28 April 1961, against 
the Giants. By the last two seasons of his career, Spahn was the oldest 
active player in baseball. He lost this distinction for a single day: September 
25, 1965, when 58-year-old Satchel Paige pitched three innings.[15] Spahn's 
seemingly ageless ability caused Stan Musial famously to quip, "[Spahn] 
will never get into the Hall of Fame. He won't stop pitching." Following 
the 1964 season, after 25 years with the franchise, Spahn was sold by the 
Braves to the New York Mets. Braves manager Bobby Bragan predicted, "Spahnie 
won't win six games with the Mets." Spahn took on the dual role of pitcher 
and pitching coach. Spahn won four and lost 12 at which point the Mets 
put Spahn on waivers.[16] He was put on waivers on July 15, 1965 and released 
on July 22, 1965. He immediately signed with the San Francisco Giants, 
with whom he finished the season. With the Mets and Giants combined, he 
won seven games for the season—his last in the major leagues. His number 
would be retired by the Braves later that year. Spahn managed the Tulsa 
Oilers for five seasons, winning 372 games from 1967 to 1971. His 1968 
club won the Pacific Coast League championship. He also coached for the 
Mexico City Tigers, and pitched a handful of games there. He was a pitching 
coach with the Cleveland Indians, in the minor leagues for the California 
Angels, and for six years, with Japan's Hiroshima Toyo Carp. For many years 
he owned and ran the large Diamond Star Ranch south of Hartshorne, Oklahoma 
before retiring to live near a golf course in Broken Arrow.[17][18] Spahn 
died of natural causes, at his home in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. He is interred 
in the Elmwood Cemetery in Hartshorne. After his death a street was named 
after him in Buffalo, New York that connects Abbott Road with Seneca Street, 
through Cazenovia Park, in the heart of South Buffalo. The street is near 
South Park High School, Spahn's alma mater. A few months before his death, 
Spahn attended the unveiling of a statue outside Atlanta's Turner Field. 
The statue depicts Spahn in the middle of one of his leg kicks. The statue 
was created by Shan Gray, who has sculpted numerous other statues of athletes 
which stand in Oklahoma, including another one of Spahn that resides in 
the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame. Spahn was selected for the all-time All-Star 
baseball team by Sports Illustrated magazine in 1991, as the left-handed 
pitcher. The other selections were: outfielders Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, and 
Willie Mays; shortstop Cal Ripken, third baseman Mike Schmidt, second baseman 
Jackie Robinson, first baseman Lou Gehrig, catcher Mickey Cochrane, right-handed 
pitcher Christy Mathewson, relief pitcher Dennis Eckersley, and manager 
Casey Stengel. Spahn was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame 
in 1973 and became a charter member of both the Buffalo Baseball Hall of 
Fame in 1985,[19] and the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame in 1991. 
In 1999, editors at The Sporting News ranked Warren Spahn 21st on their 
list of "Baseball's 100 Greatest Players".[20] On April 4, 2009, the facilities 
of Broken Arrow Youth Baseball, in Spahn's longtime home of Broken Arrow, 
Oklahoma, were dedicated in his honor. In their Naked Gun films, producers 
Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker sometimes included joke credits. The trio, 
who were Milwaukee-area natives, included Spahn in the closing credits 
once, with the disclaimer, "He's not in the film, but he's still our all-time 
favorite left-hand pitcher." Spahn also made his acting debut with a cameo 
appearance as a German soldier in a 1963 episode (S2E8 "Glow Against the
