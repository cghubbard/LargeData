Kenneth Dale Holtzman (born November 3, 1945) is a former Major League 
Baseball player, a left-handed starting pitcher who played most of his 
career for the Chicago Cubs and Oakland Athletics. He was a two-time All 
Star and a three-time World Series champion, all while with Oakland. Holtzman 
was the only pitcher in the live-ball era to throw two no-hitters for the 
Cubs, until that feat was equaled by Jake Arrieta. Holtzman was also one 
of the principal pitchers on Oakland's championship teams from 1972 to 
1975. Through 2010, his 174 career victories are the most in the major 
leagues by a Jewish pitcher (ahead of Sandy Koufax). Holtzman's 1,601 strikeouts 
are second (behind Koufax) and his 451 games are second (behind Scott Schoeneweis). 
His 3.49 ERA is fifth (behind Scott Radinsky).[1] He held the record for 
most pitching appearances by a Jewish pitcher until 1998. In 2007 Holtzman 
managed the Petach Tikva Pioneers in the Israel Baseball League. Holtzman 
graduated from University City High School in St. Louis in 1963. He obtained 
his B.A. in business administration from the University of Illinois and 
was selected by the Cubs in the fourth round of the 1965 amateur draft.[2][3] 
At age 19, Holtzman pitched only 12 games in the minor leagues in 1965, 
four with the Treasure Valley Cubs in the Pioneer League, and eight with 
the Wenatchee Chiefs in the Northwest League. He was 8–3 in the dozen starts, 
with a 1.99 earned run average and 114 strikeouts in 86 innings.[4] He 
was called up to the major leagues in September and pitched four innings 
over three games in relief. After three relief appearances in September 
1965, Holtzman joined the Cubs starting rotation in 1966, and had an 11–16 
rookie campaign. The team was in last place that year.[2] The team's fortunes 
turned around, however, as they had winning years in every season from 
1967 through 1971. As a promising Jewish left-hander, he was heralded as 
"the new Sandy Koufax." He pitched against Koufax in 1966 on September 
25, and took the win in a 2–1 score. Koufax made his last regular-season 
appearance a week later, on October 2.[4][5] Holtzman served in the National 
Guard in 1967 and was only available to play on weekends. He appeared in 
12 games and had a 9–0 record.[6] Through 2006, only four pitchers in baseball 
history were undefeated with more decisions. With his military obligations 
behind him, he became a strong second starter behind Ferguson Jenkins, 
and the Cubs began being successful in the National League for the first 
time since World War II. After going 11–14 in 1968, he posted consecutive 
17-win seasons. Holtzman was named NL Player of the Month in May 1969 with 
a 6-0 record, a 2.16 ERA, and 44 strikeouts. That August 19, he pitched 
his first no-hitter at Wrigley Field against the eventual Western Division 
champion Atlanta Braves, winning 3–0 on Ron Santo's 3-run home run and 
outdueling the Braves' Phil Niekro.[7][8] Holtzman had no strikeouts and 
three walks in the game. This was the first no-hitter by a Cub left-hander 
at Wrigley Field[2] and the second no-hitter ever thrown without a strikeout 
(Sad Sam Jones on September 4, 1923),[9] a feat that has not been equaled 
since.[10] In the 7th inning, Hank Aaron hit a drive to center field but 
the wind held up the ball enabling Billy Williams to catch the long fly 
ball at the wall. Holtzman faced Aaron again in the 9th, and got him to 
ground out to complete the no-hitter. The Cubs led the Eastern Division 
for much of the season before finishing in 2nd place, 8 games behind the 
New York Mets. In 1970, Holtzman had his best year with the Cubs, with 
a 17–11 record and a 3.38 ERA, and finished 3rd in the NL in starts (38), 
5th in both strikeouts (202) and innings pitched (287⅔), 6th in complete 
games (15), and 9th in wins. On June 3, 1971, Holtzman pitched a no-hitter—the 
first ever at Riverfront Stadium — against the defending league champion 
Cincinnati Reds, winning the game 1–0 during what would prove to be his 
final year with the Cubs.[11] In doing so, he became the first Cubs pitcher 
since Larry Corcoran (who had three from 1880 to 1884) to have two no-hitters 
for the team. Holtzman asked to be traded at the end of the 1971 season, 
so he was dealt to the Oakland Athletics in November in exchange for outfielder 
Rick Monday.[12] Oakland had won the Western division in 1971 but were 
swept by the Baltimore Orioles in the American League Championship Series. 
This was just as Oakland began its run of three consecutive World Series 
championships.[6] Joining a staff that featured Vida Blue and Catfish Hunter, 
he won 19 games in 1972 (7th in the AL) and was named to the All-Star team 
for the first time.[3] He lost Game 3 of the 1972 American League Championship 
Series against the Detroit Tigers as opposing pitcher Joe Coleman set an 
ALCS record with 14 strikeouts. After Oakland won the ALCS in five games, 
Holtzman won Game 1 of the World Series against the Reds. He started Game 
4, but left in the eighth inning with a 1–0 lead and a runner on third 
base. The Reds scored twice to take the lead, but Oakland scored twice 
in the ninth inning to win 3–2. He relieved Hunter in the eighth inning 
of Game 7 with a 3–1 lead but after surrendering a double to Joe Morgan, 
he was replaced by Rollie Fingers. The A's hung on for a 3–2 win, taking 
their first Series title since 1930 (when the team was located in Philadelphia). 
In 1973, Holtzman led the A's with a 2.97 ERA (6th best in the league) 
as each of their three top starters won 20 or more games. He was again 
an All-Star, going 21–13 in 40 starts (his 21 wins 4th-best in the AL) 
with 157 strikeouts. Over the next 33 years only two other left-handers 
had as many starts in a season. In the 1973 ALCS against the Baltimore 
Orioles, he won an 11-inning 2–1 duel against Mike Cuellar in Game 3 when 
Bert Campaneris homered to lead off the last inning. He started three times 
in the 1973 World Series against the Mets, winning Game 1 by a 2–1 score. 
He lasted only ⅓ of an inning in Game 4, departing after a 3-run homer 
by Rusty Staub, which was followed by two more base runners. He recovered 
to win Game 7, leaving in the 6th inning with a 5–1 lead as the A's took 
the game 5–2 and their second straight title. In both his victories, he 
doubled and also scored the first run for the A's after not having batted 
all season due to the American League using the designated hitter for the 
first time in the 1973 season.[4] Despite posting better or equal numbers 
with Catfish Hunter in 1973, Holtzman was not among the ten AL pitchers 
that year to receive votes in Cy Young Award considerations, while Hunter 
finished third. Holtzman would never earn so much as a single Cy Young 
or MVP vote in his entire career. He again won 19 games in 1974, but this 
time endured 17 losses despite his 3.07 ERA, which ranked 11th in the League. 
Facing the Orioles in the 1974 ALCS, he pitched a 5–0 shutout in Game 2, 
taking a one-hitter into the eighth inning and allowing only five singles. 
Against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series, he started Game 1 
but was pulled in the fifth inning with a 2–1 lead; the A's went on to 
win 3–2. He won Game 4 by a 5–2 score, hitting a home run off Andy Messersmith 
in the third inning for a 1–0 lead (the designated hitter was not used 
in World Series play until 1976). During the nine seasons in which he batted 
regularly during the season, he had only two home runs. Oakland won Game 
5 and became the first team to win three consecutive World Series since 
the New York Yankees won five straight from 1949 to 1953. After losing 
in salary arbitration in February,[13] Holtzman had an 18–14 record for 
the 1975 A's as they won their fifth straight American League Western Division 
title. On June 8, against the Detroit Tigers, he had what would have been 
his third career no-hitter broken up with two out in the ninth by a Tom 
Veryzer double.[14] He would have become the third pitcher (after Cy Young 
and Jim Bunning) to pitch no-hitters in both leagues. Holtzman lost Games 
1 and 3 of the ALCS to the Boston Red Sox as the A's were swept. He was 
fourth in the AL in games started (38), sixth in hits allowed per 9 innings 
pitched (7.33), and seventh in wins. Holtzman was traded to the Orioles, 
along with Reggie Jackson and Bill Van Bommell in April 1976 for Don Baylor, 
Mike Torrez, and Paul Mitchell.[15][16] Eleven weeks later in mid-June, 
he was traded by the Orioles with Doyle Alexander, Jimmy Freeman, Ellie 
Hendricks, and Grant Jackson to the New York Yankees for Rudy May, Tippy 
Martinez, Dave Pagan, Scott McGregor, and Rick Dempsey.[17] Holtzman posted 
a 12–10 record for the Yankees over three years, but his playing time was 
increasingly limited. He did not appear in the 1976 or 1977 postseasons 
with New York. He tied Koufax's record for the most wins by a Jewish pitcher 
in 1977, and passed him in 1978. In 1978 he also passed Larry Sherry's 
record for Jewish pitchers of 416 appearances. In June 1978, after making 
5 appearances, he was traded by the Yankees to the Chicago Cubs for Ron 
Davis. He ended his career with Chicago in 1979, going 6–9 with a 4.59 
ERA. Over 15 years he had a record of 174–150 with a 3.49 ERA, 1,601 strikeouts, 
and 31 shutouts in 451 games and 2,867⅓ innings. He held batters to a .220 
batting average with 2 outs and runners in scoring position. His 80 victories 
with Chicago were the fourth most by a left-hander, behind Hippo Vaughn 
(151), Larry French (95), and Dick Ellsworth (84). He received four votes 
in Baseball Hall of Fame voting in 1985, and 5 in 1986. In 1998, Scott 
Radinsky passed him to become the major league leader in appearances among 
Jewish pitchers. Through 2010 his 174 career victories were the most in 
the major leagues all-time by a Jewish pitcher (ahead of Sandy Koufax), 
his 1,601 strikeouts were second (behind Koufax), his 451 games were second 
(behind Scott Schoeneweis), and his 3.49 ERA was fifth (behind Koufax, 
Radinsky, Barney Pelty, and Erskine Mayer).[1] Holtzman went on to attempt 
a career as an insurance salesman. He also worked for the St. Louis Jewish 
Community Center, running the gymnasium in the Marilyn Fox Building. He 
coached the St. Louis baseball team for the Maccabi games for a few years 
and is a member of the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame. Holtzman managed 
the Petach Tikva Pioneers in the inaugural 2007 season of the Israel Baseball 
League, but was fired before the season ended.[18] The Pioneers finished 
the 2007 regular season in last place (9–32; .220) and lost to the Modi'in 
Miracle in the quarterfinals of the 2007 championship. Ruttman, Larry (2013).
