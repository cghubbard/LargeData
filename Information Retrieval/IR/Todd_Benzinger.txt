Todd Eric Benzinger (born February 11, 1963 in Dayton, Kentucky) is a former 
Major League Baseball first baseman and outfielder who played a nine-year 
MLB career from 1987 to 1995. Benzinger is a graduate of New Richmond High 
School in New Richmond, Ohio. Benzinger started his Major League career 
with the Boston Red Sox in 1987. He would later play for other teams such 
as the Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Dodgers, and the 
San Francisco Giants. Benzinger ended his professional playing career in 
1995 after playing with the Columbus Clippers, then a minor league affiliate 
of the New York Yankees. He played the majority of his career at the first 
baseman position, although he did occasionally play the outfield. As a 
member of the Red Sox, Benzinger is legendary for his clutch hitting during 
the Sox' 1988 "Morgan Magic" run, particularly his 10th inning walk-off 
HR on July 20, 1988. This has been called "The Benzinger Game" by some 
Red Sox enthusiasts.[1] Benzinger ended Orel Hershiser's scoreless streak 
at 59 innings on an RBI hit in the first inning of Hershiser's first start 
of 1989.[2] Benzinger was a member of the 1990 World Series winning Cincinnati 
Reds which saw Cincinnati sweep the much favored Oakland A's in four games. 
Benzinger caught the last out in the 9th inning of Game 4 to give the Reds 
a victory. From 2006 to 2008, Benzinger coached the girls' basketball team 
at Loveland High School in Loveland, Ohio.[3] He managed the Dayton Dragons
