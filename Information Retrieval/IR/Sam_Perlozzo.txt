As player As manager Samuel Benedict Perlozzo (born March 4, 1951 in Cumberland, 
Maryland) is a former second baseman and manager in Major League Baseball, 
most recently with the Baltimore Orioles. After graduating from Bishop 
Walsh School in Cumberland, Perlozzo was drafted by the Twins after playing 
college ball at George Washington University. His professional baseball 
career included parts of two seasons as a reserve with the Minnesota Twins 
and San Diego Padres, along with one season with the Yakult Swallows in 
1980. Going into the last game of the 1977 season Perlozzo's teammate, 
Rod Carew, had 99 RBIs. Perlozzo started the game at shortstop in place 
of Roy Smalley, and just as Perlozzo was about to bat for the first time 
in the game, manager Gene Mauch grabbed him by the arm and said, "I want 
you to go up there and hit a triple, right now, this at-bat. You hit a 
triple, understand?" Perlozzo did hit a triple, and Carew hit a single 
to gain his 100th RBI of the season.[1] With the Orioles, he was promoted 
from bench coach to interim manager after manager Lee Mazzilli was fired 
on August 4, 2005, during the team's worst losing streak of the season. 
The Orioles went 23–32 under Perlozzo that season. On October 12, the "interim" 
title was dropped as Perlozzo was named the team's manager. In 2006, Perlozzo's 
first full season as manager of the Orioles, the team finished with a 70–92 
record. Orioles owner Peter Angelos fired Perlozzo as the team's manager 
on June 18, 2007.[2] Perlozzo was replaced by Bullpen coach Dave Trembley 
on an interim basis then, after some success, had the interim tag removed. 
On November 5, 2007 the Seattle Mariners announced that Perlozzo had been 
hired as their third base coach. In 2009, he was hired as 3rd base coach 
by the Philadelphia Phillies. He was moved to 1st base coach for the 2011 
season after another former O's manager Juan Samuel joined the Phillies
