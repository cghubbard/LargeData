As Player As Manager James Thomas "Deacon" McGuire (November 18, 1863 – 
October 31, 1936) was an American professional baseball player, manager 
and coach whose career spanned the years 1883 to 1915. He played 26 seasons 
in Major League Baseball, principally as a catcher, for 11 different major 
league clubs. His longest stretches were with the Washington Statesmen/Senators 
(901 games, 1892–99), Brooklyn Superbas (202 games, 1899–1901) and New 
York Highlanders (225 games, 1904–07). He played on Brooklyn teams that 
won National League pennants in 1899 and 1900. McGuire was the most durable 
catcher of his era, setting major league catching records for most career 
games caught (1,612), putouts (6,856), assists (1,860), double plays turned 
(143), runners caught stealing (1,459), and stolen bases allowed (2,529). 
His assist, caught stealing, and stolen bases allowed totals remain current 
major league records. During his major league career, he also compiled 
a .278 batting average, .341 on-base percentage, 770 runs scored, 1,750 
hits, 300 doubles, 79 triples, 45 home runs, 840 RBIs and 118 stolen bases. 
His best season was 1895 when he caught a major league record 133 games 
and compiled a .336 batting average with 10 home runs, 97 RBIs and 17 stolen 
bases.[1] McGuire was also the manager of the Washington Senators (1898), 
Boston Red Sox (1907–08) and Cleveland Indians (1909–11). He compiled a 
210–287 (.423) as a major league manager.[2] McGuire was born in Youngstown, 
Ohio, in 1863.[1] He moved as a boy to Cleveland, learned to play baseball 
"on the lots" of that city, and at age 18 was playing for the "Woodlands" 
team.[3] As a young man, he moved to Albion, Michigan, where he worked 
as an apprentice in an iron foundry in Albion and played baseball on the 
weekend.[4] McGuire first gained note playing baseball for a team in Hastings, 
Michigan, where he was paired with pitcher Lady Baldwin. McGuire was reputed 
to be "the only catcher within a 50-mile radius who could handle" the left-handed 
Baldwin and his "incendiary fastball and sinuous curve, a so-called 'snakeball.'"[4][5] 
At age 19, McGuire began his professional baseball career in 1883 with 
the Terre Haute, Indiana, club.[3][6] McGuire made his major league debut 
in June 1884 with the Toledo Blue Stockings of the American Association. 
He hit .185 in 151 at bats and appeared in 45 games.[1] At Toledo, he shared 
the catching responsibilities with Moses Fleetwood Walker, the first African-American 
player in Major League Baseball.[4] McGuire and Walker each caught 41 games 
for the Blue Stockings.[1][7] The Blue Stockings finished in eighth place 
(out of 13 teams) with a 46–58 record and folded after the 1884 season.[8] 
McGuire began the 1885 season playing for the Indianapolis Hoosiers of 
the newly formed Western League. McGuire appeared in 16 games for the Hoosiers, 
who were the dominant team in the Western League, compiling an .880 winning 
percentage.[9] In mid June 1885, the Western League disbanded, and a mad 
rush developed to sign the players on the Indianapolis roster,[9] a line-up 
that included McGuire, Sam Thompson, Sam Crane, Chub Collins, Jim Donnelly, 
Mox McQuery, Gene Moriarty, and Dan Casey. Sam Thompson later told the 
colorful story of the Detroit Wolverines' acquisition of the Indianapolis 
players. Detroit sent two representatives (Marsh and Maloney) to Indianapolis, 
principally to sign the Hoosiers' battery of Larry McKeon and Jim Keenan. 
The Wolverines were outbid by the Cincinnati Reds for McKeon and Keenan 
but wound up with the Hoosiers' manager (Bill Watkins) and the rest of 
the team's starting lineup. The only catch was that a 10-day waiting period 
would allow other teams to outbid Detroit. Marsh and Maloney promptly sent 
the players to Detroit and quartered them in a hotel there. The next morning, 
the players were told that the team had arranged a fishing trip for them. 
The players boarded the steamship Annette and enjoyed the first day and 
night of successful fishing. After three days, the players became suspicious, 
but the ship captain laughed when asked when they would return to Detroit. 
As the players became mutinous on the sixth day, the captain admitted he 
had been ordered to keep them "out at sea" for 10 days.[9] In another account, 
Thompson described his 10 days aboard the Annette as follows: "We were 
prisoners, but well cared-for prisoners. Anything in the line of creature 
comforts you could find packed away on ice. We lived on the best in the 
market, and spent the rest of the time in fishing and playing poker, chips 
having very thoughtfully been provided. On the night of the tenth day, 
at midnight, we were all taken ashore where Watkins met us and signed us 
to our contracts."[10] The players were only later presented with their 
accumulated mail which included scores of offers from other clubs.[9] A 
writer in the Detroit Free Press later noted: "Detroit magnates showed 
some inside baseball brains and great finessing in sending the players 
away from all tempters for that period when they belonged to no club."[9] 
Once at Detroit, McGuire hit .190 in 121 at bats and served as the backup 
for catcher Charlie Bennett; Bennett caught 62 games and McGuire 31.[1][11] 
While with the Wolverines, McGuire was reunited with Lady Baldwin, the 
"snakeball" pitcher who he had caught in Hastings. Despite the infusion 
of talent from Indianapolis, the Wolverines finished in sixth place with 
a 41–67 record.[12] In November 1885, the Wolverines returned McGuire to 
league control, and he was then acquired by the Philadelphia Quakers in 
January 1886. McGuire played with the Quakers for two full seasons.[1] 
In 1886, McGuire caught 49 games for the Quakers,[1] two more than the 
team's other principal catcher Jack Clements.[13] The 1886 season was McGuire's 
first in the major leagues with a winning ball club, as the Quakers finished 
in fourth place in the National League with a 71–43 record.[14] In 1887, 
McGuire and Clements again split the catching duties for the Quakers, with 
41 and 59 games, respectively.[1][13] McGuire improved dramatically as 
a batter in 1887. After compiling a .198 batting average in 1886, McGuire 
hit .307 in 150 at bats.[1] The team also improved to second place with 
a 75–48 record.[15] McGuire began the 1888 season with the Quakers. However, 
on June 30, 1888, he was released by the Quakers after batting .333 in 
12 games and 51 at bats.[1] On July 2, 1888, McGuire signed as a free agent 
with the Detroit Wolverines. He appeared in only three games for Detroit, 
had no hits in 13 at bats, and was released on August 1, 1888.[1] In late 
August 1888, McGuire met and signed with Tom Loftus, the manager of the 
Cleveland Blues of the National League. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported 
at the time: "He will strengthen the team a good deal, especially in batting. 
Jim was a little careless as to his condition early in the season and Harry 
Wright released him because he had three other cheaper catchers. . . . 
At this time he is in perfect condition and has given a fine sample of 
his work in the three games against Kansas City."[16] McGuire appeared 
in 26 games for Cleveland at the end of the 1888 season, batting .255 in 
94 at bats.[1] In early February 1889, McGuire was released by Cleveland 
and signed by the Toronto Canucks of the International League.[17] McGuire 
appeared in 93 games for Toronto and hit .282 with 72 runs scored, 42 extra 
base hits and 29 stolen bases.[18] (An account published at the end of 
the 1889 season stated that McGuire hit .300 at Toronto and caught 92 games.[19]) 
In February 1890, the Rochester Broncos of the American Association purchased 
McGuire from Toronto. In his return to the major leagues, McGuire appeared 
in 87 games for Rochester, 71 as a catcher, 15 at first base, three in 
the outfield and one as a pitcher. He hit .299 with a .356 on-base percentage, 
.408 slugging average and 53 RBIs. Prior to the 1890 season, McGuire had 
never earned a Wins Above Replacement (WAR) rating even as high as 1.0; 
his 1890 season received a 2.7 WAR rating. His defensive play also blossomed 
in 1890 with a 0.9 Defensive WAR rating – the only season in McGuire's 
long career in which he ranked among the top ten Defensive WAR ratings 
in his league.[1] In The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, sports 
historian Bill James wrote that McGuire was called Deacon, "because he 
didn't drink and carouse", like other players of his era.[20] To the contrary, 
a biographical sketch of McGuire published in 1901 stated that McGuire 
had been a heavy drinker for much of his career, though he did later become 
a "teetotaler."[5] The sketch noted: "McGuire's career, as will be noted, 
has been a somewhat checkered one and not without its ups and downs. His 
downs, for the most part, were due to an acquaintance he early formed with 
the Hon. John Barleycorn, and his association with this noted gentleman 
led to frequent and divers bouts with one Ben Booze who invariably gave 
Mac the worst of it and came near causing his downfall. It was not until 
he quit these gentlemen entirely that the true worth of the man permanently 
asserted itself and his flight into fame was continued."[5] Another account, 
published in Sports Illustrated 1984, stated that McGuire's Brooklyn teammates 
gave him the nickname in 1900 because he was "so straight-arrow" and had 
never been fined or ejected from a game.[4] Multiple accounts support the 
widely-publicized claim that he was never fined or ejected from a game 
and describe McGuire as "placid, easy-going, hard-working and thoroughly 
conscientious."[21][22][23] However, the origin of the "Deacon" nickname 
appears to date back to 1896. In February of that year, The Sporting Life, 
a national baseball newspaper, reported a dispatch from Michigan that McGuire 
"has experienced religion at a revival meeting and is thinking of giving 
up base ball and devote his time to preaching, perhaps."[24] The Sporting 
Life closed with this observation: " If Mac felt bent on doing missionary 
work his duty is to remain right where he is. But he will be back next 
April doing just as brilliant work behind the bat as last year. He will 
have no redress, however, if he is addressed hereafter as 'Deacon' McGuire."[24] 
In February 1891, McGuire jumped from the Rochester Broncos to the Washington 
Statesmen. He played the next nine seasons in a Washington uniform.[1] 
During the 1891 season, McGuire appeared in 114 games for the Statesmen, 
including 98 as a catcher and 18 in the outfield. He compiled a .303 batting 
average and, with the boost from 43 bases on balls and 10 times hit by 
pitch, a .382 on-base percentage. For the second consecutive season, he 
earned a 2.7 WAR rating – a level he would exceed only once in his career. 
Focusing solely on offense, his Offensive WAR rating in 1891 was 3.3 – 
the only time he ranked among the top ten Offensive WAR ratings in his 
league. Defensively, McGuire led the American Association's catchers with 
130 assists, 56 errors, 204 stolen bases allowed and 129 runners caught 
stealing.[1] Despite McGuire's efforts, the Statesmen finished the 1891 
season in last place in the American Association with a 44–91 record.[25] 
In 1892, the Statesmen were admitted to the National League and renamed 
the Senators. The Senators finished the season in 10th place (out of 12 
teams) with a 58–93 record.[26] McGuire's batting average, ever erratic, 
dropped 71 points from the prior year to .232. However, McGuire had almost 
as many bases on balls (61) as hits (73), giving him a more than respectable 
.360 on-base percentage. Factoring in all of his contributions, McGuire 
received a 2.4 WAR rating for 1892.[1] In 1893, McGuire caught only 50 
games and, despite the limited playing time, ranked second in the National 
League's catchers with 27 errors. The 1893 season also generated McGuire's 
worst WAR rating (0.4) of the decade.[1] The Senators as a team also suffered 
in 1893, finishing in 12th (last) place with a 40–89 record.[27] The Senators 
rebounded only slightly in 1894, finishing in 11th place with a 45–87 record.[28] 
McGuire, on the other hand, improved markedly. His batting average jumped 
49 points to .306, and his WAR rating increased to 1.5. Defensively, he 
led the league with 278 stolen bases allowed and finished second among 
the league's catchers with 114 assists, 127 runners caught stealing, 36 
errors and 27 passed balls.[1] McGuire had the best season of his career 
in 1895 as he hit .336 with 48 extra bases hits (including 10 home runs), 
97 RBIs and 17 stolen bases. His WAR rating of 4.0 was, by far, the highest 
of his career. Defensively, he set a new major league record by catching 
all 133 games. The Sporting News in October 1895 called McGuire's 133 games 
the "record of records": Catcher Jim McGuire's correct record of League 
games caught in this season is 133, 128 of which appear in the standing 
of the club, four were tie games and one the postponed Boston game. He 
is to-day in excellent condition. This is the record of records in the 
league, and many a year will roll by before it is equaled."[29] He also 
led the National League's catchers with 312 putouts, 180 assists, 40 errors, 
12 double plays turned, 28 passed balls, 293 stolen bases allowed, and 
189 runners caught stealing.[1] Even with McGuire having his best season, 
the Senators continued to wallow near the bottom of the National League, 
finishing the 1895 season in 10th place with a 43–85 record.[30] In 1896, 
McGuire had another good season, and the Senators again finished near the 
bottom of the standings, in ninth place with a 58–73 record.[31] McGuire 
hit .321, earning a 2.4 WAR rating. Defensively, he led the league's catchers 
in multiple categories for the second consecutive year, totaling 98 games 
at catcher (1st), 349 putouts (1st), 87 assists (2nd), 30 errors (1st), 
14 double plays (1st), 205 stolen bases allowed (1st), and 97 runners caught 
stealing (2nd).[1] The 1897 season was one of modest improvement for the 
Senators, finishing in sixth place with a 61–71 record.[32] McGuire appeared 
in fewer games, 73 at catcher and six at first base, compiled a .343 batting 
average (the highest of his career), and earned a 2.5 WAR rating.[1] In 
1898, the Senators' improvement dissipated, as they finished in 11th place 
with a 51–101 record.[33] McGuire appeared in 131 games for the Senators, 
93 at catcher and 37 at first base. His batting average dropped by 75 points 
under the prior year to .268 with a WAR rating of 1.6.[1] McGuire was also 
asked to serve as player-manager during the latter half of the 1898 season, 
compiling a record of 19–49 in the final 68 games of the season.[2] By 
1899, McGuire was 35 years old and the ninth oldest player in the National 
League. He began the year for the ninth consecutive season with an overmatched 
Washington team that finished in 11th place. During the first half of the 
season, McGuire's performance ebbed, earning a 0.8 WAR rating.[1] On July 
14, 1899, McGuire received good news; he had been traded to the Brooklyn 
Superbas,[1] a team managed by Ned Hanlon and competing for the National 
League pennant. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle praised the trade: "McGuire has 
always been looked upon as one of the best catchers in the league . . . 
he has no superior as a coacher of pitchers and for steady and uninterrupted 
work."[4] The Washington correspondent for the Sporting Life wrote that 
the trade "marked the passing of the most consistent and reliable player 
that ever wore a Washington uniform" and called McGuire "the backbone of 
the Washington team."[34] Playing for a winning ball club for the first 
time in a decade, McGuire caught 46 games and blossomed. His batting average 
bounced back to .318 with a .385 on-base percentage, .446 slugging average 
and 1.4 WAR rating.[1] The team finished strong with the addition of McGuire, 
compiling a 39–14 record after August 12 and winning the National League 
pennant by eight games.[35] In 1900, McGuire shared catching responsibility 
with Duke Farrell, McGuire handling 69 games at the position and Farrell 
76. McGuire compiled a .286 batting average, .348 on-base percentage and 
1.2 WAR rating. His performance helped the Superbas win their second consecutive 
pennant with a 82–54 record.[36] During one game in 1900, McGuire threw 
out seven runners attempting to steal second base, caught another "asleep 
on second and nipped still another slumbering off third."[5] McGuire resumed 
his role as the Superbas' number one catcher in 1901. He caught 81 games 
and compiled a .296 batting average, .342 on-base percentage and 1.6 WAR 
rating.[1] The Superbas remained competitive, finishing in third place 
with a 79–57 record.[36] In March 1902, McGuire jumped to the still new 
American League, signing a two-year with the Detroit Tigers. The Brooklyn 
club sued McGuire for breaching his contract to play there and sought an 
injunction prohibiting him from playing anywhere else.[37][38][39] The 
case went to trial in June 1902 in Philadelphia federal court. Brooklyn 
club president Charles Ebbets testified in court "to the extraordinary 
qualities of McGuire as a catcher."[40] McGuire argued that his contract 
with Brooklyn was invalid on the ground that the "reserve clause" was a 
violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.[41] After hearing the evidence, 
Judge George M. Dallas ruled in favor of McGuire, holding that the Brooklyn 
contract was unenforceable due to a lack of mutuality, and because Brooklyn 
had failed to prove that McGuire's services were unique and irreplaceable.[42] 
Judge Dallas' opinion, in part, stated: "The contract upon which this suit 
is founded provides that the party of the first part (the plaintiff) may 
end and determine all its liabilities and obligations thereunder upon giving 
the party of the second part (the defendant) ten days' notice of its option 
and intention to do so, and in Marble Company vs. Itipley, 10 Wall. 339, 
it was distinctly held that a contract which the plaintiff may abandon 
at any time on giving one year's notice is not enforceable in equity.... 
In short, I am of opinion that the decision in Marble Company against Ripley 
is binding upon this Court and is determinative of the present motion. 
A preliminary injunction should not be awarded in any case where the proofs 
leave the mind of the Court in serious doubt respecting the plaintiff's 
asserted right, and the testimony and affidavits submitted for and against 
the present application do not establish with reasonable certainty that 
the breach of contract of which the plaintiff complains could not be adequately 
compensated at law. The evidence adduced is by no means conclusive upon 
the question whether the services which the defendant contracted to render 
were so unique and peculiar that they could not be performed and substantially 
as well by others engaged in professional ball playing, who might be easily 
be obtained to take his place. The motion for a preliminary injunction 
is denied."[42] The Brooklyn correspondent for The Sporting News wrote 
that the court's decision did not change the fact that "McGuire played 
the Brooklyn management a low and cowardly trick", suggested that the team 
sue McGuire for damages, and opined that the Brooklyn public did not care 
"two cents whether McGuire never comes back."[43] In 1914, the McGuire 
case became a significant precedent that was relied upon by players and 
Federal League officials when that league sought to entice players to its 
ranks.[41][44] With the legal proceedings at an end, McGuire shared catching 
responsibility in Detroit with Fritz Buelow, McGuire catching 70 games 
in 1902 and Buelow 63.[1] The Tigers' management valued McGuire not only 
for his playing ability, but also because his coaching "was figured on 
to aid greatly in developing the young material" that the Tigers were bringing 
together.[45] At age 38, McGuire was the fourth oldest player in the American 
League, his batting average dropped to .227 – his lowest level since 1886 
---, and his WAR rating fell to 0.7.[1] The Tigers finished in seventh 
place with a 52–83 record.[46] In February 1903, Ned Hanlon, manager of 
the Brooklyn club, claimed that Brooklyn still had the reserve rights to 
McGuire and challenged his contract with Detroit.[45] Hanlon did not issue 
the threatened order to report for several weeks,[47] then did so in April 
1903.[48] In the end, a deal was struck pursuant to which Brooklyn released 
any claim it had over McGuire.[49] During the 1903 season, McGuire again 
shared catching duties with Buelow – 69 games for McGuire and 63 for Buelow. 
McGuire hit .250 and earned a 1.2 WAR rating.[1] The Tigers finished in 
fifth place with a 65–71 record.[50] In February 1904, Detroit sold McGuire 
to the New York Highlanders. He spent his final years as a full-time player 
with the Highlanders from 1904 to 1906. In 1904, at age 40, McGuire caught 
97 games, his highest tally since 1899. He led the American League's catchers 
with 11 double plays turned and ranked second in the league with 530 putouts 
and 120 assists. His batting average fell to .208,[1] but with Willie Keeler 
batting .343 and Jack Chesbro winning 41 games, the Highlanders compiled 
a 92–59 and finished one-and-a-half games behind Boston for the American 
League pennant.[51] In 1905, McGuire remained New York's number one catcher, 
appearing in 71 games at the position. He hit .219 and earned a 0.7 WAR 
rating. By 1906, McGuire, at age 42, was the second oldest player in the 
league. In his last season as a full-time player, he caught 51 games and 
hit .299 in 144 at bats.[1] McGuire was hired by the Boston Red Sox in 
early June 1906 and took over as the team's manager on June 10, 1907.[52] 
He compiled a 45–61 (.425) record as manager in 1907 and returned in 1908, 
compiling a 53–62 (.461) record.[2] McGuire also appeared in seven games 
as a player for Boston, principally as a pinch-hitter, and made three hits, 
including a home run, and scored a run in five plate appearances. He was 
released by the Red Sox on August 28, 1908.[1] Although McGuire's Boston 
teams did not achieve a winning record, his teams lacked batting strength. 
He had Cy Young as a pitcher, but his 1907 team finished with the lowest 
batting average (.234) in the American League.[53] McGuire was credited 
with having "whipped the bunch of veterans and kids from tailenders into 
a fighting machine, laying the foundation for the whirlwind team" that 
went 88–63 in 1909.[3] On September 18, 1908, McGuire signed as a free 
agent with the Cleveland Naps and appeared in only game at first base.[1] 
McGuire served principally as a scout for Cleveland in 1908 and the first 
half of 1909. On August 21, 1909, he was hired as Cleveland's manager, 
replacing Nap Lajoie.[54] Club officials at the time opined that McGuire 
"possesses the necessary ginger to bring about a different style of playing."[3] 
McGuire led the team to a 14–25 (.359) record during the last weeks of 
the 1909 season. He returned in 1910 and led the team to a 71–81 (.467) 
record. In 1911, McGuire compiled a 6–11 (.353) record as Cleveland's manager.[2] 
On May 3, 1911, he resigned as manager and was replaced by George Stovall. 
In resigning his post, McGuire stated that he was disappointed in the team's 
showing and hoped that better results could be achieved with a new man 
in charge.[55] In February 1912, McGuire was hired as a pitching coach 
for the Detroit Tigers.[56] He had been expected to serve as a scout during 
the regular season, but was assigned in May 1912 to remain with the club 
as a coach throughout the season, working alongside manager Hughie Jennings. 
The Sporting Life wrote: "With McGuire and Jennings on the coaching lines 
the Tigers would be better fortified in this department than any team in 
the league."[57] In May 1912, when the Detroit players refused to play 
in protest over the suspension of Ty Cobb for attacking a fan, the club's 
management was forced to come up with a substitute team for a game in Philadelphia. 
McGuire took to the field as one of the Tigers' replacement players. He 
had a hit and scored a run in his final major league game, but the Tigers 
lost the game by a 24–2 score.[58] In January 1914, McGuire was assigned 
to coach Detroit's young pitchers during spring training with the understanding 
that he would then leave the club to assume "his regular duties as chief 
of scouts."[59] In 1915, he returned to the Tigers as a scout.[60] In January 
1916, Detroit president Frank Navin released McGuire from the position 
he had held with the club as a scout and coach. McGuire stated at the time 
that he expected "to devote all his attention to his business In Albion, 
Mich."[61] (Some accounts indicate that he continued to scout for the Tigers 
until 1926.[4][6]) In 1936, H. G. Salsinger wrote an article that was published 
in The Sporting News crediting McGuire as the "first catcher to pad a glove."[58] 
Salsinger wrote that McGuire "resorted to a primordial method" by stuffing 
his glove with a piece of raw steak to absorb the shock. Salsinger wrote 
that manufacturers took a hint from McGuire and began padding catcher's 
mitts with felt and hair. Salsinger opined that modern catchers "should 
erect a monument" to repay the debt owed to McGuire's innovation.[58] McGuire 
claimed he came up with the idea when he was catching for pitcher Hank 
O'Day at Toledo in 1884. McGuire said that O'Day "threw the heaviest and 
hardest ball I ever caught", and that O'Day's pitches "came like a shell 
from a cannon."[4] McGuire recalled: "The reinforced full-fingered catcher's 
glove had just come into use the year before. One day on my way to that 
old Toledo park on Monroe Street, I passed a butcher pounding round steak. 
It gave me an idea, and I went in and bought a lot of it. I put a piece 
of it in my glove at the start of every inning, and Hank's pitches beat 
that steak into a pulp."[4] McGuire's wife recalled her husband using "a 
piece of beefsteak" and noted: "At game's end it would be hamburger."[62] 
McGuire played before the advent of most modern protective equipment, and 
his fingers were reportedly "gnarled, broken, bent, split and crooked" 
by the end of his career.[62] One account, published in 1901, emphasized 
the physical beating: "A picture of McGuire's hands would be an interesting 
and wonderful exhibit. The maimed and misshapen members which he will carry 
with him after he quits the game and to the grave are mute reminders of 
many a foul ticked off the bat, a wild thrown ball stopped with the finger 
tips after a leap into the air, or a low one clawed up out of the roots 
of the plate, and an occasional one caught full on the end of a digit, 
splitting the flesh and nail."[5] In 1904, former teammate Sam Crane called 
McGuire "a wonder – physically and mentally" and "a human octopus."[21] 
Crane also described McGuire's hands: "His big, brawny, strong hands, now 
grotesquely disfigured by the continuous battering they have received from 
the viciously wicked inshoots, curves, slants and benders of the speediest 
pitchers known in the long history of the game, have acted as an unflinchable 
barrier to the accumulation of momentum that if concentrated would have 
an irresistible force capable of crushing a battleship or of pulverizing 
a backstop construction of Harveyized steel armor plate."[21] In 1907, 
newspapers across the country published an x-ray of McGuire's left hand 
(pictured, above at right), showing "36 breaks, twists or bumps all due 
to baseball accidents."[63] The text accompanying the widely published 
photograph noted: "When the picture was developed the photographer was 
amazed to see the knots, like gnarled places on an old oak tree, around 
the joints, and numerous spots showing old breaks. In several joints the 
bones are flattened and pushed to the side."[63][64] Despite the injuries 
and physical demands of a catcher's duties, McGuire showed remarkable longevity. 
In 26 years in the major leagues, McGuire compiled a .278 career batting 
average, .341 on-base percentage and .372 slugging percentage. He appeared 
in 1,781 games and totaled 770 runs scored, 1,750 hits, 300 doubles, 79 
triples, 45 home runs, 840 RBIs, 118 stolen bases and 515 bases on balls.[1] 
McGuire's longevity enabled him to set numerous major league records, some 
of which are set forth below: In The New Bill James Historical Baseball 
Abstract, sports historian Bill James ranked McGuire as the 40th best catcher 
of all time. The only 19th century catcher ranked higher than McGuire was 
Buck Ewing, whom James ranked 17th.[20] McGuire was married in 1893 to 
May K. Huxford.[62][72] They had no children.[65][72][73][74] Even before 
retiring from baseball, McGuire made his home in Albion, Michigan, and 
had developed other business interests there. By 1901, McGuire and his 
brother owned a "well paying wet goods emporium" and an ice business in 
Albion.[5] The "wet goods emporium" appears to refer to a saloon in Albion 
known as "McGuire Brothers", originally located at 204 S. Superior St., 
which moved in 1912 to 103 West Porter Street. McGuire worked in the saloon 
during the off-season, and his brother (George) operated it year round.[75][76] 
In 1915, Albion "went dry", and McGuire Brothers became a restaurant and 
"sample room" and eventually closed.[76] In 1906, McGuire and his wife 
also purchased a flour mill on the Kalamazoo River near Albion.[77] In 
1914, a man who was believed to have gone insane twice attempted to kill 
McGuire. The first attempt was at McGuire's cabin in Duck Lake, Michigan, 
using both an axe and a revolver. The second attempt was at McGuire's home 
in Albion, using a repeating rifle. McGuire was reported to have narrowly 
escaped death.[78] After retiring from baseball, McGuire returned to his 
home in Albion. He coached the Albion College baseball team in 1926 and 
worked as a chicken farmer.[6][74] McGuire died in 1936 at age 72. The 
cause of death was pneumonia that developed after suffering a stroke at 
his chicken ranch in Duck Lake, Michigan.[6] He was buried at Riverside
