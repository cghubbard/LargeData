The 1989 Chicago White Sox season was the White Sox's 90th season. They 
finished with a record 69-92, good enough for 7th place in the American 
League West, 29.5 games behind of the 1st place Oakland Athletics. In July 
1988, legislators from the State of Illinois narrowly approved a proposal 
for a new state-financed stadium and a lease deal that would save the team 
$60 million and kept the White Sox from moving to St. Petersburg, Florida.[1] 
St. Petersburg has begun construction on an $80 million domed stadium.[1] 
The club's principal owners, Jerry Reinsdorf and Eddie Einhorn, had said 
the team would move to St. Petersburg, Florida, for the 1989 season if 
the stadium proposal were not approved.[1] The State Senate in Springfield 
passed the stadium bill by a 30-26 vote about 20 minutes before midnight, 
then sent it on to the General Assembly, where Gov. James Thompson was 
involved in political maneuvering on the last day the Legislature was in 
session.[1] The money for the ball park, would come from a 2 percent city 
hotel-motel tax, estimated to be worth at least $8 million a year. The 
city would add $5 million annually in revenue-sharing funds, and the state 
would contribute $5 million in hotel-motel tax revenues.[1] [1] [2] [3]
