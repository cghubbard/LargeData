The Baltimore Orioles (nicknamed The O's and The Birds) are a Major League 
Baseball team based in Baltimore, Maryland. They are in the Eastern Division 
of the American League. They are owned by attorney Peter Angelos. The modern 
Orioles franchise can trace its roots back to the original Milwaukee Brewers 
of the minor Western League, beginning in 1894 when the league reorganized. 
The Brewers were there when the WL renamed itself the American League in 
1900. At the end of the 1900 season, the American League removed itself 
from baseball's National Agreement (the formal understanding between the 
NL and the minor leagues). Two months later, the AL declared itself a competing 
major league. As a result of several franchise shifts, the Brewers were 
one of only two Western League teams that didn't either fold or move (the 
other being the Detroit Tigers). During the first American League season, 
they finished dead last with a record of 48-89. During its lone Major League 
season, the team played at Lloyd Street Grounds, between 16th and 18th 
Streets in Milwaukee. As the baseball "war" heated up the American League 
began to challenge the senior circuit more directly. The American League 
already fielded teams in Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia, solid National 
League cities. It had planned to move the Brewers to St. Louis, but those 
plans fizzled. In 1902, however, the team did move to St. Louis, where 
it became the "Browns", in reference to the original name of the legendary 
1880s club that by 1902 was known as the Cardinals. In their first St. 
Louis season, the Browns finished second. Although they usually fielded 
terrible or mediocre teams (they had only four winning seasons from 1901 
to 1922), they were very popular at the gate. During this time, the Browns 
were best known for their role in the race for the 1910 American League 
batting title. Detroit's Ty Cobb took the last game of the season off, 
believing that his slight lead over Cleveland's Nap Lajoie would hold up 
unless Lajoie had a near-perfect day at the plate. However, Cobb was one 
of the most despised players in baseball, and Browns catcher-manager Jack 
O'Connor ordered rookie third baseman Red Corriden to station himself in 
shallow left field. In each of his next five at bats, Lajoie bunted down 
the third-base line and made it to first easily. In his last at-bat, he 
reached base on an error – officially giving him a hitless at-bat. O'Connor 
and coach Harry Howell tried to bribe the official scorer, a woman, to 
change the call to a hit, even offering to buy her a new wardrobe. Cobb 
won the batting title by just a few thousandths of a point over Lajoie 
(though in 1978 sabermetrician Pete Palmer discovered that one game may 
have been counted twice in the statistics). The resulting outcry triggered 
an investigation by American League president Ban Johnson. At his insistence, 
Browns owner Robert Hedges fired O'Connor and Howell; both men were informally 
banned from baseball for life. In 1916, after years of prosperity at the 
gate, Hedges sold the team to cold-storage magnate Phil Ball, who had owned 
the St. Louis Terriers of the defunct Federal League. Ball's tenure as 
owner saw the Browns' first period of prosperity; they were a contender 
for most of the early 1920s, even finishing second in 1922. He made a considerable 
effort to make the Browns competitive, reinvesting all profits back into 
the team. Ball, however, committed several errors that dogged the franchise 
for years to come. His first major blunder was to fire Branch Rickey, the 
resident genius in the Browns' front office, in 1919 because of a conflict 
of egos, causing Rickey to jump to the crosstown Cardinals. In 1920 Sam 
Breadon, who had just purchased the Cardinals, convinced Ball to allow 
his team to share the Browns' home, Sportsman's Park. With the money from 
the sale of the Cardinals' Robison Field, Rickey began building an extensive 
farm system. This eventually produced a host of star players that brought 
the Cardinals far more drawing power than the Browns. The 1922 Browns excited 
their owner by almost beating the Yankees to a pennant. The club was boasting 
the best players in franchise history, including George Sisler, and an 
outfield trio – Ken Williams, Baby Doll Jacobson, and Jack Tobin – that 
batted .300 or better in 1919–23 and in 1925. In 1922, Williams became 
the first player in Major League history to hit 30 home runs and steal 
30 bases in a season, something that would not be done again in the Majors 
until 1956. Ball confidently predicted that there would be a World Series 
in Sportsman's Park by 1926. In anticipation, he increased the capacity 
of his ballpark from 18,000 to 30,000. There was indeed a World Series 
in Sportsman's Park in 1926, but it was the Cardinals, not the Browns, 
who took part, upsetting the Yankees. St. Louis had been considered a "Browns' 
town" until then; after 1926, the Cardinals dominated St. Louis baseball, 
while still technically tenants of the Browns. Meanwhile, the Browns rapidly 
fell into the cellar. They only had two winning records from 1927 to 1943, 
including a 43-111 mark in 1939 that is still the worst in franchise history. 
Ball died in 1933. His estate ran the team for three years until Rickey 
helped broker a sale to investment banker Donald Lee Barnes, whose son-in-law, 
Bill DeWitt, was the team's general manager. To help finance the purchase, 
Barnes sold 20,000 shares of stock to the public at $5 a share, an unusual 
practice for a sports franchise. In 1944, during World War II, the Browns 
won their only St. Louis-based American League pennant, becoming the last 
of the 16 teams that made up the major leagues from 1901 to 1960 to play 
in a World Series. By comparison, each of the other seven American League 
teams had appeared in at least three World Series, and won it at least 
once. Some critics called it a fluke, as most major league stars voluntarily 
joined or were drafted into the military; however, many of the Browns' 
best players were classified 4-F (unfit for military service). They faced 
their local rivals, the more successful Cardinals, in the 1944 World Series, 
the last World Series to date played entirely in one stadium, and lost 
4 games to 2. After the season, Barnes sold the Browns to businessman Richard 
Muckerman, who cared more about improving Sportsman's Park than getting 
better players. In 1945, the Browns posted an 81-75 record and fell to 
third place, six games out, again with less than top-ranked talent. The 
1945 season may be best remembered for the Browns' signing of utility outfielder 
Pete Gray, the only one-armed major league position player in history. 
They tumbled to seventh in 1946. They would never finish with a winning 
record again while in St. Louis, partly because Muckerman cared more about 
improving Sportsman's Park rather than getting better players. Muckerman 
sold the team to DeWitt in 1949, but DeWitt was unable to reverse the slide. 
In 1951, Bill Veeck, the colorful former owner of the Cleveland Indians, 
purchased the Browns. In St. Louis, he extended the promotions and wild 
antics that had made him famous and loved by many and loathed by many others. 
His most notorious stunt in St. Louis came on August 19, 1951, when he 
instructed Browns manager, Zack Taylor to send Eddie Gaedel, a 3-foot 7 inch, 
65-pound midget, to bat as a pinch hitter.[1] When Gaedel stepped to the 
plate he was wearing a Browns uniform with the number 1/8, and little slippers 
turned up at the end like elf's shoes. With no strike zone to speak of, 
Gaedel walked on four straight pitches. The stunt infuriated American League 
President Will Harridge, who voided Gaedel's contract the next day. In 
another Veeck stunt, the Browns handed out placards – reading take, swing, 
bunt, etc. – to fans and allowed them to make managerial decisions for 
a day. Taylor dutifully surveyed the fans' advice and relayed the sign 
accordingly.[2] Veeck also brought the legendary, and seemingly ageless, 
Satchel Paige back to major league baseball to pitch for the Browns. Veeck 
had previously signed the former Negro League great to a contract in Cleveland 
in 1948 at age 42, amid much criticism. At 45, Paige's re-appearance in 
a Browns' uniform did nothing to win Veeck friends among baseball's owners. 
Nonetheless, Paige ended the season with a respectable 3-4 record and a 
4.79 ERA. Veeck believed that St. Louis was too small a market for two 
franchises, and planned to drive the Cardinals out of town. He signed many 
of the Cardinals' most locally loved ex-players and, as a result, brought 
many of their fans in to see the Browns. Veeck signed former Cardinals 
great Dizzy Dean to a broadcasting contract and tapped former Redbirds 
great Rogers Hornsby as manager. He also re-acquired former Browns fan 
favorite Vern Stephens and signed former Cardinals pitcher Harry Brecheen, 
both of whom had starred in the all-St. Louis World Series in 1944. He 
stripped Sportsman's Park of any Cardinals material and dressed it exclusively 
in Browns memorabilia. He even moved his family to an apartment under the 
stands. Veeck's showmanship and colorful promotions made the fan experience 
at a Browns game more fun and unpredictable than that at a Cardinals game. 
At the same time, the Cardinals were finally feeling the effects of Rickey's 
departure for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1942. In early 1953, Cardinals owner 
Fred Saigh was indicted for tax evasion, and ultimately pleaded no contest 
to lesser charges. Facing almost certain banishment from baseball, Saigh 
was forced to put the Cardinals up for sale. For a time, no credible offers 
surfaced from St. Louis interests, and it looked as if Veeck's all-out 
assault on the Cardinals might indeed force them out of town. However, 
Saigh turned down higher offers from out-of-town buyers in favor of a bid 
from the St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch brewery, which stepped in with 
the specific intent of keeping the Cardinals in St. Louis. Veeck realized 
that the Cardinals now had more resources than he could possibly hope to 
match, and decided to cede St. Louis to the Cardinals and move the Browns 
elsewhere. The Browns had been candidates for relocation earlier; in 1941, 
they had come close to moving to Los Angeles, nearly two decades before 
Major League Baseball eventually arrived in California. The American League 
even drew up a schedule including Los Angeles and had a meeting scheduled 
to vote on the relocation of the Browns. However, on December 7, the day 
the vote was scheduled, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. As a first step 
to moving the Browns, Veeck sold Sportsman's Park to the Cardinals not 
long after Anheuser-Busch took control of the latter. It is very likely 
he would have had to sell it in any event, as the 44-year-old park had 
fallen into disrepair. The city was threatening to have it condemned, and 
Veeck could not afford to make the necessary improvements to bring it up 
to code even with the rent from the Cardinals. Veeck attempted to move 
the Browns back to Milwaukee (where he had owned the Brewers of the American 
Association in the 1940s) for the 1953 season. However, the other American 
League owners blocked the move, seemingly for reasons that were more personal 
than business related. Veeck then tried to move the Browns to Baltimore. 
He got in touch with Mayor Tommy D'Alesandro and attorney Clarence Miles, 
who were leading an effort to bring the major leagues back to Baltimore 
after a half-century hiatus. However, he was rebuffed by the owners, still 
seething by the publicity stunts he pulled at the Browns home games. After 
the season, Veeck cut a deal with Miles which would see the Browns move 
to Baltimore. Under the plan, Veeck would sell half of his 80 percent stake 
in the Browns to Miles and several other Baltimore investors, with Veeck 
remaining as principal owner. Despite being assured by American League 
president Will Harridge that there would be no problem getting approval, 
only four owners voted aye – two short of passage. Reportedly, this was 
due to Yankees co-owner Del Webb drumming up support to move the Browns 
to Los Angeles. Miles and D'Alesandro realized that the owners were simply 
looking for a way to push Veeck out. Over the next 48 hours, Miles lined 
up enough support from his group of investors to buy out Veeck's stake 
entirely for $2.5 million. The plan called for Baltimore brewer Jerold 
Hoffberger to emerge as the largest single shareholder. With his only leverage, 
ownership of Sportsman's Park, gone and facing threats of the liquidation 
of his franchise, Veeck had little choice but to agree. With Veeck "out 
of the way", the American League owners quickly approved the relocation 
of the team to Baltimore for the 1954 season. Unlike other clubs that relocated 
in the 1950s, retaining their nickname and a sense of continuity with their 
past (such as the Brooklyn-Los Angeles Dodgers), the Browns were renamed 
upon their transfer, implicitly severing themselves from their history. 
In December 1954, the team further distanced itself from its Browns past 
by making a 17-player trade with the New York Yankees that included most 
former Browns of note still on the roster. Though the deal did little to 
improve the short-term competitiveness of the club, it did help establish 
a fresh identity for the franchise. To this day, it mentions almost nothing 
about its past in St. Louis. There are still societies to keep the memory 
of the team alive in St. Louis. The club was in St. Louis for 52 years. 
In 2006, the O's played their 53rd season in Baltimore, meaning they have 
now played in Baltimore longer than they did in St. Louis. Soon after taking 
over, the Miles-Hoffberger group renamed their new team the Baltimore Orioles. 
The name has a rich history in Baltimore, having been used by Baltimore 
baseball teams since the late 19th century. In the 1890s, a powerful and 
innovative National League Orioles squad included "Wee" Willie Keeler, 
Wilbert Robinson, Hughie Jennings and John McGraw. They won three straight 
pennants, and participated in all four of the Temple Cup Championship Series, 
winning the last two of them. That team had started as a charter member 
of the American Association in 1882. Despite its on-field success, it was 
one of the four teams contracted out of existence by the National League 
after the 1899 season. Its best players (and its manager, Ned Hanlon) regrouped 
with the Brooklyn Dodgers, turning that team into a contender. In 1901, 
Baltimore and McGraw were awarded an expansion franchise in the growing 
American League, but again the team was sacrificed in favor of a New York 
City franchise, as the team was transferred to the city in 1903. After 
some early struggles, that team eventually became baseball's most successful 
franchise – the New York Yankees. As a member of the high-minor league 
level International League, the Orioles competed at what is now known as 
the AAA level from 1903 to 1953. Baltimore's own Babe Ruth pitched for 
the Orioles before being sold to the AL Boston Red Sox in 1914. The Orioles 
of the IL won nine league championships, first in 1908, followed by a lengthy 
run from 1919 to 1925, and then dramatically in 1944, after they had lost 
their home field Oriole Park in a disastrous mid-season fire. The huge 
post-season crowds at their temporary home, Municipal Stadium, caught the 
attention of the big league brass and helped open the door to the return 
of major league baseball to Baltimore. Thanks to the big stadium, that 
"Junior World Series" easily outdrew the major league World Series which, 
coincidentally, included the team that would move to Baltimore 10 years 
later and take up occupancy in the rebuilt version of that big stadium. 
For the 2014 season, the Orioles wore a patch on their right sleeve to 
commemorate the 60th anniversary of the franchise's move to Baltimore.[3] 
The new AL Orioles took about six years to become competitive even after 
jettisoning most of the holdovers from St. Louis. Under the guidance of 
Paul Richards, who served as both field manager and general manager from 
1955 to 1958 (the first man since John McGraw to hold both positions simultaneously),[4] 
the Orioles began a slow climb to respectability. While they posted a .500 
record only once in their first five years (76-76 in 1957), they were a 
success at the gate. In their first season, for instance, they drew more 
than 1.06 million fans – more than five times what they had ever drawn 
in their tenures in Milwaukee and St. Louis. This came amid slight turnover 
in the ownership group. Miles served as team president for two years, then 
stepped down in favor of developer James Keelty. In turn, Keelty gave way 
in 1960 to financier Joe Iglehart. By the early 1960s, stars such as Brooks 
Robinson, John "Boog" Powell, and Dave McNally were being developed by 
a strong farm system. The Orioles first made themselves heard in 1960, 
when they finished 89-65, good enough for second in the American League. 
While they were still eight games behind the Yankees, it was the first 
time they had been a factor in a pennant race that late in the season since 
1944. It was also the first season of a 26-year stretch where the team 
would have only two losing seasons. Shortstop Ron Hansen was named AL Rookie 
of the Year, and first-year pitcher Chuck Estrada tied for the league lead 
in wins with 18, finishing second to Hansen in the Rookie of the Year balloting. 
After the 1965 season, Hoffberger acquired controlling interest in the 
Orioles from Iglehart and installed himself as president. He had been serving 
as a silent partner over the past decade despite being the largest shareholder. 
Frank Cashen, advertising chief of Hoffberger's brewery, became executive 
vice-president. On December 9, 1965, not long after Hoffberger took over, 
he engineered a deal which sent pitcher Milt Pappas (and several others) 
to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for slugging outfielder Frank Robinson. 
In 1966, Robinson won the Triple Crown (leading the American League in 
batting average, home runs, and runs batted in) and received the American 
League Most Valuable Player Award, becoming the first (and so far only) 
player to win the MVP Award in each league (he had been named NL MVP in 
1961, leading the Reds to the pennant). The Orioles would win their first-ever 
American League championship in 1966 and, in a major upset, swept the World 
Series by out-dueling the Los Angeles Dodgers aces Sandy Koufax and Don 
Drysdale. Pappas, meanwhile, went 30-29 in a little over two years with 
the Reds before being traded. Although he would go on to have back-to-back 
17-win seasons for the Chicago Cubs in 1971 and 1972, including a no-hitter 
in the latter season, this did not help the Reds, who ended up losing the 
1970 World Series to Robinson and the Orioles. This trade has become renowned 
as one of the most lopsided in baseball history, including a mention by 
Susan Sarandon in her opening soliloquy in the 1988 film Bull Durham: "Bad 
trades are a part of baseball. I mean, who can forget Frank Robinson for 
Milt Pappas?" The Orioles farm system had begun to produce a number of 
high-quality players and coaches who formed the core of winning teams; 
from 1966 to 1983, the Orioles won three World Series titles (1966, 1970, 
and 1983), six American League pennants (1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1979, 
and 1983), and five of the first six American League East titles. They 
played baseball the Oriole Way, an organizational ethic best described 
by longtime farm hand and coach Cal Ripken, Sr.'s phrase "perfect practice 
makes perfect!" The Oriole Way was a belief that hard work, professionalism, 
and a strong understanding of fundamentals were the keys to success at 
the major league level. It was based on the belief that if every coach, 
at every level, taught the game the same way, the organization could produce 
"replacement parts" that could be substituted seamlessly into the big league 
club with little or no adjustment. This led to a run of success from 1966 
to 1983 which saw the Orioles become the envy of the league, and the winningest 
team in baseball. During this stretch, three different Orioles were named 
Most Valuable Player (Frank Robinson in 1966, Boog Powell in 1970, and 
Cal Ripken, Jr. in 1983), four Oriole pitchers combined for six Cy Young 
Awards (Mike Cuellar in 1969, Jim Palmer in 1973, 1975, and 1976, Mike 
Flanagan in 1979, and Steve Stone in 1980), and three players were named 
Rookie of the Year (Al Bumbry in 1973, Eddie Murray in 1977, and Cal Ripken, 
Jr. in 1982). It was also during this time that the Orioles severed their 
last remaining financial link to their era in St. Louis. In 1979, Hoffberger 
sold the Orioles to his longtime friend, Washington attorney Edward Bennett 
Williams. As part of the deal, Williams bought the publicly traded shares 
Donald Barnes had issued in 1936 while the team was still in St. Louis, 
making the franchise privately held once again. During this rise to prominence, 
Weaver Ball came into vogue. Named for fiery manager Earl Weaver, it was 
defined by the Oriole trifecta of "Pitching, Defense, and the Three-Run 
Home Run." When an Oriole GM was told by a reporter that Earl Weaver, as 
the skipper of a very talented team, was a "push-button manager", he replied, 
"Earl built the machine and installed all the buttons!" As Frank and Brooks 
Robinson grew older, newer stars emerged, including multiple Cy Young Award 
winner Jim Palmer and switch-hitting first baseman Eddie Murray. With the 
decline and eventual departure of two other professional sports teams in 
the area, the NFL's Baltimore Colts and baseball's Washington Senators, 
the Orioles' excellence paid off at the gate, as the team cultivated a 
large and rabid fan base at old Memorial Stadium. After winning the World 
Series in 1983, the Orioles organization began to decline. In 1986 the 
team suffered its first losing season since 1967. The 1988 season started 
unceremoniously when the Orioles lost their first 21 contests, and ended 
the year at 54-107, the worst record for the franchise since 1939. The 
horrendous season resulted in the dismissal of manager Cal Ripken, Sr. 
and his replacement by former Oriole great Frank Robinson. The next year, 
the O's sported a new look, replacing the cartoonish bird with a more realistic 
one. The 1989 squad, led by surprise ace Jeff Ballard, rebounded to finish 
in second place behind the Toronto Blue Jays with an 87-75 record, staying 
in contention until the last week of the season and earning the nickname 
of the "Why Not?" Orioles. Frank Robinson earned the 1989 American League 
Manager of the Year Award for his efforts in leading the team out of the 
abyss. Two years later, Cal Ripken, Jr. won American League MVP honors 
in the team's final season at Memorial Stadium. He was also named MVP of 
the 1991 All-Star Game, played in Toronto's SkyDome. In 1992, with grand 
ceremony, the Orioles began their season in a brand new ballpark, Oriole 
Park at Camden Yards. The name of the new park though did have much controversy 
in it. Many felt that since the Orioles' new home was so close to Babe 
Ruth's birthplace that the new park should have been named after Ruth instead 
of being indirectly named after the Earl of Camden, Charles Pratt, who 
was a Britisher who never set foot on American soil. There was also the 
superficial connection to the fact that Ruth played for the Orioles early 
in his career, but the Orioles team that Ruth played for was in no way 
related to the Orioles team that moved to Baltimore from St. Louis. In 
1993, Peter Angelos bought the Baltimore Orioles, which returned the team 
to local ownership. However, Angelos' ownership resulted in a number of 
controversies. The Orioles also hosted the 1993 All-Star Game. On September 
6, 1995, in a game between the Orioles and the California Angels at Camden 
Yards, Cal Ripken, Jr. finally broke Lou Gehrig's consecutive games streak 
of 2,130 games. This was later voted the all-time baseball moment of the 
20th century by fans from around the country in 1999. Ripken's streak would 
finally end at 2,632 straight games, finally sitting on September 20, 1998. 
In 1996, team owner Peter Angelos hired Pat Gillick away from the Toronto 
Blue Jays to be the Orioles' general manager. Gillick brought in several 
players like catcher B. J. Surhoff, relief pitcher Randy Myers, and second 
baseman Roberto Alomar. Under Gillick and manager Davey Johnson, the Orioles 
finally returned to postseason play by winning the American League's wild 
card spot in the 1996 season. The team set a major league record for home 
runs in a single season, with 257, and upset the Cleveland Indians in the 
Division Series before falling to the New York Yankees in a controversial 
American League Championship Series (a fan, Jeffrey Maier, interfered with 
a fly ball hit by Derek Jeter in Game 1; the play was ruled a home run 
and the Yankees eventually won the game). The Orioles followed up by winning 
the AL East Division title in 1997, going "wire-to-wire" (being in first 
place from the first day of the season to the last). After eliminating 
the Seattle Mariners in four games in the opening round, the team lost 
again in the ALCS, this time to the underdog Indians, in which each Oriole 
loss was by 1 run. After the Orioles failed to advance to the World Series 
in either playoff, Johnson resigned as manager following a dispute with 
Angelos, with pitching coach Ray Miller taking his place. With Miller at 
the helm, the Orioles found themselves not only out of the playoffs, but 
also with a losing season. When Gillick's contract expired in 1998, it 
was not renewed, and Angelos brought in Frank Wren to take over as GM. 
The Orioles added volatile slugger Albert Belle, but the team's woes continued 
in the 1999 season, with stars like Rafael Palmeiro, Roberto Alomar (who 
joined his brother Sandy Jr. in Cleveland), and Eric Davis leaving via 
free agency. After a second straight losing season, Angelos fired both 
Miller and Wren. He named Syd Thrift the new GM and brought in former Cleveland 
manager Mike Hargrove to lead the team. In 1998, the Orioles updated the 
Bird in their logo, and then once again in 1999 to bring it to its present 
form. The first decade of the 21st century saw the Orioles struggle due 
to the combination of lackluster play on the team's part, a string of ineffective 
management, and the ascent of the Yankees and Red Sox to the top of the 
game – each rival having a clear advantage in financial flexibility due 
to their larger media market size. Further complicating the situation for 
the Orioles was the relocation of the National League's Montreal Expos 
franchise to nearby Washington, D.C. in 2004. Orioles owner Peter Angelos 
demanded compensation from Major League Baseball, as the new Washington 
Nationals threatened to carve into the Orioles fan base and television 
dollars. However, there was some hope that having competition in the larger 
Baltimore-Washington metro market would spur the Orioles to field a better 
product to compete for fans with the Nationals. Beginning with the 2003 
season, big changes began to sweep through the organization to try to snap 
the losing ways. General manager Syd Thrift was fired and to replace him, 
the Orioles hired Jim Beattie as the Executive Vice President and Mike 
Flanagan as the Vice President of Baseball Operations'. After another losing 
season, manager Mike Hargrove was not retained and Yankees coach Lee Mazzilli 
was brought in as the new manager. The team signed powerful hitters in 
shortstop Miguel Tejada, catcher Javy López, and former Oriole firstbaseman 
Rafael Palmeiro. The following season, the Orioles traded for outfielder 
Sammy Sosa. The 2005 season may go down as one of the most controversial 
in the Orioles' history. The Orioles began the season with a tremendous 
start, holding onto first place in the AL East division for 62 straight 
days. However, turmoil on and off the field began to take its toll as the 
team started struggling around the All-Star break, dropping them close 
to the surging Yankees and Red Sox. Injuries to Luis Matos, Javy López, 
Brian Roberts, Sammy Sosa, and Larry Bigbie came within weeks of each other. 
The team was increasingly dissatisfied with the front office's and manager 
Lee Mazzilli's "band-aid" moves to help the team through this period of 
struggle. Various minor league players such as Single-A Frederick outfielder 
Jeff Fiorentino were brought up in place of more experienced players such 
as David Newhan, who batted .311 the previous season. On July 15, 2005, 
Rafael Palmeiro collected his 3,000th hit in Seattle; but 15 days later 
he was suspended for a violation of MLB's drug policy, after testing positive 
for the anabolic steroid stanozolol. The Orioles continued tumbling, falling 
out of first place and further down the AL East standings. This downfall 
cost Lee Mazzilli his managerial job in early August, allowing bench coach 
and 2003 managerial candidate Sam Perlozzo to take over as interim manager 
and lead the team to a 23-32 finish. The Orioles called up Dave Cash from 
the Ottawa Lynx to serve as the team's first base coach. The Orioles' 32-60 
second half record is, from a percentage standpoint, the worst in baseball 
history after playing .600 ball for the first 70 days[citation needed]. 
The club's major offseason acquisition, Sammy Sosa, posted his worst performance 
in a decade, with 14 home runs and a .221 batting average. The Orioles 
did not attempt to re-sign him, considering his exorbitant salary, his 
miserable performance, and his stormy relationship with batting coach Terry 
Crowley and teammates including Miguel Tejada. The Orioles also allowed 
Rafael Palmeiro to file for free agency and publicly stated they would 
not re-sign him. On August 25, pitcher Sidney Ponson was arrested for DUI 
and on September 1 the Orioles moved to void his contract (on a morals 
clause) and release him. The Major League Baseball Players Association 
filed a grievance on Ponson's behalf and the case was sent to arbitration. 
The case was finally resolved in late 2008 with Ponson winning at the arbitration 
hearings. Following the disappointing 2005 season, it was clear major changes 
needed to be made within the Orioles. In the front office, Executive VP 
Jim Beattie was not re-signed, allowing Mike Flanagan to become the sole 
GM of the Orioles. Shortly after, Jim Duquette was hired as Vice President 
of Baseball Operations, which was Flanagan's previous position. Duquette 
made it clear at his signing that he reported to Flanagan, so the "two-headed 
GM" will not exist anymore. The Orioles also fired assistant General Manager 
Ed Kenney and asked for the resignation of Dave Ritterpusch, Director of 
Baseball Information Systems. There were also drastic changes in the Orioles 
coaching staff. Perlozzo was named the new manager, and unlike Mazzilli, 
was given full freedom to name his coaching staff. Perlozzo led off strong 
by convincing Atlanta pitching coach Leo Mazzone, who had revolutionized 
the careers of many pitchers in Atlanta, to become the pitching coach for 
the Orioles. He retained hitting coach Terry Crowley and first base coach 
Dave Cash. Former base coach and 1983 World Series MVP Rick Dempsey replaced 
the late Elrod Hendricks as the bullpen coach, with Tom Trebelhorn resuming 
third base coach. Perlozzo rounded out his staff with former Cubs and Phillies 
manager Lee Elia as the bench coach. The roster changes of 2005 were prefaced 
with Peter Angelos' comments: "We are coming back strong next year. I know 
you have heard that tune before, but this time it will literally come true." 
The Orioles allowed Rafael Palmeiro, Sammy Sosa, and B. J. Surhoff to become 
free agents. They also set their wishlist: An everyday first baseman, an 
experienced starter, a closer, a defensive catcher, outfield help, more 
defense, and more speed. However, their offseason moves showed no differences 
from past years. The Orioles were not able to re-sign closer B. J. Ryan, 
who signed a landmark deal with the Toronto Blue Jays. They were also locked 
out in bids to sign first baseman Paul Konerko, outfielder Johnny Damon, 
and starter Paul Byrd. The Orioles were rumoured to have a deal with outfielder 
Jeromy Burnitz, but his agent balked, supposedly at language regarding 
the physical, which was deemed by legal experts to be rather standard, 
and Burnitz signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Orioles chose not to 
enter the bidding for players like A. J. Burnett and Kevin Millwood, whose 
asking prices were far beyond what the Orioles were willing to pay. The 
only target the Orioles managed to sign was catcher Ramón Hernández. Locked 
out of pursuits to sign top-tier players, the Orioles decided to make several 
moves to allow minor league prospects more time to develop. This led to 
bringing in players like Jeff Conine and Kevin Millar, both of whom are 
known for their positive presence in the clubhouse. The Orioles also made 
several trades to bring in needed players. They first traded disgruntled 
reliever Steve Kline for LaTroy Hawkins, then traded for outfielder Corey 
Patterson, who brought speed and defense to the outfield, and traded former 
closer Jorge Julio and John Maine for experienced starter Kris Benson. 
The Orioles also addressed future free agents by extending the contract 
of outfielder Jay Gibbons and third baseman Melvin Mora, and recently signed 
a contract extension with second baseman Brian Roberts. The team's Opening 
Day roster featured top prospect Nick Markakis, a potential A.L. "Rookie 
of the Year", the best young position player the Orioles' farm system has 
produced since Brian Roberts. Markakis represented the revival of the Orioles' 
once proud farm system, which features four players listed in Baseball 
America's 2006 list of the top 100 prospects in minor league baseball. 
The Orioles' lack of movement over the course of the offseason frustrated 
many, including Miguel Tejada. This led to him stating, controversially, 
that he "wanted to play for a winner", and "perhaps a change of scenery 
is needed." The Oriole front office began to talk to many teams interested 
in Tejada as a trade. It was rumored that the Boston Red Sox offered All-Star 
outfielder Manny Ramírez for Tejada, though no Orioles officials confirmed 
this. There were also talks of Mark Prior being offered for Tejada. After 
several weeks, teammate Melvin Mora facilitated a conference call between 
the Orioles and Tejada where Tejada backed down and said his comments were 
intended to provoke the Orioles to make more moves in free agency. The 
Orioles finished the up and down 2006 season with a record of 70-92, 27 
games behind the AL East leading Yankees. A new President of Baseball of 
Operations named Andy MacPhail was brought in about halfway through the 
2007 season. MacPhail had had success as general manager of the Minnesota 
Twins in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and had been the CEO of the Chicago 
Cubs from 1994–2006. MacPhail spent the remainder of the 2007 season assessing 
the talent level of the Orioles, and determined that significant steps 
needed to be made if the Orioles were ever to be a contender again in the 
American League East. He completed two blockbuster trades during the next 
off-season, each sending a premium player away in return for five prospects 
or (or younger less expensive players). Tejada, who had hit .296 with 18 
HR and 81 RBI in 2007, went to the Houston Astros in exchange for outfielder 
Luke Scott, pitchers Matt Albers, Troy Patton, and Dennis Sarfate, and 
third baseman Mike Costanzo. Also, the newly designated ace of the Orioles 
rotation Érik Bédard, who went 13-5 with a 3.16 ERA in 2007 with 221 strikeouts, 
was sent to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for top outfield prospect 
Adam Jones, left-handed pitcher George Sherrill, and three minor league 
pitchers Chris Tillman, Kam Mickolio, and Tony Butler. The Bedard trade 
in particular would go down as one of the most lop-sided and successful 
trades in the history of the franchise. While MacPhail would find success 
in most of his trades made for the Orioles over the long-term, the veteran 
stop acquisitions that he would make would not often pan out, and as a 
result, the team would never finish higher than 4th place in the AL East, 
or with more than 69 wins, while MacPhail was in charge. Although some 
of his free agent signings would have positive contributions (such as reliever 
Koji Uehara), most gave mediocre returns, at best. In particular, the Orioles 
never managed to cobble together a successful pitching staff during this 
time. Their most consistent starting pitcher from 2008–2011 was the late 
bloomer Jeremy Guthrie who was named the Opening Day starter in 3 of the 
4 seasons and had a cumulative 4.12 ERA during this stretch. Following 
Davey Johnson's dismissal after the 1997 playoff season, Orioles ownership 
struggled to find a manager that they liked, and this time period was no 
exception. Dave Trembley was brought on as an interim manager in June 2007, 
and had the interim tag removed later that year. Trembley was at the helm 
again in 2008 and 2009 but was never able to lead the team out of the cellar 
in the AL East. After starting the 2010 season a dismal 15-39, Dave Trembley 
was fired and third base coach Juan Samuel was named the interim manager. 
The Orioles were seeking a more permanent solution at manager as the 2010 
season continued to unfold, and two-time AL Manager of the Year Buck Showalter 
was eventually hired in July 2010. The Orioles went 34–23 after Buck took 
over, foreshadowing that a brighter future might be on the horizon, and 
giving Orioles fans renewed hope and optimism for the team's future. The 
Orioles made some aggressive moves to improve the team in 2011 in the hopes 
of securing their first playoff berth since 1997. Andy MacPhail completed 
trades to bring in established veterans like Mark Reynolds and J. J. Hardy 
from the Diamondbacks and Twins, respectively. Veteran free agents Derrek 
Lee and Vladimir Guerrero were also brought in to help improve the offense. 
At the 2011 trade deadline, fan favorite Koji Uehara was sent to the Texas 
Rangers in exchange for Chris Davis and Tommy Hunter, a move that would 
not pay immediate dividends, but would be crucial to the team's later success. 
While these moves had varying impacts, the Orioles did score 95 more runs 
in 2011 than they had the previous year. The team still finished last in 
the AL East due to the utter failures of the team's pitching staff. Brian 
Matusz compiled one of the highest single-season ERAs in MLB history (10.69 
over 12 starts) and every single pitcher who started a game for the Orioles 
in 2011 ended the season with an ERA of 4.50 or higher except for Jeremy 
Guthrie. The Orioles finished 30th out of 30 MLB teams that year with a 
4.89 team ERA. Andy MacPhail's contract was not renewed in October 2011 
and a search for a new GM began. After a public interview process where 
several candidates declined to take the position, ex-GM Dan Duquette was 
brought in to serve as the Executive Vice-President of Baseball Operations. 
Duquette wasted no time in overhauling the Orioles roster, especially the 
MLB-worst pitching staff. He traded fan favorite Jeremy Guthrie to the 
Colorado Rockies in exchange for Jason Hammel. He brought in new free agent 
starting pitcher Wei-Yin Chen from the Nippon Professional Baseball league, 
and Miguel González was signed as a minor league free agent. Nate McLouth 
was signed to a minor league deal in June 2012 and would prove to make 
a significant impact down the stretch. This year also marked the debut 
of the much hyped prospect Manny Machado. The Orioles won 93 games in 2012 
(after winning 69 in the previous year) thanks in large part to a 29–9 
record in one-run games, and a 16–2 record in extra inning games. The difference 
between this Orioles bullpen and bullpens past was like night and day, 
led by Jim Johnson and his 51 saves. He finished with a 2.49 ERA that season 
with Darren O'Day, Luis Ayala, Pedro Strop, and Troy Patton all finishing 
as well with ERAs under 3.00. Experts[who?] were amazed as the team continued 
to outperform expectations, but regression never came that year. They battled 
with the New York Yankees for first place in the AL East up until September, 
and would earn their first playoff berth in 15 years by winning the second 
wildcard spot in the American League. In the 'sudden death' wildcard game 
against the Texas Rangers, Joe Saunders (acquired in August of that year 
in exchange for Matt Lindstrom) defeated Yu Darvish to help the Orioles 
advance to the divisional round, where they faced a familiar opponent, 
the Yankees. The Orioles forced the series to go five games (losing games 
1 and 3 of the series, while winning 2 and 4), but CC Sabathia outpitched 
the Orioles Jason Hammel in Game 5 and the Orioles were eliminated from
