Conrado Eugenio Marrero Ramos (April 25, 1911 – April 23, 2014), nicknamed 
"Connie", was a Cuban professional baseball pitcher.[1] The right-handed 
Marrero pitched in Major League Baseball from 1950 to 1954 for the Washington 
Senators. Marrero made his major league debut when he was 38 years old, 
and was one of the oldest players in the league throughout the duration 
of his time in the major leagues. He was a popular star in his native Cuba, 
where he had a long and successful career in amateur baseball, pitching 
for Cuba in several Amateur World Series competitions, and playing several 
excellent seasons with the professional Cuban League and the minor league 
Havana Cubans. His nicknames in Cuba were "El Guajiro de Laberinto" (The 
Peasant from Laberinto), reflecting his rural origins, "El Premier", and 
"El Curvo."[2] Marrero's pitches were primarily "slow stuff—curves, sliders 
and knucklers."[3] Roberto González Echevarría provides the following description: 
"A bit plump, of less than average height, with short arms and small hands, 
Marrero looked, in uniform, like someone in a baseball costume, not a player. 
He looked more like a Spanish grocer or peasant than an athlete."[4] At 
age 102, Marrero was the oldest living former Major League Baseball player 
at the time of his death.[5] Marrero was born on a farm called El Laberinto 
in the district of Sagua la Grande, Cuba; he was of Canary Islands descent. 
He played for various teams in his rural region, then in 1938 at age 26 
or 27 was invited to pitch for the Cienfuegos team of the Cuban Amateur 
League. The league played on Sundays from March through September. The 
team was sponsored by a department store, which employed him during the 
week. Marrero was one of the most popular and successful pitchers in Cuban 
Amateur League history, winning 123 games from 1938 to 1945. According 
to González Echevarría, Marrero as an amateur was considered a bigger drawing 
card than any professional pitcher in Cuba.[6] From 1939 to 1943, Cuba 
hosted the second through sixth Amateur World Series competitions at La 
Tropical Stadium in Havana. Marrero was a pitcher for the Cuban national 
team at the second Amateur World Series in 1939, the first in which Cuba 
competed. Only three teams competed and Cuba easily won, with Marrero contributing 
a victory in the only game he pitched. In the third Amateur World Series 
in 1940, Marrero led the Cuban team to victory, going 3–2 with a 1.15 earned 
run average (ERA), and was named the most valuable player of the series. 
In the fourth Amateur World Series in 1941, Marrero won three games, but 
the series ended in a tie between Cuba and the Venezuela team. Venezuela 
was relying on the pitching of Daniel Canónico, who went 4–0 with an ERA 
of 1.69 in 32 innings. Cuba challenged Venezuela to a playoff game, which 
was scheduled to allow Canónico time to rest. On October 23, 1941 Marrero 
faced Canónico for the championship. Venezuela, helped by an error by the 
Cuban third baseman, scored 3 runs in the bottom of the first inning; Marrero 
was pulled after 2 innings, and Canónico held the Cubans scoreless until 
the ninth inning. Venezuela held on to win the game 3–1, winning their 
first Amateur World Series.[7] In 1942 Marrero had his best amateur season, 
going 22–5 with a 1.22 ERA. For the fifth Amateur World Series, the Cuban 
national team was selected by a fan poll, and Marrero was the top vote-getter. 
The series featured a rematch between Marrero and Venezuela's Canónico. 
This time the Cubans won 8–0, and the Cuban team regained the Cup. In 1943 
Marrero was suspended from the Amateur League for six months for accepting 
payment for a game and consequently was not selected for the Amateur World 
Series team. In 1944 he returned with a 21–8 season and was again selected 
for the Amateur World Series team. The series was played in Caracas, Venezuela 
and ended in controversy. There was a three-way tie among Mexico, Venezuela, 
and Cuba, forcing a playoff. However, after some questionable calls by 
the umpires, who were provided by Venezuela, Cuba withdrew from the tournament 
in protest. In 1945 Marrero again pitched for Cienfuegos in the Amateur 
League. He was caught pitching in a non-league game a second time and given 
an indefinite suspension. He then decided to turn professional.[8] In the 
winter of 1946/47, Marrero signed with the Oriente team of the National 
Federation league.[9] Marrero had a good season, leading the league in 
victories with an 8–5 record. After the end of the Federation season, he 
switched to the Almendares team of the regular Cuban League for the last 
month of the season. Although he played only a minor role—pitching in four 
games and going 1–0—he participated on the winning team of one of the most 
famous pennant races in Cuban League history.[10] In the spring of 1947, 
Marrero, as part of a Cuban all-star team, had a chance to pitch against 
major league teams that were playing in Havana during spring training. 
He beat the New York Yankees in a rain-shortened 7-inning game, allowing 
one run and four hits. A week later (now pitching for the minor league 
Havana Cubans), he suffered a tough 1–0 loss against the Brooklyn Dodgers, 
allowing four hits and striking out eight.[11] The next Cuban League season, 
1947/48, Marrero returned to Almendares in the Cuban League (which was 
now officially sanctioned by Major League Baseball) and pitched perhaps 
his best season, going 12–2, setting the Cuban League all-time records 
for shutouts (eight) and ERA (1.12) and winning the most valuable player 
award. However, with Almendares tied with the Habana team with one game 
left, he was unable to clinch the pennant as he lost to Habana's Alex Patterson 
in a 3–2 game.[12] In 1948/49 Marrero went 6–4, as Almendares easily won 
another pennant. As the league champions, Almendares represented Cuba in 
the first Caribbean Series played in Havana in 1949. Cuba swept the series 
with Marrero contributing a one-run, four-hit, complete-game victory in 
the only game he pitched. In 1949/50 Marrero went 7–3 and led the Cuban 
League with an ERA of 2.66, as Almendares again won the pennant. At the 
second Caribbean Series, Marrero went 0–2 as Cuba was upset by Panamá. 
The next winter Marrero went 11–7 with a 2.37 ERA, leading the Cuban League 
in wins and innings pitched. Almendares, however, was edged out by Habana 
for the pennant in a one-game playoff. In 1951/52 Marrero went 6–9, and 
the next winter he went 8–8.[13] In 1953/54, Marrero went 7–5 and helped 
Almendares regain the pennant. In the sixth Caribbean Series Marrero pitched 
a shutout in his only appearance, but Puerto Rico won the series. In 1954/55 
Marrero went 2–3 and began to be used primarily in relief. Almendares won 
the pennant and went to the Caribbean Series, but Marrero did not make 
an appearance. In 1955/56 Marrero became the manager of Almendares, but 
the team fell to last place, making his tenure as manager a short one. 
He pitched in four games and went 1–0. After being released by Almendares, 
Marrero signed with the Tigres de Marianao for the 1956–1957 season, where 
he pitched 19 innings in seven games with a 1.37 ERA. Marianao won the 
pennant and Marrero pitched in his last Caribbean Series, lasting 3 1⁄3 
innings against Panamá in a game that was eventually won by his teammate, 
Jim Bunning. Cuba went on to win their fourth victory in nine series. The 
next season was Marrero's last, as he pitched only four innings in three 
appearances.[14] Marrero's career Cuban League record was 69–43. His .600 
winning percentage is the sixth highest in league history among pitchers 
with at least 40 wins. (Of the five pitchers with a higher career winning 
percentage, three are in the U.S. Baseball Hall of Fame—José Méndez, Ray 
Brown and Martín Dihigo; the other two are Carlos Royer and Camilo Pascual.) 
Despite not pitching in the Cuban League until he was 35 years old, his 
69 victories ranks 10th on the Cuban League all-time list.[15] From 1947 
to 1949, Marrero pitched for the Havana Cubans in the Florida International 
League. The team was a minor league affiliate of the Washington Senators. 
In 1947 Marrero went 25–6 and led the league in wins (25), complete games 
(28), strikeouts (251), shutouts (seven) and ERA (1.66). On July 12, 1947, 
Marrero pitched a no hitter against the Tampa Smokers, allowing only one 
base runner on a hit by pitch. The Cubans finished in first place with 
a 105–45 record. The Cubans also won the playoffs against the Miami Sun 
Sox and the Tampa Smokers, with Marrero pitching two shutouts.[16] In 1948 
Marrero went 20–11 with a 1.67 ERA. The Cubans again finished in first 
place with a 97–57 record, their third consecutive title. In the playoffs 
they beat both the Lakeland Pilots and the Tampa Smokers. In 1949 Marrero 
won the league MVP award after going 25–8 with 11 shutouts and a 1.53 ERA. 
He set a league record by pitching 44 consecutive scoreless innings. Havana 
again finished in first place with a 95–57 record (the fourth of their 
five consecutive first-place finishes) and beat Miami Beach in the first 
round of the playoffs. In the second round, however, the Cubans were swept 
by Tampa, with Marrero losing to Tampa's Oscar del Calvo.[17] After five 
years with the major league Washington Senators, Marrero returned to Havana 
to play with the minor league team from 1955 to 1957. In 1954 the team 
had moved to the International League and had been renamed the Havana Sugar 
Kings. Marrero didn't travel with the team, pitching only for their home 
games. In 1955 he went 7–3, pitched five shutouts (one of them a one-hitter), 
and had a 2.69 ERA. In 1956, the 45-year-old pitcher pitched only 45 innings 
and went 3–1. His only loss was to an even older pitcher, Miami's Satchel 
Paige. In 1957 Marrero pitched only five innings in three games, as his 
pitching career came to an end.[18] From 1950 to 1954, Marrero pitched 
for the American League Washington Senators. During that period, Washington's 
roster also included a number of other Cuban players, such as pitchers 
Sandy Consuegra and Camilo Pascual and catcher Mike Guerra. The Senators 
were a second division team, never finishing higher than fifth place in 
the eight-team league while Marrero pitched for them. His first major league 
appearance came on April 21, 1950. In 1950 he pitched 152 innings in 27 
games (19 of them starts), and finished with a 6–10 record and a 4.50 ERA. 
In 1951 Marrero led his team in wins and innings pitched, going 11–9 in 
187 innings with a 3.90 ERA. On April 26, 1951, he pitched a one-hitter 
against the Philadelphia Athletics, beating them 2–1. The only hit given 
up by Marrero was a home run by Barney McCosky.[19] In 1952 he went 11–8 
with a 2.88 ERA (ninth in the league), as Washington improved to a 78–76 
record. The following year he went 8–7 with a 3.03 ERA. In 1954 he was 
the oldest player in the major leagues, as he slipped to 3–6 with a 4.75 
ERA. On January 24, 1955, the 43-year-old Marrero was released by the Senators.[20] 
Marrero finished his major league career with a 39–40 record and a 3.67 
ERA, which was eight percent better than the league average (after adjusting 
for ballpark differences). He pitched 51 complete games, including seven 
shutouts, in his 94 starts. He was selected to the 1951 American League 
All-Star team, though he didn't play; at age 40, he was the oldest first-time 
All-Star to that point.[21] After retiring as a player, Marrero became 
a coach for the Havana Sugar Kings. He was listed as a scout in 1960 by 
the Boston Red Sox during Bucky Harris's term as Boston's general manager.[22] 
After the Cuban Revolution, Marrero was one of the most prominent players 
to remain in Cuba under Fidel Castro, thereby providing a link between 
the old professional Cuban League and the new amateur Cuban national baseball 
system and its Cuban National Series. He was a pitching coach for several 
years for the Havana Industriales and was also a roving pitching instructor. 
Marrero is a respected figure in Cuba; his portrait is shown on a mural 
at Estadio Latinoamericano, and he threw out the first pitch at the 1984 
baseball World Championship.[23] He also threw out the first pitch at the 
1999 Baltimore Orioles – Cuban national baseball team exhibition series.[24] 
In 2006, Marrero was featured along with his Almendares teammate, Hall 
of Famer Monte Irvin, in a documentary about Cuban baseball, "The Bases 
Are Loaded."[25] He did not draw a major league pension and was reported 
to be living modestly in a room in a relative's Havana apartment.[26] As 
recently as early 2007, a baseball tour of Cuba advertised that participants 
would have an opportunity to visit with the 95-year-old Marrero.[27] On 
April 25, 2013, Marrero celebrated his 102nd birthday with family and friends, 
"an unlit Cuban cigar in his mouth and a baseball cap on his head." Earlier 
in the year, he received a $20,000 payout from Major League Baseball, a 
payment granted to those who had played between 1947 and 1979, which had 
been held up due to issues surrounding the United States's embargo on Cuba. 
Marrero was a fan of the current Cienfuegos team.[28] Marrero died on April 
23, 2014, at his home in Havana just 2 days shy of his 103rd birthday.
