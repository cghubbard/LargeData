The Boys of Summer is a 1972 non-fiction baseball book by Roger Kahn. After 
recounting his childhood in Brooklyn and his life as a young reporter on 
the New York Herald Tribune, the author relates some history of the Brooklyn 
Dodgers up to their victory in the 1955 World Series. He then tracks the 
lives of the players (Clem Labine, George Shuba, Carl Erskine, Andy Pafko, 
Joe Black, Preacher Roe, Pee Wee Reese, Carl Furillo, Gil Hodges, Roy Campanella, 
Duke Snider, Jackie Robinson and Billy Cox) over the subsequent years as 
they aged. The title of the book is taken from a Dylan Thomas poem that 
describes "the boys of summer in their ruin".[1][2] Upon publication in 
1972, The Boys of Summer was a commercial and critical success. It is often 
mentioned in discussions of the best baseball books, although some reviewers 
have criticized it for what they have perceived as excessive sentimentality. 
Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote in his New York Times review that the book 
had "very real shortcomings" including "Mr. Kahn's unremitting tone of 
veneration, as if all his memories had been removed from the altars of 
the world's great cathedrals", but nevertheless found it to be "a book 
that succeeded for me despite almost everything about it."[3] In contrast 
to Haupt's criticism, Heywood Hale Broun, in his Chicago Times review, 
praised Kahn for vividly re-creating a romantic era in the history of American 
sports and culture through memories "so keen that those of us old enough 
can weep, and those who are young can marvel at a world where baseball 
teams were the center of a love beyond the reach of intellect, and where 
baseball players were worshipped or hated with a fervor that made bubbles 
in our blood."[4] George Frazier of The Boston Globe wrote "I cannot conceive 
that this year, nor next year, nor the year after that, will produce a 
more important book – a better written one, a more consistently engrossing 
one than this portrait of the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s, as they were 
in the sinew and swiftness of their youth and as they are now."[5] Conversely, 
Los Angeles Times book critic David L. Ulin, while acknowledging that it 
is "perhaps the most celebrated baseball book of the last 50 years", omitted 
it from his own 2011 list of best baseball books, saying in agreement with 
Haupt that he found it "too sentimental, too sugary, when the Brooklyn 
Dodgers teams Kahn describes were anything but."[6] In the Los Angeles 
Times’ first-ever review of The Boys of Summer, Robert Kirsch alludes to 
the timelessness of the themes Kahn takes up through the lens of his own 
personal experiences, admitting "without embarrassment" that "this book 
brought me to tears more than once…and to laughter and to that quiet confrontation 
with enemy Time."[7] The book has reportedly sold about three million copies 
and had about ninety printings.[8] In 2002, a Sports Illustrated panel 
placed The Boys of Summer second on a list of "The Top 100 Sports Books 
of All Time", describing it as "a novelistic tale of conflict and change, 
a tribute, a civic history, a piece of nostalgia and, finally, a tragedy."[9] 
A documentary based on the book, written by Marty Bell and narrated by 
Sid Caesar, was produced in 1983 and released direct-to-video.[10][11]
