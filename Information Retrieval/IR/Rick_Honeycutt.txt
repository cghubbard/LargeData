As player As coach Frederick Wayne "Rick" Honeycutt (born June 29, 1954) 
is the pitching coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Honeycutt was a left-handed 
pitcher for 6 different teams over 21 years from 1977 to 1997. He pitched 
in 30 post-season games, including 20 league championship series games 
and 7 World Series games, and never lost a game, going 3-0. Honeycutt gave 
up zero runs in the 1988 and 1990 post-seasons, and was a member of the 
Oakland Athletics 1989 World Series championship team. Honeycutt was born 
in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and graduated from Lakeview – Fort Oglethorpe 
High School in Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. Honeycutt played for the Tennessee 
Volunteers baseball team from 1973–1976, where he was an All-American first 
baseman-pitcher and won the Southeastern Conference batting title with 
a .404 mark. He played summer ball in Liberal, Kansas, in the Jayhawk League, 
for Bob Cerv. A teammate there, who played SS, was Condredge Holloway, 
a fellow U. of Tennessee baseball and football star. Honeycutt was originally 
drafted in the 17th round of the 1976 draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
After 1 1⁄2 seasons in their minor league system, the Pirates traded him 
to the Seattle Mariners in August 1977 to complete an earlier trade for 
Dave Pagan. He made his major league debut on August 24, 1977 against the 
Toronto Blue Jays. He pitched two innings of relief, struck out 3, allowed 
2 hits and no runs. His first start was against the New York Yankees on 
August 31. He pitched 7.1 innings in that start, allowing 3 runs. He finished 
the season 0-1, but got his first victory in his first start the following 
year, beating the Minnesota Twins on April 7, 1978. He matured into a control 
pitcher, being selected to the 1980 All-Star Game. While he was pitching 
on September 30, 1980, he was caught using a thumbtack to illegally cut 
the ball. He was ejected and suspended for 10 games.[1] Following the 1980 
season, he was traded with Larry Cox, Willie Horton, Mario Mendoza and 
Leon Roberts to the Texas Rangers for Brian Allard, Rick Auerbach, Ken 
Clay, Jerry Gleaton and Richie Zisk. In 1983, Honeycutt represented the 
Rangers in the All-Star Game. On August 19, 1983, Honeycutt was traded 
from the Rangers to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Dave Stewart and Ricky 
Wright. Honeycutt led the American League in ERA in 1983 with 2.42, although 
he was traded to the Dodgers late in the season. In 1987, Honeycutt was 
traded to the Oakland Athletics for a player to be named later, who would 
be Tim Belcher. Converted from a starting pitcher to relief in 1988 by 
Oakland, he became a set-up man to Dennis Eckersley, posting a series of 
sub-3.7 ERAs from 1988 through 1993. He was the oldest major league player 
in both 1996 and 1997. He made 268 starts and 529 relief appearances in 
his career, logging 2,160 innings pitched and compiling 109 wins and 38 
saves. Following his playing career, Honeycutt spent a year coaching his 
kids' teams before joining the Dodgers as their minor league pitching coordinator.[2] 
Honeycutt joined the Dodgers coaching staff as pitching coach for the 2006 
season. He has also launched a sporting goods and apparel business in Chattanooga, 
Tennessee. Honeycutt and Mariano Duncan were the only holdovers from Grady 
Little's 2007 coaching staff to return on new Dodgers' manager Joe Torre's 
2008 coaching staff. Honeycutt also remained as pitching coach when Don 
Mattingly replaced Torre after the 2010 season. When Mattingly left the 
team after the 2015 season, Honeycutt was the only coach to remain on the
