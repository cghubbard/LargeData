Darin Charles Erstad (/ˈdærən ˈɜːrstæt/; born June 4, 1974) is an American 
former professional baseball player and the current head coach of the University 
of Nebraska Cornhuskers baseball team. Prior to 2007, he had played with 
the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim franchise (1996-2006) before signing 
with the Chicago White Sox in 2007. He batted and threw left-handed. He 
was a two-time MLB All-Star and a three-time Gold Glove Award winner. Erstad 
graduated in 1992 from Jamestown High School in Jamestown, North Dakota. 
He was a kicker and punter on the school football team, logging a school-record 
50-yard field goal. Erstad also played hockey (36 goals and 24 assists 
in 26 games) and participated in track and field (winning state titles 
in 110 and 300-meter hurdles). Erstad played American Legion baseball (Jamestown 
had no high school baseball team) and hit .492 with 18 home runs and 86 
RBI for Jamestown in 1992. He was also 10-2 with a 2.18 ERA as a pitcher, 
and was named AP North Dakota Athlete of the Year in 1992. Erstad attended 
the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, playing baseball there for three years 
and held the school record for career hits with 261. In his final year 
there, Erstad hit .410 with 19 home runs and 79 RBIs, earning First-Team 
All-American status and was a finalist for the 1995 Golden Spikes Award.[1] 
Darin started his junior campaign on a tear and never stopped hitting. 
He was at his best against the conference's top team, Oklahoma. In five 
games with the first-place Sooners, he batted .429 and blasted three home 
runs. Oklahoma lefty Mark Redman — with whom Darin would share conference 
Player of the Year honors — was among his biggest victims. The Huskers 
finished 35-23, and Darin led the Big Eight with a .410 average. He was 
the only batter in the conference to surpass 100 hits, and also led all 
players with seven triples. Named a First Team All-American by Collegiate 
Baseball, Darin set career highs with 19 homers and 76 RBIs. Erstad was 
also the starting punter on the Cornhuskers football team and was part 
of their 1994 National Championship squad, averaging 42.6 yards per punt, 
the 14th best mark in the country that year. In his 14-season career, Erstad 
compiled a .282 batting average with 124 home runs and 699 RBIs in 1654 
games. He was selected to the American League All-Star team twice (1998, 
2000) and had eight game-ending, or "walk-off", RBI in his career. The 
then-titled California Angels chose Erstad as the first pick overall in 
the 1995 Major League Baseball draft from the University of Nebraska. He 
made his major league debut the next year, batting .284 over 57 games. 
He played his first full season in 1997, batting .299 with 16 home runs 
and 99 runs scored. Posting similarly solid statistics the next year, Erstad 
made his first of two All-Star appearances before having a disappointing 
season in 1999. Erstad had a career season in 2000, when he finished eighth 
in the American League in MVP voting. That year, he led the American League 
in hits (240), singles (170) and at-bats (676); he was second in total 
bases (366) and third in runs (121). He also hit .355, finishing second 
in the batting race behind Nomar Garciaparra (.372), became the first player 
in Major League history to record 100 RBIs as a leadoff hitter, and won 
the AL Silver Slugger Award. On June 10, 2000, Erstad hit a double in the 
Angels' 10-3 win over Arizona. With a major league-leading 100 hits in 
61 games, he became the fastest to reach the 100-hit mark since Hall of 
Famer Heinie Manush did it in 60 games for the 1934 Washington Senators. 
With three hits on Aug. 29, 2000, he reached 200 hits faster than any player 
in 65 years. Erstad was just 26 years old at the end of the season, an 
age at which many players enter their prime, leading many to believe more 
superstar seasons were ahead of him. He is one of only five batters, through 
August 2009, to have hit both a leadoff and walk-off home run in the same 
game (having done so in 2000), the others being Billy Hamilton (1893), 
Victor Power (1957), Reed Johnson (2003), and Ian Kinsler (2009).[2] After 
2001, however, Erstad never hit as high as .300, nor hit over 10 home runs 
or slugged over .400 (2004) in any season. In some years he was the least 
productive offensive regular starter at his position. Despite all this, 
Erstad managed to be a vital part of the 2002 World Series Champion Anaheim 
Angels. After batting .421 in the American League Division Series against 
the New York Yankees and .364 in the American League Championship Series 
against the Minnesota Twins, Erstad batted .300 in the seven-game series 
vs. the National League Champion San Francisco Giants. He hit a key home 
run in Game 6 of the series with the Angels trailing 5-3 in the eighth 
inning and facing elimination, and he also caught the final out of Game 
7 hit by Kenny Lofton off Troy Percival into center field. When the Angels 
won the World Series in 2002, Erstad became just the second player hailing 
from North Dakota to be on a World Series winning roster. Roger Maris was 
the first with the 1961 Yankees and 1967 Cardinals. Throughout Erstad's 
Angels career, his defense remained exceptionally strong. He led all major 
league center fielders in range factor (3.39) in 2002. Erstad won Gold 
Glove awards in 2000, 2002, and 2004, when he made a transition from the 
outfield to first base. He was the only player in MLB history to have won 
Gold Gloves as an infielder and outfielder and first to win the award at 
different positions, though all outfield Gold Gloves are voted on together, 
until Plácido Polanco won an NL Gold Glove as a third basemen for the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[3] Though he compiled a career high 21 game hit streak in 2005, 
he only played in 40 games in 2006, his last season with the Angels. In 
11 years with the franchise, Erstad compiled a .286 batting average and 
a cumulative .339 postseason average over three seasons. He currently ranks 
near the top of several franchise records. Having signed a $750,000 contract 
in the off-season, Erstad hit a home run in his first at-bat as a member 
of the Chicago White Sox on opening day 2007 off CC Sabathia. He finished 
the season having batted .248 with a .650 OPS over 87 games. He played 
the following two seasons with the Houston Astros. Erstad found success 
in the first season, batting .276, but struggled near the end of the second 
season as a role player, ending the season with a .194 batting average. 
When catcher Chris Coste joined Erstad on the Astros roster in July 2009, 
they became the first two players born in North Dakota to play together 
on the same team in major league history.[4] On June 17, 2010, when asked 
if he would continue playing baseball, Erstad said that he was "done".[5] 
Erstad was on the 2015 ballot to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of 
Fame. Erstad received one vote and fell off the ballot.[6] On July 5, 2010, 
the Lincoln Journal Star reported that Erstad accepted a position to become 
a volunteer coach for the Nebraska baseball team. On July 8, Nebraska head 
baseball coach Mike Anderson revealed Erstad as the college team's next 
hitting coach.[7] On June 2, 2011, after Anderson was fired, Erstad was 
hired as Nebraska's head baseball coach.       National champion         Postseason

all Angels games over the radio;[10] most North Dakota stations only carry 
Minnesota Twins games. As of July 2009, he ranked second to Travis Hafner
