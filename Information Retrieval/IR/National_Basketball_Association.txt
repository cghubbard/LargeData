United States: Canada: The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the 
pre-eminent men's professional basketball league in North America, and 
is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league 
in the world. It has 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada), 
and is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB),[2] which is recognized 
by FIBA (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the 
national governing body for basketball in the United States. The NBA is 
one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States 
and Canada. NBA players are the world's best paid sportsmen, by average 
annual salary per player.[3][4] The league was founded in New York City 
on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA).[1][5] 
The league adopted the name National Basketball Association on August 3, 
1949, after merging with its rival National Basketball League (NBL). The 
league's several international as well as individual team offices are directed 
out of its head offices located in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue 
in New York City. NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are directed out 
of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey. The Basketball Association 
of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas 
in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. On November 
1, 1946, in Toronto, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers 
at Maple Leaf Gardens, in a game the NBA now regards as the first played 
in its history.[6] The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the 
Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional 
basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League and the NBL, 
the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas 
in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA 
was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading 
independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters. For instance, the 1948 
ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 
title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title. 
Prior to the 1948–49 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, 
Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA 
as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.[7] 
Following the 1948–49 season, the BAA took in the remainder of the NBL: 
Syracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo. In deference 
to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name 
was changed from the BAA to the National Basketball Association in spite 
of having the same BAA governing body including Podoloff.[7] The new league 
had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities,[8] 
as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories. In 1950, the 
NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a process that continued until 1953–54, 
when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises: the New 
York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia Warriors, Minneapolis Lakers, 
Rochester Royals, Fort Wayne Pistons, Tri-Cities Blackhawks, and Syracuse 
Nationals, all of which remain in the league today. The process of contraction 
saw the league's smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks 
shifted from the Tri-Cities to Milwaukee in 1951, and then to St. Louis 
in 1955. The Rochester Royals moved from Rochester, New York, to Cincinnati 
in 1957 and the Pistons relocated from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Detroit 
in 1957. Japanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in 
the 1947–48 season when he played for the New York Knicks. He remained 
the only non-white player in league history prior to the first African-American, 
Harold Hunter, signing with the Washington Capitols in 1950.[9][10] Hunter 
was cut from the team during training camp,[9][11] but several African-American 
players did play in the league later that year, including Chuck Cooper 
with the Celtics, Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton with the Knicks, and Earl 
Lloyd with the Washington Capitols. During this period, the Minneapolis 
Lakers, led by center George Mikan, won five NBA Championships and established 
themselves as the league's first dynasty.[12] To encourage shooting and 
discourage stalling, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock in 
1954.[13] If a team does not attempt to score a field goal (or the ball 
fails to make contact with the rim) within 24 seconds of obtaining the 
ball, play is stopped and the ball given to its opponent. In 1957, rookie 
center Bill Russell joined the Boston Celtics, who already featured guard 
Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach, and went on to lead the club to eleven 
NBA titles in thirteen seasons. Center Wilt Chamberlain entered the league 
with the Warriors in 1959 and became a dominant individual star of the 
1960s, setting new single game records in scoring (100) and rebounding 
(55). Russell's rivalry with Chamberlain became one of the greatest rivalries 
in the history of American team sports. The 1960s were dominated by the 
Celtics. Led by Russell, Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach, Boston won eight 
straight championships in the NBA from 1959 to 1966. This championship 
streak is the longest in NBA history. They did not win the title in 1966–67, 
but regained it in the 1967–68 season and repeated in 1969. The domination 
totaled nine of the ten championship banners of the 1960s.[14] Through 
this period, the NBA continued to strengthen with the shift of the Minneapolis 
Lakers to Los Angeles, the Philadelphia Warriors to San Francisco, the 
Syracuse Nationals to Philadelphia to become the Philadelphia 76ers, and 
the St. Louis Hawks moving to Atlanta, as well as the addition of its first 
expansion franchises. The Chicago Packers (now Washington Wizards) became 
the ninth NBA team in 1961. From 1966 to 1968, the league expanded from 
9 to 14 teams, introducing the Chicago Bulls, Seattle SuperSonics (now 
Oklahoma City Thunder), San Diego Rockets (who relocated to Houston four 
years later), Milwaukee Bucks, and Phoenix Suns. In 1967, the league faced 
a new external threat with the formation of the American Basketball Association 
(ABA). The leagues engaged in a bidding war. The NBA landed the most important 
college star of the era, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor). 
However, the NBA's leading scorer, Rick Barry, jumped to the ABA, as did 
four veteran referees—Norm Drucker, Earl Strom, John Vanak, and Joe Gushue.[15] 
In 1969, Alan Siegel, who oversaw the design of Jerry Dior's Major League 
Baseball logo a year prior, created the modern NBA logo inspired by the 
MLB's. It incorporates the silhouette of the legendary Jerry West based 
on a photo by Wen Roberts, although NBA officials denied a particular player 
as being its influence because, according to Siegel, "They want to institutionalize 
it rather than individualize it. It's become such a ubiquitous, classic 
symbol and focal point of their identity and their licensing program that 
they don't necessarily want to identify it with one player." The iconic 
logo debuted in 1971 and would remain a fixture of the NBA brand.[16][17] 
The ABA succeeded in signing a number of major stars in the 1970s, including 
Julius Erving of the Virginia Squires, in part because it allowed teams 
to sign college undergraduates. The NBA expanded rapidly during this period, 
one purpose being to tie up the most viable cities. From 1966 to 1974, 
the NBA grew from nine franchises to 18. In 1970, the Portland Trail Blazers, 
Cleveland Cavaliers, and Buffalo Braves (now the Los Angeles Clippers) 
all made their debuts expanding the league to 17.[18] The New Orleans Jazz 
(now in Utah) came aboard in 1974 bringing the total to 18. Following the 
1976 season, the leagues reached a settlement that provided for the addition 
of four ABA franchises to the NBA, raising the number of franchises in 
the league at that time to 22. The franchises added were the San Antonio 
Spurs, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and New York Nets (now the Brooklyn 
Nets). Some of the biggest stars of this era were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 
Rick Barry, Dave Cowens, Julius Erving, Elvin Hayes, Walt Frazier, Moses 
Malone, Artis Gilmore, George Gervin, Dan Issel, and Pete Maravich. The 
end of the decade, however, saw declining TV ratings, low attendance and 
drug-related player issues – both perceived and real – that threatened 
to derail the NBA. The league added the ABA's innovative three-point field 
goal beginning in 1979 to open up the game. That same year, rookies Larry 
Bird and Magic Johnson joined the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers 
respectively, initiating a period of significant growth in fan interest 
in the NBA throughout the country and the world. In 1984, they played against 
each other for the first time in the NBA Finals. Johnson went on to lead 
the Lakers to five titles, and Bird went on to lead the Celtics to three. 
Also in the early 1980s, the NBA added one more expansion franchise, the 
Dallas Mavericks, bringing the total to 23 teams. Later on, Larry Bird 
won the first three three-point shooting contests. Former league commissioner 
David Stern who took office on February 1, 1984 before retiring February 
1, 2014, oversaw the expansion and growth of the NBA to a global commodity. 
Michael Jordan entered the league in 1984 with the Chicago Bulls, providing 
an even more popular star to support growing interest in the league. This 
resulted in more cities demanding teams of their own. In 1988 and 1989, 
four cities got their wishes as the Charlotte Hornets, Miami Heat, Orlando 
Magic, and Minnesota Timberwolves made their NBA debuts, bringing the total 
to 27 teams. In the first year of the 1990s, the Detroit Pistons would 
win the second of their back-to-back titles, led by coach Chuck Daly and 
guard Isiah Thomas. Jordan and Scottie Pippen would lead the Bulls to two 
three-peats in eight years during the 1991–98 seasons. Hakeem Olajuwon 
won back-to-back titles with the Houston Rockets in 1994 and 1995. The 
1992 Olympic basketball Dream Team, the first to use current NBA stars, 
featured Michael Jordan as the anchor, along with Bird, Johnson, David 
Robinson, Patrick Ewing, Scottie Pippen, Clyde Drexler, Karl Malone, John 
Stockton, Chris Mullin, Charles Barkley, and Christian Laettner. Eleven 
players on the Dream Team have been inducted individually into the Basketball 
Hall of Fame. In 1995, the NBA expanded to Canada with the addition of 
the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors. In 2001, the Vancouver 
Grizzlies relocated to Memphis, which left the Raptors as the only Canadian 
team in the NBA. In 1996, the NBA created a women's league, the Women's 
National Basketball Association (WNBA). In 1998, the NBA owners began a 
lockout which lasted 191 days and was settled on January 18, 1999. As a 
result of this lockout the 1998–99 NBA season was reduced from 82 to 50 
games (61% of a normal season), and the All-Star Game was cancelled. The 
San Antonio Spurs won their first championship, and first by a former ABA 
team, by beating the New York Knicks, who were the first, and to this date, 
the only, eighth seed to ever make it to the NBA Finals. Since the breakup 
of the Chicago Bulls championship roster in the summer of 1998, the Western 
Conference has dominated, with the Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio Spurs 
combining to win the title nine out of fourteen seasons. Tim Duncan and 
David Robinson won the 1999 championship with the Spurs, and Shaquille 
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant started the 2000s with three consecutive championships 
for the Lakers. The Spurs reclaimed the title in 2003 against the Nets. 
In 2004, the Lakers returned to the Finals, only to fall in five games 
to the Detroit Pistons. After the Spurs took home the Larry O'Brien Championship 
Trophy in 2005, the 2006 Finals featured two franchises making their inaugural 
Finals appearances. The Miami Heat, led by their star shooting guard, Dwyane 
Wade, and Shaquille O'Neal, who had been traded from the Lakers during 
the 2004 summer, won the series over the Dallas Mavericks in six after 
losing the first two games. The Lakers/Spurs dominance continued in 2007 
with a four-game sweep by the Spurs over the Cleveland Cavaliers, who were 
led by LeBron James. The 2008 Finals saw a rematch of the league's highest 
profile rivalry, the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, with the Celtics 
winning, for their 17th championship, thanks to their new big three of 
Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, and Kevin Garnett. In 2009, Kobe Bryant and the 
Lakers returned to the Finals, this time defeating the Dwight Howard-led 
Orlando Magic.[19] Bryant won his first Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable 
Player Award in his 13th season after leading the Lakers to their first 
NBA championship since the departure of Shaquille O'Neal.[20] The 2010 
NBA All-Star Game was held at Cowboys Stadium in front of the largest crowd 
ever, 108,713.[21] At the end of that season, the Celtics and the Lakers 
renewed their rivalry from 2008 when they met again in the NBA Finals for 
a record 12th time. The Lakers won the title by winning Game 7, 83–79.[22] 
Before the start of the 2010–11 season the NBA had an exciting summer with 
one of the most anticipated free agent classes of all time. Two of which 
signed, and one resigned, with the Miami Heat, leading to a season that 
was heavily centered on their eventual success or failure at taking home 
the championship. The Heat, led by LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris 
Bosh, did in fact make the Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, in a rematch 
for the franchises of the 2006 Finals. The Mavericks, led by Dirk Nowitzki 
(the eventual NBA Finals MVP), took the series in six games. This was the 
Mavericks' first title. Veterans Shawn Marion, Jason Kidd, Jason Terry, 
and Peja Stojaković celebrated their first NBA championship. On July 1, 
2011, at 12:01 am, the NBA announced another lockout.[23] After the first 
few weeks of the season were canceled, the players and owners ratified 
a new collective bargaining agreement on December 8, 2011, setting up a 
shortened 66-game season.[24] Following the shortened season, the Miami 
Heat made a return to the Finals with the trio of Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, 
and Chris Bosh against Oklahoma City Thunder's Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, 
and James Harden. The Heat went on to defeat the Thunder in five games, 
capturing their second NBA title in six years. Their success would continue 
into the following season, which concluded with their victory over the 
San Antonio Spurs in the 2013 NBA Finals. The two teams would meet for 
a rematch in the following year's Finals, where the Spurs defeated the 
Heat in five games. Following that series, LeBron James announced that 
he would return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. James led the Cavaliers to 
their second Finals appearance, where they fell to the Golden State Warriors 
in six games. Most recently, in a rematch, the 2016 NBA Finals concluded 
with the Cavaliers defeating the Warriors in seven games to win their first 
NBA Championship. Following pioneers like Vlade Divac (Serbia) and Dražen 
Petrović (Croatia) who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing 
number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere 
in the world to starring in the NBA. Since 2006, the NBA has faced Euroleague 
teams in exhibition matches in the NBA Europe Live Tour and since 2009 
in the Euroleague American Tour. The 2013–14 season opened with a record 
92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 39 
countries and comprising over 20% of the league[25] In 2001, an affiliated 
minor league, the National Basketball Development League, now called the 
NBA Development League (or D-League) was created.[26] Before the league 
was started, there were strong rumors that the NBA would purchase the Continental 
Basketball Association, and call it its developmental league. Two years 
after the Hornets' relocation to New Orleans, the NBA returned to North 
Carolina as the Charlotte Bobcats were formed as an expansion team in 2004. 
The Hornets temporarily relocated to Oklahoma City in 2005 for two seasons 
because of damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. The team returned to New 
Orleans in 2007. A new official game ball was introduced on June 28, 2006, 
for the 2006–07 season, marking the first change to the ball in over 35 
years and only the second ball in 60 seasons.[27] Manufactured by Spalding, 
the new ball featured a new design and new synthetic material that Spalding 
claimed offered a better grip, feel, and consistency than the original 
ball. However, many players were vocal in their disdain for the new ball, 
saying that it was too sticky when dry, and too slippery when wet. Commissioner 
Stern announced on December 11, 2006, that beginning January 1, 2007, the 
NBA would return to the traditional leather basketball in use prior to 
the 2006–07 season. The change was influenced by frequent player complaints 
and confirmed hand injuries (cuts) caused by the microfiber ball.[28] The 
Players' Association had filed a suit in behalf of the players against 
the NBA over the new ball.[29] As of 2006, the NBA team jerseys are manufactured 
by Adidas, which purchased the previous supplier, Reebok. The Federal Bureau 
of Investigation (FBI) began an investigation on July 19, 2007, over allegations 
that veteran NBA referee Tim Donaghy bet on basketball games he officiated 
over the past two seasons and that he made calls affecting the point spread 
in those games.[30] On August 15, 2007, Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal 
charges related to the investigation. However, he could face additional 
charges if it is determined that he deliberately miscalled individual games. 
Donaghy claimed in 2008 that certain refs were friendly with players and 
"company men" for the NBA. Donaghy alleged that refs influenced the outcome 
of certain playoff and finals games in 2002 and 2005. NBA commissioner 
David Stern denied the allegations and said Donaghy was a convicted felon 
and a "singing, cooperating witness".[31] Donaghy served 15 months in prison 
and was released in November 2009.[32] According to an independent study 
by Ronald Beech of Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between 
the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings, although the refs increased 
the Lakers' chances of winning through foul calls during the game, there 
was no collusion to fix the game. On alleged "star treatment" during Game 
6 by the refs toward certain players, Beech claimed, "there does seem to 
be issues with different standards and allowances for different players." 
[33] The NBA Board of Governors approved the request of the Seattle SuperSonics 
to relocate to Oklahoma City on April 18, 2008.[34] The team, however, 
could not move until it had settled a lawsuit filed by the city of Seattle, 
which was intended to keep the SuperSonics in Seattle for the remaining 
two seasons of the team's lease at KeyArena. Following a court case, the 
city of Seattle settled with the ownership group of the SuperSonics on 
July 2, 2008, allowing the team to move to Oklahoma City immediately in 
exchange for terminating the final two seasons of the team's lease at KeyArena.[35] 
The Oklahoma City Thunder began playing in the 2008–09 season. The first 
outdoor game in the modern era of the league was played at the Indian Wells 
Tennis Garden on October 11, 2008, between the Phoenix Suns and the Denver 
Nuggets.[36] A referee lockout began on September 1, 2009, when the contract 
between the NBA and its referees expired. The first preseason games were 
played on October 1, 2009, and replacement referees from the WNBA and NBA 
Development League were used, the first time replacement referees had been 
used since the beginning of the 1995–96 season.[37] The NBA and the regular 
referees reached a deal on October 23, 2009.[38] The first official NBA 
league games on European ground took place in 2011. In two matchups, the 
New Jersey Nets faced the Toronto Raptors at the O2 Arena in London in 
front of over 20,000 fans. The NBA laid off around 114 league employees—about 
11 percent of all the league office workforce—in July 2011 to save money.[39] 
The 2011–12 NBA season, scheduled to begin November 1, 2011, with a matchup 
between the defending champion Dallas Mavericks and the Chicago Bulls, 
was postponed due to a labor dispute. The lockout officially ended on December 
8, 2011, when players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement, 
and the season began on Christmas Day. The New Jersey Nets officially changed 
their name to the Brooklyn Nets on April 30, 2012.[40] They began playing 
in the New York City borough of Brooklyn in the 2012–13 season. The NBA 
announced in October 2012 that it would begin fining players for flopping.[41][42] 
After the 2012–13 season, the New Orleans Hornets renamed themselves the 
Pelicans.[43] During the 2013–14 season, Stern retired as commissioner 
after 30 years, and deputy commissioner Adam Silver ascended to the position 
of commissioner. During that season's playoffs, the Bobcats officially 
reclaimed the Hornets name, and by agreement with the league and the Pelicans, 
also received sole ownership of all history, records, and statistics from 
the Pelicans' time in Charlotte. As a result, the Hornets are now officially 
considered to have been founded in 1988, suspended operations in 2002, 
and resumed in 2004 as the Bobcats, while the Pelicans are officially treated 
as a 2002 expansion team.[44] (This is somewhat similar to the relationship 
between the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens in the NFL.) Donald Sterling, 
who was then-owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, received a lifetime ban 
from the NBA on April 29, 2014, after racist remarks he made became public. 
Sterling was also fined US$2.5 million, the maximum allowed under the NBA 
Constitution.[45] Becky Hammon was hired by the San Antonio Spurs on August 
5, 2014, as an assistant coach, becoming the second female coach in NBA 
history but the first full-time coach.[46][47] This also makes her the 
first full-time female coach in any of the four major professional sports 
in North America.[47] The NBA announced on April 15, 2016, that it would 
allow all 30 of its member clubs to sell corporate sponsor advertisement 
patches on official game uniforms, beginning with the 2017–18 season. The 
sponsorship advertisement patches would appear on the left front of jerseys, 
opposite Nike's logo, and would measure approximately 2.5 by 2.5 inches. 
The NBA will become the first major North American professional sports 
league to allow corporate sponsorship logos on official team uniforms.[48] 
The first team to announce a jersey sponsorship was the Philadelphia 76ers, 
who agreed to a deal with StubHub.[49] The NBA originated in 1946 with 
11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and relocations 
currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams and 
one is located in Canada. The current league organization divides thirty 
teams into two conferences of three divisions with five teams each. The 
current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004–05 season. Reflecting 
the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, 
most teams are in the eastern half of the country: thirteen teams are in 
the Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three in the Mountain, and 
five in the Pacific. Following the summer break, teams begin training camps 
in late September. Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate 
players (especially rookies), scout the team's strengths and weaknesses, 
prepare the players for the rigorous regular season, and determine the 
12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they will begin 
the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less 
than two years of experience to the NBA development league. After training 
camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches 
are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and overseas. 
The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October. During the regular 
season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team faces opponents 
in its own division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays six of 
the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times (24 
games), and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each 
team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). 
This asymmetrical structure means the strength of schedule will vary between 
teams (but not as significantly as the NFL or MLB). Over five seasons, 
each team will have played 80 games against their division (20 games against 
each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road), 180 games against the rest 
of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the 
road), and 150 games against the other conference (10 games against each 
team, 5 at home, 5 on the road). The NBA is one of only two of the four 
major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada in which 
teams play every other team during the regular season (the other being 
the National Hockey League). Each team hosts and visits every other team 
at least once every season. From 2005 to 2008, the NBA had the distinction 
of being the only one of the four major leagues in which all teams play 
every other team. The NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules 
games on Christmas Day.[50] The league has been playing games regularly 
on the holiday since 1947,[51] though the first Christmas Day games were 
not televised until 1983–84.[52] Games played on this day have featured 
some of the best teams and players.[50][51][52] Christmas is also notable 
for NBA on television, as the holiday is when the first NBA games air on 
network television each season.[51][52] Games played on this day have been 
some of the highest-rated games during a particular season. In February, 
the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual NBA All-Star Game. Fans 
vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the Internet, and the 
top vote-getters at each position in each conference are given a starting 
spot on their conference's All-Star team. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 
14 All-Stars. Then, Eastern conference players face the Western conference 
players in the All-Star game. The player with the best performance during 
the game is rewarded with a Game MVP award. Other attractions of the All-Star 
break include the Rising Stars Challenge (originally Rookie Challenge), 
where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 
basketball game, with the current format pitting U.S. players against those 
from the rest of the world; the Skills Challenge, where players compete 
to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling 
in the fastest time; the Three Point Contest, where players compete to 
score the most amount of three-point field goals in a given time; and the 
NBA Slam Dunk Contest, where players compete to dunk the ball in the most 
entertaining way according to the judges. These other attractions have 
varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have 
paid for naming rights. Shortly after the All-Star break is the trade deadline, 
which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) 
at 3pm Eastern Time.[53][54] After this date, teams are not allowed to 
exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although 
they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed 
right before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general 
managers. Around the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during 
this time that voting begins for individual awards, as well as the selection 
of the honorary, league-wide, post-season teams. The Sixth Man of the Year 
Award is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more 
games coming off the bench than actual games started). The Rookie of the 
Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Most 
Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown 
the most improvement from the previous season. The Defensive Player of 
the Year Award is awarded to the league's best defender. The Coach of the 
Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference 
to a team. The Most Valuable Player Award is given to the player deemed 
the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally, Sporting News 
awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) Executive of the Year Award 
to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for 
the benefit of his franchise. The post-season teams are the All-NBA Team, 
the All-Defensive Team, and the All-Rookie Team; each consists of five 
players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at 
each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are 
two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. 
There are also two All-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players 
regardless of position. NBA Playoffs begin in late April, with eight teams 
in each conference competing for the Championship. The three division winners, 
along with the team with the next best record from the conference are given 
the top four seeds. The next four teams in terms of record are given the 
lower four seeds. Having a higher seed offers several advantages. Since 
the first seed begins the playoffs playing against the eighth seed, the 
second seed plays the seventh seed, the third seed plays the sixth seed, 
and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed, having a higher seed means a 
team faces a weaker team in the first round. The team in each series with 
the better record has home court advantage, including the First Round. 
This means that, for example, if the team who receives the 6 seed has a 
better record than the team with the 3 seed (by virtue of a divisional 
championship), the 6 seed would have home court advantage, even though 
the other team has a higher seed. Therefore, the team with the best regular 
season record in the league is guaranteed home court advantage in every 
series it plays. For example, in 2006, the Denver Nuggets won 44 games 
and captured the Northwest Division and the #3 seed. Their opponent was 
the #6 seed Los Angeles Clippers, who won 47 games and finished second 
in the Pacific Division. Although Denver won its much weaker division, 
the Clippers had home-court advantage and won the series in 5. The playoffs 
follow a tournament format. Each team plays an opponent in a best-of-seven 
series, with the first team to win four games advancing into the next round, 
while the other team is eliminated from the playoffs. In the next round, 
the successful team plays against another advancing team of the same conference. 
All but one team in each conference are eliminated from the playoffs. Since 
the NBA does not re-seed teams, the playoff bracket in each conference 
uses a traditional design, with the winner of the series matching the 1st 
and 8th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 4th 
and 5th seeded teams, and the winner of the series matching the 2nd and 
7th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 3rd and 
6th seeded teams. In every round, the best-of-7 series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 
home-court pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 
1, 2, 5, and 7, while the other plays at home in games 3, 4, and 6. From 
1985 to 2013, the NBA Finals followed a 2–3–2 pattern, meaning that one 
team had home court in games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while the other played at 
home in games 3, 4, and 5.[55] The final playoff round, a best-of-seven 
series between the victors of both conferences, is known as the NBA Finals, 
and is held annually in June. The victor in the NBA Finals wins the Larry 
O'Brien Championship Trophy. Each player and major contributor—including 
coaches and the general manager—on the winning team receive a championship 
ring. In addition, the league awards the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable 
Player Award to the best performing player of the series. On August 2, 
2006, the NBA announced the new playoff format. The new format takes the 
three division winners and the second-place team with the best record and 
rank them 1–4 by record. The other 4 slots are filled by best record other 
than those other 4 teams.[56] Previously, the top three seeds went to the 
division winners. The Boston Celtics have won the most championships with 
17 NBA Finals wins. The second most successful franchise is the Los Angeles 
Lakers, who have 16 overall championships (11 in Los Angeles, 5 in Minneapolis). 
Following the Lakers, are the Chicago Bulls with six championships, all 
won over an 8-year span during the 1990s, and the San Antonio Spurs with 
five championships, all since 1999. Current teams that have no NBA Finals 
appearances: The National Basketball Association has sporadically participated 
in international club competitions. From 1987 to 1999 the NBA champions 
played against the continental champions of the Fédération Internationale 
de Basketball (FIBA) in the McDonald's Championship. This tournament was 
won by the NBA invitee every year it was held.[57] In 2012, a ticket cost 
from $10 to $3,000 apiece, depending on the location of the seat and the 
success of the teams that were playing.[58] According to Nielsen's survey, 
the NBA has the youngest audience, with 45 percent of its viewers under 
35, but the least likely, along with Major League Baseball, to be watched 
by women, who make up only 30% of the viewership. It also has the highest 
share of black viewers with 45 percent of its viewers being black and only 
about 40 percent of viewers being white, making it the only top north american 
sport that doesn't have a white majority audience.[59] Following pioneers 
like Vlade Divac (Serbia) and Dražen Petrović (Croatia) who joined the 
NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have 
moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. 
Below is a short list of foreign players who have won NBA awards or have 
been otherwise recognized for their contributions to basketball, either 
currently or formerly active in the league: On some occasions, young players, 
most but not all from the English-speaking world, have attended U.S. colleges 
before playing in the NBA. Notable examples are: Since 2006, the NBA has 
faced Euroleague teams in exhibition matches in the NBA Europe Live Tour 
and since 2009 in the Euroleague American Tour. The 2013–14 season opened 
with a record 92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 
39 countries and comprising over 20% of the league[61] The NBA defines 
"international" players as those born outside the 50 United States and 
Washington, D.C. This means that: 1961 1966 1967 1968 1970 1974 1980 1988
