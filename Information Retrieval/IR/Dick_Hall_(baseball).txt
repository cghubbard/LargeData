Richard Wallace Hall (born September 27, 1930) was a Major League Baseball 
(MLB) pitcher and part-time outfielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates (1952–57 
and 1959), Kansas City Athletics (1960), Baltimore Orioles (1961–66 and 
1969–71) and Philadelphia Phillies (1967–68). He helped the Orioles win 
the 1966 and 1970 World Series and 1969 and 1971 American League Pennant. 
Hall was the first pitcher to record a win in League Championship Series 
play, on October 4, 1969.[1] Hall was the oldest player in the American 
League in 1970 and 1971. He ranks 22nd on the MLB Career WHIP List (1.102), 
39th on the MLB Career Walks per 9 Innings Pitched List (1.69) and 47th 
on the MLB Career Strikeout to Walk List (3.14). After moving to the Orioles 
in 1961, Hall transitioned from a starting pitcher into a bullpen member, 
spot starter, and relief pitcher who was paired with relief aces Hoyt Wilhelm 
and then Stu Miller. Hall's best season came in 1964, when he pitched 87.2 
innings with a WHIP of 0.844 and an ERA of 1.85. One of the best control 
pitchers of his generation, Hall is an example of a player who had more 
success in their 30s rather than their 20s. Hall won the Most Valuable 
Player award in the Pacific Coast League (AAA minor league) in 1959, his 
first year playing in the league. He was voted to the Orioles Hall of Fame 
in 1989. In 16 years Hall had a 93–75 win–loss record, 495 games, 74 games

allowed, 130 home runs allowed, 236 walks allowed, 741 strikeouts, 18 hit 
batsmen, 1 wild pitch, 5,085 batters faced, 70 intentional walks and a 
3.32 ERA. In his Postseason career, Hall tossed 8.2 innings over 5 games, 
and did not give up an earned run, registering 2 wins and 2 saves. Hall 
was an important member of the 1966 World Series Champion Baltimore Orioles, 
but he did not pitch in the that series. As an outfielder he played in 
669 games and had 714 at bats, 79 runs, 150 hits, 15 doubles, 4 triples, 
4 home runs, 56 RBI, 6 stolen bases, 61 walks, .210 batting average, .271
