Steven Jakob Matz (born May 29, 1991) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his 
MLB debut on June 28, 2015. Steven Matz was born on May 29, 1991 in Stony 
Brook, New York, the second child of Ron and Lori Matz. He has an older 
brother, Jonathan, and younger sister, Jillian.[1] Ron Matz coached a travel 
baseball team and is a service manager at a Jeep dealership in West Islip.[2] 
Lori is an administrative employee at Comsewogue High School in Port Jefferson 
Station, New York.[1] Matz and his family, as far back as his grandparents, 
are devout fans of the New York Mets.[3] Matz began receiving pitching 
lessons at age 10, from former MLB pitcher Neal Heaton.[4] He attended 
Ward Melville High School in East Setauket, New York, and pitched and played 
first base for the school's baseball team. In high school, he enjoyed a 
rivalry with nearby Patchogue-Medford High School pitcher, friend and current 
major leaguer Marcus Stroman (Stroman also took pitching lessons from Neal 
Heaton for several years). Matz and Stroman were teammates on the same 
elite travel team, The Paveco Storm, for several years in junior high and 
high school. The two were roommates during the Area Code Games and pitched 
against each other multiple times in high school.[5] Despite not receiving 
attention from college or professional scouts until June of his junior 
year, Matz was named Newsday's Long Island Player of the Year and was given 
the Yastrzemski Award as the best high school ballplayer in Suffolk County 
in his senior year.[6] The New York Mets selected Matz in the second round, 
with the 72nd overall selection, of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft.[7][8][9] 
The Mets did not have a first round pick in that year's draft and did not 
expect Matz to drop to them in the second round. Some Mets scouts attribute 
this to his playing high school baseball in the Northeast, an area which 
does not receive much attention from professional scouts.[2] Matz originally 
committed to attend Coastal Carolina University to play college baseball 
for the Coastal Carolina Chanticleers, but the Mets agreed with him on 
a $895,000 signing bonus ten minutes before the August 15 signing deadline 
for draft picks. Matz had scheduled a flight to attend his orientation 
at Coastal Carolina for the next day.[10] While pitching in an instructional 
league in 2010, he experienced elbow discomfort.[11] A doctor diagnosed 
Matz with a torn ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow, requiring Tommy 
John surgery.[2] He did not make his professional debut until 2012,[4] 
when he pitched for the Kingsport Mets of the Rookie-level Appalachian 
League. He compiled a 2–1 win–loss record a 1.55 earned run average (ERA) 
in 29 innings pitched with Kingsport.[2] Before the 2013 season, Matz worked 
on developing a curveball to replace his slider, at the advice of Frank 
Viola and Ron Romanick.[4] That year, he pitched for the Savannah Sand 
Gnats of the Class A South Atlantic League, where he had a 5–6 win–loss 
record and a 2.62 ERA while recording 121 strikeouts in 106 1⁄3 innings 
pitched on the strength of his fastball.[4] The Mets added Matz to their 
40-man roster on November 20, 2013, to protect him from being selected 
in the Rule 5 draft.[12] He began the 2014 season with the St. Lucie Mets 
of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, where he had a 4–4 record 
and a 2.21 ERA in 69 1⁄3 innings pitched, before he was promoted to the 
Binghamton Mets of the Class AA Eastern League in 2014.[4] With Binghamton, 
Matz pitched to a 6–5 record with a 2.28 ERA and 69 strikeouts in 71 innings.[13] 
After the season, the Mets named Matz their Organizational Pitcher of the 
Year.[14] Matz opened the 2015 season with the Las Vegas 51s of the Class 
AAA Pacific Coast League.[15] In 15 games started for Las Vegas, Matz had 
a 7–4 record and a 2.19 ERA.[16] The Mets promoted Matz to make his major 
league debut on June 28 against the Cincinnati Reds at Citi Field.[16] 
Matz' first pitch was a wild pitch to Reds' leadoff hitter Brandon Phillips.[17] 
Then on a 3–1 count to Phillips, he hit a home run off the left field fence, 
originally a single, but overturned on video review[18] Matz became the 
second pitcher in Mets history to give up a home run to the first batter 
he faced since Jon Niese on September 2, 2008. Matz won his debut and, 
using a bat given to him by Las Vegas teammate Matt Reynolds,[19] recorded 
four RBIS, breaking the Mets' franchise record for RBIs in a major league 
debut and setting an MLB record for most RBI by a pitcher in their debut.[20] 
He was also the first Mets pitcher with four RBIs in any game since Dwight 
Gooden in 1990. He finished the game with three hits as the Mets went on 
to win, 7–2. Matz described pitching for the team that he grew up supporting 
as "a dream come true."[21] Matz was the first pitcher from Long Island 
to make his MLB debut with the Mets since Ray Searage in 1981.[22] In his 
second start, Matz pitched six scoreless innings while striking out eight 
and allowing two hits. After the game, the Mets announced that Matz tore 
a latissimus dorsi muscle and would miss at least a month recovering.[23] 
Matz returned to the Mets on September 6, starting at Marlins Park against 
Miami, and left the game with a blister and in line for a win, but received 
a no-decision.[24] On September 18, Matz returned to Citi Field, pitching 
the first game of the Subway Series and earning a win. He allowed one run 
on seven hits and a walk in six innings while striking out four batters. 
With that, Matz became the first pitcher in franchise history to allow 
two earned runs or fewer in each of his first five career starts, according 
to the Elias Sports Bureau.[25] Matz finished the season with a 4–0 record 
in six starts with a 2.27 ERA in 35 2⁄3 innings pitched with a WHIP of 
1.234 with 35 strikeouts while giving up 34 hits, 9 runs, 4 home runs, 
and 10 walks. Matz made his postseason debut in Game Four of the 2015 National 
League Division Series in a 3–1 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Matz pitched 
five innings giving up 6 hits, 3 runs, 2 walks, and 4 strikeouts. In Game 
Four of the 2015 National League Championship Series against the Chicago 
Cubs he pitched 4.2 innings giving up 4 hits, 1 run, 2 walks, and 4 strikeouts. 
Matz started game four of the 2015 World Series against the Kansas City 
Royals pitching 5 innings giving up 7 hits, 2 runs, and 5 strikeouts. He 
received a no-decision as the Royals beat the Mets 5–3. Matz made the Mets' 
Opening Day roster in 2016, as the fifth starter in the Mets rotation that 
consisted of Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard, Jacob deGrom, and Bartolo Colon.[26] 
Matz made his first start on Monday Night Baseball against the Miami Marlins, 
but was shelled by Miami, only pitching 1.2 innings, and allowing 7 runs, 
taking the loss. However, after the bad loss, Matz rebounded to finish 
April strong, winning his next three starts in the month. After compiling 
a 4-0 win-loss record, a 1.83 ERA, and 31 strikeouts in May, he was named 
the National League Rookie of the Month.[27] However, after a great May, 
Matz pitched badly over the next two months, not winning a game and seeing 
his ERA ballon from 2.28 to 3.63. On June 28, it was revealed that Matz 
and teammate Noah Syndergaard had pitching most of the season with bone 
spurs in the back of their pitching elbows. It was indicated that Matz's 
spur was more significant and he will need to have it surgically removed. 
However, surgery would require a three-month recovery time, which would 
force Matz to miss the rest of the 2016 Season. Matz decided to wait until 
after the season for surgery to remove the bone spur. After two rough months, 
Matz pitched well in August, striking out 9 in 6 innings against the Arizona 
Diamondbacks on August 9, and then taking a no-hitter into the 8th inning 
in his next start against the San Diego Padres. Matz struck out 8 batters 
in that game, and picked up his ninth win of the season, giving him a 9-8 
win-loss record. The Mets placed Matz on the 15-day disabled list on August 
22, retroactive to August 15, citing "left shoulder tightness". On September 
27, it was announced that Matz would undergo surgery for a bone spur in 
the left elbow, therefore ending his season. Matz received one third place 
vote for the 2016 National League Rookie of the Year, placing him in a 
three-way tie for sixth and last place with Jon Gray and Seung-hwan Oh.[28]
