Baseball began relatively early in Spain thanks to the descendants of immigrants 
from Cuba. They brought the sport along with them when Cuba ceased to be 
a Spanish Colony.[1][2] The heyday of baseball in Spain was in the 1950s 
and 1960s.[3] Owing to mass-interest in football (soccer) many baseball 
clubs didn't survive into the 1970s. The Spanish public's massive shift 
in focus was triggered mainly by the introduction of multiple TV channels 
that focused mainly on broadcasting the soccer matches of "La Liga", the 
professional First Division Spanish League. One of the few survivors was 
the CB Viladecans, whose field was officially used during the 1992 Summer 
Olympics. The Spanish baseball league is divided into divisions. The top 
teams play in the División de Honor. In each division, a team plays all 
other teams twice, once at home and once away, and two matches in the same 
day, during the regular season. There are no playoffs. The top four teams 
at the end of the season play in the Copa del Rey. The champion and the 
cupwinner play in the various European Cup. The Spanish league teams compete 
in Europe under CEB most notably in the Baseball Champions League and CEB 
cup. The Spanish teams also compete in a domestic cup competition each 
year, called the Copa del Rey de Beisbol. Each year, the last qualified 
of División de Honor is relegated to Primera División and the champion 
of Primera is promoted to División de Honor. Also, the ninth qualified 
of Honor and the runner-up of Primera, plays a best-of-five games play-off. 
The winner will play at División de Honor the next season. For a list of
