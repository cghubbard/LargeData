John Joseph Murphy (July 14, 1908 – January 14, 1970) was an All-Star American 
right-handed relief pitcher in Major League Baseball (1932, 1934–43, 1946–47) 
who later became a front office executive in the game. After attending 
Fordham University in his native New York City, Murphy signed a professional 
contract with the New York Yankees. In 1934, his first full season with 
the Yankees, Murphy started 20 games (completing 10); for the remaining 
11 years of his major league career, he would start only 20 games more, 
as he became one of the top bullpen specialists of his day. Moreover, his 
Yankees were one of the most powerful teams of all time, winning consecutive 
World Series championships from 1936 to 1939, and again in 1941 and 1943. 
Murphy's teammates included Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Bill Dickey, Red 
Ruffing, Lefty Gomez—and, through 1934, Babe Ruth. Murphy spent his final 
year in the American League with the 1947 Boston Red Sox, the Yankees' 
arch-rivals. Overall, he appeared in 415 games, winning 93, losing 53 (for 
a winning percentage of .637) with an earned run average of 3.50. He led 
the AL in wins for a relief pitcher seven times. While the save was not 
then an official statistic, Murphy four times led the AL in that category. 
In eight World Series games and 16⅓ innings (spread over six different 
Series), Murphy won two games, lost none, saved four, and posted an ERA 
of 1.10. Johnny Murphy was on 7 World Series winning teams, the most of 
any pitcher in history. When his playing days ended, Murphy stepped immediately 
into the Boston front office when owner Tom Yawkey appointed him Director 
of Minor League Operations. Murphy spent 13 seasons running the Red Sox' 
farm and scouting systems until his dismissal following the 1960 season. 
In 1961, he joined former Yankees farm director and general manager George 
Weiss in the front office of Gotham's National League expansion team, the 
New York Mets. Rising to the position of vice president, Murphy took over 
the general manager responsibilities following the 1967 season when Bing 
Devine returned to his longtime employers, the St. Louis Cardinals. As 
one of his first tasks, Murphy secured the services of manager Gil Hodges, 
under contract to the Washington Senators, by acquiring Hodges in a November 
27, 1967, trade for pitcher Bill Denehy.[1] Murphy's promotion to the GM 
role also coincided with the Mets' unveiling of some of the best young 
pitching talent of the era—including Tom Seaver, Nolan Ryan, Jerry Koosman, 
Tug McGraw, and others. The 1969 Miracle Mets stunned the baseball community 
by winning the NL East, sweeping Atlanta in the NLCS, then defeating a 
heavily favored Baltimore Orioles squad in five World Series games. Not 
quite three months later, Murphy suffered a heart attack and died at age 
61 early on January 14, 1970, in New York City.[2] He was succeeded by 
Bob Scheffing. His older brother Thomas was a federal prosecutor and judge.[3]
