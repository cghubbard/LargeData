Mark Charles Teixeira (/teɪˈʃɛrə/ tay-SHERR-ə; born April 11, 1980) is 
an American former professional baseball first baseman. He spent the last 
eight of his fourteen Major League Baseball (MLB) seasons with the New 
York Yankees. He also played MLB for the Texas Rangers, Atlanta Braves, 
and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Before his professional career, he played 
college baseball at Georgia Tech, where in 2001 he won the Dick Howser 
Trophy as the national collegiate baseball player of the year. One of the 
most prolific switch hitters in MLB history, Teixeira was an integral part 
of the Yankees' 27th World Series championship in 2009, leading the American 
League (AL) in home runs and runs batted in (RBI) while finishing second 
in the Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) balloting. Teixeira was a three-time 
All-Star, won five Gold Glove Awards and three Silver Slugger Awards, and 
also holds the all-time major league record for most games with a home 
run from both sides of the plate, with 14.[1] He was the fifth switch hitter 
in MLB history to reach 400 home runs. Drafted fifth overall by the Texas 
Rangers in 2001, Teixeira made his MLB debut on Opening Day in 2003, and 
hit 26 home runs as a rookie. He hit career-highs of 43 home runs and 144 
RBI in 2005. In four-plus seasons with Texas, he produced a .901 on-base 
plus slugging (OPS), 128 OPS+ and 153 home runs. In mid-2007, he was traded 
to the Braves − which was a crucial point for both clubs as the Braves 
were contending and the Rangers were rebuilding − for Elvis Andrus and 
Matt Harrison. Teixeira was traded again in mid-2008 to the Angels, where 
they lost in the first round of the playoffs. In December 2008, he agreed 
to an eight-year contract with the Yankees, who won a bidding war with 
the Angels and Baltimore Orioles, among other clubs. His most productive 
season for the Yankees was in 2009 in which he was on the team that won 
the World Series over the Philadelphia Phillies. Injuries limited his productivity 
afterward, including early season-ending wrist surgery in 2013, related 
wrist injuries the following year, and necks spasms and torn cartilage 
in 2016. Teixeira retired at the conclusion of his contract with the Yankees, 
following the 2016 playing season.[2] Mark Teixeira grew up in Severna 
Park, Maryland, the son of Margaret "Margy" Canterna and John Teixeira.[3][4] 
He attended Mount Saint Joseph High School in Baltimore, Maryland, where 
he played for the school's varsity baseball team. His paternal grandfather 
emigrated from the South American country Guyana, and he has English and 
Portuguese ancestry through his father.[5] Teixeira's mother is of Italian 
descent.[6][7][8][9] Teixeira was originally chosen in the ninth round 
of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft by the Boston Red Sox. Teixeira 
chose not to sign with the Red Sox, however, opting instead to play college 
baseball for Georgia Tech citing that he didn't appreciate how the Red 
Sox treated him.[10] In the summer of 1999, he played for the Orleans Cardinals 
and won the Outstanding Pro Prospect Award in the Cape Cod Baseball League. 
Teixeira played college baseball at Georgia Tech. In 2000, his batting 
average was .427, and his on-base plus slugging (OPS) was 1.319. He also 
won the Dick Howser Trophy as the national collegiate baseball player of 
the year.[11] He roomed with UCF assistant head coach & offensive coordinator 
Brent Key.[12] In 2001, Teixeira re-entered the draft and was selected 
by the Texas Rangers with the fifth overall pick. The Philadelphia Phillies 
considered selecting him with the fourth overall pick, but the demands 
of Teixeira's agent Scott Boras swayed the Phillies to select Gavin Floyd. 
The Rangers signed Teixeira to a Major League contract worth $9.5 million 
over 4 years. Teixeira began the 2002 season in the Florida State League, 
where he batted .320 with an OPS of 1.000 in 38 games. He was then moved 
up to the Double-A Tulsa Drillers, with whom he batted .316 with a .994 
OPS and hit 10 home runs in 48 games. It turned out that 2002 would be 
his only season in the minor leagues; he made the Rangers out of spring 
training in 2003. As a rookie in 2003, Teixeira hit .259 with 26 home runs, 
84 RBI, and a .811 OPS. Teixeira began to improve in 2004, batting .281 
with an OPS of .930, 38 home runs, and 112 RBI. On August 17, 2004, Teixeira 
hit for the cycle. For his accomplishments in 2005, he earned the Silver 
Slugger Award as the best-hitting first baseman in the American League 
as well as the Gold Glove signifying his place as the best fielding first 
baseman in the American League. He was also named to his first All-Star 
Game after winning the fan voting portion of the selection to be named 
the starting first baseman for his league. During the game, Teixeira hit 
a home run from the right hand side of the plate, something he had failed 
to do in the entire first half of the season. In a five-game span around 
the All-Star Game, Teixeira hit five home runs with 13 RBI. He finished 
July with 13 home runs and 30 RBI and was named the American League Player 
of the Month. Overall, Teixeira batted .301 with 43 home runs and 144 RBI 
in the 2005 season. In 2005, Teixeira became the third switch-hitter in 
MLB history to hit at least 20 home runs in each of his first three seasons, 
after Eddie Murray and Chipper Jones. He is also one of just five players 
in Major League history to hit at least 100 home runs in his first three 
seasons, joining Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio, Ralph Kiner, and Eddie Mathews 
as well as current first base star, Albert Pujols. Other players – Mark 
McGwire, José Canseco, Todd Helton, Ryan Howard – have hit 100+ home runs 
in their first three full seasons, but these players had all played partial 
seasons prior to playing their first three full seasons. His 2005 total 
of 144 RBI is a Major League record for a switch-hitter.[13] On Mother's 
Day, May 14, 2006, Teixeira was one of more than 50 hitters who brandished 
a pink bat to benefit the Breast Cancer Foundation. Teixeira's 2006 season 
began slowly, as he collected only nine home runs before the All-Star Break. 
After the All-Star Break, however, he was among the league's leaders in 
home runs, and again finished with over 30 homers and 100 RBI for the season. 
Teixeira agreed to a two-year $15.98 million contract before the 2006 season 
to avoid his first two years of arbitration.[14] On June 9, 2007, Teixeira's 
franchise record 507 consecutive-game streak came to an end. Teixeira landed 
awkwardly at first base after running out a grounder in a game against 
the Milwaukee Brewers the previous day. The streak was second to Miguel 
Tejada at the time. The strained quadriceps muscle placed Teixeira on the 
disabled list for only the second time of his career. In July 2007, two 
weeks after turning down an eight-year, $140 million contract extension 
from the Rangers, Teixeira was traded to the Atlanta Braves (along with 
left-handed reliever Ron Mahay) for catcher/first baseman Jarrod Saltalamacchia, 
and four prospects: shortstop Elvis Andrus, and starting pitchers Matt 
Harrison, Neftalí Feliz and Beau Jones.[15] Teixeira was activated for 
that night's game against the Houston Astros and arrived in the dugout 
during the seventh inning. He was promptly shown on Turner Field's high 
definition video board and received a boisterous applause from the Atlanta 
crowd. In his Braves debut on August 1, 2007, Teixeira hit a 3-run homer 
and drove in 4 runs in a 12–3 rout of the Houston Astros.[16] Teixeira 
went on to homer in each of the following two games, becoming just the 
second player to homer in his first three games as a Brave – the first 
being Gary Sheffield in 2002. On August 19, 2007, Teixeira had his first 
multi-HR game against the Arizona Diamondbacks off Yusmeiro Petit. He would 
repeat that feat the next day, going deep for two three-run home runs versus 
the Cincinnati Reds. Teixeira, a switch-hitter, hit both homers on the 
19th batting from the left side of the plate, and hit his homers on the 
20th from the right side. He was named co-NL Player of the Week from August 
20–26 by slugging .793 with three home runs and as expected, he was awarded 
NL Player of the Month for August. On September 22, Teixeira had his first 
walk-off hit with the Braves when he singled in Willie Harris giving the 
Braves a 4–3 extra-inning victory.[17] In 54 games with Atlanta in 2007, 
Teixeira batted .317 with 17 home runs and 56 RBI. The Braves avoided arbitration 
in the 2007 offseason and signed Teixeira to a one-year, $12.5 million 
contract for the 2008 season.[18] In July 2008, Teixeira was traded to 
the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for Casey Kotchman and minor league pitcher 
Stephen Marek.[19] Batting third in the Angel order, Teixeira hit .358 
with 13 home runs and 43 RBIs after the trade to help his new team to their 
first 100-win season in franchise history. Through 2011, he was one of 
seven major leaguers to have had at least four 30-homer, 100-RBI seasons 
in their first five years, along with Chuck Klein, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, 
Ralph Kiner, Albert Pujols, and Ryan Braun.[20] Teixeira made his postseason 
debut with a .467 batting average, 7 hits and an RBI. His new team of the 
Angels would lose the 2008 ALDS to the Boston Red Sox in 4 games. Teixeira 
declared for free agency at the end of the season. In December 2008, Teixeira 
agreed preliminarily to a deal with the New York Yankees worth $180 million 
over 8 years, and he was formally introduced as a Yankee on January 6, 
2009. The contract included a full no-trade clause, plus a $5 million signing 
bonus. He signed with the Yankees over a number of other clubs, including 
the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Boston Red Sox, Washington Nationals 
and Baltimore Orioles. The signing with the Yankees reunited Teixeira with 
teammate Alex Rodriguez who played for the Texas Rangers from 2000-2003. 
Teixeira wears number 25 instead of his preferred number 23, since 23 is 
retired in honor of Don Mattingly. Mattingly was Teixeira's childhood idol, 
and was the reason Teixeira wore 23 earlier in his career.[21][22][23] 
In the 2009 season, he led the AL in both home runs (tied with Carlos Peña 
of Tampa Bay) with 39, and RBI with 122. Teixeira received a World Series 
ring as the Yankees won the 2009 World Series, but struggled offensively 
throughout the postseason, batting only .180 overall and .136 in the World 
Series. However, several of his hits proved very important, including a 
walk-off home run in Game 2 of the ALDS and a game-tying home run in Game 
2 of the World Series. Additionally, he made several stellar defensive 
plays in all rounds of the playoffs.[24] For the 2009 season, Teixeira 
was awarded both the Gold Glove and Silver Slugger awards for the American 
League first baseman. He also finished second in the AL MVP balloting behind 
Twins' catcher Joe Mauer. On May 8, 2010, he became the second Yankees 
player to hit three home runs in one game against the Boston Red Sox, joining 
Lou Gehrig, who accomplished the feat on June 23, 1927.[25] Once again, 
Teixeira won the 2010 Gold Glove Award for American League first basemen. 
Teixeira never fully recovered from his slow start in April and May, hitting 
a then career-low .256, but still managed to hit 33 home runs and 108 runs 
batted in for the 2010 season.[26] On June 30, 2011, Teixeira hit his 300th 
career home run.[27] On August 2, 2011, Teixeira hit a home run from both 
sides of the plate in the same game for the 12th time in his career, breaking 
a three-way tie with Chili Davis and Eddie Murray for the most such games 
all-time.[28] In August 2011, Teixeira and Curtis Granderson became the 
first Yankees teammates to have 30 home runs in 115 games since Roger Maris 
and Mickey Mantle in 1961.[29] Through 2011, he had the third-best career 
fielding percentage among major league first basemen (.996), behind Casey 
Kotchman and Kevin Youkilis.[30] During the 2011 year, Teixeira batted 
.248 with 39 home runs and 111 RBI. Teixeira continued his postseason struggles 
in 2011 as he batted only .167 with 1 RBI in a 5-game ALDS loss to the 
Detroit Tigers. On March 1, 2012, Teixeira hired Casey Close of Excel Sports 
Management to be his agent. This came almost a year after Teixeira parted 
ways with Boras. Close also represents fellow Yankees Derek Jeter and Masahiro 
Tanaka, as well as Ryan Howard.[31] Throughout the 2012 season, Teixeira 
was plagued with several health issues and injuries such as a "persistent 
and almost debilitating" cough caused by severe congestion of the bronchi,[32] 
wrist inflammation, and a calf strain. Teixeira spent some time on the 
disabled list with the calf strain from late August until early September. 
After committing a disputed double play in a 4-5 loss against the Orioles,[33] 
Teixeira aggravated his calf and was put on the DL again.[34] He would 
eventually return for the season finale against the Red Sox. He finished 
the 2012 season with a .251 batting average, 24 home runs, and 84 RBI in 
123 games played. Following the season, Teixeira won the 2012 Gold Glove 
Award for American League first basemen. He won a Fielding Bible Award 
as the best fielding first baseman in MLB.[35] He named the Yankees' nominee 
for the 2012 Roberto Clemente Award.[36] On March 6, 2013, Teixeira suffered 
a strained wrist tendon while he was part of Team USA of the World Baseball 
Classic.[37] Teixeira began the 2013 season on the 15-day disabled list 
and was transferred to the 60-day disabled list on May 14. He returned 
on May 31, 2013, against the Red Sox going 0−3 with a walk and scoring 
a run. He aggravated the wrist on June 15, 2013 and the next day, he received 
cortisone injections to treat the inflammation of the wrist. He was again 
placed on the 15-day DL due to the inflammation on June 18, 2013. Teixeira 
played in only 15 games during the 2013 season with a .151 average, 3 home 
runs, and 12 RBI. On July 1, 2013, Teixeira underwent wrist surgery and 
was shut down for the rest of the season.[38] During a game against the 
Toronto Blue Jays on April 4, 2014, Teixeira left the game after a hamstring 
injury while trying to fetch a foul ball in foul territory.[39] He was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list the following day on April 5, 2014.[40] 
He was activated on April 20, 2014. During a game against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates on May 17, 2014, Teixeira hit his 350th career home run off of 
Edinson Vólquez.[41] On May 31, 2014, Teixeira aggravated his wrist that 
was surgically repaired the previous year. He received a cortisone shot 
to treat the wrist and missed two games. During a game against the Orioles 
on June 22, 2014, Teixeira left the game after being hit in the toe of 
the left foot by a pitch from T. J. McFarland.[42] X-rays came back negative 
on the toe injury.[43] On September 4, 2014, Teixeira hit his 21st home 
run of the season, which was a game-tying, solo home run that paved the 
way for a walk-off 5-4 victory over the Red Sox. In 2014, Teixeira batted 
only .216 but still hit 22 home runs with 62 RBI limited to 123 games. 
During a game against the Minnesota Twins on August 17, 2015, Teixeira 
fouled a ball off his leg and left the game. X-Rays were negative, but 
it was projected that he had a deep bone bruise in his leg. Listed as day-to-day, 
Teixeira missed nearly two weeks and was sent back to New York on August 
31, 2015 to visit Yankees head team physician, Dr. Christopher Ahmad to 
seek second opinions. On September 1, Teixeira underwent CAT scans, x-rays, 
and MRIs, all testing negative. On September 4, Teixeira was placed on 
the 15-day disabled list due to the nagging bone bruise.[44] On September 
11, Teixeira underwent further tests and an MRI revealed a fracture in 
his shin, which eventually ended his 2015 season. The injury required three 
months to recover.[45] In 111 games of 2015, Teixeira batted .255 with 
31 home runs and 79 RBI. On May 10, 2016, Teixeira revealed that he had 
been battling neck spasms.[46] On May 25, he underwent an MRI on his neck, 
which was negative.[47] The next day, he received a cortisone shot to treat 
the pain in his neck.[48] In a game against the Orioles on June 3, he left 
the game due to right knee discomfort. He underwent an MRI the next day, 
which revealed that there was torn articular cartilage, placing him on 
the 15-day disabled list.[49][50][51] Hoping to avoid surgery, Teixeira 
opted for treatment and rehabilitation on June 8.[52][53][54][55] He was 
activated on June 25. While playing the San Diego Padres on July 3, Teixeira 
hit two home runs, including his 400th career home run. He became only 
the fifth switch-hitter to hit 400 home runs in a career.[56] He followed 
teammate and fellow switch-hitter Carlos Beltrán, who had also hit his 
400th career home run for the Yankees less than two months earlier on May 
15.[57] Another former teammate who also accomplished this feat was Chipper 
Jones, with whom Teixeira briefly played as a member of the Atlanta Braves.[58] 
On August 5, Teixiera held a press conference in which he announced his 
intent to retire at the end of the season, citing his family life and the 
year's injuries.[59] On September 28, Teixeira hit the final home run of 
his career, which was a walk-off grand slam off Boston Red Sox pitcher 
Joe Kelly. It was the first game-ending home run Teixeira had ever hit 
in a regular-season game.[60] On September 30, prior to a game against 
the Orioles, Teixeira was honored by the rock band, Twisted Sister during 
a pregame ceremony. The band gifted Teixeira an Epiphone Les Paul guitar 
with signatures from everyone in the band. The song, "I Wanna Rock" was 
used as Teixeira's walk-up song since he first joined the Yankees.[61] 
October 2 was Teixeira's final game of his career. Prior to the game, another 
pregame ceremony took place with his wife and three children visiting. 
He received several gifts, including a framed jersey and an autographed 
base. He finished the game 0 for 3 and left the game in the 7th inning 
as the Yankees lost 2-5 to the Orioles.[62][63] In 116 games of his final 
season in the majors, Teixeira batted .204 with 15 home runs and 44 RBI.[64] 
Teixeira endorsed Marco Rubio in his campaign to be elected President of 
the United States in 2016.[65] In August 2011, Teixeira made a cameo appearance 
during the eighth and final season of the HBO TV series Entourage along 
with teammate Alex Rodriguez. Eduardo Núñez is also seen in the cameo. 
Teixeira made his Broadway debut in a one-night cameo in the jukebox musical 
Rock of Ages on January 29, 2013. He played the role of Mark, a bartender 
at the fictional Bourbon Room.[66] A self-described avid film buff, Teixeira 
is a member of the board of the Greenwich International Film Festival.[67] 
During 2014 spring training, Teixeira filmed in Foul Territory, a parody 
interview show aired by the YES Network. He came up with the idea as a 
way to help the Yankees' new free agent signings to the team. The show 
has been described as similar in style to The Chris Farley Show and Between 
Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis.[68][69] It was announced as a New York 
Emmy Award nominee on February 11, 2015.[70] After signing his first major 
league contract, Teixeira set up a scholarship at his high school in honor 
of a friend who was killed in a car accident.[71] Teixeira and his family 
reside in Greenwich, Connecticut.[72] In 2006, Teixeira and his wife Leigh 
Williams, whom he met at Georgia Tech, established the Mark Teixeira Charitable 
Fund that supported six scholarships at three high schools in the Dallas–Fort 
Worth area. They have three children, sons Jack Gordan and William Charles, 
and daughter Addison Leigh.[73] His hobbies include hunting, golfing, reading, 
and fishing.[74] He also enjoys Broadway theatre and identifies Les Misérables 
as his favorite production.[75] Teixeira is a devout Catholic and credits 
much his success to his father's guidance and to the insight that the death 
of a friend in high school provided. There is also a video on YouTube in
