Texas A&M Aggies (variously A&M or Texas Aggies) refers to the students, 
graduates, and sports teams of Texas A&M University. The nickname "Aggie" 
was once common at land-grant or "Ag" (agriculture) schools in many states. 
The teams compete in Division I of NCAA sports. Texas A&M was a charter 
member of the Southwest Conference until its dissolution and subsequent 
formation of the Big 12 Conference in 1996. The Aggies competed in the 
Big 12 until joining the Southeastern Conference (SEC) on July 1, 2012. 
Texas A&M's official school colors are maroon and white. The teams are 
referred to as Aggies and the mascot is a Rough Collie named Reveille. 
Texas A&M competes in the following varsity sports: Men's sports Women's 
sports The Texas A&M Aggies have earned three national titles (1919, 1927 
and 1939), 20 conference titles and two Heisman trophies won by John David 
Crow in 1957 and Johnny Manziel, the first freshman to ever win the award, 
in 2012.[2] A&M has had two perfect seasons having gone undefeated and 
unscored upon in both 1917[3] and 1919.[4] The football program experienced 
a period of little success lasting from 1944 to 1971, when the Aggies won 
only two conference titles. With Emory Bellard as head coach beginning 
in 1972, the Aggies returned to prominence with two 10 win seasons during 
his short tenure. He was replaced by Tom Wilson who had little success 
at Texas A&M before Jackie Sherrill took over the program. Sherrill won 
three consecutive conference titles and two Cotton Bowl Classic postseason 
games. His defensive coordinator, R. C. Slocum, replaced him as head coach 
in 1989. Slocum finished in the top 25 during 10 of his 14 years at Texas 
A&M[5] and won 4 conference titles, including the school's only Big 12 
title in 1998. In late 2002, Dennis Franchione left his position as head 
coach at the University of Alabama to take over Texas A&M's football program 
from Slocum. He finished the 2003 season at 4-8. Franchione finished the 
2004 regular season with a 7-4 mark and an invitation to the Cotton Bowl 
Classic, a game the Aggies lost to Tennessee. The 2005 team regressed to 
5-6 and defensive coordinator Carl Torbush was fired, and replaced by Gary 
Darnell. Due to the much-needed improvements on defense, the Aggies finished 
the 2006 regular season with a 9-3 record and a 5-3 mark in Big 12 play, 
including a 12-7 victory over the Texas Longhorns in Austin, the first 
over the Longhorns in 6 years. In the 2007 season, the Aggies finished 
in a three way tie for third place with Texas Tech and Oklahoma State in 
the Big 12 South, leading only Baylor, which finished last. Although the 
team pulled out a 38-30 victory over the Longhorns on the day after Thanksgiving, 
coach Dennis Franchione was forced to retire. Former Green Bay Packers 
coach Mike Sherman was announced as his replacement three days later. Unfortunately, 
Sherman's first year at A&M resulted in one of the worst records in years, 
finishing at 4-8.[6] The 2009 season showed some improvement with a 5-2 
home record and a 6-7 overall record.[7] More coaching changes were made 
after the 2009 season and the hiring of Tim DeRuyter lead the media coverage. 
In 2008, DeRuyter was the defensive coordinator and safeties coach at Airforce 
where his defense finished 11th in the NCAA in total defense, and 5th in 
pass defense.[8] The Aggie Football team was featured in the ESPN movie, 
The Junction Boys. The film dramatized Coach Paul "Bear" Bryant's grueling 
football practice sessions in 1954 in Junction, Texas.[9] Texas A&M basketball 
had been dormant for much of its recent history until the mid-2000s. The 
Aggies have won 11 conference championships, two conference tournament 
titles, and have 10 NCAA tournament appearances. Under former head coach 
Billy Gillispie, the Aggies finished fourth in conference in 2006 only 
two years removed from having zero wins in conference play. Gillispie then 
led the Aggies to their first NCAA tournament berth since 1987, playing 
as a 12 seed, and to A&M's first NCAA tournament win since 1980 over fifth 
seed Syracuse. The Aggies were one point short of advancing to the Sweet 
Sixteen over fourth seed LSU, with a final score of 57-58. In the 2007 
season, A&M spent most of the season ranked in the top 10 of the polls 
and became the first Big 12 south team to win against the University of 
Kansas in Lawrence since the Big 12 was formed. The Aggies finished with 
a 27-7 record and finished 2nd in the Big 12. They earned a number 3 seed 
in the NCAA tournament where they made it to the sweet 16, but fell to 
the University of Memphis 64-65. Acie Law IV was named an All-American. 
Billy Gillispie left for the University of Kentucky soon after the season. 
Mark Turgeon was named head coach a few days later, and has amassed a 73-31 
record in his first three years in College Station, along with three more 
NCAA tournament appearances and a 3-3 NCAA tournament record. The women's 
basketball team had two NCAA tournament appearances, an NWIT title, and 
a Southwest Conference tournament title before entering the Big 12. The 
program experienced little success in the new conference until current 
head coach Gary Blair took over the program. Blair's teams advanced to 
the NCAA tournament multiple times. He led the 2011 team to the NCAA national 
championship. Ground broke on the Cox-McFerrin Center in November 2006, 
a 68,000-square-foot (6,300 m2) expansion to Reed Arena which includes 
new locker rooms, meeting rooms, practice gyms, training rooms, player 
lounges, and reception areas. The Aggie baseball team plays home games 
at Olsen Field, which went through major renovations and is now Olsen Field 
at Blue Bell Park. The team is coached by Rob Childress, who joined the 
program in the 2006 season, after leaving his assistant coach position 
with the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Since conference play began in 1915, the 
Aggies have won 15 Southwest Conference titles, three Big 12 regular-season 
and two tournament titles, and have made five College World Series appearances. 
1989 was the high-water mark when the Aggies were ranking #1 for numerous 
weeks before ending the season ranked #2. The softball team formed in the 
1972–73 season. The team won NCAA championships in both 1983 and 1987,[10] 
and an AIAW championship in 1982. It also has eleven College World Series 
appearances.[11] The team is coached by Jo Evans, who has led the program 
since 1996. Under her leadership, the Aggies have won two conference regular 
season championships (2005 and 2008), one conference tournament championship 
(2008), appeared in the NCAA Regionals nine times, winning two, and the 
Super Regionals thrice, winning two. They have also made two Women's College 
World Series appearances under her coaching and finished 7th in 2007 and 
2nd in 2008.[12] Women's soccer is coached by G. Guerreri, who has led 
the program since its inception in 1993. His Aggies have won 12 Big 12 
titles (7 regular season and 5 tournament), including 4 straight regular 
season titles from 2004-2007. The Aggies have made 17 consecutive appearances 
in the NCAA Tournament since 1995. Of those 17, 4 are Elite 8 finishes, 
and 6 are Sweet 16 finishes. Since 1999, the Aggies have advanced at least 
as far as the Sweet 16 during all but four of their NCAA Tournament appearances. 
The Aggies have never been eliminated in the round of 64.[13] The Aggie 
volleyball team is coached by Laurie Corbelli, who has been at Texas A&M 
since 1993. The Texas A&M volleyball team participated in 13 consecutive 
NCAA postseasons, from Corbelli's first year in 1993 to 2005, reaching 
the Elite Eight twice and Sweet Sixteen three times. After several lean 
years, the Aggies returned to the NCAA tournament, advancing to the Sweet 
16 in 2010 and the second round in 2011. Track and field is coached by 
Pat Henry. In his 17 years at LSU, Henry won 27 national titles, 17 SEC 
titles, 15 SEC Coach of the Year awards, and five National Coach of the 
Year awards. Henry was hired by Texas A&M before the 2005 season, taking 
over a program that had never won a title in women's track. Within three 
years, in 2007, his teams won both women's indoor and outdoor Big 12 Conference 
titles. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, he won both the men's and women's NCAA 
outdoor titles, a feat he has accomplished four times and duplicated by 
no other coach.[14] Since arriving in College Station, Henry has won two 
National Coach of the Year and six Big 12 Coach of the Year awards. Men's 
golf is coached by J.T. Higgins, who has been with the program since 2001. 
He has led the team to three top 15 finishes at the NCAA tournament. His 
2009 team captured the NCAA title. They have won 11 conference championships: 
Women's golf has been coached by Trelle McCombs since the summer of 2007 
making 2007–08 her first year as head coach. The golf team won the Big 
12 title in 1998, 2006, 2007, and 2010. In 2006, the team finished 19th 
at the NCAA Championship tournament. In 2008, the team was fifth in their 
regional advancing to the NCCA Championship tournament. In 2011, the team 
finished 7th at the NCAA Championships, which they hosted at the Traditions 
Championship Golf Course. In its third annual College Golf Guide, Golf 
Digest ranked both the men's and women's golf programs among the best in 
the nation in the team's scoring average, player growth, academics, climate, 
and facilities/coaches. The men's program ranked as the best in the Big 
12 Conference and No. 15 nationally. The women's program ranked as the 
second best in the Big 12 Conference and No. 20 nationally.[15] Men's tennis 
debuted in 1978. Richard Barker coached the inaugural season, compiling 
a 9–12 record. David Kent took over in 1979, and coached until 1996. Under 
Kent, the Aggies made two NCAA Tournament appearances in 1985 and 1994, 
finishing in the First Round in both. The Aggies also appeared in the NCAA 
Region IV Championships from 1994–96, winning the 1994 championship. Tim 
Cass replaced Kent in 1997, coaching until 2006. In Cass's ten seasons 
at A&M, he won three Big 12 tournament titles and one conference title. 
He resigned in July 2006 to accept a position as senior associate athletic 
director at the University of New Mexico, his alma mater. In 2006, former 
ATP Tour player and Texas A&M–Corpus Christi head coach Steve Denton was 
named the new head men's tennis coach. Former Trinity University coach 
Bob McKinley became his assistant. Denton won three Southland Conference 
regular-season titles, two tournament titles, and had an overall conference 
record of 19-2, including two undefeated regular seasons, in his five years 
with the Islanders. In 2008, he was inducted into the Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association Hall of Fame, joining former A&M coach David Kent, who was 
inducted in 1998, and McKinley, who was inducted in 2003. With both of 
the coaching staff in the ITA Hall of Fame, the A&M men's tennis program 
is the only program in the country with two ITA Hall of Fame coaches.[16] 
In 2011, the No. 3 seeded Texas A&M Men's Doubles team of Jeff Dadamo and 
Austin Krajicek defeated the No. 4 seeded Stanford University Men's Doubles 
team of Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher for the NCAA Men's Doubles Crown. 
The women's tennis program started in 1980. The women's team has been coached 
by Bobby Kleinecke since 1985. In 2003 and 2004, he was voted Big 12 Coach 
of the Year. Kleinecke led the Aggies to two conference titles in 1986 
and 2003 and a tournament title in 2004. The Aggies have also made a total 
of 13 NCAA Tournament appearances under Kleinecke.[17] In 2011, Howard 
Joffe, previously at Maryland, was named head coach after Kleinecke's contract 
was not renewed.[18] Both the men's and women's swimming and diving teams 
compete in the Student Rec Center Natatorium. Long-time assistant Jay Holmes, 
who has worked at Texas A&M since 1987, became the head coach of the men's 
swimming program in 2004. Women's swimming is led by Steve Bultman, who 
has been the head coach since 1999. The diving program is led by Jay Lerew. 
The Texas A&M women's swimming program has several notable current and 
former swimmers. This includes 2008 Summer Olympics medalist Christine 
Marshall, who swam for the US, 2012 Summer Olympics gold medalist Breeja 
Larson and Olympian Cammile Adams, both who also swam for the US, Triin 
Aljand, who swam for Estonia, Alia Atkinson, who swam for Jamaica, and 
Julia Wilkinson, who swam for Canada. Team members Kristen Heiss and Emily 
Neal are members of the US National Team and competed in the 2009 Summer 
World University Games .[19] The women's program has won four of the last 
six Big 12 Swimming and Diving Championships, including in 2012. They finished 
tenth in the 2011 NCAA championships. The men finished 13th, cracking the 
top 25 for the fifteenth consecutive year. Coached by Tana Rawson, the 
women's equestrian team has been a varsity sport at Texas A&M since 1999. 
Although a group of administrators and coaches are working to make equestrian 
an NCAA-recognized sport,[20] A&M competes with 18 other equestrian teams 
from Division I schools.[21] For seven years, from 2000 to 2006, the program 
participated in the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association National Championship, 
winning the Western division national title three times. The program now 
competes only in the Varsity Equestrian National Championship, in which 
A&M won the overall national championship in 2002 and Western division 
titles in 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2010. Additionally, in 2010, Texas A&M 
won two individual national titles, with Caroline Gunn winning the national 
title for the second time in a row in Horsemanship, and Maggie Gratny winning 
the national title in reining. Texas A&M won the inaugural Big 12 Classic 
in 2007, a competition between Big 12 programs with equestrian teams, which 
includes Baylor, Kansas State, and Oklahoma State. Founded in 1968, Texas 
A&M Rugby plays in Division 1-A in the Allied Rugby Conference against 
traditional rivals such as Texas, Texas Tech, and Oklahoma.[22][23] The 
Aggies are led by Head Coach Clayton Hayes.[24] Texas A&M offers scholarships 
to in-state and out-of-state rugby players, and qualifying out-of-state 
rugby players may attend Texas A&M at the in-state tuition rate.[25] Texas 
A&M finished the 2011-12 season ranked 16th in the country.[26] The Aggies 
won the 2012 Allied Rugby Conference 7s tournament, racking up wins against 
Oklahoma and Texas Tech along the way.[27] The Aggies also won the 2012 
Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Conference 7s, defeating Georgia in the final 
28-10. This victory qualified the Aggies for the 2012 USA Rugby Sevens 
Collegiate National Championships,[28] where they reached the quarterfinals. 
In the 2012-13 season, Texas A&M defeated Texas to win the Allied Rugby 
Conference.[29] Texas A&M has a total of 25 team national championships, 
of which 12 were bestowed by the NCAA. The first two NCAA titles were won 
by the softball team in 1983 and 1987, while the third was won by the men's 
golf team in 2009. The fourth and fifth were won in 2009 by the men's and 
women's outdoor track teams, when the Aggies garnered double national titles. 
The men's and women's track teams also added the sixth and seventh titles 
in 2010, repeating the same title feat.[30] Both teams added yet another 
two in 2011. The women's basketball team won in 2011. The men's outdoor 
track and field team won the Aggies' eleventh national title at the 2013 
NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championship in its first year of SEC competition. 
The twelfth NCAA title was won by the women's outdoor track and field team 
in 2014. The softball team won the 1982 AIAW Women's College World Series, 
the last softball championship to be conducted by the AIAW, which governed 
women's intercollegiate athletics from 1972 to mid-1982 (the NCAA began 
sponsoring women's athletics in 1981). The 1939 football team was designated 
national champions by multiple selectors, including the Associated Press, 
the Helms Athletic Foundation, the National Championship Foundation, and 
the College Football Researchers Association.[31] In addition to the 1939 
national title, in 2011 the football program laid claim to national titles 
for 1919 and 1927, each of which was chosen once to appear in different 
retroactive listings by two selectors in the 1970s. The equestrian team 
won the Varsity Equestrian overall national championship in 2002 and 2012, 
while winning the western-riding style component of that competition in 
2005, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.[32] The team additionally won the 
Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA) western-style championship 
in 2002, 2003 and 2004.[33] Before it attained varsity status in 1999, 
the team had also won this title in 1994. Texas A&M has won 12 NCAA team 
national championships.[34] Listed below are six national team titles in 
current and emerging NCAA sports that were not bestowed by the NCAA. Below 
are 132 national team titles won by Texas A&M varsity and club sports teams 
at the highest collegiate levels in non-NCAA sports: Texas A&M has won 
a total of 167 team conference and tournament championships. 96 titles 
were won during play in the Southwest Conference (93 men's/3 women's) while 
58 were won in Big 12 Conference play (19 men's/39 women's). Texas A&M 
has won 13 titles in the Southeastern Conference (5 men's/8 women's) with 
the 2016 Baseball tournament title being the most recent. Women's Volleyball 
is the only program in Texas A&M sports history to have never won a conference 
title. SWC = Southwest Conference   •   B12 = Big 12 Conference   •   SEC 
= Southeast Conference The NACDA Director's Cup is an award given annually 
by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics to the 
colleges and universities with the most success in collegiate athletics. 
Points for the NACDA Director's Cup are based on order of finish in various 
NCAA sponsored championships or in the case of Division I Football media 
base polls. The award originated in 1993, and was presented to NCAA Division 
I schools only. In 1995, it was extended to Division II, Division III, 
and NAIA schools as well, each division receiving its own award. Texas 
A&M's yearly final standings among other Division I schools since the cup 
originated in 1993 are as follows:[61][62] Texas A&M has two active, long-time 
rivals, the LSU Tigers and the Arkansas Razorbacks. After playing LSU sporadically 
throughout the 20th Century, the LSU–Texas A&M Rivalry is the Aggies' seventh 
oldest, with the series dating back to 1899. Since Texas A&M joined the 
SEC in 2012, fans anticipate LSU to become Texas A&M's primary rival. Texas 
A&M and Arkansas share a rich history, since both were members of the Southwest 
Conference, first playing each other in football in 1903. When Arkansas 
left the SWC in 1991, this rivalry was put on eighteen-year hiatus until 
the rivalry was reborn with the formation of the Southwest Classic in 2009. 
Texas A&M's traditional rival was the Texas Longhorns. The university has 
had other significant rivals, but few came close to the rivalry shared 
between Texas A&M and the University of Texas. The mutual respect and desire 
to win gave rise to the Lone Star Showdown, an athletic competition that 
lasted year-round and encompassed all regular-season NCAA athletic events 
between the two schools. Though the showdown officially began in 2004, 
the two teams had been competing with one another for more than a century. 
The rivalry ended in 2012 when the Aggies moved to the Southeastern Conference. 
Other historical rivalries that are partially or no longer active include 
those from its membership in the Southwest Conference (Baylor, Texas Tech, 
Rice, Houston, SMU, and TCU). Texas A&M also competed against Texas, Baylor 
and Texas Tech in the Big 12 Conference. Athletic venues and facilities 
include: Football: Kyle Field Basketball: Reed Arena Baseball: Olsen Field 
Softball: Aggie Softball Complex Volleyball: Reed Arena Soccer: Ellis Field 
Golf: Traditions Club Championship Golf Course Tennis: George P. Mitchell
