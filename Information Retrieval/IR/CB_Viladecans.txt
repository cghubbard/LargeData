Home Away Club Béisbol Viladecans is a División de Honor de Béisbol baseball 
club in Viladecans, a town located to the WSW of Barcelona, Catalonia. 
It was founded in 1945 and was one of the most active teams during the 
heyday of baseball in Spain in the 1950s and 1960s. Club Beisbol Viladecans 
was one of the few teams that survived the difficult times of the late 
1960s and 1970s, when mass-interest in football (soccer) compromised the 
viability of other local baseball clubs. The field of the Club Beisbol 
Viladecans was officially used during the 1992 Summer Olympics for baseball.[1]
