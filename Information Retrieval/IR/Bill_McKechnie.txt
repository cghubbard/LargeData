As Player As Manager William Boyd McKechnie (August 7, 1886 – October 29, 
1965) was an American professional baseball player, manager and coach. 
He played in Major League Baseball as a third baseman during the dead-ball 
era. McKechnie was the first manager to win World Series titles with two 
different teams (1925 Pittsburgh Pirates and 1940 Cincinnati Reds), and 
remains one of only two managers to win pennants with three teams, also 
capturing the National League title in 1928 with the St. Louis Cardinals. 
His 1,892 career victories ranked fourth in major league history when he 
ended his managing career in 1946, and trailed only John McGraw's NL total 
of 2,669 in league history. He was nicknamed "Deacon" because he sang in 
his church choir and generally lived a quiet life. McKechnie was born on 
August 7, 1886 to Archibald and Mary McKechnie, two Scottish immigrants 
who had settled in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania shortly before Bill was born.[1] 
McKechnie made his major league debut in 1907 with the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
appearing in three games, before reemerging with the team in 1910 in a 
more substantial role. A utility infielder for the first half of his career 
before playing more substantially at third base later on, McKechnie played 
with the Pirates (1907, 1910–12, 1918, 1920), Boston Braves (1913), New 
York Yankees (1913), Indianapolis Hoosiers/Newark Peppers (1914–15), New 
York Giants (1916) and Cincinnati Reds (1916–17). His best offensive season 
came in 1914 with the Hoosiers, when scored 107 runs, batted .304 and stole 
47 bases. In 1913, McKechnie had his worst season as a full-time player, 
batting only .134. However, Yankees manager Frank Chance thought McKechnie 
had a keen baseball mind, and had him sit next to him on the bench during 
games.[2] Two years later, McKechnie got his first taste of managerial 
duties, when he served as player-manager of the Newark Peppers of the Federal 
League, leading the team to a 54–45 record.[3] After he retired as a player, 
he managed for a year in the minors before assuming the helm of the Pirates 
in 1922. He managed the Pirates from 1922 to 1926, St. Louis Cardinals 
in 1928, St. Louis Cardinals again after they rehired him in 1929, Boston 
Braves from 1930 to 1937, and Cincinnati Reds from 1938 to 1946. He compiled 
1,896 wins and 1,723 losses for a .524 winning percentage over his managerial 
career.[3] His teams won four National League pennants (1925, 1928, 1939 
and 1940) and two World Series championships (1925 and 1940), and he remains 
the only manager to win National League pennants with three different teams 
(Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Cincinnati). McKechnie's tenure in Pittsburgh 
came unraveled in 1926 when several of his players thought part-owner, 
vice president and de facto bench coach Fred Clarke was undermining him. 
Several of them thought Clarke was trying to regain the job he'd held from 
1900 to 1915. Three veteran players—Max Carey, Carson Bigbee and Babe Adams—demanded 
Clarke's removal from the bench. McKechnie, who by inclination was a player's 
manager, initially appeared to support them. However, fearing that he'd 
be seen as opposing the ownership, he was forced to denounce his own players. 
Ownership struck fast and hard, releasing Bigbee and Adams and waiving 
Carey. The dispute cut the legs out from under the Pirates, who fell to 
third. McKechnie was fired after the season.[2] The Cardinals finished 
the 1928 season in first place with a record 95 wins and 59 losses.[3] 
They were swept in the World Series by the New York Yankees.[4] McKechnie 
left the club after the World Series. Billy Southworth started the 1929 
season with 43 wins and 45 losses.[5] Gabby Street managed for a game before 
McKechnie returned as maanger.[3] He finished the 1929 season with a record 
of 34 wins and 29 losses.[5] McKechnie was not nearly as successful in 
Boston as he was at his other managerial stops, but he managed to finish 
"fourth or fifth with teams that should have been eighth." according to 
baseball historian Lee Allen.[6] The only year in which the Braves did 
not even do moderately well during McKechnie's time as manager was in 1935, 
when Babe Ruth was with the team. According to Allen, McKechnie claimed 
that Ruth's presence made it nearly impossible to enforce discipline. Ruth 
drew a huge salary, and lived apart from the team on the road.[6] Additionally, 
years of high living had rendered him a shadow of his former self. He couldn't 
run, and he made so many errors that three pitchers threatened to go on 
strike if he was in the lineup. Ruth lasted only about a month before retiring, 
and hit .181.[7] Despite fielding essentially the same team that finished 
fourth a year earlier, the Braves won 38 games that year and lost 115—the 
worst record in modern National League history. According to one baseball 
reference work, McKechnie had a poor sense of direction, which did not 
improve when, as the Reds' manager, he began traveling by plane. He arrived 
in an airport when the Reds were to play the Pirates at Forbes Field. He 
hailed a taxi and asked the driver to take him to the Schenley Hotel. "I 
never heard of it", said the driver. McKechnie gave him the names of the 
nearby streets. "Never heard of them either", the cabbie said. "How long 
have you been driving a cab here? the manager asked. "Twenty-five years 
and then some", said the driver, "But so help me I never heard of the Schenley 
Hotel! You must be in the wrong town! Where do you think you are?" "Pittsburgh", 
McKechnie said. "Pittsburgh, hell!" retorted the driver. "You're really 
lost. This is Detroit!" McKechnie was an unusual kind of manager for his 
era. A very religious man, he didn't smoke, didn't drink, and didn't use 
profanity. When he had a problem player who was likely to go out carousing, 
McKechnie's simple solution was to room with him. After McKechnie ended 
his nine-year association with the Reds in 1946, he was hired as a coach 
to be the right-hand man of young Cleveland Indians manager Lou Boudreau. 
The Boudreau–McKechnie Indians won a World Series in 1948. McKechnie coached 
with Boudreau for five seasons, with the Indians (1947–49) and Boston Red 
Sox (1952–53). McKechnie was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 
1962 and into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1967. McKechnie died 
at age 79 in Bradenton, Florida. The Pirates' spring training home, McKechnie 
Field in Bradenton, is named after him. McKechnie's son Bill, Jr. was the 
farm system director of the Cincinnati Redlegs in the mid-1950s and later 
served as president of the Pacific Coast League, and he was also the father
