Brownsville is a residential neighborhood located in eastern Brooklyn in 
New York City. The 1.163-square-mile (3.01 km2) area that comprises Brownsville 
has 58,300 residents as of the 2010 United States Census. Part of Brooklyn 
Community Board 16, Brownsville is generally considered part of greater 
East New York, though it is not actually a part of East New York itself. 
The neighborhood's boundaries are unclear, but it is generally bordered 
by Crown Heights and Weeksville to the northwest; Bushwick and Cypress 
Hills to the north; New Lots to the east; Canarsie to the south; and East 
Flatbush to the west. Founded in its current incarnation in 1858, it has 
been characterized as a slum through most of its existence. Initially a 
settlement composed of Jewish factory workers, Brownsville underwent a 
major demographic change in the 1950s that saw an influx of African-American 
and Latino residents. Since then, it has consistently held one of the highest 
poverty and crime rates of any neighborhood in New York City. The area 
that would become Brownsville was first used by the Dutch for farming, 
as well as manufacturing stone slabs and other things used to make buildings.[3] 
In 1823–1824, the Dutch founded the New Lots Reformed Church in nearby 
New Lots because the corresponding church in Flatbush was too far away.[4][5] 
The church, which has its own cemetery that was built in 1841,[6] was listed 
on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[7] In 1858, William 
Suydam parceled the land into 262 lots, providing simple two- to four-room 
accommodations for workers who were living there. However, Suydam vastly 
underestimated how undesirable the area was, and ran out of funding in 
1861.[8]:11 Because he failed to pay mortgages, the land was auctioned 
off to Charles S. Brown of Esopus, who subdivided the area and began calling 
it "Brownsville," advertising the area's wide open spaces to Jews who lived 
in Lower Manhattan.[3][8]:11 There were 250 houses in "Brown's Village" 
by 1883,[9] most of them occupied by factory workers who commuted to Manhattan.[8]:11 
In the 1880s, the area was a marshy floodplain that was used as a dumping 
ground. Fumes from the glue factories along Jamaica Bay would usually blow 
upwind into Brownsville.[8]:11 This place was inconveniently far enough 
from Manhattan that the affluent refused to move to Brownsville, but the 
land was cheap enough that tenements could be built for the poor there.[3][9] 
Brownsville was predominantly Jewish from the 1880s until the 1950s.[3][9] 
In 1887, businessman Elias Kaplan showed the first Jewish residents around 
Brownsville, painting the area as favorable compared to the Lower East 
Side, which he described as a place where one could not get away from the 
holds of labor unions.[8]:12[9] Kaplan built a factory and accommodations 
for his workers, then placed a synagogue, named Ohev Sholom, in his own 
factory.[8]:12 Other manufacturers that created low-tech products like 
food, furniture, and metals followed suit throughout the next decade, settling 
their factories in Brownsville. This led to much more housing being built 
there. The area bounded by present-day Dumont, Rockaway, and Liberty Avenues, 
and Junius Street, quickly became densely populated, with "factories, workshops, 
and stores" located next to housing.[8]:13 By 1900, an estimated 25,000 
people lived in Brownsville, most of them in two-story wooden frame accommodations 
built for two families each. Many of these buildings were grossly overcrowded, 
with up to eight families living in some of these two-family houses.[8]:13 
Many of these houses lacked amenities like running water, and their wood 
construction made these houses susceptible to fires. New brick-and-stone 
houses erected in the early 1900s were built with indoor plumbing and less 
prone to fire.[8]:13, 15 The quality of life was further decreased by the 
fact that the unpaved roads were used as open sewers.[8]:13 Compounding 
the problem, land prices were high in Brownsville (with lots available 
for $50 in 1907, then sold for $3,000 two years later), so in order to 
make their land purchases worthwhile, developers were frequently inspired 
to build as many apartments on a single lot as they possibly could.[8]:13–15 
Within twenty years of the factories' development, the area acquired a 
reputation as a vicious slum and breeding ground for crime. Indeed, as 
of 1904, 22 out of 25 housing units in Brownsville were tenement housing, 
rising to 24 out of 25 units by 1907.[8]:15 It became as dense as the very 
densely packed Lower East Side, according to one account.[3] This also 
led to dangerous conditions; a 1935 collapse of a tenement stairway killed 
two people and injured 43 others.[10] This overcrowding was despite the 
availability of empty space in the fringes of Brownsville. There were also 
no playgrounds in the area, and the only park in the vicinity was Betsy 
Head Park.[8]:16–17 In the early 20th century, the vast majority of Brownsville 
residents were born outside the United States; in 1910, 66% of the population 
were first-generation immigrants, and 80% of these immigrants were from 
Russia.[8] By 1920, over 80,000 of the area's 100,000 inhabitants were 
Russian Jews, and Brownsville had been nicknamed "Little Jerusalem."[9] 
As of the 1930s it was considered the most densely populated district in 
all of Brooklyn.[11] The population remained heavily Jewish, and the neighborhood 
boasted some seventy Orthodox synagogues.[11] Many of these synagogues 
still exist in Brownsville, albeit as churches.[12] Brownsville was also 
a place for radical political causes during this time. In 1916, Margaret 
Sanger set up the first birth control clinic in America on Amboy Street.[3][13] 
Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the neighborhood elected Socialist and 
American Labor Party candidates to the state assembly. Two Socialist candidates 
for mayor in 1929 and 1932 both received roughly a quarter of Brownsville 
residents' mayoral votes. Socialist attitudes prevailed among Brownsville 
residents until World War II.[8]:38 The area was fairly successful in its 
heyday. In 1942, there were 372 stores, including 8 banks and 43 stores 
selling menswear, along a 3-mile (4.8 km) stretch of Pitkin Avenue, which 
employed a combined 1,000 people and generated an estimated $90 million 
annually (equal to about $1,306,000,000 today if adjusted for inflation).[8]:31[14] 
The median income of $2,493 in 1933 (about $45,649 today) was twice that 
of a family living in the Lower East Side, who earned a median of $1,390 
(about $25,452 today) but lower than that of a middle-class family in outer 
Brooklyn ($4,320, inflation-adjusted to $79,104) or the Bronx ($3,750, 
inflation-adjusted to $68,666).[8]:32[14] The Fortunoff's furniture chain 
had its roots on Livonia Avenue, its flagship store overshadowed by the 
tracks of New York City Subway's New Lots Line from 1922 to 1964, eventually 
expanding elsewhere in the New York metropolitan area.[4][15] In the 1930s, 
Brownsville achieved notoriety as the birthplace of Murder, Inc.,[3] who 
contracted to kill between 400 and 1,000 people through the 1940s.[16] 
During the 1940s through the 1960s, the demographics of the population 
pivoted toward an African-American and Latino majority. In 1940, black 
residents made up 6% of Brownsville's population, but by 1950, there were 
double the number of blacks, most of whom were poor and occupied the neighborhood's 
most undesirable housing.[8]:84 Spurred on by urban planner Robert Moses, 
the city replaced some of Brownsville's old tenements with public housing 
blocks.[14] Although the neighborhood was racially segregated, there were 
more attempts at improved quality of life, public mixing, and solidarity 
between blacks and Jews than could be found in most other neighborhoods. 
However, due to socioeconomic barriers imposed by the disparities between 
the two populations, most of these improvements never came.[8]:6, 95–98 
The breaking point for the area's Jewish population came about in the 1950s, 
when the New York City Housing Authority decided to build more new public 
housing developments in blighted portions of Brownsville, the white population 
quickly moved out, even though the new NYCHA developments were actually 
in better condition than the old wooden tenements.[8]:5[9] Citing increased 
crime and their desire for social mobility, Jews left Brownsville en masse, 
with many black and Latino residents moving in.[8]:5[17]:19 By the 1960s, 
its population had become largely African American, and Brownsville's unemployment 
rate was 17 percent, twice the city's as a whole.[14] The newly majority-black 
Brownsville neighborhood had few community institutions or economic opportunities. 
It lacked a middle class, and its residents did not own the businesses 
they relied upon.[17]:19 In his book Brownsville, Brooklyn: Blacks, Jews, 
and the Changing Face of the Ghetto, W.E. Pritchett described the neighborhood 
as a "ghetto" whose quality of life was declining by the year. The NYCHA 
housing encouraged the creation of an African-American and Latino population 
that was poorer than the Jewish population it replaced.[8]:5–6 In 1966, 
black and Latino residents created the Brownsville Community Council in 
an effort to reverse the poverty and crime increases. The BCC secured welfare 
funding for 3,000 people, secure housing tenancies for 4,000 people, and 
voting rights for hundreds of new registrants. It closed down a block of 
Herzl Street for use as a play area, and it created the biweekly Brownsville 
Counselor newspaper to inform residents about government programs and job 
opportunities.[8]:200–204 However, in spite of the BCC's efforts, crime 
went up, with a threefold increase in reported homicides from ten in 1960 
to over thirty in 1966; a doubling of arrests from 1,883 in 1956 to over 
3,901 in 1966; and claims that there could actually have been more than 
six times as much crime than was reported. Multiple robberies of businesses 
were reported every day, with robbers simply lifting or bending the roll-down 
metal gates that protected many storefronts. City officials urged people 
to not use public transportation to travel to Brownsville.[8]:205 Brownsville 
began experiencing large-scale rioting and social disorder around this 
time. These problems manifested themselves in September 1967, a riot occurred 
following the death of an 11-year-old African American boy named Richard 
Ross, who was killed by an African-American NYPD detective, John Rattley, 
at the corner of St. Johns Place and Ralph Avenue. Rattley believed Ross 
had mugged a 73-year-old Jewish man.[18][19][20] The riot was led in part 
by Brooklyn militant Sonny Carson, who allegedly spread rumors that Rattley 
was white;[9] it was quelled after Brooklyn North Borough Commander Lloyd 
Sealy deployed a squad of 150 police officers.[21] Officer Rattley was 
not indicted by the grand jury.[18][19][20] Then, in 1968, Brownsville 
was the setting of a protracted and highly contentious teachers' strike.[22] 
The Board of Education had experimented with giving the people of the neighborhood 
control over the school. The new school administration fired several teachers 
in violation of union contract rules.[9] The teachers were all white and 
mostly Jewish, and the resulting strike badly divided the whole city. The 
resulting strike dragged on for half a year, becoming known as one of John 
Lindsay's "Ten Plagues."[23] It also served to segregate the remaining 
Jewish community from the larger black and Latino community.[24] By 1970, 
the 130,000-resident population of Brownsville[25] was 77% black and 19% 
Puerto Rican.[8]:148–149 Despite the activities of black civil rights organizations 
such as the NAACP and Urban League[8]:88 whose Brooklyn chapters were based 
in nearby Bedford-Stuyvesant, they were, overall, less concerned with the 
issues of the lower-income blacks who had moved into Brownsville, thus 
further isolating Brownsville's population. These changes corresponded 
to overall increases in segregation and inequality in New York City, as 
well as to the replacement of blue-collar with white-collar jobs.[17]:10–11 
The area gained a reputation for violence and poverty that was similar 
to the South Bronx's, a reputation that persisted through the 21st century.[4][14][26] 
Meanwhile, rioting and disorder continued. In June 1970, two men set fire 
to garbage bags to protest the New York City Department of Sanitation's 
reduction of trash collection pickups in Brownsville from six to two times 
per week. In the riots that followed this arson, one man was killed and 
multiple others were injured.[8]:239[27] In May 1971, the mostly black 
residents of Brownsville objected to reductions in Medicaid, welfare funds, 
and drug prevention programs in a peaceful protest that soon turned violent.[28] 
In the ensuing riot, protesters conflicted with police, with windows being 
broken, children stealing rides aboard buses, housewives tipping over banana 
stands, and the New York City Fire Department fighting over 100 fires in 
a single night.[14][25] By then, people were afraid to go out at night, 
and the forty white families in south Brownsville were concerned about 
public housing being expanded southward.[25] The streets boasted empty 
storefronts, with one block of Pitkin Avenue having over two-thirds of 
its 16 storefronts laying vacant.[8]:240 In 1970, Mayor John Lindsay referred 
to the area, which had been the city's poorest for several years, as "Bombsville" 
because of its high concentration of empty lots and burned-out buildings.[27] 
After a wave of arson throughout the 1970s ravaged the low-income communities 
of New York City, many of the residential structures in Brownsville were 
left seriously damaged or destroyed, and Brownsville became synonymous 
for urban decay in many aspects.[8]:6–7 Even at the beginning of this arson 
wave, 29% of residents were impoverished, a number that would increase 
in later years.[29] The city began to rehabilitate many formerly abandoned 
tenement-style apartment buildings and designate them low-income housing 
beginning in the late 1970s. Marcus Garvey Village, whose townhouse-style 
three-story apartment buildings had front doors and gardens, was an example 
of such low-income development that did not lower crime and poverty, as 
was intended; instead, the houses became the home base of a local gang, 
and poverty went up to 40%.[29] However, the East Brooklyn Congregations' 
Nehemiah Housing, which also constructed buildings in East New York and 
Spring Creek, served to help residents find affordable housing with a good 
quality of life.[8]:258–259[30] The neighborhood's crime rate decreased 
somewhat by the 1980s. Many subsidized multi-unit townhouses and newly 
constructed apartment buildings were built on vacant lots across the 1,200-acre 
(490 ha) expanse of the neighborhood, and from 2000 to 2003, applications 
for construction of residential buildings in Brownsville increased sevenfold.[26] 
However, these improvements are limited to certain sections of Brownsville. 
In 2013, 39% of residents fell below the poverty line, compared to 43% 
in 2000,[14] but the poverty rate of Brownsville is still relatively high,[26][31] 
being twice the city's overall rate as well as 13% higher than that of 
nearby Newark, New Jersey.[14] Brownsville families reported a median income 
of $15,978 as of 2008, below the United States Census poverty threshold.[32] 
The reasons for Brownsville's lack of wholesale gentrification are numerous. 
One reporter for the magazine The Nation observed that the Los Angeles 
neighborhood of Pico-Union, which had a poverty rate similar to Brownsville's 
in 2000, had become a Businessweek "next hot neighborhood" by 2007. Brownsville 
had not seen a similar revitalization because, unlike Pico-Union, it had 
not been surrounded by gentrified neighborhoods; did not have desirable 
housing; and was not a historic district or an area of other significance.[14] 
In addition, Brownsville is unlike similar neighborhoods in New York City 
that had since gentrified. The South Bronx's coastline gave way to attractions 
like Barretto Point Park; Bedford-Stuyvesant had cheap brownstones similar 
to the expensive ones in Park Slope, Fort Greene, and Prospect Heights; 
and Bushwick and Greenpoint became popular places for young professional 
workers once Williamsburg had become highly sought due to its waterfront 
location and proximity to Manhattan.[14] By contrast, Brownsville is surrounded 
by other high-poverty, high-crime neighborhoods like East New York, Ocean 
Hill, and East Flatbush.[14] Its high concentration of public housing developments 
has traditionally prevented gentrification in this area.[14] Brownsville 
is still majority African-American and Latino, with exactly two Jewish-owned 
businesses in Brownsville in 2012.[33] A New York Times columnist, writing 
for the paper's "Big City" section on 2012, stated that the many improvements 
to the city's overall quality of life, enacted by then-mayor Michael Bloomberg 
since 2002, "might have happened in Lithuania for all the effect they have 
had (or could have) on the lives of people in Brownsville."[34] On the 
other hand, the area's lack of gentrification might have kept most of residents' 
money within the local Brownsville economy. The area's largest employer 
is supposedly the United States Postal Service, and the lack of mobility 
for many residents encourages them to buy from local stores instead.[34] 
The total land area is 1.163 square miles (3.01 km2), and the ZIP codes 
for the neighborhood are 11212 and 11233.[1] Brownsville is bordered by 
Broadway or Atlantic Avenue to the north, on the Bedford–Stuyvesant and 
Bushwick border; East New York Avenue on the northwest, bordering Ocean 
Hill–Broadway Junction; East 98th Street/Ralph Avenue to the west, bordering 
Flatbush, Weeksville, and Crown Heights; the freight rail Bay Ridge Branch 
of the Long Island Rail Road and Linden Boulevard to the south, adjacent 
to the neighborhood of Canarsie; and Van Sinderen Avenue to the east, next 
to East New York.[26][35] It is part of Brooklyn Community Board 16, which 
also includes Ocean Hill–Broadway Junction.[36] As of 2008, there were 
a total of 28,298 housing units in Brownsville.[32] Brownsville is dominated 
by public housing developments of various types, mostly in a small area 
bounded by Powell Street and Rockaway, Livonia, and Sutter Avenues that 
is composed of multiple inward-facing developments located on six superblocks.[24] 
The neighborhood contains the highest concentration of NYCHA developments 
in New York City[9] and has the most densely concentrated area of public 
housing in the United States.[33][37] NYCHA owns the most housing units 
in Brownsville, with about one-third of the housing stock (around 10,000 
units)[9] in its 18 Brownsville developments, comprising over 100 buildings 
within 1 square mile (2.6 km2).[38] It is estimated that the housing developments 
alone contain nearly 21,000 people.[14] In addition, below Pitkin Avenue, 
there is also a significant concentration of semi-detached multi-unit row 
houses similar to those found in East New York and Soundview surrounding 
the public housing developments. Many have been torn down and replaced 
by vacant lots or newly constructed subsidized attached multi-unit rowhouses 
with gardens, driveways, and finished basements.[26] Most of these houses 
were built in East New York, Ocean Hill, and Brownsville under the Nehemiah 
development program.[26] Of the Nehemiah developments, most of them were 
built on the western half of the neighborhood.[26] Other newly built or 
restored housing includes 3,871 housing units for low-income residents, 
as well as Noble Drew Ali Plaza, a 385-unit apartment building that was 
notorious for drug dealing before the New York City Department of Housing 
Preservation and Development helped New York Mets first baseman Mo Vaughn 
buy and redevelop the building.[39] The Livonia Avenue Initiative, a multi-phase 
project situated along Livonia Avenue, is intended to create 791 apartments 
or houses for low-income residents.[40] The initiative includes Livonia 
Commons, a proposed mixed-use project on the north side of Livonia Avenue. 
Livonia Commons' postmodern buildings will contain 270 apartments for lower-income 
citizens and 11,000 square feet (1,000 m2) of commercial space at ground 
level.[41] The initiative's 21,000 square feet (2,000 m2) of community 
space will host a senior center and two concentrations of school classrooms, 
operated by two different groups. There would also be a gym, a swimming 
pool, a darkroom, and some studios.[41] The entire Livonia Commons project 
would add 71,700 square feet (6,660 m2) of mixed-use space in multiple 
buildings.[40] So far, 242 apartments are being built, in addition to 468 
affordable-housing units that have already been built in the East New York/Brownsville 
area.[42] Closer to Ocean Hill, there are many limestone and brownstone 
townhouses.[26] There are also a few tenements in the area.[9] In Brownsville, 
about 73% of rental housing is poorly maintained, more than the citywide 
rate of 59% and the boroughwide rate of 62%.[43]:5 The Loews Pitkin, an 
opulent 85-foot-high (26 m), 2,827-seat movie theater built in 1929, was 
among 22 theaters in the area; the rest of the theaters had either been 
demolished or converted into stores.[3] The Loews Pitkin, named after theater 
entrepreneur Marcus Loew, had fallen in disuse by the 1970s before being 
revitalized in the late 2000s.[3][39] The theater's decaying interior was 
used as a church and a furniture store before Poko Partners bought the 
space in 2008 and redeveloped the theater into a charter school and retail 
space for $43 million.[39] The theater was renovated in response to residents' 
requests for more retail space, and as part of the theater's refurbishment, 
the charter school would open in 2012 along with 60,000 square feet (5,600 m2) 
of retail space.[39] Many of Brownsville's empty lots are now community 
gardens, which are also widespread in nearby East New York[44] and are 
maintained by multiple community groups; the gardens are often planted 
with vegetables that could provide food for residents.[45] The gardens 
were supposed to be temporary, but they were so popular that in 2015, the 
New York City government canceled plans to allow developers to build on 
34 garden sites in Brownsville (despite nine other gardens in the area 
having been approved for redevelopment).[46] The NYPD's 65th Precinct (originally 
the 73rd Precinct), built in 1901, covered most of the area until its closure 
in the mid-1980s. The old 65th Precinct building at 1546 East New York 
Avenue was then sold to a family with the last name of Chen.[47] In 2004, 
the Chens sold the building to Family Services Network of New York, a nonprofit 
organization funded by the state government. Family Services borrowed $1.1 
million, but failed to pay the mortgage. Despite Family Services' grandiose 
$3.8 million plan to rehabilitate the 65th Precinct building into a community 
center, it sits derelict as of 2012[update], with graffiti on the walls, 
garbage in the interior, and jail cells still intact.[47] One block of 
Livonia Avenue from Barbey Street to Schenck Avenue is designated as "African 
Burial Ground Square," commemorating an African burial ground at the site 
that was discovered in 2010.[48] The site contains remains similar to those 
found in the African Burial Ground National Monument in lower Manhattan, 
as well as those discovered under the former 126th Street Depot in East 
Harlem.[49] As part of the designation, the Schenck Playground, behind 
the New Lots branch of the Brooklyn Public Library, would be rethemed with 
African cultural motifs and designs.[4] Hyman Spitz Florists, one of the 
businesses that dates back to Brownsville's initial settlement, was founded 
in 1898.[3] It persisted at the same address, 1685 Rockaway Avenue, until 
2004. Hyman Spitz Florists had helped provide flowers for such occasions 
as Donald and Ivana Trump's wedding.[3][50] Based on data from the 2010 
United States Census, the population of Brownsville was 58,300, a decrease 
of 799 (1.4%) from the 59,099 counted in 2000. Covering an area of 750.44 
acres (303.69 ha), the neighborhood had a population density of 77.7 inhabitants 
per acre (49,700/sq mi; 19,200/km2).[2] The entirety of Community Board 
16 had 86,377 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2015 Community Health Profile, 
with an average life expectancy of 74.1 years.[43]:2 Most inhabitants are 
young or middle-aged, with 29% between the ages of 0–17, 27% between 25–44, 
and 22% between 45–64. The ratio of old and college-aged residents was 
younger, at 10% and 12% respectively.[43]:2 The racial makeup of the neighborhood 
was 76.1% (44,364) African American, 0.8% (471) White, 0.3% (165) Native 
American, 0.7% (416) Asian, 0.0% (18) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (180) from 
other races, and 1.2% (703) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino 
of any race were 20.6% (11,983) of the population.[51] 29.9% of the population 
were high school graduates and 8.4% had a bachelor's degree or higher.[51] 
This was reflected in the Community Health Profile.[43]:2 As of 2008, the 
median household income was $15,978.[32] In 2015, an estimated 37% of Brownsville 
residents lived in poverty, compared to 24% in all of Brooklyn and 21% 
in all of New York City. One in six residents (16%) were unemployed, compared 
to 11% in the rest of both Brooklyn and New York City. Rent burden, or 
the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 56% 
in Brownsville, slightly higher than the citywide and boroughwide rates 
of 51% and 52% respectively.[43]:6 The NYPD's 73rd Precinct is located 
at 1470 East New York Avenue.[52] NYCHA property in the area is patrolled 
separately by Police Service Area #2 (P.S.A. 2).[53] Brownsville has consistently 
been considered to be the murder capital of New York City,[54] with the 
73rd Precinct ranking 69th safest out of 69 city precincts for per-capita 
crime in 2009.[55] That year, there were 3 murders per 10,000 residents 
(higher than in any other neighborhood in the city), making for 28 overall 
murders in Brownsville; in overall crime, the 73rd Precinct was the 66th 
safest out of 69 neighborhoods.[55] In the fifteen years between 1990 and 
2005, reports of murder in Brownsville–Ocean Hill dropped to 63 percent 
(to 22 murders in 2005); robberies 79 percent (to 597 in 2005); and felony 
assaults decreased 51 percent (to 562 in 2005).[26] Crime rates in Brownsville 
had declined in the same manner that they had elsewhere in the city, but 
the declines were not as dramatic as in other areas of the city, with 72 
people shot and 15 killed in Brownsville in 2013.[56][57] At 348 per 100,000 
adult residents in prison, Brownsville's incarceration rate is three times 
the city's as a whole and higher than all but one other neighborhood's 
incarceration rate. At a non-fatal assault rate of 180 per 100,000 people, 
Brownsville also sees the most violent crimes per capita out of any neighborhood 
in the city.[43]:7 By contrast, Morrisania, a Bronx neighborhood that once 
had a crime rate as high as Brownsville's, saw its crime rate decline by 
25 percent between 1998 and 2011, while Brownsville's crime rate stayed 
roughly even during the same time period.[34] The social problems associated 
with poverty, from crime to drug addiction, have plagued the area for decades. 
Despite the decline of crime compared to its peak during the crack and 
heroin epidemics, violent crime continues to be a serious problem in the 
community, especially gang-related gun violence.[14][58] Empty lots and 
unused storefronts are common in Brownsville due to high rates of crime, 
mostly in the area's public housing developments. A reporter for The New 
York Times observed that some of the area's playgrounds were inadequately 
maintained with broken lights and unlocked gates, and that shootings were 
common in these public housing developments.[59] Brownsville was so dangerous 
that one UPS driver, robbed at gunpoint, needed an armed security guard 
to accompany him while delivering packages to houses in the neighborhood.[33] 
In an effort to reduce crime, the NYPD started a stop-and-frisk program 
in the early 2000s; this was controversial especially in Brownsville, with 
93% of residents in one eight-block area reportedly being stopped and frisked 
(compared to a 7% rate citywide).[60][61] However, serious crime per resident 
is decreasing, and from 2000 to 2011, the rate dropped from 45.0 to 35.3 
serious crimes per 1,000 residents.[62] The firehouse for the New York 
City Fire Department (FDNY)'s Engine Co. 231/Ladder Co. 120 is located 
in Brownsville.[63] A new 21,000-square-foot (2,000 m2), $32 million FDNY 
facility is under construction at 815 Sterling Place in Brownsville. Designed 
by Chicago-based architectural firm Studio Gang, the new facility will 
be both an FDNY training center and the firehouse for Rescue Company 2. 
Ground broke on the project in July 2016.[64][65] The new firehouse, announced 
in December 2015,[66] will replace Rescue 2's old location, a small building 
at 1472 Bergen Street in Crown Heights, which was built in the 1920s and 
has been occupied by Rescue 2 since 1985.[67] Just east of the Crown Heights–Utica 
Avenue subway station, on the border with Crown Heights, there is a park 
called Lincoln Terrace (also known as Arthur S. Somers Park), which slopes 
gently down toward the southern Brooklyn coastline. The New Lots Line transitions 
from a tunnel to an elevated structure within this park.[68] The 21 acres 
(8.5 ha) of land for Lincoln Terrace was purchased by the city in 1895–1897. 
In order to deter aircraft from flying through the area during World War 
I, parts of the park had turrets installed in "serviceable but inconspicuous 
locations" in 1918.[68] Through 1935, additional land was added to the 
park (including land purchased from the Interborough Rapid Transit Company 
in 1928, which had built its New Lots Line in 1916). Streets were closed 
to make room for the extra parkland.[68] The park was originally named 
after Abraham Lincoln, but in 1932, the western section of the park (west 
of Rockaway Avenue) was renamed after activist Arthur S. Somers, an area 
resident who had died that year. Around that time, the park and its playgrounds 
were refurbished.[68] Betsy Head Park is located in a lot on the north 
side of Livonia Avenue bounded by Strauss Street and Thomas S. Boyland 
Street.[69] Betsy Head, a rich Briton, died in 1907 and gave the city $190,000 
to spend on "recreational facilities" as part of her will.[69] When it 
was opened in 1914, the park, which was then the only one in the neighborhood, 
was "overcrowded" upon opening.[8]:16 It was lauded for its "rest pavilion, 
wading pool, playground, school farm garden, bath building, swimming pool, 
field house, running track, and tennis courts," and in the 1915 Panama–Pacific 
International Exposition, received first prize in the New York City Parks 
portion of the competition.[69] In 1936, a new Olympic-size swimming pool, 
one of 11 across the city, was added as part of a Works Progress Administration 
project.[70] Three years later, in 1939, the pool was rebuilt after it 
sustained fire damage.[69] The park was renovated at a cost of $5.2 million 
in 1983, and a new running track was added in 2001.[69] In 2008, the New 
York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Betsy Head Play 
Center a landmark, making it the first and only individual landmark in 
Brownsville.[70] In early 2016, the playground inside the park was renovated 
for $5.05 million based on a design by the Rockwell Group, with an "Imagination 
Playground" surrounded by a 6-foot-tall (1.8 m) wooden pathway. The new 
play area, which features movable foam play blocks, is based on the group's 
Burling Slip playground in Lower Manhattan, and builds off several prototype 
designs for such a playground that were unveiled in Brownsville in 2009.[71] 
At Livonia Avenue and Powell Street, Livonia Park is named after Livonia, 
in the Baltic region in what is now Latvia and Estonia. Livonia Avenue 
itself is so named for the same reason.[72] According to the New York City 
Department of Parks and Recreation, the park honors Livonia and its native 
people, the Livonians. The Livonians were never fully independent, instead 
being alternatively led by the Teutonic Order, Sweden, and the Russian 
Empire. The Kingdom of Livonia was a nominal state of Russia from 1570 
to 1578 during the Livonian War, but did not actually gain independence.[72] 
Eventually, the Livonians were assimilated into the larger Latvian population, 
keeping parts of their language and a few other cultural vestiges. The 
Russian Empire became communist as part of the October Revolution in 1917, 
and Latvia and Estonia gained independence soon after, only to become part 
of communist Russia again until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.[72] 
The park itself was designated on August 15, 1969, as part of NYCHA's development 
of the Tilden Houses.[4][72] There are trees, benches, gaming spaces, a 
drinking fountain, and many grassy plots within the park.[72] The red-and-white 
bricks in Livonia Park feature the color of the Latvian flag.[4] Brownsville 
also has its own recreation facility with indoor swimming pools, outdoor 
athletic fields, and a playground. The Brownsville Recreation Center at 
the corner of Linden Boulevard, Mother Gaston Boulevard, and Christopher 
Avenue. Like all other indoor pools in the city, the Brownsville Recreation 
Center requires a NYC Parks pool membership.[73] It was opened in 1953 
as the Brownsville Boys' Club, a "one-room clubhouse" affiliated with the 
Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Over the next two years, the club raised 
$1.5 million in funds, and the city opened a brand-new recreation facility.[74] 
Improvements were made to the center in the late 1990s and 2000s, including 
$265,000 of general repairs in 1996; $400,000 of heat and air conditioning 
refurbishments in 1998; and a $1.5 million renovation in 2008 that entailed 
installing a new playground, improving amenities such as benches and lighting, 
and replacing the athletic field with artificial turf.[74] The "Soul in 
the Hole" is a famous basketball court in Brownsville. The Hole is known 
for street basketball,[75] and the New York Daily News characterizes it 
as having the "toughest" streetball competition in Brooklyn.[76] It is 
located in the Brownsville Houses along Rockaway Avenue between Riverdale 
and Livonia Avenues.[77] Famous players who played there included Fly Williams.[78] 
The traffic triangle bounded by Pitkin and East New York Avenues and Legion 
Street was originally named Vanderveer Park after Peter L. Vandeveer, the 
former owner of the land constituting that triangle.[79] Vanderveer donated 
the land in 1896, and in 1911, it was renamed Zion Park in recognition 
of the Jewish community.[79][80] The Zion Park War Memorial, a monumental 
wall based on a design by sculptor Charles Cary Rumsey and architect Henry 
Beaumont Herts, was installed in the triangle and dedicated in 1925.[79] 
This monument features a star of David. The bas relief sculptures are mounted 
on a limestone stele and side pylons.[79][81] The Wyckoff Triangle, bounded 
by New Lots, Riverdale, and Van Siclen Avenues, is named after local property 
owner Hendrick Wyckoff, who ceded the land used for the traffic triangle.[4] 
During the American Revolutionary War, Wyckoff was a spy for the colonists 
rebelling against the British. Through the 1920s, Wyckoff's family maintained 
the park, which is now privately maintained because it is too small to 
be a NYC Parks public space.[4] Brownsville is a heavily Democratic area; 
in the 2012 presidential campaign, President Barack Obama "won what was 
very close to a unanimous vote" in the neighborhood.[82] Brownsville is 
part of the 20th State Senate district,[83] and the 55th State Assembly 
district.[84] It is part of District 41 in the New York City Council; since 
2006, Democrat Darlene Mealy has held the seat.[85][86][87] Brownsville 
was once part of New York's 10th congressional district,[88] but following 
redistricting in 2012, the neighborhood became part of the 9th congressional 
district.[89] In the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton received 4,889 votes (73.9%) to Bernie Sanders's 1,729 votes (26.1%).[90] 
Brownsville had very few Republican primary voters: just 40 Brownsville 
voters cast ballots in the 2016 Republican primary.[91] Brownsville suffers 
from major health disparities in comparison to the rest of New York City. 
In 2006, Brownsville had the highest infant mortality rate in New York 
City (12.5 per 1,000 births), twice the overall city rate (5.9 per 1,000 
births).[92] Preterm and teenage births were also more common in Brownsville 
than in other places citywide. In Brownsville, there were 13.8 preterm 
births per 1,000 live births (compared to 9.0 per 1,000 citywide), and 
38.5 teenage births per 1,000 live births (compared to 23.6 per 1,000 citywide), 
giving the area the second-highest teenage birth rate of any neighborhood 
in the city.[43]:7 In 2015, Brownsville had the lowest average life span 
(74.1 years) of any New York City neighborhood.[43]:2[93] A New York City 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene community health profile the same 
year found that in Brownsville, the average life expectancy is eleven years 
shorter than in Manhattan's Financial District.[94] Brownsville has a high 
population of residents who are uninsured, or who receive healthcare through 
Medicaid.[95] In 2015, this population of uninsured residents was estimated 
to be 18%, which is lower than the citywide rate of 20%, and is expected 
to decrease in coming years because of the enactment of the Affordable 
Care Act.[43]:10 Air pollution in Brownsville is 0.0088 milligrams per 
cubic metre (8.8×10−9 oz/cu ft), slightly higher than the citywide and 
boroughwide averages.[43]:5 Fourteen percent of Brownsville residents are 
smokers, which is around the city average of 15% of residents being smokers. 
In Brownsville, 32% of residents are obese and 15% are diabetic, higher 
than the citywide averages of 24% and 10% respectively. Eighty-three percent 
of residents eat some fruits and vegetables every day, which is slightly 
lower than the city's average of 88%.[43]:8 Despite this, in 2015, four 
out of five residents (81%) described their health as "good," "very good," 
or "excellent."[43]:2 There are 15 tobacco stores per 10,000 people (compared 
to the 11 tobacco stores per ten-thousand people both in Brooklyn and in 
New York City as a whole), but there are also 277 square feet (25.7 m2) 
of supermarket footage per 100 people, higher than the citywide average 
of 177 square feet (16.4 m2) per hundred people and the boroughwide average 
of 156 square feet (14.5 m2) per hundred people.[43]:5 Brookdale University 
Hospital and Medical Center is located in the neighborhood. The hospital 
has suffered from violence; in 2014, the federal Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration issued a citation to the hospital for "willful" failure 
to protect hospital employees after an extensive series of incidents of 
violence against hospital workers took place.[96] Brownsville has one of 
the highest rates of psychiatric hospitalization in the city.[97] Brownsville 
has historically suffered from high levels of childhood lead exposure from 
environmental lead, particularly from lead-based paint in dilapidated housing 
stock.[98][99] Public schools are operated by the New York City Department 
of Education. Due to the area's high population density, there are 39 public 
and charter schools serving elementary and middle school students in Brownsville.[100] 
Numbered public primary schools include P.S. 150 Christopher; P.S. 156 
Waverly; P.S. 165 Ida Posner; P.S. 184 Newport; P.S. 189 Lincoln Terrace; 
P.S. 219 Kennedy-King; P.S. 284 Lew Wallace; P.S. 298; P.S. 327 Dr Rose 
B English; P.S. 332 Charles H Houston School; I.S. 392; P.S. 396 Special 
Education School; P.S. 398 Walter Weaver; P.S. 41 Francis White; P.S. 770 
New American Academy; and P.S/I.S. 323 Elementary School.[100] There are 
three high schools in Brownsville; two are housed in the same building 
at 226 Bristol Street. Teachers Preparatory opened in September 2001, while 
Frederick Douglass Academy VII opened in September 2004. Teachers Preparatory 
School serves 6th through 12th graders with 99% minority enrollment,[101] 
receiving a grade of "A" on both its middle school and high school report 
cards for 2008.[102] FDA VII serves 9th through 12th grades with 99% minority 
enrollment.[12] The third high school is Brownsville Academy, which is 
a Diploma Plus transfer school serving 10th through 12th grades with a 
100% minority enrollment.[103] It received a "Well Developed" score for 
2008–2009.[104] It also received a grade of B on its 2007–2008 report card.[105] 
Brownsville Academy, a relatively small school with 205 students as of 
2016–2017, is located at 1150 East New York Avenue, close to the Crown 
Heights border.[106] The Brooklyn Public Library operates a branch on 61 
Glenmore Avenue, near Watkins Street.[107] Brownsville has significantly 
higher dropout rates in its schools.[108] Brownsville also has one of the 
highest concentrations of "persistently violent" schools of any area in 
New York State, with five such schools in Brownsville and East New York 
on the 2015–2016 list of most dangerous schools.[109][a] Students must 
pass through metal detectors and swipe ID cards to enter the buildings.[110] 
This arose from two school shootings in East New York in 1991–1992 that, 
combined, resulted in the deaths of three students and the injury of one 
teacher.[111] Other problems in local schools include low test scores, 
with 95% of students scoring below grade level on state tests.[112] Brownsville 
generally has lower ratios of college-educated residents than the rest 
of the city. Only 18% of the population have a college education or higher, 
but 28% have less than a high school education and 53% are high school 
graduates with some college education. By contrast, 38% of Brooklynites 
and 41% of city residents have a college education or higher.[43]:6 However, 
despite these drawbacks, the percentage of Brownsville students excelling 
in reading and math has been increasing, with reading achievement rising 
from 26 percent in 2000 to 31 percent in 2001, and math achievement rising 
from 20 percent to 38 percent within the same time period.[62] Brownsville 
has the second-highest rate of student homelessness in Brooklyn.[97] It 
also has the highest rate of elementary school student absenteeism in New 
York City, with 40 percent of Brownsville elementary school students missing 
twenty or more days per school year.[43]:7[60][97] The New York City Subway 
serves Brownsville on the IRT New Lots Line (2 3 4 5 trains) and BMT Canarsie 
Line (L train). The entire New Lots Line, and the Canarsie Line between 
Sutter Avenue and New Lots Avenue, are definitively in Brownsville, with 
the Atlantic Avenue and East 105th Street subway stations at the neighborhood's 
borders.[113] Due to the lines being created by two different, competing 
subway companies (the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn 
Rapid Transit Company, respectively), a free transit connection does not 
exist between the two lines, which provide the area's only subway service.[114] 
A pedestrian bridge from the Livonia Avenue station on the Canarsie Line 
spans west across the Long Island Rail Road's Bay Ridge Branch to Junius 
Street, where an entrance to that street's station along the New Lots Line 
is less than a block away. There are proposals to convert the overpass 
into a free-transfer passage between the two stations, due to increasing 
ridership and plans for additional housing in the area.[114] Money is allocated 
in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 2015–2019 Capital Program 
to build this transfer. The stations would also need to be upgraded to 
become compliant with mobility accessibility guidelines under the Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990.[115] MTA Regional Bus Operations operates 
bus lines in the area. The B15 bus crosses Brownsville horizontally, for 
the most part using New Lots Avenue; the B14 bus uses Pitkin and Sutter 
Avenues through its route in the area where Brownsville overlaps with East 
New York.[116] North–south bus lines include the B7 on Saratoga Avenue; 
the B60 on Rockaway Avenue; the B82 and B83 on Pennsylvania Avenue (the 
latter also via Van Siclen Avenue); and the B6 and B84 connecting to the 
New Lots Avenue station via Ashford Street.[116] The B8, B35, and B47 have 
segments along the outer borders of Brownsville, and the B8 and B35 both 
terminate along Hegeman Avenue in the neighborhood's southwestern portion.[116] 
In 2011, 72% of residents used public transportation, up from 66% in 2000. 
More than 85% of residents live within 0.5 miles (0.80 km) of the subway.[24][62] 
The street grid aligns with the general East New York street grid, though 
ten streets from the Canarsie grid extend into Brownsville. The easternmost 
of these streets, East 98th Street, serves as the ending point for many 
main thoroughfares in central Brooklyn, including Church Avenue, Kings 
Highway, and Sutter Avenues.[4] As a result of its Jewish heritage, there 
are several streets named after Jewish community figures in the western 
portion of Brownsville. In 1913, nine years after writer Theodor Herzl 
died, residents successfully petitioned to rename Ames Street to Herzl 
Street, marking one of the few streets outside Israel that are named Herzl 
Street.[4] One block away, the incorrectly spelled Strauss Street was named 
after two former Macy's co-owners, brothers Nathan and Isidor Straus, the 
latter of whom died when his wife Ida gave up a seat on a lifeboat off 
the sinking RMS Titanic.[4] One of Brownsville's main thoroughfares, Pitkin 
Avenue,[117] is named after businessman John R. Pitkin of Connecticut. 
Pitkin developed East New York starting in 1835.[3] Hopkinson Street, originally 
named after Declaration of Independence signer Francis Hopkinson,[118] 
was renamed in honor of State Assemblyman Thomas S. Boyland, who served 
the neighborhood from 1977 until his death in 1982.[4] Incidentally, many 
places in Brownsville, including two schools and a housing development, 
are named after Boyland and two of his family members (his brother William 
F. Boyland Sr. and his nephew William Boyland Jr.), who also went into 
politics and represented Brownsville in various levels of local government.[119] 
Stone Avenue was renamed after Rosetta Gaston (1895–1981), founder of the 
Brownsville Heritage House on the avenue.[4] Mother Gaston, as she was 
called, operated the Heritage House inside the Stone Avenue Library, a 
Jacobean Revival-style library built in 1914 by William Tubby.[120] The 
1934 novel Call It Sleep, by Henry Roth, is about the Schearl family, who 
moves from Brownsville back to the Lower East Side. The main character, 
young David Schearl, must endure the "terror of poverty" on the Lower East 
Side. Brownsville, by contrast, is described in the book as a vast improvement 
over the Lower East Side.[8]:15[121] Alfred Kazin wrote about 1920s-era
