Timothy Reid McClelland (born December 12, 1951) is a former umpire in 
Major League Baseball who worked in the American League from 1983 to 1999 
and throughout both leagues from 2000 until his retirement prior to the 
2015 season. He has called many important games, from post-season games 
to the George Brett "Pine Tar" game in 1983. More recently, he was the 
plate umpire for the Sammy Sosa corked bat game on June 3, 2003, when the 
Chicago Cubs hosted the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Wrigley Field. He has worn 
uniform number 36 since his promotion to the AL, and kept the number when 
Major League Baseball merged the American and National League umpiring 
staffs in 2000. McClelland retired as MLB's second-most senior umpire (after 
Joe West), and was the second tallest major league umpire at 6'6" (Jordan 
Baker is 6'7"). He was known in the past for working in a kneeling position 
behind the plate, but switched in 2006 to a "box position," a form of squat. 
He is also noted for his deliberate umpiring mechanics, which have earned 
him the nickname "Rain Delay McClelland,"[1] and for his small but consistent 
strike zone.[2] Major league pitcher Zack Greinke has said of McClelland's 
tight strike zone, "For some reason, he's the one umpire that scares me. 
I have nightmares about him."[3] McClelland has umpired in numerous noteworthy 
baseball games. He has been a World Series umpire four times (1993, 2000, 
2002 and 2006), and worked in three All-Star games (1986, 1998 and 2003), 
calling balls and strikes on the last occasion. He has also called five 
Division Series (1997, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006), serving as crew chief in 
1997, 2004, and 2006. McClelland has officiated eight League Championship 
Series (1988, 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2009), serving 
as crew chief in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2009.[4] McClelland was 
the first base umpire for Jack Morris' no-hitter on April 7, 1984[5] and 
was the umpire at third base for Nolan Ryan's sixth career no-hitter on 
June 11, 1990.[6] McClelland was behind the plate at Yankee Stadium when 
David Wells pitched a perfect game against the Minnesota Twins on May 17, 
1998.[7] McClelland was umpiring at second base on April 21, 2012, when 
Philip Humber threw a perfect game.[8] McClelland also was the umpire during 
the 2003 game where famous slugger Sammy Sosa was caught with a corked 
bat at Wrigley Field during the interleague game between the Tampa Bay 
Devil Rays and the Chicago Cubs.[9] Sosa broke his bat hitting a routine 
ground out, and upon inspection of the fragments of the bat, cork was found, 
leading to Sosa's ejection and subsequent suspension. McClelland was the 
home plate umpire for the single-game playoff to decide the NL's 2007 wild 
card team, in which the Colorado Rockies defeated the San Diego Padres 
9–8 in 13 innings.[10] He also worked the 2008 one-game playoff between 
the Minnesota Twins and the Chicago White Sox, which the White Sox won 
on a Jim Thome home run in the 7th inning 1–0.[11] During a spring training 
game on March 19, 2013, McClelland used the rare umpiring technique of 
calling balls and strikes from the infield while waiting for another umpire 
to put on the home plate gear after home plate umpire Seth Buckminster 
sustained a broken left hand and was forced to leave the game.[12] In his 
first season in the AL, McClelland was behind the plate in the infamous 
"Pine Tar Game" at Yankee Stadium on July 24, 1983, in which George Brett 
of the Kansas City Royals hit an apparent two-run home run, which was immediately 
protested by New York Yankees manager Billy Martin due to an obscure equipment 
rule. McClelland inspected Brett's bat, which had pine tar 24 inches up 
the handle. Because of the rule stating that pine tar cannot extend more 
than 18 inches up a bat handle, McClelland called Brett out, which nullified 
the home run. AL president Lee MacPhail later overturned McClelland's decision, 
clarifying that any protest regarding equipment must be made prior to a 
play, and had the Yankees and Royals replay the inning. Nine years later, 
McClelland was a member of the crew that worked Brett's 3,000th-hit game 
and was one of the first to congratulate him. In 2007, McClelland worked 
home plate for the NL's Wild Card tiebreaker game between the San Diego 
Padres and the Colorado Rockies. In the bottom of the 13th inning, with 
the score even at 8–8, the Rockies scored the winning run on a sacrifice 
fly when McClelland called the tagging baserunner, Matt Holliday, safe 
at the plate. There were questions afterward as to whether Holliday had 
actually touched home plate on his slide. Padres manager Bud Black stated 
after the game that he believed Holliday did touch the plate.[10] Following 
the game, McClelland told The Des Moines Register that "Michael Barrett 
stuck out his leg, but he didn't have it planted in the ground. What I 
saw was Holliday kind of slide through that leg and touch the plate."[13] 
McClelland defended his deliberate safe call saying that he wanted to see 
if Barrett held on to the ball.[13] On October 20, 2009, in an American 
League Championship Series game between the New York Yankees and the Los 
Angeles Angels, McClelland made two highly publicized controversial calls. 
McClelland called Nick Swisher out for leaving the base too early when 
Swisher was tagging up on a fly ball. Some analysts contend that video 
replays showed this call to be erroneous. With one out in the top of the 
fifth inning, an apparent double play was negated when McClelland called 
Robinson Canó safe at third after he was tagged by Mike Napoli while not 
in contact with the base. After spending the 2014 season on umpiring's 
Disabled List, McClelland formally retired from the MLB staff prior to 
the 2015 season. Accordingly, his last game umpired occurred in September 
2013, but he did not officially retire until after the 2014 season.[14] 
McClelland, who received both his BA and MA from Michigan State University,[15] 
resides in West Des Moines, Iowa.[16] He is married to Sandy McClelland
