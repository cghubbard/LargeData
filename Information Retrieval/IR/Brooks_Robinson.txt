Brooks Calbert Robinson, Jr. (born May 18, 1937) is an American former 
professional baseball player.[1][2] He played his entire 23-year major 
league career for the Baltimore Orioles (1955–1977).[1] He batted and threw 
right-handed, though he was a natural left-hander.[3] Nicknamed "The Human 
Vacuum Cleaner" or "Mr. Hoover",[4] he is considered one of the greatest 
defensive third basemen in major league history.[5] He won 16 consecutive 
Gold Glove Awards during his career,[6] tied with pitcher Jim Kaat for 
the second-most all-time for any player at any position. Robinson was elected 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1983.[4] Robinson was born in Little Rock, 
Arkansas, to Brooks Calbert and Ethel Mae (née Denker) Robinson.[7] His 
father worked for Colonia Bakery in Little Rock and later became a captain 
with the Little Rock Fire Department.[8] His mother worked for Sears Roebuck 
& Company and then in the controller's office at the state capitol.[9] 
His father played second base for a semi-pro team.[10] Young Brooks Robinson, 
Jr., delivered the Arkansas Gazette on his bike[11] and also operated the 
scoreboard and sold soft drinks at Lamar Porter Field.[12] After he graduated 
from Little Rock High School on May 27, 1955, where he was scouted for 
the Arkansas Razorbacks baseball program in Fayetteville,[13][14] he played 
in South America in 1955 and in Cuba in 1957. In the offseason of 1956–1957, 
and then again in 1958, he attended two winter semesters at Little Rock 
University, majoring in business. He went into the army in 1959,[15] joining 
the Arkansas National Guard right before he was to be drafted into the 
United States Army.[14] Robinson was signed by the Orioles as an amateur 
free agent in 1955.[16] In 1964, Robinson had his best season offensively, 
hitting for a .318 batting average with 28 home runs and led the league 
with 118 runs batted in, winning the American League Most Valuable Player 
Award.[1][17] In the American League MVP voting, he received 18 of the 
20 first-place votes, with Mickey Mantle finishing second.[17] In 1966, 
he was voted the All-Star Game Most Valuable Player, and finished second 
to teammate Frank Robinson in the American League Most Valuable Player 
Award voting, as the Orioles went on to win the 1966 World Series against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers.[18][19][20][21] In the 1970 post-season, Robinson 
hit for a .583 batting average in the 1970 American League Championship 
Series against the Minnesota Twins.[22] In the 1970 World Series against 
the Cincinnati Reds, Robinson had a .429 batting average with 2 home runs;[22] 
however, it was his defensive prowess at third base that stood out, making 
several impressive plays during the series that robbed the Reds of apparent 
base hits.[23][24] His performance won him the World Series MVP Award presented 
by SPORT,[18] as well as the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of 
the year.[25] After the 1970 World Series, Cincinnati Reds manager Sparky 
Anderson quipped, "I'm beginning to see Brooks in my sleep. If I dropped 
this paper plate, he'd pick it up on one hop and throw me out at first."[26] 
In his playing career, Robinson was selected for the All-Star team in 15 
consecutive years (1960-74) and played in four World Series.[1] He compiled 
a .267 career batting average with 2,848 hits, 268 home runs and 1357 runs 
batted in.[1] Robinson led the American League in fielding percentage a 
record 11 times, and at the time of his retirement, his .971 career fielding 
average was the highest ever for a third baseman.[27] His totals of 2870 
games played at third base, 2697 career putouts, 6205 career assists, 8902 
career total chances and 618 double plays were records for third basemen 
at the time of his retirement.[27] Robinson's 23 seasons with one team 
set a new major league record, since tied by Carl Yastrzemski. Only Yastrzemski 
(3308), Hank Aaron (3076) and Stan Musial (3026) played more games for 
one franchise.[27] Robinson, a slow baserunner, also hit into four triple 
plays during his career, a major league record. He commented, "I wouldn't 
mind seeing someone erase my record of hitting into four triple plays."[28] 
He is the first player to start two triple plays in one season, as he did 
in 1973. When the Orioles started their team Hall of Fame, Brooks and Frank 
Robinson were the first two men inducted. Following his retirement as a 
player, Brooks began a successful career as a color commentator for the 
Orioles' television broadcasts. In 1982, local television WMAR's on-air 
news team in Baltimore, Maryland went on strike and picketed the WMAR headquarters 
for the two months approaching the baseball season. When Robinson refused 
to cross the picket line, WMAR management re-opened the negotiations and 
the strike ended the next day. At the conclusion of his final season in 
1977, his jersey number 5 was retired by the Orioles.[29] Robinson was 
elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1983, one of only 16 players to 
have been honored on the first ballot (not including the five charter members 
chosen in the first election in 1936).[4] Considered among the greatest 
all-time Orioles, Robinson and the man usually considered the greatest 
Baltimore Colts football player, Johnny Unitas, had plaques in their honor 
in the lobby of Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. When the Orioles played their 
last game there on October 6, 1991, Robinson and Unitas were invited to 
throw out the ceremonial first balls. (Unitas threw a football.) After 
the conclusion of the game, 119 former Oriole players took the field in 
the uniforms of their time and stood at their old positions on the field. 
Robinson was chosen to be the first player to come out.[30] In 1999, he 
ranked Number 80 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball 
Players, and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[31][32] 
A longtime supporter of Scouting, Robinson served for many years on the 
executive board of the Baltimore Area Council, Boy Scouts of America and 
is a recipient of the Silver Beaver Award. On December 5, 2006 he was recognized 
for his accomplishments on and off of the field when he received the Bobby 
Bragan Youth Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award. On May 16, 2007, Radio 
Tower Drive, a road in Pikesville, Maryland, was renamed Brooks Robinson 
Drive in honor of Robinson's 70th birthday.[33] On July 2, 2008, the minor 
league team in York, Pennsylvania, where Robinson got his start, held a 
ceremony honoring him for being voted as a member on the All-Time Rawlings 
Gold Glove Team.[34] The award was created by Rawlings and voted by fans 
to celebrate the golden anniversary of the award. On October 22, 2011, 
a statue was unveiled on Washington Boulevard in downtown Baltimore depicting 
Robinson preparing to throw out a runner at first base. Robinson was present 
for the unveiling of the statue and commented that it "gave him more hair 
than he deserved". The statue weighs more than 1,500 pounds, is dark gray 
in color with the exception of a gold colored fielders's baseball glove, 
and is located about 300 yards away from the Camden Yards statue of Babe 
Ruth.[35] On September 29, 2012, the Orioles unveiled a larger-than-life 
bronze sculpture of Robinson at Oriole Park at Camden Yards as part of 
the Orioles Legends Celebration Series during the 20th anniversary of the 
ballpark.[36][37] The unveiling had been previously scheduled to be on 
May 12, 2012, but had to be rescheduled due to Brooks still slowly recovering 
after falling off a stage on January 27, 2012.[38] In 2015, Robinson was 
selected as one of the Orioles Franchise-Four, recognizing the four greatest 
players in Orioles history, along with Jim Palmer, Frank Robinson and Cal 
Ripken Jr. Robinson serves as president of the Major League Baseball Players 
Alumni Association (MLBPAA), an organization that assists players and fans 
to interact off the field. MLB legends Bob Boone, George Brett, Chuck Hinton, 
Mike Hegan, Robin Yount, Rusty Staub, Carl Erskine and Al Kaline preside 
as vice presidents. The organization assists former major league players 
through its wholly owned for-profit organizations MLAM (Major League Alumni 
Marketing), and MLAS (Major League Alumni Services). MLAM's goals include 
implementing a player pool and gaining compensation for former players 
through appearances and endorsements while protecting the name and likeness 
of former players from unauthorized uses. Robinson is one of the investors 
in the Opening Day Partners group, which owns four teams in the Atlantic 
League of Professional Baseball. The group named the Brooks Robinson Plaza 
at the entrance of PeoplesBank Park in York, Pennsylvania in his honor. 
In the 1970s, Robinson published an autobiography entitled Third Base is 
My Home. He met his future wife, Constance Louise "Connie" Butcher,[7] 
on an Orioles team flight from Kansas City to Boston in July 1959, where 
she was working as a flight attendant for United Air Lines. He was so smitten 
with her that he kept ordering iced teas from her. Some of his teammates 
encouraged him to go talk to her.[8] After drinking his third glass, he 
returned it to her in the galley. There he told her: "I want to tell you 
something. If any of these guys, the Baltimore Orioles, ask you for a date, 
tell 'em you don't date married men. Understand? I'm the only single guy 
on the team." Before the plane landed in Boston the two had made a date 
to go out. He was not the only bachelor on the flight.[39] Brooks and Constance 
were married in her hometown of Windsor, Ontario, Canada on October 8, 
1960.[40] Raised a Methodist, in 1970 Robinson converted to Catholicism, 
his wife's faith.[41][42] On March 31, 2011, Robinson was admitted to Greater 
Baltimore Medical Center for emergency surgery after he developed an infection 
and fever.[43] In the two weeks he spent in the hospital, he received an 
outpouring of letters and well-wishes from fans around the country.[44] 
He had also previously been successfully treated for prostate cancer in 
2009. In April 2014 it was reported that Robinson was seeking a multimillion-dollar 
settlement with the Seminole Indian tribe related to injuries suffered 
by Robinson after a 2012 fall from a stage at the Hard Rock casino.[45]
