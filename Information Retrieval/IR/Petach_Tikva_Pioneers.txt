Home Away The Petach Tikva Pioneers (Hebrew: פתח תקווה פיונירס‎‎) was an 
Israeli baseball team from Petah Tikva in the Israel Baseball League. They 
finished the inaugural 2007 regular season in last place (9-32; .220), 
and lost to the Modi'in Miracle in the quarterfinals of the 2007 championship. 
The name for the Pioneers was chosen in recognition that Petah Tikva was 
founded in 1878 by religious pioneers from Jerusalem, who were led by Yehoshua 
Stampfer, Yoel Moshe Salomon, Zerach Brant, and David Gutmann, as well 
as Lithuanian Rabbi Aryeh Leib Frumkin. The first player selected by the 
Pioneers in the inaugural draft was Dominican outfielder Reynaldo Cruz,[1] 
who later suffered a concussion and did not play for the rest of the season. 
Ken Holtzman managed the Pioneers in the 2007 inaugural season of the Israel 
Baseball League, up until the last week of the season. Holtzman in his 
major league career was the only pitcher since the 1880s to throw 2 no-hitters 
for the Cubs, and his 174 career victories are the most in the major leagues 
by a Jewish pitcher. He also held the record for most pitching appearances 
by a Jewish pitcher until 1998. Located at the Yarkon Sports Complex in
