Wiping, also known as junking, is a colloquial term for action taken by 
radio and television production and broadcasting companies, in which old 
audiotapes, videotapes, and telerecordings (kinescopes), are erased, reused, 
or destroyed. Although the practice was once very common, especially in 
the 1960s and 1970s, wiping is now practiced much less frequently. Older 
video and audio formats took up much more storage space than modern digital 
video or audio files, making their retention more costly, thus increasing 
the incentive of discarding existing broadcast material to recover storage 
space for newer programmes. The advent of domestic audiovisual playback 
technology (e.g., videocassette and DVD) has made wiping less beneficial, 
with broadcasters and production houses realizing both the economic and 
cultural value of keeping archived material for both rebroadcast and potential 
profits through release on home video. Australian broadcasters did not 
gain access to videotape-recording technology until the early 1960s, and 
as a result nearly all programmes prior to that were broadcast live-to-air. 
Very little programming survives from the earliest years of Australian 
TV (1956–1960), as kinescope recording to film was expensive and most of 
what was recorded in this way has since been lost or destroyed. Some early 
programmes have survived, however; for example, ATN-7, a Sydney station, 
prerecorded (via kinescopes) some of their 1950s output such as Autumn 
Affair (1958–1959), The Pressure Pak Show (1957–1958) and Leave it to the 
Girls (1957–1958); some of these kinescopes have survived and are now held 
by the National Film and Sound Archive,[1][2][3] with soap opera Autumn 
Affair surviving near-intact, likely one of the earliest Australian series 
for which this is the case. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) 
erased much of its early output. Much of the videotaped ABC programme material 
from the 1960s and early 1970s was erased as part of an economy policy 
instituted in the late 1970s in which old programme tapes were surrendered 
for bulk erasure and reuse. This policy particularly targeted older programmes 
recorded in black-and-white, leading to the loss of many recordings made 
before 1975, when Australian television converted to colour. The ABC continued 
erasing older television output into the early 1980s. Programmes known 
to have been lost include most studio segments from the 1960s current affairs 
shows This Day Tonight and Monday Conference, hundreds of episodes of the 
long-running rural serial Bellbird, all but a handful of episodes of the 
early-1970s drama series Certain Women, an early-1970s miniseries of dramatizations 
based on Norman Lindsay's novels, and nearly all of the first 18 months 
of the weekly pop-music show Countdown. Many episodes of popular Australian 
commercial TV series are also lost. In the 1970s, Network Ten had an official 
policy to reuse tapes; hence, many tapes of Young Talent Time and Number 
96 were wiped. To this day, Network Ten still only keeps some of its programming.[citation 
needed] Other notable losses from the Ten archive include hundreds of episodes 
of the Melbourne-based pop music shows commissioned and broadcast by ATV-0 
Melbourne in the 1960s and early 1970s—The Go!! Show (1964–1967), Kommotion 
(1964–1967), Uptight (1968–70), and the Happening 70s series (1970–1972). 
The Nine Network discarded copies of some of their programs, including 
the popular GTV-9 series In Melbourne Tonight hosted by Graham Kennedy. 
Though it ran five nights a week from 1957 to 1970, fewer than 100 episodes 
are known to survive, and many of the surviving episodes are edited prints 
made for rebroadcast across Australia. Early episodes of Hey Hey It's Saturday 
do not exist because the programme was broadcast live and did not begin 
videotape recordings until a number of years later. From 1968–1969, TV 
Tupi produced new episodes of the soap opera Beto Rockfeller by recording 
over previous episodes; as a result, few episodes survive. After the closure 
of TV Tupi in 1980 the 536 tapes at its São Paulo studios were simply left 
to deteriorate until they were recovered in 1985 and subsequently restored 
by TV Cultura in 1989. Only two TV Tupi O&Os are known to have any preserved 
videotapes; TV Itacolomi's archives are now owned by the unrelated TV Alterosa, 
affiliated with SBT, whereas the few remaining tapes belonging to TV Piratini 
are stored privately in a museum in Porto Alegre, albeit in a deteriorated 
state. Rede Record also lost much footage from the 1960s due to wiping, 
fires, and deterioration; most of the MPB music festivals no longer exist, 
and the sitcom Família Trapo has only one surviving episode, featuring 
Pelé. Until 1997 Rede Record had no policy on archiving videotapes, since 
then at least 600 videotapes that were previously believed to be lost have 
been recovered. Rede Globo lost the first 35 broadcasts of both Fantástico 
and Jornal Nacional, in addition to many segments of their other soap operas, 
as a result of wiping, and also due to three fires that occurred in 1969, 
1971 and 1976, where an estimated 920 to 1500 tapes were destroyed. Most 
of Rede Excelsior's output was damaged in a fire in 1969; however, in the 
late 1990s about 100 tapes of Rede Excelsior programming were discovered 
and these tapes were subsequently donated to the Cinemateca Brasileira 
in 2001. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation never practiced wiping, 
and maintains a complete archive of all programming that was recorded.[4] 
The CTV Television Network has admitted to wiping many programmes during 
the 1970s. Because of Canadian content requirements, the need for Canadian-produced 
programming led to more preservation of the shows they produced, and even 
very poorly received programmes (such as the infamous The Trouble with 
Tracy) were saved and rerun for several years after their cancellation. 
Furthermore, Canadian rebroadcasts have been a source of some broadcasts 
that are otherwise lost in the United States and the United Kingdom. Some 
TV stations in Japan practiced wiping, this example included the first 
anime adaption of Doraemon. Episodes from 1979 to 1982 of the longest running 
noontime show, Eat Bulaga, have been lost. Another example of the wiping 
of TV archives in the Philippines was when martial law was declared, soldiers 
raided the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center and placed it under military control. 
As a result, ABS-CBN's pre-martial law archives, dating from 1953 to 1972, 
were lost. Due to its multiple studio facilities, namely its Chapultepec 
and San Angel studios, Televisa preserved most of its scripted series for 
broadcast years after the preserved programs had ended their original runs. 
Some Televisa programs, however, were lost not due to wiping, but due to 
the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that destroyed part of the network's archive. 
However, smaller channels, such as XEIPN-TV and XHDF-TV, did not began 
to preserve their recorded broadcasts until the early 1980s. The BBC, the 
United Kingdom's first public service broadcaster, had no policy on archiving 
until 1978.[5] Much of the corporation's output between the 1930s and 1980s 
has been lost. Rationales behind this policy include: The BBC's television 
service dates back to 1936 and was originally a nearly live-only medium. 
The hours of transmission were very limited and the bulk of the programming 
was transmitted either live from the studio, or from outside broadcast 
(OB) units; film was a minor contributor to the output. When the first 
television broadcasts were made, there were two competing systems in use. 
The EMI electronic system (using 405 lines) competed with the Baird 240-line 
mechanical television system. Baird adopted an intermediate film technique 
where the live material was filmed using a standard film camera mounted 
on a large cabinet which contained a rapid processing unit and an early 
flying spot scanner to produce the video output for transmission. The pioneer 
broadcasts were not, however, preserved on this intermediate film as the 
nitrate (celluloid) stock was scanned while still wet from the fixer bath 
and never washed to remove the fixer chemicals. Consequently, the film 
decomposed very soon after transmission; nothing is known to have survived. 
No studio or OB programmes from 1936 to 1939 or 1946 to 1947 have survived 
because there was no means of preserving them. Historical 'firsts' from 
this era; the world's earliest television crime drama Telecrime (1938–39 
and 1946) or Pinwright's Progress (1946–47, the world's first regular situation 
comedy), only remain visually as a handful of still photographs. The earliest 
recording method for television was telerecording, which involved recording 
the image from a special television monitor onto film with a modified film 
camera. Early examples made by this method include the first two episodes 
of The Quatermass Experiment (1953), transmitted live while simultaneously 
telerecorded. The visual quality of the second episode's recording was 
considered so poor—a fly entered the gap between the camera and monitor 
at one point—that the remainder of the series was not recorded. Although 
Quadruplex videotape recording technology was utilised in the UK from 1958, 
this system was expensive and complex; recorded programmes were often erased 
after broadcast. The vast majority of live programmes were never recorded 
at all. Videotape was not initially thought to be a permanent archivable 
medium – its high cost and the potential reuse of the tapes led to the 
transfer of programme material to film via telerecording whenever sales 
of overseas screening rights were possible or preservation deemed worthwhile. 
The recycling of videotapes, coupled with savings made on the storage of 
the bulky 2" tapes,[6] enabled the BBC to keep costs down. Drama and entertainment 
output was studio-based and followed the tradition of live theatre. Conventional 
filmmaking was only gradually introduced from the 1960s. The Sunday Night 
Play (a major event in the 1950s) was performed live in the studio. On 
Thursday, because telerecording was of insufficient broadcast quality, 
another live performance followed, the artists returning to perform the 
play again. Today, most programmes are pre-recorded and it is relatively 
inexpensive to preserve programming for posterity; even so, the BBC Charter 
makes no mention of any obligation to retain all of them. All television 
programmes have copyright and other rights issues associated with them. 
For some genres of programmes—such as drama and entertainment—the actors, 
writers, and musicians involved in a production all have underlying rights. 
In the past, these rights were defended rigorously—permission could even 
be denied by a contributor for the repeat or re-use of a programme. Talent 
unions were highly suspicious of the threat to new work if programmes were 
repeated; indeed, before 1955 Equity insisted that any telerecording made 
(of a repeat performance) could only "be viewed privately" on BBC premises 
and not transmitted. The introduction of colour television in the United 
Kingdom from 1967 meant that broadcasters felt there was even less value 
in retaining monochrome recordings. Such tapes could not be re-used for 
colour production, so they were disposed of to create space for the new 
colour tapes in the archives, which were quickly filling up. The increased 
cost of colour 2 inch Quadruplex videotape—approximately £1000 per tape 
at today's prices—meant that companies still often re-used the tapes for 
efficiency. Negative attitudes to a programme's value also persisted. For 
these reasons, many programmes survive only as monochrome film recordings, 
if at all. Some colour productions were telerecorded onto monochrome film 
for export to countries which did not yet have colour television. In some 
cases, early colour programmes only survive in this form. High-profile 
examples of programme losses include many early episodes of Doctor Who 
(97), The Wednesday Play, most of the seminal comedy series Not Only But 
Also, all of the 1950s televised Francis Durbridge serials (further, the 
first two serials were never recorded), the vast majority of the BBC's 
Apollo 11 Moon landing studio coverage, all but one of the 39 episodes 
of The First Lady,[7] and all 147 episodes of the soap opera United!. There 
are many gaps in many long-running BBC series (Dixon of Dock Green, Hancock's 
Half Hour, Sykes, Out of the Unknown, and Z-Cars). The Beatles' only live 
appearance on Top Of The Pops in 1966, performing the single "Paperback 
Writer" is believed to have been wiped clean in a clear-out in the 1970s. 
The first acting appearance of musician Bob Dylan, in a 1963 play entitled 
The Madhouse on Castle Street, was erased in 1968.[8] There is lost material 
in all genres — as late as 1993, a large number of videotaped children's 
programmes from the 1970s and 1980s were irretrievably wiped by Adam Lee 
of the BBC archives on the assumption that they were of "no use", without 
consulting the BBC children's department itself.[9] Virtually the entire 
runs of the corporation's pre-1970s soap operas have been lost. In the 
1950s and 1960s, the BBC soap operas The Appleyards, The Grove Family, 
Compact, The Newcomers, 199 Park Lane, and United! produced approximately 
1200 episodes altogether. There are no episodes of either United! or 199 
Park Lane in the archives, while only one episode of The Appleyards, three 
episodes of The Grove Family, and four episodes each of Compact and The 
Newcomers are known to exist. Also vulnerable to the corporation's wiping 
policy were programmes that only lasted for one season. Abigail and Roger, 
The Airbase, As Good Cooks Go, the 1960 adaptation of The Citadel, the 
1956 adaptation of David Copperfield, The Dark Island, The Gnomes of Dulwich, 
Hurricane, For Richer...For Poorer, Hereward the Wake, The Naked Lady, 
Night Train To Surbiton, Outbreak of Murder, Where do I Sit?, and Witch 
Hunt have all been wiped with no footage surviving while four out of seven 
episodes of the paranormal anthology series Dead of Night were wiped. An 
edition of Hugh and I ("Chinese Crackers"), starring Hugh Lloyd, Terry 
Scott, John Le Mesurier and David Jason was located by Kaleidoscope Publishing 
in 2010 in the archives of UCLA, and brought to general public attention 
in February 2011. Early episodes of the pop music-chart show Top of the 
Pops were wiped or never recorded while they were being transmitted live, 
including the only in-studio appearance by The Beatles. Clips of the Beatles 
miming "Can't Buy Me Love" and "You Can't Do That" on an episode from 25 
March 1964 were found online by missing episode hunter Ray Langstone in 
2015. The last lost edition dates from 8 September 1977. There are only 
four complete TOTP episodes surviving from the 1960s, while many otherwise-missing 
episodes survive only as fragments. Only two episodes still exist of The 
Sandie Shaw Supplement (a music-variety show hosted by the singer), recorded 
in 1967. Since the establishment of an archival policy for television in 
1978, BBC archivists and others over the years have used various contacts 
in the UK and abroad to try to track down missing programmes. For example, 
all BBC Worldwide customers—broadcasters around the world—who had bought 
programmes from the corporation were contacted to see if they still had 
copies which could be returned; Doctor Who is a prime example of how this 
method recovered episodes that the corporation did not hold itself. At 
the turn of the 21st century, the BBC established its Archive Treasure 
Hunt, a public appeal to recover lost productions, which has had some successes.[10] 
The BBC also has close contacts with the National Film and Television Archive, 
which is part of the British Film Institute and its "Missing Believed Wiped" 
event which was first held in 1993 and is part of a campaign to locate 
lost items from British television's past. There is also a network of collectors 
who, if they find any programmes missing from the BBC archives, will contact 
the corporation with information—or sometimes even the actual footage. 
Some examples of programmes recovered for the archives are Doctor Who, 
Steptoe and Son, Dad's Army, Letter from America,[11] The Likely Lads, 
and Play for Today. For many years the pilot episode of Are You Being Served? 
survived only in black and white, appearing in this form on the 2003 DVD 
release of the show. In 2009, a colour version was reconstructed when it 
was realised that the black and white film reel had actually recorded sufficient 
colour information as a dot crawl pattern to allow colour recovery. The 
BBC was not alone in this practice – the commercial companies that formed 
its main rival ITV also wiped videotapes and destroyed telerecordings, 
leaving gaps in their archive holdings. The state of the archives varies 
greatly between the different companies; Granada Television holds a large 
number of its older black-and-white programmes, the company having an unofficial 
policy of retaining as much of its broadcast material (albeit by telerecording) 
as possible despite financial hardship in its early years. This includes 
the entirety of the soap opera Coronation Street which is now held at the 
Yorkshire Television archive, which itself possesses largely intact archives, 
although some early colour shows from the late 1960s and the early 1970s 
such as the entire output of the drama Castle Haven, the first two series 
of Sez Les and the children's variety show Junior Showtime are missing 
and believed wiped. The former ITV company Thames Television also has a 
significant library. These cases tend to be the exception, however; the 
former nature of the ITV network, in which private independent companies 
were awarded licences to serve geographical areas for a set period of time, 
meant that when companies lost their licences their archives were often 
sold to third parties and became fragmented—and/or risked being destroyed, 
as ownership and copyright remained with the production companies rather 
than with the network. The archive of networked programmes made by Southern 
Television, for example, is now owned by the otherwise-unconnected Australian 
media company Southern Star Group but Southern's regional output is in 
the hands of ITV plc. The few surviving tapes of Associated-Rediffusion 
belong to many different organisations as the majority of Associated-Rediffusion's 
tapes were recorded in monochrome and therefore deemed of no use upon the 
arrival of colour broadcasting; as such they were disposed of by London 
successor Thames Television), although in recent years there have been 
occasional discoveries such as a 1959 episode of Double Your Money and 
the remaining missing episode of Around the World with Orson Welles, found 
by Ray Langstone in 2011. Many master tapes belonging to ATV have since 
deteriorated due to bad storage and are unsuitable for broadcasting. In 
particular, the ATV version of the popular soap Crossroads is missing 2,850 
episodes of its original 3,555. Also often largely lost are quiz shows; 
few editions exist of the 1970s version of Celebrity Squares with Bob Monkhouse, 
or Southern's children's quiz Runaround. Further, responsibility for archive 
preservation was left to individual companies. For example, ITV has no 
record of its live coverage of the 1969 Moon landings after the station 
responsible for providing the coverage, London Weekend Television, wiped 
the tapes. Of the 96 British inserts to the 1980s franchised Anglo-American-Canadian 
children's show Fraggle Rock, only 12 are known to exist as the library 
of the British producer (TVS) has been sold and subsequently split up. 
In recent years, the trend of preserving material has started to change. 
The archives of Westward Television and Television South West are now held 
in trust for the public as the South West Film and Television Archive, 
whilst changes in legislation mean that ITV companies which lose their 
franchises must donate archives to the British Film Institute. However, 
the change of ITV from a federal structure to one centralised company means 
that changes of regional companies in the future seems highly unlikely. 
Most material from the 1960s also only survive as telerecordings. Some 
early episodes are also believed to be damaged or in poor quality, whereas 
much of the output of other broadcasters – such as many early episodes 
of The Avengers which were shot in the electronic studio rather than on 
film, produced by Associated British Corporation – have been destroyed. 
No copies of The Adventures of Francie & Josie exist, as most of Scottish 
Television's early shows were destroyed in a fire in late 1969 (although 
some sources state 1973). The Adventures Of Francie & Josie was made from 
1961 to 1965 by STV. Since the BBC library was first audited in 1978, missing 
programmes or extracts on either film or tape are often found in unexpected 
places. An appeal to broadcasters in other countries who had shown missing 
programmes (notably Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and African nations 
such as Nigeria) produced "missing" episodes from the archives of those 
television companies. Episodes have also been returned to broadcasters 
by private film collectors who had acquired 16mm film copies from various 
sources. Copies of several compilations from the British 1960s comedy At 
Last The 1948 Show, held by many to be a forerunner of Monty Python's Flying 
Circus, were discovered in the archives of the Swedish broadcaster SVT, 
to whom the producers Rediffusion London had sold them upon the companies' 
loss of its broadcasting licence. The master tapes, along with much of 
Rediffusion's programming, were wiped or disposed of by London successor 
Thames Television. Their recovery enabled the reconstruction of otherwise 
missing original editions of the programme, meaning most of the series 
exists in visual form. Off-air home audio recordings of various television 
programmes have also been recovered, at least preserving the soundtracks 
to otherwise missing shows, and some of these (particularly from Doctor 
Who) have been released on CD by the BBC following restoration and the 
addition of narration to describe purely visual elements. Tele-snaps, a 
commercial service of off-screen shots of programmes often purchased by 
actors and television directors to keep a record of their work in the days 
before videocassette recorders, have also been recovered for many lost 
programmes. Advances in technology have resulted in old programmes being 
transferred to new digital media, where they can be restored or (if they 
are damaged or otherwise cannot be restored) kept from decaying further. 
In the United Kingdom, the archives of both the BBC and those available 
of ITV, along with other channels, are being switched from cumbersome 2-inch 
quadruplex videotape to digital format. This is an extensive and expensive 
process and one that will take many years to complete. Live broadcasts 
in Britain are still not necessarily kept, and wiping of material has not 
ceased. According to writer and broadcaster Matthew Sweet, there are "big 
gaps in the record of children's television of the Nineties."[13] In the 
United States, the major broadcast networks also engaged in the practice 
of wiping recordings until the late 1970s. Many episodes were erased, especially 
daytime and late-night programming such as daytime soap operas and game 
shows. The daytime shows, almost all of them having been taped, were erased 
because it was believed at the time that nobody wanted to see them after 
their first broadcast. The success of cable television networks devoted 
to reruns of these genres proved that this was not the case, as the large 
number of episodes that were required for a daily program made even a short-run 
game show an ideal candidate for syndication. By this time, however, the 
damage had already been done. Some museums and other cultural institutions 
such as the Paley Center for Media have taken steps to discover and preserve 
(see, e.g., "Paley Center for Media#Archives") old recordings previously 
thought to have been wiped or discarded, lost, or misfiled. Hosting sequences 
on videotape, nearly always featuring celebrities, were sometimes made 
for telecasts of family films, notably for the first nine telecasts of 
MGM's The Wizard of Oz. It is not known if those made for Oz survived since 
they have not been seen since 1967. One hosting sequence from that era 
that does survive is the one Eddie Albert made for the 1965 CBS telecast 
of The Nutcracker, starring Edward Villella, Patricia McBride, and Melissa 
Hayden. It has even been included on the DVD release of the program.[14] 
Many of Ernie Kovacs's videotaped network programs were also wiped. During 
different times as comedian, writer, and performer Kovacs had programs 
on all four major television networks (ABC, CBS, DuMont, and NBC). After 
Kovacs's death, the networks wiped many programs. Kovacs's widow Edie Adams 
obtained as many programs and episodes as she could find, donating them 
to UCLA's Special Collections. Though most soap operas transitioned from 
live broadcast to videotaping their shows during the 1960s, it was still 
common practice to wipe and reuse the tapes. This practice was due to the 
high cost of videotape at the time. While soap operas began routinely saving 
their episodes between 1976 and 1979, several soaps have saved recordings 
of most or all their episodes. Days of Our Lives has recordings of all 
its episodes; its first two episodes of exist on their original master 
tapes, and were aired by SOAPnet in 2005. The Young and the Restless, Dark 
Shadows and Ryan's Hope saved most of their episodes, despite the fact 
that they debuted during the 1960s and 1970s, before retaining tapes became 
common practice. Episodes of The Doctors began to be saved no later than 
December 4, 1967; this is where reruns of the series began when picked 
up by Retro Television Network in September 2014. Episodes of other soaps 
broadcast during the 1950s to 1970s do exist in different forms and have 
been showcased in various places online. Procter and Gamble started saving 
their shows around 1979. Very few pre-1979 color episodes of the Procter 
and Gamble-sponsored shows survive, with most extant episodes preserved 
as monochrome kinescopes. Exceptions include two episodes of The Guiding 
Light (1973 and 1977), which have been released on DVD. As the World Turns 
and The Edge of Night aired live until 1975, the year The Edge of Night 
moved to ABC and As the World Turns expanded from a 30-minute broadcast 
to one hour. Both shows began taping episodes in preparation for the move 
of The Edge of Night to ABC. The Edge of Night's ABC debut is believed 
to have survived. Overall, the number of surviving monochrome episodes 
recorded on kinescope outnumber color episodes for these programs. Agnes 
Nixon initially produced her series One Life to Live and All My Children 
through her own production company, Creative Horizons, Inc., and kept a 
complete archive of monochrome kinescopes until ABC bought the shows from 
her in 1975. When the network wanted to expand All My Children from 30 
minutes to a full hour in the late 1970s, Nixon agreed on the condition 
that the network would begin saving the episodes. ABC complied, and full 
hour broadcasts began on April 25, 1977. However, a fire destroyed the 
vast majority of the early-1970s kinescopes, leaving only a few random 
episodes from each season. Virtually all episodes of General Hospital, 
from its premiere in April 1963 through August 1970, are archived at UCLA. 
The UCLA Film & Television Archive holds a large number of daytime television 
airings that were spared from the wiping practice. Also archived there 
are handfuls of episodes of each soap opera that was on the air from 1971 
and 1973, including A World Apart, Where the Heart Is, and Return to Peyton 
Place. It is believed that virtually the entire archive of the DuMont Television 
Network, covering its whole history from 1946 to 1956, was disposed of 
during the 1970s by a "successor" broadcaster (presumably Metromedia, the 
holder of DuMont's assets), who dumped all of the kinescopes/videotapes 
into the East River to make room for other tapes (believed to be ABC's) 
at a New York City warehouse.[15] Further, a large number of DuMont's kinescopes 
were destroyed in about 1958 for their silver content. Of the over 20,000 
shows carried by DuMont in its ten-year existence, approximately 350 or 
so episodes of DuMont programming are known to exist today, less than two 
percent of its total output. The remainder were either never recorded (e.g., 
NFL on DuMont) or were dumped in the earlier purges. Almost all of The 
Tonight Show with Jack Paar and the first ten years hosted by his successor 
Johnny Carson were taped over by the network, with Carson's blessing, under 
the assumption that the broadcasts were of no real value.[16] This is part 
of the reason why Carson's late 1960s shows had poorer picture quality[citation 
needed] compared to his competitor Dick Cavett on ABC; NBC was using the 
Tonight Show tapes repeatedly. Another reason for their poorer quality 
is that many of the 1960s Tonight Show episodes only survived in the kinescope 
format. (Cavett's ABC shows were also taped over by his network in favor 
of other shows produced at ABC's studios in New York.) Many early sporting 
events, such as the World Series and the first two Super Bowls, were also 
lost, though a nearly intact recording of the first Super Bowl was found 
in 2005. Super Bowl I was aired by both CBS and NBC (the only Super Bowl 
to be aired by two networks), but neither network felt the need to preserve 
the game long-term; CBS saved the telecast for a few months and reran it 
as filler programming at least once before wiping it. A color videotape 
containing the first, second and fourth quarters of the telecast from WYOU 
(the CBS affiliate for Scranton, Pennsylvania) was found in 2005 and is 
in the process of being restored.[17] On January 15, 2016, the NFL Network 
reaired the first Super Bowl, featuring audio from NBC Radio and most of 
the TV network broadcast and newly discovered NFL Films footage of the 
game. Super Bowl II was aired exclusively by CBS and was believed to have 
been erased, but it was later found that the entire telecast fully exists 
and rests in the vaults of NFL Films.[18] Though the telecast of Super 
Bowl III exists in full color, only half of the Super Bowl IV broadcast 
does (the rest was preserved by Canadian television in black-and-white). 
The first three quarters of Super Bowl V broadcast by NBC Los Angeles affiliate 
KNBC exist, but the fourth quarter is missing, though the Mike Curtis interception 
and Jim O'Brien game-winning field goal were recovered via news highlights 
from CBC. Super Bowl VI also exists in its entirety. It was not until Super 
Bowl VII that a continuous archive was established.[18] Similarly, all 
of the telecasts of the NFL Championship Games prior to the Super Bowl 
are believed to have been lost, with all surviving footage of those games 
coming from separately produced film. The status of most regular season 
and playoff games from the early years of television up to the immediate 
years following the 1970 AFL–NFL merger are also unknown. Among the footage 
that has survived include at least some of NBC's coverage from the 1972 
AFC Divisional Playoff game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Oakland 
Raiders that featured the Immaculate Reception, as well as the inaugural 
telecast of Monday Night Football between the Cleveland Browns and the 
New York Jets, though several Monday Night Football games in the ensuing 
seasons were lost. A 1974 game that featured John Lennon being interviewed 
by Howard Cosell in the booth only survived due to a home video recording 
of the game; the game itself was wiped by ABC. CBS kept coverage of a 1978 
matchup between the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles that would 
feature the now-infamous Miracle at the Meadowlands, although the existence 
of many 1978 games on CBS by private collectors shows that the networks 
by that point started keeping recordings of regular season games. There 
are rare exceptions of CBS games from 1977 back, but by 1978 the library 
of most teams is almost fully complete. NBC is another story. The NFL had 
its own filmmakers, NFL Films, filming the game with its own equipment. 
Thus, preserving the telecasts on tape was not seen as a priority by the 
networks when another source was available – though the sportscasters' 
play-by-play comments, as a result, were lost. All telecasts of World Series 
games starting in 1975 (Reds–Red Sox) are known to exist in full.[19] Follows 
is the known footage of World Series telecasts prior to 1975: For the League 
Championship Series telecasts spanning from 1969 to 1975, only Game 2 of 
the 1972 American League Championship Series (Oakland–Detroit) is known 
to exist;[19] however, the copy on the trade circuit is missing the Bert 
Campaneris–Lerrin LaGrow brawl. There are some instances where the only 
brief glimpse of telecast footage of an early LCS game can be seen in a 
surviving newscast from that night. While all telecasts of World Series 
games starting with 1975 are accounted for and exist, the LCS is still 
a spotty situation through the late 1970s: Many programs in the early days 
of television were live broadcasts that are lost because they were not 
recorded. Most prime-time programs that were preserved used the kinescope 
recording process, which involved filming the live broadcast from a television 
screen using a motion-picture camera (videotape, for recording programs, 
was not perfected until the late 1950s and was not widely used until the 
late 1960s). This was also a common practice for broadcasting live TV shows 
to the west coast, as performers often performed a show back-to-back, but 
never back-to-back-to-back. Daytime programs, however, were generally not 
kinescoped for preservation (although many were temporarily kinescoped 
for later broadcast, episodes recorded in this way were often junked). 
Many local station and network newscasts were prone to wiping. Some early 
news programs, such as Camel News Caravan, are largely lost. Moving images 
of Walter Cronkite reading the news in his studio every night for six years 
are gone with the exception of his coverage of the Cuban Missile Crisis 
in 1962 and the JFK assassination in 1963. Studio shots of Peter Jennings 
inside his ABC studio during his first year there (1965) are also gone. 
Vanderbilt University has kept all evening national news telecasts since 
Monday, August 5, 1968. As of 1997, CBS had saved 1,000,000 videotapes 
of news reports, broadcasts, stock footage, and outtakes according to a 
report that year from the National Film Preservation Board. The same report 
added, "Television stations still erase and recycle their video cassettes", 
referring to local news programs.[22] Many local stations contract with 
outside companies for archiving news coverage. Little of the first sitcom, 
The Mary Kay and Johnny Show, remains today. It was initially live and 
not recorded, but later in its run kinescopes were made for rebroadcasting. 
Fragments of episodes and one complete installment are known to exist. 
Game shows, more than any other genre, were prone to wiping. Many games 
between 1941 and 1980 had insignificantly-short runs (some measured in 
a span of weeks or even days) that the networks felt it unnecessary to 
keep them for posterity, whereas recycling the tapes would be more profitable 
and less of an effort than attempting to sell the series in reruns, in 
an era before cable television. Mark Goodson–Bill Todman Productions (and 
to a lesser extent, Barry-Enright Productions and Chuck Barris Productions) 
and to an even lesser extent Heatter-Quigley Productions had the foresight 
to preserve many of their games for later reruns; for years, these shows 
dominated the Game Show Network (GSN) line-up and now make up a major portion 
of Buzzr TV's lineup. Most other game shows from that era were not so fortunate. 
All of the Bob Stewart, Heatter–Quigley except for PDQ which aired in syndication 
as well as many episodes of Hollywood Squares, Hatos–Hall (except for a 
large portion of Let's Make a Deal), and pre-1980 Merv Griffin productions 
have been destroyed, with the exception of a few rare pilots and "cast 
aside" episodes. The few remaining episodes have therefore become collectors' 
items, and an active trading circuit exists among collectors. NBC and ABC 
continued the wiping process well into the 1970s; while ABC ceased in early 
1978, NBC continued to wipe some shows into 1980, leaving much of their 
daytime game show content lost forever. CBS abandoned the wiping process 
by September 1972, largely as a result of their collaboration with Goodson-Todman; 
as a result, even the network's shorter-lived games (such as Spin-Off) 
still exist in their entirety. Incidentally, all three networks ended their 
wiping practices during the time Fred Silverman led their respective networks. 
While it remained in business, DuMont wished to keep its programs as intact 
as possible. However, the network ceased to exist in 1956 and its archive 
was destroyed in the 1970s. The corporate successor to DuMont, Fox, not 
only has never aired any daytime programming (other than its Fox Kids block 
from 1990 to 2001) but debuted in 1986, well beyond the wiping era. Several 
award shows from the 1950s and 1960s, such as the Academy Awards and the 
Emmy Awards, only survive in kinescope format. From 1957 to 1965, the Academy 
Awards were taped in black and white, but only survive in kinescope format 
for overseas distribution, especially for the European TV audiences, which 
used another system (625 lines as opposed to 525 lines), as the tapes used 
for late broadcasting were reused. All of the taped broadcasts of the Oscars
