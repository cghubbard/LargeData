As player As manager Edwin Lee "Eddie" Mathews (October 13, 1931 – February 
18, 2001) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) third baseman.[1] 
He played 17 seasons for the Boston Braves, Milwaukee Braves, Atlanta Braves, 
Houston Astros, and Detroit Tigers, from 1952 through 1968.[1] Mathews 
was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978.[2] Mathews 
is regarded as one of the best third basemen ever to play the game.[3][4] 
He was an All-Star for 9 seasons[5]. He won the National League (NL) home 
run title in 1953 and 1959 and was the NL Most Valuable Player runner-up 
both of those seasons. He hit 512 home runs during his major league career. 
Mathews coached for the Atlanta Braves in 1971, and he was the team's manager 
from 1972 to 1974.[6] Later, he was a scout and coach for the Texas Rangers, 
Milwaukee Brewers, and Oakland Athletics.[6] Mathews was born in Texarkana, 
Texas. He was six years old when his family moved to Santa Barbara, California. 
The Santa Barbara High School baseball field, where he developed into a 
star high school baseball player, is named after him. Mathews was signed 
by the Boston Braves in 1949. He played 63 games that year for the Class 
D High Point-Thomasville Hi-Toms, where he hit 17 home runs and earned 
a .363 batting average. The next year he hit 32 home runs for the Class 
AA Atlanta Crackers.[7] Mathews was brought up to the major leagues in 
1952, Mathews hit 25 home runs, including three in one game. In 1953 the 
Braves moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin where he batted .302, hit 47 home 
runs, and drove in 135 runs. For nine straight seasons he hit at least 
30 home runs, including leading the National League twice (1953, 1959). 
As one of 1954's superstars in American sports, Mathews was chosen for 
the cover of the first-ever issue of Sports Illustrated magazine. Around 
this time, Ty Cobb said of Mathews: "I've only known three or four perfect 
swings in my time. This lad has one of them." Mathews was a powerful pull 
hitter, and for many years of his career teams would implement the "Mathews 
shift" when he came to bat. The second baseman would shift well to his 
left, toward first base, and the shortstop would come to the second base 
side of the bag, leaving a gaping hole between second and third base. Mathews 
delighted in occasionally punching the ball through that hole. The Braves 
won the 1957 National League championship. In the World Series, Mathews 
hit a game-winning home run in the tenth inning of game four. The Braves 
went on to defeat the New York Yankees to win the Series. Mathews made 
the final putout of the Series, a forceout of Gil McDougald on Moose Skowron's 
hard-hit grounder. Mathews was regarded as one of the strongest power hitters 
of his time, often being compared to American League contemporary Mickey 
Mantle, in terms of power hitting strength. Hall-of-Fame teammate Warren 
Spahn once said of the two: "Mathews is just as strong as Mantle. They 
don't hit the same – Mantle gets all of his weight into his swing; Mathews 
uses his wrists more." Spahn's comment on Mathews' use of his wrists was 
in reference to his unique swing, as believed by many to be one of the 
more graceful swings in baseball history.[citation needed] He is the only 
player to play for the Braves in Boston, Milwaukee, and Atlanta. Mathews 
is also one of only two players to homer with a teammate in the same game 
at least 50 times with two different teammates. He did this with Henry 
Aaron 75 times and with Joe Adcock 56 times.[8] Willie Mays is the other, 
with Willie McCovey (68) and Orlando Cepada (50), to do it. Between 1954 
and 1966 he and Braves teammate Hank Aaron hit 863 home runs (Aaron 442, 
Mathews 421), moving ahead of the Yankees duo of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig 
as the all-time leaders in major league history. Mathews was traded to 
the Houston Astros before the 1967 season. That year, he became the seventh 
player to hit 500 career home runs, becoming a member of the 500 home run 
club coming off pitcher Juan Marichal of the San Francisco Giants. During 
the 1967 season, Mathews was traded from the Astros to the Detroit Tigers. 
His final appearances came in two games of the 1968 World Series, as the 
Tigers defeated the St. Louis Cardinals. Upon his retirement, he was sixth 
in all-time home runs with 512. Over his career, he was named to the All-Star 
team twelve times (MLB held two All-Star Games from 1959 through 1962),[9] 
played in three World Series, and drove in 100 or more runs five times. 
He never won an MVP award (finishing second twice, behind Roy Campanella 
in 1953 and behind Ernie Banks in 1959), although he did win the NL Player 
of the Month award in September 1959 (.303, 11 HR, 25 RBI). In 1971, Mathews 
became a coach, and then late in season of 1972, the manager of the Atlanta 
Braves.[6] Mathews is one of the few players to play, coach, and manage 
for the same baseball team. Mathews finished 23-27 as manager in 1972. 
The Braves finished fifth in 1973, 22 1⁄2 games out of first place.[10] 
Mathews was the Braves manager when Hank Aaron hit his 715th home run on 
April 8, 1974. In July 1974, Mathews was fired when the team went into 
a slump and fell into fourth place with a 50-49 record. Aaron and Darrell 
Evans both criticized the decision to terminate Mathews. Evans said that 
Mathews was a friend and Aaron said that the decision was "a blow to me."[10] 
Mathews said that the Braves indicated that there would be a job for him 
within the organization, but he said he was not sure what he would do next.[11] 
Mathews was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1976. In 
1978, Mathews was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He ranks 
second all-time among MLB third basemen in home runs, runs batted in, slugging 
percentage, and total bases. In 1982, Mathews was a minor league baseball 
instructor for the Oakland Athletics when a spot was found on his lung. 
He was ultimately admitted to the hospital to investigate it. Doctors ruled 
out cancer, but Mathews was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was treated 
and returned to his work with the Oakland organization.[12] In 1999, The 
Sporting News ranked Mathews 63 on their list of 100, "Baseball's Greatest 
Players".[13] He also nominated that year as a finalist for the Major League 
Baseball All-Century Team. Mathews was married to Virjean Lauby in 1954 
and they divorced in 1970. He was married and divorced a second time, then 
married Elizabeth Busch Burke, daughter of brewing executive Gussie Busch, 
in 1977.[14][15] Sportswriter Bob Wolf of the Milwaukee Journal indicated 
that Mathews' election to the Baseball Hall of Fame may have been delayed 
because of his cool relationship with the media. Mathews seemed to resent 
the intrusion of reporters in his personal life, especially early in his 
career. He gestured with his fist at a reporter when he was in court on 
charges of reckless driving. He was angered by the presence of the media 
at his 1954 wedding ceremony at a county clerk's office.[14] In February 
2001, Mathews died from complications of pneumonia in La Jolla, California, 
and was buried in Santa Barbara Cemetery. Later that year during the baseball 
season, the Atlanta Braves honored Mathews with the placement of patches 
bearing his retired uniform number, 41, on their jerseys. Italics denotes
