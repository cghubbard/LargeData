Francisco Cervelli (born March 6, 1986) is an Italian Venezuelan professional 
baseball catcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Previously, he played in MLB for the New York Yankees. The Yankees signed 
Cervelli as an international free agent in 2003. He made his MLB debut 
with the Yankees in 2008, and he played on the 2009 World Series championship 
team. He also played in the 2009 World Baseball Classic for the Italian 
national team. He was acquired by the Pirates on November 12, 2014. Francisco 
Cervelli was born on March 6, 1986 in Valencia, Venezuela to an Italian 
immigrant father and a Venezuelan mother. He also has a sister. In Venezuela, 
Cervelli played shortstop, second base, and sometimes pitched. The Yankees 
signed him as an international free agent with the understanding that he 
would try catching.[1] Cervelli played in the Dominican Summer League in 
2003. Initially a switch hitter, the Yankees had Cervelli focus on right-handed 
hitting.[citation needed] After struggling to adjust to professional baseball 
in 2004 and 2005, Cervelli batted .309 for the Staten Island Yankees of 
the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League in 2006. In 2007, he played 
for the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, where 
he batted .279 with an on-base percentage of .387 and two home runs. Baseball 
America rated him the Yankees' 23rd-best prospect prior to the 2008 season. 
On March 8, 2008, Cervelli fractured his wrist on a controversial play 
during a spring training game against the Tampa Bay Rays, when Rays infielder 
Elliot Johnson collided with him at home plate in the ninth inning. Joe 
Girardi, the Yankees manager said, "I think it was uncalled for, it's spring 
training and you are going to get people hurt and we got Cervelli hurt."[2] 
He didn't return to action until June 2008.[citation needed] Cervelli began 
the 2009 season with the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League.[citation 
needed] Following the completion of the 2008 minor league season, Cervelli 
was called up to the Yankees. He made his major league debut on September 
18, 2008, as a defensive replacement. He went 0–5 in his brief time in 
the majors. After starting the 2009 season in the minors, Cervelli was 
called up by the Yankees on May 5, 2009, when Jorge Posada was placed on 
the 15-day disabled list, though he was batting only .190, with a .266 
on-base percentage and .310 slugging percentage at Trenton at the time 
of the call-up, and had not played in Class AAA. He made his first major 
league start on May 7, after José Molina injured his quad. He recorded 
his first major league hit, a single, on May 8, against the Baltimore Orioles, 
while also catching starting pitcher CC Sabathia during a complete game 
shutout. Cervelli asserted himself as a reliable defensive catcher for 
the New York Yankees, and has received substantial praise from his teammates.[3] 
Though Cervelli was sent to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Class 
AAA International League on July 8, 2009 when Molina was activated off 
of the disabled list, Yankees' manager Joe Girardi made clear that he was 
impressed with Cervelli's performance.[4] Cervelli, much like Posada, does 
not use batting gloves, being one of the remaining few who do not wear 
them.[5] On June 24, 2009, Cervelli hit his first major league home run 
against Kris Medlen of the Atlanta Braves, breaking up a no-hitter. On 
September 16, 2009, Cervelli had his first walk-off hit – a single in the 
bottom of the ninth inning against the Toronto Blue Jays. Cervelli was 
a member of the Yankees roster in the 2009 MLB postseason, as the Yankees 
won the 2009 World Series.[citation needed] Cervelli started the 2010 season 
on the Yankees' 25-man roster to serve as the backup catcher to Posada, 
and served as the Yankees' starting catcher while Posada recovered from 
a foot injury.[6] On March 6, 2010, Cervelli was hit in the head by a pitch. 
He was removed from the game with a concussion. Shortly after, citing another 
concussion Cervelli suffered while playing winter ball, the Yankees suggested 
he begin wearing the Rawlings S-100 protective helmet, a bulkier model 
made to withstand 100 mph fastballs. This briefly earned him the nickname 
"Gazoo", a reference to a character in the The Flintstones.[7] In 2011, 
Cervelli entered spring training as the backup to Russell Martin.[8] Cervelli 
broke his foot in early March, and missed the beginning of the 2011 season.[9] 
On April 29, 2011, the New York Yankees activated Cervelli from the DL, 
replacing Gustavo Molina who was optioned to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.[10] 
On May 8, Cervelli hit his first home run of the season, his first career 
grand slam in a series tiebreaker on the road against Texas, bringing in 
Posada, Nick Swisher, and Brett Gardner.[11] Cervelli was optioned to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
to begin the 2012 season, with Chris Stewart winning the job as Martin's 
backup.[12] Cervelli admitted that he moped following the demotion, until 
his parents visited him during the season and refocused him on improving 
his game.[13] The Yankees recalled Cervelli to the majors when rosters 
expanded on September 1.[14] With Martin having signed with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, Cervelli became the starting catcher for the Yankees in 2013.[13] 
In a game against the Blue Jays on April 26, Cervelli suffered a fractured 
right hand after getting hit by a foul tip by outfielder Rajai Davis, he 
then underwent surgery the next day and was placed on the 60-day disabled 
list.[15] On August 5, 2013, Cervelli was suspended for 50 games after 
being linked with the Biogenesis scandal.[16] Cervelli competed with John 
Ryan Murphy and Austin Romine to be the backup catcher for the Yankees 
in spring training in 2014.[17] Cervelli won the job,[18] but suffered 
a hamstring injury on April 13, and was placed on the 60 day disabled list.[19] 
He returned to the Yankees on June 17.[20] On September 6, Cervelli suffered 
from cluster migraines.[21] Though they were determined to not be the result 
of his prior concussions, he missed time while he recuperated.[22] Cervelli 
finished the 2014 season with a .301 batting average in 49 games.[23] On 
November 12, 2014, the Yankees traded Cervelli to the Pirates in exchange 
for pitcher Justin Wilson.[23][24] Cervelli started 124 games for the Pirates 
in 2015, in which he batted .295[25] and was worth 3.8 Wins Above Replacement. 
Prior to the 2016 season, the Pirates signed Cervelli to a one-year contract 
worth $3.5 million.[26] During the 2016 season, the Pirates signed Cervelli 
to a three-year contract extension, worth $31 million.[27] Cervelli played 
for the Italy national baseball team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic.[28]
