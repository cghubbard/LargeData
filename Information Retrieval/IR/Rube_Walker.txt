Albert Bluford "Rube" Walker (May 16, 1926 â€“ December 12, 1992) was an 
American Major League Baseball catcher and longtime pitching coach. A native 
of Lenoir, North Carolina, Walker was signed by the Chicago Cubs as an 
amateur free agent in 1944. He made his Major League Baseball debut with 
the Cubs on April 20, 1948, and appeared in his final game on June 15, 
1958. As a Brookyn Dodger, he was behind the plate when Bobby Thomson hit 
the "Shot Heard 'Round the World" on October 3, 1951, substituting for 
Hall of Famer Roy Campanella, who was nursing an injury. After retiring 
as an active player in June 1958, Walker served out the season as a Los 
Angeles Dodgers coach. He then was a minor league manager in the Dodgers' 
and New York Yankees' farm systems from 1959 through 1964. After 1965 he 
was a pitching coach for the Washington Senators, New York Mets, and Atlanta 
Braves, working closely with managers Gil Hodges, Yogi Berra and Joe Torre, 
among others. Walker was the Mets pitching coach for 14 seasons from 1968 
through 1981 including the 1969 World Champion "Amazin'" Mets. As the Mets' 
pitching coach, he supervised Hall of Famers Tom Seaver and Nolan Ryan. 
Walker scouted for the Braves and St. Louis Cardinals after his coaching 
career ended. The book Carl Erskine's Tales from the Dodgers Dugout: Extra 
Innings (2004) includes short stories from former Dodger pitcher Carl Erskine. 
Walker is prominent in many of these stories. His younger brother, Verlon 
"Rube" Walker, was nicknamed after him; Verlon was a longtime minor league 
catcher and manager, and served for 10 years (from 1961 until his death 
in March 1971) as a coach for the Cubs. Rube Walker died from lung cancer 
on December 12, 1992, in Morganton, North Carolina at age 66. He is interred 
at Blue Ridge Memorial Park in Lenoir, North Carolina. In the 1985 film 
Mask, Rocky Dennis states he is in need of Rube "Ruby" Walker baseball
