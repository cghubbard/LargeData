As player As manager Atanasio "Tony" Pérez Rigal (born May 14, 1942), is 
a Cuban former professional baseball player, manager and a member of the 
Baseball Hall of Fame. He played as a first baseman and third baseman in 
Major League Baseball, most notably for the Cincinnati Reds. Variously 
nicknamed "Big Dog", "Big Doggie", "Doggie", and "The Mayor of Riverfront",[1][2] 
the slugging seven-time All-Star earned two World Series rings during a 
twenty-three year playing career, and one World Series ring as a coach. 
Along with fellow stars Pete Rose and Johnny Bench, Pérez was a key member 
of Cincinnati's celebrated "Big Red Machine". Following a thirteen-year 
initial stint with the Reds (1964–76), he played for the Montreal Expos 
(1977–79), Boston Red Sox (1980–82) and Philadelphia Phillies (1983) before 
returning to Cincinnati for his final three seasons (1984–86). He finished 
his career with a .279 batting average, 379 home runs, 1,652 runs batted 
in and 1,272 runs scored. After retiring, Pérez went on to coach and later 
manage the Reds and manage the Florida Marlins. He currently holds the 
title of Special Assistant to the General Manager with the Marlins. He 
has been with the Marlins organization since they were created in 1993, 
as the Florida Marlins. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 
2000. Pérez was born in Ciego de Ávila, Cuba in 1942, the son of José Manuel 
and Teodora (Rígal) Pérez. Tony and his parents and siblings all lived 
in a two-bedroom row house owned by the sugar mill where Tony's father, 
and eventually Tony, worked. Tony later played shortstop for the mill's 
baseball team, Central Violeta.[3] He was signed to a pro contract in 1960 
at age 17 by Cincinnati Reds scout Tony Pacheco while playing on the Camagüey 
sugar factory team. He was assigned to the instructional team of the Reds' 
AAA affiliate Havana Sugar Kings. His "bonus" for signing with the Reds 
was the $2.50 cost of a visa and a plane ticket to Miami, Florida.[4] Pérez 
arrived in Florida in the spring of 1960 and participated in the Reds' 
spring training in Tampa. He played his first minor league game for the 
Reds' Class D affiliate in Geneva, New York at age 17 on May 1, 1960 in 
the season-opener for the New York–Pennsylvania League team. Starting at 
second base, his first professional hit was a triple as he went 1-5 in 
a 6-5, 13-inning loss to the Auburn Yankees. He went hitless in the next 
game (the Redlegs' home opener) in a 17–16 Redlegs win, and in the next 
game he got the team's only hit (a single) in a 5–0 loss. On June 25 he 
was placed on the disabled list. That same day, he was replaced on the 
active roster by just-signed 19-year-old Pete Rose, who was inserted into 
the starting lineup at second base. Upon Pérez's return, Rose remained 
at second base and Pérez played third base. Another of his teammates was 
Martín Dihigo Jr., son of Baseball Hall of Fame member and Negro leagues 
great and Cuban native Martín Dihigo.[5] Pérez hit .279 with 6 home runs 
in 104 games.[6] In 1961 he again played for Geneva and set several team 
batting records, batting .348 with 27 home runs in 121 games. In 1962 he 
was promoted to the Class B Rocky Mount Leafs in the Carolina League. He 
reported two weeks late, as he had trouble getting out of his homeland 
of Cuba. In 100 games, he hit .292 with 18 home runs and 74 RBI, making 
the all-star team as a third baseman, but his season was cut short after 
those 100 games due to a broken ankle.[7] In 1963 he was promoted to the 
Macon Peaches of the Class AA South Atlantic League, where in 69 games 
as a third baseman he hit .309 with 11 home runs and 48 RBIs before being 
promoted that same year to the Class AAA San Diego Padres of the Pacific 
Coast League. For San Diego that year, in 8 games he hit .379 with 1 home 
run and 5 RBI.[6] Playing for the Padres in 1964, Pérez, now playing first 
base, was named Most Valuable Player in the Pacific Coast League. Pérez 
hit .309 with 34 home runs and 107 RBI.[8] He was called up to the Reds 
and played his first two games in a doubleheader on July 26, 1964 at Cincinnati's 
Crosley Field. In his debut he started at first base, and in his first 
at-bat he drew a walk against left-handed pitcher Joe Gibbon. He went 0–2 
against Gibbon and Don Schwall in a 7–2 Reds win,[9] then went 0–4 against 
pitcher Bob Veale in a 5–1 Pirates win.[10] The following day he started 
at first base and batted fifth against the Braves at Milwaukee County Stadium. 
In an 11–2 Reds win, he got his first hit, a second-inning double off Denny 
Lemaster, and then scored his first run on a Johnny Edwards double. In 
the seventh inning he got his first RBI, a single off Lemaster to score 
Frank Robinson.[11] From 1964 through 1966, he platooned at first base, 
primarily with Deron Johnson and Gordy Coleman. His first career home run, 
a grand slam, came in the Reds' second game of 1965, at home in Crosley 
Field against Milwaukee — and again against Denny Lemaster. The grand slam 
came with 2 outs and scored Vada Pinson, Frank Robinson, and Deron Johnson.[12] 
Pérez became the Reds' starter at third base in 1967 and was selected to 
his first All-Star team in 1967. The game, played on July 11, 1967, at 
Anaheim Stadium, went into 15 innings, the longest All-Star Game in history 
(since equaled by the 2008 game).[13] Pérez's home run off future fellow 
Hall of Famer Catfish Hunter propelled the National League to a 2-1 victory. 
He was subsequently voted the Most Valuable Player of the 1967 All-Star 
Game.[14] In 1970, Pérez hit the first home run in Pittsburgh's Three Rivers 
Stadium.[15] The 1970 campaign was his finest year, statistically: in addition 
to his 129 RBIs, Pérez hit .317, slugged 40 home runs and scored 107 runs. 
He came in third in the Most Valuable Player voting behind Billy Williams 
and Reds' teammate and winner Johnny Bench.[16] Pérez also played winter 
ball for 10 seasons between 1964–65 and 1982-83 in the Puerto Rico Baseball 
League for the Santurce Crabbers (Cangrejeros de Santurce). He won the 
batting title and was named league MVP in 1966-67.[17][18] After platooning 
and playing first base in the early part of his career (1964–66) with the 
Cincinnati Reds, he became a perennial all-star starting at third base 
from 1967 to 1971. From 1972 onward he starred at first base. Pérez was 
one of the premier RBI men of his generation, driving in 100 or more runs 
seven times in his 23-year-long career. In an eleven-year stretch from 
1967 to 1977, Pérez drove in 90 or more runs each year, with a high of 
129 RBIs in 1970. During the decade of the 1970s, Pérez was second among 
all major-leaguers in RBI, with 954, behind only his teammate Johnny Bench. 
Beginning in 1970, the Reds went to the World Series four times in seven 
years, winning back-to-back world championships in 1975 and 1976, with 
Pérez starting at first base. Following the Reds sweep of the Phillies 
in the 1976 League Championship Series and New York Yankees in the 1976 
World Series (the only time a team has ever swept the postseason since 
the League Championship Series was introduced in 1969), Pérez was traded 
to the Montreal Expos with Will McEnaney for Woodie Fryman and Dale Murray.[19] 
After his trade, the "Big Red Machine"—considered one of baseball's all-time 
greatest teams—sputtered and never again got into the Series, reaching 
the playoffs but one more time in 1979. Sparky Anderson, the Reds manager 
during the championships of the 1970s, has stated in many interviews since 
that Pérez was the leader, and heart and soul of those teams. After three 
seasons in Montreal (in which he hit 46 home runs with 242 RBIs and a .281 
batting average), for the 1980 season, Pérez signed as a free agent with 
the Boston Red Sox. In his first season with the Red Sox, he finished in 
the top 10 in the American League in home runs (25), RBIs (105) and intentional 
walks (11), and won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award.[19] For the 1983 season, 
Pérez reunited with "Big Red Machine" teammates Pete Rose and Joe Morgan 
on the Philadelphia Phillies. Still a feared hitter based on his reputation, 
Pérez was a reserve player on the 1983 National League Champion Phillies, 
and batted .242 in his five World Series appearances. Following the season, 
he returned to the Cincinnati Reds as a free agent, where he remained until 
his retirement following the 1986 season.[19] In 1984, at age 42, he became 
the oldest player to hit a walk-off pinch-hit home run (off the Pirates' 
Don Robinson). On May 13, 1985, batting against Philadelphia Phillies' 
reliever Dave Rucker, he became the oldest player (44) to hit a grand slam, 
breaking a 70-year-old record held by Honus Wagner.[20][21] The new record 
stood until Julio Franco broke it at age 46 in 2004. Pérez was named National 
League Player of the Week during the final week of his career at age 44, 
when he went 8-for-19 with a home run, three doubles, and 6 runs batted 
in.[19] His final career hit and RBI came on October 4, 1986 at Riverfront 
Stadium when he hit a solo home run off San Diego Padres pitcher Ed Whitson 
in a 10–7 Reds win.[22] The following day was the Reds' last game of the 
year and the final game of his career. In his final at-bat, he flied out 
against Andy Hawkins in a 2–1 Padres' win.[23] Pérez was a seven-time All-Star 
who was voted the Most Valuable Player of the 1967 All-Star Game. He was 
inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1998. On May 27, 2000, 
in an on-field pre-game ceremony at Cinergy Field (formerly Riverfront 
Stadium) with family and former teammates and managers, the Reds retired 
his number, 24.[1] In 2000, Pérez was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame 
in Cooperstown, New York, garnering 385 votes on 499 ballots for a total 
of 77.15%, just over the three-quarters minimum required for induction. 
He was inducted in July 2000 along with Sparky Anderson, Carlton Fisk, 
Bid McPhee and Turkey Stearnes. In his induction speech, he said, "I doubt 
that a king at his coronation feels better than me today."[24] Each year 
since his induction, he has attended the weekend ceremonies, including 
riding in the annual parade and playing in the annual golf outing and old-timers' 
baseball game.[25] Pérez was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball 
Museum Hall of Fame in 2001 at a pre-game ceremony held at the San Francisco 
Giants' Pacific Bell Park.[26] That same year he threw out the ceremonial 
first pitch at the 2001 All-Star Game at the Seattle Mariners' Safeco Field; 
he had played at the Mariners' previous home, the Kingdome, during the 
1979 All-Star Game. Pérez in 1998 was inducted into the Caribbean Baseball 
Hall of Fame, which honors those that have made significant achievements 
in the Caribbean Series. He was one of 24 inaugural inductees into the 
Latino Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010.[27] He was inducted in 2010 to the 
Cuban Sports Hall of Fame.[28] In 2011, with Pérez and his sons in attendance 
at opening ceremonies of the Museo del Deporte de Puerto Rico in Guaynabo, 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, his adopted homeland, presented him with 
a surprise honor. He was proclaimed an official "native son" of Puerto 
Rico "for his dedication to the commonwealth as a family and community 
member, and for his impressive baseball accolades while representing the 
island." Also present were fellow Hall-of-Famers Orlando Cepeda and Roberto 
Alomar plus Vera Clemente, widow of Roberto Clemente.[29] Pérez was never 
on the disabled list during his 23-year Major League career. The longest 
stretch of games that he missed due to injury was 10, after he was struck 
on the right thumb by a pitch from the Philadelphia Phillies' Jim Lonborg 
in 1975.[30] On August 10, 2014 at the annual Reds Hall of Fame Induction 
Gala, former Reds teammates Johnny Bench and Joe Morgan along with Pérez 
himself announced that the Reds would erect a statue of Pérez outside Great 
American Ball Park.[31] On the weekend of August 21–22, 2015, the Cincinnati 
Reds held Tony Pérez Weekend during a series with the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
At least a dozen players of the Big Red Machine will be part of a post-game 
ceremony Friday night. On Saturday, a bronze statue of Pérez will be unveiled 
near the entrance to Great American Ball Park. Fans attending the game 
will receive replica statues, and there will be a pre-game ceremony honoring 
Pérez, followed by him throwing the ceremonial first pitch.[32] While playing 
winter ball in Puerto Rico in 1964, Pérez met Juana ("Pituka") de la Cantera, 
daughter of Pablo de la Cantera and Edilia Cortina.[34] Also of Cuban descent, 
she grew up in Puerto Rico. Four months after meeting the couple was married 
in early 1965.[35] They both became American citizens on October 18, 1971, 
in Cincinnati,[36] and have two sons, both born there — Victor Pérez (May 
11, 1966) and Eduardo Pérez (September 11, 1969). Victor played one year 
(1990) in the Reds' minor league system.[37] He attended and graduated 
from Xavier University in Cincinnati with a Bachelor of Applied Science 
degree in Finance and Computer Science. He later moved to New York City, 
where he worked in real estate and in telecommunications. He also attended 
acting school there and became a professional actor, first in New York 
City, and then for several years in London.[35][38] Eduardo was an All-American 
third baseman at Florida State University and played in the College World 
Series. He was drafted in the first round (17th overall pick) by the California 
Angels. He played Major League Baseball for 13 seasons. After retiring 
as a player, he served as an ESPN commentator for five years. In 2009 he 
managed Leones de Ponce to the Puerto Rican League championship, and in 
2011 and 2012 he was hitting coach for the Miami Marlins. He was bench 
coach of the Houston Astros for the 2013 season, and will be an Astros' 
base coach in 2014. He is married to Mirba (Rivera) and they have two daughters, 
Andreanna and Juliana.[39] In November, 1972, Tony Pérez was granted a 
20-day visa to return to Cuba for the first time since a 1963 trip; however, 
the visa did not permit his wife and children to go, according to "Latino 
Baseball Legends: An Encyclopedia" by Lew Freedman. He took 17 suitcases 
of gifts, clothes, and medical supplies and reunited with his family in 
Central Violeta, Cuba—a 400-mile train ride from Havana.[4] Tony's father, 
Jose Manuel — with whom Tony worked alongside as a teenager at the Camagüey 
sugar factory, hauling and stamping the company's name on the bags — died 
in 1979 at age 84 (some sources list his year of death as 1977). Tony has 
stated that, during his playing career, his family in Cuba would listen 
to the Voice of America, which would give daily updates on Cuban players 
playing in the majors.[4][35][40] Tony's mother, Teodora ("Tita"), was 
88 when Tony called her with the news in 2000 that he had been elected 
to the Hall of Fame.[24] Tony was able to make a return visit to Cuba in 
2002, only this time with his sons. Teodora died in 2008. Tony's oldest 
sister died in 1997. In 2000, for a luncheon honoring Tony, the Marlins 
arranged to surprise him by helping his two living sisters, Argelia and 
Gloria, secure visas and come to Miami from their homes in Central Violeta, 
Camagüey, Cuba.[41][42][43][44] Tony Pérez has cited Cuban-born Minnie 
Miñoso as his boyhood idol.[45] Pérez has been an advocate for many years 
in articles, speeches, and discussions to get Minoso elected to the Baseball
