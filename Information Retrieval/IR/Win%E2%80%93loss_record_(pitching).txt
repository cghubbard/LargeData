In baseball and softball, a pitcher's win–loss record (also referred to 
simply as their record) indicates the number of wins (denoted "W") and 
losses (denoted "L") they have been credited with. For example, a 20–10 
win–loss record would represent 20 wins and 10 losses. In each game, one 
pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win (the "winning pitcher") and 
one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss (the "losing pitcher") in 
their respective statistics. These pitchers are collectively known as the 
pitchers of record. The designation of win or loss for a pitcher is known 
as a decision, and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision. 
A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said 
to have no decision. In certain situations, another pitcher on the winning 
team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with 
a save, and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides, but 
these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win. The 
decisions are awarded by the official scorer of the game in accordance 
with the league's rules. The official scorer does not assign a winning 
or losing pitcher in some games which are forfeited, such as those that 
are tied at the time of forfeiture. If the game is tied (a rare event), 
no pitcher is awarded any decision. A pitcher's winning percentage is calculated 
by dividing the number of wins by the number of decisions (wins plus losses), 
and it is commonly expressed with three decimal places. In Major League 
Baseball, the winning pitcher is defined as the pitcher who last pitched 
prior to the half-inning when the winning team took the lead for the last 
time. There are two exceptions to this rule. The first is that a starting 
pitcher must complete five innings to earn a win (four innings for a game 
that lasts five innings on defense). If he fails to do so, he is ineligible 
to be the winning pitcher even if he last pitched prior to the half-inning 
when his team took the lead for the last time, and the official scorer 
awards the win to the relief pitcher who, in the official scorer's judgment, 
was the most effective. The second exception applies if the relief pitcher 
who last pitched prior to the half-inning when the winning team took the 
lead for the last time was "ineffective in a brief appearance" in the official 
scorer's judgment, in which case the win is awarded to the succeeding relief 
pitcher who, in the official scorer's judgment, was the most effective.[1] 
In the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, every pitcher is considered 
as a relief pitcher for the purpose of this rule. For example, a starting 
pitcher Matt Cain was awarded the win in the 2012 All-Star Game despite 
throwing only two innings.[2] The losing pitcher is the pitcher who allows 
the go-ahead run to reach base for a lead that the winning team never relinquishes. 
If a pitcher allows a run which gives the opposing team the lead, his team 
comes back to lead or tie the game, and then the opposing team regains 
the lead against a subsequent pitcher, the earlier pitcher does not get 
the loss. If a pitcher leaves the game with his team in the lead or with 
the score tied, but with the go-ahead run on base, and this runner subsequently 
scores the go-ahead run, the pitcher who allowed this runner to reach base 
is responsible for the loss. This is true regardless of the manner in which 
this batter originally reached base, and how he subsequently scored. If 
the relief pitching successfully completes the half-inning without surrendering 
the go-ahead run, the departed pitcher cannot receive a loss. For example, 
on April 13, 2007, Carlos Zambrano of the Chicago Cubs was facing the Cincinnati 
Reds in the top of the 5th inning. He was taken out of the game with the 
Cubs leading 5–4 and the bases loaded. The pitcher who replaced him, Will 
Ohman, proceeded to allow two of the runners on base to score, giving the 
Reds a 6–5 lead. Although Zambrano was not pitching at the time the runs 
were scored, he was charged with the loss, as the base runners who scored 
were his responsibility.[3] The pitchers who receive the win and the loss 
are known, collectively, as the pitchers of record. A pitcher who starts 
a game but leaves without earning either a win or a loss (that is, before 
either team gains or surrenders the ultimate lead) is said to have received 
a no decision, regardless of his individual performance. A pitcher's total 
wins and losses are commonly noted together; for instance, a pitching record 
of 12–10 indicates 12 wins and 10 losses. In the early years of Major League 
Baseball before 1900 it was common for an exceptional pitcher to win 30 
or more games in one season with Old Hoss Radbourn of the defunct Providence 
Grays holding the record with 59 wins in 1884. Since 1900, however, pitchers 
have made fewer and fewer starts and the standard has changed. Gradually, 
as hitting improved, better pitching was needed. This meant, among other 
things, throwing the ball much harder, and it became unrealistic to ask 
a pitcher to throw nearly as hard as he could for over 100 pitches a game 
without giving him several days to recover. In the first third of the 20th 
century (especially after the live-ball era), winning 30 games became the 
rare mark of excellent achievement; this standard diminished to 25 games 
during the 1940s through 1980s (the only pitcher to win 30 or more games 
during that time was Denny McLain in 1968, in what was an anomalous pitching-dominated 
season). Since 1990, this has changed even further, as winning 20 or more 
games in a single season is now achieved by only a handful of pitchers 
each season. For example, in 2004 only three of the more than five hundred 
major league pitchers did so. In 2006 and again in 2009, no pitcher in 
either league won 20 games.[4] The last pitcher to win 25 games was Bob 
Welch in 1990. The New York Times wrote in 2011 that as advanced statistics 
have expanded, a pitcher's win-loss record has decreased in importance. 
For example, Félix Hernández won the Cy Young Award in 2010 in spite of 
a 13–12 record.[5] Many times a win is substantially out of the pitcher's 
control; even a dominant pitcher cannot record a win if his team does not 
score any runs for him. For instance, in 2004, Milwaukee Brewers starting 
pitcher Ben Sheets had a losing record of 12–14, despite displaying a league-best 
8:1 strikeout-to-walk ratio and was among the top 5 pitchers in ERA (2.70) 
and WHIP (0.98).[6] In addition to their dependence on run support, wins 
for a starting pitcher are also dependent on bullpen support. A starting 
pitcher can pitch brilliantly, leaving the game with the lead, and then 
watch helplessly from the dugout as the bullpen blows the save and gives 
up the lead. That would entitle the starting pitcher to a no-decision instead 
of a win despite the strong performance, regardless of whether or not the 
team ends up winning. Starting pitchers on teams with a weak bullpen tend 
to have fewer wins because of this. Likewise, a pitcher can give a poor 
performance and give up many runs and leave the game earlier than desired, 
but still win because his team scored even more runs. Some prefer the quality 
start statistic as an indication of how many times a starting pitcher gave
