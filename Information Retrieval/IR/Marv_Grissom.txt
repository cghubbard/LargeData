Marvin Edward Grissom (March 31, 1918 – September 18, 2005) was an American 
professional baseball pitcher and pitching coach. During his active career 
he appeared in 356 games in Major League Baseball for the New York and 
San Francisco Giants (1946 and 1953–58), Detroit Tigers (1949), Chicago 
White Sox (1952), Boston Red Sox (1953) and St. Louis Cardinals (1959).[1] 
Born in Los Molinos, California, he threw and batted right-handed, stood 
6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) tall and weighed 190 pounds (86 kg).[2] His elder 
brother, Lee, was a left-handed pitcher for four MLB teams between 1934 
and 1941.[3] Grissom's pro career began in 1941 in the Giants' organization, 
but he missed four seasons (1942–45) serving in the United States Navy 
during World War II.[4] When he resumed his career in 1946, he was called 
up from Triple-A in September; he made three starts in four games, dropped 
each of his two decisions, then spent all of 1947–48 back in the minor 
leagues. The Tigers selected him in the 1948 Rule 5 draft, and he spent 
all of 1949 on the Detroit roster, working in 27 games (all but two as 
a relief pitcher), and posting a poor 2–4 record and 6.41 earned run average. 
Two more years at Triple-A followed; during the second, 1951, Grissom won 
20 games for the Seattle Rainiers. Then, during the 1951–52 offseason, 
he was acquired by the White Sox. In 1952, at age 34, Grissom finally established 
himself as a Major League pitcher, going 12–10 (3.74) in 28 games (24 as 
a starter) and 166 innings pitched, with seven complete games and one shutout. 
The following February, he was one of three ChiSox hurlers swapped to the 
pitching-poor Red Sox for veteran shortstop Vern Stephens. But after a 
promising start to his 1953 campaign, Grissom's Red Sox career unraveled 
when he allowed 12 hits and 12 earned runs in only 2⅓ innings over two 
outings against the Cleveland Indians at Fenway Park on June 24–25. His 
ERA ballooned from 3.05 to 4.78, and after only one more appearance, Grissom 
was placed on waivers. He was claimed by the Giants on July 1. He got into 
21 games for them, with seven starts and three complete games. He also 
began to pitch out of the bullpen for manager Leo Durocher, although he 
recorded no saves that year. But in 1954, Grissom found his niche as one 
of Durocher's ace relief pitchers — Hall of Famer Hoyt Wilhelm was the 
other — as he helped the Giants win the National League pennant. He led 
the club in saves (17, third in the league) and won ten other games, nine 
in relief. Grissom was named to the National League All-Star team and finished 
24th in voting for NL MVP Award.[5] In 122⅓ innings pitched, he had 64 
strikeouts and a 2.35 earned run average.[1] Then, in the 1954 World Series 
against the Indians, Grissom was the winning pitcher in Game 1, the contest 
marked by Willie Mays' classic, over-the-shoulder catch of Vic Wertz' long 
drive to center field. Grissom came into the game in the eighth inning, 
immediately after Mays' catch, in relief of Don Liddle and with game tied, 
2–2. He proceeded to pitch 2 2⁄3 innings of one-hit ball, and held Cleveland 
off the scoreboard until pinch hitter Dusty Rhodes won the game with a 
three-run, walk-off home run in the tenth inning.[6] It was Grissom's only 
appearance in the Series, as the Giants swept Cleveland in four straight 
games.[7] Grissom also shone as a relief pitcher for the next four seasons, 
leading the Giants in saves three more times (1955; 1957–58). He was a 
member of the last Giants' team to represent New York City, and the first 
one based in San Francisco. Traded to the Cardinals in October 1958, he 
was able to appear in only three games for the 1959 Redbirds before a back 
injury forced his retirement as an active player. In ten MLB seasons, Grissom 
had a 47–45 record, 356 games (52 started), 12 complete games, 3 shutouts, 
58 saves, 810 innings pitched, 343 walks, 459 strikeouts and a 3.41 ERA.[1] 
After his playing career, Grissom had a 15-year-long tenure as a pitching 
coach for four MLB teams: the Los Angeles/California Angels (during three 
separate terms: 1961–66; 1969; 1977–78), White Sox (1967–68), Minnesota 
Twins (1970–71) and Chicago Cubs (1975–76).[8] He died in Red Bluff, California,
