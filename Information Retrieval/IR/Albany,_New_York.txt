Albany (i/ˈɔːlbəniː/ AWL-bə-nee) is the capital of the U.S. state of New 
York and the seat of Albany County. Roughly 150 miles (240 km) north of 
New York City, Albany developed on the west bank of the Hudson River, about 
10 miles (16 km) south of its confluence with the Mohawk River. The population 
of the City of Albany was 97,856 according to the 2010 census. Albany constitutes 
the economic and cultural core of the Capital District of New York State, 
which comprises the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY Metropolitan Statistical 
Area, including the nearby cities and suburbs of Troy, Schenectady, and 
Saratoga Springs. With a Census-estimated population of 1,170,483 in 2013,[3] 
the Capital District is the third-most populous metropolitan region in 
the state and 38th in the United States.[4][5] Fortune 500 companies that 
have offices in Albany include American Express, J.P. Morgan and Chase,[6] 
Merrill Lynch,[7][8] General Electric, Verizon, Goldman Sachs,[9] International 
Paper,[10] Key Bank, .[11] In the 21st century, the Capital District has 
emerged as a major anchor of Tech Valley, the moniker describing the technologically-focused 
region of eastern New York State. This was the first European settlement 
in the state, settled by Dutch colonists who built Fort Nassau for fur 
trading in 1614 and Fort Orange in 1624. They formed successful relations 
with both the Mahican and the Mohawk peoples, two major Native American 
nations in the region. The fur trade attracted settlers who founded a village 
called Beverwijck near Fort Orange. In 1664 the English took over the Dutch 
settlements, renaming the city as Albany, in honor of the then Duke of 
Albany, the future James II of England and James VII of Scotland. The city 
was officially chartered in 1686 under English rule. It became the capital 
of New York State in 1797, following the United States gaining independence 
in the American Revolutionary War. Albany is one of the oldest surviving 
settlements of the original British thirteen colonies, and the longest 
continuously chartered city in the United States. Its charter is possibly 
the longest-running instrument of municipal government in the Western Hemisphere.[12] 
During the late 18th century and throughout most of the 19th, Albany was 
a center of trade and transportation. It is located on the north end of 
the navigable Hudson River, was the original eastern terminus of the Erie 
Canal connecting to the Great Lakes, and was home to some of the earliest 
railroad systems in the world. Albany's main exports at the time were beer, 
lumber, published works, and ironworks. Beginning in 1810, Albany was one 
of the ten most populous cities in the United States, a distinction that 
it held until the 1860 census. Albany is one of the first cities in the 
world to have installed public water mains, sewer lines, natural gas lines 
and electricity, infrastructure and utilities that attracted and supported 
substantial new industry to the city and surrounding area during the 19th 
century.[13] In the 20th century, the city opened one of the first commercial 
airports in the world, the precursor of today's Albany International Airport. 
During the 1920s a powerful political machine controlled by the Democratic 
Party arose in the state capital, connected to politics in New York City 
as well. It marshalled the power of immigrants and their descendants in 
both cities. The city's skyline changed in the 1940s and 1950s with the 
construction of office towers around the Empire State Plaza and at the 
uptown campus of SUNY Albany,[b] mainly under the direction of Governor 
Nelson Rockefeller. While Albany experienced a decline in its population 
due to urban sprawl and suburbanization, many of its historic neighborhoods 
were saved from destruction through the policies of Mayor Erastus Corning 
2nd, the longest-serving mayor of any city in the United States. In the 
early 21st century, Albany has experienced growth in the high-technology 
industry, with great strides in the nanotechnology sector.[14][15] Albany 
has been a center of higher education for over a century, with much of 
the remainder of its economy dependent on state government and health care 
services. The city has rebounded from the urban decline of the 1970s and 
1980s, with noticeable development taking place in the city's downtown 
and midtown neighborhoods. Albany is known for its rich history, commerce, 
culture, architecture, and institutions of higher education. Albany won 
the All-America City Award in both 1991 and 2009.[16] Albany is one of 
the oldest surviving European settlements from the original thirteen colonies[17] 
and the longest continuously chartered city in the United States.[c] The 
Hudson River area was originally inhabited by Algonquian-speaking Mohican 
(Mahican), who called it Pempotowwuthut-Muhhcanneuw, meaning "the fireplace 
of the Mohican nation."[20] Based to the west along the Mohawk River, the 
Iroquoian-speaking Mohawk referred to it as Sche-negh-ta-da, or "through 
the pine woods," referring to the path they took there.[21][d] The Mohawk 
were one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, or Haudenosaunee, 
and became strong trading partners with the Dutch and English. It is likely 
that the Albany area was visited by European fur traders, perhaps as early 
as 1540, but the extent and duration of those visits has not been determined.[23] 
Permanent European claims began when Englishman Henry Hudson, exploring 
for the Dutch East India Company on the Half Moon (Dutch: Halve Maen), 
reached the area in 1609, claiming it for the United Netherlands.[24] In 
1614, Hendrick Christiaensen built Fort Nassau, a fur-trading post and 
the first documented European structure in present-day Albany. Commencement 
of the fur trade provoked hostility from the French colony in Canada and 
among the natives, all of whom vied to control the trade. In 1618, a flood 
ruined the fort on Castle Island, but it was rebuilt in 1624 as Fort Orange.[25] 
Both forts were named in honor of the Dutch royal House of Orange-Nassau.[26] 
Fort Orange and the surrounding area were incorporated as the village of 
Beverwijck (English: Beaver District) in 1652.[27][28] In these early decades 
of trade, the Dutch, Mohican and Mohawk developed relations that reflected 
differences among their three cultures.[29] When New Netherland was captured 
by the English in 1664, they changed the name Beverwijck to Albany, in 
honor of the Duke of Albany (later James II of England and James VII of 
Scotland).[30][e] Duke of Albany was a Scottish title given since 1398, 
generally to a younger son of the King of Scots.[31] The name is ultimately 
derived from Alba, the Gaelic name for Scotland.[32] The Dutch briefly 
regained Albany in August 1673 and renamed the city Willemstadt; the English 
took permanent possession with the Treaty of Westminster (1674).[33] On 
November 1, 1683, the Province of New York was split into counties, with 
Albany County being the largest. At that time the county included all of 
present New York State north of Dutchess and Ulster Counties in addition 
to present-day Bennington County, Vermont, theoretically stretching west 
to the Pacific Ocean;[34][35] the city of Albany became the county seat.[36] 
Albany was formally chartered as a municipality by provincial Governor 
Thomas Dongan on July 22, 1686. The Dongan Charter was virtually identical 
in content to the charter awarded to the city of New York three months 
earlier.[37] Dongan created Albany as a strip of land 1 mile (1.6 km) wide 
and 16 miles (26 km) long.[38] Over the years Albany would lose much of 
the land to the west and annex land to the north and south. At this point, 
Albany had a population of about 500 people.[39] In 1754, representatives 
of seven British North American colonies met in the Stadt Huys, Albany's 
city hall, for the Albany Congress; Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania presented 
the Albany Plan of Union there, which was the first formal proposal to 
unite the colonies.[40] Although it was never adopted by Parliament, it 
was an important precursor to the United States Constitution.[41][f] The 
same year, the French and Indian War, the fourth in a series of wars dating 
back to 1689, began; it ended in 1763 with French defeat, resolving a situation 
that had been a constant threat to Albany and held back its growth.[42] 
In 1775, with the colonies in the midst of the Revolutionary War, the Stadt 
Huys became home to the Albany Committee of Correspondence (the political 
arm of the local revolutionary movement), which took over operation of 
Albany's government and eventually expanded its power to control all of 
Albany County. Tories and prisoners of war were often jailed in the Stadt 
Huys alongside common criminals.[43] In 1776, Albany native Philip Livingston 
signed the Declaration of Independence at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.[44] 
During and after the Revolutionary War, Albany County saw a great increase 
in real estate transactions. After Horatio Gates' win over John Burgoyne 
at Saratoga in 1777, the upper Hudson Valley was generally at peace as 
the war raged on elsewhere. Prosperity was soon seen all over Upstate New 
York. Migrants from Vermont and Connecticut began flowing in, noting the 
advantages of living on the Hudson and trading at Albany, while being only 
a few days' sail from New York City.[45] Albany reported a population of 
3,498 in the first national census in 1790, an increase of almost 700% 
since its chartering.[39] In 1797, the state capital of New York was moved 
permanently to Albany. From statehood to this date, the Legislature had 
frequently moved the state capital between Albany, Kingston, Hurley, Poughkeepsie, 
and the city of New York.[46] Albany is the tenth-oldest state capital 
in the United States, but only the second-oldest state capital that is 
a city, after Santa Fe, New Mexico.[47] Albany has been a center of transportation 
for much of its history. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Albany 
saw development of the turnpike and by 1815, Albany was the turnpike center 
of the state. Simeon De Witt developed a grid block system in 1794, and 
renamed streets for birds and mammals that had previously honored British 
royalty.[g] This grid was intersected by the major arterials coming out 
of Albany, which cut through the city at unexpected angles.[50][51] The 
construction of the turnpike across the state, in conjunction with canal 
and railroad systems, made Albany the hub of transportation for pioneers 
going to Buffalo and the Michigan Territory in the early- and mid-19th 
century.[50][52] In 1807, Robert Fulton initiated a steamboat line from 
New York to Albany, the first successful enterprise of its kind.[53] By 
1810, with 10,763 people, Albany was the 10th-largest urban place in the 
nation.[54] The town and village were known as "the Colonie"[h] to the 
north of Albany was annexed in 1815.[55] In 1825 the Erie Canal was completed, 
forming a continuous water route from the Great Lakes to New York City. 
Unlike the current Barge Canal, which ends at nearby Waterford, the original 
Erie Canal ended at Albany; Lock 1 was located north of Colonie Street.[57] 
The Canal emptied into a 32-acre (13 ha) man-made lagoon called the Albany 
Basin, which was Albany's main port from 1825 until the Port of Albany-Rensselaer 
opened in 1932.[58][59] In 1829, while working as a professor at the Albany 
Academy, Joseph Henry, widely regarded as "the foremost American scientist 
of the 19th century",[60] built the first electric motor. Three years later, 
he discovered electromagnetic self-induction (the SI unit for which is 
now the henry). He went on to be the first Secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution.[61] In the 1830 and 1840 censuses, Albany was ranked as the 
9th-largest urban place in the nation,[62][63] then back to 10th in 1850.[64] 
This was the last time the city was one of the top ten largest urban places 
in the nation.[65] Albany also has significant history with rail transport,[66] 
as the location of two major regional railroad headquarters. The Delaware 
and Hudson Railway was headquartered in Albany at what is now the SUNY 
System Administration Building.[67] In 1853, Erastus Corning, a noted industrialist 
and Albany's mayor from 1834 to 1837, consolidated ten railroads stretching 
from Albany to Buffalo into the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR), headquartered 
in Albany until Cornelius Vanderbilt moved it to New York City in 1867.[68][69] 
One of the ten companies that formed the NYCRR was the Mohawk and Hudson 
Railroad, which was the first railroad in the state and the first successful 
steam railroad running regularly scheduled service in the country.[70][71] 
While the key to Albany's economic prosperity in the 19th century was transportation, 
industry and business also played a role. Largely thanks to the city's 
Dutch and German roots, beer was one of its biggest commodities. Beverwyck 
Brewery, originally known as Quinn and Nolan (Nolan being mayor of Albany 
1878–1883),[73] was the last remaining brewer from that time when it closed 
in 1972. The city's location at the east end of the Erie Canal gave it 
unparalleled access to both raw products and a captive customer base in 
the west.[74] Albany was known for its publishing houses, and to some extent, 
still is. Albany was second only to Boston in the number of books produced 
for most of the 19th century.[75] Iron foundries in both the north and 
south ends of the city brought thousands of immigrants to the city. To 
this day, one can see many intricate wrought-iron details on older buildings. 
The iron industry waned by the 1890s due to increased costs associated 
with a newly unionized workforce and the opening of mines in the Mesabi 
Range in Minnesota.[76] Albany's other major exports during the 18th and 
19th centuries were furs, wheat, meat, and lumber;[77] by 1865, there were 
almost 4,000 saw mills in the Albany area[77] and the Albany Lumber District 
was the largest lumber market in the nation.[72] The city was also home 
to a number of banks. The Bank of Albany (1792–1861) was the second chartered 
bank in New York.[78] The city was the original home of the Albank (founded 
in 1820 as the Albany Savings Bank),[79] KeyBank (founded in 1825 as the 
Commercial Bank of Albany),[80] and Norstar Bank (founded as the State 
Bank of Albany in 1803).[81] American Express was originally founded in 
Albany in 1850 as an express mail business.[82] In 1871, the northwestern 
portion of Albany—west from Magazine Street—was annexed to the neighboring 
town of Guilderland[83] after the town of Watervliet refused annexation 
of said territory.[84][85] In return for this loss, portions of Bethlehem 
and Watervliet were added to Albany. Part of the land annexed to Guilderland 
was ceded back to Albany in 1910, setting up the current western border.[55] 
Albany opened one of the first commercial airports in the world, and the 
first municipal airport in the United States, in 1908. Originally located 
on a polo field on Loudon Road, it moved to Westerlo Island in 1909 and 
remained there until 1928. The Albany Municipal Airport—jointly owned by 
the city and county—was moved to its current location in Colonie in 1928. 
In 1960, the mayor sold the city's stake in the airport to the county, 
citing budget issues. It was known from then on as Albany County Airport 
until a massive upgrade and modernization project between 1996 and 1998, 
when it was rechristened Albany International Airport.[86] By 1916 Albany's 
northern and southern borders reached their modern courses;[55] Westerlo 
Island, to the south, became the second-to-last annexation, which occurred 
in 1926.[87] Erastus Corning 2nd, arguably Albany's most notable mayor 
(and great-grandson of the former mayor of the same name), was elected 
in 1941.[88] Although he was one of the longest-serving mayors of any city 
in United States history (1942 until his death in 1983), one historian 
describes Corning's tenure as "long on years, short on accomplishments."[89] 
Grondahl cited Corning's preference for maintaining the status quo as a 
factor that held back potential progress during his tenure.[90] While Corning 
brought stability to the office of mayor, it is said that even those who 
admire him greatly cannot come up with a sizable list of "major concrete 
Corning achievements."[91] Corning is given credit for saving—albeit somewhat 
unintentionally—much of Albany's historic architecture.[i] During the 1950s 
and 1960s, a time when federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful,[90] 
Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure. It lost more 
than 20 percent of its population during the Corning years, as people moved 
to newer housing in the suburbs, followed by most of the downtown businesses 
moving there as well.[92] While cities across the country grappled with 
similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from 
the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.[90] Governor 
Nelson Rockefeller (1959–1973) (R) tried to stimulate the city with grandiose, 
monumental architecture and large, government-sponsored building projects; 
he drove construction of the Empire State Plaza, SUNY Albany's uptown campus, 
and much of the W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus.[93] Albany 
County Republican Chairman Joseph C. Frangella once quipped, "Governor 
Rockefeller was the best mayor Albany ever had."[94] Corning, though opposed 
to the project, was responsible for negotiating the payment plan for the 
Empire State Plaza. Rockefeller did not want to be limited by the Legislature's 
power of the purse, so Corning devised a plan to have the county pay for 
the construction and have the state sign a lease-ownership agreement. The 
state paid off the bonds until 2004. It was Rockefeller's only viable option, 
and he agreed. Due to the clout Corning gained from the situation, he was 
able to get the State Museum, a convention center, and a restaurant, back 
in the plans—ideas which Rockefeller had originally vetoed. The county 
gained $35 million in fees and the city received $13 million for lost tax 
revenue. Having the state offices located in the city enabled it to keep 
good jobs.[95] Another major project of the 1960s and 1970s was Interstate 
787 and the South Mall Arterial.[j] Construction began in the early 1960s. 
One of the project's main results, since regretted, was separating the 
city from the Hudson River, its source of development. Corning has been 
described as shortsighted with respect to use of the waterfront, as he 
could have used his influence to change the location of I-787, which now 
cuts the city off from "its whole raison d'être".[96] Much of the original 
plan never came to fruition, however: Rockefeller had wanted the South 
Mall Arterial to pass through the Empire State Plaza. The project would 
have required an underground trumpet interchange below Washington Park, 
connecting to the (eventually cancelled) Mid-Crosstown Arterial.[97] To 
this day, evidence of the original plan is still visible.[k] In 1967 the 
hamlet of Karlsfeld was the last annexation by the city, taken from the 
Town of Bethlehem.[55] When Corning died in 1983, Thomas Whalen assumed 
the mayorship and was reelected twice. He encouraged redevelopment of historic 
structures and helped attract federal dollars earmarked for that purpose. 
What Corning had saved from destruction, Whalen refurbished for continued 
and new uses.[98] The Mayor's Office of Special Events was created in an 
effort to increase the number of festivals and artistic events in the city, 
including a year-long Dongan Charter tricentennial celebration in 1986.[99] 
Whalen is credited for an "unparalleled cycle of commercial investment 
and development" in Albany due to his "aggressive business development 
programs".[100] Prior to the recession of the 1990s, downtown Albany was 
home to four Fortune 500 companies.[101] After the death of Corning and 
the retirement of Congressman Sam Stratton, the political environment changes. 
Long-term office holders became rare in the 1980s. Local media began following 
the drama surrounding county politics (specifically that of the newly created 
county executive position); the loss of Corning (and eventually the machine) 
led to a lack of interest in city politics.[102] The election of Gerald 
Jennings was a surprise, and he served as Mayor from 1994 until his retirement 
at the end of 2013. His tenure essentially ended the political machine 
that had been in place since the 1920s.[103] During the 1990s, the State 
Legislature approved the $234 million "Albany Plan", "a building and renovation 
project [that] was the most ambitious building project to affect the area 
since the Rockefeller era." Under the Albany Plan, renovation and new building 
projects were initiated around the downtown area. Many state workers were 
relocated from the Harriman State Office Campus to downtown, helping its 
retail businesses and vitality.[104] During the first decade of the 21st 
century, progress was made on a long-discussed and controversial Albany 
Convention Center. As of August 2010, the Albany Convention Center Authority 
(authorized by the state legislature) had already purchased 75% of the 
land needed to build the downtown project.[105] Albany is located about 
150 miles (240 km) north of New York City on the Hudson River.[27] It has 
a total area of 21.8 square miles (56 km2), of which 21.4 square miles 
(55 km2) is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2) (1.8%) is water.[106] The 
city is bordered on the north by the town of Colonie (along with the village 
of Menands), on the west by the town of Guilderland, and on the south by 
the town of Bethlehem.[107] The Hudson River represents the city's eastern 
border. Patroon Creek, along the northern border, and the Normans Kill, 
along the southern border, are the two major streams in the city. The former 
Foxes Creek, Beaver Kill, and Rutten Kill still exist, but were diverted 
underground in the 19th century.[108][109][110] There are four lakes within 
city limits: Buckingham Lake; Rensselaer Lake at the mouth of the Patroon 
Creek; Tivoli Lake, which was formed as a reservoir and once connected 
to the Patroon Creek; and Washington Park Lake, which was formed by damming 
the Beaver Kill.[107][109] The highest natural point in Albany is a USGS 
benchmark near the Loudonville Reservoir off Birch Hill Road, at 378 feet 
(115 m) above sea level. The lowest point is sea level at the Hudson River 
(the average water elevation is 2 feet (0.61 m)),[107][112] which is still 
technically an estuary at Albany and is affected by the Atlantic tide.[113] 
The interior of Albany consists of rolling hills which were once part of 
the Albany Pine Bush, an area of pitch pine and scrub oak, and has arid, 
sandy soil that is a remnant of the ancient Lake Albany. Due to development, 
the Pine Bush has shrunk from an original 25,000 to 6,000 acres (10,100 
to 2,400 ha) today. A preserve was set up by the State Legislature in 1988 
and is located on the western edge of the city, spilling into Guilderland 
and Colonie;[114] it is the only sizable inland pine barrens sand dune 
ecosystem in the United States,[111] and is home to many endangered species, 
including the Karner Blue butterfly.[115] Albany is located in the humid 
continental climate zone (Köppen climate classification: Dfa),[116] and 
has cold, snowy winters, and hot, wet summers; the city experiences four 
distinct seasons. Albany is located in plant hardiness zone 6a near downtown 
and along the shore of the Hudson and 5b at its western end.[117] Albany 
receives 39.4 inches (1,000 mm) of rain per year,[118] with 138 days of 
at least 0.01 in (0.25 mm) of precipitation each year. Snowfall is significant, 
totaling 59.1 inches (150 cm) annually,[118] but with less accumulation 
than the lake-effect areas to the north and west, as it is further from 
Lake Ontario. However, Albany is close enough to the Atlantic coast to 
receive heavy snow from Nor'easters and the city occasionally receives 
Alberta clippers.[119] Winters can be very cold with fluctuating conditions; 
temperatures drop to 0 °F (−18 °C) or below on nine nights per annum.[120] 
Summers in Albany can contain stretches of excessive heat and humidity, 
with temperatures of 90 °F (32 °C) or hotter on nine days per year.[120] 
Record temperature extremes range from −28 °F (−33 °C), on January 19, 
1971, to 104 °F (40 °C) on July 4, 1911.[120] New York has an effective 
statewide crime rate of 385/100,000 people as of 2009[update].[122] Albany's 
violent crime rate is nearly on a par with Rochester (1028 violent crimes/100,000 
population vs 968/100,000 in Rochester) and much lower than Buffalo at 
1514/100,000. By comparison, New York City's violent crime rate was 639/100,000 
in 2013.[123] Albany's neighborhoods are varied demographically, geographically, 
architecturally, and historically. Downtown Albany is the city's oldest 
neighborhood, centered on State Street, one of Albany's oldest streets 
and its original main street. Today downtown consists mostly of office 
buildings inhabited by state agencies, though a recent push to bring in 
permanent residents has led to proposed apartments and condominiums.[124][125] 
North and south of Downtown are old residential communities often consisting 
of row houses. North is Sheridan Hollow, Arbor Hill, and North Albany; 
to the south is the super-neighborhood of the South End, which consists 
of a multitude of smaller neighborhoods including the Mansion District, 
the Pastures, Kenwood, Groesbeckville, Delaware Avenue, and Krank Park.[126][127] 
These neighborhoods tend to have more minorities and lower-income residents 
than the western, more suburbanized sections of the city.[128] West of 
Downtown is the Empire State Plaza, which effectively cuts Downtown off 
from the gentrified neighborhoods of Center Square, Hudson/Park, Lark Street, 
and Washington Park. Collectively referred to as mid-town, these neighborhoods 
are often compared to New York City's Greenwich Village for their eclectic 
mix of residential and commercial uses, including bars, night clubs, restaurants, 
and unique stores. Albany's gay culture is vibrant in this area.[129] Nearby 
Park South, a nine-block area surrounding New Scotland Avenue[127] is undergoing 
an urban renewal as existing housing units are removed or renovated and 
new office, commercial, and apartment buildings are added.[130] New construction 
includes expansion of Albany Medical Center, one of the largest employers 
in Albany. Nearby is University Heights, a united campus consisting of 
Albany Medical Center Hospital, Albany Medical College, Albany Law School, 
Albany College of Pharmacy, and the Sage College of Albany.[131] Western 
neighborhoods, such as Pine Hills, Delaware Avenue, Whitehall, Helderberg, 
New Scotland, and Beverwyck, tend to have larger lots and more suburban 
surroundings.[126] The eastern section of Pine Hills is a popular living 
choice for college students due to its proximity to the campuses of the 
College of Saint Rose and University at Albany.[132] Further west, the 
neighborhoods become more affluent and are dominated almost exclusively 
by single-family dwellings. These neighborhoods, such as Melrose, Western 
Pine Hills, New Albany, Eagle Hill, Westland Park, Campus, and Buckingham 
Pond more closely resemble neighboring areas of the suburban towns than 
they do the downtown parts of the city.[126] Further west is the W. Averell 
Harriman State Office Campus and the University at Albany's main campus.[127][133] 
Albany has more than 60 public parks and recreation areas.[135] Washington 
Park was organized as the Middle Public Square in 1806. Its current location 
has been public property since the Dongan Charter of 1686 gave the city 
title to all property not privately owned. Washington Park was designed 
by John Bogart and John Cuyler in 1870,[136] and opened for public use 
the following year. The original lake house, designed by Frederick W. Brown, 
was added in 1876. The park had previously been used as a cemetery; its 
graves were moved to Albany Rural Cemetery. Washington Park is a popular 
place to exercise and play sports; skate during the winter; people-watch 
during Tulip Fest; and attend plays at the amphitheater during the summer.[136][137][138][139] 
Other parks in Albany include Lincoln Park, Buckingham Park, the Corning 
Preserve, and the Pine Bush. Lincoln Park, southwest of the Empire State 
Plaza, was organized in 1886 and was originally known as Beaver Park.[140] 
Today, the park has a pool that is open during the summer months. Buckingham 
Lake Park is between Manning Boulevard and Route 85 in the Buckingham Pond 
neighborhood; it contains a pond with fountains, a footpath, a playground, 
and picnic tables.[141] The Albany Riverfront Park at the Corning Preserve 
has an 800-seat amphitheatre that hosts events in non-winter months, most 
notably the Alive at 5 summer concert series. The Preserve's visitors center 
details the ecology of the Hudson River and the local environment.[142] 
The park has a bike trail and boat launch[142] and was effectively separated 
from downtown by Interstate 787 until the opening of the Hudson River Way 
in 2002.[143] Other public parks include Westland Hill Park, Hoffman Park, 
Beverwyck Park, Ridgefield Park,[144] and Liberty Park, today a small circular 
grassy patch in downtown on Hudson Avenue, which is Albany's oldest park.[145] 
The municipal golf course, New Course at Albany, was constructed in 1929 
as the Albany Municipal Golf Course, later renamed the Capital Hills at 
Albany, and remodeled in 1991.[146] The Empire State Plaza, a collection 
of state agency office buildings, dominates almost any view of Albany. 
Built between 1965 and 1978 at the hand of Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller 
and architect Wallace Harrison, the complex is a powerful example of late 
American modern architecture[147] and remains a controversial building 
project both for displacing city residents and for its architectural style. 
The most recognizable aspect of the complex is the Erastus Corning Tower, 
the tallest building in New York outside of New York City.[147] Juxtaposed 
at the north end of the Plaza is the 19th-century New York State Capitol, 
the seat of the New York State Legislature and the home of the Governor's 
office.[148] Albany's initial architecture incorporated many Dutch influences, 
followed soon after by those of the English.[149] Quackenbush House, a 
Dutch Colonial brick mansion, was built c. 1736;[150] Schuyler Mansion, 
a Georgian-style mansion, was built in 1765;[151] and the oldest building 
currently standing in Albany is the 1728 Van Ostrande-Radliff House at 
48 Hudson Avenue.[152] Albany's housing varies greatly, with mostly row 
houses in the older sections of town, closer to the river. Housing type 
quickly changes as one travels westward, beginning with two-family homes 
of the late 19th century, and one-family homes built after World War II 
in the western end of the city.[153] Albany City Hall, designed by Henry 
Hobson Richardson, was opened in 1883. The New York State Capitol was opened 
in 1899 (after 32 years of construction)[148] at a cost of $25 million, 
making it the most expensive government building at the time.[154] Albany's 
Union Station, a major Beaux-Arts design,[155] was under construction at 
the same time; it opened in 1900. In 1912, the Beaux-Arts styled New York 
State Department of Education Building opened on Washington Avenue near 
the Capitol. It has a classical exterior, which features a block-long white 
marble colonnade.[156] The 1920s brought the Art Deco movement, which is 
illustrated by the Home Savings Bank Building (1927) on North Pearl Street[157] 
and the Alfred E. Smith Building (1930) on South Swan Street,[158] two 
of Albany's tallest high-rises.[159] Architecture from the 1960s and 1970s 
is well represented in the city, especially at the W. Averell Harriman 
State Office Building Campus (1950s and 1960s) and on the uptown campus 
of the University at Albany (1962–1971). The state office campus was planned 
in the 1950s by governor W. Averell Harriman to offer more parking and 
easier access for state employees.[160] The uptown SUNY campus was built 
in the 1960s under Governor Rockefeller on the site of the city-owned Albany 
Country Club. Straying from the popular open campus layout, SUNY Albany 
has a centralized building layout with administrative and classroom buildings 
at center surrounded by four student housing towers. The design called 
for much use of concrete and glass, and the style has slender, round-topped 
columns and pillars reminiscent of those at Lincoln Center in New York 
City.[161] Downtown has seen a revival in recent decades, often considered 
to have begun with Norstar Bank's renovation of the former Union Station 
as its corporate headquarters in 1986.[o] The Times Union Center (TU Center) 
was originally slated for suburban Colonie,[163] but was instead built 
downtown and opened in 1990.[164] Other development in downtown includes 
the construction of the State Dormitory Authority headquarters at 515 Broadway 
(1998);[165] the State Department of Environmental Conservation building, 
with its iconic green dome, at 625 Broadway (2001);[166] the State Comptroller 
headquarters on State Street (2001);[4] the Hudson River Way (2002), a 
pedestrian bridge connecting Broadway to the Corning Preserve;[143] and 
677 Broadway (2005), "the first privately owned downtown office building 
in a generation".[167][168] Historically, Albany's population has been 
mixed. First dominated by the Dutch and Germans, it was overtaken by the 
English in the early 19th century. Irish immigrants soon outnumbered most 
other ethnicities by the mid-19th century, and were followed by Italians 
and Poles. The mid-to-late 20th century saw a rise in the African-American 
population. As historian (and Albany Assemblyman) John McEneny puts it, 
Dutch and Yankee, German and Irish, Polish and Italian, black and Chinese—over 
the centuries Albany's heritage has reflected a succession of immigrant 
nationalities. Its streets have echoed with a dozen languages, its neighborhoods 
adapting to the distinctive life-style and changing economic fortunes of 
each new group.[173] Until after the Revolution, Albany's population consisted 
mostly of ethnic Dutch descendants. Settlers moving in from New England 
tipped the balance toward British ethnicity in the early 19th century.[174] 
Jobs on the turnpikes, canals, and railroads brought in floods of Irish 
immigrants in the early 19th century, especially in the 1840s during the 
Irish potato famine, solidifying the city's Irish base. Albany elected 
its first Irish Catholic mayor (Michael Nolan) two years before Boston 
did.[175] Polish and Italian immigrants began arriving in Albany in the 
wave of immigration in the latter part of the 19th century. Their numbers 
were smaller than in many other eastern cities mainly because most had 
found manufacturing jobs at General Electric in Schenectady.[176] The Jewish 
community, with Sephardic Jewish members part of the Beverwijck community, 
also saw a rise in population during the late 19th century, when many Ashkenazi 
Jews immigrated from eastern Europe.[176] In that period, there was also 
an influx of Chinese and east Asian immigrants, who settled in the downtown 
section of the city. Many of their descendants have since moved to suburban 
areas.[177] Immigration all but halted after the Immigration Act of 1924. 
Albany was also a destination of internal migration, as many African Americans 
moved north in their Great Migration from the rural South before and after 
World War I to fill industrial positions. As a percentage, the black community 
has grown substantially since then: African Americans made up 3 percent 
of the population in 1950, 6 percent in 1960, 12 percent in 1970, and 30 
percent in 2010. The change in proportion is related mostly to middle-class 
white families moving to the suburbs, and black families remaining within 
city limits during the same time period.[2][172] Since 2007 there has been 
an ever-growing number of Burmese refugees, mostly of the Karen ethnicity, 
with an estimate 5,000 now residing in Albany.[178][179] As of the 2010 
census,[172] there were 97,856 people residing in the city.[172] The population 
of the census area in 2009 was estimated to be 1,170,483.[3][21] The population 
density in 2010 was 4,572.7 per square mile (1,779.2/km²). There were 46,362 
housing units at an average density of 2,166.4 per square mile (842.9/km²); 
5,205 of these units (11.2%) were vacant. The racial makeup of the city 
residents was 52.3% white; 27% black or African American; 0.06% Native 
American or Native Alaskan; 7.4% Asian; 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Pacific 
Islander; .06% from other races; and 3.6% from two or more races. A total 
of 9.2% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.[p] Non-Hispanic 
Whites were 52.0% of the population in 2010,[106] compared to 87.0% in 
1970.[180] As of the 2000 census, the top five ancestry groups in the city 
were Irish (18.1%), Italian (12.4%), German (10.4%), English (5.2%), and 
Polish (4.3%); (33.1%) of the population reported "other ancestries". Albany 
is home to a Trique language-speaking community of Mexican-Americans.[181][182] 
The population had 20.0% under the age of 18, 19.3% from 18 to 24, 29.2% 
from 25 to 44, 18.1% from 45 to 64, and 13.4% who were 65 years of age 
or older. The median age was 31.4 years. For every 100 females there were 
90.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.5 males. 
Some 81.3% of the population had completed high school or earned an equivalency 
diploma.[172] There were 40,709 households in 2000, out of which 22.0% 
had children under the age of 18 living with them, 25.3% were married couples 
living together, 16.1% had a female householder with no husband present, 
and 54.8% were non-families. 41.9% of all households were made up of individuals 
and 11.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 2.11 and the average family size was 2.95.[172] 
The median income for a household in the city in 2000 was $71,203, and 
the median income for a family was $73,898 (male, year-round worker) and 
$67,035 (female, year-round worker). The per capita income for the city 
was $54,470.[183][q] About 16.0% of families and 21.7% of the population 
were below the poverty line, including 28.8% of those under age 18 and 
12.5% of those age 65 or over.[172] The rate of reported violent crimes 
for 2008 (1,095 incidents per 100,000 residents) is more than double the 
rate for similarly sized US cities. Reported property crimes (4,669 incidents 
per 100,000 residents) are somewhat lower.[184][185] Demographically speaking, 
the population of Albany and the Capital District mirrors the characteristics 
of the United States consumer population as a whole better than any other 
major municipality in the country. According to a 2004 study conducted 
by the Acxiom Corporation, Albany and its environs are the top-ranked standard 
test market for new business and retail products. Albany, Rochester, and 
Syracuse all scored within the top five.[186] Albany's geographic situation—roughly 
equidistant between New York City to the south and Montreal to the north, 
as well as approximately 4.5 hours east of Buffalo, and 2.5 hours west 
of Boston—makes it a convenient stop for nationally touring artists and 
acts. The Palace Theatre and The Egg provide mid-sized forums for music, 
theater, and spoken word performances, with the Capital Repertory Theatre 
filling the small-sized niche.[188] The TU Center serves as the city's 
largest musical venue for nationally and internationally prominent bands, 
and hosts trade shows, sporting events, and other large-scale community 
gatherings.[189] While some praise the cultural contributions of Albany 
and the greater Capital District,[99] others suggest that the city has 
a "cultural identity crisis" due to its massive geography and the need 
for a car (and driving time) to experience most of what the area has to 
offer, a necessity not seen in larger metropolitan areas like New York 
and Boston.[190] In recent years, the city's government has invested resources 
to cultivate venues and neighborhoods that attract after-hours business. 
Madison Avenue, Pearl Street, Delaware Avenue and Lark Street serve as 
the most active entertainment areas in the city. Many restaurants, clubs, 
and bars have opened since the mid-1990s, revitalizing numerous areas that 
had once been abandoned; various establishments have reclaimed old row 
houses, businesses, and even a pump station.[188] The bar scene generally 
incorporates three main strips. The downtown scene is focused on Pearl 
Street, stretching about two blocks. Up State Street, past the business 
district, is the Lark Street strip, home to smaller bars that fit into 
the neighborhood's artistic and eclectic style. Lastly, the midtown strip, 
with several bars located on Western and Madison Avenues, centers around 
the campuses of the College of Saint Rose and SUNY Albany's downtown campus. 
The midtown strip generally draws a younger crowd, as it is popular to 
the local college students.[191] Last call in Albany is 4:00 am nightly 
per New York law that sets that time as last call throughout the state 
by default, though counties may set an earlier time individual municipalities 
may not. Even though more than half of the state's counties have an earlier 
closing time, Albany County, as with all counties in the Capital District, 
has retained the 4:00 am last call time.[192] The Tulip Festival, one of 
Albany's largest festivals, is set in Washington Park and celebrates the 
city's Dutch heritage. This traditional Albany event marks the beginning 
of spring as thousands of tulips bloom in the park in early May.[193] Attendance 
to the festival in 2010 was approximately 80,000.[194] Alive at 5 is a 
free, weekly concert series held downtown during the summer on Thursdays.[195] 
With 10 concerts in 2010 total attendance was roughly 100,000.[194] The 
Price Chopper Fabulous Fourth and Fireworks Festival at the Empire State 
Plaza celebrates Independence Day with musical performances and the region's 
largest fireworks display.[187] Freihofer's Run for Women is a 5-kilometer 
run through the city that draws more than 4,000 participants from across 
the country; it is an annual event that began in 1978.[196]The Albany Chefs' 
Food & Wine Festival: Wine & Dine for the Arts is an annual Festival that 
hosts more than 3500 people over 3 days. The Festival showcases more than 
70 Regional Chefs & Restaurants, 250 Global Wines & Spirits, a NYS Craft 
Beer Pavilion, 4 competitions (The Signature Chef Invitational, Rising 
Star Chef, Barista Albany and Battle of the Bartenders) and one Grand Gala 
Reception, Dinner & Auction featuring 10 f Albany's Iconic Chefs. The Albany 
Chefs' Food & Wine Festival donates all net proceeds to deserving Albany 
Arts Organizations and is held the Thursday-Saturday preceding Martin Luther 
King Weekend. Smaller events include the African American Family Day Arts 
Festival each August at the Empire State Plaza;[187] the Latin Fest, held 
each August at the Corning Preserve;[197] the Albany Jazz Festival, an 
annual end-of-summer event held at the Corning Preserve;[198] Lark Fest, 
a music and art festival held each fall;[199] and the Capital Pride Parade 
and Festival, a major gay pride event, held each June.[200] The once-popular 
First Night, celebrating the New Year holiday each December 31, was replaced 
by the Albany Winterfest in 2006 due to declining interest;[201] Winterfest 
occurs each year on December 30.[202] Because of Albany's historical and 
political significance, the city has numerous museums, historical buildings, 
and historic districts. Albany is home to the New York State Museum, the 
New York State Library and the New York State Archives; all three facilities 
are located in the Cultural Education Center at the south end of Empire 
State Plaza and are free to the public.[204] The USS Slater (DE-766), a 
decommissioned World War II destroyer escort that was restored in 1998, 
is a museum ship docked in the Hudson River at Quay Street. It is the only 
ship of its kind still afloat.[205] The Albany Heritage Area Visitors Center, 
located at the corner of Clinton Avenue and Broadway at Quackenbush Square, 
hosts a museum, gift shop, and the Henry Hudson Planetarium.[206] In early 
2012, the Irish American Heritage Museum opened in downtown Albany. The 
museum is home to exhibits highlighting the contributions of the Irish 
people in America.[207] The Albany Institute of History and Art, located 
on Washington Avenue near the Center Square Neighborhood and State Capitol, 
is "dedicated to collecting, preserving, interpreting and promoting interest 
in the history, art, culture of Albany and the Upper Hudson Valley region." 
The museum's most notable permanent exhibits include an extensive collection 
of paintings by the Hudson River School and an exhibit on Ancient Egypt 
featuring the Institute's "Albany Mummies." Albany is home to 57 listings 
on the National Register of Historic Places[208] (NRHP) and five National 
Historic Landmarks.[209] The Ten Broeck Mansion, a 1797 Federal-style mansion 
(later renovated in the Greek-Revival style) built for Abraham Ten Broeck 
(mayor of Albany 1779–1783 and 1796–1798)[210] is currently a historic 
house museum and the headquarters of the Albany County Historical Association;[203] 
it was added to the NRHP in 1971.[211] Later known as "Arbor Hill", it 
gave the current neighborhood its name.[212] Albany has been the subject, 
inspiration, or location for many written and cinematic works. Many non-fiction 
works have been written on the city. One of the city's more notable claims 
to fame is Ironweed (1983), the 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Albany 
native William Kennedy. Ironweed was the third in a series of books by 
Kennedy known as the "Albany Cycle".[213][214] The elusive author Trevanian 
also grew up in Albany and wrote The Crazyladies of Pearl Street (2005), 
about a North Albany neighborhood along Pearl Street. The book is considered 
a semi-autobiographical memoir.[215] Gregory Maguire, author of Wicked: 
The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (inspiration for the 
Broadway hit Wicked), grew up in North Albany[216] and graduated from SUNY 
Albany in 1976.[217] In 1987, the film version of Ironweed premiered at 
the Palace Theatre.[218] The movie starred Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep, 
each of whom were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances;[219] 
much of the filming was done on location in Albany.[218] Most recently 
the downtown area was the site of filming for the action-thriller Salt, 
starring Angelina Jolie,[220] and the action-comedy The Other Guys, starring 
Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg.[221] Authors Herman Melville and Henry 
James lived in Albany. Isabel Archer, the heroine of James' novel The Portrait 
of a Lady, is from Albany.[222] The City School District of Albany (CSDA) 
operates the city's public school system, which consists of 17 schools 
and learning centers;[223] in addition, there are 7 charter schools.[224] 
[r] In the 2015-16 school year, over 9,000 students were enrolled in the 
public school system.[223] The district had an average class size of 18,[228] 
an 81-percent graduation rate,[s] and a 5-percent dropout rate.[229] The 
district's 2010–11 budget is $202.8 million.[230] Although considered by 
the state to be one of the lowest-achieving high schools in New York, Albany 
High was listed as the nation's 976th best high school in a 2010 Newsweek/Washington 
Post report.[231] Albany also has a number of private schools, including 
the coed Bishop Maginn High School and Albany Free School; the all-boys 
Albany Academy;[t] and the all-girls Academy of the Holy Names and Albany 
Academy for Girls.[233] Albany has a prominent history in higher education 
and was ranked third in a Forbes survey called "The Best Places with the 
Best Education" in 2005;[235] it ranked top on Forbes' "IQ Campuses" list 
as part of its 150 Cheap Places to Live series in 2006.[236] The Albany 
Medical College (private), today part of Albany Medical Center, was founded 
in 1838. Albany Law School (private) is the oldest law school in New York 
and the fourth-oldest in the country; it was opened in 1851. President 
William McKinley was an alumnus. The Albany College of Pharmacy and Health 
Sciences (private) is the second-oldest pharmacy school in New York and 
the fifteenth-oldest in the United States. The New York State Normal School, 
one of the oldest teachers colleges in the United States, opened in 1905; 
it was later known as the State Teachers College. It eventually evolved 
into the University at Albany, also known as SUNY Albany (public), which 
inherited the Normal School's original downtown campus on Western Avenue. 
The center of the campus moved to its current Uptown Campus in the west 
end of the city in 1970. SUNY Albany is a unit of the State University 
of New York and one of only four university centers in the system.[234] 
Other colleges and universities in Albany include Empire State College, 
The College of Saint Rose, Excelsior College, Maria College, Mildred Elley, 
and Sage College of Albany. Nearby Hudson Valley Community College (HVCC) 
fills the community college niche in the Albany-Troy area.[237] The effect 
of the campuses on the city's population is substantial: Combining the 
student bodies of all the aforementioned campuses (except HVCC) results 
in 63,149 students, or almost 70 percent of the 2008 estimate of Albany's 
permanent population.[238] Albany's economy, along with that of the Capital 
District in general, is heavily dependent on government, health care, education, 
and more recently, technology. Because of these typically steady economic 
bases, the local economy has been relatively immune to national economic 
recessions in the past.[240] More than 25 percent of the city's population 
works in government-related positions.[241] The current recession has been 
more difficult to deal with because of the many issues on Wall Street, 
from which the state government receives much of its tax revenue. In March 
2010, the Albany area had the lowest unemployment rate of any major metropolitan 
area in New York, at 7.8%, compared to 9.4% in New York as a whole.[242] 
Albany's estimated daytime population is more than 162,000. Companies based 
in Albany include Trans World Entertainment and Clough Harbour. Since the 
2000s, the economy of Albany and the surrounding Capital District has been 
redirected toward a high technology focus. Tech Valley is a marketing name 
for the eastern part of New York State, encompassing Albany, the Capital 
District, and the Hudson Valley.[243] Originated in 1998 to promote the 
greater Albany area as a high-tech competitor to regions such as Silicon 
Valley and Boston, it has since grown to represent the counties in the 
Capital District and extending to 19 counties from IBM's Westchester County 
plants in the south to the Canada–US border in the north. The area's high 
technology ecosystem is supported by technologically focused academic institutions 
including Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the State University of 
New York Polytechnic Institute.[244] Tech Valley encompasses 19 counties 
straddling both sides of the Adirondack Northway and the New York Thruway,[243] 
and with heavy state taxpayer subsidy, has experienced significant growth 
in the computer hardware side of the high-technology industry,[240] with 
great strides in the nanotechnology sector, digital electronics design, 
and water- and electricity-dependent integrated microchip circuit manufacturing.[245] 
In 2012, the Albany-Schenectady area was listed fourth on Forbes Magazine's 
annual "Best Cities for Jobs" list, noting that job losses in state and 
local government were overcome by expansion of the high-tech field.[246] 
Albany has a mayor-council form of government, which currently functions 
under a charter adopted in 1998. The 1998 charter completely overwrote 
the original 17th-century Dongan Charter. However, in an effort to keep 
Dongan in effect, the new charter was applied strictly as an amendment 
to Dongan, meaning Dongan is technically still in effect, giving Albany 
the distinction of having the oldest active city charter in the United 
States and "arguably the longest-running instrument of municipal government 
in the Western Hemisphere."[12][247] The mayor, who is elected every four 
years, heads the executive branch of city government.[248] The current 
mayor, Kathy Sheehan, was first elected in 2013. She replaced former mayor 
Gerald Jennings who was mayor for 20 years from 1994 to 2013.[249] The 
Common Council represents the legislative branch of city government and 
is made up of fifteen council members (each elected from one ward) and 
an at-large Common Council President.[247] The current president is Carolyn 
McLaughlin;[250] she began her term in January 2010.[251] While Albany 
has its own city government, it has also been the seat of Albany County 
since the county's formation in 1683 and the capital of New York since 
1797. As such, the city is home to all branches of the county and state 
governments, as well as its own. Albany City Hall sits on Eagle Street, 
opposite the State Capitol,[252] and the Albany County Office Building 
is on State Street.[253] The state government has offices scattered throughout 
the city. Albany is in the 20th Congressional district, represented by 
Paul Tonko (D) in the United States House of Representatives. The city 
is represented by Chuck Schumer (D)[254] and Kirsten Gillibrand (D)[255] 
in the United States Senate. On the state level, the city is in the 44th 
district in the New York Senate, represented by Neil Breslin (D). In the 
New York Assembly, the western portion of the city is in the 109th district, 
represented by Patricia Fahy (D) and the eastern portion is in the 108th 
district, represented by John T. McDonald, III (D). As the seat of Albany 
County, the city is the location of the county's courts including Family 
Court, County Court, Surrogate Court, Supreme Court, and Court of Appeals.[256] 
Albany is the site of a United States district court for the Northern District 
of New York courthouse.[257] Albany's politics have been dominated by the 
Democratic Party since the 1920s; Daniel (Uncle Dan) O'Connell established 
a political machine in the city with the election of William Stormont Hackett 
as mayor in 1922.[258] Prior to that, William (Billy) Barnes had set up 
a Republican machine in the 1890s. Barnes' success is attributed to the 
fact that he owned two newspapers in Albany and that he was the grandson 
of Thurlow Weed, the influential newspaper publisher and political boss.[259] 
O'Connell's organization overcame Barnes' in 1922 and survived well into 
the 1980s (even after his death), as the machine put forth candidates for 
whom the electorate dutifully voted. In many instances, votes were outright 
bought;[260] it was not uncommon for the machine to "buy poor folks' loyalty 
and trust with a fiver".[261] Gerald Jennings' upset in the 1993 Democratic 
mayoral primary over Harold Joyce, who had the Democratic Party's formal 
endorsement and had only recently been its county chairman, is often cited 
as the end of the O'Connell era in Albany.[262] Albany continues to be 
dominated by the Democratic party as enrollment in the city was 38,862 
in 2009 compared to Republican enrollment of 3,487.[263] This gives Democrats 
a 10–1 advantage in the general election. Every elected city position has 
been held by a Democrat since 1931.[264] In November 2013, Kathy Sheehan 
became the first woman to be elected Mayor of Albany.[265] Like most cities 
of comparable age and size, Albany has well-established Orthodox Christian, 
Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish communities. Albany is home to the 
oldest Christian congregation in Upstate New York and the Mother Churches 
of two Christian dioceses. As of June 2010[update], eight churches or religious 
buildings in the city were listed on the National Register of Historic 
Places,[208] one of which—St. Peter's Episcopal Church on State Street—is 
a National Historic Landmark.[209] Established in 1642,[267] the congregation 
of the First Church in Albany (Reformed), also known as the North Dutch 
Church (located on North Pearl Street), is the second-oldest Reformed Church 
in America.[266] The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Eagle Street 
and Madison Avenue, built 1852) is the cathedral of the Roman Catholic 
diocese, led by Bishop Howard J. Hubbard,[268][269] and the Cathedral of 
All Saints (South Swan Street and Elk Street, built 1888) is the cathedral 
of the Episcopal diocese, led by Bishop William Love.[270][271] The city 
is home to eleven Catholic churches[272] and six Episcopal churches.[273] 
A significant Jewish presence has existed in Albany since as early as 1658,[274] 
and today includes many synagogues; there are two Conservative, a Chabad-Lubavitch, 
an Orthodox, and two Reform synagogues.[275] Albany is also home to one 
of the few Karaite synagogues outside Israel.[276] The city has a membership 
of between 12,000 and 13,000.[274] Exact numbers on religious denominations 
in Albany are not readily available. Demographic statistics in the United 
States depend heavily on the United States Census Bureau, which cannot 
ask about religious affiliation as part of its decennial census.[277] It 
does compile some national and statewide religious statistics,[278] but 
these are not representative of a city the size of Albany. One report from 
2000 offers religious affiliations for Albany County. According to the 
data, 59.2% of Albany County residents identified as Christian: 47% are 
Roman Catholic, 8.4% are mainline Protestants, 2.7% are Evangelical Protestants, 
and 1.1% are Eastern or Oriental Orthodox Christians. Residents who practice 
Judaism make up 4.2% of the population and Muslims represent 0.2%.[279] 
Note that these values are county-wide; city values could be significantly 
different. The Times Union is Albany's primary daily newspaper and the 
only one based close to the city; its headquarters moved from within city 
limits to suburban Colonie in the 1960s after a dispute with Mayor Corning 
over land needed for expansion.[280] Its circulation totals about 73,000 
on weekdays and 143,000 on Sundays.[281] Serving Albany to a lesser degree 
are The Daily Gazette, based in Schenectady,[282] and The Record, of Troy.[283] 
Metroland is the alternative newsweekly in the area, publishing each Thursday,[284] 
while The Business Review is a business weekly published each Friday.[285] 
The Legislative Gazette, another weekly newspaper, focuses exclusively 
on issues related to the Legislature and the state government.[286] The 
Albany-Schenectady-Troy media market is the 63rd-largest in the country 
in terms of radio[287] and the 57th-largest in terms of television audiences.[288] 
It is a broadcast market with historical significance. The pioneering influence 
of General Electric in Schenectady directly contributed to the area emerging 
as the birthplace of station-based television with WRGB; the station was 
also the first affiliate of NBC.[289] In 1947, the region was home to the 
first independently owned and operated commercial FM radio station in the 
United States: W47A.[289] WGY was the second commercial radio station in 
New York and the twelfth in the nation.[289] The Capital District is home 
to ABC affiliate WTEN 10,[290] CBS affiliate WRGB 6 (also operating CW 
affiliate WCWN 45),[291] Fox affiliate WXXA 23,[292] NBC affiliate WNYT 
13 (also operating MyNetworkTV affiliate WNYA 51),[293] and PBS member 
station WMHT 17. Time Warner Cable hosts Time Warner Cable News Capital 
Region, the area's only local 24-hour news channel.[294] The area has numerous 
radio stations. The Northway (Interstate 87 north of the New York State 
Thruway) connects Albany by car to Canada at Champlain; Autoroute 15 continues 
into Quebec, linking Albany to Montreal. Interstate 90 connects Albany 
to both Buffalo and Boston, via the New York State Thruway and the Massachusetts 
Turnpike respectively, both of which use I-90 (the NYS Thruway partially, 
the Massachusetts Turnpike fully). South of Albany, I-87 becomes part of 
the Thruway and ends at Interstate 278 in the Bronx. Albany is literally 
at the crossroad of I-87 and I-90, creating a junction between Buffalo 
and Boston, and Montreal and New York. Interstate 787 links Albany to Watervliet, 
Colonie, and Menands; by way of Route 7, I-787 connects to the Northway, 
offering Saratoga County residents a rather direct, albeit congested route 
to and from Albany during rush hour.[133] Albany, long an important Hudson 
River port, today serves domestic and international ships and barges through 
the Port of Albany-Rensselaer, located on both sides of the river. The 
port has the largest mobile harbor crane in the state of New York.[296] 
The New York State Barge Canal, the ultimate successor of the Erie Canal, 
is in use today, largely by tourist and private boats.[297] With the closure 
of Union Station on Broadway, area passenger-rail service is provided by 
Amtrak at the Albany-Rensselaer station in Rensselaer. In 2009, the station 
saw more than 720,000 passengers, making it Amtrak's second-busiest in 
New York, behind New York's Penn Station.[298] Low cost curbside bus service 
from the SUNY Albany campus and the Rensselaer station is also provided 
by Megabus, with direct service to New York City. Albany's nearest airport 
is Albany International Airport in Colonie. Six major airlines service 
Albany: Cape Air, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airlines, 
United Air Lines, and US Airways; Million Air is the local fixed-base operator.[299] 
In 2010, Albany had the highest average airfare in New York, though the 
per-mile cost on its busiest routes was second-lowest in the state.[300] 
The Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA) provides bus service 
throughout Albany and the surrounding area, including Schenectady, Troy, 
and Saratoga Springs.[301] The city was once served by an urban streetcar 
service maintained by the United Traction Company. As in many American 
cities, after the advent of the automobile, light rail services declined 
in Albany and were replaced by bus and taxi services.[302] Greyhound Lines,[303] 
Trailways,[304] Peter Pan,[305] Short Line, Vermont Translines, and Yankee 
Trails[306] buses all serve a downtown terminal. Brown Coach provides commuter 
service.[307] Albany has no major league professional sports teams, and 
minor league teams have low support.[310] The only minor league team currently 
active are the Albany Devils ice hockey team, which moved to the city for 
the 2010–2011 season. They play in the American Hockey League and are affiliated 
with the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League.[311][312] The 
Devils replaced the Albany River Rats, who played in the Capital Region 
from 1990 to 2010, when they relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina. The 
Albany Firebirds played in the Arena Football League from 1990 to 2000, 
while a second team, originally known as the Albany Conquest and later 
the Firebirds, played in af2, the AFL's developmental league, from 2002 
to 2009. The Tri-City ValleyCats short season minor league baseball team 
have played at the Joseph L. Bruno Stadium on the Hudson Valley Community 
College campus in North Greenbush since 2002. Prior to the ValleyCats' 
arrival, the Albany-Colonie Diamond Dogs (1995–2002) played at Heritage 
Park in Colonie; due to financial pressures, and facing impending competition 
from the ValleyCats, the franchise folded in 2002.[313] The local basketball 
team is the Albany Legends (International Basketball League), who play 
in the Washington Avenue Armory.[314] The Albany Patroons were two basketball 
teams that played at the Armory. Both folded due to financial problems.[315] 
With the large number of local colleges and universities around Albany, 
college sports are popular. The University at Albany's Great Danes currently 
play at the Division I level in all sports. The football team is a member 
of the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA), while all other sports teams 
play as members of the America East Conference (AEC).[316] In 2006, UAlbany 
became the first SUNY-affiliated school to send a team to the NCAA Division 
I Men's Basketball Tournament.[317] UAlbany has also hosted the New York 
Giants training camp since 1996.[318] The Siena Saints have seen a rise 
in popularity after their men's basketball team made it to the NCAA Men's 
Division I Basketball Championship (March Madness) in 2008, 2009, and 2010.[319] 
All 18 Saints teams are Division I and play in the Metro Atlantic Athletic 
Conference (MAAC).[320] Although Siena's campus is in nearby Colonie, the 
men's basketball team plays at the TU Center.[308] Albany has five official 
sister city agreements and two other twin-city relationships. The city 
of Nijmegen, Netherlands connected with Albany following World War II. 
With the help of the Catholic university in Albany, the Catholic University 
of Nijmegen (Radboud University Nijmegen) rebuilt its partly destroyed 
library, with over 50,000 books being donated to the Dutch university. 
To show its gratitude for post-war assistance, the city sent Albany 50,000 
tulip bulbs in 1948; this act led to the establishment of the annual Tulip 
Festival.[99] Most of the other connections were made in the 1980s during 
Mayor Whalen's term in office as part of his cultural expansion program.[99] 
The official sister cities are:[321] The additional twin-city relationships 
are with:[99] Government Economy Culture Travel News Hamlet of Karner;
