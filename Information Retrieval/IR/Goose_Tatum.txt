Reece "Goose"[1] Tatum (May 31, 1921 – January 18, 1967) was an African 
American multi-sport athlete. Born in El Dorado, Arkansas, Tatum played 
Negro League Baseball before becoming a star basketball player with the 
Harlem Globetrotters.[2] Goose and Satchel Paige were teammates. Tatum 
is considered to be the original "clown prince"—a term first applied to 
seminal Chicago Crusader/Philadelphia Giant Jackie Bethards in 1933[3]—of 
the Trotters. He wove numerous comic routines into his play, of which many 
would reach cult status. Some of these routines were based on his stature—at 
6'4", it is reported that he had an arm span of about 84 inches (210 cm) 
and could touch his kneecaps without bending. He is credited with inventing 
the hook shot. Tatum and Marques Haynes, who were both Harlem Globetrotters 
superstars, formed a barnstorming basketball team of their own: The Fabulous 
Harlem Magicians. Dempsey Hovland owner of 20th Century Booking Agency 
was recruited to book the Harlem Magicians' games. Hovland earlier had 
managed the barnstorming House of David basketball team. Dempsey Hovland 
was also the creator and owner of The World Famous Texas Cowgirls Basketball 
Team. In 1966, Tatum's son, Goose Jr., was killed in a car accident. Soon 
after, Tatum began drinking heavily which led to a series of hospital visits. 
He died at his home in El Paso, Texas on January 18, 1967 at the age of 
45. The official autopsy stated that he died of natural causes. A veteran 
of the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II, Tatum was interred in the 
Fort Bliss National Cemetery.[4] In 2011, Tatum was elected to the Basketball
