Cecil Carlton Hughson, (February 9, 1916 – August 6, 1993), was a Major 
League Baseball starting pitcher who played his entire career in the American 
League with the Boston Red Sox (1941–44, 1946–49). He batted and threw 
right-handed. A native of Kyle, Texas, Hughson played collegiately at the 
University of Texas at Austin. He was a successful and competitive major 
league pitcher who was not averse to throwing close to batters, changing 
speeds by mixing a hard fastball with an overhand curveball. At the height 
of his career, arm and shoulder injuries threatened permanent disability 
and hastened his retirement. Hughson enjoyed his best season in 1942, posting 
a 22–6 record with a 2.59 ERA, and also leading the league in victories, 
strikeouts (113), complete games (22), innings pitched (281.0) and batters 
faced (1150). In 1943, he won 12 games with 114 strikeouts and a 2.64 ERA, 
and again led the league in complete games (20). He also had his best year 
batting, posting career highs in hits, runs, doubles, walks, batting average 
and RBI's. He led the league in winning percentage ( 18-5,.783) and WHIP 
(9.43), and also had a career-best ERA of 2.26. After serving in the military 
in 1945, he won 20 games in 1946, led the league in walks per nine innings 
(1.65), set a career high in strikeouts with 172, and completed 21 of 35 
starts. His several 1-0 shutouts led to an early pennant-clinching for 
the Red Sox. But he fell to 12 wins in 1947, and finished his career when 
only 33 after two seasons in relief. In an eight-year career, he posted 
a 96–54 won-lost record with 693 strikeouts and a 2.94 ERA in 1375.2 innings. 
His control was good enough for an effective 1.86 strikeout-to-walk ratio 
(693-to-372). He was an American League All-Star for three consecutive 
years (1942–44). After retirement from baseball, he joined his dad and 
uncle at Hughson Meat Company in San Marcos, Texas in the 1950s. Sometime 
in the 1990s, after the slaughter plant's closure, the 40 acres of land 
it had occupied were designated as greenspace and are now known as Ringtail 
Ridge Natural Area. The foundations of the plant and other artifacts can 
still be seen. He was one of the first in the United States to raise Charolois 
cattle. He served on the local school Board of Trustees in the 1950s where 
he was one who led the effort to integrate the public schools. In the 60's 
he developed part of his ranch into the Hughson Heights subdivision. He 
died in San Marcos at age 77, and is buried in San Marcos Cemetery. He 
was enshrined in the University of Texas Hall of Honor in 1970', the Texas 
Sports Hall of Fame in 1987, and the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in November
