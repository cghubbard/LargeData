Leonard Eugene Alley (born July 10, 1940 in Richmond, Virginia) is a former 
professional baseball player. He spent his entire Major League Baseball 
(MLB) career (1963–73) as a shortstop for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Alley 
was a modest hitter but an exceptionally steady shortstop with good range 
and an accurate throwing arm. He won two Gold Glove Awards at shortstop 
(1966–67) and garnered two All-Star appearances primarily on the strength 
of his glove. He spent most of his career turning double plays with Baseball 
Hall of Fame second baseman Bill Mazeroski, and the duo set an MLB record 
of 161 double plays in a season in 1966 that still stands (when the Pirates 
set a National League record with 215 total double plays). They also joined 
a select list of eight shortstop-second baseman duos to each win a Gold 
Glove the same season while playing together twice (1967–68). Shoulder 
and knee problems ultimately ended his career and prevented him from realizing 
his full potential. On September 2, 1970, Alley hit an inside-the-park 
grand slam at Jarry Park in Montreal,against the Montreal Expos. With the 
bases loaded, facing Carl Morton, Alley hit a line drive which landed in 
front of center fielder Boots Day, who slipped on the wet grass. The ball 
rolled all the way to the wall in deepest center field, and all the baserunners 
and Alley scored. In 1998, Alley was inducted into the Virginia Sports
