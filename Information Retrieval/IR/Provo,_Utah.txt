Provo /ˈproʊvoʊ/ is the third-largest city in the U.S. state of Utah, located 
43 miles (69 km) south of Salt Lake City along the Wasatch Front. Provo 
is the largest city and county seat of Utah County. It lies between the 
cities of Orem to the north and Springville to the south. With a population 
at the 2010 census of 112,488,[2] Provo is the principal city in the Provo-Orem 
metropolitan area, which had a population of 526,810 residents at the 2010 
census.[6] It is the third-largest metropolitan area in Utah after Salt 
Lake City and Ogden-Clearfield. The city is the location of Brigham Young 
University, a private higher education institution, which is operated by 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Provo also 
has the largest Missionary Training Center for the LDS Church. The city 
is a key operational center for Novell and has been a focus area for technology 
development in Utah, with several billion dollar startups operating in 
Provo.[7] Provo was the second city in the United States to work with Google 
Fiber. The city's Peaks Ice Arena was a venue for the Salt Lake City Winter 
Olympics in 2002. Sundance Resort is located 13 miles (21 km) northeast 
at Provo Canyon. In 2015, Provo was cited among the "Best Small And Medium-Size 
Cities For Jobs,"[8] and Utah County, where Provo is the largest municipality, 
was named by the BLS for highest job growth for the year.[9] In 2009, Provo 
was listed in Where to Retire magazine as an "enticing city for new careers". 
Provo was also listed in National Geographic Adventure magazine's "where 
to live and play" as a cultural hub.[10] In 2010, Forbes rated Provo one 
of the top 10 places to raise a family.[11] Additionally, in 2013, Forbes 
ranked Provo the No. 2 city on its list of Best Places for Business and 
Careers.[12] Provo was ranked first for community optimism (2012),[13] 
first for volunteerism (2008),[14] 2nd for business/careers (2010),[15] 
and first in health/well-being (2014).[16] Its metropolitan area was projected 
to have the greatest population increase in the 2010 United States Census 
(47%). The area was originally called Timpanogots (meaning rocky) and was 
inhabited by the Timpanogos. (meaning fish eaters)[17] It was the largest 
and most settled area in modern-day Utah.[18] The ample food from the Provo 
River made the Timpanogos a peaceful people.[17] The area also served as 
the traditional meeting place for the Ute and Shoshone tribes and as a 
spot to worship their creator.[19] Father Silvestre Velez de Escalante, 
a Spanish Franciscan missionary-explorer, is considered the first European 
explorer to have visited the area, in 1776. Escalante chronicled this first 
European exploration across the Great Basin desert. The Europeans did not 
build a permanent settlement, but traded with the Timpanogos whom they 
called Lagunas (lake people) or Come Pescado (fish eaters).[18] In 1847, 
the Mormon Pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, which was just north 
of Timpanogos. At first, they were friendly with the Mormons, until Brigham 
Young ordered the Battle Creek Massacre, in modern-day Pleasant Grove, 
Utah. The Mormons continued pushing into Timpanog lands. In 1849, 33 Mormon 
families from Salt Lake City established Fort Utah. In 1850, Brigham Young 
sent an army from Salt Lake to drive out the Timpanogos in what is called 
the Provo War.[20] The ruthlessness of the Mormon invaders angered the 
Timpanog, which contributed to the Walker War and Black Hawk War. Fort 
Utah was renamed Provo in 1850 for Étienne Provost, an early French-Canadian 
trapper who arrived in the region in 1825. Provo lies in the Utah Valley 
at an elevation of 4,549 feet (1,387 m). According to the United States 
Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 44.2 square miles (114.4 km2), 
of which 41.7 square miles (107.9 km2) is land and 2.5 square miles (6.5 km2), 
or 5.66%, is water.[21] The Wasatch Range contains many peaks within Utah 
County along the east side of the Wasatch Front. One of these peaks, known 
as Y Mountain, towers over the city. There is a large hillside letter Y 
made of whitewashed concrete halfway up the steep mountain, built in the 
early part of the 20th century to commemorate Brigham Young University 
(original plans included construction of all three letters: BYU). Wild 
deer (and less frequently, cougars, and moose) still roam the mountains 
(and occasionally the city streets). The scenery allows for hiking, skiing, 
fishing and other outdoor activities. At the 2010 census,[4] 112,488 people,
