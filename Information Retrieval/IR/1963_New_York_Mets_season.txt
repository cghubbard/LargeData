The 1963 New York Mets season was the second regular season for the Mets. 
They went 51â€“111 and finished 10th in the NL, 48 games behind the World 
Series Champion Los Angeles Dodgers. They were managed by Casey Stengel. 
They played their home games at the Polo Grounds, the second and final 
season there for the Mets before moving to Shea Stadium the following season. 
On June 14, Duke Snider of the Mets hit his 400th home run against the 
Cincinnati Reds. The opposing pitcher was Bob Purkey. The homer came in 
the 6,783rd at bat of his career.[4] Snider became the ninth player to 
reach 400 homers. Along with Eddie Mathews, Snider became part of the first 
duo to reach the 400-plateau in the same season.[4] Afterwards, Mets outfielder 
Jimmy Piersall told Snider that he could get more publicity for his 100th 
home run.[5] Nine days later, on June 23, Piersall ran the bases backward 
after hitting the 100th home run of his career off Philadelphia Phillies 
pitcher Dallas Green.[6] He was released by the Mets one month later, with 
that home run being the only one he hit in a Mets uniform. Infielders Coaches
