Andrés José Padovani Galarraga (Spanish: [anˈdɾez ɣalaˈraɣa]; born June 
18, 1961) is a former Major League Baseball first baseman who played for 
the Montreal Expos (1985–1991 and 2002), St. Louis Cardinals (1992), Colorado 
Rockies (1993–1997), Atlanta Braves (1998–2000), Texas Rangers (2001), 
San Francisco Giants (2001 and 2003) and Anaheim Angels (2004). He batted 
and threw right-handed. At six-foot-three and 235 pounds (1.91 m, 117 kg), 
Galarraga began his professional career in Venezuela at the age of 16. 
Despite several injuries that plagued Galarraga throughout his career, 
he was a very popular player both for his achievements on the field, and 
for his big and bright smile. He was nicknamed The Big Cat (textually translated 
from English as El Gran Gato, although his nickname in his native Venezuela 
was El Gato) for his extraordinary quickness at first base in spite of 
his big frame. Galarraga was a five time All-Star, won two National League 
Gold Glove Awards and two NL Silver Slugger Awards, and won the MLB Comeback 
Player of the Year Award after his successful return to baseball following 
cancer treatment. Galarraga was signed by the Leones del Caracas club as 
a catcher and third baseman. He made his debut in the 1978–1979 season. 
Some of the players he had as teammates included big-leaguers Tony Armas, 
Bo Díaz, Manny Trillo, Gonzalo Márquez and Leo Hernández. Galarraga originally 
started as a utility player, but three seasons later he became the regular 
first baseman of the team. At the recommendation of team manager Felipe 
Alou, he was signed by the Expos in 1979.[1] At that time, some MLB scouts 
thought that the 17-year-old power-hitting prodigy was too overweight to 
play professionally. In the minors, Galarraga played for West Palm Beach 
(1979, 1982–1983), Calgary (1979–1980), Jamestown (1981), Jacksonville 
(1984) and Indianapolis (1985). Galarraga earned the Montreal job by being 
named Double-A Southern League Most Valuable Player for Jacksonville in 
1984, with .289 batting average, 27 home runs and 87 RBI. He also led the 
league in total bases (271), slugging percentage (.508), intentional base 
on balls (10), hit by pitches (9), and in double plays (130) and total 
chances (1428) on first base. Prior to his majors promotion, he hit .269, 
25, 85 with Indianapolis in 121 games, being named Rookie of the Year in 
the Triple-A International League. The Big Cat made his debut with Montreal 
on August 23, 1985. That year Galarraga struggled, hitting .187 (14-for-75) 
with two homers and four RBI in 24 games. He had a promising start in 1986, 
but it was halted when he suffered a knee injury. Galarraga had eight home 
runs and was leading all NL rookies in runs batted in (25) when he suffered 
the knee injury. Galarraga received arthroscopic surgery on the knee on 
July 10. He was activated one month later, only to be re-injured the following 
day after pulling muscles in his rib cage. He returned to action in September, 
ending with .271, 10 HR, and 42 RBI in 105 games. Overshadowed by some 
teammates, Galarraga survived a tough rookie year and quietly enjoyed a 
consistently strong 1987 season. He hit .305, 13 HR, 90 RBI, finishing 
second in the league in doubles (40). Despite his size, he displayed solid 
defense, being adept at scooping throws out of the dirt and excellent quickness 
turning the 3-6-3 double play. Cardinals' manager Whitey Herzog called 
him "the best-fielding right-handed first baseman I've seen since Gil Hodges." 
In 1988, Galarraga emerged from the shadows to become the best player on 
the Expos. He had an MVP-type season with a .302 batting average, 99 runs, 
92 RBI, and 29 home runs. He also led the league in hits (184) and doubles 
(42), and earned an All-Star berth for the first time in his career. He 
was named the Montreal Expos Player of the Year at the end of the season. 
1989 was a rough season however for the Big Cat. Galarraga became a target 
of Montreal fans' frustration when he tailed off after the All-Star game. 
That year he led the league in strikeouts (158), dropping his production 
to .257, 23 HR, and 85 RBI. He fell five RBI short of becoming the first 
Expo to string together three straight seasons with 90 or more runs batted 
in. Despite the rough season, Galarraga blasted his first grand slam, stole 
home for the first time in his career, and was rewarded with a Gold Glove 
Award for his stellar play at first base. Galarraga's 1990 season had Expos 
mumbling that the team should lower its expectations for the slick-fielding 
first baseman. For the second consecutive season, the Big Cat failed to 
repeat the standards he set in his first two full seasons. He hit .256 
with 20 home runs and 87 RBI, almost a mirror image of his previous season. 
For the third consecutive year, he led the league in strikeouts. Pitchers 
exploited his impatience at the plate and didn't give him good pitches 
to hit. Even without any improvement with the bat, Galarraga continued 
to make tremendous contributions on the field, scooping up infielder's 
errant throws, starting 3-6-3 double plays, and winning his second Gold 
Glove. That season he also had a six-RBI game, two four-RBI games, and 
hit his first career inside-the-park homer. Slowed by injuries, Galarraga 
struggled through the worst offensive season of his career in 1991. Disabled 
with a strained left hamstring between May and July, he later had arthroscopic 
surgery to repair damage to undersurface of his left kneecap. Montreal 
missed his glove as much as his bat, committing 43 infield errors in 53 
games without him. That season, Galarraga hit .219, 9 HR, and 33 RBI in 
107 games. He stole home for the second time in his career and hit his 
100th career home run. At the end of the season, he was traded to the Cardinals 
for starting pitcher Ken Hill. Galarraga had a second chance with St. Louis. 
Early in the year however, a pitch broke his wrist and he didn't recover 
until July. He batted .296 after the All-Star break and hit all ten of 
his homers after July 1 for a .497 second-half slugging percentage. He 
finished with a .243 BA and 39 RBI, but made a good impression on Cardinals 
batting coach Don Baylor. When Baylor became the first Rockies manager 
in the off-season, he recommended that Colorado take a chance on Galarraga 
and sign him as a free agent. The Big Cat was given new life for his career. 
In a 1993 season full of remarkable individual achievements, Galarraga 
showed he was an accomplished hitter, and flirted with the .400 mark for 
much of the season. His final .370 BA was a 127-point increase over his 
previous year mark. He led National League batters in batting average, 
and it was the highest average by a right-handed hitter since Joe DiMaggio 
batted .381 in 1939.[1] Despite missing 42 games with assorted injuries, 
The Big Cat compiled 56 multi-hit games to lead the league. He added 22 
homers, 98 RBI, 71 runs, 35 doubles, four triples, a .403 on-base percentage, 
and his .602 slugging percentage was second in the league. His .370 mark 
was the first player on an expansion team as well as the first Venezuelan 
to win a batting title. Tony Gwynn hit .358 to finish as runner-up in the 
title race. Galarraga's improvement began when Baylor drastically opened 
up his stance to make him quicker on inside pitches. The new stance also 
helped Galarraga generate more power to the opposite field. At the same 
time, facing the pitcher with two eyes gave him a better view at pitches, 
lowering his strikeout rate and making him much more consistent at the 
plate with better contact. Galarraga finished 10th in the MVP selection, 
but won The Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award. After the 
season, and for third time, he underwent arthroscopic knee surgery. In 
the strike shortened 1994 season, Galarraga set a new National League record 
in April by driving in 30 runs in a month. He seemed to be on his way to 
a terrific year again, but he fractured his right hand on July 28. At the 
time of his injury, Colorado had climbed to within a half-game of the first 
place Dodgers. Without him however, the Rockies went 3–10 the rest of the 
way. Galarraga paced the club with 31 homers (fifth in the league), and 
batted .319 with 85 RBI. On June 25, 1995, Galarraga hit a home run in 
three consecutive innings to tie an MLB record. He finished the season 
hitting .280, with 31 homers and 106 RBI. His numbers were helped by the 
fact that he stayed healthy for the first time in four years. That season, 
the Rockies had four players with 30 or more home runs, matching the 1977 
Dodgers. On August 29 of the same season, in a game against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, Galarraga spoiled Paul Wagner's bid for a no-hitter by singling 
with two out in the ninth, the only hit Wagner would allow in defeating 
the Rockies 4–0.[2] Over the next few seasons, Galarraga developed into 
one of the best RBI-men in baseball, driving in a combined 396 runs between 
1996 and 1998 (150, 140, 121). In the same period, he batted .279, .303 
and .318, with 31, 47, and 41 HRs. Some critics argued that his achievements 
were possible thanks to the thin-air, mile-high, hitter-friendly Coors 
Field, but Galarraga belted many homers on the road that traveled over 
450 feet (140 m). During the 1997 season, he hit a mammoth home run off 
Kevin Brown; a grand slam that landed 20 rows deep in the upper deck at 
Marlins' Pro Player Stadium and was alternately measured at 573 and 529 
feet (161 m).[1] Previously, he smashed two homers in two games that traveled 
455-foot (139 m) and 451-foot (137 m) respectively, totaling 1,435 feet 
(437 m), an average of 478 feet (146 m) each. The Rockies released him 
at the end of the season to make room at first base for prospect Todd Helton. 
At the time of his release, he was the club's all-time leader in home runs 
(172) and RBI (579). As a free agent, Galarraga signed a three-year contract 
with the Atlanta Braves. During his first season in Atlanta in 1998, Galarraga 
silenced his critics. He proved that he could still have great power production 
at lower altitudes, hitting .305 with 44 home runs and 121 RBI. This made 
Galarraga the first player in Major League history to hit 40 or more homers 
per season, in consecutive years, for two different teams. During 1999 
spring training, Galarraga developed a sore back. Treatment from the team's 
trainers and team doctor included hydrobaths, massages, muscle relaxers, 
and stretching, but would not stop the nagging soreness. He was referred 
to a medical oncologist at Atlanta for a thorough physical exam and an 
MRI. When the diagnosis came in, the famous Galarraga smile disappeared. 
On his second lumbar vertebra in his lower back he had a tumor known as 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of lymphatic cancer. He missed the entire 
1999 season receiving cancer chemotherapy. Rockies third baseman and ex-teammate 
Vinny Castilla switched briefly from his traditional number 9 to number 
14 on his jersey to honor Galarraga's cancer fight. Galarraga returned 
to the field in the spring of the year 2000 in high spirits and good shape 
after undergoing chemotherapy and a strict workout routine. In his third 
at-bat of opening day of the 2000 season, Galarraga knocked in the winning 
run with a home run, and he showed his big smile again. In April and May, 
he was tied for first place in home runs in the National League and he 
was batting .300. At the end of the season, Galarraga had batted .302 with 
28 HRs and 100 RBIs. He was awarded his second National League Comeback 
Player of the Year Award by The Sporting News. Galarraga asked the Braves 
ownership for a two-year contract, but the most that it would offer was 
a one-year contract. Hence, Galarraga decided to become a free agent, and 
he signed with the Texas Rangers for two years. The change of baseball 
leagues affected Galarraga badly. At 40, he found himself "lost" in a different 
league, facing different pitchers, and stuck in a back-up position with 
the star Rafael Palmeiro as the main first baseman for the Rangers. Galarraga 
was used mainly as a designated hitter, as a pinch-hitter, and occasionally 
as a starter against left-handed pitchers. After a disappointing .235 batting 
average, 10 home runs, and 34 RBIs in 72 games, Galarraga was traded to 
the San Francisco Giants at the midseason. In 2002, Galarraga signed with 
the Montreal Expos for the full season. He then returned to the Giants 
in 2003 after he signed a minor league contract before the season. As a 
part-time player with the Giants, he batted .301 with 12 home runs and 
42 RBIs. In 2004, Galarraga's cancer relapsed and he underwent two three-week 
periods of chemotherapy and was hospitalized for 23 days for additional 
treatment. This was the same Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that sidelined him 
in 1999, but he beat it for the second time and began play with the Angels' 
Triple-A affiliate in Salt Lake. When rosters were expanded in September, 
Galarraga came back to the majors. Although he served mostly as a bench 
player in Anaheim, he was highly regarded in the clubhouse, especially 
among younger players such as Vladimir Guerrero, for whom he became a voice 
of experience. Galarraga saw action in a few games, and hit one homer to 
reach 399 for his career total. Again without a team, the New York Mets 
invited Galarraga to spring training, not knowing if the 43-year-old would 
be fit for their roster. Galarraga showed that he had some gas left in 
the tank offensively by socking 3 home runs, but appeared very tentative 
on the defensive end. Galarraga eventually retired during spring training 
on March 29, 2005, saying it was "the right time to give a younger guy 
a chance to play." He finished his career with a .288 batting average, 
399 HR, and 1,425 RBI. Falling just one home run short of 400 career home 
runs, Galarraga ranked #36 all-time at the time of his retirement. Galarraga
