Mark Alan Mulder (born August 5, 1977) is a former American professional 
baseball player of Dutch descent.[1] A left-handed starting pitcher, Mulder 
pitched in Major League Baseball for the Oakland Athletics and St. Louis 
Cardinals. He is a two-time All-Star. Mulder attended Michigan State University, 
where he played college baseball for the Michigan State Spartans.[2] Mulder 
was selected by the Oakland Athletics with the second overall pick in the 
1998 Major League Baseball draft.[3] He was placed on the fast track[clarification 
needed] to the major leagues and made his major-league debut on April 18, 
2000; he was still only 22 years old and had less than two seasons of minor-league 
experience. He had a rocky start to his MLB career, going 9-10 with a 5.44 
ERA. In 2001, Mulder played his first full major-league season and quickly 
became a dominant pitcher. Leading the American League with 21 wins, he 
was in contention for a Cy Young Award, anchoring a powerful Oakland rotation 
along with Barry Zito and Tim Hudson, called the "The Big Three." He continued 
to do well in 2002, winning 19 games and striking out a career-high 159 
batters in 207.1 innings. Limited by injuries in 2003, he would only log 
26 starts, he still won 15 games and had a career-best 3.13 earned run 
average. 2004 was an inconsistent year for Mulder. He started the season 
strong, and was chosen to start that season's All-Star Game. However, he 
had a higher ERA and walked more batters in the second half of the season. 
The A's traded him to the St. Louis Cardinals on December 18, 2004, for 
pitchers Dan Haren and Kiko Calero, and minor league catcher Daric Barton. 
Mulder, Hudson, and Zito were able to carry their team to the postseason 
four seasons in a row, from 2000 to 2003. Mulder competed in the playoffs 
in 2001 and 2002, logging two starts each against the New York Yankees 
(2001) and the Minnesota Twins (2002). He carried over his strong regular-season 
performance by pitching 24 innings in the four playoff starts, with an 
ERA of 2.25 and 19 strikeouts. After the 2004 season, the Athletics traded 
Mulder to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for Dan Haren, Kiko Calero, 
and Daric Barton.[4] In the 2005 season, Mulder's first with the Cardinals, 
he pitched well, 16-8 with a 3.64 ERA. His efforts helped the Cardinals 
reach the NLCS, where they lost to the Houston Astros.[5] Mulder began 
the 2006 season strong, with a 5-1 record and 3.69 ERA through May 17. 
However, his next six starts were mediocre to awful, and his ERA ballooned 
to 6.09. He turned out to be suffering from rotator cuff and shoulder problems, 
and the Cardinals placed him on the disabled list June 23. In August he 
was taken off the disabled list and made several starts in the minors. 
On August 23, he made his first ML start in two months and gave up 9 runs, 
all of which were earned, in 3 innings. After undergoing rotator cuff surgery, 
and with a return for the opening of the 2007 season unlikely, Mulder's 
future with the Cardinals looked somewhat uncertain in the 2007 offseason. 
However, despite being offered comparable deals with the Cleveland Indians 
and the Texas Rangers, Mulder re-signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on 
January 10, to a two-year $13 million contract, with performance-based 
incentives and a club option that could take the deal to three years at 
a possible $45 million. After being re-activated on September 5, 2007, 
he continued to struggle with his command, losing all three of his starts 
with an ERA of 12.27. In that time, he pitched only 11 innings, and gave 
up 22 hits and seven walks. This prompted an MRI scan, which led the team 
to the conclusion that Mulder needed additional clean-up rotator cuff surgery. 
Although he was expected to recover from surgery in time for Spring training, 
Mark started the 2008 season on the disabled list. On June 30, 2008, Mulder 
made his return. He came in from the bullpen with a 7-1 lead over the New 
York Mets in the top of the ninth. Mulder finished the ballgame with no 
runs. On July 9, 2008, Mulder started his first game of the season against 
the Philadelphia Phillies. After striking out Jimmy Rollins to begin the 
game, Mulder threw eight consecutive pitches out of the strike zone, and 
left the game with a shoulder injury while attempting a pickoff throw.[citation 
needed] After the 2008 season, the Cardinals chose not to exercise Mulder's 
$11 million option for the 2009 season, instead buying out his contract 
for $1.5 million.[6] After remaining unsigned, Mulder announced his retirement 
on June 15, 2010, saying "I guess I have retired."[7] While watching the 
2013 MLB postseason, Mulder began to mimic the throwing motion of Paco 
Rodriguez, and felt the hand separation at the top of the delivery felt 
natural.[8] Mulder began auditioning for teams in November 2013.[9] On 
January 1, 2014, Mulder came to terms with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 
on a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training.[9] Mulder 
expressed going into spring training that his shoulder felt strong, but 
wondered about the susceptibility of his lower back and legs to injury. 
On February 15, Mulder tore his achilles tendon. He suffered the injury 
in agility drills on the second day of spring training, before he was scheduled 
to throw his first bullpen session.[8] The Angels released Mulder on March 
11. After first retiring from baseball, Mulder took up golf.[10] He won 
the 2015 American Century Championship, considered to be the "premier" 
celebrity golf tournament. He won the championship again in 2016, successfully 
defending his title. He also served as an analyst on ESPN's Baseball Tonight.[11]
