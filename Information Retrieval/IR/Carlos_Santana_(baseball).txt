Carlos Santana (born April 8, 1986) is a Dominican professional baseball 
designated hitter, first baseman, and left fielder with the Cleveland Indians 
of Major League Baseball (MLB). He was primarily a catcher through the 
2013 season, prior to the emergence of Cleveland catcher Yan Gomes. Santana 
signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2005. He began his pro career with 
the Gulf Coast Dodgers, the rookie level minor league affiliate. He played 
32 games in 2005 and batted .295. In addition to catcher, he played as 
a second baseman, third baseman, and outfielder.[1] On July 26, 2008, he 
was traded with John Meloan to the Indians for Casey Blake. In 2008 with 
the Akron Aeros, Inland Empire 66ers of San Bernardino, and Kinston Indians, 
Santana had 117 RBIs. Entering the 2009 season, Santana was named the top 
prospect in the Indians organization by Baseball America.[2] He was also 
ranked as the organization's top prospect in 2010.[3] He was named the 
Indians' 2009 Minor League Player of the Year (receiving the "Lou Boudreau 
Award").[4] Santana was called up to the Indians on June 11, 2010 to make 
his major league debut, after hitting .316 with 13 home runs and 51 RBIs 
in 57 games for the Triple-A Columbus Clippers.[5] He hit in third spot 
in the batting order, making him the first Tribe player to debut hitting 
third since Jim Norris in 1977, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.[6] 
On June 12, 2010, in his second MLB game, Santana recorded his first Major 
League hit, a two-out, two-RBI double off Washington Nationals pitcher 
J.D. Martin in the second inning. In his next at-bat, Santana hit his first 
Major League home run to right field in the bottom of the fifth inning.[7] 
On August 2, 2010, Santana was injured in a game at Fenway Park while defending 
home plate against Red Sox baserunner Ryan Kalish. While attempting to 
dislodge the ball from Santana's mitt, Kalish slid into his left knee, 
bending it to the side. Santana was unable to leave the field and had to 
be removed on a cart. Test revealed that Santana has a high grade sprain 
of his LCL and a hyperextension of his left knee. The injury ended Santana's 
rookie season. Santana started a triple play against the White Sox on April 
3, 2011 with a diving catch off of an Alexei Ramírez bunt.[8] On April 
29, 2011 Santana hit his first major league grand slam, a walk-off to beat 
the Detroit Tigers, 9–5. Santana finished 2011 with 27 home runs. Carlos 
finished sixth in Major league baseball with 97 walks and changed his batting 
stance.[citation needed] On April 10, 2012, the Indians signed Santana 
to a five-year, $21 million contract with a club option for the 2016 season.[9] 
On May 25 in a game versus the Chicago White Sox, Santana in the eighth 
inning sustained a hit in the mask from a foul tip and did not finish the 
game due to dizziness and was subsequently placed on the seven-day disabled 
list with a concussion.[10] Heading into the All-Star break, Santana was 
hitting .221, including five home runs and 30 RBIs, in 69 games. Manager 
Manny Acta talked of the hopes the Indians had for their catcher but admitted 
he was not hitting "the way we expected him to hit."[11] When Santana hit 
a home run in a July 18 game versus the Tampa Bay Rays, it was his first 
since May 15.[12] He later added on a single and finished the game with 
a season-high four RBIs, his first multi-RBI game since May 11.[13] "I 
know Santana feels so much better to get that monkey off his back. That 
power drought had been weighing on him", Acta remarked after the game.[12] 
Santana matched a career with five RBIs in a September 23 game against 
the Royals.[14] He hit two home runs in the game, his third career multi-home 
run game and first of the season since April 8.[1][15] In 2013, Santana 
and Yan Gomes split the catching duties nearly evenly, with Santana seeing 
significant time at first base and designated hitter when Gomes was catching. 
In 2014, Santana started 2014 playing primarily third base, a position 
he had not played since single-A, with some time at catcher. After a stint 
on the 7-day concussion DL in early June, he played exclusively at first 
base for the remainder of the season and into 2015.[16] Santana recorded 
the final out of the 2016 American League Championship Series by catching 
a Troy Tulowitzki of the Toronto Blue Jays, pop-up in foul territory, sending
