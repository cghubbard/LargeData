William Gustave James Kunkel (July 7, 1936 – May 4, 1985) was an American 
right-handed relief pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1961 to 1963 
who went on to a career as an American League umpire from 1968 until his 
death. His son Jeff was a major league shortstop from 1984 to 1992. Kunkel 
was born in Hoboken, New Jersey. His major league pitching career consisted 
of two seasons with the Kansas City Athletics (1961–1962) and one with 
the New York Yankees (1963). He officiated in the World Series in 1974 
and 1980, and in the American League Championship Series in 1971, 1975, 
1978 and 1982. He also worked the All-Star Game in 1972 and 1977, calling 
balls and strikes for the second contest (Kunkel's experience as the plate 
umpire is documented in the MLB official highlight film of the 1977 All-Star 
Game). He was the first base umpire on September 28, 1974 when Nolan Ryan 
pitched the third of his record seven no-hitters,[1] and was behind the 
plate exactly one year later on September 28, 1975 when four Oakland Athletics 
pitchers – Vida Blue, Glenn Abbott, Paul Lindblad and Rollie Fingers – 
combined to no-hit the California Angels, 5–0.[2] Kunkel, who also worked 
as a referee in the National Basketball Association from 1966 to 1968, 
died of cancer at age 48 in Red Bank, New Jersey. Kunkel's uniform number 
9, assigned when the American League adopted umpire numbers in 1980, was 
retired after his death until the umpiring staffs were unified in 2000, 
when it was assigned to Brian Gorman. Kunkel was the last umpire to use 
the outside chest protector in an American League Championship Series game 
(non-strike situation) when he worked Game 2 of the 1982 ALCS. At the time 
of his death, he was only one of two umpires still using the outside chest 
protector. During his battle with cancer, Kunkel was featured in Safe at 
Home, a 10-minute film released by the American Cancer Society. Regarding 
his recovery, Kunkel stated that "I'm living proof that there's life after 
cancer. ... My problem never enters my mind until someone brings it up."[3] 
There is a park named in his honor in the Leonardo section of Middletown
