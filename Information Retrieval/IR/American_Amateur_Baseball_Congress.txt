The American Amateur Baseball Congress (AABC) is an amateur baseball organization 
in the United States for players from sub-teens through adults.[1] Founded 
in 1935, it coordinates its programs with USA Baseball and the American 
Baseball Coaches Association.[1] AABC has eight (8) age-range divisions 
in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and Canada. There are also five (5) single-age 
divisions: 9's, 11's, 13's, 15's, and 17's.[2][3] In some leagues, however, 
all divisions are age-range and none are single-age. Under the AABC, each 
league has at least four (4) teams, each of which plays at least six (6) 
league games.[1] Each league's winner goes on to state-tournament play. 
The winner of each state tournament goes to regional play and from there 
to the world series.[1] AABC's 75th annual meeting was held on October 
30, 2010, in San Antonio, Texas.[5] 2014 Dallas, Texas 2013 Hamden Yard
