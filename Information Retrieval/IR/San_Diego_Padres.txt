The San Diego Padres are an American professional baseball franchise based 
in San Diego, California. The Padres are a member of the West division 
of the National League (NL) in Major League Baseball (MLB), along with 
the San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Dodgers, Colorado Rockies, and Arizona 
Diamondbacks. Founded in 1969, the Padres have won the NL pennant twice: 
in 1984 and 1998, losing in the World Series both times. As of 2015, they 
have had 14 winning seasons in franchise history.[3] The Padres and the 
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are the only Major League Baseball teams 
in California to originate from California; the Athletics are originally 
from Philadelphia (and moved to the state from Kansas City), and the Dodgers 
and Giants are originally from Brooklyn and New York City respectively. 
The Padres adopted their name from the Pacific Coast League team that arrived 
in San Diego in 1936. That minor league franchise won the PCL title in 
1937, led by 18-year-old Ted Williams, the future Hall-of-Famer who was 
a native of San Diego. The team's name, Spanish for "fathers", refers to 
the Spanish Franciscan friars who founded San Diego in 1769. In 1969, the 
Padres joined the ranks of Major League Baseball as one of four new expansion 
teams, along with the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals), the 
Kansas City Royals, and the Seattle Pilots (now the Milwaukee Brewers). 
Their original owner was C. Arnholt Smith, a prominent San Diego businessman 
and former owner of the PCL Padres whose interests included banking, tuna 
fishing, hotels, real estate and an airline. Despite initial excitement, 
the guidance of longtime baseball executives, Eddie Leishman and Buzzie 
Bavasi as well as a new playing field, the team struggled; the Padres finished 
in last place in each of its first six seasons in the NL West, losing 100 
games or more four times. One of the few bright spots on the team during 
the early years was first baseman and slugger Nate Colbert, an expansion 
draftee from the Houston Astros and still the Padres' career leader in 
home runs. The team's fortunes gradually improved as they won five National 
League West titles and reached the World Series twice, in 1984 and in 1998, 
but lost both times. The Padres' main draw during the 1980s and 1990s was 
Tony Gwynn, who won a number of league batting titles. They moved into 
their current stadium, Petco Park, in 2004. As of 2015, the Padres are 
the only team in the MLB yet to throw a no-hitter since their addition 
to the league in 1969.[4] The team has played its spring training games 
at the Peoria Sports Complex in Peoria, Arizona since 1994. They share 
the stadium with the Seattle Mariners. From 1969 to 1993, the Padres held 
spring training in Yuma, Arizona at Desert Sun Stadium. Due to the short 
driving distance and direct highway route (170 miles, all on Interstate 
8), Yuma was very popular with Padres fans, and many fans would travel 
by car from San Diego for spring training games. The move from Yuma to 
Peoria was very controversial, but was defended by the team as a reflection 
on the low quality of facilities in Yuma and the long travel necessary 
to play against other Arizona-based spring training teams (whose sites 
were all in the Phoenix and Tucson areas, both rather far from Yuma). Throughout 
the team's history, the San Diego Padres have used six different logos 
and four different color combinations. The original team colors were brown 
and gold.[5] Their first logo depicts a friar swinging a bat with Padres 
written at the top while standing in a sun-like figure with San Diego Padres 
on the exterior of it. The "Swinging Friar" has popped up on the uniform 
on and off ever since (he is currently on the left sleeve of the navy alternate 
jersey) although the head of the friar has been tweaked from the original 
in recent years, and it is currently the mascot of the team. In 1985, the 
Padres switched to using a script-like logo in which Padres was written 
sloped up. That would later become a script logo for the Padres. The team's 
colors were changed to brown and orange and remained this way through the 
1990 season. In 1989, the Padres took the scripted Padres logo that was 
used from 1985 to 1988 and put it in a tan ring that read "San Diego Baseball 
Club" with a striped center. In 1991, the logo was changed to a silver 
ring with the Padres script changed from brown to blue. The logo only lasted 
one year, as the Padres changed their logo for the third time in three 
years, again by switching colors of the ring. The logo became a white ring 
with fewer stripes in the center and a darker blue Padres script with orange 
shadows. In 1991, the team's colors were also changed, to a combination 
of orange and navy blue. For the 2001 season, the Padres removed the stripes 
off their jerseys and went with a white home jersey with the Padres name 
on the front in navy blue. The pinstripe jerseys were worn as alternate 
jerseys on certain occasions throughout the 2001 season. The Padres kept 
this color scheme and design for three seasons until their 2004 season, 
in which they moved into their new ballpark. The logo was completely changed 
when the team changed stadiums between the 2003 and 2004 seasons, with 
the new logo looking similar to home plate with San Diego written in sand 
font at the top right corner and the Padres new script written completely 
across the center. Waves finished the bottom of the plate. Navy remained 
but a sandy beige replaced orange as a secondary color. The team's colors 
were also changed, to navy blue and sand brown. The San Diego was removed 
from the top right corner of the logo for the 2011 season, and the away 
uniform changed from sand to gray. For the 2012 season, the Padres unveiled 
a new primary logo, featuring the cap logo inside a navy blue circle with 
the words "San Diego Padres Baseball Club" adorning the outer circle. The 
"swinging friar" logo was recolored to the current colors of navy blue 
and white. Another secondary logo features the Padres script carried over 
from the previous year's logo below the depiction of Petco Park in sand 
and above the year of the team's first season (EST. 1969). The blue and 
sand version will be used in the home uniforms, with the blue and white 
version to be used on the away and alternate uniforms.[6] For the 2016 
season, San Diego will switch to a blue and yellow color scheme, similar 
to the concept of the 2016 MLB All Star Game logo.[1][7] Also for the 2016 
season San Diego added a new brown and yellow alternate uniform to be worn 
mostly during Friday home games. Starting in 1996, the Padres became the 
first national sports team to have an annual military appreciation event.[8] 
Following in 2000, the Padres began wearing a camouflage to honor the military. 
The jersey has since gone through three different versions.[9][10][11] 
Starting in 2008, the Padres began wearing camouflage jerseys for every 
Sunday home game. They also wear these uniforms on Memorial Day, Independence 
Day, and Labor Day. Beginning in 2011, the Padres have changed the camouflage 
design to a more modern "digital" design, using the MARPAT design after 
receiving permission from then-Commandant Conway,[9] and dropped the green 
from the lettering and logo of the jersey. Green has been replaced by a 
sand-olive color (also in the cap worn with the jersey). Since 1995[12] 
Marine Recruits from the nearby Marine Corps Recruit Depot often visit 
the games en masse during Military Appreciation Day, in uniform, often 
filling entire sections in the upper deck of Petco Park. When they are 
present, the team commemorates this with a special Fourth Inning Stretch 
featuring the Marine Hymn.[13] Through April 2005 over 60,000 marine recruits 
were hosted by the Padres.[14] This is part of an extensive military outreach 
program, which also includes a series of Military Appreciation Night games,[15] 
and game tapes mailed to deployed United States Navy ships of the Pacific 
Fleet for onboard viewing (a large portion of the Pacific Fleet is homeported 
in San Diego).[16][17][18] The San Diego area is home to a number of military 
installations, including several Navy and Coast Guard bases centered on 
San Diego Bay, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar (former home of the "Top 
Gun" training program), and the Marine Corps training ground at Camp Pendleton. 
Civilians employed at those bases account for around 5% of the county's 
working population.[19] The "Swinging Friar" is currently the mascot of 
the team. Some in the past have confused The Famous Chicken as the mascot 
of the Padres. Although he does make appearances occasionally at San Diego 
sporting events, he has never been the official mascot of any San Diego 
sports team. The following elected members of the Baseball Hall of Fame 
played and/or managed for the Padres. Roberto Alomar Rollie Fingers Goose

Padre players and one was Jackie Robinson's number 42, which was retired 
by all of Major League Baseball.[23] The retired numbers are displayed 
on the upper deck facade behind home plate. The Padres also have a "star 
on the wall" in honor of broadcaster Jerry Coleman, in reference to his 
trademark phrase "Oh Doctor! You can hang a star on that baby!" Nearby 
the initials of former owner Ray Kroc are also displayed. Both the star 
and the initials are painted in gold on the front of the pressbox down 
the right field line accompanied by the name of the person in white. Kroc 
was honored in 1984, Coleman in 2001. The following 11 people have been 
inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame since it was founded in 
1999.[24] Gwynn, Winfield, Fingers, Gossage, Randy Jones, and Graig Nettles 
(3B, 1984–1987) are members of the San Diego Hall of Champions, which is 
open to athletes native to the San Diego area (such as Nettles) as well 
as to those who played for San Diego teams (such as Gwynn). Pitchers Catchers

Depth Chart → All MLB rosters As of 2014, the Padres' flagship radio station 
is XEPRS-AM 1090 collectively known as The Mighty 1090. Ted Leitner is 
the primary play-by-play announcer, with Jesse Agler working the middle 
innings of each game and Bob Scanlan serving as color analyst. The games 
are also broadcast in Spanish on XEMO-AM, "La Poderosa 860 AM", with Eduardo 
Ortega, Carlos Hernández and Pedro Gutiérrez announcing. Padre games were 
also aired from 2006–2010 XHPRS-FM 105.7. On August 18th, 2016, the Padres 
announced they will air their games on KBZT FM 949 beginning with the 2017 
season [25] Padres' games are currently televised by Fox Sports San Diego. 
Dick Enberg and Don Orsillo share the role of play-by-play announcer, with 
Mark Grant as color analyst and Kris Budden as field reporter. Mike Pomeranz 
hosts the Padres Live pre- and post-game show along with Mark Sweeney. 
Spanish language telecasts of Sunday games are seen XHAS-TDT channel 33. 
Until September 2007, Friday and Saturday Spanish games were seen on KBOP-CA 
channel 43, until that station changed to an all-infomercial format. This 
makes XHAS-TDT the only over-the-air-television station carrying Padres 
baseball. English-language Padres over-the-air broadcasts aired over the 
years on XETV-TV, KCST-TV, KUSI-TV, KFMB-TV and KSWB-TV. John Demott was 
the Padres' first public address announcer when the team began in 1969. 
By the late 1970s Bruce Binkowski had taken over as PA announcer, and became 
the longest-serving public address announcer in the team's history, remaining 
until the end of the 1999 season. First DeMott and then Binkowski also 
were responsible with PA announcing duties for the San Diego Chargers and 
the San Diego State University Aztecs, both of which were joint tenants 
at Qualcomm Stadium with the Padres until the Padres moved into Petco Park. 
From Petco Park's opening in 2004 until 2013, the PA announcer was Frank 
Anthony, a radio host with 105.7 The Walrus. On April 19, 2014, Alex Miniak 
was announced as the new Public Address Announcer for the San Diego Padres. 
Miniak was formerly the PA announcer for the New Hampshire Fisher Cats, 
the Double-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays.[26] The San Diego Padres 
established The Padres Scholars program, the first of its kind among professional 
sports. Originally each Padres scholar was selected as a seventh grader 
and received a $5,000 scholarship after graduation from High School to 
go towards higher education. This program has reached 389 students from 
its establishment in 1995 to now. Over the past few years the program has 
undergone a few changes to be effective an education standpoint. This program 
focuses on creating a close relationship between the chosen scholars and 
the team. As of 2011, 3 high school seniors will be chosen to receive a 
$30,000 scholarship to be awarded through the course of their higher education. 
Maintaining this prestigious award is conditional on maintaining contact 
with the Padres and providing proof of good academic standing.[27] The 
San Diego Padres are the sponsors of and heavily involved in most aspects 
of the Sports Business Management MBA degree program offered in conjunction 
with San Diego State University's College of Business Administration. SDSU's 
Sports MBA is the only program of its kind created in partnership with 
a professional sports franchise. The curriculum focuses on the entire sports 
business industry, not just baseball. The program includes an internship. 
Members of Padres senior management regularly participate, including work 
with the development and continued coordination of SDSU's International 
Case Competition, which annually attracts participation from top business
