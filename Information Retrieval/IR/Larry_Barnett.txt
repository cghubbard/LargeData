Lawrence Robert Barnett (born January 3, 1945) is a former umpire in Major 
League Baseball who worked in the American League from 1969 to 1999 before 
becoming the major leagues' supervisor of umpires from 2000 to 2001. Barnett's 
32 years of AL service surpassed the record held by Tommy Connolly (1901â€“31), 
which was tied by Barnett and Don Denkinger in 1998. Through the 2005 season, 
Joe Brinkman has umpired AL games in 33 seasons, although the major league 
umpiring staffs were merged in 2000. Barnett officiated in 4 World Series: 
1975, 1981, 1984 and 1990 (Games 1-2), serving as crew chief in 1981. He 
also umpired in a record 7 American League Championship Series (1972, 1976, 
1979, 1982, 1986, 1991, 1996), and in 4 All-Star games (1973, 1980, 1988, 
1997), calling balls and strikes for the last contest. He was also the 
home plate umpire for Vida Blue's no-hitter on September 21, 1970.[1] He 
wore uniform number 22 starting in 1980 when the AL adopted uniform numbers. 
In 1999, Barnett ejected Detroit Tigers pitcher Brian Moehler after discovering 
some sandpaper on Moehler's thumb.[2] In the 10th inning of Game 3 of the 
1975 World Series, in which Barnett was working behind home plate, Cincinnati 
Reds hitter Ed Armbrister laid down a sacrifice bunt, and then collided 
with Boston Red Sox catcher Carlton Fisk who was trying to field the ball. 
Fisk committed a throwing error on the play after colliding with Armbrister, 
which led to the Reds' winning run. Barnett declined to make an interference 
call on Armbrister, despite Boston's pleas. Barnett's failure to call an 
interference was criticized by NBC television broadcaster Curt Gowdy (a 
former Red Sox announcer), who was particularly harsh in his comments, 
reputedly leading NBC to drop Gowdy from its baseball coverage.[3] Gowdy 
had been given the correct interpretation by NBC Radio Producer Jay Scott 
(who was a Triple-A fill-in umpire at the time as well), but did not use 
it.[4] Barnett later claimed he had received death threats on account of 
Gowdy's criticism.[5] Major League Baseball continues to this day to maintain 
that Barnett made the correct call. In fact, the Professional Baseball 
Umpires Corporation (the organization that oversees all minor league baseball 
umpires) instructs and teaches its umpires to make the same call as Barnett 
did should the same incident occur in a future game. Specifically, Major 
League Baseball has interpreted Rule 7.09(l) as saying "a catcher trying 
to field a batted ball that remains in the immediate vicinity of the plate 
cannot be protected because of the right of the batter-runner to begin 
his advance to first. Barring an intentional action on the part of either 
player, contact in this instance is incidental, and is not interference..." 
(Jaksa/Roder Umpires' Manual, 1997 Edition. Pg. 57). Prior to Game 2 of 
the 1986 World Series, NBC did a feature on replays narrated by Bob Costas. 
One of the plays cited by Costas was the Armbrister play, and Barnett and 
Costas both insisted that Barnett had made the correct call, although Barnett 
declared, "You won't find many people in Boston who believe it was the 
right call." Costas used the feature to condemn the suggested notion of 
instant replay to settle calls, noting that it was the "same kind of mentality 
that adds color to classic movies and calls it progress." Barnett was also 
behind the plate for Game 1 of the 1996 American League Championship Series, 
better known as the Jeffrey Maier game after the 11-year-old spectator 
who reached over the right field fence to catch Derek Jeter's fly ball. 
The play was ruled a home run by right field umpire Rich Garcia, who later
