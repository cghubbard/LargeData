Fred Toney (December 11, 1888 – March 11, 1953) was an American right-handed 
pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, 
New York Giants and St. Louis Cardinals from 1911–1923. His career record 
was 139 wins, 102 losses, and a 2.69 earned run average. Toney twice won 
20 games in a season (1917, 1920) and also led the National League in saves 
in 1918.[1] Toney is best remembered for his participation in what the 
record books used to refer to as a double no-hitter. On May 2, 1917, at 
the ballpark now known as Wrigley Field, Toney dueled with Hippo Vaughn 
of the Chicago Cubs during nine hitless innings. In the top of the tenth, 
the Reds scored on a couple of hits after Vaughn had retired the first 
batter, while Toney continued to hold the Cubs hitless in the bottom of 
the inning, winning the game for the Reds. With changes to the scoring 
rules in recent years, this game is no longer considered as a no-hitter 
for Vaughn; but it is still the only occasion in Major League history in 
which a regulation nine innings was played without either team logging 
a hit.[2] On July 1, 1917, Toney pitched two complete-game, three-hitters 
for victories in a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates, to set 
a record for fewest hits allowed in a double header by a Major League pitcher.[3] 
Toney also holds the record for the longest no-hitter in organized baseball 
history. On May 10, 1909, while pitching for the Winchester Hustlers of 
the Blue Grass League, he defeated the Lexington Colts in 17 innings, 1–0, 
striking out 19 batters and walking only one, before Winchester finally
