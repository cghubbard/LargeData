George William Hall (March 29, 1849 – June 11, 1923) was a professional 
baseball player who played in the National Association and later the National 
League. Born in Stepney, England, Hall later immigrated to the U.S. He 
made his professional debut on May 5, 1871.[1] Hall began his professional 
career with the Washington Olympics of the National Association in 1871, 
hitting .294 in 32 games. He moved onto the Baltimore Canaries for the 
1872 and 1873 seasons, hitting .336 and .345 respectively.[1] Playing mostly 
center field up to this point, he moved around from center to right field 
the following year when he played for the 1874 Champions, the Boston Red 
Stockings.[1][2] After just one season with the Red Stockings, he moved 
on to play for the Philadelphia Athletics where he had another good season 
at the plate, hitting .299, and four home runs, which was good for second 
place behind Jim O'Rourke's six.[3] After the 1875 season the National 
Association folded, leaving room for a new league to begin. In 1876, the 
National League came into existence, the first official "Major League". 
Hall's team, the Athletics, followed that movement with very little success, 
finishing seventh out of eight teams.[4] One of the bright spots that year 
for the Athletics was the hitting prowess of their star hitter, Hall. He 
led the team in almost all major hitting categories including a .366 batting 
average, 51 runs scored, and a league leading five home runs.[1] On June 
17, 1876, he became the first Major League baseball player to hit two home 
runs in one game.[5] Those five home runs stood as the single season home 
run record until Charley Jones hit nine in 1879. For the 1877 baseball 
season, Philadelphia had been expelled from the league for refusing to 
go on a western road trip, late in the 1876 season, for financial reasons, 
so Hall moved on to play for the Louisville Grays. Again, he had an excellent 
season, hitting .323, scoring 51 runs, and hitting 8 triples. Surprisingly, 
after appearing in the league leaders for home runs the last two seasons, 
he did not hit one in 1877.[1] On October 26, 1877, Louisville club vice 
president Charles Chase confronted Hall and fellow Gray Jim Devlin with 
charges that they threw some road games in August and September. Both admitted 
only to throwing non-league games, one of which was an exhibition game 
in Lowell, Massachusetts, on August 30, and another in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 
on September 3. The admissions also implicated teammates Al Nichols and 
Bill Craver. Hall claimed that he and Devlin helped in losses to the Cincinnati 
Reds on September 6 and to the minor league Indianapolis Blues on September 
24‚ but he argued that since the Reds were about to be suspended and the 
games nullified‚ it amounted to an exhibition game.[5] As a result of the 
scandal, all four players were banned for life from Major League Baseball. 
Hall died in Ridgewood, New York, at the age of 74. He was buried at Evergreen
