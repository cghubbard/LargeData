Nippon Professional Baseball (1950–present) The Chunichi Dragons (中日ドラゴンズ, 
Chūnichi Doragonzu?) are a professional baseball team based in Nagoya, 
the chief city in the Chūbu region region of Japan. The team is in the 
Central League, and although they have had little success in the playoffs, 
they are still known as one of the most respected teams in Nippon Professional 
Baseball. They have won Central League pennant 8 times (most recently in 
2011) and the Japan Series twice in 1954 and 2007. They were also champions 
in the 2007 Asia Series. The Chunichi Dragons were formed in 1936 as the 
Nagoya Club. The franchise was acquired by Chunichi Shimbun in 1946.[1] 
They became the "Dragons" in 1947, but experimented with a number of variations 
on their team name before settling on Chunichi Dragons in 1954. The Dragons' 
most famous player toiled for the team from 1936–1958. Michio Nishizawa 
entered the league as a 15-year-old pitcher. He, developed into a 20-game 
winner by 1939. Nishizawa's most memorable pitching feats occurred in 1942. 
On May 24 of that year, Nishizawa pitched a remarkable twenty-eight complete 
innings, totalling 311 pitches in a 4-4 tie against the Taiyō Whales at 
Korakuen Stadium. Later that year, he tossed his first and only no-hitter, 
accomplishing the feat against the Hankyu team. Despite a career ERA of 
2.22, the heavy workload combined with injuries sustained during two years 
of service in World War II forced him to switch positions to first base, 
and later the outfield. After early struggles with the bat, Nishizawa developed 
into a feared hitter. He swatted a then-league record 46 home runs in 1950. 
His best season came in 1952, when he led the league in both batting average 
and runs batted in. Altogether, Nishizawa appeared in five All Star Games 
and won the Best Nine Award three times. Forkball-specialist Shigeru Sugishita 
dominated the Central League for the Dragons from 1950–1955, winning more 
than 30 games twice (winning at least 23 games each season), and garnering 
three Eiji Sawamura Awards. Led by Sugishita and an aging Nishizawa, the 
Dragons won their first Japan Series championship in 1954, defeating the 
Nishitetsu Lions 4-games-to-3. Nishizawa went on to manage the team from 
1964–1967; he was elected to the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977 
and his number 15 jersey is one of only two retired by the team. In 1974, 
the team won the Central League title for the first time in 20 years, and 
this victory stopped the Yomiuri Giants from winning the league for their 
tenth consecutive year. Another league title came in 1999, and in that 
year, Dragons set a record by winning 11 consecutive games at the opening 
of the season. In the 2004 season they reached the Japan Series, but lost 
to the Seibu Lions, the Pacific League Champions, and in 2006 they lost 
the Japan Series to the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters. At that point the 
team had won the Central League pennant seven times since 1950, but their 
last Japan Series victory was in 1954, the longest such drought in Nippon 
Professional Baseball (NPB). In early 2007, the NPB playoff rules were 
changed: The top team in the league would advance automatically, while 
the second and third teams in the league would play a best-of-three series. 
The winner would face the first-place team in a best-of-five series to 
see who would advance to the Japan Series finals. The Dragons took advantage 
of the new playoff system, and after finishing second in the season standings, 
swept the Hanshin Tigers in a best-of-three series, then, in a huge upset, 
swept the heavily favoured Yomiuri Giants in a best-of-five series to advance 
to the Japan Series against the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters. In an exact 
reversal of the 2006 Japan Series, Hokkaido won game 1 of the series, but 
the Dragons won the next four straight games, including a combined perfect 
game from Daisuke Yamai to star closer Hitoki Iwase in the deciding Game 
5, to become the 2007 Japan Series Champions. Pitchers Catchers Infielders
