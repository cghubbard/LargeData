Luis Vizcaíno Árias (born August 6, 1974) is a Dominican Republic professional 
baseball pitcher for the Diablos Rojos del México. He has played for the 
Oakland Athletics, Milwaukee Brewers, Chicago White Sox, Arizona Diamondbacks, 
New York Yankees, Colorado Rockies, Chicago Cubs, and Cleveland Indians 
in his career. Vizcaíno was signed by the Oakland Athletics as an amateur 
free agent in 1994. After gradually working his way through the Athletics 
minor league system, he made one relief appearance for the A's in 1999, 
12 in 2000, and 36 in 2001, but continued to spend significant time in 
Triple-A. In 2002, he was traded to the Texas Rangers for pitcher Justin 
Duchscherer, and the Rangers in turn traded him to the Milwaukee Brewers 
for Jesús Peña. In his three years with the Brewers, Vizcaíno was a workhorse. 
After an outstanding 2002 (5-3, 2.99 ERA, 76 appearances), he slumped badly 
in 2003 (4-3, 6.39 ERA, 75 appearances) before having a bounce-back 2004 
campaign (4-4, 3.75 ERA, 73 appearances). Milwaukee then sent him to the 
Chicago White Sox along with Scott Podsednik and Travis Hinton for Carlos 
Lee. With the White Sox, Vizcaíno had another solid year, going 6-5 with 
a 3.73 ERA in 65 appearances for the 2005 World Champions (he pitched one 
scoreless inning during the World Series in his only playoff appearance). 
After the season, Chicago traded him to the Arizona Diamondbacks. In 2006, 
Vizcaíno went 4-6 and posted a 3.75 ERA in 70 games for the Diamondbacks. 
On January 9, 2007, Vizcaíno was traded to the New York Yankees with three 
prospects for Randy Johnson.[1] He achieved a rare feat on July 21, 2007, 
when he was credited with both wins in relief in a day-night doubleheader 
for the Yankees, joining about 30 other pitchers.[2] In 2007, he pitched 
in 77 games, which was 4th-most in the AL. On December 21, 2007, he signed 
with the Colorado Rockies. On January 6, 2009, Vizcaíno was traded to the 
Chicago Cubs for Jason Marquis.[3] Vizcaíno was designated for assignment 
and released by the Cubs on April 23, 2009.[4] On May 8, 2009, Vizcaíno 
signed a minor league deal with the Cleveland Indians.[5] He then was signed 
to a major league deal on May 14.[6] He was designated for assignment on 
June 23, and released on June 30 after clearing waivers. Vizcaíno performed 
well in the Dominican Winter League following the 2010 season.[7] On December 
19, 2010, Vizcaíno signed a minor league contract to return with New York 
Yankees with an invitation to spring training.[8] His contract was voided 
on February 9, 2011 because of a tear to his achilles tendon.[9] On June 
29, 2011, he was suspended for 50 games by Major League Baseball for testing 
positive for the banned performance-enhancing drug stanozolol.[10] Despite 
pitching more than 500 career innings in the major leagues, Vizcaino has 
never committed an error. Vizcaino signed a minor league deal with the 
Baltimore Orioles in January 2014. He was released in March. Vizcaino was 
born in Baní, Dominican Republic. Vizcaino's second cousin, José Vizcaíno, 
was a long-time MLB infielder. On October 27, 2008, Vizcaíno was arrested 
for DUI after being pulled over for driving 71 MPH in a 45 MPH zone.[11]
