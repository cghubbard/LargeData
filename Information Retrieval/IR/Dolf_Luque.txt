Adolfo Domingo De Guzmán "Dolf" Luque (August 4, 1890 – July 3, 1957), 
was an early 20th-century Cuban starting pitcher in Major League Baseball. 
A member of several halls of fame, Luque was enshrined in the Cuban Baseball 
Hall of Fame and the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1957, as well as in 
the Mexican Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985. A native of Havana, Luque played 
winter baseball in the Cuban League from 1912 to 1945 and was also a long-time 
manager in the league.[1] Additionally, he managed in Mexico in all or 
parts of eight seasons spanning 1946–1956.[2] Luque debuted with the Boston 
Braves in 1914. In 1918, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds, with whom 
he would play the next 12 seasons. In the notorious 1919 World Series, 
he appeared in two games as a relief pitcher. Luque also played for the 
Brooklyn Robins/Dodgers from 1930 to 1931 and with the New York Giants 
from 1932 to 1935. He was with the Giants in the 1933 World Series, and, 
pitching in relief, won the 5th and final game over the Washington Senators. 
He ended his career with a record of 194–179 and a 3.24 ERA. Luque became 
a starting pitcher in 1920. Primarily pitching with a curveball, he led 
the National League in losses in 1922, then had his best year in 1923, 
leading the league with 27 wins and an ERA of 1.93. Luque also led the 
NL in ERA with a 2.63 in 1925. He was known as an adept mentor in the later 
years of his pitching career, and went on to become the pitching coach 
of the Giants from 1936 to 1938 and 1942 to 45. As a blue-eyed, fair-skinned, 
white Cuban, he was one of several white Cubans to make it in Major League 
Baseball at a time when non-whites were excluded. Between 1911 and 1929 
alone, seventeen Cuban-born Caucasian players played in the Major Leagues. 
Many of them, including Luque, also played Negro League baseball with integrated 
teams from Cuba. Luque played for Cuban Stars in 1912 and the Long Branch 
Cubans in 1913 before signing with organized baseball (Riley, 498). Luque 
was known to have a temper. While with the Brooklyn Dodgers, a heckler 
in the stands hollered "Lucky Luque! Lucky Luque!" repeatedly. Luque went 
over to the dugout and told manager Wilbert Robinson, "I tell you, Robbie, 
if this guy don't shut up, I'm gonna shut him up." "Aw, come on, Dolf", 
said the manager. "He paid his way in--let him boo." Just then the heckler 
spotted the rotund Robinson and yelled, "Hey, fat belly!" Robinson said, 
"OK, Dolf--go ahead and clobber the jerk." Luque obliged his manager's 
request. Luque also served as a coach at the Major League level for seven 
seasons (1936–1937; 1941–1945) with the New York Giants, working under 
managers Bill Terry and Mel Ott. As a coach, Luque was a member of the 
Giants' 1936 and 1937 National League champion teams.[3] In between, Luque 
managed in the Mexican League for the Pericos de Puebla (1946–1947), Azules 
de Veracruz (1948), Tecolotes de Nuevo Laredo (1953–1955) and Leones de 
Yucatán (1956). Besides, he managed the 1951 Habana Cubans of the Florida 
International League sandwiched between two stints with the Águilas de 
Mexicali in 1950 (Sunset League) and 1952 (Southwest International League).[2][4] 
Luque made his professional debut in Cuba for the Habana baseball club 
against a Major League opponent, the Philadelphia Phillies, in an exhibition 
series in the fall of 1911. He left the game after 8 innings with his team 
ahead 6 to 5, but his reliever failed to hold the lead and left Luque with 
a no decision. He then pitched against the New York Giants, going 1–2, 
getting the only win for Habana in six games. He debuted in the Cuban League 
in the winter of 1912, but went 0–4, 0–2, and 2–4 his first three seasons. 
In 1914/15 he moved to Almendares and had his first winning season, going 
7–4. The following season he led the league in wins with a 12–5 record. 
The next winter, 1917, he tied for the league lead in wins and also led 
in hitting with a .355 average.[5] In 1919/20 Luque became a playing manager 
for Almendares and led the team to a championship in his first season at 
the helm, the first of seven championships as a manager. He contributed 
on the pitching mound with a 10–4 record, leading the league in wins. In 
1922/23 he moved to Habana (where Miguel Angel González was manager) and 
again led the league in wins with an 11–9 record. The next season, he took 
over the helm as Habana's manager and went 7–2 as a pitcher. Later in the 
decade, Luque's Major League team, the Cincinnati Reds, did not allow him 
to play winter baseball in Cuba. Luque sometimes evaded the ban by playing 
under assumed names. [6] By the 1930s, Luque had returned to Almendares 
as manager. He generally pitched only occasionally, though in 1934/35 he 
contributed as a pitcher to his second championship as a manager; he tied 
for the league lead in wins with a 6–2 record and led the league with a 
1.27 ERA. As manager, he again led Almendares to championships in 1939/40, 
1941/42, and 1942/43, led Cienfuegos to a championship in 1945/46, and 
returned to Almendares for his final championship in 1946/47. He continued 
to manage for various teams until 1955/56.[7] Luque's career Cuban League 
pitching record was 106–71. Luque is the all-time Cuban League leader in 
years pitching with 22, ranking second behind Martín Dihigo in wins with 
106, and seventh in winning percentage with .599.[8] Luque died in 1957
