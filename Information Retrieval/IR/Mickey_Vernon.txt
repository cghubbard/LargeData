As player As manager James Barton "Mickey" Vernon (April 22, 1918 – September 
24, 2008) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) first baseman who 
played for the Washington Senators (1939–48, 1950–55), Cleveland Indians 
(1949–50, 1958), Boston Red Sox (1956–57), Milwaukee Braves (1959), and 
Pittsburgh Pirates (1960). Vernon served in World War II during two major 
league seasons. He retired from MLB in 1960 with 2,495 hits, and holds 
the major league record for career double plays at first base (2,044). 
He has the American League (AL) record for career games (2,227), putouts 
(19,754), assists (1,444) and total chances (21,408). He batted and threw 
left-handed. Mickey Vernon was born in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, and attended 
Villanova University, before making his major league debut on July 8, 1939. 
He was the father of Gay Vernon. During World War II, he served in the 
United States Navy and served with major league players Larry Doby and 
Billy Goodman on Ulithi in the South Pacific in 1945; both Goodman and 
Vernon personally inspired Doby to become a major league baseball player. 
Vernon played for 14 full major league seasons (400 at bats or more) in 
his 20-year career. He batting over .335 twice, over .300 five times, and 
over .290 nine times. In 1954, He had a career high 20 home runs, 97 RBIs, 
a career high 14 triples. He led the AL three times in doubles with a total 
of 33. He also had 294 total bases, which was 2nd in the AL, behind Minnie 
Miñoso. Over time, Vernon became one of the best-liked ballplayers, mainly 
through his unique personality and charismatic, but quiet, style. By his 
last game on September 27, 1960, before being released by the Pirates he 
was, at 42, the oldest player by almost a year, and one of the most popular 
players in the game. He had spent that season as the Bucs' first-base coach 
before being activated, and earned a world series ring as a member of the 
1960 champions. Vernon is one of only 29 players in baseball history to 
have appeared in a major league game in four decades. Vernon posted a career 
.286 batting average with 172 home runs and 1,311 RBIs in 2,409 games. 
The left-hander averaged 88 RBIs a year, and had 11 seasons with 80 or 
more, 3 with 90 or more. He accumulated 1196 runs with 137 stolen bases 
and a .359 on-base percentage. His career slugging percentage came out 
to .428, with a career high of .518 in 1953. He compiled 2,495 hits, with 
490 doubles and 120 triples, in 8,731 at bats. He had 2,741 career total 
bases, with his career high coming in 1953 (315). Vernon coached for the 
Pirates in 1960 under his longtime friend and manager Danny Murtaugh. During 
that world championship season, Vernon made his final appearance as a player, 
when he was activated on September 1 when the rosters expanded to 40 men. 
He appeared in nine games as a pinch hitter, with one hit in eight at-bats, 
while also serving as the Bucs' first-base coach. The following year, in 
1961, he was given the job of managing the expansion Senators in their 
first year of existence. He did so from 1961 until the beginning of 1963. 
He had a career record of 135–227, a .373 winning percentage. He was a 
major league coach for the Pirates (returning there for a second term in 
1964), St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers, Montreal Expos and New 
York Yankees. He managed at the AAA and AA levels of the minor leagues, 
and served as a batting instructor in the Kansas City Royals and Yankees' 
farm system before retiring from baseball. Vernon died from a stroke at 
age 90, on September 24, 2008. He had resided in Media, Pennsylvania. In 
August 2008, he was named as one of the ten former players who began their 
careers before 1943 to be considered by the Veterans Committee for induction 
into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009. Playing in four different 
decades (1939–60), Vernon ended his career with 2,237 games at first base, 
second to only Jake Beckley (2,377) in major league history. He led the 
American League in fielding percentage four times, and the majors twice. 
He became one of the few first basemen to finish his career with a .990 
fielding percentage, and participated in more double plays than any other.
