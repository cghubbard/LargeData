The New York Yankees' 1992 season was the 90th season for the Yankees and 
their first under manager Buck Showalter. The team looked to improve their 
standings from 1991 when they finished fifth in the American League Eastern 
Division with a 71-91 record. The Yankees did improve their record by five 
games and finished tied for fourth place with the Cleveland Indians at 
76-86, twenty games behind the eventual world champion Toronto Blue Jays. 
The team finished with a losing record for the fourth consecutive year, 
with 86 the fewest losses in that span. This was the last season, to date, 
that the Yankees finished with a losing record. The Yankees played at Yankee 
Stadium. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Infielders
