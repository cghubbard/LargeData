Charles Richard "Dickie" Flowers (1850 â€“ October 6, 1892) was an American 
professional baseball player in the National Association. He was a shortstop 
for the 1871 Troy Haymakers and the 1872 Philadelphia Athletics. Previously, 
he participated in the first professional season as every-day shortstop 
for the Keystone club of Philadelphia in 1869, his second season with that 
team. In 1867 the 17-year-old Flowers was first shortstop and second catcher 
for the Quaker City club of Philadelphia in the nominally amateur National 
Association of Base Ball Players. Quaker City was ambitious but Philadelphia's 
third team by playing strength, behind the Athletics and Keystones. Flowers 
scored 112 runs in 27 games, more than four per game and roughly tied with 
three other players for the team's second-best rate behind first catcher 
Fergy Malone. The next season, he moved to the Keystones and led the team 
in games and runs. When the NABBP permitted openly professional teams for 
the 1869 season, the Keystones were one of twelve teams that contested 
the professional pennant race. Flowers played in every known game and he 
was the third of three players who scored more than three runs per game. 
Continuing as the regular shortstop, he played some pitcher and catcher, 
too. The Keystones remained second best in Philadelphia behind the Athletics; 
they lost all five matches between the two and won only 3 of all 20 professional 
matches. For 1870 they did not return to the professional field, but Flowers 
moved to the Haymakers of Troy, New York, a pro team of average strength, 
where he played all 46 known games.[1] Troy helped establish the first 
professional league in 1871 with Dickie Flowers continuing as the regular 
shortstop and proving to be one of the stronger batters in a powerhouse 
lineup. Although he was only 21 years old, his major league career ended 
after merely three games played for the reigning champion Philadelphia
