Thomas P. "Oyster" Burns (September 6, 1864 – November 11, 1928) was a 
professional baseball player whose career spanned 15 seasons, 11 of which 
were spent with the Major League Baseball (MLB) Wilmington Quicksteps (1884), 
Baltimore Orioles (1884–85, 1887–88), Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1888–95), and 
New York Giants (1895). Burns, who predominately played as an outfielder, 
also played as a shortstop, second baseman, third baseman and as a pitcher. 
Over his career, Burns compiled a career batting average of .300 with 870 
runs scored, 1,392 hits, 224 doubles, 129 triples, 65 home runs, and 834 
runs batted in (RBI) in 1,188 games played. Although the majority of his 
career was spent in the major leagues, Burns also played in minor league 
baseball. He made his MLB debut at the age of 19 and was listed as standing 
5 feet 8 inches (173 cm) and weighing 183 pounds (83 kg).[1] Burns, nicknamed 
"Oyster" because he sold shellfish in the off-season, was described as 
a "loudmouth" and having "an irritating voice and personality".[2] Nevertheless, 
Burns led the Bridegrooms to an American Association championship in 1889 
and a National League pennant in 1890. After retiring from baseball, Burns 
died on November 11, 1928, in Brooklyn, New York. Thomas P. Burns was born 
on September 6, 1864, in Philadelphia.[3] His parents, Patrick and Mary 
Burns, were both Irish immigrants.[1] In 1883, Burns began his professional 
baseball career as a pitcher with Harrisburg of the minor-league Interstate 
Association. On the year, Burns posted an earned run average (ERA) of 2.30 
over 20 games pitched, 15 of which were starts. When he wasn't pitching, 
Burns played second and third base.[4] "He was a disturber and one of the 
worst that ever played ball. His disposition was very bad, and he made 
it unpleasant for any of the boys that crested him. He is what you would 
call a bulldozer. [Bridegrooms manager Bill] McGunnigle may be able to 
handle Burns, but I doubt it." Burns began the 1884 season playing for 
the Wilmington Quicksteps, but left the team after they joined the Union 
Association,[1] and joined the Baltimore Orioles. Burns—the youngest player 
on the Orioles and the seventh youngest player in the American Association[5][6]— 
batted .298. Despite playing in only 35 games on the season, Burns recorded 
a team-leading six home runs over 141 plate appearances.[5] He continued 
his career with the Orioles in 1885, batting .231 with five home runs and 
37 RBI, and pitching to a 7–4 win–loss record. His offensive struggles 
led him to be demoted to the Newark Domestics for the 1886 season,[1] where 
he helped the Domestics win the Eastern League pennant.[1] By 1887, Burns 
had reentered the majors for the Orioles and became the team captain until 
he threw a baseball at an opposing pitcher following a groundout;[7] he 
was later fined $25 ($660 in 2011).[1] On the season, he recorded nine 
home runs—good for third in the American Association. Burns's 19 triples 
were enough to tie him with five others for the league lead, and his 140 
games played were tied for the league lead with teammate Blondie Purcell.[8] 
After playing in 79 games for Baltimore, Burns was transferred to the Brooklyn 
Bridegrooms by Harry Von der Horst, the owner of both clubs.[9] While he 
was playing for the Bridegrooms, the New York Clipper described Burns as 
"the noisiest man that ever played on the Brooklyn team. His voice reminds 
one of a buzz-saw."[2] Burns remained with the Bridegrooms for the 1889 
season. He recorded team highs in on-base percentage, batting average, 
and home runs hit while the Bridegrooms, with an 89–48 record, became American 
Association champions.[10] In the World Series, the Bridegrooms played 
the New York Giants of the National League. Burns hit a three-run home 
run to win the fourth game of the series, giving Brooklyn a 3–1 series 
lead. However, the Giants would take the World Series after winning five 
straight games.[9] In 1890, the Bridegrooms had moved to the National League. 
Burns, now 26, led the league in home runs (13) and RBI (128).[11] He hit 
for the cycle on August 1, 1890—becoming the first Bridegroom to do so.[12] 
The team won the National League pennant, and faced the Louisville Colonels 
in the 1890 World Series. The series ended in a 3–3–1 tie: bad weather 
led to the cancellation of more games.[9] After the 1891 season, Burns's 
1892 RBI total was third in the league, and his hits, doubles, triples, 
and batting average marks were the second highest on the Brooklyn team, 
now named the Grooms. In 1893, between games of a doubleheader, a teammate 
of Burns, Tom Daly, was sleeping in center field when Burns stabbed Daly 
with a penknife. Daly awoke and turned on the knife, leading to a severed 
tendon which kept Daly out for two weeks.[7][13] Burns' 1894 batting average 
(.355) was the highest of his career; his hit and run totals were also 
the second highest in his career. Burns continued to play for the club 
until 1895, when he played for the New York Giants. In his final MLB year, 
Burns batted a combined .258 over 25 games. After the 1895 season, Burns's 
contract was purchased by the minor-league Newark Colts. The Colts would 
win the Atlantic League division with an 82–61 record, two games above 
the Hartford Bluebirds.[14] The next season, Burns served as a player-coach 
for the Bluebirds, where he led the team in doubles and batting average. 
In his final managerial year, Burns coached Portland, Maine of the New 
England League. After retiring from baseball, Burns lived in Brooklyn until 
his death on November 11, 1928.[9] He was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery
