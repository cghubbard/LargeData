The 1964 Chicago Cubs season was the 93rd season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 89th in the National League and the 49th at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished eighth in the National League with a record of 76â€“86, 17 games 
behind the NL and World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals. On February 
13, Ken Hubbs, who had been the Cubs starting second baseman in 1963, was 
killed in a plane crash. He was replaced by Joey Amalfitano, who was acquired 
from the San Francisco Giants a few weeks later. On June 15, the Cubs made 
one of the most infamous deals in baseball history, remembered today simply 
as "Brock for Broglio". There were six players involved in all, but the 
most prominent players involved were pitcher Ernie Broglio, who came to 
the Cubs from the St. Louis Cardinals, and outfielder Lou Brock, who went 
to the Cardinals from the Cubs. While Broglio was a serviceable starter 
for the rest of 1964, he would post ERAs over 6 in each of the next two 
seasons, and was out of baseball altogether by the end of 1967. Brock went 
on to star for the Cardinals for the next fifteen years, and eventually 
be elected to the Hall of Fame. It is to this day often held up as an example 
of a lopsided trade outcome. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: Pos
