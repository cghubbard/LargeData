Vada Edward Pinson, Jr. (August 11, 1938 – October 21, 1995) was an American 
professional baseball player and coach. He played as a center fielder in 
Major League Baseball for 18 years, from 1958 through 1975, most notably 
for the Cincinnati Reds, for whom he played from 1958 to 1968. Pinson, 
who batted and threw left-handed, was primarily a center fielder who combined 
power, speed, and strong defensive ability. Pinson was born in Memphis, 
Tennessee and his family moved to California when he was a child. He was 
a graduate of Oakland's McClymonds High School, attended by Baseball Hall 
of Fame outfielder Frank Robinson (a Pinson teammate in the major leagues 
for nine years), star centerfielder Curt Flood and Basketball Hall of Fame 
center Bill Russell.[1] He appeared in 2,469 games for the Reds, St. Louis 
Cardinals, Cleveland Indians, California Angels, and Kansas City Royals, 
notching 2,757 hits and finishing with a career batting average of .286, 
with 256 home runs and 305 stolen bases.[2] Pinson signed with the Cincinnati 
Reds at age 18. In his second year in the minors, for the Visalia Redlegs 
in Class C, he hit .367 with 209 hits, 20 home runs, 20 triples and 40 
doubles.[3] After just two minor league seasons and still only 19 years 
old, he earned a spot on the Reds' 25-man roster out of spring training, 
making his major league debut on April 15, 1958 against the Philadelphia 
Phillies at home in Crosley Field.[4][5] Batting second and starting in 
centerfield, Pinson had one hit in five at-bats, his first hit a single 
off future Baseball Hall-of-Famer Robin Roberts.[6] Three days later, in 
the Reds' next game, he hit his first home run, a grand slam off Pittsburgh 
Pirates' starter Ron Kline at Forbes Field.[7] With the Reds, Pinson twice 
led the National League in hits (1961, 1963), doubles (1959, 1960), and 
triples (1963, 1967). He batted .343 in 1961, when the Reds won the NL 
pennant, but mustered only a .091 (2 for 22) average in the 1961 World 
Series, which Cincinnati lost to the New York Yankees in five games. Highly 
respected throughout the game, he was later a coach for the Seattle Mariners 
(1977–80; 1982–83), Chicago White Sox (1981), Detroit Tigers (1985–91), 
and Florida Marlins (1993–94) after his playing days ended. He coached 
on the inaugural editions of two expansion teams, the Mariners (1977) and 
the Marlins (1993).[8][9] Pinson retired from baseball after the 1994 season. 
On October 5, 1995, he was admitted to an Oakland hospital after suffering 
a stroke. He died on October 21, 1995.[10] He was interred at Rolling Hills 
Memorial Park, Richmond, California.[11] He was survived by three daughters 
Valerie, Kimberly and Renee, son Vada Pinson III, and four grandchildren.[12]
