Eduardo Figueroa Padilla (born October 14, 1948) is a former Major League 
Baseball player. Listed at 6' 1" (1.86 m), 190 lb. (86 k), Padilla batted 
and threw right handed. He was born in Ciales, Puerto Rico. Padilla holds 
the distinction of being the only pitcher from Puerto Rico to win twenty 
games in a regular major league season. Figueroa originally signed with 
the New York Mets as a seventeen-year-old amateur free agent in 1966. He 
went 12–5 with a 2.05 earned run average with the Winter Haven Mets in 
1967, and seemed well on his way to the majors when was called to take 
a draft physical in Puerto Rico. After three weeks away from his team, 
the Raleigh-Durham Mets, he hurt his arm in his first game back. The Mets 
released him, and Figueroa joined the United States Marine Corps, spending 
the next year in Vietnam.[1] Upon his discharge from the Marine Corps in 
1970, Figueroa signed with the San Francisco Giants. After three seasons 
in their organization, he was traded to the California Angels for Bruce 
Christensen and Don Rose on July 6, 1973. Figueroa made his major league 
debut on April 9, 1974. After Nolan Ryan had already given up three earned 
runs to the Texas Rangers, he was yanked in the second inning with the 
bases loaded and no outs. Skip Lockwood struck out the first batter he 
faces, then gave up a grand slam to Jeff Burroughs. The Angels were already 
behind 10–2 when Figueroa was called into the game in the eighth inning. 
He gave up one hit in two innings.[2] On July 6, Figueroa pitched a brilliant 
complete game in which he only gave up one earned run while striking out 
six and scattering six hits. Unfortunately, he received no run support 
from his team, and his first professional decision turned out to be a 1–0 
loss to the Cleveland Indians.[3] His next start was also a complete game. 
This time, however, he received plenty of run support, and shut out the 
Boston Red Sox, 7–0, at Fenway Park.[4] The 1974 Angels were a last place 
team who barely avoided losing 100 games (94). Figueroa ended up with a 
2–8 record despite a solid 3.67 ERA. After splitting 1974 between starts 
and relief appearances, Figueroa was added to the starting rotation for 
1975. The Angels were again a last place team, yet Figueroa still managed 
to put up respectable numbers, going 16–13 with a 2.91 ERA. Following the 
season, Figueroa was traded along with center fielder Mickey Rivers to 
the New York Yankees in exchange for All-Star outfielder Bobby Bonds. Figueroa 
joined a Yankees pitching staff that included Catfish Hunter and Dock Ellis, 
yet it was Figueroa who turned out to be the staff ace, going 19–10 with 
a 3.02 ERA to finish fourth in American League Cy Young Award balloting 
behind Jim Palmer, Mark Fidrych and former California teammate Frank Tanana 
in 1976. Figueroa's numbers tailed off slightly in 1977, as he went 16–11 
with a 3.57 ERA for the 1977 World Series champions. He was 7–7 with a 
3.91 ERA when he took the mound against the Minnesota Twins on July 19, 
1978. Figueroa pitched a complete game shutout,[5] and went 13–2 for the 
remainder of the season to help lead the charge from fourteen games back 
to overtake the Boston Red Sox in the American League East. Figueroa suffered 
from arm problems in 1979, and was limited to only sixteen starts. On July 
20, 1980, Figueroa was tagged by the Kansas City Royals for five earned 
runs in two innings. His ERA ballooned to 6.98, and he was placed on waivers 
shortly afterwards.[6] The Texas Rangers purchased his contract just before 
the July 31 trade deadline. Things did not go well for Figueroa in Texas, 
as he was 0–7 with a 5.90 ERA for the Rangers in 1980. He re-signed with 
the Rangers for 1981, but was released after six minor league starts in 
which he was 2–1 with a 7.83 ERA. Shortly afterwards, he signed with former 
Yankees skipper Billy Martin and the Oakland Athletics, and posted a far 
more respectable 3.34 ERA with their Pacific Coast League affiliate, the 
Tacoma Tigers. He earned a promotion to the majors, and made his final 
major league start on September 6 against the Baltimore Orioles. He was 
leading 4–2 when an injury forced his early departure in the fifth inning.[7] 
Figueroa made five minor league starts for the A's in 1982, and was 0–3 
with an enormous 18.24 ERA. He was offered a minor league deal by the Milwaukee 
Brewers for 1982, but chose instead to retire. In between, Figueroa pitched 
for the Gold Coast Suns of the Senior Professional Baseball Association 
in 1989. He also played winter ball with the Lobos de Arecibo, Criollos 
de Caguas and Cangrejeros de Santurce clubs of the Puerto Rico Baseball 
League. While pitching for Caguas, he led the league in wins on back-to-back 
seasons, recording 10-3 twice in the 1973-74 and 1974-75 campaigns. Major
