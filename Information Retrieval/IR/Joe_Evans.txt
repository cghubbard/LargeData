Joseph Patton Evans (May 15, 1895 – August 9, 1951) was a professional 
baseball player who played in the Major Leagues from 1915-1925 for the 
Cleveland Indians, Washington Senators, and St. Louis Browns. He played 
several different positions, mostly as a third baseman or outfielder.[1] 
He was born on May 15, 1895 in Meridian, Mississippi. Evans made his major 
league debut with the Indians in 1915, playing 42 games for them. He spent 
most of 1916 with the minor league Portland Beavers, playing just 33 games 
for the Indians. 1917 was Evans' first as a regular, as he served as the 
Indians' primary third baseman. However, he batted just .190, and in 1918, 
he split time at third base with veteran Terry Turner.[1] The following 
offseason, the Indians traded for third baseman Larry Gardner, pushing 
Evans back to the bench.[2] Evans played on Cleveland's 1920 World Series 
championship team, batting .349 in 56 games as a reserve outfielder. He 
appeared in four of the seven games of the Series, picking up 4 hits in 
14 at-bats. Evans remained with the Indians until the end of the 1922 season.[1] 
He was then traded to the Senators for Frank Brower on January 8, 1923.[3] 
Evans' first year in Washington saw him set career highs in several categories, 
including hits (98), runs batted in (38) and runs scored (42). He played 
five different positions for the Senators: first base, third base, and 
all three outfield positions. He appeared in 106 games overall, second-highest 
total of his career. Still, the Senators let him go, and he signed with 
the Browns for the 1924 season.[1] Evans spent two seasons in St. Louis 
as a reserve. In his final major league season, 1925, he batted .314 in 
55 games. He played one more season in the minors in 1927, batting .323 
for the Gulfport Tarpons, before retiring.[1] He died on August 9, 1951
