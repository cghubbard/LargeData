The 1996 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 114th season in Major 
League Baseball, their 39th season in San Francisco since their move from 
New York following the 1957 season, and their 37th at 3Com Park at Candlestick 
Point. The team finished in fourth place in the National League West with 
an 68-94 record, 23 games behind the San Diego Padres. Lou Seal is the 
official mascot of the San Francisco Giants. "Born" on July 25, 1996, Luigi 
Francisco Seal has been a regular part of the Giants baseball home games 
and events around San Francisco, and the United States. The name is a play 
on the name "Lucille." Todd Schwenk, an Oakland Athletics Fan, named the 
mascot in a KNBR Sports Radio phone-in contest. Schwenk named Lou for the 
Seals always hanging out on the wharfs at Fisherman's Wharf. It also refers 
to the San Francisco Seals, the baseball club which was a mainstay of the 
Pacific Coast League from 1903 until 1957. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos
