Joseph Paul "Joe" DiMaggio[a] (November 25, 1914 – March 8, 1999), nicknamed 
"Joltin' Joe" and "The Yankee Clipper", was an American Major League Baseball 
center fielder who played his entire 13-year career for the New York Yankees. 
He is perhaps best known for his 56-game hitting streak (May 15 – July 
16, 1941), a record that still stands.[1] DiMaggio was a three-time MVP 
winner and an All-Star in each of his 13 seasons. During his tenure with 
the Yankees, the club won ten American League pennants and nine World Series 
championships. At the time of his retirement, he ranked fifth in career 
home runs (361) and sixth in career slugging percentage (.579). He was 
inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955, and was voted the sport's 
greatest living player in a poll taken during the baseball centennial year 
of 1969.[2] His brothers Vince (1912–1986) and Dom (1917–2009) also were 
major league center fielders. DiMaggio was born on November 25, 1914 in 
Martinez, California, the eighth of nine children born to Sicilian immigrants 
Giuseppe (1872–1949) and Rosalia (Mercurio) (1878–1951) DiMaggio . He was 
delivered by a midwife identified on his birth certificate as Mrs. J. Pico. 
He was named Paolo after his father Giuseppe's favorite saint, Saint Paul. 
The family moved to nearby San Francisco when Joe was a year old. Giuseppe 
was a fisherman, as were generations of DiMaggios before him. According 
to statements from Joe's brother, Tom, to biographer Maury Allen, Rosalia's 
father wrote to her with the advice that Giuseppe could earn a better living 
in California than in their native Isola delle Femmine, a northwestern 
Sicilian village in the province of Palermo. After being processed on Ellis 
Island, Giuseppe worked his way across America, eventually settling near 
Rosalia's father in Pittsburg, California, on the east side of the San 
Francisco Bay Area. After four years, he earned enough money to send to 
Italy for Rosalia and their daughter, who was born after he had left for 
the United States. Giuseppe hoped that his five sons would become fishermen.[3] 
DiMaggio recalled that he would do anything to get out of cleaning his 
father's boat, as the smell of dead fish nauseated him. Giuseppe called 
him "lazy" and "good-for-nothing." DiMaggio was playing semi-pro ball when 
older brother Vince DiMaggio, playing for the San Francisco Seals of the 
Pacific Coast League (PCL), talked his manager into letting DiMaggio fill 
in at shortstop. Joe DiMaggio made his professional debut on October 1, 
1932. From May 27 to July 25, 1933, he hit safely in 61 consecutive games, 
a PCL-record,[4] and second-longest in all of Minor League Baseball history.[5] 
"Baseball didn't really get into my blood until I knocked off that hitting 
streak," he said. "Getting a daily hit became more important to me than 
eating, drinking or sleeping." In 1934, DiMaggio suffered a career-threatening 
knee injury when he tore ligaments while stepping out of a jitney. Scout 
Bill Essick of the New York Yankees, convinced that the injury would heal, 
pestered his club to give him another look. After DiMaggio passed a physical 
examination in November, the Yankees purchased his contract for $50,000[6] 
and five players. He remained with the Seals for the 1935 season and batted 
.398 with 154 runs batted in (RBIs) and 34 home runs. His team won the 
1935 PCL title, and DiMaggio was named the league's Most Valuable Player. 
DiMaggio made his major league debut on May 3, 1936, batting ahead of Lou 
Gehrig. The Yankees had not been to the World Series since 1932, but they 
won the next four Fall Classics. In total, DiMaggio led the Yankees to 
nine titles in 13 years.[7] In 1939, DiMaggio was nicknamed the "Yankee 
Clipper" by Yankee's stadium announcer Arch McDonald, when he likened DiMaggio's 
speed and range in the outfield to the then-new Pan American airliner.[8] 
DiMaggio was pictured with his son on the cover of the inaugural issue 
of SPORT magazine in September 1946.[9] In 1947, Boston Red Sox owner Tom 
Yawkey and Yankees GM Larry MacPhail verbally agreed to trade DiMaggio 
for Ted Williams, but MacPhail refused to include Yogi Berra.[10] In the 
September 1949 issue of SPORT, Hank Greenberg said that DiMaggio covered 
so much ground in center field that the only way to get a hit against the 
Yankees was "to hit 'em where Joe wasn't." DiMaggio also stole home five 
times in his career. On February 7, 1949, DiMaggio signed a record contract 
worth $100,000 ($996,000 in current dollar terms) ($70,000 plus bonuses), 
and became the first baseball player to break $100,000 in earnings. By 
1950, he was ranked the second-best center fielder by the Sporting News, 
after Larry Doby.[11] After a poor 1951 season, a scouting report by the 
Brooklyn Dodgers that was turned over to the New York Giants and leaked 
to the press, and various injuries, DiMaggio announced his retirement at 
age 37 on December 11, 1951.[12] When remarking on his retirement to the 
Sporting News on December 19, 1951, he said: I feel like I have reached 
the stage where I can no longer produce for my club, my manager, and my 
teammates. I had a poor year, but even if I had hit .350, this would have 
been my last year. I was full of aches and pains and it had become a chore 
for me to play. When baseball is no longer fun, it's no longer a game, 
and so, I've played my last game. Through May 2009, DiMaggio was tied with 
Mark McGwire for third place all-time in home runs over the first two calendar 
years in the major leagues (77), behind Phillies Hall of Famer Chuck Klein 
(83), and Milwaukee Brewers' Ryan Braun (79).[13] Through 2011, he was 
one of seven major leaguers to have had at least four 30-homer, 100-RBI 
seasons in their first five years, along with Chuck Klein, Ted Williams, 
Ralph Kiner, Mark Teixeira, Albert Pujols, and Ryan Braun.[14] DiMaggio 
holds the record for most seasons with more home runs than strikeouts (minimum 
20 home runs), a feat he accomplished seven times, and five times consecutively 
from 1937–1941.[15] DiMaggio would likely have exceeded 500 home runs and 
2,000 RBIs had he not served in the military.[16] DiMaggio might have had 
better power-hitting statistics had his home park not been Yankee Stadium. 
As "The House That Ruth Built", its nearby right field favored the Babe's 
left-handed power. For right-handed hitters, its deep left and center fields 
made home runs almost impossible. Mickey Mantle recalled that he and Whitey 
Ford witnessed many DiMaggio blasts that would have been home runs anywhere 
other than Yankee Stadium (Ruth himself fell victim to that problem, as 
he also hit many long flyouts to center). Bill James calculated that DiMaggio 
lost more home runs due to his home park than any other player in history. 
Left-center field went as far back as 457 ft [139 m], where left-center 
rarely reaches 380 ft [116 m] in today's ballparks. Al Gionfriddo's famous 
catch in the 1947 World Series, which was close to the 415-foot mark [126 m] 
in left-center, would have been a home run in the Yankees' current ballpark. 
DiMaggio hit 148 home runs in 3,360 at-bats at home versus 213 home runs 
in 3,461 at-bats on the road. His slugging percentage at home was .546, 
and on the road, it was .610. Expert statistician Bill Jenkinson made a 
statement on these statistics: For example, Joe DiMaggio was acutely handicapped 
by playing at Yankee Stadium. Every time he batted in his home field during 
his entire career, he did so knowing that it was physically impossible 
for him to hit a home run to the half of the field directly in front of 
him. If you look at a baseball field from foul line to foul line, it has 
a 90-degree radius. From the power alley in left center field (430 in Joe's 
time) to the fence in deep right center field (407 ft), it is 45-degrees. 
And Joe DiMaggio never hit a single home run over the fences at Yankee 
Stadium in that 45-degree graveyard. It was just too far. Joe was plenty 
strong; he routinely hit balls in the 425-foot range. But that just wasn't 
good enough in cavernous Yankee Stadium. Like Ruth, he benefited from a 
few easy homers each season due to the short foul line distances. But he 
lost many more than he gained by constantly hitting long fly outs toward 
center field. Whereas most sluggers perform better on their home fields, 
DiMaggio hit only 41 percent of his career home runs in the Bronx. He hit 
148 homers at Yankee Stadium. If he had hit the same exact pattern of batted 
balls with a typical modern stadium as his home, he would have belted about 
225 homers during his home field career. Joe became eligible for the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1953 but he was not elected until 1955. The Hall of Fame 
rules on the post-retirement induction waiting period had been revised 
in the interim, extending the waiting period from one to five years, but 
DiMaggio and Ted Lyons were exempted from the rule. DiMaggio told Baseball 
Digest in 1963 that the Brooklyn Dodgers had offered him their managerial 
job in 1953, but he turned it down. After being out of baseball since his 
retirement as a player, Joe became the first hitting instructor of the 
newly relocated Oakland Athletics from 1968 to 1970. DiMaggio's most famous 
achievement is his MLB record-breaking 56-game hitting streak in 1941. 
The streak began on May 15, 1941, a couple of weeks before the death of 
Lou Gehrig, when DiMaggio went one-for-four against Chicago White Sox pitcher 
Eddie Smith.[17] Major newspapers began to write about DiMaggio's streak 
early on, but as he approached George Sisler's modern era record of 41 
games, it became a national phenomenon. Initially, DiMaggio showed little 
interest in breaking Sisler's record, saying "I'm not thinking a whole 
lot about it... I'll either break it or I won't."[18] As he approached 
Sisler's record, DiMaggio showed more interest, saying, "At the start I 
didn't think much about it... but naturally I'd like to get the record 
since I am this close."[19] On June 29, 1941, DiMaggio doubled in the first 
game of a doubleheader against the Washington Senators at Griffith Stadium 
to tie Sisler's record, and then singled in the nightcap to extend his 
streak to 42.[20][21] A Yankee Stadium crowd of 52,832 fans watched DiMaggio 
tie the all-time hitting streak record (44 games, Wee Willie Keeler in 
1897) on July 1.[22] The next day against the Boston Red Sox, he homered 
into Yankee Stadium's left field stands to extend his streak to 45, setting 
a new record. DiMaggio recorded 67 hits in 179 at-bats during the first 
45 games of his streak, while Keeler recorded 88 hits in 201 at-bats.[23] 
DiMaggio continued hitting after breaking Keeler's record, reaching 50 
straight games on July 11 against the St. Louis Browns.[24] On July 17 
at Cleveland Stadium, DiMaggio's streak was finally snapped at 56 games, 
thanks in part to two backhand stops by Indians third baseman Ken Keltner.[25] 
DiMaggio batted .408 during the streak, with 15 home runs and 55 RBI.[26] 
The day after the streak ended, DiMaggio started another streak that lasted 
16 games. The distinction of hitting safely in 72 of 73 games is also a 
record.[27][28] The closest anyone has come to equaling DiMaggio since 
1941 is Pete Rose, who hit safely in 44 straight games in 1978.[29][30] 
During the streak, DiMaggio played in seven doubleheaders. The Yankees' 
record during the streak was 41–13–2. Some consider DiMaggio's streak a 
uniquely outstanding and unbreakable record, and a statistical near-impossibility. 
Nobel Prize-winning physicist and sabermetrician Edward Mills Purcell calculated 
that, to have the likelihood of a hitting streak of 50 games occurring 
in the history of baseball up to the late 1980s be greater than 50%, fifty-two 
.350 lifetime hitters would have to have existed instead of the actual 
three (Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, and Shoeless Joe Jackson). His Harvard 
colleague Stephen Jay Gould, citing Purcell's work, called DiMaggio's 56-game 
achievement "the most extraordinary thing that ever happened in American 
sports".[31] Samuel Arbesman and Steven Strogatz of Cornell University 
disagree; they conducted 10,000 computer simulations of Major League Baseball 
from 1871 to 2005, 42% of which produced streaks as long or longer, with 
record streaks ranging from 39 to 109 games and typical record streaks 
between 50 and 64 games.[32] DiMaggio enlisted in the United States Army 
Air Forces on February 17, 1943, rising to the rank of sergeant. He was 
stationed at Santa Ana, California, Hawaii, and Atlantic City, New Jersey, 
as a physical education instructor. He was released on medical discharge 
in September 1945, due to chronic stomach ulcers.[33] Other than now being 
paid $21 a month, DiMaggio's service was as comfortable as a soldier's 
life could be. He spent most of his career playing for baseball teams and 
in exhibition games against fellow Major Leaguers and minor league players, 
and superiors gave him special privileges due to his prewar fame. DiMaggio 
ate so well from an athlete-only diet that he gained 10 pounds, and while 
in Hawaii he and other players mostly tanned on the beach and drank. Embarrassed 
by his lifestyle, DiMaggio demanded combat duty in 1943, but was turned 
down.[16] Giuseppe and Rosalia DiMaggio were among the thousands of German, 
Japanese and Italian immigrants classified as "enemy aliens" by the government 
after Pearl Harbor was bombed by Japan. They carried photo ID booklets 
at all times, and were not allowed to travel outside a five-mile radius 
from their home without a permit. Giuseppe was barred from the San Francisco 
Bay, where he had fished for decades, and his boat was seized. Rosalia 
became an American citizen in 1944, followed by Giuseppe in 1945.[33] In 
January 1937, DiMaggio met actress Dorothy Arnold on the set of Manhattan 
Merry-Go-Round, in which he had a minor role, and she was an extra. They 
married at San Francisco's St. Peter and Paul Church on November 19, 1939, 
as 20,000 well-wishers jammed the streets. Their son, Joseph Paul DiMaggio 
III, was born at Doctors Hospital on October 23, 1941.[34] The couple divorced 
in 1944. According to her autobiography, Marilyn Monroe originally did 
not want to meet DiMaggio, fearing that he was a stereotypical arrogant 
athlete. They eloped at San Francisco City Hall on January 14, 1954. An 
incident between the couple is supposed to have occurred immediately after 
the skirt-blowing scene in The Seven Year Itch that was filmed on September 
14, 1954, in front of Manhattan's Trans-Lux 52nd Street Theater. Then-20th 
Century Fox's East Coast correspondent Bill Kobrin told the Palm Springs 
Desert Sun that it was director Billy Wilder's idea to turn the shoot into 
a media circus. The couple then had a "yelling battle" in the theater lobby.[35] 
A month later, she contracted the services of celebrity attorney Jerry 
Giesler and filed for divorce on grounds of mental cruelty nine months 
after the wedding.[citation needed] After the failure of their marriage, 
DiMaggio had undergone therapy, stopped drinking alcohol and expanded his 
interests beyond baseball: he and Monroe read poetry together in their 
later years.[36] On August 1, 1956, an International News wire photo of 
DiMaggio with Lee Meriwether gave rise to speculation that the couple was 
engaged, but Cramer wrote that it was a rumor started by Walter Winchell. 
Monroe biographer Donald Spoto claimed that DiMaggio was "very close to 
marrying" 1957 Miss America Marian McKnight, who won the crown with a Marilyn 
Monroe act, but McKnight denied it.[37] He was also linked to Liz Renay, 
Cleo Moore, Rita Gam, Marlene Dietrich, and Gloria DeHaven during this 
period, and to Elizabeth Ray and Morgan Fairchild years later, but he never 
publicly confirmed any involvement with any woman. DiMaggio re-entered 
Monroe's life as her marriage to Arthur Miller was ending. On February 
10, 1961, he secured her release from Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic. 
She joined him in Florida where he was a batting coach for the Yankees. 
Their "just friends" claim did not stop remarriage rumors from flying. 
Reporters staked out her Manhattan apartment building. Bob Hope "dedicated" 
Best Song nominee "The Second Time Around" to them at the 33rd Academy 
Awards. According to Maury Allen's biography, DiMaggio was alarmed at how 
Monroe had fallen in with people he felt were detrimental to her well-being. 
Val Monette, owner of a military post-exchange supply company, told Allen 
that DiMaggio left his employ on August 1, 1962, because he had decided 
to ask Monroe to remarry him. She was found dead in her Brentwood, Los 
Angeles, home on August 5 after housekeeper Eunice Murray telephoned Monroe's 
psychiatrist, Dr. Ralph Greenson. DiMaggio's son had spoken to Monroe on 
the phone the night of her death and claimed that she seemed fine.[38] 
Her death was deemed a probable suicide by "Coroner to the Stars" Thomas 
Noguchi, but has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories. Devastated, 
DiMaggio claimed her body and arranged for her funeral at Westwood Village 
Memorial Park Cemetery, barring Hollywood's elite. He had a half-dozen 
red roses delivered three times a week to her crypt for 20 years.[39] He 
refused to talk about her publicly or otherwise exploit their relationship. 
He never married again. When he died in 1999, his last words were "I'll 
finally get to see Marilyn."[40] In the 1970s, DiMaggio became a spokesman 
for Mr. Coffee and would be the face of the electric, drip coffee makers 
for over 20 years. Vincent Marotta, the CEO of North American Systems, 
which manufactured Mr. Coffee at the time, recruited DiMaggio for the advertising 
campaign.[41] DiMaggio's spots proved successful with consumers. In a 2007 
interview with the Columbus Dispatch, Marotta joked that "millions of kids 
grew up thinking Joe DiMaggio was a famous appliance salesman."[41] Despite 
his commercials for Mr. Coffee, Joe DiMaggio rarely drank coffee due to 
ulcers.[41] However, when he did drink coffee, DiMaggio preferred Sanka 
instant coffee, rather than the coffee brewed by Mr. Coffee machines.[41] 
In 1972, DiMaggio became a spokesman for The Bowery Savings Bank. With 
the exception of a five-year hiatus in the 1980s, DiMaggio regularly made 
commercials for the financial institution until 1992.[42] DiMaggio, a heavy 
smoker for much of his adult life, was admitted to Memorial Regional Hospital 
in Hollywood, Florida, on October 12, 1998, for lung cancer surgery and 
remained there for 99 days.[43] He returned to his Hollywood, Florida home 
on January 19, 1999, where he died on March 8. Joe DiMaggio's final words 
were: "I finally get to see Marilyn", referring to his long time partner 
Marilyn Monroe.[44] DiMaggio's funeral was held on March 11, 1999, at Sts. 
Peter and Paul Roman Catholic Church in San Francisco;[45] he was interred 
at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California. DiMaggio's son died the following 
August at age 57.[46] A highway lining the Hudson River in Manhattan, New 
York from the end of the to Lower Mannhattan is named the Joe DiMaggio 
Highway. It runs with for the entire way. At his death, The New York Times 
called DiMaggio's 1941 56-game hitting streak "perhaps the most enduring 
record in sports".[39] In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter 
Harry Stein published an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter", consisting 
of five ethnic baseball teams. Joe DiMaggio was the center fielder on Stein's 
Italian team. On September 17, 1992, the doors were opened at Joe DiMaggio 
Children's Hospital at Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida, 
for which he raised over $4,000,000.[39] On April 13, 1998, DiMaggio was 
given the Sports Legend Award at the 13th annual American Sportscasters 
Association Hall of Fame Awards Dinner in New York City. Dr. Henry Kissinger, 
former Secretary of State and a longtime fan of DiMaggio's, made the presentation 
to the Yankee great. The event was one of DiMaggio's last public appearances 
before taking ill. Yankee Stadium's fifth monument was dedicated to DiMaggio 
on April 25, 1999, and the West Side Highway was officially renamed in 
his honor. The Yankees wore DiMaggio's number 5 on the left sleeves of 
their uniforms for the 1999 season. He is ranked No. 11 on The Sporting 
News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and he was elected by 
fans to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In addition to his 
number 5 being retired by the New York Yankees, DiMaggio's number was also 
retired by the Florida Marlins, who retired it in honor of their first 
team president, Carl Barger, who died five months before the team took 
the field for the first time in 1993. DiMaggio had been his favorite player. 
An auction of DiMaggio's personal items was held by the adopted daughters 
of DiMaggio's son in May 2006. Highlights included the ball hit to break 
Wee Willie Keeler's hitting-streak record ($63,250); his 2,000th career 
hit ball ($29,900); his 1947 Most Valuable Player Award ($281,750); the 
uniform worn in the 1951 World Series ($195,500); his Hall of Fame ring 
($69,000); a photograph Marilyn autographed "I love you Joe" ($80,500); 
her passport ($115,000); and their marriage certificate ($23,000). Lot 
758, DiMaggio's white 1991 Mercedes 420 SEL sedan, which was a gift from 
the New York Yankees commemorating the 50th anniversary of DiMaggio's 1941 
season, sold for $18,000. The event netted a total of $4.1 million. On 
August 8, 2011, the United States Postal Service announced that DiMaggio 
would appear on a stamp for the first time. It was issued as part of the 
"Major League Baseball All-Star Stamp Series" which came out in July 2012.[47] 
DiMaggio's popularity during his career was such that he was referenced 
in film, television, literature, art, and music both during his career
