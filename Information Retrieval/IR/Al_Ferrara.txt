Alfred John "The Bull" Ferrara Jr. (born December 22, 1939 in Brooklyn, 
New York was a Major League Baseball player from 1963 to 1971. Alfred Ferrara 
Jr. was born on December 22, 1939, in Brooklyn, New York to Al Ferrara 
Sr. and his wife Adele. Al Sr. was a New York City fireman for 20 years 
who later was an air conditioning technician for Chase Bank before working 
the gate at Jackie Gleason’s Inverrary Country Club in Florida in his retirement. 
Adele Ferrara, a homemaker, died when Al Jr. was 17, leaving her mother, 
Assunta Paulucci, in charge of Al and his twin siblings Frank and Theodora, 
who were 12 at the time.[1] As a youth he was also an accomplished piano 
player. “I never wanted to play the piano, I wanted to play baseball,” 
Ferrara said. “But a first-generation Italian woman like my grandmother 
didn’t know anything about baseball, so I had to play the piano, starting 
at age eight. I learned the classics. Mr. Morvillo insisted that I read 
music and play the pieces as they were written by Beethoven and Bach. I 
got pretty good and I learned to use piano to do what I wanted to do. I 
had a deal with my grandmother that after playing for an hour she would 
give me a quarter to go to the Bat Away at Coney Island. In those days 
you could hit about 25 balls for a quarter. After a while I got a reputation 
as a pretty good hitter and men would come around when I was hitting and 
put more quarters in the machine so I could hit for maybe a half-hour. 
Finally, I got my grandmother to agree that if I were to become Mr. Morvillo’s 
number one student I could give up piano and play baseball. He would have 
showcase recitals at Carnegie Hall, and the number one student would play 
last. When I was 16, I went on last as the number one student, kissed my 
grandmother, and never touched the piano again.”[1] Ferrara attended Lafayette 
High School (New York City) where he was a high school classmate of Bob 
Aspromonte and played sandlot baseball with Joe Torre and Joe Pepitone. 
The summer of 1957 was a turning point for Ferrara. He did well enough 
for the amateur traveling team Dodger Rookies that Dodgers' scout Buck 
Lai, who was also the athletic director at Long Island University, arranged 
for Ferrara to get a baseball scholarship to LIU. After a successful season 
there, he signed a $9,000 bonus contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 
1958.[1] He made his major league debut at age 23 on July 23, 1963 in a 
5-1 Dodgers' loss to the New York Mets at Dodger Stadium. His first hit 
was in his third game, off Dick Ellsworth. His first homer the next day, 
off Bob Buhl, was one of three hit by the Dodgers in the fifth inning of 
a 5-4 loss to the Cubs. He did not play in the 1963 World Series. He came 
up again in 1965 for 41 games but again saw no action in the 1965 World 
Series. In 1966, he had one of his best seasons. He played in 63 games 
with 129 plate appearances, hitting .270, and playing in the 1966 World 
Series, in which he had one hit in one at bat. In 1967 he had his most 
productive season to-date. In 384 plate appearances, he hit 16 home runs 
(a career high) with 50 runs batted in and a .277 average.[2] He was voted 
Dodger of the Year. “I was young, fun and wacky, and I had L.A. in my hands,” 
he said. Ferrara appeared on episodes of Gilligan’s Island and Batman through 
connections with fans in show business and through former teammate Lee 
Walls, who had become a talent agent. “That all came from being a player. 
I wasn’t willing to put in the effort to pursue a real acting career.”[1] 
He played in only two games in 1968. In the Dodgers' second game of the 
season, he was chasing down a line drive to the outfield by the Mets' Tommie 
Agee when he caught a spike in a sprinkler and broke his ankle, ending 
his season and his Dodgers' career.[1] He was picked by the San Diego Padres 
in the 1969 expansion draft, becoming one of the original Padres in 1969. 
In 1969, he hit .260 with 14 home runs and 56 RBIs, and followed that up 
with another good season in 1970, hitting .277 with 13 home runs and 51 
RBIs. In 1971, after playing 17 games with the Padres, he was traded to 
the Cincinnati Reds, appearing in 32 games almost exclusively as a pinch-hitter. 
His final major league game was on September 1, 1971.[2] In 1974 Ferrara 
appeared as a contestant on Match Game '74, listing his profession as a 
"freelance piano dealer." Ferrara played to a zero-zero tie against defending 
champion Marlena Cruz; Cruz won the game 1–0 in a tiebreaker match. After 
leaving baseball, he spent four years as a greeter at the Martoni Marquis 
on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles before going into sales for various home-improvement 
companies, eventually starting his own company, Major League Construction. 
That work lasted 30 years; Ferrara sold his business and retired in 2005 
at age 65. Then, the recession of 2008 occurred and Ferrara lost about 
a quarter of his retirement savings. “Going back into sales or getting 
a job would have been rough at my age, so I decided to go back home . . 
. and called the Dodgers.” The Dodgers put Ferrara to work in their community 
relations department in July 2009. He visits elementary schools and reads 
Dr. Seuss books to the kids; he cautions teens about the evils of alcohol, 
tobacco and drugs; and he entertains guests at some Dodger home games. 
He lives with his companion of over 35 years, Kay Donno.[1] Ferrara was 
previously married twice, once at age 20 and again at age 30. He has a 
son, Al Ferrara III of West Islip, New York, a daughter-in-law Maureen,
