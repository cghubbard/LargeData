Asheville is a city in and the county seat of Buncombe County, North Carolina, 
United States.[5] It is the largest city in Western North Carolina, and 
the 11th largest city in North Carolina. The city's population was 83,393 
according to the 2010 United States census.[6] It is the principal city 
in the four-county Asheville metropolitan area, with a population of 424,858 
in 2010.[7] Asheville is home to the United States National Climatic Data 
Center (NCDC), the world's largest active archive of weather data. Before 
the arrival of the Europeans, the land where Asheville now exists lay within 
the boundaries of the Cherokee Nation.[8] In 1540, Spanish explorer Hernando 
de Soto came to the area, bringing the first European visitors[9] along 
with European diseases, which seriously depleted the native population.[10] 
The area was used as an open hunting ground until the middle of the 19th 
century.[11] The history of Asheville, as a town, began in 1784. In that 
year, Colonel Samuel Davidson and his family settled in the Swannanoa Valley, 
redeeming a soldier's land grant from the state of North Carolina. Soon 
after building a log cabin at the bank of Christian Creek, Davidson was 
lured into the woods by a band of Cherokee hunters and killed. Davidson's 
wife, child and female slave fled on foot overnight to Davidson's Fort 
(named after Davidson's father General John Davidson) 16 miles away. In 
response to the killing, Davidson's twin brother Major William Davidson 
and brother-in-law Colonel Daniel Smith formed an expedition to retrieve 
Samuel Davidson's body and avenge his murder. Months after the expedition, 
Major Davidson and other members of his extended family returned to the 
area and settled at the mouth of Bee Tree Creek. The United States Census 
of 1790 counted 1,000 residents of the area, excluding the Cherokee Native 
Americans. Buncombe County was officially formed in 1792. The county seat, 
named "Morristown" in 1793, was established on a plateau where two old 
Indian trails crossed. In 1797, Morristown was incorporated and renamed 
"Asheville" after North Carolina Governor Samuel Ashe.[12][13] Asheville, 
with a population of approximately 2,500 by 1861, remained relatively untouched 
by the Civil War, but contributed a number of companies to the Confederate 
States Army, and a substantially smaller number of soldiers to the Union.[citation 
needed] For a time, an Enfield rifle manufacturing facility was located 
in the town. The war came to Asheville as an afterthought, when the "Battle 
of Asheville" was fought in early April 1865 at the present-day site of 
the University of North Carolina at Asheville, with Union forces withdrawing 
to Tennessee after encountering resistance from a small group of Confederate 
senior and junior reserves and recuperating Confederate soldiers in prepared 
trench lines across the Buncombe Turnpike; orders had been given to the 
Union force to take Asheville only if this could be accomplished without 
significant losses.[citation needed] An engagement was also fought later 
that month at Swannanoa Gap as part of the larger Stoneman's Raid, with 
Union forces retreating in the face of resistance from Brig. Gen. Martin, 
commander of Confederate troops in western North Carolina, but returning 
to the area via Howard's Gap and Henderson County.[citation needed] In 
late April 1865 troops under the overall command of Union Gen. Stoneman 
captured Asheville. Hartley, Stoneman's Raid, p. 362 (Blair, 2010) After 
a negotiated departure, the troops nevertheless subsequently returned and 
plundered and burned a number of Confederate supporters' homes in Asheville.[14] 
The years following the war were a time of economic and social hardship 
in Buncombe County, as throughout most of the defeated South.[citation 
needed] On October 2, 1880, the Western North Carolina Railroad completed 
its line from Salisbury to Asheville, the first rail line to reach the 
city. Almost immediately it was sold and resold to the Richmond and Danville 
Railroad Company, becoming part of the Southern Railway in 1894.[15] With 
the completion of the first railway, Asheville experienced a slow but steady 
growth as industrial plants increased in number and size, and new residents 
built homes. Textile mills were established and plants were set up for 
the manufacture of wood and mica products, foodstuffs, and other commodities.[16] 
The 21-mile distance between Hendersonville and Asheville of the former 
Asheville and Spartanburg Railroad was completed in 1886.[17] By that point, 
the line was operated as part of the Richmond and Danville Railroad until 
1894 and controlled by the Southern Railway afterward.[18] (Asheville's 
final passenger train, a coach-only remnant of the Southern Railway's Carolina 
Special, last ran on December 5, 1968.) Asheville had the first electric 
street railway lines in the state of North Carolina, the first of which 
opened in 1889. These would be replaced by buses in 1934.[19] Asheville 
prospered in the decades of the 1910s and 1920s and at one point was the 
third largest city in the state, behind Charlotte and Wilmington. The Great 
Depression, the period of Asheville's history made world-famous by the 
novel Look Homeward, Angel, hit Asheville quite hard. On November 20, 1930, 
eight local banks failed.[20] Only Wachovia remained open with infusions 
of cash from Winston-Salem.[citation needed] Because of the explosive growth 
of the previous decades, the per capita debt owed by the city (through 
municipal bonds) was the highest in the nation.[21] By 1929, both the city 
and Buncombe County had incurred over $56 million in bonded debt to pay 
for a wide range of municipal and infrastructure improvements, including 
City Hall, the water system, Beaucatcher Tunnel, and Asheville High School. 
Rather than default, the city paid those debts over a period of fifty years.[22] 
From the start of the depression through the 1980s, economic growth in 
Asheville was slow. During this time of financial stagnation, most of the 
buildings in the downtown district remained unaltered. Therefore, Asheville 
has one of the most impressive, comprehensive collections of Art Deco architecture 
in the United States.[23][not in citation given][24] On July 15–16, 1916, 
the Asheville area was subject to severe flooding from the remnants of 
a tropical storm which caused more than $3 million in damage. In September 
2004, remnants of Hurricanes Frances and Ivan caused major flooding in 
Asheville, particularly at Biltmore Village.[25][26] In 2003, Centennial 
Olympic Park bomber Eric Robert Rudolph was transported to Asheville from 
Murphy, North Carolina, for arraignment in federal court.[27][28] Asheville 
pops up on national rankings for a variety of things: "a New Age Mecca" 
(CBS News' Eye On America, 1996),[29] the "New Freak Capital of the U.S." 
(Rolling Stone, 2000), one of "The 50 Most Alive Places To Be" (Modern 
Maturity, 2000),[30] the "Happiest City for Women" (Self, 2002),[31] one 
of the "Best Places to Reinvent Your Life" (AARP Magazine, 2003),[32] one 
of the "Best Outside Towns" (Outside Magazine, 2006),[33] one of the "Top 
Seven Places to Live in the U.S." (Frommer's, 2007),[34] one of the "10 
Most Beautiful Places in America" (Good Morning America, 2011),[35] one 
of the "25 Best Places for Business and Careers" (Forbes, 2012), and one 
of "20 Great Cities For Writers" (Flavorwire, 2013).[36] Asheville has 
been listed as one of the "Top 25 Small Cities for Art" in AmericanStyle 
magazine's annual list from 2000 to 2012[37] and has reigned the champion 
"Beer City USA" each year from 2009 to 2012. Dozens of micro breweries 
dot the downtown and major producers, including New Belgium Brewing Company 
(opening 2015) are in the process of building in or near the city. In his 
2008 book, The Geography of Bliss, author Eric Weiner cited Asheville as 
one of the happiest places in the United States. Recent national accolades:[38]

The scenic Blue Ridge Parkway runs through the area and near the Biltmore 
Estate. Asheville is located in the Blue Ridge Mountains at the confluence 
of the Swannanoa River and the French Broad River. According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 45.3 square miles (117.2 km2), 
of which 44.9 square miles (116.4 km2) is land and 0.31 square miles (0.8 km2), 
or 0.66%, is water.[6] The climate of Asheville is a Continental Climate, 
resembling the rest of the Piedmont region of the southeastern U.S., but 
with noticeably cooler temperatures due to the higher altitude; it is part 
of USDA Hardiness zone 7a.[39] The area's summers in particular, though 
warm, are not as hot as summers in cities farther east in the state, as 
the July daily average temperature is 73.8 °F (23.2 °C) and there is an 
average of only 9.4 days with 90 °F (32 °C)+ highs annually;[a] the last 
time a calendar year has passed without 90 °F readings is 2009. Moreover, 
warm nights where the low remains at or above 70 °F (21 °C) are much more 
uncommon than 90 °F temperatures. Winters are cool, with a January daily 
average of 37.1 °F (2.8 °C) and highs remaining at or below freezing on 
5.5 days.[40] Official record temperatures range from −16 °F (−27 °C) on 
January 21, 1985 to 100 °F (38 °C) on August 21, 1983;[41][42] the record 
cold daily maximum is 4 °F (−16 °C) on February 4, 1895, while, conversely, 
the record warm daily minimum is 77 °F (25 °C) on July 17, 1887.[40] Readings 
as low as 0 °F (−18 °C) or as high as 95 °F (35 °C) rarely occur, the last 
occurrences being January 7, 2014 and July 1, 2012, respectively.[40] The 
average window for freezing temperatures is October 17 to April 18, allowing 
a growing season of 181 days.[40] Precipitation is relatively well spread 
(though the summer months are slightly wetter), and averages 45.6 inches 
(1,160 mm) annually, but has historically ranged from 22.79 in (579 mm) 
in 1925 to 75.22 in (1,911 mm) in 2013.[40][b] Snowfall is sporadic, averaging 
9.9 inches (25.1 cm) per winter, but actual seasonal accumulation varies 
considerably from one winter to the next; accumulation has ranged from 
trace amounts in 2011–12 to 48.2 inches (122.4 cm) in 1968–69.[40] Freezing 
rain often occurs, accompanied by more significant disruption. Notable 
architecture in Asheville includes its Art Deco city hall, and other unique 
buildings in the downtown area, such as the Battery Park Hotel, the original 
of which was 475-feet long with numerous dormers and chimneys; the Neo-Gothic 
Jackson Building, the first skyscraper on Pack Square; Grove Arcade, one 
of America's first indoor shopping malls;[46] and the Basilica of St. Lawrence. 
The S&W Cafeteria Building is also a fine example of Art Deco architecture 
in Asheville.[47] The Grove Park Inn is an important example of architecture 
and design of the Arts and Crafts movement. Asheville's recovery from the 
Depression was slow and arduous. Because of the financial stagnation, there 
was little new construction and much of the downtown district remained 
unaltered. This however has allowed Asheville to be a great collection 
of Art Deco and truly a style all its own. The Montford Area Historic District 
and other central areas are considered historic districts and include Victorian 
houses. On the other hand, Biltmore Village, located at the entrance to 
the famous estate, showcases unique architectural features that are found 
only in the Asheville area. It was here that workers stayed during the 
construction of George Vanderbilt's estate.[citation needed] Today, however, 
as with many of Asheville's historical districts, it has been transformed 
into a district home to quaint, trendy shops and interesting boutiques. 
The YMI Cultural Center, founded in 1892 by George Vanderbilt in the heart 
of downtown, is one of the nation's oldest African-American cultural centers.[48][49] 
Asheville is the larger principal city of the Asheville-Brevard CSA, a 
Combined Statistical Area that includes the Asheville metropolitan area 
(Buncombe, Haywood, Henderson, and Madison counties) and the Brevard micropolitan 
area (Transylvania County),[51][52][53] which had a combined population 
of 398,505 at the 2000 census.[3] At the 2000 census,[3] there were 68,889 
people, 30,690 households and 16,726 families residing in the city. The 
population density was 1,683.4 per square mile (650.0/km²). There were 
33,567 housing units at an average density of 820.3 per square mile (316.7/km²). 
The racial composition of the city was: 77.95% White, 17.61% Black or African 
American, 3.76% Hispanic or Latino American, 0.92% Asian American, 0.35% 
Native American, 0.06% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 1.53% 
some other race, and 1.58% two or more races. There were 30,690 households 
of which 22.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.1% 
were married couples living together, 13.0% had a female householder with 
no husband present, and 45.5% were non-families. 36.8% of all households 
were made up of individuals and 13.8% had someone living alone who was 
65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.14 and the average 
family size was 2.81. Age distribution was 19.6% under the age of 18, 10.3% 
from 18 to 24, 28.7% from 25 to 44, 23.1% from 45 to 64, and 18.3% who 
were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 
females, there were 87.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, 
there were 84.9 males. The median household income was $32,772, and the 
median family income was $44,029. Males had a median income of $30,463 
versus $23,488 for females. The per capita income for the city was $20,024. 
About 13% of families and 19% of the population were below the poverty 
line, including 24.9% of those under age 18 and 10.1% of those age 65 or 
over. Asheville is the headquarters of the Episcopal Diocese of Western 
North Carolina, which is seated at the Cathedral of All Souls. Asheville 
is also an important city for North Carolinian Catholics, who make pilgrimages 
to the Basilica of St. Lawrence.[citation needed] Asheville is the largest 
city located within the Asheville MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area). 
The MSA includes Buncombe County; Haywood County; Henderson County; and 
Madison County; with a combined population – as of the 2014 Census Bureau 
population estimate – of 442,316.[7] Apart from Asheville, the MSA includes 
Hendersonville and Waynesville, along with a number of smaller incorporated 
towns: Biltmore Forest, Black Mountain, Canton, Clyde, Flat Rock, Fletcher, 
Hot Springs, Laurel Park, Maggie Valley, Mars Hill, Marshall, Mills River, 
Montreat, Weaverville and Woodfin. Several sizable unincorporated rural 
and suburban communities are also located nearby: Arden, Barnardsville 
(incorporated until 1970), Bent Creek, Candler, Enka, Fairview, Jupiter 
(incorporated until 1970), Leicester, Oteen, Skyland, and Swannanoa. According 
to the city's 2009 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[54] the largest 
employers in the city are: The City of Asheville operates under a council-manager 
form of government, via its charter. The city council appoints a city manager, 
a city attorney, and a city clerk.[55] In the absence or disability of 
the mayor, the vice-mayor performs the mayoral duties. The vice-mayor is 
appointed by the members of City Council. City Council determines the needs 
to be addressed and the degree of service to be provided by the administrative 
branch of city government. In 2005 Mayor Charles Worley signed the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement and in 2006 the City 
Council created the Sustainable Advisory Committee on Energy and the Environment. 
In 2007 the Council became the first city on the East Coast to commit to 
building all municipal buildings to LEED Gold Standards and to achieve 
80 percent energy reduction of 2001 standards by 2040. Also in 2007 the 
Council signed an agreement with Warren Wilson College stating the intent 
of the city and college to work together toward climate partnership goals. 
In 2009, a group of Asheville citizens challenged the legitimacy of Cecil 
Bothwell's election to the City Council,[56] citing the North Carolina 
Constitution, which does not permit atheists to hold public office.[57] 
Bothwell has described himself as a "post theist" rather than an atheist[58] 
and is a member of a local Unitarian Universalist congregation. The opponents 
to his election never filed suit. In response to the charge, legal scholars 
explained that the U.S. Supreme Court held in Torcaso v. Watkins that religious 
tests for political office are unconstitutional.[59] Mr. Bothwell served 
his four-year Council term and was re-elected in 2013.[60] While the city 
council elections are non-partisan, party politics may enter into play 
with both Republican and Democratic counterparts backing their registered 
members candidacy. An effort by the council to return to partisan elections 
was defeated by voters in a referendum held in November 2007. In the North 
Carolina Senate, Terry Van Duyn (D-Asheville) and Tom Apodaca (R-Hendersonville) 
both represent parts of Buncombe County. Van Duyn represents most of the 
city of Asheville. Apodaca represents a small portion of the southern part 
of Asheville.[62] In the North Carolina House of Representatives, Susan 
Fisher (D-Asheville), John Ager (D-Asheville), and Brian Turner (D-Asheville) 
all represent parts of the county.[63] All three of them represent parts 
of the city, although the majority of it is in Fisher's district. In the 
2012 presidential election, Barack Obama won the entirety of Buncombe County 
with 55% of the vote. Obama has visited the city on a few occasions.[64] 
In April 2010, he and his family vacationed in the city; it was the first 
time he visited since October 5, 2008.[65] North Carolina is represented 
in the United States Senate by Richard Burr (R-Winston-Salem) and Thom 
Tillis (R-Greensboro). The city of Asheville is based in both North Carolina's 
10th congressional district and North Carolina's 11th congressional district, 
represented by Patrick McHenry (R-Gaston County) and Mark Meadows (R-Jackson 
County), respectively. Public Asheville City Schools include Asheville 
High School (known as Lee H Edwards High School 1935–1969), School of Inquiry 
and Life Sciences at Asheville, Asheville Middle School, Claxton Elementary, 
Randolph Learning Center, Hall Fletcher Elementary, Isaac Dickson Elementary, 
Ira B. Jones Elementary and Vance Elementary. Asheville High has been ranked 
by Newsweek magazine as one of the top 100 high schools in the United States. 
The Buncombe County School System operates high schools, middle schools 
and elementary schools both inside and outside the city of Asheville. Clyde 
A. Erwin High School, T C Roberson High School and A. C. Reynolds High 
School are three Buncombe County schools located in Asheville.[citation 
needed] Asheville was formerly home to one of the only Sudbury schools 
in the Southeast, Katuah Sudbury School. It is also home to several charter 
schools, including Francine Delany New School for Children (one of the 
first charter schools in North Carolina) and Evergreen Community Charter 
School, an Outward Bound-Expeditionary Learning School, recognized as one 
of the most environmentally conscious schools in the country.[66] Two private 
residential high schools are located in the Asheville area: the all-male 
Christ School (located in Arden) and the co-educational Asheville School. 
Other private schools include Carolina Day School, Veritas Christian Academy 
and Asheville Christian Academy. Asheville and its surrounding area have 
several institutions of higher education: Asheville is served by Asheville 
Regional Airport in nearby Fletcher, North Carolina, and by Interstate 
40, Interstate 240, and Interstate 26. A milestone was achieved in 2003 
when Interstate 26 was extended from Mars Hill (north of Asheville) to 
Johnson City, Tennessee, completing a 20-year half-billion dollar construction 
project through the Blue Ridge Mountains. Work continues to improve Interstate 
26 from Mars Hill to Interstate 40 by improving U.S. Route 19 and U.S. 
Route 23 and the western part of Interstate 240. This construction will 
include a multimillion-dollar bridge to cross the French Broad River.[67] 
The city operates Asheville Redefines Transit, which consists of sixteen 
bus lines[68] providing service throughout the City of Asheville and to 
Black Mountain, North Carolina. The Norfolk Southern Railway passes through 
the city, though passenger service is currently not available in the area. 
The residents of Asheville are served by the Buncombe County Public Libraries, 
consisting of 11 branches located throughout the County with the headquarters 
and central library, Pack Memorial Library, being located downtown.[69] 
The system also includes a law library in the Buncombe County Courthouse 
and a genealogy and local history department located in the central library. 
Drinking water in Asheville is provided by the Asheville water department. 
The water system consists of three water treatment plants, more than 1,600 
miles (2,600 km) of water lines, 30 pumping stations and 27 storage reservoirs.[70] 
Until recently the direction of the water agency was shared between Buncombe 
County and the City of Asheville.[citation needed] The two governments 
are currently seeking agreement on water that could restore the previous 
intergovermental agency.[citation needed] The public drinking water supply 
in most areas of Asheville is presently fluoridated by the addition of 
hydrofluorosilic acid, at a rate of 0.7 parts per million[citation needed]. 
The original water system in Asheville dates from the 1880s when Asheville 
constructed a reservoir on Beaucatcher Mountain, collecting water from 
various springs and branches. Pipes were laid and unfiltered water distributed 
by gravity flowed down into the town.[citation needed] Sewer services are 
provided by the Metropolitan Sewerage District of Buncombe County, power 
provided by Duke Energy, and natural gas is provided by PSNC Energy. Asheville 
offers public transit through the ART (Asheville Redefines Transit) bus 
service that operates across the City of Asheville and to the town of Black 
Mountain. Routes originate from a central station located at 49 Coxe Avenue.[71] 
The city of Asheville is home to a Duke Energy Progress coal power plant 
near Lake Julian. This power plant is designated as having Coal Combustion 
Residue Surface Impoundments with a High Hazard Potential by the EPA.[72] 
In 2012 a Duke University study found high levels of arsenic and other 
toxins in North Carolina lakes and rivers downstream from the Asheville 
power plants coal ash ponds. Samples collected from coal ash waste flowing 
from the ponds at the Duke Energy Progress plant to the French Broad River 
in Buncombe County contained arsenic levels more than four times higher 
than the EPA drinking water standard, and levels of selenium 17 times higher 
than the agency's standard for aquatic life.[73] In March 2013 the State 
of North Carolina sued Duke Energy Progress in order to address similar 
environmental compliance issues. In July 2013 Duke Energy Corp. and North 
Carolina environmental regulators proposed a settlement in the lawsuit 
that stated coal ash threatened Asheville's water supply. The settlement 
called for Duke to assess the sources and extent of contamination at the 
Riverbend power plant in Asheville. Duke would be fined $99,100 if the 
settlement is approved.[74] Following the coal ash spill in Eden, NC resulting 
in 82,000 tons of coal ash leaking into the Dan River, the North Carolina 
DENR cancelled all previous settlements with Duke Energy. Duke said a stormwater 
drainage pipe under the utility's Dan River Steam Station lagoon ruptured 
Feb. 2, allowing ash slurry to pour into the river. Duke Energy faces future 
legislation by Tom Apodaca, republican NCGA Senate leader forcing them 
to clean up their south Asheville coal ash ponds. Tom Apodaca expects the 
legislation will be filed as soon as the General Assembly returns to session 
in May 2014. Apodaca expects the ponds will be cleaned up in 5–10 years 
under his law.[75] The city of Asheville claims a clear focus on sustainability 
and the development of a green economy. For Asheville, this goal is defined 
in their Sustainability Management Plan as: "Making decisions that balance 
the values of environmental stewardship, social responsibility and economic 
vitality to meet our present needs without compromising the ability of 
future generations to meet their needs."[76] As part of the Zero Waste 
AVL initiative, which began in 2012, each resident receives "Big Blue," 
a rolling cart in which they can put all of their materials unsorted. Residents 
can recycle a great variety of materials and "in this first year of the 
program 6.30% of waste was diverted from the landfill for recycling."[77] 
The Asheville City Council's goal is to reduce the overall carbon footprint 
80% by the year 2030. This means 4% or more reduction per year.[78] In 
2009 the reduction was made when the "City installed over 3,000 LED street 
lights, managed its water system under ISO 14001 standards for environmental 
management, improved the infrastructure and management of many of its buildings, 
and switched many employees to a 4-day work week (which saves emissions 
from commuting)."[76] Asheville is recognized by the Green Restaurant Association 
as the first city in the U.S. to be a Green Dining Destination (significant 
density of green restaurants).[79] Live music is a significant element 
in the tourism-based economy of Asheville and the surrounding area. Seasonal 
festivals and numerous nightclubs and performance venues offer opportunities 
for visitors and locals to attend a wide variety of live entertainment 
events.[80] Asheville has a strong tradition of street performance and 
outdoor music, including festivals, such as Bele Chere and the Lexington 
Avenue Arts & Fun Festival (LAAFF). One event is "Shindig on the Green," 
which happens Saturday nights during July and August on City/County Plaza. 
By tradition, the Shindig starts "along about sundown" and features local 
bluegrass bands and dance teams on stage, and informal jam sessions under 
the trees surrounding the County Courthouse. The "Mountain Dance & Folk 
Festival" started in 1928 by Bascom Lamar Lunsford is said to be the first 
event ever labeled a "Folk Festival". Another popular outdoor music event 
is "Downtown After 5," a monthly concert series held from 5 pm till 9 pm 
that hosts popular touring musicians as well as local acts. A regular drum 
circle, organized by residents in Pritchard Park, is open to all and has 
been a popular local activity every Friday evening. It is also home of 
the Moog Music Headquarters.[81] Asheville also plays host to the Warren 
Haynes Christmas Jam, an annual charity event which raises money for Habitat 
For Humanity, and attracts nationally touring acts; in addition to regular 
performers Haynes himself, and the band he plays with, Gov't Mule, past 
acts include The Allman Brothers Band, Dave Matthews Band, Ani Difranco, 
Widespread Panic. Other big acts that have played the Asheville area in 
recent years are bands such as Dawes, Porcupine Tree, Broken Social Scene, 
Ween, the Avett Brothers, Gillian Welch, Cat Power, Ghost Mice, Loretta 
Lynn, the Disco Biscuits, STS9, Pretty Lights, Primus, M. Ward and the 
Mountain Goats. DJ music, as well as a small, but active, dance community 
are also components of the downtown musical landscape. The town is also 
home to the Asheville Symphony Orchestra and the Asheville Lyric Opera 
and there are a number of bluegrass, country, and traditional mountain 
musicians in the Asheville area. A residency at local music establishment
