Guillermo "Willie" Hernández Villanueva (born November 14, 1954) is a former 
relief pitcher for the Chicago Cubs (1977–1983), Philadelphia Phillies 
(1983), and Detroit Tigers (1984–1989). He threw and batted left-handed. 
Hernández utilized the screwball.[1] In 1984, Hernandez became only the 
third player ever to win the Cy Young Award, the MVP Award, and the World 
Series title all in the same season (Sandy Koufax was the first to accomplish 
this feat, in 1963 and Denny McLain did it in 1968.) Hernández signed with 
the Philadelphia Phillies as an amateur free agent in 1973. He was selected 
by the Chicago Cubs from the Phillies in the 1976 Rule V Draft. In his 
first two years in the majors (1977 and 1978), Hernandez went 16–9 with 
a 3.03 ERA in '77 and a 3.77 ERA in '78. The Cubs gave him a try as a starter 
in 1980, but he went 1–9 that year in 7 starts and 53 games pitched. From 
1979 to 1982, Hernández was 9–19 and gave up 128 earned runs in that time. 
After being traded to the Phillies for Bill Johnson and Dick Ruthven, he 
went 8–4 with 3.29 ERA and 7 saves. The Phillies made the World Series 
that year, losing to the Baltimore Orioles in 5 games. Prior to the 1984 
season, Hernández was traded to the Detroit Tigers with Dave Bergman for 
Glenn Wilson and John Wockenfuss. He had a 9–3 record, 32 saves and a 1.92 
ERA in 140 innings pitched, while recording 112 strikeouts. In the entire 
season, Hernandez gave up only 6 home runs, 30 runs, 36 base on balls, 
and 96 hits. His 32 saves came in 33 opportunities. Hernández won the 1984 
American League Cy Young Award, beating out Dan Quisenberry. He also became 
one of the few relievers to ever win the Most Valuable Player Award (the 
others are Jim Konstanty, Rollie Fingers, and Dennis Eckersley), edging 
out Kent Hrbek. The Tigers finished 104–58 that season, and went on to 
sweep the Kansas City Royals in the American League Championship Series 
and defeat the San Diego Padres in the 1984 World Series, four games to 
one. Hernandez pitched five innings in the series, had two saves, and gave 
up only one run. His overall postseason stats include a 2–2 record and 
a 1.32 ERA in 10 games, 13 innings pitched. He walked 2, and struck out 
7. Hernández never had those numbers again, but was a solid reliever for 
the Tigers in his final years - when he became known by his given name 
Guillermo Hernández. In 1988, his second-to-last year, he went 6–5 with 
a 3.06 ERA and 10 saves in 67 innings pitched. Hernández's last MLB game 
was on August 18, 1989, before being released by Detroit. He attempted 
comebacks with the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs of the Toronto Blue Jays organization 
in 1991 and Columbus Clippers of the New York Yankees organization in 1995.
