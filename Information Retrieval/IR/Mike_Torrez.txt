Michael Augustine Torrez (born August 28, 1946) is a former pitcher in 
Major League Baseball who played for seven different teams during 18 seasons 
from 1967 through 1984. Listed at 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m), 220 pounds 
(100 kg), he batted and threw right handed. In an 18-year career, Torrez 
pitched with the St. Louis Cardinals, Montreal Expos and New York Mets, 
all of the National League, as well as for the Baltimore Orioles, Oakland 
Athletics, New York Yankees, and Boston Red Sox the American League. With 
the Yankees, he won the 1977 World Series over the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
Torrez signed as an amateur free agent with the St. Louis Cardinals in 
September 1964. He made his debut at the age of 20 with the Cardinals. 
He seldom pitched in his first two seasons. He had a breakthrough season 
in 1969, going 10–4. He was traded to the Expos mid-season on June 15, 
1971 for Bob Reynolds. In 1972 Torrez went 16–12 with a 3.33 ERA in 240 
innings. However he had control problems as he walked 103 batters. He struggled 
in 1973 going 9–12. Torrez rebounded in the 1974 season with a 15–8 win-loss 
record in 186 innings. Torrez was acquired along with Ken Singleton by 
the Baltimore Orioles from the Expos in exchange for Dave McNally, Rich 
Coggins and pitcher Bill Kirkpatrick on December 4, 1974.[1] In 1975 he 
had perhaps his best season of his career with the Orioles, going 20-9 
with a 3.06 ERA in 270.2 innings pitched. However he also led the league 
in walks with 133. Torrez was traded along with Don Baylor and Paul Mitchell 
by the Orioles to the Oakland Athletics for Reggie Jackson, Ken Holtzman 
and pitcher Bill Van Bommel on April 2, 1976.[2] Pitching with the Athletics, 
Torrez had another fine season in 1976 as he went 16–12 with a career low 
2.50 ERA. He was traded to Yankees early the next season for Dock Ellis, 
Larry Murray and Marty Perez. Torrez won two games in the 1977 World Series 
for the World Champion Yankees, both of them complete game victories, and 
won 15 or more games in 6 consecutive seasons; he caught Lee Lacy's pop-up 
bunt for the final out of that 1977 Series. After the Yankees 1977 championship 
season, he signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox, receiving a 
five-year contract worth $1.5 million.[3] He won 16 games during the 1978 
season. In the 1978 American League East tie-breaker game, he allowed a 
three-run home run to light-hitting Yankee shortstop, Bucky Dent, in the 
late innings of the division-deciding 163rd game. On January 13, 1983, 
the Red Sox traded Torrez to the New York Mets for a player to be named 
later. The Mets sent minor leaguer Mike Davis to the Red Sox to complete 
the trade. Released by the Mets on June 22, 1984, Torrez signed with the 
Athletics on July 3. They released him on August 9. In 2011 Torrez served 
as General Manager for the Newark Bears of the independent Atlantic League 
of Professional Baseball[4] until he was fired in July by the team's new
