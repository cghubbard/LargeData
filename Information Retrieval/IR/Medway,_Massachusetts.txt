Medway is a town in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, United States with a 
population of about 13,000.[2] Medway (originally Midway) was first settled 
in 1657 and was officially incorporated in 1713.[1] At that time, Medway 
began as a farming community of two hundred thirty-three. It was not long 
before the water power of the Charles River and Chicken Brook stimulated 
the formation of cotton and paper mills, straw and boot factories, and 
a variety of cottage industries. Medway demonstrates the central importance 
of the Charles River and the thriving town that grew alongside it. Today, 
the one-room schoolhouses are gone and the country stores have moved to 
the mall, but the open town meetings continue. After nearby Medfield was 
established as a town in 1651, an increasing number of newcomers settled 
on the land west of the Charles River. By 1712, this settlement west of 
the Charles had grown large enough to petition the Massachusetts General 
Court for the creation of a separate new town. That petition was granted, 
and the town of Medway incorporated on October 25, 1713. At its founding 
by Henry Garnsey, and for 170 years afterward, the town of Medway included 
the land that is now Millis. Eventually, the eastern section of the town, 
known as East Medway, separated in 1885 to form the town of Millis, and 
Medway assumed the shape it has today. The main cause for the independent 
formation of Millis from Medway was the physical separation caused by a 
massive tract of undevelopable land appropriately named in those times, 
the Great Black Swamp. The Black Swamp was at the geographical center point 
of Medway and East Medway. Had the land been developable, this would have 
been the ideal location for a central meeting house, as well as churches 
and schools. However, because the thick forest/swamp was completely undevelopable, 
this forced inhabitants of Medway and East Medway to form separate communities 
with their own respective necessities such as a meeting house and churches. 
Despite this natural separation, the town remained as one for over 170 
years. The oldest road in Medway was laid out in 1670 and was known for 
years as Old Mendon Road. Since that time, this road has been known by 
many names including The Road to the Wilderness, The Old County Road, The 
Middle Post Road, and most recently, Village Street. Village Street runs 
from the Millis border on the east and meanders along the Charles River 
before eventually joining Main Street just before the Bellingham border 
on the west. The heart of the old town of Medway is found along this road, 
with the central location of activity at Medway Village, where Holliston 
Street intersects with Village Street. In 1869, all of the streets in Medway 
were officially named. Many streets ended up losing their original names, 
and were instead named after influential townspeople of the past and present. 
Some examples of this were; Pine Hill Road became Winthrop Street, Vine 
Lane became Kelley Street, Candlewood Island Road was named Oakland Street, 
and The Old Hartford Turnpike was named Main Street. A few other examples 
of roads in Medway named after past residents include Lovering Street, 
Adams Street, Partridge Street, Ellis Street, Clark Street, Coffee Street, 
and Barber Street. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town 
has a total area of 11.5 square miles (30 km2), of which, 11.4 square miles 
(30 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) of it (0.78%) is 
water. Medway is the geographical center between Boston, Worcester, and 
Providence, which is purported by some to explain the origin of the name. 
However, like many New England cities and towns, it most likely derived 
its name from an English location, in this case, the town of Medway, England, 
or the River Medway. As of the census[13] of 2000, there were 12,448 people, 
4,182 households, and 3,337 families residing in the town. The population

Intensity of the Independent Women's Football League began playing its 
home games at Medway's Hanlon Field. In 2008, the Bay State Renegades, 
of the New England Football League, began playing their home games at Hanlon 
Field. The team won four of the five games played at their new home. In 
2007, the Worcester Wildcats, also of the NEFL, relocated for one season 
to Hanlon Field as their home in Worcester underwent significant renovations.
