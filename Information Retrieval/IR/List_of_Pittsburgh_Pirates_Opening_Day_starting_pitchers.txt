The Pittsburgh Pirates are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They play in the National League Central division. 
In their history, the franchise has also played under the name Pittsburg 
Alleghenys. They played in the American Association from 1882 through 1886, 
and have played in the National League since 1887. The first game of the 
new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named 
the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player 
who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season,[1] though there 
are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start 
on Opening Day.[2] The Pirates have used 71 Opening Day starting pitchers 
since they began to play as a Major League team in 1882. The Pirates have 
a record of 69 wins and 60 losses in their Opening Day games.[3][4][5] 
The Pirates have played in several different home ball parks. Between 1882 
and 1909 they played in two parks called Exposition Park and in Recreation 
Park. They played in Forbes Field from 1909 to 1970 and Three Rivers Stadium 
from 1970 to 2000 and they have played in their current stadium, PNC Park, 
since 2001. They had a record of no wins and one loss in the first Exposition 
Park, four wins and no losses in Recreation Park and no wins and two losses 
in the second Exposition Park. They had a record of four wins and two losses 
at Forbes Field and a record of five wins and eight losses at Three Rivers 
Stadium. Through 2010, they have a record of two wins and one loss at PNC 
Park. That gives the Pirates an overall Opening Day record of 15 wins and 
14 losses at home. They have a record of 54 wins and 46 losses in Opening 
Day games on the road.[3][4][5] Bob Friend has made the most Opening Day 
starts for the Pirates, with seven. Babe Adams and Frank Killen each made 
five Opening Day starts for the Pirates, and Deacon Phillippe, Howie Camnitz, 
Cy Blanton and Bob Veale each made four Opening Day starts. Ed Morris, 
Pud Galvin, Wilbur Cooper, Ray Kremer, Rip Sewell, Steve Blass, Dock Ellis, 
Rick Rhoden and Doug Drabek all made three Opening Day starts for the Pirates.[3] 
Several Pittsburgh Pirates Opening Day starting pitchers have been elected 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame, including Galvin, Burleigh Grimes, Waite 
Hoyt, Jim Bunning, and Bert Blyleven.[6] Bunning was elected as both a 
United States congressman and senator from Kentucky after retiring from 
baseball.[7][8] The Pirates have won nine National League titles, in 1901, 
1902, 1903, 1909, 1925, 1927, 1960, 1971 and 1979.[9] They went on to win 
the World Series in 1909, 1925, 1960, 1971 and 1979 (the modern World Series 
begin in 1903).[9] Sam Leever was the Pirates Opening Day starting pitcher 
in 1901, Phillippe was the Opening Day starting pitcher in both 1902 and 
1903, Camnitz was the Opening Day starting pitcher in 1909, Emil Yde in 
1925, Kremer in 1927, Friend in 1960, Ellis in 1971 and Blyleven in 1979.
