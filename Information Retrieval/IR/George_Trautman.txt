George M. "Red" Trautman (January 11, 1890 â€“ June 25, 1963) was an American 
baseball executive and college men's basketball coach. As an undergraduate 
at the Ohio State University, Trautman was a three-sport letterwinner in 
football, basketball and baseball. After graduation he became an assistant 
athletic director under Lynn St. John. As assistant athletic director, 
Trautman was instrumental in helping to establish the Ohio Relays. When 
St. John gave up his basketball coaching duties, he assigned them to Trautman. 
Trautman held the position of men's basketball head coach for three years. 
In those three years he had an overall record of 29-33. In 1933 Trautman 
became president of the Columbus Red Birds, a minor league baseball team. 
Three years later, Trautman was named president of the American Association, 
the league in which the Red Birds played. He held that position from 1936 
through 1945. Trautman moved the office of the league from Durham, North 
Carolina to Columbus, Ohio. In 1946 Trautman was named General Manager 
of the Detroit Tigers, succeeding Jack Zeller.[1] After two seasons with 
the Tigers, Trautman was appointed as the new President of the National 
Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, succeeding William Bramham. 
Trautman held that position from 1947 until his death in 1963. Under Trautman's 
leadership, a new relationship was forged between the major leagues and 
the minor leagues. Territorial rights, which had been in dispute, were 
established so that if the major leagues took over a National Association 
city, compensation would be due to both the existing team and its league. 
Each year, the Topps Company, in conjunction with Minor League Baseball, 
awards the George M. Trautman Award to the Topps Player of the Year in
