History People Overview Grounds Teams The St. Louis Cardinals, a professional 
baseball franchise based in St. Louis, Missouri, compete in the National 
League (NL) of Major League Baseball (MLB). Prior to entering the NL in 
1892, they were also a member of the American Association (AA) from 1882 
to 1891.[a] They have won 11 World Series titles as an NL team, one pre-World 
Series championship and tied another against the NL. Since 1900, the team 
has been known as the Cardinals. They were originally named the Perfectos.[1] 
Baseball teams like St. Louis employ a manager to make on-field decisions 
for the team during the game, similar to the head coach position of other 
sports. A number of coaches report to the manager, including the bench 
coach, first and third base coaches, and pitching and hitting coaches, 
among other coaches and instructors. Mike Matheny, a former catcher for 
the Cardinals from 2000 to 2004, has been the manager since 2012. He is 
signed through 2017.[2] Matheny is one of 63 total individuals who have 
managed the Cardinals, more than any other Major League franchise.[3] Between 
1882 and 1918 – 37 total seasons – 37 different managers stayed the helm. 
Ned Cuthbert became the first manager of the then-Brown Stockings in 1882, 
serving for one season. Also an outfielder for a former St. Louis Brown 
Stockings club, he was directly responsible for bringing professional baseball 
back to St. Louis after a game-fixing scandal expelled the earlier team 
from the NL in 1877. He rallied a barnstorming team that attracted the 
attention of eventual owner Chris von der Ahe, who directly negotiated 
for the team to be a charter member of a new league, the AA, in 1882.[4] 
Charles Comiskey was the first manager in franchise history to hold the 
position for multiple seasons. He also owns the highest career winning 
percentage in franchise history at .673, four American Association pennants 
(1885–1888) and one interleague championship (before the official World 
Series existed).[b] He also held the record for most career wins in team 
history with from 1884 to 1945 (563 total) and games managed (852) until 
1924. However, von der Ahe changed managers more than any other owner in 
team history – a total of 27 in 19 season oversaw the team on the field. 
After the Robison era began, stability marginally improved: nine managers 
in 20 years from 1899 to 1918. Jack McCloskey, Roger Bresnahan, and Miller 
Huggins each managed three or more seasons from 1906 to 1917, becoming 
the first group to manage multiple seasons in succession. Branch Rickey, 
known mainly as a general manager, surpassed Comiskey's record for games 
managed in 1924, totaling 947 in seven seasons.[5] His replacement, Rogers 
Hornsby – also the second baseman who won two Triple Crowns and six consecutive 
batting titles – finally guided the Cardinals to their first modern World 
Series championship against the formidable New York Yankees, their first 
interleague championship in exactly 40 years. Sam Breadon, the Cardinals' 
owner, also frequently changed managers (although Frankie Frisch and Gabby 
Street both managed at least five seasons and won one World Series title 
apiece in the 1930s out of nine total managers in 30 seasons) until settling 
on Hall of Famer Billy Southworth from 1940 to 1945. Southworth set new 
team records for games managed (981), wins (620) and World Series championships 
(two). His Cardinals teams won 105 or more games each year from 1942 to 
1944, winning the NL pennants in each of those three seasons. His .642 
winning percentage is second-highest in team history, and the highest since 
the Cardinals joined the National League. Southworth was also awarded the 
Sporting News Manager of the Year Award in 1941 and 1942. Starting in 1953 
with the Gussie Busch/Anheuser-Busch era, thirteen managers captained the 
club in 43 seasons. After Southworth, Eddie Dyer, Eddie Stanky, Fred Hutchinson 
and Johnny Keane also each took home a Sporting News Manager of the Year 
award. Keane's 1964 team that year's World Series. Hall of Famer Red Schoendienst 
took over from 1965 to 1977 and won one World Series and two NL pennants. 
Schoendienst then broke Southworth's team records for games (1,999 total) 
and wins (1,041). He also held records of 14 seasons managed and 955 losses. 
In the 1980s, Hall of Famer Whitey Herzog's style of play known as Whiteyball 
pushed the Cardinals to three NL pennants and a World Series championship 
in 1982. He was named the Sporting News Sportsman of the Year and Manager 
of the Year in 1982.[6] In 1990, Joe Torre took over and Tony La Russa 
succeeded him when the William DeWitt, Jr. ownership – still the current 
ownership – commenced in 1996. La Russa finished with the longest tenure 
in franchise history (16 seasons), and leads Cardinals managers in wins 
(1,408), losses (1,182), playoff appearances (nine) and is tied for most 
World Series championships (two). He also won three NL pennants. Matheny 
took over from La Russa. With DeWitt ‘s era, the Cardinals have seen their 
greatest period of managerial stability with just two managers. Besides 
La Russa, eight Cardinals managers have won a modern World Series: Hornsby, 
Frisch, Street, Dyer, Southworth, Keane, Schoendienst and Herzog; Southworth 
and La Russa are the only ones to win two each. Comiskey won one pre-World 
Series title and tied for another. Cardinals managers inducted into the 
Baseball Hall of Fame include Comiskey, Tommy McCarthy, Roger Connor, Kid 
Nichols, Bresnahan, Huggins, Rickey, Hornsby, Bill McKechnie, Southworth, 
Frisch, Schoendienst, Herzog, Torre and La Russa.[7][8] Statistics current
