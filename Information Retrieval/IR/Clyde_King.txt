As Player As Manager As Coach As General Manager Clyde Edward King (May 
23, 1924 – November 2, 2010) was an American pitcher, coach, manager, general 
manager and front office executive in Major League Baseball. King, whose 
career in baseball spanned over 60 years, was perhaps best known for his 
longtime role as a special baseball advisor to George Steinbrenner, late 
owner of the New York Yankees. During his on-field career he managed the 
San Francisco Giants (1969–70), Atlanta Braves (1974–75) and Yankees (part 
of 1982), finishing with a career record of 234 wins and 229 defeats (.505). 
Born in Goldsboro, North Carolina, King attended the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill. A 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m), 175 lb (79 kg) right-handed 
pitcher, he made his debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers at age 20 in 1944, 
his first professional season, during the manpower shortage caused by World 
War II. Although King would be sent to the minor leagues for seasoning 
after the war, he proved to be a solid member of the Brooklyn pitching 
staff (1944–45, 1947–48, 1951–52), winning 14 games for the 1951 Dodgers. 
When he finished his Major League career with the Cincinnati Redlegs in 
1953, King had appeared in an even 200 games, winning 32 and losing 25 
with an earned run average of 4.14. Before becoming a Major League manager, 
he managed several higher-level minor league clubs, including the Atlanta 
Crackers, Hollywood Stars, Phoenix Giants, Columbus Jets and Rochester 
Red Wings, and served as a pitching coach for the Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates. 
He was inducted in the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999. 
King joined the Yankees' front office in 1976 and played a number of key 
roles for almost 30 years—super scout, pitching coach, general manager 
and special advisor, in addition to managing them for the final 62 games 
of 1982. Replacing Gene Michael, he won 29 games and lost 33 as the defending 
American League champions fell to fifth place in the AL East division.[1] 
King died in his native Goldsboro at the age of 86,[2] survived by his 
wife Norma, their three daughters and sons-in-law, eight grandchildren
