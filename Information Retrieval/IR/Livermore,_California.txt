Livermore (formerly Livermores, Livermore Ranch, and Nottingham)[9] is 
a city in Alameda County, California, in the United States. With an estimated 
2014 population of 86,870,[8] Livermore is the most populous city in the 
Tri-Valley. Livermore is located on the eastern edge of California's San 
Francisco Bay Area. Livermore was founded by William Mendenhall and named 
after Robert Livermore, his friend and a local rancher who settled in the 
area in the 1840s. Livermore is the home of the Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory, for which the chemical element livermorium is named (and thus, 
placing the city's name in the periodic table).[10] Livermore is also the 
California site of Sandia National Laboratories, which is headquartered 
in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Its south side is home to local vineyards. 
The city has redeveloped its downtown district and is considered part of 
the Tri-Valley area, comprising Amador, Livermore and San Ramon valleys. 
Before its incorporation in 1796 under the Franciscan Mission San Jose, 
located in what is now the southern part of Fremont, the Livermore area 
was home to some of the Ohlone (or Costanoan) native people. Each mission 
had two to three friars and a contingent of up to five soldiers to help 
keep order in the mission and to help control the natives. Like most indigenous 
people in California, the natives in the vicinity of Mission San Jose were 
mostly coerced into joining it, where they were taught Spanish, the Catholic 
religion, singing, construction, agricultural trades and herding—the Native 
Californian people originally had no agriculture and no domestic animals 
except dogs. Other tribes were coerced into other adjacent missions. The 
Mission Indians were restricted to the mission grounds where they lived 
in sexually segregated "barracks" that they built themselves with padre 
instruction. The population of all California missions plunged steeply 
as new diseases ravaged the Mission Indian populations—they had almost 
no immunity to these "new to them" diseases, and death rates over 50% were 
not uncommon.[12] The Livermore-Amador Valley after 1800 to about 1837 
was primarily used as grazing land for some of the Mission San Jose's growing 
herds of mission cattle, sheep and horses. The herds grew wild with no 
fences and were culled about once a year for cow hides and tallow—essentially 
the only money-making products produced in California then. The dead animals 
were left to rot or feed the California grizzly bears which then roamed 
the region. The secularization and closure of the California missions, 
as demanded by the government of Mexico, from 1834 to 1837 transferred 
the land and property the missions claimed on the California coast (about 
1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) per mission) to about 600 extensive ranchos. 
After the missions were dissolved, most of the surviving Indians went to 
work on the new ranchos raising crops and herding animals where they were 
given room and board, a few clothes and usually no pay for the work they 
did—the same as they had had while working in the missions. Some Indians 
joined or re-joined some of the few surviving tribes.[citation needed] 
The about 48,000-acre (19,000 ha) Rancho Las Positas grant, which includes 
most of Livermore, was made to ranchers Robert Livermore and Jose Noriega 
in 1839.[13][14] Most land grants were given with little or no cost to 
the recipients. Robert Livermore (1799-1858)[15] was a British citizen 
who had jumped from a British merchant sailing ship stopping in Monterey, 
California, in 1822. He became a naturalized Mexican citizen who had converted 
to Catholicism in 1823 as was required for citizenship and legal residence. 
After working for a number of years as a majordomo (ranch foreman), Livermore 
married on 5 May 1838 the widow Maria Josefa de Jesus Higuera (1815–1879), 
daughter of Jose Loreto Higuera, grantee of Rancho Los Tularcitos, at the 
Mission San José. Livermore, after he got his rancho in 1839, was as interested 
in viticulture and horticulture as he was in cattle and horses, despite 
the fact that about the only source of income was the sale of cow hides 
and tallow. In the early 1840s he moved his family to the Livermore valley 
to his new rancho as the second non-Indian family to settle in the Livermore 
valley area, and after building a home he was the first in the area in 
1846 to direct the planting of vineyards and orchards of pears and olives. 
Typical of most early rancho dwellings, the first building on his ranch 
was an adobe on Las Positas Creek near the western end of today's Las Positas 
Road. After the Americans took control of California in 1847 and gold was 
discovered in 1848, he started making money by selling California longhorn 
cattle to the thousands of hungry California Gold Rush miners who soon 
arrived. The non-Indian population exploded, and cattle were suddenly worth 
much more than the $1.00-$3.00 their hides could bring. With his new wealth 
and with goods flooding into newly rich California, in 1849 Livermore bought 
a two-story "Around the Horn" disassembled house that had been shipped 
about 18,000 miles (29,000 km) on a sailing ship around Cape Horn from 
the East Coast. It is believed to be the first wooden building in the Livermore 
Tri-Valley.[citation needed] During the Gold Rush, Livermore's ranch became 
a popular "first day" stopping point for prospectors and businessmen leaving 
San Francisco or San Jose and headed for Sacramento and the Mother Lode 
gold country. Most horse traffic went by way of Altamont Pass just east 
of Livermore. Robert Livermore was a very accommodating host and welcomed 
nearly all that stopped by with lodging and meals.[citation needed] Robert 
Livermore died in 1858 and was buried at Mission San Jose before the establishment 
of the town that bears his name. His ranch included much of the present-day 
city. The city of Livermore, named in honor of Robert Livermore, was established 
in 1869 by William Mendenhall,[16] who had first met Livermore while marching 
through the valley with John C. Fremont's California Battalion in 1846 
as they were recruited to occupy the surrendering Californio towns captured 
by the U.S. Navy's Pacific Squadron. California became the 31st state in 
1850 when California's non-Indian population jumped from about 8,000 in 
1846 to about 120,000 in 1850 as shown in a corrected 1850 U.S. California 
Census.[17] California had enough population and enough wealth in 1850 
that they bypassed the territorial status of most other states and were 
allowed to more or less choose their own (large) boundaries. The Livermore 
Ranch post office, in Robert Livermore's home, operated from 1851 to 1853.[9] 
The first significant settlement of Livermore was Laddsville, on what is 
now Junction Avenue, which grew up around the hotel established by Alphonso 
Ladd in 1864. The official U.S. post office in Livermore opened in 1869.[9] 
The original Western Pacific Railroad Company in 1869 built its railroad 
connection from Oakland to Sacramento over the nearby Altamont Pass in 
the east and Niles Canyon on the west with a stop in Livermore on land 
donated by William M. Mendenhall. This made Livermore a "railroad town"[18] 
and greatly accelerated town growth. The population of Livermore in 1869, 
before the railroad arrived, is thought to have been about 75.[19] By 1870 
the Western Pacific had been absorbed by the Central Pacific Railroad as 
part of the First Transcontinental Railroad. Central Pacific was later 
acquired by the Southern Pacific Railroad and then the Union Pacific Railroad, 
which owns the tracks through town today, although these are primarily 
the tracks of the "second" Western Pacific Railroad that was founded in 
1903 and absorbed into the UP in 1983.[citation needed] Private grade schools 
were operating in Livermore from the 1860s on. The Livermore Collegiate 
Institute was founded in 1870, and the Union High School (later called 
Livermore High) graduated its first class of students in 1896. Petroleum 
was discovered near Livermore and become a valuable asset. Extensive coal 
deposits were mined near Corral Hollow by the Livermore Coal Company. In 
September 1871 Laddsville mostly burned down, and the people rebuilt their 
homes and businesses nearer the railroad in what is now downtown Livermore. 
Until 1875 the townspeople enjoyed bull fights in a small bullring on many 
Sundays, and on other occasions a captured grizzly bear might be pitted 
against a longhorn bull. Apparently, roping a grizzly was thought then 
to be a great sport. As the town grew there were a fire company, churches, 
a bank, and a library that were formed by 1876. Livermore was officially 
incorporated by the state as a city on April 15, 1876, its original city 
limits being the line a block north of 1st Street on the north and Livermore 
Avenue (then Lizzie Street) on the east. The part of the west side north 
of 5th Street was bounded by Q Street, and the part of it south of 5th 
Street by I Street. The part of the south side east of I Street was bounded 
by 6th Street, and the part of it west of I Street by 5th Street.[20] During 
Livermore's early years, it was well known for large hotels that graced 
the downtown street corners, before new buildings replaced them. Livermore 
after the 1880s is also notable for the Wente Vineyards, Concannon Vineyard, 
Cresta Blanca Winery and many other wineries. Since it has a Mediterranean 
climate, gravelly soil, warm days and cool nights, it was a good location 
to grow wine grapes. By 1880 the extensive winter wheat and hay crop lands 
were being replaced by vineyards. Extensive chromite deposits were found 
and exploited for a time. In 1885 the Remillard Brick Company was producing 
an extensive line of bricks and employing over 100 men. A telephone line 
connected Livermore to Arroyo Valley by 1886, and electric lights were 
introduced by 1889. By 1890 Livermore had over 20 miles (32 km) of streets.[21] 
Livermore originally had a Boot Hill called the Old Knoll Cemetery.[22] 
In 1909 the Livermore Carnegie Library and Park opened after taking advantage 
of a Carnegie library grant. As the city grew and larger libraries were 
needed, other libraries were built, and the original site was converted 
into a historic center[23] and park. In 1942, the U.S. government bought 
692 acres (280 ha) of ranch land, bounded by Vasco and Greenville roads 
and East Avenue, and built the Livermore Naval Air Station. The primary 
mission of the base was to train Navy pilots. This facility operated until 
it was decommissioned in 1946 after the end of World War II. On 5 January 
1951, the Bureau of Yards and Docks, U.S. Navy, formally transferred the 
former NAS Livermore in its entirety to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) 
for use by the University of California's Radiation Laboratory. In 1952, 
the government established Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), 
named after famous physicist Ernest O. Lawrence, as the site of a second 
laboratory for the study of nuclear energy like the research being done 
at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The laboratory was run by the University 
of California. Edward Teller was a co-founder of LLNL and was both its 
director and associate director for many years.[24] In 1956, the California 
campus of Sandia National Laboratories opened across East Avenue from LLNL. 
Both LLNL and Sandia are technically on U.S. government property just outside 
the city's jurisdiction limits, but with employment at LLNL at about 6,800 
and Sandia/California at about 1,150 they are Livermore's largest employers.

photo site.[26] The Livermore Valley is located about 30 miles (48 km) 
east of and behind the first coastal range of foot hills that surround 
the San Francisco Bay Area. The Livermore Valley has an east-west orientation 
with mountain passes on the west and east connecting the Bay Area and the 
Central Valley. The passes are used by railroads and highways to connect 
the two regions. Livermore Valley is about 15 miles (24 km) long (east 
to west), 10 miles (16 km) wide (north to south), and surrounded by California 
coastal range mountains and foothills. Watercourses draining the city of 
Livermore include Arroyo Mocho, Arroyo Valle, Arroyo Seco and Arroyo Las 
Positas. The principal aquifer underlying the city is the Mocho Subbasin. 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area 
of 25.2 square miles (65 km2), over 99% of it land. Several local seismic 
areas of activity lie near the city, including the Greenville Fault and 
the Tesla Fault. The soil is primarily gravel with excellent drainage. 
The gravel is used in several gravel extraction sites outside the city. 
The gravelly soil and Mediterranean climate increases the flavor concentration 
in the grapes planted in the soil. Livermore has a Mediterranean climate,[27] 
although it is close to a semi-arid climate because of its relatively low 
annual precipitation. It features with warm to hot, dry summers and mild 
to cool, wet winters (Köppen climate classification Csa). Summer (June–October) 
daytime temperatures average in the 75 to 85 °F (24 to 29 °C) range, but 
sometimes reach 100 °F (38 °C) and can occasionally approach 110 °F (43 °C). 
Summer nights, however, are normally much cooler, with lows in the 50 to 
60 °F (10 to 16 °C) range. The valley's passes direct the normal west to 
east flow of air through the valley. Usually there is a strong evening 
wind in the summer that brings cool air off the Pacific Ocean into the 
Livermore valley as it heads towards the much hotter Central Valley. This 
wind is strong enough with an average summer wind speed of about 9 miles 
per hour (14 km/h) and predictable enough to make the Livermore hills covered 
with wind turbines mounted in Altamont Pass. The period from June to September 
is extremely dry and is characterized by clear skies, but in late summer, 
subtropical moisture occasionally surges into the Livermore Valley, bringing 
high humidity, monsoon clouds, and, much less commonly, thunderstorms. 
Nearly all of the 14.6 inches (370 mm) of annual Livermore rainfall comes 
in the September to May time period, but about 50% of the days are sunny 
during this period with no appreciable cloud cover. The peak rainy months 
are December to March. Most rainstorms are classified as 50% light rain, 
32% moderate rain, 11% heavy rain and less than 6% thunder showers.[28] 
The coldest months are December and January, with a mean high of about 
56 °F (13 °C) and a low of about 38 °F (3 °C) with some occasional frost 
possible on clear mornings. The temperature can drop to as low as the 20 
to 25 °F (−7 to −4 °C) range on an exceptionally cold night. Snow is very 
rare, but light dustings do occur on the surrounding hills and occasionally 
in the valley. The record high temperature is 115 °F (46 °C), recorded 
on September 3, 1950, and the record low temperature is 18 °F (−8 °C), 
recorded on January 5, 1961, and December 9, 1972.[29] Livermore is run 
by a Council–manager government with a four-member City Council[32] elected 
for four years plus a two-year elected mayor and a “professional” City 
Manager. The council meets at 7 p.m. the second and fourth Mondays of each 
month at Council Chambers, 3575 Pacific Ave., Livermore. Twice a month 
they hear citizen input and presumably relay this information to the City 
manager who actually runs the city day to day. John Marchand (Mayor), Stewart 
Gary (Vice Mayor), Doug Horner, Laureen Turner and Bob Woerner are the 
present city council members. The Mayor is paid $1,400 per month and the 
other council members are paid $980 per month. In addition they are eligible 
for a $90 per month cell phone allotment and health care benefits up to 
a maximum of $2,119/month plus other city paid insurance and retirement 
contributions to CaLPERS or PARS ARS of which the city pays 18% or 1.3% 
of their salary respectively. The City Manager, Marc Roberts, was nominally 
hired by the city council for a five-year term and can, in principle, be 
fired by them if needed. Marc Roberts is paid a salary of $196,320/year 
with about $64,500/year medical, insurance and retirement benefits paid 
by the city. The City Manager has a staff of five to assist him. The City 
Attorney, John Pomidor, is hired by the city council and generally handles 
all legal matters for the city, from traffic tickets to civil lawsuits 
to acting as a general counsel, giving legal advice for city departments. 
Pomidor is paid a salary of $186,593 /year with medical, insurance and 
retirement benefits of about $62,600 per year paid by the city. The City 
Attorney has a staff of 7.5 FTE to assist him. Unions and bargaining units 
representing the 451 Livermore City Employees[33] Nearly all have their 
own union agreements and retirement systems which in general cost at least 
city paid: $7,500 per year for health benefits,life and AD&D insurance, 
short and long term disability Insurance, 1.45% medicare, 18.1% of salary 
contribution for retirement benefits which can be used at age 55 at a rate 
of 2.7% times years of service time salary or 3.0% times years of service 
times salary at age 50 for police officers, 100% of health insurance paid 
after retirement with 25 or more years of service, tuition and 75% text 
book reimbursement, uniform allowance, 80–192 hours of vacation per year, 
12 paid holidays per year, etc.[34] The Livermore Police Department, or 
the LPD,[35] was established in 1876, at that time the only law enforcement 
agency in the San Francisco Bay Area besides the San Francisco Police Department. 
The Livermore Police Department has 135 members including 83 sworn officers 
and 45 nonsworn full-time personnel who operate on a $25 million budget 
each year. The police department has two divisions: operations and support. 
The current chief of police is Michael Harris. In July 2008, the LPD opened 
its first substation in New Downtown Livermore, known as the Central Station 
or Downtown Office. The main police station is located in the City Hall 
center at 1052 S. Livermore Ave. The Livermore Police Department Dispatch 
Center employs 18 public safety dispatchers with one supervising public 
safety dispatcher that are on duty 24/7 to handle 911 emergency calls. 
The Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department provides fire and advanced life 
support services to the cities of Livermore and Pleasanton. It serves an 
estimated population of 150,000 (78,000 in Livermore, and 71,000 in Pleasanton) 
over 44 square miles (114 km2) (23 square miles (60 km2) in Livermore, 
and 21 square miles (54 km2) in Pleasanton) with an operating budget of 
$28,000,000. In 2008 the LPFD responded to approximately 11,000 calls for 
service. The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) Local 1974 
represents its 112 members. The public schools in Livermore are part of 
the Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District (LVJUSD) with headquarters 
at 685 East Jack London Blvd. The district has 11 elementary (K-5 and K-8) 
schools, three middle schools (grades 6-8), two comprehensive high schools, 
and three alternative high schools. As of the 2012-2013 school year, the 
public school superintendent was Kelly Bowers, who was hired by the elected 
school board in 2010. The five members of the Board of Education are elected 
to alternating four year terms by the voters of the community. Each December, 
the board reorganizes itself by selecting a board president and clerk of 
the board. The president of the board (2014) is Kate Runyon. Chuck Rogge 
is the clerk of the board, while Anne White, Bill Dunlop and Thomas McLaughlin 
are board members. They hold regular public meetings on the first and third 
Tuesday of the month at 7:00 p.m. in the School Board Room at 685 East 
Jack London Blvd. Livermore has about 30 pre-schools and day care centers.[41][42] 
There are two charter schools in Livermore, one K-8 and one high school, 
both operated by the Tri-Valley Learning Corporation, a local 501(c)3 not-for-profit 
organization formed by the parents and teachers who founded the two charter 
schools. The Hertz Foundation for scholarships is based in Livermore Junction 
ave k-8. The Livermore Area Recreation and Park District (LARPD) is a special 
independent, non-profit (501(c) organization) park district that was created 
by the vote of the public in 1947 and runs the parks and other facilities 
in the city of Livermore and most of the unincorporated areas of eastern 
Alameda County. LARPD operates 42 facilities,[49] including neighborhood, 
special use, community and regional parks and sport fields, a family campground 
at South Lake Tahoe, the Ravenswood Historic Site, The Barn, the Veterans 
Building, the Carnegie Building, the Bothwell Recreation Center and the 
new Robert Livermore Community Center. LARPD runs the May Nissen Community 
Park and Swim Center[50] at 685 Rincon Ave and is open to swimmers with 
a $0.25 admission price from mid-June through end of August—closed Sundays. 
May Nissen Park includes a tot lot, group picnic area, barbecue pits, picnic 
tables, preschool, basketball court, restrooms, horseshoe pits, softball 
areas, tennis courts, two swimming pools, and a dog park. Max Baer Park 
has been the home of the Intermediate Little League World Series since 
2013. Brushy Peak Regional Preserve, located near Livermore, is jointly 
operated by the Livermore Area Recreation and Park District and the East 
Bay Regional Park District. The extensive gravel deposits around Livermore 
have led to extensive gravel extraction that is still on-going. Shadow 
Cliffs Park along Stanley Boulevard west of Livermore is a popular 266-acre 
(108 ha) park that includes a 80-acre (32 ha) lake in an old Kaiser Industries 
gravel pit and is used extensively today for swimming, boating, and fishing.[51][52] 
Del Valle Regional Park, 10 miles (16 km) south of Livermore, includes 
a 5-mile-long (8.0 km) lake with all kinds of water-oriented recreation. 
The parking/entrance fee is $6 per vehicle and $4 more per trailered boat. 
The park opens at 6 AM in the summer and 7 AM in the winter. It has approximately 
5,000 acres (2,000 ha) of oak-covered hills that can be used for hiking, 
horseback riding, and nature study. The lake is used by sailboats, sailboards 
and fishing boats as well as recreational swimmers. Del Valle Park has 
the eastern gateway to the Ohlone Wilderness Trail, a 28-mile (45 km) scenic 
back country hiking trail. The Del Valle Family Campground has 150 sites, 
21 of them with water and sewage, and electrical hook-ups. Picnicking sites 
are available.[53] LARPD operates parks and facilities of 1,842 acres (745 ha), 
with 1,432 acres (580 ha) open space. It runs an extensive selection of 
classes on a wide variety of subjects. LARPD has its own, five-person board 
of directors[54] that is elected by the citizens to staggered four-year 
terms and meets at 7 p.m. on the second and last Wednesday of each month 
inside the Cresta Blanca Ballroom at the Robert Livermore Community Center, 
4444 East Avenue. They are paid $100/meeting with a maximum of $500/month. 
The General Manager of LARPD is Timothy Barry—selected by the board and 
paid $137,160/yr plus unspecified benefits including Alameda County retirement 
plan (ACERA) with 29.13% of LARPD salary contribution rate to a well paid 
retirement plan.[55] In addition, there are 13 paid holidays, vacation, 
sick leave, medical, dental, life insurance, etc. adding about $55,000/yr 
in benefits to the General Manager's salary.[56][57] The organization and 
facilities are extensive[58] and LARPD hires many part-time workers (up 
to about 430 at peak times) from Park Rangers to referees in its extensive 
programs and classes with a permanent staff of about 63.[59][60] The 2012-2013 
operating budget of LARPD is $16,393,564 plus a capital budget of $3,870,971. 
Their source of operating income is property taxes, user fees, charges 
and grants. Unfortunately, the state has cut down on their share of property 
taxes as the state re-allocate more to itself and their never ending fiscal 
crisis's. LARPD serves an area that encompasses about 115,000 people. The 
2010 United States Census[64] reported that Livermore had a population 
of 80,968. The population density was 3,216.1 people per square mile (1,241.8/km²). 
The census reported that (99.4% of the population) lived in households, 
389 (0.5%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 121 (0.1%) 
were institutionalized. According to the latest census information, Livermore 
is the third wealthiest midsize (between 65,000 and 249,999 people) city 
in the nation. In 2005, the median household income in Livermore was $96,632, 
which ranked it the third highest-income midsize city, behind only the 
California cities of Newport Beach ($97,428) and Livermore's western neighbor, 
Pleasanton ($101,022).[65] There were 29,134 households, out of which 11,238 
(38.6%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 17,058 (58.6%) 
were opposite-sex married couples living together, 2,834 (9.7%) had a female 
householder with no husband present, 1,407 (4.8%) had a male householder 
with no wife present. There were 1,584 (5.4%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, 
and 206 (0.7%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. The population 
age profile was spread out with 20,636 people (25.5%) under the age of 
18, 6,176 people (7.6%) aged 18 to 24, 22,530 people (27.8%) aged 25 to 
44, 23,284 people (28.8%) aged 45 to 64, and 8,342 people (10.3%) who were 
65 years of age or older. The median age was 38.3 years. For every 100 
females there were 98.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there 
were 96.9 males. Of 5,997 households (20.6%) were made up of individuals 
and 2,099 (7.2%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. 
The average household size was 2.76. There were 21,299 families (73.1% 
of all households); the average family size was 3.19. There were 30,342 
housing units at an average density of 1,205.2 per square mile (465.3/km²), 
of which 20,399 (70.0%) were owner-occupied, and 8,735 (30.0%) were occupied 
by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 1.5%; the rental vacancy rate 
was 4.8%. 56,967 people (70.4% of the population) lived in owner-occupied 
housing units and 23,491 people (29.0%) lived in rental housing units. 
Livermore has 48,709 registered voters with 33.4% Republicans, 39.6% Democrats, 
and 18.5% Decline to State voters. Moderate candidates are normally elected.[66] 
In the California State Legislature, Livermore is in the 7th Senate District, 
represented by Democrat Steve Glazer,[5] and in the 16th Assembly District, 
represented by Republican Catharine Baker.[67] In the United States House 
of Representatives, Livermore is in California's 15th congressional district, 
represented by Democrat Eric Swalwell.[4] Livermore's culture retains some 
vestiges of the farming, wine growing and ranching traditions that have 
existed in the valley since the time of Robert Livermore, but now largely 
reflects a suburban population. Since 1918, Livermore has each June hosted 
the Livermore Rodeo,[68] called the "World's Fastest Rodeo", that claims 
it has more riders per hour than any other event of its type. There are 
several wine-tasting tours of the many Livermore area wineries that occur 
periodically throughout the summer. This culture was documented in the 
photoessay Suburbia in 1973 by then-native photographer Bill Owens, with 
the photos shown in numerous exhibits.[69] Livermore has a strong blue-collar 
element, as well as many professionals who work at the Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory and other work sites in the high tech industries within 
the Bay Area. Recent housing development has included the addition of hundreds 
of million-dollar homes set among the southside's vineyards, as well as 
a multimillion-dollar renovation of the downtown area. Renovations included 
office buildings, the Livermore Cinemas, the Bankhead Theatre,[70] and 
a multistory parking structure. The Livermore Civic Center includes a state-of-the-art 
library that opened in 2004, with a front mosaic by Maria Alquilar. Livermore 
has several golf courses located near the city: Las Positas municipal golf 
course, and the 18 hole Poppy Ridge and Wente Vineyards courses.[71] Springtown 
Golf Course closed October 15, 2015. Livermore Municipal Airport (LVK) 
is accessible to business jets, serving the entire Tri-Valley area. The 
city is home to Bay Area Rosal, a professional indoor soccer team. Each 
summer Livermore has a farmer's market which bring farm-fresh produce directly 
to the consumer. In 2010, proposed projects included extension of the BART 
high-speed rail system to Livermore, with an underground downtown station, 
and a regional performing arts center between Livermore Avenue and L Street.[72] 
Arts organizations supported by the city include the Livermore-Amador Symphony, 
Del Valle Fine Arts, producer of classical music events, and in the valley 
at large, the Valley Concert Chorale, Livermore Valley Opera, the Valley 
Dance Theatre, a classical ballet company and the Livermore Art Association. 
There are over fifty places of worship in Livermore.[73] Camp Wonder opened 
its first summer camp for children with special medical needs in Livermore 
in 2001. One of the largest districts in Livermore is Springtown, the northeast 
area of the city north of Interstate 580. Originally conceived as a retirement 
community in the early 1960s, Springtown has many of the city's hotels 
and a public golf course. The downtown area or central district has two 
movie theaters, a community theater, and space for open-air concerts. The 
North Livermore district is north of the Union Pacific Railroad that cuts 
through downtown. The South Livermore district, including areas of unincorporated 
land, has over 40 wineries. The city is noted for one world record. A 110+ 
year old 4-watt light bulb, called the Centennial Light, housed in the 
Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department main station, is still burning. It 
glows dimly, but still functions as a light bulb.[74] The Guinness Book 
of World Records, Ripley's Believe It or Not, and General Electric have 
concluded that the bulb has been burning continuously since 1901 with the 
exception of power failures and three times it was disconnected for moves 
to new stations. The light bulb was manufactured by the Shelby Electric 
Company and was hand blown with a carbon filament. The Livermore area is 
the home of two DOE National Laboratories. The laboratories are known worldwide, 
and attract significant attention both for their scientific research and 
for their major roles in developing the United States nuclear arsenal. 
The largest employer in Livermore is the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory 
(LLNL), a federally funded research and development center funded by the 
Department of Energy which is operated by a limited liability consortium 
named Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (LLNS), a joint venture 
company of Bechtel National, the University of California, BWX Technologies, 
URS, and Battelle. The lab is the location of the IBM Sequoia supercomputer. 
The lab was the co-discoverers of new superheavy elements 113, 114, 115, 
116, 117, and 118. The chemical element with atomic number 116, previously 
known as ununhexium, was given the name livermorium, after the laboratory, 
in 2012. LLNL is the location of the world's highest-energy laser,[75] 
the National Ignition Facility (NIF), a project designed to create the 
first sustained, controlled nuclear fusion reaction, which would generate 
fusion power, a potential energy source. Livermore is also the California 
site of Sandia National Laboratories, which is operated by Sandia Corporation, 
a Lockheed-Martin owned Company. The two National Laboratories, along with 
other stakeholders, including the University of California, Berkeley, UC 
Davis, and regional cities, partnered to create the i-GATE (Innovation 
for Green Advanced Transportation Excellence) National Energy Systems Technology 
(NEST) Incubator. The 15,000-square-foot (1,400 m2) i-GATE NEST campus 
was created to stimulate large-scale, high-tech business development drawn 
by the two labs. Initial focus of the campus will be solar energy, fuel 
cells, biofuels, LED lighting, and other related technologies.[76][77] 
i-GATE shares its facilities with the hackerspace Robot Garden, which provides 
public access on Saturdays from 11 AM to 3 PM.[78] One of California’s 
oldest wine regions, the Livermore Valley American Viticultural Area (AVA) 
played a pivotal role in shaping California’s wine industry. In the 1840s, 
California pioneers looking for outstanding vineyard sites began planting 
grapes in the region. Robert Livermore planted the first commercial vines 
in the 1840s. After California joined the union as the 31st state in 1850, 
pioneer winemakers C. H. Wente, a first-generation immigrant from Germany,[79] 
(founder of Wente Vineyards), James Concannon, a first generation Irishman,[80] 
(founder of Concannon Vineyard), and Charles Wetmore, a Portland Maine 
born American and pioneer of California,[81] (founder of Cresta Blanca 
Winery) recognized the area’s winegrowing potential and bought land, planted 
grapes and founded their wineries in the 1880s.[82] Charles Wetmore went 
to France in 1878 when he was appointed a delegate for the California Viticultural 
Association to the Paris Exposition. Charles was able in 1882 to obtain 
Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc, and Muscat de Bordelais cuttings from one of 
the most prestigious vineyards in France, Chateau Yquem. These superior 
clones helped revitalize the California wine industry. In 1889 Charles 
won the grand prize for his first pressing (1884) in the 1889 Paris Exposition. 
Charles shared these cuttings with other growers including C. H. Wente 
who used the Chateau Yquem grape cuttings to eventually produce their Chateau 
Wente wine. The top employers in Livermore are: Livermore's largest employers, 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory with about 6,800 employees and Sandia 
National Laboratory with 1,150 employees, are U.S. government owned facilities 
located just outside the city and are not included. Interstate 580 is Livermore's 
primary east-west six-lane freeway. I-580 passes the outskirts of Livermore 
before it heads east through the Altamont Pass to the Central Valley and 
Interstate 5. I-580 and I-5 are the main route of San Francisco Bay Area 
to Los Angeles truck shipping traffic. Interstate 680 lies about 10 miles 
(16 km) west of Livermore. Highway 84 heads southwest from I-580 to Fremont. 
Vasco Road, an unnumbered highway that is maintained by Alameda and Contra 
Costa counties, connects Livermore to Brentwood and the Sacramento–San 
Joaquin River Delta area. Livermore Municipal Airport (LVK)[86] is located 
3 miles (5 km) northwest of Livermore and is a division of the Public Works 
Department; it is owned and operated by the City of Livermore. They are 
the main airport in the Tri-Valley area. Approximately 600 aircraft are 
based on Livermore Airport, which has over 150,000 annual aircraft landings 
and take-offs each year. The airport serves private, business, and corporate 
tenants and customers and covers about 650 acres (260 ha). The main lighted 
runway is 5,250 feet (1,600 m) long.[87] The main terminal building covers 
2,400 square feet (220 m2). The airfield is accessible 24 hours a day and 
is attended by city employees during the hours listed under "Airport Services". 
The manned air traffic control tower is operated by Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) employees daily from 7:00 A.M. until 9:00 P.M. There is an open airshow 
which is held annually on the first Saturday of October from 10:00 AM to 
4:00 PM showing vintage World War-II aircraft and other displays. The WHEELS 
bus system operates in Livermore, Pleasanton, Dublin, and the surrounding 
unincorporated areas of Alameda County. It has connections to Bay Area 
Rapid Transit (BART) stations in Dublin and Pleasanton.[88] Livermore has 
two stations for the Altamont Corridor Express (ACE), a commuter train 
which runs from Stockton to the San Jose area. One station is at Vasco 
Road, and the other is in downtown Livermore at its Transit Center. The 
Transit Center has a free multistory parking garage and connections to 
the WHEELS bus system. There is a petition drive to bring the Bay Area 
Rapid Transit system to Livermore. The group that started the petition 
was founded by the former mayor of Dublin, Linda Jeffery Sailors, who was 
successful in extending BART to Dublin/Pleasanton, currently the closest 
station to Livermore.[89] If BART does come to Livermore, the system would 
connect to the ACE Train. Radio station KKIQ is licensed in Livermore and 
broadcasts in the Tri-Valley area. The Independent is a local newspaper 
founded in September 1963. It is located in the Bank of Italy Building.[90] 
Livermore has five landmarks listed on the National Register of Historic 
Places: the Bank of Italy Building, the Hagemann Ranch Historic District, 
the D. J. Murphy House, the Livermore Carnegie Library and Park and Ravenswood 
Historic Site. Bank of Italy Building Hagemann Ranch D. J. Murphy House 
Ravenswood Historic Site Livermore Carnegie Library and Park Livermore 
has three sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:[93]
