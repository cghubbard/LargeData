The 1994 Chicago White Sox season was the White Sox's 94th season in the 
major leagues, and their 95th season overall. They led the American League 
Central, 1 game ahead of the 2nd place Cleveland Indians with a record 
of 67-46, when the season was cut short by the 1994â€“95 Major League Baseball 
strike. After retiring from the National Basketball Association, Michael 
Jordan surprised the sports world by signing a major league baseball contract 
with the Chicago White Sox. He reported to spring training and was assigned 
to the MLB team. He played 17 games with the White Sox before the organization 
sent him to the Birmingham Barons on March 31, 1994.[1] Jordan has stated 
this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who had 
always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball player.[citation needed] 
By Friday, August 12, the White Sox had compiled a 67-46 record through 
113 games. They were leading the AL Central Division and had scored 633 
runs (5.60 per game) and allowed 498 runs (4.41 per game).[13] Their hitters 
had also struck out just 568 times: the fewest in the Majors. While their 
pitchers combined for just 20 saves, they did have 9 shutouts, tying the 
Oakland Athletics for the most in the Majors, and hit only 17 batters: 
the fewest among all 28 teams.[14] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
