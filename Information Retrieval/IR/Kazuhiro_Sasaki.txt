NPB MLB Kazuhiro "Daimajin" Sasaki (佐々木 主浩 Sasaki Kazuhiro, born February 
22, 1968 in Sendai City, Japan) is a former Nippon Professional Baseball 
and Major League Baseball right-handed relief pitcher. He played his entire 
NPB career with the Yokohama Taiyo Whales / Yokohama BayStars (1990–1999; 
2004–2005). Sasaki played his entire MLB career with the Seattle Mariners 
(2000–2003). After playing college baseball for Tohoku Fukushi University, 
Sasaki was drafted with the seventh pick in the first round of the 1989 
draft by the Yokohama Taiyō Whales (now named Yokohama DeNA BayStars) in 
Japan's Central League. He played for them from 1990–1999, before joining 
the Seattle Mariners in 2000. He joined a bullpen that had been one of 
the worst in the Major Leagues, and during his rookie year won the closer 
job from a floundering José Mesa. Sasaki's out pitch, a devastating split-fingered 
fastball that drops when arriving at home plate, was nicknamed "The Fang" 
by Mariners radio announcers.[1] He complemented it with a four-seam fastball 
that topped out at mid-90s. Sasaki maintained a rigorous throwing program, 
sometimes at odds with club management, that saw him throw up to 100 pitches 
following games in which he did not appear. Sasaki's transition to American 
baseball began with his being named American League Rookie of the Year. 
For three years, along with Jeff Nelson and Arthur Rhodes, Sasaki was an 
integral member of the back of Seattle's bullpen. He decided to leave the 
Mariners before the last year of his contract in 2004, giving up $8.5 million, 
citing his desire to be with his family in Japan. According to the Seattle 
Post-Intelligencer, however, Sasaki's real reason for returning to Japan 
was pressure from ownership, due to his "indiscreet philandering".[2] Sasaki 
resumed his career with the BayStars upon returning to Japan, where he 
pitched for another year. But in his second year back, nagging knee and 
elbow injuries resulted in his release from Yokohama and subsequent retirement. 
His last official appearance came as a cameo against the Tokyo Giants on 
August 9, 2005, as he struck out his longtime friend and rival Kazuhiro 
Kiyohara in a game played at Fullcast Stadium Miyagi in his hometown. In 
addition to his Rookie of the Year award, Sasaki set several Japanese professional 
baseball records, including saves (45) and save opportunities (46) for 
a single season in 1998; he was twice selected to play in the All-Star 
game, and was selected to eight All-Star teams in Japan. Sasaki's 37 saves 
in his rookie season with the Seattle Mariners remained a Major League 
Baseball record for saves by a rookie until Neftalí Feliz broke it in 2010 
with 40. In 1991, Sasaki married former idol singer Kaori Shimizu. Together 
they had two children. After returning to Japan in 2005, Sasaki continued 
his affair with actress Kanako Enomoto, who was 13 years his junior. When 
Enomoto became pregnant, Shimizu divorced Sasaki on March 18, 2005. Enomoto 
would birth prematurely on April 29, 2005.[3] Sasaki's interest in sports 
extend outside baseball. In 2002 and 2003, he lent his name to Formula 
Nippon, an auto racing series in Japan. His Team 22 won two races in that 
time. Sasaki has appeared as a judge on the Iron Chef television program. 
He had a side recording career, with an album of his vocals over techno 
beats. Sasaki chose 22 for his uniform number because he was born at 2:22 
on February 22 (2/22). The BayStars have permanently honored his number.
