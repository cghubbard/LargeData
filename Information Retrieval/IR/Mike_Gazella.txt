Michael Gazella (October 13, 1895 â€“ September 11, 1978) was an American 
major league baseball player who played for the New York Yankees on several 
championship teams in the 1920s.[1] Born in Olyphant, Pennsylvania,[2] 
Gazella played football as well as baseball at Lafayette College and Mansfield 
University of Pennsylvania.[3] In 1923, he was signed by New York and played 
in eight games for the Yankees that season. Consigned to the minor leagues 
in 1924 and 1925, he played for teams in Minneapolis and Atlanta before 
rejoining New York in the 1926 season as a utility infielder, usually playing 
third base. The Yankees played in the World Series every year Gazella was 
on the team, winning three. However, Gazella played in only the 1926 Series, 
in which the Yankees lost to the St. Louis Cardinals. After retiring, Gazella 
managed the Ponca City Angels[4] of the Western Association and the Moline 
Plowboys of the Three-I League, as well as scouted for the Yankees. Gazella 
died in an automobile accident in Odessa, Texas on September 11, 1978.
