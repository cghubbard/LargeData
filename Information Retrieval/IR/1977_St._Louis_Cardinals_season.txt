The 1977 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 96th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and its 86th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
83-79 during the season and finished third in the National League East, 
18 games behind the Philadelphia Phillies. Vern Rapp took over as the Cardinals' 
manager this year, after the twelve-year reign of their longtime manager 
Red Schoendienst. On August 29, Cardinals left-fielder Lou Brock broke 
the modern-day stolen base record, by stealing bases 892 and 893 in a game 
against the Padres in San Diego. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position;
