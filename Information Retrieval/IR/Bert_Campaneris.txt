Dagoberto Campaneris Blanco (born March 9, 1942), nicknamed 'Bert' or 'Campy', 
is a Cuban American former professional baseball player. He played in Major 
League Baseball as a shortstop for four American League teams, primarily 
the Kansas City and Oakland Athletics. One of the mainstays of the Athletics' 
championship teams of 1972 to 1974, he holds the A's franchise records 
for career games played (1795), hits (1882) and at bats (7180). He led 
the AL in stolen bases six times from 1965 to 1972 and retired with the 
seventh most steals in history (649). He led the league in putouts three 
times, and ended his career among the major league leaders in games (5th, 
2097) and double plays (7th, 1186) at his position. A small, skinny player[dubious 
– discuss] at 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) and 160 pounds (73 kg), the Cuban-born 
Campaneris was a key figure on the A's of the 1960s and 1970s. In his debut 
with Kansas City on July 23, 1964, Campaneris hit two home runs, the first 
coming on the first pitch thrown to him by Jim Kaat.[1] He is one of five 
players in major league history to hit two home runs in his first game; 
Bob Nieman (1951), Mark Quinn (1999), J. P. Arencibia (2010), and Yasmani 
Grandal (2012) are the only others to accomplish this feat. On July 23, 
1964, Campy Campaneris, was introduced on air by Monte Moore, announcer, 
by explaining a promotional gimmick by Charlie O. Finley, of Campy riding 
a donkey in from the bullpen. [2] In 1965, Campaneris led Kansas City in 
batting average (.270), and led the league in triples (12) and stolen bases 
(51), the latter mark being the highest total by an Athletic since Eddie 
Collins's 58 in 1914 with what were then the Philadelphia Athletics and 
breaking Luis Aparicio's nine-year run of the American League stolen base 
title. In 1966 he finished 10th in the voting for the AL's Most Valuable 
Player award after having a similar season at the plate, but playing more 
regularly at shortstop. When the A's moved to Oakland in 1968, he had perhaps 
his finest year, leading the league in hits (177), steals (62), and at 
bats (642); the last mark was an Oakland record until Johnny Damon broke 
it in 2001. Campaneris enjoyed another fine year in 1970, batting .279 
with career highs of 22 home runs and 64 runs batted in while leading the 
league in steals for the fifth time (42) and scoring 97 runs. He improved 
consistently on defense; his six double plays in an extra-inning game on 
September 13 of that year set an AL record, and in 1972 he led AL shortstops 
with 795 total chances while also breaking Collins' franchise record of 
376 steals. An avid bunter, he led the league in sacrifice hits in 1972 
(20), 1977 (40) and 1978 (25). In his postseason career he had 11 RBI with 
3 home runs, 4 doubles and a triple, scored 15 runs, and stole 6 bases 
in 37 games. In Game 2 of the 1972 American League Championship Series 
against the Detroit Tigers, Campaneris already had three hits, two steals 
and two runs when in the 7th inning he faced pitcher Lerrin LaGrow. After 
a pitch hit him in the ankle, Campaneris threw his bat at LaGrow. The benches 
cleared, with Detroit manager Billy Martin going after Campaneris; both 
Campaneris and LaGrow were ejected. Campaneris was fined and suspended 
for the rest of the ALCS, as well as the first seven games of the next 
season, but was permitted to play in the World Series win over the Cincinnati 
Reds. In the 1973 American League Championship Series, in which the A's 
defeated the Baltimore Orioles, he led off Game 2 with a home run, and 
won Game 3 with a leadoff home run in the 11th inning; in Game 7 of that 
year's World Series against the New York Mets, both he and Reggie Jackson 
hit two-run home runs in the third inning off Jon Matlack—the only two 
home runs Oakland would hit the entire series. The A's took a 4–0 lead 
and went on to win the game and repeat as world champions; Campaneris caught 
Wayne Garrett's pop-up for the final out of the Series. In 1974 he broke 
Jimmy Dykes' franchise mark for career at bats (6023), and in 1976 he broke 
Dykes' mark for games played (1702), as well as Al Simmons' Athletics record 
of 1827 career hits. After the 1976 season, he signed with the Texas Rangers, 
but he saw his playing time reduced in 1978. In May 1979 he was traded 
to the California Angels, and he split time at shortstop over the next 
two seasons with Jim Anderson and Freddie Patek before playing as a reserve 
third baseman in 1981. After spending 1982 in the Mexican League, Campaneris 
returned to the majors for a last hurrah in 1983 with Billy Martin's New 
York Yankees. He batted a career-high .322 in 60 games at second and third 
base before retiring. In his 19-year career Campaneris batted .259 with 
79 home runs, 646 RBI, 1181 runs, 2249 hits, 313 doubles, and 86 triples 
in 2328 games. His 649 stolen bases placed him 7th in major league history, 
and behind only Ty Cobb and Eddie Collins in the AL. His Athletics record 
of 566 steals was broken by Rickey Henderson in 1990; Henderson also surpassed 
his Oakland records for career triples and at bats. Campaneris retains 
the Athletics franchise records for career games (1702), putouts (2932), 
assists (5021) and double plays (934) at shortstop. On September 8, 1965, 
as part of a special promotion featuring the popular young player, Campaneris 
became the first player to play every position in a major league game.[3] 
On the mound, he pitched ambidextrously, throwing lefty to left-handers, 
and switched against right-handers. Since then, César Tovar (Twins, 1968), 
Scott Sheldon (Rangers, 2000) and Shane Halter (Tigers, 2000) have joined 
this select list of nine-position players in a major league game. On March 
12, 2015, actor Will Ferrell played in five Major League Baseball Spring 
training games at all nine positions to honor Campaneris. Following his 
retirement, Campaneris wanted to coach in the Major Leagues, but no one 
gave him a chance. He then landed a few minor league opportunities, until 
the Seibu Lions offered him a job to coach defense and base running with 
them in 1987. And Campaneris added a new highlight to his résumé, as the 
Lions won the Japan Series in both 1987 and 1988.[4] Afterwards, Campaneris 
played for the Gold Coast Suns of the Senior Professional Baseball Association 
in its inaugural season of 1989. As the oldest everyday player in the league 
at 47, he hit .291 and stole 16 bases in 60 games. Campaneris currently 
lives in Scottsdale, Arizona, and often participates in Old-Timers' games 
around the country. He also conducts baseball camps and is an active participant 
in the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association, often playing
