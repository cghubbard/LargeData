Charles Abraham Essegian, Jr. (born August 9, 1931) is a former backup 
outfielder who played from 1958 through 1963 in Major League Baseball. 
Listed at 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m), 200 lb., he batted and threw right-handed.[1] 
A native of Boston, Massachusetts, Essegian attended Stanford University 
in Palo Alto, California. He entered the majors in 1958 with the Philadelphia 
Phillies, playing for them one year before joining the St. Louis Cardinals 
(1959), Los Angeles Dodgers (1959–1960), Baltimore Orioles (1961), Kansas 
City Athletics (1961, 1963) and Cleveland Indians (1961–1962). His most 
productive season came in 1962, when he posted career numbers in batting 
average (.274), runs (59), hits (92), doubles (12), home runs (21), runs 
batted in (50) and games played (106).[1] Essegian enjoyed two of his finest 
seasons in Cleveland, where he was a fan favorite. In a six-season career, 
Essegian was a .255 hitter (260-for-1018) with 47 home runs and 150 RBI 
in 1018 games.[1] During the 1959 World Series, Essegian set a Series record 
with two pinch-hit home runs against the Chicago White Sox. The mark would 
be matched by Bernie Carbo of the Boston Red Sox, who pinch-hit homers 
against the Cincinnati Reds in the 1975 Series.[2] Following his career 
in the majors, Essegian played for the Kintetsu Buffaloes of the Pacific 
League in 1964. He also played twelve Minor league seasons between 1953 
and 1959, registering a .311 average with 97 homers in 1422 games appearances.[3][4] 
Essegian is one of only two men to have played in both the Rose Bowl and 
the World Series. He played for Stanford University in the 1952 Rose Bowl 
event and appeared with the Dodgers in the 1959 Series. Jackie Jensen was 
the first to appear in both, while playing for University of California
