Shelby Dade Foote, Jr. (November 17, 1916 – June 27, 2005) was an American 
historian and novelist who wrote The Civil War: A Narrative, a three-volume 
history of the war. With geographic and cultural roots in the Mississippi 
Delta, Foote's life and writing paralleled the radical shift from the agrarian 
planter system of the Old South to the Civil Rights era of the New South. 
Foote was little known to the general public until his appearance in Ken 
Burns's PBS documentary The Civil War in 1990, where he introduced a generation 
of Americans to a war that he believed was "central to all our lives."[1] 
Foote did all his writing by hand with a nib pen, later transcribing the 
result into a typewritten copy.[2][3] Foote was born in Greenville, Mississippi, 
the son of Shelby Dade Foote and his wife Lillian (née Rosenstock). Foote's 
paternal grandfather, Huger Lee Foote (1854–1915), a planter, had gambled 
away most of his fortune and assets. His paternal great-grandfather, Hezekiah 
William Foote (1813–99), was an American Confederate veteran, attorney, 
planter and state politician from Mississippi.[4] His maternal grandfather 
was a Jewish immigrant from Vienna. Foote was raised in his father's and 
maternal grandmother's Episcopal faith.[5] As his father advanced through 
the executive ranks of Armour and Company, the family lived in Greenville, 
Jackson, and Vicksburg, Mississippi, as well as Pensacola, Florida and 
Mobile, Alabama. Foote's father died in Mobile when Foote was five years 
old; he and his mother moved back to Greenville to live with her sister's 
family.[6] Foote was an only child, and his mother never remarried.[7] 
When Foote was 15 years old, Walker Percy and his brothers LeRoy and Phinizy 
Percy moved to Greenville to live with their uncle — attorney, poet, and 
novelist William Alexander Percy — after the death of their parents. Foote 
began a lifelong fraternal and literary relationship with Walker; each 
had great influence on the other's writing. Foote edited The Pica, the 
student newspaper of Greenville High School, and frequently used the paper 
to lampoon the school's principal. In 1935, Foote applied to the University 
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, hoping to join with the older Percy boys, 
but was denied admission because of an unfavorable recommendation from 
his high school principal. He presented himself for admission anyway, and 
as result of a battery of admissions tests, he was accepted.[7] In 1936 
he was initiated in the Alpha Delta chapter of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. 
Interested more in the process of learning than in earning an degree, Foote 
was not a model student[dubious – discuss]. He often skipped class to explore 
the library, and once he even spent the night among the shelves. He also 
began contributing pieces of fiction to Carolina Magazine, UNC's award-winning 
literary journal.[7] Foote returned to Greenville in 1937, where he worked 
in construction and for a local newspaper, The Delta Democrat Times. Around 
this time, he began to work on his first novel. In 1940 Foote joined the 
Mississippi National Guard and was commissioned as captain of artillery. 
After being transferred from one stateside base to another, his battalion 
was deployed to Northern Ireland in 1943. The following year, Foote was 
charged with falsifying a government document relating to the check-in 
of a motor pool vehicle he had borrowed to visit a girlfriend in Belfast, 
Teresa Lavery—later his first wife—who lived two miles beyond the official 
military limits. He was court-martialed and dismissed from the Army. Shelby 
and Teresa divorced while she was living with his mother in New Orleans, 
after Shelby sent her to the U.S. on a warship convoy. After the war, Teresa 
married Kermit Beahan, the Nagasaki atomic bomb bombardier, in Roswell, 
New Mexico. Foote came back to the United States and took a job with the 
Associated Press in New York City.[7] In January 1945, he enlisted in the 
United States Marine Corps but was discharged as a private in November 
1945, never having seen combat.[7] During his training with the Marines, 
he recalled a fellow Marine asking him, "You used to be a[n] Army captain, 
didn't you?" When Foote said yes, the fellow replied, "You ought to make 
a pretty good Marine private." Foote returned to Greenville and took a 
job with a local radio station, but he spent most of his time writing. 
He sent a section from his first novel to the The Saturday Evening Post. 
"Flood Burial" was published in 1946, and when Foote received a $750 check 
from the Post as payment, he quit his job to write full-time.[7] Foote's 
first novel, Tournament, was published in 1949. It was inspired by his 
planter grandfather, who had died two years before Foote's birth. For his 
next novel, Follow Me Down (1950), Foote drew heavily from the proceedings 
of a Greenville murder trial he attended in 1941 for both the plot and 
characters.[7] Love in a Dry Season was his attempt to deal with the "so-called 
upper classes of the Mississippi Delta" around the time of the Great Depression. 
Foote often expressed great affection for this novel, which was published 
in 1951.[1] In Shiloh (1952) Foote foreshadows his use of historical narrative 
as he tells the story of the bloodiest battle in American history to that 
point from the first-person perspective of seven different characters. 
Actually, the narrative is presented by 17 characters – Confederate soldiers 
Metcalf, Dade, and Polly; and Union soldiers Fountain, Flickner, with each 
of the twelve named soldiers in the Indiana squad given one section of 
that chapter. A close reading of this work reveals a very complete interlocked 
picture of the characters connecting with each other (Union with Union, 
Confederate with Confederate). Jordan County: A Landscape in Narrative, 
was published in 1954 and is a collection of novellas, short stories, and 
sketches from Foote's mythical Mississippi county.[1] September, September 
(1978) is the story of three white Southerners who plot and kidnap the 
8-year-old son of a wealthy African-American, told against the backdrop 
of Memphis in September, 1957. Although he was not one of America's best-known 
fiction writers, Foote was admired by his peers—among them the aforementioned 
Walker Percy, Eudora Welty, and his literary hero William Faulkner, who 
once told a University of Virginia class that Foote "shows promise, if 
he'll just stop trying to write Faulkner, and will write some Shelby Foote."[7] 
Foote's fiction was recommended by both The New Yorker and critics from 
The New York Times Book Review.[1] Foote moved to Memphis in 1952. Upon 
completion of Jordan County: A Landscape in Narrative, he resumed work 
on what he thought would be his magnum opus, Two Gates to the City, an 
epic work he'd had in mind for years and in outline form since the spring 
of 1951. He had trouble making progress and felt he was plunging toward 
crisis with the "dark, horrible novel". Unexpectedly, he received a letter 
from Bennett Cerf of Random House asking him to write a short history of 
the Civil War to appear for the conflict's centennial. According to Foote, 
Cerf contacted him based on the factual accuracy and rich detail he found 
in Shiloh, but Walker Percy's wife Bunt recalled that Walker had contacted 
Random House to approach Foote. Regardless, though Foote had no formal 
training as a historian, Cerf offered him a contract for a work of approximately 
200,000 words.[7] Foote worked for several weeks on an outline and decided 
that his plan couldn't be done to Cerf's specifications. He requested that 
the project be expanded to three volumes of 500,000 to 600,000 words each, 
and he estimated that the entire project would be done in nine years.[7] 
Upon approval for the new plan, Foote commenced writing the comprehensive 
three volume, 3000-page history, together entitled The Civil War: A Narrative. 
The individual volumes are Fort Sumter to Perryville (1958), Fredericksburg 
to Meridian (1963), and Red River to Appomattox (1974). Foote supported 
himself during the twenty years he worked on the narrative with Guggenheim 
Fellowships (1955–1957), Ford Foundation grants, and loans from Walker 
Percy.[1][7] Foote labored to maintain his objectivity in the narrative 
despite his Southern upbringing. He deliberately avoided Lost Cause mythologizing 
in his work. He developed new respect for such disparate figures as Ulysses 
Grant, William T. Sherman, Patrick Cleburne, Edwin Stanton and Jefferson 
Davis. By contrast, he grew to dislike such figures as Phil Sheridan and 
Joe Johnston.[8] He considered United States President Abraham Lincoln 
and Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest to be two authentic geniuses 
of the war. When he stated this opinion in conversation with one of General 
Forrest's granddaughters, she replied after a pause, "You know, we never 
thought much of Mr. Lincoln in my family."[1] The work received generally 
favorable reviews, though scholars criticized Foote for not including footnotes 
and for neglecting subjects such as economics and politics of the Civil 
War era.[1][7] After finishing September, September, Foote resumed work 
on Two Gates to the City, the novel he had set aside in 1954 to write the 
Civil War trilogy. The work still gave him trouble and he set it aside 
once more, in the summer of 1978, to write "Echoes of Shiloh", an article 
for National Geographic Magazine. By 1981, he had given up on Two Gates 
altogether, though he told interviewers for years afterward that he continued 
to work on it.[7] In the late 1980s, Ken Burns had assembled a group of 
consultants to interview for his Civil War documentary. Foote was not in 
this initial group, though Burns had Foote's trilogy on his reading list. 
A phone call from Robert Penn Warren prompted Burns to contact Foote. Burns 
and crew traveled to Memphis in 1986 to film an interview with Foote in 
the anteroom of his study. In November 1986, Foote figured prominently 
at a meeting of dozens of consultants gathered to critique Burns' script. 
Burns interviewed Foote on-camera in Memphis and Vicksburg in 1987. In 
1987, he became a charter member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers 
at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. When Burns’s documentary 
aired in September 1990, Foote appeared in almost 90 segments, about one 
hour of the 11-hour series. Foote’s drawl and erudition made him a favorite. 
He was described as "the toast of Public TV", "the media's newest darling", 
and "prime time's newest star", and the result was a burst of book sales. 
In one week at the end of September 1990, each volume of the paperback 
The Civil War: A Narrative sold 1,000 copies per day. By the middle of 
1991, Random House had sold 400,000 copies of the trilogy. Foote later 
told Burns, "Ken, you've made me a millionaire." Foote's substantive commentary 
in the Burns film dealt with a wide variety of battles, characters military 
and civilian, and issues. He also explained a puzzling question on nomenclature: 
why does the same battle often have two names? Foote's answer: Northerners 
are usually from cities, so rivers and streams are noteworthy; whereas 
Southerners are usually rural, so they find towns noteworthy.[9] Some examples 
are the First and Second Battles of Bull Run, known as First and Second 
Manassas, and the Battle of Antietam, also called the Battle of Sharpsburg. 
Foote professed to be a reluctant celebrity. When The Civil War was first 
broadcast, his telephone number was publicly listed and he received many 
phone calls from people who had seen him on television. Foote never unlisted 
his number, and the volume of calls increased each time the series re-aired.[7] 
Many Memphis natives were known to pay Foote a visit at his East Parkway 
residence in Midtown Memphis. Horton Foote, the playwright and screenwriter 
(To Kill A Mockingbird, Baby the Rain Must Fall and Tender Mercies) was 
the voice of Jefferson Davis in the PBS series. The two Footes are third 
cousins; their great-grandfathers were brothers. "And while we didn't grow 
up together, we have become friends; I was the voice of Jefferson Davis 
in that TV series", Horton Foote added proudly.[10] In 1992 Foote received 
an honorary doctorate from the University of North Carolina. In the early 
1990s, Foote was interviewed by journalist Tony Horwitz for the project 
on American memory of the Civil War which Horwitz eventually published 
as Confederates in the Attic (1998). Foote was also a member of The Modern 
Library's editorial board for the re-launch of the series in the mid-1990s. 
(This series published two books excerpted from his Civil War narrative. 
Foote also contributed a long introduction to their edition of Stephen 
Crane's The Red Badge of Courage giving a narrative biography of the author.) 
He also received the 1992 St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis 
University Library Associates.[11][12] Foote was elected to the American 
Academy of Arts and Letters in 1994. Also in 1994, Foote joined Protect 
Historic America and was instrumental in opposing a Disney theme park near 
battlefield sites in Virginia.[7] Along the way, Burns asked him to return 
for his upcoming documentary Baseball, where he appeared in both the 2nd 
Inning discussing his recollections of the dynamics of the crowds in his 
youth and in the 5th Inning (TV series), where he gave an account of his 
meeting Babe Ruth. In one of his last television projects, Foote narrated 
the three-part series The 1840 Carolina Village, produced by award-winning 
PBS and Travel Channel producer C. Vincent Shortt in 1997. "Working with 
Shelby was a genuinely illuminating and humbling experience", said Shortt. 
"He was the kind of academician who could weave a Civil War story into 
a discussion about fried green tomatoes — and do so without an ounce of 
presumption or arrogance. He was a treasure."[citation needed] On September 
2, 2001, Shelby Foote was the focus of the C-SPAN television program In-Depth. 
In a 3-hour interview, conducted by C-SPAN founder Brian Lamb, Foote shows 
off the library of his home, working room, and writing desk, and details 
the writing of his books as well as taking on-air calls.[13] In 2003 Foote 
received the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award. The Helmerich 
Award is presented annually by the Tulsa Library Trust. Foote died at Baptist 
Hospital in Memphis on June 27, 2005, aged 88. He had had a heart attack 
after a recent pulmonary embolism.[14] He was interred in Elmwood Cemetery 
in Memphis. His grave is beside the family plot of General Forrest.[15] 
These two books published by the Modern Library are excerpted from the 
three-volume narrative. The former was a whole chapter in the second volume, 
and the latter excerpted from the second volume where some material was 
interspersed with other events. Both were also presented as unabridged
