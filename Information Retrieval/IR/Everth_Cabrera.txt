Everth Cabrera (born November 17, 1986) is a Nicaraguan professional baseball 
infielder who is currently a free agent. He previously played in MLB for 
the San Diego Padres and Baltimore Orioles. He led the National League 
(NL) in stolen bases in 2012, and was an All-Star in 2013. Cabrera began 
his professional career in 2006, playing in the Colorado Rockies organization 
for the Casper Rockies. In 54 games, he hit .254 with 18 stolen bases. 
In 2007, he played for the Tri-City Dust Devils and Modesto Nuts, hitting 
.300 with 12 stolen bases in 150 at bats for the former and .267 in 15 
at-bats for the latter. While with the Asheville Tourists in 2008, in 121 
games he hit .284 with 73 stolen bases—more than any other minor leaguer.[1] 
He was selected by the Padres from the Rockies minor league system in the 
Rule 5 draft on December 11, 2008.[2] Cabrera stole 9 bases in spring training 
2009 for the Padres, and made the opening day roster as a backup infielder. 
As a Rule 5 draftee, the Padres were required to keep Cabrera on the 25-man 
roster throughout the 2009 season. He got his first hit in the major leagues 
on April 8, a double off of Cory Wade of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 
seventh inning at Petco Park. Cabrera had a solid rookie year debut despite 
losing two months to a hand injury,[3] batting .255 with 25 steals and 
59 runs scored in 103 games with the Padres, but he also led all NL shortstops 
with 23 errors. On August 7, Cabrera hit a walk-off grand-slam off the 
Mets closer Francisco Rodríguez in the bottom of the 9th, capping a Padres 
win 6 – 2. Cabrera helped defeat the Arizona Diamondbacks on September 
16 (F/10, 6-5) with a game-winning, walk-off RBI that scored another fast 
rookie, Luis Durango.[citation needed] In November 2009, Cabrera was named 
Nicaragua's Professional Sports Athlete of the Year.[citation needed] Cabrera 
was the Padres Opening Day shortstop in 2010, but only played in 76 games 
that year due to a nagging right hamstring injury. His performance also 
fell off significantly compared to 2009, and the Padres signed Jason Bartlett 
in the offseason to be their regular shortstop.[4] Cabrera spent the majority 
of the 2011 season with the Triple-A Tucson Padres, only appearing with 
the Major League club in two games in mid-July. Cabrera separated his shoulder 
at the end of the 2011 season, and the injury continued to bother him into 
spring training in 2012, where Cabrera said he "couldn't swing 100 percent" 
and didn't feel good about the shoulder.[5] Cabrera started the 2012 season 
with the Tucson Padres where he posted a .333 batting average and .389 
on-base percentage in 34 games. On May 17, he was called up to the major 
league club when Bartlett was sent to the disabled list after a poor start 
to the year,[6] and Cabrera became the Padres everyday shortstop. Cabrera 
had an exceptional year on the basepaths in 2012. On July 14 in a game 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Cabrera stole home in the 9th inning to 
score the tying run. The eventual winning run then scored when pitcher 
Kenley Jansen threw the ball past the catcher. This was the first time 
in nearly 30 years that a regular season MLB game was won with the tying 
or go-ahead run scoring on a steal of home in the 9th inning or later.[7] 
In a September 30 game, he became the first player in 14 years to steal 
four bases without recording a hit.[8] Cabrera became the first Padre to 
lead the NL in stolen bases with 44. He set a team record with a 91.7 percent 
success rate on steals (44-for-48), which also led the NL.[9][10] He also 
set Padres team records with 24 consecutive stolen bases without being 
caught to start the season, and 28 straight successful steals dating back 
to 2010.[11][12] Cabrera finished the season batting .246, with a .324 
on-base percentage, in a career-high 115 games played. After the 2012 season, 
Cabrera played for the Nicaragua national baseball team for the 2013 World 
Baseball Classic Qualifying Tournament Cabrera opened 2013 as the Padres 
shortstop and started 69 consecutive games at the position before he went 
to the 15-day disabled list in mid-June with a hamstring injury.[13] On 
May 14, Cabrera collected the 60,000th hit in Padres history.[14] He was 
selected to the All-Star team as a reserve, having a .291 batting average, 
.373 on-base percentage, and 34 stolen bases at the break. On August 5, 
2013, Cabrera was suspended 50 games, the remainder of the Padres' season, 
by Major League Baseball for using performance-enhancing drugs from Biogenesis. 
At the time of the suspension, he was leading the National League with 
37 stolen bases. Cabrera ended the year with a .283/.355/.381 line in 95 
games played.[citation needed] Cabrera batted .232 in 90 games during the 
2014 season. He became a free agent on December 2, 2014 after he was non-tendered 
by the Padres.[15] On February 25, 2015, Cabrera and the Baltimore Orioles 
finalized a one-year contract for the 2015 season. The deal was worth $2.4 
million.[16][17] He was designated for assignment by Baltimore on June 
5,[18] and was released on June 13. He hit just .208 in 29 games as a member 
of the Orioles.[19] On July 16, 2015, Cabrera signed a minor league deal 
with the Giants yet batted just .231 at Triple-A Sacramento. [20] Cabrera 
was not called up to the majors when rosters expanded on September 1, and 
was released the next day after refusing to suit up for Sacramento. [21] 
During spring training of 2013, Everth Cabrera's name was reported to have 
appeared in documents retrieved from the Biogenesis clinic which listed 
him as having received the clinic's products.[22] MLB officials were investigating 
the head of the clinic, Anthony Bosch, and his ties to performance-enhancing 
drugs. Cabrera said he was "a little surprised" and "disappointed" by the 
report, which said Cabrera's name was listed next to a dollar amount and 
a date of March.[23] At the time of the report, Cabrera spoke to both manager 
Bud Black and general manager Josh Byrnes, and Black said they were "satisfied" 
and that "We believe this will resolve itself in a positive way".[23] After 
completing an investigation in August, MLB suspended Cabrera and 12 other 
players for involvement with the Biogenesis clinic. Cabrera was one of 
12 players receiving 50-game suspensions, all of whom made a deal with 
MLB to not appeal the decision.[24] In a press conference on the day of 
his suspension, Cabrera admitted to taking a banned substance and apologized 
to fans and his teammates. He did not specify the substance, but said he 
took it briefly after he realized that his shoulder was still not healthy 
as spring training was approaching in 2012.[25] He also stated that he 
did not initially seek out the substance, but it was presented to him by 
a consultant employed by his former agents.[24] The same agency has been 
linked to all 12 players who received 50-game suspensions in the scandal.[26] 
During spring training in 2012, Cabrera was arrested on a charge of assault 
stemming from an incident of domestic violence.[27] Prosecutors dismissed 
the charge in June.[28] An officer of the California Highway Patrol arrested 
Cabrera on September 3, 2014, on suspicion of driving under the influence 
of marijuana.[29] In November 2014, Cabrera was charged with resisting 
arrest.[30] In February 2015, Cabrera reached a plea deal with San Diego 
County and received a sentence of three years probation, a $655 fine, and
