Timothy Stephen "Tim" Wakefield (born August 2, 1966) is an American former 
professional baseball pitcher. Wakefield began his pitching career with 
the Pittsburgh Pirates, but is most remembered for his 17-year tenure with 
the Boston Red Sox, starting in 1995 and ending with his retirement in 
2012 as the longest-serving player on the team.[1] Wakefield, at the time 
of his retirement, was the oldest active player in the majors. Known for 
his signature knuckleball, Wakefield won his 200th career game on September 
13, 2011 against the Toronto Blue Jays, and is third on the Boston Red 
Sox with 186 team victories, behind both Cy Young and Roger Clemens. He 
is second in all-time wins at Fenway Park with 97, behind Roger Clemens' 
100, and is first all-time in innings pitched by a Red Sox pitcher, with 
3,006, having surpassed Roger Clemens' total of 2,777 on June 8, 2010.[2][3] 
Wakefield was nominated eight times for the Roberto Clemente Award, winning 
the award in 2010.[4] Wakefield was born in Melbourne, Florida on August 
2, 1966. He attended Eau Gallie High School and then attended Florida Tech. 
At Florida Tech, he was named the Panthers team MVP as a first baseman 
in his sophomore and junior years. He set single-season records with 22 
home runs and 71 RBI, as well as the career home run record at 40. In 2006, 
his number 3 was retired by the college.[5] Wakefield was drafted as a 
first baseman in 1988 by the Pittsburgh Pirates. After a scout told him 
that he would never get above Double-A ball as a position player with his 
skills, Wakefield began developing the knuckleball that has made him so 
well known, at the time stating "I just want to be able to say I tried 
everything I could to make it".[6] The following season, Wakefield made 
his professional pitching debut while playing for the Single-A Salem Buccaneers. 
His immediate success led to a full conversion to pitcher in 1990, and 
he led the Carolina League in starts and innings pitched. Wakefield advanced 
to Double-A in 1991 and continued to improve, leading all Pirates minor 
leaguers in wins, innings pitched, and complete games when he went 15–8 
with a 2.90 ERA.[6] In 1992, Wakefield began the season with the Triple-A 
Buffalo Bisons of the American Association. He registered a league-high 
6 complete games by July 31—winning 10 games with a 3.06 ERA—and was called 
up to the majors. In his major league debut, Wakefield threw a complete 
game against the St. Louis Cardinals, striking out 10 batters while throwing 
146 pitches.[7] Down the stretch, Wakefield provided a boost for the playoff-bound 
Pirates, starting 13 games and compiling an 8–1 record with a 2.15 ERA, 
a performance that won him the National League Rookie Pitcher of the Year 
Award from The Sporting News. After winning the National League East division, 
the Pirates faced the Atlanta Braves in the National League Championship 
Series. Wakefield won both of his starts against Braves star Tom Glavine, 
throwing a complete game 5-hitter in Game Three of the NLCS and another 
complete game in Game Six on three days' rest. With the Pirates leading 
the Braves in Game Seven, Wakefield was poised to be named NLCS MVP until 
the Braves rallied for 3 runs in the bottom of the ninth off Stan Belinda.[8] 
During the first month of the 1993 season, Wakefield walked nine batters 
twice and ten in another start. After losing his spot in the starting rotation, 
Wakefield was sent down to Double-A. He was recalled in September and struggled 
again, but finished the season with two straight shutouts. Wakefield spent 
most of 1994 with Triple-A Buffalo. He led the league in losses, walks, 
and home runs allowed. Wakefield was recalled to the Pirates in September 
but he did not play due to the players strike.[9] The Pirates released 
Wakefield on April 20, 1995.[10] Six days after being released from the 
Pirates, Wakefield was signed by the Boston Red Sox.[1] He worked with 
Phil and Joe Niekro, two former knuckleballers, who encouraged him to use 
the knuckleball as an out pitch. In Triple A Pawtucket, Wakefield went 
2–1 with a 2.53 ERA. With the Boston Red Sox rotation struggling from injuries 
to top of the rotation starters Roger Clemens and Aaron Sele early in the 
1995 season, Wakefield was called up from Triple A, and soon proved to 
be their most dependable starter.[11] He began the season with a 1.65 ERA 
and a 14–1 record through 17 games – 6 of which were complete games. He 
ended the year 16–8 with a 2.95 ERA, helping the Red Sox win the American 
League East division title, and capturing the Sporting News American League 
Comeback Player of the Year. He finished third in the AL Cy Young Award 
balloting. Over the next three seasons (1996–1998), Wakefield won 45 games 
and had ERAs of 5.14, 4.25 and 4.58 over the three seasons as a starter. 
In 1997, he led Major League Baseball by hitting 16 batters with a pitch. 
He would repeat this feat in 2001 plunking a career-high 18 batters. In 
1999, Boston's closer Tom Gordon was injured and manager Jimy Williams 
installed Wakefield as the new closer during the middle part of the season. 
On August 10, 1999, he joined a select group of pitchers who have struck 
out four batters in one inning. Because the fluttering knuckleball produces 
many passed balls, several knuckleballers share this honor with him. He 
recorded fifteen saves before Derek Lowe emerged as the new closer and 
Wakefield returned to the starting rotation. Because of his success out 
of the bullpen, Wakefield was regularly moved from the position of relief 
pitcher to starter and back again over the next three seasons (2000–2002). 
After being moved back into the rotation in late July 2002, Wakefield became 
a permanent regular starter. In the 2003 ALCS, Wakefield allowed four runs 
over 14 innings against the New York Yankees. He started Games One and 
Four of the Series against Mike Mussina and won both starts. He was also 
called in to pitch in extra innings of Game Seven, after the Yankees tied 
the game. The Red Sox had been leading 5–2 in the eighth inning. After 
retiring the side in order in the 10th, Wakefield gave up a home run to 
Aaron Boone on his first pitch of the 11th, sending the Yankees to the 
World Series. Wakefield apologized to fans after the game. In 2004, Wakefield 
helped the Red Sox win the ALCS against the Yankees, a best-of-seven series 
to advance to the World Series. The Red Sox lost the first two games of 
the ALCS and were losing badly in Game Three when Wakefield asked to be 
put into the game to save the other pitchers for the next day. He pitched 
3⅓ innings which prevented him for starting Game Four.[12] Derek Lowe started 
Game Four in his place which the Red Sox ultimately won. In Game Five, 
Wakefield again pitched out of the bullpen and was the winning pitcher 
in a 14-inning game, throwing three shutout innings as the Red Sox won 
5–4. The Red Sox beat the Yankees and went on to the World Series. He pitched 
Game One of the 2004 World Series but did not get a decision as Boston 
defeated the Cardinals, 11–9. The Red Sox swept the Cardinals for their 
first World Series title in 86 years. On April 19, 2005, Wakefield agreed 
to a $4 million, one-year "rolling" contract extension that gave the Red 
Sox the ability to keep Wakefield for the rest of his career.[13] In the 
2005 season, Wakefield led the Red Sox pitching staff with 16 wins and 
a 4.15 ERA. On September 11, 2005, he set a career high in strikeouts (12) 
in a 1–0 complete game loss to the New York Yankees.[14] In 2007, he finished 
the season with a 17–12 record but was left off the Red Sox roster for 
the World Series due to an injured shoulder that had been bothering him 
since late September.[15] The 12 passed balls while he was pitching topped 
the majors in 2008.[16] Wakefield entered his fifteenth season with the 
Boston Red Sox in 2009.[17] On April 15, 2009, a day after the Red Sox 
bullpen was tasked with pitching over 11 innings of relief, Wakefield told 
Terry Francona: "I understand the circumstances and I just wanted you to 
know: Whatever happens, don't take me out; let me keep going." He went 
on to carry a no-hitter into the eighth inning, and earned a complete-game 
win.[18] At 42, this made him the oldest Red Sox pitcher to pitch a complete 
game, a record he would break himself in his next start when he pitched 
a second consecutive complete game win, this time in a seven-inning, rain-shortened 
game.[19] Wakefield led the team with a 10–3 record through June 27.[20] 
With his start on July 3, 2009, Wakefield surpassed Roger Clemens for the 
most starts in franchise history.[21] His success on the mound had him 
atop the major leagues with 10 wins at the time of the 2009 All Star selection. 
On July 5, 2009, he was announced as an AL All-Star, making him the second-oldest 
first-time All-Star at 42, behind only Satchel Paige who was 45.[22] By 
the All Star break, Wakefield possessed a major league-best 11–3 record.[23] 
Wakefield did not see action in St. Louis, as he was not needed by Joe 
Maddon. Wakefield missed the next six weeks with a lower back and calf 
injury. He made his next start on August 26 against the Chicago White Sox 
and pitched 7 innings with 1 earned run and no decision. Wakefield entered 
his 16th season with the Boston Red Sox in 2010. He began the year in the 
starting rotation until Daisuke Matsuzaka came off the disabled list. He 
later rejoined the rotation due to an injury to Josh Beckett. On May 12, 
Wakefield recorded his 2000th career strikeout against Vernon Wells of 
the Toronto Blue Jays in a 3-2 loss. He joined Jamie Moyer, Javier Vázquez, 
and Andy Pettitte as the only active pitchers with at least 2000 career 
strikeouts. On June 8, Wakefield passed Roger Clemens for the most innings 
pitched by a Red Sox pitcher. He went on to win that game 3-2 over the 
Cleveland Indians. On June 13, Wakefield joined Moyer and Pettitte as the 
only active pitchers with 3,000 innings pitched. He accomplished this feat 
by retiring Shane Victorino of the Philadelphia Phillies on a fly ball 
to left. On July 2, he surpassed Clemens for another record, this for starts 
at Fenway; he went 8 innings to win 3-2 over the Baltimore Orioles. On 
September 8, against the Tampa Bay Rays, he became the oldest Red Sox pitcher 
ever to win a game; he is also the oldest player to appear in a game for 
the Red Sox at Fenway.[24] On October 28, before Game 2 of the 2010 World 
Series, Wakefield received the Roberto Clemente Award. His 2011 season 
was followed in the documentary film Knuckleball!.[25][26] Wakefield started 
his seventeenth season in a Red Sox uniform as a reliever. Injuries to 
John Lackey and Daisuke Matsuzaka moved him into the starting rotation. 
On May 11, 2011, Wakefield pitched 1⅓ innings in relief as the Toronto 
Blue Jays defeated the Red Sox 9–3 at the Rogers Centre. He became, at 
44 years, 282 days, the oldest player ever to appear for the Red Sox. At 
the All-Star break, Wakefield had a 5-3 record with a 4.74 ERA.[27] On 
July 24, 2011, while pitching against the Seattle Mariners, Wakefield recorded 
his 2,000th strikeout in a Red Sox uniform against Mike Carp. He also recorded 
his 199th career win in that game. It took Wakefield eight attempts to 
earn his 200th career win after his 199th, finally doing so in an 18-6 
rout over the Toronto Blue Jays at Fenway Park on September 13, 2011. The 
victory came at a time when the Red Sox were in dire need of wins, with 
the Tampa Bay Rays gaining substantial ground in the race for the American 
League wild card as Boston fell four games behind the New York Yankees 
in the AL East division standings. Boston eventually missed the playoffs 
by one game, and Wakefield ended the season at 7-8 with a 5.12 ERA. For 
the 2012 season, Wakefield was offered a minor league contract, with an 
invitation to spring training, by the Red Sox. Wakefield announced his 
retirement on February 17, 2012.[28] Wakefield finished his Red Sox career 
third in wins (behind Roger Clemens and Cy Young), second in strikeouts 
(behind Clemens), second in game appearances by a pitcher (behind reliever 
Bob Stanley), first in games started as a pitcher, and first in innings 
pitched. Because of the difficulty of catching a knuckleball, the Red Sox 
sometimes carried a backup catcher who specialized in defense and who caught 
most or all of Wakefield's starts. For several years, his personal catcher 
was Doug Mirabelli, who used a league-approved mitt similar to a softball 
catcher's mitt for catching Wakefield. Josh Bard briefly caught Wakefield 
during the first month of the 2006 season, before Boston reacquired Mirabelli 
on May 1 after trading him to San Diego the previous offseason. Mirabelli 
was released in the spring of 2008 and Wakefield's catcher was Kevin Cash 
during 2008. George Kottaras became his personal catcher in 2009. Victor 
Martinez was acquired by the Red Sox on July 31, 2009 and began catching 
for Wakefield on August 26, 2009. Martinez experimented catching Wakefield's 
pitches with various gloves and mitts before settling on a first baseman's 
mitt.[29] Due to injuries to both Martinez and Jason Varitek, Boston reacquired 
Kevin Cash from the Houston Astros on July 1, 2010, to serve as Wakefield's 
catcher as well as the primary catcher. Martinez became Wakefield's catcher 
once more when he returned. In 2011, Wakefield began the season in the 
bullpen and both Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Jason Varitek caught him when 
he entered games. When Wakefield returned to the rotation, Saltalamacchia 
was the catcher in each game he started. Wakefield pitched with what is 
said to be a slow sidearm motion, but is actually a ¾-overhand motion. 
This also revealed some of his pitches to hitters, because they can see 
his hand. Wakefield's primary pitch, the knuckleball, is normally thrown 
about 64–68 mph and has a great deal of variance in how much it 'flutters'. 
The flutter of his knuckleball depended on a variety of factors including 
temperature, humidity, precipitation (both type and intensity), air resistance, 
wind speed, wind direction, the condition of the ball, and very small changes 
in his grip or the orientation of the seams. Wakefield also featured a 
71–75 mph fastball, a slow curve (57-61 mph), and a slower version of his 
knuckleball (59-62 mph). Knuckleball pitchers are traditionally believed 
to be able to pitch more frequently and for more pitches per game than 
conventional pitchers. Throughout the first decade of his career, Wakefield 
followed a similar pattern: on April 27, 1993, he threw 172 pitches over 
10+ innings in a game for the Pittsburgh Pirates against the Atlanta Braves.[30] 
In his first two weeks with the Red Sox, Wakefield pitched a total of 33⅓ 
innings, including two complete games in addition to a 7⅓-inning emergency 
start on just two days' rest.[31] As late as the 2003 and 2004 ALCS, Wakefield 
was making relief appearances between starts. In the later years of his 
career, the Red Sox generally treated Wakefield more like conventional 
pitchers in terms of pitch count, rarely allowing him to pitch more than 
about 110 pitches per game, and giving him four days of rest. Also, because 
of the relatively low wear on their pitching arms, knuckleball pitchers 
tend to have longer professional careers than most other pitchers. At the 
time of his retirement, Tim Wakefield was 7th on the all-time hit batters 
list. Due to the designated hitter rule, Wakefield only batted for the 
Red Sox when playing in National League parks. While with the Pirates, 
a National League team, he had a .071 and a .163 batting average in his 
two years. He hit the only home run of his career in 1993.[32] His career 
batting average was .117.[32] Wakefield was well known throughout Major 
League Baseball as one of its most charitable players. He was nominated 
eight times by the Red Sox for the Roberto Clemente Award, presented to 
the player who best reflects the spirit of giving back to the community, 
winning the award in 2010.[33] Since 1998, Wakefield has partnered with 
the Franciscan Hospital for Children in Boston to bring patients to Fenway 
Park to share time with him on and off the field. He has also hosted an 
annual celebrity golf tournament for 18 years. Wakefield has also been 
active with New England's Pitching in for Kids organization (a program 
dedicated to improving the lives of children across the New England region), 
the Space Coast Early Intervention Center in Melbourne, Florida, and the 
Touch 'Em All Foundation founded by Garth Brooks. In 2007, Wakefield released 
a charity wine called CaberKnuckle in association with Longball Vineyards 
with 100% of the proceeds supporting Pitching In For Kids and raised more 
than $100,000.[34] In 2013, the Red Sox named Wakefield Honorary Chairman 
of the Red Sox Foundation. In that role, Wakefield supports fundraising 
events, community service days and personal visits.[35] In June 2012, Wakefield 
joined NESN as a studio analyst for Red Sox coverage. In August 2015, Wakefield 
signed on as a spokesperson for Farmington Bank by making appearances at 
branch grand openings and television, radio and print advertisements.[36] 
Wakefield was part owner of a restaurant in Pembroke, Massachusetts called 
Turner's Yard. One of his partners in the restaurant was National Hockey 
League player Shawn Thornton.[37] The restaurant is now closed.[38] Tim 
met his wife, Stacy Stover, in Massachusetts. They were married November 
9, 2002. Their two children are Trevor (born in 2004) and Brianna (2005).[39]
