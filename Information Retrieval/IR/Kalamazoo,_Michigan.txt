Kalamazoo /ˌkæləməˈzuː/ is a city in the southwest region of the U.S. state 
of Michigan. It is the county seat of Kalamazoo County. As of the 2010 
census, Kalamazoo had a total population of 74,262. Kalamazoo is the major 
city of the Kalamazoo-Portage Metropolitan Statistical Area, which has 
a population of 335,340 as of 2015.[6] Kalamazoo is equidistant from the 
major American cities of Chicago and Detroit, each fewer than 150 miles 
away. One of Kalamazoo's most notable features is the Kalamazoo Mall, an 
outdoor pedestrian shopping mall. The city created the mall in 1959 by 
closing part of Burdick Street to auto traffic, although two of the mall's 
four blocks have been reopened to auto traffic since 1999.[7][8] Kalamazoo 
is home to Western Michigan University, a large public university, Kalamazoo 
College, a liberal arts school, and Kalamazoo Valley Community College, 
a two-year community college. Originally known as Bronson (after founder 
Titus Bronson) in the township of Arcadia, the names of both the city and 
the township were changed to "Kalamazoo" in 1836 and 1837, respectively.[9] 
The Kalamazoo name comes from a Potawatomi word, first found in a British 
report in 1772. However, the Kalamazoo River, which passes through the 
modern city of Kalamazoo, was located on the route between Detroit and 
Fort Saint-Joseph (nowadays Niles, Michigan). French-Canadian traders, 
missionaries, and military personnel were quite familiar with this area 
during the French era and thereafter. The name for the Kalamazoo River 
was then known by Canadians and French as La rivière Kikanamaso. The name 
"Kikanamaso" was also recorded by Father Pierre Potier, a Jesuit missionary 
for the Huron-Wendats at the Assumption mission (south shore of Detroit), 
while en route to Fort Saint-Joseph during the fall of 1760.[10] Legend 
has it that "Ki-ka-ma-sung," meaning "boiling water," referring to a footrace 
held each fall by local Native Americans, who had to run to the river and 
back before the pot boiled.[11] Still another theory is that it means "the 
mirage or reflecting river."[12] Another legend is that the image of "boiling 
water" referred to fog on the river as seen from the hills above the current 
downtown. The name was also given to the river that flows almost all the 
way across the state. The name Kalamazoo, which sounds unusual to English-speaking 
ears, has become a metonym for exotic places, as in the phrase "from Timbuktu 
to Kalamazoo."[13] Today, T-shirts are sold in Kalamazoo with the phrase 
"Yes, there really is a Kalamazoo."[14] The area on which the modern city 
of Kalamazoo stands was once home to Native Americans of the Hopewell culture, 
who migrated into the area sometime before the first millennium. Evidence 
of their early residency remains in the form of a small mound in downtown's 
Bronson Park. The Hopewell civilization began to decline after the 8th 
century and was replaced by other groups.[15] The Potawatomi culture lived 
in the area when the first European explorers arrived. René-Robert Cavelier, 
Sieur de La Salle, passed just southeast of the present city of Kalamazoo 
in late March 1680. The first Europeans to reside in the area were itinerant 
fur traders in the late 18th and early 19th century. There are records 
of several traders wintering in the area, and by the 1820s at least one 
trading post had been established.[16][17] During the War of 1812, the 
British established a smithy and a prison camp in the area.[18] The 1821 
Treaty of Chicago ceded the territory south of the Grand River to the United 
States federal government. However, the area around present-day Kalamazoo 
was reserved as the village of Potawatomi Chief Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish. 
Six years later, as a result of the 1827 Treaty of St. Joseph, the tract 
that became the city of Kalamazoo was also ceded. In 1829, Titus Bronson, 
originally from Connecticut, became the first white settler to build a 
cabin within the present city limits of Kalamazoo.[19] He platted the town 
in 1831 and named it the village of Bronson—not to be confused with the 
much smaller Bronson, Michigan, about fifty miles (80 km) to the south-southeast 
of Kalamazoo. Bronson, frequently described as "eccentric" and argumentative, 
was later run out of town. The village was renamed Kalamazoo in 1836, due 
in part to Bronson's being fined for stealing a cherry tree.[20] Today, 
a hospital and a downtown park, among other things, are named for Bronson. 
Kalamazoo was legally incorporated as a village in 1838 and as a city in 
1883. The fertile farmlands attracted prosperous Yankee farmers who settled 
the surrounding area, and sent their sons to Kalamazoo to become businessmen, 
professionals and entrepreneurs who started numerous factories.[21] Most 
of the original settlers of Kalamazoo were New Englanders or were from 
upstate New York.[22] In the 1940s, the city became the first to install 
curb cuts.[citation needed] In 1959, the city created the Kalamazoo Mall, 
the first outdoor pedestrian shopping mall in the United States, by closing 
part of Burdick Street to auto traffic. The Mall was designed by Victor 
Gruen, who also designed the country's first enclosed shopping mall, which 
had opened three years earlier.[7] Two of the mall's four blocks were reopened 
to auto traffic in 1999 after much debate.[8] An F3 tornado struck downtown 
Kalamazoo on May 13, 1980, killing five and injuring 79.[23] On February 
20, 2016, Kalamazoo became the site of a random series of shootings in 
which six people were killed.[24] A prime suspect was apprehended by police 
without incident.[25] North Burdick St. in 1908 Academy St. in 1908 Old 
public library in 1908 Paper mills in 1908 In the past, Kalamazoo was known 
for its production of windmills, mandolins, buggies, automobiles, cigars, 
stoves, paper, and paper products. Agriculturally, it once was noted for 
celery. Although much of it has become suburbanized, the surrounding area 
still produces farm crops, primarily corn and soybeans. Kalamazoo was the 
original home of Gibson Guitar Corporation, which spawned the still-local 
Heritage Guitars. The company was incorporated as "Gibson Mandolin - Guitar 
Co., Ltd" on October 11, 1902, by the craftsman Orville Gibson. One budget 
model was named the Gibson Kalamazoo "Melody Maker" Electric Guitar. Operations 
were moved gradually from Kalamazoo to Memphis, Tennessee, (Electric Division) 
and Bozeman, Montana, (Acoustic Division) in the 1980s. Some workers from 
the original factory stayed in Kalamazoo to create the Heritage Guitar 
company.[27] Kalamazoo was once known as the "Paper City" because of the 
paper mills in and near the city. The Allied Paper Corporation operated 
several mills and employed 1,300 people in Kalamazoo during the late 1960s. 
As the forests of West Michigan were logged out, paper mills closed.[28][29] 
Early in the 20th century, Kalamazoo was home to the brass era automobile 
company Barley. Kalamazoo was also headquarters of the Checker Motors Company, 
the former manufacturer of the Checker Cab, which also stamped sheet metal 
parts for other auto manufacturers. Checker closed on June 25, 2009, a 
victim of the Late-2000s recession. Most of Kalamazoo is on the southwest 
bank of a major bend in the Kalamazoo River, with a small portion, about 
2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), on the opposite bank. Several small tributaries 
of the Kalamazoo River, including Arcadia Creek and Portage Creek, wind 
through the city. The northeastern portion of Kalamazoo sits in the broad, 
flat Kalamazoo Valley, while the western portions of Kalamazoo climb into 
low hills to the west and south. Several small lakes are found throughout 
the area. According to the United States Census Bureau, Kalamazoo has a 
total area of 25.11 square miles (65.03 km2), of which 24.68 square miles 
(63.92 km2) is land and 0.43 square miles (1.11 km2) is water.[1] Kalamazoo's 
suburban population is located primarily to the south, in the city of Portage, 
and to the west in Oshtemo and Texas townships. At least part of the municipal 
water supply for Kalamazoo is provided by the watershed contained within 
the Al Sabo Preserve[30] in Texas Charter Township, Michigan, immediately 
southwest of Kalamazoo. Another watershed, Kleinstuck Marsh,[31] is popular 
with hikers and birdwatchers. Kleinstuck Marsh is south of Maple Street, 
between Oakland Drive and Westnedge Avenue, Kalamazoo's major north-south 
artery. Kalamazoo has a humid continental (Köppen Dfa, but almost Dfb) 
climate. Summers can be hot, humid, and relatively long, comprising the 
months of May to September. Tornadoes are rare but possible in Kalamazoo. 
In winter, temperatures occasionally plummet below 0 °F (-18°). Kalamazoo 
has been known for brutal snow storms as late as early April, but there 
are occasional winter days with no snow cover on the ground at all. Lake-effect 
snowstorms are commonplace in the winter. As of 2000 the median income 
for a household in the city was $31,189, and the median income for a family 
was $42,438. Males had a median income of $32,160 versus $25,532 for females. 
The per capita income for the city was $16,897. About 13.6% of families 
and 24.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 26.0% 
of those under age 18 and 11.3% of those age 65 or over. As of the census[2] 
of 2010, there were 74,262 people, 29,141 households, and 13,453 families 
residing in the city. The population density was 3,009.0 inhabitants per 
square mile (1,161.8/km2). There were 32,433 housing units at an average 
density of 1,314.1 per square mile (507.4/km2). The racial makeup of the

Kalamazoo is commonly divided into 22 neighborhoods, many of which are 
served by a neighborhood association. The Neighborhood Development Division 
of the city's government works with these associations to invest federal, 
state, and local funds, including those from the Community Development 
Block Grant program, in community improvements and economic growth. In 
2007, Kalamazoo was named to Fast Company (magazine)'s 'Fast 50: Most Innovative 
Companies 2007',[33] in recognition of the city's Community Capitalism 
approach to revitalize the economy. In 2012 Kiplinger's Personal Finance 
ranked Kalamazoo fourth of the Ten Best Cities for Cheapskates.[34] The 
city was named in NerdWallet.com's 2014 'Top 10 Best Cities for Work-Life 
Balance'.[35][36] Kalamazoo has many local breweries and brewpubs that 
produce a variety of beer styles. Perhaps the best-known is Bell's Brewery, 
established as the Kalamazoo Brewing Company in 1985 by Larry Bell.[37] 
The brewery has expanded from its original Kalamazoo location, which houses 
the Eccentric Cafe, to another brewery in nearby Comstock. Bell's beer 
is sold by retailers across much of the country. Other local breweries 
include Tibb's Brewing Company,[38] Gonzo's BigDogg Brewery,[39] Rupert's 
Brewhouse,[40] Boatyard Brewing Co.,[41] One Well Brewing,[42] and Latitude 
42 Brewing Company, the latter in the southern suburb of Portage. In 2014, 
Battle Creek's Arcadia Brewing Company opened a new operation (brewhouse 
and pub)[43] in downtown Kalamazoo. On a smaller yet equally important 
scale are brewpubs Olde Peninsula Brewpub and Bravo! restaurant which serve 
their own brews. The area is also a hotbed for home brewing and partners 
with neighboring Grand Rapids to form what is widely considered one of 
America's more important regions in American craft beer explosion. In recent 
years, at least two community events have evolved from the growing craft 
beer industry in the Kalamazoo area (Kalamazoo Beer Week (annual),[44] 
Kalamazoo Craft Beer Festival[45]). In 2015, the Give a Craft beer trail 
and passport were introduced.[46] In 2015, Rupert's Brew House entered 
the Kalamazoo craft spirits market.[47] Two additional distilleries, Green 
Door Distilling, formerly Revival Distilling[48] and Kalamazoo Distilling 
Company, are in the licensing stage.[49] The A.M. Todd Company, one of 
the lead producers of peppermint oil and other flavorings, is headquartered 
in Kalamazoo.[50] Its founder, Albert M. Todd, was elected to the United 
States House of Representatives for the 55th Congress. Kalamazoo is also 
home to Kalsec, another flavorings company, which was founded by Paul H. 
Todd, Jr., Albert Todd's grandson and U.S. Representative in the 89th Congress. 
Founded as the Kalamazoo Spice Extraction Company, Kalsec is owned and 
managed by Todd family descendants.[51] The Upjohn Company was a pharmaceutical 
manufacturing firm founded in 1886 in Kalamazoo that is now part of the 
Pfizer Corporation. Most of Upjohn's original facilities remain, many have 
been renovated and some new buildings have been constructed. The bulk of 
the facilities exist in Portage, Michigan, but many also exist in Downtown 
Kalamazoo. Western Michigan University School of Medicine (WMed) is a collaboration 
involving Western Michigan University and Kalamazoo's two teaching hospitals, 
Borgess Health[59] and Bronson Healthcare. The new medical school has been 
in planning since 2008, and was granted Preliminary Accreditation from 
the Liaison Committee on Medical Education in October 2012. Welcoming its 
first class in August 2014, the school is a private 501(c)(3) nonprofit 
corporation supported by private gifts, clinical revenue, research activity, 
student tuition, and endowment income. In March 2011, Western Michigan 
University received a gift of $100 million for the medical school from 
anonymous donors. The global Research and Development organization of Zoetis, 
the world's largest producer of medicine and vaccinations for pets and 
livestock, is headquartered in downtown Kalamazoo.[60] The city is also

Forms, Inc., received five National Design Awards.[64] The W. E. Upjohn 
Institute for Employment Research, a nonpartisan, not-for-profit research 
organization, has operated in Kalamazoo since its establishment in 1945. 
The Institute conducts research into the causes and effects of unemployment, 
and measures for the alleviation of unemployment. The Institute also publishes 
Business Outlook for West Michigan,[65] a quarterly journal that provides 
economic analysis and forecasts on the West Michigan economy. The Fetzer 
Institute promotes and funds holistic solutions to everyday problems.[66] 
It was founded by John Fetzer, a broadcasting magnate and former owner 
of the Detroit Tigers and WKZO radio and television in Kalamazoo.[67] The 
economic development organization Southwest Michigan First was established 
in Kalamazoo in 1999, with a focus on Community Capitalism.[68] The organization 
was recognized as a Best and Brightest Company to Work For[69] in 2013,[70] 
and has received Fast Company (magazine) commendations for innovative strategies 
to improve the economy.[71] In 2015, two members of Southwest Michigan 
First were selected for Development Counsellors International's "2015 40 
under 40," top 40 young economic developers in the United States.[72] Other 
notable Kalamazoo businesses include: Kalamazoo government is administered 
under a Commission-Manager style of government. The City Commission is 
the representative body of the city, and consists of seven members, elected 
on a non-partisan basis every two years. Whoever receives the most votes 
during an election becomes the council president and ceremonial mayor of 
the city. The member that receives the second highest number of votes becomes 
vice mayor.[74] The current mayor, Bobby J. Hopewell, was elected November 
13, 2007, beating Hannah McKinney, who automatically became vice mayor.[75] 
In the November 3, 2009, and November 8, 2011, elections voters returned 
Hopewell as mayor and McKinney as vice-mayor. The City Manager is the city's 
chief administrative officer. The manager is hired by, and answers to, 
the City Commission. Kalamazoo has a higher crime rate than the national 
average. Crime is spread throughout Kalamazoo and is especially high in 
the inner neighborhoods of Edison, the Northside and Vine. Crime is lower 
in the downtown and certain outer neighborhoods.[76] The aggravated assault 
rate in 2015 was 793.3 per 100,000[77] - 3.3 times the national average. 
The murder rate was 12.5 per 100,000 in 2010 and 7.9 per 100,000 in 2014.[78][79] 
The 2016 Kalamazoo shootings by Jason Dalton claimed 6 lives and caused 
2 serious injuries in Kalamazoo County. Kalamazoo is home to Western Michigan 
University. The college has four campuses in Kalamazoo, (West Campus, East

Business Review Western Michigan, a business-to-business publication headquartered 
in Kalamazoo, covering Western Michigan news, was rolled into MLive online 
coverage in late 2012. The ultimate parent company of both the Gazette 
and Business Review are Advance Publications, Inc. WWMT, West Michigan's 
CBS / CW affiliate, is licensed and operates out of Kalamazoo but serves 
the entire West Michigan region. The station was originally owned and operated 
by famous broadcasting pioneer (and former Detroit Tigers owner) John Fetzer, 
as "WKZO-TV". Along with television, Fetzer introduced Kalamazoo to radio 
in 1931, when AM 590 WKZO signed on the air. Fezter also created Kalamazoo's 
first cable television system, then known as Fetzer Cable; it is a predecessor 
of Kalamazoo's current cable franchise, Charter Communications. The Public 
Media Network, located in downtown Kalamazoo, hosts media outlets including 
Charter cable channels 19, 20, 21, 22, and 95 where daily public access 
programs are produced and aired to the public. Kalamazoo is part of the 
West Michigan television market, which also includes Grand Rapids and Battle 
Creek. Most channels that serve the entire market are receivable in Kalamazoo, 
including WWMT, WOOD-TV (NBC), WXMI (Fox), WZPX (Ion) and WLLA (religious). 
Some channels based in the northern part of the market reach Kalamazoo 
through a satellite or translator, such as WTLJ Muskegon (religious, through 
W26BX), WGVU-TV Grand Rapids (PBS, through WGVK), and WXSP-CD Grand Rapids 
(MyNetworkTV, through WOKZ-CA). WOTV in Battle Creek broadcasts ABC programming 
for the southern part of the market, including Kalamazoo. Charter offers 
all West Michigan channels on its system to Kalamazoo subscribers, including 
WZZM, the ABC affiliate for Grand Rapids and the northern part of the market. 
WIDR is the college student-run, commercial free radio station at Western 
Michigan University. It is known for playing obscure and rarely heard underground 
music of all styles as well as some local news and talk. Broadcasting 100 
watts on 89.1 FM, WIDR can be heard from about a 20-mile radius from campus.

music programs including jazz and classical performances as well as programming 
from NPR. WMUK broadcasts 50,000 watts in high definition on 102.1 FM. 
WKDS is West Michigan's only high school student-run radio station. The 
station signed on in 1983 at 89.9 on the FM dial, broadcasting from Loy 
Norrix High School. The call letters stood for Kalamazoo District Schools 
(now Kalamazoo Public Schools). For most of its history, WKDS broadcast 
only during daytime hours and not at all on the weekend. In Fall of 2004, 
the station began broadcasting 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in an attempt 
to prevent an outside organization to take over the time WKDS was off the 
air. WKDS was part of a county wide Education For Employment program for 
years. The radio station is still owned by Kalamazoo Public Schools although 
the EFE program has been discontinued. High School students from around 
the area continue to operate the station. FM radio stations which serve 
Kalamazoo include: AM radio stations which serve Kalamazoo include: Radio 
stations from Battle Creek, Grand Rapids and Lansing are also heard in 
Kalamazoo. Kalamazoo is served by highways I-94, US 131, M-43 and M-96. 
It was on the original Territorial Road in Michigan of the 19th century, 
which started in Detroit and ran to Lake Michigan. Much of that, but not 
all, later became Old US 12—the "old" designation came about when I-94 
was built parallel to it—and also was called Red Arrow Highway after a 
World War I army division. The name "US 12" was shifted south to what once 
was US 112 between Detroit and New Buffalo . Some parts of Old US 12 outside 
of town, especially in Van Buren and Berrien counties to the west, are 
still called Red Arrow Highway. The term "Old US 12" has faded from use. 
The Kal-Haven Trail, heavily used by cyclists, runners, walkers, and snowmobilers, 
extends to downtown Kalamazoo. It runs 34 miles (55 km) between South Haven, 
Michigan, to a trailhead just west of Kalamazoo. Between that trailhead 
and South Haven the trail is run by Van Buren County, even the parts within 
Kalamazoo County. A trail pass is no longer required. The Kal-Haven is 
a rail trail, built on the former right-of-way of the Kalamazoo and South 
Haven Railroad. The section east of the trailhead was opened in 2008 and 
extends to downtown Kalamazoo. It's known as the Kalamazoo River Valley 
Trail and is run by Kalamazoo County. No pass is required on that section. 
Kalamazoo's name is a familiar reference in popular music, since its exotic 
sound makes it a "great word for a lyric".[110] Its use as metonym for 
a remote place is discussed above — "although when it comes to both Timbuktu 
and Kalamazoo, most of that brag-worthy exotic allure is merely in their 
names."[13] Nonetheless, numerous songs use the city's name in their song 
title or lyrics. Probably the most famous and first was (I've Got a Gal 
In) Kalamazoo" (1942) by the Glenn Miller band with Tex Beneke. This #1 
popular song was written by Mack Gordon and Harry Warren. The performance 
was recreated with Gene Morrison Orchestra as the Glenn Miller Band and 
the Nicholas Brothers (doing a memorable dance) in the 1942 movie Orchestra 
Wives.[111][112] This was nominated: Best Music, Original Song in Academy 
Awards) Harry Warren (music), Mack Gordon (lyrics).[112][113] See 15th 
Academy Awards. At least a dozen (and many more versions) of "Kalamazoo" 
songs have been recorded. In chronological order others include: "I've 
Been Everywhere" by Hank Snow (1962) (album of the same title)[114] and 
Johnny Cash (1996) Unchained[115] — reworked from the original 1959 Geoff 
Mack Australian-place-names version made popular by the singer Lucky Starr; 
"Down on the Corner" (1969) by Creedence Clearwater Revival on their fourth 
studio album, Willy and the Poor Boys — covered by a dozen other groups 
– though the reference is not to the city but to one of the "Kalamazoo" 
line of budget priced guitars manufactured by Gibson;[116] "Kalamazoo" 
(1995) by Luna on Penthouse;[117] "Cold Rock a Party" (1997) by MC Lyte 
on Bad As I Wanna B;[118] "Kalamazoo" a song by the rock trio Primus on 
the 1997 Brown Album';[119] "Top of the World" by Rascalz (1999) on Global 
Warning;[120] "Kalamazoo", a song by Ben Folds on the 2004 EP Super D;[121][122][123] 
and "Kalamazoo" (2009) by Mike Craver on his album Shining Down.[124] The 
city was also mentioned in the chorus of the song "Gotta Get Away" by The 
Black Keys, from their album Turn Blue ("I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo/Just 
to get away from you...").[125] Like Miller, the Creedence and Axton lyrics 
probably use the word "Kalamazoo" as an oblique reference to Gibson Guitars, 
which made various models named "Kalamazoo", all prominently adorned with 
the city's name as their origin. Rapper Young Jeezy also referenced the 
city in the song "Higher Learning" on his third album "TM103:Hustlerz Ambition".[110][126] 
The "Kalamazoo" was one of several names of a railroad Handcar, and was 
produced by the Kalamazoo Manufacturing Company.[127] Sophie's family in 
Magic in the Moonlight came from Kalamazoo, Michigan.[citation needed]
