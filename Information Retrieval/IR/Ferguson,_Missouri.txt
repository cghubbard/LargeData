Ferguson is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States.[1] It 
is part of the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area. The population was 
21,203 at the 2010 census.[6] What is now the city of Ferguson was founded 
in 1855 when William B. Ferguson deeded 10 acres (4.0 ha) of land to the 
Wabash Railroad in exchange for a new depot and naming rights.[7][8] The 
settlement that sprang up around the depot was called Ferguson Station.[9] 
Ferguson was the first railroad station connected directly to St. Louis.[10] 
The station is a focal point of the city's history and is depicted on the 
city flag, designed in 1994.[11][12] Ferguson's first schoolhouse was built 
in 1878. Ferguson was incorporated as a city in 1894.[13] Emerson Electric 
moved its headquarters to Ferguson during the 20th century.[9] On August 
9, 2014, an 18-year-old African-American man, Michael Brown, was fatally 
shot by Darren Wilson, a white policeman with the Ferguson Police Department.[14][15] 
The incident sparked protests and acts of vandalism in Ferguson as well 
as widespread calls for an investigation into the incident.[16] On August 
10, after a day of vigils, there were looting of businesses, vandalism 
of vehicles, and violent clashes between protestors and police.[17][18][19] 
On August 18, soldiers from the Missouri National Guard arrived in Ferguson 
at the request of the Governor of Missouri Jay Nixon, who also ended midnight 
to 5:00 a.m. curfews that had been imposed.[20] On November 24, a grand 
jury decided that it would not indict Wilson in the shooting death of Brown.[21] 
Following the announcement of the grand jury's decision, there were peaceful 
protests as well as rioting.[22][23] According to the United States Census 
Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.20 square miles (16.06 km2), of 
which 6.19 square miles (16.03 km2) is land and 0.01 square miles (0.03 km2) 
is water.[3] Ferguson has a humid subtropical-continental climate. Winters 
are cold, while summers are hot and humid. The record high is 115 °F, and 
the record low is −19 °F. The population of Ferguson grew rapidly during 
the late nineteenth century. In 1880 the population of the then Ferguson 
Station was 185 people. By 1890 the population was recorded as being 750 
and only four years later it had increased to 1200.[26] The population 
of Ferguson continued to grow rapidly during the first six decades of the 
twentieth century, from 1,015 people in 1900 to 22,149 people in 1960, 
an average growth rate of 5% per year. Since 1960 the population has remained 
nearly constant. The ethnic composition of Ferguson has shifted, however. 
In 1970, 99% of the population of Ferguson was white and 1% Black. In 1980, 
the proportion of White residents went down to 85%, whereas the proportion 
of Black rose to 14%. In 1990, residents of Ferguson who were identified 
in the U.S. Census as white comprised 73.8% of the total, while those identified 
as black made up 25.1%.[27] (The remainder, 1.1%, identified with other 
racial categories.) In the 2000 census, 44.7% were white and 52.4% were 
African-American, now the majority ethnicity.[28] A recent investigation 
found that the Ferguson Police Department had outstanding arrest warrants 
for more than two thirds of the citizens, mostly for trivial offenses.[29]

a two-station firehouse with a complement of 18 full time firefighters 
as well as 9 senior management officials.[36] The fire stations operate 
24 hours a day.[36] On March 4, 2015, the Ferguson Police Department was 
criticized by the United States Department of Justice for civil rights 
violations. The Department of Justice argued that the Ferguson Police Department 
and the City of Ferguson relied on unconstitutional practices in order 
to balance the city's budget through racially-motivated excessive fines 
and punishments.[37] On Wednesday, March 11, 2015, Ferguson Police Chief 
Thomas Jackson stated he is willing to resign, likely later that day (though 
no timeframe was confirmed) if he can get assurances that the Ferguson 
Police Department will be left in place and will not be dissolved; Fox 
News said he was not pushed out or fired. His resignation followed City 
Manager John Shaw who resigned March 10, and Municipal Judge Ronald Brockmeyer 
who resigned March 9. Shaw had ultimate oversight over the Police Department 
and other city departments and was the most powerful civic official in 
Ferguson. He faced criticism for not doing enough to ameliorate the situation. 
The week before, three Ferguson Police Department employees were fired 
for offensive emails mentioned in the Justice Department report.[38] St.
