As player As manager Edmund Walter Lopat (originally Lopatynski) (June 
21, 1918 – June 15, 1992) was a Major League Baseball pitcher, coach, manager, 
front office executive, and scout. He was sometimes known as "The Junk 
Man", but better known as "Steady Eddie", a nickname later given to Eddie 
Murray. He was born in New York City. A left-hander, Lopat made his Major 
League pitching debut on April 30, 1944, playing for the Chicago White 
Sox. He was traded to the New York Yankees on February 24, 1948 for Aaron 
Robinson, Bill Wight, and Fred Bradley. From 1948 to 1953 he was the third 
of the "Big Three" of the Yankees' pitching staff, together with Allie 
Reynolds and Vic Raschi. He pitched in the All-Star Game in 1951 for the 
American League. In 1953 he led the AL in both earned-run average and won/lost 
percentage. On July 30, 1955, he was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for 
Jim McDonald and cash, finishing out the season and retiring. Over his 
12-year AL career, Lopat won 166 games, losing 112 (.597) with an ERA of 
3.21. Lopat managed the Triple-A Richmond Virginians for the Yankees from 
1956–58, then became a roving pitching coach in the Bombers' farm system 
in 1959. In 1960, he served one season the Yankees' MLB pitching coach, 
Casey Stengel's final campaign as the club's manager, which produced an 
American League pennant but a defeat at the hands of the Pittsburgh Pirates 
in the World Series. Lopat was not rehired by Stengel's successor, Ralph 
Houk, but he stayed in the league as pitching coach of the Minnesota Twins 
in 1961 and the Kansas City Athletics in 1962. In 1963 Lopat was tapped 
to manage the Athletics and continued in this role until June 11, 1964.[1] 
His 1963 squad finished in eighth place, registering one more victory than 
it had in 1962. But his 1964 A's were playing only .327 baseball at 17–35 
when he was replaced by Mel McGaha. His final Major League managerial record 
was 90–124 (.421). Lopat remained with the Athletics as a senior front 
office aide to team owner Charlie Finley until the club moved to Oakland 
after the 1967 season. He then scouted for the Montreal Expos during their 
early years in Major League Baseball. In 1978, Eddie Lopat was inducted 
into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame [2] He died at his 
son's home in Darien, Connecticut, on June 15, 1992.[3] Lopat pitched for 
five victorious Yankees teams in the World Series during his career, in
