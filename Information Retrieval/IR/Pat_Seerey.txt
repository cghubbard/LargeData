James Patrick Seerey (March 17, 1923 – April 28, 1986) was an American 
professional baseball player. An outfielder, Seerey played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) for seven seasons in the American League with the Cleveland 
Indians and Chicago White Sox. In 561 career games, Seerey recorded a batting 
average of .224 and accumulated 86 home runs and 261 runs batted in (RBI). 
Born in Oklahoma and raised in Arkansas, Seerey played football and baseball 
in high school. After graduating, he joined the Cleveland Indians' farm 
system in 1941, and made his major league debut two-and-a-half years later. 
He was primary a starting outfielder the next five seasons for the Indians, 
but led the league in strikeouts four times. He was traded partway through 
the 1948 season to the Chicago White Sox, and a month after being traded 
became one of 16 MLB players to hit four home runs in one game. The following 
season, he was sent to the minor leagues, and played a few seasons in the 
farm system for the White Sox before retiring. Pat Seerey was born in Wilburton, 
Oklahoma in 1923 to James and Marie Seerey. His family moved to Little 
Rock, Arkansas when he was a child, and he played baseball for the Little 
Rock Boys' Club at Lamar Porter Field.[1] He attended Little Rock Catholic 
High School, where he played baseball and American football, serving as 
the team's starting fullback.[2] After graduating from high school in 1941, 
he was signed by the Cleveland Indians. Shortly afterwards, he was classified 
as 4-F, meaning he would not be lost to the military during World War II.[3] 
Seerey started his minor league baseball career in 1941 with the Appleton 
Papermakers of the Wisconsin State League. In one of his first appearances 
for the team, he hit for the cycle in a 15–4 victory against the Fond du 
Lac Panthers.[4] In 104 games for Appleton that year, Seerey had a .330 
batting average with 31 home runs and 117 runs batted in; the 31 home runs 
were a record for the Wisconsin State League at the time.[5] The following 
season, Seerey played for the Cedar Rapids Raiders of the Three-I League. 
In 117 games for the Raiders, he had a .303 batting average and 33 home 
runs. In 1943, Seerey was promoted to the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Eastern 
League, and played in 31 games over the first two months of the season.[6] 
In early June, outfielder Hank Edwards broke his collarbone, and the Indians 
needed an extra outfielder on the roster; Seerey was promoted as a result.[3] 
Seerey made his debut with the Indians on June 9, 1943. Almost immediately 
after his debut, he earned the nickname of "people's choice" in media due 
to both his hitting ability and his "willingness to challenge the brick 
walls of the stadium".[7] He played in 26 games for the Indians on the 
season, and hit .222 in 72 at-bats.[8] Entering the 1944 Cleveland Indians 
season, manager Lou Boudreau planned to use Seerey as the starting center 
fielder, as he had reported to spring training 25 pounds lighter and Boudreau 
felt that Seerey could improve on a weak area on the team's roster.[9] 
Seerey moved back to left field to begin the season; in his first game 
there on the year, he hit a three-run home run to give the Indians a 7–4 
victory over the Detroit Tigers.[10] A month into the season, Seerey was 
among the league leaders in runs batted in, which was attributed to better 
plate discipline, though his fielding in the outfield was still considered 
a liability.[11] Partway through the season, Seerey's playing time diminished, 
yet he remained the team leader in home runs for most of the season despite 
limited at-bats.[12] He finished the season with 15 home runs, 39 runs 
batted in, and a league-leading 99 strikeouts in 101 games.[8] Entering 
the 1945 Cleveland Indians season, Seerey was re-classified as 1-A, and 
took a military examination during the offseason.[13] He was not slated 
to join the military after the exam, and the season started with him on 
the roster as one of the team's starting three outfielders, thanks in part 
to getting in shape after a strict diet during the offseason.[14] He started 
off with hits in the first seven games of the season.[15] A month into 
the season, Seerey hit his first two home runs of the season in a 7–3 loss 
to the New York Yankees.[16] He followed that up in a mid-July game against 
the Yankees with three home runs and eight runs batted in, becoming the 
fourth Indians player to hit three home runs in a game in a 16–4 Indians 
win.[17] He spent the second half of the season in and out of the starting 
lineup due to his inconsistent hitting; manager Boudreau felt that occasional 
rest days would increase his consistency.[18] In a career-high 126 games, 
Seerey hit .236 with 14 home runs and 97 strikeouts, which again led the 
league.[8] After getting married in early 1946 to Jeanne Dillinger,[19] 
Seerey started the 1946 Cleveland Indians season working with Boudreau 
to fix his hitting, as his lunge when he swung the bat was causing him 
to strike out too often and not hit enough home runs.[20] The change worked, 
as by the start of July Seerey had a team-leading 11 home runs.[21] His 
second half performance included a doubleheader against the Chicago White 
Sox where he hit a home run in each game; the second home run landed in 
the upper deck of Cleveland Municipal Stadium, a feat that at the time 
had only been matched by fellow Indians outfielder Jeff Heath.[22] He finished 
the season with a .225 batting average, 26 home runs, 62 RBIs, and 101 
strikeouts. The 26 home runs were fourth in the league, and for the third 
straight year Seerey led the league in strikeouts.[8] Indians catcher Jim 
Hegan and Seerey spent the offseason improving their hitting, attending 
batting school led by Hall of Famer Rogers Hornsby; Hornsby concentrated 
primarily on improving Seerey's timing to help him to hit the ball more 
frequently.[23] In spring training games, Seerey had nine home runs, and 
expectations were high for him; Boudreau gave him the starting job in left 
field for the opener against the White Sox.[24] Through the first month 
of the season, Seerey had six home runs, but his performance worsened as 
the season went on. At the end of June, Seerey was removed from the starting 
lineup and replaced by both Dale Mitchell and Hank Edwards; he spent the 
rest of the season playing part-time.[25] He finished the season with a 
.171 batting average and 11 home runs in 82 games.[6] After the 1947 season 
ended, Indians owner Bill Veeck put Seerey on a strict diet and exercise 
regimen for the offseason, stating that he had to lose 35 pounds if he 
wanted to remain on the team.[26] By the start of spring training, he had 
reached his goal of 195 pounds, and felt like he had an easier time swinging 
the baseball bat as a result.[19] After a good month of spring training, 
Boudreau named him the starter in right field for the 1948 season, saying 
that "he'll be in there until he stops hitting."[27] Shortly afterwards, 
Seerey was removed from the starting lineup, and he ended up playing 10 
games for the Indians before being traded. On June 2, Seerey was traded 
with Al Gettel to the White Sox for Bob Kennedy due to his inconsistency 
as well as an overstocked group of outfielders on the roster.[28] Seerey 
was named the starting left fielder upon joining the White Sox, a position 
he held the rest of the season. Through his first 12 games, Seerey had 
16 RBIs.[29] On July 18, Seerey made history, becoming the fifth player 
to hit four home runs in one game, doing so in an 11-inning, 12–11 win 
over the Philadelphia Athletics. Seerey homered in three successive innings 
(fourth through sixth), hitting his first two off starting pitcher Carl 
Scheib and the third off reliever Bob Savage. His fourth home run, in the 
11th off Lou Brissie, gave the White Sox the win. On that day, Seerey went 
4-for-6 with seven runs batted in.[30] In 105 games, 95 with the White 
Sox, Seerey had a .231 batting average, 19 home runs, 70 RBIs, and 102 
strikeouts; he led the league in strikeouts for the fourth time.[8] The 
White Sox brought on new manager Jack Onslow to begin the 1949 Chicago 
White Sox season. He had a problem with Seerey, who arrived overweight 
to spring training, and did not consider him worthy of practicing with 
the other players until he got the weight back down.[31] After playing 
in four games for the Sox, his last coming on May 7, Seerey was sent to 
the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, ending his major league 
career.[32] He played for four minor league teams in 1949: Los Angeles, 
the Newark Bears, the Kansas City Blues, and the San Antonio Missions.[6] 
Seerey spent 1950 with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Western League. 
Partway through the season, he broke the league's home run record of 30, 
and went on to hit 44 for the Sky Sox over the course of the season.[33] 
He then finished the season with the Memphis Chickasaws, playing 136 total 
games with both teams.[6] Seerey split most of the 1951 season between 
Memphis and Colorado Springs. In one game with the Sky Sox in June, Seerey 
had two grand slams and nine RBIs in a game, both league records at the 
time.[34] He ended the season with the Tampa Smokers, and had 28 home runs 
in 113 between the three teams.[6] In 1952, Seerey joined a semi-professional 
baseball team in Guelph, Ontario. With them, he had 11 home runs and a 
.253 batting average, and retired at season's end. The 11 home runs were 
the highest in the league that season.[35] After retiring, Seerey became 
a janitor in the St. Louis public school system.[36] He died in Jennings,
