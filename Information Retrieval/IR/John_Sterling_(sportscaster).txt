John Sterling (born John Sloss;[1] July 4, 1938[2])[3] is an American sportscaster 
best known as the radio play-by-play announcer of Major League Baseball's 
New York Yankees. He has announced every Yankees game since 1989.[4][5] 
Sterling grew up on Manhattan's Upper East Side, in the East 80s.[6] He 
was the son of advertising executive Carl H.T. and Gladys (Hodrov) Sloss. 
According to the 1940 U.S. Census, John was one year old and living with 
the family in Manhattan when the census was taken on April 4.[2] He briefly 
attended Moravian College, Boston University, and the Columbia University 
School of General Studies before leaving school to begin his career in 
radio at a small station in Wellsville, New York.[7] Sterling began his 
broadcasting career in Baltimore, where he served as the play-by-play announcer 
for the then-Baltimore Bullets for the 1970–71 NBA season. He also did 
play-by-play for Morgan State University football, a role that he held 
from 1971 to 1978. Sterling came to New York broadcasting as a talk show 
host with WMCA in 1971. He later served as the radio voice for the WHA's 
New York Raiders, the WFL's New York Stars, the NHL's New York Islanders 
(where he was paired with Bob Lawrence), and the ABA/NBA's New York/New 
Jersey Nets (where he was paired mainly with Mike DeTomasso). Sterling 
also did a stretch with the Yankees as pre-game host on WMCA and WINS radio, 
as well as co-host on cable segments with Mel Allen.[5] From 1975 through 
1980, Sterling announced Nets and Islanders games for WMCA, WVNJ, WOR-TV, 
and SportsChannel New York, continuing his WMCA talk program until 1978.[5] 
After his initial stint in New York, Sterling spent nine years in Atlanta 
hosting a sports call-in show on WSB radio and covering the Braves (1982–1987) 
and Hawks (1981–1989) for Turner Sports.[5] In 1989, Sterling returned 
to New York to broadcast the games for the Yankees on WABC radio. He has 
been with the Yankees ever since, currently calling games on WFAN radio 
and its affiliates in the New York Yankees Radio Network. Since 2005, he 
has been paired with Suzyn Waldman; past announcing partners include: Jay 
Johnstone (1989–1990), Joe Angel (1991), Michael Kay (1992–2001), and Charley 
Steiner (2002–2004).[5] In 2013, the Yankees announced a move to WFAN over 
the next ten years, and Sterling was retained.[8] His contract was extended 
through the 2017 season on February 12, 2016. Sterling's association with 
the Yankees is not limited to announcing live games over the radio. He 
is also host of the YES Network's Yankeeography series, which produces 
biographies of New York Yankees. Among several nominations, Sterling has 
received two Emmy Awards for the series.[9] He also hosts the introductions 
and recaps for Yankees Classics. In addition, Sterling has a nightly commentary 
feature on WCBS-TV newscasts called "Sterling on Sports", in which he gives 
his take on a recent sporting event or sports news item.[10] This commentary 
airs nightly during the 6:15 PM sports report. Sterling and former broadcasting 
partner Michael Kay commonly work together representing the Yankees. They 
announce the annual Yankees' Old-Timers' Day.[11] They have presided at 
the "Key to the City" ceremonies following Yankee World Series victories 
in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2009. The pair often serve as masters of 
ceremonies on and off the field for major Yankee events, including the 
2000 ticker-tape parade held in the Yankees' honor after their World Series 
win.[12][13] Sterling has emceed several Yankees pre-game ceremonies including 
the number retirements of Jorge Posada, Andy Pettitte, Bernie Williams, 
Tino Martinez, Joe Torre, Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera's number retirement 
in 2013 and Monument Park induction (2016), and the 20th anniversary of 
the Yankees' 1996 World Series victory in 2016. Sterling has several idiosyncrasies 
that mark his broadcasts as distinctive, very unusual, if also divisive.[14] 
In addition to a colorful vocal personality, Sterling has distinguished 
himself for sometimes characterizing plays differently than they may appear 
and for his announcing errors, habits that spark high feelings in fans 
and lead to comparisons with announcers like Phil Rizzuto. [15][16] Following 
the final out of a Yankees victory, Sterling calls "Ballgame over! Yankees 
win! Theeeeeee Yankees win!"[5][14] The length of the word "the" is held 
longer after dramatic victories, as well as after victories resulting in 
championships (which Sterling also punctuates by saying the name of whichever 
series is over). It has been played over the public address system at Yankee 
Stadium after every Yankees victory for the past several seasons, right 
before Frank Sinatra's cover of "Theme from New York, New York" is played.[17] 
The phrase evolved from Sterling's call of Mel Hall's game-winning three-run 
homer in the ninth inning on May 27, 1991, to give the Yankees a dramatic 
Memorial Day win over the Boston Red Sox.[18] One of his signature radio 
remarks is his home run call "It is high, it is far, it is gone!"[19] He 
devises a personalized catchphrase for every Yankee player.[20] Sterling 
is known for giving each player a personalized home run call.[21] For back 
to back home runs, especially homers from opposite sides of the plate, 
Sterling references Harry Belafonte's "Zombie Jamboree" by saying "it's 
a back to back! ... and a belly to belly!" In addition, sometimes before 
a pitch he will say "theeeeeee pitch", lengthening the word the. If a batter 
swings and misses, Sterling will often say "cuuuuut on-and-missed", elongating 
the word cut, followed by on-n-miss pronounced as one quick word. After 
a strikeout swinging, he says "STRUCK HIM OUT SWINGING!", and for a strikeout 
looking he calls "STRIIIIKE THREE!", elongating the 'I' in strike. In all 
cases when Sterling emphasizes the word "the", as is one of his signatures, 
he uses not the long ē ("thee") but the schwa ə ("thuh"). Sterling is heavily 
criticized in the media, with over 100 websites dedicated to denigrating 
his style and calls.[22] Many baseball writers and websites have ranked 
him the worst or close to the worst of current baseball radio announcers.[23][24] 
Much of the criticism stems from calling balls home runs that are not home 
runs, mixing up fair and foul balls, and his personalized home run calls, 
which some people view as "over-the-top" or "too much".[25] Regularly criticized 
by Craig Carton and Phil Mushnick for his inaccurate calls,[26] Mushnick 
has called him a "dishonest, self-promoting clown".[27] He has also been 
heavily criticized for making the call of the game more about himself than 
the play on the field[28] with over the top excitement for routine plays 
or insignificant events.[29] Many of his critics further accuse him of 
blaming someone or something else for his confusion.[30] He has also been 
consistently rated one of the most biased sportcasters in the industry[31][32] 
The New York Times has described John Sterling as "frequently awful and 
laughable", often miscalling plays or not describing a play accurately 
– blaming confusion on the field or other reasons. This is in despite of 
the fact that other announcers called the same play with complete accuracy 
for television or the opponents broadcast.[33] The New York Daily News 
was also critical of Sterling's domineering of the booth, whereas most 
teams employ a two-man booth where duties are shared, Sterling does 100% 
of all play-by-play with his partner, Suzyn Waldman limited to ancillary 
commentary.[34] Jim Norton of The Opie and Anthony Show routinely mocks 
Sterling's player nicknames and his emphasis on the "mmm" sound before 
saying "mmm-it is high, mmm-it is far. ..."[35] Sterling is a resident 
of Edgewater, New Jersey.[36] He had previously resided in Teaneck, New 
Jersey.[37] He was divorced in 2008 after 12 years of marriage to wife, 
Jennifer[6] and is the father of four, including a set of triplets, born 
in 2000.[5] In January 2015, fire destroyed the Avalon at Edgewater complex 
building. Sterling was one of hundreds of displaced residents.[38][39]
