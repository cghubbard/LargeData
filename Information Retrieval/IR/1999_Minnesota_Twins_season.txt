The 1999 Minnesota Twins began their season on a positive note, with Brad 
Radke getting the win in a 6-1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. Unfortunately 
for the Twins, the team finished the season in last place, with a poor 
record of 63-97. Seventeen rookies saw playing time for manager Tom Kelly 
in the 1999 season. Some of these rookies, such as Corey Koskie, Torii 
Hunter, and Joe Mays, would go on to future success. The season was not 
without its bright spots, including Doug Mientkiewicz's .997 fielding percentage 
and Koskie's team-leading .310 batting average. Another bright spot occurred 
on September 11, when pitcher Eric Milton threw the only no-hitter of his 
career against an Anaheim Angels team that consisted mainly of September 
call-ups. However, the euphemism "rebuilding year" must be applied to the 
Twins’ 1999 campaign. On May 4, rookie Mike Lincoln pitched the Twins to 
their 3,000th victory. It was Lincoln's first win in the major leagues, 
as he beat the Yankees 8-5 at the Metrodome. Bert Blyleven was on the mound 
for both the Twins' 1,000th and 2,000th victories. It was only May 21 when 
the team's brain trust realized that this would not be a world champion 
team. On that day, the Twins traded Rick Aguilera, then their highest paid 
player, to the Chicago Cubs. The team also traded Scott Downs and received 
Jason Ryan and future starter Kyle Lohse in return. The team finished the 
season with a 63-97 record, ranked fifth in the American League Central 
Division. The lone representative of the Twins in the All-Star Game was 
Ron Coomer. He replaced Jim Thome at first base and went 0 for 1. The highest 
paid Twin in 1999 was Rick Aguilera at $4,300,000; followed by Marty Cordova 
at $3,000,000. The offense was not impressive. Minnesota was last in the 
league in slugging and had only one more walk than the league-worst White 
Sox. The team leaders were: Coomer with 16 home runs; Cordova with 70 RBI; 
Koskie with a .310 average; Walker with 148 hits and 37 doubles; and Lawton 
with 26 stolen bases. Several players failed to meet expectations offensively. 
In June, Lawton was hit in the face by a pitch. He missed a month and had 
trouble finding his swing after returning. Mientkiewicz had a great season 
batting-wise at the double-A level in 1998, but was not able to follow 
it up the following year at the major league level. Radke, Milton, and 
LaTroy Hawkins filled the first three spots in the starting rotation throughout 
the season. The fourth and fifth spots were less predictable. Mays did 
emerge as a capable starter midway through the season, making 20 starts. 
Also making an appreciable number of starts in 1999 were Mike Lincoln (15), 
Dan Perkins (12), and Jason Ryan (8). Aguilera started the season as the 
Twins’ closer and recorded eight saves, but Mike Trombley took over the 
closer duties in May and finished the season with 24 saves. Trombley, Bob 
Wells, Travis Miller, Eddie Guardado, and Héctor Carrasco had respectable 
seasons out of the bullpen. Overall, the pitching staff allowed the second 
fewest walks in the American League and had an average ERA. Like most of 
manager Tom Kelly's teams, this one was fundamentally sound. For example, 
the team committed the third fewest errors in the major leagues in spite 
of its inexperience. Chad Allen, Hunter, and Matt Lawton saw consistent 
playing time in the outfield. However, Jacque Jones saw enough at bats 
to supplant Allen the following season, leading to the "Soul Patrol" of 
Jones, Hunter, and Lawton. Terry Steinbach was the starting catcher, with 
Javier Valentín as his backup. Three of the infield positions were fairly 
stable, with Mientkiewicz getting the bulk of the time at first base, Todd 
Walker at second, and Cristian Guzmán at short. Although Coomer was the 
opening day third baseman, Koskie ended up playing the most games at that 
position. (Coomer saw time at first when it became apparent that Mientkiewicz 
was not yet ready to face major-league pitchers.) Brent Gates also saw 
substantial playing time at third, as well as second. Marty Cordova played 
in 88 games as the designated hitter. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
