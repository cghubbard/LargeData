The 1966 Minnesota Twins finished 89–73, second in the American League. 
1,259,374 fans attended Twins games, the second highest total in the American 
League. In the June 9 game against the Kansas City Athletics, the Twins 
set a major-league record that still stands, by hitting five home runs 
in their half of the seventh inning. Only a Sandy Valdespino groundout 
amidst the onslaught kept them from being consecutive. Rich Rollins homered 
to drive in two, followed by solo shots by Zoilo Versalles, Tony Oliva, 
Don Mincher and Harmon Killebrew, with his second of the day. On July 21, 
in a 1-0 three-hit win over the Washington Senators, pitcher Jim Merritt 
struck out seven consecutive batters in the middle innings to set an American 
League record. Against the California Angels on August 18, the Twins turned 
their first-ever triple play, off a grounder by Frank Malzone. The play 
went Rich Rollins to César Tovar to Harmon Killebrew to retire the side. 
Jim Kaat won an AL best 25 games. Kaat became the first pitcher in the 
history of the American League to win 25 games but not win the Cy Young 
Award.[1] Kaat also won his fifth Gold Glove. He led the AL in: wins, games 
started, complete games, innings pitched, batters faced, most hits allowed, 
fewest walks per nine innings and strikeout-to-walk ratio. The Sporting 
News named Kaat the AL Pitcher of the Year. Tony Oliva led the AL with 
191 hits. Harmon Killebrew again led the team with 39 HR and 110 RBI.[2] 
Four Twins made the All-Star Game: first baseman Harmon Killebrew, outfielder 
Tony Oliva, catcher Earl Battey, and pitcher Jim Kaat. [1] [2] [3] [4]
