Richard Santo Aurilia (/əˈriːljə/; born September 2, 1971) is a former 
Major League Baseball player, mainly as a shortstop. The 24th round pick 
of the Texas Rangers in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft, Aurilia played 
in the Rangers minor league system before being traded with first baseman 
Desi Wilson to the San Francisco Giants for pitcher John Burkett in 1994. 
Aurilia was born in Brooklyn, New York. Before being drafted by Texas, 
Aurilia was a standout at St. John's University, where he represented the 
Red Storm as an All-Big East selection in 1992. Aurilia is also a graduate 
of Xaverian High School in Brooklyn, New York.[1] He was inducted into 
the school's Hall of Fame, and his number 22 was retired by local baseball 
league, Our Lady of Grace. Aurilia made his Major League debut on September 
6, 1995 as a defensive replacement in a game against the Montréal Expos. 
This would begin his long, solid run as the Giants shortstop. On June 14, 
1997, during his first stint with the Giants, Aurilia hit the first-ever 
grand slam in interleague play at the expense of the Anaheim Angels' Allen 
Watson, a former teammate. The Giants went on to win the game 10–3. 2001 
would prove to be a banner year for Aurilia as he collected a National 
League best 206 hits, all leading to a .324 batting average with 37 home 
runs, 97 RBI, an NL All-Star nod, and a Silver Slugger Award. However, 
his career best 37 home run year in 2001 was overshadowed by Barry Bonds' 
record breaking 73 home runs in the same season. From 1999 to 2001, he 
led NL shortstops in home runs. Production trailed off in 2002, but Aurilia 
shined once again in San Francisco's failed 2002 run for a World Series 
Championship. In 14 postseason games that season, he batted .296, with 
5 home runs and 14 RBI (an NL record for a shortstop in the postseason). 
He also was a Roberto Clemente Award nominee. After offensive stagnation 
in 2003, the Giants severed their nine-year relation with the shortstop, 
granting him free agency on October 27. Soon after, Aurilia signed on with 
the Seattle Mariners to patrol the M's infield. The lifetime National Leaguer 
could not get a grip on American League pitching, and was dealt to the 
San Diego Padres in July 2004. He continued to struggle in spacious Petco 
Park, and was not tendered a contract for 2005. Needing a veteran infielder, 
the Reds signed Aurilia to a minor league contract on January 22, 2005. 
The versatile infielder played well for the Reds collecting 14 home runs 
and 68 RBI as Cincinnati's shortstop, second baseman, and third baseman. 
The Reds then re-signed him on January 8, 2006. Aurilia served as an everyday 
player rotating between shortstop, second base, first base and third base 
for the Reds in 2006. He finished the year with 23 home runs, 70 RBI, and 
a batting average of exactly .300—his highest in all three categories since 
2001. In the 2006 offseason, Aurilia signed a two-year, $8 million contract 
with his old team, the Giants. During the 2007 season, he appeared in 99 
games (mostly at first base), starting in 81 of them. Aurilia was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list with a neck injury that had been slow to heal, 
limiting his range of movement and causing headaches. At the time, he was 
batting only .236 with two home runs. Aurilia returned to the Giants' lineup 
on July 4, hitting a home run in a 9–5 win over the Cincinnati Reds. He 
finished the season batting .252 with five home runs, 33 RBI, and a .304 
on-base percentage. Aurilia posted better numbers in each of those categories 
during the 2008 season, where he remained generally healthy throughout 
the year, one factor that led him to have considerably more playing time 
(99 games started). On February 9, 2009, Aurilia re-signed with the San 
Francisco Giants to a minor league deal.[2] It was announced on April 4 
that Aurilia had made the Giants final roster.[3] He went on to appear 
in 60 games during the 2009 season, starting in 22 of them, playing either 
first or third base. There was considerable uncertainty whether Aurilia 
would stay with the team for the entire season, but he was placed on the 
DL twice in order to free up a roster spot long enough for the September 
roster expansion. Knowing that the organization would not be bringing him 
back for the 2010 season, Aurilia played his final game as a Giant on October 
1 at home against the Arizona Diamondbacks, receiving standing ovations 
from the home fans in appreciation for 12 years with the team. Aurilia 
announced his retirement on April 11, 2010. He is currently a member of 
Comcast SportsNet Bay Area. Aurilia appeared on the ABC soap opera General 
Hospital in 2003. He finished second in a pro on pro challenge on Guy's 
Grocery Games on September 20, 2015.[4] His charity was the Make-A-Wish 
Foundation. Aurilia married Amy Krzyzkowski on June 28, 2015. He has 2 
sons: Chaz Aiden, (born August 18, 2001) and Gavin Shea, (born October
