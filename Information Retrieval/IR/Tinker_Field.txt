Tinker Field was an outdoor-baseball stadium in Orlando, Florida, United 
States. It was named after baseball Hall of Famer, Joe Tinker. Tinker Field 
was located in the West Lakes neighborhoods of Downtown Orlando, adjacent 
to the Camping World Stadium and one mile west of the Amway Center. In 
April, 2015 the City of Orlando tore down the grandstands and removed all 
other extant buildings. Constructed in 1914, Tinker Field was the spring 
training home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Cincinnati Reds, Washington Senators 
and Minnesota Twins. It was also the home park of the Orlando Rays minor 
league baseball team before they moved to Cracker Jack Stadium in 2000. 
It is located directly adjacent to the western side of the Orlando Citrus 
Bowl Stadium and boasted a capacity of 5,100 before the grandstands were 
removed in 2015. The field first saw use for baseball in 1914, the first 
known stadium built on the site was in 1923, It was all wood construction 
and seated 1,500. For the next 10 years, the Cincinnati Reds would call 
Tinker Field their spring training home til 1933. The Brooklyn Dodgers 
trained there in 1934 and 1935. In 1936 Clark Griffith moved the Washington 
Senators to Orlando where the Washington Senators/Minnesota Twins would 
train until after the 1990 season. The stadium was rebuilt again in 1963, 
and when Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C. was demolished nearly 1,000 
of the stadium's seats were moved to Tinker Field. The remaining seats 
were sold by the City of Orlando in 2015.[2] The old press box next to 
the home side dugout was the original press box and can be seen in photographs 
as early as the 1920s. On May 14, 2004, Tinker Field was added to the United 
States National Register of Historic Places. One of the most historical 
non-baseball events to take place at Tinker Field was a visit from Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. on March 6, 1964. He spoke before thousands of 
people from the pitcher's mound in his only visit ever to Central Florida.[3] 
On January 28, 2014, during the groundbreaking of the Orlando Citrus Bowl 
Stadium reconstruction it was announced that the grandstands and all other 
extant buildings surrounding Tinker Field would be torn down. The reasons 
cited were that the expansion of the Orlando Citrus Bowl Stadium would 
shorten right field so much that it would make it unusable even if it the 
entire building complex was renovated. On March 9, 2015, Orlando City Council 
approved an ordinance to demolish the grandstands and buildings, and allocated 
money to re-create the area surrounding the field.[4] In September, 2015, 
the City of Orlando held a public input meeting and unveiled preliminary 
plans to memorialize Tinker Field.[5] Each November, Tinker Field hosts 
the Electric Daisy Carnival – a two-day festival that features electronic 
dance music with celebrity DJs, visual effects, rides, and art.[6] On September 
6, 2015, Tinker Field was the site of West Lakes Family Fun Day – an event 
held by members of the neighborhoods surrounding the field prior to the 
MEAC/SWAC Challenge. The outside of the original wood grandstands of Tinker
