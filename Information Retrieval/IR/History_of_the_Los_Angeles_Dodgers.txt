The history of the Los Angeles Dodgers begins in the 19th century when 
the team was based in Brooklyn, New York. The franchise now known as the 
Dodgers was originally formed in 1883 as a member of the minor league Inter-State 
Association of Professional Baseball Clubs. It moved to the American Association 
the following year and eventually to the National League in 1890. The team 
went by a number of nicknames including the Brooklyn Atlantics, Brooklyn 
Grays, Brooklyn Bridegrooms, Brooklyn Grooms, Brooklyn Superbas, and Brooklyn 
Robins before setting on the Brooklyn Dodgers (shortened from Trolley Dodgers) 
in the 1930s. During the Brooklyn era, the team won the AA championship 
in 1889 and National League championships twelve times (1890, 1899, 1900, 
1916, 1920, 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955 1956) and won their first 
World Series championship in 1955. The Brooklyn Dodgers had several Hall 
of Fame players on their rosters during this era including Roy Campanella, 
Leo Durocher, Burleigh Grimes, Willie Keeler, Pee Wee Reese, Wilbert Robinson, 
Duke Snider, Dazzy Vance, Zack Wheat and Jackie Robinson. Robinson, the 
first African American to play major professional baseball, made his debut 
as a Dodger in 1947 and won the first Rookie of the Year award. The Brooklyn 
Dodgers played their final game at Ebbets Field on September 24, 1957, 
which the Dodgers won 2–0 over the Pittsburgh Pirates. On April 18, 1958, 
the Los Angeles Dodgers played their first game in LA, defeating the former 
New York and now new San Francisco Giants, 6–5, before 78,672 fans at the 
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.[1] Sadly, catcher Roy Campanella, left partially 
paralyzed in an off-season accident, was never able to play for Los Angeles. 
The process of building Walter O'Malley's dream stadium soon began in semi-rural 
Chavez Ravine, in the hills just north of downtown L.A. There was some 
political controversy, as the residents of the ravine, mostly Hispanic 
and mostly poor, resisted the eminent domain removal of their homes (land 
which had been previously condemned for a public housing project, Elysian 
Park Heights) and gained some public sympathy. Still, O'Malley and the 
city government were determined, and construction proceeded. The resistance 
of the residents against their removal was known as the Battle of Chavez 
Ravine. In the meantime, the Dodgers played their home games from 1958 
to 1961 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, a gargantuan football and 
track-and-field stadium that had been built in 1923, and then expanded 
to host the 1932 Summer Olympics. The Coliseum's dimensions were not optimal 
for baseball, and the best way to fit a baseball diamond into the oval-shaped 
stadium was to lay the third-base line parallel to the short axis of the 
oval, and the first-base parallel to the long axis. This resulted in a 
left-field fence that was only about 250 feet from home plate. A 40-foot 
high screen was erected to prevent home runs from becoming too trivial 
to hit. Still, the 1958 season saw 182 home runs hit to left field in the 
home games, whereas just three were hit to center field, and only eight 
to right field. The Dodgers outfielder Wally Moon, newly acquired for the 
1959 season, became adept at launching lazy fly balls over or onto the 
screen, which became known as "Moon shots." He led the National League 
with triples in 1959. In 1959, the season ended in a tie between the Dodgers 
and the Milwaukee Braves. The Dodgers won the tie-breaking playoff. 1959 
also saw a team other than the Yankees win the A.L. pennant, one of only 
two such years in the 16-year stretch from 1949 through 1964, and because 
of the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles, this resulted in the first World Series 
since 1948 to have no games in New York City. In a lively World Series, 
the Dodgers defeated the "Go-Go" White Sox in six games, thoroughly cementing 
the bond between the baseball team and its new Southern California fans. 
Commemorating its 50th year in Los Angeles, the Dodgers team again played 
one more game in the Memorial Coliseum on March 29, 2008 – an exhibition 
game to benefit a cancer research charity. The crowd of 115,300, the largest 
in baseball history in any country, any league, saw the Dodgers lose to 
the Boston Red Sox by a score of 7–4. Due to intervening renovations, the 
Coliseum's left field corner was shortened to only 190 feet, calling for 
an even-taller left-field fence of 60 feet. Kevin Cash of the Red Sox and 
James Loney of the Dodgers did hit home runs over that fence, but there 
were unexpectedly few home runs in the game. Despite the passage of 50 
plus years since departing from Brooklyn, many in the borough, and the 
nation, continue efforts to encourage a move back east. Many of these efforts 
take the shape of letter writing campaigns, online petitions and nostalgic 
articles.[2] Brooklyn Dodgers merchandise is still popular among fans as 
well. Major League Baseball estimates $9 million in sales every year. The 
Baseball Hall of Fame reports that Brooklyn photos and broadcasts are the 
museum's second biggest sellers behind the Yankees, Ebay lists close to 
1,000 items a day relating to the Brooklyn Dodgers, and the Library of 
Congress has over 100 books on Brooklyn Dodger teams, third only to the 
Yankees and Red Sox.[3] There were occasional attempts to move the Dodgers 
back to Brooklyn. State Senator Thomas J. Bartosiewicz tried hard to persuade 
them in the early 1980s, but was rebuffed. A stronger chance was in 1998, 
when the O'Malley family sold up to Rupert Murdoch's Fox company. In the 
course of bidding, a committee convened by the City and State of New York 
(including Roger Kahn, author of Boys of Summer) made an offer to the club 
which was turned down, despite being larger than the eventual sale price. 
Construction on Dodger Stadium was completed in time for Opening Day 1962. 
With its clean, simple lines and its picturesque setting amid hills and 
palm trees, the ballpark quickly became an icon of the Dodgers and their 
new California lifestyle, and it remains one of the most highly regarded 
stadiums in baseball even today. Despite the fact that the Dodgers have 
played in Dodger Stadium longer than they had played in Ebbets Field, the 
stadium remains surprisingly fresh. O'Malley was determined that there 
would not be a bad seat in the house, achieving this by cantilevered grandstands 
that have since been widely imitated. More importantly for the team, the 
stadium's spacious dimensions, along with other factors, gave defense an 
advantage over offense, and the Dodgers moved to take advantage of this 
by assembling a team that would excel with its pitching. The core of the 
team's success in the 1960s was the dominant pitching tandem of Sandy Koufax 
and Don Drysdale, who combined to win 4 of the 5 Cy Young Awards from 1962 
to 1966, during a time in which only one award was given to the top pitcher 
from either of the two major leagues. Top pitching also came from Claude 
Osteen, an aging Johnny Podres, and reliever Ron Perranoski. The hitting 
attack, on the other hand, was not impressive, and much of the offensive 
spark came from the exploits of speedy shortstop Maury Wills, who led the 
league in stolen bases every year from 1960 to 1965, and set a modern record 
with 104 thefts in 1962. The Dodgers' strategy was once described as follows: 
"Wills hits a single, steals second, and takes third on a grounder. A sacrifice 
fly brings him home. Koufax or Drysdale pitches a shutout, and the Dodgers 
win 1-0." Although few games followed this model exactly, the Dodgers nevertheless 
tallied a high proportion of wins in a low-scoring manner that relied on 
their pitching and defense rather than their offense – with the exception 
of a few seasons. For example, in 1962, Tommy Davis led the Major Leagues 
with 153 RBI, and he led the National League in batting average and in 
hits. Seasons of over 150 RBI are quite rare by a player in modern-day 
pro baseball. Davis led the league in batting twice for the Dodgers. The 
1962 pennant race ended in a tie, and the Dodgers were defeated by the 
archrival Giants in the tie-breaking playoff, but the Dodgers proceeded 
to win the pennant in three of the next four years. The 1963 World Series 
was a four-game sweep of the Yankees, in which the Dodgers were so dominant 
that the vaunted Bronx Bombers never even took a lead against Koufax, Podres, 
and Drysdale. After an injury-plagued 1964, the Dodgers bounced back to 
win the 1965 World Series in a seven games against the Minnesota Twins. 
Game one happened to fall on the Yom Kippur holiday, and Koufax (who is 
Jewish) refused to pitch on that day, a decision for which he was widely 
praised. The Dodgers rebounded from losing the first two games, with Koufax 
pitching shutouts in Games five and seven (with only two days rest in between) 
to win the crown and the World Series MVP Award. The Dodgers again won 
the pennant in 1966, but the team was running out of gas, and it was swept 
in the World Series by the upstart Baltimore Orioles. Koufax retired that 
winter, with his career cut short by arthritis in the elbow of his pitching 
arm, and Maury Wills was traded away. Don Drysdale continued to be effective, 
setting a record with six consecutive shutouts in 1968, but he finished 
with just a 14–12 record due to the Dodgers' poor hitting that year. While 
the Dodgers were sub-par for several seasons thereafter, a new core of 
young talent was developing in their farm system. They won another pennant 
in 1974, and although they were quickly dismissed by the dynastic Oakland 
Athletics in the World Series, it was a sign of good things to come. For 
23 years, beginning in 1954, the Dodgers had been managed by Walter Alston, 
a quiet and unflappable man who commanded great respect from his players. 
Alston's tenure is the third-longest in baseball history for a manager 
with a single team, after Connie Mack and John McGraw. His retirement near 
the end of the 1976 season, after winning 7 pennants and 4 World Series 
titles over his career, cleared the way for an entirely different personality 
to take the helm of the Dodgers. Tommy Lasorda was a 49-year-old former 
minor-league pitcher who had been the team's top coach under Alston, and 
before that had been manager of the Dodgers' top minor league team. He 
was colorful and gregarious, an enthusiastic cheerleader in contrast to 
Alston's taciturn demeanor. He quickly became a larger-than-life personality, 
associating with Frank Sinatra and other celebrities, with a penchant for 
eating Italian food in large volumes. He became well known for sayings 
such as, "If you cut me, I bleed Dodger blue", and for referring to God 
as "the Great Dodger in the sky." Although some considered his persona 
to be a schtick and found it wearing, his enthusiasm won him a reputation 
as an "ambassador for baseball", and it is impossible to think of the Dodgers 
from the late 1970s to the early 1990s without thinking of Lasorda. Another 
transition had recently occurred, higher up in the Dodgers management. 
Walter O'Malley passed control of the team to his son Peter, who would 
continue to oversee the Dodgers on his family's behalf through 1998. New 
blood had also been injected into the team on the field. The core of the 
team was now the infield, composed of Steve Garvey (1B), Davey Lopes (2B), 
Bill Russell (SS), Ron Cey (3B), and Steve Yeager (C). These five remained 
in the starting lineup together from 1973 to 1981, longer than any other 
infield fivesome in baseball history. The pitching staff remained strong, 
anchored by Don Sutton and Tommy John. The Dodgers won NL West titles in 
both 1977 and 1978, and defeated the Philadelphia Phillies both years in 
the National League Championship Series, only to be defeated in the World 
Series both years by the Yankees. In 1980, they swept a three-game series 
from the Houston Astros in the final weekend of the regular season (including 
Don Sutton's brilliant save) and were in a first place tie in the National 
League West, but lost to the Astros 7–1 in the one-game playoff. The Opening 
Day starting pitcher for 1981 was a 20-year-old rookie from Mexico: Fernando 
Valenzuela. Pressed into service due to an injury to Jerry Reuss, Valenzuela 
pitched a shutout that day, and proceeded to win his first 8 decisions 
through mid-May. The youthful left-hander, speaking only Spanish but sporting 
a devastating screwball, became a sensation. "Fernandomania" gripped both 
Southern California, where huge crowds turned out to see him pitch, as 
well as in his home country of Mexico, where the number of radio stations 
that carried Dodger games increased that year from three stations to 17.[4] 
Valenzuela became the only pitcher ever to be named Rookie of the Year 
and win the Cy Young Award in the same season. The Dodgers' torrid start 
assured them of a playoff berth in the strike-shortened split season. After 
defeating the Montreal Expos with the help of a ninth-inning two-out home 
run by Rick Monday in the fifth and deciding game of the National League 
Championship Series they proceeded to defeat the Yankees in the World Series 
in six games, with the World Series MVP award split three ways among Ron 
Cey, Pedro Guerrero and Steve Yeager. The Dodgers won NL West titles in 
1983 and 1985, but lost in the NLCS both those years (to the Phillies and 
Cardinals, respectively). The 1985 NLCS was particularly memorable for 
Game 6, in which the Dodgers were protecting a 5–4 lead in the ninth inning, 
hoping to force a deciding seventh game. With two runners on and first 
base open, Lasorda elected not to walk Cards slugger Jack Clark, who proceeded 
to hit a home run off Tom Niedenfuer and send St. Louis to the World Series. 
After seven years of high strikeout totals, and a 21-win season in 1986, 
Valenzuela sat out for most of the 1988 season. Plagued by arm troubles 
that were widely blamed on his being overused by Lasorda, his effectiveness 
faded before he turned 30. The new anchor of the pitching staff was a right-hander 
named Orel Hershiser. He had been given the nickname "Bulldog" by Lasorda, 
more as a hopeful motivational tool than an objective description of his 
personality, but by 1988 he had matured into one of baseball's most effective 
pitchers. That year he won 23 games and the Cy Young Award, and broke Don 
Drysdale's major league record by tossing 59 consecutive scoreless innings, 
ending with a 10-inning shutout on his final start of the season. The 1988 
Championship won by the Dodgers is all the more magical for the fact that 
the Dodgers were not expected to compete. They enjoyed career years from 
several players, and were inspired by the fiery intensity of newcomer Kirk 
Gibson (the league's Most Valuable Player that year), as well as the quiet 
but steady Hershiser and the always ebullient Lasorda. Although they entered 
the NLCS as decided underdogs to the powerful New York Mets, against whom 
they were 1–10 during the regular season, the Dodgers prevailed in a back-and-forth 
series that went the entire seven games and saw Hershiser come on for the 
save in game 4 (preceded by a dramatic 9th-inning home run by Mike Scioscia 
off Dwight Gooden). The World Series matched them with an even more powerful 
opponent, the Oakland Athletics, who owned baseball's best regular-season 
record with 104 wins against only 58 defeats. Featuring the "Bash Brothers" 
duo of Mark McGwire and José Canseco, the A's took an early lead in Game 
1 on a grand slam by Canseco, and led 4–3 going into the bottom of the 
ninth inning. With two outs, pinch-hitter Mike Davis drew a base on balls 
from formidable closer Dennis Eckersley. During Davis' at-bat, Lasorda 
had the light-hitting infielder Dave Anderson on deck so the Athletics 
would pitch to Davis more carefully. Then, Gibson, hobbled by injuries 
to both his legs that included a strained MCL and a severely pulled hamstring, 
came in to pinch hit. After fighting off several pitches and working the 
count full, Gibson got the backdoor slider he was looking for and pulled 
it into the right field pavilion for a two-run, walk-off home run, winning 
the game for the Dodgers, 5–4. Widely considered one of the most memorable 
and improbable home runs in baseball history, Gibson's dramatic home run 
was his only appearance of the entire series, and it set the tone for the 
following four games. Hershiser dominated the Athletics in Games 2 and 
5, and was on the mound when the Dodgers completed their stunning 4 games 
to 1 upset of the A's, capping off an incredible personal season by being 
named the Series MVP. They won the Series in Game 5 with lifetime reserves 
Danny Heep and Mickey Hatcher in the starting lineup. After 1988, the Dodgers 
did not win another postseason game until 2004, though they did reach the 
playoffs in 1995 and 1996, narrowly missed in 1991 and 1997, and led the 
NL West when the end of the 1994 season was cancelled by a strike. Hershiser, 
like Valenzuela before him, suffered an arm injury in 1990, and he never 
regained the production he had earlier in his career. From 1992 to 1996, 
five consecutive Dodgers were named Rookie of the Year: Eric Karros, Mike 
Piazza, Raúl Mondesí, Hideo Nomo, and Todd Hollandsworth, which is a record. 
After nearly 20 years at the helm, Lasorda retired in 1996, though he still 
remained with the Dodgers as an executive vice-president. He was replaced 
as manager by longtime Dodgers shortstop Bill Russell. Nearly a half-century 
of unusual stability (only two managers 1954–1996, owned by a single family 
1950–1998) finally came to an end. After L.A. city officials rejected a 
proposal to bring an NFL stadium and franchise to Chavez Ravine in 1998, 
the O'Malley family sold the Dodgers to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, 
owner of the Fox network (which also owns broadcast rights to MLB games) 
and 20th Century Fox. Among the new ownership's early moves were trading 
away popular catcher Piazza, and replacing Russell with veteran manager 
Davey Johnson. Johnson's volatile tenure ended two years later, and he 
was followed as manager by Jim Tracy. Fox made the first changes to the 
home uniform since the club moved from Brooklyn and introduced the team's 
first alternate jersey and cap, adding silver to the team's official colors 
(although they have rarely been used since). The team became more steady 
on the field in the early 2000s (decade), with four consecutive winning 
seasons under the leadership of manager Tracy, starting pitchers Chan Ho 
Park and Kevin Brown, slugger Shawn Green, third baseman Adrián Beltré, 
and catcher Paul Lo Duca. The 2002 season was marked by the emergence of 
Éric Gagné as one of baseball's top relief pitchers. Gagné later won the 
Cy Young Award in 2003, converting all 55 of his save opportunities that 
year, and holding the league to a 1.20 ERA and striking out 137 batters 
in 82⅓ innings. Gagné would later establish a new major league record for 
consecutive saves, with 84 saves spanning parts of the 2002, 2003 and 2004 
seasons. In 2004, the Dodgers were returned to family ownership, as News 
Corp sold the team to Boston real estate developer Frank McCourt. McCourt 
immediately hired Paul DePodesta as his new general manager, replacing 
Dan Evans. As an assistant general manager in Oakland under Billy Beane, 
DePodesta favored a highly statistical approach to evaluating prospects 
and potential free-agents. This sabermetric approach, widely publicized 
in the book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game by Michael Lewis, 
led many to believe that new owner McCourt was unwilling to pay for high 
priced talent, and would thus reduce the Dodgers to a status similar to 
small-market teams such as Oakland. With a team largely assembled by DePodesta's 
predecessors, and augmented by some acquisitions of his own, DePodesta 
saw the Dodgers near the top of the standings through much of 2004. In 
an effort to put the team over the top that year, DePodesta pulled off 
a number of mid-season trades, including sending away three key players 
(including popular team leader LoDuca), while obtaining several new players. 
The Dodgers did manage to win the NL West in 2004, but bowed out quickly 
in four games in the Division Series to the eventual National League champion 
St. Louis Cardinals. During the winter of 2004–05, the team parted ways 
with several more longtime players, including Beltré and Green. Their replacements 
included starting pitcher Derek Lowe, outfielder J. D. Drew, and the run-producing, 
but aging second baseman Jeff Kent. DePodesta's radical overhaul did not 
bear fruit in 2005, as the Dodgers suffered from clubhouse strife and stifling 
injuries, finishing with their second-worst record in Los Angeles history. 
The club also faced an overwhelming number of injuries that quickly scuttled 
the team's hopes of repeating as division champions. Among them were Drew's 
broken wrist, All-Star shortstop César Izturis's injury that required Tommy 
John surgery, and closer Gagné's deteriorating elbow condition that would 
also require surgery and force him to miss much of the 2005 season. Manager 
Jim Tracy also parted ways with the team at the end of the 2005 season, 
citing irreconcilable differences with DePodesta. However, DePodesta himself 
was fired by McCourt less than a month later, with McCourt later citing 
DePodesta's lack of leadership and dissatisfaction over DePodesta's handling 
of the process of hiring a new manager. Ned Colletti was hired as the new 
Dodger GM on November 16, 2005. Newly hired Colletti was responsible for 
a tangible change in attitude and guided the Dodgers' resurgence in the 
2006 season. He hired former Red Sox manager Grady Little to lead the team 
and also traded oft-troubled Milton Bradley for Oakland Athletics prospect 
Andre Ethier. His off season acquisitions also included former Atlanta 
Braves shortstop Rafael Furcal and former Red Sox third baseman Bill Mueller. 
Coletti also signed former All-Star shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, even though 
the team already had two other former All-Star shortstops (Furcal and the 
then-injured César Izturis). Garciaparra agreed to play first base and 
adjusted quite well in the field and remained productive at the plate, 
producing several key hits in Dodger victories. Due to the crowded infield, 
untimely injuries and several players' lack of production, the team was 
rebuilt during the season. The flurry of trading saw César Izturis go to 
the Chicago Cubs for Greg Maddux while Willy Aybar and Danys Báez went 
to Atlanta for Wilson Betemit. A series of rookies were called up and provided 
substantial everyday contributions. Among them were catcher Russell Martin, 
who won the starting catching job after being called up in May and starting 
pitcher Chad Billingsley, who had several quality starts in August and 
September. Andre Ethier led the team in batting with a .308 batting average 
as the team's everyday left fielder through much of the season. Rookie 
first baseman James Loney hit very well in his short time with the team, 
tying Gil Hodges’ 56-year-old Dodgers record with 9 RBI in one game on 
September 28. Another key move was handing the closer's role to rookie 
(but Japanese League veteran) Takashi Saito, where he flourished, notching 
24 saves in 26 opportunities while posting a 2.07 ERA. After a heated pennant 
race, in which the most memorable moment occurred when the Dodgers hit 
four consecutive home runs on September 18 to tie the score in the ninth 
inning and then won the game on a tenth-inning walk-off homer by Nomar 
Garciaparra, the Dodgers entered the 2006 playoffs in the National League's 
Wild Card spot, having tied the San Diego Padres for the division lead 
but having lost 13 of 18 head-to-head meetings with the Padres. They were 
eventually swept, 3–0, by the New York Mets in the 2006 National League 
Division Series. In 2007, the Los Angeles Dodgers sent three players (Brad 
Penny, Takashi Saito, and Russell Martin) to the all-star game, and at 
one point, the Dodgers had a record of 54-41, which was then the best record 
in the National League. After a hitting slump, the Dodgers fell to 60–59, 
and seven games out of first place in the N.L. West. The Dodgers were able 
to rebound, however, and had a 79-69 record with three weeks left in the 
season. At this point, the Dodgers trailed the San Diego Padres by 1½ games 
in the wild card slot, and the Arizona Diamondbacks by 3½ games. However, 
the Dodgers lost 10 of their next 11 games, which eliminated the Dodgers 
from post season play, and would finish the season with a disappointing 
82-80 record. The last few weeks of the season were disrupted further by 
public complaints in the media by some of the veteran ballplayers about 
the lack of respect afforded them by some of the younger players on the 
team. This led to a divided clubhouse, as younger players consistently 
got more playing time at the expense of the veterans. After the season 
and weeks of media speculation, Grady Little resigned as manager, citing 
personal reasons [2]. A few days later the Dodgers announced the hiring 
of former New York Yankees skipper Joe Torre to be the team's new manager.[5] 
At the start of the 2008 season, Joe Torre found himself with a whole new 
team, including new players Andruw Jones and Japanese pitcher Hiroki Kuroda. 
To add to his troubles, Don Mattingly was unable to perform his hitting 
coach duties, and third basemen Nomar Garciaparra and Andy LaRoche were 
out with injuries, leaving the starting third base position to rookie Blake 
DeWitt, who had never played above level A ball in the minor leagues. DeWitt 
stepped up early, when Nomar went down again with a calf injury. The team 
suffered a serious blow when star player Rafael Furcal was injured in the 
midst of the best start of his career. Many substitutions were used, including 
rookies Chin-Lung Hu and Luis Maza, but could not duplicate Furcal's offense. 
Staff ace Brad Penny and slugger Jones began to underperform, leading to 
trips to the DL for both. Despite the problems with the roster, as well 
as their record, the Dodgers were only behind first-place Arizona by one 
game at the All-Star break. The season saw progress in the teams prospects, 
including a call-up for top prospect Clayton Kershaw, as well as comebacks 
from veteran pitchers, most notably Chan Ho Park. Chad Billingsley quickly 
grew to be the team's ace, being one of the leaders in strikeouts and ERA 
and being the first pitcher on the Dodgers to get double-digit wins. For 
the majority of the season, the club hovered around a .500 record. To bolster 
a lineup of mostly young players, Ned Colletti made trades for shortstop 
Ángel Berroa, third-baseman Casey Blake, and on July 31, 2008 the Los Angeles 
Dodgers acquired outfielder Manny Ramirez from the Boston Red Sox in a 
3-way deal that sent third baseman Andy LaRoche and single-A prospect pitcher 
Bryan Morris to the Pittsburgh Pirates and all-star outfielder Jason Bay 
to the Red Sox. Ramirez brought an energy to the team that it had lacked 
previously and also energized the fanbase. After playing more than 140 
games of catch-up, the Dodgers swept Arizona to take first place in the 
last series of the season for the two teams on September 7 after being 
4 games behind the week before. The Dodgers clinched the 2008 National 
League Western Division title on September 25 as the Arizona Diamondbacks 
were eliminated by losing to the St. Louis Cardinals 12–3. On October 4, 
2008 they beat the Cubs 3-0 to sweep the 2008 NLDS and moved on to the 
NLCS, where they faced the Philadelphia Phillies and were eliminated, losing 
the series in five games. In 2009, however, Manny was suspended for taking 
a performing-enhancing substance. Despite the 50 game suspension, the Dodgers 
repeated as National League West Champions and once again faced the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the National League Championship Series [NLCS] after sweeping 
[3-0] the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Division Series [NLDS]. 
They once more lost to Philadelphia [1-4]. The following season, a procession 
of injuries caused the Dodgers to fall out of the race by late summer... 
Manny Ramirez was traded to the Chicago White Sox in August and in September 
Joe Torre announced his decision to retire as Dodgers manager, to be replaced 
by Don Mattingly. On October 14, 2009, it was announced the McCourts would 
be separating after nearly 30 years of marriage.[6] While speculation was 
raised on the impact upon the McCourt family Dodger ownership, a spokesperson 
for Jamie McCourt said the following day that "the focus of the Dodgers 
is on the playoffs and the World Series". Jamie was fired from her position 
as Dodgers CEO on Thursday, October 22, 2009, the day after the Dodgers 
were eliminated from the playoffs, thus ending the reign of the self-proclaimed 
"First Female CEO of a Baseball Team."[6] She officially filed for divorce 
shortly thereafter. Frank claimed that the divorce would have "no bearing 
on the team whatsoever". "[7] Despite that assertion, media speculation 
continued that the team was in financial difficulty. On March 31, 2011, 
after the Opening Day game against the San Francisco Giants, a Giants fan 
was attacked by two men wearing Dodgers attire in the Dodger Stadium parking 
lot.[8] He suffered serious injuries and was diagnosed with brain damage. 
In response, the Dodgers and Giants held a joint fundraiser to benefit 
the victim, a reward was offered for the capture of the attackers and security 
was beefed up at the stadium. On April 20, Baseball commissioner Bud Selig 
announced that MLB would be appointing a representative to oversee the 
day-to-day operations of the Dodgers. His statement said that he took that 
action because of his "deep concerns for the finances and operations" of 
the Dodgers.[9] On June 27, one week after the commissioner refused to 
approve a proposed television contract that would have pumped much needed 
funding into the club, the Dodgers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[10] 
After much legal wrangling between McCouts lawyers and MLB lawyers in bankruptcy 
court, he reached a deal with the league to put the team up for sale.[11] 
On March 27, 2012, it was announced that an agreement had been reached 
on the sale of the Dodgers between Frank McCourt and Guggenheim Baseball 
Management LLC, a group of investors fronted by Guggenheim CEO Mark Walter 
and including former Los Angeles Lakers player Magic Johnson, baseball 
executive Stan Kasten and film mogul Peter Guber.[12] The total sale price 
for the Dodgers (which includes Dodger Stadium) exceeded $2 billion, making 
the sale the largest for a professional sports team in history, exceeding 
the approximately $1.5 billion purchase of Manchester United F.C. by Malcolm 
Glazer in 2005,[13] On the same day, it was also announced that the members 
of the group will partner McCourt in purchasing the property surrounding 
the stadium.[14] The sale price of the Dodgers was considered to be far 
higher than what the team was actually worth at the time of sale. Estimates 
made by Forbes placed the value of the Dodgers at approximately $1.4 billion, 
and the winning bid was more than 30% higher than the next highest bid.[15] 
On April 13, the sale was approved by the bankruptcy court [16] and it 
officially closed on May 1, 2012.[17] The Guggenheim group didn't waste 
any time upgrading the team's roster. In a departure from the McCourt years, 
the Dodgers started acquiring big contracts in trades. They traded for 
third baseman/shortstop Hanley Ramírez from the Miami Marlins, outfielder 
Shane Victorino from the Philadelphia Phillies and, in what was described 
as the "biggest August trade in MLB history" Adrian Gonzalez, Josh Beckett 
and Carl Crawford from the Boston Red Sox.[18] In their first season of 
ownership, the Dodgers new owners added $431 million in salary commitments.[19] 
Despite the efforts, the Dodgers missed the playoffs for the third straight 
year. In the offseason the Dodgers went out and signed free agent starter 
Zack Greinke and Korean pitcher Hyun-jin Ryu to bolster their rotation. 
However, injuries to star players including Greinke, Ramírez and Matt Kemp 
got the team off to a slow start in 2013. On June 21 they were in last 
place in the division, 9 1/2 games behind the first place Arizona Diamondbacks. 
They turned things around in a hurry as players got healthy and Cuban defector 
Yasiel Puig joined the roster. The team went on a 46-10 run from June 22 
through August 23 and moved past all the other teams in their division. 
On September 19 they clinched the division title, the earliest the team 
had ever clinched. The deficit they overcame was the largest in franchise 
history and they were just the fourth team in MLB history to win the division 
after being in last place on July 1. The team advanced to the 2013 National 
League Championship Series but lost in six games to the St. Louis Cardinals. 
The 2014 season saw the emergence of Dee Gordon who took over the starting 
second base job and led the league in triples and stolen bases. Matt Kemp 
also returned to form after two seasons of batting injuries and Adrian 
Gonzalez led the league in RBI. The pitching staff featured another dominate 
performance by Clayton Kershaw, who was 21–3 with a 1.77 ERA. He was the 
first pitcher in history to lead the league in ERA four straight seasons. 
Kershaw and Josh Beckett both pitched no-hitters during the season and 
the Dodgers had four pitchers (Kershaw, Greinke, Ryu and Dan Haren) all 
win 13 or more games. The Dodgers won their second straight NL West championship 
but lost again to the Cardinals in the Division Series. Kershaw would win 
the NL Cy Young Award and the NL MVP Award, making him the first National 
League player to win both awards in the same season since Bob Gibson in 
1968. Following the disappointing end of the 2014 season, the Dodgers removed 
Ned Colletti from his job as GM and hired Andrew Friedman, formerly of 
the Tampa Bay Rays, to the newly created post of "President of Baseball 
Operations" with a mandate to rebuild the farm system so that the team 
could build from within instead of continuing to pursue costly free agents. 
The new front office made several trades that first off-season and drastically 
reshaped the roster. They traded away Matt Kemp, Dee Gordon, Dan Haren 
and others in moves that brought in Howie Kendrick, Jimmy Rollins, Yasmani 
Grandal and others. The team battled injuries in 2015 that removed two 
members of the projected starting rotation to early season ending injuries 
and Puig also spent much of the season injured. Rookies Joc Pederson and 
Corey Seager came up and showed potential and Kershaw and Greinke remained 
the best one-two punch starting pitchers in the league. The Dodgers won 
their third straight NL West title for the first time in franchise history 
but again flamed out in the first round of the playoffs, losing to the 
Mets. Following the 2015 season, the club parted ways with manager Don 
Mattingly and Greinke exercised and opt-out clause in his contract, going 
on to sign with division rival Arizona. The club hired San Diego coach 
and former Dodgers player Dave Roberts to be the team's new manager for
