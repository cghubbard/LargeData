Albert Leonard "Al" Rosen (February 29, 1924 – March 13, 2015), nicknamed 
"Flip" and "The Hebrew Hammer", was an American baseball third baseman 
and right-handed slugger in the Major Leagues for ten seasons in the 1940s 
and 1950s. After serving for four years in the U.S. Navy during World War 
II, Rosen played his entire ten-year career (from 1947 to 1956) with the 
Cleveland Indians in the American League. A stand-out on both offense and 
defense, he drove in 100 or more runs five consecutive years, was a four-time 
All-Star, twice led the league in home runs and twice in RBIs, and was 
an MVP. Rosen was a .285 career hitter, with 192 home runs and 717 RBIs 
in 1,044 games. He was selected for the All-Star Game from 1952 to 1955. 
Rosen appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1955. Following two 
decades as a stockbroker upon retirement from baseball, Rosen returned 
to the game as a top front office executive in the late 1970s, serving 
the New York Yankees, Houston Astros, and Giants variously as president, 
CEO, and general manager. Regarded as a GM who still thought like a player, 
he became the only former MVP to also earn baseball's Executive of the 
Year award.[1] Rosen was born in Spartanburg, South Carolina[2] to Louis 
and Rose (née Levin) Rosen. His father left the family shortly thereafter, 
and Rosen's mother and grandmother moved the family to Miami, Florida, 
when he was 18 months old.[3][4] Rosen suffered from asthma as a child, 
which prompted his family to move further south. While growing up, his 
two favorite baseball players were Lou Gehrig and Hank Greenberg. He attended 
Riverside Elementary School, Ada Merritt Junior High School, and then Miami 
Senior High School for a year attending Florida Military Academy in St. 
Petersburg, Florida, on a boxing scholarship.[4] After graduating from 
Florida Military Academy, Rosen enrolled in the University of Florida in 
Gainesville, Florida.[4] He left the university after a semester to play 
minor league baseball in North Carolina.[4] Rosen enlisted in 1942, and 
spent four years in the U.S. Navy fighting in the Pacific during World 
War II, delaying his professional baseball career. He navigated an assault 
boat in the initial landing on Okinawa in the bitter battle for the island.[3] 
In 1946, he left the Navy as a lieutenant and returned to his emerging 
baseball career. Rosen played for the 1946 Pittsfield Electrics, where 
he was initially given a back-up role. Upon leading the Canadian–American 
League in home runs (16) and RBIs (86), while batting .323, however, he 
was bestowed his idol Hank Greenberg's nickname, the "Hebrew Hammer".[3] 
Rosen played for the Oklahoma City Indians in 1947, and had one of the 
finest individual seasons in league history. He led all hitters in average 
(.349), hits (186), doubles (47), extra-base hits (83), RBIs (141), total 
bases (330), slugging percentage (.619), and on-base percentage (.437). 
He was elected Texas League MVP.[3] Rosen played for the New York Yankees' 
Kansas City Blues farm team in 1948. He was loaned to the Blues for the 
duration of the team's American Association season as part of a deal that 
sent reliever Charley Wensloff from the Yankees to the Indians.[5] Rosen 
was named Rookie of the Year in the American Association for his play with 
the Blues. Rosen made his first appearance in the major leagues in 1947 
at the age of 23. In 1948, Rosen played most of the year in minor leagues 
with the Kansas City Blues, before joining the Indians in September. He 
played in the 1948 World Series as a reserve behind regular third baseman 
Ken Keltner despite only playing five games during the season after the 
Indians requested his inclusion on the World Series roster.[6] When Keltner 
was traded in 1950, Rosen took over as the Indians' third baseman, leading 
the American League in home runs with 37, hitting more than any previous 
American League rookie.[7] It stood as the AL rookie record until Mark 
McGwire surpassed it in 1987.[8] He homered in four straight games in June, 
a feat unmatched by an Indians rookie until Jason Kipnis in 2011.[9][10] 
Rosen averaged a league-best homer every 15.0 at bats, and led the league 
as well in HBP (10). He batted .287 and had 116 runs batted in, while finishing 
fifth in the league with 100 walks and a .543 slugging percentage. His 
100 walks remained a team rookie record for a right-handed batter, through 
2014.[11] Despite his home run title, he finished 17th in the American 
League MVP Award voting. In 1951 Rosen led the league in games played, 
and was fifth in the league in RBIs (102), extra-base hits (55), and walks 
(85). He batted .265, with 24 home runs. Rosen hit four grand slams, a 
team season record that was not broken until Travis Hafner hit five in 
2006.[12] Rosen led the American League with 105 RBIs and 297 total bases 
in 1952. He also was third in the league in runs (101) and slugging percentage 
(.524), fifth in hits (171) and doubles (32), sixth in home runs (28), 
and seventh in batting average (.302). On April 29, he matched the then 
team record of three home runs in one game,[11] which was surpassed only 
when Rocky Colavito tied the Major League single-game record with four 
home runs on June 10, 1959. Rosen came in tenth in the American League 
MVP Award voting. In 1953, Rosen led the American League in home runs (43), 
runs batted in (145; still a record for an Indian third baseman, through 
2010),[11] runs (115), slugging percentage (.613), and total bases (367). 
He also came in second in OBP, and third in hits (201), and tied for eighth 
in stolen bases. He also had a 20-game hitting streak.[11] Defensively, 
he had the best range factor of all third basemen in the league (3.32), 
and led it in assists (338) and double plays (38). He batted .336, and 
missed winning the batting title – and with it the Triple Crown – on the 
last day of the season, by just over one percentage point. He was elected 
American League MVP by a unanimous vote, the first to be elected unanimously 
since the original "Hebrew Hammer", Hank Greenberg.[13] In Bill James' 
New Historical Baseball Abstract, Rosen's 1953 season is called the greatest 
ever by a third baseman.[citation needed] It is ranked 164th overall,[14] 
and 48th best by a position player[15] by Baseball-Reference.com as of 
Rosen's passing. In 1954 he hit an even .300, led the league in sacrifice 
flies with 11, was fourth in SP (.506), and fifth in home runs (24), RBI 
(102), and OBP (.404). He also hit consecutive home runs in the All-Star 
game despite a broken finger, earning him the game MVP. His five RBI in 
the game matched the record set by Ted Williams five years earlier, which 
still stood through the 2011 season.[16] Hall of Fame manager Casey Stengel 
said of him: "That young feller, that feller's a ball player. He'll give 
you the works every time. Gets all the hits, gives you the hard tag in 
the field. That feller's a real competitor, you bet your sweet curse life."[17] 
Cleveland won the pennant, but lost the World Series. In spite of Rosen's 
5th straight year with 100 or more RBIs Cleveland cut his $42,500 ($375,100 
today) salary to $37,500 ($331,800 today) for 1955. In 1955 Rosen finished 
in the top ten in the league in at-bats per home run, walks, and sacrifice 
flies. By 1956, back problems and leg injuries caught up with Rosen and 
he retired at age 32 at the end of the season.[18] After retiring in 1956 
Rosen became a stockbroker,[19] an occupation he pursued for the next twenty-two 
years.[20] In 1978 he became President/CEO of the Yankees (1978–79),[20] 
then the Astros (1980–85), then president and general manager of the Giants 
(1985–92). His maneuvering brought San Francisco from last place in 1985 
to the NL West title in 1987 and the NL pennant in 1989, earning him the 
National League Executive of the Year honors.[21] Regarded as a GM who 
still thought like a player, he became the only MVP in history to also 
earn the top executive award.[1] In 1979, Al appeared with the then-General 
Manager of the San Francisco Giants, Spec Richardson, in a television commercial 
entitled "Baseball Executives" for Miller Lite, as one of the commercials 
in the legendary "Great Taste, Less Filling" advertising campaign. The 
idea was two major league high-level baseball executives are discussing 
a big trade in a formal, stuffy members only club...and at the end of the 
spot we realize they are actually trading baseball cards like a couple 
of kids, as they throw down a bunch of baseball cards on the polished wooden 
table. The commercial ran heavily during the summer of 1979 and on every 
game of the 7 game Pirates-Orioles World Series that year. The commercial 
was created by the advertising agency McCann-Erickson, and was conceived 
and written by agency writer Peter Hoffman. It was directed by Bob Giraldi. 
Rosen's wife of 19 years, the former Teresa Ann Blumberg, died on May 3, 
1971. He remarried, to second wife, Rita (née Kallman), several years later. 
He has three sons, and a stepson and stepdaughter. Rosen occasionally consulted 
for baseball teams, including a stint with the Yankees as special assistant 
to the general manager in 2001 and 2002. He was featured in the 2010 movie 
narrated by Dustin Hoffman, Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story.[3] 
Rosen died on March 13, 2015 in Rancho Mirage, California.[22][23] Rosen 
was tough, an amateur boxer, and had a reputation for standing up to anyone 
who dared insult his ancestry. While some reports have him commenting that, 
as a minor leaguer, he wished his name were something less obviously Jewish, 
he is later known to have remarked that he wished it were more Jewish—something 
like Rosenstein.[24][25] When Ed Sullivan, himself a Catholic with a Jewish 
wife, suggested that Rosen might be Catholic, pointing to his habit of 
drawing a "cross" in the dirt with his bat, Rosen said the mark was an 
"x" and told Sullivan he wished his name were more Jewish so he wouldn't 
be mistaken for Catholic.[3][24] Once a White Sox opponent called him a 
"Jew bastard". Sox pitcher Saul Rogovin, also Jewish, remembered an angry 
Rosen striding belligerently to the dugout and challenging the "son of 
a bitch" to a fight. The player backed down.[26] Rosen challenged another 
opposing player who had "slurred [his] religion" to fight him under the 
stands. And during a game, when Red Sox bench player Matt Batts taunted 
Rosen with anti-Semitic names, Rosen called time and left his position 
on the field to confront Batts.[25] Hank Greenberg recalled that Rosen 
"want[ed] to go into the stands and murder" fans who hurled anti-Semitic 
insults at him. A 2010 documentary, Jews and Baseball: An American Love 
Story, highlighted Rosen, who in it is frank about how he dealt with anti-Semitism: 
"There's a time that you let it be known that enough is enough. . . . You 
flatten [them]."[27] During his career, Rosen refused to play on the High 
Holy Days, as would baseball Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax, arguably the most 
famous American Jewish baseball player. In a 1976 Esquire magazine article, 
sportswriter Harry Stein published an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter", 
consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Rosen was the third baseman on 
Stein's Jewish team. Through 2014, he was fifth in career home runs (behind 
Sid Gordon), seventh in RBIs (behind Ryan Braun), and tenth in hits (behind 
Mike Lieberthal) among all-time Jewish major league baseball players.[28]
