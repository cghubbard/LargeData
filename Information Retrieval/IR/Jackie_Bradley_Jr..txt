Jackie Bradley Jr. (born April 19, 1990), is an American professional baseball 
center fielder who currently plays for the Boston Red Sox of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He was drafted by the Red Sox with the 40th overall pick 
in the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft after being named the 2010 College 
World Series Most Outstanding Player while attending the University of 
South Carolina. Bradley began his college career in 2009 after attending 
Prince George High School in Prince George, Virginia. Prior to attending 
college, he had been named to the 2008 Virginia AAA All-State team and 
was listed as the 40th-best Virginia-based baseball prospect for the 2008 
Major League Baseball draft by Baseball America.[1] With the University 
of South Carolina in 2009, Bradley hit .349 and scored 69 runs in 63 games. 
Posting a slugging percentage of .537, he hit 11 home runs while walking 
34 times and striking out 31 times. He spent the summer in the Cape Cod 
League with the Hyannis Mets. In 2010 he batted .368 and 13 home runs, 
driving in 60 runs while scoring 56 times in 67 games. Then, he went 10-for-29 
at the plate in the 2010 College World Series, earning CWS Most Outstanding 
Player honors. Bradley was selected 40th overall by the Boston Red Sox 
in the supplemental first round of the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft. 
Bradley made his professional debut on August 23, 2011 with the Class-A 
Short Season Lowell Spinners, hitting .250 in 10 games split between the 
Spinners and Single-A Greenville Drive. Bradley was named Minor League 
Defensive Player of the Year by the Red Sox organization for the 2012 season. 
He hit .315 with 55 extra-base hits, 87 walks, and 63 RBIs in 128 games.[2] 
Entering 2013, Bradley ranked 32nd overall on the MLB.com Top 100 Prospects 
list.[3] After an outstanding spring training, on March 31, manager John 
Farrell announced that Bradley would be the Opening Day left fielder on 
April 1 at Yankee Stadium.[4] Although he went hitless in two at-bats, 
Bradley had three walks, scored two runs, drove in one run, and made a 
couple of hustle plays on the basepath and in the field in the Red Sox' 
8–2 win over the Yankees.[5] Bradley went 3-for-31 with three RBIs in Boston 
before being optioned to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox on April 19; Bradley 
was demoted to accommodate David Ortiz, who started the 2013 season on 
a rehab assignment, recovering from a right Achilles injury. Bradley was 
recalled on May 29. He hit his first career home run on June 4 against 
the Texas Rangers.[6] Bradley was optioned back to Pawtucket on June 8 
when Shane Victorino was activated from the disabled list. He was recalled 
again on July 9, and optioned back to Pawtucket on July 14. He was recalled 
on September 7.[7] In 37 Major League games of 2013, Bradley batted .189 
with 3 home runs, 10 RBI, and 2 stolen bases. With the Red Sox finishing 
97–65, the team made the postseason and eventually won the World Series 
over the St. Louis Cardinals. Bradley still received his first career championship 
ring, although he did not play in the postseason. On March 28, 2014, Bradley 
was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket after he was unable to beat Grady Sizemore 
for the starting center field position, but was recalled three days later 
after the team placed Shane Victorino on the 15-day disabled list. Bradley 
saw regular time as the team's center fielder throughout the 2014 season, 
but was optioned back to Triple-A Pawtucket on August 18 after hitting 
just .216 with one home run and 30 RBI, despite playing exceptional defense.[8] 
On June 25, 2015, Bradley was called back up to play right field for the 
Red Sox while Hanley Ramirez recuperated with a sore wrist.[9] In a June 
30 game against the Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Marco Estrada, he hit his 
first home run since May 31, 2014. On August 15, 2015, Bradley became only 
the eighth player in the modern era with five extra-base hits in one game, 
recording two home runs and three doubles in six at-bats, in the Red Sox' 
22–10 defeat of the Seattle Mariners. His play led to a starting job and 
widespread speculation that he would be part of the full-time Red Sox outfield 
in 2016 and beyond.[10][11] Between April 24th and May 25th, Bradley hit 
safely in 29 straight games, tying Johnny Damon for the 4th longest consecutive 
game hitting streak in Boston Red Sox history. His streak came to an end 
in a loss to the Colorado Rockies on May 26. He ended the 2016 season with 
a .267 batting average Bradley Jr. is the son of Jackie Bradley Sr., a 
bus driver in Richmond, Virginia.[12] Bradley Jr. is married to Erin Helring;[13] 
their daughter Emerson was born in 2016. Both Bradley Jr. and Bradley Sr. 
were named for singer Jackie Wilson.[12] Before each at bat, Bradley writes 
"M.S." in the dirt in honor of his friend Matt Saye who died in a car accident. 
Bradley, who was close with Saye, said, "You never know what the next day 
will bring, if there is a next day. This really all came to me after my 
best friend passed away in August. He was like a brother to me. In his 
obituary, I was mentioned as his only surviving brother. And he was a different 
race (white). That's how close we were. I know he has my back and he's
