The Montreal Expos joined the National League in 1969, along with the San 
Diego Padres, with a majority share held by Charles Bronfman, a major shareholder 
in Seagram. Named after the Expo 67 World's Fair, the Expos' initial home 
was Jarry Park. Managed by Gene Mauch, the team lost 110 games in their 
first season, coincidentally matching the Padres inaugural win-loss record, 
and continued to struggle during their first decade with sub-.500 seasons. 
Starting in 1977, the team's home venue was Montreal's Olympic Stadium, 
built for the 1976 Summer Olympics. Two years later, the team won a franchise-high 
95 games, finishing second in the National League East. The Expos began 
the 1980s with a core group of young players, including catcher Gary Carter, 
outfielders Tim Raines and Andre Dawson, third baseman Tim Wallach, and 
pitchers Steve Rogers and Bill Gullickson. The team won its only division 
championship in the strike-shortened split season of 1981, ending its season 
with a three games to two loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National 
League Championship Series. The team spent most of the 1980s in the middle 
of the NL East pack, finishing in third or fourth place in eight out of 
nine seasons from 1982 to 1990. Buck Rodgers was hired as manager before 
the 1985 season and guided the Expos to a .500 or better record five times 
in six years, with the highlight coming in 1987, when they won 91 games. 
They finished third, but were just four games behind the division-winning 
Cardinals. Bronfman sold the team to a consortium of owners in 1991, with 
Claude Brochu as the managing general partner.[1][2] Rodgers, at that time 
second only to Gene Mauch in number of Expos games managed, was replaced 
partway through the 1991 season. In May 1992, Felipe Alou, a member of 
the Expos organization since 1976, was promoted to field manager, becoming 
the first Dominican-born manager in MLB history.[1] Alou would become the 
leader in Expos games managed, while guiding the team to winning records, 
including 1994, when the Expos, led by a talented group of players including 
Larry Walker, Moisés Alou, Marquis Grissom and Pedro Martínez, had the 
best record in the major leagues until the 1994–95 Major League Baseball 
strike forced the cancellation of the remainder of the season. After the 
disappointment of 1994, Expos management began shedding its key players, 
and the team's fan support dwindled. Brochu sold control of the team to 
Jeffrey Loria in 1999,[3][4] but Loria failed to close on a plan to build 
a new downtown ballpark, and did not reach an agreement on television and 
English radio broadcast contracts for the 2000 season, reducing the team's 
media coverage. In November 2001, Major League Baseball's owners voted 
28–2 to contract the league by two teams — according to various sources, 
the Expos and the Minnesota Twins, both of which reportedly voted against 
contraction.[5] Subsequently, the Boston Red Sox were sold to a partnership 
led by John W. Henry, owner of the Florida Marlins.[5][6] In order to clear 
the way for Henry's group to assume ownership of the Red Sox, Henry sold 
the Marlins to Loria, and baseball purchased the Expos from Loria.[5] However, 
as the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, operator of the Metrodome, 
won an injunction requiring the Twins to play there in 2002,[5] MLB was 
unable to revoke the Twins franchise, and so had to keep the Twins and 
Expos as part of the regular season schedule. In the collective bargaining 
agreement signed with the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) 
in August 2002, contraction was prohibited through to the end of the contract 
in 2006.[7] With contraction no longer an option for the immediate term, 
MLB began looking for a relocation site for the Expos. Some of the choices 
included Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Washington, D.C.; San Juan, Puerto Rico; 
Monterrey, Mexico; Portland, Oregon; somewhere in Northern Virginia such 
as Arlington or Dulles; Norfolk, Virginia; Las Vegas; and Charlotte, North 
Carolina. Washington and Virginia emerged as the front-runners. In both 
2003 and 2004, the Expos played 22 of their home games in San Juan, Puerto 
Rico at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium, and the remaining 59 in Montreal. On 
September 29, 2004, MLB announced that the Expos would move to Washington, 
D.C. in 2005.[8][9] The Expos played their final game on October 3 at Shea 
Stadium, losing by a score of 8–1 against the New York Mets, the same opponent 
that the Expos first faced at its start, 35 years earlier. On November 
15, a lawsuit by the former team owners against MLB and former majority 
owner Jeffrey Loria was struck down by arbitrators, bringing to an end 
all legal actions that would impede a move. The owners of the other MLB 
teams approved the move to Washington in a 28–1 vote on December 3 (Baltimore 
Orioles owner Peter Angelos cast the sole dissenting vote). Numerous professional 
baseball teams have called Washington, D.C. home. The Washington Senators, 
a founding member of the American League, played in the nation's capital 
from 1901 to 1960 before moving to Minnesota and becoming the Twins. These 
Senators were owned by Clark Griffith and played in Griffith Stadium. With 
notable stars including Walter Johnson and Joe Cronin, the Senators won 
the 1924 World Series and pennants in 1925 and 1933, but were more often 
unsuccessful and moved to Minnesota for the 1961 season where the team 
was renamed the Minnesota Twins. A second Washington Senators team (1961–1971) 
had a winning record only once in their 11 years, though bright spots, 
such as slugger Frank Howard, earned the love of fans. The second Senators 
team moved to Arlington, Texas, for the 1972 season and changed their name 
to the Texas Rangers, and Washington spent the next 33 years without a 
baseball team. Although there was some sentiment to revive the name Senators, 
political considerations factored into the choice of Nationals, a revival 
of the first American League franchise's "official" nickname used from 
1905 to 1956.[10] Politicians and others in the District of Columbia objected 
to the name Senators because the District of Columbia does not have voting 
representation in Congress.[11] In addition, the Rangers still owned the 
rights to the Senators name,[12] although the Nationals were able to acquire 
the rights to the curly "W" from the Rangers. Washington, D.C., mayor Anthony 
A. Williams supported the name "Washington Grays", in honor of the Negro-league 
team the Homestead Grays (1929–1950), which had been based in Pittsburgh, 
but played many of their home games in Washington. In the end, the team 
owners chose the name "Washington Nationals", which had been the official 
name of the American League's Washington Senators from 1905–1956. The move 
was announced despite opposition from Peter Angelos, owner of the nearby 
Baltimore Orioles, who infamously announced "There are no baseball fans 
in Washington, D.C. That's a fiction." Since 1972, the Orioles had been 
the only MLB franchise in the Baltimore–Washington Metropolitan Area, which 
he considered a single market. Angelos contended that the Orioles would 
suffer financially if another team were allowed to enter the market, although 
the Orioles and the Washington Senators had shared the market successfully 
from 1954 through 1971, and four other major metropolitan areas (New York, 
Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco Bay Area) of roughly comparable 
size to Baltimore-Washington each have two MLB teams (in all cases, one 
each in the National and American Leagues). This reasoning disturbed many 
in Washington who recalled that it was the Griffith family, owners of the 
Washington Senators, who allowed the St. Louis Browns to move to Baltimore 
and become the Orioles in 1954 in the first place. On March 31, 2005, Angelos 
and Major League Baseball struck a deal to protect the Orioles against 
any financial harm the Nationals might present. Under the terms of the 
deal, television and radio broadcast rights to Nationals games are handled 
by the Orioles franchise, which formed a new network (the Mid-Atlantic 
Sports Network) to produce and distribute the games for both franchises 
on both local affiliates and cable/satellite systems. MASN was not, however, 
immediately available on all cable providers, adding to the frustration 
of Nationals fans. In fact, most in the DC area missed almost the entirety 
of the Nationals' first two seasons. The deal with Angelos makes the Nationals 
the only major league baseball team that does not own its own broadcast 
rights. The team's relocation to Washington was contingent on a financing 
plan for the Nationals' new stadium—this plan quickly became the subject 
of much debate on the Council of the District of Columbia. Three Council 
members who supported Mayor Anthony Williams's plan were ousted in September 
2004's Democratic party primary. In addition, an opinion poll conducted 
by The Washington Post during the peak of the controversy found that approximately 
two-thirds of District residents opposed the mayor's stadium plan. Much 
of the controversy centered on the fact that the city would be helping 
finance a $581 million stadium without support from Maryland or Virginia 
or their counties, from which a large portion of the team's fan base would 
be drawn.[13] In December 2004, the move to Washington itself was called 
into doubt when the D.C. Council sought to change details of the stadium's 
financing. When the Council voted on December 14, 2004 to require 50 percent 
private financing for any new stadium, MLB ceased promotional activities 
for the Nationals and announced that they would consider looking for a 
new market. Eventually, the council passed an amended plan on December 
21, 2004 that proved slightly more financially favorable to the city, while 
remaining acceptable to MLB. Mayor Williams signed the stadium financing 
package on December 30. During the 2005 season, a private financing plan 
for construction of the stadium was negotiated between the city and a syndicate 
of bankers led by Deutsche Bank. The negotiations of the details ran into 
another problem in November 2005. The bankers requested a letter of credit 
or other financial guarantee of $24 million, $6 million for each of four 
years, insuring payment of lease revenues against various risks including 
poor attendance and terrorism. The city requested that Major League Baseball 
provide this guarantee, which they were unwilling to do. On December 22, 
2005, the Washington Post reported that Major League Baseball had specifically 
instructed prospective owners not to offer to pay cost overruns on the 
stadium if they were selected as the owners. Bidders were also told not 
to communicate with the press about these issues. In February 2006, the 
DC City Council imposed a $611 million cap on the stadium. Finally, on 
March 5, Major League Baseball signed a lease for a new ballpark, agreeing 
to the city's $611 million cap. MLB also agreed to contribute $20 million 
toward the cost of the stadium, although it did not agree to cover stadium 
overruns. Further, MLB added the condition that excess ballpark tax revenue 
earmarked for debt service for the bonds be available for cost overruns. 
Two days later, on March 7 the DC City Council, by a vote of 9–4, approved 
a construction contract for a state-of-the-art stadium with a contemporary 
glass-and-stone facade, seats for 41,000 fans and a view of the U.S. Capitol, 
and affirmed its demand that public spending on the project be limited 
to $611 million. The votes were the final actions needed to satisfy the 
terms of the deal struck in September 2004, paving the way for the sale 
of the team. Major League Baseball had agreed at the time that the franchise 
was moved to Washington to sell the team to an owner or ownership syndicate. 
Several dates for sale of the team were set and missed due to the legal 
wrangling regarding the building of the stadium. The delay was harshly 
criticized by city residents and leaders as reported in The Washington 
Post. Selecting from a finalized group of three potential ownership syndicates, 
Major League Baseball announced in July 2006 that it had chosen the Lerner 
Enterprises group, led by billionaire real estate developer Theodore N. 
Lerner. The final sale price of the team was $450 million and the transfer 
of ownership was completed July 24, 2006. In late September 2006, Comcast 
finally agreed to broadcast the Nationals games. When Ted Lerner took over 
the club in mid-2006, he hired Stan Kasten as team president. Kasten was 
widely known as the architect of the Atlanta Braves before and during their 
run of 14 division titles (a streak only interrupted by the strike season 
of 1994, when the Braves ended the season behind the Montreal Expos – ironically, 
the Nationals' predecessor). Kasten was also the general manager or president 
of many other Atlanta-area sports teams, including the Atlanta Hawks and 
Atlanta Thrashers. "The Plan", as it became known, was a long-range rebuilding 
and restructuring of the team from the ground up. This plan included investing 
in the farm system and the draft, and having a suitable team to go along 
with their new stadium. In the front office, the Nationals hired the well-respected 
former Arizona scouting director Mike Rizzo to be the vice president of 
baseball operations, second in charge under then-general manager Jim Bowden.[14] 
At the end of the 2006 season, the Nationals did not re-sign free agent 
and star OF Alfonso Soriano. Soriano signed a $136 million contract with 
the Cubs, and Washington received two draft picks in return. OF José Guillén 
was also allowed to depart via free agency, and another high draft pick 
was obtained. Another high priced player, 2B/DH José Vidro, was traded 
to the Seattle Mariners for prospects OF Chris Snelling and RHP Emiliano 
Fruto. In mid-2006, the Nationals received OF Austin Kearns, 2B/SS Felipe 
López, and RHP Ryan Wagner from the Cincinnati Reds, giving up LHP Gary 
Majewski, LHP Bill Bray, SS Royce Clayton, 2B Brendan Harris and RHP Daryl 
Thompson. In August, they traded RHP Liván Hernández to the Arizona Diamondbacks 
for prospects LHP Matt Chico and RHP Garrett Mock. Other players traded 
or let go from the 2005 season were OF Preston Wilson, RHP Héctor Carrasco, 
IF Jamey Carroll, and OF Terrmel Sledge. The team also acquired pitching 
prospects Luis Atilano from Atlanta, Shairon Martis from San Francisco 
and Jhonny Núñez from the Dodgers. In 2006, they had two first-round draft 
picks, OF Chris Marrero, and RHP Colten Williams, and signed them both 
to developmental contracts. The Nationals also signed a 16-year-old Dominican 
shortstop, Esmailyn Gonzalez, for $1.4 million.[15] Gonzalez was later 
revealed to be 20 years old at the time of his signing.[16] As for their 
farm system, the Nationals had a lot of work to do. By the spring of 2007, 
Baseball America had ranked the Nationals organization as dead last twice 
in four years in terms of minor league talent.[17] The Nationals had five 
of the first seventy picks in the 2007 Major League Baseball draft: their 
own two, and three compensation picks (two from losing Soriano, and one 
for Guillen). The team selected players that many considered to be four 
of the top 30 players available.[17] Overall, the Nationals signed all 
of their top twenty draft picks.[18] One of them, a first-round supplemental 
pick, Michael Burgess, was, by the end of the year, picked by Baseball 
America as the top prospect for the entire Gulf Coast League.[19] Their 
rookie team, Vermont, sent three starting pitchers Colton Willems, Glenn 
Gibson, and Adrian Alaniz, and two position players, first baseman Bill 
Rhinehart, and outfielder Aaron Seuss to the New York–Penn League All-Star 
Game.[20] By the end of the season, three Vermont pitchers landed in the 
Top 20 prospects for the New York–Penn League: In the low-A South Atlantic 
League Top 20, two players made the list: In addition, after having no 
teams in the Dominican Summer League, the Nationals fielded two clubs in 
2007, one of which won the DSL Championships.[23] In March 2009, just prior 
to Spring training, members of the Nationals' front office were implicated 
in a scandal involving the skimming of bonus money from the signing of 
Latin American players. José Rijo, a key adviser to Jim Bowden, was thought 
to be at the heart of this. As a result of this scandal, General Manager 
Jim Bowden resigned in Spring training of 2009, though he maintained he 
had done nothing wrong.[24] Mike Rizzo, the man serving as assistant G.M. 
for the previous two seasons, became the acting GM. Rizzo began to shape 
the team in a way that was contrary to Bowden's previous methods. While 
Bowden was known for "dumpster-diving", that is attempting to find serviceable 
players among the less-than-desired, Mike Rizzo sought players who achieved 
results. Bowden took risks on players with poor reputations (such as outfielders 
Elijah Dukes and Lastings Milledge), while Rizzo made a point out of making 
certain his players possessed "character" and would contribute to a cohesive 
clubhouse. Despite the failures of Bowden's tenure, his last trade appeared 
to have been extremely beneficial to the Nationals, as he traded infielder 
Emilio Bonifacio and two minor-leaguers to the Marlins for starting pitcher 
Scott Olsen and outfielder Josh Willingham. Rizzo's first major trade during 
the 2009 season as General Manager of the Nationals was to trade Lastings 
Milledge along with control-challenged reliever Joel Hanrahan to the Pirates 
in exchange for speedy outfielder Nyjer Morgan and left-handed relief pitcher 
Sean Burnett. Morgan was thought to be a great clubhouse presence as well 
as a slick fielder on the outfield grass. Mike Rizzo's new philosophy continued 
to show in the 2009–2010 offseason. He was able to acquire second baseman 
Adam Kennedy, All Star starting pitcher Jason Marquis (who began the 2010 
season very poorly, though it was later revealed that he had bone chips 
in his throwing elbow, his ERA was over 13 at one point), and catcher Ivan 
"Pudge" Rodriguez. All three men had reputations as being great teammates. 
Collectively, they had extensive experience playing for successful teams. 
This was a contrast to the Nationals' roster at the time, which had some 
talented players who lacked experience playing for winning teams. After 
losing four starters (Liván Hernández, Tony Armas, Ramón Ortiz and Pedro 
Astacio) from the prior year, the Nationals invited an extraordinary 36 
pitchers to spring training.[25][26] On Opening Day, the Nationals lost 
their starting shortstop Cristian Guzmán and center fielder Nook Logan 
for five weeks due to injuries. At the end of April, starting pitcher Jerome 
Williams hurt his ankle while batting and was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list. Then, in the space of just 10 days in May, Shawn Hill, John Patterson, 
and Jason Bergmann went on the disabled list. Jerome Williams returned, 
pitched one game, and went back on the DL with a shoulder injury. The Washington 
Post's wrote: "Almost everything that could sink a team's attitude has 
befallen the Nationals. They started the year 1–8, then they lost eight 
in a row to drop to 9–25."[27] They put journeymen Mike Bacsik, Micah Bowie, 
Tim Redding, and Jason Simontacchi, along with rookie reliever Levale Speigner 
into the starting rotation, amidst predictions that the 2007 Nationals 
might equal the 1962 Mets' record of futility of 120 losses in one season.[28] 
But the Nationals bounced back, going 24–18 in their next 42 games through 
June 25. But on that day, a day in which Bergman made his first start off 
the DL, the Nationals received the news that shortstop Cristian Guzmán, 
their leadoff hitter (and second on the team with a .329 batting average) 
was lost for the rest of the season due to a thumb injury he had received 
the day before tagging out a runner. The Nationals finished the 2007 season 
73–89, improving their record by two more wins than in 2006. On June 23, 
2011, the Nationals won a 1-0 game to put them above .500 with a record 
of 38-37 (.507), the latest point in the season the team had been above 
.500 since 2005. Immediately after the game, manager Jim Riggleman resigned, 
citing the team's refusal to discuss extending his contract.[43] Bench 
coach John McLaren was named the interim manager.[44] It was later reported 
that Davey Johnson was signed through the end of the 2011 season, with 
an option for 2012 (as a candidate in a search that would include minority 
candidates), and a contract as a front office consultant through 2013.[45] 
The Nationals finished the 2011 season in third place with a record of 
80-81, their second-best record since they moved to Washington.[46] They 
only played 161 games because a home game against the Dodgers was cancelled 
due to rain. The game was not made up because it was inconsequential to 
the playoffs with no room on the schedule to play it.[47] On December 23, 
Washington traded prospects A.J. Cole, Derek Norris, Tom Milone and Brad 
Peacock for All-Star Pitcher Gio Gonzalez.[48] After the 2011 season, the 
last remaining member of the Expos – Liván Hernández – departed the Nationals, 
although his association with the team was non-continuous. On September 
20, the Nationals beat the Los Angeles Dodgers to clinch a spot in the 
playoffs and became the first Washington-based baseball team to advance 
to the postseason in 79 years.[49] On October 1, the Nationals clinched 
the National League East division[50] and later clinched the best record 
in Major League Baseball at 98-64.[51] However, the team lost to the St. 
Louis Cardinals in the NLDS 3 games to 2.[52] In November 2012, manager 
Davey Johnson signed a contract to return for the 2013 season, and announced 
that he would retire from managing at the end of that season.[53] It is 
believed that the Nationals will likely leave the team's current spring 
training home at Space Coast Stadium in Viera, Florida once the lease expires 
in 2017 (although an early exit is possible in 2015).[54] On October 31, 
2013, the Nationals announced the hiring of Matt Williams to replace Davey 
Johnson as the team's manager for the 2014 season.[55][56] The Nationals 
clinched the NL East on September 16, 2014, after beating the Atlanta Braves.[57] 
Jordan Zimmermann pitched the Nationals' first no-hitter (since moving 
from Montreal in 2005) on the last day of the 2014 regular season, September 
28, 2014, against the Miami Marlins. The Nationals started their season 
in a skid, falling to the bottom of their division. On April 28, 2015, 
after a seven-game losing streak, with rookie starting pitcher A. J. Cole 
on the mound, the Nationals found themselves in at a nine-run deficit against 
their archrival, the Atlanta Braves. But the team clawed back to win the 
game 13-12, overcoming their largest run deficit ever.[58] Over the coming 
weeks, the Nationals rebounded from their poor start to the season, rising 
to the top of the division behind a career-best season for outfielder Bryce 
Harper.[59][60] On June 20, 2015, the Nationals shut out the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, with Max Scherzer throwing a no-hitter that was nearly perfect. 
The game was the second no-hitter in Nationals history.[61] Scherzer became 
the first pitcher since Nolan Ryan in 1973 to throw two no-hitters in the 
regular season, shutting down the New York Mets on October 3, 2015, in 
a performance that also equaled Ryan's historic mark of 17 strikeouts in 
a no-hitter.[62][63] However, the Mets won the division, clinching it in
