Claude Judson "Chaucer" Elliott (November 17, 1876 – June 21, 1923) was 
a professional baseball player. He was a right-handed pitcher over parts 
of two seasons (1904–1905) with the Cincinnati Reds and New York Giants. 
For his career, he compiled an 3–3 record in 22 appearances, with an 3.33 
earned run average and 47 strikeouts. He was a member of the 1905 World 
Series champions Giants, though he did not play in the World Series. In

was Elliot who flied out ending the top of the ninth inning with Graham 
on deck.[3] Elliott was born and later died in Pardeeville, Wisconsin at
