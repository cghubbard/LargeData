The Lancaster JetHawks are a minor league baseball team of the California 
League located in Lancaster, California. The team is named for the city's 
association with the aerospace industry and plays its home games at The 
Hangar. The Lancaster JetHawks are the Class A-Advanced affiliate of the 
Colorado Rockies. The JetHawks are the only California League team in Los 
Angeles County. The team was founded as the Silver Sox in Reno in 1947, 
where they played as a Class C Team until 1951. In 1955, they were revived 
as a Class A team, and continued playing in Reno until moving to Riverside 
to become the Pilots in 1993. They made the move to Lancaster in 1996. 
Notable players to play for the JetHawks include José Cruz, Jr. and Brandon 
Webb. While in Riverside, the team played at UC-Riverside Sports Center. 
The Pilots' previous owners chose Lancaster over Palm Springs, California 
in a lucrative offer. In November 2005, the original owners of the JetHawks 
during their first 10 years in Lancaster, Clutch Play Baseball, LLC, sold 
the team to a group led by majority investor Peter Carfagna of Cleveland, 
Ohio. One of their first acts was to replace the stadium's original scoreboard 
with a more advanced video board. For the first time, this allowed for 
video replays and other views from cameras around the field. For the 2006 
season, the JetHawks' manager was former major leaguer Brett Butler. On 
September 29, 2006, the Boston Red Sox announced a two-year affiliation 
agreement with the JetHawks after losing their previous Carolina League 
affiliation in Wilmington. Since the Fenway Sports Group purchased the 
Carolina League's Salem Avalanche franchise after the 2007 season, with 
the stated intent of moving the Red Sox's High-A affiliation there once 
the 2007–2008 agreement term expired, the JetHawks were forced to find 
a new major league affiliate before the 2009 season—the Houston Astros. 
On August 25, 2008, the JetHawks announced its new General Manager, Antelope 
Valley native Larry Thornhill. Thornhill, a former JetHawks broadcaster 
from its inaugural season of 1996, took over day-to-day operations of the 
Lancaster organization from Brad Seymour who was promoted to Vice President 
of both the JetHawks and Lake County Captains. Seymour joined the organization 
in 2004 and served as General Manager for five seasons with the JetHawks. 
Wes Clemente, after serving the 2009 season as the JetHawks' manager, took 
over the managerial position for the Corpus Christi Hooks, Houston's Double-A 
affiliate. On November 16, 2009, the JetHawks announced its new manager 
for the 2010 season, Tom Lawless. He served as the manager of the Lexington 
Legends, the Astros' Class A minor league team, for the 2009 season. The 
JetHawks concluded the 2010 season with a 54–86 record, setting the worst 
season mark in franchise history. The JetHawks have been lauded for their 
creative giveaways. Every season, they give away a NASA-related bobblehead 
to pay tribute to the Antelope Valley and its leading industry. The Buzz 
Aldrin bobblehead was a big hit. On July 12, 2008, the JetHawks gave away 
skateboards to the first 500 children to arrive at the ballpark. These 
skateboards were widely considered the most expensive and high-end giveaway 
of the season in minor league baseball. Minor League Baseball (MILB.com) 
rated the skateboard giveaway one of the top ten promotions of 2008 in 
the minor leagues. On December 9, 2010, Tom Spencer was named as the JetHawks' 
manager for the 2011 season. He served as the manager of the Palm Beach 
Cardinals, the Advanced A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals, for the 
2009 season. On May 26, 2011, the Lancaster JetHawks announced that Larry 
Thornhill had resigned his position as Vice President and General Manager 
of the franchise for personal reasons. Derek Sharp, Lancaster's Assistant 
General Manager who has been with the organization since 2008, was named 
Interim General Manager for the remainder of the 2011 California League 
season. Brad Seymour, who was the JetHawks General Manager from 2004 – 
2008, had also been named Senior Consultant for the JetHawks. Seymour currently 
also serves as Vice President and General Manager of the Lake County (OH) 
Captains, Class A affiliate of the Cleveland Indians under the direction 
of the Peter A. Carfagna ownership group which also controls the Lancaster 
JetHawks. Seymour, along with team President Peter E. Carfagna, will have 
direct oversight of the day-to-day activities of the JetHawks. On September 
7, 2011, Derek Sharp was promoted from Interim General Manager to General 
Manager. On January 3, 2012, Rodney Linares was named as the JetHawks' 
manager for the 2012 season. He served as the manager of the Lexington 
Legends, the Class A affiliate of the Houston Astros, for the 2011 season. 
The Lancaster JetHawks clinched a playoff berth after the 2012 season as 
the #2 seed Wild Card. In the Southern Division Mini-Series, the JetHawks 
beat the Lake Elsinore Storm, two games to one. In the Southern Division 
Championship Series, the JetHawks beat the First & Second Half Champion 
High Desert Mavericks, three games to one. On September 15, 2012, the Lancaster 
JetHawks became the California League Champions after sweeping the Northern 
Division Champion Modesto Nuts three games to none with a final score in 
Game 3 of 3–2. It would be the JetHawks’ first California League Championship 
title in franchise history. On May 12, 2013 (Mother's Day), the Lancaster 
JetHawks beat the Stockton Ports, 2–0, as Kyle Hallock and Luis Cruz combined 
to throw the first nine-inning no-hitter in franchise history. The win 
was also JetHawks manager Rodney Linares' 300th career win as a manager. 
The only other no-hitter in JetHawks history came in 2010 when they no-hit 
the Lake Elsinore Storm in a combined 10-inning no-hitter. Robert Donovan, 
Edwin Walker, David Berner, David Carpenter, and Jose Trinidad pitched 
in the game for the JetHawks. The Lancaster JetHawks clinched a playoff 
berth after the 2013 season as the First and Second Half Champions. On 
December 20, 2013, Will Thornhill, son of former general manager Larry 
Thornhill, was named the new general manager of the Lancaster JetHawks 
after Derek Sharp accepted a job with the New Britain Rock Cats, the Double 
A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. On April 29, 2014, Lance McCullers 
and Kyle Smith combined to tie a Lancaster franchise record with 17 strikeouts 
against the High Desert Mavericks. The record was set on August 8, 1997 
when then Mariners' farmhand Jason Bond struck out 14 batters and the bullpen 
fanned three at Recreation Park against the Visalia Oaks. On May 13, 2014, 
Josh Hader, J. D. Osborne, and Daniel Minor combined to throw the third 
no-hitter in franchise history as the JetHawks beat the Bakersfield Blaze, 
1-0, at The Hangar. On June 5, 2014, designated hitter Dan Gulbransen doubled 
to lead of the eighth inning to complete the sixth cycle of JetHawks history 
in a 16-7 win over the Inland Empire 66ers at The Hangar. Gulbransen became 
the first JetHawk to hit for the cycle since Brandon Barnes and Freddy 
Parejo hit for the cycle on back-to-back days on June 8 and 9, 2010. On 
June 11, 2014, the Lancaster JetHawks clinched the 2014 South Division 
First Half Championship title with a 16-3 win over the Rancho Cucamonga 
Quakes at The Hangar. The feat marks the sixth time the JetHawks have won 
the first half title in franchise history and the first time they've won 
back-to-back first halves since 2007 and 2008 as a Boston Red Sox affiliate. 
With three games remaining before the first half of the season concluded, 
the JetHawks tied the franchise record for first half wins with forty-three 
that was set back in 2004. On June 13, 2014, the JetHawks set a new franchise 
record for first half wins with 44 with a 7-4 win over the Rancho Cucamonga 
Quakes at The Hangar. The Lancaster JetHawks clinched a playoff spot as 
the First Half Champions after the 2014 season. In the Southern Division 
Championship Series, the JetHawks swept the Second Half Champion Inland 
Empire 66ers, three games to none. On September 15, 2014, the Lancaster 
JetHawks became the California League Champions after beating the Northern 
Division Champion Visalia Rawhide three games to two with a final score 
in Game 5 of 10-2. It would be the JetHawks' second California League Championship 
title in franchise history, achieved on the two-year anniversary of their 
first and second title in three seasons. On November 12, 2014, Ballpark 
Digest.com announced the Lancaster JetHawks were being sold by Peter A. 
Carfagna's ownership group to the ownership group headed by Jake Kerr and 
Jeff Mooney, current owners of the Vancouver Canadians. Upon closing, Kerr 
and Mooney will become the third ownership group in the JetHawks' 19-year 
history. The sale is expected to close by the end of the calendar year, 
after receiving approvals by the California League and Minor League Baseball 
and a review by Major League Baseball.[1] On December 19, 2014, the Lancaster 
JetHawks announced their Field Staff for the 2015 season with Omar Lopez 
replacing Rodney Linares as JetHawks' skipper after three successful seasons 
that included two California League Championships (2012, 2014) and one 
California League Manager of the Year Award (2013). Lopez joins the JetHawks 
for his first season as manager and his 17th overall with the Astros organization. 
As manager of the Class A Quad Cities River Bandits in 2013, Lopez led 
the club to the Midwest League Championship title after an 81-57 finish 
in the regular season. Rodney Linares will take over as 2015 manager of 
the Double-A Corpus Christi Hooks. On January 15, 2015, Tom Backemeyer 
was announced to have been appointed Executive Vice President of the Lancaster 
JetHawks in advance of the 2015 season effective January 6, 2015. The native 
of Lincoln, Nebraska has a vast background in Minor League Baseball as 
prior to his arrival in Lancaster, Backemeyer helped develop franchises 
in Nashville, Rancho Cucumonga, Fresno, and in Everett where he was named 
Executive Vice President of the Aquasox of the Northwest League. A graduate 
of Colorado State University (BA) with an MBA from University of Denver, 
Backemeyer has developed into one of Minor League Baseball's bright young 
minds as he joins the JetHawks organization. The Lancaster JetHawks clinched 
a playoff berth after the 2015 season as the #2 seed Wild Card. In the 
Southern Division Mini-Series, the High Desert Mavericks beat the JetHawks, 
two games to one. The Lancaster JetHawks clinched a playoff spot as the 
Second Half Champions after the 2016 season, making it five straight playoff 
appearances. In the Southern Division Mini-Series, the JetHawks beat the 
Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, two games to one. In the Southern Division Championship 
Series, the JetHawks lost to the First Half Champion High Desert Mavericks, 
three games to one. The JetHawks play home games at The Hangar which opened 
in 1996 as Lancaster Municipal Stadium. The Hangar has just over 4,600 
permanent seats, but can accommodate over 7,000 fans with grass seating 
along each foul line. The stadium has deep fences (350 feet (110 m) down 
the right and left field lines and 410 feet (120 m) to deep center field) 
to combat the prevailing winds of the Antelope Valley. Known now by its 
nickname "The Hangar" after the signage of Clear Channel Stadium (2005–2012) 
was removed during the 2012 season, the stadium has a NASA F/A-18 Hornet 
mounted on display at the front entrance. On December 19, 2010, Ballpark 
Digest reported that the Lancaster JetHawks are expected to save some green 
– to the tune of $48K – this coming season after the installation of solar 
panels on a ballpark carport will supply 98% of The Hangar's electricity 
needs on a typical game night. The installation is part of a citywide emphasis 
on solar energy from civic structures. At the ballpark, 1,500 solar panels 
will be installed on a 700-foot-long carport beside the ballpark, well 
outside of foul-ball range. The electricity generated by the 340-kilowatt 
panel system will supply 98% of the power needed to run the ballpark, including 
the ballpark lights, and should save the owners of the JetHawks some $48,000 
per year in utility costs. "The entire Lancaster community has embraced 
the city's mission to become the alternative energy capital of the world, 
and as the first minor league team in California to go solar, we’re happy 
to do our part", said JetHawks owner Peter Carfagna. On August 27, 2009, 
the Lancaster JetHawks created the Community Sports Network (CSN @ JetHawks.com), 
an internet radio station that brings almost two hundred games and thousands 
of hours of local sports talk coverage to the Antelope Valley each year. 
The creation was in response to several local radio stations in the Antelope 
Valley eliminating their high school and college radio coverage. The station 
streams live on the internet 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with all 
local sports coverage. The station also offers live play-by-play coverage 
of Lancaster JetHawks baseball, Antelope Valley College football and basketball, 
and a high school football and basketball game of the week, all accessible 
through the JetHawks' website. The free service launched on Saturday, September 
5, 2009 at 6 PM with an hour-long pre-game show leading up to dual coverage 
of the Lancaster JetHawks game against the Inland Empire 66ers of San Bernardino 
and the Antelope Valley College Marauders football opener on the road against 
College of the Canyons. As of the 2010 season, the Lancaster JetHawks have 
a new radio station and a new web home to broadcast every inning of JetHawks 
baseball. The team partnered with News Talk 1380, a High Desert Broadcasting 
station, which will carry every JetHawks game, including the regular season 
and playoffs. Launched in September 2009, CSN@JetHawks.com will stream 
all broadcasts live as well as offering special replays of events. Jeff 
Lasky, JetHawks' play-by-play broadcaster since the 2006 season, will once 
again be calling the action while being joined by newcomer Scott Blusiewicz. 
On February 17, 2012, the Lancaster JetHawks announced its return to New 
Talk 1380 AM and a new voice for the 2012 season. The High Desert Broadcasting 
station with take over the play-by-play action live all season with Jason 
Schwartz, a Los Angeles native and University of Southern California graduate 
who was the voice of the Northwest League's Tri-City Dust Devils, Class 
A Short Season affiliate of the Colorado Rockies, for their 2011 season. 
A live stream of each game will also be broadcast online at JetHawks.com. 
The JetHawks Clubhouse Show, a weekly talk show, will continue to air every 
Wednesday at 5 PM (PST) on air and online at JetHawks.com. Since the 1996 
inaugural season, KaBoom (KB for short) has been the JetHawks' mascot. 
In the 2008 season, he introduced an all-new look as part of his team's 
complete image makeover. KB entertains fans at games and participates in 
contests between innings. He can often be seen walking around the stadium 
planning his next stunt. KaBoom also encourages children in Antelope Valley 
schools to read with his own KaBoom's Reading Challenge. Before the 2009 
season on March 21, 2009, KaBoom celebrated his 13th birthday at a party 
held in his honor at Clear Channel Stadium, where he revealed his younger 
brother, Stealth, to JetHawks fans. From 2009 to 2011, the JetHawks reintroduced 
the all new Hawkettes, a dance team that helps pass out giveaways at the 
main gate, toss JetHawks and Astros merchandise into the stands, and demonstrate 
their dancing abilities with their own dance routines, along with KaBoom, 
between innings. The team previously appeared at the ballpark during the 
1996 inaugural season. Paying homage to the city's association with the 
aerospace industry, the Lancaster JetHawks started the Astronaut Race at 
the start of the 2015 season. During each home game, three mascots of former 
NASA astronauts John Glenn, Pete Knight, and Neil Armstrong participate 
in a foot race from in front of the right field fence to in front of the 
visitor's dugout on the third base side. Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders
