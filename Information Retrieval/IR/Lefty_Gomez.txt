Vernon Louis "Lefty" Gomez (November 26, 1908 – February 17, 1989) was 
an American professional baseball player. A left-handed pitcher, Gomez 
played in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1930 and 1943 for the New 
York Yankees and the Washington Senators. Gomez was a five-time World Series 
champion with the Yankees. He was also known for his colorful personality 
and humor throughout his career and life. Gomez grew up in California and 
played for the San Francisco Seals after high school. He made his MLB debut 
with the Yankees in April 1930. He was selected as an All-Star every year 
between 1933 and 1939. He sustained an arm injury in 1940. Though he rebounded 
well in 1941, he pitched his last full season in 1942, then appeared in 
one game in 1943 before retiring with the Washington Senators. In 1933, 
Gomez married June O'Dea, who had a brief career as a Broadway actress. 
After his retirement, he became a popular public speaker. Gomez was elected 
to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1972. 
He made an appearance at Yankee Stadium in 1987, when he and Whitey Ford 
were honored with plaques at the stadium's Monument Park. He died in California 
in 1989. Gomez was born in Rodeo, California. His father, Francisco Gomez, 
had been born in California to a Spanish father, Juan Gomez, and a Portuguese 
mother, Rita. His mother, Lizzie Herring, was an American of Welsh-Irish 
descent.[1] He played sandlot baseball in Oakland while attending Richmond 
High School and was recruited by the San Francisco Seals.[2] The New York 
Yankees purchased Gomez from the Seals for an estimated $39,000.[3] Gomez 
made his major league debut on April 29, 1930. He pitched in only 15 games 
and finished the season with a 2-5 win-loss record, a 5.55 earned run average 
(ERA). Coming into the 1931 season, Gomez had good pitching velocity, but 
the Yankees were concerned about the pitcher's slender frame of 6 feet 
2 inches (1.88 m) and 155 pounds (70 kg). Following a common medical strategy 
of the time, the team had most of his teeth extracted; they also had him 
drink three quarts of milk daily and gave him an unlimited meal allowance 
for road games. Gomez registered the second-best ERA in the American League 
in 1931.[4] A 20-game winner four times and an All-Star every year from 
1933 to 1939, Gomez led the league twice each in wins, winning percentage 
and ERA; he was a three-time league leader in shutouts and strikeouts. 
In the first major league All-Star Game (July 6, 1933), Gomez was the winning 
pitcher for the American League (AL) and drove in the first run of the 
game. This was out of character for him; he was notorious for poor hitting 
even by AL standards. Late in life, Gomez commented, "I never even broke 
a bat until last year when I was backing out of the garage."[5] His career 
OPS+ of -7 is the fifth-worst in baseball history among players with at 
least 1,000 plate appearances.[6] Gomez holds the record for the most innings 
pitched in a single All-Star game (six, in 1934). Lefty's best season came 
in 1934, when he won 26 games and lost just five. In both 1934 and 1937, 
he won pitching's "Triple Crown" by leading the league in wins, ERA and 
strikeouts; he also led the AL both seasons in shutouts. His .649 career 
winning percentage ranks 15th in major league history among pitchers with 
200 or more decisions. Among pitchers who made their MLB debuts from 1900 
to 1950, only Lefty Grove, Christy Mathewson and Whitey Ford have both 
more victories and a higher winning percentage than Gomez. Gomez won six 
World Series games without a loss, a career World Series record. He won 
a World Series game in 1932, two in 1936, two in 1937 and one in 1938. 
He also set a World Series record by receiving two walks in the same inning 
on October 6, 1937.[7] Nicknamed "El Goofo" and "Goofy Gomez", he was known 
for his sense of humor, even on the field. In one game, he came up to bat 
when it was slightly foggy. Bob Feller was on the mound and Gomez struck 
a match before stepping into the batter's box. "What's the big idea?" asked 
the umpire. "Do you think that match will help you see Feller's fast one?" 
Gomez replied, "No, I'm not concerned about that. I just want to make sure 
he can see me!" Another time, a reporter asked the noted brushback pitcher, 
"Is it true that you'd throw at your own mother?" Gomez replied, "You're 
damn right I would. She's a good hitter." Gomez also often remarked, "I'd 
rather be lucky than good."[5] In 1940, Gomez suffered an arm injury, which 
left him up for grabs by another team, but in 1941 he played fairly well, 
winning 15 and losing 5. During that season, he was said to be a great 
starting pitcher, but won through the support of Johnny Murphy, who relieved 
him in later innings. After the 1942 season ended, Gomez took a job as 
a dispatcher with the General Electric River Works, a defense plant in 
Lynn, Massachusetts, which only paid $40 a week. Then on January 27, 1943, 
the Yankees sold him to the Boston Braves for $10,000.[3] Gomez never appeared 
in a game with the Braves, as later in the year he was released from his 
contract and signed with the Washington Senators. He pitched just one game 
― on May 30, 1943, allowing four hits, four runs and walking five men ― 
before pulling a shoulder muscle in the fifth inning and retiring from 
baseball. He had a 189–102 career record with 1,468 strikeouts and a 3.34 
ERA in 2503 innings pitched. On February 26, 1933,[8] Gomez married June 
O’Dea (1912–1992).[9] A Broadway headliner who starred in Of Thee I Sing, 
she gave up her career in 1936. By 1937 the marriage was on shaky ground. 
Gomez traveled to Hollywood that April and June returned to Massachusetts 
to stay with family. Through the tabloids, she learned in December that 
Gomez was filing divorce papers in Mexico, charging incompatibility. Being 
a devout Catholic, June refused a divorce but agreed to a formal separation, 
citing abandonment and cruel and inhuman treatment.[10] Publicly, Gomez 
said the whole idea of divorce was absurd, but after the first of the year 
he moved to Reno to get a six-week divorce. It was his intention for the 
divorce to be finalized by the time he began spring training in Florida.[11] 
Separation proceedings continued for months, but were called off in May 
1938.[12] Gomez and O'Dea had two daughters and two sons.[13] In retirement, 
Gomez became a sought-after dinner speaker known for his humorous anecdotes 
about his playing days and the personalities he knew. He was a bit of a 
screwball, nicknamed "El Goofo" or "Goofy Gomez"[1] (a likewise-alliterative 
counterpart to his contemporary, Dizzy Dean), and delighted in playing 
practical jokes on everyone from teammates to umpires. On February 2, 1972, 
the Veterans Committee unanimously inducted Gomez into the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame, along with Giants outfielder Ross Youngs and former American 
League President Will Harridge. The Committee noted that Lefty pitched 
in seven World Series games with no losses and five wins. Wearing a Yankee 
cap, Gomez became the second player of Hispanic descent to be inducted. 
The 1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was dedicated to Gomez as 
he was the last surviving player from the 1933 All-Star Game. He also threw 
out the ceremonial first pitch. On August 2, 1987, he and Whitey Ford were 
honored with plaques to be placed in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. Gomez's 
plaque says he was "Noted for his wit and his fastball, as he was fast 
with a quip and a pitch." Despite advancing age, he was able to attend 
the ceremony. Although he was honored with the plaque, his uniform #11 
has not been retired, and has since been worn by several Yankees including 
Joe Page, Johnny Sain, Héctor López, Fred Stanley, Dwight Gooden, Chuck 
Knoblauch, Gary Sheffield, Doug Mientkiewicz, and Brett Gardner. Gomez 
spent the last years of his life in Novato, California, and he died of 
congestive heart failure on February 17, 1989, in Marin General Hospital 
in Larkspur, California.[13] A decade later, he was ranked #73 on The Sporting 
News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,[14] and was a nominee for
