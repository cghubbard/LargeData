Rahway and Union Township. Portions of the township were taken to form 
Cranford (March 14, 1871), Linden Borough (March 30, 1882) and Roselle 
(December 20, 1894). Linden was incorporated as a city by an act of the 
New Jersey Legislature on January 1, 1925, replacing both Linden Township 
and Linden Borough, based on the results of a referendum held on November 
8, 1923.[21] The city's name derives from linden trees brought from Germany.[22]

the Bayway Refinery, a Phillips 66 refining facility that helps supply 
petroleum-based products to the New York/New Jersey area, producing approximately 
230,000 barrels per day (37,000 m3/d), making it the second-largest on 
the East Coast of the United States and one of the country's 25 largest 
facilities.[36] In the mid-20th century, Linden was the headquarters for 
the Regal Records and De Luxe Records labels, as well as the budget record 
label Springboard International Records later in the century.[citation

Motors manufacturing plant that produced Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick and 
other GM automobiles, but also produced planes during World War II.[37] 
As of Spring of 2008 most of the plant has been torn down for redevelopment 
by Duke Realty Corporation, which purchased the 100 acres (40 ha) site 
for $76.5 million.[38] Linden, together with Rahway, is home to Merck & 
Co., one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies. In 2003, the

as mayor of Linden for 30, non-consecutive years until December 31, 2006,

Cosby-Hurling, who represents the Fifth Ward, became the first African 
American female elected to the City Council when she took office in 2011.[62]
