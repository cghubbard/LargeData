Red, Yellow           The Louisville Colonels were a Major League Baseball 
team that played in the American Association (AA) throughout that league's 
ten-year existence from 1882 until 1891. They were known as the Louisville 
Eclipse from 1882–1884, and as the Louisville Colonels from 1885 to 1891. 
The latter name derived from the historic Kentucky colonels. After the 
AA folded in 1891, the Colonels joined the National League and played through 
the 1899 season. "Colonels" was also the name of several minor league baseball 
teams that played in Louisville, Kentucky, in the 20th century. After spending 
several years as a well-known semi-pro team, the Eclipse joined the new 
American Association in 1882. The team's backer, local distiller J. H. 
Pank, was named vice-president of the AA, and the team was to be run by 
a consortium led by W. L. Lyons. Accompanying them to the major leagues 
was their star player, infielder Pete Browning, who had already achieved 
some measure of local fame. The team got off to a good start, finishing 
in second place that first season. That would be their best finish for 
several seasons. Ownership troubles were also afoot, as managing partner 
Lyons resigned in mid-1888, with team secretary Mordecai Davidson taking 
over. The following season, the team sank to a 27–111 record and a last 
place finish, and Davidson surrendered control of the team to the AA. A 
rare feat was made in the 1896 season when the Colonels lost five straight 
games in two days, including a tripleheader on September 7 and a doubleheader 
the next day, all against the Baltimore Orioles. With the prohibition of 
triple headers in the early 1920s, this record stands permanent. Three 
years later, the 1889 Colonels were the first team in major-league history 
to lose 100 games in a season. The next season, the team, which had been 
purchased by Barney Dreyfuss, would bounce back with a vengeance. The Colonels 
won the 1890 pennant in the AA, during a season in which the league was 
considered only the third-best behind the NL and the Players' League, and 
appeared in an early version of the World Series which resulted in three 
wins for each team. Following up on their last place finish the previous 
year, they became the one and only team to rise from the cellar to the 
pennant in one season. In 1892 the team moved to the National League when 
the original, major league American Association dissolved, and played there 
until 1899. In 1900 Dreyfuss acquired controlling interest of the Pirates 
and brought 14 Colonels players with him, including future Hall of Famers 
Honus Wagner and Fred Clarke, marking the end of the original Colonels 
organization and Louisville as a Major League Baseball host city. In September 
1882, Louisville pitchers threw two no-hitters in the span of nine days; 
Tony Mullane on Sept. 11, followed by Guy Hecker on Sept. 19. Other Louisville 
pitchers who threw no-hitters were Ben Sanders on August 22, 1892, and 
Deacon Phillippe, a rookie, on May 25, 1899. Pete Browning hit for the 
cycle twice for Louisville, on Aug. 8, 1886 and June 7, 1889. * – denotes
