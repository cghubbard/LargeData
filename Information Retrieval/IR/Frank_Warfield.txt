Francis Xavier Warfield (April 26, 1897 â€“ July 24, 1932) was an infielder 
and manager in the Negro leagues. Standing at just 5'7", Warfield was known 
primarily for his fielding and baserunning excellence, but he also had 
several good years at the plate. In 1922, he hit .342 for the Detroit Stars. 
He played on the Hilldale teams that won the Eastern Colored League pennants 
from 1923 to 1925. Warfield became player-manager of the Baltimore Black 
Sox in 1929 and led them to the Negro American League championship. He 
and teammates Oliver Marcelle, Dick Lundy, and Jud Wilson became known 
as the "Million Dollar Infield" because their collective talents may have 
been worth $1,000,000 to the major leagues had they been white. Baseball 
writer Bill James ranked Warfield as the eighth-greatest second baseman 
in negro league history, calling him a "complete defensive wizard".[3] 
Warfield was known to have a violent nature that led to arguments, and 
he once bit off part of Oliver Marcelle's nose in a fight over a dice game.[4]
