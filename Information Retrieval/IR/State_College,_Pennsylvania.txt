State College is a home rule municipality in Centre County in the Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania. It is the largest designated borough in Pennsylvania.[3] 
It is the principal borough of the six municipalities that make up the 
State College Metropolitan Statistical Area, the largest settlement in 
Centre County and one of the principal cities of the greater State College-DuBois 
Combined Statistical Area with a combined population of 236,577 as of the 
2010 United States Census. In the 2010 census, the borough population was 
42,034 with approximately 105,000 living in the borough plus the surrounding 
townships often referred to locally as the "Centre Region." Many of these 
Centre Region communities also carry a "State College, PA" address although 
are not part of the borough of State College.[3] State College is a college 
town, dominated economically and demographically by the presence of the 
University Park campus of the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State). 
Though "Happy Valley" is another often-used term to refer to the State 
College area, the term also includes the borough and the townships of College, 
Harris, Patton, and Ferguson. In 2013, State College was ranked as the 
third-safest metropolitan area in the United States by the CQ Press.[4] 
In 2016, State College was ranked the 8th best college town in the nation 
by Best College Reviews.[5] State College evolved from a village to a town 
in order to serve the needs of the Pennsylvania State College, founded 
as the Farmers' High School of Pennsylvania in 1855. State College was 
incorporated as a borough on August 29, 1896, and has grown with the college, 
which was renamed The Pennsylvania State University in 1953. In 1973 State 
College adopted a home rule charter which took effect in 1976;[6] since 
that time, it has not been governed by the state's Borough Code, although 
it retains "Borough of State College" as its official name. The university 
has a post office address of University Park, Pennsylvania. When Penn State 
changed its name from College to University in 1953, its president, Milton 
S. Eisenhower, sought to persuade the town to change its name as well.[citation 
needed] A referendum failed to yield a majority for any of the choices 
for a new name, and so the town remains State College. After this, Penn 
State requested a new name for its on-campus post office in the HUB-Robeson 
Center from the U.S. Post Office Department. The post office, which has 
since moved across an alley to the McAllister Building, is the official 
home of ZIP code 16802 (University Park). State College is situated at 
an elevation of approximately 1,200 feet (370 m) above sea level.[7] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 4.5 
square miles (12 km2), all of it land. It is surrounded by large tracts 
of farmland, and an expanse of mountains and forests.[citation needed] 
State College has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa). Temperatures 
average 27.2 °F (−2.7 °C) in January and 72.1 °F (22.3 °C) in July. Annual 
precipitation averages 39.8 inches (101 cm), with 45.9 inches (117 cm) 
of annual snowfall on average.[8] With a period of record dating back to 
1893, the lowest temperature recorded was −20 °F (−29 °C) on February 10, 
1899 and the highest was 102 °F (39 °C) on July 17, 1988 and July 9, 1936. 
According to the 2010 census,[14] there are 42,034 people, 12,610 households, 
and 3,069 families residing in the borough. The population density was 
9,258.6 people per square mile (3,574.3/km²). There were 13,007 housing 
units at an average density of 2,865.0 per square mile (1,106.0/km²). The

0.2% Native American, 9.8% Asian, 1.0% Other, and 2.0% from two or more 
races. 3.9% of the population were of Hispanic or Latino ancestry. 22,681

of age or older. The average household size was 2.30 and the average family

by its student population, was 5.1% under the age of 18, 70.6% from 18 
to 24, 13.1% from 25 to 44, 6.5% from 45 to 64, and 4.7% who were 65 years

and 9.8% of families are below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 
10.6% of those under the age of 18 and 2.2% of those 65 and older are living 
below the poverty line. However, traditional measures of income and poverty 
can be very misleading when applied to a community like State College which 
is dominated by students. The population of the State College Metropolitan 
Statistical Area was 153,990 in the 2010 U.S. census. Pennsylvania State 
University is the largest single employer in the region, employing over

year pave the way to February's THON weekend. Blue-White Football Weekend 
occurs in April and includes a carnival, fireworks, food vendors, the student 
entertainment stage, live music, a parade, and more.[18] On game day, an 
autograph session with the football student-athletes is held in Beaver 
Stadium, prior to kickoff of the Blue-White football intrasquad scrimmage 
game. Some of the other popular annual events in the area include "First 
Night State College", a New Year's Eve celebration with carved ice sculptures

Penn State Nittany Lions football which draws over 100,000 fans to Beaver 
Stadium on home games.[19] The borough itself is home to the State College 
Spikes, a minor league baseball team. The team is part of the New York–Penn 
League and has played in Medlar Field at Lubrano Park, also home to Penn 
State baseball, since 2006.[citation needed] Jeffrey Field is a soccer 
specific stadium in State College, Pennsylvania that is home to both the
