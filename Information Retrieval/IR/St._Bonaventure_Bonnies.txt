The St. Bonaventure Bonnies (formerly the St. Bonaventure Brown Indians, 
from 1927 to 1992[2]) are the varsity intercollegiate athletic programs 
of St. Bonaventure University, based in Allegany, New York, United States. 
The Bonnies compete in the National Collegiate Athletics Association's 
Division I Atlantic 10 Conference,[3] of which it has been a member since 
1979.[4] The school's athletic director is Tim Kenney, who was hired in 
early 2015.[5] The programs' mascot is the Bona Wolf and colors are brown 
and white.[6] A member of the Atlantic 10 Conference, St. Bonaventure University 
sponsors teams in seven men's and seven women's NCAA sanctioned sports:[7] 
Men's Intercollegiate Sports Women's Intercollegiate Sports In addition, 
the Bonnies field an ice hockey team in the American Collegiate Hockey 
Association ("club" level hockey). The hockey Bonnies play at the William 
O. Smith Recreation Center in Olean and are members of the Northeast Collegiate 
Hockey League, primarily playing other area colleges' second-tier club 
squads. The men's basketball program has enjoyed success on and off throughout 
its history, including an NCAA Final Four appearance in 1970,[8] and an 
NIT Championship in 1977.[9] St. Bonaventure's most recent NCAA Tournament 
appearance was in 2012, a 66–63 loss to Florida State. Currently, St. Bonaventure's 
head men's basketball coach is Mark Schmidt.[10] NBA Hall of Famer Bob 
Lanier played at St. Bonaventure, leading them to the 1970 Final Four.[8] 
The men's and women's basketball teams play at the 6,012-seat Reilly Center.[11] 
The playing surface was renamed Bob Lanier Court in a dedication ceremony 
on October 12, 2007. Lanier attended along with his mother, sister, and 
daughter.[12] The Bonnies men's golf team is coached by John Powers, a 
2010 graduate of Bowling Green University. Powers took over the team in 
the summer of 2011.[13] The team hosts the annual Leo Keenan Invitational 
at Bartlett Country Club in Olean, New York, where it has been held since 
the late 1980s.[14] In the 2011–2012 season, the Bonnies women's basketball 
team had the best season in their history. They accumulated a record of 
31–4 in the regular season, including a perfect 14–0 record in the Atlantic 
10 conference. They were ranked as high as 16th in the national polls and 
earned a 5th seed in the NCAA Tournament. They beat Florida Gulf Coast 
and Marist in the Tallahassee Regional to advance to the Sweet 16, where 
they lost to eventual national runner-up Notre Dame. St. Bonaventure fielded 
an American football team sporadically from 1895–1970. The Brown Indians 
had a wrestling team in 1927, led by player-coach Ed George,[15] and again 
in 1954, coached by Mike Green. They were winless each season, going 0–2 
in 1927 and 0–1 in 1954. Due to their lopsided loss to Alfred Ag Tech in 
1954, they discontinued the sport.[16] The school's current mascot is the 
Bona Wolf, the third mascot in school history.[6] From 1927–1992, St. Bonaventure's 
mascot was the Brown Indian. As part of an ongoing debate over Native American 
mascots, however, this was changed to the Bona Fanatic.[17] This new mascot 
was poorly received, so much so that costume wearers were assaulted by 
St. Bonaventure fans. After only a few years (1996–1998) in existence, 
the Fanatic was dropped in favor of the current Bona Wolf.[18] The school's 
colors, brown and white, reflect the colors of Franciscan friar robes. 
The university is closely affiliated with this religious order.[19] Source:[20] 
The school fight song is "Unfurl the Brown and White".[29] The song was 
written by St. Bonaventure graduates L.G. O'Brien (Class of 1925) and C.R.
