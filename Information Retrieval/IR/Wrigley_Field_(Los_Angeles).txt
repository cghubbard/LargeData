Not to be confused with Chicago's Wrigley Field. Wrigley Field was a ballpark 
in Los Angeles which served as host to minor league baseball teams in the 
region for over 30 years, and was the home park for the Los Angeles Angels 
of the Pacific Coast League as well as a current major league team, the 
later Los Angeles Angels, in their inaugural season, 1961. The park was 
designed by Zachary Taylor Davis, who had previously designed both Chicago 
ballparks: Comiskey Park and Wrigley Field.[2] The ballpark was also used 
as the backdrop for several Hollywood films about baseball, as well as 
TV series such as Home Run Derby. Called Wrigley's "Million Dollar Palace", 
Wrigley Field was built in South Los Angeles in 1925, and was named after 
William Wrigley Jr., the chewing gum magnate.[1] Wrigley owned the first 
tenants, the original Los Angeles Angels, a Pacific Coast League team and 
their parent club the Chicago Cubs. In 1925, the Angels moved from their 
former home at Washington Park, which was also known as Chutes Park. Wrigley's 
Major League home (Wrigley Field) in north Chicago was named for him later, 
in 1927. Wrigley Field in Los Angeles was built to resemble Spanish-style 
architecture and a somewhat scaled-down version of the Chicago ballpark 
(known then as Cubs Park) as it looked at the time. It was also the first 
of the two ballparks to bear Wrigley's name, as the Chicago park was named 
for Wrigley over a year after the L.A. park's opening. At the time, he 
owned Santa Catalina Island, and the Cubs were holding their spring training 
in that island's city of Avalon (whose ball field was located on Avalon 
Canyon Road and also informally known as "Wrigley Field"). Coincidentally, 
one of Wrigley Field's boundary streets was Avalon Boulevard (east, behind 
right field and a small parking lot). The other boundaries of the block 
were 41st Street (north, behind left field), 42nd Place (south, behind 
first base), and San Pedro Street (west, behind third base and a larger 
parking lot). Not only did L.A. Wrigley get its name first, it had more 
on-site parking than the Chicago version did (or does now). Lights were 
added to the original park in 1930.[1] For 33 seasons, 1925 to 1957, the 
park was home to the Angels, who were a farm team of the Chicago Cubs from 
1921–56. For 11 seasons, (1926–1935, 1938) the park was also the home of 
another PCL team, the Hollywood Stars. In 1930, the Angels and Stars combined 
to draw over 850,000 fans, more than the two Major League teams in St. 
Louis (Browns and Cardinals) drew that season.[1] The Stars eventually 
moved to their own new ballpark, Gilmore Field, just west of the Pan Pacific 
Auditorium. Angel players of note included future Dodgers Manager and Hall 
of Fame member Tommy Lasorda, future Phillies, Twins and Angels Manager 
Gene Mauch, actor Chuck Connors, Gene Baker and Andy Pafko. The parent 
club, Chicago Cubs were the first Major League team to play at Wrigley, 
when they played the Angels in a Spring training game in 1926.[1] Years 
later, on March 20, 1949, The Major League Cubs played the defending World 
Champion Cleveland Indians in a spring training game before 24,517.[1] 
On February 21, 1957, the Dodgers bought Wrigley Field, the Angels franchise 
and their territorial rights for $3 million (as well as a team in Fort 
Worth, Texas).[1] L.A. Wrigley's minor league baseball days then ended 
when the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National League transferred to Los Angeles 
in 1958. The Pacific Coast League Angels franchise were forced to relocate, 
ending up in Spokane, Washington.[3] The use of Wrigley, and enlarging 
it was studied by the Dodgers.[4] They also looked at playing in the Rose 
Bowl in Pasadena, California and the Los Angeles Coliseum.[1] The Dodgers 
opted for seating capacity over suitability as a baseball field, and instead 
set up shop for four seasons in the 93,000-seat Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum[5] 
(which had a 251-foot (77 m) foul line in left field) while awaiting construction 
of the baseball-only Dodger Stadium, which has a set capacity of 56,000.[6][7] 
The decision to play at the Coliseum was vindicated when the Dodgers won 
the 1959 World Series over the Chicago White Sox, with all three games 
played at the Coliseum attracting over 92,000 fans including the World 
Series single game attendance record of 92,706 for game 5 of the series. 
In October, 1960, Major League Baseball added two teams, expanding the 
American League from 8 to 10 teams. Teams were awarded to Los Angeles and 
Washington, D.C.. The Los Angeles franchise was awarded to Gene Autry and 
Bob Reynolds. The team was again called the Los Angeles Angels.[1] In 1961 
the MLB L.A. Angels began play and, by agreement, took residence at Wrigley 
for its inaugural season.[8] The agreement had been criticized, with the 
Dodgers playing the 1961 season at the nearby Coliseum. Wrigley Field had 
been considered an "abandoned minor league stadium" in a "declining neighborhood" 
with "terrible parking".[9] The Home Opener was April 27, a 4-2 loss to 
the Minnesota Twins before a crowd of only 11,931.[1][10] Future President 
Richard Nixon and Casey Stengel were in attendance, along with Ford Frick, 
Joe Cronin and Ty Cobb.[1] In the last Major League game played at Wrigley, 
on October 1, 1961, Cleveland beat the Angels 8-5 before 9,868 fans. Steve 
Bilko hit the last home run in Wrigley.[11] The Angels set a still-standing 
first-season expansion-team record with 71 wins finishing 71-91. Thanks 
to its cozy power alleys,[12] the park became the setting for a real-life 
version of Home Run Derby, setting another record by yielding 248 home 
runs; that 248 mark stood for over 30 years. The 1961 Angels were led in 
hitting by Lee Thomas, .284; in home runs by Leon Wagner, 28 and RBI by 
Ken Hunt, 84. The pitching staff was led by Ken McBride with 12 wins. Future 
World Series winning manager Chuck Tanner played in 7 games.[13] The team 
drew 603,510 fans.[14] In 1962, the Angels moved to the new Dodger Stadium 
(or "Chavez Ravine", as it was known for Angels games) for four seasons 
until Anaheim Stadium opened in 1966. The new Dodger Stadium also "took 
over" for Wrigley Field, as the site of choice for Hollywood filming that 
required a ballpark setting. Wrigley was used frequently for boxing. Six 
world title boxing bouts were held there, including the 1939 Joe Louis-Jack 
Roper fight. Sugar Ray Robinson also boxed at Wrigley Field. Robinson won 
the Middleweight Championship on May 18, 1956, knocking out of Carl Olson 
before 18,000 fans.[1][15] On August 18, 1958, in a Heavyweight Championship 
fight, Floyd Patterson defeated Roy Harris with 17,000 in attendance.[1] 
After the completion of the 1938 season, The first NFL Pro Bowl was held 
at Wrigley Field on January 13, 1939.[15] Sammy Baugh was among those on 
the rosters that matched the Champion New York Giants against All-Star 
NFL players.[16] The Pepperdine Waves football team played Home games at 
Wrigley Field in 1948. On May 28, 1959, the park hosted the USA–England 
soccer friendly where England won 8-1 in front of 13,000 [1]. Being closer 
to Hollywood than the other major league baseball fields at the dawn of 
motion pictures, Wrigley Field was a popular place to film baseball movies. 
The first film known to have used Wrigley as a shooting location was 1927's 
Babe Comes Home, a silent film starring Babe Ruth. Some well-known movies 
filmed there were The Pride of the Yankees and the movie version of the 
stage play Damn Yankees. When Frank Capra filmed the public rally scene 
at Wrigley for "Meet John Doe" in August 1940,[17] massive sprinklers simulated 
a downpour because the director included one rainy scene in each movie 
as good luck.[18] The film noir classic Armored Car Robbery had its title 
heist set at Wrigley. The ballpark later found its way into television, 
serving as the backdrop for the Home Run Derby series in 1960, a popular 
show filmed in 1959 which featured one-on-one contests between baseball's 
top home run hitters, which had a revival in 1989 when it aired on ESPN,[19] 
and later on ESPN Classic. Episodes of shows as diverse as The Twilight 
Zone ("The Mighty Casey", 1960), Mannix ("To Catch a Rabbit", 1969) and 
The Munsters ("Herman the Rookie", 1965) were also filmed there. Some closeups 
were filmed there for insertion into the 1951 film Angels in the Outfield, 
a film otherwise set at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh. A 1932 movie short 
starring Babe Ruth titled Just Pals was also filmed at Wrigley Field. Following 
the Angels' departure, there were no regular tenants at Wrigley Field after 
1961. By then the park was owned by the city, and various events were staged. 
On May 26, 1963, a large crowd attended a civil rights rally featuring 
Martin Luther King, Jr. By 1966 the park was being used for soccer matches 
and the like. Demolition began in March 1969, to make way for a new recreation 
facility called Gilbert Lindsay Park. The park has a ball field in the 
northwest corner of the property, which was once a parking area. The diamond 
is locally known as "Wrigley Field", and is the home of Wrigley Little 
League baseball and softball.[20] The original site of the Wrigley diamond 
and grandstand is occupied by the Kedren Community Mental Health Center 
and another parking lot. The ballpark's dimensions were cozy but symmetrical, 
giving a nearly equal chance to right and left-handed batters in the Home 
Run Derby series. The only difference was that the left field wall was 
14.5 feet (4.4 m) high, whereas the right field fence was only 9 feet (2.7 m)
