Harvey Willos "Hub" Walker (August 17, 1906 – November 26, 1982) was a 
Major League Baseball outfielder who played five seasons with the Detroit 
Tigers (1931, 1935, 1945) and Cincinnati Reds (1936–1937). Born in Gulfport, 
Mississippi, Walker was the brother of Major League player, Gee Walker. 
Hub and his younger brother, Gee, were teammates both at the University 
of Mississippi and with the Detroit Tigers in 1931 and 1935. Hub Walker 
played in 297 Major League games, 211 in the outfield. Walker had a career 
. 263 batting average with a .354 on-base percentage. Brother Gee Walker 
played for the Tigers in their 1935 World Series championship, and Hub 
played for the Tigers a decade late in their 1945 World Series championship. 
Hub Walker joined the Detroit Tigers late in the 1945 season after serving 
three years in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Having had only 32 plate 
appearances, Walker was ineligible for the World Series, but MLB Commissioner 
Happy Chandler waived the rules to allow the returning World War II veteran 
to play in the Series. Walker played in two games of the 1945 World Series 
for the Tigers, getting a double and scoring a run in two World Series 
at bats as a pinch hitter. Walker also played in the minor leagues for 
the Minneapolis Millers and Toledo Mudhens. Hub Walkler died in 1982 at 
age 76 in San Jose, California.[1] Hub Walker donated his papers to the 
University of Mississippi Library. The papers available there include correspondence, 
photographs, scrapbooks, and a notebook of World War II reminiscences.[2]
