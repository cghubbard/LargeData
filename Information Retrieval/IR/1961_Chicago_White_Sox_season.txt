The 1961 Chicago White Sox season was the team's 61st season in the major 
leagues, and its 62nd season overall. They finished with a record 86â€“76, 
good enough for fourth place in the American League, 23 games behind the 
first-place New York Yankees. Their pitching staff surrendered 13 of Roger 
Maris's 61 home runs that year, the most of any team. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
