Jay Campbell Buhner (born August 13, 1964), nicknamed "Bone", is a former 
Major League Baseball right fielder. At 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) and 220 lb (100 kg), 
he was among the most recognizable players of his day, noted for his shaved 
head, thick goatee, and patch of pine tar on the right hip of his uniform. 
Born in Louisville, Kentucky, Buhner was raised in Texas and attended Clear 
Creek High School in League City, southeast of Houston, where he played 
baseball under coach Jim Mallory. His nickname "Bone" came then, when he 
lost a ball in the lights which hit him in the skull, and shook it off. 
The coach came out to see if he was OK, and commented it was a good thing 
Buhner had such a bony head, and the name stuck.[1] He graduated in 1982 
and played college baseball at McLennan Community College in Waco. In his 
freshman season in 1983, the Highlanders made their fourth consecutive 
trip to the junior college world series in Grand Junction, Colorado, and 
won their only national title.[2] He was selected by the Atlanta Braves 
in the ninth round of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft, but opted not 
to sign. During his sophomore year in January 1984, Buhner was taken in 
the second round of the secondary phase of the free-agent draft by the 
Pittsburgh Pirates.[3] He signed in late May, and played for the Watertown 
Pirates in the Class A short season New York–Penn League. That December, 
Buhner was traded to the New York Yankees with infielder Dale Berra as 
part of a five-player deal for outfielder Steve Kemp and shortstop Tim 
Foli, a former Pirate.[4][5][6] The next two seasons were in the Class 
A Florida State League with the Fort Lauderdale Yankees, then Buhner moved 
up to Triple A in 1987 with the Columbus Clippers in the International 
League and hit 31 home runs. Managed by Bucky Dent, Columbus finished second 
in the regular season, but swept both series in the four-team playoffs 
to take the league title and Governors' Cup.[7] With the minor league playoffs 
concluded, Buhner made his major league debut in 1987 on September 11, 
and appeared in seven games that year. In 1988, he was back and forth between 
Columbus and New York,[8] and was batting .188 (13 for 69) with three home 
runs in three stints for the big club when was traded on July 21 to the 
Seattle Mariners,[9] along with two career minor leaguers (Rich Balabon 
and Troy Evers), in exchange for designated hitter Ken Phelps, a Seattle 
native.[9][10][11] This trade is often considered one of the Yankees' worst, 
and one of the Mariners' best.[12] It was referenced on the television 
sitcom Seinfeld, in the January 1996 episode "The Caddy." The Yankees' 
owner, George Steinbrenner, appears at the home of George Costanza's parents 
to inform them – mistakenly – that their son is dead. The only response 
of Frank Costanza (played by Jerry Stiller) is, "What the hell did you 
trade Jay Buhner for?! He had 30 home runs, over 100 RBIs last year! He's 
got a rocket for an arm.... You don't know what the hell you're doing!"[13][14][15] 
The clip was played at Safeco Field when Buhner was inducted into the Mariners' 
Hall of Fame in August 2004.[16][17] Ironically, the Yankees won the World 
Series nine months later, the first of four in five years. Buhner hit his 
stride in 1991, hitting 27 home runs with 77 RBI, and hit a massive home 
run against his former team in Yankee Stadium in July,[18] and had continued 
success against the Yankees.[19] Two years later in an extra-inning game 
against Oakland in 1993, he hit for the cycle in the Kingdome on June 23. 
Buhner hit a triple in the 14th inning to complete it, and scored the winning 
run on a wild pitch; he began the night with a grand slam in the first 
inning.[20][21] While well known for his tendency to strike out, he also 
developed a patience at the plate which allowed him to walk 100 times in 
a season twice (1993 and 1997) and to post a career OBP of .359. By the 
mid-1990s he had developed into one of the premier offensive players in 
the game, hitting over 40 home runs in three consecutive seasons (1995, 
1996, and 1997), becoming just the tenth player to do so (and the first 
since Frank Howard in 1970); this feat has since been equaled by several 
other players. During his career, the M's hosted a popular promotion, "Jay 
Buhner Buzz Cut Night,"[1][22][23][24] where visitors would receive free 
admission in the right field seats if they had a shaved head. Free buzz 
cuts were provided for people who showed up with hair.[25] Buhner himself 
participated in giving fans of all ages buzz cuts, which also included 
women.[26] George Thorogood's song Bad to the Bone was used as Buhner's 
at-bat music during home games. After the 116-win 2001 season, Buhner retired 
at age 37 in December as one of the most popular players in Mariners history.[23][27] 
Although his jersey number 19 has not been issued since, it has not been 
officially retired, per the team's policy regarding retired numbers. The 
Mariners require a player to have spent at least five years with the team 
and be elected to the Hall of Fame or narrowly miss election after spending 
his entire career with the team.[28] Buhner holds the Mariners' career 
record for strikeouts with 1,375, and has the lowest career stolen base 
percentage since 1954 – 6 stolen bases against 24 times caught stealing 
for a success rate of 20% (Caught stealing counts are not complete until 
the 1954 season, when Major League Baseball began maintaining official 
records). After his playing days, Buhner and his family remained in the
