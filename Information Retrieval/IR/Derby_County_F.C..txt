Derby County Football Club (/ˈdɑːrbi ˈkaʊnti/) is a professional association 
football club based in Derby, Derbyshire, England. Their home matches are 
played at Pride Park Stadium, where the club moved in 1997. Notable for 
being one of the 12 founder members of the Football League in 1888, it 
is one of only ten clubs to have competed in every season of the English 
football league system and, in 2009, was ranked 137th in the top 200 European 
football teams of the 20th century by International Federation of Football 
History and Statistics.[1] Derby County F.C. was founded in 1884, by William 
Morley, as an offshoot of Derbyshire County Cricket Club; it has spent 
all but four seasons in the top two divisions of English football. The 
club's competitive peak came in the 1970s when they were twice English 
League Champions and competed in major European competitions on four separate 
occasions, reaching the European Cup semi-finals, as well as winning several 
minor trophies. Additionally, the club was a strong force in the interwar 
years and won the 1945–46 FA Cup. The club adopted its now traditional 
black and white club colours in the 1890s and appropriated its club nickname 
The Rams, a tribute to its links with the First Regiment of Derby Militia, 
which took a ram as its mascot and the song "The Derby Ram" as its regimental 
song,[2] at the same time. Derby County F.C. was formed in 1884 as an offshoot 
of Derbyshire County Cricket Club in an attempt to give players and supporters 
a winter interest as well as secure the cricket club extra revenue. The 
original intention was to name the club "Derbyshire County F.C." to highlight 
the link, though the Derbyshire FA, formed in 1883, objected on the grounds 
it was too long and therefore would not have been understood by the fans 
who may mistake it for a Derbyshire FA team. Playing their home matches 
at the cricket club’s Racecourse Ground, 1884/85 saw the club undertake 
an extensive programme of friendly matches, the first of which was a 6–0 
defeat to Great Lever on 13 September 1884. The club’s first competitive 
match came in the 1885 FA Cup, where they lost 7–0 at home to Walsall Town. 
Arguably the most important game in the club's history came in the following 
season's FA Cup, when a 2–0 victory over Aston Villa, already an emerging 
force in English football, helped establish Derby County F.C. on the English 
football map, helping the club to attract better opposition for friendlies 
and, in 1888, an invitation into the inaugural Football League. The opening 
day of the first ever league season was 8 September 1888, when Derby came 
from 3–0 down away to Bolton Wanderers to win 6–3, though the club ultimately 
finished 10th out of 12 teams. They absorbed another Derby club, Derby 
Midland F.C., who had been members of the Midland League, in 1891, leaving 
them as Derby's sole professional football club. Steve Bloomer, generally 
considered to be Derby County's best-ever player, joined the club in 1892. 
In 1895 the club moved to a new stadium, the Baseball Ground (so called 
because it was previously used for baseball), which became their home for 
the next 102 years and adopted their traditional colours of black and white. 
Although Derby were inconsistent in the league, they did finish runners-up 
to Aston Villa in 1896 as well as achieving a number of third-place finishes. 
They were a strong force in the FA Cup, appearing in three finals in six 
years around the turn of the 20th century, though lost all three, in 1898 
(3–1 to Nottingham Forest),[3] 1899 (4–1 to Sheffield United)[4] and 1903 
(6–0 to Bury).[5] In 1906 Steve Bloomer was sold to Middlesbrough due to 
financial constraints, and Derby subsequently suffered its first ever relegation 
the following season,[6] but under Jimmy Methven's management they re-signed 
Steve Bloomer and regained their First Division place in 1911.[6] In 1914 
they were relegated again, but instantly won the Second Division to get 
promoted[6] (though World War I meant that they had to wait until 1919 
to play First Division football again). After two seasons, they were relegated 
yet again in 1921. However, the appointment of George Jobey in 1925 kick-started 
a successful period for the Rams and, after promotion in 1926,[6] the club 
became a formidable force, with high finishes from the late 1920s and all 
through the 1930s.,[6] including finishing runners up twice. Derby were 
one of several clubs to close down after the outbreak of World War II but 
restarted in the early 1940s, in part due to the persistence of Jack Nicholas 
and Jack Webb. Aided by the recruitment of Raich Carter and Peter Doherty, 
who had both been stationed in Loughborough during the War, Derby were 
one step ahead of the opposition when competitive football resumed with 
the 1946 FA Cup and won their first major trophy with a 4–1 victory over 
Charlton Athletic[7] The League restarted the following season after a 
break due to the Second World War and, under the management of Stuart McMillan, 
as well as twice breaking the British transfer record to sign Billy Steel 
and Johnny Morris to replace Carter and Doherty, finished fourth and third 
in the 1948 and 1949 seasons respectively, before a steady decline set 
in and the club was relegated in 1953, after nearly 30 years in the top 
flight, and again in 1955 to drop to the third tier of English football 
for the first time in their history.[6] Harry Storer led Derby back into 
the second tier at the second attempt in 1957, though the club progressed 
no further over the next decade under either Storer or his successor, former 
Derby player Tim Ward. In 1967, Brian Clough and Peter Taylor took over 
and led them to their greatest glory. Having clinched the influential signing 
of Dave Mackay, Derby were promoted to the First Division in 1969, finished 
fourth in 1970,[6] were banned from competing in Europe due to financial 
irregularities in 1971 and won their first ever Football League Championship 
in 1972.[6] Though Derby did not retain their title the following season, 
they did reach the semi-finals of the European Cup, where they lost to 
Juventus. Clough's frequent outspoken comments against football's establishment 
eventually led to him falling out with the board of directors at the club, 
and Clough and Taylor left in October 1973. Such was their impact on the 
club that, 37 years later, a 9'0 high bronze statue of the pair was erected 
outside Pride Park in commemoration of their legacy.[8] Despite the departure 
of Clough and Taylor, Derby's League success was repeated in the 1974–75 
season when they won the title under successor Dave Mackay, who had been 
a player under Clough when they had returned to the top flight in 1969. 
However, Derby's form declined towards the end of the 1970s and they went 
down to the Second Division in 1980 after a string of managers, including 
former Manchester United boss Tommy Docherty, unsettled the club trying 
desperately to maintain its place at the top of the First Division. Though 
they challenged well in their first season, Derby were soon hit hard by 
rising debts, falling attendances and dismal performances. Peter Taylor 
returned to the Baseball Ground as manager in early 1983 and kept Derby 
up that season, but he retired a year later just before Derby's relegation 
to the Third Division for only the second time in their history. However, 
Derby did manage to avoid going out of business, and they were soon under 
the ownership of wealthy businessman Robert Maxwell. After relegation to 
the Third Division in May 1984, the club appointed Arthur Cox as manager. 
Although they missed out on promotion in Cox's first season as manager, 
they then won back-to-back promotions and were back in the First Division 
for the 1987–88 season, with attendances also rising as the club's on-the-field 
fortunes and financial position improved. The financial backing of new 
chairman Robert Maxwell saw stars such as Peter Shilton, Mark Wright, Dean 
Saunders, Trevor Hebberd and Ted McMinn brought to the club and they finished 
fifth in the 1988–89 season However, English clubs were banned from European 
competition at the time following the Heysel Stadium Disaster and so the 
Rams missed out on a place in the UEFA Cup. A lack of any further investment 
from Maxwell quickly led to a decline, culminating in relegation back to 
the Second Division in 1991. At this time, local newspaper businessman 
Lionel Pickering became the majority shareholder of the club, taking control 
just before Maxwell's death in November 1991. In 1992, Derby County paid 
£2.5 million for Notts County central defender Craig Short, at the time 
– and for five years afterwards – the most expensive player to be signed 
by a club outside the top flight, and indeed one of the highest fees paid 
by any English club for a player at the time. Other expensive signings 
included strikers Tommy Johnson and Marco Gabbiadini. Cox's resignation 
as manager in October 1993 saw the appointment of legendary former player 
Roy McFarland as manager. Derby reached the final of the Division One playoffs 
that season, but were beaten by local rivals Leicester City. McFarland 
was sacked a year later after Derby missed out on the playoffs, and his 
replacement was Jim Smith – a manager whose track record at his previous 
clubs included four promotions and an FA Cup semi-final appearance. Although 
the 1995–96 season started slowly, the signing of sweeper Igor Štimac in 
the early autumn proved pivotal. Smith guided the Rams to a second-place 
finish and the Premier League, now the top flight of English football. 
During that season, it was announced that Derby would be leaving the Baseball 
Ground after more than 100 years to move into a new all-seater stadium, 
following earlier plans to develop the Baseball Ground as a 26,000-seat 
stadium. After finishing in 12th place in their first season back into 
the top flight, the club left the Baseball Ground, its home of 102 years, 
to move into the new 33,597-seat Pride Park Stadium for the 1997–98 season. 
The Baseball Ground was demolished six years later and a memorial was eventually 
erected in memory of its role in Derby city history.[9] The club settled 
well into its new home as it recorded back-to-back top 10 finishes for 
the first time since their 1970s peak, before a sudden decline at the turn 
of the millennium saw three years of struggle. Smith resigned to be replaced 
by former players, Colin Todd, who lasted just three months, and John Gregory 
before the Rams were relegated after a six-year stay in the top flight, 
in 2002. Derby County's relegation saw the club enter a serious financial 
crisis, which forced them to sell many key players. Gregory was later suspended 
from his managerial duties over alleged misconduct and former Ipswich Town 
boss George Burley was brought in. The club was put into receivership then 
sold in October 2003 for £3 to a group led by Jeremy Keith. After finishing 
20th in the 2003–04 season, a dramatic improvement in the 2004–05 season 
saw Derby finish 4th in the Football League Championship, qualifying for 
a promotion play-off spot, though they lost in the semi-finals to Preston 
North End. Soon afterwards, Burley resigned citing differences between 
himself and the board. He was replaced by Bolton first team coach, Phil 
Brown. In January 2006, Brown was sacked after a poor run of results. Terry 
Westley, the academy coach at the time, took over first team duties until 
the end of the season and saved Derby from relegation. In April 2006 a 
consortium of local businessmen led by former vice-chairman Peter Gadsby 
bought the club, reducing its debt and returning Pride Park Stadium to 
the club's ownership in the process. In June 2006, former Preston North 
End boss Billy Davies was appointed Derby County's new permanent manager. 
In his first season, Davies took Derby to the Championship play-offs, where 
they beat Southampton on penalties in the semi-finals before defeating 
West Bromwich Albion 1–0 with a second-half Stephen Pearson goal at the 
new Wembley Stadium to secure a return to the Premier League and the associated 
£60m windfall. In October 2007, Peter Gadsby stepped down as chairman to 
be replaced by former Hull City owner Adam Pearson, who immediately began 
searching for investment from overseas.[10] After a poor start to the season, 
manager Billy Davies left by mutual consent in November.[11] He was succeeded 
by Paul Jewell,[12] who failed to save the club as Derby suffered the Premier 
League's earliest ever relegation, in March,[13] recorded the Premier League's 
lowest-ever points total,[14] and equalled Loughborough's 108-year Football 
League record of going through an entire season with only one win and have 
the status of being the worst football club in football history. In January, 
the club was taken over by an international investment group led by General 
Sports and Entertainment, with Pearson remaining as de facto chairman.[15] 
Derby's match at home to Sheffield United on 13 September 2008 generated 
much media coverage as it was approaching a year since Derby's last league 
win, a run which saw the club break the English league record for most 
matches without a win. Just four days short of the anniversary of the 1–0 
victory over Newcastle, Rob Hulse scored against his former club as Derby 
ran out 2–1 winners, earning Paul Jewell his first league win as Derby 
boss at his 27th attempt. Despite taking the club to the League Cup semi-final, 
the club's first major cup semi-final since 1976, where Derby lost 4–3 
to Manchester United over two legs, Jewell resigned as manager in December 
2008 after a run of just 2 wins in 11 matches.[16] He was replaced by Nigel 
Clough,[17] son of former manager Brian. He led the club to 18th place 
and safety. After two seasons that saw the club finish in the bottom half 
of the table, Derby finished the two subsequent seasons in 12th and 10th 
place. Clough was sacked nine games into the 2013–14 season, after defeat 
to local rivals Nottingham Forest, and was replaced by former Derby player 
and assistant manager Steve McClaren. Under McClaren the club finished 
third in the Championship and reached the final of the play-offs, after 
beating Brighton & Hove Albion 6–2 on aggregate in the semifinals, although 
in the finals they lost 1–0 to Queens Park Rangers in the 89th minute.[18] 
McClaren also saw The Rams beat their record for most goals scored in one 
season (84 goals). The 2014–15 season saw Derby competing at the top end 
of the Championship for much of the season, even leading the table going 
in to March. However, a slump in performances and a poor run of form towards 
the end of the season in which Derby only picked up two wins in thirteen 
matches saw them slide down to eighth, not only missing out on automatic 
promotion, but the play-off positions as well. As a result of this, on 
25 May 2015 Steve McClaren was sacked.[19] Paul Clement was announced as 
McClaren's successor.[20] On 3 June 2015, local businessman Mel Morris 
was named as the new Chairman of the club, replacing Andrew Appleby who 
remained as a director. The 2015–16 season saw Derby again competing for 
promotion to the Premier League. They sacked their head coach, Paul Clement 
after eight months in charge, appointing academy director Darren Wassall 
as coach for the remainder of the season.[21] They finished fifth in the 
league, but lost to Hull in the play-off semi final. Hull went on to win 
the play-off final and promotion. Former Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson 
was appointed head coach in May 2016.[22] Like most old football clubs, 
Derby County did not initially have any badge displayed on their shirts. 
Their first badge was introduced in 1924. The badge consisted of a circular 
shield split into three equally sized sections, representing the club, 
its fans and the area, all containing items traditionally associated with 
the city of Derby: a Tudor rose and a crown in one section, a buck in a 
park in the second and a ram's head in the final section. The badge was 
worn on the players' shirts for just two seasons before they reverted to 
plain shirts. By 1934, another badge had been introduced. This time it 
was a traditionally shaped shield, again with three sections. The buck 
in the park had been removed and the rose and the crown had been split 
up and now occupied a section each. The ram's head also remained and was 
now given the largest section of the shield. The badge never appeared on 
the players' shirts. The shield was modified in 1946 when the rose and 
crown were removed and replaced with the letters DC (Derby County) and 
FC (Football Club) respectively. The badge, right, was featured on to the 
player's shirts from its introduction onwards, though the ram's head on 
its own was used from the late 1960s (the full shield, however, remained 
the club's official logo). A new club badge was introduced in 1971, featuring 
a more modern design that, with modifications, is still in use. The badge 
was initially consisted of a stylised white ram facing left. The badge 
was first modified slightly in 1979 to include the text 'Derby County FC' 
under the ram (though the ram remained on its own on away kits). In 1982 
the ram turned to face to the right and the text under it was removed. 
The ram was surrounded by a wreath of laurel and the text 'Centenary 1984–1985' 
was printed underneath for the club's centenary season. The laurel was 
removed and the text reading 'Derby County FC' returned from the next season. 
In 1993, the ram faced left again and the text was removed once more. From 
1995, the ram faced right and was enclosed in a diamond, with a gold banner 
reading 'Derby County FC' underneath and the text '1884' (the year of the 
club's foundation) underneath that. The design was changed again in 1997 
(see left): the ram faced now left and the golden banner now simply read 
'Derby County'; the diamond and year of formation were removed. A decade 
later, in 2007, the badge was modified again with the ram still facing 
left and the text 'Est. 1884' now in the middle of a circular frame featuring 
'Derby County Football Club' in gold lettering, with the colours being 
modified to the club colours of black and white in 2009 (see top of page). 
In July 2012, the club announced intention to show only the iconic Ram 
on future shirts, rather than the full club logo. In July 2013, this traditional 
Ram became the club's full logo again. Derby County's original colours 
(right) were amber, chocolate and blue, though by the 1890s the club had 
adopted its now traditional colours of black and white, which are still 
in use today. In the 1970s and 80s, colours for home matches were white 
shirts with small blue or red touches (on the club badge or shirt makers 
insignia), blue shorts and socks that were blue, red, white or a combination 
of the three.[23] The colours of away kits have varied widely, and although 
they are usually yellow/gold or blue, the colour for the away kit for the 
2008–09 season was fluorescent green.[24] The club also introduced a surprise 
third kit in August 2008. Similar in design to the club's away kit of the 
1970s, with blue and white stripes and reminiscent of the Argentina strip, 
the style was re-introduced following feedback from fans who said it was 
one of their favourite kits from the club's past.[25] Derby's mascot is 
a ram named Rammie. Rammie is a full-time employee of the club who also 
works to maintain the club's links with fans and the East Midlands in general, 
such as school visits to promote literacy and charity events.[26][27] Rammie 
originally emerged as a more friendly option to the club's traditional 
links with the British Army. Rammie was the first full-time mascot in British 
football.[28][29] Rammie's traditional activities include penalty shoot-outs 
with members of the crowd at half time, with Rammie as goalkeeper, and 
warming the crowd up before the match and encouraging the Derby fans during 
matches. Rammie is a very popular figure amongst Rams' fans[30][31] and, 
in 2005, released his first DVD, which features the character reading from 
Aesop's Fables in the Derbyshire countryside.[28] Shortly thereafter, Rammie 
was joined by a female equivalent, named Eweie. Eweie did not last very 
long at Pride Park, however, and took a reported "vacation" to the United 
States. She returned from a 10-year exile on 3 October 2015, at a home 
match against Brentford F.C.[32] As an offshoot of Derbyshire County Cricket 
Club, Derby County’s first home stadium was County Cricket Ground, also 
known as the Racecourse Ground, where the club played its league and FA 
Cup matches between 1884 and 1895. Although the ground itself was good 
enough to hold the first FA Cup final match outside London, when Blackburn 
Rovers beat W.B.A. 2–0 in the 1886 FA Cup final Replay[33] and a full England 
International, disputes over fixture clashed between the football and cricket 
clubs meant that when the opportunity to play at Sir Francis Ley’s Baseball 
Ground arose, the club accepted.[34] Commonly referred to amongst supporters 
as "the BBG", the club moved to the Baseball Ground in 1895 and remained 
there for the next 102 years, despite opportunities to move in the 1920s 
and 1940s.[34] Derby had already played there, a 1–0 win over Sunderland 
during the 1891–92 season, as an alternate venue after a fixture clash 
at The County Ground. At its peak during the late 1960s, the ground could 
hold around 42,000 – the club’s record attendance achieved following the 
opening of the Ley Stand with a 41,826 crowd watching a 5–0 defeat of Tottenham 
Hotspur on 20 September 1969.[34] From this peak, the continued addition 
of seating saw the capacity drop over the next 15 years to 26,500 in 1985. 
Following the Taylor Report in 1989, and the legal requirement for all 
seater stadia, the ground’s capacity dwindled to just 18,500 by the mid-1990s, 
not enough for the then ambitious second tier club. Despite initially hoping 
to rebuild the Baseball Ground to hold 26,000 spectators, and rejecting 
the offer of two sites elsewhere in Derby, then-Chairman Lionel Pickering 
announced in February 1996 the intention to move to a new, purpose built 
stadium at the newly regenerated Pride Park, with the last ever first team 
game at the Baseball Ground being in May 1997, a 1–3 home defeat to Arsenal, 
though it continued to host reserve games until 2003. Derby's new ground, 
named Pride Park Stadium, was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 
18 July, with a friendly against Sampdoria following on 4 August. Derby 
hold the unique distinction of being the only club to have had three home 
grounds host full England internationals. England beat Ireland 9–0 at the 
Racecourse Ground in 1895, beat Ireland again, 2–1, at the Baseball Ground 
in 1911 and, most recently, Pride Park hosted England's 4–0 win over Mexico 
in May 2001.[35] Pride Park was renamed the iPro Stadium on 7 December 
2013, as part of a 10-year, £7 million sponsorship deal with global sports' 
drink company iPro. Derby is often acknowledged as a 'passionate football 
town' by rival supporters[36] and the press alike. Tony Francis of The 
Daily Telegraph noted: "Derby is a passionate football town... Even in 
Division Two, it's a reasonable bet that crowds at Pride Park would not 
fall far below 20,000. It's historical, it's geographical, it's in the 
blood. Some places have it, some don't."[37] During the 2007–2008 Premiership 
season Derby County fans were repeatedly referred to as the best in the 
country due to their loyalty despite the club's disastrous campaign.[38] 
Almost every home game at Pride Park Stadium was sold out by the Derby 
fans and the club also had a large following away from home. The recognition 
included them being named fans of the season in much national coverage 
of the season, winning an award from Nuts magazine,[39] and being named 
the most loyal supporters in the country in a 2008 survey by Sky Sports 
Magazine.[40] In 2013, Derby supporter Nick Webster was voted Championship 
Fan of the Year.[41] Statistically, the club had the 12th highest average 
attendance in the country in the 2007–08 season,[42] 2008–09,[43] and 2009–10 
seasons[44] despite only having the 15th largest club ground and finishing 
18th or lower in their respective division. In 2008/09 they were the best 
supported club in the Championship, with a larger average attendance than 
9 Premiership clubs, and had the Football Leagues's single largest league 
match attendance, with 33,079 against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 13 April 
2009. Derby's celebrity supporters include actor Robert Lindsay, One Direction 
singer Niall Horan,[45] Blur guitarist Graham Coxon[46] and actor Jack 
O'Connell.[47] It has been reported that O'Connell has persuaded other 
celebrities to support the club, including actors George Clooney[48] and 
Angelina Jolie,[49] and model Cara Delevingne.[50] Derby's primary rival 
clubs are Nottingham Forest, Leicester City and Leeds United,[51] with 
Forest, based in Nottingham, 14 miles east of Derby, being by far the fiercest 
rivals; a 2008 survey named the rivalry the 11th biggest in English football, 
revealing that 9 out of 10 fans from both clubs point to the other as their 
fiercest rival.[52] Meetings between the side are often christened with 
the sobriquet East Midlands derby and the winning team is awarded the Brian 
Clough Trophy. The rivalry as a whole largely developed from the 1970s, 
due to former Derby manager Brian Clough taking over at Forest, much to 
the anger of the Derby fans; in fact some commentators have described the 
rivalry to be as much about which club owns Clough's heart as much as the 
proximity of the clubs geographically.[53] The rivalry with Leicester City 
stems largely from geographical location rather than any shared history.[54] 
Leeds United are disliked due to ongoing friction from the early 1970s 
when Derby and Leeds were two of the top English teams and the scarcely 
concealed hostility between their respective managers, Brian Clough and 
Don Revie.[54] The rivalry is documented in the novel and film The Damned 
United. This rivalry is stronger on Derby's side; whilst Derby consider 
Leeds their 2nd biggest rivals, Leeds fans focus more on their dislike 
of Manchester United and Chelsea.[51] Note: Flags indicate national team

associated with Derby County are represented in the English Football Hall 
of Fame, which was created in 2002 as a celebration of those who have achieved 
at the very peak of the English game. To be considered for induction players/managers 
must be 30 years of age or older and have played/managed for at least five 
years in England.[57] The Football League 100 Legends is a list of "100 
legendary football players" produced by The Football League in 1998, to 
celebrate the 100th season of League football. Eight former Derby players 
made the list. Derby County's Player of the Season award is voted for by 
the clubs supporters and named in honour of Jackie Stamps – who scored 
two goals in Derby's sole FA Cup final victory in 1946. It was first introduced 
in the 1968–69 season.[58] Below is a list of all the permanent managers 
that Derby County have had since the appointment of Harry Newbould in 1900.[60] 
In the 16 years prior to Newbould's appointment, the team was selected 
by club committee, a standard practice by football clubs at the time. The 
club's manager is currently Steve McClaren. He replaced Nigel Pearson, 
following his dismissal on 8th October 2016, after a suspension period. 
He lasted less than 5 months in charge and was replaced by McClaren, who 
is now in his second spell at the club after initially being sacked on 
25 May 2015.[61] Derby County's academy, called Moor Farm, is a purpose-built 
complex situated near the city suburb of Oakwood. It was built in 2003, 
at a cost of £5m,[62] to replace the club's previous academy, The Ram-Arena, 
which was based at Raynesway. It covers 50 acres (200,000 m2) and features 
six full-sized training pitches plus an indoor pitch and includes a gym, 
restaurant, ProZone room and a laundry.[62] When opening the academy, then-Chairman 
Lionel Pickering said that the intent was to have "at least eight players 
from the Academy... in the first-team within three years."[62] Although 
this wasn't achieved, the academy produced a number of notable players 
such as England international midfielder Tom Huddlestone, Wales international 
defender Lewin Nyatanga, Northern Ireland international goalkeeper Lee 
Camp, England under-21s midfielder Miles Addison and England under-19 players 
Giles Barnes and Lee Grant. In April 2009 new manager Nigel Clough announced 
his intention to restructure the academy, appointing former Derby players 
Darren Wassall and Michael Forsyth[63] and Wolves Academy director John 
Perkins to the backroom staff, replacing the departed Phil Cannon, David 
Lowe and Brian Burrows.[64] Following this, and an increased investment 
of £1m-a-year from the club,[65] a number of players broke through to the 
first team squad; ahead of the 2010–11 season, almost a third of the Derby 
squad were academy graduates, with Mason Bennett setting the club record 
for youngest first team appearance when he made his full debut with a start 
in a defeat at Middlesbrough on 22 October 2011 at the age of 15 years 
and 99 days old.[66] This helped strengthen the academy's reputation[67] 
and reinforced CEO Tom Glick's stated desire to make Moor Farm "the academy 
of choice in the Midlands."[67] In August 2012, Derby's academy became 
a tier 2 academy under the new controversial Elite Player Performance Plan.[68] 
It was awarded Tier 1 status two years later in July 2014.[69] Note: the 
leagues and divisions of English football have changed somewhat over time, 
so here they are grouped into their relative levels on the English football 
league system at the time they were won to allow easy comparison of the 
achievement [70] As part of the club's 125th Anniversary in 2009, the Derby 
board took a number of initiatives to celebrate the club's history. As 
part of the club's 125th Anniversary celebrations,[71] it was announced 
that during 2009 each month a vote would be carried out to decide on the 
club's official All Time XI, starting in February 2009 with the goalkeeper, 
with the following eight months offering opportunities for Derby's support 
to select a team based within a 4–4–2 formation, with December's vote being 
reserved for the manager.[72] Voting closed on the 25th of each month, 
with the winner being announced in the following few days.[73] On 2 June 
2009, the Club announced the supporters choice of the Top 10 Goals in the 
club's history, with the fans then asked again to choose their favourite 
from the 10 nominated. The list was obviously biased in favour of more 
recent goals, largely thanks to the increased coverage modern football 
enjoys. Three goals featured from the club's 2008/09 campaign.[83] The 
winners were announced on 22 June 2009.[84] Derby first competed in Europe 
when they entered the 1972–73 European Cup after winning the 1971–72 First 
Division Title,[85] reaching the semi-final stages, where they lost 3–1 
on aggregate to Juventus in controversial circumstances. They had qualified 
for the 1970–71 Fairs Cup after finishing the 1969–70 First Division in 
4th, but were banned from entering the competition for financial irregularities. 
The 70s was the Derby County’s peak in English football and they qualified 
for Europe in three of the next four seasons, competing in the UEFA Cup 
or the European Cup in each of the three seasons between 1974–75 and 1976–77. 
The club then declined rapidly and has not appeared in the top European 
competitions since, though it finished in 5th in the 1989 First Division 
which would have guaranteed entry into the 1989–90 UEFA Cup but English 
Clubs were banned from Europe following the Heysel Stadium Disaster. Outside 
of major competition, the club competed in the Anglo-Italian Cup between 
1992–93 and 1994–95, reaching the final in 1993, losing 3–1 to Cremonese 
at Wembley. Kevin Hector holds the record for Derby County appearances 
in all competitions, turning out 589 times in two separate spells with 
the club between 1966 and 1982. He sits ahead of Ron Webster who played 
535 times for the club, often in the same team as Hector. Just counting 
league appearances, Hector is again in the lead, with 486 appearances, 
ahead of Jack Parry, who played 483 times for the club between 1948 and 
1967. The club's all-time top scorer is Steve Bloomer, often referred to 
as Football's First Superstar, who netted 332 goals for the club in two 
spells between 1892 and 1914. He is over 100 goals ahead of second in the 
list Kevin Hector, who netted 201 goals for the club. Jack Bowers holds 
the club record for most goals in a single season, when he scored 43 goals 
(35 in the league and a further 8 in the FA Cup), during the 1932–33 season. 
The club's record attendance is 41,826, for a First Division match against 
Tottenham Hotspur at the Baseball Ground on 20 September 1969, which Derby 
won 5–0. The record is unlikely to be broken in the near future as Derby's 
current stadium, Pride Park has a limit of 33,597 spectators. The record 
attendance at Pride Park for a competitive Derby County match is 33,378 
for a Premier League match against Liverpool on 18 March 2000. The largest 
crowd to ever watch a Derby County game is 120,000 when Derby County played 
Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in the 1975–76 European Cup. 
Derby hold several records in English football. The 2007–08 Premier League 
campaign saw the club equal Loughborough's all-time league record of just 
one win in an entire league season. They also equalled or set several Premier 
league records (1992–present), including Least Home Wins in a Season (1, 
joint with Sunderland) and Least Away Wins in a Season (0, joint with 5 
other teams) and Most Defeats in a Season (29). Records set included Fewest 
Points in a season (3 points for a win) with 11, Fewest Goals Scored (20) 
and Worst Goal Difference (−69). The club also holds the record for Most 
Consecutive League Games Without A Win, with 37 matches between 22 September 
2007 and 13 September 2008, and the Record Defeat in an FA Cup Final, when 
they lost 6–0 to Bury in 1903.[86] Derby County L.F.C. – Women's football
