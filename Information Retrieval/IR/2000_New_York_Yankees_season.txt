The New York Yankees' 2000 season was the 98th season for the Yankees in 
New York, and their 100th overall going back to their origins in Baltimore. 
New York was managed by Joe Torre. The team finished 1st in the AL East 
with a record of 87â€“74, 2.5 games ahead of the Boston Red Sox, after losing 
15 of their final 18 games. Despite having the lowest winning percentage 
of any postseason qualifier in 2000, the Yankees won the World Series over 
the New York Mets in 5 games to win their 26th World Series title. It is, 
as of the present, the last World Series with a repeat champion. On September 
28, 2000, the Yankees played the Devil Rays at Tampa Bay. In the top of 
the 2nd inning, Jose Canseco was walked. Tino Martinez then hit a double 
to center field. The ball was fielded by Gerald Williams and relayed to 
Mike DiFelice. He tagged Jose Canseco at the plate and proceeded to tag 
out Tino Martinez who was running right behind Canseco. Mike DiFelice tagged 
both runners out at the plate.[15] The Yankees only played 161 games because 
they had a game rained out against the Florida Marlins that was not made 
up due to scheduling constraints and lack of playoff implications. 2B Jose
