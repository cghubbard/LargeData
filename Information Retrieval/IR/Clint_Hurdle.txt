As player As coach As manager Clinton Merrick Hurdle (born July 30, 1957) 
is an American former professional baseball outfielder and current manager 
of the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball. Hurdle played in MLB 
for the Kansas City Royals, Cincinnati Reds, New York Mets, and St. Louis 
Cardinals, and has also managed for the Colorado Rockies. Hurdle was labeled 
a "phenom" by Sports Illustrated at age twenty.[1] After retiring from 
playing baseball, Hurdle became a manager. His eight seasons with the Colorado 
Rockies included leading the 2007 club to the franchise's first National 
League (NL) pennant. On November 14, 2010, the Pirates hired him to be 
their manager. In 2013, Hurdle led them to their first winning season and 
playoff appearance since 1992. He was named the NL Manager of the Year 
that season. Clint Hurdle is named for his father, Clinton, who played 
collegiate baseball for Ferris State University. When Hurdle was four years 
old, the family moved from Michigan to Florida so his father could take 
a job at the Kennedy Space Center.[2] Hurdle graduated from Merritt Island 
High School in Merritt Island, Florida. He received a scholarship from 
the University of Miami to play college baseball and college football as 
a quarterback.[3] Hurdle is married to third wife Karla and has three children; 
daughter Madison (who was born in 2002 and has Prader-Willi Syndrome), 
son Christian (who was born in 2004), and daughter Ashley (who was born 
in 1985 and is from a previous marriage).[4] Hurdle is a recovering alcoholic.[5] 
The Kansas City Royals selected Hurdle in the first round, with the ninth 
overall selection, of the 1975 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with 
the Royals, receiving a $50,000 signing bonus. He made his major league 
debut with the Royals in 1977, and in 1978 was featured on the cover of 
Sports Illustrated on March 20 with the headline: "This Year's Phenom."[1][3] 
Hurdle played for the Royals through 1981, but never achieved the level 
of play suggested by his high draft position. Playing regularly only in 
1978 and 1980, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in December 1981, and 
after spending 1982 with the Reds, went on waivers to join the New York 
Mets (1983, 1985) and St. Louis Cardinals (1986) before ending his career 
with the Mets in 1987. Throughout his career, he also played first base, 
third base, catcher, and designated hitter. Hurdle also played in the Venezuelan 
Professional Baseball League during three different seasons. In his first 
season, 1977–78, he led the league in home runs (18) while batting .305 
with 52 RBIs. He played again in 1979 and 1983. In all three times he led 
the league in walks while playing for the local team Tiburones de La Guaira[6][7] 
After ending his playing career in 1987, Hurdle began his managerial career 
the next year when he was named Manager of the St. Lucie Mets of the Class 
A-Advanced Florida State League in 1988. He also served as Manager for 
the Jackson Mets of the Class AA Texas League (1990), Williamsport Bills 
of the Class AA Eastern League (1991), and the Tidewater/Norfolk Tides 
of the Class AAA International League (1992–1993). In 1994 he joined the 
Colorado Rockies organization as the minor league hitting instructor, serving 
in that capacity until he was named the Rockies hitting coach in 1997. 
Hurdle was promoted to Manager in 2002 following the early-season firing 
of Buddy Bell. On April 2, 2006, he was given a two-year contract extension.[8] 
In 2007, Hurdle managed Colorado to their second best finish in the team's 
15-year history (only topped by the 2009 season) by winning 13 out of the 
last 14 games in order to force a tie-breaker game with the San Diego Padres 
to determine the winner of the National League Wild Card. Colorado defeated 
San Diego, reaching the playoffs for only the second time in Rockies history. 
Hurdle's Rockies then beat the Philadelphia Phillies in the Division Series, 
sweeping them in three games to force a match-up with their rival Arizona 
Diamondbacks in the NLCS. The Rockies continued their improbable streak 
by sweeping Arizona in four games to win the first pennant in team history 
and reach the 2007 World Series.[9] In the World Series, Colorado faced 
the Boston Red Sox. But the winning ways came to an end, and the Rockies 
were swept in four games. Injuries to several regulars caused the Rockies 
to fade in 2008, and after a poor start in 2009, Hurdle was fired on May 
29. Although Hurdle was offered a "significant role" within the Rockies 
organization, he decided to join the MLB Network as a studio analyst for 
the remainder of 2009.[10] He finished with a 534–625 win–loss record.[11] 
On November 4, 2009, he was hired as the hitting coach for the Texas Rangers.[12] 
The Rangers hoped that Hurdle could connect with Josh Hamilton, who also 
suffered from substance abuse.[3] In 2010, Hurdle helped the Rangers to 
their first American League pennant in franchise history before losing 
to the San Francisco Giants in the 2010 World Series. After interviewing 
with both the Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Mets for their vacant managerial 
positions, Hurdle was hired by the Pirates on November 14, 2010, after 
they fired John Russell.[13] Hurdle then agreed to a three-year contract, 
keeping him with the team through the 2013 season.[14] At the 2011 All-Star 
break, Hurdle had led the Pirates to a 47–43 record, one game out of first 
place in the NL Central. It was the first time the Pirates had been over 
.500 going into the All-Star break since winning the 1992 National League 
East. At the 2012 All-Star break, Hurdle had led the Pirates to a 48–37 
record, leading the NL Central division by 1 game over the Cincinnati Reds. 
However, both seasons ended with collapses that led to the Pirates 19th 
and 20th straight losing seasons. During parts of the 2013 season, the 
Pirates led the National League Central, with the best record in the major 
leagues, again aiming to snap the franchise's long losing streak. On September 
9, 2013 with a 1–0 win over the Texas Rangers Clint Hurdle's Pittsburgh 
Pirates attained win number 82. On September 23, 2013 with a 2–1 win over 
the Chicago Cubs and a win by the St. Louis Cardinals over the Washington 
Nationals, the Pittsburgh Pirates secured their first playoff berth since 
1992 as well as their 90th win. Under Hurdle, the Pirates would finish 
the 2013 season with a record of 94 wins and 68 losses, 3 games behind 
the NL Central division winning Cardinals. In the playoffs, the Pirates 
won the 2013 National League Wild Card Game against the Reds but would 
lose the deciding game 5 against the Cardinals in the 2013 National League 
Division Series. Hurdle won the National League Sporting News Manager of 
the Year Award in 2013. In 2014, the Pirates would again clinch a playoff 
berth with a record of 88 wins and 74 losses to make a second straight 
appearance in the Wild Card game. The Pirates lost the 2014 National League 
Wild Card Game to the eventual World Series champion San Francisco Giants. 
In 2015 the Pirates again made the postseason as one of the National League 
wild card teams with a 98–64 record, the second best record of any team 
that season. The Pirates lost the 2015 National League Wild Card Game to
