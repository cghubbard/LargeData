Cyril Roy Weatherly (February 25, 1915 – January 19, 1991), nicknamed "Stormy", 
was an American professional baseball player whose career extended for 
two decades (1934–1943; 1946–1954; 1958). The native of Tyler County, Texas, 
an outfielder, appeared in 811 Major League games over ten seasons for 
the Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees and New York Giants. Weatherly 
batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Despite his relatively small 
size — he stood 5 ft 6½ in (1.69 m) tall and weighed 173 pounds (78 kg) 
— he hit more than 100 home runs in minor league baseball. As a Major Leaguer, 
Weatherly collected 794 hits, with 152 doubles, 44 triples, and 43 home 
runs. His finest season was 1940, when he batted .303 with career highs 
in runs scored, hits, doubles, triples, home runs, and runs batted in for 
the contending Indians, finishing eleventh in the American League Most 
Valuable Player voting. Traded to the Yankees after the 1942 season, he 
appeared in one game as a pinch hitter during the 1943 World Series, popping 
out in the eighth inning of Game 2 against Mort Cooper of the St. Louis 
Cardinals.[1] Although the Yankees lost that game, that was the only contest 
they would drop as they won the Series in five games. Weatherly missed 
the 1944 and 1945 seasons while serving in the United States Army during 
World War II.[2] In the Black Sheep Squadron episode "The Hawk Flies on 
Sunday," an episode about the shooting down of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto 
on April 18, 1943, a member of Marine fighter pilot squadron VMF-214 (the 
"Black Sheep") is portrayed listening to a Red Sox/Yankees game in which 
the Red Sox led 3-2 until the bottom of the ninth, when Roy Weatherly hits 
a two-run walk-off home run. The event is fictional. Weatherly did hit 
a walk-off two run home run against the Red Sox in 1943, but it occurred 
during the first game in a doubleheader played on August 29, 1943 in the 
bottom of the tenth, breaking a 4-4 tie and giving the Yankees a 6-4 win.
