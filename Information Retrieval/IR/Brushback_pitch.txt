In baseball, a brushback pitch is a pitch–usually a fastball–thrown high 
and inside the strike zone to intimidate the batter away from the plate 
on subsequent pitches.[1] It differs from the beanball in that the intent 
is not to hit the batter, nor does it target the batter's head.[2] Hitters 
will often crowd the plate in order to have a better swing at pitches on 
the outside half of the plate. The hitters hope that the pitcher will be 
scared to throw inside because they might hit the batter. The brushback 
helps a pitcher to "reclaim" the corners of the strike zone by forcing 
the batter to stand farther away. Play-by-play announcers sometimes call 
a high brushback pitch as being "high and tight." It is also referred to 
as chin music. While the brushback can be an effective part of pitching, 
the home plate umpire may warn or eject a pitcher he feels is intentionally
