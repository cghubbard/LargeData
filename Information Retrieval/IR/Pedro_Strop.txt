Pedro √Ångel Strop (born June 13, 1985), known as Pedro Strop, is a Dominican 
professional baseball pitcher for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He debuted in MLB with the Texas Rangers. Strop was originally signed 
as an international free agent by the Colorado Rockies in 2002. Strop was 
a position player in the Rockies minor league system from 2002 to 2005, 
primarily playing shortstop. Strop moved from shortstop to pitching in 
2006 due to posting poor hitting numbers.[1] His tenure in the Rockies 
organization ended with his release by the Rockies on September 19, 2008. 
Strop was signed by the Texas Rangers as a free agent on September 23, 
2008. On August 28, 2009 Pedro made his MLB debut and struck out his first 
batter, the Twins star catcher Joe Mauer. Pedro Strop appeared in seven 
games in 2009, pitching seven innings. He gave up six hits, six runs, and 
four walks and had an ERA of 7.71. He struck out nine batters as well. 
Strop pitched one game in June 2010, on the second against the White Sox 
in which he struck out one batter and walked a batter and went back to 
the minors. In a trade the Texas Rangers made that sent Bengie Molina to 
the team, Pedro Strop was rewarded with the empty roster spot. He pitched 
in three games before returning to the minors when other trades were made. 
As of his last appearance on July 9 against Baltimore, he appeared in four 
games overall in the 2010 season, pitching 3.2 innings while giving up 
three hits and a run. He has walked three batters and struck out three 
batters. On August 31, 2011, Strop was traded from the Rangers to the Baltimore 
Orioles as the player to be named later in the trade for Mike Gonzalez.[2] 
He finished his 2011 season going 2-0 for Baltimore with a 0.73 ERA. His 
pitching success continued for the majority of 2012.Through August 15 of 
that season, Strop achieved a 1.20 ERA primarily as a set up man to closer 
Jim Johnson. But over the final six weeks of the season, Strop's ERA for 
that period was 7.24 with an OPS of .916.[3] He picked up a win against 
the Yankees pitching two innings in extra innings in the 2012 American 
League Division Series playoffs. After pitching well in the World Baseball 
Classic prior to the start of the 2013 season, Strop's late season 2012 
struggles continued. In 29 games for the Orioles, Strop went 0-3 with a 
7.25 ERA.[4] Baltimore crowds began to boo the reliever and Strop said 
of the booing, "They [the fans] don't care about players, they care about 
good results."[5] About two weeks after his comments, Strop was traded 
to the National League. On July 2, 2013, Strop was traded along with Jake 
Arrieta to the Cubs in exchange for Scott Feldman and Steve Clevenger. 
Strop has primarily served in the setup role for the Cubs. In 37 more appearances 
with the Cubs to finish 2013, Strop had a 2-2 record and a 2.83 ERA. Overall 
in 2013, combined with both teams, Strop made 66 total appearances with 
a 2-5 record and a 4.55 ERA. In 2014, Strop made 65 appearances with a 
2-4 record and a 2.21 ERA. In 2015, Strop made 76 appearances with a 2-6 
record, a 2.91 ERA, and 81 strikeouts. In 2016, Strop made 54 appearances 
with a 2-2 record and a 2.85 ERA. The Cubs would eventually win the 2016 
World Series, giving Strop his first world series title.[6] In 2013, Strop 
pitched as a reliever in the World Baseball Classic for the championship
