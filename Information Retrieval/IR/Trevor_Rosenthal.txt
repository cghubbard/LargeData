Trevor Jordan Rosenthal (born May 29, 1990) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
The Cardinals drafted him to pitch in 2009 from Cowley County Community 
College in Kansas despite having played mostly shortstop. In the minor 
leagues, the Cardinals groomed him to be a starting pitcher. When he made 
his major league debut on July 18, 2012, Rosenthal became the 2,000th player 
to make an appearance in Cardinals' franchise history. He has appeared 
exclusively out of the bullpen as a major leaguer, filling middle relief, 
set-up and closing roles. Rosenthal threw 20 1⁄3 scoreless innings to begin 
his postseason career. From 2014–15, he became the third-youngest pitcher 
to record back-to-back 40 save seasons, and in 2015, set the Cardinals' 
franchise record for saves. He is known for a fastball that is difficult 
for hitters to pick up and on occasion reaches velocities at or over 100 
miles per hour (160 km/h).[1] Trevor Rosenthal, the son of Judy (Henke) 
and Russ Rosenthal,[2] was born and raised in the Kansas City, Missouri, 
area. He graduated from Lee's Summit West High School in Lee's Summit, 
Missouri. He is Christian.[3] After graduating from Lee's Summit, Rosenthal 
attended Cowley County Community College in Arkansas City, Kansas, to play 
collegiate baseball. In 2009, the Cowley County baseball team, of which 
he was a member, qualified for the Junior College World Series.[4] When 
Cardinals scout Aaron Looper first spotted Rosenthal, he was a shortstop 
who had just started pitching – he had totalled 4 2⁄3 Innings pitched (IP) 
at that time – and was throwing well over 90 miles per hour (140 km/h) 
off the mound in a tournament.[5][6] Looper watched him for just one inning 
in that tournament. Cardinals director of scouting Jeff Luhnow remarked 
that “Looper thought he had ability and could get better, had great arm 
action, great stuff and was pretty good today but could get a lot better.”[7] 
The Cardinals drafted Rosenthal in the 21st round of the 2009 MLB Draft.[6] 
He signed for $65,000.[8] The club first assigned him to the Gulf Coast 
League (GCL) in 2009, where he made 14 appearances for the GCL Cardinals 
and posted a ground ball rate of 58%.[8][9] The next season, he moved up 
to the Johnson City Cardinals of the Appalachian League and spent the season 
there. He pitched in 10 games, starting six over 32 IP. Posting a 3–0 record 
(W–L), Rosenthal finished with a 2.25 earned run average (ERA), striking 
out 30 (SO), allowing just one home run and a 3.27 ground ball/fly ball 
ratio (G/F).[9] He also posted a ground ball rate of 68%.[8] Said Cardinals 
general manager (GM) John Mozeliak of Rosenthal: "We realized we had a 
talent early on, when we sent him to Johnson City. Then when he went to 
Quad Cities, we knew exactly what we had because he really took off there."[6] 
Rosenthal spent 2011 with the Quad City River Bandits, then a Cardinals 
Class A affiliate, helping them to a Midwest League championship. He started 
the final game of the championship series in a three-game sweep of the 
Lansing Lugnuts, pitching six innings, allowing four hits and two walks 
(BB) while striking out nine in a 6–3 victory.[10] This was Rosenthal's 
first full season pitching professional baseball. During the regular season, 
he started 22 games, pitched 120 1⁄3 innings with 133 S0 for a 4.11 ERA, 
9.9 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (K/9), a 1.247 walks plus hits per 
inning pitched (WHIP) and 52% ground ball rate.[8][11] Rosenthal's 2010 
and 2011 performances earned an invite to St. Louis Cardinals spring training 
in 2012 where his fastball lit up radar guns and the faces among club officials. 
While Mozeliak, manager Mike Matheny and others stated they felt Rosenthal 
was ready for the major leagues, a lack of space on the roster saw him 
start the season with the Double-A affiliate Springfield Cardinals.[12] 
Due to his start in Springfield, that signaled Cardinals management made 
the unusual choice of having Rosenthal skip the advanced-A level Palm Beach 
Cardinals.[13] He started the Midwest League All-Star Game.[14] At Springfield, 
he started 17 games and tallied 94 IP, 83 SO, a 1.106 WHIP and a 2.78 ERA. 
He made his Major League début later that season and also pitched three 
games for the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds. In the minor leagues, Rosenthal 
has appeared in 66 total games, making 48 starts, accumulating 285 1⁄3 
IP, 237 hits allowed and 98 BB for a 3.53 ERA and 1.174 WHIP. He also posted 
293 SO for a ratio of 9.2 K/9.[11] The Cardinals called up Trevor Rosenthal 
from Springfield for the first time to the Major Leagues on July 16, 2012, 
and he made his début two days later as the 2,000th player in franchise 
history dating back to 1882.[12] He was also the first to be the 2,000th 
player for any Major League franchise.[14] Twice sent briefly back down 
to the Redbirds during the season, Rosenthal returned to St. Louis on August 
29 and remained the rest of the year, ending the season with seven straight 
scoreless appearances.[6] He posted a 2.78 ERA while striking out 25 in 
22 2⁄3 IP and held opponents to 14 hits in 89 plate appearances with a 
.175 batting average against.[4] Rosenthal's successful rookie season carried 
over into the postseason, making him instrumental in the Cardinals' playoff 
run as they needed bullpen help.[5] In his playoff debut against the Washington 
Nationals in the National League Division Series (NLDS), he struck out 
the side, retiring Jayson Werth, Bryce Harper and Adam LaRoche while allowing 
a single to Ryan Zimmerman.[4] Six more scoreless appearances followed 
as the Cardinals advanced to the National League Championship Series (NLCS).[6] 
In all, Rosenthal struck out 15 of total 30 batters faced in the 2012 playoffs.[15] 
Rosenthal also spent the 2013 season in the bullpen. An injured ulnar collateral 
ligament in closer Jason Motte's elbow required Tommy John surgery to repair, 
forcing him to miss the entire season. Matheny reshuffled the bullpen, 
placing Rosenthal in the set-up role and Edward Mujica to replace Motte 
as the closer. However, late in the year, fatigue and ineffectiveness marred 
an otherwise stellar season on Mujica's part, and Matheny called upon Rosenthal 
to save three games late in the season. Although Matheny publicly stated 
that closing games would be accomplished by a committee, Rosenthal appeared 
most frequently to save games.[16][17] For the season, Rosenthal totaled 
75 1⁄3 IP, a 2.63 ERA and 108 strikeouts for average of 12.9 K/9.[18] Among 
all MLB relievers who pitched at least 50 innings and started less than 
20% of their appearances, Rosenthal's 12.9 K/9 ranked sixth.[19] That postseason, 
Rosenthal continued his dominance. He pitched 11 2⁄3 more scoreless innings 
in the NLDS against the Pittsburgh Pirates, the NLCS against the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, and the World Series against the Boston Red Sox, striking out 
18 of the 40 batters he faced and allowing just four hits.[18] In Game 
2 of the NLCS, he entered in the ninth with fellow rookie Michael Wacha's 
five-hit shutout and one-run lead on the line. First, he struck out Dodgers 
rookie outfielder Yasiel Puig looking on the outside corner with a 98 MPH 
fastball. Next, Juan Uribe struck out swinging on a 99 MPH fastball above 
the shoulders. To end the game and preserve the win, Andre Ethier struck 
out looking on a fastball down the middle.[20] He also tallied one win 
and four saves. Spanning his 2012 and 2013 postseasons, Rosenthal had yet 
to allow a run in 20 1⁄3 career postseason innings, allowing just six hits 
and striking out 33, for an average of 14.6 K/9.[18][21][22] Rosenthal's 
average fastball velocity in 2013 was 96.4 miles per hour (155.1 km/h), 
the sixth-highest among all MLB relievers.[20] After the World Series, 
he publicly expressed the desire to be a starting pitcher in 2014. However, 
with Motte still recovering from Tommy John surgery, Mozeliak announced 
Rosenthal would be the closer at the beginning of the next season.[21] 
In response, he quipped, "They don't know it yet, but I'm still competing 
for a starting spot."[23] Despite a rocky start to the season, Rosenthal 
has settled into the closer role well. As of September 7, he led the MLB 
with 43 saves. He stayed in the closer role despite the return of former 
closer Jason Motte and a brief ninth-inning experiment with Pat Neshek. 
Rosenthal finished second in the NL with 45 saves. He exhibited unusual 
control problems, walking 42 batters in 70 1⁄3 IP, more than double the 
walks in 2013. In spite of the increase in walks, he allowed a 3.20 ERA 
and struck out 87 batters, an average of 11.1 per nine innings. From May 
5[24] to July 3, 2015, Rosenthal threw 23 2⁄3 IP scoreless innings. The 
streak ended against the San Diego Padres when Jedd Gyorko singled home 
the go-ahead run in the ninth. At the time, it was the longest of the season 
among relief pitchers in the National League.[25] With a 0.70 ERA in 37 
appearances and 24 of 25 saves converted through July 6, he was selected 
by fellow players to his first MLB All-Star Game at Great American Ball 
Park in Cincinnati. He received more votes than any other NL reliever.[26] 
In August 2015, Baseball America published that National League managers 
and coaches rated Rosenthal the third-best reliever in the league.[27] 
After saving his 40th game against the Arizona Diamondbacks on August 26, 
Rosenthal became the third-youngest MLB pitcher to record back-to-back 
40 save seasons, and just the second Cardinals pitcher to do so. The first 
Cardinals pitcher to achieve this feat was Lee Smith, who registered 40 
or more saves each season from 1991–93.[28] He became the seventh reliever 
overall to post back-to-back seasons of 45 or more saves.[29] In a September 
28 contest against the Pirates, Rosenthal gained his 48th save, breaking 
the franchise single-season record, which Smith and Jason Isringhausen 
shared entering the season.[30] He finished the regular season with the 
same save total, a 2.10 ERA, the fourth-highest pitch total among NL relievers, 
and an average fastball velocity of 97.6 miles per hour (157.1 km/h).[31] 
Rosenthal was a co-winner of the 2015 J. G. Taylor Spink St. Louis Baseball 
Man of the Year Award.[32] Arbitration-eligible for the first time prior 
to the 2016 season, Rosenthal and Cardinals agreed to a $5.6 million salary 
on January 15, 2016,[33] a raise from $530,000.[29] He recorded his 100th 
career save by striking out the side against the Chicago Cubs on April 
20, becoming the fifth Cardinals pitcher to accumulate 100 saves.[34] On 
two occasions, he walked the bases loaded without recording an out: on 
May 12 against Anaheim, and on June 3 against San Francisco, totaling 16 
walks in 17 IP for the season through the June 3 game.[35] The Cardinals 
removed him from the role of closer on June 25 after his ERA had risen 
to 5.63 with an average of 7.9 walks per nine innings.[36] He was replaced 
by rookie Seung-hwan Oh. With a sinking fastball that reaches the mid-90s 
miles per hour (MPH) and induces ground balls at a rate of over 50%, that 
pitch was seen as major league competitive.[8] However, Rosenthal also 
throws a straighter fastball higher in the strike zone with a regular velocity 
of 98 miles per hour (158 km/h) to change the batters' eye level which 
they have difficulty picking up.[37] This pitch routinely touches 100 miles 
per hour (160 km/h).[15] He also throws a curveball and changeup that, 
according to Bleacher Report's Doug Mead, have been deemed as "effective."[15] 
However, according to Thomas Belmont of Baseball Instinct, the curveball 
is actually a slider. The pitch has sharp movement and has the potential 
to be a major league quality out pitch.[8] Observed one American League 
scout during the 2013 World Series, "He’s got one of those loose-arm deliveries 
that creates great life on his fastball. He has such tight spin on his 
slider that (Shane) Victorino and (Dustin) Pedroia looked helpless against 
it."[38] Rosenthal has developed his changeup to be an average pitch since 
2011 when he played his first full season of professional baseball with 
Quad Cities, expanding the quality of the pitch sequence which he is able 
to throw to major league hitters.[8] One unusual trend about the results 
is that Rosenthal has consistently had a higher than league average batting 
average on balls in play (BABIP) – a statistic in which league average 
is typically about .300. In 2009, Rosenthal's BABIP was .362 and .334 in 
2011. In 2010, it actually dipped to the other extreme, to .262.[8] In 
his first major league season, 2013, it was .347.[39] Rosenthal is married 
to the former Lindsey Bowers, whom he wed in December, 2011 in Bristol, 
Tennessee.[41] They have two daughters. Their first child, Chloe Elizabeth, 
was born on September 13, 2013.[42] Their second child, Adalyn Grace, was 
born August 28, 2015.[43] Lindsey, along with his parents, brother (Tanner), 
and agent Scott Boras, attended his MLB debut at Miller Park in Milwaukee 
on July 18, 2012.[44] Rosenthal's father frequently receives invitations 
to bar mitzvahs owing to their German family name despite being Christians.[3] 
Over the 2012 offseason, Rosenthal stayed in St. Louis to work out with 
former Cardinals starting pitcher Chris Carpenter.[45] Two offseasons later, 
he participated in a training regimen with outfielder and teammate Matt 
Holliday which Holliday described as "NFL program," consisting of "sled 
pushing, tire flipping and some fireman carries," and each player taking 
turns carrying each other for about 20 metres. Rosenthal was building strength 
in anticipation of pitching from the bullpen in 2014, which the Cardinals 
already had announced would be his role for that season.[46] On January 
13, 2016, Rosenthal paid a surprise visit to Ethan Cortez, a 10-year-old 
boy who was recovering from a dog bite at St. Louis Children's Hospital.[47] 
Later that month, Rosenthal served as the grand marshal for the 2016 Beggin' 
Pets Parade, a showcase for pets in costumes, held in Soulard, a historic 
French neighborhood of St. Louis. Four years earlier, this parade had set 
the Guinness world record for "most dogs in costumed attire."[48] While 
lining up during a game for the National Anthem on June 1, Rosenthal was 
caught on camera wearing the Memorial Day uniform, two days after the holiday.[49]
