"Piranhas" (also known as "Little Piranhas") was a nickname applied to 
a group of hitters for the Minnesota Twins baseball team. Specifically, 
the term applied to shortstop Jason Bartlett, third baseman Nick Punto, 
outfielder Jason Tyner, and second baseman Luis Castillo. Midway through 
the 2006 season, the Twins opted for a lineup that included Tyner batting 
eighth, Bartlett ninth, Castillo first, and Punto second. Manager Ron Gardenhire 
said these players were like four leadoff hitters: all were fast and hit 
for average but not power. During the 2006 season, all four hit between 
.290 (Punto) and .312 (Tyner), but hit a combined six home runs.[1] The 
term "piranhas" was coined during the 2006 season by Chicago White Sox 
manager Ozzie Guillén. Said Guillen: Despite the fact that the term came 
from a rival manager, it was quickly embraced by both the players and the 
fans, as well as media outlets such as ESPN.[3] After running a popular 
"Twins Territory" commercial in 2007 featuring Jason Bartlett and Nick 
Punto at the Mall of America's Underwater World as "Piranhas" [4] the Minnesota 
Twins organization marketed official T-shirts, hats, signs, the team even 
had a "Little Piranha Night" in which piranha finger puppets were given 
to fans attending the game that evening.[5] During the 2008 Minnesota Twins 
season, the team played similarly to the 2006 piranhas team. Nick Punto 
(shortstop) batting eighth, Carlos Gómez (center field) batting ninth, 
Denard Span (right field) batting first and Alexi Casilla (second base) 
batting second, were another set of speedy hitters. Hitting for average 
but not power, these players, like the original piranhas, orchestrated 
numerous one or two-run innings that led to eventual wins.[citation needed]
