Rajai Lavae Davis (/ˈrɑːʒeɪ ˈdeɪvᵻs/; born October 19, 1980) is an American 
professional baseball outfielder who is currently a free agent. He has 
played in Major League Baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates, San Francisco 
Giants, Oakland Athletics, Toronto Blue Jays, Detroit Tigers, and Cleveland 
Indians. Davis began his career as a switch-hitter, but became a full-time 
right-handed hitter prior to the 2004 season. He also throws right-handed.[1] 
Davis was born in Norwich, Connecticut, on October 19, 1980. He played 
Little League Baseball in Willimantic, Connecticut, for the Willimantic 
Fire Fighters. In 1991, Davis helped the Willimantic Little League All-Star 
Team win the District 11 championship. In 1999, Davis graduated from New 
London High School where he earned letters playing baseball, basketball, 
and football.[2] During the summer he was a member of the New London American 
Legion team.[citation needed] After high school, Davis attended the University 
of Connecticut at Avery Point of the NJCAA in Groton.[1] While in college, 
Davis played for the New England Collegiate Baseball League's Middletown 
Giants (now the Futures Collegiate Baseball League's North Shore Navigators). 
Davis was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 38th round (1,134th 
overall) of the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft as a second baseman.[3] 
He played six full minor league seasons before making his major league 
debut. He had a .305 career minor league batting average to go along with 
251 stolen bases in 322 attempts. In addition, Davis made three consecutive 
All-Star appearance at three different levels of play from 2002 to 2004.[4] 
Davis made his major league debut for the Pirates on August 14, 2006, going 
0-for-1 in a pinch hit appearance against the Milwaukee Brewers. He stole 
his first base two days later, but did not get his first Major League hit 
for another two weeks. It came on August 29, in the form of a pinch hit 
double off Chicago Cubs pitcher Carlos Zambrano. He made his first and 
only defensive appearance of 2006 the next day, playing three innings in 
right field.[1] Davis was traded to the San Francisco Giants with pitcher 
Stephen MacFarland on July 31, 2007, for Matt Morris.[5] He made his Giants 
debut the next night against the Los Angeles Dodgers, stealing a base and 
throwing out a runner from center field.[6] In his time with the Giants, 
Davis was a semi-regular in the Giants lineup, filling in for Dave Roberts 
or Barry Bonds whenever necessary. On August 13, the Giants played a doubleheader 
in Pittsburgh, which was Davis' first time back since the trade. He started 
in center in both games, going a combined three-for-seven, with three doubles, 
two runs scored, two stolen bases, and a run batted in (RBI).[7][8] Additionally, 
in the second game, Davis made a spectacular diving catch on the warning 
track in left-center field.[9][10] Just three days later, he robbed Andruw 
Jones of a possible home run to end the game at Turner Field.[10][11] Davis 
kept the ball as a souvenir.[3] The next night, Davis hit his first career 
home run off Florida Marlins starting pitcher Scott Olsen.[12] Davis was 
second among the National League (NL) rookie leaders in stolen bases, with 
22. The leader, Arizona's Chris Young, had 27 – but also had nearly three 
times as many at-bats as Davis.[13] On April 23, 2008, Davis was claimed 
off waivers by the Oakland Athletics and was added to the active roster. 
With Oakland in 2008, he stole 25 bases in 196 at-bats. In 2009, Davis 
became the primary center fielder for the A's hit .305 with 41 stolen bases 
in 125 games, primarily in center field. In 2010 he also started for most 
of the season hitting .284 with 52 RBIs and 50 stolen bases. When Coco 
Crisp came back from injury, Davis switched from center to left and right 
field for the remainder of the season.[14] Following the acquisition of 
David DeJesus, the Athletics traded Davis to the Toronto Blue Jays for 
Trystan Magnuson and Daniel Farquhar on November 17, 2010.[15] In a game 
against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on August 14, 2011, Davis tore 
his hamstring running to first base. He was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list after the game. Prior to the injury, Davis ranked third in the American 
League in stolen bases with 34.[16] On May 18, 2012, in a home game against 
the New York Mets, Davis had the first multi home run game of his career, 
hitting two home runs and four RBIs in a 14–5 win.[17] On July 30 in a 
game against the Seattle Mariners, Davis hit his first career lead-off 
home run. The home run, his sixth of the season, established a career high 
for Davis in a single season. On August 12, 2012, Davis recorded five RBIs 
against the New York Yankees, establishing a single game career high in 
RBIs.[18] Davis finished second in stolen bases, with 46, for the 2012 
campaign (Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim led the league 
with 49). Davis was placed on the disabled list on May 11, 2013, with a 
strained left oblique.[19] After a brief two game rehab assignment with 
the Dunedin Blue Jays, Davis was activated from the disabled list on June 
4.[20] On June 8, in the bottom of the 18th inning against the Texas Rangers, 
Davis hit a single that scored Emilio Bonifacio in the longest Blue Jays 
game in franchise history.[21] In a game against the Houston Astros on 
July 28, Davis tied a Blue Jays franchise record by stealing four bases, 
joining Damaso Garcia, Dave Collins, Roberto Alomar, and Otis Nixon.[22] 
On December 11, 2013, the Tigers signed Davis to a two-year, $10 million 
contract.[23] On June 30, 2014, he hit a walk-off grand slam home run against 
Oakland Athletics closer Sean Doolittle to win the game 5–4. It was the 
first walk-off homer of any kind for Davis in his career.[24] On August 
30, 2014, Davis recorded his 32nd stolen base of the season, and his 300th 
stolen base of his career. Davis became just the second active player to 
record a 30-steal season for three different teams. Davis' 300 stolen bases 
ranks him 12th among active players.[25] In 2014, Davis played in 134 games 
for Detroit, batting .282 with 36 stolen bases. He was used in an outfield 
platoon in 2015, playing in 112 games. Despite limited plate appearances 
this season (370), he hit a career-high 11 triples. On December 17, 2015, 
Davis signed a one-year, $5.25 million contract with the Cleveland Indians.[26] 
On July 2, 2016, Davis hit for the cycle in a game against the Toronto 
Blue Jays. It was the eighth cycle in Cleveland Indians franchise history, 
the first since Travis Hafner in 2003, and the sixth player in Major League 
history to hit for a reverse cycle. He led off the game with a home run, 
hit a triple in the third inning, a double in the sixth inning, and finished 
the cycle with a single in the ninth inning. On November 2, 2016, during 
Game 7 of the 2016 World Series, Davis hit a game tying, two-run home run
