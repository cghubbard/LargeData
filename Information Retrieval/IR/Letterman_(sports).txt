A letterman, in U.S. activities/sports, is a high school or college student 
who has met a specified level of participation or performance on a varsity 
team. The term comes from the practice of awarding each such participant 
a cloth "letter", which is usually the school's initial or initials, for 
placement on a "letter sweater" or "letter jacket" intended for the display 
of such an award. In some instances, the sweater or jacket itself may also 
be awarded, especially for the initial award to a given individual. Today, 
in order to distinguish "lettermen" from other team participants, schools 
often establish a minimum level of participation in a team's events or 
a minimum level of performance in order for a letter to be awarded. A common 
threshold in American football and basketball is participation in a set 
level, often half, of all quarters in a season. In individual sports such 
as tennis and golf, the threshold for lettering is generally participation 
in one half or sometimes two-thirds of all matches contested. Frequently, 
other members of the team who fail to meet requirements for a letter are 
awarded a certificate of participation or other award considered to be 
of lesser value than a letter. Some schools continue to base the awarding 
of letters according to performance, in team sports requiring a certain 
number of scores, steals, baskets or tackles, according to position and 
sport. In individual sports letters are often determined according to qualification 
for state meets or tournaments. Other schools award letters on a more subjective 
basis, with the head coach, usually with the input of other coaches and 
sometimes student team leaders who have already lettered, awarding letters 
for substantial improvement as well as significant performance on or off 
the field. This places much more emphasis on character, commitment and 
teamwork as well as, and often in place of, simply playing enough or meeting 
some other time or performance requirement. Sometimes in high schools academic 
performance in classes can also be an element. This philosophy gives more 
focus to developing and rewarding a well rounded and balanced player, where 
other methods focus strictly on athletic performance and on the field victories. 
This term is not gender-specific; a qualifying participant in women's basketball 
or other women's sports is properly referred to as a letterman, as would 
be a qualifying female participant on a co-educational sports team. An 
athlete who is awarded a letter (or letters in multiple sports) is said 
to have "lettered" when they receive their letter. In recent years, some 
schools have expanded the concept of letterman to outside of sports, providing 
letters for performance in performing arts, academics, or other school 
activities. A letter jacket is a jacket traditionally worn by high school 
and college students in the United States to represent school and team 
pride as well as to display personal awards earned in athletics, academics 
or activities. Letter jackets are also known as "varsity jackets" and "baseball 
jackets" in reference to their American origins. As letter jackets are 
for sale in the school shop, they can be purchased even by those who have 
not merited it. The body (i.e., torso) is usually of boiled wool and the 
sleeves of leather with banded wrists and waistband. Letter jackets are 
usually produced in the school colors with the body of the jacket in the 
school's primary color and sleeves in the secondary color. Although sometimes, 
the colors of the Jacket may be customized to a certain extent by the student. 
There could be cases where a student could change the color so much that 
it doesn't differentiate too much from school colors. They usually feature 
a banded collar for men or a hood for women. The letter jacket derives 
its name from the varsity letter chenille patch on its left breast, which 
is almost always the first letter or initials of the high school or college 
the jacket came from. The letter itself can also be custom fitted to the 
particular sport or activity (ex. Cross Country- a symbol or sign in the 
middle of the letter). The name of the owner usually appears either in 
chenille (matching the letter) or is embroidered on the jacket itself. 
The owner's graduation year typically appears in matching chenille. Placement 
of the name and year of graduation depends on school traditions. The year 
is most often sewn on the right sleeve or just above the right pocket. 
The school logo and symbols representing the student's activities may also 
be ironed on to the jacket. Lettermen who play on a championship team often 
receive a large patch commemorating their championship that is worn on 
the back of the jacket. Lettermen who participate in a sport in which medals 
are awarded often sew the medals onto their jackets to display their accomplishments. 
Varsity jackets trace their origins to letter sweaters, first introduced 
by the Harvard University baseball team in 1865.[1] The letter was usually 
quite large and centered (if the sweater was a pullover); stripes on one 
sleeve designated the number of letters won, with a star indicating a team 
captain. Letter jackets are almost never purchased before a student has 
earned a letter. In schools where only varsity letters are awarded this 
is usually the practice in a student's junior or senior year. Recently, 
however, many student athletes have been awarded letters during their sophomore 
and sometimes freshman year, leading to the need for a jacket much sooner. 
Still, the actual jacket isn't usually purchased until the sophomore year 
at least. In schools where junior varsity letters are awarded, the jacket 
may be purchased by junior varsity letter recipients, though the letter 
is placed just above the left pocket, leaving space for a future varsity 
letter. Some schools may award letter jackets to letter winners at the 
award ceremony, but more often the school only provides the letter. Some 
schools will have fund raising activities or other programs to provide 
jackets to students who cannot afford them. While it is commonly done, 
removing one's letter from the letter jacket upon graduation is not firmly 
held as protocol. Many graduates keep the letter on the jacket after graduation 
as a symbol of accomplishment and school pride and commitment, especially
