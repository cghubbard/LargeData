The 1974 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 93rd season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and its 83rd season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
86-75 during the season and finished second in the National League East, 
a game and-a-half behind the Pittsburgh Pirates. Outfielder Lou Brock led 
the NL with 118 stolen bases, breaking the modern-era (post-1898) MLB single-season 
mark of 104, set by Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Maury Wills in 1962. 
He also broke the all-time National League record of 111 set by John Montgomery 
Ward in 1887, when stolen bases were counted differently. Brock broke Wills' 
record on September 10 in a game against the visiting Philadelphia Phillies. 
Brock's record still stands as the NL record, but Rickey Henderson of the 
Oakland Athletics broke the modern MLB mark in 1982, with 130 steals. The 
all-time MLB record was, and still is, held by Hugh Nicol, who stole 138, 
also in 1887, while playing in the American Association. Outfielder Bake 
McBride won the Rookie of the Year Award this year, batting .309, with 
6 home runs and 56 RBIs. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: Pos = Position;
