A curfew is an order specifying a time during which certain regulations 
apply. [1][2] The word "curfew" comes from the French phrase "couvre-feu", 
which means "fire cover". It was later adopted into Middle English as "curfeu", 
which later became the modern "curfew".[3] Its original meaning refers 
to a law made by William The Conqueror that all lights and fires should 
be covered at the ringing of an eight o'clock bell to prevent the spread 
of destructive fire within communities in timber buildings.[4] On 28 January 
2011, and following the collapse of the police system, President Hosni 
Mubarak declared a country-wide military enforced curfew.[6] However, it 
was ignored by demonstrators who continued their sit-in in Tahrir Square. 
Concerned residents formed neighborhood vigilante groups to defend their 
communities against looters and the newly escaped prisoners.[7] On the 
second anniversary of the revolution, January 2013, a wave of demonstrations 
swept the country against President Mohamed Morsi who declared a curfew 
in Port Said, Ismaïlia, and Suez, three cities where deadly street clashes 
had occurred. In defiance, the locals took to the streets during the curfew,[8] 
organizing football tournaments and street festivals,[9] prohibiting police 
and military forces from enforcing the curfew. Under Iceland's Child Protection 
Act (no. 80/2002 Art. 92), children aged 12 and under may not be outdoors 
after 20:00 (8:00 p.m.) unless accompanied by an adult. Children aged 13 
to 16 may not be outdoors after 22:00 (10:00 p.m.), unless on their way 
home from a recognized event organized by a school, sports organization 
or youth club. During the period 1 May to 1 September, children may be 
outdoors for two hours longer. Children and teenagers that break curfew 
are taken to the local police station and police officers inform their 
parents to get them. The age limits stated here shall be based upon year 
of birth, not date of birth. If a parent cannot be reached, the child or 
teenager is taken to a shelter. The United Kingdom's 2003 Anti-Social Behaviour 
Act created zones that allow police from 9 PM to 6 AM to hold and escort 
home unaccompanied minors under the age of 16, whether badly behaved or 
not. Although hailed as a success,[10] the High Court ruled in one particular 
case that the law did not give the police a power of arrest, and officers 
could not force someone to come with them. On appeal the court of appeal 
held that the act gave police powers to escort minors home only if they 
are involved in, or at risk from, actual or imminently anticipated bad 
behaviour.[11] In a few towns in the United Kingdom, the curfew bell is 
still rung as a continuation of the medieval tradition where the bell used 
to be rung from the parish church to guide travelers safely towards a town 
or village as darkness fell, or when bad weather made it difficult to follow 
trackways and for the villagers to extinguish their lights and fires as 
a safety measure to combat accidental fires. Until 1100 it was against 
the law to burn any lights after the ringing of the curfew bell. In Morpeth, 
the curfew is rung each night at 8pm from Morpeth Clock Tower. In Chertsey, 
it is rung at 8pm, from Michaelmas to Lady Day.[12] A short story concerning 
the Chertsey curfew, set in 1471, and entitled "Blanche Heriot. A legend 
of old Chertsey Church" was published by Albert Richard Smith in 1843, 
and formed a basis for the poem "Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight". At Castleton 
in the Peak District, the curfew is rung from Michaelmas to Shrove Tuesday.[13] 
At Wallingford in Oxfordshire, the curfew bell continues to be rung at 
9pm rather than 8pm which is a one-hour extension granted by William The 
Conqueror as the Lord of the town was a Norman sympathiser. However, none 
of these curfew bells serve their original function. Curfew law in the 
United States is usually a matter of local ordinance (mainly applied by 
a municipality or county), rather than federal law. However, the Constitution 
guarantees certain rights, which have been applied to the states through 
the 14th Amendment. Hence, any curfew law may be overruled and struck down 
if, for example, it violates a juvenile's 1st, 4th, 5th or 14th Amendment 
rights. Nonetheless, curfews are set by state and local governments. They 
vary by state[14] and even by county or municipality. In some cities there 
are curfews for persons under the age of 18. American military curfews 
are a tool used by commanders at various installations to shape the behavior 
of soldiers.[15] The stated purpose of such laws is generally to deter 
disorderly behavior and crime, while others can include to protect youth 
from victimization and to strengthen parental responsibility[16] but their 
effectiveness is subject to debate. Generally, curfews attempt to address 
vandalism, shootings, and property crimes, which are believed to happen 
mostly at night, but are less commonly used to address underage drinking, 
drunk driving and teenage pregnancy. Parents can be fined, charged or ordered 
to take parenting classes for willingly, or through insufficient control 
or supervision, permitting the child to violate the curfew. Many local 
curfew laws were enacted in the 1950s and 1960s to attack the "juvenile 
delinquent" problem of youth gangs. Most curfew exceptions include: Some 
cities make it illegal for a business owner, operator, or any employee 
to knowingly allow a minor to remain in the establishment during curfew 
hours. A business owner, operator, or any employee may be also subject 
to fines.[17] There are also concerns about racial profiling.[18] A 2011 
UC-Berkeley study looked at the 54 larger U.S. cities that enacted youth 
curfews between 1985 and 2002 and found that arrests of youths affected 
by curfew restrictions dropped almost 15% in the first year and approximately 
10% in following years.[19] In response to concerns about racial profiling, 
Montgomery County, Maryland passed a limited curfew, which would permit 
police officers to arrest juveniles in situations that appear threatening.[20] 
Many malls in the United States have policies that prohibit minors under 
a specified age from entering the mall after specified times,[21] unless 
they are accompanied by a parent or another adult or are working at the 
mall during curfew times.[22] Such policies are known as mall curfews. 
Malls that have policies prohibiting unaccompanied minors at any time are 
known as parental escort policies.[23] States and municipalities in the 
United States have occasionally enacted curfews on the population at large, 
often as a result of severely inclement weather or political unrest. Some 
such curfews require all citizens simply to refrain from driving. Other 
require all citizens to remain inside, with exceptions granted to those 
in important positions, such as elected officials, law enforcement personnel, 
first responders, health care workers, and the mass media. In 2015, the 
city of Baltimore enacted a curfew on all citizens that lasted for five 
days and prohibited all citizens from going outdoors from 10 pm to 5 am 
with the exception of those traveling to or from work and those with medical 
emergencies. This was in response to the 2015 Baltimore protests. People
