As player As coach Charles Theodore "Chili" Davis (born January 17, 1960) 
is a Jamaican-American former baseball player and current coach. He is 
currently the hitting coach for the Boston Red Sox, a position he has held 
since October 2014. Davis is a former outfielder/designated hitter who 
played in Major League Baseball with the San Francisco Giants (1981–87), 
California Angels (1988–90, 1993–96), Minnesota Twins (1991–92), Kansas 
City Royals (1997) and New York Yankees (1998–99). His first major league 
coaching position was with the Oakland Athletics from 2012 to 2014. Davis 
was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. He is the first ballplayer 
born in Jamaica to appear in a major league game. Born in Kingston, Jamaica, 
Davis moved with his three brothers and sister to Los Angeles at the age 
of ten. Davis originally attended Fremont High School before transferring 
to Susan Miller Dorsey High School in Los Angeles. In high school, Davis 
played catcher and first base. Prior to his first year in the minor leagues, 
Davis was exclusively a right-handed hitter.[1] In a 19-year career, Davis 
was a .274 hitter with 350 home runs and 1,372 RBI in 2,436 games. Davis 
was an outfielder developed in the Giants minors system. In his first regular 
season in 1982, he hit .261 with 19 HR, 76 RBI and 24 stolen bases, and 
also led all National League outfielders in assists. In 1984 Davis finished 
third in NL batting average (.315), behind Tony Gwynn (.351) and Lee Lacy 
(.321). When he led the league in fielding errors in 1986, his nine errors 
tied the major league record for fewest errors by a category leader. After 
seven seasons in San Francisco, including two All-Star appearances in 1984 
and 1986, Davis signed with the Angels as a free agent before the 1988 
season. In his first two years with California, Davis hit 21 HR and 93 
RBI (in 1988), and then 22 HR and 90 RBI (in 1989). In 1990, hampered by 
chronic back problems and defensive shortcomings, Davis moved from full-time 
outfield duty to a DH role. After signing with Minnesota the following 
year, Davis remained a DH and would do so for the rest of his career. Davis 
contributed to the Twins with his switch-hitting ability, as the Twins' 
lineup already possessed right-handed batting Kirby Puckett and left-handed 
batting Kent Hrbek. Though he hit well from both sides of the plate, Davis 
performed better from the left side, as many switch hitters do due to their 
facing more right-handed pitching. In 1991 he led the Twins in home runs 
(29), RBI (93), doubles (34), walks (95), intentional walks (13), times 
on base (244), pitches seen (2,469), games played (153), slugging average 
(.507), on-base percentage (.385), OPS (.892), home run frequency (18.4 
at bat per HR), and most pitches seen per plate appearance (3.89). With 
these numbers, Davis helped Minnesota rise from a last-place finish the 
previous year to the AL West title. In the 1991 World Series, in which 
he hit two home runs, Davis and the Twins defeated the Atlanta Braves in 
seven games. Davis declined in production in 1992 (12 HR and 66 RBI), and 
as a free agent the following year returned to the Angels. Davis provided 
four years of solid production for California, including 27 HR and a career-high 
112 RBI in 1993. In 1994, he hit .311, with 26 HR and 84 RBI, and appeared 
in the All-Star game in the strike-shortened 1994 season. In 1995, he hit 
.318 with 20 HR and 86 RBI, and in 1996 hit .292, 28 HR and 96 RBI. In 
1997 he was traded to Kansas City for starter Mark Gubicza. In his one 
year with the Royals, Davis hit .279 with 90 RBI and a career-high 30 HR. 
Davis spent his final two seasons with the Yankees, winning his second 
and third World Series rings. He finished his career in 1999 hitting .269 
with 19 HR and 78 RBI. Davis finished his career with 350 home runs. That 
total ranks seventh all-time in home runs by a switch hitter, following 
Mickey Mantle, Eddie Murray, Chipper Jones, Mark Teixeira, Carlos Beltrán 
and Lance Berkman. Eleven times, Davis hit a home run from both sides of 
the plate in the same game and finished his career tied with Eddie Murray 
for first in this category, which has since been broken by Mark Teixeira, 
Nick Swisher and Carlos Beltrán. Davis played in the outfield from 1981 
to 1989. By 1990, he started to see more time as designated hitter in the 
American League. In 1993 he appeared as a pitcher for the only time in 
his career, pitching the final 2 innings of a game against the Texas Rangers. 
He faced 7 batters, while allowing no runs, no hits, and surrendering no 
walks (however he did hit a batter).[2] Davis was specifically a designated 
hitter from 1995 to 1999, and did not log any innings played in the field 
the final five seasons of his career.[3] Following his playing days, he 
was a hitting coach for the Australian National Baseball team for three 
years and was hired in 2010 by the Los Angeles Dodgers as a hitting coach 
for their instructional league. While there was speculation that he might 
be joining the Dodgers as a coach for the 2011 season, he instead joined 
the Pawtucket Red Sox's coaching staff as their new hitting coach.[6] On 
November 25, 2011, Davis was hired to be the Oakland Athletics hitting 
coach.[7] In October, 2014, he returned to the east coast, as the hitting 
coach for the Boston Red Sox.[8] Currently, Davis spends his time with 
his family and three sons in Arizona and California, and is employed with 
the Boston Red Sox as the team's hitting coach. He also has a sister named 
Olive who organized a fundraising event where Chili pitched to fund money 
for education.[9] The moniker "Chili" comes from Davis' childhood, when 
his father gave him a particularly poor bowl cut. Neighborhood children 
teased him that it looked as though someone had simply placed a chili bowl 
on his head to cut around, and the nickname stuck.[10] In 2014 he admitted
