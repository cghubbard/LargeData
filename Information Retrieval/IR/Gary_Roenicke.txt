Gary Steven Roenicke (born in Covina, California on December 5, 1954) is 
a former Major League Baseball outfielder for the Montreal Expos (1976), 
Baltimore Orioles (1978–85), New York Yankees (1986) and Atlanta Braves 
(1987–88). He was originally drafted by the Montreal Expos as the eighth 
pick of the first round of the 1973 amateur draft. He earned the MVP Award 
in the Eastern League (U.S. baseball) in 1975. A year later, he made his 
major league debut for the Montreal Expos, hitting .222 in 29 games with 
two home runs and five runs batted in. In 1977, Roenicke was traded with 
Joe Kerrigan and Don Stanhouse to the Baltimore Orioles for Rudy May, Randy 
Miller, and Bryn Smith. Roenicke appeared in 27 games in his first season 
with the Orioles in 1978. A year later, in his first full season, he had 
perhaps the best season of his career, appearing in 133 games and hitting 
.261 with 25 home runs and 64 runs batted in. He even made the top ten 
in at-bats per home run, with one home run every 15.0 AB. The next year, 
he hit .239 with 10 home runs, 28 runs batted in. In 1981 he hit .269, 
but his power numbers were still significantly down, slugging only .384, 
whereas he had slugged .508 in his rookie season. In 1982, he hit .270 
with a slugging percentage of .499 in 137 games, platooning with John Lowenstein 
and Benny Ayala.[1] Roenicke never established numbers like the 1982 season 
or rookie season. A year later, both his average and slugging were down 
and after two more years, the Orioles traded him to the New York Yankees 
for Rex Hudler. On the Yankees, his role was limited to a bench player 
and his power was down, with three home runs. He signed as a free agent 
in 1986 by the Atlanta Braves for less than half the amount of money he 
had been making ($380,000). He continued his career on the bench, this 
year doing better in the power department, hitting nine home runs. The 
next year, he hit .228 with a .298 slugging percentage, the worst of his 
career. He was released by the Braves on July 26, 1988 and retired. Roenicke 
resides in Rough and Ready, California, and is currently an adviser for 
the Western Canadian Baseball League, as well as a scout for the Orioles. 
His brother, Ron, had an eight-year career as an outfielder in the 1980s 
while his son Josh was a member of both the UCLA football and baseball 
teams as a wide receiver and outfielder. On the UCLA Bruins, Josh had the 
second-highest on-base percentage, third-highest batting average and compiled 
a perfect fielding percentage. Josh was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds, 
made his major-league baseball debut with the Reds as a pitcher on September
