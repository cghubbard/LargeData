The Bronx /ˈbrɒŋks/ is the northernmost of the five boroughs of New York 
City, within the U.S. state of New York. It is geographically south of 
Westchester County; north and east of the island and borough of Manhattan 
to the south and west across the Harlem River; and north of the borough 
of Queens, across the East River. Of the five boroughs, the Bronx is the 
only one that has the majority of its area on the U.S. mainland and, with 
a land area of 42 square miles (109 km2) and a population of 1,455,444 
in 2015,[1] has the fourth largest land area, the fourth highest population, 
and the third highest population density.[2] Since 1914, the Bronx has 
had the same boundaries as Bronx County, a county of New York and the third 
most densely populated county in the United States.[2] The Bronx is divided 
by the Bronx River into a hillier section in the west, closer to Manhattan, 
and a flatter eastern section, closer to Long Island. East and west street 
addresses are divided by Jerome Avenue—the continuation of Manhattan's 
Fifth Avenue. The West Bronx was annexed to New York City in 1874, and 
the areas east of the Bronx River in 1895.[3] Bronx County was separated 
from New York County in 1914.[4] About a quarter of the Bronx's area is 
open space,[5] including Woodlawn Cemetery, Van Cortlandt Park, Pelham 
Bay Park, the New York Botanical Garden and the Bronx Zoo in the borough's 
north and center. These open spaces are situated primarily on land deliberately 
reserved in the late 19th century as urban development progressed north 
and east from Manhattan. The name "Bronx" originated with Jonas Bronck, 
who established the first settlement in the area as part of the New Netherland 
colony in 1639.[6][7][8] The native Lenape were displaced after 1643 by 
settlers. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Bronx received many immigrant 
groups as it was transformed into an urban community, first from various 
European countries (particularly Ireland, Germany and Italy) and later 
from the Caribbean region (particularly Puerto Rico, Jamaica and the Dominican 
Republic), as well as African American migrants from the southern United 
States.[9] This cultural mix has made the Bronx a wellspring of both Latin 
music and hip hop. The Bronx contains one of the five poorest Congressional 
Districts in the United States, the 15th, but its wide diversity also includes 
affluent, upper-income and middle-income neighborhoods such as Riverdale, 
Fieldston, Spuyten Duyvil, Schuylerville, Pelham Bay, Pelham Gardens, Morris 
Park and Country Club.[10][11] The Bronx, particularly the South Bronx, 
saw a sharp decline in population, livable housing, and the quality of 
life in the late 1960s and the 1970s, culminating in a wave of arson. Since 
then the communities have shown significant redevelopment starting in the 
late 1980s before picking up pace from the 1990s until today.[12] The Bronx 
was called Rananchqua[13] by the native Siwanoy[14] band of Lenape (also 
known historically as the Delawares), while other Native Americans knew 
the Bronx as Keskeskeck.[15] It was divided by the Aquahung River. Jonas 
Bronck (c. 1600–43) was a Swedish born emigrant from Komstad, Norra Ljunga 
parish in Småland, Sweden who arrived in New Netherland during the spring 
of 1639.[8][16][17][18][19][20] Bronck became the first recorded European 
settler in the area now known as the Bronx and built a farm named "Emmanus" 
close to what today is the corner of Willis Avenue and 132nd Street in 
Mott Haven.[21] He leased land from the Dutch West India Company on the 
neck of the mainland immediately north of the Dutch settlement in Harlem 
(on Manhattan island), and bought additional tracts from the local tribes. 
He eventually accumulated 500 acres (200 ha) between the Harlem River and 
the Aquahung, which became known as Bronck's River or the Bronx [River]. 
Dutch and English settlers referred to the area as Bronck's Land.[16] The 
American poet William Bronk was a descendant of Pieter Bronck, either Jonas 
Bronck's son or his younger brother.[22] The Bronx is referred to, both 
legally[23] and colloquially,[24] with the definite article "the", as "the 
Bronx". The County of Bronx, unlike the coextensive Borough of the Bronx, 
does not place "the" immediately before "Bronx" in formal references, nor 
does the United States Postal Service in its database of Bronx addresses.[25] 
The name for this region, apparently after the Bronx River, first appeared 
in the "Annexed District of the Bronx" created in 1874 out of part of Westchester 
County and was continued in the "Borough of the Bronx", which included 
a larger annexation from Westchester County in 1898. The use of the definite 
article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers.[26][27] Another 
explanation for the use of the definite article in the borough's name is 
that the original form of the name was a possessive or collective one referring 
to the family, as in visiting "The Broncks", "The Bronck's" or "The Broncks"'.[28] 
The capitalization of the Bronx's name is sometimes disputed. Generally 
the definite article is lowercased in place names (e.g. "the Bronx"), except 
in official references to the borough; at the beginning of a sentence; 
or in any other situation when a normally-lowercase word would be capitalized 
(e.g. "The Bronx").[29] However, some people and groups, such as Lloyd 
Ultan, a Bronx County Historical Society historian, and the Great and Glorious 
Grand Army of The Bronx, a Bronx-based organization, refer to the borough 
with a capital letter at all times, since these people say that the definite 
article is part of the proper name.[30][31] In particular, the Great and 
Glorious Grand Army of The Bronx is leading efforts to try to make the 
city refer to the borough with an uppercase definite article at all mentions, 
comparing the grammatical lowercasing of the Bronx's name to "not capitalizing 
the 's' in 'Staten Island.'"[31] European colonization of the Bronx began 
in 1639. The Bronx was originally part of Westchester County, but it was 
ceded to New York County in fragments before it became Bronx County. Originally, 
the Bronx was inhabited by Native Americans until colonization turned the 
borough in to a farmland. The development of the Bronx is directly connected 
to its strategic location between New England and New York (Manhattan). 
Control over the bridges across the Harlem River plagued the period of 
British colonial rule. Kingsbridge, built in 1693 where Broadway reached 
the Spuyten Duyvil Creek, was a possession of Frederick Philipse, lord 
of Philipse Manor. The tolls were resented by local farmers on both sides 
of the creek. In 1759, the farmers led by Jacobus Dyckman and Benjamin 
Palmer built a "free bridge" across the Harlem River[32] which led to the 
abandonment of tolls altogether.[33] The territory now contained within 
Bronx County was originally part of Westchester County, one of the 12 original 
counties of the English Province of New York. The present Bronx County 
was contained in the town of Westchester and parts of the towns of Yonkers, 
Eastchester, and Pelham. In 1846, a new town, West Farms, was created by 
division of Westchester; in turn, in 1855, the town of Morrisania was created 
from West Farms. In 1873, the town of Kingsbridge (roughly corresponding 
to the modern Bronx neighborhoods of Kingsbridge, Riverdale, and Woodlawn) 
was established within the former borders of Yonkers. Among famous settlers 
in the Bronx in the 19th and early 20th centuries were the author Willa 
Cather, the tobacco merchant Pierre Lorillard, and the inventor Jordan 
L. Mott, who established Mott Haven to house the workers at his iron works.[34] 
The consolidation of the Bronx into New York City proceeded in two stages. 
In 1873, the state legislature annexed Kingsbridge, West Farms and Morrisania 
to New York, effective in 1874; the three towns were abolished in the process.[35][36] 
In 1895, three years before New York's consolidation with Brooklyn, Queens 
and Staten Island, the whole of the territory east of the Bronx River, 
including the Town of Westchester (which had voted in 1894 against consolidation) 
and portions of Eastchester and Pelham, were annexed to the city.[3][35][37][38][39] 
City Island, a nautical community, voted to join the city in 1896. On January 
1, 1898, the consolidated City of New York was born, including the Bronx 
as one of the five distinct Boroughs. (At the same time the Bronx's territory 
moved from Westchester County into New York County, which already contained 
Manhattan and the rest of pre-1874 New York City.) On April 19, 1912, those 
parts of New York County which had been annexed from Westchester County 
in the past decades were newly constituted as Bronx County, the 62nd and 
last county to be created by the state, effective in 1914.[35][40] Bronx 
County's courts opened for business on January 2, 1914 (the same day that 
John P. Mitchel started work as Mayor of New York City).[4] The South Bronx 
was for many years a manufacturing center, and in the early part of the 
20th Century was noted as a center of piano manufacturing. In 1919, the 
Bronx was the site of 63 piano factories employing more than 5,000 workers.[41] 
The history of the Bronx during the 20th century may be divided into four 
periods: a boom period during 1900–29, with a population growth by a factor 
of six from 200,000 in 1900 to 1.3 million in 1930. The Great Depression 
and post World War II years saw a slowing of growth leading into an eventual 
decline. The mid to late century were hard times, as the Bronx declined 
1950–85 from a predominantly moderate-income to a predominantly lower-income 
area with high rates of violent crime and poverty. The Bronx has experienced 
an economic and developmental resurgence starting in the late 1980s that 
continues into today.[44] For generations a mostly rural area of small 
farms supplying the city markets, the Bronx grew into a railroad suburb 
in the late 19th century. Faster transportation allowed for rapid population 
growth in the late 19th century, involving the move from horse-drawn street 
cars to elevated railways and the subway system, which linked to Manhattan 
in 1904.[44] The South Bronx was for many years a manufacturing center 
and in the early part of the 20th century was noted as a center of piano 
manufacturing. In 1919, the Bronx was the site of 63 piano factories employing 
more than 5,000 workers.[41] At the end of World War I, the Bronx hosted 
the rather small 1918 World's Fair at 177th Street and DeVoe Avenue.[3][45] 
The Bronx underwent rapid urban growth after World War I. Extensions of 
the New York City Subway contributed to the increase in population as thousands 
of immigrants came to the Bronx, resulting in a major boom in residential 
construction. Among these groups, many Irish Americans, Italian Americans 
and especially Jewish Americans settled here. In addition, French, German, 
Polish and other immigrants moved into the borough. The Jewish population 
also increased notably during this time. In 1937, according to Jewish organizations, 
592,185 Jews lived in The Bronx (43.9% of the borough's population),[46] 
while only 54,000 Jews lived in the borough in 2011. Many synagogues still 
stand in the Bronx, but most have been converted to other uses.[47] In 
Prohibition days (1920–33), bootleggers and gangs were active in the Bronx. 
Irish, Italian, Jewish and Polish gangs smuggled in most of the illegal 
whiskey. The oldest sections of the borough began to become poverty stricken 
areas. Between 1930 and 1960, moderate and upper income Bronxites (predominantly 
non-Hispanic Whites) rapidly began to relocate from the southwestern neighborhoods 
of the borough. This migration has left a mostly poor African American 
and Hispanic (largely Puerto Rican) population in the West Bronx. One significant 
factor that shifted the racial and economic demographics was the construction 
of Co-op City. Built with the intent of housing middle-class residents 
in family-sized apartments, the high-rise complex played a significant 
role in draining middle-class residents from older tenement buildings in 
the borough's southern and western fringes. Most predominantly non-Hispanic 
White communities today are located in the eastern and northwestern sections 
of the borough. From the early 1960s to the early 1980s, the quality of 
life for many Bronx residents declined sharply. Historians and social scientists 
have put forward many factors. They include the theory (elaborated in Robert 
Caro's biography The Power Broker)[48] that Robert Moses' Cross Bronx Expressway 
destroyed existing residential neighborhoods, creating instant slums. Another 
factor in the Bronx's decline may have been the development of high-rise 
housing projects, particularly in the South Bronx.[49] Yet another may 
have been a reduction in the real-estate listings and property-related 
financial services (such as mortgage loans or insurance policies) offered 
in some areas of the Bronx – a process known as redlining. Others have 
suggested a "planned shrinkage" of municipal services, such as fire-fighting.[50][51] 
There was also much debate as to whether rent control laws had made it 
less profitable (or more costly) for landlords to maintain existing buildings 
with their existing tenants than to abandon or destroy those buildings.[52] 
In the 1970s, the Bronx was plagued by a wave of arson. The burning of 
buildings was predominantly in the poorest communities, like the South 
Bronx. The most common explanation of what occurred was that landlords 
decided to burn their low property-value buildings and take the insurance 
money as it was more lucrative to get insurance money than to refurbish 
or sell a building in a severely distressed area.[53] The Bronx became 
identified with a high rate of poverty and unemployment, which was mainly 
a persistent problem in the South Bronx.[54] Out of 289 census tracts in 
the Bronx borough, 7 tracts lost more than 97% of their buildings to fire 
and abandonment between 1970 and 1980; another 44 tracts had more than 
50% of their buildings meet the same fate. By the early 1980s, the South 
Bronx was considered one of the most blighted urban areas in the country, 
with a loss of 60% of the population and 40% of housing units. However, 
starting in the 1990s, many burned-out and run-down tenements were replaced 
by multi-unit housing.[54] Since the late 1980s, significant development 
has occurred in the Bronx, first stimulated by the city's "Ten-Year Housing 
Plan"[55][56] and community members working to rebuild the social, economic 
and environmental infrastructure by creating affordable housing. Groups 
affiliated with churches in the South Bronx erected the Nehemiah Homes 
with about 1,000 units. The grass roots organization Nos Quedamos' endeavor 
known as Melrose Commons[57][58][59] began to rebuild areas in the South 
Bronx.[60] The IRT White Plains Road Line (2 5 trains) began to show an 
increase in riders. Chains such as Marshalls, Staples, and Target opened 
stores in the Bronx. More bank branches opened in the Bronx as a whole 
(rising from 106 in 1997 to 149 in 2007), although not primarily in poor 
or minority neighborhoods, while the Bronx still has fewer branches per 
person than other boroughs.[61][62][63][64] In 1997, the Bronx was designated 
an All America City by the National Civic League, acknowledging its comeback 
from the decline of the mid-century.[65] In 2006, The New York Times reported 
that "construction cranes have become the borough's new visual metaphor, 
replacing the window decals of the 1980s in which pictures of potted plants 
and drawn curtains were placed in the windows of abandoned buildings."[66] 
The borough has experienced substantial new building construction since 
2002. Between 2002 and June 2007, 33,687 new units of housing were built 
or were under way and $4.8 billion has been invested in new housing. In 
the first six months of 2007 alone total investment in new residential 
development was $965 million and 5,187 residential units were scheduled 
to be completed. Much of the new development is springing up in formerly 
vacant lots across the South Bronx.[67] In addition, there is a revitalization 
of the existing housing market in areas such as Hunts Point, the Lower 
Concourse, and the neighborhoods surrounding the Third Avenue Bridge as 
people buy apartments and renovate them.[68] Several boutique and chain 
hotels have opened in recent years in the South Bronx.[69] New developments 
are underway. The Bronx General Post Office[70][71] on the corner of the 
Grand Concourse and East 149th Street is being converted into a market 
place, boutiques, restaurants and office space with a USPS concession.[72] 
The Kingsbridge Armory, often cited as the largest armory in the world, 
is scheduled for redevelopment as the Kingsbridge National Ice Center.[73] 
Under consideration for future development is the construction of a platform 
over the New York City Subway's Concourse Yard adjacent to Lehman College. 
The construction would permit approximately 2,000,000 square feet (190,000 m2) 
of development and would cost US$350–500 million.[74] In addition, a La 
Quinta Inn has been proposed for the Mott Haven waterfront.[75] According 
to the U.S. Census Bureau, Bronx County has a total area of 57 square miles 
(150 km2), of which 42 square miles (110 km2) is land and 15 square miles 
(39 km2) (27%) is water.[77] The Bronx is almost entirely situated on the 
North American mainland.[78] Its bedrock is primarily Fordham gneiss, a 
high-grade heavily-banded metamorphic rock containing significant amounts 
of pink feldspar.[79] Marble Hill – politically part of Manhattan but now 
physically attached to the Bronx – is so-called because of the formation 
of Inwood Marble there as well as in Inwood, Manhattan and parts of the 
Bronx and Westchester County. The Hudson River separates the Bronx on the 
west from Alpine, Tenafly and Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County, New Jersey; 
the Harlem River separates it from the island of Manhattan to the southwest; 
the East River separates it from Queens to the southeast; and to the east, 
Long Island Sound separates it from Nassau County in western Long Island. 
Directly north of the Bronx are (from west to east) the adjoining Westchester 
County communities of Yonkers, Mount Vernon, Pelham Manor and New Rochelle. 
(There is also a short southern land boundary with Marble Hill in the Borough 
of Manhattan, over the filled-in former course of the Spuyten Duyvil Creek. 
Marble Hill's postal ZIP code, telephonic Area Code and fire service, however, 
are shared with the Bronx and not Manhattan.) The Bronx River flows south 
from Westchester County through the borough, emptying into the East River; 
it is the only entirely freshwater river in New York City.[80] A smaller 
river, the Hutchinson River (named after the religious leader Anne Hutchinson, 
killed along its banks in 1641), passes through the East Bronx and empties 
into Eastchester Bay. The Bronx also includes several small islands in 
the East River and Long Island Sound, such as City Island and Hart Island. 
Rikers Island in the East River, home to the large jail complex for the 
entire city, is also part of the Bronx. The Bronx's highest elevation at 
280 feet (85 m) is in the northwest corner, west of Van Cortlandt Park 
and in the Chapel Farm area near the Riverdale Country School.[81] The 
opposite (southeastern) side of the Bronx has four large low peninsulas 
or "necks" of low-lying land that jut into the waters of the East River 
and were once salt marsh: Hunt's Point, Clason's Point, Screvin's Neck 
and Throg's Neck. Further up the coastline, Rodman's Neck lies between 
Pelham Bay Park in the northeast and City Island. The Bronx's irregular 
shoreline extends for 75 square miles (194 km2).[82] Although Bronx County 
was the third most densely populated county in the United States as of 
2006 (after Manhattan and Brooklyn),[2] 7,000 acres (28 km2) of the Bronx—about 
one-fifth of the Bronx's area, and one-quarter of its land area—is given 
over to parkland.[5] The vision of a system of major Bronx parks connected 
by park-like thoroughfares is usually attributed to John Mullaly. Woodlawn 
Cemetery, one of the largest cemeteries in New York City, sits on the western 
bank of the Bronx River near Yonkers. It opened in 1863, at a time when 
the Bronx was still considered a rural area. The northern side of the borough 
includes the largest park in New York City—Pelham Bay Park, which includes 
Orchard Beach—and the fourth largest, Van Cortlandt Park, which is west 
of Woodlawn Cemetery and borders Yonkers. Also in the northern Bronx, Wave 
Hill, the former estate of George W. Perkins—known for a historic house, 
gardens, changing site-specific art installations and concerts—overlooks 
the New Jersey Palisades from a promontory on the Hudson in Riverdale. 
Nearer the borough's center, and along the Bronx River, is Bronx Park; 
its northern end houses the New York Botanical Gardens, which preserve 
the last patch of the original hemlock forest that once covered the entire 
county, and its southern end the Bronx Zoo, the largest urban zoological 
gardens in the United States.[84] Just south of Van Cortlandt Park is the 
Jerome Park Reservoir, surrounded by 2 miles (3 km) of stone walls and 
bordering several small parks in the Bedford Park neighborhood; the reservoir 
was built in the 1890s on the site of the former Jerome Park Racetrack.[85] 
Further south is Crotona Park, home to a 3.3-acre (1.3 ha) lake, 28 species 
of trees, and a large swimming pool.[86] The land for these parks, and 
many others, was bought by New York City in 1888, while land was still 
open and inexpensive, in anticipation of future needs and future pressures 
for development.[87] Some of the acquired land was set aside for the Grand 
Concourse and Pelham Parkway, the first of a series of boulevards and parkways 
(thoroughfares lined with trees, vegetation and greenery). Later projects 
included the Bronx River Parkway, which developed a road while restoring 
the riverbank and reducing pollution, Mosholu Parkway and the Henry Hudson 
Parkway. In 2006, a five-year, $220-million program of capital improvements 
and natural restoration in 70 Bronx parks was begun (financed by water 
and sewer revenues) as part of an agreement that allowed a water filtration 
plant under Mosholu Golf Course in Van Cortlandt Park. One major focus 
is on opening more of the Bronx River's banks and restoring them to a natural 
state.[88] The number, locations, and boundaries of the Bronx's neighborhoods 
(many of them sitting on the sites of 19th-century villages) have become 
unclear with time and successive waves of newcomers. In 2006, Manny Fernandez 
of The New York Times wrote, According to a Department of City Planning 
map of the city's neighborhoods, the Bronx has 49. The map publisher Hagstrom 
identifies 69. The borough president, Adolfo Carrión Jr., says 61. The 
Mayor's Community Assistance Unit, in a listing of the borough's community 
boards, names 68. Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, lists 44.[a][89] 
Notable Bronx neighborhoods include the South Bronx; Little Italy on Arthur 
Avenue in the Belmont section; and Riverdale. (Bronx Community Boards 9 
[south central], 10 [east], 11 [east central] and 12 [north central] )[90] 
East of the Bronx River, the borough is relatively flat and includes four 
large low peninsulas, or 'necks,' of low-lying land which jut into the 
waters of the East River and were once saltmarsh: Hunts Point, Clason's 
Point, Screvin's Neck (Castle Hill Point) and Throgs Neck. The East Bronx 
has older tenement buildings, low income public housing complexes, and 
multifamily homes, as well as single family homes. It includes New York 
City's largest park: Pelham Bay Park along the Westchester-Bronx border. 
Neighborhoods include: Clason's Point, Harding Park, Soundview, Castle 
Hill, Parkchester (Board 9); Throggs Neck, Country Club, City Island, Pelham 
Bay, Edgewater Park, Co-op City (Board 10); Westchester Square, Van Nest, 
Pelham Parkway, Morris Park (Board 11); Williamsbridge, Eastchester, Baychester, 
Edenwald and Wakefield (Board 12). (Bronx Community Board 10) City Island 
is located east of Pelham Bay Park in Long Island Sound and is known for 
its seafood restaurants and private waterfront homes.[91] City Island's 
single shopping street, City Island Avenue, is reminiscent of a small New 
England town. It is connected to Rodman's Neck on the mainland by the City 
Island Bridge. East of City Island is Hart Island, which is uninhabited 
and not open to the public. It once served as a prison and now houses New 
York City's Potter's Field or pauper's graveyard for unclaimed bodies.[92] 
(Bronx Community Boards 1 to 8, progressing roughly from south to northwest) 
The western parts of the Bronx are hillier and are dominated by a series 
of parallel ridges, running south to north. The West Bronx has older apartment 
buildings, low income public housing complexes, multifamily homes in its 
lower income areas as well as larger single family homes in more affluent 
areas such as Riverdale and Fieldston.[93] It includes New York City's 
fourth largest park: Van Cortlandt Park along the Westchester-Bronx border. 
The Grand Concourse, a wide boulevard, runs through it, north to south. 
(Bronx Community Boards 7 [between the Bronx and Harlem Rivers] and 8 [facing 
the Hudson River] – plus part of Board 12) Neighborhoods include: Fordham-Bedford, 
Bedford Park, Norwood, Kingsbridge Heights (Board 7), Kingsbridge, Riverdale 
(Board 8), and Woodlawn (Board 12). (Marble Hill, Manhattan is now connected 
by land to the Bronx rather than Manhattan and is served by Bronx Community 
Board 8.) (Bronx Community Boards 1 to 6 plus part of Board 7—progressing 
northwards, Boards 2, 3 and 6 border the Bronx River from its mouth to 
Bronx Park, while 1, 4, 5 and 7 face Manhattan across the Harlem River) 
Like other neighborhoods in New York City, the South Bronx has no official 
boundaries. The name has been used to represent poverty in the Bronx and 
applied to progressively more northern places so that by the 2000s Fordham 
Road was often used as a northern limit. The Bronx River more consistently 
forms an eastern boundary. The South Bronx has many high-density apartment 
buildings, low income public housing complexes, and multi-unit homes. The 
South Bronx is home to the Bronx County Courthouse, Borough Hall, and other 
government buildings, as well as Yankee Stadium. The Cross Bronx Expressway 
bisects it, east to west. The South Bronx has some of the poorest neighborhoods 
in the country, as well as very high crime areas. Neighborhoods include: 
The Hub (a retail district at Third Avenue and East 149th Street), Port 
Morris, Mott Haven (Board 1), Melrose (Board 1 & Board 3), Morrisania, 
East Morrisania [also known as Crotona Park East] (Board 3), Hunts Point, 
Longwood (Board 2), Highbridge, Concourse (Board 4), West Farms, Belmont, 
East Tremont (Board 6), Tremont, Morris Heights (Board 5), University Heights, 
and Fordham (Board 5 & Board 7). Prominent shopping areas in the Bronx 
include Fordham Road, Bay Plaza in Co-op City, The Hub, the Riverdale/Kingsbridge 
shopping center, and Bruckner Boulevard. Shops are also concentrated on 
streets aligned underneath elevated railroad lines, including Westchester 
Avenue, White Plains Road, Jerome Avenue, Southern Boulevard, and Broadway. 
The Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market contains several big-box stores, 
which opened in 2009 south of Yankee Stadium. There are three primary shopping 
centers in the Bronx: The Hub, Gateway Center and Southern Boulevard. The 
Hub–Third Avenue Business Improvement District (B.I.D.), in The Hub, is 
the retail heart of the South Bronx, located where four roads converge: 
East 149th Street, Willis, Melrose and Third Avenues.[94] It is primarily 
located inside the neighborhood of Melrose but also lines the northern 
border of Mott Haven.[95] The Hub has been called "the Broadway of the 
Bronx", being likened to the real Broadway in Manhattan and the northwestern 
Bronx.[96] It is the site of both maximum traffic and architectural density. 
In configuration, it resembles a miniature Times Square, a spatial "bow-tie" 
created by the geometry of the street.[97] The Hub is part of Bronx Community 
Board 1. The Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market, in the West Bronx, 
is a shopping center that encompasses less than one million square feet 
of retail space, built on a 17 acres (7 ha) site that formerly held the 
Bronx Terminal Market, a wholesale fruit and vegetable market as well as 
the former Bronx House of Detention, south of Yankee Stadium. The $500 
million shopping center, which was completed in 2009, saw the construction 
of new buildings and two smaller buildings, one new and the other a renovation 
of an existing building that was part of the original market. The two main 
buildings are linked by a six-level garage for 2,600 cars. The center has 
earned itself a LEED "Silver" designation in its design.[98] The Bronx 
adjoins:[99] The Bronx street grid is irregular. Like the northernmost 
part of upper Manhattan, the West Bronx's hilly terrain leaves a relatively 
free-style street grid. Much of the West Bronx's street numbering carries 
over from upper Manhattan, but does not match it exactly; East 132nd Street 
is the lowest numbered street in the Bronx. This dates from the mid-19th 
century when the southwestern area of Westchester County west of the Bronx 
River, was incorporated into New York City and known as the Northside. 
The East Bronx is considerably flatter, and the street layout tends to 
be more regular. Only the Wakefield neighborhood picks up the street numbering, 
albeit at a disalignment due to Tremont Avenue's layout. At the same diagonal 
latitude, West 262nd Street in Riverdale matches East 237th Street in Wakefield. 
Three major north-south thoroughfares run between Manhattan and the Bronx: 
Third Avenue, Park Avenue, and Broadway. Other major north-south roads 
include the Grand Concourse, Jerome Avenue, Sedgwick Avenue, Webster Avenue, 
and White Plains Road. Major east-west thoroughfares include Mosholu Parkway, 
Gun Hill Road, Fordham Road, Pelham Parkway, and Tremont Avenue. Most east-west 
streets are prefixed with either East or West, to indicate on which side 
of Jerome Avenue they lie (continuing the similar system in Manhattan, 
which uses Fifth Avenue as the dividing line).[100] The historic Boston 
Post Road, part of the long pre-revolutionary road connecting Boston with 
other northeastern cities, runs east-west in some places, and sometimes 
northeast-southwest. Mosholu and Pelham Parkways, with Bronx Park between 
them, Van Cortlandt Park to the west and Pelham Bay Park to the east, are 
also linked by bridle paths. As of the 2000 Census, approximately 61.6% 
of all Bronx households do not have access to a car. Citywide, the percentage 
of autoless households is 55%.[101] Several major limited access highways 
traverse the Bronx. These include: Thirteen bridges and three tunnels connect 
the Bronx to Manhattan, and three bridges connect the Bronx to Queens. 
These include, from west to east: To Manhattan: the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge, 
the Henry Hudson Bridge, the Broadway Bridge, the University Heights Bridge, 
the Washington Bridge, the Alexander Hamilton Bridge, the High Bridge, 
the Concourse Tunnel, the Macombs Dam Bridge, the 145th Street Bridge, 
the 149th Street Tunnel, the Madison Avenue Bridge, the Park Avenue Bridge, 
the Lexington Avenue Tunnel, the Third Avenue Bridge (southbound traffic 
only), and the Willis Avenue Bridge (northbound traffic only). To both 
Manhattan and Queens: the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, formerly known as the 
Triborough Bridge. To Queens: the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge and the Throgs 
Neck Bridge. The Bronx is served by six lines of the New York City Subway 
with 70 stations in the Bronx: Two Metro-North Railroad commuter rail lines 
(the Harlem Line and the Hudson Line) serve 11 stations in the Bronx. (Marble 
Hill, between the Spuyten Duyvil and University Heights stations, is actually 
in the only part of Manhattan connected to the mainland.) In addition, 
trains serving the New Haven Line stop at Fordham Road. According to a 
2013 Census Bureau estimate,[102] 45.8% of the Bronx's population was white, 
43.3% was black or African American, 4.2% Asian, 3.0% American Indian, 
0.4% Pacific Islander, and 3.3% of two or more races. In addition, 54.6% 
of the population was of Hispanic or Latino origin, of any race. The Census 
Bureau considers the Bronx to be the most diverse area in the country. 
There is an 89.7 percent chance that any two residents, chosen at random, 
would be of different race or ethnicity.[105] The borough's most populous 
racial group, white, declined from 98.3% in 1940 to 45.8% in 2013.[102] 
31.7% of the population were foreign born and another 8.9% were born in 
Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parents. 55.6% 
spoke a language other than English at home and 16.4% had a bachelor's 
degree or higher.[106] Approximately 44.3% of the population over the age 
of five spoke only English at home, which is roughly 570,000 people. The 
majority (55.7%) of the population spoke a language other than English 
at home. Over 580,600 people (45.2% of the population) spoke Spanish at 
home.[107][108] According to the 2010 Census, 53.5% of Bronx's population 
was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race); 30.1% 
non-Hispanic Black or African American, 10.9% of the population was non-Hispanic 
White, 3.4% non-Hispanic Asian, 0.6% from some other race (non-Hispanic) 
and 1.2% of two or more races (non-Hispanic). The U.S. Census considers 
the Bronx to be the most diverse area in the country. There is an 89.7 
percent chance that any two residents, chosen at random, would be of different 
race or ethnicity.[105] As of 2010, 46.29% (584,463) of Bronx residents 
aged five and older spoke Spanish at home, while 44.02% (555,767) spoke 
English, 2.48% (31,361) African languages, 0.91% (11,455) French, 0.90% 
(11,355) Italian, 0.87% (10,946) various Indic languages, 0.70% (8,836) 
other Indo-European languages, and Chinese was spoken at home by 0.50% 
(6,610) of the population over the age of five. In total, 55.98% (706,783) 
of the Bronx's population age five and older spoke a language at home other 
than English.[110] A Garifuna-speaking community from Honduras and Guatemala 
also makes the Bronx its home.[111] According to the 2009 American Community 
Survey, White Americans of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented 
over one-fifth (22.9%) of the Bronx's population. However, non-Hispanic 
whites formed under one-eighth (12.1%) of the population, down from 34.4% 
in 1980.[103] Out of all five boroughs, the Bronx has the lowest number 
and percentage of white residents. 320,640 whites called the Bronx home, 
of which 168,570 were non-Hispanic whites. The majority of the non-Hispanic 
European American population is of Italian and Irish descent. People of 
Italian descent numbered over 55,000 individuals and made up 3.9% of the 
population. People of Irish descent numbered over 43,500 individuals and 
made up 3.1% of the population. German Americans and Polish Americans made 
up 1.4% and 0.8% of the population respectively. The Bronx is the only 
New York City borough with a Hispanic majority, many of whom are Puerto 
Ricans and Dominicans. At the 2009 American Community Survey, Black Americans 
made the second largest group in the Bronx after Hispanics and Latinos. 
Blacks of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-third 
(35.4%) of the Bronx's population. Blacks of non-Hispanic origin made up 
30.8% of the population. Over 495,200 blacks resided in the borough, of 
which 430,600 were non-Hispanic blacks. Over 61,000 people identified themselves 
as "Sub-Saharan African" in the survey, making up 4.4% of the population. 
Native Americans are a very small minority in the borough. Only some 5,560 
individuals (out of the borough's 1.4 million people) are Native American, 
which is equal to just 0.4% of the population. In addition, roughly 2,500 
people are Native Americans of non-Hispanic origin. In 2009, Hispanic and 
Latino Americans represented 52.0% of the Bronx's population. Puerto Ricans 
represented 23.2% of the borough's population. Over 72,500 Mexicans lived 
in the Bronx, and they formed 5.2% of the population. Cubans numbered over 
9,640 members and formed 0.7% of the population. In addition, over 319,000 
people were of various Hispanic and Latino groups, such as Dominican, Salvadoran, 
and so on. These groups collectively represented 22.9% of the population. 
At the 2010 Census, 53.5% of Bronx's population was of Hispanic, Latino, 
or Spanish origin (they may be of any race). Asian Americans are a small 
but sizable minority in the borough. Roughly 49,600 Asians make up 3.6% 
of the population. Roughly 13,600 Indians call the Bronx home, along with 
9,800 Chinese, 6,540 Filipinos, 2,260 Vietnamese, 2,010 Koreans, and 1,100 
Japanese. Multiracial Americans are also a sizable minority in the Bronx. 
People of multiracial heritage number over 41,800 individuals and represent 
3.0% of the population. People of mixed Caucasian and African American 
heritage number over 6,850 members and form 0.5% of the population. People 
of mixed Caucasian and Native American heritage number over 2,450 members 
and form 0.2% of the population. People of mixed Caucasian and Asian heritage 
number over 880 members and form 0.1% of the population. People of mixed 
African American and Native American heritage number over 1,220 members 
and form 0.1% of the population. The Census of 1930 counted only 1.0% (12,930) 
of the Bronx's population as Negro (while making no distinct counts of 
Hispanic or Spanish-surname residents).[42] At the 2010 Census, there were, 
1,385,108 people living in Bronx, a 3.9% increase since 2000. As of the 
United States Census[112] of 2000, there were 1,332,650 people, 463,212 
households, and 314,984 families residing in the borough. The population 
density was 31,709.3 inhabitants per square mile (12,242.2/km²). There 
were 490,659 housing units at an average density of 11,674.8 per square 
mile (4,507.4/km²).[112] Recent Census estimates place total population 
of Bronx county at 1,392,002 as of 2012.[113] There were 463,212 households 
out of which 38.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.4% 
were married couples living together, 30.4% had a female householder with 
no husband present, and 32.0% were non-families. 27.4% of all households 
were made up of individuals and 9.4% had someone living alone who was 65 
years of age or older. The average household size was 2.78 and the average 
family size was 3.37.[112] The age distribution of the population in the 
Bronx was as follows: 29.8% under the age of 18, 10.6% from 18 to 24, 30.7% 
from 25 to 44, 18.8% from 45 to 64, and 10.1% 65 years of age or older. 
The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females there were 87.0 males.[112] 
The 1999 median income for a household in the borough was $27,611, and 
the median income for a family was $30,682. Males had a median income of 
$31,178 versus $29,429 for females. The per capita income for the borough 
was $13,959. About 28.0% of families and 30.7% of the population were below 
the poverty line, including 41.5% of those under age 18 and 21.3% of those 
age 65 or over. Since New York City's consolidation in 1898, the Bronx 
has been governed by the New York City Charter that provides for a "strong" 
mayor-council system. The centralized New York City government is responsible 
for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, 
recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services 
in the Bronx. The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation 
of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority. Each borough president 
had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New 
York City Board of Estimate, which was responsible for creating and approving 
the city's budget and proposals for land use. In 1989 the Supreme Court 
of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on 
the grounds that Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater effective 
representation on the Board than Staten Island, the least populous borough, 
a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause pursuant 
to the high court's 1964 "one man, one vote" decision.[114] Since 1990 
the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral 
agencies, the City Council, the New York state government, and corporations. 
Until March 1, 2009, the Borough President of the Bronx was Adolfo Carrión 
Jr., elected as a Democrat in 2001 and 2005 before retiring early to direct 
the White House Office of Urban Affairs Policy. His successor, Democratic 
New York State Assembly member Rubén Díaz, Jr., who won a special election 
on April 21, 2009 by a vote of 86.3% (29,420) on the "Bronx Unity" line 
to 13.3% (4,646) for the Republican district leader Anthony Ribustello 
on the "People First" line,[115][116] became Borough President on May 1. 
All of the Bronx's currently elected public officials have first won the 
nomination of the Democratic Party (in addition to any other endorsements). 
Local party platforms center on affordable housing, education and economic 
development. Controversial political issues in the Bronx include environmental 
issues, the cost of housing, and annexation of parkland for new Yankee 
Stadium. Since its separation from New York County on January 1, 1914, 
the Bronx, has had, like each of the other 61 counties of New York State, 
its own criminal court system[4] and District Attorney, the chief public 
prosecutor who is directly elected by popular vote. Robert T. Johnson, 
a Democrat, has been the District Attorney of Bronx County since 1989. 
He was the first African-American District Attorney in New York State. 
Eight members of the New York City Council represent districts wholly within 
the Bronx (11–18), while a ninth represents a Manhattan district (8) that 
also includes a small area of the Bronx. One of those members, Joel Rivera 
(District 15), has been the Council's Majority Leader since 2002. In 2008, 
all of them were Democrats. The Bronx also has twelve Community Boards, 
appointed bodies that field complaints and advise on land use and municipal 
facilities and services for local residents, businesses and institutions. 
(They are listed at Bronx Community Boards). In 2008, three Democrats represented 
almost all of the Bronx in the United States House of Representatives. 
All of these Representatives won over 75% of their districts' respective 
votes in both 2004 and 2006. National Journal's neutral rating system placed 
all of their voting records in 2005 and 2006 somewhere between very liberal 
and extremely liberal.[10][11] 11 out of 150 members of the New York State 
Assembly (the lower house of the state legislature) represent districts 
wholly within the Bronx. Six State Senators out of 62 represent Bronx districts, 
half of them wholly within the County, and half straddling other counties. 
All these legislators are Democrats who won between 65% and 100% of their 
districts' vote in 2006.[117] In the 2004 presidential election, Senator 
John F. Kerry received 81.8% of the vote in the Bronx (79.8% on the Democratic 
line plus 2% on the Working Families Party's line) while President George 
W. Bush received 16.3% (15.5% Republican plus 0.85% Conservative). In the 
2008 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama improved on Kerry's showing, 
and took 88.7% of the vote in the Bronx to Republican John McCain's 10.9%. 
In 2005, the Democratic former Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer 
won 59.8% of the borough's vote against 38.8% (35.3% Republican, 3.5% Independence 
Party) for Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who carried every other borough in 
his winning campaign for re-election. In 2006, successfully reelected Senator 
Hillary Clinton won 89.5% of the Bronx's vote (82.8% Dem. + 4.1% Working 
Families + 2.6% Independence) against Yonkers ex-Mayor John Spencer's 9.6% 
(8.2% Republican + 1.4% Cons.), while Eliot Spitzer won 88.8% of the Borough's 
vote (82.1% Dem. + 4.1% Working Families + 2.5% Independence Party) in 
winning the Governorship against John Faso, who received 9.7% of the Bronx's 
vote (8.2% Republican + 1.5% Cons.)[118] In the Presidential primary elections 
of February 5, 2008, Sen. Clinton won 61.2% of the Bronx's 148,636 Democratic 
votes against 37.8% for Barack Obama and 1.0% for the other four candidates 
combined (John Edwards, Dennis Kucinich, Bill Richardson and Joe Biden). 
On the same day, John McCain won 54.4% of the borough's 5,643 Republican 
votes, Mitt Romney 20.8%, Mike Huckabee 8.2%, Ron Paul 7.4%, Rudy Giuliani 
5.6%, and the other candidates (Fred Thompson, Duncan Hunter and Alan Keyes) 
3.6% between them.[119] After becoming a separate county in 1914, the Bronx 
has supported only two Republican Presidential candidates. It voted heavily 
for the winning Republican Warren G. Harding in 1920, but much more narrowly 
on a split vote for his victorious Republican successor Calvin Coolidge 
in 1924 (Coolidge 79,562; John W. Davis, Dem., 72,834; Robert La Follette, 
62,202 equally divided between the Progressive and Socialist lines). Since 
then, the Bronx has always supported the Democratic Party's nominee for 
President, starting with a vote of 2–1 for the unsuccessful Al Smith in 
1928, followed by four 2–1 votes for the successful Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
(Both had been Governors of New York, but Republican former Gov. Thomas 
E. Dewey won only 28% of the Bronx's vote in 1948 against 55% for Pres. 
Harry Truman, the winning Democrat, and 17% for Henry A. Wallace of the 
Progressives. It was only 32 years earlier, by contrast, that another Republican 
former Governor who narrowly lost the Presidency, Charles Evans Hughes, 
had won 42.6% of the Bronx's 1916 vote against Democratic President Woodrow 
Wilson's 49.8% and Socialist candidate Allan Benson's 7.3%.)[120] The Bronx 
has often shown striking differences from other boroughs in elections for 
Mayor. The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was Fiorello La 
Guardia in 1933, 1937 and 1941 (and in the latter two elections, only because 
his 30% to 32% vote on the American Labor Party line was added to 22% to 
23% as a Republican).[121] The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried 
by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors Rudolph Giuliani 
in 1997 and Michael Bloomberg in 2005. The anti-war Socialist campaign 
of Morris Hillquit in the 1917 mayoral election won over 31% of the Bronx's 
vote, putting him second and well ahead of the 20% won by the incumbent 
pro-war Fusion Mayor John P. Mitchel, who came in second (ahead of Hillquit) 
everywhere else and outpolled Hillquit city-wide by 23.2% to 21.7%.[122] 
Education in the Bronx is provided by a large number of public and private 
institutions, many of which draw students who live beyond the Bronx. The 
New York City Department of Education manages public noncharter schools 
in the borough. In 2000, public schools enrolled nearly 280,000 of the 
Bronx's residents over 3 years old (out of 333,100 enrolled in all pre-college 
schools).[123] There are also several public charter schools. Private schools 
range from élite independent schools to religiously affiliated schools 
run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and Jewish organizations. 
A small portion of land that is between Pelham and Pelham Bay Park, with 
a total of 35 houses, is a part of the Bronx, but is cut off from the rest 
of the borough due to the way the county boundaries were established; the 
New York City government pays for the residents' children to go to Pelham 
Union Free School District schools, including Pelham Memorial High School, 
since that is more cost effective than sending school buses to take the 
students to New York City schools. This arrangement has been in place since 
1948.[124] In 2000, according to the U.S. Census, out of the nearly 800,000 
people in the Bronx who were then at least 25 years old, 62.3% had graduated 
from high school and 14.6% held a bachelor's or higher college degree. 
These percentages were lower than those for New York's other boroughs, 
which ranged from 68.8% (Brooklyn) to 82.6% (Staten Island) for high school 
graduates over 24, and from 21.8% (Brooklyn) to 49.4% (Manhattan) for college 
graduates. (The respective state and national percentages were [NY] 79.1% 
& 27.4% and [US] 80.4% & 24.4%.)[125] In the 2000 Census, 79,240 of the 
nearly 95,000 Bronx residents enrolled in high school attended public schools.[123] 
Many public high schools are located in the borough including the elite 
Bronx High School of Science, Celia Cruz Bronx High School of Music, DeWitt 
Clinton High School, High School for Violin and Dance, Bronx Leadership 
Academy 2, Bronx International High School, the School for Excellence, 
the Morris Academy for Collaborative Study, Wings Academy for young adults, 
The Bronx School for Law, Government and Justice, Validus Preparatory Academy, 
The Eagle Academy For Young Men, Bronx Expeditionary Learning High School, 
Bronx Academy of Letters, Herbert H. Lehman High School and High School 
of American Studies. The Bronx is also home to three of New York City's 
most prestigious private, secular schools: Fieldston, Horace Mann, and 
Riverdale Country School. High schools linked to the Roman Catholic Church 
include: Saint Raymond's Academy for Girls, All Hallows High School, Fordham 
Preparatory School, Monsignor Scanlan High School, St. Raymond High School 
for Boys, Cardinal Hayes High School, Cardinal Spellman High School, The 
Academy of Mount Saint Ursula, Aquinas High School, Preston High School, 
St. Catharine Academy, Mount Saint Michael Academy, and St. Barnabas High 
School. The SAR Academy and SAR High School are Modern Orthodox Jewish 
Yeshiva coeducational day schools in Riverdale, with roots in Manhattan's 
Lower East Side. In the 1990s, New York City began closing the large, public 
high schools in the Bronx and replacing them with small high schools. Among 
the reasons cited for the changes were poor graduation rates and concerns 
about safety. Schools that have been closed or reduced in size include 
John F. Kennedy, James Monroe, Taft, Theodore Roosevelt, Adlai Stevenson, 
Evander Childs, Christopher Columbus, Morris, Walton, and South Bronx High 
Schools. More recently the City has started phasing out large middle schools, 
also replacing them with smaller schools. In 2000, 49,442 (57.5%) of the 
86,014 Bronx residents seeking college, graduate or professional degrees 
attended public institutions.[123] Several colleges and universities are 
located in the Bronx. Fordham University was founded as St. John's College 
in 1841 by the Diocese of New York as the first Catholic institution of 
higher education in the northeast. It is now officially an independent 
institution, but strongly embraces its Jesuit heritage. The 85-acre (340,000 m2) 
Bronx campus, known as Rose Hill, is the main campus of the university, 
and is among the largest within the city (other Fordham campuses are located 
in Manhattan and Westchester County).[84] Three campuses of the City University 
of New York are in the Bronx: Hostos Community College, Bronx Community 
College (occupying the former University Heights Campus of New York University)[126] 
and Herbert H. Lehman College (formerly the uptown campus of Hunter College), 
which offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees. The College of Mount 
Saint Vincent is a Catholic liberal arts college in Riverdale under the 
direction of the Sisters of Charity of New York. Founded in 1847 as a school 
for girls, the academy became a degree-granting college in 1911 and began 
admitting men in 1974. The school serves 1,600 students. Its campus is 
also home to the Academy for Jewish Religion, a transdenominational rabbinical 
and cantorial school. Manhattan College is a Catholic college in Riverdale 
which offers undergraduate programs in the arts, business, education, engineering, 
and science. It also offers graduate programs in education and engineering. 
Albert Einstein College of Medicine, part of the Montefiore Medical Center, 
is in Morris Park. Two colleges based in Westchester County have Bronx 
campuses. The Catholic and nearly all-female College of New Rochelle maintains 
satellite campuses at Co-op City and in The Hub. The coeducational and 
non-sectarian Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, founded by the Catholic Sisters 
of Mercy in 1950, has a campus near Westchester Square. By contrast, the 
private, proprietary Monroe College, focused on preparation for business 
and the professions, started in the Bronx in 1933 but now has a campus 
in New Rochelle (Westchester County) as well the Bronx's Fordham neighborhood.[127] 
The State University of New York Maritime College in Fort Schuyler (Throggs 
Neck)—at the far southeastern tip of the Bronx—is the national leader in 
maritime education and houses the Maritime Industry Museum. (Directly across 
Long Island Sound is Kings Point, Long Island, home of the United States 
Merchant Marine Academy and the American Merchant Marine Museum.) Author 
Edgar Allan Poe spent the last years of his life (1846 to 1849) in the 
Bronx at Poe Cottage, now located at Kingsbridge Road and the Grand Concourse. 
A small wooden farmhouse built around 1812, the cottage once commanded 
unobstructed vistas over the rolling Bronx hills to the shores of Long 
Island.[129] Poe moved there to get away from the Manhattan city air and 
crowding in hope that the then rural area would be beneficial for his wife's 
tuberculosis. It was in the Bronx that Poe wrote one of his most famous 
works, Annabel Lee.[130] More than a century later, the Bronx would evolve 
from a hot bed of Latin jazz to an incubator of hip hop as documented in 
the award-winning documentary, produced by City Lore and broadcast on PBS 
in 2006, "From Mambo to Hip Hop: A South Bronx Tale."[131] Hip Hop first 
emerged in the South Bronx in the early 1970s. The New York Times has identified 
1520 Sedgwick Avenue "an otherwise unremarkable high-rise just north of 
the Cross Bronx Expressway and hard along the Major Deegan Expressway" 
as a starting point, where DJ Kool Herc presided over parties in the community 
room.[132][133] The 2016 Netflix series The Get Down is based on the development 
of hip hop in 1977 in the South Bronx.[134] Ten years earlier, the Bronx 
Opera had been founded. On August 11, 1973, DJ Kool Herc was a D.J. and 
M.C. at a party in the recreation room of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue in the Bronx 
adjacent to the Cross Bronx Expressway.[135] While it was not the actual 
"Birthplace of Hip Hop" – the genre developed slowly in several places 
in the 1970s – it was verified to be the place where one of the pivotal 
and formative events occurred.[135] Specifically: [Cool Herc] extended 
an instrumental beat (mixing or scratching) to let people dance longer 
(B-boying) and began MC'ing (rapping) during the extended breakdancing. 
... [This] helped lay the foundation for a cultural revolution. Beginning 
with the advent of beat match DJing, in which Bronx DJs (Disc Jockeys) 
including Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa and DJ Kool Herc extended 
the breaks of funk records, a major new musical genre emerged that sought 
to isolate the percussion breaks of hit funk, disco and soul songs. As 
hip hop's popularity grew, performers began speaking ("rapping") in sync 
with the beats, and became known as MCs or emcees. The Herculoids, made 
up of Herc, Coke La Rock, and DJ Clark Kent, were the earliest to gain 
major fame. The Bronx is referred to in hip-hop slang as "The Boogie Down 
Bronx", or just "The Boogie Down". This was hip-hop pioneer KRS-One's inspiration 
for his thought provoking group BDP, or Boogie Down Productions, which 
included DJ Scott La Rock. Newer hip hop artists from the Bronx include 
Big Pun, Lord Toriq and Peter Gunz, Camp Lo, Swizz Beatz, Drag-On, Fat 
Joe, Terror Squad and Corey Gunz.[136] Hush Hip Hop Tours, a tour company 
founded in 2002 by local licensed sightseeing tour guide Debra Harris,[137] 
has established a sightseeing tour of the Bronx showcasing the locations 
that helped shape hip hop culture, and features some of the pioneers of 
hip hop as tour guides. The Bronx's recognition as an important center 
of African-American culture has led Fordham University to establish the 
Bronx African-American History Project (BAAHP).[138] The Bronx is the home 
of the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball. The original Yankee Stadium 
opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue, a year that saw the Yankees 
bring home their first of 27 World Series Championships. With the famous 
facade, the short right field porch and Monument Park, Yankee Stadium has 
been home to many of baseball's greatest players including Babe Ruth, Lou 
Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Whitey Ford, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Reggie Jackson, 
Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera. The original stadium was the scene of Lou 
Gehrig's Farewell Speech in 1939, Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 
World Series, Roger Maris' record breaking 61st home run in 1961, and Reggie 
Jackson's 3 home runs to clinch Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. The Stadium 
was the former home of the New York Giants of the National Football League 
from 1956 to 1973. The original Yankee Stadium closed in 2008 to make way 
for a new Yankee Stadium in which the team started play in 2009; it's north-northeast 
of the 1923 Yankee Stadium, on the former site of Macombs Dam Park. The 
current Yankee Stadium is also the home of New York City FC of Major League 
Soccer, who began play in 2015. The Bronx is home to several Off-Off-Broadway 
theaters, many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America 
and Africa. The Pregones Theater, which produces Latin American work, opened 
a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx. Some 
artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area, 
and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002. However 
rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city 
and the entire metro area. The Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, founded 
in 1998 by Arthur Aviles and Charles Rice-Gonzales, provides dance, theatre 
and art workshops, festivals and performances focusing on contemporary 
and modern art in relation to race, gender, and sexuality. It is home to 
the Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre, a contemporary dance company, and the 
Bronx Dance Coalition. The Academy was formerly in the American Bank Note 
Company Building before relocating to a venue on the grounds of St. Peter's 
Episcopal Church.[139] The Bronx Museum of the Arts, founded in 1971, exhibits 
20th century and contemporary art through its central museum space and 
11,000 square feet (1,000 m2) of galleries. Many of its exhibitions are 
on themes of special interest to the Bronx. Its permanent collection features 
more than 800 works of art, primarily by artists from Africa, Asia and 
Latin America, including paintings, photographs, prints, drawings, and 
mixed media. The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent 
a major expansion designed by the architectural firm Arquitectonica. The 
Bronx has also become home to a peculiar poetic tribute in the form of 
the "Heinrich Heine Memorial," better known as the Lorelei Fountain. After 
Heine's German birthplace of Düsseldorf had rejected, allegedly for anti-Semitic 
motives, a centennial monument to the radical German-Jewish poet (1797–1856), 
his incensed German-American admirers, including Carl Schurz, started a 
movement to place one instead in Midtown Manhattan, at Fifth Avenue and 
59th Street. However, this intention was thwarted by a combination of ethnic 
antagonism, aesthetic controversy and political struggles over the institutional 
control of public art.[140] In 1899, the memorial by Ernst Gustav Herter 
was placed in Joyce Kilmer Park, near the Yankee Stadium. In 1999, it was 
moved to 161st Street and the Concourse. The peninsular borough's maritime 
heritage is acknowledged in several ways.The City Island Historical Society 
and Nautical Museum occupies a former public school designed by the New 
York City school system's turn-of-the-last-century master architect C. 
B. J. Snyder. The state's Maritime College in Fort Schuyler (on the southeastern 
shore) houses the Maritime Industry Museum.[141] In addition, the Harlem 
River is reemerging as "Scullers' Row"[142] due in large part to the efforts 
of the Bronx River Restoration Project,[143] a joint public-private endeavor 
of the city's parks department. Canoeing and kayaking on the borough's 
namesake river have been promoted by the Bronx River Alliance. The river 
is also straddled by the New York Botanical Gardens, its neighbor, the 
Bronx Zoo, and a little further south, on the west shore, Bronx River Art 
Center.[144] The Bronx has several local newspapers, including The Bronx 
News,[145] Parkchester News, City News, The Riverdale Press, Riverdale 
Review, The Bronx Times Reporter, Inner City Press [146] (which now has 
more of a focus on national issues) and Co-Op City Times. Four non-profit 
news outlets, Norwood News, Mount Hope Monitor, Mott Haven Herald and The 
Hunts Point Express serve the borough's poorer communities. The editor 
and co-publisher of The Riverdale Press, Bernard Stein, won the Pulitzer 
Prize for Editorial Writing for his editorials about Bronx and New York 
City issues in 1998. (Stein graduated from the Bronx High School of Science 
in 1959.) The Bronx once had its own daily newspaper, The Bronx Home News, 
which started publishing on January 20, 1907, and merged into the New York 
Post in 1948. It became a special section of the Post, sold only in the 
Bronx, and eventually disappeared from view. One of New York City's major 
non-commercial radio broadcasters is WFUV, a National Public Radio-affiliated 
50,000-watt station broadcasting from Fordham University's Rose Hill campus 
in the Bronx. The radio station's antenna is atop an apartment building 
owned by Montefiore Medical Center. The City of New York has an official 
television station run by the NYC Media Group and broadcasting from Bronx 
Community College, and Cablevision operates News 12 The Bronx, both of 
which feature programming based in the Bronx. Co-op City was the first 
area in the Bronx, and the first in New York beyond Manhattan, to have 
its own cable television provider. The local public-access television station 
BronxNet originates from Herbert H. Lehman College, the borough's only 
four year CUNY school, and provides government-access television (GATV) 
public affairs programming in addition to programming produced by Bronx 
residents.[147] Mid-20th century movies set in the Bronx portrayed densely 
settled, working-class, urban culture. Hollywood films such as From This 
Day Forward (1946), set in Highbridge, occasionally delved into Bronx life. 
Paddy Chayefsky's Academy Award-winning Marty was the most notable examination 
of working class Bronx life[148] was also explored by Chayefsky in his 
1956 film The Catered Affair, and in the 1993 Robert De Niro/Chazz Palminteri 
film, A Bronx Tale, Spike Lee's 1999 movie Summer of Sam, centered in an 
Italian-American Bronx community, 1994's I Like It Like That that takes 
place in the predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood of the South Bronx, 
and Doughboys, the story of two Italian-American brothers in danger of 
losing their bakery thanks to one brother's gambling debts. The Bronx's 
gritty urban life had worked its way into the movies even earlier, with 
depictions of the "Bronx cheer", a loud flatulent-like sound of disapproval, 
allegedly first made by New York Yankees fans. The sound can be heard, 
for example, when Spike Jones sings "Der Fuehrer's Face" (from the 1942 
Disney animated film of the same name), repeatedly lambasting Adolf Hitler 
with: "We'll Heil! (Bronx cheer) Heil! (Bronx cheer) Right in Der Fuehrer's 
Face!"[149] Some movies have also used the term Bronx for comic effect, 
such as "Bronx", the character on the Disney animated series Gargoyles. 
Starting in the 1970s, the Bronx often symbolized violence, decay, and 
urban ruin. The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s 
inspired the observation that "The Bronx is burning": in 1974 it was the 
title of both a New York Times editorial and a BBC documentary film. The 
line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the 1977 World Series, 
when a fire broke out near Yankee Stadium as the team was playing the Los 
Angeles Dodgers. Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx 
prior to this fire. As the fire was captured on live television, announcer 
Howard Cosell is wrongly remembered to have said something like, "There 
it is, ladies and gentlemen: the Bronx is burning". Historians of New York 
City frequently point to Cosell's remark as an acknowledgement of both 
the city and the borough's decline.[150] A new feature-length documentary 
film by Edwin Pagan called Bronx Burning[151] is in production[152] in 
2006, chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud 
fires of the 1970s in the borough. Bronx gang life was depicted in the 
1974 novel The Wanderers by Bronx native Richard Price and the 1979 movie 
of the same name. They are set in the heart of the Bronx, showing apartment 
life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor. In the 1979 film The 
Warriors, the eponymous gang go to a meeting in Van Cortlandt Park in the 
Bronx, and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to Coney 
Island in Brooklyn. A Bronx Tale (1993) depicts gang activities in the 
Belmont "Little Italy" section of the Bronx. The 2005 video game adaptation 
features levels called Pelham, Tremont, and "Gunhill" (a play off the name 
Gun Hill Road). This theme lends itself to the title of The Bronx Is Burning, 
an eight-part ESPN TV mini-series (2007) about the New York Yankees' drive 
to winning baseball's 1977 World Series. The TV series emphasizes the boisterous 
nature of the team, led by manager Billy Martin, catcher Thurman Munson 
and outfielder Reggie Jackson, as well as the malaise of the Bronx and 
New York City in general during that time, such as the blackout, the city's 
serious financial woes and near bankruptcy, the arson for insurance payments, 
and the election of Ed Koch as mayor. The 1981 film Fort Apache, The Bronx 
is another film that used the Bronx's gritty image for its storyline. The 
movie's title is from the nickname for the 41st Police Precinct in the 
South Bronx which was nicknamed "Fort Apache". Also from 1981 is the horror 
film Wolfen making use of the rubble of the Bronx as a home for werewolf 
type creatures. Knights of the South Bronx, a true story of a teacher who 
worked with disadvantaged children, is another film also set in the Bronx 
released in 2005. The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film Fuga dal 
Bronx, also known as Bronx Warriors 2 and Escape 2000, an Italian B-movie 
best known for its appearance on the television series Mystery Science 
Theatre 3000. The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation's 
plans to depopulate, destroy and redevelop the Bronx, and a band of rebels 
who are out to expose the corporation's murderous ways and save their homes. 
The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase, "Leave 
the Bronx!" Many of the movie's scenes were filmed in Queens, substituting 
as the Bronx. Rumble in the Bronx was a 1995 Jackie Chan kung-fu film, 
another which popularised the Bronx to international audiences. Last Bronx, 
a 1996 Sega game played on the bad reputation of the Bronx to lend its 
name to an alternate version of post-Japanese bubble Tokyo, where crime 
and gang warfare is rampant. Bronx native Nancy Savoca's 1989 comedy, True 
Love, explores two Italian-American Bronx sweethearts in the days before 
their wedding. The film, which debuted Annabella Sciorra and Ron Eldard 
as the betrothed couple, won the Grand Jury Prize at that year's Sundance 
Film Festival. The CBS television sitcom Becker, 1998–2004, was more ambiguous. 
The show starred Ted Danson as Dr. John Becker, a doctor who operated a 
small practice and was constantly annoyed by his patients, co-workers, 
friends, and practically everything and everybody else in his world. It 
showed his everyday life as a doctor working in a small clinic in the Bronx. 
Penny Marshall's 1990 film Awakenings, which was nominated for several 
Oscars, is based on neurologist Oliver Sacks' 1973 account of his psychiatric 
patients at Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx who were paralyzed by a 
form of encephalitis but briefly responded to the drug L-dopa. Robin Williams 
played the physician; Robert De Niro was one of the patients who emerged 
from a catatonic (frozen) state. The home of Williams' character was shot 
not far from Sacks' actual City Island residence. A 1973 Yorkshire Television 
documentary and "A Kind of Alaska", a 1985 play by Harold Pinter,[153] 
were also based on Sacks' book. Gus Van Sant's 2000 Finding Forrester was 
quickly billed "Good Will Hunting in the Hood." Sean Connery is in the 
title role of a reclusive old man who 50 years earlier wrote a single novel 
that garnered the Pulitzer Prize. He meets 16-year-old Jamal, porytayed 
by Rob Brown, a gifted basketball player and aspiring writer from the Bronx, 
and becomes his mentor. The movie includes stock footage of Bronx housing 
projects from 1990, as well as some other scenes shot in Manhattan and 
Brooklyn. The 2012 documentary "South Bronx United" features the Mott Haven 
neighborhood and its conflict over the online grocery delivery service 
Fresh Direct's move of their trucking facility from Long Island City to 
the South Bronx. The Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature. 
All of the characters in Herman Wouk's City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie 
Bookbinder (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set 
there. Kate Simon's Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood is directly 
autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant 
family growing up before World War II, and living near Arthur Avenue and 
Tremont Avenue.[154] In Jacob M. Appel's short story, "The Grand Concourse" 
(2007),[155] a woman who grew up in the iconic Lewis Morris Building returns 
to the Morrisania neighborhood with her adult daughter. Similarly, in Avery 
Corman's book The Old Neighborhood (1980),[156] an upper-middle class white 
protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood (Fordham Road and the Grand 
Concourse), and learns that even though the folks are poor, Hispanic and 
African-American, they are good people. By contrast, Tom Wolfe's Bonfire 
of the Vanities (1987)[157] portrays a wealthy, white protagonist, Sherman 
McCoy, getting lost off the Major Deegan Expressway in the South Bronx 
and having an altercation with locals. A substantial piece of the last 
part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County 
Courthouse. However, times change, and in 2007, the New York Times reported 
that "the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman's accident are now 
dotted with townhouses and apartments." In the same article, the Reverend 
Al Sharpton (whose fictional analogue in the novel is "Reverend Bacon") 
asserts that "twenty years later, the cynicism of The Bonfire of the Vanities 
is as out of style as Tom Wolfe's wardrobe."[158] Don DeLillo's Underworld 
(1997) is also set in the Bronx and offers a perspective on the decline 
of the area from the 1950s onwards. John Patrick Shanley's "Savage in Limbo" 
is set in a 1980s Bronx bar called 'Scales' where the frustrated characters 
feel they are unable to move. In poetry, the Bronx has been immortalized 
by one of the world's shortest couplets: The Bronx No Thonx Ogden Nash, 
The New Yorker, 1931 Nash repented 33 years after his calumny, penning 
in 1964 the following prose poem to the Dean of Bronx Community College: 
I can't seem to escape the sins of my smart-alec youth; Here are my amends. 
I wrote those lines, "The Bronx? No thonx"; I shudder to confess them. 
Now I'm an older, wiser man I cry, "The Bronx? God bless them!"[66] Bronx 
Memoir Project: Vol. 1 is a published anthology by the Bronx Council of 
the Arts and brought forth through a series of workshops meant to empower 
Bronx residents and shed the stigma on the Bronx's burning past.[159] The 
Bronx Memoir Project was created as an ongoing collaboration between the 
Bronx Council on the Arts and other cultural institutions, including The 
Bronx Documentary Center, The Bronx Library Center, Poe Park Visitor Center, 
Mindbuilders, and other institutions and funded through a grant from the 
National Endowment for the Arts.[160][161] The goal was to develop and 
refine memoir fragments written by people of all walks of life that share 
a common bond residing within the Bronx.[160] However, the following songs 
also mention the Bronx (see also list of songs about New York City): General:
