Dark blue, silver           The Hartford Dark Blues were a 19th-century 
baseball team. The team was based in Hartford, Connecticut. The Hartford 
Dark Blues were a member of the National Association of Professional Base 
Ball Players in 1874 and 1875 and the National League in 1876 and 1877. 
In 1877 the team played in Brooklyn, New York as the Brooklyn Hartfords. 
Playing at the Hartford Ball Club Grounds, in 1876 they joined the National 
League as a charter member. The team's owner, Morgan G. Bulkeley, was also 
the first president of the National League. Managed by their third baseman, 
Bob Ferguson, the Dark Blues went on to finish third in 1876 with a record 
of 47–21. The team's strong suit was pitching, with both Tommy Bond and 
future Hall of Famer Candy Cummings finishing with an earned run average 
under 2. The pitching staff recorded the most complete games (69) and allowed 
the lowest number of home runs throughout the 70-game 1876 campaign (the 
Philadelphia Athletics also accomplished this feat that season). The team's 
best hitter was right fielder Dick Higham, who led the team in most offensive 
categories. The team left Hartford and moved to Brooklyn, New York for 
the 1877 season to become the Brooklyn Hartfords. Managed again by Ferguson, 
the team finished in third again, with a record of 31–27. With Bond, Cummings 
and Higham all having left the team, the team's best player this year was 
undoubtedly right fielder John Cassidy, who batted .378 and also led the 
team in many other categories. The team disbanded after the 1877 season.
