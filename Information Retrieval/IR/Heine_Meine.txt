Henry William "Heine" Meine (May 1, 1896 – March 18, 1968), sometimes "Heinie" 
Meine, was a professional baseball player. Meine was a right-handed pitcher 
who played for the St. Louis Browns in 1922 and for the Pittsburgh Pirates 
from 1929 to 1934. He was given the nickname "The Count of Luxemburg" on 
account of his operating a speakeasy/tavern in the Luxemburg section of 
St. Louis. He led the National League in wins and innings pitched in 1931 
and compiled a 66–50 record in seven seasons of Major League Baseball. 
Born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Meine served in the United States 
Army during World War I.[1] After a tip that Meine, who was playing semipro 
ball in 1920, threw "a good spitball", he was signed to play professional 
baseball for Beaumont in the Texas League. Meine made his professional 
baseball debut in 1921 at age 25. He entered professional baseball the 
same year that the spitball, Meine's mainstay, was outlawed. Interviewed 
in 1963, Meine recalled: "After the Carl Mays–Ray Chapman accident in 1920, 
baseball outlawed all freak pitches and trick deliveries. I had one break. 
Either the news was slow in reaching Texas or they didn't care what the 
rest of the world did. The spitball was still a legal pitch in the Texas 
League in 1921. I could use it, but I knew if I wanted to go to the majors 
I'd have to change over completely."[2] In the years that followed, Meine 
was forced to develop new pitches. He became a control pitcher who did 
not pitch with great velocity, but could hit his spots.[2] Some referred 
to him as a "junk man" or a "junkballer."[2][3] In 1922, Meine was sold 
to the St. Louis Browns but he appeared in only one game for the club, 
pitching four innings in relief.[4] After the 1922 season, Meine spent 
three years in the minor leagues, pitching for the Syracuse Stars and Kansas 
City Blues. In 1926, he compiled a 17–14 record with a 3.27 ERA.[5] Despite 
the 17-win season, Meine quit baseball after the 1926 season. He recalled, 
"It didn't look like I was going up, and I just retired. I had other income 
and didn't have to play baseball."[2] Meine owned a speakeasy in the St. 
Louis area. Sportswriter Red Smith recalled spending a few hours there 
as a young reporter and later wrote: "Heinie's store was genteel in a knock-down-drag-out 
way, and the specialty of the house in those prohibition days was a brand 
of Moose Milk that would peel the paint off a battleship."[6] He was known 
through his career "The Count of Luxemburg,"[2][4] because he lived and 
operated his tavern in the unincorporated area south of St. Louis that 
was known as Luxemburg.[7][8] When Pittsburgh outfielder Paul Waner showed 
up smelling of liquor and with eyes squinting for a 1932 game at Sportsman's 
Park in St Louis, the Cardinals' manager asked if Waner had a rough night. 
Waner replied, "Rough night? What a host that Meine is."[8] In 1930, with 
Prohibition still in effect, one newspaper account reported that Meine 
owned "a soft drink parlor" in St. Louis.[9] St. Louis sportswriter Bob 
Broeg noted that Meine's tavern was known for its "gemütlichkeit."[8] Meine 
later recalled that the patrons at his drinking establishment motivated 
him to return to baseball: "In 1928, some of the boys in the tavern kept 
riding me, saying that I could win in semipro ball and in the minors, but 
never in the majors. So I rejoined Kansas City for part of the season and 
was up with Pittsburgh in '29."[1] Meine compiled a 7–4 record for the 
Kansas City Blues in 1928.[5] In 1929, he signed with the Pirates at age 
33. He appeared in 22 games, 13 as a starter, for the 1929 Pirates, compiling 
a 7–6 record.[4] A throat condition limited Meine's playing time during 
the 1930 season. He had been scheduled to pitch the season opener, but 
was unable to play due to an attack of tonsilitis. He didn't appear in 
a game for the Pirates until May 5, when he gave up three runs in relief 
against the New York Giants.[10] He left the team in mid-August due to 
illness,[11] and was "placed on the voluntary retired list."[12] In December 
1930, it was determined that his tonsils had caused his illness, and he 
had them removed. Having been placed on the retired list, Meine was required 
to apply to Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis seeking reinstatement.[12] 
A total of 12 Pirates players, including future Hall of Famers Pie Traynor, 
Paul Waner, and Lloyd Waner, also had their tonsils removed. An Associated 
Press story in January 1931 noted: "The Pittsburgh Pirates think the reason 
they didn't finish higher in the National League race last season was because 
their tonsils were not so good. And if they're right, the boys point out, 
they should be one of the healthiest teams in the land this year."[13] 
Returning to baseball sans tonsils, Meine had the best year of his career 
in 1931. Having never won more than seven games in a season for the Pirates, 
Meine compiled a 19–13 record for the 1931 Pirates.[4] In his first two 
games against the 1931 St. Louis Cardinals, he pitched shutouts against 
the group that went on to win 101 games and the 1931 World Series.[14] 
He won his 19th game on September 23, 1931, pitching 13 innings in a 3–2 
win over the Phillies.[15] His 1931 performance led the National League 
in wins (19), innings pitched (284), and batters faced (1,202), and ranked 
fourth in earned run average (2.98).[4] After the 1931 season, Meine participated 
in an exhibition game at St. Louis between Max Carey's All-Stars (an all-star 
team of major leaguers) and the St. Louis Stars of the Negro Leagues. Meine 
gave up 10 runs as the Stars won 10–8.[16] The game may have inspired Kevin 
King's 2007 fictional account of a Negro League team defeating a team of 
major league all-stars. In King's account, Negro League star Mule Suttles 
tries to recall the list of major league all-stars who played in the game: 
"Heinie Manush, Heinie Meine, Heinie Schuble. They had Heinies coming out 
of the hiney, and we kicked their hineys."[17] In 1932, Meine was a holdout, 
refusing to accept the contract terms offered by the Pirates and declining 
to report to spring training in Paso Robles, California with the rest of 
the team.[18] Meine's holdout continued into May, making him the last player 
continuing to hold out for better contract terms.[19][20] On May 16, 1932, 
The Pittsburgh Press referred to Meine as the "obstinate Pittsburgh holdout" 
and reported that the Pirates were trying to strike a deal to send Meine 
to the Brooklyn Dodgers.[21][22] Meine ultimately reached terms with the 
Pirates in late May. After his holdout, Grantland Rice reported that Meine 
was being paid $11,500 for the year. Rice wrote a column praising Meine: 
"Meine was the hardest working pitcher in the National League last season. 
He hurled 22 complete games, worked 284 innings, won 19 games against 13 
lost, and yielded an earned run average of 2.98. And all of this he did 
with a fifth place club."[23] When he led the Pirates to a 2–1 victory 
over Brooklyn in June 1932, The New York Times opened its game coverage 
as follows: "Heine Meine came to Ebbets Field with the Pirates yesterday 
and gave 18,000 fans an exhibition of his very best pitching by holding 
the Carey clan to five hits in seven innings."[24] Meine compiled a 12–9 
record and a 3.86 ERA in 1932.[4] When Meine signed his 1933 contract with 
the Pirates in January, the Associated Press noted that "such well-known 
exponents of the art of arguing over salary matters as Floyd Caves Herman 
and Heinie Meine, meekly came to terms."[25] The New York Times referred 
to Meine as the "ace of the Pirates' pitching staff" and reported that 
his contract was for five figures and was for one year.[26] He opened the 
season with a record of 5–0 to lead the National League in late May.[27] 
When the Pirates honored Honus Wagner with a tribute day in May 1933, Meine 
pitched a 2–1 victory over the Brooklyn Dodgers.[28] After a mid-season 
slump, Meine began to turn things around in late July. After pitching three 
shutout innings in relief to help the Pirates come from behind against 
the Giants, The Pittsburgh Press reported: "Just when all hope was being 
lost for him, Heinie Meine came back yesterday to confound the critics 
with a brilliant bit of relief pitching. The Duke of Luxemborg throttled 
the Giants ..."[29] Meine finished the 1933 season with a 15–8 record and 
a 3.65 ERA,[4] helping lead the Pirates to an 87–67 record and a second-place 
finish in the National League.[30] Meine returned to the Pirates in 1934 
for his final year in Major League Baseball. He was the Pirates' starter 
in the season opener, but allowed seven runs in a 7–1 loss to the Cardinals 
at St. Louis.[31] Used increasingly in relief, Meine appeared in 26 games, 
14 as a starter. He compiled a 7–6 record and a 4.32 ERA.[4] When Meine 
pitched a complete game, 4–1 victory over the Cubs in August 1934, the 
Chicago Daily Tribune reported: "Heinie Meine, a wobbly old timer who had 
pitched only one complete game this year, this afternoon felt no aches 
and pains in standing the Cubs on their heads for nine innings."[32] His 
final major league appearance came in a 9–4 loss to the Dodgers on September 
18, 1934 at Ebbets Field. Meine pitched one-third of an inning in relief 
and gave up four earned runs.[33] For his career, he compiled a 66–50 record 
in 165 appearances, with a 3.95 ERA and 199 strikeouts.[4] Meine was married 
to Grace Bonds in November 1921. Their son, Howard Meine, pitched in St. 
Louis municipal baseball for several years.[34] After retiring from baseball, 
Meine returned to his tavern business. He also operated a baseball school 
at 153 Lemay Ferry Road south of St. Louis. He constructed a building with 
locker facilities for 50 to 60 boys.[35][36] He hired former major league 
players, including Marty McManus, Vern Stephens, Phil Todt, and Monty Stratton, 
to work at the school and advertised his courses in The Sporting News.[37] 
Meine also helped develop the Lemay Baseball Association in St. Louis, 
building a field next to his tavern and maintaining it himself.[1][34] 
Heine Meine Field, built by Meine, remains in use a baseball field.[38][39] 
Meine's hobbies in his later years included hunting, fishing and bowling.[34] 
In March 1968, Meine died of cancer at the Alexian Brothers Hospital in
