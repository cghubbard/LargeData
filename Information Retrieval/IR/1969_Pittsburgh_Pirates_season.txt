The 1969 Pittsburgh Pirates season was a season in American baseball. It 
consisted of the Pirates finishing in third place in the newly established 
National League East, twelve games behind the eventual World Series champion 
New York Mets. The Pirates were managed by Larry Shepard, and played their 
home games at Forbes Field, which was in its final full season of operation, 
before moving into their new facility in the middle of the following season.
