airport, Robertson Field. Plainville has three elementary schools: Louis 
Toffolon School, Frank T. Wheeler School, and Linden Street School. There 
is one middle school, the Middle School of Plainville, which serves grades 
6-8. The middle school adopts the same mascot and colors as the town high 
school. Plainville High School is the only town high school. The school 
mascot is the Blue Devil, and the colors are blue and white, same as nearby 
Central Connecticut State University. The baseball team has a rich tradition, 
with another state title won in 2012. Plainville holds an annual Hot Air 
Balloon Festival at the end of August at Norton Park, gathering many of 
the townspeople together for fun-filled nights of games, music, and fireworks. 
The event is sponsored by the Plainville Fire Company. However, wanting 
to improve the soccer fields with an irrigation system at Norton Park, 
the Plainville Town Council was planning to discontinue the Balloon Festival 
due to the fire trucks usually parking on the soccer fields. However this 
did not pass, and the festival continues to operate annually. Plainville 
has also been something of a minor transportation hub. In the nineteenth 
century, Plainville was served by the Farmington Canal. It also sits on 
the intersection of two rail lines, one running north from New Haven and 
the other running east-west between Waterbury and Berlin. Finally, Plainville 
is the home of Robertson Airport, the oldest private airport in Connecticut.
