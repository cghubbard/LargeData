Garret Joseph Anderson (born June 30, 1972) is a former left fielder in 
Major League Baseball who played for three teams from 1994 to 2010, all 
but the last two years with the California/Anaheim/Los Angeles Angels (appearing 
with the team under all three of its recent names). He holds Angels franchise 
records for career games played (2,013), at bats (7,989), hits (2,368), 
runs scored (1,024), runs batted in (RBI) (1,292), total bases (3,743), 
extra base hits (796), singles (1,572), doubles (489), grand slams (8), 
RBI in a single game (10) and consecutive games with an RBI (12), as well 
as home runs by a left-handed hitter (272). A three-time All-Star, he led 
the Angels to the 2002 World Series title, and was named Most Valuable 
Player of the 2003 All-Star Game. Garret Anderson attended Kennedy High 
School in Granada Hills, California. While there, he was a three-sport 
star in baseball, football, and basketball. In baseball, he won two All-Los 
Angeles City honors and two All-League Honors, and as a junior, helped 
his team win the Los Angeles City Championship. In basketball, as a senior 
he won All-Los Angeles City honors and All-League honors.[1] Anderson was 
selected by the California Angels in the fourth round of the 1990 MLB Draft 
and made his major league debut on July 27, 1994. He had two hits in four 
at bats in that game, recording his first career hit on a single to right 
field off of Oakland Athletics pitcher Ron Darling in the bottom of the 
third inning. He appeared in only five games with the Angels in 1994, getting 
five hits in 13 at bats. In 1995, he was called up to the team on April 
26 and spent the rest of the year in the majors. He hit his first career 
home run on June 13 against Kevin Tapani of the Minnesota Twins. He batted 
.321 in 106 games with 16 home runs and 69 RBIs, and finished second in 
the Rookie of the Year voting to Marty Cordova of the Twins. From that 
point forward, Anderson became a mainstay in the Angels lineup. Over the 
next eight seasons, he accumulated at least 600 at bats every year, breaking 
90 RBIs and 20 home runs five times while compiling a batting average near 
.300. While he was hitting home runs in 2000, he wasn't taking many walks. 
He became only the second player to conclude a 30-homer season with more 
homers than walks (35 HR, 24 BB), joining Ivan Rodriguez (35–24 in 1999); 
the dubious feat has since been duplicated by Alfonso Soriano (39–23 in 
2002), Javy Lopez (43–33 in 2003), José Guillén (31–24 in 2003), Joe Crede 
(30–28 in 2006) and Ryan Braun (34–29 in 2007).[2] In 2002, when the Angels 
won their first World Series championship, Garret finished fourth in the 
Most Valuable Player voting after compiling a .306 average with 29 home 
runs and 123 runs batted in. Anderson also scored a career-high 93 runs; 
however, the fact that he never scored 100 in a season was a result of 
his main weakness as a player – an inability to draw walks and achieve 
a high on-base percentage. Anderson had a similarly strong performance 
in 2003, and was named an American League All-Star. That All-Star weekend, 
he stole the show by becoming the Home Run Derby Champion and voted the 
Most Valuable Player in the All-Star Game, the first player to win both 
since Cal Ripken, Jr. in 1991.[3] On April 13, 2004, Anderson agreed to 
a $48 million, four-year contract extension through 2008. The deal included 
a team option for 2009 with a $3 million buyout.[4] Anderson began experiencing 
chronic ailments in 2004 that limited his playing time and production, 
including an arthritic condition and plantar fasciitis in his feet. In 
2005, he began to see more regular time as a designated hitter to ease 
the wear and tear on his body. Anderson's production in 2006 was roughly 
on par with his 2005 production, with both seasons seeing him hit 17 home 
runs and drive in at least 85 runs. On August 21, 2007, he drove in a team-record 
10 runs, including a grand slam and a three-run homer, in the Los Angeles 
Angels' 18–9 win over the New York Yankees. Anderson became the 13th player 
in Major League history to have 10 RBIs in a game. Anderson now holds the 
team record for grand slams with eight and RBIs in a game with ten. This 
performance has been part of a general resurgence in the second half of 
the 2007 season, a relief to Angels fans who may have wondered if Anderson's 
career was near its end after a mediocre, injury-plagued first half. Instead, 
Anderson has led the majors in RBIs in the latter part of 2007. On September 
7, Anderson drove in a run on an RBI single, to set a franchise record 
for most consecutive games with an RBI with 11. The streak lasted for 12 
games, during which time he drove in 22 runs. On October 28, 2008, the 
Angels announced they would decline their $14 million option on Anderson's 
contract and exercised a $3 million buyout.[5] On February 24, 2009, Anderson 
agreed to a one-year deal with the Atlanta Braves for $2.5 million.[6] 
On April 5, 2009, in the Braves' first game of the season, Anderson collected 
the 2,369th hit of his career, and the first he had with any franchise 
besides the Angels. On July 2, 2009, Anderson hit the first career pinch-hit 
home run of his career.[7] On October 1, 2009, Anderson became the 89th 
player to reach 2,500 base hits, getting a single off of Washington Nationals 
pitcher Garrett Mock.[8] On March 3, 2010, Anderson agreed to a minor league 
deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.[9] He made the 25-man opening day roster 
as a reserve outfielder. In his first at bat with the Dodgers, he hit a 
pinch-hit single off Brendan Donnelly, his former Angels teammate. His 
first home run with the Dodgers came on April 22, when he hit a pinch-hit 
2-run homer against the Cincinnati Reds. Anderson was designated for assignment 
August 8, 2010[10] after hitting only .181 in 155 at bats, and was granted 
his release on August 10. On March 1, 2011, Anderson announced his retirement 
in a statement issued by the Angels.[11] As of 2012, Anderson is an Angels 
pregame and postgame reporter during home games and some road games on 
Fox Sports West, along with former teammate Tim Salmon. He appeared on 
the ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum 2016 election 
and earned one vote.[12] In 2016, Anderson was inducted into the Angels'
