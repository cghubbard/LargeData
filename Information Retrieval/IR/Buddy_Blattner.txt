Robert Garnett Blattner (February 8, 1920 – September 4, 2009), commonly 
known as "Buddy" or "Bud" Blattner, was an American table tennis and baseball 
player and radio and television sportscaster. A graduate of Beaumont High 
School in St. Louis, Blattner played table tennis in his youth, winning 
the world men's doubles championship in 1936.[1] He started his baseball 
career with the St. Louis Cardinals, making his big-league debut in the 
1942 season. Following a stint in the U.S. Navy, Blattner played for the 
New York Giants (1946–48) and Philadelphia Phillies (1949), playing primarily 
at second base. Blattner turned to broadcasting after his retirement as 
a player, teaming with Dizzy Dean on St. Louis Browns radio as well as 
nationally on the Liberty and Mutual networks, and on the televised baseball 
Game of the Week on ABC (1953–54) and CBS (1955–59). Blattner was replaced 
on CBS by Pee Wee Reese following a dispute with Dean. He continued to 
broadcast baseball for the Cardinals (1960–61), Los Angeles/California 
Angels (1962–68), and Kansas City Royals (1969–75) as well as on NBC in 
1969. He also called games for the St. Louis Hawks of the National Basketball 
Association in the '50s. In 1962, Blattner founded the "Buddy Fund", a 
charitable organization that supplies athletic equipment to disabled and 
underprivileged children in the St. Louis area.[2] Blattner was inducted 
into the U.S. Table Tennis Association Hall of Fame in 1979, and the Missouri 
Sports Hall of Fame in 1980.[3] Blattner died at his home in Chesterfield,
