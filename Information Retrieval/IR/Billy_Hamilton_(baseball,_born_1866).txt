William Robert "Sliding Billy" Hamilton (February 16, 1866 – December 16, 
1940) was a 19th-century Major League Baseball (MLB) player who holds a 
number of baseball records. He played for the Kansas City Cowboys, Philadelphia 
Phillies and Boston Beaneaters between 1888 and 1901. He was elected to 
the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 1961. As of 2016, he is 
third on the all-time list of career stolen bases leaders. Hamilton was 
born on February 16, 1866[1] in Newark, New Jersey. His parents, Samuel 
and Mary Hamilton, had immigrated to New Jersey from Ireland. Biographer 
Roy Kerr writes that evidence suggests that Hamilton was descended from 
the Ulster Scots people. (As an adult, Hamilton was known to proudly proclaim 
his Scottish ancestry.) When Hamilton was a small child, his family moved 
to Clinton, Massachusetts.[2] He worked in a Clinton cotton mill as a young 
teenager.[3] Hamilton broke into the major leagues in the American Association 
with the Kansas City Cowboys in 1888. He established himself as a star 
the following season by batting .301 with 144 runs and 111 stolen bases. 
In 1890, the Cowboys, who were ceasing operations, sold Hamilton to the 
Philadelphia Phillies. The next year he led the NL in batting average (.340), 
runs scored (141) and hits (179). For a third consecutive season, Hamilton 
led the NL in stolen bases. In 1892, Hamilton hit both a leadoff and game-ending 
home run in the same game. Only Vic Power (1957), Darin Erstad (2000), 
Reed Johnson (2003) and Ian Kinsler (2009) have accomplished the same feat.[4] 
He hit .380 in 1893, which led the major leagues. Philadelphia outfielders 
Hamilton, Sam Thompson, Ed Delahanty and Tuck Turner all hit over .400 
in 1894. That year Hamilton set the all-time standard for most runs scored 
in a season (198); since then, Babe Ruth has come closest to Hamilton in 
runs scored, with 177 in 1921, setting the American League and modern MLB 
record. Hamilton also set the record for most stolen bases in one game, 
with seven on August 31, 1894. He set the record for most consecutive games 
scoring one or more runs, with 35 runs in 24 games in July–August 1894.[5] 
Hamilton led the league in steals for a fifth time in 1895. In 1896, Hamilton 
moved to Boston, for whom he played his final six seasons. Although his 
numbers declined, Hamilton still scored over 100 runs in all but two of 
those seasons. Hamilton retired after the 1901 season. Over his career 
he compiled 912 (or 937; see Career total discrepancy) stolen bases, a 
.344 batting average and 1690 runs in 1591 games; he is one of only three 
players to average more than one run per game played. His .455 career on-base 
percentage ranks fourth all-time behind Ted Williams, Babe Ruth and John 
McGraw, and his 912 stolen bases ranks third behind Rickey Henderson and 
Lou Brock. He is the Philadelphia Phillies career leader in batting average 
(.361), on-base percentage (.468) and stolen bases (508). He holds Phillies 
single-season records for on-base percentage (.523 in 1894), runs (196 
in 1894), stolen bases (111 in 1891) and times on base (355 in 1894). Though 
stolen bases were credited differently during Hamilton's career than they 
are in modern times, he was very proud of his stolen base marks. In 1937, 
Hamilton lambasted the Sporting News in a letter he wrote to them, stating, 
"I was and will be the greatest base stealer of all time. I stole over 
100 bases on many years and if they ever re-count the record I will get 
my just reward." [6] His career steals total differs, based on the source. 
Hamilton's plaque in the Baseball Hall of Fame credits him with 937 steals,[7] 
while MLB.com credits him with 912 steals[8] and Baseball Reference.com 
credits him with 914 steals.[9] After his playing days ended, Hamilton 
managed several minor league teams in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts and 
served as a scout with the Boston Nationals.[10] Hamilton was inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1961. He was the first New Jersey native 
so honored, and remains the on;y one from the northern part of the state, 
with Joe Medwick from Carteret in central New Jersey; and Goose Goslin 
was from Salem in South Jersey, Alabama-born Monte Irvin grew up in East 
Orange and South Carolina-born Larry Doby, and Troy, NY born Mike 'King' 
Kelly both grew up in Paterson. Hamilton died on December 15, 1940 at his 
home at 6 Lucian Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. He was survived by 
his wife Rebecca (Carr) Hamilton, four daughters and two grandchildren.[10]
