Gabriel Stefan "Gabe" Kapler (born July 31, 1975) is a former Major League 
Baseball outfielder. He played portions of 13 seasons with the Detroit 
Tigers, Texas Rangers, Colorado Rockies, Boston Red Sox, Milwaukee Brewers, 
and the Tampa Bay Rays. He is 6 feet 2 inches tall, and weighs 205 lbs.[1] 
Kapler is Jewish, and to honor his heritage, has a Star of David tattooed 
on his left calf, with the inscription "Strong Willed, Strong Minded" in 
Hebrew, and the post-Holocaust motto "Never Again" with a flame and the 
dates of the Holocaust on his right calf. He describes his background as 
"culturally Jewish. ... I was—and am—proud of my heritage, but don't practice 
religion."[2] Kapler has been given the nickname Hebrew Hammer[3] due to 
his frequent longball hits, along with his muscularity and the fact that 
he is Jewish. It later became the nickname of Ryan Braun, who is also Jewish, 
and was Kapler's teammate on the Brewers.[4] On September 27, 1999, the 
Tigers commemorated the closing of Tiger Stadium by wearing the numbers 
of greats from the organization's history. Kapler's jersey was blank, an 
homage to Ty Cobb, who competed before players received numbers. This was 
ironic, as Cobb was a notorious anti-Semite.[5] On August 8, 2005, while 
playing for the Red Sox, Kapler took the field in the 9th inning along 
with Kevin Youkilis and Adam Stern, setting a "record" for the most Jewish 
players on the field at one time in American League history and the most 
in Major League Baseball history since four Jews took the field for the 
New York Giants in a game in 1941.[6] In 2008, with his career 69th home 
run he passed Art Shamsky and Lou Boudreau for 9th on the all-time list 
for home runs by Jewish major leaguers.[7] Kapler was the unanimous winner 
of the 2008 Jewish Comeback Player of the Year award.[8] Through 2010, 
he was 10th all-time in career home runs among Jewish major league baseball 
players.[9] Kapler played for the Taft High School baseball team, and graduated 
in 1993. He attended Cal State-Fullerton in 1994 on scholarship, before 
transferring to 2-year Moorpark College in 1995. He was named 1st team 
All-Western Conference after hitting .337 with 7 homers and 52 RBIs. Kapler 
was inducted into the Moorpark College Athletic Hall of Fame in 2008.[10] 
Kapler is an avid weightlifter. He was on the cover of several fitness 
magazines and became renowned for being the focus of an entire K-Swiss 
shoe campaign before he had even reached the pros. Kapler was a 57th-round 
draft pick (1,487th overall) by the Detroit Tigers in 1995. In 1996 he 
led the South Atlantic League in hits (157), doubles (45; 2nd in the minor 
leagues), and extra-base hits (71), was 2nd in homers (26), RBIs (99), 
and slugging (.534), and 5th in batting (.300).[11] He was named a South 
Atlantic League All-Star. In 1997 at Single-A Lakeland, he led the Florida 
State League in doubles (40) and total bases (262), tied for first in extra 
base hits (65), was 2nd in games, 3rd in hits (153), tied for 3rd in home 
runs (19) and RBIs (87), was 4th in slugging percentage (.505), and tied 
for 4th in runs (87). In 1998 at AA Jacksonville Suns, he won the Southern 
League Most Valuable Player Award, as he batted .322 with a league-high 
28 home runs, 47 doubles (3rd-most in the minor leagues), and 146 RBIs 
(most in the minors in 1998 and most ever in the Southern League). His 
league record for RBIs broke the 1986 record of 132 set by Terry Steinbach. 
He also set league records with 81 extra-base hits and 319 total bases, 
and broke the old doubles record of 44 with 47. He also led the league 
in hits (176; 8th-most in the minors), runs (113; 6th-most in the minors), 
and finished 6th in batting. He played in both the Double-A and Southern 
League All-Star Games and was recognized as MVP of the Southern League 
All-Star Game. He was also named to the SL's post-season All-Star team. 
He was honored as Minor League Player of the Year by USA Today, Baseball 
Weekly, and The Sporting News and USA Today, and was named Tigers Minor 
League Player of the Year and Detroit's No. 1 prospect by Baseball America. 
He made his Major League debut in 1998 at the age of 22. He became the 
first Tiger since the inception of the draft in 1969 to be selected as 
late as the 57th round and reach the majors. He had one hit in four at-bats 
in his debut. In 1999, he hit his first career home run on April 30 against 
Albie Lopez of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He wound up hitting a career-high 
18 home runs in just over 400 at-bats, third among AL rookies. His 10 home 
runs in his first 64 games was the fastest by a Tiger rookie since 1954, 
and was not surpassed until 2008.[12] In November 1999, he was traded by 
the Tigers with Al Webb (minors), Frank Catalanotto, Francisco Cordero, 
Bill Haselman, and Justin Thompson to the Texas Rangers for Juan González, 
Danny Patterson, and Gregg Zaun.[13] Kapler hit two home runs the next 
Opening Day for the Rangers, and had a team record, major-league-high[14] 
28-game hitting streak later that season.[15] In 2000 he batted .302 with 
14 home runs, hitting .344 in the second half of the season. In 2001 he 
stole 23 bases and had 8 assists from center field for Texas. He batted 
.267, but .329 in games that were late and close. He made just one error 
in 344 total chances for a .997 fielding percentage, second-best in the 
AL. In July 2002, he was traded by the Rangers with Jason Romano and cash 
to the Colorado Rockies for Dennys Reyes and Todd Hollandsworth.[16][17] 
In 2002, he batted .279, but .321 in games that were late and close, and 
.357 with runners in scoring position. In June 2003, he was acquired by 
the Boston Red Sox from the Rockies.[18] In 2004, when Shawn Green of the 
Dodgers announced that he would not play on Yom Kippur, the Boston media 
asked Kapler if he would do the same thing. Kapler called a Boston-area 
rabbi for advice. With the Curse of the Bambino still hanging over Red 
Sox fans' heads, the rabbi reportedly said: "Do it! We need all the help 
we can get!" Kapler decided to play.[19] Kapler played a career-high 136 
games in 2004, hitting 6 home runs and driving in 33 runs in 290 at-bats. 
He batted .272, but .303 in games that were late and close. He also led 
the team with 6 outfield assists. In Game 4 of the World Series, Kapler 
had been a pinch runner, but manager Terry Francona left him in the game 
to play right field in the ninth. Kapler joined an exclusive club, as one 
of the nine players who were on the field when the Red Sox won their first 
title in 86 years.[20] Less than one month after the Red Sox dramatic 2004 
World Series victory over the Cardinals, Kapler departed for Japan's Yomiuri 
Giants. He received a $2 million deal plus a $700,000 signing bonus, compared 
to the $750,000 salary he had received from the Sox. Driven by the memory 
of an elementary-school report that he had written about Japan, he felt 
it was time for a change. "I tend to make emotional decisions," he said. 
"I did it more for the life experience than anything else. And ever since 
I wrote that report, I’ve been fascinated by everything that an 8-year-old 
associates with a country far, far away."[20] He struggled in 38 games 
in Japan, and was placed on the inactive list by Yomiuri in the 2005 mid-season.[20] 
Kapler was re-signed by the Red Sox in July 2005, just a few hours after 
clearing Japanese Central League waivers.[18] In September 2005, Kapler 
ruptured his left Achilles tendon while running the bases on what turned 
out to be a home run by teammate Tony Graffanino. This ended Kapler's season. 
In 2006, Kapler finally came back from his injury in June,[21] and had 
his best OBP in 5 years (.340), hit .316 with 2 out and runners in scoring 
position, and played error-less outfield for the second year in a row. 
Kapler announced his retirement from professional baseball on December 
12, 2006. [22] He served the Boston Red Sox as manager of their Single-A 
affiliate, the Greenville Drive, for one season in 2007.[23] The team went 
58–81, and finished in 7th place in the South Atlantic League Southern 
Division. "I miss the battle. I still need to be on the field as a player."[24] 
On September 20, 2007, after only one season as a manager, Kapler announced 
that he would like to return to play Major League Baseball in 2008. Kapler, 
32 years old at the time, had a career .270 batting average, along with 
64 home runs, with 302 runs batted in. Kapler had last played on October 
1, 2006, for the Red Sox. On December 20, 2007, Kapler signed with the 
Milwaukee Brewers to a one-year, non-guaranteed contract that paid $800,000 
when Kapler made the roster. "He knows he has to come in and win a job. 
I don't think this was about the money for him. It was about getting a 
chance to play again. He has great work ethic. People love the way he plays 
the game. He's a guy with Major League experience and can play all three 
outfield positions. And this guy is in better shape than our 25-year-old 
guys."[25] [26] The initial plan, before Mike Cameron was acquired, was 
to have Kapler replace the non-tendered Kevin Mench as a right-handed option 
to share time with Tony Gwynn, Jr., Gabe Gross, and Joe Dillon, in left 
field.[27][28] With a focus on defense, Yost indicated in March that Gwynn 
and Kapler might have a leg up on Gross.[29] "He's been very impressive 
so far", said Brewers manager Ned Yost in March.[30] "I would have never 
known he took a year off. He does not show any signs of it to me.[31] While 
Cameron served a 25-game suspension to start the season for twice testing 
positive for a banned stimulant in the fall of 2007,[32] Kapler made the 
club, and began to see action in center field.[32][33] On April 5, 2008, 
he hit the first pinch-hit home run of his career for Milwaukee in the 
7th inning of a game against the San Francisco Giants. Kapler started the 
season as the Brewers' hottest hitter, going 11-for-26 with 4 home runs 
and 11 RBIs.[34] Kapler gave fans a taste of his hard-nosed style against 
the Dodgers on August 16. He ran full-speed after Russell Martin's long 
fly in the seventh inning, snagging the ball to deprive Martin of a home 
run as he toppled head-first into the left-field seats.[35] The outstanding 
catch helped the Brewers hold onto a one-run lead, and earned Kapler the 
Play of the Year Award, voted by over 12 million fans in major league baseball's 
This Year in Baseball Awards.[36] Similarly, three days later Kapler made 
a diving catch in left field to rob Ty Wigginton of a hit,[37] and on September 
6 Kapler ran down a blooper to center and made an outstanding diving catch.[38] 
Kapler missed the last two weeks of the season as well as the NLDS after 
tearing his latissimus dorsi muscle while pitching in mid-September.[39] 
""He's as good a backup outfielder as there is in baseball. He could be 
a starter on most teams."[40][41] For the year, Kapler batted .301, with 
a .498 slugging percentage, hit 8 home runs, and was 3 for 4 in stolen 
bases, playing most of his games in center field, and batting .386 with 
a .632 slugging percentage in tie games. Kapler started 43 games. He was 
the club's best pinch-hitter, batting .323 with 2 homers (the first pinch-hit 
shots of his career) and 8 RBIs.[42] Kapler was mentioned as a candidate 
for, but did not win, the NL Comeback Player of the Year Award.[43] On 
October 30, 2008, Kapler filed for free agency.[44] On January 12, 2009, 
Kapler signed a one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Rays for $1,000,018. 
The extra $18 was chosen because it represented the symbol for "life" in 
Judaism.[45][46] He started the season platooning in center field with 
Matt Joyce, in place of Rays center fielder B.J. Upton, who had offseason 
surgery on his left shoulder, and was not ready for Opening Day.[47] On 
April 13, 2009, Kapler struck out against New York Yankee outfielder Nick 
Swisher.[21] Kapler then began to platoon in right field with Gabe Gross. 
Kapler ended the season at .354 with 4 homers in 82 at bats against left-handers.[48][49] 
In this role he almost broke Mark Buehrle's Perfect Game on July 23, 2009. 
Leading off the ninth inning against the White Sox, he was robbed of a 
home run by a leaping DeWayne Wise, a ninth inning defensive replacement.[50] 
Through July 10, despite a slow start, Kapler had the best slugging percentage 
of his career (.505), and was batting .320 with a 4 home runs in 75 at 
bats and a .680 slugging percentage against left-handers.[51] As of July 
10, 64% of his hits in 2009 had been for extra bases, which would be first 
in the major leagues for a player with at least 100 plate appearances (Kapler 
had 129).[52] Kapler was re-signed by the Rays on October 27, 2009, to 
another one-year contract, this time for $1.05 million.[53] Over 2009-09, 
Kapler hit .304 against left-handers with a .577 slugging percentage, 11th-best 
in the Major Leagues. "Over the past two years, Kap has been one of the 
best in baseball against left-handed pitching", said Rays executive vice 
president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman. "Because he's also a 
plus defensive outfielder, he's become a tremendous asset here. His value 
even extends beyond the field; his knowledge and presence make him a positive 
influence on our younger players."[54] In a December interview manager 
Joe Maddon said: "I'm still a big Gabe Kapler fan. You look at his OPS 
over the last couple of years versus left-handed pitching, it's among the 
best in all of baseball".[55] Heading into spring training in 2010, it 
appeared that Kapler was likely to platoon in right field with Matt Joyce.[56] 
However, he appeared in only 59 games that season, hitting a career worst 
.210 with only 2 home runs and became a free agent after the season. On 
January 18, 2011, Kapler signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers.[57] He also received an invitation to spring training. Kapler 
was released on March 31, 2011.[58] Kapler coached for the Israeli national 
baseball team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic qualifier in September 
2012.[59] Israel lost to Spain in extra innings in the Pool Finals, and 
did not qualify to play in the World Baseball Classic.[60][61] In the summer 
of 2013, Kapler became an analyst for Fox Sports 1 cable network. He appeared 
frequently on the network's Fox Sports Live program since the network debuted 
on August 17, 2013 as well as MLB Whiparound since the program's inception 
in March 2014. Two of his segments were "Saberclips", where he explained 
advanced statistics and sabermetrics used in baseball, and also "In the 
Cage", where he gave out advice for young baseball players what to train 
for when they hit the batting cage. On November 7, 2014, he was hired by 
the Dodgers to become the team's new Director of Player Development.[62] 
In that position, he managed to make all the affiliates in the Dodgers 
farm system, as well as the major league team, switch to serving entirely 
organic food.[63] He was one of the favorites to become the new Dodgers 
manager following the departure of Don Mattingly[64] but lost out to Dave 
Roberts.[65] Kapler and his wife, Lisa, co-founded the Gabe Kapler Foundation, 
which is dedicated to educating the public about domestic violence and 
helping women escape abusive relationships.[66] Kapler was born in Hollywood, 
California. Kapler and his wife, Lisa (Jansen),[67] have two sons, Chase 
Ty and Dane Rio.[68] Kapler filed for divorce from his wife in October 
2013.[69][70] Kapler is well known in baseball for his extraordinary musculature. 
Boston Globe columnist Bob Ryan nicknamed Kapler "The Body."[71] In a clubhouse 
poll, it was once revealed that of the 25 players on the Red Sox, 24 were 
Republicans and Kapler was the one Democrat.[72] Kapler has 11 tattoos, 
mostly on his legs, including the Star of David, and "Never Again, 1933–1945", 
referencing The Holocaust.[73][74] 56. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1753582/
