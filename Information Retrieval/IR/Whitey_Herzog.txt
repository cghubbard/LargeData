As player As manager Dorrel Norman Elvert "Whitey" Herzog (/ˈhɜːrzɒɡ/; 
born November 9, 1931) is a former Major League Baseball manager. Born 
in New Athens, Illinois, he made his debut as a player in 1956 with the 
Washington Senators. After his playing career ended in 1963, Herzog went 
on to perform a variety of roles in Major League Baseball, including scout, 
manager, general manager and farm system director. Most noted for his success 
as a manager, he led the Kansas City Royals to three consecutive playoff 
appearances from 1976 to 1978. Hired by Gussie Busch in 1980 to helm the 
St. Louis Cardinals, the Cardinals won the 1982 World Series and made two 
other World Series appearances in 1985 and 1987 under Herzog's direction. 
He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 25, 2010, and was 
inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum on August 16, 
2014. A left-handed batter and thrower, Herzog originally signed with the 
New York Yankees by scout Lou Maguolo.[1] While he never appeared in a 
major league game for them, Herzog was profoundly influenced by their manager, 
Casey Stengel, during several spring training sessions with the Yanks. 
After being traded by New York as a prospect, he played for the Washington 
Senators (1956–58), Kansas City Athletics (1958–60), Baltimore Orioles 
(1961–62) and Detroit Tigers (1963). In eight seasons, Herzog batted .254 
with 25 home runs, 172 runs batted in, 213 runs scored, 60 doubles, 20 
triples, and 13 stolen bases in 634 games. In reference to his success 
as a player versus his success as a manager, Herzog once said, "Baseball 
has been good to me since I quit trying to play it." (Herzog has made this 
statement several times, most recently in an interview with Fox Sports 
Midwest which has aired several times in August and September 2007 during 
St. Louis Cardinals rain delays).[2] After his playing career ended, Herzog 
rejoined the Athletics for two seasons, as a scout in 1964[3][4] and a 
coach in 1965. The next seven years were spent with the New York Mets, 
the first, in 1966, as the third-base coach for manager Wes Westrum. Beginning 
in 1967 Herzog then made his mark with the club as its director of player 
development for the next six campaigns. Under his watch, the Mets produced 
young talent that either became part of the nucleus of its World Series 
teams in 1969 and 1973 or eventually had successful major league careers. 
Among them were Gary Gentry, Wayne Garrett, Jon Matlack, John Milner, Amos 
Otis and Ken Singleton. Herzog was a candidate to become the Mets' manager 
after the death of Gil Hodges prior to the 1972 season, but was passed 
over in favor of first-base coach Yogi Berra by chairman of the board M. 
Donald Grant.[5] Perceiving Grant's actions as a snub,[5] Herzog left the 
Mets to accept the first managerial assignment of his career when he signed 
a two-year contract with the Texas Rangers on November 2, 1972.[6] He took 
over a ballclub that finished 1972 in last place in the American League 
(AL) West with the majors' worst record at 54–100 under Ted Williams.[7] 
Hired based on recommendations from general manager Joe Burke to owner 
Bob Short, Herzog had the understanding that he was to help develop the 
team's young prospects.[8] His debut at the helm was a 3–1 Rangers loss 
to the Chicago White Sox at Arlington Stadium on April 7, 1973. His first 
victory was a 4–0 decision over the Kansas City Royals five nights later 
on April 12 at Royals Stadium.[9] He never got the chance to finish the 
1973 season. Three days after a 14–0 defeat to the White Sox at Comiskey 
Park and Texas with a 47–91 record,[9] he was dismissed on September 7.[8] 
He was succeeded in the interim for one game by Del Wilber and in the longer 
term by Billy Martin, who had been fired by the Detroit Tigers on August 
30.[6] Short defended the change by telling reporters, "If my mother were 
managing the Rangers and I had the opportunity to hire Billy Martin, I'd 
fire my mother."[8] Herzog continued building his managerial credentials 
with the California Angels (1974 on an interim basis; as a coach, he filled 
in between the firing of Bobby Winkles and the hiring of Dick Williams.[10]), 
Kansas City Royals (1975–79) and St. Louis Cardinals (1980–90). He had 
his greatest success in Kansas City, where he won three straight American 
League Western division titles from 1976 to 1978, and in St. Louis, where 
he won the 1982 World Series and the National League Pennant in 1985 and 
1987. In total, he led six division winners, three pennant winners, and 
one World Series winner in compiling a 1,281–1,125 (.532) career record. 
With his extensive background in player development, Herzog also was a 
general manager with both the Cardinals (1980–82)[11] and the California 
Angels. He succeeded Jack Krol as manager of the Redbirds in 1980,[12] 
managed for 73 games, then moved into the club's front office as GM on 
August 26, turning the team over to Red Schoendienst. During the offseason, 
Herzog reclaimed the manager job, then held both the GM and field manager 
posts with St. Louis for almost two full seasons, during which he acquired 
or promoted many players who would star on the Cards' three World Series 
teams of the 1980s.[11] Herzog's style of play, based on the strategy of 
attrition, was nicknamed "Whiteyball"[13] and concentrated on pitching, 
speed, and defense to win games rather than on home runs. Herzog's lineups 
generally consisted of one or more base-stealing threats at the top of 
the lineup, with a power threat such as George Brett or Jack Clark hitting 
third or fourth, protected by one or two hitters with lesser power, followed 
by more base stealers. This tactic kept payrolls low, while allowing Herzog 
to win consistently in stadiums with deep fences and artificial turf, both 
of which were characteristics of Royals Stadium (now Kauffman Stadium) 
and Busch Memorial Stadium during his managerial career. A less noticed 
(at the time) aspect of Herzog's offensive philosophy was his preference 
for patient hitters with high on-base percentages:[14] such players included 
Royals Brett, Hal McRae, and Amos Otis, and Cardinals Clark, Keith Hernandez, 
José Oquendo, and Ozzie Smith, as well as Darrell Porter, who played for 
Herzog in both Kansas City and St. Louis. However, in St. Louis Herzog 
also employed free-swinging hitters who were less patient but fast runners, 
such as Vince Coleman and Willie McGee. Herzog also expressed an interest 
in becoming President of the National League when that job opened in 1986.[15] 
The role eventually went to Yale University President A. Bartlett Giamatti, 
who also became the Commissioner of baseball in 1989. In a nationally-televised 
interview on NBC, after Giamatti accepted the job of NL President, Marv 
Albert jokingly asked Herzog if he would be interested in the job opening 
for President of Yale University. Herzog replied, "Well, you're trying 
to be funny now, Marv. I don't think that's funny at all."[16] Herzog's 
final season with the Cardinals, and in his managerial career, was the 
1990 season.[17] He finished with a record of 784 wins and 693 losses during 
his second stint as Cardinals manager.[17] Overall, his Cardinals record 
is 822 wins and 728 losses.[17] His career managerial record is 1,281 wins 
and 1,125 losses.[17] After leaving the Cardinals in 1990, Herzog then 
held various front office and consulting posts with the Angels, including 
a brief stint (1993–94) as general manager. Herzog and Jim Leyland were 
leading candidates to become manager of the Boston Red Sox following the 
1996 season. Both rejected offers from the Red Sox, so the team hired Jimy 
Williams instead.[18] Herzog was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by 
the Veterans' Committee on December 7, 2009, receiving 14 of a possible 
16 votes.[19] Herzog's induction into the Hall of Fame was on July 25, 
2010.[19] In addition, the Cardinals retired the number '24', which he 
wore during his managerial tenure with the club, in his honor on July 31, 
following his induction.[20] Rick Ankiel was the last Cardinal to wear 
number 24. His younger brother, Codell ("Butz") died on Feb. 20, 2010, 
at 76. He made out Whitey's first lineup with the Cardinals in 1980.[21] 
His grandson John Urick was a minor league first baseman and outfielder 
from 2003 until 2010 who played for managers and former Herzog-era Cardinals 
Garry Templeton and Hal Lanier.[22][23] In January, 2014, the Cardinals 
announced Herzog among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into 
the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of
