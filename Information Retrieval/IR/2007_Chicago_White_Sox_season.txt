The Chicago White Sox' 2007 season started off with the White Sox trying 
to re-claim the AL Central title, an achievement they last achieved in 
2005, when they went on to win the 2005 World Series. They failed to win 
consecutive AL Central championships when the Minnesota Twins won it in 
2006. They finished the season 72-90, 4th place in the AL Central. Notable 
events include Mark Buehrle pitching a no-hitter on April 18, 2007. On 
August 12, 2007 closer Bobby Jenks retired his 41st consecutive hitter, 
Yuniesky Betancourt, to tie the Major League record for most consecutive 
hitter retired in a row. He is tied with Jim Barr, who set it with the 
San Francisco Giants over two games on August 23, 1972 and August 29, 1972. 
On September 16, 2007 Jim Thome hit his 500th career home run with a two-run 
shot in the bottom of the 9th inning to beat the Los Angeles Angels of 
Anaheim 9-7. Thome is the first player in club history to hit his 500th 
career home run while in a White Sox uniform. With their 72-90 record, 
the White Sox finished with their first losing season since 1999. The 2006–2007 
offseason stirred up controversy among Sox fans. First, on November 16, 
lefty reliever Neal Cotts[1] was sent to the Chicago Cubs for reliever 
David Aardsma and prospect Carlos Vásquez. This was the first deal between 
the crosstown rivals since the Cubs traded pitcher Jon Garland for White 
Sox reliever Matt Karchner in the middle of the 1998 season. A deal that 
involved trading Garland to the Houston Astros for outfielder Willy Taveras 
and pitchers Taylor Buchholz and Jason Hirsh was reported to have been 
agreed upon, but general manager Ken Williams backed out of the trade at 
the last minute, due to health concerns for Buchholz. Williams traded first 
baseman Ross Gload to the Kansas City Royals for reliever Andrew Sisco. 
On December 6, starting pitcher Freddy García was traded to the Philadelphia 
Phillies for pitching prospects Gavin Floyd and Gio Gonzalez, who was initially 
traded to the Phillies by the White Sox in the Jim Thome deal a year prior. 
Even more controversial was the December 23 deal that sent highly touted 
starter Brandon McCarthy, along with outfield prospect David Paisano, to 
the Texas Rangers for pitching prospects John Danks, Nick Masset, and Jacob 
Rasner. To some, it seemed as if Williams was sacrificing the present for 
the future in these deals. The Sox also signed free agent catcher Toby 
Hall, signed free agent outfielder/first baseman Darin Erstad, and signed 
Javier Vázquez to a 3-year, $33 million contract extension. [1] [2] [3]
