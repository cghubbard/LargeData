New Britain is a city in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. It 
is located approximately 9 miles (14 km) southwest of Hartford. According 
to 2010 Census, the population of the city is 73,206.[1] Among the southernmost 
of the communities encompassed within the Hartford-Springfield Knowledge 
Corridor metropolitan region, New Britain is home to Central Connecticut 
State University and Charter Oak State College. The city's official nickname 
is the "Hardware City" because of its history as a manufacturing center 
and as the headquarters of Stanley Black & Decker. Because of its large 
Polish population, the city is often playfully referred to as "New Britski."[2] 
New Britain was settled in 1687 and then was incorporated as a new parish 
under the name New Britain Society in 1754. Chartered in 1850 as a township 
and in 1871 as a city, New Britain had separated from the nearby town of 
Farmington, Connecticut. A consolidation charter was adopted in 1905. During 
the early part of the 20th century, New Britain was known as the "Hardware 
Capital of the World", as well as "Hardware City". Major manufacturers, 
such as The Stanley Works, the P&F Corbin Company (later Corbin Locks), 
and North & Judd, were headquartered in the city. In 1843 Frederick Trent 
Stanley established Stanley's Bolt Manufactory in New Britain to make door 
bolts and other wrought-iron hardware. In 1857 his cousin Henry Stanley 
founded The Stanley Rule and Level Company in the city. Planes invented 
by Leonard Bailey and manufactured by the Stanley Rule and Level Company, 
known as "Stanley/Bailey" planes, were prized by woodworkers of the late 
19th and early 20th centuries and remain popular among wood craftsmen today. 
The two companies merged in 1920, and the Stanley Rule and Level Company 
became the Hand Tools Division of Stanley Works. The wire coat hanger was 
invented in 1869 by O. A. North of New Britain. In 1895, the basketball 
technique of dribbling was developed at the New Britain YMCA. In 1938, 
New Britain High School competed in the high school football national championship 
game in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 1954 saw the development of racquetball, 
also at the YMCA.[3] New Britain's motto, Industria implet alveare et melle 
fruitur – translated from Latin – means "Industry fills the hive and enjoys 
the honey." This phrase was coined by Elihu Burritt, a 19th-century New 
Britain resident, diplomat, philanthropist and social activist. In 2007 
it was reported that the Latin word for "honey" in the motto had been a 
typo for decades; it should be melle, but it had long been misspelled as 
mele. Former mayor William McNamara, who unsuccessfully tried to fix it 
during his term, suggested "to either fix the spelling immediately" or 
"switch to the English version of the motto."[4][5] As controversy arose 
from the matter, the word was superseded with the correct spelling, melle. 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area 
of 13.4 square miles (34.7 km²), of which, 13.3 square miles (34.6 km²) 
of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.2 km²) of it (0.52%) is water. New 
Britain's terrain is mostly made up of soft, rolling hills and young Connecticut 
forest. The many parks are populated with trees, and in small, undeveloped 
areas, there is also brushy woods. New Britain's streets also have many 
trees lining the sides of the roads. Many front yards in the northern half 
of the city have at least one tree. One or two streams flow through New 
Britain, undisturbed by the development. As of the census[9] of 2010, there

Britain has the largest Polish population of any city in Connecticut, and 
by 1930 a quarter of the city was ethnically Polish.[11] Also referred 
to as "Little Poland", the city's Broad Street neighborhood has been home 
to a considerable number of Polish businesses and families since 1890. 
On September 23, 2008, through the urging of the Polonia Business Association, 
the New Britain City Council unanimously passed a resolution officially 
designating New Britain's Broad Street area as "Little Poland."[12] In 
recent years, the Polish community has been credited with revitalizing 
the area both culturally and economically. Media is served by three Polish 
language newspapers and a television station, and many businesses and civil 
agencies are bilingual. The post office branch in Little Poland is the 
only one in the nation with the word "post" written in Polish to welcome 
visitors. Each year, a Little Poland festival is held on the last Sunday 
of April. Notable visitors to the Polish district have included Presidents 
Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan on July 8, 1987.[13] In 1969, as then-Cardinal 
Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II gave a mass at Sacred Heart 
Church.[14] A statue was erected in his honor in 2007.[15] Dubbed the city's 
"Polish heart" by The Boston Globe, Little Poland caught the attention 
of Polish Ambassador to the US Ryszard Schnepf, who toured the area with 
US Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, US Congresswoman Elizabeth 
Esty, as well as several members of the Polish Sejm.[citation needed] The 
Polish influence could be in part responsible for some vowel qualities 
of the distinctive New Britain accent,[16] such as nasalization of reduced 
vowels before /n/. A more characteristic feature of the central Connecticut 
dialect is distinguished by systematic substitution of the glottal stop 
in place of [t] for an unreleased /t/ word-finally and before syllabic 
consonants (e.g. "eight" is pronounced [ɛɪʔ] instead of [eɪt]), leading 
to the shibboleth pronunciation of New Britain for many locals being [nuˈbɹɪʔɨː̃n], 
instead of [nuˈbɹɪtn̩].[17] New Britain is home to the global headquarters 
of the Fortune 500 manufacturing conglomerate Stanley Black & Decker. Other 
notable companies headquartered in New Britain include Creed Monarch, Guida's 
Dairy and Polamer Precision. According to the City's 2009 Comprehensive 
Annual Financial Report,[18] the top employers in the city are: New Britain 
is the home of the New Britain Symphony Orchestra, which was formed in 
1948 by several faculty members at the former Teacher’s College, now Central 
Connecticut State University. The orchestra performed its first concert 
under the direction of Dr. Etzel Willhoit, President of the College. The 
orchestra was official organized as the New Britain Symphony Society, Inc. 
in 1952 by Helen Kilduff, who was at the time the supervisor of music in 
New Britain’s public schools.[19] Maestro Ertan Seyyar Sener is the current 
conductor and musical director of the New Britain Symphony Orchestra, a 
role he assumed during the 2014-2015 concert season. New Britain is also 
home to the historic Repertory Theatre. The theatre was originally the 
Norden Street Lodge. In 1955, a theater group known as the Repertory Theatre 
of New Britain acquired the Norden Street Lodge. The lodge became known 
as The Repertory Theatre, as it is to this day. Members of the Repertory 
Theatre of New Britain sold bonds to theatre members and friends in order 
to acquire the property. Each year, bondholders received interest on their 
investment, sometimes reaching as much as 65 cents! Since 1955, at least 
four theatrical productions have been produced each year in the space. 
Since 1999, the theatre has also been home to numerous cultural events, 
children’s theatre and playwriting competitions. There have been notable 
names to grace the stage, such as Meryl Streep, who was active in children’s 
theatre at the Repertory Theatre during her time as a student at Yale University. 
The city is home to Central Connecticut State University and Charter Oak 
State College, a public liberal arts college. New Britain Public Schools 
operates public schools. The local high school is New Britain High School. 
New Britain is also home to the Mountain Laurel Sudbury School. Connecticut 
Route 9 is the city's main expressway connecting traffic between Hartford 
(via I-84 and I-91) and Old Saybrook and Middletown. I-84 itself clips 
the northwestern corner of the city. Public transportation is provided 
by Connecticut Transit. Downtown New Britain serves as the southern terminus 
of CTfastrak, a bus rapid transit line. Operated by Connecticut Transit, 
the project officially broke ground in May 2012, and became operational 
in March 2015.[21][22] The route's northern terminus is Union Station in 
Hartford. There are also CTfastrak stations on East Main Street and East 
Street, the latter near Central Connecticut State University. New Britain 
is served by Connecticut Transit New Britain. New Britain has a nearby 
Amtrak station in adjacent Berlin. The Vermonter (once daily) and Shuttle 
(multiple daily arrivals/departures) provide service to destinations throughout 
the northeastern United States. There are also plans underway for a Springfield–Hartford–New 
Haven commuter rail, which would have Berlin as one of its stations. New 
Britain has five sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:
