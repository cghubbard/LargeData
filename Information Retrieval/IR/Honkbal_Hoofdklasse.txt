The Honkbal Hoofdklasse (Dutch for Major League Baseball) is the highest 
level of professional baseball in the Netherlands. It is an eight-team 
league that plays a 42-game schedule and is overseen by the Royal Netherlands 
Baseball and Softball Federation (KNBSB). Games are played principally 
on weekends. The season runs from April to September and is followed by 
the playoffs among the four best teams, which culminates in the Holland 
Series. Both of the playoff rounds are best-of-five. The league follows 
a promotion and relegation system with the Honkbal Overgangsklasse so that 
the composition of both levels changes from year to year. Many of the official 
team nicknames contain the name of the club's corporate sponsor. The two 
best teams participate in the European Cup. The 2013 Honkbal Hoofdklasse

in the Hoofdklasse for the first time. Sparta/Feyenoord, the relegated 
team from the 2012 season, was declared bankrupt by the Rotterdam court 
on November 22, 2012[2] and did not compete in the Overgangsklasse. Eight 
teams will participate in the 2015 season. DSS was promoted from the Honkbal 
Overgangsklasse after defeating Mampaey The Hawks in the relegation series 
at the end of the 2014 season. Despite losing the relegation series, Mampaey 
The Hawks were reinstated into the league in February 2015 after AdoLakers
