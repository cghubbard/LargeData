Nancy Bea Hefley (born February 24 in San Pedro, California) is the long-time 
stadium organist for Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers. Bea grew 
up in the Los Angeles area, and began playing the piano at age 4 by listening

her piano teacher into teaching her the basics of the organ. Nancy has 
been playing the organ at Bellflower Baptist Church for over 55 years; 
it was there that she met her husband, Bill. She also plays the organ at 
the Orange County Fair, the Pomona Fair, and has played shows in Las Vegas 
and Lake Tahoe. In the mid-1980s, Bea filled in for a friend as the organist 
for California Angels games at Angel Stadium, and was offered a job which 
she declined not wishing to take work from a friend. When it was announced 
in 1987 that long-time Dodger organist Helen Dell was to retire at the 
end of the season after fifteen years, Bea auditioned at an exhibition 
game between the Dodgers and the USC Trojans on February 14, 1988.[1] She 
does not plan her songs, getting her musical cues from the events occurring

late 1980s to the present day, Bea– alongside announcers Vin Scully and 
Rick Monday– became great crowd favorites at Dodger Stadium. On October
