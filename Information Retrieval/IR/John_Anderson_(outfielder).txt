John Joseph Anderson (December 14, 1873 in Sarpsborg, Norway – July 23, 
1949) was a Major League outfielder and first baseman. Nicknamed "Honest 
John", Anderson played for six seasons in the National League from 1894 
to 1899 and then in the American League from 1900 to 1908. Anderson was 
the first of only three Major League baseball players to have ever been 
born in the country. He first appeared in the National League in 1894, 
when he signed with the Brooklyn Grooms. He spent the next three full seasons 
with Brooklyn and was primarily used as an outfielder, and batted over 
.300 in both 1896 and 1897. During the 1898 season, he was sold to the 
Washington Senators, only to be sold back to Brooklyn four months later. 
Nevertheless, he managed to have one of his best seasons, leading the National 
League with 22 triples and also leading the league in slugging percentage 
and extra-base hits. Anderson stayed in Brooklyn for the 1899 before being 
purchased by the Milwaukee Brewers of the newly formed American League. 
Anderson was one of the league's best hitters in the AL's first year as 
a Major League in 1901. (In 1900, the American League was still considered 
a minor league.) As the Brewers' first baseman, he finished second in the 
league in base hits and doubles, trailing only Nap Lajoie in both categories, 
ranked third in runs batted in behind Lajoie and Buck Freeman, and was 
sixth in the league with a .330 average. He stayed with the franchise when 
it relocated to St. Louis in 1902 to become the Browns. He played two seasons 
in St. Louis and recorded virtually identical .284 batting averages in 
those years. On September 24, 1903, Anderson tried to steal second base 
when the base was already occupied. This particular mistake was often referred 
to as a "John Anderson play" in the early part of the century [1] Anderson 
was dealt to the New York Highlanders before the 1904 season in exchange 
for Jack O'Connor. He played one full season in New York and batted .278 
with the club. He started the 1905 season in New York but was waived after 
a slow start. The Washington Senators (officially a different franchise 
from the team he played for in 1898) claimed him off of waivers, and he 
recovered to bat .279 on the season, good enough for ninth in the AL in 
the midst of the dead-ball era. He remained in Washington for the next 
two seasons. In 1906, Anderson tied for the American League lead in stolen 
bases with Elmer Flick. He left Washington after his contract was purchased 
by the Chicago White Sox for the 1908 season. He played for one season 
with the Pale Hose to end his career in the Major Leagues. Anderson retired 
with a .290 career average, 49 home runs, and 976 runs batted in. He also 
finished his career with 124 triples, currently tying him for 90th place 
all-time in that category. He died at the age of 74 in Worcester, Massachusetts.
