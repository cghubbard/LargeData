United States. As of the 2010 U.S. Census, the town's population was 26,563. 
Bridgewater is located approximately 25 miles (40 km) south of Boston and 
approximately 35 miles east of Providence, Rhode Island.[1] According to 
the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 28.2 square 
miles (73 km2), of which 27.5 square miles (71 km2) is land and 0.7 square 
miles (1.8 km2) (2.62%) is water. Bridgewater is 99th out of the 351 communities 
in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and eighth out of the twenty-seven 
municipalities in Plymouth County in terms of land area. The town is bordered 
by West Bridgewater to the northwest, East Bridgewater to the northeast, 
Halifax to the east, Middleborough to the south, and Raynham to the west. 
Bridgewater is approximately 5 miles south of Brockton, 10 miles northeast 
of Taunton, and 25 miles south of Boston, of which it is a suburb. Neighborhoods 
in Bridgewater include Stanley, Scotland Park, Pratt Town, Paper Mill Village, 
and South Bridgewater. Bridgewater lies along the Taunton River, which 
has several other rivers and brooks which branch off the main waterway. 
There are also several ponds, the largest of which is Lake Nippenicket 
along the western edge of the town. There is a state forest, a town forest, 
several conservation areas and a large portion of the Hockomock Swamp Wildlife 
Management Area, in the western part of town. Parts of this swamp give 
rise to the so-called Bridgewater Triangle, a small area of concentrated 
reports of strange Fortean phenomena, colonial "dark days", Bigfoot and 
mysterious black panthers, UFO sightings, and other weird encounters, a 
phrase coined by Loren Coleman, author of Mysterious America, often compared 
to the Bermuda Triangle.[2] As of the census[13] of 2000, there were 25,185 
people, 7,526 households, and 5,584 families residing in the town. The

is the 71st largest town in the Commonwealth by population, and 110th by 
population density. In the county, Bridgewater ranks third in population 
and seventh in density. In the late 1960s, the economy of Bridgewater was 
dependent upon the Old Colony Correctional Center and other Massachusetts 
Correctional Institutions of the MCD in Bridgewater, Bridgewater State 
Hospital and the Bridgewater Teacher's College (now the Bridgewater State 
University). Donald Cabana, who served as a prison guard at the Bridgewater 
prison and later became the superintendent of the Mississippi State Penitentiary, 
said that "the community promoted the fact that it was home to the United 
States's first "normal school" (teachers' college), while the prison was 
"often mentioned in less glowing terms". Also, for most of the 1800s and 
beginning of the 1900s, Bridgewater's economy was largely dependent on 
the factories located within the town. Bridgewater is renowned and known 
for its iron works factories. One of which is appropriately named Bridgewater 
Iron Works, and is a registered historical site in Massachusetts. The majority 
of the Iron Works factory was torn down in 1994 and turned into a park, 
which is named Ironworks Park. Still, to this day, Bridgewater has numerous 
iron works companies still in business, namely Ashmont Iron Works, and 
Superior Nail & Iron. The town also had multiple paper mills, saw mills, 
and a boot & shoe factory. The old boot & shoe factory still stands today 
off Broad St. adjacent to the MBTA Commuter Train rail tracks and the Burger 
King. Although the factory no longer manufactures shoes, it still houses 
numerous businesses and storage units to this day.[14] Bridgewater was 
formerly governed on the local level by the open town meeting form of government, 
led by a Board of Selectmen until January 2011. Bridgewater is now led 
by seven Precinct Councilors, 1 per precinct, and two "at-large councilors", 
with an appointed Town Manager, Assessor, Tax Collector, for a total of 
nine Councilors.[15] Bridgewater is one of fourteen Massachusetts municipalities 
that have applied for, and been granted, city forms of government but wish 
to retain "The town of” in their official names.[16] This is from the majority 
'Yes' vote on Question #1 at the April 24, 2010 annual town election, to 
change from a five-person, elected Board of Selectmen to a nine-person, 
elected Town Council, and thus abolishing the Annual Town Meeting, which 
was held in 2010 after generations.[15][17] Town facilities are located 
at the center of town, with the Police Department headquarters being just 
west of the Square along Mass. Route 104. There are two fire departments 
in town, one next to the College and the other in the eastern part of town, 
directly behind the Town Hall. There is one U.S. Post Office branch, located 
just north of the town center along Mass. Route 18. The town's Bridgewater 
Public Library is just north of the town center, and is a part of the Southeastern 
Area Internet Library Services ("SAILS") network.[18][19] On the Commonwealth 
level, Bridgewater is represented in the Massachusetts House of Representatives 
of the General Court of Massachusetts as a portion of the Eighth Plymouth 
District, which includes Raynham and a small portion of Easton. In the 
Massachusetts Senate, the Town is a part of the First Plymouth and Bristol 
District, which also includes Berkley, Carver, Dighton, Marion, Middleborough, 
Raynham, Taunton and Wareham.[20] The Town is also patrolled by the Fourth 
(Middleborough) Barracks of Troop 'D' of the Massachusetts State Police.[21] 
The Massachusetts Department of Correction operates several correctional 
facilities in the Bridgewater Correctional Complex in Bridgewater.[22] 
The prisons in the complex include Bridgewater State Hospital,[23] Massachusetts 
Alcohol and Substance Abuse Center,[24] Massachusetts Treatment Center,[25] 
and Old Colony Correctional Center.[22] On the national level, Bridgewater 
is a part of Massachusetts's 8th congressional district, which has been 
represented in the United States House of Representatives since 2001 by 
Stephen Lynch, a Democrat. The Commonwealth's senior member of the United 
States Senate, elected in 2012, is Elizabeth Warren, since the nomination 
and appointment of former U.S. Senator John Kerry as United States Secretary 
of State in 2013.[26] The junior Senator is Ed Markey, first elected in 
the 2013 special election to fill Ted Kennedy's seat. The Town also has 
a Massachusetts National Guard armory along Mass. Route 18. Bridgewater 
shares its school district with neighboring Raynham, with both towns operating 
their own elementary and middle schools, and sending their students to 
a common high school. Bridgewater has one elementary school, George H. 
Mitchell Elementary School (south and west of the town center - formerly 
known as Bridgewater Elementary), which serves students from kindergarten 
through grade three. All the fourth, fifth, and sixth graders attend M.G. 
Williams Intermediate School, while seventh and eighth graders attend Bridgewater 
Middle School. The Bridgewater-Raynham Regional High School is located 
in Bridgewater, west of the town center. B-R's athletics teams are nicknamed 
the "Trojans", and their colors are red and white. The athletic teams of 
the Bridgewater Middle School use the "Spartans" nickname. Bridgewater 
was formerly home to two private schools which served students from preschool 
(Joyful Learning) and kindergarten through sixth grade (Southbrook Academy) 
until their closings after the 2012-2013 school year. There are also private 
schools in nearby Taunton and Brockton. Bridgewater was formerly the site 
of the well-known, influential Bridgewater Academy, a private high school 
formerly located on the "Town Common" (park). It was attended by many leading 
young men of the area in the early and mid 19th Century, including a well-known 
Massachusetts-born merchant/philanthropist Enoch Pratt (1808-1896), in 
the late 1830s, who endowed the Public Library in his hometown of North 
Middleborough and also set up the world-famous Enoch Pratt Free Library, 
one of the first free public library systems in America. The town is also 
home to Bridgewater State University, a public liberal arts university 
that was originally founded as a "normal school" (now teachers' school) 
in 1840. It is the largest of the state's nine state universities outside 
of the University of Massachusetts system itself. As of 2015, approximately 
10,000 undergraduate students and 1,800 postgraduate students are enrolled 
at the college.[27] Bridgewater is the site of the intersection of Interstate 
495 and Mass. Route 24, with only a one-mile stretch of the interstate 
highway running through the southwestern corner of the Town. Just north 
of this intersection along Mass. Route 24 are two large service areas, 
both of which have restaurants and a gas station. They are the only two 
such full service areas along Mass. Route 24, or, for that matter, anywhere 
along the highways of Southeastern Massachusetts (aside from a stop along 
U.S. Route 6 in Barnstable; that stop, however, is considered to be off 
the highway). At the center of town, Mass. Route 18, Mass. Route 28 and 
Mass. Route 104 meet at the Town Common. Mass. Routes 18 and 28, both north-south 
routes, are coextensive from this point south to the road's intersection 
with U.S. Route 44 in Middleborough. Mass. Route 104 passes from east to 
west, with ramp access to Mass. Route 24 in the west. A short portion of 
Mass. Route 106 passes along the town line in the northeast of town; Mass. 
Route 104 's eastern terminus is at that route, just along the East Bridgewater 
line. The Middleborough-Lakeville line of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation 
Authority (MBTA) commuter rail passes through the Town, with a stop at 
the southern end of Bridgewater State University's campus. The stop is 
just south of the University's main parking lots at the Southern Campus. 
There is a small air strip in nearby Taunton, and the nearest national 
air service can be found at T. F. Green Airport outside Providence and
