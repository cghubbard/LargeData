Munenori Kawasaki (川﨑 宗則, Kawasaki Munenori?, born June 3, 1981) is a Japanese-born 
professional baseball shortstop and second baseman for the Chicago Cubs 
in the Major League Baseball (MLB). Previously, he played for the Fukuoka 
SoftBank Hawks of Nippon Professional Baseball, and the Seattle Mariners 
and Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB).[1] He played for 
the Japanese national team in the 2008 Beijing Olympics as well as the 
2006[2] and 2009 World Baseball Classics. Following the Chicago Cubs' 2016 
World Series championship, Kawasaki joined Daisuke Matsuzaka and Koji Uehara 
as the only Japanese players to have won championships in the World Baseball 
Classic, Japan Series and World Series. Kawasaki was born in Aira, a town 
in central Kagoshima Prefecture in the south of Japan. He began playing 
baseball after his older brother got him into the sport. Though he was 
a pitcher throughout his early years, Kawasaki switched to shortstop after 
enrolling in Kagoshima Prefectural Technical High School. Kawasaki remained 
largely an unknown on the national level during his high school career, 
partly due to his team's failing to make any national tournaments in those 
three years. Still, he made a name for himself locally, earning the nickname 
Satsurō, a portmanteau derived from Satsuma (the name given to a former 
province of Japan in present-day western Kagoshima) and former Seattle 
Mariners outfielder Ichiro Suzuki's first name for the similarities in 
their playing styles. He was drafted in the fourth round of the 1999 NPB 
amateur draft by the then-Fukuoka Daiei Hawks. Kawasaki earned the starting 
shortstop job for the Hawks' nigun team (Japanese for "minor league" or 
"farm team") in his rookie season (2000), hitting .300 and finishing fifth 
in the Western League in batting average that year. In 2001, his second 
season in the pros, he came second (to only then-Tohoku Rakuten Golden 
Eagles outfielder Akihito Moritani) with 29 stolen bases. He made his debut 
at the ichigun (major league) level on October 3 against the Orix BlueWave 
as the starting shortstop and No. 2 hitter, but went hitless in four at-bats 
that year. Kawasaki hit .367 in the Western League the following year (2002), 
winning the batting title despite falling short of the required number 
of plate appearances because of league regulations. He got the first hit 
of his career on June 15 against right-hander Jeremy Powell, then of the 
Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes, and his first stolen base on June 19 against 
the Seibu Lions. He was called up to the ichigun team again in September 
to fill in for Tadahito Iguchi as the team's regular second baseman while 
Iguchi missed time due to injury and also played in the 15th IBAF International 
Cup as a member of the Japanese national team. In 2003, Kawasaki started 
in the Hawks' season opener for the first time in his career because of 
injuries to veteran Yusuke Torigoe, starting at shortstop as the team's 
No. 2 hitter. After Torigoe returned to the lineup, Kawasaki moved over 
to third base,[3] wreaking havoc on the basepaths along with leadoff hitter 
Arihito Muramatsu and Iguchi (who sat in the 3-hole). He hit his first 
career home run on July 28 off Buffaloes right-hander Ken Kadokura, and 
while he finished the season just short of .300, he played his first full 
season at the ichigun level and hit .294 with two homers, 51 RBI and 30 
steals,[4] playing a key role in the Hawks' league title and eventual Japan 
Series championship.[5] Kawasaki became the Hawks' starting shortstop for 
the 2004 season, playing in all 133 regular season games and hitting over 
.300 for the first time in his career. He led the league in both hits (174, 
tied with teammate and cleanup hitter Nobuhiko Matsunaka) and steals (42) 
and was chosen to both the Best Nine[6] and Golden Glove awards. Kawasaki 
declined the team's offer to change his uniform number from 52 to 8 during 
the off-season. (The number is an homage to Ichiro Suzuki, who wears the 
number 51; Kawasaki idolized Suzuki from a young age and picked the number 
because he wanted to "follow" in Suzuki's footsteps.[7]) Kawasaki had a 
somewhat disappointing season in 2005, seeing his batting average drop 
off from .303 in 2004 to .271 and his on-base percentage from .359 to just 
.326, knocking in just 36 runs and stealing only 21 bases. Despite this, 
he was named to the Japanese national team to play in the inaugural World 
Baseball Classic during the off-season. Coming off a championship in the 
inaugural World Baseball Classic, Kawasaki bounced back in 2006, hitting 
a career-high .312 and winning the Pacific League Best Nine and Golden 
Glove awards at shortstop (each for the second time). He also received 
the most fan votes at shortstop for the MLB Japan All-Star Series held 
in November, but withdrew from the tournament after injuring the ring finger 
on his right hand during Fall Training. Kawasaki suffered various injuries 
in the 2007 season,[8] twice spending time in the minors to rehab and playing 
just 95 games (though he hit .329[9] and slugged .428, both career highs). 
Kawasaki's woes continued into 2008 as he attempted to play through an 
injury to his left foot. He hit a team-high .366 in interleague games and 
collected 37 hits (leading the NPB), leading the Hawks to their first interleague 
title and winning the interleague Most Valuable Player (marking the first 
time a position player had been named to the award).[10] However, though 
he was chosen to play in the 2008 Beijing Olympics as a member of the national 
team, he was diagnosed with periostitis during the tournament. On August 
25, Kawasaki was found to have a stress fracture in his second metatarsal 
bone upon returning to Japan after the Olympics. He made an earlier-than-expected 
return, coming off the bench in the last game of the regular season (and 
then-manager Sadaharu Oh's last at the helm) on October 7 against the Eagles, 
but finished 0-for-2 with an intentional walk (the Hawks lost the game 
in extra innings). Kawasaki signed a minor league contract with an invitation 
to spring training with the Seattle Mariners prior to the 2012 Major League 
Baseball season.[11] In his professional American debut, on March 2, 2012, 
Kawasaki went 0–3 against the Oakland Athletics, with two strikeouts, starting 
at shortstop. He was replaced in the sixth inning by Carlos Triunfel.[12] 
On October 24, 2012, the Mariners announced they had released Kawasaki. 
He hit .192/.257/.202 in 115 plate appearances in 61 games.[13] Kawasaki 
agreed to a minor league deal with the Toronto Blue Jays on March 14, 2013.[14] 
He started the 2013 season on the roster of the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. 
Kawasaki was called up to the Blue Jays on April 13 when José Reyes was 
added to the disabled list.[15] With his appearance for the Blue Jays on 
April 13, Kawasaki became the first Japanese-born position player to appear 
in a game for Toronto.[16] On April 21, 2013, Kawasaki batted in the leadoff 
slot for the first time in Toronto, scoring the game's first run against 
the New York Yankees.[17] On May 26, in the final game of a 4-game series 
against the Baltimore Orioles, Kawasaki recorded his first MLB walk-off 
hit, with a 2 run double against Baltimore closer Jim Johnson.[18][19] 
On June 21, Kawasaki hit his first MLB home run, a two-run shot off Baltimore 
reliever Tommy Hunter, which tied the game 6–6. The Blue Jays would win 
the game 7–6 to extend their winning streak to 9 games.[20] Kawasaki, at 
32 years of age, became the oldest player in Blue Jays' history to hit 
his first career home run, one year older than Ken Huckaby.[21] Kawasaki 
was optioned back to Triple-A Buffalo on June 26 when Jose Reyes was activated 
from the disabled list.[22] Toronto recalled Kawasaki from Triple-A Buffalo 
on June 28 after left-fielder Melky Cabrera was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list with left knee tendonitis.[23] Kawasaki made his first MLB start at 
second base in a game against the Boston Red Sox on June 30, 2013.[24] 
Kawasaki was optioned back to Triple-A on July 13 to make room for Brett 
Lawrie.[25] Kawasaki was recalled on August 14 after Colby Rasmus was placed 
on the disabled list.[26] Kawasaki was ejected for the first time in his 
major league career on September 21, against the Boston Red Sox after being 
called out at first base by umpire Eric Cooper and then subsequently throwing 
his helmet to the ground.[27] He recorded his first career 4-hit game on 
September 25, against the Baltimore Orioles.[28] Kawasaki finished the 
2013 regular season with a .229 batting average, 1 home run, and 24 RBI 
in 96 games. The Blue Jays declined his $1 million contract option on October 
31, making him a free agent.[29] Kawasaki was awarded the GIBBY award for 
Topic of the Year on December 10, 2013, for his postgame speech on May 
26.[30] "Thank you very much. My name is Munenori Kawasaki, I come from 
Japan, I am Japaneeeeese. My teammates gave me an opportunity, so I wanted 
to do something about it." On December 24, 2013, it was announced that 
Kawasaki had signed a minor-league contract with the Blue Jays that included 
an invitation to spring training.[32] He did not make the major league 
squad, and was assigned to Triple-A Buffalo. On April 13, Kawasaki was 
recalled when Maicer Izturis was placed on the disabled list.[33] He was 
optioned back to Buffalo on April 19, when Jose Reyes was activated.[34] 
He was recalled again on June 17 when Steve Delabar was optioned to Buffalo. 
Kawasaki saw regular playing time after his call-up and appeared in 82 
games for the Blue Jays in 2014. He batted .258 with 17 RBI for the season.[35] 
Kawasaki was sent outright to the Buffalo Bisons on October 1, 2014, and 
became a free agent on October 31. The Blue Jays re-signed Kawasaki to 
a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training on January 
16, 2015.[36] On March 31, he was reassigned to minor league spring training.[37] 
The Blue Jays purchased Kawasaki's contract from Buffalo on May 21,[38] 
and optioned him back to Buffalo on May 25 when José Reyes returned from 
the disabled list. He was recalled on May 31 when Steve Tolleson was placed 
on the disabled list,[39] and optioned back on June 10.[40] On August 1, 
Kawasaki was recalled from Buffalo.[41] He was optioned back to Buffalo 
on August 9 when Cliff Pennington was added to the Blue Jays' roster.[42] 
On September 1, Kawasaki was recalled by the Blue Jays.[43] He appeared 
in 23 games in 2015, and batted .214 with 2 RBI.[44] Though Kawasaki did 
not play in the Postseason, he was invited to travel with the team and 
was present for every Postseason game in the Blue Jays' dugout. He became 
a free agent at the end of the season.[45] On January 21, 2016, Kawasaki 
signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs that included an invitation 
to spring training.[46] He was released on March 29,[47] and re-signed 
to another minor league contract later that day.[48] On April 3, he was 
added to the 40-man roster and optioned to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. He was 
recalled to the 25 man roster on April 8 when Kyle Schwarber was placed 
on the disabled list.[49] He was optioned back to Iowa on April 15, when 
Javier Báez was activated from the disabled list.[50] He was recalled on 
July 9,[51] and optioned back to Iowa on July 15.[52] On September 6, Kawasaki 
was recalled from Iowa.[53] In 14 games of 2016, Kawasaki batted .333 with 
an RBI and two stolen bases. The Cubs finished the season with a 103-58 
record for an NL Central pennant, and would eventually win the 2016 World 
Series, ending their 108-year long world champion title drought.[54] Kawasaki 
was ineligible for post-season play in 2016, but travelled with the Cubs 
throughout the playoffs and joined the team on the field for the post-game 
celebrations. Kawasaki started at shortstop, mostly as the team's No. 9 
hitter, in the inaugural World Baseball Classic[55] and played a key role 
in Japan's championship run. Hitting out of the leadoff spot for the first 
time in the tournament finals against Cuba, Kawasaki attempted to score 
on a base hit by Ichiro Suzuki in the top of the ninth inning, managing 
to brush home plate with his right hand while contorting his body and deftly 
avoiding the catcher's tag to score the tying run for Japan. While the 
Japanese media deemed the play sensational and dubbed it The Right Hand 
of God (à la former Argentine football player Diego Maradona's famous "Hand 
of God" goal), Kawasaki was later found to have injured his right elbow 
on the play and did not play in the regular season until mid April. In 
2008, Kawasaki was chosen to play in the Olympics for the first time as 
a member of the national team, but ended up playing in just three games 
(though he went 4-for-7 and scored two runs) due to a nagging left foot 
injury. Japan came up short in their medal run, finishing fourth behind 
South Korea, Cuba and the United States. Kawasaki played in the World Baseball 
Classic as a member of the national team for the second time in 2009.[56][57] 
While he played in just five games and saw only seven at-bats[58] (mostly 
as a pinch hitter) due to manager Tatsunori Hara's decision to use Saitama 
Seibu Lions second baseman Yasuyuki Kataoka over Kawasaki against left-handed 
starting pitchers, Kawasaki was instrumental in Japan's win over the United 
States in the tournament semi-finals, starting at third base as Japan's 
No. 9 hitter and going 2-for-4 with a steal and an RBI.[59][60] Listed 
at 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m) and 175 lb (79 kg), Kawasaki is best described as 
a slap hitter, utilizing his exceptional bat control and speed to get on 
base (often bunting safely to do so). However, he is somewhat lacking in 
power, even for a middle infielder, having never hit more than four home 
runs (2004, 2005, 2007) or recorded more than 31 extra-base hits (2004, 
2006) for a season. While Kawasaki is considered by many to be a great 
base stealer, having led the league in steals in 2004 with 42, his career 
stolen base percentage is 70.0 percent (as of May 13, 2009). Modern sabermetric 
theory suggests that a player needs to be successful 70 to 75 percent of 
the time in stealing bases to have any kind of positive effect on the team's 
run production.[61][62] A two-time Golden Glove award winner, Kawasaki 
has excellent range and instincts at shortstop and has improved on his 
throwing tremendously since coming into the league. He is also a versatile 
fielder, having logged time at all four infield positions (including first 
base) in the pros. Kawasaki's first son, Issho, was born on August 16,
