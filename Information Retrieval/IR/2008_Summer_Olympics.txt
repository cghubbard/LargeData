The 2008 Summer Olympic Games, officially known as the Games of the XXIX 
Olympiad (Chinese: 第二十九届夏季奥林匹克运动会; pinyin: Dì Èrshíjiǔ Jiè Xiàjì Àolínpǐkè 
Yùndònghuì) and commonly known as Beijing 2008, was a major international 
multi-sport event that took place in Beijing, China, from 8 to 24 August 
2008.[a] A total of 10,942 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees 
(NOCs) competed in 28 sports and 302 events (a total of one event more 
than the schedule of the 2004 Games). China became the 22nd nation to host 
the Olympic Games and the 18th to hold a Summer Olympic Games. It was the 
third time that the Summer Olympic Games were held in East Asia and Asia, 
after Tokyo, Japan, in 1964 and Seoul, South Korea, in 1988. The equestrian 
events were held in Hong Kong, making it the third time the events of the 
same Olympics were held under the jurisdiction of two different NOCs[b], 
while sailing was contested in Qingdao, and football events took place 
in several different cities. Beijing was awarded the Games over four competitors 
on 13 July 2001, having won a majority of votes from members of the International 
Olympic Committee (IOC) after two rounds of voting.[2] The Government of 
the People's Republic of China promoted the Games and invested heavily 
in new facilities and transportation systems. A total of 37 venues were 
used to host the events, including 12 constructed specifically for use 
at the Games. The official logo of these Olympic Games, titled "Dancing 
Beijing", refers to the host city by featuring a stylized calligraphic 
character jīng (京, meaning capital). The Games were the most watched Olympics 
in history, attracting 4.7 billion viewers worldwide.[3][4] Some politicians 
and non-governmental organizations criticized the choice of China as Olympic 
host because of the country's human rights record,[5][6] and protests by 
critics of China's human rights record, with particular focus on Tibet, 
marred the international portion of the Olympic torch relay. There were 
43 world records and 132 Olympic records set at the 2008 Summer Olympics. 
An unprecedented 86 countries won at least one medal during the Games. 
Chinese athletes won the most gold medals with 51, and with 100 medals 
in total became only the 7th different Olympic team to top an overall medal 
tally. The United States won the most total medals with 110, and placed 
second in the medal tally followed by Russia. Though there were several 
controversies, the games were deemed generally successful with the rising 
standard of competition among nations across the world. Beijing was elected 
as the host city for the 2008 Summer Olympics on 13 July 2001, during the 
112th IOC Session in Moscow, defeating bids from Toronto, Paris, Istanbul, 
and Osaka. Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, 
Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC, but failed to 
make the short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. After 
the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other 
four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the 
second round, Beijing was supported by a majority of voters, eliminating 
the need for subsequent rounds.[7] Toronto's bid was their 5th failure 
since 1960 (failed bid for 1960, 1964, 1976 and 1996 games).[8] Members 
of the IOC did not disclose their votes, but news reports speculated that 
broad international support led to China's selection, especially from developing 
nations who had received assistance from China in the construction of stadiums. 
The size of China, its increased enforcement of doping controls, and sympathy 
concerning its loss of the 2000 Summer Olympics to Sydney were all factors 
in the decision.[9] Eight years earlier, Beijing had led every round of 
voting for the 2000 Summer Olympics before losing to Sydney by two votes 
in the final round.[10] Human rights concerns expressed by Amnesty International 
and politicians in both Europe and the United States were considered by 
the delegates, according to IOC Executive Director François Carrard. Carrard 
and others suggested that the selection might lead to improvements in human 
rights in China. In addition, a number of IOC delegates who had formerly 
been athletes expressed concern about heat and air quality during the Games, 
considering the high levels of air pollution in Beijing. China outlined 
plans to address these environmental concerns in its bid application.[9] 
On 6 March 2009, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games 
reported that total spending on the games was "generally as much as that 
of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games", which was equivalent to about US$15 billion. 
They went on to claim that surplus revenues from the Games would exceed 
the original target of $16 million.[11] Other reports, however, estimated 
the total costs from $40 billion to $44 billion, which would make the Games 
"far and away the most expensive ever".[12][13][14] Its budget has since 
been exceeded by the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, which suffered from 
major cost overruns, causing the budget to exceed US$51 billion.[15][16] 
Canadian Solar Constructed the 2000m Landscape Avenue Project for the Beijing 
Olympic Games Stadium in 2008. [17] By May 2007 the construction of all 
31 Beijing-based Olympic Games venues had begun.[18] The Chinese government 
renovated and constructed six venues outside Beijing as well as 59 training 
centres. The largest structures built were the Beijing National Stadium, 
Beijing National Indoor Stadium, Beijing National Aquatics Center, Olympic 
Green Convention Center, Olympic Green, and Beijing Wukesong Culture & 
Sports Center. Almost 85% of the construction budget for the six main venues 
was funded by $2.1 billion (RMB¥17.4 billion) in corporate bids and tenders. 
Investments were expected from corporations seeking ownership rights after 
the Olympics.[19] Some events were held outside Beijing, namely football 
in Qinhuangdao, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Tianjin; sailing in Qingdao; and, 
because of the "uncertainties of equine diseases and major difficulties 
in establishing a disease-free zone", the equestrian events were held in 
Hong Kong.[20] The centrepiece of the 2008 Summer Olympics was the Beijing 
National Stadium, nicknamed "The Bird's Nest" because of its nest-like 
skeletal structure. The stadium hosted both the opening and closing ceremonies 
as well as the athletics competition.[21] Construction of the venue began 
on 24 December 2003. The Guangdong Olympic Stadium was originally planned, 
constructed, and completed in 2001 to help host the Games, but a decision 
was made to construct a new stadium in Beijing.[22] In 2001, the city held 
a bidding process to select the best arena design. Several criteria were 
required of each design, including flexibility for post-Olympics use, a 
retractable roof, and low maintenance costs.[23] The entry list was narrowed 
to thirteen final designs.[24] The bird's nest model submitted by architects 
Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron in collaboration with Li Xinggang of 
China Architecture Design and Research Group (CADG) was selected as the 
top design by both a professional panel and by a broader audience during 
a public exhibition. The selection of the design became official in April 
2003.[23] Construction of the stadium was a joint venture among the original 
designers, project architect Stefan Marbach, artist Ai Weiwei, and a group 
of CADG architects led by Li Xinggang. Its $423 million cost was funded 
by the state-owned corporate conglomerate CITIC and the Beijing State-Owned 
Assets Management Company.[23][25] The 2008 Beijing Olympics caused traditional 
Hutong neighborhoods to be cleared for the construction of modern Olympic 
stadiums. In an effort to ensure success for the games, the government 
invested billions in building new infrastructure, although clearance to 
tiny, outdated neighborhoods in Beijing called hutongs resulted (Petrun). 
Jim Yardley, a New York Times reporter interviews Pan Jinyu, a 64-year-old 
local resident: "They [the government] don’t want foreigners to see this 
scarred old face". Feng Shuqin and her husband, Zheng Zhanlin have lived 
in their house for 50 years and the family has owned the property before 
the Communists took control in 1949. The government, trying to clear the 
area, has offered them to move with a compensatory sum of $175,000 USD, 
but the family insists the land is worth $1.4 million USD (Yardley). Michael 
Meyer, an American who lives in the hutongs reported that a total of 500,000 
residents were relocated from their homes before the Olympics began (Meyer). 
To prepare for Olympic visitors, Beijing's transportation infrastructure 
was expanded. Beijing's airport underwent a major renovation with the addition 
of the new Terminal 3, designed by architect Norman Foster.[26] Within 
the city itself, Beijing's subway was doubled in capacity and length, with 
the addition of 7 lines and 80 stations to the previously existing 4 lines 
and 64 stations. Included in this expansion was a new link connecting to 
the city's airport. A fleet of thousands of buses, minibuses, and official 
cars transported spectators, athletes, and officials between venues.[27][28] 
In an effort to improve air quality, the city placed restrictions on construction 
sites and gas stations, and limited the use of commercial and passenger 
vehicles in Beijing.[29] From 20 June through 20 September, passenger vehicle 
restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit 
of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would 
take 45% of Beijing's 3.3 million cars off the streets. The boosted public 
transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions 
and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4 million 
additional passengers per day.[30] The 2008 Summer Olympics emblem was 
known as Dancing Beijing. The emblem combined a traditional Chinese red 
seal and a representation of the calligraphic character jīng (京, "national 
capital", also the second character of Beijing's Chinese name) with athletic 
features. The open arms of the calligraphic word symbolized the invitation 
from China to the world to share in its culture. IOC president Jacques 
Rogge was very happy with the emblem, saying, "Your new emblem immediately 
conveys the awesome beauty and power of China which are embodied in your 
heritage and your people."[31] The official motto for the 2008 Olympics 
was "One World, One Dream" (同一个世界 同一个梦想).[32] It called upon the whole 
world to join in the Olympic spirit and build a better future for humanity, 
and was chosen from over 210,000 entries submitted from around the world.[33] 
Following the announcement of the motto, the phrase was used by international 
advocates of Tibetan secession. Banners reading "One World, One Dream, 
Free Tibet" were unfurled from various structures around the globe in the 
lead up to the Beijing Olympics, such as from the San Francisco Golden 
Gate Bridge and the Sydney Opera House in Australia.[34] The mascots of 
Beijing 2008 were the five Fuwa, each representing both a colour of the 
Olympic rings and a symbol of Chinese culture. In 2006, the Beijing Organizing 
Committee released pictograms of 35 Olympic disciplines (for some multi-discipline 
sports, such as cycling, a single pictogram was released).[35][36] This 
set of sport icons was named the beauty of seal characters, because of 
each pictogram's likeness to Chinese seal script.[36] The 2008 Games were 
the first to be produced and broadcast entirely in high definition by the 
host broadcaster.[37] In comparison, American broadcaster NBC broadcast 
only half of the 2006 Turin Winter Games in HD.[38][39] In their bid for 
the Olympic Games in 2001, Beijing stated to the Olympic Evaluation Commission 
that there would be, "[N]o restrictions on media reporting and movement 
of journalists up to and including the Olympic Games."[40] However, some 
media outlets claimed that organizers ultimately failed to live up to this 
commitment.[c] According to Nielsen Media Research, 4.7 billion viewers 
worldwide tuned into some of the television coverage, one-fifth larger 
than the 3.9 billion who watched the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. American 
broadcaster NBC produced only 2 hours of online streaming video for the 
2006 Winter Games but produced approximately 2,200 hours of coverage for 
the 2008 Summer Games. CNN reported that, for the first time, "live online 
video rights in some markets for the Olympics have been separately negotiated, 
not part of the overall 'broadcast rights.'" The new media of the digital 
economy was said to be growing "nine times faster than the rest of the 
advertising market."[41] The international European Broadcasting Union 
(EBU) provided live coverage and highlights of all arenas only for certain 
territories on their website, Eurovisionsports.tv.[42] Many national broadcasters 
likewise restricted the viewing of online events to their domestic audiences.[43] 
The General National Copyright Administration of China announced that "individual 
(sic) and websites will face fines as high as 100,000 yuan for uploading 
recordings of Olympic Games video to the internet",[44] part of an extensive 
campaign to protect the pertinent intellectual property rights.[45][46] 
The Olympic Committee also set up a separate YouTube channel at Beijing 
2008.[47] The theme song of the 2008 Olympic Games was "You and Me," which 
was composed by Chen Qigang, the musical director of the opening ceremony. 
It was performed during the opening ceremony by Chinese singer Liu Huan 
and British singer Sarah Brightman.[48][49] The design of the 2008 Olympic 
Torch was based on traditional scrolls and used a traditional Chinese design 
known as the "Propitious Clouds" (祥云). The torch was designed to remain 
lit in 65 km/h (40 mph) winds, and in rain of up to 50 mm (2 in) per hour.[50] 
The relay, with the theme "Journey of Harmony", was met with protests and 
demonstrations by pro-Tibet supporters throughout its journey. It lasted 
130 days and carried the torch 137,000 km (85,000 mi)—the longest distance 
of any Olympic torch relay since the tradition began at the 1936 Berlin 
Games.[51][52] The torch relay was described as a "public relations disaster" 
for China by USA Today,[53] with protests against China's human rights 
record, particularly focused on Tibet. The IOC subsequently barred future 
Olympics organizers from staging international torch relays.[54] The relay 
began 24 March 2008, in Olympia, Greece. From there, it traveled across 
Greece to Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, and then to Beijing, arriving 
on 31 March. From Beijing, the torch followed a route passing through every 
continent except Antarctica. The torch visited cities on the Silk Road, 
symbolizing ancient links between China and the rest of the world. A total 
of 21,880 torchbearers were selected from around the world by various organizations 
and entities.[55] The international portion of the relay was problematic. 
The month-long world tour encountered wide-scale anti-Chinese protests. 
After trouble in London involving attempts by protesters to put out the 
flame, the torch was extinguished in Paris the following day.[56] The American 
leg in San Francisco on 9 April was altered without prior warning to avoid 
such disturbances, although there were still demonstrations along the original 
route.[57] The relay was further delayed and simplified after the 2008 
Sichuan earthquake hit western China.[58] The flame was carried to the 
top of Mount Everest[55] on a 108 km (67 mi) long "highway" scaling the 
Tibetan side of the mountain, built especially for the relay. The $19.7 million 
blacktop project spanned from Tingri County of Xigazê Prefecture to the 
Everest Base Camp.[59] In March 2008, China banned mountaineers from climbing 
its side of Mount Everest, and later persuaded the Nepalese government 
to close their side as well, officially citing environmental concerns.[60] 
It also reflected concerns by the Chinese government that Tibet activists 
may try to disrupt its plans to carry the Olympic torch up the world's 
tallest peak.[61] The originally proposed route would have taken the torch 
through Taipei after leaving Vietnam and before heading for Hong Kong. 
However, the government of Taiwan (then led by the independence-leaning 
Democratic Progressive Party) objected to this proposal, claiming that 
this route would make the portion of the relay in Taiwan appear to be part 
of the torch's domestic journey through China, rather than a leg on the 
international route.[62] This dispute, as well as Chinese demands that 
the flag and the national anthem of the Republic of China be banned along 
the route led the government of Taiwan to reject the proposal that it be 
part of the relay route, and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait subsequently 
blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.[63] In the following 
calendar for the 2008 Olympic Games, each blue box represents an event 
competition, such as a qualification round, on that day. The yellow boxes 
represent days during which medal-awarding finals for a sport were held. 
Each bullet in these boxes is an event final, the number of bullets per 
box representing the number of finals that were contested on that day. 
On the left the calendar lists each sport with events held during the Games, 
and at the right how many gold medals were won in that sport. There is 
a key at the top of the calendar to aid the reader.[64] 125 Olympic records 
including 37 world records were set in various events at the Games. In 
swimming, sixty-five Olympic swimming records including 25 world records 
were broken due to the use of the LZR Racer, a specialized swimming suit 
developed by NASA and the Australian Institute of Sport.[65] Only two swimming 
Olympic records remained intact after the Games. The opening ceremony officially 
began at 8:00 pm China Standard Time (UTC+8) on 8 August 2008 in the Beijing 
National Stadium.[66] The number 8 is associated with prosperity and confidence 
in Chinese culture, and here it was a triple eight for the date and one 
extra for time (close to 08:08:08 pm).[67] The ceremony was co-directed 
by Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou and Chinese choreographer Zhang Jigang[68] 
and featured a cast of over 15,000 performers.[69] The ceremony lasted 
over four hours and was reported to have cost over US$100 million to produce.[70] 
A rich assembly of ancient Chinese art and culture dominated the ceremony. 
It opened with the beating of Fou drums for the countdown. Subsequently, 
a giant scroll was unveiled and became the show's centerpiece. The official 
song of the 2008 Olympics, titled "You and Me", was performed by Britain's 
Sarah Brightman and China's Liu Huan, on a large spinning rendition of 
the globe.[71] The last recipient in the Olympic Torch relay, former Chinese 
gymnast Li Ning ignited the cauldron, after being suspended into the air 
by wires and completing a lap of the National Stadium at roof height.[72] 
The opening ceremony was lauded by spectators and various international 
presses as "spectacular" and "spellbinding".[73] Hein Verbruggen, chairman 
of the IOC Coordination Commission for the XXIX Olympiad, called the ceremony 
"a grand, unprecedented success."[74] The program for the Beijing Games 
was quite similar to that of the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. There 
were 28 sports and 302 events at the 2008 Games. Nine new events were held, 
including two from the new cycling discipline of BMX. Women competed in 
the 3000 metre steeplechase for the first time. Open water swimming events 
for men and women, over the distance of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi), were added 
to the swimming discipline. Team events (men and women) in table tennis 
replaced the doubles events.[75] In fencing, women's team foil and women's 
team sabre replaced men's team foil and women's team épée.[d] Two sports 
were open only to men, baseball and boxing, while one sport and one discipline 
were open only to women, softball and synchronized swimming. Equestrian 
and mixed badminton are the only sports in which men and women compete 
together.[76][77] The following were the 302 events in 28 sports that were 
contested at the Games. The number of events contested in each sport is 
indicated in parentheses (in sports with more than one discipline, as identified 
by the IOC,[78] these are also specified). In addition to the official 
Olympic sports, the Beijing Organising Committee was given special dispensation 
by the IOC to run a wushu competition in parallel to the Games. The Wushu 
Tournament Beijing 2008 saw 128 athletes from 43 countries participate, 
with medals awarded in 15 separate events; however, these were not to be 
added to the official medal tally since Wushu was not on the programme 
of the 2008 Olympic Games.[79] The 2008 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony 
concluded the Beijing Games on 24 August 2008. It began at 8:00 pm China 
Standard Time (UTC+8), and took place at the Beijing National Stadium. 
The Ceremony included handover of the Games from Beijing to London. Guo 
Jinlong, the Mayor of Beijing handed over the Olympic flag to the Mayor 
of London Boris Johnson, followed by a performance organized by the London 
Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG). 
This presentation included performances by guitarist Jimmy Page, and recording 
artist Leona Lewis. Footballer David Beckham was also featured during London's 
presentation.[80] Eighty-seven nations earned medals, 54 of which won gold 
medals, both setting new records for Olympic Games.[81][82] 118 participating 
countries did not win a medal. Athletes from China won 51 gold medals, 
the most of any nation at these Olympics, becoming the first nation other 
than the United States and Russia (Soviet Union) to lead in medals since 
Germany at the 1936 Summer Olympics.[81] The United States team won the 
most medals overall, with 110.[82] Afghanistan,[83] Mauritius,[84] Sudan,[85] 
Tajikistan[86] and Togo[87] won their first Olympic medals. Athletes from 
Mongolia (which previously held the record for most medals without a gold)[88] 
and Panama[89] won their nation's first gold medals. An athlete from Serbia 
won its first medal under that name, having previously won medals as part 
of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro.[90] American swimmer Michael Phelps 
received a total of eight gold medals, more than any other Olympian in 
a single Olympic games, setting numerous world and Olympic records in the 
process.[81] Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt also set records in multiple 
events, completing the 100 m final with a time of 9.69 seconds, surpassing 
his own previous world record.[91] Russian-born American gymnast Nastia 
Liukin won the all-around gold medal in artistic gymnastics, becoming the 
third American woman to do so, following Mary Lou Retton in 1984 and Carly 
Patterson in 2004.[92] These are the top ten nations that won medals in 
the 2008 Games.[82]   *   Host nation (China) All but one of the 205 recognized 
National Olympic Committees (NOCs) that existed as of 2008[update] participated 
in the 2008 Summer Olympics, the exception being Brunei.[93] Three countries 
participated in the Olympic Games for their first time: the Marshall Islands, 
Montenegro and Tuvalu.[94] While not a full member recognized by the IOC 
and thus not allowed to compete formally in the Olympics, the Macau Sports 
and Olympic Committee sent a delegation to participate in the Wushu Tournament 
Beijing 2008, being the only unrecognized National Olympic Committee to 
have taken part in the 2008 Summer Olympics. It also coordinated efforts 
with the Chinese Olympic Committee to organize the torch relay through 
Macau. The Marshall Islands and Tuvalu gained National Olympic Committee 
status in 2006 and 2007 respectively, and 2008 was the first games in which 
they were eligible to participate.[95][96] The states of Serbia and Montenegro, 
which participated at the 2004 Games jointly as Serbia and Montenegro, 
competed separately for the first time. The Montenegrin Olympic Committee 
was accepted as a new National Olympic Committee in 2007.[96] Neighboring 
Kosovo, however, did not participate. After the declaration of independence 
in Kosovo, the IOC specified requirements that Kosovo needs to meet before 
being recognized by the IOC; most notably, it has to be recognized as independent 
by the United Nations.[97] China and the United States had the largest 
teams, with 639 athletes for China and 596 for the United States.[98][99] 
More than 100 sovereigns, heads of state and heads of government as well 
as 170 Ministers of Sport attended the Beijing Olympic Games.[100] Athletes 
from the Republic of China (Taiwan) competed at the 2008 Games as Chinese 
Taipei (TPE) under the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag and using the National 
Banner Song as their official anthem. The participation of Taiwan was briefly 
in doubt because of disagreements over the name of their team in the Chinese 
language and concerns about Taiwan marching in the Opening Ceremony next 
to the special administrative region of Hong Kong. A compromise on the 
naming was reached, and Taiwan was referred to during the games as "Chinese 
Taipei," rather than "Taipei, China," as the mainland China government 
had proposed. In addition, the Central African Republic was placed between 
Chinese Taipei and the Special Administrative Regions during the march 
of nations.[102] Starting in 2005, North Korea and South Korea held meetings 
to discuss the possibility of sending a united team to the 2008 Olympics.[103][104] 
The proposal failed, because of disagreements about how athletes would 
be chosen; North Korea was demanding a certain percentage representation 
for its athletes. A subsequent attempt to broker an agreement for the two 
nations to walk together during the March of Nations failed as well, despite 
their having done so during the 2000 and 2004 Games.[105] On 24 July 2008, 
the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned Iraq from competing in 
the 2008 Olympic Summer Games because of "political interference by the 
government in sports."[106][107] The IOC reversed its decision five days 
later and allowed the nation to compete after a pledge by Iraq to ensure 
"the independence of its national Olympics panel" by instituting fair elections 
before the end of November. In the meantime, Iraq's Olympic Organisation 
was run by "an interim committee proposed by its national sports federations 
and approved by the IOC."[108] Brunei Darussalam was due to take part in 
the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. However, they were disqualified on 8 August, 
having failed to register either of their two athletes.[109] The IOC spokeswoman 
Emmanuelle Moreau said in a statement that "it is a great shame and very 
sad for the athletes who lose out because of the decision by their team 
not to register them. The IOC tried up until the last minute, midday Friday 
August 8, 2008, the day of the official opening, to have them register, 
but to no avail."[110] Brunei's Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports issued 
a press release stating that their decision not to participate was due 
to an injury to one of their athletes.[111] Georgia announced on 9 August 
2008, that it was considering withdrawing from the Beijing Olympic Games 
because of the 2008 South Ossetia war, but it went on to compete while 
the conflict was still ongoing.[112] South African swimmer Natalie du Toit, 
whose left leg was amputated following a motor scooter accident, qualified 
to compete at the Beijing Olympics. The five time gold medalist at the 
Athens Paralympics in 2004 made history by becoming the first amputee to 
qualify for the Olympic Games since Olivér Halassy in 1936. She was able 
to compete in the Olympics rather than the Paralympics because she does 
not use a prosthetic leg while swimming.[113] Polish athlete Natalia Partyka, 
who was born without a right forearm, competed in Table Tennis in both 
the 2008 Olympic Games and 2008 Paralympic Games.[114] A variety of concerns 
over the Games, or China's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by 
various entities, including allegations that China violated its pledge 
to allow open media access,[115] various alleged human rights violations,[116][117] 
its continuous support of repressive regimes (such as Zimbabwe, Burma, 
Sudan and North Korea), air pollution in both the city of Beijing and in 
neighbouring areas,[118] proposed boycotts,[119][120] warnings of the possibility 
that the Beijing Olympics could be targeted by terrorist groups,[121] disruption 
from pro-Tibetan protesters,[122] and religious persecutions.[123] There 
were also reports that several members of China's women's gymnastics team, 
including double gold medal winner He Kexin, were too young to compete 
under the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique's rules for Olympic 
eligibility, but all were exonerated after an official IOC investigation.[124][125][126] 
In the lead-up to the Olympics, the government allegedly issued guidelines 
to the local media for their reporting during the Games: most political 
issues not directly related to the games were to be downplayed; topics 
such as pro-Tibetan independence and East Turkestan movements were not 
to be reported on, as were food safety issues such as "cancer-causing mineral 
water."[127] As the 2008 Chinese milk scandal broke in September 2008, 
there was widespread speculation that China's desire for a perfect Games 
may have been a factor contributing towards the delayed recall of contaminated 
infant formula.[128][129] The 2008 Olympic Games have been generally accepted 
by the world's media as a logistical success.[130][131] Many of the worst 
fears about the games failed to materialize: no terrorists struck Beijing; 
no athlete protested at the podium (though Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian 
tossed his bronze medal in disgust over judging), and the air quality – 
due largely to favorable weather patterns – was not as bad as many had 
feared beforehand despite being the worst in Olympics history.[132][133] 
Hopes that hosting the Games would lead to improvements in human rights 
protections and rule of law in China, however, went unfulfilled.[134] Many 
in China viewed the Olympics as "an affirmation of a single nationalistic 
dream" and saw protests during the international torch relay as an insult 
to China.[135] The Games also bolstered domestic support for the Chinese 
government, and for the policies of the Communist Party, giving rise to 
concerns that the Olympics would give the state more leverage to suppress 
political dissent, at least temporarily.[136] Efforts to quell any unrest 
before and during the Games also contributed to a rapid expansion in the
