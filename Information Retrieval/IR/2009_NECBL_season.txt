The 2009 NECBL season is the 16th season of the New England Collegiate 
Baseball League, a wood bat collegiate summer baseball league. The league's 
Torrington, Connecticut franchise, the Torrington Twisters, moved to New 
Bedford, Massachusetts and became the New Bedford Bay Sox.[2] Due to the 
move, the League realigned into the East and West Divisions with 6 teams 
each.[3] In the championship series, the East Division champion Newport 
Gulls defeated the West Division champion Vermont Mountaineers after each 
team advanced through the playoffs.[1] [4] The NECBL's 2009 All-Star Game 
was hosted by the West Division's Holyoke Blue Sox. The event was held 
at Mackenzie Stadium in Holyoke, Massachusetts on July 18, 2009. The West 
Division won the game 6-5. The game was attended by 4,906, setting a new 
record for All-Star Game attendance. Holyoke's Jake Rosenbeck was named 
the game's MVP.[5] Eight teams qualified for the 2009 NECBL playoffs, which 
consisted of three rounds of best-of-three series. In the championship 
series, East Division champion Newport defeated West Division champion 
Vermont 2-1. [6] [8] The following is a list of the NECBL's top 10 professional 
prospects for the 2009 season, as ranked by Baseball America.[9] The Newport 
Gulls led the league in attendance for the fourth consecutive season, while 
the Lowell All-Americans finished last in the league for the fifth straight 
year. New Bedford, Danbury, and Newport showed the greatest increase in 
average attendance, while Keene and Vermont showed the greatest decrease. 
The top 6 teams in attendance also ranked in the top 50 in national collegiate 
summer league attendance. The Newport Gulls were ranked third, with the 
Vermont Mountaineers (24th), Keene Swamp Bats (26th), Holyoke Blue Sox 
(32nd), New Bedford Bay Sox (42nd), and North Adams SteepleCats (45th)
