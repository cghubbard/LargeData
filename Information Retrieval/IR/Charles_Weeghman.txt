Charles H. ("Lucky Charlie") Weeghman (March 12, 1874 – November 1, 1938) 
was one of the founders of the short-lived major league baseball organization 
called the Federal League (1914–1915). He had made a fortune in an early 
type of fast-food franchises in the Chicago area.[5] Weeghman worked for 
Charlie King as a waiter for $10 a week. King quickly promoted Weeghman 
who eventually open his own lunch counter in Chicago.[6] King, who would 
have been Weeghman's main rival, died the day Weeghman's first restaurant 
opened.[7] Serving only cold sandwiches, his diners would eat at one-armed 
school tables so Weeghman could fit more chairs into the restaurant.[1] 
At one point, Weeghman owned fifteen of these diners, with the one located 
at Madison and Dearborn serving 35,000 people each day.[6] His net worth 
was estimated at $8,000,000.[4] In 1911, Weeghman made an unsuccessful 
attempt to purchase a controlling interest in the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Cardinals owner Helene Hathaway Britton had recently inherited the team 
upon the death of her uncle, Stanley Robison, but she refused Weeghman's 
offer of $350,000 for the club, eventually selling the team to Sam Breadon 
in 1917.[8] Weeghman founded the Chicago Whales and built a new steel-and-concrete 
ballpark, Weeghman Park, for them to play in. He leased the land, the former 
site of the Theological Seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, from 
Edward Archambault, for 99 years at a cost of $16,000 per year. Weeghman's 
lease forbade the use of the land for "immoral or illegal purposes."[6] 
Weeghman chose the site, in part, because of the proximity of the 'L' tracks.[6] 
After the Federal League folded, Weeghman merged the Whales with the Chicago 
Cubs, emerging as the older club's majority owner. He then moved the Cubs 
from wooden West Side Park to Weeghman Park. His lunch counter chain lost 
favor with the public, and Weeghman was forced to sell more and more of 
his stock in the Cubs to chewing gum magnate William Wrigley, Jr. to raise 
money. By 1918, Weeghman had sold his remaining stake to Wrigley, and was 
out of the picture altogether. The Wrigley family would control the Cubs 
for the next six decades before selling out to the Tribune Company. This 
also led to the name change from Weeghman Park to Cubs Park, and later, 
Wrigley Field. Weeghman also lost control of his restaurant business, with 
his brother, Albert, taking over.[9] Following his losses, Weeghman moved 
to New York, where he unsuccessfully tried to start over in the restaurant 
business.[4] On August 16, 1921, Weeghman sponsored the first statewide 
rally of the Ku Klux Klan on his property in Lake Zurich, Illinois. The 
rally may have drawn more than 12,000 people and saw the initiation of 
more than 2,000 new Klan members.[4][10] Weeghman met his first wife, Bessie 
Webb, when she worked at his first lunch room as a cashier. In 1913, they 
had a daughter, Dorothy.[11] Weeghman's wife filed for divorce on February 
27, 1920, claiming Weeghman had been intimate with at least one other woman.[5] 
In 1922, two years after he divorced his first wife, Weeghman eloped to 
East St. Louis with Carol Osmund, who was 29 years old at the time of their 
wedding.[12] Osmund and Weeghman remained married until he suffered a fatal
