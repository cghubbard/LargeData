James Clancy (born December 18, 1955) is a former starting pitcher in Major 
League Baseball who played for the Toronto Blue Jays (1977–88), Houston 
Astros (1989–91) and Atlanta Braves (1991). He batted and threw right-handed. 
Clancy attended St. Rita of Cascia High School on the south side of Chicago 
and was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the fourth round of the 1974 MLB 
Draft. Clancy played rookie level baseball with the Rangers Gulf Coast 
League team, where he had a record of 3-3 with a 2.72 ERA in nine starts. 
The Rangers moved Clancy up to the Anderson Rangers of the Western Carolinas 
League for the 1975 season, however, despite a respectable ERA of 3.83 
in 23 starts, Clancy had a poor 6-13 record. Texas moved Clancy up to the 
San Antonio Brewers of the Texas League in 1976, however, he had a rough 
season, posting a record of 6-8 with a 6.41 in 23 starts. He was left unprotected 
in the 1976 MLB Expansion Draft, and was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays 
with the sixth pick. Clancy began his Blue Jays career playing with the 
Cleveland Indians AA affiliate, the Jersey City Indians of the Eastern 
League. Despite having a poor season with the team, where he had a 5-13 
record and 4.88 ERA in 20 starts, the Blue Jays called him up to the Major 
League level. Clancy made his MLB debut on July 26, 1977, against the Texas 
Rangers at Exhibition Stadium. Clancy started the game, however, he lasted 
only two innings, allowing five runs as the Rangers routed Toronto 14-0. 
Clancy earned his first major league victory in his next start, pitching 
a complete game, allowing seven hits and one earned run as Toronto defeated 
the Milwaukee Brewers 3-2. Clancy would finish the year with a 4-9 record 
with a 5.05 ERA. In 1978, Clancy spent his first full season with the Blue 
Jays, earning a 10-12 record with a 4.09 ERA in 31 games. He had an injury 
plagued season in 1979, where he had a 2-7 record and a 5.51 ERA in 12 
games. Clancy had a very solid season in 1980, as he had a 13-16 record 
with a 3.30 ERA and 15 complete games, before struggling in the 1981 season, 
as Clancy had a 6-12 record with a 4.90 ERA. In 1982, Clancy posted his 
first winning season, as he had a 16-14 record, starting a league high 
40 games, and appearing in the 1982 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, 
where he pitched a perfect fourth inning. Clancy had another very solid 
season in 1983, compiling a record of 15-11 with a 3.91 ERA, as the Blue 
Jays had their first ever winning season. Clancy struggled in 1984, as 
he had a losing record for the first time in three seasons, with a 13-15 
record, and a 4.64 ERA in a league high 36 starts. He led the league in 
earned runs allowed with 125. The 1985 season would be injury plagued, 
however, Clancy pitched effectively, earning a 9-6 record and a 3.78 ERA 
as Toronto made the post-season for the first time in team history. The 
injured Clancy pitched in only one inning in the 1985 ALCS as Toronto lost 
to the Kansas City Royals in seven games. He had a disappointing 1986 season, 
as Clancy posted a 14-14 record with a 3.94 ERA, followed by a strong year 
in 1987, in which he had a 15-11 record and a 3.54 ERA as the Blue Jays 
failed to qualify for the playoffs in both years. Clancy spent his final 
season with Toronto in 1988, where he struggled with a record of 11-13 
and a 4.49 ERA, as the Jays once again missed the playoffs. Clancy became 
a free agent after the 1988 season, and signed a contract with the Houston 
Astros. He made his Astros debut on April 8, 1989, pitching 8.1 innings 
and allowing two runs in a 6-2 win over the San Diego Padres at The Astrodome. 
He would struggle as the season went along, sporting a record of 7-14 with 
a 5.08 ERA as the Astros finished in third place in the National League 
West. Clancy split time between starting and working out of the bullpen 
in 1990, where he struggled with a 2-8 record and a 6.51 ERA, and had a 
stint with the Tucson Toros, the Astros AAA affiliate in the Pacific Coast 
League. In 1991, Clancy spent the season working out of the bullpen, and 
despite a 0-3 record, he was effective, as he had a 2.78 ERA in 30 games 
and earned five saves. On July 31, 1991, Clancy was traded to the Atlanta 
Braves for Matt Turner.[1] Clancy appeared in 24 games with the Atlanta 
Braves, all out of the bullpen, as he posted a 3-2 record with a 5.71 ERA, 
helping Atlanta win the National League West division. In the 1991 NLCS, 
Clancy made only one appearance, getting the only batter out that he faced 
as the Braves defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates to earn a spot in the World 
Series. Clancy pitched in three games during the 1991 World Series, and 
earned his first ever post-season victory in the third game of the series 
as Atlanta defeated the Minnesota Twins 5-4 in twelve innings. Clancy finished 
the series with a 1-0 record with a 4.15 ERA, but the Twins won the series 
in seven games. Clancy once again became a free agent after the season, 
and signed a minor league deal with the Chicago Cubs, but he retired during
