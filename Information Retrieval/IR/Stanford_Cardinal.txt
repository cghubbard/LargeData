The Stanford Cardinal is the nickname of the 36 varsity athletic teams 
at Stanford University. Stanford's program has won over 100 national team 
championships. Stanford has won 21 consecutive NACDA Directors' Cups, awarded 
annually to the most successful overall college sports program in the nation. 
Stanford's teams compete in the Pac-12 Conference, along with other schools 
from the western third of the United States. Following its win over Cal 
in the first-ever Big Game in 1892, the color cardinal was picked as the 
primary color of Stanford's athletic teams. White was adopted as a secondary 
color in the 1940s. On November 25, 1930, following a unanimous vote by 
the Executive Committee for the Associated Students, the athletic department 
adopted the mascot "Indian." The Indian symbol and name were later dropped 
by President Richard Lyman in 1972, after objections from Native American 
students and a vote by the student senate.[2] From 1972 to 1981, the official 
nickname was the Cardinals, a reference to the color, not the bird.[2][3] 
During the 1970s, a number of suggestions were put forth as possible nicknames: 
Robber Barons (a sly reference to Leland Stanford's history), Sequoias, 
Trees, Railroaders, Spikes, Huns and Griffins. The last suggestion gained 
enough momentum to prompt the university to place two griffin statues near 
the athletic facilities.[2][3] On November 17, 1981, school president Donald 
Kennedy declared that the athletic teams be represented by the color cardinal 
in its singular form.[2] Stanford has no official mascot, but the Stanford 
Tree, a member of the Stanford Band wearing a self-designed tree costume, 
appears at major Stanford sports events. The Tree is based upon El Palo 
Alto, a redwood tree in neighboring Palo Alto that appears in the Stanford 
seal and athletics logo. Stanford University sponsors varsity teams in 
15 men's, 20 women's, and two coed sports. All are NCAA sponsored sports 
unless indicated:[4] Men's Intercollegiate Sports Women's Intercollegiate 
Sports Coed Intercollegiate Sports Stanford has won 109 NCAA team national 
championships.[5] Stanford has won these NCAA team championships in 20 
different sports. Below are 35 national team titles in NCAA sports that 
were not bestowed by the NCAA: Below are 41 national team titles won by 
Stanford varsity and club sports teams at the highest collegiate levels 
in non-NCAA sports: Stanford has won at least one NCAA team championship 
each year for 40 consecutive years, starting in 1976-77 and continuing 
through 2015-16.[10] Stanford's run of 40 consecutive years winning an 
NCAA team championship is the longest such streak in NCAA history. The 
next longest NCAA championship streak is 19 years. Stanford has won 95 
NCAA team championships during this 40 year NCAA championship streak. The 
most NCAA team championships Stanford has won in a single year is six in 
1996-97 (men's and women's cross-country, men's and women's tennis, and 
men's and women's volleyball). Stanford has won five NCAA team championships 
in a year three times (1991–92, 1994–95, and 1997–98). Stanford athletes 
have won 476 NCAA individual championships as of July 1, 2015.[11] Stanford's 
476 individual championships are the most individual championships won 
by any school in NCAA Division I. No other Division I school has won more 
than 389 NCAA individual championships. Stanford has won the NACDA Directors' 
Cup every year for the last 21 years. The Directors' Cup recognizes the 
most successful overall sports program in NCAA Division I.[12] The Directors' 
Cup is awarded annually by the National Association of Collegiate Directors 
of Athletics (NACDA). The Directors' Cup rewards broad-based success in 
both men's and women's college sports. Points are awarded based on post-season 
success in NCAA-sponsored sports.[13] Stanford finished second in the first 
Directors' Cup competition in 1993-94, behind North Carolina. Stanford 
won its first Directors' Cup the following year, 1994-95. Stanford has 
won the Directors' Cup every year since then, winning 21 Directors' Cups 
in a row from 1994-95 through 2014-15.[14] The Cardinal have appeared in 
the NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament 31 times, and appearing in the 
College World Series 16 times. They have won two National Championships, 
in 1987 and 1988. The men's golf team has won eight NCAA Championships: 
1938,[15] 1939, 1941, 1942 (co-champions), 1946, 1953, 1994, 2007. They 
have crowned three individual national champions: Sandy Tatum in 1942, 
Tiger Woods in 1996, and Cameron Wilson in 2014. They have won 10 Pac-12 
Conference championships: 1960, 1968, 1970, 1974, 1977 (south), 1992, 1994, 
2014–16.[16] The Cardinal have appeared in the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer 
Tournament 13 times since their inaugural season in 1973, including 10 
times in the 19 seasons from 1997–2015. They have four appearances in the 
College Cup, including winning the 2015 national championship. The Cardinal 
have won 18 NCAA tennis championships: 1982, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 
1990, 1991, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2010, 2013, and 2016.[17][18] 
Stanford is one of only two teams, along with Penn State, that has appeared 
in every NCAA tournament since its inception in 1981. Stanford has won 
6 NCAA championships, second only to Penn State, and has appeared in 14 
championship games, more than any other team.[19][20][21] The Stanford 
Wrestling team is coached by Jason Borrelli. Borrelli wrestled at Central 
Michigan University. Currently in his sixth season, Borrelli has compiled 
a 42-53-3 career record. The Cardinal wrestlers practice in the Weintz 
Family Wrestling Room, and compete on campus at Burnham Pavilion, with 
a capacity of about 1,400.[22] The Cardinal Wrestling team have placed 
in the top 20 at the NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships in 1967 (13th), 
2004 (19th), 2008 (19th), 2011 (11th), and 2012 (16th). The team finished 
third in the Pacific Coast Conference placings in 1933 and 1935, second 
in the AAWU in 1965, third in the Pacific-10 Conference in 1985 and 1986 
second in the Pac-10 in 2008, and third in the Pac-12 in 2012.[23] Stanford 
has one national champion in its history: Matt Gentry at 157 pounds in 
2004. Through 2015, the Cardinal can claim 21 conference champions and 
17 All-Americans, but no team Pac-12 titles. Stanford has fielded a college 
rugby team since 1906, and replaced football entirely until 1917. Stanford 
achieved one of the most surprising victories of American rugby's early 
history by beating a touring Australian club team in 1912.[24] Rugby remained 
a varsity sport at Stanford until 1977.[25] Despite the loss of varsity 
status, the Stanford Rugby Foundation covers many of the team's expenses 
from an endowment fund. Rugby is one of the largest sports programs on 
campus with over 100 players.[25] Stanford Rugby is led by Director of 
Rugby Matt Sherman, who has served as an assistant coach for the U.S. men's 
national team.[26] From 1996 to 1998 Stanford reached the national semifinals 
in three consecutive years, finishing second in 1998.[27] During the 2010–11 
season, Stanford was champion of the Northern California conference, reached 
the national quarterfinals, and finished the season ranked 4th in D1-AA 
rugby.[28] Following the 2011–12 season, Stanford were promoted to Division 
1-A and played in the California conference, but have since returned to 
Division 1-AA and now play in the Pacific Western conference. Stanford 
won the Pacific Western conference in 2014, earning a berth in the D1-AA 
national playoffs, where they defeated Oregon 24–12 at home in front of 
a strong crowd,[29] before losing to Arizona 27–24 in the quarterfinals. 
Stanford has a traditional sports rivalry in the San Francisco Bay Area 
with the University of California, Berkeley. Stanford athletes have traditionally 
been very well represented at the Olympics.[30] In the 2008 Beijing Olympics, 
Stanford sent 47 current or former student athletes, 32 of whom competed 
for the United States, 14 for other countries, and one as a coach for the 
United States softball team.[31] In all, Stanford athletes won 25 medals:[32] 
For the 2012 London Olympics, 39 athletes were from Stanford and 26 represented 
Team USA.[33] The Stanford Athletic Hall of Fame was established on December 
21, 1954. The brainchild of Walt Gamage, sports editor of the now-defunct 
Palo Alto Times, the first class of inductees consisted of 34 Stanford 
sports greats. New members are inducted annually and are recognized during 
halftime of a home Stanford football game. The Stanford Athletic Hall of 
Fame Room is located on the first floor of the Arrillaga Family Sports
