As Player As Manager John Joseph "Jack" Barry (April 26, 1887 – April 23, 
1961) was an American shortstop, second baseman, and manager in Major League 
Baseball, and later a college baseball coach. From 1908 through 1919, Barry 
played for the Philadelphia Athletics (1908–15) and Boston Red Sox (1915–19). 
Born in Meriden, Connecticut, Barry spent his nearly entire tenure in the 
big leagues on winning teams, first the Philadelphia Athletics and later 
the Boston Red Sox. Athletics manager Connie Mack signed Barry off the 
campus of the College of the Holy Cross to play shortstop on what would 
become his famous $100,000 infield. The unit, one of the most famous groups 
of teammates in baseball history, consisted of first baseman Stuffy McInnis, 
second baseman Eddie Collins, and third baseman Frank Baker. The group, 
which represented an enormous financial investment at the time, was critical 
to the Athletics winning the American League pennant in 1910, 1911, 1913 
and 1914, and World Championships in 1910, 1911, and 1913. In 1915, the 
year after the Boston Braves swept the Athletics in the World Series, Red 
Sox owner Joe Lannin paid $8,000 for Barry's services, as Mack was dismantling 
the team. Upon joining the Red Sox, he hit just .262 but played reliable 
defense at shortstop, proving to be the last piece of the puzzle in what 
was to be another pennant-winning team. He played in the World Series in 
1915 and 1916 for the Red Sox. Acknowledged as the team's on-field leader, 
he became a player-manager in 1917, leading the team to a 90-win season 
and a second-place finish to the Chicago White Sox. In the war year of 
1917, manager Jack Barry chose to enlist and on October 18, 1917 Jack and 
four other Red Sox players, who had enlisted as yeomen in the naval reserve, 
were called to active duty and ordered to report for duty on November 3, 
1917. He served all of 1918 in the military. After poor play in 1919, he 
decided to retire rather than be sold away in another fire sale following 
Harry Frazee's decision to sell his shortstop back to the Athletics. In 
an 11-season career, Barry posted a .243 batting average with 10 home runs 
and 429 RBI in 1223 games. Barry became the head coach at Holy Cross in 
1921, and continued in that position for 40 years until his death in Shrewsbury, 
Massachusetts at age 73. During his tenure, he posted the highest career 
winning percentage (.806) in collegiate history, and won the 1952 College 
World Series. He was among the initial class of inductees to the American 
Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1966. In 2007 he was an inaugural 
veteran inductee of the College Baseball Hall of Fame along with Lou Gehrig,
