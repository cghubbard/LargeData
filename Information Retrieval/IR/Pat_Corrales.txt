As Player As Manager Patrick Corrales (born March 20, 1941 in Los Angeles, 
California), is a former catcher and manager in Major League Baseball who 
played from 1964 to 1973, primarily for the Cincinnati Reds and also for 
the Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals and San Diego Padres. Corrales 
was a baseball and football star at Fresno High School in Fresno, California 
and a teammate of future major-league pitchers Jim Maloney and Dick Ellsworth. 
An offensive guard and linebacker, he was named lineman of the year by 
the Fresno Bee. After high school he signed as an amateur free agent with 
the Phillies in 1959.[1] He made his major league playing debut at age 
23 on August 2, 1964 with the Phillies. He pinch-hit for pitcher John Boozer 
in the fifth inning, grounding out against the Los Angeles Dodgers' Larry 
Miller in a 6-1 Phillies loss at Connie Mack Stadium.[2] His first career 
hit came the next year on June 15, 1965 in a 12-7 Phillies loss to the 
Milwaukee Braves at County Stadium when he singled in the eighth inning 
off Tony Cloninger and later scored.[3] He had one of his best career games 
the next day when, in a 6-2 Phillies win over the Braves, he started at 
catcher and went 3-4 with his first major league home run (a two-run shot 
in the third inning against Denny Lemaster).[4] In a nine-year playing 
career as a backup catcher (including to Baseball Hall of Famer Johnny 
Bench), Corrales played in 300 games with 166 hits, four home runs, 54 
runs batted in and a .216 batting average. He appeared in one game of the 
1970 World Series for the Reds and batted once, grounding out for the final 
out of the series as the Reds fell in five games to the Baltimore Orioles.[1] 
Corrales spent nine years as a major league manager and finished with an 
overall record of 572–634[5] with the Texas Rangers, Phillies and Cleveland 
Indians. Corrales managed in both the National League and American League, 
and became only the fourth manager to manage in both leagues in the same 
season. He is the only manager ever to be fired while in first place—the 
Phillies fired him in 1983 when the team had a record of 43–42[6]), and 
he was replaced by Paul Owens. Corrales is also the first major league 
manager of Mexican American descent.[7] After being fired in 1987 as manager 
of the Indians[8] he has had a long career as a bench coach. He was in 
that role for nine years with the Atlanta Braves, and was with Washington 
Nationals for the 2007 and 2008 seasons before being fired at the end of 
2008 along with the majority of the Nationals' coaching staff. Shortly 
after being fired, he accepted a job as a special consultant to the Nationals. 
He resumed as bench coach in July 2009 after Jim Riggleman was appointed 
acting manager after Manny Acta was fired. Corrales was once again appointed 
Nats bench coach in June, 2011 by new manager Davey Johnson. Corrales replaced 
John McLaren, who had been reassigned to scouting duty.[9] On November 
5, 2012, Corrales was hired by the Los Angeles Dodgers as a special assistant 
to the General Manager. Pat Corrales' wife died just hours after giving 
birth to the couple's fourth child in July, 1969. She had developed a blood 
clot in her lung and died seven hours after giving birth.[10] He was inducted
