Clifford Earl Torgeson (January 1, 1924 – November 8, 1990) was an American 
Major League Baseball player from Snohomish, Washington. A first baseman, 
he played on five teams for 15 years, from 1947 through 1961. He was known 
by his middle name, Earl, and his nickname was the "The Earl of Snohomish", 
a nickname originally owned by baseball hall of famer, Earl Averill, also 
from Torgeson's hometown. In 1950, Torgeson led the National League (NL) 
with 120 runs scored and in 1957, he led the American League (AL) with 
a .999 fielding average as first baseman. Earl Torgeson was born in the 
lumber town of Snohomish, Washington on New Years Day of 1924. He served 
in the U.S. Army during World War II from 1943 to 1945. After the war, 
he played for Seattle in the Pacific Coast League. Torgeson's had a lifetime 
.265 batting average and .989 fielding average. His best batting average 
for a full season was .290 and his highest home run total was 24. His career 
on-base percentage was .385 (the league average for the years he played 
is .339) and in 1950, when he led the National League with 120 runs scored, 
his on-base percentage was .412. Most years that he played over 100 games, 
he was in the league's top 10 for drawing base on balls (walks). His peak 
years for drawing walks were 1950 and 1951, when he drew 119 and 102 walks 
respectively. In 1959, he helped the White Sox win the American League 
Pennant. In one game in 1959, during an inning against Kansas City where 
the White Sox scored 11 runs on one hit, he got a pinch-hit walk. In 1950, 
the only two National League regulars at first base to outpace him in home 
run totals were Ted Kluszewski, with 25 home runs, and Gil Hodges, with 
32 home runs. Torgeson's 23 home runs that year were far ahead of the other 
first basemen in the league. Eddie Waitkus of league champion Philadelphia 
had 2; Tookie Gilbert of New York had 4; Preston Ward of Chicago had 6; 
Johnny Hopp of Pittsburgh had 8; and Rocky Nelson of St. Louis had only 
1. Torgeson was a regular player for 9 years, and he would have been a 
regular in 1949 if not for a shoulder injury in May and broken thumb in 
August 1949 (also a broken rib when hit by a pitch in 1950). He played 
another five years as a role player. As a pinch hitter, as per earlier 
in his career, his batting eye was key to his value. Even when his hits 
were few, he still got on base. In 1961, for example, playing out the string 
for the New York Yankees, he hit only .111 in 18 at-bats, but drew 8 walks 
for a .385 on-base percentage. Torgeson also deserves some mention for 
his base stealing. Although his highest total for a baseball season was 
only 20, it came during a period in baseball when almost no one stole bases, 
especially not first basemen. For the short period (1950–-1952) that they 
had Sam Jethroe (who won bases stealing crowns in 1950 and 1951) and Torgeson, 
the Braves had the best base stealing tandem in baseball. In 1950, with 
a combined total of 50 stolen bases, the Jethroe-Torgeson duo stole more 
bases than every other team in the National League, except for the Brooklyn
