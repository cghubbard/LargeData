Joseph Wheeler Sewell (October 9, 1898 – March 6, 1990) was a Major League 
Baseball infielder for the Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees. He was 
elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977.[1] Sewell holds the record 
for the lowest strikeout rate in major league history, striking out on 
average only once every 63 at-bats,[2] and the most consecutive games without 
a strikeout, at 115. Born in Titus, Alabama, Sewell lettered in college 
football at the University of Alabama in 1917, 1918, and 1919.[3] He led 
the school baseball team to four conference titles before joining the minor 
league New Orleans Pelicans in 1920, where he played a partial season before 
being called up to the "big league".[4] Sewell made his major league debut 
mid-season in 1920 with the World Series champion Cleveland Indians shortly 
after shortstop Ray Chapman was killed by a pitch from the Yankees’ Carl 
Mays in August and became the team's full-time shortstop the following 
year.[1] An emerging star, Sewell batted .318 with 101 runs, 93 RBI and 
a .412 on-base percentage in 1921.[5] Sewell's patience and daily work 
ethic became his hallmarks over the following decade and a half. Playing 
with Cleveland until 1930 and the New York Yankees from 1931 to 1933, Sewell 
batted .312 with 1,141 runs, 1,055 RBI, 49 home runs and a .391 on-base 
percentage. He regularly scored 90 or more runs a season and twice topped 
the 100 RBI plateau. He hit a career high 11 home runs in 1932.[5] Of more 
historical significance, Sewell struck out a mere 114 times in 7,132 career 
at-bats for an average of one strikeout every 62.5 at-bats, second only 
to Willie Keeler (63.1). He also holds the single-season record for fewest 
strikeouts over a full season, with 3, set in 1932. Sewell also had 3 strikeouts 
in 1930, albeit in just 353 at-bats (as opposed to 503 in his record-setting 
year), as well as three other full seasons (1925, 1929, 1933) with 4 strikeouts. 
He struck out ten or more times in only four seasons, and his highest strikeout 
total was twenty, during the 1922 season. For his 1925–1933 seasons, Sewell 
struck out 4, 6, 7, 9, 4, 3, 8, 3, and 4 times. He also holds the record 
for consecutive games without recording a strikeout, at 115. Sewell also 
played in 1,103 consecutive games, which to that point was second only 
to Everett Scott. His 167.7 at-bats per strikeout in 1932 remains a Major 
League Single Season record. According to his obituary published in the 
New York Times, he played his entire Major League career using only one 
bat (a 40-ouncer he dubbed "Black Betsy."),[1] which he kept in shape by 
rubbing with a Coke bottle and seasoning with chewing tobacco.[4] Sewell 
played in two World Series, in 1920 and 1932, winning both times. His 1977 
induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame was by the Veteran's Committee. 
In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 
100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. (He joined the Indians' roster 
after September 1 in 1920 and normally would not have been eligible to 
participate in post-season play, but Wilbert Robinson, manager of the Brooklyn 
Robins, waived the rule because of the circumstances with Chapman.) Two 
of his brothers, Luke Sewell and Tommy Sewell, also played major league 
baseball.Tommy played in one game with the Chicago Cubs in 1927, and Luke 
played for four teams over 20 years and, as manager of the St. Louis Browns, 
led the team to its only pennant in 1944. [4] His cousin Rip Sewell was 
a major league pitcher credited with inventing the eephus pitch. Joe Sewell 
was a member of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. Sewell-Thomas Stadium, the baseball 
stadium at the University of Alabama, is named in his honor and is nicknamed 
by Crimson Tide fans as "The Joe".[6] After his retirement, Mr. Sewell 
worked as a public relations man for a dairy and was a major league scout.[4] 
In 1964, at the age of 66, he became the Alabama baseball coach, achieving 
a 114-99 record in seven seasons.[4] One of his pitchers was future NFL 
standout, Alabama quarterback and 1966 MLB 10th round draftee (Yankees) 
Ken "The Snake" Stabler.[7] Posthumously, Joe Sewell's community (Elmore 
County) has established a scholarship award recognizing local high school 
seniors who exhibit Christian character, leadership in their community, 
strong academic standing, and athletic achievements. Joe Sewell graduated 
from Wetumpka High School in 1916.[6] Pound sign (#) denotes interim head
