John Steadman (February 14, 1927 – January 1, 2001) was an American sportswriter 
for The Baltimore Sun. His career spanned 7 decades and he attended and

would regain an NFL franchise. Steadman would attend every Baltimore Football

one of only eight writers to attend all 34 Super Bowls, through Super Bowl 
XXXIV. He was inducted into the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters 
Association Hall of Fame in 2000. Steadman served as a color commentator 
on Colts radio broadcasts from 1955–58 and again from 1963-66. In 1959
