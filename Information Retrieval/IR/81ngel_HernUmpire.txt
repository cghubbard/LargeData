Ángel Hernández (born August 26, 1961) is an umpire for Major League Baseball. 
He worked in the National League from 1991 to 1999, and has worked throughout 
Major League Baseball since 2000. Hernández has umpired in the World Series 
in 2002 and 2005, as well as the All-Star Game in 1999 and 2009. He has 
officiated in six League Championship Series – two in each league (2000, 
2001, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2010), and in eight League Division Series (1997, 
1998, 2002, 2005, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2015). Hernandez also worked Game 7 
of the 2008 ALCS as an injury fill-in for Derryl Cousins. Hernández wears 
the uniform number 55 (He wore number 5 while in the National League, but 
the number was taken by Dale Scott when the umpires were consolidated under 
MLB in 2000).[1] In a 1999 Major League Baseball Players Association survey, 
Hernández was ranked 31st out of 36 National League umpires.[2] However, 
later that year, Hernández was asked to return for the 2000 season while 
13 of his NL colleagues were let go. Given his ranking, the Philadelphia 
Inquirer termed the retention of Hernández one of the "surprises" of the 
1999 purge.[3] Hernández has been involved in several incidents with players. 
On August 7, 2001, he ejected a guest singer of "Take Me Out to the Ball 
Game" at Wrigley Field. The ejectee was former Chicago Bears player Steve 
McMichael, who had taken a shot at Hernandez's umpiring over the PA system 
after being introduced as the guest singer.[4] On July 17, 2006, Hernández 
was the third base umpire and ejected Dodgers' first base coach Mariano 
Duncan. When Duncan came out of the dugout to argue the ejection, he tossed 
his cap onto the ground in anger. Immediately after his peers brought Duncan 
back into the dugout, Hernández picked up the cap and tossed it to a fan 
in the stands.[5] The next day, Duncan taped his cap to his head before 
delivering the Dodgers' lineup to the umpires.[6] A 2006 Sports Illustrated 
poll of Major League players listed Hernandez as the third worst umpire 
in MLB.[7] Hernández has had multiple confrontations with infielder Julio 
Lugo. In April 2007, Lugo attempted to call timeout and stepped out of 
the batter's box as the pitcher went into his windup, and Hernández called 
the resulting pitch a strike.[a] This began an argument between Lugo and 
Hernández, but did not result in any ejection. On May 27, 2008, Lugo was 
among multiple Red Sox who asked for a check swing ruling from Hernández, 
though as the third base umpire, he was unable to provide a ruling unless 
requested by the home plate umpire. A confrontation ensued, resulting in 
Lugo's ejection from the game. Hernández subsequently ejected Red Sox manager 
Terry Francona when the latter came out to argue Lugo's ejection.[9] On 
June 1, 2010, Hernández ejected Joe Maddon after the latter argued a Carlos 
Peña request for "Time" that was not granted pursuant to the aforementioned 
Rule 6.02(b) prohibiting late requests for "Time," resulting in a ninth 
inning strikeout.[10] For the second half of the 2011 baseball season, 
Hernández was moved from the umpiring crew of Joe West to the crew of Gerry 
Davis.[11] On May 8, 2013, Hernández served as the crew chief when regular 
crew chief Dana DeMuth was not with the umpiring crew for a series in Cleveland 
between the Oakland Athletics and the Cleveland Indians. In the ninth inning, 
Athletics' second baseman Adam Rosales hit a ball over the yellow home 
run line in left center field. The initial ruling was that it stayed in 
play. After video review, Hernández ruled it a double.[12] Video replays 
clearly showed the ball hitting a railing in the bleachers above the yellow 
line, which serves as a divider between home runs and balls still in play. 
A's manager Bob Melvin argued the call and Hernández ejected him from the 
game. The call cost the Athletics the game; they lost to the Cleveland 
Indians, 4-3.[13] Athletics players, fans, and sports columnists criticized 
Hernández in the wake of the call. Major League Baseball later acknowledged 
that the call was "improper," but that it was too late to overturn it.[14][15] 
Hernández was behind the plate for the final game at the old Yankee Stadium 
on September 21, 2008. Hernández was umpiring at third base when Jered 
Weaver threw a no-hitter on May 2, 2012.[16] He was the third base umpire 
on September 28, 2012, when Homer Bailey of the Cincinnati Reds no-hit
