Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2013 took place according to 
rules most recently revised in July 2010. As in the past, the Baseball 
Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from a 
ballot of recently retired players, with results announced on January 9, 
2013. The Pre-Integration Committee, the last of three new voting committees 
established during the July 2010 rules change to replace the more broadly 
defined Veterans Committee, convened early in December 2012 to select from 
a ballot of players and non-playing personnel who made their greatest contributions 
to the sport prior to 1947, called the "Pre-Integration Era" by the Hall 
of Fame.[1][2] For the first time since 1996 (and just the third time since 
1960), the BBWAA election resulted in no selections;[3] as the ballot featured 
numerous strong candidates, the result was widely viewed as a reflection 
of the deep controversy over players who were primarily active during a 
period when the sport was riddled with rumored use of performance-enhancing 
drugs (PEDs), and candidates appeared to have suffered in the voting regardless 
of whether they had been closely tied to any such rumors. The controversy's 
first major impact on the Hall of Fame ballot was seen in 2007, and the 
arrival in future years of additional candidates with either alleged or 
actual links to PED use suggested that the issue would be significant in 
Hall voting for at least several more years. For the first time since 1965, 
there were no living inductees.[4] The induction class of 2013 consisted 
of the three deceased individuals elected by the new Pre-Integration Committee: 
player Deacon White, umpire Hank O'Day, and executive Jacob Ruppert,[5] 
all of whom died in the 1930s.[6] As was the case following the 1965 election–which 
also resulted only in the induction of a member deceased for over 60 years, 
and led to the resumption of annual BBWAA elections–the voting results 
led to calls for revision of the voting rules.[7] The induction ceremonies 
were held on July 28, 2013 at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.[2] 
On July 27, the Hall of Fame presented two annual awards for media excellence—its 
own Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters and the BBWAA's J. G. Taylor Spink 
Award for writers,[8] and also honored sports medicine pioneer Dr. Frank 
Jobe and filmmaker Thomas Tull, producer of the 2013 film 42.[9] The BBWAA 
ballot was announced on November 28, 2012.[10] The BBWAA was authorized 
to elect players active in 1993 or later, but not after 2007; the ballot 
included candidates from the 2012 ballot who received at least 5% of the 
vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening 
committee, whose last appearance was in 2007. All 10-year members of the 
BBWAA were eligible to vote, and had until December 31, 2012 to return 
their ballots to the Hall.[10] There were 37 candidates on the ballot, 
13 who last played from 1993 to 2006 and received at least 5% support in 
the 2012 election plus 24 first-time candidates ().[10] Voters were instructed 
to support as many as ten candidates; write-in votes were not permitted. 
Results of the 2013 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 9, 
live on the MLB Network and streamed on the Hall's website. A total of 
569 ballots were cast, with 427 votes required for election. A total of 
3,756 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.6 per ballot- the highest 
per-ballot average since 2003 (also 6.6), and the first average of over 
six per ballot since 2007 (6.58). The 24 first-time candidates () last 
played during the 2007 major league season. Eighteen received less than 
5% support (*) and were thus eliminated from BBWAA consideration; six newcomers 
scored 5% support or more, the largest number since 1994. No player received 
the 75% support needed for election, the first such shutout since 1996 
and only the eighth in history. Dale Murphy was on the ballot for the 15th 
and final time. The newly eligible candidates included 29 All-Stars, seven 
of whom were not on the ballot, representing a total of 104 All-Star selections, 
a record, and over three times the number of 2012's class (33 All-Star 
selections among newly eligible candidates); until this year, only the 
class of 2007 had ever breached 100 selections (103). Among the candidates 
were 14-time All-Star, 7-time MVP and holder of both the single-season 
(73) and career (762) home run records Barry Bonds; 12-time All-Star Mike 
Piazza; 11-time All-Star and 7-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens; 
7-time All-Stars Craig Biggio and Sammy Sosa; and 6-time All-Stars Sandy 
Alomar, Jr., Kenny Lofton and Curt Schilling. The field included two Rookies 
of the Year, both catchers (Alomar and Piazza), three MVPs (in addition 
to Bonds' seven, Clemens and Sosa each won one apiece) and a Cy Young Award 
winner (Clemens). Bonds and Clemens, with seven apiece, hold the records 
for MVPs and Cy Young Awards won, respectively. The field included two 
candidates with at least five Gold Glove Awards: Bonds (seven in left field) 
and Steve Finley (five in center). It also included five candidates with 
at least five Silver Slugger Awards: Bonds (twelve in left field), Piazza 
(ten at catcher), Sosa (six in right field), Biggio (five total- four at 
second base and one at catcher) and Julio Franco (five total- four at second 
base and one at DH). Bonds holds the record for Silver Sluggers in the 
outfield, while Piazza holds the record at catcher. As in recent years, 
the controversy over use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) dominated 
the elections.[3][6][11][12] ESPN.com columnist Jim Caple noted in the 
days before the announcement of the 2012 results that the PED issue, combined 
with the BBWAA's limit of 10 votes per ballot, was likely to result in 
a major backlog in upcoming elections:[12] Another ESPN.com writer, Tim 
Kurkjian, added that the 2013 ballot would include several new candidates 
who either tested positive or were strongly linked to PEDs:[13] Several 
other players returning from the 2012 ballot with otherwise strong Hall 
credentials have been linked to PEDs, among them Mark McGwire (who admitted 
to long-term steroid use in 2010),[14] Jeff Bagwell (who never tested positive, 
but was the subject of PED rumors during his career),[15] and Rafael Palmeiro 
(who tested positive for stanozolol shortly after publicly denying that 
he had ever used steroids).[16] Players who were eligible for the first 
time who were not included on the ballot were: Antonio Alfonseca, Tony 
Batista, Mark Bellhorn, Hector Carrasco, Alberto Castillo, Rheal Cormier, 
Juan Encarnación, Robert Fick, Steve Kline, Ricky Ledée, Mike Lieberthal, 
John Mabry, Tom Martin, Damian Miller, Doug Mirabelli, Mike Myers, Orlando 
Palmeiro, Neifi Pérez, Desi Relaford, Paul Shuey, Scott Spiezio, Kelly 
Stinnett, John Thomson, José Valentín, John Wasdin, Rick White, Bob Wickman, 
Preston Wilson, Jay Witasick, and Jaret Wright.[17] In keeping with the 
new voting procedure by eras, the BBWAA-appointed Historical Overview Committee, 
made up of 11 BBWAA members, identified ten Pre-Integration candidates 
who were judged to have made their greatest contributions prior to 1947. 
Along with the era, these rules defined the consideration set:[2] However, 
due to the passage of time, the only listed criteria that materially restricted 
the field from which the candidates were selected were years of service 
and presence on baseball's ineligible list. The eleven BBWAA-appointed 
Historical Overview Committee members were Dave Van Dyck (Chicago Tribune); 
Bob Elliott (Toronto Sun); Rick Hummel (St. Louis Post-Dispatch); Steve 
Hirdt (Elias Sports Bureau); Bill Madden (New York Daily News); Ken Nigro 
(formerly Baltimore Sun); Jack O'Connell (BBWAA secretary/treasurer); Tracy 
Ringolsby (Root Sports Rocky Mountain/MLB.com); Glenn Schwarz (formerly 
San Francisco Chronicle); Claire Smith (ESPN); and Mark Whicker (Orange 
County Register).[18] The Pre-Integration ballot for election by the Pre-integration 
Committee was released on November 1, 2012,[18] and the Hall of Fame announced 
the results on December 3.[5] The Pre-Integration Committee's 16-member 
voting electorate, appointed by the Hall of Fame's Board of Directors, 
was announced at the same time as the ballot of 10 candidates:[18] The 
Pre-Integration Committee which elected three candidates to the Hall of 
Fame at the 2012 winter meetings in Nashville on December 2–3, with 75% 
or 12 of 16 votes required for election, convened at the July 28, 2013 
induction.[2] Ruppert, O'Day and White were elected.[19] Dahlen received 
10 of 16 votes, the highest total of anyone not elected; no one else received 
more than three votes.[5] The J. G. Taylor Spink Award has been presented 
by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962.[20] 
Through 2010, it was awarded during the main induction ceremony, but is 
now given the previous day at the Hall of Fame Awards Presentation. It 
recognizes a sportswriter "for meritorious contributions to baseball writing".[21] 
The recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are featured in 
a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum. The three nominees 
for the 2013 award were selected by a BBWAA committee and announced on 
July 10, 2012 at the BBWAA's annual All-Star Game meeting. They were Paul 
Hagen of MLB.com; Jim Hawkins, formerly of the Detroit Free Press; and 
Russell Schneider, formerly of The Plain Dealer of Cleveland. It was the 
second consecutive nomination for both Hagen and Schneider.[22] Following 
the announcement of the nominees, the entire BBWAA membership voted in 
fall 2012 to determine the recipient. Under BBWAA rules, the winner was 
to be announced either during the 2012 World Series or at the 2012 winter 
meetings; in keeping with the practice of recent years, the announcement 
was made at the winter meetings.[22] On December 4, Hagen was announced 
as the recipient, having received 269 of the 421 possible votes (including 
five blank ballots).[23] Hawkins received 87 votes and Schneider 60.[23] 
Hagen began his career in 1974 with the San Bernardino Sun, covering the 
Los Angeles Dodgers. He moved in 1977 to Dallas–Fort Worth, covering the 
Texas Rangers first for the Dallas Times Herald and later the Fort Worth 
Star-Telegram. From there, he moved to Philadelphia in 1987, covering the 
Phillies for the Philadelphia Daily News before becoming that paper's national 
baseball columnist in 2002.[23] After a 25-year career at the Daily News, 
he joined MLB.com in 2012.[22] The Ford C. Frick Award, honoring excellence 
in baseball broadcasting, has been presented at the induction ceremonies 
since 1978.[24] Through 2010, it had been presented at the main induction 
ceremony, but is now awarded at the Awards Presentation. Recipients are 
not members of the Hall of Fame but are permanently recognized in an exhibit 
at the museum. To be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have 
a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with 
a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two. The honor is based 
on four criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including 
national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity 
with fans. The recipient was announced on during the 2012 winter meetings, 
following a vote by the same committee that selected seven of the finalists 
(below).[25] Ten finalists were announced on October 9, 2012.[25] In accord 
with guidelines established in 2003, seven were chosen by a committee composed 
of the living recipients along with broadcasting historians and columnists. 
Three were selected from a list of candidates by fan voting at the Hall's 
Facebook page from August 20 to September 7.[26] Six candidates were living 
when the ballot was announced—the active Doucet, Nadel, Ortega, Shannon, 
and Staats; and the retired Gordon.[25] On December 5, Cheek, the lead 
radio play-by-play announcer for the Toronto Blue Jays from the team's 
establishment in 1977 until his retirement in 2004, was named the recipient.[27] 
During this tenure he had a 27-year streak of 4,306 consecutive games plus 
41 post-season games called, which lasted from the first ever Blue Jays 
game on April 7, 1977, to June 3, 2004, when he traveled to Salinas, California, 
for his father's funeral.[28] Cheek was forced to retire shortly after 
the funeral when he discovered he had a brain tumor, and he died in 2005.[27] 
The 2013 balloting marked the ninth consecutive year that Cheek had been 
named among the 10 finalists for the award. Cheek became the second Frick 
Award recipient to have worked primarily for a Canadian team, after 2011 
honoree Dave Van Horne; the award was his third for broadcasting excellence 
from a sports hall of fame. In 2001, while active with the Blue Jays, he 
received the Jack Graney Award, given irregularly for excellence in either 
writing or broadcasting, from the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.[29] Just 
before his death in 2005, Canada's Sports Hall of Fame created the Tom
