In its 115-year history, the Baltimore Orioles baseball franchise of Major 
League Baseball's American League has employed 42 managers.[1] The duties 
of the team manager include team strategy and leadership on and off the 
field.[2] Of those 42 managers, 12 have been "player-managers";[1] specifically, 
they managed the team while still being signed as a player.[3] Since 1992, 
the team has played its home games at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.[4] The 
Baltimore franchise began operations in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as the Brewers 
(not to be confused with the current National League team of the same name) 
in 1901.[5] After one season in Wisconsin under manager and Hall of Famer 
Hugh Duffy, the franchise moved south to St. Louis, Missouri, adopting 
the St. Louis Browns name and hiring a new manager, Jimmy McAleer. The 
Browns remained in Missouri until the end of the 1953 season, when Major 
League Baseball's owners elected to move the franchise to Baltimore, Maryland, 
where they were renamed the Orioles, after Maryland's state bird.[6] Seven 
managers have taken the Orioles franchise to the post-season; Earl Weaver 
led the Orioles to a team-record six playoff appearances. Weaver, Hank 
Bauer, and Joe Altobelli are the only managers who have won a World Series 
championship with the club:[7] Bauer in the 1966 World Series, over the 
Los Angeles Dodgers;[8] Weaver in the 1970 World Series, over the Cincinnati 
Reds;[9] and Altobelli in the 1983 World Series, over the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[10] Weaver is the longest-tenured manager in franchise history, 
with 2,541 games of service in parts of 17 seasons (1968–1982, 1985–1986).[11] 
The manager with the highest winning percentage in his career with the 
franchise is Luman Harris, owner of a .630 winning percentage during his 
27 games managed in 1961; conversely, the worst winning percentage in franchise 
history is .222 by Oscar Melillo, who posted a 2–7 record during the 1938 
season.[1] Eight Orioles managers have been elected to the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame, including Frank Robinson,[12] who was the first African-American 
manager in Major League Baseball;[13] and Rogers Hornsby, who was a member 
of the cross-city rival Cardinals during the franchise's tenure in St.
