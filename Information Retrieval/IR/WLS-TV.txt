WLS-TV, virtual channel 7 (UHF digital channel 44), is an ABC owned-and-operated 
television station located in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The station 
is owned by the ABC Owned Television Stations subsidiary of The Walt Disney 
Company. WLS-TV maintains studio facilities located on North State Street 
in the Chicago Loop, and its transmitter is located atop the Willis Tower 
on South Wacker Drive. The station first signed on the air on September 
17, 1948 as WENR-TV. It was the third television station to sign on in 
the Chicago market (behind WGN-TV (channel 9), which debuted six months 
earlier in April, and WBKB (channel 4, now WBBM-TV on channel 2), which 
signed on in September 1946). As one of the original ABC-owned stations 
on channel 7, it was the second station to begin operations, after WJZ-TV 
(now WABC-TV) in New York City (its sister stations in Detroit, San Francisco 
and Los Angeles signed on within a year of WENR's launch). The station's 
original call letters were taken from co-owned radio station WENR (890 
AM), which served as an affiliate of the ABC Radio Network (WENR would 
eventually merge with WLS-AM, with which it shared a frequency under a 
time-sharing arrangement until ABC purchased a 50% interest in WLS in 1954). 
In February 1953, ABC merged with United Paramount Theatres (UPT), the 
former theater division of Paramount Pictures. UPT subsidiary Balaban and 
Katz owned WBKB (which shared a CBS affiliation with WGN-TV). The newly 
merged American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, as the company was known 
then, could not keep both stations because of Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC) regulations then enforced that forbade the common ownership of two 
television stations licensed to the same market. As a result, WBKB's channel 
4 license was sold to CBS, which subsequently changed that station's call 
letters to WBBM-TV; that outlet would move to VHF channel 2 several months 
later on July 5, 1953. The old WBKB's on-air and behind-the-scenes staff 
stayed at the new WBBM-TV, while the WBKB call letters and management moved 
to channel 7 (from 1965 to 1968, a "-TV" suffix was included in the station's 
calls, modifying it to WBKB-TV). Sterling "Red" Quinlan served as the station's 
general manager from the early 1950s to the mid-1960s,[1] and became a 
giant in early Chicago television. Quinlan was instrumental in starting 
the careers of Tom Duggan, Frank Reynolds and Bob Newhart. The station 
courageously aired The Tom Duggan Show in the mid-1950s, which became the 
most popular show in the Chicago market, far outdrawing other network competition. 
Channel 7 had its call letters changed to WLS-TV on October 7, 1968,[2] 
named after WLS Radio (890 AM), which ABC had wholly owned since 1959 when 
the network bought the 50% interest it did not already hold in the station 
from Sears, Roebuck and Company.[3] Ironically, ABC merged WLS with WENR, 
its shared-time partner, in 1954.[4] WLS-TV had claimed to be "Chicago's 
first television station" in its sign-ons during the 1980s (implying a 
connection with the original WBKB on channel 4), but admitted to its true 
roots with WENR with its 30th anniversary in 1978.[5][6] On January 17, 
1984, WLS-TV launched Tele1st, an ABC-owned overnight subscription television 
service that carried a mix of films and lifestyle programs for four hours 
per night six days a week after the station's sign-off at 2:00 a.m.; the 
service was similar in format to competitor ONTV (which was carried locally 
on WSNS-TV, channel 44) and other over-the-air pay services that existed 
during the early and mid-1980s.[7][8] Tele1st was created with the concept 
of allowing users to record programming for later viewing; therefore, its 
decoder boxes were designed to unencrypt the signal only with the aid of 
a VCR. Scrambling codes that were sent to the box and relayed to the VCR 
were changed on a monthly basis, requiring subscribers to record additional 
footage airing immediately before and after that night's schedule to retrieve 
codes to play back the recorded programs properly; this resulted in any 
recordings being viewable only during that calendar month. Tele1st was 
deemed a failure, attributing only 4,000 subscribers at its peak, and ceased 
operations on June 30, 1984.[9] The station's digital channel is multiplexed: 
Prior to February 24, 2011, WLS-DT3 aired ABC 7 News Now with weather programming 
from The Local AccuWeather Channel. The ABC O&Os discontinued their Local 
AccuWeather channels in February 2011, replacing its programming with a 
letterboxed standard-definition simulcast of their Live Well subchannels; 
however, the partnership between ABC and AccuWeather continues to this 
day as the branding for the stations' weather reports. WLS-TV shut down 
its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on June 12, 2009, the official date 
in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned 
from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's 
digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 52, which 
was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting 
use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era VHF channel 7 for 
post-transition operations.[11] WLS operated its digital signal at low 
power (4.75 kW) to protect the digital signal of WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids, 
Michigan (which also broadcasts on channel 7, but at a much higher radiated 
power). As a result, many viewers were not able to receive the station.[12] 
The FCC sent extra personnel to Chicago, Philadelphia and New York City 
to deal with difficulties in those cities. WLS had received 1,735 calls 
just by the end of the day on June 12 (WBBM only received 600), and an 
estimated 5,000 calls in total by June 16. WLS-TV was just one station 
which needed to increase its signal strength or move its frequency to solve 
its problems, but a power increase required making sure no other stations 
were affected.[13] WLS received a two-week experimental permit for a power 
increase late in June.[14] WLS had also applied for a permit to construct 
a low-power fill-in digital translator station on UHF channel 32 (the former 
analog frequency of WFLD),[15] but abandoned that plan (the channel 32 
RF frequency has since been claimed by WMEU-CD). Eventually the FCC granted 
it a permit to transmit on a second frequency, UHF channel 44,[16] formerly 
occupied by WSNS-TV; WLS announced the availability of that frequency on 
October 31, 2009.[17] Throughout construction of the new maximized transmitting 
facilities at the Willis Tower, WLS operated both channels 7 and 44 from 
its auxiliary facilities at the John Hancock Center under an STA.[18] WLS 
operated channel 7 as a fill-in translator with a power of 7 kW,[19] and 
operating their full power operations on channel 44 with a power of 1 MW.[20] 
Through the use of PSIP technology, both operating frequencies were re-mapped 
and displayed as virtual channel 7, which would cause some digital tuners 
to have two versions of virtual channels 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3, while tuning 
sequentially. In October 2012, WLS-TV completed construction from the Willis 
Tower and its operating channel 44 at the 1 million watt power level.[21] 
The station continued its dual-frequency operations until 12:03 p.m. on 
March 18, 2013 when WLS-TV formally ceased operations on VHF channel 7, 
leaving UHF channel 44 as its permanent allotment.[22] Since WLS-TV officially 
moved its full-power operations to channel 44, it is the only ABC-owned 
station to vacate its former analog allotment for its digital operations 
and the second ABC O&O to operate its full-power operations on the UHF 
band, after Fresno sister station KFSN-TV. WLS-TV airs the entire ABC network 
schedule; however, it currently airs the Litton's Weekend Adventure educational 
programming block and the network's political/news discussion program This 
Week one hour later than most ABC stations due to its weekend morning newscasts. 
Syndicated programs broadcast on WLS-TV (as of September 2016[update]) 
include Live! with Kelly (Produced by sister station WABC), Inside Edition, 
Right This Minute, Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune (which is hosted by Chicago 
native Pat Sajak).[23] WLS-TV serves as the local over-the-air broadcaster 
of Monday Night Football games involving the Chicago Bears, airing simulcasts 
of the team's ESPN-televised games (WLS-TV's corporate parent, the The 
Walt Disney Company, holds 80% majority ownership stake in ESPN, and the 
ABC Owned Television Stations have right of first refusal for simulcasts 
of ESPN's NFL telecasts within a team's home market). Because of this, 
atypical for a network-owned station outside of breaking news and severe 
weather coverage necessitating such situations, the station has had to 
reschedule ABC network programs pre-empted by the telecasts. The preseason 
and MNF telecasts mark the only NFL games to have aired on WLS-TV since 
ABC lost the rights to NFL games in 2006; during the regular season, Bears 
games are rotated between WBBM-TV (through the NFL on CBS), WMAQ-TV (through 
NBC Sunday Night Football) and especially WFLD (through the NFL on Fox 
and select telecasts via the NFL Network's Thursday Night Football). Since 
2010, however, it has deferred the right of first refusal due to the popularity 
and live voting requirements of ABC's Dancing with the Stars, with WCIU-TV 
carrying the MNF games when the former program's fall season is ongoing 
(an exception being WLS' carriage of an MNF Bears game against the Dallas 
Cowboys on December 9, 2013, when the team honored former head coach Mike 
Ditka). On December 12, 2014, WLS-TV signed a new five-year broadcast agreement 
with the Chicago Cubs, in which WLS will televise 25 of the Major League 
Baseball team's games per year, starting with the 2015 season. The arrangement 
partially replaces one with WGN-TV (which has broadcast Cubs games since 
its inception in April 1948), which voluntarily pulled out of its existing 
broadcast deal with the team for the 2015 season and subsequently agreed 
to carry a reduced slate of 45 games (the remainder of the Cubs' over-the-air 
telecasts not carried by either WLS-TV or WGN-TV are carried by The CW 
affiliated/MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station WPWR-TV (channel 50), 
which airs those produced by WGN). As ABC has a limited sports programming 
schedule during the Major League Baseball season prior to September (when 
the MLB regular season and college football season overlap), the station 
mainly carries the team's weekend daytime games in order to limit pre-emptions 
of the network's prime time programming.[33][34][35][36] WLS-TV presently 
broadcasts 36 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five 
hours on weekdays and five and a half hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). 
In addition, it also presently produces an additional five hours of newscasts 
each week for WCIU-TV (consisting of one hour exclusively on weekdays). 
Combining the newscasts airing on the station's main channel and those 
it produces for WCIU through its news share agreement with that station, 
WLS-TV produces a total of 41 hours of newscasts each week. In 1969, WLS-TV 
adopted the Eyewitness News format that the other ABC owned-and-operated 
stations began implementing in the late 1960s, after the news format was 
popularized when it originated at New York City flagship WABC-TV. Beginning 
in 1968, the station's main evening newscasts were co-anchored by Fahey 
Flynn, a bowtie-wearing broadcaster who had spent the previous 15 years 
at WBBM-TV; and Joel Daly, who was hired away by WLS from WJW-TV in Cleveland 
in 1967. The duo served as the anchors of the station's 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. 
newscasts until Flynn's death in August 1983. In 1970, the two were joined 
by John Drury, who helmed the 5:00 p.m. newscast. By 1973, WLS' Eyewitness 
News broadcasts surpassed NBC-owned WMAQ-TV (channel 5)'s newscasts to 
become Chicago's top-rated news operation, a lead it held until WBBM-TV 
surpassed channel 7 for the top spot in 1979. For much of the 1970s and 
1980s, it waged a spirited battle for second place in the Chicago news 
ratings between its two main competitors. By 1983, a disastrous anchor 
change had dropped channel 7 into third place. This prompted two major 
changes to the station's management; ABC brought in Dennis Swanson from 
WLS-TV's Los Angeles sister station KABC-TV to serve as the station's new 
general manager. Swanson, in turn, hired Bill Applegate as the station's 
news director. In addition, ABC commissioned Frank Gari to compose an updated 
version of the Cool Hand Luke "Tar Sequence" theme widely associated with 
the Eyewitness News format. The result was News Series 2000, a theme package 
that was quickly picked up by the other ABC O&Os. Swanson was instrumental 
in hiring Oprah Winfrey to host its then low-rated morning talk show, AM 
Chicago, in 1983. Within a year, the program had shot to first place in 
the ratings. AM Chicago entered into national syndication in 1986 and was 
renamed The Oprah Winfrey Show. Channel 7 aired it, along with most of 
ABC's other owned-and-operated stations, until September 2011. Swanson 
also re-hired lead anchor John Drury, who had left for WGN-TV in 1979; 
and Floyd Kalber, who had led WMAQ-TV to the top of the ratings in the 
1960s. Drury and Mary Ann Childers were a popular anchor team at WLS-TV 
during the 1980s and 1990s, accompanied by weather anchor Steve Deshler 
and sports anchor Tim Weigel. In March 1986, channel 7 passed WBBM-TV as 
the highest-rated news station in Chicago. It has held the lead ever since, 
aside from a brief period when WBBM-TV managed to forge a tie for first 
in the late 1980s. In 1992, the station replaced the News Series 2000 package 
(as the other ABC O&Os did over the following year, due partly to increased 
royalties for use of the Cool Hand Luke theme and its variants by the original 
theme's composer, Lalo Schifrin) with a new news music package, also produced 
by Gari, called News Series 2000 Plus (since renamed Stimulus), which has 
remained in use by WLS ever since and was updated in 2013. In 1996, WLS-TV 
dropped the Eyewitness News brand after 26 years, in favor of the network-centric 
ABC 7 News; the move was part of a standard branding effort imposed by 
ABC across its owned-and-operated stations which saw the incorporation 
of the ABC name into their local brands[37] (most of the other ABC O&Os 
retained their existing news branding, as sister stations such as WABC-TV 
and WPVI-TV in Philadelphia retained their Eyewitness News or Action News 
identities). WLS-TV officially debuted a new street-side studio at its 
North State Street facility on April 10, 2006, during the station's morning 
newscast, although the station had begun broadcasting its newscasts from 
that studio two days earlier on April 8.[38] On the weekend of April 29–30, 
2006, WLS-TV upgraded its news helicopter with a high definition camera, 
rebranding it as "Chopper 7 HD." On January 6, 2007, WLS-TV became the 
first Chicago television station to broadcast its all of its local programming 
– including newscasts – in high definition, although most remote field 
footage remained in 16:9 widescreen standard definition at the time. Since 
then, WLS-TV upgraded most of its field footage to HD, although some field 
reports remain in widescreen SD. On December 23, 2007, a Mazda minivan 
drove through a reinforced studio window at the State Street Studio two 
minutes into the 10:00 p.m. newscast, startling anchor Ravi Baichwal on 
air and creating a 20° draft as the glass shattered upon the car's impact; 
no one was injured in the crash. Evanston resident Gerald Richardson was 
subsequently charged with felony damage to property for the incident.[39][40][41][42] 
On November 11, 2012, WLS-TV expanded its Sunday 8:00 a.m. newscast from 
1½ to two hours, leading into ABC's This Week.[43] The 8:00 a.m. portion 
of the Saturday morning newscast was expanded to two hours from 8:00 to 
10:00 a.m. on August 24, 2013. Nearly a week later on August 30, WLS-TV 
discontinued its hour-long weekday 11:00 a.m. newscast (which originated 
in 1992 as a half-hour program at 11:30, before it expanded into an earlier, 
one-hour broadcast on October 6, 2003 following the cancellation of Port 
Charles) after 21 years, and replaced it on September 2 with Windy City 
Live, whose original 9:00 a.m. slot became occupied by Live! with Kelly 
and Michael when it moved to WLS from WGN-TV on that date (as such, it 
became the first – and currently, the only – ABC owned-and-operated station 
without a midday newscast). With the move and the midday newscast's cancellation, 
news and weather cut-ins were incorporated into Windy City Live.[44][45] 
On October 26, 2013, WLS-TV reintroduced the Eyewitness News brand (as 
ABC 7 Eyewitness News), as part of an overall rebranding of its newscasts 
that included new graphics and a modernized update to the Stimulus theme. 
In an interview with media columnist Robert Feder, WLS-TV president/general 
manager John Idler cited the reasoning behind the restoration of the Eyewitness 
News brand, was that it "[still] resonated strongly with [viewers in] the 
Chicago market," despite being dropped by the station 17 years earlier.[37] 
On November 2, 2013, WLS expanded the early block of its weekend morning 
newscasts, with the extension of its hour-long 6:00 a.m. newscast on Saturdays 
and Sundays to two hours at 5:00 a.m.[46] On December 14, 2014, WLS-TV 
entered into a news share agreement with independent station WCIU-TV (channel 
26) to produce a weeknight-only 7:00 p.m. newscast titled ABC 7 Eyewitness 
News at 7:00 on The U; the program debuted on January 12, 2015, and is 
the fifth newscast produced by ABC O&O for a separately owned station in 
the station's home market (along with existing programs produced by sister 
stations in Raleigh, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Los Angeles for WLFL, 
WPHL-TV, KOFY-TV and KDOC-TV in the respective markets, and a since-cancelled 
newscast produced by KFSN-TV for KAIL in Fresno).[47][48] On June 27, 2016, 
WLS-TV revived its 11:00 a.m. newscasts for the first time since 2013, 
becoming the fourth television station in Chicago to do so; which completes 
against with WMAQ-TV (who reviving its midday newscasts in September 2011 
and moved to the time period in September 2014), WBBM-TV (who began airing 
a half-hour 11:00 a.m. newscasts in early 2000s), and WGN-TV (who began 
its midday newscasts in 1984; followed by some expansions in September 
2008 and October 2009). In June 2016 after several years of unsuccessful 
syndicated talk show replacements for the cancelled All My Children (including 
Katie and FABLife), the station moved General Hospital to 2 p.m., then 
Windy City Live to 1:00 p.m. to accommodate the 11 a.m. newscast, with 
a replay of the latter late night after Nightline.[31] According to the 
Nielsen local news ratings for the February 2011 sweeps period, WLS-TV 
remained in first place overall, with the 10 p.m. newscast getting a 9.7 
rating share, down a tenth of a point from a 9.8 during the same time the 
previous year.[49] The station remained in second place for its prime-time
