The sport of baseball is widely played in Palau, having been introduced 
by the Japanese during their occupation of the island nation. The highest 
level of league play in Palau in represented by Palau Major League (PML), 
which is overseen by the Belau Baseball Federation.[1] The country is represented 
in international play by the Palau national baseball team. The PML plays 
its games at the Asahi Field in Koror during a season lasting from January 
to April. No admission fee is charged for games.[2] As of 2002 there were 
seven teams in the PML in one division. Baseball was first brought to Palau 
by the Japanese, who annexed the islands from Germany in 1914 and controlled 
them until losing the Battle of Peleliu in November 1944. One noted early 
promoter of baseball on the islands was Motoji Kono, who worked for the 
Imperial Japanese government on Palau from 1922 to 1929. He is credited 
with a foundational role in Palauan baseball for his work teaching Palauan 
men the basic skill sets and rules necessary to play the game, as well 
as being an energetic promoter of the sport, primarily from 1925 onwards.[3] 
Most Palauan players in the 1920s were employed with the Japanese administration 
on the island.[4] In 1927 and 1928, a team of top Palauan players dubbed 
the All Palau Team played an annual series against a team composed of Japanese 
administrators. Although the Japanese won the first series, the All Palau 
team took 1928 match, leading the Japanese to segregate baseball on the 
island so that Palauans and Japanese players competed amongst themselves 
but not against each other.[5] American soldiers who occupied Palau at 
the end of and following World War II further promoted the game on the 
island. American soldiers provided endurance training and helped develop 
the islanders' pitching and fielding, particularly working to cultivate 
their infield skills.[6] The PML was founded in 1947,[7] with the league 
culminating in the All-Palau Baseball Championship. A team from Peleliu 
was dominant in the postwar years, winning seven titles between 1947 and 
1957. Peleliu suffered a notable defeat in the 1955 All-Palau Baseball 
Championship to a team of students from Koror Intermediate School.[8] Peleliu 
won three championships in the 1960s: in 1960, 1961 and 1969. The team 
hasn't won a PML championship since 1969. In 1962, the Airai Comets won 
the PML championship for the first time, defeating the Ngardmau Cardinals.[9] 
In the same year, a team of Palauan all-stars secured the nation's first 
success in international competition, winning a three-game set against 
a team of Guamanian all-stars 2-0. Palau was the visiting team for the 
series, which was held at Chief Quipuha Park.[10][11] The team was a sensation 
upon its arrival in Palau, where they were hosted at the Kebtol'l Bai (double 
bai) in Koror. Bai is the local Palauan name for the steep-roofed shelter 
built as a meeting place for the village elders. Chiefs from all the clans 
in Palau were present for a feast held in the team's honor.[12] In 1963, 
Palau Vocational School defeated Ngardmau to become the first student team 
to win the All-Palau Championship since 1955. The 1963 trophy is still 
kept in the trophy case at Palau Community College (PCC).[13] An team of 
Palauan all-stars participated in further international competition in 
1963, defeating a team from Xavier High School on Chuuk and winning a three-game 
series against a team of Pohnpei all-stars, two games to one. The final 
game narrowly avoided a rainout that would have led to a Pohnpei victory 
as Palau only pulled ahead in the late innings. As such, much credit for 
the victory was given to the Palauan team magician for overcoming the spells 
of the Pohnpeiian magician.[14] For the 1966 season, the PML contained 
ten teams divided into two, five team leagues. The Palau League contained 
Palau High School, Melekeok, Ngaremlengui, Peleliu A, and Airai. The Territorial 
League contained the Ngaraard Red Torch, Ngiwal, Koror, Aimeliik, and Peleliu 
B.[15] However, the number and identity of the teams that participated 
in the PML varied significantly from year to year. The Ngardmau Cardinals 
won the 1967 All Palau Baseball Championship, defeating team Asahi. The 
team won again in 1968, and went on to defeat a team of Palauan all-stars 
in the same year. The PML had seven teams in one division for the 1968 
season. The competing teams were the Cardinals, Asahi, the Red Torch, Ngarametal, 
Ngarabelod, Ngarchelong and Peleliu.[16] Peleliu won the 1969 championship, 
going 8-2 over the course of the regular season.[17] The Palauan National 
Baseball Team participated in the 1969 Micronesian Olympic Games in Saipan.[18] 
There are few existing records chronicling the PML in the 1970s,[19] but 
the Red Torch appear to have dominated the decade. The team won the All-Palau 
Baseball Championship in 1970, 1973, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979. Meyuns 
won the championship in 1971, and Palau High School won in 1972. Meyuns 
repeated in 1975. Asahi field also underwent a renovation at some point 
the 1970s that included covered bleachers.[20] In 1973, a lawsuit was brought 
by the team from Ngaremlengui against the Aimeliik team for a game that 
Ngaremlengui won in the bottom of the ninth that the manager of the Aimeliik 
team felt should have concluded in the top of the ninth due to time limitations. 
The Parks Board ruled in favor of Aimeliik, leading Ngaremlengui to file 
suit against the decision.[21] The 1981 PML season was canceled to allow 
the Palauan national team time to prepare for the 1981 Ambassadors Memorial 
Baseball Tournament in Guam. The tournament was played from May 22 to May 
31, and in addition to the team from Palau included the Ponape All-Stars, 
who represented all the Federated States of Micronesia, Athletes in Action 
Ambassadors, the University of Guam Tritons, and the APL Los Amigos, that 
year's champions of the Island Baseball League in Guam. Palau's team lost 
in the semi-finals, with Los Amigos winning the tournament.[22] The Airai 
Aces won every championship between 1982 and 1989 save for 1986.[23] Peleliu 
opted to forfeit the third game of the 1982 championship after dropping 
the first two games, and lost to Airai in the 1982 championship as well. 
Ngerbeches overcame Airai in the 1986 PML championship series, winning 
the set 3-2.[24] As of 1989, there were five teams in the PML in one division.[25] 
The Airai Aces' success continued into the 1990s, with the team taking 
the PML Championship outright in 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995, and 1996, and 
splitting the championship with Ngerbeched in 1991. Ngerbeched won the 
PML Finals in 1993 and 1997. A joint Ngerbeched-Ngerbeches team was the 
1998 PML champion.[26] Palau's national team took the gold medal for baseball 
in the 1990 Micronesian Games in Saipan, beating Guam 8-0 in the final,[27] 
and in the 1998 Games held in Palau.[28] Palau took the bronze in baseball 
in the 1994 Micronesian Games.[29] The 1999 PML season was cut short to 
allow Palau's athletes to train for the South Pacific Games, in which Palau 
finished 5th in baseball.[30] The PML had seven teams in one division for 
the 2000 season.[31] Ngerbeched was the 2000 PML champion, the team's third 
title in a row (not including the shortened 1999 season for which no champion 
was announced). Ngerbeched repeated in 2001, narrowly defeating Aimeliik 
in the finals.[32] Airai returned to form to take the 2002, 2003 and 2004 
titles,[33] Koror defeated Ngerbeched to win the first PML title in the 
team's 60-year history in 2005.[34] The team repeated in 2006, defeating 
Airai in the finals.[35] Airai took the 2007 PML championship by defeating 
PCC four games to two in a seven-game championship series.[36] Ngerbeched 
won the 2008 PML season.[37] A team of Palauan youths aged 16 to 18 years 
took second placed in baseball in the inaugural 2004 Oceania AAA Baseball 
Tournament, held in Palau.[38] Palau's national team took the gold in baseball 
in the 2007 Pacific Games in Samoa, finishing the tournament unbeaten with 
an 8-0 record, though the championship game was canceled due to rain.[39] 
The national baseball team took the bronze in baseball in the 2002 and 
2006 Micronesian Games.[40] However, Palau rebounded to take the gold medal 
in the 2010 Micronesian Games in Palau, defeating a team from the Northern
