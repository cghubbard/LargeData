the ceremonial competitions amongst the pre-Columbian Native Americans 
of the Arawak (Taíno) tribes which inhabited the island to the modern era 
in which sports activities consist of an organized physical activity or 
skill carried out with a recreational purpose for competition. One of the 
sports which the Taíno's played was a ball game called "Batey". The "Batey" 
was played in "U" shaped fields two teams, however unlike the ball games 
of the modern era, the winners were treated like heroes and the losers 
were sacrificed. The Spanish Conquistadores who conquered the island introduced 
various sports such as horse racing, cockfighting, dominoes and a game 
similar to "Bowling" called "Boliche". The Spaniards however did not participate 
in team sports. Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States as a result 
of their defeat in the 1898 Spanish–American War. American soldiers who 
organized games as part of their training introduced the sport of Boxing 
and Basketball to the people of Puerto Rico, however the sport of Baseball 
which was invented in the United States was introduced to the island by 
a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who learned the sport in the United 
States. Puerto Rico participates in the Olympics as an independent nation 
even though it is a territory of the United States. Puerto Rico has participated 
as such since the 1948 Summer Olympics celebrated in London. On March 2, 
1917, Puerto Ricans became citizens of the United States as a result of 
the enactment of the Jones–Shafroth Act (Pub.L. 64–368, 39 Stat. 951. Therefore, 
the Puerto Ricans who resided in the United States mainland are permitted 
to participate and represent that country in international sports events 
and their achievements are part of the history of the sports in Puerto 
Rico. The following is the list and history of the most common sports practiced 
in Puerto Rico and of Puerto Ricans or people of Puerto Rican descent who 
have excelled in those sports locally and/or in international events as 
representatives of Puerto Rico or any other country. The Taínos who inhabited 
Puerto Rico before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, played 
a series of games which were both ceremonial and diversional, such as races, 
contests involving body strength and fishing. However, the two most important 
of these sports were the simulated warrior fights (similar to the gladiators) 
and ball playing. The ball game was played in a field, which they called 
"Batey", situated in the middle of the village. The fields were either 
shaped like a triangle or like a "U". The ball was made of vegetable leaves, 
which gave it flexibility. Two teams played against each other. The objective 
of the game was to keep the ball in constant motion. The players were allowed 
to use their heads, elbows, shoulders and knees. The team would lose a 
point, if for any reason the ball stopped moving. The score was kept with 
a mark on the ground and the game would end after the losing team received 
a certain amount of points. The winners were treated like heroes and the 
losers were sacrificed. The game had changed by the time the first Spanish 
settlers arrived. According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas the game was 
played in the following manner: "One team served the ball and the other 
team returned it, using anything but the hands. If the ball arrived at 
shoulder height, it was returned like lightning. When it came in near the 
ground, the player rapidly hit the ground, striking the ball with his buttocks. 
Play continued from side to side until an error was made." In 1975, archaeologists 
from the Guaynia Society of Archeology and History at the Catholic University 
of Puerto Rico, members of the Archeological Society of the Southwest announced 
the discovery of the ruins of a "Batey" in an area called Tibes, on the 
outskirts of the city of Ponce. A total of 9 ball fields were discovered 
under thick forest overgrowth dating back to AD 25 in the area which is 
now known as "Centro Ceremonial Indigena de Tibes" (The Tibes Indigenoius 
Ceremonial Center). The site is now a tourist attraction and is open to 
the public. Artifacts found on the site are on display and can be seen 
in a museum on the site and in the Ponce Museum of Art.[1] The first Spaniards 
to inhabit the island were soldiers (Conquistadores), later they were followed 
by farmers, miners and their families. Team sports were virtually unheard 
of however, there were other types of competitions and sports in which 
they participated. The most common sports were horse racing, cockfighting 
and dominoes. The first horse track was built in San Juan in 1887. One 
of the most popular sports was "Boliche". The men would gather in the town 
plaza and roll a small ball made of wood with the objective of knocking 
down pins. "Boliche" was similar to bowling. Another popular sport was 
bullfighting, which was limited to the larger cities of Ponce and San Juan. 
In the late 19th century "new" sports were introduced in Puerto Rico, after 
Puerto Rico became an American territory when the United States defeated 
Spain in the Spanish–American War. Baseball, which was invented in the 
United States, was introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans 
and Cubans who learned the sport in the United States. The sport was also 
played by the American soldiers who organized games as part of their training. 
Puerto Ricans were also introduced to the sports of boxing and basketball 
by the occupying military forces. Puerto Rico participates in the Olympics 
as an independent nation but because of Puerto Ricans having American citizenship, 
Puerto Rican athletes have the option of representing Puerto Rico or moving 
to the United States, living there for 3 previous years or more and then 
representing that country in the games. Some Puerto Ricans, such as Gigi 
Fernández in tennis, have won gold medals for the U.S. The 1948 Summer 
Olympics celebrated in London, was a historical one for Puerto Rico because 
it was the first time that the island would participate as a nation in 
a major international sporting event. The island's delegation consisted 
of only three members, two of which finished among the ten best in pole 
vault.[2] In their regional participations, the Puerto Ricans had carried 
the United States flag into the games.[3] The United States protested, 
claiming that two nations could not use the same flag at the same time. 
The decree of Commonwealth on July 25, 1952 would give the Puerto Rican 
delegation a flag of their own. In 1980, the United States boycotted the 
Olympic Games in Moscow, Russia. Germán Rieckehoff, who was then the president 
of the Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, was against the boycott because 
he believed that politics should not get involved with sporting events. 
He was, therefore, denied economic support from the local government. Rieckehoff 
did however, manage to send one athlete to represent Puerto Rico in boxing, 
Alberto Mercado, who became the only American citizen to participate in 
the 1980 Olympics. In 1982, the Government of Puerto Rico, headed by then 
governor Carlos Romero Barceló, withheld economic support from the athletic 
delegation headed to Cuba, where the Central American and Caribbean Games 
were going to be held. The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, under the leadership 
of Rieckehoff, had to appeal directly to the people for donations and were 
able to send the delegation. The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee is also 
the organization in charge of selecting the Puerto Rican athletes which 
represent the island in the Pan American Games and the Central American 
and Caribbean Games. The 1988 Winter Olympics, officially known as the 
"XV Olympic Winter Games", was celebrated in Calgary, Alberta, Canada between 
February 13 and 28. It was the first Winter Olympics ever held in Canada. 
It was also the first time that a Puerto Rican team was sent to represent 
the island in an Olympic ski competition. No Puerto Rican had ever skied 
in the Olympics. The six-person Puerto Rican ski team was made up of native 
Puerto Ricans. They were Félix Flechas, Walter Sandza, Kevin Wilson, his 
sister Mary Pat Wilson and Jason Edelmann. Mary Pat Wilson is Puerto Rico’s 
first and only female Olympic skier. Even though the team did not do well 
in the competition, they were highly respected by their competitors.[4] 
At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Mónica Puig made Olympic 
history[5] when she became the first person to win an Olympic gold medal 
for Puerto Rico by defeating Germany's Angelique Kerber in the women's 
singles tennis final. She became the first Puerto Rican female medalist 
in any sport.[6] The following table has a list of Puerto Ricans, including 
people of Puerto Rican ancestry, who won Olympic medals. It must be noted 
that "Puerto Ricans" is a term also used to describe a resident of the 
United States who was "born in Puerto Rico or who traces their family ancestry 
to Puerto Rico."[7] Not all represented the island, some represented the 
United States. Puerto Ricans have won a total of 34 Olympic medals, 25 
for the United States and 9 for Puerto Rico. Notes: Puerto Rico debuted 
in the Paralympic Games on 1988.[8] In this event, Isabel Bustamante was 
awarded the first medals for the delegation, winning one gold and two silver 
medals in athletics.[8] In the 2000 Summer Paralympics, Alexis Pizarro 
became the first male athlete to win a medal for Puerto Rico, reaching 
bronze in athletics.[8] Pizarro repeated this performance in the 2004 Summer 
Paralympics.[8] On August 20, 2008, David Bernier awarded the flag of Puerto 
Rico to Nilda Gómez, who was selected to be the flag bearer in the opening 
ceremonies of the 2008 Paralympics.[9] Three athletes that registered A-marks 
attended the ceremony, which also included Alexis Pizarro in athletics 
and Julio Reguero in sailing. Puerto Rico's first medal in this edition 
of the Paralympics was won by Gómez, who won bronze in rifle shooting.[10] 
She won bronze in the 10-meter trial, finishing with 489 points.[10] Puerto 
Rico's Special Olympics program was founded in 1970, since then it has 
offered services to more than a thousand athletes.[11] In the 2003 Special 
Olympics World Summer Games, Puerto Rico won 57 medals.[11] Puerto Rico 
won a total of 34 medals in the 2007 Special Olympics World Summer Games, 
including 7 gold, 18 silver and 9 bronze medals. Due to the team's performance, 
the Senate of Puerto Rico organized a ceremony where the athletes and trainers 
received recognitions.[12] Ron Rivera became the first NFL player of Puerto 
Rican descent when he played for the Chicago Bears in the 1980s. In 1986, 
Rivera also became the first NFL player of Puerto Rican descent to win 
a Super Bowl championship ring. Others who have played in the NFL are O.J. 
Santiago of the Atlanta Falcons, Marco Rivera who now plays for the Dallas 
Cowboys and who in 2002 became the first Puerto Rican to play in the Pro 
Bowl as a member of the Green Bay Packers (the first of three appearances) 
and Glenn Martinez who in 2005 played for the Detroit Lions, Ken Amato 
who currently (2007) plays for the Tennessee Titans and Alvin Pearman who 
currently (2008) plays with the Jacksonville Jaguars are of Puerto Rican 
descent. Willie Colon who was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2006 
and won Super Bowl XLIII is also of Puerto Rican descent. Aaron Hernandez 
of the New England Patriots is also of Puerto Rican descent. Victor Cruz, 
another player of Puerto Rican descent, plays for the New York Giants and 
is known for his salsa touchdown dance. While all of these players are 
of Puerto Rican descent, there has yet to be a Puerto Rican born NFL player. 
American Football has been played in the island for many decades, dating 
all the way back to the installment of American military bases. Puerto 
Rico currently has 4 football leagues. PR Pee Wee league, for children 
8-16, PRHSFL, for high school students, the newly created AFAF, for college 
students, and PRAFL, a semi-professional league. Although football has 
been in the island for so many years, it is not widely known. Many things 
attribute to this, for example lack of proper funding and advertising, 
lack of high school affiliated teams, both attributing to lack of good 
coaching. In July 2012, the Puerto Rico American Football Federation became 
a member of the International Federation of American Football.[13] Pee 
Wee Football League This federation has 4 divisions, with areas in: Baldrich, 
Parque Central, University Gardens, Parkville, Ft. Buchanan, Carolina, 
and lastly Caguas.[14] The league is played from January to March at "El 
Complejo Deportivo Roberto Clemente" in San Juan Saturday mornings. The 
following is a table with the years and weight distribution for each division: 
PRHSFL This league has 6 Varsity teams and 3 teams at Junior Varsity level. 
the league is made up of 2 schools, Antilles High School Pirates, and Commonwealth 
Comets, and four clubs, Carolina Blittz, Bayamón Wolfpack, University Garden 
Dolphins, and Parque Central Blue Wave.[14] AFAF This league was founded 
in 2009 to rival the PRAFL and to one day be a part of local college athletics. 
There are four teams, Cataño Gators, San Juan Hurricanes, Carolina Blittz, 
and Baldrige Falcons.[14] PRAFL (Puerto Rico American Football League) 
A semi-professional league founded in 1985, with 5 teams. The Bayamón Wolfpack, 
Baldrich 57 Falcons, Carolina Blitzz, Cataño Lancheros, and Fajardo Cariduros. 
The Cataño Lancheros were the 2011 PRAFL Champions. During the late 19th 
century Puerto Rico was to witness the introduction of organized team sports. 
The game of baseball was first introduced to the island by a group of Puerto 
Ricans and Cubans who had learned the game in the United States. At first 
the sport was not well received by the local press and general public, 
it was looked upon as a silly game. The first two baseball clubs were founded 
in 1897. They were the Almendares Baseball Club, owned by Francisco Alamo 
Armas and the Borinquen Baseball Club owned by Santos Filippi.[15] According 
to the daily newspaper El País, on January 11, 1898, the first organized 
baseball game was played in Puerto Rico at the old velodrome which was 
located at the Pda.15 in Santurce, San Juan. The Borinquen team beat the 
Almendares with a score of 3 to 0. The first game to go a complete nine 
innings was played on January 30, 1898 and the Borinquen once again beat 
the Almendares with a score of 9 to 3.[15] Puerto Rico became an American 
territory when the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish–American 
War. The American soldiers stationed in Puerto Rico were permitted to organize 
a baseball club to play against the local clubs as diversional outlet. 
On November 4, 1900 the Almendares Baseball Club composed of Puerto Ricans 
and Cubans beat the American Baseball Club of the Second Regiment of Infantry 
with a score of 32 to 18.[15] In the early 1920s, teams from Puerto Rico, 
such as the San Juan Stars, would travel to New York City and play against 
some of teams there which included teams made up of Puerto Ricans who lived 
there. Modern era Puerto Rico has over 100 Major League Baseball players 
who are currently active, in addition to the hundreds others who have participated 
in the past. These facts combine to make baseball one of the most popular 
sports in the island. Some of the most notable baseball players from Puerto 
Rico are three Hall of Famers Roberto Clemente, Orlando Cepeda and Roberto 
Alomar. Another baseball player who is a Hall of Famer and who was born 
to a Puerto Rican father is Reginald Martinez "Reggie" Jackson. Also amongst 
the notable players or former players are Jose "Cheo" Cruz, Juan González, 
Edgar Martínez, Victor Pellot, Jorge Posada, Iván Rodríguez and Bernie 
Williams. Chronological order of major events Puerto Rico has a winter 
baseball league named the Puerto Rico Baseball League that has operated 
since the early 20th century. The champion of the Puerto Rico league represents 
Puerto Rico is in the annual Caribbean World Series. It currently has six 
teams: The Puerto Rico national baseball team competes in international 
events, including the World Baseball Classic, separately from the United 
States. Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan has hosted first-round games 
in each of the first three World Baseball Classic tournaments. The United 
States military government banned cockfighting and bullfighting from the 
island. They did, however introduce a "new" sport called basketball. Basketball 
was used by the American soldiers as part of their physical training. When 
the soldiers played basketball, they used a plain straw basket which was 
cut open at both ends and placed it on the highest end of a pole. For a 
ball, they used a football and the game was played without any established 
set of rules.[17] In 1913, the YMCA of Puerto Rico organized the first 
game played using the official rules of basketball and in 1916, the YMCA 
organized the first basketball tournament in Puerto Rico. Teams organized 
in the other YMCAs in the island participated in the tournament. The first 
basketball organization in Puerto Rico was the San Juan Basketball League. 
Río Piedras and Bayamón later followed and formed their own leagues.[17] 
Basketball became a popular sport in Puerto Rico, due in part to the BSN, 
which has been around since the 1930s. During the early 1980s, with many 
games shown on television, the sport's popularity increased. There is also 
a women's professional league, which is affiliated to the BSN. Street basketball 
is also popular among Puerto Rico's youth.[17] Chronological order of major 
events Puerto Rico's national basketball team has reached the Olympic Games 
multiple times, including the 2004 Athens Olympics, where they became the 
first team to defeat the United States Dream Team during Olympic competition. 
Puerto Rico's national team has won gold medals in other international 
competitions. Puerto Ricans have also been members of the Harlem Globetrotters. 
In 1995, Orlando Antigua, whose mother is Puerto Rican, became the first 
non-black in 52 years to play for the Harlem Globetrotters.[19] In 2008, 
Orlando Melendez a.k.a. "El Gato" became the first Puerto Rican-born player 
and the second Hispanic to play for the Harlem Globetrotters.[20] Puerto 
Rico had a Bobsled team in the 1992, 1994 and 1998 Winter Olympics. The 
sport of boxing was also introduced by the United States military which 
occupied Puerto Rico and the same as Basketball, boxing was used by the 
American soldiers as part of their physical training. Boxing competitions 
amongst the soldiers were open to the public. The first boxing match in 
Puerto Rico was held on January 15, 1899. Boxing has, for many years, disputed 
the top spot for the Puerto Rican fan's favorite sport with Baseball and 
Basketball. Puerto Ricans have distinguished themselves both as amateurs 
and professionals. In 1917, Nero Chen became the first Puerto Rican professional 
boxer to gain international recognition.[21] Puerto Rico has also been 
the site of many championship fights. In 1948, boxer Juan Evangelista Venegas 
earned Puerto Rico's first Olympic medal, finishing his participation in 
London with a bronze medal that year. Subsequently, Puerto Rico has earned 
five more medals in Olympic boxing, including a silver one by Luis Ortiz 
in 1984. That silver medal is the only silver medal ever won by any Puerto 
Rican native at Olympic Games. Although he did not win a medal, Alberto 
Mercado became, in 1980, the only American citizen to actually participate 
in the Moscow Olympics. There are eleven Puerto Ricans in the International 
Boxing Hall of Fame, they are Puerto Rico's first world champion Sixto 
Escobar, Wilfred Benítez, Wilfredo Gómez, Carlos Ortíz, Edwin Rosario, 
Pedro Montañez, José Chegui Torres, Joe Cortez (referee), Herbert "Cocoa 
Kid" Hardwick, Felix "Tito" Trinidad and Hector "Macho" Camacho. Benítez 
(The youngest champion in boxing's history) as of May 23, 1981, was the 
youngest three-time world champion after knocking out World Junior Middleweight 
champion Maurice Hope. Hardwick, was a member of the feared "Black Murderers' 
Row".[22] Other boxers from Puerto Rico which have excelled in the sport 
include: Carlos De Leon, Ossie Ocasio, Alfredo Escalera, Belinda Laracuente, 
John Ruiz who made history by becoming boxing's first Latin American world 
Heavyweight champion ever, after beating WBA world champ Evander Holyfield, 
Alex Sánchez, Samuel Serrano, Ada Vélez, who is the first Puerto Rican 
Women's boxing world champion and Miguel Cotto. In 2006, Puerto Rican Miguel 
Santana made boxing history by becoming the fighter who waited the longest 
after a title bout to find out he had become a world champion boxer. The 
IBF recognized Santana as a world Lightweight champion 18 years after his 
challenge of IBF Lightweight champion Greg Haugen, who originally beat 
Santana by an eleventh round technical decision. Chronological order of 
major events Among the international boxers who fought in Puerto Rico in 
a title bout are Muhammad Ali, Roberto Durán, and Alexis Argüello. The 
1970s became known in Puerto Rico as the golden era of Borinquen's (Puerto 
Rico's) Boxing.      = Indicates the person is no longer alive Unlike in 
most states of the United States, cockfighting is legal in Puerto Rico, 
and there are many places that draw large crowds to see bantams fighting 
every weekend. It is known as the Gentleman's Sport due to the common practice 
of wagers being a verbal contract between two individuals and may range 
from $1 to thousands of dollars. Across the world, Puerto Rico has been 
seen as the largest capital for the controversial sport, as it is incredibly 
popular and often televised as other sports are. Roosters are specially 
bred to fight, first entering the ring between one and two years of age. 
The sport of equestrianism has certain popularity in Puerto Rico, more 
so among members of higher classes. Puerto Rico frequently sends contestants 
to different international tournaments, such as the Olympics. On August 
16, 2003, Mark Watringl from the town of Aguadilla, represented the United 
States in the Pan American Games celebrated in the Dominican Republic. 
There he won the "Gold Medal" with a final total of 13.66 penalties compared 
to the 21.87 posted by Mexico. When presented with the Gold Medal, Watring 
unfurled and waved the Puerto Rican Flag. This win secured a berth in the 
2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. Watring represented Puerto Rico in 
the 2004 Olympics. Fencing in Puerto Rico has become popular ever since 
David "Kike" Bernier, Victor Bernier and the brothers Jonathan and Marcos 
Peña have won medals in the 2003 Pan American Games celebrated in the Dominican 
Republic.Mirthescka Escanellas was also a popular Puerto Rican fencer. 
She participated at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, among 
many other international events. While golf is not very popular in Puerto 
Rico, there are many golf courses across the island such as the one at 
Club Deportivo del Oeste. The most famous Puerto Rican golfer is Juan "Chi-Chi" 
Rodríguez who was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1992. Rodríguez 
used to put his hat over the hole whenever he made a birdie or eagle. After 
he heard that other golfers were complaining about his little act, he decided 
to try something new. Rodríguez developed his signature "toreador dance", 
where he would make believe that the birdie was a "bull" and that his putter 
was a "sword" and he would terminate the "bull". Rodríguez represented 
Puerto Rico on 12 World Cup teams. In 1986, he won the Hispanic Recognition 
Award. In 1988, he was named "Replica's Hispanic Man of the Year". Horse 
Racing is a sport which was first introduced to Puerto Rico by the Conquistadores. 
Horse Races continue to be a very popular sport in Puerto Rico til this 
day. During the earlier part of the 20th. century, races were held at El 
Comandante race track. Since 1972, El Nuevo Comandante now called "Hipodromo 
Camarero", in Canóvanas, has been the home of Puerto Rico's Sunday horse 
races, and of the annual Clasico del Caribe, a race that reunites important 
horses from many countries. Famous jockeys include J. A. Garcia and U.S. 
Racing Hall of Fame member, Angel Cordero, Jr. Cordero is one of the leading 
thoroughbred horse racing jockeys of all time in terms of wins. He was 
the first and only Puerto Rican jockey to win all three of the American 
Classic Races which consist of the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and 
the Belmont Stakes. Two of the most famous horses in Puerto Rican history 
were Camarero (world record holder for consecutive wins) Bold Forbes (1976 
Kentucky Derby winner) and several Clasico del Caribe winners. Road running 
have long been a part of Puerto Rico's sporting tradition. Many important 
races are run annually in the island, including the Maraton de San Blas 
in Coamo, long considered one of the most important half marathon races 
in the world, and the Ponce Marathon. The World's Best 10K (WB10K), also 
known as Maratón Teodoro Moscoso, is a 10K run celebrated in San Juan, 
Puerto Rico every year. It is certified by the Association of International 
Marathons and Road Races (AIMS) and by the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation (IAAF). The event was also the first race transmitted live through 
the Internet, with audio, video and results. WB10K was ranked among the 
20 most competitive races in the world. Famous marathon runners include: 
Jorge "Peco" González, Hunga Maldonado. Martial arts sports, especially 
karate, have had a marked ascent in popularity in Puerto Rico since the 
1970s, when Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan movies were very popular among Puerto 
Rico's youth. Jaime Espinal won a silver medal for Puerto Rico at the 84 kg 
Men's freestyle category at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, earning 
Puerto Rico its second ever silver medal at the Olympics, its first since 
boxer Luis Ortiz in 1984, and its first Olympic medal in wrestling. Professional 
wrestling has enjoyed much popularity in Puerto Rico for a long time. Matches 
have been televised since the 1960s, and multiple, non televised matches 
are held each week across the island. World Wrestling Council is the main 
wrestling promoter in Puerto Rico. Famous Puerto Rican wrestlers have included 
Barrabas, Carlos Colón and his sons, Carlito and Primo Colon, Los Invaders, 
Savio Vega, WWF* Hall of Famer Pedro Morales, and Los Super Medicos. In 
addition, many World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE, formerly WWF) stars, 
such as Randy Savage, and Ric Flair fought in Puerto Rico before. Women's 
wrestling has been gaining popularity in Puerto Rico since the 1990s with 
performers like La Tigresa, and Black Rose. Sailing as a sport has picked 
up in popularity in Puerto Rico since the middle 1990s, under the leadership 
of Enrique Figueroa and his wife, Carla Malatrasi. The pair have combined 
to win many international medals, and they competed at the 2000 Olympic 
Games. Figueroa also participated at the 1992 Olympics. On February 2, 
2004, Figueroa and teammate Jorge Hernández, won the Olympic Games Rolex 
Regatta. They were named champions by topping 29 entries in the tornado 
fleet. The regatta winners had their sights set on the 2004 Olympics and 
Paralympic Games in Athens, Greece. 503 sailors participated with a fleet

Games and represented Puerto Rico. The sport known as "soccer" in the United 
States, is also known and referred to as "Football" or in the Spanish language 
as "balompié or fútbol". Puerto Rico has a Puerto Rico Soccer League which 
is sponsored by the Federación Puertorriqueña de Fútbol. Soccer, unlike 
in many of the other Latin American countries, mainly because of the strong 
American culture influence on the Island, did not enjoy high popularity 
during the 20th century. But since the new millennium it has slowly increased 
its fan base on the island. Puerto Rico has a FIFA sponsored federation, 
the Federación Puertorriqueña de Fútbol and a Senior National Team which 
is ranked 106 by FIFA. Puerto Rico has only made it as far as the second 
round or regional play for a World Cup Qualifier, this was in 2008 when 
it beat Dominican Republic 1-0 in the first round and lost against Honduras 
in the second round with an aggregate score of 6-2. Puerto Rico currently 
has a professional league called the Puerto Rico Soccer League which was 
founded in 2008 and is composed of 8 teams. It also had the Puerto Rico 
Islanders, which played in the North American Soccer League, the second 
tier of the American Soccer Pyramid. The team has been defunct since 2012, 
however in June 2015 a new NASL team, Puerto Rico FC, was announced.[26]

swimmer to have been born in Puerto Rico. In 1997, he became the first 
and so far the only Puerto Rican to be inducted into the International 
Swimming Hall of Fame. He currently heads the Puerto Rico Swimming Federation. 
In 1966, 17-year-old Anita Lallande set a new record in the Central American 
and Caribbean Games celebrated in San Juan, when she won a total of 10
