The 1994 Chicago Cubs season was the 123rd season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 119th in the National League and the 79th at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished the shortened season fifth and last in the National League Central 
with a record of 49–64. One of the highlights of the season was Karl "Tuffy" 
Rhodes hitting three home runs on Opening Day[1] - all off Dwight Gooden 
of the New York Mets. The Cubs still lost the game 12-8.[2] Rhodes would 
only hit five more homers that season and the Cubs would set a record by 
losing their first 12 home games.[3] The Cubs finished the strike-shortened 
season with a 49-64 record.[9] They scored 500 runs (4.42 per game) and 
allowed 549 runs (4.86 per game).[10] One of the most-memorable moments 
in Cubs history occurred April 29. 1994, after a heart-breaking 6-5 loss 
to the Colorado Rockies at Wrigley Field.[11] The Cubs loaded the bases 
with one out in the bottom of the ninth only to have Glenallen Hill swing 
at the first pitch he saw and ground into a game-ending double play. The 
loss was the ninth consecutive home defeat for the Cubs to start the season 
and dropped the club to 6-15.[12] Manager Tom Trebelhorn had vowed to meet 
fans outside the ballpark if the Cubs lost another home game and was true 
to his word, wading into a crowd of some 200 angry fans gathered at a fire 
station on Waveland Avenue just outside Wrigley's left-field wall. The 
confrontation started ugly, but within a half hour, Trebelhorn, who was 
known for his quick humor and good nature, won over most of his detractors.[13] 
The team went on to lose three more home games before snapping the record 
streak with a 5-2 win over the Cincinnati Reds on May 4, 1994, but by then 
Trebelhorn's "Firehouse Chat" was a memorable moment in Cubs' history. 
The season, which ended when Major League players went on 1994–95 Major 
League Baseball strike Aug 12, was Trebelhorn's only as manager of the 
Cubs. He was replaced in 1995 by Jim Riggleman. Infielders Coaches Note:
