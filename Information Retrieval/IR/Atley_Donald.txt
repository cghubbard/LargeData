Richard Atley Donald (August 19, 1910 – October 19, 1992) was a Major League 
Baseball pitcher. A native of Morton, Mississippi, the right-hander played 
for the New York Yankees from 1938 to 1945. "Swampy", as he was nicknamed, 
stood 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) and weighed 186 lbs. Donald was usually a fourth 
or fifth starter during his career, and sometimes used in relief. The Yankees 
won two American League pennants while he was on their staff (1941 and 
1942), winning the 1941 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers. He made 
his major league debut on April 21, 1938 in a start against the Boston 
Red Sox at Fenway Park. The Yankees lost 3–2, as Bosox starting pitcher 
Johnny Marcum earned the win. He started in one more game for New York 
that season, then returned to the minor league Newark Bears. Donald was 
back for good in 1939, and set a league record for consecutive wins by 
a rookie. On July 25 he defeated the St. Louis Browns 5–1, increasing his 
record to a perfect 12–0. He finished the season 13–3 with an earned run 
average of 3.71 and led the league in winning percentage (.813). He remained 
a consistent winner throughout the remainder of his career and never had 
a losing season after going 0–1 in 1938. He finished in the league's top 
ten twice more for winning percentage (1941 and 1942) with records of 9–5 
and 11–3, respectively. In two World Series appearances, however, he was 
0–1 with a 7.71 ERA. Beset by eye and elbow injuries and now 34 years old, 
Donald made his last major league appearance on July 13, 1945. His season 
record was 5–4 with the lowest ERA of his career, 2.97. Career totals include 
a 65–33 record (.663) in 153 games pitched, 115 games started, 54 complete 
games, 6 shutouts, 28 games finished, 1 save, and an ERA of 3.52. In 932.1 
innings pitched he struck out 369 and walked 369. He hit .160 in 356 at 
bats with one home run. Donald was a Yankee scout for many years after 
retiring as a player. He played college baseball for Louisiana Tech. He 
died at the age of 82 in West Monroe, Louisiana. Donald scouted New York 
Yankee pitcher Ron Guidry. In 1978, as a rookie, Guidry won 13 consecutive 
games, breaking Donald's American League record of 12 consecutive victories
