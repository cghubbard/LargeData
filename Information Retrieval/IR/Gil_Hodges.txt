As player As manager Gilbert Ray Hodges, ne Hodge[1] (April 4, 1924 – April 
2, 1972) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) first baseman and 
manager who played most of his 18-year career for the Brooklyn and Los 
Angeles Dodgers. He was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 
1982. Hodges is generally considered to be the best defensive first baseman 
in the 1950s. He was an All-Star for eight seasons and a Gold Glove Award 
winner for three consecutive seasons. Hodges and Duke Snider are the only 
players to have the most home runs or runs batted in together during the 
decade with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Hodges was the National League (NL) leader 
in double plays four times and in putouts, assists and fielding percentage 
three times each. He ranked second in NL history with 1,281 assists and 
1,614 double plays when his career ended, and was among the league's career 
leaders in games (6th, 1,908) and total chances (10th, 16,751) at first 
base. Hodges also managed the New York Mets to the 1969 World Series title, 
one of the greatest upsets in Fall Classic history.[2] In 2014, Hodges 
appeared for the second time as a candidate on the National Baseball Hall 
of Fame's Golden Era Committee election ballot[3] for possible Hall of 
Fame consideration in 2015. He and the other candidates all missed getting 
elected.[4] The Committee meets and votes on ten candidates selected from 
the 1947 to 1972 era every three years.[5] Hodges was born in Princeton, 
Indiana, the son of coal miner Charles and his wife Irene, (nee Horstmeyer). 
He had an older brother, Robert, and a younger sister, Marjorie. The family 
moved to nearby Petersburg when Hodges was seven. He was a star four-sport 
athlete at Petersburg High School, earning a combined seven varsity letters 
in football, baseball, basketball and track. He declined a 1941 contract 
offer from the Detroit Tigers, instead attending Saint Joseph's College 
with the hope of eventually becoming a collegiate coach. Hodges spent two 
years (1941–1942 and 1942–1943) at St Joseph's, competing in baseball, 
basketball and briefly in football.[6] He was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers 
in 1943, and appeared in one game for the team as a third baseman that 
year. Hodges entered the United States Marine Corps during World War II 
after having participated in its Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) 
program at Saint Joseph's. He served in combat as an anti-aircraft gunner 
in the battles of Tinian and Okinawa, and received a Bronze Star Medal 
with Combat "V" for heroism under fire. Following the war, Hodges also 
spent time completing course work at Oakland City University, near his 
hometown, playing basketball for the Mighty Oaks, joining the 1947–48 team 
after four games (1–3 record); they finished at 9–10. He was discharged 
from the Marine Corps in 1946, and returned to the Dodgers organization 
as a catcher with the Newport News Dodgers of the Piedmont League, batting 
.278 in 129 games as they won the league championship; his teammates included 
first baseman and future film and television star Chuck Connors. Called 
up to Brooklyn the following year, he played as a catcher in 1947, joining 
the team's nucleus of Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese and Carl Furillo, 
however, with the emergence of Roy Campanella behind the plate, Hodges 
was shifted by manager Leo Durocher to first base. Hodges' only appearance 
in the 1947 World Series against the New York Yankees was as a pinch hitter 
for pitcher Rex Barney in Game seven; he struck out.[7] As a rookie in 
1948, he batted .249 with eleven home runs and seventy RBIs. On June 25, 
1949, he hit for the cycle on his way to his first of seven consecutive 
All-Star teams. For the season, his 115 RBI ranked fourth in the NL, and 
he tied Hack Wilson's 1932 club record for right-handed hitters with 23 
home runs. Defensively, he led the NL in putouts (1,336), double plays 
(142) and fielding average (.995). Facing the Yankees again in the 1949 
Series, he batted only .235 but drove in the sole run in Brooklyn's only 
victory, a 1–0 triumph in game two.[8] In game five, he hit a two out, 
three-run homer in the seventh to pull the Dodgers within 10–6, but struck 
out to end the game and the Series.[9] On August 31, 1950 against the Boston 
Braves, he joined Lou Gehrig as only the second player since 1900 to hit 
four home runs in a game without the benefit of extra innings; he hit them 
against four different pitchers, with the first coming off Warren Spahn. 
He also had seventeen total bases in the game, tied for third in MLB history. 
That year he also led the league in fielding (.994) and set a NL record 
with 159 double plays, breaking Frank McCormick's mark of 153 with the 
1939 Cincinnati Reds; he broke his own record in 1951 with 171, a record 
which stood until Donn Clendenon had 182 for the 1966 Pittsburgh Pirates. 
He finished 1950 third in the league in both homers (32) and RBI (113), 
and came in eighth in the MVP voting. In 1951 he became the first member 
of the Dodgers to ever hit 40 home runs, breaking Babe Herman's 1930 mark 
of 35; Campanella hit 41 in 1953, but Hodges recaptured the record with 
42 in 1954 before Snider eclipsed him again with 43 in 1956. His last home 
run of 1951 came on October 2 against the New York Giants, as the Dodgers 
tied the three-game NL playoff series at a game each with a 10-0 win; New 
York would take the pennant the next day on Bobby Thomson's "Shot Heard 
'Round the World". Hodges also led the NL with 126 assists in 1951, and 
was second in HRs, third in runs (118) and total bases (307), fifth in 
slugging average (.527), and sixth in RBI (103). Hodges was an eight-time 
All-Star, from 1949–55 and in 1957. With his last home run of 1952, he 
tied Dolph Camilli's Dodger career record of 139, surpassing him in 1953; 
Snider moved ahead of Hodges in 1956. He again led the NL with 116 assists 
in the 1952 campaign, and was third in the league in home runs (32) and 
fourth in RBI (102) and slugging (.500). A great fan favorite in Brooklyn, 
he was perhaps the only Dodgers regular never booed at their home park, 
Ebbets Field. Fans were very supportive even when Hodges suffered through 
one of the most famous slumps in baseball history: after going hitless 
in his last four regular-season games of 1952, during the 1952 World Series 
against the Yankees, Hodges went hitless in all seven games, finishing 
the Series 0-for-21 at the plate, and Brooklyn lost the series in seven 
games. When his slump continued into the following spring, fans reacted 
with countless letters and good-luck gifts, and one Brooklyn priest – Father 
Herbert Redmond of St. Francis Roman Catholic Church – told his flock: 
"It's far too hot for a homily. Keep the Commandments and say a prayer 
for Gil Hodges."[10] Hodges began hitting again soon afterward, and rarely 
struggled again in the World Series. Hodges was involved in a blown call 
in the 1952 World Series. In the fifth game, Johnny Sain, batting for the 
Yankees in the 10th inning, grounded out, as ruled by first base umpire 
Art Passarella. The photograph of the play, however, shows Sain stepping 
on first base while Hodges, also with a foot on the bag, reaches for the 
ball, which was about a foot away from his glove. Baseball commissioner 
Ford Frick, an ex-newspaperman himself, refused to defend Passarella. He 
ended 1953 with a .302 batting average, finishing fifth in the NL in RBI 
(122) and sixth in home runs (31). Against the Yankees in the 1953 Series, 
Hodges hit .364; he had three hits, including a homer in the 9-5 Game 1 
loss, but the Dodgers again lost in six games. Under their new manager 
Walter Alston in 1954 Hodges set the team home run record with 42, hitting 
a career-high .304 and again leading the NL in putouts (1,381) and assists 
(132). He was second in the league to Ted Kluszewski in home runs and RBI 
(130), fifth in total bases (335) and sixth in slugging (.579) and runs 
(106), and placed tenth in the MVP vote. The 1955 season saw Hodges' regular-season 
production decline to a .289 average, 27 HRs and 102 RBI. Facing the Yankees 
in the World Series for the fifth time, he was 1-for-12 in the first three 
games before coming around. In Game 4, Hodges hit a two-run homer in the 
fourth inning to put Brooklyn ahead, 4–3, and later had an RBI single as 
they held off the Yankees, 8–5; scoring the first run in his Dodgers 5-3 
win in Game 5. In Game 7, he drove in Campanella with two out in the fourth 
for a 1–0 lead, and added a sacrifice fly to score Reese with one out in 
the sixth. Johnny Podres scattered eight New York hits, and when Reese 
threw Elston Howard's grounder to Hodges for the final out, Brooklyn had 
a 2–0 win and their first World Series title in franchise history, and 
only one in Brooklyn. In 1956, Hodges had 32 home runs and 87 RBI as Brooklyn 
won the pennant again, and once more met the Yankees in the World Series. 
In the third inning of Game 1 he hit a three-run homer to put Brooklyn 
ahead, 5–2, as they went on to a 6-3 win; he had three hits and four RBI 
in Game 2's 13–8 slugfest, scoring to give the Dodgers a 7–6 lead in the 
third and doubling in two runs each in the fourth and fifth innings for 
an 11–7 lead. In Game 5 Hodges struck out, flied to center and lined to 
third base in Yankee Don Larsen's perfect game, as Brooklyn went on to 
lose in seven games. In 1957 Hodges set the NL record for career grand 
slams, breaking the mark of 12 shared by Rogers Hornsby and Ralph Kiner; 
his final total of 14 was tied by Hank Aaron and Willie McCovey in 1972, 
and broken by Aaron in 1974. He finished seventh in the NL with a .299 
batting average and fifth with 98 RBI, and leading the league with 1,317 
putouts. He was also among the NL's top ten players in HRs (27), hits (173), 
runs (94), triples (7), slugging (.511) and total bases (296); in late 
September, he drove in the last Dodgers run ever at Ebbets Field, and the 
last run in Brooklyn history. Hodges was named to his last All-Star team, 
and placed seventh in the MVP balloting. After the Dodgers relocated to 
Los Angeles, on April 23, 1958 Hodges became the seventh player to hit 
300 home runs in the NL, connecting off Dick Drott of the Chicago Cubs. 
That year he also tied a post-1900 record by leading the league in double 
plays (134) for the fourth time, equaling Frank McCormick and Ted Kluszewski; 
Donn Clendenon eventually broke the record in 1968. Hodges' totals were 
22 HRs and 64 RBI as the Dodgers finished in seventh place in their first 
season in California. Also in 1958, he broke Dolph Camilli's NL record 
of 923 career strikeouts. In 1959, the Dodgers captured another NL title, 
with Hodges contributing 25 HRs and 80 RBI and hitting .276, coming in 
seventh in the league with a .513 slugging mark; he also led the NL with 
a .992 fielding average. He batted .391 in the 1959 World Series against 
the Chicago White Sox (his first against a team other than the Yankees), 
with his solo home run in the eighth inning of Game 4 giving the Dodgers 
a 5–4 win, as they triumphed in six games for another Series championship. 
In 1960, Hodges broke Kiner's NL record for right-handed hitters of 351 
career home runs, and appeared on the TV program Home Run Derby. In his 
last season with the Dodgers in 1961, he became the team's career RBI leader 
with 1,254, passing Zack Wheat; Snider moved ahead of him the following 
year. Hodges received the first three Rawlings Gold Glove Awards presented, 
from 1957 to 1959. After being chosen in the 1961 MLB Expansion Draft, 
Hodges was one of the original 1962 Mets and despite knee problems was 
persuaded to continue his playing career in New York, hitting the first 
home run in franchise history. By the end of the year, in which he played 
only 54 games, he ranked tenth in MLB history with 370 HRs – second to 
only Jimmie Foxx among right-handed hitters. He also held the National 
League (NL) record for career home runs by a right-handed hitter from 1960 
to 1963, and held the NL record for career grand slams from 1957 to 1974.[11] 
After 11 games with the Mets in 1963, during which he batted .227 with 
no homers and was plagued by injuries, he was traded to the Washington 
Senators in late May for outfielder Jimmy Piersall so that he could replace 
Mickey Vernon as Washington's manager. Hodges immediately announced his 
retirement from playing in order to clearly focus on his new position. 
The Giants' Willie Mays had passed him weeks earlier on April 19 to become 
the NL's home run leader among right-handed hitters; Hodges' last game 
had been on May 5 in a doubleheader hosting the Giants (who had moved to 
San Francisco in 1958). Hodges managed the Senators through 1967, and although 
they improved in each season they never achieved a winning record. One 
of the most notable incidents in his career occurred in the summer of 1965, 
when pitcher Ryne Duren – reaching the end of his career and sinking into 
alcoholism – walked onto a bridge with intentions of suicide; his manager 
talked him away from the edge. In 1968 Hodges was brought back to manage 
the perennially woeful Mets, and while the team only posted a 73–89 record 
it was nonetheless the best mark in their seven years of existence up to 
that point. In 1969, he led the "Miracle Mets" to the World Series championship, 
defeating the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles; after losing Game 1, they 
came back for four straight victories, including two by 2–1 scores. Finishing 
higher than ninth place for the first time, the Mets became not only the 
first expansion team to win a World Series, but also the first team ever 
to win the Fall Classic after finishing at least 15 games under .500 the 
previous year. Hodges was named The Sporting News' Manager of the Year, 
in skillfully platooning his players, utilizing everyone in the dugout, 
keeping everyone fresh.[citation needed] In the third inning of the second 
game of a July 30 doubleheader against the Houston Astros, after scoring 
11 runs in the ninth inning of the first game, the Astros were in the midst 
of a ten-run third inning, hitting a number of line drives to left field. 
When the Mets' star left fielder Cleon Jones failed to hustle after a ball 
hit to the outfield, Hodges removed him from the game, but rather than 
simply signal from the dugout for Jones to come out, or delegate the job 
to one of his coaches, Hodges left the dugout and slowly, deliberately, 
walked all the way out to left field to remove Jones, and walked him back 
to the dugout, which was a resounding message to the whole team. For the 
rest of that season, Jones never failed again to hustle. Kiner retold that 
story dozens of times during Mets broadcasts, both as a tribute to Hodges, 
and as an illustration of his quiet but disciplined character.[citation 
needed] On the afternoon of April 2, 1972, Hodges was in West Palm Beach, 
Florida completing a round of golf with Mets coaches Joe Pignatano, Rube 
Walker and Eddie Yost when he collapsed en route to his motel room at the 
Ramada Inn across the street from Municipal Stadium, then the home of the 
Atlanta Braves and Montreal Expos. Hodges had suffered a sudden heart attack 
and was rushed to Good Samaritan Hospital where he died within 20 minutes 
of arrival.[12] Pignatano later recalled Hodges falling backwards and hitting 
his head on the sidewalk with a "sickening knock", bleeding profusely and 
turning blue.[13] Pignatano said "I put my hand under Gil's head, but before 
you knew it, the blood stopped. I knew he was dead. He died in my arms."[13] 
A lifelong chain smoker, Hodges had suffered a minor heart attack during 
a September 1968 game.[14] The entire baseball community was horribly shocked 
and totally devastated at the sudden loss of one of baseball's most beloved 
players. A symbol of Brooklyn, many former teammates grieved at the loss 
of Hodges. Jackie Robinson, himself ill with heart disease and diabetes, 
told the Associated Press, "He was the core of the Brooklyn Dodgers.[13] 
With this, and what's happened to Campy (Roy Campanella) and lot of other 
guys we played with, it scares you. I've been somewhat shocked by it all. 
I have tremendous feelings for Gil's family and kids." Robinson himself 
died of a heart attack only six months later on October 24, 1972 at age 
53.[12] Duke Snider said "Gil was a great player, but an even greater man."[13] 
"I'm sick", said Johnny Podres. "I've never known a finer man."[13] A crushed 
Carl Erskine said "Gil's death is like a bolt out of the blue."[13] Don 
Drysdale, who himself died in Montreal of a sudden heart attack in 1993 
at age 56, wrote in his autobiography that Hodges' death "absolutely shattered 
me. I just flew apart. I didn't leave my apartment in Texas for three days. 
I didn't want to see anybody. I couldn't get myself to go to the funeral. 
It was like I'd lost a part of my family."[13] The wake was held at Our 
Lady Help of Christians Church in Midwood, Brooklyn on April 4, what would 
have been Hodges' 48th birthday. It was later estimated approximately 10,000 
mourners had attended.[13] Television broadcaster Howard Cosell was one 
of the many attendees at the wake. According to Gil Hodges Jr., Cosell 
brought him into the back seat of a car, where Jackie Robinson had been 
crying hysterically. Robinson then held Hodges Jr. and said, "Next to my 
son's death, this is the worst day of my life."[13] Hodges was survived 
by his wife, the former Joan Lombardi (born 1926 in Brooklyn), whom he 
had married on December 26, 1948, and their children Gil Jr. (born March 
12, 1950), Irene, Cynthia and Barbara. He is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery 
in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. Yogi Berra succeeded him as manager, having 
been promoted on the day of the funeral.[13] The American flag flew at 
half-staff on Opening Day at Shea Stadium, while the Mets wore black armbands 
on their left arms during the entire 1972 season in honor of Hodges. On 
June 9, 1973, the Mets again honored Hodges by retiring his uniform number 
14.[13] Hodges batted .273 in his career with a .487 slugging average, 
1,921 hits, 1,274 RBI, 1,105 runs, 295 doubles and 63 stolen bases in 2,071 
games. His 361 home runs with the Dodgers remain second in team history 
to Snider's 389. His 1,614 career double plays placed him behind only Charlie 
Grimm (1733) in NL history, and were a major league record for a right-handed 
fielding first baseman until Chris Chambliss surpassed him in 1984. His 
1,281 career assists ranked second in league history to Fred Tenney's 1,363, 
and trailed only Ed Konetchy's 1,292 among all right-handed first basemen. 
Snider broke his NL record of 1,137 career strikeouts in 1964. Hodges received 
New York City's highest civilian honor, the Bronze Medallion, in 1969. 
On April 4, 1978 (what would have been Hodges' 54th birthday), the Marine 
Parkway Bridge, connecting Marine Park, Brooklyn with Rockaway, Queens, 
was renamed the Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge in his memory.[13] 
Other Brooklyn locations named for him are a park on Carroll Street, a 
Little League field on Shell Road in Brooklyn, a section of Avenue L and 
P.S. 193. In addition, part of Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn is named Gil 
Hodges Way. A Brooklyn bowling alley, Gil Hodges Lanes, is also named after 
him. Hodges was also inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1982. 
In Indiana, the high school baseball stadium in his birthplace of Princeton 
and a bridge spanning the East Fork of the White River in northern Pike 
County on State Road 57 bear his name. In 2007, Hodges was inducted into 
the Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame.[15] A Petersburg Little League baseball 
team also bears his name, Hodges Dodgers. There has been continuing controversy 
for decades over the fact Gil Hodges has not been elected to membership 
in the Baseball Hall of Fame.[16] He was considered to be one of the finest 
players of the 1950s,[13] and graduated to managerial success with the 
Mets. However, critics of his candidacy point out that despite his offensive 
prowess, he never led the National League in any offensive category such 
as home runs, RBI, or slugging average, and never came close to winning 
an MVP award.[16] Hodges' not having been voted a Most Valuable Player 
may have been based in part on his having had some of his best seasons 
(1950, 1954 and 1957) in years when the Dodgers did not win the pennant.[16] 
Another thing that has probably hurt his Hall of Fame candidacy was the 
fact he went hitless in the 1952 World Series, going 0 for 21 with just 
one run scored and one batted in. In addition, his career batting average 
of .273 was likely frowned on by many Hall of Fame voters in his early 
years of eligibility; at the time of his death, only five players had ever 
been elected by the Baseball Writers' Association of America with batting 
averages below .300 – all of them catchers or shortstops, and only one 
(Rabbit Maranville) who had an average lower than Hodges' or who had not 
won an MVP award. By the time his initial eligibility expired in 1983, 
the BBWAA had elected only two more players with averages below .274 – 
third basemen Eddie Mathews (.271), who hit over 500 HRs, leading the NL 
twice, and Brooks Robinson (.267), who won an MVP award and set numerous 
defensive records. In Hodges' defense, however, it bears mentioning that 
numerous other players, including Mathews, Al Kaline, Billy Williams and 
Eddie Murray, have been elected to the Hall of Fame despite never having 
been voted Most Valuable Player. Others, most notably Tony Pérez and Barry 
Larkin, have been elected despite never having led their leagues in any 
important offensive category in a season. (Perez, like Hodges, also was 
never voted Most Valuable Player, and his overall career statistics are 
very similar to Hodges'.) While Hodges did post some of his best season 
performances in years in which the Dodgers failed to win the pennant, he 
was nevertheless a significant contributor for the Dodgers in the seasons 
in which they did win pennants, as well. His contributions to the Dodgers' 
successful 1949, 1953, 1955 and 1959 campaigns are particularly noteworthy. 
With regard to Hodges' 1952 World Series slump, several Hall of Fame honorees, 
among them Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Stan Musial and Ted Williams, also endured 
severe batting slumps in World Series play. More to the point, Hodges' 
failure in the 1952 World Series does not obscure his fine performances 
for the Dodgers in the other World Series they played during his tenure 
with the club. Hodges led the Dodger hitters in the 1953 World Series, 
posting a batting average of .364. Hodges' .304 mark in the 1956 Series 
earned him a tie with Duke Snider for the top Dodgers batting average, 
while his eight Series RBI were good enough for the outright lead among 
Dodgers hitters in that department. Hodges shared top hitting honors for 
all starting position players on both teams in the 1959 Fall Classic with 
Chicago's Ted Kluszewski, both first basemen hitting at a .391 clip. He 
also drove in both runs in the Dodgers' decisive 2-0 victory in the seventh 
game of the 1955 Series, which brought Brooklyn its first (and only) World 
Series title. Hodges was the prototype of the modern slugging first baseman, 
and while the post-1961 expansion era has resulted in numerous players 
surpassing his home run and RBI totals, he remains the only one of the 
21 players who had 300 or more home runs by the time of his retirement 
who has not yet been elected (all but Chuck Klein and Johnny Mize were 
elected by the BBWAA). Some observers have also suggested that his death 
in 1972 removed him from public consciousness, whereas other ballplayers 
– including numerous Dodger greats – were in the public eye for years afterward, 
receiving the exposure which assist in their election. He did, however, 
collect 3,010 votes cast by the BBWAA during his initial eligibility period 
from 1969 to 1983 – 2nd place for an unselected player, he was passed by 
Jack Morris in 2014 when he collected 351 votes to push his total to 3,324. 
Hodges who was regularly considered for selection by the Hall of Fame's 
Veterans Committee since 1987, falling one vote short of election in 1993, 
when no candidates were selected. In the years since Hodges' retirement, 
however, the Hall of Fame has refused admittance to many players with similar 
or even superior records.[16] In 2011, Hodges became a Golden Era candidate 
(1947 to 1972 era) for consideration to be elected to the Hall of Fame 
by the new Golden Era Committee (replaced the Veterans Committee in 2010) 
on December 5, 2011. The voting by the committee took place during the 
Hall of Fame's 2-day winter meeting in Dallas, Texas.[16] Ron Santo was 
the only one elected of the ten Golden Era candidates with 15 votes, Jim 
Kaat had 10 votes, and Hodges and Minnie Miñoso were tied with 9 votes. 
Hodges' next chance under the 16-member Golden Era Committee's electorates 
was on December 8, 2014, when the committee voted at the MLB Winter Meeting.[17] 
Hodges received only 3 votes, and none of the other eight player candidates 
on the ballot were elected to the Hall of Fame either, including Dick Allen 
and Tony Oliva, who both received 11 of the needed 12 votes for Hall of 
Fame induction in 2015. A 52 ft.x16ft. mural was dedicated in Hodges' hometown 
of Petersburg, Indiana in 2009; it was painted by artist Randy Hedden and 
includes pictures of Hodges as Brooklyn Dodger, manager of the New York 
Mets, and batting at Ebbets Field. The mural, located at the intersection 
of state highways 61 and 57, is meant to "raise awareness of Hodges' absence
