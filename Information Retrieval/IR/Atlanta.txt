Atlanta is the capital of and the most populous city in the U.S. state 
of Georgia, with an estimated 2015 population of 463,878.[6] Atlanta is 
the cultural and economic center of the Atlanta metropolitan area, home 
to 5,522,942 people and the ninth largest metropolitan area in the United 
States.[7] Atlanta is the county seat of Fulton County, and a small portion 
of the city extends eastward into DeKalb County. Atlanta was established 
in 1837 at the intersection of two railroad lines, and the city rose from 
the ashes of the American Civil War to become a national center of commerce. 
In the decades following the Civil Rights Movement, during which the city 
earned a reputation as "too busy to hate" for the relatively progressive 
views of some of its citizens and leaders compared to other cities in the 
Deep South[13] Atlanta attained international prominence. Atlanta is the 
primary transportation hub of the Southeastern United States, via highway, 
railroad, and air, with Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport 
being the world's busiest airport since 1998.[14][15][16][17] Atlanta is 
an "alpha-" or "world city",[18] exerting a significant impact upon commerce, 
finance, research, technology, education, media, art, and entertainment. 
It ranks 36th among world cities and 8th in the nation with a gross domestic 
product of $270 billion.[19] Atlanta's economy is considered diverse, with 
dominant sectors including logistics, professional and business services, 
media operations, and information technology.[20] Topographically, Atlanta 
is marked by rolling hills and dense tree coverage.[21] Revitalization 
of Atlanta's neighborhoods, initially spurred by the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, 
has intensified in the 21st century, altering the city's demographics, 
politics, and culture.[22][23] Prior to the arrival of European settlers 
in north Georgia, Creek Indians inhabited the area.[24] Standing Peachtree, 
a Creek village located where Peachtree Creek flows into the Chattahoochee 
River, was the closest Indian settlement to what is now Atlanta.[25] As 
part of the systematic removal of Native Americans from northern Georgia 
from 1802 to 1825,[26] the Creek ceded the area in 1821,[27] and white 
settlers arrived the following year.[28] In 1836, the Georgia General Assembly 
voted to build the Western and Atlantic Railroad in order to provide a 
link between the port of Savannah and the Midwest.[29] The initial route 
was to run southward from Chattanooga to a terminus east of the Chattahoochee 
River, which would then be linked to Savannah. After engineers surveyed 
various possible locations for the terminus, the "zero milepost" was driven 
into the ground in what is now Five Points. A year later, the area around 
the milepost had developed into a settlement, first known as "Terminus", 
and later as "Thrasherville" after a local merchant who built homes and 
a general store in the area.[30] By 1842, the town had six buildings and 
30 residents, and was renamed "Marthasville" to honor the Governor's daughter.[31] 
J. Edgar Thomson, Chief Engineer of the Georgia Railroad, suggested the 
town be renamed "Atlantica-Pacifica," which was shortened to "Atlanta".[31] 
The residents approved, and the town was incorporated as Atlanta on December 
29, 1847.[32] By 1860, Atlanta's population had grown to 9,554.[33][34] 
During the Civil War, the nexus of multiple railroads in Atlanta made the 
city a hub for the distribution of military supplies. In 1864, following 
the capture of Chattanooga, the Union Army moved southward and began its 
invasion of north Georgia. The region surrounding Atlanta was the location 
of several major army battles, culminating with the Battle of Atlanta and 
a four-month-long siege of the city by the Union Army under the command 
of General William Tecumseh Sherman. On September 1, 1864, Confederate 
General John Bell Hood made the decision to retreat from Atlanta, ordering 
all public buildings and possible assets to the Union Army destroyed. On 
the next day, Mayor James Calhoun surrendered Atlanta to the Union Army, 
and on September 7, General Sherman ordered the city's civilian population 
to evacuate. On November 11, 1864, in preparation of the Union Army's march 
to Savannah, Sherman ordered Atlanta to be burned to the ground, sparing 
only the city's churches and hospitals.[35] After the Civil War ended in 
1865, Atlanta was gradually rebuilt. Due to the city's superior rail transportation 
network, the state capital was moved to Atlanta from Milledgeville in 1868.[36] 
In the 1880 Census, Atlanta surpassed Savannah as Georgia's largest city. 
Beginning in the 1880s, Henry W. Grady, the editor of the Atlanta Constitution 
newspaper, promoted Atlanta to potential investors as a city of the "New 
South" that would be based upon a modern economy and less reliant on agriculture. 
By 1885, the founding of the Georgia School of Technology (now Georgia 
Tech) and the city's black colleges had established Atlanta as a center 
for higher education. In 1895, Atlanta hosted the Cotton States and International 
Exposition, which attracted nearly 800,000 attendees and successfully promoted 
the New South's development to the world.[37] During the first decades 
of the 20th century, Atlanta experienced a period of unprecedented growth. 
In three decades' time, Atlanta's population tripled as the city limits 
expanded to include nearby streetcar suburbs; the city's skyline emerged 
with the construction of the Equitable, Flatiron, Empire, and Candler buildings; 
and Sweet Auburn emerged as a center of black commerce. However, the period 
was also marked by strife and tragedy. Increased racial tensions led to 
the Atlanta Race Riot of 1906, which left at least 27 people dead and over 
70 injured.[38] In 1915, Leo Frank, a Jewish-American factory superintendent, 
convicted of murder, was hanged in Marietta by a lynch mob, drawing attention 
to antisemitism in the United States.[39] On May 21, 1917, the Great Atlanta 
Fire destroyed 1,938 buildings in what is now the Old Fourth Ward, resulting 
in one fatality and the displacement of 10,000 people. On December 15, 
1939, Atlanta hosted the film premiere of Gone with the Wind, the epic 
film based on the best-selling novel by Atlanta's Margaret Mitchell. The 
film's legendary producer, David O. Selznick, as well as the film's stars 
Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, and Olivia de Havilland attended the gala event 
at Loew's Grand Theatre, but Oscar winner Hattie McDaniel, an African American, 
was barred from the event due to racial segregation laws and policies.[40] 
Atlanta played a vital role in the Allied effort during World War II due 
the city's war-related manufacturing companies, railroad network, and military 
bases, leading to rapid growth in the city's population and economy. In 
the 1950s, the city's newly constructed freeway system allowed middle class 
Atlantans the ability to relocate to the suburbs. As a result, the city 
began to make up an ever-smaller proportion of the metropolitan area's 
population.[41] During the 1960s, Atlanta was a major organizing center 
of the Civil Rights Movement, with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Ralph David 
Abernathy, and students from Atlanta's historically black colleges and 
universities playing major roles in the movement's leadership. While minimal 
compared to other cities, Atlanta was not completely free of racial strife.[42] 
In 1961, the city attempted to thwart blockbusting by erecting road barriers 
in Cascade Heights, countering the efforts of civic and business leaders 
to foster Atlanta as the "city too busy to hate".[42][43] Desegregation 
of the public sphere came in stages, with public transportation desegregated 
by 1959,[44] the restaurant at Rich's department store by 1961,[45] movie 
theaters by 1963,[46][47] and public schools by 1973.[48] In 1960, whites 
comprised 61.7% of the city's population.[49] By 1970, African Americans 
were a majority of the city's population and exercised new-found political 
influence by electing Atlanta's first black mayor, Maynard Jackson, in 
1973. Under Mayor Jackson's tenure, Atlanta's airport was modernized, solidifying 
the city's role as a transportation center. The opening of the Georgia 
World Congress Center in 1976 heralded Atlanta's rise as a convention city.[50] 
Construction of the city's subway system began in 1975, with rail service 
commencing in 1979.[51] However, despite these improvements, Atlanta lost 
over 100,000 residents between 1970 and 1990, over 20% of its population.[52] 
In 1990, Atlanta was selected as the site for the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. 
Following the announcement, the city government undertook several major 
construction projects to improve Atlanta's parks, sporting venues, and 
transportation infrastructure. While the games themselves were marred by 
numerous organizational inefficiencies, as well as the Centennial Olympic 
Park bombing,[53] they were a watershed event in Atlanta's history, initiating 
a fundamental transformation of the city in the decade that followed.[52] 
During the 2000s, Atlanta underwent a profound transformation demographically, 
physically, and culturally. Suburbanization, a booming economy, and new 
migrants decreased the city's black percentage from a high of 67% in 1990 
to 54% in 2010.[54][55] From 2000 to 2010, Atlanta gained 22,763 white 
residents, 5,142 Asian residents, and 3,095 Hispanic residents, while the 
city's black population decreased by 31,678.[56][57] Much of the city's 
demographic change during the decade was driven by young, college-educated 
professionals: from 2000 to 2009, the three-mile radius surrounding Downtown 
Atlanta gained 9,722 residents aged 25 to 34 holding at least a four-year 
degree, an increase of 61%.[58][59] Between the mid-1990s and 2010, stimulated 
by funding from the HOPE VI program, Atlanta demolished nearly all of its 
public housing, a total of 17,000 units and about 10% of all housing units 
in the city.[60][61][62] In 2005, the $2.8 billion BeltLine project was 
adopted, with the stated goals of converting a disused 22-mile freight 
railroad loop that surrounds the central city into an art-filled multi-use 
trail and increasing the city's park space by 40%.[63] Lastly, Atlanta's 
cultural offerings expanded during the 2000s: the High Museum of Art doubled 
in size; the Alliance Theatre won a Tony Award; and numerous art galleries 
were established on the once-industrial Westside.[64] Atlanta encompasses 
134.0 square miles (347.1 km2), of which 133.2 square miles (344.9 km2) 
is land and 0.85 square miles (2.2 km2) is water.[65] The city is situated 
among the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, and at 1,050 feet (320 m) 
above mean sea level, Atlanta has the highest elevation of major cities 
east of the Mississippi River.[66] Atlanta straddles the Eastern Continental 
Divide, such that rainwater that falls on the south and east side of the 
divide flows into the Atlantic Ocean, while rainwater on the north and 
west side of the divide flows into the Gulf of Mexico.[67] Atlanta sits 
atop a ridge south of the Chattahoochee River, which is part of the ACF 
River Basin. Located at the far northwestern edge of the city, much of 
the river's natural habitat is preserved, in part by the Chattahoochee 
River National Recreation Area.[68] Most of Atlanta was burned during the 
Civil War, depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture. 
Yet architecturally, the city had never been particularly "southern"—because 
Atlanta originated as a railroad town, rather than a patrician southern 
seaport like Savannah or Charleston, many of the city's landmarks could 
have easily been erected in the Northeast or Midwest.[21] During the Cold 
War era, Atlanta embraced global modernist trends, especially regarding 
commercial and institutional architecture. Examples of modernist architecture 
include the 1,196,240sq.ft[69] Westin Peachtree Plaza (1976), Georgia-Pacific 
Tower (1982), the State of Georgia Building (1966), and the Atlanta Marriott 
Marquis (1985). In the latter half of the 1980s, Atlanta became one of 
the early adopters of postmodern designs that reintroduced classical elements 
to the cityscape. Many of Atlanta's tallest skyscrapers were built in the 
late 1980s and early 1990s, with most displaying tapering spires or otherwise 
ornamented crowns, such as the 1,187,676 sq.ft[70]One Atlantic Center (1987), 
191 Peachtree Tower (1991), and the Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta (1992). 
Also completed during the era is Atlanta's tallest skyscraper, the Bank 
of America Plaza (1992), which, at 1,023 feet (312 m), is the 61st-tallest 
building in the world and the 9th-tallest building in the United States. 
The Bank of America Plaza is the tallest building outside of New York City 
and Chicago, and was the last building built in the United States to be 
in the top 10 tallest buildings in the world until One World Trade Center 
was completed externally in May 2013.[71] The city's embrace of modern 
architecture, however, translated into an ambivalent approach toward historic 
preservation, leading to the destruction of notable architectural landmarks, 
including the Equitable Building (1892–1971), Terminal Station (1905–1972), 
and the Carnegie Library (1902–1977). The Fox Theatre (1929)—Atlanta's 
cultural icon—would have met the same fate had it not been for a grassroots 
effort to save it in the mid-1970s.[21] Atlanta is divided into 242 officially 
defined neighborhoods.[72][73][74] The city contains three major high-rise 
districts, which form a north-south axis along Peachtree: Downtown, Midtown, 
and Buckhead.[75] Surrounding these high-density districts are leafy, low-density 
neighborhoods, most of which are dominated by single-family homes.[76] 
Downtown Atlanta contains the most office space in the metro area, much 
of it occupied by government entities. Downtown is also home to the city's 
sporting venues and many of its tourist attractions. Midtown Atlanta is 
the city's second-largest business district, containing the offices of 
many of the region's law firms. Midtown is also known for its art institutions, 
cultural attractions, institutions of higher education, and dense form.[77] 
Buckhead, the city's uptown district, is eight miles (13 km) north of Downtown 
and the city's third-largest business district. The district is marked 
by an urbanized core along Peachtree Road, surrounded by suburban single-family 
neighborhoods situated among dense forests and rolling hills.[78] Surrounding 
Atlanta's three high-rise districts are the city's low- and medium-density 
neighborhoods,[78] where the craftsman bungalow single-family home is dominant.[79] 
The eastside is marked by historic streetcar suburbs built from the 1890s-1930s 
as havens for the upper middle class. These neighborhoods, many of which 
contain their own villages encircled by shaded, architecturally-distinct 
residential streets, include the Victorian Inman Park, Bohemian East Atlanta, 
and eclectic Old Fourth Ward.[21][80] On the westside, former warehouses 
and factories have been converted into housing, retail space, and art galleries, 
transforming the once-industrial West Midtown into a model neighborhood 
for smart growth, historic rehabilitation, and infill construction.[81] 
In southwest Atlanta, neighborhoods closer to downtown originated as streetcar 
suburbs, including the historic West End, while those farther from downtown 
retain a postwar suburban layout, including Collier Heights and Cascade 
Heights, home to much of the city's affluent African American population.[82][83][84] 
Northwest Atlanta contains the areas of the city to west of Marietta Boulevard 
and to the north of Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive, including those neighborhoods 
remote to downtown, such as Riverside, Bolton and Whittier Mill, which 
is one of Atlanta's designated Landmark Historical Neighborhoods. Vine 
City, though technically Northwest, adjoins the city's Downtown area and 
has recently been the target of community outreach programs and economic 
development initiatives.[85] Gentrification of the city's neighborhoods 
is one of the more controversial and transformative forces shaping contemporary 
Atlanta. The gentrification of Atlanta has its origins in the 1970s, after 
many of Atlanta's neighborhoods had undergone the urban decay that affected 
other major American cities in the mid-20th century. When neighborhood 
opposition successfully prevented two freeways from being built through 
city's the east side in 1975, the area became the starting point for Atlanta's 
gentrification. After Atlanta was awarded the Olympic games in 1990, gentrification 
expanded into other parts of the city, stimulated by infrastructure improvements 
undertaken in preparation for the games. Gentrification was also aided 
by the Atlanta Housing Authority's eradication of the city's public housing.[86] 
Under the Köppen classification, Atlanta has a humid subtropical climate 
(Cfa) with four distinct seasons and generous precipitation year-round, 
typical for the inland South. Summers are hot and humid, with temperatures 
somewhat moderated by the city's elevation. Winters are cool but variable, 
with an average of 48 freezing days per year[87] and temperatures dropping 
to 0 °F (−17.8 °C) on rare occasions.[88][89] Warm air from the Gulf of 
Mexico can bring spring-like highs while strong Arctic air masses can push 
lows into the teens (≤ −7 °C). July averages 80.2 °F (26.8 °C), with high 
temperatures reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 44 days per year, though 
100 °F (38 °C) readings are not seen most years. January averages 43.5 °F 
(6.4 °C), with temperatures in the suburbs slightly cooler due largely 
to the urban heat island effect. Lows at or below freezing can be expected 
40 nights annually,[90] but extended stretches with daily high temperatures 
below 40 °F (4 °C) are very rare, with a recent exception in January 2014. 
Extremes range from −9 °F (−23 °C) on February 13, 1899 to 106 °F (41 °C) 
on June 30, 2012.[91] Dewpoints in the summer range from 63.6 °F (18 °C) 
in June to 67.8 °F (20 °C) in July. Typical of the southeastern U.S., Atlanta 
receives abundant rainfall that is relatively evenly distributed throughout 
the year, though spring and early fall are markedly drier. The average 
annual rainfall is 50.2 inches (1,280 mm), while snowfall is typically 
light at around 2.1 inches (5.3 cm) per year.[92] The heaviest single snowfall 
occurred on January 23, 1940, with around 10 inches (25 cm) of snow.[93] 
However, ice storms usually cause more problems than snowfall does, the 
most severe occurring on January 7, 1973. Tornadoes are rare in the city 
itself, but the March 15, 2008 EF2 tornado damaged prominent structures 
in downtown Atlanta. The 2010 United States Census reported that Atlanta 
had a population of 420,003. The population density was 3,154 per square 
mile (1232/km2). The racial makeup and population of Atlanta was 54.0% 
Black or African American, 38.4% White, 3.1% Asian and 0.2% Native American. 
Those from some other race made up 2.2% of the city's population, while 
those from two or more races made up 2.0%. Hispanics of any race made up 
5.2% of the city's population.[102][103][104][105] The median income for 
a household in the city was $45,171. The per capita income for the city 
was $35,453. 22.6% percent of the population was living below the poverty 
line. However, compared to the rest of the country, Atlanta's cost of living 
is 6.00% lower than the U.S. average. Atlanta has one of the highest LGBT 
populations per capita, ranking third among major American cities, behind 
San Francisco and slightly behind Seattle, with 12.8% of the city's total 
population identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.[106][107] 7.3% of 
Atlantans were born abroad.[108] In the 2010 Census, Atlanta was recorded 
as the nation's fourth-largest majority-black city. It has long been known 
as a center of African-American political power, education, and culture, 
often called a black mecca.[109][110][111] African-American residents of 
Atlanta have followed whites to newer housing in the suburbs in the early 
21st century. From 2000 to 2010, the city's black population decreased 
by 31,678 people, shrinking from 61.4% of the city's population in 2000 
to 54.0% in 2010.[56][112] At the same time, the white population of Atlanta 
has increased. Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of whites in the city's 
population grew faster than that of any other U.S. city. In that decade, 
Atlanta's white population grew from 31% to 38% of the city's population, 
an absolute increase of 22,753 people, more than triple the increase that 
occurred between 1990 and 2000.[56][112][113] Out of the total population 
five years and older, 83.3% spoke only English at home, while 8.8% spoke 
Spanish, 3.9% another Indo-European language, and 2.8% an Asian language.[114] 
Atlanta's dialect has traditionally been a variation of Southern American 
English. The Chattahoochee River long formed a border between the Coastal 
Southern and Southern Appalachian dialects.[115] Because of the development 
of corporate headquarters in the region, attracting migrants from other 
areas of the country, by 2003, Atlanta magazine concluded that Atlanta 
had become significantly "de-Southernized." A Southern accent was considered 
a handicap in some circumstances.[116] In general, Southern accents are 
less prevalent among residents of the city and inner suburbs and among 
younger people; they are more common in the outer suburbs and among older 
people.[115] At the same time, residents of the city express Southern variations 
of African American Vernacular English. Religion in Atlanta, while historically 
centered on Protestant Christianity, now involves many faiths as a result 
of the city and metro area's increasingly international population. Protestant 
Christianity still maintains a strong presence in the city (63%),[117][118] 
but in recent decades the Catholic Church has increased in numbers and 
influence because of new migrants in the region. Metro Atlanta also has 
numerous ethnic or national Christian congregations, including Korean and 
Indian churches. The larger non-Christian faiths are Judaism, Islam and 
Hinduism. Overall, there are over 1,000 places of worship within Atlanta.[119] 
Encompassing $304 billion, the Atlanta metropolitan area is the eighth-largest 
economy in the country and 17th-largest in the world.[120] Corporate operations 
comprise a large portion of the Atlanta's economy, with the city serving 
as the regional, national, or global headquarters for many corporations. 
Atlanta contains the country's third largest concentration of Fortune 500 
companies, and the city is the global headquarters of corporations such 
as The Coca-Cola Company, The Home Depot, Delta Air Lines, AT&T Mobility, 
Chick-fil-A, UPS, and Newell-Rubbermaid. Over 75 percent of Fortune 1000 
companies conduct business operations in the Atlanta metropolitan area, 
and the region hosts offices of about 1,250 multinational corporations.[121] 
Many corporations are drawn to Atlanta on account of the city's educated 
workforce; as of 2014[update], 45% of adults 25 or older in the city of 
Atlanta have at least 4-year college degrees, compared to 28% in the nation 
as a whole.[122][123][124] Atlanta began as a railroad town and logistics 
has remained a major component of the city's economy to this day. Atlanta 
is an important rail junction and contains major classification yards for 
Norfolk Southern and CSX. Since its construction in the 1950s, Hartsfield-Jackson 
Atlanta International Airport has served as a key engine of Atlanta's economic 
growth.[125] Delta Air Lines, the city's largest employer and the metro 
area's third largest, operates the world's largest airline hub at Hartsfield-Jackson 
and has helped make it the world's busiest airport, both in terms of passenger 
traffic and aircraft operations.[126] Partly due to the airport, Atlanta 
has become a hub for diplomatic missions; as of 2012[update], the city 
contains 25 general consulates, the seventh-highest concentration of diplomatic 
missions in the United States.[127] Media is also an important aspect of 
Atlanta's economy. The city is a major cable television programming center. 
Ted Turner established the headquarters of both the Cable News Network 
(CNN) and the Turner Broadcasting System (TBS) in Atlanta. Cox Enterprises, 
the country's third-largest cable television service and the publisher 
of over a dozen major American newspapers,[128] is headquartered in the 
city.[129][130][131] The Weather Channel, owned by NBCUniversal, Bain Capital, 
and The Blackstone Group, is headquartered just outside Atlanta in Cobb 
County. Information technology, an economic sector that includes publishing, 
software development, entertainment and data processing has garnered a 
larger percentage of Atlanta's economic output. Indeed, Atlanta has been 
nicknamed the Silicon peach due to its burgeoning technology sector. As 
of 2013[update], Atlanta contains the fourth-largest concentration of information 
technology jobs in the United States, numbering 85,000. Atlanta also ranks 
as the sixth fastest-growing city for information technology jobs, with 
an employment growth of 4.8% in 2012 and a three-year growth near 9%, or 
16,000 jobs. Information technology companies are drawn to Atlanta's lower 
costs and educated workforce.[132][133][134][135] Largely due to a statewide 
tax incentive enacted in 2005, the Georgia Entertainment Industry Investment 
Act, which awards qualified productions a transferable income tax credit 
of 20% of all in-state costs for film and television investments of $500,000 
or more,[136] Atlanta has become a center for film and television production. 
Film and television production facilities in Atlanta include Turner Studios, 
Pinewood Studios (Pinewood Atlanta), Tyler Perry Studios, Williams Street 
Productions, and the EUE/Screen Gems soundstages. Film and television production 
injected $6 billion into Georgia's economy in 2015, with Atlanta garnering 
most of the projects.[137] Atlanta has gained recognition as a center of 
production of horror and zombie-related productions,[138] with Atlanta 
magazine dubbing the city the "Zombie Capital of the World".[139][140] 
Compared to other American cities, Atlanta's economy has been disproportionately 
affected by the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession, with the 
city's economy earning a ranking of 68 among 100 American cities in a September 
2014 report due to an elevated unemployment rate, declining real income 
levels, and a depressed housing market.[141][142][143][144] From 2010–2011, 
Atlanta saw a 0.9% contraction in employment and only a 0.4% rise in income. 
Though unemployment had dropped to 7% by late 2014, this was still higher 
than the national unemployment rate of 5.8%[145] Atlanta's housing market 
has also struggled, with home prices falling by 2.1% in January 2012, reaching 
levels not seen since 1996. Compared with a year earlier, the average home 
price in Atlanta fell 17.3% in February 2012, the largest annual drop in 
the history of the index for any city.[146][147] The collapse in home prices 
has led some economists to deem Atlanta the worst housing market in the 
country.[148] Nevertheless, in August 2013, Atlanta appeared on Forbes 
magazine's list of the Best Places for Business and Careers.[149] Atlanta, 
while located in the South, has a culture that is no longer strictly Southern. 
This is due to a large population of migrants from other parts of the U.S., 
in addition to many recent immigrants to the U.S. who have made the metropolitan 
area their home, establishing Atlanta as the cultural and economic hub 
of an increasingly multi-cultural metropolitan area.[150][151] Thus, although 
traditional Southern culture is part of Atlanta's cultural fabric, it is 
mostly the backdrop to one of the nation's most cosmopolitan cities. This 
unique cultural combination reveals itself in the arts district of Midtown, 
the quirky neighborhoods on the city's eastside, and the multi-ethnic enclaves 
found along Buford Highway.[152] Atlanta is one of few United States cities 
with permanent, professional, resident companies in all major performing 
arts disciplines: opera (Atlanta Opera), ballet (Atlanta Ballet), orchestral 
music (Atlanta Symphony Orchestra), and theater (the Alliance Theatre). 
Atlanta also attracts many touring Broadway acts, concerts, shows, and 
exhibitions catering to a variety of interests. Atlanta's performing arts 
district is concentrated in Midtown Atlanta at the Woodruff Arts Center, 
which is home to the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Alliance Theatre. 
The city also frequently hosts touring Broadway acts, especially at The 
Fox Theatre, a historic landmark that is among the highest grossing theatres 
of its size.[153] As a national center for the arts,[154] Atlanta is home 
to significant art museums and institutions. The renowned High Museum of 
Art is arguably the South's leading art museum and among the most-visited 
art museums in the world.[155] The Museum of Design Atlanta (MODA), a design 
museum, is the only such museum in the Southeast.[156] Contemporary art 
museums include the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center and the Museum of Contemporary 
Art of Georgia. Institutions of higher education also contribute to Atlanta's 
art scene, with the Savannah College of Art and Design's Atlanta campus 
providing the city's arts community with a steady stream of curators, and 
Emory University's Michael C. Carlos Museum containing the largest collection 
of ancient art in the Southeast.[157] Atlanta has played a major or contributing 
role in the development of various genres of American music at different 
points in the city's history. Beginning as early as the 1920s, Atlanta 
emerged as a center for country music, which was brought to the city by 
migrants from Appalachia.[158] During the countercultural 1960s, Atlanta 
hosted the Atlanta International Pop Festival, with the 1969 festival taking 
place more than a month before Woodstock and featuring many of the same 
bands. The city was also a center for Southern rock during its 1970s heyday: 
the Allman Brothers Band's hit instrumental "Hot 'Lanta" is an ode to the 
city, while Lynyrd Skynyrd's famous live rendition of "Free Bird" was recorded 
at the Fox Theatre in 1976, with lead singer Ronnie Van Zant directing 
the band to "play it pretty for Atlanta".[159] During the 1980s, Atlanta 
had an active Punk rock scene that was centered on two of the city's music 
venues, 688 Club and the Metroplex, and Atlanta famously played host to 
the Sex Pistols first U.S. show, which was performed at the Great Southeastern 
Music Hall.[160] The 1990s saw the birth of Atlanta hip hop, a subgenre 
that gained relevance following the success of home-grown duo OutKast; 
however, it was not until the 2000s that Atlanta moved "from the margins 
to becoming hip-hop's center of gravity, part of a larger shift in hip-hop 
innovation to the South".[161] Also in the 2000s, Atlanta was recognized 
by the Brooklyn-based Vice magazine for its impressive yet under-appreciated 
Indie rock scene, which revolves around the various live music venues found 
on the city's alternative eastside.[162][163] As of 2010[update], Atlanta 
is the seventh-most visited city in the United States, with over 35 million 
visitors per year.[164] Although the most popular attraction among visitors 
to Atlanta is the Georgia Aquarium,[165] the world's largest indoor aquarium,[166] 
Atlanta's tourism industry is mostly driven by the city's history museums 
and outdoor attractions. Atlanta contains a notable amount of historical 
museums and sites, including the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic 
Site, which includes the preserved childhood home of Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., as well as his final resting place; the Atlanta Cyclorama & 
Civil War Museum, which houses a massive painting and diorama in-the-round, 
with a rotating central audience platform, depicting the Battle of Atlanta 
in the Civil War; the World of Coca-Cola, featuring the history of the 
world-famous soft drink brand and its well-known advertising; the College 
Football Hall of Fame which honors college football and its athletes; the 
National Center for Civil and Human Rights, which explores the Civil Rights 
Movement and its connection to contemporary human rights movements throughout 
the world; the Carter Center and Presidential Library, housing U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter's papers and other material relating to the Carter administration 
and the Carter family's life; and the Margaret Mitchell House and Museum, 
where Mitchell wrote the best-selling novel Gone with the Wind. Atlanta 
also contains various outdoor attractions.[167] The Atlanta Botanical Garden, 
adjacent to Piedmont Park, is home to the 600-foot-long (180 m) Kendeda 
Canopy Walk, a skywalk that allows visitors to tour one of the city's last 
remaining urban forests from 40-foot-high (12 m). The Canopy Walk is considered 
the only canopy-level pathway of its kind in the United States. Zoo Atlanta, 
located in Grant Park, accommodates over 1,300 animals representing more 
than 220 species. Home to the nation's largest collections of gorillas 
and orangutans, the Zoo is also one of only four zoos in the U.S. to house 
giant pandas.[168] Festivals showcasing arts and crafts, film, and music, 
including the Atlanta Dogwood Festival, the Atlanta Film Festival, and 
Music Midtown, respectively, are also popular with tourists.[169] Tourists 
are also drawn to the city's culinary scene, which comprises a mix of urban 
establishments garnering national attention, ethnic restaurants serving 
cuisine from every corner of the world, and traditional eateries specializing 
in Southern dining. Since the turn of the 21st century, Atlanta has emerged 
as a sophisticated restaurant town.[170] Many restaurants opened in the 
city's gentrifying neighborhoods have received praise at the national level, 
including Bocado, Bacchanalia, and Miller Union in West Midtown, Empire 
State South in Midtown, and Two Urban Licks and Rathbun's on the east side.[64][171][172][173] 
In 2011, the New York Times characterized Empire State South and Miller 
Union as reflecting "a new kind of sophisticated Southern sensibility centered 
on the farm but experienced in the city."[174] Visitors seeking to sample 
international Atlanta are directed to Buford Highway, the city's international 
corridor. There, the million-plus immigrants that make Atlanta home have 
established various authentic ethnic restaurants representing virtually 
every nationality on the globe.[175] For traditional Southern fare, one 
of the city's most famous establishments is The Varsity, a long-lived fast 
food chain and the world's largest drive-in restaurant.[176] Mary Mac's 
Tea Room and Paschal's are more formal destinations for Southern food. 
Atlanta is home to professional franchises for three major team sports: 
the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball, the Atlanta Hawks of the National 
Basketball Association, and the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football 
League. The Braves, who moved to Atlanta in 1966, were established as the 
Boston Red Stockings in 1871 and are the oldest continually operating professional 
sports franchise in the United States.[177] The Braves won the World Series 
in 1995, and had an unprecedented run of 14 straight divisional championships 
from 1991 to 2005.[178] The Atlanta Falcons have played in Atlanta since 
their inception in 1966. The Falcons have won the division title five times 
(1980, 1998, 2004, 2010, 2012) and the conference championship once, when 
they finished as the runner-up to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII 
in 1999.[179] The Atlanta Hawks began in 1946 as the Tri-Cities Blackhawks, 
playing in Moline, Illinois. The team moved to Atlanta in 1968, and they 
currently play their games in Philips Arena.[180] The Atlanta Dream is 
the city's Women's National Basketball Association franchise.[181] Atlanta 
has also had its own professional ice hockey and soccer franchises. The 
National Hockey League (NHL) has had two Atlanta franchises: the Atlanta 
Flames began play in 1972 before moving to Calgary in 1980, while the Atlanta 
Thrashers began play in 1999 before moving to Winnipeg in 2011. The Atlanta 
Chiefs was the city's professional soccer team from 1967 to 1972, and the 
team won a national championship in 1968. In 1998 another professional 
soccer team was formed, the Atlanta Silverbacks of the North American Soccer 
League. In April 2014, a Major League Soccer team, Atlanta United FC, was 
formed as an expansion team to begin play in 2017. Atlanta has been the 
host city for various international, professional and collegiate sporting 
events. Most famously, Atlanta hosted the Centennial 1996 Summer Olympics. 
Atlanta has also hosted Super Bowl XXVIII in 1994 and Super Bowl XXXIV 
in 2000. In professional golf, The Tour Championship, the final PGA Tour 
event of the season, is played annually at East Lake Golf Club. In 2001 
and 2011, Atlanta hosted the PGA Championship, one of the four major championships 
in men's professional golf, at the Atlanta Athletic Club. In professional 
ice hockey, the city hosted the 56th NHL All-Star Game in 2008, three years 
before the Thrashers moved. In 2011, Atlanta hosted professional wrestling's 
annual WrestleMania. The city has hosted the NCAA Final Four Men's Basketball 
Championship four times, most recently in 2013. In college football, Atlanta 
hosts the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game, the SEC Championship Game, and the 
Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl.[182] Atlanta's 343 parks, nature preserves, and 
gardens cover 3,622 acres (14.66 km2),[183] which amounts to only 5.6% 
of the city's total acreage, compared to the national average of just over 
10%.[184][185] However, 64% of Atlantans live within a 10-minute walk of 
a park, a percentage equal to the national average.[186] Furthermore, in 
its 2013 ParkScore ranking, the The Trust for Public Land, a national land 
conservation organization, reported that among the park systems of the 
50 most populous U.S. cities, Atlanta's park system received a ranking 
of 31.[187] Piedmont Park, located in Midtown is Atlanta's most iconic 
green space. The park, which has undergone a major renovation and expansion 
in recent years, attracts visitors from across the region and hosts cultural 
events throughout the year. Other notable city parks include Centennial 
Olympic Park, a legacy of the 1996 Summer Olympics that forms the centerpiece 
of the city's tourist district; Woodruff Park, which anchors the campus 
of Georgia State University; Grant Park, home to Zoo Atlanta; and Chastain 
Park, which houses an amphitheater used for live music concerts. The Chattahoochee 
River National Recreation Area, located in the northwestern corner of the 
city, preserves a 48 mi (77 km) stretch of the river for public recreation 
opportunities. The Atlanta Botanical Garden, adjacent to Piedmont Park, 
contains formal gardens, including a Japanese garden and a rose garden, 
woodland areas, and a conservatory that includes indoor exhibits of plants 
from tropical rainforests and deserts. The BeltLine, a former rail corridor 
that forms a 22 mi (35 km) loop around Atlanta's core, will eventually 
be transformed into a series of parks, connected by a multi-use trail, 
increasing Atlanta's park space by 40%.[188] Atlanta offers resources and 
opportunities for amateur and participatory sports and recreation. Jogging 
is a particularly popular local sport. The Peachtree Road Race, the world's 
largest 10 km race, is held annually on Independence Day.[189] The Georgia 
Marathon, which begins and ends at Centennial Olympic Park, routes through 
the city's historic east side neighborhoods.[190] Golf and tennis are also 
popular in Atlanta, and the city contains six public golf courses and 182 
tennis courts. Facilities located along the Chattahoochee River cater to 
watersports enthusiasts, providing the opportunity for kayaking, canoeing, 
fishing, boating, or tubing. The city's only skate park, a 15,000 square 
feet (1,400 m2) facility that offers bowls, curbs, and smooth-rolling concrete 
mounds, is located at Historic Fourth Ward Park.[191] Atlanta is governed 
by a mayor and the Atlanta City Council. The city council consists of 15 
representatives—one from each of the city's 12 districts and three at-large 
positions. The mayor may veto a bill passed by the council, but the council 
can override the veto with a two-thirds majority.[192] The mayor of Atlanta 
is Kasim Reed, a Democrat elected on a nonpartisan ballot whose first term 
in office expired at the end of 2013. Reed was elected to a second term 
on November 5, 2013.[193] Every mayor elected since 1973 has been black.[194] 
In 2001, Shirley Franklin became the first woman to be elected Mayor of 
Atlanta, and the first African-American woman to serve as mayor of a major 
southern city.[195] Atlanta city politics suffered from a notorious reputation 
for corruption during the 1990s administration of Bill Campbell, who was 
convicted by a federal jury in 2006 on three counts of tax evasion in connection 
with gambling income he received while Mayor during trips he took with 
city contractors.[196] As the state capital, Atlanta is the site of most 
of Georgia's state government. The Georgia State Capitol building, located 
downtown, houses the offices of the governor, lieutenant governor and secretary 
of state, as well as the General Assembly. The Governor's Mansion is located 
in a residential section of Buckhead. Atlanta serves as the regional hub 
for many arms of the federal bureaucracy, including the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Atlanta and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[197][198] 
Atlanta also plays an important role in federal judiciary system, containing 
the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and of the 
United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Historically, 
Atlanta has been a stronghold for the Democratic Party. Although municipal 
elections are officially nonpartisan, nearly all of the city's elected 
officials are registered Democrats. The city is split among 14 state house 
districts and four state senate districts, all held by Democrats. At the 
federal level, Atlanta is split between two congressional districts. The 
northern three-fourths of the city is located in the 5th district, represented 
by Democrat John Lewis. The southern fourth is in the 13th district, represented 
by Democrat David Scott. The city is served by the Atlanta Police Department, 
which numbers 2,000[199] officers and oversaw a 40% decrease in the city's 
crime rate between 2001 and 2009. Specifically, homicide decreased by 57%, 
rape by 72%, and violent crime overall by 55%. Crime is down across the 
country, but Atlanta's improvement has occurred at more than twice the 
national rate.[200] Nevertheless, Forbes ranked Atlanta as the sixth most 
dangerous city in the United States in 2012.[201] Due to the more than 
30 colleges and universities located in the city, Atlanta is considered 
a center for higher education.[202] Among the most prominent public universities 
in Atlanta is the Georgia Institute of Technology, a research university 
located in Midtown that has been consistently ranked among the nation's 
top ten public universities for its degree programs in engineering, computing, 
management, the sciences, architecture, and liberal arts. Georgia State 
University, a public research university located in Downtown Atlanta, is 
the largest of the 29 public colleges and universities in the University 
System of Georgia and a major contributor to the revitalization of the 
city's central business district. Atlanta is also home to nationally renowned 
private colleges and universities, most notably Emory University, a leading 
liberal arts and research institution that ranks among the top 20 schools 
in the United States and operates Emory Healthcare, the largest health 
care system in Georgia. [203] Also located in the city is the Atlanta University 
Center, the largest contiguous consortium of historically black colleges, 
comprising Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, 
Morehouse School of Medicine, and Interdenominational Theological Center. 
Atlanta also contains a campus of the Savannah College of Art and Design, 
a private art and design university that has proven to be a major factor 
in the recent growth of Atlanta's visual art community. Atlanta Public 
Schools enrolls 55,000 students in 106 schools, some of which are operated 
as charter schools.[204] The district has been plagued by a widely publicized 
cheating scandal exposed in 2009. Atlanta is also served by many private 
schools, including parochial Roman Catholic schools operated by the Archdiocese 
of Atlanta. The primary network-affiliated television stations in Atlanta 
are WXIA-TV (NBC), WGCL-TV (CBS), WSB-TV (ABC), and WAGA-TV (FOX). The 
Atlanta metropolitan area is served by two public television stations and 
one public radio station. WGTV is the flagship station of the statewide 
Georgia Public Television network and is a PBS member station, while WPBA 
is owned by Atlanta Public Schools. Georgia Public Radio is listener-funded 
and comprises one NPR member station, WABE, a classical music station operated 
by Atlanta Public Schools. Atlanta is served by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 
its only major daily newspaper with wide distribution. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 
is the result of a 1950 merger between The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta 
Constitution, with staff consolidation occurring in 1982 and separate publication 
of the morning Constitution and afternoon Journal ceasing in 2001.[205] 
Alternative weekly newspapers include Creative Loafing, which has a weekly 
print circulation of 80,000. Atlanta magazine is an award-winning, monthly 
general-interest magazine based in and covering Atlanta. Atlanta's transportation 
infrastructure comprises a complex network that includes a heavy rail rapid 
transit system, a light rail streetcar loop, a multi-county bus system, 
Amtrak service via the Crescent, multiple freight train lines, an Interstate 
Highway System, several airports, including the world's busiest, and over 
45 miles (72 kilometres) of bike paths. With a network of freeways that 
radiate out from the city, automobiles are the dominant mode of transportation 
in the region.[206] Three major interstate highways converge in Atlanta: 
I-20 (east-west), I-75 (northwest-southeast), and I-85 (northeast-southwest). 
The latter two combine in the middle of the city to form the Downtown Connector 
(I-75/85), which carries more than 340,000 vehicles per day and is one 
of the most congested segments of interstate highway in the United States.[207] 
Atlanta is mostly encircled by Interstate 285, a beltway locally known 
as "the Perimeter" that has come to mark the boundary between "Inside the 
Perimeter" (ITP), the city and close-in suburbs, and "Outside the Perimeter" 
(OTP), the outer suburbs and exurbs. The heavy reliance on automobiles 
for transportation in Atlanta has resulted in traffic, commute, and air 
pollution rates that rank among the worst in the country.[208][209][210] 
The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) provides public 
transportation in the form of buses and heavy rail. Notwithstanding heavy 
automotive usage in Atlanta, the city's subway system is the eighth busiest 
in the country.[211] MARTA rail lines connect many key destinations, such 
as the airport, Downtown, Midtown, Buckhead, and Perimeter Center. However, 
significant destinations, such as Emory University and Cumberland, remain 
unserved. As a result, a 2012 Brookings Institution study placed Atlanta 
87th of 100 metro areas for transit accessibility.[212] Emory University 
operates its Cliff shuttle buses with 200,000 boardings per month, while 
private minibuses supply Buford Highway. Amtrak, the national rail passenger 
system, provides service to Atlanta via the Crescent train (New York–New Orleans), 
which stops at Peachtree Station.[213] In 2014, the Atlanta Streetcar opened 
to the public. The streetcar's line, which is also known as the Downtown 
Loop, runs 2.7 miles around the downtown tourist areas of Peachtree Center, 
Centennial Olympic Park, the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic 
Site, and Sweet Auburn.[214] The Atlanta Streetcar line is also being expanded 
on in the coming years to include a wider range of Atlanta's neighborhoods 
and important places of interest, with a total of over 50 miles of track 
in the plan.[215] Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the 
world's busiest airport as measured by passenger traffic and aircraft traffic,[216] 
offers air service to over 150 U.S. destinations and more than 80 international 
destinations in 52 countries, with over 2,700 arrivals and departures daily.[217] 
Delta Air Lines maintains its largest hub at the airport.[218] Situated 
10 miles (16 km) south of downtown, the airport covers most of the land 
inside a wedge formed by Interstate 75, Interstate 85, and Interstate 285. 
Cycling is a growing mode of transportation in Atlanta, more than doubling 
since 2009, when it comprised 1.1% of all commutes (up from 0.3% in 2000).[219][220] 
Although Atlanta's lack of bike lanes and hilly topography may deter many 
residents from cycling,[219][221] the city's transportation plan calls 
for the construction of 226 miles (364 kilometres) of bike lanes by 2020, 
with the BeltLine helping to achieve this goal.[222] In 2012, Atlanta's 
first "bike track" was constructed on 10th Street in Midtown. The two lane 
bike track runs from Monroe Drive west to Charles Allen Drive, with connections 
to the Beltline and Piedmont Park.[223] Starting in June 2016, Atlanta 
received a bike sharing program with 100 bikes in Downtown, with 500 more 
being expected by the end of the year.[224] For a sprawling city with the 
nation's ninth-largest metro area, Atlanta is surprisingly lush with trees—magnolias, 
dogwoods, Southern pines, and magnificent oaks. Atlanta has a reputation 
as a "city in a forest" due to an abundance of trees that is rare among 
major cities.[226][227][228][229][230] The city's main street is named 
after a tree, and beyond the Downtown, Midtown, and Buckhead business districts, 
the skyline gives way to a dense canopy of woods that spreads into the 
suburbs. The city is home to the Atlanta Dogwood Festival, an annual arts 
and crafts festival held one weekend during early April, when the native 
dogwoods are in bloom. However, the nickname is also factually accurate, 
as the city's tree coverage percentage is at 36%, the highest out of all 
major American cities, and above the national average of 27%.[231] Atlanta's 
tree coverage does not go unnoticed—it was the main reason cited by National 
Geographic in naming Atlanta a "Place of a Lifetime".[225][232] The city's 
lush tree canopy, which filters out pollutants and cools sidewalks and 
buildings, has increasingly been under assault from man and nature due 
to heavy rains, drought, aged forests, new pests, and urban construction. 
A 2001 study found that Atlanta's heavy tree cover declined from 48% in 
1974 to 38% in 1996.[233] However, the problem is being addressed by community 
organizations and city government: Trees Atlanta, a non-profit organization 
founded in 1985, has planted and distributed over 75,000 shade trees in 
the city,[234] while Atlanta's government has awarded $130,000 in grants 
to neighborhood groups to plant trees.[227] Atlanta has 19 sister cities, 
as designated by Sister Cities International, Inc. (SCI):[235][236] Nation:
