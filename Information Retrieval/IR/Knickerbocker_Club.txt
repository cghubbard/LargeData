The Knickerbocker Club (known informally as The Knick), is a gentlemen's 
club in New York City founded in 1871. The name "Knickerbocker", mainly 
thanks to writer Washington Irving, was a byword for a New York patrician, 
comparable to a "Boston Brahmin."[1][2] The Knick's current clubhouse, 
a neo-Georgian structure at 2 East 62nd Street, was commissioned in 1913 
and completed in 1915.[3] It was designed by William Adams Delano and Chester 
Holmes Aldrich,[4] and has been designated a city landmark.[3] The Knick 
was founded in 1871 by members of the Union Club of the City of New York 
who were concerned that the club's admission standards had fallen.[4] By 
the 1950s, urban social club membership was dwindling, in large part because 
of the movement of wealthy families to the suburbs. In 1959, the Knickerbocker 
Club considered rejoining the Union Club, merging The Knick's 550 members 
with the Union Club's 900 men, but the plan never came to fruition.[4] 
The Knick was the location of a fictional murder in Victoria Thompson's 
2012 whodunit Murder on Fifth Avenue: A Gaslight Mystery (Berkeley 2012, 
ISBN 978-0425247419).[3] The Knick has reciprocal arrangements with clubs 
around the world, such as the Australian Club, Brooks's Club and the Turf 
Club in London, the Jockey-Club de Paris, the Melbourne Club, the Kildare 
Street & University Club, and the Círculo de Armas de Buenos Aires.[citation
