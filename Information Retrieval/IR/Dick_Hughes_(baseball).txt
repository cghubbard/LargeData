Richard Henry Hughes (born February 13, 1938, in Stephens, Arkansas) is 
a retired professional baseball player who played 3 seasons for the St. 
Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). In his rookie year, 1967, 
he led the National League in WHIP (walks+hits per IP), and finished second 
to Tom Seaver in the National League Rookie of the Year voting.[1] Hughes 
played collegiate baseball for the University of Arkansas. Contrary to 
some reports,[which?] it was Nelson Briles, not Hughes, who replaced Bob 
Gibson in the starting rotation for the 1967 St. Louis Cardinals when Gibson 
broke his leg courtesy of a Roberto Clemente line drive. In fact, Hughes 
replaced veteran left-hander Al Jackson in the Cardinals rotation in late 
May, pitching a 2-hit shutout against Atlanta in his first start of the 
season. He went on to win 16 games that year to lead the Redbirds. In spring 
training of 1968, Hughes was warming up in the bullpen when he felt pain 
in his throwing shoulder. Though undiagnosed at the time, the injury was 
later determined to be a torn rotator cuff. At the time, there was no surgery 
to fix such an injury. Despite the injury, Hughes was able to pitch 60 
innings during the 1968 season, but those were the last he would throw
