As Player As Coach William Augustus Hatcher (born October 4, 1960) is a 
former left and center fielder in Major League Baseball player for the 
Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds, Boston 
Red Sox, Philadelphia Phillies and Texas Rangers, and former first base 
coach for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Hatcher is currently the third base 
coach for the Reds. In 1979, Hatcher graduated from Williams High School 
in Williams, Arizona, where he had pitched an 11-inning no-hitter as a 
junior. Hatcher then played for Yavapai Community College in Prescott, 
Arizona, where he was a junior college All-America selection. Hatcher was 
drafted by the Cubs in the sixth round of the January 1981 MLB draft. He 
rose quickly through the Cubs' minor league system, playing exactly one 
season at each minor league level before receiving a late-season call-up 
to the major league club in 1984. He split time between AAA and the Cubs 
during the 1985 season before being traded to the Astros along with Steve 
Engel for Jerry Mumphrey. Hatcher would be the Astros' starting left fielder 
for the next 3½ seasons and is remembered by Astros fans for hitting one 
of the most dramatic post-season home runs ever in the 14th inning of Game 
6 of the Astros' 1986 National League Championship Series vs the New York 
Mets' Jesse Orosco, temporarily saving the Astros from elimination.[2] 
Hatcher had his best statistical season in 1987, when he opened the season 
with a 16-game hitting streak and led the Astros in hitting (.296) and 
had career highs in stolen bases (53, 3rd in the National League), home 
runs (11) and RBI (63). His most dubious achievement came that season as 
well, as he received a 10-game suspension for bat corking.[3] Hatcher later 
explained that he had borrowed the bat from relief pitcher Dave Smith.[4] 
Hatcher broke several of his own, uncorked bats in games leading up to 
the incident, and he continues to maintain his innocence. Near the end 
of the 1989 season, the struggling Astros traded Hatcher to the Pirates 
for Glenn Wilson. He played just 27 games for Pittsburgh before being traded 
to the Reds for Jeff Richardson and Mike Roesler. Hatcher had a memorable 
season in 1990 for the Reds when he stole 30 bases during their closely 
contested 1990 pennant run. On August 21, 1990, he tied the major league 
record against the Cubs with four doubles in one game. He ended up leading 
National League outfielders in fielding percentage (.997) on the season. 
The best hitting performance of Hatcher's career was timely, coming during 
the 1990 World Series against the Oakland Athletics. During the 1990 post-season 
he hit .519 overall (14-for-27), including a World Series record .750 in 
the four-game World Series sweep over the heavily favored A's. This mark 
broke a 62-year-old World Series record that was previously held by Babe 
Ruth (.625 in 1928). Hatcher also set records for most consecutive hits 
in a series (7) and most doubles in a four-game series (4). Despite his 
torrid hitting, Hatcher was not named the Series Most Valuable Player, 
that going to Reds pitcher José Rijo, who had a nearly perfect series of 
his own. Hatcher finished his career with a remarkable .404 postseason 
batting average in 14 games. Hatcher was traded to the Red Sox for Tom 
Bolton in the middle of the 1992 season and, on August 3 of that season 
while with the Red Sox, stole home against the Toronto Blue Jays' Juan 
Guzmán. He was the Red Sox' starter in center field for the 1993 season 
before finishing his career as a reserve for the Phillies and Rangers before 
retiring following the 1995 season. Overall, Hatcher played 12 seasons 
in the Major Leagues. He finished his career with a .264 career batting 
average in 1,233 games. In 2015, Billy Hatcher entered his tenth season 
as a Major League coach with the Reds organization. He works as first-base, 
outfield, and baserunning coach.[5] Prior to joining the Reds, he spent 
ten seasons in the Tampa Bay Rays organization, first as a roving minor-league 
instructor (1996), then as a minor-league coach for 1997 Florida State 
League champion St. Petersburg. Hatcher spent the next eight seasons as 
a member of the Rays' Major League coaching staff (1998–2005) as the first-base 
coach (1998–99, 2003–05), bench coach (2001–02), and third-base coach (2000). 
He holds the distinction of being the only coach to work for the Rays in 
each of the club's first eight years of existence. For the 2016 season, 
he will switch from first base coach to third base coach. Hatcher and his 
wife Karen have a son, Derek, who was Florida's 2004 Class A Player of 
the Year in football at Berkley Prep in Tampa, Florida and then played 
safety for the University of Richmond football team that won the 2008 NCAA 
FCS National Championship. The couple also have a daughter, Chelsea, who 
played soccer at the University of Tennessee from 2008 to 2011.[6] She
