Lynwood Thomas Rowe (January 11, 1910 – January 8, 1961) was an American 
right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball, primarily for the Detroit 
Tigers (1932–42) and Philadelphia Phillies (1943, 1946–49). He was a three-time 
All-Star (1935, 1936 & 1947), and a member of three Tigers' World Series 
teams (1934, 1935 & 1940). Born in Waco, Texas, though brought up in El 
Dorado, Arkansas,[1] the 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m), Rowe was an all-around athlete, 
competing in tennis, golf, and football, as well as baseball. He received 
his nickname, "Schoolboy," while playing on a men's team as a fifteen-year-old 
high school student. In 1932, Rowe played for the Beaumont Exporters in 
the Texas League, leading the league with a 2.34 earned run average and 
winning 19 games. The 1932 Exporters won 100 games and the Texas League 
championship, with Rowe pitching and future Detroit Tigers teammate Hank 
Greenberg leading the team in batting. Greenberg and Rowe were both called 
up to the Tigers in 1933. Rowe joined the Tigers in 1933, and the following 
year won 24 games (a 24–8 record), including an American League record 
sixteen consecutive wins. In the 1934 World Series against the St. Louis 
Cardinals' Gashouse Gang, Rowe was 1–1 in two starts with a 2.95 ERA. In 
Game two, Schoolboy pitched a 12-inning complete game, allowing two earned 
runs, and retiring 22 consecutive batters.[2] In Game 6, Rowe pitched another 
complete game, allowing four runs, but Paul "Daffy" Dean held the Tigers 
to only three.[3] Schoolboy finished fourth in the American League's 1934 
Most Valuable Player voting behind teammates Mickey Cochrane, who won, 
and Charlie Gehringer. Rowe had another strong year in 1935 as the Tigers 
won their second consecutive American League pennant, going 19–13, with 
21 complete games, a league-leading six shutouts, and was selected for 
the American League All-Star team. Rowe went 1–2 in the 1935 World Series, 
despite a 2.51 ERA. He was the losing pitcher in the first game, a 3–0 
Cubs victory, striking out eight batters, pitching a complete game and 
allowing only two earned runs. In Game 3, Rowe got the win, pitching four 
innings in relief. Game 5 was another tough loss, as Schoolboy threw a 
complete game, allowing two earned runs, as the Tigers lost, 3–1. Schoolboy 
had tremendous power and control. In the 1934 and 1935 seasons, he had 
149 strikeouts (third in the AL) and 140 strikeouts (second in the AL), 
respectively. He also led the American League in "Strikeout-to-walk ratio" 
in both 1934 and 1935 and finished in the top four in the league in "Bases 
on balls per 9 innings pitched" seven times, including a career and league 
best 1.31 in 1943. Rowe also contributed to the Tigers' success in 1934 
and 1935 with his hitting. In 1934, he hit for a .303 batting average and 
had eight doubles, two home runs, and 22 RBIs in 109 at bats. In 1935, 
he raised his average to .312 with three home runs and 28 RBIs in 109 at 
bats. In his fifteen seasons in the big leagues, Rowe hit eighteen home 
runs (14th best in major league history for a pitcher) and 153 RBIs. With 
his southern charm and eccentricities, Schoolboy Rowe became a fan favorite 
in Detroit. He was known as a superstitious player who carried amulets, 
talismans, and charms in his pockets, always picked up his glove with his 
left hand and even talked to the ball. Rowe was loved particularly by female 
fans for his good looks and public devotion to his high-school sweetheart, 
Edna Mary Skinner. During a September 13, 1934, nationally broadcast interview 
on the popular Rudy Vallee radio show, Rowe asked his fiancee, "How'm I 
doing, Edna honey?" The line became famous and the incident endeared Schoolboy 
to women across the country, but led to relentless heckling from fans and 
opposing players, who enjoyed taunting him with his own words: "How'm I 
doing, Edna?" During his 16-game win streak in 1934, a reporter asked him 
for his secret, and Schoolboy responded that he would "just eat a lot of 
vittles, climb on that mound, wrap my fingers around the ball and say to 
it, 'Edna, honey, let's go.'" Prior to the 1934 World Series, the Detroit 
News brought Edna to Detroit to write about baseball, Schoolboy, cooking 
or whatever she pleased. Pictures of Edna and Schoolboy or Edna posing 
with Babe Ruth were published in the newspapers, as the nation became caught 
up in the courtship of Schoolboy and Edna. The couple married shortly after 
the 1934 World Series. Actor Nick LaMantia delivers the famous line "How'm 
I doing, Edna?" while playing Schoolboy Rowe in the 2015 feature film "Gore 
Orphanage." [4] Rowe continued his dominant pitching in 1936, with a 19–10 
record for the Tigers. But in 1937 and 1938, Schoolboy's arm was showing 
wear, as he was limited to 31 and 21 innings before being sent down to 
the minor leagues. In 1939, Rowe returned to the Tigers and, in 1940, he 
led the American League with an .842 winning percentage—a record of 16–3. 
His 16 wins, 3.46 ERA, and 138 Adjusted ERA+ (5th in AL) were instrumental 
in leading the Tigers to the 1940 pennant, and he finished No. 7 in that 
year's AL Most Valuable Player voting, though he fared badly in the 1940 
World Series as he lost two games and had an ERA of 17.18. In Game 2, he 
gave up 5 runs in 3-1/3 innings, and was knocked out in the first inning 
of Game 6. Rowe was sold to Brooklyn on April 30, 1942 and was 1–0 for 
the Dodgers. In March 1943, he was sold to the Philadelphia Phillies. Schoolboy 
returned to his old form in 1943, compiling a 14–8 record, a 2.94 ERA, 
and finishing No. 14 in the National League MVP voting. Schoolboy missed 
the 1944 and 1945 seasons to wartime service in the U.S. Navy. He was assigned 
to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station where his former manager, Mickey 
Cochrane, put together an All-Star baseball team that included Schoolboy, 
Bob Feller, Johnny Mize and Billy Herman.[5] The 1944 Great Lakes team 
compiled a 48–2 record, including an 11–1 record against major league teams. 
Schoolboy played as an outfielder as well as a pitcher and led the Great 
Lakes team with a .446 batting average.[6] In one memorable game in August 
1944, Schoolboy hit a double, a triple and a home run for the Navy's Great 
Lakes team, and the local newspaper reported "it was his circuit clout 
which brought deafening roars from the 6,000 park customers. The 'Schoolboy' 
teed off on one of 'Slim' DeLion's slow curves and drove the horsehide 
straight over the center field fence, a tremendous wallop of at least 450 
feet." In September 1944, the Army and Navy staged a military service World 
Series in Hawaii, billed by locals as the "real World Series", because 
so many of the best players in baseball were in the service. Schoolboy 
Rowe pitched for the Navy team that also included Dom DiMaggio and Phil 
Rizzuto.[7] Admiral Nimitz threw out the first pitch, and Rowe's Navy team 
swept the first six games and finally won eight while losing two and tying 
one.[5] After serving two years in World War II, the 36-year-old "Schoolboy" 
returned to the Phillies in top form. In 1946, Rowe was 11–4, led the league 
in winning percentage, and had a career-low earned run average of 2.12. 
Rowe followed with another strong season in 1947, earning a final All-Star 
nod. He was released by the Phillies after the 1949 season and finished 
his pitching career in 1950, with San Diego in the Pacific Coast League. 
Schoolboy had a career 158–101 record, 913 strikeouts, and a 3.87 ERA. 
He spent two seasons (1954-55) as the Tigers' pitching coach and later 
worked as a Tigers scout assigned to cover Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi 
and East Texas. Rowe died of a heart attack at age 50 on January 8, 1961
