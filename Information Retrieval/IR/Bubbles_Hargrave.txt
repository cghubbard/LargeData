Eugene Franklin "Bubbles" Hargrave (July 15, 1892 â€“ February 23, 1969) 
was an American catcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Chicago 
Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, and New York Yankees. He won the National League 
batting title in 1926 while playing for Cincinnati. He was nicknamed "Bubbles" 
because he stuttered when saying "B" sounds.[1] Bubbles' younger brother, 
Pinky Hargrave, was also a major league catcher. Hargrave was born in New 
Haven, Indiana. He started his professional baseball career in 1911 in 
the Central League and made his major league debut in 1913 with the Chicago 
Cubs. He was their backup catcher until 1915. From 1916 to 1920, he played 
mostly in the American Association. In 1920, he had a big season with the 
St. Paul Saints, batting .335 with 22 home runs and finishing second in 
the league batting race. St. Paul won the pennant.[2] Hargrave was then 
acquired by the Cincinnati Reds. He was their starting catcher for most 
of the 1920s and consistently put up good hitting numbers. In 1926, he 
won the National League batting title with a .353 average. The rules at 
the time required batting champions to play in at least 100 games, and 
Hargrave pinch hit several times to get to 105. He was the first catcher 
to lead the NL in batting average.[3] In 1927, he led the league's catchers 
in fielding percentage. Hargrave went back to St. Paul for the 1929 season. 
He managed the club to a second-place finish and also made the league All-Star 
team.[4] He batted .369 in 104 games.[5] The following year, Hargrave served 
as a backup catcher for the New York Yankees. He then went back to the 
minors for a few seasons before retiring in 1934. After his baseball days, 
Hargrave worked for a valve company.[6] He died at age 76 in Cincinnati, 
Ohio. He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1962 and
