As manager As coach David Garcia (born September 15, 1920 in East St. Louis, 
Illinois) is an American retired coach, scout and manager in Major League 
Baseball who spent over 65 years in the game. He served as manager of the 
California Angels (1977–78) and Cleveland Indians (1979–82). Including 
three games as acting manager of the 1975 Indians, during his first coaching 
tenure there, he compiled a career record of 310 wins and 311 defeats (.499).[2] 
Garcia was a minor league infielder for almost 20 seasons — much of that 
time in the farm system of the New York Giants — and never made it to the 
Major Leagues. He began managing at age 27 in 1948 with the Giants' Knoxville 
Smokies farm team of the Class B Tri-State League. He managed in the minor 
leagues and scouted for the club (the San Francisco Giants after 1958) 
through 1968, before joining the San Diego Padres as a minor league manager 
in 1969, their maiden National League season. The following season, in 
his 50th year, Garcia finally reached the Majors as San Diego's third-base 
coach. He coached with the Padres (1970–73), Indians (1975–76; 1979) and 
Angels (1977) and in 1977 he was named manager of the Angels when Norm 
Sherry was fired on July 11. While the Angels continued to stumble in '77, 
the Halos stood at 25–20 when Garcia was released in favor of Jim Fregosi 
on June 1, 1978. Garcia got another chance to manage with the Cleveland 
Indians when Jeff Torborg was fired on July 22, 1979. Cleveland played 
at a 38–28 clip under Garcia for the remainder of the season, and compiled 
a mark of 52–51 during the strike-shortened 1981 campaign, but they never 
finished higher than fifth in the American League East. After a sixth-place 
finish in 1982, Garcia was fired. But he remained in the game into his 
mid 80s, as a coach for the Milwaukee Brewers (1983–84), a special assignment 
scout for the Brewers and Kansas City Royals, and — from 2000–02 — a coach 
with the Colorado Rockies. Garcia was named to Rockies' staff when he was 
79 years of age by then-skipper Buddy Bell.[3] As a minor league manager 
in the Giants, Padres and Angels organizations, Garcia won 890 games and 
lost 785 (.531) and won three championships. Garcia's son David was the 
Yankees first-round pick -- the 11th player taken over all -- in the secondary 
phase of the January 1978 draft. He spent two years in the Yankee systems. 
Garcia also had two grandsons play professional baseball. Drew Garcia was 
a 21st round draft choice of the Chicago White Sox in 2008, and reached 
the Triple-A level. In 2010, the St. Louis Cardinals selected his grandson, 
Greg Garcia in the seventh round of Major League Baseball draft. He made
