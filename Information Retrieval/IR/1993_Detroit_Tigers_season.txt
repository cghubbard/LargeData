The Detroit Tigers' 1993 season was a season in American baseball. It involved 
the Detroit Tigers attempting to win the American League East. The club 
wasn’t expected to do much after a sixth-place finish the previous season. 
The pitching staff was riddled with inconsistencies, but the Tigers were 
in first place as late as June 25, and early in the year, looked like they 
might establish a record for run scoring. At the heart of the team were 
three stars left over from the championship team of 1984: 36-year-old second 
baseman Lou Whitaker, 36-year-old outfielder Kirk Gibson, and 35-year-old 
shortstop Alan Trammell. There was also the All-Star slugger Cecil Fielder 
at first base who, true to form, clubbed 30 home runs and drove in a team-high 
117 RBIs; promising young shortstop Travis Fryman batted an even .300 and 
paced the team with 182 hits; and catcher Chad Kreuter enjoyed the best 
season of his career, setting career-highs in homers (15), average (.286) 
and runs batted in (51). Tony Phillips, a versatile switch hitter, could 
play just about anywhere in the field and even DH, but he mostly ended 
up in the outfield. A patient leadoff man, Phillips set the table for the 
Tigers' offense. He got on base any way he could, with a base hit, drawing 
a walk or getting hit by a pitch more than 300 times; thus, he scored 113 
runs while hitting for a .313 average. Mickey Tettleton was equally flexible. 
He caught, played first, and also saw duty in the outfield and at DH when 
needed. With power from both sides of the plate, Tettleton did serious 
damage, hitting 32 homers, driving in 110 runs, and drawing 109 walks. 
Though the team may often be overlooked in the long, storied history of 
the Tigers' franchise (perhaps due to being in the midst of the team's 
leanest years), they were as powerful a lineup as the Tigers had ever seen, 
and for several weeks they lit up the American League, scoring runs at 
an eye-popping rate. With a lineup built around patience and swing-for-the-fences 
power, the Tigers got off to a remarkable start in tallying runs. In their 
home opener, they pummeled the Oakland Athletics by the score of 20-4. 
In that game Fryman had five RBIs, Tettleton plated four, and Fielder went 
4-for-4 as the Tigers pounded out 18 hits and drew twelve walks. Four days 
later against the Mariners, the Tigers won 20-3, this time behind 20 hits 
and ten more walks. The next day the team outslugged the M's, 8-7. But 
that was just the beginning. When the club went on the road to face the 
Twins for a three-game series in late April, Detroit pounded their way 
to victories by the scores of 12-4, 17-1, and 16-5. In the series, Detroit 
banged out 46 hits and drew 22 walks while clubbing eleven homers and 23 
extra-base hits.[1] On April 23, the Tigers were in first place and they 
would stay there for two months. Over the first six weeks of the season, 
the vaunted Tiger lineup was averaging 8½ runs per game, on pace to score 
more than 1,300 runs. This would have shattered the modern-day record held 
by the 1894 Baltimore Orioles, who scored 1,171 runs.[2] On June 20, the 
Tigers beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7-3, putting them at a 43-25 record, 
two games over second-place Toronto. Even with their success, the pitching 
continued to struggle, as evidenced by numerous high-scoring affairs against 
other top-tier teams such as the Toronto Blue Jays and the New York Yankees. 
In late June, the team went on a ten-game losing skid, during which they 
were outscored 80-31. The Tigers never recovered from the losing streak, 
and finished in a tie for third place in the American League East. They 
did, however, lead the league in runs scored (899), walks (765), on-base 
percentage (.362), and on base-plus slugging (.796). [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
