The current structure of minor league baseball has been in effect since 
the 1990 season when the Class A level was subdivided for a second time 
with the creation of Advanced A. The Rookie level consists of domestic 
and foreign circuits, the latter based in the Dominican Republic and Venezuela.[1] 
League champions listed in Bold. The foundation of the minors' current 
structure was the result of a reorganization initiated by Major League 
Baseball (MLB) before the 1963 season. The reduction from six classes to 
four (AAA, AA, A and Rookie) was a response to the general decline of the 
minors throughout the 1950s and early-1960s when leagues and teams folded 
due to shrinking attendance caused by baseball fans' preference for staying 
at home to watch MLB games on television. The only change made within the 
next 27 years was Class A being subdivided for the first time to form Short 
Season A in 1966.[1] League champions listed in Bold The minors operated 
with six classes (AAA, AA, A, B, C, D) from 1946 to 1962. The Pacific Coast 
League (PCL) was reclassified from AAA to Open in 1952 due to the possibility 
of becoming a third major league. This arrangement ended following the 
1957 season when the relocation of the National League's Dodgers and Giants 
to the West Coast killed any chance of the PCL being promoted. The 1963 
reorganization resulted in the Eastern and South Atlantic Leagues being 
elevated from A to AA, five of seven Class D circuits plus the ones in 
B and C upgraded to A and the Appalachian League reclassified from D to 
Rookie. The Alabamaâ€“Florida League folded following the 1962 campaign.[1]
