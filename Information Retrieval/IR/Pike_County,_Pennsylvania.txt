Pike County is a county located in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. As of 
the 2010 census, the population was 57,369.[1] Its county seat is Milford.[2] 
Pike County is included in the New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan 
Statistical Area. In 2006, Pike County was the fastest-growing county in 
the state of Pennsylvania.[3] Pike County was named for General Zebulon 
Pike. It was organized on March 26, 1814 from part of Wayne County, Pennsylvania. 
Some English settlement in the area had started during the colonial years. 
The longtime original inhabitants were the Lenape Native Americans, known 
by the English colonists as the Delaware Indians because their territory 
was along the Delaware River (as named by the colonists), as well as the 
coastal mid-Atlantic area. In 1694, Governor Benjamin Fletcher of the colony 
of New York sent Captain Arent Schuyler to investigate claims that the 
French were recruiting Indian allies for use against the English. In 1696, 
governor Fletcher authorized purchases of Indian land near the New York 
border by a number of citizens of Ulster County; their descendants became 
the first European settlers of what became Pike County. Nicholas Depui 
was the first to settle in the area, in 1725. Thomas Quick moved to the 
area that would become Milford in 1733. Andrew Dingman settled on the Delaware 
River at the future site of Dingmans Ferry in 1735. The early settlers 
got along well with the Lenape and traded with them. As settlement increased 
and their land practices encroached on Lenape uses, land disputes arose. 
The colonists' infamous Walking Purchase of 1737 swindled the Indians out 
of more than half of present-day Pike County. As they realized what had 
happened, violent conflicts arose between the Lenape and the colonists. 
Early in the nineteenth century, coal was discovered nearby in the area 
that would become Carbondale. This became especially significant as the 
British restricted export of British coal to the United States after the 
War of 1812, creating a fuel shortage in rapidly expanding New York City. 
To get the coal to New York, developers proposed a gravity railroad from 
Carbondale to Honesdale, along with a canal from Honesdale to the Hudson 
River at Kingston. The state of New York approved the canal proposal in 
1823. Work on the 108-mile (174 km) Delaware and Hudson Canal began in 
1825 and was completed in 1828. The canal system which terminated at the 
Hudson River near present-day Kingston, proved profitable. But, the barges 
had to cross the Delaware via a rope ferry across a "slackwater dam," which 
created bottlenecks in the canal traffic and added greatly to the cost 
of transportation. John Roebling proposed continuing the canal over the 
river as part of an aqueduct. Built in 1848, his innovative design required 
only three piers, where five would ordinarily have been required; this 
allowed ice floes and timber rafts to pass under with less damage to the 
bridge. Three other suspension aqueducts were subsequently built for the 
canal. Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct is still standing, possibly the oldest 
suspension bridge in America; it has been named a National Historic Landmark. 
For fifty-one years, coal flowed to New York City via the canal. But the 
development of railroads, which were faster, cheaper, and operated even 
when the canals were frozen, brought the end of the canal era. The New 
York and Erie Railroad supplanted the canal and in 1898 the water route 
was abandoned. From 1904 to 1926, Grey Towers in the borough of Milford, 
Pennsylvania was the site of summer field study sessions for the Master's 
program of the Yale School of Forestry, together with the Forester's Hall, 
a commercial building that was adapted and expanded for this purpose.[4] 
In 1926, the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company built a hydroelectric 
plant on Wallenpaupack creek at the former village of Wilsonville. The 
town was evacuated and now lies under Lake Wallenpaupack, created by a 
dam. A crew of 2,700 men worked for two years to complete the dam for the 
project at a cost of $1,026,000. This required the acquisition of nearly 
a hundred properties, and a number of farms, barns, and homes were razed 
or moved. In addition, 17 miles (27 km) of roads and telephone lines were 
relocated, and a cemetery was moved to make way for the project. The largely 
rural area of the county made it attractive as a country destination. Several 
camps were developed in the area of Milford, Pennsylvania, the county seat. 
It has several hundred late 19th and early 20th-century buildings that 
contribute to a National Historic District listed on the National Register 
of Historic Places. The Yale ran summer field studies for its Master's 
program in forestry there from 1904 to 1926. Since the late 20th century, 
Pike County has been the fastest-growing county in Pennsylvania; between 
1990 and 2000, its population increased by 65.2%, and it grew an additional 
16.9% between 2000 and 2004. The area has relatively low state and county 
taxes, affordable housing, and Interstate 80 and Interstate 84 provide 
rapid commutes to New York City's northern suburbs. According to the U.S. 
Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 567 square miles (1,470 km2), 
of which 545 square miles (1,410 km2) is land and 22 square miles (57 km2) 
(3.9%) is water.[5] The terrain rises rapidly from the river valley in 
the east to the rolling foothills of the Poconos in the west. The highest 
point is one of two unnamed hills in Greene Township that top out at approximately 
2,110 feet (643 m) above sea level.[6] The lowest elevation is approximately 
340 feet (103.6 m), at the confluence of the Bushkill and the Delaware 
rivers. As of the 2010 census, there were 57,369 people residing in the 
county. The county was 88.6% Non-Hispanic White, 6.3% Black or African 
American, 0.5% Native American, 1.2% Asian, and 1.7% were two or more races. 
10.2% of the population were of Hispanic or Latino ancestry [2]. As of 
the census[12] of 2000, there were 46,302 people, 17,433 households, and 
13,022 families residing in the county. The population density was 85 people 
per square mile (33/km²). There were 34,681 housing units at an average 
density of 63 per square mile (24/km²). The racial makeup of the county 
was 93.10% White, 3.27% Black or African American, 0.24% Native American, 
0.62% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 1.30% from other races, and 1.47% 
from two or more races. 5.00% of the population were Hispanic or Latino 
of any race. 18.9% were of German, 18.6% Irish, 18.5% Italian, 6.2% English 
and 5.3% Polish ancestry according to Census 2000. There were 17,433 households 
out of which 34.40% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 
63.50% were married couples living together, 7.60% had a female householder 
with no husband present, and 25.30% were non-families. 20.70% of all households 
were made up of individuals and 8.40% had someone living alone who was 
65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.63 and the average 
family size was 3.06. In the county, the population was spread out with 
26.70% under the age of 18, 5.30% from 18 to 24, 27.70% from 25 to 44, 
25.10% from 45 to 64, and 15.20% who were 65 years of age or older. The 
median age was 40 years. For every 100 females there were 99.30 males. 
For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.30 males. Pike County 
has the largest percentage of same-sex couples in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.[13] 
As of November 2008, there are 45,753 registered voters in Pike County.[14] 
The Republican Party has been historically dominant in county-level politics. 
For statewide and national-level candidates, Pike County has leaned toward 
the Republican Party. In 2000 Republican George W. Bush won 53% to Democrat 
Al Gore's 42%. In 2004 Republican George W. Bush won 58% to Democrat John 
Kerry's 40%. In 2008 Republican John McCain won 51% to Democrat Barack 
Obama's 47%. But, due to population growth, new residents have led an increase 
in Democratic voting. In 2006, Democratic Governor Ed Rendell won Pike 
with 53%. Of the four statewide Democratic candidates in the 2008 election, 
the only one to carry Pike was Jack Wagner. In 2011, Porter Township residents 
successfully petitioned the Pennsylvania Secretary of Education to transfer 
the township from East Stroudsburg Area School District to Wallenpaupack 
Area School District. The appeal by East Stroudsburg Area School District 
was heard by the Commonwealth Court in April 2012. Under Pennsylvania law, 
there are four types of incorporated municipalities: cities, boroughs, 
townships, and, in at most two cases, towns. The following boroughs and 
townships are located in Pike County: The population ranking of the following
