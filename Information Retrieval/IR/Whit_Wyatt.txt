John Whitlow Wyatt (September 27, 1907 – July 16, 1999) was an American 
professional baseball pitcher. He played all or part of sixteen seasons 
in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers (1929–33), Chicago White 
Sox (1933–36), Cleveland Indians (1937), Brooklyn Dodgers (1939–44), and 
Philadelphia Phillies (1945). While injuries sidetracked much of Wyatt's 
early career,[1] he is most famous for his performance in 1941, when his 
team (the Dodgers) won the National League pennant. Wyatt was born in Kensington, 
Georgia, in 1907. As a high school pitching phenom, he once struck out 
23 college hitters in a game.[1] He attended the Georgia Institute of Technology 
in 1927. In 1928, Wyatt joined the Evansville Hubs in the Three-I League. 
After nearly two full seasons with Evansville, including a stretch in 1929 
where he won sixteen straight games,[1] he was acquired by the major league 
Detroit Tigers late in the 1929 season. He made four starts that September 
and October, going 0-1 with a 6.75 ERA. In 1930, Wyatt appeared in 21 games, 
including seven starts, posting a record of 4-5 with a 3.57 ERA. He spent 
most of 1931 in the minor leagues, leading the Texas League with a 1.53 earned 
run average. In 1932, Wyatt managed his first full season, appearing in 
43 games, including 22 starts, with a 9-13 record and a 5.03 ERA. In 1933, 
he was traded in midseason to the White Sox, where he was used mostly in 
relief for the next several seasons. After spending most of 1936 back in 
the minor leagues, he was acquired by the Indians in the Rule 5 draft. 
He pitched in 29 games in 1937, then was back in the minor leagues in 1938. 
In the midst of an MVP season in the American Association,[1] during which 
he won 23 games for the Milwaukee Brewers, he was purchased by the Brooklyn 
Dodgers. After going 8-3 in 16 games in 1939, Wyatt went 15–14 in 1940, 
leading the Dodger staff in innings and strikeouts. His best year was 1941, 
when he was 22–10 with a league-leading 7 shutouts. He was the winning 
pitcher in the only Dodgers victory against the New York Yankees in the 
1941 World Series. He also pitched well in 1942, winning 19 games and leading 
the Dodgers in wins again. During his most productive period, 1940–43, 
Wyatt went 70–36 and led the league in shutouts twice. In addition to being 
one of the best pitchers in the league, he also gained notoriety for head-hunting. 
When a beanball war broke out between frontrunners Brooklyn and St. Louis 
in 1941, Wyatt was at the forefront. Manager Leo Durocher would leave money 
on top of his locker after he hit batters.[2] Joe DiMaggio only faced Wyatt 
in one World Series yet called him "the meanest guy [he] ever saw."[1] 
In a 16-season career, Wyatt posted a 106–95 record with 872 strikeouts 
and a 3.79 ERA in 1761 innings pitched, including 17 shutouts and 97 complete 
games. Later in life, Wyatt spent several years as a pitching coach, notably 
being the first such coach for the Atlanta Braves in 1966. He died in Carrollton,
