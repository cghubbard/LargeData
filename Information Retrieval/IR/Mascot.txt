A mascot is any person, animal, or object thought to bring luck, or anything 
used to represent a group with a common public identity, such as a school, 
professional sports team, society, military unit, or brand name. Mascots 
are also used as fictional, representative spokespeople for consumer products, 
such as the rabbit used in advertising and marketing for the General Mills 
brand of breakfast cereal, Trix. In the world of sports, mascots are also 
used for merchandising. Team mascots are often confused with team nicknames.[1] 
While the two can be interchangeable, they are not always the same. For 
example, the athletic teams of the University of Alabama are nicknamed 
the Crimson Tide, while their mascot is an elephant named Big Al. Team 
mascots may take the form of a logo, person, live animal, inanimate object, 
or a costumed character, and often appear at team matches and other related 
events, sports mascots are often used as marketing tools for their teams 
to children. Since the mid-20th century, costumed characters have provided 
teams with an opportunity to choose a fantasy creature as their mascot, 
as is the case with the Philadelphia Phillies' mascot, the Phillie Phanatic. 
Costumed mascots are commonplace, and are regularly used as goodwill ambassadors 
in the community for their team, company, or organization such as the U.S. 
Forest Service's Smokey Bear. It was originally sporting organisations 
that first thought of using animals as a form of mascot to bring entertainment 
and excitement for their spectators. Before mascots were fictional icons 
or people in suits. Animals were mostly used in order to bring a somewhat 
different feel to the game and to strike fear upon the rivalry teams. As 
the new era was changing and time goes on, the evolution also continued 
to change: from predatory animals, to two-dimensional fantasy mascots, 
to finally what we know today, three-dimensional mascots. The event that 
prompted these changes was the invention of the Muppets in the late 1960s. 
The puppets offered something different to what everyone was used too. 
It allowed to people to not only have visual enjoyment but also allowed 
them to interact physically with the mascots. Marketers quickly released 
the great potential in three-dimensional mascot and took on board the Muppet-like 
idea. This change encouraged other companies to start creating their own 
mascots, resulting in mascots being a necessity amongst not only the sporting 
industry but for other organisations.[2] The word 'mascot' originates from 
the French term 'mascotte' which means lucky charm. This was used to describe 
anything that brought luck to a household. The word was first recorded 
in 1867 and popularised by a French composer Edmond Audran who wrote the 
opera 'La Mascotte', performed in December 1880. [3] But didn't enter into 
the English language until the year after in 1881. However, before this, 
the terms were familiar to the people of France as a slang word used by 
gamblers. The term is a derivative of the word 'masco' meaning sorceress 
or witch. Before the 19th century, the word 'mascot' was associated with 
inanimate objects that would be commonly seen such as a lock of hair or 
a figurehead on a sailing ship. But from then on until the present day, 
the term was then seen to be associated with good luck animals, objects 
etc.[2][3] Often the choice of mascot reflects a desired quality; a common 
example of this is the "fighting spirit," in which a competitive nature 
is personified by warriors or predatory animals. Mascots may also symbolize 
a local or regional trait, such as the Nebraska Cornhuskers' mascot, Herbie 
Husker: a stylized version of a farmer, owing to the agricultural traditions 
of the area in which the university is located. Another example, Pittsburg 
State University uses Gus the Gorilla as its mascot due to "gorilla" being 
an old colloquial term for coal miners in the Southeast Kansas area in 
which the university was established.[4] In the United States, controversy[5] 
surrounds some mascot choices, especially those using human likenesses. 
Mascots based on Native American tribes are particularly contentious, as 
many argue that they constitute offensive exploitations of an oppressed 
culture.[6] However several Indian tribes have actually come out in support 
of keeping the names. For example, the Utah Utes and the Central Michigan 
Chippewas are sanctioned by local tribes. Similarly, the Florida State 
Seminoles are supported by the Seminole Tribe of Florida in their use of 
Osceola and Renegade as symbols. FSU chooses not to refer to them as mascots 
because of the offensive connotation.[7] This has not, however, prevented 
fans from engaging in "Redface"â€“dressing up in stereotypical, Plains Indian 
outfits during games or creating offensive banners saying "Scalp 'em" as 
was seen at the 2014 Rose Bowl.[8] Some sports teams have "unofficial" 
mascots: individual supporters or fans that have become identified with 
the team. The New York Yankees have such an individual in fan Freddy Sez. 
Former Toronto Blue Jays mascot BJ Birdie was a costumed character created 
by a Blue Jays fan, ultimately hired by the team to perform at their home 
games. USC Trojans mascot is Tommy Trojan who rides on his horse (and the 
official mascot of the school) Traveler. Many sports teams in the United 
States (U.S.) have official mascots, sometimes enacted by costumed humans 
or even live animals. One of the earliest was a taxidermy mount for the 
Chicago Cubs, in 1908, and later a live animal used in 1916 by the same 
team. They abandoned the concept shortly thereafter and remained without 
an official "cub" until 2014, when they introduced a version that was a 
person wearing a costume.[9] In the United Kingdom some teams have young 
fans become "mascots". These representatives sometimes have medical issues, 
and the appearance is a wish grant,[10] the winner of a contest,[11] or 
under other circumstances. Unlike the anonymous performers of costumed 
characters, however, their actions can be associated with the club later 
on.[12] Mascots also include older people such as Mr England, who are invited 
by national sports associations to be mascots for the representative teams.[13] 
Mascots or advertising characters are very common in the corporate world. 
Recognizable mascots such as Chester Cheetah, Keebler Elf, Fruit of the 
Loom Guys, Pizza Pizza Guy for Little Caesars, Rocky the Elf, Coca Cola 
Bear, and the NBC Peacock. These characters are typically known without 
even having to refer to the company or brand. This is an example of corporate 
branding, and soft selling a company. Mascots are able to act as brand 
ambassadors where advertising is not allowed. For example, many corporate 
mascots can attend non-profit events, or sports and promote their brand 
while entertaining the crowd. Some mascots are simply cartoons or virtual 
mascots, others are characters in commercials, and others are actually 
created as costumes and will appear in person in front of the public at 
tradeshows or events.[14] Most American schools have a mascot. High schools, 
colleges, and even middle and elementary schools typically have mascots. 
Most of them have their mascot created as a costume, and use this costume 
at sports or social events. Examples of School mascots include University 
of NC Ram, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga's Scrappy the Mocking 
Bird, Temple Owl, Villanova Wildcat, MIT Beaver, Boston University Terrier, 
and St. Joes Hawk. The Mascots that are used for the Summer and Winter 
Olympic games are fictional characters, typically a human figure or an 
animal native to the country to which is holding that year's Olympic Games. 
The mascots are used to entice an audience and bring joy and excitement 
to the Olympics festivities. Sam (Olympic mascot) and Seymore D. Fair from 
1984. Are examples of some of the first mascots used in the Summer Olympic 
Games and the Louisiana World Exposition. Dating back from 1968, the city 
in which holds the Olympic games every two years, has the job at designing 
a mascot that corresponds with the culture of the country and is an icon 
symbol to that of the nations values. Recent Winter/Summer Olympic games 
mascots include Miga, Quatchi, Mukmuk (Vancouver, 2010), Wenlock and Mandeville 
(London, 2012), Bely Mishka, Snow Leopard, Zaika (Sochi, 2014) and Vinicius 
and Tom (Rio, 2016) have all gone on to become iconic symbols in their 
respective countries.[15] Camilla Corona SDO is the mission mascot for 
NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and assists the mission with Education 
and Public Outreach (EPO).[16] Mascots are also popular in military units. 
For example, the United States Marine Corps uses the English Bulldog as 
its mascot, while the United States Army uses the mule, the United States 
Navy uses the goat, and the United States Air Force uses the Gyrfalcon. 
The goat in the Royal Welsh is officially not a mascot but a ranking soldier. 
Lance Corporal William Windsor retired on 20 May 2009, and a replacement 
is expected in June.[17] Several regiments of the British Army have a live 
animal mascot which appear on parades. The Parachute Regiment and the Argyll 
and Sutherland Highlanders have a Shetland pony as their mascot, a ram 
for The Mercian Regiment; an Irish Wolfhound for the Irish Guards and the 
Royal Irish Regiment; a drum horse for the Queen's Royal Hussars and the 
Royal Scots Dragoon Guards; an antelope for the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers; 
and a goat for the Royal Welsh. Other British military mascots include 
a Staffordshire Bull Terrier and a pair of ferrets. The Norwegian Royal 
Guard adopted a king penguin named Nils Olav as its mascot on the occasion 
of a visit to Edinburgh by its regimental band. The (very large) penguin 
remains resident at Edinburgh Zoo and has been formally promoted by one 
rank on the occasion of each subsequent visit to Britain by the band or 
other detachments of the Guard. Regimental Sergeant Major Olav was awarded 
the Norwegian Army's Long Service and Good Conduct medal at a ceremony 
in 2005. Some bands, particularly in the heavy metal genre use band mascots 
to promote their music. The mascots are usually found on album covers or 
merchandise such as band T-shirts, but can also make appearances in live 
shows or music videos. A famous example of a band mascot is Eddie the Head 
of the English heavy metal band Iron Maiden. Eddie is a zombie-like creature 
which is personified in different forms on all of the band's albums, most 
of its singles and some of its promotional merchandise. Eddie is also known 
to make live appearances, especially during the song "Iron Maiden". Another 
notable example of a mascot in music is Skeleton Sam of The Grateful Dead. 
South Korean hip hop band B.A.P uses rabbits named Matoki as their mascot, 
each bunny a different color representing each member, Yongguk, Himchan, 
Daehyun, Youngjae, Jongup, and Zelo. Although rabbits have an innocent 
image, BAP gives off a tough image. Hip hop artist Kanye West used to use 
a teddy bear named Dropout Bear as his mascot; Dropout Bear has appeared 
on the cover of West's first three studio albums, and served as the main
