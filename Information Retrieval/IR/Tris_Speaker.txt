As player As manager MLB Records Tristram Edgar Speaker (April 4, 1888 
– December 8, 1958), nicknamed "The Grey Eagle", was an American baseball 
player. Considered one of the best offensive and defensive center fielders 
in the history of Major League Baseball (MLB), he compiled a career batting 
average of .345 (sixth all-time[1]). His 792 career doubles represent an 
MLB career record. His 3,514 hits are fifth in the all-time hits list. 
Defensively, Speaker holds career records for assists, double plays, and 
unassisted double plays by an outfielder. His fielding glove was known 
as the place "where triples go to die."[2] After playing in the minor leagues 
in Texas and Arkansas, Speaker debuted with the Boston Red Sox in 1907. 
He became the regular center fielder by 1909 and led the Red Sox to World 
Series championships in 1912 and 1915. In 1915, Speaker's batting average 
dropped to .322 from .338 the previous season; he was traded to the Cleveland 
Indians when he refused to take a pay cut. As player-manager for Cleveland, 
he led the team to its first World Series title. In ten of his eleven seasons 
with Cleveland, he finished with a batting average greater than .350. Speaker 
resigned as Cleveland's manager in 1926 after he and Ty Cobb faced game 
fixing allegations; both men were later cleared. During his managerial 
stint in Cleveland, Speaker introduced the platoon system in the major 
leagues. Speaker played with the Washington Senators in 1927 and the Philadelphia 
Athletics in 1928, then became a minor league manager and part owner. He 
later held several roles for the Cleveland Indians. Late in life, Speaker 
led a short-lived indoor baseball league, ran a wholesale liquor business, 
worked in sales and chaired Cleveland's boxing commission. He was inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937. He was named 27th [3] in the Sporting 
News 100 Greatest Baseball Players (1999) and was also included in the 
Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Speaker was born on April 4, 1888, 
in Hubbard, Texas, to Archie and Nancy Poer Speaker.[4] As a youth, Speaker 
broke his arm after he fell from a horse; the injury forced him to become 
left-handed.[5] In 1905, Speaker played a year of college baseball for 
Fort Worth Polytechnic Institute. Newspaper reports have held that Speaker 
suffered a football injury and nearly had his arm amputated around this 
time;[6] biographer Timothy Gay characterizes this as "a story that the 
macho Speaker never disspelled [sic]."[7] He worked on a ranch before beginning 
his professional baseball career.[8] Speaker's abilities drew the interest 
of Doak Roberts, owner of the Cleburne Railroaders of the Texas League, 
in 1906. After losing several games as a pitcher, Speaker converted to 
outfielder to replace a Cleburne player who had been struck in the head 
with a pitch.[5] He batted .318 for the Railroaders. Speaker's mother opposed 
his participation in the major leagues, saying that they reminded her of 
slavery.[9] Though she relented, for several years Mrs. Speaker questioned 
why her son had not stayed home and entered the cattle or oil businesses.[10] 
He performed well for the Texas League's Houston Buffaloes in 1907, but 
his mother stated that she would never allow him to go to the Boston Americans. 
Roberts sold the youngster to the Americans for $750 or $800 (equal to 
$19,079 or $20,351 today).[11] Speaker played in seven games for the Americans 
in 1907, with three hits in 19 at bats for a .158 average. In 1908, Boston 
Americans owner John I. Taylor changed the team's name to the Boston Red 
Sox after the bright socks in the team's uniform.[12] That year, the club 
traded Speaker to the Little Rock Travelers of the Southern League in exchange 
for use of their facilities for spring training.[13] Speaker batted .350 
for the Travelers and his contract was repurchased by the Red Sox. He logged 
a .224 batting average in 116 at bats.[14] Speaker became the regular starting 
center fielder for Boston in 1909 and light-hitting Denny Sullivan was 
sold to the Cleveland Naps. Speaker hit .309 in 143 games as the team finished 
third in the pennant race.[15] Defensively, Speaker was involved in 12 
double plays, leading the league's outfielders, and had a .973 fielding 
percentage, third among outfielders.[16] In 1910 the Red Sox signed left 
fielder Duffy Lewis. Speaker, Lewis and Harry Hooper formed Boston's "Million-Dollar 
Outfield", one of the finest outfield trios in baseball history. Speaker 
was the star of the Million-Dollar Outfield. He ran fast enough that he 
could stand very close to second base, effectively giving the team a fifth 
infielder, but he still caught the balls hit to center field.[17] In 1910 
and 1911, Boston finished fourth in the American League standings.[18][19] 
Speaker's best season came in 1912. He played every game and led the American 
League (AL) in doubles (53) and home runs (10). He set career highs with 
222 hits, 136 runs, 580 at-bats, and 52 stolen bases.[14] Speaker's stolen 
base tally was a team record until Tommy Harper stole 54 bases in 1973.[20] 
He batted .383 and his .567 slugging percentage was the highest of his 
dead-ball days. Speaker set a major league single-season record with three 
hitting streaks of twenty or more games (30, 23, and 22). He also became 
the first major leaguer to hit 50 doubles and steal 50 bases in the same 
season. In August, Speaker's mother unsuccessfully attempted to convince 
him to quit baseball and come home.[21] In Fenway Park's first game, Speaker 
drove in the winning run in the 11th inning, giving Boston the 7–6 win. 
The 1912 Red Sox won the AL pennant, finishing 14 games ahead of the Washington 
Senators and 15 games ahead of the Philadelphia Athletics. In the 1912 
World Series, Speaker led the Red Sox to their second World Series title 
by defeating John McGraw's New York Giants. After the second game was called 
on account of darkness and ended in a tie, the series went to eight games. 
The Red Sox won the final game after Fred Snodgrass dropped an easy fly 
ball and later failed to go after a Speaker pop foul. After the pop foul, 
Speaker tied the game with a single. The Red Sox won the game in the bottom 
of the tenth inning. He finished the series with a .300 batting average, 
nine hits and four runs scored. Speaker was named the AL Most Valuable 
Player (MVP) for 1912.[22] Though he did not lead the league in any offensive 
categories in 1913, Speaker finished fourth in AL MVP voting.[14] Speaker 
batted .338 and tied his career high of 12 double plays as an outfielder 
in 1914.[14][16] He hit .322 in 1915.[14] The Red Sox beat the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the 1915 World Series. The Red Sox were led by pitcher Babe 
Ruth, who was playing in his first full season. Ruth won 18 games and hit 
a team-high four home runs. Speaker got five hits, including a triple, 
in 17 at-bats during the series. He scored twice but did not drive in any 
runs.[23] After 1915, Red Sox president Joseph Lannin wanted Speaker to 
take a pay cut from about $15,000 (equal to $351,464 today) to about $9,000 
(equal to $210,878 today) because of the drop in his batting average; Speaker 
refused and offered $12,000 ($281,171 today). On April 8, 1916, Lannin 
traded Speaker to the Cleveland Indians.[24] In exchange, Boston received 
Sad Sam Jones, Fred Thomas and $50,000 ($1,089,144 today). The angry Speaker 
held out until he received $10,000 (equal to $217,829 today) of the cash 
that Boston collected.[25] With an annual salary of $40,000 (equal to $871,315 
today), Speaker was the highest paid player in baseball.[26] Speaker hit 
over .350 in nine of his eleven years with Cleveland. In 1916, he led the 
league in hits, doubles, batting average, slugging percentage and on-base 
percentage.[14] Cobb had won the previous nine consecutive AL batting titles; 
Speaker outhit him with a .386 batting average compared to Cobb's .371.[27] 
The center field fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 feet from home 
plate until it was shortened to 420 feet in 1920.[28] Even so, Speaker 
played so shallow in the outfield that he was able to execute six career 
unassisted double plays at second base, catching low line drives on the 
run and then beating baserunners to the bag. At least once he was credited 
as the pivot man in a routine double play. He was often shallow enough 
to catch pickoff throws at second base.[29] At one point, Speaker's signature 
move was to come in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag play on 
a baserunner who had passed the bag.[30] While in Cleveland, Speaker participated 
in diverse activities off the baseball field. Speaker enrolled in an aviator 
training program in 1918.[31] Though World War I ended less than two months 
after he enrolled, Speaker completed his training and served in the naval 
reserves for several years.[32] He also owned a ranch in Texas and competed 
in roping events during the baseball offseason.[33] From the day that Speaker 
arrived in Cleveland, manager Lee Fohl rarely made an important move without 
consulting him. George Uhle recalled an incident from 1919 during his rookie 
year with the Indians. Speaker often signaled to Fohl when he thought that 
a pitcher should be brought in from the bullpen. One day, Fohl misread 
Speaker's signal and brought in a different pitcher than Speaker had intended. 
To avoid the appearance of overruling his manager, Speaker let the change 
stand. Pitcher Fritz Coumbe lost the game, Fohl resigned that night and 
Speaker became manager. Uhle said that Speaker felt bad for contributing 
to Fohl's departure.[34] Speaker guided the 1920 Indians to their first 
World Series win. In a crucial late season game against the second-place 
White Sox, Speaker caught a hard line drive hit to deep right-center field 
by Shoeless Joe Jackson, ending the game. On a dead run, Speaker leaped 
with both feet off the ground, snaring the ball before crashing into a 
concrete wall. As he lay unconscious from the impact, Speaker still held 
the baseball.[35] In the 1920 World Series against Brooklyn, Speaker hit 
an RBI triple in the deciding game, which the Indians won 3–0.[36] Cleveland's 
1920 season was also significant due to the death of Ray Chapman on August 
17. Chapman died after being hit in the head by a pitch from Carl Mays. 
Chapman had been asked about retirement before the season, and he said 
that he wanted to help Speaker earn Cleveland's first World Series victory 
before thinking of retirement.[37] During that championship season, Speaker 
is credited with introducing the platoon system, which attempted to match 
right-handed batters against left-handed pitchers and vice versa. Sportswriter 
John B. Sheridan was among the critics of the system, saying, "The specialist 
in baseball is no good and won't go very far... The whole effect of the 
system will be to make the players affected half men... It is farewell, 
a long farewell to all that player's chance of greatness... It destroys 
young ball players by destroying their most precious quality – confidence 
in their ability to hit any pitcher, left or right, alive, dead, or waiting 
to be born."[38] Baseball Magazine was supportive, pointing out that Speaker 
had results that backed up his system.[38] The 1921 Indians remained in 
a tight pennant race all year, finishing 4 1⁄2 games behind the Yankees. 
The Indians did not seriously contend for the pennant from 1922 through 
1925.[38] Speaker led the league in doubles eight times, including every 
year between 1920 and 1923.[14] He led the league's outfielders in fielding 
percentage in 1921 and 1922.[16] On May 17, 1925, Speaker became the fifth 
member of the 3,000 hit club when he hit a single off pitcher Tom Zachary 
of the Washington Senators. Only Napoleon Lajoie had previously accomplished 
the feat as a member of the Indians.[39] AL President Ban Johnson asked 
Speaker and Detroit manager Cobb to resign their posts after a scandal 
broke in 1926. Pitcher Dutch Leonard claimed that Speaker and Cobb fixed 
at least one game between Cleveland and Detroit. In a newspaper column 
published shortly before the hearings were to begin, Billy Evans characterized 
the accusations as "purely a matter of personal revenge" for Leonard. The 
pitcher was said to be upset with Cobb and Speaker after a trade ended 
with Leonard in the minor leagues.[40] When Leonard refused to appear at 
the January 5, 1927 hearings to discuss his accusations, Commissioner Landis 
cleared both Speaker and Cobb of any wrongdoing. Both were reinstated to 
their original teams, but each team declared its manager free to sign elsewhere. 
Speaker did not return to big league managing and he finished his MLB managerial 
career with a 617–520 record.[41] At the time of his 1926 resignation, 
news reports described Speaker as permanently retiring from baseball to 
pursue business ventures.[42] However, Speaker signed to play with the 
Washington Senators for 1927.[43] Cobb joined the Philadelphia Athletics. 
Speaker joined Cobb in Philadelphia for the 1928 season; he played part-time 
and finished with a .267 average.[44] Prior to that season, Speaker had 
not hit for a batting average below .300 since 1908.[14] Speaker's major 
league playing career ended after 1928. He retired with 792 doubles, an 
all-time career record as of 2014.[14] Defensively, Speaker holds the all-time 
career records (as of 2013) for assists as an outfielder and double plays 
as an outfielder.[16] He remains the last batter to hit 200 triples in 
a career. In 1929 Speaker replaced Walter Johnson as the manager of the 
Newark Bears of the International League.[45] In two seasons with Newark, 
he also appeared as a player in 59 games.[46] When Speaker resigned during 
his second season, the Bears were in seventh place after a sixth-place 
finish in 1929.[47] In January 1933 he became a part owner and manager 
of the Kansas City Blues.[48] By May, Speaker had been replaced as manager 
but remained secretary of the club.[49] By 1936, he had sold his share 
of the team.[50] In 1937, Speaker was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame 
during its second year of balloting. He was honored at the hall's first 
induction ceremony in 1939.[51] After his playing and managing days, Speaker 
was an entrepreneur and salesman. By 1937, Speaker had opened a wholesale 
liquor business and worked as a state sales representative for a steel 
company.[52] He chaired Cleveland's boxing commission between 1936 and 
1943. Newspaper coverage credited Speaker with several key reforms to boxing 
in Cleveland, including the recruitment of new officials and protections 
against fight fixing. Under Speaker, fight payouts went directly to boxers 
rather than managers.[53] Speaker sorted out a scheduling conflict for 
a 1940 boxing match in Cleveland involving former middleweight champion 
Teddy Yarosz.[54] Yarosz defeated Jimmy Reeves in ten rounds and the fight 
attracted over 8,300 spectators.[55] In 1937, Speaker sustained a 16-foot 
fall while working on a flower box near a second-story window at his home. 
Upon admission to the hospital, he underwent facial surgery. He was described 
as having "better than an even chance to live" and was suffering from a 
skull fracture, a broken arm and possible internal injuries.[56] He ultimately 
recovered.[57] In 1939, Speaker was president of the National Professional 
Indoor Baseball League. The league had teams in New York, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, 
Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Cincinnati and St. Louis.[58] The league shut 
down operations due to poor attendance only two months after its formation.[59] 
Speaker was one of the founders of Cleveland's Society for Crippled Children 
and he helped to promote the society's rehabilitation center, Camp Cheerful.[60] 
Speaker served as vice president of the society, ran fundraising campaigns 
and received a distinguished service award from the organization.[61] He 
became seriously ill with pneumonia in 1942.[62] Speaker ultimately recovered, 
but Gay characterized Speaker's condition as "touch-and-go for several 
days".[63] In 1947, Speaker returned to baseball as "ambassador of good 
will" for Bill Veeck and the Cleveland Indians.[64] He remained in advisory, 
coaching or scouting roles for the Indians until his death in 1958. In 
an article in the July 1952 issue of SPORT, Speaker recounted how Veeck 
hired him in 1947 to be a coaching consultant to Larry Doby, the first 
black player in the AL and the second in the major leagues. Before the 
Indians had signed Doby, he was the star second baseman of the Newark Eagles 
of the Negro Leagues. A SPORT photograph that accompanied the article shows 
Speaker mentoring five members of the Indians: Luke Easter, Jim Hegan, 
Ray Boone, Al Rosen and Doby. Speaker was inducted into the Texas Sports 
Hall of Fame in 1951. Texas was the first state to establish a state sports 
hall of fame and Speaker was in its inaugural induction class.[65] Speaker 
died of a heart attack on December 8, 1958, at the age of 70, at Lake Whitney, 
Texas. He collapsed as he and a friend were pulling their boat into the 
dock after a fishing trip. It was his second heart attack in four years.[66] 
Speaker was buried at Fairview Cemetery in Hubbard, Texas.[67] After Speaker's 
death, Cobb said, "Terribly depressed. I never let him know how much I 
admired him when we were playing against each other... It was only after 
we finally became teammates and then retired that I could tell Tris Speaker 
of the underlying respect I had for him." Lajoie said, "He was one of the 
greatest fellows I ever knew, both as a baseball player and as a gentleman."[68] 
Former Boston teammate Duffy Lewis said, "He was a team player. As great 
a hitter as he was, he wasn't looking out for his own average ... Speaker 
was the bell cow of our outfield. Harry Hooper and I would watch him and 
know how to play the hitters."[69] S is for Speaker, Swift center-field 
tender, When the ball saw him coming, It yelled, "I surrender." Immediately 
after Speaker's death, the baseball field at the city park in Cleburne, 
Texas was renamed in honor of Speaker.[67] In 1961, the Tris Speaker Memorial 
Award was created by the Baseball Writers' Association of America to honor 
players or officials who make outstanding contributions to baseball.[71] 
In 1999, he ranked number 27 on the Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest 
Baseball Players. He was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century 
Team.[72][73] Speaker is mentioned in the poem "Line-Up for Yesterday" 
by Ogden Nash.[74] In 2008, former baseball players' union chief Marvin 
Miller, trying to defend the recently retired catcher Mike Piazza against 
claims that he should not be elected to the Hall of Fame because of association 
with the use of steroids, on the basis that the Hall of Fame has various 
unsavory people in it, opined that Speaker should be removed from the Hall 
of Fame because of alleged membership in the Ku Klux Klan. Miller said, 
"Some of the early people inducted in the Hall were members of the Ku Klux 
Klan: Tris Speaker, Cap Anson, and some people suspect Ty Cobb as well. 
I think that by and large, the players, and certainly the ones I knew, 
are good people. But the Hall is full of villains."[75] Miller's comment 
about Anson has no basis, other than speculating that he could have been 
a Klansman since he was a racist during his playing career, which ended 
in 1897, although he was umpiring games with black players by 1901, including 
featuring the all-black Columbia Giants. Miller, age 91 at the time the 
2008 article appeared, is the earliest source for declaring that it is 
factual that Anson was a member of the Klan, based purely on an Internet 
search of sources that try to link Anson to the Klan. By contrast, Speaker-Cobb-Rogers 
Hornsby biographer Charles C. Alexander, a Klan expert in his general history 
writings, told fellow baseball author Marty Appel, apparently referring 
to the 1920s (Anson died in 1922), “As I’ve suggested in the biographies, 
it’s possible that they [Speaker, Cobb and Hornsby] were briefly in the 
Klan, which was very strong in Texas and especially in Fort Worth and Dallas. 
The Klan went all out to recruit prominent people in all fields, provided 
they were native born, Protestant and white.”[76] Baseball historian Bill 
James does not dispute this claim in apparently referring to Speaker and 
possibly Cobb, but says that the Klan had toned down its racist overtures 
during the 1920s and pulled in hundreds of thousands of non-racist men, 
including Hugo Black.[77] James adds that Speaker was a staunch supporter 
of Doby when he broke the American League color barrier, working long hours 
with the former second baseman on how to play the outfield.[78] Gay, Timothy
