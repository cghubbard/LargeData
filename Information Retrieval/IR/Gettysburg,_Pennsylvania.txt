Gettysburg is a borough and the county seat of Adams County in the U.S. 
state of Pennsylvania.[5] The Battle of Gettysburg (1863) and President 
Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address are named for this town. The town 
hosts visitors to the Gettysburg National Battlefield in the Gettysburg 
National Military Park. As of the 2010 census, the borough had a population 
of 7,620 people.[6] Samuel (also reported as James) Gettys settled at the 
Shippensburg–Baltimore and Philadelphia–Pittsburgh crossroads with a 1761 
tavern where soldiers and traders came to rest. To the southwest is the 
1776 Dobbin House Tavern within the subsequent 1786 border established 
for the borough. After a "Strabane" township location between "Hunter's 
and Getty's towns" was planned as the county seat in 1790, in 1791 "Revd. 
Alexander Dobbin and David Moore Sr. were appointed trustees for the county 
of Adams to erect public buildings in…Gettysburg."[7] The founder of the 
Studebaker Corporation was born in 1833 in Gettysburg. In 1858 the Gettysburg 
Railroad completed construction of a railroad line from Gettysburg to Hanover. 
The Gettysburg Railroad Station opened in 1859. Passenger train service 
to the town ended in 1942. The station was restored in 2006. In 2011, Senator 
Robert Casey introduced S. 1897, which would include the railroad station 
within the boundary of Gettysburg National Military Park.[8] By 1860, the 
borough "had around 450 buildings [which] housed carriage manufacturing, 
shoemakers, and tanneries".[9] The Battle of Gettysburg, one of the largest 
battles during the American Civil War, was fought between July 1-3 1863 
across the fields and heights south of the town. In the end, Confederate 
General Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia retreated back 
into Virginia, while George G. Meade and the Army of the Potomac tried 
but failed to pursue Lee and his men. Casualties were high; there were 
over 27,000 Confederate and 23,000 Union losses. The residents of Gettysburg 
were left to care for the wounded and bury the dead following the Confederate 
retreat. Approximately 8,000 men and 3,000 horses lay under the summer 
sun. The soldiers' bodies were gradually reinterred in what is today known 
as Gettysburg National Cemetery, where, on November 19, 1863, Abraham Lincoln 
attended a ceremony to officially consecrate the grounds and delivered 
his famous Gettysburg Address. A 20-year-old woman, Jennie Wade, was the 
only civilian killed during the battle. She was hit by a stray bullet that 
passed through her kitchen door while she was making bread on July 3. Physical 
damage can still be seen in some of the houses throughout the town, notably 
the Schmucker House located on Seminary Ridge. The furniture manufacturing 
grew in Gettysburg in the early 1900s. The Gettysburg Manufacturing Company 
was formed in 1902 to manufacture a variety of residential furniture. It 
had become the Gettysburg Furniture Company by 1912.[10] Another local 
furniture company was the Warner Furniture company[11] and its successor, 
the Engle Furniture Company, which commenced making residential furniture 
in 1905. Engle became the Reaser Furniture Company in 1907,[11] and continued 
to produce dozens of styles. In 1917 the joint venture Stouck-Reaser Company[12] 
formed to buy, sell and deal in wholesale lumber products.[13] The company 
continued to appear in local newspapers through the 1920s. Furniture production 
remained an important industry in the area through the 1920s. In 1920 the 
Gettysburg Panel Company formed to manufacture veneer panels for the other 
firms. In 1923, the Gettysburg Chair Company was chartered to supply chairs 
that the local factories needed to complete their bedroom and dining room 
suites.[14] In 1923, the borough's production of furniture totaled almost 
71,000 pieces. In 1927 there were 522 employees in the three plants: 261 
in Gettysburg, 153 in Reaser, and 108 in Panel. The industry declined in 
the mid-1900s, however. In 1951, the Stouck-Reaser company obtained a permit 
for a new office building,[15] and the other companies were sold. The Gettysburg 
Furniture Company factory closed in 1960, becoming a warehouse and distribution 
point for other furniture factories outside Pennsylvania.[16][17][verification

was located in Gettysburg in 1966.[18] Gettysburg manufacturing associated 
with tourism included a late 19th-century foundry that created gun carriages 
and bridgeworks for the Gettysburg Battlefield, as well as a construction 
industry for hotels, stables, and other buildings for tourist services. 
Early tourist buildings in the borough included museums (like the 1881 
Danner Museum[19]), souvenir shops, buildings of the electric trolley (preceded 
by a horse trolley from the Gettysburg Railroad Station to the Springs 
Hotel), and stands for hackmen who drove visitors in jitneys (horse-drawn 
group taxis) on tours. Modern tourist services in the borough include ghost 
tours, bed and breakfast lodging, and historical interpretation (reenactors, 
etc.). Gettysburg is located on U.S. Route 30 about 25 miles (40 km) west 
of York, Pennsylvania. Rock Creek, a tributary of the Monocacy River and 
part of the Potomac River watershed, flows along its eastern edge. According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 1.7 
square miles (4.3 km2), all land.[6] Gettysburg lies in the transition 
zone between the humid continental climate of northern and central Pennsylvania 
to the north and the humid subtropical climate of central Maryland to the

with such historic sites as Gettysburg National Military Park (including 
the Gettysburg National Cemetery) and Eisenhower National Historic Site. 
Gettysburg has many activities and tours to offer to vacationers and tourists 
who are interested in the Gettysburg area and the history of the community 
and the battle. Tourists for the annual reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg 
use borough facilities, which include the Dobbin House Tavern and Hotel 
Gettysburg. Every year from July 1-3 volunteers reenact the Battle of Gettysburg. 
Each day re-enactors display a different part of the battle as well as 
commentary regarding the hardships of the battles. The battles are narrated 
by the battlefield guides of the Gettysburg National Military Park.[30]
