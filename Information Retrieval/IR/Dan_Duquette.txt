Dan Duquette (born May 26, 1958) is the current General Manager of the 
Baltimore Orioles.[1] He was previously the General Manager for the Montreal 
Expos (1991–1994) and the Boston Red Sox (1994–2002).[2] He is also the 
founder of the Dan Duquette Sports Academy.[3] He has twice been named 
the Major League Baseball Executive of the Year by Sporting News (1992 
with the Expos and 2014 with the Orioles).[4] Duquette is a native of Dalton, 
Massachusetts. He attended a Catholic grammar school in Dalton during which 
time he was a batboy for the Wahconah Regional High School baseball team. 
In high school, he was the captain of both the baseball and football teams. 
After high school, he attended Amherst College where he was a catcher on 
the varsity baseball team and a linebacker on the football team. In the 
summer of 1977 at the age of 19, Duquette helped organize the Dalton Collegians, 
a semi-pro baseball team that operated out of his hometown. In college, 
Duquette was chosen to the 1979 Boston Herald American All New England 
College Division All Star team. Duquette was also known to talk to professional 
scouts who attended Amherst baseball games.[5] He graduated from college 
in 1980.[6] After college, Duquette's baseball coach, Bill Thurston, recommended 
him to Harry Dalton, a fellow Amherst alumnus and General Manager of the 
Milwaukee Brewers. Duquette became a scouting assistant for the Brewers 
and worked in the scouting department for 7 years.[6][7] In 1987, he was 
hired by the Montreal Expos as the Director of Player Development. He spent 
a few years in that position before being promoted to Vice President and 
General Manager in 1991 (taking over for the departing Dave Dombrowski). 
Over the course of his six years with the Expos, Duquette had a hand in 
drafting players like Rondell White, Marquis Grissom, Cliff Floyd, Jose 
Vidro, Kirk Reuter, Javier Vasquez, and many more Major League players. 
He also signed players like Vladimir Guerrero, John Wetteland, and Larry 
Walker.[7][8] In November 1993, Duquette traded second baseman Delino DeShields 
for Pedro Martinez of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Expos were competitive 
from 1992 to 1994, and they had attained the best record in baseball prior 
to the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike that ended the season prematurely.[6] 
In 1994, Duquette returned to Massachusetts to become the General Manager 
of the Boston Red Sox. He spent eight years at the helm of his hometown 
team. The Red Sox achieved a record of 656–574 under Duquette, setting 
attendance records and appearing in the playoffs on three separate occasions 
(1995, 1998, and 1999). The team won the American League East division 
in 1995, but only advanced as far as the American League Championship Series 
once in their three postseason years. They would lose that series to the 
rival New York Yankees.[9] As the Red Sox GM, Duquette made several notable 
moves, including drafting Nomar Garciaparra in 1994[10] and trading for 
Pedro Martinez in 1997 (and signing him to a six-year, $75 million contract).[11] 
He is also known for letting Roger Clemens leave in free agency in 1996.[12] 
Many of the players that Duquette drafted or signed were on the Red Sox 
2004 World Series championship team. He is largely considered to have laid 
the groundwork for that team by signing and drafting players like Tim Wakefield, 
Johnny Damon, Jason Varitek, Manny Ramirez, Derek Lowe, and Kevin Youkilis.[6][11][12][13] 
In 2002, Duquette was dismissed from his general manager post less than 
24 hours after the Red Sox had officially been sold to a new ownership 
group that included John W. Henry and Tom Werner.[9][11] After his stint 
with the Red Sox, Duquette largely stayed out of Major League Baseball 
for 9 years. In 2003, he opened the Dan Duquette Sports Academy, a sports 
training center in Hinsdale, Massachusetts designed for children aged 8 
to 18.[14] In 2004, He became the owner of the New England Collegiate Baseball 
League's Pittsfield Dukes (later the Pittsfield American Defenders and 
now the Mystic Schooners). During his ownership tenure, the Dukes/American 
Defenders played at his sports academy in Hinsdale and later at Wahconah 
Park in Pittsfield. In 2008, he was part of an ownership group that included 
Buddy Lewis, Terry Allvord, and Jerry O'Connor that purchased what would 
become known as the American Defenders of New Hampshire, (later the Pittsfield 
Colonials). He relinquished ownership of both clubs in 2009 and 2010.[15][16] 
Duquette also helped found the Israel Baseball League. Despite folding 
after only one season, it helped 75 players get into professional baseball.[3][13][17] 
During this time, he also had a part in a production of the musical, Damn 
Yankees, in Western Massachusetts.[18] After spending 9 years away from 
the MLB, Duquette returned as the General Manager of the Baltimore Orioles 
in November 2011.[12] In 2012, the team made the playoffs for the first 
time since 1997. In 2014, the Orioles won the American League East with 
96 wins and made it to the American League Championship Series. Many people 
attribute the success of the Orioles to the management of Buck Showalter 
and Duquette.[3][4][19][20] Duquette signed Nelson Cruz to one-year, $8 
million contract in February 2014. Cruz went on to lead the league in home 
runs that year. Other signings and acquisitions under Duquette have included, 
Nick Hundley, Delmon Young, Steve Pearce, and Andrew Miller.[4] In early 
2015, the Toronto Blue Jays expressed interest in making Duquette their 
new President/CEO. Because Duquette is under contract until 2018 and the 
Blue Jays did not offer enough compensation to the Orioles, no deal was 
struck.[1][20] Duquette has twice received The Sporting News Executive 
of the Year Award (1992 with the Expos and 2014 with the Orioles).[4] He 
also won the Baseball America Major League Executive of the Year honor 
in 2014 with the Orioles.[19] Mark Armour and Daniel Levitt ranked Duquette 
the 17th best general manager in the history of baseball in their 2015 
book, In Pursuit of Pennants: Baseball Operations from Deadball to Moneyball.[21] 
Duquette is married to Amy Aubry-Duquette and has six children. He lived 
in Acton, Massachusetts, from 1994 through 2011.[22] He currently lives 
in Pasadena, Maryland.[17] Duquette's cousin, Jim Duquette, is a former 
executive of the Baltimore Orioles and the New York Mets.[23] His other 
cousin, Pat Duquette (Jim's brother), is the head men's basketball coach
