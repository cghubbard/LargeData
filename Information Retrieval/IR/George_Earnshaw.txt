George "Moose" Earnshaw (February 15, 1900 – December 1, 1976) was a Major 
League Baseball pitcher. He played in parts of nine seasons (1928–36) with 
the Philadelphia Athletics, Chicago White Sox, Brooklyn Dodgers, and St. 
Louis Cardinals. He was the American League wins leader in 1929 with the 
A's. For his career, he compiled a 127–93 record in 319 appearances, with 
a 4.38 ERA and 1,002 strikeouts. Earnshaw played on three American League 
pennant winners with the Athletics, winning the World Series in 1929 and 
1930. George Livingston Earnshaw was born February 15, 1900, in New York 
City. He grew to be 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) and 210 pounds. George's nickname 
was "Moose." He was aggressive, threw hard, and threw strikes. His career 
covered nine years with a total of 127 victories, and over half of Earnshaw's 
victories occurred during the A's pennant winning years 1929–31. He won 
a total of four World Series games, starting eight games with five being 
complete games. He struck out 56 batters in 62 innings pitched and had 
an ERA for the three Series of 1.58. Connie Mack gave more credit to George 
Earnshaw for the Athletics' 1930 World Series victory over the St. Louis 
Cardinals than any other player. Earnshaw did not reach the majors until 
he was 28 years old. A graduate of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, 
he was a pitching star for the minor league Baltimore Orioles when Connie 
Mack purchased his contract in June 1928. That season, the A's finished 
second in the American League, 2½ games behind the Yankees. Moose had a 
record of 7–7 with a 3.85 ERA and 117 strikeouts in 158 innings pitched. 
It was in 1929 that Earnshaw and Lefty Grove began to dominate big league 
hitters. For the next three years, they were the only two pitchers on any 
one team to win 20 or more games. The 1929 season was George's turn to 
shine. His 24 victories against 8 losses was the most in the majors, and 
his 149 strikeouts were second only to teammate Grove in the American League 
and third in the majors. His fastball being wild at times, George's 125 
walks were an American League high, but his 3.28 ERA was among the best. 
By 1936, George Earnshaw's career came to an end, ironically, playing with 
the St. Louis Cardinals and old nemesis Pepper Martin. Within a few years, 
George would become a Commander in the Navy in World War II. On December 
1, 1976, Earnshaw died in Little Rock, Arkansas. He currently ranks seventh 
in Athletics franchise history in winning percentage (.627). Babe Ruth 
once said of Earnshaw, "I used to send a taxicab to the Almanac Hotel the 
day he was gonna pitch. I didn't want him to get lost on the way to the
