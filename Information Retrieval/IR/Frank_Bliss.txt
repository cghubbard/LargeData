Frank Eugene Bliss (December 10, 1852 â€“ January 9, 1929) was an American 
baseball player. He played college baseball at the University of Michigan 
from 1869 to 1873 and played for the Milwaukee Grays in Major League Baseball 
during the 1878 season. Bliss was born in Chicago in 1852. He moved with 
his parents, Edwin J. Bliss (a carpenter) and Mary (Osborne) Bliss, to 
Ann Arbor, Michigan at age five and attended the public schools in Ann 
Arbor, graduating from high school in 1869.[1][2][3][4][5] Bliss enrolled 
at the University of Michigan as a civil engineering student in 1869. He 
played college baseball there as a catcher from 1869 to 1873.[3][6][7][8] 
Teammate Frederick Stearns said of Bliss: "He was a wonder. Besides being 
a great catcher, he had the unusual distinction of always playing with 
his trousers tucked in long boots."[9][10] Baseball historian Peter Morris 
has cited Bliss's use of long boots as an early innovation of protective 
gear for catchers, i.e., an early form of shin guards.[11] Bliss graduated 
from the University of Michigan in June 1873 with a degree in civil engineering.[2][12] 
Bliss worked as a civil engineer from 1873 to 1875 in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, 
and Detroit.[3] In the fall of 1877, he returned to the University of Michigan 
as a student in the law department and received an LL.B. degree in the 
spring of 1879.[2] In 1876, Bliss was the catcher and team captain on the 
West End Club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. An account of the 1876 West Enders 
noted that Bliss was a fine catcher "with great skill and nerve and throws 
to the bases with notable accuracy."[13] The 1876 West Enders played seven 
games against teams from the National League.[13] After the 1876 season, 
Bliss sued the West End Club claiming that the team had agreed to pay him 
$1,300 but paid him less than $300. No record has been found of the lawsuit's 
outcome.[14] During the summer of 1877, Bliss played for minor league teams 
in Janesville, Wisconsin, and Buffalo, New York.[15] In June 1878, the 
Milwaukee Grays lost their catchers to injuries and signed Bliss. Bliss 
was a law student at Michigan at the time, but he left school to join the 
Grays. Bliss made his Major League Baseball debut on June 20, 1878, as 
the battery mate to pitcher Mike Golden. Bliss was responsible for seven 
errors, including six passed balls, in the game.[16] Two days later, he 
appeared in his second and final game for the Grays, this time as a third 
baseman. In two games for the Grays, Bliss had one hit and scored one run 
in eight at bats and compiled a .124 batting average.[1][17] Bliss was 
the first Michigan Wolverines baseball player to play in Major League Baseball.[18] 
Bliss was admitted to the Michigan bar in 1879. He began practicing law 
in Cleveland with the Herrick & Herrick firm. In 1881, he married Louisa 
Sarah Fish and moved to Brooklyn, Ohio. He continued to practice law in 
Cleveland. He served for several years as a member of Brooklyn's village 
council and was elected mayor of Brooklyn Village in 1888.[2][19] Bliss 
and his wife Louisa had four children, Frank Bronson Bliss (b. 1883), Carl 
Edwin Bliss (b. 1885), Eugene Frederick Bliss (b. 1887) and Louise Mary 
Bliss (b. 1889).[20] Bliss died of pneumonia, with influenza a contributing
