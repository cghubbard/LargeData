The 1967 Chicago White Sox season was the team's 67th season in the major 
leagues, and its 68th season overall. They finished with a record 89–73, 
good enough for fourth place in the American League, 3 games behind the 
first-place Boston Red Sox. The Sockless Sox hit only .225, but they had 
a pitching staff that carried the team to a near miraculous American League 
pennant that year. they were led by Joe Horlen who won 19 games, and pitched 
a no-hitter on September 10 against the Detroit Tigers. He had a league-leading 
2.06 ERA. The pitching staff was the trump card that landed the White Sox 
in first place on June 10. They held the lead until a heartbreaking loss 
to the Minnesota Twins knocked them into second place on August 13. Thereafter 
it was a four-team dogfight. Sinker-ball specialist Bob Locker teamed with 
Hoyt Wilhelm and Don McMahon, an early-season pickup, to form the nucleus 
of a tough bullpen. With assembly-line precision, pitching coach Ray Berres 
"manufactured" live, young arms and rejuvenated the veterans. Berres had 
supervised the Sox pitchers for 19 years until Eddie Stanky replaced him 
with Marv Grissom in 1967. Ed Short burned up the telephone lines seeking 
a capable hitter to beef up the punchless attack. Jim King, Ken Boyer, 
and Rocky Colavito arrived via the waiver route, but those were desultory 
moves that upset the delicate chemistry of the ballclub and hurt the morale 
of the younger players coming down the homestretch. The fate of the White 
Sox hung in the balance on September 27 – 'Black Wednesday' – in Kansas 
City. playing in that city for the final time before moving on to Oakland 
for 1968, Charlie Finleys doormat A's knocked off the Sox in a twi-night 
doubleheader. Stankey's team needed only a split of the 2 games to place 
them in an enviable position going into the final 3 days of the season. 
The other contenders had all lost that day including the Boston Red Sox. 
Their 89 win season was their 17th consecutive first-division finish. It 
would be 5 years before the White Sox had a winning season again and 16 
years before the White Sox had a chance to make it to the postseason. [1]
