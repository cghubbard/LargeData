Charles Wesley Bennett (November 21, 1854 – February 24, 1927) was an American 
professional baseball player from 1875 or 1876 through the 1893 season. 
He played 15 years in Major League Baseball, principally as a catcher, 
with the Milwaukee Grays (49 games, 1878), Worcester Ruby Legs (51 games, 
1880), Detroit Wolverines (625 games, 1881–1888) and Boston Beaneaters 
(337 games, 1889–1893). He played on four pennant-winning teams, one in 
Detroit and three in Boston, and is one of only two players (the other 
being Ned Hanlon) to play with the Detroit Wolverines during all eight 
seasons of the club's existence. Bennett compiled a .256 batting average 
and a .340 on-base percentage during his major league career with 549 runs 
scored, 203 doubles, 67 triples, 55 home runs and 533 runs batted in (RBIs). 
His greatest value, however, was as one of the greatest defensive players 
of his era. Between 1880 and 1891, he ranked among the National League 
leaders 10 times in Defensive Wins Above Replacement (Defensive WAR) at 
all positions and led the league's catchers seven times in fielding percentage 
and three times in double plays and putouts.[1] Bennett's baseball career 
ended in January 1894 when he lost both legs in a train accident in Kansas. 
In 1896, Detroit's new baseball stadium was named Bennett Park in his honor. 
The Detroit Tigers played their home games at Bennett Park from 1896 through 
the 1911 season. Bennett has also been credited with inventing the first 
chest protector, an improvised cork-lined vest that he wore under his uniform. 
Bennett was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, in 1854.[1] His father, Silas 
Bennett (1815–1887), was a native of Connecticut. His mother, Catherine 
(Nichols) Bennett, was a native of Pennsylvania. Charlie was the eighth 
of their 11 children.[2][3] Bennett began his career in organized baseball 
as the catcher for the Neshannock team in the Pennsylvania League.[4] Sources 
are in conflict as to how long Bennett played for Neshannock, one account 
indicating he was on the Neshannocks' "pay roll for two seasons",[5] and 
others stating that he played for the Neshannocks in 1874, 1875 and 1876.[6][7] 
Bennett was described while playing for the Neshannocks as a hard hitter 
who "nearly broke the directors of the club because of the number of balls 
knocked into the Shenango river."[7][8] While playing for Neshannock, Bennett 
was the catcher for Cal Hawk, one of the pitching stars of the early 1870s.[9] 
At the end of the 1876 season, at age 22, Bennett signed with the Detroit 
Aetnas. The Aetnas were originally an amateur baseball team, but the club 
signed several professional players at the end of the 1876 season to aid 
in a rivalry with the Cass Club of Detroit. The professional players signed 
by the Aetnas included three members of the Neshannock team—Bennett, George 
Creamer and Ned Williamson.[8][10] Bennett's first appearance for the Aetnas 
was on September 21, 1876, against the Boston Red Stockings at the Woodward 
Avenue grounds in Detroit. Bennett played third base in the game and, in 
the first inning, hit a "hot one" that glanced off the pitcher and continued 
into center field for a triple that drove in a run.[11] The Aetnas' professional 
players, including Bennett, remained until the end of the season and were 
"stranded" in Detroit "without a dollar", until a "benefit was given and 
enough money realized to pay their way home."[10] Some sources state that 
Bennett signed with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1877 and played in one 
game for that team.[12] He ultimately signed a contract to play in 1877 
for the Milwaukee club at a salary of $150 per month.[5] During Bennett's 
first season with Milwaukee, the team was part of the League Alliance, 
which has been classified as a minor league.[13] The following year, the 
Milwaukee club was admitted to the National League and became the Milwaukee 
Grays. Bennett made his major league debut on May 1, 1878, and appeared 
in 49 games, 35 as a catcher and 20 in the outfield. He compiled a .245 
batting average for the Grays with 16 runs scored and 12 RBIs.[1] His battery-mate, 
Sam Weaver lost 31 games that season.[14] In 1879, after the Milwaukee 
club disbanded,[4] Bennett joined the Worcester Ruby Legs, a team organized 
and managed by Frank Bancroft. The team played in the National Association, 
which has been rated as having been a minor league in 1879. Bennett began 
at Worcester as a backup catcher to Doc Bushong, but eventually replaced 
Bushong.[5] Bennett hit .328 in 42 games during the 1879 season.[13] During 
the winter of 1879–1880, Bancroft took his team, including Bennett, on 
a baseball tour of Cuba and the Southern United States. Bennett stayed 
in New Orleans and played for local baseball teams there until the 1880 
season began.[15] In 1880, Worcester was admitted to the National League, 
replacing the Syracuse Stars, and attaining major league status.[6] That 
season, Bennett appeared in 51 games, 45 of them as the team's catcher.[1] 
Bennett caught for Lee Richmond, baseball's first left-handed pitching 
star.[5] Richmond compiled a 32-32 record in 1880,[16] and also pitched 
the first perfect game in major league history, with Bennnett catching. 
Bennett had a .228 batting average with 20 runs scored and 18 RBIs during 
the 1880 season. Defensively, he ranked second among the National League's 
catchers with a .913 fielding percentage and fifth in putouts and range 
factor.[1] At the end of the 1880 season, George Bancroft, who had been 
Bennett's manager in Worcester, signed as the manager of a new Detroit 
baseball club that was admitted to play in the National League starting 
in 1881. Bancroft brought several Worcester players with him, including 
Bennett, George Wood, and Lon Knight.[6] Bennett played eight seasons with 
the Detroit Wolverines. He was one of only two players, the other being 
Ned Hanlon, to play for the Wolverines during every season that the franchise 
existed. In his first season with Detroit, Bennett established himself 
as one of the best players in the National League. With a .301 batting 
average and a .478 slugging percentage,[1] Bennett's overall Wins Above 
Replacement (WAR) rating of 4.2 was the second highest among all of the 
league's position players, trailing only Cap Anson (5.8 WAR).[17] He also 
finished among the league leaders with seven home runs (2nd), 64 RBIs (2nd), 
.478 slugging percentage (4th), and 32 extra base hits (4th).[17] Bennett 
also excelled defensively in 1881, leading the league's catchers in putouts 
(418) and range factor (7.19), compiling the second highest Defensive WAR 
rating in the league, and setting a major league record for catchers with 
a .962 fielding percentage (.962). With his strong performance on both 
offense and defense, Bennett helped lead the Wolverines to a respectable 
41-43 record in the first season of the franchise's existence.[18] According 
to baseball historian Peter Morris, Bennett took the first recorded "curtain 
call" in baseball during the 1881 season. After hitting a home run in May 
1881, Bennett was "loudly applauded, and the crowd would not desist until 
he bowed in acknowledgment."[19] In 1882, Bennett had another strong season, 
batting .301 and compiling a 4.1 WAR rating that ranked sixth in the league 
among position players. He also ranked among the league leaders with a 
.450 slugging percentage (6th), 10 triples (10th), and five home runs (4th). 
Defensively, he led the league's catchers with 446 putouts and a 7.94 range 
factor.[1] Bennett was the Wolverines' dominant offensive player, and helped 
the team to its first winning record at 42-41.[20] In 1883, Bennett hit 
for a career high .305 batting average, and his 4.9 WAR rating was the 
third highest among the National League's position players, trailing only 
Dan Brouthers and Jack Farrell.[21] Bennett's defensive performance as 
dominant as his offense, with a 1.8 Defensive WAR rating that was the highest 
among catchers and the third highest among all players in the league.[21] 
He also led the league's catchers with 11 double plays turned and a .944 
fielding percentage.[1] As good as Bennett was in 1883, the Wolverines 
team was not good, dropping to seventh place with a 40-58 record.[22] In 
1884, matters got worse for the Wolverines, as they finished in last place 
with a 28-84 record.[23] Bennett's batting average fell to .264, but his 
on-base percentage remained high at .334, and his WAR rating remained strong 
at 4.1.[1] Bennett later recalled the toll of multiple losing seasons in 
Detroit: "During the next four years [1882–1885] I wished many times I 
was out of Detroit, or, rather, out of that team. It was awful. I thought 
sometimes we were lucky to finish last. Once we lost twenty-five straight 
games. Every week I caught a new pitcher."[24] In June 1885, the Wolverines 
added another slugger in Sam Thompson, and the team improved incrementally 
to sixth place with a 41-67 record.[25] Bennett compiled a 4.5 WAR rating 
for the season, the second highest of his career and fifth highest among 
the league's position players. He was also among the league leaders with 
42 extra base hits (4th), 47 bases on balls (5th), a .456 slugging percentage 
(6th), 24 doubles (6th), a .356 on-base percentage (7th), and 64 RBIs (10th).[1] 
Defensively, he led the league's catchers with a 7.00 range factor and 
ranked second in double plays (10), fielding percentage (.919) and putouts 
(347).[1] In 1886, the Wolverines added several star players and improved 
substantially, finishing in second place with a 85-38 record.[26] Bennett 
put in another solid year for the Wolverines with a .371 on-base percentage 
and a 3.9 WAR rating. He also compiled perhaps his best defensive season 
with a 2.0 Defensive WAR rating that was the highest among all players 
in the National League. He also led the league's catchers in fielding percentage 
(.955), double plays (13), and putouts (425), and ranked second in range 
factor (7.38).[1] The 1887 season was the pinnacle in the history of the 
Detroit Wolverines. The team won the National League pennant with a 79-45 
record and then defeated the St. Louis Browns in the 1887 World Series.[27] 
Bennett's WAR rating of 1.7 was the lowest during his time in Detroit, 
but still a respectable showing. Even though he was limited by injury to 
46 games during the regular season, Bennett still finished with the sixth 
highest Defensive WAR rating among all players in the league and compiled 
a .363 on-base percentage.[1] In his only World Series, Bennett had nine 
RBIs, 11 hits, and a triple, stole five bases, and scored six runs.[1] 
During the 1887 season, an excursion of fans from Bennett's home town in 
Pennsylvania traveled to watch Bennett play in Detroit. They presented 
him with a wheel barrow loaded with 500 silver dollars, which Bennett then 
wheeled around the field "to the delight of 5000 people."[12] During the 
1888 season, Bennett rebounded with one of the best seasons of his career. 
His overall 4.2 WAR rating was the third highest of Bennett's career, and 
his 2.2 Defensive WAR rating was the highest of his career and the second 
highest in the National League. Despite being the eighth oldest player 
in the league, he broke his own major league record with a .966 fielding 
percentage.[1] The Wolverines as a whole finished in fifth place with a 
68-63 record.[28] With high salaries owed to the team's star players, and 
gate receipts declining markedly, the team folded in October 1888 with 
the players being sold to other teams. On October 16, 1888, the Wolverines 
sold Bennett, Dan Brouthers, Charlie Ganzel, Hardy Richardson and Deacon 
White to the Boston Beaneaters for a price estimated at $30,000.[1] Bennett 
has been credited with inventing the first chest protector worn by catchers.[29] 
According to Bennett, his wife worried about his safety as "a target for 
the speed merchants" and saw a need for a form of body armor to protect 
her husband from broken ribs. Bennett and his wife designed a homemade 
shield by sewing thick strips of cork between layers of "heavy bedticking 
material." Out of a concern for spectators "roasting him for being chicken-hearted", 
he wore the device under his shirt.[30] During Bennett's era, catchers 
lacked the protective equipment present in 20th century baseball. It was 
not until 1888 that specialized catcher's mitts began to be used on the 
non-throwing hand.[31] As a result, catchers' hands, fingers, legs, and 
bodies took a beating in Bennett's time. For this reason, catchers in the 
era were not every-day players, needing time to recuperate after catching 
a game. When Bennett began his major league career, the major league record 
for games caught in a season was 63 games.[32] Most catchers of the 1870s 
and 1880s minimized wear and tear on their hands by playing some games 
at other positions. For example, the three "catchers" from the era who 
have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame each played less than 
half of their games as a catcher: (1) Buck Ewing, often cited as the greatest 
catcher of the 19th century, played only 636 of his 1,345 games (47%) as 
a catcher;[33] (2) King Kelly played only 583 of his 1,455 games (40%) 
at catcher;[34] and (3) Deacon White eventually moved to third base as 
his regular position, finishing his career with only 458 of 1,622 games 
(28%) as a catcher.[35] Bennett, on the other hand, played 954 of his 1,084 
games (88%) at the catcher position.[1][36] Bennett's durability came not 
from avoiding injuries, but from playing through them. When he broke another 
finger during the 1887 World Series, The New York Times reported: "It did 
not seem anything unusual to Bennett or his fingers. . . . When he held 
up that battered right hand, with its fingers swollen and spread like a 
boxing glove, with rags tied around three of them, and a general appearance 
of having been run over by a freight-car about the entire hand, it did 
not seem as though there were room to split it in any new place."[37] Accounts 
of Bennett's mangled or gnarled hands and fingers are common. In his book, 
Catcher: The Evolution of an American Folk Hero, Peter Morris cited one 
such account: Bennett 'declared that only a sissy would use a padded glove 
with the fingers and thumb cut off. During one of the games in which he 
figured a foul ball split the left thumb of Bennett's hand from the tip 
right down to the palm. The flesh was laid open right to the bone. A doctor 
who examined it immediately told Bennett that it would be necessary for 
him to quit the game until such time as the thumb healed sufficiently. 
The physician pointed out ... that blood poisoning might set in which would 
cause him the loss not only of the thumb but perhaps a hand or an arm. 
But despite all the doctor's caution Bennett remained in the game catching 
day after day with his horribly mangled finger. He kept a bottle of antiseptic 
and a wad of cotton batting on the bench and between innings would devote 
his time to washing out the wound.'[38] Another account arises out of the 
1889 pennant race. That year, Bennett played for the Boston Beaneaters 
in a close pennant race with the New York Giants. Bennett's hands had taken 
a beating while catching for John Clarkson, who won 49 games and pitched 
five games a week during the season. On the last day of the season, Boston 
had to win, and New York had to lose for Boston to finish in first place. 
By the sixth inning, second baseman Hardy Richardson told the manager, 
Jim Hart, that the ball was coming to him in a bloody state due to the 
condition of Bennett's hands. Bennett did not want to come out of the game, 
but Hart removed him over Bennett's protest, and Bennett "had to keep his 
hands in plasters for two weeks."[39] Despite the physical battering and 
breaking every finger on both hands, Bennett was able to continue catching 
for 20 years (1874–1893).[1][13] His total of 954 major league games at 
catcher stood as the record until 1897.[32] After a brief dispute with 
the Boston management with respect to his salary, Bennett signed a contract 
with the club In January 1889.[7] That year, Bennett appeared in 82 games, 
all at catcher. His batting average dropped to .231, his lowest tally since 
he was a part-time player in 1880. However, he continued to show his value 
defensively. Despite being the sixth oldest player in the National League, 
Bennett finished fifth among all players at all positions with a Defensive 
WAR of 1.4. He also led the league's catchers with a .955 fielding percentage, 
ranked second among the league's catchers with 419 putouts and third with 
nine double plays turned.[1] With Bennett's assistance, Boston pitcher 
John Clarkson compiled a 49-19 record, and the Beaneaters finished second 
in the league with an 83-45 record.[40] In 1890, Bennett remained with 
the Beaneaters even though he had in 1886 joined the Brotherhood of Professional 
Base-Ball Players, the union that represented the players and organized 
the Players' League in response to unfair treatment by team owners. As 
a member of the Brotherhood, his refusal to play in the Players' League 
was criticized by many of his fellow Brotherhood members. Hardy Richardson, 
a Brotherhood representative and former teammate of Bennett, stated that 
Bennett offered to sign with the Brotherhood only if he was given a three-year 
contract guaranteed by two responsible men.[41] Some reports indicated 
that former Detroit manager Robert Leadley was paid $1,000 to convince 
Bennett to remain with the Beaneaters and that Bennett was himself paid 
a substantial signing bonus.[12][41][42][43] Bennett later described his 
ambivalence about the Players' League: "I was a Brotherhood man from the 
first. Mrs. Bennett was strongly opposed to my going into it and before 
the season opened I told my friends that I could not join them, so I remained 
with the Boston Club. When I went into the Brotherhood it was a protective 
order and I had no idea that they intended organizing an association of 
their own."[44] Bennett became the catcher for Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher, 
Kid Nichols, in 1890, as Nichols compiled a 27-19 record while Clarkson 
went 26-18. The team finished in fifth place with a 76-57 record.[45] Offensively, 
Bennett's production continued to decline, as he finished the 1890 season 
with a .214 batting average. Though he had only 60 hits, he also drew 72 
bases on balls, boosting his on-base percentage to .377. Already the third 
oldest player in the league, Bennett nevertheless also continued to rank 
among the best defensive catchers. He led the league's catchers with a 
.959 fielding percentage and ranked fourth in putouts and double plays 
and fifth in assists and runners caught stealing.[1] In 1891, Bennett appeared 
in 75 games, all as a catcher, for a Boston team that won the National 
League pennant with an 87-51 record. The team had two 30-game winners, 
as John Clarkson won 33 and Kid Nichols won 30.[46] Bennett's batting average 
remained low at .215, but his .332 on-base percentage was significantly 
higher. Moreover, he led the National League in fielding percentage by 
a catcher for the seventh time in his career. He also led the league with 
10 double plays turned by a catcher.[1] In 1892, King Kelly took over as 
the Beaneaters' number one catcher. In a backup role, Bennett, at age 37, 
appeared in 35 games as Boston's catcher. The team continued to play well, 
winning its second consecutive National League pennant with a 102-48 record.[47] 
In 1893, Bennett returned to his role as the team's number one catcher, 
appearing in 60 games at the position. In that role, he helped Boston win 
its third consecutive National League pennant with an 86-43 record.[48] 
Bennett compiled a .209 batting average and .352 on-base percentage and 
appeared in what proved to be his final baseball game on September 30, 
1893.[1] While playing for Boston, Bennett returned each year to his home 
in Detroit for the off-season, and also traveled with his dog to Williamsburg, 
Kansas, for extended hunting trips. In 1894, Bennett was joined on his 
annual hunting trip by pitcher John Clarkson. On January 10, 1894, Bennett's 
legs were crushed by a Santa Fe Railroad passenger train in Wellsville, 
Kansas, while traveling from Kansas City to Williamsburg.[12] Bennett stepped 
off the train to talk to an old friend who lived in Kansas and whom Bennett 
had arranged to greet when the train stopped at Wellsville. It was raining, 
and the platform was wet. When the train started moving, Bennett "swung 
around to catch the railing", but his foot slipped, and his left foot went 
over the rail. Bennett pushed his right leg against the rail to push himself 
back, but it also slipped and went over the track. The train's wheels ran 
over his left foot and right leg at the knee.[24][44][49] That evening, 
doctors at the North Ottawa Hospital in Ottawa, Kansas, amputated Bennett's 
left leg just above the ankle and his right leg just above the knee.[42] 
In June 1894, he was fitted with artificial limbs, but his baseball career 
was over.[44] In August 1894, a benefit to raise money for Bennett was 
held at Boston's South End Grounds; the event included a baseball game 
between the Boston team and a team of collegiate players as well as foot 
races and other attractions.[50] The boxing champion Gentleman Jim Corbett 
attended and briefly played in left field with the Boston team. The benefit 
was attended by nearly 9,000 people and raised $6,000 for Bennett. Bennett 
walked to home plate during the event, aided by crutches and artificial 
limbs, and bowed to the crowd "until the grounds fairly shook with cheers."[51] 
During his 15 years in the major leagues, Bennett set numerous fielding 
records. Several of those records are set forth below. Sports writer Tim 
Murnane in 1894 declared Bennett "unquestionably the greatest back stop 
the game ever produced, taking his throwing and batting into consideration 
. . . Year after year Bennett led the catchers of the League and country 
until it seemed impossible to get a player to head him off. It made no 
difference to him who pitched the ball, he was there to catch it, and always 
with big hands. Who can remember Bennett dropping a pitched ball? Passed 
balls were a lost art when this man was behind the stick, and he was the 
ideal back stop. [Kid] Nichols always insisted on having him do his catching, 
saying that Bennett knew every batsman's weak points, and made easy work 
for the pitcher."[42] Pitcher Lee Richmond, whose perfect game Bennett 
caught in 1880, later stated that, among the catchers he had worked with, 
"my favorite was Charley Bennett, the best backstop that ever lived in 
the world. He went after everything, he knew no fear, he kept his pitcher 
from going into the air."[55] In The New Bill James Historical Baseball 
Abstract, sports historian Bill James wrote that Bennett was perhaps the 
best defensive catcher of the era. In comparing Bennett to Buck Ewing, 
James noted: "Buck Ewing was supposedly a brilliant catcher, but Bennett 
caught 50% more innings than Ewing, with a lot fewer mistakes: per 1000 
defensive innings, Ewing was charged with 59 errors and 66 passed balls, 
while Bennett was charged with 46 errors and 43 passed balls."[56] Although 
James ranked Ewing ahead of Bennett as an overall player, he chose Bennett 
as the catcher on his Gold Glove Team for the 1880s.[57] On the offensive 
side, Ewing compiled a .303 career batting average, 47 points higher than 
Bennett. However, with Bennett's talent for drawing walks, Ewing's career 
on-base percentage (.351) was only 11 points higher than Bennett (.340).[1][33] 
In 1882, Bennett was married to his wife, Alice, a Vermont native. They 
met while Bennett was playing for Worcester. They had no children,[12] 
and lived for more than 20 years at 67 Alexandria Street in Detroit,[58][59][60][61] 
and later at 1313 Delaware Avenue in Detroit.[62] After his injury, Bennett 
operated a cigar store in Detroit.[29] When Bennett first announced plans 
to open a cigar store, shortly after losing his legs, one woman wrote to 
him and said, "If Charley Bennett opens a cigar store in Detroit, all the 
ladies will commence smoking."[24] Bennett later took lessons in china 
painting and became quite proficient at the decorative art, first as a 
hobby and then as a supplemental source of income.[29][58][63] One writer 
wrote that the art of china painting was "the last thing one would expect 
in the world from a man whose hands have been battered out of shape and 
whose every finger has been broken."[58] The Sporting News wrote: "It was 
with characteristic patience that Bennett trained his distorted fingers 
in the delicate art of china painting."[29] When a new ballpark was opened 
in Detroit in 1896, it was named Bennett Park in his honor. Bennett caught 
the first pitch at Bennett Park in 1896. It became a Detroit tradition 
for Bennett to catch the first pitch in Detroit, an honor that Bennett 
continued for every home opener through 1926. In November 1926, Bennett 
underwent surgery at Grace Hospital in Detroit to remove "a superorbital 
abscess of the face."[62] He had been ill for several months before the 
surgery and never fully recovered afterward, as the poison from the abscess 
reportedly spread through Bennett's system. Bennett died in February 1927 
at age 72 at his home in Detroit. He was buried at Woodmere Cemetery in
