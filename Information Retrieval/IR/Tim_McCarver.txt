James Timothy "Tim" McCarver (born October 16, 1941) is an American sportscaster 
and former professional baseball catcher. McCarver played for the St. Louis 
Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies, Montreal Expos, and Boston Red Sox between 
1959 and 1980. He appeared in the MLB All-Star Game in 1966 and 1967, and 
was the starting catcher for the World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals 
in 1964 and 1967. McCarver was the recipient of the 2012 Ford C. Frick 
Award for broadcasting.[1] McCarver was born in Memphis, Tennessee. McCarver, 
following his years with Memphis' Christian Brothers High School, was signed 
by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1959. Playing with the Cardinals' minor league 
teams of Keokuk and Rochester, McCarver reached the MLB level for the first 
time at the age of only 17. He spent the 1960, 1961, and 1962 seasons shuttling 
between St. Louis and the minor league teams of Memphis, Charleston (West 
Virginia), and Atlanta. In 1963, he was called up to the majors for good. 
In 1964, his tiebreaking home run in the 10th inning won Game 5 of the 
World Series. In 1966, McCarver was named to the All-Star Team, scored 
the winning run in the 10th inning of that 1966 All-Star Game, and became 
the first catcher to lead the National League in triples, with 13. In 1967, 
he finished second to teammate Orlando Cepeda for the National League Most 
Valuable Player award. McCarver was a member of two World Series championships 
during his time in St. Louis. He was the favorite catcher of the notoriously 
temperamental Bob Gibson, and fostered a relationship with young pitcher 
Steve Carlton that would keep him in the major leagues later in his career. 
In 1968, he was the Cardinals catcher as they took the NL pennant but lost 
to the Detroit Tigers in a seven-game World Series after being up 3 games 
to 1, the Tigers being only one of 5 MLB teams to accomplish that feat. 
After a trade to Philadelphia involving, among others, his teammate Curt 
Flood (which led to Flood's dramatic lawsuit over baseball's reserve clause) 
before the 1970 season, McCarver played for the Phillies, Expos, Red Sox, 
and another brief stint with the Cardinals (he was replaced on the roster 
by the rookie Keith Hernandez). McCarver's career might have taken a different 
turn in 1975, when, according to Peter Gammons, McCarver (then 33 and Boston's 
third-string catcher) was rumored as a potential managerial replacement 
for struggling skipper Darrell Johnson. McCarver, however, was released 
(to return to the Phillies), and Johnson led the Red Sox to the '75 AL 
pennant.[2] During his first stint with the Phillies, McCarver caught Rick 
Wise's no-hitter on June 23, 1971.[3] At the end of the season, the Phillies 
traded Wise to the Cardinals for Steve Carlton, the deal reuniting McCarver 
with Carlton. During the 1972 season, the Phillies traded McCarver to the 
Montreal Expos where, on October 2, he caught the second of Bill Stoneman's 
two career no-hitters.[4] On July 4, 1976, McCarver hit what is known as 
a "Grand Slam Single" when, after hitting a grand slam, he passed his teammate 
Garry Maddox on the basepath. While hosting the HBO special The Not-so-Great 
Moments in Sports, McCarver later claimed to have said to the umpire, "I 
didn't pass him, he lapped me." Asked how Maddox could have done that, 
McCarver replied, "Sheer speed." The event was commemorated in the book 
The Baseball Hall of Shame 3 as "Tim McCarver's Grand Sob." McCarver finished 
his career as the personal catcher for Steve Carlton for the Phillies in 
the late 1970s. Carlton preferred McCarver to Phillies regular Bob Boone. 
It was quipped that when Carlton and McCarver eventually died, they would 
be buried 60 feet, 6 inches apart. He retired after the 1979 season to 
begin a broadcasting career. McCarver briefly returned to duty in September 
1980, thus becoming one of only 29 players in baseball history to date 
to appear in Major League games in four different decades (1950s, 1960s, 
1970s and 1980s). He caught 121 shutouts during his career, ranking him 
9th all-time among major league catchers.[5] As a broadcaster, McCarver 
has enjoyed prominence as a color commentator on the network level. He 
has won three Emmy Awards for Sports Event Analyst. He began his broadcasting 
career at WPHL-TV (Channel 17) in Philadelphia, where he was paired with 
Richie Ashburn and Harry Kalas for Phillies games, before co-hosting HBO's 
Race for the Pennant in 1978 and working as a backup Game of the Week commentator 
for NBC in 1980. McCarver has called baseball for all four major U.S. television 
networks. His work at NBC was followed by stints with ABC (where he teamed 
with Don Drysdale on backup Monday Night Baseball games in 1984 and Al 
Michaels and Jim Palmer from 1985–1989 and again from 1994–1995 under the 
"Baseball Network" umbrella) and CBS (where he teamed with Jack Buck from 
1990–1991 and Sean McDonough from 1992–1993). McCarver was paired with 
Joe Buck on the Fox network's MLB telecasts, a role he held from 1996 to 
2013. McCarver called his first World Series in 1985 for ABC as a last 
minute replacement for Howard Cosell. Cosell had been removed from the 
broadcasts altogether after excerpts from his controversial book I Never 
Played the Game (which was critical of Cosell's co-workers at ABC Sports) 
appeared in TV Guide. Perhaps McCarver's most notable assignment for ABC 
prior to the 1985 World Series was as a field reporter for the 1984 National 
League Championship Series. Also while at ABC, he also served as a correspondent 
and play-by-play announcer for Freestyle skiing at the 1988 Winter Olympics 
in Calgary. McCarver also co-hosted the prime time coverage of 1992 Winter 
Olympics with Paula Zahn for CBS. He has also called games locally for 
the Phillies from 1980 to 1982, Mets from 1983 to 1998, Yankees from 1999 
to 2001, and Giants in 2002. However, McCarver wasn't able to call the 
World Series wins by the Phillies in 1980, Mets in 1986, and Yankees in 
1999 (all three wins were broadcast on NBC, but McCarver wasn't part of 
the broadcasting team any of those times). McCarver is the only sportscaster 
to have covered the New York Mets and two of their rivals on a regular 
basis. He is one of three sportscasters to have covered the Mets and the 
Yankees (the others being Fran Healy and Tom Seaver) and one of three sportscasters 
to have covered both the Mets and the Phillies (the others being Todd Kalas 
and Tom McCarthy). In 2003, McCarver set a record by broadcasting his 13th 
World Series on national television (surpassing Curt Gowdy); in all, he 
called 24 Fall Classics for ABC, CBS, and Fox. Also, from 1984 (when he 
served as a field reporter for ABC's NLCS coverage) to 2013 (when he served 
as color analyst for Fox's coverage of the ALCS), McCarver never missed 
commentating on at least one League Championship Series per year. McCarver 
announced March 27, 2013 that he would leave Fox after the 2013 season.[6] 
His final Fox broadcast was October 30, 2013, as the Boston Red Sox defeated 
the St. Louis Cardinals in game 6 to win the 2013 World Series.[7] On December 
8, 2013 he was hired to be a part-time analyst for the Cardinals on Fox 
Sports Midwest.[8] He teamed with Dan McLaughlin to call 30 games in the 
2014 season.[9] His first game called for the Cardinals was on April 28, 
2014, when they hosted the Milwaukee Brewers. At the conclusion of the 
season, McCarver stated that he had not yet decided whether to come back 
to the Cardinals' booth in 2015.[10] However, McCarver returned to the 
Cardinals booth for 40 games in 2015. In 2016, McCarver returned to the 
Cardinals booth once more. McCarver has also hosted a nationally-syndicated 
sports interview program, The Tim McCarver Show, since 2000. McCarver has 
elicited criticism throughout his broadcasting career. While covering the 
Mets, McCarver criticized Darryl Strawberry for staying in the same place 
in the outfield, and overly deep, regardless of the hitter at bat. He often 
said Strawberry would be better defensively if he made some adjustments. 
Davey Johnson, the Mets manager at the time, responded by saying that Strawberry 
saw the ball come off the bat better in that spot than anywhere else. During 
the 1992 National League Championship Series, he criticized Deion Sanders, 
who also had become an NFL star, for playing both sports on the same day. 
For his criticism, Sanders dumped a bucket of water on McCarver three times 
while he was covering the National League pennant winning Atlanta Braves' 
clubhouse celebration for CBS. After receiving the water, McCarver shouted 
at Sanders, "You are a real man, Deion. I'll say that."[11] Also during 
the 1992 post-season (when McCarver worked for CBS), Norman Chad criticized 
McCarver in Sports Illustrated by saying that he's someone who "when you 
ask him the time, will tell you how a watch works", a reference to McCarver's 
habit of over-analyzing. In Game 4 of the 1997 American League Championship 
Series, on a wild pitch with runners dashing around the bases, when umpire 
Durwood Merrill gestured to where the ball was, McCarver sarcastically 
commented that "maybe he was trying to tell himself where the ball is!" 
Merrill took offense to the comment, and fired back in his autobiography 
that he was letting the other umpires know that the situation was under 
control. When rule questions came up during a broadcast, McCarver misstated 
a rule. After a St. Louis Cardinals balk in Game 4 of the 2006 NLCS, McCarver 
explained, "You have to have 'one thousand one' when coming to a stop, 
and you have to stop your glove in the same place every time in front of 
your body," when the rules state that there must be merely a complete discernible 
stop anywhere in front of the pitcher's body; no certain duration or location 
is necessary.[12] In October 2008, just before the 2008 NLCS, McCarver 
made public his feelings about Manny Ramirez, calling him "despicable" 
and criticizing Ramirez for his perceived sloppy, lazy play in Boston and 
how he had suddenly turned it around in Los Angeles. Ramirez declined comment.[13] 
In 2010, he compared the New York Yankees treatment of former manager Joe 
Torre to the treatment meted out by Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia to 
generals who fell out of favour with their leaders. After receiving negative 
comments on his position, McCarver apologized.[14] On October 9, 2009, 
McCarver released a cover album of jazz standards entitled Tim McCarver 
Sings Songs from the Great American Songbook.[15][16] In 2010, McCarver 
was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame.[17] In July 
2012, he was elected to the broadcaster's wing in the Hall of Fame.[1]

Stadium in 1978; it was replaced by a new downtown stadium (named AutoZone
