Washington, DC has been home to over a dozen baseball organizations since 
1872 and is currently represented by the Washington Nationals. The first 
professional baseball teams and leagues formed in the late 19th century 
and several were based in Washington, DC. Many early teams used the names 
"Nationals" and "Senators" but were otherwise unrelated organizations. 
Washington was continuously home to a major league baseball team from 1901 
until 1971. Two separate franchises alternated between the nicknames "Senators" 
and "Nationals" and sometimes used the names interchangeably. Since the 
expansion franchise began play the year immediately after the original 
franchise's final year in Washington, and because they both used the same 
nickname, the teams are commonly confused or combined and photographs are 
often dated based on player uniforms. The original club used dark blue 
as its primary color, with a thick, sans-serif, red or white block "W" 
on it caps. The expansion club mainly used caps with a stylized cursive 
"W," first in blue with a red letter (1963–1967), then in red with a white 
letter (1968–1971), similar to current Washington Nationals. In 1961–1962, 
the expansion Senators wore dark blue caps with a sans-serif block "W" 
outlined in white, nearly identical to the caps of the original Senators 
save for a red button at the top of the cap. Varying shades of the Senators' 
red, white and blue colors are still used by their successor teams in Minnesota 
and Texas.[2] Two other teams also competed in Washington during this time 
period. Major league baseball returned to Washington in 2005 after a 33-year 
absence. The Nationals adopted similar colors to 1968-1972 Senators adding 
gold accents to a tilted version of the expansion Senators cursive "W" 
logo. In 2012, the Nationals were NL East Division Champions and brought 
postseason baseball to Washington D.C. for the first time in 79 years. 
In 2014, the Washington Nationals won their second NL East Division Championship 
in 3 years after defeating the Atlanta Braves 3-0 on September 16, 2014. 
In the NLDS of the same year, the Nationals would lose to the San Francisco
