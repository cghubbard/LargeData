Mamie "Peanut" Johnson (born September 27, 1935) was one of three women, 
and the first female pitcher, to play in the Negro Leagues. She was born 
in Ridgeway, South Carolina in 1935. She was signed by the Indianapolis 
Clowns in 1953, played with the team from 1953 to 1955, had a 33–8 won-loss 
record and a batting average of .273.[1] Johnson was known as "Peanut" 
during her career due to her height—5 feet, 3 inches.[2] She is the subject 
of the book A Strong Right Arm, describing her life growing up and the 
obstacles to her becoming a professional Negro League baseball player. 
After retiring, she went to nursing school and became a nurse for 30 years.[3] 
On June 5, 2008, Johnson and other living players from the Negro League 
Era were drafted by major league franchises prior to the 2008 MLB First
