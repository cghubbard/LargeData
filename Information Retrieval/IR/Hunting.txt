Hunting is the practice of killing or trapping some animal, or pursuing 
or tracking it with the intent of doing so. Hunting wildlife or feral animals 
is most commonly done by humans for food, recreation, to remove predators 
that are dangerous to humans or domestic animals, or for trade. Lawful 
hunting is distinguished from poaching, which is the illegal killing, trapping 
or capture of the hunted species. The species that are hunted are referred 
to as game or prey and are usually mammals and birds. Hunting can also 
be a means of pest control. Hunting advocates state that hunting can be 
a necessary component[1] of modern wildlife management, for example, to 
help maintain a population of healthy animals within an environment's ecological 
carrying capacity when natural checks such as predators are absent or very 
rare.[2] However, hunting has also heavily contributed to the endangerment, 
extirpation and extinction of many animals.[3] The pursuit, capture and 
release, or capture for food of fish is called fishing, which is not commonly 
categorised as a form of hunting. It is also not considered hunting to 
pursue animals without intent to kill them, as in wildlife photography, 
birdwatching, or scientific research activities which involve tranquilizing 
and/or tagging of animals or birds. The practice of foraging or gathering 
materials from plants and mushrooms is also considered separate from hunting. 
Skillful tracking and acquisition of an elusive target has caused the word 
hunt to be used in the vernacular as a metaphor, as in treasure hunting, 
"bargain hunting", and even "hunting down corruption and waste". Hunting 
has a long history and may well pre-date the rise of the species Homo sapiens. 
While our earliest Hominid ancestors were probably frugivores or omnivores, 
there is evidence that earlier Homo species,[4][5] and possibly also australopithecine[6] 
species, utilised larger animals for subsistence. Evidence from western 
Kenya suggests that hunting has been occurring for more than two million 
years.[7] Furthermore, evidence exists that hunting may have been one of 
the multiple environmental factors leading to extinctions of the holocene 
megafauna and their replacement by smaller herbivores.[8] North American 
megafauna extinction was coincidental with the Younger Dryas impact event, 
possibly making hunting a less critical factor in prehistoric species loss 
than had been previously thought.[9] However, in other locations such as 
Australia, humans are thought to have played a very significant role in 
the extinction of the Australian megafauna that was widespread prior to 
human occupation.[10][11] The closest surviving relatives of the human 
species are the two species of Pan: the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) 
and bonobos (Pan paniscus). Common chimpanzees have an omnivorous diet 
that includes troop hunting behaviour based on beta males being led by 
an alpha male. Bonobos have also been observed to occasionally engage in 
group hunting,[12] but eat a mostly frugivorous diet.[13] While it is undisputed 
that early humans were hunters, the importance of this for the emergence 
of the Homo genus from the earlier Australopithecines, including the production 
of stone tools and eventually the control of fire, are emphasised in the 
hunting hypothesis and de-emphasised in scenarios that stress omnivory 
and social interaction, including mating behaviour, as essential in the 
emergence of human behavioural modernity. With the establishment of language, 
culture, and religion, hunting became a theme of stories and myths, as 
well as rituals such as dance and animal sacrifice. Archaeological evidence 
found in present-day Germany documents that wooden spears have been used 
for hunting since at least 400,000 years ago,[14] and a 2012 study suggests 
that Homo heidelbergensis may have developed the technology about 500,000 
years ago.[15] Wood does not preserve well, however, and Craig Stanford, 
a primatologist and professor of anthropology at the University of Southern 
California, has suggested that the discovery of spear use by chimpanzees 
probably means that early humans used wooden spears as well, perhaps, five 
million years ago.[16] Hunting was a crucial component of hunter-gatherer 
societies before the domestication of livestock and the dawn of agriculture, 
beginning about 11,000 years ago. By the Mesolithic, hunting strategies 
had diversified with the development of the bow 18,000 years ago and the 
domestication of the dog about 15,000 years ago. Evidence puts the earliest 
known mammoth hunting in Asia with spears to approximately 16,200 years 
ago.[17] Many species of animals have been hunted throughout history. It 
has been suggested that in North America and Eurasia, caribou and wild 
reindeer "may well be the species of single greatest importance in the 
entire anthropological literature on hunting"[18] (see also Reindeer Age), 
although the varying importance of different species would depend on the 
geographic location. Hunter-gathering lifestyles remained prevalent in 
some parts of the New World, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Siberia, as well as 
all of Australia, until the European Age of Discovery. They still persist 
in some tribal societies, albeit in rapid decline. Peoples that preserved 
paleolithic hunting-gathering until the recent past include some indigenous 
peoples of the Amazonas (Ach√©), some Central and Southern African (San 
people), some peoples of New Guinea (Fayu), the Mlabri of Thailand and 
Laos, the Vedda people of Sri Lanka, and a handful of uncontacted peoples. 
In Africa, one of the last remaining hunter-gatherer tribes are the Hadza 
of Tanzania.[19] Archaeologist Louis Binford criticised the idea that early 
hominids and early humans were hunters. On the basis of the analysis of 
the skeletal remains of the consumed animals, he concluded that hominids 
and early humans were mostly scavengers, not hunters,[20] and this idea 
is popular among some archaeologists and paleoanthropologists. Robert Blumenschine 
proposed the idea of confrontational scavenging,[21] which involves challenging 
and scaring off other predators after they have made a kill, which he suggests 
could have been the leading method of obtaining protein-rich meat by early 
humans. Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after 
the development of agriculture, hunting was usually a significant contributor 
to the human food supply. The supplementary meat and materials from hunting 
included protein, bone for implements, sinew for cordage, fur, feathers, 
rawhide and leather used in clothing. Man's earliest hunting weapons would 
have included rocks, spears, the atlatl, and bows and arrows. Hunting is 
still vital in marginal climates, especially those unsuited for pastoral 
uses or agriculture.[citation needed] For example, Inuit people in the 
Arctic trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of sea mammals 
to make kayaks, clothing, and footwear. On ancient reliefs, especially 
from Mesopotamia, kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such 
as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a war chariot. The cultural 
and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented 
by deities such as the horned god Cernunnos and lunar goddesses of classical 
antiquity, the Greek Artemis or Roman Diana. Taboos are often related to 
hunting, and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could 
be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a reserve surrounding a temple. 
Euripides' tale of Artemis and Actaeon, for example, may be seen as a caution 
against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting. With the domestication 
of the dog, birds of prey, and the ferret, various forms of animal-aided 
hunting developed, including venery (scent hound hunting, such as fox hunting), 
coursing (sight hound hunting), falconry, and ferreting. While these are 
all associated with medieval hunting, over time, various dog breeds were 
selected for very precise tasks during the hunt, reflected in such names 
as pointer and setter. Even as agriculture and animal husbandry became 
more prevalent, hunting often remained as a part of human culture where 
the environment and social conditions allowed. Hunter-gatherer societies 
persisted, even when increasingly confined to marginal areas. And within 
agricultural systems, hunting served to kill animals that prey upon domestic 
and wild animals or to attempt to extirpate animals seen by humans as competition 
for resources such as water or forage. When hunting moved from a subsistence 
activity to a social one, two trends emerged: The meaning of the word game 
in Middle English evolved to include an animal which is hunted. As game 
became more of a luxury than a necessity, the stylised pursuit of it also 
became a luxury. Dangerous hunting, such as for lions or wild boars, often 
done on horseback or from a chariot, had a function similar to tournaments 
and manly sports. Hunting ranked as an honourable, somewhat competitive 
pastime to help the aristocracy practice skills of war in times of peace.[22] 
In most parts of medieval Europe, the upper class obtained the sole rights 
to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory. Game in these areas was 
used as a source of food and furs, often provided via professional huntsmen, 
but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy. 
The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the Robin 
Hood legends, in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is 
that they "hunt the King's deer". In contrast, settlers in Anglophone colonies 
gloried democratically in hunting for all.[23] In Medieval Europe, hunting 
was considered by Johannes Scotus Eriugena to be part of the set of seven 
mechanical arts.[24] Although various other animals have been used to aid 
the hunter, such as ferrets, the dog has assumed many very important uses 
to the hunter. The domestication of the dog has led to a symbiotic relationship 
in which the dog's independence from humans is deferred. Though dogs can 
survive independently of humans, and in many cases do, as with feral dogs, 
where hunger is not a primary factor, the species tends to defer to human 
control in exchange for habitation, food and support. Dogs today are used 
to find, chase, retrieve, and sometimes to kill the game. Hunting dogs 
allow humans to pursue and kill prey that would otherwise be very difficult 
or dangerous to hunt. Different breeds of dogs are used for different types 
of hunting. Waterfowl are commonly hunted using retrieving dogs such as 
the Labrador Retriever, the Golden Retriever, the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, 
the Brittany Spaniel, and other similar breeds. Game birds are flushed 
out using flushing spaniels such as the English Springer Spaniel, the various 
Cocker Spaniels and similar breeds. The hunting of wild mammals in England 
and Wales with dogs was banned under the Hunting Act 2004. The wild mammals 
include fox, hare, deer and mink. Hunting with dogs is permissible, however, 
where it has been carried out in accordance with one of the exceptions 
in the Act.[25] Many prehistoric deities are depicted as predators or prey 
of humans, often in a zoomorphic form, perhaps alluding to the importance 
of hunting for most Palaeolithic cultures. In many pagan religions, specific 
rituals are conducted before or after a hunt; the rituals done may vary 
according to the species hunted or the season the hunt is taking place.[citation 
needed] Often a hunting ground, or the hunt for one or more species, was 
reserved or prohibited in the context of a temple cult.[citation needed] 
Hindu scriptures describe hunting as an acceptable occupation, as well 
as a sport of the kingly. Even figures considered godly are described to 
have engaged in hunting. One of the names of the god Shiva is Mrigavyadha, 
which translates as "the deer hunter" (mriga means deer; vyadha means hunter). 
The word Mriga, in many Indian languages including Malayalam, not only 
stands for deer, but for all animals and animal instincts (Mriga Thrishna). 
Shiva, as Mrigavyadha, is the one who destroys the animal instincts in 
human beings. In the epic Ramayana, Dasharatha, the father of Rama, is 
said to have the ability to hunt in the dark. During one of his hunting 
expeditions, he accidentally killed Shravana, mistaking him for game. During 
Rama's exile in the forest, Ravana kidnapped his wife, Sita, from their 
hut, while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer, and his brother 
Lakshman went after him. According to the Mahabharat, Pandu, the father 
of the Pandavas, accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with 
an arrow, mistaking them for a deer. Krishna is said to have died after 
being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter. Jainism teaches followers 
to have tremendous respect for all of life. Prohibitions for hunting and 
meat eating are the fundamental conditions for being a Jain. Buddhism's 
first precept is the respect for all sentient life. The general approach 
by all Buddhists is to avoid killing any living animals. Buddha explained 
the issue by saying "all fear death; comparing others with oneself, one 
should neither kill nor cause to kill." From early Christian times, hunting 
has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church clerics. Thus the Corpus Juris 
Canonici (C. ii, X, De cleric. venat.) says, "We forbid to all servants 
of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds; and we also 
forbid them to keep hawks or falcons." The Fourth Council of the Lateran, 
held under Pope Innocent III, decreed (canon xv): "We interdict hunting 
or hawking to all clerics." The decree of the Council of Trent is worded 
more mildly: "Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking" (Sess. 
XXIV, De reform., c. xii), which seems to imply that not all hunting is 
illicit, and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy (clamorosa) 
hunting unlawful, but not quiet (quieta) hunting. Ferraris (s.v. "Clericus", 
art. 6) gives it as the general sense of canonists that hunting is allowed 
to clerics if it be indulged in rarely and for sufficient cause, as necessity, 
utility or "honest" recreation, and with that moderation which is becoming 
to the ecclesiastical state. Ziegler, however (De episc., l. IV, c. xix), 
thinks that the interpretation of the canonists is not in accordance with 
the letter or spirit of the laws of the church. Nevertheless, although 
a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting is undoubtedly permissible, 
it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the 
clerics of his diocese, as was done by synods at Milan, Avignon, Li√®ge, 
Cologne, and elsewhere. Benedict XIV (De synodo di≈ìces., l. II, c. x) declared 
that such synodal decrees are not too severe, as an absolute prohibition 
of hunting is more conformable to the ecclesiastical law. In practice, 
therefore, the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted 
to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether. 
It is important to note that most Christian, do not observe kosher dietary 
laws hence most Christian have no religious restrictions on eating the 
animals hunted. This is in accord with what is found in the Acts of the 
Apostles 15:28‚Äì29, and 1 Timothy 4:4. In Jewish law hunting is not forbidden 
although there is an aversion to it. The great 18th-century authority Rabbi 
Yechezkel Landau after a study concluded although "hunting would not be 
considered cruelty to animals insofar as the animal is generally killed 
quickly and not tortured... There is an unseemly element in it, namely 
cruelty." The other issue is that hunting can be dangerous and Judaism 
places an extreme emphasis on the value of human life.[26][27] Islamic 
Sharia Law permits hunting of lawful animals and birds if they cannot be 
easily caught and slaughtered.[28] New Zealand has a strong hunting culture. 
The islands making up New Zealand originally had no land mammals apart 
from bats. However, once Europeans arrived, game animals were introduced 
by acclimatisation societies to provide New Zealanders with sport and a 
hunting resource. Deer, pigs, goats, rabbits, hare, tahr and chamois all 
adapted well to the New Zealand terrain, and with no natural predators, 
their population exploded. Government agencies view the animals as pests 
due to their effects on the natural environment and on agricultural production, 
but hunters view them as a resource. During the feudal and colonial times 
in British India, hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous 
princely states, as many maharajas and nawabs, as well as British officers, 
maintained a whole corps of shikaris (big-game hunters), who were native 
professional hunters. They would be headed by a master of the hunt, who 
might be styled mir-shikar. Often, they recruited the normally low-ranking 
local tribes because of their traditional knowledge of the environment 
and hunting techniques. Big game, such as Bengal tigers, might be hunted 
from the back of an elephant. Regional social norms are generally antagonistic 
to hunting, while a few sects, such as the Bishnoi, lay special emphasis 
on the conservation of particular species, such as the antelope. India's 
Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 bans the killing of all wild animals. However, 
the Chief Wildlife Warden may, if satisfied that any wild animal from a 
specified list has become dangerous to human life, or is so disabled or 
diseased as to be beyond recovery, permit any person to hunt such an animal. 
In this case, the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government 
property.[29] A safari, from a Swahili word meaning "a long journey", especially 
in Africa, is defined as an overland journey. Safari as a distinctive way 
of hunting was popularised by the US author Ernest Hemingway and President 
Theodore Roosevelt. A safari may consist of a several-days- or even weeks-long 
journey, with camping in the bush or jungle, while pursuing big game. Nowadays, 
it is often used to describe tours through African national parks to watch 
or hunt wildlife. Hunters are usually tourists, accompanied by licensed 
and highly regulated professional hunters, local guides, skinners, and 
porters in more difficult terrains. A special safari type is the solo-safari, 
where all the license acquiring, stalking, preparation, and outfitting 
is done by the hunter himself. Unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds 
is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom; 
in fact, "hunting" without qualification implies fox hunting. What in other 
countries is called "hunting" is called "shooting" (birds) or "stalking" 
(deer) in Britain. Originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock, 
fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes 
in Victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot 
followers alike. Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of 
hares with hounds. Pairs of Sight hounds (or long-dogs), such as greyhounds, 
may be used to pursue a hare in coursing, where the greyhounds are marked 
as to their skill in coursing the hare (but are not intended to actually 
catch it), or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles 
or harriers. Other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags 
(deer) or mink. Deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without 
hounds, using stealth. These forms of hunting have been controversial in 
the UK. Animal welfare supporters believe that hunting causes unnecessary 
suffering to foxes, horses, and hounds. Proponents argue that it is culturally 
and perhaps economically important. Using dogs to chase wild mammals was 
made illegal in February 2005 by the Hunting Act 2004; there were a number 
of exemptions (under which the activity may not be illegal) in the act 
for hunting with hounds, but no exemptions at all for hare-coursing. Game 
birds, especially pheasants, are shot with shotguns for sport in the UK; 
the British Association for Shooting and Conservation says that over a 
million people per year participate in shooting, including game shooting, 
clay pigeon shooting, and target shooting.[30] Shooting as practised in 
Britain, as opposed to traditional hunting, requires little questing for 
game‚Äîaround thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates 
every year, some having been factory farmed. Shoots can be elaborate affairs 
with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns. 
When in position, "beaters" move through the areas of cover, swinging sticks 
or flags to drive the game out. Such events are often called "drives". 
The open season for grouse in the UK begins on 12 August, the so-called 
Glorious Twelfth. The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed 
by the Game Act 1831. North American hunting pre-dates the United States 
by thousands of years and was an important part of many pre-Columbian Native 
American cultures. Native Americans retain some hunting rights and are 
exempt from some laws as part of Indian treaties and otherwise under federal 
law‚Äîexamples include eagle feather laws and exemptions in the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act. This is considered particularly important in Alaskan native 
communities. Hunting is primarily regulated by state law; additional regulations 
are imposed through United States environmental law in the case of migratory 
birds and endangered species. Regulations vary widely from state to state 
and govern the areas, time periods, techniques and methods by which specific 
game animals may be hunted. Some states make a distinction between protected 
species and unprotected species (often vermin or varmints for which there 
are no hunting regulations). Hunters of protected species require a hunting 
license in all states, for which completion of a hunting safety course 
is sometimes a prerequisite. Typically, game animals are divided into several 
categories for regulatory purposes. Typical categories, along with example 
species, are as follows:[citation needed] Hunting big game typically requires 
a "tag" for each animal harvested. Tags must be purchased in addition to 
the hunting license, and the number of tags issued to an individual is 
typically limited. In cases where there are more prospective hunters than 
the quota for that species, tags are usually assigned by lottery. Tags 
may be further restricted to a specific area, or wildlife management unit. 
Hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the Fish and Wildlife 
Service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license. Harvest of 
animals other than big game is typically restricted by a bag limit and 
a possession limit. A bag limit is the maximum number of a specific animal 
species that an individual can harvest in a single day. A possession limit 
is the maximum number of a specific animal species that can be in an individual's 
possession at any time. Gun usage in hunting is typically regulated by 
game category, area within the state, and time period. Regulations for 
big-game hunting often specify a minimum caliber or muzzle energy for firearms. 
The use of rifles is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high 
population densities or limited topographic relief. Regulations may also 
limit or ban the use of lead in ammunition because of environmental concerns. 
Specific seasons for bow hunting or muzzle-loading black-powder guns are 
often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective 
weapons. Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular 
class or culture; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans 
supported legal hunting,[31] although relatively few Americans actually 
hunt. At the beginning of the 21st century, just six percent of Americans 
hunted. Southerners in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate 
of five percent, slightly below the national average, and while hunting 
was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent, these rates 
did not surpass those of the Plains states, where twelve percent of Midwesterners 
hunted. Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average.[32] 
Overall, in the 1996‚Äì2006 period, the number of hunters over the age of 
sixteen declined by ten percent, a drop attributable to a number of factors 
including habitat loss and changes in recreation habits.[33] Regulation 
of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century. Some modern 
hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode of 
Theodore Roosevelt and the Boone and Crockett Club. Local hunting clubs 
and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the 
future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use. Some groups 
represent a specific hunting interest, such as Ducks Unlimited, Pheasants 
Forever, or the Delta Waterfowl Foundation. Many hunting groups also participate 
in lobbying the federal government and state government. Each year, nearly 
$200¬†million in hunters' federal excise taxes are distributed to state 
agencies to support wildlife management programs, the purchase of lands 
open to hunters, and hunter education and safety classes. Since 1934, the 
sale of Federal Duck Stamps, a required purchase for migratory waterfowl 
hunters over sixteen years old, has raised over $700¬†million to help purchase 
more than 5,200,000 acres (8,100¬†sq¬†mi; 21,000¬†km2) of habitat for the 
National Wildlife Refuge System lands that support waterfowl and many other 
wildlife species and are often open to hunting. States also collect money 
from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals, as designated 
by law. A key task of federal and state park rangers and game wardens is 
to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting, including species protection, 
hunting seasons, and hunting bans. Varmint hunting is an American phrase 
for the selective killing of non-game animals seen as pests. While not 
always an efficient form of pest control, varmint hunting achieves selective 
control of pests while providing recreation and is much less regulated. 
Varmint species are often responsible for detrimental effects on crops, 
livestock, landscaping, infrastructure, and pets. Some animals, such as 
wild rabbits or squirrels, may be utilised for fur or meat, but often no 
use is made of the carcass. Which species are varmints depends on the circumstance 
and area. Common varmints may include various rodents, coyotes, crows, 
foxes, feral cats, and feral hogs. Some animals once considered varmints 
are now protected, such as wolves. In the US state of Louisiana, a non-native 
rodent known as a nutria has become so destructive to the local ecosystem 
that the state has initiated a bounty program to help control the population. 
The principles of the fair chase[34] have been a part of the American hunting 
tradition for over one hundred years. The role of the hunter-conservationist, 
popularised by Theodore Roosevelt, and perpetuated by Roosevelt's formation 
of the Boone and Crockett Club, has been central to the development of 
the modern fair chase tradition. Beyond Fair Chase: The Ethic and Tradition 
of Hunting, a book by Jim Posewitz, describes fair chase: "Fundamental 
to ethical hunting is the idea of fair chase. This concept addresses the 
balance between the hunter and the hunted. It is a balance that allows 
hunters to occasionally succeed while animals generally avoid being taken."[35] 
When Internet hunting was introduced in 2005, allowing people to hunt over 
the Internet using remotely controlled guns, the practice was widely criticised 
by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase. As a representative 
of the National Rifle Association (NRA) explained, "The NRA has always 
maintained that fair chase, being in the field with your firearm or bow, 
is an important element of hunting tradition. Sitting at your desk in front 
of your computer, clicking at a mouse, has nothing to do with hunting."[36] 
One hunting club declares that a fair chase shall not involve the taking 
of animals under the following conditions: Indian blackbuck, nilgai, axis 
deer, fallow deer, and barasingha can now be found on hunting ranches in 
Texas, where they were introduced for sport hunting. Hunters can pay upwards 
of $4000 as fees for hunting a barasingha. The Russian imperial hunts evolved 
from hunting traditions of early Russian rulers‚ÄîGrand Princes and Tsars‚Äîunder 
the influence of hunting customs of European royal courts. The imperial 
hunts were organised mainly in Peterhof, Tsarskoye Selo, and Gatchina. 
Hunting in Australia has evolved around the hunting and eradication of 
various animals considered to be pests. All native animals are protected 
by law, and can only be killed under special permit. Hunted introduced 
species include deer, pigs, goats, foxes, and rabbits. The numbers of licensed 
hunters in Japan, including those using snares and guns, is generally decreasing, 
while their average age is increasing. As of 2010, there were approximately 
190,000 registered hunters, approximately 65% of whom were sixty years 
old or older.[38] There is a very active tradition of hunting of small 
to medium-sized wild game in Trinidad and Tobago. Hunting is carried out 
with firearms, and aided by the use of hounds, with the illegal use of 
trap guns, trap cages and snare nets. With approximately 12,000 sport hunters 
applying for hunting licences in recent years (in a very small country 
of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers 
and 1.3 million inhabitants), there is some concern that the practice might 
not be sustainable. In addition there are at present no bag limits and 
the open season is comparatively very long (5 months - October to February 
inclusive). As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high. Added 
to that, there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached 
wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) 
and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed 
to be fairly high. As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian 
game species (red-rumped agouti, lowland paca, nine-banded armadillo, collared 
peccary, and red brocket deer) are thought to be quite low (although scientifically 
conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted as 
of 2013). It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated 
on Tobago as a result of over-hunting. Various herons, ducks, doves, the 
green iguana, the gold tegu, the spectacled caiman and the common opossum 
are also commonly hunted and poached. There is also some poaching of 'fully 
protected species', including red howler monkeys and capuchin monkeys, 
southern tamanduas, Brazilian porcupines, yellow-footed tortoises, Trinidad 
piping guans and even one of the national birds, the scarlet ibis. Legal 
hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official 
basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training. There is presumed 
to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country (with most 
hunting for either sport or commercial profit). The local wildlife management 
authority is under-staffed and under-funded, and as such very little in 
the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws, 
with hunting occurring both in and out of season, and even in wildlife 
sanctuaries. There is some indication that the government is beginning 
to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously, with well drafted 
legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015. It remains to be seen 
if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported 
by the current and future governments, and if the general populace will 
move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation 
and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management. 
Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool[39][40] 
in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their 
habitat and threaten the well-being of other species, or, in some instances, 
damage human health or safety.[citation needed][41] However, in most circumstances 
carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability, 
and hunting for 'population control' has no effect on the annual population 
of species.[citation needed] In some cases, it can increase the population 
of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would 
otherwise be established, resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into 
an area, thus artificially increasing the population. Hunting advocates[who?] 
assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter, 
reducing mortality among the remaining animals. Some environmentalists 
assert[who?] that (re)introducing predators would achieve the same end 
with greater efficiency and less negative effect, such as introducing significant 
amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain. In the United 
States, wildlife managers are frequently part of hunting regulatory and 
licensing bodies, where they help to set rules on the number, manner and 
conditions in which game may be hunted. Management agencies sometimes rely 
on hunting to control specific animal populations, as has been the case 
with deer in North America. These hunts may sometimes be carried out by 
professional shooters, although others may include amateur hunters. Many 
US city and local governments hire professional and amateur hunters each 
year to reduce populations of animals such as deer that are becoming hazardous 
in a restricted area, such as neighbourhood parks and metropolitan open 
spaces. A large part of managing populations involves managing the number 
and, sometimes, the size or age of animals harvested so as to ensure the 
sustainability of the population. Tools that are frequently used to control 
harvest are bag limits and season closures, although gear restrictions 
such as archery-only seasons are becoming increasingly popular in an effort 
to reduce hunter success rates.[citation needed] Bag limits are provisions 
under the law that control how many animals of a given species or group 
of species can be killed, although there are often species for which bag 
limits do not apply. There are also jurisdictions where bag limits are 
not applied at all or are not applied under certain circumstances. The 
phrase bag limits comes from the custom among hunters of small game to 
carry successful kills in a small basket, similar to a fishing creel. Where 
bag limits are used, there can be daily or seasonal bag limits; for example, 
ducks can often be harvested at a rate of six per hunter per day.[42] Big 
game, like moose, most often have a seasonal bag limit of one animal per 
hunter.[citation needed] Bag limits may also regulate the size, sex, or 
age of animal that a hunter can kill. In many cases, bag limits are designed 
to allocate harvest among the hunting population more equitably rather 
than to protect animal populations. A closed season is a time during which 
hunting an animal of a given species is contrary to law. Typically, closed 
seasons are designed to protect a species when they are most vulnerable 
or to protect them during their breeding season.[43] By extension, the 
period that is not the closed season is known as the open season. Illegal 
hunting and harvesting of wild species contrary to local and international 
conservation and wildlife management laws is called poaching. Game preservation 
is one of the tactics used to prevent poaching. Violations of hunting laws 
and regulations involving poaching are normally punishable by law.[44] 
Punishment can include confiscation of equipment, fines and/or a prison 
sentence. In Costa Rica, all forms of sport hunting have been illegal since 
10 December 2012.[45] Historical, subsistence, and sport hunting techniques 
can differ radically, with modern hunting regulations often addressing 
issues of where, when, and how hunts are conducted. Techniques may vary 
depending on government regulations, a hunter's personal ethics, local 
custom, hunting equipment, and the animal being hunted. Often a hunter 
will use a combination of more than one technique. Laws may forbid sport 
hunters from using some methods used primarily in poaching and wildlife 
management. Trophy hunting is the selective seeking of wild game. It may 
also include the controversial hunting of captive or semi-captive animals 
expressly bred and raised under controlled or semi-controlled conditions 
so as to attain trophy characteristics; this is sometimes known as canned 
hunts.[50] In the 19th century, southern and central European sport hunters 
often pursued game only for a trophy, usually the head or pelt of an animal, 
which was then displayed as a sign of prowess. The rest of the animal was 
typically discarded. Some cultures, however, disapprove of such waste. 
In Nordic countries, hunting for trophies was‚Äîand still is‚Äîfrowned upon. 
Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way 
to supplement food supplies, although it is now undertaken mainly for sport.[citation 
needed] The safari method of hunting was a development of sport hunting 
that saw elaborate travel in Africa, India and other places in pursuit 
of trophies. In modern times, trophy hunting persists and is a significant 
industry in some areas.[citation needed] According to the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, hunting "provides an economic incentive" for ranchers 
to continue to breed those species, and that hunting "reduces the threat 
of the species' extinction."[51][52] A scientific study in the journal, 
Biological Conservation, states that trophy hunting is of "major importance 
to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation 
over vast areas, including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative 
wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism."[53] However, 
another study states that less than 3% of a trophy hunters' expenditures 
reach the local level, meaning that the economic incentive and benefit 
is "minimal, particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that 
hunting concessions occupy."[54] Financial incentives from trophy hunting 
effectively more than double the land area that is used for wildlife conservation, 
relative to what would be conserved relying on national parks alone according 
to Biological Conservation,[53] although local communities usually derive 
no more than 18 cents per hectare from trophy hunting.[54] Trophy hunting 
has been considered essential for providing economic incentives to conserve 
large carnivores according to research studies in Conservation Biology,[55] 
Journal of Sustainable Tourism,[56] Wildlife Conservation by Sustainable 
Use,[57] and Animal Conservation.[55][58] Studies by the Centre for Responsible 
Tourism[59] and the IUCN state that ecotourism, which includes more than 
hunting, is a superior economic incentive, generating twice the revenue 
per acre and 39 times more permanent employment.[60] Trophy hunting is 
most often criticised when it involves rare or endangered animals.[61] 
Opponents may also see trophy hunting as an issue of morality[62] or animal 
cruelty, criticising the killing of living creatures for recreation. Victorian 
era dramatist W. S. Gilbert remarked, "Deer-stalking would be a very fine 
sport if only the deer had guns."[63] There is also debate about the extent 
to which trophy hunting benefits the local economy. Hunters argue that 
fees paid contribute to the local economy and provide value to animals 
that would otherwise be seen as competition for grazing, livestock, and 
crops.[64] This analysis is disputed by opponents of trophy hunting.[65] 
Some[who?] argue that the animals are worth more to the community for ecotourism 
than hunting.[66] A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support 
hunting on economic grounds. In Tanzania, it is estimated that a safari 
hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average ecotourist. 
While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation, the average 
safari hunter generally stays in tented camps. Safari hunters are also 
more likely to use remote areas, uninviting to the typical ecotourist. 
Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and 
revenue for local communities.[citation needed] In the United Kingdom, 
the game hunting of birds as an industry is said to be extremely important 
to the rural economy. The Cobham Report of 1997 suggested it to be worth 
around ¬£700¬†million, and hunting and shooting lobby groups claimed it to 
be worth over a billion pounds less than ten years later.[citation needed] 
Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States, with 
many companies specialising in hunting equipment or speciality tourism. 
Many different technologies have been created to assist hunters, even including 
iPhone applications.[67] Today's hunters come from a broad range of economic, 
social, and cultural backgrounds. In 2001, over thirteen million hunters 
averaged eighteen days hunting, and spent over $20.5¬†billion on their sport.[citation 
needed] In the US, proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game 
management programs, including preservation of wildlife habitat. Lead bullets 
that miss their target or remain in an unretrieved carcass become a persistent 
toxicant in the environment. Waterfowl or other birds may ingest the lead 
and poison themselves with the neurotoxicant. Since 1991, US federal law 
forbids lead shot in waterfowl hunts, and 30 states have some type of restriction.[68] 
In December 2014, a federal appeals court denied a lawsuit by environmental 
groups that the EPA must use the Toxic Substances Control Act to regulate 
lead in shells and cartridges. The groups sought EPA to regulate "spent 
lead", yet the court found EPA could not regulate spent lead without also 
regulating cartridges and shells.[69] Hunters have been driving forces 
throughout history in the movement to ensure the preservation of wildlife 
habitats and wildlife for further hunting.[70] However, excessive hunting 
and poachers have also contributed heavily to the endangerment, extirpation 
and extinction of many animals, such as the quagga, the great auk, Steller's 
sea cow, the thylacine, the bluebuck, the Arabian oryx, the Caspian and 
Javan tigers, the markhor, the Sumatran rhinoceros, the bison, the North 
American cougar, the Altai argali sheep, the Asian elephant and many more, 
primarily for commercial sale or sport. All these animals have been hunted 
to endangerment or extinction.[3][71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78][79][80][81] 
In 1937, American hunters successfully lobbied the US Congress to pass 
the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act, which placed an eleven 
percent tax on all hunting equipment. This self-imposed tax now generates 
over $700¬†million each year and is used exclusively to establish, restore 
and protect wildlife habitats.[82] The act is named for Nevada Senator 
Key Pittman and Virginia Congressman Absalom Willis Robertson. On 16 March 
1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Migratory Bird Hunting 
Stamp Act, which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over 
the age of sixteen. The stamps are created on behalf of the program by 
the US Postal Service and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual 
contest. They play an important role in habitat conservation because ninety-eight 
percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase 
or lease of wetland habitat for protection in the National Wildlife Refuge 
System.[citation needed] In addition to waterfowl, it is estimated that 
one third of the nation's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas 
protected using Duck Stamp funds.[citation needed] Since 1934, the sale 
of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $670¬†million, and helped to purchase 
or lease 5,200,000 acres (8,100¬†sq¬†mi; 21,000¬†km2) of habitat. The stamps 
serve as a license to hunt migratory birds, an entrance pass for all National 
Wildlife Refuge areas, and are also considered collectors items often purchased 
for aesthetic reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities. Although 
non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps, eighty-seven percent 
of their sales are contributed by hunters, which is logical, as hunters 
are required to purchase them. Distribution of funds is managed by the 
Migratory Bird Conservation Commission (MBCC).[83] The Arabian oryx, a 
species of large antelope, once inhabited much of the desert areas of the 
Middle East.[76] However, the species' striking appearance made it (along 
with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax) a popular quarry 
for sport hunters, especially foreign executives of oil companies working 
in the region.[citation needed] The use of automobiles and high-powered 
rifles destroyed their only advantage: speed, and they became extinct in 
the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972. The scimitar-horned 
oryx followed suit, while the addax became critically endangered.[84] However, 
the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from "extinct 
in the wild" to "vulnerable" due to conservation efforts like captive breeding[85] 
The markhor is an endangered species of wild goat which inhabits the mountains 
of Central Asia and Pakistan. The colonization of these regions by Britain 
gave British sport hunters access to the species, and they were hunted 
heavily, almost to the point of extinction. Only their willingness to breed 
in captivity and the inhospitability of their mountainous habitat prevented 
this. Despite these factors, the markhor is still endangered.[86] The American 
bison is a large bovid which inhabited much of western North America prior 
to the 1800s, living on the prairies in large herds. However, the vast 
herds of bison attracted market hunters, who killed dozens of bison for 
their hides only, leaving the rest to rot. Thousands of these hunters quickly 
eliminated the bison herds, bringing the population from several million 
in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s. Conservation efforts 
have allowed the population to increase, but the bison remains near-threatened.[87] 
The Journal of International Wildlife Law and Policy cites that the legalization 
of white rhinoceros hunting in South Africa motivated private landowners 
to reintroduce the species onto their lands. As a result, the country saw 
an increase in white rhinos from fewer than one hundred individuals to 
more than 11,000, even while a limited number were killed as trophies.[88] 
However, the illegal hunting of rhinoceros for their horns is highly damaging 
to the population and is currently growing globally,[89] with 1004 being 
killed in South Africa alone according to the most recent estimate.[90] 
According to Richard Conniff, Namibia is home to 1,750 of the roughly 5,000 
black rhinos surviving in the wild because it allows trophy hunting of 
various species. Namibia's mountain zebra population has increased to 27,000 
from 1,000 in 1982. Elephants, which "are gunned down elsewhere for their 
ivory", have gone to 20,000 from 15,000 in 1995. Lions, which were on the 
brink of extinction "from Senegal to Kenya", are increasing in Namibia.[91] 
In contrast, Botswana has recently been forced to ban trophy hunting following 
a precipitous wildlife decline.[92] The numbers of antelope plummeted across 
Botswana, with a resultant decline in predator numbers, while elephant 
numbers remained stable and hippopotamus numbers rose. According to the 
government of Botswana, trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for 
this, but many other factors, such as poaching, drought and habitat loss 
are also to blame.[93] Uganda recently did the same, arguing that "the 
share of benefits of sport hunting were lopsided and unlikely to deter 
poaching or improve [Uganda's] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves."[94] 
A study issued by the Wildlife Society concluded that hunting and trapping 
are cost effective tools that reduce wildlife damage by reducing a population 
below the capacity of the environment to carry it and changing the behaviors 
of animals to stop them from causing damage. The study furthermore states 
that the cessation of hunting could cause wildlife to be severely harmed, 
rural property values to fall, and the incentive of landowners to maintain
