William Walsingham, Jr. (Ca. 1909 â€“ April 13, 1969) was an American front 
office executive in Major League Baseball. He spent the bulk of his 30-year 
career with the St. Louis Cardinals, owned by his uncle, Sam Breadon, from 
1920 through 1947. Walsingham began as a ticket-taker with the Cardinals, 
but by the early 1940s he had become a vice president of the Redbirds. 
When Breadon parted company with his longtime general manager, Hall of 
Famer Branch Rickey, at the close of the 1942 campaign, Walsingham became 
the club's chief of baseball operations, although the GM title was not 
formally assigned to him. He was part of a management triumvirate that 
included Breadon and the Cardinals' chief scout, Joe Mathes. Walsingham 
continued as a vice president of the Cards, GM without portfolio, and a 
member of its board of directors, after Breadon sold the club to Robert 
E. Hannegan and Fred Saigh in 1947. In January 1953, Saigh was forced to 
dispose of the Cardinals after his conviction on income tax charges. Walsingham 
stepped in as the team's official National League representative and chief 
executive, as rumors swirled that he would assemble a syndicate to buy 
the franchise. However, August "Gussie" Busch came forward as the team's 
new owner; the "beer baron" would operate the Cardinals for the next 36 
years. Walsingham eventually left the Cardinals to become an executive 
vice president with the Baltimore Orioles (ironically, the transplanted 
St. Louis Browns, who battled the Cardinals unsuccessfully for the affections 
of St. Louis fans through 1953) during the 1957 and 1958 seasons. By the 
end of the 1950s, however, he returned to St. Louis to become an executive 
with Gussie Busch's Anheuser-Busch brewery. Walsingham died in St. Louis
