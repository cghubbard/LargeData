Frederick Alfred "Rick" Porcello III (born December 27, 1988), is an American 
professional baseball pitcher for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He previously played for the Detroit Tigers. Porcello was drafted 
27th overall in the first round of the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft 
by the Tigers.[1] His choice of sports agent Scott Boras to advise him 
may have scared away some teams, knocking him down to the 27th spot even 
though he was ranked No. 1 among high school prospects entering the draft.[2] 
Porcello had been described as an "ace" who could be a "bona fide No. 1 
starter."[3] He was also known as a "special" pitcher. His manager, Jim 
Leyland, later chose to start him in the 2009 American League Central tie-breaker 
game over Nate Robertson, Eddie Bonine, and Armando Galarraga. In 2009, 
he was the youngest player in the American League.[4] Porcello graduated 
from Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, New Jersey in 2007. 
In his senior season, he compiled a 10–0 record with 103 strikeouts and 
a 1.44 ERA in 63 innings pitched.[2] He threw a perfect game on May 12, 
2007 against Newark Academy. Porcello had only given up multiple hits once 
in a game to one player (Jon Serrano) in his high school career (in the 
2nd round Greater Newark Tournament[citation needed] during the Seton Hall 
Prep vs Belleville game). Although Porcello signed a letter of intent to 
attend the University of North Carolina, he later declined in order to 
pursue his professional career in Major League Baseball. Porcello was signed 
by the Detroit Tigers to a $7.28 million,[5] four-year deal with two one-year 
options. The total contract is worth $11.1 million, making Porcello the 
highest-paid high schooler ever.[6] He also received a $3.5 million signing 
bonus, the second-largest ever given out by the Tigers, surpassed only 
by the $3.55 million[7] given to 2006 first round pick Andrew Miller. Porcello 
played the entire 2008 season with the Lakeland Flying Tigers, Detroit's 
advanced class-A affiliate. He earned his first victory against the Tampa 
Yankees on April 3, 2008. On May 12, he was named the Florida State League 
Pitcher of the Week.[8] On July 19, he took part in a seven inning combined 
no-hitter against the St. Lucie Mets.[9] Porcello finished the season with 
a record of 8–6 in 125 innings pitched. His 2.66 ERA was the lowest in 
the FSL.[10] On February 7, 2009, Tigers general manager Dave Dombrowski 
stated that Porcello would be considered for the final spot in the Tigers 
rotation, pending his spring training performance.[11] Porcello began drawing 
comparisons to Boston Red Sox ace Josh Beckett, namely from Tigers official 
Al Avila, who was the Florida Marlins scouting director when the team drafted 
Beckett in 1999.[12] On April 1, Dombrowski confirmed that Porcello would 
make the 2009 opening day roster after posting a 2.63 ERA in five Grapefruit 
League games. Dombrowski stated: On April 9, Porcello made his Major League 
debut against Toronto, opposite Blue Jays rookie pitcher Ricky Romero. 
The game marked the first time in MLB history that two first-round picks 
faced each other in their respective debuts.[14] Porcello pitched five 
innings and took the loss for Detroit. He struck out four batters and allowed 
four runs on eight hits.[15] On April 19, Porcello earned his first career 
win in an 8–2 victory over the Seattle Mariners. He allowed one run and 
struck out three in seven innings with no walks. He retired the final 14 
batters he faced.[16] Porcello won all five games he started in May. He 
became the youngest pitcher to win five starts in a row since Dwight Gooden 
won seven in a row in 1985, as well as the first Tiger age 20 or younger 
to win five consecutive starts since at least 1954 (research prior to that 
year is incomplete).[17] On August 11, during a game against the Boston 
Red Sox, Porcello hit Kevin Youkilis with a pitch. Youkilis charged the 
mound and threw his helmet right in front of Porcello. Porcello tackled 
Youkilis, both went down, and both benches cleared. Both players were ejected 
for the brawl and were each sentenced to a five-game suspension. Despite 
his youth, Porcello was selected by Tiger manager Jim Leyland to pitch 
in the one-game tie-breaker playoff for the AL Central Division crown after 
the Tigers and Minnesota Twins both finished the regular season at 86–76. 
Porcello allowed two runs (one earned) in 5 2⁄3 innings of work, getting 
a no-decision in the game that the Twins eventually won in 12 innings.[18] 
Porcello finished the 2009 season with a 14–9 record and 3.96 ERA. On November 
16, it was announced that Porcello finished third in the voting for American 
League Rookie of the Year, behind Andrew Bailey of the Oakland Athletics 
and Elvis Andrus of the Texas Rangers.[19] Porcello began the 2010 season 
with a 4–7 record, accumulating a 6.14 ERA. On June 20, 2010 he was sent 
down to AAA Toledo.[20] He was called back up on July 17 to face the Indians.[21] 
In his first start back with the team, he had quite possibly the best start 
of his career to date, continuing the trend of struggling starters in the 
Tiger rotation finding success after stints with the Mud Hens. He went 
eight innings against the Indians, allowing one run, striking out six and 
walking none.[22] Porcello finished the 2010 season with a 10–12 record, 
going 5–1 in his last 7 starts and bringing his season ERA down to 4.92. 
Porcello entered Spring Training competing for a job in the Tigers starting 
rotation, battling with teammates Phil Coke, Jacob Turner, and Brad Penny 
for a spot. He ended up in the Tigers rotation for the 2011 season. He 
started in 31 games for the Tigers, pitching 182 innings (his career high 
for a season, through 2013) and accumulating a 14-9 record, 104 strikeouts 
and a 4.75 ERA. In the 2011 postseason, Porcello made four appearances 
(two starts), compiling an 0–1 record with a 4.80 ERA and 12 strikeouts 
in 15 innings. On January 6, 2012, Porcello opted out of an option for 
2012 included in his four-year contract, becoming arbitration eligible 
and under team control through 2015.[23] After gaining Super Two status 
by reaching the required amount of service time, Porcello gained an extra 
year of arbitration eligibility, which was 2012. On January 16, Porcello 
agreed to a one-year, $3.1 million deal with the Tigers, avoiding arbitration. 
Because he filed for arbitration and did not accept his option for 2012, 
he earned an extra $1.76 million.[24] Porcello made 31 starts in 2012, 
going 10–12 with a 4.59 ERA. He struck out a career-high 107 batters on 
the season, but also surrendered a career-high 226 hits. Porcello was on 
the postseason roster for the Tigers, who went all the way to the World 
Series, but he pitched only 1 1⁄3 postseason innings, allowing no runs. 
On January 18, 2013, Porcello signed a one-year, $5.1 million contract 
with the Tigers to avoid arbitration for a second time.[25] With the Tigers 
signing fourth starter Aníbal Sánchez to a five-year deal, Porcello competed 
with Drew Smyly for the fifth and final spot in the Tigers rotation. On 
March 26, it was announced that Porcello had won the No. 5 starter job 
over Smyly.[26] In his Tigers career through 2012, Porcello wore uniform 
number 48. When the Tigers acquired outfielder Torii Hunter – who also 
wears number 48 – in the 2012–13 offseason, Hunter made a monetary offer 
for the number. Porcello, a New Jersey native, instead asked Hunter to 
donate the money he offered to victims of Hurricane Sandy, and Porcello 
changed to number 21 for the 2013 season. In a May 28 game against the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, Porcello pitched eight shutout innings and fanned 11 
batters to establish a new career high for strikeouts in a game.[27] On 
June 30, Porcello threw a pitch that hit Ben Zobrist of the Tampa Bay Rays. 
It was widely thought that the pitch was in retaliation for a pitch that 
Rays reliever Fernando Rodney threw near the head of Tigers superstar Miguel 
Cabrera the night before. The benches were warned and there were no incidents 
the remainder of the game, but two days later, MLB suspended Porcello six 
games and fined him an undisclosed amount. On September 10, Porcello pitched 
his first career complete game in his 147th major league start, resulting 
in a 9–1 win over the Chicago White Sox. Porcello retired 14 consecutive 
batters after escaping a fourth-inning jam that yielded his only run allowed.[28] 
Porcello finished the regular season with a 13–8 record, 4.32 ERA, and 
a career-high 142 strikeouts. On January 17, 2014, Porcello and the Tigers 
avoided arbitration for the third straight season by agreeing to a one-year 
deal worth $8.5 million.[29] On June 26, Porcello pitched his first career 
complete game shutout in a 6–0 win over the Texas Rangers. He gave up just 
three hits in the game, striking out six and throwing 115 pitches.[30] 
In his next start on July 1, Porcello pitched a complete game shutout in 
a 3–0 win over the Oakland Athletics, giving up four hits, striking out 
zero, walking no one, and throwing 95 pitches. Porcello became the first 
Tiger to pitch back-to-back shutouts since Jack Morris in 1986. He became 
the first Major League pitcher to throw a shutout without a walk or a strikeout 
since Jeff Ballard on August 21, 1989.[31] On a more recent distinction, 
he was also the first Major League pitcher to throw a no-strikeout shutout 
since Derek Lowe did for the Indians on May 15, 2012.[32] On August 20, 
Porcello pitched his third complete game shutout of the season in a 6–0 
win over the Tampa Bay Rays, giving up three hits, striking out four and 
walking none. Porcello is the first Tiger pitcher to throw at least three 
shutouts in a season since Jeff Weaver in 2002. Porcello's three shutouts 
tied him with Henderson Álvarez for the major league lead.[33] On August 
26, Rick defeated the New York Yankees 5–2 for his 15th victory of the 
season, establishing a new career high in wins. He had won 14 games in 
two prior seasons (2009, 2011).[34] Rick struggled down the stretch, however, 
going 0–4 with a 6.20 ERA in September.[35] He would finish the 2014 regular 
season with a 15–13 record, 129 strikeouts, and a career-best 3.43 ERA. 
He topped 200 innings pitched for the first time in his career, with 204 2⁄3. 
On December 11, 2014, the Tigers traded Porcello to the Boston Red Sox 
in exchange for Yoenis Céspedes, Alex Wilson, and Gabe Speier.[36] On April 
6, 2015, Porcello and the Red Sox agreed on a 4-year contract extension 
worth $82.5 million, including a $500,000 signing bonus.[37][38] On August 
2, 2015, Porcello was placed on the Disabled List (retroactive to July 
30) for the first time in his career, with the Red Sox stating he was suffering 
from triceps soreness and inflammation. At the time, Rick was mired in 
his worst season, statistically, having posted a 5–11 record and a 5.81 
ERA prior to the injury.[39] He returned August 26 and threw seven shutout 
innings in a 3–0 win over the Chicago White Sox.[40] In his next start, 
September 1 against the New York Yankees, Porcello struck out a career-high 
13 batters in 8 innings, but lost a 3-1 decision.[41] Porcello finished 
his first season in Boston with a 9–15 record in 28 starts, and an ERA 
of 4.92 which tied his career high. He gave up a career-high 25 home runs, 
but also had a career-high strikeout rate (7.8 K/9). On September 9, 2016, 
Porcello became the first Major League pitcher to reach 20 wins in the 
current season, as the Red Sox defeated the Toronto Blue Jays, 13–3.[42] 
Porcello led the major leagues in 2016 with 22 wins (against four losses) 
and posted career bests in most major statistical categories, including: 
innings pitched (223), strikeouts (189), ERA (3.15) and WHIP (1.01). He 
also allowed 32 walks over the entire season, leading the major leagues 
with a 5.91 strikeout-to-walk ratio. Porcello's 26 quality starts were 
tied for the AL lead (with former teammate Justin Verlander).[43] On November 
7, Porcello was announced by the BBWAA as a finalist for the 2016 American 
League Cy Young Award, along with Justin Verlander and Corey Kluber.[44] 
On November 9, Porcello was named the American League's Outstanding Pitcher, 
given by the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). Porcello, 
a resident of Chester Township, New Jersey, was inducted into the Spanish 
National Honor Society at Seton Hall Prep.[citation needed] He graduated 
with a four-year weighted cumulative GPA of 3.94.[45] His older brother 
Zach is a pitching coach at Seton Hall University. His younger brother 
Jake is a 2009 graduate of Seton Hall Prep and is currently a pitcher at 
Seton Hall University and was drafted by the Tigers in the 48th round of 
the 2009 draft.[46] He received pitching training from the former Morristown 
Beard School Baseball pitching coach, Mike Sturgeon. Porcello is the maternal 
grandson of Sam Dente, who played for the Cleveland Indians in the 1954 
World Series.[47] Porcello is a groundball pitcher who relies on a sinking 
two-seam fastball. He throws his two-seamer about half the time, ranging 
from 91–93 mph. He also has a four-seam fastball in the 91–93 range (tops 
out at 94–95 mph) and a circle changeup in the low 80s which is used mostly 
on left-handed hitters. He used to throw an occasional slider, but scrapped 
it prior to the 2013 season for a more effective upper-70s curveball.[48][49] 
Porcello's fomer pitching coach Jeff Jones for the Tigers describes the 
curve as a "change of pace, something that he can throw as a first pitch 
to a left-handed hitter for a strike."[50] Porcello's groundball rate in 
2013 was 55.3%, the highest of his career and one of the best in the majors,
