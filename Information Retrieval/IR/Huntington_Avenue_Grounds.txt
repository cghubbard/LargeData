Huntington Avenue American League Base Ball Grounds is the full name of 
the baseball stadium that formerly stood in Boston, Massachusetts, and 
was the first home field for the Boston Red Sox (known informally as the 
'Boston Americans' until 1908) from 1901–1911. The stadium, built for $35,000, 
was located across the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad tracks 
from the South End Grounds, home of the Boston Braves. The stadium was 
the site of the first World Series game between the modern American and 
National leagues in 1903, and also saw the first perfect game in the modern 
era, thrown by Cy Young on May 5, 1904. The playing field was built on 
a former circus lot and was fairly large by modern standards-530 feet to 
center field, later expanded to 635 feet in 1908. It had many quirks not 
seen in modern baseball stadiums, including patches of sand in the outfield 
where grass would not grow, and a tool shed in deep center field that was 
actually in play. The Huntington Avenue Grounds was demolished after the 
Red Sox left at the beginning of the 1912 season to play at Fenway Park. 
The Cabot Center, an indoor athletic venue belonging to Northeastern University, 
now stands on Huntington Grounds footprint. A plaque and a statue of Cy 
Young was erected in 1993 where the pitchers mound used to be, commemorating 
the history of this ballpark in what is now called World Series Way. Meanwhile, 
a plaque on the side of the Cabot Center (1956) marks the former location 
of the left field foul pole. The Cabot facility itself is barely over a 
¼-mile away to the southwest from another, still-standing Boston area sports 
facility of that era, Matthews Arena (built in 1910), the original home
