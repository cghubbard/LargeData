The 2003 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 121st season in the history 
of the franchise. The Phillies finished in third-place in the National 
League East, 15 games behind the Atlanta Braves, and five games behind 
the 2003 World Series champion Florida Marlins, who were the NL's wild-card 
winner. The Phillies were managed by their former shortstop Larry Bowa, 
as they played their final season of home games at Veterans Stadium, before 
moving the club to Citizens Bank Park in 2004. The Phillies missed the 
playoffs for the ninth straight season, tying a record set between 1984-92
