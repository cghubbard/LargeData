John Andrew Beazley (May 25, 1918 â€“ April 21, 1990) was a right-handed 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the St. Louis Cardinals 
and Boston Braves. As a rookie in 1942, Beazley went 21-6 with a 2.13 ERA 
for the Cardinals, as his 21 wins and ERA ranked him second in the National 
League behind teammate Mort Cooper (22 and 1.78). Beazley completed his 
feat pitching two complete-game wins in the team's World Series victory 
over the New York Yankees in five games, allowing three runs in Game Two 
and two runs in Game Five for a combined 2.50 ERA. After the season, Beazley 
enlisted in the U.S. Air Force during World War II. While serving, he was 
sent to pitch for an Army team and felt pain in his arm, but ordered by 
his commanding officer to pitch through the pain, Beazley severely hurt 
his arm. Coming out of the service in 1946, he tried in vain to regain 
his form but was never the same, winning only nine games for the rest of 
his career. In a six-season career, Beazley posted a 31-12 record with 
147 strikeouts and a 3.01 ERA in 76 games, including three shutouts and 
21 complete games in 374 innings pitched. After leaving baseball, Beazley 
worked as a beer distributor. He died of cancer in Nashville at age 71.
