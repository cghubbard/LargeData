The 2016 Detroit Tigers season was the team's 116th season. The Tigers 
opened the season on the road against the Miami Marlins on April 5, and 
their home opener was on April 8 against the New York Yankees.[2] The Tigers 
finished the season in second place in the American League Central division, 
with an 86–75 record. They had a chance for a Wild Card berth until the 
final day of the regular season, but their 1–0 loss to the Atlanta Braves 
and wins by the Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays kept the team out 
of the playoffs for the second consecutive season. Infielders Outfielders
