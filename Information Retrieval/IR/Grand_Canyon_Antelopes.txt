The Grand Canyon Antelopes are the 21 athletic teams representing Grand 
Canyon University in Phoenix, Arizona, more commonly referred to as the 
Lopes. Most of the university's athletic teams compete at the NCAA Division 
I level in the Western Athletic Conference. Men's volleyball competes in 
the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (MIVA). GCU was a 
member of the NAIA until the early 1990s when it transferred to NCAA Division 
II, in which it competed until 2013. The university has undergone a transition 
from a small struggling non-profit liberal arts college to a large modern 
for-profit private university. Along with the general campus upgrades has 
come an increase in athletics and athletic facilities. On November 27, 
2012, Grand Canyon University announced that it had accepted an invitation 
to join Division I's Western Athletic Conference, effective July 1, 2013.[2] 
This move made Grand Canyon the only for-profit institution with a Division 
I athletic program.[3] GCU's business model was at the center of an emerging 
controversy in college sports. In July 2013, the chief executives of all 
12 members of the Pac-12 Conference sent a joint letter to the NCAA asking 
that the organization review whether for-profit institutions have a place 
in Division I sports.[4] Within days, GCU CEO Brian Mueller accused Arizona 
State University president Michael Crow of being behind this move.[5] The 
GCU / Pac-12 altercation appeared to die down with time, as the Lopes have 
played Pac-12 opponents or have them on the future schedule. Grand Canyon 
played the Washington Huskies in softball in 2015[6] and is scheduled to 
play the USC Trojans in women's basketball in 2015[7] and the Oregon State 
Beavers in baseball in 2016.[8] The university announced a five-year sponsorship 
deal with Nike on May 27, 2015 as a part of Grand Canyon's athletic expansion.

that it would discontinue the wrestling program.[20] NCAA men's lacrosse 
made a brief appearance as an official school sport at GCU from 2008-2011. 
The team began in 2008 and played the first lacrosse game in school history 
on February 10, 2008, an 8-18 loss to the University of Arizona (MCLA DI).[21] 
In 2010 GCU and the few other NCAA DII lacrosse programs in the Southwest 
formed the Western Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association In the Lopes only 
season as a member of the WILA, the team recorded a 3-5 conference record.[22]

due to lack of NCAA Division II competition in the university announced 
in March 2011 it would end Division II lacrosse competition.[23] Shortly 
after the university announced the program will compete at the varsity-club
