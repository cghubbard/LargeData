Joshua M. Devore (November 13, 1887 – October 6, 1954), was a professional 
baseball player who played outfielder in the major leagues from 1908–1914. 
He would play for the Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies, New York 
Giants, and Boston Braves. Devore resided in Seelyville, a small community 
in Vigo County, Indiana during his early pro baseball career, getting his 
start in what was known as the Trolley League in Terre Haute, Indiana. 
Due to his quickness, Josh was known as "The Seelyville Speed Demon." In 
his prime, Devore was an expert bunter and baserunner who was adept at 
drawing walks, and he was an effective leadoff man for the Giants' pennant-winners 
of 1911 and 1912. In the off-season, he owned and operated a boxing gym 
in Fontanet, Indiana. Devore stood at just 5'6". As a teenager, Devore 
played for the Meridian Ribboners of the Cotton States League, hitting 
poorly the two years he was there. However, in 1908 he moved the Eastern 
League and hit .290 for the Newark Indians. He joined the New York Giants 
in September, just in time to watch them lose a playoff game to the Chicago 
Cubs and finish second in the National League. Devore's first year as a 
regular was 1910, which was also the only year he hit .300 in the majors. 
In 1911, he finished second in the league with 61 stolen bases. In the 
1911 World Series, however, Devore went 0 for 3 in steal attempts and batted 
.167. In the following year's World Series, he improved to .250, but the 
Giants lost for the second straight time. Devore was traded to the Cincinnati 
Reds, then to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1913. In 1914, he was traded 
once more, to the Boston Braves; he arrived in time for the "Miracle Braves" 
stretch run which saw them win the National League pennant and World Series.[1] 
However, Devore batted .227 for Boston and was released the following January. 
He spent 1915 in the Ohio State League and played in various minor leagues 
until 1924. He was a player-manager for Grand Rapids of the Central League 
in 1920 and 1921.[2] Devore died at the age of 66 and was buried at New
