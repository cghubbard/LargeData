Shelby Charles Miller (born October 10, 1990) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Miller made his major league debut in 2012 with the St. Louis Cardinals 
and has also played for the Atlanta Braves. Drafted by the Cardinals out 
of Brownwood High School in the first round of the 2009 MLB draft, Miller 
became one of the sport's highest-rated prospects. He is a recipient of 
numerous awards, including the Cardinals' minor league pitcher of the year 
in 2010, Baseball America's number one Cardinals prospect from 2009–11, 
and selection to the All-Star Futures Game in 2010 and 2011. A fourth award, 
MLB.com's Pitching Performance of the Month, was the result of his first 
MLB complete game shutout in May 2013, a one-hitter against the Colorado 
Rockies. After the 2014 season, the Cardinals traded Miller to the Braves. 
In 2015, Miller was named to the MLB All-Star Game. That offseason, the 
Braves traded Miller to the Diamondbacks. Miller was born in Houston, Texas, 
and attended Brownwood High School in Brownwood, Texas. He played for the 
school's baseball team as a pitcher. In his sophomore year, he threw a 
no-hitter and helped lead his team to the regional semifinals.[1] As a 
junior in 2008, Miller threw three no-hitters in consecutive games, including 
one perfect game.[1] In Miller's senior year, he pitched to a 10–2 win–loss 
record with a 1.90 earned run average (ERA), and recorded 153 strikeouts 
in 77 2⁄3 innings pitched, with his fastball recorded as fast as 97 miles 
per hour (156 km/h). He drew comparisons to fellow Texas power pitchers 
Nolan Ryan and Josh Beckett.[2] In addition to baseball, he played tight 
end and defensive end for the school's American football team.[3] He played 
quarterback until the seventh grade, when he suffered a staph infection, 
allowing Casey Pachall to win the role.[4] Miller committed to attend Texas 
A&M University on a scholarship to play college baseball for the Texas 
A&M Aggies baseball team.[5] The St. Louis Cardinals selected Miller in 
the first round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft.[6] Rather than 
attend Texas A&M, Miller signed with the Cardinals, receiving a $2.875 million 
signing bonus on the August 17 deadline. The Cardinals assigned him to 
the Quad Cities River Bandits of the Class A Midwest League, where he made 
two appearances.[7] He returned to Quad Cities for the 2010 season, where 
he compiled a 7–5 win-loss record, a 3.62 ERA, 140 strikeouts and 33 walks 
in 104 1⁄3 innings pitched.[8][9] During the season, he appeared in the 
All-Star Futures Game.[10][11] He was named the Cardinals' minor league 
pitcher of the year after the season.[12] Miller began the 2011 season 
with the Palm Beach Cardinals of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League 
(FSL). He was named the Cardinal Nation pitcher of the month for May 2011 
after posting a 2.32 ERA for the month, and was promoted to the Springfield 
Cardinals of the Class AA Texas League at the beginning of June. At the 
time of his promotion, he led the FSL with 81 strikeouts, and was considered 
the best pitching prospect in baseball by Keith Law of ESPN.com.[13][14] 
Along with Carlos Martínez, Miller represented the Cardinals at the 2011 
All-Star Futures Game.[15] He made Baseball America's top prospect list 
in the 2011 midseason.[16] The Cardinals named Miller their minor league 
pitcher of the month for June 2011.[17] He pitched to a 9–3 win-loss record 
with a 2.70 ERA with 89 strikeouts in 86 2⁄3 innings pitched with Springfield.[18] 
Miller totaled 25 starts with Palm Beach and Springfield, completing 139 1⁄2 
innings and allowing a 2.70 ERA, 112 hits, 53 walks, and striking out 170 
batters for an average of 11.0 strikeouts per nine innings pitched (K/9).[19] 
After the season, Baseball America rated his fastball as the best in the 
Cardinals system, and named him a starting pitcher on their 2011 Minor 
League All-Star team.[20] He was again named the Cardinals' Minor League 
Pitcher of the Year.[18] Miller entered the 2012 season ranked as the fifth 
best prospect in baseball by MLB.com.[8] After competing for a spot on 
the Cardinals roster, he began the 2012 season with the Memphis Redbirds 
of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL).[18] Though he struggled in 
the beginning of the 2012 season, pitching to an ERA above 6.00 through 
the beginning of July, Miller pitched to an ERA below 3.00 for the remainder 
of the minor league season,[21] and recorded 160 strikeouts for the Redbirds 
in 137 innings pitched.[22] Miller made his MLB debut on September 5, 2012, 
against the New York Mets, as a relief pitcher. He threw two shutout innings, 
giving up one hit, walking none, and striking out four.[23] Amidst the 
Cardinals' competition for a playoff spot, Miller recorded his first major 
league win as a reliever in an extra inning game against the Los Angeles 
Dodgers on September 16.[24] Miller started his first major league game 
on October 3, against the Cincinnati Reds. Miller pitched six shutout innings, 
allowing only one hit, and striking out seven. He appeared twice in relief 
for the Cardinals during the 2012 National League Championship Series (NLCS) 
against the San Francisco Giants, allowing four hits and two runs in 3 1⁄3 
innings.[25] For the season, Miller completed 153 2⁄3 innings combined 
in the major league regular season, postseason and minor leagues.[26] Miller 
made the Cardinals' Opening Day starting rotation for the 2013 season,[25] 
following a spring training competition with Joe Kelly for the final spot 
in the rotation.[22] He threw his first career shutout in a 3–0 win against 
the Colorado Rockies on May 10, 2013.[27] After allowing a bloop single 
to Eric Young, Jr. to begin the match, Miller pitched the equivalent of 
a perfect game by retiring the next 27 batters in a row. He threw 113 pitches, 
84 for strikes. He walked none, striking out a career-high 13, which tied 
the Cardinals' rookie record, also held by Dick Hughes and Scipio Spinks. 
It was the closest a Cardinals' rookie came to throwing a no-hitter since 
Bud Smith performed the feat in 2001.[28][29][30] His Game Score of 98 
was the highest ever for a nine inning game thrown by a Cardinals pitcher. 
Miller's season performance vaunted him as an early Rookie of the Year 
award favorite.[31] He won the Pitching Performance of the Month award 
for May because of his one-hit game on May 10. He had a 2–1 win-loss record, 
walking only six and striking out 32 for the month, while leading the NL 
with a 1.82 ERA.[32] The shortest start of Miller's career occurred in 
an August 7 start against the Los Angeles Dodgers. On the second pitch 
of the game, a line drive off Carl Crawford's bat glanced struck Miller's 
right elbow. He was removed from the game at that point. Follow-up x-rays 
were negative and the injury was characterized as an elbow contusion.[33] 
His ERA to that point in the season was 2.89 and he averaged 9.8 K/9.[34] 
On September 11, Miller continued his dominance over the Milwaukee Brewers, 
allowing five hits and striking out four in 6 2⁄3 innings.[35] Despite 
Miller picking up his 14th win on September 15, his ERA from August 1 until 
that point was 3.60, raising it 3.19 for the season.[36] In Miller's final 
start of the season, he won his 15th game, defeating the Washington Nationals. 
In turn, Jordan Zimmerman was denied his 20th victory.[37] As teammate 
Adam Wainwright defeated the Chicago Cubs in his final start of the season 
on September 28, 2013, he tied Zimmerman for the league lead in wins.[38] 
Miller's 15 wins tied for sixth and his 3.06 ERA was tenth in the NL.[26] 
Although Miller was on the roster for all three series in the Cardinals' 
2013 postseason run, manager Mike Matheny did not place him in the starting 
rotation. Instead, he totaled a single inning in one relief appearance 
against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 2013 National League Division Series 
(NLDS), in which he gave up one home run.[39] Matheny rebuffed the suggestion 
that he was a "misspent asset" on the 25-man roster. He specified that, 
"He's going to be a guy we’re going to use if we get into a situation where 
we’ve got a bunch of innings to eat up, whether it's at the front end or 
back. He's going to be our guy (if) we have to put things together."[40] 
After losing the World Series in six games to the Boston Red Sox, Matheny 
and general manager John Mozeliak explained that Miller's role was as "insurance." 
In just one game until Michael Wacha's final start – which was the final 
game of the year – did a starter go less than five innings. Miller also 
became less effective as the season progressed late, with his strikeout 
rate decreasing and walk rate increasing. Said Matheny, "It would have 
to be a situation where we were pushing into a tight spot, and that's just 
not fair to him without having much action to this point. He's been exactly 
what we’ve needed up to this point. Fortunately we haven’t needed that 
long outing." Mozeliak added that "second-guessing the roster doesn’t have 
traction. His role was always that insurance. There were a lot of question 
marks as we were going into this on exactly how our rotation was going 
to unfold. The fact that everybody has stepped up changed the dynamic."[41] 
After the season, Baseball America named Miller to their All-Rookie team 
as a starting pitcher.[42] He finished third in the NL Rookie of the Year 
balloting.[43] Having struggled with walks, command, and mechanical inconsistencies 
the first two months of the 2014 season, Miller added a sinker to his repertoire 
with the help of Justin Masterson and defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 5–0 
in a complete-game shutout, his first of the season and second of his career. 
He took a no-hitter into the sixth inning, faced 30 total batters while 
striking out five and enjoyed much more consistent command.[44][45] He 
finished the season with a 3.74 ERA in 31 games started.[46] Miller pitched 
Game 4 of the 2014 NLDS, which the Cardinals won,[47] and Game 4 of the 
2014 NLCS, where he struggled, failing to complete the fourth inning.[48] 
On November 17, 2014, the Cardinals traded Miller and prospect Tyrell Jenkins 
to the Atlanta Braves for outfielder Jason Heyward and relief pitcher Jordan 
Walden.[46] On May 5, 2015, Miller threw a complete game shutout in just 
99 pitches against the Philadelphia Phillies.[49] Twelve days later, Miller 
was one out away from throwing a no-hitter against the Miami Marlins at 
Marlins Park when pinch hitter Justin Bour singled to break up the bid. 
Miller settled for a two-hit shutout, beating the Marlins 6–0. After the 
game, he improved to a 5–1 record and 1.33 ERA.[50] Miller was selected 
to his first All-Star Game via the player balloting. His ERA up to that 
point was 2.07, which was the third lowest in all of baseball.[51] However, 
Miller didn't appear in the game at all. The two-hitter against the Marlins 
would serve as Miller's last win until his final start of the season, on 
October 4, when he pitched eight innings in a shutout effort against the 
St. Louis Cardinals.[52] Miller set a new franchise record winless streak 
of 24,[53] despite quality starts in fourteen of those games.[54] His ERA 
during the streak was 3.83, and was marred by a rocky September, in which 
he recorded a 7.11 ERA.[55] Until the October 4, 6–0 win against his former 
team, Miller's run support was at 2.3 runs per nine innings, ranking him 
third on a list of worst run support compiled since 1975.[56] He finished 
the season with 2.6 runs of support per nine innings, a 6–17 record, 3.02 
ERA, and 173 strikeouts.[57] A run support average of 2.38 ranked tenth 
worst in MLB history.[58] On December 9, 2015, the Braves traded Miller 
and Gabe Speier to the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for Dansby Swanson, 
Ender Inciarte, and Aaron Blair.[59] Following the trade, Miller agreed 
to a contract worth $4.35 million.[60] Before the 2016 season began, Miller 
was projected to follow ace Zack Greinke in the rotation.[61] He struggled 
once the season began,[62] and was placed on the disabled list on May 24 
due to a sprained index finger, making his return on June 20.[63] Miller 
pitched to a 2–9 record and a 7.14 ERA through the MLB All-Star break, 
when the Diamondbacks optioned him to the Reno Aces of the PCL.[64] Miller 
was recalled to start against the San Francisco Giants on August 31. He 
pitched five innings, yielding two runs on six hits.[65] Whereas most starting 
pitchers utilize a fastball, a changeup, and a breaking ball, such as a 
slider or a curveball, Miller throws a fastball and curveball over 98% 
of the time. His fastball averages 94 miles per hour (151 km/h).[66] Miller 
has three sisters.[68] His father, Mitch, is a member of the Brownwood 
Fire Department in Miller's hometown. Shannon Stone, a friend of the family 
and member of the Brownwood Fire Department, died at Rangers Ballpark in 
Arlington in 2011 when he reached for a ball tossed into the stands by 
Josh Hamilton and fell.[69] Miller proposed to his girlfriend of two years, 
Amy Peters, on September 5, 2013. They were married on November 16, 2013.[70] 
He is close friends with his former Cardinals teammate, Joe Kelly; they
