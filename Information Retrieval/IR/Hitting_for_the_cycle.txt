In baseball, hitting for the cycle is the accomplishment of one batter 
hitting a single, a double, a triple, and a home run in the same game.[1] 
Collecting the hits in that order is known as a "natural cycle".[2] Cycles 
are rare in Major League Baseball (MLB), and have occurred only 309 times 
since the first by Curry Foley in 1882.[3] The most recent example was 
accomplished by John Jaso of the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 28, 2016, 
against the Chicago Cubs.[4] To this day, the Miami Marlins are the only 
MLB franchise who have never had a player perform the feat.[5] The cycle 
is about as uncommon as a no-hitter (288 occurrences in MLB history);[6][7] 
it has been called "one of the rarest"[8] and "most difficult feats"[9] 
in baseball. Based on 2009 offensive levels, the probability of an average 
MLB player hitting for a cycle against an average team in a game is approximately 
0.00590%; this corresponds to about 2.5 cycles in a 162-game season with 
30 teams.[10] In other baseball leagues, the cycle is achieved less frequently. 
Through September 4, 2008, 63 players in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), 
the top-level baseball organization in Japan, have hit for the cycle,[11][12] 
the most recent being Rainel Rosario.[13] Two players have hit for the 
cycle on the same day once in NPB history; this has occurred twice in MLB 
history. One NPB player has also hit for the cycle in an NPB All-Star game. 
No player has ever hit for the cycle in the MLB All-Star Game or the postseason.[14] 
Pursuant to Major League Baseball (MLB) Rule 6.09(a), "[the] batter becomes 
a runner when he hits a fair ball".[15] The single is the most common type 
of hit in baseball: for example, there were 25,838 singles hit during the 
1988 MLB season, compared to 6,386 doubles, 840 triples, or 3,180 home 
runs.[16] The MLB leader in singles is Pete Rose, who is also the league's 
all-time hit leader.[17] The single-season leader in singles is Ichiro 
Suzuki, who broke Willie Keeler's 106-year-old record in 2004 by notching 
225, 19 more than the previous record.[18] None of the top five players 
in singles (Rose, Ty Cobb, Eddie Collins, Cap Anson, and Keeler) in MLB 
history have hit for the cycle;[3] of those five, only Rose had more than 
150 home runs,[19] and two (Collins and Keeler), who both played during 
the dead-ball era, had fewer than 50,[20][21] lessening the probability 
of their completing the cycle. A double is a safe hit in which the batter 
reaches second base without being called out. This scenario often occurs 
when a ball is hit into the gaps between the outfielders, or down the foul 
line on either side of the playing field.[22] Tris Speaker is the all-time 
leader in doubles in MLB history, with 792,[23] one of which was part of 
a cycle; Speaker accomplished the feat for the Boston Red Sox on June 9, 
1912, against the St. Louis Browns.[3] Two of the other top five players 
in MLB history in doubles have hit for the cycle: Stan Musial (725 doubles; 
third all-time) completed the cycle on July 24, 1949; and Craig Biggio 
(668; fifth all-time) accomplished the feat on April 8, 2002.[3] The single-season 
MLB leader is Earl Webb, the left-handed outfielder who hit 67 in 1931.[24] 
The triple, in which the batter reaches third base without being put out 
and without the benefit of a fielding error, is often called the "hardest 
part of the cycle" to complete.[25] Hitting a triple often comes under 
similar hit placement as a double, but may require impressive speed on 
the part of the runner.[26] Because of this, it is rare to see a player 
with slower-than-average running speed complete the cycle, but it has happened, 
such as when catcher Bengie Molina hit for the cycle on July 16, 2010; 
Molina described himself as "the [slowest] guy in baseball" earlier that 
season.[27] The MLB all-time leader in triples is Sam Crawford, who completed 
the three-base hit 309 times in his career;[28] however, none of those 
triples was ever part of a cycle. Of the top five players in MLB history 
in triples, two – Honus Wagner and Roger Connor—have hit for the cycle: 
Connor in 1890 and Wagner in 1912.[3] The MLB single-season record holder 
for triples, Chief Wilson, hit for the cycle in 1910,[3] two years before 
his record-setting season in which he hit 36 triples.[29] A home run is 
a hit in which the player reaches home plate, and scores a run on the same 
play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this occurs 
when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory. However, 
it can occur on a ball hit to the outfield with a fast runner when the 
ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park 
home run.[26] Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players 
due to their strength, and may not be fast enough to complete the triple.[26] 
The MLB single-season and all-time leader in home runs is Barry Bonds, 
who hit 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season 
career.[30][31] Bonds never hit for the cycle.[32] The highest on the list 
to do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 695 home runs as of June 25, 
2016),[33] who hit for the cycle on June 5, 1997.[3] The most cycles hit 
by a single player in Major League Baseball is three, accomplished by four 
players: Reilly (1884), Tip O'Neill (1887), Herman (1931), and Aaron Hill 
(2012) are the only players in MLB history who have hit for the cycle twice 
in one season. The most cycles hit in a single major league season is eight.[3] 
Cycles have occurred on the same day twice in Major League Baseball history: 
on September 17, 1920, hit by Bobby Veach of the Detroit Tigers and George 
Burns of the New York Giants; and again on September 1, 2008, when the 
Arizona Diamondbacks' Stephen Drew and the Seattle Mariners' Adrián Beltré 
each completed the four-hit group.[34] Conversely, the longest period of 
time between two players hitting for the cycle was 5 years, 1 month, and 
10 days, a drought lasting from Bill Joyce's cycle in 1896 to Harry Davis' 
in 1901.[3] The natural cycle, in which the hits come in order from least 
total bases to most (single, double, triple, and home run), has been accomplished 
14 times in MLB history. Bill Collins was the first to collect the hits 
in order on October 6, 1910. The natural cycle happened most commonly in 
the 1960s, occurring three times in a four-year span (Jim Hickman in 1963, 
Ken Boyer in 1964, and Billy Williams in 1966).[35] It also occurred three 
times in a seven-season timeframe from 2000 to 2006: José Valentín in 2000; 
Brad Wilkerson in 2003;[35] and Gary Matthews, Jr. in 2006.[36] The natural 
cycle has also been accomplished in reverse (home run, triple, double, 
single) by six players: Bid McPhee (1887);[37]Gee Walker (1937);[38]Jim 
Fregosi (1968; his second cycle);[39] Luke Scott (2006);[40] Carlos Gómez 
(2008);[41] and Rajai Davis (2016). Eight players have hit a grand slam 
as the home run of their cycle; in the 21st century, that list has included 
Miguel Tejada, Jason Kubel, and Bengie Molina.[42] Five players have hit 
a walk-off home run to win the game as the final hit of their cycles: Boyer,[43] 
César Tovar,[44] George Brett,[45] Dwight Evans,[46] and Carlos González.[47] 
In 2009, Ian Kinsler had six hits in the game when he hit his cycle;[48] 
the accomplishment came on Jackie Robinson Day, honoring the African-American 
pioneer who had himself hit for the cycle on August 29, 1948.[3] Four batters 
hit for the cycle in the same season in which they won the Triple Crown: 
Nap Lajoie (American League) in 1901; Jimmie Foxx (American League) and 
Chuck Klein (National League) in 1933; and Lou Gehrig (American League) 
in 1934.[3][49] Gehrig is the only player to complete the MLB Triple Crown 
in his cycle-hitting season, leading both the National and American Leagues 
in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in. When Foxx and Klein 
won in the same season, each was playing for a team in Philadelphia: Klein 
for the Phillies and Foxx for the Athletics.[49] Three players – John Olerud, 
Michael Cuddyer, and Bob Watson—have hit for the cycle in both the National 
and American Leagues. Family pairs to hit for the cycle include father 
and son Gary and Daryle Ward, who accomplished the feat in 1980 and 2004, 
respectively; and grandfather and grandson Gus and David Bell, the elder 
of whom hit for the cycle in 1951, and the younger in 2004.[3] Harry Danning, 
on June 15, 1940, became the last player so far to hit for the cycle with 
his home run coming on an inside-the-park home run.[50] Two players – Joe 
Cronin and Adrián Beltré – have hit for the cycle as a member of a club 
and as a member of that club's opponent (Cronin with the Washington Senators 
against the Boston Red Sox and later with the Red Sox; Beltre with the 
Seattle Mariners against the Texas Rangers and later with the Rangers). 
Beltre hit another as a Texas Ranger on August 3, 2015 having done so by 
the 5th inning. All three of Beltre's cycles came at Rangers Ballpark in 
Arlington, the only player to have three cycles at the same ballpark with 
two different teams. During his eight seasons playing for the Yokohama 
BayStars, Bobby Rose hit for three cycles, the most of any Nippon Professional 
Baseball player. Each spaced two seasons apart, his first cycle occurred 
on May 2, 1995, the next on April 29, 1997, and his final cycle on June 
30, 1999. Other than Rose, only two NPB players have hit multiple cycles: 
Fumio Fujimura with the Osaka Tigers and Hiromi Matsunaga with the Hankyu/Orix 
Braves, both with two. Fujimura is also the only player to have hit a cycle 
during both the single league era and the current dual league era.[51] 
The 2003 NPB season saw the most cycles hit in a single season—five.[51] 
That season also saw the only instance of cycles occurring on the same 
day: on July 1, hit by Atsunori Inaba of the Yakult Swallows and Arihito 
Muramatsu of the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks.[52] The next day, Shinjiro Hiyama 
became the third player to hit for the cycle in two days.[53] Conversely, 
the longest period of time between two players hitting for the cycle was 
3 years, 5 months, and 9 days, a drought lasting from Alex Ochoa's cycle 
in 2004 to Julio Zuleta's in 2007.[51] The natural cycle has been accomplished 
five times in NPB history. Fumio Fujimura's second cycle on May 25, 1950, 
was the first time a player collected the hits in order. On average, the 
natural cycle occurs approximately every 13 years. Other than Fujimura, 
the four players to hit for the natural cycle are Kazuhiko Kondo in 1961, 
Takahiro Tokutsu in 1976, Takanori Okamura in 1985, and Muramatsu in 2003. 
The natural cycle has only been accomplished in reverse by Ochoa (2004).[51] 
When Ochoa hit his cycle with the Chunichi Dragons on April 13, 2004, he 
became the only player to hit a cycle in both Major League Baseball and 
Nippon Professional Baseball. Eight years earlier, Ochoa had accomplished 
the same feat on July 3, 1996, while playing for MLB's New York Mets.[54] 
Yakult Swallows catcher Atsuya Furuta is the only player to hit for the 
cycle in an NPB All-Star game, doing so in game 2 of the 1992 series.[55] 
Inaba is the only player to hit for the cycle in a rain-shortened game. 
After hitting a triple in the first inning and hitting a home run in the 
fourth, Inaba collected the other two necessary hits in a seven-run fifth 
inning when the order batted around.[52] Kosuke Fukudome is the only player 
to have hit a grand slam as the home run of the cycle.[56] Hiroshi Ohshita 
and Kazuhiko Kondo are the only two players have hit a walk-off home run
