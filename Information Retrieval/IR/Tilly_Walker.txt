Clarence William "Tilly" Walker (September 4, 1887[a] – September 21, 1959) 
was an American professional baseball player. After growing up in Limestone, 
Tennessee, and attending college locally at Washington College, he entered 
Major League Baseball (MLB). He was a left fielder and center fielder for 
the Washington Senators, St. Louis Browns, Boston Red Sox and Philadelphia 
Athletics from 1911 to 1923. In 1918, he tied Babe Ruth for the home run 
crown that season. His power output increased for three seasons beginning 
in 1920. In 1922, he finished second in the league in home runs and he 
became one of five players to have reached 100 career home runs. He struggled 
in his final MLB season and was released by Philadelphia. After his MLB 
career, Walker played for several seasons in the minor leagues. He also 
managed a minor league team for one season and worked for the Tennessee 
Highway Patrol. Walker was born in Telford, Tennessee.[1][a] His family 
moved to Limestone, Tennessee, when he was a child.[2] His father, W. N. 
Walker, was an undertaker and a member of the local county high school 
board of education.[3][4] Walker later recalled that there was not much 
to do in Limestone, so he developed his throwing ability by tossing rocks.[2] 
He pitched and played right field for the baseball team at Washington College 
in Limestone in the 1908–09 and 1909–10 school years.[5] Walker's professional 
baseball career began with the Spartanburg Spartans of the Carolina Association 
in 1910 and 1911.[6] Hitting for a .390 batting average with Spartanburg 
in 35 games in 1911, Walker caught the attention of the Washington Senators. 
The team purchased Walker's contract from Spartanburg and played him in 
95 major league games. Walker finished the season with a .278 average, 
2 home runs and 12 stolen bases.[1] Starting the 1912 season with the Senators, 
he hit .273 through 35 games, but he committed 8 errors.[1] The Senators 
started that season poorly, so manager Clark Griffith sold his contract 
to the minor-league Kansas City Blues in an attempt to overhaul his team.[7] 
Walker said that he had been present when Griffith handed a telegram to 
a telegraph operator one night. Owing to telegraphy experience from a boyhood 
job, Walker heard the Morse Code and realized that the telegram was requesting 
waivers on him. He was sold to the Blues after no major league teams were 
interested. He considered returning to Limestone as a telegraph operator, 
but he ultimately went to the Blues.[2] Walker spent most of 1913 with 
the Blues, hitting .306 with 6 home runs. He made it back to the major 
leagues that year with the St. Louis Browns, appearing in 23 games.[1] 
According to Nellie King, Browns manager Branch Rickey compared Walker 
to Ty Cobb in terms of ability, saying that they differed only because 
Cobb displayed more effort.[8] Walker hit .278 with 6 home runs, 78 runs 
batted in (RBI) and a career-high 29 stolen bases in 151 games during the 
1914 season. His offensive totals dropped with the 1915 Browns; he finished 
with a .269 average, 5 home runs, 49 RBI and 20 steals. Just before the 
1916 season, the Boston Red Sox purchased Walker's contract for US$3,500 
($76,240 today).[1] The purchase of Walker indirectly facilitated the sale 
of Red Sox star outfielder Tris Speaker to the Cleveland Indians; the Walker 
deal signaled to Cleveland executives that Boston was looking to trade 
Speaker, so Cleveland executives began negotiations with the Red Sox that 
resulted in Speaker's purchase for $55,000.[9] Walker was seen as a good 
hitter and he had a strong arm, having led the league's outfielders in 
assists for the two previous seasons. However, he had been criticized for 
his mood swings and for not being a team player.[10] Walker earned one 
of his lowest batting averages (.266) that year, but Boston won the 1916 
World Series. In that series, he batted twelve times and earned three hits, 
including a triple. He played only 106 games in 1917, hitting a career-low 
.246 for the Red Sox. Before the 1918 season, Walker was sent to the Philadelphia 
Athletics as the player to be named later in a multiplayer trade for first 
baseman Stuffy McInnis. He tied Ruth as the league leader in homeruns (11) 
in 1918.[1] In 1919, Walker and two other American League (AL) players 
each hit 10 home runs, while Ruth hit 29.[11] After the introduction of 
a new type of ball in 1920, Walker slugged 17 home runs. He registered 
home run totals of 23 the next year and 37 in 1922.[12] He finished second 
in the AL in home runs in 1922, ahead of Ruth and trailing Ken Williams 
by two home runs.[13] Walker passed 100 career home runs that year, becoming 
one of the first five major league players to reach that milestone.[14] 
After the 1922 season, Athletics manager Connie Mack opted to prioritize 
pitching and defense over hitting, so he moved the fences 30 to 40 feet 
deeper in Philadelphia. Walker struggled under the new conditions and played 
only 52 games in 1923.[12] Walker was given an unconditional release from 
the Athletics in December 1923.[15] He returned to the minor leagues for 
the 1924 season.[6] Walker spent six years with the Minneapolis Millers, 
Baltimore Orioles, Toronto Maple Leafs and Greenville Spinners. He hit 
for double-digit home run totals five times as a minor league player, including 
a 1928 season in which he hit 33 home runs. The 1929 season was his last; 
he appeared in only 12 games that year.[6] He spent a year as an umpire 
in the Piedmont League in 1934.[16] In 1940, he was the manager of the 
Erwin Mountaineers in the Appalachian League.[6] Beginning in 1940, Walker 
worked as a patrolman for the Tennessee Highway Patrol, stationed in Bristol.[17][18] 
He made his home in Limestone.[3] In 1959, he died of natural causes at 
his brother's home in Unicoi, Tennessee.[19] He is buried at Urbana Cemetery
