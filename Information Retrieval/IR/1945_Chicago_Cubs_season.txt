The 1945 Chicago Cubs season was the 74th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 70th in the National League and the 30th at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
won the National League pennant with a record of 98â€“56, 3 games ahead of 
the second-place St. Louis Cardinals. The team went on to the 1945 World 
Series, which they lost to the Detroit Tigers in seven games. It would 
take 71 years before the Cubs made it to another World Series. [1] [2]

that was started in 1945. As the story goes, Billy Sianis, a Greek immigrant 
(from Paleopyrgos, Greece[1]), who owned a nearby tavern (the now-famous 
Billy Goat Tavern), had two $7.20 box seat tickets to Game 4 of the 1945 
World Series between the Chicago Cubs and the Detroit Tigers, and decided 
to bring along his pet goat, Murphy (or Sinovia according to some references), 
which Sianis had restored to health when the goat had fallen off a truck 
and subsequently limped into his tavern. The goat wore a blanket with a 
sign pinned to it which read "We got Detroit's goat".[2] Sianis and the 
goat were allowed into Wrigley Field and even paraded about on the playing 
field before the game before ushers intervened and led them off the field. 
After a heated argument, both Sianis and the goat were permitted to stay 
in the stadium occupying the box seat for which he had tickets. At this 
point, Andy Frain (head of Wrigley Field's hired security company at the 
time), waved the goat's box-seat ticket in the air and proclaimed, "If 
he eats the ticket that would solve everything."[2] However, the goat did 
not. Before the game was over, it started to rain and Sianis and the goat 
were ejected from the stadium at the command of Cubs owner Philip Knight 
Wrigley due to the objectionable odor of wet goat. Sianis was outraged 
at the ejection and allegedly placed a curse upon the Cubs that they would 
never win another pennant or play in a World Series at Wrigley Field again 
because the Cubs organization had insulted his goat, and subsequently left 
the U.S. to vacation in his home in Greece. The Cubs lost Game 4 and eventually 
the 1945 World Series, prompting Sianis to write to Wrigley from Greece, 
saying, "Who stinks now?" October 3, 1945 at Briggs Stadium in Detroit
