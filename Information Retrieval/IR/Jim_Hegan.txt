James Edward Hegan (August 3, 1920 – June 17, 1984) was an American professional 
baseball player, coach and scout.[1] He played for seventeen seasons as 
a catcher in Major League Baseball from 1941 to 1942 and from 1946 to 1960, 
most notably for the Cleveland Indians.[1] After his playing career was 
over, he became a coach and scout in a baseball career that spanned almost 
40 years. While he was light-hitting as an offensive player, he was notable 
for being one of the best defensive catchers of his era and a capable handler 
of pitching staffs.[2][3] Born in Lynn, Massachusetts, Hegan was signed 
by the Cleveland Indians in 1938.[1][4] After playing in the minor leagues 
for four seasons, he made his major league debut with the Indians on September 
7, 1941 at the age of 20.[1] Hegan appeared in 68 games for the Indians 
in 1942, before joining the United States Coast Guard for the remainder 
of the Second World War.[5] When Hegan returned in 1946 he became the Indians 
regular starting catcher replacing Frankie Hayes. In his second season 
back after the war, Hegan was recognized as one of the top catchers in 
the American League when, he was selected as a reserve in the 1947 All-Star 
Game.[6] He had his best season offensively in 1948, posting a .248 batting 
average along with 14 home runs and 61 runs batted in, as the Indians finished 
the season tied for first place with the Boston Red Sox.[1][7] After defeating 
the Red Sox in a one-game playoff, the Indians went on to defeat the Boston 
Braves in the 1948 World Series.[8][9] Despite his low batting average, 
Hegan ended the season ranked in 19th place in the 1948 American League 
Most Valuable Player Award voting, due in part to his handling of the Indians' 
pitching staff which led the league in winning percentage, shutouts and 
in earned run average.[10][11] Hegan's pitch-calling skills continued to 
be made evident as, the Indian's pitching staff would lead the American 
League in earned run average every year from 1948 to 1951.[11][12][13][14] 
In 1951 and 1952, the Indians' pitching staff would have three twenty-game 
winning pitchers.[14][15] Cleveland pitchers gave Hegan credit for part 
of their success.[2][16] Cleveland Indian Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller 
was quoted as saying,"He was one of the best defensive catchers in baseball 
history. Jim called a good game. We disagreed rarely. Jim was very good 
at keeping pitchers calm."[2] Another Hall of Fame pitcher, Bob Lemon said 
of Hegan, "When I first started pitching, I used to shake him off sometimes. 
Invariably, they'd get a hit. So I stopped shaking him off."[2] In 1954, 
Hegan would again lead the Indians' pitching staff to the lowest earned 
run average in the league and committed only 4 errors in 137 games played 
as, the Indians won the American League pennant with a then-record 111 
victories in a 154-game season.[1][17][18] The Indians would eventually 
lose to the New York Giants in the 1954 World Series.[19] Hegan would once 
again guide the Indians' pitching staff to the league's lowest earned run 
average in 1956 as, the Indians boasted three twenty-game winning pitchers 
for the third time during his career.[20][21] After the 1957 season, Hegan 
was traded to the Detroit Tigers.[4] He was traded several more times before 
ending his playing career with the Chicago Cubs in 1960 at the age of 39.[4] 
Hegan would be the Indians starting catcher for 11 seasons from 1946 until 
1956.[22] In 1,666 games played, Hegan had a 1,087 hits for a .228 batting 
average, with 92 home runs and 525 runs batted in.[1] During his career, 
he led American League catchers three times in putouts, assists, double 
plays, total chances per game and fielding percentage and, had a career 
fielding percentage of .990.[2] At the time of his retirement in 1960, 
Hegan's .990 career fielding percentage was second only to Buddy Rosar 
among retired catchers. His 49.77% career caught stealing percentage ranks 
16th all-time among major league catchers.[23] Hegan caught 121 shutouts 
in his career, ranking him 9th all-time among major league catchers.[24] 
He is the Indians' all-time leader in games played as a catcher with 1,491.[25] 
As a testament to Hegan's pitch-calling skills, during this period, the 
Indians pitching staff was the best in baseball, leading the American League 
six times in earned run average.[26] Hegan was selected to be an American 
League All-Star five times during his playing career.[1] During his career, 
Hegan was the catcher for six twenty-game winning pitchers (Bob Feller, 
Bob Lemon, Gene Bearden, Early Wynn, Mike Garcia, Herb Score) and, caught 
three no hitters by Don Black (1947), Bob Lemon (1948) and Bob Feller (1951).[2] 
He caught for a record seven pitchers who would eventually be inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[27] Despite his considerable defensive 
skills, because he was a light-hitting player, Hegan is almost a forgotten 
man in major league baseball history.[3][16] Yankee Hall of Fame catcher, 
Bill Dickey, once said about Hegan's fielding abilities, "If I had been 
able to catch like Hegan I wouldn't have needed to hit".[3][28] He began 
his coaching career as a playing coach for the Cubs working under former 
Cleveland teammate Lou Boudreau in 1960. In mid-year, after his active 
career ended July 4, Hegan became the full-time bullpen coach for the New 
York Yankees, helping to mentor future catching stand outs Thurmon Munson 
and Rick Dempsey.[29] He served with the Yankees through the 1973 season. 
He then moved with manager Ralph Houk to the Detroit Tigers for five years, 
through 1978. He finished his career in uniform back with the Yankees as 
a coach (1979–80), and was serving as a scout for the Yankees when he died 
in Swampscott, Massachusetts, of a heart attack at the age of 63.[2] Hegan's 
son, Mike Hegan, was an All-Star first baseman who played major league 
baseball from 1964 to 1977, and was a sports commentator for the Indians
