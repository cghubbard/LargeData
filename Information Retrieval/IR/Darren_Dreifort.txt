Darren James Dreifort (born May 3, 1972) is a former Major League Baseball 
pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Dreifort played baseball in High School 
at Wichita Heights High School and was drafted out of High School by the 
New York Mets in 1990. He chose instead to attend college at Wichita State 
University. As a college ballplayer, Dreifort was a two-time consensus 
All-American and the 1993 NCAA Player of the Year. He was 26-5 with a 2.24 
ERA in his career at WSU on the mound and was also a great power hitter 
at the plate. Darren was inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame for 
his performance there. He was subsequently drafted in the 1st round (2nd 
overall behind Alex Rodriguez) in the 1993 Major League Baseball draft 
by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Dreifort became one of only a select few players 
to make his professional debut in the Majors, without first appearing in 
a minor league game. He made his debut on April 7, 1994 against the Florida 
Marlins, working one scoreless inning as a relief pitcher. He appeared 
in a total of 27 games for the Dodgers that season, finishing 0-5 with 
a 6.21 ERA. After missing the 1995 season due to injuries, Dreifort returned 
to the Dodgers bullpen for the 1996 and 1997 seasons, pitching effectively 
as a late inning setup man. He recorded his first career win on August 
30, 1996 in relief against the Philadelphia Phillies. In 1997 he was very 
good out of the pen, finishing 5-2 with a 2.86 ERA in 48 appearances and 
notched 4 saves. He transitioned to the starting rotation for the 1998 
season, making his first start on April 11 against the Houston Astros at 
Dodger Stadium, working five innings and taking the loss. He finished the 
season 8-12 with an ERA of 4.00. He continued to pitch effectively in 1999 
(13-13) and in 2000 turned in his best season with a 12-9 record, 4.16 
ERA in 32 starts and 164 strikeouts. A free agent after the 2000 season, 
Dreifort re-signed with the team, and received a five-year, $55 million 
contract in 2001, a large contract in spite of the fact that he had had 
a career record of 39-45, and a history of arm trouble. But, in 2001, with 
a limited free-agent pitching market, Dreifort's agent Scott Boras sold 
the Dodgers on the right-hander's future potential, hinting he might sign 
with their National League West rival, the Colorado Rockies. The Dodgers 
responded with the big contract. Dreifort's health shut him down during 
the very first season of the deal; he was finished in early July when he 
was forced to undergo elbow reconstruction surgery that kept him out until 
the end of 2002. With continuing arm and shoulder trouble, plus additional 
knee and hip trouble, Dreifort actually pitched in only three of the five 
years on the deal, also missing the entire 2005 season and parts of two 
other seasons during the life of the deal. In 2004, after team medical 
personnel advised the Dodgers Dreifort could not pitch as a starter due 
to his injuries, Dreifort became the Dodgers' seventh inning reliever in 
front of setup man Guillermo Mota and closer Éric Gagné. Dreifort pitched 
inconsistently due to knee and hip troubles in addition to older arm and 
shoulder issues. Dreifort's issues may be traceable to a degenerative condition 
that weakened his connective tissues, as well as a deformed femur that 
may have been the root of his hip problems, affecting in turn his ability 
to rotate his body properly, which could have affected his knees and his 
elbows as well.[1] He is reported to have had 22 surgeries total, 20 of 
them since leaving college to play professional baseball. Dreifort retired 
at age 32. He is married to former sports journalist Krystal Fernandez 
and lives in Pacific Palisades, California. He remains involved with baseball, 
working as a Dodgers minor league spring training instructor. Dreifort
