Oakland /ˈoʊklənd/ is the largest city and the county seat of Alameda County, 
California, United States. A major West Coast port city, Oakland is the 
third largest city in the San Francisco Bay Area, the eighth-largest city 
in California, and the 45th-largest city in the country, with a population 
of 419,267 as of 2015[update].[14] It serves as a trade center for the 
San Francisco Bay Area; its Port of Oakland is the busiest port in the 
San Francisco Bay, all of Northern California, and is the fifth busiest 
in the United States. Incorporated in 1852, Oakland is also the principal 
city of the Bay Area Region known as the East Bay. The city is located 
six miles (9.7 km) east of San Francisco. Oakland's territory covers what 
was once a mosaic of California coastal terrace prairie, oak woodland, 
and north coastal scrub. Its land served as a rich resource when its hillside 
oak and redwood timber were logged to build San Francisco, and Oakland's 
fertile flatland soils helped it become a prolific agricultural region. 
In the late 1860s, Oakland was selected as the western terminal of the 
Transcontinental Railroad. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, 
many San Francisco citizens moved to Oakland, enlarging the city's population, 
increasing its housing stock and improving its infrastructure. It continued 
to grow in the 20th century with its busy port, shipyards, and a thriving 
automobile manufacturing industry. Oakland is known for its sustainability 
practices, including a top ranking for usage of electricity from renewable 
resources. Oakland is also known for its history of political activism, 
as well as its professional sports franchises and major corporations, which 
include health care, dot-com companies, and manufacturers of household 
products. In addition, due to a steady influx of immigrants during the 
20th century, along with thousands of African-American war-industry workers 
who relocated from the Deep South during the 1940s, Oakland is one of the 
most ethnically diverse major cities in the country. The earliest known 
inhabitants were the Huchiun Indians, who lived there for thousands of 
years. The Huchiun belonged to a linguistic grouping later called the Ohlone 
(a Miwok word meaning "western people").[16] In Oakland, they were concentrated 
around Lake Merritt and Temescal Creek, a stream that enters the San Francisco 
Bay at Emeryville. In 1772, the area that later became Oakland was claimed, 
with the rest of California, by Spanish settlers for the King of Spain. 
In the early 19th century, the Spanish crown granted the East Bay area 
to Luis María Peralta for his Rancho San Antonio. The grant was confirmed 
by the successor Mexican republic upon its independence from Spain.[17] 
Upon his death in 1842, Peralta divided his land among his four sons. Most 
of Oakland fell within the shares given to Antonio Maria and Vicente.[18] 
The portion of the parcel that is now Oakland was called encinal—Spanish 
for "oak grove"—due to the large oak forest that covered the area, which 
eventually led to the city's name.[19] In 1851, three men—Horace Carpentier, 
Edson Adams, and Andrew Moon—began developing what is now downtown Oakland. 
On May 4, 1852, the Town of Oakland incorporated. Two years later, on March 
25, 1854, Oakland re-incorporated as the City of Oakland, with Horace Carpentier 
elected the first mayor, though a scandal ended his mayorship in less than 
a year. The city and its environs quickly grew with the railroads, becoming 
a major rail terminal in the late 1860s and 1870s. In 1868, the Central 
Pacific constructed the Oakland Long Wharf at Oakland Point, the site of 
today's Port of Oakland. A number of horsecar and cable car lines were 
constructed in Oakland during the latter half of the 19th century. The 
first electric streetcar set out from Oakland to Berkeley in 1891, and 
other lines were converted and added over the course of the 1890s. The 
various streetcar companies operating in Oakland were acquired by Francis 
"Borax" Smith and consolidated into what eventually became known as the 
Key System, the predecessor of today's publicly owned AC Transit. At the 
time of incorporation, Oakland consisted of the territory that lay south 
of today's major intersection of San Pablo Avenue, Broadway, and Fourteenth 
Street. The city gradually annexed farmlands and settlements to the east 
and the north. Oakland's rise to industrial prominence, and its subsequent 
need for a seaport, led to the digging of a shipping and tidal channel 
in 1902. This resulted in the nearby town of Alameda being made an island. 
In 1906, the city's population doubled with refugees made homeless after 
the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. In 1916, General Motors opened 
a major automobile factory in East Oakland called Oakland Assembly. It 
produced Chevrolet cars and then GMC trucks until 1963, when it was moved 
to Fremont in southern Alameda County.[20] Also in 1916, the Fageol Motor 
Company chose East Oakland for their first factory, manufacturing farming 
tractors from 1918 to 1923.[21][22] By 1920, Oakland was the home of numerous 
manufacturing industries, including metals, canneries, bakeries, internal 
combustion engines, automobiles, and shipbuilding.[23] By 1929, when Chrysler 
expanded with a new plant there, Oakland had become known as the "Detroit 
of the West," referring to the major auto manufacturing center in Michigan.[24] 
Oakland expanded during the 1920s, as its population expanded with factory 
workers. Approximately 13,000 homes were built in the 3 years between 1921 
and 1924,[25] more than during the 13 years between 1907 and 1920.[26] 
Many of the large downtown office buildings, apartment buildings, and single-family 
houses still standing in Oakland were built during the 1920s; they reflect 
the architectural styles of the time. Russell Clifford Durant established 
Durant Field at 82nd Avenue and East 14th Street in 1916.[27] The first 
transcontinental airmail flight finished its journey at Durant Field on 
August 9, 1920, flown by Army Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker and Navy Lt. Bert 
Acosta.[28] Durant Field was often called Oakland Airport, though the current 
Oakland International Airport was soon established four miles (6.4 km) 
to the southwest.[29] During World War II, the East Bay Area was home to 
many war-related industries. Oakland's Moore Dry Dock Company expanded 
its shipbuilding capabilities and built over 100 ships. Valued at $100 million 
in 1943, Oakland's canning industry was its second-most-valuable war contribution 
after shipbuilding. The largest canneries were in the Fruitvale District, 
and included the Josiah Lusk Canning Company, the Oakland Preserving Company 
(which started the Del Monte brand), and the California Packing Company.[30] 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt called on defense industries with government 
contracts to integrate their workforces and provide opportunities for all 
Americans. Tens of thousands of laborers were attracted from around the 
country, and especially poor whites and blacks from the Deep South: Alabama, 
Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas, as 
well as Missouri and Tennessee. Henry J. Kaiser's representatives recruited 
sharecroppers and tenant farmers from rural areas to work in his shipyards. 
African Americans were part of the Great Migration by which a total of 
five million persons left the South, mostly for the West, in the years 
from 1940 to 1970. White migrants from the Jim Crow South carried their 
racial attitudes, causing tensions to rise among black and white workers 
competing for the better-paying jobs in the Bay Area. The racial harmony 
that Oakland blacks had been accustomed to prior to the war evaporated.[31] 
Also migrating to the area during this time were many Mexican Americans 
from southwestern states such as New Mexico, Texas, and Colorado. Many 
worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad, at its major rail yard in West 
Oakland. Their young men encountered hostility and discrimination by Armed 
Forces personnel, and tensions broke out in "zoot suit riots" in downtown 
Oakland in 1943 in the wake of a major disturbance in Los Angeles that 
year.[32] In 1946 National City Lines (NCL), a General Motors holding company, 
acquired 64% of Key System stock; during the next several years NCL engaged 
in the conspiratorial dissolution of Oakland's electric streetcar system. 
The city's expensive electric streetcar fleet was converted to the cheaper 
diesel buses.[33] The state Legislature created the Alameda and Contra 
Costa Transit District in 1955, which operates today as AC Transit, the 
third-largest bus-only transit system in the nation.[34] Soon after the 
war, as Oakland's shipbuilding industry declined and the automobile industry 
went through restructuring, many jobs were lost. Economic competition increased 
racial tension.[35] In addition, labor unrest increased as workers struggled 
to protect their livelihoods. Oakland was the center of a general strike 
during the first week of December 1946, one of six cities across the country 
that had such a strike after World War II.[36] In 1960, Kaiser Corporation 
erected its headquarters; it was the largest skyscraper in Oakland, as 
well as "the largest office tower west of Chicago" up to that time.[37] 
In the postwar period, suburban development increased around Oakland, and 
wealthier residents moved to new housing. Despite the major increases in 
the number and proportion of African Americans in the city, in 1966 only 
16 of the city's 661 police officers were black. Tensions between the black 
community and the largely white police force were high, as expectations 
during the civil rights era increased to gain social justice and equality 
before the law. Police abuse of blacks was common.[38][39] Students Huey 
Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party at Merritt College 
to emphasize black power and taking care of their own community. Among 
their social programs were feeding children and providing other services 
to the needy. During the 1970s, Oakland began to suffer serious violence 
and other problems related to gang-controlled dealing of heroin and cocaine 
when drug kingpin Felix Mitchell created the nation's first large-scale 
operation of this kind.[35] Both violent crime and property crime increased 
during this period, and Oakland's murder rate rose to twice that .[35] 
As in many other American cities during the 1980s, crack cocaine became 
a serious problem in Oakland. Drug dealing in general, and the dealing 
of crack cocaine in particular, resulted in elevated rates of violent crime, 
causing Oakland to consistently be listed as one of America's most crime-ridden 
cities.[40] In 1980 Oakland's black population reached its 20th-century 
peak at approximately 47% of the overall city population. The 6.9 Mw Loma 
Prieta earthquake occurred on October 17, 1989. The rupture was related 
to the San Andreas fault system and affected the entire San Francisco Bay 
Area with a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). Many structures 
in Oakland were badly damaged including the double-decker portion of Interstate 
880 that collapsed. The eastern span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge 
also sustained damage and was closed to traffic for one month. On October 
20, 1991, a massive firestorm swept down from the Berkeley/Oakland hills 
above the Caldecott Tunnel. Twenty-five people were killed, 150 people 
were injured, and nearly 4,000 homes destroyed. With the loss of life and 
an estimated economic loss of US$1.5 billion, this was the worst urban 
firestorm in American history.[41][42] During the mid-1990s, Oakland's 
economy began to recover as it transitioned to new types of jobs. In addition, 
the city participated in large development and urban renewal projects, 
concentrated especially in the downtown area, at the Port of Oakland, and 
at the Oakland International Airport.[43] After his 1999 inauguration, 
Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown continued his predecessor Elihu Harris' public 
policy of supporting downtown housing development in the area defined as 
the Central Business District in Oakland's 1998 General Plan.[44] Brown's 
plan and other redevelopment projects were controversial due to potential 
rent increases and gentrification, which would displace lower-income residents 
from downtown Oakland into outlying neighborhoods and cities.[45] The economic 
crises in 2001 and 2008 hampered Oakland's recovery as these downturns 
resulted in lowered sales, rentals and occupancy of the new housing, and 
slower growth and economic recovery than expected. Due to allegations of 
misconduct by the Oakland Police Department, the City of Oakland has paid 
claims for a total of US$57 million during the 2001–2011 timeframe to plaintiffs 
claiming police abuse; this is the largest sum paid by any city in California.[46] 
On October 10, 2011, protesters and civic activists began "Occupy Oakland" 
demonstrations at Frank Ogawa Plaza in Downtown Oakland.[47][48] Oakland 
is in the eastern region of the San Francisco Bay. In 1991 the City Hall 
tower was at 37°48′19″N 122°16′21″W﻿ / ﻿37.805302°N 122.272539°W﻿ / 37.805302; 
-122.272539 (NAD83). (The building still exists, but like the rest of the 
Bay Area, it has shifted northwest perhaps 0.6 meters in the last twenty 
years.) The United States Census Bureau says the city's total area is 78.0 
square miles (202 km2), including 55.8 square miles (145 km2) of land and 
22.2 square miles (57 km2) (28.48 percent) of water. Oakland's highest 
point is near Grizzly Peak Blvd, east of Berkeley, just over 1,760 feet 
(540 m) above sea level at about 37°52′43″N 122°13′27″W﻿ / ﻿37.8786°N 122.2241°W﻿ 
/ 37.8786; -122.2241. Oakland has 19 miles (31 km) of shoreline,[49] but 
Radio Beach is the only beach in Oakland. Oaklanders refer to their city's 
terrain as "the flatlands" and "the hills". Until recent waves of gentrification, 
these terms also symbolized Oakland's deep economic divide, with "the hills" 
being more affluent communities. About two-thirds of Oakland lies in the 
flat plain of the East Bay, with one-third rising into the foothills and 
hills of the East Bay range. Ruptures along the nearby San Andreas fault 
caused severe earth movement in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1906 and 
1989. San Andreas quakes induces creep (movement occurring on earthquake 
faults) in the Hayward fault, which runs directly through Oakland, Berkeley, 
San Jose and other Bay Area cities.[50] Oakland has more than 50 distinct 
neighborhoods. The greater divisions in the city include downtown Oakland 
and its greater Central Business District, Lake Merritt, East Oakland, 
North Oakland, West Oakland, and the Oakland Hills. East Oakland, which 
includes the East Oakland Hills, encompasses more than half of Oakland's 
land area, stretching from Lakeshore Avenue on the east shore of Lake Merritt 
southeast to the San Leandro border. North Oakland encompasses the neighborhoods 
between downtown and Berkeley and Emeryville. West Oakland is the area 
between downtown and the Bay, partially surrounded by the Oakland Point, 
and encompassing the Port of Oakland. In 2011, Oakland was ranked the 10th 
most walkable city in the United States.[51] Lake Merritt, an urban estuary 
near downtown, is a mix of fresh and salt water draining in and out from 
the Oakland Harbor at the San Francisco Bay and one of Oakland's most notable 
features.[52] It was designated the United States' first official wildlife 
refuge in 1870.[53] Originally a marsh-lined wildlife haven, Lake Merritt 
was dredged and bordered with parks from the 1890s to the 1910s. Despite 
this reduction in habitat, Oakland is home to a number of rare and endangered 
species, many of which are localized to serpentine soils and bedrock. Lake 
Merritt is surrounded by residential and business districts, including 
downtown and Grand Lake. The city of Piedmont, incorporated in Oakland's 
central foothills after the 1906 earthquake, is a small independent city 
surrounded by the city of Oakland. Oakland has a Mediterranean climate 
with an average of 260 sunny days per year. Lake Merritt, a large estuary 
centrally located east of Downtown, was designated as the United States' 
first official wildlife refuge. Based on data gathered by the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oakland is ranked No. 1 in climate 
among U.S. cities.[54] Oakland's climate is typified by the temperate and 
seasonal Mediterranean climate. Summers are usually dry and warm and winters 
are mild and damp. It has features found in both nearby coastal cities 
such as San Francisco and inland cities such as San Jose, making it warmer 
than San Francisco and cooler than San Jose. Its position on San Francisco 
Bay across from the Bay Bridge means that the Northern part of the city 
can have cooling maritime fog. It is far enough inland that the fog often 
burns off by midday, allowing it to have typically sunny California days. 
The hills tend to have more fog than the flatlands, as the fog drifts down 
from Berkeley. The U.S. Weather Bureau kept weather records in downtown 
Oakland from October 4, 1894, to July 31, 1958. During that time, the record 
high temperature was 104 °F (40 °C) on June 24, 1957, and the record low 
temperature was 24 °F (−4 °C) on January 23, 1949. Dry, warm offshore "Diablo" 
winds (similar to the Santa Ana winds of Southern California) sometimes 
occur, especially in fall, and raise the fire danger. In 1991, such an 
episode allowed the catastrophic Oakland Hills fire to spread and consume 
many homes. The wettest year was 1940 with 38.65 inches (982 mm) and the 
driest year was 1910 with 12.02 inches (305 mm). The most rainfall in one 
month was 15.35 inches (390 mm) in January 1911. The most rainfall in 24 
hours was 4.27 inches (108 mm) on February 12, 1904.[55] Rainfall near 
the bayfront is only 23 inches (580 mm), but is higher in the Oakland Hills 
to the east (up to 30 inches [760 mm]). The higher rainfall in the hills 
supports woods of oak, madrona, pine, fir and a few redwood groves in the 
wetter areas. Before being logged in the 19th century, some of the tallest 
redwood trees in California (used for navigation by ships entering the 
Golden Gate) may have stood in the Oakland Hills. One old stump 30 feet 
(9.1 m) in diameter can be seen near Redwood Regional Park. Sunny, drier 
slopes are grassy or covered in scattered oaks and chaparral brush. Australian 
eucalyptus trees have been extensively planted in many areas, as they come 
from a similar climate. The National Weather Service today has two official 
weather stations in Oakland: Oakland International Airport and the Oakland 
Museum (established 1970). In 1991, an urban conflagration, the Oakland 
Hills Fire, destroyed nearly 4,000 homes and killed twenty-five people 
in the Oakland hills range; it was the worst urban firestorm in American 
history.[41] The 2010 United States Census[63] reported that Oakland had 
a population of 390,724. The population density was 5,009.2 inhabitants 
per square mile (1,934.1/km2). The racial makeup of Oakland was 134,925 
(34.5%) White (non-Hispanic White 25.9%), 129,471 (34.0%) African American, 
3,040 (0.8%) Native American, 65,811 (16.8%) Asian (8.7% Chinese, 2.2% 
Vietnamese, 1.6% Filipino, 0.7% Cambodian, 0.7% Laotian, 0.6% Korean, 0.5% 
Japanese, 0.5% Indian, 0.1% Mongolian), 2,222 (0.6%) Pacific Islander (0.3% 
Tongan), 53,378 (13.7%) from other races, and 21,877 (5.6%) from two or 
more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 99,068 persons (25.4%). 
18.1% of the population were of Mexican descent, 1.9% Salvadoran, 1.3% 
Guatemalan, and 0.7% Puerto Rican. Oakland has the fifth largest cluster 
of "elite zip codes" ranked by the number of households with the highest 
combination of income and education.[65] 37.9% of residents over 25 years 
of age have bachelor's degree or higher.[66] Oakland ranked among the top 
cities with residents with bachelor's degrees and graduate degrees per 
square mile.[67] Oakland ranks in the top 20 of American cities in median 
household income, with a 2012 value of US$51,863.[68] In 2012, the median 
income for a household in the city was US$51,863 and the median income 
for a family was US$59,459. The mean income for a household was US$77,888 
and the mean income for a family was US$90,948. Males had a median income 
of US$50,140 versus US$50,304 for females.[69] The unemployment rate as 
of December 2013 was 9.7%.[70] In 2007 approximately 15.3 percent of families 
and 17.0 percent of the general population were below the poverty line, 
including 27.9 percent of those under age 18 and 13.1 percent of those 
age 65 or over. 0.7% of the population is homeless.[71] Home ownership 
is 41%[71] and 14% of rental units are subsidized.[71] As of the census[72] 
of 2000, 19.4% of the population and 16.2% of families were below the poverty 
line. Out of the total population, 27.9% of those under the age of 18 and 
13.1% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line. The census 
reported that 382,586 people (97.9% of the population) lived in households, 
5,675 (1.5%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 2,463 (0.6%) 
were institutionalized. There were 153,791 households, out of which 44,762 
(29.1%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 50,797 (33.0%) 
were opposite-sex married couples living together, 24,122 (15.7%) had a 
female householder with no husband present, 8,799 (5.7%) had a male householder 
with no wife present. There were 11,289 (7.3%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, 
and 3,442 (2.2%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 52,103 households 
(33.9%) were made up of individuals and 13,778 (9.0%) had someone living 
alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 
2.49. There were 83,718 families (54.4% of all households); the average 
family size was 3.27. The population was spread out with 83,120 people 
(21.3%) under the age of 18, 36,272 people (9.3%) aged 18 to 24, 129,139 
people (33.1%) aged 25 to 44, 98,634 people (25.2%) aged 45 to 64, and 
43,559 people (11.1%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age 
was 36.2 years. For every 100 females there were 94.2 males. For every 
100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.8 males. There were 169,710 
housing units at an average density of 2,175.7 per square mile (840.0/km2), 
of which 63,142 (41.1%) were owner-occupied, and 90,649 (58.9%) were occupied 
by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 3.0%; the rental vacancy rate 
was 8.5%. 166,662 people (42.7% of the population) lived in owner-occupied 
housing units and 215,924 people (55.3%) lived in rental housing units. 
Oakland is one of the most ethnically diverse major cities in the country.[73][74] 
Oakland was ranked the fourth most diverse city in America, with an overall 
diversity score of 91.4.[75] The city's formerly most populous ethnic group, 
whites, declined from 95.3% in 1940 to 32.5% by 1990, due to a combination 
of factors, such as suburbanization. Oakland became a destination for African 
Americans in the Great Migration during and after World War II as they 
gained high-paying jobs in the defense industry. Since the 1960s, Oakland 
has been known as a center of Northern California's African-American community. 
Between 2000 and 2010 Oakland's black population decreased by nearly 25 
percent.[76] The city's demographics have changed due to a combination 
of rising housing prices associated with gentrification and with blacks 
relocating to better housing in Bay Area suburbs or moving to the Southern 
United States in a reverse migration, where conditions are considered to 
have improved.[77][78][79] Blacks have formed a strong plurality in Oakland 
for many years, peaking in 1980 at about 47% of the population. In the 
2010 census African Americans maintained their status as Oakland's single 
largest ethnic group, with 27% of the population, followed by non-Hispanic 
whites at 25.9%, and Hispanics of any race at 25.4%.[80] Ethnic Asians 
constitute 17%, followed by smaller minority groups. Recent trends and 
cultural shifts have led to a decline among some of Oakland's longstanding 
black institutions, such as churches, businesses and nightclubs, which 
had developed during the growing years of the 1950s through 1970.[81] Some 
long-time black residents have been dismayed at the population changes. 
Many immigrants have settled in the city. In recent years, immigrants and 
others have marched by the thousands down Oakland's International Boulevard 
in support of legal reforms benefiting illegal immigrants.[82] An analysis 
by the Urban Institute of U.S. Census 2000 numbers showed that Oakland 
had the third-highest concentration of gays and lesbians among the 50 largest 
U.S. cities, behind San Francisco and Seattle. Census data showed that, 
among incorporated places that have at least 500 female couples, Oakland 
had the nation's largest proportion. In the 2000 census, 2,650 lesbian 
couples identified as such in Oakland; one in every 41 Oakland couples 
identified as a same-sex female partnership.[83][84] Oakland is a major 
West Coast port, and the fifth busiest in the United States by cargo volume.[85] 
The Port of Oakland handles 99% of all containerized goods moving through 
Northern California, representing $41 billion worth of international trade.[86][87] 
There are nearly 200,000 jobs related to marine cargo transport in the 
Oakland area.[88] These jobs range from minimum wage hourly positions to 
Transportation Storage and Distribution Managers who earn an annual average 
salary of US$91,520.[89] The Port of Oakland was an early innovator/pioneer 
in the technologies of Intermodal Containerized Shipping. The city is also 
home to several major corporations including Kaiser Permanente, Clorox, 
and Dreyer's ice cream, and retailer Cost Plus World Markets.[90] Tech 
companies such as Ask.com and Pandora Radio are located in Oakland,[91] 
and in recent years many start-up high tech and green energy companies 
have found a home in the downtown neighborhoods of Uptown, City Center, 
Jack London Square and Lake Merritt Financial District.[92] In 2014, Oakland 
was the fifth ranked city for tech entrepreneurs by total venture capital 
investment.[93] As of 2013[update], the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward metropolitan 
area has a GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of US$360.4 billion, ranking eighth 
among metropolitan areas in the United States.[94] In 2014, Oakland was 
amongst the best cities to start a career, the highest ranked city in California 
after San Francisco. Additionally, Oakland ranked fourth in cities with 
professional opportunities.[95] Numerous companies in San Francisco continue 
to expand in or migrate over to Oakland.[96] Oakland experienced an increase 
of both its population and of land values in the early-to-mid first decade 
of the 21st century. The 10k Plan, which began during former mayor Elihu 
Harris' administration, and intensified during former mayor Jerry Brown's 
administration resulted in several thousand units of new multi-family housing 
and development. As of 2015[update], the top employers in the city were:[97] 
In 2013, over 2.5 million people visited Oakland, injecting US$1.3 billion 
into the economy.[98] Oakland has been experiencing an increase in hotel 
demand. Occupancy is 74%, while RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) increased 
by 14%, the highest increase of any big city in the western region of the 
United States.[99] Both Oakland and San Francisco were forecasted to experience 
the highest increases in ADR (Average daily rate).[100] In recent years, 
Oakland has gained national recognition as a travel destination. In 2012, 
Oakland was named the top North American city to visit, highlighting its 
growing number of sophisticated restaurants and bars, top music venues, 
and increasing nightlife appeal.[101] Oakland also took the No. 16 spot 
in "America's Coolest Cities," ranked by metrics like entertainment options 
and recreational opportunities per capita, etc.[102] In 2013, Oakland topped 
the No. 1 spot in "America's Most Exciting Cities," notably having the 
most movie theaters, theater companies, and museums per square mile.[103] 
In "America's Most Hipster Cities," Oakland took the number-5 spot, cited 
for luring San Francisco "hippies" into the city.[104] Oakland has also 
increased its travel destination allure internationally.[105] Oakland has 
a significant art scene and claims the highest concentration of artists 
per capita in the United States.[106] In 2013, Oakland was designated as 
one of America's top twelve art communities, recognizing Downtown (including 
Uptown), Chinatown, Old Oakland, and Jack London Square as communities 
"that have most successfully combined art, artists and venues for creativity 
and expression with independent businesses, retail shops and restaurants, 
and a walkable lifestyle to make vibrant neighborhoods." [107] Galleries 
exist in various parts of Oakland, with the newest additions centered mostly 
in the Uptown area. Oakland ranked 11th in cities for designers and artists.[108] 
The city is a renowned culinary hotbed,offering both a wide variety and 
innovative approaches cuisine in restaurants and markets, often featuring 
locally grown produce and international foods such as French, Italian, 
Iberian, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, African-Caribbean, Southern/French African-Americanan 
fusion, etc. that reflect the city's ethnically diverse population. Historically 
a focal point of the West Coast blues and jazz scenes, Oakland is also 
home to musicians representing such genres as rhythm and blues, gospel, 
funk, punk, heavy metal, Rap/Gangsta rap, and hip hop. Downtown Oakland 
has an assortment of bars and nightclubs. They include dive bars, dance 
clubs, modern lounges and jazz bars. The Paramount Theater features headlining 
musical tours and productions, while Fox Oakland Theatre draws various 
musical genres including jam bands, rock, punk, blues, jazz, and reggae. 
The Paramount and Fox theaters often book simultaneous events, creating 
busy nights uptown.[109] In 2012, Oakland was dubbed a "New Sin City", 
following its 2010 decision to relax its cabaret laws, which gave a boost 
to its nightclub and bar scene.[110] Recent years have seen the growth 
of the Oakland Art Murmur event, occurring in the Uptown neighborhood the 
first Friday evening of every month.[111] The event attracts around 20,000 
people along twenty city blocks, featuring live performances, food trucks, 
and over 30 galleries and venues.[112][113] Gertrude Stein wrote about 
Oakland in her 1937 book Everybody's Autobiography: "There is no there 
there," Stein wrote on learning that the neighborhood where she lived as 
a child had been torn down to make way for an industrial park. The quote 
is sometimes misconstrued to refer to Oakland as a whole.[114][115] Modern-day 
Oakland has turned the quote on its head, with a statue downtown titled 
"There." In 2005 a sculpture called HERETHERE was installed by the City 
of Berkeley on the Berkeley-Oakland border at Martin Luther King Jr. Way. 
The sculpture consists of eight-foot-tall letters spelling "HERE" and "THERE" 
in front of the BART tracks as they descend from their elevated section 
in Oakland to the subway through Berkeley.[116] Oakland has teams in three 
professional sports: Baseball, basketball, and football. The Oakland Athletics 
MLB club won three consecutive World Series championships in 1972, 1973, 
and 1974, and appeared in another three consecutive World Series from 1988 
to 1990, winning their fourth championship in 1989. The Golden State Warriors 
won the 1974–1975 NBA championship and the 2014–2015 NBA championship. 
The Oakland Raiders of the NFL won Super Bowl XI in 1977 and Super Bowl 
XV in 1981, while also appearing in Super Bowl II in 1968 and Super Bowl 
XXXVII in 2003. The Raiders left Oakland for Los Angeles in 1982, where 
they won a third Super Bowl championship, and returned to Oakland in 1995. 
The Warriors announced in April 2014 that they will leave Oakland once 
their new arena is built across the Bay in San Francisco, while the Raiders 
are in discussion with city officials about building a new football-only 
stadium. Oakland's former sports teams include: Oakland has many parks 
and recreation centers which total 5,937 acres (2,403 ha). In its 2013 
ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land, a national land conservation 
organization, reported that Oakland had the 18th best park system among 
the 50 most populous U.S. cities.[117] In 2013, Oakland ranked 4th among 
American cities as an urban destination for nature lovers.[118] Some of 
the city's most notable parks include: Additionally, the following seven 
East Bay Regional Parks are located entirely or partially in the city of 
Oakland: Major places of worship in Oakland include: Oakland City Church, 
First Congregational Church of Oakland, Evangelistic Outreach Center, Green 
Pastures, the Presbyterian, First Presbyterian Church of Oakland; Greek 
Orthodox Ascension Cathedral; the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Christ the 
Light; the United Methodist Chinese Community Church; the Unitarian First 
Unitarian Church; the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints' Oakland 
California Temple; the Muslim, 31st Street Islamic Center, Light-House 
Mosque; the Reform Jewish Temple Sinai; the Conservative Jewish, Temple 
Beth Abraham; Allen Temple Baptist Church; and the Orthodox Jewish, Beth 
Jacob Congregation, American Baptist; Faith Baptist Church of Oakland, 
St. Paul Lutheran, His Gospel Christian Fellowship, six Kingdom Halls of 
Jehovah's Witnesses and St. Vartan Armenian Apostolic Church. Oakland has 
a mayor-council government. The mayor is elected at-large for a four-year 
term. The Oakland City Council has eight council members representing seven 
districts in Oakland with one member elected at-large and others from single-member 
districts; council members serve staggered four-year terms. The mayor appoints 
a city administrator, subject to the confirmation by the City Council, 
who is the chief administrative officer of the city. Other city officers 
include: city attorney (elected), city auditor (elected), and city clerk 
(appointed by city administrator).[120] Oakland's mayor is limited to two 
terms. There are no term limits for the city council. Council member Larry 
Reid, also serving as vice-mayor, was elected to a fifth term in November 
2012.[121] Oakland City Hall was evacuated after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake 
until US$80M seismic retrofit and hazard abatement work was complete in 
1995.[122] City offices had to be housed in leased space and other locations. 
Jean Quan was elected mayor in November 2010, beating Don Perata and Rebecca 
Kaplan in the city's first ranked choice balloting.[123] This new system 
is intended to increase voters' ability to choose preferred candidates, 
as they can combine ranked votes when several candidates are competing. 
Oakland is also part of Alameda County, for which the Government of Alameda 
County is defined and authorized under the California Constitution, California 
law, and the Charter of the County of Alameda.[124] The County government 
provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, 
law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, 
public health, and social services. The County government is primarily 
composed of the elected five-member Board of Supervisors, other elected 
offices including the Sheriff/Coroner, the District Attorney, Assessor, 
Auditor-Controller/County Clerk/Recorder, and Treasurer/Tax Collector, 
and numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the 
County Administrator. In the California State Legislature, Oakland is in 
the 9th Senate District, represented by Democrat Loni Hancock,[8] and is 
split between the 15th and 18th Assembly districts, represented by Tony 
Thurmond and Rob Bonta, respectively.[9] In the United States House of 
Representatives, Oakland is in California's 13th congressional district, 
represented by Democrat Barbara Lee.[10] Oakland was politically conservative 
from the 1860s to the 1950s, with positions expressed by the Republican-oriented 
Oakland Tribune newspaper. At the time, the Republican Party was more moderate 
than it has become in the 21st century, and some members belonged to a 
progressive tradition across the Northern Tier of states. In the 1950s 
and '60s, the majority of voters began to favor liberal policies and the 
Democratic Party.[125][126] Oakland has the highest percentage of registered 
Democrats of any of the incorporated cities in Alameda County, with Berkeley 
coming in a close second. As of 2009[update], Oakland has 204,646 registered 
voters. 140,858 (68.8%) are registered Democrats, 12,248 (5.9%) are registered 
Republicans, 10,431 (5.2%) are members of other parties and 41,109 (20.1%) 
decline to state a political affiliation.[127] Oakland is widely regarded 
as being one of the most liberal major cities in the nation. The Cook Partisan 
Voting Index of Congressional District 13, which includes Oakland and Berkeley, 
is D+37, making it the most Democratic congressional district in California 
and the fourth most Democratic district in the US.[128] While progress 
has been made in reducing the city's historically high property crime rate, 
violent crime has remained a persistent problem in Oakland, primarily concentrated 
in certain poor minority neighborhoods. There were 93 homicides in 2015, 
seven more than in 2014.[129] Oakland's crime rate began to escalate during 
the late 1960s, and by the end of the 1970s, during the drug wars, the 
city's per capita murder rate had risen to twice that of San Francisco 
or New York City.[130] The rise in crime may have been an effect of the 
different method that was used to deal with rebellious youth. Prior to 
1960, there were successful government funded social programs, where workers 
would work in neighborhoods searching for rebellious teens to enter them 
in youth centers that would be able to teach them proper values and improve 
their behavior.[131] But by the late 1960s, the police and Federal Bureau 
of Investigation(FBI) used military tactics to manage unwanted behavior, 
with increases in arrests, prosecutions, and imprisonment.[131] During 
the first decade of the 21st century, Oakland has consistently been listed 
as one of the most dangerous large cities in the United States,[132] but 
in the latter part of the decade, the homicide rate dropped four years 
in a row, and violent crime in general had dropped 27%. During 2011 there 
were increases in both categories.[133] In 2012 Oakland reported 131 homicides, 
the highest since 2006 (when there were 148 recorded).[134][135] Since 
then there have been continued decreases: In 2013, there was a 33% decrease 
in homicides, allowing Oakland to record its lowest homicide count since 
2004. Aggravated assaults were down 10% and rapes declined by 27%, reaching 
its lowest level in eight years.[136][137] In the first quarter of 2014, 
homicides, aggravated assaults, and burglaries were down 15% relative to 
2013. Additionally, shootings were down 31% and robberies were down 36%.[138] 
Oakland's police force has dropped to 612 officers, down from more than 
800 in 2009. It is below the 925 recommended by the city's strategic plan. 
The city has recently started to rebuild its force and recently graduated 
34 officers.[134] The Oakland Police Department is committed to improved 
public safety by increasing police presence during peak crime hours, improving 
intelligence gathering, and moving more aggressively to arrest violent 
crime suspects.[139][140] Among Oakland's 35 police patrol beats, violent 
crime remains a serious problem in specific East and West Oakland neighborhoods. 
In 2008, homicides were concentrated: 72% occurred in three City Council 
districts, District 3 in West Oakland and Districts 6 and 7 in East Oakland, 
although these districts have 44% of Oakland's residents.[141] In 2012, 
Oakland implemented Operation Ceasefire, a gang violence reduction plan 
used in other cities, based in part on the research and strategies of author 
David M. Kennedy.[142][143][144][145] Most public schools in Oakland are 
operated by the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD), which covers the 
city except for Sheffield Village. Due to financial troubles and administrative 
failures, it was in receivership by the state of California from 2002 to 
2008.[146] As of 2015[update] the Oakland Unified School District includes 
86 division-run schools and 32 charter schools; the district also manages 
several adult education programs. As of 2015[update] there are 48,181 total 
K–12 students; among division-run schools, there are 4,600 plus employees.[147] 
OUSD test scores historically lag behind the rest of California, in particular 
due to a high proportion of English-language learners.[148] Some individual 
schools have much better performance than the citywide average. As of 2013[update], 
for example, over half the students at Hillcrest Elementary School in the 
Montclair upper hills neighborhood performed at the "advanced" level in 
the English portion of the test, and students at Lincoln Elementary School 
in the Chinatown neighborhood performed at the "advanced" level in the 
math portion.[149] Oakland's three largest public high schools are Oakland 
High School, Oakland Technical High School, and Skyline High School. There 
are also numerous small public high schools within Castlemont Community 
of Small Schools, Fremont Federation of High Schools, and McClymonds Educational 
Complex, all of which were once single, larger public high schools that 
were reorganized due to poor performance (Castlemont High School, Fremont 
High School, and McClymonds High School, respectively). Among charter schools 
in the district, North Oakland Community Charter School (NOCCS), an elementary 
and middle school, is one of the few public progressive schools in the 
country.[clarification needed] Other charter schools include the Oakland 
Military Institute, Oakland School for the Arts, Bay Area Technology School, 
and Oakland Charter Academy.[150] There are several private high schools 
including the secular The College Preparatory School and Head-Royce School, 
and the Catholic Bishop O'Dowd High School, Holy Names High School and 
St. Elizabeth High School. Catholic schools in Oakland are operated by 
the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oakland also include eight K–8 schools (plus 
one in Piedmont on the Oakland city border). Northern Light School is a 
private nonprofit elementary and middle school. Bentley School is an Independent 
Co-educational K–12, college preparatory school, located on two campuses 
in Oakland and Lafayette, California. Accredited colleges and universities 
include: In 2001, the SFSU Oakland Multimedia Center was opened, allowing 
San Francisco State University to conduct classes near downtown Oakland.[151] 
The Oakland Higher Education Consortium and the City of Oakland's Community 
and Economic Development Agency (CEDA) opened the Oakland Higher Education 
Center downtown in 2002 to provide "access to multiple higher education 
service providers within a shared urban facility." Member schools include 
primary user California State University, East Bay as well as Lincoln University, 
New College of California, Saint Mary's College of California, SFSU Multimedia 
Studies Program, UC Berkeley Extension, University of Phoenix and Peralta 
Community College District.[152][153] Oakland is served by major television 
stations broadcasting primarily out of San Francisco and San Jose. The 
region's Fox O&O, KTVU, is based in (and licensed to) Oakland at Jack London 
Square along with co-owned independent station KICU-TV (licensed to San 
Jose). In addition, the city is served by various AM and FM radio stations 
as well; AM stations KKSF, KMKY, KNEW and KQKE are licensed to Oakland. 
Oakland was served by the Oakland Tribune, which published its first newspaper 
on February 21, 1874. The Tribune Tower, which features a large clock, 
is an Oakland landmark. At key times throughout the day (8:00 am, noon 
and 5:00 pm), the clock tower carillon plays a variety of classic melodies, 
which change daily. In 2007, the Oakland Tribune moved its offices from 
the tower to an East Oakland location, before folding in 2011.[154] The 
East Bay Express, a locally owned free weekly paper, is based in Jack London 
Square and distributed throughout the East Bay. Oaklandwiki is a thriving 
(mostly) English-language LocalWiki. Oakland residents have access to the 
three major airports of the San Francisco Bay Area: Oakland International 
Airport, San Francisco International Airport, and San Jose International 
Airport. Oakland International Airport, located within the city limits 
of Oakland, is 4 mi (6.4 km) south of downtown Oakland and serves domestic 
and international destinations. AC Transit provides 24-hour service to 
the airport, and the Coliseum–Oakland International Airport line automated 
guideway transit provides frequent service between the airport and BART's 
Oakland Coliseum Station. The city has regional and long distance passenger 
train service provided by Amtrak, with stations located near Jack London 
Square and the Oakland Coliseum. Amtrak's California Zephyr has its western 
terminus at the nearby Emeryville station. Historically, the city was served 
by several train companies, which terminated in different terminals. Santa 
Fe trains terminated at the 40th and San Pablo station. Southern Pacific 
trains ended at the 16th Street Station.[155] Western Pacific trains ended 
at the 3rd and Washington station. However, a common feature was that the 
different railroads continued one more stop to a station at Oakland Pier.[156] 
From this latter point passengers would ride ferries to San Francisco. 
The most recent census data compiled in 2007 before gasoline price spikes 
in 2008, show 24.3 percent of Oaklanders used public transportation, walked 
or used "other means" to commute to work, not including telecommuting,[157] 
with 17 percent of Oakland households being "car free" and or statistically 
categorized as having "no vehicles available."[158] Bus transit service 
in Oakland and the inner East Bay is provided by the Alameda and Contra 
Costa Transit District, AC Transit. The district originated in 1958 after 
the conspiratorial dissolution of the Key System of streetcars. Many AC 
Transit lines follow old routes of the Key System.[34] Intercity bus companies 
that serve Oakland include Greyhound, BoltBus, Megabus, USAsia, and Hoang 
Transportation.[159] The metropolitan area is served by Bay Area Rapid 
Transit (BART) from eight stations in Oakland. The system has headquarters 
in Oakland, with major transfer hubs at MacArthur and 19th Street stations. 
BART's headquarters was located in a building above the Lake Merritt BART 
station until 2006, when it relocated to the Kaiser Center due to seismic 
safety concerns. The Alameda / Oakland Ferry operates ferry service from 
Jack London Square to Alameda, San Francisco, and Angel Island. Oakland 
licenses taxi cabs, and has zoned cab stands in its downtown, including 
a bicycle pedi-cab service. The Oakland City Council adopted a Bicycle 
Master Plan in 1999 as a part of the Land Use and Transportation (LUTE) 
element of Oakland's 1998 General Plan. In addition, the Oakland City Council 
reaffirmed the bike plan in 2005 and 2007. Several miles of bike lanes 
were created as a result of the plan, with more awaiting funding.[citation 
needed] Facilities for parking thousands of bicycles have been installed 
downtown and in other commercial districts throughout Oakland.[citation 
needed] According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2011 American Community Survey, 
Oakland moved into 7th place in the nation by percentage of people that 
choose to commute by bike in 2011.[160] Oakland is served by several major 
highways: Eastbound Bay Bridge traffic entering Oakland then splits into 
three freeways at the MacArthur Maze freeway interchange: Interstate 580 
(MacArthur Freeway) heads southeast toward Hayward and eventually to the 
California Central Valley; Interstate 880 (Nimitz Freeway) runs south to 
San Jose; and the Eastshore Freeway (Interstate 80/I-580) runs north, providing 
connections to Sacramento and San Rafael, respectively. Interstate 980 
(Williams Freeway) begins its eastbound journey at I-880 in Downtown Oakland 
before turning into State Route 24 (Grove Shafter Freeway) at I-580. State 
Route 13 begins as the Warren Freeway at I-580, and runs through a scenic 
valley in the Montclair District before entering Berkeley. A stub of a 
planned freeway was constructed at the High Street exit from the Nimitz 
Freeway, but that freeway extension plan was abandoned. At the time of 
the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the Cypress Street Viaduct double-deck 
segment of the Nimitz Freeway collapsed, killing 42 people. The old freeway 
segment had passed through the middle of West Oakland, forming a barrier 
between West Oakland neighborhoods. Following the earthquake, this section 
was rerouted around the perimeter of West Oakland and rebuilt in 1999. 
The east span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge also suffered damage 
from the quake when a 50-foot (15-m) section of the upper deck collapsed 
onto the lower deck; the damaged section was repaired within a month of 
the earthquake. As a result of Loma Prieta, a significant seismic retrofit 
was performed on the western span of the Bay Bridge. The eastern span has 
now been replaced with a dramatic single-tower self-anchoring suspension 
span. Two underwater tunnels, the Webster and Posey Tubes, connect the 
main island of Alameda to downtown Oakland, coming above ground in Chinatown. 
In addition, the Park Street, Fruitvale, and High Street bridges connect 
Alameda to East Oakland over the Oakland Estuary. In the hills, the Leimert 
Bridge crosses Dimond Canyon, connecting the Oakmore neighborhood to Park 
Boulevard. The Caldecott Tunnel carries Highway 24 through the Berkeley 
Hills, connecting central Contra Costa County to Oakland. The Caldecott 
has four bores. Freight service, which consists primarily of moving shipping 
containers to and from the Port of Oakland, is provided today by Union 
Pacific Railroad (UP), and to a lesser extent by BNSF Railway (which now 
shares the tracks of the UP between Richmond and Oakland). Historically, 
Oakland was served by several railroads. Besides the transcontinental line 
of the Southern Pacific, there was also the Santa Fe (whose Oakland terminal 
was actually in Emeryville), the Western Pacific Railroad (who built a 
pier adjacent to the SP's), and the Sacramento Northern Railroad (eventually 
absorbed by the Western Pacific, which in turn was absorbed by UP in 1983). 
As one of the three major ports on the West Coast of the United States, 
the Port of Oakland is the largest seaport on San Francisco Bay and the 
fifth busiest container port in the United States. It was one of the earliest 
seaports to switch to containerization and to intermodal container transfer,[161] 
thereby displacing the Port of San Francisco, which never modernized its 
waterfront. One of the earlier limitations to growth was the inability 
to transfer containers to rail lines, all cranes historically operating 
between ocean vessels and trucks. In the 1980s the Port of Oakland began 
the evaluation of development of an intermodal container transfer capability, 
i.e. facilities that now allow trans-loading of containers from vessels 
to either trucks or rail modes.[citation needed] Water and sewage treatment 
are provided by East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD). Pacific Gas 
and Electric Company (PG & E) provides natural gas and electricity service. 
Municipal garbage collection is franchised to Waste Management, Inc. Telecommunications 
and subscriber television services are provided by multiple private corporations 
and other service providers in accordance with the competitive objectives 
of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Oakland tops the list of the 50 
largest US cities using electricity from renewable sources.[162] Originating 
in Oakland, Kaiser Permanente, is an HMO started in 1942, during World 
War II, by industrialist Henry J. Kaiser to provide medical care for Kaiser 
Shipyards workers. It is the largest managed care organization in the United 
States and the largest non-governmental health care provider in the world.[163] 
It is headquartered at 1950 Franklin Street in Downtown Oakland and maintains 
a large medical center in the Piedmont Avenue neighborhood. Alta Bates 
Summit Medical Center, an East Bay hospital system, maintains its Summit 
Campus in the neighborhood known as "Pill Hill" north of downtown. Until 
2000, it was the Summit Medical Center before merging with Berkeley-based 
Alta Bates. All campuses now operate under the Sutter Health network. Alameda 
County Medical Center is operated by the county and provides medical services 
to county residents, including the medically indigent who do not have health 
insurance. The main campus, Highland Hospital in East Oakland, is the trauma 
center for the northern area of the East Bay. Children's Hospital Oakland 
is the primary medical center specializing in pediatrics in the East Bay. 
It is a designated Level I pediatric trauma center, and the only independent 
children's hospital in Northern California. Oakland has 12 sister cities:[164]
