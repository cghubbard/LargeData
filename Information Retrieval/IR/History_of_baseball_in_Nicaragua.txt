Baseball is the national game of Nicaragua, and is one of the most popular 
sports in the country.[1] Nicaragua has a professional baseball league, 
the Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League, consisting of four teams. 
The national baseball team has been successful in the past, mainly throughout 
the 1970s.[1] In many pick-up games, players have to improvise due to lack 
of equipment.[2] Often, grapefruits, and rocks are used as baseballs.[2] 
Nicaragua and near-by Panama are two countries who have baseball as their 
national sport, rather than soccer, the national sport of many Central 
American countries.[3] Baseball was introduced in the 1880s by Albert Addlesberg, 
an American businessman living in Bluefields.[4] During this time, the 
area around Bluefields was known as the autonomous Mosquito Reserve and 
a strong British influence in the area was evidenced by the popularity 
of cricket. Addlesberg convinced two of the most popular cricket clubs 
to switch to baseball and supplied the locals with equipment he imported 
from New Orleans.[4] Two teams were created in 1887, the Southern and Four 
Roses.[3][4] They began to play in 1888 and baseball has been played on 
the Mosquito Coast almost continuously since that time, but the entire 
region has long since been incorporated into the Republic of Nicaragua. 
The first 'official' game took place in 1891 between Managua and Granada.[3][4] 
Carter Donaldson, who was the U.S. Consul in Nicaragua at the time, founded 
the first continuous team in 1904.[4] United States Marines stationed in 
Nicaragua in the early part of the 20th century were also credited for 
bringing the sport to the country, and popularizing it in the area.[2][3][5] 
Professional baseball came to an end in Nicaragua in 1967, after years 
of political and economic problems.[1] In the 1970s, however, baseball 
again became popular after the success of the Nicaragua national baseball 
team.[1] "After all, to say Nicaraguans are baseball-crazy seems ludicrously 
inadequate. The game is part of the air people breathe; the crack of the 
bat permeates hot, tropical nights; it moves up from the barrios; the game 
even peppers the language with borrowed English expressions, like 'play 
ball,' and 'home run,' used in a colloquial sense." In the 1980s, popularity 
of baseball in the country began to decline.[7] After the Nicaraguan civil 
war, baseball began to flourish again.[8] The policy of Nicaraguan professional 
baseball before the 1990s was to discourage the recruitment of Nicaraguan 
players by Major League Baseball scouts.[7] On August 6, 1990, the San 
Francisco Giants signed two players from Nicaragua, and considered building 
a baseball academy in a move that was seen as a step to normalizing the 
relationship between Nicaragua and Major League Baseball.[9] During the 
1996 Nicaraguan presidential election, candidates, Arnoldo Alemán, and 
Daniel Ortega, promised increased funding for the Nicaraguan national baseball 
team.[6] In the spring of 2004, professional baseball returned to Nicaragua 
for the first time since 1967.[1] In a typical modern-day game, teams have 
sets of cheerleaders, as well as team mascots, and marching bands who play 
throughout the game.[1] Dennis Martínez National Stadium, located in Managua, 
Nicaragua, is used by the Indios del Bóer of the Nicaraguan Professional 
Baseball League.[1] The stadium has been described being in poor shape 
by many, including Nicaraguan native, and former Major League Baseball 
pitcher Dennis Martínez, whom the stadium is named after.[1] The World 
Baseball Classic has been criticized by NBC Sports writer Joe Connor, after 
the WBC invited national baseball teams from China, Australia, and Italy, 
over teams from Nicaragua, and Colombia, where the sport is considerably 
more popular.[10] In 2009 it was announced that a privately funded baseball 
academy would be built by the International Baseball Association in Villa 
El Carmen.[11] Fourteen players born in Nicaragua have competed in Major 
League Baseball.[12] Currently, Everth Cabrera, Erasmo Ramirez, and Cheslor 
Cuthbert are the only three active Nicaraguan players in Major League Baseball. 
A fourth Nicaraguan, J. C. Ramírez, has pitched in Major League Baseball 
but is not currently on a major league roster. The Nicaraguan Professional 
Baseball League (La Liga Nicaragüense de Beisbol Profesional in Spanish) 
is the professional baseball league in Nicaragua. There are four teams 
that compete against each other, the Indios del Bóer, the Tigres del Chinandega, 
the Leones de León, and the Orientales de Granada.[13][14][15][16] There
