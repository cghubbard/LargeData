located in the Abacoa community of the town of Jupiter, Florida. The stadium 
was built in 1998, holds 6,871 people,[2] and features luxury sky-box seating, 
two levels of permanent seating, parking and concessions. The Roger Dean 
Stadium Complex is the only stadium in the country to host four minor league 
teams: the Jupiter Hammerheads and Palm Beach Cardinals of the Class A-Advanced 
Baseball Florida State League, and the Gulf Coast Marlins and Gulf Coast 
Cardinals of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. Roger Dean Stadium is 
one of the only 2 stadiums in Florida to host two Major League Baseball 
teams annually for spring training: the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals 
(the other will be The Ballpark of The Palm Beaches, hosting the Washington 
Nationals & Houston Astros beginning in 2017). The teams share the main 
stadium where the games are played. However, the teams have their own practice 
fields, outdoor batting cages, several pitching mounds, and state-of-the-art 
conditioning rooms. Through 2002 the Montreal Expos shared the stadium 
with the Cardinals, until they swapped with the Marlins as part of the 
Marlins sale to Jeffrey Loria. The Expos, now known as the Washington Nationals, 
then moved to Space Coast Stadium in Viera, Florida. Roger Dean Stadium 
was badly damaged in 2004 by hurricanes Frances and Jeanne.[5] Cliff Politte 
threw the first pitch in the stadium's history in spring training, 1998.[6] 
In September 2012, the stadium hosted a qualifying round for the 2013 World 
Baseball Classic. Spain, France, Israel, and South Africa took part in
