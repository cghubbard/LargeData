Robert Raymond Pfeil (born November 13, 1943 in Passaic, New Jersey) is 
a former right-handed Major League Baseball third baseman who played in 
1969 and 1971 for the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies. He attended 
Reseda High School, making the varsity team his junior year.[1] Originally 
signed as an undrafted free agent by the Chicago Cubs in 1961, Pfeil was 
traded with Hal Gilson to the St. Louis Cardinals for Bob Humphreys on 
April 7, 1965. Before the start of the 1968 season, he was sent from the 
Cardinals to the Mets in an unknown transaction. He made his big league 
debut at the age of 25 on June 26, 1969 against pitcher Grant Jackson and 
the rest of the Philadelphia Phillies. Pfeil went 1-for-4 in his debut, 
although Jackson shut the Mets out 2-0 and held them to just four hits. 
In addition, he collected ten strikeouts in that game. Pfeil did well during 
the first two weeks of his debut - he was hitting .333 on July 4 - but 
by July 31 his batting average had slumped to .232. Coincidentally, that 
is what his final batting average for the season would end up being. After 
July 31, he was able to pull his average above .240 only once, and he let 
is slip down to .217 at one point. However, after going 3-for-6 in the 
final two games of the season, he brought his average up to its final mark 
of .232. In 211 at-bats, he also scored 20 runs, drove 10 runs in, doubled 
nine times, tripled and homered zero times, walked seven times and struck 
out 27 times. Although the Mets reached the playoffs and eventually won 
the World Series in 1969, Pfeil neither appeared in the playoffs or the 
Fall Classic. However, when President Nixon attended a World Series game, 
Pfeil lent him his glove for protection.[1] On May 26, 1970, Pfeil was 
sent as the player to be named later to the Phillies to complete a trade 
that occurred originally on April 10 of that year. In return for Pfeil, 
the Mets received Ron Allen. Pfeil would not appear in the majors in 1970, 
however by 1971 he was back in a Major League uniform. He appeared in 44 
games for the Phillies that year, collecting 19 hits in 70 at-bats for 
a .271 batting average. He played his final game on September 6 against 
the Cardinals as a defensive replacement. He made his big league debut 
against the Philadelphia Phillies while playing for the New York Mets. 
Coincidentally, he ended up facing the Mets while playing for the Philadelphia 
Phillies in his final career at-bat, on September 5. Overall in his big 
league career, he played in 106 games, collecting 68 hits in 281 at-bats 
for a .242 batting average. He had 12 doubles, no triples and two home 
runs to go along with 25 runs, 19 RBI, one stolen base, 13 walks and 36 
strikeouts. He had a .976 career fielding percentage. Although he didn't 
play in the majors after 1971, he was still active in the minor leagues. 
On February 8, 1972, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for a player 
to be named later, who ended up being minor leaguer Chico Vaughns. On March 
20 of that year, he was purchased by the Boston Red Sox from the Brewers.
