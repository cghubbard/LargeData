Adrian is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan and the county seat of Lenawee 
County.[6] The population was 21,133 at the 2010 census. Adrian lies in 
Michigan's 7th congressional district. Adrian was founded on June 18, 1826 
by Addison Comstock, promoter of the Erie and Kalamazoo Railroad, and was 
originally named Logan.[7] In 1828 Addison's wife renamed the village to 
Adrian after the Roman Emperor Hadrian. The only remaining piece of the 
Bank of Pennsylvania— one of the stone pillars — was moved to Adrian, Michigan 
and erected as the Civil War Memorial in commemoration of those in Adrian 
who died in the American Civil War. In the late 19th century through early 
20th century Adrian was known as the "fence capital of the world," when 
J. Wallace Page invented the first successful wire fence. Throughout this 
period, Adrian was one of the first fencing manufacturers in the world 
and its fences were shipped as far as New York, Berlin, Asia, and Africa. 
The company sponsored the highly successful Page Fence Giants black baseball 
team. One of the first motor vehicles, the Lion automobile, was created 
in Adrian. Between 1900 and 1912, Adrian was shaping up to be one of the 
motor capitals of the world, with three car models manufactured in Adrian 
during those 12 years. But due to some unfortunate turn of events, it never 
came to be. The first two were the Murry Motor Car and Lenawee Car: both 
made by the Church Manufacturing Company. Although the cars were a hit 
at the 1910 Chicago Automobile show and they sold hundreds of cars, due 
to bad financial decisions the Church Manufacturing Company ran out of 
money and had to close. The third car manufactured in Adrian was the Lion 
made by the Lion Motor Car Company. The Lion was immensely popular and 
successful; Lion Motor Car Company was taking the lead in the auto industry. 
However, on June 12, 1912, the plant caught on fire, destroyed about 200 
cars, and ultimately ended the company. Adrian is approximately 30 miles 
(48 km) southwest of Ann Arbor, 30 miles (48 km) southeast of Jackson, 
and 30 miles (48 km) northwest of Toledo, Ohio. A portion of the city is 
on the border between Adrian Township and Madison Charter Township, although 
the city is politically independent of both. The city's urban area extends 
beyond the city limits into both of those townships as well as into nearby 
Raisin Township and Palmyra Township. Adrian is sometimes referred to as 
"the Maple City" due in part to the many sugar maple and other maple tree 
species found throughout the city. The Adrian High School sports teams 
are known as the "Adrian Maples" and several local businesses use maple 
in their names. Adrian's cultural life has connections to the mid-19th 
century. The Adrian City Band is the oldest continuously active community 
band in the country,[citation needed] founded in 1836. Also of historical 
note is the Croswell Opera House. The Adrian Symphony Orchestra was founded 
in 1981. Adrian College and Siena Heights University also offer many cultural 
opportunities. Heritage Park and Trestle Park have extensive mountain bike 
trails and boardwalks along the river. Trestle Park features a pedestrian 
walkway along a former railroad trestle.[9] According to the United States 
Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 8.10 square miles (20.98 km2), 
of which 7.95 square miles (20.59 km2) is land and 0.15 square miles (0.39 km2)

Irish Hills area of Michigan, an area known for its many lakes and rolling 
hills, and home to the Irish Famine Memorial and Michigan International 
Speedway. Many town residents take advantage of this area for boating and 
recreation. Devils Lake, Round Lake, Posey Lake and Wamplers Lake are popular 
weekend destinations within a few miles. As of the census[2] of 2010, there
