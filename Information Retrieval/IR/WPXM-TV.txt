WPXM-TV, virtual and UHF digital channel 35, is an Ion Television owned-and-operated 
television station located in Miami, Florida, United States. The station 
is owned by Ion Media Networks. WPXM maintains offices and master control 
facilities located on Northwest 14th Street in Sunrise, and its transmitter 
is located on Southwest 27th Street in West Park. The station first signed 
on the air in October 1992 as WMLB-TV. Originally operating as an independent 
station, the station changed its call letters to WDLP-TV in 1993, before 
changing it again to WCTD several months later. Channel 35 was acquired 
by Paxson Communications (the forerunner of Ion Media Networks) in 1997. 
Shortly after the sale was finalized, the station became an affiliate of 
the Infomail TV Network (inTV), which carried an infomercial format. On 
August 31, 1998, the station's call letters were changed to WPXM-TV; that 
same date, the station became a charter owned-and-operated station of Pax 
TV (now Ion Television). From 2002 through the 2005 season, WPXM was the 
flagship TV station of the Florida Marlins (now the Miami Marlins), the 
baseball team that won the World Series in 1997 and 2003. It also aired 
on sister station WPXP in West Palm Beach. WPXM-TV terminated its analog 
signal, on UHF channel 35, on February 17, 2009, as part of the federally 
mandated transition from analog to digital television (which Congress later 
moved to June 12).[2] The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition 
UHF channel 26 to channel 35 on February 18. WPXM was the only Miami-licensed 
station that applied to cease analog transmissions on the original transition 
date, despite the DTV Delay Act having extended the deadline to June 12. 
WPXM elected to use UHF channel 35 as its post-transition allocation during 
the first round of the digital channel elections, and was allowed to keep 
the allocation despite a conflict with another station.[citation needed]
