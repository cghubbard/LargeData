George Andrew Hendrick, Jr. (born October 18, 1949) is a former major league 
outfielder for the Oakland Athletics, Cleveland Indians, San Diego Padres, 
Pittsburgh Pirates and California Angels. Hendrick is arguably best remembered 
as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals, for whom he played from 1978 to 
1984 and was a key player in the team's 1982 World Series win. He led the 
Cardinals in home runs every year from 1980 through 1983.[1] Hendrick is 
currently the special advisor to baseball operations for the Tampa Bay 
Rays. Over eighteen seasons, Hendrick posted a .278 batting average with 
267 home runs and 1111 RBI. His career stats included 941 runs, 1980 hits, 
343 doubles, 59 stolen bases, and a .329 on-base percentage in 7129 at-bats. 
Hendrick began his baseball career in the minor leagues with Burlington 
in 1968, leading the league with a .327 batting average and 25 doubles.[2] 
He was an all-star four times, twice with Cleveland in 1974 and 1975 and 
twice with St. Louis in 1980 and 1983, and finished in the top 15 in league 
MVP voting four consecutive years between 1980 and 1983.[3] Hendrick was 
one of the first players to hit 100 home runs in each league, 150 for the 
National League and 117 for the American League.[4] He was the first MLB 
player to wear his pant legs down to his ankles, was nicknamed "Jogging 
George" and "Captain Easy"[5] because of his reputation for not running 
plays out or giving 100% effort[6] and "Silent George" due to his longstanding 
policy of not talking to the media.[7] Besides, Angels beat reporter Lisa 
Nehus Saxon, one of the first women to cover a MLB team, credited Hendrick 
for protecting her from Reggie Jackson's harassment and verbal abuse.[8] 
In between, Hendrick played winter ball with the Cangrejeros de Santurce 
club of the Puerto Rico League, where he won the batting title in the 1973–1974 
tournament.[9] He also played for the Gold Coast Suns of the Senior Professional 
Baseball Association in its 1989 inaugural season. Hendrick began his coaching 
career with the Cardinals as a minor league hitting/outfield instructor 
from 1993 to 1995 before becoming the hitting coach of the big league club 
from 1996 to 1997. After leaving the Cardinals, he worked as coach at various 
levels in the California Angels and Los Angeles Dodgers systems from 1998 
to 2005. On November 21, 2005, Hendrick was named as a first base/outfield 
coach for Tampa Bay,[12] a position he held through the end of the 2014 
season. He then became Special Advisor to Baseball Operations for the Rays. 
His son, Brian, played college basketball for the California Golden Bears.[13]
