Carl Daniel Erskine (born December 13, 1926) is a former right-handed starting 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the Brooklyn 
and Los Angeles Dodgers from 1948 through 1959. He was a pitching mainstay 
on Dodger teams which won five National League pennants, peaking with a 
1953 season in which he won 20 games and set a World Series record with 
14 strikeouts in a single game. Erskine pitched two of the NL's seven no-hitters 
during the 1950s. Following his baseball career, he was active as a business 
executive and an author. Known as "Ersk", or more accurately "Oisk", owing 
to the Brooklynese diction of the borough, Erskine signed with the Brooklyn 
Dodgers in 1946, and after two minor league seasons he made the team in 
July 1948 as part of a powerful squad that included Roy Campanella, Carl 
Furillo, Gil Hodges, Pee Wee Reese, Jackie Robinson and Duke Snider. Along 
with Snider and Reese, he lived in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bay Ridge, 
and was frequently to be found around the baseball diamonds on Shore Road, 
offering encouragement to youngsters. He broke into the majors a year before 
Don Newcombe, and from 1948–50 was used primarily as a reliever, going 
21-10. In 1951, he mixed 19 starts with 27 relief appearances, and went 
16-12. For the following five seasons, he was right at the heart of Brooklyn's 
rotation, especially with his work in 1952-53, which was crucial for the 
NL pennant winners due to Newcombe serving in the army from 1952 until 
mid-1954. Erskine was 14-6 in 1952 with a career-best 2.70 earned run average, 
then had his 20-win season in 1953, leading the league with a .769 winning 
percentage along with 187 strikeouts and 16 complete games, all career 
highs. This was followed by 18-15 in 1954, posting career highs in starts 
(37) and innings (260-1/3), then by 11-8 in 1955 and 13-11 in 1956. When 
Newcombe was pitching in the ninth inning of the third game of the playoff 
with the New York Giants on October 3, 1951, Erskine and Ralph Branca were 
warming up in the bullpen. On the recommendation of pitching coach Clude 
Sukeforth, who thought that Branca had better stuff, Newcombe was relieved 
by Branca, who then gave up the game-winning home run to Bobby Thomson. 
Whenever Erskine was asked what his best pitch was, he replied, "The curveball 
I bounced in the Polo Grounds bullpen in 1951."[1] Erskine, author of two 
no-hitters, (against the Chicago Cubs on June 19, 1952 and the New York 
Giants on May 12, 1956), was a member of the beloved Dodgers team which 
won the 1955 World Series for the franchise's first Series title. He appeared 
in eleven World Series games (1949–52–53-55-56), and made the NL All-Star 
team in 1954. His 14 strikeouts as the winner of Game 3 of the 1953 Fall 
Classic – including striking out the side in the ninth inning – broke the 
Series record of 13 held by Howard Ehmke (1929, Game 1), and stood for 
10 years until Sandy Koufax struck out 15 New York Yankees in the first 
game of the 1963 World Series; but he was ineffective in Games 1 and 6, 
although he was not charged with the losses. From 1951 through 1956, Erskine 
won 92 games while losing only 58, which helped the Dodgers to four pennants 
during the "Boys of Summer" era. Despite his two no-hitters, Then in 1957, 
like so many of his Dodgers teammates, Erskine began his final decline. 
He moved to Los Angeles with the team the following year, but lasted only 
a season and a half. The long decline of his career had actually been set 
in motion during his rookie year when he injured his shoulder in his first 
major league start, yet not only finished the game but started twice more 
in extreme pain. So serious was the injury, in which he pulled a muscle 
away from his shoulder bone, that he was unable to throw between starts; 
by 1957, at only 31, he was on his way out, and he made his final appearance 
on June 14, 1959. In a twelve-season career, he posted a 122-78 (.610) 
record with 981 strikeouts and a 4.00 ERA in 1718.2 innings pitched. Following 
his retirement as a player, Erskine returned to his native Indiana. He 
coached at Anderson College for 12 seasons, including four Hoosier Conference 
championships, and his 1965 squad went 20-5 and reached the NAIA World 
Series. He had 18 players named to All-Conference teams, and three named 
as All-American. In 1973, his final season, he coached John Bargfeldt, 
who later spent three seasons in the minors as a Chicago Cubs prospect.[2] 
He also became a leader in the community, participating in numerous organizations 
and businesses, including rising to the presidency of the Star Bank of 
Anderson, Indiana before easing back to the role of vice chairman of the 
board. He is devoted to his son Jimmy, who has Down syndrome[3] and lives 
at home and holds a job nearby at the Hopewell Center for people with developmental 
difficulties, and to his grandchildren Abby, Amy, Luke, and Dannae. To 
commemorate Erskine's accomplishments both as a Dodger and as a citizen, 
a 6-foot (1.8 m) bronze statue was erected in front of the Carl D. Erskine 
Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine Center. Erskine also donated part of 
his land to the Anderson Community School System to build a new school, 
which was named Erskine Elementary. Erskine currently serves as a member 
of the advisory board of the Baseball Assistance Team, a 501(c)(3) non-profit 
organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and 
Negro League players through financial and medical difficulties. Erskine 
is also a very active member of the First Baptist Church of Anderson, Indiana. 
In 2002, Erskine Street in Brooklyn was created and named after him.[4][5]
