As player As manager Daniel Edward Murtaugh (October 8, 1917 – December 
2, 1976) was an American second baseman, manager, front-office executive 
and coach in Major League Baseball best known for his 29-year association 
with the Pittsburgh Pirates as a player and manager. He threw and batted 
right-handed. A native of Chester, Pennsylvania, Murtaugh played during 
nine seasons for the Philadelphia Phillies (1941–43, 1946), Boston Braves 
(1947) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1948–51). As a rookie, he led the National 
League in stolen bases with 18. He was a .254 career hitter with eight 
home runs and 219 RBI in 767 games. His most productive season came in 
1948, when he hit .290 and posted career highs in RBI (71), runs (56), 
doubles (21), triples (5) and games played (146). In 1950 he hit .294, 
also a career-high. After retiring as a player, he managed the minor league 
New Orleans Pelicans and Charleston Senators before returning to the Pirates 
as a coach (1956 through August 4, 1957). He then succeeded Bobby Bragan 
as manager and would hold the job for all or parts of 15 seasons over four 
different terms (1957–64, 1967, 1970–71, 1973–76). Murtaugh guided the 
team to two World Series championships (1960, 1971) and four Eastern Division 
titles (1970–71, 1974–75). He first retired after the 1964 season citing 
health problems, moving up to the Pirate front office evaluating players 
for general manager Joe L. Brown. However, when his immediate successor 
as manager, Harry Walker, was fired during the 1967 season, Murtaugh returned 
as interim manager for the remainder of the season, after which he returned 
to the front office. Well aware of the abundance of talent in the system, 
Murtaugh asked to reclaim the managing job after Larry Shepard was fired 
in the last week of the 1969 season. Once medically cleared, he became 
manager once again. (Only hours after this re-hiring on October 9, Don 
Hoak, his third baseman on the 1960 world champion Pirates and a manager 
in the Pirates' farm system in 1969, died of a heart attack after believing 
he was a leading contender to manage the parent club.) He stepped down 
after the 1971 championship season and his hand-picked successor, Bill 
Virdon (center fielder for his 1960 world champions), took over. When Brown 
fired Virdon in September of 1973, Murtaugh reluctantly returned to managing 
and stayed through the 1976 season, both he and Brown announcing their 
retirements during the final week of that season. On September 1, 1971, 
Murtaugh was the first manager in major league baseball history to field 
a starting lineup consisting of nine black players (African Americans and 
Afro-Latin Americans). The Pirates beat the Phillies 10-7 in that game. 
As a manager, he compiled a 1,115-950 record in 2,068 games (.540),[1] 
second in Pirates history behind only Fred Clarke. Murtaugh joined the 
Army in 1943. He declined the opportunity to play baseball in the US and 
served in combat with the 97th Infantry in Germany [2] Murtaugh died in 
his hometown of a stroke at age 59, two months after retiring. His number
