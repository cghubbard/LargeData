In baseball, a triple is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that 
the batter is able to advance all the way to third base, scoring each runner 
who was already on base, with no errors by the defensive team on the play. 
In Major League Baseball (MLB), a player in each league [L] is recognized 
for leading the league in triples.[1] Only triples hit in a particular 
league count toward that league's seasonal lead. The first triples champion 
in the National League was Ross Barnes; in the league's inaugural 1876 
season, Barnes hit fourteen triples for the Chicago White Stockings.[2] 
In 1901, the American League was established and led by two members of 
the Baltimore Orioles: Bill Keister and Jimmy Williams each had 21.[3][4]
