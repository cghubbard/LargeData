center fielder and leadoff hitter for Tiburones de La Guaira in the Venezuelan 
Winter League, hitting .315 (178 AB) in the 2006–07 season, .345 (229 AB) 
in the 2007–08 season (finishing 2nd in the MVP Award) and .349 (172 AB) 
in the 2008–09 season. He was eventually called up to the majors because 
of Jordan Schafer's struggles. Blanco signed with the Atlanta Braves on 
July 4, 2008 as an undrafted free agent. He beat out Josh Anderson in Spring 
training to become the Braves backup outfielder in 2008. He began to see 
regular playing time after Mark Kotsay injured his back on May 26. In 2008 
he had the lowest home run per plate appearance percentage in the majors 
(among regular home run hitters) (0.2%).[2] On July 31, 2010, Blanco was 
traded to the Kansas City Royals along with Jesse Chavez and Tim Collins 
for Kyle Farnsworth and Rick Ankiel. On May 8, 2011, Blanco was traded 
to the Washington Nationals in exchange for a player to be named later. 
During the offseason of 2011, Gregor played in the Venezuelan Winter league 
and was named the MVP for the 2011 season. Blanco signed a minor league 
contract with the San Francisco Giants on November 16, 2011, and was selected 
to be part of the Giants' 2012 Opening Day roster as an outfielder.[1] 
On June 13, 2012, Blanco made a fully extended diving catch in deep right-center 
field, catching the ball in the end of his mitt, to rob Jordan Schafer 
of a hit in the top of the 7th inning of Matt Cain's perfect game. The 
Mercury News wrote "In a town very familiar with the words "The Catch", 
Blanco made one for the ages: he took off on a dead sprint at the crack 
of the bat and made a diving catch on the warning track in center field, 
400 feet from home plate."[2] On July 13, 2013, in a 9-0 win over the San 
Diego Padres at Petco Park, Blanco caught the final out of Tim Lincecum's 
first career no-hitter in the ninth inning. It was the first no-hitter 
in the history of the ballpark. On September 5, 2014, Blanco made an error 
that ended his 306-game errorless streak. He was trying hard to catch Bryan 
Holaday's line drive, but instead he dropped the ball.[3] On July 8, 2016, 
Blanco hit his first career pinch-hit home run, and his first of the season.[4] 
Blanco has three children and a wife named Mirna Blanco Has a twin brother 
(not identical) with the name Gregory and a younger brother named Gregsman.
