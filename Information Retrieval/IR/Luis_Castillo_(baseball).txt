Luis Antonio Castillo (born September 12, 1975) is a former Major League 
Baseball second baseman. Castillo is a three-time All-Star, three-time 
Gold Glove winner, and won the World Series with the Florida Marlins in 
2003. He is also the only player who played for the Marlins in both of 
their World Series winning seasons who did not get traded in between the 
two seasons. On August 19, 1992 Castillo was signed as a non-drafted free 
agent by the Florida Marlins. In 1994 he played his first year of baseball 
in the Gulf Coast League, playing for the Gulf Coast Marlins. He also set 
a Marlins short-season record in stolen bases, with 31.[1] In 1995, he 
was called up to the Kane County Cougars in the Class-A Midwest League, 
and was selected to the All-Star team. He injured his shoulder in July, 
causing him to miss the rest of the season. That year, he led the entire 
Marlins organization in batting average with .326, as well as being second 
in stolen bases.[1] Castillo spent most of the 1996 season in the Eastern 
League, but was called up to the Marlins mid-season and made his major 
league debut on August 8. His first major league hit came in a game against 
the New York Mets, where he knocked in the game-winning run in the 10th 
inning. He was named to the Eastern League All-Star team and post-season 
All-Star team.[1] Castillo started playing full-time for the Marlins at 
second base during the 1997 season. Both at age 21, he and Édgar Rentería 
were the youngest middle infield combination in the history of the National 
League.[2] He bruised his left heel mid-season, and missed the entire month 
of May with the injury. He was optioned to the Triple-A Charlotte Knights 
on July 28 and did not come back to the major leagues until the next season. 
Due to this, he did not play for the Marlins during the 1997 World Series.[1] 
Castillo remained with the Charlotte Knights until being recalled to the 
Marlins on August 4, 1998. While in Charlotte, he had a streak of 32 consecutive 
games reaching base safely. With the Marlins, his highest hit streak was 
eight games, between August 14 and August 19. By the end of the season, 
he was third among Marlins minor leaguers in stolen bases, and a .203 batting 
average, 3 stolen bases and 10 RBIs.[1] Castillo improved in 1999, with 
many short hitting streaks. These streaks included six games from May 10 
to May 17, and six games from August 1 to August 7. He also had a 22-game 
hitting streak in a stretch between August 9 and September 3. He finished 
fourth in the league in stolen bases, and was fourth among leadoff hitters 
in on-base percentage at .385. He was named the Marlins Most Valuable Player 
by the South Florida Chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.[1] 
Castillo started the 2000 season with a seven-game hitting streak from 
April 5 to April 12, though he was placed on the disabled list with a strained 
back shortly afterwards. A week after coming back, he set a single-game 
team record with four stolen bases on May 17. He had 3 in the next game, 
falling short of the National League record of 8 in two games, set by Walt 
Wilmot in 1894. In 2000 he also became the Marlins all-time stolen base 
leader by stealing his 116th career base on June 20 while playing the Milwaukee 
Brewers. He finished the season with 62 stolen bases, leading the entire 
major leagues.[1] In 2001, Castillo had two hitting streaks, 8 games from 
May 6 to May 13, and 14 games from June 29 to July 22. He finished fifth 
in the league in stolen bases with 33. He also had a .263 batting average, 
45 RBIs, and 10 triples, a career high.[1] In 2002, Castillo had a 35-game 
hitting streak, which is the longest ever by a second baseman (since matched 
by fellow second baseman Chase Utley of the Philadelphia Phillies in 2006). 
This was the sixth longest streak in the history of the National League, 
and also the tenth longest in the history of Major League Baseball.[3] 
Castillo played second base in the 2002 All-Star Game, the first All-Star 
selection of his career. In 2002 he hit .305 with 39 RBIs and 48 stolen 
bases, leading the league in stolen bases for the second time in his career. 
He was again named the Marlins Most Valuable Player by the South Florida 
Chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.[1] Castillo was 
a member of the National League All-Star team in 2003, his second career 
All-Star selection. He also led the Marlins in hitting and won his first 
career Gold Glove Award. Castillo was a central figure in the NLCS Game 
6 comeback by the Marlins against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field after 
a foul ball that he hit was knocked away from the Cubs' Moisés Alou by 
fan Steve Bartman. The Marlins went on to win that game as well as Game 
7 to get to the 2003 World Series, in which the Marlins defeated the heavily 
favored New York Yankees. This was the second World Series of Castillo's 
career, but the first in which he actually played.[1] In 2004, Castillo 
had a .291 batting average with 47 RBIs, a career best. He also had 2 home 
runs and 7 triples. He was second only to Juan Pierre on the Marlins with 
a .373 on-base percentage and set a Marlins record with his 425th career 
walk passing Gary Sheffield's previous mark of 424.[4] Castillo won his 
second straight Gold Glove and posted the National League's second-best 
fielding percentage at second base (.991), behind Philadelphia's Plácido 
Polanco.[1] In his final season with the Marlins, Castillo won his third 
Gold Glove award in a row. He led the majors in batting versus left-handed 
pitchers with a .423 average.[1] Castillo was also a member of the 2005 
National League All-Star team, and replaced Jeff Kent of the Los Angeles 
Dodgers at second base in the 2nd inning. He was traded to the Minnesota 
Twins on December 2, 2005, in exchange for two minor leaguers, Scott Tyler 
and Travis Bowyer.[5] The Marlins replaced Castillo at second base with 
Dan Uggla, a Rule 5 selection from the Arizona Diamondbacks. In 2006 Castillo 
began his only full season playing for the Minnesota Twins. He had an impressive 
first month of hitting, batting .432 with 19 hits. Over that stretch, Castillo 
drove in runs in five straight games from April 13 to April 19. Castillo 
had three four-hit games for the Twins this season, on April 15, August 
5, and August 9. He had a six-game hitting streak from May 6 to May 13, 
and recorded his 300th career stolen base while facing the Chicago White 
Sox on August 26.[1] In the 2007 season Castillo set a new Major League 
Baseball record, going 143 games at second base without an error.[6] He 
also recorded his 1,500th career hit on May 29 while facing the Chicago 
White Sox. Castillo was traded by the Twins to the New York Mets on July 
30, 2007 for two minor league players, catcher Drew Butera and outfielder 
Dustin Martin.[7] He finished the season with a .301 batting average with 
1 home run, 38 RBIs and 19 stolen bases. On November 18 the Mets re-signed 
him to a 4-year contract worth a reported $25 million.[8] Castillo had 
a strong finish to the 2007 season after being traded. He reached base 
safely in 40 of his last 46 games, and scored 34 runs in his last 42 games. 
In 50 games as a Met, Castillo batted .296 with 20 RBIs and 10 stolen bases. 
In 2008, a year plagued with injuries and several bench stints, Castillo 
hit .245 in 87 games, but still managed to steal 17 bases in 19 attempts. 
In 2009 spring training Castillo led all major league players in walks, 
with 17 from 56 official at bats. On March 16, 2009, Castillo was presented 
the opportunity to bat right-handed instead of being a switch hitter. He 
declined, and continued to be a switch hitter throughout the rest of his 
career. Although the Mets struggled as a team, Castillo enjoyed a bounce-back 
year in '09, hitting .302 with 77 runs scored and a .387 on-base percentage. 
On June 12, Castillo dropped a popup from Alex Rodriguez for a two-run 
game ending error at Yankee Stadium, earning him a measure of infamy in 
the Mets–Yankees rivalry. On June 4, 2010, the Mets put Castillo on the 
DL because of problems in both his feet. He was replaced by Rubén Tejada 
who played at second base in the Mets' 5–4 win against the Florida Marlins 
at Citi Field. He was criticized along with Carlos Beltrán and Óliver Pérez 
for not going to the hospital that had soldiers who had amputated arms 
and legs, he claimed that he did not want to be horrified by the experience. 
Castillo commented on not being happy with his playing time and "has to 
work something out this offseason". During Spring training of 2010, he 
was booed by the home fans at Digital Domain Park where the Mets play their 
spring training games. He was released from the Mets spring training roster 
on March 18, 2011.[9] On March 21, 2011, Castillo signed a minor league 
deal with the Philadelphia Phillies.[10] On March 22, he reported to Phillies 
training camp. Castillo was released shortly thereafter on March 30, 2011. 
He appeared on the ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum 
2016 election and earned zero votes.[11] Castillo graduated from the class 
of 1991 at Colegio San Benito Abad in the Dominican Republic. He is married 
and has two children – Luis Jr., born on October 12, 2001,[1] and Adonai,
