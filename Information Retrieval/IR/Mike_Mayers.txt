Michael Christopher Mayers (born December 6, 1991) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Mike Mayers attended Grove City High School in Grove City, Ohio, and played 
college baseball for the Ole Miss Rebels of the University of Mississippi.[1] 
On May 13, 2013, he was selected as a Southeastern Conference Co-Pitcher 
of the Week. In his junior year, he posted a 2.83 earned run average (ERA) 
over 92 1⁄3 innings pitched (IP) with 73 strikeouts (SO) and 37 bases on 
balls (BB). Overall, in his college career, he posted a 12−9 win–loss record 
(W−L) with a 3.42 ERA and 171 strikeouts in 215 innings. He decided to 
forgo one remaining year of eligibility and avail himself to the Major 
League Baseball draft.[2] The St. Louis Cardinals selected Mayers in the 
third round of the 2013 amateur draft.[3] In 2015, Mayers underwent surgery 
for thoracic outlet syndrome, also known as TOS.[4] Recovered from TOS, 
Mayers progressed through the two highest minor league levels in 2016. 
First, he pitched for the AA Springfield Cardinals in the Texas League,[4] 
where he was selected a mid-season All-Star.[5] Over nine starts for Springfield, 
Mayers was credited with a 5−2 W−L and 2.30 ERA. After promotion to the 
AAA Memphis Redbirds of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), he made nine starts 
and was 3−3 W−L with a 2.94 ERA.[4] The Cardinals selected Mayers' contract 
from Memphis on July 23, 2016, and announced that he would make his Major 
League Baseball (MLB) debut the following day against the Los Angeles Dodgers 
on national television on ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball.[4] In his debut, 
each of the first four batters he faced in the first inning reached base, 
and all scored on a grand slam to the fourth, first baseman Adrian Gonzalez.[6] 
In all, 10 of 14 batters reached base as Mayers surrendered nine earned 
runs, eight hits and two walks, while recording four outs for an in-game 
ERA of 60.75. Per the Elias Sports Bureau, he became the first major leaguer 
to surrender at least nine runs while advancing through fewer than two 
innings in his debut.[7] Said opposing starter Scott Kazmir of Mayers, 
"I felt for him, yeah. It's your debut, it's hot and it's on ESPN. It was 
a tough draw for him."[8] The Cardinals optioned him back to Memphis the 
day after his first major league start.[7] He got his first win, in relief
