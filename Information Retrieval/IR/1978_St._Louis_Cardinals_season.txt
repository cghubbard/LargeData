The 1978 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 97th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and its 87th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
69-93 during the season and finished fifth in the National League East, 
21 games behind the Philadelphia Phillies. In late April, the Cardinals 
fired manager Vern Rapp, who had started at 7-11. He was briefly replaced 
by coach Jack Krol for two games (1-1) before giving the job on a permanent 
basis to their former MVP third-baseman Ken Boyer, who went 61-81 the rest 
of the way. On June 16, Tom Seaver of the Cincinnati Reds made history 
by pitching a no-hitter against the Cardinals. It would be the only no-hitter 
of his career. First baseman Keith Hernandez won a Gold Glove. Infielders
