Kevin John Correia (born August 24, 1980) is a retired American professional 
baseball pitcher. He has played for the Philadelphia Phillies, San Francisco 
Giants, San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Minnesota Twins and Los Angeles 
Dodgers. He attended Grossmont High School in El Cajon, California. He 
attended Grossmont Junior College and then transferred to Cal Poly, San 
Luis Obispo in 2000. Correia is of Portuguese descent. Correia was drafted 
by the San Francisco Giants in the fourth round (127th overall) of the 
2002 MLB Draft. In 2003, Correia became the first player taken in the 2002 
MLB Draft to reach the major leagues, when he appeared as a relief pitcher 
on July 10 against the Colorado Rockies. He allowed one run in 1 1⁄3 innings. 
In 2004, Baseball America named him the organization's sixth-rated prospect. 
Correia split the 2004 and 2005 seasons between the Giants and the minor 
leagues, making 12 big league starts and 16 relief appearances between 
the two seasons. Going into the 2006 season, Correia competed for the Giants' 
fifth starter spot with Brad Hennessey and Jamey Wright. Although Correia 
pitched well in spring training, Wright eventually won the spot, and Correia 
began the season in Triple-A with the Fresno Grizzlies. Correia was called 
up to the Giants in April due to injuries and poor performance by the team's 
bullpen, and was primarily used in middle relief. Correia rejoined the 
Giants' starting rotation in August 2007. After seven starts and (40 innings), 
he had a 1.80 ERA.[1] In 2008, Correia was mostly a starter, but had a 
6.05 ERA during the season and became a free agent after the season. In 
parts of six seasons with the Giants, Correia pitched in 46 games, 27 as 
a starter. His record was 14–22 and his ERA was 4.59. On December 24, 2008, 
the San Diego Padres signed Correia to a minor league deal.[2] In 2009, 
he had a slow start, with an ERA above 5.00. Padres pitching coach Darren 
Balsley began tweaking his delivery. In June, Correia started to lower 
his ERA. With the pitchers Jake Peavy and Chris Young on the disabled list, 
he soon became the ace for the Padres. On June 10, Correia only allowed 
one run through six strong innings against the Dodgers offense. On September 
25, 2009, he allowed six hits and struck out seven batters in a complete 
game shutout versus the Arizona Diamondbacks; the first of his career. 
On December 12, 2009, Correia re-signed for a one-year, $3 million contract. 
On May 9, 2010, he was scratched from a start after his younger brother, 
Trevor, died after falling from a 60-foot cliff while hiking on Santa Cruz 
Island. In his two seasons with the Padres, he was 22–21 with a 4.54 ERA 
in 61 games (59 as a starter). On December 17, 2010, the Pittsburgh Pirates 
signed Correia to a two-year, $8 million deal.[3] On March 24, 2011, the 
Pirates named him their Opening Day starter.[4] On July 24, 2012, the Pirates 
traded for Wandy Rodríguez, who took Correia's spot in the starting rotation. 
Correia then requested a trade.[5] On August 19, 2012, Correia pitched 
relief, in the Pirates' 6–3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals, which 
lasted 19 innings. The next day he pitched as the starter in a 3–1 Pirates' 
loss to the San Diego Padres, making him the first Pirates' pitcher since 
Pascual Pérez in 1981 to pitch in relief one day and then start the next 
day's game.[6] In two seasons with the Pirates, he was 24–22 with a 4.49 
ERA. He started 54 games and appeared in relief in five others. He was 
selected to represent the Pirates at the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game, but did not appear in the game. On December 13, 2012, Correia signed 
a two-year, $10 million deal with the Minnesota Twins.[7] With the Twins, 
he was 14–26 with a 4.94 ERA in 54 games (all starts). On August 9, 2014, 
Correia was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for a player 
to be named later or cash.[8] He made just three starts for the Dodgers 
and was primarily used as a long man out of the bullpen. He was 2–4 for 
them, with three of his four losses coming in extra inning games. His ERA 
was a high 8.03 as he allowed 22 earned runs to score in just 24.2 innings. 
On March 9, 2015, Correia signed a minor league contract with the Seattle 
Mariners with an invitation to spring training.[9][10] The Mariners released 
Correia on March 30 after he failed to make the Opening Day roster.[11] 
On April 7, 2015, Correia signed a minor league deal to return to the Giants.[12] 
He declared his free agency on May 31.[13] On June 8, 2015, Correia was 
signed to a Major League contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. He was 
designated for assignment on July 7.[14] Correia owns a career 44% groundball 
rate. Between 2005–2012, Correia relied on his slider and fastball. In 
2013, Correia is now relying more on his cutter, throwing it 36% of the 
time and adding a split finger to his arsenal. Correia is relying more 
on his sinker and his cutter than his fastball, which he is throwing just
