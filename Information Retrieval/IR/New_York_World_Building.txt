The New York World Building was a skyscraper in New York City designed 
by early skyscraper specialist George Browne Post and built in 1890 to 
house the now-defunct newspaper, The New York World. It was razed in 1955. 
Construction of the New York World Building began October 10, 1889, at 
53-63 Park Row, on the corner of Park Row and the now-closed Frankfort 
Street. The building was completed December 10, 1890 and claimed a height 
of 20 stories, comparable to 16 or 18 stories by current standards. The 
New York World Building was also known as the Pulitzer Building after the 
paper's owner, Joseph Pulitzer (1847-1911), who commissioned it. Pulitzer's 
private office was on the second level of the dome and looked down on other 
buildings along the street. During the 19th century, many high-rise buildings 
were constructed by newspaper companies along Park Row, immediately east 
of the old New York City Hall. This developed into a competition and a 
race for the tallest. Other contenders included the Tribune Building designed 
by Richard Morris Hunt (1876), the Potter Building (1886), the Park Row 
Building (1899), and two other buildings by George Post, the St. Paul Building 
(1895â€“1898), and the old Times Building (1889). The New York World Building 
was the winner of this competition and the tallest building in New York 
City for about five years. It was the city's first building to surpass 
the 284-foot spire of Trinity Church which, at the time, dominated the 
city's skyline. It was also featured on the cover of the World Almanac 
from 1890 to 1934. The building was owned at one time by Negro league baseball 
executive Nat Strong. The World Building was demolished in 1955 for the 
expanded car ramp entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge. A large stained glass 
window by Otto Heinigke (1850-1915), combining the Statue of Liberty and 
the New York World banner, which had been installed over the William Street 
entrance to the building in 1908 (The World had helped raise funds from 
the public for the statue's pedestal), was bought by a group headed by 
a Columbia journalism professor when the building was condemned in 1953. 
The window is now in Room 305 of the Columbia University School of Journalism, 
where it serves as the backdrop for many events, including the annual presentation
