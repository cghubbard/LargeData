Jeffrey Scot Suppan (/ˈsuːpɑːn/;[1] born January 2, 1975), known as Jeff 
Suppan, is an American retired professional baseball pitcher who played 
17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the Boston Red 
Sox, Arizona Diamondbacks, Kansas City Royals, Pittsburgh Pirates, St. 
Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers and San Diego Padres. Suppan was drafted 
out of high school (Crespi Carmelite High School) by the Boston Red Sox 
in the second round of the 1993 amateur draft, and rapidly ascended to 
the Majors making his debut at the age of 20. He played with the Red Sox 
through the 1997 season. In his first three seasons, Suppan compiled a 
9-6 record, his 1997 season marked his only season in Boston in which he 
made more than 10 starts. Although his record was 7-3 in 1997, his ERA 
was 5.69 in 22 starts. Suppan was picked up by the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks 
in 1998. In his lone season with Arizona, Suppan was 1-7 in 13 starts with 
a 6.68 ERA. Late in the 1998 season, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals. 
Suppan was a mainstay for the Royals rotation, averaging 33 starts and 
10 wins through his 4 seasons with the team. From 1999 to 2001, Suppan 
won 10 games in each season. In 2002, Suppan suffered his worst season 
as a Royal, going 9-16 in 33 starts. In 2003, he opened the season for 
the Pittsburgh Pirates after signing a one-year deal with them in January.[2] 
Through 21 starts, Suppan was 10-7 with a 3.57 ERA for the Pirates. Suppan 
was dealt at the trading deadline back to the Red Sox for their playoff 
stretch run. Suppan did not perform well during Boston's stretch run. He 
went 3-4 with a 5.57 ERA and surrendering 12 home runs. The Cardinals signed 
Suppan as a free agent in 2004, and he embarked upon a career year, posting 
a 16–9 record and a 4.16 earned run average, with 110 strikeouts, 65 walks, 
and 192 hits allowed in 188 innings. Suppan helped lead the Cards to the 
2004 World Series, where he started Game 3. His major base running mess 
up in game 3 was one of the defining moments of the World Series. In 2005 
he improved on his previous year's performance, going 16–10 with a 3.57 
ERA. He started Game 4 of the National League Championship series against 
the Houston Astros, allowing one run over five innings but came away with 
a no-decision after the Astros took the lead later in the game. Suppan 
has hit two career Major League home runs, both off Steve Trachsel of the 
New York Mets. His first was on September 10, 2005. The Cardinals won the 
game 4–2.[3] He hit his second in Game 3 of the 2006 National League Championship 
Series. The Cardinals would win the game 5–0 to take a 2–1 lead in the 
series. Suppan started Game 7 of the 2006 NLCS against the New York Mets. 
He did not factor in the decision, giving up only one run in seven innings, 
but the Cardinals won 3–1, earning him the National League Championship 
Series MVP.[4] Suppan in the 2006 NLCS had a 0.60 ERA in 15 innings pitched. 
During the 2006 offseason Suppan signed a four-year, $42 million contract 
with the Milwaukee Brewers.[5] Initial excitement in Milwaukee quickly 
waned as Suppan's performance declined over time. From 2007 to 2009, his 
walk rate, home runs allowed, and ERA climbed while his strikeouts have 
declined. While pitching in Milwaukee fans began an odd practice of wearing 
paper bags over their heads and throwing soup cans on to the field during 
Suppan's starts. Between 1995 and 2006, Suppan held a career ERA of 1.76 
at Miller Park, where he was to pitch for the Brewers in 2007. Suppan is 
one of only 8 ballplayers who pitched in the NL in 2007 who won at least 
12 games in each year from 2004–07, the others being Carlos Zambrano, Greg 
Maddux, Roy Oswalt, Tim Hudson, Derek Lowe, Jason Marquis and Johan Santana. 
Suppan, along with teammates J. J. Hardy, Bill Hall, and Chris Capuano 
appeared in an episode of The Young and the Restless which aired on CBS 
on June 20, 2007.[6] On June 7, 2008, Suppan was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list, his first DL stint since 1996.[7] After being sent to the bullpen, 
Suppan's run with Milwaukee ended after 15 appearances. On June 7, 2010, 
the Brewers released Suppan. He signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on 
June 14.[8] On January 25, 2011, the San Francisco Giants signed Suppan 
to a minor league deal.[9] On March 29, the Giants released Suppan.[10] 
On April 4, 2011, the Kansas City Royals signed Suppan to a minor league 
deal.[11] He remained the entire season in Omaha. He signed a minor league 
contract with the San Diego Padres on February 8, 2012. After a rash of 
injuries to the Padres rotation, Suppan was called up to the majors. He 
made his first start on May 2, 2012. It was his first time making a start 
since the 2010 season.[12] Suppan opted for free agency over a minor league 
assignment with the Padres on June 5, 2012, according to the Padres' official 
website. Suppan announced his retirement as a player on January 2, 2014, 
his 39th birthday. The announcement was timed for 2 PM PST, to honor his 
mother, Kathleen Suppan, who died six years earlier on the same day and 
at the same time.[13] As with many older pitchers, Suppan relies comparatively 
little on pitch speed to get outs. He is a finesse pitcher, using a variety 
of pitches with good movement to create weak contact for hitters. His expansive 
pitch repertoire includes a four-seam fastball and sinker in the mid-upper 
80s, a cut fastball in the low-mid 80s, a changeup around 80, a big curveball 
at 70, and a slider in the upper 70s.[14] Suppan, whose nickname is "Soup," 
is also a restaurateur. His restaurant, Soup's Grill, is jointly operated 
with his wife. It is located in Woodland Hills, California[15] Suppan is 
a devout Roman Catholic, appearing in the DVD Champions Of Faith and in 
Rosary Stars Praying the Gospel. He has spoken to the National Catholic 
Register about his faith.[16] He appeared in a political advertisement 
alongside Patricia Heaton, Jim Caviezel, Mike Sweeney, and Kurt Warner, 
among others, during the 2006 World Series. The advertisement aired in 
opposition to Missouri Constitutional Amendment 2 (2006), which allows 
in Missouri any kind of embryonic stem cell research that is legal under 
federal law. The advertisement aired shortly after the airing of an earlier 
advertisement featuring actor Michael J. Fox.[17] The Fox advertisement 
had supported Amendment 2, as well as the campaign of United States Senate 
candidate Claire McCaskill. The Suppan advertisement did not explicitly 
mention the Senate race. The timing of both ads during a World Series that 
featured the St. Louis Cardinals was intended to draw the particular attention
