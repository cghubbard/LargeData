Jack Edward DiLauro (born May 3, 1943 in Akron, Ohio) is a former Major 
League Baseball pitcher who played for the 1969 World Series Champion New 
York Mets. DiLauro started his professional baseball career by signing 
with the Detroit Tigers as an amateur free agent on January 1, 1963.[1][2] 
He never played in the Major Leagues for the Tigers.[1] On December 4, 
1968 he was traded to the New York Mets in exchange for Hector Valle.[1] 
In 1969, DiLauro pitched 4 games for the Mets AAA minor league affiliate, 
the Tidewater Tides.[3] He was then promoted to the Mets and made his major 
league debut for the Mets on May 15, 1969 against the Atlanta Braves.[1][4] 
In 1969, he pitched in 23 games, mostly in relief, and 63 2⁄3 innings for 
the Mets.[1] He won 1 game against 4 losses with 1 save.[1] The win, his 
first in the Major Leagues occurred on July 20 against the Montreal Expos.[4] 
His ERA in 1969 was a solid 2.40, better than league average.[1] The Mets 
won the World Series in 1969,[5] but DiLauro did not pitch in the postseason.[1] 
After the season, DiLauro was drafted from the Mets by the Houston Astros 
in the rule 5 draft.[1] In 1970 DiLauro pitched in 42 games for the Astros, 
all in relief, pitching 33 2⁄3 innings. He had 1 win and 3 losses with 
3 saves.[1] He was sold by the Astros to the Hawaii Islanders, the San 
Diego Padres AAA team in the Pacific Coast League on March 15, 1971.[6] 
In July 1971 he was traded with Hank McGraw (brother of DiLauro's former 
Mets teammate Tug McGraw) to the Atlanta Braves organization for Marv Staehle.[7] 
But he never pitched in the major leagues after 1970.[1] As of August 23, 
2008 DiLauro's Mets ERA of 2.40 is 3rd best all-time among Mets pitchers 
with at least 50 innings pitched for the team, behind only Carlos Diaz
