Carlos Felipe Peña (born May 17, 1978) is a Dominican–American former professional 
baseball first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the 
Texas Rangers, Oakland Athletics, Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox, Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays/Rays, Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros and Kansas City Royals. 
Although he was born in Santo Domingo and his family is from San Francisco 
de Macorís, he spent a significant portion of his childhood in the United 
States. He is portrayed in the film Moneyball by actor Adrian Bellani. 
Peña is the oldest of four children born to Felipe and Juana Marisela Peña. 
The family moved to the United States from the Dominican Republic when 
Peña was 12, initially living with one of his uncles. He graduated from 
Haverhill High School in Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1995. Peña initially 
went to Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, but returned home after 
one quarter and attended Northeastern, where he studied electrical engineering. 
As a collegiate player, he competed in the Cape Cod League, which showcases 
top amateur prospects every summer. He was a member of the Harwich Mariners 
in 1996 and the Wareham Gatemen in 1997.[1] During his time at Northeastern, 
Peña led the Huskies to one NCAA tournament. Peña's career batting average 
at Northeastern was .324 and he finished with 24 home runs in two seasons.[2] 
In 1998, Peña was selected in the first round (tenth overall) by the Texas 
Rangers in the Major League Baseball draft. Peña played for three different 
Rangers affiliates in 1998. Prior to the 1999 season, Peña was named by 
Baseball America as the 93rd prospect in their top 100 prospects list. 
In 1999, Peña played for the Charlotte Rangers, the Rangers Advanced Single-A 
team. He batted .255 with 18 home runs in 138 games. Peña was promoted 
to the Double-A Tulsa Drillers in 2000, where he batted .299 with 28 home 
runs and 105 RBIs in 138 games. Peña appeared in Baseball America's top 
100 prospect list in 2001, this time at #11 and was the Rangers' top prospect. 
He advanced another level in 2001, this time playing for the Oklahoma Redhawks, 
the Rangers' Triple-A affiliate. He played in 119 games for the Redhawks, 
in which he batted .288 with 23 home runs and 74 RBIs. Peña was also a 
Triple-A All-Star in 2001. Following the 2001 minor league season, the 
Rangers called him up to the big leagues during September, when rosters 
expanded. Peña made his Major League debut on September 5, starting at 
first base Wearing #15 and going hitless in three at-bats. Peña finished 
the 2001 season with a .258 batting average and three home runs in 22 games 
played. On January 14, 2002, along with Mike Venafro, Peña was traded to 
the Oakland Athletics by the Rangers for Jason Hart, Gerald Laird, Ryan 
Ludwick, and Mario Ramos. In 40 games with the A's, Peña hit .218 with 
7 home runs and 16 RBIs. During a stint with Triple-A Sacramento from July 
2–5, he hit .438 with 2 home runs and 6 RBIs. Peña was mentioned several 
times in Michael Lewis' book Moneyball and was a minor character in the 
film based on the book. Peña was involved in a three team deal on July 
6, 2002. The Athletics sent Peña, a player to be named later (later named 
as Jeremy Bonderman), and Franklyn Germán to the Detroit Tigers. The New 
York Yankees sent Ted Lilly, John-Ford Griffin, and Jason Arnold to the 
Athletics. The Tigers sent Jeff Weaver to the Yankees and cash to the Athletics. 
The Tigers had acquired Peña due to a season-ending injury to designated 
hitter Dmitri Young[citation needed] and the first baseman at the time 
of the trade for the Tigers, Randall Simon, immediately became the Tigers' 
designated hitter following Peña's acquisition. Peña made his Tigers' debut 
the next day against the Boston Red Sox, as he went 3–4 with 2 doubles 
and 2 RBIs. Peña played in 75 games for the Tigers in 2002 and batted .253 
with 12 home runs and 36 RBIs. Overall he batted .242 with 19 home runs 
and 52 RBIs in 115 games. His 2002 season included a 12-game hitting streak 
from September 8–21, which tied teammate Omar Infante for the longest hitting 
streak for an American League rookie in 2002. Peña played in his first 
full season in 2003 as the Tigers' everyday first baseman. On May 19, against 
the Cleveland Indians, he established career highs with 3 home runs and 
7 RBIs. Peña also missed nearly a month in June when he suffered a left 
calf strain. He played in 131 games for the Tigers in 2003 and batted .248 
with 18 home runs and 59 RBIs. In 2004, Peña established career highs in

walks (70), and strikeouts (146). Peña also batted .241 in 2004. On May 
27, 2004, against the Kansas City Royals, Peña matched a Tigers' nine-inning, 
single-game record with a career-high six hits. He became the fifth player 
in franchise history to do so and the first since Damion Easley on August 
8, 2001, against the Texas Rangers. He batted in the eighth spot in the 
batting order and his six hits were the most from the eighth spot since 
Wilbert Robinson of the Baltimore Orioles collected seven hits on June 
10, 1892 against St. Louis. Peña began the 2005 season as the Tigers' starting 
first baseman. After playing in 40 games in which he batted .181 with 3 
home runs and 14 RBIs, Peña was demoted to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens, 
where he played in 71 games for the Mud Hens and batted .311 with 12 home 
runs and 71 RBIs. Following an injury to shortstop Carlos Guillén, Peña

the Tigers released him on March 26, 2006. While with the Tigers, Peña 
hit the longest home run in Comerica Park history.[3] Peña signed a minor 
league contract with the New York Yankees on April 15, 2006. He played 
at the Triple-A level for the Columbus Clippers. Playing in 105 games, 
he batted .260 with 19 home runs and 66 RBIs. Peña exercised a clause in 
his contract and became a free agent on August 16. On August 17, 2006, 
Peña signed a minor league contract with the Red Sox and was assigned to 
Triple-A Pawtucket. At Pawtucket, Peña played in 11 games and batted .459

September 4, Peña hit his only home run of the season. He was a defensive

home run off Brandon McCarthy of the Chicago White Sox. Peña ended up playing 
in 18 games for the Red Sox in 2006. He batted .273 with 1 home run and 
three RBIs. Following the season, he opted for free agency. Peña signed 
a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on February 1, 2007 
with an invitation to spring training. The Rays reassigned Peña to minor 
league camp. With a knee injury to Greg Norton on the last day of spring 
training, the Rays re-signed him, this time to a Major League contract 
on April 1. Peña was on the Rays' active roster throughout the 2007 season. 
Peña had a slow start to his 2007 season, batting .213 with four home runs 
in the month of April as a backup player. Peña hit .356 with six home runs 
and 15 RBIs in May as an everyday player and was the Rays' first baseman 
for the rest of the season. He had four multi-home run games from August 
26 to September 22. Peña would go on to have the best season of his career 
in 2007 and set numerous career highs. He finished the season with a .282 
batting average, 46 home runs and 121 RBIs. His batting average, home runs, 
and RBIs were career highs, as well as games played (148), at bats (490), 
runs scored (99), doubles (29), total bases (307), on-base percentage (.411), 
slugging percentage (.627), walks (103), and strikeouts (142). He was second 
in the American League in home runs to Alex Rodriguez' 54. His home run, 
RBIs, slugging percentage, on-base percentage and walk totals also set 
Rays franchise records. In 2007, he had the lowest range factor of all 
AL league first basemen, 8.73. Peña's season led to his being named the 
2007 American League Comeback Player of the Year and he was considered 
as an AL MVP candidate. He also was named the Player's Choice AL Comeback 
Player of the Year by fellow players. Peña was allowed to donate $20,000 
to Dominican youth under the poverty line.[4] In 2008, Peña had .227 batting 
average and 11 home runs in 207 at-bats through June 4, 2008. A day after 
going 2–3 with a home run and three runs batted in against the Boston Red 
Sox, Peña was placed on the fifteen-day disabled placed on June 4, 2008 
due to a broken finger. He returned to action from the disabled list on 
June 27, and finished the season with a .247 batting average, 31 home runs, 
and 102 RBIs. Peña homered once every 15.8 at-bats, the highest ratio on 
the Rays.[5] One of his home runs, on September 19 against the Minnesota 
Twins, was the result of the first call overturned by instant replay in 
MLB history.[6] After the 2008 season ended, he was awarded his first (and 
also the first for a Tampa Bay Rays franchise player) AL Gold Glove. Peña 
was elected for the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, replacing 
Dustin Pedroia and participated in the 2009 Home Run Derby where he lost 
in a batoff against Albert Pujols in the first round. On September 7, 2009 
Peña suffered two broken fingers after getting hit by a pitch, which put 
him out for the rest of the 2009 season.[7] Despite missing the last few 
weeks of the season, he still finished tied for the lead for home runs 
in the American League at 39 with Mark Teixeira of the New York Yankees.[8] 
Peña's three-year contract with the Rays, reported by the St. Petersburg 
Times as worth $24.125 million, expired at the end of the 2010 season.[9] 
In 2010 with the Rays, he hit 28 home runs drove in 84 runs and finished 
the season with a .196 batting average (below the Mendoza line), the lowest 
average of anyone in the Majors that qualified for the batting title. He 
also started 135 games at first base for the Rays and played in 144 games. 
In the 2010 American League Division Series against Texas, Peña got his 
first triple of the year off Rangers starter Tommy Hunter in Game 4 on 
October 10, helping the Rays even the playoff series at two games apiece. 
The day before, he had gone 2-for-3 with a home run. The Rays would lose 
the series, 3–2. On December 8, 2010, Carlos Peña signed a one-year contract

He returned to his #23 uniform number he had in his previous tenure with 
the Rays.[13] During opening day on April 6, 2012 against the Yankees, 
Peña hit a grand slam off of CC Sabathia in his first at-bat and later,

he described as, "people uniting for a good cause, people showing their 
good heart".[9] Peña is also a spokesman for Big Brothers Big Sisters of
