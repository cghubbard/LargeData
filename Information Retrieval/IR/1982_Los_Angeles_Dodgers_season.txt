KTTV (11) (Vin Scully, Jerry Doggett, Ross Porter) KABC (Vin Scully, Jerry 
Doggett, Ross Porter) The 1982 Los Angeles Dodgers entered the season as 
the defending World Series champions. They would remain in contention until 
the final day of the regular season, when the San Francisco Giants would 
knock them out of the National League West division race, in a season that 
saw the Atlanta Braves reach the playoffs instead. The Dodgers finished 
second in the National League West at 88â€“74, becoming the fifth team since 
1969 to miss the playoffs one year after winning the World Series. This 
was the final L.A. season for longtime cornerstones Steve Garvey and Ron 
Cey, who would move on to new teams next season. The Dodgers did welcome 
new second baseman Steve Sax, who won the Rookie of the Year Award. Infielders
