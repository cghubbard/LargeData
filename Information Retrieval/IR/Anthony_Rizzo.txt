Anthony Vincent Rizzo (born August 8, 1989) is an Italian-American professional 
baseball first baseman for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He is a three-time All-Star. Rizzo was selected by the Boston Red Sox in 
the sixth round of the 2007 MLB draft and became a top minor league prospect 
in the Red Sox organization. He was traded to the San Diego Padres after 
the 2010 season along with three other prospects in exchange for All-Star 
first baseman Adrian Gonzalez. After being traded to the Cubs in 2012, 
he developed into an All-Star player. Rizzo was a sixth-round draft choice 
out of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida in the 
2007 Major League Baseball draft by the Red Sox.[1] He was heading for 
Florida Atlantic University before he was drafted and signed with a $325,000 
signing bonus.[2] He played in the Red Sox organization with the Gulf Coast 
League Red Sox, Greenville Drive, Salem Red Sox and the Portland Sea Dogs.[3] 
Rizzo hit 12 home runs in 2009.[4] In 2010, he hit a combined .260 with 
an on-base percentage (OBP) of .334 and a slugging percentage (SLG) of 
.480 along with 42 doubles, 25 home runs and 100 RBIs between stops at 
High-A Salem and Double-A Portland.[3] He credited the easing of his swing 
and making better use of his legs for his power surge.[4] On December 6, 
2010, Rizzo was traded along with Casey Kelly, Reymond Fuentes, and Eric 
Patterson to the Padres for three-time All-Star first baseman Adrian Gonzalez.[5][6] 
Rizzo was considered the third best prospect (Kelly was #1) and the best 
power-hitting prospect in the Red Sox organization.[7][8] Kevin Boles, 
Rizzo's manager at Salem, also previously managed Gonzalez in the minors. 
Boles said, "Rizzo reminds me a lot of Adrian Gonzalez ... Rizzo is a bigger 
kid and has a little more power, Adrian is a little more of a contact hitter, 
but they had very similar styles of play ... We thought very highly of 
Anthony Rizzo. He's going to be a heck of a player.'"[9] Padres General 
Manager Jed Hoyer expected either Rizzo or Kyle Blanks to eventually be 
the Padres major league starting first baseman.[10] The Padres invited 
Rizzo as a non-roster player to their major league camp for 2011 Spring 
training.[11] He started the 2011 season in Triple-A with the Tucson Padres.[12] 
In his first 15 games, Rizzo hit .452 with six home runs and 24 RBIs.[13] 
In May 2011, The San Diego Union-Tribune wrote that Rizzo's debut in the 
Major Leagues might be delayed by the Padres despite the club's hitting 
deficiencies due to cost considerations created by the "Super Two" exception 
for salary arbitration eligibility. The team cited Rizzo's lack of experience 
above Double-A and his limited exposure to left-handed pitching as benefits 
of his continuing to play in Tucson.[14][15] He was called up to the majors 
after hitting .365 with an OPS of 1.159 along with 16 homers and 63 RBI 
in 200 at-bats over 52 games in Tucson.[1][16][17] The San Diego Union-Tribune 
called Rizzo "the most celebrated Padres call-up" since Roberto Alomar 
debuted with the team in 1988. Rizzo's promotion was prompted by the Padres' 
inadequate offensive production and fielding play of veterans at first 
base.[17] In his debut on June 9, 2011, against the Washington Nationals, 
Rizzo struck out in his first at-bat, but then proceeded to hit a triple 
and score a run, helping the Padres to a 7–3 victory.[18] He hit his first 
home run on June 11 against John Lannan.[19] After three games he was 3-for-7 
with a double, triple and a home run, while he demonstrated patience in 
drawing four walks for a .667 on-base percentage (OBP).[15] On July 22, 
2011 Rizzo was demoted back to Triple-A, and Blanks was promoted. Rizzo 
had struggled with only a .143 batting average and 1 home run, striking 
out 36 times in 98 at-bats.[15][20] Hoyer said Rizzo "worked hard, never 
made excuses, and endeared himself to his teammates" during his initial 
stint in the majors.[15] Rizzo was recalled to the majors on September 
4 after finishing the season at Tucson batting .331 with 26 homers and 
101 RBI in 93 games.[21] He finished his first season in San Diego hitting 
only .141 with 46 strikeouts in 128 at-bats. Hoyer believed Rizzo would 
be the starting first baseman for the Padres in 2012 with Jesús Guzmán 
as the second option.[22] However, Yonder Alonso moved ahead of Rizzo on 
the team's depth chart after he was acquired by the Padres in December 
2011 in a trade for Mat Latos.[23] On January 6, 2012, the Padres traded 
Rizzo and right-handed starting pitcher Zach Cates to the Chicago Cubs 
in exchange for right-handed starting pitcher Andrew Cashner and outfielder 
Kyung-Min Na. The deal was negotiated by Jed Hoyer, the Cubs' general manager. 
Hoyer had also drafted Rizzo while working as an assistant general manager 
for the Red Sox, and later acquired Rizzo while he was the Padres' general 
manager.[24] He blamed himself for calling up Rizzo to the majors too early 
in San Diego.[25][26] Rizzo started the 2012 season with the Triple-A Iowa 
Cubs. He again excelled in the minor leagues, batting .342 average with 
23 home runs and 62 RBIs before being recalled by the Cubs on June 26.[25] 
Similar to his call-up in San Diego, he was expected to help a struggling 
offense.[26] He became the first player in Cubs history to have three game-winning 
RBIs in his first five games with the team. He hit seven homers in July, 
the most by a Cubs rookie in a calendar month since Mel Hall hit nine in 
August 1983. He also led National League (NL) rookies that month in homers, 
hits (32), RBIs (17) and total bases (55). He ranked second among NL rookies 
in runs scored (14), and he was third with a .330 batting average, .375 
on-base percentage and .567 slugging percentage. He was named the league's 
July Rookie of the Month.[27] On May 12, 2013, Rizzo agreed to a 7-year, 
$41 million deal. The deal included two club options that could extend 
the contract to 9 years and $73 million. He was named as the Cubs finalist 
for the national Heart and Hustle Award, and he was also named the Cubs 
finalist for the Roberto Clemente Award. Rizzo placed 2nd for the Gold 
Glove award for first basemen.[28] Despite having an off year in 2013, 
Rizzo showed good power, belting 23 homers and 40 doubles in 606 at bats 
with a .233 batting average.[29][30] Rizzo had his fifth multi-homer game 
on May 31,[31] and his second career walk-off home run on June 6.[32] Rizzo 
was voted into the All-Star game via the final vote by fans along with 
White Sox pitcher Chris Sale. Rizzo joined teammate Starlin Castro in Minneapolis 
for the All-Star game. In late July, Rizzo won his first Player of the 
Week award.[33] In mid-September Rizzo became the youngest player to receive 
the Branch Rickey Award as "a strong role model for young people".[34] 
Rizzo finished the season with a combined on-base and slugging percentage 
of .913 (3rd in the NL), 32 HR's (2nd in the NL) and an at-bats per HR 
percentage of 16.4 (2nd in the NL) and placed 10th in the National League 
MVP voting.[29][35][36] Rizzo was elected on the player's ballot for the 
2015 All-Star Team. It made the second consecutive year he played in the 
game. He also competed in the 2015 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby 
for the first time in his career, but lost in the first round of the derby 
to Josh Donaldson.[37] Rizzo hit his 100th career home run and 300th RBI 
on September 8, 2015, against Cardinals pitcher Michael Wacha. Rizzo was 
hit by a pitch 30 times in 2015 and joined Don Baylor as the only other 
member of the 30HR/30HBP club.[38] Rizzo finished the regular season with 
a .278 batting average, 31 home runs, 38 doubles and 101 RBI in 701 plate 
appearances and placed 4th in National League MVP voting.[29][39] Rizzo 
started as the first baseman at the 2016 All-Star game, receiving the most 
fan votes in the National League.[40] By the end of the year, Rizzo had 
become one of the few players in Cub history to hit over 40 doubles and 
30 home runs in the same year. Only three other players in the long history 
of the Cubs had achieved that feat. Rizzo was the first "lefty".[41] Rizzo 
played in 155 games with 583 at bats and crossed the plate 94 times. He 
had 170 hits with 43 doubles, 4 triples, 32 home runs and 109 RBIs. He 
finished the year with a batting average of .292. Rizzo was one of six 
finalists for the Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award [42]and was the Cubs 
nominee for the Roberto Clemente Award.[43] After an extremely slow start 
in the 2016 postseason, Rizzo broke out of his slump and was an integral 
part of the last three victories over Los Angeles and led the Cubs to their 
first World Series appearance since 1945. In the 2016 World Series, Rizzo 
scored 7 runs and hit 5 RBIs, and helped the Cubs win their first World 
Series title since 1908. [44] As his family originated in the Sicilian 
town of Ciminna,[45] Rizzo chose to play for Italy in the 2013 World Baseball 
Classic before the 2013 season.[46] Rizzo has an older brother, John, who 
was a lineman for the Florida Atlantic University football team.[2] Rizzo 
was diagnosed with limited state classical Hodgkin's lymphoma in April 
2008.[47] Rizzo went through chemotherapy for six months.[2][48] His grandmother 
was battling breast cancer at the same time. On September 2, 2008, Rizzo's 
doctor told him he was in remission. He still had six weeks left of treatment 
and had some follow-up testing. On November 18, Rizzo's doctor told him 
he "could live a normal life." In 2012, The Anthony Rizzo Family Foundation 
began. It is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, benefiting cancer research 
and the families fighting the disease. The foundation is run entirely by 
Rizzo's family, his close friends and his management team. Rizzo provides
