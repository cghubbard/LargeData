Charles H. Getzein (sometimes spelled Getzien) (February 14, 1864 – June 
19, 1932) was an American professional baseball player from 1883 to 1891. 
He played all or parts of nine seasons in Major League Baseball with four 
different National League teams from 1884 to 1891. He was the first German 
in MLB history Getzein was known by the nickname "Pretzels". Sources conflict 
as to whether the nickname was derived from his German ethnicity or from 
the belief that he was able to throw a "double curve" following "the curves 
of a pretzel." During nine major league seasons, Getzein compiled a 145-139 
win-loss record and a 3.46 earned run average (ERA). He threw 277 complete 
games, a total that ranks 58th in major league history. Only three pitchers 
threw more complete games in major league careers shorter than Getzein's 
nine-year career. Getzein had his most extensive playing time with the 
Detroit Wolverines, compiling records of 30-11 and 29-13 in 1886 and 1887. 
In the 1887 World Series (which Detroit won, 10 games to 5), Getzein pitched 
six complete games and compiled a 4-2 record with a 2.48 ERA. He also won 
23 games for the Boston Beaneaters in 1890. Getzein was born in 1864, but 
sources are in conflict as to whether he was born in Chicago or Germany.[1][2] 
Getzein began playing baseball as a boy in Chicago.[2] He played as an 
amateur in the Chicago City League.[3] During his career, Getzein's drew 
acclaim for his curveball. Getzein's version of the pitch was sometimes 
referred to as the "pretzel curve."[2][4] Sporting Life described Getzein's 
unusual delivery as follows: "In delivering his 'pretzels' 'Getz' faces 
third base with one foot in either corner of the lower end of the box. 
Bending the left knee slightly, he draws his right arm well back. Then, 
straightening up quickly, he slides the left foot forward with a characteristic 
little skip, and, bringing his arm around with a swift overhand swing, 
drives the ball in at a lively pace."[2] After a Getzein victory over the 
Kansas City Cowboys in 1886, the Detroit Free Press wrote: "The Pretzel 
is all right. He went into the box to-day and pitched one of his finest, 
his curves circling around in the form of the delicious pastry from which 
Getz takes his sobriquet."[5] However, the editor of the Grand Rapids World 
opined that Getzein's "curved ball" was a fiction. He wrote: "The baseball 
enthusiasts claim for Getzein that he is able to so pitch a ball that it 
will describe the arc of a circle on a horizontal plane before reaching 
the catcher, and that therein lies the secret of his marvelous pitching 
. . . Scientifically, this theory is utterly absurd. The forces that act 
upon a ball pitched by Getzein are not different from those which operate 
upon a projectile thrown from any other source, and the results must be 
the same, and governed by the same laws. The curves are in the imagination 
of Getzein's admirers. When the ball leaves his hand it is beyond his control, 
and it moves forward from the impulse last given it as it leaves his hand. 
It is then controlled by the force of propulsion, the resistance of the 
atmosphere, and gravitation. . . . Getzein's antic and deceptive motions 
may deceive the batter, so that he is unable to discover the exact course 
of the ball in time to strike it, but he cannot throw a ball so as to make 
a curve on the horizontal plane."[6] The Scientific American magazine responded 
in July 1886 by publishing an article written by Henry Chadwick (accompanied 
by several diagrams, two of which are reproduced above) explaining the 
physics behind the curve ball pitch.[6] In 1891, O. P. Caylor in Outing 
magazine examined "The Theory and Introduction of Curve Pitching" and noted 
that many "ignorant ball players" had believed that Getzein was capable 
of throwing a "double curve."[7] Caylor deemed the "double curve" to be 
"an ocular delusion", but claimed that Getzein's nickname was based on 
the delusion: "[W]e have the nickname of 'the Pretzel Pitcher,' given to 
Getzein by players who imagine the curve from his hands comes at them with 
the curves of a pretzel."[7] Getzein was known by the nickname "Pretzels". 
Sources conflict as to whether the nickname was derived from his German 
ethnicity or from the belief that he was able to throw a "double curve" 
following "the curves of a pretzel."[7] Getzein was listed at 5 feet, 10 
inches, and 172 pounds, and he batted and threw right handed.[1] In 1882, 
Getzein made his professional baseball debut with the Grand Rapids, Michigan, 
team in the Northwestern League.[2][3] According to an account published 
in The Sporting News, he "pitched his puzzling twisters and curves in the 
Northwestern League while that organization was in existence."[2] During 
the 1884 season, Getzein started and completed 30 games, and threw 11 shutouts, 
for Grand Rapids, compiling a record of 27–4 win–loss record with a 0.52 earned 
run average (ERA).[8] On August 9, 1884, the Grand Rapids team was dropped 
from the Northwestern League and disbanded. Jack Chapman, manager of the 
Detroit Wolverines, seized the opportunity to sign five former Grand Rapids 
players, including "what is known as the 'G' battery -- Getzein and Gastfield."[9] 
The Detroit Free Press reported that Getzein "has been a formidable man 
to face in the Northwestern League, in one instance striking out sixteen 
batters."[9] Getzein made his major league debut at Detroit's Recreation 
Park on August 13, 1884. Getzein faced Cleveland and did not allow an earned 
run. The Detroit Free Press took note of Getzein's performance: "Getzien 
caused the Cleveland batters to pound the air thirty-seven times, and eleven 
more strikes were called. It is a great record, and one that is seldom 
equaled. He had great speed at the outset, and struck out six of the first 
eight men who came to the bat. He could not maintain the pace, however, 
and was not so effective in the latter portion of the game, but was sufficiently 
so to prevent any one from earning a run."[10] Despite Getzein's pitching 
performance, Detroit lost the game by a 1–0 score as Cleveland scored an 
unearned run.[10] Getzein went on to start (and complete) 17 games for 
the Wolverines during the remaining two months of the 1883 season. He posted 
a 5–12 record for a Detroit team that finished in last place in the National 
League with a 28–84 record, 56 games out of contention.[11] Getzein provided 
one of the few highlights for the 1884 Wolverines, pitching a six-inning 
no-hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies on October 1, 1884.[12] The 
Detroit Free Press reported on Getzein's no-hitter as follows: "When Spalding 
compiles the history of remarkable games for his Guide for 1885, it will 
embrace the fact that in the Detroit-Philadelphia game of October 1 Getzien, 
the Detroit pitcher, was not batted for a base – a feat seldom accomplished. 
It should contain further fact that of eighteen men at bat he struck out 
ten, and of the other eight but one hit the ball beyond the diamond – Purcell, 
in the first inning, a fly to Weidman. Of the other seven, only three hit 
to the diamond, or a total of four balls struck inside the foul lines. 
Of the eighteen, [Detroit catcher] Gastfield put out eleven and threw out 
three others, Bennett, Scott and Weidman each had a fly, and Jones threw 
one out at first."[13] Getzein finished the 1884 season with a 1.95 ERA, 
third best in the National League behind Old Hoss Radbourn (1.38) and Charlie 
Sweeney (1.95), both of whom played for the league champion Providence 
Grays.[14] Over the course of the full 1884 season, pitching for both Grand 
Rapids and Detroit, Getzein started and completed 47 games and pitched 
423-1/3 innings.[1][8] In 1885, Getzein compiled a 12–25 record as his 
ERA jumped to 3.03.[1] His record in 1885 was again impacted by playing 
with an noncompetitive team. The 1885 Wolverines finished the season in 
sixth place with a 41–67 record.[15] In 1886, Getzein and the Wolverines 
saw their fortunes rise as the Wolverines assembled one of the best hitting 
teams in National League history featuring, among others, Dan Brouthers, 
Sam Thompson, Hardy Richardson, and Jack Rowe. Despite having a 3.03 ERA 
(precisely the same as his 1885 performance), Getzein won a career-high 
30 victories against 11 losses.[1] Getzein was not the Wolverines' leading 
pitcher in 1886, as teammate Lady Baldwin led the National League with 
42 wins. The 1886 Wolverines finished in second place, 2½ games behind 
the Chicago White Stockings, with an 87–36 record and a .707 winning percentage.[16] 
In 1887, Getzein was the leading pitcher on a Detroit Wolverines team that 
won the National League pennant and then defeated the St. Louis Browns 
in the 1887 World Series.[17] Getzein compiled a 29–13 record and a 3.73 ERA, 
leading the league in winning percentage (.690) but also in home runs allowed (24).[1] 
In September 1887, a group of influential fans in Detroit contributed money 
to purchase "an elegant two hundred dollar gold watch and chain" for Getzein 
to express their admiration for Getzein's "magnificent work for the club."[18] 
In the 1887 World Series (which Detroit won, 10 games to 5), Getzein pitched 
six complete games and compiled a 4–2 record with a 2.48 ERA.[1] On October 17, 
1887, Getzein pitched a no-hitter through the first eight innings in Game 10 
of the World Series played before 10,000 spectators at the Polo Grounds 
in New York. The Detroit Free Press wrote: "Getzien made a remarkable showing. 
Up to and including the eighth inning only twenty-seven men went to the 
bat and not a clean hit had been scored. Not till the ninth did the world 
beaters succeed in getting a hit, and then they failed to score the much 
desired run."[19] In 1888, Getzein compiled an 18–22 record and a 3.05 ERA. 
He started 46 games and completed 45 of them with 404 innings pitched.[1] 
However, Getzein lost his role at the team's leading pitcher, as Pete Conway 
compiled a 30–14 record and a 2.25 ERA for the 1888 Wolverines.[20] After 
Getzein gave up 10 runs in an August 1888 game against Washington, the 
Detroit Free Press dubbed him the "Pulverized Pretzel."[21] The newspaper 
reported: "The Detroits were defeated again to-day ... simply because Getzein 
could not keep the ball away from the Senatorial bat. When he pitched high 
they hit it. When he delivered his famous drop, he was knocked out of the 
lot, and his in and out curves were as big as balloons to Ted Sullivan's 
men."[21] As the 1888 season progressed, relations between Getzein and 
the Detroit manager became strained. After a game in which Getzein gave 
up 21 hits against Boston, The Sporting Life reported on speculation that 
Getzein may have intentionally thrown the game: "The Getzein episode makes 
Detroiters weary. The Bostons have no license to make 21 hits off the Pretzel 
when he pitches his game. Either he was not in condition to pitch or he 
didn't try to. . . . If the latter, and he repeated his performance against 
the Kansas Citys a few years ago, when he deliberately tossed the balls 
to the plate and permitted the Cowboys to make 13 runs in one inning, why 
no one here would mourn much if he was fined to the limit. What the merits 
of his quarrel with Watkins are of course are not known here. But Getzein 
is inclined to be very free with his tongue. Considering his fine treatment 
here it is time for him to get over his childish humors and do the best 
he knows how whenever called on."[22] Getzein's career with the Wolverines 
ended after the 1888 season. On March 5, 1889, he was sold by Detroit to 
the Indianapolis Hoosiers.[1][23] During the 1889 season, he compiled an 
18–22 record and a 4.54 ERA for the Hoosiers and led the National League 
in home runs allowed with 27.[1] After a sub par season with the Hoosiers, 
Getzein was acquired by the Boston Beaneaters in March 1890. He returned 
to good form in 1890, compiling a 23–17 record with a 3.19 ERA for the 
fifth-place Beaneaters.[1] While pitching for Detroit in 1887, Getzein 
was teamed up with catcher Charlie Ganzel, and the pair became known as 
the "Pretzel Battery" because of their shared German ethnicity.[24][25] 
When Getzein signed with Boston in 1890, he was reunited with Ganzel. The 
Sporting Life reported: "The signing of Getzein by the Boston League Club 
re-unites the famous 'Pretzel Battery,' Getzein and Ganzel, of the Detroit 
ex-champions."[26] Getzein began the 1891 season with Boston, but he was 
released by the team on July 16, 1891, after compiling a 4–5 record in 
nine starts. He attempted a comeback with the Cleveland Spiders in August 1891,[27] 
but he appeared in only one game for the Spiders, allowing nine runs in 
nine innings. He concluded his major league career appearing in 13 games 
for the St. Louis Browns in 1892.[1] In 1894, Getzein was reported to be 
playing first base for a Chicago City League team.[28] During nine major 
league seasons, he compiled a 145–139 record and a 3.46 earned run average (ERA) 
in 296 games. He totaled 292 games started and threw 277 complete games,[1] 
a total that ranks 58th in major league history. Only three pitchers in 
major league history (Ed Morris, Mark Baldwin, and Hall of Famer Albert 
Spalding) threw more complete games in careers shorter than Getzein's nine-year 
career.[29] Getzein's record for complete games is based in part on the 
customs of the 1880s. In 1915, Baseball Magazine reported that managers 
were not allowed to freely pull the starting pitcher from a game in the 
bygone era. It cited an incident involving Getzein to illustrate the old 
practice: "The Nationals got onto Getzein in the fourth inning and batted 
him all over the field. In the fifth inning they kept up the slugging until 
Getzein said he was ill, and Manager Hanlon wanted the Nationals to allow 
Getzein to retire, claiming that he was too sick to play. Baker, captaining 
the home club, said he would call a doctor and have him examine Getzein, 
and if the latter was really sick he would probably allow the change to 
be made. Dr. Bond, who happened to be present, was called on, and he examined 
the pitcher, while the crowd guyed Getzein terribly. The doctor announced 
that he did not consider Getzein sick, only discouraged at the pounding 
he had received, and that he would be able to finish the game."[30] Getzien 
was married to Rose Dibble.[31] He died in June 1932 after suffering a 
heart attack at his home in Chicago.[32] He was buried at Concordia Cemetery
