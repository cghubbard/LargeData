Gregory Owen "Gregg" Zaun (/ˈzɔːn/; born April 14, 1971) is an American-Canadian 
baseball analyst, public speaker and a retired professional baseball catcher. 
He played for nine different teams over sixteen seasons in Major League 
Baseball from 1995 until 2010, winning a World Series Championship in 1997. 
Since 2006, he has served as an on-air personality with Sportsnet in Canada. 
Zaun, the nephew of former MLB catcher Rick Dempsey, was a high school 
teammate of Mark Loretta. Zaun and Loretta attended Saint Francis High 
School in La Cañada, California and graduated in 1989.[1] Drafted by the 
Baltimore Orioles in the 17th round of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft, 
Zaun reached the majors with the Orioles in June 1995. Used primarily as 
a back-up early in his career, he was traded to the Florida Marlins in 
1996. After winning a World Series with the Marlins in 1997, he moved to 
the Texas Rangers prior to the 1999 season. He has also played with the 
Kansas City Royals, Houston Astros, and Colorado Rockies. He signed as 
a free agent with the Blue Jays prior to the 2004 season. In 2004, the 
Blue Jays were the first team to make Zaun, at 33, a starting catcher. 
Valuable in the line-up as a switch-hitter, he set a career high in 2005 
with 133 games. Prior to the 2006 season, the Blue Jays signed Bengie Molina 
as the everyday catcher, making Zaun the backup. Zaun started 2006 on the 
disabled list, with Jason Phillips serving as Molina's backup during the 
first week of the year. Zaun hit a game-winning two-run homer off the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays' Jason Childers in his return on April 8. Molina's struggles 
against right-handed pitchers caused John Gibbons to platoon the two, with 
Molina generally starting against left-handed pitchers and Zaun playing 
against righties. On September 13, 2006, he hit home runs from both sides 
of the plate in the same game. He was only the 4th Blue Jay in history 
to do this. Because the Toronto Blue Jays actively pursued Rod Barajas 
of the Texas Rangers as the club's new starting catcher during the 2006 
offseason, it was assumed that Zaun would be exploring free agency as signing 
Barajas would mean Zaun would be maintained as a backup. Meanwhile, negotiations 
between Zaun and the club deteriorated, as Zaun claimed that the Jays offered 
"slightly better than back-up money for playing every day".[2] Negotiations 
with Barajas went as far as an offer conditional on a routine physical, 
but eventually fell apart for undisclosed reasons. After turning down a 
reported $6.5 million two-year offer from the Blue Jays a week earlier,[3] 
Zaun officially accepted a two-year, $7.25 million contract offer to return 
to the Toronto Blue Jays as their starting catcher on November 28, 2006. 
The new contract deal also included a third-year option, guaranteed based 
on appearances.[4] The signing came after Zaun was rumored to have been 
courted by the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees, both in backup roles. 
Arguably his most famous play with the Jays was hitting a game-winning 
grand slam in the bottom of the 13th inning off of Tampa Bay Rays closer 
Troy Percival, on September 6, 2008 with two outs in the inning, wiping 
out the Rays, 7–4. [1] Zaun hit only the second game-winning grand slam 
in Jays history but it was the first that occurred in extra innings, and 
even more spectacular was that his team was losing at the time, due to 
an RBI single by Dioner Navarro to put the Rays up, 4–3, before the slam 
at the top of the 13th. On January 22, 2009, Zaun signed a one-year deal 
with the Baltimore Orioles.[5] Zaun was claimed off waivers by the Tampa 
Bay Rays GM Andrew Friedman in exchange for Rhyne Hughes on August 7, 2009. 
On August 16, Zaun hit a pinch hit grand slam home run against his old 
team the Blue Jays in the 8th inning off Brandon League on a 3–2 fastball. 
On November 12, 2009, Zaun was granted Free Agency. On December 4, 2009, 
Zaun signed a one-year contract with the Milwaukee Brewers for $1.9 million. 
After suffering a severe injury, Zaun's 2010 season—and, as it turned out, 
his MLB career, ended on May 20. After the season, Milwaukee declined his 
contract option, and he became a free agent on November 2. In January, 
Zaun signed a minor league deal with the San Diego Padres, with an invitation 
to spring training.[6] However, noting that he still had not recovered 
from his previous injury enough to play regularly, he chose to retire on 
March 7, 2011.[7] In 2009, Zaun was included in the Mitchell Report following 
a 20-month investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs by 
former Senator George Mitchell. In the report, Kirk Radomski claimed he 
sold Deca-Durabolin and Winstrol to Zaun in 2001, after a referral from 
Jason Grimsley. Radomski produced a cheque from Zaun for $500. Mitchell 
also explained that former Montreal Expos bullpen catcher Luis Perez claimed 
to have supplied Zaun with steroids in 2002. Zaun declined to be interviewed 
for the report.[8] Zaun started his broadcasting career after the Blue 
Jays closed out their 2006 season. Throughout the playoffs, Zaun would 
offer his thoughts on how the teams and players were doing, and how he 
thought they could improve. He worked alongside Jamie Campbell on Rogers 
Sportsnet. He has continued to work on Sportsnet's post-season broadcast 
through 2013. After his retirement, on March 14, 2011 Zaun signed a two-year 
contract with Rogers Sportsnet to become their studio MLB analyst.[9] He 
also serves as a part-time analyst on Sportsnet Radio Fan 590 and the Blue 
Jays Radio Network. As part of his duties he blogs on his website 'zauntourage.com'.[10] 
On May 10–11, 2011 Zaun filled in as the color commentator on the NESN 
broadcast of a Red Sox series against the Blue Jays when the normal broadcaster, 
Jerry Remy was ill.[11] He now does the Sportsnet pre-game show for the
