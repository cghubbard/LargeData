Andrew "Andy" Pafko (February 25, 1921 – October 8, 2013) was an American 
and former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the Chicago Cubs (1943–51), Brooklyn Dodgers (1951–52), and Milwaukee 
Braves (1953–59). He batted and threw right-handed and played center field. 
Pafko was born in Boyceville, Wisconsin.[1] In his 17-year MLB career, 
he was an All-Star for four seasons[a] and was a .285 hitter with 213 home 
runs and 976 RBI, in 1852 games.[2] In 1999, he was named to the Chicago 
Cubs All-Century Team. Pafko grew up in Boyceville, Wisconsin.[3] The small 
village did not have a baseball team.[3] Pafko was signed as a 19-year-old 
by the Class D baseball team in nearby Eau Claire.[3] Pafko learned about 
the interest from team manager Ivy Griffin while working on his father's 
farm. "I still remember the day he pulled into the driveway at the farm 
in that nice new car", Pafko said. "It took me about five minutes to get 
off the threshing machine and change my clothes. I was gone."[3] In 1941, 
Pafko played on the Green Bay Blue Sox team in the Wisconsin State League.[3] 
He had 12 home runs, 66 RBIs, while batting .349 on the team that won the 
league championship.[3] He played another season in the minor league before 
debuting in the major league in 1943 with the Chicago Cubs.[3] Nicknamed 
"Handy Andy", Pafko was a popular player well known for good hitting and 
fielding, and contributed to championship-caliber teams in three different 
cities. He played for the Chicago Cubs during their 1945 World Series appearance. 
After Cubs third baseman Stan Hack retired the following year, Pafko replaced 
him at third base long enough to be almost named an All-Star there. MLB 
cancelled the All-Star Game and selection that season due to the war and 
the Associated Press sportswriters named Pafko as one of their All-Stars. 
Pafko did become a four time consecutive All-Star from 1947 through 1950, 
making him one of the few players to achieve All-Star status in both the 
infield and outfield. Pafko was traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers in June 
1951 during the middle of the season.[3] Pafko returned home when he was 
traded to the Boston Braves before the start of the 1953 season, becoming 
the only Wisconsin native on the Braves roster when they arrived in Milwaukee 
and participating in their strong contending teams there, including the 
1957 World Series champions.[3] Pafko started in the first game at Milwaukee 
County Stadium on April 3, 1953.[3] A devout Slovak Lutheran, he was an 
instant favorite with Milwaukee's large Eastern European community.[3] 
In the mid 1950s, the Milwaukee area Lutherans had an "Andy Pafko Night" 
and gave him a new car.[3] After playing in the major leagues, Pafko managed 
in the minor leagues,[3] including a two-year stint as the skipper for 
the Kinston Eagles in the Carolina League. Pafko also scouted for the Montreal 
Royals in the late 1960s.[2] He was also active in the Milwaukee Braves 
Historical Association.[4] He eventually settled in the Chicago area,[3] 
and always provided good copy for the press, especially when the subject 
of the Cubs would come up. When the Cubs won their division in 1984, Pafko 
mused, "I never dreamed it would take them 39 years to win again. I thought 
they would have won by accident before then!" Pafko was named to the Cubs 
All-Century team at the turn of the 21st century. As of July 2013, Pafko 
and Lennie Merullo (died May 30, 2015) were the last two men living who 
played for the Cubs in a World Series. The book Carl Erskine's Tales from 
the Dodgers Dugout: Extra Innings (2004) includes short stories from former 
Dodger pitcher Carl Erskine. Pafko is prominent in many of these stories. 
He is also the title character in Pafko at the Wall and The Perfect Pafko. 
He also plays a role in Roger Kahn's American classic, "The Boys of Summer."[5] 
Pafco died at a nursing home in Stevensville, Michigan on October 8, 2013.
