Carney Ray Lansford (born February 7, 1957) is a former third baseman in 
Major League Baseball and former hitting coach of the Colorado Rockies. 
Lansford, who played for the California Angels (1978–80), Boston Red Sox 
(1981–82) and Oakland Athletics (1983–92), batted and threw right-handed. 
Originally drafted by the California Angels in the 3rd round of the 1975 
Major League Baseball draft, Lansford was the Angels' most successful rookie 
in 1978 and finished third in the overall AL Rookie of the Year vote. The 
Angels dealt Lansford to the Red Sox after the 1980 season. In 1981, he 
won the American League batting title in the strike-shortened season, becoming 
the league's first right-handed hitter to do so in 11 years. However, the 
emergence of Wade Boggs resulted in the Red Sox sending Lansford to Oakland[citation 
needed] in a trade involving Tony Armas during the 1982 off-season. Lansford 
became the A's regular third baseman and was there for their 1988 through 
1992 dynasty, typically hitting second behind Rickey Henderson. Lansford 
narrowly missed winning his second batting title in 1989 with a .336 average 
(Minnesota's Kirby Puckett finished with a .339 average). Although his 
power numbers dropped off during those years, and he missed almost all 
the 1991 season with an injury, Lansford's speed and solid hitting made 
him a significant contributor to the A's dynasty. He played in three World 
Series with the A's, losing in 1988 and 1990 and winning in 1989. In his 
15-year career, Lansford was a .290 hitter with 151 home runs, 874 RBI, 
and 224 stolen bases in 1862 games. Lansford was a hitting coach for the 
San Francisco Giants during the 2008 and 2009 seasons. Lansford was relieved 
of his duties following the 2009 season.[1] Lansford was hired by the Rockies 
for the 2011 season.[2] Lansford had a cameo role as Kit "Hit or Die" Kesey, 
the Chicago White Sox batter that Mel Clark (played by Tony Danza) retires 
for the final out in the Angels' pennant-winning game in the 1994 remake 
of Angels in the Outfield. He is a direct descendant of Sir Francis Drake. 
His son, Jared, was drafted by Oakland in the second round of the 2005 
amateur draft. His other son, Josh, was a third baseman in the Chicago 
Cubs minor league system. His brother, Jody Lansford, spent nine seasons 
in the minor leagues, briefly breaking into the big leagues with the San 
Diego Padres, for whom he recorded 30 at bats in parts of two seasons, 
with one career home run.[3] He played for the Briarwood Little League 
team, from Santa Clara, California, which made it to the finals of the 
1969 Little League World Series. In the final game of the World Series 
on August 2, Carney's team was defeated 5-0 by the team from Taipei City, 
Taiwan. Lansford is one of fewer than a dozen men who have played in both 
the Little League World Series and the MLB World Series.[4] Lansford went 
to Wilcox High School in Santa Clara, California, and due to his success,
