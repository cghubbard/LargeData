"One Moment in Time" is a worldwide hit Emmy Award winning[1] song written 
by Albert Hammond and John Bettis, produced by Narada Michael Walden and 
recorded by American singer Whitney Houston for the 1988 Summer Olympics 
and the 1988 Summer Paralympics held in Seoul, South Korea. The song was 
Houston's third number one in the UK Singles Chart, and reached number 
five on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song's melody was inspired by the 
timeless figure of Elvis Presley, with Hammond imagining it as being sung 
by Presley at the opening of the Olympics. It appeared on the album 1988 
Summer Olympics Album: One Moment in Time, produced in conjunction with 
NBC Sports' coverage of the Seoul games and which, in addition to Whitney 
Houston who sang it live at the main ceremony, also featured artists such 
as: The Four Tops, The Bee Gees, Eric Carmen, Taylor Dayne and the film 
composer John Williams. The track is an anthem for believing in yourself 
against all odds as Houston asks for "One moment in time/when I'm racing 
with destiny/Then, in that one moment of time, I will feel eternity." The 
video for the song does not show Houston performing the song but is a basic 
collage of clips from previous Olympic ceremonies. It opens with footage 
of Olympic games from 1924 and 1964 until the lighting of the cauldron 
from the 1988 games is shown which fades from black and white to color. 
As the song plays throughout, footage from the games in 1988 and 1984 are 
shown. When the chorus is sung for the last time, midway through it, scenes 
of the awarding from 1984 and 1988 are shown. The song video ends with 
the 1988 Olympic Cauldron blazing. "One Moment in Time" was released by 
Arista Records in August 1988 as the first single from The 1988 Summer 
Olympics Album: One Moment in Time, the soundtrack to the Games in Seoul, 
South Korea.[2] The song debuted at number 57 on the Billboard Hot 100, 
the issue dated September 10, 1988.[3] Nine weeks later, it peaked at number 
five on the chart, the issue date of November 12, 1988, becoming Houston's 
tenth top 10 hit on the Hot 100, and spent 17 weeks on the chart.[4] It 
also debuted on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (formerly "Hot Black 
Singles") at number 78, the issue dated September 17, 1988, and six weeks 
later reached a peak of 22, her lowest position on the R&B chart at the 
time.[5] On the issue date of November 5, 1988, the single peaked at number 
one on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary chart, making it her seventh 
number-one single on the chart, and stayed on the top for two weeks.[6][7] 
It ranked number 89 on the Billboard Hot 100 Year-End chart of 1988.[8] 
Worldwide, it was a big hit. In the United Kingdom, the song entered the 
UK Singles Chart at number 24, the week ending date of September 24, 1988, 
and within four weeks of its release reached the top position, a peak it 
maintained for two weeks, becoming Houston's third UK number-one single.[9][10] 
The single was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) 
for shipments of 200,000 copies on October 1, 1988.[11] According to The 
Official Charts Company, the single has sold 400,000 copies in the country.[12] 
In Germany, it debuted at number 58 on the Media Control Top 100 Singles 
chart, the week dated September 26, 1988, and the following week went straight 
into the top ten.[13] On October 24, 1988, the fifth week of its release, 
the song reached number one on the chart and stayed there for two weeks, 
making it her second German number-one hit.[14] The single was certified 
Gold for shipments of 250,000 copies or more by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie 
(BVMI) in 1988.[15] Across Europe, "One Moment in Time" was successful, 
topping the European Hot 100 Singles chart for five weeks. It peaked inside 
the top five in Austria,[16] Belgium,[17] Italy,[18] Norway,[19] Sweden,[20] 
and Switzerland,[21] and reached top ten in France[22] and the Netherlands.[23] 
But the single became a minor hit in Oceania region, peaking at number 
53 and 34 on the singles chart, in Australia and New Zealand, respectively.[24][25] 
The song re-entered the UK Singles Chart for week ending February 18, 2012 
following Houston's death.[26] Also following Houston's death, Entertainment 
Weekly published a list of her 25 best songs and ranked it #14 because: 
"The Seoul Olympics needed an anthem, and Houston rose to meet the challenge 
with this majestic carpe diem chest-thumper. The song, a staple of sports 
montages, yielded one of Houston's all-time best performances at the 1989 
Grammys ceremony."[27] A British pop group, The Shadows did an instrumental 
version on their 1989 album, Steppin' to the Shadows: 16 Great Tracks As 
Only the Shadows Can Play Them.[35] In 2010, Leapy Lee released a new version 
of "One Moment in Time" on Little Arrows II, his first recording since 
1970.[36] The song was played during a montage of highlights at the end 
of NBC Sports' coverage of the 1988 World Series after the Los Angeles 
Dodgers defeated the Oakland Athletics four games to one. The song was 
also played during the 1995 Baltimore Orioles game when Cal Ripken broke 
Lou Gehrig's consecutive played games record. Appropriately for the song's 
origins as an Olympic anthem, Olympic gold medal-winning heptathlete Denise 
Lewis selected the song as one of her eight Desert Island Discs in February 
2012. That same month, the song featured at the beginning of the 2012 Brit 
Awards at London's O2 Arena in tribute to Houston who had died earlier 
in the month by playing the song accompanied with a 30-second-video montage
