The Philadelphia Phillies have completed 131 seasons in Major League Baseball 
since their inception in 1883. Through 2013, they have played 19,052 regular 
season games, winning 9,035 and losing 10,162, for a winning percentage 
of .471. The Phillies have also a combined record of 49—55 (.471) in post-season 
play.[1] This list documents the season-by-season records of the Phillies’ 
franchise including their year as the “Quakers” and the years where they 
shared the names “Quakers” and “Phillies.” The team was formed in the National 
League after the dissolution of the Worcester baseball franchise at the 
end of 1882, though there is no additional connection between the teams.[2] 
At times, the Phillies’ search for success has been seen as an exercise 
in futility,[3][4] because of their long stretches of losing seasons,[5] 
including sixteen consecutive from 1933 through 1948.[6] However, the Phillies 
do own seven National League pennants, won in 1915, 1950, 1980, 1983, 1993, 
2008, and 2009, as well as championships in the 1980 and 2008 World Series. 
Compared to the team's early days, the Phillies have recently been more 
successful than not, with two periods of extended success: the first from 
1975 to 1983, when they won five East Division championships as well as 
the first-half championship in the strike-shortened 1981 season,[5] and 
the second starting in 2001, with a winning percentage of .540 over those 
nine seasons, finishing above .500 in all but one, and making the playoffs 
from 2007 to 2011. During their record-setting streak of sixteen consecutive 
losing seasons, the Phillies posted their franchise record for losses in 
a season in 1941 with 111,[7] falling shy of the modern (post-dead-ball 
era) Major League record of 120 losses in a season.[8][9] During the 2007 
season, the franchise also became the first professional sports team in 
American history to reach 10,000 losses.[10] The Phillies have thrice surpassed 
the century mark for wins in a season: in 1976 with 101 wins,[11] when 
they made their first playoff appearance in twenty-six seasons; again the 
next season when they matched that mark;[12] and in 2011, when they set 
the franchise single-season record for wins with 102 victories and clinched 
a playoff position at the earliest point in team history.[13][14] Philadelphia 
finished the 2010 season with a record of 97–65, marking the first time 
that the team completed a season with Major League Baseball’s best record;[15] 
they duplicated this accomplishment in 2011 as the majors' only 100-win 
team.[14] Since 2011, the Phillies have declined again and in 2015 they 
suffered the worst record in MLB and the franchise’s worst since an equally-poor 
record in 1969, with their worst before than from 1961. Eddie Sawyer (MOY)[g][17]
