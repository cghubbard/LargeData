George W. Shafer [sometimes spelled Shaffer or Schaefer[1]] (October 1851 
– January 21, 1922) was an outfielder in Major League Baseball. Nicknamed 
"Orator", because he was an avid speaker, Shafer played for 10 teams in 
four different major leagues between 1874 and 1890. Though he was a good 
hitter who batted over .300 three times, Shafer was best known for his 
defensive abilities. He led the National League's outfielders in assists 
four times. In 1879, he set an MLB single-season record with 50 outfield 
assists, which is a mark that has stood for over 130 years. He was considered 
by some to be the greatest right fielder of his era. Shafer was 5 feet 
9 inches (1.75 m) tall and weighed 165 pounds (75 kg).[2] Shafer was born 
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1851.[2] He was a "promising young Philadelphia 
amateur"[3] before starting his professional baseball career in 1874 in 
the National Association.[2] That year, he played in nine games for the 
Hartford Dark Blues and in one game for the New York Mutuals, with a cumulative 
batting average of .225. His fielding percentage was a career-low .710. 
The following season, he played 19 games for the Philadelphia Whites and 
batted .243.[2] Shafer was known during his playing career by the nickname 
"Orator". According to Alfred Henry Spink, founder of The Sporting News, 
he received the nickname because he "was a great stickler for his rights 
and talked to himself when not talking to the Umpire."[1][4] Another player 
of the era, future Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Orator Jim O'Rourke, 
shared the same nickname.[5] Shafer joined the National League's Louisville 
Grays in 1877. He earned a job as the team's starting right fielder, and 
he led the league in games played (61), outfield assists (21), and outfield 
errors (28). He also batted .285 and had the second-most home runs in the 
league with three.[2] (Lip Pike had four homers.)[6] In 1878, Shafer had 
one of his best seasons at the plate for the Indianapolis Blues. He batted 
.338 to finish sixth in the batting race and also ranked among the league 
leaders in on-base percentage (third), slugging percentage (third), and 
total bases (fourth). His OPS+ total of 186 led the league, and his 3.8 
wins above replacement was the highest among all position players. Shafer 
also had 28 assists in the outfield.[2] In 1879, Shafer signed with Cap 
Anson's Chicago White Stockings. However, he had left Indianapolis the 
previous year with some unpaid debts. The White Stockings traveled to Indianapolis 
to play an exhibition game in June, and the local sheriff was waiting for 
both him and teammate Silver Flint. After the game, Shafer and Flint escaped 
the ballpark in a horse-drawn carriage to avoid arrest, and only their 
manager, Anson, was taken to jail.[7] Shafer batted .304 for Chicago in 
1879 and also set a career high by getting 50 assists.[2] The 50 outfield 
assists was 20 more than any other NL player and established a major league 
record that has never been broken.[8] In 1880, Shafer joined the Cleveland 
Blues and was their regular right fielder for the next three seasons. He 
continued his good hitting and fielding during his first year with the 
club, batting .266 with an OPS+ of 125 and leading the league again with 
35 assists. However, his batting average dropped to .257 the following 
season and then to .214 in 1882. His fielding percentage dropped as well, 
from .901 in 1880 (fourth in the league) to .805 in 1882.[2] Shafer played 
for the Buffalo Bisons in 1883. He batted .292 and led the NL in outfield 
assists for the fourth and final time, with 41.[2] He then signed with 
the St. Louis Maroons in the new Union Association for the 1884 season.[9] 
Playing in a career-high 106 games in 1884, Shafer also batted a career-high 
.360 and was one of the best hitters in the UA.[2] He led the league with 
40 doubles, and he finished second only to teammate Fred Dunlap in several 
other offensive categories, including batting average, on-base percentage 
(.398), slugging percentage (.501), runs scored (130), hits (168), and 
total bases (234).[10] The Maroons went 94–19 and finished first in the 
Union Association.[11] Shafer stayed with St. Louis as they moved to the 
National League in 1885; his batting average fell to .195. The following 
season, he played 21 games for the American Association's Philadelphia 
Athletics, hit .268,[2] and then spent the next few years in the minor 
leagues. In 1887, he played for Lincoln of the Western League until he 
was suspended in September for punching an umpire in the face.[12] Shafer 
moved on to the Western Association's Des Moines team in 1888, and he played 
well, batting .338 and leading the league in hits.[13] In 1889, he was 
the captain of the Detroit Wolverines, which won the International League 
championship.[14] Shafer then rejoined the Philadelphia Athletics in 1890.[15] 
In his final major league season, he played in 100 games, batted .282, 
and led the AA's outfielders with a .958 fielding percentage. He was the 
second-oldest player in the league, at 38 years old.[2] Shafer's younger 
brother, Taylor, also played for the 1890 Athletics.[16] Over his 13-season 
Major League Baseball career, Orator Shafer played a total of 871 games. 
He had 1,000 hits in 3,552 at bats, a .282 batting average, 11 home runs, 
601 runs scored, and 317 runs batted in.[2] He also had 290 career outfield 
assists, which is the 10th highest total in MLB history.[17] Shafer was 
an outstanding fielder.[18] Fellow major league right fielder Paul Radford, 
when writing about how to play the position, said: "I always considered 
'Orator' Shaffer a splendid right fielder, because of his skill in throwing 
out men at the initial bag. I know he threw me out thus in two successive 
games at Buffalo."[19] According to The Sporting Life, Shafer "was for 
years considered the best man in his position."[13] In 2001, statistician 
Bill James ranked Shafer as the 99th greatest right fielder of all-time.[20] 
After his baseball career ended, Shafer worked at a race track as a book-writer.[21] 
He died in Philadelphia in 1922 and was buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery
