The Chicago White Sox is a U.S. professional baseball team based in Chicago, 
Illinois. The White Sox are members of the American League Central Division 
in Major League Baseball. In baseball, the head coach of a team is called 
the manager, or more formally, the field manager. The duties of the team 
manager include team strategy and leadership on and off the field.[1][2] 
Since the inception of the team in 1901, it has employed 39 different managers.[3] 
The White Sox's last manager was Robin Ventura, who was hired after the 
2011 season and fired at the end of the 2016 season.[4] Former Chicago 
Cubs manager Rick Renteria was named the Chicago White Sox's 40th manager 
on October 3rd, 2016. The franchise's first manager was Hall of Famer Clark 
Griffith, who managed the team for two seasons and led them to the American 
League championship in their inaugural season.[3][5][6] Fielder Jones, 
who managed the team from 1904 to 1908, led the team to its second American 
League championship and its first World Series championship (no World Series 
was played in 1901), defeating the White Sox's crosstown rivals, the Chicago 
Cubs, in the 1906 World Series.[7][8] Pants Rowland and Kid Gleason managed 
the White Sox to American League championships in 1917 and 1919, respectively, 
with the White Sox winning the 1917 World Series but losing the 1919 World 
Series in the infamous Black Sox scandal.[9][10][11][12] The White Sox 
did not win another American League championship until 1959, with Al Lopez 
as their manager.[6] The White Sox lost the 1959 World Series to the Los 
Angeles Dodgers.[13][14] The White Sox next captured the American League 
pennant in 2005 and, with Ozzie Guillén as their manager, defeated the 
Houston Astros in the 2005 World Series.[6][15][16] The longest–tenured 
White Sox manager was Jimmy Dykes, who managed the team for 1,850 games 
from 1934 to 1946.[3] The only other White Sox managers who have managed 
more than 1,000 games are Lopez with 1,495, Guillén with 1,135, and Tony 
La Russa with 1,035.[3] Dykes' 899 wins and 940 losses also lead all White 
Sox managers.[3] Jones' winning percentage of .592 is the highest of any 
White Sox manager.[3] Five White Sox managers have served multiple terms 
managing the team. Nixey Callahan was the White Sox manager in 1903 and 
part of 1904, and then again from 1912 to 1914.[3] Johnny Evers served 
two terms as manager, separated by a bout of appendicitis in 1924.[17][18] 
Eddie Collins served as interim manager for 27 games in 1924 season while 
Evers was ill and then served as the full–time manager in 1925 and 1926.[19] 
Lopez served three terms as manager: the first from 1957 to 1965; then 
for 11 games during the 1968 season, before being hospitalized with appendicitis; 
and then returning for another 53 games from the end of the 1968 season 
through the beginning of the 1969 season.[13][20][21] Les Moss served as 
interim manager for two games in 1968, replacing Eddie Stanky before being 
replaced by Lopez.[22][23] After Lopez was hospitalized later that season, 
Moss took over as manager again for 34 games before Lopez returned.[20][22][23] 
Hall of Famer Frank Chance was hired to manage the team for the 1924 but 
illness forced him to retire before managing any games.[24][25] Ten Hall 
of Famers have managed the White Sox: Griffith, Hugh Duffy, Collins, Evers, 
Ed Walsh, Ray Schalk, Ted Lyons, Lopez, Bob Lemon and Larry Doby.[26][27] 
Lopez was elected as a manager; the others were elected as players.[13][27]
