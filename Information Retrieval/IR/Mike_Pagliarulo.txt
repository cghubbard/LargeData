Michael Timothy Pagliarulo, aka "Pags" (born March 15, 1960), is an American 
former professional baseball third baseman who played during the 1980s 
and into the mid-1990s. He played in Major League Baseball for the New 
York Yankees, San Diego Padres, Minnesota Twins, Baltimore Orioles, and 
Texas Rangers, and in Nippon Professional Baseball for the Seibu Lions. 
Pagliarulo played college baseball at the University of Miami for the Miami 
Hurricanes, and was drafted by the New York Yankees in sixth round of the 
1981 Major League Baseball draft. Pagliarulo joined the parent club on 
July 1, 1984, and spent just over five years with the Yankees before going 
to the San Diego Padres in 1989. After a year and a half in San Diego, 
Pagliarulo moved back to the American League when he joined the Minnesota 
Twins just before the start of the 1991 season. It was with Minnesota that 
Pagliarulo won his only World Series championship as the starting third 
baseman in 1991. Pagliarulo remained with Minnesota for the following 1992 
season and part of the 1993 season before going to the Baltimore Orioles, 
where he finished the season. Pagliarulo was out of Major League Baseball 
during the strike-shortened 1994 season, playing the season for the Japanese 
league's Seibu Lions, where he was a teammate of current Lions manager 
Tsutomu Ito. He played college baseball at the University of Miami. At 
the age of 35, Pagliarulo resumed his career when he signed with the Texas 
Rangers, where he finished his career before retiring after the 1995 season. 
In 2014, he served as the hitting coach of the Indianapolis Indians, the 
AAA affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates.[1] His son, Michael, was a member 
of the 2009 Ivy League champion Dartmouth Big Green baseball team.[2] Pagliarulo's 
name is pronounced "pah-lee-ah-ROO-low". Fellow Italian-American Yankees 
announcer Phil Rizzuto was notably insistent upon this pronunciation.[citation
