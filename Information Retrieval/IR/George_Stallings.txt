As player As manager George Tweedy Stallings (November 17, 1867 – May 13, 
1929) was an American manager and (briefly) player in Major League Baseball. 
His most famous achievement – leading the 1914 Boston Braves from last 
place in mid-July to the National League championship and a World Series 
sweep of the powerful Philadelphia Athletics – resulted in a nickname he 
would bear for the rest of his life: "The Miracle Man."[1] He was born 
on November 17, 1867 in Atlanta. Stallings graduated from the Virginia 
Military Institute in 1886. He entered medical school, but was instead 
offered a contract by Harry Wright, manager of the Philadelphia Phillies. 
He was cut in spring training. Stallings was a mediocre player: he appeared 
in only seven major league games as a catcher, first baseman and outfielder 
with Brooklyn (1890) and the Phillies (1897–98) and had only two hits in 
20 at-bats, hitting a weak .100. As a manager, he had a mixed major league 
resume prior to 1914: a poor record with the Phillies (1897–98), then mild 
successes in the American League with the Detroit Tigers (1901) and New 
York Highlanders (1909–10). In the minor leagues, he managed the 1895 Nashville 
Seraphs to win the Southern League pennant; he also played an infield position 
on the team.[2] He also managed Detroit before it became a major league 
team in part of 1896 and from the end of 1898 through its becoming a charter 
member of the American League. Named manager of the last-place Braves after 
the 1912 season, Stallings raised Boston to fifth place in the NL in his 
first season, 1913, but the Braves were sunk at the bottom of the eight-team 
league and 11½ games from the frontrunning New York Giants on July 15, 
1914 when they began their meteoric rise.[3] With Stallings expertly handling 
a roster of light hitters (Boston hit only .251 as a team) and relying 
on pitchers Dick Rudolph and Bill James (who each won 26 games), the Braves 
won 52 of their final 66 contests to overtake the other seven National 
League teams and finish 10½ games in front of the second-place Giants.[4] 
They then defeated the heavily favored Philadelphia Athletics in four straight 
games to earn the nickname "Miracle Braves."[5][6] Stallings is credited 
with being the first manager to use platooning to good effect.[7] It was 
not strictly left/right hand platooning (there were then relatively few 
southpaw pitchers), but he did change his lineup significantly when the 
Braves played a team starting a left-handed pitcher. Bill James credits 
him with being the first major league manager to use platooning as a weapon, 
rather than to cover a hitter's weaknesses. The 1914 championship was the 
only World Series title earned by the Braves during their tenure in Boston, 
which lasted through March 1953. It also was Stallings’ first and only 
big league championship. He managed the Braves through 1920, but posted 
no winning season after 1916. His career major league managing record was 
879 wins, 898 losses (.495) over 13 years. Stallings was responsible for 
bringing professional baseball back to the city of Montreal, Quebec. In 
1928, his partnership with Montreal lawyer and politician Athanase David 
and businessman Ernest Savard resurrected the Montreal Royals as part of 
the International League. They built the modern new Delorimier Stadium 
in downtown Montreal as the home for the team that would be where Jackie 
Robinson would break the baseball color barrier in 1946. Stallings was 
famous for his superstitions, and for his nervousness on the bench. He 
has been described as both "distinguished" and salty-tongued. He died in 
Haddock, Georgia at age 61 of heart disease. According to legend, when 
asked by his physician why he had a bad heart, Stallings replied, "Bases
