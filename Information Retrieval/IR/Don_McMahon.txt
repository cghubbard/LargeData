Donald John McMahon (January 4, 1930 – July 22, 1987) was a right-handed 
relief pitcher in Major League Baseball. Born in Brooklyn, New York, he 
was signed by the Boston Braves before the 1950 season. He played for the 
Milwaukee Braves (1957–62), Houston Colt .45s (1962–63), Cleveland Indians 
(1964–66), Boston Red Sox (1966–67), Chicago White Sox (1967–68), Detroit 
Tigers (1968–69), and San Francisco Giants (1969–74). McMahon was used 
almost exclusively in relief during his 18-year MLB career. He appeared 
in 874 games, just two as a starter, and was one of the major leagues' 
busiest and most dependable relievers during his era. He never once spent 
time on the disabled list, and in the fifteen full seasons that he played 
(1958–72), he averaged about 54 games and 81 innings pitched per year. 
He reached the big leagues at the advanced age of 27 after playing minor 
league ball for about 5½ years and also spending two years in the military 
(May 30, 1951 – May 17, 1953). He appeared in his final game on June 29, 
1974, nearly 17 years after his major league debut. McMahon was a valuable 
part of two World Championship clubs—the 1957 Milwaukee Braves and the 
1968 Detroit Tigers. He posted a 1.54 ERA with 9 saves in 32 games for 
the 1957 Braves, and a 2.02 ERA with a 3–1 record in 20 games for the 1968 
Tigers after a mid-season trade from the White Sox. All together he pitched 
in three World Series and one National League Championship Series. He finished 
in the American League or National League top ten seven times for games 
pitched, seven times for saves, eight times for games finished, and once 
each for wild pitches, hit batsmen, and winning percentage. He recorded 
his 1000th strikeout at the age of 44 on May 27, 1974 on All-Star shortstop 
Don Kessinger of the Chicago Cubs. A little more than a month later, when 
McMahon retired, only Hoyt Wilhelm, Lindy McDaniel, and Cy Young had pitched 
in more games. For his career he finished with a lifetime record of 90–68, 
153 saves, 506 games finished, and an earned run average of 2.96. As of 
the conclusion of the 2006 season, McMahon ranked 17th all-time for fewest 
hits allowed per 9 innings pitched (7.24). Other career highlights include: 
In a 1976 Esquire magazine article, sportswriter Harry Stein published 
an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter", consisting of five ethnic baseball 
teams. Because of space limitations the Irish team, including McMahon as 
relief pitcher, was omitted. McMahon served as Giants pitching coach from 
1972 to 1975, and also from 1980 to 1982. He was activated by San Francisco 
for parts of the 1972, 1973 and 1974 seasons when the Giants needed his 
experienced and effective arm to help out in the bullpen. (Relievers Elías 
Sosa and Randy Moffitt were shouldering most of the load, and were not 
getting enough help from the others.) He also was the pitching coach of 
the Minnesota Twins from 1976 to 1977 and the Cleveland Indians from 1983 
to 1985. In 1986, after a recommendation from friend and fellow high school 
classmate Al Davis, he was hired as a scout for the LA Dodgers.[1][2] In 
1987, he was working as an instructional coach and scout with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers and pitched batting practice before most home games. On July 22, 
he was pitching batting practice when he suffered a heart attack, having 
undergone heart bypass surgery about three and a half years prior. McMahon 
died within hours.[3] He is buried at Good Shepherd Cemetery in Huntington
