Peter Gerard Richert (born October 29, 1939 in Floral Park, New York) is 
a former Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher. He pitched for the 
Los Angeles Dodgers (1962–64, 1972–73), Washington Senators (1965–67), 
Baltimore Orioles (1967–71), St. Louis Cardinals (1974) and Philadelphia 
Phillies (1974). In his Major league debut on April 12, 1962 against the 
Cincinnati Reds at Dodger Stadium, Richert set a record by striking out 
the first six batters he faced. He entered the game with two outs in the 
top of the second inning with his Dodgers trailing 4–0, and struck out 
Vada Pinson for the final out. Richert then recorded a four-strikeout third 
inning in which his victims were Frank Robinson (his future Oriole teammate), 
Gordy Coleman (who reached first base on a passed ball by Johnny Roseboro), 
Wally Post and Johnny Edwards; his record-tying sixth strikeout was of 
Tommy Harper leading off the fourth. As of 2015[update], Richert is the 
only pitcher to record a four-strikeout inning in his Major League debut. 
He also set a Major League record by retiring 12 consecutive batters, the 
most by a pitcher making his MLB debut as a reliever; Max Scherzer would 
break this record in 2008 by retiring 13 consecutive batters. Richert won 
the game in 3 1⁄3 innings of relief, giving up no hits or walks and striking 
out seven. That year, he went 5–4 as a spot starter in a rotation led by 
the future Hall-of-Fame duo of Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax. In 1963 he 
went 5–3 on a Dodger team that won the World Series; Richert did not pitch 
in the Series, which the Dodgers swept from the New York Yankees. After 
the 1964 season Richert, Frank Howard, Ken McMullen, Dick Nen and Phil 
Ortega were traded to the Washington Senators for fellow pitcher Claude 
Osteen, infielder John Kennedy and $100,000 cash. Richert's two full seasons 
with the Senators, 1965 and 1966, were the two best seasons of his career. 
In the former he won a career-high 15 games with a 2.60 earned run average, 
also a career high. In the latter he went 14–14 with a 3.37 ERA and set 
a career-high with 195 strikeouts. He struck out seven consecutive batters 
in an April 24 game against the Detroit Tigers in the latter year, but 
still lost, 4–0. Richert was also an All Star during both seasons and was 
the losing pitcher in the latter game, giving up a single to ex-Dodger 
teammate Maury Wills, which scored Tim McCarver for the winning run in 
the 10th inning. After going 2–6 to start the 1967 season Richert was traded 
to the Baltimore Orioles in the deal that sent Mike Epstein to Washington. 
Richert went 7–10 as an Oriole in this, his final season as a starter. 
In 1968 he went 6–3 with a 3.47 earned run average in his first season 
as a relief pitcher. Richert pitched on an Oriole team that played in three 
consecutive World Series from 1969 to 1971. In 1969 he went 7–4 with 12 
saves and a 2.20 ERA. The Orioles lost the World Series in surprising fashion 
to the New York Mets, and Richert was involved in a controversial play 
that ended Game Four. In the bottom of the tenth, with the game tied at 
1–1, J. C. Martin laid down a bunt and was hit by Richert's throw; the 
error allowed Rod Gaspar to score the winning run from second. Television 
replays later showed that Martin was running inside the baseline, which 
could have resulted in him being called out for interference.[citation

member of the World Championship Orioles team that year, the Orioles defeating 
the Cincinnati Reds in five games. Richert saved Game One of that Series 
in relief of Jim Palmer. During a 13-year baseball career, he compiled
