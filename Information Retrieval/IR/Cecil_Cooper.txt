Cecil Celester Cooper (born December 20, 1949), nicknamed "Coop", is a 
former first baseman in Major League Baseball and the former manager of 
the Houston Astros.[1] From 1971 through 1987, Cooper played for the Boston 
Red Sox (1971–76) and Milwaukee Brewers (1977–87). He batted and threw 
left-handed, and attended Prairie View A&M University in Prairie View, 
Texas. In a 17-season career, Cooper posted a .298 batting average with 
241 home runs and 1125 runs batted in in 1896 games. He was No. 17 with 
the Boston Red Sox, and No. 15 with the Milwaukee Brewers. Cooper was selected 
by the Boston Red Sox in the 1968 draft and made his Major League debut 
with the Red Sox in 1972. Before the 1977 season, he was sent to the Milwaukee 
Brewers in the same trade that brought George Scott back to Boston. A five-time 
All-Star, Cooper hit .300 or more from 1977 to 1983. His most productive 
season came in 1980, when he hit a career-high .352 (finishing second in 
the American League behind batting champion George Brett's .390 average 
for the Kansas City Royals), and he also led the league in RBIs (122) and 
total bases (335). In 1983 Cooper hit .307 with 30 home runs and a league-leading 
and career-high 126 RBIs. He also posted three seasons with 200-plus hits, 
in 1980, 1982 and 1983, finished fifth in the AL MVP vote, and was named 
the Brewers' team MVP in three seasons (1980, 1982–83). An excellent defensive 
first baseman, he was a two-time Gold Glove winner (1979–80). He also won 
the Silver Slugger Award in three straight years (1980–82); the only other 
Brewer to have done so is Ryan Braun (2008–10). Cooper concluded his Major 
League career with 11 seasons as a Brewer, including an appearance in the 
1982 World Series. Cooper holds the Milwaukee franchise records for hits 
(219 in 1980). Cooper held the team record for RBIs in a season with 126 
until Prince Fielder broke that record on September 19, 2009 against the 
Houston Astros, who Cooper was managing at the time. Through 2011 he was 
one of three Brewers who have had four 100-RBI seasons, along with Prince 
Fielder and Ryan Braun.[2] In 1983 he was honored with the Roberto Clemente 
Award, and in 2002 he was inducted into the Brewers Walk of Fame. Following 
the conclusion of his playing career, he worked in several capacities in 
the Brewers organization. He was named bench coach for Milwaukee in 2002 
and also managed the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians in 2003–04. He returned 
to the Major League coaching ranks in 2005 as a bench coach for the Houston 
Astros. On August 27, 2007, he was named the interim manager of the Astros 
following the firing of Phil Garner, making him the first African American 
field manager in Astros' history. Cooper's previous managerial experience 
was at Class AAA Indianapolis, the Milwaukee Brewers' top farm club. Cooper 
had a record of 130–156, finishing fourth in 2003 and third in 2004. On 
September 28, 2007, Cooper's interim tag was dropped and he became the 
Astros' 16th manager. Cooper was released as Astros manager on September 
21, 2009.[1] Cooper was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame 
in 2007. He lives now in Katy, Texas with his wife Octavia and daughter
