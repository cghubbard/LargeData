Canarsie (/kəˈnɑːrsi/ kə-NAR-see) is a working- and middle-class residential 
and commercial neighborhood in the southeastern portion of the borough 
of Brooklyn, in New York City, United States. Canarsie is bordered on the 
east by Fresh Creek Basin, East 108th Street, and the BMT Canarsie Line 
(L train); on the north by Linden Boulevard; on the west by Remsen Avenue 
to Ralph Avenue and the Paerdegat Basin; and on the south by Jamaica Bay. 
It is adjacent to the East Flatbush, Flatlands, Mill Basin, Bergen Beach, 
and East New York neighborhoods. The area is part of Brooklyn Community 
Board 18.[3] It is patrolled by the NYPD's 69th Precinct.[4] Canarsie is 
also served by Engine 257, Ladder 170 of the FDNY, and Station 58 of the 
FDNY Bureau of EMS. "Canarsie" is an adaptation to English phonology of 
a word in the Lenape language for "fenced land" or "fort". Europeans would 
often refer to the indigenous people living in an area by the local place-name, 
and so references may be found in contemporary documents to "Canarsee Indians". 
As of the 2010 United States Census, approximately 84,000 people reside 
in Canarsie.[5] The current neighborhood of Canarsie lies within the former 
town of Flatlands, one of the five original Dutch towns on Long Island. 
Canarsie was built on swamps near Jamaica Bay. It was a fishing village 
through the 1800s, until pollution contaminated the oysters[6][7][8][9] 
In the 1920s, Southern Italian immigrants along with Jews settled in the 
area, although the Jewish population in Canarsie in recent years has been 
steadily shrinking.[10] Ferry service at Canarsie Pier withered away after 
the building of the Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge.[11][12] 
Murphy's Carousel was created in 1912 by the Stein and Goldstein Artistic 
Carousell Co. of Brooklyn and installed in Golden City Park in Canarsie, 
on the Brooklyn waterfront, where it operated for 20 years. The New York 
Times notes: "The horses were carved in Coney Island style, which eschewed 
the look of docile ponies and prancing fillies and produced much more muscular, 
ferocious creatures with bared teeth and heads often lifted in motion."[13] 
In the spring of 1940,[14] when the Belt Parkway was planned in the area, 
the carousel was moved to Baldwin, on the border abutting Freeport, on 
Long Island.[13][15] "By way of Canarsie" was a mid-twentieth century American 
English figure of speech meaning "to come to one's destination by a roundabout 
way or from a distant point." It presumably arose when the Wilson Avenue 
Line was a principal route to Canarsie Landing. The expression has dropped 
from modern common parlance.[16] Based on data from the 2010 United States 
Census, the population of Canarsie was 83,693, a decrease of 1,365 (1.6%) 
from the 85,058 counted in 2000. Covering an area of 1,959.94 acres (793.16 ha), 
the neighborhood had a population density of 42.7 inhabitants per acre 
(27,300/sq mi; 10,600/km2).[2] The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 
81.0% (67,816) African American, 5.9% (4,928) White, 0.2% (192) Native 
American, 2.6% (2,198) Asian, 0.0% (8) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (332) from 
other races, and 1.5% (1,278) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino 
of any race were 8.3% (6,941) of the population.[17] During the 1990s, 
much of Canarsie's white population left for Staten Island, Long Island, 
Queens, and New Jersey, part of a national phenomenon referred to as "white 
flight" from the inner city to the suburbs.[18] Today, Canarsie's population 
is mostly black due to significant West Indian immigration in the area. 
East Brooklyn Community High School now serves the transfer student population.[19] 
At the southeast end of Canarsie is Canarsie Pier on Jamaica Bay, a fishing 
spot and recreation area. The pier is part of Gateway National Recreation 
Area, a unit of the National Park Service.[20] At the western end are mostly 
commercial warehouses and buildings. Canarsie has many one- and two-family 
homes, although there are two large public housing developments; NYCHA's 
"Breukelen" houses, and "Bayview" houses, and a number of small apartment 
buildings scattered throughout the neighborhood. The neighborhood has many 
parks, including a large one (over 100 acres (40 ha)) commonly referred 
to as Seaview Park, but officially named Canarsie Beach Park, which expanded 
to the southwest in 2007. The BMT Canarsie Line, on which the L train of 
the New York City Subway runs, has its terminal in Canarsie. MTA bus routes 
B6, B17, B42, B60, B82, B103, BM2 also run through Canarsie. The principal 
roadways through Canarsie are Rockaway Parkway and Flatlands Avenue. Canarsie 
is home to three high-school campuses, Canarsie Educational Campus, South 
Shore Educational Campus, and the newer East Brooklyn Community High School, 
as well as several junior high schools and elementary schools. In late 
fall 2006, Mayor Bloomberg announced that five troubled high schools would 
close by 2010:[21] Two were Canarsie's South Shore and Canarsie High School. 
According to a New York City Department of Education spokesperson, the 
closings were attributed to "dismal graduation rates, consistent low test 
scores, a poor history of educating, low performing students, and lackluster 
demand." Canarsie High School was phased out at the end of the 2010-2011 
school year. There are now three small schools operating in the Canarsie 
Educational Campus: High School for Medical Professions (HSMP), Innovation 
in Advertising and Media (IAM), and Urban Action Academy (UAA). These schools 
had their first graduating classes at the end of the 2011-12 school year. 
The Canarsie Courier, published every Thursday, is the oldest weekly publication 
in Brooklyn and is still in publication. It was founded by Walter S. Patrick 
on April 22, 1921. The Courier was then purchased by brothers Bob and Joe 
Samitz in 1959.[22] After the passing of Joe Samitz, Mary Samitz became 
co-publisher of the paper with her husband Bob and then became the sole 
publisher after he died. After his death in 1998, the Samitz family sold 
the paper to Donna Marra and Sandra Greco. Marra became the sole publisher 
in 2010. The newspaper's estimated circulation is fewer than 5,000, including 
paid, mailed subscriptions and subscribers to their website, as well as 
newsstand and over-the-counter sales. In addition to Canarsie, the Courier 
is distributed in various communities in southeast Brooklyn, such as Georgetown, 
East New York, Mill Basin, Bergen Beach, and Spring Creek, among others.[citation

readers a variety of features for the discriminating reader, plus local 
sports, culture news, guest columns, and opinion columns by in-house editors.[23]
