Kenneth Scott Rogers (born November 10, 1964 in Savannah, Georgia)[1] is 
a former American Major League Baseball (MLB) left-handed pitcher. During 
a 20-year baseball career, he pitched from 1989 to 2008 for six different 
teams. He won the 1996 World Series with the New York Yankees against his 
hometown team, the Atlanta Braves and played in the 2006 World Series with 
the Detroit Tigers. In addition to being known for his fielding (winning 
five Gold Glove Awards), he pitched the fourteenth perfect game in major 
league baseball history. In 2008, he was the oldest baseball player in 
the American League. Rogers is sometimes nicknamed "The Gambler", after 
a song made famous by a singer who shares his name. Rogers grew up on a 
15-acre (6.1 ha) farm in Dover, Florida. He, his wife Rebecca Lewis, and 
children Jessica and Trevor Rogers reside in Westlake, Texas. He enjoys 
golf, fishing, and building houses for Habitat for Humanity. Rogers was 
assigned to the Texas Rangers farm team after being drafted in the 39th 
round for $1,000 when he was 17 years old. He graduated from Plant City 
High School in Florida in 1982, where he played baseball only during his 
senior season, hitting .375 as a right fielder (he played shortstop in 
his senior league). He was converted into a pitcher on the strength of 
his throwing arm and left-handedness. Rogers spent seven years in the minor 
leagues before making it to the Rangers in 1989 as a reliever. He became 
a starting pitcher for the club in 1993. During his career, he played for 
the Texas Rangers (1989–95, 2000–02, 2004–05), the New York Yankees (1996–97), 
Oakland Athletics (1998–99), the New York Mets (1999), the Minnesota Twins 
(2003), and the Detroit Tigers (2006–08). With the Detroit Tigers in 2006, 
Rogers won 17 regular season games, and excelled in the post-season with 
23 straight scoreless innings over his three starts. He is one of only 
three pitchers in Rangers history through 2009 to win at least 17 games 
in 31 starts or fewer (17 wins in 31 starts in 1995), along with Scott 
Feldman (17 wins in 31 starts in 2009) and Ferguson Jenkins (18 wins in 
30 starts in 1978).[2] Rogers was acquired by the Oakland Athletics from 
the Yankees for third baseman Scott Brosius in Billy Beane's first trade 
as general manager.[3] Rogers led the Oakland pitching staff in his first 
season in innings (238.7) and wins (16). The next season, he started 19 
games, winning only 5 with a 4.30 ERA. He was traded at the deadline to 
the New York Mets for Terrence Long and a minor league player. During his 
short tenure with the New York Mets, Rogers will best be remembered as 
the pitcher who walked in the winning run against the Atlanta Braves in 
Game 6 of the 1999 NLCS, costing the New York Mets the game and the series. 
On June 29, 2005, after walking out onto Ameriquest Field for a pre-game 
warmup against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Rogers shoved two cameramen,[4] 
knocking a camera to the ground. One of the reporters then resumed filming 
and Rogers shoved him again, this time kicking the camera after it had 
been knocked to the ground a second time. He had to be restrained and was 
sent home. Larry Rodriguez of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex' Fox Network 
affiliate KDFW was taken to a local hospital, complaining of shoulder, 
arm and leg pain. While in the hospital, Rodriguez made an official complaint 
of assault against Rogers. On July 1, 2005, Commissioner Bud Selig suspended 
Rogers for 20 games and fined him $50,000. While an appeal of his suspension 
was pending, Rogers appeared at the 2005 All-Star Game in Detroit. The 
suspension was subsequently upheld by Selig. The commissioner was later 
overruled by independent arbitor Shyam Das, allowing Rogers to return to 
play after sitting out 13 games. On July 18, 2005, Rogers was charged with 
a Class A misdemeanor assault charge with regard to Rodriguez and a Class 
C misdemeanor assault charge with regard to FSN Southwest cameraman David 
Mammeli. Rogers was cited and released on $1,500 bond. The Class A charge 
was later reduced to Class C following Rogers' completion of an anger management 
course. On August 11, 2005, Rogers returned to the mound against the Boston 
Red Sox in Fenway Park. Rogers allowed five runs and seven hits in five 
innings, on the way to a 16–5 Boston victory. He finished 2005 with a 3.46 
ERA in 195 1⁄3 innings. Shortly after the regular season ended, the Rangers 
announced Rogers would not return to the team. On October 5, 2005, Rodriguez 
filed a civil suit against Rogers and the Rangers, seeking an unspecified 
amount of monetary damages. On December 8, 2005, Rogers signed a two-year, 
$16 million contract with the Detroit Tigers. Rogers ended the 2006 regular 
season with a record of 17–8 and a 3.84 ERA. "We've needed a guy like that 
for a long time. I'm glad we went out and got him. ... He means a lot to 
our team and to guys like me", said Tigers starter Jeremy Bonderman on 
Rogers. Rogers, on his first year in Detroit: "There's a lot of benefits 
here, by far, that you wouldn't know as a visiting player, and for me, 
I've been around quite a while, but I appreciate the town, the city, the 
people. The travel for a baseball player is very hard, but here it's not 
that difficult. It lends itself to being able to relax on certain days 
that you could get off. There's just more benefits, especially when you 
have the quality of people here like Dombrowski and like we have in Mr. 
Ilitch, those things that you can't take for granted. You add in Jim Leyland 
and the coaching staff here, and I just got lucky to choose this place... 
Right when I went in the door and met them, I knew. I knew where I was 
going to end up." [5] On March 30, 2007, ESPN reported that Rogers would 
miss three months after undergoing surgery for a blood clot in his pitching 
shoulder. He made his return on June 22 against the Atlanta Braves, pitching 
6 scoreless innings and allowing two hits while earning his first win of 
the season. On October 6, 2006, Rogers won his first postseason game, pitching 
7 2⁄3 scoreless innings with eight strikeouts in a 6–0 Tigers victory against 
the Yankees in Game 3 of the American League Division Series. At 41 years 
and 330 days old, he became the oldest starting pitcher to earn his first 
career postseason win. A week later on October 13, Rogers retired nine 
batters in a row, in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series 
against the Oakland Athletics, allowing only two hits and two walks in 
7 1⁄3 scoreless innings, while striking out six and pacing the Tigers to 
a 3–0 victory, leaving the Tigers one win away from their first World Series 
appearance since 1984. Rogers started Game 2 of the 2006 World Series on 
October 22, 2006. "We wanted Kenny to pitch two games at home", Leyland 
said.[6] He left the game with the Tigers in the lead 3–0, pitching 8 shutout 
innings, retiring 10 straight batters, striking out five, allowing only 
two hits, with three walks, making him the oldest starting pitcher to win 
a World Series game,[7] and one of only two pitchers over the age of 40 
to do so (Curt Schilling would become the second in 2007). During the first 
inning, Fox cameras caught a smudge on Rogers' pitching hand. Rogers said 
it was dirt mixed with rosin from the rosin bag and wiped it off. Major 
League Baseball spokesperson Rich Levin said the incident was investigated, 
and the substance was described as dirt. Since it was not ruled a foreign 
substance, per Rule 8.02, Rogers remained in the game.[8] In the process, 
Rogers extended his streak to 23 shutout innings. Examination of images 
from previous games revealed similar smudges in two other games.[9] After 
injuries shortened his 2007 and 2008 seasons, Rogers ceased playing at 
the end of 2008. With 219 career victories, he became the seventh 200-game 
winner who never won 20 games in any one season, joining Milt Pappas, Jerry 
Reuss, Frank Tanana, Charlie Hough, Dennis Martínez and Chuck Finley. Tim 
Wakefield joined the group with his 200th win in 2011. Mike Mussina reached 
200 wins without having a 20-win season, but recorded a 20-win season afterward. 
On August 6, 2011, Rogers was enshrined into the Texas Rangers Hall of 
Fame. In 2010, Rogers served as a pitching coach for the Detroit Tigers 
during spring training. According to remarks by Justin Verlander and Jim 
Leyland, his ability to coach pitchers on fielding would be particularly 
of interest to the team.[10] In 2011, Rogers threw out the ceremonial first 
pitch at Comerica Park in game three of the ALDS.[11] Rogers reportedly 
never formally retired from Major League Baseball.[10] Rogers pitched the 
fourteenth perfect game in baseball history on July 28, 1994 with the Rangers 
against the California Angels (the last no-hitter in Rangers history to 
date [12] and the only perfect game in franchise history). Soon after his 
feat, he appeared on ABC's Good Morning America on July 29, 1994, and on 
CBS's Late Show with David Letterman on August 1, 1994. He also met and 
appeared with musician Kenny Rogers at a function in Arlington, Texas on 
August 13, 1994. Rogers' 1994 perfect game was caught by Iván Rodríguez, 
who in June 2007 caught the no-hitter of Detroit Tiger Justin Verlander, 
both of whom were teammates of Rogers at the time. The game took place 
exactly three years to the day of the last perfect game, pitched by Dennis 
Martínez of the Montreal Expos on July 28, 1991. Known as one of the finest 
fielding pitchers in baseball, Rogers won five Gold Glove Awards at pitcher, 
including four with the Rangers and one with the Tigers. He was honored 
with a Fielding Bible Award in 2008 as the top fielding pitcher in MLB.[13] 
Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane stated that Rogers "was the 
best fielding pitcher" he ever saw. "It's like having an extra infielder".[14] 
On June 18, 2006 Rogers won his 200th game (against the Chicago Cubs at 
Wrigley Field), during which Detroit set a club record with eight home 
runs.[15] Rogers is second all-time in pickoffs with 93 in his career. 
On May 9, 2008 against the New York Yankees, Rogers picked off Wilson Betemit 
in the second inning for his 92nd pick-off, passing Mark Langston. Italics denotes post-season perfect game
