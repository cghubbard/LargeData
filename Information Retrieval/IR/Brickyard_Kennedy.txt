William Park (Brickyard) Kennedy (October 7, 1867 – September 23, 1915) 
was a starting pitcher in Major League Baseball. From 1892 through 1903, 
he played for the Brooklyn Grooms/Superbas (1892–1901), New York Giants 
(1902) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1903). Kennedy batted and threw right-handed. 
He was born in Bellaire, Ohio. In twelve seasons, Kennedy posted a 187–159 
record with 797 strikeouts and a 3.96 ERA in 3021 innings pitched. Kennedy 
was a dominant pitcher in his first four seasons with Brooklyn, winning 
25 games in 1893 and 24 in 1894. After averaging 17.5 victories in the 
next four seasons, he rebounded to win 22 in 1899 and 20 a year later. 
While pitching in 1901, he was bothered by arm problems and finished 3–5 
in eight starts. He signed with the New York Giants at the end of the season. 
In 1902, Kennedy made his first start with the Giants and pitched a shutout 
against his former team, 6–0, on four hits, his only win in a Giants uniform. 
Then, he was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates from the Giants. In 1903, 
Kennedy went 9–6 in 18 starts for the Pirates team that won the National 
League pennant. On his 35th birthday, Kennedy pitched in the first World 
Series. In Game Five, with Pittsburgh up three games to one, Kennedy faced 
Cy Young and the Boston Americans. Kennedy and Young each pitched five 
scoreless innings, until Honus Wagner committed two errors and Boston scored 
six runs. After giving up another four runs in the seventh, Kennedy was 
replaced and did not pitch again in the majors. Kennedy died from tuberculosis
