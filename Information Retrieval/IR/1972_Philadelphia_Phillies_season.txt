The 1972 Philadelphia Phillies season saw the team finish with a record 
of 59-97, last place in the National League East. The Phils made perhaps 
one of the most significant trades in their history on February 25, when 
they traded Rick Wise to the St. Louis Cardinals for Steve Carlton. Both 
teams were engaged in difficult contract negotiations with each pitcher. 
Carlton went on to win four Cy Young Awards with the Phillies, and Wise 
continued a solid career. Carlton won his first Cy Young Award on the 1972 
Phillies who won only 59 games. Carlton was 27-10 and the team was 32-87 
when Carlton did not pitch. No pitcher in the twentieth century has won 
as high a proportion of his team's victories (45.8%). Carlton also led 
the N.L. in ERA (1.97), strikeouts (310), and innings pitched (346). During 
the season, Steve Carlton became the last pitcher to win at least 25 games 
in one season for the Phillies in the 20th century.[4] On July 10, manager 
Frank Lucchesi was fired with the team at 26-50. Paul Owens, who had been 
promoted from farm director to GM a month earlier, became manager as well. 
The Padres came close to a no-hitter against the Phillies on July 18, 1972; 
Steve Arlin came within one out before a ninth-inning two-out single by 
Denny Doyle broke up the bid. The Phillies had hosted the 1952 All-Star 
Game, played July 9, 1952 at Shibe Park. The American League won 3 to 2 
in five innings; the first rain shortened All-Star Game. The Phillies held 
their promotional Old-Timers Game on August 19, 1972. The Phillies invited 
all of the players from the 1952 game back to Philadelphia to complete 
the last four innings. Mike Schmidt made his major league debut on September 
12.[5] Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB =
