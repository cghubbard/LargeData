Timothy Raines (born September 16, 1959), nicknamed "Rock",[1] is an American 
professional baseball coach and former player. He played as a left fielder 
in Major League Baseball for six teams from 1979 to 2002 and was best known 
for his 13 seasons with the Montreal Expos. He is regarded as one of the 
best leadoff hitters and baserunners in baseball history.[2][3][4] In 2013, 
Raines began working in the Toronto Blue Jays organization as a roving 
outfield and baserunning instructor.[5] Raines is the 1986 NL batting champion, 
a seven-time All-Star, and four-time stolen base champion. He has the most 
stolen bases of any player not inducted into the Hall of Fame. Raines was 
born in Sanford, Florida, to Ned and Florence Raines. He attended Seminole 
High School in Sanford.[6] As a baseball player at Seminole, Raines stole 
home plate ten times. He also rushed for 1,000 yards in eight football 
games and set two school track and field records that lasted for several 
years.[7] The Montreal Expos selected Raines in the fifth round of the 
1977 Major League Baseball draft.[8] After debuting with six games as a 
pinch runner in 1979, he played briefly as a second baseman for the Expos 
in 1980 but soon switched to playing the outfield, and rapidly became a 
fan favorite due to his aggressiveness on the basepaths. In his strike-interrupted 
1981 rookie season, he batted .304 and set a then Major League Baseball 
rookie record with 71 stolen bases,[note 1] breaking the previous mark 
of 56 steals set by Gene Richards in 1977.[10] Raines was caught stealing 
for the first time in 1981, after having begun his career with a major 
league record 27 consecutive successful stolen bases. Raines was the runner-up 
for the National League's Rookie of the Year Award in 1981, which was won 
by Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela. Raines's performance 
dipped in 1982,[11] as he hit .277 with a .353 on-base percentage.[12] 
At the end of the season, Raines entered treatment for substance abuse, 
having spent an estimated $40,000 that year on cocaine.[11] To avoid leaving 
the drug in his locker, Raines carried it in his hip pocket, and slid headfirst 
when running the bases.[13] He used cocaine before games, in his car, after 
games, and on some occasions, between innings in the clubhouse.[14] Raines 
would later testify at the infamous Pittsburgh drug trials, in September 
1985. In 1983, Raines resumed his exciting play, stealing a career high 
of 90 bases, the second-best total in franchise history, and scoring 133 
runs, a franchise record. He was named Expos Player of the Year in 1983, 
1985, and 1986. In each season from 1981 to 1986, Raines stole at least 
70 bases. He had a career-high .334 batting average in 1986, winning the 
National League Batting Championship. Raines maintained a consistently 
high on-base percentage during this period and a rising slugging percentage, 
reaching a career peak of .429 in 1987. Although he never won a Gold Glove 
Award, Raines was an excellent defensive player who led the National League 
with 21 assists in 1983 and, with 4 double plays, tied for the league lead 
in double plays by an outfielder in 1985. Raines became a free agent on 
November 12, 1986,[12] but in spite of his league-leading play, no team 
made a serious attempt to sign him.[15] (During this period, the Major 
League Baseball owners acted in collusion to keep salaries down.) On May 
1, 1987, hours after being permitted to negotiate again with Montreal, 
Raines signed a new deal with the Expos for $5,000,000 over three years, 
and a $900,000 signing bonus.[15] In his first game back on May 2, facing 
the Mets, although Raines had not participated in spring training or any 
other competitive preparation for the season, he hit the first pitch he 
saw off the right-field wall for a triple. Raines finished the game with 
four hits in five at-bats, three runs, one walk, a stolen base, and a game-winning 
grand slam in the 10th inning.[16][17] Even without having played in April, 
Raines led the Expos in runs, walks, times on base, runs created, and stolen 
bases, in addition to batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging 
percentage.[18] He also garnered MVP honors in the All-Star Game as he 
delivered a game-winning triple in the 13th inning. Raines would, in 1992, 
be one of dozens of players retroactively awarded collusion damages, receiving 
over $865,000.[19] Raines was traded to the Chicago White Sox on December 
20, 1990, along with Jeff Carter and a player to be named later (Mario 
Brito would eventually be agreed upon), in exchange for Iván Calderón and 
Barry Jones.[12] In his first season in the American League, Raines hit 
for a .268 average but had a .359 on-base percentage; he was second on 
the team in runs scored as the White Sox finished the season in second 
place in the American League Western Division. His average improved in 
1992 to .294 with a .380 on-base percentage. In 1993, despite missing nearly 
6 weeks in April & May due to a torn ligament in his thumb he suffered 
while stealing a base, he managed to hit .306 with 16 home runs as the 
White Sox won the American League Western Division title.[20] In the in 
1993 American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays, 
Raines posted a .444 batting average and scored five runs in a losing cause.[21] 
On December 28, 1995, he was traded to the New York Yankees. With the Yankees, 
Raines received two World Series rings in 1996 and 1998. While his playing 
time was curtailed due to injuries,[16] he contributed to a loose clubhouse 
atmosphere,[22][23] and was productive when he came up to the plate.[12] 
In January 1999, Raines signed as a free agent with the Oakland Athletics. 
After a kidney biopsy on July 23, Raines was diagnosed with lupus and spent 
the rest of the year undergoing treatment and recovery.[23][24] Raines 
was signed by the Yankees as a free agent on February 1, 2000,[25] but 
was released on March 23.[12] On December 21, Raines was signed by the 
Expos, returning to the team that drafted him.[12] At the Expos home opener 
in 2001, Raines received what he described as the longest and loudest standing 
ovation in his entire career, resulting in the pitcher walking him on four 
pitches.[26] With limited playing time, Raines batted .308, with a .433 
on-base percentage and a .436 slugging percentage. Raines underwent surgery 
on May 31 due to a left shoulder strain, and spent time rehabilitating 
with the Expos Triple-A club, the Ottawa Lynx. On August 21, 2001, Raines 
and his son, Tim Raines, Jr., became the first father-son pair to play 
against each other in an official professional baseball game, when the 
Lynx played the Rochester Red Wings (the two had faced each other earlier 
in the year during spring training).[27] Raines returned to the major league 
club on August 22. On October 3, the Expos traded Raines to the Baltimore 
Orioles, thereby permitting Raines to play a major league game with his 
son.[28][29] On October 4, Raines, Jr. played center field and Raines, 
Sr. played left field for Baltimore, becoming the second father and son 
team to play for the same major league team (a feat previously accomplished 
by Ken Griffey, Sr. and Ken Griffey, Jr.).[30] Raines played his last season 
in 2002 with the Florida Marlins. He is one of only 29 players in baseball 
history to date to have appeared in Major League baseball games in four 
decades, and was the last active player who was involved with the Pittsburgh 
drug trials. In a 23-year career, Raines played in 2,502 games accumulating 
2,605 hits in 8,872 at bats for a .294 career batting average along with 
170 home runs, 980 runs batted in, a .385 on-base percentage and a .425 
slugging percentage. He ended his career with a .988 fielding percentage. 
Raines stole at least 70 bases in each of his first six full seasons (1981–1986), 
leading the National League in stolen bases each season from 1981 to 1984, 
with a career high of 90 steals in 1983. Raines also led the National League 
in runs scored twice (1983 and 1987). Raines batted over .300 in five full 
seasons and over .320 from 1985 to 1987, winning the 1986 National League 
batting title with a .334 average. He also had six full seasons with an 
on-base percentage above .390. With 808 steals in his career, Raines has 
the fourth-highest total in major league history, behind Rickey Henderson, 
Lou Brock and Ty Cobb.[note 2] Until 2008,[note 3] His career stolen base 
percentage (84.7%) was the highest in major league history for players 
with 300 or more attempts[note 4] and he was successful on 40 consecutive 
steal attempts between July 1993 and August 1995, setting an American League 
record at the time (the record was broken by Ichiro Suzuki in May 2007, 
when he completed 45 consecutive steals). Among switch hitters, Raines 
ranks sixth in career hits (2,605), fourth in runs (1,571), walks (1,330) 
and times on base (3,977), fifth in plate appearances (10,359), seventh 
in singles (1,892), doubles (430), total bases (3,771) and at bats (8,872), 
eighth in triples (113) and tenth in extra base hits (713). He holds Expos/Washington 
Nationals franchise records for career runs (947), steals (635), singles 
(1,163), triples (82) and walks (793), and was the seventh player whose 
career began after 1945 to retire with over 1,500 runs and 100 triples.[note 
5] His 1,966 games in left field ranked seventh in major league history 
when he retired. From 1983 to 1987, Total Baseball rated him as one of 
the National League's five best players each season.[citation needed] He 
is also listed as the 40th greatest non-pitcher in major-league history 
according to Bill James's win shares formula, one place ahead of Mark McGwire.[citation

Raines was a National League All-Star in 7 consecutive seasons (1981–1987), 
and was named the Most Valuable Player of the 1987 All-Star Game.[33] In 
1981 the Sporting News named Raines the National League Rookie of the Year.[34] 
Raines finished in the top 10 in voting for the NL Most Valuable Player 
Award three times (1983, 1986, 1987). He won a Silver Slugger Award as 
an outfielder in 1986 when he led the National League in both batting average 
and on-base percentage. In 2013, Raines was elected into the Canadian Baseball 
Hall of Fame.[26] Raines was eligible for election to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame in January 2008, and various sabermetricians and commentators have 
supported his induction.[35][36][37][38][39] Raines began his coaching 
career in 2003 as manager of the Class A-Advanced Brevard County Manatees 
affiliate of the Expos. He was promoted to the major league team in 2004 
and was present for the Expos' final games as a Montreal franchise. He 
was a coach for the White Sox from November 2004 until October 2006.[40] 
During the 2005 World Series Championship season, Raines served as first 
base coach. During the 2006 season, he served as bench coach. He was the 
hitting coach for the minor-league Harrisburg Senators in 2007,[41] but 
was not retained by the team for 2008. Raines signed a two-year contract 
to manage the Newark Bears of the Atlantic League, starting in 2009. After 
the 2010 season, the Bears moved to the Canadian American Association of 
Professional Baseball, and the team announced Raines would return to manage 
in 2011.[42] In 2012, he was an assistant coach and Director of Player 
Development for the Bears.[41][43] The Toronto Blue Jays hired Raines as 
a minor league baserunning and outfield coach in 2013.[41][44][45] In 1979, 
Raines married Virginia Hilton, a classmate at Seminole High School. The 
couple gave birth to two children: Tim, Jr. ("Little Rock"), and André 
("Little Hawk").[46] In high school he was a running back and has said 
he enjoyed football more than baseball at the time.[citation needed] On 
the matter between the two he reflects, "...in football I was a running 
back, so in the NFL my career would have probably lasted six or seven years 
and in baseball I ended up playing 23 years. In baseball you can play a 
long time so I think it's better when you think of it in that way."[47] 
In 1985, Raines became a resident of Heathrow, Florida.[citation needed] 
In 2007, he moved to Estrella Mountain Ranch, a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona, 
and married Shannon Watson from Arnprior, Ontario.[48] Raines had twin
