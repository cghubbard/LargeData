Edmund Cogswell Converse (November 7, 1849 – April 4, 1921) was an American 
businessman, banker and baseball executive. He was a steel industry executive 
and participated in mergers that unified much of the American steel industry. 
Later, continuing an association with J. P. Morgan, he was the first president 
of Bankers Trust. Late in his life, the U.S. Steel founder consolidated 
20 farms to create the 1,481-acre (599 ha) tract known as Conyers Farm 
in Greenwich, Connecticut. Conyers Farm remained unoccupied for 15 years 
after Converse's death. Converse was born in Boston. After graduating from 
Boston Latin School in 1869, he secured an apprenticeship in McKeesport, 
Pennsylvania, with National Tube Works. He held several patents on improvements 
to tubing, such as lock-joints. After his innovations brought in several 
million dollars in sales, he became general manager of the company in 1889.[1] 
Converse purchased a lot on 78th Street in New York City from railroad 
executive Henry H. Cook in the late 1890s. He had C. P. H. Gilbert build 
his house at 3 East 78th Street.[2] Converse moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, 
several years later, buying 20 farms and consolidating them into the 1,489-acre 
(603 ha) Conyers Farm, which he named after the Old English spelling of 
his family name.[3][4] In addition to cows, pigs and poultry, the farm 
had apple, pear and peach orchards; butter, eggs and milk were produced 
there.[5] Conyers Farm was unoccupied from Converse's 1921 death to 1936.[6] 
Since the farm began accommodating luxury homes in the 1980s, several celebrities 
have lived there, including Tom Cruise, Ron Howard and Jessica Biel.[7] 
In 1899, he and William Nelson Cromwell facilitated the J. P. Morgan-funded 
merger of National Tube Works with 20 other companies, resulting in an 
enterprise known as the National Tube Company. Within two years, another 
Morgan-financed merger resulted in U.S. Steel. Converse became the president 
of two banks in 1903, Liberty National Bank and Bankers Trust. He led Liberty 
National Bank until 1907 and Bankers Trust until 1913. He was the president 
of Astor Trust from 1907 to 1917, when it was merged with Bankers Trust.[1] 
He served on the board of directors of U.S. Steel until 1916.[4] After 
the Pittsburgh Alleghenys baseball team in the American Association experienced 
a very poor season in 1883, they hired Converse as team president. The 
team got worse in 1884, but after that season Converse and manager Horace 
Phillips found out that the Columbus Buckeyes were disbanding. The pair 
went to Columbus and signed almost all of the players from the 1884 Buckeyes. 
The Alleghenys finished in third place in 1885; they were runners-up in 
1886.[8] When Pittsburgh moved from the American Association to the National 
League in 1887, William A. Nimick took over as president.[9] Converse engaged 
in philanthropic activities. In 1912, Converse financed the first endowed 
chair at the Harvard Business School.[10] Four years later, he donated 
$250,000 to establish a library at Amherst College, the alma mater of his 
brother James.[11] The Converse Library was dedicated in November 1917.[12] 
In 1879, Converse was married to Jessie MacDonough Green.[1] She died in 
1912, several months after undergoing an operation for appendicitis.[13] 
Two years later, the 64-year-old Converse married Mary Edith Dunshee, who 
was 48. Dunshee was the sister of Converse's brother's widow.[14] Converse's 
son, Edmund, Jr., owned the Rancho Santa Paula y Saticoy in Ventura County, 
California.[15] A daughter, Antoinette, moved to Germany after marrying 
Baron von Romberg, who died in World War I.[16] Another daughter, Katherine, 
married one of her father's protégés, Benjamin Strong, Jr.; Strong was 
a president of Bankers Trust and governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York.[17] Converse died at the Huntington Hotel of heart problems in 
1921.[18] Local press coverage after his death included the unsubstantiated 
assertion that Converse may have been murdered.[3] Upon his death, his 
estate was valued at US$21,000,000 ($279,072,761 today), most of which 
was willed to colleges, charities and family members. Among the willed 
items was a portrait of Benjamin Thompson, which was thought to be worth
