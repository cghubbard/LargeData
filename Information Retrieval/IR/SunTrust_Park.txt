SunTrust Park is a baseball park under construction in the southeastern 
United States, located in the Cumberland area of Cobb County, Georgia, 
northwest of Atlanta. It is scheduled to become the home of the Atlanta 
Braves of Major League Baseball (MLB) in 2017. Instead of renovating Turner 
Field, the Braves announced on November 11, 2013, that they would leave 
when their lease ends, after the 2016 season.[12] The Braves' first game 
at SunTrust Park in 2017 will be a preseason game against the New York 
Yankees on March 31, as a soft opening for season ticket holders,[13] while 
the first regular season game is scheduled for April 14 against the San 
Diego Padres.[14] Turner Field has been the home of the Braves since the 
1997 season. It was originally built as Centennial Olympic Stadium for 
the 1996 Summer Olympics, then partially reconstructed as a baseball-only 
stadium, eliminating the possibility of other sporting event uses, such 
as track and field. The stadium is owned by the Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation 
Authority (AFCRA) and leased to the Braves, who have full control over 
its operations. Turner Field is a relatively new facility, younger than 
13 of the other 29 major league stadiums, but there were numerous issues 
that led the Braves to seek a new ballpark.[15] According to vice chairman 
John Schuerholz, Turner Field needs $350 million in renovations—$150 million 
for structural upkeep and $200 million to improve the fan experience.[16] 
Braves executive vice president Mike Plant has stated that capital maintenance 
would be much less at the new stadium.[17] While Turner Field was designed 
from the ground up with the Braves in mind, Plant said that it requires 
higher capital maintenance costs because it was value engineered for the 
1996 Summer Olympics.[17] This has led to higher capital maintenance costs 
in the long run.[17] Plant estimates that capital maintenance costs at 
the new stadium will be no more than $80 million after 30 years – less 
than the $150 million in capital maintenance needed for Turner Field after 
17 years.[17] Braves executives say that fans have been unwilling to come 
to games in recent years due to metro Atlanta's infamous traffic congestion.[16] 
Also the Braves claim that parking around the stadium is inadequate.[16] 
Turner Field is under-served by about 5,000 parking spaces.[16] In addition, 
Plant has noted the downtown location "doesn't match up with where the 
majority of our fans come from."[18] Plant said that while the Braves operate 
Turner Field, they have no control over the commercial development around 
the stadium.[19] Other baseball stadiums built in recent years have been 
accompanied by nearby shopping and entertainment.[19] The Braves were in 
talks in 2013 with the recreational authority to extend the team's original 
lease, Plant said, but those talks broke down.[19] Atlanta mayor Kasim 
Reed said the city could not afford to support the kind of renovations 
the Braves desired, especially while already funding Mercedes-Benz Stadium 
for the National Football League's Atlanta Falcons.[19] The stadium will 
be in Cumberland (also known as Cumberland/Galleria area), a fast-growing 
edge city in southeastern Cobb County.[1] The ballpark will be located 
next to the highway interchange between Interstate 75 and Interstate 285.[20] 
The stadium will have an Atlanta address due to its location in ZIP code 
30339, which is shared with the neighboring community of Vinings. The United 
States Postal Service considers this area to be unincorporated Atlanta. 
The Braves say the location is "near the geographic center of the Braves' 
fan base."[21] The team announced at the stadium's groundbreaking that 
the naming rights were sold to SunTrust Banks for a 25-year partnership.[22] 
Braves officials anticipate a capacity of about 41,500,[3][16] which is 
approximately 8,000 fewer than Turner Field.[23] In 2013, the Braves announced 
there would be about 6,000 parking spaces which is 2,500 fewer than at 
Turner Field.[24] However, in August 2016, the Braves announced that SunTrust 
Park would have 9,000 spots and add more spaces before Opening Day 2017.[25] 
Also, in order to reduce traffic congestion, the Braves announced that 
games played Monday through Thursday would start at 7:30 pm.[25] Games 
at Turner Field started at 7 pm on those days.[25] The Braves plan to utilize 
thousands of additional parking spaces surrounding the stadium, including 
the Cobb Galleria area. These parking spaces will be connected to the stadium 
via a circulator shuttle. There are approximately 30,000 parking spaces 
within 2 miles of the proposed stadium site.[26] The Braves are expect 
to announce phase two of their parking plan in the fourth quarter of 2016 
and phase three in the first quarter of 2017.[25] The new stadium will 
be constructed in a public/private partnership with a project budget of 
$622 million.[6][27] Cobb County will contribute $392 million.[6] The county 
is raising $368 million through bonds, $14 million from transportation 
taxes, and $10 million cash from businesses in the Cumberland Community 
Improvement District.[6] The Braves will contribute the remaining $230 
million, which can be increased up to $280 million at the team's discretion.[6] 
In March 2015, a security filing from Braves owners Liberty Media allotted 
$672 million for SunTrust Park and $452 million for the surrounding mixed-use 
development.[28] It adds up to a total cost of above $1.1 billion.[28] 
The baseball stadium will occupy 15 acres (6.1 ha) of a 60-acre (24 ha) 
lot, with the remainder of the space devoted to parking, green space, and 
mixed-use development.[16] Although the new stadium will be over 10 miles 
(16 km) from the nearest train station, the Braves plan to use a "circulator" 
bus system to shuttle fans to and from the stadium.[19] On July 8, 2015, 
the Braves announced an agreement for Atlanta-based Gas South to remain 
the official natural gas partner when the team moves to SunTrust Park. 
Under the agreement, Gas South will receive prominent signage in the new 
ballpark, including a 75-foot long "Bring the Heat" LED board in left field 
that will display pitching statistics and fan-friendly messaging throughout 
the game.[29] On November 20, 2013, the Braves unveiled plans to build 
a $400 million entertainment district that will surround the ballpark.[26] 
The district will feature a street lined with retail, restaurants and bars 
leading up to the stadium.[26] The $400 million is entirely funded by the 
Braves and their development partners.[26] On October 14, 2015 the Atlanta 
Braves announced that the complex would be called The Battery Atlanta.[30] 
On March 17, 2015, the Braves announced a partnership with Comcast under 
which Comcast will provide high-tech infrastructure for SunTrust Park and 
will become an anchor tenant at The Battery Atlanta.[31] Comcast will occupy 
100% of a nine-story office building in the mixed-use development adjacent 
to the stadium.[31] The office tower, which will overlook the ballpark, 
will become Comcast's Southeast regional headquarters.[31] According to 
Braves chairman and CEO Terry McGuirk, Comcast will "lend its expertise 
to drive the most technologically advanced ballpark and mixed-use development 
ever built."[31] Some 1,000 Comcast employees will work at the office building, 
most of them new hires.[31] The office also will include an "innovation 
lab" for new technologies.[31] On April 28, 2015, the Braves announced 
a 50-50 partnership with Omni Hotels & Resorts on a luxury hotel to be 
built overlooking SunTrust Park.[32] The full service hotel will be 16 
floors and have 260 rooms.[32] It also will feature a two-story restaurant, 
rooftop hospitality suites, and an elevated pool deck with views into the 
ballpark.[32] The Atlanta Braves be will the 50/50 owners with Omni Hotels 
& Resorts.[32] On July 16, 2015, the Braves and concert promoter Live Nation 
announced a deal to develop and manage the long-planned entertainment venue 
adjacent to SunTrust Park.[33] The venue will be called the Roxy Theatre 
in homage to the old Roxy Theatre that was torn down in 1972.[33] The venue 
will have standing room-only capacity for 4,000 and feature about 40 music 
and comic shows annually.[33] The theater is designed to help drive activity 
to the site on non-gamedays and it will also play host to special events.[33] 
The first restaurants announced for The Battery Atlanta were: Antico Pizza, 
Cru Food and Wine Bar, Tomahawk Taproom featuring Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q, chef 
Ford Fry’s Superica restaurant and a new steak concept by chef Linton Hopkins.[30] 
On May 19, 2016, the Braves announced several new signed tenants at The 
Battery Atlanta including Wahlburgers, Harley-Davidson, and Goldbergs Bagel 
Co. & Deli.[34] The opening of the restaurant outside the Braves’ new Cobb 
County ballpark is expected to be featured prominently in “Wahlburgers,” 
the brothers’ A&E reality television show about the business.[34] Another 
big operator, national restaurant, retail, casino and entertainment venue 
developer Cordish Cos., plans a trio of concepts including a Professional 
Bull Riders Association Bar & Grill, featuring a mechanical bull.[34] On 
January 28, 2014, the Braves announced that Populous would be designing 
the new ballpark.[7] Populous has designed 19 of the 30 Major League stadiums 
currently in use including Marlins Park, Target Field, and Yankee Stadium.[7] 
The Braves chose Populous over HKS, Inc. who served as a consultant for 
the Braves prior to the selection of Populous.[7] On May 14, 2014, the 
Braves released the first renderings of the new stadium.[35] The ballpark 
will be oriented to the southwest.[35] Only a handful of other Major League 
ballparks have a southwest orientation; however, Braves officials said 
that a comprehensive sun study was conducted by the team and designers 
and the orientation will not be an issue.[35] The seven images released 
by the Braves showcased the new ballpark as well as unique shops, restaurants 
and entertainment venues.[35] Also, the plan is for the complex to offer 
approximately 500 residences, a boutique hotel, and office space.[36][37] 
The ballpark will feature an intimate configuration placing the highest 
percentage of seats closer to the field than any other ball park in Major 
League Baseball.[36] Braves executive vice president of sales and marketing 
Derek Schiller has stated that the plans for the seating bowl are aimed 
at putting fans closer to the action.[38] Not by reducing the amount of 
foul territory, but with cantilever designs that push the middle and upper 
bowls toward the field.[38] The ballpark will also include a 90-feet-wide 
canopy horseshoeing around the stadium's top[38] and air conditioning on 
every level to ensure that fans remain cool on hot summer days.[36] The 
existing topography of the property has been integrated into the design.[36] 
The Braves plan to use LED lights for the stadium.[39] LED lights provide 
better quality for fans in the stands and watching on TV.[39] LED lights 
will also reduce the time it takes to restore lighting in case of a power 
outage.[39] On December 10, 2014, the Braves released new renderings of 
the planned entertainment complex surrounding SunTrust Park.[40] The new 
renderings further define the public spaces and show a blend of architectural 
styles, with a blend of steel, brick and glass facades.[40] Derek Schiller, 
the Braves executive vice president of sales and marketing, said in a conference 
call with reporters that the rendering represent the concept of project's 
look, and is not the final design.[40] But the locations of buildings and 
streets demonstrated in the designs are largely settled.[40] Two taller 
glass towers, a hotel and an office building, will feature views into the 
ballpark.[40] The complex also will feature a brewpub and Braves store.[40] 
The Braves named architectural design firm Wakefield Beasley & Associates 
as the lead designer of the mixed-used project surrounding the stadium.[41][42] 
On April 16, 2014, Atlanta Braves and Cobb County officials outlined the 
timetable for the new stadium's construction.[11] Site clearing was scheduled 
to begin July 15, 2014 and complete by October 13, 2014.[11] However, site 
clearing started ahead of schedule after the Cobb County commission vote 
on May 27, 2014.[43] The Atlanta Braves held a formal groundbreaking ceremony 
on September 16.[5][44] The ceremony took place at the site near the northwest 
intersection of Interstates 75 and 285.[44] In order to start construction 
three natural gas lines that ran under the property had to be moved.[45] 
The high cost of moving the gas lines is one of the key reasons the land 
had not been developed.[45] The cost to move the lines was $14 million.[46] 
The pipelines were moved to the perimeter.[45] Two of the lines, which 
run about eight feet underground, are owned by Colonial Pipeline Company, 
and the third belongs to Atlanta Gas Light Company.[45] The project was 
completed in early November, 2014.[46] In November 2014, workers started 
drilling the holes for the pylons around the outside perimeter of the stadium's 
footprint.[47] According to the Braves vice president of business operations 
Mike Plant, phase one of construction for both the stadium and mixed-use 
development began in November 2014 and included infrastructure for the 
site, such as sewer, water and electrical systems.[46] The retention walls 
for the underground service level of the stadium were also built.[47] The 
underground level will have a few hundred parking spaces for players, team 
doctors, clubhouse staff and management staff.[47] By May 2015, crews had 
installed all the caissons to stabilize the foundation.[39] With the caissons 
complete the crews are beginning to pour concrete for the decks.[39] On 
August 27, 2015, the Atlanta Braves held a ceremony for the first brick 
laid of 775,000 bricks that will be the main exterior at SunTrust Park.[48] 
On hand for the ceremony were dignitaries from the Braves, Cobb County 
government, and ballpark sponsors.[48] The first brick was laid by Eutis 
Morris, 83, who laid the first concrete block at Fulton County Stadium 
and placed the first and last bricks at Olympic Stadium, which later became 
Turner Field.[48] Also laying bricks were former Atlanta Braves player 
Hank Aaron and the team's current first baseman Freddie Freeman.[48] The 
team also sealed two time capsules.[48] The capsules included a video of 
the SunTrust Park ground breaking; parts of the Big Chicken; a 1948 World 
Series program; dirt from both older stadiums; a baseball signed by the 
1995 championship team; and recordings from team broadcasters.[48] These 
time capsules will be opened when the stadium is demolished. In June 2016, 
construction started on a pedestrian bridge to connect SunTrust Park with 
the Cobb Galleria.[49] The bridge will span Interstate 285.[49] To fund 
construction, Cobb county plans to use $5 million given by the Cumberland 
Community Improvement District, about $4.5 million in federal grants, $380,000 
from the Atlanta Braves and about $159,000 from a special taxing district 
in Cumberland created to help fund the new Braves stadium’s construction.[50] 
The bridge is expected to be open in time for SunTrust Park's opening.[50] 
In July 2016, the installation of the seats for SunTrust Park started.[51] 
Also, the installation of hundreds of LED lights were installed along the 
edge of the ballpark’s canopy from the right-field foul pole to home plate.[51] 
Additionally, a large, light-up tomahawk was installed.[51] While the new 
tomahawk will be similar to its counterpart at Turner Field, it will be 
upgraded.[51] Meanwhile, the 108,000-square-foot metal canopy that will 
cover about 60 percent of these seats is nearly complete.[51] In August 
2016, the canopy, lights and seating bowl were nearing completion and the 
last crane remaining on the field area was removed.[51] After the new stadium 
was announced, citizens organized campaigns both supporting and opposing 
the plan, which was made public only two weeks before the Cobb County Commission 
voted. More than 80% of county residents supported delaying the vote,[52] 
Cobb Chairman Tim Lee and Commissioner Helen Goreham insisted that vote 
could not be delayed because it would threaten the stadium's timeline.[53] 
An InsiderAdvantage/FOX 5 poll released on November 25, 2013, showed that 
59% of registered voters in Cobb County favored building a new stadium 
for the Braves.[54] However, support fell to 30% of Cobb County voters 
when they were asked if they'd support funding the stadium with Cobb County 
tax dollars, with 56% opposed and 14% undecided.[54] On September 8, 2014, 
the University of Florida's Department of Tourism, Recreation and Sports 
Management released the first independent scientific poll on Cobb residents' 
attitude toward the public investment in the stadium.[55] The survey found 
that 55% of the survey respondents would have supported the stadium in 
a referendum.[55] Two weeks after the Atlanta Braves announced the new 
stadium project, the Cobb County Commission held a public hearing to vote 
on whether to approve the plan.[56] Citizens who both supported and opposed 
the plan began crowding into the meeting hall hours before the 7 p.m. hearing 
was to begin, many sporting "Cobb: Home of the Braves" T-shirts.[56] After 
a one-hour public comment on the new stadium project the Cobb County Commission 
voted 4–1 to approve a memorandum of understanding with the Atlanta Braves.[56] 
On May 27, 2014, the Cobb County Commissioners voted unanimously, 5–0, 
on the operating agreement that bound the county to borrow up to $397 million 
to build the new stadium.[6] Cobb-Marietta Coliseum & Exhibit Hall Authority 
plans to issue up to $397 million in bonds for the project.[57] Retired 
businessman Larry Savage, attorney Tucker Hobgood, and Austell resident 
Rich Pellegrino have filed notices of appeal with the Georgia Supreme Court, 
to argue against issuance of the bonds.[57] Attorneys Lesly Gaynor Murray 
and Blake Sharpton of law firm Butler Snow, the county's bond counsel, 
represented Cobb in the Supreme Court.[57] The appeal was heard by the 
Georgia Supreme Court in February, 2015.[57] On June 29, 2015, the Georgia 
Supreme Court unanimously upheld the bond authorization.[58] The failed 
appeal represented the last legal challenge to the SunTrust Park project.[58] 
In July 2016, Cobb County commissioner Tim Lee lost his bid for election 
to challenger Mike Boyce.[59] Boyce had called the election a delayed referendum 
on the stadium deal, but Lee pointed to four other commissioners who were
