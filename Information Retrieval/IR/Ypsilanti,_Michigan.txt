Ypsilanti (/ˌɪpsᵻˈlænti/, US dict: ĭp′·sĭ·lăn′·tē; often mispronounced 
/ˌjɪpsᵻˈlænti/, US dict: yĭp′·sĭ·lăn′·tē), commonly shortened to Ypsi, 
is a city in Washtenaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan, perhaps best 
known as the home of Eastern Michigan University. As of the 2010 census, 
the city's population was 19,435. The city is bounded to the north by Superior 
Township and on the west, south, and east by Ypsilanti Township. Ypsilanti 
is located 6 miles (10 km) east of Ann Arbor and about 18 miles (29 km) 
west of the Detroit city limits. The geographic grid center of Ypsilanti 
is the intersection of the Huron River and Michigan Avenue, the latter 
of which connects downtown Detroit, Michigan with Chicago, Illinois, and 
through Ypsilanti is partially concurrent with U.S. Route 12 Business and 
M-17. Originally a trading post established in 1809 by Gabriel Godfroy, 
a French-Canadian fur trader from Montreal, a permanent settlement was 
established on the east side of the Huron River in 1823 by Major Thomas 
Woodruff. It was incorporated into the Territory of Michigan as the village 
Woodruff's Grove. A separate community a short distance away on the west 
side of the river was established in 1825 under the name "Ypsilanti", after 
Demetrios Ypsilantis, a hero in the Greek War of Independence.[6] Woodruff's 
Grove changed its name to Ypsilanti in 1829, the year its namesake effectively 
won the Greek war, and the two communities eventually merged. A bust of 
Demetrios Ypsilantis by Greek sculptor Christopher Nastos[7] stands between 
a Greek and a US flag at the base of the landmark Ypsilanti Water Tower. 
Ypsilanti has played an important role in the automobile industry. From 
1920 to 1922, Apex Motors produced the "ACE" car. It was in Ypsilanti that 
Preston Tucker (whose family owned the Ypsilanti Machine Tool Company) 
designed and built the prototypes for his Tucker '48. Tucker's story was 
related in the film Tucker: The Man and His Dream, directed by Francis 
Ford Coppola. In 1945, Henry J. Kaiser and Joseph W. Frazer bought the 
nearby Willow Run B-24 Liberator bomber plant from Ford Motor Company, 
and started to make Kaiser and Frazer model cars in 1947. The last Kaiser 
car made in Ypsilanti rolled off the assembly line in 1953, when the company 
merged with Willys-Overland and moved production to Toledo, Ohio. General 
Motors purchased the Kaiser Frazer plant, and converted it into its Hydramatic 
Division (now called its Powertrain division), beginning production in 
November 1953. The GM Powertrain Division ceased production at this facility 
in 2010. Ypsilanti is also the location of the last Hudson automobile dealership. 
Today, the former dealership is the site of the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage 
Collection. The museum is the home to an original Fabulous Hudson Hornet 
race car, which inspired the character Doc Hudson in the 2006 Pixar animated 
film Cars. In the early 1970s, along with neighboring city of Ann Arbor, 
the citizens reduced the penalty for the use and sale of marijuana to $5[8] 
(the Ypsilanti Marijuana Initiative; see also the Human Rights Party). 
When Ypsilanti prosecuted a man possessing 100 pounds (45 kg) of cannabis 
under state law, the defense argued he should have been charged under Ypsilanti's 
ordinance. The trial judge declared the ordinance's requirement that Ypsilanti 
prosecute only under city law unenforceable. An appeal court upheld the 
trial judge's ruling. Later, Ypsilanti City Council, using its power of 
codification, deleted the ordinance.[citation needed] In 1979, Faz Husain 
was elected to the Ypsilanti city council, the first Muslim and the first 
native of India to win elected office in Michigan. In the 1990s Ypsilanti 
became the first city in Michigan to pass a living wage ordinance. In the 
late 1990s, the city adopted an ordinance to ban discrimination in housing, 
employment and public accommodation on the basis of sexual orientation, 
gender identity/transgender status, body weight (i.e., being obese or underweight). 
Two ballot measures to repeal the ordinance were led and bankrolled by 
conservatives, including Tom Monaghan. Both measures failed, the second 
by a larger percentage than the first.[citation needed] On July 23, 2007, 
Governor Jennifer Granholm announced that Ypsilanti, along with the cities 
of Caro and Clio, was chosen by the Michigan State Housing Development 
Authority (MSHDA) to take part in the Blueprints for Michigan's Downtowns 
program. The award provides for an economic development consultant to assist 
Ypsilanti in developing a growth and job creation strategy for the downtown 
area.[9] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total 
area of 4.52 square miles (11.71 km2), of which 4.33 square miles (11.21 km2) 
is land and 0.19 square miles (0.49 km2) is water.[1] The Huron River flows 
through both the City of Ypsilanti and the Charter Township of Ypsilanti. 
Ypsilanti is located at 42°14′N 83°37′W﻿ / ﻿42.24°N 83.62°W﻿ / 42.24; -83.62, 
in the western reaches of the Detroit/Windsor metropolitan area. Suburban 
development between Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor, via Washtenaw Avenue and Packard 
Road, has been unbroken since the late 1960s. Downtown Ypsilanti and the 
surrounding neighborhoods are the site of many historical homes, including 
kit homes by companies like Aladdin and Sears. As of the census[2] of 2010,

15.3% of those age 65 or over. Ypsilanti is often shortened to "Ypsi," 
particularly in spoken conversation and local/regional usage. Because a 
large number of residents or their ancestors migrated from Appalachia, 
certain neighborhoods (particularly on the far east side of the city and 
into Ypsilanti Township) are sometimes called "Ypsitucky." Harriette Arnow's 
book The Dollmaker, which was made into a film starring Jane Fonda, focused 
on the lives of these "Ypsituckians." Recently, the use of the term "Ypsitucky" 
has come under increased scrutiny due to its historically derogatory connotation. 
In 2008, the issue was raised after a dinner being held in Ann Arbor to 
honor Harriette Arnow was described as an "Ypsitucky Supper" in some of 
the event organizer's media releases.[15][16] In 2009, planning began for 
the "Ypsitucky Jamboree," a new music festival celebrating bluegrass music 
to be held in Ypsilanti in September 2009; this resulted in objections 
from some area residents and some members of the City Council, leading 
to renaming the event as simply "The Jamboree."[17][18][19] Ypsilanti Community 
Schools serve residents of the city, as well as parts of Ypsilanti Township 
and Superior Township. Ypsilanti Public Schools and Willow Run Community 
Schools merged to form a new, united district on July 1, 2013. Charter 
schools in the city include Arbor Preparatory High School. It also was 
the setting of a well known and long running High/Scope Perry Preschool 
Study regarding the effects of early childhood education in children. The 
study researched the effects of preschool on the later lives of low income 
children from the area.[20] Global Educational Excellence operates the 
Global Tech Academy (PreK-5) in nearby Ypsilanti Township.[21][22] A college 
town, Ypsilanti is home to Eastern Michigan University, founded in 1849 
as Michigan State Normal School. Today, Eastern Michigan University has 
18,000+ undergraduate and more than 4,800 graduate students.[23] As well, 
Ypsilanti is home to Washtenaw Community College (WCC) sponsored off-site 
extension center. Ypsilanti was also the home to the main editing site 
of the Linguist List, a major online resource for the field of linguistics. 
It was mostly staffed by graduate students who attend Eastern Michigan 
University and runs several database websites and mailing lists.[24] Ypsilanti 
has the second largest contiguous historic district in the state of Michigan,[25] 
behind only the much larger city of Grand Rapids. The historic district 
includes both downtown Ypsilanti, along Michigan Avenue, and the Depot 
Town area adjacent to Frog Island Park and Riverside Park, which features 
many specialty shops, bars and grills, and a farmers' market. The Tridge 
is a three-way wooden footbridge under the Cross Street bridge over the 
Huron River at 42°14′44″N 83°36′42″W﻿ / ﻿42.24561°N 83.61160°W﻿ / 42.24561; 
-83.61160. The Tridge connects Riverside Park, Frog Island Park, and Depot 
Town.[26][27] The Ypsilanti Water Tower, adjacent to the campus of Eastern 
Michigan University, holds the unique distinction of being the winner of 
the Most Phallic Building contest. Other sites of interest include: Ypsilanti 
is served by daily newspapers from Detroit. Ypsilanti once had its own 
daily newspaper, the Ypsilanti Press, but that paper closed June 28, 1994, 
after 90 years in business.[28] Upon closing, the Press sold its masthead, 
archives and subscriber list to the Ann Arbor News, which then began publishing 
an Ypsilanti edition. The Ann Arbor News ceased publication on July 23, 
2009; it was replaced by a new Internet-based news operation, AnnArbor.com, 
which also produces print editions on Thursdays and Sundays. A weekly newspaper, 
the Ypsilanti Courier, is published every Thursday by Heritage Media from 
their Saline, MI offices. Local radio stations include: Domino's Pizza 
was founded in Ypsilanti in 1960 near the campus of Eastern Michigan University. 
By 1963, Clara Owens established the Ypsilanti Greek Theater in Ypsilanti, 
Michigan for the performance of Greek theater productions. In 1966 the 
Ypsilanti Greek Theater opened at the EMU Baseball field. Bert Lahr and 
Dame Judith Anderson starred in two productions, The Oresteia, a trilogy 
of Greek tragedies written by Aeschylus and The Birds by playwright Aristophanes. 
Since 1979, the city has become known for summer festivals in the part 
of the city called "Depot Town", which is adjacent to both Riverside and 
Frog Island Parks along the banks of the Huron River. Festivals include 
the annual Ypsilanti Heritage Festival, the Elvis Festival, the Orphan 
Car Festival, the Michigan Brewers Guild Summer Beer Festival, the former 
Frog Island Festival, and a Latino festival. Painter Fay Kleinman moved 
to Ypsilanti in the late 1980s with her husband, pianist Emanuel Levenson. 
Overlooking Riverside Park is the non-profit Riverside Arts Center. Established 
in 1994 through the efforts of the Ypsilanti Downtown Development Authority 
and several public spirited citizens, the Riverside boasts a 115-seat black 
box theater, a sizable art gallery and some meeting rooms and offices. 
In 2006 the adjacent DTE building was renovated with "Cool Cities Initiative" 
money and is in the process of being incorporated into the center's activities. 
Depot Town in Ypsilanti is also home to the Michigan ElvisFest every summer.
