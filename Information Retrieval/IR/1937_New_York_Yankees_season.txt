The 1937 New York Yankees season was their 35th season. The team finished 
with a record of 102â€“52, winning their 9th pennant, finishing 13 games 
ahead of the Detroit Tigers. New York was managed by Joe McCarthy. The 
Yankees played at Yankee Stadium. In the World Series, they beat the New 
York Giants in 5 games. This gave the Yankees a 3-to-2 edge in overall 
series play against the Giants. 1937 saw significant changes in the layout 
of Yankee Stadium, as concrete bleachers were built to replace the aging 
wooden structure, reducing the cavernous "death valley" of left center 
and center considerably, although the area remained a daunting target for 
right-handed power hitters such as Joe DiMaggio. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
