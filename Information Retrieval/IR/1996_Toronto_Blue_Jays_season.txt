The 1996 Toronto Blue Jays season was the 20th season in franchise history. 
The season involved the Blue Jays finishing fourth in the American League 
East with a record of 74 wins and 88 losses. The Blue Jays had a losing 
record for the third consecutive season. A new tradition would start in 
1996 as the Blue Jays donned red uniforms for the first time. These uniforms 
would be worn only on Canada Day and would feature "Canada" on the back 
of their jerseys rather than a player's name. Eventual Cy Young Award winner 
Pat Hentgen would start the Canada Day match against the Baltimore Orioles. 
The final series of the season would be embroiled in controversy. Against 
the American League East champion Baltimore Orioles, two events would define 
the Orioles season. The game on Friday, September 27, 1996 would go down 
as one of the most infamous events in baseball history, as former Blue 
Jay Roberto Alomar would spit at umpire John Hirschbeck. The Sunday game 
would be a coming-out party for Brady Anderson, as he would hit his 50th 
home run of the regular season off Pat Hentgen. The total would break Frank 
Robinson's team record for most home runs in a season. 1996 also marked 
the end of an era for the Blue Jays, as they would redesign their logo 
and uniforms in the following year and also radically shake up their roster.
