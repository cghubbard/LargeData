The 2013 Los Angeles Dodgers season was the Dodgers' 124th for the franchise 
in Major League Baseball, and their 56th season in Los Angeles. The Dodgers 
dealt with a series of injuries to key players during the first half of 
the season and on June 21 were 31-42, 9 1/2 games back in last place in 
the NL West. Beginning with a 6-1 win over the San Diego Padres on June 
22, the return of the injured players, and the emergence of rookie Yasiel 
Puig, they went 46-10 through August 23 as the rest of the division collapsed. 
On September 19, they clinched the Western Division title. This was the 
earliest the Dodgers had ever clinched a title and the largest deficit 
they had ever overcome to win the division. They opened the playoffs by 
defeating the Atlanta Braves in the Division Series and advanced to the 
NL Championship Series. In the NLCS, they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals 
in six games. The Dodgers fired hitting coach Dave Hansen after the 2012 
season but retained the rest of their coaching staff for 2013.[1] On November 
7, the Dodgers hired Mark McGwire to be the new hitting coach.[2] On November 
13, the Dodgers promoted bullpen coach Ken Howell to assistant pitching 
coach and named Chuck Crim as the new bullpen coach. They also named John 
Valentin as assistant hitting coach.[3] After the 2012 season several Dodgers 
players became free agents: pitchers Joe Blanton, Randy Choate, Brandon 
League and Jamey Wright, infielder Adam Kennedy and outfielders Shane Victorino 
and Bobby Abreu.[4] The Dodgers also declined the 2013 contract options 
for pitcher Todd Coffey, backup catcher Matt Treanor and outfielder/first 
baseman Juan Rivera, making them free agents.[5] The Dodgers began their 
offseason by re-signing closer Brandon League to a three-year, $22.5 million 
contract.[6] On December 9, the Dodgers signed pitcher Hyun-jin Ryu to 
a six-year, $36 million contract after winning his rights from the Hanwha 
Eagles in the Korea Baseball Organization.[7] The Dodgers, on December 
10, signed the top free agent pitcher, Zack Greinke, to a six-year, $147 
million contract, the largest ever awarded to a right-handed pitcher.[8] 
They signed left-handed relief pitcher J. P. Howell to a one-year, $2.75 
million contract on January 8.[9] On December 12, the Dodgers acquired 
utility player Skip Schumaker from the St. Louis Cardinals for minor league 
shortstop Jake Lemmerman.[10] On December 19, they traded RHP John Ely 
to the Houston Astros in exchange for minor league LHP Rob Rasmussen.[11] 
Spring training began for the Dodgers on February 12, when pitchers and 
catchers reported to the team's spring training facility at Camelback Ranch 
in Glendale, Arizona. The Dodgers went into spring training with the lineup 
fairly set but a few issues remained to be worked out. The Dodgers had 
eight pitchers Clayton Kershaw, Chad Billingsley, Zach Greinke, Josh Beckett, 
Chris Capuano, Aaron Harang, Ted Lilly and Hyun-jin Ryu vying for five 
spots in the starting rotation.[12] Several Dodgers players participated 
in the 2013 World Baseball Classic held during spring training. Kenley 
Jansen played for the Netherlands, Ronald Belisario for Venezuela, Nick 
Punto for Italy, Luis Cruz and Adrian Gonzalez for Mexico, and Hanley Ramírez 
for the Dominican Republic, as well as minor leaguers Andres Santiago and 
Mario Santiago for Puerto Rico and Felipe Burin for Brazil. In the WBC 
Championship game, Ramirez injured his hand while diving for a ball. An 
MRI the next day revealed a torn thumb ligament which would require surgery. 
The Dodgers announced that he would miss the first two months of the season 
while recovering.[13] One of the big stories of spring training was the 
play of Cuban defector Yasiel Puig. He hit .526 in Cactus League games 
and there was talk that he might be able to make the opening day roster, 
despite being a "very raw" talent who had only briefly played in Class-A 
the year before. However, the club sent him to AA Chattanooga to start 
the season.[14] The Dodgers began the regular season at home on April 1 
against the San Francisco Giants. Clayton Kershaw made the opening day 
start for the third straight season and pitched a complete game shutout 
as the Dodgers won 4-0. Kershaw also hit his first career home run in the 
game, for the Dodgers' first run in the bottom of the 8th.[15] Korean pitcher 
Hyun-jin Ryu made his Major League debut the following day, allowing three 
runs (one earned) on 10 hits in 6 1/3 innings to pick up the 3-0 loss.[16] 
The Dodgers went 1 for 14 with runners in scoring position in the series 
finale, and Pablo Sandoval and Hunter Pence hit homers off Josh Beckett 
as the Giants won 5-3.[17] Zack Greinke made his Dodgers debut on April 
5, pitching a two-hitter for 6 1/3 innings in the Dodgers' 3-0 win. Andre 
Ethier hit a solo homer in the game.[18] In his second start of the season, 
Kershaw pitched seven shutout innings while striking out nine and only 
allowing two hits in the 1-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.[19] The 
Dodgers finished off their three-game sweep of the Pirates with a 6-2 win 
on April 7. Adrian Gonzalez had four RBI and Ryu picked up his first Major 
League win in the game.[20] The Dodgers began their first road trip of 
the season on April 9 at Petco Park against the San Diego Padres. The bullpen 
allowed 5 runs to score in the bottom of the 8th and the team lost 9-3.[21] 
In Game 2 of the Padres series, Chad Billingsley made his first start of 
the season and allowed only one run in six innings. Carl Crawford and A. 
J. Ellis both homered in the 4-3 win.[22] The Dodgers won the third game 
of the series, 3-2, thanks to a go-ahead pinch hit home run by Juan Uribe. 
However, pitcher Zack Greinke injured his left collarbone when Carlos Quentin 
charged the mound and tackled him to the ground after he was hit by a pitch.[23] 
Kershaw pitched well again in his next start, against the Arizona Diamondbacks, 
but the offense failed to score and the team lost 3-0.[24] Ryu struck out 
nine in six innings in his next start and also went 3 for 3 at the plate 
as the Dodgers beat the Diamondbacks 7-5.[25] Josh Beckett struck out nine 
in the next game and pitched a complete game, but the offense failed to 
score and he allowed the game-winning hit by Paul Goldschmidt in the bottom 
of the ninth of the 1-0 loss.[26] The Dodgers returned home on April 15 
for a Jackie Robinson Day game against the Padres. Eric Stults hit a three-run 
homer off Chad Billingsley and the Dodgers again were unable to get key 
hits and lost 6-3.[27] Chris Capuano made his first start of the season 
on April 16, replacing the injured Zack Greinke in the rotation. He struggled 
early, allowing four runs in the first inning and then left the game in 
the top of the third after suffering his own injury, a strained left calf. 
The Dodgers lost 9-2.[28] Kershaw picked up his 1,000th career strikeout 
when he fanned Yonder Alonso of the Padres in the 2nd inning on April 17. 
He became the youngest Dodger pitcher to reach that mark since Fernando 
Valenzuela. However, he struggled after that and the offense again failed 
to do much as the team lost 7-2. The Dodgers were swept at home by the 
Padres for the first time since 2006.[29] The Dodgers were rained out on 
April 19 at Camden Yards and forced to play a doubleheader the following 
day against the Baltimore Orioles. Their losing streak extended to six 
games after they lost both games of the doubleheader. In the first game, 
Andre Ethier hit a three-run homer in the first to stake the Dodgers to 
a 4-0 lead but Ryu allowed two home runs and the bullpen again failed as 
the team lost 7-5.[30] Manny Machado battered Beckett for a homer, double, 
single and 4 RBIs in the nightcap as the Orioles won 6-1.[31] The Dodgers 
woes continued when Chad Billingsley was scratched from his scheduled April 
20 start and placed on the disabled list due to pain in his elbow. Stephen 
Fife was recalled from AAA Albuquerque to make the start.[32] The Dodgers 
did manage to end the six-game losing streak with a 7-4 victory in the 
series finale.[33] Mark Ellis hit two home runs in the Dodgers 7-2 victory 
over the New York Mets at Citi Field on April 23.[34] Ted Lilly made his 
first start of the season the following day and held the Mets to 1 run 
on 6 hits in 5 innings while striking out 7. Matt Kemp also hit his first 
home run of the season. However, the Mets tied the game in the bottom of 
the ninth and then won it with a walk-off grand slam by Jordany Valdespin 
off of Josh Wall in the bottom of the 10th.[35] The Dodgers got a two run 
rally in the top of the ninth on the 25th to pick up a 3-2 win over the 
Mets in the final game of the road trip.[36] The Dodgers returned home 
on April 26 to begin a three-game weekend series with the Milwaukee Brewers. 
Adrian Gonzalez doubled twice and drove in 3 runs in the 7-5 victory. Mark 
Ellis left the game after five innings because of a strained right quad.[37] 
Fife was placed on the disabled list the next day and Matt Magill was called 
up from the minors to make his Major League debut. Magill allowed only 
two runs in 6 2/3 innings while striking out seven. However, Matt Guerrier 
allowed two home runs and they lost 6-4.[38] Clayton Kershaw struck out 
12 while pitching 8 shutout innings and Carl Crawford hit two homers as 
the Dodgers beat the Brewers 2-0 to win the series.[39] Ted Lilly allowed 
five runs in the first three innings in his next start and Josh Wall allowed 
seven more in 2 innings of relief as the Dodgers were crushed by the Colorado 
Rockies 12-2.[40] The Dodgers finished April with a 13–13 record after 
Ryu struck out 12 in 6 innings and Hanley Ramírez homered in his first 
start of the season after coming off the disabled list.[41] Josh Beckett 
fell to 0-4 on the season as the Dodgers lost to the Rockies 7-3 to start 
the month of May.[42] The Dodgers injury epidemic continued as Hanley Ramírez, 
after playing in just four games, injured his hamstring in the May 3 game 
against the San Francisco Giants at AT&T Park. Clayton Kershaw allowed 
only 3 hits and 1 run in 7 innings but the Giants won 2-1 on a walk-off 
home run by Buster Posey.[43] The following day, Matt Magill got pounded 
in his second start, allowing 5 runs in only 1.1 innings. The Dodgers fell 
behind 6-1 but came back to tie the game, partially thanks to Dee Gordon 
who tripled, stole two bases and scored two runs. However, they wound up 
losing 10-9 on a walk-off home run by Guillermo Quiróz in the 10th inning.[44] 
The Giants completed the sweep of the injury-riddled Dodgers the next day, 
4-3.[45] The team returned home to open a series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
Chris Capuano came off the disabled list to allow six runs in 4+ innings, 
Carl Crawford misplayed two balls in the outfield and the losing streak 
hit 5 in a 9-2 loss.[46] Paul Goldschmidt hit a two-run homer off Brandon 
League in the ninth on May 7 to send the Dodgers to their sixth straight 
loss 5-3. This was the second six-game losing streak of the season for 
the team, the first time that had happened since 1912.[47] Goldschmidt 
hit two more runs the next day as the Diamondbacks won 3-2. This was the 
first time the Dodgers had been swept in consecutive series since 2008.[48] 
The Dodgers combined for 10 hits on May 10 against the Miami Marlins, including 
a three-run homer by Adrian Gonzalez in the first inning. But it wasn't 
enough as they lost 5-4 to run the losing streak to 8.[49] Hyun-jin Ryu 
pitched well the next day, allowing only 1 run in 6.2 innings, as the Dodgers 
snapped their 8-game losing streak with a 7-1 win over the Marlins. Andre 
Ethier had 4 hits in 4 at-bats and Dee Gordon hit his 2nd career home run 
in the win.[50] Chris Capuano picked up his first win of the season on 
Mother's Day as Scott Van Slyke went 2 for 4 with a home run in the Dodgers 
5-3 win. Matt Kemp picked up his 1,000th career hit in the game, the fifth 
fastest Dodger to reach that mark.[51] Beckett struggled the next night, 
allowing 4 runs in only 3 innings of a 6-2 loss to the Washington Nationals.[52] 
Kershaw was back on the mound on May 14, striking out 11 in 8 2/3 scoreless 
innings. Andre Ethier provided a two-run single for the 2-0 win.[53] Zack 
Greinke returned from the disabled list to allow only one run in 5 1/3 
innings to get a 3-1 win over the Nationals in the final game of the homestand.[54] 
The Dodgers went back on the road on May 17 against the Atlanta Braves 
at Turner Field. Van Slyke hit two home runs in the first game but Paco 
Rodriguez allowed a grand slam home run to Justin Upton and the Braves 
won 8-5.[55] Chris Capuano pitched well the next day, taking a shutout 
into the 8th inning but reliever Kenley Jansen allowed back-to-back homers 
to Evan Gattis and Andrelton Simmons and the team lost again, 3-1.[56] 
The bullpen surrendered the lead again the next night as the Braves completed 
the sweep with a 5-2 win.[57] The Dodgers traveled to Miller Park for a 
series against the Milwaukee Brewers next. After 3 straight days of bullpen 
meltdowns, Clayton Kershaw picked the team up by pitching his 10th career 
complete game and only allowing 3 hits in a 3-1 victory. Ethier and Kemp 
homered in the win.[58] The team reverted to form the next day as they 
stranded 14 runners in scorring position and Zack Greinke struggled in 
a 5-2 defeat.[59] The offense finally came alive as the Dodgers wrapped 
up the road trip with a 9-2 win over the Brewers on May 22.[60] The Dodgers 
returned home on May 24 for a series against the St. Louis Cardinals amid 
media speculation that Manager Don Mattingly was in danger of losing his 
job.[61] The team didn't help his cause as they managed only 3 hits against 
Lance Lynn and lost 7-0.[62] Adrian Gonzalez had a homer, double and three 
RBI in a 5-3 victory over the Cardinals the following day.[63] Gonzalez 
homered and drove in 3 more the next day, but Kershaw had a rough outing 
allowing four runs, his most all season, in a 5-3 loss.[64] Continuing 
his hot streak, Gonzalez was 4 for 4 on May 27 against the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim as the Dodgers came back from a 6-1 deficit to win 8-7.[65] 
Hyun-Jin Ryu pitched a complete game shutout and Luis Cruz hit his first 
home run of the year in a 3-0 win over the Angels the following day in 
the final game of the homestand.[66] The Freeway series continued the next 
night at Angel Stadium, as Jered Weaver held the Dodgers offense in check 
and the Angels won 4-3.[67] The Angels took the finale to the series, 3-2, 
thanks to solid pitching by Jason Vargas and an RBI infield single by Chris 
Nelson.[68] The Dodgers concluded a tough month of May with a game at Coors 
Field against the Colorado Rockies. Kershaw pitched seven plus solid innings 
but Todd Helton two-run homer off closer Brandon League tied the game in 
the bottom of the ninth. The Dodgers rallied to score two in the tenth 
for their first extra inning win of the season, 7-5.[69] The Dodgers began 
June much the way they ended May. Ronald Belisario allowed a two-run homer 
to Michael Cuddyer in the seventh to blow the lead and then Dexter Fowler 
hit a walk-off single off Matt Guerrier in the 10th as the Rockies beat 
the Dodgers 7-6.[70] Matt Magill was called up from the minors to make 
a spot start on June 2 but he struggled. Magill became the first Major 
Leaguer since at least 1916 to allow at least nine walks and four homers 
in the same start as the Dodgers were crushed 7-2.[71] The Dodgers returned 
home to play the San Diego Padres. Stephen Fife was the second straight 
spot starter, allowing one run in 5 1/3 innings. Adrian Gonzalez and Scott 
Van Slyke each hit solo homers to account for all the Dodgers runs in the 
2-1 win. The story of the game however, was the debut of top prospect Yasiel 
Puig, who went 2 for 4 and threw out a runner at first from the warning 
track on a double play to end the game.[72] In the next game, Puig went 
3 for 4 with a double and two home runs to lead the team to a 9-7 victory. 
He was the first Dodger player in history with a multi-homer game in one 
of his first two games and the first with five RBI in one of his first 
two games since Spider Jorgensen in 1947.[73] However, he went 0 for 4 
with 2 strikeouts in the series finale as Jason Marquis no hit the Dodgers 
into the sixth inning and the Padres won 6-2 to keep the Dodgers in last 
place in the division.[74] Zack Greinke pitched seven scoreless innings 
on June 6 against the Atlanta Braves and Puig continued his hot start by 
blasting a grand slam home run in the eighth inning to blow open the Dodgers 
5-0 win.[75] Puig homered again the next day, and became only the second 
player in the modern era with four homers in his first five games and he 
tied the Major League record with 10 RBI in his first five games. Hyun-Jin 
Ryu allowed one run on six hits in 7 2/3 innings and the Dodgers won, 2-1, 
when pinch runner Skip Schumaker scored on a wild pitch by Anthony Varvaro 
in the bottom of the 10th.[76] The Braves won the next day, 2-1, as Kris 
Medlen pitched 6 2/3 scoreless innings and hit a solo homer. That was one 
of two homers allowed by Stephen Fife in the fifth inning.[77] Matt Magill 
made another emergency start on June 9 as Ted Lilly went back on the disabled 
list. He walked six and allowed seven runs in 3 2/3 innings as the Dodgers 
lost to the Braves 8-1.[78] Clayton Kershaw allowed only one run in seven 
innings on June 10 against the Arizona Diamondbacks but Brandon League 
was tagged for four runs in the ninth and the Dodgers lost 5-4. Puig had 
three hits on the day to move his batting average to .500 on the season. 
He became the first Dodger in history with 16 hits in his first eight games 
and the first with six multi-hit games in his first eight.[79] The Dodgers 
beat the Diamondbacks the next day as Tim Federowicz three-run double provided 
the difference in the 5-3 win. The game was marred by five hit batters, 
two bench clearing incidents, and six ejections of players and coaches.[80] 
The Dodgers ended their homestand with an 8-6 loss to the Diamondbacks 
in 12 innings on June 12.[81] Major League Baseball on June 14 announced 
the discipline for the fight between the Dodgers and Diamondbacks that 
took place a few days prior. Diamondbacks pitcher Ian Kennedy was suspended 
10 games and utility player Eric Hinske 5 games, while Dodgers utility 
player Skip Schumaker and relief pitcher J. P. Howell were suspended two 
games and Ronald Belisario one. In addition manager Don Mattingly and hitting 
coach Mark McGwire were suspended as well and several players were fined.[82] 
The Dodgers began a roadtrip at PNC Park on June 14 but the woes continued 
as Jeff Locke tossed seven shutout innings and the Pittsburgh Pirates won 
3-0.[83] The next day, Kershaw allowed only one run and three hits in seven 
innings, while striking out eight. However, the bullpen coughed up the 
lead yet again. This time the Dodgers managed to pull out the win 5-3 in 
11 innings.[84] A three-run home run by Pedro Álvarez off Greinke was the 
key to the Pirates' 6-3 win in the series finale.[85] The Dodgers were 
scheduled to begin a two-game series against the New York Yankees on June 
18, but a rain out forced the two teams to play a day-night doubleheader 
on June 19.[86] Hanley Ramírez had four hits, including a two-run homer 
in the first game, but the Dodgers committed four errors in the game and 
lost 6-4.[87] Chris Capuano came off the disabled list to pitch six shutout 
innings and Puig hit a home run to lead the Dodgers to a split of the doubleheader 
with a 6-0 win. Puig had 27 hits in his first 15 games, second most all-time.[88] 
After the game, they took a cross-country plane ride and opened a series 
against the Padres in San Diego. They lost 6-3 as the Padres defenders 
made several highlight reel plays and Pedro Ciriaco had an RBI triple and 
a two-run home run in the game.[89] The Dodgers committed two more errors 
the next day, tying the Houston Astros for the league lead. They lost 5-2.[90] 
Zack Greinke had his best start as a Dodger on June 22, holding the Padres 
to one run and four hits, while striking out eight in eight innings. Adrian 
Gonzalez and Haney Ramirez homered in the 6-1 victory.[91] Gonzalez and 
Ramirez hit back-to-back homers the following day to help the Dodgers split 
the series 3-1.[92] The Dodgers returned home on June 24, to open a series 
against the San Francisco Giants. Yasiel Puig went 3 for 4 with a home 
run and two RBI in the first game as the Dodgers won 3-1, their first three-game 
winning streak since they swept the Pirates on April 5–7.[93] They extended 
the streak to four games when they beat the Giants 6-5 the next day. Ramirez 
and Mark Ellis homered and Matt Kemp came off the disabled list to make 
a game-saving catch to end the game and preserve the win.[94] The Dodgers 
finished off the three-game sweep of the Giants with a 4-2 win on June 
26. Kershaw pitched 8+ innings and allowed only a two-run homer to Buster 
Posey, while striking out seven.[95] Puig delivered the go-ahead two-out, 
two-run single in the seventh inning as the Dodgers took the opener of 
a series from the Philadelphia Phillies to stretch the winning streak to 
six games.[96] The streak came to an abrupt end on June 28 as the Phillies 
erupted for 21 hits and 16 runs in a 16-1 shellacking of the Dodgers. It 
was the team's worst home loss since 1947 and the most runs allowed in 
a game since 2003.[97] Hanley Ramírez was 3 for 4 with a 3 run homer the 
following day, and also scored the winning run on a walk-off single by 
A. J. Ellis as the Dodgers won 4-3.[98] The Dodgers finished out their 
first winning month of the season with a 6-1 victory over the Phillies. 
Stephen Fife pitched seven shutout innings but the real story was Yasiel 
Puig who was 4 for 5 with a double and a triple to break Steve Sax's team 
record for most hits in a month by a rookie with 44. His total was also 
second most all-time among rookies in their first month, behind only Joe 
DiMaggio.[99] In their first July game, the Dodgers moved out of last place 
for the first time since May 5. Clayton Kershaw struck out eight and pitched 
a complete game shutout in the 8-0 victory over the Rockies at Coors Field.[100] 
The Dodgers won again the next night as Juan Uribe, Adrian Gonzalez, Hanley 
Ramírez and Matt Kemp all homered in the 10-8 win.[101] Gonzalez was 4 
for 5 with a homer in the series finale and Kemp also hit another homer, 
but Chris Capuano allowed 5 runs in 4 1/3 innings and the Rockies won the 
game, 9-5.[102] The Dodgers began a series with the Giants at AT&T Park 
on July 5. Uribe had a double, triple, homer and 7 RBI in the 10-2 win.[103] 
Three errors and an inability to mount any offense against Giants starter 
Madison Bumgarner led to the 4-2 loss the following day.[104] A. J. Ellis 
three-run double in the top of the ninth of Sergio Romo gave the Dodgers 
a 4-1 win on July 7.[105] Zack Greinke allowed only two hits and struck 
out seven in seven scoreless innings to lead the Dodgers to a 6-1 victory 
over the first place Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field.[106] Ricky Nolasco 
made his first start as a Dodger on July 9, after having been acquired 
in a trade with the Miami Marlins a few days prior. He allowed only one 
run on four hits in seven innings of work and the Dodgers again won 6-1.[107] 
Hanley Ramírez and A. J. Ellis hit back-to-back homers in the top of the 
14th inning as the Dodgers swept the Diamondbacks with a 7-5 win to climb 
back to .500 for the first time since April 30.[108] The Dodgers returned 
home on July 11 and extended their winning streak with a 6-1 victory over 
the Rockies. Capuano pitched 6.1 scoreless innings, while striking out 
a season-high eight and Mark Ellis was 3 for 4 with 4 RBI in the game.[109] 
The Dodgers' five-game winning streak came to an end when Juan Nicasio 
shut them out 3-0.[110] The Dodgers returned the favor the next day as 
Zack Greinke struck out nine and allowed only two hits in a 1-0 complete 
game shutout.[111] The Dodgers headed into the All-Star break with a 47–47 
record after losing 3-1 to split the series with the Rockies.[112] Kershaw 
was the Dodgers only representative at the 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game, and retired the three batters he faced in his one inning of work.[113] 
After the break, the Dodgers traveled to the nation's capital for a three-game 
series against the Washington Nationals. Hanley Ramírez hit a two-run homer 
and Andre Ethier a solo shot to account for all the team's runs in a 3-2 
win.[114] Ramírez's RBI double in the 10th inning capped a 3 for 5 night 
as the Dodgers took game 2 of the series, 3-1, on July 20.[115] Matt Kemp 
rejoined the Dodgers on July 21 after spending two weeks on the disabled 
list with a sore shoulder. In his return, he was 3 for 4 with a homer as 
the Dodgers drubbed the Nationals 9-2 to sweep the series.[116] The Dodgers 
moved into first place for the first time all season when they clobbered 
the Toronto Blue Jays 14-5 on July 22. A. J. Ellis set career highs with 
five RBI, four hits (including a homer), and three runs. Skip Schumaker 
also hit a three-run homer in the game.[117] The following day, the Dodgers 
fell behind 8-3 after 6 innings but came back and won 10-9. Adrian Gonzalez 
three-run homer in the eighth inning was the big blow.[118] They came from 
behind again the next day, closing out the road trip by scoring 5 runs 
in the top of the 10th with home runs by Mark Ellis and Yasiel Puig to 
win 8-3.[119] With the win the Dodgers set an L.A. Dodger record with their 
10th straight road win, something the Dodgers franchise hadn't done since 
1955. This was also the first time they had swept an interleague series 
(of three or more games) since 2003 and the first time they had scored 
eight or more runs in four straight games since 1985.[120] The Dodgers 
returned home on July 25 and dropped the opener of a four-game series against 
the Cincinnati Reds, 5-2. Mat Latos held the Dodgers to one run in 7 2/3 
innings, and Jay Bruce and Xavier Paul each homered to end the six-game 
winning streak.[121] Hanley Ramírez hit a two-run homer to back Clayton 
Kershaw's eight strikeouts in eight innings as the club won 2-1 in the 
second game of the series.[122] Hyun-jin Ryu dominated on July 27, striking 
out nine and allowing only one run on two hits in seven innings in the 
Dodgers' 4-1 victory over the Reds.[123] Puig hit a walk-off homer in the 
bottom of the 11th as the Dodgers took the series finale 1-0. A pitching 
duel between Chris Capuano and Tony Cingrani kept the game tied heading 
into extra innings. The 20 strikeouts by Dodgers batters in the game set 
a franchise record, breaking the mark set during a 15-inning game on May 
2, 1995 against the Giants.[124] Greinke stuck out 7 in 7 innings and Mark 
Ellis hit a walk-off RBI single in the ninth as the Dodgers beat the New 
York Yankees 3-2 on July 30.[125] Kershaw pitched eight shutout innings 
as the month came to a close, but Hiroki Kuroda also did not allow a run 
and the Yankees won 3-0 after scoring all their runs off the Dodgers bullpen 
in the top of the ninth.[126] The Dodgers traveled to Wrigley Field and 
started the month of August with a 6-4 victory over the Chicago Cubs, extending 
the road winning streak to 11.[127] The following day they won again 6-2, 
tying the all-time franchise record of 12 set by the 1924 Brooklyn Robins. 
Hyun-jin Ryu became the first Dodger rookie to win 10 games in a season 
since Kazuhisa Ishii in 2002.[128] A two-run single by Carl Crawford keyed 
the Dodgers' 3-0 win over the Cubs on August 3 to extend the streak to 
13, a new franchise record and the longest in the National League since 
the 1976 Phillies also won 13.[129] The team finished off a sweep of the 
Cubs with a 1-0 victory. Stephen Fife came off the DL to pitch 5 1/3 scoreless 
innings and Kenley Jansen pitched a scoreless ninth for his 17th save, 
and 25th consecutive batter he had retired in a row. This was the Dodgers' 
first four-game sweep at Wrigley Field since 1954.[130] Zack Greinke picked 
up his 100th career win in the Dodgers' 3-2 victory over the St. Louis 
Cardinals at Busch Stadium. He pitched 6 1/3 innings and drove in the eventual 
winning run with a single in the seventh.[131] A lack of clutch hitting 
led to the Dodgers first road loss in a month, a 5-1 loss to the Cardinals 
on August 7. The streak ended at 15, just two behind the all-time record 
set by the 1984 Tigers and 1916 Giants.[132] Cardinals starter Shelby Miller 
had to leave the next game after only two pitches due to injury and the 
Dodgers erupted for 6 runs in the second inning on their way to a 13-4 
win. Crawford had 4 hits from the leadoff spot and both Andre Ethier and 
Skip Schumaker had 3 hits and 4 RBI in the win.[133] Ryu struck out seven 
in seven innings while not walking a batter and allowing only one unearned 
run as the Dodgers completed a 7-1 road trip with a 5-1 win. A. J. Ellis 
delivered the big blow with a 3 run homer.[134] The Dodgers returned home 
on August 9 to begin an interleague series against the Tampa Bay Rays. 
In the opener, the Rays jumped out to a 6-0 lead and David Price allowed 
only one unearned run through his seven innings. However, the Dodgers rallied 
against the Rays bullpen with two runs in the eighth and four in the ninth 
to win 7-6.[135] Zack Greinke pitched 6 1/3 scoreless innings, Adrian Gonzalez 
homered, Skip Schumaker had four hits and the Dodgers won the second game 
of the series, 5-0.[136] Clayton Kershaw dominated in the series finale, 
striking out eight and allowing just 3 hits and 1 earned run in 8 strong 
innings, while driving in 2 runs on a second-inning single. The Dodgers 
won 8-2.[137] The next day, they beat the New York Mets 4-2 as Nick Punto 
homered and Gonzalez had three hits and an RBI. The Dodgers record of 38-8 
over their past 46 games was the franchise's best mark since the 1899 Brooklyn 
Superbas.[138] Ryu pitched another good game the following day, beating 
Mets ace Matt Harvey to pick up his 12th win in the Dodgers 4-2 victory.[139] 
On August 14, the Dodgers fell behind early 4-0 after 3 innings but again 
fought their way back and tied it up on a two-run pinch hit homer by Andre 
Ethier in the bottom of the ninth. Back-to-back doubles by Yasiel Puig 
and Gonzalez in the 12th gave them a 5-4 walk-off win. This was the 12th 
straight victory for the Dodgers in one-run games, a franchise record, 
and their 40th win in 48 games, the best mark in the Majors since the 1942 
St. Louis Cardinals.[140] The Dodgers traveled to the east coast to begin 
a road trip with the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park. Greinke 
and the bullpen shut out the Phillies and Hanley Ramírez hit a two-run 
homer in the 4-0 win.[141] Kershaw struck out 8 in 8 scoreless innings 
as the Dodgers shut out the Phillies again, 5-0 for their first 10-game 
win streak since 2006. The record of 42-8 over the past 50 games was the 
third best 50 game stretch in Major League history, behind only the 1906 
Cubs and 1912 Giants.[142] The streak was snapped the next day as Ramirez 
made two errors in the bottom of the ninth and the Phillies won 3-2.[143] 
The Dodgers lost consecutive games for the first time since June 20–21 
when they dropped the opener of a series against the Miami Marlins 6-2 
on August 19 at Marlins Park.[144] Yasiel Puig came off the bench and hit 
a solo homer to lead off the eighth inning as the Dodgers won the second 
game of the series, 6-4.[145] Greinke pitched another good game the next 
day, allowing only one run in eight innings as the Dodgers capitalized 
on 3 Marlins errors to win 4-1.[146] Kershaw followed that up by again 
pitching eight scoreless innings in the Dodgers 6-0 shutout of the Marlins 
to end the road trip.[147] The Dodgers began a three-game series against 
the American League East leading Boston Red Sox at Dodger Stadium on August 
24. Ricky Nolasco and John Lackey both pitched eight strong innings, and 
only five hits were allowed combined. Hanley Ramírez two-run homer in the 
4th was the only scoring in the 2-0 win for the Dodgers, which stretched 
their lead in the division to 10 1/2 games, the largest since 1977.[148] 
Ryu allowed 4 runs in the first inning the next day, with the big blow 
on a 3 run homer by Jonny Gomes and the Dodgers never recovered, losing 
4-2.[149] The Red Sox won the series finale 8-1, the Dodgers first series 
loss since June 14–16. They had won or tied 18 straight series, a franchise 
record.[150] Greinke got the Dodgers back on track after their two-game 
slide, pitching 8 2/3 innings against the Cubs and also hitting an RBI 
single in the 6-0 win.[151] The Dodgers offense was stymied by Cubs pitcher 
Travis Wood the next night and they lost 3-2. The team moved past 3 million 
in attendance this night, the first team in the Majors to reach that mark.[152] 
Nolasco pitched eight shutout innings, while striking out 11, and Ramirez 
and Ethier both homered in the 4-0 win on August 28. The Dodgers 8 shutout 
wins in the month of August was the most by any MLB team in one month since 
the Dodgers did it in September of 1988.[153] Yasiel Puig had four hits 
and Adrian Gonzalez hit two homers as the Dodgers pounded the San Diego 
Padres 9-2 on August 30, setting a new L.A. Dodgers record with 22 wins 
in a month, one shy of the franchise record set by the 1953 and 1957 Brooklyn 
Dodgers. Newly signed Edinson Vólquez made his Dodgers debut, the 26th 
pitcher the team used this season, setting a franchise record.[154] The 
Dodgers tied the franchise record for wins in a month the next day, as 
they finished August with a 2-1 win over the Padres.[155] The Dodgers started 
September with a 2-1 win to finish off a sweep of the San Diego Padres. 
Zack Greinke allowed one run on two hits and Yasiel Puig homered in the 
win.[156] Clayton Kershaw had a rare poor performance in the opener of 
a road series against the Colorado Rockies. He allowed 5 runs and a career-high 
11 hits, but the Dodger offense picked him up and the team continued winning, 
10-8.[157] Ricky Nolasco won his sixth straight decision, 7-4, on September 
3 as Nick Punto had four hits and Carl Crawford had three hits and two 
RBI.[158] The Dodgers dropped the series finale to the Rockies, 7-5, thanks 
to a poor first Dodger start by Edison Volquez, who allowed four runs in 
four innings of work.[159] The Dodgers next traveled to Great American 
Ball Park to begin a weekend series with the Cincinnati Reds. Chris Capuano 
left the game in the second inning with a groin strain and the Reds won 
3-2.[160] A walk-off single by Todd Frazier in the 10th inning gave the 
Reds a 4-3 victory on September 7, sending the Dodgers to their first three-game 
losing streak since June 8–10.[161] The Reds completed the sweep, 3-2, 
thanks to two home runs by Jay Bruce and a walk-off double by Ryan Hanigan.[162] 
The Dodgers returned home on September 9 and smacked the Arizona Diamondbacks 
8-1. Juan Uribe went had 4 hits, including 3 home runs, in 4 at-bats. He 
was the first Dodger to hit three homers in a game since Andre Ethier on 
June 26, 2009. The Dodgers as a team hit six homers in the game, the most 
since they hit seven against the Padres on September 16, 2006.[163] The 
team won again the next night, as Scott Van Slyke hit a pinch hit walk-off 
home run in the 11th inning to give the Dodgers a 5-3 win. This was the 
team's first walk off homer by a pinch hitter since Olmedo Sáenz in 2007.[164] 
Patrick Corbin kept the Dodgers offense in check the next day and the Diamondbacks 
won 4-1.[165] A walk-off single by Adrian Gonzalez in the 10th inning gave 
the Dodgers a 3-2 win over the San Francisco Giants on September 12.[166] 
Madison Bumgarner out pitched Kershaw as the Giants won the next game, 
4-2.[167] The Giants pounded the Dodgers 19-3 on September 15. The 19 runs 
was the most ever scored by one team at Dodger Stadium, the most allowed 
by the Dodgers in a game since May 5, 2001, at Chicago, and the worst Dodger 
home defeat since a July 3, 1947 loss to the Giants in Brooklyn.[168] Hunter 
Pence hit two homers in the Giants 4-3 win in the series finale. He hit 
five homeruns in total in the four game series, the first Giant to accomplish 
that feat against the Dodgers since Willie Mays.[169] The Dodgers traveled 
to Phoenix to begin a four-game series against the Diamondbacks, needing 
to win just two of them to clinch the Western Division title. In the opener, 
Hyun-Jin Ryu allowed only two hits in a complete game effort; however, 
one of those hits was a two-run homer by Paul Goldschmidt and they lost 
again 2-1.[170] Matt Kemp and Hanley Ramírez returned to the Dodgers' lineup 
on September 17 after missing time with injuries and both reached base 
four times as Uribe and Gonzalez homered. The Dodgers snapped the four-game 
losing streak with a 9-3 win.[171] They failed in their first chance to 
clinch the division when spot starter Stephen Fife didn't make it out of 
the third the next night and Ronald Belisario was pounded for five runs 
in relief. The Diamondbacks won 9-4.[172] The Dodgers clinched the National 
League West championship with a 7-6 win over the Diamondbacks on September 
19. Ramírez hit two home runs and A. J. Ellis hit the game-winning homer 
in the eighth inning for the Dodgers' first West title since 2009. The 
team's 9 1/2 game deficit on June 21 was the largest the Dodgers had ever 
overcome to win a division, and they were just the fourth team in MLB history 
to ever accomplish that feat.[173] The next day, the Dodgers rested all 
the regulars in the opening of a series at the San Diego Padres. The backups 
could not generate any offense and the Padres won 2-0.[174] Clayton Kershaw 
was brilliant the next day, pitching seven shutout innings while allowing 
just three hits and striking out ten. Yasiel Puig and A. J. Ellis both 
hit two-run homers in the 4-0 victory.[175] Zack Greinke pitched five shutout 
innings as the Dodgers wrapped up their series with the Padres with a 1-0 
win.[176] Hyun-jin Ryu allowed only one run in seven innings and Puig and 
Matt Kemp each hit solo homers as the Dodgers won the opener of their final 
road series of the season, 2-0, over the Giants.[177] Ricky Nolasco allowed 
six runs over 5 2/3 innings in his last start of the regular season, a 
6-4 loss to the Giants. It was his third straight poor start.[178] The 
Dodgers finished up their final road series of the regular season when 
Ángel Pagán homered off Paco Rodriguez to give the Giants a 3-2 victory.[179] 
Kershaw pitched six shutout innings in his final start of the regular season, 
an 11-0 win, on September 27. He finished the season with a Major League 
leading 1.83 ERA, making him the first pitcher to lead the league three 
years in a row since Greg Maddux in 1993–95. His ERA was the lowest for 
a starter since Pedro Martínez in 2000.[180] Greinke also pitched well 
in his final start, allowing only one run while striking out seven in six 
innings. However, the Dodgers were unable to score and lost the game, 1-0.[181] 
The Dodgers lost their final game of the regular season, 2-1, to the Rockies 
on September 29. They finished the season with a record of 92-70.[182] 
As National League West Champions, the Dodgers advanced to the 2013 NLDS 
to play the Eastern Division champion Atlanta Braves. They suffered a blow 
on the last day of the regular season when MRI results revealed that Matt 
Kemp had a severe ankle injury and would not be able to play in the post-season.[183] 
Andre Ethier was also dealing with an ankle injury and he was limited to 
pinch hitting in the division series.[184] In game 1 of the series, at 
Atlanta's Turner Field, Clayton Kershaw struck out 12 batters in 7 innings. 
That was the third most strikeouts by a Dodger pitcher in the playoffs, 
behind only Sandy Koufax (15 in the 1963 World Series) and Carl Erskine 
(14 in the 1953 World Series). His six straight strikeouts in the game 
tied an MLB post-season record set by Tim Belcher in game 2 of the 1988 
World Series. The Dodgers won the game 6-1.[185] The Braves tied up the 
series the next day, with a 4-3 win, as the Dodgers bullpen faltered. Hanley 
Ramírez homered and doubled twice in the game but it wasn't enough. Jason 
Heyward had a two-RBI single for the deciding runs.[186] The Dodgers offense 
took over in game 3 as they took the lead in the series with a 13-6 win 
at Dodger Stadium. Ramírez had two more extra base hits (a double and triple) 
in the game to tie the NLDS record and franchise record (Steve Garvey, 
Duke Snider) for most extra-base hits in the postseason. The 13 runs tied 
a franchise record set in the 1956 World Series.[187] The Dodgers brought 
Kershaw back on short rest in game 4 and he pitched six innings, while 
allowing only two unearned runs (thanks to two Adrian Gonzalez errors). 
Carl Crawford hit two solo homers in his first two at-bats, the first Dodger 
to do so in the playoffs since Shawn Green in the 2004 National League 
Division Series. An RBI double by José Constanza off Ronald Belisario in 
the 7th gave the Braves the lead, but the Dodgers went back up thanks to 
a two-run homer by Juan Uribe in the 8th off David Carpenter. Kenley Jansen 
closed it down in the ninth to preserve the 4-3 series clinching victory 
for the Dodgers.[188] The Dodgers advanced to the NLCS for the first time 
since 2009, where they faced off with the St. Louis Cardinals. In the first 
game of the series at Busch Stadium, Zack Greinke allowed only two runs 
in eight innings, while striking out a season high 10 batters, the first 
pitcher to strike out 10 Cardinals in a post-season game since Denny Galehouse 
in the 1944 World Series. Andre Ethier, making his first post-season start 
of the season after being limited to pinch hitting the previous round, 
just missed catching Carlos Beltrán's double at the fence to allow the 
two runs to score in the third. The Dodgers also managed two runs, on a 
single by Juan Uribe in the top of the third. The game remained tied into 
extra innings until Beltran recorded the walk-off hit off Kenley Jansen 
in the bottom of the 13th inning to give the Cardinals a 3-2 victory. This 
was the longest game in Dodgers post-season history since the 1916 World 
Series.[189] In the second game, Clayton Kershaw and two relievers combined 
to allow only 2 hits and 1 run but that was enough as the Dodgers offense 
failed to score at all and they lost 1-0. Kershaw was the first starting 
pitcher in post-season history to lose a game while allowing no earned 
runs and two or fewer hits.[190] Hanley Ramírez sat out game two after 
getting hit by a pitch in the first game and was diagnosed with a fractured 
rib. However, he was back in the lineup for Game three at Dodger Stadium 
and had two hits and an RBI. Yasiel Puig snapped an 0 for 11 streak with 
an RBI triple and Hyun-jin Ryu pitched seven shutout innings as the Dodgers 
picked up their first victory of the series with a 3-0 victory.[191] Ricky 
Nolasco got his first post-season start the next day and he allowed three 
runs in the third, on an RBI double by Matt Carpenter and a booming 2-run 
home run by Matt Holliday. Ramírez tried to play through the pain again, 
but struck out three times and was in noticeable pain when he was taken 
out in the seventh inning. The Dodgers offense again struggled to score 
runs and they lost 4-2 to fall to the brink of elimination.[192] Greinke 
responded with seven strong innings in Game Five and the Dodgers offense 
came alive. The team hit four home runs, including two by Adrian Gonzalez 
and held on to win 6-4, sending the series back to St. Louis. The four 
homers tied a Dodger post-season record that had previously been accomplished 
in Game 2 of the 1977 World Series and Game 1 of the 1978 NLCS.[193] In 
Game Six, Kershaw struggled from the start and he allowed seven runs on 
ten hits in four innings, his shortest start of the year. NLCS MVP Michael 
Wacha shut out the Dodgers for the second time in the series and the Dodgers 
season came to an end with a 9-0 blowout loss.[194] Infielders Outfielders

The Dodgers selected 40 players in this draft. Of those, only one of them, 
pitcher José De León, has played Major League Baseball as of the 2016 season. 
The first round draft pick was right-handed pitcher Chris Anderson from
