Benjamin Michael Kauff (January 5, 1890 – November 17, 1961)[1] was a professional 
baseball player, who played centerfield and batted and threw left-handed.[2] 
Kauff was known as the "Ty Cobb of the Feds." Though he appears on many 
lists of Jewish baseball players, such as Harry Stein's 1976 Esquire magazine 
article "All Time All-Star Argument Starter", Kauff was not Jewish.[3] 
Kauff was banned from baseball in 1921 amid charges of auto theft; despite 
his acquittal, baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis refused to 
overturn the ban. Kauff played his first game in the majors with the New 
York Highlanders on April 20, 1912. He played only five games with the 
Highlanders before being sent down to the minors.[2] After spending the 
1913 season in the minors, he appeared with the Indianapolis Hoosiers of 
the short-lived third major league, the Federal League.[1] Indianapolis 
rode his league-leading bat to the first league crown in 1914,[4] but traded 
him to the Brooklyn Tip-Tops before the 1915 season.[1] The Tip-Tops, unable 
to capitalize on Kauff's hitting, finished seventh in the Federal League's 
second, and last, season.[5] Kauff was called "Ty Cobb of the Feds" for 
his dominant hitting during both years of the Federal League's existence. 
In 1914, he led the league in batting average (.370; still the rookie record 
for league-leading batting average), on-base percentage (.447), runs (120), 
hits (211), total bases (305), doubles (44) and stolen bases (75), while 
finishing 2nd in slugging percentage (.534) and 3rd in RBIs (95) and walks 
(72).[4] He followed with an almost equally impressive season in 1915. 
That year he led the Federal League in batting average (.342), obp (.446), 
slugging percentage (.509) and steals (55) while finishing 2nd in walks 
(85), 3rd in home runs (12) and 4th in RBIs (83), runs (92) and hits (165).[5] 
When the Federal League folded after just two seasons, the National League 
New York Giants purchased his contract from Brooklyn for $35,000 ($762,000 
today). Kauff was a Giant from 1916 to 1920, winning the pennant in 1917,[6] 
but never regained his Federal League hitting prowess.[1] On May 26, 1916, 
he earned the dubious distinction of being the only player in the 20th 
century to be picked off first base three times in one game.[7] But also 
in his first year as a Giant, he was 2nd in the NL in stolen bases (40) 
and triples (16), 4th in RBIs (74), home runs (9) and walks (68), and 9th 
in slugging percentage (.408).[1] His best season in the National League 
was 1917, when he was 3rd in runs (89) and stolen bases (30), 4th in batting 
average (.308), 5th in OBP (.479), 6th in hits (172), and 7th in RBIs (68) 
and walks (59).[1] That year the Giants made it to the World Series, but 
lost to the Chicago White Sox 4–2,[8] in Chicago's last World Series victory 
until 2005.[9] His best Series performance was in Game 4, with two home 
runs and three RBI in the Giants' 5–0 victory.[10] His 1918 campaign was 
shortened by service in World War I.[11] In 1919, he led the NL in extra-base 
hits (44) and was 2nd in home runs (10), 4th in RBIs (67) and doubles (27), 
5th in runs (73) and 7th in slugging percentage (.422).[1] In December 
of that year, however, Kauff and his brother were implicated in a car theft. 
According to the criminal complaint, Kauff and two of his employees, James 
Shields and James Whalen, sold a car to Ignatz Engel after stealing it 
and giving it a new paint job.[12] Kauff adamantly denied the charges, 
claiming he didn't know the car was stolen.[13] Specifically, he claimed 
that Shields and Whalen had given him what turned out to be a false bill 
of sale, thus leading him to believe the car had been acquired legally.[12] 
After only 55 games in 1920, the Giants traded him to Toronto of the International 
League.[6] Kauff was slated to return to the Giants in 1921, but Baseball 
Commissioner Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis suspended Kauff until his auto 
theft case was resolved. The case finally went to trial on May 10, 1921. 
Kauff argued that he had not only been deceived by his employees, but also 
presented evidence that showed he had been eating dinner with his wife 
at the time the car was stolen. The jury acquitted Kauff on May 13 after 
deliberating for less than an hour.[14] Nonetheless, Landis refused to 
reinstate him. In a letter to Kauff, Landis said that even though he was 
acquitted, the trial revealed serious questions about his character and 
reputation that would raise questions about baseball's integrity if he 
were ever allowed to play again. He also told baseball writer Fred Lieb 
that he personally believed Kauff was guilty, and claimed his acquittal 
"smelled to high heaven" and was "one of the worst miscarriages of justice 
that ever came under my observation." [13] According to Kauff's attorney, 
Emil Fuchs (who would go on to own the Boston Braves), another factor in 
Landis' refusal to reinstate Kauff was that Kauff tried to compensate Engel 
for the purchase price of the car after finding out it was stolen—something 
which Kauff had done on Fuchs' advice.[14] Kauff appealed his banishment 
in court on the basis of his acquittal, but to no avail.[6] On January 
17, 1922, he lost his appeal to a higher court.[15] Even though banned 
from playing, he served as a baseball scout for 22 years before becoming 
a clothing salesman for John R. Lyman Co.[13] He died on November 17, 1961,
