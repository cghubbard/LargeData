Darrell Dean Johnson (August 25, 1928 – May 3, 2004) was an American Major 
League Baseball catcher, coach, manager and scout. As a manager, he led 
the 1975 Boston Red Sox to the American League pennant, and was named "Manager 
of the Year" by both The Sporting News[1] and the Associated Press.[2] 
Johnson was born in Horace, Nebraska, and graduated from Harvard, Nebraska, 
High School in 1944. He was signed by the St. Louis Browns as an amateur 
free agent in 1949 and made his Major League debut with the Browns on April 
20, 1952. A reserve catcher during his six-year Major League career (1952; 
1957–58; 1960–62), Johnson also played for the Chicago White Sox, New York 
Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies, Cincinnati Reds and 
Baltimore Orioles, who released him on June 12, 1962, ending his playing 
career. He was listed as 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and 180 pounds (82 kg) 
and threw and batted right-handed. In 134 MLB games played, he batted .234 
lifetime, with his 75 hits including six doubles, one triple and two home 
runs. Johnson's playing career was interrupted by an eleven-month stint 
as an MLB coach with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1960–61. After playing 
in eight games, with three plate appearances, for the 1960 Cardinals, he 
was released as a player on August 5 and added to the coaching staff of 
manager Solly Hemus, then reappointed for 1961. When the Redbirds fired 
Hemus on July 6, 1961, Johnson was released along with him. Three days 
later, he signed a player's contract with the last-place Philadelphia Phillies 
and caught 21 games for them in five weeks before being sold to the pennant-contending 
Cincinnati Reds on August 14. The Reds were then 2½ games behind the first-place 
Los Angeles Dodgers, but over the final six weeks of the season they overtook 
the Dodgers to win the National League championship by four full contests. 
Johnson appeared in 20 games (including 17 as the club's starting catcher, 
with the Reds going 8–9).[3] In limited duty, he batted .315 with 17 hits, 
including his second and last big-league home run, hit off the Dodgers' 
Johnny Podres on August 16.[4] He appeared in the 1961 World Series against 
his former team, the Yankees, and had two singles in four at bats (both 
of them off Baseball Hall of Famer Whitey Ford) as the Reds lost to the 
slugging Yanks of Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle, four games to one. He 
started Games 1 and 4, both of them Cincinnati defeats.[5] The Reds released 
Johnson only a few days into the 1962 season, and he signed with the Orioles 
as a backup catcher before retiring as a player in June and serving out 
the year as Baltimore's bullpen coach. He then became a minor league manager 
in the Oriole system and won championships with the Rochester Red Wings 
of the Triple-A International League (1964) and Elmira Pioneers of the 
Double-A Eastern League (1966). After a year scouting for the 1967 Yankees, 
he was named pitching coach of the defending American League champion Red 
Sox under Dick Williams for 1968. When Williams was fired in September 
1969, Johnson was retained by the Red Sox as a scout in 1970,[6] then managed 
Boston's Louisville Colonels International League affiliate in 1971–72. 
In 1973, he became the first manager of the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox, 
finishing 78–68 and winning his second Governors' Cup, emblematic of the 
International League's playoff championship, in his only PawSox season. 
That championship earned him a promotion to the parent club as Red Sox 
manager. As a big-league manager, Johnson led three different teams over 
eight seasons. His biggest success came during his first posting, as manager 
of the Red Sox from 1974 through 1976, when he compiled a win-loss record 
of 220–188 for a .539 winning percentage. He guided Boston to a 95–65 (.594) 
mark in 1975 and a first-place finish in the AL East. The Sox then swept 
the defending world champion Oakland Athletics in the playoffs, 3–0, to 
win the American League pennant. But they lost to the Cincinnati "Big Red 
Machine" in the thrilling 1975 World Series, four games to three. In 1976, 
Boston started poorly, losing 15 of its first 21 games, then rallied and 
finally climbed above the .500 mark on July 6 (38–37). As the incumbent 
pennant-winning manager, Johnson skippered the 1976 American League All-Star 
team (with the Junior Circuit losing 7–1 at Veterans Stadium on July 13). 
But by then the Red Sox were mired in another slump and only five days 
later, on July 18, Johnson was fired in favor of Don Zimmer after the team 
had lost eight of its last 11 games. At the time of his dismissal, Boston 
was out of contention with a 41–45 record, in fifth place and 13 games 
behind the Yankees. Johnson then briefly scouted for the Red Sox before 
he was appointed the first skipper of the expansion Seattle Mariners, where 
he served from their inception in 1977 to August 3, 1980, and posted a 
win-loss mark of 226–362 (.384). After his firing in Seattle in 1980, he 
was the third-base coach for the Texas Rangers, under Zimmer, starting 
in 1981 before taking over as interim manager on July 30, 1982.[7] Six 
years earlier, the roles had been reversed when third-base coach Zimmer 
succeeded Johnson as manager in Boston on July 18, 1976. In his final managerial 
role, Johnson's Rangers went 26–40 (.394) in the 1982 season's final two 
months. He finished with a 472–590 record for a .444 career percentage 
as an American League skipper.[8] He then moved to the New York Mets as 
minor league coordinator of instruction and a longtime scout. He also served 
as the Mets' bench coach on the staff of Dallas Green from May 20, 1993,[9] 
through the end of that season.[10] Johnson died at 75 of leukemia in Fairfield,
