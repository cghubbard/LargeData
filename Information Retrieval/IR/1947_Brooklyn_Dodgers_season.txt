On April 15, Jackie Robinson was the opening day first baseman for the 
Brooklyn Dodgers, becoming the first black player in Major League Baseball 
since 1884. Robinson went on to bat .297, score 125 runs, steal 29 bases 
and be named the very first Rookie of the Year. The Dodgers won the National 
League title and went on to lose to the New York Yankees in the 1947 World 
Series. This season was dramatized in the movie 42. Due to the suspension 
of Leo Durocher for a year for "conduct detrimental to baseball", coach 
Clyde Sukeforth managed the first 2 games of the season on an emergency 
basis, but declined to manage for the full season, so Burt Shotton took 
over as manager for the rest of the season. The Dodgers had a home attendance 
of 1.8 million paying fans, a National League record at the time.[6] On 
road, the Dodgers drew 1.9 million paying fans, also a National League 
record at that time. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Coaches
