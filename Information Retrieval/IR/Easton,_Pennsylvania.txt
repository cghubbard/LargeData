Easton is a city in and the county seat of Northampton County, Pennsylvania, 
United States.[1] The city's population was 26,800 as of the 2010 census.[2] 
Easton is located at the confluence of the Delaware River and the Lehigh 
River, roughly 55 miles (89 km) north of Philadelphia and 70 miles (110 km) 
west of the city of New York. Easton is the easternmost city in the Lehigh 
Valley, a region of 731 square miles (1,893 km2) that is home to more than 
800,000 people. Together with Allentown and Bethlehem, the Valley embraces 
the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton metropolitan area, including Lehigh, Northampton, 
and Carbon counties within Pennsylvania, and Warren County in the adjacent 
state of New Jersey. Easton is the smallest of the three Lehigh Valley 
cities, with approximately one-fourth of the population of the largest 
Lehigh Valley city, Allentown. In turn, this metropolitan area comprises 
Pennsylvania's third-largest metropolitan area and the state's largest 
and most populous contribution to the greater New York City metropolitan 
area. The city is split up into four sections: Historic Downtown, which 
lies directly to the north of the Lehigh River, to the west of the Delaware 
River, continuing west to Sixth Street; The West Ward, which lies between 
Sixth and Fifteenth Streets; The South Side, which lies south of the Lehigh 
River; and College Hill, a neighborhood on the hills to the north which 
is the home of Lafayette College. The boroughs of Wilson, West Easton, 
and Glendon are also directly adjacent to the city; the first and largest 
of which, Wilson, partially aligns in the same North-South Grid as the 
city of Easton. The greater Easton area consists of the city, three townships 
(Forks, Palmer, and Williams), and three boroughs (Glendon, West Easton, 
and Wilson). Centre Square, the town square of the city's Downtown neighborhood, 
is home to the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument, a memorial for Easton area 
veterans killed during the American Civil War. The Peace Candle, a candle-like 
structure, is assembled and disassembled every year atop the Civil War 
monument for the Christmas season.[3] The Norfolk Southern Railway's Lehigh 
Line (formerly the main line of the Lehigh Valley Railroad), runs through 
Easton on its way to Bethlehem and Allentown heading west and to Phillipsburg, 
New Jersey just across the Delaware River. The Lenape Native Americans 
originally referred to the area as "Lechauwitank", or "The Place at the 
Forks". The site of the future city was part of the land obtained from 
the Delawares by the Walking Purchase.[4][citation needed] Thomas Penn 
set aside a 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) tract of land at the confluence of the 
Lehigh and Delaware rivers for a town. Easton was settled by Europeans 
in 1739 and founded in 1752,[5] and was so named at the request of Penn; 
he had recently married Juliana Fermor, the daughter of Lord Pomfret whose 
estate was called Easton Neston, near Towcester, Northamptonshire, England.[citation 
needed] As Northampton County was being formed at this time, Easton was 
selected as its county seat. During the French and Indian War, the Treaty 
of Easton was signed here by the British colonial government of the Province 
of Pennsylvania and the Native American tribes in the Ohio Country, including 
the Shawnee and Lenape. Easton was an important military center during 
the American Revolutionary War.[citation needed] During the Revolutionary 
War, Easton had a military hospital.[6] On 18 June 1779, General John Sullivan 
led 2,500 Continentals from Easton to engage British Indian allies on the 
frontier.[7] Easton was one of the first three places the Declaration of 
Independence was publicly read (along with Philadelphia and Trenton). It 
is claimed that the Easton flag was flown during that reading,[8] making 
it one of the first "Stars and Stripes" to fly over the colonies.[9] This 
flag was used by a militia company during the War of 1812, and currently 
serves as Easton's municipal flag. Sited at the confluence of the rapidly 
flowing Lehigh River's waters with the more stately waters of the deeper 
wider Delaware, Easton became a major commercial center during the canal 
and railroad periods of the 19th century, when it would become a transportation 
hub for the eastern steel industry. The Delaware Canal, was quickly built 
soon after the lower Lehigh Canal (1818) became effective in regularly 
and reliably delivering much needed anthracite coal, into more settled 
lands along the rivers. And eventually the Morris would also serve to connect 
the rapidly developing Coal Regions to the north and west, to the fuel 
starved iron works to the west, the commercial port of Philadelphia to 
the south, and to the many home owners seeking fuel for heat within Pennsylvania, 
Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware and New York. Seeing other ways of exploiting 
the new fuel source, other entrepreneurs quickly moved to connect across 
the Delaware River reaching into the New York City area to the east via 
a connection with the Morris Canal in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, so the 
town became a canal nexus or hub from which the Coal from Mauch Chunk reached 
the world. The early railroads were often built to parallel and speed shipping 
along transportation corridors, and by the late 1860s the Lehigh and Susquehanna 
Railroad (LH&S) and Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR) were built to augment 
the bulk traffic through the canals and provide lucrative passenger travel 
services. The LVRR, known as 'the Black Diamond Line' would boast the twice 
daily "Black Diamond Express" daily passenger trains to and from New York 
City and Buffalo, New York via Easton. The Central Railroad of New Jersey 
(CNJ), would lease and operate the LH&S tracks from the 1870s until the 
Conrail consolidations absorbed both the Central Railroad of New Jersey 
and Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1966. Today, the Lehigh Valley Railroad's 
main line is the only major rail line that goes through Easton and is now 
known as the Lehigh Line; the Lehigh Line is currently owned by Norfolk 
Southern Railway since 1999. Canal transportation was largely replaced 
by railroads in the mid-19th century with Easton being a hub for five railroads 
including the Jersey Central, Lehigh Valley Railroad and others. Easton 
lost its prominence in passenger transportation with the rise of the automobile 
in the mid-20th century.[citation needed] The development of improved logistics, 
transfer and handling methods lead to other regions profiting from freight 
transportation rather than Easton. Like the Pennsylvania Dutch region to 
the southwest, Easton has a strong German heritage. The Pennsylvania Argus, 
a German-language newspaper, was published in Easton until 1917.[citation 
needed] As part of their heritage, the Germans put up one of the continent's 
earliest Christmas trees in Easton; Daniel Foley's book states that "Another 
diary reference unearthed recently makes mention of a tree set-up at Easton, 
Pennsylvania, in 1816."[10] There is a plaque in Scott Park (along the 
Delaware River) commemorating this event. Historians of angling believe 
that Samuel Phillipe, an Easton gunsmith, invented the six-strip split-cane 
Bamboo fly rod. A Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission plaque 
near Center Square commemorates this event.[11] Easton is located at 40°41′18″N 
75°12′59″W﻿ / ﻿40.68833°N 75.21639°W﻿ / 40.68833; -75.21639 (40.688248, 
−75.216458).[12] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city 
has a total area of 4.7 square miles (12 km2), of which, 4.3 square miles 
(11 km2) is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km2) (8.39%) is water, including 
Bushkill Creek and the Lehigh and Delaware rivers. Downtown Easton lies 
at the confluence of the Lehigh River and Delaware River and is a low-lying 
area surrounded by hills to the north, west, and south. North of downtown 
is College Hill, the home of Lafayette College. South Easton, divided by 
the Lehigh River from the rest of the city, was a separate borough until 
1898; it was settled initially by Native Americans, later by canal workers, 
and then was later the home of several silk mills.[citation needed] Easton 
experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification 
Dfa) or humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa) depending 
on the January isotherm used (26.6 °F or 32 °F), although lying closer 
to the former. Summers are usually hot and very muggy, averaging in the 
mid-80s during the day, though the high humidity makes it feel much warmer. 
Fall and spring months are typically mild, offering many days in the mid-60s, 
as well as stronger winds. Winters are usually very cold and produce about 
30 inches of snow As of the 2010 census, the city was 67.2% White, 16.8% 
Black or African American, 0.4% Native American, 2.4% Asian, 0.1% Native 
Hawaiian, and 4.9% were two or more races. 19.9% of the population were 
of Hispanic or Latino ancestry.[18] As of the census[19] of 2000, there 
were 26,263 people, 9,544 households, and 5,735 families residing in the 
city. The population density was 6,168.4 per square mile (2,380.3/km2). 
There were 10,545 housing units at an average density of 2,476.7 per square 
mile (955.7/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 78.48% White, 12.71% 
African American, 0.24% Native American, 1.66% Asian, 0.11% Pacific Islander, 
3.67% from other races, and 3.13% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino 
of any race were 9.79% of the population. The increase in Hispanic/Latinos—from 
less than 10% of the population in the 2000 census, to nearly 20% in the 
2010 census, is a significant change in the city's demographics. The growth 
in Hispanic residents is similar to increases in Allentown and Bethlehem, 
the two other major cities in the Lehigh Valley. There were 9,544 households, 
out of which 30.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 37.7% 
were married couples living together, 16.6% had a female householder with 
no husband present, and 39.9% were non-families. 31.5% of all households 
were made up of individuals, and 11.0% had someone living alone who was 
65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.46 and the average 
family size was 3.10. In the city the population was spread out, with 23.3% 
under the age of 18, 16.3% from 18 to 24, 29.9% from 25 to 44, 18.6% from 
45 to 64, and 11.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 
32 years. For every 100 females there were 97.4 males. For every 100 females 
age 18 and over, there were 96.1 males. The median income for a household 
in the city was $33,162, and the median income for a family was $38,704. 
Males had a median income of $32,356 versus $23,609 for females. The per 
capita income for the city was $15,949. About 12.3% of families and 16.0% 
of the population were below the poverty line, including 21.3% of those 
under age 18 and 11.2% of those age 65 or over. Easton operates a mayor-in-council 
city government. Residents elect a city controller, six city councilpersons 
and a mayor who is also a voting member of the city council. All of these 
officials are elected to four-year terms.[20][21] The incumbent mayor, 
Democrat Sal Panto, Jr., was re-elected to his second consecutive term 
in 2011; he had previously served two terms as mayor during the 1980s.[22] 
Easton is part of Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district, represented 
in the United States House of Representatives by Democrat Matt Cartwright, 
first elected to this office in 2012. Major state, federal, or interstate 
highways include: Major east−west roads (from north to south) include: 
Major north−south roads (from west to east) include: The Easton Area School 
District serves the residents of the city of Easton along with Forks and 
Palmer Townships and the village of Martins Creek to the north. As of the 
2000 census, the combined population of the municipalities in the Easton 
Area School District was 53,554. The school district has seven elementary 
schools (Cheston, Forks, March, Palmer, Paxinosa, Shawnee and Tracy) for 
grades K-4, Easton Area Middle School Campus (in Forks Township) for grades 
5–8, and Easton Area High School (in Palmer Township) for grades 9–12. 
Total student enrollment is about 9000 students in all grades. There is 
also an alternative school called Easton Academy. Easton Area High School 
is known[23] for its long-standing athletic rivalry with Phillipsburg High 
School in neighboring Phillipsburg, New Jersey. The two teams play an annual 
football game on Thanksgiving Day that is considered one of the largest 
and longest-standing rivalries in American high school football. 2006 marked 
the 100th year anniversary of the Easton-Phillipsburg high school football 
rivalry[23] The game, which was shown on ESPN, was won by Easton. In 2009, 
Easton was the location of the Gatorade REPLAY Game in which the 1993 teams 
from the Easton vs. P-Burg Game met again to resolve the game, which ended 
in a 7–7 tie. The REPLAY Game was won by Phillipsburg, 27-12.[24] Easton 
Area High School athletes compete in the Lehigh Valley Conference, which 
consists of the 12 largest high schools in the Lehigh Valley. Easton holds 
the third most LVIAC championships in all sports, behind only Parkland 
High School and Emmaus High School.[25] Easton is also home to Catholic 
Notre Dame High School. Easton is the home of one four-year college, Lafayette 
College, which was established in 1826. Before the American Civil War, 
Easton was the location of Union Law School, which was founded in 1846 
and seems to have foundered fairly soon after the 1856 death of its founder, 
judge Washington McCartney. (While at least one student, future Wisconsin 
state senator Robert L. D. Potter, graduated in the spring of 1857, a historian 
in 2000 dismissed Union in an endnote as "a one-man operation that died 
with him" [i.e., McCartney].[26]) Easton's Two Rivers Landing is the home 
of two interactive children's museums, the National Canal Museum, which 
focuses on the importance of canals in the region, and the Crayola Factory, 
which is owned by Crayola LLC (formerly known as Binney & Smith), a major 
toy manufacturer based in nearby Forks Township. The global headquarters 
for Victaulic is also based in nearby Forks Township. The city was also 
once the home of Dixie Cup Corporation, the manufacturer of Dixie Cups 
and other consumer products. Majestic Athletic, current provider of uniforms 
for Major League Baseball, is based in Easton. The Lehigh Valley Railroad, 
Central Railroad of New Jersey using the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad, 
Lehigh and Hudson River Railway and Conrail are Easton's major defunct 
railroads that operated in Easton. The Norfolk Southern Railway is now 
the city's only major railroad in Easton. Easton's daily newspaper is The 
Express-Times. The Morning Call, based in Allentown, also is widely read 
in the city. Easton is part of the Philadelphia DMA, but also receives 
numerous radio and television channels from New York City, as well as the 
smaller Scranton-Wilkes-Barre media market to the northwest. Two television 
stations are based the Easton area: PBS affiliate WLVT Channel 39 in Bethlehem, 
and independent station WFMZ Channel 69 in Allentown. Four radio stations 
are based in Easton: WEEX, a sports radio station broadcasting at 1230 
AM, WODE-FM "The Hawk", a classic rock station broadcasting at 99.9 FM, 
WCTO "Cat Country 96," a country music station broadcasting on 96.1 FM, 
and WJRH, a Lafayette College radio station broadcasting at 104.9 FM. In 
addition, WDIY-FM, a National Public Radio affiliate located in Bethlehem, 
maintains a translator in Easton broadcasting at 93.9 FM. Easton was once 
served only by the 215 area code from 1947 (when the North American Numbering 
Plan of the Bell System went into effect) until 1994. In response to southeastern 
Pennsylvania's growing telecommunication demand, Easton telephones exchanges 
were switched to area code 610 in 1994. An overlay area code, 484, was 
added to the 610 service area in 1999.[27] Easton is served by I-78, US 
22, PA 33, PA 248 and PA 611. Trans-Bridge Lines provides regular bus service 
to New York City. Air transport to and from Easton is available through 
Lehigh Valley International Airport, which is located approximately 15 
miles (24 km) west of the city, in Hanover Township. Bus transportation 
is provided by LANTA Metro bus services. Easton has no passenger rail service. 
Until 1983 New Jersey Transit's Raritan Valley Line terminated at Phillipsburg, 
New Jersey, on the other side of the Delaware River from Easton. The line 
now stops at High Bridge, New Jersey, roughly 20 miles (32 km) to the east. 
Under NJT's I-78 Corridor study this service would be restored. The former 
Lehigh Valley Railroad main line, the Lehigh Line, travels through Easton
