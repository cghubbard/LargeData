Dellos Clinton Gainer (November 10, 1886 – January 29, 1947), nicknamed 
"Sheriff," was an American baseball player. A native of West Virginia, 
Gainer played professional baseball, primarily as a first baseman, for 
21 years from 1909 to 1929, including 10 seasons in Major League Baseball 
for the Detroit Tigers (1909, 1911-1914), Boston Red Sox (1914-1917, 1919), 
and St. Louis Cardinals (1922). In his first full year in the major leagues, 
he drew praise for his fielding and was batting .302 when he was struck 
by a pitched ball and sustained a broken wrist. Gainer suffered from the 
wrist injury and other injuries over the next several seasons. In 1914, 
Gainer was sold to the Boston Red Sox. He played for Boston teams that 
won the World Series in consecutive seasons in 1915 and 1916. He had the 
third highest batting average on the Red Sox in 1915 (a .295 average trailing 
only Tris Speaker and Babe Ruth) and second highest in 1917 (a .308 batting 
average second only to Ruth). He had the game-winning hit in the 14th inning 
of Game 2 of the 1916 World Series. He spent the 1918 season in the United 
States Navy during World War I and compiled a .251 batting average in two 
major league seasons following his discharge. In 10 major league seasons, 
Gainer appeared in 548 games, 444 of them at first base, and compiled a 
.272 batting average. Gainer was born in Montrose, West Virginia, in 1886.[1] 
As a young man, he worked as a carpenter in Elkins, West Virginia, and 
played baseball as a shortstop in Elkins.[2] He began playing professional 
baseball for $80 a month with the Grafton, West Virginia, team in the newly-formed 
Pennsylvania–West Virginia League.[2] His fielding was not adequate at 
the shortstop position, and he was moved to first base.[2] He drew attention, 
however, for his batting, compiling a .317 batting average in 74 games 
for the Grafton team.[2][3] In early August 1909, Gainer was purchased 
from Grafton by the Detroit Tigers.[4] He made his major league debut with 
the Detroit Tigers on October 2, 1909. He appeared in two games for the 
1909 Tigers and had two hits and two strikeouts in five at bats.[1] In 
1910, Gainer was farmed out to the Fort Wayne Billikens in the Central 
League.[5] The deal required Fort Wayne to pay $500 for Gainer and allowed 
Detroit to buy him back at the end of the season for the same sum.[6] He 
appeared in 136 games for Fort Wayne and compiled a .311 batting average 
in 489 at bats. [3] On September 26, 1910, the Tigers exercised their option 
to recall Gainer, though he did not appear in any games with Detroit during 
the 1910 season.[5][6] In 1911, Gainer appeared in 70 games for the Tigers, 
69 of them as a first baseman, and compiled a .302 batting average in 248 
at bats.[1] Early in the season, one press report noted that "his fielding 
is making him the sensation of the American League."[7] The 1911 Tigers 
opened the season with a phenomenal 21–2 record, and manager Hughie Jennings 
in May 1911 credited Gainer with significantly improving the club at first 
base. Jennings noted: "This boy is an ideal player. . . . He abides by 
every rule of nature. He will always be in condition to play his best. 
There is something else about Gainer that you must appreciate. He does 
not think no one can tell him a thing. He is anxious to get all the pointers 
he can and he pays attention to advice and does his best to follow it. 
Not alone does he hit, but he hits in pinches and his hits are the kind 
that win ball games."[8] Another account credited Gainer with "brilliant" 
play at first base and noted that he was becoming "invaluable" to the Tigers.[9] 
However, on May 20, 1911, Gainer was lost to the Tigers when he was struck 
by a pitch thrown by Jack Coombs and sustained a broken right wrist.[10] 
In late July, Gainer was cleared to play in an emergency situation,[11] 
but he was sidelined again in August 1911 when it was determined that a 
callous had formed between the bones in his wrist.[12] In September 1911, 
it was reported that Gainer would probably undergo surgery and that "his 
injury was so bad that his arm may never get back into right condition 
again."[13] Detroit club owner Frank Navin explained the collapse of the 
1911 Tigers as follows: "It was the loss of Gainer. He was the cog that 
we had needed to fix the infield right for two years. He gave the infield 
the confidence that inspired sharp and fast fielding, and made the pitching 
job comparatively easy. The minute he was put out with a broken arm that 
confidence was lost, and the team began to slip."[14] During the off-season 
between the 1911 and 1912 seasons, Gainer saw the famed trainer "Bonesetter" 
Reese who concluded that Gainer was making fine progress and would fully 
recover.[15] However, the problems with his wrist worsened as the season 
progressed. In March 1912, Gainer reported to spring training with his 
wrist still slightly stiff.[16] He compounded his physical problems with 
an ankle injury on May 4, 1912.[17] In June 1912, he was reported to be 
planning to have his wrist re-broken by a doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital,[18] 
and in July 1912 he was diagnosed with a tumor on his broken wrist.[19] 
He appeared in only 52 games in 1912 and struggled at bat, hitting .240 
in 52 games.[1] In January 1913, Gainer reported that his wrist was finally 
healed.[20] He appeared in 105 games, 98 as the Tigers' starting first 
baseman, though he was benched for a time in May 1913 after concerns were 
raised that he had "lost his nerve and his batting eye at the same time."[21] 
He compiled a .267 batting average in 363 at bats.[1] In October 1913, 
the Tigers had a promising young first baseman in Wally Pipp, and one newspaper 
reported that Gainer was "about through as a major league player."[22] 
In December 1913, Gainer wrote from his home in Elkins, West Virginia, 
that he may retire from baseball altogether and go into business.[23] He 
indicated that he no longer enjoyed baseball and that he had purchased 
a bowling alley in Elkins and was making money at that venture.[24] He 
received a $20,000 offer to play in the Federal League and used that offer 
to make an ultimatum to the Red Sox. In early February, he signed a three-year 
contract with Boston that made him one of the highest paid players in baseball.[2][25] 
On April 8, 1914, the Boston Red Sox made a cash offer to purchase Gainer, 
but Detroit manager Hughie Jennings said he would wait until the season 
was underway before deciding on the offer.[26] Gainer stated that he did 
not want to leave Detroit, but would prefer to be a starter in Boston rather 
than sit on the bench in Detroit.[27] Jennings wanted to wait to see if 
George Burns would pan out as a starting first baseman before dealing Gainer.[27] 
Accordingly, Gainer sat on the bench for the first month of the season, 
without a plate appearance, while Burns established himself.[28] Finally, 
on May 24, 1914, the Tigers sold Gainer to the Red Sox in a cash transaction.[28] 
He played five seasons in Boston from 1914 to 1917 and 1919.[1] In 1914, 
his first year with Boston, Gainer continued to have problems with his 
arm and again visited Bonesetter Reese in June 1914.[29] He also continued 
to struggle as a batter, and the Red Sox asked compiling a .238 batting 
average.[1] In July 1920, the Red Sox acquired Dick Hoblitzel who became 
the club's starting first baseman, and asked waivers on Gainer.[30] Gainer 
remained with the Red Sox but started only 10 games at first base.[1][31] 
In August 1914, the Red Sox tried switching Gainer to second base,[32] 
and he started 10 games at that position.[1] In December 1914, the Red 
Sox denied rumors that they intended to trade Gainer; owner Joseph Lannin 
said at the time that he firmly believed Gainer had recovered his health 
and would be a big asset in 1915.[33] In 1915, Red Sox manager Bill Carrigan 
chose to platoon Gainer and Hoblitzel at first base with Gainer starting 
43 games and Hoblitzel 112 at the position. It was a great success, as 
the two had a combined OPS+ of 131, helping the Red Sox win 101 games and 
the pennant.[34] In all, Gainer appeared in 82 games, six as an outfielder, 
and hit .295 with eight triples and 29 RBIs for the 1915 Red Sox team that 
won the World Series. Gainer had the third highest batting average for 
the Red Sox — trailing only Tris Speaker and Babe Ruth.[35] He appeared 
in Game 5 in the 1915 World Series, got a base hit off Eppa Rixey in the 
eighth inning, and scored on a Duffy Lewis home run that tied the score, 
with the Red Sox then winning the game on a Harry Hooper home run in the 
ninth inning.[36] In November 1915, Gainer was honored with a banquet in 
his hometown of Elkins, West Virginia.[37] In April 1916, rumors spread 
that Gainer, who had not yet reported, was quitting baseball to take a 
job with a railroad.[38][39] In late April 1916, he wired the team that 
he would report on May 5 or 6 and be ready to play.[40] When Gainer did 
report, he again played behind Hoblitzel at first base, with Hoblitzel 
starting 113 games at the position and Gainer 39. He compiled a .254 batting 
average during the regular season in 159 at bats.[1] In the 14th inning 
of Game 2 of the 1916 World Series, he had a pinch-hit single to drive 
in the winning run to end the longest game in World Series history, and 
win the game for pitcher Babe Ruth.[41] In the 1915 and 1916 World Series, 
Gainer hit a combined .500, getting two hits in four at-bats.[1] In 1917, 
Gainer remained a backup to Hoblitzel at first base, starting only 44 games. 
However, his .308 batting average was the second highest on the Red Sox, 
trailing only Babe Ruth.[42] Gainer and Ruth were also the only Red Sox 
players with a slugging percentage above .400.[43] In November 1917, Shorten 
enlisted the United States Navy as a first class yeoman.[44] He was assigned 
to the Boston Navy Yard along with teammates Jack Barry and Chick Shorten.[45][46] 
During the summer of 1918, he played for an Atlantic Fleet baseball team 
that included Rabbit Maranville, Whitey Witt, and Paddy Driscoll.[47] On 
March 4, 1919, after being discharged from the Navy, Gainer signed a contract 
to return to the Red Sox; Dick Hoblitzel was released by the Red Sox at 
the same time.[48] Gainer appeared in 47 games for the Red Sox in 1919, 
including 15 as a starter at first base and 14 in left field. His batting 
average dropped to .237.[1] On December 24, 1919, the Red Sox sold Gainer 
to the Milwaukee Brewers in the American Association.[49] He compiled a 
.386 batting average and .583 slugging percentage in 37 games and 127 at 
bats during the 1920 season.[3] In 1921, he became a starting outfielder 
for the Brewers, appearing in 134 games at the position and compiling a 
.340 batting average in 529 at bats.[3] Gainer was sold on December 10, 
1921, by Milwaukee to the St. Louis Cardinals.[50] During the 1922 season, 
Gainer appeared in only 43 games, 21 as a starting first baseman and five 
as a starting outfielder, and compiled a .268 batting average in 97 at 
bats.[1] On September 30, 1922, Gainer hit a three-run home run in his 
final major league at bat.[1][51] He was released unconditionlly by the 
Cardinals on January 24, 1924.[52] Gainer continued to play in the minor 
leagues. From 1924 to 1926, he played in the Texas League for the Houston 
Buffaloes. He compiled batting averages of .350 and .328 in 1924 and 1925.[3] 
In May 1926, he was traded by the Houston club to the Syracuse Stars as 
part of a multi-player deal.[53] He spent the 1926 and 1927 seasons with 
Syracuse and compiled a .329 average in 1927.[3] He spent the 1928 season 
as a coach and pinch-hitter for the Rochester Red Wings of the International 
League, compiling a .328 average in 61 at bats. He was released by Rochester 
on November 20, 1928.[54] In March 1929, he signed as a coach with the 
Baltimore Orioles.[55] He was also used as a pinch-hitter by the Orioles, 
appearing in 33 games at age 42 and compiling a .344 batting average in 
33 at bats.[3] In January 1930, Gainer was hired as the manager of the 
Fairmont Black Diamonds in the Middle Atlantic League.[56] He resigned 
as manager on July 5, 1930.[57] According to one account, he was "well 
liked by fans, but poor health and a seven-game losing streak discouraged 
him to such an extent that he gave up the reins."[58] After retiring from 
baseball, Gainer worked as a deputy U. S. Marshall in West Virginia.[59] 
He was married in August 1937 to Pauline Edwards, the secretary to the 
judge in the courtroom where Gainer was assigned.[60] They had a daughter, 
Barbara Ellen "Bobbi" Gainer.[61] He died suddenly in January 1947 at age 
60 after being stricken at his home in Elkins, West Virginia.[59] The cause 
of death was reported by The Sporting News to have been a "sudden heart
