Daniel Allen Wilson (born March 25, 1969), is an American former professional 
baseball player.[1] He played in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati 
Reds and the Seattle Mariners, primarily as a catcher.[1] He is regarded 
as one of the best defensive catchers in major-league history, setting 
an American League record for catchers with a .995 career fielding percentage.[2] 
Wilson excelled as a baseball player from a very early age. He led his 
hometown Barrington, Illinois team to a 3rd-place finish in the 1981 Little 
League World Series. At Barrington High School (Lake County, Illinois) 
he starred as a pitcher and catcher. Wilson was first drafted in the 26th 
round of the 1987 Major League Baseball Draft by the New York Mets.[3] 
He did not sign with the Mets, electing to instead go to the University 
of Minnesota. He re-entered the draft in 1990; he was selected in the first 
round, seventh overall, by the Cincinnati Reds.[4] He signed in time to 
play 32 games with the Charleston Wheelers of the South Atlantic League.[5] 
He returned to Charleston at the start of the 1991 season, batting .315 
in 52 games before earning a promotion to Class AA Chattanooga.[5] He started 
the 1992 season with Nashville in the Triple-A American Association, and 
he batted .251 in 106 games there before earning a September callup to 
the major leagues at age 23.[5] He returned to the minor leagues the following 
year, going to the Indianapolis Indians since the Reds had changed their 
AAA affiliation after the 1992 season, and he played 51 games for the Indians 
as well as 36 games in the majors for the Reds.[1] After the 1993 season, 
the Reds traded Wilson to the Seattle Mariners for second baseman Bret 
Boone.[6] He made the Mariners' roster out of spring training and became 
an established major-league player, replacing Dave Valle as the Mariners 
catcher.[7] In his first full season in the majors, he struggled at the 
plate, batting .216, but he showed signs of his defensive ability with 
a .986 fielding percentage.[1] That turned out to be the lowest fielding 
percentage he would have in the years he spent as the Mariners' primary 
catcher.[1] The 1995 season went better for him; he played 119 games, batting 
.278 and raising his fielding percentage to .995, as the Mariners won the 
American League Western Division pennant.[1][8] In 1996, Wilson set career 
highs with 146 games played, 18 home runs, 83 runs batted in, and a .774 
OPS.[1] In addition, he made his only All-Star appearance.[1] The 1996 
season was also his first working with starting pitcher Jamie Moyer; Randy 
Johnson was another pitcher he spent several seasons catching with the 
Mariners. In 1998 Wilson hit an inside-the-park-grand slam, an unusual 
feat for any ballplayer, and especially for a catcher.[9] Wilson remained 
a dependable battery mate for Mariners pitchers over the next several seasons. 
In the 2000 season, Wilson's numbers declined to a .235 batting average 
and .990 fielding percentage;[1] he was also limited to 90 games because 
of injuries. However, in 2001, he regained his form, playing 123 games 
(122 at catcher) and posting a .265 batting average and a .999 fielding 
percentage (one error in 744 total chances).[1] Although it was becoming 
late in his career, he posted a .295 batting average in 115 games for the 
Mariners in 2002, and a .998 fielding percentage over 96 games in 2003.[1] 
In what ended up being his last full healthy season in the majors, he batted 
.251 with 33 RBI in 2004.[1] Wilson lost his starting job at the beginning 
of the 2005 season to Miguel Olivo. On May 4, he suffered a torn anterior 
cruciate ligament in his right knee during a game against the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim. Wilson had intended the 2005 season to be his last as 
a player, and he announced his retirement, effective at the end of the 
2005 season, on September 12.[2] Although a torn ACL commonly keeps athletes 
sidelined for most of a season, Wilson spent most of the rest of the season 
rehabilitating his knee and was activated from the disabled list on September 
30. He came back for one final inning on September 30 against the Oakland 
Athletics; he had not recovered enough to swing a bat, but he was able 
to crouch and throw. The Mariners' starting pitcher in that game was Jamie 
Moyer, with whom Wilson had formed a battery for 190 previous starts dating 
back to 1996. Moyer pitched to five batters in the inning, which ended 
when Bobby Kielty flied out to center field, and the Athletics scored no 
runs. Moyer went on to pitch seven more innings, and the Mariners defeated 
the Athletics, 4–1.[10] In a fourteen-year major league career, Wilson 
played in 1,299 games, accumulating 1,097 hits in 4,186 at bats for a .262 
career batting average along with 88 home runs and 519 runs batted in.[1] 
He ended his career with a .995 fielding percentage; the highest for a 
catcher in American League history, and the sixth highest in major league 
history.[2][11] Wilson led American League catchers twice in fielding percentage, 
twice in putouts, twice in baserunners caught stealing and twice in range 
factor.[1] Wilson set an American League record for catchers with 1,051 
putouts in 1997, the fourth highest season total for a catcher in major 
league history.[12] His 1,128 total chances in 1997 were the sixth highest 
season total for a catcher in major league history.[13] In 2001, Wilson 
committed only one error in 122 games, for a .9987 fielding percentage, 
the fourth highest season average in major league history.[14] He played 
in more games as a catcher than any other player in Mariners history (1,281).[15] 
On January 17, 2012, Wilson was named to the Mariners Hall of Fame.[16] 
Since 2011, he has appeared as one of the color commentators for Seattle 
Mariners baseball games on Root Sports. Notably, along with Dave Sims, 
Wilson called the game on August 15, 2012 when Félix Hernández pitched 
the first perfect game in Mariners' franchise history. He was also broadcasting 
on Root Sports on June 8, 2012 when six Mariners' pitchers combined for 
a no-hitter. On November 3, 2013, the Mariners announced that Wilson will
