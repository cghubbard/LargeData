The Cleveland Indians are a professional baseball team based in Cleveland, 
Ohio. They are in the Central Division of Major League Baseball's American 
League. Since 1994, they have played in Progressive Field. The Cleveland 
team originated in 1900 as the Lake Shores, when the American League (AL) 
was officially a minor league. One of the AL's eight charter franchises, 
the major league incarnation of the club was founded in Cleveland in 1901. 
The Grand Rapids Rustlers was founded in Michigan in 1894 and were in the 
Western League. In 1900 the team moved to Cleveland and was named The Cleveland 
Lake Shores. Around the same time Ban Johnson changed the name of his minor 
league Western League to the American League. In 1900 the American League 
was still considered a minor league. In 1901 Cleveland renamed itself the 
"Bluebirds" when the American League broke with the National Agreement 
and declared itself a competing Major League. The Cleveland franchise was 
among its eight charter members. The new team was owned by coal magnate 
Charles Somers and tailor Jack Kilfoyl. Somers, a wealthy industrialist 
and also co-owner of the Boston Americans, lent money to other team owners, 
including Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, to keep them and the new 
league afloat. Players didn't think the name "Bluebirds" was suitable for 
a baseball team.[1] Writers frequently shortened it to "Blues" due to the 
players' all-blue uniforms,[2] but the players didn't like this name either. 
The players themselves tried to change the name to "Broncos" in 1902, but 
it never really caught on.[1] The Bluebirds suffered from financial problems 
in their first two seasons. This led Somers to seriously consider moving 
to either Pittsburgh or Cincinnati. Relief came in 1902 as a result of 
the conflict between the National and American Leagues. In 1901, Napoleon 
"Nap" Lajoie, the Philadelphia Phillies' star second baseman, jumped to 
the A's after his contract was capped at $2,400 per year—one of the highest-profile 
players to jump to the upstart AL. The Phillies subsequently filed an injunction 
to force Lajoie's return, which was granted by the Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court. The injunction appeared to doom any hopes of an early settlement 
between the warring leagues. However, a lawyer discovered that the injunction 
was only enforceable in the state of Pennsylvania.[1] Mack, partly to thank 
Somers for his past financial support, agreed to trade Lajoie to the then-moribund 
Blues, who offered $25,000 salary over three years.[3] Due to the injunction, 
however, Lajoie had to sit out any games played against the A's in Philadelphia.[4] 
Lajoie arrived in Cleveland on June 4 and was an immediate hit, drawing 
10,000 fans to League Park. Soon afterward, he was named team captain, 
and the team was renamed the "Naps" after a newspaper conducted a write-in 
contest.[1] Lajoie was named manager in 1905, and the team's fortunes improved 
somewhat. They finished half a game short of the pennant in 1908.[5] However, 
the success did not last and Lajoie resigned during the 1909 season as 
manager but remained on as a player.[6] After that, the team began to unravel, 
leading Kilfoyl to sell his share of the team to Somers. Cy Young, who 
returned to Cleveland in 1909, was ineffective for most of his three remaining 
years[7] and Addie Joss died from tubercular meningitis prior to the 1910 
season.[8] Despite a strong lineup anchored by the potent Lajoie and Shoeless 
Joe Jackson, poor pitching kept the team below third place for most of 
the next decade. One reporter referred to the team as the Napkins, "because 
they fold up so easily". The team hit bottom in 1914 and 1915, finishing 
in the cellar both years.[9][10] 1915 brought significant changes to the 
team. Lajoie, nearly 40 years old was no longer a top hitter in the league, 
batting only .258 in 1914. With Lajoie engaged in a feud with manager Joe 
Birmingham, the team sold Lajoie back to the A's.[11] With Lajoie gone, 
the club needed a new name. Somers asked the local baseball writers to 
come up with a new name, and based on their input, the team was renamed 
the Cleveland Indians.[12] It is claimed that the nickname "Indians" references 
Cleveland Spiders baseball club during the time when Louis Sockalexis, 
a Native American, had played in Cleveland (1897–99),[13] however this 
is contested by sportswriter Joe Posnanski who argues "Why exactly would 
people in Cleveland — this in a time when Native Americans were generally 
viewed as subhuman in America — name their team after a relatively minor 
and certainly troubled outfielder?" Sockalexis played only 96 games over 
three seasons, compiling just 367 at bats in his career. Sockalexis also 
"had to deal with horrendous racism, terrible taunts, whoops from the crowd, 
and so on," according to Posnanski. According to history professor Jonathan 
Zimmerman, the franchise was named the Indians by local baseball writers 
not to honor Sockalexis, but as a reference to the "fun" that he would 
inspire in crowds and the fact that journalists jokingly referred to the 
club as the "Cleveland Indians," even though it was officially named the 
Spiders.[14] "In place of the Naps, we'll have the Indians, on the warpath 
all the time, and eager for scalps to dangle at their belts," wrote an 
article in the Cleveland Leader of January 17, 1915. None of the contemporary 
reports from daily Cleveland newspapers detailing the name change mentions 
Sockalexis, while each references negative stereotypes of indigenous people 
in their reports of the name change.[15] At the same time as the team was 
renamed, Somers' business ventures began to fail, leaving him deeply in 
debt. With the Indians playing poorly, attendance and revenue suffered.[16] 
Somers decided to trade Jackson midway through the 1915 season for two 
players and $31,500, one of the largest sums paid for a player at the time.[17] 
By 1916, Somers was at the end of his tether, and sold the team to a syndicate 
headed by Chicago railroad contractor James C. "Jack" Dunn.[16] Manager 
Lee Fohl, who had taken over in early 1915, acquired two minor league pitchers, 
Stan Coveleski and Jim Bagby and traded for center fielder Tris Speaker, 
who was engaged in a salary dispute with the Red Sox.[18] All three would 
ultimately become key players in bringing a championship to Cleveland. 
Speaker took over the reins as player-manager in 1919, and would lead the 
team to a championship in 1920. On August 16, the Indians were playing 
the Yankees at the Polo Grounds in New York. Shortstop Ray Chapman, who 
often crowded the plate, was batting against Carl Mays, who had an unusual 
underhand delivery. It was also late in the afternoon and the infield would 
have been in shadow with the center field area (the batters' background) 
bathed in sunlight. As well, at the time, "part of every pitcher's job 
was to dirty up a new ball the moment it was thrown onto the field. By 
turns, they smeared it with dirt, licorice, tobacco juice; it was deliberately 
scuffed, sandpapered, scarred, cut, even spiked. The result was a misshapen, 
earth-colored ball that traveled through the air erratically, tended to 
soften in the later innings, and as it came over the plate, was very hard 
to see."[19] In any case, Chapman did not move reflexively when Mays' pitch 
came his way. The pitch hit Chapman in the head, fracturing his skull. 
Chapman died the next day, becoming the only player to sustain a fatal 
injury from a pitched ball.[20] The Indians, who at the time were locked 
in a tight three-way pennant race with the Yankees and White Sox,[21] were 
not slowed down by the death of their teammate. Rookie Joe Sewell hit .329 
after replacing Chapman in the lineup.[22] In September 1920, the Black 
Sox Scandal came to a boil. With just a few games left in the season, and 
Cleveland and Chicago neck-and-neck for first place at 94–54 and 95–56 
respectively,[23][24] the Chicago owner suspended eight players. The White 
Sox lost 2 of 3 in their final series, while Cleveland won 4 and lost 2 
in their final two series. Cleveland finished 2 games ahead of Chicago 
and 3 games ahead of the Yankees to win its first pennant, led by Speaker's 
.388 hitting, Jim Bagby's 30 victories, and solid performances from Steve 
O'Neill and Stan Coveleski. Cleveland went on to defeat the Brooklyn Robins 
5–2 in the World Series for their first title, winning four games in a 
row after the Robins took a 2–1 Series lead. The Series included three 
memorable "firsts", all of them in Game 5 at Cleveland, and all by the 
home team. In the first inning, right fielder Elmer Smith hit the first 
Series grand slam. In the fourth inning, Jim Bagby hit the first Series 
home run by a pitcher. And in the top of the fifth inning, second baseman 
Bill Wambsganss executed the first (and only, so far) unassisted triple 
play in World Series history, in fact the only Series triple play of any 
kind. The team would not reach the heights of 1920 again for 28 years. 
Speaker and Coveleski were aging and the Yankees were rising with a new 
weapon: Babe Ruth and the home run. They managed two second-place finishes 
but spent much of the decade in the cellar. In 1927 Dunn's widow, Mrs. 
George Pross (Dunn had died in 1922), sold the team to a syndicate headed 
by Alva Bradley. The Indians were a middling team by the 1930s, finishing 
third or fourth most years. 1936 brought Cleveland a 17-year-old pitcher 
Bob Feller, who came from Iowa with a powerful fastball. That season, Feller 
set a record with 17 strikeouts in a single game and went on to lead the 
league in strikeouts from 1938–1941. On August 20, 1938, Indians catchers 
Hank Helf and Frank Pytlak set the "all-time altitude mark" by catching 
baseballs dropped from the 708-foot Terminal Tower.[25] By 1940, Feller, 
along with Ken Keltner, Mel Harder and Lou Boudreau led the Indians to 
within one game of the pennant. However, the team was wracked with dissension, 
with some players (including Feller and Harder) going so far as to request 
that Bradley fire manager Ossie Vitt.[citation needed] Reporters lampooned 
them as the Cleveland Crybabies.[26][better source needed] Feller, who 
had pitched a no-hitter to open the season and won 27 games, lost the final 
game of the season to unknown pitcher Floyd Giebell of the Detroit Tigers. 
The Tigers won the pennant and Giebell never won another major league game.[27] 
Cleveland entered 1941 with a young team and a new manager; Roger Peckinpaugh 
had replaced the despised Vitt; but the team regressed, finishing in fourth. 
Cleveland would soon be depleted of two stars. Hal Trosky retired in 1941 
due to migraine headaches[28] and Bob Feller enlisted in the U.S. Navy 
two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Starting third baseman Ken Keltner 
and outfielder Ray Mack were both drafted in 1945 taking two more starters 
out of the lineup.[29] In 1946 Bill Veeck formed an investment group that 
purchased the Cleveland Indians from Bradley's group for a reported $1.6 
million.[30] Among the investors was Bob Hope, who had grown up in Cleveland, 
and former Tigers slugger, Hank Greenberg.[31] A former owner of a minor 
league franchise in Milwaukee, Veeck brought to Cleveland a gift for promotion. 
At one point, Veeck hired rubber-faced[32] Max Patkin, the "Clown Prince 
of Baseball" as a coach. Patkin's appearance in the coaching box was the 
sort of promotional stunt that delighted fans but infuriated the American 
League front office. Recognizing that he had acquired a solid team, Veeck 
soon abandoned the aging, small and lightless League Park to take up full-time 
residence in massive Cleveland Municipal Stadium.[33] Prior to 1947 the 
Indians played most of their games at League Park, and occasionally played 
weekend games at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. League Park was demolished 
in 1951, although a portion of the original ticket booth remains.[34] Making 
the most of the cavernous stadium, Veeck had a portable center field fence 
installed, which he could move in or out depending on how the distance 
favored the Indians against their opponents in a given series. The fence 
moved as much as 15 feet (5 m) between series opponents. Following the 
1947 season, the American League countered with a rule change that fixed 
the distance of an outfield wall for the duration of a season. The massive 
stadium did, however, permit the Indians to set the then record for the 
largest crowd to see a Major League baseball game. On October 10, 1948, 
Game 5 of the World Series against the Boston Braves drew over 84,000. 
The record stood until the Los Angeles Dodgers drew a crowd in excess of 
92,500 to watch Game 5 of the 1959 World Series at the Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum against the Chicago White Sox. Under Veeck's leadership, one of 
Cleveland's most significant achievements was breaking the color barrier 
in the American League by signing Larry Doby, formerly a player for the 
Negro League's Newark Eagles in 1947, eleven weeks after Jackie Robinson 
signed with the Dodgers.[33] Similar to Robinson, Doby battled racism on 
and off the field but posted a .301 batting average in 1948, his first 
full season. A power-hitting center fielder, Doby led the American League 
twice in homers. In 1948, needing pitching for the stretch run of the pennant 
race, Veeck turned to the Negro League again and signed pitching great 
Satchel Paige amid much controversy.[33] Barred from Major League Baseball 
during his prime, Veeck's signing of the aging star in 1948 was viewed 
by many as another publicity stunt. At an official age of 42, Paige became 
the oldest rookie in Major League baseball history, and the first black 
pitcher. Paige ended the year with a 6–1 record with a 2.48 ERA, 45 strikeouts 
and two shutouts.[35] In 1948, veterans Boudreau, Keltner, and Joe Gordon 
had career offensive seasons, while newcomers Larry Doby and Gene Bearden 
also had standout seasons. The team went down to the wire with the Boston 
Red Sox, winning a one-game playoff, the first in American League history, 
to go to the World Series. In the series, the Indians defeated the Boston 
Braves four games to two for their first championship in 28 years. Boudreau 
won the American League MVP Award. The Indians would appear in a film the 
following year titled The Kid From Cleveland, in which Veeck had an interest.[33] 
The film portrayed the team helping out a "troubled teenaged fan"[36] and 
featured many members of the Indians organization. However, filming during 
the season cost the players valuable rest days leading to fatigue towards 
the end of the season.[33] That season, Cleveland again contended before 
falling to third place. On September 23, 1949, Bill Veeck and the Indians 
buried their 1948 pennant in center field the day after they were mathematically 
eliminated from the pennant race.[33] Later in 1949, Veeck's first wife 
(who had a half-stake in Veeck's share of the team) divorced him. With 
most of his money tied up in the Indians, Veeck was forced to sell the 
team[37] to a syndicate headed by insurance magnate Ellis Ryan. Ryan was 
forced out in 1953 in favor of Myron Wilson, who in turn gave way to William 
Daley in 1956. Despite this turnover in the ownership, a powerhouse team 
composed of Feller, Doby, Minnie Miñoso, Luke Easter, Bobby Ávila, Al Rosen, 
Early Wynn, Bob Lemon, and Mike Garcia continued to contend through the 
early 1950s. However, Cleveland only won a single pennant in the decade, 
finishing second to the New York Yankees five times. The winningest season 
in franchise history came in 1954, when the Indians finished the season 
with a record of 111–43 (.721). That mark set an American League record 
for wins which stood for 44 years until the Yankees won 114 games in 1998 
(a 162-game regular season). The Indians 1954 winning percentage of .721 
is still an American League record. The Indians returned to the World Series 
to face the New York Giants. The team could not bring home the title, however, 
ultimately being upset by the Giants in a sweep. The series was notable 
for Willie Mays' over-the-shoulder catch off the bat of Vic Wertz in Game 
1. From 1960 to 1993, the Indians managed one third-place finish (in 1968) 
and six fourth-place finishes (in 1960, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1990, and 1992) 
but spent the rest of the time at or near the bottom of the standings. 
The Indians hired general manager Frank Lane, known as "Trader" Lane, away 
from the St. Louis Cardinals in 1957. Over the years, Lane had gained a 
reputation as a GM who loved to make deals. With the White Sox, Lane had 
made over 100 trades involving over 400 players in seven years.[38] In 
a short stint in St. Louis, he traded away Red Schoendienst and Harvey 
Haddix.[38] Lane summed up his philosophy when he said that the only deals 
he regretted were the ones that he didn't make.[39] One of Lane's early 
trades in Cleveland was to send Roger Maris to the Kansas City Athletics 
in the middle of 1958. Indians executive Hank Greenberg was not happy about 
the trade[40] and neither was Maris, who said that he could not stand Lane.[40] 
After Maris broke Babe Ruth's home run record, Lane defended himself by 
saying he still would have done the deal because Maris was unknown and 
he received good ballplayers in exchange.[40] After the Maris trade, Lane 
acquired 25-year-old Norm Cash from the White Sox for Minnie Miñoso and 
then traded him to Detroit before he ever played a game for the Indians; 
Cash went on to hit over 350 home runs for the Tigers. The Indians received 
Steve Demeter in the deal, who would have only five at-bats for Cleveland.[41] 
In 1960, Lane made the trade that would define his tenure in Cleveland 
when he dealt slugging right fielder and fan favorite[42] Rocky Colavito 
to the Detroit Tigers for Harvey Kuenn just before Opening Day in 1960. 
It was a blockbuster trade that swapped the 1959 AL home run co-champion 
(Colavito) for the AL batting champion (Kuenn). After the trade, however, 
Colavito hit over 30 home runs four times and made three All-Star teams 
for Detroit and Kansas City before returning to Cleveland in 1965. Kuenn, 
on the other hand, would play only one season for the Indians before departing 
for San Francisco in a trade for an aging Johnny Antonelli and Willie Kirkland. 
Akron Beacon Journal columnist Terry Pluto documented the decades of woe 
that followed the trade in his book The Curse of Rocky Colavito.[43] Despite 
being attached to the curse, Colavito said that he never placed a curse 
on the Indians but that the trade was prompted by a salary dispute with 
Lane.[44] Lane also engineered a unique trade of managers in mid-season 
1960, sending Joe Gordon to the Tigers in exchange for Jimmy Dykes. Lane 
left the team in 1961, but ill-advised trades continued. In 1965, the Indians 
traded pitcher Tommy John, who would go on to win 288 games in his career, 
and 1966 Rookie of the Year Tommy Agee to the White Sox to get Colavito 
back.[44] Lou Piniella, the 1969 Rookie of the Year and Luis Tiant, who 
was selected to two All-Star Games after leaving, both left. At one point, 
Cleveland even traded Harry Chiti to the New York Mets, only to receive 
him back as the player to be named later after 15 days. The 1970s were 
little better, with the Indians trading away several future stars, including 
Graig Nettles, Dennis Eckersley, Buddy Bell and 1971 Rookie of the Year 
Chris Chambliss,[45] for a number of players who made no impact.[46] Constant 
ownership changes did not help the Indians. In 1963, Daley's syndicate 
sold the team to a group headed by general manager Gabe Paul.[1] Three 
years later, Paul sold the Indians to Vernon Stouffer,[47] of the Stouffer's 
frozen-food empire. Prior to Stouffer's purchase, the team was rumored 
to be relocated due to poor attendance. Despite the potential for a financially 
strong owner, Stouffer had some non-baseball related financial setbacks 
and, consequently, the team was cash-poor. In order to solve some financial 
problems, Stouffer had made an agreement to play a minimum of 30 home games 
in New Orleans with a view to a possible move there.[48] After rejecting 
an offer from George Steinbrenner and former Indian Al Rosen, Stouffer 
sold the team in 1972 to a group led by Cleveland Cavaliers and Cleveland 
Barons owner Nick Mileti.[48] Steinbrenner went on to buy the New York 
Yankees in 1973.[49] Only five years later, Mileti's group sold the team 
for $11 million to a syndicate headed by trucking magnate Steve O'Neill 
and including former general manager and owner Gabe Paul.[50] O'Neill's 
death in 1983 led to the team going on the market once more. His son, Patrick 
O'Neill, did not find a buyer until real estate magnates Richard and David 
Jacobs purchased the team in 1986. The team was unable to move out of the 
cellar, with losing seasons between 1969 and 1975. One highlight was the 
acquisition of Gaylord Perry in 1972. The Indians traded fireballer "Sudden 
Sam" McDowell for Perry, who became the first Indian pitcher to win the 
Cy Young Award. In 1975, Cleveland broke another color barrier with the 
hiring of Frank Robinson as Major League Baseball's first African American 
manager. Robinson served as player-manager and would provide a franchise 
highlight when he hit a pinch hit home run on Opening Day. But the high-profile 
signing of Wayne Garland, a 20-game winner in Baltimore, proved to be a 
disaster after Garland suffered from shoulder problems and went 28–48 over 
five years.[51] The team failed to improve with Robinson as manager and 
he was fired in 1977. In 1977, pitcher Dennis Eckersley threw a no-hitter 
against the California Angels. The next season, he would be dealt to the 
Boston Red Sox where he won 20 games in 1978 and another 17 in 1979. The 
1970s also featured the infamous Ten Cent Beer Night at Cleveland Municipal 
Stadium. The ill-conceived promotion at a 1974 game against the Texas Rangers 
ended in a riot by fans and a forfeit by the Indians.[52] There were more 
bright spots in the 1980s. In May 1981, Len Barker threw a perfect game 
against the Toronto Blue Jays, joining Addie Joss as the only other Indian 
pitcher to do so.[53] "Super Joe" Charbonneau won the American League Rookie 
of the Year award. Unfortunately, Charboneau was out of baseball by 1983 
after falling victim to back injuries[54] and Barker, who was also hampered 
by injuries, never became a consistently dominant starting pitcher.[53] 
Eventually, the Indians traded Barker to the Atlanta Braves for Brett Butler 
and Brook Jacoby,[53] who would become mainstays of the team for the remainder 
of the decade. Butler and Jacoby were joined by Joe Carter, Mel Hall, Julio 
Franco and Cory Snyder, which brought new hope to fans in the late 1980s.[55] 
After a rare winning season in 1986, Sports Illustrated, with Carter and 
Snyder pictured on the cover, boldly predicted the Indians to win the American 
League East in 1987. Instead, the team went on to lose 101 games and finish 
with the worst record in baseball, a fate attributed to the Sports Illustrated 
cover jinx.[56] Cleveland's struggles over the 30-year span were highlighted 
in the 1989 film Major League, which comically depicted a hapless Cleveland 
ball club going from worst to first by the end of the film. Throughout 
the 1980s, Indians owners had pushed for a new stadium. Cleveland Stadium 
had been a symbol of the Indians' glory years in the 1940s and 1950s. However, 
during the lean years even crowds of 40,000 were swallowed up by the cavernous 
environment. The old stadium was not aging gracefully; chunks of concrete 
were falling off in sections and the old wooden pilings now petrified.[57] 
In 1984, a proposal for a $150 million domed stadium was defeated in a 
referendum 2–1.[58] Finally, in May 1990, Cuyahoga County voters passed 
an excise tax on sales of alcohol and cigarettes in the county. The tax 
proceeds would be used to finance the building of the Gateway Sports and 
Entertainment Complex which would include Jacobs Field and Gund Arena for 
the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team.[59] The team had new ownership 
and a new stadium on the way. They now needed a winning team. The team's 
fortunes started to turn in 1989, ironically with a very unpopular trade. 
The team sent power-hitting outfielder Joe Carter to the San Diego Padres 
for two unproven players, Sandy Alomar, Jr. and Carlos Baerga. Alomar made 
an immediate impact, not only being elected to the All-Star team but also 
winning Cleveland's fourth Rookie of the Year award and a Gold Glove. Baerga 
would become a three-time All-Star with consistent offensive production. 
Indians general manager John Hart made a number of moves that would finally 
bring success to the team. In 1991, he hired former Indian Mike Hargrove 
to manage and traded catcher Eddie Taubensee to the Houston Astros who, 
with a surplus of outfielders, were willing to part with Kenny Lofton. 
Lofton finished second in AL Rookie of the Year balloting with a .285 average 
and 66 stolen bases. The Indians were named "Organization of the Year" 
by Baseball America[60] in 1992, in response to the appearance of offensive 
bright spots and an improving farm system. The team suffered a tragedy 
during spring training of 1993, when a boat carrying pitchers Steve Olin, 
Tim Crews, and Bob Ojeda crashed into a pier. Olin and Crews were killed, 
and Ojeda was seriously injured. (Ojeda missed most of the season, and 
would retire the following year).[61] By the end of the 1993 season, the 
team was in transition, leaving Cleveland Stadium and fielding a talented 
nucleus of young players. Many of those players came from the Indians' 
new AAA farm team, the Charlotte Knights, who won the International League 
title that year. Indians General Manager John Hart and team owner Richard 
Jacobs managed to turn the team's fortunes around. The Indians opened Jacobs 
Field in 1994 with the aim of improving on the prior season's sixth-place 
finish. The Indians were only one game behind the division-leading Chicago 
White Sox on August 12 when a players strike wiped out the rest of the 
season. The strike also led to an absurdity: The Minnesota Twins traded 
Dave Winfield to the Cleveland Indians at the trade waiver deadline on 
August 31 for a "player to be named later." The 1994 season had been halted 
two weeks earlier (it was eventually canceled a month later on September 
14), so Winfield did not get to play for the Indians that year and no player 
was ever named in exchange. To settle the trade, Cleveland and Minnesota 
executives went to dinner, with the Indians picking up the tab. This makes 
Winfield the only player in major league history to be traded for a dinner.[62] 
Having contended for the division in the aborted 1994 season, Cleveland 
sprinted to a 100–44 record (18 games were lost to player/owner negotiations) 
in 1995 winning its first ever divisional title. Veterans Dennis Martínez, 
Orel Hershiser and Eddie Murray combined with a young core of players including 
Albert Belle, Jim Thome, Manny Ramírez and Charles Nagy to lead the league 
in team batting average as well as team ERA. After defeating the Boston 
Red Sox in the Division Series and the Seattle Mariners in the ALCS, Cleveland 
clinched a World Series berth, for the first time since 1954. The World 
Series ended in disappointment with the Indians falling in six games to 
the Atlanta Braves. The Indians repeated as AL Central champions in 1996, 
but lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the Division Series. Notably in 1996, 
tickets for every home game for the Indians sold out before opening day. 
In 1997 Cleveland started slow but finished with an 86–75 record. Taking 
their third consecutive AL Central title, the Indians defeated the heavily 
favored New York Yankees in the Division Series, 3–2. After defeating the 
Baltimore Orioles in the ALCS, Cleveland went on to face the Florida Marlins 
in the World Series which featured the coldest game in World Series history. 
With the series tied after game six, the Indians went into the ninth inning 
of Game 7 with a 2–1 lead, but closer José Mesa allowed the Marlins to 
tie the game. In the eleventh inning, Édgar Rentería drove in the winning 
run giving the Marlins their first championship. Cleveland became the first 
team to lose the World Series after carrying the lead into the bottom of 
the ninth inning of the seventh game. In his 2002 autobiography, Indians 
shortstop Omar Vizquel blamed José Mesa for the loss, which led to a feud 
between the players.[63] In 1998, the Indians made the playoffs for the 
fourth straight year. After defeating the wild-card Boston Red Sox three 
games to one in the first round of the playoffs, Cleveland lost the 1998 
ALCS in six games to the New York Yankees, who had come into the playoffs 
with 114 wins in the regular season.[64] For the 1999 season, Cleveland 
added relief pitcher Ricardo Rincón and Roberto Alomar, brother of catcher 
Sandy Alomar,[65] and won the Central Division title for its fifth consecutive 
playoff appearance. The team scored 1,009 runs, becoming the first (and 
to date only) team since the 1950 Boston Red Sox to score more than 1,000 
runs in a season. This time, Cleveland did not make it past the first round, 
losing the Division Series to the Red Sox, despite taking a two-games-to-none 
lead in the series. In game three, Indians starter Dave Burba went down 
with an injury in the 4th inning.[66] Four pitchers, including presumed 
game four starter Jaret Wright, surrendered nine runs in relief. Without 
a long reliever or emergency starter on the playoff roster, Hargrove started 
both Bartolo Colón and Charles Nagy in games four and five on only three 
days rest.[66] The Indians lost game four 23–7 and game five 12–8.[67] 
Four days later, Hargrove was dismissed as manager.[68] In 2000, the Indians 
had a 44–42 start, but caught fire after the All Star break and went 46–30 
the rest of the way to finish 90–72. The team had one of the league's best 
offenses that year and a defense that yielded three gold gloves. However, 
they ended up five games behind the Chicago White Sox in the Central division 
and missed the wild card by one game to the Seattle Mariners. Mid-season 
trades brought Bob Wickman and Jake Westbrook to Cleveland, and free agent 
Manny Ramírez departed for Boston after the season. The Indians set a Major 
League record for most pitchers used in a single season. Colon, Burba, 
and Chuck Finley posted strong seasons, and the bullpen was solid. But 
with Jaret Wright and Charles Nagy spending months on the disabled list, 
the team could not solidify the final two spots in the rotation. Other 
starting pitchers that season combined for a total of 346⅔ innings and 
265 earned runs for an ERA of 6.88. In 2000, Larry Dolan bought the Indians 
for $320 million from Richard Jacobs, who, along with his late brother 
David, had paid $45 million for the club in 1986. The sale set a record 
at the time for the sale of a baseball franchise.[69] 2001 saw a return 
to the playoffs. After the departures of Manny Ramírez and Sandy Alomar, 
Jr., the Indians signed Ellis Burks and former MVP Juan González, who helped 
the Indians win the Central division with a 91–71 record. On June 2 Jacob 
Cruz was traded for Jody Gerut and Josh Bard. One of the highlights came 
on August 5, 2001, when the Indians completed the biggest comeback in MLB 
History. Cleveland rallied to close a 14–2 deficit in the sixth inning 
to defeat the Seattle Mariners 15–14 in 11 innings. The Mariners, who won 
a record 116 games that season, had a strong bullpen, and Indians manager 
Charlie Manuel had already pulled many of his starters with the game seemingly 
out of reach. Seattle and Cleveland met in the first round of the playoffs, 
with the Indians taking a two-games-to-one lead. However, with Freddy Garcia, 
Jamie Moyer and a strong bullpen, the Mariners won Games 4 and 5 to deny 
the Indians their first playoff series victory since 1998. In the 2001 
offseason, GM John Hart resigned and his assistant Mark Shapiro took the 
reins. Shapiro moved to rebuild by dealing aging veterans for younger talent. 
He traded Roberto Alomar to the New York Mets for a package that included 
outfielder Matt Lawton and prospects Alex Escobar and Billy Traber. When 
the team fell out of contention in mid-2002, Shapiro fired manager Charlie 
Manuel and traded pitching ace Bartolo Colón for prospects Brandon Phillips, 
Cliff Lee, and Grady Sizemore; acquired Travis Hafner from the Rangers 
for Ryan Drese and Einar Díaz; and picked up Coco Crisp from the St. Louis 
Cardinals for aging starter Chuck Finley. Jim Thome left after the season, 
going to the Phillies for a larger contract. Young Indians teams finished 
far out of contention in 2002 and 2003 under new manager Eric Wedge. They 
posted strong offensive numbers in 2004, but continued to struggle with 
a bullpen that blew more than 20 saves. A highlight of the season was a 
22–0 victory over the New York Yankees on August 31, one of the worst defeats 
suffered by the Yankees in team history.[70] In early 2005, the offense 
got off to a poor start. After a brief July slump, the Indians caught fire 
in August, and cut a 15.5 game deficit in the Central Division down to 
1.5 games. However, the season came to an end as the Indians went on to 
lose six of their last seven games, five of them by one run, missing the 
playoffs by only two games. Shapiro was named Executive of the Year in 
2005.[71]The next season, the club made several roster changes, while retaining 
its nucleus of young players. The off-season was highlighted by the acquisition 
of top prospect Andy Marte from the Boston Red Sox. The Indians had a solid 
offensive season, led by career years from Travis Hafner and Grady Sizemore. 
Hafner, despite missing the last month of the season, tied the single season 
grand slam record of six, which was set in 1987 by Don Mattingly.[72] Despite 
the solid offensive performance, the bullpen struggled with 23 blown saves 
(a Major League worst), and the Indians finished a disappointing fourth.[73] 
In 2007, Shapiro signed veteran help for the bullpen and outfield in the 
offseason. Veterans Aaron Fultz, and Joe Borowski joined Rafael Betancourt 
in the Indians bullpen.[74] Shapiro also signed right fielder Trot Nixon 
and left fielder David Dellucci to short-term contracts for veteran leadership.[74] 
The Indians improved significantly over the prior year and went into the 
All-Star break in second place. The team brought back Kenny Lofton for 
his third stint with the team in late July.[75] The Indians finished with 
a 96–66 record tied with the Red Sox for best in baseball, their seventh 
Central Division title in 13 years and their first post-season trip since 
2001.[76] The Indians began their playoff run by defeating the New York 
Yankees in the American League Division Series three games to one. This 
series will be most remembered for the swarm of bugs that overtook the 
field in the later innings of game 2. They also jumped out to a three-games-to-one 
lead over the Red Sox in the American League Championship Series. The season 
ended in disappointment when Boston swept the final three games to advance 
to the 2007 World Series.[76] Despite the loss, Cleveland players took 
home a number of awards. Grady Sizemore, who had a .995 fielding percentage 
and only two errors in 405 chances, won the Gold Glove award, Cleveland's 
first since 2001.[77] Indians Pitcher CC Sabathia won the second Cy Young 
Award in team history with a 19–7 record, a 3.21 ERA and an MLB-leading 
241 innings pitched.[78] Eric Wedge was awarded the first Manager of the 
Year Award in team history.[79] Shapiro was named to his second Executive 
of the Year in 2007.[71] The Indians struggled during the 2008 season. 
Injuries to sluggers Travis Hafner and Victor Martinez, as well as starting 
pitchers Jake Westbrook and Fausto Carmona led to a poor start.[80] The 
Indians, falling to last place for a short time in June and July, traded 
CC Sabathia to the Milwaukee Brewers for prospects Matt LaPorta, Rob Bryson, 
and Michael Brantley.[81] and traded starting third basemen, Casey Blake, 
for catching prospect Carlos Santana.[82] However, amid the mediocrity, 
some key players, such as shortstop Jhonny Peralta and catcher Kelly Shoppach, 
who took over starting duties after Martinez was injured, began to shine. 
Pitcher Cliff Lee went 22-3 with an ERA of 2.54 and earned the AL Cy Young 
Award.[83] Grady Sizemore had a career year, winning a Gold Glove and Silver 
Slugger,[84] and the Indians finished with a record of 81-81. Prospects 
for the 2009 season dimmed early when the Indians ended May with a record 
of 22-30. Shapiro made multiple trades: Cliff Lee and Ben Francisco to 
the Philadelphia Phillies for prospects Jason Knapp, Carlos Carrasco, Jason 
Donald and Lou Marson; Victor Martinez to the Boston Red Sox for prospects 
Bryan Price, Nick Hagadone and Justin Masterson; Ryan Garko to the Texas 
Rangers for Scott Barnes; and Kelly Shoppach to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 
for Mitch Talbot. The Indians finished the season tied for last in their 
division, with a record of 65-97. The team announced on September 30, 2009, 
that Eric Wedge and all of the team's coaching staff would be released 
at the end of the 2009 season.[85] Manny Acta was hired as the team's 40th 
manager on October 25, 2009.[86] On February 18, 2010, it was announced 
that Shapiro (following the end of the 2010 season) will be promoted to 
team President, with current President Paul Dolan becoming the new Chairman/CEO, 
and longtime Shapiro assistant Chris Antonetti filling the GM role.[87] 
On January 18, 2011, longtime popular former first baseman and manager 
Mike Hargrove was brought in as a special adviser. The Indians started 
2011 red-hot, going 30-15 in their first 45 games. The team remained around 
.500 and kept pace with the division leading Tigers through August, just 
1.5 games behind them with a record of 54-51 on July 28. However, after 
that point, the team collapsed, going 26-31 after that period, and finished 
80-82, but in second place in the AL Central, 15 games behind Detroit. 
Their record was the team's best since 2008 and a 15-game improvement over 
2010. The Tribe went into 2012 thinking they could contend for the Wild 
Card spot. They started the year well, leading the Central for most of 
April and May and switching places with Chicago in June. They entered the 
All-Star Break 44-41, just 3 games behind the White Sox for 1st place. 
The team looked poised for at least a winning season. The team deflated 
after the All-Star Game, going 9-19 immediately afterward and just 24-53 
after July 10 to finish 68-94, their worst record since 1991. The Indians 
soon fired their manager and hired Terry Francona, who led the Red Sox 
to the playoffs in 5 of his last 7 seasons and 2 World Series titles in 
4 years, including their first title since 1918. They also cut several 
minor players, including Grady Sizemore, who played only 1/4 of the previous 
3 seasons due to injury, none in 2012. All of the changes led to good hopes 
for 2013, and the team was up and down for most of May, but returned to
