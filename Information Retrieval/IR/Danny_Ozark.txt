Daniel Leonard Ozark, born Daniel Leonard Orzechowski (November 24, 1923 
– May 7, 2009) was an American coach and manager in Major League Baseball. 
As manager of the Philadelphia Phillies (1973 through August 31, 1979), 
Ozark led the Phils to three consecutive National League East Division 
championships (1976-77-78), but each year his team fell in the National 
League Championship Series. A native of Buffalo, New York, Ozark was a 
minor league first baseman who spent his playing career (1942; 1946–1961; 
1963) in the labyrinthine Brooklyn Dodgers farm system. He batted and threw 
right-handed. In 1956, Ozark became a playing manager with the Dodgers' 
Class B Wichita Falls farm club (Big State League) and rose through their 
system in succeeding years all the way to the AAA level, winning a division 
championship with the 1963 Spokane Indians of the Pacific Coast League. 
In 1965, he came to the Major Leagues — and the Los Angeles Dodgers — as 
a coach for Walter Alston. Ozark served eight years (1965–72) on Alston's 
staff until his hiring as manager by the last-place Phillies in October 
1972. The Phillies showed steady improvement in Ozark's first three seasons, 
and in 1976 broke through by winning 101 games, a club record at the time. 
The Philadelphia club featured a core of players led by two future Hall 
of Famers: third baseman Mike Schmidt and left-handed pitcher Steve Carlton. 
But in the 1976 NLCS, they faced one of the most powerful teams of the 
era, the defending world champion Cincinnati Reds, and they dropped the 
Series in three straight games, as the Reds went on to a second successive 
title. In 1977, the Phils again won 101 games to cruise to the NL East 
title. This time, against the Dodgers, they were poised to take a 2–1 Series 
lead when Los Angeles rallied for three runs in the ninth inning of Game 
3 to steal the victory. The following night, in the midst of a driving 
rainstorm, the disheartened Phils fell to Tommy John's complete game as 
the Dodgers won the pennant, three games to one. In 1978, they won only 
90 games, but still prevailed by two games in their division, earning the 
right to face the Dodgers in an NLCS rematch. Again the Phillies lost in 
four games. During the 1978–79 offseason, the Phils signed free agent Pete 
Rose away from the Reds. Fresh off his 44-game-hitting streak season, Rose 
was expected to put Philadelphia over the top in 1979. But the Phillies—plagued 
by injuries and a lack of pitching depth—played poorly all season and were 
still two games under .500 on August 31 when Ozark was replaced by Dallas 
Green.[1] Tommy Lasorda knew Ozark from the Dodgers organization. Lasorda 
selected Ozark to serve as a coach for the National League team for the 
1979 All-Star Game in Seattle. After the Phillies fired him, Ozark returned 
to the Dodgers to coach under Lasorda until the two had a falling-out during 
the 1982 season and Ozark was released. He joined the archrival San Francisco 
Giants as a coach in 1983–84 as a member of Frank Robinson's staff, and 
served as the Giants' interim manager in 1984 when Robinson was fired August 
5. The Giants won 24 and lost 32 under Ozark, remaining in the basement 
of the NL West. Throughout his managerial career, he was frequently lampooned 
for his malapropisms as a public speaker. Two of his most famous were "Half 
this game is 90% mental"[2] and "Even Napoleon had his Watergate."[3] On 
the morning of May 7, 2009, Ozark died at age 85 at his home in Vero Beach, 
Florida. Ozark is survived by his wife of 60 years, Ginny; two children, 
Dwain and Darlene; three granddaughters; and four great-grandchildren.[4] 
In 2010, Danny Ozark was inducted posthumously into the National Polish-American
