Edwin Donald "Duke" Snider (September 19, 1926 – February 27, 2011), nicknamed 
"The Silver Fox" and "The Duke of Flatbush", was an American professional 
baseball player. Usually assigned to center field, he spent most of his 
Major League Baseball (MLB) career playing for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles 
Dodgers (1947–62), later playing one season each for the New York Mets 
(1963) and San Francisco Giants (1964). He was named to the National League 
(NL) All-Star roster eight-times and was the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) 
runner-up in 1955. In his 16 out of 18 seasons with the Dodgers, he helped 
lead the Dodgers to six World Series, helping them win two championships 
in 1955 and 1959. Snider was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame 
in 1980. Born in Los Angeles, Snider was nicknamed "Duke" by his father 
at age five.[1] Growing up in Southern California, Snider was a gifted 
all-around athlete, playing basketball, football, and baseball at Compton 
High School, class of 1944. He was a strong-armed quarterback, who reportedly 
could throw the football 70 yards. Spotted by one of Branch Rickey's scouts 
in the early 1940s, he was signed to a baseball contract out of high school 
in 1943.[1] He played briefly for the Montreal Royals of the International 
League in 1944 (batting twice) and for the Newport News Dodgers in the 
Piedmont League in the same year. After serving in the U.S. Navy in 1945 
and part of 1946, he came back to play for the Fort Worth Cats that year, 
and also for St. Paul in 1947. Snider earned a tryout with the Brooklyn 
Dodgers during their spring training in 1947. He got to bat in the opening 
game on April 17 and hit a single. He played in 39 more games that season 
and became a friend of Jackie Robinson before he was sent to the St. Paul 
team in early July. Snider returned to the Dodgers at the end of the season 
in time for the World Series against the New York Yankees. Snider (after 
spring training with the Dodgers) started the 1948 season with Montreal, 
and after hitting well in that league with a .327 batting average, he was 
called up to Brooklyn in August and played in 53 games. In 1949, Snider 
became a regular major leaguer hitting 23 home runs with 92 runs batted 
in, helping the Dodgers into the World Series. Snider also saw his average 
climb from .244 to .292. A more mature Snider became the "trigger man" 
in a power-laden lineup which boasted players Joe Black, Roy Campanella, 
Billy Cox, Carl Erskine, Carl Furillo, Gil Hodges, Clem Labine, Pee Wee 
Reese, Jackie Robinson, and Preacher Roe. Often compared with two other 
New York center fielders, fellow Baseball Hall of Famers, Mickey Mantle 
and Willie Mays, he was the reigning "Duke" of Flatbush. In 1950, he hit 
.321. But when his average slipped to .277 in 1951, off 44 points from 
his previous mark, Snider caught the brunt of the sports‑page blame when 
the Dodgers squandered a 13‑game August lead and finished second to the 
Giants after Bobby Thomson's "Shot Heard 'Round the World". Snider recalls 
"I went to Walter O’Malley and told him I couldn’t take the pressure," 
Duke says. "I told him I’d just as soon be traded. I told him I figured 
I could do the Dodgers no good." Of course the trade did not happen.[2] 
Usually batting third in the line-up, Snider established some impressive 
offensive numbers: he hit 40 or more home runs in five consecutive seasons 
(1953–57), and between 1953–1956 averaged 42 home runs, 124 RBI, 123 runs, 
and a .320 batting average. He led the National league (NL) in runs scored, 
home runs, and RBI in separate seasons, and appeared in six post-seasons 
with the Dodgers (1949, 1952–53, 1955–56, 1959), facing the New York Yankees 
in the first five and the Chicago White Sox in the last. The Dodgers won 
the World Series in 1955 and in 1959. Snider's career numbers declined 
when the team moved to Los Angeles in 1958. Coupled with an aching knee 
and a 440-foot right field fence at the cavernous Coliseum, Snider hit 
only 15 home runs in 1958. However, he had one last hurrah in 1959 as he 
helped the Dodgers win their first World Series in Los Angeles. Duke rebounded 
that year to hit .308 with 23 home runs and 88 RBI in 370 at bats while 
sharing fielding duties in right and center fields with Don Demeter and 
rookie Ron Fairly. Injuries and age would eventually play a role in reducing 
Snider to part-time status by 1961. In 1962 when the Dodgers led the NL 
for most of the season (only to find themselves tied with the hated Giants 
at the season's end), it was Snider and third-base coach Leo Durocher who 
reportedly pleaded with manager Walter Alston to bring in future Hall of 
Fame pitcher (and Cy Young Award winner that year) Don Drysdale in the 
ninth inning of the third and deciding play-off game. Instead, Alston brought 
in Stan Williams to relieve a tiring Eddie Roebuck. A 4-2 lead turned into 
a 6-4 loss as the Giants rallied to win the pennant. Snider subsequently 
was sold to the New York Mets. It is said that Drysdale, his roommate, 
broke down and cried when he got the news of Snider's departure. When Snider 
joined the Mets, he discovered that his familiar number 4 was being worn 
by Charlie Neal, who refused to give it up. Snider wore number 11 during 
the first half of the season, then switched back to 4 after Neal was traded. 
He proved to be a sentimental favorite among former Dodger fans who now 
rooted for the Mets. But after one season, Snider asked to be traded to 
a contending team. Snider was sold to the San Francisco Giants on Opening 
Day in 1964. Knowing that he had no chance of wearing number 4, which had 
been worn by Mel Ott and retired by the Giants, Snider took number 28. 
He retired at the end of that season. He finished his major league career 
with a lifetime .295 batting average, 2,116 hits, 407 home runs, and 1,333 
RBI. Snider finished second to teammate Roy Campanella in the 1955 Most 
Valuable Player (MVP) balloting conducted by the Baseball Writers' Association 
of America. He trailed Campanella by just five points, 226-221, with each 
man receiving eight first-place votes. A widely believed story, summarized 
in an article by columnist Tracy Ringolsby,[3] holds that a hospitalized 
writer from Philadelphia had turned in a ballot with Campanella listed 
as his first-place and fifth-place vote. It was assumed that the writer 
had meant to write Snider's name into one of those slots. Unable to get 
a clarification from the ill writer, the BBWAA considered disallowing the 
ballot but decided to accept it, counting the first-place vote for Campanella 
and counting the fifth-place vote as though it were left blank. Had the 
ballot been disallowed, the vote would have been won by Snider 221-212. 
Had Snider gotten that now-blank fifth-place vote, the final vote would 
have favored Snider 227-226. Sportswriter Joe Posnanski, however, has suggested 
that this story is not entirely true.[4] Posnanski writes that there was 
a writer who did leave Snider off his ballot and write in Campanella's 
name twice, but it was in first and sixth positions, not first and fifth. 
Had Snider received the sixth place vote, the final tally would have created 
a tie, not a win for Snider. Additionally, the position was not discarded—everyone 
lower on the ballot was moved up a spot and the writer, and pitcher Jack 
Meyer was inserted at the bottom with a 10th place vote. Snider did win 
the Sporting News National League Player of the Year Award for 1955, and 
the Sid Mercer Award, emblematic of his selection by the New York branch 
of the BBWAA as the National League's best player of 1955.[5] Following 
his retirement from baseball, Snider became a popular and respected TV/radio 
analyst and play-by-play announcer for the San Diego Padres from 1969 to 
1971 and for the Montreal Expos from 1973 to 1986. He was characterized 
by a mellow, low-key style. Snider occasionally took acting roles, sometimes 
appearing in television or films as himself or as a professional baseball 
player. He played himself in "Hero Father" (1956) in the Robert Young television 
series "Father Knows Best" and made one guest appearance on the Chuck Connors 
television series "The Rifleman", playing Wallace in "The Retired Gun" 
(1959). Other appearances include an uncredited part as a Los Angeles Dodgers 
center fielder in "The Geisha Boy" (1958), the Cranker in "The Trouble 
with Girls" (1969), and a Steamer Fan in "Pastime" (1990). As recently 
as 2007, he was featured in "Brooklyn Dodgers: The Ghosts of Flatbush."[6] 
In 1995 Snider pleaded guilty to federal tax fraud charges. According to 
the charges, he had failed to report income from sports card shows and 
memorabilia sales.[7][8] Besides his selection to the Hall of Fame in 1980, 
in 1999 Snider was ranked 84 on The Sporting News's list of "100 Greatest 
Players",[9] and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century 
Team. Snider married Beverly Null in 1947; they had four children. Snider 
died on February 27, 2011, at age 84 of an undisclosed illness at the Valle 
Vista Convalescent Hospital in Escondido, California.[10] He was the last 
living Brooklyn Dodger who was on the field for the final out of the 1955
