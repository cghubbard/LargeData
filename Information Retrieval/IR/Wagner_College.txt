Wagner College is a private, national liberal arts college in the New York 
City borough of Staten Island, New York. Founded in 1883 and with a current 
enrollment of approximately 2,200 students, Wagner is known for its academic 
program, the Wagner Plan for the Practical Liberal Arts.[4] The college 
is regionally accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and 
Schools. Wagner College was founded in 1883 in Rochester, New York, as 
the Lutheran Proseminary of Rochester to train Lutheran ministers. Its 
six-year curriculum was modeled on the German gymnasium. In 1886, it was 
renamed Wagner Memorial Lutheran College after a building in Rochester 
was purchased for its use by John G. Wagner in memory of his son. The college 
moved to the 38-acre (15 ha) former Cunard estate on Grymes Hill, Staten 
Island, in 1918. Westwood, the Cunard mansion which dates from 1851, is 
extant (now Cunard Hall) as is the neighboring former hotel annex that 
was built in 1905 (initially named North Hall and is now Reynolds House). 
The college soon expanded to 57 acres (23 ha) after it acquired the neighboring 
Jacob Vanderbilt estate in 1922. In the 1920s, the curriculum began to 
move toward an American-style curriculum which was solidified when the 
state of New York granted the college degree-granting status in 1928. The 
college admitted women in 1933 and introduced graduate programs in 1951. 
The college expanded further when it purchased the W.G. Ward estate in 
1949 (current site of Wagner College Stadium), and again in 1993, when 
the college acquired the adjacent property of the former Augustinian Academy, 
which has largely remained wooded greenspace and athletic fields. The college 
now occupies 105 acres (42 ha) on the hill and has commanding views of 
New York harbor, the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, Downtown Brooklyn, and lower 
Manhattan. In the early 1960s, the Wagner College Writer's Conference hosted 
several prominent writers, including Edward Albee, Kay Boyle, and Kenneth 
Koch. Prominent buildings include Main Hall (1930) and Parker Hall (1923) 
built in the collegiate Gothic style. A group of modern buildings built 
in the 1960s include the Student Union (1970), Megerle Science Building 
(1968), and the Spiro Communication Center (1968). The Horrmann Library 
(1961) contains over 200,000 volumes and holds the collection and personal 
papers of poet Edwin Markham. 67% of the undergraduates live in one of 
four residence halls. The Spiro Sports Center (1999) was the most recent 
major addition, until early 2010 when the college opened Foundation Hall, 
a residence hall for upperclassmen. In 2007 it was announced that a new 
academic building is under development for construction on the site of 
the former Augustinian High School. It will be a state-of-the-art facility 
that will house the business, nursing, and education departments. It will 
also house new and state-of-the-art classrooms. The project is now in the 
final planning stages. The Union Art Gallery at Wagner College features 
works from students, faculty and alumni. Located on the main floor of the 
college union building, the Union Art Gallery serves as a space for visiting 
artists to directly engage with the student body in this one room gallery. 
Undergraduate admissions to Wagner College are classified as "more selective" 
by US News & World Report and The Princeton Review, making admission into 
Wagner College competitive. The average incoming high school grade point 
average is 3.45. About 97% of incoming students graduate in the top half 
of their classes. The average incoming SAT score for critical reading is: 
530–640, math: 530–650, writing: 520–650. The average incoming ACT score 
is between 25 and 28. Important admissions factors are class rank, rigor 
of secondary school record, academic GPA, application essay, extracurricular 
activities, recommendations, and standardized test scores. Tuition, room 
and board for full-time undergraduate students (9 units) during the 2015–2016 
academic year was $55,030. About 87% of students receive financial aid. 
Wagner College offers various academic and athletic scholarships. Wagner 
College offers athletic scholarships and competes at the NCAA Division 
I level in all intercollegiate athletics (football competes at the NCAA 
Division I FCS (Formerly I-AA) level). Wagner is a full-time member of 
the Northeast Conference (NEC) along with Bryant University, Central Connecticut 
State University, Fairleigh Dickinson University, Long Island University, 
Mount Saint Mary's University, Quinnipiac University, Robert Morris University, 
Sacred Heart University, Saint Francis College, and Saint Francis University. 
Wagner is the seventh smallest college in the country that participates 
in NCAA Division I athletics and the third smallest in the NEC. Men's varsity 
intercollegiate teams are fielded in baseball, basketball, cross country, 
football, golf, lacrosse, tennis, and track & field. Men's water polo starts

cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track

club sport schedule. On March 12, 2009, Wagner announced the discontinuation 
of the men's wrestling and women's volleyball programs. The football and 
men's basketball teams are Wagner's most popular and prestigious athletic 
programs. Walt Hameline, in 29 years as the Director of Athletics and Head 
Football Coach at Wagner, won the school's only National Championship with 
a 19–3 victory over the University of Dayton in the 1987 NCAA Division 
III Championship game, also known as the 1987 Stagg Bowl. He was named 
NCAA Division III Coach of the Year in 1987. Hameline's 204–122–2 (.624) 
career record ranks in the top 10 among all Division I-FCS coaches in the 
United States. Notable Wagner coaches of the past include former Brooklyn 
Nets coach and current ESPN analyst P.J. Carlesimo (Head Basketball Coach 
1976–1982), former Marquette University and Wagner Head Coach Mike Deane 
who is currently an Assistant Men's Basketball Coach at James Madison University, 
Jim Lee Howell (Head Football Coach 1947–1953), and current Mississippi 
State University Head Football Coach Dan Mullen (Assistant Football Coach 
1994–1995). The football team's home venue is Wagner College Stadium, while 
the basketball team plays its home games at the Spiro Sports Center. The 
Wagner College Athletic Department has been cited by the US News & World 
Report for having the 15th best graduation rate in intercollegiate athletics 
amongst more than 300 Division I colleges. Wagner also captured its second 
straight Northeast Conference Institutional Academic Award (Highest Student-Athlete 
GPA) for the 2007–08 athletic/academic seasons with an average GPA of 3.186 
in 19 sports. View from residence hall: Downtown Brooklyn and Brooklyn
