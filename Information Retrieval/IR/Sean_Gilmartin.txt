Sean Patrick Gilmartin (born May 8, 1990) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB). Gilmartin 
was the 28th overall selection in the 2011 MLB Draft by the Atlanta Braves. 
Prior to beginning his professional career, Gilmartin attended Florida 
State University, and was an All-American pitcher for the Seminoles baseball 
team. Gilmartin was born in Moorpark, California and attended Crespi Carmelite 
High School in Encino, California. After graduating from high school, the 
San Diego Padres selected Gilmartin in the 31st round of the 2008 Major 
League Baseball Draft. Gilmartin opted not to sign with San Diego, instead 
attending college.[1] Gilmartin enrolled at Florida State University in 
2009, receiving a scholarship to play college baseball for the Florida 
State Seminoles baseball team. As a junior in 2011, Gilmartin was named 
an All-American by Baseball America.[2] Gilmartin was drafted by the Atlanta 
Braves in the first round, with the 28th overall selection, of the 2011 
Major League Baseball Draft.[3] He signed with the Braves, receiving a 
$1,134,000 signing bonus.[1] Gilmartin in the Atlanta farm system has played 
with the Gulf Coast League Braves, Rome Braves, Mississippi Braves, and 
the Gwinnett Braves. Prior to the 2012 season, Gilmartin was ranked as 
the Braves fifth best prospect by Baseball America.[4] Gilmartin was invited 
to spring training in 2013, but did not make the team.[5] He played for 
the Gwinnett Braves of the Class AAA International League, though his performance 
was limited by shoulder injuries.[6] After the 2013 season, the Braves 
traded Gilmartin to the Minnesota Twins for Ryan Doumit on December 18, 
2013.[7][8] He pitched for the New Britain Rock Cats and the Rochester 
Red Wings in 2014. Gilmartin with the Rock Cats finished 7-3, 3.12 ERA 
in 12 games in 72 innings pitched with 74 strikeouts with a WHIP of 1.278 
while giving up 76 hits, 30 runs (25 of them earned), 2 home runs, and 
16 walks. With the Red Wings he finished 2-4, 4.28 ERA in 14 games in 73.2 
innings pitched with 59 strikeouts with a WHIP of 1.317 while giving up 
69 hits, 39 runs (35 of them earned), 7 home runs, and 28 walks. During 
the 2014 Winter Meetings, the New York Mets selected Gilmartin from the 
Twins in the Rule 5 draft on December 11.[9] Gilmartin competed to make 
the Mets' Opening Day 25-man roster as a relief pitcher and got a spot 
in the bullpen.[10] Gilmartin made his major league debut on April 10 against 
the Braves in a 3-5 loss getting Nick Markakis to groundout and striking 
out Freddie Freeman to end the seventh inning.[11] On June 14, Gilmartin 
got his first win against the Braves pitching two scoreless innings in 
both the fifth and the sixth inning. He faced seven batters, walking one, 
and striking out three in 10-8 win.[12] On July 19, he got his first major 
league hit, a bloop single into left field off Carlos Mart√≠nez, in his 
first at-bat in the sixteenth inning against the St. Louis Cardinals.[13] 
Gilmartin pitched three scoreless innings in the fourteenth, fifteenth 
and the sixteenth innings giving up 1 hit, 2 walks and getting 4 strikeouts 
while facing 12 batters.[14] After the Mets clinched the National League 
East division title, Gilmartin made his first major league start on October 
1 against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park throwing five 
innings. He struck out three batters and allowed two runs and three hits, 
throwing 44 of 70 pitches for strikes. He retired 11 of the first 12 batters 
he faced in a game that lasted just 2 hours, 23 minutes.[15] The two runs 
he allowed came on Darin Ruf's two-run home run in the 4th inning.[16] 
However, the Mets lost 0-3 to the Phillies and the loss marked the first 
time the Phillies swept the Mets at Citizens Bank Park since 2009.[17] 
When the Mets made the playoffs, Gilmartin was not on the roster for the 
Division Series but he was added on the roster for the Championship Series 
replacing Erik Goeddel.[18] Gilmartin did not appear in the championship 
series. Gilmartin appeared in game two of the World Series in the top of 
the eight inning getting the two batters he faced out. Gilmartin finished 
the 2015 season 3-2, 2.67 ERA in 50 games (one start) in 57.1 innings pitched 
with 54 strikeouts with a WHIP of 1.186 while giving up 50 hits, 17 runs, 
2 home runs, and 19 walks. Gilmartin was cut from the roster heading into 
the 2016 season as veteran reliever Jim Henderson beat him out for the 
last job in the bullpen during spring training.[19] Gilmartin was recalled 
up to the Mets on May 12 with Wilmer Flores going on the disabled list. 
Gilmartin with the 51s pitched in 32.2 innings with a 4-1 record with a 
2.48 ERA and 1.13 WHIP.[20] Gilmartin was sent back down to the 51s to 
make room for Matt Reynolds on the roster.[21] Gilmartin pitched five scoreless 
innings in two games giving up two hits and striking out five batters.
