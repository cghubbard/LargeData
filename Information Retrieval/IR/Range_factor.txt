Range Factor (commonly abbreviated RF) is a baseball statistic developed 
by Bill James. It is calculated by dividing putouts and assists by the 
number of innings or games played at a given defense position.[1] The statistic 
is premised on the notion that the total number of outs in which a player 
participates is more relevant in evaluating that player's defensive play 
than the percentage of cleanly handled chances as calculated by the conventional 
statistic fielding percentage. However, some positions (especially first

around them that commits fewer errors and turns many double plays, allowing 
them to receive credit for more putouts. Also, catchers who have a lot
