The 1944 St. Louis Browns season was a season in American baseball. It 
involved the Browns finishing first in the American League with a record 
of 89 wins and 65 losses. In the World Series, they lost to the crosstown 
Cardinals, four games to two. The Browns were one of the unlikeliest pennant-winners 
in history; in nine out of the previous 10 seasons, they had finished in 
the second division. However, 1944 was the peak of wartime baseball. The 
shortage of players dragged the talent level of the entire league down, 
which benefitted the team. The 1944 Browns were relatively untouched by 
the military draft. Nine players on the roster were 34 years old or older. 
Their all-4F infield included 23-year-old shortstop Vern Stephens, who 
led the league in RBI (109) and was second in home runs (20). St. Louis 
started the season with nine straight wins and continued to hang tough 
in a four-team race with Detroit, Boston, and New York. It came down to 
the final week, when the Browns defeated the Yankees five times, winning 
the pennant by 1 game over Detroit. It would be the only championship the 
franchise would ever win in St. Louis. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]
