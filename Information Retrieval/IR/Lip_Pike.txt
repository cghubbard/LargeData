Lipman Emanuel "Lip" Pike (May 25, 1845 – October 10, 1893)[1] the "Iron 
Batter",[2] was one of the stars of 19th century baseball in the United 
States.[2][3] He was one of the first professional players,[4][5] as well 
as the first Jewish player.[6] His brother, Israel Pike, played briefly 
for the Hartford Dark Blues during the 1877 season. Pike was born in New 
York into a Jewish Dutch family, and grew up in Brooklyn.[2] His father 
was a haberdasher.[7] Pike was one of the premier players of his day. He 
was a great slugger and one of the best home run hitters, so much so that 
stories about balls he hit were told for quite some time after he stopped 
playing. Pike began in baseball when he was thirteen.[8] Pike first rose 
to prominence playing for the Philadelphia Athletics, whom he joined in 
1866.[3] He brought an impressive blend of power and speed to the team, 
hitting many home runs as well as being one of the fastest players around. 
On one occasion he hit 6 home runs in one game.[2] However, it was soon 
brought to light that he and two other Philadelphia players were being 
given $20 a week to play (equivalent to $324 in 2015).[3][5] Since all 
baseball players were ostensibly amateurs (though many were, like Pike, 
accepting money under the table), a hearing was set up by the sport's governing 
body, the National Association of Base Ball Players. In the end, no one 
showed up to the hearing, and the matter was dropped. By 1869, the Cincinnati 
Red Stockings became the first openly professional team, and Pike's hearing, 
farcical as it seems to have been, paved the way for Harry Wright's professionalization 
of baseball. The Athletics were very successful, but Pike was dropped from 
the team in 1867, because he was from New York, and thus a 'foreigner,' 
calling his loyalty into question. He moved on to the Irvington, New Jersey 
club and later in 1867 to the New York Mutuals, always a leading team, 
where he returned for 1868, having caught the eye of Boss Tweed. In 1869 
he moved to the Brooklyn Atlantics, another perennial leader, where he 
hit .610. In 1870, the Atlantics, with Pike manning second base, finally 
ended Cincinnati's 93-game winning streak. In 1871, the National Association 
was formed as the first professional baseball league, and Pike joined the 
Troy Haymakers for its inaugural season. He was their star and for 4 games 
was the captain and manager,[3] batting .377 (6th best in the league) and 
hitting a league-leading 4 home runs. He also led the league in extra base 
hits (21), and was 2nd in slugging percentage (.654) and doubles (10), 
4th in RBIs (39), 5th in triples (7), 6th in on-base percentage (.400), 
9th in hits (49), and 10th in runs (43). The Haymakers only finished 6th, 
though, and the team's captaincy switched to Bill Craver. The Haymakers 
revamped their roster for the 1872 season, and Pike headed for Baltimore, 
where he played for the Baltimore Canaries. Pike had another excellent 
season, leading the league in home runs again (with 6), RBIs (60), and 
games (56), and coming in 2nd in total bases (127) and extra base hits 
(26), 3rd in at bats (288), 5th in doubles (15) and triples (5), 9th in 
slugging percentage (.441) and stolen bases (8), and 10th in hits (84). 
In 1873 Pike led the league in home runs for the 3rd consecutive season, 
hitting 4, and was 2nd in triples (8), 4th in total bases (132), stolen 
bases (8), and extra base hits (26), 7th in slugging percentage (.462), 
8th in doubles (14), RBIs (50), and at bats (286), 9th in hits (90), and 
10th in games (56). Baltimore went bankrupt after the season, so Pike headed 
off to captain the Hartford Dark Blues for the 1874 season. The Dark Blues 
were a poor team, but Pike had another fine season, slugging .574 to lead 
the league, and coming in 2nd with an on-base percentage of .368. Pike 
abandoned the weak Hartford team after a single season, switching to the 
St. Louis Brown Stockings. For the first time in his professional career, 
Pike failed to hit a home run, although he stole 25 bases. He also hit 
12 triples and 22 doubles (leading the league) in what was probably his 
finest offensive season. In all Lip Pike has the NA career home run (15), 
and extra base hits (135) records In 1876, when the National League replaced 
the National Association, Pike stuck with St. Louis. The Brown Stockings 
turned in a very good season, finishing a solid 2nd to the Chicago White 
Stockings. Pike continued to produce offensively, notching totals of 133 
total bases (5th in the league) and 34 extra-base hits (2nd). Seemingly 
never content to stay with a team very long, Pike headed to the Cincinnati 
Reds for the 1877 season. The Reds finished last. Pike was still a top-quality 
player, leading the league in home runs for the 4th time in the 1870s.[8] 
However, age was starting to catch up with the 32-year-old Pike. He began 
the season as the 8th-oldest player in the league, and was the 4th oldest 
player of the 1878 season. The 1878 Reds played very well, though. They 
finished 2nd, but Pike was replaced by Buttercup Dickerson halfway through 
the season and forced to look elsewhere for a team. He ended up playing 
a few games for the Providence Grays, and spent the next 2 years playing 
for minor league teams. Sporting Life subsequently named him an outfielder 
on its 1870–80 All-Star team.[2] Pike got a brief call-up in 1881 to play 
for the Worcester Ruby Legs,[9] but the 36-year-old Pike could no longer 
play effectively, hitting .111 and not managing a single extra base hit 
in 18 at-bats over 5 games. His play was so poor as to arouse suspicions, 
and Pike found himself banned from the National League that September. 
He was added to the National League blacklist in 1881. He turned to haberdashery,[9] 
the vocation of his father, and spent another 6 years playing only amateur 
baseball. He was reinstated in 1883. In 1887, the New York Metropolitans 
of the American Association gave Pike another chance. At 42, he was the 
oldest player in baseball. The only game he played was more of a sending 
off than a new start, though, and Pike headed back to his haberdashery 
once more. In 1936, decades after he died, he received a vote in the elections 
for the Baseball Hall of Fame.[2] Pike was also one of the fastest players 
in the league. He would occasionally race any challenger for a cash prize, 
routinely coming out the winner.[10] On August 16, 1873, he raced a fast 
trotting horse named "Clarence" in a 100-yard sprint at Baltimore's Newington 
Park, and won by four yards with a time of 10 seconds flat, earning $250 
($4,950 today).[3] Pike died suddenly of heart disease at the age of 48 
in 1893.[2] The Brooklyn Eagle reported that "Many wealthy Hebrews and 
men high in political and old time baseball circles attended the funeral 
service".[11] He was interred in the Salem Fields Cemetery in Brooklyn, 
New York. He was considered the first professional baseball player and 
the first famous Jewish baseball player, and was inducted into the International
