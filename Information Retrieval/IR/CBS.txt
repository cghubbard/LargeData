CBS (an initialism of the network's former name, the Columbia Broadcasting 
System) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is 
a flagship property of CBS Corporation. The company is headquartered at 
the CBS Building in New York City with major production facilities and 
operations in New York City (at the CBS Broadcast Center) and Los Angeles 
(at CBS Television City and the CBS Studio Center). CBS is sometimes referred 
to as the "Eye Network", in reference to the company's iconic logo, in 
use since 1951. It has also been called the "Tiffany Network", alluding 
to the perceived high quality of CBS programming during the tenure of its 
founder William S. Paley.[2] It can also refer to some of CBS's first demonstrations 
of color television, which were held in a former Tiffany & Co. building 
in New York City in 1950.[3] The network has its origins in United Independent 
Broadcasters Inc., a collection of 16 radio stations that was purchased 
by Paley in 1928 and renamed the Columbia Broadcasting System.[4] Under 
Paley's guidance, CBS would first become one of the largest radio networks 
in the United States, and eventually one of the Big Three American broadcast 
television networks. In 1974, CBS dropped its former full name and became 
known simply as CBS, Inc. The Westinghouse Electric Corporation acquired 
the network in 1995, renamed its corporate entity to the current CBS Broadcasting, 
Inc. in 1997, and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired 
to become CBS Corporation. In 2000, CBS came under the control of Viacom, 
which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971. In late 2005, Viacom split 
itself into two separate companies, and re-established CBS Corporation 
– through the spin-off of its broadcast television, radio and select cable 
television and non-broadcasting assets – with the CBS television network 
at its core. CBS Corporation is controlled by Sumner Redstone through National 
Amusements, which also controls the current Viacom. CBS continues to operate 
the CBS Radio network, which now mainly provides news and features content 
for its portfolio of owned-and-operated radio stations in large and mid-sized 
markets, and affiliated radio stations in various other markets. The television 
network has more than 240 owned-and-operated and affiliated television 
stations throughout the United States. The origins of CBS date back to 
January 27, 1927, with the creation of the "United Independent Broadcasters" 
network in Chicago by New York City talent-agent Arthur Judson. The fledgling 
network soon needed additional investors though, and the Columbia Phonograph 
Company, manufacturers of Columbia Records, rescued it in April 1927; as 
a result, the network was renamed the "Columbia Phonographic Broadcasting 
System" on September 18 of that year. Columbia Phonographic went on the 
air on September 18, 1927, with a presentation by the Howard Barlow Orchestra[5] 
from flagship station WOR in Newark, New Jersey, and fifteen affiliates.[6] 
Operational costs were steep, particularly the payments to AT&T for use 
of its land lines, and by the end of 1927, Columbia Phonograph wanted out.[7] 
In early 1928 Judson sold the network to brothers Isaac and Leon Levy, 
owners of the network's Philadelphia affiliate WCAU, and their partner 
Jerome Louchenheim. None of the three were interested in assuming day-to-day 
management of the network, so they installed wealthy 26-year-old William 
S. Paley, son of a Philadelphia cigar family and in-law of the Levys, as 
president. With the record company out of the picture, Paley quickly streamlined 
the corporate name to "Columbia Broadcasting System".[7] He believed in 
the power of radio advertising since his family's "La Palina" cigars had 
doubled their sales after young William convinced his elders to advertise 
on radio.[8] By September 1928, Paley bought out the Louchenheim share 
of CBS and became its majority owner with 51% of the business.[9] During 
Louchenheim's brief regime, Columbia paid $410,000 to A.H. Grebe's Atlantic 
Broadcasting Company for a small Brooklyn station, WABC (no relation to 
the current WABC), which would become the network's flagship station. WABC 
was quickly upgraded, and the signal relocated to 860 kHz.[10] The physical 
plant was relocated also – to Steinway Hall on West 57th Street in Manhattan, 
where much of CBS's programming would originate. By the turn of 1929, the 
network could boast to sponsors of having 47 affiliates.[11] Paley moved 
right away to put his network on a firmer financial footing. In the fall 
of 1928, he entered into talks with Adolph Zukor of Paramount Pictures, 
who planned to move into radio in response to RCA's forays into motion 
pictures with the advent of talkies.[12] The deal came to fruition in September 
1929: Paramount acquired 49% of CBS in return for a block of its stock 
worth $3.8 million at the time.[8] The agreement specified that Paramount 
would buy that same stock back by March 1, 1932 for a flat $5 million, 
provided CBS had earned $2 million during 1931 and 1932.[12] For a brief 
time there was talk that the network might be renamed "Paramount Radio", 
but it only lasted a month – the 1929 stock market crash sent all stock 
value tumbling. It galvanized Paley and his troops, who "had no alternative 
but to turn the network around and earn the $2,000,000 in two years.... 
This is the atmosphere in which the CBS of today was born."[12] The near-bankrupt 
movie studio sold its CBS shares back to CBS in 1932.[13] In the first 
year of Paley's watch, CBS's gross earnings more than tripled, going from 
$1.4 million to $4.7 million.[14] Much of the increase was a result of 
Paley's second upgrade to the CBS business plan – improved affiliate relations. 
There were two types of program at the time: sponsored and sustaining, 
i.e., unsponsored. Rival NBC paid affiliates for every sponsored show they 
carried and charged them for every sustaining show they ran.[15] It was 
onerous for small and medium stations, and resulted in both unhappy affiliates 
and limited carriage of sustaining programs. Paley had a different idea, 
designed to get CBS programs emanating from as many radio sets as possible:[16] 
he would give the sustaining programs away for free, provided the station 
would run every sponsored show, and accept CBS's check for doing so.[17] 
CBS soon had more affiliates than either NBC Red or NBC Blue.[18] Paley 
was a man who valued style and taste,[19] and in 1929, once he had his 
affiliates happy and his company's creditworthiness on the mend, he relocated 
his concern to sleek, new 485 Madison Avenue, the "heart of the advertising 
community, right where Paley wanted his company to be"[20] and where it 
would stay until its move to its own Eero Saarinen-designed headquarters, 
the CBS Building, in 1965. When his new landlords expressed skepticism 
about the network and its fly-by-night reputation, Paley overcame their 
qualms by inking a lease for $1.5 million.[20] Since NBC was the broadcast 
arm of radio set manufacturer RCA, its chief David Sarnoff approached his 
decisions as both a broadcaster and as a hardware executive; NBC's affiliates 
had the latest RCA equipment, and were often the best-established stations, 
or were on "clear channel" frequencies. Yet Sarnoff's affiliates were mistrustful 
of him. Paley had no such split loyalties: his – and his affiliates' – 
success rose and fell with the quality of CBS programming.[16] Paley had 
an innate, pitch-perfect, sense of entertainment, "a gift of the gods, 
an ear totally pure",[21] wrote David Halberstam. "[He] knew what was good 
and would sell, what was bad and would sell, and what was good and would 
not sell, and he never confused one with another."[22] As the 1930s loomed, 
Paley set about building the CBS talent stable. The network became the 
home of many popular musical and comedy stars, among them Jack Benny, ("Your 
Canada Dry Humorist"), Al Jolson, George Burns & Gracie Allen, and Kate 
Smith, whom Paley personally selected for his family's La Palina Hour because 
she was not the type of woman to provoke jealousy in American wives.[23] 
When, on a mid-ocean voyage, Paley heard a phonograph record of a young 
unknown crooner, he rushed to the ship's radio room and "cabled" New York 
to sign Bing Crosby immediately to a contract for a daily radio show.[24] 
While the CBS prime-time lineup featured music, comedy and variety shows, 
the daytime schedule was a direct conduit into American homes – and into 
the hearts and minds of American women; for many, it was the bulk of their 
adult human contact during the course of the day. CBS time salesmen recognized 
early on that this intimate connection could be a bonanza for advertisers 
of female-interest products.[25] Starting in 1930, astrologer Evangeline 
Adams would consult the heavens on behalf of listeners who sent in their 
birthdays, a description of their problems – and a box-top from sponsor 
Forhan's toothpaste.[26] The low-key murmuring of smooth-voiced Tony Wons, 
backed by a tender violin, "made him a soul mate to millions of women"[27] 
on behalf of the R. J. Reynolds tobacco company, whose cellophane-wrapped 
Camel cigarettes were "as fresh as the dew that dawn spills on a field 
of clover".[28] The most popular radio-friend of all was M. Sayle Taylor, 
The Voice Of Experience, though his name was never uttered on air.[28] 
Women mailed descriptions of the most intimate of relationship problems 
to The Voice in the tens of thousands per week; sponsors Musterole ointment 
and Haley's M–O laxative enjoyed sales increases of several hundred percent 
in just the first month of The Voice Of Experience's run.[29] As the decade 
progressed, a new genre joined the daytime lineup: serial dramas – soap 
operas, so named for the products that sponsored them, by way of the ad 
agencies that actually produced them. Although the form, usually in quarter-hour 
episodes, proliferated widely in the mid- and late 1930s, they all had 
the same basic premise: that characters "fell into two categories: 1) those 
in trouble and 2) those who helped people in trouble. The helping-hand 
figures were usually older."[30] At CBS, Just Plain Bill brought human 
insight and Anacin pain reliever into households; Your Family and Mine 
came courtesy of Sealtest Dairy products; Bachelor's Children first hawked 
Old Dutch Cleanser, then Wonder Bread; Aunt Jenny's Real Life Stories was 
sponsored by Spry Vegetable Shortening. Our Gal Sunday (Anacin again), 
The Romance of Helen Trent (Angélus cosmetics), Big Sister (Rinso laundry 
soap) and many others filled the daytime ether.[31] Thanks to its daytime 
and primetime schedules, CBS prospered in the 1930s. In 1935, gross sales 
were $19.3 million, yielding a profit of $2.27 million.[32] By 1937, the 
network took in $28.7 million and had 114 affiliates,[16] almost all of 
which cleared 100% of network-fed programming, thus keeping ratings, and 
revenue, high. In 1938, CBS even acquired the American Record Corporation, 
parent of its one-time investor Columbia Records.[33] In 1938, NBC and 
CBS each opened studios in Hollywood to attract the entertainment industry's 
top talent to their networks – NBC at Radio City on Sunset Boulevard and 
Vine Street, CBS two blocks away at Columbia Square.[34] The extraordinary 
potential of radio news showed itself in 1930, when CBS suddenly found 
itself with a live telephone connection to a prisoner called "The Deacon" 
who described, from the inside and in real time, a riot and conflagration 
at the Ohio Penitentiary; for CBS, it was "a shocking journalistic coup".[35] 
Yet as late as 1934, there was still no regularly scheduled newscast on 
network radio: "Most sponsors did not want network news programming; those 
that did were inclined to expect veto rights over it."[36] There had been 
a longstanding wariness between radio and the newspapers as well; the papers 
had rightly concluded that the upstart radio business would compete with 
them on two counts – advertising dollars and news coverage. By 1933, they 
fought back, many no longer publishing radio schedules for readers' convenience, 
or allowing "their" news to be read on the air for radio's profit.[37] 
Radio, in turn, pushed back when urban department stores, newspapers' largest 
advertisers and themselves owners of many radio stations, threatened to 
withhold their ads from print.[38] A short-lived attempted truce in 1933 
even saw the papers proposing that radio be forbidden from running news 
before 9:30 a.m., and then only after 9:00 p.m. – and that no news story 
could air until it was 12 hours old.[39] It was in this climate that Paley 
set out to "enhance the prestige of CBS, to make it seem in the public 
mind the more advanced, dignified and socially aware network".[40] He did 
it through sustaining programming like the New York Philharmonic, the thoughtful 
drama of Norman Corwin – and an in-house news division to gather and present 
news, free of fickle suppliers like newspapers and wire services.[40] In 
the fall of 1934, CBS launched an independent news division, shaped in 
its first years by Paley's vice-president, former New York Times columnist 
Ed Klauber, and news director Paul White. Since there was no blueprint 
or precedent for real-time news coverage, early efforts of the new division 
used the shortwave link-up CBS had been using for five years[41] to bring 
live feeds of European events to its American air. A key early hire was 
Edward R. Murrow in 1935; his first corporate title was Director of Talks. 
He was mentored in microphone technique by Robert Trout, the lone full-time 
member of the News Division, and quickly found himself in a growing rivalry 
with boss White.[42] Murrow was glad to "leave the hothouse atmosphere 
of the New York office behind"[43] when he was dispatched to London as 
CBS's European Director in 1937, a time when the growing Hitler menace 
underscored the need for a robust European Bureau. Halberstam described 
Murrow in London as "the right man in the right place in the right era".[44] 
Murrow began assembling the staff of broadcast journalists – including 
William L. Shirer, Charles Collingwood, Bill Downs, and Eric Sevareid – 
who would become known as "Murrow's Boys". They were "in [Murrow's] own 
image, sartorially impeccable, literate, often liberal, and prima donnas 
all".[45] They covered history in the making, and sometimes made it themselves: 
on March 12, 1938, Hitler boldly annexed nearby Austria and Murrow and 
Boys quickly assembled coverage with Shirer in London, Edgar Ansel Mowrer 
in Paris, Pierre Huss in Berlin, Frank Gervasi in Rome and Trout in New 
York.[46] This bore the News Round-Up format, which is still ubiquitous 
today in broadcast news. Murrow's nightly reports from the rooftops during 
the dark days of the London Blitz galvanized American listeners: even before 
Pearl Harbor, the conflict became "the story of the survival of Western 
civilization, the most heroic of all possible wars and stories. He was 
indeed reporting on the survival of the English-speaking peoples."[47] 
With his "manly, tormented voice",[48] Murrow contained and mastered the 
panic and danger he felt, thereby communicating it all the more effectively 
to his audience.[48] Using his trademark self-reference "This reporter",[49] 
he did not so much report news as interpret it, combining simplicity of 
expression with subtlety of nuance.[48] Murrow himself said he tried "to 
describe things in terms that make sense to the truck driver without insulting 
the intelligence of the professor".[48] When he returned home for a visit 
late in 1941, Paley threw an "extraordinarily elaborate reception"[50] 
for Murrow at the Waldorf-Astoria. Of course, its goal was more than just 
honoring CBS's latest "star" – it was an announcement to the world that 
Mr. Paley's network was finally more than just a pipeline carrying other 
people's programming: it had now become a cultural force in its own right.[51] 
Once the war was over and Murrow returned for good, it was as "a superstar 
with prestige and freedom and respect within his profession and within 
his company".[52] He possessed enormous capital within that company, and 
as the unknown form of television news loomed large, he would spend it 
freely, first in radio news, then in television, taking on Senator Joseph 
McCarthy first, then eventually William S. Paley himself,[53] and with 
a foe that formidable, even the vast Murrow account would soon run dry. 
On October 30, 1938, CBS gained a taste of infamy when The Mercury Theatre 
on the Air broadcast a radio adaptation of H. G. Wells's The War of the 
Worlds, performed by Orson Welles. Its unique format, a contemporary version 
of the story in the form of faux news broadcasts, had panicked many listeners 
into believing invaders from Mars were actually invading and devastating 
Grover's Mill, New Jersey, despite three disclaimers during the broadcast 
that it was a work of fiction. The flood of publicity after the broadcast 
had two effects: an FCC ban on faux news bulletins within dramatic programming, 
and sponsorship for The Mercury Theatre on the Air – the former sustaining 
program became The Campbell Playhouse to sell soup.[54] Welles, for his 
part, summarized the episode as "the Mercury Theater's own radio version 
of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying 'Boo!'"[55] 
Before the onset of World War II, in 1940, CBS recruited Edmund A. Chester 
from his position as Bureau Chief for Latin America at the Associated Press 
to serve as Director of Latin American Relations and Director of Short 
Wave Broadcasts for the CBS radio network. In this capacity, Mr. Chester 
coordinated the development of the Network of the Americas (La Cadena de 
las Americas) with the Department of State, the Office for Inter-American 
Affairs (as chaired by Nelson Rockefeller) and Voice of America. This network 
provided vital news and cultural programming throughout South America and 
Central America during the crucial World War II era and fostered diplomatic 
relations between the United States and the less developed nations of the 
continent. It featured such popular radio broadcasts as Viva América[56] 
which showcased leading musical talent from both North and South America, 
accompanied by the CBS Pan American Orchestra under the musical direction 
of Alfredo Antonini. The post-war era also marked the beginning of CBS's 
dominance in the field of radio as well.[57] As 1939 wound down, Bill Paley 
announced that 1940 would "be the greatest year in the history of radio 
in the United States."[58] He turned out to be right by more than anyone 
could imagine: the decade of the 1940s would indeed be the apogee of network 
radio by every gauge. Nearly 100% of the advertisers who made sponsorship 
deals in 1939 renewed their contracts for 1940; manufacturers of farm tractors 
made radios standard equipment on their machines.[59] Wartime rationing 
of paper limited the size of newspapers – and effectively advertisements 
– and when papers turned them away, they migrated to radio sponsorship.[60] 
A 1942 act by Congress made advertising expenses a tax benefit[60] and 
that sent even automobile and tire manufacturers – who had no products 
to sell since they had been converted to war production – scurrying to 
sponsor symphony orchestras and serious drama on radio.[61] In 1940, only 
one-third of radio programs were sponsored, while two-thirds were sustaining; 
by the middle of the decade, the statistics had swapped – two out of three 
shows now had cash-paying sponsors and only one-third were sustaining.[62] 
The CBS of the 1940s was vastly different from that of the early days; 
many of the old guard veterans had died, retired or simply left the network.[63] 
No change was greater than that in Paley himself: he had become difficult 
to work for, and had "gradually shifted from leader to despot".[63] He 
spent much of his time seeking social connections and in cultural pursuits; 
his "hope was that CBS could somehow learn to run itself".[63] His brief 
to an interior designer remodeling his townhouse included a requirement 
for closets that would accommodate 300 suits, 100 shirts and had special 
racks for a hundred neckties.[64] As Paley grew more remote, he installed 
a series of buffer executives who sequentially assumed more and more power 
at CBS: first Ed Klauber, then Paul Kesten, and finally Frank Stanton. 
Second only to Paley as the author of CBS's style and ambitions in its 
first half-century, Stanton was "a magnificent mandarin who functioned 
as company superintendent, spokesman, and image-maker".[65] He had come 
to the network in 1933 after sending copies of his Ph.D. thesis "A Critique 
Of Present Methods and a New Plan for Studying Radio Listening Behavior" 
to CBS top brass and they responded with a job offer.[66] He scored an 
early hit with his study "Memory for Advertising Copy Presented Visually 
vs. Orally," which CBS salesmen used to great effect bringing in new sponsors.[66] 
In 1946, Paley appointed Stanton as President of CBS and promoted himself 
to Chairman. Stanton's colorful, but impeccable, wardrobe – slate-blue 
pinstripe suit, ecru shirt, robin's egg blue necktie with splashes of saffron 
– made him, in the mind of one sardonic CBS vice-president, "the greatest 
argument we have for color television".[67] Despite the influx of advertisers 
and their cash, or perhaps because of them, the 1940s were not without 
bumps for the radio networks. The biggest challenge came in the form of 
the FCC's chain broadcasting investigation – the "monopoly probe", as it 
was often called.[68] Though it started in 1938, the investigation only 
gathered steam in 1940 under new-broom chairman James L. Fly.[69] By the 
time the smoke had cleared in 1943, NBC had already spun off its Blue Network, 
which became the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). CBS was also hit, 
though not as severely: Paley's brilliant 1928 affiliate contract which 
had given CBS first claim on local stations' air during sponsored time 
– the network option – came under attack as being restrictive to local 
programming.[70] The final compromise permitted the network option for 
three out of four hours during certain dayparts, but the new regulations 
had virtually no practical effect, since most all stations accepted the 
network feed, especially the sponsored hours that earned them money.[70] 
Fly's panel also forbade networks from owning artists' representation bureaus, 
so CBS sold its bureau to Music Corporation of America and it became Management 
Corporation of America.[71] On the air, the war affected almost every show. 
Variety shows wove patriotism through their comedy and music segments; 
dramas and soaps had characters join the service and go off to fight. Even 
before hostilities commenced in Europe, one of the most played songs on 
radio was Irving Berlin's "God Bless America", popularized by CBS personality 
Kate Smith.[72] Although an Office of Censorship sprang up within days 
of Pearl Harbor, censorship would be totally voluntary. A few shows submitted 
scripts for review; most did not.[73] The guidelines that the Office did 
issue banned weather reports (including announcement of sports rainouts), 
news about troop, ship or plane movements, war production and live man-on-the-street 
interviews. The ban on ad-libbing caused quizzes, game shows and amateur 
hours to wither for the duration.[73] Surprising was "the granite permanence" 
of the shows at the top of the ratings.[74] The vaudevillians and musicians 
who were hugely popular after the war were the same stars who had been 
huge in the 1930s: Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, Burns and Allen, and Edgar 
Bergen all had been on the radio almost as long as there had been network 
radio.[75] A notable exception to this was relative newcomer Arthur Godfrey 
who, as late as 1942, was still doing a local morning show in Washington, 
D.C.[76] Godfrey, who had been a cemetery-lot salesman and a cab driver, 
pioneered the style of talking directly to the listener as an individual, 
with a singular "you" rather than phrases like "Now, folks..." or "Yes, 
friends...".[77] His combined shows contributed as much as 12% of all CBS 
revenues; by 1948, he was pulling down $500,000 a year.[76] In 1947, Paley, 
still the undisputed "head talent scout" of CBS,[65] led a much-publicized 
"talent raid" on NBC. One day, while Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll 
were hard at work at NBC writing their venerable Amos and Andy show, a 
knock came on the door; it was Paley himself, with an astonishing offer: 
"Whatever you are getting now I will give you twice as much."[78] Capturing 
NBC's cornerstone show was enough of a coup, but Paley repeated in 1948 
with longtime NBC stars Edgar Bergen, Charlie McCarthy and Red Skelton, 
as well as former CBS defectors Jack Benny, radio's top-rated comedian, 
and Burns and Allen. Paley achieved this rout with a legal agreement reminiscent 
of his 1928 contract that caused some NBC radio affiliates to jump ship 
and join CBS.[78] CBS would buy the stars' names as a property, in exchange 
for a large lump sum and a salary.[79] The plan relied on the vastly different 
tax rates between income and capital gains, so not only would the stars 
enjoy more than twice their income after taxes, but CBS would preclude 
any NBC counterattack because CBS owned the performers' names.[78] As a 
result of this, Paley got in 1949 something he had sought for 20 years: 
CBS finally beat NBC in the ratings.[80] But it was not just to one-up 
rival Sarnoff that Paley led his talent raid; he, and all of radio, had 
their eye on the coming force that threw a shadow over radio throughout 
the 1940s – television. Frank Stanton, President 1946-1971; Louis G. Cowan, 
President 1957-1959; James Thomas Aubrey, President 1959-1965 In the spring 
of 1940, CBS staff engineer Peter Goldmark devised a system for color television 
that CBS management hoped would leapfrog the network over NBC and its existing 
black-and-white RCA system.[81][82] The CBS system "gave brilliant and 
stable colors", while NBC's was "crude and unstable but 'compatible'".[83] 
Ultimately, the FCC rejected the CBS system because it was incompatible 
with RCA's; that, and the fact that CBS had moved to secure many UHF, not 
VHF, television licenses, left CBS flatfooted in the early television age.[84] 
In 1946, only 6,000 television sets were in operation, most in greater 
New York City where there were already three stations; by 1949, the number 
had increased to 3 million sets, and by 1951, had risen to 12 million.[85] 
64 American cities had television stations, though most of them only had 
one.[86] Radio continued to be the backbone of the company, at least in 
the early 1950s, but it was "a strange, twilight period".[75] NBC's venerable 
Fred Allen saw his ratings plummet when he was pitted against upstart ABC's 
game show Stop The Music!; within weeks, he was dropped by longtime sponsor 
Ford Motor Company and was shortly gone from the scene.[87] Radio powerhouse 
Bob Hope's ratings plunged from a 23.8 share in 1949 to 5.4 in 1953.[88] 
By 1952, "death seemed imminent for network radio" in its familiar form;[89] 
most telling of all, the big sponsors were eager for the switch. Gradually, 
as the television network took shape, radio stars began to migrate to the 
new medium. Many programs ran on both media while making the transition. 
The radio soap opera The Guiding Light moved to television in 1952 and 
ran another 57 years; Burns & Allen, back "home" from NBC, made the move 
in 1950; Lucille Ball a year later; Our Miss Brooks in 1952 (though it 
continued simultaneously on radio for its full television life). The high-rated 
Jack Benny Program ended its radio run in 1955, and Edgar Bergen's Sunday 
night show went off the air in 1957. When CBS announced in 1956 that its 
radio operations had lost money, while the television network had made 
money,[90] it was clear where the future lay. When the soap opera Ma Perkins 
went off the air on November 25, 1960, only eight, relatively minor series 
remained. Prime time radio ended on September 30, 1962, when Yours Truly, 
Johnny Dollar and Suspense aired for the final time.[91] The retirement 
of Arthur Godfrey in April 1972 marked the end of long-form programming 
on CBS radio; programming thereafter consisted of hourly news summaries 
and news features, known in the 1970s as Dimension, and commentaries, including 
the Spectrum series that evolved into the "Point/Counterpoint" feature 
on the television network's 60 Minutes and First Line Report, a news and 
analysis feature delivered by CBS correspondents. The network also continued 
to offer traditional radio programming through its weeknightly CBS Radio 
Mystery Theater, the lone sustained holdout of dramatic programming, from 
1974 to 1982, though shorter runs were given to the General Mills Radio 
Adventure Theater and the Sears Radio Theater in the 1970s; otherwise, 
most new dramatic radio was carried on public and to some extent religious 
stations.[92] The CBS Radio Network continues to this day, offering hourly 
newscasts, including its centerpiece CBS World News Roundup in the morning 
and evening, weekend sister program CBS News Weekend Roundup, the news-related 
feature segment The Osgood File, What's In the News, a one-minute summary 
of one story, and various other segments such as commentary from Seattle 
radio personality Dave Ross, tip segments from various other sources, and 
technology coverage from CBS Interactive property CNET. CBS is the last 
of the original Big Four radio networks to continue to be owned by its 
founding company, although the CBS parent itself ceased to exist when it 
was acquired by Westinghouse Electric in 1995, CBS radio continues to be 
operated by CBS. In contrast, ABC Radio was sold to Citadel Broadcasting 
in 2007 (and is now a part of Cumulus Media) while Mutual (now defunct) 
and NBC Radio were acquired by Westwood One in the 1980s (Westwood One 
and CBS were under common ownership from 1993 to 2007; the former would 
be acquired outright by Dial Global in October 2011). CBS's involvement 
in television dates back to the opening of experimental station W2XAB in 
New York City on July 21, 1931, using the mechanical television system 
that had been more-or-less perfected in the late 1920s. Its initial broadcast 
featured New York Mayor Jimmy Walker, Kate Smith, and George Gershwin. 
The station boasted the first regular seven-day broadcasting schedule in 
American television, broadcasting 28 hours a week. Announcer-director Bill 
Schudt was the station's only paid employee; all other talent was volunteer. 
W2XAB pioneered program development including small-scale dramatic acts, 
monologues, pantomime, and the use of projection slides to simulate sets. 
Engineer Bill Lodge devised the first synchronized sound wave for a television 
station in 1932, enabling W2XAB to broadcast picture and sound on a single 
shortwave channel instead of the two previously needed. On November 8, 
1932, W2XAB broadcast the first television coverage of presidential election 
returns. The station suspended operations on February 20, 1933, as monochrome 
television transmission standards were in flux, and in the process of changing 
from a mechanical to an all-electronic system. W2XAB returned to the air 
with an all-electronic system in 1939 from a new studio complex in Grand 
Central Station and a transmitter atop the Chrysler Building, broadcasting 
on channel 2.[93] W2XAB transmitted the first color broadcast in the United 
States on August 28, 1940.[94] On June 24, 1941, W2XAB received a commercial 
construction permit and program authorization as WCBW. The station went 
on the air at 2:30 p.m. on July 1, one hour after rival WNBT (channel 1, 
formerly W2XBS and now WNBC), making it the second authorized fully commercial 
television station in the United States. The FCC issued permits to CBS 
and NBC at the same time, and intended WNBT and WCBW to sign on simultaneously 
on July 1, so no one station could claim to be the "first". During the 
World War II years, commercial television broadcasting was reduced dramatically. 
Toward the end of the war, commercial television began to ramp up again, 
with an increased level of programming evident from 1944 to 1947 on the 
three New York television stations which operated in those years (the local 
stations of NBC, CBS and DuMont). But as RCA and DuMont raced to establish 
networks and offer upgraded programming, CBS lagged, advocating an industry-wide 
shift and restart to UHF for their incompatible (with black and white) 
color system; the FCC putting an indefinite "freeze" on television licenses 
that lasted until 1952 also did not help matters. Only in 1950, when NBC 
was dominant in television and black and white transmission was widespread, 
did CBS begin to buy or build their own stations (outside of New York City) 
in Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities. Up to that point, CBS programming 
was seen on such stations as KTTV in Los Angeles, which CBS – as a bit 
of insurance and to guarantee program clearance in that market – quickly 
purchased a 50% interest in that station, partnering with the Los Angeles 
Times newspaper. CBS then sold its interest in KTTV (now the West Coast 
flagship of the Fox network) and purchased outright Los Angeles pioneer 
station KTSL in 1950, renaming it KNXT (after CBS's existing Los Angeles 
radio property, KNX), later to become KCBS-TV. In 1953, CBS bought pioneer 
television station WBKB in Chicago, which had been signed on by former 
investor Paramount Pictures (and would become a sister company to CBS again 
decades later) as a commercial station in 1946, and changed that station's 
call sign to WBBM-TV, moving the CBS affiliation away from WGN-TV. WCBS-TV 
would ultimately be the only station (as of 2013) built and signed on by 
CBS. The rest of the stations would be acquired by CBS, either in an ownership 
stake or outright purchase. In television's early years, the network bought 
Washington, D.C. affiliate WOIC (now WUSA) in a joint venture with The 
Washington Post in 1950, only to sell its stake to the Post in 1954 due 
to then-tighter FCC ownership regulations. CBS would also temporarily return 
to relying on its own UHF technology by owning WXIX in Milwaukee (now CW 
affiliate WVTV) and WHCT in Hartford, Connecticut (now Univision affiliate 
WUVN), but as UHF was not viable for broadcasting at the time (due to the 
fact that most television sets of the time were not equipped with UHF tuners), 
CBS decided to sell those stations off and affiliate with VHF stations 
WITI and WTIC-TV (now WFSB), respectively (ironically, CBS would later 
be forced back onto UHF in Milwaukee due to the affiliation agreement with 
New World Communications that resulted in WITI disaffiliating from the 
network in 1994 to join Fox; it is now affiliated with WDJT-TV in that 
market). More long-term, CBS bought stations in Philadelphia (WCAU, now 
owned by NBC) and St. Louis (KMOX-TV, now KMOV), but CBS would eventually 
sell these stations off as well; before buying KMOX-TV, CBS had attempted 
to purchase and sign on the channel 11 license in St. Louis, now KPLR-TV.[95] 
CBS did attempt to sign on a station in Pittsburgh after the "freeze" was 
lifted, as that city was then the sixth-largest market but only had one 
commercial VHF station in DuMont-owned WDTV, while the rest were either 
on UHF (the modern-day WPGH-TV and WINP-TV) or public television (WQED). 
Although the FCC turned down CBS's request to buy the channel 9 license 
in nearby Steubenville, Ohio and move it to Pittsburgh (that station, initially 
CBS affiliate WSTV-TV, is now NBC affiliate WTOV-TV), CBS did score a major 
coup when Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse Electric (a co-founder of NBC with 
RCA) bought WDTV from struggling DuMont and opted to affiliate the now-recalled 
KDKA-TV with CBS instead of NBC (like KDKA radio) due to NBC extorting 
and coercing Westinghouse to trade KYW radio and WPTZ (now KYW-TV) for 
Cleveland stations WTAM, WTAM-FM (now WMJI), and WNBK (now WKYC); the trade 
ended up being reversed in 1965 by order of the FCC and the United States 
Department of Justice after an eight-year investigation.[96] Had CBS not 
been able to affiliate with KDKA-TV, it would have affiliated with eventual 
NBC affiliate WIIC-TV (now WPXI) once it signed on in 1957 instead.[97] 
This coup would eventually lead to a much stronger relationship between 
Westinghouse and CBS decades later. The "talent raid" on NBC of the mid-1940s 
had brought over established radio stars, who became stars of CBS television 
programs as well. One reluctant CBS star refused to bring her radio show, 
My Favorite Husband, to television unless the network would recast the 
show with her real-life husband in the lead. I Love Lucy debuted in October 
1951, and was an immediate sensation, with 11 million out of a population 
of 15 million Television sets watching (73% share).[98] Paley and network 
president Frank Stanton had so little faith in the future of Lucille Ball's 
series, that they granted her wish and allowed her husband, Desi Arnaz, 
to take financial control of the comedy's production. This was the making 
of the Ball-Arnaz Desilu empire, and became the template for series production 
to this day; it also served as the template for some television conventions 
that continue to exist including the use of a multiple cameras to film 
scenes, the use of a studio audience and the airing of past episodes for 
syndication to other television outlets.[99] As television came to the 
forefront of American entertainment and information, CBS dominated television 
as it once had radio.[citation needed] In 1953, the CBS television network 
would make its first profit,[100] and would maintain dominance on television 
between 1955 and 1976 as well.[100] By the late 1950s, the network often 
controlled seven or eight of the slots on the "top ten" ratings list with 
well-respected shows like Route 66. During the Presidency of James T. Aubrey 
(1958-1965), CBS was able to balance prestigious television projects (befitting 
the Tiffany Network image), with more low culture, broad appeal programs. 
So the network had challenging fare like The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series), 
The Defenders (1961 TV series), and East Side/West Side, as well as The 
Andy Griffith Show, The Beverly Hillbillies, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., and 
Gilligan's Island. [101] This success would continue for many years, with 
CBS being bumped from first place only due to the rise of ABC in the mid-1970s. 
Perhaps because of its status as the top-rated network, during the late 
1960s and early 1970s CBS felt freer to gamble with controversial properties 
like the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour and All in the Family (and its many 
spinoffs) during this period. By the end of the 1960s, CBS was very successful 
in television ratings, but many of its shows (including The Beverly Hillbillies, 
Mayberry R.F.D., Petticoat Junction, Hee Haw and Green Acres) were appealing 
more to older and more rural audiences and less to the young, urban and 
more affluent audiences that advertisers sought to target. Fred Silverman 
(who would later head ABC, and then later NBC) made the decision to cancel 
most of those otherwise hit shows by mid-1971 in what became colloquially 
referred to as the "Rural Purge", with Green Acres cast member Pat Buttram 
remarking that the network cancelled "anything with a tree in it".[102][103] 
While the "rural" shows got the axe, new hits, like The Mary Tyler Moore 
Show, All in the Family, The Bob Newhart Show, Cannon, Barnaby Jones, Kojak 
and The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour took their place on the network's schedule 
and kept CBS at the top of the ratings through the early 1970s. The majority 
of these hits were overseen by then East Coast vice president Alan Wagner.[104] 
60 Minutes also moved to the 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time slot on Sundays in 
1976 and became the first ever prime time television news program to enter 
the Nielsen Top 10 in 1978. One of CBS's most popular shows during the 
period was M*A*S*H, a dramedy that ran for 11 seasons from 1972 to 1983 
and was based on the hit Robert Altman film; as with the film, the series 
was set during the Korean War in a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. The 2½-hour 
series finale, in its initial airing on February 28, 1983, had peak viewership 
of up to 125 million Americans (77% of all television viewership in the 
U.S. that night), which established it as the all-time most watched single 
U.S. television episode; it also held the ubiquitous distinction of having 
the largest single-night primetime viewership of any television program 
in U.S. history until it was surpassed by the Super Bowl, which have taken 
the record consistently since 2010 (through the annual championship game's 
alternating telecasts by CBS and rival networks Fox and NBC). Silverman 
also first developed his strategy of spinning new shows off from established 
hit series while at CBS, with Rhoda and Phyllis spun from The Mary Tyler 
Moore Show, Maude and The Jeffersons spun from All in the Family and Good 
Times from Maude. After Silverman's departure, CBS dropped behind ABC for 
second place in the 1976–77 season, but still rated strongly, based on 
its earlier hits and some new ones: One Day at a Time, Alice, Lou Grant, 
WKRP in Cincinnati, The Dukes of Hazzard (a suspiciously "rural" series) 
and, the biggest hit of the early 1980s, Dallas, the latter of which holds 
the record for the all-time most watched non-series finale single U.S. 
television episode - the November 21, 1980 primetime telecast of the resolution 
episode of the internationally prominent "Who Shot J.R.?" cliffhanger. 
By 1982, ABC had run out of steam, NBC was in dire straits with many failed 
programming efforts greenlighted by Silverman during his tenure as network 
president (a four-year run which began in 1978), and CBS once more nosed 
ahead, courtesy of the major success of Dallas (and its spin-off Knots 
Landing), as well as hits in Falcon Crest, Magnum, P.I., Simon & Simon 
and 60 Minutes. CBS also acquired the broadcast rights to the NCAA Men's 
Division I Basketball Tournament in 1982 (taking over for NBC), which the 
network has broadcast every March since. CBS was takeover the Dennis B. 
Kane's production company and formed new company CBS/Kane Productions International 
(CKPI). The network managed to pull out a few new hits over the next couple 
of years – namely Kate & Allie, Newhart, Cagney & Lacey, Scarecrow and 
Mrs. King, and Murder, She Wrote – however, this resurgence would be short-lived. 
CBS had become mired in debt as a result of a failed takeover effort by 
Ted Turner, which CBS chairman Thomas Wyman successfully helped to fend 
off. The network sold its St. Louis owned-and-operated station KMOX-TV, 
and allowed the purchase of a large portion of its shares (under 25 percent) 
by Loew's Inc. chairman Laurence Tisch. Consequently, collaboration between 
Paley and Tisch led to the slow dismissal of Wyman, with Tisch taking over 
as chief operating officer, and Paley returning as chairman.[105] By the 
end of the 1987–88 season, CBS had fallen to third place behind both ABC 
and NBC for the first time, and had some major rebuilding to do. In 1984, 
The Cosby Show and Miami Vice debuted on NBC and immediately garnered high 
ratings, helping to bring that network back to first place by the 1985–86 
season with a slate that included several other hits (such as Amen, Family 
Ties, Cheers, The Golden Girls, L.A. Law and 227). ABC had in turn also 
rebounded with hits such as Dynasty, Who's the Boss?, Hotel, Growing Pains, 
The Wonder Years, and Roseanne. Some of the groundwork had been laid as 
CBS fell in the ratings, with hits Simon & Simon, Falcon Crest, Murder, 
She Wrote, Kate & Allie and Newhart still on the schedule from the most 
recent resurgence, and future hits Designing Women, Murphy Brown, Jake 
and the Fatman and newsmagazine 48 Hours having debuted during the late 
1980s. The network was also still getting decent ratings for 60 Minutes, 
Dallas and Knots Landing; however, the ratings for Dallas were a far cry 
from what they were in the early 1980s. During the early 1990s, the network 
would bolster its sports lineup by obtaining the broadcast television rights 
to Major League Baseball from ABC and NBC and the Winter Olympics from 
ABC despite losing the National Basketball Association to NBC after the 
1989–90 NBA season Under network president Jeff Sagansky, the network was 
able to earn strong ratings from new shows Diagnosis: Murder, Touched by 
an Angel, Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, Walker, Texas Ranger, and a resurgent 
Jake and the Fatman during this period, and CBS was able to reclaim the 
first place crown briefly, in the 1992–93 season; however, a drawback for 
the network during this time-frame was that its programming slate skewed 
towards an older demographic than ABC, NBC or even Fox, with its relatively 
limited presence at that time; a joke even floated around that CBS was 
"the network for the living dead" during this period.[106] In 1993, the 
network made a breakthrough in establishing a successful late-night talk 
show franchise to compete with NBC's The Tonight Show when it signed David 
Letterman away from NBC after the Late Night host was passed over as Johnny 
Carson's successor on Tonight in favor of Jay Leno. Despite having success 
with Late Show with David Letterman, 1993 saw the network suffer to a time 
where television changed forever. The network lost the rights to two major 
sports leagues: the network terminated its contract with Major League Baseball 
(after losing approximately US$500 million over a four-year span), with 
the league reaching a new contract with NBC and ABC. Then on December 17 
of that year, in a move that surprised many media analysts and television 
viewers, Fox – then a fledgling network that in its then-seven years on 
the air had begun to accrue several popular programs in the Nielsen Top 
20 alongside its established counterparts – outbid CBS for the broadcast 
rights to the National Football Conference, stripping the elder network 
of National Football League game telecasts for the first time since CBS 
began broadcasting games from the pre-merger NFL in 1955; Fox bid $1.58 
billion for the NFC television rights, significantly higher than CBS's 
reported offer of $290 million to retain the contract.[107] The acquisition 
of the NFC rights, which took effect with the 1994 NFL season, and which 
led to CBS being nicknamed "Can't Broadcast Sports",[108] resulted in Fox 
striking a series of affiliation deals with longtime affiliates of each 
of the Big Three networks; CBS bore the brunt of the switches, with many 
of its existing affiliates being lured away by Fox (especially those owned 
by New World Communications, which Fox struck its largest affiliation deal 
with[109]) while most of the stations that CBS ended up affiliating with 
to replace the previous affiliates it lost to Fox were former Fox affiliates 
and independent stations, most of which had limited to no local news presence 
prior to joining CBS. The network attempted to fill the loss of NFL by 
going after the rights to the National Hockey League; however, when CBS 
countered with a bid, Fox also outbid the network for the NHL rights.[110] 
The loss of the NFL, along with an ill-fated effort to court younger viewers, 
led to a drop in CBS's ratings. One of the shows that was affected was 
the Late Show with David Letterman, which saw its viewership decline in 
large part due to the affiliation switches, at times even landing in third 
place in its timeslot behind ABC's Nightline; as a result, NBC's The Tonight 
Show with Jay Leno, which the Late Show often dominated over during the 
first two years of that show's run, became the top-rated late-night talk 
show.[111] Still, CBS was able to produce some hits during the mid-1990s, 
such as The Nanny, JAG (which moved to the network from NBC), Chicago Hope, 
Cosby, Cybill, Touched by an Angel and Everybody Loves Raymond. CBS attempted 
to court families on Fridays with the launch of a family-oriented comedy 
block, the "CBS Block Party", in the 1997–98 season (consisting of Family 
Matters, Step by Step, Meego and The Gregory Hines Show, all but the latter 
coming from Miller-Boyett Productions, which had maintained a relationship 
with ABC during the late 1980s and 1990s). The lineup failed to compete 
against ABC's "TGIF" lineup (which saw its own viewership erode that season): 
Meego and Hines were cancelled by November, while Family Matters and Step 
by Step were put on hiatus and ended their runs in the summer of 1998. 
That winter, CBS aired its last Olympic Games to date with its telecast 
of the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano; NBC, which had already held the rights 
to the Summer Olympics since 1988, took over coverage of the Winter Olympics 
beginning with the 2002 Games. The building blocks for the network's return 
to the top of the ratings were put in place in 1997, when CBS regained 
the NFL through its acquisition of the broadcast television rights to the 
American Football Conference (stripping that package from NBC after 32 
years), effective with the 1998 season.[112] The contract was struck shortly 
before the AFC's emergence as the dominant NFL conference over the NFC, 
spurred in part by the turnaround of the New England Patriots in the 2000s. 
With the help of the AFC package, CBS surpassed NBC for first place in 
the 1999–2000 season; however, it was beaten by ABC the following year. 
The network gained additional hits in the late 1990s and early 2000s with 
series such as The King of Queens, Nash Bridges, Judging Amy, Becker and 
Yes, Dear. Another turning point for CBS came in the summer of 2000 when 
it debuted the summer reality shows Survivor and Big Brother, which became 
surprise summer hits for the network. In January 2001, CBS debuted the 
second season of Survivor after its broadcast of Super Bowl XXXV and scheduled 
it on Thursdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time; it also moved the investigative 
crime drama CSI (which had debuted that fall in the Friday 9:00 p.m. time 
slot) to follow Survivor at 9:00 p.m. on Thursdays. The pairing of the 
two shows was both able to chip away at and eventually beat NBC's Thursday 
night lineup, and attract younger viewers to the network. During the 2000s, 
CBS found additional successes with a slew of police procedurals (several 
of which were produced by Jerry Bruckheimer) including Cold Case, Without 
a Trace, Criminal Minds, NCIS and The Mentalist, along with CSI spinoffs 
CSI: Miami and CSI: NY as well as sitcoms Still Standing, Two and a Half 
Men, How I Met Your Mother, The New Adventures of Old Christine, Rules 
of Engagement and The Big Bang Theory. The network's programming slate, 
buoyed largely by the success of CSI, briefly led the network to retake 
first place in the ratings from NBC in the 2002–03 season. The decade also 
saw CBS finally make ratings headway on Friday nights, a perennial weak 
spot for the network, with a focus toward drama series such as Ghost Whisperer 
and the relatively short-lived but critically acclaimed Joan of Arcadia. 
CBS became the most watched American broadcast television network once 
again in the 2005–06 season, an achievement that the network proclaimed 
in on-air promotions as being "America's Most Watched Network" (a term 
it would use again in the 2011–12 season). This lasted until the 2007–08 
season, when Fox overtook CBS for first, becoming the first non-Big Three 
network to earn the title as the most watched network overall in the United 
States; despite CBS's continued strong lineup, Fox's first-place finish 
that season was primarily due to its reliance on American Idol (the longest 
reigning #1 prime time U.S. television program from 2004 to 2011). CBS 
retook its place as the top-rated network in the 2008–09 season, where 
it has remained every season since.[113] Fox and CBS, both having ranked 
as the highest rated of the major broadcast networks during the 2000s, 
tend to nearly equal one another in the 18–34, 18–49 and 25–54 demographics, 
with either network alternating in placing first in either of these groups 
by very close margins. NCIS, which has been the flagship of CBS's Tuesday 
lineup for much of its run, became the network's highest-rated drama by 
the 2007–08 season. The 2010s saw additional hits for the network including 
drama series The Good Wife; police procedurals Person of Interest, Blue 
Bloods, Elementary, Hawaii Five-0 and NCIS spin-off NCIS: Los Angeles; 
reality series Undercover Boss; and sitcoms 2 Broke Girls and Mike & Molly. 
The Big Bang Theory, one of several sitcoms from veteran writer/producer 
Chuck Lorre, started off with modest ratings but saw its viewership skyrocket 
(earning per episode ratings of up to 17 million viewers) to become the 
top-rated network sitcom in the U.S. by the 2010–11 season, as well as 
the second most watched U.S. television program starting from the 2013-14 
season, when the series became the anchor of the network's Thursday lineup. 
Meanwhile, the Lorre-produced series it overtook for the position, Two 
and a Half Men, saw its ratings decline to respectable levels for its final 
four seasons following the 2011 firing of original star Charlie Sheen (due 
to a dispute with Lorre) and the addition of Ashton Kutcher as its primary 
lead. Until 2012, CBS ranked in second place among adults 18-49, but after 
the ratings declines Fox experienced during the 2012–13 fall season, the 
network was able to take the top spot in the demographic as well as in 
total viewership (for the fifth year in a row) by the start of 2013. At 
the end of the 2012–13 season, the tenth season of NCIS took the top spot 
among the season's most watched network programs, which gave CBS its top-rated 
show after American Idol ended its eight-year nationwide primetime lead 
(with NBC Sunday Night Football taking over the top spot from Idol the 
year before and from NCIS the year after), for the first time since the 
2002–03 season (when CSI: Crime Scene Investigation led Nielsen's seasonal 
prime time network ratings). The strength of its 2013–14 slate led to a 
surplus of series on CBS's 2014–15 schedule, with 21 series held over from 
the previous season, along with eight new series including moderate hits 
in Madam Secretary, NCIS: New Orleans and Scorpion. Also, midseason hits 
The Odd Couple reboot and CSI spinoff CSI: Cyber. The network also expanded 
its NFL coverage through a partnership with NFL Network to carry Thursday 
Night Football games during the first eight weeks of the NFL season.[114] 
Upon becoming commercial station WCBW in 1941, the pioneer CBS television 
station in New York City broadcast two daily news programs, at 2:30 and 
7:30 p.m. weekdays, anchored by Richard Hubbell. Most of the newscasts 
featured Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map 
or still photograph. When Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941, 
WCBW (which was usually off-the-air on Sundays to give the engineers a 
day off), took to the air at 8:45 p.m. that evening with an extensive special 
report. The national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between 
CBS radio and television. WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and 
experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come down to 
the station's Grand Central Station studios during the evening, and give 
information and commentary on the attack. Although WCBW's special report 
that night lasted less than 90 minutes, that special broadcast pushed the 
limits of live television in 1941 and opened up new possibilities for future 
broadcasts. As CBS wrote in a special report to the FCC, the unscheduled 
live news broadcast on December 7 "was unquestionably the most stimulating 
challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up 
to that time". Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of 
the war. In May 1942, WCBW (like almost all television stations) sharply 
cut back its live program schedule and cancelled its newscasts, as the 
station temporarily suspended studio operations, resorting exclusively 
to the occasional broadcast of films. This was primarily due to the fact 
that much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed 
to war-related technical research, and to prolong the life of the early, 
unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the lack of 
parts available during wartime. In May 1944, as the war began to turn in 
favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened its studios and resumed production of 
its newscasts, which were briefly anchored by Ned Calmer, and then by Everett 
Holles.[115] After the war, WCBW (which changed its call letters to WCBS-TV 
in 1946) introduced expanded news programs on its schedule – first anchored 
by Milo Boulton, and later by Douglas Edwards. On May 3, 1948, Edwards 
began anchoring CBS Television News, a regular 15-minute nightly newscast 
on the rudimentary CBS television network, including WCBS-TV. Airing every 
weeknight at 7:30 p.m., it was the first regularly scheduled, network television 
news program featuring an anchor (the nightly Lowell Thomas NBC radio network 
newscast was simulcast on television locally on NBC's WNBT (now WNBC) for 
a time in the early 1940s and Hubbell, Calmer, Holles and Boulton on WCBW 
in the early and mid-1940s, but these were local television broadcasts 
seen only in the New York City market). The NBC television network's offering 
at the time NBC Television Newsreel (premiering in February 1948) was simply 
film footage with voice narration to provide illustration of the stories. 
In 1949, CBS offered the first live television coverage of the proceedings 
of the United Nations General Assembly. This journalistic tour-de-force 
was under the direction of Edmund A. Chester, who was appointed to the 
post of Director for News, Special Events and Sports at CBS Television 
in 1948. In 1950, the nightly newscast was retitled Douglas Edwards with 
the News, and the following year, it became the first news program to be 
broadcast on both coasts, thanks to a new coaxial cable connection, prompting 
Edwards to use the greeting, "Good evening everyone, coast to coast" to 
begin each edition. The broadcast was renamed the CBS Evening News when 
Walter Cronkite replaced Edwards in 1962.[116] Edwards remained with CBS 
News as anchor/reporter for various daytime television and radio news broadcasts 
until his retirement on April 1, 1988. Although CBS Television was the 
first with a working color television system, the network lost out to RCA 
in 1953, due in part because the CBS color system was incompatible with 
existing black-and-white sets. Although RCA – then-parent company of NBC 
– made its color system available to CBS, the network was not interested 
in boosting RCA's profits and televised only a few specials in color for 
the rest of the decade. The specials included the Ford Star Jubilee programs 
(which included the first telecast ever of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)'s 
1939 film classic The Wizard of Oz) as well as the 1957 telecast of Rodgers 
and Hammerstein's Cinderella; Cole Porter's musical version of Aladdin; 
and Playhouse 90's only color broadcast, the 1958 production of The Nutcracker, 
featuring choreography by George Balanchine. The Nutcracker telecast was 
based on the famous production staged annually since 1954 in New York, 
and performed by the New York City Ballet. CBS would later show two other 
versions of the ballet, a semi-forgotten one-hour German-American version 
hosted by Eddie Albert, shown annually for three years beginning in 1965, 
and the well-loved Mikhail Baryshnikov production from 1977 to 1981 (this 
production later moved to PBS). Beginning in 1959, The Wizard of Oz, now 
telecast by CBS as a family special in its own right (after the cancellation 
of Ford Star Jubilee), became an annual tradition on color television. 
However, it was the success of NBC's 1955 telecast of the musical Peter 
Pan, starring Mary Martin, the most watched television special of its time, 
that inspired CBS to telecast The Wizard of Oz, Cinderella and Aladdin. 
From 1960 to 1965, the CBS television network limited its color broadcasts 
to only a few special presentations such as The Wizard of Oz, and only 
then if the sponsor would pay for it. Red Skelton was the first CBS host 
to telecast his weekly programs in color, using a converted movie studio, 
in the early 1960s; he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the network to 
use his facility for other programs, and was then forced to sell it. Color 
was being pushed hard by rival NBC; even ABC had several color programs, 
beginning in the fall of 1962; however, those were limited because of financial 
and technical issues that the network was going through at the time. One 
particularly notable television special aired by CBS during this era was 
the Charles Collingwood-hosted tour of the White House with First Lady 
Jackie Kennedy, which was broadcast in black-and-white. Beginning in 1963, 
at least one CBS show, The Lucy Show, began filming in color at the insistence 
of its star and producer Lucille Ball; she realized that color episodes 
would command more money when they were eventually sold into syndication, 
but even it was broadcast in black and white through the end of the 1964–65 
season. This would all change by the mid-1960s, when market pressure forced 
CBS Television to begin adding color programs to its regular schedule for 
the 1965–66 season and complete the transition to the format during the 
1966–67 season. By the fall of 1967, nearly all of CBS's television programs 
were in color, as was the case with those aired by NBC and ABC. A notable 
exception was The Twentieth Century, which consisted mostly of newsreel 
archival footage, though even this program used at least some color footage 
by the late 1960s. In 1965, CBS telecast a new color version of Rodgers 
and Hammerstein's Cinderella. This version, starring Lesley Ann Warren 
and Stuart Damon in the roles formerly played by Julie Andrews and Jon 
Cypher, was shot on videotape rather than being telecast live, and would 
become an annual tradition on the network for the next nine years. In 1967, 
NBC outbid CBS for the rights to the annual telecast of The Wizard of Oz, 
with the film moving to NBC beginning the following year. However, the 
network quickly realized their mistake in allowing what was then one of 
its prime ratings winners to be acquired by another network, and by 1976, 
CBS reacquired the television rights to the film, with the network continuing 
to broadcast it through the end of 1997. CBS aired The Wizard of Oz twice 
in 1991, in March and again the night before Thanksgiving. Thereafter, 
it was broadcast on the night before Thanksgiving. By the end of the 1960s, 
CBS was broadcasting virtually its entire programming lineup in color. 
Prior to the 1960s, CBS's acquisitions had been related mainly to its broadcasting 
business; these had included the purchases of American Record Corporation 
and Hytron. During the 1950s and early 1960s, CBS operated a CBS-Columbia 
division, manufacturing phonographs, radios and television sets; however, 
the company had problems with product quality, which partly hindered any 
possibility of success in that field. In 1955, CBS purchased animation 
studio Terrytoons Inc. from its founder Paul Terry, not only acquiring 
Terry's backlog of cartoons for the network but continuing the studio's 
ongoing contract to provide theatrical cartoons for 20th Century Fox well 
into the 1960s. During the 1960s, CBS began an effort to diversify its 
portfolio, and looked for suitable investments. In 1965, it acquired electric 
guitar maker Fender from Leo Fender, who agreed to sell his company due 
to health problems. The purchase also included that of Rhodes electric 
pianos, which had already been acquired by Fender. This and other acquisitions 
led to a restructuring of the corporation into various operating groups 
and divisions; the quality of the products manufactured by these acquired 
companies fell dramatically, resulting in the terms "pre-CBS" to refer 
to products of higher, sought after quality and "CBS" for products of mass-produced 
lower quality. In other diversification attempts, CBS would buy (and later 
sell) a varied number of other properties including sports teams (especially 
the New York Yankees baseball club), book and magazine publishers (Fawcett 
Publications including Woman's Day, and Holt, Rinehart and Winston), map-makers 
and toy manufacturers (Gabriel Toys, Child Guidance, Wonder Products, Gym 
Dandy and Ideal). CBS developed an early home video system called EVR (Electronic 
Video Recording), but was never able to launch it successfully. As William 
Paley aged, he tried to find the one person who could follow in his footsteps. 
However, numerous successors-in-waiting came and went. By the mid-1980s, 
investor Laurence Tisch had begun to acquire substantial holdings in CBS. 
Eventually he gained Paley's confidence, and with his support, took control 
of CBS in 1986. Tisch's primary interest was turning profits. When CBS 
faltered, underperforming units were given the axe. Among the first properties 
to be jettisoned was the Columbia Records group, which had been part of 
the company since 1938. In 1986, Tisch also shut down the CBS Technology 
Center in Stamford, which had started in New York City in the 1930s as 
CBS Laboratories and evolved to be the company's technology research and 
development unit. Columbia Records was a record label acquired by CBS in 
1938. In 1962, CBS launched CBS Records International to market Columbia 
recordings outside of North America, where the Columbia name was controlled 
by other entities. In 1966, CBS Records was made a separate subsidiary 
of Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.[117] CBS sold the CBS Records Group 
to Sony on November 17, 1987, initiating the Japanese buying spree of U.S. 
companies (such as MCA, Pebble Beach Co., Rockefeller Center and the Empire 
State Building) that continued into the 1990s. The record label company 
was rechristened Sony Music Entertainment in 1991, as Sony had a short 
term license on the CBS name. Sony purchased from EMI its rights to the 
Columbia Records name outside the U.S., Canada, Spain and Japan. Sony now 
uses Columbia Records as a label name in all countries except Japan, where 
Sony Records remains their flagship label. Sony acquired the Spanish rights 
when Sony Music merged with Bertelsmann subsidiary BMG in 2004 as Sony 
BMG, co-owned by Sony and Bertelsmann; Sony bought out BMG's share in 2008. 
CBS Corporation formed a new record label named CBS Records in 2006. CBS 
entered the publishing business in 1967 by acquiring Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 
a publisher of trade books and textbooks as well as the magazine Field 
& Stream. The following year, CBS acquired the medical publishing company 
Saunders and merged it into Holt, Rinehart & Winston. In 1971, CBS acquired 
Bond/Parkhurst, the publisher of Road & Track and Cycle World. CBS greatly 
expanded its magazine business by purchasing Fawcett Publications in 1974, 
bringing in such magazines as Woman's Day. In 1984, it acquired the majority 
of the publications owned by Ziff Davis. CBS sold its book publishing businesses 
in 1985. The educational publishing division, which retained the Holt, 
Rinehart & Winston name, was sold to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich; the trade 
book division, renamed Henry Holt and Company, was sold to the West German 
publisher Holtzbrinck. CBS exited the magazine business through the sale 
of the unit to its executive Peter Diamandis, who later sold the magazines 
to Hachette Filipacchi Médias in 1988, forming Hachette Filipacchi Media 
U.S. Forming the CBS Musical Instruments division, the company also acquired 
Fender (1965–1983), Electro-Music Inc. (Leslie speakers) (1965–1980), Rogers 
Drums (1966–1983), Steinway pianos (1972–), Gemeinhardt flutes, Lyon & 
Healy harps (in the late 1970s), Rodgers (institutional) organs, and Gulbransen 
home organs. The company's last musical instrument manufacturer purchase 
was its 1981 acquisition of the assets of then-bankrupt ARP Instruments, 
a developer of electronic synthesizers. Between 1965 and 1985, the quality 
of Fender guitars and amplifiers declined significantly. Encouraged by 
outraged Fender fans, CBS Musical Instruments division executives executed 
a leveraged buyout in 1985 and created Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. 
At the same time, CBS divested itself of Rodgers, along with Steinway and 
Gemeinhardt, all of which were purchased by Steinway Musical Properties. 
The other musical instrument manufacturing properties were also liquidated. 
CBS made a brief, unsuccessful move into film production in the late 1960s, 
through the creation of Cinema Center Films. This profit-free unit was 
shut down in 1972; the distribution rights to the Cinema Center library 
today rest with Paramount Pictures for home video (via CBS Home Entertainment) 
and theatrical release, and with CBS Television Distribution for television 
syndication (most other ancillary rights remain with CBS). The studio released 
such films as the 1969 Steve McQueen drama The Reivers and the 1970 Albert 
Finney musical Scrooge. Ten years after Cinema Center ceased operations, 
in 1982, CBS made another attempt at a venture in the film industry, in 
a joint venture with Columbia Pictures and HBO called TriStar Pictures. 
Despite releasing such box office successes as The Natural, Places in the 
Heart and Rambo: First Blood Part II, CBS felt the studio was not making 
a profit and in 1985, sold its stake in TriStar to Columbia Pictures' then-corporate 
parent The Coca-Cola Company.[118] In 2007, CBS Corporation announced its 
intent to get back into the feature film business, slowly launching CBS 
Films and hiring key executives in the spring of 2008 to start up the new 
venture. The CBS Films name was actually used previously in 1953, when 
it was briefly used for CBS's distributor of off-network and first-run 
syndicated programming to local television stations in the United States 
and internationally. CBS entered into the home video market, when it partnered 
with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to form MGM/CBS Home Video in 1978; the joint 
venture was dissolved by 1982. CBS later partnered with another studio, 
20th Century Fox, to form CBS/Fox Video. CBS's duty was to release some 
of the film title released by TriStar Pictures under the CBS/Fox Video 
label. CBS entered the video game market briefly, through its acquisition 
of Gabriel Toys (renamed CBS Toys), publishing several arcade adaptations 
and original titles under the name "CBS Electronics", for the Atari 2600, 
and other consoles and computers; it also produced one of the first karaoke 
recording/players. CBS Electronics also distributed all Coleco-related 
video game products in Canada, including the ColecoVision. CBS later sold 
Gabriel Toys to View-Master, which eventually ended up as part of Mattel. 
By the early 1990s, profits had fallen as a result of competition from 
cable television and video rentals, and in consequence of the high cost 
of programming. About 20 former CBS affiliates switched to the rapidly 
rising Fox network in the mid-1990s, while many television markets across 
the United States (KDFX in Palm Springs, California and KECY in Yuma, Arizona 
were reportedly the first to switch in August 1994) lost their CBS affiliate 
for a while. The network's ratings were acceptable, but it struggled with 
an image of stodginess. Laurence Tisch lost interest and sought a new buyer. 
In the mid-1990s, CBS formed an affiliate relationship with Westinghouse 
Electric Corporation as a partial result of losing many longtime affiliates 
owned by New World Communications through an affiliation agreement with 
Fox that New World signed in May 1994. The New World deal resulted in CBS 
affiliating with UHF stations in Detroit and Cleveland – former Fox affiliate 
WOIO and low-rated ethnic independent WGPR-TV (now WWJ-TV), the latter 
of which was purchased by the network – after a failed attempt to woo the 
respective longtime ABC affiliates in those markets, WXYZ-TV and WEWS-TV 
(the latter of which had previously been a CBS affiliate from 1947 to 1955) 
to respectively replace departing affiliates WJBK and WJW-TV, a situation 
that the E. W. Scripps Company actually used as leverage to sign a group-wide 
affiliation deal with ABC that kept the network on WXYZ and WEWS.[119][120] 
Included in the Scripps deal was Baltimore NBC affiliate WMAR-TV (which 
had been affiliated with CBS from 1948 to 1981), displacing longtime ABC 
affiliate WJZ-TV, despite the fact that Westinghouse-owned WJZ-TV had long 
been the Baltimore market's dominant station while WMAR-TV had long been 
in a distant third and even nearly lost its license in 1991.[121] This 
did not sit well with Westinghouse, who even before the New World deal 
was already seeking a group-wide affiliation deal of its own, but accelerated 
the process after the Scripps-ABC agreement.[122] In 1994, Westinghouse 
signed a long-term deal to affiliate all five of its television stations 
with CBS.[123][124] Of the other four stations, two of the stations (KPIX 
in San Francisco and KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh) were already longtime affiliates 
of the network, while two others (KYW-TV in Philadelphia and WBZ-TV in 
Boston) were longtime affiliates of NBC. The network decided to sell off 
existing O&O in Philadelphia, WCAU, which would eventually be purchased 
by NBC, despite at the time being much higher rated locally than KYW-TV. 
While WJZ-TV and WBZ-TV switched to CBS in January 1995, the swap was delayed 
in Philadelphia when CBS discovered that an outright sale of channel 10 
would have forced it to pay massive taxes on the proceeds from the deal.[125] 
To solve this problem, CBS, NBC and Group W entered into a complex ownership/affiliation 
deal in the summer of 1995. NBC traded KCNC-TV in Denver and KUTV in Salt 
Lake City to CBS in return for WCAU, which for legal reasons would be an 
even trade. CBS then traded controlling interest in KCNC and KUTV to Group 
W in return for a minority stake in KYW-TV. As compensation for the loss 
of stations, NBC and CBS traded transmitter facilities in Miami, with NBC-owned 
WTVJ moving to channel 6 and CBS-owned WCIX moving to channel 4 as WFOR-TV.[126] 
On August 1, 1995, Westinghouse Electric Company acquired CBS outright 
for $5.4 billion.[127] As one of the major broadcasting group owners of 
commercial radio and television stations (as Group W) since 1920, Westinghouse 
sought to transition from a station operator into a major media company 
with its purchase of CBS. Except for KUTV (which CBS sold to Four Points 
Media Group in 2007, and is now owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group), 
all of the stations involved in the initial Westinghouse deal as well as 
WWJ-TV remain owned-and-operated stations of the network to this day. Westinghouse's 
acquisition of CBS had the effect of suddenly turning the combined company's 
all-news radio stations in New York City (WCBS and WINS) and Los Angeles 
(KNX and KFWB) from bitter rivals to sister stations. While KFWB switched 
from all-news to news/talk in 2009, WINS and WCBS remain all-news stations, 
with WINS (which pioneered the all-news format in 1965) concentrating its 
news coverage on the five core New York City boroughs and WCBS, with its 
much more powerful signal, covering the surrounding tri-state metropolitan 
area. In Chicago, the situation started out with Westinghouse's WMAQ beginning 
to feature long-form stories and discussions about the news, along with 
a business news focus to differentiate from WBBM until 2000, when an FCC 
ownership situation had CBS Radio deciding to move its all sports WSCR 
to WMAQ's signal to sell off the former WSCR facility. In 1997, Westinghouse 
acquired the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, owner of more than 150 
radio stations, for $4.9 billion. Also that year, Westinghouse created 
CBS Cable, a division formed through the acquisition of two existing cable 
channels from the Gaylord Entertainment Company (The Nashville Network 
(now Spike) and Country Music Television) and starting a new one (CBS Eye 
on People, which was later sold to Discovery Communications). CBS also 
owned the Spanish-language news network CBS Telenoticias. Following the 
Infinity purchase, operation and sales responsibilities for the CBS Radio 
Network was handed to Infinity, which turned management over to Westwood 
One, a major radio program syndicator that Infinity managed which had previously 
purchased the Mutual Broadcasting System, NBC's radio networks and the 
rights to use the "NBC Radio Networks" name. For a time, CBS Radio, NBC 
Radio Networks and CNN's radio news services were all under the Westwood 
One umbrella. As of 2008[update], Westwood One continues to distribute 
CBS radio programming, but as a self-managed company that put itself up 
for sale and found a buyer for a significant amount of its stock. Also 
in 1997, Westinghouse changed its name to CBS Corporation, and corporate 
headquarters were moved from Pittsburgh to New York City. To underline 
the change in emphasis, all non-entertainment assets were put up for sale. 
Another 90 radio stations were added to Infinity's portfolio in 1998 with 
the acquisition of American Radio Systems Corporation for $2.6 billion. 
In 1999, CBS paid $2.5 billion to acquire King World Productions, a television 
syndication company whose programs included The Oprah Winfrey Show, Jeopardy! 
and Wheel of Fortune. By the end of 1999, all pre-CBS elements of Westinghouse's 
industrial past (beyond retaining rights to the name for brand licensing 
purposes) were gone. By the 1990s, CBS had become a broadcasting giant; 
however, in 1999, entertainment conglomerate Viacom – a company that ironically 
was created by CBS in 1952 as CBS Films, Inc. to syndicate old CBS series 
and was spun off under the Viacom name in 1971 – announced it was taking 
over its former parent in a deal valued at $37 billion. Following completion 
of this effort in 2000, Viacom became the second-largest entertainment 
company in the world. Coincidentally, Viacom had purchased Paramount Pictures, 
which had once invested in CBS, in 1994. Having assembled all the elements 
of a communications empire, Viacom found that the promised synergy was 
not there; in 2005, Viacom announced that it would split the company into 
two separately operated but commonly controlled entities.[128] CBS became 
the center of a new company, CBS Corporation. The legal successor to the 
old Viacom, the company's properties included the broadcasting entities 
(CBS and UPN, the latter of which later merged with Time Warner-owned The 
WB to form The CW; the Viacom Television Stations Group, which became CBS 
Television Stations; and CBS Radio); Paramount Television's production 
operations (now known as CBS Television Studios); Viacom Outdoor advertising 
(renamed CBS Outdoor); Showtime Networks; Simon & Schuster; and Paramount 
Parks, which the company sold in May 2006. The other company, which retained 
the Viacom name, kept Paramount Pictures, assorted MTV Networks, BET Networks, 
and Famous Music (the latter of which was sold to Sony/ATV Music Publishing 
in May 2007). As a result of the Viacom/CBS corporate split, as well as 
other acquisitions over recent years, CBS (under the moniker CBS Studios) 
owns a massive film and television library spanning nine decades; these 
include not acquired material from Viacom and CBS in-house productions 
and network programs, as well as programs originally aired on competing 
networks. Shows and other material in this library include among others, 
I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners, The Twilight Zone, Hawaii Five-O (both the 
original and current remake), Gunsmoke, The Fugitive, The Love Boat, Little 
House on the Prairie (U.S. television rights only), Cheers, Becker, Family 
Ties, Happy Days and its spin-offs, The Brady Bunch, Star Trek, The Young 
Indiana Jones Chronicles (distribution rights on behalf of copyright holder 
Lucasfilm), Evening Shade, Duckman, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and 
its spin-offs, the CBS theatrical library (including My Fair Lady and Scrooge), 
and the entire Terrytoons library from 1921 forward. Both CBS Corporation 
and the new Viacom are owned by National Amusements, the Sumner Redstone-owned 
company that controlled the original Viacom prior to the split. As such, 
Paramount Home Media Distribution (formerly Paramount Home Entertainment) 
continues to handle DVD and Blu-ray distribution for the CBS library. As 
of 2013[update], CBS provides 87½ hours of regularly scheduled network 
programming each week. The network provides 22 hours of prime time programming 
to affiliated stations Monday through Saturdays from 8:00–11:00 p.m. Eastern 
and Pacific (7:00–10:00 p.m. in all other time zones) and Sundays from 
7:00–11:00 p.m. (6:00–10:00 p.m. elsewhere). Daytime programming is also 
provided from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. weekdays (with a half-hour break 
at 12:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific for CBS stations to air local newscasts or 
syndicated programs; usage of the 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. hours for network 
programming vary depending on the affiliate and on time zone) featuring 
the game shows The Price Is Right and Let's Make a Deal, soap operas The 
Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful, and talk show The 
Talk. CBS News programming includes CBS This Morning from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. 
weekdays and Saturdays; nightly editions of CBS Evening News (whose weekend 
editions are occasionally subject to abbreviation or preemption due to 
sports telecasts overrunning into the program's timeslot), the Sunday political 
talk show Face the Nation, early morning news programs Up to the Minute 
and CBS Morning News and the newsmagazines 60 Minutes, CBS News Sunday 
Morning and 48 Hours. Late nights feature the weeknight talk shows The 
Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Late Late Show with James Corden. 
Sports programming is also provided weekend afternoons at any time between 
12:00 and 7:00 p.m. (9:00 a.m.-4:00 p.m. Pacific Time). Due to the unpredictable 
length of sporting events, CBS will occasionally delay scheduled primetime 
programs to allow the programs to air in their entirety (this is particularly 
prevalent on Sunday evenings during the NFL season, on weeks when CBS is 
scheduled to broadcast a late afternoon game). In addition to rights to 
sports events from the NFL, PGA and NCAA among other major sports organizations, 
CBS broadcasts the CBS Sports Spectacular, a sports anthology series which 
fills certain weekend afternoon time slots prior to – or in some cases, 
in lieu of – a major sporting event. CBS's daytime schedule (the longest 
among the major networks, in terms of total time, at 4½ hours) is the home 
of the long-running game show The Price Is Right, which began production 
in 1972 and is the longest continuously running daytime game show on network 
television. After being hosted by Bob Barker for 35 years, the show has 
been hosted since 2007 by actor/comedian Drew Carey. The network is also 
home to the current incarnation of Let's Make a Deal, hosted by singer/comedian 
Wayne Brady, which originated in 1964 on NBC and was revived by CBS in 
2009 (after a 19-year absence as a regular series). As of 2015[update], 
CBS is the only commercial broadcast network that continues to broadcast 
daytime game shows. Notable game shows that once aired as part of the network's 
daytime lineup include Match Game, Tattletales, The $10/25,000 Pyramid, 
Press Your Luck, Card Sharks, Family Feud and Wheel of Fortune. Past game 
shows that have had both daytime and prime time runs on the network include 
Beat the Clock, To Tell the Truth and Password. Two long-running prime 
time-only games were the panel shows What's My Line? and I've Got a Secret. 
The network is also home to The Talk, a panel talk show similar in format 
to ABC's The View, which debuted in October 2010 (as of 2012[update], the 
program is hosted by moderator Julie Chen, series creator/executive producer 
Sara Gilbert, Sharon Osbourne, Aisha Tyler and Sheryl Underwood). As of 
September 2013[update], CBS Daytime airs two daytime soap operas each weekday: 
the hour-long series The Young and the Restless and half-hour series The 
Bold and the Beautiful. CBS has aired the most soap operas out of the Big 
Three networks, carrying 3½ hours of soaps on its daytime lineup from 1982 
to 2009. After Guiding Light ended in September 2009, ABC overtook CBS 
as the network with the most daily hours dedicated to soap operas; however, 
CBS reclaimed this distinction in January 2012, following the conclusion 
of two of ABC's three remaining soap operas, All My Children and One Life 
to Live, which were cancelled the year before. Other than Guiding Light, 
notable daytime soap operas that once aired on CBS include As the World 
Turns, Love of Life, Search for Tomorrow, The Secret Storm, The Edge of 
Night and Capitol. CBS broadcast the live-action series Captain Kangaroo 
on weekday mornings from 1955 to 1982, and on Saturdays through 1984. From 
1971 to 1986, CBS News produced a series of one-minute segments titled 
In the News, which aired between other Saturday morning programs. Otherwise, 
in regards to children's programming, CBS has aired mostly animated series 
for children, such as reruns of Mighty Mouse, Bugs Bunny and Tom and Jerry 
cartoons, as well as the original version of Scooby-Doo, Fat Albert and 
the Cosby Kids, Jim Henson's Muppet Babies, Garfield and Friends, and the 
1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In 1997, CBS premiered Wheel 2000 (a 
children's version of the syndicated game show Wheel of Fortune), which 
aired simultaneously on the Game Show Network. In September 1998, CBS began 
contracting the time period out to other companies to provide programming 
and material for its Saturday morning schedule. The first of these outsourced 
blocks was the CBS Kidshow, which ran until 2000 and featured programming 
from Canadian studio Nelvana[129] (such as Anatole, Mythic Warriors, Rescue 
Heroes and Flying Rhino Junior High).[130] After its agreement with Nelvana 
ended, the network then entered into a deal with Nickelodeon (which by 
the time of the deal was a corporate sister to CBS, through the latter's 
then parent company Viacom, as a result of its 2000 merger with CBS Corporation) 
to air programming from its Nick Jr. block beginning in September 2000, 
under the banner Nick Jr. on CBS.[129] From 2002 to 2005, live-action and 
animated Nickelodeon series aimed at older children also aired as part 
of the block, under the sub-brand Nick on CBS. Following the Viacom-CBS 
split that resulted in the network deciding to discontinue the Nickelodeon 
content deal, in March 2006, CBS entered into a three-year agreement with 
DIC Entertainment (which was acquired later that year by the Cookie Jar 
Group, which assumed the rights to the deal) to program the Saturday morning 
time slot,[131][132] as part of a deal which included distribution of select 
tape delayed Formula One auto races.[133][134] The KOL Secret Slumber Party 
on CBS replaced Nick Jr. on CBS that September, with the inaugural lineup 
featuring two new first-run live-action programs, one animated series that 
originally aired in syndication in 2005 and three shows produced prior 
to 2006. In mid-2007, KOL (the children's service of AOL) withdrew sponsorship 
from CBS's Saturday morning block, which was subsequently renamed KEWLopolis. 
Complimenting CBS's 2007 lineup was Care Bears, Strawberry Shortcake and 
Sushi Pack. On February 24, 2009, it was announced that CBS renewed its 
contract with Cookie Jar for another three seasons, running through 2012.[135][136] 
On September 19, 2009, KEWLopolis was renamed Cookie Jar TV.[137] On July 
24, 2013, CBS entered into an agreement with Litton Entertainment (which 
already programmed a syndicated Saturday morning block exclusive to ABC 
stations and would later produce a block for CBS sister network The CW 
that debuted the following year) to launch a new Saturday morning block 
featuring live-action reality-based lifestyle, wildlife and sports series. 
The Litton-produced "CBS Dream Team" block, which is aimed at teenagers 
13 to 16 years old, debuted on September 28, 2013, replacing Cookie Jar 
TV.[138] CBS was the original broadcast network home of the animated primetime 
holiday specials based on the Peanuts comic strip, beginning with A Charlie 
Brown Christmas in 1965. Over 30 holiday Peanuts specials (each for a specific 
holiday such as Halloween) were broadcast on CBS from that time until 2000, 
when the broadcast rights were acquired by ABC. CBS also aired several 
primetime animated specials based on the works of Dr. Seuss (Theodor Geisel), 
beginning with How the Grinch Stole Christmas in 1966, as well as several 
specials based on the Garfield comic strip during the 1980s (which led 
to Garfield getting his own Saturday morning cartoon on the network, Garfield 
and Friends, which ran from 1988 to 1995). Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, 
produced in stop motion by the Rankin/Bass studio, has been another annual 
holiday staple of CBS since 1972; however, that special originated on NBC 
in 1964. As of 2011, Rudolph and Frosty the Snowman are the only two pre-1990 
animated specials remaining on CBS; the broadcast rights to the Charlie 
Brown specials and The Grinch are now held by ABC, while that network's 
cable sister ABC Family owns the rights to the Garfield specials. All of 
these animated specials, from 1973 to 1990, began with a fondly remembered 
seven-second animated opening sequence, in which the words "A CBS Special 
Presentation" were displayed in colorful lettering (the ITC Avant Garde 
typeface, widely used in the 1970s, was used for the title logo). The word 
"SPECIAL", in all caps and repeated multiple times in multiple colors, 
slowly zoomed out from the frame in a spinning counterclockwise motion 
against a black background, and rapidly zoomed back into frame as a single 
word, in white, at the end; the sequence was accompanied by a jazzy though 
majestic up-tempo fanfare with dramatic horns and percussion (which was 
edited incidental music from the CBS crime drama Hawaii Five-O, titled 
"Call to Danger" on the Capitol Records soundtrack LP). This opening sequence 
appeared immediately before all CBS specials of the period (such as the 
Miss USA pageants and the annual presentation of the Kennedy Center Honors), 
in addition to animated specials (this opening was presumably designed 
by, or under the supervision of, longtime CBS creative director Lou Dorfsman, 
who oversaw print and on-air graphics for CBS for nearly 30 years, replacing 
William Golden, who died in 1959). CBS was also responsible for airing 
the series of Young People's Concerts conducted by Leonard Bernstein. Telecast 
every few months between 1958 and 1972, first in black-and-white and then 
broadcast in color beginning in 1966, these programs introduced millions 
of children to classical music through the eloquent commentaries by Maestro 
Bernstein. The specials were nominated for several Emmy Awards, and were 
among the first programs ever broadcast from Lincoln Center for the Performing 
Arts. Over the years, CBS has broadcast three different productions of 
Tchaikovsky's famous ballet The Nutcracker – two live telecasts of the 
George Balanchine New York City Ballet production in 1957 and 1958 respectively, 
a little-known German-American filmed production in 1965 (which was subsequently 
repeated three times and starred Edward Villella, Patricia McBride and 
Melissa Hayden), and beginning in 1977, the Mikhail Baryshnikov staging 
of the ballet, starring the Russian dancer along with Gelsey Kirkland – 
a version that would become a television classic, and remains so today 
(the broadcast of this production later moved to PBS). In April 1986, CBS 
presented a slightly abbreviated version of Horowitz in Moscow, a live 
piano recital by legendary pianist Vladimir Horowitz, which marked Horowitz's 
return to Russia after more than 60 years. The recital was televised as 
an episode of CBS News Sunday Morning (televised at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time 
in the U.S., as the recital was performed simultaneously at 4:00 p.m. in 
Russia). It was so successful that CBS repeated it a mere two months later 
by popular demand, this time on videotape, rather than live. In later years, 
the program was shown as a standalone special on PBS; the current DVD of 
the telecast omits the commentary by Charles Kuralt, but includes additional 
selections not heard on the CBS telecast. In 1986, CBS telecast Carnegie 
Hall: The Grand Reopening in primetime, in what was now a rare move for 
a commercial broadcast network, since most primetime classical music specials 
were relegated to PBS and A&E by this time. The program was a concert commemorating 
the re-opening of Carnegie Hall after its complete renovation. It featured, 
along with luminaries such as Leonard Bernstein, popular music artists 
such as Frank Sinatra. In order to compete with NBC, which produced the 
now-legendary televised version of the Mary Martin Broadway production 
of Peter Pan, CBS responded with a musical production of Cinderella, with 
music composed by Richard Rodgers and a book and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 
II. Based upon the classic French fairy tale of the same title, it is the 
only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ever to have been written for television. 
It was originally broadcast live in color on CBS on March 31, 1957 as a 
vehicle for Julie Andrews, who played the title role; that broadcast was 
seen by over 100 million people. It was subsequently remade by CBS in 1965, 
with Lesley Ann Warren, Stuart Damon, Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon 
among its stars; the remake also included a new song, "Loneliness of Evening", 
which was originally composed in 1949 for South Pacific, but was not performed 
in that musical.[139][140] This version was rebroadcast several times on 
CBS into the early 1970s, and is occasionally broadcast on various cable 
networks to this day; both versions are available on DVD. CBS was also 
the original broadcast home for the primetime specials produced by the 
National Geographic Society. The Geographic series in the U.S. started 
on CBS in 1964, before moving to ABC in 1973 (the specials subsequently 
moved to PBS – under the production of Pittsburgh member station WQED – 
in 1975 and NBC in 1995, before returning to PBS in 2000). The specials 
have featured stories on many scientific figures such as Louis Leakey, 
Jacques Cousteau and Jane Goodall, that not only featured their work but 
helped make them internationally known and accessible to millions. A majority 
of the specials were narrated by various actors, notably Alexander Scourby 
during the CBS run. The success of the specials led in part to the creation 
of the National Geographic Channel, a cable channel launched in January 
2001 as a joint venture between the National Geographic Society and Fox 
Cable Networks. The specials' distinctive theme music, by Elmer Bernstein, 
was also adopted by the National Geographic Channel. From 1949 to 2002, 
the Pillsbury Bake-Off, an annual national cooking contest, was broadcast 
on CBS as a special. Hosts for the broadcast included Arthur Godfrey, Art 
Linkletter, Bob Barker, Gary Collins, Willard Scott (although under contract 
with CBS's rival NBC) and Alex Trebek. The Miss USA beauty pageant aired 
on CBS from 1963 to 2002; during a large portion of that period, the telecast 
was often emceed by the host of one of the network's game shows. John Charles 
Daly hosted the show from 1963 to 1966, succeeded by Bob Barker from 1967 
to 1987 (at which point Barker, an animal rights activist who eventually 
convinced producers of The Price Is Right to cease offering fur coats as 
prizes on the program, quit in a dispute over their use), Alan Thicke in 
1988, Dick Clark from 1989 to 1993, and Bob Goen from 1994 to 1996. The 
pageant's highest viewership was recorded in the early 1980s, when it regularly 
topped the Nielsen ratings on the week of its broadcast.[141][142][143] 
Viewership dropped sharply throughout the 1990s and 2000s, from an estimated 
viewership of 20 million to an average of 7 million from 2000 to 2001.[144] 
In 2002, Donald Trump (owner of the Miss USA pageant's governing body, 
the Miss Universe Organization) brokered a new deal with NBC, giving it 
half-ownership of the Miss USA, Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA pageants 
and moving them to that network as part of an initial five-year contract,[145] 
which began in 2003 and ended in 2015 after 12 years amid Trump's controversial 
remarks about Mexican immigrants during the launch of his 2016 campaign 
for the Republican Presidential nomination.[146] On June 1, 1977, it was 
announced that Elvis Presley had signed a deal with CBS to appear in a 
new television special. Under the agreement, CBS would videotape Presley's 
concerts during the summer of 1977; the special was filmed during Presley's 
final tour at stops in Omaha, Nebraska (on June 19) and Rapid City, South 
Dakota (on June 21 of that year). CBS aired the special, Elvis in Concert, 
on October 3, 1977,[147] nearly two months after Presley's death in his 
Graceland mansion on August 16. As of March 2015[update], CBS has 16 owned-and-operated 
stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 222 additional 
television stations encompassing 49 states, the District of Columbia, two 
U.S. possessions, Bermuda and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.[148][149] 
The network has a national reach of 96.37% of all households in the United 
States (or 301,123,135 Americans with at least one television set). Currently, 
New Jersey, New Hampshire and Delaware are the only U.S. states where CBS 
does not have a locally licensed affiliate (New Jersey is served by New 
York City O&O WCBS-TV and Philadelphia O&O KYW-TV; Delaware is served by 
KYW and Salisbury, Maryland affiliate WBOC-TV; and New Hampshire is served 
by Boston O&O WBZ-TV and Burlington, Vermont affiliate WCAX-TV). As a newer 
broadcast network, CBS maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting 
either in analog or digital) in a few markets, such as Harrisonburg, Virginia 
(WSVF-CD), Palm Springs, California (KPSP-CD) and Parkersburg, West Virginia 
(WIYE-LD). In some markets, including both of those mentioned, these stations 
also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed 
full-power television station. CBS also maintains a sizeable number of 
subchannel-only affiliations, the majority of which are with stations in 
cities located outside of the 50 largest Nielsen-designated markets; the 
largest CBS subchannel affiliate by market size is KOGG in Wailuku, Hawaii, 
which serves as a repeater of Honolulu affiliate KGMB (the sister station 
of KOGG parent KHNL). Media General is the largest operator of CBS stations 
by numerical total, owning 26 CBS affiliates; Tegna Media is the largest 
operator of CBS stations in terms of overall market reach, owning 11 CBS-affiliated 
stations (including affiliates in the larger markets in Houston, Tampa 
and Washington, D.C.). CBS provides video on demand access for delayed 
viewing of the network's programming through various means, including via 
its website at CBS.com; the network's apps for iOS, Android and newer version 
Windows devices; a traditional VOD service called CBS on Demand available 
on most traditional cable and IPTV providers; and through content deals 
with Amazon Video (which holds exclusive streaming rights to two CBS drama 
series, Extant and Under the Dome) and Netflix.[150][151][152][153] Notably, 
however, CBS is the only major broadcast network that does not provide 
recent episodes of its programming on Hulu (sister network The CW does 
offer its programming on the streaming service, albeit on a one-week delay 
after becoming available on the network's website on Hulu's free service, 
with users of its subscription service being granted access to newer episodes 
of CW series eight hours after their initial broadcast), due to concerns 
over cannibalizing viewership of some of the network's most prominent programs; 
however, episode back catalogs of certain past and present CBS series are 
available on the service through an agreement with CBS Television Distribution.[154][155][156] 
Upon the release of the app in March 2013, CBS restricted streaming of 
the most recent episode of any of the network's program on its streaming 
app for Apple iOS devices until eight days after their initial broadcast, 
in order to encourage live or same-week (via both DVR and cable on demand) 
viewing; programming selections on the app were limited until the release 
of its Google Play and Windows 8 apps in October 2013, expanded the selections 
to include full episodes of all CBS series to which the network does not 
license the streaming rights to other services.[157] On October 28, 2014, 
CBS launched CBS All Access, an over-the-top subscription streaming service 
– priced at $5.99 per month ($9.99 with the no commercials option) – which 
allows users to view past and present episodes of CBS shows.[158][159][160] 
Announced on October 16, 2014 (one day after HBO announced the launch of 
its over-the-top service HBO Now) as the first OTT offering by an USA broadcast 
television network, the service initially encompassed the network's existing 
streaming portal at CBS.com and its mobile app for smartphones and tablet 
computers; CBS All Access became available on Roku on April 7, 2015, and 
on Chromecast on May 14, 2015.[161][162] In addition to providing full-length 
episodes of CBS programs, the service allows live programming streams of 
local CBS affiliates in 124 markets reaching 75% of the United States.[163][164][165][166][167] 
CBS All Access offers the most recent episodes of the network's shows the 
day after their original broadcast, as well as complete back catalogs of 
most of its current series and a wide selection of episodes of classic 
series from the CBS Television Distribution program library, to subscribers 
of the service. CBS All Access also carries behind-the-scenes features 
from CBS programs and special events.[158] Original programs expected to 
air on CBS All Access include a new new Star Trek series, a spin-off of 
The Good Wife, and an online version of Big Brother.[168][169][170] CBS's 
master feed is transmitted in 1080i high definition, the native resolution 
format for CBS Corporation's television properties. However, seven of its 
affiliates transmit the network's programming in 720p HD, while seven others 
carry the network feed in 480i standard definition[148] either due to technical 
considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry CBS programming 
on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed CBS affiliate has not 
yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented 
in HD. CBS began its conversion to high definition with the launch of its 
simulcast feed, CBS HD, on September 1998 at the start of the 1998–99 season. 
That year, the network aired the first NFL game ever broadcast in high-definition, 
with the telecast of the New York Jets–Buffalo Bills game on November 8. 
The network gradually converted much of its existing programming from standard-definition 
to high definition beginning with the 2000–01 season, with select shows 
among that season's slate of freshmen scripted series being broadcast in 
HD from their debuts. The Young and the Restless became the first daytime 
soap opera to broadcast in HD on June 27, 2001.[171] CBS's 14-year conversion 
to an entirely high definition schedule ended in 2014, with Big Brother 
and Let's Make a Deal becoming the final two network series to convert 
from 4:3 standard definition to HD (in contrast, NBC, Fox and The CW were 
already airing their entire programming schedules – outside of Saturday 
mornings – in high definition by the 2010–11 season, while ABC was broadcasting 
its entire schedule in HD by the 2011–12 midseason). All of the network's 
programming has been presented in full HD since then (with the exception 
of certain holiday specials produced prior to 2005 – such as the Rankin-Bass 
specials – which continue to be presented in 4:3 SD, although some have 
been remastered for HD broadcast). As of September 1, 2016 when ABC converted 
to a 16:9 widescreen presentation, CBS and The CW are currently the only 
remaining networks which frame their promotions and on-screen graphical 
elements for a 4:3 presentation, though with CBS Sports's de facto 16:9 
conversion with Super Bowl 50 and their new graphical presentation designed 
for 16:9 framing, in practice most CBS affiliates ask pay-TV providers 
to pass down a 16:9 widescreen presentation by default over their standard 
definition channels. The CBS television network's initial logo, used from 
the 1940s to 1951, consisted of an oval spotlight which shone on the block 
letters "C-B-S".[172] The present-day Eye device was conceived by William 
Golden, based on a Pennsylvania Dutch hex sign as well as a Shaker drawing 
(while commonly attributed to Golden, there is speculation that at least 
some design work on the symbol may have been done by another CBS staff 
designer, Georg Olden, one of the first African-Americans to attract some 
attention in the postwar graphic design field).[173] The Eye device made 
its broadcast debut on October 20, 1951. The following season, as Golden 
prepared a new "ident", CBS President Frank Stanton insisted on keeping 
the Eye device and using it as much as possible (Golden died unexpectedly 
in 1959, and was replaced by one of his top assistants, Lou Dorfsman, who 
would go on to oversee all print and on-air graphics for CBS for the next 
30 years). The CBS eye has since become an American icon. While the symbol's 
settings have changed, the Eye device itself has not been redesigned in 
its entire history.[174] As part of a new graphical identity created by 
Trollbäck + Company that was introduced by the television network in 2006, 
the eye was placed in a "trademark" position on show titles, days of the 
week and descriptive words, an approach highly respecting the value of 
the design. The logo is alternately known as the Eyemark, which was also 
the name of CBS's domestic and international syndication divisions in the 
mid-to-late 1990s before the King World acquisition and Viacom merger. 
The eye logo has frequently been copied or borrowed by television networks 
around the world. Notable examples include the Austrian Broadcasting System 
(ORF), which formerly used a red version of the eye logo; Associated Television 
(ATV) in the United Kingdom; Frecuencia Latina in Peru; Fuji Television 
in Japan; Rede Bandeirantes and Rede Globo in Brazil; and Saeta TV Channel 
10 in Uruguay. The network celebrated the 60th anniversary of the introduction 
of the Eye logo in October 2011, featuring special IDs shown during the 
network's prime time lineup of logo versions from previous CBS image campaigns.[175] 
Through the years, CBS has developed several notable image campaigns, and 
several of the network's most well-known slogans were introduced in the 
1980s. The "Reach for the Stars" campaign used during the 1981–82 season 
feature a space theme used to capitalize on both CBS's stellar improvement 
in the ratings and the historic launch of the space shuttle Columbia. 1982's 
"Great Moments" juxtaposed scenes from classic CBS programs such as I Love 
Lucy with scenes from the network's then-current classics such as Dallas 
and M*A*S*H. From 1983 to 1986, CBS (by now firmly atop the ratings) featured 
a campaign based on the slogan "We've Got the Touch". Vocals for the campaign's 
jingle were contributed by Richie Havens (1983–84; one occasion in 1984–85) 
and Kenny Rogers (1985–86). The 1986–87 season ushered in the "Share the 
Spirit of CBS" campaign, the network's first to completely use computer 
graphics and DVE effects. Unlike most network campaign promos, the full-length 
version of "Share the Spirit" not only showed a brief clip preview of each 
new fall series, but also utilized CGI effects to map out the entire fall 
schedule by night. The success of that campaign led to the 1987–88 "CBS 
Spirit" (or "CBSPIRIT") campaign. Like with its predecessor campaign, most 
"CBSpirit" promos utilized a procession of clips from the network's programs. 
However, the new graphic motif was a swirling (or "swishing") blue line, 
that was used to represent "the spirit." The full length promo, like the 
previous year, had a special portion that identified new fall shows, but 
the mapped-out fall schedule shot was abandoned. For the 1988–89 season, 
CBS unveiled a new image campaign, officially known as "Television You 
Can Feel", but more commonly identified as "You Can Feel It On CBS". The 
goal was to convey a more sensual, new-age image through distinguished, 
advanced-looking computer graphics and soothing music, backgrounding images 
and clips of emotionally powerful scenes and characters. However, it was 
this season in which CBS began its ratings freefall, the deepest in the 
network's history. CBS ended the decade with "Get Ready for CBS," introduced 
with the 1989–90 season. The initial version was a very ambitious campaign 
that attempted to elevate CBS out of last place (among the major networks); 
the motif centered around network stars interacting with each other in 
a remote studio set, getting ready for photo and television shoots, as 
well as for the new season on CBS. The high-energy promo song and the campaign's 
practices saw many customized variations by all of CBS's owned-and-operated 
stations and affiliates, which participated in the campaign per a network 
mandate. In addition, for the first time in history, CBS became the first 
broadcast network to partner with a national retailer (in this case, Kmart) 
to encourage viewership, with the "CBS/Kmart Get Ready Giveaway". For the 
1990–91 season, the campaign featured a new jingle performed by The Temptations, 
which offered an altered version of their hit "Get Ready". The early 1990s 
featured less-than-memorable campaigns, with simplified taglines such as 
"This is CBS" (1992) and "You're On CBS" (1995). Eventually, the promotions 
department gained momentum again late in the decade with "Welcome Home 
to a CBS Night" (1996–1997), simplified to Welcome Home (1997–1999) and 
succeeded by the spin-off campaign "The Address is CBS" (1999–2000). During 
the 1992 season for the end-of-show network identification sequence, a 
three-note sound mark was introduced, which was eventually adapted into 
the network's IDs and production company vanity cards following the closing 
credits of most of its programs during the "Welcome Home" era. Throughout 
the first decade of the 21st century, CBS's ratings resurgence was backed 
by the network's "It's All Here" campaign (which introduced updated versions 
of the 1992 sound mark used during certain promotions and production company 
vanity cards during the closing credits of programs); in 2005, the network's 
strategy led to the proclamation that it was "America's Most Watched Network". 
The network's 2006 campaign introduced the slogan "We Are CBS", with Don 
LaFontaine providing the voiceover for the IDs (as well as certain network 
promos) during this period. In 2009, the network introduced a campaign 
entitled "Only CBS," in which network promotions proclaim several unique 
qualities it has (the slogan was also used in program promotions following 
the announcement of the timeslot of a particular program). The "America's 
Most Watched Network" was re-introduced by CBS in 2011, used alongside 
the "Only CBS" slogan.[176] Especially during the 1960s, CBS as well as 
its two major network competitors, NBC, and ABC, utilized elaborate promos 
during the summer months to promote their upcoming fall schedules. In 1961, 
CBS took the unusual step of airing a program titled CBS Fall Preview Special: 
Seven Wonderful Nights,[177] using stars of several CBS shows – such as 
Ed Sullivan (The Ed Sullivan Show), Rod Serling (The Twilight Zone), and 
Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale (Perry Mason) – to promote the upcoming fall 
lineup, instead the network's continuity announcers, showing previews of 
the entire lineup for one specific day of the week.[178] Fall preview specials 
hosted by network stars would become commonplace among the broadcast networks 
in subsequent years. CBS programs are shown outside the United States, 
through various branded international networks and content agreements, 
and in two North American countries, through U.S.-based CBS stations. In 
India, CBS network programming is carried in Dish TV, Airtel, Reliance, 
DD Free Dish, Sun Direct Ability in All India In Canada, CBS network programming 
is carried on cable, satellite and IPTV providers in Canada through affiliates 
and owned-and-operated stations of the network that are located within 
proximity to the Canada–United States border (such as KIRO-TV/Seattle, 
KDLH/Duluth, Minnesota, WWJ-TV/Detroit and WIVB-TV/Buffalo, New York and 
WCAX-TV/Burlington, Vermont ), some of which may also be receivable over-the-air 
in parts of southern Canada depending on the signal coverage of the station. 
Most programming is generally the same as it airs in the United States; 
however, some CBS programming on U.S.-based affiliates permitted for carriage 
by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission by Canadian 
cable and satellite providers are subject to simultaneous substitutions, 
a practice in which a pay television provider supplants an American station's 
signal with a feed from a Canadian station/network airing a particular 
program in the same time slot to protect domestic advertising revenue. 
CBS programming is available in Mexico through affiliates in markets located 
within proximity to the Mexico–United States border (such as KSWT/Yuma, 
Arizona; KVTV/Laredo, Texas; KDBC-TV/El Paso, Texas; KGBT-TV/Harlingen, 
Texas; and KFMB-TV/San Diego), whose signals are readily receivable over-the-air 
in border areas of northern Mexico. In the U.S. territory of Guam, the 
network is affiliated with low-power station KUAM-LP in Hagåtña. Entertainment 
and non-breaking news programming is shown day and date on a one-day tape 
delay, as Guam is located on the west side of the International Date Line 
(for example, NCIS, which airs on Tuesday nights, is carried Wednesdays 
on KUAM-LP, and is advertised by the station as airing on the latter night 
in on-air promotions), with live programming and breaking news coverage 
airing as scheduled, meaning live sports coverage often airs early in the 
morning. Sky News broadcasts the CBS Evening News on its channels serving 
the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Italy. On September 
14, 2009, the international arm of CBS, CBS Studios International, reached 
a joint venture deal with Chellomedia to launch six CBS-branded channels 
in the United Kingdom – which would respectively replace Zone Romantica, 
Zone Thriller, Zone Horror and Zone Reality, as well as timeshift services 
Zone Horror +1 and Zone Reality +1 – during the fourth quarter of that 
year.[179][180] On October 1, 2009, it was announced that the first four 
channels, CBS Reality, CBS Reality +1, CBS Drama and CBS Action, would 
launch on November 16 – respectively replacing Zone Reality, Zone Reality 
+1, Zone Romantica and Zone Thriller.[181] On April 5, 2010, Zone Horror 
and Zone Horror +1 were rebranded as Horror Channel and Horror Channel 
+1.[182][183] In Australia, Network Ten (which CBS owns 33% of its shares) 
maintains a distribution agreement with CBS Television Distribution that 
gives the network rights to carry programs such as Entertainment Tonight, 
Dr. Phil, Late Show with Stephen Colbert, NCIS and Scorpion. Nine Network 
maintains the rights to story content sourced from 60 Minutes, used on 
the domestic program of the same title, while reports provided by Network 
Ten are used in the United States by CBS for supplementary coverage of 
Australian topics. Network Ten's sister digital channels One and Eleven 
also carry CBS programming. In Bermuda, CBS maintains an affiliation with 
Hamilton-based ZBM-TV, locally owned by Bermuda Broadcasting Company. In 
Hong Kong, the CBS Evening News was broadcast live during the early morning 
hours on ATV; networks in that country maintains agreement to rebroadcast 
portions of the program 12 hours after the initial broadcast to provide 
additional content in the event that their affiliates have insufficient 
news content to fill time during their local news programs. In the Philippines, 
the CBS Evening News is broadcast on satellite network Q-TV (a sister channel 
of GMA Network), while CBS This Morning is shown in that country on the 
Lifestyle Network. The Late Show with David Letterman is broadcast by Studio 
23 and Maxx, which are both owned by ABS-CBN. 60 Minutes is currently broadcast 
on CNN Philippines (formerly Talktv, Solar News Channel and 9TV ) as a 
part of their Stories block, which includes documentaries and is broadcast 
on Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. before CNN Philippines Nightly News with replays 
in a capacity as a stand-alone program on Saturdays at 8:00 a.m. & 5:00 
pm and Sundays at 6:00 a.m, all in local time (UTC + 8). In India, CBS 
maintained a brand licensing agreement with Reliance Broadcast Network 
Ltd. for three CBS-branded channels: Big CBS Prime, Big CBS Spark and Big 
CBS Love. These channels were shut down in late November 2013. In 1995, 
CBS refused to air a 60 Minutes segment that featured an interview with 
a former president of research and development for Brown & Williamson, 
the U.S.'s third largest tobacco company. The controversy raised questions 
about the legal roles in decision-making and whether journalistic standards 
should be compromised despite legal pressures and threats. The decision 
nevertheless sent shockwaves throughout the television industry, the journalism 
community, and the country.[184] This incident was the basis for the 1999 
Michael Mann-directed drama film, The Insider. In 2001, Bernard Goldberg, 
who served as a correspondent for CBS News for 28 years, authored Bias: 
A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News. The book heavily 
criticized the media, and some CBS anchors and correspondents in particular 
(such as Dan Rather). Goldberg accused CBS of having a liberal bias in 
most of their news coverage;[185] Goldberg now works as a commentator for 
Fox News. In 2004, the Federal Communications Commission imposed a record 
$550,000 fine, the largest fine ever for a violation of federal decency 
laws, against CBS for an incident during its broadcast of Super Bowl XXXVIII 
in which singer Janet Jackson's right breast (which was partially covered 
by a piece of nipple jewelry) was briefly and accidentally exposed by guest 
performer Justin Timberlake at the end of a duet performance of Timberlake's 
2003 single "Rock Your Body" during the halftime show (produced by then 
sister cable network MTV).[186] Following the incident, CBS apologized 
to its viewers and denied foreknowledge of the incident, which was televised 
live. The incident resulted in a period of increased regulation of broadcast 
television and radio outlets (including self-imposed content regulation 
by networks and syndicators), which raised concerns surrounding censorship 
and freedom of speech,[187] and resulted in the FCC voting to increase 
its maximum fine for indecency violations from US$27,500 to US$325,000.[188] 
In 2008, a Philadelphia federal court annulled the fine imposed on CBS, 
labelling it "arbitrary and capricious".[189] On September 8, 2004, less 
than two months before the Presidential election in which he defeated Democratic 
candidate John Kerry, CBS aired a controversial episode of 60 Minutes Wednesday, 
which questioned then-President George W. Bush's service in the Air National 
Guard in 1972 and 1973.[190] Following allegations of forgery, CBS News 
admitted that four of the documents used in the story had not been properly 
authenticated and admitted that their source, Bill Burkett, had admitted 
to having "deliberately misled" a CBS News producer who worked on the report, 
about the documents' origins out of a confidentiality promise to the actual 
source.[191][192] The following January, CBS fired four people connected 
to the preparation of the segment.[193] Former CBS news anchor Dan Rather 
filed a $70 million lawsuit against CBS and former corporate parent Viacom 
in September 2007, contending the story, and his termination (he resigned 
as CBS News chief anchor in 2005), were mishandled.[194][195] Parts of 
the suit were dismissed in 2008;[196] subsequently in 2010, the entire 
suit was dismissed and Rather's motion to appeal was denied.[197] In 2007, 
retired Army Major Gen. and CBS News consultant John Batiste appeared in 
a political ad for VoteVets.org that was critical of President George W. 
Bush and the war in Iraq. Two days later, CBS stated that appearing in 
the ad violated Batiste's contract with the network, which was terminated 
as a result.[198] In January 2013, CNET named Dish Network's "Hopper with 
Sling" digital video recorder as a nominee for the CES "Best in Show" award 
(which is decided by CNET on behalf of its organizers, the Consumer Electronics 
Association), and named it the winner in a vote by the site's staff. However, 
CBS division CBS Interactive disqualified the Hopper, and vetoed the results 
as CBS was in active litigation with Dish Network over its AutoHop technology 
(which allows users to skip commercial advertisements during recorded programs).[199] 
CNET announced that it would no longer review any product or service provided 
by companies that CBS Corporation was in litigation with. The "Best in 
Show" award was instead given to the Razer Edge tablet.[200][201][202] 
On January 14, 2013, CNET editor-in-chief Lindsey Turrentine said in a 
statement that its staff was in an "impossible" situation due to the conflict 
of interest posed by the lawsuit, and promised to prevent a similar incident 
from occurring again. The conflict also prompted the resignation of CNET 
senior writer Greg Sandoval.[201] As a result of the controversy, the CEA 
announced on January 31, 2013 that CNET will no longer decide the CES Best 
in Show award winner due to the interference of CBS (with the position 
being offered to other technology publications), and the "Best in Show" 
award was jointly awarded to both the Hopper with Sling and Razer Edge.[202][203]
