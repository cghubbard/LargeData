The Chicago Maroons football represents the University of Chicago in college 
football. The Maroons play in NCAA Division III as an independent team. 
From 1892 to 1939, the Maroons were a major college football power. The 
University of Chicago was a founding member of the Big Ten Conference and 
the Maroons were coached by Amos Alonzo Stagg, one of the game's pioneers, 
for 41 seasons. In 1935, halfback Jay Berwanger became the first recipient 
of the Downtown Athletic Club Trophy, later known as the Heisman Trophy. 
Nonetheless, in the late 1930s, university president Robert Maynard Hutchins 
decided that big-time college football and the university's commitment 
to academics was not a good fit.[2] The University of Chicago abolished 
its football program in 1939 and withdrew from the Big Ten in 1946. Football 
returned to the University of Chicago in 1963 in the form of a club team, 
which was upgraded to varsity status in 1969. The Maroons began competing 
in Division III in 1973. All-Time Record Against Current Big Ten Members[4]
