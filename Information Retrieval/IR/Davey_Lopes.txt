As player As manager As coach David Earle Lopes (/ˈloʊps/; born May 3, 
1945 in East Providence, Rhode Island) is a former second baseman and manager 
in Major League Baseball (MLB). He batted and threw right-handed. He played 
in MLB for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Oakland Athletics, Chicago Cubs and 
Houston Astros and managed the Milwaukee Brewers. He is currently the first 
base coach for the Washington Nationals. Lopes was drafted by the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in the 2nd round of the 1968 MLB January Draft. Previously he had 
played in High School at La Salle Academy and in college for Iowa Wesleyan 
College and Washburn University. He had previously been drafted by the 
San Francisco Giants in the 8th round of the 1967 MLB draft but did not 
sign. He made his Major League debut for the Dodgers on September 22, 1972 
against the San Francisco Giants and was 0 for 5 in that game.[1] He recorded 
his first hit on a single to right field off of the Giants Jim Barr on 
September 24, 1972.[2] His first home run was hit on May 13, 1973, also 
against Barr.[3] Lopes spent nine seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers 
as their regular second baseman. Along with Steve Garvey (1B), Bill Russell 
(SS) and Ron Cey (3B), they formed the longest running infield in baseball 
history, which stayed together for eight and a half seasons.[4] Used in 
the leadoff role most of his career, Lopes was one of the most effective 
base stealers in baseball's modern era.[5] His 557 career stolen bases 
rank 26th all-time, but his success rate of 83.01% (557 steals in only 
671 attempts) ranks 3rd-best all time among players with 400 or more career 
stolen bases (behind Tim Raines and Willie Wilson). In 1975, Lopes stole 
38 consecutive bases without getting caught, breaking a 53-year-old record 
set by Max Carey.[6] Lopes' record was later broken by Vince Coleman in 
1989. Lopes led the National League with 77 steals in 1975, and again with 
63 the following season. A rare blend of speed and power, Lopes hit a career-high 
28 home runs in 1979, becoming one of only seven second basemen in NL history 
to have hit that many home runs in a season (Rogers Hornsby, Davey Johnson, 
Jeff Kent, Ryne Sandberg, Juan Samuel and Chase Utley are the others). 
He also hit 17 twice (1978 and 1983), appeared in four consecutive All-Star 
games from 1978 to 1981, played in one Division Series, six NLCS and four 
World Series, including as a member of the 1981 World Champion Dodgers. 
Arguably Lopes' best World Series was against the Yankees in 1978, when 
he hit three home runs and seven RBIs. Before the 1982 season, the Dodgers 
sent Lopes to the Oakland Athletics (for minor leaguer Lance Hudson) to 
make room for rookie second baseman Steve Sax, breaking up the longest 
playing infield in history who had been starters since 1974. With Oakland, 
Lopes teamed with Rickey Henderson to steal 158 bases, setting a new American 
League record for teammates. Henderson collected 130, Lopes 28. The Athletics 
traded him to the Chicago Cubs on August 31, 1984 to complete an earlier 
deal for Chuck Rainey. He was then traded on July 21, 1986 to the Houston 
Astros for Frank DiPino. He stole 47 bases at the age of forty and 35 at 
forty-one, before retiring at the end of the 1987 season. In a 16-season 
career, Lopes posted a .263 batting average with 155 home runs and 614 
runs batted in in 1,812 games played. He played in four All-Star Games 
and four World Series.[7] Following his retirement as a player, Lopes coached 
first base for the Baltimore Orioles from 1992 to 1994 and the San Diego 
Padres from 1995 to 1999. Lopes was hired as the Milwaukee Brewers manager 
in 2000 following Bud Selig's recommendation to hire a manager with a minority 
background.[7] Tired of the Brewers' continued poor performance and Lopes' 
media and field antics, club management fired him as manager fifteen games 
into the 2002 season.[8] He was 144-195 in 3 seasons with the Brewers.[9] 
Lopes rejoined the Padres as first base coach from 2003 to 2005 and then 
held the same position with the Washington Nationals in 2006 and the Philadelphia 
Phillies from 2007 to 2010. In each of his Lopes' three seasons with the 
Phillies, the team led the majors in stolen base percentage, including 
the best in MLB history in 2007 – 87.9% (138-for-157). They finished second 
or third in total steals each of those seasons.[10] On November 22, 2010 
he was named the first base coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers, a position 
he held through the 2015 season. On November 5, 2015, he was named the 
first base coach of the Washington Nationals. In 2001 Lopes was the target 
of controversy following statements he made regarding stolen-base king 
Rickey Henderson. Managing a game for the Milwaukee Brewers, Lopes was 
enraged that Henderson had stolen second base in the seventh inning, while 
Henderson's Padres held a seven-run lead. Lopes said that this violated 
an unwritten rule against "showing up" the opposing team. Lopes was quoted, 
"He was going on his ass. We were going to drill him."[12] Henderson withdrew 
from the game as a result. Lopes was diagnosed with prostate cancer following 
a routine physical in February 2008.[13] He is of Cape Verdean descent.
