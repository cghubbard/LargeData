Frank Eugene Bowerman (December 5, 1868 â€“ November 30, 1948) was an American 
catcher and manager in Major League Baseball with the Baltimore Orioles, 
the Pittsburgh Pirates, the New York Giants, and the Boston Doves, as well 
as a player-manager for the Doves in his last season in professional baseball. 
While always playing in the shadows of Wilbert Robinson and Roger Bresnahan, 
he was a solid player who could play any position in the diamond, and he 
even pitched an inning for the Giants in 1904. He was also the first to 
catch Hall-of-Famer Christy Mathewson. Bowerman was known for having a 
short fuse, as he repeatedly got into fights with players, umpires, and 
fans. In one such case in 1903, he punched a heckler in the face and got 
arrested. He also started a fight with manager Fred Clarke while with the 
Pirates and gave him a black eye. The Doves hired him as manager during 
the 1909 season, but his fiery temper did not go well with his team, and 
he was relegated to player-only status after only 76 games. Bowerman died 
in his birthplace of Romeo, Michigan five days shy of his 80th birthday.
