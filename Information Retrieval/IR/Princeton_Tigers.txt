The Princeton Tigers are the athletic teams of Princeton University. The 
school sponsors 31 varsity sports. The school has won several NCAA national 
championships, including one in men's fencing, six in men's lacrosse, three 
in women's lacrosse, and eight in men's golf. Princeton's men's and women's 
crews have also won numerous national rowing championships. The field hockey 
team made history in 2012 as the first Ivy League team to win the Division 
I NCAA Championship in field hockey. Princeton's basketball team is perhaps 
the best-known team within the Ivy League. It is nicknamed the "perennial 
giant killer," a nickname that it acquired during Pete Carril's coaching 
career from 1967–1996. Its most notable upset was the 1996 defeat of defending 
NCAA champion UCLA in the tournament's opening round, Carril's final collegiate 
victory. In 1989, the team almost became the only #16 seed to win, losing 
to Georgetown 50-49,[2] after leading 29–21 at the half. During that 29-year 
span, Pete Carril won thirteen Ivy League championships and received eleven 
NCAA berths and two NIT bids. Princeton placed third in the 1965 NCAA Tournament 
and won the NIT championship in 1975. The deliberate "Princeton offense" 
is a legacy of his coaching career. It is employed by a number of other 
collegiate basketball teams. From 1992–2001, a nine-year span, the men's 
basketball team entered the NCAA tournament four times. Notably, the Ivy 
League has never had an at-large entry in the NCAA tournament. For the 
last half-century, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania have traditionally 
battled for men's basketball dominance in the Ivy League; Princeton had 
its first losing season in 50 years of Ivy League basketball in 2005. Princeton 
tied the record for fewest points in a Division I game since the 3-point 
line started in 1986–87 when they scored 21 points in a loss against Monmouth 
University on December 14, 2005. The 1924–25 team was retroactively named 
the national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta 
Power Poll.[3] Princeton's Varsity Women's basketball program is the strongest 
in the Ivy League, carrying on the tradition of the men's championship 
basketball program. At no time was the women's team better than it was 
in 2015, with a 31-0 record, a national NCAA Division 1 ranking among the 
top 25 teams, and entering the field of 32 teams remaining in the 2015 
NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament. Courtney Banghart, a Dartmouth 
graduate, is entering her tenth season as the Tigers' highly esteemed head 
coach.[4] The football team has competed since 1869 and played in the first 
game against Rutgers University. They have won 24 national championships 
when the school competed in what is now known as the FBS.[5] Twenty-one 
former players have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. 
The first football game played between teams representing American colleges 
was an unfamiliar ancestor of today's college football because it was played 
under soccer-style London Football Association rules. The game, between 
Rutgers College (now Rutgers University) and the College of New Jersey 
(now Princeton University), took place on November 6, 1869 at College Field 
(now the site of the College Avenue Gymnasium at Rutgers University) in 
New Brunswick, New Jersey. Rutgers won by a score of six "runs" to Princeton's 
four. The 1869 game between Rutgers and Princeton is notable because it 
is the first documented game of any sport called "football" between two 
American colleges. It is also noteworthy because it occurred two years 
before a codified rugby game would be played in England. The Princeton/Rutgers 
game was significantly different from American rules football today but, 
nonetheless, it was the first inter-collegiate football contest in the 
United States. Another similar game took place between Rutgers and Columbia 
University in 1870 and a third notable game took place between Tufts University 
and Harvard University in 1875. The popularity of intercollegiate competition 
in football would spread throughout the country shortly thereafter.[citation

Subdivision, the Tigers have the most overall national championships of 
any team in major college football history with 24 consensus and non-consensus 
national championships dating all the way back to their first one, shared 
with Rutgers, in 1869.[6] Since 1901, however, they have 4 consensus national 
championships, which ranks as tied for 11th all time.[citation needed] 
Princeton's football helmets are also the basis for Michigan Wolverines 
football team's famed winged helmets, as introduced by Fritz Crisler, the 
coach at Princeton before he was hired as the coach of The University of 
Michigan. In addition to the varsity Tigers, Princeton, like a number of 
other Ivy League schools, also fielded a sprint football squad for players 
172 pounds and lighter from 1934 to 2015. The lightweight Tigers won at 
least a share of the league title eight times, five of those being from 
between 1937 and 1942. Their last championship, split with the Army Cadets, 
came in 1989. The Tigers sprint squad collapsed in 1999, which began a 
losing streak that spanned parts of 17 seasons and 106 games (a collegiate 
football record), including at least four forfeits; by the end of the 2015 
season, Princeton's athletics department determined that the addition of 
several schools whose sole football team was a sprint squad (and thus were 
teams that could get all of the best players at their respective schools) 
and the loss of most of the Ivy League schools, along with the inability 
of Princeton to recruit more and better players for the team without compromising 
its other athletic programs, meant that the team would likely be hopelessly 
outmatched and that this would pose a safety hazard for the players they 
could recruit. This conclusion led Princeton to drop sprint football in 
April 2016. The men's golf team have won 12 national championships: 1914, 
1916, 1919–20, 1922–23, 1927–30, 1937, and 1940 (tied with LSU). They have 
had seven NCAA individual champions: Louis Bayard, Jr. (1987), Percy Pyne 
(1899), Frank Reinhart (1903), Albert Seckel (1909), Simpson Dean (1921) 
and George Dunlap (1930 and 1931). They have won the Ivy League title 29 
times: 1928, 1930, 1938–39, 1947, 1961, 1969, 1972, 1973, 1976, 1977, 1979, 
1980, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 2000, 2001, 
2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2013.[7] The women's golf team was founded as a 
club sport in 1978, coached by Betty Whelan. A group called "Friends of 
Women's Golf" began fundraising immediately, and the group began lobbying 
for inclusion as a varsity sport. After ten years of being denied varsity 
status by the university, representatives from the team contacted the ACLU 
asking for assistance and raising the possibility of a lawsuit under the 
protections of Title IX of the Civil Rights Act. In 1991, the university 
committed to supporting a varsity women's golf program.[8] After becoming 
a varsity team, women's golf too the Northeast championships in 1995, and 
Mary Moan won the first Ivy League individual championship in 1997. The 
team won its first Ivy League title in 1999.[9] The university's men's 
lacrosse team has enjoyed significant success since the early 1990s and 
is widely recognized as a perennial powerhouse in the Division I ranks. 
The team has won thirteen Ivy League titles (1992, 1993, 1995–2004, 2006) 
and six national titles (1992, 1994, 1996–1998, 2001).[10] The Princeton 
Tigers women's lacrosse team has enjoyed much success, winning 3 NCAA championships, 
tied for 3rd place with Virginia in the number of NCAA championships won.They 
won NCAA division 1 titles in 1994, 2002, and 2003. Their record in the 
NCAA tournament finals is 3-4. Rowing was introduced to Princeton in 1870 
by a handful of undergraduates who bought two old boats with their own 
funds and formed an impromptu "navy" on the Delaware and Raritan Canal.[11] 
The construction of Lake Carnegie in 1906 enabled the sport to expand and 
laid the foundation for today's rowing program at Princeton. More recently, 
an $8 million upgrade and expansion of the existing boathouse in 2000 formed 
Shea Rowing Center, one of the finest rowing facilities in the country. 
With 150 athletes, 60 rowing shells, and 12 coaches, trainers, and boat 
riggers, crew is the largest varsity sport at Princeton, and one of the 
most successful. In recent years, from 2000 through 2010, Princeton varsity 
crews (both men's and women's) won a total of 14 Eastern Sprints, IRA (national), 
and NCAA championships, as well as two international events at Henley Royal 
Regatta. The Princeton boathouse is often a summer base for U.S. national 
teams in training, and many Princeton rowers and coaches have gone on to 
compete at the World Rowing Championships and the Olympics. Main article

Champions in 2004, 1979, 1977, 1973, 1971 and 1969. National champions 
in 1995 and 1996. Princeton women advanced to the Final Four in 1997, 1999, 
2000, 2001, 2004 and 2005. 32 Princeton women have been named All-Americans. 
Before the NCAA began its tournament in 1951, the annual national champion 
was declared by the Intercollegiate Association Football League (IAFL) 
— from 1911 to 1926 — and then the Intercollegiate Soccer Football Association 
(ISFA), from 1927 to 1958. From 1911 to 1958, Princeton won seven national 
championships. In 2004, the women's soccer team went to the Final Four 
in the NCAA tournament. It became the only Ivy League team (men's or women's) 
to do so in a 64-team tournament.[citation needed] Princeton's softball 
team appeared in two Women's College World Series in 1995 and 1996.[12] 
Princeton's men's and women's squash teams have earned a strong reputation 
during the past decade. The men have won the Ivy League championship from 
2006–2008 and have placed second nationally in five of the past seven championships.[citation 
needed] On February 19, the Tigers defeated the Trinity Bantams in a 5-4 
thriller. The Bantams had won the past 13 National Championship and up 
until a few weeks prior to the Championship, had won 252 matches straight 
(before falling to Yale 5-4). The Tigers were undefeated in the Ivy League 
in 2012 and won the Ivy League championship. They were also the winner 
of the Sloane Sportsmanship award. The men have won the Ivy League Championships 
from 2009-2013. They are coached by the fearless leader C. Rob Orr. In 
2015, the men's team won their 30th title in program history.[13] Led by 
Twitter celebrity, Rolls Boyce, the women have dominated the past decade. 
Princeton's women's track & field team has also enjoyed great success under 
Head Coach Peter Farrell. The men's volleyball program achieved varsity 
status in 1997 - though it had competed for two decades as a club sport 
before then - and competes in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association.[14] 
From their inaugural varsity season until 2009, the team was coached by 
Glenn Nelson, who was also the head coach of the Princeton women's volleyball 
team. The Tigers have the honor of being the only team since the formation 
of the EIVA in 1988 to win the EIVA championship and advance to the NCAA 
Men's National Collegiate Volleyball Championship, with every other title 
having been won by the Penn State Nittany Lions. The Tigers bested the 
Nittany Lions in the 1998 EIVA semifinals, then when on to beat Rutgers-Newark, 
thus winning the 1998 EIVA championship and automatically gaining a berth 
in the NCAA tournament. Since then, Princeton has failed to obtain the 
championship but has nevertheless remained competitive in its conference. 
Led by head coach Sam Shweisky,[15] the Tigers have had consistent success 
in the past five years, boasting a positive record for every year of his 
tenure.[16] Furthermore, Princeton has had victories over five ranked opponents 
in that time, compared to only three in the previous three years.[16] The 
Tigers have had three players earn All-American honors - Marin Gjaja '91, 
Derek Devens '98 and Cody Kessel '14. The Princeton women's volleyball 
team has won thirteen Ivy League titles and, in 1998, its men's volleyball 
team became the first non-scholarship school to make the NCAA Final Four 
in 25 years.[citation needed] With a history of over a century, the Princeton 
Tiger Wrestling team began in 1905. The Princeton wrestling team competes 
in Dillon Gym, an arena once dominated by the historic basketball icon 
Bill Bradley. However, the Princeton wrestling team has plenty of historic 
moments within its own facilities. Jadwin Gym has served host to five previous 
EIWA Championships (1969, 1979, 1981, 1987 and 2012), as well as both the 
1975 and 1981 NCAA Wrestling Championships. The current head coach is Chris 
Ayres. Within Jadwin Gym is the Class of 1958 Wrestling Room, home of both 
the coaching staff and the practice mats.[17] With 51 Princeton wrestlers 
have combined to make a total of 75 appearances at the NCAA Wrestling Championships. 
Bradley Glass won the unlimited title in 1951, marking Princeton's only 
NCAA champion in the sport. Seven Princeton wrestlers have made three trips 
to the NCAAs The Wrestling tigers give out end of the season team awards 
for the following categories:[18] As of July 2, 2016, Princeton has 24 
NCAA team national championships.[19] † The NCAA started sponsoring the 
intercollegiate golf championship in 1939, but it retained the titles from 
the 41 championships previously conferred by the National Intercollegiate 
Golf Association in its records. The stadium is Princeton University Stadium, 
which replaced Palmer Stadium. Baseball is played at Bill Clarke Field. 
Basketball is played at Jadwin Gymnasium. Ice hockey is played at Baker 
Rink. Soccer is played at Roberts Stadium. Lacrosse is played at Class 
of 1952 Stadium. The men's and women's volleyball teams and the wrestling 
team compete at Dillon Gymnasium. All crews train at Shea Rowing Center 
and compete on Lake Carnegie. The Rugby Team plays at Rickerson Field on
