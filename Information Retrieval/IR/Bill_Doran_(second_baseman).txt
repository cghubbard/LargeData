William Donald Doran (born May 28, 1958) is a former second baseman in 
Major League Baseball who played from 1982 to 1993 with the Houston Astros 
(drafted in 6th round of 1979), Cincinnati Reds, and Milwaukee Brewers. 
He was the bench coach for the Kansas City Royals from 2005 to 2007 and 
posted a 4-6 record as the Royals' interim manager to close the 2006 season. 
Doran rejoined the Cincinnati Reds on November 2, 2007, as the minor league 
infielding/baserunning coordinator. Doran attended Mount Healthy High School 
and played baseball at the Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Doran was 
selected by the Houston Astros in the sixth round of the 1979 draft. He 
made his major league debut with the team in 1982. In 1986, the Astros 
went to the playoffs and Doran finished eleventh in the voting for NL Most 
Valuable Player.[1] In the 1986 National League Championship Series, Doran 
hit a two-run home run in a Game Three loss for the Astros. Before the 
1987 season, Doran lost an arbitration case with the Astros. Paid $550,000 
in 1986, he was seeking $825,000. Doran received only $625,000.[2] He had 
his best year that season. He led the NL in games played (162), batted 
.283, hit a career high 16 home runs, had a career high .992 fielding percentage, 
and scored a career high 79 runs. After the 1988 season, Doran underwent 
rotator cuff surgery.[3] In August 1990, Doran was traded to the Cincinnati 
Reds for three players to be named later. He turned down a trade to the 
New York Mets the day before.[4] Although the Reds won the World Series 
that year, Doran had back surgery the day the team clinched the division 
pennant and he missed the rest of the season. "I didn't feel like I belonged. 
I was just a rented player", Doran said.[5] In 1992, Cincinnati's Bip Roberts 
emerged as a standout second baseman and made the NL All-Star team. The 
Reds sold Doran to the Milwaukee Brewers in January 1993.[6] He retired 
in 1993 after struggling with injuries that season. Doran had a career 
.266 batting average, but had four seasons when he placed in the top 10 
in the National League in bases on balls. Doran never made an All-Star 
team, but was extraordinarily popular at The Astrodome and admired for 
his hustle and ferocity, reminiscent of Cincinnati native Pete Rose. He 
was widely considered the best Astros second baseman in team history until 
the emergence of Craig Biggio, who eclipsed Doran in offensive statistics 
but never approached Doran's defensive capacity. He is among the career 
leaders in many offensive categories for the Astros. He is top 10 in at 
bats (8th), runs (8th), hits (8th), singles (8th), triples (10th), total 
bases (9th), and bases on balls (6th). Doran became a minor league instructor 
for the Reds in 1995. In 1999 and 2000, Doran served as the organization's 
minor league field coordinator, director of player development and assistant 
to the general manager. He became a major league coach for the Reds in 
November 2000.[7] After a 96-loss season in 2001, the Reds did not renew 
the contracts of Doran or third base coach Ron Oester.[8] Doran joined 
the Kansas City Royals coaching staff in 2005 and became their bench coach 
the following year. He is currently a special assistant to the Reds. Doran 
resides in Cincinnati. He has three children. His son Ryan, who is named 
after Doran's teammate Nolan Ryan, was a player in the Reds' minor-league
