Fox Sports Oklahoma is an American regional sports network that is owned 
by Fox Cable Networks, a unit of the Fox Entertainment Group division of 
21st Century Fox, and operates as an affiliate of Fox Sports Networks. 
The channel provides statewide coverage of sports events within the state 
of Oklahoma, namely the Oklahoma City Thunder, the state's major college 
sports teams, and high school sports. Fox Sports Oklahoma is available 
on cable providers throughout Oklahoma, and nationwide on satellite via 
DirecTV. Fox Sports Oklahoma launched on October 29, 2008 as a spinoff 
of Fox Sports Southwest. It was created order to serve as the cable broadcaster 
of the Oklahoma City Thunder, after Fox Sports Southwest acquired the broadcast 
rights to the NBA franchise following its relocation to Oklahoma City that 
year from Seattle.[1] It initially split the rights to Thunder game telecasts 
with independent station KSBI (channel 52, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate), 
under an agreement in which Fox Sports Oklahoma would produce a limited 
schedule of regular season games (most of which aired on weekends) for 
the station; the Thunder signed a new multi-year broadcast agreement with 
Fox Sports Oklahoma on August 3, 2010, rendering the team's games cable-exclusive 
beginning with the 2010-11 season.[2] In addition to holding the regional 
television rights to Thunder's regular season and any early-round playoff 
games, Fox Sports Oklahoma also broadcasts sporting events from the Oklahoma 
Sooners and the Oklahoma State Cowboys, including basketball, baseball 
and football telecasts.[1] The channel also holds exclusive broadcast rights 
to state football, basketball and baseball championships held by the Oklahoma 
Secondary School Activities Association. Fox Sports Oklahoma has broadcast 
Class A-6A Football Championship games and periodically runs OSSAA Championship 
Spotlight, a magazine program that highlights various high school sports 
depending on the time of year.[3] Fox Sports Oklahoma also broadcasts pre-game 
and post-game shows for the Oklahoma City Thunder (under the Thunder Live 
banner), and Oklahoma Sooners and Oklahoma State Cowboys-related programs 
(such as coaches' shows and team magazine programs). Outside of programming 
exclusive to Fox Sports Oklahoma, the channel runs various programs supplied 
by Fox Sports Southwest (including sports interview, magazine and analysis 
programs focusing on Texas sports) as well as some game telecasts including 
Texas Rangers baseball, Dallas Stars hockey. Fox Sports Oklahoma Plus (also 
branded as "FOX Sports Oklahoma +" or FS OKLAHOMA +") is an alternate feed 
of Fox Sports Oklahoma used to broadcast select events within the designated 
market that cannot air on the main feed due to scheduling conflicts.[4] 
Fox Sports Oklahoma Plus primarily serves an overflow feed in the event 
that teams whose games Fox Sports Oklahoma has the right to broadcast play 
conflicting games simultaneously, mainly those that are televised on Fox 
Sports Southwest that may otherwise also air on Fox Sports Oklahoma (such 
as Texas Rangers or Dallas Stars) are scheduled to be held at the same 
time as the scheduled telecast of a Thunder, Sooners or Cowboys game, or 
a high school or collegiate sporting event involving an Oklahoma team.
