Harry Wayne Comer (born February 3, 1944) is a former Major League Baseball 
outfielder. He played professional baseball for 13 seasons from 1962 through 
1974, including stints with four Major League teams: the Detroit Tigers 
(1967, 1968, 1972), the Seattle Pilots (1969), the Milwaukee Brewers (1970), 
and the Washington Senators (1970). In 1969, Comer's only full season in 
Major League Baseball, he led the Seattle Pilots in runs scored, led the 
American League in double plays turned as an outfielder, and ranked second 
in the American League in assists from the outfield. He was also a member 
of the 1968 Detroit Tigers and compiled a perfect 1.000 postseason batting 
average with a pinch-hit single off Joe Hoerner in his only at bat in Game 
5 of the 1968 World Series. Comer was born in 1944 in Shenandoah, Virginia.[1] 
He was raised there and attended Page County High School. He was an all-around 
athlete in high school, playing baseball, basketball and football. He was 
selected as an all-state player in football.[2][3] Comer was originally 
signed in 1962 by the Washington Senators as an amateur free agent. He 
played for the Raleigh Capitals in 1962.[4] In March 1963, Comer was traded 
to the Detroit Tigers for Bobo Osborne.[5] He spent the 1963 season with 
the Lakeland Tigers in the Florida State League.[4][6] He next played for 
the Duluth–Superior Dukes in 1964 and the Montgomery Rebels in 1965. In 
1965, he led the Southern League with 31 stolen bases, compiled a .285 
batting average, and hit nine home runs. At the end of the 1965 season, 
he was named to the Southern League All-Star Team.[3] Comer began the 1966 
season with the Syracuse Chiefs of the International League. However, after 
only 35 games with the Chiefs, he was traded by the Chiefs to the Toledo 
Mud Hens in exchange for outfielder Art Lopez.[7][8] He was the Mud Hens 
starting center fielder in 1966 and compiled a .266 batting average with 
11 home runs and 52 RBIs.[9] During the 1967 season, Comer compiled a career 
high .290 batting average with a .363 on-base percentage.[4] He also led 
the International League in runs scored, total bases, and putouts and assists 
by an outfielder.[10] At the end of the 1967 season, he was named by the 
National Association of Baseball Writers to the 1967 East Triple-A All-Star 
team.[11] In September 1967, Comer was called up by the Detroit Tigers. 
He made his Major League debut on September 17, 1967, and appeared in four 
games for the 1967 Tigers. With one hit in three at bats, he compiled a 
.333 batting average.[1] The following year, Comer began the season in 
Toledo but was called up by the Tigers after Al Kaline broke a bone in 
his forearm in late May 1968.[3] Comer appeared in 48 games for the 1968 
Detroit Tigers, principally as a backup outfielder. He compiled a .125 
batting average with one triple and one home run in 48 at bats. Comer made 
an appearance in Game 5 of the 1968 World Series, getting a pinch-hit single 
off Joe Hoerner in his only at bat for a perfect 1.000 World Series batting 
average.[1] On October 15, 1968, Comer was claimed by the newly formed 
Seattle Pilots as the 41st pick in the 1968 expansion draft.[1] In 1969, 
Comer was an every day starter for the Pilots in the outfield, mostly in 
center field.[2][12] In the first year of Major League Baseball in Seattle, 
Comer led the team in runs scored with 88. He was also second on the Pilots 
in home runs with 15 (trailing Don Mincher). Comer also stole 18 bases 
for Seattle in 1969, and his combined "Power/Speed Number" was 16.4 — eighth 
best in the American League. He also led the American League in 1969 with 
six double plays turned as an outfielder. His 14 assists from the outfield 
ranked second in the American League.[1] In 1970, the Pilots moved to Milwaukee 
and became the Milwaukee Brewers. Comer appeared in 13 games for the Brewers 
and compiled an .059 batting average with one hit in 17 at bats.[1] On 
May 10, 1970, Comer was traded by the Brewers to the Washington Senators 
for Hank Allen and Ron Theobald.[13] Comer appeared in 77 games for the 
Senators, compiling a .233 batting average (.346 on-base percentage) in 
129 at bats.[1] On December 5, 1970, Comer was purchased by the Detroit 
Tigers from the Senators. He spent the 1971 season with the Toledo Mud 
Hens, appearing in 136 games with a .279 batting average (.373 on-base 
percentage).[4][14] He was called up by the Tigers for a portion of the 
1972 season, appearing in 27 games mostly as a defensive replacement in 
the outfield. He had only one hit in nine at bats for the 1972 Tigers.[1] 
Comer continued to play in the minor leagues for two more years. He played 
for the Mud Hens in 1973 and the Reading Phillies in 1974.[4][15][16] After 
retiring from baseball, Comer returned to Virginia. He served as the baseball 
coach at Spotswood High School for several years, was named Coach of the 
Year in 2000, and resigned after the 2006 season.[17][18] Comer was married 
in January 1963 to Joyce Nauman. They had three sons, Timothy Wayne (born
