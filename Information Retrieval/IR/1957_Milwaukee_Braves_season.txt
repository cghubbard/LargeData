The 1957 Milwaukee Braves season was the year that the team won its first 
and only World Series championship while based in Milwaukee. The Braves 
won 95 games and lost 59 to win the National League pennant by eight games 
over the second-place St. Louis Cardinals. The club went on to the 1957 
World Series, where they faced the New York Yankees. Pitcher Lew Burdette 
was the star and Most Valuable Player, winning three games, including the 
crucial seventh game played in New York City. The Braves finished the regular 
season with a 95–59 record, and they scored 772 runs while giving up 613. 
They played their home games in Milwaukee County Stadium, where they sold 
just over 2,220,000 tickets, tops in the National League. The Braves were 
led on offense by right fielder Hank Aaron, who won the National League 
Most Valuable Player award in just his fourth year in the major leagues. 
Fielding well in 151 games in right field, Aaron also led the National 
League with 118 runs scored, 44 home runs, a career high of 132 runs batted 
in, and 369 total bases. He also struck out just 58 times. Aaron also finished 
high in the league standings with 198 hits, a .322 batting average, and 
a .600 slugging percentage. Another offensive star was third baseman Eddie 
Mathews. On June 12, Mathews hit the 200th home run of his career.[5] For 
the season, Matthews was second on the team with 167 hits, 109 runs scored, 
32 home runs, 94 runs batted in, and 148 games played. In addition, the 
Braves' new second baseman, Red Schoendienst, was acquired in a trade on 
June 15, and he played in 93 games. Given up in this trade were Bobby Thomson 
(who was batting just .236) and Danny O'Connell (who was batting just .235). 
Wes Covington was the main replacement for Thomson in left field. Covington 
played in 96 games, batted .284, and batted in 65 runs, third on the team. 
Del Crandall was the Braves' catcher in 118 of the 154 games. Del Rice 
was his primary backup, and he played in 54 games, including pinch-hitting. 
Starting pitcher Warren Spahn was the Cy Young Award winner as the best 
pitcher in Major League Baseball, the first left-handed pitcher to win 
the award.[6] Spahn finished with 35 games started with a 21–11 record. 
He also relieved in four games, saving three of those. Spahn led the National 
League with 21 wins and 18 complete games, and he had a 2.69 earned-run 
average in 271 innings pitched. Spahn was backed up by starters Bob Buhl 
(18–7) and Lew Burdette (17–9). Fred Haney, coming off his good performance 
in 1956, managed the Braves for the entire season in 1957. Haney also led 
the Braves to the top of the regular-season standings in 1958 and 1959, 
including the 1958 World Series, but after 1959, he never managed another 
Major League team again, although he did become the general manager of 
the Los Angeles Angels. The Braves overcame two serious injuries during 
the 1957 season that caused some players to miss large parts of the year. 
First baseman Joe Adcock was injured in mid-season, and only played in 
65 games, in which he batted in 38 runs. Frank Torre filled in for him 
and batted .272 in 129 games. Center fielder Bill Bruton injured his knee 
after playing in just 79 games, missing the rest of the season. He was 
replaced by Andy Pafko, who played in 83 games. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]

This was the Braves' first World Championship since the "Miracle Braves" 
of 1914, and their only one while based in Milwaukee (out of two chances). 
To date, the Braves' only other World Championship came in the 1995 World 
Series, when the now-Atlanta Braves defeated the Cleveland Indians. World 
Series MVP Lew Burdette won two games in Yankee Stadium and one game in 
Milwaukee County Stadium. Warren Spahn had the other Braves's victory.
