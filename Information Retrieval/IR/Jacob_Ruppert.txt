Jacob (Jake) Ruppert, Jr. (August 5, 1867 – January 13, 1939) was an American 
brewer, businessman, National Guard colonel and United States Congressman 
who served for four terms representing New York from 1899 to 1907. He also 
owned the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball from 1915 until his 
death in 1939. Starting out in the family brewing business, Ruppert entered 
the United States National Guard in 1886 at the age of 19, eventually reaching 
the rank of colonel. While he was the owner of the Yankees, he purchased 
the contract of Babe Ruth and built Yankee Stadium, reversing the franchise's 
fortunes and establishing it as the premier club in the major leagues. 
Ruppert was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in July 2013.[2] 
Ruppert was born in New York City, the son of brewer Jacob Ruppert, Sr.[3] 
(1842–1915)[4] and his wife, the former Anna Gillig (1842–1924[5]). He 
was the second oldest of six children,[6] along with Cornelia Ruppert-Franko 
(1865–96), Anna Schalk (born 1870), Frank (born 1872), George (1875–1948[7]) 
and Amanda Elizabeth "Lizzie" Ruppert-Silleck (1878–1952[8]). His grandfather 
Franz (1811–83), a brewer from Bavaria, had emigrated to the United States 
in 1836 or 1842.[9] His mother was also of German ethnicity, and was herself 
the daughter of prominent brewer George Gillig.[4][10] Although he was 
a second-generation American, to the day he died he spoke with a noticeable 
German accent.[11] He grew up in the Jacob Ruppert, Sr. House on Fifth 
Avenue. Jacob Jr. attended the Columbia Grammar School. He was accepted 
into Columbia College, but instead began working in the brewing business 
with his father in 1887. He started as a barrel washer, working 12-hour 
days for $10 a week ($264 in current dollar terms),[12] and eventually 
became vice president and general manager of the brewery.[3] Ruppert enlisted 
in the Seventh Regiment, National Guard of New York, serving in the rank 
of private from 1886 through 1889. In 1890, he was promoted to colonel 
and appointed to serve on the staff of David B. Hill, the Governor of New 
York, serving as aide-de-camp.[3] He became a senior aide on the staff 
of Roswell P. Flower, Hill's successor as governor, until 1895. Ruppert 
was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1898 as a 
member of the Democratic Party to the Fifty-sixth United States Congress, 
defeating incumbent Philip B. Low of the Republican Party in New York's 
15th congressional district. He was supported in his election by Richard 
Croker, the political boss of Tammany Hall.[13] Ruppert won reelection 
over Alderman Elias Goodman in 1900.[14][15] Ruppert was renominated for 
Congress, this time running in New York's 16th congressional district, 
in 1902.[16] Ruppert was not a candidate for reelection in 1906, and he 
left office in 1907. Ruppert was also president of the Astoria Silk Works 
and the United States Brewers Association from 1911 through 1914. In January 
1914, he bought J&M Haffen Brewing Company for $700,000 ($16,565,116 in 
current dollar terms), intending to close the brewery down and develop 
the property, which was located near The Hub in The Bronx.[17] Upon his 
father's death in 1915, Ruppert inherited the Jacob Ruppert Brewing Company 
and became the company's president.[3] Ruppert also owned real estate, 
including Pass-a-Grille Key in Florida.[18] Ruppert, interested in baseball 
since his childhood, began to pursue ownership of a Major League Baseball 
team, and attempted to purchase the New York Giants on numerous occasions. 
In 1912 he was offered an opportunity to purchase the Chicago Cubs, but 
decided that Chicago was too far away from New York for his tastes.[3] 
However, Frank J. Farrell and William S. Devery, owners of the New York 
Yankees, were looking to sell their franchise. Ruppert and Tillinghast 
L'Hommedieu Huston, a former United States Army engineer and captain, purchased 
the Yankees from Farrell and Devery before the 1915 season for $480,000 
($11,246,842 in current dollar terms).[3] The Yankees were, at that time, 
a perennial also-ran in the AL, posting winning records in only 4 of their 
12 seasons – and only once since 1906 – since relocating to New York prior 
to the 1903 season. After the 1917 season, Ban Johnson, president of the 
American League (AL), suggested that Ruppert hire St. Louis Cardinals manager 
Miller Huggins to take over the same position with the Yankees. Huston, 
who was in Europe at the time that Ruppert was considering the appointment, 
disliked Huggins and wanted to hire the manager of the National League's 
crosstown Brooklyn Robins, Wilbert Robinson, his drinking buddy.[19] However, 
Ruppert interviewed Huggins on Johnson's recommendation, and agreed that 
Huggins would be an excellent choice.[19] Ruppert offered the job to Huggins, 
who accepted and signed a two-year contract.[19][20] The hiring of Huggins 
drove a wedge between the two co-owners that culminated in Huston selling 
his shares of the team to Ruppert in 1922.[21][22] Ruppert and Huston purchased 
pitcher Carl Mays from the Boston Red Sox in 1918, in direct opposition 
of an order issued by Johnson. The matter was taken to court, where Ruppert 
and Huston prevailed over Johnson. The case led to the dissolution of the 
National Commission, which governed baseball, and helped lead to the creation 
of the Commissioner of Baseball.[3] Ruppert eventually organized opposition 
to Johnson among other AL owners.[12] The Yankees purchased star pitcher-outfielder 
Babe Ruth from the Red Sox in 1919, which made the Yankees a profitable 
franchise.[3] The Yankees began to outdraw the Giants, with whom they shared 
the Polo Grounds. In 1921 the Yankees won the AL pennant for the first 
time, but lost to the Giants in the World Series. As a result of the Yankees' 
increased popularity, Charles Stoneham, owner of the Giants and the Polo 
Grounds, raised the rent for Ruppert and Huston for the 1922 season. The 
Yankee owners responded by purchasing land in The Bronx, across the Harlem 
River from the Polo Grounds, from the estate of William Waldorf Astor for 
$675,000 ($9,558,698 in current dollar terms),[23] breaking ground on a 
new stadium in May 1922. That year, the Giants once again defeated the 
Yankees in the World Series. Yankee Stadium opened on April 18, 1923,[3] 
the first ballpark with three tiers of seating for fans,[24][25] and the 
first referred to as a "stadium".[23] Ruppert and Huston financed the project 
with $2.5 million of their own money ($35,402,584 in current dollar terms).[26] 
In 1923, Ruppert bought out Huston for $1.5 million ($20,868,164 in current 
dollar terms), and he became the sole owner.[27] Later that year, the Yankees 
finally beat the Giants to win their first World Series title. The Yankees 
went on to dominate baseball throughout most of the 1920s and 1930s, winning 
three more pennants from 1926 through 1928, including the Murderers' Row 
team which won the 1927 World Series and repeated as champions the following 
year. They returned to the top with the 1932 World Series title, and then 
began their strongest period yet with the Bronx Bombers teams of the late 
1930s, becoming the first team to win three consecutive World Series titles 
in 1936, 1937 and 1938. In 1937, the Yankees became the first team to win 
six World Series titles, and in 1938 they surpassed the Philadelphia Athletics 
to become the first team to win ten AL championships, with only the Giants 
winning more pennants in the 20th century. In 1929, Ruppert added numbers 
to the Yankees' uniforms, which became a feature of every team. He said, 
"Many fans do not attend games on a regular basis and cannot easily pick 
out the players they have come to see."[28] in 1931 Ruppert bought the 
Newark Bears who played at Ruppert Stadium in Newark, New Jersey, and begin 
building the farm system for the Yankees.[29] Ruppert's 24 years as a Yankee 
owner saw him build the team from near-moribund to a baseball powerhouse. 
His own strength as a baseball executive – including his willingness to 
wheel and deal – was aided by the business skills of general manager Ed 
Barrow and the forceful field managing of Miller Huggins, until his sudden 
death at age 50 late in the 1929 season, and Joe McCarthy, beginning in 
1931. By the time of Ruppert's death, the team was well on its way to becoming 
the most successful in the history of Major League Baseball, and eventually 
in North American professional sports. Ruppert and Ruth had public disagreements 
about Ruth's contracts.[30] Nevertheless, they were personal friends; according 
to Ruth, Ruppert called him "Babe" only once, and that was the night before 
he died. Usually, Ruppert called him "Root" (as "Ruth" sounded in his German-accented 
voice); he always called everyone, even close friends, by their last name. 
Ruth was one of the last persons to see Ruppert alive.[11] Ruppert suffered 
from phlebitis in April 1938, and was confined to his Fifth Avenue apartment 
for most of the year. He was too sick to follow the Yankees to the 1938 
World Series, what would be their seventh world title under his stewardship; 
he listened on the radio. In November 1938, he checked into Lenox Hill 
Hospital, where he died on January 13, 1939.[11][31] He was survived by 
his brother George and his sister Amanda, and was interred in the family 
mausoleum at Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York. Ruppert resided at Eagle's 
Rest, an estate in Garrison, New York. In 1894, he purchased South Brother 
Island, located in the East River, and was the last person to live on the 
island, leaving in 1909 when his house burned down.[32][33] Ruppert's father, 
Jacob, Sr., left behind an estate of $6,382,758 ($110,470,539 in current 
dollar terms) when he died in 1915,[34] which Ruppert increased to $40 
million by the time of his death in 1939.[35] This was managed by his heirs.[3] 
His brother George, who served as the Yankees' vice president, declined 
to take over the team presidency, and instead recommended that general 
manager Ed Barrow be given control of the club. Under Barrow's leadership, 
the Yankees won a fourth consecutive World Series in 1939, and captured 
three more AL titles and two World Series from 1941 to 1943 as the nation 
entered World War II. After mismanaging Ruppert's brewery, the heirs sold 
the Yankees to Dan Topping, Del Webb and Larry MacPhail in 1945. The brewery 
sold its flagship beer, Knickerbocker beer, to Rheingold, and went out 
of business in 1965.[3] On April 16, 1940, the Yankees dedicated a plaque 
in Ruppert's memory, to hang on the center field wall of Yankee Stadium, 
near the flagpole and the monument that had been dedicated to former manager 
Miller Huggins.[36] The plaque called Ruppert "Gentleman, American, sportsman, 
through whose vision and courage this imposing edifice, destined to become 
the home of champions, was erected and dedicated to the American game of 
baseball." The plaque now rests in Monument Park at New Yankee Stadium.[37] 
An apocryphal story says that Ruppert is responsible for the Yankees' famous 
pinstriped uniforms; according to this account, Ruppert chose pinstripes 
in order to make the often-portly Ruth appear less obese, but the uniform 
was in fact introduced in 1912.[38] A beer was named after Ruppert,[39] 
as were Ruppert Stadium in Newark, New Jersey. Ruppert Park in Manhattan.[40] 
is part of the Ruppert Yorkville Towers housing complex was built on the 
site the brewery in Yorkville, Manhattan.[41] On December 3, 2012, Ruppert 
was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the new Pre-Integration 
Era Committee, which considers candidates (managers, umpires, executives, 
and players) every three years that have been identified by the Baseball 
Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) appointed Historical Overview Committee 
from the era prior to 1947.[42] He was inducted into the Hall on July 28, 
2013.[43][44] His induction speech was given by his great-grandniece Anne 
Vernon, the great-granddaughter of Ruppert's brother George.[45]  This
