The Danville Leafs were a professional minor league baseball team that 
played in the city of Danville, Virginia. Professional baseball first made 
its appearance in Danville in 1905 when the town fielded a team, the Tobacconists, 
in the short-lived Virginia-North Carolina League. Several other professional 
teams came and went in the town and it wasn't until 1925 that the name 
"Leafs" was first used. The name refers to the famous tobacco leaf markets 
of the town. The Leafs, who played in the Piedmont League, relocated during 
the 1926 season, again leaving Danville without professional baseball. 
A new Leafs team was formed in 1934 as a member of the Class D Bi-State 
League. The team remained a part of that league, which included teams from 
towns along both sides of the North Carolina-Virginia border, for five 
seasons. The Leafs won pennants in 1934 and '35. In 1945, another incarnation 
of the Danville Leafs took the field as members of the newly formed Carolina 
League. They were a member of the New York Giants (San Francisco Giants) 
farm system. The team existed through the 1958 season. In 1945, Danville 
pitcher Art Fowler led the league with 23 wins. He went on to have a long 
major league career as both a player and coach. In 1953, Leafs' pitcher 
Ramon Monzant (23-6, 232 strikeouts) won the Carolina League MVP award. 
He went on to spend a few seasons with the Giants. Willie McCovey played 
first base for the 1956 Danville Leafs. He hit .310 with 29 home runs and 
89 RBIs. One of his teammates that season, outfielder Leon Wagner (.330, 
51 home runs, 166 RBIs), also had an outstanding big league career. The 
team was the first in the Carolina League to become racially integrated 
when Percy Miller Jr. joined the team in 1951. Professional baseball returned 
to Danville in 1993 when the Pulaski Braves of the rookie level Appalachian 
League relocated to Danville as the Danville Braves. A farm team of the 
Atlanta Braves, the team has been the starting point for many players who
