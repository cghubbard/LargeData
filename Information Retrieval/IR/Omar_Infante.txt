Omar Rafael Infante [in-FAHN-tay] (born December 26, 1981) is a Venezuelan 
professional baseball second baseman who is a free agent. He has played 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers, Atlanta Braves, 
Miami Marlins, and Kansas City Royals. He was an All-Star in 2010. While 
primarily a second baseman, he has experience at every position except 
for pitcher, catcher, and first base. Infante made his major league debut 
with the Detroit Tigers on September 7, 2002. entered the 2003 season as 
the starting shortstop for the Detroit Tigers. Ramón Santiago, considered 
a better glove-man started the season at second base. Considered two of 
the Tigers better prospects, both proved overmatched; Infante hit .222 
with no home runs and eight RBIs in over 200 at-bats. In 2004, Infante 
lost any chance to claim the starting shortstop role when the Tigers acquired 
Carlos Guillén, who went on to be an All-Star that year (Santiago had been 
included in the trade for Guillén). With Guillén at shortstop and free 
agent acquisition Fernando Viña at second base, Infante was likely to spend 
much of the season in the minors. Then he received an opportunity in mid-May 
to play every day at second base when Viña was sidelined for the year by 
a hamstring injury. He responded by playing solid defense and hitting .264 
with 16 home runs and 55 RBIs in 142 games. Infante's rebound in 2004 fueled 
speculation that he may one day become a star at second base. In 2005, 
however, he regressed, and the Tigers sought his replacement. In June of 
that year, the Tigers traded for Plácido Polanco, who had been filling 
a utility role with the Philadelphia Phillies. Polanco became the starting 
second baseman, and Infante moved to the bench. Following his move to the 
bench, Infante played seven different positions during the 2007 season. 
On November 12, 2007 Infante was traded to the Chicago Cubs for Jacque 
Jones.[1] On December 4, 2007 Infante was traded again, this time along 
with Will Ohman to the Atlanta Braves for José Ascanio.[2] A Cub for less 
than a month during the off-season, Infante never appeared in a game. On 
January 12, 2009, Infante signed a two-year contract worth $4.3 million 
with the Atlanta Braves.[3] National League manager Charlie Manuel selected 
Infante to the 2010 National League All-Star Team, earning Infante his 
first selection after proving to be one of the most valuable utility men 
in the National League. Infante was one of six Braves on the All-Star team. 
After the 2010 season, Infante and reliever Michael Dunn were traded to 
the Florida Marlins for second baseman Dan Uggla.[4] On September 27, 2011, 
it was announced that Infante and the Marlins had agreed on a two-year 
extension, worth around $8 million.[5] In 2011, Infante lead the Majors 
in fielding assists. On June 21, 2012, Infante played in his 1000th game 
against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. Infante and Aníbal Sánchez were 
traded by the Marlins to the Tigers, on July 23, 2012, for Jacob Turner, 
Rob Brantly, and Brian Flynn.[6] In Game 4 of the 2012 World Series on 
October 28, 2012, Infante suffered a broken left hand after being hit by 
a pitch. Omar had a stellar 2013 season for the Tigers, despite spending 
over a month on the disabled list with a lower leg injury. He hit .318, 
his highest batting average since his career best .321 in 2010 with the 
Braves along with 10 home runs and 51 RBI. He also posted the highest slugging 
percentage of his career (.450). On December 16, 2013, Infante signed a 
four-year, $30.25 million contract with the Kansas City Royals, with a 
club option for 2018.[7] After struggling in the post season, on October 
22, 2014 Infante hit a 2 run home run against the San Francisco Giants 
in the bottom of the 6th inning in a 5 run inning to lift the Royals past 
the Giants in a 7–2 victory. During the 2015 season, Infante took part 
in many defensive gems while teaming with Gold Glove shortstop Alcides 
Escobar, and also experienced an offensive highlight by knocking in a career-high 
seven runs against the Cleveland Indians on September 18, 2015. But Infante 
lost his starting job for the latter part of the 2015 season after the 
Royals acquired Ben Zobrist before the trade deadline. Infante played only 
sparingly as the Royals won the ALDS, the ALCS, and the World Series in 
2015. After hitting just .238 in parts of three injury-riddled seasons 
with the Royals, Infante was designated for assignment on June 15, 2016. 
He was currently second in the all-star ballot at the time of his release.[8] 
He cleared waivers and became a free agent on June 23.[9] On June 30, 2016, 
Infante agreed to a minor league deal with the Atlanta Braves.[10] He was
