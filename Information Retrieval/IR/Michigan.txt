Michigan i/ˈmɪʃᵻɡən/ is a state located in the Great Lakes and Midwestern 
regions of the United States. The name Michigan is the French form of the 
Ojibwa word mishigamaa, meaning "large water" or "large lake".[2][b] Michigan 
is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most 
extensive total area (the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi 
River).[c] Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit. Michigan 
is the only state to consist of two peninsulas. The Lower Peninsula, to 
which the name Michigan was originally applied, is often noted to be shaped 
like a mitten. The Upper Peninsula (often referred to as "the U.P.") is 
separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac, a five-mile 
(8 km) channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan. The two peninsulas 
are connected by the Mackinac Bridge. The state has the longest freshwater 
coastline of any political subdivision in the world, being bounded by four 
of the five Great Lakes, plus Lake Saint Clair.[6] As a result, it is one 
of the leading U.S. states for recreational boating.[7] Michigan also has 
64,980 inland lakes and ponds.[8] A person in the state is never more than 
six miles (9.7 km) from a natural water source or more than 85 miles (137 km) 
from a Great Lakes shoreline.[9] What is now Michigan was first settled 
by various Native American tribes before being colonized by French explorers 
in the 17th century and becoming a part of New France. After the defeat 
of France in the French and Indian War in 1762 the region came under British 
rule, and was finally ceded to the newly independent United States after 
the British defeat in the American Revolutionary War. The area was organized 
as part of the larger Northwest Territory until 1800, when western Michigan 
became part of the Indiana Territory. Eventually, in 1805, the Michigan 
Territory was formed, which lasted until it was admitted into the Union 
on January 26, 1837, as the 26th state. The state of Michigan soon became 
an important center of industry and trade in the Great Lakes region and 
a popular immigrant destination. Though Michigan has come to develop a 
diverse economy, it is widely known as the center of the U.S. automotive 
industry, being home to the country's three major automobile companies 
(whose headquarters are all located within the Detroit metropolitan area). 
While sparsely populated, the Upper Peninsula is economically important 
due to its status as a tourist destination as well as its abundance of 
natural resources, while the Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing, 
services, and high-tech industry. When the first European explorers arrived, 
the most populous tribes were Algonquian peoples, which include the Anishinaabe 
groups of Ojibwe (called "Chippewa" in French), Odaawaa/Odawa (Ottawa), 
and the Boodewaadamii/Bodéwadmi (Potawatomi). The three nations co-existed 
peacefully as part of a loose confederation called the Council of Three 
Fires. The Ojibwe, whose numbers are estimated to have been between 25,000 
and 35,000, were the largest. The Ojibwe were established in Michigan's 
Upper Peninsula and northern and central Michigan, and also inhabited Ontario, 
northern Wisconsin, southern Manitoba, and northern and north-central Minnesota. 
The Ottawa lived primarily south of the Straits of Mackinac in northern, 
western and southern Michigan, but also in southern Ontario, northern Ohio 
and eastern Wisconsin, while the Potawatomi were in southern and western 
Michigan, in addition to northern and central Indiana, northern Illinois, 
southern Wisconsin and southern Ontario. Other Algonquian tribes in Michigan, 
in the south and east, were the Mascouten, the Menominee, the Miami, the 
Sac (or Sauk), and the Fox, and the non-Algonquian Wyandot, who are better 
known by their French name, the Huron. French voyageurs and coureurs des 
bois explored and settled in Michigan in the 17th century. The first Europeans 
to reach what later became Michigan were those of Étienne Brûlé's expedition 
in 1622. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1668 on 
the site where Père Jacques Marquette established Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan 
as a base for Catholic missions.[10][11] Missionaries in 1671–75 founded 
outlying stations at Saint Ignace and Marquette. Jesuit missionaries were 
well received by the Indian populations in the area, with relatively few 
difficulties or hostilities. In 1679, Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle 
built Fort Miami at present-day St. Joseph. In 1691, the French established 
a trading post and Fort St. Joseph along the St. Joseph River at the present 
day city of Niles. In 1701, French explorer and army officer Antoine de 
la Mothe Cadillac founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit or "Fort Pontchartrain 
on-the-Strait" on the strait, known as the Detroit River, between lakes 
Saint Clair and Erie. Cadillac had convinced King Louis XIV's chief minister, 
Louis Phélypeaux, Comte de Pontchartrain, that a permanent community there 
would strengthen French control over the upper Great Lakes and discourage 
British aspirations. The hundred soldiers and workers who accompanied Cadillac 
built a fort enclosing one arpent[12][13] (about 0.85 acres (3,400 m2), 
the equivalent of just under 200 feet (61 m) per side) and named it Fort 
Pontchartrain. Cadillac's wife, Marie Thérèse Guyon, soon moved to Detroit, 
becoming one of the first European women to settle in the Michigan wilderness. 
The town quickly became a major fur-trading and shipping post. The Église 
de Saint-Anne (Church of Saint Ann) was founded the same year. While the 
original building does not survive, the congregation of that name continues 
to be active today. Cadillac later departed to serve as the French governor 
of Louisiana from 1710 to 1716. French attempts to consolidate the fur 
trade led to the Fox Wars involving the Meskwaki (Fox) and their allies 
versus the French and their Native allies. At the same time, the French 
strengthened Fort Michilimackinac at the Straits of Mackinac to better 
control their lucrative fur-trading empire. By the mid-18th century, the 
French also occupied forts at present-day Niles and Sault Ste. Marie, though 
most of the rest of the region remained unsettled by Europeans. France 
offered free land in an effort to attract families to Detroit, which grew 
to 800 people in 1765, the largest city between Montreal and New Orleans.[14] 
From 1660 until the end of French rule, Michigan was part of the Royal 
Province of New France.[d] In 1760, Montreal fell to the British forces 
ending the French and Indian War (1754–1763). Under the 1763 Treaty of 
Paris, Michigan and the rest of New France east of the Mississippi River 
passed to Great Britain.[15] After the Quebec Act was passed in 1774, Michigan 
became part of the British Province of Quebec. By 1778, Detroit's population 
was up to 2,144 and it was the third largest city in Quebec.[16] During 
the American Revolutionary War, Detroit was an important British supply 
center. Most of the inhabitants were French-Canadians or Native Americans, 
many of whom had been allied with the French. Because of imprecise cartography 
and unclear language defining the boundaries in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, 
the British retained control of Detroit and Michigan after the American 
Revolution. When Quebec split into Lower and Upper Canada in 1791, Michigan 
was part of Kent County, Upper Canada. It held its first democratic elections 
in August 1792 to send delegates to the new provincial parliament at Newark 
(now Niagara-on-the-Lake).[17] Under terms negotiated in the 1794 Jay Treaty, 
Britain withdrew from Detroit and Michilimackinac in 1796. Questions remained 
over the boundary for many years, and the United States did not have uncontested 
control of the Upper Peninsula and Drummond Island until 1818 and 1847, 
respectively. During the War of 1812, Michigan Territory (effectively consisting 
of Detroit and the surrounding area) was surrendered after a nearly bloodless 
siege in 1812. An attempt to retake Detroit resulted in a severe American 
defeat in the River Raisin Massacre. This battle is still the bloodiest 
ever fought in the state and had the highest number of American casualties 
of any battle in the war. Ultimately, Michigan was recaptured by Americans 
in 1813 after the Battle of Lake Erie. An invasion of Canada which culminated 
in the Battle of the Thames was then launched from Michigan. The more northern 
areas were held by the British until the peace treaty restored the old 
boundaries. A number of forts, including Fort Wayne were built in Michigan 
during the 19th century out of fears of renewed fighting with Britain. 
The population grew slowly until the opening in 1825 of the Erie Canal 
connecting the Great Lakes and the Hudson River and New York City. The 
new route brought a large influx of settlers, who became farmers and merchants 
and shipped out grain, lumber, and iron ore. By the 1830s, Michigan had 
80,000 residents, more than enough to apply and qualify for statehood. 
A Constitutional Convention of Assent, led by Gershom Mott Williams, was 
held to lead the territory to statehood.[18] In October 1835 the people 
approved the Constitution of 1835, thereby forming a state government, 
although Congressional recognition was delayed pending resolution of a 
boundary dispute with Ohio known as the Toledo War. Congress awarded the 
"Toledo Strip" to Ohio. Michigan received the western part of the Upper 
Peninsula as a concession and formally entered the Union on January 26, 
1837. The Upper Peninsula proved to be a rich source of lumber, iron, and 
copper. Michigan led the nation in lumber production from the 1850s to 
the 1880s. Railroads became a major engine of growth from the 1850s onward, 
with Detroit the chief hub. A second wave of French Canadian immigrants 
settled in Michigan during the late 19th to early 20th century, particularly 
in lumbering areas in counties on the Lake Huron side of the Lower Peninsula, 
such as the Saginaw Valley, Alpena, and Cheboygan counties as well as throughout 
the Upper Peninsula with large concentrations in Escanaba and the Keweenaw 
Peninsula.[19] The first statewide meeting of the Republican Party took 
place July 6, 1854, in Jackson, Michigan, where the party adopted its platform. 
The state was heavily Republican until the 1930s. Michigan made a significant 
contribution to the Union in the American Civil War and sent more than 
forty regiments of volunteers to the federal armies. Modernizers and boosters 
set up systems for public education, including founding the University 
of Michigan (1817; moved to Ann Arbor in 1837), for a classical academic 
education; and Michigan State Normal School, (1849) now Eastern Michigan 
University, for the training of teachers. In 1899, it became the first 
normal college in the nation to offer a four-year curriculum. Michigan 
Agricultural College (1855), now Michigan State University in East Lansing, 
was founded as the pioneer land-grant college, a model for those authorized 
under the Morrill Act (1862). Many other private colleges were founded 
as well, and the smaller cities formed high schools late in the century.[20] 
Michigan's economy underwent a transformation at the turn of the 20th century. 
Many individuals, including Ransom E. Olds, John and Horace Dodge, Henry 
Leland, David Dunbar Buick, Henry Joy, Charles King, and Henry Ford, provided 
the concentration of engineering know-how and technological enthusiasm 
to start the birth of the automotive industry.[21] Ford's development of 
the moving assembly line in Highland Park marked the beginning of a new 
era in transportation. Like the steamship and railroad, it was a far-reaching 
development. More than the forms of public transportation, the automobile 
transformed private life. It became the major industry of Detroit and Michigan, 
and permanently altered the socio-economic life of the United States and 
much of the world. With the growth, the auto industry created jobs in Detroit 
that attracted immigrants from Europe and migrants from across the United 
States, including those from the South. By 1920, Detroit was the fourth-largest 
city in the US. Residential housing was in short supply, and it took years 
for the market to catch up with the population boom. By the 1930s, so many 
immigrants had arrived that more than 30 languages were spoken in the public 
schools, and ethnic communities celebrated in annual heritage festivals. 
Over the years immigrants and migrants contributed greatly to Detroit's 
diverse urban culture, including popular music trends, such as the influential 
Motown Sound of the 1960s led by a variety of individual singers and groups. 
Grand Rapids, the second-largest city in Michigan, is also an important 
center of manufacturing. Since 1838, the city has also been noted for its 
furniture industry and is home to five of the world's leading office furniture 
companies. Grand Rapids is home to a number of major companies including 
Steelcase, Amway, and Meijer. Grand Rapids is also an important center 
for GE Aviation Systems. Michigan held its first United States presidential 
primary election in 1910. With its rapid growth in industry, it was an 
important center of union industry-wide organizing, such as the rise of 
the United Auto Workers. In 1920 WWJ (AM) in Detroit became the first radio 
station in the United States to regularly broadcast commercial programs. 
Throughout that decade, some of the country's largest and most ornate skyscrapers 
were built in the city. Particularly noteworthy are the Fisher Building, 
Cadillac Place, and the Guardian Building, each of which is a National 
Historic Landmark (NHL). In 1927 a school bombing took place in Clinton 
County; the Bath School disaster, which resulted in the deaths of 38 schoolchildren, 
constitutes the deadliest mass murder in a school in U.S. history. Michigan 
manufactured 10.9 percent of total United States military armaments produced 
during World War II, ranking second (behind New York) among the 48 states.[22] 
Detroit continued to expand through the 1950s, at one point doubling its 
population in a decade. After World War II, housing was developed in suburban 
areas outside city cores; newly constructed U.S. Interstate Highways allowed 
commuters to navigate the region more easily. Modern advances in the auto 
industry have resulted in increased automation, high tech industry, and 
increased suburban growth since 1960. Michigan is the leading auto-producing 
state in the US, with the industry primarily located throughout the Midwestern 
United States, Ontario, Canada, and the Southern United States.[23] With 
almost ten million residents, Michigan is a large and influential state, 
ranking tenth in population among the fifty states. Detroit is the centrally 
located metropolitan area of the Great Lakes Megalopolis and the second-largest 
metropolitan area in the U.S. linking the Great Lakes system. The Metro 
Detroit area in Southeast Michigan is the largest metropolitan area in 
the state (roughly 50% of the population resides there) and the eleventh 
largest in the USA. The Grand Rapids metropolitan area in Western Michigan 
is the fastest-growing metro area in the state, with over 1.3 million residents 
as of 2006. Metro Detroit receives more than 15 million visitors each year. 
Michigan has many popular tourist destinations which include areas such 
as Frankenmuth in The Thumb, and Traverse City on the Grand Traverse Bay 
in Northern Michigan. Tourists spend about $17 billion annually in Michigan 
supporting 193,000 jobs.[24] Michigan typically ranks third or fourth in 
overall Research & development (R&D) expenditures in the US.[25][26] The 
state's leading research institutions include the University of Michigan, 
Michigan State University and Wayne State University which are important 
partners in the state's economy and the state's University Research Corridor.[27] 
Michigan's public universities attract more than $1.5 B in research and 
development grants each year.[28] Agriculture also serves a significant 
role making the state a leading grower of fruit in the US, including blueberries, 
cherries, apples, grapes and peaches.[29] Michigan is governed as a republic, 
with three branches of government: the executive branch consisting of the 
Governor of Michigan and the other independently elected constitutional 
officers; the legislative branch consisting of the House of Representatives 
and Senate; and the judicial branch. The Michigan Constitution allows for 
the direct participation of the electorate by statutory initiative and 
referendum, recall, and constitutional initiative and referral (Article 
II, § 9,[30] defined as "the power to propose laws and to enact and reject 
laws, called the initiative, and the power to approve or reject laws enacted 
by the legislature, called the referendum. The power of initiative extends 
only to laws which the legislature may enact under this constitution"). 
Lansing is the state capital and is home to all three branches of state 
government. The governor and the other state constitutional officers serve 
four-year terms and may be re-elected only once. The current governor is 
Rick Snyder. Michigan has two official Governor's Residences; one is in 
Lansing, and the other is at Mackinac Island. The other constitutionally 
elected executive officers are the lieutenant governor, who is elected 
on a joint ticket with the governor, the secretary of state, and the attorney 
general. The lieutenant governor presides over the Senate, but only voting 
when ties occur, and is also a member of the cabinet. The secretary of 
state is the chief elections officer and is charged with running many licensure 
programs including motor vehicles, all of which are done through the branch 
offices of the secretary of state. The Michigan Legislature consists of 
a 38-member Senate and 110-member House of Representatives. Members of 
both houses of the legislature are elected through first past the post 
elections by single-member electoral districts of near-equal population 
that often have boundaries which coincide with county and municipal lines. 
Senators serve four-year terms concurrent to those of the governor, while 
representatives serve two-year terms. The Michigan State Capitol was dedicated 
in 1879 and has hosted the executive and legislative branches of the state 
ever since. The Michigan judiciary consists of two courts with primary 
jurisdiction (the Circuit Courts and the District Courts), one intermediate 
level appellate court (the Michigan Court of Appeals), and the Michigan 
Supreme Court. There are several administrative courts and specialized 
courts. District courts are trial courts of limited jurisdiction, handling 
most traffic violations, small claims, misdemeanors, and civil suits where 
the amount contended is below $25,000. District courts are often responsible 
for handling the preliminary examination and for setting bail in felony 
cases. District court judges are elected to terms of six years. In a few 
locations, municipal courts have been retained to the exclusion of the 
establishment of district courts. There are 57 circuit courts in the State 
of Michigan, which have original jurisdiction over all civil suits where 
the amount contended in the case exceeds $25,000 and all criminal cases 
involving felonies. Circuit courts are also the only trial courts in the 
State of Michigan which possess the power to issue equitable remedies. 
Circuit courts have appellate jurisdiction from district and municipal 
courts, as well as from decisions and decrees of state agencies. Most counties 
have their own circuit court, but sparsely populated counties often share 
them. Circuit court judges are elected to terms of six years. State appellate 
court judges are elected to terms of six years, but vacancies are filled 
by an appointment by the governor. There are four divisions of the Court 
of Appeals, being located in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Lansing, and Marquette. 
Cases are heard by the Court of Appeals by panels of three judges, who 
examine the application of the law and not the facts of the case, unless 
there has been grievous error pertaining to questions of fact. The Michigan 
Supreme Court consists of seven members who are elected on non-partisan 
ballots for staggered eight-year terms. The Supreme Court has original 
jurisdiction only in narrow circumstances, but holds appellate jurisdiction 
over the entire state judicial system. Michigan has had four constitutions, 
the first of which was ratified on October 5 and 6, 1835.[31] There were 
also constitutions from 1850 and 1908, in addition to the current constitution 
from 1963. The current document has a preamble, 11 articles, and one section 
consisting of a schedule and temporary provisions. Michigan, like every 
U.S. state except Louisiana, has a common law legal system. Voters in the 
state elect candidates from both major parties. Economic issues are important 
in Michigan elections. The three-term Republican Governor John Engler (1991–2003) 
preceded the former two-term Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm (2003–2011). 
The state has elected successive Republican attorneys general twice since 
2003. The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both the House 
and Senate of the Michigan Legislature. Michigan supported the election 
of Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. The current 
Governor Rick Snyder (2011–present) is a Republican. However, the state 
has supported Democrats in the last six presidential election cycles. In 
2012, Barack Obama carried the state over Mitt Romney, winning Michigan's 
17 electoral votes with 54% of the vote. Michigan's two U.S. Senators are 
both Democrats, while Republicans hold nine of the state's fourteen US 
House seats. Michigan's current senior U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow, a 
Democrat, has served since 2001 after narrowly beating former Republican 
U.S. Senator Spencer Abraham in the 2000 elections. Democratic U.S. Senator 
Gary Peters was elected in 2014, beating former Republican Michigan Secretary 
of State Terri Lynn Land. Congressman Fred Upton, a Republican, serves 
as Chairman of the US House Committee on Energy and Commerce and Congressman 
Mike Rogers, also a Republican, serves as Chairman of US House Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence. Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, a Democrat, 
became the first person to succeed a living spouse when she replaced former 
Dean of the House of Representatives John Dingell in 2015. As of 2014, 
the partisan split in Michigan is 44-37, with Democrats in the majority. 
Republican strongholds of the state include rural areas of Western Michigan, 
Northern Michigan, Livingston County, and the Grand Rapids metro area. 
Suburban Detroit, which includes Oakland, Macomb, and a large portion of 
Wayne has a mixed voting history. Democratic strongholds include Wayne 
County, which includes the city of Detroit, Washtenaw County (Ann Arbor), 
Ingham County (Lansing), and Genesee County (Flint). Historically, the 
first county-level meeting of the Republican Party took place in Jackson 
on July 6, 1854,[32] and the party thereafter dominated Michigan until 
the Great Depression. In the 1912 election, Michigan was one of the six 
states to support progressive Republican and third-party candidate Theodore 
Roosevelt for president after he lost the Republican nomination to William 
Howard Taft. Michigan remained fairly reliably Republican at the presidential 
level for much of the 20th century. It was part of Greater New England, 
the northern tier of states settled chiefly by migrants from New England 
who carried their culture with them. The state was one of only a handful 
to back Wendell Willkie over Franklin Roosevelt in 1940, and supported 
Thomas E. Dewey in his losing bid against Harry S. Truman in 1948. Michigan 
went to the Democrats in presidential elections during the 1960s, and voted 
for Republican Richard Nixon in 1972. Michigan was the home of Gerald Ford, 
the 38th President of the United States. He was born in Nebraska and moved 
as an infant to Grand Rapids and grew up there.[33][34] The Gerald R. Ford 
Museum is located in Grand Rapids, and the Gerald R. Ford Presidential 
Library is located on the campus of his alma mater, the University of Michigan 
in Ann Arbor. In 1846 Michigan became the first state in the Union, as 
well as the first English-speaking government in the world,[35][36] to 
abolish the death penalty. Historian David Chardavoyne has suggested that 
the movement to abolish capital punishment in Michigan grew as a result 
of enmity toward the state's neighbor, Canada. Under British rule, it made 
public executions a regular practice. Michigan has recognized and performed 
same-sex marriages since June 26, 2015, following the Supreme Court ruling 
in Obergefell v. Hodges.[37] Previously, such unions were prohibited under 
a 2004 state constitutional amendment.[38] Michigan has approved plans 
to expand Medicaid coverage in 2014 to adults with incomes up to 133% of 
the federal poverty level (approximately $15,500 for a single adult in 
2014).[39] State government is decentralized among three tiers—statewide, 
county and township. Counties are administrative divisions of the state, 
and townships are administrative divisions of a county. Both of them exercise 
state government authority, localized to meet the particular needs of their 
jurisdictions, as provided by state law. There are 83 counties in Michigan. 
Cities, state universities, and villages are vested with home rule powers 
of varying degrees. Home rule cities can generally do anything that is 
not prohibited by law. The fifteen state universities have broad power 
and can do anything within the parameters of their status as educational 
institutions that is not prohibited by the state constitution. Villages, 
by contrast, have limited home rule and are not completely autonomous from 
the county and township in which they are located. There are two types 
of township in Michigan: general law township and charter. Charter township 
status was created by the Legislature in 1947 and grants additional powers 
and stream-lined administration in order to provide greater protection 
against annexation by a city. As of April 2001, there were 127 charter 
townships in Michigan. In general, charter townships have many of the same 
powers as a city but without the same level of obligations. For example, 
a charter township can have its own fire department, water and sewer department, 
police department, and so on—just like a city—but it is not required to 
have those things, whereas cities must provide those services. Charter 
townships can opt to use county-wide services instead, such as deputies 
from the county sheriff's office instead of a home-based force of ordinance 
officers. Michigan consists of two peninsulas that lie between 82°30' to 
about 90°30' west longitude, and are separated by the Straits of Mackinac. 
The 45th parallel north runs through the state - marked by highway signs 
and the Polar-Equator Trail[40] - along a line including Mission Point 
Light near Traverse City, the towns of Gaylord and Alpena in the Lower 
Peninsula and Menominee in the Upper Peninsula. With the exception of two 
small areas that are drained by the Mississippi River by way of the Wisconsin 
River in the Upper Peninsula and by way of the Kankakee-Illinois River 
in the Lower Peninsula, Michigan is drained by the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence 
watershed and is the only state with the majority of its land thus drained. 
The Great Lakes that border Michigan from east to west are Lake Erie, Lake 
Huron, Lake Michigan and Lake Superior. It has more public golf courses, 
registered boats, and lighthouses than any other state. The state is bounded 
on the south by the states of Ohio and Indiana, sharing land and water 
boundaries with both. Michigan's western boundaries are almost entirely 
water boundaries, from south to north, with Illinois and Wisconsin in Lake 
Michigan; then a land boundary with Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula, 
that is principally demarcated by the Menominee and Montreal Rivers; then 
water boundaries again, in Lake Superior, with Wisconsin and Minnesota 
to the west, capped around by the Canadian province of Ontario to the north 
and east. The heavily forested Upper Peninsula is relatively mountainous 
in the west. The Porcupine Mountains, which are part of one of the oldest 
mountain chains in the world,[41] rise to an altitude of almost 2,000 feet 
(610 m) above sea level and form the watershed between the streams flowing 
into Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. The surface on either side of this 
range is rugged. The state's highest point, in the Huron Mountains northwest 
of Marquette, is Mount Arvon at 1,979 feet (603 m). The peninsula is as 
large as Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island combined 
but has fewer than 330,000 inhabitants. They are sometimes called "Yoopers" 
(from "U.P.'ers"), and their speech (the "Yooper dialect") has been heavily 
influenced by the numerous Scandinavian and Canadian immigrants who settled 
the area during the lumbering and mining boom of the late 19th century. 
The Lower Peninsula is shaped like a mitten and many residents hold up 
a hand to depict where they are from.[42] It is 277 miles (446 km) long 
from north to south and 195 miles (314 km) from east to west and occupies 
nearly two-thirds of the state's land area. The surface of the peninsula 
is generally level, broken by conical hills and glacial moraines usually 
not more than a few hundred feet tall. It is divided by a low water divide 
running north and south. The larger portion of the state is on the west 
of this and gradually slopes toward Lake Michigan. The highest point in 
the Lower Peninsula is either Briar Hill at 1,705 feet (520 m), or one 
of several points nearby in the vicinity of Cadillac. The lowest point 
is the surface of Lake Erie at 571 feet (174 m). The geographic orientation 
of Michigan's peninsulas makes for a long distance between the ends of 
the state. Ironwood, in the far western Upper Peninsula, lies 630 highway 
miles (1,015 km) from Lambertville in the Lower Peninsula's southeastern 
corner. The geographic isolation of the Upper Peninsula from Michigan's 
political and population centers makes the U.P. culturally and economically 
distinct. Occasionally U.P. residents have called for secession from Michigan 
and establishment as a new state to be called "Superior". A feature of 
Michigan that gives it the distinct shape of a mitten is the Thumb. This 
peninsula projects out into Lake Huron and the Saginaw Bay. The geography 
of the Thumb is mainly flat with a few rolling hills. Other peninsulas 
of Michigan include the Keweenaw Peninsula, making up the Copper Country 
region of the state. The Leelanau Peninsula lies in the Northern Lower 
Michigan region. See Also Michigan Regions Numerous lakes and marshes mark 
both peninsulas, and the coast is much indented. Keweenaw Bay, Whitefish 
Bay, and the Big and Little Bays De Noc are the principal indentations 
on the Upper Peninsula. The Grand and Little Traverse, Thunder, and Saginaw 
bays indent the Lower Peninsula. Michigan has the second longest shoreline 
of any state—3,288 miles (5,292 km),[43] including 1,056 miles (1,699 km) 
of island shoreline.[44] The state has numerous large islands, the principal 
ones being the North Manitou and South Manitou, Beaver, and Fox groups 
in Lake Michigan; Isle Royale and Grande Isle in Lake Superior; Marquette, 
Bois Blanc, and Mackinac islands in Lake Huron; and Neebish, Sugar, and 
Drummond islands in St. Mary's River. Michigan has about 150 lighthouses, 
the most of any U.S. state. The first lighthouses in Michigan were built 
between 1818 and 1822. They were built to project light at night and to 
serve as a landmark during the day to safely guide the passenger ships 
and freighters traveling the Great Lakes. See Lighthouses in the United 
States. The state's rivers are generally small, short and shallow, and 
few are navigable. The principal ones include the Detroit River, St. Marys 
River, and St. Clair River which connect the Great Lakes; the Au Sable, 
Cheboygan, and Saginaw, which flow into Lake Huron; the Ontonagon, and 
Tahquamenon, which flow into Lake Superior; and the St. Joseph, Kalamazoo, 
Grand, Muskegon, Manistee, and Escanaba, which flow into Lake Michigan. 
The state has 11,037 inland lakes - totaling 1,305 square miles (3,380 km2) 
of inland water - in addition to 38,575 square miles (99,910 km2) of Great 
Lakes waters. No point in Michigan is more than six miles (10 km) from 
an inland lake or more than 85 miles (137 km) from one of the Great Lakes.[45] 
The state is home to a number of areas maintained by the National Park 
Service including: Isle Royale National Park, located in Lake Superior, 
about 30 miles (48 km) southeast of Thunder Bay, Ontario. Other national 
protected areas in the state include: Keweenaw National Historical Park, 
Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, 
Huron National Forest, Manistee National Forest, Hiawatha National Forest, 
Ottawa National Forest and Father Marquette National Memorial. The largest 
section of the North Country National Scenic Trail passes through Michigan. 
With 78 state parks, 19 state recreation areas, and 6 state forests, Michigan 
has the largest state park and state forest system of any state. These 
parks and forests include Holland State Park, Mackinac Island State Park, 
Au Sable State Forest, and Mackinaw State Forest. Michigan has a continental 
climate, although there are two distinct regions. The southern and central 
parts of the Lower Peninsula (south of Saginaw Bay and from the Grand Rapids 
area southward) have a warmer climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa) 
with hot summers and cold winters. The northern part of Lower Peninsula 
and the entire Upper Peninsula has a more severe climate (Köppen Dfb), 
with warm, but shorter summers and longer, cold to very cold winters. Some 
parts of the state average high temperatures below freezing from December 
through February, and into early March in the far northern parts. During 
the winter through the middle of February the state is frequently subjected 
to heavy lake-effect snow. The state averages from 30–40 inches (76–102 cm) 
of precipitation annually, however some areas in the northern lower peninsula 
and the upper peninsula average almost 160" of snowfall per year.[48] Michigan's 
highest recorded temperature is 112 °F (44 °C) at Mio on July 13, 1936, 
and the coldest recorded temperature is −51 °F (−46 °C) at Vanderbilt on 
February 9, 1934.[49] The entire state averages 30 days of thunderstorm 
activity per year. These can be severe, especially in the southern part 
of the state. The state averages 17 tornadoes per year, which are more 
common in the extreme southern portion of the state. Portions of the southern 
border have been almost as vulnerable historically as states further west 
and in Tornado Alley. For this reason, many communities in the very southern 
portions of the state are equipped with tornado sirens to warn residents 
of approaching tornadoes. Farther north, in Central Michigan, Northern 
Michigan, and the Upper Peninsula, tornadoes are rare.[50][51] The geological 
formation of the state is greatly varied, with the Michigan Basin being 
the most major formation. Primary boulders are found over the entire surface 
of the Upper Peninsula (being principally of primitive origin), while Secondary 
deposits cover the entire Lower Peninsula. The Upper Peninsula exhibits 
Lower Silurian sandstones, limestones, copper and iron bearing rocks, corresponding 
to the Huronian system of Canada. The central portion of the Lower Peninsula 
contains coal measures and rocks of the Pennsylvanian period. Devonian 
and sub-Carboniferous deposits are scattered over the entire state. Michigan 
rarely experiences earthquakes, thus far mostly smaller ones that do not 
cause significant damage. A 4.6-magnitude earthquake struck in August 1947. 
More recently, a 4.2-magnitude earthquake occurred on Saturday, May 2, 
2015, shortly after noon, about 5 miles south of Galesburg, Michigan (9 
miles southeast of Kalamazoo) in central Michigan, about 140 miles west 
of Detroit, according to the Colorado-based U.S. Geological Survey's National 
Earthquake Information Center. No major damage or injuries were reported, 
according to Governor Rick Snyder's office.[52] The United States Census 
Bureau estimates that the population of Michigan was 9,922,576 on July 
1, 2015, an increase of 0.39% from 9,883,635 recorded at the 2010 United 
States Census.[3] The center of population of Michigan is located in Shiawassee 
County, in the southeastern corner of the civil township of Bennington, 
which is located northwest of the village of Morrice.[55] As of the 2010 
American Community Survey for the U.S. Census, the state had a foreign-born 
population of 592,212, or 6.0% of the total. Michigan has the largest Dutch, 
Finnish, and Macedonian populations in the United States. The 2010 Census 
reported: In the same year Hispanics or Latinos (of any race) made up 4.4% 
of the population. The large majority of Michigan's population is Caucasian. 
Americans of European descent live throughout Michigan and most of Metro 
Detroit. Large European American groups include those of German, British, 
Irish, Polish and Belgian ancestry. People of Scandinavian descent, and 
those of Finnish ancestry, have a notable presence in the Upper Peninsula. 
Western Michigan is known for the Dutch heritage of many residents (the 
highest concentration of any state), especially in Holland and metropolitan 
Grand Rapids. African-Americans, who came to Detroit and other northern 
cities in the Great Migration of the early 20th century, form a majority 
of the population of the city of Detroit and of other cities, including 
Flint and Benton Harbor. As of 2011, 34.3% of Michigan's children under 
the age of one belonged to racial or ethnic minority groups, meaning that 
they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white.[60] As of 
2007 about 300,000 people in Southeastern Michigan trace their descent 
from the Middle East.[61] Dearborn has a sizeable Arab community, with 
many Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac, and Lebanese who immigrated for jobs in 
the auto industry in the 1920s along with more recent Yemenis and Iraqis.[62] 
As of 2007, almost 8,000 Hmong people lived in the State of Michigan, about 
double their 1999 presence in the state.[63] As of 2007 most lived in northeastern 
Detroit, but they had been increasingly moving to Pontiac and Warren.[64] 
By 2015 the number of Hmong in the Detroit city limits had significantly 
declined.[65] Lansing hosts a statewide Hmong New Year Festival.[64] The 
Hmong community also had a prominent portrayal in the 2008 film Gran Torino, 
which was set in Detroit. As of 2015, 80% of Michigan's Japanese population 
lived in the counties of Macomb, Oakland, Washtenaw, and Wayne in the Detroit 
and Ann Arbor areas.[66] As of April 2013, the largest Japanese national 
population is in Novi, with 2,666 Japanese residents, and the next largest 
populations are respectively in Ann Arbor, West Bloomfield Township, Farmington 
Hills, and Battle Creek. The state has 481 Japanese employment facilities 
providing 35,554 local jobs. 391 of them are in Southeast Michigan, providing 
20,816 jobs, and the 90 in other regions in the state provide 14,738 jobs. 
The Japanese Direct Investment Survey of the Consulate-General of Japan, 
Detroit stated that over 2,208 additional Japanese residents were employed 
in the State of Michigan as of October 1, 2012, than in 2011.[67] During 
the 1990s the Japanese population of Michigan experienced an increase, 
and many Japanese people with children moved to particular areas for their 
proximity to Japanese grocery stores and high-performing schools.[66] A 
person from Michigan is called a Michigander or Michiganian;[68] also at 
times, but rarely, a "Michiganite".[69] Residents of the Upper Peninsula 
are sometimes referred to as "Yoopers" (a phonetic pronunciation of "U.P.ers"), 
and Upper Peninsula residents sometimes refer to those from the Lower Peninsula 
as "trolls" because they live below the bridge.[70] As of 2010, 91.11% 
(8,507,947) of Michigan residents age 5 and older spoke English at home 
as a primary language, while 2.93% (273,981) spoke Spanish, 1.04% (97,559) 
Arabic, 0.44% (41,189) German, 0.36% (33,648) Chinese (which includes Mandarin), 
0.31% (28,891) French, 0.29% (27,019) Polish, and Syriac languages (such 
as Modern Aramaic and Northeastern Neo-Aramaic) was spoken as a main language 
by 0.25% (23,420) of the population over the age of five. In total, 8.89% 
(830,281) of Michigan's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language 
other than English.[71] The Roman Catholic Church has six dioceses and 
one archdiocese in Michigan; Gaylord, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Lansing, 
Marquette, Saginaw and Detroit.[73] The Roman Catholic Church is the largest 
denomination by number of adherents, according to the Association of Religion 
Data Archives (ARDA) 2010 survey, with 1,717,296 adherents.[74] The Roman 
Catholic Church was the only organized religion in Michigan until the 19th 
century, reflecting the territory's French colonial roots. Detroit's Saint 
Anne's parish, established in 1701 by Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, is 
the second-oldest Roman Catholic parish in the United States.[75] On March 
8, 1833, the Holy See formally established a diocese in the Michigan territory, 
which included all of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the Dakotas east 
of the Mississippi River. When Michigan became a state in 1837, the boundary 
of the Diocese of Detroit was redrawn to coincide with that of the State; 
the other dioceses were later carved out from the Diocese of Detroit but 
remain part of the Ecclesiastical Province of Detroit.[76] In 2010, the 
largest Protestant denominations were the United Methodist Church with 
228,521 adherents; followed by the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod with 
219,618; and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with 120,598 adherents. 
The Christian Reformed Church in North America had almost 100,000 members 
and over 230 congregations in Michigan.[77] The Reformed Church in America 
had 76,000 members and 154 congregations in the state.[78] In the same 
survey, Jewish adherents in the state of Michigan were estimated at 44,382, 
and Muslims at 120,351.[79] The Lutheran Church was introduced by German 
and Scandinavian immigrants; Lutheranism is the second largest religious 
denomination in the state. The first Jewish synagogue in the state was 
Temple Beth El, founded by twelve German Jewish families in Detroit in 
1850.[80] In West Michigan, Dutch immigrants fled from the specter of religious 
persecution and famine in the Netherlands around 1850 and settled in and 
around what is now Holland, Michigan, establishing a "colony" on American 
soil that fervently held onto Calvinist doctrine that established a significant 
presence of Reformed churches.[81] Islam was introduced by immigrants from 
the Near East during the 20th century.[82] It is also home to the largest 
mosque in North America, the Islamic Center of America in Dearborn. Battle 
Creek, Michigan is also the birthplace of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, 
which was founded on May 21, 1863.[83][84] The U.S. Economic Development 
Administration estimated Michigan's 2014 gross state product to be $417.306 
billion, ranking 13th out of the 50 states.[85] According to the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, as of October 2015, the state's seasonally adjusted 
unemployment rate is estimated at 5.0%.[86][87] Source: Fortune[88] Products 
and services include automobiles, food products, information technology, 
aerospace, military equipment, furniture, and mining of copper and iron 
ore. Michigan is the third leading grower of Christmas trees with 60,520 
acres (245 km2) of land dedicated to Christmas tree farming.[89][90] The 
beverage Vernors was invented in Michigan in 1866, sharing the title of 
oldest soft drink with Hires Root Beer. Faygo was founded in Detroit on 
November 4, 1907. Two of the top four pizza chains were founded in Michigan 
and are headquartered there: Domino's Pizza by Tom Monaghan and Little 
Caesars Pizza by Mike Ilitch. Michigan became the 24th Right to Work state 
in U.S. in 2012. Since 2009, GM, Ford and Chrysler have managed a significant 
reorganization of their benefit funds structure after a volatile stock 
market which followed the September 11 attacks and early 2000s recession 
impacted their respective U.S. pension and benefit funds (OPEB).[91][92] 
General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler reached agreements with the United Auto 
Workers Union to transfer the liabilities for their respective health care 
and benefit funds to a 501(c)(9) Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association 
(VEBA). Manufacturing in the state grew 6.6% from 2001 to 2006,[93] but 
the high speculative price of oil became a factor for the U.S. auto industry 
during the economic crisis of 2008 impacting industry revenues. In 2009, 
GM and Chrysler emerged from Chapter 11 restructurings with financing provided 
in part by the U.S. and Canadian governments.[94][95] GM began its initial 
public offering (IPO) of stock in 2010.[96] For 2010, the Big Three domestic 
automakers have reported significant profits indicating the beginning of 
rebound.[97][98][99][100] As of 2002[update], Michigan ranked fourth in 
the U.S. in high tech employment with 568,000 high tech workers, which 
includes 70,000 in the automotive industry.[101] Michigan typically ranks 
third or fourth in overall Research & development (R&D) expenditures in 
the United States.[25][26] Its research and development, which includes 
automotive, comprises a higher percentage of the state's overall gross 
domestic product than for any other U.S. state.[102] The state is an important 
source of engineering job opportunities. The domestic auto industry accounts 
directly and indirectly for one of every ten jobs in the U.S.[103] Michigan 
was second in the U.S. in 2004 for new corporate facilities and expansions. 
From 1997 to 2004, Michigan was the only state to top the 10,000 mark for 
the number of major new developments;[23][104] however, the effects of 
the late 2000s recession have slowed the state's economy. In 2008, Michigan 
placed third in a site selection survey among the states for luring new 
business which measured capital investment and new job creation per one 
million population.[105] In August 2009, Michigan and Detroit's auto industry 
received $1.36 B in grants from the U.S. Department of Energy for the manufacture 
of electric vehicle technologies which is expected to generate 6,800 immediate 
jobs and employ 40,000 in the state by 2020.[106] From 2007 to 2009, Michigan 
ranked 3rd in the U.S. for new corporate facilities and expansions.[107][108] 
As leading research institutions, the University of Michigan, Michigan 
State University, and Wayne State University are important partners in 
the state's economy and its University Research Corridor.[27] Michigan's 
public universities attract more than $1.5 B in research and development 
grants each year.[28] The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory 
is located at Michigan State University. Michigan's workforce is well-educated 
and highly skilled, making it attractive to companies. It has the third 
highest number of engineering graduates nationally.[109] Detroit Metropolitan 
Airport is one of the nation's most recently expanded and modernized airports 
with six major runways, and large aircraft maintenance facilities capable 
of servicing and repairing a Boeing 747 and is a major hub for Delta Air 
Lines. Michigan's schools and colleges rank among the nation's best. The 
state has maintained its early commitment to public education. The state's 
infrastructure gives it a competitive edge; Michigan has 38 deep water 
ports.[110] In 2007, Bank of America announced that it would commit $25 billion 
to community development in Michigan following its acquisition of LaSalle 
Bank in Troy.[111] Michigan led the nation in job creation improvement 
in 2010.[112] Michigan's personal income tax is set to a flat rate of 4.25%. 
In addition, 22 cities impose income taxes; rates are set at 1% for residents 
and 0.5% for non-residents in all but four cities.[113] Michigan's state 
sales tax is 6%, though items such as food and medication are exempted 
from sales tax. Property taxes are assessed on the local level, but every 
property owner's local assessment contributes six mills (a rate of $6 per 
$1000 of property value) to the statutory State Education Tax. Property 
taxes are appealable to local boards of review and need the approval of 
the local electorate to exceed millage rates prescribed by state law and 
local charters. In 2011, the state repealed its business tax and replaced 
it with a 6% corporate income tax which substantially reduced taxes on 
business.[114][115] Article IX of the Constitution of the State of Michigan 
also provides limitations on how much the state can tax. The state also 
levies a 6% sales tax within the state and a Use tax on goods purchased 
outside the state (that are brought in and used in state).[116] The use 
tax applies to internet sales/purchases from outside Michigan, and is equivalent 
to the sales tax.[117] A wide variety of commodity crops, fruits, and vegetables 
are grown in Michigan, making it second only to California among U.S. states 
in the diversity of its agriculture.[118] The state has 54,800 farms utilizing 
10,000,000 acres (40,000 km2) of land which sold $6.49 billion worth of 
products in 2010.[119] The most valuable agricultural product is milk. 
Leading crops include corn, soybeans, flowers, wheat, sugar beets and potatoes. 
Livestock in the state included 1 million cattle, 1 million hogs, 78,000 
sheep and over 3 million chickens. Livestock products accounted for 38% 
of the value of agricultural products while crops accounted for the majority. 
Michigan is a leading grower of fruit in the U.S., including blueberries, 
cherries, apples, grapes, and peaches.[29][120] Plums, pears, and strawberries 
are also grown. These fruits are mainly grown in West Michigan due to the 
moderating effect of Lake Michigan on the climate. There is also significant 
fruit production, especially cherries, but also grapes, apples, and other 
fruits, in Northwest Michigan along Lake Michigan. Michigan produces wines, 
beers and a multitude of processed food products. Kellogg's cereal is based 
in Battle Creek, Michigan and processes many locally grown foods. Thornapple 
Valley, Ball Park Franks, Koegel Meat Company, and Hebrew National sausage 
companies are all based in Michigan. Michigan is home to very fertile land 
in the Saginaw Valley and "Thumb" areas. Products grown there include corn, 
sugar beets, navy beans, and soy beans. Sugar beet harvesting usually begins 
the first of October. It takes the sugar factories about five months to 
process the 3.7 million tons of sugarbeets into 485,000 tons of pure, white 
sugar.[121] Michigan's largest sugar refiner, Michigan Sugar Company[122] 
is the largest east of the Mississippi River and the fourth largest in 
the nation. Michigan Sugar brand names are Pioneer Sugar and the newly 
incorporated Big Chief Sugar. Potatoes are grown in Northern Michigan, 
and corn is dominant in Central Michigan. Alfalfa, cucumbers, and asparagus 
are also grown. Michigan's tourists spend $17.2 billion per year in the 
state, supporting 193,000 tourism jobs.[123] Michigan's tourism website 
ranks among the busiest in the nation.[124] Destinations draw vacationers, 
hunters, and nature enthusiasts from across the United States and Canada. 
Michigan is fifty percent forest land, much of it quite remote. The forests, 
lakes and thousands of miles of beaches are top attractions. Event tourism 
draws large numbers to occasions like the Tulip Time Festival and the National 
Cherry Festival. In 2006, the Michigan State Board of Education mandated 
that all public schools in the state hold their first day of school after 
the Labor Day holiday, in accordance with the new Post Labor Day School 
law. A survey found that 70% of all tourism business comes directly from 
Michigan residents, and the Michigan Hotel, Motel, & Resort Association 
claimed that the shorter summer in between school years cut into the annual 
tourism season in the state.[125] Tourism in metropolitan Detroit draws 
visitors to leading attractions, especially The Henry Ford, the Detroit 
Institute of Arts, the Detroit Zoo, and to sports in Detroit. Other museums 
include the Detroit Historical Museum, the Charles H. Wright Museum of 
African American History, museums in the Cranbrook Educational Community, 
and the Arab American National Museum. The metro area offers four major 
casinos, MGM Grand Detroit, Greektown, Motor City, and Caesars Windsor 
in Windsor, Ontario, Canada; moreover, Detroit is the largest American 
city and metropolitan region to offer casino resorts.[126] Hunting and 
fishing are significant industries in the state. Charter boats are based 
in many Great Lakes cities to fish for salmon, trout, walleye and perch. 
Michigan ranks first in the nation in licensed hunters (over one million) 
who contribute $2 billion annually to its economy. Over three-quarters 
of a million hunters participate in white-tailed deer season alone. Many 
school districts in rural areas of Michigan cancel school on the opening 
day of firearm deer season, because of attendance concerns. Michigan's 
Department of Natural Resources manages the largest dedicated state forest 
system in the nation. The forest products industry and recreational users 
contribute $12 billion and 200,000 associated jobs annually to the state's 
economy. Public hiking and hunting access has also been secured in extensive 
commercial forests. The state has the highest number of golf courses and 
registered snowmobiles in the nation.[127] The state has numerous historical 
markers, which can themselves become the center of a tour.[128] The Great 
Lakes Circle Tour is a designated scenic road system connecting all of 
the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.[129] With its position in relation 
to the Great Lakes and the countless ships that have foundered over the 
many years in which they have been used as a transport route for people 
and bulk cargo, Michigan is a world-class scuba diving destination. The 
Michigan Underwater Preserves are 11 underwater areas where wrecks are 
protected for the benefit of sport divers. Michigan has nine international 
road crossings with Ontario, Canada: A second international bridge is currently 
under consideration between Detroit and Windsor.[130] Michigan is served 
by four Class I railroads: the Canadian National Railway, the Canadian 
Pacific Railway, CSX Transportation, and the Norfolk Southern Railway. 
These are augmented by several dozen short line railroads. The vast majority 
of rail service in Michigan is devoted to freight, with Amtrak and various 
scenic railroads the exceptions.[131] Amtrak passenger rail services the 
state, connecting many southern and western Michigan cities to Chicago, 
Illinois. There are plans for commuter rail for Detroit and its suburbs 
(see SEMCOG Commuter Rail).[132][133][134] The Detroit Metropolitan Wayne 
County Airport, located in the western suburb of Romulus, was in 2010 the 
16th busiest airfield in North America measured by passenger traffic.[135] 
The Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids is the next busiest 
airport in the state, served by eight airlines to 23 destinations. Flint 
Bishop International Airport is the third largest airport in the state, 
served by four airlines to several primary hubs. Smaller regional and local 
airports are located throughout the state including on several islands. 
Cherry Capital Airport is located in Traverse City. Other economically 
significant cities include: Half of the wealthiest communities in the state 
are located in Oakland County, just north of Detroit. Another wealthy community 
is located just east of the city, in Grosse Pointe. Only three of these 
cities are located outside of Metro Detroit. The city of Detroit itself, 
with a per capita income of $14,717, ranks 517th on the list of Michigan 
locations by per capita income. Benton Harbor is the poorest city in Michigan, 
with a per capita income of $8,965, while Barton Hills is the richest with 
a per capita income of $110,683. Michigan's education system provides services 
to 1.6 million K-12 students in public schools. More than 124,000 students 
attend private schools and an uncounted number are home-schooled under 
certain legal requirements.[137][138] The public school system has a $14.5 billion 
budget in 2008–2009.[139] Michigan has a number of public universities 
spread throughout the state and numerous private colleges as well. Michigan 
State University has the eighth largest campus population of any U.S. school. 
Seven of the state's universities—Central Michigan University, University 
of Michigan, Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, 
Oakland University, Wayne State University, and Western Michigan University—are 
classified as research universities by the Carnegie Foundation.[140] Michigan's 
major-league sports teams include: Detroit Tigers baseball team, Detroit 
Lions football team, Detroit Red Wings ice hockey team, and the Detroit 
Pistons men's basketball team. All of Michigan's major league teams play 
in the Metro Detroit area. The Pistons played at Detroit's Cobo Arena until 
1978 and at the Pontiac Silverdome until 1988 when they moved into The 
Palace of Auburn Hills. The Detroit Lions played at Tiger Stadium in Detroit 
until 1974, then moved to the Pontiac Silverdome where they played for 
27 years between 1975 and 2002 before moving to Ford Field in Detroit in 
2002. The Detroit Tigers played at Tiger Stadium (formerly known as Navin 
Field and Briggs Stadium) from 1912 to 1999. In 2000 they moved to Comerica 
Park. The Red Wings played at Olympia Stadium before moving to Joe Louis 
Arena in 1979. Professional hockey got its start in Houghton,[141] when 
the Portage Lakers were formed.[citation needed] The Michigan International 
Speedway is the site of NASCAR races and Detroit was formerly the site 
of a Formula One World Championship Grand Prix race. From 1959 to 1961, 
Detroit Dragway hosted the NHRA's U.S. Nationals.[142] Michigan is home 
to one of the major canoeing marathons: the 120-mile (190 km) Au Sable 
River Canoe Marathon. The Port Huron to Mackinac Boat Race is also a favorite. 
Twenty-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams was born in Saginaw. The 
2011 World Champion for Women's Artistic Gymnastics, Jordyn Wieber is from 
DeWitt. Wieber was also a member of the gold medal winning team at the 
London Olympics in 2012. Collegiate sports in Michigan are popular in addition 
to professional sports. The state's two largest athletic programs are the 
Michigan Wolverines and Michigan State Spartans, which play in the NCAA 
Big Ten Conference. Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, home to the Michigan 
Wolverines football team, is the largest stadium in the Western Hemisphere 
and the second-largest stadium worldwide behind Rungrado May Day Stadium 
in Pyongyang, North Korea. Michigan is, by tradition, known as "The Wolverine 
State," and the University of Michigan takes the wolverine as its mascot. 
The association is well and long established: for example, many Detroiters 
volunteered to fight during the American Civil War and George Armstrong 
Custer, who led the Michigan Brigade, called them the "Wolverines". The 
origins of this association are obscure; it may derive from a busy trade 
in wolverine furs in Sault Ste. Marie in the 18th century or may recall 
a disparagement intended to compare early settlers in Michigan with the 
vicious mammal. Wolverines are, however, extremely rare in Michigan. A 
sighting in February 2004 near Ubly was the first confirmed sighting in 
Michigan in 200 years.[143] The animal was found dead in 2010.[144] Coordinates:
