Edward Stewart Plank (August 31, 1875 – February 24, 1926), nicknamed "Gettysburg 
Eddie", was an American professional baseball player. A pitcher, Plank 
played in Major League Baseball for the Philadelphia Athletics from 1901 
through 1914, the St. Louis Terriers in 1915, and the St. Louis Browns 
in 1916 and 1917. Plank is the first left-handed pitcher to win 200 games 
and then 300 games, and now ranks third in all-time wins among left-handers 
with 326 career victories (eleventh all time) and first all-time in career 
shutouts by a left-handed pitcher with 66. Philadelphia went to the World 
Series five times while Plank played there, but he sat out the 1910 World 
Series due to an injury. Plank had only a 1.32 earned run average (ERA) 
in his World Series career, but he was unlucky, with a 2–5 win–loss record 
in those games. Plank died of a stroke in 1926. He was elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1946. Plank grew up on a farm near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. 
He was the fourth of seven children[1] born to Martha McCreary and David 
Plank. His father was a school director and tax collector in Gettysburg.[2] 
Plank did not play baseball until Frank Foreman, the pitching coach at 
Gettysburg College, asked him to try out for the school's baseball team.[1][3] 
History books often erroneously state that Plank graduated from Gettysburg 
College. He attended Gettysburg Academy, a prep school affiliated with 
the college. However, he played for the college's team without ever being 
enrolled there.[4] Plank signed with the Richmond Colts of the Virginia 
League, a minor league. The league folded before Plank could pitch for 
the Colts. Foreman recommended Plank to Connie Mack, the manager of the 
Philadelphia Athletics, and Mack signed Plank to a contract.[1] Plank made 
his major league debut for the Athletics on May 13, 1901. As a rookie, 
Plank pitched to a 17-13 win–loss record with a 3.31 earned run average 
(ERA) and 28 complete games in 32 games started. He won 20 games for the 
first time in his career in 1902, as the Athletics won the American League 
(AL) pennant. He won 23 games in 1903 while leading the AL in games started.[1] 
In 1905, Plank made his first trip to the World Series. He faced Christy 
Mathewson in the first game and Joe McGinnity in the fourth game. Though 
Plank gave up only three runs in 17 innings during the series, the Athletics 
lost to the New York Giants in five games and did not score an earned run 
in the entire series.[5] The Athletics returned to the World Series in 
1910, but Plank was forced to sit out with a sore arm.[6] By 1911, Plank 
was the last member of the Athletics remaining from the 1901 team.[7] The 
1911 team made the World Series and faced the Giants again. After Plank 
won Game Two and lost in a relief appearance in Game Five, the Athletics 
won the series in six games.[8] In 1913, the Athletics and Giants met again 
in the World Series, and Plank faced Mathewson in Games Two and Five. Mathewson 
hit a tenth-inning single off of Plank to set up a Giants victory in Game 
Two, but Plank and the Athletics bested Mathewson 3–1 in the fifth and 
deciding game of the series.[9] In 1914, Plank's final year with Philadelphia, 
he went to the World Series again. Plank pitched a complete game in Game 
Two, but he lost 1-0 and the Boston Braves won the series in four games.[10] 
During his tenure in Philadelphia, Plank was one of the most consistent 
pitchers in the game, winning over 20 games seven times.[11] In the four 
World Series in which he played, Plank earned a 1.32 ERA but only a 2–5 
win-loss record. He pitched complete games in all six of his World Series 
starts.[12] In November 1914, it was rumored that Plank would be sold to 
the New York Highlanders.[13] In December, Plank signed a contract to play 
in the Federal League. Mack expressed no regret at Plank's departure, saying, 
"I wish him the best of luck... I was through with him. He was after the 
money. He was a wonderful pitcher and he is a good one yet."[14] He played 
for the outlaw league's St. Louis Terriers and won 21 games, the eighth 
and final time he reached the 20-win plateau. Some baseball reference works 
decline to acknowledge the Federal League as a major league, and therefore 
give Plank credit for only seven 20-win seasons and 305 total wins. When 
the Federal League folded, Plank applied for free agency but was declared 
to belong to the St. Louis Browns for 1916. In September of that year, 
Plank predicted that he might be able to pitch ten more seasons, saying, 
"I don't know whether it is that I have more on the ball this season than 
I had in other years, but at any rate I feel that I have just as much stuff 
as I ever did."[15] However, by June 1917 newspapers reported that Plank's 
career was nearly over; he had struggled with arm problems and had left 
the team at one point due to a nervous breakdown.[16] He retired in October 
1917, citing stomach difficulties brought on by the stress of baseball.[17] 
His final game was a 1–0 11-inning complete game loss to Walter Johnson 
and the Washington Senators on August 6, 1917. Despite his announcement, 
the New York Yankees traded pitchers Urban Shocker and Nick Cullop, infielders 
Fritz Maisel and Joe Gedeon, catcher Les Nunamaker, and cash to the Browns 
for Plank and Del Pratt. Plank refused to report to New York, insisting 
he was retired.[1] Over his career, Plank amassed a 326–194 record, a 2.35 
ERA, and 2,246 strikeouts. He won 305 games in the American League, making 
him that league's winningest left-handed pitcher. In addition, he was the 
winningest pitcher (left or right-handed) in the American League until 
1921, when he was surpassed by Walter Johnson. Plank was known as a finesse 
pitcher with a good sidearm sweeping curveball. He was also known for his 
long pauses on the mound, which some claimed lengthened the duration of 
the games in which he pitched. Plank married Anna (née Myers) in 1915. 
They had a son, named Edward Stewart Plank Jr.[1] Plank's brother Ira was 
the baseball coach at Gettysburg College for more than twenty years.[18] 
After his 1917 retirement, Plank went into the garage business in Gettysburg. 
He pitched the 1918 season for the Steelton club of the Bethlehem Steel 
League, an industrial baseball league. Steelton was only 40 miles from 
his home and the arrangement allowed him to manage his business during 
the week.[19] He died on February 24, 1926, several days after suffering 
a stroke.[20] Plank is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Gettysburg.[4] Upon 
hearing of Plank's death, Connie Mack said that he felt like a father who 
had just lost a son. "Eddie Plank was one of the smartest left-hand pitchers 
it has been my pleasure to have on my club. He was short and light, as 
pitchers go, but he made up for the physical defects, if such they were, 
by his study of the game and his smartness when he was on the pitching 
peak", he said.[21] Former teammate Jack Coombs said, "I have always been 
thankful that I was thrown into such intimate contact with so inspiring 
a man in the days when the majority of ballplayers were of a much lower 
type than at the present time."[22] P is for Plank, The arm of the A's; 
When he tangled with Matty Games lasted for days. In 1943, former teammate 
Eddie Collins remembered Plank as the greatest pitcher in baseball. "Not 
the fastest. Not the trickiest, and not the possessor of the most stuff, 
but just the greatest", Collins said.[3] He was inducted into the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1946 and voted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame 
in 1972.[24] Gettysburg College began planning for the Eddie Plank Memorial 
Gymnasium at the college shortly after Plank's death.[25] The gym was completed 
in 1927 and indoor sports such as basketball and wrestling were played 
there until 1962.[26] A restaurant in downtown Gettysburg honors Plank's 
career.[27] A portion of Plank's childhood farm is a housing development 
known as Plank's Field.[4] Plank is mentioned in the poem "Line-Up for 
Yesterday" by Ogden Nash. In 2006, a T206 tobacco card featuring Plank 
was described as the "second most valuable card in existence."[28] It was 
owned by Arizona Diamondbacks owner Ken Kendrick and was part of a collection 
that Kendrick loaned to the Baseball Hall of Fame for display there. The 
most valuable baseball card in existence, a T206 Honus Wagner card, is
