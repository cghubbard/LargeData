As player As manager William Benjamin "Ben" Chapman (December 25, 1908 
– July 7, 1993) was an American outfielder and manager in Major League 
Baseball who played for several teams. He began his career with the New 
York Yankees, playing his first seven seasons there. His playing reputation 
was eclipsed by the role he played in 1947 as manager of the Phillies, 
antagonizing Jackie Robinson by shouting racist epithets and opposing his 
presence on a major league team on the basis of Robinson's race with unsportsmanlike 
conduct that proved an embarrassment for his team. During the period from 
1926 to 1943, he had more stolen bases than any other player, leading the 
American League four times. After twelve seasons, during which he batted 
.302 and led the AL in assists and double plays twice each, he spent two 
years in the minor leagues and returned to the majors as a National League 
pitcher for three seasons, becoming player-manager of the Philadelphia 
Phillies, his final team. Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Chapman batted 
and threw right-handed. He was a teammate of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Bill 
Dickey, Joe DiMaggio and other stars on the Yankees from 1930 through the 
middle of the 1936 season. In his 1930 rookie season with the Yankees, 
during which he batted .316, he played exclusively in the infield as a 
second and third baseman; although he played only 91 games at third, he 
led the AL in errors, and after Joe Sewell was acquired in the offseason, 
Chapman was shifted to the outfield to take advantage of his speed and 
throwing arm. He led the AL in stolen bases for the next three seasons 
(1931–33); his 1931 total of 61 was the highest by a Yankee since Fritz 
Maisel's 74 in 1914, and would be the most by any major leaguer between 
1921 and 1961 (equalled only by George Case in 1943). With the Yankees, 
he also batted over .300 and scored 100 runs four times each, batted in 
100 runs twice, led the AL in triples in 1934, and made each of the first 
three AL All-Star teams from 1933–35, leading off in the 1933 game as the 
first AL hitter in All-Star history. In the 1932 World Series he batted 
.294 with six runs batted in as the Yankees swept the Chicago Cubs. In 
one game on July 9, 1932, he had three home runs, two of which were inside-the-park, 
and on May 30, 1934 he broke up Detroit Tiger Earl Whitehill's no-hitter 
in the ninth inning. It was in New York that the extent of Chapman's bigotry 
first surfaced. He taunted Jewish fans at Yankee Stadium with Nazi salutes 
and disparaging epithets.[1] In a 1933 game, his intentional spiking of 
Washington Senators' second baseman Buddy Myer[2] (who was incorrectly 
believed to be Jewish)[3] caused a 20-minute brawl that saw 300 fans participate 
and resulted in five-game suspensions and $100 fines for each of the players 
involved.[4] In June 1936, Chapman – then hitting .266[5] and expendable 
with the arrival of DiMaggio[6] – was traded to the Senators. The trade 
was ironic in that the player the Yankees received in return was Jake Powell, 
who would become infamous for a 1938 WGN radio interview in which he stated 
that he liked to crack blacks over the head with his nightstick as a police 
officer in Dayton, Ohio during the off-season. Furthermore, earlier in 
the 1936 season, Powell had purposely collided with Hank Greenberg, the 
Detroit Tigers' Jewish first baseman, breaking Greenberg's wrist and ending 
his season after only 12 games.[1] After the trade, Chapman rebounded to 
finish the year with a .315 average, again making the All-Star team and 
scoring 100 runs, and collecting a career-high 50 doubles. In June 1937 
the Senators sent him to the Boston Red Sox, and he led the AL in steals 
for the fourth time with 35. The following year he hit a career-best .340 
with Boston, after which he was traded to the Cleveland Indians. After 
seasons hitting .290 and .286, Cleveland sent him back to Washington in 
December 1940; he hit .255 with the Senators before they released him in 
May 1941, and after he batted only .226 with the Chicago White Sox over 
the remainder of the year, his major league career appeared to be finished. 
After managing in the Class B Piedmont League in 1942 and 1944 – he was 
suspended for the 1943 season for punching an umpire – Chapman resurfaced, 
following brief World War II military service, as a pitcher in the National 
League with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1944, earning five wins against three 
losses. After starting the next year 3–3, he was traded to the Phillies 
on June 15, 1945, becoming player-manager on June 30. He made three relief 
appearances for the team that year, and played his final game in 1946 with 
one inning of relief. He appeared in 1,717 games over 15 seasons, batting 
.302 lifetime with 287 stolen bases (including 15 of home), 1,144 runs, 
90 home runs, 407 doubles, 107 triples and 977 RBI, and winning eight of 
14 decisions as a pitcher; his 184 steals with the Yankees placed him second 
in team history behind Hal Chase. With the Phillies buried in last place 
in 1945 (winners of only 17 of 68 games), Chapman replaced Freddie Fitzsimmons 
as manager. The team improved somewhat through the end of the year, and 
climbed to fifth place in 1946, the first year of the postwar baseball 
boom and the last season in which the color line was in effect. In April 
1947, Brooklyn called up Robinson from the Montreal Royals and made him 
their regular first baseman: he was the first African-American to play 
in the major leagues in more than sixty years. Chapman's Phillies were 
not the only NL team to oppose integration – several Dodger players had 
allegedly tried to petition management to keep him off the team[7] – but 
during an early-season series in Brooklyn, the level of verbal abuse directed 
by Chapman and his players at Robinson reached such proportions that it 
made headlines in the New York and national press. Chapman instructed his 
pitchers, whenever they had a 3–0 count against Robinson, to bean him rather 
than walk him.[8] Chapman's attempts to intimidate Robinson eventually 
backfired, with the Dodgers rallying behind Robinson, and there was increased 
sympathy for Robinson in many circles. The backlash against Chapman was 
so severe that he was asked to pose in a photograph with Robinson as a 
conciliatory gesture when the two teams next met in Philadelphia in May. 
This incident prompted Robinson's teammate Dixie Walker to comment, "I 
never thought I'd see old Ben eat shit like that."[9] Robinson went on 
to stardom and a ten-year career, a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame, 
and a revered position in American sporting and civil rights history. Chapman's 
baseball career, however, was coming to an end. He survived the 1947 season, 
but the Phillies fell to seventh place. In July 1948, with the team still 
in seventh, Chapman was fired and eventually replaced by Eddie Sawyer. 
He would surface one more time in the majors, as a coach for the 1952 Cincinnati 
Reds.[10] Chapman's career major league managing record was 196–276 (.415).[11] 
In an interview with journalist Ray Robinson in the 1990s, Chapman stated, 
"A man learns about things and mellows as he grows older. I think that 
maybe I've changed a bit. Maybe I went too far in those days. But I always 
went along with the bench jockeying, which has always been part of the 
game. Maybe I was rougher at it than some other players. I thought that 
you could use it to upset and weaken the other team. It might give you 
an advantage. The world changes." Reflecting on the success of his son, 
then coaching black players on an integrated football team, "Look, I'm 
real proud I've raised my son different. And he gets along well with them. 
They like him. That's a nice thing, don't you think?"[2] Chapman's first 
wife, Mary Elizabeth Payne, divorced Chapman on June 11, 1935, getting 
the divorce in Birmingham, Alabama. In the divorce petition, Payne charged 
Chapman with domestic violence.[12] Chapman later worked in insurance in 
his home of Alabama. He was a consultant on Iron Horse: Lou Gehrig in His 
Time, Ray Robinson's 2006 biography of Lou Gehrig.[2] Chapman died of a 
heart attack at age 84 at his home in Hoover, Alabama. He was interred 
at Birmingham's Elmwood Cemetery.[citation needed] The newspaper headline 
"Red Sox beat Yanks 5–4 on Chapman's Homer", a possibly intentional pun 
on the title of John Keats' poem "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer", 
is mentioned in Vladimir Nabokov's novel Pale Fire (lines 97–98), where 
it is misinterpreted by the character Charles Kinbote. Sources disagree 
on whether the headline is genuine[13][14] or not.[15] In Harry Turtledove's 
alternate history novel American Empire: The Victorious Opposition, Chapman 
is a member of the Freedom Party (an analogue of the Nazi Party) as a Chief 
Assault Band Leader (a captain in Army ranking). His only appearance is 
when he drops off Willy Knight as a political prisoner at Camp Dependable 
(an extermination camp in the Population Reduction, an analogue of the 
Holocaust) in the dead of night. In the feature film 42, Chapman is played
