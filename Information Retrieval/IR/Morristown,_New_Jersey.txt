Morristown is a town in Morris County, New Jersey, United States. As of 
the 2010 United States Census, the town's population was 18,411,[9][10][11] 
reflecting a decline of 133 (-0.7%) from the 18,544 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 2,355 (+14.5%) from the 16,189 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[19] It is the county seat of Morris County.[20][21] 
Morristown has been called "the military capital of the American Revolution" 
because of its strategic role in the war for independence from Great Britain.[22][23] 
Today this history is visible in a variety of locations throughout the 
town that collectively make up Morristown National Historical Park. According 
to British colonial records, the first permanent European settlement at 
Morristown occurred in 1715, when a settlement was founded as New Hanover 
by migrants from New York and Connecticut. Morris County was created on 
March 15, 1739, from portions of Hunterdon County. The county, and ultimately 
Morristown itself, was named for the popular Governor of the Province, 
Lewis Morris, who championed benefits for the colonists.[24][25] Morristown 
was incorporated as a town by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 
6, 1865, within Morris Township, and it was formally set off from the township 
in 1895.[26] The area was inhabited by the Lenni Lenape Native Americans 
for up to 6,000 years prior to exploration by Europeans.[27] The first 
European settlements in this portion of New Jersey were established by 
the Swedes and Dutch in the early 17th century, when a significant trade 
in furs existed between the natives and the Europeans at temporary posts. 
It became part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, but the English seized 
control of the region in 1664, which was granted to Sir George Carteret 
and John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton, as the Province of New 
Jersey. Morristown was settled around 1715 by English Presbyterians from 
Southold, New York on Long Island and New Haven, Connecticut as the village 
of New Hanover.[28][29] The town's central location and road connections 
led to its selection as the seat of the new Morris County shortly after 
its separation from Hunterdon County on March 15, 1739.[30] The village 
and county were named for Lewis Morris, the first and then sitting royal 
governor of a united colony of New Jersey.[28] By the middle of the 18th 
century, Morristown had 250 residents, with two churches, a courthouse, 
two taverns, two schools, several stores, and numerous mills and farms 
nearby. George Washington first came to Morristown in May 1773, two years 
before the Revolutionary War broke out, and traveled from there to New 
York City together with John Parke Custis (his stepson) and Lord Stirling.[31] 
In 1777, General George Washington and the Continental Army marched from 
the victories at Trenton and Princeton to encamp near Morristown from January 
to May. Washington had his headquarters during that first encampment at 
Jacob Arnold's Tavern located at the Morristown Green in the center of 
the town.[32] Morristown was selected for its extremely strategic location.[33] 
It was between Philadelphia and New York and near New England. It also 
was chosen for the skills and trades of the residents, local industries 
and natural resources to provide arms, and what was thought to be the ability 
of the community to provide enough food to support the army. The churches 
were used for inoculations for smallpox. That first headquarters, Arnold's 
Tavern, was eventually moved .5 miles (800 m) south of the green onto Mount 
Kemble Avenue to become All Souls Hospital in the late 19th century. It 
suffered a fire in 1918, and the original structure was demolished, but 
new buildings for the hospital were built directly across the street.[34][35] 
From December 1779 to June 1780 the Continental Army's second encampment 
at Morristown was at Jockey Hollow. Then, Washington's headquarters in 
Morristown was located at the Ford Mansion, a large mansion near what was 
then the 'edge of town.' Ford's widow and children shared the house with 
Martha Washington and officers of the Continental Army.[36] " The winter 
of 1780 was the worst winter of the Revolutionary War. The starvation was 
complicated by extreme inflation of money and lack of pay for the army. 
The entire Pennsylvania contingent successfully mutinied and later, 200 
New Jersey soldiers attempted to emulate them (unsuccessfully).[37] During 
Washington's second stay, in March 1780, he declared St. Patrick's Day 
a holiday to honor his many Irish troops.[38] Martha Washington traveled 
from Virginia and remained with her husband each winter throughout the 
war. The Marquis de Lafayette came to Washington in Morristown to inform 
him that France would be sending ships and trained soldiers to aid the 
Continental Army.[39] The Ford Mansion, Jockey Hollow, and Fort Nonsense 
are all preserved as part of Morristown National Historical Park managed 
by the National Park Service, which has the distinction among historic 
preservationists of being the first National Historical Park established 
in the United States.[40][41] During Washington's stay, Benedict Arnold 
was court-martialed at Dickerson's Tavern, on Spring Street, for charges 
related to profiteering from military supplies at Philadelphia. His admonishment 
was made public, but Washington quietly promised the hero, Arnold, to make 
it up to him.[42] Alexander Hamilton courted and wed Elizabeth Schuyler 
at a residence where Washington's personal physician was billeted. Locally 
known as the Schuyler-Hamilton House, the Dr. Jabez Campfield House is 
listed on both the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places.[43][44] 
The Morristown Green has a statue commemorating the meeting of George Washington, 
the young Marquis de LaFayette, and young Alexander Hamilton depicting 
them discussing forthcoming aid of French tall ships and troops being sent 
by King Louis XVI of France to aid the Continental Army.[45] Morristown's 
Burnham Park has a statue of the "Father of the American Revolution", Thomas 
Paine, who wrote the best selling booklet Common Sense, which urged a complete 
break from British rule. The bronze statue, by sculptor Georg J. Lober, 
shows Paine in 1776 (using a drum as a table during the withdrawal of the 
army across New Jersey) composing Crisis 1. He wrote These are the times 
that try men's souls .... The statue was dedicated on July 4, 1950.[46] 
The idea for constructing the Morris Canal is credited to Morristown businessman 
George P. Macculloch, who in 1822 convened a group to discuss his concept 
for a canal. The group included Governor of New Jersey Isaac Halstead Williamson, 
which led to approval of the proposal by the New Jersey Legislature later 
that year. The canal was used for a century.[47] The Marquis de Lafayette 
returned to Morristown in July 1825 on his return tour of the United States, 
where a ball was held in his honor at the 1807 Sansay House on DeHart Street, 
which still stands.[48] Antoine le Blanc, a French immigrant laborer murdered 
the Sayre family and their servant (or possibly slave), Phoebe. He was 
tried and convicted of murder of the Sayres (but not of Phoebe) on August 
13, 1833. On September 6, 1833, Le Blanc became the last person hanged 
on the Morristown Green. Until late 2006, the house where the murders were 
committed was known as "Jimmy's Haunt," which is purported to be haunted 
by Phoebe's ghost because her murder never saw justice. In 2007 Jimmy's 
Haunt was torn down to make way for a bank. Samuel F. B. Morse and Alfred 
Vail built the first telegraph at the Speedwell Ironworks in Morristown 
on January 6, 1838. The first telegraph message was A patient waiter is 
no loser. The first public demonstration of the invention occurred five 
days later as an early step toward the information age.[49] Jacob Arnold's 
Tavern, the first headquarters for Washington in Morristown, was purchased 
by the Colles family to save it from demolition in 1886. It was moved by 
horse-power in the winter of 1887 from "the green" (after being stuck on 
Bank Street for about six weeks) to a site 0.5 miles (0.80 km) south on 
Mount Kemble Avenue at what is now a parking lot for the Atlantic RIMM 
Rehabilitation Hospital. It became a boarding house for four years until 
it was converted by the Grey Nuns from Montreal into All Souls Hospital, 
the first general hospital in Morris County.[50] George and Martha Washington's 
second floor ballroom became a chapel and the first floor tavern became 
a ward for patients. The building was lost to a fire in 1918.[51] The entire 
organization, nurses, doctors, and patients of All Souls Hospital were 
then moved across Mount Kemble Avenue, U.S. Route 202, to a newly built 
brick hospital building. All Souls' was set to close because of financial 
difficulties in the late 1960s. In 1973, it became Community Medical Center. 
In 1977, the center became bankrupt and was purchased by the then new and 
larger Morristown Memorial Hospital, which is now the Morristown Medical 
Center.[52] On December 18, 1843, the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal 
Church was incorporated. This was the first congregation established by 
blacks in Morris County. It is still active. The first site of the Church 
was located at 13 Spring Street and served as the only schoolhouse for 
colored children until 1870. The Church relocated to its present site at 
59 Spring Street in 1874.[53][54] On January 5, 2009, five red lights were 
spotted in the Morristown area night skies. The event was a staged hoax 
using helium balloons and flares, but became nationally known as the Morristown 
UFO hoax.[55] According to the United States Census Bureau, Morristown 
had a total area of 3.026 square miles (7.839 km2), including 2.929 square

Morristown has attempted to implement transit-oriented development. Morristown 
was designated in 1999 as of one of New Jersey's first five "transit villages".[136] 
In 1999, Morristown changed its zoning code to designate the area around 
the train station as a "Transit Village Core" for mixed-use. The designation 
was at least partly responsible for development plans for several mixed-use 
condominium developments.[137] New Jersey Transit offers rail service at 
the Morristown station[138] which offers service on the Morristown Line 
to Newark Broad Street, Secaucus Junction, New York Penn Station and Hoboken 
Terminal.[139] The town benefited from shortened commuting times to New 
York City due to the "Midtown Direct" service New Jersey Transit instituted 
in the 1990s. NJ Transit local bus service is offered from the Morristown 
rail station, Morristown Medical Center and Headquarters Plaza on the 871, 
872, 873, 874, 875 and 880 bus routes,[140] replacing service that had 
been offered on the MCM1, MCM2, MCM3, MCM4, MCM8 and MCM10 routes until 
2010, when subsidies to the local provider were eliminated as part of budget 
cuts.[141][142] The town's Department of Public Works operates "Colonial 
Coach", which provides free transportation within Morristown.[143] The
