The Rochester Red Wings are a minor league baseball team based in Rochester, 
New York. The team plays in the International League and is the top minor 
league affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. The Red Wings play in Frontier 
Field, located in downtown Rochester. Founded in 1899, it is the oldest 
continuously operating sports franchise in North America below the major 
league level. The Red Wings were an affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals 
for 32 years (1929–1960), then spent 42 years (1961–2002) as the top farm 
club of the Baltimore Orioles. Soon after the 2002 season ended, the Red 
Wings became the top affiliate of the Twins (2003–present). The franchise 
played from 1929 through 1996 at Silver Stadium (called Red Wing Stadium 
(1929–1968)) and moved to Frontier Field in 1997. The Red Wings, along 
with the Pawtucket Red Sox, hold the record for the longest professional 
baseball game, lasting a total of 33 innings and 8 hours, 25 minutes over 
the course of three different days. The game was held at Pawtucket's McCoy 
Stadium, beginning on April 18, 1981. It was suspended just after 4 a.m. 
the next morning, and Rochester lost, 3–2, when the game resumed on June 
23. Baseball in Rochester dates back to 1877 with the "Rochesters" of the 
International Association, and Rochester has had a franchise in the league 
now known as the International League as early as 1885. According to Rochester 
sports historian Douglas Brei, only six franchises in the history of North 
American professional sports have been playing in the same city and same 
league continuously and uninterrupted since the 19th century: the Rochester 
Red Wings, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh 
Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals. He also reports that the Red Wings and 
the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League are the only two 
franchises in North American professional sports to have captured a league 
championship[a] in every decade of the 20th century.[citation needed] The 
current franchise has been playing in Rochester since 1899, when the team 
was known as the Rochester Bronchos and won the Eastern League championship 
in its inaugural season.[1] The Red Wings became the Triple-A affiliate 
of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1929. Aside from the affiliation, the Cardinals 
also owned the Wings and their stadium, then known as Red Wing Stadium. 
The early years of the Cardinals and Red Wings saw the Red Wings very much 
a power house, not unlike their parent club. The team was managed by Billy 
Southworth (who split time managing the team in 1929 with Bill McKechnie),and 
from 1929–1931, the team won the International League championship. In 
a true statement of how dominant a team they were, they won 103 games in 
1929, 105 games in 1930, and 101 games in 1931.[2] The team would remain 
competitive for many years, with 1935 and 1937 being the only years that 
they lost more games than they won. The return of Billy Southworth in 1939 
brought another league championship to Rochester.[2] Lean times were ahead 
for Rochester, with the 1940s finding the Red Wings on the bottom half 
of the standings. Even former famed pitcher Burleigh Grimes couldn't change 
the team's fortunes. He lasted a little more than a season and a half when 
he was replaced by Benny Borgmann.[2] The team would capture three more 
league championships in the Cardinals era, those coming in 1952, 1955, 
and 1956.[2] In the fall of 1956, the Cardinals ceased to operate the Red 
Wings and put both the team and the stadium up for sale. In response, Morrie 
Silver, a Rochester businessman, formed Rochester Community Baseball, Inc. 
(RCB) and spearheaded a drive to sell shares in RCB to raise money to buy 
the Red Wings and Red Wing Stadium to ensure that the franchise would remain 
in Rochester. The attempt was successful as RCB purchased both entities 
from the Cardinals on February 27, 1957, in an event that was dubbed the 
"72 Day Miracle". RCB, composed of fans of the team as shareholders, continues 
to own and operate the club to this day, making the Red Wings one of a 
very few current American professional sports franchises that are publicly 
owned. The Green Bay Packers of the National Football League are the most 
notable example of this distinction. In 1959, the Red Wings were involved 
in one of minor league baseball's most infamous games. While playing in 
Havana, Cuba, the Red Wings' July 25 game against the Havana Sugar Kings 
was interrupted at midnight by gunfire and fireworks in celebration of 
the 26th of July Movement.[3] Rochester's Frank Verdi, standing in as third-base 
coach in place of manager Cot Deal, who had been ejected earlier in the 
game, was grazed by a bullet, as was Leo Cárdenas, the Sugar Kings' shortstop.[3] 
Neither player was seriously injured, but both the game and then the series 
were canceled.[3] The Wings remained St. Louis' affiliate until 1960, when 
the Red Wings moved on to become the top farm club of the Baltimore Orioles. 
After two straight fourth-place finishes, and early exits from the playoffs, 
the Red Wings dismissed Clyde King, a hold over from the Cardinals era, 
as manager of the team, and named Darrell Johnson in his place. Johnson 
never managed a finish better than fourth during his tenure, however, in 
1964, with an 82-72 record, Johnson's Red Wings managed to win yet another 
championship.[2] He was replaced by Earl Weaver, who showed great promise 
as a manager. After two seasons, Weaver was brought up to manage the Baltimore 
Orioles, and he was replaced by Billy DeMars, who lasted one season before 
being replaced by Cal Ripken, Sr. After two seasons, Ripken was replaced 
by Joe Altobelli. Red Wing Stadium was renamed Silver Stadium in honor 
of Morrie Silver on August 19, 1968. From 1971-1976, the Red Wings never 
missed the playoffs, capturing two more league titles in the process in 
1971 and 1974.[2] Altobelli returned to the Red Wings after his retirement 
from the coaching ranks, serving as general manager from late 1991 to 1994 
and then as part of the radio broadcasting team through 2008. 1978 was 
a terrible season for the Red Wings, as the club had three managers, Ken 
Boyer, Al Widmar, and Frank Robinson. The team finished 68-72. Robinson 
was replaced by Doc Edwards, who managed to get the team to the playoffs 
in 1980, but could not manage a league title. Edwards was soon gone, a 
replaced by Lance Nicholls, who in turn, was replaced by former Tidewater 
Tides manager Frank Verdi.[2] The team did horrible under Verdi, and was 
mainly stocked with cast off former major leaguers, career minor league 
players, and very few prospects. The only bonafide major league prospect 
on the team during this lean period was Larry Sheets, who was mainly a 
journeyman hitter during his career. Verdi was fired midway through 1985, 
with the Red Wings at 18-40. Under his replacement, first base coach Mark 
Wiley, the Red Wings went 40-41 the rest of the season.[2] There would 
be a return to glory, when the Red Wings named John Hart as the new manager. 
He was able to guide the team into the playoffs during his two-year stint, 
but none resulted in a championship. However, Hart impressed the Orioles, 
and he was soon off to the majors. His replacement was former New York 
Yankees catcher Johnny Oates. Oates won the league title in his first year 
and only year at the helm. His replacement was Greg Biagini. In 1990, Biagini 
led a loaded Red Wings team, which featured future Red Sox hero Curt Schilling, 
to the league championship. In 1993, the Red Wings, guided by manager Bob 
Miscik, reached the International League finals but lost to the Charlotte 
Knights in five games. In 1997, the Red Wings moved into the new Frontier 
Field in downtown Rochester after 68 seasons at Silver Stadium on the city's 
northeast side. That same year, manager Marv Foley led the Wings to a league 
title.[2] In 2000, during the team's fourth year at the stadium, the Red 
Wings played host to the Triple-A All-Star Game. Rochester won six Governors' 
Cup titles during their 42-year affiliation with the Orioles, with the 
last coming in 1997. The team's fortunes began to decline by 1999, though, 
as the product on the field slipped in quality. By 2002, the fifth consecutive 
losing season for Rochester and what would be the last year of the player 
development agreement between Baltimore and Rochester, the team's record 
slipped to a league-worst 55–89. The Red Wings' affiliation with the Orioles 
ended when it signed a working agreement with the Minnesota Twins on September 
17, 2002.[4] The Red Wings' first season as the Twins' Triple-A affiliate 
was the team's sixth consecutive losing season. Beginning in 2004, however, 
the team began to turn their fortunes around. In both 2004 and 2005, the 
Red Wings finished in second place in the North Division with records of 
73–71 and 75–69, respectively. The turnaround was capped in 2006 when Rochester, 
now under the leadership of Stan Cliburn, advanced to the International 
League playoffs as the Wild Card with a record of 79–64. The Red Wings 
then beat the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons three games to one in the 
best-of-five semifinal series but lost to the Toledo Mud Hens in five games, 
three games to two, in the best-of-five Governors' Cup series. Rochester 
followed up their run to the 2006 Governors' Cup Finals by posting a winning 
record in each of the next two seasons, bringing the streak of consecutive 
winning seasons to five. In 2008, the team went 74–70 after being as far 
as 13 games under .500 at one point (19–32 on May 25). The streak was snapped 
in 2009 after the team finished 70–74. On September 21, 2009, the Minnesota 
Twins announced that they would not renew manager Stan Cliburn's contract 
for the 2010 season. According to Twins farm director Jim Rantz, the change 
was made as part of an "overall directional change that is being implemented 
throughout the minor-league system."[5] Former New Britain Rock Cats manager 
Tom Nieto was Cliburn's replacement.[6] Nieto was fired at the close of 
the 2011 season after leading the Red Wings to their first back-to-back 
90-loss seasons since 1903–04.[7] On November 25, 2011 Gene Glynn was announced 
as the new Red Wings manager for 2012.[8] The 2012 season saw the Red Wings 
scratch out a .500 record, considered a vast improvement over the Nieto 
years. With Glynn continuing as manager, the 2013 Wings got off to a dismal 
2–11 start, but slowly improved before turning red-hot in July. At some 
points they led the North Division, but a late surge by Pawtucket relegated 
the Wings to a fight for the IL's lone wild card spot. They secured the 
wild card on the last day of the season, based on a tiebreaker with the 
Norfolk Tides, leading the Wings to their first postseason appearance since 
2006. The following season's playoff push came down to the final series 
of the year in Pawtucket, but a loss on August 31 put them out of the picture 
for good.[9] After the 2014 season, Gene Glynn was promoted to become the 
third base coach for the major league Minnesota Twins.[10] To replace Glynn, 
the Red Wings announced on January 30, 2015 that former Chicago Cubs' manager 
Mike Quade would be taking over for the 2015 season.[11] The Red Wings 
have played for the Governors' Cup, the championship of the International 
League, 21 times, winning 10. Both numbers are IL records. Pitchers Catchers

uniform numbers: Altobelli's number 26 and the number 8,222 representing 
Silver were both retired prior to the final regular season game at Silver
