The Black Aces are a group of black pitchers who have won at least 20 Major 
League Baseball games in a single season. The term comes from the title 
of a book written by former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher Mudcat 
Grant, one of the members of the group.[1] In the first years after the 
desegregation of MLB, teams who drafted African American pitchers often 
converted them into position players; few were allowed to continue pitching.[2] 
Grant is the first African American 20-game winner in American League history.[3] 
Two members of the Black Aces, Bob Gibson and Ferguson Jenkins, are members 
of the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The group has organized formally 
to promote their successes and encourage the development of future black 
players.[4] Some black pitchers from Latin America, notably Luis Tiant, 
have expressed disappointment that they are not included in this group.[5] 
Meanwhile, Ferguson Jenkins is a Black Canadian, although he can trace 
his ancestry to escaped U.S. slaves. The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum 
had a traveling exhibit honoring the Black Aces.[6] The Black Aces were 
celebrated at McAfee Coliseum in 2007.[3][7] In 2005, Dontrelle Willis 
won 22 games.[8] CC Sabathia won 21 games in 2010.[9] David Price won 20
