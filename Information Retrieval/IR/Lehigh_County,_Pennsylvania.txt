Lehigh County is a county located in the Lehigh Valley region of the U.S. 
state of Pennsylvania. As of the 2010 census, the population was 349,497.[1] 
Its county seat is Allentown, the state's third largest city behind Philadelphia 
and Pittsburgh.[2] The county, which was first settled around 1730, was 
formed in 1812 with the division of Northampton County into two counties. 
It is named after the Lehigh River, whose name is derived from the Delaware 
Indian term Lechauweki or Lechauwekink, meaning "where there are forks".[3] 
Lehigh County is included in the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ Metropolitan 
Statistical Area, which is also included in the New York City-Newark, New 
Jersey, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area. It is currently the fastest 
growing county in Pennsylvania and among the fastest growing nationwide, 
ranking in the 79th percentile overall for the 2010 to 2012 time period.[4] 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 348 
square miles (900 km2), of which 345 square miles (890 km2) is land and 
3.1 square miles (8.0 km2) (0.9%) is water.[5] The Lehigh Valley, which 
includes all of Lehigh and Northampton counties, is bounded on the north 
by Blue Mountain, a ridge of the Appalachian mountain range with an altitude 
of 1,300 to 1,604 feet (489 m), and on the south by South Mountain, a ridge 
of 700 to 1,100 feet (340 m) that cuts through the southern portions of 
the two counties. The highest point in Lehigh County is Bake Oven Knob, 
a mass of Tuscarora conglomeratic rocks that rise about 100 feet (30 m) 
above the main ridge of the Blue Mountain in northwestern Heidelberg Township.[6] 
Lehigh County is in the Delaware River watershed. While most of the county 
is drained by the Lehigh River and its tributaries, the Schuylkill River 
also drains regions in the south of the county via the Perkiomen Creek 
and the northwest via the Maiden Creek. Most of the county's climate is 
considered to fall in the humid continental climate zone. Summers are typically 
hot and muggy, fall and spring are generally mild, and winter is cold.

and neighboring Northampton County are part of Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional 
district. The 15th Congressional district is a contentious swing district 
with neither Republicans nor Democrats winning the district consistently. 
Despite the advantage in Democratic registration in the district, voters 
elected Republicans Charlie Dent in 2004, 2006 and 2008 and, previously, 
Pat Toomey in 1998, 2000, and 2002. In 2004, the county narrowly voted 
for John Kerry over George W. Bush for President, and in 2008 the county 
gave all statewide Democratic candidates significant leads and Barack Obama 
a victory of more than 15 points over John McCain, 57.1% to 41.5%. In 2012, 
President Obama carried the county again, but by a narrower margin: 53.17% 
to 45.52%.[20] All five statewide winners carried it in November 2004. 
Although the Republican Party has historically been dominant in county-level 
politics, the Democratic Party has made substantial inroads this decade. 
In 2005, Bethlehem Mayor Don Cunningham unseated incumbent County Executive 
Jane Ervin to become the first Democrat to be elected to the office. Four 
of the nine commissioner seats and all row offices except for the District 
Attorney have held by Democrats since winning two at-large seats in November 
2007. Lehigh County has a home-rule charter with four at-large and five 
district commissioners. In 2006 Lehigh County voters approved a county-charter 
amendment to combine the offices of Clerk of Courts, Register of Wills, 
and Recorder of Deeds into the office of the Clerk of Judicial Records. 
Clerk of Courts Andrea Naugle won the new office in November 2007. Lehigh

Township. The county is also served by Allentown Queen City Municipal Airport, 
a two-runway general aviation facility located off of Allentown's Lehigh

only by the 215 area code from 1947 (when the North American Numbering 
Plan of the Bell System went into effect) until 1994. With the county's 
growing population, however, Lehigh County areas were afforded area code 
610 in 1994. Today, Lehigh County is covered by 610. An overlay area code, 
484, was added to the 610 service area in 1999.[22] A plan to introduce 
area code 835 as an additional overlay was rescinded in 2001.[23] Most 
municipalities in the county have set aside at least some land for public
