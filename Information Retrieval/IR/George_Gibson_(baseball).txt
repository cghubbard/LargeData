As Player As Manager George C. Gibson (July 22, 1880 – January 25, 1967), 
nicknamed Mooney, was a Canadian professional baseball player, coach, scout 
and manager.[1] He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball from 1905 
to 1918 during a period in baseball history known as the Dead-ball era. 
Gibson spent the majority of his athletic career with the Pittsburgh Pirates 
before serving as a player-coach for the New York Giants for his final 
two seasons. He later became a minor league manager for the Toronto Maple 
Leafs before returning to the major leagues as a manager for the Pirates 
and the Chicago Cubs.[2] Gibson was regarded as one of the National League's 
premier catchers because of his impressive defensive skills and his strong, 
accurate throwing arm.[3][4] He was also known for his smart pitch-calling 
and his ability to hold runners on base.[5] His reputation as a defensive 
stand out is enhanced because of the era in which he played. In the deadball 
era, catchers played a huge defensive role, given the large number of bunts 
and stolen base attempts, as well as the difficulty of handling the spitball 
pitchers who dominated pitching staffs.[6] He had to catch every type of 
pitch imaginable, such as shine balls, spitballs, knuckleballs, and emory 
balls.[6] Gibson was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1958 
and the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987.[5][7] Born a stone's throw 
away from Tecumseh Park (today's Labatt Memorial Park) in London, Ontario, 
Gibson gained the nickname "Mooney" as a youngster.[8] Some sources suggest 
that the nickname was inspired by his round, moon-shaped face, while other 
sources claim he picked up the nickname because he had played on a sandlot 
team known as the Mooneys.[3][8] He began his professional baseball career 
in 1903 with the Kingston Colonials of the Hudson River League but, after 
only 38 games his contract was purchased by the Buffalo Bisons of the Eastern 
League, managed by George Stallings.[9] He then spent two seasons playing 
for the Montreal Royals before his contract was purchased by the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in June 1905.[1] Gibson made his major league debut July 2, 1905 
at the age of 24.[1] Gibson stood 5'11.5" and weighed 190 pounds, which 
was considered large for a baseball player of his era.[3] Although he did 
not provide prolific offensive statistics, he did provide excellent defensive 
abilities and was a keen student of baseball strategy under the tutelage 
of Pirates manager Fred Clarke.[3] The Pirates finished in second place 
three times in four seasons between 1905 and 1908. During the 1908 season, 
they were involved in a tight pennant race with the Chicago Cubs and the 
New York Giants. The Pirates were in first place going into the final day 
of the season but lost their final game to the eventual National League 
champion Chicago Cubs.[10] Gibson was in his prime during the 1909 season 
when he caught in 134 consecutive games, breaking the previous record of 
133 consecutive games played as a catcher set by Deacon McGuire in 1895.[11] 
He set another major league record for games played in a season by a catcher 
with 150, which was also previously held by McGuire since 1895.[3][12][13] 
His games caught in a season record stood until 1920 when Ray Schalk caught 
151 games.[14] His record of 134 consecutive games caught would stand until 
1940 when it was broken by Ray Mueller.[15] Gibson hit a double for the 
final hit in the last game played at Pittsburgh's Exposition Park on June 
29, 1909 and the following day had the first hit in the new Forbes Field.[3] 
Gibson had a career-high 52 runs batted in and helped guide the Pirates' 
pitching staff to finish second in the league in shutouts as well as in 
earned run average as the team clinched the 1909 National League pennant.[1][16] 
He also led National League catchers in fielding percentage, baserunners 
caught stealing and in caught stealing percentage.[17] Gibson then went 
on to catch every game in the 1909 World Series as the Pirates defeated 
the Detroit Tigers in seven games to win the world championship.[12][18] 
Gibson held Detroit's Ty Cobb, the premier base stealer of his era, to 
only one stolen base during the series (Cobb also stole home plate during 
the series which wasn't charged against Gibson).[19] Arriving back at the 
train station in his hometown of London, Ontario, on October 27, 1909, 
after winning the World Series, Gibson found more than 7,000 cheering fans 
to greet him.[8] At the time, the population of London was approximately 
35,000.[8] Gibson was a workhorse during his career with the Pirates, leading 
National League catchers in games played for four consecutive seasons between 
1907 and 1910.[1] When Gibson began his major league career career, most 
catchers were large, bulky men, however as baseball progressed during the 
Deadball era, the decrease in run production placed greater significance 
on stolen bases and bunts, which in turn emphasized the crucial defensive 
role played by catchers.[20] As the sport evolved, teams began to field 
smaller, more agile players as catchers, typified by the emergence of Ray 
Schalk.[20] A newspaper article of the day referred to Gibson as being 
part of the "dreadnought" type.[20] He suffered a broken ankle in late-April 
of 1913 and missed two months of the season.[21] Gibson returned to hit 
for a career-high .285 batting average in 102 games during the 1914 season.[1] 
In August 1916 the 36-year-old Gibson was placed on waivers and claimed 
by the New York Giants, but he refused to report that year.[22] Giants 
manager John McGraw persuaded him to join the Giants as a player-coach 
in 1917.[3] Gibson played in his final major league game on August 20, 
1918 at the age of 38.[1] In a fourteen-year major league career, Gibson 
played in 1,213 games, accumulating 893 hits in 3,776 at bats for a .236 
career batting average along with 15 home runs, 346 runs batted in and 
an on-base percentage of .295.[1] He had a .977 career fielding percentage 
as a catcher which was 7 points higher than the league average for catchers 
during his career.[1] He led all National League catchers in fielding percentage 
three times (1909, 1910, and 1912). Gibson caught 124 shutouts during his 
career, ranking him 7th all-time among major league catchers.[23] Gibson 
was the Pirates catcher on September 20, 1907, when pitcher Nick Maddox 
threw a no-hitter against the Brooklyn Superbas.[24] In his book, The Bill 
James Historical Baseball Abstract, baseball historian Bill James ranked 
Gibson 95th all-time among major league catchers.[25] Gibson accepted a 
coaching position with the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League 
in 1918.[3] The 1918 season closed early because of World War I, however, 
and Gibson returned to Canada until he was hired in 1919 to coach the Toronto 
Maple Leafs of the International League.[3] In December 1919, Gibson was 
named the new manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates.[26] He served as their 
manager from 1920 to 1922.[2] He then spent the 1923 season as a coach 
for the Washington Senators.[3] In 1925, he became coach for the Chicago 
Cubs but finished the season as manager after Rabbit Maranville was dismissed.[27] 
He then became a scout for the Cubs until he was named the Pirates manager 
again in 1932.[3][28] Although Gibson recorded a .546 winning percentage 
as a manager, he was intolerant of team mistakes and his temperament left 
him ill-suited for the task of team politics.[3] In June 1934 the Pirates 
replaced Gibson with Pie Traynor.[29] On May 9, 1921, under manager George 
Gibson, the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the London Tecumsehs 8–7 at Tecumseh 
Park before 3,500 people in an exhibition baseball game.[8] Before the 
game, Gibson and his team was presented with a silver loving cup by the 
London Kiwanis Club.[citation needed] Gibson thrilled the locals by catching 
the opening inning with his 1909 battery-mate Babe Adams and singling and 
scoring a run in his lone at-bat. London Mayor Sid Little entertained the 
team that evening at his home.[citation needed] Gibson was named Canada's 
baseball player of the half century in 1958 and was the first baseball 
player elected to Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.[5] He was subsequently 
inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame & Museum in 1987 and was 
one of the inaugural 10 inductees into the London Sports Hall of Fame in 
2001.[7] In February 1955 while organizers were planning the charter season 
of the Eager Beaver Baseball Association, Gibson was named "honorary lifetime 
president."[citation needed] Today, there is a commemorative plaque prominently 
displayed at the entrance to the main grandstand at Labatt Park in Gibson's 
honour.[8] An interview of Gibson was included as a chapter in the baseball 
book, The Glory of Their Times, written by Lawrence Ritter.[30] When Gibson 
lived at 252 Central Avenue in London during the 1920s and 1930s, his immediate 
neighbours to the east were members of the Labatt brewing family, with 
whom Gibson frequently socialized.[citation needed] It is believed that 
Gibson played a significant role in the decision by John and Hugh Labatt 
to purchase Tecumseh Park and donate it to the City (along with $10,000 
for repairs and maintenance), which occurred on December 31, 1936, after 
which Tecumseh Park was officially renamed "The John Labatt Memorial Athletic 
Park."[citation needed] Gibson died at age 86 in London and is buried at 
Campbell Cemetery in Komoka, Ontario, not far from his Delaware farm.[3] 
Near Gibson's former farm is a road named in his honour after Gibson donated 
some land for public use to the area conservation authority of the day.[citation 
needed] Gibson was the nephew of William Southam, founder of Southam Newspapers, 
the brother of Richard Southam, manager of the London Tecumsehs, and the 
father-in-law of Bill Warwick, a major league baseball player in the 1920s.[citation
