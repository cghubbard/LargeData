The Brooklyn Bushwicks were an independent, semi-professional baseball 
team that played its games almost totally in Dexter Park in Queens from 
1917 to 1951. They were unique at their time for fielding multi-ethnic 
rosters. They played what amounts to exhibition games against barnstorming 
Negro league teams, minor league baseball teams, and other semi-pro teams. 
The Bushwicks were owned by Max Rosner, who hired many former major league 
to play on his club, including Dazzy Vance and others. All the famous players 
of the time came to play exhibitions at Dexter Park including Dizzy Dean, 
Hank Greenberg, Joe DiMaggio, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Joe Medwick. Until 
he became friends with Rosner, Ruth demanded upfront payments in cash before 
agreeing to personal appearances. The DiMaggio picture was taken during 
his debut year with Yankees. The great black stars, Josh Gibson, Cool Papa 
Bell and many others often opposed the Bushwicks. The team appeared on 
New York City television and on radio as well. The team's picture appeared 
in three different Spaulding Guides. A book on the Bushwicks by Thomas
