Reginald Laverne Sanders (born December 1, 1967) is a former right fielder 
in Major League Baseball. He bats and throws right-handed. Sanders was 
24 years old when he made his major league debut on August 22, 1991, after 
being selected in the 7th round of the 1987 amateur draft by the Cincinnati 
Reds. He attended Spartanburg Methodist College before beginning his pro 
career with the Rookie-level Billings Mustangs of the Pioneer League in 
1988. He also played professionally with the St. Louis Cardinals, Pittsburgh 
Pirates, Atlanta Braves, San Francisco Giants, San Diego Padres and Kansas 
City Royals, and was a member of the Arizona Diamondbacks' 2001 World Series 
championship over the New York Yankees. With the Cardinals, Sanders had 
a breakout of sorts during the 2005 National League Division Series against 
the San Diego Padres. In a three-game sweep of the Padres, Sanders had 
10 runs batted in, a new record for a division series. Sanders gained some 
notoriety during the 1994 season when Pedro Martinez hit him with a pitch 
to end his bid for a perfect game with one out in the eighth inning. Sanders 
responded by charging the mound and igniting a bench-clearing brawl. He 
was ridiculed by some in the press for believing that a pitcher would abandon 
an attempt at a perfect game to intentionally hit a batter.[1] On June 
10, 2006, as a member of the Royals, Reggie hit his 300th home run. This 
made him the fifth member of Major League Baseball's 300-300 club, as he 
had stolen the 300th base of his career on May 1, and had gotten his 302nd 
career stolen base just a day earlier. He became the first player in history 
to join the club at his home stadium. Steve Finley of the San Francisco 
Giants joined the 300-300 club as its sixth member on June 14, four days 
after Sanders achieved the feat. Sanders hit 20 or more home runs in one 
season for five different National League teams. He hit at least 10 home 
runs in a season for every major league team he played for (seven in all).[2] 
Sanders missed the majority of the 2007 season due to an injury and became
