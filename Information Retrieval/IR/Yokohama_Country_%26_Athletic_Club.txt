The Yokohama Country & Athletic Club, is a sport and recreational club 
located in Yamate, Yokohama. First founded in 1868 by Scottish cricketer 
James Pender Mollison (21 July 1844 - 22 November 1931) as the Yokohama 
Cricket Club. In 1884 members voted to absorb the Yokohama Foot Ball Club 
(Rugby Union), Athletics, Baseball and Tennis clubs to form the Yokohama 
Country & Athletic Club (YC&AC) as it is now known.[1] Although the first 
recorded cricket match in Japan was played in Yokohama on June 25th 1863 
between a Royal Navy team and members of the local merchant community,[2][3] 
the Yokohama Cricket Club was one of Japan's first organized cricket teams 
and was the center of many recreational and sporting facilities for English 
merchants living in Yokohama. The club's first facilities were at a location 
known as the Swamp Ground, but in 1870 the club moved to a larger 120 acre 
plot and played matches in a location that now hosts the Yokohama Stadium.[4] 
By the 1880's sufficient numbers of American's had joined the club for 
baseball to supplant cricket in terms of popularity.[5][6] Prior to the 
1890's the club upheld restrictive membership policies that excluded the 
use of the club's facilities to Japanese nationals. Resentment of these 
rules and the extraterritoriality enjoyed by foreign nationals in the treaty 
ports prompted a formal challenge in 1891 by a team from Ichikō, the elite 
University of Tokyo preparatory school.[7] After five years of prevarication 
and delay, on the 29 May 1896 a historic match took place where the amateur 
YC&AC club side was convincingly beaten 29 - 4. A hurriedly arranged rematch 
on June 5, led to further humiliation for the club, with a loss of 32 - 
9 to the less experienced Japanese high school team.[8] After one further 
defeat of 22 - 6, players from the visiting US Navy ship USS Olympia were 
drafted to assist, and a narrow consolation victory for the club of 14 
- 12 was achieved.[9] As one of the first truly international baseball 
matches to be played in Japan, where a local team 'beat the foreigners 
at their own game', the Ichikō high school team was lauded in the contemporary 
press as national heroes. News of this victory greatly contributed to the 
popularity of baseball as a school sport in Japan.[10] The club's rugby 
activities include the Gareth MacFadyen Cup, a perpetual local derby-style 
memorial rugby union match contested on an annual basis since 2001 in Tokyo 
between the Tokyo Crusaders and the Yokohama Country and Athletic Club. 
In 1910 the club vacated its facilities in downtown Yokohama and relocated 
to an elevated site at Yaguchidai close to the current Yamate Station on 
the JR East Negishi Line. Current facilities provide for a wide variety 
of indoor and outdoor sports including tennis, rugby, cricket, football,
