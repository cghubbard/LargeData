Princeton is a municipality with a borough form of government in Mercer 
County, New Jersey, United States, that was established in its current 
form on January 1, 2013, through the consolidation of the Borough of Princeton 
and Princeton Township. As of the 2010 United States Census, the municipality's 
population was 28,572, reflecting the former township's population of 16,265, 
along with the 12,307 in the former borough.[7][8][9][10][11] Princeton 
was founded before the American Revolution and is best known as the location 
of Princeton University, located in the community since 1756. Although 
its association with the university is primarily what makes Princeton a 
college town, other important institutions in the area include the Institute 
for Advanced Study, Westminster Choir College, Princeton Plasma Physics 
Laboratory, Princeton Theological Seminary, Opinion Research Corporation, 
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Siemens Corporate Research, SRI International, FMC 
Corporation, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Amrep, Church and Dwight, 
Berlitz International, and Dow Jones & Company. Princeton is roughly equidistant 
from New York City and Philadelphia. Princeton is close to many major highways 
that serve both cities, and receives major television and radio broadcasts 
from each. New Jersey's capital is the city of Trenton, but the governor's 
official residence has been in Princeton since 1945, when Morven in the 
borough became the first Governor's mansion. It was later replaced by the 
larger Drumthwacket, a colonial mansion located in the former Township. 
Morven became a museum property of the New Jersey Historical Society. Princeton 
was ranked 15th of the top 100 towns in the United States to Live and Work 
In by Money Magazine in 2005.[16] Although residents of Princeton (Princetonians) 
traditionally have a strong community-wide identity, the community had 
been composed of two separate municipalities: a township and a borough. 
The central borough was completely surrounded by the township. The Borough 
seceded from the Township in 1894 in a dispute over school taxes; the two 
municipalities later formed the Princeton Public Schools, and some other 
public services were conducted together before they were reunited into 
a single Princeton in January 2013. The Borough contained Nassau Street, 
the main commercial street, most of the University campus, and incorporated 
most of the urban area until the postwar suburbanization. The Borough and 
Township had roughly equal populations. The Lenni Lenape Native Americans 
were the earliest identifiable inhabitants of the Princeton area. Europeans 
founded their settlement in the latter part of the 17th century. The first 
European to find his home in the boundaries of the future town was Henry 
Greenland. He built his house in 1683 along with a tavern. In this drinking 
hole representatives of West Jersey and East Jersey met to set boundaries 
for the location of the township.[17] Originally, Princeton was known only 
as part of nearby Stony Brook. James Leonard first referred to the town 
as Princetown,[when?] when describing the location of his large estate 
in his diary.[18] The town bore a variety of names subsequently, including: 
Princetown, Prince's Town and finally Princeton.[19] Although there is 
no official documentary backing, the town is considered to be named after 
King William III, Prince William of Orange of the House of Nassau.[20] 
Another theory suggests that the name came from a large land-owner named 
Henry Prince, but no evidence backs this contention.[19] A royal prince 
seems a more likely eponym for the settlement, as three nearby towns had 
similar names: Kingston, Queenstown (in the vicinity of the intersection 
of Nassau and Harrison Streets) and Princessville (Lawrence Township).[18] 
When Richard Stockton, one of the founders of the township, died in 1709 
he left his estate to his sons, who helped to expand property and the population. 
Based on the 1880 United States Census, the population of the town comprised 
3,209 persons (not including students).[18] Local population has expanded 
from the nineteenth century. According to the 2010 Census, Princeton Borough 
had 12,307 inhabitants, while Princeton Township had 16,265.[22][23] The 
numbers have become stagnant; since the establishment of Princeton University 
in 1756, the town's population spikes every year during the fall and winter 
and drops significantly over the course of the summer.[18] Aside from housing 
the University of the same name, the settlement suffered the revolutionary 
Battle of Princeton on its soil. After the victory in 1777, the town hosted 
the first Legislature under the State Constitution of New Jersey to decide 
the State's seal, Governor and organization of its government. In addition, 
two of the original signers of the Declaration of Independence—Richard 
Stockton and John Witherspoon lived in Princeton.[18] Princetonians honored 
their citizens' legacy by naming two streets in the downtown area after 
them. On January 10, 1938 Henry Ewing Hale called for a group of citizens 
to discuss opening a "Historical Society of Princeton." Later the Bainbridge 
House would be dedicated for this purpose. Previously the house was used 
once for a meeting of Continental Congress in 1783, a general office and 
as the Princeton Public Library. The House is actually property of Princeton 
University and is leased to the Princeton Historical Society for one dollar 
per year.[24] The house has kept its original staircase, flooring and paneled 
walls. All together, 70% of the house has been unaltered. Aside from safety 
features like wheelchair access and electrical work, the house was merely 
restored to its original look. During the most stirring events in its history, 
Princeton was a wide spot in the road; the boundary between Somerset County 
and Middlesex County ran right through Princeton, along the high road between 
New York and Philadelphia, now Nassau Street. When Mercer County was formed 
in 1838, part of West Windsor Township was added to the portion of Montgomery 
Township which was included in the new county, and made into Princeton 
Township; the area between the present borough line and the Delaware and 
Raritan Canal was added to Princeton Township in 1853. Princeton Borough 
became a separate municipality in 1894. In the early nineteenth century, 
New Jersey boroughs had been parish bodies, chartered within existing townships. 
Princeton Borough received such a charter in 1813, as part of Montgomery 
and West Windsor Townships; it continued to be part of Princeton Township 
until the Act of 1894, which required that each township form a single 
school district; rather than do so, Princeton Borough petitioned to be 
separated. (The two Princetons now form the Princeton Public Schools.) 
Two minor boundary changes united the then site of the Princeton Hospital 
and of the Princeton Regional High School inside the Borough, in 1928 and 
1951 respectively.[25] According to the United States Census Bureau, Princeton 
has a total area of 18.363 square miles (68.041 km2), including 17.932 
square miles (46.444 km2) of land (97.65%) and 0.431 square miles (1.115 km2) 
of water (2.35%).[26] Cedar Grove,[27] Port Mercer, North Princeton, Princeton 
Basin, and Jugtown are unincorporated communities that have been absorbed 
into Greater Princeton over the years, but still maintain their own community 
identity.[28] The borough borders Hopewell Township, Lawrence and West 
Windsor Townships in Mercer County; Plainsboro Township and South Brunswick 
Township in Middlesex County; and Franklin Township and Montgomery Township 
in Somerset County.[29] United States Postal ZIP codes for Princeton include 
08540, 08541 (Educational Testing Service), 08542 (largely the old Borough), 
08543 (PO boxes), and 08544 (the University). As of the 2010 United States 
Census, the borough and township had a combined population of 28,572.[7][10] 
Princeton is governed under the Borough form of New Jersey municipal government. 
The governing body consists of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising 
six council members, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan 
basis as part of the November general election. A Mayor is elected directly 
by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consists 
of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, 
with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. 
The Borough form of government used by Princeton, the most common system 
used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which 
council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at 
meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances 
subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The 
mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and 
most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of 
the council.[31][32][33] The Mayor is elected directly by the voters to 
a four-year term of office, serves as the borough's chief executive officer 
and nominates appointees to various boards and commissions subject to approval 
of the Borough Council. The Mayor presides at the Borough Council meetings 
and votes in the case of a tie or a few other specific cases.[33] The Borough 
Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a 
staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year 
cycle. The Council has administrative powers and is the policy-making body 
of the Borough. The Council approves appointments made by the Mayor. Council 
Members serve on various boards and committees and act as liaison's to 
certain Departments, Committees or Boards.[33] As of 2016[update], the 
Mayor of Princeton is Democrat Liz Lempert, whose term of office ends December 
31, 2016.[3] Members of the Princeton Borough Council are Council President 
Bernard P. "Bernie" Miller (D, 2017), Jo Butler (D, 2017), Jenny Crumiller 
(D, 2016), Heather H. Howard (D, 2018), Arden "Lance" Liverman (D, 2018) 
and Patrick Simon (D, 2016).[34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41] On November 
8, 2011, the residents of both the Borough of Princeton and the Township 
of Princeton voted to merge the two municipalities into one. In Princeton 
Borough 1,385 voted for, 902 voted against while in Princeton Township 
3,542 voted for and 604 voted against. Proponents of the merger asserted 
that when the merger is completed the new municipality of Princeton will 
save $3.2 million as a result of some scaled down services including layoffs 
of 15 government workers including 9 police officers (however the measure 
itself does not mandate such layoffs). Opponents of the measure challenged 
the findings of a report citing a cost savings as unsubstantiated, and 
noted that voter representation would be reduced in a smaller government 
structure.[42] The consolidation took effect on January 1, 2013.[43] Princeton 
is located in the 12th Congressional District[44] and is part of New Jersey's 
16th state legislative district.[8][45][46] Prior to the 2011 reapportionment 
following the 2010 Census, the former Princeton Borough and Princeton Township 
had both been in the 15th state legislative district.[47] New Jersey's 
Twelfth Congressional District is represented by Bonnie Watson Coleman 
(D, Ewing Township).[48] New Jersey is represented in the United States 
Senate by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term ends 2021)[49] and Bob Menendez 
(D, Paramus, 2019).[50][51] For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General 
Assembly), the 16th Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature 
is represented in the State Senate by Christopher Bateman (R, Somerville) 
and in the General Assembly by Jack Ciattarelli (R, Hillsborough Township) 
and Andrew Zwicker (D, South Brunswick). [52] The Governor of New Jersey 
is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[53] The Lieutenant Governor of 
New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[54] Mercer County is governed 
by a County Executive who oversees the day-to-day operations of the county 
and by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders that acts in a legislative 
capacity, setting policy. All officials are chosen at-large in partisan 
elections, with the executive serving a four-year term of office while 
the freeholders serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, 
with either two or three seats up for election each year.[55] As of 2014[update], 
the County Executive is Brian M. Hughes (D, term ends December 31, 2015; 
Princeton).[56] Mercer County's Freeholders are Freeholder Chair Andrew 
Koontz (D, 2016; Princeton),[57] Freeholder Vice Chair Samuel T. Frisby, 
Sr. (2015; Trenton),[58] Ann M. Cannon (2015; East Windsor Township),[59] 
Anthony P. Carabelli (2016; Trenton),[60] John A. Cimino (2014, Hamilton 
Township),[61] Pasquale "Pat" Colavita, Jr. (2015; Lawrence Township)[62] 
and Lucylle R. S. Walter (2014; Ewing Township)[63][64][65] Mercer County's 
constitutional officers are County Clerk Paula Sollami-Covello (D, 2015),[66] 
Sheriff John A. Kemler (D, 2014)[67] and Surrogate Diane Gerofsky (D, 2016).[68][69] 
As of March 23, 2011, there were a total of 18,049 registered voters in 
Princeton (a sum of the former borough and township's voters), of which 
9,184 (50.9%) were registered as Democrats, 2,140 (11.9%) were registered 
as Republicans and 6,703 (37.1%) were registered as Unaffiliated. There 
were 22 voters registered to other parties.[70] In the 2012 presidential 
election, Democrat Barack Obama received 75.4% of the vote (9,461 cast), 
ahead of Republican Mitt Romney with 23.0% (2,882 votes), and other candidates 
with 1.6% (205 votes), among the 14,752 ballots cast by the municipality's 
20,328 registered voters (2,204 ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 
72.6%.[71][72] In the 2013 gubernatorial election, Democrat Barbara Buono 
received 58.8% of the vote (4,172 cast), ahead of Republican Chris Christie 
with 39.2% (2,780 votes), and other candidates with 2.0% (145 votes), among 
the 7,279 ballots cast by the municipality's 18,374 registered voters (182 
ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 39.6%.[73][74] Like most of the 
Northeastern United States, Princeton has a humid continental climate, 
and generally sees cold winters and hot, humid summers. According to Weather.com, 
the lowest recorded temperature in Princeton was −16 °F (−27 °C) on January 
28, 1935, and the highest record temperature was 105 °F (41 °C) on July 
9, 1936.[75] Princeton University is a dominant feature of the community. 
Its main campus has its historic center on Nassau Street in the borough 
and stretches south into the township. Its James Forrestal satellite campus 
is located in Plainsboro Township, and some playing fields lie within adjacent 
West Windsor Township. Westminster Choir College, the renowned school of 
music presently owned by Rider University, established in Princeton in 
1932. Before establishing in Princeton, the school resided in Dayton, Ohio 
and then briefly in Ithaca, New York.[77] Princeton Theological Seminary, 
the first and oldest seminary in America of the Presbyterian Church (USA), 
has its main academic campus in Princeton, and residential housing is located 
just outside the Township in West Windsor Township. The Institute for Advanced 
Study is in the borough and maintains extensive land holdings (the "Institute 
Woods") there. Mercer County Community College in West Windsor is the nearest 
public college to serve Princeton residents. The Princeton Public Schools 
serve students in Kindergarten through twelfth grade. As of the 2011-12 
school year, the district's six schools had an enrollment of 3,347 students 
and 296.9 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio 
of 11.27:1.[78] Schools in the district (with 2011-12 enrollment data from 
the National Center for Education Statistics[79]) are four elementary schools 
— Community Park Elementary School[80] (grades K-5; 305 students), Johnson 
Park Elementary School[81] (PreK-5; 351), Littlebrook Elementary School[82] 
(PreK-5; 342) and Riverside Elementary School[83] (PreK-5; 255) — John 
Witherspoon Middle School[84] with 719 students in grades 6-8 and Princeton 
High School[85] with 1,375 students in grades 9-12.[86] The high school 
is located within the former borough; the other schools are within the 
former township boundaries. The high school also serves students from Cranbury 
Township as part of a sending/receiving relationship.[87] In the early 
1990s, redistricting occurred between the Community Park and Johnson Park 
School districts, as the population within both districts had increased 
due to residential development. Concerns were also raised about the largely 
white, wealthy student population attending Johnson Park (JP) and the more 
racially and economically diverse population at Community Park (CP). As 
a result of the redistricting, portions of the affluent Western Section 
neighborhood were redistricted to CP, and portions of the racially and 
economically diverse John Witherspoon neighborhood were redistricted to 
JP. The Princeton Charter School (grades K-8) operates under a charter 
granted by the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Education. 
The school is a public school that operates independently of the Princeton 
Regional Schools, and is funded on a per student basis by locally raised 
tax revenues.[88] New Jersey Monthly magazine ranked Princeton High School 
as the 59th-best high school in New Jersey in its 2012 rankings of the 
"Top Public High Schools" in New Jersey, after being ranked 44th in 2010.[89] 
The school was also ranked as the 10th best school in New Jersey by U.S. 
News & World Report. [90] Private schools located in Princeton include 
The Lewis School of Princeton, Princeton Day School, Princeton Friends 
School, Hun School of Princeton, YingHua International School, and Princeton 
International School of Mathematics and Science (PRISMS). St. Paul Catholic 
School, (Pre-School to 8th grade) founded in 1878, is the oldest and only 
coeducational Catholic school, joining Princeton Academy of the Sacred 
Heart (K-8, all male) and Stuart Country Day School of the Sacred Heart 
(co-ed for Pre-K, and all female K-12), which operate under the supervision 
of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Trenton.[91] Schools that are outside 
the town proper but have Princeton mailing addresses include the American 
Boychoir School in Plainsboro Township, Chapin School, Princeton Junior 
School in Lawrence Township, the Waldorf School of Princeton (New Jersey's 
only Waldorf school), Princeton Montessori School in Montgomery Township, 
Eden Institute in West Windsor Township, and Princeton Latin Academy in 
Hopewell. The Princeton Public Library's current facility on Witherspoon 
Street was opened in April 2004 as part of the ongoing downtown redevelopment 
project, and replaced a building dating from 1966. The library itself was 
founded in 1909.[92] The Princeton Community Japanese Language School teaches 
weekend Japanese classes for Japanese citizen children abroad to the standard 
of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), 
and it also has classes for people with Japanese as a second language. 
The main office of the school is in Princeton although the office used 
on Sundays is in Memorial Hall at Rider University in Lawrence Township 
in Mercer County.[93] Courses are taught at Memorial Hall at Rider University.[94] 
As of May 2010[update], the borough had a total of 126.95 miles (204.31 km) 
of roadways, of which 118.36 miles (190.48 km) were maintained by the municipality, 
3.93 miles (6.32 km) by Mercer County, and 8.66 miles (13.94 km) by the 
New Jersey Department of Transportation.[95] U.S. Route 206[96] and New 
Jersey Route 27[97] pass through Princeton, along with County Routes 583,[98] 
571 (commonly known as Washington Road)[99] and 533.[100] Other major roads 
that are accessible outside the municipality include U.S. Route 1 (in Lawrence, 
West Windsor & South Brunswick), Interstate 95 (the section north of Trenton) 
and Interstate 295 (both in Lawrence), and the New Jersey Turnpike (also 
designated as Interstate 95, in South Brunswick). The closest Turnpike 
exits are Exit 8A in Monroe Township, Exit 8 in East Windsor, and Exit 
7A in Robbinsville. A number of proposed highways around Princeton have 
been canceled. The Somerset Freeway (Interstate 95) was to pass just outside 
the municipality before ending in Hopewell (to the south) and Franklin 
(to the north). This project was canceled in 1980. Route 92 was supposed 
to remedy the lack of limited-access highways to the greater Princeton 
area. The road would have started at Route 1 near Ridge Road in South Brunswick 
and ended at Exit 8A of the Turnpike. However, that project was killed 
in 2006. The latest project to idle and that has caused severe traffic 
issues in the area is the unfinished replacement of the bridge over the 
D&R canal. The project was supposed to end in August 2016, but is now at 
a standstill.[101] Princeton is roughly equidistant from New York City 
and Philadelphia. Since the 19th century, it has been connected by rail 
to both of these cities by the Princeton Branch rail line to the nearby 
Princeton Junction Station on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.[102][103] The 
Princeton train station was moved from under Blair Hall to a more southerly 
location on University Place in 1918,[102] and was moved further southeast 
in 2013.[104] Commuting to New York from Princeton became commonplace after 
the Second World War.[105] While the Amtrak ride time is similar to New 
York and to Philadelphia, the commuter-train ride to New York — via NJ 
Transit's Northeast Corridor Line — is generally much faster than the equivalent 
train ride to Philadelphia, which involves a transfer to SEPTA trains in 
Trenton. New Jersey Transit provides shuttle service between the Princeton 
and Princeton Junction stations; the train is locally called the "Dinky",[103] 
and has also been known as the "PJ&B" (for "Princeton Junction and Back").[106] 
Two train cars, or sometimes just one, are used. NJ Transit provides bus 
service to Trenton on the 606 route and local service on routes 605 and 
655.[107] Coach USA Suburban Transit operates frequent daily service to 
midtown NYC on the 100 route, and weekday rush-hour service to downtown 
NYC on the 600 route.[108] Princeton and Princeton University provide the 
FreeB and Tiger Transit local bus services.[109] Princeton Airport is a 
public airport lying 3 miles (5 km) north of Downtown Princeton in Montgomery 
Township. The private Forrestal Airport was located on Princeton University 
property, 2 miles (3 km) east of the main campus, from the early 1950s 
through the early 1990s. The closest commercial airport is Trenton-Mercer 
Airport in Ewing Township, about 15 miles (24 km) from the center of Princeton, 
which is served by Frontier Airlines nonstop to and from 17 points nationwide. 
Other nearby major airports are Newark Liberty International Airport and 
Philadelphia International Airport, located 39 miles (63 km) and 52 miles 
(84 km) away, respectively. People who were born in, residents of, or otherwise 
closely associated with Princeton include: Note: this list does not include 
people whose only time in Princeton was as a student. Only selected faculty 
are shown, whose notability extends beyond their field into popular culture. 
See Faculty and Alumni lists above. Also: Princeton was the setting of 
the Academy Award-winning A Beautiful Mind about the schizophrenic mathematician 
John Nash. It was largely filmed in central New Jersey, including some 
Princeton locations. However, many scenes of "Princeton" were actually 
filmed at Fordham University's Rose Hill campus in the Bronx.[citation 
needed] The 1994 film I.Q., featuring Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins, and Walter 
Matthau as Albert Einstein, was also set in Princeton, and was filmed in 
the area. It includes some geographic stretches, including Matthau looking 
through a telescope from the roof of "Princeton Hospital" to see Ryan and 
Robbins' characters kissing on the Princeton Battlefield.[214] Historical 
films which used Princeton as a setting but were not filmed there include 
Wilson, a 1944 biographical film about Woodrow Wilson. In his 1989 independent 
feature film Stage Fright, independent filmmaker Brad Mays shot a drama 
class scene in the Princeton High School auditorium, using PHS students 
as extras. On October 18, 2013, Mays' feature documentary I Grew Up in 
Princeton had its premiere showing at Princeton High School. The film, 
described in one Princeton newspaper as a "deeply personal 'coming-of-age 
story' that yields perspective on the role of perception in a town that 
was split racially, economically and sociologically",[215] is a portrayal 
of life in the venerable university town during the tumultuous period of 
the late sixties through the early seventies. Scenes from the beginning 
of Across the Universe (film) (2007) were filmed on the Princeton University 
campus. Parts of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen were filmed in Princeton. 
Megan Fox and Shia LaBeouf were filming on Princeton University campus 
for two days during the summer of 2008. Scenes from the 2008 movie The 
Happening were filmed in Princeton. The 1938 Orson Welles radio broadcast 
of The War of the Worlds, is set partly in nearby Grover's Mill, and includes 
a fictional professor from Princeton University as a main character, but 
the action never moves directly into Princeton. The TV show House was set 
in Princeton, at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, 
and establishing shots for the hospital display the Frist Campus Center 
of Princeton University. The actual University Medical Center of Princeton 
at Plainsboro opened on May 22, 2012, exactly one day after the finale 
of House aired.[216] The 1980 television miniseries Oppenheimer is partly 
set in Princeton. F. Scott Fitzgerald's literary debut, This Side of Paradise, 
is a loosely autobiographical story of his years at Princeton University. 
Princeton University's Creative Writing program includes several nationally 
and internationally prominent writers, making the community a hub of contemporary 
literature. Many of Richard Ford's novels are set in Haddam, New Jersey, 
a fictionalized Princeton.[149] Joyce Carol Oates 2004 novel Take Me, Take 
Me With You (written pseudonymously as Lauren Kelly) is set in Princeton.[217] 
New Jersey author Judy Blume set her novel Superfudge in Princeton.[218]
