The 1976 Atlanta Braves season was the franchise's 106th consecutive year 
of existence in American professional baseball, its 101st in the National 
League, and its eleventh in its third home city, Atlanta. The Braves finished 
in sixth and last place in the National League West Division, compiling 
a 70–92 (.432) win-loss record; although the 70 victories represented a 
three-game improvement over the fifth-place 1975 edition, the last-place 
finish would be the first of four straight years in the NL West divisional 
basement. The club drew 818,179[1] fans to Atlanta Stadium, a 53 percent 
increase over its dismal 1975 attendance of less than 535,000 fans. On 
January 7, 1976, the modern era of the Braves franchise effectively began 
when Atlanta broadcast executive and world-class yachtsman Ted Turner bought 
100 percent of the team from the Atlanta LaSalle Corp. for $10 million. 
The previous ownership group, as the LaSalle Corp., had owned the team 
since October 1962 and spearheaded its move from Milwaukee to Atlanta in 
time for the 1966 season; its chairman, William Bartholomay, retained his 
association with the Turner-owned Braves as chairman of the board.[4] Early 
reports speculated that Turner bought the Braves to provide local programming 
content for his television station, then WTCG-TV, Channel 17. But Turner 
would become a highly successful baseball executive and turn WTCG into 
the WTBS Superstation and a cornerstone of the Turner Broadcasting System. 
Turner wasted no time in making headlines and major changes in the Braves' 
front office. On April 11, 1976, he signed one of baseball's first free 
agents, starting pitcher Andy Messersmith, who had successfully sued baseball 
and brought about the end of the reserve clause,[5] for a contract valued 
at more than $1 million. Messersmith, a 19-game-winner for the 1975 Dodgers, 
was initially issued a uniform bearing the numeral 17 but the word "Channel" 
instead of his nameplate above it, promoting Turner's WTCG outlet. He made 
the NL All-Star team that season, his most successful as a Brave, and was 
one of the few bright spots in a 92-loss, last-place season. The team's 
field manager, Dave Bristol, hired by the previous owners three months 
before the sale, survived the 1976 season—but he would be involved in a 
bizarre firing-and-rehiring by Turner during the 1977 campaign. Turner 
also employed three general managers in 1976. In May, he replaced veteran 
baseball man Eddie Robinson, inherited from the previous regime and in 
office for almost four full years, with former Boston Red Sox executive 
John Alevizos. But Alevizos lasted only four months before he was removed 
in favor of Braves' farm system director Bill Lucas, who became the first 
African-American general manager in Major League history on September 17. 
Lucas, the former brother-in-law of Braves' legend Henry Aaron, would begin 
the rebuilding of the franchise into a competitor, but he died suddenly 
at age 43 from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1979, the year before the Braves 
finally cracked the .500 mark. Led by stars such as Dale Murphy and Bob 
Horner, the early 1980s Braves featured a succession of successful teams, 
and won the 1982 National League West Division championship. But they declined 
precipitously in 1985, and after some very lean years in the late 1980s, 
Turner, working with a talented team of senior executives such as Bobby 
Cox, Stan Kasten and John Schuerholz, would turn the Braves into a perennial 
contender during the 1990s, and a nationally popular franchise on WTBS, 
where they styled themselves as "America's Team." They won consecutive 
division titles from 1991–1993 and 1995–1996, NL pennants in 1991, 1992, 
1995 and 1996, and the 1995 World Series, before Turner sold the team and 
all of his Turner Broadcasting holdings to Time Warner in 1996. Infielders
