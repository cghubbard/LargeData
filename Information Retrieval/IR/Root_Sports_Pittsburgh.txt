Root Sports Pittsburgh is an American regional sports network that is owned 
by the AT&T Sports Networks subsidiary of AT&T Inc., as an owned-and-operated 
outlet of Root Sports and is an affiliate of Fox Sports Networks. Headquartered 
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the channel broadcasts local coverage of sports 
events throughout the Greater Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania, as well 
as national programs from Fox Sports Networks including college sports, 
and magazine, entertainment and documentary programs. As of August 2013[update], 
Root Sports Pittsburgh is available on cable providers throughout nearly 
all of Pennsylvania (outside of the Philadelphia market), West Virginia, 
western Maryland, eastern Ohio, southwestern border areas of New York and 
Ashland, Kentucky, reaching more than 2.4 million homes; it is also available 
nationwide on satellite via DirecTV and Dish Network. The channel launched 
on April 13, 1986 as Pirates Cable Network, exclusively serving the Pittsburgh 
metropolitan area; its first sports event telecast on that date was a Major 
League Baseball game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago Cubs from 
Three Rivers Stadium, announced by Mike Lange, in which the Pirates shut 
out the Cubs, 8-0. The network commenced full-time broadcasts on April 
24, 1986, under the new name KBL Entertainment Network, in order to allow 
other sports besides the Pirates to be included on the network. Its first 
regular broadcast was a Pirates home game against the New York Mets.[1] 
The network was initially owned by Tele-Communications Inc. (now part of 
Comcast), then the largest cable television provider in the Pittsburgh 
market. KBL quickly expanded its cable coverage, expanding to what is approximately 
its present-day six-state broadcast area on May 9, 1986. While it primarily 
carried sports-related programming, KBL also served as a general entertainment 
cable channel while under TCI ownership, essentially filling the void left 
after independent station WPGH-TV (channel 53) became a charter affiliate 
of the Fox Broadcasting Company seven months after KBL's debut. It aired 
children's programming for part of the day, including reruns of the John 
Candy animated series Camp Candy.[1] In 1994, TCI transferred the channel 
to its corporate parent Liberty Media; KBL then immediately dropped all 
entertainment programming and converted the renamed Prime Sports KBL into 
an affiliate of Prime SportsChannel America, a partnership between Liberty's 
Prime Network and the Cablevision/NBC-owned SportsChannel America regional 
sports network groups. In 1995, Prime Network's retail subsidiary, Prime 
Sports Merchandising, purchased some sports apparel stores located inside 
shopping malls and rebranded them as Prime Sports Shops, promoting them 
on its networks including KBL.[2] In 1996, News Corporation, which formed 
a sports division for the Fox network two years earlier after it obtained 
the broadcast rights to the National Football Conference and sought to 
create a group of regional sports networks, acquired a 50% interest in 
the Prime Network from TCI parent Liberty Media.[3] Later that year on 
November 1, News Corporation and Liberty Media relaunched the Prime Network 
affiliates as part of the new Fox Sports Net group, with Prime Sports KBL 
officially rebranding as Fox Sports Pittsburgh.[4] The deal temporarily 
ended the Prime SportsChannel partnership, although News Corporation subsequently 
acquired most of the SportsChannel networks the following year;[5] the 
retail stores, meanwhile, retained the "Prime Sports" name for many years 
after the rebranding of the regional networks as part of Fox Sports Net. 
The channel was rebranded as Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh in 2000, as part 
of a collective brand modification of the FSN networks under the "Fox Sports 
Net" banner; subsequently in 2004, the channel shortened its name to FSN 
Pittsburgh, through the networks' de-emphasis of the "Fox Sports Net" brand. 
On December 22, 2006, News Corporation sold its interest in FSN Pittsburgh 
and sister networks FSN Utah, FSN Northwest and FSN Rocky Mountain to Liberty 
Media, in an asset trade in which News Corporation also traded its 38.5% 
ownership stake in satellite provider DirecTV for $550 million in cash 
and stock, in exchange for Liberty Media's 16.3% stake in the company.[6] 
On May 4, 2009, DirecTV Group Inc. announced it would become a part of 
Liberty's entertainment unit, part of which would then be spun off into 
the separate company under the DirecTV name, in a deal in which Liberty 
would increase its share in DirecTV from 48% to 54%, with Liberty owner 
John Malone and his family owning a 24% interest. DirecTV would operate 
its newly acquired FSN-affiliated networks through DirecTV Sports Networks,[7] 
a new division formed when the split off from Liberty Media was completed 
on November 19, 2009.[8] On December 17, 2010, DirecTV Sports Networks 
announced that its four Fox Sports Networks-affiliated regional outlets 
would be relaunched under the "Root Sports" brand.[9] The network officially 
rebranded as Root Sports Pittsburgh on April 1, 2011, coinciding with the 
start of the 2011 Major League Baseball season. For nominal purposes, the 
Root Sports networks continued to carry programming distributed mainly 
to the Fox Sports regional networks to provide supplementary sports and 
entertainment programming. On April 8, 2016, DirecTV Sports Networks rebranded 
under the AT&T name as AT&T Sports Networks.[10] Root Sports Pittsburgh 
carries more than 350 live sports events annually (all of which are also 
available in high definition), featuring a mix of professional, collegiate 
and high school sports. To fill out its schedule outside various local 
sports, the network also carries sports events, documentary and magazine 
programs distributed nationally by Fox Sports Networks through its programming 
affiliation with its former regional sports network group parent. The network 
holds the regional cable television rights to the Pittsburgh Pirates of 
Major League Baseball, carrying over 150 regular season and Spring training 
games annually, as well as rebroadcasts of recent games (as part of Pirates 
Instant Replay) and the team analysis program Inside Pirates Baseball. 
Since the beginning of the 2013 season, Root's telecasts of Pirates games 
are blacked out on DirecTV in many portions of the Pirates' claimed territory, 
including the Columbus, Ohio market. Despite the blackout, DirecTV does 
not allow Pirates games to be shown in the blacked-out area on its MLB 
Extra Innings package. Root Sports also maintains exclusive regional rights 
to most regular season and any early-round Stanley Cup Playoff games involving 
the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins; it also carries Penguins-related programs 
such as the game replay shows Penguins Rewind and Penguins Instant Replay, 
and the team magazine program Inside Penguins Hockey. On April 27, 2011, 
Root Sports Pittsburgh reached a 20-year contract extension with the Penguins, 
allowing the network to continue carrying most of the team's NHL game telecasts 
through the end of the 2028â€“29 NHL season.[11] The network also serves 
as the cable home of the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, broadcasting team-related 
magazine and analysis programs such as weekly press conferences held by 
coach Mike Tomlin during the regular season and the team coach's show The 
Mike Tomlin Show (both hosted by Stan Savran). Root Sports Pittsburgh carries 
a heavy amount of collegiate sporting events, including the exclusive rights 
to the Pittsburgh Panthers, carrying the team's men's basketball games 
and the football team's Tuesday press conferences; as well as football, 
and men's and women's basketball games involving California University 
of Pennsylvania and Northeast Conference. The network also carries men's 
and women's basketball games from the American Athletic Conference (via 
ESPN Plus) and Atlantic Coast Conference (via Raycom Sports); as well as 
football and men's basketball games from Pac-12 Conference (including the 
Pac-12 Men's Basketball Tournament); football and women's basketball games 
from the Big 12 Conference through Fox Sports Networks. It also carries 
college basketball games featuring the West Virginia Mountaineers, Robert 
Morris Colonials and Duquesne Dukes; the Tuesday press conference of the 
West Virginia Mountaineers football team; as well as the magazine programs 
of the Penn State Nittany Lions (Penn State Story), Notre Dame Fighting 
Irish (Inside Notre Dame Basketball and Inside Notre Dame Football) and 
Marshall Thundering Herd (Marshall Basketball Today and Marshall Football 
Today). High school sports events are also carried on Root Sports Pittsburgh 
including the McDonald's Game of the Week on Thursday and Friday nights 
during the high school football season, and the Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic 
Athletic League football championships. It also holds the television rights 
to Pennsylvania Interscholastic Hockey League's Penguins Cup tournament,
