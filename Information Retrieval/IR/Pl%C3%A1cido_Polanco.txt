Plácido Enrique Polanco (/ˈplɑːsᵻdoʊ ɛnˈriːkeɪ poʊˈlɑːŋkoʊ/; born October 
10, 1975) is a Dominican-American former professional baseball player. 
He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia 
Phillies, Detroit Tigers and Miami Marlins. He was a second baseman, third 
baseman and shortstop. He was twice voted to start in Major League Baseball 
All-Star Games: in 2007, and again in 2011. In a July 9, 2008, ceremony 
at Comerica Park prior to the Tigers–Indians game, Polanco received his 
U.S. citizenship, along with 99 other people. He wore his Tigers uniform 
for the ceremony.[1] Polanco was drafted on June 2, 1994, by the St. Louis 
Cardinals in the 19th round of the 1994 Major League Baseball Draft. In 
1996, he led the Florida State League with 157 hits and 137 games played 
while playing with Single-A St. Petersburg.[2] Polanco was promoted to 
the major leagues in 1998. His first major league hit was a single off 
Cincinnati Reds starting pitcher Brett Tomko on July 5, 1998. Earning the 
starting third base job in 2001, his low strikeout/walk ratio and extra 
base hits numbers established Polanco as a contact hitter.[3] On July 29, 
2002, Polanco, Mike Timlin, and Bud Smith were acquired by the Phillies 
for Scott Rolen, Doug Nickle, and cash. Polanco was shifted to second base 
as David Bell was signed from free agency to play third base. He began 
to develop power while playing for the Phillies as he hit 14 and 17 home 
runs in the following two years, compared with just nine in 2002. The Phillies 
traded him to the Detroit Tigers in a June 2005 in a trade for veteran 
right-hander Ugueth Urbina and infielder Ramón Martínez, allowing the Phillies 
to play Chase Utley every day at second base. Polanco finished the 2005 
season batting .338 with the Tigers, and also having a career year with 
regards to OPS, finishing the season at .847. In addition, he led the majors 
in lowest strikeout percentage (5.0%) for the season.[4] Polanco was a 
key player in the 2006 American League Division Series and 2006 American 
League Championship Series (ALCS) for the Tigers, being named Most Valuable 
Player of the ALCS. However, he did not record a single hit in the 2006 
World Series, in which the Tigers lost to the Cardinals in five games. 
In 2007, Polanco set a new major-league record for second basemen by playing 
in his 144th consecutive errorless game on August 13, in a 7–2 loss to 
the Oakland Athletics. Curt Flood currently holds the record for consecutive 
errorless games with 226, but he played center field. Polanco appeared 
to have his streak snapped at 147 games when he was charged with an error 
in the first inning of the August 24 game vs. the New York Yankees.[5] 
However, the next day, after conferring with the umpiring crew, the official 
scorer determined the error was instead charged to first baseman Marcus 
Thames.[6] This extended the streak to 149 games. Polanco also broke the 
record for consecutive chances without an error by a second baseman on 
July 31.[7] He passed Luis Castillo's mark of 647. Polanco finished the 
2007 season without making an error,[8] thereby becoming the first everyday 
second baseman in MLB history to play an entire season without committing 
an error. This in addition to contributing to 101 double plays, earned 
Polanco his first Gold Glove Award.[9] In addition to his fielding feats, 
Polanco batted a career-high .341 in 2007, and reached a career high in 
hits with 200. He also had the lowest strikeout percentage in the major 
leagues (5.1%).[10] For his efforts, he was given the Silver Slugger Award 
at second base. He was voted by the fans to start in the 2007 Major League 
Baseball All-Star Game, his first one. At the end of the season, he was 
voted by the fans as the 2007 MLB "This Year in Baseball Awards" Defensive 
Player of the Year. Polanco won another Gold Glove Award in 2009.[11] After 
declaring free agency, Polanco signed a three-year contract for $18 million 
to return to the Phillies, with a mutual option for a fourth year.[12] 
He was signed with the Phillies to replace Pedro Feliz at third base. In 
2011, Polanco was elected by fan balloting to be the starting third baseman 
in the All-Star game. He was unable to play in the All-Star game due to 
an injury, and Scott Rolen replaced him in the starting lineup. At the 
conclusion of the 2011 season, Polanco received his third Gold Glove, making 
him only the second baseball player in history to receive the award at 
more than one position (the other being Darin Erstad).[13] On May 14, 2012, 
Polanco reached the 2,000 hit mark with an eighth-inning home run off David 
Carpenter of the Houston Astros. On October 29, the Phillies elected to 
decline their half of a $5.5MM mutual option, instead electing to pay Polanco 
a $1MM buyout.[14] On December 20, 2012, the Miami Marlins and Polanco 
agreed to a one-year contract worth $2.75 million,[15] making him the second-highest 
paid player on the team.[16] The Marlins did not re-sign Polanco after 
the 2013 season and he was unable to find a contract in free agency for 
the 2014 season. In March 2015, he claimed to be "90 percent" retired but 
remained open to the possibility of returning to playing or launching a 
coaching career under the right circumstances.[17] On August 14, 2016, 
Polanco officially retired with the Phillies. [18] Polanco and wife Lily 
have a daughter, Aide Rose, and a son, Ishmael. He is a close friend of 
former teammate and current Angels first baseman Albert Pujols, who is 
godfather to Polanco's son Ishmael. During the 2008 season, while with 
the Detroit Tigers, he became a naturalized American citizen, taking the 
oath of citizenship at Comerica Park prior to a game against the Cleveland
