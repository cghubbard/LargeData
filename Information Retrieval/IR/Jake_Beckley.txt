Jacob Peter Beckley (August 4, 1867 – June 25, 1918), nicknamed "Eagle 
Eye", was a Major League Baseball player at the turn of the 20th century. 
He played for several major league teams between 1888 and 1907. He was 
inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1971. 
Beckley was born in Hannibal, Missouri.[2] He was the son of Bernhart and 
Rosina (Neth) Beckley. Beckley began playing semi-pro baseball while still 
a teenager. A former Hannibal teammate, Bob Hart, suggested the 18-year-old 
Beckley to the Leavenworth Oilers (Leavenworth, Kansas) of the Western 
Association.[3] After splitting two seasons between Leavenworth and a team 
in Lincoln, Nebraska, Jake Beckley's contract was sold to the St. Louis 
Whites in the Western Association before he was purchased (along with Harry 
Staley) by the Pittsburgh Alleghenys for $4,500 midway through the 1888 
season.[4] After playing one and a half seasons for the Alleghenys, Beckley 
and eight of his teammates jumped to the Pittsburgh Burghers,[4] a team 
in the newly formed Players' League (PL). Manager Ned Hanlon crossed over 
as well. Beckley stated he was willing to go to the PL because after all, 
"I'm only in this game for the money anyway."[3] The league lasted only 
one season, and Beckley spent the next five and a half seasons with the 
Pittsburgh Pirates.[4] His days in Pittsburgh finished, on July 25, 1896, 
Beckley was traded to the New York Giants for Harry Davis and $1,000.[4] 
Beckley was released by the Giants the following season on May 22, and 
he signed as a free agent with the Cincinnati Reds five days later.[4] 
In his first season with the Reds, Beckley was unsuccessful in getting 
rookie Honus Wagner out with the hidden ball trick, a tactic he had been 
known to use against the opposition. But later when Wagner's Louisville 
Colonels came to play at Cincinnati, Beckley was successful in getting 
Wagner out, employing a strategy that involved the use of two baseballs.[5] 
Against the St. Louis Cardinals, Beckley belted three home runs in the 
same game on September 26, 1897, a feat not again matched until 1922 by 
Ken Williams.[3] He played with Cincinnati for seven seasons and was later 
purchased by the St. Louis on February 11, 1904.[4] Beckley retired after 
the 1907 season with 2,930 career hits, second only to Cap Anson. He continues 
to rank fourth all-time among major leaguers in triples with 244. As of 
the 2014 season, Beckley holds the all-time best batting average amongst 
Pirates first basemen (.300).[6] Beckley married Molly Murphy of Hannibal 
in 1891.[3] She died of tuberculosis a few months after their wedding. 
He later remarried.[7] After his playing career ended, Beckley became a 
player/manager for Kansas City in the American Association in 1908–1909, 
Bartlesville in the Western Association in 1910, and Hannibal in the Central 
Association in 1911. He served as an umpire in the Federal League in 1913 
and also served as a baseball coach at William Jewell College in Liberty, 
Missouri. In addition to his umpiring and coaching after retirement from 
professional play, Beckley operated a grain business in Kansas City. He 
died of heart disease[8] in Kansas City, Missouri at the age of 50.[2]
