Terry Lee Steinbach (born March 2, 1962) is an American professional baseball 
catcher and coach. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 14 seasons, 
from 1986 through 1999, for the Oakland Athletics and Minnesota Twins. 
He has coached for the Twins since 2013. Steinbach was a three-time MLB 
All-Star with the Athletics' teams that reached the World Series in three 
consecutive years, winning the 1989 World Series. Steinbach attended New 
Ulm High School in New Ulm, Minnesota. The Cleveland Indians selected Steinbach 
in the 16th round of the 1980 Major League Baseball Draft, but Steinbach 
chose not to sign. He enrolled at the University of Minnesota, and played 
for the Minnesota Golden Gophers' college baseball team. With the Golden 
Gophers, Steinbach played as a third baseman.[1] In 1983, he was named 
the Big Ten Conference Co-Player of the Year, with Rich Stoll of the University 
of Michigan.[2] The Oakland Athletics selected Steinbach in the ninth round 
of the 1983 Major League Baseball Draft. Steinbach signed with the Athletics, 
and made his professional debut in the minor leagues. After two years as 
a third baseman, the Athletics moved Steinbach to catcher, and played him 
for two years in Class AA of the minor leagues.[3] Steinbach made his major 
league debut on September 12, 1986 against the Cleveland Indians when he 
hit a home run off of Greg Swindell in his first major league at-bat. He 
went on to be the starting catcher for Athletics' teams that won three 
straight American League pennants from 1988 to 1990, and the World Series 
in 1989. After leaving the Athletics following his career year in 1996, 
he played his last three years with the Minnesota Twins. He was elected 
to the American League All-Star team 3 times (1988, 1989 and 1993). His 
1988 selection was highly controversial because Steinbach had posted modest 
numbers in the first half of the season. However, during the game he accounted 
for both AL runs with a home run and sacrifice fly, and was named the game's 
MVP. Steinbach caught two no-hitters during his career (Dave Stewart in 
1990, Eric Milton in 1999). From 2008 to 2012, Steinbach was a coach for 
the Wayzata High School boys varsity baseball team in Plymouth, Minnesota. 
Steinbach's son Lucas played with the team during this time before graduating 
in June 2012.[4] He also worked as the Twins' minor league instructor for 
thirteen years.[3] On October 22, 2012, the Twins hired Steinbach to be 
the bench coach and catching instructor on manager Ron Gardenhire's coaching 
staff, succeeding Steve Liddle.[5][6] Stuart Turner, a catching prospect 
for the Twins, credited Steinbach's tutelage in spring training for his 
improvement as a catcher.[7] In 2014, Steinbach managed games in April 
and August, when Gardenhire was unable to attend the game.[8][9] Steinbach 
and his wife, Mary, have three adult children. Their two sons both play 
college baseball.[3][5] Terry's brother, Tom, was a teammate on the Golden
