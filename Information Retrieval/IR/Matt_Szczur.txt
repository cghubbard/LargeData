Matthew Francis Szczur (/ˈsizər/;[1][2] born July 20, 1989) is an American 
professional outfielder for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He played college football and baseball at Villanova University prior to 
signing a professional contract with the Cubs in January 2011.[3][4] Szczur 
was born in Cape May Court House, New Jersey, and grew up in the Erma section 
of Lower Township, New Jersey. He attended Lower Cape May Regional High 
School, where he earned varsity letters in football, baseball, and track 
and field. Szczur was drafted in the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft out 
of high school by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 38th round, but decided 
to attend Villanova University instead. Szczur played wide receiver, running 
back, wildcat QB and was a return specialist on special teams for the Villanova 
Wildcats football team. He gained 270 all-purpose yards and scored two 
touchdowns in a winning effort in the 2009 NCAA Division I FCS football 
season National Championship Game helping Villanova capture their first 
NCAA Football Championship. He was named MVP of that Championship Game. 
Also was a consensus All-American and 2009 CAA Offensive Player of the 
Year. Matt also played centerfield for the Villanova Baseball Program. 
Szczur signed a contract with the Chicago Cubs organization, which drafted 
him in the fifth-round of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft.[5] He received 
a $100,000 signing bonus, with an additional $500,000 if he declined to 
attend the NFL combine and made a written commitment to baseball before 
February 10, 2011. He was assigned to the club's short season Class-A team, 
the Boise Hawks, and first appeared in uniform July 8, 2010. He was then 
promoted to the club's mid-A team, the Peoria Chiefs on July 27, 2010. 
He hit .347 in 25 games in 2010. After the 2010 season, Szczur committed 
to baseball and signed a $1.5 million deal with the Cubs in January 2011.[6] 
As he was released from his initial contract and signed a new contract 
to receive the bonus, he would have been eligible in the 2011 Rule 5 draft 
if not added to the Cubs' 40 man roster.[7] On July 9, 2011, Szczur was 
assigned to the Class A-Advanced Daytona Cubs roster.[8] On July 27, 2012, 
Szczur was promoted to the Double-A Tennessee Smokies. [9] On August 16, 
2014, Szczur was called up to the Cubs. He made his debut with the Cubs 
the next day.[10][11] In 2015 Matt would spend time with the Iowa Cubs 
but would be recalled to Chicago on June 2. On April 29, 2016, Szczur hit 
his first Major League grand slam against the Atlanta Braves in the 8th 
inning, putting the Cubs up 6-1. In 2016, Szczur played 107 games batting 
.259 with five home runs and 24 RBI. The Cubs finished the season with 
a 103-58 record, and eventually ended their 108-year drought by winning 
the World Series over the Cleveland Indians. Although Szczur was not present 
during the playoffs, he would still win his first world championship.[12] 
In 2009, Szczur donated bone marrow to a 15-month-old Ukrainian girl named 
Anastasia battling Leukemia. Szczur essentially saved the girl's life given 
the severity of her condition and how hard it would have been to find another 
person that was a match for bone marrow. He met the healthy 4-year-old 
girl and her parents via Skype using a translator who was present at Anastasia's 
house. It was documented in E:60 Risking it All, which is one of ESPN's
