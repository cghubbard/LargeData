José Ariel Contreras Camejo (born December 6, 1971) is a Cuban professional 
baseball pitcher for the Tigres de Quintana Roo of the Mexican Baseball 
League. He has played in the Cuban National Series (CNS), Major League 
Baseball (MLB), and internationally for the Cuban national baseball team. 
Contreras played for Pinar del Río Vegueros of the CNS, and competed for 
the Cuban national team in the Summer Olympics, the Pan American Games, 
the Baseball World Cup, and the 1999 exhibition series against the Baltimore 
Orioles. Recognized as the best Cuban baseball player, Contreras defected 
from Cuba in 2002. Contreras signed with the New York Yankees of MLB after 
defecting, and played for them in 2003 and 2004. He has since played in 
MLB for the Chicago White Sox (2004–2009), Colorado Rockies (2009), and 
Philadelphia Phillies (2010–2012). In addition to his time with the Cuban 
national team, Contreras pitched for the Pinar del Río Vegueros of Cuba's 
Cuban National Series. In his last season in Cuba (2001–2002), he went 
13–4 with a 1.76 ERA and 149 strikeouts.[1] Contreras was named Cuban Athlete 
of the Year on three separate occasions.[citation needed] In March 1999, 
Contreras pitched for the Cuban national baseball team against the Baltimore 
Orioles in an exhibition series at Estadio Latinoamericano in Havana. Contreras 
pitched eight shutout innings and struck out ten.[2] It was then that Major 
League scouts took notice of the Cuban pitcher.[3] Contreras defected from 
Cuba in October 2002 while pitching for the Cuban national team during 
the Americas Series in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico,[4] leading the Yankees 
to sign him to a four-year deal on December 26, 2002.[5] Contreras went 
7–2 and posted a 3.30 ERA, but he spent two months on the disabled list 
with a subscapularis strain, had four stops in the minor leagues, and was 
in and out of the bullpen. While a starter, Contreras was 6–1 with a 2.34 
ERA. Out of the bullpen he was 1–1 with a 7.43 ERA. His best game occurred 
on September 23 at U.S. Cellular Field, in which he shut out the White 
Sox for eight innings while striking out nine. Contreras appeared in the 
8 postseason games, pitching 11 innings total, with a 5.73 ERA striking 
out 17. The Yankees inserted Contreras into the starting rotation from 
the start of the 2004 camp, but he was inconsistent. Contreras was optioned 
to the minor leagues for approximately a month (May 5 through May 21). 
His best start occurred on June 27, against the New York Mets. He struck 
out ten batters, but what was more important to him is that for the first 
time since being in Cuba, Contreras got to pitch in front of his ex-wife, 
Miriam and daughters, Naylan and Naylenis. On July 31, 2004 Contreras was 
traded to the White Sox for pitcher Esteban Loaiza.[6] Contreras pitched 
inconsistently for the White Sox, up until the end of the season. On the 
last day of the season, he threw eight innings of two hit baseball earning 
his 13th win of the season. He finished with a 5.50 ERA and 150 strikeouts 
in 170 1⁄3 innings between New York and Chicago. The 2005 season began 
with mixed results for Contreras. Contreras started the season with five 
consecutive no-decisions and an ERA of 3.04, and but pitched poorly after 
that until the All-Star break, with a 4–3 record. The first game after 
the break (July 14), Contreras pitched extremely well, beating the Indians 
1–0.[7] As the White Sox raced to the playoffs in the second half of the 
2005 season, Contreras became Chicago's most reliable pitcher, winning 
his last 8 starts and on occasion halting the team's losing streaks. One 
of the main reasons was the way he pitched. With the help of fellow Cuban 
Orlando Hernández, Contreras began dropping his arm angle during his delivery. 
Contreras also contributed the 3 postseason victories that tied Andy Pettitte 
for the most second half victories in the Major Leagues with 11, and he 
threw his first Major League complete game against the Minnesota Twins, 
on September 23[8] Contreras finished the season 15–7 with a 3.61 ERA and 
154 strikeouts in 204 2⁄3 innings. Contreras started Game 1 of every series 
during the playoffs. He won two of the three Game 1's. The one he lost 
was to the Los Angeles Angels, this allowed Contreras to earn the win in 
the pennant clinching Game 5, the fourth consecutive complete game for 
White Sox starting pitching. Contreras went 3–1, with a 3.09 ERA, 14 strikeouts, 
and only two walks. During Game 1 of the 2005 World Series, television 
commentators said that Contreras, who started the game for the White Sox, 
had his name banned from being mentioned in Cuba by order of President 
Fidel Castro.[citation needed] White Sox games were also banned from Cuban 
television and could be seen only with illegal television satellites.[citation 
needed] The White Sox went on to win the World Series in 4 games. The 2006 
season began with Contreras inking a three-year contract extension to remain 
on the South Side.[9] Contreras started the season as well as he had finished 
the previous one. As of July 6, 2006, he was 9–0, with a 3.31 ERA and 71 
strikeouts. On June 17, in an 8–6 win over the Cincinnati Reds, José pitched 
6 innings and threw a career high 13 strikeouts as he broke the White Sox 
team record with his 16th consecutive regular-season win, previously held 
by LaMarr Hoyt (1983–84) and Wilson Alvarez (1993–94). Dating back to the 
2005 season, Contreras won 17 consecutive games before finally taking the 
loss against his former team, the New York Yankees on July 14, 2006. Contreras 
was named by his White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén to the 2006 American League 
All-Star team, but was unable to play because he had thrown 6 innings and 
117 pitches in a start just two days before the All-Star game. Guillen, 
the AL manager, replaced him with Minnesota Twins rookie Francisco Liriano.[10] 
This enabled Contreras to become the first pitcher in 30 years to start 
2 consecutive regularly scheduled games. Contreras suffered setback as 
a case of sciatica put him on the 15-day DL in May. Along with seeing his 
personal winning streak come to an end, Contreras finished the season with 
a 4.27 ERA, including a 5.40 ERA after the All-Star break. Contreras struggled 
mightily in the 2007 campaign along with the disappointing White Sox team 
who finished fourth place in the American League Central Division. He posted 
a 10–17 record with a 5.57 ERA. One positive note for Contreras were the 
career-high 2 shutouts recorded on May 10 against the Minnesota Twins and 
on September 19 against the Kansas City Royals. Contreras ruptured his 
Achilles Tendon on August 9, 2008 while attempting to field a ground ball 
against the Boston Red Sox. The White Sox placed him on the 15-day disabled 
list, and Contreras ended up missing the rest of the season.[11] After 
an 0–5 start to the season, Contreras was sent to bullpen status on May 
9, 2009. On May 10, 2009 he was sent to the minors.[12] On May 12, 2009, 
Contreras cleared waivers and was optioned to Triple-A Charlotte Knights.[13] 
On June 8, 2009, Contreras was called up after the first game of a doubleheader 
against the Detroit Tigers to start the second game.[14] Coincidentally, 
Jeremy Bonderman was also called up after the first game to face Contreras. 
Contreras threw an outstanding eight innings and only gave up one hit and 
one walk, with three strikeouts, resulting in his first win.[15] In his 
second start after a brief stint in the minors Contreras was equally, if 
not more, dominant than his last appearance. Notching his second consecutive 
victory, Jose threw eight innings of shutout baseball once again, giving 
up two hits and two walks while striking out eight.[16] On August 31, 2009, 
Contreras was traded to the Colorado Rockies with cash for minor league 
pitcher Brandon Hynick.[17] On January 28, 2010, Contreras signed a 1-year, 
$1.5 million deal with the Philadelphia Phillies.[18] He pitched out of 
the bullpen rather than being a starter as he had for much of his career. 
He recorded his first career save against the Milwaukee Brewers after taking 
over the closer's role from the injured Brad Lidge. On October 29, 2012, 
the Phillies declined his 2013 option and he became a free agent. He went 
1-0 with a 5.27 ERA with 13.2 innings pitched in 17 games after spending 
most of the season on the disabled list.[19] On February 23, 2013, Contreras 
signed a minor league deal with an invite to spring training.[20] He was 
released on June 13, 2013. He was re-signed on June 17, 2013. The Pirates 
released Contreras on July 18, 2013. On July 19, 2013, the Boston Red Sox 
signed Contreras to a minor league contract. Contreras signed a minor league 
deal with the Texas Rangers on December 5, 2013.[21][22] The team granted 
the pitcher his release on March 22, 2014 when the club informed Contreras 
that he would not make the Opening Day roster.[23] On March 28, 2016, Contreras 
signed with the Tigres de Quintana Roo of the Mexican Baseball League.
