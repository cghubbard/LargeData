Henry Walter "Slick" Schlichter (1866-1944)[1] was an American sports executive, 
sportswriter, and boxing referee. He wrote for the Philadelphia Item, a 
daily newspaper. Along with National Baseball Hall of Famer Sol White and 
Philadelphia Tribune baseball writer Harry A. Smith, Schlichter co-founded 
the Philadelphia Giants Negro league baseball team.[2] He owned the Philadelphia 
Giants until he disbanded the team in 1911. He also co-founded an early 
all-black baseball league, the National Association of Colored Baseball 
Clubs of the United States and Cuba, and served as its president from 1906 
to 1909.[3] He also worked as a boxing referee from 1893 to 1910. Schlichter 
appears as the referee in Thomas Eakins's 1898 painting Taking the Count.
