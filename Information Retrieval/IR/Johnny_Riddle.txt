for the Chicago White Sox (1930), Washington Senators (1937), Boston Bees 
(1937–1938), Cincinnati Reds (1941, 1944–1945), and the Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1948). At the age of 42 in 1948 (as a player/coach), he was the oldest 
player to appear in a National League game that season. His younger brother 
was major league pitcher Elmer Riddle. Johnny Riddle was born in Clinton, 
South Carolina. His playing career was unusual in that not only did he 
once go seven years between major league appearances, it also took a span 
of nineteen years to appear in seven major league seasons. In those seven 
seasons, he got into only 98 games, an average of 14 per year. He made 
his major league debut on April 17, 1930 (Opening Day) against the Cleveland 
Indians at Comiskey Park. His last game was September 11, 1948 against 
the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. In his MLB career he was 51-for-214 
(.238) with 4 doubles, 1 triple, 11 runs batted in, and 18 runs scored. 
On defense he made only 5 errors and had a good fielding percentage of 
.983. He spent a 10 1⁄2 years as a coach in the National League, for the 
Pittsburgh Pirates (1948–1950), St. Louis Cardinals (1952–1955), Milwaukee 
Braves (1956–1957), Cincinnati Redlegs (1958), and Philadelphia Phillies 
(1959). He won a World Series championship with the Braves in 1957. Riddle
