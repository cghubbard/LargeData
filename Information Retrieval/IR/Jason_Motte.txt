Jason Louis Motte (born June 22, 1982) is an American professional baseball 
relief pitcher for the Colorado Rockies of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played in MLB for the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. 
The Cardinals drafted him as a catcher in 2003 and he converted to pitching 
in 2006. Motte played a key role in the 2011 World Series championship 
run, saving five postseason games. In 2012, he led the National League 
(NL) in saves with 42. Motte had surgery to repair an ulnar collateral 
ligament injury that kept him from playing all of 2013. After returning 
to the Cardinals midway through the 2014 season, Motte signed a one-year, 
$4.5 million deal with the Cubs for 2015. Motte was born in Port Huron, 
Michigan, but attended Valley Central High School, Montgomery, New York, 
in 2000 where he played catcher. Valley Central is also the alma matter 
of former MLB pitcher Matt Morris.[1] He then attended Iona College in 
New Rochelle, New York. At Iona, Motte could throw to second base from 
behind the plate as fast as 1.76 seconds, and was clocked at throwing 85 mph 
from this position. While Motte never pitched for Iona, the school's pitching 
coach reported that, with shinguards on, Motte once released a 94 mph pitch 
from the mound at practice.[2] Cardinals selected Motte in the 19th round 
of the 2003 Major League Baseball draft as a catcher. Early in his minor 
league career, he struggled as a hitter. He batted .222 in 2003, .175 in 
2004, and .176 in 2005. On June 29, 2005, Motte went on the disabled list 
(DL) for a thumb fracture while playing for the High-A Palm Beach Cardinals. 
Entering the 2006 season, Motte had compiled a .188 career batting average. 
He also had just 21 walks, 13 doubles and four home runs in 209 minor league 
games as a catcher. However, his arm strength and accuracy were difficult 
to ignore. Motte threw out 53 of 109 would-be base stealers for a 49% rate. 
He also recorded 160 assists in his first 181 games.[3] Spurred by the 
thumb injury, declining batting average and conspicuous throwing abilities, 
Motte converted to pitching.[4] The results as a pitcher showed much more 
promise than attempting to become a Major League hitter. Between State 
College and Quad Cities in 2006, Motte pitched his first 39 professional 
innings (IP). He struck out 38 (SO) and posted a 3.69 earned run average 
(ERA) while allowing 10.6 hits per nine innings pitched (H/9). The next 
season, he improved across the board. Between Palm Beach and Springfield, 
he totaled 59 IP, 69 SO, a 1.98 ERA and 6.6 H/9.[3] That performance made 
him one of the Cardinals' top pitching prospects and the Cardinals added 
him to their 40-man roster in early December 2007 to avoid exposing him 
to the Rule 5 draft.[4] Motte spent the majority of the 2008 season with 
the Memphis Redbirds, the St. Louis Cardinals' Triple-A farm team in the 
Pacific Coast League. His abilities as strikeout pitcher became even more 
prominent: in 66 2⁄3 IP, he struck out 110, a rate of 14.8 strikeouts per 
nine innings pitched.[3] The Cardinals called Motte from the minor leagues 
on September 2, 2008. He recorded a total of 12 appearances, all in relief, 
with an ERA of 0.82 in his first month in the big leagues. In 11 IP, Motte 
struck out 16 batters, allowing three walks and five hits. He earned his 
first save on September 18 against Cincinnati in their ballpark, getting 
the final out in the ninth inning with a fly ball to left field.[5] During 
the 2009 spring training camp, Motte competed with Ryan Franklin and Chris 
Perez in an attempt to earn the role as the Cardinals' 2009 closer; manager 
Tony La Russa later said he would not establish a closer. Instead, he would 
use a mix of relievers in the ninth inning. Motte was called on to save 
the first game. However, he gave up four runs to the Pittsburgh Pirates 
in the ninth inning. Pittsburgh won 6–4. After this blown save opportunity, 
La Russa moved Motte into a middle reliever role. Despite the blown the 
save on opening day and occasional rough outings that contributed to a 
4.59 ERA, Motte recorded 14 holds. Motte became the Cardinals' de facto 
closer late in the 2011 season – La Russa still had not named him as the 
closer – helping his team win the Wild Card. Motte pitched in two games 
against the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2011 National League Division 
Series (NLDS), in which the Cardinals won the series 3 games to 2. Motte 
also pitched in three games in the 2011 National League Championship Series 
(NLCS) against St. Louis' division rival, the MIlwaukee Brewers. The Cardinals 
won this series in six games. Motte was on the mound for the final out 
of the NLCS winning the Cardinals their 18th pennant. He was also on the 
mound when the Cardinals defeated the Texas Rangers in the World Series. 
He won the NL Player of the Week Award for the first time for his week 
of September 17–23, after picking up his fifth consecutive save out of 
five opportunities and league-leading 40th.[6] Motte finished the season 
with a National League leading 42 saves, one of only four pitchers in Cardinals 
history to reach the 40 or more saves.[7] On January 22, 2013, the St. 
Louis Cardinals announced they had reached a two-year contract with Motte, 
the financial details of which were not disclosed.[7] The deal effectively 
bought out the final two years of Motte's arbitration eligibility. At the 
end of the contract he will be a free agent.[7] Motte earned $1.95 million 
in 2012 and had filed for a salary of $5.5 million for 2013. The Cardinals 
counter-offer was reported as $4.5 million.[7] On March 29, 2013, the Cardinals 
placed Motte on the DL with a strained elbow. He and the team physician 
at first hoped that non-surgical rehab treatment could allow him to still 
pitch at some point in 2013. However, seeing little –if any – improvement, 
the Cardinals announced on May 3 Motte would undergo season-ending Tommy 
John surgery to repair a torn ligament in his elbow.[8] Manager Mike Matheny 
called upon Edward Mujica to replace Motte as closer. Eventually, rookie 
Trevor Rosenthal replaced Mujica by season's end and saved four games in 
the Cardinals' NL pennant-winning playoffs.[9] Like Adam Wainwright and 
Chris Carpenter before him – both of whom also rehabilitated through Tommy 
John surgery – Motte made himself available for the Cardinals relievers 
during games, especially for the rookies and inexperienced relievers. After 
the World Series, with Motte still recovering and Rosenthal's convincing 
finish as closer, Matheny announced Rosenthal would be the closer for 2014. 
Meanwhile, Motte continued to progress and was throwing off a mound by 
November. Due to Motte availing himself to the other Cardinals pitchers 
even while he was unable to pitch, his teammates voted for him to receive 
the Darryl Kile Good Guy Award. He is the first player to receive the award 
while not making a single game appearance in the season for which he was 
awarded.[10] On May 21, Motte made his long awaited return to the mound 
after missing 2013 due to Tommy John surgery, pitching 1 and 1/3 inning 
of scoreless relief. However, he struggled for the rest of the season and 
was ultimately left off the Cardinals' postseason roster. He became a free 
agent after they were eliminated by the San Francisco Giants. On December 
16, Motte and the Chicago Cubs agreed to a 1-year, $4.5 million contract.[11] 
On December 8, 2015, Motte signed a two-year, $10 million contract with 
the Colorado Rockies.[12] Motte's primary pitch is a four-seam fastball, 
which was clocked in the upper 90s during 2008. In 2012, it was clocked 
at 98 miles per hour (MPH). He also threw a cut fastball that reached 93 
MPH and a sinking fastball that reached 96 MPH, and, rarely, an 85-MPH 
changeup.[13] His cutter has shown among the widest variance of movement 
of all his pitches, to being anywhere from flat vertically to moving up 
to eight inches. He also regularly threw a curveball through the 2010 season, 
but has discontinued it since last throwing it in 2011.[14] Motte is married 
to Caitlin Motte. The couple run two foundations, the Jason Motte Foundation, 
and a cancer awareness foundation called "Strikeout Childhood Cancer." 
While recovering from Tommy John surgery in 2013, Motte disclosed that 
his encounters with numerous people stricken with cancer – from his grandfather 
to Cardinals fans, including many children – moved him to visit and encourage 
them. As a result, Motte and the Cardinals organized a pediatric cancer 
awareness day on September 23, 2013, to set aside 5,000 game tickets at 
the pavilion that cost $10.00 each, with $3.00 per ticket going to the 
Jason Motte Foundation. An additional 1,000 tickets were donated to pediatric 
cancer patients just released from the hospital. For those unable to go 
to Busch Stadium, Motte organized a group of several of his teammates to
