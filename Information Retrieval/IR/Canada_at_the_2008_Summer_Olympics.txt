Canada, which is represented by the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC), competed 
at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, People's Republic of China, from 
August 8 to 24, 2008. Canadian athletes have competed in every Summer Olympic 
Games since 1900, except the 1980 Summer Olympics which they boycotted. 
Canada sent 332 athletes in 25 sports, the seventh largest team at the 
games and Canada's largest since 1988.[2] Canada did not send a team in 
handball, volleyball or basketball.[3] Kayaker and 2004 Summer Olympics 
gold medalist Adam van Koeverden was the flag bearer at the opening ceremonies; 
Karen Cockburn bore the flag at the closing.[1][4] The COC had set a goal 
of finishing in the top 16 in total medals;[5] at the 2004 Summer Olympics, 
Canada finished 19th. Despite failing to win a single medal in the first 
week of the Games, Canada would rebound, winning a combined 18 medals in 
the next 9 days. This 9-day medal haul exceeded the 12 medals Canada won 
in Athens four years earlier. The country would wind up finishing 19th 
in gold medals and 14th in total medals in Beijing.[6] Equestrian show 
jumper Ian Millar competed at his ninth Summer Olympics, tying the record 
set by Hubert Raudaschl. He has been named to ten straight Olympic teams,

medalists earned $20,000; silver medalists were paid $15,000; and bronze 
medalists $10,000. A total of $515,000 from the Athlete Excellence Fund 
was given to the medal winning athletes.[8] Canada was the next host country

February training session.[12] Dylan Armstrong established a new Canadian 
record in the shot put. * The athlete who finished in second place, Lyudmila 
Blonska of the Ukraine, tested positive for a banned substance.[13] Both 
the A and the B tests were positive, therefore Blonska was stripped of 
her silver medal, and Zelinka moved up a position. Canada was represented 
by two singles players and a mixed doubles team. Men's team Canada qualified
