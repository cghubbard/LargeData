William Scott Middlebrooks (born September 9, 1988) is an American professional 
baseball third baseman in the Texas Rangers organization. He made his Major 
League Baseball (MLB) debut with the Boston Red Sox on May 2, 2012 and 
played with them through 2014. He also played for the San Diego Padres 
and Milwaukee Brewers. A fifth round draft pick in the 2007 MLB draft out 
of Liberty-Eylau High School in Texarkana, Texas, Middlebrooks signed with 
the Red Sox for $925,000, bypassing his commitment to Texas A&M University. 
Middlebrooks was originally a shortstop, but the Red Sox converted him 
into a third baseman in the minor leagues. He represented the United States 
in the 2011 All-Star Futures Game. Following Middlebrooks' emergence as 
the Red Sox' starting third baseman in 2012, the organization traded former 
All-Star Kevin Youkilis. After struggles in the 2013 and 2014 seasons, 
the Red Sox traded Middlebrooks to the San Diego Padres. Middlebrooks attended 
Liberty-Eylau High School in Texarkana, Texas.[1] Middlebrooks played shortstop 
and pitched for the high school baseball team. As a pitcher, he could reach 
90 miles per hour (140 km/h) with his fastball.[2] Liberty-Eylau won the 
Class 3A state championship in 2006, Middlebrooks' junior season.[3][4] 
In his senior season, Middlebrooks had a .555 batting average with 22 stolen 
bases and 48 runs batted in (RBIs) in 38 games, and a 13-0 win–loss record 
as a pitcher.[5][6] He was named to the Class 3A All-State First Team and 
Class 3A Player of the Year by the Texas Sports Writers Association.[7] 
In addition to baseball, Middlebrooks played American football and basketball 
in high school.[8] A quarterback, placekicker and punter, he played on 
the school's football team, which also featured LaMichael James.[9][10] 
He was named an All-State punter.[9] Middlebrooks admits that he preferred 
football, until he realized during his junior year that he had the opportunity 
to be selected in the Major League Baseball draft.[8][11] In November 2006, 
he committed to attend Texas A&M University on a full scholarship to play 
baseball and football for the Texas A&M Aggies.[5][8][12] Middlebrooks 
had been projected as a first round talent in the 2007 Major League Baseball 
draft.[13] However, the belief that he would follow through with his scholarship 
to Texas A&M led Middlebrooks to fall in the draft.[5] The Boston Red Sox 
drafted Middlebrooks in the fifth round of the draft, selecting him as 
a shortstop, rather than as a pitcher.[14][15] He received a $925,000 signing 
bonus to bypass his commitment to Texas A&M.[11] Middlebrooks made his 
professional debut in 2008 with the Lowell Spinners of the Class A-Short 
Season New York–Penn League, where he batted .254 with one home run. He 
described himself as developmentally behind other players at his level 
because of the time he had devoted to football.[8] Initially a shortstop, 
Middlebrooks made the transition to third base as he added muscle, increasing 
from 190 pounds (86 kg) at the time he was drafted to 210 pounds (95 kg).[8] 
In 2009, Middlebrooks played for the Greenville Drive of the Class A South 
Atlantic League, where he batted .265 with seven home runs and 57 RBIs.[16] 
He was promoted to the Salem Red Sox of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League 
in 2010 and responded by batting .276 with 12 home runs and 70 RBIs.[16] 
Middlebrooks began the 2011 season playing for the Portland Sea Dogs of 
the Class AA Eastern League. He played in the Eastern League All-Star Game, 
hitting a double in the game.[17] Middlebrooks also participated in the 
2011 All-Star Futures Game,[18] starting at third base and going 1-for-2.[19] 
Through August 2011, Middlebrooks batted .306 with 18 home runs and 80 
RBIs for Portland, at which point he was promoted to the Pawtucket Red 
Sox of the Class AAA International League. Joe McDonald of ESPN.com called 
Middlebrooks "Boston's likely [third baseman] of the future" upon his promotion 
from Portland to Pawtucket.[20] He hit .161 in 16 games with Pawtucket 
to close out the 2011 season.[8] After the 2011 season, the Red Sox assigned 
Middlebrooks to the Arizona Fall League, where he hit four home runs in 
13 games and was named to the Rising Stars Game.[9][18] In November 2011, 
Middlebrooks, Che-Hsuan Lin and Drake Britton were added to the Red Sox 
40-man roster to prevent them from being selected in the Rule 5 draft.[21] 
Heading into the 2012 season, Baseball America rated Middlebrooks as the 
Red Sox' best prospect and 51st best prospect overall.[22] Starting the 
2012 season with Pawtucket, Middlebrooks hit .333 with nine home runs and 
27 RBIs in 24 games and 93 at-bats.[23] Meanwhile, Red Sox starting third 
baseman Kevin Youkilis struggled, opening the 2012 season batting .219.[23] 
As Youkilis struggled, Middlebrooks appeared to be ready for a promotion.[24] 
The Red Sox promoted Middlebrooks to the major leagues on May 2, 2012, 
when Youkilis was placed on the disabled list.[23] He made his MLB debut 
that day, drawing a walk in his first plate appearance and recording two 
hits.[25] On May 6, he hit a game-tying grand slam for his first major 
league home run in what was eventually a 17-inning loss to the Baltimore 
Orioles.[26] In his first 41 games with the Red Sox, Middlebrooks batted 
.326 with nine home runs and 34 RBIs, the most RBIs to start a career for 
a member of the Red Sox since Walt Dropo recorded 37 RBIs in his first 
41 career games dating back to 1949–50.[27] Bobby Valentine, the manager 
of the Red Sox, initially alternated between Middlebrooks and Youkilis 
at third base. However, Middlebrooks' emergence led the Red Sox to trade 
Youkilis on June 23.[27][28] Middlebrooks was named American League Player 
of the Week for the week ending June 24.[29][30] Middlebrooks broke a bone 
in his right hand when he was hit by a pitch in a game against the Cleveland 
Indians on August 10, ending his rookie season with a .288 batting average, 
15 home runs and 54 RBIs in 75 games played.[31][32] On April 7, 2013, 
Middlebrooks hit three home runs in a 13–0 Red Sox victory over the Toronto 
Blue Jays in Toronto. Two of his home runs were hit off of pitcher R.A. 
Dickey.[33] However, he lost playing time to José Iglesias after he strained 
his back in May. After he batted .192 on the season, the Red Sox optioned 
Middlebrooks to Pawtucket on June 25, 2013.[34] The Red Sox opted not to 
promote Middlebrooks when they traded Iglesias on July 30, using Brandon 
Snyder and Brock Holt instead. After Middlebrooks made adjustments, the 
Red Sox recalled him from Pawtucket on August 10.[35][36] In Game 3 of 
the 2013 World Series, Middlebrooks was ruled to have obstructed future 
teammate Allen Craig after diving for an errant throw at third base. The 
play awarded Craig the game winning run for the Cardinals.[37] The Red 
Sox won the series over the Cardinals. In 2014, Middlebrooks missed 19 
games in April due to a strained calf. In May, he broke a finger, and again 
went on the disabled list.[38] He had been struggling at the plate to begin 
the season hitting just .197 with two home runs in 21 games.[39] As he 
rehabilitated his injury in the minor leagues, Middlebrooks began playing 
in the outfield, due to the Red Sox' signing of Stephen Drew.[40] After 
the Red Sox traded Drew, they hoped that Middlebrooks would improve his 
performance with more regular playing time. Middlebrooks continued to miss 
time later in the season due to lingering effects of the hand injury.[41] 
He finished the 2014 season with a .191 average in 215 at-bats.[42] During 
the 2014–15 offseason, the Red Sox signed free agent Pablo Sandoval, a 
third baseman. On December 19, 2014, the Red Sox traded Middlebrooks to 
the San Diego Padres for Ryan Hanigan, whom the Padres had acquired earlier 
the same day.[43] Middlebrooks competed with Yangervis Solarte to be the 
Padres' starting third baseman in spring training.[44] By July, the Padres 
began to use Middlebrooks at shortstop as Solarte received more playing 
time at third base.[15] With Middlebrooks batting .212 on the season, the 
Padres optioned Middlebrooks to the El Paso Chihuahuas of the Class AAA 
Pacific Coast League (PCL) on July 22.[45] On December 2, 2015, the Padres 
non-tendered Middlebrooks, making him a free agent.[46] On December 15, 
2015, Middlebrooks agreed to a minor league contract with an invitation 
to spring training with the Milwaukee Brewers.[47] The Brewers assigned 
him to the Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the PCL to start the 2016 season.[48] 
Middlebrooks batted .282 with 10 home runs and 47 RBIs for Colorado Springs, 
before he was promoted to the major leagues on July 4.[49] After batting 
.111 in ten games for Milwaukee, he went on the disabled list with a strained 
leg.[50] The Brewers activated him from the disabled list and outrighted 
him off of the 40-man roster on August 30. Middlebrooks signed a minor 
league contract with the Texas Rangers on November 11, 2016.[51] Middlebrooks 
is an athletic defensive player. He hits for power[52] and is also credited 
for his contact skills,[16] though he is not considered the most patient 
hitter. His throwing arm is well regarded,[52] and his baserunning is rated 
as average.[53] Middlebrooks grew up in Texarkana, Texas. His father, Tom, 
serves as the head baseball coach and assistant football coach at Liberty-Eylau, 
and his younger sister, Lacey, played softball for the University of Tulsa. 
She is now an assistant softball coach at Columbus State University in 
Columbus, Georgia. Middlebrooks' mother, Julie, and youngest sister, Mary, 
are artists; Julie is an art teacher.[54] He has been friends with Ryan 
Mallett of the Baltimore Ravens since they met in a football camp after 
Mallett moved to the Texarkana area in the seventh grade.[9][55] Middlebrooks 
was engaged to Ann Lux, a former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader, however they 
broke up in August 2012.[11][56] They are from the same hometown and have 
known each other since age 12.[57] Later in 2012, Middlebrooks began dating 
Jenny Dell, a reporter who covered the Red Sox for the New England Sports 
Network. They became engaged in July 2014,[58] and were married in February
