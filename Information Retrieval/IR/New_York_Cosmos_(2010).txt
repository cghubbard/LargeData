The New York Cosmos are an American professional soccer club based in Hempstead, 
New York that has played in the North American Soccer League, the second 
division of North American soccer, since 2013. The present formation of 
the team and organization, established since August 2010, is a rebirth[6][7][8] 
of the original New York Cosmos (1970–1985) that played in the previous 
North American Soccer League (1968–1984). The Cosmos' ownership group is 
headed by chairman Seamus O'Brien. Key executives include Chief Operating 
Officer Erik Stover, Vice Chairman Jeremy Wilkins and the team head coach 
Giovanni Savarese. A number of former stars are still involved with the 
team: Pelé as honorary president, with Shep Messing and Carlos Alberto 
as international ambassadors. The team won the Soccer Bowl in 2013, 2015 
and 2016 and the North American Supporters' Trophy in 2015 and 2016. The 
original New York Cosmos club was founded on December 10, 1970, and was 
named on February 4, 1971. The original North American Soccer League ceased 
operations after the 1984 season and the Cosmos were dissolved in 1985 
after playing a season in the Major Indoor Soccer League.[9] Peppe Pinton, 
managing director for the Cosmos at the time, continued to run and operate 
youth camps started in 1977 and named after the club's stars.[10][11][12] 
With the rise of Major League Soccer (MLS) during the late 1990s and 2000s, 
various New York City area entities approached Pinton about using the name 
for an MLS franchise. The existing franchise in New York, the MetroStars, 
made relevant inquiries both before and after becoming the New York Red 
Bulls in 2006.[13] Pinton was reluctant to let the name be used by an MLS 
team, believing that the league was unwilling to respect the Cosmos' heritage;[14] 
however, after seeing MLS reintroduce historical NASL names, he changed 
his mind. In late August 2009, Pinton sold the name and image rights to 
Paul Kemsley, the former vice-chairman of English Premier League club Tottenham 
Hotspur,[13][15][16] who headed a group intent on establishing a new Cosmos 
team in MLS. As the group's honorary president, Pelé announced the club's 
return on August 1, 2010.[17] Kemsley's group included English soccer businessman 
Terry Byrne as vice-chairman, as well as former Liverpool CEO Rick Parry.[3][18] 
Former Manchester United forward Eric Cantona was added as director of 
soccer in mid-January 2011,[19] with former United States player Cobi Jones 
as associate director. The original Cosmos' top goalscorer, Giorgio Chinaglia, 
was also named an international ambassador before his death in 2012.[3] 
The new Cosmos' first match was on August 5, 2011, when they played against 
Manchester United at Old Trafford in Paul Scholes's testimonial match. 
Cantona managed the team, mixing members of the Cosmos' under-23 team with 
guest players from around the world.[20][21][22] On October 26, 2011, Kemsley 
was bought out by Sela Sports, a Saudi Arabian company.[23][24] The departure 
of Kemsley as chairman and CEO was announced by the Cosmos with an official 
club statement saying that he wished "to pursue other interests and commitments". 
His replacement was not immediately announced.[25] A further press release 
on November 2 gave news of the company buyout, restructuring and various 
unspecified management changes within the organization. The statement also 
said that the goal of the club remained the same under its new owners – 
"unequivocally" to become an MLS team.[26] The Cosmos announced on July 
12, 2012, that they would start competitive play in the second-tier North 
American Soccer League in 2013, but insisted in the same press release 
that the club was still bent on ultimately joining MLS.[4][27] Giovanni 
Savarese, who had coached in the club's youth system, was confirmed as 
the senior team's first head coach on November 19 the same year.[5] About 
a month later, on December 11, former Red Bulls defender Carlos Mendes, 
a native of Long Island, became the new Cosmos' first senior player.[28] 
The Cosmos found immediate success in the NASL, winning the Fall Season 
Championship with a 9–4–1 (Win-Draw-Loss) record.[29] On November 9, 2013, 
the team emerged as the winner of Soccer Bowl 2013, winning 1–0 against 
the spring season champions, the Atlanta Silverbacks.[30] In June 2015 
the New York Cosmos was the first professional US team facing a Cuban National 
Team since 1978.[citation needed] In July 2012, when the Cosmos' entry 
to the second-tier North American Soccer League was confirmed, starting 
in 2013, The New York Times reported that the club would initially play 
home games at James M. Shuart Stadium, on the campus of Hofstra University 
in Hempstead, New York, about 20 miles (32 km) east of downtown New York 
City on Long Island. The stadium seats 11,929,[31] and was home to the 
original Cosmos club during the 1972 and 1973 seasons.[2] The Cosmos have 
proposed to construct a new 25,000-seat stadium at a parking lot next to 
the Belmont Park racetrack in Elmont, at the border between Queens and 
Nassau County. Plans for the $400 million project were submitted to the 
Empire State Development Corporation as a response to a request for proposal. 
A decision is pending.[32] Occasionally the Cosmos will play matches at 
MCU Park in Brooklyn.[33] There are currently three supporters groups that 
all share the "Five Points" supporters section at Hofstra Stadium.[34] 
The New York City based supporters group is the Borough Boys Supporters 
Club, a group originally formed in 2007 to lobby for the creation of a 
professional soccer team based in New York City. The members first met 
in October 2007 and decided on the name "Borough Boys" on November 17, 
2007, after holding a vote. The club's original motivation was simply the 
desire for professional soccer in the city, and to that end it held talks 
with city officials in early 2008. Soon after Kemsley's group bought the 
Cosmos rights in late 2009, the club wrote an open letter asking him to 
create an MLS franchise within the city; he reacted positively, leading 
the Borough Boys to pledge their support. The Borough Boys have since maintained 
a close relationship with the Cosmos.[35][36] The supporters club is made 
up of around 1,000 members, and represents a broad spectrum of fans from 
many different backgrounds.[37] The Borough Boys' original logo used the 
colors of New York City—white, blue and orange—and was based around the 
arches of the Brooklyn Bridge; it also used the motto of Brooklyn, Eendracht 
Maakt Macht, which translates from Dutch as "Unity makes strength".[37] 
After the club became affiliated with the Cosmos, it adopted a new emblem 
featuring a navy blue skull, seen in profile facing to the left, surrounded 
by green, yellow and blue "blades" similar to those on the Cosmos badge.[36][37] 
La Banda del Cosmos (a Latin American Barra Brava)[38] and The Cross Island 
Crew which is based on Long Island are two other supporters groups for 
the Cosmos. The Cross Island Crew was originally founded as Sagan's Army 
but decided to re-branded themselves in late 2013. The name comes from 
the region that they represent. The Cross Island Crew logo is a green ring 
with yellow edging, with the name is in white lettering in the green ring, 
and the center having the top of a lighthouse with in it. For the 2013 
season, all Cosmos games were broadcast live on ONE World Sports and live 
or tape-delayed on SNY. The majority of the games featured the on-air team 
of play-by-play announcer JP Dellacamera and Janusz Michallik as the color 
analyst. ONE World Sports also produced Cosmos Classics, an original series 
featuring historic Cosmos matches from the 1970s and 1980s.[39] The 2014 
broadcasting rights were given to ONE World Sports; in 2015 the network 
also gained the right to access both home and away matches.[citation needed] 
As of the 2016 NASL fall season, NBC Deportes has the Spanish-language 
broadcasting rights to all Cosmos home and away games. Where a player has 
not declared an international allegiance, nation is determined by place 
of birth. [40] Last updated: April 29, 2016. Bolded players are currently 
on the New York Cosmos roster. Last Updated: August 6, 2015. Bolded players 
are currently on the New York Cosmos roster. The Cosmos are owned by Sela 
Sport, a marketing company based in Saudi Arabia.[45] Ownership partners 
include International Sports Events and World Sport Group.[46] The club 
operated the Cosmos Academy, which it formed on foundation in August 2010. 
The academy was affiliated with Blau Weiss Gottschee and based in Queens, 
New York. It competed at various levels of the U.S. Soccer Development 
Academy, fielding teams in the under-9 to under-18 age groups.[47] The 
US under-17 team's Spring 2011 roster included three players from the Cosmos 
Academy, more than any MLS team.[48][49] A western division called Cosmos 
Academy West existed between August 2010 and August 2011, based in Pomona, 
California, about 27 miles (43 km) east of Los Angeles.[nb 2] At the end 
of 2010, it was ranked by Soccer America as the third best boys' club in 
the United States and the top boys' club in California.[51][52] Six months 
after its original partnership with Los Angeles Futbol Club was terminated 
in February 2011,[50][51][53] Cosmos Academy West disbanded in August 2011, 
its operations folded into those of MLS club Chivas USA.[54] This was done 
so that the Cosmos would fit more closely the requirements of a potential 
MLS team based out of New York City.[55] As part of the deal made with 
the Cosmos in 2010, Blau Weiss Gottschee were to receive payment from New 
York in January and August each year. After the first two bi-annual payments 
were made on-time, an unspecified amount was still outstanding from the 
third three months after its due date on August 1, 2011, causing Blau Weiss 
Gottschee to file suit for non-payment against the Cosmos on November 8, 
2011. Because of the lack of funding, Blau Weiss was forced to restore 
the tuition, transport and training fees which players had been required 
to pay before the 2010 deal, but which had been thereafter covered by the 
Cosmos sponsorship. The Blau Weiss statement did not reveal the court in 
which the claim will be filed.[56] An under-23 Cosmos side was accepted 
into the USL Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the United 
States soccer pyramid, in May 2011, and was expected to join for the 2012 
season. In preparation for this it played exhibition matches against existing 
PDL clubs during 2011, coached by Savarese.[57] However, it did not take 
part in the 2012 PDL season.[58] In fall of 2014, the Cosmos announced 
that recently signed Raúl González Blanco would, in addition to playing 
for the senior side, take an advisory role with the club's upcoming and 
rebooted academy. Announcements regarding the academy's structure are expected 
in early 2015 but it has been hinted that Raul, Marcos Senna, and Giovanni 
Savarese (the architect of Red Bull New York's wildly successful academy) 
would all be taking leadership roles in the player development program.[59] 
At the time of the Cosmos' return in 2010, MLS was made up of 16 franchises, 
with three new teams set to join over the following two seasons: the Vancouver 
Whitecaps FC and Portland Timbers in 2011, and the Montreal Impact in 2012. 
Newsday reported in late April 2011 that the league was committed to placing 
the next franchise in the New York borough of Queens if a deal could be 
reached.[60] Terry Byrne said in July 2011 that the stadium was the biggest 
factor regarding the Cosmos' accession to MLS. "The league wants us to 
demonstrate that we are capable of taking a stadium [area] and building 
a stadium," he said.[61] Working alongside New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, 
the Cosmos sought a location within New York City's boroughs rather than 
a surrounding city (which would distinguish them from the Red Bulls, based 
in Harrison, New Jersey). Over a dozen locations around Queens, The Bronx, 
and Manhattan were marked out in March 2011,[35][61] narrowed down to four 
sites by the end of July; two in Queens and one each in Brooklyn and "uptown" 
Manhattan.[61] Apart from the stadium, an issue regarding MLS membership 
was the franchise fee that the Cosmos would have to pay to the league. 
When the club first announced its intention to join, the price stood at 
$40 million, but by the end of July 2011 the fee for any expansion team 
playing in New York had risen to $70 million, a 57% rise from the entry 
price paid by Montreal. At this time the club and league were in negotiations, 
which included talks over perhaps starting play at a temporary home stadium 
for "two or three years".[62] Negotiations broke down, in part due to the 
lack of a stadium plan and disputes over the league's single entity structure.[8] 
In May 2013, Major League Soccer announced that their 20th franchise would 
be a different New York–based team, New York City FC, a new team co-owned 
by Premier League team Manchester City and Major League Baseball team the 
New York Yankees.[63] Cosmos chairman Seamus O'Brien, however, noted that 
London had fourteen professional soccer teams, so New York City could "handle 
three."[64] In February 2014, MLS commissioner Don Garber named three other 
markets as candidates for the final expansion team that would get the league's 
stated 24-team target by 2020,[65] and on April 25, 2014, he told Associated 
Press's sports editors that there would not be a third MLS team in New
