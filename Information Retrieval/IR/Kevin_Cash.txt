Kevin Forrest Cash (born December 6, 1977) is a former American professional 
baseball catcher and coach. He is currently the manager of the Tampa Bay 
Rays of Major League Baseball (MLB). During his playing career, Cash played 
in MLB for the Toronto Blue Jays, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Boston Red Sox, 
New York Yankees, Houston Astros and Texas Rangers. He served as the bullpen 
coach for the Cleveland Indians, before being hired as the Rays' manager 
in December 2014. Cash played for Northside Little League in Florida when 
they made it to the Little League World Series in 1989. Cash played college 
baseball for the Florida State University Seminoles under head coach Mike 
Martin. He bats and throws right-handed. In the summer of 1999, he played 
for the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Played in 
College World Series 1998 and NCAA Runner-Up in 1999 at Florida State. 
He played sports video games but according to a person who was in his group 
of friends he was not that good. Cash played a total of 101 games from 
2002 to 2004 with the Toronto Blue Jays, serving mainly as a backup and 
defensive replacement. Cash joined the Devil Rays in 2005. On April 5, 
2006, the Devil Rays designated Cash for assignment, and after clearing 
waivers, reported to Triple-A Durham where he spent the entire 2006 season. 
Cash signed a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox on January 
24, 2007. On August 17, 2007, Red Sox backup catcher Doug Mirabelli pulled 
a calf muscle rounding third base in the first game of a doubleheader against 
the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Cash was flown to Boston from Ottawa 
(where the Pawtucket Red Sox were playing the Ottawa Lynx) to catch in 
the nightcap of the doubleheader. He made it to Fenway Park after the game 
had started. He started the game on August 19 against the Angels.[1] On 
November 2, 2007, Cash opted for free agency after refusing to accept an 
outright assignment to AAA Pawtucket. On December 13, 2007, Cash re-signed 
with the Red Sox to a minor league contract and an invitation to spring 
training. On March 25, 2008, Cash's contract was purchased. He acted as 
the personal catcher for knuckleball pitcher Tim Wakefield after Doug Mirabelli 
left the Sox. He was also notable for wearing his plastic catcher's cap 
forward (similar to how a field player wears a normal baseball cap) under 
his mask; normally, catchers will turn the cap around to provide stability 
for their mask. In Boston, Cash wore the uniform number 36, except from 
August 16, 2008 to the end of the 2008 season, due to Paul Byrd's joining 
the Red Sox and wearing his customary number 36. During this period, Cash 
switched to number 30. On December 12, 2008, Cash was non-tendered by the 
Red Sox, officially making him a free agent.[2] On December 23, 2008, Cash 
signed a minor league deal with the New York Yankees with an invitation 
to Spring Training.[3] He began the 2009 season with the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
Yankees. On May 8, Cash was called up due to injuries to both Jorge Posada 
and José Molina. He was optioned to AAA Scranton on May 29 and was placed 
on the injured reserve list after undergoing surgery to repair a torn rotator 
. Released by the New York Yankees' organization on September 5, 2009, 
Cash announced his retirement from baseball. However, he soon changed his 
mind, and on January 22, 2010, Cash signed a minor league contract with 
the Houston Astros. On May 5, 2010, Cash was called up to the Astros to 
replace a struggling J. R. Towles. He had 11 hits in 54 at bats with Houston. 
On July 1, 2010, Cash was acquired by the Red Sox for Ángel Sánchez after 
Jason Varitek went on the disabled list. As the backup catcher for the 
Red Sox for part of the season, he had 60 at bats and a .133 batting average, 
compiling just eight hits with the team. He finished the year with .167 
average (AL and NL stats combined). He refused a minor league assignment 
on October 12, and became a free agent. He signed a minor-league contract 
with the Texas Rangers on November 11, 2010, and played the entire 2011 
season at their Triple-A affiliate in Round Rock. On January 8, 2012, Cash 
announced his retirement. He was announced as an advanced scout for the 
Blue Jays during the 2012 season.[4] Shortly after the 2012 season ended, 
Cash joined Terry Francona's staff with the Cleveland Indians as their 
bullpen coach.[5] Cash played for Terry Francona during his stints with 
the Red Sox, and joined fellow Red Sox alumnus Brad Mills, who became Cleveland's 
bench coach. Mills was Terry Francona's bench coach while Cash played for 
the Red Sox, as well as Cash's manager with the Houston Astros in 2010.[citation

the team's general manager.[6] On December 5, 2014, the Tampa Bay Rays 
hired Cash as their manager, succeeding Joe Maddon.[7] He became the first 
home-grown player of Tampa to become manager[8] and became the first former 
Rays player to manage the team.[9] Cash, his wife Emily and their two daughters 
and son reside in Cleveland, Ohio. Cash is also the nephew of MLB player
