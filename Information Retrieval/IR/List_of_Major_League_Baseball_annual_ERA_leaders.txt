In baseball, earned run average (ERA) is a statistic used to evaluate pitchers, 
calculated as the mean of earned runs given up by a pitcher per nine innings 
pitched.[a] A pitcher is assessed an earned run for each run scored by 
a baserunner who reached base while batting against that pitcher, whether 
by hit, base on balls or "walk", or being hit by a pitched ball;[2] an 
earned run can be charged after the pitcher is relieved if he allows the 
runner before leaving the game.[3] Runs scored by players who reach base 
on errors, passed balls, or catcher interference under special circumstances 
are treated as unearned runs, and do not count towards the pitcher's ERA.[3] 
Major League Baseball recognizes the player in each league[b] with the 
lowest earned run average each season.[c] The first ERA champion in the 
National League was George Bradley; in the National League's inaugural 
1876 season, Bradley posted a 1.23 ERA for the St. Louis Brown Stockings, 
allowing 78 earned runs in 573 innings pitched.[4] The American League 
was established in 1901, and Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young led that league 
with a 1.62 ERA for the Boston Americans during the 1901 season.[5] Over 
the course of his 17-year major league career, Lefty Grove led the American 
League in ERA nine times, with a career single-season low of 2.06 for the 
1931 Philadelphia Athletics.[6] Roger Clemens has won the second-most ERA 
titles, capturing six in the American League and one in the National League.[7] 
Sandy Koufax led the National League in ERA for five consecutive seasons 
(1962–1966); Koufax' five awards are the most won consecutively by any 
player and are tied for the most awards in by a player in the National 
League with Christy Mathewson.[8][9] In the American League, Walter Johnson 
also won five ERA titles,[10] and Pedro Martínez has won a total of five 
(four American League and one National League) with two different teams.[11] 
The most recent ERA champions are Aaron Sanchez in the American League 
and Kyle Hendricks in the National League. The lowest single-season ERA 
in league history was posted by Tim Keefe, whose 0.86 ERA in 105 innings 
pitched for the National League's Troy Trojans in 1880 led his closest 
competitor by .52 runs.[12] In the American League, Dutch Leonard's 0.96 ERA 
is a single-season record.[13] Keefe and Leonard are the only two pitchers 
ever to allow less than one run per nine innings pitched in a single season. 
The widest margin of victory for an ERA champion is 1.96 runs, achieved 
when Martínez' 1.74 ERA led Clemens' 3.70 in the American League during 
the 2000 season. The largest margin of victory in the National League is 
1.26 runs—Dazzy Vance's 2.61 ERA over Carl Hubbell's 3.87 in 1930. The 
smallest margin of victory for an ERA champion is .009 runs. Although the 
statistic is traditionally recorded to two decimal places by most sources,[14][15][16] 
the 1988 American League title was decided by a margin of less than one 
hundredth of a run when Allan Anderson's ERA of 2.446 (55 earned runs in 
202 1⁄3 innings)[17] bested Teddy Higuera's 2.455 mark (62 earned runs 
in 227 1⁄3 innings).[18] Other contests decided by one hundredth or less 
include Luis Tiant's 1.91 ERA ahead of Gaylord Perry's 1.92 in 1972[19][20]
