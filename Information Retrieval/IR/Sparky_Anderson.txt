As player As manager George Lee "Sparky" Anderson (February 22, 1934 – 
November 4, 2010) was a Major League Baseball player, coach and manager. 
He managed the National League's Cincinnati Reds to the 1975 and 1976 championships, 
then added a third title in 1984 with the Detroit Tigers of the American 
League. He was the first manager to win the World Series in both leagues. 
His 2,194 career wins are the sixth most for a manager in Major League 
history. He was named American League Manager of the Year in 1984 and 1987. 
Anderson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2000. Anderson was 
born in Bridgewater, South Dakota, on February 22, 1934. He moved to Los 
Angeles when he was eight.[1] He was a batboy for the USC Trojans.[1] He 
attended Susan Miller Dorsey High School in Los Angeles.[2] Upon graduating, 
he was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as an amateur free agent in 1953.[3] 
Anderson's American Legion team won the 1951 national championship, which 
was played in Briggs Stadium (Tiger Stadium) in Detroit. He married Carol 
Valle on October 3, 1953. They had first met when each was in the fifth 
grade.[4] Anderson began his playing career with the Santa Barbara Dodgers 
of the class-C California League, where he was primarily used as a shortstop.[5] 
In 1954, he was moved up to the class-A Pueblo Dodgers of the Western League 
and was moved to second base, where he played the rest of his career.[5] 
In 1955, Anderson was moved another step up the minor league ladder, playing 
for the Double-A Fort Worth Cats of the Texas League. A radio announcer 
gave him the nickname "Sparky" in 1955 for his feisty play.[6] In 1956, 
he moved up once more, this time to the Triple-A Montreal Royals of the 
International League. In 1957, he was assigned to the Los Angeles Angels 
of the open-classification Pacific Coast League. The next season, after 
the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles, he returned to Montreal.[5] After five 
minor league seasons without appearing in a Dodger uniform at the MLB level, 
he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies on December 23, 1958 for three 
players, including outfielder Rip Repulski.[3] The Phillies gave Anderson 
their starting second base job, and he spent what would be his one full 
season in the major leagues in 1959. However, he batted only .218 in 152 
games, with no home runs and 34 runs batted in, and returned to the minor 
leagues for the remainder of his playing career. His 527 at-bats is still 
the record for the most by a player who only played in one Major League 
season.[7] He played the next four seasons with the Triple-A Toronto Maple 
Leafs in the International League.[5] After watching several practices, 
Leafs owner Jack Kent Cooke observed Anderson's leadership qualities and 
ability to teach younger players from all backgrounds. Cooke immediately 
encouraged him to pursue a career in managing, offering Anderson the post 
for the Leafs. In 1964, at the age of 30, Anderson accepted Cooke's offer 
to manage the Leafs. He later handled minor league clubs at the Class A 
and Double-A levels, including a season (1968) in the Reds' minor league 
system. During this period, he managed four pennant winners in four consecutive 
seasons: 1965 with the Rock Hill Cardinals of the Western Carolinas League, 
1966 with the St. Petersburg Cardinals of the Florida State League, 1967 
with the Modesto Reds of the California League, and 1968 with the Asheville 
Tourists of the Southern League. It was during the 1966 season that Anderson's 
club lost to Miami 4–3 in 29 innings, which remains the longest pro game 
played (by innings) without interruption.[8] He made his way back to the 
majors in 1969 as the third-base coach of the San Diego Padres during their 
maiden season in the National League. Just after the 1969 season ended, 
California Angels manager Lefty Phillips, who as a Dodger scout had signed 
the teenaged Anderson to his first professional contract,[9] named Anderson 
to his 1970 coaching staff. But within days of being hired in Anaheim, 
he was offered the opportunity to succeed Dave Bristol as manager of the 
Cincinnati Reds. His appointment reunited Anderson with Reds' general manager 
Bob Howsam, who had hired him as a minor-league skipper in the St. Louis 
Cardinals and Cincinnati organizations. Anderson was named the Reds manager 
on October 8, 1969. Since he was a relative unknown in the sports world, 
headlines on the day after his hiring read "Sparky Who?"[10] Nonetheless, 
Anderson led the Reds to 102 wins and the National League pennant in 1970,[11] 
where they lost the 1970 World Series in five games to the Baltimore Orioles. 
During this season, the Reds came to be widely known as The Big Red Machine, 
a nickname they carried throughout Anderson's tenure. After an injury-plagued 
1971 season in which the team finished fifth,[11] the Reds came back and 
won another pennant under Anderson in 1972, beating the Pittsburgh Pirates 
in five games in the NLCS, but losing to the Oakland Athletics in seven 
games in the World Series. They took the National League West division 
title again in 1973, but lost to the New York Mets in the NLCS, a hard-fought 
series that went the full five games. After finishing a close second to 
the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1974, in 1975 the Reds blew the division open 
by winning 108 games. They swept the National League Championship Series 
and then edged the Boston Red Sox in a drama-filled, seven-game World Series. 
They repeated in 1976 by winning 102 games, sweeping the Phillies in three 
games in the National League Championship Series, then going on to sweep 
the New York Yankees in the Series. This has been the only time that a 
team swept both the League Championship Series and World Series since the 
start of division play. Over the course of these two seasons, Anderson's 
Reds compiled an astounding 14–3 record in postseason play against the 
Pirates, Phillies, Red Sox and Yankees, winning their last eight in a row 
in the postseason after triumphing against the Red Sox in Game 7 of the 
1975 World Series, and then winning seven straight games in the 1976 postseason. 
They remain the only team to sweep the entire post-season since the inception 
of the league championship series in 1969. During this time, Anderson became 
known as "Captain Hook" for his penchant for taking out a starting pitcher 
at the first sign of weakness and going to his bullpen,[6][12] relying 
heavily on closers Will McEnaney and Rawly Eastwick. When the aging Reds 
finished second to the Dodgers in each of the next two seasons, Anderson 
was fired on November 27, 1978[12] by general manager Dick Wagner, who 
had taken over for Howsam a year earlier.[1] Wagner had wanted to "shake 
up" the Reds' coaching staff, to which Anderson objected, leading to his 
dismissal as well.[12] Under new manager John McNamara, the Reds won the 
division title again in 1979, but lost three straight to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in the League Championship Series. They would not make the playoffs 
again until they won the World Series in 1990 by sweeping the heavily favored 
Oakland A's. Anderson moved on to the young Detroit Tigers after being 
hired as their new manager on June 14, 1979. Upon seeing the team's young 
talent, he boldly proclaimed to the press that his team would be a pennant 
winner within 5 years.[13] The Tigers became a winning club almost immediately, 
finishing above .500 in each of Anderson's first three full seasons, but 
did not get into contention until 1983, when they won 92 games and finished 
second to the Baltimore Orioles in the American League East. In 1984, Detroit 
opened the season 9-0, was 35–5 after 40 games (a major league record), 
and breezed to a 104–58 record (a franchise record for wins). On September 
23, Anderson became the first manager to win 100 games in a season with 
two different teams.[8] They swept the Kansas City Royals in the American 
League Championship Series (ALCS) and then beat the San Diego Padres in 
five games in the World Series for Anderson's third world title. The 1984 
Tigers became the first team since the 1927 New York Yankees to lead a 
league wire-to-wire, from opening day to the end of the World Series. After 
the season, Anderson won the first of his two Manager of the Year Awards 
with the Tigers.[6] After the Tigers clinched the AL East division title 
in 1984, Anderson wrote in his journal: "I have to be honest. I’ve waited 
for this day since they fired me in Cincinnati. I think they made a big 
mistake when they did that. Now no one will ever question me again."[14] 
Anderson's Tigers finished in third place in both 1985 and 1986. With a 
9–5 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on July 29, 1986, Anderson became the 
first to achieve 600 career wins as a manager in both the American and 
National Leagues.[8] Anderson led the Tigers to the majors' best record 
in 1987, but the team was upset in the ALCS by the Minnesota Twins. He 
won his second Manager of the Year Award that year.[6] After contending 
again in 1988 (finishing second to Boston by one game in the AL East), 
the team collapsed a year later, losing a startling 103 games. During that 
1989 season, Anderson took a month-long leave of absence from the team 
as the stress of losing wore on him. First base coach Dick Tracewski managed 
the team in the interim.[15] In 1991, the Tigers finished last in batting 
average, first in batting strikeouts and near the bottom of the league 
in most pitching categories, but still led their division in late August 
before settling for a second-place finish behind the rival Toronto Blue 
Jays. On September 27, 1992, the Tigers beat the Cleveland Indians 13–3 
for Anderson's 1,132nd win with the team, passing Hughie Jennings as the 
all-time leader in wins by a Tiger manager. Anderson continues to hold 
this distinction with 1,331 victories with the Tigers. During his managerial 
career, Anderson was known to heap lavish praise on his ballplayers when 
talking to the media. He declared Kirk Gibson "the next Mickey Mantle", 
which he later acknowledged may have put too much pressure on Gibson early 
in his career. He said Mike Laga, who played for him in 1984, would "make 
us forget every power hitter who ever lived."[16] He also said Johnny Bench 
(who played for him in Cincinnati) "will never throw a baseball as hard 
as Mike Heath" (a catcher who played for him in Detroit). Anderson is the 
last American League manager to date to win a game by forfeit. This came 
a month after being hired in Detroit when, as a result of Disco Demolition 
Night in Chicago, the second half of a doubleheader with the Chicago White 
Sox had to be called off after an anti-disco demonstration went awry and 
severely damaged the playing surface at Comiskey Park. Even after White 
Sox groundskeepers removed debris from the field, Anderson refused to let 
the Tigers take the field. He was not only concerned for the safety of 
his players, but believed the field was unplayable. When American League 
officials initially made plans to postpone the game until the next afternoon, 
Anderson demanded that the game be forfeited to the Tigers. He argued that 
the White Sox, as the home team, were obligated to provide acceptable playing 
conditions. The next day, MacPhail largely upheld Anderson's argument and 
forfeited the second game to the Tigers, 9-0.[17][18] Anderson retired 
from managing on October 2, 1995,[8] reportedly disillusioned with the 
state of the league following the 1994 strike that had also delayed the 
beginning of the 1995 season. It is widely believed that Anderson was pushed 
into retirement by the Tigers, who were unhappy that Anderson refused to 
manage replacement players during spring training in 1995. In an interview 
on Detroit's WJR radio after his retirement, Anderson said he had told 
his wife that season, "If this is what the game has become, it don't need 
me no more." He finished with a lifetime record of 2,194–1,834,[19] for 
a .545 percentage[19] and the sixth most wins for a Major League manager.[1] 
He spent the largest portion of his career managing the Tigers (1970–78 
with the Reds, 1979–95 with the Tigers), winning the World Series twice 
with the Reds and once with the Tigers. Both during his tenure with the 
Tigers, and for a time thereafter, Anderson did some television work as 
a baseball commentator. From 1979 to 1986 (with the exception of 1984), 
Anderson was often paired with Vin Scully and later Jack Buck on CBS Radio's 
coverage of the World Series. From 1996 to 1998, he was a color analyst 
for the Anaheim Angels' cable television broadcasts. While still in Detroit, 
Anderson founded the charitable organization CATCH (Caring Athletes Teamed 
for Children's and Henry Ford hospitals) in 1987, which helps provide care 
for seriously ill children whose parents do not have health insurance or 
the means to otherwise pay for the care. He continued to support and participate 
in the charity well into his retirement.[20] When interviewed in 2008, 
Anderson said that CATCH was "the single best thing I ever did in Detroit."[21] 
Anderson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager in 2000. 
Although he managed 17 seasons in Detroit and just 9 seasons in Cincinnati, 
his Hall of Fame plaque has him wearing a Cincinnati Reds uniform. He chose 
to wear the Reds cap at his induction in honor of former GM Bob Howsam, 
who gave Anderson his first chance at a major-league managing job.[1] Before 
his induction, Anderson had refused to go inside the Hall because he felt 
unworthy, saying "I didn't ever want to go into the most precious place 
in the world unless I belonged."[6] In his acceptance speech he gave a 
lot of credit to his players, saying there were two kinds of managers, 
"One, it ain't very smart. He gets bad players, loses games and gets fired. 
There was somebody like me that was a genius. I got good players, stayed 
out of the way, let 'em win a lot, and then just hung around for 26 years."[1] 
He was very proud of his Hall induction, "I never wore a World Series ring ... 
I will wear this ring until I die."[1] Anderson was also inducted into 
the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame the same year. On May 28, 2005, during 
pre-game ceremonies in Cincinnati, Anderson's jersey number, #10, was retired 
by the Reds. A day in Anderson's honor was also held at Detroit's Comerica 
Park during the 2000 season. On June 17, 2006, Anderson's number was retired 
by the Fort Worth Cats, for whom Anderson had played in 1955.[22] In 2007, 
Anderson was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. Throughout 
the 2011 season the Tigers honored Anderson with a patch on their right 
sleeves. They officially retired his No. 11 on the brick wall at Comerica 
Park on June 26, 2011.[23] Anderson was the first manager to win a World 
Series for both a National League and American League team. Either manager 
in the 1984 Series would have been the first to win in both leagues, since 
San Diego Padres (NL) manager Dick Williams had previously won the series 
with the Oakland Athletics (AL) in 1972 and 1973. Williams' 1972 club had 
defeated Anderson's Reds club. Anderson's accomplishment was equalled in 
the 2006 World Series, when St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa—who 
had previously won the World Series with the Oakland Athletics in 1989, 
and who considers Anderson his mentor—led his team to the title over the 
Detroit Tigers. Coincidentally, having won a championship while managing 
the Florida Marlins in 1997, Tigers manager Jim Leyland could have achieved 
this same feat had the Tigers defeated La Russa's Cardinals in the 2006 
World Series. During that series, Anderson threw out the ceremonial first 
pitch of Game 2 at Comerica Park, the Tigers' home park. In 2006, construction 
was completed on the "Sparky Anderson Baseball Field" at California Lutheran 
University's new athletic complex. On November 3, 2010, it was announced 
that Anderson had been placed in hospice care at his Thousand Oaks home 
because of his deteriorating dementia condition.[24] Anderson died at the 
age 76 on Thursday, November 4, 2010 in Thousand Oaks.[6] He was survived 
by his wife of 57 years, Carol, sons Lee and Albert, daughter Shirlee Engelbrecht, 
and eight grandchildren.[6] Carol died at age 79 on May 7, 2013 at home 
in Thousand Oaks.[25] On June 26, 2011 the Detroit Tigers honored Anderson 
by retiring his number 11 from future use and placing his name and number 
on the outfield wall with the other past honorees and members of the Baseball 
Hall of Fame. Tiger players also wore commemorative patches on their uniform
