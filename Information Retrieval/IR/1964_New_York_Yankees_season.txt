WPIX The 1964 New York Yankees season was the 62nd season for the Yankees. 
The team finished with a record of 99–63, winning their 29th pennant, finishing 
1 game ahead of the Chicago White Sox. New York was managed by Yogi Berra. 
The Yankees played at Yankee Stadium. In the World Series, they were defeated 
by the St. Louis Cardinals in 7 games. Yogi Berra, taking over as manager 
from Ralph Houk, who in turn moved up to general manager, had a difficult 
early season, with many veterans missing games due to injury. Doubts about 
his ability to manage his former teammates were brought into the open with 
the Harmonica Incident in late August, in which he clashed with utility 
infielder Phil Linz on the team bus following a sweep by the Chicago White 
Sox that appeared to have removed the Yankees from pennant contention. 
The team rallied behind Berra afterwards, and won the pennant. However 
the incident may have convinced the team's executives to replace Berra 
with Johnny Keane, manager of the victorious Cardinals, after the season. 
This season is considered to be the endpoint of the "Old Yankees" dynasty 
that had begun with the Ruppert–Huston partnership and then continued with 
the Topping–Webb partnership. The Yankees would soon undergo ownership 
changes and front office turmoil, and would not be a serious factor in 
the pennant chase again until the early 1970s. On September 26, Mel Stottlemyre 
went 5 for 5, drove in two runs, and threw a two hit shutout.[2] [1] [2]

gained a 3–2 edge in overall Series wins over the Yankees, the first time 
any team had an overall edge against the Yankees since the 1920s. As of 
2009, the Cardinals remain the only one of the "classic eight" National
