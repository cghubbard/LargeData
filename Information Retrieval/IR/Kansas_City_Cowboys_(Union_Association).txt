The Kansas City Cowboys (also Unions and Kaycees) were a baseball team 
in the Union Association during its only season, 1884. Referred to as the 
"Cowboys" mostly by historians, they had no official nickname during their 
short life and were most frequently referred to by local press of the day 
as the "Unions" and by the press of other cities as the "Kaycees". They 
were the first professional baseball team to represent Kansas City as well 
as the city's first major league team. They began play as a replacement 
for the Altoona Mountain City, which collapsed in May, and played out the 
remainder of the season. Despite a 16-63 (.203 WL percentage) finish, the 
franchise was one of only two (the St. Louis club being the other) in the 
league to make a profit. In contemporary newspaper reports, the team had 
Altoona's record (6-19) combined with their own and were considered to 
have finished last in an eight-team league. The Unions disbanded shortly 
after the Union Association voted to dissolve. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
