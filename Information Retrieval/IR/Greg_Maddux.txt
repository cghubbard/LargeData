Gregory Alan "Greg" Maddux (born April 14, 1966), nicknamed "Mad Dog" and 
"The Professor", is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher 
now serving as a special advisor to Los Angeles Dodgers president of baseball 
operations Andrew Friedman. Maddux is best known for his accomplishments 
while playing for the Chicago Cubs and the Atlanta Braves . With the Braves, 
he won the 1995 World Series over the Cleveland Indians. The first to achieve 
a number of feats and records, he was the first pitcher in major league 
history to win the Cy Young Award for four consecutive years (1992–1995), 
matched by only one other pitcher, Randy Johnson. During those four seasons, 
Maddux had a 75–29 record with a 1.98 earned run average (ERA), while allowing 
less than one baserunner per inning.[1] Maddux is the only pitcher in MLB 
history to win at least 15 games for 17 straight seasons.[2] In addition, 
he holds the record for most Gold Gloves with eighteen. A superb control 
pitcher, Maddux won more games during the 1990s than any other pitcher 
and is 8th on the all-time career wins list with 355. Since the start of 
the post-1920 live-ball era, only Warren Spahn (363) recorded more career 
wins than Maddux. He is one of only 10 pitchers ever to achieve both 300 
wins and 3,000 strikeouts, and is the only pitcher to record over 300 wins, 
over 3,000 strikeouts, and fewer than 1,000 walks.[3] Since his retirement 
as a player, Maddux has also served as a special assistant to the general 
manager for both the Cubs and Texas Rangers. On January 8, 2014, he was 
voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, in his first year of eligibility, 
receiving 97.2% of the votes.[4] Maddux was born in San Angelo, Texas and 
spent much of his childhood in Madrid, Spain, where the United States Air 
Force stationed his father.[5] His father exposed him to baseball at an 
early age. Upon his return to Las Vegas, Nevada, Maddux and his brother 
Mike Maddux trained under the supervision of Ralph Meder, a former scout 
from the majors.[5] Meder preached the value of movement and location above 
velocity, and advised throwing softer when in a jam instead of harder. 
Maddux would later say, "I believed it. I don't know why. I just did." 
Though Meder died before Maddux graduated from Valley High School in Las 
Vegas in 1984, he instilled a firm foundation that would anchor Maddux's 
future career.[6] Maddux lives in the same community. While in Las Vegas, 
he played American Legion Baseball with Post 8. He was named the organization's 
Graduate of the Year in 1994.[7] Mike Maddux was drafted in 1982. When 
scouts went to observe the elder Maddux, their father Dave told them, "You 
will be back later for the little one."[8] Despite having a successful 
high school career, Maddux did not receive many[8] athletic scholarship 
offers to play college baseball.[9] This prompted Maddux to declare eligibility 
for the 1984 Major League Baseball draft after graduation. Some teams were 
unimpressed by Maddux's skinny build, but Chicago Cubs scout Doug Mapson 
saw past the physique. Mapson wrote a glowing review that read in part, 
"I really believe this boy would be the number one player in the country 
if only he looked a bit more physical."[10] Maddux was drafted in the second 
round of the 1984 Major League Baseball draft by the Cubs,[11][12] and 
made his major league debut on September 3, 1986, the conclusion of the 
September 2nd game which had been postponed due to darkness (lights were 
not installed at Wrigley Field until 1988). At the time, Maddux was the 
youngest player in the majors. His first appearance in a major league game 
was as a pinch runner (for catcher Jody Davis) in the 17th inning against 
the Houston Astros. Maddux then pitched in the 18th inning, allowing a 
home run to Billy Hatcher and taking the loss. His first start, five days 
later, was a complete game win. In his fifth and final start of 1986, Maddux 
defeated his older brother, who was pitching for the Philadelphia Phillies, 
marking the first time rookie brothers had pitched against each other. 
Mike Maddux was well used to his younger brother's competitive spirit, 
saying of their youth, "If Greg couldn't win, he didn't want to play, plain 
and simple."[13] In 1987, his first full season in the majors, Maddux struggled 
to a 6–14 record and 5.61 ERA, but he flourished in 1988, finishing 18–8 
with a 3.18 ERA. This began a streak of 17 straight seasons in which Maddux 
recorded 15 or more wins, the longest such streak in MLB history. Maddux 
established himself as the Cubs' ace in 1989, winning 19 games, including 
a September game at Montreal's Olympic Stadium that clinched the Cubs' 
second-ever National League Eastern Division championship. Manager Don 
Zimmer tabbed him to start Game One of the National League Championship 
Series against the San Francisco Giants. He allowed eight runs and was 
relieved after surrendering Will Clark's grand slam home run with two outs 
in the fourth. Maddux believed that just before the grand slam, Clark was 
able to read his lips during a conference at the mound between Maddux and 
Zimmer. After that incident, Maddux always covered his mouth with his glove 
during conversations on the mound.[14] Maddux took a no-decision in Game 
Four; the Cubs ended up losing the NLCS four-games-to-one. After consecutive 
15-win seasons in 1990 and 1991, Maddux won 20 games in 1992, tied for 
the NL lead, and was voted his first National League Cy Young Award. Free 
agency was pending for Maddux, but contract talks with the Cubs became 
contentious and eventually ceased. Both Chicago general manager Larry Himes 
and Maddux's agent, Scott Boras, accused the other of failing to negotiate 
in good faith. The Cubs eventually decided to pursue other free agents, 
including José Guzmán, Dan Plesac, and Candy Maldonado. After seven seasons 
in Chicago, Maddux signed a five-year, $28 million deal with the Atlanta 
Braves.[15] He made his debut with the Braves as their opening day starter 
against the Cubs at Wrigley Field, beating his former teammates 1–0. It 
was a good start to another strong season. He led the NL in ERA for the 
first time while posting a 20–10 record. Maddux won his second straight 
Cy Young Award, and the Braves took their rotation of Maddux, 22-game winner 
Tom Glavine, 18-game winner Steve Avery, and 15-game winner John Smoltz 
to the postseason. Maddux won against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 
Two of the NLCS, but with Atlanta trailing 3 games to 2, lost the decisive 
Game Six. During the strike-shortened 1994 season, Maddux posted an ERA 
of 1.56, the second lowest since Bob Gibson's historic 1.12 in 1968, the 
last year of the elevated mound, and the lowest in the majors since Dwight 
Gooden's 1.53 in 1985. It pleased Maddux that his 1994 batting average 
(.222) was higher than his ERA.[16] Maddux also led the National League 
in wins (with 16) and innings pitched (202) in his third Cy Young-winning 
year. Maddux also finished 5th in National League Most Valuable Player 
voting in 1994. In the following 1995 season, Maddux was 19–2 and posted 
the third-lowest ERA since Gibson's: 1.63. Maddux became the first pitcher 
to post back-to-back ERAs under 1.80 since Walter Johnson in 1918 (1.27) 
and 1919 (1.49). Maddux's 1.63 ERA came in a year when the overall league 
ERA was 4.23. Since the introduction of the live-ball era in 1920, there 
have only been five pitchers to have full-season ERAs under 1.65: Gibson 
and Luis Tiant in the anomalous 1968 season, Gooden in 1985, and Maddux, 
twice. Maddux's 19 wins led the National League, for the third time in 
four seasons. On May 28, 1995, he beat the Astros, losing a no-hitter on 
an eighth-inning home run to Jeff Bagwell. It was the only nine-inning 
one-hitter of his career.[17] In June and July, Maddux threw 51 consecutive 
innings without issuing a walk. Maddux pitched effectively in all three 
of the Braves's postseason series, winning a game in each. His Game One 
victory in the 1995 World Series involved nine innings, two hits, no walks, 
and no earned runs with Orel Hershiser pitching for the opposite team. 
Maddux took the loss in Game Five, but the Atlanta Braves won their first 
World Series championship two days later. Following the 1995 season, Maddux 
won his fourth straight Cy Young Award, a major league record, and his 
second consecutive unanimous award. Maddux also finished third in that 
year's National League Most Valuable Player voting. The Atlanta Braves 
also made good on a pre-season promise to their pitching rotation, installing 
a putting green in the locker room at the newly built Turner Field following 
the World Series victory. From 1996 to 1998, Maddux finished fifth, second, 
and fourth in the Cy Young voting. In August 1997, Maddux signed a $57.5-million, 
five-year contract extension that made him the highest-paid player in baseball.[15] 
In February 2003, he avoided arbitration by signing a one-year $14.75-million 
deal.[15] Maddux's production remained consistent: a 19–4 record in 1997, 
18–9 in 1998, 19–9 in both 1999 and 2000, 17–11 in 2001, 16–6 in 2002, 
and 16–11 in 2003, his last season as a Brave. From 1993 to 1998, Maddux 
led the National League in ERA four times, and was second the other two 
seasons. On July 22, 1997, Maddux threw a complete game with just 76 pitches 
against the Cubs. Three weeks earlier, he had shut out the defending champion 
New York Yankees on 84 pitches, and five days before that, he'd beaten 
the Phillies with a 90-pitch complete game. Maddux allowed just 20 bases 
on balls in 1997, including six intentional walks. Maddux struck out 200+ 
batters for the only time in his career in 1998. He outdueled the Cubs's 
Kerry Wood to clinch the NLDS, but the Braves were eliminated in the next 
round. The Braves returned to the World Series in 1999. Maddux was the 
Game One starter, and took a 1–0 lead into the eighth inning before a Yankee 
rally cost him the game and eventually the series as the Braves were swept. 
On June 14, 2000, Maddux made his 387th putout to break Jack Morris's career 
record.[16] In September 2000, he had a streak of 40 1⁄3 scoreless innings.[17] 
He pitched poorly in his one playoff start of 2000. In May 2001, Maddux 
became the first Braves pitcher since 1916 to throw two 1–0 shutouts in 
the same month. The first included a career-best 14 strikeouts.[17] In 
July and August of that year, Maddux pitched 72 1⁄3 consecutive innings 
without giving up a walk; that streak ended when he intentionally threw 
four balls to Steve Finley.[18] In 2002, he won his 13th straight Gold 
Glove Award, an NL record. Maddux tied Jim Kaat's career record of 16 Gold 
Gloves after the 2006 season. Throughout most of his years with the Braves, 
in the tradition of other pitching greats such as Steve Carlton, Maddux 
often had his own personal catcher. Though the Braves's primary catcher 
during much of that time was Javy Lopez, Maddux at various points used 
Charlie O'Brien, Eddie Pérez, Paul Bako, and Henry Blanco, for the majority 
of his starts, which were generally regarded as Lopez's day off, though 
Lopez did sometimes catch Maddux in his post-season starts. Maddux was 
the jewel in the much-vaunted Braves trio of Maddux, Glavine, and Smoltz, 
who pitched together for over a decade as the core of one of the best pitching 
staffs in the history of the game. The three were the linchpin of a team 
that won its division (the National League West in 1993 and the East from 
then on) every year that Maddux was on the team (1994 had no division champions). 
The three pitchers were frequently augmented by other strong starters such 
as Steve Avery, Kevin Millwood, Denny Neagle, and Russ Ortiz. In 1995, 
they pitched the Braves to a World Series title. In 29 postseason games 
with Atlanta, Maddux had a 2.81 ERA and a 1.19 WHIP, but just an 11–13 
record. Maddux returned to the Cubs as a free agent prior to the 2004 season, 
when he signed with them on February 18, 2004. Maddux got his first win 
on April 23 after losing 3 consecutive games at the beginning of the season. 
On August 7, Maddux defeated the San Francisco Giants, 8-4, to garner his 
300th career victory. In April 2005, he beat Roger Clemens for his 306th 
win in the first National League matchup between 300-game winners in 113 
years.[15] On July 26, 2005, Maddux struck out Omar Vizquel to become the 
thirteenth member of the 3,000 strikeout club and only the ninth pitcher 
with both 300 wins and 3,000 strikeouts, having reached both marks against 
the San Francisco Giants. Maddux finished as one of the four pitchers to 
top 3,000 strikeouts while having allowed fewer than 1,000 walks (he had 
999). The other three pitchers who have accomplished this feat are Ferguson 
Jenkins, Curt Schilling, and Pedro Martínez. Maddux's 13–15 record in 2005 
was his first losing record since 1987, and snapped a string of seventeen 
consecutive seasons with 15 or more wins. (Cy Young had surpassed the 15-win 
total for 15 straight years; both Young and Maddux reached 13+ wins for 
19 consecutive seasons. This is even more impressive considering that Cy 
Young pitched in an era with no more than 4 regular starters that would 
average more than 40+ games per season, whereas Maddux pitched in an era 
with a 5-man rotation where reaching 40 starts in a season was virtually 
unheard of.) Maddux's second stint with the Chicago Cubs lasted until mid-2006, 
when he was traded for the first time in his career, to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. At the time, the Dodgers were in the thick of a playoff race. 
In his first Dodger start, Maddux threw six no-hit innings before a rain 
delay interrupted his debut. In his next start, Maddux needed just 68 pitches 
to throw eight shutout innings. On August 30, 2006, he won his 330th career 
game, passing Steve Carlton to take sole possession of 10th on the all-time 
list. On September 30, 2006, Maddux pitched seven innings in San Francisco, 
allowing two runs and three hits in a 4–2 victory over the Giants, clinching 
a postseason spot for the Dodgers and notching another 15-win season. It 
was Maddux's 18th season among his league's Top 10 for wins, breaking a 
record he'd shared with Cy Young and Warren Spahn, who did it 17 times 
apiece. However, the Dodgers were swept in the first round of the playoffs 
by the Mets. Maddux started the third and final game, throwing an ineffective 
no-decision. Maddux was honored with a Fielding Bible Award as the best 
fielding pitcher in MLB for 2006.[19] On December 5, 2006, Maddux agreed 
to a one-year, $10 million deal with the San Diego Padres with a player 
option for the 2008 season, an option that Maddux later exercised at a 
reported $10 million.[20] Maddux earned his 338th victory in the game that 
Trevor Hoffman earned his milestone 500th save. On August 24, 2007, he 
won his 343rd game to take sole possession of ninth place on the all-time 
win list. He achieved another milestone with the same win, becoming the 
only pitcher in the major leagues to have 20 consecutive seasons with at 
least 10 wins and placing him second on the list for most 10-win seasons, 
tied with Nolan Ryan and behind Don Sutton, who has 21. Also in 2007, Maddux 
reached 13 wins for the 20th consecutive season, passing Cy Young for that 
major league record. He finished the season with a career total 347 wins. 
Maddux won a record 17th Gold Glove award in 2007. On May 10, 2008, Maddux 
won his 350th game. Maddux was traded back to the Los Angeles Dodgers on 
August 19 for two players to be named later or cash considerations by the 
San Diego Padres.[21] His return to Los Angeles was unlike his debut, though, 
as he allowed 7 earned runs on 9 hits while taking a loss against the Philadelphia 
Phillies. Maddux pitched his 5,000th career inning against the San Francisco 
Giants on September 19. On September 27, in his final start of the season, 
he won his 355th game, moving him ahead of Roger Clemens into 8th place 
in all-time wins. Maddux ranks tenth in career strikeouts with 3,371. His 
strikeout total is balanced against 999 walks. For the 2008 season, he 
posted an 8–13 record. His 1.4 walks per 9 innings pitched were the best 
in the majors.[22] After the Dodgers won the National League West, Maddux 
was moved to the bullpen after manager Joe Torre decided to go with a three-man 
rotation. Maddux pitched four innings of relief during the series (which 
the Dodgers lost), allowing no runs. Maddux was noted for his ability to 
warm up quickly. Maddux received his 18th Gold Glove Award in November 
2008, extending his own major league record.[23] A month later, he announced 
his retirement.[24] On January 11, 2010, Maddux was hired by the Chicago 
Cubs as an assistant to General Manager Jim Hendry. In his return to Chicago, 
his focus was on developing pitchers' styles and techniques throughout 
the organization, including minor league affiliates.[25] For the 2012 season 
Maddux left his position with the Cubs and joined the Texas Rangers organization, 
where his brother Mike was the pitching coach. He was announced as the 
pitching coach for the USA team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic.[26] 
On February 2, 2016, he was hired by the Dodgers as a special assistant 
to the President of Baseball Operations, Andrew Friedman.[27] On July 6, 
2016 Maddux was hired as an assistant baseball coach for the University 
of Nevada, Las Vegas. He will serve as the pitching coach of the Hustlin' 
Rebs. Greg's son, Chase is a sophomore pitcher for the Rebels.[28] Maddux 
relied on his command, composure, and guile to outwit hitters. Though his 
fastball touched 93 mph in his early years,[29] his velocity steadily declined 
throughout his career, and was never his principal focus as a pitcher. 
By the end of his career, his fastball averaged less than 86 mph.[30] Maddux 
was also noted for the late movement on his sinker (two-seam fastball), 
which, combined with his control, made him known as an excellent groundball 
pitcher.[31] While Maddux was not known for his strikeout totals, his strikeout 
totals have often been undersold because strikeout rate has often been 
measured per nine innings, rather than per batter faced.[32] Maddux alternated 
his two-seam fastball with an excellent circle changeup. Though these served 
as his primary pitches, he also threw a four-seam fastball, a cutter, a 
curveball, a slider, and a splitter.[30][33] Maddux was renowned for focusing 
on the outside corner. This approach was emphasized under former Atlanta 
Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone. He would begin by throwing strikes with 
his fastball down and away, then expand the strike zone with his changeup—sometimes 
obtaining borderline strike calls from umpires simply on the strength of 
his reputation.[34] In complement with this strategy, Maddux popularized 
a tactic of throwing his two-seam fastball off the plate inside to left-handed 
hitters, only to have the ball break back over the inside corner for a 
strike.[35] Maddux said of that pitch, "That was just my normal fastball 
that did that. ... I always had it. The pitch really started to work for 
me when I ... learned how to throw a cutter, it made that pitch more effective."[36] 
In addition, his propensity for throwing strikes and avoiding walks kept 
his pitch counts low. On July 2, 1997 he won a game against the New York 
Yankees, for example, with the numbers "nine innings, three hits, no walks, 
eight strikeouts, one pickoff, one double play, 84 pitches ... [in] two 
hours and nine minutes".[37] Dodgers general manager Fred Claire admired 
Maddux's pitching consistency, saying "It's almost like a guy lining up 
a 60-foot-6-inch putt ... he is just so disciplined, so repetitive in his 
pitches."[38] Speaking about Maddux's accuracy, Orel Hershiser said, "This 
guy can throw a ball in a teacup."[39] Baseball Hall of Famer Wade Boggs 
talked about facing Maddux: "It seems like he's inside your mind with you. 
When he knows you're not going to swing, he throws a straight one. He sees 
into the future. It's like he has a crystal ball hidden inside his glove."[40] 
Maddux was also known for intensely studying hitters in preparation for 
his starts. He would often watch hitters take their warmup swings or read 
their body language to gauge their mentality.[35] Teammate Tom Glavine 
said, "I think the hitters think he can go back and recall every pitch 
he has ever thrown. That's not the case, but I think he's probably better 
at remembering things than most people are. He's definitely better in the 
course of the game at making adjustments on a hitter based on what he's 
seen, whether it's one swing or a guy's last at-bat."[41] Maddux was a 
highly durable pitcher, leading the National League in innings pitched 
in five consecutive years. He also had outstanding control, finishing with 
the lowest BB/9 ratio in the NL nine times. He also was the most celebrated 
fielding pitcher of his day, with a record 18 Gold Gloves to his credit 
and the third-highest range factor per 9 innings among all Major League 
pitchers.[42] Finally, Maddux has been praised for his superior pitching 
mechanics, helping him avoid serious arm injuries throughout his lengthy 
career.[35][43] One analyst of pitching mechanics wrote, "Maddux's sterling 
reputation for pitching mechanics is more than justified. He could repeat 
his delivery as well as any pitcher that I have ever seen, with consistent 
timing and positioning that persisted regardless of pitch type or pitch 
count, giving the impression that he was never fatigued."[44] Maddux has 
been credited by many of his teammates with a superior ability to outthink 
his opponents and anticipate results. Braves catcher Eddie Pérez tells 
the story of Maddux intentionally allowing a home run to the Astros's Jeff 
Bagwell, in anticipation of facing Bagwell in the playoffs months later. 
Maddux felt Bagwell would instinctively be looking for the same pitch again, 
which Maddux would then refuse to throw.[45] On another occasion while 
sitting on the bench, Maddux once told his teammates, "Watch this, we might 
need to call an ambulance for the first base coach." The batter, Los Angeles' 
José Hernández, drove the next pitch into the chest of the Dodgers' first 
base coach. Maddux had noticed that Hernández, who'd been pitched inside 
by Braves pitching during the series, had shifted his batting stance slightly.[13] 
On another occasion, a former teammate, outfielder Marquis Grissom, recalled 
a game in 1996 when Maddux was having trouble spotting his fastball. Between 
innings, he told Grissom, "Gary Sheffield is coming up next inning. I am 
going to throw him a slider and make him just miss it so he hits it to 
the warning track." The at-bat went as Maddux had predicted. Early in the 
2000 season, Maddux was asked by sportswriter Bob Nightengale what had 
been the most memorable at-bat of his pitching career. Maddux said it was 
striking out Dave Martinez to end a regular season game. Nightengale was 
surprised Maddux hadn't picked a postseason game, or a more famous player. 
Maddux explained: "I remember that one because he got a hit off me in the 
same situation (full count, bases loaded, two out in the 9th inning) seven 
years earlier. I told myself if I ever got in the same situation again, 
I'll pitch him differently. It took me seven years, but I got him."[13] 
Publicly, however, Maddux is dismissive of his reputation, saying, "People 
think I'm smart? You know what makes you smart? Locate your fastball down 
and away. That's what makes you smart. You talk to Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, 
or Tom Seaver. They'll all tell you the same thing. It's not your arm that 
makes you a great pitcher. It's that thing between both of your ears we 
call a brain." To this day, Maddux maintains Koufax, Gibson, and Seaver 
are the three best pitchers of the "live ball" era of baseball.[46] Informed 
by "The Sporting News" he had been voted best pitcher of the 1990s, he 
replied, "It [the award] could have gone to Glavine or Smoltz just as easily 
and each would have deserved it. They're both great pitchers." Maddux never 
walked more than 82 batters in any season of his career, averaging fewer 
than 2 walks per game. In 1997, Maddux allowed 20 walks in 232+ innings, 
or 0.77 per 9 innings. In 2001, he set a National League record by going 
72 1⁄3 innings without giving up a walk. Maddux's low walk totals also 
kept his pitch counts down, enabling him to go deeper into games. In 31 
starts, Maddux threw 9 innings with 100 or fewer pitches. Ten of those 
starts were under 90 pitches, including a 76-pitch complete game in July 
1997,[47] the most efficient start by any pitcher since 1979. In addition 
to his pitching skills, Maddux was an excellent fielding pitcher. He won 
18 Gold Gloves, the all-time record for any position. Of his 18 total awards, 
Maddux won 10 with the Braves, five with the Cubs, two with the Dodgers 
and one with the Padres. Maddux was also a reliable hitting pitcher, with 
a career .172 batting average including four seasons batting .200 or better. 
Maddux pitched in 13 Division Series contests, 17 League Championship games 
and five World Series games.[2] He has a 3.27 ERA in 198 postseason innings, 
including an outstanding 2.09 ERA in 38.7 World Series innings.[2] He was 
chosen for the National League All-Star team eight times.[2] Maddux won 
20 games only twice, in 1992 and 1993.[2] However, he won 19 games five 
times (including the 1995 season which was reduced to 144 games from the 
strike of 1994), 18 games twice, and 16 in the strike shortened 1994 season 
(which was reduced to 115 games).[2] He won four ERA titles (in 1993–1995 
and 1998), and led the NL in shutouts five times.[2] He holds the major 
league record for seasons leading his league in games started (7).[48] 
He also holds the record for most seasons finishing in the top 10 in the 
league in wins (18).[49] In his 2009 book, "The Annual Baseball Gold Mine" 
baseball statistics guru Bill James found Maddux to be far and away the 
most underrated player in baseball history. The methodology for this included 
the fact that though Maddux only won 20 games twice, he won 19 games five 
times. He also had only one season of 200 or more strikeouts but had seasons 
of 199, 198 and 197, respectively, which diminished his reputation as a 
strikeout pitcher. In addition to that James also argued that although 
he had 18 seasons of 200 or more innings pitched, he also had three seasons 
of 199.1, 198 and 194 innings pitched. In 1999, Maddux ranked 39th on The 
Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, the highest-ranking 
pitcher then active. He was also nominated as a finalist for the Major 
League Baseball All-Century Team. However, when TSN updated their list 
in 2005, Maddux had fallen to number 51. The Cubs retired jersey number 
31 on May 3, 2009 in honor of both Maddux and Ferguson Jenkins. The Atlanta 
Braves retired Maddux's number 31, on July 17, 2009. "I get asked all the
