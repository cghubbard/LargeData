David John Giusti, Jr. (born November 27, 1939) is a retired Major League 
Baseball pitcher who played from 1962 to 1977. While attending and playing 
baseball for Syracuse University, Giusti pitched in the 1961 College World 
Series as a starting pitcher. He signed out of a college as a free agent 
with the Houston Colt .45s (later the Houston Astros), and played in Houston 
from 1962-68. Shortly before the 1968 expansion draft, Giusti was traded 
to the St. Louis Cardinals, who left him unprotected, and he was then drafted 
by the San Diego Padres. Two months later, Giusti was then traded back 
to the Cardinals. After the 1969 baseball season, Giusti was traded to 
the Pittsburgh Pirates. With the Pirates, he was converted into a relief 
pitcher by manager Danny Murtaugh, and Giusti soon became one of the leading 
relief pitchers in the National League. Using his sinking palmball heavily, 
Giusti recorded 20 or more saves in each of the next four baseball seasons, 
and he led the National League with 30 saves in 1971 for the Pirates. Giusti 
appeared in three games for Pittsburgh in the 1971 World Series, earning 
a save in Game Four. Giusti was awarded The Sporting News Reliever of the 
Year Award in 1971. In 1973, Giusti was selected for the National League's 
All-Star Team. Giusti pitched a one-two-three seventh inning as the National 
League won the game 7-1.[1] Shortly before the beginning of the 1977 season, 
he was traded to the Oakland Athletics as part of a ten-player trade â€“ 
one that also sent outfielder Tony Armas to Oakland, and sent infielder 
Phil Garner to Pittsburgh. In August, the Athletics sold Giusti's contract 
to the Chicago Cubs with whom Giusti finished the season, and after being 
released by the Cubs in November, Giusti retired from baseball. Giusti's 
most valuable baseball pitch was his palmball. After his baseball career, 
Giusti became a corporate sales manager for American Express. As of 2002,
