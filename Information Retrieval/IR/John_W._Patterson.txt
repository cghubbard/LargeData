John W. Patterson (March 2, 1872 â€“ August 23, 1940) was an African-American 
baseball outfielder in the Negro Leagues. He played for major teams from 
1893 to 1907. Patterson debuted with the Lincoln, Nebraska Giants of 1890, 
a black team, and played for the Plattsmouth club in the Nebraska State 
League during the 1892 season, before the baseball color line was sharply 
drawn. In 1893 he joined the Cuban Giants and won a starting position for 
1894. He played with the Page Fence Giants[2] which eventually became the 
Chicago Columbia Giants in 1899 where Patterson was a manager and outfielder. 
He appeared on teams lists in Chicago from 1899 to 1902,.[3] then played 
a year for the Philadelphia Giants, then moved on to the Cuban X-Giants, 
then the Brooklyn Royal Giants. Fellow 1904 teammate Jimmy Smith called 
Patterson "one of the brainiest and shrewdest leaders of any team of color."[5]
