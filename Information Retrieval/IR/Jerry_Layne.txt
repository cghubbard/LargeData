Jerry Blake Layne (born September 28, 1958) is an umpire in Major League 
Baseball who has worked in the National League between 1989 and 1999, and 
throughout both major leagues since 2000. He wore uniform number 24 in 
the NL, but when MLB merged the AL and NL umpiring staffs in 2000, Layne 
was forced to switch to number 26, as AL umpire Al Clark, who wore 24 in 
the junior circuit, had more seniority. When Clark was fired midway through 
the 2000 season by MLB, Layne reclaimed number 24 and has worn it ever 
since. In October 2005, he umpired in his first World Series. He was also 
the home plate umpire when Barry Bonds hit his record 71st home run in 
2001, and for the no-hitter pitched by Fernando Valenzuela of the Los Angeles 
Dodgers on June 29, 1990 at Dodger Stadium. Layne was chosen as one of 
the umpires for the one-game Wild Card playoff between the Baltimore Orioles 
and the Texas Rangers on October 5, 2012.[1] In 2014, he was chosen as 
one of the three MLB umpire representatives for the Japan All-Star Series.[2] 
On August 18, 2006, Layne was the plate umpire for a game between the Atlanta 
Braves and the Florida Marlins. In the 8th inning, he was struck by the 
barrel of a broken bat swung by the Marlins' Hanley Ramírez. Layne's injury 
delayed the game for 13 minutes, and he was carted off the field. X-rays 
were negative and Layne escaped serious injury, suffering only a bruised 
jaw.[3] On June 7, 2008, Layne was the plate umpire where he sustained 
a mild concussion when he was hit by a foul ball in the top of the third 
inning of a game between the New York Yankees and Kansas City Royals.[4] 
While serving as the plate umpire during a June 2012 game between the Minnesota 
Twins and the Cincinnati Reds, Layne was struck in the side of the head 
by a piece of Devin Mesoraco's broken bat. Layne would leave the game, 
being replaced behind the plate by Bob Davidson.[5] On April 19, 2016, 
Layne injured his right leg after jumping and landing awkwardly while attempting 
to avoid being hit by a batted ball.[6] On June 17, 1997, Layne ejected 
Cincinnati Reds manager Ray Knight for arguing after Layne ruled that Cincinnati's 
Deion Sanders was out at third base. After he was thrown out, Knight kicked 
dirt on the base and then picked it up and hurled it to the ground.[7] 
In August 2003, Layne ejected Kansas City Royals catcher Mike DiFelice 
after Layne ruled that Minnesota Twin Torii Hunter was safe in a play at 
the plate. Following his ejection, DiFelice threw a glove into the crowd 
and also tossed a pair of water coolers as well as a trash can out of the 
dugout.[8] On October 19, 2011, Layne was the plate umpire when Adrián 
Beltré nicked a ball off of his foot to St. Louis Cardinals third basemen 
David Freese in Game 1 of the 2011 World Series, which, by rule, is a dead 
ball. Layne ruled that Beltre was not touched by the ball and play continued, 
despite Beltre hopping around home plate as if in pain. Infrared replays 
showed that the ball appeared to have narrowly clipped Beltre's foot and 
that the ball should have been called foul or dead by virtue of batter's 
interference. Layne inspected the ball after Rangers manager Ron Washington 
argued the call; however Layne did not see any scuff from Beltre's shoe 
and upheld his original call.[9] On October 28, 2011, Layne was the plate 
umpire for Game 7 of the 2011 World Series, as the St. Louis Cardinals 
hosted the Texas Rangers. During this contest, baseball's computerized 
Pitch f/x system indicated Layne missed 17 ball/strike calls, with 14 of 
these calls benefiting the Cardinals and three benefiting the Rangers.[10] 
Most notably, with St. Louis leading 3-2 in the bottom of the fifth inning, 
the Cardinals loaded the bases as Yadier Molina stepped to the plate with 
two outs. Molina took a 3-2 fastball from Scott Feldman for a called fourth 
ball, allowing a run to score as opposed to ending the inning had the pitch 
been called a strike. Pitch f/x indicates the pitch was located within
