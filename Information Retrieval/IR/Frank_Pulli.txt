Frank Victor Pulli (March 22, 1935 – August 28, 2013) was a baseball umpire, 
working in the National League from 1972 until 1999. During his career, 
he officiated in four World Series (1978, 1983, 1990 (crew chief), and 
1995), six National League Championship Series (1975, 1979, 1986, 1991, 
1993, and 1997), four National League Division Series (1981, 1995, 1996 
and 1998), and two All-Star games (1977 and 1988--crew chief). He also 
officiated in the April 8, 1974 game in which Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's 
home run record.[1] Pulli was born in Easton, Pennsylvania and died in 
Palm Harbor, Florida on August 28, 2013, due to complications from Parkinson's 
disease.[2] Pulli wore uniform number 14 during his career. Pulli was involved 
in a controversial play in Game 4 of the 1978 World Series. In the 6th 
inning, New York Yankees outfielder Lou Piniella hit a low line drive to 
shortstop. Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Bill Russell dropped the ball 
momentarily (not ruled a catch by second base umpire Joe Brinkman), then 
flipped it to second baseman Davey Lopes, but Lopes' throw to first caromed 
off the leg of Reggie Jackson, standing in the baseline between first and 
second, and went behind first base. Thurman Munson scored (in part due 
to Steve Garvey stopping to argue before chasing the ball down) to make 
it a 3-2 game, but Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda immediately argued that 
Jackson should have been called out for interference. Pulli (umpiring at 
first base) maintained that Jackson did not "intentionally" interfere with 
the throw (despite Jackson ever-so-slightly shifting his leg to cause the 
ball to hit it) and the play stood. The Yankees went on to win Game 4, 
4-3 in 10 innings, then the series in Game 6. In his autobiography, Jackson 
described his involvement in the play as a "sacrifice thigh."[3] Pulli 
was the first AL, NL, or MLB umpire to use Instant Replay in a game. In 
1999, the Marlins were hosting the Cardinals when Pulli used Instant Replay 
to review a home run call he had made.[4] The Marlins' Cliff Floyd had 
hit a ball to the top of the left field scoreboard, near the yellow line 
that separated in- from out-of-play. Originally ruled a home run, Pulli 
reversed the call to a double, after consulting a dugout TV monitor. The 
Cardinals won the game, 5-2. After the game, the NL League Office declared 
the umpires erred in using Instant Replay. MLB would not use Instant Replay 
again for almost a decade.[5] Along with fellow umpire, Rich Garcia, Pulli 
was placed on probation by baseball commissioner Fay Vincent, in 1989 when 
he learned that they had placed bets on non-baseball sporting events with 
an illegal bookmaker. Don Zimmer, who at the time was the manager of the 
Chicago Cubs, was also placed on probation by Vincent for the same offense.[6] 
Pulli was also one of 22 umpires who participated in the 1999 Major League 
Umpires Association mass resignation, orchestrated by the association’s 
executive director, Richie Phillips. In response to the resignation, major 
league baseball hired replacement umpires.[7] Subsequently, Pulli was one 
of thirteen umpires who was not rehired by the league. Instead he was allowed 
to retire and was later hired back as an umpire supervisor.[6] After his 
retirement, Pulli’s experience as an umpire was instrumental in baseball’s 
use of the QuesTec, an advanced technology that allowed baseball to observe 
and grade the home plate umpire’s ability to call balls and strikes. Many 
umpires, including Ted Barrett, believed that the use of the technology 
dramatically changed the way umpires judged the strike zone and that he, 
and others, adjusted their calls to the technology. In Bruce Weber’s 2009 
book on umpiring, Barrett claimed that Pulli would call him after games 
and encourage him to shrink his strike zone after watching Barrett call
