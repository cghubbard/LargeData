Miguel Odalis Tejada (born Tejeda,[1][2] May 25, 1974) is a Dominican former 
professional baseball shortstop. Tejada played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the Oakland Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, Houston Astros, San 
Diego Padres, San Francisco Giants and Kansas City Royals. Tejada spent 
his first six seasons in MLB with the Athletics, where he began a streak 
of 1,152 consecutive games that ended with the Orioles on June 22, 2007. 
He is a six-time All-Star and a two-time Silver Slugger Award winner. In 
2002, he won the American League Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, and 
he was the 2005 All-Star Game MVP. Tejada's nickname is "La Guagua", which 
means "the bus" in certain Spanish dialects, as Tejada was known for his 
ability to drive in runs. On February 11, 2009, he pleaded guilty to one 
count of perjury for lying to Congress in his testimony on whether or not 
Rafael Palmeiro lied about his steroid use.[3] On August 17, 2013, Major 
League Baseball suspended Tejada for 105 games for violating the organization's 
drug policy. It was the third longest non-lifetime suspension ever issued 
by MLB for a drug-related violation.[4][5] Tejada grew up in extreme poverty 
in Baní, a city approximately 40 miles (65 km) southwest of Santo Domingo, 
capital of the Dominican Republic. He grew up idolizing the Baltimore Orioles 
shortstop Cal Ripken Jr.[6] Tejada's rise from the slums of Baní through 
the minors and into the Major Leagues is chronicled in the book Away Games: 
The Life and Times of a Latin Ballplayer by Marcos Breton and Jose Luis 
Villegas. Away Games describes the struggles of Dominican players in general 
and Tejada in particular as they arrive in the U.S. speaking very little 
English often in small towns playing for minor league teams with dreams 
of making it big.[7] Tejada developed quickly into a top-notch prospect, 
showing early signs of power. He reached the Majors towards the end of 
the 1997 season, joining a struggling Oakland Athletics club. Though he 
only hit .202 in 26 games that year, the A's saw potential in the 23-year-old 
Tejada. This was bolstered by his performance with the Edmonton Trappers 
(AAA) in the Pacific Coast League during the season, and returning to the 
minors to lead the Trappers to a PCL championship that year. He was rewarded 
with the starting shortstop job beginning in 1998. The A's, and Tejada, 
steadily improved over the next two years. His hitting improved as he gained 
more discipline at the plate. In 1998, he hit .233 with 11 home runs and 
in 1999 his average jumped to .251 with 21 home runs. After a solid 87-win 
campaign in 1999, Tejada and a core of young players led their A's to their 
first American League Western Division title in eight years in 2000. Bolstered 
by an American League MVP-winning performance by first baseman Jason Giambi, 
and aided by Tejada's .275 average and 30 home runs, the A's won 91 games. 
The A's faced the New York Yankees in the first round of the postseason, 
which was won by the Yankees 3-2. In 2001, Tejada had a comparable offensive 
year, hitting .267 with 31 homers. The A's captured the American League 
wild card with a 102-60 record. In the postseason, however, the A's fell 
to the Yankees in five games, blowing an initial 2-0 series lead. Tejada's 
breakout year came in 2002. With the departure of Jason Giambi to the New 
York Yankees during the offseason, and a leg injury to slugger Jermaine 
Dye, the A's lost two of their key offensive players. Tejada hit .308 with 
34 homers and led the A's to their second Western Division title in three 
years. Their campaign included an American League record 20 game winning-streak. 
Tejada contributed one-out, game-winning hits in the 18th and 19th games 
of that run: a three-run homer off Minnesota Twins closer Eddie Guardado 
for a 7-5 victory and a bases-loaded single against Kansas City Royals 
reliever Jason Grimsley to break a 6-6 tie. Tejada also showed modest speed 
on the basepaths with 18 steals over a two-year stretch. His performance 
was rewarded with the 2002 American League MVP award. For the third straight 
year, though, the A's fell in the fifth game of the ALDS, this time to 
the Minnesota Twins. The next year, both the A's and Tejada got off to 
a slow start, with the shortstop hitting under .200 for the first month 
of the season. Improved play in the second half of the season led the A's 
to their second straight Western Division title and their third in four 
years. Tejada hit .278 with 27 homers for the year, a decrease from his 
numbers in 2002, but still leading many offensive categories for shortstops. 
In a tension-filled series, the powerful offense of the Boston Red Sox 
narrowly edged out the A's in the first round, once again in five games. 
Tejada was known for his public display of anger toward Boston starting 
pitcher Derek Lowe at the series' conclusion for what he perceived as obscene 
gestures. Lowe denied the accusation, claiming his fist pump was in celebration 
only.[8][9] By the end of the 2003 season, Tejada had established himself 
as one of baseball's premier shortstops. The A's elected not to re-sign 
the free agent, citing budget concerns and a young Bobby Crosby coming 
through the system, so Tejada signed a six-year, $72 million deal with 
the Baltimore Orioles during the offseason. On arrival in Baltimore, Tejada 
was given uniform number 10, since 4, his number in Oakland, had been retired 
for former manager Earl Weaver. As an Oriole, Tejada followed in the footsteps 
of legendary Baltimore shortstop Cal Ripken Jr.. Like Ripken, Tejada was 
a strong and durable shortstop with unusual power numbers for a middle 
infielder. On July 12, 2004, Tejada won the Century 21 Home Run Derby in 
Houston. Tejada hit a (then) record 27 home runs in the contest, including 
a record 15 homers in the second round. He defeated Houston Astros outfielder 
Lance Berkman (who would later become his teammate) 5-4 in the final round 
of the contest.[10] Both records were broken the following year in Detroit 
by Bobby Abreu. Tejada led the league with 150 RBI in 2004. While Tejada 
did not participate in the Home Run Derby in 2005, he was an All-Star and 
starter for the AL. In his first All-Star start, Tejada hit a solo home 
run against John Smoltz of the Atlanta Braves, had a sacrifice RBI and 
was part of an all-Oriole double play with teammate Brian Roberts. His 
efforts earned him the All-Star MVP, winning a Chevrolet Corvette. On December 
8, 2005, it was widely reported by the Associated Press that Tejada asked 
the Orioles for a trade, citing unhappiness with the team's direction. 
Tejada challenged those statements in an interview with Comcast Sportsnet's 
Kelli Johnson, saying he only asked for a better team, referring to his 
hope that the Baltimore Orioles would improve after their eighth straight 
losing season.[citation needed] Several weeks later, Tejada reiterated 
his complaints with the Orioles' lack of action and demanded to be traded.[citation 
needed] Tejada stated that he wants a "good group that helps me to win" 
and commented briefly on his alleged non-involvement in Palmeiro's steroid 
scandal. On January 7, 2006, Tejada stated his intent to remain with Baltimore 
for "the rest of [his] career."[citation needed] This statement was made 
to Orioles Vice President Jim Duquette in a meeting arranged by mutual 
friend and teammate Melvin Mora. It was reported that Tejada was claimed 
by the Chicago White Sox off trade waivers, but the two teams did not make 
a deal for Tejada.[citation needed] Tejada played in his 1,000th consecutive 
game on July 1, 2006. Tejada's streak was at 1,151 games when he was hit 
on his left wrist by a pitch on June 20, 2007. The next day, he went up 
to bunt in the top of the first inning, bunted into a force play, and was 
replaced by a pinch runner. Following that game, it was announced that 
he had a broken wrist. On June 22 he was placed on the disabled list, ending 
his streak at 1,152 consecutive games, the fifth longest in Major League 
history, behind Cal Ripken, Jr. (2,632), Lou Gehrig (2,130), Everett Scott 
(1,307), and Steve Garvey (1,217).[11] On December 12, 2007, Tejada was 
dealt to the Houston Astros for five players, including SP Troy Patton, 
OF Luke Scott, RP Dennis Sarfate and RP/SP Matt Albers.[12] Tejada scored 
his 1,000th career run on July 7, 2008, at PNC Park. In the 2008 All-Star 
Game Tejada singled leading off the top of the eighth stole second with 
one out and advanced to third on a throwing error and scored on Padres' 
first baseman Adrian Gonzalez"s sacrifice fly. In the 2008 season he grounded 
into 32 double plays, the most in the major leagues.[13] In 2009, he again 
led the majors in grounding into double plays, this time with 29.[14] On 
January 23, 2010, Tejada agreed to a one-year deal worth $6 million with 
the Orioles.[15] On July 29, the Orioles traded Tejada to the San Diego 
Padres for minor league pitcher Wynn Pelzer.[16][17] On September 22, Tejada 
hit his 300th career home run off Ted Lilly of the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
Tejada signed a one-year, $6.5 million, contract with the San Francisco 
Giants.[18] He was designated for assignment on August 31, 2011 after batting 
.239 with four home runs and 26 RBIs in 91 games.[19] He was released on 
September 8, 2011.[20] On May 6, 2012, Tejada reached an agreement on a 
contract with the Orioles.[21][22] He failed to make the Major League club's 
roster however, and played for their Triple-A affiliate Norfolk team until 
requesting his outright release, which was granted on June 25, 2012.[23] 
On December 31, 2012, Tejada signed a minor league contract with the Kansas 
City Royals. According to the Associated Press, he will earn $1.1 million 
plus performance incentives worth an additional $400,000 if he makes the 
Royals Major League 40-man roster for 2013.[23] On August 17, 2013, Tejada 
received a 105-game suspension from Major League Baseball following two 
positive drug tests for amphetamines. Tejada claimed to have been in the 
process of re-applying for a therapeutic use exemption as he used the drug 
to treat a medical condition, but he chose not to appeal the decision. 
Due to a calf injury suffered prior to the ban, Tejada was not likely to 
play in the remaining 41 games of the 2013 season anyway, though they will 
count toward his suspension. He will not be allowed to play in the first 
64 games of the 2014 season.[4] On May 16, 2014, Tejada signed a minor 
league contract with the Miami Marlins. Tejada was required to serve the 
remaining 64 games left on his suspension before being available to be 
called up by the Marlins.[24] On August 2, Tejada was released by the Marlins.[25] 
On September 22, 2005, ESPN reported that Rafael Palmeiro, who had tested 
positive for steroids and was suspended for 10 games under Major League 
Baseball's steroid policy, implicated Tejada to baseball's arbitration 
panel, suggesting that a supplement given to him by Tejada was responsible 
for the steroid entering his system. Tejada has denied the allegations,[26] 
saying that the only thing he gave Palmeiro was vitamin B-12, a completely 
legal substance under current MLB policy. On September 24, 2005, the Baltimore 
Sun reported that "The Health Policy Advisory Committee, which oversees 
baseball's testing policy, issued a statement that exonerated Tejada and 
chastised the media for reporting that he might have distributed steroids 
to another player."[27] In José Canseco's 2005 book, Juiced: Wild Times, 
Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big, he mentions that he 
believes Tejada might have taken steroids. He claims to have spoken to 
him about them and the next season seeing him at spring training looking 
more defined. He never claims to have injected him with them, like he did 
with Palmeiro, McGwire and other ballplayers. On September 30, 2006 the 
Los Angeles Times reported that former relief pitcher Jason Grimsley, during 
a June 6, 2006 federal raid, told federal agents investigating steroids 
in baseball named Tejada as a user of "anabolic steroids." The Times reported 
that Tejada was one of five names blacked out in an affidavit filed in 
federal court.[28] However, on October 3, 2006, the Washington Post reported 
that San Francisco United States attorney Kevin Ryan said that the Los 
Angeles Times report contained "significant inaccuracies."[29] Tejada, 
along with the other four players named, has denounced the story.[29] On 
December 13, 2007, Tejada was mentioned in the Mitchell Report in connection 
to steroids. In the report, Tejada is said to have received $1,500 worth 
of steroids.[1] A report surfaced on January 15, 2008 stating that Rep. 
Henry Waxman had asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Tejada 
was truthful when speaking to the House committee when being interviewed 
in 2005 regarding possible connections to Rafael Palmeiro.[30][31] On February 
10, 2009, Tejada was charged with lying to Congress about performance-enhancing 
drug usage in Major League Baseball.[32] On February 11, Tejada pleaded 
guilty to charges that he lied to Congress in 2005.[33] He faced up to 
one year in federal prison and deportation.[34] On March 26, 2009, he received 
a one-year probation.[35] On August 17, 2013, Tejada was suspended 105 
games for testing positive twice for amphetamines, specifically the prescription 
medication adderall.[36] Tejada claimed he had medical permission from 
MLB to use the drug to treat ADD, but it expired on April 15, 2013, and 
he continued to use it without gaining a new permission from MLB.[37] The 
suspension was the third-longest non-lifetime ban issued by MLB for a drug 
violation. On April 17, 2008, Tejada was confronted by an ESPN reporter 
during a sit-down interview with documentation revealing that Tejada had 
been lying about his age ever since he first signed a Major League Baseball 
contract in 1993. Tejada had claimed to have been born in 1976 when a Dominican 
birth certificate showed that he was born in 1974 as "Miguel Tejeda."[1][2] 
He struggled to take off his microphone and kept questioning who the interviewer 
was referring to. Tejada stormed off the set, ending the interview. Before 
the interview was aired in April 22, 2008, he acknowledged this fact.[38] 
Tejada has a chicken farm in Florida where he lives with his wife, Alejandra, 
his daughter, Alexa, and his son, Miguel Jr.[39] On August 20, 2015, Reorg
