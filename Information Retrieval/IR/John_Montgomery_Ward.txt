As player As manager John Montgomery Ward (March 3, 1860 – March 4, 1925), 
known as Monte Ward, was an American Major League Baseball pitcher, shortstop 
and manager.[1][2] Ward was born in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, and grew 
up in Renovo, Pennsylvania.[3] He led the formation of the first professional 
sports players union and a new baseball league, the Players' League. Ward 
attended the Bellefonte Academy in the early 1870s and, at 13 years of 
age, he was sent to Pennsylvania State University. In his short time there, 
he helped jumpstart a baseball program and is often credited for developing 
the first curveball.[citation needed] However, he was kicked out of school 
for pushing an upperclassman who attempted to haze him down a flight of 
stairs and stealing chickens.[4] The following year, in 1874, his parents 
James and Ruth[5] died. He tried to make it as a travelling salesman, but 
when that proved unsuccessful, he returned to his hometown. It was there 
that he re-discovered baseball.[3] In 1878, the semi-pro team that he was 
playing for folded, which opened the door for him to move on to a new opportunity. 
He was offered a contract to pitch for the Providence Grays of the still 
new National League, an all professional major league that had begun its 
operations in 1876.[3] Ward's first season with the Grays was a successful 
one, going 22–13 with a 1.51 ERA. He played that season exclusively as 
a pitcher, but during the following two seasons he played increasingly 
in the outfield and at third base.[2] Ward had his two finest seasons as 
a pitcher, going 47–19 with 239 strikeouts and a 2.15 ERA in 1879 and 39–24 
with 230 strikeouts and a 1.74 ERA in 1880. He pitched nearly 600 innings 
each year (587.0 in 1879 and 595.0 in 1880).[2] As a 19-year-old pitcher, 
he won 47 games and led the 1879 Providence Grays to a first-place finish.[6] 
In 1880, he began to play other positions. On June 17, 1880, Ward pitched 
the second perfect game in baseball history, defeating future Hall of Famer 
Pud Galvin and the Buffalo Bisons, 5–0.[3] Lee Richmond had thrown baseball's 
first perfect game just five days before, on June 12. The next perfect 
game by a National League pitcher would not happen for 84 years, when Jim 
Bunning pitched a perfect game in 1964.[7] Ward also expanded his leadership 
role to include managing when he became a player-manager for the team's 
final 32 games, winning 18 of them, as the Grays finished in second place.[1][4] 
The seasons of 1881 and 1882 were the first in which he played more games 
in the outfield than he pitched. This was due to a nagging arm injury he 
originally incurred sliding into a base.[3] He still pitched well when 
he did pitch, winning 37 games over those two seasons and having ERAs of 
2.13 and 2.59 respectively,[2] and on August 17, 1882, he pitched the longest 
complete game shutout in history, blanking the Detroit Wolverines 1–0 in 
18 innings.[3] By this time, however, the Grays felt his best days were 
behind him and sold their former ace hurler to the New York Giants. Ward 
moved to the New York Gothams (renamed the Giants in 1885) in 1883. An 
injury to his right arm while running the bases during the 1884 season 
ended Ward's pitching career. As he could not wait for his arm to heal 
before he returned to the field, he taught himself to throw left-handed 
in order to play center field for the remainder of the 1884 season.[8] 
He replaced Jim Price as the Giants' manager for the final 16 games of 
the 1884 season.[8] With his arm fully recuperated, he became the everyday 
shortstop in 1885.[9] Ward graduated from Columbia Law School in 1885 and 
led the players in forming the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players, 
the first sports labor union. Ward and the players had become frustrated 
with the owners' reserve clause, which allowed them to sign players to 
one-year contracts and then not allow them to negotiate with other teams 
when those contracts expired. The players felt that the owners had absolute 
power. At first, the players had some success, gaining the freedom to negotiate 
with other teams when they were asked to take a pay cut by their current 
team.[3] In October 1887, Ward married actress Helen Dauvray.[9] In 1888, 
after the Giants had finished first in the National League,[10] and had 
won a playoff series known today as a "World Series". They played the St. 
Louis Browns of the American Association for the "Dauvray Cup", which was 
named after Ward's wife. Ward and a group of All Stars then headed off 
on a barnstorming world tour. The owners held their winter meetings, and 
created a classification system that would determine a player's salary. 
Under the system the most a player could earn was $2,500. The Giants then 
sold Ward to the Washington Nationals for a record price of $12,000. Ward 
was furious and left the tour early. He then demanded a meeting with the 
owners, and said he would refuse to play for Washington unless he received 
a large portion of his record sale price. Washington would eventually refuse 
payment on the transaction, nullifying the deal.[3] The owners denied Ward's 
request for a meeting to discuss the new classification system, saying 
there would be no talks until after the upcoming season. Though Ward and 
the union fought hard for these issues, this did not distract him or his 
Giants team as he hit .299 and helped the Giants capture their second straight 
"World Series" title in 1889.[3][11] Amidst Ward's commitments as a ballplayer 
and union organizer he still found time for a third occupation, that of 
author. His 1888 book, Base-Ball: How to Become a Player, with the Origin, 
History and Explanation of the Game was the first published effort to explore 
baseball's development from its early roots. Ward realized that negotiations 
with the owners were going nowhere and threatened to create a Players' 
League. The owners thought of it as nothing more than an idle threat but 
had failed to realize Ward's connections in the business community, and 
he began to launch the new league. This new Players' League included a 
profit sharing system for the players and had no reserve clause or classification 
plan.[3] The season began in 1890 with over half of the National League's 
players from the previous year in its ranks.[3] Ward acted as a player-manager 
for the Brooklyn club, nicknamed the Ward's Wonders, and finished seventh 
in the league with a .335 batting average.[2] While the Players' League 
drew well at the box office, the teams' owners grew nervous when the money 
did not come in as expected because of the profit sharing system. Soon 
they began holding secret meetings with their National League counterparts 
and, one by one, sold their teams to the rival league.[3] Due to an agreement 
after the dissolution of the Players' League, Ward stayed in Brooklyn as 
player-manager for the National League team, the Brooklyn Grooms. Following 
the 1892 season, Ward expressed his desire to return to the Giants and 
was sold to his former club for $6,000. Following the 1894 season, he retired 
at the age of 34. He finished his career with a .275 average, 2,104 hits, 
and 540 stolen bases. He is the only man in history to win over 100 games 
as a pitcher and collect over 2,000 hits.[3] Ward also holds the third-best 
career WHIP in major league baseball history behind only Addie Joss and 
Ed Walsh. Ward retired from baseball at age 34 in order to enter the legal 
profession. As a successful lawyer he represented baseball players against 
the National League. Later he acted as president and part-owner of the 
Boston Braves franchise and became an official in the short-lived Federal 
League in 1914, acting as the business manager of the Brooklyn Tip-Tops.[3] 
In the last quarter century of his life, Ward's sporting passion became 
golf. He won several championships around New York, played all over Europe, 
and competed regularly in the United States Golf Association U.S. Amateur, 
he finished second in the prestigious North and South Amateur Championship 
at Pinehurst Country Club in North Carolina in 1903. The North and South 
Amateur was the equal of any major golf event at the turn of the century. 
The first North and South event took place in 1901. Ever the organizer, 
he was one of the founders of the New York Golf Association and the Long 
Island Golf Association. Ward died in Augusta, Georgia, the day following 
his 65th birthday on March 4, 1925 after a bout of pneumonia,[12] and is 
interred in Greenfield Cemetery in Uniondale, Long Island, New York.[13] 
He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in
