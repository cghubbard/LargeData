The 1959 Milwaukee Braves season was the seventh season for the franchise 
in Milwaukee and its 84th season overall. The Braves ended the National 
League regular season in a first-place tie with the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
With both clubs finishing with records of 86–68, a special best-of-three 
tie-breaking series was played to decide the National League Championship 
for the World Series. The Braves lost this series to the Dodgers two games 
to none. That left the Braves record at 86–70, two games behind the Dodgers, 
who went on to win the 1959 World Series over the Chicago White Sox. Three 
days after the conclusion of the 1958 World Series, which the Braves lost 
in seven games to the New York Yankees, the club announced a reorganization 
of its front office. Team president Joseph Cairnes stepped aside, and was 
succeeded by former Cincinnati Redlegs manager Birdie Tebbetts, 46. Named 
executive vice president, and ranked just below owner Louis Perini on the 
Braves' organizational chart, Tebbetts had never before served in a front-office 
capacity in baseball.[3] The repercussions of Tebbetts' appointment to 
a senior management post were felt three months later when general manager 
John J. Quinn, 50, a member of the team's front office since 1936 (as well 
as the son of former owner J. A. Robert Quinn) and the Braves' GM since 
1945, resigned on January 14, 1959, to take the reins of the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[4] Quinn would in turn be replaced in Milwaukee by Tebbetts' 
former teammate with the Detroit Tigers, 37-year-old John McHale, GM of 
the Tigers since 1957.[5] McHale would serve as the Braves' general manager 
and, later, team president, through the club's final years in Milwaukee 
and its 1966 move to Atlanta, before his dismissal in 1966. Right fielder 
Hank Aaron won the National League batting championship with a career-high 
.355 batting average. He also led the league in hits with 223, total bases 
with 400—both also career highs—and slugging percentage at .636. Aaron 
finished third in the voting for the National League Most Valuable Player 
award. Aaron also led the Braves with 154 games played, 629 at bats, and 
123 runs batted in. Third baseman Eddie Mathews led the NL with 46 home 
runs and had a career-high 182 hits, and he led the National League. He 
also led the team with 118 runs scored, had 182 hits and drove in 114 runs. 
Mathews finished second to Ernie Banks of the Chicago Cubs in the voting 
for the league's Most Valuable Player, who hit 47 home runs and lead the 
league in runs batted in. The choice was controversial, as the Cubs finished 
in last place, but Aaron and Mathews split the voting among Braves players, 
allowing Banks to claim the award. Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette led the 
National League pitchers with 21 wins apiece, and they had identical 21–15 
win-loss records in carrying the Braves on their backs for most of the 
season. Spahn, who was the starting pitcher in the All-Star Game, pitched 
292 innings, and Burdette pitched 290. Third starter Bob Buhl returned 
from a season full of injuries to pitch 198 innings and finish with a good 
15–9 record. The star of the bullpen was relief pitcher Don McMahon, who 
pitched in 60 games (finishing 49), had a 5–3 record, a 2.57 earned run 
average, and saved 15 games. McMahon was also chosen for the All-Star Game. 
On May 26, Harvey Haddix of the Pittsburgh Pirates pitched a perfect game 
through 12 innings of a game against the Braves. Haddix retired the first 
36 consecutive batters, but lost the game 1–0 in the 13th inning.[6] Félix 
Mantilla broke up the perfect game in the 13th inning.[7] Braves pitcher 
Lew Burdette also pitched a shutout for all thirteen innings, giving up 
12 hits and no walks.[6] Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games
