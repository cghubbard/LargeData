The Seattle Mariners are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in Seattle, Washington. They play in the American League West division. 
Since the franchise entered the league as an expansion team in 1977, they 
have selected 44 players in the first round. Officially known as the "First-Year 
Player Draft",[2] the Rule 4 Draft is Major League Baseball's primary mechanism 
for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools, colleges, and 
other amateur baseball clubs to its teams. The draft order is determined 
based on the previous season's standings, with the team possessing the 
worst record receiving the first pick.[2] In addition, teams that lost 
free agents in the previous off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary 
picks.[3] The First-Year Player Draft is unrelated to the 1976 expansion 
draft through which the Mariners filled their roster. Of the 44 players 
selected in the first round by the Mariners, 17 have been pitchers, the 
most of any position; of whom 12 were right-handed, and 5 were left-handed. 
They have also drafted eight shortstops, eight outfielders, seven catchers, 
two first basemen and two third baseman.[4] Seattle has never drafted a 
second baseman in the first round.[4] The Mariners have drafted 22 players 
out of high school, and 21 out of college.[4] The Mariners have drafted 
11 players from high schools or colleges in California, four players from 
Florida, and a single player from their home state of Washington.[4] One 
of the Mariners' 2007 picks—Canadian Phillippe Aumont—is the only selection 
from outside the United States. Two of the Mariners' first-round selections—Alex 
Rodriguez and Ken Griffey, Jr.—are members of the 500 home run club.[5] 
Rodriguez has won a World Series title with the New York Yankees, four 
Hank Aaron Awards, three American League MVP awards, and has been named 
to 13 All-Star teams.[6] The Mariners have held the first overall pick 
four times, most recently in 1993.[4] The Mariners have made eight selections 
in the supplemental round of the draft and 11 compensatory picks over their 
history. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly 
valuable free agent in the previous off-season,[3][7][V] or, more recently, 
if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year.[8] The Mariners 
have failed to sign two of their picks, Scott Burrell in 1989 and John 
Mayberry, Jr. in 2002. For failing to sign these picks, the team received 
the 38th pick in the 1990 draft and the 37th pick in the 2003 draft, respectively.[9][10]
