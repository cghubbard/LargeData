Daniel Cooley Uggla (born March 11, 1980) is an American professional baseball 
second baseman who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the Florida Marlins, Atlanta Braves, San Francisco Giants and 
Washington Nationals. In 2010, Uggla won the Silver Slugger Award at second 
base. Uggla finished third in the 2006 National League Rookie of the Year 
voting, behind then-teammate and winner Hanley Ramírez, and future teammate 
Ryan Zimmerman of the Washington Nationals, but won the Players Choice 
and Sporting News NL ROY Awards. Uggla also holds other Marlins' franchise 
records. In addition, he is also the only second baseman in MLB history 
to hit at least 30 home runs in four consecutive seasons. Uggla was born 
in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Elizabeth Armistead (née Cooley) and 
John Carl Uggla.[1] After graduating from Columbia Central High School 
in Columbia, Tennessee, in 1998, Uggla attended the University of Memphis 
where he played for the Memphis Tigers. After his junior season he was 
named an All-American by Baseball America, Baseball Weekly, and Collegiate 
Baseball.[2] The surname Uggla is Swedish in origin, one of the most numerous 
Swedish noble families, and means "Owl". Drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks 
in the 11th round (338th overall) of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft, 
Uggla spent five seasons in the Diamondbacks organization, including a 
year with the short season-advanced team, the Yakima Bears in Yakima, Washington. 
He amassed a .276 career minor league batting average, .341 on-base percentage, 
and .443 slugging percentage, to go along with 64 home runs, 311 runs batted 
in, and 62 stolen bases. Although he was 25 years old, which would make 
him the same age as many AAA players, and moderately successful in 2005, 
he never advanced past the AA level. Uggla was left off the Diamondbacks 
40-man roster in 2005, and the Marlins selected him in the Rule 5 draft. 
Uggla began the 2006 season with the Marlins and had his first Major League 
hit just three days later when he singled off Houston Astros pitcher Andy 
Pettitte.[3] His first home run was on April 13 against San Diego Padres 
starter Dewon Brazelton,[4] and his first stolen base was a steal of home 
plate against the Philadelphia Phillies on April 21.[5] Uggla was named 
to the 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game on July 2, 2006, as a reserve; 
he is the first player in baseball history to be selected for the All-Star 
Game in the same season in which he had been a Rule 5 pick.[6] On September 
15, 2006, Uggla hit his 25th home run, breaking Joe Gordon's record for 
most home runs by a rookie second baseman. Because he received less publicity 
as a prospect than some of his fellow rookies in Major League Baseball, 
such as Prince Fielder, Ryan Zimmerman, and Nick Markakis, Uggla's display 
of power in the majors and his selection to the National League All-Star 
team caused him to suddenly draw more attention.[7] Uggla finished his 
rookie season with 27 homers and 90 runs batted in. He won numerous rookie 
awards, including the Players' Choice NL ROY award[8] and Sporting News 
Rookie of the Year Award.[9] The Marlins finished Uggla's second season 
in last place. Uggla finished the year with a .245 batting average, caused 
mainly by slumps in April and September.[10] However, he did surpass his 
rookie home run total, hitting 31 home runs and knocking in 88 runs.[11] 
On May 10, 2008, Uggla hit his first career grand slam in the fourth inning 
off of Nationals pitcher Joel Hanrahan.[12] That month, he set a Marlins 
record for most home runs for a Marlins in any month with 12.[13] Uggla 
was named to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, as well as opting 
to take part in the 2008 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby. Uggla hit 
six home runs in the first round of the derby. Uggla finished fifth, tied 
with Grady Sizemore. In the All-Star Game, Uggla committed two consecutive 
errors on playable balls in the 10th inning, and a third error in the bottom 
of the 13th, making him the first player with three errors in a single 
All-Star Game.[14][15] Uggla also struck out three times, and grounded 
into a double play.[16] On September 28, 2008, Uggla hit the last home 
run ever at Shea Stadium.[17] During the 2008 offseason, Uggla went to 
arbitration with the Marlins and was awarded $5.35 million; the Marlins 
had offered him $4.4 million.[18][19] On June 5, 2009, Uggla reached 100 
career home runs in his 502nd game, faster than any other second baseman.[20] 
On January 18, 2010, Uggla signed a one-year, $7.8 million contract with 
the Marlins.[19][21] He hit his 144th career home run on July 31, setting 
the Marlins all-time career mark.[22] On September 13, 2010, he became 
the first second baseman in Major League history to hit 30 or more home 
runs in four seasons.[23] After the 2010 season, Uggla rejected a four-year, 
$48 million contract offer from the Marlins.[24] Soon thereafter, Uggla 
was traded to the Atlanta Braves for infielder Omar Infante, and reliever 
Michael Dunn.[25] On January 4, 2011, Uggla and the Atlanta Braves agreed 
to a 5-year, $62 million contract.[26] During the 2011 season with the 
Braves, Uggla became the 23rd player in MLB history to have a hitting streak 
of at least 33 games. Uggla, who had gotten off to a poor start, had a 
.173 batting average after going hitless on July 4. The next day, he collected 
two hits in four at bats to start the streak.[27] During the hitting streak, 
Uggla along with rookie Freddie Freeman became the first Braves in the 
modern era to have concurrent 20-game hitting streaks.[28] On August 12, 
Uggla hit two home runs in a home game against the Chicago Cubs to break 
the Atlanta Braves record for longest hitting streak, which had been set 
by Rico Carty in 1970.[29] He also hit a single and a home run in the next 
game, extending the streak to 33 games.[30] The streak ended on August 
14, 2011, after he went 0-for-3 with a sacrifice fly against the Chicago 
Cubs. After the first few weeks, he raised his average over .200. Uggla 
hit .377 with 15 homers and 32 RBIs during his streak, which was the third-longest 
by a second baseman in Major League history,[31] and the longest in the 
majors since 2006.[32] On August 22, 2011, Uggla hit his 30th home run 
of the season for his fifth consecutive season of 30 or more home runs. 
As of the 2011 season, he is the only second baseman to have hit 30 or 
more home runs in more than three seasons.[33] Uggla was named National 
League Player of the Month for August; for the month, he was tied for the 
Major League and led all National Leaguers with 10 home runs. He also had 
21 RBI, 33 hits, a .340 (33-for-97) batting average and a .670 slugging 
percentage with a .405 on-base percentage.[34] In 2011, Uggla hit a career 
high 36 HR.[35] On defense, he tied for the Major League lead in errors 
by a second baseman, with 15.[36] In 2012, Uggla performed poorly, with 
a batting average below .220 through 92 games. His power production was 
also down, as he hit 12 HRs through 93 games. He also struck out at a rate 
higher than his previous seasons. His fielding percentage of .980 was equivalent 
to his poor career fielding percentage. He also, however, drew walks at 
the highest rate of his career.[citation needed] This actually put his 
on-base percentage for the 2012 regular season at .348, tied for third 
best among second basemen with Marco Scutaro of the Giants, behind only 
Robinson Canó of the Yankees and Aaron Hill of the Diamondbacks. 2013 proved 
to be a difficult season for Uggla. With 80 hits in 443 plate appearances, 
Uggla tied Rob Deer for the lowest season batting average for a player 
qualifying for the batting title. On October 1, the Braves announced they 
would leave Uggla off the 25-man roster during the playoffs. Uggla had 
an average beginning to his 2014 season, hitting .237 through his first 
16 games, but he really cooled off and hit .114 over his next 12 games, 
leading the Braves to consider other options at second base.[37] He lost 
the starting job on May 8 to Ramiro Peña and Tyler Pastornicky, and eventually 
to Tommy La Stella by the end of May.[38] He was released on July 18, 2014. 
The Atlanta Braves continued to pay Uggla $19 million through the 2015 
season.[39] On July 21, 2014, Uggla signed a minor league contract with 
the San Francisco Giants[40][41] and was called up four days later.[42] 
He played in four games for the Giants, hitting 0 for 11 and committing 
three fielding errors.[43] He was designated for assignment on August 1,[44] 
but rejected his assignment and three days later became a free agent.[45] 
Despite only playing four major league games for the Giants, Uggla received 
a World Series ring after only being a member of the 2014 championship 
team for that short period.[46] On December 26, 2014, Uggla signed a minor 
league contract with the Washington Nationals, that included an invitation 
to spring training.[47][48] He made the opening day roster as second baseman.[49] 
While Uggla was not a regular fixture in the Nationals' starting lineup,[50] 
he played a key role in a come-from-behind victory over the Atlanta Braves, 
his former team, on April 28, 2015. He tripled to drive in two runs and 
then hit a three-run home run in the ninth to put the Nationals ahead for 
good.[51] Uggla's last game was October 3, 2015, in which Max Scherzer 
no-hit the New York Mets in a 2-0 win. Uggla homered in his final at-bat.[52] 
The Nationals did not renew Uggla's contract at the end of the year and 
he subsequently became a free agent. Uggla married Janette Repsch in December 
2013. They have a daughter together.[53] He has two children from a previous
