The San Francisco Giants are a Major League Baseball franchise based in 
San Francisco, California. They moved to San Francisco from New York City 
in 1958.[1] They play in the National League West division. The first game 
of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being 
named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the 
player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season,[2] though 
there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not 
start on Opening Day.[3] Through 2016, the Giants have used 30 different 
Opening Day starting pitchers in their 58 seasons since moving to San Francisco. 
The 30 starters have a combined Opening Day record of 27 wins, 16 losses 
and 16 no decisions.[4] No decisions are only awarded to the starting pitcher 
if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game.[5] 
The first Opening Day game for the San Francisco Giants was played against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 15, 1958 at Seals Stadium, the Giants' 
first home ball park in San Francisco.[6] Rubén Gómez was the Giants' Opening 
Day starting pitcher that day, in a game the Giants lost 8–0.[6] That was 
the Giants' only Opening Day game at Seals Stadium. They also played in 
two other home parks in San Francisco: Candlestick Park from 1960 to 1999, 
and AT&T Park, previously called PacBell Park and SBC Park, since 2000.[7] 
The Giants' Opening Day starting pitchers had a record of seven wins, three losses 
and seven no decisions at Candlestick Park and have a record of two wins, 
one loss and one no decision at AT&T Park. That gives the San Francisco 
Giants' Opening Day starting pitchers a total home record of 10 wins, 4 losses 
and 8 no decisions. Their record in Opening Day road games is 17 wins, 
12 losses, and 8 no decisions.[4] Juan Marichal holds the San Francisco 
Giants' record for most Opening Day starts, with 10.[4] Marichal had a 
record in Opening Day starts of six wins, two losses and two no decisions. 
Tim Lincecum made four Opening Day starts for the Giants, and John Montefusco, 
Mike Krukow, John Burkett and Liván Hernández each made three Opening Day 
starts. Sam Jones, Vida Blue, Rick Reuschel, Mark Gardner, Kirk Rueter, 
Jason Schmidt and Barry Zito have each made two Opening Day starts for 
the Giants.[4][8][9] Marichal has the most wins in Opening Day starts for 
San Francisco, with six. Reuschel and Burkett are the only pitchers to 
have won more than one Opening Day start for San Francisco without a loss. 
Both have records in Opening Day starts of two wins and no losses. Burkett 
also has a no decision. Zito has the worst record for San Francisco in 
Opening Day starts, with no wins and two losses. Zito and Marichal have 
the most losses in Opening Day starts, with two apiece.[4] The Giants have 
played in the World Series six times since moving to San Francisco, in 
1962, 1989, 2002, 2010, 2012 and 2014, winning in 2010, 2012 and 2014.[10] 
Their Opening Day starting pitchers in those years were Juan Marichal in 
1962, Rick Reuschel in 1989, Liván Hernández in 2002, Tim Lincecum in 2010 
and 2012, and Madison Bumgarner in 2014.[4] The Giants' Opening Day starting 
pitchers won four of their six Opening Day starts in those seasons, with 
their only loss coming in 2012 and a no decision in 2014.[4] "San Francisco
