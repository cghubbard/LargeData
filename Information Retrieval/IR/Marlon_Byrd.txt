Marlon Jerrard Byrd (born August 30, 1977) is an American professional 
baseball outfielder who is currently a free agent. He previously played 
for the Philadelphia Phillies, Washington Nationals, Texas Rangers, Chicago 
Cubs, Boston Red Sox, New York Mets, Pittsburgh Pirates, San Francisco 
Giants, Cincinnati Reds and Cleveland Indians. While primarily a first 
baseman earlier in his career, Byrd has since transitioned to being a corner 
outfielder. He has been suspended twice for using performance-enhancing 
drugs. Byrd is a 1995 graduate of Sprayberry High School in Marietta, Georgia, 
and won All-State honors in baseball and football. He played on the 1993 
state runner-up team as a sophomore, and was part of the 1995 state championship 
team.[citation needed] Byrd played baseball at Georgia Tech. After a major 
injury, he transferred to Georgia Perimeter Junior College where he earned 
an AS Degree in Business in May 1999, while rededicating himself to baseball. 
The injury was to his right leg in which he sustained muscular damage and 
an infection which cut off the circulation to his nerves. He had to undergo 
three operations to correct the problem. Many doctors had wanted to amputate 
his right leg, but Byrd refused and underwent a two-year rehab process. 
During the rehab process, Byrd reached up to 300 pounds.[1] Byrd reached 
the big leagues in 2003. He came in fourth in the Rookie of the Year voting, 
batting .303 with 86 runs scored, 28 doubles, four triples, seven home 
runs and 11 stolen bases in 135 games and 495 at-bats. In 2004, he did 
not keep his high level of performance. Byrd was traded to the Washington 
Nationals in 2005 for Endy Chávez. On July 15, 2006, Byrd was designated 
for assignment and assigned to Washington's Triple-A affiliate, the New 
Orleans Zephyrs. Byrd was signed as a free agent by the Rangers on December 
8, 2006, to compete for the starting position in center field.[2] After 
failing to make the Rangers' major league roster out of spring training, 
Byrd was assigned to the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks. Byrd's contract was 
purchased on May 26, 2007, following injuries to outfielders Brad Wilkerson 
and Jerry Hairston, Jr.[3] Making the most of his call-up by hitting over 
.400 for the month of June,[4] Byrd played his way into the line-up, allowing 
the Rangers to trade center fielder Kenny Lofton prior to the trading deadline. 
On August 4, 2008, he hit a walk-off grand slam to help the Rangers beat 
the Yankees 9–5. Byrd had a career season in 2009, hitting 20 home runs 
and collecting 89 RBIs. Following the 2009 season, Byrd filed for free 
agency, declining the Rangers' offer of salary arbitration.[5] On December 
31, 2009, Byrd signed a three-year, $15 million contract with the Chicago 
Cubs.[6] In his first season with the Cubs, Byrd had his best season. He 
was selected for his first All-Star Game. Byrd entered the game as a substitute 
and drew a walk off of Matt Thornton. He scored from first base on a double 
by Brian McCann. In the ninth inning, while playing right field, Byrd made 
an outstanding play, forcing Boston DH David Ortiz at second after fielding 
what normally would have been a base hit. On May 21, 2011, while batting 
during the 2nd inning of a game against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, 
Byrd was hit near his left eye by a pitch from Red Sox pitcher Alfredo 
Aceves. The pitch was, according to Aceves, unintentional. After the pitch 
hit him, Byrd dropped to the ground, covered the area by his left eye and 
rolled in pain; he was helped off the field by Cubs medical personnel and 
taken to the trainer's room in the clubhouse. Byrd did not return to the 
game. He was taken to Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary at Massachusetts 
General Hospital in Boston, where he stayed overnight to be examined. The 
incident marked the fifth time that Byrd had been hit by a pitch in a ten-day 
period.[7] Byrd was placed on the 15-day disabled list the following day. 
Justin Berg was called up to take his place.[8] After coming off his stint 
on the disabled list, Byrd wore a protective mask customized to his helmet 
in order to shield his weakened facial bones. After the 2011 season Byrd 
began practicing Muay Thai and started a new diet and lost 40 lbs.[9] On 
April 21, 2012 Byrd was traded to the Boston Red Sox for Michael Bowden 
and a player to be named later.[10] Minor league pitcher Hunter Cervenka 
was the player sent to the Cubs May 15. On June 9, 2012, Byrd was designated 
for assignment by the Red Sox in order to make room for Daisuke Matsuzaka, 
who was returning from the disabled list. On June 12, 2012 Byrd was released. 
On June 25, 2012, Byrd was suspended 50 games for testing positive for 
a banned substance.[11] Byrd was placed on the restricted list and remained 
there until August 20. On February 1, 2013, Byrd signed a minor-league 
deal with the Mets.[12] Byrd hit a walk-off 2 RBI single on April 7 for 
the Mets on their way to a 4-3 victory over the Miami Marlins. Before a 
game on June 5, 2013, Byrd joked with Mets teammate Anthony Recker that 
he was going to hit two home runs in the game. Byrd did hit two home runs 
in the Mets 10-1 win over the Washington Nationals. Byrd hit .285 with 
21 home runs and 71 RBI in 117 games for the Mets before being traded to 
the Pittsburgh Pirates.[citation needed] On August 27, 2013, Byrd and John 
Buck were traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for infield prospect 
Dilson Herrera and a player to be named later,[13] identified on August 
29 as Vic Black.[14][15] In his first game with the Pirates, Byrd hit a 
3-run home run in Pittsburgh's 7-1 victory over Milwaukee. In the 2013 
National League Wild Card Game, Byrd went 2-4 with a home run and 2 RBI, 
as the Pirates defeated the Cincinnati Reds 6-2.[16] On November 12, 2013, 
Byrd agreed in principle to a two-year contract worth $16 million to return 
to the Phillies. The deal included an $8 million club option for 2016 that 
vests based on plate appearances.[17] Unlike his previous years, Byrd began 
to strike out more often. In 154 games of 2014, Byrd struck out 185 times 
while batting .264 with 25 home runs and 85 RBI. On December 31, 2014, 
Byrd was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for starting pitcher Ben Lively. 
As of May 14, 2015 Byrd was hitting .342 with six home runs and 14 RBIs 
in the month of May.[18] He reached 19 home runs before being traded to 
the San Francisco Giants. On August 20, 2015, Byrd was traded to the San 
Francisco Giants for Double-A reliever Stephen Johnson. He hit a home run 
on his first at-bat with the Giants on August 21, 2015 against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates.[19] Byrd hit the Giants' record-breaking 8th grand slam of the 
season against the Cardinals on August 28, 2015 against Michael Wacha. 
This was Byrd's first career hit against Wacha, and it was Wacha's first 
grand-slam given up. After becoming a free agent following the 2015 season, 
Byrd signed a minor-league contract with the Cleveland Indians on March 
18, 2016 with an invitation to major-league spring training camp.[20] The 
Indians purchased his contract and added him to the active roster on April 
3, 2016.[21] On June 1, 2016, Byrd was suspended 162 games for his second 
positive PED test. The day his suspension started, he told his teammates
