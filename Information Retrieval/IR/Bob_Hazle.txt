Robert Sydney "Hurricane" Hazle (December 9, 1930 – April 25, 1992) was 
an American professional baseball player. He was an outfielder over parts 
of three Major League seasons (1955; 1957–1958) with the Cincinnati Redlegs, 
Milwaukee Braves and Detroit Tigers. Hazle was a member of the 1957 World 
Series champion Braves. For his Major League career, he hit .310 with 9 
home runs and 37 runs batted in in 110 games played. Hazle was born in 
Laurens, South Carolina. He batted left-handed, threw right-handed, and 
was listed as 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and 190 pounds (86 kg). He attended Wofford 
College and signed with Cincinnati in 1950. Hazle debuted with the Redlegs 
late in the 1955 season, but made no impression. He then was traded with 
Corky Valentine to the Milwaukee Braves in return for George Crowe the 
following spring, but did not appear in the big leagues. Playing for the 
Triple-A Wichita Braves, he was hurt and reportedly considered quitting 
the sport. Hazle is best remembered for his meteoric 1957 performance. 
He was promoted from Wichita only after outfielder Bill Bruton suffered 
a season-ending knee injury, and did not play until the Braves' 100th game. 
In less than three weeks, from August 9 through August 25, Hazle batted 
.473 with 5 home runs and 19 RBI in 14 games, a sudden burst of unexpected 
offense that earned him the nickname "Hurricane." The original Hurricane 
Hazel had struck the coast of Hazle's home state, South Carolina, in 1954. 
The first-place Braves swept the second-place Cardinals on August 9–11, 
which went a long way towards sealing the National League pennant for Milwaukee; 
the first two games of the series were blowouts, and Hazle had seven hits 
and five RBI. He batted a torrid .556 in his first dozen games. For the 
season, Hazle batted .403 in 41 games, with 7 home runs and 27 RBI. On 
the next-to-last day of the season, Hazle broke up a no-hit bid by Cincinnati's 
Johnny Klippstein with a two-out, eighth-inning single. Hazle appeared 
in four of seven World Series games that year, hitting an ineffective .154 
for the champion Braves. However, both of his Series hits came in the seventh 
and deciding game; Hazle scored the first run in a 5–0 victory. Despite 
having had just 134 at-bats, Hazle finished fourth in the 1957 NL Rookie 
of the Year voting. After a bad start in 1958, he was traded to Detroit. 
After a stint in the minors, he retired in 1960. Hazle died in Columbia,
