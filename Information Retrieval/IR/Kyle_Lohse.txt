Kyle Matthew Lohse (/ˈloʊʃ/; born October 4, 1978) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher who is currently a free agent . He previously played for 
the Minnesota Twins, Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis 
Cardinals , Milwaukee Brewers, and Texas Rangers (baseball) Lohse is a 
member of the Nomlaki tribe. As of 2014, he was one of only three active 
non-Hispanic Native American players in MLB, with the others being Joba 
Chamberlain of the Cleveland Indians and Jacoby Ellsbury of the New York 
Yankees.[1] On June 26, 2015, Lohse became the 14th pitcher to defeat all 
30 MLB teams.[2] Kyle was raised in Ord Bend, California, and attended 
nearby Hamilton Union High School in Hamilton City, California. Lohse followed 
in the footsteps of his parents, Larry and Leslie, who were both star athletes 
when they attended the same high school in the 1970s. He played basketball, 
baseball, and football. While playing baseball, he was an All-Conference 
pick in all four years of high school. He was also on the Honor Roll and 
took several advanced classes. He graduated in 1996. Lohse's mother has 
Native American and Filipino ancestry and his father has German ancestry. 
Growing up, Lohse did not think of himself as anything other than "American" 
because the Nomlaki tribe did not reestablish itself until 1996.[3] After 
high school, Lohse attended Butte College. The Chicago Cubs selected Lohse 
in the 29th round of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft. In 1999, the 
Cubs traded Lohse with Jason Ryan to the Minnesota Twins for Rick Aguilera 
and Scott Downs. Lohse made his MLB debut with the Twins on June 22, 2001. 
In 2002, Lohse's first full year as a starter, he posted a 13–8 record 
with an ERA of 4.23. He followed that with success in 2003, starting 33 
games and going 14–11 with a 4.61 ERA. In 2004, he did not fare as well, 
going 9–13 with a 5.34 ERA. Lohse has been to one ALCS, with the Twins 
in 2002. On May 17, 2006, he was sent down to AAA Rochester, and the Twins 
called up replacement pitcher Boof Bonser. On June 9, Matt Guerrier broke 
his thumb and Lohse was recalled. On July 31, 2006, Lohse was traded to 
the Cincinnati Reds for minor-league pitcher Zach Ward. Lohse made his 
first start for the Reds on August 17, 2006. On July 30, 2007, Lohse was 
traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for minor-league pitcher Matt Maloney. 
After his departure from the Reds, Lohse's performance dropped off slightly, 
and in 11 starts with the Phillies, Lohse went 3–0, receiving a large number 
of no-decisions due to late offensive rallies by the Phillies lineup. His 
ERA for the Phillies swelled to 4.72,[4] and he averaged fewer than six 
innings pitched per start. On March 14, 2008, Lohse signed a one-year deal 
with the St. Louis Cardinals[5] worth $4.25 million.[6] Lohse was one of 
the biggest surprises for the Cardinals in the first half of the 2008 season, 
going 11–2 with a 3.39 ERA. He was later suspended for five games for throwing 
at Reds' pitcher Edinson Vólquez. Lohse appealed the ruling and pitched 
as he awaited a decision on his appeal, but Lohse eventually dropped his 
appeal and served his suspension in full. Lohse and the Cardinals agreed 
to a four-year, $41-million contract extension on September 29, 2008.[7] 
On April 17, 2010, in a 20-inning game against the New York Mets, Lohse 
entered the game playing left field in the 18th inning while shortstop 
Felipe López pitched. On August 28, 2011, Lohse won his 100th game as a 
pitcher when the Cardinals defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 7–4. That year, 
he led the Cardinals with 14 wins and a 3.39 ERA.[8] Lohse was named the 
Cardinals' Opening Day starting pitcher in 2012.[8] In that game, Lohse 
did not give up a hit until the seventh inning, when José Reyes hit a single 
to right field. In total, Lohse threw 7 1⁄3 innings, giving up two hits 
while allowing one run and striking out three. Thus, Lohse became the first 
pitcher to earn a win at the new Marlins Park.[9] His 16-3 won-lost record 
for 2012 led the National League in winning percentage, at .842, among 
eligible pitchers.[10] On March 25, 2013, it was confirmed that Kyle Lohse 
signed a three-year, $33 million contract with the Milwaukee Brewers.[11] 
Despite moving to one of the most hitter-friendly parks in Miller Park 
to pitch with Milwaukee, Lohse continued to pitch well. In his first season 
with the Brewers, Lohse went 11-10 with a 3.35 ERA over the course of 198 
innings pitched. In 2014 Lohse pitched to a 3.54 ERA over the course of 
31 starts and 198 and third innings pitched for the Milwaukee Brewers and 
struck out 141 batters, only two short of his career high.[12] On May 13, 
2016, Lohse signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers worth $2 
million, with another $1.5 million in performance bonuses.[13] After two 
rough starts in which he allowed more than 10 runs, he was designated for 
assignment. Lohse refused his outright assignment and became a free agent 
on July 31st. Lohse's arsenal features a two-seam fastball at 90-91 mph, 
a biting slider in the mid 80s, a downward-fading changeup in the low 80s, 
and a 12-6 curveball in the low-to-mid 70s. His slider is thrown harder 
than normal for a pitcher with his velocity and has a very tight break 
at the end, making it something of a hybrid between a cutter and a slider. 
At the beginning of his career, and until he began pitching with the Cardinals, 
his primary fastball was a normal four-seam fastball in the low 90s. After 
signing with St. Louis and under the tutelage of Dave Duncan, Lohse started 
using a two-seamer, a major reason for his development. Developing his 
two-seamer and refining his off-speed pitches, Lohse has become known as 
a very good command pitcher capable of inducing many ground-ball outs without 
walking many batters. He is not a major strikeout pitcher, but in 2012 
set a new career high in strikeouts with 143 in 211 innings, giving him 
6.1 strikeouts per nine innings, with only 1.6 walks. During his career 
in Minnesota, Lohse dedicated himself to working with Cars for Courage, 
an organization that serves disabled children through sports programs and
