Richard Francis Donnelly (born August 5, 1946, at Steubenville, Ohio) is 
an American professional baseball coach. On March 7, 2014, he was named 
third-base coach of the Seattle Mariners, replacing John Stearns.[1] He 
served in the post for two seasons, through 2015, before his release on 
October 9, 2015.[2] Donnelly was a Major League Baseball (MLB) coach for 
over 25 years, and was a catcher during his active career in minor league 
baseball. Donnelly had been slated to spend 2014 as manager of the Tacoma 
Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League, the Mariners' Triple-A affiliate.[3] 
However, Stearns underwent hiatal hernia surgery prior to spring training 
on February 24, and his slower-than-expected recovery caused him to step 
down to a professional scouting post with the Mariners.[1] Donnelly was 
then named to take his place on the staff of skipper Lloyd McClendon, whose 
playing tenure with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1990–1994) coincided with Donnelly's 
service on Jim Leyland's coaching staff. Prior to joining the Mariners' 
organization in 2014, Donnelly spent three seasons (2011–2013) as skipper 
of the Brooklyn Cyclones of the New York–Penn League, Short Season-A farm 
club of the New York Mets. Donnelly graduated from Steubenville Catholic 
Central High School in Ohio where he played baseball and basketball. He 
attended college at Xavier University. Donnelly was signed as a catcher 
by the Minnesota Twins in 1967 and played four seasons in the Twins' and 
Washington Senators' minor league systems, compiling a .224 career batting 
average with two home runs and 73 runs batted in in 313 games played.[4] 
Donnelly managed in the Texas Rangers farm system from 1972 to 1979 and 
1981 to 1982. He was honored as the Western Carolinas League Manager of 
the Year from 1972 to 1974. He led the Class A Gastonia Rangers to the 
league title in 1974. He managed the Rangers Class AAA affiliate from 1976 
to 1979 and 1981 to 1982. Donnelly was the bullpen coach for the Texas 
Rangers in 1980. He served as the first base coach for the Rangers from 
1983–1985. Donnelly spent 14 seasons on Jim Leyland's staff with three 
organizations—Pittsburgh (1986–1996), Florida (1997–1998) and Colorado 
(1999). He earned a World Series ring with Florida in 1997. He remained 
with the Rockies through 2002. He was a third base coach for the Milwaukee 
Brewers from 2003 to 2005 and for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2006 and 2007, 
then worked in player development for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 2008 
to 2010. From 2011 to 2013, Donnelly was the manager of the short-season 
Class A Brooklyn Cyclones. He was named manager of the Class AAA Tacoma 
Rainiers on January 16, 2014.[3] He became the Seattle Mariners third base 
coach on March 7, 2014.[5] Donnelly also is rated in the top ten racquetball 
players over 50 in the United States.[citation needed] Perhaps the best 
known story of Donnelly is his experience coaching the Florida Marlins 
in the 1997 World Series. His 17-year-old daughter, Amy, died of a brain 
tumor in 1993. Amy attended a 1992 playoff game in which Rich was coaching. 
She noticed that he would cup his hands over his mouth while yelling out 
instructions to runners on second base. After the game, she asked, "Dad, 
what are you telling them? That the chicken runs at midnight, or what?" 
Since her death, the Donnelly family would deem that as her catchphrase 
and serve inspiration for the family. In 1997, as a member of the Florida 
Marlins, he met Craig Counsell, a player his son Tim nicknamed "Chicken 
Wing" because of his unique batting stance. In the 11th inning of Game 
7, Counsell reached base and was able to advance to third base as the inning 
progressed. Edgar Rentería then hit a single on which Counsell scored, 
winning the World Series for the Marlins. Rich's sons Tim and Mike, who 
were honorary bat boys that evening, rushed to their father in celebration. 
Tim pointed out to the stadium clock which read 12:00 midnight, telling 
his father, "The chicken ran at midnight, dad." Donnelly believes that 
Amy was sending him a message from Heaven, and this experience has strengthened 
his faith in God.[6][7] This story was featured on the documentary "Champions
