Joseph Walter Hoerner (November 12, 1936 – October 4, 1996) was a Major 
League Baseball relief pitcher. A native of Dubuque, Iowa, the left-hander 
was signed by the Chicago White Sox as an amateur free agent before the 
1957 season. He played for the Houston Colt .45s (1963–1964), St. Louis 
Cardinals (1966–1969), Philadelphia Phillies (1970–72, 1975), Atlanta Braves 
(1972–1973), Kansas City Royals (1973–1974), Texas Rangers (1976), and 
Cincinnati Reds (1977). Hoerner was used exclusively in relief during his 
14-year MLB career. He appeared in 493 games, and during his first six 
full seasons (1966–1971) had one of the lowest combined ERAs among all 
major league relief pitchers (2.16). Hoerner was drafted by the Colt .45's 
from the White Sox in the 1961 minor league draft. He made his major league 
debut on September 27, 1963 against the New York Mets at Colt Stadium. 
In this particular game Houston manager Harry Craft used a starting lineup 
of nine rookies, including Jerry Grote (20), Joe Morgan (20), Rusty Staub 
(19), and Jimmy Wynn (21). Hoerner pitched three scoreless innings as the 
Mets won, 10–3.[1] He was drafted by the Cardinals from the Houston Astros 
in the 1965 rule V draft, and this led to him being part of two pennant-winning 
teams, including the 1967 World Series champions. In game 3 of the 1968 
World Series he became the first player in MLB history to get a hit in 
a World Series without having collected a hit in the regular season. In 
four seasons with St. Louis (1966–1969) Hoerner pitched in 206 games with 
a 19–10 record and 60 saves. He ranked in the National League top ten all 
four seasons for saves, and three times for games finished. On July 22, 
1966 at Wrigley Field he hit his only major league home run, a 3-run shot, 
against Hall of Famer Ferguson Jenkins. During this time he also tied a 
National League record for relievers with 6 consecutive strikeouts vs. 
the Mets on June 1, 1968[2] He also appeared in five World Series games 
for the Cards, with a 0–1 record and one save. Hoerner was traded to Philadelphia 
as part of the infamous Curt Flood deal[3] on October 7, 1969. He made 
the National League All-Star team in 1970, and his .643 winning percentage 
ranked sixth in the league. During 1971 that year he gave up Willie Mays' 
major league-leading 22nd and last career extra-inning home run at Candlestick 
Park. In 1971, at age 34, he finished the year with a 1.97 ERA, and his 
effectiveness declined after that season. However, he later gave up Willie 
McCovey's N.L. record-breaking 17th grand slam in 1977 at Riverfront Stadium. 
His final major league appearance was on August 5, 1977. At the age of 
40, he was the second-oldest player to appear in a National League game 
that season. For his career he finished with a lifetime record of 39–34, 
99 saves, 268 games finished, and an earned run average of 2.99. He struck 
out 412 and walked 181 In 562.2 innings pitched. Hoerner held All-Stars 
Bobby Bonds, Johnny Callison, Tommy Harper, Ed Kranepool, Joe Pepitone, 
and Bill White to a .070 collective batting average (5-for-71). He also 
held Hall of Famers Hank Aaron, Ernie Banks, Reggie Jackson, Willie Mays, 
Bill Mazeroski, Tony Pérez, Willie Stargell, and Carl Yastrzemski to a 
.101 collective batting average (9-for-89). Hoerner died in a farming accident
