Edison is a township in Middlesex County, New Jersey, United States, in 
the New York City metropolitan area, and the Raritan Bayshore subregion 
of the Jersey Shore. As of the 2010 United States Census, Edison had a 
total population of 99,967,[10][11][12] retaining its position as the fifth-most 
populous municipality in New Jersey.[21] The 2010 population reflected 
an increase of 2,280 (+2.3%) from the 97,687 counted in the 2000 Census, 
which had in turn increased by 9,007 (+10.2%) from the 88,680 counted in 
1990.[22] Edison's population has been above the 100,000 threshold since 
2010, increasing by 2.7% to a Census-estimated 102,701 in 2015.[13] What 
is now Edison Township was originally incorporated as Raritan Township 
by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 17, 1870, from portions 
of both Piscataway Township and Woodbridge Township. Portions of the township 
were taken to form Metuchen on March 20, 1900, and Highland Park on March 
15, 1905. The name was officially changed to Edison Township on November 
10, 1954, in honor of inventor Thomas Edison, who had his main laboratory 
in the Menlo Park section of the township.[23] Edison was ranked the 28th 
most-livable small city in the United States by CNN Money Magazine, and 
second in New Jersey in 2006 in Money Magazine's "Best Places To Live".[24] 
In 2008, two years later, Money Magazine ranked the township 35th out of 
the top 100 places to live in the United States.[25] In the 2006 survey 
of America's Safest Cities, the township was ranked 23rd, out of 371 cities 
included nationwide, in the 13th annual Morgan Quitno survey.[26] In 2009, 
Edison was ranked as one of "America's 10 Best Places to Grow Up" by U.S. 
News & World Report. The rankings focused on low crime, strong schools, 
green spaces, and abundance of recreational activities.[27] Edison Township, 
comprising former sections of Piscataway and Woodbridge townships, was 
settled (by Europeans) in the 17th century. The earliest village was Piscatawaytown, 
which is centered around St. James Church and the Piscatawaytown Common, 
near the intersection of Plainfield and Woodbridge avenues in south Edison.[28] 
The Laing House of Plainfield Plantation, the Benjamin Shotwell House, 
and the Homestead Farm at Oak Ridge, are buildings from the colonial era 
included in National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex 
County.[29] The community was previously known as "Raritan Township", not 
to be confused with the current-day Raritan Township in Hunterdon County.[23] 
In 1876, Thomas Edison set up his home and research laboratory in New Jersey 
on the site of an unsuccessful real estate development in Raritan Township 
called "Menlo Park", (currently located in Edison State Park). While there 
he earned the nickname "the Wizard of Menlo Park." Before his death at 
age 83 in 1931, the prolific inventor amassed a record 1,093 patents for 
creations including the phonograph, a stock ticker, the motion-picture 
camera, the incandescent light bulb, a mechanical vote counter, the alkaline 
storage battery including one for an electric car, and the first commercial 
electric light.[30] It was in his Menlo Park laboratory that Thomas Edison 
came up with the phonograph and a commercially viable incandescent light 
bulb filament. Christie Street was the first street in the world to use 
electric lights for illumination.[31] Edison subsequently left Menlo Park 
and moved his home and laboratory to West Orange in 1886.[32] His Menlo 
Park lab has been called one of the greatest laboratories ever.[33] Near 
Piscatawaytown village, a portion of the Township was informally known 
as "Nixon," after Lewis Nixon, a manufacturer and community leader. Soon 
after the outbreak of World War I, Nixon established a massive volatile 
chemicals processing facility there, known as the Nixon Nitration Works. 
It was the site of the 1924 Nixon Nitration Works disaster, a massive explosion 
and resulting fire that killed 20 persons and destroyed several square 
miles of the Township.[34] In 1954, the township's name was changed to 
honor inventor Thomas A. Edison.[23][35] Also on the ballot in 1954 was 
a failed proposal to change the community's name to Nixon.[36] Edison has 
been one of the fastest-growing municipalities in New Jersey. As of the 
2000 United States Census, it was the fifth most-populated municipality 
in the state, after the cities of Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Elizabeth. 
Edison is primarily a middle-class community with more than 75 ethnic communities 
represented. Edison has a large Jewish community next to Highland Park, 
with multiple synagogues located in Edison. Edison also has a growing Indian 
community and a number of temples serving the religious needs of the community. 
Reflecting the number of Edison's residents from India and China, the township 
has sister city arrangements with Shijiazhuang, China,[37] and Vadodara, 
India.[38] According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had 
a total area of 30.638 square miles (79.351 km2), including 29.940 square 
miles (77.543 km2) of land and 0.698 square miles (1.808 km2) of water 
(2.28%).[2][3] Edison is on the east side of Raritan Valley (a line of 
communities in central New Jersey), along with Plainfield, and completely 
surrounds the borough of Metuchen, New Jersey. The township borders East 
Brunswick Township, Highland Park, New Brunswick, Piscataway Township, 
Sayreville, South Plainfield and Woodbridge Township in Middlesex County; 
Clark, Plainfield and Scotch Plains in Union County.[39] Unincorporated 
communities, localities and place names located partially or completely 
within the township include Bonhamtown, Camp Kilmer, Centerville, Clara 
Barton, Eggert Mills, Greensand,[citation needed] Haven Homes,[citation 
needed] Lahiere,[citation needed] Lincoln Park,[citation needed] Lindenau, 
Martins Landing,[citation needed] Menlo Park, Millville, New Dover, New 
Durham, Nixon, Nixon Park, North Edison,[citation needed] Oak Tree, Phoenix, 
Potters, Pumptown, Raritan Arsenal, Raritan Manor,[citation needed], Roosevelt 
Park, Sand Hills,[citation needed] Silver Lake, Stelton, Valentine and 
Washington Park.[citation needed][40] Extreme temperatures in Edison have 
ranged from −17 °F (−27 °C), recorded in February 1934, to 106 °F (41 °C), 
recorded in July 1936 and August 1949. Edison hosts one of the region's 
main centers of Asian American cultural diversity.[42][43][44] As part 
of the 2010 Census, 28.3% of Edison residents identified themselves as 
being Indian American.[10] In the 2000 Census, 17.75% of Edison residents 
identified themselves as being Indian American, the highest percentage 
of Indian American people of any place in the United States with 1,000 
or more residents identifying their ancestry.[45] Edison is also developing 
a sprawling suburban Chinatown.[46] At the 2010 United States Census, there 
were 99,967 people, 34,972 households, and 26,509 families residing in 
the township. The population density was 3,339.0 per square mile (1,289.2/km2). 
There were 36,302 housing units at an average density of 1,212.5 per square

2006-2010 American Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted 
dollars) median household income was $86,725 (with a margin of error of 
+/- $3,000) and the median family income was $100,008 (+/- $2,624). Males

for females. The per capita income for the township was $36,464 (+/- $1,184). 
About 3.5% of families and 7.2% of the population were below the poverty

For decades, Central Jersey was a hub for manufacturing in the eastern 
United States. Many industrial companies had major production facilities 
in and around the area, including Edison Assembly, Ford Motor Company's 
production plant for Rangers, Mustangs, Pintos, Mercurys, and Lincolns. 
Other notable companies included General Motors in Linden, Frigidaire's 
air-conditioner plant in Edison, Hess Corporation in Woodbridge, Siemens 
in Edison, and ExxonMobil Chemical. Starting in the 2000s, manufacturing 
began to leave Central Jersey, and many facilities closed and moved overseas.[58][59][60] 
The Ford plant was demolished by 2008 and plans were made for retail and 
hotel development at the site.[61] Majesco Entertainment, a video game 
company, has its corporate headquarters in Edison.[62] Other companies 
have warehouse operations within Edison. These companies include the Italian 
food producer and importer Colavita, as well as the regional hubs for FedEx, 
UPS, and Newegg. In addition Edison is home to the state's largest private 
convention center, the New Jersey Convention and Exposition Center, located 
within the Raritan Center Business Park.[63] Raritan Center itself is the 
largest industrial park on the east side of the Mississippi River. The 
United States headquarters of the international company Zylog Systems is 
located in Edison,[64] as is the headquarters of the e-commerce company 
Boxed.[65] Plainfield Country Club is a private country club that has hosted 
the 1987 U.S. Women's Open Golf Championship and the The Barclays golf 
tournament, the first PGA Tour FedEx Cup playoff event, in both 2011 and 
2015.[66] Oak Tree Pond is the site of the Battle of Short Hills, a minor 
battle of the American Revolutionary War and whose conversion into a park 
ended a real estate development controversy.[67] Roosevelt Park, located 
between Parsonage Road and Route 1, west of the Mall, covers 217 acres 
(88 ha), including the 8-acre (3.2 ha) Roosevelt Park Lake. The park was 
established in 1917, making it the oldest county park in Middlesex County.[68] 
Edison Township operates within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the 
Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council form of government, 
which was implemented as of January 1, 1958, based on the recommendations 
of a Charter Study Commission.[69] Edison is governed by a mayor and a 
seven-member Township Council. Members of the council are elected at-large 
in partisan elections held as part of the November general election to 
four-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with three or four seats 
coming up for election every even year, with the mayoral seat up for vote 
at the same time that three seats are expiring.[8][70] As of 2016[update], 
the Mayor of Edison is Democrat Thomas Lankey, whose term of office ends 
December 31, 2017.[4] Members of the Township Council are Council President 
Michael R. Lombardi (D, 2019), Council Vice President Alvaro Gomez (D, 
2017), Joseph Coyle (D, 2019; appointed to serve an unexpired term), Robert 
C. Diehl (D, 2017), Ajay Patil (D, 2019), Leonard D. Sendelsky (D, 2019) 
and Sapana Shah (D, 2017).[71][72][73][74][75] In June 2016, the Township 
Council selected Joseph Coyle from a list of three candidates nominated 
by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 
2019 that had been held by Robert Karabinchak, until he stepped down from 
office to take a vacant seat in the New Jersey General Assembly; Coyle 
will serve until the November 2016 general election, when voters will chose 
a candidate to fill the balance of the term of office.[76] The past and 
only female Mayor of Edison was Antonia "Toni" Ricigliano, whose term of 
office ended on December 31, 2013.[77][78] Running on a good government 
platform and a call to reform the Democratic Party, Jun Choi won the June 
2005 primary by a 56–44% margin, defeating longtime incumbent Mayor George 
A. Spadoro, the first time in Edison history that a challenger won the 
Democratic primary.[79] Choi won endorsements from mainstream Democratic 
leaders including Bill Bradley, for whom he worked on the 2000 presidential 
campaign, and was unexpectedly endorsed by a number of traditionally candidate-neutral 
unions in Edison. In the ensuing general election, Choi did not face a 
Republican candidate, but instead faced a former Democrat turned Independent, 
William (Bill) Stephens. An article in The American Prospect details aspects 
that Choi brought together in his 2005 mayoral campaign, including 1. attracting 
new voters into the process, 2. a good government message, 3. anti-Wal-Mart 
or economic justice theme and 4. an effective Internet-based progressive 
mobilization.[80] On Election Day, November 8, 2005, Jun Choi declared 
victory, leading in unofficial results with a vote of 12,126 to 11,935. 
However, due to the small margin of victory, candidate William Stephens 
pursued a recount and subsequently, an election contest, both without success. 
On January 1, 2006, at age 34, Mayor Choi was sworn-in by Governor Jon 
Corzine as the youngest Mayor in Edison history. Choi ran for re-election 
in 2009, but was defeated in the primary election by Antonia "Toni" Ricigliano, 
who went on to win the general election, and took office January 1, 2010. 
Recent politics in Edison have concerned plans for zoning the township 
to facilitate the creation of "walkable" communities that will attract 
businesses, while still maintaining open spaces and parks and easy access 
to commuter transit. This strategy is meant to encourage "Smart Growth."[81] 
Politics in Edison since the 2005 mayoral election have been polarized 
by an attempt by retail giant Walmart to open a store in central Edison 
near the junction of Interstate 287 and New Jersey Route 27. Even though 
Jun Choi stated in his Mayoral Campaign that he would stop Walmart from 
being built, Walmart filed suit and won, and Choi was there to cut the 
yellow ribbon when the store was opened.[citation needed] The town is served 
by the full-time Edison Division of Police, led by Chief Thomas Bryan and 
employing 168 officers as of 2012, assisted by the Edison Auxiliary Police.[82] 
The department is striving to overcome a history of widespread officer 
misconduct.[83][84][85][86][87] Edison is located in the 6th Congressional 
District[88] and is part of New Jersey's 18th state legislative district.[11][89][90] 
Prior to the 2010 Census, Edison had been split between the 6th congressional 
District and the 7th Congressional District, a change made by the New Jersey 
Redistricting Commission that took effect in January 2013, based on the 
results of the November 2012 general elections.[91] New Jersey's Sixth 
Congressional District is represented by Frank Pallone (D, Long Branch).[92] 
New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Cory Booker (D, 
Newark, term ends 2021)[93] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 2019).[94][95] 
For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General Assembly), the 18th Legislative 
District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate 
by Patrick J. Diegnan (D, South Plainfield) and in the General Assembly 
by Robert Karabinchak (D, Edison) and Nancy Pinkin (D, East Brunswick).[96] 
In May 2016, Diegnan was chosen to fill the vacant seat of Peter J. Barnes 
III, who left the Senate to become a judge on New Jersey Superior Court, 
while Karabinchak was chosen to fill Diegnan's vacant Assembly seat.[97] 
The Governor of New Jersey is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[98] 
The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[99] 
Middlesex County is governed by a Board of Chosen Freeholders, whose seven 
members are elected at-large on a partisan basis to serve three-year terms 
of office on a staggered basis, with either two or three seats coming up 
for election each year as part of the November general election. At an 
annual reorganization meeting held in January, the board selects from among 
its members a Freeholder Director and Deputy Director. As of 2015[update], 
Middlesex County's Freeholders (with party affiliation, term-end year, 
residence and committee chairmanship listed in parentheses) are Freeholder 
Director Ronald G. Rios (D, term ends December 31, 2015, Carteret; Ex-officio 
on all committees),[100] Freeholder Deputy Director Carol Barrett Bellante 
(D, 2017; Monmouth Junction, South Brunswick Township; County Administration),[101]

Charles Kenny ( D, 2016, Woodbridge Township; Finance),[103] H. James Polos 
(D, 2015, Highland Park; Public Safety and Health),[104] Charles E. Tomaro 
(D, 2017, Edison; Infrastructure Management)[105] and Blanquita B. Valenti 
(D, 2016, New Brunswick; Community Services).[106][107] Constitutional 
officers are County Clerk Elaine M. Flynn (D, Old Bridge Township),[108] 
Sheriff Mildred S. Scott (D, 2016, Piscataway)[109] and Surrogate Kevin 
J. Hoagland (D, 2017; New Brunswick).[107][110] As of March 23, 2011, there

school Lincoln Tech (formerly the Cittone Institute) has a campus on Oak 
Tree Road in Edison. Lincoln Tech in Edison offers various programs in 
Nursing and in medical and computer applications. In Edison, the sizeable 
Asian/Chinese population had pushed for years to establish a Chinese School 
where students could learn the Chinese language. In 1998, Huaxia Edison 
Chinese School (which teaches Simplified Chinese) was established in Thomas 
Jefferson Middle School. Huaxia currently resides in Edison High School. 
However, many families from Taiwan send their children to Edison Chinese 
School, located at John Adams Middle School, or Tzu Chi, located at Woodrow 
Wilson Middle School. These schools both teach Traditional Chinese. JP 
Stevens High School also offers Mandarin Chinese and Hindi as an elective 
language for students who are interested in learning it. Lincoln Technical 
Institute, a for-profit vocational school.[145] Middlesex County College 
(MCC) is a public, two-year community college located in Edison at the 
intersection of Woodbridge Avenue and Mill Road.[146] Rutgers University's 
Livingston campus is located on the former Kilmer Army Base, partially 
located in Edison.[147] Edison is a transportation hub, with an extensive 
network of highways passing through the township and connecting to major 
Northeast cities, New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Trenton, Washington, 
D.C. and others. As of May 2010[update], the township had a total of 307.05 
miles (494.15 km) of roadways, of which 257.31 miles (414.10 km) were maintained 
by the municipality, 29.78 miles (47.93 km) by Middlesex County and 14.75 
miles (23.74 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and 5.21 
miles (8.38 km) by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.[148] Edison hosts 
various roadways. State roads include Route 27, and 440, both of which 
are state-maintained. U.S. Route 1 also passes through the township. Interstate 
287 passes through Edison, where it houses its southern end at I-95. The 
municipality also houses about a 5-mile (8.0 km) section of the New Jersey 
Turnpike (Interstate 95). Exit 10 is located in Edison, featuring a 13-lane 
toll gate and a "unique" interchange design. When the "dual-dual" setup 
of the turnpike was created, it first started in Edison Township, and continued 
north to Exit 14 in Newark. It wasn't until 1973 that the "dual-dual" was 
extended south of 10 to Exit 9 in East Brunswick Township (and then extended 
further south in 1990 to Exit 8A in Monroe Township). Since Interstate 
287 connects to Interstate 87 (the New York State Thruway), Exit 10 (of 
the turnpike) is one of the busiest interchanges to be used by tractor-trailers 
as it connects the New Jersey Turnpike to the New York Thruway. For truck 
drivers, it is the only connection they have to the Thruway as the Garden 
State Parkway, which has its northern terminus at the Thruway, prohibits 
trucks from using the roadway north of Exit 105. Due to Interstate 95's 
discontinuity in New Jersey, U.S. 1 serves as a regional artery linking 
the New Jersey Turnpike and Interstate 287 to Interstate 95 and Interstate 
295. In 2009, the New Jersey Department of Transportation selected Edison 
as one of the first communities to have a red light camera enforcement 
system. The program ended in December 2014.[149] Edison station, located 
in South Edison, is served by New Jersey Transit northbound trains to Newark 
Penn Station and Penn Station New York, and southbound to the Trenton Transit 
Center via the Northeast Corridor Line, with connecting service to Amtrak, 
and SEPTA.[150][151] Some passengers in North Edison may actually live 
closer to, and prefer to use, the Metropark (near neighboring Iselin in 
Woodbridge Township) or Metuchen stations.[152][153] New Jersey Transit 
bus service is provided on the 62 route to Newark, with local service available 
on the 801, 804, 805, 810, 813, 814, 819, 978 and 979 routes.[154] The 
Taiwanese airline China Airlines provides private bus service to John F. 
Kennedy International Airport from the Kam Man Food location in Edison 
to feed its flight to Taipei, Taiwan.[155] John F. Kennedy Hospital, located 
on James Street off Parsonage Road is a 498-bed hospital founded in 1967.[156] 
Roosevelt Care Center is a long term/sub-acute care faciliity located just 
East of Roosevelt Park. The facility was original constructed in 1936 under 
the auspices of the Work Projects Administration.[157] Edison is served 
by area codes 732 and 848 and 908. Area Code 848 is an overlay area code 
that was created so there a split was not needed. Edison has five Verizon 
Central offices serving the Township: In 1982, The BPU and New Jersey Bell, 
after receiving thousands and complaints from both North and South Edison 
residents, had made an exception that any calls originating and terminating 
in the Township would be considered a local call. This was due to the new 
home construction in Edison were existing cables that belonged to the Rahway 
central office were assigned to give new phone service to over 400 homes. 
In 1997, mandatory ten-digit dialing came to Edison with the introduction 
of Area code 732. Edison residents living on Roxy Avenue once again were 
in the spotlight in the news, with one side of the street served by the 
Rahway central office (Area code 732) and the other side of the street 
is served by the Plainfield central office (Area Code 908). Residents complained 
to the BPU and Bell Atlantic that it would be easier to yell across the 
street then dial a ten-digit number call their neighbor across the street. 
Edison has Cablevision's Optimum cable television service. Before Cablevision, 
there was TKR, which was so poorly run that many FCC and BPU complaints 
about programming and many town hall meetings eventually forced change. 
TKR was bought out by Cablevision. People who were born in, residents of,
