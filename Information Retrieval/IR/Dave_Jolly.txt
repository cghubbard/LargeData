David Jolly (October 14, 1924 – May 27, 1963) was a Major League Baseball 
relief pitcher. The 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m), 165 lb (75 kg) right-hander was 
a native of Stony Point, North Carolina. He was signed by the St. Louis 
Browns as an amateur free agent before the 1946 season. After pitching 
in the Browns, Cincinnati Reds, and New York Yankees organizations, he 
was drafted by the Boston Braves from the Yankees in the 1952 rule V draft 
(December 1). He played for the Milwaukee Braves from 1953 to 1957 and 
was a member of the 1957 World Series championship team. Jolly made his 
major league debut in relief on May 9, 1953, against the Chicago Cubs at 
Milwaukee County Stadium. From 1953 to 1957, the first five years that 
the Braves were in Milwaukee, he was second on the pitching staff with 
158 relief appearances, an average of almost 32 per season. During those 
seasons the closer's job was held at different times by Lew Burdette, Ernie 
Johnson, Jolly, and Don McMahon. Jolly's best season was 1954, when he 
was 11–6 with 10 saves and a 2.43 earned run average in 47 games. He finished 
in the National League Top Ten for winning percentage, games pitched, games 
finished, and saves. Career totals for 160 games (159 as a pitcher) include 
a record of 16–14, 1 game started, 0 complete games, 82 games finished, 
19 saves, and an ERA of 3.77. He wielded a strong bat for a pitcher, going 
14-for-48 (.292) with 1 home run, 7 runs batted in, and 8 runs scored. 
On October 15, 1957, Jolly was purchased from the Braves by the San Francisco
