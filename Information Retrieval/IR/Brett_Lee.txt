Brett Lee (born 8 November 1976) is a former Australian international cricketer, 
Channel Nine cricket commentator and film actor. During his international 
career, Lee was recognised as one of the two fastest bowlers in the world 
of cricket along with Shoaib Akhtar. He is known for his consistency of 
pace, going over 155 kilometres per hour (96 mph) throughout his career. 
His quickest delivery was 161.8 km/h (100.5 mph) in a test match against 
the West Indies in 2002, but because they were playing in a charity match, 
it was not officially recognised as the fastest delivery ever. After that 
the world record for the fastest delivery ever is held by Shoaib Akhtar 
at 161.3 km/h (100.2 mph). Lee's quickest delivery in ODIs is 161.1 km/h 
(100.1 mph) playing against New Zealand in 2005. He is also widely regarded 
as one of the best pace bowlers ever to have played the sport. Lee was 
known for reaching a hundred miles an hour many times throughout his cricketing 
career. In each of his first two years, he averaged less than 20 with the 
ball, but since then has mostly achieved figures in the early 30s.[1] He 
was also known as an athletic fielder and useful lower-order batsman, with 
a batting average exceeding 20 in Test cricket. Lee finished his Test with 
310 wickets, and his One Day International career with 380 wickets. Lee 
featured in the Australian teams that won the 2003 and 2007 World Cups. 
He announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket in 
12 July 2012, having played his first Test in 1999. He subsequently declined 
to renew his contract with his home state side New South Wales, but continued 
to play Twenty20 matches for several seasons after, most notably in the 
Indian Premier League (IPL) and Big Bash League.[2] In January 2015, Lee 
announced his retirement from all forms of the game, effective at the end 
of the 2014–15 Big Bash League season.[3] Lee was known for his pace and 
regularly clocked 90 mph (140 km/h) and above. He ranks only behind Pakistani 
bowler Shoaib Akhtar (161.3 km/h, 100.2 mph) as the fastest bowler in contemporary 
cricket during most of the 2000s.[4] The strain of consistently bowling 
at 150 km/h (93 mph) caused a string of stress fractures and recurring 
injuries and forced him to alter his strategy, which he has done effectively.[5] 
Rather than relying on pace alone, he uses a wide array of deliveries aimed 
at wearing down the batsman, although he has been known to bowl entire 
overs above the 150 km/h (93 mph) mark. His fastest ball was clocked at 
161.1 km/h (100.1 mph) against New Zealand in 2005. In a match against 
West Indies in 2000/01 he bowled a delivery which was clocked at 161.8 km/h 
(100.5 mph), but it was not an official match and therefore not recognised 
by the ICC. Early in his career, Lee was reported for a suspected illegal 
bowling action, but was cleared,[6] and was also heavily criticised after 
bowling a series of beamers at batsmen during a number of ODIs in 2005. 
Captain Ricky Ponting defended Lee saying that it was not intentional.[7][8] 
His slower balls also has dramatic falls of pace with varying length, often 
from a cutter grip, where it can go as slow as 100 km/h (62 mph), but it 
hovers on average around the 115–130 km/h (71–81 mph) range. He is also 
known to celebrate many bowled wickets with a chainsaw celebration.[9] 
Lee was a competent lower-order batsman. Together with Mike Hussey, he 
has held the record for highest 7th wicket partnership for Australia in 
ODIs since 2005–06 with 123.[10] During the 2005 Ashes series, Lee had 
numerous defiant innings, including a stand of 43 not out in the Second 
Test at Edgbaston, Australia's highest individual score in that innings. 
This innings nearly won the match for Australia but the other batsman Michael 
Kasprowicz was caught behind by Geraint Jones and England won by just two 
runs. After the memorable match, England bowlers Steve Harmison and Andrew 
Flintoff went over to console Lee. The image of Flintoff consoling Lee 
was a moment which came to symbolise a hotly contested series.[11] On 2 
April 2006, Lee hit his highest Test score of 64 in 68 balls against South 
Africa at Johannesburg. His previous highest score in Tests was 62 not 
out which he made against the West Indies in 2000 at the Gabba. Lee nearly 
surpassed this score on 3 January 2008 against India when he made 59 off 
121 balls. Lee had also once again nearly surpassed his highest test score 
when he had made 63 not out, but unfortunately Ricky Ponting had declared 
the innings in the 2nd test against the West Indies. As a result of this, 
he fell one run short of his highest test score. Lee's highest score in 
ODI matches is 59 against West Indies at West Indies in March 2012. Lee 
started playing in the junior teams of his local side, Oak Flats Rats, 
and gradually worked his way up the ranks. At 16 he began playing first 
grade cricket for Campbelltown, where he managed to claim the wickets of 
a few New South Wales cricketers, and Mosman,[12] where at one point, he 
shared the new ball with Shoaib Akhtar and briefly played alongside England 
batsman Andrew Strauss.[13][14] Lee was called up to the Australian Under 
17 & 19 teams. In March 1994, he was forced out of the Australian under-19 
team to tour India due to stress fractures in his lower back and it forced 
him to remodel his bowling action to minimise the impact on his back. He 
was awarded a scholarship to attend the AIS Australian Cricket Academy 
in the 1995–96 season.[15] His contemporaries included fellow internationals 
Jason Gillespie and Mike Hussey.[16] Prior to making his first-class debut, 
Lee played for Mosman in the final of the 1996–97 Sydney Grade Cricket 
competition.[17] Lee was first named in the New South Wales Blues squad 
as the twelfth man for the 14–16 November match against Queensland in the 
1997–98 Sheffield Shield.[18] The following week, he made his first-class 
debut for the Blues against Western Australia and took 3 wickets at 114, 
including that of the captain Tom Moody.[19] It would be his only appearance 
in the Sheffield Shield for the rest of the season.[20] He ended a memorable 
month by taking a 5-wicket haul in the Sydney grade Limited-Overs Cup final 
against Bankstown on 30 November.[21] During the 1998–99 season Lee was 
a more regular presence in the latter stages of the Sheffield Shield. He 
took 14 wickets, including a 5-wicket haul against Tasmania in the second 
innings.[22] He started the 1999–2000 season by claiming 8 wickets in his 
first two matches. Such performances impressed his New South Wales teammate 
Steve Waugh, who was then Australia captain, and culminated in his Test 
debut in December 1999. He finished the season as the Blues' second-highest 
wicket taker in the Pura Cup with 24 wickets in 5 matches.[23][24] After 
a successful Test series against India, Lee returned to domestic cricket 
and was named in the 2008 Pura Cup final.[25] He hit his career best batting 
score, 97 against Victoria in the Blues' second innings and scored a record 
176-run partnership with Beau Casson.[26][27] In Victoria's second innings, 
he took 4–72, dismissing the last four tailenders, as the Blues won the 
final. In 2009 he battled back from injury and was a key player in New 
South Wales' success during the Champions League Twenty20. During the final 
he played an important part with both bat and ball and was named Man of 
the Match.[28][29] He also won the Man of the Series award.[30] Following 
his retirement from Test cricket, Lee stopped playing first-class cricket 
to concentrate on the limited-overs formats. He was the Blues' highest 
wicket-taker in the 2010–11 Ryobi One-Day Cup with 15 wickets and had the 
second best economy rate of the top five wicket-takers despite missing 
the latter stages of the campaign due to international duty. In June 2012 
he declined to renew his contract with the Blues, ending his 15-year association 
with his domestic team.[31] He retired from Big Bash League after playing 
the final match for the Sydney Sixers on 28 January 2015.[32] In his last 
over, he took two wickets of successive deliveries, however, his hat-trick 
ball did not result in a run out in what was to be the final ball of the 
match, which Sydney Sixers lost by a run.[33] One month after making his 
first class debut, Lee was chosen to represent the Australian A team on 
a tour to South Africa. He claimed two wickets but in that very match, 
stress fractures in his back from the previous injury had re-opened and 
Lee was in a back brace for over three months. By the late 1990s there 
were calls for Lee to be included in the national squad. Captain Steve 
Waugh, who also played with him for New South Wales, was impressed by Lee's 
debut and pushed for his inclusion into the national team. He was eventually 
chosen in the final 14 for the Test series against Pakistan in 1999 but 
failed to make the starting 11. By the time the Test series against India 
came around, he was twelfth man. However, he duly made his Test debut for 
Australia in December 1999 against the touring Indians, becoming Australia's 
383rd Test cricketer. Bowling first change, Lee took a wicket in his first 
over in Test cricket when he bowled Sadagoppan Ramesh with his fourth delivery. 
He also captured Rahul Dravid in his first spell before returning to take 
three wickets in six balls to finish the innings with figures of 5/47 from 
17 overs, becoming the first Australian fast bowler since Dennis Lillee 
to take 5 wickets on debut.[34][35] Lee took 13 wickets in his opening 
two Tests at the low average of 14.15. Lee won the inaugural Donald Bradman 
Young Player of the Year Award at the Allan Border Medal award ceremony 
in 2000 soon after his debut. Lee took 42 wickets in his opening three 
series, the most by any Australian bowler in the seven matches he played.[36] 
He was selected for the Test series against the West Indies in late 2000. 
During the first Test he scored his first half-century in test cricket 
and in the next Test, took seven wickets including a five wicket haul in 
the second innings.[37] However, he suffered a stress fracture of the lower 
back which kept him out of the next three Tests. He returned against Zimbabwe 
but soon suffered another setback a month later when he broke his right 
elbow and was sidelined until May 2001.[citation needed] Lee returned to 
the international team for the 2001 Ashes series after recovering from 
an elbow injury. His comeback saw less success than his debut, managing 
only nine wickets in five Tests at 55.11. However, Lee was back as Australia's 
leading wicket-taker in the first and third Test against New Zealand later 
that year, in a series which he captured 5 wickets in the second innings 
and made a contribution of 61 with the bat in the first Test match. The 
series ended in a 0–0 draw. He finished the series with 14 wickets at 25.14. 
The two home and away series against South Africa were not as productive, 
yielding 19 wickets in six Tests at 38.42. Lee only took five wickets in 
a match on three occasions between the New Zealand series and the 2003 
Cricket World Cup. Lee came under pressure for his position after taking 
only five wickets at 46.50 in the three-Test series against Pakistan in 
2002. Andy Bichel, who was filling for the injured Jason Gillespie, took 
eight wickets at 13.25. With the other frontline bowlers all taking wickets 
at less than 13,[38] Lee was dropped when Gillespie returned for the first 
two Tests during the 2002–03 Ashes series. He returned for the Perth Test, 
after claiming a five wicket haul in a Pura Cup match against Queensland 
for New South Wales. He took thirteen wickets at 41.23 in three matches, 
compared to Bichel's ten at 35.1.[39] After the 2003 Cricket World Cup, 
Lee took 17 wickets at 28.88 in four Tests against the West Indies. It 
was the first series in two years where he averaged under 30, and only 
the second in that period where had averaged under 40. After a mid year 
break, he participated in a Two Test series against Bangladesh in northern 
Australia. He took six wickets at 31.66, and was Australia's most expensive 
bowler, with the other specialist bowlers averaging 15.55 against the lowest 
ranked team in Test cricket. He followed this with six wickets at 37 in 
a comfortable 2–0 Test series against Zimbabwe, in which the other specialist 
bowlers averaged 23.15.[40] Against the Indian batting line-up in the 2003–04 
home series, which ended in a 1–1 draw for Australia, Lee was out of the 
first two Tests recovering from a torn abdominal muscle, an injury which 
he sustained during the Zimbabwe series.[41] Lee took eight wickets in 
100 overs in the final two Tests against India, at an average of 59.50. 
This Test included a double century to Sachin Tendulkar in the Indians' 
first innings of 7/705 where Sachin and V.V.S. Laxman freely attacked Lee 
and other bowlers in the final Test in Sydney. He ended the series with 
the worst average and economy rate of Australia's front line bowlers.[42] 
He was subsequently replaced by fellow fast bowler Michael Kasprowicz in 
2004 during the tour of Sri Lanka when Lee's ankle injury worsened, forcing 
him to return home to have surgery. This injury would force Lee out of 
the game for 4½ months to ensure his full recovery. Lee's form in the Test 
arena had been ineffective, and from July 2001 to January 2004, he had 
a Test bowling average of 38.42,[43] compared to an average of 16.07 in 
his earlier career. Lee was unable to reclaim his position for eighteen 
months, when Kasprowicz took 47 wickets at 23.74 in thirteen Tests, taking 
his wickets at a much lower cost than Lee had done in the previous three 
years. This included 17 wickets at 26.82 on the spin friendly pitches of 
the Indian subcontinent, helping Australia to its first whitewash in Sri 
Lanka, and its first series win in India for 35 years.[44] After 18 months 
on the sidelines, Lee returned to the Test team in the 2005 Ashes series. 
With Kasprowicz and Jason Gillespie both struggling for form, Lee returned 
to take the new ball with Glenn McGrath. He averaged 40 with the ball for 
the series, which some commentators have put down to having to bowl longer 
spells than he was accustomed to at the time[citation needed], but was 
retained, in part because of his defiant batting[citation needed] which 
yielded runs at an average of 26.33. During the Ashes, he claimed his 150th 
test wicket off Andrew Strauss with a straight yorker on Day 1 of the third 
test. Part of Lee's difficulty at Test level is that the benefits of his 
high speed, which give the batsmen less reaction time, also results in 
more erratic bowling. In recent times he has tried to concentrate solely 
on accuracy by reducing speed. During the first Test against the West Indies 
in late 2005 at the Gabba, after declaring that he would sacrifice pace 
and focus on 'line and length',[45] Lee reverted to his initial style of 
bowling, based on the advice of his captain Ricky Ponting after his new 
method of bowling failed in the first innings.[46] This saw him take 5/30 
his fifth five-wicket haul in Tests, his first in four years. In the 2005-06 
Australian cricket season, Lee's Test figures improved from his 2001–04 
difficulties, with a season bowling average of 25.74. During South Africa's 
2005–06 tour of Australia, Lee's form saw a steady improvement, with figures 
of 5/93 in the first Test at Perth. He finished the three Test series with 
13 wickets and of the Australian bowlers, was second only to Shane Warne's 
14 wickets in the series. Three Australian players including Lee, who was 
reprimanded in the Third Test in Sydney for showing dissent towards umpire 
Aleem Dar.[47] With the unavailability of Glenn McGrath for the tour of 
South Africa in March–April 2006, Lee became the spearhead of the Australian 
bowling line-up.[48] In the second Test of that series, at Durban, Lee 
captured his 200th Test wicket in his 51st match and also captured figures 
of 5 for 69, on the back of 49 Test wickets in 2005.[49] He was named as 
one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. He was unable to maintain his 
performance when Australia visited Bangladesh for a two Test series, taking 
two wickets at 93, coming bottom of Australia's bowling averages.[50] In 
the first three tests of the 2006–07 Ashes series, he only took eight wickets 
and was fined for excessive appealing in the Third Test in Adelaide when 
a LBW decision was not in his favour.[47] However, during the week period 
between the Adelaide and Melbourne tests, he worked with Troy Cooley, Australia's 
bowling coach, to adjust his run up and came back in the 4th and final 
tests with more wickets. He finished the series 20 wickets, with his best 
bowling figures being 4 for 47 at an average of 33.20, including 6 in the 
final test. His tally was only bettered by his teammates Stuart Clark, 
Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath as the quartet claimed more wickets than 
the entire England bowling attack combined.[51] Following the retirements 
of Warne and McGrath, Lee rose to the challenge and was awarded the Man 
of the Series in the inaugural Warne-Muralidaran Trophy, a two-Test series 
against Sri Lanka in late-2007. In his first series as bowling spearhead 
reaped 16 wickets at an average of 17.5. This was achieved by bowling 5 km/h 
(3.1 mph) slower to improve accuracy. In the following series Lee took 
24 wickets at 22.58 in four Tests against India. In this series he overtook 
Jason Gillespie to become Australia's 5th highest wicket taker. His consistent 
efforts saw him rewarded with the Man of the Series Award for the Border-Gavaskar 
Trophy, 2007–08. He capped off the season by winning the Allan Border Medal, 
the award given to the player adjudged Australia's best international cricketer 
of the past year. Lee seemed underdone in the 2008 Australian tour of the 
West Indies, taking only 5 wickets in the first Test match, during which 
he seemed exhausted. He returned to productivity, taking eight wickets 
in the Second test, including a 5 wicket haul, and 6 in the Third Test. 
During the Indian tour, Lee picked up a stomach virus and was unable to 
find his best form throughout the series. Lee showed glimpses of his best 
form[citation needed] when the team returned to Australia for a two test 
series with New Zealand, but generally seemed down on pace. However, he 
struggled in the two tests he played of the series with South Africa, which 
Australia lost 2–1, likely due to a niggling ankle injury and then a stress 
fracture he developed during the series (both in his left foot). The fracture 
broke completely during the second innings of the Boxing Day Test-match 
and he was forced to return home for surgery. By the time he returned to 
the Australian team for the Ashes in 2009, his position as spearhead had 
been usurped by the left armer Mitchell Johnson. Additionally, the arrival 
of bowlers like Peter Siddle, Ben Hilfenhaus and Doug Bollinger ensured 
that Lee had to fight for a position in the team. However, he took six 
wickets in the first innings against the England Lions team in a practice 
match leading up to the Ashes. Lee was the only bowler to get reverse swing 
in this match and appeared to be in line for selection for the First Test 
at Cardiff. However, he picked up a left side strain and a sore rib in 
this match and he was ruled out of the first three Tests. He was then overlooked 
for a recall and never played test cricket again, announcing his retirement 
from test cricket at the beginning of 2010. Lee had been considering retiring 
from Test cricket for some time since 2008 due to the physical strain. 
In February 2010, he announced his retirement from Test cricket after consulting 
friend and England rival Andrew Flintoff, stating that bowling "at 150kmph 
for five days is very hard on the body".[11][52] He had been out with a 
string of injuries and had not played a Test since December 2008. He ended 
his Test career with 310 wickets in 76 tests, the fourth highest Australian 
total behind Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Dennis Lillee. Lee made his 
One Day International debut for Australia against Pakistan on 9 January 
2000 during the Carlton and United Breweries Series at the Gabba, Brisbane. 
He became the 140th ODI cricketer to represent Australia. In February 2002 
against South Africa, he scored his first ODI half century, 51* not out. 
In One-day Internationals, he was ranked by the ICC as the No. 1 ODI bowler 
in January 2006[53] and has been ranked among the top ten ODI bowlers since 
the start of 2003. His bowling strike rate of around 30 puts him amongst 
the most incisive in this form of the game. He also has a One-day International 
hat-trick to his name, achieved in the 2003 World Cup against Kenya. Lee 
was the first Australian and fourth bowler to ever achieve this feat in 
World Cup history. In the matches Australia played in the 2005–06 triangular 
one day series, Lee gave a display of his useful batting abilities by making 
57 in the second game in a 100 run partnership with Michael Hussey to pull 
Australia out of a middle order collapse. Lee finished the series with 
15 wickets, the third highest tally behind Nathan Bracken and Muttiah Muralitharan. 
His bowler-fielder partnership with long-time international teammate and 
wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist yielded 58 wickets in 151 matches, the fourth 
highest of all time in ODI history.[54] With main bowler Shane Warne banned 
from the 2003 World Cup the day before the opening match, Lee moved up 
the pecking order and, together with Andy Bichel and Glenn McGrath, formed 
one of the tournament's most lethal attacks, claiming 59 wickets between 
them. Lee concluded the tournament with 22 wickets off 83.1 overs at an 
average of 17.90, a wicket behind Sri Lankan left-arm fastbowler Chaminda 
Vaas. Lee also had a third leading strike-rate of 22.68 behind West Indian 
fast bowler Vasbert Drakes and Australian counterpart Andrew Bichel who 
topped the strike-rates with 19.43 and 21.37 respectively. He also reached 
the 160 km/h (99 mph) mark twice; his delivery to Marvan Atapattu in the 
semi-final of the reached 160.1 km/h (99.5 mph)[55] and hit 160.7 km/h 
(99.9 mph) in his first over against England in the group stage.[56] Lee 
earned six of his 22 wickets during the group stage, 11 wickets during 
the Super-six stage, 3 from the semi-final and 2 wickets from the final 
which Australia won. He took one five-wicket haul, 5 for 42, against Trans-Tasman 
rivals New Zealand during their super-six encounter at Port Elizabeth to 
put Australia ahead after a dismal innings.[57] He also earned his first 
international hat trick with figures of 3 for 14 against Kenya during the 
last match of the super-six stage.[58] After having to return home due 
to injury during the 2007 World Cup, Lee traveled with the squad to England 
for the 2009 "English summer" tour. He was left out of the test side during 
the Ashes but was in the one-day side for the NatWest Series in September. 
He was the highest wicket-taker for Australia with 12 and also took his 
ninth five-wicket haul in ODIs as Australia made a clean sweep winning 
all except one match in the series.[59] With that five-wicket haul, he 
became the first person to take two five-wicket hauls in ODIs at Lord's; 
the ball used is now on display at Lord's MCC Museum.[60] Later that month 
he was a part of the successful 2009 ICC Champions Trophy squad and was 
level on 6 wickets with teammates Peter Siddle and Shane Watson, the highest 
total for the Australian team. Injuries sustained in test matches forced 
him out until 2011, having not played for Australia for almost two years. 
In the subsequent ODI series, his return was more successful. He finished 
as the leading wicket-taker for the series with 11 scalps at 24.00, his 
series best figures of 3/27 coming in the third match at the SCG. His pace 
was consistently around the mid 140s km/h and on occasion he once again 
managed to break the 150 km/h (93 mph) mark.[citation needed]. Despite 
competition from younger bowlers and another injury setback, Lee managed 
to make the squad for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He finished the tournament 
with 13 wickets, the highest of all the bowlers in the team. Of the 13 
wickets, 4 came in the match against Pakistan but it was not enough as 
Australia lost the match and eventually crashed out at the quarterfinals 
to rivals India. Against the West Indies in March 2012 he hit his highest 
score, 59 before getting caught off a ball by Kemar Roach. His final ODIs 
were during the 2012 tour of England and Ireland. During the match against 
Ireland he opened the bowling and bowled William Porterfield and Ed Joyce 
in only his first three deliveries.[24][61][62] Upon his retirement form 
international cricket, Lee had played in 76 Tests, 221 ODIs and 25 T20Is, 
and had equalled Glenn McGrath's run of 380 wickets in ODI matches – the 
highest for Australia.[2][63][64] In July 2014, he played for the MCC side 
in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's.[65] Lee made his Twenty20 
and T20 International debut on 15 February 2005 against New Zealand in 
the first ever T20 international match.[66] He was called up to the squad 
for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20. During the tournament, he made history 
by claiming the first hat trick in T20 internationals in the Group F match 
against Bangladesh and also won the Man of the Match award.[67] On 5 February, 
Ireland appointed Lee as a bowling coach during 2015 Cricket World Cup.[68] 
ODI Debut: vs Pakistan, Gabba, Brisbane, 1999–2000 After announcing his 
retirement from international cricket, Lee joined the Channel Nine cricket 
commentating team, reuniting with former Australia and New South Wales 
teammate Michael Slater. He also provides support for Slater on The Cricket 
Show. Lee is the second of three sons born to Bob, a metallurgist, and 
Helen (née Buxton), a piano teacher, and grew up in the Wollongong suburbs 
of Oak Flats and Mount Warrigal.[16] His older brother Shane is a retired 
all rounder and former international and younger brother Grant previously 
played cricket for New South Wales U-19, and is now an accountant.[citation 
needed] Lee attended Balarang Public School and Oak Flats High School, 
which later named its cricket ground in his honour. The brothers first 
played cricket together in front of their house using a tennis ball and 
the garage door as the "wicket-keeper".[85] As a child he idolised Allan 
Donald and Dennis Lillee, the latter of whom would become a mentor to him 
as a teenager.[16] Lee has been known by his nickname 'Binga', after the 
chain of electronics store Bing Lee, since his high-school days.[16] He 
was once briefly nicknamed "Oswald" by former Australian captain and New 
South Wales teammate Steve Waugh during his early international career. 
During an ODI around 2000, he was in the batting order behind his brother 
Shane and Ian Harvey. When Waugh read out the batting order, instead of 
reading "Lee, Harvey, Lee", he read out "Lee, Harvey, Oswald" (Lee Harvey 
Oswald).[86] Lee married Elizabeth Kemp in June 2006. They have a son named 
Preston Charles, born 16 November 2006. However, after two years of marriage, 
on 21 August 2008, Lee confirmed his separation from Kemp.[87] They divorced 
in 2009. At the time of the split, media speculation cited Kemp was having 
an affair with a rugby player in Brisbane; however, this was later disputed, 
with extended periods of loneliness due to Lee's off-season commitments 
keeping him away from Kemp and his young son Preston given as the reason 
for the marriage breakdown.[88] He married Lana Anderson in 2014 after 
one year of dating, they have a daughter named Helena together who was 
born in December 2015, Lee is part of the rock band Six & Out. The band 
is made up of his brother Shane and former New South Wales cricketers Brad 
McNamara, Gavin Robertson and Richard Chee Quee. Lee plays the bass guitar 
or acoustic guitar for the band.[89] During the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy 
in India, Lee wrote the lyrics for You're the One For Me and recorded it 
with Indian singer Asha Bhosle. The song reached a peak position of number 
two on the Indian and South African charts.[90] In 2008, he filmed scenes 
for his first Bollywood movie Victory.[91][92] In November 2011, Lee launched 
his autobiography, which he wrote with the help of author James Knight.[93][94]
