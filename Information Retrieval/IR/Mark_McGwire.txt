As player As coach Mark David McGwire (born October 1, 1963), nicknamed 
Big Mac, is an American former professional baseball player and currently 
a bench coach[1] in Major League Baseball (MLB). As a first baseman, his 
MLB career spanned from 1986 to 2001 while playing for the Oakland Athletics 
and the St. Louis Cardinals. He quickly grabbed media attention in 1987 
as a rookie with the Athletics by hitting 33 home runs before the All-Star 
break, and would lead the major leagues in home runs that year with 49, 
setting the single-season rookie record. He appeared in six straight All-Star 
Games from 1987 to 1992 despite a brief career decline related to injuries. 
Another string of six consecutive All-Star appearances followed from 1995 
to 2001. Each season from 1996 to 1999, he again led the major leagues 
in home runs. A part of the 1998 Major League Baseball home run record 
chase of Roger Maris' 61 with the Cardinals, McGwire set the major league 
single-season home run record with 70,[2] which Barry Bonds broke three 
years later with 73.[3] McGwire also led the league in runs batted in, 
twice in bases on balls and on-base percentage, and four times in slugging 
percentage. Injuries significantly cut into his playing time in 2000 and 
2001 before factoring into his retirement. He finished with 583 home runs, 
which was fifth all-time when he retired. For his career, McGwire averaged 
a home run once every 10.61 at bats, the best at bats per home run ratio 
in baseball history (Babe Ruth is second at 11.76).[4] McGwire also holds 
the distinction of being the fastest player to hit 500 home runs, in only 
5,487 at-bats.[5] In 2010, McGwire publicly admitted to using performance-enhancing 
drugs during a large portion of his career. McGwire was born in Pomona, 
California. His father was a dentist. He attended Damien High School in 
La Verne, California, where he played baseball, golf, and basketball. He 
played college baseball at the University of Southern California (where 
he was a teammate of Randy Johnson) under coach Rod Dedeaux. After three 
years at Southern California and a stint on the 1984 U.S. Olympic team, 
the Oakland Athletics drafted McGwire tenth overall in the 1984 Major League 
Baseball draft. In a short cameo, McGwire debuted in the major leagues 
in August 1986, hitting three home runs and nine runs batted in in 18 games. 
Retaining his rookie status in 1987, McGwire took center stage in baseball 
with his home runs. He hit just four in the month of April, but followed 
in May with 15, and another nine in June. Before the All-Star break arrived, 
he totaled 33 HR and earned a spot on the American League (AL) All-Star 
team. On August 11, he broke Al Rosen's AL rookie record of 37 home runs.[6] 
Three days later, McGwire broke the major league record of 38, which Frank 
Robinson and Wally Berger jointly held. In September, McGwire hit nine 
more home runs while posting monthly personal bests of a .351 batting average, 
.419 on-base percentage (OBP) and 11 doubles (2B). With 49 HR and two games 
remaining in the regular season, he chose to sit them out with an opportunity 
for 50 home runs to be present for the birth of his first child. McGwire 
also totaled 118 runs batted in (RBI), .289 batting average, 97 runs scored, 
28 doubles, a .618 slugging percentage and a .370 on-base percentage (OBP). 
Not only did he lead the AL in home runs in 1987, but he tied for the major 
league lead with Chicago Cubs right fielder Andre Dawson. McGwire also 
led the major leagues in SLG, finished second in the AL in adjusted on-base 
plus slugging percentage (OPS+, 164) total bases (344), third in RBI and 
on-base plus slugging (OPS, .987). He was thus a unanimous choice for the 
AL Rookie of the Year Award and finished sixth overall in the AL Most Valuable 
Player Award voting. From 1988 to 1990, McGwire followed with 32, 33, and 
39 home runs, respectively, becoming the first Major Leaguer to hit 30+ 
home runs in each of his first four full seasons.[7] On July 3 and 4, 1988, 
he hit game-winning home runs in the 16th inning of both games.[8][9] Through 
May 2009, McGwire was tied for third all-time with Joe DiMaggio in home 
runs over his first two calendar years in the major leagues (71), behind 
Chuck Klein (83) and Ryan Braun (79).[10] McGwire's most famous home run 
with the A's was likely his game-winning solo shot in the bottom of the 
ninth inning of Game 3 of the 1988 World Series against the Los Angeles 
Dodgers and former A's closer Jay Howell.[11] McGwire's game-winner brought 
the A's their only victory in the 1988 World Series, which they lost in 
five games. However, Big Mac and his fellow Bash Brother, José Canseco, 
played a large part in the 1989 championship club that defeated the San 
Francisco Giants in the famous "Earthquake Series".[12] Working diligently 
on his defense at first base, McGwire bristled at the notion that he was 
a one-dimensional player. He was generally regarded as a good fielder in 
his early years, even winning a Gold Glove Award in 1990 – the only one 
that New York Yankees legend Don Mattingly would not win between 1985 and 
1994. In later years, his mobility decreased and, with it, his defense. 
However, McGwire's batting averages after his rookie season plummeted to 
.260, .231, and .235 from 1988–90. In 1991, he bottomed out with a .201 
average and 22 homers. Manager Tony La Russa sat him out the final game 
of the season to avoid allowing his batting average to dip below .200. 
Despite the declining averages during this time of his career, his high 
bases on balls totals allowed him to maintain acceptable OBPs. In fact, 
when he hit .201, his OPS+ was 103, or just over league average. McGwire 
stated in an interview with Sports Illustrated that 1991 was the "worst 
year" of his life, with his on-field performance and marriage difficulties, 
and that he "didn't lift a weight" that entire season. With all that behind 
him, McGwire re-dedicated himself to working out harder than ever and received 
visual therapy from a sports vision specialist.[13][14] The "new look" 
McGwire hit 42 homers and batted .268 in 1992, with an outstanding OPS+ 
of 175 (the highest of his career to that point), and put on a home run 
hitting show at the Home Run Derby during the 1992 All-Star break. His 
performance propelled the A's to the American League West Division title 
in 1992, their fourth in five seasons. The A's lost in the playoffs to 
the eventual World Series champion, the Toronto Blue Jays. Foot injuries 
limited McGwire to a total of 74 games in 1993 and 1994, and just 9 home 
runs in each of the two seasons. He played just 104 games in 1995, but 
his proportional totals were much improved: 39 home runs in 317 at-bats. 
In 1996, McGwire belted a major league leading 52 homers in 423 at-bats. 
He also hit a career high .312 average, and led the league in both slugging 
percentage and on-base percentage. McGwire's total of 363 home runs with 
the Athletics surpassed the previous franchise record. He was selected 
or voted to nine American League All-Star Teams while playing for the A's, 
including six consecutive appearances from 1987 through 1992. He was one 
of only four players to hit a ball over the roof in the left field of Tiger 
Stadium.[15] On July 31, having already amassed 34 home runs to this point 
in the 1997 season, McGwire was traded from the Oakland Athletics to the 
St. Louis Cardinals for T. J. Mathews, Eric Ludwick and Blake Stein.[16] 
Despite playing just two-thirds of the season in the American League, he 
finished ninth in HR. With 24 more HR following his trade to the Cardinals, 
McGwire led the majors with 58 home runs in 1997. He also finished third 
in the major leagues in slugging percentage (.646), fourth in OPS (1.039), 
fifth in OPS+ (170), tenth in RBI (123), and ninth in walks (101). He placed 
16th in the NL MVP voting. It was the last year of his contract, so there 
was speculation that McGwire would play for the Cardinals only for the 
remainder of the season, then seek a long-term deal, possibly in Southern 
California, where he still lives. However, McGwire signed a contract to 
stay in St. Louis instead. It is also believed that McGwire later encouraged 
Jim Edmonds, another Southern California resident who was traded to St. 
Louis, to forgo free agency and sign a contract with the Cardinals in 2000. 
As the 1998 season progressed, it became clear that McGwire, Seattle Mariners 
outfielder Ken Griffey Jr., and Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa were 
all on track to break Roger Maris' single-season home run record. The race 
to break the record first attracted media attention as the home run leader 
changed often throughout the season. On August 19, Sosa hit his 48th home 
run to move ahead of McGwire. However, later that day McGwire hit his 48th 
and 49th home runs to regain the lead. On September 8, 1998, McGwire hit 
a pitch by the Cubs' Steve Trachsel over the left field wall for his record-breaking 
62nd home run, setting off massive celebrations at Busch Stadium. The fact 
that the game was against the Cubs meant that Sosa was able to congratulate 
McGwire personally on his achievement. Members of Maris' family were also 
present at the game. The ball was freely, albeit controversially, given 
to McGwire in a ceremony on the field by the stadium worker who found it. 
McGwire finished the 1998 season with 70 home runs (including five in his 
last three games), four ahead of Sosa's 66, a record that was broken three 
seasons later in 2001 by Barry Bonds with 73. McGwire was honored with 
the inaugural Babe Ruth Home Run Award for leading MLB in home runs.[17] 
Although McGwire had the prestige of the home run record, Sammy Sosa (who 
had fewer HR but more RBI and stolen bases) won the 1998 NL MVP award, 
as his contributions helped propel the Cubs to the playoffs (the Cardinals 
in 1998 finished third in the NL Central). Many credited the Sosa-McGwire 
home run chase in 1998 with "saving baseball", by both bringing in new, 
younger fans and bringing back old fans soured by the 1994–95 Major League 
Baseball strike.[18] McGwire kept his high level of offensive production 
from 1998 going in 1999 while setting or extending several significant 
records. For the fourth consecutive season, he led MLB in HR with 65. It 
was also his fourth consecutive season with at least 50 HR, extending his 
own major league record. Sosa, who hit 63 HR in 1999, again trailed McGwire. 
Thus, they became the first – and still only – players in major league 
history to hit 60 or more home runs in consecutive seasons. McGwire also 
set a record from 1998 to 1999 for home runs in a two-season period with 
135. Further, he owned the highest four-season HR total, with 245 from 
1996 to 1999. In 1999, he drove in an NL-leading 147 runs while only having 
145 hits, the highest RBI-per-hit tally for a season in baseball history. 
Statistically in 2000 and 2001, McGwire's numbers declined relative to 
previous years as McGwire struggled to avoid injury (32 HR in 89 games, 
and 29 HR in 97 games, respectively). He retired after the 2001 season.[19] 
After his playing career ended, McGwire demonstrated coaching ability, 
personally assisting players such as Matt Holliday, Bobby Crosby and Skip 
Schumaker before accepting an official role as hitting coach with a MLB 
team. On October 26, 2009, Tony La Russa, then manager of the Cardinals, 
confirmed that McGwire would become the club's fifth hitting coach of his 
tenure with the Cardinals, replacing Hal McRae.[20] McGwire received a 
standing ovation prior to the Cardinals home opener on April 12, 2010.[21] 
In his three seasons as Cardinals hitting coach, they featured a prolific 
offense that led the National League in hitting and on-base percentage, 
and were second in runs.[22] In early November, 2012, McGwire rejected 
a contract extension to return as Cardinals hitting coach for the 2013 
season. Instead, he accepted an offer for the same position with the Los 
Angeles Dodgers,[23] in order to be closer to his wife and five children.[24] 
On June 11, 2013, McGwire was ejected for the first time as a coach during 
a bench-clearing brawl with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[25] He was suspended 
for two games starting the next day. On December 2, 2015, he was named 
the new bench coach for the San Diego Padres. Probably best known as one 
of the top sluggers of his era, McGwire ended his career with 583 home 
runs, which was fifth-most in history when he retired. When he hit his 
500th career home run in 1999, he did so in 5,487 career at bats, the fewest 
in major league history.[5] He led all MLB in home runs in five different 
seasons, including 1987 and each season from 1996 to 1999. Totaling 245 
home runs from 1996−99, it was the highest four-season home run output 
in major league history. Further, in each of those four seasons, he exceeded 
50 home runs, becoming the first player to do so. He was also the first 
player to hit 49 or more home runs five times, including his rookie-season 
record of 49 in 1987. With a career average of one home every 10.6 at-bats, 
he is the leader in major league history for frequency of home runs.[4] 
As of 2015, McGwire owned three of the four lowest single-season AB/HR 
ratios in MLB history, which covered his 1996, 1998 and 1999 seasons. They 
were actually the top three seasons in MLB history until Bonds broke his 
single-season HR record in 2001. McGwire's 1997 season ranked 13th.[26] 
Considered one of the slowest running players in the game, McGwire had 
the fewest career triples (six) of any player with 5,000 or more at-bats, 
and had just 12 stolen bases while being caught stealing eight times. In 
1999, The Sporting News released a list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, 
ranking McGwire at number 91. The list had been compiled during the 1998 
season and included statistics through the 1997 season. That year, he was 
elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2005, The Sporting 
News published an update of their list, and McGwire had been moved up to 
Number 84. McGwire first became eligible for Hall of Fame voting in 2007. 
For election, a player needs to be listed on 75% of ballots cast; falling 
under 5% removes a player from future consideration. Between 2007 and 2010 
McGwire's performance held steady, receiving 128 votes (23.5%) in 2007, 
128 votes (23.6%) in 2008, 118 votes (21.9%) in 2009, and 128 votes (23.7%) 
in 2010. The subsequent ballot in 2011 showed the first sub-20% total of 
115 votes (19.8%), and McGwire's total votes continued to decline (112 
votes (19.5%) in 2012, 96 votes (16.9%) in 2013, 63 votes (11.0%) in 2014, 
and 55 votes (10.0%) in 2015) until he was finally eliminated after receiving 
only 54 votes (12.3%) in 2016.[27] A portion of Interstate 70 (see also: 
Interstate 70 in Missouri) in St. Louis and near Busch Stadium was named 
"Mark McGwire Highway" to honor his 70 home run achievement, along with 
his various good works for the city. In May 2010, St. Louis politicians 
succeeded in passing a state bill to change the name of "Mark McGwire Highway", 
a 5-mile stretch of Interstate 70, to "Mark Twain Highway".[28] McGwire 
became famously paired with other prominent sluggers at different periods 
of his playing career, most notably with José Canseco, Sammy Sosa, and 
Barry Bonds. As teammates with the Oakland Athletics, Canseco and McGwire, 
who played together from 1986 to until Canseco's trade to the Texas Rangers 
in 1992, became nationally publicized as the "Bash Brothers." Forming the 
power-hitting core of a potent Athletics lineup, they won back-to-back 
American Rookie of the Year Awards from 1986–87, combined for 11 All-Star 
appearances (McGwire six appearances, Canseco five), three major league 
home run titles (Canseco twice, McGwire once), and led the American League 
in slugging percentage three times (McGwire twice, Canseco once). They 
also combined for four 40-home run seasons, ten 30-HR seasons, eight 100-RBI 
seasons, five seasons with an OPS over .900, and seven with an OPS+ of 
140 or higher. Besides their outstanding home run power, they were even 
more dangerous with McGwire's strike zone discipline and Canseco's speed 
on the basepaths. In each full season from 1987 to 1992, McGwire walked 
no fewer than 71 times, including leading the major leagues with 110 in 
1990. Meanwhile, Canseco famously became the first member of the 40–40 
club in 1988, stealing 40 bases while hitting 42 home runs. He also garnered 
15 or more stolen bases four other seasons in his years playing with McGwire. 
The A's appeared in three straight ALCS from 1988–90 and won four AL West 
division titles in all seasons with the pair on the team. They both won 
their first World Series rings in 1989 when the A's defeated the Giants. 
Already staged by the historic Cubs–Cardinals rivalry, one of the greatest 
rivalries of individual hitters in major league history commenced in 1998 
with Sosa's and McGwire's chase of Maris' home runs record. Along with 
the home run chase, they combined for several other notable major league 
records and achievements. Not only were McGwire and Sosa the top two National 
League home run hitters in both 1998 and 1999, but there were also top 
two in all Major League Baseball in those two years. Further, they put 
on the two greatest two-season and four-season home run outputs in major 
league history. In 1998 and 1999, McGwire hit 135 while Sosa had 129. Although 
McGwire hit 245 home runs from 1996 to 1999, Sosa's four-year total from 
1998 to 2001 was closer at 243. So far, Babe Ruth, McGwire and Sosa are 
the only hitters with four 50+ home runs seasons, with McGwire and Sosa 
being the only ones with five of 49 or more. Although McGwire has two 60-HR 
season, Sosa holds the distinction of being the only major leaguer with 
three (1998, 1999 and 2001). Sosa won the 1998 NL MVP in 1998 while McGwire 
finished runner-up. The offensive surges helped to translate to moderate 
playoff success for both clubs. The Cubs won the NL wild card in 1998 for 
their only appearance in that period. The Cardinals were more successful, 
appearing in the playoffs in 2000 and 2001, and advancing to the NLCS in 
2000. However, neither club won the World Series in this time, and 2000–01 
were also the last two seasons of McGwire's playing career. Due in part 
to injuries, he was much less effective than in years past. Bonds' rivalry 
with McGwire was a two-part rivalry, but less directly competitive than 
was McGwire's rivalry with Sosa. It was more of formality when it commenced 
with Bonds signing as a free agent with the Giants prior to the 1993 season, 
thus joining the Bay Bridge rivaly involving the A's and the Giants. Both 
were considered the prime power hitters of their respective teams, and 
thus, of the Bay Area. Their Bay Area connection endured until McGwire 
was traded to the Cardinals in 1997. Four years later, the last season 
of McGwire's career, Bonds took center stage in the baseball world as he 
broke McGwire's single-season home run record. At this point, McGwire was 
unable to effectively participate in another home run chase due to injury 
and appeared in just 97 games. In spite of the 1989 World Series featuring 
the A's and Giants, McGwire's and Bonds' teams never faced each other in 
the playoffs, as Bonds played for the Pittsburgh Pirates that year. The 
closest playoff implication for the pair was in 2001 when the Cardinals 
finished three games ahead of the Giants for the NL wild card, eliminating 
the Giants from playoff contention just before the end of the season. † 
– tied with Sammy Sosa †† – tied with Babe Ruth and Sammy Sosa In 16 seasons 
playing major league baseball (1986–2001), McGwire accumulated the following 
career totals:[7] In a 1998 article by Associated Press writer Steve Wilstein, 
McGwire confessed to taking androstenedione,[29] an over-the-counter muscle 
enhancement product that had already been banned by the World Anti-Doping 
Agency, the NFL, and the IOC. At the time, however, use of the substance 
was not prohibited by Major League Baseball and it was not federally classified 
as an anabolic steroid in the United States until 2004.[30] Jose Canseco 
released a book, Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball 
Got Big, in 2005. In it, he wrote positively about steroids and made various 
claims—among them, that McGwire had used performance-enhancing drugs since 
the 1980s and that Canseco had personally injected him with them. In 2005, 
McGwire and Canseco were among 11 baseball players and executives subpoenaed 
to testify at a congressional hearing on steroids. During his testimony 
on March 17, 2005, McGwire declined to answer questions under oath when 
he appeared before the House Government Reform Committee. In a tearful 
opening statement, McGwire said: Asking me or any other player to answer 
questions about who took steroids in front of television cameras will not 
solve the problem. If a player answers 'No,' he simply will not be believed; 
if he answers 'Yes,' he risks public scorn and endless government investigations ... 
My lawyers have advised me that I cannot answer these questions without 
jeopardizing my friends, my family, and myself. I will say, however, that 
it remains a fact in this country that a man, any man, should be regarded 
as innocent unless proven guilty.[31] On January 11, 2010, McGwire admitted 
to using steroids on and off for a decade and said, "I wish I had never 
touched steroids. It was foolish and it was a mistake. I truly apologize. 
Looking back, I wish I had never played during the steroid era."[32] He 
admitted using them in the 1989/90 offseason and then after he was injured 
in 1993. He admitted using them on occasion throughout the 1990s, including 
during the 1998 season. McGwire said that he used steroids to recover from 
injuries.[33] McGwire's decision to admit using steroids was prompted by 
his decision to become hitting coach of the St. Louis Cardinals. According 
to McGwire, he took steroids for health reasons rather than to improve 
performance; however, a drug dealer who claimed to have provided steroids 
to McGwire asserted that his use was to improve his size and strength, 
rather than to just maintain his health.[34] McGwire's brother Dan McGwire 
was a quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks and Miami Dolphins of the NFL 
in the early 1990s, and was a first-round draft choice out of San Diego 
State University. He has another brother, Jay McGwire, who wrote a book 
in 2010 detailing their shared steroid use.[35] McGwire married Stephanie 
Slemer — a former pharmaceutical sales representative from the St. Louis 
area — in Las Vegas on April 20, 2002. On June 1, 2010, their triplet girls 
were born: Monet Rose, Marlo Rose, and Monroe Rose. They join brothers 
Max and Mason. They reside in a gated community in Shady Canyon Irvine, 
California.[36] Together they created the Mark McGwire Foundation for Children 
to support agencies that help children who have been sexually and physically 
abused come to terms with a difficult childhood. Mark has a son, Matthew 
b.1987, from a previous marriage (1984–1990, divorced) to Kathleen Hughes. 
Prior to admitting to using steroids, McGwire avoided the media and spent 
much of his free time playing golf.[37] He also worked as a hitting coach 
for Major League players Matt Holliday, Bobby Crosby, Chris Duncan and 
Skip Schumaker.[38] McGwire appeared as himself in season 7, episode 13 
of the sitcom Mad About You.[39] McGwire provided his voice for an episode 
of The Simpsons titled "Brother's Little Helper", where he played himself.
