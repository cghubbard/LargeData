The New York Yankees' 1995 season was the 93rd season for the Yankees, 
their 71st playing home games at Yankee Stadium. Managed by Buck Showalter, 
the team finished with a record of 79-65, seven games behind the Boston 
Red Sox. They won the first American League Wild Card. In the playoffs, 
they would lose a 2-0 series lead and succumb to the Mariners in the fifth 
game. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Infielders 
Manager Coaches Shortly before his death, Mantle videotaped a message to 
be played on Old-Timers' Day, which he was too ill to attend. He said, 
"When I die, I wanted on my tombstone, 'A great teammate.' But I didn't 
think it would be this soon." The words were indeed carved on the plaque 
marking his resting place at the family mausoleum in Dallas. Mantle received 
a liver transplant at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, on June 
8, 1995, after his liver had been damaged by years of chronic alcoholism, 
cirrhosis and hepatitis C. In July, he had recovered enough to deliver 
a press conference at Baylor, and noted that many fans had looked to him 
as a role model. "This is a role model: Don't be like me", he said. He 
also established the Mickey Mantle Foundation to raise awareness for organ 
donations. Soon, he was back in the hospital, where it was found that his 
liver cancer spread throughout his body. Mickey Mantle died on August 13, 
1995, at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. He was 63 years old. 
During the first Yankee home game after Mantle's passing, Eddie Layton 
played "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" on the Hammond organ at Yankee Stadium 
because Mickey had once told him it was his favorite song. The Yankees 
played the rest of the season with black mourning bands topped by a small 
number 7 on their left sleeves. Phil Rizzuto, angered over the refusal 
of television station WPIX to give him a day off to attend his former teammate's 
funeral, abruptly resigned from his play-by-play announcing job with the 
station on August 19. He would return to call a partial schedule for the 
station in 1996 before retiring for good. Note: Pos = Position; G = Games
