The 1986 Minnesota Twins finished a 71-91, sixth in the AL West. 1,255,453 
fans attended Twins games, the second lowest total in the American League. 
On May 30, Roy Smalley homered from both sides of the plate, the first 
Twin to do so. Only one Twins player made the All-Star Game, outfielder 
Kirby Puckett. On August 1, Puckett hit for the cycle, the only time he'd 
do so in his major league career. Going triple, double, single, homer, 
he became the seventh Twin in history to cycle. On the same night, pitcher 
Bert Blyleven struck out Oakland's Mike Davis to notch his 3000th strikeout. 
Only eight other pitchers had reached that plateau. After a disappointing 
start, manager Ray Miller was replaced by Tom Kelly on September 12. In 
a game against the Chicago White Sox held on October 4, Greg Gagne of the 
Twins hit two inside-the-park home runs in one game.[7] Pitcher Bert Blyleven 
was on the mound for the Twins; the last time a batter had hit two inside-the-park 
homers in one game, it was Dick Allen of the Chicago White Sox on July 
31, 1972, and his homers were hit off Blyleven. Also on October 4, Blyleven 
allowed his 50th home run of the season (to Chicago's Daryl Boston) to 
set a major league record. (When he serves up 46 in 1987, he'll set another 
record with 96 homers allowed over consecutive seasons.) Kirby Puckett, 
switched from leadoff to third in the batting order, blasted 31 HR drove 
in 96 runs and scored 119. Kent Hrbek hit .267 with 29 HR and 91 RBI. Tom 
Brunansky hit 23 HR and 75 RBI. Gary Gaetti hit .287 with 34 HR and 108 
RBI. With Roy Smalley's 20 home runs, five players reached 20 homers this 
season, the first time that's happened since six players topped 20 in 1964. 
The Twins had three solid starting pitchers: Frank Viola (16-13), Bert 
Blyleven (17-14), and Mike Smithson (13-14). Reliever Keith Atherton had 
10 saves. Third baseman Gary Gaetti and center fielder Kirby Puckett each 
won their first Gold Glove Award. They were the first Twins to win a gold 
glove since Jim Kaat in 1973. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]
