Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI) is a youth baseball program operated 
by Major League Baseball. This youth initiative is designed to provide 
young people from underserved and diverse communities the opportunity to 
play baseball and softball. The program was created by John Young in 1989 
in Los Angeles, and now serves more than 200 communities. Working as a 
scout for the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB) following his 
playing career, John Young noticed a lack of African American prospects. 
While working for the Baltimore Orioles, he surveyed prospects selected 
in the 1986 MLB Draft, many of whom attended four-year colleges, and then 
noticed that among California colleges, 4% of players were African American 
and less than 3% were Hispanic. He presented his findings to Orioles' general 
manager Roland Hemond and MLB Commissioner Peter Ueberroth. Ueberroth contacted 
Tom Bradley, the mayor of Los Angeles, who agreed to fund a youth baseball 
program in Los Angeles, providing $50,000.[1][2] Young also received funding 
from the Amateur Athletic Union.[3] Young, with the Professional Baseball 
Scouts of Southern California, organized 12 teams of 180 13- and 14-year-olds 
in 1989, the first year of the RBI program.[1] Darryl Strawberry and Eric 
Davis, African American baseball players from Southern California, devoted 
time and money to help the program.[2] MLB took over operation of the RBI 
program in 1991.[4] By 1992, the RBI program expanded to Harlem, St. Louis, 
and Kansas City.[3] Leonard S. Coleman, Jr., the former president of the 
National League, took over operation in the program in 1994, and forged 
a working alliance with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America to help grow 
the RBI program.[5][6] The RBI program has received support from KPMG, 
the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation, Louisville Slugger, New Balance, Rawlings, 
Wilson Sporting Goods, and Outdoor Cap.[4] Teams compete in three divisions: 
the Junior Boys division (13 to 15 years of age), the Senior Boys division 
(16 to 18 years of age), and Girls Softball (up to 18 years of age).[7] 
League schedules run from May through August.[4] Teams compete in regional 
tournaments in order to compete in the RBI World Series, which began in 
1993.[8] The RBI World Series is aired on the MLB Network and can be streamed 
on MLB.com, starting in 2010.[9] As of 2013, RBI operates over 300 programs 
in over 200 cities, with over 200,000 participants. Programs run in the 
United States, Canada, the Caribbean, and South America.[10] MLB provides 
college scholarships to RBI participants.[11] A Junior RBI program serves 
children from the ages of 6 through 12, which was launched in 2009.[12] 
The number of African American players in MLB has declined in recent years. 
No member of the 2005 Houston Astros, who played in the 2005 World Series, 
was African American.[13] The percentage of African American players on 
Opening Day rosters has dropped from 19% in 1995 to 8.5% in 2013, leading 
to MLB opening a task force.[14][15] Recently retired commissioner Bud 
Selig made it imperative that we get African American youth back into baseball.[16] 
Rachel Robinson, widow of Jackie Robinson, has praised the efforts of the 
RBI program to reach out to African American youth.[17] Alumni of the RBI 
program include major leaguers CC Sabathia, Jimmy Rollins, Coco Crisp, 
James Loney, Carl Crawford, B. J. Upton, Justin Upton, Julio Borbon, Efren 
Navarro, Ricky Romero, Yovani Gallardo, Chris Young, and James McDonald, 
as well as MLB draftees Trevor Reckling, Victor Roache, J. P. Crawford,
