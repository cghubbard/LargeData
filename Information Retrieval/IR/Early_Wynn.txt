Early Wynn Jr. (January 6, 1920 – April 4, 1999), nicknamed "Gus", was 
an American Major League Baseball (MLB) right-handed pitcher. He pitched 
for the Washington Senators, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox during 
his 23-year major league career. He was identified as one of the most intimidating 
pitchers in the game with his powerful fastball combined with a hard attitude 
towards batters. Wynn was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972. 
Wynn was born in Alabama and signed with the Senators at the age of 17, 
deciding to pursue baseball instead of finishing high school. He spent 
a couple of seasons in the minor leagues, had a brief major league stint 
in 1939, returned to the major leagues in 1941 and pitched his first full 
MLB season in 1942. He missed the 1945 MLB season and a portion of the 
next season while serving in the United States Army during the latter part 
of World War II. Wynn was a member of one of baseball's best pitching rotations 
along with Bob Feller, Mike Garcia, and Bob Lemon, while with the Indians 
in the mid-1950s. He won the 1959 Cy Young Award, beginning to rely on 
the knuckleball as the velocity of his pitches declined. Wynn retired in 
1963. He finished with exactly 300 career wins; he had spent several months 
in pursuit of his 300th win. Wynn served as a coach and broadcaster in 
the major leagues after his retirement as a player. In 1999, he was included 
on The Sporting News list of the 100 greatest players in baseball history. 
He died that year in an assisted living facility following heart related 
problems and a stroke. Wynn was born in Hartford, Alabama, the son of Blanche 
Wynn and Early Wynn Sr., an automobile mechanic and former semipro baseball 
player. He excelled at both football and baseball in high school. As a 
sophomore, Wynn was about to become the top running back at his school 
when he suffered a broken leg on a punt return. The injury forced him out 
of football and focused his attention on baseball. Wynn later described 
it as "my best break ever."[1] When he was a teenager, Wynn attended a 
tryout session in Florida for the Washington Senators. He impressed Senators 
coach Clyde Milan enough that the organization offered him a minor league 
contract.[2] Wynn signed with Washington for $100 per month and decided 
not to finish high school.[3] Between 1937 and 1939, Wynn pitched minor 
league baseball in the Florida State League and the Piedmont League.[4] 
Wynn made his MLB debut in 1939, appearing in only three games before returning 
to the minor leagues for 1940. He made it back to the major leagues in 
1941, starting five games, completing four of them and finishing with a 
3-1 win-loss record.[5] Wynn was named to Washington's four-man pitching 
rotation in 1942.[2] He pitched 30 games that season, finishing with a 
10-16 record and a 5.12 earned run average (ERA). The next season, in 37 
games, he finished 18-12 with a 2.91 ERA. He led the league in losses in 
1944, compiling an 8-17 record.[5] Wynn joined the United States Army in 
1944, going to the Philippines to serve in World War II.[4] Though he missed 
the 1945 major league season, Wynn played with a Pacific Army team known 
as the Manila Dodgers.[6] He returned to the United States in June 1946 
and rejoined the Senators.[7] In 17 games that year, he finished with an 
8-5 record. He pitched 33 games the next year and earned a decision in 
almost every game, totaling 17 wins with 15 losses. Wynn made the 1947 
AL All-Star squad (did not pitch)[8] for the first time as a replacement 
for an injured Bob Feller. In 1948, Wynn struggled to an 8-19 record with 
a 5.82 ERA, giving up a league-high 128 earned runs.[5] In a December 1948 
trade, Wynn and Mickey Vernon were sent to the Cleveland Indians in exchange 
for Joe Haynes, Ed Klieman and Eddie Robinson.[5] A month earlier, the 
Boston Red Sox had offered Johnny Pesky to Washington for Wynn, but the 
trade did not go through.[9] The Indians' pitching coach and former star 
pitcher Mel Harder taught him how to throw a curveball, slider, changeup 
and knuckleball. Wynn assimilated Harder's lessons easily, and after his 
1949 season adjustment, the next year he recorded 18 wins and led the AL 
with a 3.20 ERA. Between 1950 and 1956, Wynn won at least 17 games per 
season. His first 20-win season came in 1951.[5] By that time he had become 
part of one of the greatest pitching rotations in MLB history, joining 
Bob Feller, Bob Lemon and Mike Garcia. Manager Al López later called those 
four pitchers "the greatest pitching staff I ever saw during 33 years in 
the majors."[10] In 1954, Wynn posted a 2.73 ERA, won 23 games and struck 
out 155 batters. The team went to the 1954 World Series; Wynn pitched one 
game and the Indians were defeated by the New York Giants in four straight 
games.[11] After suffering from pneumonia at the beginning of the 1955 
season, Wynn earned his first win in May.[12] He was an All-Star for the 
second time in his career and pitched 3 scoreless innings in the game; 
this selection marked the start of six consecutive All-Star seasons.[13] 
He finished the 1955 season with a 17-11 record and a 2.82 ERA.[5] In a 
1956 game, he was struck in the face by a sharp line drive off the bat 
of Washington Senators shortstop Jose Valdivielso. He did not leave the 
game immediately, later realizing he had lost seven teeth. The facial wound 
required 16 stitches.[14] In 1957, Wynn became the second pitcher in major 
league history to win a game by a score of 1-0 while recording at least 
ten strikeouts and hitting a home run.[15] Wynn was traded to the Chicago 
White Sox after the 1957 season. Wynn and Al Smith were exchanged for Minnie 
Miñoso and Fred Hatfield.[5] In 1958 Wynn became the first MLB pitcher 
to lead his league in strikeouts in consecutive years with different teams 
(184 with Cleveland, 189 with Chicago). He won the Cy Young Award in 1959 
at the age of 39, posting a record of 22–10, with 179 strikeouts and a 
3.16 ERA which helped lead the White Sox (sometimes called The Pale Hose) 
to the AL pennant championship. He was the third oldest MLB pitcher to 
win 20 games in a season, following Cy Young and Grover Cleveland Alexander.[16] 
He also was the starting pitcher in the first of two All-Star Games held 
in 1959 (MLB held two All-Star Games from 1959 through 1962).[17] Wynn 
began throwing a knuckleball in 1959 after his fastball began to lose velocity. 
"For years they've been accusing me of throwing it when I didn't even know 
how to hold it ... I can't throw as hard as I did six, seven years ago. 
And I get tired quicker. I find that you can throw the knuckler with a 
little more effort and no strain", Wynn said.[18] In the 1950s Wynn had 
more strikeouts (1,544) than any other pitcher in the majors and was quite 
capable with the bat as well. A switch hitter, Wynn batted .214 (365 for 
1704), with 17 home runs and 173 RBI.[5] His 90 pinch-hit appearances included 
a grand slam, making him one of five MLB pitchers to record a grand slam 
as a pinch-hitter. In 1960, Wynn was an All-Star for the seventh and last 
time (7 seasons)[19] and pitched two scoreless innings in the second All-Star 
Game held that season (his 9th All-Star game).[20] He finished the 1960 
season 13-12. In 1961, he was 8-2 but his season ended in July because 
of gout that caused persistent pain in his arm and legs. He pitched to 
a 7-15 record in 1962, having shifted mostly to pitching with the slider 
and knuckleball. His last win of that season was his 299th career victory. 
Wynn had previously expressed his desire to get to 300 career wins.[4] 
Wynn returned to Cleveland in 1963 for a last run. In that season, he won 
his 300th game, after failing to collect the milestone win in seven starts 
over nine months in 1962–63. Both the timeframe and the number of attempts 
are the longest between any pitcher's 299th and 300th wins in MLB history. 
Opposing Kansas City batter Ed Charles recalled Wynn's 300th win: "His 
fastball, if it reached 80, that was stretching it. He was laboring, throwing 
nothing but bloopers and junk."[21] Long after his retirement, which came 
at the end of the 1963 season, Wynn reflected on his 300th win and said 
that he was not proud of the milestone. "If I had pitched a good game and 
gone nine innings, that would be something. But that's not the way it was", 
Wynn said.[22] He left the game with a 5-4 lead after pitching five innings. 
"Jerry Walker relieved me and saved the game for me. He was my roommate 
and pitched like a man possessed", Wynn recalled.[22] Wynn said that he 
had been awake all night before the game, suffering from pain related to 
the gout that had long affected him.[3] Wynn was the last active major 
leaguer who played in the 1930s, becoming one of only 29 players in baseball 
history to have appeared in major league games in four decades. His durability 
helped him lead the American League in innings three times (1951, 1954, 
1959) and propelled him to an AL record for most years pitched (23). Wynn 
won an even 300 games. He registered five 20-win seasons, 2,334 strikeouts, 
290 complete games, 49 shutouts, and 4,556 innings pitched in 691 games.[5] 
Wynn became the pitching coach for the Indians in 1964. Several of his 
players – including Sam McDowell, Sonny Siebert, Luis Tiant and Steve Hargan 
– were still with the team in 1967 when they set a record for team strikeouts 
in a season. In August 1965, Wynn flirted with the idea of making a comeback 
as a knuckleball pitcher.[23] Wynn left Cleveland after the 1966 season 
and joined the Minnesota Twins as pitching coach.[24] He later served as 
a minor league manager for the Twins.[14] He advocated for better pensions 
for retired baseball players.[25] In 1972, the team considered activating 
the 52-year-old Wynn to pitch one inning if retired star Ted Williams would 
hit against him. The move would have made Wynn the first player to pitch 
in five different decades, but Williams was not interested and the team 
dropped the idea.[26] Wynn had first proposed the idea of a one-game comeback 
to the Twins in 1970.[27] From 1977 to 1980, he provided the color commentary 
for radio broadcasts of Toronto Blue Jays games, working alongside Tom 
Cheek. He also provided color commentary for Chicago White Sox radio broadcasts 
in 1982 and 1983. When he was replaced by Lorn Brown in December 1983, 
White Sox president Eddie Einhorn described Wynn as "a link to baseball's 
past."[28] Wynn married Mabel Allman in 1939. She was killed in a car accident 
in 1942. They had one child together; Wynn's relatives helped to raise 
him. He married Lorraine Follin in the fall of 1944, around the time he 
entered the United States Army. They later had a daughter.[4] In the mid 
to late 1960s, the pitcher owned the Early Wynn Steak House and Bowling 
Lanes in Venice, Florida.[29] Wynn was elected to the Baseball Hall of 
Fame in 1972 along with Sandy Koufax and Yogi Berra. He was grateful, although 
he expressed disappointment that he had not received the required votes 
on his first three ballots.[30] In the last years of his life, Wynn suffered 
a heart attack and a stroke. He moved to an assisted living facility in 
Venice, Florida, where he died in April 1999.[31] His wife of 50 years 
had died five years earlier.[32] In 1999, Wynn ranked Number 100 on The 
Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,[33] According 
to the Baseball-Reference.com, Wynn is the "most linkable" player in baseball 
history. This means that if a value of 1 is assigned to any player Wynn 
played on the same team with, and a value of 2 assigned to any player who 
played on the same team with a player with a value of 1, and so on, and 
the mean value is found by considering each player in baseball history, 
Wynn's value is lower than any other player's. Wynn was remembered for 
his toughness and for the frequency with which he threw at batters. He 
once stated, "I'd knock down my own grandmother if she dug in on me."[34] 
He also said to reporters: "Why should I worry about hitters? Do they worry 
about me? Do you ever find a hitter crying because he's hit a line drive 
through the box? My job is getting hitters out. If I don't get them out 
I lose. I don't like losing a game any more than a salesman likes losing 
a big sale. I've got a right to knock down anybody holding a bat."[35] 
When he was then asked whether he would have the same opinion if the batter 
were his own mother, he paused and responded, "Mother was a pretty good 
curveball hitter."[36] In fact, when Wynn was with the Indians, he actually 
threw a pitch at his own 15-year-old son, Joe. Wynn was throwing pre-game 
batting practice to Joe, and Joe hit two long drives in a row. Ushers in 
the nearly empty stadium began to clap. Moments later, Joe was lying flat 
on his back in the batting cage, frightened by his father's knockdown pitch. 
Wynn said later, "He was leaning in on me, and I had to show him who was 
boss."[37] His attitude was encouraged early in his career by manager Bucky 
Harris, who ordered Wynn to throw brushback pitches when he got two strikes 
on a batter. Otherwise he faced a $25 fine. "I was making $350 a month. 
I couldn't afford giving up $25", Wynn said.[3] Whenever an opposing batter 
would line one of his pitches back toward the mound, Wynn would retaliate 
by throwing a brushback pitch at the batter the next time the batter faced 
him.[38] In 1962, when Wynn was with the White Sox, he was throwing batting 
practice and his teammate Joe Cunningham hit a line drive that missed Wynn 
by inches. Wynn responded by throwing three straight pitches under his 
teammate's chin.[36] Whenever one of his teammates was knocked down by 
an opposing pitcher, Wynn would retaliate by knocking down two of the opposing 
pitcher's teammates.[36] According to Rod Carew, Wynn's competitiveness 
did not end when his playing career did. "Early would knock you down in 
batting practice. If you hit a ball good off of him, he'd knock you down 
and then challenge you. He told you to expect it when you stepped in the
