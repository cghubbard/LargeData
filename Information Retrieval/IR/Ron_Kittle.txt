Ronald Dale (Ron) Kittle (born January 5, 1958) is a former left fielder 
and designated hitter in Major League Baseball. He was known for his home 
run hitting power, in particular line-drive rooftop home runs (7, an MLB 
record) at Comiskey Park, and was named the 1983 AL Rookie of the Year. 
From 1982 through 1991, Kittle played for the Chicago White Sox (1982–86, 
1989, 1991), New York Yankees (1986–87), Cleveland Indians (1988) and Baltimore 
Orioles (1990). He batted and threw right-handed. Kittle was also a manager 
for the minor league Schaumburg Flyers. A former steelworker who made his 
major league debut at nearly 25 years old, Kittle was a popular player 
on the 1983 "Winnin Ugly" Chicago White Sox when they won 99 games and 
made their first playoff appearance since the 1959 World Series. That season, 
Kittle was selected an All-Star and won Rookie of the Year honors after 
hitting 35 home runs (club record for a rookie) and 100 RBI. Kittle also 
hit 50 homers in the minor leagues with the Edmonton Trappers and has his 
jersey retired in Edmonton at Telus Field. Kittle maintained his home run 
power, but after 1983 his batting average declined and his strikeouts increased. 
Kittle left the White Sox after 1986 and played one season each for the 
New York Yankees (1987) and Cleveland Indians (1988). He briefly returned 
again to the White Sox in 1990, playing first base. Later in the season 
he was dealt to the Baltimore Orioles. He returned to the White Sox again 
and finished his career in Chicago in 1991. In ten seasons, Kittle posted 
a .239 batting average with 176 home runs and 460 RBI in 843 games. In 
1998, Kittle was hired as the first manager of the non-affiliated minor 
league Schaumburg Flyers of the Northern League. During the early years 
of the Flyers franchise, Kittle did a series of TV commercials to promote 
the team, using the gimmick "Ma Kittle." where he played both himself and 
his "Ma Kittle." The ads were successful at sparking some initial interest 
in the team as the Flyers hoped to steal away fans from the nearby Kane 
County Cougars, then a Florida Marlins Class A team. The ad mimmicked the 
highly successful Converse ads where Larry Johnson starred as both himself 
and "Gramdmama." Kittle resigned his position in 2001. In March 2005, Kittle's 
book "Ron Kittle's Tales from the White Sox Dugout" was published. It was 
co-written with Bob Logan, who also co-wrote Michael Jordan's book "Come 
Fly with Me." The book features anecdotes (some of them never before told 
to the public) from his time as a major leaguer, mostly with the Sox. One 
story talked about the hilarity of Ozzie Guillén ordering dinner while 
Kittle, Guillen and Cubs SS Shawon Dunston were out at a local restaurant. 
The book also caused some controversy when Barry Bonds of the San Francisco 
Giants accused Kittle of fabricating an insulting story about him, claiming 
he refused to sign autographs intended to help a children's charity in 
Chicago. The book says Bonds also made racially inappropriate statements. 
Kittle now builds custom collectible benches out of baseballs, bats, and 
bases. He additionally works in public relations for the White Sox and 
maintains a popular website and blog at RonKittle.com Ron Kittle married 
the former Laura Ann Cooke on October 19, 1984, at St. Mary of the Lake 
Catholic Church in Gary, Indiana. Both were students and friends at William 
A. Wirt High School in Gary, Indiana. They lived in Valparaiso until 2001 
when they moved to Chesterton.[1] Ron and Laura have two children, Dylan
