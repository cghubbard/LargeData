The "Core Four" are the former New York Yankees baseball players Derek 
Jeter, Andy Pettitte, Jorge Posada, and Mariano Rivera. All four players 
were drafted or originally signed as amateurs by the Yankees in the early 
1990s. They played together in the minor leagues, and made their Yankee 
major league debuts in 1995. Each of them was a key contributor to the 
Yankees' late-1990s dynasty that won four World Series championships in 
five years. By 2007, they were the only remaining Yankees from the franchise's 
dynasty of the previous decade. All four players were on the Yankees' active 
roster in 2009 when the team won the 2009 World Series—its fifth championship 
in the previous 14 years. Three members of the Core Four—Jeter, Rivera 
and Posada—played together for 17 consecutive years (1995–2011), longer 
than any other similar group in North American professional sports.[1] 
Pettitte had a sojourn away from the team when he played for the Houston 
Astros for three seasons, before returning to the Yankees in 2007. He retired 
after the 2010 season,[2] reducing the group to the so-called Key Three.[3] 
Posada followed suit after 2011, ending his 17-year career with the Yankees.[4] 
Pettitte came out of retirement prior to the 2012 season and played for 
two more years.[5] Both Pettitte and Rivera retired after the 2013 season, 
and Jeter retired after the 2014 season.[6] Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, 
Jorge Posada, and Andy Pettitte all joined the New York Yankees organization 
in the early 1990s as amateurs. Rivera signed as an international free 
agent in February 1990.[7] The Yankees selected Pettitte in the 22nd round 
and Posada in the 24th round of the 1990 Major League Baseball Draft. Jeter 
was selected in the first round, with the sixth overall selection, of the 
1992 Major League Baseball Draft.[8] Together, the Core Four progressed 
through the Yankees minor league system in the early 1990s. It was during 
their tenure with the Oneonta Yankees of the Class A-Short Season New York-Penn 
League in 1991 that Posada, initially an infielder, began catching for 
his future major league batterymate Pettitte.[9] The latter threw a knuckleball 
at the time, which Posada struggled to catch (hitting him mostly on the 
knee), prompting Pettitte to abandon the pitch.[9] Promoted to the Greensboro 
Hornets of the Class A South Atlantic League in 1992, Posada and Pettitte 
met Jeter, a highly regarded prospect, who had been assigned to the team. 
Posada and Pettitte initially questioned the hype surrounding Jeter, but 
soon recognized his talent and poise.[10] Rivera injured his elbow in 1992 
and had surgery in August to repair the damage. While Rivera was pitching 
for Greensboro in 1993 on a strict pitch count, Jeter kept track of the 
count from shortstop.[11] The four first played together with the Class 
AAA Columbus Clippers of the International League in 1994.[12] All four 
made their major league debuts in 1995.[13] Both Jeter and Rivera reached 
the major leagues in May, but were demoted back to the minors in June and 
bounced around between the minors and major leagues throughout the year.[9][14] 
Posada made his major league debut in September, and along with Pettitte 
and Rivera, was included on the Division Series roster.[14] Jeter, Posada, 
and Rivera played in the same MLB game for the first time on September 
28, 1996.[3] That season, Jeter, Pettitte and Rivera won their first championship 
together.[9] Jeter became the Yankees all-time hits leader on September 
11, 2009, with his 2,722nd hit, surpassing Lou Gehrig.[15] On July 9, 2011, 
against the Tampa Bay Rays, he collected his 3,000th hit,[16] becoming 
the 28th player to reach the milestone, the first Yankee to accomplish 
the feat and collect all 3,000 hits with the team,[17][18] the first player 
to reach the milestone with a New York team,[19] the fourth-youngest player 
to reach the mark,[20] the second to do it by hitting a home run, the second 
to reach the mark in a five-hit game,[19] and the first to attain the milestone 
playing shortstop exclusively.[21] Furthermore, Jeter broke Rickey Henderson's 
franchise record for stolen bases on May 28, 2011, when he stole his 327th 
base against the Mariners.[22] Jeter's third milestone in 2011 was breaking 
Mickey Mantle's record for most games played as a Yankee, accomplishing 
this on August 28, 2011 against the Orioles.[23] In 2000, he became the 
only player to win both the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award 
and the All-Star Game MVP in the same season.[24] Pettitte holds the all-time 
record for postseason victories, with 19 wins in total.[25] Among Yankees 
pitchers, he ranks first in strikeouts (2,011)[26] and third in wins (213).[27][28] 
He was named the 2001 American League Championship Series Most Valuable 
Player[29][30] and won the Warren Spahn Award in 2003 as the best left-handed 
pitcher in baseball.[31] His #46 was retired on 23rd August 2015 Posada 
is only the fifth major league catcher with at least 1,500 hits, 350 doubles, 
275 home runs, and 1,000 runs batted in (RBIs) in a career,[32] and the 
only major league catcher to ever record a .330 batting average or better 
with 40 doubles, 20 home runs, and 90 RBIs in a single season. He is only 
the second Yankees catcher to hit 30 home runs in a season, after Yogi 
Berra. Among Yankee catchers, Posada is first all-time in doubles (365),[33] 
walks (897),[34] and intentional walks (74),[35] and second in home runs 
(261)[36] and extra-base hits (636).[37] Among all Yankees players, Posada 
ranks sixth all-time in grand slams (10).[38] On April 16, 2009, Posada 
hit the first home run at the new Yankee Stadium.[39] His #20 was retired 
on August 22, 2015. Rivera played 19 seasons with the Yankees (1995–2013), 
serving as closer for 17 of them. He retired as MLB's career leader in 
saves (652) and games finished (952), having surpassed Trevor Hoffman in 
both categories in 2011.[40][41] Rivera's career earned run average (ERA) 
(2.21) and WHIP (1.00) are the lowest of any pitcher in the live-ball era.[42] 
In the postseason, he holds the MLB record for career saves (42) and ERA 
(0.71).[43] He also holds records for 15 consecutive seasons with 25 or 
more saves,[44] nine consecutive seasons with 30 or more saves, and 15 
seasons with 30 or more saves.[45][46] From 1996 through his final season 
in 2013, he posted an ERA under 3.00 in all but one season (2007).[43] 
Selected as an All-Star 13 times, he saved a record four All-Star Games, 
the last coming in 2009.[47] On May 25, 2011, he became the 15th pitcher 
in major league history to make 1,000 appearances, and the first to do 
so with a single team.[48][49] His appearances total ranks as the most 
in American League history.[50] On September 22, 2013, Rivera became the 
first active Yankee player to have his number retired by the organization; 
he was the last major league player to wear number 42 full-time, following 
its league-wide retirement in honor of Jackie Robinson.[51] In addition 
to winning five World Series championships, the Core Four won seven AL 
pennants and 11 AL East championships for the Yankees. Furthermore, the 
four have led the team to 15 postseason appearances in their 16 seasons 
with the Yankees (every season except for 2008).[52] Pettitte and Rivera 
hold the all-time record for most win–save combinations with 72;[53] Bob 
Welch and Dennis Eckersley previously held the record with 58.[54] In 2010, 
Rivera, Jeter, and Posada became the first trio in any of the four North 
American major sports leagues to play together on the same team for 16 consecutive 
seasons.[55] Posada and Jeter played their 1,660th game together on July 
14, 2011. This broke the record for most regular-season games played together 
by two Yankee teammates, previously held by Lou Gehrig and Tony Lazzeri.[56] 
With the rise of free agency and trades, many sportswriters believe that 
it is highly unlikely that another group of players of comparable size 
will spend their entire careers with a single team.[57][58] Buck Showalter, 
the Yankees manager during the Core Four's major league debuts in 1995, 
said, "[Y]ou won't see anything like this happen again. There are too many 
variables for that to ever happen again. And what you have to remember 
is the makeup of those guys. The common thread was their agenda. They didn't 
branch off. They didn't want to disappoint each other. They were guys who 
never wanted to let their teammates down."[14] Pettitte was the first player 
of the Core Four to retire, announcing his decision at a news conference 
at Yankee Stadium on February 4, 2011. He told the organization "not to 
count on his return" after the Yankees lost the 2010 American League Championship 
Series to the Texas Rangers, citing his desire to spend more time with 
his family.[59] After spending the 2011 season away from baseball, he served 
as a guest instructor for the Yankees during 2012 spring training and insisted 
that he was not considering a comeback.[60] However, he reversed his decision 
on his final day as instructor and rejoined the organization on March 16, 
signing a $2.5 million minor league contract.[61] He pitched in both the 
2012 and 2013 seasons for the Yankees before announcing his second retirement 
on September 20, 2013. Although he was initially not going to reveal his 
decision, it was at Rivera's insistence that he eventually did.[62] The 
Yankees held a ceremony for Pettitte five days later on September 25, with 
fellow Core Four members Jeter and Rivera presenting him with a framed 
base from his final Yankee Stadium start, signed by all his teammates.[63] 
He made his final appearance on September 28 against the Houston Astros, 
the only other team he had pitched for in his career. He pitched a complete 
game—his first since 2006—and by winning his last start, he finished the 
season with an 11–11 win–loss record. This preserved his records of never 
having a losing season throughout his 18-year career[64] and being the 
only pitcher in major league history to have 15 winning seasons (with a 
minimum of three starts each) without recording a losing season.[65] The 
second member of the group to retire was Posada. He endured a tumultuous 
2011 season that saw him lose the starting catcher job to Russell Martin, 
drop to 9th in the Yankee lineup after batting .165, bench himself, and 
then lose his spot in the lineup as the starting designated hitter altogether.[66][67] 
Posada had several memorable performances at the end of the year. He drove 
in the go-ahead runs that clinched the American League East title for the 
Yankees[68] and batted .429 in the 2011 American League Division Series 
against the Detroit Tigers. After the Yankees lost the series in Game 5, 
he cut short a postgame interview when he teared up, coming to the realization 
that it could have been his final game as a Yankee.[69] He announced his 
decision to retire on January 24, 2012.[70] Rivera had hinted during 2012 
spring training that the 2012 season would be his last, and confirmed that 
his decision was "irrevocable."[71][72] He intended to reveal his decision 
at the end of the year, preferring a low-key departure instead of having 
a farewell tour across MLB stadiums.[73] However, he reversed his decision 
after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and part of his meniscus 
while shagging fly balls on May 3, 2012.[74] This prematurely ended his 
season, and though there were fears that this could potentially be a career-ending 
injury,[74][75] he stated that he would return, declaring that he was "not 
going down like this."[76] After rehabilitating his injury through the 
offseason, Rivera announced on March 9 that he would retire at the end 
of the 2013 season.[77] His farewell tour saw him meet the fans and unsung 
employees of opposing teams during his final visit to their ballparks to 
listen to their stories and thank them for supporting baseball.[78] Each 
opposing team reciprocated the gesture by holding an on-field ceremony 
and honoring him with a parting gift.[79][80] On September 22, a day that 
was declared "Mariano Rivera Day" by the Mayor of New York City Michael 
Bloomberg, the Yankees held their own ceremony to honor Rivera, culminating 
in the retiring of his uniform number into Monument Park.[81] Many former 
teammates of his were in attendance, including Posada, who threw out the 
ceremonial first pitch to Rivera in a reversal of roles.[82] Jeter was 
the last player of the Core Four to retire, having announced on February 
12, 2014 that he would retire at the end of the 2014 season.[83] Rankings
