Metropolitan Manila[1][4] (Filipino: Kalakhang Maynila, Kamaynilaan), commonly 
known as Metro Manila or simply Manila, the National Capital Region (NCR) 
of the Philippines, is the seat of government, the 2nd most populous region 
of the country, and is the most densely populated region of the country. 
The National Capital Region is composed of Manila, the capital city of 
the country, Quezon City, the country's most populous city, the Municipality 
of Pateros, and the cities of Caloocan, Las Piñas, Makati, Malabon, Mandaluyong, 
Marikina, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Parañaque, Pasay, Pasig, San Juan, Taguig, 
and Valenzuela. The National Capital Region, with an area of 619.5 km2, 
has a population of 7007128772530000000♠12,877,253,[2] making it the most 
populous region in the Philippines, as well as the 9th most populous metropolitan 
area in Asia. The total urbanized area, referring to its continuous urban 
expansion into the provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, Rizal and Batangas, 
was listed as having a population of 7007241230000000000♠24,123,000 by 
Demographia,[5] making it the 4th most populous urban area in the world. 
These 5 provinces, plus Metro Manila and Pampanga, sum to 30.7 million 
residents as of the newly counted census of 2015.[2] The region is the 
center of culture, economy, education, and government of the Philippines. 
NCR is one of the 12 defined metropolitan areas in the Philippines according 
to the National Economic and Development Authority.[6] Designated as a 
global power city, NCR exerts a significant impact on commerce, finance, 
media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, 
both locally and internationally. It is the home to all the consulates 
and embassies in the Philippines, thereby making it an important center 
for international diplomacy in the country. Its economical power makes 
the region the country's premier center for finance and commerce. NCR accounts 
for 37.2% of the gross domestic product of the Philippines.[7] The region 
was established in 1975 through Presidential Decree No. 824 in response 
to the needs to sustain the growing population and for the creation for 
the center of political power and the seat of the Government of the Philippines.[8] 
The Province of Manila, the progenitor to the present-day Metro Manila, 
is one of the eight original provinces that revolted against the Spanish 
colonial rule in the Philippines. The province was honored as one of the 
sun rays in the Flag of the Philippines, with each of the eight sun rays 
symbolizing one of the eight revolutionary provinces. A historical province 
known as Manila encompasses the former pre-Hispanic kingdoms of Tondo and 
Maynila. It became the capital of the colonial Philippines, with Manila 
(Intramuros) serving as the center of colonial power. In 1898, it included 
the City of Manila and 23 other municipalities. Mariquina also served as 
the capital from 1898-1899, just as when the sovereignty of the Philippines 
was transferred to the United States. The province was dissolved and most 
of it was incorporated to the newly created province of Rizal in 1901. 
Since the Spanish colonial period, Manila was considered as one of the 
original global cities. The Manila galleon was the first known commercially 
traveled trade route that sail the Pacific for 250 years, bringing to Spain 
their cargoes of luxury goods, economic benefits, and cultural exchange. 
During the American period, at the time of the Philippine Commonwealth, 
American architect and urban designer Daniel Burnham was commissioned to 
create the grand Plan of Manila to be approved by the Philippine Government. 
The creation of Manila in 1901 is composed of the places and parishes of 
Binondo, Ermita, Intramuros, Malate, Manila, Pandacan, Quiapo, Sampaloc, 
San Andres, San Fernando de Dilao, San Miguel, San Nicolas, Santa Ana de 
Sapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Mesa and Tondo. Meanwhile, the towns and parishes 
of Caloocan, Las Piñas, Mariquina, Pasig, Parañaque, Malabon, Navotas, 
San Juan del Monte, San Pedro de Macati, San Felipe Neri, Muntinlupa and 
the Taguig-Pateros area were incorporated into the province of Rizal. Pasig 
serves as its provincial capital. In 1939, President Quezon established 
Quezon City with a goal to replace Manila as the capital city of the country. 
A masterplan for Quezon City was completed. The establishment of Quezon 
City meant demise of the grand Burnham Plan of Manila, with funds being 
diverted for the establishment of the new capital. World War II further 
resulted in the loss most of the developments in the Burnham Plan, but 
more importantly, the loss of more than 100,000 lives at the Battle of 
Manila in 1945. Later on, Quezon City eventually served as the national 
capital from 1948-1976. It was reinstated back to Manila through Presidential 
Decree No. 940 owing to its historical significance as the seat of government 
of the Philippines since the Spanish colonial period. Presidential Decree 
No. 940 states that Manila has always been to the Filipino people and in 
the eyes of the world, the premier city of the Philippines being the center 
of trade, commerce, education and culture.[9] During the war, President 
Manuel L. Quezon created the City of Greater Manila as an emergency measure, 
merging the cities of Manila and Quezon City, along with the municipalities 
of Caloocan, Las Piñas, Mariquina, Pasig, Parañaque, Malabon, Navotas, 
San Juan del Monte, San Pedro de Macati, San Felipe Neri, Muntinlupa and 
the Taguig-Pateros area. Jorge Vargas was appointed as its mayor. Mayors 
in the cities and municipalities included in the City of Greater Manila 
served as vice mayors in their town. This was in order to ensure Vargas, 
who was Quezon's principal lieutenant for administrative matters, would 
have a position of authority recognized under international military law. 
The City of Greater Manila was abolished by the Japanese with the formation 
of the Philippine Executive Commission to govern the occupied regions of 
the country. The City of Greater Manila served as a model for the present-day 
Metro Manila and the administrative functions of the Governor of Metro 
Manila that was established during the Marcos administration. On November 
7, 1975, Metro Manila was formally established through Presidential Decree 
No. 824. The Metropolitan Manila Commission was also created to manage 
the region.[8] On June 2, 1978, through Presidential Decree No. 1396, the 
metropolitan area was declared the National Capital Region of the Philippines.[10] 
When Metro Manila was established, there were four cities, Manila, Quezon 
City, Caloocan, Pasay and the thirteen municipalities of Las Piñas, Makati, 
Malabon, Mandaluyong, Marikina, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Parañaque, Pasig, 
San Juan, Taguig, Valenzuela and Pateros. At present, all of these municipalities 
except for one have become an independent charted city, only Pateros remains 
as a municipality. President Ferdinand Marcos appointed his wife Imelda 
Marcos as the first governor of Metro Manila. She launched the City of 
Man campaign. The Cultural Center of the Philippines, Metropolitan Folk 
Arts Theater, Philippine International Convention Center, the Lung Center 
of the Philippines, Philippine Heart Center, the Kidney Center of the Philippines 
and the Coconut Palace are all constructed precisely for this purpose. 
The City of Man campaign was discontinued when the Marcos were ousted from 
power after the People Power Revolution. After the 8 years of dictatorship, 
President Marcos was overthrown by the people at a peaceful revolution 
in EDSA in February 1986, where they stayed there for three days. The movement 
was known as the People Power Revolution and made headlines such as "the 
revolution that surprised the world".[11] In 1986, President Corazon Aquino 
issued Executive Order No. 392, reorganizing and changing the structure 
of the Metropolitan Manila Commission and renamed it to the Metropolitan 
Manila Authority. Mayors in the metropolis chose from among themselves 
the chair of the agency. Later on, it was again reorganized in 1995 through 
Republic Act 7924, creating the present-day Metropolitan Manila Development 
Authority. The chairperson of the agency will be appointed by the President 
and should not have a concurrent elected position such as mayor. Former 
Laguna province governor Joey Lina was the last to serve as the Officer-In-Charge 
governor of Metro Manila.[12] In the year-end of 2014, MMDA Chairman Francis 
Tolentino proposed that San Pedro, Laguna be included in Metro Manila as 
its 18th member city.[13] Metro Manila is located in the southwestern portion 
of Luzon. The region lies along the flat alluvial lands extending from 
the mouth of the Pasig River in the west to the higher rugged lands of 
Marikina Valley in the east. The region is geographically divided into 
4 zones: the Coastal Margin, Guadalupe Plateau, Marikina Valley, and the 
Laguna Lowlands. The Coastal Margin that faces the Manila Bay possesses 
resources for offshore fisheries and fishpond development. The various 
reclamation projects in the area are meant for mixed-use urban development. 
The Guadalupe Plateau is the most adaptable to urban development activities 
not only because of its solid geographical foundations but also because 
of its existing infrastructure links with the rest of Luzon. The Marikina 
Valley has fertile land suitable for crop cultivation while the Marikina 
River provides water for industrial uses and discharge. The Laguna Lowlands 
is not only suitable for agriculture and aquaculture but also for industrial 
activity.[14] Metro Manila is prone to earthquakes because it is surrounded 
by active faults including the Marikina Valley Fault System. Other distant 
faults such as the Philippine Faults, Lubang Faults, Manila Trench and 
Casiguran Faults, are a threat as well.[15] Because of the natural disasters 
that poses a threat to Metro Manila, Manila was ranked as the second riskiest 
capital city after Tokyo to live in according to Swiss Re.[16] According 
to the Köppen climate classification, NCR features tropical wet and dry 
climate and tropical monsoon climate. Metro Manila has a relatively short 
dry season from January through May, and a lengthy wet season from June 
through December. There are two national parks in Metro Manila which is 
managed by the National Parks and Development Committee, the Rizal Park 
and Paco Park in Manila. NPDC used to manage Fort Santiago in Intramuros 
and the Quezon Memorial National Park in Quezon City. Because of a tripartite 
agreement between the Quezon City Government, the National Historical Institute 
and the NPDC, the management of Quezon Memorial National Park was transferred 
to the Quezon City Government while the maintenance of Fort Santiago is 
transferred to the Intramuros Administration.[17] NCR has three listed 
protected areas, these are the Rizal Park, Ninoy Aquino Parks & Wildlife 
Center and the Manila Bay Beach Resort.[18] Rizal Park, also known as Luneta 
Park, is considered as the largest urban park in Asia.[19] In the Tourism 
Act of 2009, Rizal Park along with Intramuros are designated as flagship 
destination to become a tourism enterprise zone.[20] A new attraction called 
Paseo de Manila is expected to rise in Rizal Park.[21] On the other hand, 
Paco Park is a recreational garden which was once Manila’s municipal cemetery 
built by the Dominicans during the Spanish colonial period.[22] Founded 
in 1959, Manila Zoo is the oldest zoo in Asia. It is the home to more than 
a thousand animals from different 90 species including the 40-year-old 
elephant, Mali. The zoo has an average of 4,000 visitors weekly. An estimated 
40,000 tourists visits the zoo each month.[23] La Mesa Ecopark is a 33-hectare 
well-developed sanctuary around the La Mesa Watershed. It was established 
through a joint partnership between the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage 
System, ABS-CBN, and the Quezon City Government. La Mesa Ecopark, along 
with the Ninoy Aquino Parks & Wildlife Center, are important nature reserves 
in the Philippines. The Las Piñas-Parañaque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism 
Area (LPPCHEA) was declared as a critical habitat by the Government of 
the Philippines in 2007[24] and was listed by the Ramsar Convention as 
a Wetland of International Importance in 2013.[25] LPPCHEA is composed 
of the Freedom Island in Parañaque and the Long Island in Las Piñas that 
covers 175 hectares and features a mangrove forest of eight species, tidal 
mudflats, secluded ponds with fringing salt-tolerant vegetation, a coastal 
lagoon, and a beach.[26] The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority 
(MMDA) is the agency responsible for the delivery of public services in 
Metro Manila. Its services are limited to traffic management and garbage 
collection. A bill was introduced in 2014 proposing the creation of a new 
governing body in Metro Manila to be known as the Metropolitan Manila Regional 
Administration (MMRA). Unlike the MMDA which is limited to being an administrative 
coordinating body, the proposed MMRA will have police and other typical 
municipal powers and is more akin to the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.[27][28] 
Metro Manila, the National Capital Region, is the seat of the Government 
of the Philippines. All the main offices of the executive departments of 
the country are in Metro Manila. The Department of Agrarian Reform, Department 
of Agriculture, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, National 
Housing Authority and Philippine Coconut Authority has their main offices 
based around Quezon Memorial Circle in Quezon City. Manila, the capital 
city of the country, is the home to the Malacañang Palace, the official 
office and residence of the President of the Philippines. The city is also 
the home of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. Important national institutions 
based in Manila are the Court of Appeals, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, 
and the Departments of Budget and Management, Finance, Health, Justice, 
Labor and Employment and Public Works and Highways. Meanwhile, the Department 
of Science and Technology is based in Taguig while the Department of Tourism 
has its headquarters in Makati. Important economic and financial institutions 
headquartered in the region are the Asian Development Bank, Bangko Sentral 
ng Pilipinas, Development Bank of the Philippines, Land Bank of the Philippines 
and the National Economic and Development Authority. The campus of the 
Government Service Insurance System in Pasay is the home to the Senate 
of the Philippines. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives of the Philippines, 
is based in the Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City along with the Sandiganbayan. 
The Coconut Palace serves as the official office and residence of the Vice 
President of the Philippines. The Philippine National Police is responsible 
for law enforcement in the country. Its headquarters is located at Camp 
Crame in Santolan, Quezon City. The National Capital Region Police Office 
(NCRPO) is the regional branch of PNP that operates in NCR. Its headquarters 
is located at Camp Bagong Diwa in Bicutan, Taguig. Under the supervision 
of NCRPO, Metro Manila is divided into five police districts. The five 
police districts are the Northern Police District (Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas, 
Valenzuela), Eastern Police District (Mandaluyong, Marikina, Pasig, San 
Juan), Manila Police District (City of Manila), Southern Police District 
(Las Piñas, Makati, Muntinlupa, Parañaque, Pasay, Taguig, and Pateros) 
and Quezon City Police District (Quezon City).[29] Metro Manila has the 
highest rate of crime in the country in 2014, with 59,448 crimes reported 
(excluding crimes reported in barangay level) with 25,353 of these crimes 
committed against persons.[30] Following criticisms of high crime rate 
in Metro Manila, the Philippine National Police launched a relentless anti-crime 
drive that resulted in the decrease of crimes in the metropolis.[31][32] 
As of March 2015 Metro Manila's crime rate is down by 50%. From an average 
of 919 crimes reported weekly, it has gone down to 412. Recorded robberies 
and theft also decreased by 63 in just a month.[33] All the 159 police 
community precincts of Metro Manila will be using the electronic blotter 
system in recording crimes starting June 2015.[34] The Bureau of Fire Protection 
National Capital Region provides fire protection and technical rescue as 
well as emergency medical services to the metropolis. It is broadly organized 
into five firefighting districts: Manila, Quezon City, District II, District 
III and District IV. The headquarters of the Armed Forces of the Philippines 
is located at Camp Aguinaldo, along with the Department of National Defense, 
in Murphy, Quezon City. Aside from Camp Aguinaldo, other military bases 
situated in the region are Camp Atienza and Fort Bonifacio. The Philippine 
Army has their headquarters at Fort Bonifacio, Taguig. The Villamor Air 
Base in Ninoy Aquino International Airport is the home to the headquarters 
of the Philippine Air Force while the headquarters of the Philippine Navy 
is located at Roxas Boulevard, Malate, Manila. The Philippine Coast Guard 
has their headquarters at Port Area, Manila. The Coast Guard NCR District 
has its headquarters in Manila and has another Coast Guard Station in Pasig. 
It also has a base in Taguig and maintains several detachments located 
in Navotas, Parañaque, Tangos, Vitas, Manila North Harbor, Manila South 
Harbor and the Cultural Center of the Philippines.[35] In 2012, the AFP 
Joint Task Force-National Capital Region was launched to ensure peace and 
stability in Metro Manila, bearing the same function of the deactivated 
National Capital Regional Command, although it operates on a much smaller 
size than its predecessor.[36] The seventeen local government units of 
Metro Manila are administratively equal to provinces. They are composed 
of sixteen independent cities, classified as highly urbanized cities, and 
one independent municipality: Pateros. Unlike other administrative regions 
in the Philippines, Metro Manila is not composed of provinces. Instead, 
the region is divided into four geographic areas called "districts."[40] 
The districts have their district centers at the four original cities in 
the region: the city-district of Manila (Capital District), Quezon City 
(Eastern Manila), Caloocan (Northern Manila, also informally known as CAMANAVA), 
and Pasay (Southern Manila).[41] The districts serve mainly to organize 
the region's local government units for fiscal and statistical purposes. 
There is a high clamor for the inclusion of San Pedro, Laguna in Metro 
Manila. Support groups from the local government and non-government organizations 
are striving to incorporate San Pedro into Metro Manila by the year 2015. 
Once incorporated, San Pedro will be the 17th city of the National Capital 
Region. During the first city hood anniversary of San Pedro last December 
29, 2014, Guest of Honor MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino said in his speech 
that San Pedro is being eyed as the 18th member of Metro Manila. He also 
said that the proposal will push through at the first meeting of the MMDA 
Council of Mayors in January 2015.[47][48] There are rumors that say after 
San Pedro, the MMDA would have the potential to expand further north into 
Bulacan, annexing the municipalities of Obando and Marilao as well as the 
city of Meycauayan. Some even say that they might be able to add Bacoor 
from Cavite. The National Capital Region has a population of 7007128772530000000♠12,877,253 
according to the 2015 national census. Its total urban area, composing 
of the urban agglomeration which refers to the continuous urban expansion 
of Metro Manila into the provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna and Batangas 
has a population of 7007241230000000000♠24,123,000.[5] It is the most populous 
region in the Philippines, the 7th most populous metropolitan area in Asia, 
and the 3rd most populous urban area in the world. The most populous cities 
in Metro Manila are Quezon City (2,936,116), Manila (1,780,148), Caloocan 
(1,583,978), Taguig (804,915), Pasig (755,300), Parañaque (665,822), Valenzuela 
(620,422), Las Piñas (588,894), Makati (582,602) and Muntinlupa (504,509). 
The National Capital Region accounts for 37.2% of the gross domestic product 
of the Philippines in 2013.[7] Furthermore, it has the highest per capita 
GDP of the country at ₱183,747.[51] The employment rate of NCR is at 89.6% 
as of 2012[update].[52] According to Brookings Institution, the 2014 share 
of output by industry in Metro Manila is as follows: trade and tourism: 
31.4%, business/finance: 28.6%, local/non-market: 15.6%, manufacturing: 
12.5%, transportation: 4.9%, construction: 4%, utilities: 2.8%, and commodities: 
0.3%.[53] Metro Manila will add 1.85 million square meters of office spaces 
between 2015 and 2017 in the central business districts in Makati, Taguig, 
and Quezon City as more global firm such as Google and HSBC seeks to outsource 
business process in the Philippines.[54] The vacancy rate for office spaces 
remains low, at less 3% in the year-end of 2014.[55] Manila remains as 
the least expensive capital city in the Asia-Pacific to occupy prime office 
space at an average rent of $22 per square meter per month.[56] Metro Manila 
makes it to the "Global Top 30" cities according to property consultancy 
firm Jones Lang Lasalle, citing its economic scale, vast population, large 
gross domestic product and BPO specialization as its competitive edge.[57] 
Furthermore, the region ranks 3rd for the top business process outsourcing 
global destinations, next to Bangalore and Mumbai.[58] The region's retail 
sector remains strong, bolstered by remittances abroad, BPOs, and its tourism 
sector.[59] Historically, the main business district of the metropolis 
was Binondo, where commercial trading flourished since the 15th century. 
By the 1960s, economic activities shifted from Binondo to Makati. It transformed 
Makati it into one of the leading financial centers in Asia. Still, Binondo 
remained as a cultural and financial center because of the vast Chinese 
population residing and doing business in the area. The minimum wage of 
Metro Manila is at ₱481 ($10.77) for non-agricultural workers and at ₱444 
($9.94) for those working in the agricultural sector,[60][61] the highest 
minimum wage among all the 17 regions of the country.[62] Prime business 
and commercial centers in the metropolis are Makati, the country's premier 
financial center, Bonifacio Global City, Ortigas Center, Quezon City, Manila, 
Pasay and Alabang. Metro Manila has plenty of mixed-use developments owned 
and developed by private corporations such as the Ayala Corporation, Megaworld 
Corporation and SM Prime Holdings. Ayala Land owns and develops Arca South 
in Taguig, Ayala Center in the Central Business District, Circuit Makati, 
and The Cloverleaf, Vertis North and U.P.–Ayala Land TechnoHub in Quezon 
City. Meanwhile, the Lucio Tan led Eton Properties owns and develops Eton 
Centris in the corner of EDSA and Quezon Avenue in Quezon City. Makati, 
the sixteenth most populous city in the Philippines, is the premier business 
and commercial center of the Philippines. The Central Business District 
is the headquarters to most of the multinational corporations residing 
in the Philippines as well as the country's biggest commercial firms and 
BPO companies.[63] The Central Business District has an office stock of 
1.1 million square meters of Grade A and premium office space.[64] It is 
the home to the tallest skyscrapers in the region as well as in the country. 
Bonifacio Global City is the newest business district of Manila and is 
the premier financial and lifestyle center of the metropolis. It is located 
in the north-western part of Taguig City. It used to be a military base 
known as Fort Bonifacio. The Bases and Conversion Development Authority 
(BCDA) privatized the property and its income from the sale was intended 
to be used for the modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. 
Upon its privatization, the place was transformed it into a business hub 
featuring numerous tourist attractions such as The Mind Museum, high-end 
shops, towering office skyscrapers, and luxurious lofts and condominiums. 
Bonifacio Global City will soon overtake the Makati Central Business District 
as the premier financial center of the country in the future. One of the 
reasons for it is that the Philippine Stock Exchange will relocate its 
headquarters in BGC. Also, it has more spaces and land for future developments. 
It is also the most active business district, generating over 50 percent 
of the growth in property market and has more available space for rent 
or lease and sale than Makati.[64] Ortigas Center is the central business 
district located in Mandaluyong and Pasig, with a small portion of it located 
in Quezon City. Landmarks in Ortigas include the EDSA Shrine, Shangri-La 
Plaza and the SM Megamall. Furthermore, The Medical City has its main campus 
in Ortigas Center. Important financial and national institutions headquartered 
in Ortigas are the Asian Development Bank, Union Bank of The Philippines 
and the National Economic and Development Authority. Ortigas is also the 
home to the headquarters of San Miguel Corporation, Jollibee Foods Corporation, 
Lopez Group of Companies and The Manila Electric Company. The Araneta Center, 
Eastwood City, both located in Quezon City are the secondary business districts 
of Metro Manila. Araneta Center is a secondary business district developed 
by the Araneta Center, Inc. which is owned by the Araneta family. Its centerpiece 
is the Smart Araneta Coliseum, one of the largest indoor coliseums in Asia 
and the main venue of the Philippine Basketball Association. Eastwood City, 
located at the Bagumbayan area of Quezon City, meanwhile is a state-of-the-art 
residential, commercial, business and entertainment complex developed by 
Megaworld Corporation in Bagumbayan, Quezon City. It is the first cyberpark 
in the Philippines.[65] Tourism is a vital industry of the region. Metro 
Manila is the main gateway to the Philippines. Trade and tourism represents 
31.4% of share of NCR's output by industry according to Brookings Institution.[53] 
Metro Manila welcomed 974,379 overnight visitors in 2012, making it the 
top overnight tourist destination of the country.[66] Manila is visited 
by the majority of international tourists coming to the country registering 
a total of 3,139,756 arrivals in 2012.[67] Metro Manila will open 4,612 
hotel rooms this 2015. It is also expected to exceed the 3,500 annual addition 
of hotel rooms in the next two years.[68][69][70] Global Blue ranked Manila 
as one of the "Best Shopping Destinations" in Asia.[71][72] Metro Manila 
is home to some of the largest shopping malls in the world, three of which 
are in the top 10. SM Megamall in Mandaluyong ranks as the 3rd largest 
shopping mall in the world, followed by SM City North EDSA in Quezon City 
bagging the 4th place. Meanwhile, SM Mall of Asia in Pasay ranks as the 
9th largest shopping mall in world. Other shopping malls in Metro Manila 
in the list of the largest shopping malls in the world are the Ever Gotesco 
Commonwealth Center, Festival Supermall, Greenbelt, Market! Market!, SM 
Aura Premier, SM Southmall and TriNoma. Gambling in Metro Manila has also 
become a popular tourist attraction in the region. Metro Manila is a popular 
gaming destination in Asia,[73] rivaling other major gaming destinations 
such as Macau and Singapore.[74][75] There are around 20 casinos in the 
metropolis,[76] featuring luxurious casino hotels and integrated resorts. 
Its thriving local gambling market makes Manila attractive to casino operators.[77] 
Popular gaming destinations are Entertainment City in Bay City, Parañaque 
which contains the City of Dreams Manila and Solaire Resort & Casino, and 
Newport City in Pasay.[78] Intramuros is the historic center of Manila. 
Originally, it was considered to be Manila itself at the time when the 
Philippines was under the Spanish Empire colonial rule. Owing to its history 
and cultural value, Intramuros and Rizal Park are designated as flagship 
destination to become a tourism enterprise zone in the Tourism Act of 2009.[20][21] 
Intramuros is managed by the Intramuros Administration (IA). The architecture 
of Intramuros reflects the Spanish colonial style and the American neoclassical 
architectural style, since the Philippines was a colony of Spain and the 
United States before it was granted its independence in 1946. Kalesa is 
a popular mode of transportation in Intramuros and nearby places[79] such 
as Binondo, Ermita and the Rizal Park. Popular tourist destinations in 
Intramuros include the Baluarte de San Diego, Club Intramuros Golf Course, 
Cuartel de Santa Lucia, Fort Santiago, Manila Cathedral, Palacio Arzobispal, 
Palacio de Santa Potenciana, Palacio del Gobernador, Plaza Mexico, Plaza 
de Roma, San Agustin Church and its newest tourist attraction, the Ayuntamiento 
de Manila.[80] Some of the country's oldest schools are founded in Intramuros, 
these are the University of Santo Tomas (1611), Colegio de San Juan de 
Letran (1620), and Ateneo de Manila University (1859). Only Colegio de 
San Juan de Letran (1620) remains at Intramuros; the University of Santo 
Tomas transferred to a new campus at Sampaloc in 1927, and Ateneo left 
Intramuros for Loyola Heights, Quezon City (while still retaining "de Manila" 
in its name) in 1952. Other prominent educational institutions include 
the Manila High School and the University of the City of Manila. Metro 
Manila is widely celebrated in popular lore, frequently the setting for 
mostly Filipino books, movies, and television programs. Flores de Mayo 
is widely celebrated throughout all the places in Metro Manila. The yearly 
Metro Manila Film Festival, inaugurated in 1966, is the forerunner of all 
Philippine film festivals. Metro Manila is the home to the National Museum 
of the Philippines, the national museum of the country. It operates a chain 
of museums located in the grounds of Rizal Park just outside Intramuros, 
such as the National Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of the Filipino People 
and the Museum of Natural History. The National Museum complex occupies 
the place and buildings that were a part of a new capital center proposed 
by Daniel Burnham in 1901. Prominent museums in Metro Manila include the 
Ayala Museum, Bahay Tsinoy, Casa Manila, Lopez Museum, Metropolitan Museum 
of Manila, The Mind Museum, Museo Pambata, Museo Valenzuela, Museum of 
Philippine Political History, Pasig City Museum and the Rizal Shrine. Museums

B. Vargas Museum and Filipiniana Research Center, Museum of Contemporary 
Art and Design,[81] UP Museum of a History of Ideas, and the UST Museum 
of Arts and Sciences. The national theater of the Philippines, also known 
as the "Tanghalang Pambansa", is situated on a 62-hectare (150-acre) cultural 
complex between the cities of called the Cultural Center of the Philippines. 
The complex is located between the cities of Manila and Pasay. Aside from

Transportation development in Metro Manila follows the Metro Manila Dream 
Plan, which consists of building short-term to long-term infrastructure 
lasting up to 2030 and addressing its issues on traffic, land use and environment.[96][97] 
The roads of Metro Manila is built around the City of Manila. Roads are 
classified as local, national or subdivision roads. There are ten radial 
roads branching out from the city. Also there are five circumferential 
roads forming a series of concentric semi-circular arts around Manila. 
The circumferential and radial roads are systems of interconnected roads 
and highways. A problem with the circumferencial roads are the missing 
road links. These are the roads that are not constructed (yet) to give 
way for development due to Metro Manila's rapid urbanization. The metropolis 
is resolving this problem through the completion of missing road links 
or through the construction of connector roads. An important circumferential 
road is the Circumferential Road 4, the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue or 
more popularly known as EDSA. It traverses the cities of Pasay, Makati, 
Mandaluyong, Quezon City and Caloocan. MRT Line 3 follows the alignment 
of EDSA, from Taft Avenue in Pasay up to TriNoma, terminating before it 
reaches Caloocan. Circumferential Road 5 serves the people near the regional 
limits of Metro Manila and also serves as an alternate route for Circumferential 
Road 4. Prominent radial road include the Radial Road 1, composed of Roxas 
Boulevard and the Manila-Cavite Expressway (Coastal Road) that connects 
Metro Manila to Cavite, Radial Road 3 or the South Luzon Expressway that 
connects Metro Manila to Laguna, Radial Road 6, composed of Aurora Boulevard 
and Marcos Highway that runs up to Rizal and Radial Road 8 or the North 
Luzon Expressway that serves as the gateway to the north. At present, the 
construction of the Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3 and the NAIA Expressway 
Phase 2 is ongoing, which are part of the Metro Manila Dream Plan. Other 
ongoing projects in the dream plan include the rehabilitation of EDSA, 
and the construction of the missing road links for the circumferential 
roads (e.g. Taft Avenue Flyover, Metro Manila Interchange Project Phase 
IV). Metro Manila has three railway lines managed by two entities. The 
Manila Light Rail Transit System (LRT) operates the LRT Line 1 (Green Line) 
and the LRT Line 2 (Blue Line). On the other hand, the Manila Metro Rail 
Transit System operates the MRT Line 3 (Yellow Line) which traverses EDSA. 
Line 1 has a weekly ridership of 560,000 people.[98] In February 2014, 
a total of 14.06 million passengers took Line 1 while 6.13 million took 
Line 2.[99] Currently, the Manila Metro Rail Transit Line 7 (Red Line) 
is under construction. When completed, it will connect Metro Manila to 
the province of Bulacan. Furthermore, a common station, connecting Line 
1, Line 3 and the future Line 7 is planned, although bureaucracy in the 
Department of Transportation and Communications, corporate feud and issues 
related to its proposed location are hindrances of its construction.[100][101][102][103] 
LRT Line 1 is planned to be extended up to Bacoor in the province of Cavite.[98] 
A second extension, the LRT Line 6, would link Bacoor with Dasmarinas further 
along Aguinaldo Highway. Currently, the LRT Line 2 East Extension is under 
construction. The east extension will connect Metro Manila to the province 
of Rizal. It will also be extended westward in the future, thereby increasing 
connectivity to areas of Divisoria and in Pier 4 at the Port of Manila. 
The Philippine National Railways operates a commuter rail service in Metro 
Manila called the PNR Metro South Commuter. Its main terminal station is 
located at Tutuban in Tondo. When the LRT Line 2 West Extension is completed, 
Tutuban may become the busiest interchange station in the metropolis, adding 
another 400,000 people from the current 1 million people Tutuban Center 
attracts.[104] The Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) located in 
the cities of Pasay and Parañaque is the premier gateway in Metro Manila. 
It is the only airport serving the region and it is the country's busiest 
airport.[105] The Ninoy Aquino International Airport is divided into four 
terminals namely: the Terminal 1, Terminal 2 which is exclusively used 
by the Philippine Airlines, Terminal 3 which is the newest and largest 
in the NAIA complex and the Terminal 4 which is also known as the Manila 
Domestic Passenger Terminal. The other airport that serves Metro Manila 
is the Clark International Airport located in Angeles, Pampanga. Bus franchises 
in the region are regulated by the Land Transportation Franchising and 
Regulatory Board. The Express Connect Bus is the express bus system that 
runs from its dispatch terminal in Fairview up to the central business 
districts along EDSA. It aims to cut travel time substantially and provide 
a faster, safer and more convenient bus service to commuters, who are usually 
caught at the heavy traffic across the metropolis.[106][107] A second express 
bus link from SM North EDSA and SM Megamall to Makati City opened in December 
2015, and by January 2016 was the line on which, for the first time in 
nearly three decades, a double-decker bus traveled on EDSA, to the delight 
of motorists, followed by a 3rd link, this time from Robinsons Galleria 
to the Ayala Center complex in February 2016 and a 4th in March linking 
the Ayala Center to the Alabang Town center in Muntinlupa via the Metro 
Manila Skyway. Metro Manila will have its bus rapid transit system operational 
by 2018. The 27.7 kilometer proposed BRT system will traverse Commonwealth 
Avenue up to the Manila City Hall. The planned BRT system costs ₱4.9 billion 
($109.5 million) and will have a fleet of 300 buses and 32 stations.[108][109] 
The Pasig River Ferry Service run by the Metropolitan Manila Development 
Authority is the ferry shuttle system of Metro Manila. It traverses the 
Pasig River from Plaza Mexico in Intramuros to Barangay Pinagbuhatan in 
Pasig. Although it was referred to as a ferry, it is more akin to a water 
bus. It has 17 stations, but only 14 are operational. Meralco is the sole 
electric distributor of Metro Manila. It generates its power from the National 
Power Corporation and other independent power producers in Luzon. The Metropolitan 
Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) was responsible for the supply and 
delivery of potable water and the sewarage system in Metro Manila. It was 
privatized in 1997 and the region and its immediate surrounding areas was 
split into the east and west concession. The winning corporations provides 
the same function of MWSS. The Maynilad Water Services took over the west 
zone, which is composed of Manila (excluding the southeastern part of the 
city), Caloocan, Las Piñas, Malabon, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Parañaque, Pasay 
and Valenzuela. It also operates in some parts of Makati and Quezon City. 
Manila Water operates on the east zone, comprising the cities of Mandaluyong, 
Marikina, Pasig, Pateros, San Juan and Taguig. It also operates in large 
areas of Makati and Quezon City and the southeastern part of Manila, which 
was excluded from the west zone. For garbage hauling, the region spent 
₱4.221 billion ($93.855 million) in 2013. Quezon City spent the most at 
₱994.59 million ($22.115 million) while Pateros, NCR's only municipality, 
spent the least amount of money on garbage at ₱9.478 million ($210,747).[110]
