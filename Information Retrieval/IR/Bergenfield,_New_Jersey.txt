is governed under the Borough form of New Jersey municipal government. 
The governing body consists of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising 
six council members, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan 
basis as part of the November general election. A Mayor is elected directly 
by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consists 
of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, 
with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.[7] 
The Borough form of government used by Bergenfield, the most common system 
used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which 
council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at 
meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances 
subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The 
mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and 
most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of 
the council.[47][48] As of 2016[update], the mayor of Bergenfield is Republican 
Norman Schmelz, who took office as the mayor in November 2013. Mayor Schmelz 
was reelected in 2015 to a full four-year term expiring on December 31, 
2019.[49] Schmelz was first elected to fill the seat of Timothy Driscoll, 
who had died in office in March 2013, defeating Carlos Aguasvivas who had 
filled the seat on an interim basis since being appointed by the council 
in April of that year.[50][51] Members of the Borough Council are Council 
president P. Christopher "Chris" Tully (D, 2017), Arvin Amatorio (D, 2017), 
Ora C. Kornbluth (D, 2016), Thomas A. Lodato (D, 2018), Hernando Rivera
