Charles Devens (January 1, 1910 in Milton, Massachusetts â€“ August 13, 2003 
in Scarborough, Maine), was a Major League Baseball player who played pitcher 
from 1932-1934. After pitching for Harvard he was signed in 1932 to the 
New York Yankees. At 92 years of age, Devens was the oldest surviving member 
of the famed 1932 world championship Yankees team and recalled with great 
detail [1] the now famous Babe Ruth's Called Shot Signed in 1932 and leaving 
the team in 1934, Devens' Major league career was cut short by his future 
father-in-law who refused to have a ball player as a son in law. After 
his departure from the big leagues Devens established his reputation as 
a standout businessman in Boston. Given his short 3-year career Charlie 
Devens was only able to amass 82 innings pitched with only one start in 
1934. At the conclusion of his career, Charlie held a 5 and 3 record with 
31 strikeouts and a 3.73 ERA. His granddaughter was Sarah Devens. She participated 
on three varsity teams at Dartmouth College: field hockey, ice hockey and 
lacrosse. She was named a captain of all three teams and was considered 
by many teammates to be the best female athlete Dartmouth ever had.[1]
