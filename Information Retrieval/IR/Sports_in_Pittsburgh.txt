Sports in Pittsburgh have been played dating back to the American Civil 
War. Baseball, hockey, and the first professional American football game 
had been played in the city by 1892. Pittsburgh was first known as the 
"City of Champions" when the Pittsburgh Pirates, Pittsburgh Panthers, and 
Pittsburgh Steelers won multiple championships in the 1970s.[1] Today, 
the city has three major professional sports franchises, the Pirates, Steelers, 
and Penguins; while the University of Pittsburgh Panthers compete in a 
Division I BCS conference, the highest level of collegiate athletics in 
the United States, in both football and basketball. Local universities 
Duquesne and Robert Morris also field Division I teams in men's and women's 
basketball and Division I FCS teams in football. Robert Morris also fields 
Division I men's and women's ice hockey teams. Pittsburgh is once again 
being called the "City of Champions" as its Steelers and Penguins are recent 
champions of the NFL and NHL, respectively, in 2009. These accomplishments 
and others helped Pittsburgh earn the title of "Best Sports City" in 2009 
from the Sporting News.[2] Including the 2008–09 seasons, the Steelers 
have reached the NFL playoffs in six of the last eight seasons—winning 
two Super Bowl titles—and the Penguins have reached the NHL playoffs the 
last four years with back-to-back finals appearances, an Atlantic Division 
Crown, and a Stanley Cup championship, none of which won at home (the last 
championship won in Pittsburgh was in 1960 by the Pirates). The flag of 
Pittsburgh is colored with black and gold, based on the colors of William 
Pitt's coat of arms; Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States in 
which all professional sporting teams share the same colors. The city's 
first National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates were 
the first to wear black and gold as their colors. The colors were adopted 
by founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Art Rooney, in 1933. In 1948, the 
Pittsburgh baseball Pirates switched their colors from red and blue to 
black and gold. Pittsburgh's second NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Penguins, 
wore blue and white, due to then-general manager Jack Riley's upbringing 
in Ontario. In 1979, after the Steelers and Pirates had each won their 
respective league championships, the Penguins altered their color scheme 
to match, despite objections from the Boston Bruins.[3][4] In 1975, late 
Steelers radio broadcaster Myron Cope invented the Terrible Towel, which 
has become "arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports 
team."[5] Cope was one of multiple sports figures born in Pittsburgh and 
its surrounding area; others include golfer Arnold Palmer, Olympian Kurt 
Angle, and basketball player Jack Twyman. Pittsburgh is also sometimes 
called the "Cradle of Quarterbacks"[6][7] due to the number of prominent 
players of that position who hail from the area, including NFL greats Jim 
Kelly, George Blanda, Johnny Unitas, Joe Namath, Dan Marino, and Joe Montana. 
The City of Pittsburgh has had various professional sports franchises throughout 
its history and today is home to three teams competing at the highest professional 
level in their respective sports: the Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL, the 
Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL, and the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League 
Baseball. We had 'em all the way Prior to 1876, three amateur Pittsburgh 
baseball teams—the Enterprise, the Xanthas, and the Olympics—competed, 
most often at Recreation Park.[9] On April 15, 1876, Recreation Park was 
the site of a game between the Xanthas and the Pittsburgh Alleghenies (alternately 
spelled "Alleghenys"[10]), an unrelated forerunner to the "Alleghenys" 
team which would later be renamed the Pirates. The Alleghenies won the 
game 7–3.[11] The 1877 squad was the most successful yet, finishing within 
1 game of the pennant in the International Association; only a Canadian 
team had a better record, allowing the city potential bragging rights for 
being the best American team that season. 1882 marked the first "major 
league" and fully professional season for the Pittsburgh Alleghenies (Pirates) 
and in 1887, the Alleghenies moved from American Association to the National 
League after owner William Nimick became frustrated over a contract dispute.[12] 
The Pirates were purchased in 1900 by Barney Dreyfuss, who would go down 
in history as the "Father of the modern World Series" and its precursor, 
the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup, both of which saw the Pirates participate 
in the inaugural series. He recruited Hall of Famers Fred Clarke and Pittsburgh 
native Honus Wagner and built the first concrete and steel (first "modern") 
baseball stadium, Forbes Field. Under Dreyfuss, the Pirates won pre-World 
Series world titles in 1901 and 1902, National League pennants from 1901–1903, 
1909, 1925 and 1927 and World Series in 1909 and 1925. The 1902 squad set 
major league records for winning percentage and even today is the second 
most winning team ever fielded in the sport.[13] The franchise won the 
World Series three more times—in 1960, 1971, and 1979. In 1960, the team 
became the first to win a World Series on a home run, and remain the only 
team to win on a homer in the decisive seventh game. In 1979, the Pirates 
tied their own 1925 World Series team, coming back from a 1-game to 3 deficit, 
winning three in a row for the title, thus becoming (and remain) the only 
franchise in the history of all sports to win world titles more than once 
coming back from a 1–3 deficit. The 1979 Pirates also are unique in that 
they are the only team in all sports to have their players capture all 
four MVP awards (Seasonal, All Star Game, Playoff and World Series) in 
a single season.[14] Since 1970 the team has won their division and qualified 
for the playoffs nine times, six in the 1970s and three times in a row 
from 1990 to 1992. Pirates have won the league MVP award in 1960, 1966, 
1979, 1990 and 1992 and the Cy Young Award in 1960 and 1990. In 2001, the 
team opened PNC Park on the city's North Shore, regularly ranked as one 
of the top three baseball parks in the country. In addition to the Pirates, 
the Pittsburgh Stogies, Pittsburgh Burghers and Pittsburgh Rebels played 
in various leagues from 1884 to 1915. The Rebels won the pennant in 1912 
and finished just a half game shy of a pennant in 1915.[15] The Pittsburgh 
Keystones, Homestead Grays (playing in the city limits), and Pittsburgh 
Crawfords played in the Negro Leagues. With players including Josh Gibson 
and Cumberland Posey the Grays won 12 league titles—the most by any Negro 
League team[1]—including nine consecutive from 1937 to 1945. The Crawfords 
finished their eight-year existence with a .633 winning percentage, with 
a line-up including Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, and Satchel Paige and claimed 
four straight league titles from 1933 until 1936, with the 1935 team judged 
by some[who?] as the greatest one to ever take the field in the Negro Leagues, 
or perhaps in baseball period. Just as they initially played in the first 
"modern" ballpark in the majors (Forbes Field), Crawfords owner Gus Greenlee 
constructed the first steel and concrete "modern" stadium in the Negro 
Leagues, with Greenlee Field opening in the Hill District on April 29, 
1932.[16] The city has enjoyed championship basketball since the sport 
began. Pittsburgh South Side won titles in 1904, 1907 and 1913, coming 
in second place in 1908, 1911 and 1915. The "Black Fives" league enjoyed 
success in the city with Monticello-Loendi winning national championships 
in 1912, and four in a row from 1920–23. The Pittsburgh Pirates from 1937–39 
and Pittsburgh Raiders in 1944–45 continued professional basketball in 
the city in the National Basketball League. Pittsburgh had one of the founding 
members of what became the NBA, the Pittsburgh Ironmen however only played 
a single season 1947–48 before folding. The Pittsburgh Renaissance (or 
Rens) played from 1961 until 1963 in the ABL, posting the city's best record 
in almost 40 years when they finished 2nd in 1962. The most lasting legacy 
of pro roundball in Pittsburgh was the Pittsburgh Pipers-Pittsburgh Condors 
of the American Basketball Association from 1967 until 1972. In the first 
ABA World Championship in 1968, the Pipers defeated the New Orleans Buccaneers, 
which were owned by Harry Connick Sr..[citation needed] After the ABA Pipers/Condors 
folded in 1972 the city hosted the Pittsburgh Piranhas of the CBA in the 
mid-1990s. The franchise made it to the championship round in the 1994–95 
season only to come away second best. In the late 2000s the Pittsburgh 
Xplosion, a development league team owned by former NBA player Freddie 
Lewis,[17] played in a revamped ABA/CBA at Mellon Arena and the Petersen 
Events Center before ceasing operations prior to the 2008–09 season because 
of the economic recession. Another professional basketball team, the Pittsburgh 
Phantoms of the American Basketball Association, played during the 2009–10 
season and held their games at the Carnegie Library of Homestead, but folded 
prior to the following season. First played in Pittsburgh in 1895, ice 
hockey grew in popularity after the Duquesne Gardens opened in 1899. In 
1901 the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL), a semi-professional 
ice hockey league based in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s, may have been 
involved in the first trade involving professional hockey players. In 1907, 
the WPHL was the first league to openly hire hockey players. The league 
played its games in three Pittsburgh hockey arenas, the Gardens, the Schenley 
Park Casino and the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall. The Casino, which 
was destroyed by a fire in 1896, had the first artificial ice surface in 
North America, was the first place in Pittsburgh where organized ice hockey 
was played and had the most modern indoor lighting system of the time era, 
that consisted of 1,500 incandescent lamps, 11 arc lights and 4 white calcium 
lights. In 1905–1907, the city was represented in the International Professional 
Hockey League, the first fully professional hockey league, by the Pittsburgh 
Professionals. The Gardens housed the largest indoor rink in the world 
and was home to the city's first NHL franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
from 1925 to 1930. The Gardens also was home to the Pittsburgh Shamrocks 
and the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the International Hockey League as 
well as the Pittsburgh Hornets of the American Hockey League.[18] In 1961, 
Pittsburgh Civic Arena was constructed for use of the Pittsburgh Civic 
Light Opera. Founded, by Jack McGregor and Peter Block as part of the 1967 
NHL expansion, the Pittsburgh Penguins have played home games at Civic 
Arena since their inception.[19] The Penguins won back-to-back Stanley 
Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. The franchise recorded their third 
Stanley Cup in 2009.[20] The teams included players Mark Recchi, Kevin 
Stevens, Jaromír Jágr, and Mario Lemieux.[21] Lemieux holds multiple franchise 
records and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997.[22][23] He 
suffered from multiple injuries, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, throughout 
his career.[24] In 1999, Lemieux purchased the Penguins and saved the franchise 
from bankruptcy. He returned to play one year later as the first player/owner 
of the modern era.[25] The Penguins, led by top point scorers Evgeni Malkin 
and Sidney Crosby, returned to the Stanley Cup finals in 2008 and won the 
franchise's third Cup in 2009.[26] As of 2008, the Penguins rank 113% above 
the national average for male television viewers aged 18 to 34.[27] Forbes 
projects that the franchise will become more valuable after their move 
to the Consol Energy Center in 2010.[28] The franchise recorded their fourth 
Stanley Cup in 2016. On November 12, 1892, William Heffelfinger was paid 
$500 to participate in an American football game for the Allegheny Athletic 
Association. With this transaction, Heffelfinger became the first person 
to be paid to play football.[citation needed] The first professional football 
game was held at Recreation Park in Pittsburgh.[citation needed] Heffelfinger 
scored the game's only points as the Allegheny Athletic Association defeated 
the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, 4–0.[29][30] The early professional football 
era was also represented in Pittsburgh, by top athletic association teams 
in the Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit. The Duquesne 
Country and Athletic Club, was the top pro team in the state in 1898 and 
1899. The first ever pro football all-star game was played at Exposition 
Park between the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club and a collection of 
players from several teams in the area on December 3, 1898. Duquesne won 
the game 16-0. Later the Homestead Library & Athletic Club, fielded the 
top pro team in the state in 1900 and 1901. In 1902 the top players in 
the area, mainly from the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club line-up, formed 
the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League. The Stars were 
suspected of being financed by Barney Dreyfuss and William Chase Temple, 
the owners of baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates. The team featured baseball 
players in the line-up including Christy Mathewson, a future Hall of Fame 
pitcher with the New York Giants and Fred Crolius, and outfielder with 
Pirates. The team won the league's only championship in 1902. In 1933, 
as the oldest of nine children Art Rooney, who had been raised on the North 
Side of Pittsburgh, founded the Pittsburgh Steelers.[31] Originally nicknamed 
the Pirates,[32] the team later changed their name to the Steelers, to 
represent the city's heritage of producing steel. The Steelers' first season 
with a winning record came in 1942. However, they lost their first playoff 
game in 1947.[33] In 1969, the Steelers hired head coach Chuck Noll who 
strategically drafted players in order to improve the team.[34] Three years 
later, in the first playoff game at Three Rivers Stadium Pittsburgh's rookie 
running back Franco Harris returned an errant pass that bounced off an 
opposing player for a game winning touchdown in a play that later became 
labeled the Immaculate Reception. In 1974, the Steelers won their first 
Super Bowl in franchise history—a feat which they would repeat in 1975, 
1978, and 1979 to become the first NFL franchise to win four Super Bowls. 
In 1992, Noll was succeeded by Bill Cowher, who led the franchise to its 
fifth Super Bowl victory in 2005. Mike Tomlin succeeded Cower and led the 
Steelers to an NFL record sixth Super Bowl victory in 2008.[33] As of 2009, 
the Steelers have 18 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[35] In October 
1964, Ernie Stautner, who played on the Steelers from 1950 to 1963, became 
the only Steelers' player to have his number—70—retired.[36] Charles "Mean 
Joe" Greene had his number -75- retired in 2014. In 2008, ESPN.com ranked 
Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL, citing their "unbelievable" sellout 
streak of 299 consecutive games.[37][38] Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney, 
son of founder Art Rooney, became the majority owner of the Steelers in 
November 2008 along with his son Art II, after they bought all of the shares 
of two of his four brothers.[39] Outside of the NFL, the city was represented 
by the Pittsburgh Americans of the second American Football League in 1936 
and 1937. It was also be briefly represented by the Pittsburgh Maulers 
of the United States Football League, in 1984, and the Pittsburgh Gladiators 
(now the Tampa Bay Storm), of the Arena Football League from 1987 until 
1990. A second Arena Football League team, the Pittsburgh Power, played 
in the Consol Energy Center from 2011 until 2014.[40] In addition, Pittsburgh 
is home to three women's full-contact football teams: the Pittsburgh Passion, 
the Pittsburgh Force and the Steel City Renegades. Founded in 2002, as 
members of the National Women's Football Association and having played 
in the Independent Women's Football League, the Passion are currently members 
of the Women's Football Alliance.[41] The team went 12–0 and won a national 
title in 2007 as members of the NWFA.[42] A newer team, the Pittsburgh 
Force, were founded in 2008 and are members of the WFA. The Renegades, 
founded in 2009, are members of the Women's Spring Football League. The 
"most established area minor-league football team" the Pittsburgh Colts 
are members of the North American Football League's Regional American Football 
League.[43][44] The Pittsburgh Riverhounds are members of the USL Professional 
Division and play in Highmark Stadium.[45] The amateur club Pittsburgh 
Beadling have contested for regional and national titles for over 100 years, 
winning the National Amateur Cup in 1954,[46] and historic teams such as 
the suburban Harmarville Hurricanes won national titles in 1952 and 1956 
and contested for it in 1953. Pittsburgh Gallatin, Pittsburgh-Heidleberg 
and Pittsburgh Morgan Strasser all winning national titles in the 1920s, 
the 1930s, the 1940s and the 1950s. The region's interest in soccer continues 
as modern stars such as natives Justin Evans, Meghan Klingenberg, Don Malinowski, 
John Stollmeyer, A. J. Wood and Marvell Wynne II have all achieved international 
success. The Pittsburgh Sledgehammers are a rugby league team based in 
Cheswick, Pennsylvania (outside of Pittsburgh) which was formed in 2010 
and plays in the AMNRL competition. The Pittsburgh Harlequins are a rugby 
union team also based in Cheswick. The Pittsburgh Harlequins Rugby Club 
was founded in 1973 by a group of University of Pittsburgh law students. 
The organization has an active roster of 45 players and an alumni roster 
inclusive of more than 70 seasons of play. The Harlequins Rugby Club is 
a Division I member of the Mid-Atlantic Rugby Football Union. Over 300 
active players wear the Harlequin jerseys every year at the Division 1 
men's, Under 19, and Under 14 levels. In 1995, the Founders Field Center 
for Athletic Leadership was developed to support the Harlequins Men's and 
Youth programs. The 12 acre Founders Field facility includes lighting, 
irrigation, a clubhouse, locker rooms, concessions, and parking. Golf has 
deep roots in the area with the region boasting the oldest course in continuous 
use in the nation: Foxburg Country Club dating from 1887. The suburban 
Oakmont Country Club has hosted the U.S. Open championships more than any 
other course in the nation (9) along with two U.S. Women's Open championships, 
three PGA Championships, and eight U.S. Amateurs. Such golf legends as 
Arnold Palmer, Jim Furyk and Rocco Mediate learned the game and began their 
careers on Pittsburgh area courses. Suburban courses such as Laurel Valley 
Golf Club and the Pittsburgh Field Club have hosted PGA Championships (1937, 
1965), the Ryder Cup (1975), LPGA Championships (1957–1958), Senior Players 
Championships (2012–2013) and the Senior PGA Championship (2005). Local 
courses have sponsored annual major tournaments for 39 years: The region 
has deep roots in the sport of Golf boasting the oldest continuous country 
club in the U.S. at Foxburg dating back to 1887. The suburban Oakmont Country 
Club has hosted the U.S. Open Championships more than any other course 
at nine, and thus the Pittsburgh metro area more than any other metro. 
Oakmont has also hosted two U.S. Women's Open championships, three PGA 
Championships, and eight U.S. Amateurs. Other area courses such as Laurel 
Valley Golf Club and the Pittsburgh Field Club have hosted PGA Championships, 
the Ryder Cup, LPGA Championships and Senior PGA Championships. The region 
has hosted annual PGA Tour events such as the 84 Lumber Classic (2001–2006) 
at Mystic Rock, the Dapper Dan Open 1939–49, the Pittsburgh Open (1950s), 
the Tri State Open (1980s),[47] the Pittsburgh Senior Classic (1993–1998) 
and since 2010 the annual Mylan Classic. Golf greats such as Arnold Palmer, 
Jim Furyk, Rocco Mediate and others hail from the region.[citation needed] 
Since the 1960s the city has focused on revitalizing its rivers, hosting 
the Bassmaster Classic and the Forrest Wood Cup in the 2000s and seeing 
a boom in local fishing participation. Among the variety are Catfish and 
Trout. [1] Pittsburgh is the host city for both the annual Three Rivers 
Regatta (since 1977) and the annual Head of the Ohio (since 1987) races 
and events. The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and 
Duquesne University as well as several area high schools have long standing 
rowing teams. In 2010 National Geographic named the city to its top six 
of "Best Cities for Kayaking". [2] Kayak Pittsburgh is the largest river 
recreation rental in the area located on the North Shore on the Allegheny 
River. Suburban Ohiopyle State Park offers some of the best white-water 
rafting in the country. Pittsburgh has multiple mountain biking areas close 
to the city in area parks and in the surrounding suburbs. Frick Park has 
biking trails and Hartwood Acres Park has many miles of single track trails. 
A recent project, "Rails to Trails", has converted miles of former railroads 
to recreational trails, including a Pittsburgh-Washington, D.C. bike/walking 
trail. Kayaking is popular on the city's three rivers. Pittsburgh and its 
region are internationally known for its extensive and varied trail system. 
Such assets as the Three Rivers, Ohio River, Youghiogheny River, Beaver 
River, Indian Creek, Panhandle, Laurel Highlands, Rachel Carson, Five Star 
and Montour offer stunning, natural, suburban and urban views of the metropolitan 
area. The Great Allegheny Passage provides an all natural-trail (non motorized) 
link to Washington, D.C., while the North Country Trail passes through 
the northern suburbs of the city and connects Bismarck, North Dakota to 
the Plattsburgh, New York area, with such cities as Duluth, Minnesota and 
Buffalo, New York in its path. Within the urban core of the city and its 
immediate surroundings the Steps of Pittsburgh offer an urban hiking experience. 
"Urban oasis" parks that bring the wilds of nature into the middle of the 
urban core and feature over a mile of trails within their individual boundaries 
include: Point State, Frick, Highland, Schenley, Riverview, Grandview, 
South Side, Riverfront, Three Rivers, Point of View, and Roberto Clemente. 
Large 500-2,000 acre suburban parks that feature several miles of diverse 
trails each are plentiful throughout the metropolitan area. For hikers/trailblazers 
that desire a historical or cultural element to nature the metropolitan 
area offers the Fort Necessity National Battlefield, Bushy Run Battlefield, 
the Bear Run conservancy containing both Fallingwater and Kentuck Knob, 
the smaller yet hikable Meadowcroft Rock Shelter features pre-Columbian 
archeology. The large urban parks described earlier such as Schenley Park 
includes several historical/cultural sites including Phipps Conservatory 
and proximity to Schenley Plaza, the Cathedral of Learning, Hillman Library 
and the Frick Gallery. Riverview includes the Allegheny Observatory and 
Point includes the Fort Pitt Museum and the remains of Fort Duquesne. For 
true environmentalists and wildlife fans the metro area includes the Jennings 
Environmental Education Center, as well the Allegheny Islands State Park, 
Ohio River Islands National Wildlife Refuge and Ohioplye for hiking and 
water sports. Such teams as the Pittsburgh Triangles have built a small 
but loyal fan base for tennis in the region, being a perennial championship 
contender in the 1970s and winning a world title in 1975. Generations later 
the region still has deep tennis roots with the year-round all-weather 
Mellon Park Tennis Center being a world class facility for the sport, and 
helping to develop natives such as Bjorn Fratangelo, Bonnie Gadusek, Donald 
Johnson and Gretchen Magers in succeeding in international competition 
and rankings. From 1979 to 1984 the city also hosted a yearly international 
tournament, the Pittsburgh Open. Seven Springs Mountain Resort, Hidden 
Valley, Pennsylvania, Wisp Ski Resort and Boyce Park offer skiing with 
both PPG Place and North Park offering ice skating. In 2011, the Pittsburgh 
Penguins created a new public rink in the South Side neighborhood's Southside 
Works called "Penguin Pond". Year round ice skating and skating events 
can be enjoyed at indoor area rinks including the Rostraver Ice Garden, 
Island Sports Center, IceoPlex at Southpointe and Bladerunners Ice Complex. 
Such notable olympians as natives Kristi Leskinen, Kylie Gleason Suna Murray, 
Ron Robertson, Mike Seibert, Suzanne Semanick, Jamie Silverstein and Taylor 
Toth have trained and began their careers at area facilities. There are 
several universities within the city that field athletic teams in NCAA 
Division I including the University of Pittsburgh (often referred to as 
"Pitt"), Duquesne University and Robert Morris University. Of these, the 
University of Pittsburgh is the only school that is a member of the so-called 
"Power Five" conferences that are primary partners in the College Football 
Playoff structure (the Atlantic Coast Conference). Other universities in 
Pittsburgh that field athletic teams include Carnegie Mellon University 
(Division III), Chatham University (Division III), Point Park University 
(NAIA), and Carlow University (NAIA). College football in Pittsburgh dates 
back to the University of Pittsburgh which first organized a football team 
in 1889 and played its first sanctioned game in 1890. In the first half 
of the 20th century, Pitt, Duquesne, and Carnegie Tech (now called Carnegie 
Mellon) all fielded football squads that made "major" bowl game appearances 
from the 1920s through the 1930s. These appearances included Duquesne in 
the 1933 and 1936 Orange Bowl, Carnegie Tech in the 1938 Sugar Bowl, and 
the University of Pittsburgh appearing in four Rose Bowls (1927, 1929, 
1932, 1936) as well as nearby Washington and Jefferson College in the 1922 
Rose Bowl.[48] In particular, Pitt was a national power during this era, 
claiming 8 national championships under the guidance of coaching legends 
such as Pop Warner and Jock Sutherland. More recently, the Panthers won 
another National Championship in 1976 and competed for several more through 
the 1980s. Multiple inductees into the College Football Hall of Fame played 
at Pitt, including Dan Marino, Tony Dorsett, Mike Ditka, and Larry Fitzgerald.[49] 
Pitt is the only university in Western Pennsylvania to still play college 
football at the highest level, the Football Bowl Subdivision, while Duquesne 
and Robert Morris have football teams that compete in the Football Championship 
Subdivision, and Carnegie Mellon fields a Division III football team. Three 
Pittsburgh universities, the University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University, 
and Robert Morris University, compete in NCAA Division I basketball. Pitt 
and Duquesne are the traditional basketball powers in the city, but all 
three universities have made multiple appearances in the National Invitation 
Tournament and NCAA Tournament. Pitt claims two pre-NCAA tournament National 
Championships in 1928 and 1930 [3] while Duquesne won the NIT title in 
1955, its second straight trip to the NIT title game. Since the 2000–2001 
season, a team from the region has always reached a post-season tournament, 
with Pitt having won multiple Big East Conference championships and having 
appeared in nine consecutive NCAA Tournaments, advancing to the Sweet 16 
four times and the Elite Eight once. In the years 1941, 1964, 1980, 1981, 
1982, 1989, 1992 and 2008, two of the city's universities sent teams to 
tournaments; in 2009 and 2010, all three universities earned bids to post 
season tournaments. Pitt women's basketball has also made recent appearances 
in the NCAA Tournament.[50] A rivalry game between Pitt and Duquesne, termed 
the City Game, is played annually between the two schools' men's and women's 
basketball teams, as well as their baseball teams. Along with college football 
and men's and women's basketball, the area universities compete in many 
additional sports. The University of Pittsburgh also fields NCAA Division 
I teams in baseball (its oldest sport first played in 1869[51]), cross 
country, gymnastics, track and field, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, 
tennis, volleyball, and wrestling.[52] The Duquesne Dukes, in addition 
to many of the sports above, also participates in Division I lacrosse, 
golf, and rowing.[53] Robert Morris University fields Division I teams 
in men's and women's hockey, among other sports.[54] Pittsburgh also hosts 
several annual major sporting events, including the: The city's vibrant 
rivers have attracted annual world title competitions of the Forrest Wood 
Cup in 2009 and the Bassmaster Classic in 2005. Annual events continue 
during the winter months at area ski resorts such as Boyce Park, Seven 
Springs, Hidden Valley and Wisp as well as ice skating at PPG Place and 
North Park. A Formula-1 ChampBoat Series race, the Pittsburgh Three Rivers 
Regatta, which is the largest inland regatta in the country during July 
at Point State Park.[55] There is also an annual large rowing regatta, 
the Head of the Ohio, which was founded in 1987 and is one of the largest 
inland regattas in the United States.[56] The Pittsburgh Vintage Grand 
Prix, the last remaining vintage automobile race run on city streets in 
the United States, is held annually at Schenley Park.[57][58] For 30 years 
Pittsburgh has also hosted a large 10K and 5K road race, the Richard S. 
Caliguiri City of Pittsburgh Great Race, which attracts nearly 10,000 athletes
