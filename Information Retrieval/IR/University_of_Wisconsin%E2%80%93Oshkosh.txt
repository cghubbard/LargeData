The University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh[3] (also known as UW Oshkosh) is the 
third-largest university in Wisconsin, United States.[4] As part of the 
University of Wisconsin System, UW Oshkosh offers bachelor, master, and 
doctoral degrees in an annual on- and off-campus enrollment of nearly 14,000. 
UW Oshkosh moves forward with a plan to differentiate it as a research-enhanced 
public university. The goal of the university is to further leverage the 
intellectual capital on the campus and focus on research, while also staying 
true to its core mission of delivering quality education. In 1871 the school 
opened as Oshkosh State Normal School, Wisconsin's third teacher-training 
school. Oshkosh Normal was the first state normal school in the United 
States to have a kindergarten. The university was renamed Oshkosh State 
Teachers College in 1927, Wisconsin State College–Oshkosh in 1951, and 
Wisconsin State University–Oshkosh in 1964. It became part of the University 
of Wisconsin System in 1971 and gained its current name. On November 21, 
1968 there were two demonstrations involved in and referred to as 'Black 
Thursday'. The fist demonstration occurred during the morning by mostly 
black students at Wisconsin State University–Oshkosh, that occupied the 
Presidents office, protesting against the lack of black faculty and black-oriented 
courses,[5] they refused to leave, damaged the Presidents office, destroyed 
furniture and office records. The students were arrested by baton-wielding 
riot police when they refused to leave.[6][7][8] News coverage of the first 
demonstration was minimal unlike the National and International television 
and live reporting coverage of the second demonstration by 400 white students 
who occupied the Wisconsin State University–Oshkosh Reeves Student Union 
cafeteria in the early evening. Oshkosh Police contacted the President 
of Wisconsin State University–Oshkosh Student Assembly who entered the 
student union while all Oshkosh police remained outside including Oshkosh 
riot police standing offset around the glass floor to ceding windows of 
the Reeves Student Union cafeteria. The President of the Student Assembly 
spoke briefly to the students and convinced them to all follow him out 
of the student union as as he had suggested, onto the street opposite Reeves 
Student Unions and returned to their housing units as he also suggested, 
averting any arrests or violence. No students were arrested or later expelled. 
Until the 1960s the Wisconsin State University–Oshkosh student body was 
almost exclusively white as were the Faculty. The Wisconsin State University–Oshkosh 
administration at the time has been described as "conservative, paternalistic" 
and "ruled by elderly white males in the twilight of their careers".[9] 
As result of the first demonstration the university expelled 94 students, 
almost all black, from the first 'Black Thursday' demonstration. The first 
Black Thursday demonstration was marked in a campus exhibit in 2008–09. 
The UW-Oshkosh Library Archives hold the material from the second Black 
Thursday demonstration of November 21, 1968 as well as news reports and 
television videos. The university has been expanding in capacity and infrastructure. 
Student population and campus changed little through the 1980s and 1990s. 
Since 2005, the institution has undertaken several green building projects 
and a Growth Agenda for new programs, faculty hiring and increased student 
population. In 2007, the Student Recreation and Wellness Center added a 
student-funded facility to the university waterfront, which garnered an 
Innovative Architecture and Design award from Recreation Management Magazine.[10] 
In 2010, the campus opened a refurbished dining hall as its new Student 
Success Center. The building consolidated student services into a single 
location. It is designed to be one of the most energy efficient buildings 
in the state, with a geothermal ground source heating system installed 
beneath a nearby parking lot. The campus has three major buildings under 
construction in 2010.[needs update] A new academic building (Sage Hall), 
the first since 1971, will house the College of Business and allied departments 
from the College of Letters and Science, including Psychology, Geography, 
and Environmental Studies. It is designed to use less than half the energy 
of similar buildings on campus, and to generate 10% of its energy from 
renewable technologies.[11] A new residence hall (Horizon Village) will 
replace three older buildings to provide suite-style accommodations. The 
building's green features include geothermal and solar technologies.[12] 
The third facility is the first commercial-scale dry fermentation anaerobic 
biodigester in the Americas, a waste-to-energy plant that will produce 
up to 10% of the campus electricity and heat.[13] UW-Oshkosh is the second-largest 
purchaser of renewable energy in Wisconsin, and ranks 23rd among U.S. colleges 
and universities in renewable energy use.[14] UW-Oshkosh's Model United 
Nations program has won over 30 Outstanding Delegation awards at the National 
Model United Nations. [15] Since 2003 the men's club volleyball team has 
finished in the top five every year except 2008 at the National Intramural 
Recreational Sports Association (NIRSA) championships. In 2005, the team 
finished second,[16] and first in 2006,[17] 2007 and 2011.[18] The small 
Division 3 team won back to back to back NCVF Division 1 men's club volleyball 
national championships in 2014, 2015 and 2016.[19] The baseball program 
appeared in 5 Division III championship games between 1985 and 1994.[20] 
There have been eight Titans players to play in Major League Baseball: 
Jim Magnuson, Dan Neumeier, Jim Gantner, Dorian "Doe" Boyland, Gary Varsho, 
Terry Jorgensen, Jarrod Washburn, and Jack Taschner. In 2012, the UW Oshkosh 
Titans football team had its best season in program history. The Titans 
advanced to the NCAA Division III Semi-finals before falling to St. Thomas 
in St. Paul, Minnesota. The Titans finished with a 13-1 (7-0 WIAC) record 
and as the #4 team by d3football.com. Nate Wara was selected as a first 
team all-American at the quarterback position, he is the first Titan football 
player to achieve all-American status. Head coach Pat Cerroni was named 
2012 CaptainU Coach of the Year, and was a finalist for the Liberty Mutual 
Coach of the Year. Assistant Head Coach John O'Grady was named the 2012 
NCAA Division III Coordinator of the Year by FootballScoop. The men's basketball 
program was in the NAIA Men's Basketball Championships in 1960, 1963, 1967, 
and 1968;[21] and the NCAA Division III Men's Basketball Championship in 
1996-1998, and 2002-2003.[22] The women's basketball program played in 
the NCAA Division III Women's Basketball Championship every year from 1990–1992, 
and again from 1994-2000. In 1995, they reached the Final Four, and the 
following year, won the tournament entirely.[23] The women's gymnastics 
program won the AIAW Championship for Division III in 1980, the NAIA national 
women's gymnastics championship in 1986, and National Collegiate Gymnastics 
Association championships in 1989 and 2007. The men's gymnastics program 
won NAIA gymnastics championships under Titans Hall of Fame coach Ken Allen 
in 1973, 1974, and then 5 straight years from 1978 to 1982. In addition, 
they won the NCAA Men's Gymnastics championship in Division II in 1980, 
1981, and 1982, before the two divisions were merged in 1984.[24] The women's 
track and field team has won the Division III outdoor championship in 1990, 
1991, 1995, 1996, 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2011. They won the Division III 
indoor championship in 1994, 1996, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2011, and 2013. The 
Titans finished as runners-up in the 1989, 1992, 1999, 2005, 2009, 2010 
and 2012 at the Division III outdoor championships, and finished as runners-up 
in the 1990, 1991, 1992, 2002, 2010 and 2012 at the Division III indoor 
championships. The women's cross country team won the NCAA Division III 
Championship in 1987, 1988, 1991, and 1996, and were runners-up in 1989, 
1990, and 1995.[25] The men's track and field team won both the Division 
III Indoor and Outdoor Championships in 2009 and were runners-up in the 
NCAA Division III Indoor Track and Field meet in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2013. 
The men's cross country team won the NCAA Division III Championship in 
1988, 1989, 1990, and 2002.[26] The women's softball program went to the 
World Series in 1988. They also made NCAA tournament appearances in 2007 
and 2008 coming up one game short of the World Series after losing the 
regional championship game to conference rival Wisconsin-Eau Claire. Since 
Cindy Suess took over the program in 2005, the Titans have won an average 
of 27 games per season and have yet to record a losing season. The main 
on-campus sports facility is Kolf Sports Center, which contains facilities 
for basketball, indoor track, and volleyball. Other events held there include 
commencement ceremonies, concerts, and regional conventions. Both Titan 
Stadium (the football/soccer/outdoor track venue) and Tiedemann Field (the 
baseball/softball field) are located across the Fox River, 1.3 miles from 
campus. A recent multimillion-dollar renovation was completed with support 
of the Oshkosh community. The best attended sporting events at Titan Stadium 
are for the two Oshkosh public high school football teams that use it as 
their home field. Fraternities (As of Spring 2016) and Sororities (As of 
Spring 2013) The school's newspaper is the multiple award winning Advance-Titan. 
The Advance-Titan is a weekly publication produced by the students at UW 
Oshkosh. It was founded in 1894 by students and faculty. You can read the 
Advance-Titan online at advancetitan.com. The school has a radio station, 
WRST-FM 90.3 which is located in the Arts & Communications building. The 
call letters stand for "Radio Station of the Titans." The station carries 
Wisconsin Public Radio and student programming. The school's student-media 
outlets produce young sports writing and broadcasting talent. Titan TV, 
the school's television channel, for a while was the only NCAA Division 
III school to telecast all home football and men's and women's basketball 
games complete with live pre-game, halftime, and post-game shows. Three 
locations on the campus have been listed on Registered Historic Places. 
Three buildings on the original campus comprise this historic district. 
Dempsey Hall serves as the administration center of the campus. Harrington 
Hall hosts geology classes. Swart Hall, completed in 1928, is used by the 
mathematics, social work, and sociology departments and houses the Center 
for Economic Education. It was originally used as a lab school where student 
teachers taught kindergarten through ninth grade students. Harrington Hall 
Swart Hall Moses Hooper moved to Oshkosh in 1863, and started construction 
of the house in 1882. It was located at the north edge of the Wisconsin 
State Normal School at Oshkosh. It cost approximately $20,000 to build. 
Hooper moved into his new residence on October 31, 1883. The structure 
had modern amenities including hot water heat and running water. The interior 
was painted by local painters Frank Waldo and Gustav Behncke. The house 
was sold on September 20, 1900 to Dr. Charles W. Oviatt, a surgeon who 
paid $18,000 for the property. After Oviatt's death in 1912, his heirs 
sold the house and grounds to the State Normal School Regents in 1913 with 
the agreement that the heirs could live in the house until June 1914.[28] 
The house was first used by the school as a women's dormitory, the first 
on campus. Because the dormitory operated at a loss, school president Polk 
discontinued the venture in 1932. After considering dismantling the building, 
Polk started renting the house from the school in 1934. The following three 
presidents of the school also resided in the house, ending with President 
Penson in 1989. The University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh Foundation moved its 
office in the house the following year.[28] The Oviatt House was placed 
on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.[28] William E. Pollock 
managed OshKosh B'Gosh. He had Fluor Brothers construction company build 
the house in 1920 for $19,000. The yard included a three-car garage, garden, 
and fishing pond. Pollock lived in the house from 1920 until 1937. He sold 
the house on a land contract, but the house was returned to him after the 
contract was unfulfilled. Pollock then donated the house to the Oshkosh 
State Teachers College in 1943.[29] The college turned the residence into 
a women's dormitory which could house up to 32 co-eds. In the 1960s it 
was used as an honors dormitory until closing in 1967. From 1967 until 
1970 it housed the College of Nursing offices. When the College of Nursing 
was relocated to a new building, the structure was taken over by the Alumni 
Association, who have occupied it since 1970. It is occasionally used for 
special functions.[29] Notable visitors have included President Jimmy Carter, 
United Nations ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Edward Albee.[29] The 
house is designed as a Mediterranean Revival style house with Italian and 
Spanish motif. The entrance has an ornate semi-circular wrought iron door 
leading into a large foyer. The front entry hall opens into a large living 
room and a smaller parlor. A formal staircase rises to an open landing 
and to a study. The second story bedrooms are used as offices for Alumni 
and Foundation staff. The rear consists of a formal dining room, kitchen, 
and pantry. The building has three chimneys capped with campaniles that 
resemble Italian bell towers. The residence's exterior is framed by concrete 
planters and topped by a wrought iron balcony outside of the second floor 
French windows. The roof is low-pitched red-barrel tile.[29] Helen Farnsworth
