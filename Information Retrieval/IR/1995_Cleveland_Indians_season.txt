The 1995 Cleveland Indians season was the Major League Baseball season 
that led to the Indians returning to the World Series for the first time 
since 1954. In a season that started late by 18 games – giving it just 
144 games – the Indians finished in first place in the American League 
Central Division with a record of 100 wins and 44 losses. This was the 
first team in the history of the American League ever to win 100 games 
in a season that had fewer than 154 games.[1] The most outstanding pitcher 
for the Indians was their relief pitcher, José Mesa, who finished second 
in the voting for the American League's Cy Young Award. Mesa pitched in 
62 games; he led the league by being the finishing pitcher in 57 games, 
and he saved a league-leading 46 games, even though he pitched just exactly 
64 innings. Mesa was the winning pitcher in three games, and he lost none. 
Mesa's earned run average was a microscopic 1.13. Mesa only gave up eight 
earned runs, one unearned run, and three home runs in the entire regular 
season. The most outstanding batter and everyday player for the Indians 
was their left fielder, Albert Belle, who finished second in the voting 
for the American League's Most Valuable Player Award. Belle played in 143 
of the 144 games, and had more than 50 doubles and 50 home runs. Belle 
led the league in runs scored (121), runs batted in (126), doubles (52), 
home runs (50), total bases (377), and slugging percentage (0.690). Belle 
had 173 hits and a batting average of 0.317. The second most outstanding 
batter and everyday player for the Indians was their right fielder, Manny 
Ramirez. Ramirez played in 137 games, scored 85 runs, batted in 107 runs, 
hit 26 doubles and 31 home runs, had 149 hits, and batted 0.308. On a team 
that was led by its outfielders in batting, the Indian's center fielder 
Kenny Lofton, playing in just 118 games, also had 149 hits, scored 93 runs, 
batted 0.310, and led the American League with 13 triples and 54 stolen 
bases. This was Lofton's fourth of five consecutive years leading the American 
League in stolen bases. Lofton also won a Gold Glove in the outfield. However, 
Lofton only hit seven home runs and batted in 53 runs. The Indians won 
the Central Division by an overwhelming 30 games over the second-place 
Kansas City Royals, and they went into the playoffs going strong. In their 
American League Division Series, the Indians defeated the Boston Red Sox 
in a three games to none sweep. Next, in the American League Championship 
Series, the Indians defeated the Seattle Mariners four games to two. The 
Indians' starting pitcher, Orel Hershiser, was voted the American League 
Championship Series' Most Valuable Player. In the World Series, the Indians 
faced the Atlanta Braves, who had finished the regular season with a 90 
– 54 record, had defeated the Colorado Rockies three games to one in the 
National League Division Series, had swept the Cincinnati Reds four games 
to none in the National League Championship Series. The Braves had the 
National League's Cy Young Award winner in Greg Maddux, who finished the 
season with a 19 – 2 won-loss record and a 1.63 earned run average as a 
starting pitcher. Maddux also finished in third place in the voting for 
Most Valuable Player. In the World Series, the Indians lost the World Series 
to the Braves by four games to two, with the Braves winning all three games 
in Atlanta, and the Indians winning two out of three games in Cleveland. 
The World Series Most Valuable Player was the starting pitcher Tom Glavine 
of the Braves, who won two games in the Series. The Indians led the Majors 
in nearly every offensive category, including runs scored (840), hits (1,461), 
home runs (207), runs batted in (803), batting average (.291) and slugging 
percentage (.479). They also struck out the fewest times (766) of all 28 
MLB teams.[6][7] They also had one of the most formidable pitching staffs 
in the AL, allowing the second-fewest hits (1,261), finishing with the 
best ERA (3.83), the fewest runs allowed (607), fewest earned runs allowed 
(554), the most saves (50) and the fewest intentional walks (16).[7] [1]
