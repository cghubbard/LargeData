Félix Antonio Rodríguez (born September 9, 1972) is a Dominican former 
Major League Baseball relief pitcher. Rodríguez was signed by the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in 1989 as a free agent, originally as a catcher. He batted .291 
as a catcher, but his arm was so impressive that the organization moved 
him to the mound in 1993. During the northern hemisphere winter, the Dodgers 
sent Rodríguez to play for their Australian affiliate the Adelaide Giants 
in the Australian Baseball League in 1993 as part of his pitching development. 
He began his major league career in 1995 with the Dodgers, was on waivers 
throughout 1996, was picked up by the Cincinnati Reds, where he played 
in 1997. In 1998, he played for the Arizona Diamondbacks, then with the 
San Francisco Giants from 1999-2004. He started 2004 with the Giants before 
being traded to the Philadelphia Phillies. It was with the Giants that 
Rodriguez had several crucial postseason failures. In Game 2 of the 2000 
NLDS, he allowed a two run homer to Edgardo Alfonzo of the Mets in the 
9th inning and later an RBI single in the 10th inning that won the game 
for the New York Mets. In Game Two of the 2002 World Series, Rodriguez 
gave up a two run home run to Tim Salmon of the Angels in the eighth inning 
that proved to be the deciding blow. In Game Six of the 2002 World Series, 
he gave up the rally-starting home run to Angels first baseman Scott Spiezio 
that started the rally that lost the game for the Giants—a game in which 
the Giants had led 5-0 at one point. The resulting loss is often cited 
as the decisive turning point in the series. And in the 2003 NLDS Rodriguez 
gave up a key two out, two run single in Game 4 that eventually proved 
the difference in the game that won the series for the Florida Marlins. 
He began 2005 with the New York Yankees, after being traded from the Phillies 
for center fielder Kenny Lofton in a one-for-one deal. In spring training 
2006, he signed with the Montreal Expos, he was designated for assignment 
at the end of the season. He signed a minor league deal with the Florida 
Marlins but didn't make the team and was released on March 28. He finished 
the 2007 season playing for the Kia Tigers in the Korea Baseball Organization. 
In 2008, Rodríguez played for the Camden Riversharks in the independent 
Atlantic League and had a 1.09 ERA in 32 games. In February 2009, he signed 
a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox.[1] Though he did not make 
the spring training roster and was released. He returned to the Camden
