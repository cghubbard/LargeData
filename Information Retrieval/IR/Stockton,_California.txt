Stockton is the county seat of San Joaquin County located in the Northern 
portion of the U.S. State California and the San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland, 
CA Combined Statistical Area, an extension of the Bay Area.[18] Stockton 
was founded by Captain Charles Maria Weber in 1849 after he acquired Rancho 
Campo de los Franceses. The city is named after Robert F. Stockton,[19] 
and it was the first community in California to not have a name of Spanish 
or Native American origin. The city is located on the San Joaquin River 
in the northern San Joaquin Valley and had an estimated population of 315,592 
as of 2016. Stockton is the 13th largest city in California and the 63rd 
largest city in the United States. It was named an All-America City in 
1999, 2004 and again in 2015. Built during the California Gold Rush, Stockton's 
seaport serves as a gateway to the Central Valley and beyond. It provided 
easy access for trade and transportation to the southern gold mines. Stockton 
has been the location of the oldest university in California, University 
of the Pacific since 1923. As a result of the 2008 financial crisis, Stockton 
was the second largest city in the United States to file for bankruptcy 
protection. Stockton successfully exited bankruptcy in February 2015. Stockton 
is situated amidst the farmland of California's San Joaquin Valley, a subregion 
of the Central Valley. In and around Stockton are thousands of miles of 
waterways, which make up the California Delta. Interstate 5 and State Route 
99, inland California's major north-south highways, pass through the city. 
State Route 4 and the dredged San Joaquin River connect the city with the 
San Francisco Bay Area to its west. Stockton and Sacramento are California's 
only inland sea ports. According to the United States Census Bureau, the 
city occupies a total area of 64.8 square miles (168 km2), of which 61.7 
square miles (160 km2) is land and 3.1 square miles (8.0 km2) (4.76%) is 
water. When Europeans first visited the Stockton area, the Yatchicumne, 
a branch of the Northern Valley Yokuts Indians, occupied the Stockton area. 
They built their villages on low mounds to keep their homes above regular 
floods. A Yokuts village named Pasasimas was located on a mound between 
Edison and Harrison Streets on what is now the Stockton Channel in downtown 
Stockton.[20] The Siskiyou Trail began in the northern San Joaquin Valley. 
It was a centuries-old Native American footpath that lead through the Sacramento 
Valley over the Cascades and into present-day Oregon.[21] Europeans and 
Americans started to arrive in the area after gold was found in northern 
California, starting the Gold Rush in 1848. When Captain Charles Maria 
Weber, a German immigrant, decided to try his hand at gold mining in late 
1848, he soon found that supplying gold-seekers was a more profitable venture.[22] 
As an alien, Weber could not secure a land grant directly, so he formed 
a partnership with William Gulnae. Born in New York, Gulnae had married 
a Mexican woman and sworn allegiance to Mexico, which then ruled California. 
He applied in Weber's place for a land grant of eleven square leagues on 
the east side of the San Joaquin River.[23] Weber acquired the Rancho Campo 
de los Franceses Mexican land grant and founded Stockton in 1849. Captain 
Weber built the first permanent residence in the San Joaquin Valley on 
a piece of land now known as Weber Point.[20] During the California Gold 
Rush, Stockton developed as a river port, the hub of roads to the gold 
settlements in the San Joaquin Valley and northern terminus of the Stockton 
- Los Angeles Road. During its early years, Stockton was known by several 
names, including "Tuleburg", "Fat City," "Mudville", and "California's 
Sunrise Seaport".[2] Weber decided on "Stockton" in honor of Commodore 
Robert F. Stockton. Stockton was the first community in California to have 
a name that was neither Spanish nor Native American in origin.[1] Thousands 
of Chinese came to Stockton from the Kwangtung province of China during 
the 1850s due to a combination of political and economic unrest in China 
and the discovery of gold in California. After the Gold Rush, many worked 
for the railroads and land reclamation projects in the Sacramento–San Joaquin 
River Delta and remained in Stockton. By 1880, Stockton was home to the 
third-largest Chinese community in California. Discriminatory laws, in 
particular the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, restricted immigration and 
prevented the Chinese from buying property. The Lincoln Hotel, built in 
1920 by the Wong brothers on South El Dorado Street, was considered one 
of Stockton's finest hotels of the time. Only after the Magnuson Act was 
repealed in 1962, American-born Chinese were allowed to buy property and 
own buildings.[24][25] The city was officially incorporated on July 23, 
1850, by the County Court, and the first city election was held on July 
31, 1850. In 1851, the City of Stockton received its charter from the State 
of California. Early settlers included gold seekers from Asia, Africa, 
Australia, Europe, the Pacific Islands, Mexico and Canada. The historical 
population diversity is reflected in Stockton street names, architecture, 
numerous ethnic festivals, and in the faces and heritage of a majority 
of its citizens. In 1870, the Census Bureau reported Stockton's population 
as 87.6% white and 10.7% Asian. Many Chinese were immigrating to California 
as workers in these years, especially for the Transcontinental Railroad.[26] 
Benjamin Holt settled in Stockton in 1883 and with his three brothers founded 
the Stockton Wheel Co., and later the Holt Manufacturing Company. On Thanksgiving 
Day, Nov. 24, 1904, Holt successfully tested the first workable track-laying 
machine, plowing soggy San Joaquin Valley Delta farmland.[27] Company photographer 
Charles Clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled 
like a caterpillar, and Holt seized on the metaphor. "Caterpillar it is. 
That's the name for it!" [28] On April 22, 1918 British Army officer Colonel 
Ernest Dunlop Swinton visited Stockton while on a tour of the United States. 
The British and French armies were using many hundreds of Holt tractors 
to haul heavy guns and supplies during World War I, and Swinton publicly 
thanked Benjamin Holt and his workforce for their contribution to the war 
effort.[29] During 1914 and 1915, Swinton had advocated basing some sort 
of armored fighting vehicle on Holt's caterpillar tractors, but without 
success. (Although Britain did develop tanks, they came from a separate 
source and were not directly derived from Holt machines).[30] After the 
appearance of tanks on the battlefield, Holt built a prototype, the Gas-electric 
tank, but it did not enter production. The extensive network of waterways 
in and around Stockton was fished and navigated by Miwok Indians for centuries. 
During the California Gold Rush, the San Joaquin River was navigable by 
ocean-going vessels, making Stockton a natural inland seaport and point 
of supply and departure for prospective gold-miners. From the mid-19th 
century onward, Stockton became the region's transportation hub, dealing 
mainly with agricultural products. By 1931 the Stockton Electric Railroad 
Company operated forty streetcars over 28 miles of track.[31] Stockton 
is the site of the first Sikh temple in the United States; Stockton Gurdwara 
Sahib opened on October 24, 1912. It was founded by Baba Jawala Singh and 
Baba Wasakha Singh, successful Punjabi immigrants who farmed and owned 
500 acres (202 ha) on the Holt River.[32] In 1933, the port was modernized, 
and the Stockton Deepwater Channel, which improved water passage to San 
Francisco Bay, was deepened and completed. This created commercial opportunities 
that fueled the city's growth. Ruff and Ready Island Naval Supply Depot 
was established, placing Stockton in a strategic position during the Cold 
War.[33] During the Great Depression, the town's canning industry became 
the battleground of a labor dispute resulting in the Spinach Riot of 1937.[34] 
During World War II, the Stockton Assembly Center was built on the San 
Joaquin County Fairgrounds, a few blocks from what was then the city center. 
One of fifteen temporary detention sites run by the Wartime Civilian Control 
Administration, the center held some 4,200 Japanese Americans removed from 
their West Coast homes under Executive Order 9066, while they waited for 
transfer to more permanent and isolated camps in the interior of the country. 
The center opened on May 10, 1942 and operated until October 17, when the 
majority of its population was sent to Rohwer, Arkansas. The former incarceration 
site was named a California Historical Landmark in 1980, and in 1984 a 
marker was erected at the entrance to the fairgrounds.[35] In September 
1996, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission announced the final closure 
of Stockton's Naval Reserve Center on Rough and Ready Island. Formerly 
known as Ruff and Ready Island Naval Supply Depot, the island's facilities 
had served as a major communications outpost for submarine activities in 
the Pacific during the Cold War. The site is slowly being redeveloped as 
commercial property.[36] Historically an agricultural community, Stockton's 
economy has since diversified into other industries, which include telecommunications 
and manufacturing. Stockton's central location, relative to both San Francisco 
and Sacramento, as well as its proximity to the state and interstate freeway 
system, together with its comparatively inexpensive land costs, have prompted 
several companies base their regional operations in the city. Beginning 
in the late 1990s, under the mayorship of Gary Podesto, Stockton had commenced 
some revitalization projects.[citation needed] Newly built or renovated 
buildings include the Bob Hope Theater, Regal City Centre Cinemas and IMAX, 
San Joaquin RTD Downtown Transit Center, Lexington Plaza Waterfront Hotel, 
Hotel Stockton, Stockton Arena, San Joaquin County Administration Building, 
and the Stockton Ballpark.[citation needed] The "sunken parking lot" in 
front of the Hotel Stockton was transformed in the late 1990s into a public 
space named "Dean DeCarli Waterfront Square." The area is designed to include 
a variety of spaces and flexible uses: a sunken plaza, shade structure, 
numerous trees and planters, stadia seating, bench seating, viewing platforms, 
a weir at the west end, and a cascading waterfall at the east end. DeCarli 
Square has become a popular urban place hosting music, art and religious 
events, festivals, Farmers Markets, and social gatherings.[citation needed] 
A new Downtown Marina and adjacent Joan Darah Promenade were added along 
the South Shore of the Stockton Deep Water Channel during 2009. Various 
public art projects were also installed throughout the area (see Stockton's 
public art section).[citation needed] Other projects under consideration 
by the city council as of January 2009 include South Shore housing, the 
revitalization of the Robert J. Cabral Train Station neighborhood, bridges 
across the Stockton Deep Water Channel, and a new San Joaquin County Court 
House.[citation needed] The Stockton real estate market was disproportionately 
affected by the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis, and the city led 
the United States in foreclosures for that year, with one of every 30 homes 
posted for foreclosure.[37] From September 2006 to September 2007, the 
value of a median-priced house in Stockton declined by 44%.[38] Stockton's 
Weston Ranch neighborhood, a subdivision of modest tract homes built in 
the mid-1990s, had the worst foreclosure rate in the area according to 
ACORN, a national advocacy group for low and moderate-income families. 
Stockton found itself squarely at the center of the United States' speculative 
housing bubble in the 2000s. Real estate in Stockton more than tripled 
in value between 1998 and 2005, but when the bubble burst in 2007, the 
ensuing financial crisis made Stockton one of the hardest-hit cities in 
United States.[39] Stockton housing prices fell 39% in the 2008 fiscal 
year, and the city had the country's highest foreclosure rate (9.5%) as 
well. Because of the shrinking economy, Stockton also had an unemployment 
rate of 13.3% in 2008, one of the highest in the United States. Stockton 
was rated by Forbes in 2009 as America's fifth most dangerous city because 
of its crime rate.[39] In 2010, mainly due to the aforementioned factors, 
Forbes named it one of the top three worst places to live.[40] Following 
regional losses to the economy due to the 2008 financial crisis, in July 
2012, Stockton became the largest city in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy 
protection. It was surpassed by Detroit in July 2013. The city approved 
of a plan to exit bankruptcy in October 2013,[41] and voters approved a 
sales tax on November 5, 2013 to help fund the exit.[42] The collapse in 
real estate valuations had a negative effect on the city's revenue base. 
On June 28, 2012, Stockton filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.[43] On April 
1, 2013, a federal judge accepted the bankruptcy application.[44][45] On 
April 1, 2013, Judge Christopher M. Klein,United States Bankruptcy Court 
Easter District of California, Sacramento Division, ruled that Stockton 
was eligible for bankruptcy protection. The Stockton bankruptcy case has 
lasted more than two years and received nationwide attention. While there 
are many possible factors that led to the Chapter 9 filing including the 
real estate crash and failed city projects, Stockton is being watched along 
with Detroit to see whether a Federal judge will override State law and 
rule that pensions for municipal employees could be at risk. At issue are 
the contractual obligations to CalPERS that cities throughout California 
have undertaken. CalPERS receives special protection from the California 
state constitution. On October 4, 2013, Stockton City Council approved 
a bankruptcy exit plan by a six-zero vote [41] to be filed with the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of California, Sacramento. Voters approved 
a 3/4-cent sales tax which would help fund the bankruptcy exit on November 
5, 2013.[42] If Federal courts rule on this aspect of the bankruptcy exit 
plan it could set a precedent for a state with one of the largest municipal 
bond markets in the country. According to the US constitution and laws 
passed by the US Congress all bankruptcies in the US are administered by 
Federal courts according to Federal law with some allowances for State 
law.[46] On October 30, 2014, a federal bankruptcy judge approved the city's 
bankruptcy recovery plan, thus allowing the city to continue with the planned 
pension payments to retired workers.[47] The City officially exited from 
Chapter 9 bankruptcy, February 25, 2015. Stockton has a Mediterranean climate 
(Köppen Csa), with hot, dry summers and mild winters. In an average year, 
about 80% of the 13.8 inches (351 mm) of precipitation falls from October 
through April. Located in the Central Valley, the temperatures range is 
much greater than in the nearby Bay Area. Tule fog blankets the area during 
some winter days. Stockton lies in the fertile heart of the California 
Mediterranean climate prairie delta, about equidistant from the Pacific 
Ocean and the Sierra Nevada. At the airport, the highest recorded temperature 
was 115 °F (46 °C) on July 23, 2006, and the lowest was 16 °F (−9 °C) on 
Jan. 11, 1949. There are an average of 82 days annually with high temperatures 
of 90 °F (32.2 °C) or higher, and 18 of 100 °F (37.8 °C) or above; 19 days 
see low temperatures at or below freezing.[48] The wettest year was 1983 
with 26.65 inches (677 mm) and the lowest year was 1976 with 5.6 inches 
(140 mm).[49] The most rainfall in one month was 8.22 inches (209 mm) in 
February 1998 and the most rainfall in 24 hours was 3.01 inches (76 mm) 
on Jan. 21, 1967. There are an average of 55 days with measurable precipitation. 
Only light amounts of snow have been recorded; the most was 0.3 inches 
(7.6 mm) in February 1976.[49] The 2010 United States Census[53] reported

Annual Financial Report,[61] the top employers in the city are: Stockton 
hosts several live music venues, including: The Bob Hope Theatre, formerly 
known as the Fox California Theatre in downtown Stockton, built in 1930, 
is one of several movie palaces in the Central Valley. Bob Hope often came 
to Stockton to visit close friend and billionaire tycoon Alex Spanos, who 
donated much of the money to revitalize the theater after Hope's death. 
The University of the Pacific Faye Spanos Concert Hall often hosts public 
performances, as does the Stockton Memorial Civic Auditorium. The Warren 
Atherton Auditorium at the Delta Center for the Arts on the campus of the 
San Joaquin Delta College is a 1,456-seat theater with a 60-foot (18 m) 
proscenium and full grid system.[66] The Stockton Empire Theater is an 
art deco movie theater that has been revitalized as a venue for live music. 
Founded in 1951, the Stockton Civic Theatre offers an annual series of 
musicals, comedies and dramas. It maintains a 300-seat theater in the Venetian 
Bridges neighborhood. The company also hosts the annual Willie awards for

works by late 19th and early 20th century artists. Notable among them are 
paintings by Albert Bierstadt, whose interpretations of the natural grandeur 
of the Sierra Nevada, Yosemite Valley, and other California landscapes 
are internationally renowned .[20] The Stockton Arts Commission, an advisory 
body to the City Council, oversees a city endowment fund that provides 
grants to local artists and arts and cultural organizations. It sponsors 
the annual arts awards. The commission also serves as an advocate and information 
clearinghouse for the arts and cultural community. Stockton public art 
projects include: With over 77,000 trees, the City of Stockton has been 
labeled Tree City USA some 30 times according to Arborday.org.[20] Stockton

softball leagues including Stockton Girls Softball Association, and Port 
City Softball League, each having several hundred members.[citation needed] 
Rowing Regatta featuring Junior, Collegiate and Master Level Rowing & Sculling 
Competition is organized by the University of the Pacific[74] annually 
on the Stockton's Deep Water Channel. Teams from throughout Northern California 
compete in this Olympic sport which is also the oldest collegiate sport 
in the United States. Stockton hosts a wide variety of sports events every 
year: from resident hockey, baseball and soccer games through basketball

& Country Club.[citation needed] Stockton is one of a handful of cities 
that lays claim to being the inspiration for Casey at the Bat.[75] The 
University of the Pacific was the summer home of the San Francisco 49ers 
Summer Training Camp from 1998 through 2002. Stockton is also the base 
of UFC fighters Nick and Nate Diaz. Nick, a middleweight in the UFC, is 
the former WEC and Strikeforce Welterweight champion,[76] while Nate is 
one of the top 5 ranked UFC lightweights[77] and the winner of The Ultimate 
Fighter 5.[78] Both brothers are Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belts under 
Cesar Gracie[79] and operate a school in Stockton which teaches Brazilian 
jiu-jitsu to children and youth.[80][81] The City of Stockton has a small 
children's amusement park, Pixie Woods. Pixie Woods opened in 1954 and 
has since received more than one million visitors.[82] As of January 1, 
2013, the current mayor of Stockton is Anthony Silva (Republican). On November 
8, 2016, Michael D. Tubbs was elected mayor. Tubbs, 26, is the first African 
American mayor of Stockton. He will take office in January 2017. The City 
Council consists of the following members as of January 1, 2013:[83] The 
current form of government is a city manager council:[84] Scott Carney 
Stockton is also part of San Joaquin County, for which the government of 
San Joaquin County is defined and authorized under the California Constitution 
and law as a general law county. The county government provides countywide 
services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, 
vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social 
services. The county government is primarily composed of the elected five-member 
Board of Supervisors and other elected offices including the Sheriff, District 
Attorney, and Assessor, and numerous county departments and entities under 
the supervision of the County Administrator.[citation needed] The Stockton 
Police Department was founded on August 14, 1850. The first chief of police 
was City Marshal W. W. Willoughby. The city marshal was authorized to hire 
no more than 20 men as day and night policemen. He was required to structure 
his department with a police captain, an assistant captain and two sergeants. 
The first station house was located on the corner of Center Street and 
Market Street. In February 1861, the city council created the position 
of Chief of Police. His annual salary was $900 and the chief would be elected 
by the public. On May 6, 1862, George E. Taber was elected the first Chief 
of Police for the city of Stockton. In 1886 Stockton police officers were 
required to wear blue uniforms and a six-point star badge. In October 1889 
a new uniform was decided upon by the chief. The uniform frock coat worn 
by Oakland police officers was cost around $50 or $60 each. The San Francisco 
style star was chosen as the badge and was made of silver. Each badge cost 
$5. By 1907 the department had grown to 18 members, which included the 
chief, officers and clerks. The population was around 25,000 and the police 
department handled about 600 cases per year. In 1908 the chief required 
all police officers to appear for a day of field efficiency testing; this 
included each officer running 100 yards and a 50-yard revolver practice. 
On March 1, 2012 Eric Jones was sworn in as Chief of Police. The city cut 
its police force by more than 20% during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, 
but voters approved a sales tax on November 5, 2013 that provided funds 
to hire an additional 120 police officers.[85][86] Stockton has a reputation 
being a dangerous place to live. In 2012, the City of Stockton was the 
10th[58] most dangerous city in America, reporting 1,417 violent crimes 
per 100,000 persons, well above the national average, and 22 murders per 
100,000 (above the average of 4.7).[citation needed] In 2013, violent crime 
lessened to 1,230.3 crimes per 100,000 population, making it 19th on the 
list of the most dangerous cities.[87] Stockton has experienced a high 
rate of violent crime, reaching a record high of 71 homicides in 2012 before 
dropping to 32 for all of 2013.[87][88] Stockton Police Chief Eric Jones 
credited 2013's drop in the murder rate to Operation Ceasefire, a gun violence 
intervention strategy pioneered in Boston and implemented in Stockton in 
2012,[89] combined with a federal gun and narcotics operation.[90] On January 
17, 1989, the Stockton Police Department received a threat against Cleveland 
Elementary School from an unknown person. Later that day, Patrick Purdy, 
who was later found to be mentally ill, opened fire on the school's playground 
with a semi-automatic rifle, killing five children, all Cambodian or Vietnamese 
refugees, and wounding 29 others, and a teacher, before taking his own 
life. The Cleveland Elementary School shooting received national news coverage 
and is sometimes referred to as the Cleveland School massacre.[91] Then-Mayor 
Barbara Fass' subsequent work on gun control received national attention 
and sparked nationwide efforts that sought to ban semi-automatic rifles 
like the one used in the shooting.[citation needed] The Stockton Fire Department 
was first rated as a Class 1 fire department by the Insurance Services 
Office in 1971. In 2005, all 13 of the city's stations met the National 
Fire Protection Association standard of a 5-minute response time.[92] In 
2009, it had 13 fire stations and over 275 career personnel.[93] Due in 
part to staffing levels that placed five staff on ladder companies and 
four staff on engines, it was one of only 57 departments among 44,000 to 
receive the Class 1 rating in 2010.[94] The department maintained this 
rating until 2011, when during the city's Chapter 9 bankruptcy proceedings 
and following a Civil Grand Jury investigation, the city reduced staffing 
levels from 220 full time staff to 177, and the 2011 budget from $59 million 
to $40 million. The department was cut by 30%.[95] The bankruptcy was due 
in part to a 1996 decision made by the city to provide firefighters with 
free health care after retirement, which they later expanded to all city 
employees. The benefit gradually grew into a $417 million liability.[96] 
As of 2016[update], the department consists of 12 firehouses that house 
12 Engine Companies and three Truck Companies. In 2015 the Fire Department 
responded to over 40,000 emergency calls for service, including more than 
300 working structure fires. The department is one of the busiest in the 
United States.[97] According to the city's most recent[when?] Comprehensive 
Annual Financial Report, the city reported a significant deficit with US$443.9 
million in revenue and US$485.4 million in expenditures. The report cited 
US$1,903.5 million in total assets and US$679.9 million in total liabilities, 
with $203.5 million in cash and investments.[98] Former Fairfield, California 
City Manager Kevin O'Rouke was hired as Interim City Manager after the 
retirement of Palmer,[who?] until the Stockton City Council announced that 
former County of Sonoma Administrator Bob Deis as permanent replacement 
and who assumed the position in July 2010. Dies had a difficult time while 
City Manager. He called the last three years and four months an "interesting 
ride,"[99] making unpopular decisions but was praised by some critics.[citation 
needed] Deis retired to Santa Rosa, CA. The city council appointed former 
Deputy City Manager Kurt O. Wilson as interim City Manager on November 
1, 2013, and he was made City Manager in January 2014.[citation needed] 
Stockton is part of four public school districts: Stockton Unified School 
District, Lincoln Unified School District, Lodi Unified School District, 
and Manteca Unified School District. There are more than 40 private elementary 
and secondary schools, including Saint Mary's High School. Stockton is 
also home to public charter school systems including Aspire Public Schools, 
Stockton Collegiate and Venture Academy.[citation needed] The University 
of the Pacific moved to Stockton in 1924 from San Jose. The university 
is the only private school in the United States with less than 10,000 students 
enrolled that offers eight different professional schools. It also offers 
a large number of degree programs relative to its student population.[100] 
The men's Pacific Tigers basketball team has been in NCAA Tournament nine 
times. The Tigers have played their home games at the Alex G. Spanos Center 
since 1982, prior to that playing at the Stockton Memorial Civic Auditorium 
since 1952. The campus has been used in the filming of a number of Hollywood 
films (see below), partly due to its likeness to East Coast Ivy League 
universities.[citation needed] Also located in Stockton are: Stockton is 
centrally located with access to: Due to its location at the "crossroads" 
of the Central Valley and a relatively extensive highway system, Stockton 
is easily accessible from virtually anywhere in California. Interstate 
5 and State Route 99, California's major north-south thoroughfares, pass 
through the city limits. The east-west highway State Route 4 also passes 
through the city, providing access to the San Francisco Bay Area as well 
as the Sierra Nevada and its foothills. Stockton is the western terminus 
of State Route 26 and State Route 88, which extends to the Nevada border. 
In addition, Stockton is within an hour of Interstate 80, Interstate 205 
and Interstate 580.[citation needed] Stockton is served by San Joaquin 
Regional Transit District [101] Stockton is also connected to the rest 
of the nation through a network of railways. Amtrak and Altamont Commuter 
Express (ACE) both make stops in Stockton, with Amtrak providing passenger 
access to the rest of the nation. Union Pacific and BNSF Railway, the two 
largest railroad networks in North America both service Stockton and its 
port via connections with the Stockton Terminal and Eastern Railroad and 
Central California Traction Company, who provide local and interconnecting 
services between the various rail lines. Recently,[when?] BNSF Railway 
opened a much needed $150 million intermodal freight transport facility 
in southeast Stockton, which satisfies long-haul transportation needs.[citation 
needed] Stockton is served by Stockton Metropolitan Airport, located on 
county land just south of city limits. The airport has been designated 
a Foreign Trade Zone and is mainly used by manufacturing and agricultural 
companies for shipping purposes. Since airline deregulation, passenger 
service has come and gone several times. Domestic service resumed on June 
16, 2006, with service to Las Vegas by Allegiant Air.[102] The days of 
service/number of flights were expanded a few months later due to demand. 
Air service to Phoenix began in September 2007. On July 1, 2010, Allegiant 
Air implemented non-stop service to and from Long Beach, California.[102] 
With respect to international service, in 2006 Aeromexico had plans to 
provide flights to and from Guadalajara, Mexico, but the airport's plan 
to build a customs station at the airport was initially rejected by the 
customs service. However, the possibility of building this station is currently 
a continuing matter of negotiation between the airport and the customs 
service, and Aeromexico has indicated a continuing interest in eventually 
providing service. Ground transportation is available from Hertz, Enterprise, 
Yellow Cab and Aurora Limousine.[citation needed] The Port of Stockton 
is a fully operating seaport approximately 75 nautical miles (86 mi; 139 km) 
east of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Set on the San Joaquin 
River, the port operates a 4,200 acres (17 km2)[103] transportation center 
with berthing space for 17 vessels up to 900 ft in length.[104] As of 2014, 
the Port of Stockton had 136 tenants[105] and is served by BNSF & UP Railroads.[106] 
The port also includes 1.1 million square feet (102,000 m²) of dockside 
transit sheds and shipside rail track and 7.7 million square feet (715,000 
m²) of warehousing.[107] Adjacent to the port is Rough and Ready Island, 
which served as a World War II–era naval supply base until it was decommissioned 
during the Base Realignment and Closure process in 1995. In addition, several 
radio stations from nearby San Francisco, Sacramento and Modesto are receivable 
in Stockton. As part of the Sacramento-Stockton-Modesto television market, 
Stockton is primarily served by stations based in Sacramento, but may carry 
some San Francisco Bay area television stations' airwaves. These are listed 
below, with the city of license in bold: A number of motion pictures have 
been filmed in Stockton.[109] Over the years, filmmakers have used Stockton's 
waterways[110] to stand in for the Mississippi delta, the surrounding farmland 
as the American plains and Midwest, and Pacific's campus[111] as an Ivy 
League college. Some of the movies filmed in Stockton include: Stockton 
received an All-America City award from the National Civic League twice, 
in 1999 and 2004. 2004's award was based on a 60-member delegation's presentation 
titled "The Dream Lives On!", and featured three community-driven projects: 
Community Partnership for Families, Downtown Alliance, and the Peace Keeper 
Program.[144] The 1999 award recognized the Apollo Night Talent and Performing 
Series, the conversion of the Stockton Developmental Center into an off-campus 
center for the California State University at Stanislaus, and the LEAP 
(Let Education Attack Pollution) program.[145] Sunset magazine named Stockton 
Best Tree City in the western United States in March 2002,[146] and "Best 
of the West Food Fest" in March 2000. Stockton contains 49 city, state, 
and national historical landmarks, dating as far back as 1855. In February 
2009, and again in February 2011, Stockton was named "America's Most Miserable 
City" by Forbes, reflecting the city's issues with commuting times, violent 
crime rates, income tax levels, and unemployment rates. Stockton had placed 
second in this listing in 2008.[147] Stockton was home to the world's first 
radio disc jockey, Ray Newby. In 1909, at 16 years of age, Newby began 
regularly playing records on a small transmitter while a student at Herrold 
College of Engineering and Wireless, located in San Jose, California, under 
the authority of radio pioneer Charles "Doc" Herrold.[148][149] We used 
popular records at that time, mainly Caruso records, because they were 
very good and loud; we needed a boost... we started on an experimental 
basis and then, because this is novel, we stayed on schedule continually 
without leaving the air at any time from that time on except for a very 
short time during World War I, when the government required us to remove 
the antenna... Most of our programming was records, I'll admit, but of 
course we gave out news as we could obtain it...[148] Stockton has seven 
sister cities:[150] In 2013 the City of Stockton released a nearly 1 billion 
dollar 5 year capital improvement plan.[151] However, the capital improvement 
plan was still inadequate to address ongoing maintenance and upkeep of 
Stockton's public infrastructure. In April 2016, City Public Works Director 
Gordon Mackay estimated maintenance funding shortfalls for roads, parks,
