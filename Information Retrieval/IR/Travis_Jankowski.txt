Travis Paul Jankowski (born June 15, 1991) is an American professional 
baseball center fielder for the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). As a sophomore for the Stony Brook Seawolves baseball team in 2011, 
Jankowski earned first-team All-America East Conference honors after hitting 
.355, setting a school record for stolen bases and going the entire season 
without an error.[1] That summer, Jankowski was invited to play for the 
Bourne Braves, where he led the Cape Cod Baseball League in hits, runs, 
and triples, earning league most valuable player honors.[1][2] In 2012, 
Jankowski had a break out year, breaking his previous school record for 
stolen bases and setting school records in batting average, hits, runs, 
and triples.[1] In leading the Seawolves to their first ever College World 
Series appearance, Jankowski earned First Team All-American and America 
East Player of the Year honors.[1][3] Jankowski was drafted in the first 
round of the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft by the San Diego Padres; 
he was signed by the Padres' Northeast Scouting Director, Jim Bretz.[3][4] 
After just two games with the AZL Padres, he was promoted to the Fort Wayne 
TinCaps, the Padres' Class A affiliate, for the remainder of the 2012 season. 
With the TinCaps, Jankowski hit .282 with 17 stolen bases in 59. He spent 
the 2013 season with the Class A-Advanced Lake Elsinore Storm.[5] Jankowski 
was promoted to the Padres from the El Paso Chihuahuas on August 19, 2015. 
He replaced Will Venable who had been traded to the Texas Rangers the previous 
day. As the starting center fielder in his MLB debut in a 9–3 win over 
the St. Louis Cardinals at Petco Park on August 21, Jankowski singled off 
John Lackey in each of his first two plate appearances, drove in a run 
with his second hit and scored on Yangervis Solarte's two-run fifth-inning 
homer.[6] He is the first Stony Brook Seawolves position player in the 
majors and the first Padre since Tony Gwynn to record at least two hits 
and a RBI in his big-league debut.[7] Jankowski stole home plate twice 
within the month of August 2016. His first came when Wil Myers was caught 
in a rundown between first and second base at the back end of a double 
steal attempt in the eighth inning of a 7–3 home victory over the Milwaukee 
Brewers on August 1.[8] An initial ruling of fielder's choice was changed 
to a stolen base the following day. Jankowski stole home again when he 
broke for the plate on Eric Fryer's return throw to Antonio Bastardo in 
the eighth inning of a 4–0 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park
