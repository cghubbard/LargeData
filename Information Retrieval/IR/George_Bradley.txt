George Washington Bradley (July 13, 1852 – October 2, 1931), nicknamed 
"Grin", was an American Major League Baseball player who was a pitcher 
and infielder. He was 5'10.5" and weighed 175 lbs.[1] Bradley threw the 
first official no-hit, no-run game in major league history.[2] He pitched 
for the St. Louis Brown Stockings in the club's victory over the Hartford 
Dark Blues on July 15, 1876. The score ended 2-0 without a hit being allowed 
by Bradley. That year, he completed 63 of St. Louis' 64 games, winning 
45 and leading the league with a 1.23 earned run average. He also threw 
16 shutouts, setting a record that has not been broken.[2] After 1876, 
Bradley was not as effective as a pitcher and played mostly other positions 
after 1879. He was involved in professional baseball for 30 years, 19 of 
them with the Philadelphia Athletics. In 1883, he was the team's regular 
third baseman and also went 16-7 on the mound to help the A's win the American 
Association championship.[3] In 1887, he served as a player-manager for 
the Nashville Blues of the Southern League.[4] Bradley became a Philadelphia 
police officer following his baseball career. He died in Philadelphia[1] 
at his home. At the time of his death, he was retired on a pension from 
the police department which he had received beginning in September 1931.
