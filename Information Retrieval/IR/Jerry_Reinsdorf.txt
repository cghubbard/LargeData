Jerry M. Reinsdorf (born February 25, 1936) is a CPA, lawyer and an owner 
of the NBA's Chicago Bulls and the MLB's Chicago White Sox. He started 
his professional life as a tax attorney with the Internal Revenue Service. 
He has been the head of the White Sox and Bulls for over 25 years. He made 
his initial fortune in real estate, taking advantage of the Frank Lyon 
Co. v. United States decision by the United States Supreme Court which 
allowed economic owners of realty to sell property and lease it back, while 
transferring the tax deduction for depreciation to the title owner. As 
the owner and Chairman of the Chicago Bulls since 1985, he has turned the 
franchise into a lucrative business that won six NBA Championships in the 
1990s (1991–1993 and 1996–1998). He is controversial for his involvement 
(along with Jerry Krause) in breaking up the championship team by not hiring 
back key personnel such as Phil Jackson and Michael Jordan. He hired Jordan 
as a baseball player during his sabbatical from basketball. He also moved 
the Bulls from Chicago Stadium to the United Center. As a baseball owner 
since 1981, he has brought success to the White Sox franchise. The franchise 
made the playoffs in 1983 for the first time since 1959 and won the World 
Series in 2005 for the first time since 1917. He moved the White Sox from 
Comiskey Park to New Comiskey Park and then renamed the new park U.S. Cellular 
Field. In both sporting endeavors, he has developed a reputation as an 
anti-labor union hardliner. Since the early 1990s, he has been considered 
one of the most, if not the most, influential basketball owners. He has 
been influential in instituting the salary cap and revenue sharing. On 
April 4, 2016, Reinsdorf was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball 
Hall of Fame as a contributor.[3] Reinsdorf was born to a Jewish family 
in Brooklyn, New York.[4] He attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn,[5] 
and he was the son of a sewing machine salesman.[6] A lifelong baseball 
fan who grew up in the shadows of Ebbets Field,[7] Reinsdorf was in the 
stands the day Jackie Robinson debuted for the Brooklyn Dodgers, breaking 
the color barrier which prevented black players from serving on Major League 
teams.[8] Reinsdorf earned a bachelor's degree from George Washington University 
in Washington, D.C.[9] where he became a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi.[10] 
He subsequently moved to Chicago in 1957.[9] Reinsdorf became a CPA and 
lawyer[11] as well as a registered mortgage underwriter and a certified 
review appraiser.[9][12] He leveraged a full scholarship offer from the 
University of Chicago Law School into a scholarship from the Northwestern 
University School of Law.[7] His first job after graduating from Northwestern 
in 1960 was a tax delinquency case of Bill Veeck who at the time owned 
the White Sox.[6] In 1964, Reinsdorf went into private practice. He developed 
a specialty in real estate partnership tax shelters. He sold his business 
interests in the real estate partnership in 1973 and formed Balcor, which 
raised US$650 million to invest in buildings under construction. He sold 
Balcor in 1982 for $102 million to Shearson Lehman Brothers, the investment 
banking and brokerage arm of American Express.[6] However, he continued 
to be President of the company for several years thereafter.[13] In 1981 
he was wealthy enough to purchase the White Sox for $19 million.[6] The 
purchase was brokered by American National Bank who arranged for a limited 
partnership.[14] He followed previous eccentric White Sox owners Charles 
Comiskey, who was known as a miser, and Veeck, who was known as a prankster 
who gutted the team by trading away promising prospects.[15][16] Soon after 
buying the White Sox, he signed Greg Luzinski and Carlton Fisk. He also 
tripled the team promotional budget and increased the number of team scouts 
from 12 to 20. By the 1983 Major League Baseball season the White Sox made 
the playoffs with the best record in the Major Leagues.[6][16] The team 
initially signed a television deal with the newly founded Sportsvision 
under the new leadership of Chairman Reinsdorf and Vice Chairman Eddie 
Einhorn, but that arrangement quickly fizzled.[17] Einhorn continued as 
Vice Chairman of the White Sox until his death in 2016.[18] In 1985, following 
in the footsteps of Einhorn who had purchased a United States Football 
League franchise in 1984,[19] he purchased the Chicago Bulls as part of 
a syndicate for US$16 million and quickly turned the team from one that 
averaged 6,365 fans per game at the 17,339-seat Chicago Stadium in 1985 
into one with an 8,000-person season ticket waiting list.[6] He did so 
by drafting Horace Grant and Scottie Pippen, and trading for Bill Cartwright 
to join John Paxson and Michael Jordan under the tutelage of head coach 
Doug Collins. In 1989, the team signed Phil Jackson as the final piece 
of the championship puzzle.[20] From November 20, 1987 through Jordan's 
1999 retirement the Bulls sold out every game.[21] In the months prior 
to the purchase, Milwaukee businessman Marvin Fishman had been awarded 
a $16.2 million judgment against the Bulls.[22] Fishman had been illegally 
blocked from purchasing the team in 1972.[23] Reinsdorf purchased the team 
from an ownership group that included Lamar Hunt, George Steinbrenner, 
Walter Shorenstein, Jonathan Kovler, Lester Crown, Philip Klutznick, and 
the estate of Arthur Wirtz,[19] and he held a $9.2 million controlling 
interest in the team.[21] Reinsdorf's share of 56.8% of the team was purchased 
from Klutznick, Steinbrenner, Shorenstein and the estate of Wirtz.[24] 
His purchase ended an era in which the Bulls were managed by committee 
with decisions by conference call, verdicts by vote.[25] Reinsdorf acquired 
his majority interests on March 11, 1985 and Kovler sold his 7% stake in 
the team on January 29, 1986, bringing Reinsdorf's interest to 63%.[26][27] 
The following week Reinsdorf ousted Rod Thorn as general manager and replaced 
him with Jerry Krause.[28] "The North Siders always tended to look down 
on South Siders. . . Part of being a White Sox fan is you hate the Cubs." 
The White Sox have won American League regular season Division Championships 
in 1983, 1993, 2000, 2005 and 2008 under Reinsdorf and they won the 2005 
World Series.[4] In addition, they were in first place of the central division 
at the conclusion of the strike-shortened 1994 Major League Baseball season.[4] 
The World Series victory made him only the third owner in the history of 
North American sports to win a championship in two different sports. The 
baseball championship boosted the value of the franchise to over $300 million.[15] 
When Reinsdorf signed Jordan after Jordan's announcement that he wanted 
to play baseball, many thought Jordan's drawing power provided an ulterior 
motive.[30] Reinsdorf, however, had tried to convince Jordan not to give 
up basketball,[31] but he did not attempt to make Jordan the highest paid 
player in the game like some feel he should have.[32] As a basketball owner, 
he has been described by Time as a "cheapskate",[33] a reference they also 
use for his baseball persona.[34] As of 1995, the time when Scottie Pippen 
was eager to either be traded or be rid of Krause, he had never renegotiated 
a contract.[32] As a baseball owner, he has had a reputation as one of 
the most militant, anti-union, hard-line owners.[12][35][36] Newsweek described 
him as "one of the hardest heads in the 1994 baseball strike".[32] In the 
baseball offseason between the 1992 and 1993 seasons, he completely abstained 
from the free agent market.[37] Reinsdorf was one of the last holdouts 
to the 1996 labor agreement that instituted the salary cap while retaining 
arbitration rights for the players.[38][39] His 1996 signing of Albert 
Belle made news because of his widely publicized general opposition to 
spiraling player salaries.[12] The $55 million signing was a turning point 
in the decision by the baseball owners to agree to revenue sharing.[40] 
The signing also made Reinsdorf the employer of the highest paid Major 
League Baseball player and highest paid professional basketball player 
(Jordan) at the same time.[12] Reinsdorf had just re-signed Jordan after 
the 1995–96 NBA season.[41] However, Jordan had been underpaid most of 
his career,[42] and Reinsdorf, who did not feel he could justify the $30 
million salary from a business standpoint,[43] immediately realized he 
was going to soon feel buyer's remorse.[44] Even his most successful baseball 
team was not highly paid: when the White Sox won the 2005 World Series, 
Reinsdorf had the 13th highest payroll of the 30 Major League Baseball 
teams.[34] After Reinsdorf purchased the team in 1981, the team experienced 
erosion of fan and media support which led to moving the team.[16] He complained 
about old Comiskey Park with its foible such as numerous obstructed view 
seats and threatened to move the White Sox.[45] Among his threats was moving 
the team to Itasca or Addison, Illinois in DuPage County.[45][46] Reinsdorf, 
through his real estate business purchased 100 acres (400,000 m2) in Addison.[47] 
Chicago Mayor Harold Washington lobbied the Illinois legislature,[45] and 
subsequently then-Illinois Governor James R. Thompson promoted a package 
of incentives to retain the team in Chicago. The state floated bonds to 
build New Comiskey Park and let Reinsdorf keep all parking and concession 
revenues, as well as the $5 million per year from 89 skyboxes.[6] Reinsdorf 
and Chicago Blackhawks owner, William Wirtz contributed $175 million to 
fund the construction of the largest arena in the United States.[48] When 
the United Center opened in 1994 all of the skyboxes were leased for up 
to eight years.[49] As per the collective bargaining agreement, Reinsdorf 
was allowed to exclude 60% of luxury suite revenue from "basketball-related 
income" and thus it is not part of the revenue sharing income.[50] "Jerry 
is clearly the most powerful [Major League Baseball] owner." Reinsdorf 
is a powerful baseball owner who in 1988 stopped the sale of the Texas 
Rangers and later influenced the sale of the Seattle Mariners.[6] Edward 
Gaylord and Gaylord Entertainment Company had first attempted to buy the 
Rangers in 1985.[51] Reinsdorf was also said to be largely responsible 
for the ousting of Fay Vincent as the Commissioner of Baseball in 1992.[52][53] 
He had previously undermined Vincent by employing Richard Ravitch as the 
league's labor negotiator at a salary higher than Vincent's.[6][54] By 
the early 1990s, Reinsdorf and acting Baseball commissioner (as well as 
Milwaukee Brewers owner) Bud Selig had assumed baseball's mantle of power 
from Atlanta Braves owner, Ted Turner, and New York Yankees owner, George 
Steinbrenner, who had in turn taken over the sport from Brooklyn/Los Angeles 
Dodgers owner, Walter O'Malley, St. Louis Cardinals owner, Gussie Busch, 
and Oakland Athletics owner, Charlie O. Finley.[55] In the 1980s, Reinsdorf, 
Bud Selig and the American League President colluded to dissuade the Philadelphia 
Phillies from signing Lance Parrish who was a Detroit Tigers free agent.[56] 
During the strike, Reinsdorf, who was an anti-union hard-liner,[36] was 
so pessimistic that he did not expect baseball to resume until the 1996 
Major League Baseball season.[57] In the early 1990s he was able to get 
new stadiums (United Center and U.S. Cellular Field) for his teams.[58] 
Some fans and columnists have accused Reinsdorf of breaking up the championship 
Bulls team after their third straight title and sixth in eight years, claiming 
the Bulls could have competed for more titles with Michael Jordan, Scottie 
Pippen and good support from the rest of the team that in the eight-year 
span included Dennis Rodman, Horace Grant, Toni Kukoč, Ron Harper, BJ Armstrong, 
and coach Phil Jackson. Some accounts claim that because Jackson feuded 
with both Reinsdorf and Krause and because both Jordan and Pippen were 
linked to Jackson, the team was broken up.[33] Forbes describes the scenario 
as an example of owner greed.[59] Many note that Phil Jackson's decision 
not to return as coach and Jordan's retirement during the 1998–99 NBA season 
lockout impacted the decisions of several players on whether to return 
to Chicago.[60] Krause and Reinsdorf had held out hope that they could 
convince Jackson and Jordan to return and thus had introduced Tim Floyd 
as President of Chicago Bulls Basketball Operations instead of head coach.[61] 
Reinsdorf had made it clear to Jackson that he was wanted back.[62] Reinsdorf 
was one of two bidders for the Phoenix Coyotes that would commit to not 
relocating the team.[63] On July 29, 2009 Reinsdorf and his group were 
approved for ownership of the Coyotes for $148 million.[64] The official 
sale is set to occur during bankruptcy auction which will take place September 
10.[65] In August 2009, it was reported that Jerry Reinsdorf & Ice Edge 
LLC had dropped its bid for the Coyotes, leaving only Balsillie and the 
NHL as bidders for the team.[66] The NHL bid ultimately prevailed, however 
the league has stated it wishes to re-sell the franchise as soon as possible. 
On March 24, 2010, it was reported that Reinsdorf was once again a possible 
buyer for the Phoenix Coyotes.[67] Reinsdorf had been working out an arrangement 
to make the deal more feasible with the municipality of Glendale, Arizona.[68] 
As late as August 2011, negotiations between Reinsdorf and the City of 
Glendale were still in process for the purchase of the Coyotes.[69] However, 
in 2013, the Coyotes were sold to IceArizona, a group of investors that 
did not include Reinsdorf. Reinsdorf is largely responsible for the revenue 
sharing of the internet rights of Major League Baseball in which all teams 
have shared equally since Major League Baseball Advanced Media (known as 
BAM) was established in 2000.[70] Reinsdorf also endeavored to sell the 
naming rights to the New Comiskey Park to U.S. Cellular in a $68 million 
20-year deal that funded a 7-year $85 million overhaul of the stadium that 
ended prior to the 2008 Major League Baseball season. The overhaul included 
the removal of top rows of the upper deck, replacement of the baby blue 
seats with traditionally-colored green ones and dozens of other upgrades.[71] 
Prior to the seven-year overhaul, the 2001 White Sox barely broke even 
financially with a $700,000 operating profit on revenues of $101.33 million.[72] 
Reinsdorf won a major revenue sharing legal battle with other NBA owners 
over the Chicago Bulls broadcasts on WGN-TV. The 55 game schedule on the 
superstation for an audience of 35 million competed with the NBA broadcasts, 
but Reinsdorf was permitted to maintain the contract.[6] As recently as 
2004, the Bulls continued to be the NBAs most profitable team, earning 
$49 million in operating income and having an estimated valuation of $356 
million.[73] Reinsdorf feels that if Major League Baseball Players Association 
chief, Donald Fehr, had not opposed steroid testing, baseball would have 
taken a stand against steroid use much sooner. He feels that in the end 
this delayed action will cost some players election into the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame.[74] Reinsdorf has been involved (along with the likes of 
Playboy Enterprises' Christie Hefner) in Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley's 
initiative to improve standardized test scores in the 559 Chicago Public 
Schools.[75] He has been involved in other extensive charitable work including 
those of CharitaBulls and White Sox Charities. His philanthropy and community 
development have been notable in the Near West Side community area near 
the United Center.[9] Twice the White Sox Charities has donated $1 million 
to the Chicago Park District with particular attention to funding baseball 
and softball fields.[4] Reinsdorf was inducted into the Appleton, Wisconsin 
Baseball Hall of Fame on August 5, 2006 in a ceremony at Fox Cities Stadium 
prior to that evening's game between the Midwest League Wisconsin Timber 
Rattlers and Beloit Snappers. He was so recognized because a former Minor 
League club, the Appleton Foxes, was a Chicago White Sox affiliate and 
won three consecutive Midwest League Championships in the early years of 
Reinsdorf's ownership.[76] In 2011, Reinsdorf received a Jefferson Award 
for Public Service. He was recognized for "Greatest Public Service Benefiting 
the Disadvantaged" based on philanthropic efforts through the Chicago White 
Sox Charities and CharitaBulls.[77] He has been a member of the board of 
directors of Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., the Northwestern University 
Law School Alumni Association, LaSalle Bank, Equity Office Properties and 
numerous other corporations and charities. He currently serves as a Life 
Trustee of Northwestern University. Reinsdorf and his wife, Martyl (née 
Rifkin), have four children and eight grandchildren.[9][78] Throughout 
the years Reinsdorf has been active in the affairs of baseball, serving 
on the Executive Council and Ownership, Long Range Planning, Restructuring, 
Expansion, Equal Opportunity, Strategic Planning, Legislative and Labor 
Policy Committees of Major League Baseball, he also serves on the Boards 
of MLB Advanced Media and MLB Enterprises.[4] In 2013, Reinsdorf partnered 
with Mark Sullivan, Noah Kroloff, Dennis Burke, David Aguilar, and John 
Kaites to found Global Security and Innovative Strategies.[79] Ruttman,
