The Cleveland Indians' 2005 season was a season in American baseball. It 
involved the Indians attempting to win the American League Central division. 
They had a very good September (with 17 wins and 9 losses), and went into 
a season-closing series with the Chicago White Sox with a chance to tie 
the White Sox for the division lead, but lost three close games to finish 
6 games behind the White Sox, who were the eventual World Series winners.
