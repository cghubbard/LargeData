The 1925 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 44th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and the 34th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
77–76 during the season and finished 4th in the National League. Early 
in the 1925 season, second baseman Rogers Hornsby was named player-manager 
of the Cardinals, replacing Branch Rickey, whose professorial style of 
managing had gone over the heads of most of his players.[citation needed] 
Immediately after taking over, Hornsby told his fellow players, "Let's 
cut this baloney and just play ball." They went 64–51 the rest of the way. 
The 1925 season also brought Hornsby's second triple crown. He posted a 
.403 batting average with 39 home runs and 143 RBI. He was named the National 
League's Most Valuable Player, having barely missed the award in 1924. 
His .756 slugging percentage that year is the highest in the National League 
during the 20th century. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other
