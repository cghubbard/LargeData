The Pearson Cup was an annual midseason Major League Baseball rivalry between 
former Canadian rivals, the Toronto Blue Jays and Montreal Expos. Named 
after former Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, it was originally created 
to raise money for minor league baseball in Canada. In later years, it 
was incorporated into the interleague baseball schedule. The series began 
in 1978, and ran until 1986.[1] Due to a strike, no game was played in 
1981.[2] In 2003 the series was revived as part of the Blue Jays-Expos 
interleague rivalry.[3] It continued on into the 2004 season, before the 
Expos moved to Washington, D.C. and became the Washington Nationals. The 
cup is now on display in the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in St. Mary's, 
Ontario. From 1978â€“1986, the Cup was awarded after a one-game exhibition, 
that had no effect on the major league standings. The game was suspended 
in 1987 as the two teams could not find a mutually agreeable date to play 
the game.[4] There was discussion about reviving the game in the preseason, 
or playing it in another Canadian city such as Vancouver, but this never 
took place.[5][6][7] However, the Jays did play a number of exhibition 
games at BC Place in Vancouver including three game series against the 
Milwaukee Brewers prior to both the 1984 and 1985 seasons[8][9] (the Vancouver 
Canadians were the AAA farm team of the Brewers at the time[10]), as well 
as single games against the Detroit Tigers and Brewers in 1993[11][12] 
and against the Montreal Expos and Seattle Mariners in 1994 in a series 
billed as the "Baseball Classic".[13][14][15][16] The Jays also played 
the Cleveland Indians in an exhibition game at War Memorial Stadium in 
nearby Buffalo, New York in 1987.[17] More recently, the club has hosted 
a pair of exhibition games at Olympic Stadium in Montreal prior to the 
start of the season, New York Mets (2014),[18] Cincinnati Reds (2015),[19] 
Boston Red Sox (2016),[20] and are scheduled to host two versus the Pittsburgh 
Pirates prior to the start of the 2017 season.[21] The club has also discussed 
playing more games at BC Place with the President of the Vancouver Canadians.[22][23][24] 
During the 2003 and 2004 series, the Cup was awarded after a six-game set, 
three in Toronto and three in Montreal.[3] These games did count toward 
the major league standings and were during the regular season. The 1979 
and 1985 games were abandoned as ties due to time constraints; in 1979 
the Expos had to catch an airplane flight,[25] while in 1985 the Jays had 
to catch a flight.[26][27] The Blue Jays and Expos first played meaningful 
baseball in the 1997 season with the introduction of interleague play.[37] 
Originally one game sets, the two teams played home and home series for 
the first time in 1999. The series was a boost to the paltry attendance 
numbers at both the Olympic Stadium in Montreal and the SkyDome in Toronto, 
but failed to become a serious rivalry amongst the players or the fans.[1] 
Some people attribute this to lack of Canadian players on both teams, while 
others point to the general malaise of Canadians with Major League Baseball 
during the late 1990s and early 2000s.[1][38] Major League Baseball put 
the final nail in the Series' coffin by playing the final set between the 
Jays and Expos in San Juan, Puerto Rico instead of Montreal. Major League 
Baseball's intention to boost attendance by playing in San Juan ended up 
resulting in lower attendance than the series had attracted in Montreal 
a year earlier.[39][40][41] The All-Canadian Series ended after 2004 when 
the Expos were relocated and became known as the Washington Nationals.[42][43] 
The Blue Jays won the series 24 games to 19 games, and Toronto also won
