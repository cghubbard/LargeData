William Horlick "Bill" Neukom (born 1942) is a former managing general 
partner of the San Francisco Giants baseball team ownership group. He held 
this position from May 2008 to December 31, 2011 and he was the managing 
partner when the Giants won the World Series in 2010, the first World Series 
win since the team had moved to California in 1958. Prior to holding this 
position, he was President of the American Bar Association in 2007–08.[1] 
He was the principal legal counsel for Microsoft for almost 25 years. He 
was also the Chairman of the Gates law firm in Seattle, now part of K&L 
Gates. He is a member of the Board of Directors of the Pacific Council 
on International Policy.[2] Neukom was born in 1942, seven years before 
his brother, Daniel Neukom, who is a history teacher at Sacramento Country 
Day School.[3] He was raised in the Bay Area community of San Mateo, California. 
He was living in the Bay Area when the Giants moved to San Francisco in 
1958. He graduated from San Mateo High School in 1960. He received an undergraduate 
degree from Dartmouth College in 1964.[4] After receiving his undergraduate 
degree from Dartmouth, Neukom returned to the Bay Area where he received 
a law degree from Stanford Law School in 1967.[5] After completing his 
law degree, Neukom served as a clerk for Judge Theodore S. Turner of the 
King County Superior Court in Seattle in the years 1967–68.[6] By 1977, 
he had joined the Seattle law firm Shidler, McBroom, Gates & Lucas (later 
Preston Gates & Ellis). Neukom's relationship with Microsoft began in 1978 
when managing partner Bill Gates Sr. asked him to advise his son's fledgling 
software business.[4] Neukom started doing legal work for Microsoft when 
the company had just 12 employees. He would continue to be Microsoft's 
lead legal counsel for nearly 25 years.[7] Neukom joined Microsoft as an 
employee in 1985 and thereafter built its corporate law department from 
an initial staff of five to more than 600 attorneys and support personnel.[8] 
He became an Executive Vice President at Microsoft. He spent 17 years as 
Microsoft's general counsel and chief legal officer, managing the company's 
legal, governmental affairs and philanthropic activities.[8] He was actively 
involved in legally defending Microsoft's intellectual property in several 
countries, most notably in Apple v. Microsoft.[6] He also was involved 
in defending Microsoft from a series of complex antitrust suits (i.e. United 
States v. Microsoft).[6] Neukom presided over Microsoft's defeat by the 
U.S. Department of Justice in a case that was referred to as the "trial 
of the century." [10]While at Microsoft, Neukom also directed the company's 
community affairs program, which initiated corporate giving programs including 
the Microsoft Giving Campaign, the Microsoft Matching Gifts Program, and 
the Microsoft Volunteer Program. In 2002 Neukom retired from Microsoft 
as Executive Vice President, Law & Corporate Affairs.[6] After Microsoft, 
Neukom returned to Preston Gates & Ellis as a partner in the firm's business 
law practice.[8] In January 2004 he was named chair of that firm. In 2007 
Preston Gates & Ellis merged with Kirkpatrick and Lockhart of Pittsburgh 
to form the large law firm now named K&L Gates.[8] Neukom no longer is 
affiliated with the firm. Neukom served as president of the American Bar 
Association for a one year term from August 2007 to August 2008.[11] Neukom 
had been an investor in the Giants since 1995 and on May 16, 2008 was named 
the new Managing General Partner for the Giants.[9] He succeeded Peter 
Magowan, who retired at the end of the 2008 season at the age of 66.[12] 
Neukom and other investors purchased a portion of Peter Magowan's ownership 
interest in the team. Neukom became the lead active investor of the team 
following the reduction of Magowan's ownership interest, the death of Harmon 
Burns (a leading investor who died in 2006) and the death of Sue Burns, 
who died in 2009. On September 14, 2011, Bill Neukom announced he was retiring 
as the Managing General Partner and CEO of the San Francisco Giants effective 
January 1, 2012, and he would be succeeded by Giants executive Larry Baer.[13] 
The San Jose Mercury reported anonymous sources saying that Neukom was 
forced out due to differences in the ownership group on how to divide up 
the additional money earned after the Giants won the 2010 World Series.[14] 
The Mercury also reported Giants shareholder Charles Bartlett Johnson purchased 
additional interests in the team, becoming the largest individual shareholder 
at 25%.[15] Between 1996 and 2007, Neukom was a member of the Board of 
Trustees of Dartmouth College and he served as chair of the board from 
2004 to 2007. Three of his children have attended Dartmouth. He is the 
founding donor of The Neukom Institute for Computational Science at Dartmouth 
College, which aims to advance computing resources and applications in 
multiple aspects of the Dartmouth curriculum.[8][16] In 2006 Neukom committed 
to a gift of $20 million for the planned construction of a new academic 
building at Stanford University's law school.[5] The structure, named the 
William H. Neukom Building and opened in 2011, is 65,000 square feet and 
is situated on the existing law school complex.[17] Neukom is the Founder, 
President, and CEO of the World Justice Project. The World Justice Project 
works internationally to strengthen the Rule of Law, aiming to promote
