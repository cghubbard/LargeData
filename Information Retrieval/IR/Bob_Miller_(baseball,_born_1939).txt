Robert Lane Miller (February 18, 1939 – August 6, 1993) was a pitcher in 
Major League Baseball. Miller was never a star pitcher, but his ability 
to fill in as a starter or reliever, as needed, allowed him to have a career 
that spanned 18 years in Major League Baseball. In his diverse journey 
through organized baseball, he played for three World Series champions—the 
1963 Los Angeles Dodgers, 1965 Los Angeles Dodgers and the 1971 Pittsburgh 
Pirates—five league champions and four division winners, as well as for 
four teams that lost 100 or more games in a season.[1] Miller played for 
ten different teams during his major league career, tying a modern-day 
record (since 1900) with Dick Littlefield that has since been broken.[2][3] 
He played with three different teams in each of three different seasons: 
the Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox and Chicago Cubs in 1970; the 
Cubs, San Diego Padres and Pittsburgh Pirates in 1971; and the Padres, 
Detroit Tigers and New York Mets in 1973.[4] Steve Treder of Hardball Times 
described Miller as a "whatever-is-needed utility pitcher".[1] Former teammate 
Roy Hartsfield, who managed the Toronto Blue Jays when Miller was the team's 
pitching coach, called him "The Christian", a nickname he earned "because 
he suffers so much", noting that Miller was a part-time reliever with a 
sore arm, but that "when we came up with some other sore arms on the staff 
he would come in and suffer a few innings."[5] Besides, his 12 consecutive 
losses at the start of the 1962 season with the Mets tied a record since 
broken by Anthony Young.[6] Miller was born in St. Louis, Missouri as Robert 
Lane Gemeinweiser and later changed his last name to "Miller"; the circumstances 
of the name change are unknown.[1] He attended Beaumont High School in 
St. Louis, where he had a 22–1 record pitching for the school's baseball 
team, including a perfect 12–0 record in his senior year. In the 1956 American 
Legion Baseball championships, Miller won all three games for the St. Louis 
Stockhams to lead the team to the national title.[7] After graduating from 
high school as an 18-year-old, Miller was pursued by 15 major league teams 
and chose to sign as a "bonus baby" amateur free agent with the hometown 
St. Louis Cardinals on June 20, 1957, receiving a signing bonus estimated 
at $20,000.[7] As required by the Bonus Rule as it existed when he was 
signed, the Cardinals had to immediately place Miller on their 40-man roster 
and keep him there for two years.[1][4] Miller made his major league debut 
on June 26, less than a week after being signed to the team, pitching the 
final inning of an 11–3 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies, with Miller 
giving up three hits, three walks and three runs.[8] Miller pitched in 
four more games in the 1957 season, seeing a total of nine innings of work, 
all in relief, ending with an earned run average (ERA) of 7.00.[4] With 
changes made to the Bonus Rule after the 1957 season, the Cardinals sent 
Miller down to the minor leagues. He began the 1958 season at the Triple-A 
Rochester Red Wings, but was sent down to the Double-A Houston Buffaloes, 
finishing the season there with an 8–11 record and an ERA of 3.54. He started 
the 1959 season in Rochester, pitching to an 8–12 record and a 3.50 ERA. 
He was promoted back to the Cardinals and appeared in 11 games, all but 
one as a starter, finishing with a 4–3 record and an ERA of 3.31 and threw 
three complete games.[1][4] In 15 games for the Cardinals in 1960 (starting 
seven), Miller ended the season with the same 4–3 record as the previous 
year, this time with an ERA of 3.42.[4] He spent a brief injury-related 
stint with the Double-A Memphis Chicks of the Southern Association, where 
he had a 1–0 record and a 2.45 ERA in three games.[9] Once being called 
back to the Cardinals, he was in the majors for the rest of his career.[1] 
He spent most of the 1961 season as a relief pitcher for the Cardinals, 
appearing in 34 games, all but five in relief, and ending the year with 
a 1–3 record and three saves, with a 4.24 ERA.[4] Miller earned the first 
save of his career on September 20, 1961, pitching the final 2 2⁄3-innings 
of an 11–2 win by the Cardinals against the Los Angeles Dodgers at the 
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, called into the game with one out and bases 
loaded in the bottom of the seventh inning and getting Frank Howard to 
ground into a double play to end the inning and then pitching two perfect 
innings to earn the save.[10] In the 1961 MLB Expansion Draft held on October 
10, 1961, the New York Mets picked Miller as one of three players they 
selected from the Cardinals, joining catcher Chris Cannizzaro and outfielder 
Jim Hickman.[4] Miller was one of four players selected by the team from 
a premium pool of players at the top $125,000 draft price.[11] One of two 
pitchers on the team's inaugural squad sharing the name Bob Miller, Mets 
manager Casey Stengel would call this Bob Miller by the name "Nelson", 
either out of confusion or in order to distinguish him from Bob G. Miller.[1][12] 
Miller was the starting pitcher on the losing end of a no-hitter pitched 
by Sandy Koufax of the Dodgers on June 30, 1962, a 5–0 Mets loss.[13] Miller 
took the loss, his sixth of the season, after giving up four runs (all 
earned) on five hits and a walk in only two-thirds of an inning.[14] In 
losing his first 12 decisions with the Mets, Miller tied a then-Major League 
record for losses by a pitcher at the start of the season.[6] He ended 
the 1962 season with a 1–12 record in 33 games (21 as a starter), and a 
4.89 ERA.[4] Miller's only win that season came in a 2–1 victory over the 
Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field on September 29 in the team's second from 
last game of the season, with Miller pitching his only complete game of 
the season, scattering seven hits and a walk, the only run scoring on a 
home run by Cubs first baseman Ernie Banks.[15][16] His 12 wild pitches 
that season ranked him fifth in the National League, one ahead of Bob Gibson.[17] 
The Mets traded Miller to the Los Angeles Dodgers on November 30, 1962, 
in exchange for Tim Harkness and Larry Burright.[4] On May 8, 1963, Stan 
Musial of the Cardinals hit a home run off of Miller in the fourth inning, 
giving Musial the 1,357th extra base hit of his career, breaking the major 
league record that had been held by Babe Ruth.[18][19] In a game against 
the Milwaukee Braves on August 13, Warren Spahn struck out Miller for the 
2,832nd strikeout of Spahn's career, setting a record for strikeouts by 
a left-handed pitcher that had been held by Rube Waddell since 1910.[20][21] 
Miller finished the 1963 season with a 10–8 record and two saves in 42 appearances, 
an ERA of 2.89 and 125 strikeouts, the most wins in a season in his major 
league career and the only time he exceeded 100 strikeouts. His 23 games 
as starter represented the majority of his appearances and was his only 
season with the Dodgers in which he was primarily a starter; Miller was 
used primarily as a reliever and had only seven starts in his remaining 
four seasons with the team. Miller did not play in the Dodgers four-game 
sweep of the New York Yankees in the 1963 World Series.[4] He had a 7–7 
record and nine saves in 74 appearances (all but two in relief) and a 2.62 ERA 
in 1964.[4] His 74 appearances in 1964 were the most of any pitcher in 
the National League that season.[22] He had a 6–7 record and nine saves 
in 61 appearances and a 2.97 ERA in 1965.[4] His first postseason appearance 
came in relief in two games as part of the Dodgers' 1965 World Series victory 
in seven games over the Minnesota Twins. Miller pitched in the ninth inning 
of the second and sixth games of the series, both of which were 5–1 losses 
to the Twins.[23] Miller had a 4–2 record and five saves in 45 relief appearances 
and a 2.77 ERA in 1966.[4] In the 1966 World Series, in which the Baltimore 
Orioles swept the Dodgers in four games, Miller appeared in the fifth inning 
of the first game and pitched three innings in relief after starter Don 
Drysdale gave up four runs in the game's first two innings.[24] In the 
1967 season, Miller had a 2–9 record with no saves in 52 appearances, with 
his ERA climbing to 4.31.[4] Miller gave up no runs in any of his World 
Series appearances with the Dodgers.[4] The Dodgers traded Miller on November 
28, 1967 to the Minnesota Twins, together with Ron Perranoski and Johnny 
Roseboro, in exchange for Mudcat Grant and Zoilo Versalles, in a trade 
made at baseball's winter meeting held in Mexico City.[25] Miller had an 
0–3 record and two saves in 45 appearances (all in relief) and an ERA of 
2.74 in the 1968 season.[4] In 1969, Miller ended with a 5–5 record and 
three saves in 48 appearances (including 11 starts) with a 3.02 ERA.[4] 
The Twins faced the Baltimore Orioles in the 1969 American League Championship 
Series, the first year of intraleague playoffs with the split of each league 
into Eastern and Western divisions. In the best three-out-of-five format, 
the Twins lost the first two games and called on Miller to start game three.[1] 
Miller faced off against Jim Palmer, but lasted only 1⅔ innings, giving 
up five hits and three runs (only one of them earned) before being removed 
by manager Billy Martin.[26][27] Miller's journeyman travels started when 
he was traded by the Twins to the Cleveland Indians on December 10, 1969, 
together with Dean Chance, Graig Nettles and Ted Uhlaender, in exchange 
for Luis Tiant and Stan Williams.[28] He appeared in 15 games for the Indians 
at the start of the 1970, all but two in relief, ending with a 2–2 record 
and one save and an ERA of 4.18.[4] He was traded by the Indians to the 
Chicago White Sox on June 15, 1970 together with Barry Moore with the Indians 
receiving Buddy Bradford and Tommie Sisk.[29] He pitched in 15 games for 
the Indians, all but three as a starter, and ended his time there with 
a 4–6 record and a 5.01 ERA.[4] On September 1, 1970, he was purchased 
by the crosstown Chicago Cubs from the White Sox for an amount described 
by The Washington Post as being well above the $20,000 waivers price.[30] 
In his second game with the Cubs, Miller earned a save against the Mets, 
facing the final five batters in a 7–4 Cubs victory.[31] Miller appeared 
in seven games for the Cubs, ending with no decisions and two saves in 
nine innings of work, and the Cubs fell short in their bid for a playoff 
spot.[4] Miller started the 1971 season with the Cubs, and pitched in two 
games for the team before being released on May 10, 1971.[4] He was signed 
as a free agent the next day by the San Diego Padres. In 38 games with 
the Padres, all in relief, Miller had a 7–3 record and seven saves and 
an ERA of 1.41.[4] The Padres were in last place in the National League 
West with a 42–76 record, 26 1⁄2 games out of first place, and traded Miller 
to the National League East division-leading Pittsburgh Pirates on August 
10, 1971 for Johnny Jeter and Ed Acosta.[32] Miller continued his success 
in the bullpen, ending the season with the Pirates with a 1–2 record and 
three saves in 16 appearances, all in relief, finishing with a 1.29 ERA.[4] 
Miller pitched the second game of the 1971 National League Championship 
Series, entering in the sixth inning and giving up three hits, three walks 
and two runs in three innings of work in a game in which the Pirates held 
on to defeat the San Francisco Giants by a final score of 9–4.[33] He pitched 
in relief in three games in the 1971 World Series against the Baltimore 
Orioles that the Pirates won in seven games, appearing in relief in all 
three Pirate losses (in the first, second and sixth games of the series), 
taking the loss in Game 6 when he gave up a sacrifice fly to Brooks Robinson 
that brought in the winning run.[34][35][36] Miller stuck with the Pirates 
for the entire 1972 season, finishing with a 5–2 record and three saves 
in 36 appearances (all in relief) and an ERA of 2.65.[4] He pitched in 
game four of the 1972 National League Championship Series, appearing in 
the ninth inning of a 7–1 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, retiring all three 
batters he faced in a series that the Pirates lost in five games.[37] Miller 
was released by the Pittsburgh Pirates on March 27, 1973 and signed as 
a free agent with the San Diego Padres on April 2, 1973. In his brief second 
stint with the Padres, he appeared in 18 games, all in relief, had no decisions 
and a 4.11 ERA.[4] He was selected off waivers by the Detroit Tigers from 
the Padres on June 22, 1973. With the Tigers, he had a 4–2 record and one 
save in 22 games (all in relief) and a 3.43 ERA.[4] He was purchased by 
the New York Mets from the Tigers on September 23, 1973, appearing in one 
game for the Mets in their push for the playoffs.[4][38] The Mets made 
it to the 1973 World Series, losing to the Oakland Athletics in seven games, 
but Miller was not placed on the postseason roster, as he had joined the 
team too late in the season.[1] Miller stuck with the Mets for the 1974 
season, ending with a 2–2 record, two saves and a 3.58 ERA in 58 appearances, 
all in relief. His final appearance was on September 28, 1974 in a 7–3 
loss to the Pirates, with Miller getting the last two outs of the fifth 
inning in relief of starter Tug McGraw.[39] He was released by the Mets 
on October 1, 1974.[4] In 1976, Miller was named as manager of the Amarillo 
Gold Sox, the double-A Texas League affiliate of the San Diego Padres. 
He led the team to a first-place finish with an 81–54 record, and won the 
league championship over the Shreveport Captains, a Pittsburgh Pirates 
affiliate, winning the best-of-five series in five games.[1][40] With another 
round of expansion in the major leagues in 1977, Miller was named as the 
pitching coach for the Toronto Blue Jays, where his pitching staff included 
a large number of rookies, and veteran players including former star Bill 
Singer, a two-time 20-game winner, and journeyman Chuck Hartenstein.[5] 
Miller spent three seasons with Toronto, helping to develop future stars 
Dave Stieb and Pete Vuckovich. Five pitchers he coached while with the 
Blue Jays would later become major league pitching coaches, including Joe 
Coleman, Hartenstein, Dyar Miller, Dave Wallace and Mark Wiley.[1] He was 
the pitching coach for the San Francisco Giants in 1985, but after the 
team ended the season with 99 losses, the team fired the entire coaching 
staff, offering Miller a position as pitching coach with the team's top 
minor league affiliates.[41] Miller spent time as a scout, evaluating prospective 
pitchers for the Giants.[42] Miller, then an advance scout for the Giants, 
died of injuries sustained in a collision with another vehicle in Rancho 
Bernardo, California, near San Diego. He was driving with his mother, Norma 
Jean Miller, who was left in serious condition from the accident.[6] Miller, 
who lived in Scottsdale, Arizona, was survived by his wife, Judy, and a
