Oshawa (2011 population 149,607;[4] CMA 356,177)[5] is a city in Ontario, 
Canada, on the Lake Ontario shoreline. It lies in Southern Ontario, approximately 
60 kilometres east of Downtown Toronto. It is commonly viewed as the eastern 
anchor of the Greater Toronto Area and of the Golden Horseshoe. It is the 
largest municipality in the Regional Municipality of Durham. The name Oshawa 
originates from the Ojibwa term aazhaway, meaning "the crossing place" 
or just "(a)cross".[6][7] Oshawa’s roots are tied to the automobile industry, 
specifically the Canadian division of General Motors Company, known as 
General Motors Canada. Founded in 1876 as the McLaughlin Carriage Company, 
General Motors of Canada's headquarters are located in the city. The automotive 
industry was the inspiration for Oshawa's previous mottos: "The City that 
Motovates Canada", and "The City in Motion". The lavish home of the carriage 
company's founder, Parkwood Estate, is a National Historic Site of Canada, 
and a backdrop favoured by numerous film crews, featured in many movies 
including 54, Billy Madison, Chicago, and X-Men.[8] Once recognized as 
the sole "Automotive Capital of Canada",[9] Oshawa today is an education 
and health sciences hub. The city is home to three post-secondary institutions 
(Durham College, Trent University Durham and University of Ontario Institute 
of Technology) and to Lakeridge Health Oshawa, Lakeridge Health and Education 
Research Network (LHEARN Centre) and the Oshawa Clinic, the largest, multi-specialty 
medical group practice in Canada.[10] Key labour force sectors include 
advanced manufacturing, health technology, logistics, energy and IT.[11] 
Downtown Oshawa is identified as an Urban Growth Centre in the Government 
of Ontario's Places to Grow initiative.[12] More than 5,000 people work 
and more than 2,400 university students study in the downtown core. The 
downtown is a prominent centre for entertainment and sporting events (Regent 
Theatre and General Motors Centre), food (50+ restaurants and cafes [13]) 
and culture (The Robert McLaughlin Gallery and Canadian Automotive Museum). 
Oshawa is home to a Regional Innovation Centre[14] and offers start-up 
facilities for entrepreneurs and small businesses. Co-working offices are 
also located in the downtown. Historians believe that the area that would 
become Oshawa began as a transfer point for the fur trade. Beaver and other 
animals trapped for their pelts by local natives were traded with the Coureurs 
des bois (voyagers). Furs were loaded onto canoes by the Mississauga Indians 
at the Oshawa harbour and transported to the trading posts located to the 
west at the mouth of the Credit River. Around 1760, the French constructed 
a trading post near the harbour location; this was abandoned after a few 
years, but its ruins provided shelter for the first residents of what later 
became Oshawa. Most notably, one of the fur traders was Moody Farewell, 
an early resident of the community who was to some extent responsible for 
its name change. In the late 18th century a local resident, Roger Conant, 
started an export business shipping salmon to the United States. His success 
attracted further migration into the region. A large number of the founding 
immigrants were United Empire Loyalists, who left the United States to 
live under British rule. Later Irish and then French Canadian immigration 
increased as did industrialization. Oshawa and the surrounding Ontario 
County were also the settling grounds of a disproportionate number of 19th 
century Cornish immigrants during the Cornish emigration which emptied 
large tracts of that part of England. As well, the surveys ordered by Governor 
John Graves Simcoe, and the subsequent land grants, helped populate the 
area. When Col. Asa Danforth laid out his York-to-Kingston road, it passed 
through what would later become Oshawa. In 1822, a "colonization road" 
(a north-south road to facilitate settlement) known as Simcoe Street was 
constructed. It more or less followed the path of an old native trail known 
as the Nonquon Road, and ran from the harbour to the area of Lake Scugog. 
This intersected the "Kingston Road" at what would become Oshawa's "Four 
Corners." In 1836, Edward Skae relocated his general store approximately 
800 m east to the southeast corner of this intersection; as his store became 
a popular meeting place (probably because it also served as the Post Office), 
the corner and the growing settlement that surrounded it, were known as 
Skae's Corners. In 1842, Skae, the postmaster, applied for official post 
office status, but was informed the community needed a better name. Moody 
Farewell was requested to ask his native acquaintances what they called 
the area; their reply was "Oshawa," which translates to "where we must 
leave our canoes". Thus, the name of Oshawa, one of the primary "motor 
cities" of Canada, has the meaning "where we have to get out and walk". 
The name "Oshawa" was adopted and the post office named accordingly. In 
1849, the requirements for incorporation were eased, and Oshawa was incorporated 
as a village in 1850. The newly established village became an industrial 
centre, and implement works, tanneries, asheries and wagon factories opened 
(and often closed shortly after, as economic "panics" occurred regularly). 
In 1876, Robert Samuel McLaughlin, Sr. moved his carriage works to Oshawa 
from Enniskillen to take advantage of its harbour and of the availability 
of a rail link not too far away. He constructed a two-storey building, 
which was soon added to. This building was heavily remodelled in 1929, 
receiving a new facade and being extended to the north using land where 
the city's gaol (jail, firehall & townhall) had once stood. The village 
became a town in 1879, in what was then called East Whitby Township. Around 
1890, the carriage works relocated from its Simcoe Street address to an 
unused furniture factory a couple of blocks to the northeast, and this 
remained its site until the building burnt in 1899. Offered assistance 
by the town, McLaughlin chose to stay in Oshawa, building a new factory 
across Mary Street from the old site. Rail service had been provided in 
1890 by the Oshawa Railway; this was originally set up as a streetcar line, 
but c. 1910 a second "freight line" was built slightly to the east of Simcoe 
Street.[15] This electric line provided streetcar and freight service, 
connected central Oshawa with the Grand Trunk (now Canadian National) Railway, 
and with the Canadian Northern (which ran through the very north of Oshawa) 
and the Canadian Pacific, built in 1912-13. The Oshawa Railway was acquired 
by the Grand Trunk operation around 1910, and streetcar service was replaced 
by buses in 1940. After GM moved its main plants to south Oshawa in 1951, 
freight traffic fell and most of the tracks were removed in 1963, although 
a line to the older remaining "north" plant via Ritson Road remained until 
2000. In 1907 the McLaughlin Motor Car Company began to manufacture with 
Buick automobiles under the McLaughlin name. This resulted from talks between 
Col. R. S. McLaughlin and "Billy" Durant a 15-year contract in 1907. Durant 
had created General Motors in the U.S. in 1908. In 1915 the firm acquired 
the manufacturing rights to the Chevrolet brand. Within three years, his 
firm and the Chevrolet Motor Car Company of Canada merged, creating General 
Motors of Canada. Col. McLaughlin became the head of this new operation 
in 1918. McLaughlin was Director and Vice-President of General Motors Corporation 
(from GM archives), and his factory expanded rapidly, eventually covering 
several blocks. The popularity of the automobile in the 1920s generated 
rapid expansion of Oshawa, which grew in population from 4,000 to 16,000 
during this decade, and of its land area. In 1924, Oshawa annexed the area 
to its south, including the harbour and the community of Cedardale. This 
growth allowed Oshawa to seek incorporation as a city, which took place 
8 March 1924. With the wealth he gained in his business venture, in 1916 
Robert Samuel McLaughlin built one of the most stately homes in Canada, 
"Parkwood". The 55-room residence was built using inexpensive labour, and 
designed by Toronto architect John M. Lyle. McLaughlin lived in the house 
for 55 years with his wife and five children. The house replaced an older 
mansion, which was about 30 years old when it was demolished; the grounds 
of the earlier home had been operated as Prospect Park, and this land was 
acquired by the town and became its first municipal park, Alexandra Park. 
Parkwood today is open to the public as a National Historic Site. Tours 
are offered. On 8 April 1937, disputes between 4000 assembly line workers 
and General Motors management led to the Oshawa Strike, a salient event 
in the history of Canadian trade unionism. As the weight of the Great Depression 
slowly began to lift, demand for automobiles again began to grow. The workers 
sought higher wages, an eight-hour workday, better working conditions and 
recognition of their union, the United Auto Workers (Local 222). The then-Liberal 
government of Mitchell Hepburn, which had been elected on a platform of 
being the working man's friend, sided with the corporation and brought 
in armed university students to break up any union agitation. These much-derided 
"Hepburn's Hussars" and "Sons of Mitches" were never needed as the union 
refused to be drawn into violent acts. The union and workers had the backing 
of the local population, other unions and the Co-operative Commonwealth 
Federation party, and on 23 April, two weeks after the strike started, 
the company gave in to most of the workers' demands, although — pointedly 
— it did not recognize the union.[16] In 1950, the city annexed a portion 
of East Whitby Township west of Park Road. Some of this area had been developed 
during the 1920s boom period, although it was not within the boundaries 
of the city. The opening of the Oshawa Shopping Centre (now the Oshawa 
Centre) fewer than two kilometres west of the "four corners" in 1956 struck 
a blow to Oshawa's downtown from which it has never been able to recover. 
The shopping centre was built on land which had been an unproductive farm; 
when its owner gave up on agriculture, this released a very large area 
of land for the construction of a mall. The Oshawa Centre is the largest 
shopping mall in Ontario east of Toronto. The opening of what later became 
Highway 401, then known as Highway 2A, shortly after World War II sparked 
increased residential growth in Oshawa and the other lakeshore municipalities 
of Ontario County, which led to the creation of the Regional Municipality 
of Durham in 1974. Oshawa was amalgamated with the remaining portions of 
East Whitby Township and took on its present boundaries, which included 
the outlying villages of Columbus, Raglan and Kedron. Much of Oshawa's 
industry has closed over the years; however, it is still the headquarters 
of GM Canada and its major manufacturing site. Current industries of note 
include manufacturing of railway maintenance equipment, mining equipment, 
steel fabrication, and rubber products. Oshawa is also recognized as an 
official port of entry for immigration and customs services. Oshawa is 
headquarters to General Motors Canada, which has large-scale manufacturing 
and administrative operations in the city and employs many thousands both 
directly and indirectly. Since Windsor, Ontario houses Chrysler Canada 
headquarters, the two cities have something of a friendly rivalry for the 
title of "Automotive Capital of Canada", which is now held by Oshawa.[9] 
While the company’s once essential role in the local economy has diminished, 
it remains the largest local employer. The revenue collection divisions 
of the Ontario Ministry of Finance occupy one of the main office buildings 
in the city's downtown. Oshawa City Hall, General Motors Centre, The Robert 
McLaughlin Gallery are also in the downtown core. The University of Ontario 
Institute of Technology occupies five buildings in downtown. More than 
1,900 U.O.I.T. students and staff attend class and work in downtown Oshawa.[17] 
The city's older southern neighbourhoods tend to be considerably less affluent 
than its more suburban northern sections, which are rapidly expanding as 
Toronto commuters move in. The southern half of the city consists of industrial 
zones and compact housing designed for early 20th century industrial workers, 
while the northern half has a suburban feel more typical of later decades. 
High wages paid to unionized GM employees have meant that these workers 
could enjoy a relatively high standard of living, although such jobs are 
much scarcer today than they once were. During its heyday after World War 
II, General Motors offered some of the best manufacturing jobs available 
in Canada and attracted thousands of workers from economically depressed 
areas of the country, particularly the Maritimes, Newfoundland, rural Quebec 
and northern Ontario. The city was also a magnet for European immigrants 
in the skilled trades, and boasts substantial Polish, Ukrainian, Hungarian, 
Croatian, German, Slovak and Russian ethnic communities. Oshawa has become 
one of the fastest growing cities in Canada, although statements to this 
effect are often in reference to the Census Metropolitan Area, which includes 
neighbouring Whitby and Clarington. Oshawa achieved a record-setting year 
of growth in 2015 with over a half a billion dollars in construction value 
(breaking its previous record in 2014).[18] Many commuters have been enticed 
to Oshawa by comparatively low housing prices and the regular rail service 
into downtown Toronto provided by GO Transit and Via Rail. The growth of 
subdivisions to house Toronto commuters will likely accelerate with the 
Highway 407 East extension. Highway 407 East (407E) opened to Harmony Road 
in Oshawa on June 20, 2016, including a tolled north–south link to Highway 
401 known as Highway 412. A further extension will push the highway east 
to Highway 35 / Highway 115 in Clarington by 2020, with a second link to 
Highway 401 known as Highway 418. In spring 2016, Oshawa was ranked No. 
1 city for jobs in Canada when compared to 33 cities across the country.[19] 
The trend suggests major social and demographic changes for Oshawa, which 
has long had a vigorous labour union presence, a mostly white demographic, 
and a largely blue collar identity. Similar to all of southern Ontario, 
Oshawa has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) 
with vast, but not extreme, seasonal temperature differences. The dominant 
presence of General Motors (and its autoworkers) meant that Oshawa was 
well known as a bastion of unionist, left-wing support during the decades 
following the Second World War. The city played an important role in Canada's 
labour history, including the 1937 "Oshawa Strike" against General Motors 
and the considerable financial support provided by the city's autoworkers 
to the New Democratic Party (NDP) and its predecessors. However, Oshawa 
was part of the Ontario (County) riding when Michael Starr served; Starr 
was a high ranking Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) and 
Cabinet Member during the Diefenbaker era. Starr served the new Oshawa—Whitby 
riding for one term, before being narrowly defeated by future federal NDP 
leader Ed Broadbent in 1968. Broadbent then represented the city in the 
House of Commons until 1989, and in the 1980s led the NDP to its greatest 
electoral successes. By the end of the 1990s, the city's changing economy 
and demographics led many voters to the Progressive Conservative Party 
of Ontario and the Canadian Alliance, a conservative party at the federal 
level. Conservative candidates have won recent provincial and federal elections, 
whereas from 1968-93 the city was a safe NDP seat in both the federal and 
provincial legislatures. The city's shifting social and political dynamics 
were seen in the 2004 federal election - the riding of Oshawa (not coterminous 
with the City of Oshawa, but containing most of it) was the country's most 
competitive. The candidate of the new Conservative Party of Canada, Colin 
Carrie, edged out his NDP rival Sid Ryan by several hundred votes; it was 
an atypical and ideologically stark race that left Louise Parkes of the 
Liberals in third place. In 2006, Whitby—Oshawa also became a Conservative 
seat; Jim Flaherty followed Starr (after over 40 years) into the Cabinet 
of Canada as Minister of Finance. In 2014, Jennifer French of the Ontario 
New Democratic Party was elected as Member of Provincial Parliament in 
the provincial riding of Oshawa with over 40% of the vote. The council 
of the City of Oshawa is made up of eleven members - one mayor, seven regional 
councillors and three city councillors. The mayor is elected at large by 
electors throughout the city, heads the council of the City of Oshawa and 
is also a representative of the city on the council of the Regional Municipality 
of Durham. Seven regional councillors are elected at large by electors 
throughout the city to represent the city on both the council of the City 
of Oshawa and the council of the Regional Municipality of Durham. Three 
city councillors are elected at large by electors throughout the city to 
represent the city on the council of the City of Oshawa. There are four 
standing committees of council: Finance Committee, Development Services 
Committee, Community Services Committee, and the Corporate Services Committee. 
Public education in Oshawa is provided by the Durham District School Board. 
As of June 2015, there were 28 elementary schools and six secondary schools.[21] 
The Durham Catholic District School Board, which has its headquarters in 
Oshawa, oversees public Catholic education in Durham Region. There are 
10 Catholic elementary schools and two secondary schools. The Conseil scolaire 
Viamonde operates one French public elementary school, while the Conseil 
scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud runs one publicly funded French-language 
Catholic elementary school. Private schools include Durham Elementary School, 
Immanuel Christian School, Kingsway College and College Park Elementary 
School. Oshawa is home to 22,000 full-time students studying at three post-secondary 
institutions – Durham College, Trent University Durham and University of 
Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT). Oshawa is a Community Teaching 
Site for Queen’s University School of Medicine at Lakeridge Health. The 
main campus of Durham College is located in the city. The college has grown 
and expanded since it opened in 1967 and now offers more than 140 full-time 
programs. The University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) opened 
in 2003. Given the city's industrial heritage, the university's courses 
emphasize technology, manufacturing and engineering themes. UOIT has ten 
buildings at two stand-alone campus locations (north Oshawa and Downtown 
Oshawa) and houses more than 70 specialized research laboratories and research 
facilities. It is the only university in Canada to offer degree programs 
in Automotive Engineering and Nuclear Engineering.[citation needed] Trent 
University Durham has a long history in Oshawa. In 2010, the university 
opened a stand-alone campus in Oshawa (beside the Oshawa Civic Recreation 
Complex). Oshawa is the site of Lakeridge Health Oshawa, formerly Oshawa 
General Hospital. Lakeridge Health is one of Ontario's largest community 
hospitals. The facility also houses the R.S. McLaughlin Durham Regional 
Cancer Centre. Lakeridge Health Oshawa is also home to Lakeridge Health 
Education and Research Network (LHEARN) that opened in 2013. LHEARN is 
the academic home for Queen’s University family physician residency program 
and for pediatric residency and training. LHEARN Centre provides training 
and testing medical professionals, including doctors, nurses and first 
responders (including Ornge critical care air ambulance paramedics).[22] 
Policing in Oshawa is provided by the Durham Regional Police Service. There 
are two police stations in Oshawa — one at 77 Centre Street North in the 
downtown area, and a South Oshawa Community Policing Centre on Cedar Street. 
EMS/Ambulance services are also operated by the Region of Durham. Oshawa 
Fire Services - operated by the city - operates from five fire stations 
located throughout the city. A sixth fire station is under construction 
at the northeast corner of Simcoe Street North and Britannia Avenue East.[23] 
Oshawa was the first city in Ontario to provide paramedic services. In 
1979, 16 ambulance attendants were given specialized training to treat 
cardiac related problems in the pre-hospital setting. The program was called 
the Pre-hospital Cardiac Care (PHCC) program. From this single service, 
paramedic training was expanded to Toronto, Hamilton and the Provincial 
air ambulance service. The program has been the source of all paramedic 
programs in Ontario. Oshawa has few media outlets of its own due to its 
proximity to Toronto. The city has one AM station, CKDO (1580), which is 
rebroadcast on 107.7 FM, and one FM station, 94.9 CKGE. Both stations are 
owned by Durham Radio, which also owns CJKX, which is licensed to the nearby 
community of Ajax, although all three stations are operated from the same 
studios at the Oshawa Executive Airport. Oshawa has a CTV affiliate station, 
CHEX-TV-2 (Channel 12), which is a sister station of Peterborough's CHEX-DT. 
It airs a daily supper hour news and current affairs program targeted to 
Durham Region viewers. Although a larger city than Peterborough then and 
now, Oshawa was not granted a television station in the original 1950s 
assignments as it was geographically too close to Toronto, since the original 
spacings were set at 145 km (90 mi). Rogers Cable, the local cable television 
service provider, operates Rogers TV: a community channel with local television 
programming for cable subscribers. Oshawa is served by several community 
newspapers, including the Oshawa Express, an independent which is published 
every Wednesday, and Oshawa This Week, published two times per week by 
Metroland. The long-standing daily newspaper, the Oshawa Times (also known 
at various times as the Oshawa Daily Times and Times-Gazette), was closed 
by its owner Thomson Newspapers, after a lengthy strike in 1994. John Short 
Larke was the proprietor of the Oshawa Vindicator, a strongly pro-Conservative 
newspaper, in the late 19th century.[24] Oshawa is home to Artsforum Magazine, 
a not-for-profit magazine of arts and ideas launched in Fall 2000 by John 
Arkelian, its publisher and editor-in-chief. With a wide-ranging writ that 
runs the gamut from foreign policy to film, Artsforum's readership extends 
far beyond its home in the Greater Toronto Area, with readers and contributors 
across Canada, the United States, and Western Europe.[citation needed][25] 
Oshawa is home to the Oshawa Generals of the Ontario Hockey League, the 
top level for players aged 15–20. In 2015, the Oshawa Generals won the 
Ontario Hockey League Championship, and ended their season winning the 
Memorial Cup Championship. Famous alumni of this team include Bobby Orr, 
Alex Delvecchio, Wayne Cashman, Tony Tanti, Dave Andreychuk, Marc Savard, 
Eric Lindros, and John Tavares. The team moved from the Oshawa Civic Auditorium 
into the new General Motors Centre in November 2006. The Oshawa Generals' 
home arena has been destroyed by fire twice in the franchise history. In 
June 1928, the Bradley Arena was destroyed by fire. Then, 25 years later, 
the Hambly Arena was also destroyed by fire. Oshawa hosted Ron MacLean 
and the Rogers Hometown Hockey Tour on December 26–27, 2015.[26] The Oshawa 
Power of the National Basketball League of Canada began playing in October 
2011. In the Spring of 2013, the Power announced a move from Oshawa to 
Mississauga, a western suburb of Toronto. The Power played home games at 
the General Motors Centre. Oshawa was for many years one of the main centres 
for the sport of lacrosse and home of the Oshawa Green Gaels, one of the 
most storied teams in the sport. A player of note in the 1920s was Nels 
Stewart, who became a Hall of Famer in the National Hockey League. During 
the 1980s, when lacrosse seemed on the edge of oblivion in Canada, (the 
Green Gaels themselves having folded in the early part of the decade), 
lacrosse continued to be played in the neighbouring towns of Whitby and 
Brooklin, and many of the players were from Oshawa. However, since then, 
Clarington has taken over the Green Gaels association. With the rise of 
the National Lacrosse League the sport's survival seems assured and again, 
many players and others involved in the professional league are from the 
Oshawa area. Former Oshawa Green Gaels captain and Oshawa native, Derek 
Keenan, is the current coach and general manager of the Edmonton Rush. 
He was inducted into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 2012. Oshawa 
has been the home of Oshawa Vikings Rugby Football Club since 1959. Notable 
players from the club since its inception include Dave Thompson (Ontario 
Rugby Hall of Fame), Dean Van Camp (Rugby Canada Men XV squad, OUA All-Star), 
Jonathan Cregg (Canada Rugby League Men's Squad, OUA All-Star), Jeffrey 
McDiarmid (Rugby Canada Under 19, OUA All-Star) and Andrew Tyler (Western 
University Men's Varsity Rugby MVP, OUA All-Star). The clubhouse (Thompson 
Rugby Park)[27] is located in the Oshawa Hamlet of Raglan. With over 3000 
members the Oshawa Kicks Soccer Club[28] is the largest soccer club in 
the City. The club offers recreational programs for 2000 children, and 
adult men's and women's leagues. In 2011 the Kicks were the first soccer 
club to operate children's and adult's winter soccer leagues in the new 
Civic Fieldhouse. The club has a competitive program for youth and adults, 
and has won several Ontario Cup Championship titles. In 2014 the Oshawa 
Kicks Soccer Club and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club [29] signed an 
affiliation agreement that opened a pathway to professional soccer for 
boys and girls. Oshawa was home to Windfields Farm, a thoroughbred horse 
breeding operation and birthplace of one of Canada's most famous racehorses, 
Northern Dancer.[citation needed] Oshawa hosted boxing and weightlifting 
events for the 2015 Pan American Games which were held in the Greater Toronto 
Area. GO Transit trains connect the city with Toronto, Hamilton and points 
between. GO Transit buses provide service from Oshawa along the Highway 
401 and Highway 2 corridors in Durham Region and to Toronto and York Region. 
GO Transit bus service is also provided from Oshawa Train station to Clarington 
and Peterborough via the downtown bus terminal. The Oshawa Station is owned 
by the national rail carrier Via Rail, which operates a service along the 
Quebec City–Windsor Corridor. Other services from the station include GO 
Buses, and the regional transit system Durham Region Transit provides local 
bus service. It replaced Oshawa Transit on 1 January 2006. The province 
announced in June 2016 an extension of the GO train service from Oshawa 
to Bowmanville, including extending the train network by nearly 20 kilometres 
and building four new stations.[30] The new GO rail service is expected 
to begin by 2023-24. The four new stations will be at Thornton Road in 
Oshawa, Ritson Road in Oshawa, Courtice Road in Courtice and Martin Road 
in Bowmanville. Private intercity buses are provided by Greyhound Canada 
(to Toronto, Port Hope, Cobourg and Belleville, and to Peterborough and 
Ottawa, and Can-Ar daily to/from Lindsay and Toronto. Rail freight is carried 
on the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railways which traverse the 
city. Other than Highway 2, which reverted to local jurisdiction (King 
Street and Bond Street) in 1998, the city had no provincially maintained 
highways until the original section of Highway 401 opened in 1947 (as Highway 
2A). The highway originally terminated at Ritson Road, and was extended 
east through the remainder of the city to Newcastle in 1952. Oshawa was 
the only city that Highway 401 was built directly through, rather than 
bypassing. This resulted in the demolition of several streets and hundreds 
of homes in the 1930s and 1940s. Highway 407, a tolled 400-series highway, 
opened to Harmony Road in Oshawa on June 20, 2016, including a tolled north–south 
link to Highway 401 known as Highway 412. A further extension will push 
the highway further east to Highway 35 / Highway 115 in Clarington by 2020, 
with a second link to Highway 401 known as Highway 418. The Port of Oshawa 
is a major stop for the auto and steel industries as well as winter road 
salt handling and agricultural fertilizer. A marine rescue unit (COMRA) 
is also stationed at the port. A regional airport with on-site customs 
and immigration authorities also services the City (see above). On 21 May 
2009, Canadian Transportation Minister John Baird announced that the status 
of Oshawa's port would be changed from a harbour commission to a full-fledged 
Port Authority. The creation of a federal port authority has caused some 
controversy as there are others who wish to see the port transferred to 
municipal ownership and recreational use. The closest international airport 
is Toronto Pearson International Airport, located 75 kilometres west by 
road in Mississauga. According to the 2011 census, the population of Oshawa 
is 149,607, up from 141,590 (5.7%) in the 2006 census. In 2001, 49.3% of 
the population was male and 50.7% female. Children under five accounted 
for approximately 6.5% of the resident population of Oshawa. This compares 
with 5.8% in Ontario, and almost 5.6% for Canada overall. In mid-2001, 
10.4% of the resident population in Oshawa were of retirement age (65 and 
over for males and females) compared with 13.2% in Canada, therefore, the 
average age is 35.8 years of age comparing to 37.6 years of age for all 
of Canada. In the five years between 1996 and 2001, the population of Oshawa 
grew by 10.2%, compared with an increase of 6.1% for Ontario as a whole. 
Population density of Oshawa averaged 328.0 people per square kilometre, 
compared with an average of 12.6, for Ontario altogether. According to 
the 2006 census, the Oshawa Census Metropolitan Area, which includes neighbouring 
Whitby and Clarington, has a population of 330,594. The information regarding 
ethnicities at the left is from the Canadian Census.[32] The percentages 
add to more than 100% because of dual responses (e.g. "French-Canadian"
