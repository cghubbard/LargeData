Octavio Eduardo Dotel Diaz (born November 25, 1973) is a Dominican former 
professional baseball pitcher. Dotel played for thirteen major league teams, 
more than any other player in the history of Major League Baseball (MLB), 
setting the mark when he pitched for the Detroit Tigers on April 7, 2012, 
breaking a record previously held by Mike Morgan, Matt Stairs, and Ron 
Villone.[1] He was a member of the Houston Astros for 5 seasons. Dotel 
made his MLB debut on June 26, 1999, for the New York Mets and lost. His 
first MLB win came July 1, 1999, against the Florida Marlins.[2] He ended 
the season as the winning pitcher in the 1999 National League Championship 
Series game five against the Atlanta Braves. He was voted Player of the 
Week for the week of July 25, 1999.[3] Dotel won the 2011 World Series 
as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals. In 2013, as part of the World Baseball 
Classic champions along with fellow Dominicans Robinson Canó and Santiago 
Casilla, Dotel became one of the few players in history to win both a World 
Series and a World Baseball Classic. (Daisuke Matsuzaka and Koji Uehara 
have as well.) Dotel graduated from Liceo Cansino Afuera in the Dominican 
Republic and was signed by the New York Mets as an amateur free agent in 
1993. He played for their minor league affiliate in the Dominican Summer 
League through 1994 and then promoted through the Mets' minor league system 
for the next several seasons. On December 23, 1999, Dotel was traded by 
the Mets with Roger Cedeño and minor leaguer Kyle Kessel to the Houston 
Astros for Mike Hampton and Derek Bell. In 2000 Dotel amassed three wins 
in 16 games started as well as 16 saves as his role converted from starter 
to relief pitcher for the Astros, filling in as closer for an injured Billy 
Wagner. This season marked the first time in National League history that 
a pitcher had over 15 starts and 15 saves[citation needed] (the only other 
season in MLB history came in the American League in 1999, when Tim Wakefield 
won six games in 17 starts and attained 15 saves for the Boston Red Sox). 
In 2001, Dotel again began the season as a starter but moved into the bullpen 
as the setup man for closer Billy Wagner. Dotel had an excellent season 
in 2002; he led all relievers with 118 strikeouts, helping secure a well-reputed 
bullpen for the Astros at that time. By 2003, Dotel and Wagner were joined 
by future Astros closer Brad Lidge and all three partook in a historic 
event when six Astros pitchers combined for a no-hitter against the New 
York Yankees on June 11, 2003.[4][5] After the 2003 season, Wagner was 
traded to the Philadelphia Phillies and Dotel started 2004 as the closer 
for the Astros. On June 24, 2004, Dotel was traded to the Oakland Athletics 
in a three-team trade that sent Carlos Beltrán to the Astros, minor leaguer 
Mike Wood, Mark Teahen, and John Buck to the Kansas City Royals. Dotel 
served as closer for the Athletics and finished the 2004 season with a 
career-high 36 saves (22 for the A's and 14 for the Astros).[citation needed] 
Dotel began 2005 as closer for the Athletics again, but had a rough start 
and went on the 60-day disabled list on 19 May. He underwent Tommy John 
surgery on June 1, ending his season after just 15 games.[6] Dotel signed 
a one-year deal with the New York Yankees in December 2005. He missed the 
first four months of the 2006 season, recovering from his Tommy John surgery. 
Dotel had a setback after developing tendinitis in his elbow while on a 
rehab assignment with the Trenton Thunder. This pushed his return into 
August as he went through another minor league assignment with the Columbus 
Clippers. Dotel pitched his first game in a Yankees uniform on August 16, 
coming into the game in the eighth inning against the Baltimore Orioles, 
facing two batters with one strikeout and one walk. He finished the season 
playing in 14 games with no record and an ERA of 10.80. Dotel became a 
free agent at the end of the 2006 MLB season. On December 8, 2006, he agreed 
to a one-year contract with the Kansas City Royals for $5 million.[7] On 
July 31, 2007 the Royals traded Dotel to the Atlanta Braves in exchange 
for pitcher Kyle Davies. He made his Braves debut on August 1, throwing 
a scoreless ninth inning in a 12–3 rout of the Astros. On August 10, Dotel 
was placed on the disabled list with a right shoulder strain. He made his 
return on September 22 escaping a bases-loaded jam which eventually led 
to a Braves win. He finished the season 2–1 with a 3.76 ERA. On January 
21, 2008 he agreed to a two-year, $11 million deal with the Chicago White 
Sox.[7] On January 21, 2010, Dotel agreed to a one-year, $3.25 million 
deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates, plus bonuses for games finished. The 
deal also included a club option for 2011 for $4.5 million with a $250,000 
buyout. Dotel started the year as the Pirates closer and stayed the closer 
until he was traded. Dotel recorded 21 saves in 2010 with the Pirates.[8][9] 
On July 31, 2010, Dotel was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for James 
McDonald and Andrew Lambo.[10] He appeared in 19 games with the Dodgers 
and had a 3.38 ERA and one save. On September 18, 2010, Dotel was traded 
to the Colorado Rockies for a player to be named later. Dotel was ineligible 
to play on the postseason roster, but it made no difference as Colorado 
missed the playoffs. Dotel finished playing in eight games with the Rockies, 
going 0–1 with a 5.06 ERA.[11] Dotel agreed to a one-year, $3.5 million 
deal with the Toronto Blue Jays with a club option for 2012.[12] He earned 
his 50th career victory on April 8, 2011 against the Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim. On July 27, 2011, Dotel was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals 
with Edwin Jackson, Marc Rzepczynski and Corey Patterson for Colby Rasmus, 
P. J. Walters, Trever Miller and Brian Tallet.[13][14] Dotel got his first 
championship title when the Cardinals beat the Texas Rangers in the 2011 
World Series. On October 31, 2011 it was announced that Cardinals would 
not pick up his team option for the 2012 season, making Dotel a type A 
free agent. Dotel signed with the Detroit Tigers on December 7, 2011. He 
made his debut for them on April 7, 2012. The Tigers were Dotel's thirteenth 
major league team, allowing him to pass Matt Stairs, Mike Morgan and Ron 
Villone for the MLB record of the most teams for which a player played.[15] 
I've been all over the place. I've been in every league. Every division, 
too: West, Central, East. National League – boom, boom, boom. American 
League – boom, boom, boom. Dotel made his 700th appearance in a major-league 
game on April 21, 2012, in the nightcap of a double-header against the 
Texas Rangers.[16] Dotel entered the World Series for the second year in 
a row but lost to the San Francisco Giants in a 4-game sweep. On June 8, 
2013, Dotel was placed on the 60-day DL due to right elbow inflammation. 
On October 3, 2014, Dotel announced his retirement from professional baseball 
at the age of 40 after pitching 15 seasons for 13 MLB teams. His career 
strikeout rate of 10.8 per nine innings is the best in the history of baseball 
for right-handed pitchers with at least 900 innings pitched.[17] Dotel 
mainly threw a four-seam fastball from 90–93 mph. He had two breaking balls, 
mostly used in 2-strike counts: a sweeping slider in the low 80s and a 
curveball in the upper 70s. The slider was used against right-handed hitters, 
the curveball against left-handers.[18] He was a strikeout pitcher throughout 
his career, finishing above 10 strikeouts per 9 innings in 10 full seasons.[19] 
In November 1993, not long after Dotel received his first contract with 
the New York Mets, his father was murdered. Emilio Dotel, 53, entered a 
taxi cab on his way home from work and was robbed, strangled, and killed. 
His body was found a day later 5 miles (8.0 km) from his house in Santo 
Domingo, Dominican Republic. The late Emilio Dotel and his wife, Maria 
Magdalena Dotel, had three sons and two daughters.[20] Octavio Dotel is 
married to Massiel.[21] While playing for the St. Louis Cardinals, Dotel
