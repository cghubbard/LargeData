Herrin is a city in Williamson County, Illinois, United States. The population 
was 12,501 at the 2010 census. It is home to country music star David Lee 
Murphy, the hometown of baseball's Ray Chapman, and the hometown of San 
Diego State University men's basketball coach Steve Fisher, as well as 
Medal of Honor recipient Joseph William Ozbourn. The city is part of the 
Marion-Herrin Micropolitan Area and is a part of the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, 
Illinois Combined Statistical Area with 123,272 residents, the sixth most 
populous Combined statistical area in Illinois. The city is also part of 
the Metro Lakeland area. Herrin is located at 37°48′9″N 89°1′41″W﻿ / ﻿37.80250°N 
89.02806°W﻿ / 37.80250; -89.02806 (37.802412, -89.028093).[1] According 
to the 2010 census, Herrin has a total area of 9.461 square miles (24.50 km2), 
of which 9.23 square miles (23.91 km2) (or 97.56%) is land and 0.231 square 
miles (0.60 km2) (or 2.44%) is water.[2] Herrin is just south of Chittyville, 
which has occasioned many puns among the local population. The settlement 
of Herrin started out as scattered settlers on Herring's Prairie named 
for the first permanent settler Isaac Herring, a Baptist preacher. Later, 
his son-in-law David Herrin arrived and the similarity in names led to 
the eventual shortening of the name to just Herrin's Prairie. The trails 
from Jordan's fort to Humphreys' ford on the Big Muddy River intersected 
the old trail from Lusk's ferry at modern-day Golconda to Kaskaskia.[3] 
Isaac Herring entered the first land in what became Herrin on 4 November 
1816, two years before Illinois became a state. He paid $2 an acre for 
the 160 acres (65 ha). At the time he lived to the west in Jackson County, 
the land entry was the northeast quarter off Section 30, Township 8 South, 
Range 2 East of the Third Principal Meridian.[4] Today that area runs between 
17th and 27th Streets, and from West Cherry Street on the north to West 
Stotlar Street on the south.[5] David Ruffin Harrison started storekeeping 
on the prairie in 1858. During the Civil War, he built a frame store building 
and secured a fourth class post office that opened on 26 May 1864. After 
coal was discovered and mining began in nearby Carterville, Harrison, and 
his cousins Ephraim Snyder Herrin and Mrs. Williams in 1892 prospected 
for coal beginning at the southwest corner of Williams' farm, identified 
in 1939 as the corner of Legion Boulevard and East Herrin St. (Legion Blvd 
no longer appears on the maps, but the reference indicates the intersection 
was the North and North East public roads. The 1908 county atlas shows 
North East Public Road two blocks east of Park Avenue which would make 
it North 13th Street). "The men put up the cash, Mrs. Williams boarded 
the workers. A fine vein of coal was found at 185 feet." In 1895, the Chicago 
and Carbondale Railroad organized the purpose of laying tracks between 
the Illinois Central railroad at Carbondale with the new Chicago, Paducah 
and Memphis Railroad that had opened up in 1894 going through the central 
part of the county. (This one later became the Chicago and Eastern Illinois 
railroad). Herrin convinced the developers to take their line between Carbondale 
and Johnston City through Herrin. Soon after it opened, the line was sold 
to the Chicago and Texas railroad in the fall of 1895. The following spring 
on 8 May 1896, the post office changed to Herrin post office and cousins 
Harrison and Herrin, great-grandsons of Isaac Herring made plans for a 
new town. They platted a 40-acre site divided by the line between Sections 
19 and 30 of the township. They filed the plat 4 December 1896. The community 
incorporated as a village on 21 March 1898, and as a city two years later 
on 17 April 1900.[6][7] Herrin was the site of the 1922 Herrin massacre, 
during which two union miners and 19 strike-breakers were killed. Herrin 
also had a recreational park, White City Park. It had a salt water swimming 
pool, rides and a theater. It also had the big bands play at the time. 
The Dorsey Brothers and Frank Sinatra played bocce ball and performed there. 
White City Park opened on Memorial Day 1924 with 5000 in attendance. President 
Harry S Truman came to Herrin in September 1948. Three future presidents 
came to Herrin: Richard Nixon, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Gerald 
Ford came to the Herrin-Marion airport in the 1970s. At one time Herrin 
had 10 hotels, many clothing stores, grocery stores as well as department 
stores. Of the grocery stores Herrin has had over the years, only Louie's 
P&R is still open. As of the census[10] of 2000, there were 11,298 people,
