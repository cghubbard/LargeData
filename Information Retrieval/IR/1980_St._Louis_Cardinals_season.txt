The St. Louis Cardinals 1980 season was the team's 99th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and the 89th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
74-88 during the season and finished fourth in the National League East, 
17 games behind the eventual NL pennant and World Series champion Philadelphia 
Phillies. The Cardinals played the season under four different managers, 
Ken Boyer (fired June 8 between games of a double-header against the Expos 
in Montreal), Jack Krol (the second game of the double-header that same 
day), Whitey Herzog (June 9 until he was hired as the team's general manager 
in late August, succeeding John Claiborne, who was fired earlier in August) 
and Red Schoendienst (from late August to end of season). After the season, 
Herzog reclaimed the managerial job. This team set a record for the most 
Silver Slugger Award winners in one season: Keith Hernández (first base), 
Garry Templeton (shortstop), George Hendrick (outfielder), Ted Simmons 
(catcher), and Bob Forsch (pitcher).[1] Hernández also won a Gold Glove.
