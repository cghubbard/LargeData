Pottsville is a city in, and the county seat of, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, 
United States.[1] The population was 14,324 at the 2010 census, and is 
the principal city of the Pottsville, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area. 
The city lies along the west bank of the Schuylkill River, 52 miles (84 km) 
south of Wilkes Barre. It is located in Pennsylvania's Coal Region. Charles 
II granted the land that eventually became Pottsville to William Penn. 
The grant comprised all lands west and south of the Delaware and the Schuylkill; 
the site of Pottsville was originally in Chester County. When the legislative 
Council, on May 10, 1729, enacted the law erecting Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, 
which included all the lands of the Province lying westward of a straight 
line drawn northeasterly from the headwaters of Octorara Creek (near the 
southern borders) marked with blazed trees, to the Schuylkill River, then 
this placed Pottsville in Lancaster County. By enactment of the same Council, 
approved on March 11, 1752, Berks County was erected; this placed Pottsville 
within the limits of that county. Pottsville's anthracite coal history 
began in 1790 when a coal seam was discovered by hunter Necho Allen. Legend 
has it that Allen fell asleep at the base of the Broad Mountain and woke 
to the sight of a large fire; his campfire had ignited an outcropping of 
coal. By 1795 an anthracite-fired finery forge was established on the Schuylkill 
River.[citation needed] In 1806 John Pott[2] purchased the forge. By an 
act of Assembly of the Commonwealth approved March 1, 1811, the County 
of Schuylkill was erected out of portions of Berks and Northampton; this 
placed the site of Pottsville in Schuylkill County. The town was formally 
laid out in 1816 by a local surveyor, Henry Donnell. Pottsville was established 
as a village in Norwegian Township in 1819 and incorporated as a borough 
on February 19, 1828. In 1829, D.G. Yuengling & Son established what is 
now the oldest operated family beer brewery in the United States. In 1851 
Pottsville became the county seat, the original county seat being Orwigsburg.[3] 
The Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company, which has its roots 
in the Philadelphia and Reading Railway Company, the remnants of which 
were acquired in the late 20th century by the Reading Anthracite Company, 
acquired extentive coal lands and would become one of the most notable 
of the coal companies operating in Pennsylvania until the demise of the 
anthracite industry after World War II. Because of its location along the 
Schuylkill River, Pottsville developed a small textile industry. Out of 
this industry grew the Phillips Van Heusen company which was founded in 
1881. Moses Phillips and his wife Endel began sewing shirts by hand and 
selling them from pushcarts to the local coal miners. Van Heusen and other 
textile companies left the region starting in the late 1970s, mainly as 
a result of foreign competition. Another element of the textile industry 
was the Tilt Silk Mill on Twelfth Street, which produced silk from silk 
worms imported from China which fed on mulberry trees in the building's 
solarium. The silk business eventually was eclipsed by the development 
of nylon stockings. The building still stands and is presently the headquarters 
of a storage and vehicle rental business. During the Prohibition period 
in the United States, under the 18th Amendment, Yuengling stopped making 
beer and moved to production of "near beer". The three brews produced in 
this time were the Yuengling Special (the most popular brand), Yuengling 
Por-Tor (a version of their "celebrated Pottsville Porter"), and finally, 
the Yuengling Juvo, which was a cereal beverage. Then-owner Frank Yuengling 
also opened the Yuengling Dairy, which produced ice cream and other dairy 
products for the local area. These ventures helped to keep the company 
afloat during that period. When the 18th Amendment was repealed, Yuengling 
stopped production of "near beer" and resumed making alcoholic beverages. 
The brewery famously sent a truckload of its Winner Beer to the White House 
in 1933 as thanks to President Franklin D. Roosevelt for the repeal of 
Prohibition. Yuengling still continues its family-owned business today. 
It is the second largest American-owned brewery, after the Boston Beer 
Company, producer of Samuel Adams beer. The Yuengling Dairy was operated 
by a different branch of the family from the Brewery. Business declined 
and the dairy folded as of 1985. Attempted buyouts by large conglomerate 
breweries have all been unsuccessful. Pottsville was chartered as a third-class 
city on March 22, 1911. Pottsville was host to a National Football League 
franchise from 1925-1928. The Pottsville Maroons played in Sportsman's 
Park (or Minersville Park) in nearby Minersville, now the site of King's 
Village shopping plaza. The Maroons posted some of the best records in 
the NFL during the 1925 and 1926 seasons. The Maroons had a claim to the 
1925 NFL championship, but because of a controversial decision by NFL President 
Joe Carr, the title was instead awarded to the Chicago Cardinals. The Maroons 
suffered two more losing seasons before relocating to Boston and becoming 
the Boston Bulldogs. The Bulldogs folded in 1929. Until the middle of the 
20th century, Pottsville was a popular destination for many traveling acts 
and vaudeville performers. The 1929 film Berth Marks stars the comedy legends 
Laurel and Hardy as they attempt to reach Pottsville by train for one of 
their booked performances. Pearl Bailey had once resided in Pottsville 
during the early part of her entertaining career.[citation needed] Soldiers 
in training at nearby Fort Indiantown Gap were prohibited from visiting 
Pottsville during most of World War II due to the large amounts of illicit 
venues and activities present during the time.[citation needed] The city 
completed in 2007 a streetscaping project on Centre Street. In June 2011, 
the City of Pottsville became the county's transportation hub for STS (Schuylkill 
Transportation System) bus service throughout the county with the $16.1 
million Union Station Intermodal Transit Center at 300 S. Centre Street.[5] 
It also accommodates Trailways and Greyhound bus services. The Pottsville 
Downtown Historic District, Cloud Home, John O'Hara House, Burd Patterson 
House, Pottsville Armory, D.G. Yuengling and Son Brewing Complex, and Frank 
D. Yuengling Mansion are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[6] 
Pottsville is located at 40°41′06″N 76°12′10″W﻿ / ﻿40.685058°N 76.202747°W﻿

States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 4.20 square miles (10.9 km2).It 
is all land; none of the area is covered in water. Although there are no 
lakes within the city there are several water courses which flow through 
the city. The Schuylkill River flows through the extreme southern part 
of the city near Mount Carbon. The West Branch of the Schuylkill River 
makes up the western border for the city. Within the city itself the West 
Branch of Norwegian Creek flows through the Fishbach section of the city 
and the East Branch of Norwegian Creek flows through the Jalappa section 
of the city. Joining together near Progress Avenue and Terry Reiley Way 
they form Norwegian Creek which flows underground through the heart of 
the city. The creek empties into the Schuylkill River at Mauch Chunk Street. 
Pottsville sits on seven hills: Lawton's Hill, Greenwood Hill, Bunker Hill 
(Sharp Mountain), Guinea Hill, Forest Hills, Cottage Hill and Mount Hope. 
The Pottsville Formation is named after the town; it is a geologic complex 
including coal, sandstone, and coarse conglomerate that runs along the 
Appalachian Mountains from Alabama to New York. Its type section is on 
a cut for the Pennsylvania Railroad through Sharp Mountain south of the 
city.[8] Pottsville experiences a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) according 
to the Köppen climate classification system, or a humid continental climate

interest, including: Pottsville fielded a team in the National Football 
League between 1925 and 1929 called the Pottsville Maroons. Pottsville 
also has two leagues associated with Little League Baseball: Pottsville 
(Rotary) Little League, and Railway Park Little League. Railway Park was 
the U.S. Eastern Regional representative in the 1997 Little League World 
Series. The Pottsville Crimson Tide football team is one of the oldest 
prep football programs in the country[citation needed] . At the end of 
the 2007 football season, Pottsville had played 1137 games, which tied 
them for first in the nation among prep games played.[citation needed] 
Pottsville once hosted a home game for the New York Giants.[citation needed] 
Pottsville's Fire Department is mostly volunteer. The only non-volunteer 
positions are the fire chief and four assistant chiefs. The following is 
a list of fire companies in the city. The Republican & Herald is the only 
local daily newspaper serving Pottsville. There are also three radio stations 
broadcasting from Pottsville. The area is also served by local television 
stations from the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area. They include WNEP-TV 16 (ABC), 
WYOU-TV 22 (CBS), WBRE-TV 28 (NBC), WVIA-TV 44 (PBS) and WOLF-TV 56 (FOX). 
Dial telephone service came to Pottsville on August 30, 1956 with Mayor 
George Heffner making the first call on the new MArket 2 exchange, which 
still exists. Since then five exchanges have been added to serve the city. 
Pottsville is served by a small general aviation airport, Schuylkill County 
Airport (ZER). Since 2011 Intercity public bus service has been provided 
at the Union Station Intermodal Transportation Center at 300 South Centre 
Street. Mass transit for the greater Pottsville area is provided by Schuylkill 
Transportation System, which operates inter-city bus services throughout 
the county. The Intermodal Center also accommodates Greyhound and Trailways. 
Two major highways converge on Pottsville, PA Route 61 and U.S. Route 209. 
Passenger train service between Pottsville, Reading and Philadelphia[14] 
was operated by Conrail under the auspices of SEPTA until July 29, 1981. 
The station site has since been demolished and replaced with a parking 
lot. Schuylkill Regional Medical Center is a non-profit affiliation between 
two community hospitals formerly known as Good Samaritan Regional Medical 
Center and The Pottsville Hospital and Warne Clinic, both of which are 
located in Pottsville. On August 1, 2008, Schuylkill Health became the 
new parent organization for both facilities and their related health systems.[15] 
The medical center is designated a Level III Trauma center by the Pennsylvania 
Trauma Systems Foundation.[16] Norwegian Street divides north and south 
in the city; Centre Street divides east and west. Since the city is built 
on steep hills, the street layout is more complex. Melanie and Devar Walters
