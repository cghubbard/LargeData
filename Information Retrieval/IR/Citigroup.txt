Citigroup Inc. or Citi (stylized as citi and pronounced like "city") is 
an American multinational investment banking and financial services corporation 
headquartered in Manhattan, New York City. Citigroup was formed from one 
of the world's largest mergers in history by combining the banking giant 
Citicorp and financial conglomerate Travelers Group in October 1998 (announced 
on April 7, 1998).[4][5][6] As of January 2015, it is the third largest 
bank holding company in the US by assets. Its largest shareholders include 
funds from the Middle East and Singapore.[7] At its height until the global 
financial crisis of 2008, Citigroup was the largest company and bank in 
the world as measured by total assets, with 357,000 employees.[8] In 2007, 
Citigroup was one of the primary dealers in US Treasury securities.[9] 
Citigroup had the world's largest financial services network, spanning 
140 countries with approximately 16,000 offices worldwide. It holds over 
200 million customer accounts in more than 140 countries. Citigroup suffered 
huge losses during the global financial crisis of 2008 and was rescued 
in November 2008 in a massive stimulus package by the U.S. government.[10] 
On February 27, 2009, Citigroup announced that the U.S. government would 
take a 36% equity stake in the company by converting US$25 billion in emergency 
aid into common stock with a US Treasury credit line of $45 billion to 
prevent the bankruptcy of the largest bank in the world at the time.[11] 
The government guaranteed losses on more than $300 billion troubled assets 
and injected $20 billion immediately into the company. In exchange, the 
salary of the CEO was set at $1 per year and the highest salary of employees 
was restricted to $500,000 in cash. Any compensation amount above $500,000 
had to be paid with restricted stock that could not be sold by the employee 
until the emergency government aid was repaid in full.[12] The U.S. government 
also gained control of half the seats in the Board of Directors, and the 
senior management was subjected to removal by the US government if there 
were poor performance. By December 2009, the U.S. government stake was 
reduced from a 36% stake to a 27% stake, after Citigroup sold $21 billion 
of common shares and equity in the largest single share sale in U.S. history, 
surpassing Bank of America's $19 billion share sale 1 month prior. By December 
2010, Citigroup repaid the emergency aid in full and the U.S. government 
received an additional $12 billion profit in selling its shares.[13][14][15][16][17] 
US Government restrictions on pay and oversight of the senior management 
were removed after the US government sold its remaining 27% stake as of 
December 2010. As of 2009, Citigroup was one of the Big Four banks in the 
United States, with Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo.[18][19][20][21][22][23][24] 
As of June 2012, the year of Citi's 200th anniversary, Citigroup had built 
up an enormous cash reserve in the wake of the financial crisis with $420 billion 
in surplus liquid cash and government securities.[25] As of Q1 2012, Citi 
had a tier 1 capital ratio of 12.4%, making Citi one of the best-capitalized 
financial institutions in the world after billions of dollars in losses 
from the financial crisis.[26] This was a result of selling more than $500 billion 
of its special assets placed in Citi Holdings, which were guaranteed from 
losses by the US Treasury while under federal majority ownership.[27] A 
special IRS tax exception given to Citi allowed the US Treasury to sell 
its shares at a profit, while it still owned Citigroup shares, which eventually 
netted $12 billion. According to Treasury spokeswoman Nayyera Haq, "This 
(IRS tax) rule was designed to stop corporate raiders from using loss corporations 
to evade taxes, and was never intended to address the unprecedented situation 
where the government owned shares in banks. And it was certainly not written 
to prevent the government from selling its shares for a profit."[28] In 
2016, Citigroup ranked 29th in size under the Fortune 500 list.[29] Citigroup 
was formed on October 9, 1998, following the $140 billion merger of Citicorp 
and Travelers Group to create the world's largest financial services organization.[6] 
The history of the company is, thus, divided into the workings of several 
firms that over time amalgamated into Citicorp, a multinational banking 
corporation operating in more than 100 countries; or Travelers Group, whose 
businesses covered credit services, consumer finance, brokerage, and insurance. 
As such, the company history dates back to the founding of: the City Bank 
of New York (later Citibank) in 1812; Bank Handlowy in 1870; Smith Barney 
in 1873, Banamex in 1884; Salomon Brothers in 1910.[30] City Bank of New 
York was chartered by New York State on June 16, 1812, with $2 million 
of capital. Serving a group of New York merchants, the bank opened for 
business on September 14 of that year, and Samuel Osgood was elected as 
the first President of the company.[31] The company's name was changed 
to The National City Bank of New York in 1865 after it joined the new U.S. 
national banking system, and it became the largest American bank by 1895.[31] 
It became the first contributor to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
in 1913, and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch 
of a U.S. bank in Buenos Aires, although the bank had, since the mid-19th 
century, been active in plantation economies, such as the Cuban sugar industry. 
The 1918 purchase of U.S. overseas bank International Banking Corporation 
helped it become the first American bank to surpass $1 billion in assets, 
and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in 1929.[31] As 
it grew, the bank became a leading innovator in financial services, becoming 
the first major U.S. bank to offer compound interest on savings (1921); 
unsecured personal loans (1928); customer checking accounts (1936) and 
the negotiable certificate of deposit (1961).[31][32][33] The bank changed 
its name to The First National City Bank of New York in 1955, which was 
shortened in 1962 to First National City Bank on the 150th anniversary 
of the company's foundation.[31] The company organically entered the leasing 
and credit card sectors, and its introduction of U.S. dollar–denominated 
certificates of deposit in London marked the first new negotiable instrument 
in market since 1888. The bank introduced its First National City Charge 
Service credit card—popularly known as the "Everything card" and later 
to become MasterCard—in 1967.[31] In 1976, under the leadership of CEO 
Walter B. Wriston, First National City Bank (and its holding company First 
National City Corporation) was renamed as Citibank, N.A. (and Citicorp, 
respectively). Shortly afterward, the bank launched the Citicard, which 
pioneered the use of 24-hour ATMs.[31] John S. Reed was elected CEO in 
1984, and Citi became a founding member of the CHAPS clearing house in 
London. Under his leadership, the next 14 years would see Citibank become 
the largest bank in the United States and the largest issuer of credit 
cards and charge cards in the world, and expand its global reach to over 
90 countries.[31][32][34] Travelers Group, at the time of merger, was a 
diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under 
CEO Sandy Weill. Its roots came from Commercial Credit, a subsidiary of 
Control Data Corporation that was taken private by Weill in November 1986 
after taking charge of the company earlier that year.[6][35] Two years 
later, Weill mastered the buyout of Primerica—a conglomerate that had already 
bought life insurer A L Williams as well as stock broker Smith Barney. 
The new company took the Primerica name, and employed a "cross-selling" 
strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed 
to sell each other's services. Its non-financial businesses were spun off.[35] 
In September 1992, Travelers Insurance, which had suffered from poor real 
estate investments[6] and sustained significant losses in the aftermath 
of Hurricane Andrew,[36] formed a strategic alliance with Primerica that 
would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in December 1993. 
With the acquisition, the group became Travelers Inc. Property & casualty 
and life & annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business.[35] 
Meanwhile, the distinctive Travelers red umbrella logo, which was also 
acquired in the deal, was applied to all the businesses within the newly 
named organization. During this period, Travelers acquired Shearson Lehman—a 
retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by Weill until 
1985[6]—and merged it with Smith Barney.[35] In November 1997, Travelers 
Group (which had been renamed again in April 1995 when they merged with 
Aetna Property and Casualty, Inc.), made the $9 billion deal to purchase 
Salomon Brothers, a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank.[35][37] 
This deal complemented Travelers/Smith Barney well as Salomon was focused 
on fixed-income and institutional clients, whereas Smith Barney was strong 
in equities and retail. Salomon Brothers absorbed Smith Barney into the 
new securities unit termed Salomon Smith Barney; a year later, the division 
incorporated Citicorp's former securities operations as well. The Salomon 
Smith Barney name was abandoned in October 2003 after a series of financial 
scandals that tarnished the bank's reputation.[citation needed] On April 
6, 1998, the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group was announced 
to the world, creating a $140 billion firm with assets of almost $700 billion.[6] 
The deal would enable Travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to 
Citicorp's retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to 
an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers. Although presented 
as a merger, the deal was actually more like a stock swap, with Travelers 
Group purchasing the entirety of Citicorp shares for $70 billion, and issuing 
2.5 new Citigroup shares for each Citicorp share. Through this mechanism, 
existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm.[6] 
While the new company maintained Citicorp's "Citi" brand in its name, it 
adopted Travelers' distinctive "red umbrella" as the new corporate logo, 
which was used until 2007. The chairmen of both parent companies, John 
Reed and Sandy Weill respectively, were announced as co-chairmen and co-CEOs 
of the new company, Citigroup, Inc., although the vast difference in management 
styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom 
of such a setup. The remaining provisions of the Glass–Steagall Act—enacted 
following the Great Depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters, 
and meant Citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited 
assets. However, Weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed 
"that over that time the legislation will change...we have had enough discussions 
to believe this will not be a problem".[6] Indeed, the passing of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley 
Act in November 1999 vindicated Reed and Weill's views, opening the door 
to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking, 
investment banking, insurance underwriting and brokerage.[38] Joe Plumeri 
worked on the post-merger integration of the two companies, and was appointed 
CEO of Citibank North America by Weill and Reed.[39][40] He oversaw its 
network of 450 retail branches.[40][41][42] J. Paul Newsome, an analyst 
with CIBC Oppenheimer, said: "He's not the spit-and-polish executive many 
people expected. He's rough on the edges. But Citibank knows the bank as 
an institution is in trouble—it can't get away anymore with passive selling—and 
Plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank."[43] 
Investment News speculated that a successful tenure at Citibank might lead 
to a promotion to head up all of Citicorp.[43] Plumeri boosted the unit's 
earnings from $108 million to $415 million in one year, an increase of 
nearly 300%.[44][45][46] He unexpectedly retired from Citibank, however, 
in January 2000.[47][48] In 2000, Citigroup acquired Associates First Capital 
Corporation, which, until 1989, had been owned by Gulf+Western (now part 
of National Amusements).[49] The Associates was widely criticized for predatory 
lending practices and Citi eventually settled with the Federal Trade Commission 
by agreeing to pay $240 million to customers who had been victims of a 
variety of predatory practices, including "flipping" mortgages, "packing" 
mortgages with optional credit insurance, and deceptive marketing practices.[50][51] 
In 2001, Citigroup made additional acquisitions: European American Bank, 
in July, for $1.9 billion,[52] and Banamex (assisted by independent adviser, 
Windsor Capital Investments Limited) in August, for $12.5 billion.[53] 
The company spun off its Travelers Property and Casualty insurance underwriting 
business in 2002.[54] The spin off was prompted by the insurance unit's 
drag on Citigroup stock price because Traveler's earnings were more seasonal 
and vulnerable to large disasters, particularly the September 11, 2001 
attacks on the World Trade Center in downtown New York City. It was also 
difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most 
industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker. 
The Travelers Property Casualty Corporation merged with The St. Paul Companies 
Inc. in 2004 forming The St. Paul Travelers Companies.[55] Citigroup retained 
the life insurance and annuities underwriting business; however, it sold 
those businesses to MetLife in 2005.[56] Citigroup still[when?] heavily 
sells all forms of insurance, but it no longer underwrites insurance.[citation 
needed] In spite of their divesting Travelers Insurance, Citigroup retained 
Travelers' signature red umbrella logo as its own until February 2007, 
when Citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to St. Paul Travelers,[57] 
which renamed itself Travelers Companies. Citigroup also decided to adopt 
the corporate brand "Citi" for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries, 
except Primerica and Banamex. Heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the 
form of collateralized debt obligation (CDOs), compounded by poor risk 
management, led Citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis 
worsened 2008. The company had used elaborate mathematical risk models 
which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas, but never included 
the possibility of a national housing downturn, or the prospect that millions 
of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages. Trading head Thomas 
Maheras was close friends with senior risk officer David Bushnell, which 
undermined risk oversight.[58][59] As Treasury Secretary, Robert Rubin 
was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed Travelers 
and Citicorp to merge in 1998. Then on the board of directors of Citigroup, 
Rubin and Charles Prince were said to be influential in pushing the company 
towards MBS and CDOs in the subprime mortgage market. Starting in June 
2006, Senior Vice President Richard M. Bowen III, the chief underwriter 
of Citigroup's Consumer Lending Group, began warning the board of directors 
about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could 
potentially result in massive losses. The group bought and sold $90 billion 
of residential mortgages annually. Bowen's responsibility was essentially 
to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the unit's creditworthiness. 
When Bowen first blew the whistle in 2006, 60% of the mortgages were defective. 
The amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout 2007 and eventually 
exceeded 80% of the volume. Many of the mortgages were not only defective, 
but were fraudulent. Bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports 
and other communications. On November 3, 2007, Bowen emailed Citigroup 
Chairman Robert Rubin and the bank's chief financial officer, head auditor 
and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential 
losses, claiming that the group's internal controls had broken down and 
requesting an outside investigation of his business unit. The subsequent 
investigation revealed that at the Consumer Lending Group had suffered 
a breakdown of internal controls since 2005. Regardless of the findings 
of the investigation, Bowen's charges were ignored, despite the fact that 
withholding such information from shareholders violated the Sarbanes–Oxley 
Act (SOX), which he had pointed out. Citigroup CEO Charles Prince signed 
a certification that the bank was in compliance with SOX despite Bowen 
revealing this wasn't so. Citigroup eventually stripped Bowen of most of 
his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no 
longer required at the bank. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission asked 
him to testify about Citigroup's role in the mortgage crisis, and he did 
so, appearing as one of the first witnesses before the Commission in April 
2010.[60][61] As the crisis began to unfold, Citigroup announced on April 
11, 2007, that it would eliminate 17,000 jobs, or about 5 percent of its 
workforce, in a broad restructuring designed to cut costs and bolster its 
long underperforming stock.[62] Even after securities and brokerage firm 
Bear Stearns ran into serious trouble in summer 2007, Citigroup decided 
the possibility of trouble with its CDO's was so tiny (less than 1/100 
of 1%) that they excluded them from their risk analysis. With the crisis 
worsening, Citigroup announced on January 7, 2008 that it was considering 
cutting another 5 percent to 10 percent of its 327,000 member-workforce.[63][64] 
By November 2008, Citigroup was insolvent, despite its receipt of $25 billion 
in tax-payer funded federal Troubled Asset Relief Program funds. On November 
17, 2008, Citigroup announced plans for about 52,000 new job cuts, on top 
of 23,000 cuts already made during 2008 in a huge job cull resulting from 
four quarters of consecutive losses and reports that it was unlikely to 
be in profit again before 2010. The same day on Wall Street markets responded, 
with shares falling and dropping the company's market capitalization to 
$6 billion, down from $300 billion two years prior.[65] Eventually staff 
cuts totaled over 100,000 employees.[66] Its stock market value dropped 
to $20.5 billion, down from $244 billion two years earlier.[65] Shares 
of Citigroup common stock traded well below $1.00 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. As a result, late in the evening on November 23, 2008, Citigroup 
and Federal regulators approved a plan to stabilize the company and forestall 
a further deterioration in the company's value. On November 24, 2008, the 
U.S. government announced a massive stimulus package for Citigroup designed 
to rescue the company from bankruptcy while giving the government a major 
say in its operations. A joint statement by the US Treasury Department, 
the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp announced: "With 
these transactions, the U.S. government is taking the actions necessary 
to strengthen the financial system and protect U.S. taxpayers and the U.S. 
economy."[67][68] The arrangement calls for the government to back about 
$306 billion in loans and securities and directly invest about $20 billion 
in the company. The Treasury would provide $20 billion in Troubled Asset 
Relief Program (TARP) funds in addition to $25 billion given in October. 
The Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC) would cover 90% of the losses on its $335 billion portfolio 
after Citigroup absorbed the first $29 billion in losses.[69] The assets 
remain on Citigroup's balance sheet; the technical term for this arrangement 
is ring fencing. In return the bank would give Washington $27 billion of 
preferred shares and warrants to acquire stock. The government would obtain 
wide powers over banking operations. Citigroup agreed to try to modify 
mortgages, using standards set up by the FDIC after the collapse of IndyMac 
Bank, with the goal of keeping as many homeowners as possible in their 
houses. Executive salaries would be capped[70] As a condition of the federal 
assistance, Citigroup's dividend payment was reduced to one cent per share. 
On January 16, 2009, Citigroup announced its intention to reorganize itself 
into two operating units: Citicorp for its retail and institutional client 
business, and Citi Holdings for its brokerage and asset management.[71] 
Citigroup will continue to operate as a single company for the time being, 
but Citi Holdings managers will be tasked to "take advantage of value-enhancing 
disposition and combination opportunities as they emerge",[71] and eventual 
spin-offs or mergers involving either operating unit were not ruled out.[72] 
On February 27, 2009 Citigroup announced that the United States government 
would be taking a 36% equity stake in the company by converting $25 billion 
in emergency aid into common shares. Citigroup shares dropped 40% on the 
news. On June 1, 2009, it was announced that Citigroup would be removed 
from the Dow Jones Industrial Average effective June 8, 2009, due to significant 
government ownership. Citigroup was replaced by Travelers Co.[73] In 2010, 
Citigroup achieved its first profitable year since 2007. It reported $10.6 billion 
in net profit, compared with a $1.6 billion loss in 2009.[74] Late in 2010, 
the government sold its remaining stock holding in the company, yielding 
an overall net profit to taxpayers of $12 billion.[75] On March 13, 2012, 
the Federal Reserve reported Citigroup is one of the four financial institutions, 
out of 19 major banks, that have failed its stress tests. The tests make 
sure banks have enough capital to withstand huge losses in a financial 
crisis like one Citigroup faced in 2008 and early 2009 when it almost collapsed. 
The 2012 stress tests determine whether banks could withstand a financial 
crisis that has unemployment at 13 percent, stock prices to be cut in half, 
and home prices decreased by 21 percent from current levels.[76][77] According 
to Citi and the Federal Reserve stress test report, Citi failed the Fed 
stress tests due to Citi's high capital return plan and its international 
loans rated by the Fed to be at higher risk than its domestic American 
loans.[78][79][80][81] Citi gets half their revenues from its international 
businesses. In comparison, Bank Of America, which passed the stress test 
and did not ask for a capital return to investors, gets 78% of its revenue 
in the United States.[82] On March 26, 2014, the Federal Reserve reported 
that Citigroup was one of the five financial institutions that had failed 
its stress tests, but that Citigroup had failed it again. Unlike in the 
failed stress test in 2012, the Fed failed Citigroup on qualitative concerns, 
which were left unresolved despite regulatory warnings, versus quantitative 
calculations. The report specifically states as quoted that Citigroup failed 
"to project revenues and losses under a stressful scenario for material 
parts of the firm's global operations and its ability to develop scenarios 
for its internal stress testing that adequately reflects its full range 
business activities and exposures." The Fed did not state the $400 million 
fraud at Oceanografia, which forced Citigroup to revise to lower earnings, 
as a reason.[83][84][85] On March 11, 2015, Citi has passed its first CCAR 
test,[86] allowing it to raise its dividend to 5 cent a share and unveiling 
a plan for a $7.8 billions of stock repurchase.[87] On June 23, 2016, Federal 
Reserve handed Citi a passing grade on its stress test the second time 
in a row, giving permission to triple its dividend to 16 cent a share and 
approving a $8.6 billion stock repurchase program ,[88] In May 2015, the 
bank announced it would be selling its margin foreign exchange business, 
including CitiFX Pro and TradeStream, to FXCM and Denmark’s SAXO Bank for 
an undisclosed amount.[89] In July 2015, Citi agreed to sell its retail 
and commercial banking operations in Panama and Costa Rica to Canada's 
Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank). The operations being sold include 27 
branches serving approximately 250,000 clients in the two countries. Citi 
will continue to offer corporate and institutional banking and wealth management 
in Panama and Costa Rica.[90] On March 2, 2015, Costco announced that Citigroup 
will become the exclusive issuer of Costco's credit cards and that Visa 
Inc. will replace American Express as the credit-card network for Costco’s 
stores starting on April 1, 2016. Costco will accept other Visa cards under 
the new agreement, as well.[91][92] In April 2016 Citigroup quarterly profits 
were reported as falling by 27% compared to a year earlier. The same month 
Citi was given regulatory approval for its 'living will,' the bank's plans 
to shut down operations in the event of another financial crisis.[93] Citi 
is organized into two major segments – Citicorp and Citi Holdings.[94][95] 
Citicorp contains two core businesses, i.e. Global Consumer Banking[96] 
and Institutional Clients Group,[97] while Citi Holdings contains Citi's 
non-core businesses, i.e. Brokerage and Asset Management (formerly includes 
Smith Barney), Global Consumer Finance, and Citi's Special Asset Portfolios.[98] 
Retail banking encompasses Citi's global branch network, branded Citibank. 
Citibank has more than 4,600 branches in the world and holds more than 
$300 billion deposits. Citibank is the fourth largest retail bank in the 
United States (Wells Fargo gained #3 spot in early 2016) based on deposits, 
and it has Citibank branded branches in countries throughout the world, 
with the exception of Mexico which is under a separate subsidiary called 
Banamex. Banamex, which serves about 20 million clients, is Mexico's largest 
local financial institution as measured by assets. Citibank offers Citibank/Citigold 
Checking and Savings accounts, Small Business and Commercial Banking and 
Personal Wealth Management among its services. In 2011, Citi is the first 
bank to introduce digitized Smart Banking branches in Washington, D.C., 
New York, Tokyo and Busan (South Korea) while continued renovating its 
entire branch network.[99][100] New sales and service centers were also 
opened in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Citi Express modules, 24-hour service 
units, were introduced in Colombia. Citi recently opened new branches in 
three new cities in China as part of its plan to expand Citi's presence 
in People's Republic of China to 13 cities. Additionally, Citibank offers 
Citigold services world-wide to mass affluent clients with at least $50,000 
USD in liquid assets. In certain markets, Citigold Select is available 
for clients with at least $500,000 in liquid assets.[101] Its highest tiered 
service, Citigold Private Client, is for high-net-worth individuals with 
at least $1–$3 million in liquid assets (depending on the market region) 
and offers access to investments and ideas from Citi Private Bank.[102][103][104][105][106] 
Citi Branded Cards is one of the world's largest credit card issuers. Citi 
Branded Cards is responsible for around 40% of the profits with GCB, and 
represents the largest issuer of credit cards across the world as well 
as a 3,800-point ATM network across 45 countries. Citi Branded Cards introduced 
several new products in 2011, including: Citi ThankYou, Citi Executive/AAdvantage 
and Citi Simplicity cards in the U.S.. It also has Latin America partnership 
cards with Colombia-based airline Avianca and with Banamex and AeroMexico; 
and a merchant loyalty program in Europe. Citibank is also the first and 
currently the only international bank to be approved by Chinese regulators 
to issue credit cards under its own brand without cooperating with Chinese 
state-owned domestic banks.[107] Citi Retail Services moved from Citi Holdings 
to become part of GCB in 2012 after expanding several existing partnerships 
with retail clients, and re-branding to reflect the suite of services offered 
to partners.[108] It is one of the largest providers of consumer and commercial 
credit card products, services, and retail solutions in the U.S.[109] Commercial 
Banking at Citi serves 100,000 small to medium-size companies in 32 countries.[110] 
CitiMortgage services real estate mortgages.[111][112] Citi's Institutional 
Clients Group (ICG) offers investment and corporate banking services and 
products for corporates, governments, institutions, and ultra high-net-worth 
investors. Containing Citi's most market-sensitive divisions, ICG consists 
of five main divisions: Citi Capital Markets Origination, Citi Markets 
& Securities Services (including Citi Research), Citi Corporate & Investment 
Banking, Citi Private Bank, and Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions. Citi's 
Capital Markets Origination business is focused on the capital-raising 
needs for institutional clients. It is a spin-off of its former Citi Markets 
division. Former Transactions Service unit, Securities Funds Services, 
was merged with Citi Markets to form Citi Markets & Securities Services. 
The current unit includes Investor Services and Direct Custody and Clearing, 
Hedge and Private Equity Servicing, and Issuer businesses. It provides 
financial products through underwriting, sales & trading of a range of 
investment assets. Products offered include equities, commodities, credit, 
futures, foreign exchange (FX), emerging markets, G10 rates, municipals, 
prime finance/brokerage services, and securitized markets, such as collateralized 
debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities.[113] Its Citi Research 
team provides equity and fixed income research, company, sector, economic 
and geographic market analysis, and product-specific analysis for Citi's 
individual and institutional clients. Its flagship research reports include 
the following: Portfolio Strategist, Bond Market Roundup, U.S. Economics 
Weekly, International Market Roundup, Global Economic Outlook & Strategy 
and the Global Equity Strategist.[114] Citi Corporate & Investment Banking 
provides strategic and financing products and advisory services to multinational 
and local corporations, financial institutions, governments, and privately 
held businesses in more than 160 countries. Moreover, it includes client 
services such as Mergers & Acquisitions activities as well as Initial Public 
Offerings. Citi Corporate & Investment Banking won several awards in 2011, 
including International Financing Review's Best Americas Securitization 
for Ford Credit, Best Emerging Asia Bond for Pertamina, Best Latin America 
Bond for Petrobras, Best Emerging EMEA Bond for VimpelCom, Best Yen Bond 
for Panasonic, Best Senior Financial Bond for Capital One and Best Americas 
Structure Equity Issue for AIB/MetLife.[115] Citi Private Bank is an advisor 
to ultra high-net-worth individuals and families throughout the world. 
It uses an open architecture network of more than 800 private bankers and 
investment professionals across 46 countries and jurisdictions to provide 
clients access to global investment opportunities. It has about $250 billion 
in assets under management. The minimum net worth requirement is $25 million 
in liquid assets and is waived for only law firm groups and other clients 
under special circumstances.[116] Formerly part of Global Wealth Management, 
Citi Private Bank was merged into Citi's Institutional Clients Group. Unlike 
many of its competitors, since 2009 Citi Private Bank no longer pays its 
bankers with commission for selling investment products. Former CEO of 
Citi Private Bank, Jane Fraser, said the move was meant to bolster Citi 
Private Bank as an independent wealth management adviser, as opposed to 
a product pusher.[117][118] Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) [119] 
provides cash management, trade and securities services to companies, governments, 
and other institutions in the U.S. and more than 140 countries. TTS intermediates 
more than $3 trillion in global transactions daily. It has over $13 trillion 
assets under custody, about $377 billion in average liability balances, 
serves 99% of world's Fortune 100 companies and ~85% of the world's Fortune 
500 companies, and has 10 regional processing centers worldwide using global 
processes. Institutions use TTS to support their treasury operations with 
global solutions for payments, collections, liquidity and investments by 
working in partnership with export credit agencies and development banks. 
It also sells supply chain financing products as well as medium- and long-term 
global financing programs across multiple industries. In 2011, clients 
doing business with Citi in 10 or more countries generated more than 60 
percent of Transaction Services' total revenues. According to the Wall 
Street Journal, the government aid provided to Citi in 2008/2009 was provided 
to prevent a world-wide chaos and panic by the potential collapse of its 
Global Transactions Services (now TTS) division. According to the article, 
former CEO Pandit said if Citigroup was allowed to unravel into bankruptcy, 
"100 governments around the world would be trying to figure out how to 
pay their employees".[120][121][122][123][124] Citi Holdings consists of 
Citi businesses that Citi wants to sell and are not considered part of 
Citi's core businesses. The majority of its assets are U.S. mortgages. 
It was created in the wake of the financial crisis as part of Citi's restructuring 
plan. It consists of several business entities including remaining interests 
in local consumer lending such as OneMain Financial, divestitures such 
as Smith Barney, and a special asset pool. Citi Holdings represents $156 
billion of GAAP assets, or ~8% of Citigroup; 59% represents North American 
mortgages, 18% operating businesses, 13% special asset pool, and 10% categorized 
as other. Operating businesses include OneMain Financial ($10B), PrimeRe 
($7B), MSSB JV ($8B) and Spain / Greece retail ($4B), less associated loan 
loss reserves. While Citi Holdings is a mixed bag, its primary objective 
is to wind down some non-core businesses and reduce assets, and strategically 
"breaking even" in 2015.[125] In October 2014, Citigroup announced it will 
exit consumer banking in 11 markets, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Japan, Guam, the Czech Republic, Egypt, 
South Korea (consumer finance only), and Hungary.[126] Morgan Stanley Smith 
Barney was previously Citi Smith Barney, Citi's global private wealth management 
unit, providing brokerage, investment banking and asset management services 
to corporations, governments and individuals around the world. With over 
800 offices worldwide, Smith Barney held 9.6 million domestic client accounts, 
representing $1.562 trillion in client assets worldwide.[127] Citi announced 
on January 13, 2009 that they would give Smith Barney to Morgan Stanley 
investment bank to combine their brokerage firms in exchange for $2.7 billion 
and 49% interest in the joint venture.[128][129] The remaining 49% stake 
of Smith Barney owned by Citi was later sold for $13.5 billion following 
an appraisal by Perella Weinberg.[130] Citi Capital Advisors (CCA),[131] 
formerly Citi Alternative Investments, was a Citi Hedge fund that offers 
various investment strategies across multiple asset classes, ranging from 
market strategies to infrastructure and private equity investing for institutional 
and high-net-worth investors. Due to US regulations as part of the Volcker 
rule to limit bank ownership in hedge funds to no more than 3%, Citi spun 
off its hedge fund unit with its managers owning a significant part of 
the new company.[132] The spin-off of CCA created Napier Park Global Capital, 
a $6.8 billion hedge fund with more than 100 employees in New York and 
London. The new company will be managed by Jim O’Brien and Jonathan Dorfman, 
who would serve as co-CEOs and were former Citi executives managing CCA. 
Citigroup will continue to retain a sizable minority position in the new 
firm, but will slowly withdraw its capital over time by the July 2014 deadline 
stipulated by the Volcker Rule.[133][134][135][136] In March, 2015, Springleaf 
Financial entered into an agreement to acquire OneMain Financial from Citigroup.[137] 
Citigroup's most famous office building is the Citigroup Center, a diagonal-roof 
skyscraper located in East Midtown, Manhattan, New York City, which despite 
popular belief is not the company's headquarters building. Citigroup has 
its headquarters across the street in an anonymous-looking building at 
399 Park Avenue (the site of the original location of the City National 
Bank).[138] The headquarters is outfitted with nine luxury dining rooms, 
with a team of private chefs preparing a different menu each day. The management 
team is on the second and third floors above a Citibank branch. Citigroup 
also leases a building in Tribeca at 388 Greenwich Street that serves as 
headquarters for its Investment and Corporate Banking operations and was 
the former headquarters of the Travelers Group.[139] All of Citigroup's 
New York City real estate, excluding the company's Smith Barney division 
and Wall Street trading division, lies along the New York City Subway's 
IND Queens Boulevard Line, served by the E M trains. Consequently, the 
company's Midtown buildings—including 787 Seventh Avenue, 666 Fifth Avenue, 
399 Park Avenue, 485 Lexington, 153 East 53rd Street (Citigroup Center) 
in Manhattan, and Citigroup Building in Long Island City, Queens, are all 
on the short four-stop corridor of the Queens Boulevard Line between Court 
Square and Seventh Avenue.[140] Chicago also plays home to a building operated 
by Citigroup. Citicorp Center has a series of curved archways at its peak, 
and sits across the street from major competitor ABN AMRO's ABN AMRO Plaza. 
It has shops and restaurants serving Metra customers via the Ogilvie Transportation 
Center.[141] Citigroup has obtained naming rights to Citi Field, the home 
ballpark of the New York Mets Major League Baseball team, who began playing 
their home games there in 2009.[142] In 2004, Japanese regulators took 
action against Citibank Japan loaning to a customer involved in stock manipulation. 
The regulator suspended bank activities in one branch and three offices, 
and restricted their consumer banking division. In 2009, Japanese regulators 
again took action against Citibank Japan, because the bank had not set 
up an effective money laundering monitoring system. The regulators suspended 
sales operations within Citibank's retail banking for a month.[143] On 
March 23, 2005, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the former 
name of the American self-regulatory organization for broker-dealers, now 
known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FInRA) announced 
total fines of $21.25 million against Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., American 
Express Financial Advisors and Chase Investment Services regarding suitability 
and supervisory violations of their mutual fund sales practices between 
January 2002 and July 2003. The case against Citigroup involved recommendations 
and sales of Class B and Class C shares of mutual funds.[144] On June 6, 
2007, FInRA announced more than $15 million in fines and restitution against 
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., to settle charges related to misleading 
documents and inadequate disclosure in retirement seminars and meetings 
for BellSouth Corp. employees in North Carolina and South Carolina. FInRA 
found that Citigroup did not properly supervise a team of brokers located 
in Charlotte, N.C., who used misleading sales materials during dozens of 
seminars and meetings for hundreds of BellSouth employees.[145] In July 
2010, Citigroup agreed to pay $75 million to settle civil charges that 
it misled investors over potential losses from high-risk mortgages. The 
Securities and Exchange Commission said that Citigroup had made misleading 
statements about the company's exposure to subprime mortgages. In 2007, 
Citigroup indicated that their exposure was less than $13 billion, when 
in fact it was over $50 billion.[146] In April 2011, an arbitration panel 
ordered Citigroup Inc to pay $54.1 million for losses from municipal securities 
funds that cratered between 2007 and 2008.[147] In August 2012, Citigroup 
agreed to pay almost $25 million to settle an investor lawsuit alleging 
the bank misled investors about the nature of mortgage-backed securities. 
The lawsuit was on behalf of investors who purchased certificates in one 
of two mortgage-backed securities trusts from Citigroup Mortgage Loan Trust 
Inc in 2007.[148] In February 2012, Citigroup agreed to pay $158.3 million 
to settle claims that it falsely certified the quality of loans issued 
by its CitiMortgage unit over a period of more than six years, so that 
they would qualify for insurance from the Federal Housing Administration. 
The lawsuit was initially brought by Sherry Hunt, a CitiMortgage employee.[149][150] 
On February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers 
(Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed 
to a historic settlement with the federal government and 49 states.[151] 
The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required 
the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners 
and in direct payments to the states and federal government. This settlement 
amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, 
only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.[152] The five banks 
were also required to comply with 305 new mortgage servicing standards. 
Oklahoma held out and agreed to settle with the banks separately. In 2014, 
Citigroup agreed to pay $7 billion to resolve claims it misled investors 
about shoddy mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial 
crisis. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said "The bank’s misconduct 
was egregious. [...] As a result of their assurances that toxic financial 
products were sound, Citigroup was able to expand its market share and 
increase profits" and that "the settlement did not absolve the bank or 
its employees from facing criminal charges."[153] In July 2015, Citigroup 
was fined $70 million by the United States Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and ordered to 
pay $700 million to customers. Citigroup had conducted illegal practices 
in marketing add-on products for credit cards, including credit monitoring, 
debt-protection products and wallet-protection services.[154] On October 
22, 2001, Citigroup was sued for violating federal securities laws by misrepresenting 
Citigroup's Enron-related exposure in its 2001 Annual Report and elsewhere, 
and failing to disclose the true extent of Citigroup's legal liability 
arising out of its 'structured finance' deals with Enron.[155] In 2003, 
Citigroup paid $145 million in fines and penalties to settle claims by 
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Manhattan district attorney's 
office.[156] In 2004, Citigroup paid $2.65 billion to settle a lawsuit 
concerning their role in selling stocks and bonds for WorldCom, the second 
largest telecommunications company in the world, inflating the earnings 
for 2001 and the first quarter of 2002,[157] and paid $2.575 billion for 
settlement, which collapsed in 2002 in an accounting scandal.[158][159] 
In 2005, Citigroup paid $75 million to settle a lawsuit from investors 
in Global Crossing, which filed bankruptcy in 2002.[160] Citigroup was 
accused of issuing exaggerated research reports and not disclosing conflicts 
of interest.[161] On February 5, 2002, Citigroup Inc had a lawsuit for 
violating federal securities laws and misled investors by issuing false 
information about Global Crossing’s and Asia Global Crossing’s revenues 
and financial performance,[162] and paid $75 million for settlement. In 
2005, Citigroup paid $2 billion to settle a lawsuit filed by investors 
in Enron.[163][164] On November 8, 2007, Citigroup was sued manipulating 
and inflating its stock price by misrepresentations and omissions of what 
amounted to more than two years of income and an entire line of business,[165] 
and paid $590 million for settlement. Class action service companies like 
Chicago Clearing Corporation helped many financial institutions, like hedge 
funds, mutual funds, and bank trust, regain this money after holding what 
appeared to be a seemingly safe investment.[citation needed] In 2008, Citigroup 
paid $1.66 billion to the Enron Bankruptcy Estate, which represented creditors 
of the bankrupt company.[166][167] In 2008, Citigroup paid out over $3 billion 
in fines and legal settlements for their role in financing Enron Corporation, 
which collapsed amid a financial scandal in 2001.[166] In 1998, the General 
Accounting Office issued a report critical of Citibank's handling of funds 
received from Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of Carlos Salinas, the former 
president of Mexico. The report, titled "Raul Salinas, Citibank and Alleged 
Money Laundering," indicated that Citibank facilitated the transfer of 
millions of dollars through complex financial transactions that hid the 
funds' paper trail. The report indicated that Citibank took on Salinas 
as a client without making a thorough inquiry as to how he made his fortune, 
an omission that a Citibank official called a violation of the bank's "know 
your customer" policy.[168] In December 2002, Citigroup paid fines totaling 
$400 million, to states and the federal government as part of a settlement 
involving charges that ten banks, including Citigroup, deceived investors 
with biased research. The total settlement with the ten banks was $1.4 billion. 
The settlement required that the banks separate investment banking from 
research, and ban any allocation of IPO shares.[169] Citigroup was criticized 
for disrupting the European bond market by rapidly selling €11 billion 
worth of bonds on August 2, 2004 on the MTS Group trading platform, driving 
down the price, and then buying it back at cheaper prices.[170] In a leaked 
report for their very wealthy clients from 2005, a team of global strategists 
at Citigroup wrote an analysis of the global distribution of wealth and 
consumers. In it, they state that global imbalances have grown to the extent 
as to justify talking of a plutonomy, and demand for a renewed understanding 
of how this impacts consumption. The authors cite data showing that the 
top 1% households in the US economy account for about 20% of the total 
income in 2000, which is roughly equal to the share of the bottom 60% of 
households put together. Moreover, in terms of wealth they demonstrate 
even more inequality such that "[T]he top 1% of households also account 
for 33% of net worth, greater than the bottom 90% of households put together. 
It gets better (or worse, depending on your political stripe) - the top 
1% of households account for 40% of financial net worth, more than the 
bottom 95% of households put together."[171]:3 Of the current plutonomies 
(namely United States, United Kingdom, and Canada), they describe six key 
drivers: "...an ongoing [bio-]technological revolution; capitalist-friendly 
governments and tax regimes; globalization that re-arranges global supply 
chains with mobile well-capitalized elites and immigrants; greater financial 
complexity and innovation; the rule of law, and patent protection are all 
well."[171]:9 In the report, the authors advocate to maintain unequal distribution 
of wealth in the sense that "…society and governments need to be amenable 
to disproportionately allow/encourage the few to retain that fatter profit 
share. The Managerial Aristocracy, like in the Gilded Age, the Roaring 
Twenties, and the thriving nineties, needs to commandeer a vast chunk of 
that rising profit share, either through capital income, or simply paying 
itself a lot."[171]:10 Moreover, the authors say that in industrialize 
countries, there seems to be a relationship between income concentration 
(plutonomy) and the household savings rates such that the latter tend to 
fall in plutonomies.[171]:18 The ultimate objective of their report is 
to examine how to make money of this.[171]:21 The report has also figured 
in Michael Moore's Capitalism: A love Story. In a New York Times op-ed, 
Michael Lewis and David Einhorn described the November 2008 $306 billion 
guarantee as "an undisguised gift" without any real crisis motivating it.[172] 
According to New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, Citigroup paid hundreds 
of millions of dollars in bonuses to more than 1,038 of its employees after 
it had received its $45 billion TARP funds in late 2008. This included 
738 employees each receiving $1 million in bonuses, 176 employees each 
receiving $2 million bonuses, 124 each receiving $3 million in bonuses, 
and 143 each receiving bonuses of $4 million to more than $10 million.[173] 
As a result of the criticism and the U.S. Government's majority holding 
of Citigroup's common shares, compensation and bonuses were restricted 
from February 2009 until December 2010.[citation needed] In November 2007 
it became public that Citigroup was heavily involved in the Terra Securities 
scandal, which involved investments by eight municipalities of Norway in 
various hedge funds in the United States bond market.[174] The funds were 
sold by Terra Securities ASA to the municipalities, while the products 
were delivered by Citigroup. Terra Securities ASA filed for bankruptcy 
November 28, 2007, the day after they received a letter[175] from the Financial 
Supervisory Authority of Norway announcing withdrawal of permissions to 
operate. The letter stated, "The Supervisory Authority contends that Citigroup's 
presentation, as well as the presentation from Terra Securities ASA, appears 
insufficient and misleading because central elements like information about 
potential extra payments and the size of these are omitted." In August 
2008, Citigroup agreed to pay nearly $18 million in refunds and fines to 
settle accusations by California Attorney General Jerry Brown that it wrongly 
took funds from the accounts of credit card customers. Citigroup would 
pay $14 million of restitution to roughly 53,000 customers nationwide. 
A three-year investigation found that Citigroup from 1992 to 2003 used 
an improper computerized "sweep" feature to move positive balances from 
card accounts into the bank's general fund, without telling cardholders.[176] 
Brown said that Citigroup "knowingly stole from its customers, mostly poor 
people and the recently deceased, when it designed and implemented the 
sweeps...When a whistleblower uncovered the scam and brought it to his 
superiors [in 2001], they buried the information and continued the illegal 
practice."[176] In September 2011, former Wall Street reporter Ron Suskind 
stated that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ignored a 2009 order from 
President Barack Obama to break up Citigroup in an enormous restructuring 
and liquidation process.[177][page needed] According to Suskind, Obama 
wanted to restructure the bank into several leaner and smaller companies 
while Geithner was executing stress tests of American financial institutions. 
Robert Kuttner wrote in his 2010 book A Presidency in Peril that in spring 
2009, Geithner and chief economic adviser Larry Summers believed that they 
could not seize, liquidate and break up Citigroup because they lacked the 
legal authority or the tools to do so.[page needed] The Treasury Department 
denied Suskind's account in an e-mail to the media stating "This account 
is simply untrue. The directive given by the president in March 2009, was 
to develop a contingency plan for tough restructurings if the government 
ended up owning large shares of institutions at the conclusion of the stress 
tests that Secretary Geithner worked aggressively to put in place as part 
of the Administration's Financial Stability Plan. While Treasury began 
work on those contingency plans, there was fortunately never a need to 
put them in place."[178][179] At Citi's 2012 annual shareholders' meeting 
on April 17, Citi's executive compensation package was rejected, with approximately 
55% of the votes being against approval. The non-binding vote was required 
under the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires corporations to hold advisory 
shareholder votes on their executive compensation plans. Many shareholders 
expressed concerns about Citi's failed 2012 Fed stress test and lack of 
long-term performance-based metrics in its executive compensation plan. 
One of the largest and most activist of the shareholders voting no, the 
California Public Employees' Retirement System, stated Citi "has not anchored 
rewards to performance".[180] A Citigroup shareholder filed a lawsuit days 
after the vote, claiming Citi executives breached their fiduciary duties.[181] 
In response, Richard Parsons, former chairman of Citigroup, called the 
vote a "serious matter". A spokeswoman for Citi said "Citi's Board of Directors 
takes the shareholder vote seriously, and along with senior management 
will consult with representative shareholders to understand their concerns" 
and that the Compensation committee of the Board "will carefully consider 
their (shareholder) input as we move forward".[182][183][184][185] Between 
1998 and 2014, Citigroup spent nearly $100 million lobbying the federal 
government.[186] As of 2008, Citigroup was the 16th largest political campaign 
contributor in the US, out of all organizations, according to the Center 
for Responsive Politics. From 1989 to 2006, members of the firm donated 
over $23,033,490, 49% of which went to Democrats and 51% of which went 
to Republicans.[187] Matthew Vadum, a senior editor at the conservative 
Capital Research Center, acknowledged these figures, but pointed out that 
Citigroup had been "a longtime donor to left-wing pressure groups", and 
referred to a Capital Research Center Foundation Watch 2006 study of Fortune 
100 foundation giving, where Citigroup's foundation gave "20 times more 
money to groups on the left than to groups on the right" during tax year 
2003.[188] In 2014 Citigroup’s PAC contributed $804,000 to campaigns of 
various members of Congress, i.e. 162 members of the House, including 72 
Democrats, where donations averaged about $5,000 per candidate. Of the 
57 Democrats supporting the 2015 Spending bill, 34 had received campaign 
cash from Citigroup’s PAC at some point since 2010.[189] Citigroup’s 2014 
donations favored Republicans only slightly. The bank’s PAC had been nearly 
as generous to Democrats as Republicans – $30,000 to the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee (the maximum) and $10,000 to the 'New Democrat Coalition', 
a group of moderate Democrats most of whom voted for the 2015 spending 
package. Citibank’s PAC made donations to both the campaigns and the leadership 
PACs of many top Democrats who voted for the 2015 spending bill, including 
Steny Hoyer (Md.) House Democratic Whip and Representatives Jim Himes (D-Conn.) 
and Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Florida.).[189] In 2009, former chairman 
Richard Parsons hired long-time Washington, D.C. lobbyist Richard F. Hohlt 
to advise him and the company about relations with the U.S. government, 
though not to lobby for the company. While some speculated anonymously 
that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) would have been a 
particular focus of Hohlt's attention, Hohlt said he'd had no contact with 
the government insurance corporation. Some former regulators found room 
to criticize Hohlt's involvement with Citigroup, because of his earlier 
involvement with the financial-services industry during the savings and 
loan crisis of the 1980s. Hohlt responded that though mistakes were made 
in the earlier episode he'd never been investigated by any government agency 
and his experience gave him reason to be back in the "operating room" as 
parties address the more recent crisis.[190] In 2010, the company named 
Edward Skyler, formerly in New York City government and at Bloomberg LP, 
to its senior public and governmental relations position.[191] Before Skyler 
was named and before he began his job search, the company reportedly held 
discussions with three other individuals to fill the position: NY Deputy 
Mayor Kevin Sheekey, Mayor Michael Bloomberg's "political guru ... [who] 
spearheaded ... his short-lived flirtation with a presidential run ..., 
who will soon leave City Hall for a position at the mayor's company, Bloomberg 
L.P. .... After Mr. Bloomberg's improbable victory in the 2001 mayor's 
race, both Mr. Skyler and Mr. Sheekey followed him from his company to 
City Hall. Since then, they have been a part of an enormously influential 
coterie of advisers"; Howard Wolfson, the former communications director 
for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and Mr. Bloomberg's re-election 
bid; and Gary Ginsberg, now at Time Warner and formerly at News Corporation.[192]
