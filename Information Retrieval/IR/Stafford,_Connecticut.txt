Stafford is a town in Tolland County, Connecticut, United States, settled 
in 1719. The population was 12,192 at the 2010 census. The Colonial Town 
of Stafford began as a rural agricultural community in the eastern part 
of Hartford County. It became part of Tolland County upon the latter's 
formation on 13 October 1785. The easy availability of water power from 
the tributaries of the Willimantic River led to industrialization, and 
this abundance of power helped generate local population growth. By the 
mid-19th century, Stafford was connected by railroad to markets across 
New England, and before the State Highway projects of the 1920s and 1930s, 
the town had a trolley connection to Rockville, CT. During the Civil War, 
factories in Stafford made cannonballs and other war supplies for the northern 
forces. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total 
area of 58.8 sq mi (152.2 km2), of which, 58.0 sq mi (150.1 km2) of it 
is land and 0.81 sq mi (2.1 km2) of it (1.38%) is water; it is the 3rd 
largest town in Connecticut based on area. Stafford Springs is located 
at the intersection of Routes 190 and 32, in the northeastern region of 
the state. The community consists of the downtown area of Stafford Springs 
and the more rural villages of Crystal Lake, Ellithorpe, Hydeville, Orcuttsville, 
Staffordville, Stafford Hollow, Village Hill, and West Stafford. While 
the town has managed to maintain its New England mill-town charm and culture, 
it is also a bedroom commuter town feeding into larger area communities. 
Many residents drive into Hartford, Manchester, and Enfield, Connecticut, 
as well as Springfield, Massachusetts, all of which can be reached in about 
a 30-mile auto commute. It is also about a half-hour drive to the University 
of Connecticut's[1] main campus in Storrs. The highest point in town is
