Ubaldo Jiménez García (born January 22, 1984) is a Dominican-American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He has also played for the Colorado Rockies and the Cleveland Indians. 
Jiménez was an MLB All-Star in 2010. That year, he pitched the first no-hitter 
in Rockies' franchise history. Jimenez earned his 100th career victory 
on September 22, 2015 as a member of the Baltimore Orioles, while pitching 
against the Washington Nationals. Jiménez made his Major League Baseball 
debut on September 26, 2006. He came in as a relief pitcher for the Colorado 
Rockies during the eighth inning of an 11–4 home loss to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers.[1] He allowed two hits and no runs. He would make his first major 
league start on October 1 against the Chicago Cubs on the road, which was 
the last game of the regular season. Jiménez allowed three hits and three 
earned runs over a span of 6 2⁄3 innings in an 8–5 loss. He didn't receive 
a decision for the game.[2] Jiménez earned his first major league win on 
July 29, 2007 at home against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He pitched six innings, 
giving up four hits and two earned runs.[3] The Rockies won the game, 9–6. 
On September 5, he gained the distinction of giving up Barry Bonds's 762nd 
and final career home run.[4] Jiménez made his Major League Baseball postseason 
debut on October 6 during Game 3 of the 2007 National League Division Series 
in Colorado against the Philadelphia Phillies. He started the game and 
pitched six innings, allowing three hits and one earned run, as part of 
a 2–1 victory (the win gave the Rockies a series sweep over the Phillies).[5] 
However, Jiménez didn't receive a decision for the game. He started his 
second consecutive game of the postseason on October 12, which was Game 
2 of the 2007 National League Championship Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks 
on the road. He pitched five innings, giving up one hit and one earned 
run. The Rockies would eventually win the game, 3–2, but Jiménez received 
his second straight postseason no-decision.[6] Colorado swept Arizona and 
faced the Boston Red Sox in the 2007 World Series. Jiménez started Game 
2, suffering a 2–1 loss in Boston. He allowed three hits and two earned 
runs in 4 2⁄3 innings.[7] Boston went on to sweep Colorado. In 2008, Jiménez 
went 12–12 with a 3.99 earned run average. His 34 starts led the National 
League.[8] He threw the fastest fastball among starters in the Major Leagues, 
averaging 94.9 mph.[9] During the 2008 offseason, Jiménez signed a four-year, 
$10-million dollar contract with a club option up to 2013–14.[10] In the 
2009 season, he went 15–12 with a 3.47 ERA, his second full season as a 
starter in the majors. Jiménez pitched at least six innings in a franchise-record 
25 consecutive starts from May 1 – September 7.[11] Jiménez pitched for 
the Dominican Republic during the 2009 World Baseball Classic. On March 
10, he set a single-start strikeout record, fanning 10 of the 13 batters 
he faced during his 65-pitch, four-inning performance in Round One against 
the Netherlands.[12] On April 17, 2010, Jiménez no-hit the Atlanta Braves 
4-0 at Turner Field, the first no-hitter in the history of the franchise. 
He walked 6 batters, while striking out 7, and throwing a career-high 128 
pitches (72 for strikes).[13] He faced 31 batters in the game. The no-hitter 
was preserved by a diving catch in center field by Dexter Fowler in the 
bottom of the seventh inning. Jiménez's fastball reached 100 mph three 
times during the game, and it averaged 96.8 mph. During the no-hitter, 
Jiménez switched from the windup to the stretch delivery after issuing 
a lead-off walk in the fifth inning (his sixth total walk of the game). 
Following the switch, he didn't allow a walk for the remainder of the game.[14] 
Jiménez also helped his own cause offensively, scoring Brad Hawpe with 
a fourth-inning single; he himself scored on a Carlos González double one 
batter later. Jiménez was named the National League Pitcher of the Month 
for April, becoming the second pitcher in Rockies history to win a Pitcher 
of the Month award.[15] Jiménez was only the second pitcher in MLB history 
to throw a no-hitter and notch five wins in the month of April. He also 
set a franchise record for consecutive scoreless innings ( 22 1⁄3) for 
a starting pitcher (the streak was eventually snapped on May 3 after 25 1⁄3 
straight scoreless innings).[16] He broke that mark shortly thereafter, 
as he went 33 straight scoreless innings from May to June, which was a 
franchise record for not only starting pitchers, but relievers as well 
(Gabe White previously held the team record of 29 consecutive scoreless 
innings).[17] Jiménez became the first pitcher since Jack Morris in 1986 
to have two streaks of at least 25 consecutive scoreless innings in one 
season.[18] He was again named National League Pitcher of the Month for 
May. He became the first pitcher in Rockies history to win the award more 
than once and the first pitcher since Pedro Martínez in 1999 to win the 
award in April and May.[18] Jiménez was the third pitcher in MLB history 
to win 11 out of his first 12 games and have an ERA below 1.00 (0.93).[19] 
He had the lowest ERA (0.78) in MLB history through 11 starts. In his one 
loss, he went seven innings, giving up two hits and one earned run in a 
2–0 road loss against the Los Angeles Dodgers.[20] On July 4, 2010, Jiménez 
was one of two Rockies, along with shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, selected 
as a National League All-Star to play in the 2010 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game at Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California. He entered 
the game leading all Major League pitchers with a 15–1 record and a 2.20 
ERA (as of July 8). On July 12, 2010, Jiménez was named the starting pitcher 
for the National League All-Star team ahead of fellow NL aces Tim Lincecum, 
Roy Halladay, and Adam Wainwright.[21] In two scoreless innings he threw 
25 pitches with two hits, one strikeout, one walk, and 3 baserunners.[22] 
2010 was the NL's first All-Star win since 1996 and Jiménez's first All-Star 
selection. Jiménez would finish the season on a rough note, going 4–7 after 
the All star break. Jiménez finished 19–8 and an ERA of 2.88 in 221.1 innings 
pitched for the Rockies. The following season, Jiménez through 21 starts 
was 6–9 for the Rockies, who at the time were considering trading Ubaldo. 
On July 31, 2011, Jiménez was traded to the Cleveland Indians in exchange 
for Alex White, Joe Gardner, Matt McBride and Drew Pomeranz.[23] Tom Verducci 
wrote in Sports Illustrated shortly before the trade "Jimenez has terrific 
stuff, a powerful frame and the work ethic of a blast furnace" but was 
working an alarming number of innings in high altitude conditions and putting 
strain on the Rockies' ace.[24] Jiménez would later recount the difficult 
days he had with the Rockies organization in a 2012 interview during spring 
training. "It was kind of hard being with the Rockies. I went through a 
lot of things people outside the organization don't know. But me and the 
people in the front office know."[25] On April 2, 2012, Jiménez was suspended 
five games by MLB for hitting former teammate Troy Tulowitzki with a pitch 
on the elbow the previous day. They walked toward each other and were separated, 
but no punches were thrown and no ejections were made. Jiménez was in conflict 
with Tulowitzki after he and former teammate Carlos González got lucrative 
contract extensions after the 2010 season, while Jiménez did not.[26] He 
originally intended to appeal the suspension but later decided against 
doing so.[27] In a start against the Toronto Blue Jays on July 14, Jiménez 
struggled with his command and had his shortest outing on the season, being 
pulled after 2 1/3 innings,[28] and matched a career-high 8 earned runs. 
In his previous 7 games his ERA was 2.14 but after the loss,[29] his record 
fell to 8–8 and ERA rose to 5.09. Jiménez finished with a career worst 
17 losses while winning 9 games for the Indians. He also led the league 
in wild pitches with 16. Jiménez rebounded in 2013, finishing with a record 
of 13–9 in 32 starts for the Indians. He also dropped his ERA to 3.30, 
2 runs lower from the previous season. Jiménez elected to opt out of the 
final year of his contract with the Indians and became a free agent on 
November 1, 2013. On February 19, 2014, Jiménez signed a 4-year $50 million 
deal with the Baltimore Orioles.[30][31][32] In his first start with the 
Orioles, Jimenez threw six innings against the Red Sox, getting tagged 
for four runs and a loss. He would go on to lose his next three decisions, 
as the Orioles lost in his first five starts. He pitched to a 6.59 ERA 
and went 0-4 in his first month with the O's. His first win as a member 
of the Orioles came on May 2, when he tossed 7 1⁄3 scoreless innings against 
the Twins. On July 11, 2014, Jimenez was placed on the 15-day DL due to 
a right ankle sprain. In his first season with Baltimore, Jimenez was 6–9 
with a 4.81 ERA in 25 games (22 starts). He was included on the teams ALDS 
roster, but did not pitch in the series. Despite being on the ALDS roster, 
Jimenez was left off of the O's ALCS roster against the Kansas City Royals. 
On April 11, 2015, in his first start of the season, Jimenez pitched 7 
shutout innings, against the Toronto Blue Jays. He allowed only two base 
runners, a single by José Reyes in the 4th, and a walk to him in 6th, and 
struck out 8. On April 17, 2015, in a start against the Boston Red Sox, 
Jiménez was ejected for the first time in his career by home plate umpire 
Jordan Baker. Jiménez had hit Pablo Sandoval in the right shoulder. Baker 
deemed the hit by pitch intentional, after Sandoval had slid into second 
baseman Jonathan Schoop, to break up a double play.[33] After starting 
the first half of the season going 7-4 with a 2.81 ERA in 17 starts, Jimenez 
had a disappointing second half, as he pitched to a 5.63 ERA with a 5-6 
record after the All-Star break. He finished the 2015 season with a moderate 
4.11 ERA in 32 starts. He went 12-10 with a 1.32 WHIP and 168 strikeouts 
in 184 innings pitched. On September 5, Jimenez pitched his first complete 
game since 2011. After allowing a 3-run home run in the first inning to 
the Rays, Jimenez retired 25 of the final 26 batters he faced, including 
the final 17 batters of the game. It was also the Orioles' first complete 
game since September 3 of 2014. In his very next start, Jimenez lowered 
his ERA to below six for the first time since May 17. He pitched seven 
innings of 2-run ball, earning his fourth straight quality start, and fifth 
straight start allowing three or fewer runs. In the Wild Card game, Jimenez 
entered the game in the bottom of the 11th inning with 1 out and no one 
on base. He proceeded to give up 3 straight hits, the last of which was 
a game ending walk-off home run to Edwin Encarnación, ending the Orioles 
season. Jiménez's four-seam fastball is frequently clocked as high as 96 mph, 
although recently, his average four-seam fastball will typically register 
between 90–93 mph. No one threw more pitches over 95 mph (1,342) than did 
Jiménez during the 2008 season.[34] Jiménez's two-seam fastball exhibits 
strong "tailing" action (moving inside on a right-handed batter and away 
from a left-handed batter), as well as good "sinking" action, though not 
always by design. Velocity ranges from 89–93 mph, though sometimes reaching 
94–96 mph. In 2008, Jiménez posted a very robust ground-ball percentage 
of 54.4%,[35] a testament to this pitch's effectiveness and making him 
an ideal pitcher for Coors Field, a ballpark known for extra-base hits. 
Jiménez is known to throw a split-finger fastball and an occasional forkball, 
having deceptive downward movement in the 85–88 mph range. The changeup 
thrown by Jiménez also exhibits strong "sinking" action, so much so that 
television commentators unfamiliar with Jiménez often have trouble distinguishing 
his change-up from a sinking fastball or a split-finger fastball. Jiménez 
varies the pitch by using both a circle changeup and traditional straight 
changeup grip. Typically thrown between 85–90 mph, the pitch will dive 
down and away from left-handed batters. Jiménez's slider is usually thrown 
between 83–85 mph. This pitch fools batters with an unusually sharp, late 
break and is used second most in frequency behind his four-seam fastball. 
Batters often confuse this pitch with a fastball (the major league average 
for a fastball is approximately 91 mph)[36] and due to the tight, late-breaking 
movement of the pitch, are often unable to hit it. The final pitch in Jiménez's 
arsenal is a looping curveball. Used infrequently, it is thrown anywhere
