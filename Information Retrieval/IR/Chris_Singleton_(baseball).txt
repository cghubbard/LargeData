Christopher Verdell Singleton (born August 15, 1972) is an American former 
center fielder in Major League Baseball. During his six-year major league 
career (from 1999 to 2005), he played for the Chicago White Sox (1999-2001), 
Baltimore Orioles (2002), Oakland Athletics (2003) and Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays (2005). During his playing career, his listed height and weight were 
6'2", 210 pounds. He batted and threw left-handed. Selected by the Houston 
Astros in the 30th round (790th overall) of the 1990 Major League Baseball 
Draft, Singleton opted to attend the University of Nevada. His stock rose 
considerably over the next three years, and he was selected by the San 
Francisco Giants in the 2nd round (48th overall) of the 1993 Major League 
Baseball Draft. On November 11, 1997, he was traded by the Giants with 
pitcher Alberto Castillo to the New York Yankees for Charlie Hayes and 
cash. On December 8, 1998, the Yankees dealt him to the White Sox for minor 
leaguer Rich Pratt. Upon reaching the majors in 1999, Singleton hit .300 
with 17 home runs and 74 RBI, but his power numbers dropped precipitously 
each season thereafter. A highlight of his 1999 season was on July 6, when 
he hit for the cycle becoming the first White Sox player to hit for the 
cycle in 15 years. On January 29, 2002, he was traded by the White Sox 
to the Baltimore Orioles for Willie Harris. Singleton had signed to play 
with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2004, but his contract was voided after 
he failed a physical exam. The team cited a pre-existing ear condition, 
which had initially been diagnosed as a simple infection, but ultimately 
proved to be something more serious.[1] On January 21, 2005, he signed 
with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, but was released on July 4 after just 59 
at-bats. Singleton trained at EVO Ultrafit in Phoenix, AZ throughout his 
career. [2] Paired with play-by-play man and former major league pitcher 
Ed Farmer, Singleton was the color commentator on Chicago White Sox radio 
broadcasts for the 2006 and 2007 seasons. However, on March 4, 2008, it 
was announced that he would be leaving that position to take on an analyst 
role with the ESPN television program Baseball Tonight. He was replaced 
by former Chicago Cubs television broadcaster Steve Stone. Singleton also 
became the lead game analyst for ESPN Radio's baseball coverage in 2011, 
teaming with play-by-play announcer Jon Sciambi to call Sunday Night Baseball
