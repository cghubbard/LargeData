Lakewood Township is a township in Ocean County, New Jersey, United States. 
As of the 2010 United States Census the township had a total population 
of 92,843,[9][10][11] representing an increase of 32,491 (+53.8%) from 
the 60,352 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 15,304 
(+34.0%) from the 45,048 counted in the 1990 Census.[19] The township ranked 
as the seventh-most-populous municipality in the state in 2010 after having 
been ranked 22nd in 2000.[20] The sharp increase in population from 2000 
to 2010 was led by increases in the township's Orthodox Jewish and Latino 
communities.[21][22] Lakewood is one of the hubs of Orthodox Judaism and 
is home to one of the largest yeshivas in the world, Beth Medrash Govoha, 
which was founded by Rabbi Aharon Kotler. The large Orthodox population, 
which comprises more than half the township's population, wields considerable 
political clout in the Township as a voting bloc.[23][24][25] The earliest 
documented European settlement of the present Lakewood area was by operators 
of sawmills, from about 1750 forward. One such sawmill, located at the 
east end of the present Lake Carasaljo, was known as Three Partners Mill 
from at least 1789 until at least 1814. From 1815 until 1818, in the same 
area, Jesse Richards had an iron-smelting operation known as Washington 
Furnace, using the local bog iron ore. The ironworks were revived in 1833 
by Joseph W. Brick, who named the business Bergen Iron Works, which also 
became the name of the accompanying town. In 1865, the town was renamed 
Bricksburg in 1865, and in 1880 it was renamed Lakewood and became a fashionable 
winter resort. Lakewood's developers thought that "Bricksburg" didn't capture 
their vision for the community, and the names "Brightwood" and "Lakewood" 
were proposed. After reaching out to area residents, "Lakewood" was chosen 
and the United States Postal Service approved the name in March 1880.[26] 
The name "Lakewood" was intended to focus on the location near lakes and 
pine forests.[27] Lakewood was incorporated as a township by an act of 
the New Jersey Legislature on March 23, 1892, from portions of Brick Township. 
Portions of Howell Township in Monmouth County were annexed to Lakewood 
Township in 1929.[28] Lakewood's three greatest hotels were the Laurel 
House (opened in 1880; closed in 1932), the Lakewood Hotel (opened January 
1891, closed in 1925), and the Laurel-in-the-Pines (opened December 1891, 
burned down in 1967).[29] Lakewood's promoters claimed that its winter 
temperature was usually about ten degrees warmer than that of New York 
City and were warmer than points located further south,[30][31] but this 
claim is not substantiated by official records of the United States Weather 
Bureau.[32] During the 1890s, Lakewood was a resort for the rich and famous, 
and The New York Times devoted a weekly column to the activities of Lakewood 
society.[33] Grover Cleveland spent the winters of 1891-92 and 1892-93 
in a cottage near the Lakewood Hotel, commuting to his business in New 
York City.[34] Mark Twain also enjoyed vacationing in Lakewood. George 
Jay Gould I acquired an estate at Lakewood in 1896, which is now Georgian 
Court University.[35] John D. Rockefeller bought a property in 1902 which 
later became Ocean County Park.[36] Lakewood's hotel business remained 
strong in the 1920s and 1950s, but went into severe decline in the 1960s.[37] 
In the 1960s, much of the woods and cranberry bogs in the township were 
replaced by large housing developments. Leisure Village, a condominium 
retirement development on the south side of Route 70, opened for sale in 
1963.[38] According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has 
a total area of 24.982 square miles (64.703 km2), including 24.577 square 
miles (63.653 km2) of land and 0.405 square miles (1.050 km2) of water 
(1.62%).[1][2] Lakewood is a fairly flat place, being as it is on the Coastal 
Plain; three-quarters of its area is between 20–80 feet above sea level, 
and its highest point is about 150 feet.[39] The North Branch of the Metedeconk 
River forms the northern boundary and part of the eastern boundary of the 
township, while the South Branch runs through the township. A southern 
portion of the township is drained by the north branch of Kettle Creek. 
The township has four man-made lakes; three of them - Lake Carasaljo, Manetta, 
and Shenandoah - are on the South Branch of the Metedeconk River, whereas 
the fourth - Lake Waddill - is on Kettle Creek. Lakewood CDP (2010 Census 
population of 53,805[40]), Leisure Village (4,400 as of 2010[41]) and Leisure 
Village East (4,217 as of 2010[42]) are unincorporated communities and 
census-designated places (CDPs) located within Lakewood Township.[43][44][45] 
Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially 
or completely within the township include Greenville, Lake Carasaljo, Seven 
Stars and South Lakewood.[46] The township borders the municipalities of 
Brick Township, Jackson Township and Toms River Township in Ocean County; 
and Howell Township in Monmouth County.[47] Portions of Lakewood Township 
are part of an Urban Enterprise Zone. In addition to other benefits to 
encourage employment within the Zone, shoppers can take advantage of a 
reduced 3½% sales tax rate (versus the 7% rate charged statewide) at eligible 
merchants.[48] The Strand, a local theater established in 1922, was designed 
by architect Thomas W. Lamb.[49] FirstEnergy Park, home of the Lakewood 
BlueClaws, is a 6,588-seat stadium constructed at a cost of $22 million 
through funds raised from the township's Urban Enterprise Zone.[50] The 
Lakewood BlueClaws of the South Atlantic League, the Single-A minor league 
baseball affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies, play at FirstEnergy Park. 
The BlueClaws have led the league in attendance every year since its formation 
in 2001, with more than 380,000 fans in the 2001 season, representing an 
average attendance of more than 6,200 fans per game.[51] Sister Mary Grace

of Jewish people in Lakewood is one of the highest for incorporated areas 
in the U.S., at an estimated 59%.[62] At the 2010 United States Census,

government. The five-member Township Committee is elected directly by the 
voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office 
on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election 
each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle.[7][65] 
At an annual reorganization meeting, the Township Committee selects one 
of its members to serve as Mayor and another as Deputy Mayor. The Township 
Committee controls all legislative powers of the Township except for health 
matters, which are controlled by the Board of Health. In addition, the 
Committee appoints members to boards, commissions, and committees. Each 
member of the township committee serves as a liaison to different divisions, 
departments, and committees. The mayor, elected from among members of the 
committee, presides at meetings and performs other duties as the Township 
Committee may prescribe. The mayor has the power to appoint subcommittees 
with the consent of the committee. When authorized, he or she may execute 
documents on behalf of the township, makes proclamations concerning holidays 
and events of interest, and exercises ceremonial power of the Township 
and other powers conferred upon him by law. As of 2016[update], the members 
of the Lakewood Township Committee are Mayor Menashe Miller (R, term on 
committee ends December 31, 2018; term as mayor ends 2016), Deputy mayor 
Albert Akerman (R, term on committee and as deputy mayor ends 2016), Raymond 
Coles (D, 2017), Michael J. D'elia (R, 2017) and Meir Lichtenstein (D, 
2018).[3][66][67][68][69][70][71] Miller also receives a salary from the 
New Jersey General Assembly where he works as a legislative aide.[72] Coles 
serves as Treasurer of the Lakewood Municipal Utilities Authority.[73][74] 
Lakewood Township is served by the Lakewood Police Department (LPD), which 
provides police protection for the township and has several specialized 
units. The specialized units include: Traffic and Safety, School Resource 
Officers, Special Response Team (SWAT), Dive Team, and a Motorcycle Patrol 
and Bicycle Patrol unit in the spring and summer. The current Chief of 
Police is Greg Meyers.[75] Lakewood Township is served by the Lakewood 
Fire Department (LFD), a unified combination consisting of five volunteer 
fire companies; one fire police unit; and two paid fire stations which 
provide fire protection for the township.[76] The fire department was founded 
in October 1888. The Board of Fire Commissioners was created in 1896. The 
first motorized equipment was purchased in 1915. The largest fire in township 
history occurred on April 20, 1940, when a forest fire destroyed over 50 
structures and burned down most of the southern half of town. The largest 
loss of life caused by fire occurred on February 12, 1936 when the Victoria 
Mansion Hotel (valued at $100,000) located on the southeast corner of Lexington 
Avenue and Seventh Street, was destroyed in a fire and 16 people died.[77] 
The largest structure fire in department history occurred on March 29, 
1967, when the block-long Laurel in the Pines Hotel was leveled by a suspicious 
fire that also killed three people. The last fire hose was picked up a 
week later when the fire was finally declared out.[78] There are approximately 
75 volunteer firefighters which has led to an increase in paid firefighters. 
It has been speculated that with the dwindling number of volunteers the 
paid portion of the department will increase and volunteer fire companies 
will either be condensed or eliminated altogether in the coming years.[citation

Lakewood Township is served by three emergency medical services (EMS) entities, 
which include Lakewood EMS (LEMS), Lakewood First Aid & Emergency Squad 
(LFAS) and Hatzolah EMS. The squads are all independently operated but 
nevertheless work together to provide emergency medical services for the 
township. Lakewood First Aid & Emergency Squad and Hatzolah EMS are volunteer 
organizations, while Lakewood EMS is a paid municipal service. In the event 
of a motor vehicle accident, Lakewood First Aid & Emergency Squad are the 
primary providers of vehicle extrication services for the township and 
Hatzolah EMS serves as backup.[80] The three organizations collectively 
have approximately 150 volunteer and paid EMTs. Hatzolah also has a Paramedic 
unit by special arrangement with Monmouth Ocean Hospital Service Corporation 
(MONOC). Lakewood Township is located in the 4th Congressional District[82]
