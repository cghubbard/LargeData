Jerome Michael "Jerry" Trupiano (born in St. Louis, Missouri) is an American 
radio sportscaster, best known for his former role as a play-by-play announcer 
for the Boston Red Sox. Trupiano is a graduate of Saint Louis University 
where he began his broadcasting career as a disc jockey on the college 
radio station. Trupiano hosted a talk show for fourteen years in Houston 
and called games for MLB's Houston Astros (1985-86), the Montreal Expos 
(1989-90), the World Hockey Association's Houston Aeros (1974-78), the 
National Basketball Association's Houston Rockets (1978-80), the National 
Football League's Houston Oilers (1980-89), Southwest Conference Football 
(1978-88), World League of American Football games for TSN (1992) and called 
games on the CBS Radio Game of the Week in 1991 before joining Joe Castiglione 
in the Red Sox' radio booth in 1993.[1][2] Trupiano called the Red Sox' 
2004 World Series-winning game at Busch Stadium. Interestingly, the Red 
Sox radio team was forced to an auxiliary press box due to all of the media 
coverage and Trupiano called the game from the booth he had used for practice 
broadcasts decades earlier.[3] On September 27, 2006, the Boston Herald 
reported that Trupiano's contract would not be renewed [4] and noted that 
Trupiano might end up with the St. Louis Cardinals. Trupiano denied that 
any talks with the Cardinals had taken place.[5] On May 16, 2007, Trupiano 
was joined by his son Brian to call a game between the Brockton Rox and 
the Oil Can Boyd's Traveling All-Stars. The All-Star team features retired 
major league players Dennis 'Oil Can' Boyd, Bill Lee, Marquis Grissom, 
Delino DeShields and Ken Ryan. The game was broadcast on a taped delay 
by two local Public-access television cable TV stations.[6] Trupiano also 
worked as on Westwood One's broadcasts of the NCAA Men's College World 
Series finals in 2007 and 2008. In August 2009, Trupiano returned to the 
air on a regular weekend sports call-in show on 98.5 The Sports Hub Radio 
(WBZ-FM) in Boston. Trupiano is also the main sports anchor for Lexy.com, 
an audio social media startup in San Francisco. His responsibilities include 
coverage of the major college and sports leagues, as well as his own commentary 
feeds such as "View From the Booth" and "Dugout Daily." In 2010 Trupiano 
signed on with Fox Sports to become the play-by-play voice of the Ivy League 
on Fox College Sports. He is also an instructor at Young Broadcasters of 
America in Natick, Massachusetts. Trupiano lives in Franklin, Massachusetts, 
with his wife, Donna, and two children. In 2006, his son Brian played for 
the Brockton Rox, part of the Canadian-American Association of Professional
