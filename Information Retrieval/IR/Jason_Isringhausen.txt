Jason Derik Isringhausen (/ˈɪzrɪŋhaʊzɪn/ born September 7, 1972) is an 
American former professional baseball pitcher and coach. He pitched in 
Major League Baseball from 1995 through 2012 for the New York Mets, Oakland 
Athletics, St. Louis Cardinals, Tampa Bay Rays, and Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim. Isringhausen was, with Bill Pulsipher and Paul Wilson, a member 
of "Generation K", a group of highly regarded Mets prospects. Isringhausen 
proceeded to have a successful career as a relief pitcher, recording exactly 
300 career saves. He was a two-time All-Star and led the National League 
in saves in 2004. Isringhausen was chosen as a draft-and-follow prospect 
by the New York Mets in the 44th round of the 1991 Major League Baseball 
draft. He signed in May 1992. In the mid-1990s, Isringhausen, along with 
pitchers Bill Pulsipher and Paul Wilson were all widely hyped as the next 
generation of New York Mets' superstars, despite all being in the minor 
leagues. The group received considerable press attention and the nickname 
"Generation K". However, injuries took their toll and 1995 was the first 
year that all three started the season healthy. Isringhausen began his 
career as a starter for the Mets near the end of the season, posting a 
9–2 record in 14 starts. But a steady progression of serious injuries, 
including tuberculosis, a broken wrist (sustained while punching a dugout 
trash can) and three major operations on his pitching arm, derailed his 
progression into a major-league rotation. Consequently, he was forced to 
miss most of the 1997 season, as well as the entire 1998 season. When he 
was finally healthy in 1999, he was moved to the bullpen after only five 
starts. After inconsistent play with the Mets, he was traded to the Oakland 
Athletics at the trading deadline for reliever Billy Taylor. Mets manager 
Bobby Valentine was reluctant to use Isringhausen in relief, saying that 
it would be akin to "[using] an Indy car as a taxi."[1] As a relief pitcher 
and closer for the Athletics, Isringhausen's performance improved. Isringhausen 
established himself as a top closer with Oakland, as the A's made the playoffs 
in 2000 and 2001. Isringhausen earned his first selection to the All-Star 
game in 2000. Isringhausen signed with the Cardinals as a free agent before 
the 2002 season. During Isringhausen's time with the team, the Cardinals 
won the Central Division in 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2006 with World Series 
appearances in 2004 and 2006, winning the World Series in 2006. He registered 
a league-leading 47 saves in 2004, tying the franchise record which Lee 
Smith set, until Trevor Rosenthal broke the record in 2015.[2] He was an 
All-Star and posted a 2.14 earned run average (ERA) with 39 saves in 2005 
as the Cardinals won 100 games. The saves total was fifth in the NL. Despite 
this success, Isringhausen's 2006 season began with two losses and a blown 
save in his first five appearances. He struggled with control problems 
throughout the season, leading to 38 walks (the most given up by Isringhausen 
in a season since he became a closer) and a 3.55 ERA, which was his highest 
ERA as a closer since the 2000 season, in which his ERA was 3.78. Isringhausen 
finished the season with a 4–8 record and 33 saves along with 10 blown 
saves. He missed the entire 2006 playoffs due to a hip injury, allowing 
rookie Adam Wainwright to become the Cardinals' closer for the playoffs 
and that team's World Series Championship. During the 2006 off-season, 
Isringhausen underwent his second hip surgery in two years. With Wainwright 
slotted into the rotation, Isringhausen was returned to the closer role 
to begin 2007. Isringhausen responded by notching career numbers in 2007, 
posting a 4–0 record, 2.48 ERA, and 32 saves while walking 28, striking 
out 54, and giving up only four home runs in 63 1⁄3 innings pitched, appearing 
in 63 games. Batters hit .179 against him. On September 25, 2007, Isringhausen 
was named as one of 10 finalists for the "DHL Presents the Major League 
Baseball Delivery Man of the Year Award"; and on October 5, 2007 it was 
announced the St. Louis Cardinals had picked up Isringhausen's option for 
the 2008 season. On May 10, 2008, manager Tony La Russa removed Isringhausen 
as the club's closer. On July 29, 2008, La Russa announced that Isringhausen 
had resumed his role as closer. On August 19, 2008, Isringhausen left the 
team due to lingering elbow tendinitis and a torn tendon.[3] On February 
20, 2009, Isringhausen signed a minor league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays 
with an invitation to spring training.[4] On April 1, 2009, Isringhausen 
was added to the 40-man roster of the Rays, and began the season on the 
disabled list.[5][6] Once activated, Jason pitched in nine games before 
it was announced on June 13 that he tore a ligament in the surgically repaired 
right elbow and would miss the rest of the season to undergo Tommy John 
surgery.[7] On July 20, 2010, Isringhausen pitched a bullpen session for 
the Cincinnati Reds. He impressed both pitching coach Bryan Price and former 
Cardinals and current Reds General Manager Walt Jocketty enough that the 
Reds prepared a contract offer for Isringhausen.[8] On July 22, 2010, Isringhausen 
agreed to terms with a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds.[9] 
Isringhausen signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring 
training for the 2011 season.[10] He began the season in extended spring 
training, but was promoted to the Mets on April 10.[11] He had a good outing 
in his first game, against the Colorado Rockies. He was called in with 
1 out in the bottom of the eight and retired both batters he faced. His 
return also marked him as the only pitcher in major league history to return 
to the mound following a third Tommy John operation.[12] He was being used 
as the 8th inning setup pitcher for the Mets until previous closer Francisco 
Rodriguez was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers. Isringhausen was then moved 
to the closer's role. On July 19, 2011, he picked up his first save since 
2008. On August 15, 2011, Isringhausen became the 23rd pitcher all time 
with 300 career saves against the San Diego Padres in a 5–4 Mets win. On 
February 22, 2012, he signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim. He eventually appeared in 50 games out of the bullpen 
for the Angels with a 4.14 ERA. On February 14, 2013, Isringhausen was 
named volunteer pitching coach at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville 
(SIUE) in Edwardsville, Illinois, where he resides during the offseason. 
While a member of the staff at SIUE, Isringhausen has denied through his 
agent he is retiring from Major League Baseball, and is still looking for
