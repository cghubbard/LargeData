Edward Victor Cicotte (/ˈsiːkɒt/;[1][2] June 19, 1884 – May 5, 1969), nicknamed 
"Knuckles", was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball 
best known for his time with the Chicago White Sox. He was one of eight 
players permanently ineligible for professional baseball for his alleged 
participation in the Black Sox scandal in the 1919 World Series, in which 
the favored White Sox lost to the Cincinnati Reds in eight games.[3] The 
"fixing" of the 1919 World Series is the only recognized gambling scandal 
to tarnish a World Series.[4] Cicotte was the son of Ambrose Cicotte (1843–1894) 
and Archange Mary Drouillard (1843–1909), both of mainly French-Canadian 
extraction. His father's early death is said to have pushed Cicotte to 
excel and be very protective of his family. He married Rose Ellen Freer 
(1885–1958), daughter of Russell John Freer (1852–1932) and Annie Cecile 
Thornton (1863–1928), both of whom would later live with the Cicottes. 
They had two daughters, Rose (born 1906) and Virginia (1916–1992), and 
one son, Edward Jr. (1919–1992). Cicotte was a starting pitcher and a knuckleball 
specialist who won 208 games and lost 149 over the course of a 14-year 
career pitching for the Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox, and Chicago White 
Sox. At the time of his lifetime ban, he was considered one of the premier 
pitchers in the American League. A Detroit native, Cicotte played baseball 
in Georgia in 1905, where he was a teammate of Ty Cobb. Both players were 
purchased by the Tigers, and Cicotte made his big-league debut on September 
3, 1905. Pitching in three games for Detroit, Cicotte compiled a 1–1 record 
with a 3.50 earned run average. Cicotte didn't return to the major leagues 
again until 1908, when he resurfaced with the Red Sox. After he compiled 
a 41–48 record in a Boston uniform, the Red Sox sold him to the White Sox 
on July 22, 1912. Cicotte celebrated a breakout year in 1913, going 18–12 
on the season with an ERA of 1.58. He led the league in winning percentage 
in 1916, but his best year was 1917, when he won 28 games and led the league 
in wins, ERA, and innings pitched. On April 14 he threw a no hitter against 
the St. Louis Browns. That year, the White Sox went to the World Series, 
defeating the New York Giants 4 games to 2. Cicotte won Game 1, lost Game 
3, and pitched six innings of relief in Game 5 for a no-decision. Injuries 
reduced Cicotte to a 12–19 record in 1918, but in 1919, he rebounded to 
win 29 games and once again led the league in wins, winning percentage, 
and innings pitched, as well as in complete games. His 1919 salary was 
$6,000, but he had a provision for a $10,000 bonus if he won 30 games. 
Legend has it that as the season drew to a close, owner Charles Comiskey 
ordered manager Kid Gleason to bench Cicotte for 5 games, denying him a 
chance at a 30-win season and the bonus money. The book Eight Men Out by 
Eliot Asinof and the movie based on the book does record that Cicotte, 
despite being grossly underpaid for a pitcher of his ability, resisted 
repeated attempts by Chick Gandil to get him to throw the series until 
just days before the World Series opened when it became clear that Comiskey 
would never pay him even part of the promised bonus. In the 1919 World 
Series against the Reds, Cicotte pitched in three games, winning one but 
pitching ineffectively and losing the other two. Cicotte was the first 
of the eight players to come forward, signing a confession and a waiver 
of immunity. He later recanted this confession and was acquitted of all 
charges at trial by jury. Despite this, Cicotte and his alleged co-conspirators 
were subsequently made permanently ineligible for baseball by Kenesaw Mountain 
Landis, Major League Baseball's new commissioner, recently hired to restore 
the integrity of the game in the wake of the 1919 scandal. After being 
banned from playing baseball, Cicotte returned to Livonia, Michigan. He 
managed a service station, served as a game warden in the Michigan Department 
of Natural Resources, then went to work for Ford Motor Company, where he 
retired in 1944. Cicotte lived to be 84 years old. He was a strawberry 
farmer on a 5.5-acre (2.2 ha) farm near Farmington until his death at Henry 
Ford Hospital in Detroit on May 5, 1969.[5] In the 1988 film Eight Men 
Out, about the Black Sox scandal, Cicotte is portrayed by actor David Strathairn. 
He was portrayed by actor Steve Eastin in the 1989 film Field of Dreams. 
Cicotte's grandnephew Al Cicotte (1929–1982) later pitched in the major 
leagues, compiling a lifetime 10–13 record with six teams between 1957
