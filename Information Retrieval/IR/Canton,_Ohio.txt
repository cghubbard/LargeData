Canton is a city in and the county seat of Stark County, Ohio, United States.[6] 
Founded in 1805 alongside the Middle and West Branches of Nimishillen Creek, 
Canton became a heavy manufacturing center because of its numerous railroad 
lines. However, its status in that regard began to decline during the late 
20th century, as shifts in the manufacturing industry led to the relocation 
or repositioning of many factories. After this decline, the city's industry 
diversified into the service economy, including retailing, education, finance 
and healthcare. Canton is located approximately 24 miles (39 km) south 
of Akron,[7] and 60 miles (97 km) south of Cleveland,[8] in the northeastern 
part of Ohio. Canton lies on the outskirts of the greater northeast Ohio 
metropolitan area anchored by Cleveland, and is also a short distance away 
from the periphery of the greater Pittsburgh area. The city lies on the 
edge of Ohio's extensive Amish country, particularly in Holmes and Wayne 
counties to the city's west and southwest. Canton is located along Interstate 
77, U.S. Route 62, and the historic Lincoln Highway, the present-day U.S. 
Route 30, and is also the terminus of the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad. 
As of the 2010 Census, the city of Canton is the largest incorporated area 
in the Canton-Massillon, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which 
includes all of Stark and Carroll counties. The CMMSA reported a population 
of 404,422. Canton's city population declined 9.7%, down to 73,007 residents.[9] 
Despite this decline, the 2010 figure actually moved Canton from ninth 
to eighth place among Ohio cities. Nearby Youngstown in Mahoning County, 
once considerably more populous than Canton, suffered a larger decline.[9] 
Canton is chiefly notable for two reasons: the first is football, especially 
the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the formation in 1920 of what eventually 
became the National Football League. The second is William McKinley, who 
conducted from his home in Canton the famed front porch campaign which 
won him the presidency of the United States in the 1896 election. The McKinley 
National Memorial and the William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum 
commemorate his life and presidency. Canton was chosen as the site of the 
First Ladies National Historic Site largely in honor of his wife, Ida Saxton 
McKinley. Canton was founded in 1805, incorporated as a village in 1822, 
and re-incorporated as a city in 1838.[10] Bezaleel Wells, the surveyor 
who divided the land of the town, named it after Canton (a traditional 
name for Guangzhou), China. The name was a memorial to a trader named John 
O'Donnell, whom Wells admired. O'Donnell had named his Maryland plantation 
after the Chinese city, as he had been the first person to transport goods 
from there to Baltimore. Canton was the adopted home of President William 
McKinley. Born in Niles, McKinley first practiced law in Canton around 
1867, and was prosecuting attorney of Stark County from 1869 to 1871. The 
city was his home during his successful campaign for Ohio governor, the 
site of his front-porch presidential campaign of 1896 and the campaign 
of 1900. Canton is now the site of the William McKinley Presidential Library 
and Museum and the McKinley National Memorial, dedicated in 1907. Canton's 
street layout forms the basis for the system of addresses in Stark County. 
Canton proper is divided into address quadrants (NW, NE, SW, SE) by Tuscarawas 
Street (dividing N and S) and Market Avenue (dividing E and W). Due to 
shifts in the street layout, the E-W divider becomes Cleveland Avenue south 
of the city, merging onto Ridge Road farther out. The directionals are 
noted as suffixes to the street name (e.g. Tuscarawas St W, 55th Street 
NE). Typically within the city numbered streets run east and west and radiate 
from the Tuscarawas Street baseline, while named avenues run north and 
south. This system extends into Stark County but is not shared by the cities 
of Massillon, Louisville, East Canton or North Canton, which have their 
own internal address grids. Canton is located at an elevation of 1060 feet 
(323 m).[11] Nimishillen Creek and its East, Middle and West Branches flow 
through the city.[12] Canton is bordered by Plain Township and North Canton 
to the north, Meyers Lake and Perry Township to the west, Canton Township 
to the South, and Nimishillen Township, Osnaburg Township and East Canton 
to the east. Annexations were approved in December 2006 extending Canton's 
eastern boundary to East Canton's border.[13][14] According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 25.48 square miles (65.99 km2), 
of which, 25.46 square miles (65.94 km2) is land and 0.02 square miles 
(0.05 km2) is water.[2] Canton has a humid continental climate (Köppen 
climate classification Dfa), typical of much of the Midwestern United States, 
with very warm, humid summers and cold winters. Winters tend to be cold, 
with average January high temperatures of 33 °F (1 °C), and average lows 
of 19 °F (−7 °C), with considerable variation in temperatures. During a 
typical January, high temperatures of over 50 °F (10 °C) are just as common 
as low temperatures of below 0 °F (−18 °C). Snowfall is lighter than the 
snow belt areas to the north. Akron-Canton Airport generally averages 47.1 
inches (120 cm) of snow per season. Springs are short with rapid transition 
from hard winter to summer weather. Summers tend to be warm, sometimes 
hot, with average July high temperatures of 82 °F (28 °C), and average 
July low of 62 °F (17 °C). Summer weather is more stable, generally humid 
with thunderstorms fairly common. Temperatures reach or exceed 90 °F (32 °C) 
about 9 times each summer, on average.[15] Fall usually is the driest season 
with many clear, warm days and cool nights. The all-time record high in 
the Akron-Canton area of 104 °F (40 °C) was established on August 6, 1918, 
and the all-time record low of −25 °F (−32 °C) was set on January 19, 1994.[16]

with significant health care and agricultural segments. The city is home 
to the TimkenSteel Corporation, a major manufacturer of specialty steel. 
Several other large companies operate in the greater-Canton area, including 
Timken Company a maker of tapered roller bearings; Belden Brick Company, 
a brick and masonry producer; Diebold, a maker of ATMs, electronic voting 
devices, and bank vaults, and Medline Industries, a manufacturer and distributor 
of health care supplies. The area is also home to several regional food 
producers, including Nickles Bakery (baked goods), Case Farms (poultry), 
and Shearer's Foods (snack foods). Poultry production and dairy farming 
are also important segments of the Canton area's economy. In recent years, 
Canton has experienced a very low unemployment rate.[29] The healthcare 
sector is particularly strong, with Aultman Hospital and Mercy Medical 
Center among its largest employers. Nevertheless, as in many industrial 
areas of the United States, employment in the manufacturing sector is in 
a state of decline. LTV Steel (formerly Republic Steel) suffered bankruptcy 
in 2000. Republic Steel emerged and continues to maintain operations in 
the Canton. On June 30, 2014, the Timken Company and TimkenSteel split, 
forming two separate companies at the urging of shareholders.[30] The Timken 
Company relocated to neighboring Jackson Township, while TimkenSteel remains 
headquartered in the Canton. In response to this changing manufacturing 
landscape, the city is undergoing a transition to a retail and service-based 
economy. Beginning in the 1970s, Canton, like many mid-size American cities, 
lost most of its downtown retail business to the suburbs. The majority 
of the Canton area's "box store" retail is located in the general vicinity 
of the Belden Village Mall in Jackson Township. However, in recent years, 
the downtown area has seen significant rejuvenation, with cafes, restaurants, 
and the establishment of an arts district. A few retail centers remain 
in Canton at or near the city limits. Tuscarawas Street (Lincoln Way), 
a leg of the Lincoln Highway connecting Canton with nearby Massillon, is 
home to the Canton Centre Mall and several retail outlets of varying size. 
A vein of commerce runs along Whipple Avenue, connecting the Canton Centre 
area with the Belden Village area. A similar vein runs north from the downtown 
area, along Cleveland and Market avenues. Connecting Cleveland and Market 
avenues is a small shopping district on 30th Street NW, and retail lines 
the Route 62 corridor leading from Canton to Louisville and Alliance. In 
recent years, Canton has come to experience a renaissance. At the heart 
of this transformation is the Pro Football Hall of Fame, with its multimillion-dollar 
"Hall of Fame Village" expansion project.[31] This project has been complemented 
with significant investments by city leaders in urban redevelopment, which 
began with the successful Onesto Hotel Project.[32] Other urban renewal 
plans are underway, which include the redevelopment of the downtown Market 
Square area.[33] Private investment has furthered Canton's transformation, 
which is illustrated by the multimillion-dollar creation of the Gervasi 
Vineyard, which draws patrons throughout the region.[34] According to Canton's 
2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[35] the top employers in the 
city are: The Canton Museum of Art, founded in 1935, is a broad-based community 
arts organization designed to encourage and promote the fine arts in Canton. 
The museum focuses on 19th and 20th Century American artists, specifically 
works on paper, and on American ceramics, beginning in the 1950s. The museum 
sponsors annual shows of work of high school students in Canton and Stark 
County, and financial scholarships are awarded. Educational Outreach programs 
take the museum off-site to libraries, parochial schools, area public schools, 
five inner city schools and a school for students with behavioral disorders. 
The city's Arts District, located downtown, is the site of monthly First 
Friday arts celebrations. Canton's K-12 students are primarily served by 
the Canton City School District, although students north of 17th Street 
NW have an overlap with Plain Local School District. Canton Local School 
District serves the better part of Canton South. Malone University, a private, 
four-year liberal arts college affiliated with the Evangelical Friends 
Church, is located on 25th Street NW. Catholic-run Walsh University is 
located nearby in North Canton. Stark State College and a branch of Kent 
State University are also nearby, in Jackson Township. Also, in downtown 
Canton, there is a small annex for Stark State College to be used by the 
Early College High School students who are located on the Timken Campus. 
The city is also served by two Catholic high schools: St. Thomas Aquinas 
High School and Central Catholic High School (located in Perry Township). 
Perry Township is also home to Perry High School which serves students 
from both the Massillon and Canton area. Catholic grade schools within 
the city limits of Canton are St. Peter, St. Joseph, and Our Lady of Peace. 
Additional Catholic schools in the Canton area include Canton St. Michael 
School, ranked first in the Power of the Pen state tournament in 2010, 
and Canton St. Joan of Arc School. There is also Heritage Christian School 
(K-12), a Christian grade school and high school. Canton Country Day School 
is a private PreK-8 school located just outside city limits in nearby Plain 
Township. Within the city limits is the private Canton Montessori School, 
which teaches according to the Montessori Plan for education proposed by 
Maria Montessori in the early 20th century. Canton is served in print by 
The Repository, the city's only newspaper. Canton is part of the greater 
Cleveland radio and television media market. However, due to its proximity 
to Youngstown, it is common for residents to receive stations from that 
area. There are also three television stations that are licensed to Canton, 
though none of them are major network affiliates. Canton also has a cable 
Public-access television channel, Canton City Schools TV 11. The content 
varies based on the viewer's location. Citizens located in North Canton 
will see North Canton's programming instead of Canton City's. Those within 
the borders of Plain Local Schools will see Eagle Television's programming. 
Canton is home to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The American Professional 
Football Association, the forerunner of the NFL, was founded in a Canton 
car dealership on September 17, 1920. Every summer, Canton is the home 
of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement Festival, which includes 
a hot air balloon festival, ribs burn-off, fashion show, community parade, 
Sunday morning race, enshrinee dinner, and the Pro Football Hall of Fame 
Grand Parade. The festival culminates in the enshrinement of the new inductees 
and the NFL/Hall of Fame Game, a pre-season exhibition between teams representing 
the AFC and NFC at Tom Benson Stadium.[36] Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, 
used during the regular season by Canton McKinley High School (as well 
as some other area schools and colleges) has been recognized by The Sporting 
News. The Canton Bulldogs were an NFL football team that played from 1920–1923 
skipped 1924 season then played 1925 to '26 before folding. Three of the 
Ohio High School Athletic Association state final football games are hosted 
in Canton at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium. The other three take place 
in nearby Massillon, Ohio, at Paul Brown Tiger Stadium. The Canton Legends 
played in the American Indoor Football Association at the Canton Civic 
Center. Operations were suspended in 2009. The Continental Indoor Football 
League also has offices in Canton. The first official female bodybuilding 
competition was held in Canton in November 1977 and was called the Ohio 
Regional Women's Physique Championship.[37] Canton is also home to an NBA 
D-League team, the Canton Charge, which started play with the 2011–2012 
season. The Cleveland Cavaliers have full control over the team. The Charge 
play their home games at the Canton Memorial Civic Center. The Canton Invaders 
of the National Professional Soccer League II and American Indoor Soccer 
Association played home games at the Canton Memorial Civic Center from 
1984 until 1996, winning five league championships. In 2009, the Ohio Vortex 
became an expansion team in the Professional Arena Soccer League. Operations 
have since been suspended. Canton has been home to professional baseball 
on several occasions. A number of minor league teams called Canton home 
in the early 1900s, including the Canton Terriers in the 1920s and '30s. 
The Canton–Akron Indians were the AA affiliate of the major league Cleveland 
Indians for nine years, playing at Thurman Munson Memorial Stadium until 
the team relocated north to Akron following the 1996 season. Two independent 
minor league teams, the Canton Crocodiles and the Canton Coyotes, both 
members of the Frontier League, called Munson Stadium home for several 
years afterward. The Crocodiles, who won the league championship in their 
inaugural season in 1997, moved to Washington, Pennsylvania, in 2002, and 
the Coyotes moved to Columbia, Missouri, in 2003, after just one season 
in Canton. Canton is connected to the Interstate Highway System via Interstate 
77 which connects Canton to Charleston, West Virginia, and points south, 
and to Cleveland and Akron, Ohio, to the north. U.S. Route 30 connects 
Canton to Fort Wayne, Indiana, and points west, and to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 
and points east. U.S. Route 62 connects Canton to Columbus, Ohio, and points 
southwest, and to Youngstown, Ohio, and points northeast. The city has 
several arterial roads. Ohio 43 (Market Avenue, Walnut Avenue and Cherry

is a commercial Class C airport located 10 miles (16 km) north of the city 
and provides daily commercial passenger and air freight service. Stark 
Area Regional Transit Authority (SARTA) provides public transit bus service 
within the county, including service to Massillon, the Akron-Canton Regional 
Airport, and the Amtrak station located in Alliance. On the July 21, 2008, 
Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report made a comment about John McCain 
making a campaign stop in Canton, Ohio, and "not the crappy Canton in Georgia."[38] 
The comment resulted in a local uproar, with the Canton, Georgia, mayor 
insisting Colbert had never visited the town along with an invitation for 
him to do so.[38] On July 30, 2008, Colbert apologized for the story, insisting 
that he was incorrect and that the "real" crappy Canton was Canton, Kansas, 
after which he made several jokes at the Kansas town's expense.[39][40] 
On August 5, Colbert apologized to citizens of Canton, Georgia and Canton, 
Kansas, then directing his derision on Canton, South Dakota. Colbert later 
went on to offer a half-hearted apology to Canton, South Dakota before 
proceeding to mock Canton, Texas. On October 28, Colbert turned his attention 
back to Canton, Ohio after Barack Obama made a campaign stop there, forcing 
Colbert to find it "crappy." In 2009, the city was mistakenly listed on 
Google's map service as "Colesville".[41] A rumor that the mistake was 
the result of a prank by rival football fans was denied by Google spokeswoman 
Elaine Filadelfo.[42] It was also featured on the Star Trek: Voyager Star 
Trek: Voyager episode, 11:59 (Star Trek: Voyager), as an alternative location 
for the Millennium Gate, a futuristic biosphere, because the town where 
it was supposed to be built, contained a Henry Janeway (an ancestor of
