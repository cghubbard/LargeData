The Charleston RiverDogs are a minor league baseball team based in Charleston, 
South Carolina. The team plays in the Class Single-A South Atlantic League 
and are an affiliate of the New York Yankees. Their home stadium is at 
Joseph P. Riley, Jr. Park. The majority owner is Marvin Goldklang who also 
owns a stake in five other minor league baseball teams throughout the country 
(Fort Myers Miracle, Hudson Valley Renegades, and St. Paul Saints). The 
name originates from an urban legend that sailors in Charleston would notice 
large rats on the banks of the nearby Cooper and Ashley rivers, and would 
call them "river dogs", and was chosen in a name-the-team contest held 
at local Piggly Wiggly outlets in 1994.[1] The RiverDogs were founded in 
1980 as the Charleston Royals, and were a farm team of the Kansas City 
Royals. In their first season as the Royals they won the South Atlantic 
League's Southern Division championship, but fell in the playoffs against 
Greensboro. Like the Pirates, the Royals were known for their pitching, 
because in 1981 pitcher Jeffery Gladden led the league with a 2.09 ERA. 
In 1982 batting may have caught up with the pitching as pitcher Danny Jackson 
led the league with a 10-1 record and slugger Cliff Pastornicky paced the 
South Atlantic League with a .343 batting average. In 1983 Mark Pirruccello 
set a single-season team record with 25 home runs. 1984 was an exciting 
season for Charleston as the city hosted the all-star game in which Tom 
Glavine and Pat Borders played. On the field the Royals went on to win 
the Southern Division and Kevin Seitzer was named league MVP. In 1985 the 
team was renamed the Charleston Rainbows and became affiliated with the 
San Diego Padres. From 1985–1987 were the building years as the Rainbows 
improved each season under a great pitching staff until 1988 when they 
won the Southern Division title, but were bounced in the first round of 
the playoffs. The 1988 season was powered by a pitching staff whose combined 
ERA equaled 2.07. 1988 was the last of the "good ol' days", because starting 
in 1989 the team suffered 11 consecutive losing seasons. Poor play on the 
field translated into a South Atlantic League record, when in 1990 pitcher 
Charles Thompson registered 17 losses. In 1994 the team was renamed Charleston 
RiverDogs. Despite the name change, the losing continued. In 1997 saw the 
RiverDogs leave the 84-year-old College Park and move into the brand-new 
5,500-seat Joseph P. Riley, Jr. Park. The team also began its eight-year 
affiliation with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 1997. The move to the "Joe" 
helped to spur a rise in total attendance, as the team set a record with 
an increase in over 100,000 fans. Finally, in 2000 the 'Dogs posted their 
first winning season since 1988. In 2003 saw the beginning of a new era 
as the RiverDogs played well on the field and posted a winning season for 
the first time since 2000. In 2004 the RiverDogs secured the wildcard spot 
in the playoffs bringing Charleston a playoff series for the first time 
in 16 years. Charleston faced the hated rival Capital City in the first 
round, but were swept two games to none. The RiverDogs became the Class 
Single-A affiliate of the New York Yankees on September 15, 2004. 2005 
was another great season as the Riverdogs jumped out winning the first-half 
Southern Division Championship qualifying them for the playoffs for the 
first consecutive seasons in franchise history. The 2005 playoffs weren't 
as good to the RiverDogs as fans had hoped, because the RiverDogs fell 
to eventual champion the Kannapolis Intimidators two games to none. At 
the end of the 2005 season, Charleston was making an attempt to attract 
a Class Double-A team by expanding their stadium by a few hundred seats. 
2006 saw a good performance on the field, but no playoffs as the RiverDogs 
posted a 78–62 record. 2007 saw a record year for winning seasons when 
they finished the season with a 78–62 record and securing their fifth consecutive 
winning season tying a Charleston professional baseball record with the 
Sea Gulls (1914–1917, 1919) (No team in 1918). A downside to the record 
tying season was that the 'Dogs failed to make the playoffs for the second 
straight season. 2008 brought a memorable year to Charleston, as the Riverdogs 
recorded their final record at 80–59 bringing their sixth consecutive winning 
season, breaking a record for the most consecutive winning seasons (a record 
that stood since 1919) in Charleston baseball history. The downside to 
2008 was the third straight season the Riverdogs failed to make the playoffs 
– despite having the best record in the Southern Division each season, 
they never held the division lead at the end of a half-season to claim 
a playoff spot. The 2009 season saw the Riverdogs finish with a winning 
record again. In the first half the Riverdogs came up a game short to their 
arch-rival Greenville Drive and never posed as a threat in the second half 
failing to make the playoffs for the fourth straight year. After posting 
a 232-186 record Riverdogs manager Torre Tyson was named the Tampa Yankees 
manager in High A baseball. The RiverDogs were quick to name hitting coach 
Greg Colbrunn as the new manager for the 2010 season. With the RiverDogs 
on the verge of making the playoffs each of the last four seasons, expectations 
were high for Colbrunn.[citation needed] The day following the 2015 Charleston 
church shooting, the RiverDogs decided to proceed with their regularly 
scheduled game, with Dave Echols, the team's general manager, saying: "We 
feel it is our duty not to let the acts of one radical human being dictate 
our lives". The RiverDogs donated the proceeds of the night's game to the 
charity set up for the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.[2] Baseball 
can be traced in Charleston back to 1886 when the Charleston Seagulls took 
the field in front of only 32 people at an old high school baseball field. 
But over time the Seagulls became the Sea Gulls and were in full swing 
having great on-field play which included winning the South Atlantic League 
Championship in 1907. Due to unknown reasons the Sea Gulls did not play 
in 1910. They did, however play in 1911, but towards the end of the season, 
on August 11, 1911, a hurricane destroyed their stadium which resulted 
in their not playing in 1912. In 1913 a brand new facility was built for 
the Seagulls, named College Park. Eventually in 1919, the Sea Gulls became 
officially the Gulls. Starting in 1920 the Gulls became the Palmettos, 
however, later that year that name was shortened to the Pals while Charleston 
was promoted to "Class B". In 1922 the Pals created excitement around Charleston 
as they won the South Atlantic League title, but due to unknown reasons 
the Pals folded at the end of the season, and that lead to a 16-year baseball 
drought in Charleston. Finally in 1940 a new team began play in the South 
Atlantic League known as the Charleston Rebels. Just two years later, in 
1942 the Rebels won the South Atlantic League Championship ending a 20-year 
championship drought. However, the next year the Rebels posted a losing 
record. 1947 started out with a bang as the Rebels were promoted to Class 
A and drew 184,851 fans in the season, a Charleston baseball record that 
stood until 1997. After all the excitement from the 1947 season, the Rebels 
went out and won the South Atlantic League Championship for the second 
time in seven years in 1948, the last time Charleston won a championship. 
After that memorable season the Rebels declined and couldn't post a winning 
season. With fans losing interest the Rebels folded at the end of the 1953 
season. In 1959 baseball returned to Charleston, but this time the team 
was affiliated with a Major League Baseball Team, the Chicago White Sox. 
The experiment failed horribly as attendance was down by more than 50% 
and the White Sox failed to post consecutive winning seasons. In 1973 the 
Charleston Pirates were born, who were affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
and for the first time since 1893 were playing in a league other than the 
South Atlantic League, they were in the Western Carolinas League. As the 
Pirates, Charleston excelled in pitching as in 1973 John Candelaria led 
the league with a 10–2 record. The following year the Pirates pitcher Randy 
Sealy set a team record with a 1.97 ERA. However, after those promising 
years the Pirates set a league record by losing 22 straight games. In 1976 
and 1977 the Pirates became the Patriots, but the name change still had 
no effect on the team's play as the team failed to post a winning record 
and watched attendance plunge. Finally, in 1978 the Pirates decided enough 
was enough and left town. By now Charleston had been given countless chances 
to prove that they could support a baseball team, so the city began to 
give up on baseball. Little, however, did Charlestonians know that commitment 
and tradition was just around the corner, and a bright future was in store 
for Charleston baseball. Note: W = Wins, L = Losses A number of ex-RiverDogs 
have gone on to make a name for themselves in Major League Baseball, including: 
B. J. Upton, Carl Crawford, Rocco Baldelli, Delmon Young, Seth McClung, 
Josh Hamilton, Toby Hall, and Aubrey Huff, who all played for the RiverDogs, 
Sandy Alomar, Jr., Roberto Alomar, and Carlos Baerga who all played for 
the Rainbows, Fernando Tatís, and David Cone and John Candelaria who played 
for the Royals. Phil Hughes, David Robertson, Austin Jackson, John Axford, 
Eduardo Núñez, and Phil Coke have also played for the RiverDogs more recently.
