Mathew "Mike" Campbell (1850 – January 12, 1926) was an American baseball 
player at the beginning of the professional era, primarily with teams in 
northern New Jersey. He was born in Ireland. 1866. Mike and his older brother 
Hugh Campbell joined the Irvington club of Irvington, New Jersey, for the 
1866 season. The Irvingtons were a new member of the National Association 
of Base Ball Players, and a "country club" in that Irvington was still 
outside the growing metropolis. (Irvington is in Essex County, closer to 
Newark and the Hudson River than to the western boundary.) In one sense 
most of the Association was new; membership boomed to 98 clubs for 1866, 
up from merely 30 including 22 in Greater New York. Hugh Campbell and at 
least two Irvington teammates had played for the Newark club in 1865. In 
their first match of the season on June 14, Irvington shocked the champion 
Brooklyn Atlantics 23 to 17, who were undefeated for two seasons. Irvington 
would take the championship from Atlantic if it could schedule a rematch 
or two and win at least one of them before any other club beat the champions 
in two of three. Location helped Irvington get two rematches but they did 
not get the one win. Atlantic won 28–11 in September and 12–6 in ten innings 
on October 29.[1] Sixteen-year-old Mike Campbell played 13 of 17 team games 
on record and he was the regular at first base. He made more than an equal 
share of outs and scored less than an equal share of runs. Hugh Campbell 
played 17 games on record, primarily at center field. The best players 
were pitcher Rynie Wolters and catcher Andy Leonard. 1867. All nine regular 
players returned to the Irvingtons for 1867 and they were joined by Lip 
Pike for part of the season. Pike had moved from New York to play for the 
1866 Athletics, presumably for some compensation; his subsequent move to 
the Irvingtons suggests compensation too. They were again one of the stronger 
teams in the association, winning 16 of 23 matches on record; in June and 
July they won two close ones from Union of Morrisania, who would take the 
crown in October. Pitcher Wolters was against the team's outstanding batter, 
measured by runs scored and hands lost. Otherwise the attack was balanced 
and Mike Campbell at seventeen was one among equals. He played 21 matches, 
tie for the lead. 1868. The New York Mutuals acquired Lip Pike during the 
1867 season and two more of the Irvingtons for 1868, shortstop Mahlon Stockman 
and the great Wolters. At the same time Andy Leonard and Charlie Sweasy 
moved to the Buckeyes, an ambitious club in Cincinnati. Although five regular 
players remained, the team was much weakened and no longer adequately covered 
in the known records. Mike Campbell may have been the best remaining batter-runner. 
In 10 matches he scored 24 runs with 22 hands lost (times put out), the 
highest ratio on the team. In 1873 Mike Campbell was the starting first 
baseman for the Elizabeth Resolutes of the National Association. Campbell 
was an average fielder and a poor hitter for the 2-21 Resolutes. In 21 
games he batted 12-for 83 (.145) with three runs batted in and nine runs 
scored. His older brother, Hugh Campbell, was the team's main starting
