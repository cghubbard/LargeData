Clinton Daniel Gladden III (born July 7, 1957) is an American former Major 
League Baseball player and current radio broadcaster. Known as "The Dazzle 
Man", he attended California State University, Fresno and was signed by 
the San Francisco Giants as an amateur free agent in 1979. He made his 
debut with the Giants in 1983, and in 1984 he batted .351 with 31 stolen 
bases as the Giants' center fielder. In 1987, Gladden was traded to the 
Minnesota Twins, and won a World Series championship with them in his first 
year. In Game 1, he hit the first grand slam in a World Series game in 
17 years. He would earn another World Series ring with the Twins in 1991, 
when they beat the Atlanta Braves in what is sometimes called the greatest 
World Series ever played.[1] In the intense and memorable Game 7 of the 
1991 Series, Gladden stretched a bloop hit into a double before scoring 
the winning run on Gene Larkin's single off of Atlanta's Alejandro Peña, 
in the bottom of the 10th inning. After the 1991 season, Gladden signed 
as a free agent with the Detroit Tigers, and played with them until 1993. 
He spent 1994 in Japan playing for the Yomiuri Giants, winning a Japan 
Series championship. Because of the 1994-95 MLBPA strike, Gladden's championship 
with the kyojin is regarded by some fans as a world championship, and he 
retired from the game as a player on top as a three-time world champion 
with the distinction of having won championships in two continents (as 
does teammate Hideki Matsui, who won the World Series in 2009 with the 
New York Yankees), and returned to the Twins as a scout (spring training, 
1995), then the Colorado Rockies (advance, 1996–1998). He spent 1999 as 
a roving instructor for the San Francisco Giants. Gladden was one of seven 
Twins to be part of both the 1987 and 1991 World Series teams. The other 
six were Randy Bush, Greg Gagne, Kirby Puckett, Al Newman, Gene Larkin, 
and Kent Hrbek. In 2000, Gladden became the color commentator on the Twins' 
radio network broadcast, most notably on WCCO-AM through 2006 and on the 
Twins Radio Network and its Metro Affiliate KSTP starting in 2007. He worked 
alongside Frick award-winning commentator Herb Carneal and the Twins' play-by-play 
man, John Gordon; Carneal died on April 1, 2007, leaving Gladden to deliver 
color commentary full-time. Gladden is an avid owner and rider of Harley 
Davidson motorcycles and sometimes takes time off to ride and attend famous 
bike rallies. Gladden currently lives with his wife and two daughters in 
Eden Prairie, Minnesota. Gladden's daughter Ashley married the son of his
