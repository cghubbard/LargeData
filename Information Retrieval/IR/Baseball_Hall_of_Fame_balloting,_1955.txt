Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1955 followed a system established 
for odd-number years in 1953. The eligibility of retired players was extended; 
previously, a player could not be on the BBWAA ballot if he had retired 
more than 25 years prior. The ballot could now include those who had been 
retired for up to 30 years. The Baseball Writers Association of America 
(BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players and elected 
four: Joe DiMaggio, Gabby Hartnett, Ted Lyons, and Dazzy Vance. The Veterans 
Committee met in closed sessions to consider executives, managers, umpires, 
and earlier players. It selected two players, Frank Baker and Ray Schalk. 
The BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1925 or later, but 
not after 1949. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote. 
Any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored 
with induction to the Hall. Votes were cast for 65 players; a total of 
251 ballots were cast, with 189 votes required for election. A total of 
2,391 individual votes were cast, an average of 9.53 per ballot. For the 
third time, the election produced at least four inductees, a feat that 
would not be repeated for another 60 years (in 2015). The four candidates 
who received 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; 
candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated
