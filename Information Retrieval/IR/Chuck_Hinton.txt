Charles Edward (Chuck) Hinton, Jr. (May 3, 1934 – January 27, 2013) was 
an American professional baseball player. An outfielder, Hinton played 
in Major League Baseball for the Washington Senators (1961–64), Cleveland 
Indians (1965–67, 1969–71) and California Angels (1968). He batted and 
threw right-handed. In an eleven-season career, Hinton posted a .264 batting 
average with 113 home runs and 443 runs batted in in 1353 games played. 
Hinton attended Shaw University, where he played baseball, American football, 
and basketball for the Shaw Bears. He served for two years in the United 
States Army.[1] In 1956, Hinton attended a baseball tryout camp, where 
he signed a contract with the Baltimore Orioles. He won two minor-league 
batting championships in the Orioles system, playing with the Aberdeen 
Pheasants of the Class C Northern League in 1959 and the Stockton Ports 
of the Class C California League in 1960.[1] The Orioles promoted Hinton 
to the Vancouver Mounties of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League during 
the 1960 season. Afraid they might lose Hinton in the 1960 Major League 
Baseball (MLB) expansion draft, the Orioles had Hinton fake a shoulder 
injury during winter league baseball.[2] Despite this, the Washington Senators 
selected Hinton in the expansion draft.[1] The Senators optioned Hinton 
to the Indianapolis Indians of the Class AAA American Association before 
the regular season began.[3] They promoted Hinton from the minor leagues 
on May 14, 1961,[4] and he made his MLB debut the next day. He finished 
the 1961 season with a .260 batting average.[2] In 1962, he had a .310 
batting average, good for fourth in the American League,[1] and finished 
second in stolen bases to Luis Aparicio.[2] Hit in the head with a pitch 
on September 5, 1963, Hinton was unconscious when he was carried off the 
field. He returned to the lineup eight days later, but felt limited by 
symptoms of the concussion.[1] Hinton was named to represent the American 
League in the 1964 MLB All-Star Game.[5] After the 1964 season, the Senators 
traded Hinton to the Cleveland Indians for Bob Chance and Woodie Held.[6] 
The Indians traded Hinton to the California Angels for José Cardenal after 
the 1967 season.[7] Hinton batted .195 in the 1968 season with the Angels. 
Just before the 1969 season, the Angels traded Hinton back to the Indians 
for Lou Johnson.[8] The Indians released Hinton after the 1969 season. 
In all, Hinton played six years with the Indians. From 1972 to 2000, Hinton 
worked for Howard University as the head coach of the Howard Bison baseball 
team. Hinton led the Bison to their first Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference 
championship.[1] In 1982, he founded the Major League Baseball Players 
Alumni Association (MLBPAA), a non-profit organization which promotes the 
game of baseball, raises money for charities, inspires and educates youth 
through positive sport images and protects the dignity of the game through 
former players.[1] Hinton and his wife, Irma, lived in Washington, D.C.
