The Ohio State Buckeyes are the athletic teams that represent Ohio State 
University, named after the colloquial term for people from the state of 
Ohio and after the state tree, the Ohio Buckeye.[2][3] The Buckeyes participate 
in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I in 
all sports and the Big Ten Conference in most sports. The Ohio State women's 
ice hockey team competes in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). 
The school colors are scarlet and gray. Ohio State's mascot is Brutus Buckeye. 
Ohio State is one of only five universities to have won a NCAA national 
championship in baseball and men's basketball, and be recognized as a national 
champion in football. Ohio State has also won national championships in 
men's swimming & diving, men's outdoor track & field, men's volleyball, 
men's golf, men's gymnastics, men's fencing, co-ed fencing, synchronized 
swimming, and wrestling.[4] Since the inception of the Athletic Director's 
Cup, Ohio State has finished in the top 25 each year, including top 6 finishes 
in three of the last five years.[5] During the 2005-2006 school year Ohio 
State became the first Big Ten team to win conference championships in 
football, men's basketball and women's basketball in the same season. They 
repeated this feat in the 2006-2007 season, which also included a February 
25, 2007 men's basketball game which saw the Buckeyes defeat the Wisconsin 
Badgers in the Big Ten's first one-versus-two basketball game. A few of 
the many outstanding sports figures who were student athletes at Ohio State 
include Jesse Owens, “The Buckeye Bullet,” (track and field), John Havlicek, 
Jerry Lucas, and Katie Smith (basketball), Frank Howard (baseball), Jack 
Nicklaus (golf), Archie Griffin (football running back, the only two-time 
Heisman Trophy winner), and Chic Harley (three-time All-American football 
running back). Hall of Fame coaches at Ohio State have included Paul Brown 
and Woody Hayes (football), Fred Taylor (men's basketball). Notable sports 
figures in Ohio State history may be inducted into the Ohio State Varsity 
O Hall of Fame. The Ohio State men's basketball team has played in 10 NCAA 
Final Fours, winning the championship in 1960, when they were led by Basketball 
Hall of Famers Jerry Lucas, John Havlicek, and Bob Knight off the bench. 
A Buckeye has been named first team All-American 23 times, including five 
two-time All-Americans and one three-time All-American. Between 1960 and 
1964, Ohio State won five consecutive Big Ten championships, an achievement 
that has yet to be matched. In 2004, Ohio State fired men's basketball 
coach Jim O'Brien for recruiting violations and self-imposed a one-year 
penalty, including a ban on post-season play and reduction of scholarships. 
In light of these University self-imposed penalties, the NCAA Division 
I Committee on infractions merely placed Ohio State on three years probation 
for the violations, and gave heavier penalties to Coach O'Brien and a former 
assistant coach.[6] The lightness of this judgment was seen as encouragement 
for schools to be proactive in responding to violations. Nevertheless, 
O'Brien successfully sued Ohio State for improper termination. Thad Matta, 
the current coach of the Buckeyes, took over O'Brien's spot in 2004. Ohio 
State recruited such talents as Greg Oden, and Mike Conley, Jr. to start 
the 2006-2007 year. The Buckeyes finished the season with a 27-3 record; 
won the Big Ten tournament, and earned a number 1 seed for the NCAA tournament. 
After a very close game with state rival Xavier, and a thrilling 20 point 
come from behind victory against the Tennessee Volunteers, the Buckeyes 
managed to hold off Georgetown Hoyas 67-60 to reach the Championship Game 
for the first time since 1962, which they lost to defending NCAA champions 
Florida Gators, 84-75. Following years saw continued success for the Buckeyes. 
They won the Big Ten Championship in both the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 season, 
and reached the Final Four in 2011-2012 before losing to Kansas. The Buckeyes 
reached the Elite Eight in 2012-2013, losing to Wichita State. 2013-2014 
and 2014-2015 both saw early exits from the NCAA Tournament. Currently 
coached by Kevin McGuff, the Ohio State women's basketball team plays its 
home games in the Jerome Schottenstein Center, which they moved into in 
1998. Prior to 1998, they played at St. John Arena. They have won 10 Big 
Ten titles, which is the most in the conference[7] and have 14 appearances 
in the NCAA Tournament, the most recent being in 2007. In 1993 they lost 
to the Texas Tech Lady Raiders 84-82 for the National Title, while they 
captured the NIT title in 2001, beating the New Mexico Lobos 62-61.[8] 
Notable alumni include former All-Americans Katie Smith and Jessica Davenport. 
Ohio State's two golf courses, the Scarlet and the Gray, were completed 
in 1938. The Scarlet was designed by architect Alister MacKenzie, who designed 
the Masters course at Augusta National. However, his original design was 
not implemented fully, and the greens were the only part of the course 
that truly resembled his designs. Golf magazines annually rate the Scarlet 
Course as one of the top collegiate courses in the nation. The Scarlet 
recently underwent a $4.2 million renovation under the supervision of Jack 
Nicklaus. Ohio State has won the NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships 
in 1945 and 1979. Five times, Buckeye men have won the NCAA golf individual 
championship: John Lorms in 1945, Tom Nieporte in 1951, Robert Jones in 
1956, Jack Nicklaus in 1961 and Clark Burroughs in 1985. They have won 
23 Big Ten Conference championships. Ohio State has played baseball since 
1881,[9] winning a national championship in 1966 along with 14 Big Ten 
regular-season titles and eight Big Ten tournament titles. The Buckeyes 
baseball team was the first Ohio State sports team. The team is currently 
coached by Greg Beals and play their home games at Bill Davis Stadium, 
which opened in 1997. Going into the 2008 season the Buckeyes all-time 
record is 2228-1427-38. Notable alumni include Frank Howard, Nick Swisher 
and two time All-American Steve Arlin. In the team event, Ohio State has 
won 29 collegiate championships between 1977, the first year of the collegiate 
national championships, and 2004. Head coach Mary Jo Ruggieri led the team 
to 17 wins between 1977 and 1995, and Linda Lichter-Witter added seven 
more since 1996. Ohio State also has taken 61 individual honors in that 
span, including 11 by Karen and Sarah Josephson. Head Coach Holly Vargo-Brown 
led the team to their 29th total championship in 2015. The Ohio State gymnastics 
team has won three national titles and nine Big Ten titles, and has produced 
4 Nissen Award winners (The Heisman Trophy of Men's Gymnastics). The team 
is currently coached by Rustam Sharipov. The Buckeyes have all their competitions 
at St. John Arena in Columbus, Ohio. Some of the more notable Buckeye alumni 
include Don Perry, the first OSU All-American in the sport (Trampoline 
- 1954 - 4th place), brothers Seth and Noah Riskin - Co-national Champions 
(Parallel Bars - 1985 - 1st place), and Mike Racanelli - Ohio State's first 
Nissen winner in 1990. Racanelli also went on to win Gymnastic's first 
Ohio State Male Athlete of the Year Award that same year, given out annually 
to the athlete who displays the best performance in his sport (regardless 
of grade). Following later in Racanelli's footsteps were other Nissen winners 
Kip Simons (1994), Blaine Wilson (1997) and Jamie Natalie (2001). Blaine 
Wilson (1995, 1996, 1997) and Jamie Natalie (2000, 2001) also went on to 
win Ohio State Male Athlete of the Year. Raj Bhavsar was the only other 
Men's Gymnast to win Ohio State Athlete of the Year which he accomplished 
in 2002. On the Olympic and World Championship stage, OSU Men's Gymnastics 
is well represented, by gymnasts and coaches. The Olympian list includes: 
Miles Avery (asst coach 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008), Peter Kormann (Athlete 
in 1976, Head Coach 1996, 2000), Raj Bhavsar (2004, 2008), Jamie Natalie 
(2000), Gil Pinto (1988), Kip Simons (1994) and Blaine Wilson (1996, 2000, 
2004). Two gymnasts who trained at the Ohio State facilities under coach 
Miles Avery, but were not NCAA Athletes due to eligibility rules, were 
Paul and Morgan Hamm - twin brothers from Wisconsin. Paul later went on 
to win the first ever Olympic Gold medal in the Men's Gymnastics All-Around 
competition for the United States. In 2011, Senior co-captain, Brandon 
Wynn, won his second national championship on rings. Brandon Wynn, Ty Echard, 
Kris Done and Jeff Treleaven earned All-America honors. In all, the seven 
All-America honors tie the second-best single-season performance in program 
history and are the most laurels since the 2005 campaign. The Ohio State 
men's ice hockey team was established in 1961 and played at the OSU Ice 
Rink until 1999, when they moved into Value City Arena. The Buckeyes competed 
in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) through the 2012-2013 
season. After Penn State added men's ice hockey as a Division I sport in 
2012, the Big Ten had enough teams to sponsor its own hockey conference 
and began play in the 2013-2014 season. The Buckeyes won one conference 
championship in 1972, the first year of the CCHA, and won the conference 
tournament in 1974 and 2004. The Buckeyes have made it to the NCAA tournament 
in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2009, and went to the semi-finals 
in 1998. In 2006, they retired Paul Pooley's #22, the only number to be 
retired by the hockey program to date.[10] The Ohio State women’s ice hockey 
team was started in 1999 and competes in the Western Collegiate Hockey 
Association (WCHA). The Buckeyes have yet to make an NCAA post season appearance.[11] 
Notable Buckeye alumni include Olympians Emma Laaksonen, Tessa Bonhomme, 
and Lisa Chesson. The Men’s and Women’s Varsity Tennis teams have showed 
success both individually and as a team. Both the men's and women's teams 
share the outdoor tennis facility, the Stickney Tennis Center, dedicated 
in 1993. When the weather takes them indoors, both teams play at the Varsity 
Tennis Center, which was recently completed in November 2007. The outdoor 
facility has 12 courts and the indoor has six courts and are both located 
in Columbus, Ohio. Men's Tennis - Big Ten Championships - 1915 (co-champions), 
1943, 1991, 2001, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 NCAA Men's 
Tennis Tournament Team Appearances (since 1977) - 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 
2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 The Men's tennis 
team has 23 NCAA Singles Appearances, 11 NCAA Doubles Appearances and eight 
All-Americans.[12] Women's Tennis - Big Ten Championships - 1974, 1975, 
1976, 1977, 1978, 1979 - Note: The Big Ten officially began sponsoring 
championships for women with the 1981-82 season. Since then, Ohio State 
has yet to win a Big Ten Championship. Ohio State recently won their first 
Big Ten Championship in school history in 2016, after defeating TTUN in 
the finals. NCAA Women's Tennis Tournament Team Appearances - 1996, 1999, 
2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009. The Women have five NCAA Singles 
Appearances, four NCAA Doubles Appearances and two All-Americans.[12] In 
June, 2013, Ohio State became a charter member of the Patriot Rifle Conference. 
It was also announced that the Buckeyes will host the inaugural PRC championship 
meet on February 8 & 9, 2014. The Buckeye softball team has appeared in 
one Women's College World Series in 1982.[13] Ohio State wrestling was 
established at the University in 1921. Once the coach of Hofstra University 
for 11 years, currently the Head Coach of the team is Tom Ryan. He has 
been coaching Ohio State since the 2006-2007 wrestling season. His coaching 
ability led the Buckeye Wrestling team to 5 NCAA Championship appearances 
and as the runners-up twice in the NCAA Championships in 2008 & 2009 in 
8 years with the team.[14] The team has a practice facility named Steelwood 
Athletic Training Facility and competes on campus in the St. John Arena 
(capacity of over 13,000 people).[15] Two-time NCAA wrestling champion 
Jeffrey Jaggers, or commonly referred to as J Jaggers, made a seamless 
transition from student-athlete to coach in 2009-10 as the volunteer assistant 
coach and now is in his fourth year as a full-time assistant and fifth 
overall. Mark Coleman was a former Buckeye wrestler and a 1988 Big Ten 
Conference Champion & NCAA Champion Wrestler (190 lbs). Coleman went on 
to become a Silver Medalist in the 1991 FILA Wrestling World Championships, 
who then became a UFC Hall of Fame member.[16] In 2015, Ohio State won 
its first national championship, after coming close in 2008 and 2009. It 
broke Penn State's streak of four consecutive team titles, but extended 
the Big Ten's national championship run to nine with the help of 4-time 
NCAA champion Logan Stieber. 2015 Ohio State wrestler Kyle Snyder (wrestler) 
becomes youngest World Champion in United States Wrestling History. On 
Friday September 11 Kyle won five matches including a dramatic ending in 
the gold medal round at 97 kg/213 lbs. Trailing 4-3 with less than a minute 
remaining, Snyder got a takedown against returning World champion Abdusalam 
Gadisov of Russia and ultimately prevailed by criteria with the score tied 
at 5-5. "It is amazing hearing the USA chants, especially on a day like 
today – September 11," said Snyder. "It's important to come out here and 
represent your country to the best of your ability." Ohio State University 
Buckeye Wrestling Team Accomplishments include: NCAA Championships: 2015 
Ohio State has produced over two hundred Olympic athletes, most notably 
Jesse Owens who won four Olympic gold medals at the 1936 Berlin Olympics 
and is one of the greatest Olympians in history. In all, 48 Ohio State 
athletes have combined for a total of 77 Olympic medals which includes 
33 gold, 28 silver and 16 bronze medals. Ohio State's track team is coached 
by Ed Beathea, and hosts home meets at Jesse Owens Memorial Stadium. The 
Buckeyes' track team is also famous for being the first Buckeye team in 
any sport to win a national title. Mal Whitfield was the 1948 and 1952 
Olympic Gold Medalist in the 800 Meters. His daughter is Fredericka Whitfield 
of CNN. Founded in 1966, Ohio State's Rugby Football Club plays college 
rugby in Division 1-A in the Big Ten Universities conference against traditional 
Big 10 rivals such as Michigan. The Buckeyes are led by head coach Ron 
Bowers, who played rugby as a Buckeye, earning All-American honors in 1991.[17] 
The Buckeyes best performances were in the 1990 and 1991 seasons, when 
they finished third in the nation in both seasons. More recently, Ohio 
State has appeared in the Collegiate Rugby Championship, a tournament broadcast 
live on NBC, finishing 7th in 2010 and 14th in 2011. The Buckeyes were 
led in those two tournaments by Nate Ebner, who was named to the competition's 
All Tournament Team in 2010 and 2011,[18][19] before entering the 2012 
NFL draft and signing with the New England Patriots. The Buckeyes finished 
the 2010-11 season ranked 23rd in the country.[20] Ohio State finished 
third at the 2012 Big Ten 7s, missing out on qualification to the 2012 
USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships. Ohio State has won 
29 NCAA team titles.[21] Below are 45 national team titles that were not 
bestowed by the NCAA (including sports it has never sponsored):[22] On 
April 2, 2009, Ohio State signed a 10-year media-rights agreement with 
IMG College and RadiOhio, worth nearly $128 million, the largest such agreement 
in college sports.[23] The Ohio State University Marching Band (nicknamed 
"The Best Damn Band In The Land"[24]) is currently under direction of Dr. 
Christopher Hoch. This all brass band has 225 members, and was first formed 
in 1878. The band has traditions including a field march that forms a "Script 
Ohio", during which, a senior sousaphone player gets to "dot the i" in 
the word Ohio. The Ohio State school colors of scarlet and gray were chosen 
by a committee of three students (Curtis C. Howard, Harwood R. Pool, and 
Alice Townshend) prior to the school's first graduation ceremony in 1878. 
The committee's original recommendation was to be orange and black. The 
committee soon discovered that Princeton already used the colors, however, 
and changed their recommendation.[25] For this reason some references claim 
that Ohio State's original school colors were orange and black. This claim 
is not quite accurate, in that the committee never filed the original report
