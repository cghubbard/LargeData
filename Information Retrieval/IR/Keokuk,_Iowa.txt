Keokuk /ˈkiːəkʌk/ is a city and a county seat of Lee County, Iowa, United 
States,[5] along with Fort Madison. It is also the most southerly city 
in Iowa. The population was 10,780 at the 2010 census. The city is named 
after the Sauk chief Keokuk, who is thought to be buried in Rand Park. 
It is located in the extreme southeast corner of Iowa where the Des Moines 
River meets with the Mississippi. It is located at the junction of U.S. 
Routes 61, 136 and 218. Just across the rivers are the towns of Hamilton 
and Warsaw, Illinois, and Alexandria, Missouri. Keokuk, along with the 
city of Fort Madison, is a principal city of the Fort Madison-Keokuk micropolitan 
area, which includes all of Lee County, Iowa and Clark County, Missouri. 
Situated between the Des Moines and Mississippi rivers, the area that became 
Keokuk had access to a large trading area and was an ideal location for 
settlers. In 1820, the US Army prohibited soldiers stationed along the 
Mississippi River from having wives who were Native American.[6] Dr. Samuel 
C. Muir, a surgeon stationed at Fort Edwards (near present-day Warsaw, 
Illinois), instead resigned his commission rather than leave his Indian 
wife and crossed the river to resettle. He built a log cabin for them at 
the bottom of the bluff, and became the area’s first white settler. As 
steamboat traffic on the Mississippi increased, more European Americans 
began to settle here. Around 1827, John Jacob Astor established a post 
of his American Fur Company at the foot of the bluff. Five buildings were 
erected to house workers and the business. This area became known as the 
“Rat Row.” One of the earliest descriptions of Keokuk was by Caleb Atwater 
in 1829: The settlement was part of the land designated in 1824 as a Half-Breed 
Tract by the United States Government for allotting land to mixed-race 
descendants of the Sauk and Fox tribes.[8] Typically children of European 
or British men (fur traders and trappers) and Native women, they were often 
excluded from tribal communal lands because their fathers were not tribal 
members. Native Americans considered the settlement a neutral ground.[9] 
Rules for the tract prohibited individual sale of the land, but the US 
Congress ended this provision in 1837, creating a land rush and instability.[8] 
Centering on the riverboat trade, the settlement continued to grow. The 
village became known as Keokuk shortly after the Blackhawk War in 1832. 
Why residents named it after the Sauk chief is unknown. Keokuk was incorporated 
on December 13, 1847. In 1853, Keokuk was one of the centers for outfitting 
Mormon pioneers for their journey west; more than 2,000 Mormons passed 
through the city.[10] Keokuk was the longtime home of Orion Clemens, brother 
of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain. Samuel's visits to his brother's 
home led him to write of the beauty of Keokuk and southeastern Iowa in 
Life on the Mississippi.[11] During the American Civil War, Keokuk became 
an embarking point for Union troops heading to fight in southern battles. 
Injured soldiers were returned to Keokuk for treatment, so several hospitals 
were established. A national cemetery was designated for those who did 
not survive. After the war was over, Keokuk continued its expansion. A 
medical college was founded, along with a major-league baseball team, the 
Keokuk Westerns, in 1875. In 1913, Lock and Dam No. 19 was completed nearby 
on the Mississippi River. The population of Keokuk reached 15,106 by 1930.[12] 
During the last half of the twentieth century, Keokuk has become less engaged 
in Mississippi River trade and more dependent on jobs in local factories. 
The town celebrated 150 years in 1997. Keokuk has deep baseball history 
that started in 1875 when the Keokuk Westerns played in the National Association. 
On May 4, 1875, the Westerns and the Chicago White Stockings (today's Chicago 
Cubs) played the first professional baseball game in Iowa.[13] The Keokuk 
Indians minor league team played in the Iowa State League (1904-1907), 
Central Association (1908-1915), Mississippi Valley League (1929-1933) 
and Western League (1935). After the Indians (1904-1915, 1929-1933, 1935), 
Keokuk was home to the Keokuk Pirates (1947-1949), Keokuk Kernels (1952-1957), 
Keokuk Cardinals (1958-1961) and the Keokuk Dodgers (1962).[14] The team 
was an affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cleveland 
Indians and the Los Angeles Dodgers.[15] Notable players included baseball 
pioneer Bud Fowler, 1961 Home Run Record Holder Roger Maris and Player/Announcer 
Tim McCarver.[16] Keokuk is located at 40°24′9″N 91°23′40″W﻿ / ﻿40.40250°N

A few miles north of Keokuk is the Galland School, a replica of the first 
schoolhouse constructed in Iowa. The Mississippi River lock and dam along 
with the hydroelectric power plant were built in 1913. They still use most 
of the original equipment. When the plant began operation in August 1913, 
it was the largest single powerhouse electric generating plant in the world.[23] 
It is part of the Keokuk Lock & Dam, both of which are visible from a park 
at the foot of the commercial district. Built in 1913, the old lock was 
too small to serve the newer, larger barges. It was replaced in 1957 with 
a 1200' x 110' lock. At the time of construction in 1913, this was the 
longest dam in the world, with the longest transmission line and the highest 
voltage in the world. The Chief Engineer was Hugh L. Cooper. Designed by 
Merle F. Baker, the Grand Theatre was constructed on the foundation of 
the Keokuk Opera House (c. 1880), which burned down in 1923. Modeled after 
theaters in Chicago, it was praised as one of the finest theaters in the 
country at the time. The Grand Theatre is owned by the city of Keokuk and 
used as a performing arts center. The theatre has housed many historically 
important performers over the years, including John Philip Sousa and Maynard 
Ferguson. The Iowa Water Council has ranked the tap water produced at the 
Keokuk Waterworks Plant as the "Best Tasting Water In Iowa". Keokuk is 
home to the Keokuk National Cemetery, the Keokuk Veteran's Memorial, the 
Miller House Museum, an annual American Civil War reenactment, and the 
George M. Verity River Museum. Each summer Keokuk is home to "Rollin' on 
the River," a local blues festival that attracts hundreds to Victory Park. 
The Irish-themed McNamara's Band is a community concert band that has performed 
for decades. It regularly performs throughout the area. Once a month the 
jazz big band, "Craig Bullis and Friends," performs at the local Hawkeye 
restaurant. The band is made up of area jazz musicians, as well as both 
collegiate-level students and professors of music. The band has featured 
such guest artists as Reggie Watkins, former lead trombone and music arranger 
for Maynard Ferguson and Big Bop Nouveau. The notable garage band Gonn 
is from Keokuk Keokuk is home to the Great River Players, a thespian troupe 
that strives "to provide quality amateur theatrical productions for the 
tri-state area by encouraging members of the surrounding communities to 
express their creative abilities in all aspects of live theatre." The troupe
