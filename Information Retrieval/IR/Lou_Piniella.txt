As player As manager Louis Victor Piniella (/piːnˈjeɪjɑː/[1][2] usually 
/pɨˈnɛlə/; born August 28, 1943[3]) is a former professional baseball player 
and manager. An outfielder in the major leagues, he played five seasons 
with the Kansas City Royals and eleven seasons with the New York Yankees, 
then led five teams as manager. Piniella was nicknamed "Sweet Lou", both 
for his swing as a major league hitter and, facetiously, to describe his 
demeanor as a player and manager. He finished his managerial career ranked 
14th all-time on the list of managerial wins. Born in Tampa, Florida, Piniella's 
parents were of Asturian descent, from northwest Spain.[1][4][5][6] He 
grew up in West Tampa, and played American Legion baseball[7][8] and PONY 
League baseball alongside Tony La Russa.[9] Piniella attended Jesuit High 
School in Tampa, where he was an All-American in basketball.[10] After 
graduation in 1961,[11][12][13] he attended the University of Tampa for 
a year, where he was a College Division (today's Division II) All-American 
in baseball for the Spartans.[14] Piniella was signed by the Cleveland 
Indians at age 18 as an amateur free agent on June 9, 1962.[15] That fall, 
he was drafted by the Washington Senators from the Indians in the 1962 
first year draft. In August 1964, Piniella was sent to the Baltimore Orioles 
to complete an earlier trade for Buster Narum, and Piniella played in his 
first major league game that September with the Orioles at the age of 21. 
Prior to the 1966 season, he was traded by the Orioles back to the Indians 
for Cam Carreon, and made his second major league appearance in September 
1968 at age 24 with the Indians. Piniella was selected by the Seattle Pilots 
in the 1968 expansion draft in October, but was traded after spring training 
on April 1 to the Kansas City Royals for John Gelnar and Steve Whitaker.[16] 
He was prominently mentioned in Jim Bouton's classic book about the Seattle 
Pilots, Ball Four. Piniella played for the Royals for their first five 
seasons, 1969 through 1973, and was the American League's Rookie of the 
Year in 1969 and was named to the 1972 All-Star Game. He was the first 
batter in Royals history; on April 8 of their first season in 1969, he 
led off the bottom of the first inning against left-hander Tom Hall of 
the Minnesota Twins. Piniella doubled to left field, then scored on an 
RBI single by Jerry Adair. After the 1973 season, Piniella was traded by 
the Royals with Ken Wright to the New York Yankees for Lindy McDaniel. 
He played with the Yankees for 11 seasons, during which the Yankees won 
five AL East titles (1976–78, 1980, and 1981), four AL pennants (1976–78, 
and 1981), and two World Series championships (1977–78). In 1975, he missed 
part of the year with an inner ear infection. From mid-1977 through the 
end of 1980, he was the Yankees' regular outfielder/DH. In his career, 
Piniella made one All-Star team and compiled 1705 lifetime hits despite 
not playing full-time for just under half of his career. He received 2 
votes for the Hall of Fame as a player in 1990. After retiring as a player, 
Piniella joined the Yankees coaching staff as the hitting coach. He managed 
the Yankees from 1986 to 1987. Piniella was promoted to general manager 
to start the 1988 season and took over as manager after the firing of Billy 
Martin on June 23. Piniella managed the Cincinnati Reds between 1990 and 
1992, a tenure that included winning the 1990 World Series in a 4 game 
sweep of the heavily favored Oakland Athletics, who were the defending 
champions. Piniella managed the Seattle Mariners for ten seasons, from 
1993 through 2002. His wife, Anita, initially insisted he not take the 
position. Lou and Anita lived in New Jersey in Allendale, and she thought 
Seattle was too far away from their family and children, and spring training 
was in Arizona instead of Florida.[17] Piniella won the AL Manager of the 
Year Award in 1995, and again in 2001, when he led the Mariners to a record-tying 
116 wins. After winning the 2001 AL Division Series, the Mariners dropped 
the first two games of the AL Championship Series, and Piniella held an 
angry post-game press conference in which he guaranteed the Mariners would 
win two out of three games in New York to return the ALCS to Seattle. However, 
the Yankees closed out the series at Yankee Stadium, and the Mariners have 
not reached the playoffs since. Following the 2002 season, Piniella requested 
out of his final year with the Mariners to manage the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.[14][18] 
As compensation, the Devil Rays traded outfielder Randy Winn to the Mariners 
for infield prospect Antonio Perez. All four of the Mariners' playoff appearances 
in team history were under Piniella. In 2014, Pinella was inducted into 
the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame on August 9. Piniella's Number 14, though 
not yet retired, had not been issued to any player or coach since his tenure 
with the Mariners concluded in 2002 until 2016 when it was issued to new 
third base coach Manny Acta. In his first two seasons with the Devil Rays, 
Piniella was able to improve the team somewhat, and they won a franchise-record 
70 games in 2004. This was also the first season in which they did not 
finish last in their division, which he also guaranteed (he also jokingly 
said, after saying it several times, "If I say it any more times I might 
have us winning the World Series!") During the 2005 season, Piniella was 
critical of the Devil Rays' front office for focusing too much on the future 
and not enough on immediate results, and for not increasing payroll quickly 
enough to field a competitive team. The Devil Rays started the season with 
a $30 million payroll, which was the lowest in the major leagues; the Yankees 
payroll in 2005 was over $208 million. Tensions eventually made Piniella 
step down as the Devil Rays' manager on September 21, 2005. Piniella had 
one more season remaining on his contract from October 2002, but agreed 
to a $2.2 million buyout, in lieu of $4.4 million that he was due, had 
he decided to manage the team for one more season. He would have also received 
$1.25 million in deferred salary from 2003. On October 16, 2006, Piniella 
agreed to a three-year contract to manage the Chicago Cubs for $10 million 
with a $5 million option for a fourth year.[19] Though Piniella's Cubs 
clinched the Central Division two years in a row, (2007–2008) and boasted 
the best record in the NL in 2008, the Cubs were swept in the postseason 
both years, first by the Arizona Diamondbacks and then the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in the 2008 NLDS. Piniella was named NL Manager of the Year for 
2008.[20][21] On July 20, 2010, Piniella announced his intention to retire 
as manager of the Cubs following the end of the season.[22] However, on 
August 22, 2010, Piniella decided to resign after that day's game, stating 
that he wanted to care for his ailing 90-year-old mother.[23] On February 
2, 2011, Piniella was hired by the San Francisco Giants as a special consultant.[24][25] 
He did not return to that position after the season.[26] On February 5, 
2016 Piniella rejoined the Cincinnati Reds as a special consultant. In 
1989, Piniella worked as a color analyst for Yankees telecasts on Madison 
Square Garden Network. After parting ways with the Devil Rays in 2006, 
Piniella spent one season as an analyst for Fox Sports, joining Thom Brennaman 
and Steve Lyons in calling postseason baseball games. During their broadcast 
of Game 3 of the 2006 American League Championship Series, Piniella was 
commenting on player Marco Scutaro who had struggled during the regular 
season but was playing well during the series. He stated that to expect 
Scutaro to continue playing well would be similar to finding a wallet on 
Friday and expecting to find another wallet on Saturday and Sunday. Piniella 
then commented that player Frank Thomas needed to get "en fuego" which 
is Spanish for "on fire", because he was "frio" meaning "cold". Lyons responded 
by saying that Piniella was "hablaing [sic] Español" and added, "I still 
can't find my wallet. I don't understand him, and I don't want to sit close 
to him now."[28] Fox fired Lyons for making the above remarks, which they 
determined to be racially insensitive.[29] Piniella later defended Lyons 
saying Lyons was "a man" and that "There isn't a racist bone in his [Lyons'] 
body. Not one. I've known the guy personally. He was kidding with me, nothing 
more and nothing less."[30] On February 22, 2012, it was announced Piniella 
would join the YES Network as an analyst for Yankees games. He made his 
YES debut on March 4 during a Yankees-Phillies spring training game.[26][31] 
Piniella made a cameo appearance in the 1994 film Little Big League. In 
late 2007, Piniella appeared in a television commercial for Aquafina bottled 
water in which he parodies his famous June 2, 2007 meltdown at Wrigley 
Field. Piniella and Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén appeared in 
one commercial to advertise a local car dealership during the first half 
of the 2008 Crosstown series. The creators of the commercial used their 
likeness in three other commercials, which featured stunt doubles riding 
bicycles and jumping rope.[32] In 2009, Piniella did a commercial for DirecTV.
