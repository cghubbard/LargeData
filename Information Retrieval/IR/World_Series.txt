The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball 
(MLB) in North America, contested since 1903 between the American League 
(AL) champion team and the National League (NL) champion team. The winner 
of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven 
playoff, and the winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy.[1] 
As the series is played in October (and occasionally November), during 
the autumn season in North America, it is often referred to as the Fall 
Classic.[2] Prior to 1969, the team with the best regular season win-loss 
record in each league automatically advanced to the World Series; since 
then each league has conducted a championship series (ALCS and NLCS) preceding 
the World Series to determine which teams will advance. As of 2016, the 
World Series has been contested 112 times, with the AL winning 64 and the 
NL winning 48. The 2016 World Series took place between the Cleveland Indians 
and the Chicago Cubs. Seven games were played, with the Cubs victorious 
after game seven, played in Cleveland. The final score was 8–7; the game 
went into extra innings after a tied score of 6–6. This was the third World 
Series won by the Cubs, as well as their first title since 1908, a period 
of 108 years. In the American League, the New York Yankees have played 
in 40 World Series and won 27, the Philadelphia/Kansas City/Oakland Athletics 
have played in 14 and won 9, and the Boston Red Sox have played in 12 and 
won 8, including the first World Series. In the National League, the St. 
Louis Cardinals have appeared in 19 and won 11, the New York/San Francisco 
Giants have played in 20 and won 8, the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers have 
appeared in 18 and won 6, and the Cincinnati Reds have appeared in 9 and 
won 5. As of 2016, no team has won consecutive World Series championships 
since the New York Yankees in 1999 and 2000, the longest such duration 
in Major League Baseball history. Until the formation of the American Association 
in 1882 as a second major league, the National Association of Professional 
Base Ball Players (1871–1875) and then the National League (founded 1876) 
represented the top level of organized baseball in the United States. All 
championships were awarded to the team with the best record at the end 
of the season, without a postseason series being played. From 1884 to 1890, 
the National League and the American Association faced each other in a 
series of games at the end of the season to determine an overall champion. 
These series were disorganized in comparison to the modern World Series, 
with the terms arranged through negotiation of the owners of the championship 
teams beforehand. The number of games played ranged from as few as three 
in 1884 (Providence defeated New York three games to zero), to a high of 
fifteen in 1887 (Detroit beat St. Louis ten games to five). Both the 1885 
and 1890 Series ended in ties, each team having won three games with one 
tie game.[3] The series was promoted and referred to as "The Championship 
of the United States",[4][5] "World's Championship Series", or "World's 
Series" for short. In his book Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded: August 
27, 1883, Simon Winchester mentions in passing that the World Series was 
named for the New York World newspaper,[6] but this view is disputed.[7] 
The 19th-century competitions are, however, not officially recognized as 
part of World Series history by Major League Baseball, as it considers 
19th-century baseball to be a prologue to the modern baseball era.[8] Until 
about 1960, some sources treated the 19th-century Series on an equal basis 
with the post-19th-century series.[9] After about 1930, however, many authorities 
list the start of the World Series in 1903 and discuss the earlier contests 
separately.[10] (For example, the 1929 World Almanac and Book of Facts 
lists "Baseball's World Championships 1884–1928" in a single table,[11] 
but the 1943 edition lists "Baseball World Championships 1903–1942".[12]) 
Following the collapse of the American Association after the 1891 season, 
the National League was again the only major league. The league championship 
was awarded in 1892 by a playoff between half-season champions. This scheme 
was abandoned after one season.[13] Beginning in 1893—and continuing until 
divisional play was introduced in 1969—the pennant was awarded to the first-place 
club in the standings at the end of the season. For four seasons, 1894–1897, 
the league champions played the runners-up in the post season championship 
series called the Temple Cup.[14][15] A second attempt at this format was 
the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup series, which was played only once, in 1900.[16] 
In 1901, the American League was formed as a second major league. No championship 
series were played in 1901 or 1902 as the National and American Leagues 
fought each other for business supremacy (in 1902, the top teams instead 
opted to compete in a football championship). After two years of bitter 
competition and player raiding (in 1902, the AL and NL champions even went 
so far as to challenge each other to a tournament in football after the 
end of the baseball season), the National and American Leagues made peace 
and, as part of the accord, several pairs of teams squared off for interleague 
exhibition games after the 1903 season. These series were arranged by the 
participating clubs, as the 1880s World's Series matches had been. One 
of them matched the two pennant winners, Pittsburg Pirates of the NL and 
Boston Americans (later known as the Red Sox) of the AL; that one is known 
as the 1903 World Series. It had been arranged well in advance by the two 
owners, as both teams were league leaders by large margins.[17] Boston 
upset Pittsburg by five games to three, winning with pitching depth behind 
Cy Young and Bill Dinneen and with the support of the band of Royal Rooters. 
The Series brought much civic pride to Boston and proved the new American 
League could beat the Nationals.[citation needed] The 1904 Series, if it 
had been held, would have been between the AL's Boston Americans (Boston 
Red Sox) and the NL's New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants). At 
that point there was no governing body for the World Series nor any requirement 
that a Series be played. Thus the Giants' owner, John T. Brush, refused 
to allow his team to participate in such an event, citing the "inferiority" 
of the upstart American League. John McGraw, the Giants' manager, even 
went so far as to say that his Giants were already "world champions" since 
they were the champions of the "only real major league". At the time of 
the announcement, their new cross-town rivals, the New York Highlanders 
(now the New York Yankees), were leading the AL, and the prospect of facing 
the Highlanders did not please Giants management. Boston won on the last 
day of the season, and the leagues had previously agreed to hold a World's 
Championship Series in 1904, but it was not binding, and Brush stuck to 
his original decision. In addition to political reasons, Brush also factually 
cited the lack of rules under which money would be split, where games would 
be played, and how they would be operated and staffed. During the winter 
of 1904–1905, however, feeling the sting of press criticism, Brush had 
a change of heart and proposed what came to be known as the "Brush Rules", 
under which the series were played subsequently. One rule was that player 
shares would come from a portion of the gate receipts for the first four 
games only. This was to discourage teams from "fixing" early games in order 
to prolong the series and make more money. Receipts for later games would 
be split among the two clubs and the National Commission, the governing 
body for the sport, which was able to cover much of its annual operating 
expense from World Series revenue. Most importantly, the now-official and 
compulsory World's Series matches were operated strictly by the National 
Commission itself, not by the participating clubs. With the new rules in 
place and the National Commission in control, McGraw's Giants made it to 
the 1905 Series, and beat the Philadelphia A's four games to one. The Series 
was subsequently held annually, until 1994, when it was canceled due to 
a players' strike. The list of postseason rules evolved over time. In 1925, 
Brooklyn owner Charles Ebbets persuaded others to adopt as a permanent 
rule the 2–3–2 pattern used in 1924. Prior to 1924, the pattern had been 
to alternate by game or to make another arrangement convenient to both 
clubs. The 2–3–2 pattern has been used ever since save for the 1943 and 
1945 World Series, which followed a 3–4 pattern due to World War II travel 
restrictions; in 1944, the normal pattern was followed because both teams 
were based in the same home stadium. Gambling and game-fixing had been 
a problem in professional baseball from the beginning; star pitcher Jim 
Devlin was banned for life in 1877, when the National League was just two 
years old. Baseball's gambling problems came to a head in 1919, when eight 
players of the Chicago White Sox were alleged to have conspired to throw 
the 1919 World Series. The Sox had won the Series in 1917 and were heavy 
favorites to beat the Cincinnati Reds in 1919, but first baseman Chick 
Gandil had other plans. Gandil, in collaboration with gambler Joseph "Sport" 
Sullivan, approached his teammates and got six of them to agree to throw 
the Series: starting pitchers Eddie Cicotte and Lefty Williams, shortstop 
Swede Risberg, left fielder Shoeless Joe Jackson, center fielder Happy 
Felsch, and utility infielder Fred McMullin. Third baseman Buck Weaver 
knew of the fix but declined to participate, hitting .324 for the series 
from 11 hits and committing no errors in the field. The Sox, who were promised 
$100,000 for cooperating, proceeded to lose the Series in eight games, 
pitching poorly, hitting poorly and making many errors. Though he took 
the money, Jackson insisted to his death that he played to the best of 
his ability in the series (he was the best hitter in the series, including 
having hit the series' only home run, but had markedly worse numbers in 
the games the White Sox lost). During the Series, writer and humorist Ring 
Lardner had facetiously called the event the "World's Serious". The Series 
turned out to indeed have serious consequences for the sport. After rumors 
circulated for nearly a year, the players were suspended in September 1920. 
The "Black Sox" were acquitted in a criminal conspiracy trial. However, 
baseball in the meantime had established the office of Commissioner in 
an effort to protect the game's integrity, and the first commissioner, 
Kenesaw Mountain Landis, banned all of the players involved, including 
Weaver, for life. The White Sox would not win a World Series again until 
2005. The events of the 1919 Series, segueing into the "live ball" era, 
marked a point in time of change of the fortunes of several teams. The 
two most prolific World Series winners to date, the New York Yankees and 
the St. Louis Cardinals, did not win their first championship until the 
1920s; and three of the teams that were highly successful prior to 1920 
(the Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Cubs) went the rest 
of the 20th century without another World Series win. The Red Sox and White 
Sox finally won again in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The Cubs had to wait 
over a century (until the 2016 season) for their next trophy. They did 
not appear in the Fall Classic from 1945 until 2016, the longest drought 
of any MLB club. The New York Yankees purchased Babe Ruth from the Boston 
Red Sox after the 1919 season, appeared in their first World Series two 
years later in 1921, and became frequent participants thereafter. Over 
a period of 45 years from 1920 to 1964, the Yankees played in 29 World 
Series championships, winning 20. The team's dynasty reached its apex between 
1947 and 1964, when the Yankees reached the World Series 15 times in eighteen 
years, helped by an agreement with the Kansas City Athletics (after that 
team moved from Philadelphia during 1954–1955 offseason) whereby the teams 
made several deals advantageous to the Yankees (until ended by new Athletics' 
owner Charles O. Finley). During that span, the Yankees played in all World 
Series except 1948, 1954, and 1959, winning ten. From 1949 to 1953, the 
Yankees won the World Series five years in a row; from 1936–1939 the Yankees 
won four World Series Championships in a row. There are only two other 
occasions when a team has won at least three consecutive World Series: 
1972 to 1974 by the Oakland Athletics, and 1998 to 2000 by the New York 
Yankees. In an 18-year span from 1947 to 1964, except for 1948 and 1959, 
the World Series was played in New York City, featuring at least one of 
the three teams located in New York at the time. The Dodgers and Giants 
moved to California after the 1957 season, leaving the Yankees as the lone 
team in the city until the Mets were enfranchised in 1962. During this 
period, other than 1948, 1954, and 1959, the Yankees represented the American 
League in the World Series. In the years 1947, 1949, 1951–1953, and 1955–1956, 
both teams in the World Series were from New York, with the Yankees playing 
against either the Dodgers or Giants. In 1958, the Brooklyn Dodgers and 
New York Giants took their long-time rivalry to the west coast, moving 
to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively, bringing Major League Baseball 
west of St. Louis and Kansas City. The Dodgers were the first of the two 
clubs to contest a World Series on the west coast, defeating the Chicago 
White Sox in 1959. The 1962 Giants made the first California World Series 
appearance of that franchise, losing to the Yankees. The Dodgers made three 
World Series appearances in the 1960s: a 1963 win over the Yankees, a 1965 
win over the Minnesota Twins and a 1966 loss to the Baltimore Orioles. 
In 1968, the Kansas City Athletics relocated to Oakland and the following 
year 1969, the National League granted a franchise to San Diego as the 
San Diego Padres. The A's became a powerful dynasty, winning three consecutive 
World Series from 1972–1974. In 1974, the A's played the Dodgers in the 
first all-California World Series. The Padres have two World Series appearances 
(a 1984 loss to the Detroit Tigers, and a 1998 loss to the New York Yankees). 
The Dodgers won two more World Series in the 1980s (1981, 1988). The A's 
again went to three straight world series, from 1988–1990, winning once. 
1988 and 1989 were all-California series as the A's lost to the Dodgers 
and beat the Giants, respectively. The Giants have been in four World Series' 
in the new millennium, losing in 2002 to the Anaheim Angels (the most-recent 
all-California series), and winning in 2010 (Rangers), 2012 (Tigers), and 
2014 (Royals). Prior to 1969, the National League and the American League 
each crowned its champion (the "pennant winner") based on the best win-loss 
record at the end of the regular season. A structured playoff series began 
in 1969, when both the National and American Leagues were reorganized into 
two divisions each, East and West. The two division winners within each 
league played each other in a best-of-five League Championship Series to 
determine who would advance to the World Series. In 1985, the format changed 
to best-of-seven. The National League Championship Series (NLCS) and American 
League Championship Series (ALCS), since the expansion to best-of-seven, 
are always played in a 2–3–2 format: Games 1, 2, 6 and 7 are played in 
the stadium of the team that has home-field advantage, and Games 3, 4 and 
5 are played in the stadium of the team that does not. MLB night games 
started being held in 1935 by the Cincinnati Reds, but the World Series 
remained a strictly daytime event for years thereafter. In the final game 
of the 1949 World Series, a Series game was finished under lights for the 
first time. The first scheduled night World Series game was Game 4 of the 
1971 World Series at Three Rivers Stadium.[18] Afterward, World Series 
games were frequently scheduled at night, when television audiences were 
larger. Game 6 of the 1987 World Series was the last World Series game 
played in the daytime,[19] indoors at the Metrodome in Minnesota. (The 
last World Series played outdoors during the day was the final game of 
the 1984 series in Detroit's Tiger Stadium.) During this seven-year period, 
only three teams won the World Series: the Oakland Athletics from 1972 
to 1974, Cincinnati Reds in 1975 and 1976, and New York Yankees in 1977 
and 1978. This is the only time in World Series history in which three 
teams have won consecutive series in succession. This period was book-ended 
by World Championships for the Pittsburgh Pirates, in 1971 and 1979. However, 
the Baltimore Orioles made three consecutive World Series appearances: 
1969 (losing to the "amazing" eight-year-old franchise New York Mets), 
1970 (beating the Reds in their first World Series appearance of the decade), 
and 1971 (losing to the Pittsburgh Pirates, as well their 1979 appearance, 
when they again lost to the Pirates), and the Los Angeles Dodgers' back-to-back 
World Series appearances in 1977 and 1978 (both losses to the New York 
Yankees), as well in 1974 losing against the cross-state rival Oakland 
Athletics. Game 6 of the 1975 World Series is regarded by most as one of 
the greatest World Series games ever played. It found the Boston Red Sox 
winning in the 12th inning in Fenway Park, defeating the Cincinnati Reds 
to force a seventh and deciding game. The game is best remembered for its 
exciting lead changes, nail-biting turns of events, and a game-winning 
walk-off home run by Carlton Fisk, resulting in a 7–6 Red Sox victory. 
The National and American Leagues operated under essentially identical 
rules until 1973, when the American League adopted the designated hitter 
(DH) rule, allowing its teams to use another hitter to bat in place of 
the (usually) weak-hitting pitcher. The National League did not adopt the 
DH rule. This presented a problem for the World Series, whose two contestants 
would now be playing their regular-season games under different rules. 
From 1973 to 1975, the World Series did not include a DH. Starting in 1976, 
the World Series allowed for the use of a DH in even-numbered years only. 
(The Cincinnati Reds swept the 1976 Series in four games, using the same 
nine-man lineup in each contest. Dan Driessen was the Reds' DH during the 
series, thereby becoming the National League's first designated hitter.) 
Finally, in 1986, baseball adopted the current rule in which the DH is 
used for World Series games played in the AL champion's park but not the 
NL champion's. Thus, the DH rule's use or non-use can affect the performance 
of the home team. The 1984 Detroit Tigers gained distinction as just the 
third team in major league history (after the 1927 New York Yankees and 
1955 Brooklyn Dodgers) to lead a season wire-to-wire, from opening day 
through their World Series victory.[20] In the process, Tigers skipper 
Sparky Anderson became the first manager to win a World Series title in 
both leagues, having previously won in 1975 and 1976 with the Cincinnati 
Reds. The 1988 World Series is remembered for the iconic home run by the 
Los Angeles Dodgers' Kirk Gibson with two outs in the bottom of the ninth 
inning. The Dodgers were huge underdogs against the 104-win Oakland Athletics, 
who had swept the Boston Red Sox in the ALCS. Baseball's top relief pitcher, 
Dennis Eckersley, closed out all four games in the ALCS, and he appeared 
ready to do the same in Game 1 against a Dodgers team trailing 4-3 in the 
ninth. After getting the first two outs, Eckersley walked Mike Davis of 
the Dodgers, who were playing without Gibson, their best position player 
and the NL MVP. Gibson had injured himself in the NLCS and was expected 
to miss the entire World Series. Yet, despite not being able to walk without 
a noticeable limp, Gibson surprised all in attendance at Dodger Stadium 
(and all watching on TV) by pinch-hitting. After two quick strikes and 
then working the count full, Gibson hit a home run to right, inspiring 
iconic pronouncements by two legendary broadcasters calling the game, Vin 
Scully (on TV) and Jack Buck (on radio). On NBC, as Gibson limped around 
the bases, Scully famously exclaimed, "the impossible has happened!" and 
on radio, Buck equally famously exclaimed, "I don't believe what I just 
saw!" Gibson's home run set the tone for the series, as the Dodgers went 
on to beat the A's 4 games to 1. The severity of Gibson's injury prevented 
him from playing in any of the remaining games. When the 1989 World Series 
began, it was notable chiefly for being the first ever World Series matchup 
between the two San Francisco Bay Area teams, the San Francisco Giants 
and Oakland Athletics. Oakland won the first two games at home, and the 
two teams crossed the bridge to San Francisco to play Game 3 on Tuesday, 
October 17. ABC's broadcast of Game 3 began at 5 pm local time, approximately 
30 minutes before the first pitch was scheduled. At 5:04, while broadcasters 
Al Michaels and Tim McCarver were narrating highlights and the teams were 
warming up, the Loma Prieta earthquake occurred (having a surface-wave 
magnitude of 7.1 with an epicenter ten miles (16 km) northeast of Santa 
Cruz, California). The earthquake caused substantial property and economic 
damage in the Bay Area and killed 63 people. Television viewers saw the 
video signal deteriorate and heard Michaels say "I'll tell you what, we're 
having an earth--" before the feed from Candlestick Park was lost. Fans 
filing into the stadium saw Candlestick sway visibly during the quake. 
Television coverage later resumed, using backup generators, with Michaels 
becoming a news reporter on the unfolding disaster. Approximately 30 minutes 
after the earthquake, Commissioner Fay Vincent ordered the game to be postponed. 
Fans, workers, and the teams evacuated a blacked out (although still sunlit) 
Candlestick. Game 3 was finally played on October 27, and Oakland won that 
day and the next to complete a four-game sweep. World Series games were 
contested outside of the United States for the first time in 1992, with 
the Toronto Blue Jays defeating the Atlanta Braves in six games. The World 
Series returned to Canada in 1993, with the Blue Jays victorious again, 
this time against the Philadelphia Phillies in six games. No other Series 
has featured a team from outside of the United States. Toronto is the only 
expansion team to win successive World Series titles. The 1993 World Series 
was also notable for being only the second championship concluded by a 
home run and the first concluded by a come-from-behind homer, after Joe 
Carter's three-run shot in the bottom of the ninth inning sealed an 8–6 
Toronto win in Game 6. The first Series to end with a homer was the 1960 
World Series, when Bill Mazeroski hit a ninth-inning solo shot in Game 
7 to win the championship for the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1994, each league 
was restructured into three divisions, with the three division winners 
and the newly introduced wild card winner advancing to a best-of-five playoff 
round (the "division series"), the National League Division Series (NLDS) 
and American League Division Series (ALDS). The team with the best league 
record is matched against the wild card team, unless they are in the same 
division, in which case, the team with the second-best record plays against 
the wild card winner. The remaining two division winners are pitted against 
each other. The winners of the series in the first round advance to the 
best-of-seven NLCS and ALCS. Due to a players' strike, however, the NLDS 
and ALDS were not played until 1995. Beginning in 1998, home field advantage 
was given to the team with the better regular season record, with the exception 
that the Wild Card team cannot get home-field advantage. After the boycott 
of 1904, the World Series was played every year until 1994 despite World 
War I, the global influenza pandemic of 1918–1919, the Great Depression 
of the 1930s, America's involvement in World War II, and even an earthquake 
in the host cities of the 1989 World Series. A breakdown in collective 
bargaining led to a strike in August 1994 and the eventual cancellation 
of the rest of the season, including the playoffs. As the labor talks began, 
baseball franchise owners demanded a salary cap in order to limit payrolls, 
the elimination of salary arbitration, and the right to retain free agent 
players by matching a competitor's best offer.[citation needed] The Major 
League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) refused to agree to limit payrolls, 
noting that the responsibility for high payrolls lay with those owners 
who were voluntarily offering contracts. One difficulty in reaching a settlement 
was the absence of a commissioner.[citation needed] When Fay Vincent was 
forced to resign in 1992, owners did not replace him, electing instead 
to make Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig acting commissioner. Thus the 
commissioner, responsible for ensuring the integrity and protecting the 
welfare of the game, was an interested party rather than a neutral arbiter, 
and baseball headed into the 1994 work stoppage without an independent 
commissioner for the first time since the office was founded in 1920.[citation 
needed] The previous collective bargaining agreement expired on December 
31, 1993, and baseball began the 1994 season without a new agreement. Owners 
and players negotiated as the season progressed, but owners refused to 
give up the idea of a salary cap and players refused to accept one. On 
August 12, 1994, the players went on strike. After a month passed with 
no progress in the labor talks, Selig canceled the rest of the 1994 season 
and the postseason on September 14. The World Series was not played for 
the first time in 90 years. The Montreal Expos, now the Washington Nationals, 
were the best team in baseball at the time of the stoppage, with a record 
of 74–40 (since their founding in 1969, the Expos/Nationals have never 
played in a World Series.) The labor dispute lasted into the spring of 
1995, with owners beginning spring training with replacement players. However, 
the MLBPA returned to work on April 2, 1995 after a federal judge, future 
U.S. Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor, ruled that the owners had engaged 
in unfair labor practices.[citation needed] The season started on April 
25 and the 1995 World Series was played as scheduled, with Atlanta beating 
Cleveland four games to two. With the 2006 World Series victory by the 
St. Louis Cardinals, Tony La Russa became the second manager to a win a 
World Series in both the American and National Leagues. Prior to 2003, 
home-field advantage in the World Series alternated from year to year between 
the NL and AL. After the 2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game ended 
in a tie, MLB decided to award home-field advantage in the World Series 
to the winner of the All-Star Game. Originally implemented as a two-year 
trial from 2003 to 2004, the practice has been extended indefinitely. The 
American League won every All-Star Game since this change until 2010 and 
thus enjoyed home-field advantage from 2002, when it also had home-field 
advantage based on the alternating schedule, through 2009. From 2003 to 
2010, the AL and NL had each won the World Series four times, but none 
of them had gone the full seven games. Since then, the 2011, 2014, and 
2016 World Series have gone the full seven games. This rule is subject 
to debate, with various writers feeling that home-field advantage should 
be decided based on the regular season records of the participants, not 
on an exhibition game played several months earlier.[21][22] Some writers 
especially questioned the integrity of this rule after the 2014 All-Star 
Game, when St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright suggested that he 
intentionally gave Derek Jeter some easy pitches to hit in the New York 
Yankees' shortstop's final All-Star appearance before he retired at the 
end of that season.[23][24] As Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote in July 
2015 about the rule: "So now we have a game that's not real baseball determining 
which league hosts Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 in the World Series. It's not a 
game if pitchers throw one inning. It's not a game if managers try to get 
everyone on a bloated roster into the game. It's not a game if every franchise, 
no matter how wretched, has to put a player on the team ... If the game 
is going to count, tell the managers to channel their inner Connie Mack 
and go for it."[25] However, within the last seven seasons, home-field 
advantage, in terms of deciding World Series games, has not necessarily 
worked for teams of said games. Since 2014, the home team has not won the 
deciding game of a World Series. The San Francisco Giants won the World 
Series in 2010, 2012, and 2014 while failing to make the playoffs in the 
intervening years. The Texas Rangers were twice only one strike away from 
winning their first World Series title in 2011, but both times the St. 
Louis Cardinals scored late to win Game 6 and Game 7. In 2016, the Chicago 
Cubs ended their 108 year long drought without a World Series title by 
defeating the Cleveland Indians, rallying from a 3-1 series deficit in 
the process. American League (AL) teams have won 64 of the 112 World Series 
played (57%). The New York Yankees have won 27 titles, accounting for 24% 
of all series played and 42% of the wins by American League teams. The 
St. Louis Cardinals have won 11 World Series, accounting for 10% of all 
series played and 23% of the 48 National League victories. At least one 
New York team has been in 54 World Series (48%) of Series played. When 
the first modern World Series was played in 1903, there were eight teams 
in each league. These 16 franchises, all of which are still in existence, 
have each won at least two World Series titles. The number of teams was 
unchanged until 1961, with fourteen "expansion teams" joining MLB since 
then. Twelve have played in a World Series (the Mariners and Expos/Nationals 
being the two exceptions). The expansion teams have won ten of the 22 Series 
(45%) in which they have played, which is 9% of all 112 series played since 
1903. In 2015, the first World Series featuring only expansion teams was 
played between the Kansas City Royals and New York Mets.[26] This information 
is up to date through the present time: When two teams share the same state 
or metropolitan area, fans often develop strong loyalties to one and antipathies 
towards the other, sometimes building on already-existing rivalries between 
cities or neighborhoods. Before the introduction of interleague play in 
1997, the only opportunity for two teams in different leagues to face each 
other in official competition would have been in a World Series. The first 
city to host an entire World Series is Chicago in 1906, when the Chicago 
White Sox beat the Chicago Cubs in six games. Fourteen "Subway Series" 
have been played entirely within New York City, all including the American 
League's New York Yankees. Thirteen of them matched the Yankees with either 
the New York Giants or the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National League. The 
initial instances occurred in 1921 and 1922, when the Giants beat the Yankees 
in consecutive World Series that were not technically "subway series" since 
the teams shared the Polo Grounds as their home ballpark. The last Subway 
Series involving the original New York ballclubs came in 1956, when the 
Yankees beat the Dodgers. The trio was separated in 1958 when the Dodgers 
and Giants moved to California, and an all-NY Series did not recur until 
2000, when the Yankees defeated the New York Mets in five games. The last 
World Series played entirely in one ballpark was the 1944 "Streetcar Series" 
between the St. Louis Cardinals and the St. Louis Browns. The Cardinals 
won in six games, all held in their shared home, Sportsman's Park. The 
1989 World Series, sometimes called the "Bay Bridge Series" or the "BART 
Series" (after the connecting transit line), featured the Oakland Athletics 
and the San Francisco Giants, teams that play just across San Francisco 
Bay from each other. The series is most remembered for the major earthquake 
that struck the San Francisco Bay Area just before game 3 was scheduled 
to begin. The quake caused significant damage to both communities and severed 
the Bay Bridge that connects them, forcing the postponement of the series. 
Play resumed ten days later, and the A's swept the Giants in four games. 
The historic rivalry between Northern and Southern California added to 
the interest in the Oakland Athletics-Los Angeles Dodgers series in 1974 
and 1988 and in the San Francisco Giants' series against the then-Anaheim 
Angels in 2002. Other than the St. Louis World Series of 1944, the only 
postseason tournament held entirely within Missouri was the I-70 Series 
in 1985 (named for the Interstate Highway connecting the two cities) between 
the St. Louis Cardinals and the Kansas City Royals, who won at home in 
the seventh game. As of 2016, there has never been an in-state World Series 
between the teams in Ohio (Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds), Florida 
(Tampa Bay Rays and Florida Marlins), Texas (Texas Rangers and Houston 
Astros - who now both play in the American League since the Astros changed 
leagues in 2013, making any future joint World Series appearance an impossibility 
unless one of the teams switches leagues) or Pennsylvania (the Philadelphia 
Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates have been traditional National League 
rivals going back to the late 19th Century). Neither the Phillies nor the 
Pirates ever faced the Athletics in October during the latter team's tenure 
in Philadelphia, through 1954. The Boston Red Sox never similarly faced 
the Braves while the latter team played in Boston through 1952. There also 
was never an all-Canada World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and 
the former Montreal Expos, who never won a National League pennant when 
they played in that Canadian city from 1969 through 2004. The Expos became 
the Washington Nationals in 2005 - raising the possibility of a potential 
future "I-95 World Series" between the National League team and the AL's 
Baltimore Orioles, who play just 50 miles to the north of Washington. Finally, 
the Los Angeles Angels have never faced off in October against either the 
Dodgers or against the San Diego Padres for bragging rights in Southern 
California, although all three of those teams have appeared in a World 
Series. At the time the first modern World Series began in 1903, each league 
had eight clubs, all of which survive today (although sometimes in a different 
city or with a new nickname), comprising the "original sixteen". When the 
World Series was first broadcast on television in 1947, it was only televised 
to a few surrounding areas via coaxial inter-connected stations: New York 
City; Philadelphia; Schenectady/Albany, New York; Washington, D.C. and 
surrounding suburbs/environs. In 1948,[31] games in Boston were only seen 
in the Northeast. Meanwhile, games in Cleveland were only seen in the Midwest 
and Pittsburgh. The games were open to all channels with a network affiliation.[32][33] 
In all, the 1948 World Series was televised to fans in seven Midwestern 
cities: Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Toledo. 
By 1949, World Series games could now be seen east of the Mississippi River.[34] 
The games were open to all channels with a network affiliation.[35] By 
1950, World Series games could be seen in most of the country,[36][37][37][38] 
but not all. 1951 marked the first time that the World Series was televised 
coast[39] to coast.[31][40][41] Meanwhile, 1955 marked the first time that 
the World Series was televised in color.[42][43] ^ *: Not currently broadcasting 
Major League Baseball. ^ **: Per the current broadcast agreement, the World 
Series will be televised by Fox through 2021.[44] ^ ***: Gillette,[45] 
which sponsored World Series telecasts exclusively from roughly 1947 to 
1965 (prior to 1966, the Series announcers were chosen by the Gillette 
Company along with the Commissioner of Baseball and NBC), paid for airtime 
on DuMont's owned-and-operated Pittsburgh affiliate, WDTV (now KDKA-TV) 
to air the World Series. In the meantime, Gillette also bought airtime 
on ABC, CBS, and NBC. More to the point, in some cities, the World Series 
was broadcast on three different stations at once. ^ ****: NBC was originally 
scheduled to televise the entire 1995 World Series; however, due to the 
cancellation of the 1994 Series (which had been slated for ABC, who last 
televised a World Series in 1989), coverage ended up being split between 
the two networks. Game 5 is, to date, the last Major League Baseball game 
to be telecast by ABC (had there been a Game 7, ABC would've televised 
it). This was the only World Series to be produced under the "Baseball 
Network" umbrella (a revenue sharing joint venture between Major League 
Baseball, ABC, and NBC). In July 1995, both networks announced that they 
would be pulling out of what was supposed to be a six-year-long venture. 
NBC would next cover the 1997 (NBC's first entirely since 1988) and 1999 
World Series over the course of a five-year-long contract, in which Fox 
would cover the World Series in even numbered years (1996, 1998, and 2000). 
Despite its name, the World Series remains solely the championship of the 
major-league baseball teams in the United States and Canada, although MLB, 
its players, and North American media sometimes informally refer to World 
Series winners as "world champions of baseball".[46] The United States, 
Canada, and Mexico (Liga Méxicana de Béisbol, established 1925) were the 
only professional baseball countries until a few decades into the 20th 
century. The first Japanese professional baseball efforts began in 1920. 
The current Japanese leagues date from the late 1940s (after World War 
II). Various Latin American leagues also formed around that time. By the 
1990s, baseball was played at a highly skilled level in many countries. 
Reaching North America's high-salary major leagues is the goal of many 
of the best players around the world, which gives a strong international 
flavor to the Series. Many talented players from Latin America, the Caribbean, 
the Pacific Rim, and elsewhere now play in the majors. One notable exception 
is Cuban citizens, because of the political tensions between the US and 
Cuba since 1959 (yet a number of Cuba's finest ballplayers have still managed 
to defect to the United States over the past half-century to play in the 
American professional leagues). Japanese professional players also have 
a difficult time coming to the North American leagues. They become free 
agents only after nine years playing service in the NPB, although their 
Japanese teams may at any time "post" them for bids from MLB teams, which 
commonly happens at the player's request. Several tournaments feature teams 
composed only of players from one country, similar to national teams in 
other sports. The World Baseball Classic, sponsored by Major League Baseball 
and sanctioned by the sport's world governing body, the World Baseball 
Softball Confederation (WBSC), uses a format similar to the FIFA World 
Cup to promote competition between nations every four years. The WBSC has 
since added the Premier12, a tournament also involving national teams; 
the first event was held in 2015, and is planned to be held every four 
years (in the middle of the World Baseball Classic cycle). The World Baseball 
Classic is held in March and the Premier12 is held in November, allowing 
both events to feature top-level players from all nations. The predecessor 
to the WBSC as the sport's international governing body, the International 
Baseball Federation, also sponsored a Baseball World Cup to crown a world 
champion. However, because the World Cup was held during the Northern Hemisphere 
summer, during the playing season of almost all top-level leagues, its 
teams did not feature the best talent from each nation. As a result, baseball 
fans paid little or no attention to the World Cup and generally disregarded 
its results. The Caribbean Series features competition among the league 
champions from Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela 
but unlike the FIFA Club World Cup, there is no club competition that features 
champions from all professional leagues across the world. Rooftop view
