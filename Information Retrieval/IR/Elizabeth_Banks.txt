On television, Banks had a recurring role as Avery Jessup on the NBC sitcom

Box Office Mojo ranked Banks as the 32nd highest-grossing actor of all 
time, and the sixth highest-grossing female actor.[7] Banks was born in 
Pittsfield, Massachusetts and grew up on Brown Street, the eldest of four 
children of Ann (née Wallace) and Mark P. Mitchell.[8] Her father, a Vietnam 
veteran, was a factory worker for General Electric and her mother worked 
in a bank.[9] She has said that she grew up "Irish + WASP + Catholic".[10] 
Growing up, Banks played baseball and rode horses. She was in Little League

In 1998, she completed schooling at the American Conservatory Theater in 
San Francisco, California, where she earned an MFA.[14][15] Banks changed 
her name to avoid confusion with actress Elizabeth Mitchell.[16] After 
auditioning in New York, she was offered a role on the soap opera Santa 
Barbara. Taking the role would have required her to quit her education 
at the American Conservatory Theatre, and Banks ultimately decided to forgo 
the offer due to having taken out student loans to complete her degree.[17] 
She made her acting debut in the 1998 independent film Surrender Dorothy, 
as Elizabeth Casey, and appeared in various films over the next seven years 
including Guy Ritchie's Swept Away[18] before gaining more prominent widespread 
exposure through the 2005 comedy film The 40-Year-Old Virgin.[19] In August 
2005, at the Williamstown Theatre Festival, Banks starred in William Inge's 
Bus Stop as Cherie, the sexy, blonde, aspiring nightclub singer.[20] Jeffrey 
Borak wrote that Banks' portrayal was acted "with poise, clarity and a 
shrewd feel for Cherie's complexities. Her performance is all of a piece 
and in harmony, stylistically, with the performances around her..."[21] 
In 2005, she appeared on the series Stella, and in May 2006, she had a 
role in the season five finale of the NBC sitcom Scrubs as Dr. Kim Briggs,

The film was about an intrusive stepmother who makes life miserable for 
the teen daughters of her new husband. Banks based her character, Rachel, 
on Rebecca De Mornay's character in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.[28] 
"It was very important to me that every line reading I gave could be interpreted 
two ways," says Banks of her role, "So that when you go back through the 
movie you can see that".[28] Banks is a frequent co-star of actor Paul 
Rudd, the two having appeared in five films together to date (Wet Hot American 
Summer, The Baxter, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Role Models, and Our Idiot 
Brother).[29] She is also a frequent co-star of actor Tobey Maguire, the 
two having also appeared in five films together (Spider-Man, Seabiscuit, 
Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3, and The Details).[30] Banks was cast as a love 
interest for Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) in the fourth season of the Emmy 
Award-winning sitcom 30 Rock.[31] Intended to appear in four episodes in 
2010, Banks went on to become a recurring character with 13 appearances 
by the end of the fifth season, including her marriage in the episode Mrs. 
Donaghy. Her performance in season five earned her a nomination for Primetime

Banks co-starred in the 2014 movie Every Secret Thing, playing Detective

6, 1992. They were married in 2003.[43] She and her husband had their first 
child, Felix, who was born through a surrogate in March 2011.[44] In November 
2012, Banks announced the birth of another son, Magnus Mitchell, also by 
surrogate.[45] Banks went through parts of the process of conversion to 
Judaism, her husband's faith, and studied with rabbis. In 2013, speaking 
of her religion, she stated that she practices Judaism, though "I did not 
have my mikveh, so technically I'm not converted", but that she has "been 
essentially a Jew for like 15 years", adding "Frankly, because I'm already 
doing everything [practicing religious rituals], I feel like I'm as Jewish 
as I'm ever going to be".[1][46] Banks was a vocal supporter of Hillary 
Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign,[47] involved in a rendition of Rachel 
Platten's single "Fight Song" with a host of other celebrities at the Democratic
