William Anthony Hallahan (August 4, 1902 – July 8, 1981) was an American 
left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball during the 1920s and 1930s. 
Nicknamed "Wild Bill" because of his lack of control on the mound — he 
twice led the National League in bases on balls — Hallahan nevertheless 
was one of the pitching stars of the 1931 World Series and pitched his 
finest in postseason competition. He also was the starting pitcher for 
the National League in the first All-Star Game in 1933, losing a 4–2 decision 
to Lefty Gomez of the American League and surrendering a third-inning home 
run to Babe Ruth in the process. Hallahan, a native of Binghamton, New 
York, spent most of his career in the employ of the St. Louis Cardinals. 
He signed with their nearby AA farm club, the Syracuse Stars of the International 
League, in 1924. The following season, he made his first NL appearance 
for the Redbirds, appearing in six games. In 1926, Hallahan pitched in 
19 games for the Cardinals during the regular season, and made a first, 
brief World Series appearance that fall against the New York Yankees. But 
Hallahan was not yet ready for an extended Major League career. He spent 
1927 with Syracuse, winning 19 games and leading the International League 
in strikeouts (195) and walks (135). The next season, he won 23 games for 
the Houston Buffaloes and led the Texas League in strikeouts (244). Finally, 
in 1929, he rejoined the Cardinals for good. He became a starting pitcher 
in 1930, winning 15 games for the pennant-winning Cardinals and leading 
the NL in strikeouts (177) and walks (126). In the 1930 World Series against 
the Philadelphia Athletics, Hallahan split two decisions but he shut out 
the powerful A's in Game 3 and allowed only two earned runs in 11 innings, 
for a sparkling ERA of 1.64. Philadelphia won the Series in six games, 
the only World Series Hallahan's Cardinals would ever lose. In 1931, Hallahan 
again led the NL in strikeouts (159) and walks (112) and won 19 games, 
as St. Louis again took the league championship for a rematch against the 
Athletics. This time, Hallahan was even more effective. He shut out the 
A's again in Game 2, pitched a complete game 5–1 victory in Game 5, and 
nailed down the decisive Game 7 in relief by getting the last out in the 
ninth inning. Altogether, he gave up only 12 hits and one run in 18⅓ innings 
— an ERA of 0.36 — as St. Louis triumphed in seven games. Hallahan's dominance 
is even more impressive because the A's featured a predominantly right-handed-hitting 
lineup, including fearsome sluggers Jimmie Foxx and Al Simmons. After two 
more winning campaigns for non-contending Cardinal clubs, Hallahan won 
only eight games, losing 12, for the 1934 edition. But the Gashouse Gang 
won the National League title and gave Hallahan one more chance to experience 
the big stage. In Game 2 of the 1934 World Series, against the Detroit 
Tigers, Hallahan started against Detroit ace Schoolboy Rowe and left with 
one out in the eighth inning of a 2–2 tie. Detroit won the game in the 
ninth, 3–2, but overall the Cardinals again prevailed in seven games. Altogether, 
in seven World Series games and 39⅓ innings, Hallahan won three games, 
lost one with an earned-run average of 1.36—still, in 2014, one of the 
ten lowest (and best) ERAs ever recorded by a pitcher in the postseason 
(which now includes divisional and championship series playoffs).[1] He 
stayed with the Cardinals until May 31, 1936, when he was sold to the Cincinnati 
Reds, then a second-division team. His career statistics suffered with 
the Reds and his final club, the cellar-dwelling Philadelphia Phillies. 
Over his last two seasons, 1937–38, Hallahan won four and lost 17 games. 
He finished with a regular-season record of 102 victories and 94 defeats, 
856 strikeouts and 779 walks, and an ERA of 4.03 in 1,740 innings pitched. 
After retiring from baseball, Hallahan worked as a supervisor for General 
Aniline and Film Co. (now GAF) in Johnson City, New York. He lived on Davis 
Street on the West Side of Binghamton, where he led a very quiet life. 
He was a local legend to the young kids in that neighborhood who frequently 
begged him to show them his World Series watches and rings. He always obliged. 
Wild Bill would attend Little League games at nearby Recreation Park to 
cheer on the neighborhood kids. The field there is dedicated in his honor.
