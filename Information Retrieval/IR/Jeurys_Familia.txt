Jeurys Familia (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈxeuɾis faˈmilja]; born October 
10, 1989) is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher for the New York 
Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB). Familia was signed by the New York 
Mets as a non-drafted free agent in 2007. He made his MLB debut in 2012. 
During the 2015 season, Familia was named the team's closer. He was named 
a MLB All-Star in 2016. Familia's father worked for the Dominican military 
and part-time at a gas station despite being hindered by a leg injury suffered 
in a childhood accident. Familia's mother worked in a small boutique. On 
their combined wages, the parents raised five children.[1][2] Growing up 
in the Boca Chica section of Santo Domingo, Familia's favorite sport to 
play was basketball. He was especially fond of Allen Iverson and was also 
a fan of Kobe Bryant. He did not begin playing baseball until he was older 
and his friends had largely abandoned basketball in its favor. He did not 
have access to baseball equipment for most of his childhood.[1][2] Familia 
is 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and 230 pounds (100 kg); he bats and throws 
right-handed. Familia was signed by the New York Mets as an amateur free 
agent on July 13, 2007 for $100,000. Familia pitched for the Gulf Coast 
Mets in 2008, compiling a 2–2 record with a 2.79 ERA in 51.2 innings pitched. 
In 2009 he pitched for the Single-A Savannah Sand Gnats, going 10–6 with 
a 2.69 ERA in 134 innings pitched. In 2010, Familia was promoted to the 
St. Lucie Mets of the Florida State League. He went 6–9 with a 5.58 ERA 
through 121 innings and struck out 10.2 batters per nine innings in a full 
season with St. Lucie. Also in 2010, Familia was selected to represent 
the Mets at the All-Star Futures Game where he pitched for the World Team.[3] 
Due to his sub-par performance in 2010, Familia began the 2011 season with 
the Single-A St. Lucie Mets. After six starts he went 1–1 with a 1.49 ERA 
in 36.1 innings. Familia was then promoted to the Double-A Binghamton Mets 
of the Eastern League. After his promotion to Binghamton, Familia went 
4–4 with a 3.49 ERA in 87.2 innings. He finished the 2011 season across 
2 minor league levels at 5–5 with a 2.90 ERA. Familia's performance made 
him an EAS Mid-Season All-Star. On November 18, 2011, Familia was added 
to the Mets 40 man roster.[4] After getting back on track in 2011, Familia 
was promoted to the Mets Triple-A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons of the 
International League, in 2012. Prior to starting his minor league season, 
Familia was invited to the Mets Spring Training Camp.[5] Familia was also 
ranked at 84th on MLB.com's best 100 prospects list and 3rd in the Mets 
organization prior to the start of the 2012 campaign.[6] Through 28 starts 
with Buffalo, Familia went 9–9 with a 4.73 ERA. On September 4, Familia 
was called up the New York Mets due to expanded September rosters.[7] On 
September 4, 2012, Familia made his major league debut against the St. 
Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium. He pitched a scoreless eighth inning, 
striking out the first batter he faced, Lance Berkman.[8] Although Familia 
has predominantly started in the minors, he was used out of the bullpen 
as a reliever in his inaugural season. Familia made one start in 2012 on 
October 1 against the Miami Marlins at Marlins Park by pitching four scoreless 
innings, walking six batters, striking out three and giving up just one 
hit. The Mets wound up losing 2–3.[9] Familia finished the season with 
an ERA of 5.84 appearing in 8 games (one start) in 12.1 innings pitched 
with 10 strikeouts and a WHIP of 1.541 while giving up 10 hits, 8 runs 
and 9 walks. Familia made the Mets' roster for Opening Day in 2013.[10] 
He made one appearance before being optioned to Triple-A Las Vegas for 
Aaron Laffey on April 7.[11] After 4 appearances there, he was recalled 
on April 17, replacing Greg Burke.[12] After 7 appearances with the Mets, 
he was placed on the disabled list on May 12 with tendinitis in his right 
elbow.[13] After starting a rehab assignment in St. Lucie, his elbow got 
worse, and he underwent surgery on June 5.[14] Familia was moved to the 
60-day disabled list to make room for David Aardsma on the 40-man roster.[15] 
After making one rehab start in St. Lucie and one in Brooklyn, he was activated 
by the Mets on September 14.[16] He made one appearance before the end 
of the season. In 9 games with New York in 2013, he finished 3 games with 
a 4.22 ERA with 8 strikeouts and a WHIP of 1.969 in 10.2 innings pitched 
while giving up 12 hits, 5 runs, 2 home runs, and 9 walks. He also recorded 
one save. On July 30, 2014, against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citi Field, 
Familia came into the game in the seventh inning and got the final out 
while facing one batter. In the bottom half with runners on first and second, 
two out, Mets leading 8–2 and one a one ball count, Familia lined a hit 
into left field scoring in Chris Young for his first RBI and his second 
hit of his career and of that season. The hit came off of pitcher Justin 
De Fratus. He went 2 for 3 with an average of .667 in 2014. Familia pitched 
the eight inning getting three outs with one strikeout facing three batters.[17] 
Familia finished the season with a 2–5 record, 2.21 ERA in 76 games with 
73 strikeouts, five saves with a WHIP of 1.177 in 77.1 innings pitched. 
He wound up giving up 59 hits, 26 runs (19 of them earned), 3 home runs, 
and 32 walks. Familia became the established eighth inning pitcher, or 
the "set-up man" in front of the closer, Jenrry Mejia, in 2014.[18] When 
Mejia was suspended early in the 2015 season, Familia became the Mets' 
closer.[19][20] Familia made it to the final vote of the 2015 Major League 
Baseball All-Star Game but lost to Carlos Martinez. Familia struggled after 
the All-Star break, blowing three consecutive saves in late July, including 
giving up a game-winning home run to Justin Upton on July 30, 2015, when 
the Mets blew a six-run lead.[21] In the following weeks, however, he dramatically 
turned things around with 16 consecutive scoreless innings, zero earned 
runs, and eight converted saves in eight opportunities.[22] On October 
4, Familia recorded his forty-third save in a 1–0 win against the Washington 
Nationals at Citi Field. He gave up a double to Bryce Harper with two outs 
and got Jayson Werth to fly out to center fielder Juan Lagares to end the 
game. The game was the final game of the 2015 regular season and snapped 
the Mets' five game losing streak. The save tied the club record set by 
Armando Benítez in 2001.[23][24] He finished the season with a 2–2 record, 
1.85 ERA in 76 games with a career high 43 saves, 86 strikeouts in 78 innings 
pitched with a WHIP of 1.000 while giving up 59 hits, 16 runs, 6 home runs, 
and 19 walks. Familia recorded two saves in the 2015 National League Division 
Series against the Dodgers, retiring all 16 batters he faced.[25] In the 
2015 National League Championship Series against the Cubs, Familia recorded 
three saves over 4 1⁄3 innings pitched, giving up 2 hits and 2 walks and 
no runs.[26] Familia struck out Dexter Fowler to send the Mets to the World 
Series. In game 1 of the 2015 World Series against the Kansas City Royals, 
he gave up a game-tying home run to Alex Gordon in the ninth inning; the 
Mets would eventually lose, 5–4, in 14 innings.[27] He gave up the home 
run to Gordon on a quick pitch, which Familia used to throw off hitters' 
timing throughout the 2015 season.[28] Familia blew saves in games 4 and 
5 as well, both of which the Mets lost, the latter of which ended the series. 
Familia's three blown saves in the series established a new World Series 
record.[29] He tied Robb Nen for most save opportunities in one postseason, 
with eight. On May 25, Familia set a franchise record by converting 32 
consecutive save opportunities, breaking a tie with Billy Wagner.[30] On 
June 24, Familia broke another franchise record previously held by Armando 
Benítez by converting 25 consecutive save opportunities to open the season.[31] 
On July 5, Familia was named to the National League roster for the 2016 
Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Petco Park, joining teammate Yoenis 
Céspedes, fellow first time All-Star Noah Syndergaard and Mets manager 
Terry Collins.[32] On July 27, Familia blew his first save opportunity 
of his last 53 after allowing two runs on two hits and two walks to the 
St. Louis Cardinals, ending the third longest consecutive save streak in 
MLB history.[33] On August 31, Familia recorded his 44th save of the season, 
breaking the Mets club record previously held by Armando Benítez and tied 
by Familia in 2015.[34] Familia finished the season with 51 saves, the 
most in Major League Baseball.[35] He became the only Mets pitcher other 
than John Franco to lead the National League in saves.[36] Despite his 
brilliant save record for the year, Familia gave up the winning three-run 
home run to Conor Gillaspie in the top of the ninth in the 2016 National 
League Wild Card Game against the San Francisco Giants as the Mets lost 
3–0. Familia's son, Jeurys Jr., was born to his fiancée, Bianca Rivas, 
on June 12, 2015, while the elder Familia saved a win against the Atlanta 
Braves.[37] In the summer of 2015, Familia also completed construction 
on a new house for his parents back in the Dominican Republic. Construction 
on the house had begun in 2014 but was delayed when Familia decided to 
pay for surgery to repair a leg injury that had plagued his father since 
childhood.[2] On October 31, 2016, Familia was arrested on a domestic violence
