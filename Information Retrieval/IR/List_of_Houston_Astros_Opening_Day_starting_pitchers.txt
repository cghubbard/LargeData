The Houston Astros are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in 
Houston, Texas. They currently play in the American League West division. 
The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening 
Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often 
given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season,[1] 
though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might 
not start on Opening Day.[2] The Houston Astros have used 21 different 
Opening Day starting pitchers in their 49 seasons. The 20 starters have 
a combined Opening Day record of 20 wins, 21 losses and 9 no decisions.[3][4] 
No decisions are only awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won 
or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game.[5] The Astros began 
to play in 1962 as the Houston Colt .45s (their name was changed to the 
Astros in 1965 when the Houston Astrodome opened as their home ball park).[6] 
Bobby Shantz started their first Opening Day game on April 10, 1962 against 
the Chicago Cubs at Houston's Colt Stadium and was credited with the win.[3] 
In their first eight seasons, the Colt .45s / Astros used eight different 
Opening Day starters. In 1970, that streak ended when Larry Dierker made 
his second Opening Day start.[3] Roy Oswalt has made the most Opening Day 
starts for the Astros, with eight such starts from 2003 through 2010.[3][4][7] 
Three different pitchers have each made five Opening Day starts for the 
Astros: J. R. Richard (1976–1980), Mike Scott (1987–1991) and Shane Reynolds 
(1996–2000). Dierker made four Opening Day starts for the Astros, and Joe 
Niekro and Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan made three apiece.[3] Dierker has the 
best record in Opening Day starts with four wins and no losses. Niekro 
and Don Wilson share the worst record in Opening Day starts with no wins 
and two losses each. Niekro also had one no decision.[3] The Astros have 
played in three home ball parks. Their first home ball park was Colt Stadium. 
Their starting pitchers had one win and one loss in their two Opening Day 
games at Colt Stadium. They played 25 Opening Day games in the Astrodome 
after moving there in 1965, and their starting pitchers had a record of 
12 wins, 8 losses and 5 no decisions in those games. In 2000, they moved 
to Enron Field (subsequently renamed Astros Field and Minute Maid Park) 
in Downtown Houston. Through 2010, they have played nine Opening Day games 
there, and their starting pitchers have a record of three wins, four losses 
and two no decisions in those games. This makes the record of the Astros' 
Opening Day starting pitchers in home games 16 wins, 13 losses and 7 no decisions. 
Their record in Opening Day away games is four wins, eight losses and two no decisions.[3] 
The Astros have advanced to the World Series once, in 2005.[8] Oswalt lost
