As Player As Manager Charles Hazen "Charlie" Morton (October 12, 1854 – 
December 9, 1921) was an American Major League Baseball outfielder, manager, 
and League executive. As a manager, he led a team whose members included 
the first African-American players in Major League history.[1] After retiring 
from the major leagues, Morton served intermittently as an official and 
went on to become an influential minor league baseball executive. Morton 
played for, and managed in, the American Association, with the Toledo Blue 
Stockings in 1884 and the Detroit Wolverines in 1885. He played one season 
prior to managing, 1882, and managed the 1890 Toledo Maumees after his 
playing career was over.[2] He compiled a career managerial record of 121 
wins and 153 losses.[3] He was the manager for the 1884 Toledo Blue Stockings, 
who had transferred into the American Association from the Northwestern 
League after the 1883 season.[4] It was this team that included Moses Fleetwood 
Walker and his brother Welday Walker, who are now considered the first 
African-American players to play in Major League Baseball.[1] On August 
10, 1883 before a scheduled exhibition game, Cap Anson and his Chicago 
White Stockings had told Morton that his team would not play on the same 
field as the Walker brothers. Even though he had initially given Walker 
the day off due to injuries, Morton then re-inserted Moses in the game. 
He did this to force Anson to either play or lose his portion of the gate 
receipts.[1] Anson decided to play that day, but when Chicago came to town 
the following year, they had already signed an agreement that the Walker 
brothers would not play.[1] After his playing career, Morton spent much 
of his time as an executive, most notably as the founder and president 
of the Ohio–Pennsylvania League during its existence from 1905 through 
1912.[5] By the end of its seven-year lifespan, the league had enlisted 
the membership of no less than 40 ball clubs based in over 20 cities.[5] 
Morton also served as an official, umpiring a number of games during the 
1886 season.[citation needed] He died in Massillon, Ohio at the age of
