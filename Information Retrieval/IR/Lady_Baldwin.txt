Charles B. "Lady" Baldwin (April 8, 1859 – March 7, 1937) was an American 
left-handed pitcher. He played six seasons in Major League Baseball with 
the Milwaukee Brewers (1884), Detroit Wolverines (1885–1888), Brooklyn 
Bridegrooms (1890), and Buffalo Bisons (1890). Baldwin had his best season 
in 1886 when he compiled a 42–13 record and a 2.24 earned run average (ERA), 
threw 55 complete games, and led the National League with 323 strikeouts. 
Baldwin's 42 wins in 1886 set the major league record for a left-handed 
pitcher and remains the second highest single season total by a southpaw. 
Baldwin also pitched five complete games for a 4–1 record and a 1.50 ERA 
in the 1887 World Series. Arm troubles cut short Baldwin's major league 
career at age 31. Baldwin was born in 1859 in Oramel, Allegany County, 
New York, approximately 60 miles southeast of Buffalo.[1] His father, Samuel 
Baldwin, was a farmer.[2][3] As a boy, he moved with his family to Barry 
County in western Michigan, first to Johnstown Township and then to Hastings.[2][3][4] 
Baldwin was introduced to baseball in Hastings and began his pitching career 
for the Hastings team.[4] His battery-mate on the Hastings team was Deacon 
McGuire, with whom he would later play as a member of the Detroit Wolverines.[5] 
Baldwin began his professional baseball career in 1883 playing for the 
Grand Rapids, Michigan, team in the Northwestern League.[6] In 1884, at 
age 25, Baldwin played for the Milwaukee Brewers of the Northwestern League. 
He compiled a 9-10 record in 22 games in the Northwestern League despite 
having an impressive 1.17 earned run average (ERA). The Northwestern Association 
disbanded during the 1884 season, and the Brewers became part of the Union 
Association, considered a major league, toward the end of the season. Baldwin 
made his major league debut with the Brewers on September 30, 1884. He 
compiled a 1-1 record and 2.65 ERA in two games in the Union Association.[1][4] 
In 1885, the Brewers became members of the Western Association. Baldwin 
pitched impressively for the Brewers in 1885, compiling an 11-4 record 
and a 0.68 ERA in 16 games.[7] Baldwin was given the nickname "Lady" because 
of his "quiet ways" and his refusal to swear or to come into contact with 
either tobacco or liquor.[6][8][9] During the 1885 season, Baldwin was 
acquired by the Detroit Wolverines of the National League. He appeared 
in 21 games for Detroit in 1885 and, despite an impressive 1.86 ERA, managed 
only an 11-9 record for a team that finished in sixth place with a 41-67 
record.[1] Baldwin led the National League in walks plus hits per inning 
pitched (0.92) and in strikeouts per nine innings pitched (6.775),[1] and 
he was the only pitcher on the 1885 Detroit team to compile a winning record.[10] 
In 1886, the Wolverines acquired "The Big Four" (Dan Brouthers, Deacon 
White, Hardy Richardson, and Jack Rowe) from Buffalo and improved to second 
place and an 87-36 record. Baldwin accounted for nearly half of Detroit's 
victories in 1886. He compiled a record of 42–13 with a 2.24 ERA in 487 
innings pitched, striking out 323 of 1,936 batters faced. Baldwin also 
completed 55 of 56 games, seven of which were via shutout.[1] One of Baldwin's 
complete games in 1886 was a 3-0, 14-inning victory over the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[8] Another was a one-hitter against Washington in June 1886 in 
which he struck out 13 batters.[11] Baldwin's 42 wins in 1886 set a major 
league record for a left-handed pitcher and remains the second highest 
single season total by a southpaw.[12] Baldwin was also "reputed to be 
the first southpaw hurler to master the curve."[13] In 1887, the Wolverines 
won the National League pennant and the 1887 World Series.[14] However, 
a shoulder injury sidelined Baldwin during the season, and he was "sent 
home without pay" in late July.[6] Baldwin rejoined the Wolverines in August, 
and after resting his arm, won seven of his last eight games.[6] Baldwin 
appeared in only 24 games in 1887 (down from 56 in 1886) and compiled a 
13-10 record and a 3.84 ERA.[1] The heaviest load for the 1887 team was 
handled by Charlie Getzein who compiled a 29-13 record.[14] However, in 
the World Series, Baldwin pitched five complete games for a 4–1 record 
and a 1.50 ERA.[15] Baldwin was also a strong hitting pitcher. During Detroit's 
1887 championship year, Baldwin compiled a respectable .271 batting average 
and a .354 on-base percentage.[1] In 1888, Baldwin was able to play in 
only six games. According to some sources, his pitching arm was "dead" 
from overwork in the three prior seasons.[6] He compiled a 3-3 record in 
1888, but saw his ERA balloon to 5.43—nearly 300% higher than his ERA of 
1.86 just three years earlier.[1] Ned Hanlon, who played with Baldwin in 
Detroit, later said of Baldwin: "I will not hesitate in saying that 'Lady' 
Baldwin was the best left-handed pitcher of his day and one of the best 
that ever stood in the box. He had wonderful command, speed and curves, 
and knew how to work the batters."[16] Baldwin attempted a comeback in 
1890. He split the 1890 season between the Brooklyn Bridegrooms of the 
National League and the Buffalo Bisons of the Players' League. He compiled 
a 3-5 record and 4.78 ERA in nine games for the two teams.[1] He appeared 
in his final major league game on June 26, 1890,[1] and was released by 
Buffalo in early July 1890.[17] By 1890, Baldwin had returned to his hometown 
of Hastings, Michigan, and taken up farming.[18] At the time of the 1900 
Census, Baldwin was living in Hastings with his wife Dora E. Baldwin.[19] 
He remained in Hastings for the remainder of his life and became a successful 
orchard owner and farmer. In 1910, he was seriously injured when he fell 
from a hay mow, breaking his collarbone. The injury deprived Baldwin of 
the full use of his right arm, and he underwent surgery at the University 
of Michigan Hospital to correct the problem.[20] In 1914, he was again 
seriously injured after falling from a ladder and was unable to walk for 
months.[21] He later went into the real estate business in Hastings.[6] 
Baldwin died in 1937 after an illness of six months at age 77.[22] He was
