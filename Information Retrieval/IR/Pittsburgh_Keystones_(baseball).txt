The Pittsburgh Keystones was the name of two historic professional Negro 
league baseball teams that operated in 1887 and again in 1921 and 1922. 
The first team was a member of the first black baseball league in 1887, 
the League of Colored Baseball Clubs. The league only lasted a week, which 
resulted in a 3-4 record for the Keystones, an included Weldy Walker, the 
second African-American to play in the major leagues and future hall of 
famer, Sol White.[1] The second club was founded by Alexander McDonald 
Williams, a Barbadian immigrant and pool hall operator.[2] The Keystones' 
home field was Central Park, located in the Hill District at the corner 
of Chauncey Street and Humber Way.[3] The park was built by the prominent 
African American architect Louis A. S. Bellinger, who would later design 
Greenlee Field for the Pittsburgh Crawfords.[4][5] In their first season 
the Pittsburgh Keystones played as associate members of the Negro National 
League. Managed by Fred Downer, they compiled a 7-14-1 record against league 
and other associate clubs.[6] The Keystones joined the league as full members 
in 1922, finishing sixth with a 14-23-2 record in league play under managers 
Dizzy Dismukes and Dicta Johnson.[7] The team disbanded after the season.
