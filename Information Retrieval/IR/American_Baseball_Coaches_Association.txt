The American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) is the world's largest 
amateur baseball coaching organization. It was originally founded in 1945 
as the American Association of College Baseball Coaches.[1][2][3][4] Now, 
the ABCA comprises over 8,300 baseball coaches from all levels of amateur 
baseball, including youth, high school, travel ball, NAIA, JUCO and NCAA 
Divisions I, II and III, among others.[5] The organization was originally 
named the American Association of College Baseball Coaches.[1] Presidents 
have come from NCAA Divisions I, II & III, NAIA, junior college, and high 
school.[1][2][3] The Association was behind the start of the creation of 
the College World Series, which now is conducted by the NCAA.[1] As of 
2016, the Association has over 8,300 members with members hailing from 
nearly 25 different countries, and includes coaches from all ranks of amateur 
baseball. The membership year for the ABCA runs from September 1 through 
August 31.[5] The ABCA hosts the world's largest baseball convention every 
January.[5] The convention features coaching clinics, trade show and meetings 
as well as several awards presentations and honors.[6] Over 5,600 coaches 
attend the convention, which lasts for four days.[7] The convention is 
on a rotating schedule with the 2017 convention scheduled for Anaheim, 
California, 2018 in Indianapolis, Indiana and the 2019 convention in Dallas, 
Texas. A major draw are the nearly 30 clinic speakers each year. These 
include some of the most knowledgeable baseball coaches and minds in the 
world and are on-hand to share their experiences and expertise with fellow 
coaches. Attendees receive each clinic video for free at the end of the 
convention on ABCAvideos.org. At the ABCA Trade Show, over 330 companies 
fill up over 130,000 square feet of exhibit space and are on hand to display 
state-of-the-art equipment and products, including coaching aids, apparel, 
field equipment, pitching machines and software. Many products are displayed 
for the first time and some items are even raffled off as prizes. Induction 
to the ABCA Hall of Fame is the highest honor bestowed by the ABCA organization. 
The ABCA Hall of Fame was established in 1966 with the inaugural 18 member 
class. Each year's Hall of Fame class is inducted during the Hall of Fame/Coach 
of the Year Banquet at the annual ABCA Convention in January. The entire 
American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame is honored at www.ABCAHallOfFame.org. 
The ABCA has selected All-American Teams in each division of the ABCA, 
as well as an All-American/Coach of the Year Committee, as well as All-Region 
Teams.[1] Each division also selects a National Player of the Year, as 
well as All-Region Coaches of the Year and National Coaches of the Year.[1] 
Each year, over 1,700 All-Region Players and 336 All-American Players are 
selected.[1] The ABCA launched the revamped ABCAvideos.org in 2016, which 
sells both Videos On Demand (VOD) of detailed training and instruction 
from past clinic speakers. The ABCAvideos.org library features over 200 
videos that range from 45 minutes to 1 hour in length dating back to the 
2008 ABCA Convention. Topics of discussion include player development and 
positional play as well as coaching development. All coaches that attend 
the annual ABCA Convention receive that year's set of clinic videos free 
of charge and current ABCA members also receive 30% off all ABCAvideos.org
