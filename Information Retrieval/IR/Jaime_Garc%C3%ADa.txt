Jaime Omar García (born July 8, 1986) is a Mexican professional baseball 
pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). The 
Cardinals drafted him in the 22nd round of the 2005 MLB Draft from Sharyland 
High School in Mission, Texas, and he made his MLB debut with the Cardinals 
in 2008. A member of the 2011 World Series championship Cardinals, García 
has struggled with injury throughout his career, reaching 100 innings pitched 
in just three of five seasons since 2010. In 2010, he was third in the 
National League Rookie of the Year balloting while posting the fourth-best 
earned run average in the league. The next season, he was ninth in winning 
percentage. García's was signed by the St.Louis Cardinals through 2017. 
Jaime García was born on July 8, 1986 in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico, as 
the second of three children to civil engineer Jaime García, Sr., and Gloria 
Rodríguez Flores. He was raised between the border of Reynosa, and McAllen, 
Texas. He attended Sharyland High School in Mission, Texas. The Baltimore 
Orioles originally drafted García in the 30th round of the 2004 MLB Draft. 
Due to a poorly translated test, the Orioles chose not to sign García. 
By the time a new scouting director changed the team's position, García 
opted to re-enter the draft.[1] Afterward, the St. Louis Cardinals drafted 
García in the 22nd round of the 2005 MLB Draft. Joe Almaraz, the Orioles 
scout who wanted to sign García the year before, had moved on to the Cardinals 
organization, and was influential in the Cardinals selection of García.[1] 
García made his major league debut in relief on July 11, 2008, against 
the Pittsburgh Pirates. He pitched two innings, giving up one hit, walking 
one, and striking out two. García underwent Tommy John surgery after the 
2008 season and began the 2009 season on the 60-day disabled list. Later 
in the 2009 season, García returned to the Cardinals organization and was 
optioned to the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds. On September 9, 2009, García 
retired the first 13 batters he faced in the Redbirds' first playoff game 
against the Albuquerque Isotopes. The 2010 MLB season was García's first 
full season in the majors. He was chosen as the number five starter over 
fellow lefty Rich Hill, who started the season with the Memphis Redbirds 
in AAA, and Kyle McClellan, who returned to the bullpen for the Cardinals. 
He finished the season in third place in the voting for NL Rookie of the 
Year with a record of 13–8, and an ERA of 2.70 (4th in the NL).[2] García 
was named a starting pitcher on Baseball America's 2010 All-Rookie Team 
and a pitcher on the 2010 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team.[3] García 
began the 2011 season as the number-three starter. In his first start of 
the season, April 3 against the San Diego Padres, he threw his first MLB 
complete game shutout while striking out nine and giving up four hits in 
102 pitches. For this performance, he was named a co-winner of the National 
League Player of the Week Award.[4] On May 6, he took a perfect game into 
the eighth inning against the Milwaukee Brewers, before issuing a one-out 
walk to Casey McGehee, followed by a hit to Yuniesky Betancourt. The near-perfect 
game ended as a two hit complete-game shutout.[5] On July 13, the Cardinals 
announced they had signed García to a four-year contract extension that 
guaranteed him $27.5 million. The contract included club options for the 
following two seasons. With the club option, García had the opportunity 
to earn $50 million, which could keep him with the team for six years until 
2017. To that point in the season, he was 9–3 with a 3.23 ERA.[6] On August 
2, García hit his first career home run, a three-run homer off Brewers' 
starter Shaun Marcum. For the 2011 season, García went 13–7, was second 
in the NL in complete games (two), shutouts (two), and wild pitches (12), 
and his .650 win-loss percentage was ninth best in the National League.[2] 
The St. Louis Cardinals advanced to play the Texas Rangers in the World 
Series after defeating the Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee Brewers 
in the playoffs. When García started Game 2, he became the second Mexican-born 
pitcher since Fernando Valenzuela in 1981 to ever start a World Series 
game. García pitched 10 innings, including seven scoreless innings, and 
posted a 1.80 ERA with 10 strikeouts in the series. On October 28, the 
Cardinals defeated the Rangers 4–3 in the best-of-seven series after being 
down 3–2 to claim the franchise's 11th World Series title. García went 
7–7 with a 3.92 ERA in 20 starts in the 2012 season before being shutdown 
for the year due to shoulder discomfort. The Cardinals would go on to be 
one win away from going to the 2012 World Series before losing to the San 
Francisco Giants in the NLCS.[7] In 2013, García went 5–2 with a 3.58 ERA 
before being injured and ultimately undergoing season-ending shoulder surgery, 
with his last start on May 17.[8] García was initially thought to be able 
to play at the start of the 2014 season,[9] but developed shoulder bursitis 
and was unable to pitch in the major leagues for 366 days until activated, 
with his first start on May 18, 2014.[10] In his fifth start of the season 
on June 8, García held the Toronto Blue Jays to seven scoreless innings 
to earn the win in a 5–0 victory.[11] In the first inning of the game, 
he issued his first walks of the season, which he had avoided in his first 
24 2⁄3 IP.[12][13] However, he informed the Cardinals on July 5 that he 
would have surgery on his left shoulder to correct thoracic outlet syndrome, 
ending his second consecutive season with fewer than ten starts.[14] In 
May 2015, García returned to pitch for the Cardinals. He lost his first 
start to the New York Mets, 5–0, despite allowing just two runs in seven 
innings. He gained his first win in nearly a year on May 26 against the 
Arizona Diamondbacks, in which he completed six innings in a 6–4 victory.[15] 
His next start, on June 1, was against the Brewers. In seven innings, he 
allowed one run and struck out four, with less than 90 pitches, but ended 
up with a 1–0 loss, bringing his record to 1–2 with a 2.70 ERA in his first 
three games.[16] In a June 12 start against the Kansas City Royals, Jaime 
García netted his 500th career strikeout by getting Omar Infante as the 
Cardinals won 4–0. It was García's 102nd career start; he had also not 
issued a walk in his first 30 IP of the season.[17] The Cardinals placed 
García with a right groin strain on July 5. He had sustained the injury 
on June 24 while running the bases against the Miami Marlins.[18] While 
carrying out his minor league rehabilitation assignment with the Peoria 
Chiefs on July 23, he pitched in a combined no-hitter and 2–0 win against 
the Clinton LumberKings, a Seattle Mariners affiliate. The starter for 
the game, García pitched the first five innings and struck out six.[19][20] 
While completing 8 1⁄3 innings against the Miami Marlins on August 14 in 
a 3–1 win, one of the hits García allowed was to Ichiro Suzuki, for his 
4,191st hit in professional baseball, matching Ty Cobb.[a][21] Garcia achieved 
his 50th career win in a 4–1 decision over the Pirates on September 5, 
also reaching 100 IP in a season for the first time since 2012.[22] Totaling 
20 regular season starts,[23] he finished the season with 10–6 won–loss 
record, 2.43 ERA, and 1.046 walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP). 
The Cardinals won 10 of his 11 starts in August and September; and, at 
Busch Stadium, he turned in nine quality starts in 10 attempts, allowing 
a 1.70 ERA and 0.888 WHIP. The Cardinals won 100 games and the National 
League Central division title. He started Game 2 of the NLDS against the 
Cubs, but lasted just two innings as the Cardinals lost this game 6–3 before 
the Cubs eliminated the Cardinals. On October 31, 2015, the Cardinals announced 
they exercised García's team option for 2016 worth $11.5 million.[24] In 
his second appearance of 2016, García turned in a career start against 
Milwaukee at Busch Stadium on April 14. He pitched a complete game one-hit 
shutout while striking out a career-high 13 batters and inducing 13 ground 
outs as St. Louis won, 7–0. He became the first left-handed pitcher in 
franchise history to achieve a one-hit shutout while striking out at least 
13. He also collected two hits while batting.[25] The 13 strikeouts were 
the most by a Cardinal lefty since Steve Carlton struck out 16 in 1970, 
with García posting a game score of 97, a season-high for MLB through that 
date.[26] He struck out 11 in eight innings on August 5, defeating the 
Atlanta Braves 1−0, and driving in the only run of the game.[27] Four pitches 
comprise García's arsenal: fastball that reaches approximately 90 miles 
per hour (140 km/h), curveball, slider and changeup. Mananger Mike Matheny 
has called the movement on his pitches "baffling" and "wipeout."[28] García 
has two sisters; Karina and Ahimee García.[29] a Ichiro Suzuki achieved 
his hit total both in Major League Baseball and the Nippon Professional
