Lyle Stefan Overbay (born January 28, 1977) is an American former professional 
baseball first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the 
Arizona Diamondbacks, Toronto Blue Jays, Pittsburgh Pirates, Atlanta Braves, 
New York Yankees and Milwaukee Brewers. Overbay attended the University 
of Nevada, Reno, where he played college baseball for the Nevada Wolf Pack 
baseball team. Overbay was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 
18th round of the 1999 MLB draft. While playing in the farm system, he 
was named Diamondbacks minor league player of the year.[when?][1] Overbay 
made his Major League debut on September 19, 2001. Overbay appeared in 
2 games getting one hit out of 2 plate appearances during his brief stint 
in the majors in 2001. He was also part of the Diamondbacks' postseason 
roster to serve as a backup first baseman and eventually won the World 
Series over the Yankees. During the 2002 season, Overbay played mostly 
in the minors and only played in 10 games in the majors. Overbay first 
played with the Diamondbacks as the full-time first baseman in 2003. He 
played in 86 games, batting .276 with 28 RBI and 4 home runs. He was sent 
down to Triple-A Tucson in June, but was called up in September to be part 
of the 40-man roster expansion. He was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers 
during the off-season.[1] Overbay was acquired by the Milwaukee Brewers 
on December 1, 2003, in a trade that sent Richie Sexson and Shane Nance 
to Arizona for Overbay, Craig Counsell, Junior Spivey, Chris Capuano, Chad 
Moeller, and Jorge de la Rosa. During the 2004 season, Overbay batted .301 
with 16 home runs, 87 RBI, and a major league-leading 53 doubles. In 2005, 
Overbay hit 19 home runs, surpassing his 2004 total of 16. On July 23, 
he had a career high 6 RBI against the Cincinnati Reds, hitting two home 
runs, including a grand slam. This feat was also the most in a season by 
a Brewer. He played very well against the Reds, batting .431 with 6 home 
runs and 18 RBI. He was traded to the Blue Jays in the off-season.[1] He 
was a fan favorite in Milwaukee. When Overbay stepped up to plate, fans 
would do the "O chant." Fans would raise their hands over their heads in 
an "O" symbol – some brought cardboard cut outs of the letter "O" – and 
would chant a prolonged "O" sound to honor Overbay. Overbay said of the 
chant, "The "O" chant doesn't break my concentration. Sometimes it gets 
me too pumped up because I want to come through and give the fans something 
to cheer about, instead of just chanting. But overall, I think it's cool 
that I get that treatment from Brewers fans." [2] On December 7, 2005, 
Overbay was traded from the Brewers along with pitching prospect Ty Taubenheim 
to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for outfielder Gabe Gross and pitchers 
Dave Bush and Zach Jackson.[3] Although the trade was acknowledged as a 
needed acquisition for the Blue Jays,[4] Overbay did not have the statistical 
impact hoped for, at least beyond 2006. From 2007 to 2008, Overbay statistically 
trailed Bush in the sabermetric categories wins above replacement player 
and value over replacement player.[5][6] On July 5, 2006, Overbay was named 
American League Player of the Week[7] after hitting .423 and hitting four 
home runs during the week of June 26 to July 2, 2006. In 2006, he had a 
career season, batting .312 with 22 home runs, 92 RBI and 181 hits, which 
were all career-highs. He also had 46 doubles, which was tenth among the 
major leagues.[1] On January 15, 2007, the Toronto Blue Jays signed Overbay 
to a four-year contract, buying out his final two arbitration-eligible 
years, and his first two years of free agency, with a $24 million contract.[8] 
On June 4, 2007, Overbay was hit by a pitch in the sixth inning of a game 
against the Chicago White Sox. The pitch was a high and inside fastball 
that ran in and hit Lyle in the hand, breaking three bones in his hand. 
He was on the disabled list until July 13, 2007, rejoining the Blue Jays 
after the All-Star break. After his return, he struggled at the plate, 
especially with hitting for power. Overbay set a new team record on May 
25, 2008 by reaching base in his 12th consecutive plate appearance after 
walking on a full count in the second inning. The previous record holder 
was Tony Fernández who reached base 11 straight times. That season, he 
was criticized by fans for his penchant to ground into double plays. He 
finished 2008 tied for seventh overall in this category, with 24.[9] Overbay 
is also one of only 15 players to hit into an unassisted triple play, serving 
up Asdrúbal Cabrera of the Cleveland Indians on May 12, 2008. On June 8, 
2009, Overbay was again named American League Player of the Week[10] after 
leading the Major League in both batting average and slugging. He was also 
named the 2009 American Legion Graduate of the Year. On December 14, 2010, 
Overbay signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates. After batting .227 with eight 
home runs and 37 RBIs in 103 games, he was designated for assignment on 
August 1, 2011,[11] and released on August 5.[12] On August 13, he re-signed 
with the Arizona Diamondbacks, replacing the injured Xavier Nady.[13] On 
December 8, 2011, Overbay signed a one-year deal with the Diamondbacks. 
On July 30, Arizona designated Overbay for assignment, and then released 
him on August 3. On August 20, 2012, the Atlanta Braves signed Overbay 
to a minor league contract. He was called up when the rosters expanded 
on September 1, 2012.[14] On January 13, 2013, the Boston Red Sox announced 
that Overbay had been signed to a minor league contract with an invitation 
to major league spring training.[15] He was released by the Red Sox on 
March 26, 2013, and signed by the New York Yankees to a 3-day minor league 
deal later that day.[16][17] On March 31, the Yankees added Overbay to 
their 25-man active roster.[18] On May 10, 2013, Overbay went 4-for-5 with 
2 doubles, a 2-run home run, 5 runs batted in, and 2 runs scored in an 
11–6 win over the Kansas City Royals at Kauffman Stadium. On June 3, he 
made his first career start in right field. On June 26, the Yankees announced 
that Mark Teixeira was going to undergo season-ending wrist surgery, allowing 
Overbay to be the everyday first baseman for the remainder of the season. 
After the team signed Mark Reynolds on August 15, who had been released 
by the Cleveland Indians several days prior, Overbay and Reynolds platooned 
at first base for the remainder of the season, with the left-handed hitting 
Overbay usually starting against right-handed pitchers. On January 20, 
2014, Overbay agreed to a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers 
that contained an invite to spring training.[19] Overbay made the Brewers 
regular season roster, announced March 23, and will play first base for 
the Brewers alongside Mark Reynolds, the team's other first baseman. Coincidentally, 
these same two players played for the Yankees at the same time in the previous 
season. Manager Ron Roenicke cited Overbay's good defense skills at first 
base and his veteran status in making his decision.[20] On May 19, 2014, 
Overbay made his first career pitching appearance against his old team, 
the Atlanta Braves. With two outs in the bottom of the 8th inning of a 
9-3 game, he was called upon to get the final out. He faced only one batter 
(Ryan Doumit), getting the needed out on a popup to the shortstop Jean 
Segura. Overbay finished the 2014 season batting .233 in 121 games, with 
4 home runs and 35 RBI. On October 1, he told MLB Radio Network that he 
was "99.9 percent sure" he would retire.[21] Overbay is married to Sarah
