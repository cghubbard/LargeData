James Joseph "Jimmy" Ring (February 15, 1895, Brooklyn, New York – July 
6, 1965, Queens, New York) was a starting pitcher in Major League Baseball 
who played for the Cincinnati Reds (1917–1920), Philadelphia Phillies (1921–1925, 
1928), New York Giants (1926) and St. Louis Cardinals (1927). Ring batted 
and threw right-handed. Ring was used sparingly by the Cincinnati Reds 
from 1917 to 1918. He won 10 games in 1919, and beat Ed Cicotte and the 
Chicago White Sox in Game Four of the World Series on a five-hit, 2–0 shutout. 
He pitched again in Game Six, losing after allowing one run in five innings 
of relief. The next year he won 17 games, and was sent to the Philadelphia 
Phillies at the end of the season along with Greasy Neale in the same trade 
that brought Eppa Rixey to Cincinnati. From 1921 to 1925 Ring averaged 
12.8 wins per season, with a career-high 18 wins in 1923. Then, he was 
traded by the Phillies to the New York Giants before the 1927 season. After 
an 11–10 mark with the Giants, he was sent to the St. Louis Cardinals along 
with Frankie Frisch in exchange for Rogers Hornsby. Ring failed to win 
a game for St. Louis in 1927. He appeared in 13 games and had a 0–4 record. 
In 1928, his last major league season, he returned to the Phillies and 
had a 4–17 mark in 35 appearances. In a 12-season career, Ring posted a 
118–149 record with 835 strikeouts and a 4.12 ERA in 2354-1/3 innings pitched.
