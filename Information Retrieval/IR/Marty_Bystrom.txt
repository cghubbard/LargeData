Martin Eugene Bystrom (born July 26, 1958, in Coral Gables, Florida), is

for the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Yankees from 1980â€“1985. Bystrom 
was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies as an amateur free agent in December

the Philadelphia Phillies along with Keith Hughes to the New York Yankees 
for pitcher Shane Rawley.[1] Following the 1985 season, Bystrom was granted
