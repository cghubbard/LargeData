The Los Angeles Dodgers are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in Los Angeles, California. They play in the National League West division. 
Since the institution of MLB's Rule 4 Draft, the Dodgers have selected 
59 players in the first round. Officially known as the "First-Year Player 
Draft",[1] the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary mechanism for assigning players 
from high schools, colleges, and other amateur clubs to its franchises. 
The draft order is determined based on the previous season's standings, 
with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first pick.[1] 
In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous off-season may 
be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.[2] Of the 60 players picked 
in the first round by Los Angeles, 34 have been pitchers, the most of any 
position; 22 of these were right-handed, while 11 were left-handed. Nine 
players each at shortstop and seven in the outfield were selected, while 
five catchers, three first basemen, and two third basemen were taken as 
well. The team also selected one player at second base.[3] Seven of the 
players came from high schools or universities in the state of Texas, while 
California follows with six players. Five Dodgers first-round picks have 
won a World Series championships with the team. Pitchers Bob Welch (1977) 
and Steve Howe (1979) played with the 1981 championship team.[4][5] Shortstop 
Dave Anderson (1981) and first baseman Franklin Stubbs (1982) were a part 
of the 1988 championship team.[6][7] Catcher Mike Scioscia (1976) won championships 
with both teams.[8] Welch was also on the Oakland Athletics' 1988 team 
which lost to the Dodgers in the 1988 Series.[4] Howe and Rick Sutcliffe 
(1974) each won the MLB Rookie of the Year award.[5][9] The Dodgers have 
made 11 selections in the supplemental round of the draft and have never 
made the first overall selection.[3][10] They have also had 16 compensatory 
picks since the institution of the First-Year Player Draft in 1965.[3] 
These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable 
free agent in the prior off-season,[2][11][V] or, more recently, if a team 
fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year.[12] The Dodgers have 
failed to sign one of their first-round picks, Luke Hochevar (2005), but
