As player As manager Jeffrey Allen Torborg (born November 26, 1941) is 
a former catcher and manager in Major League Baseball. Torborg was signed 
by Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent in 1963. On September 9, 
1965, Torborg caught Sandy Koufax's perfect game. On July 20, 1970, he 
was the catcher receiving Bill Singer's no-hitter[1][2] and on May 15, 
1973, Torborg also caught the first of Nolan Ryan's 7 no-hitters. Torborg 
grew up in Westfield, New Jersey, where he was the catcher on the Westfield 
High School baseball team.[3] He caught at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, 
New Jersey. He was a 1963 All-American, setting the school record for season 
batting average; his .537 batting average was the highest for 100 at-bats 
and under. His .537 average was the highest ever recorded up to that time 
and since then, only two college players have hit for a better average. 
His slugging percentage that year (1.032) is also a single-season standard. 
He led the team with 21 RBI and six home runs.In his three-year career 
from 1961–63, the Torborg batted .390. His number (#10) was retired in 
1992. He still holds the career slugging percentage mark of .684. During 
his career, the Knights were 15–4–1, 14–4 and 11–5 for a three-year mark 
of 40–13–1 (.741 winning percentage). After a successful ten-year career 
as a catcher with the Dodgers and Angels, Torborg switched to coaching. 
In 1977, he became the manager of the Cleveland Indians (a position he 
held for three years). He was a coach on the Yankees from 1979 to 1988. 
In 1989, Torborg left the Yankees to become the manager of the Chicago 
White Sox. A year after he took the helm, the White Sox won 94 games, which 
was a 25-game improvement from the team's 1989 season. For his efforts 
with the 1990 White Sox, Torborg won the American League Manager of the 
Year Award. Torborg would stay with the White Sox for one more year before 
moving to the New York Mets. Torborg wasn't as successful with the Mets 
as he was with the White Sox. A year after leading the White Sox to an 
87–75 record, Torborg's 1992 New York Mets posted a 70–92 record. After 
starting the 1993 season with a 13–25 record, the Mets fired Torborg and 
replaced him with Dallas Green. For the rest of the 1990s, Torborg kept 
busy working as a sportscaster for the likes of CBS Radio and Fox. Torborg 
returned to managing, first with the Montreal Expos in 2001 and then the 
Florida Marlins in 2002. In 2003, Torborg was fired from the Florida Marlins 
after they started off the season with a 16–22 record. Jack McKeon was 
hired to replace him and led the team to a 2003 World Series victory. Torborg 
then returned to broadcasting for Fox. He served as the color commentator 
for Atlanta Braves games on FSN South and Turner South in 2006, where he 
was partnered with Bob Rathbun. However, neither Torborg nor Rathbun was 
retained for the 2007 season.[4] Torborg is of Danish descent. His son, 
Dale, is a former professional wrestler and his daughter-in-law, Christie 
Wolf, is a bodybuilder and former professional wrestler. For more than 
25 years, Torborg lived with his family in a home in Mountainside, New 
Jersey.[5] Torborg currently has Parkinson's and no longer signs autographs.[6]
