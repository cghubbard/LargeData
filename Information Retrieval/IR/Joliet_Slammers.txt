The Joliet Slammers are a professional baseball team based in Joliet, Illinois, 
that play in the independent Frontier League. They play their home games 
at Silver Cross Field in Joliet. They replaced the Joliet JackHammers of 
the Northern League after the franchise was crippled by numerous financial 
issues. The JackHammers franchise was put up for sale and Steel City Baseball 
LLC bought out all assets, including the front office, the ticketing system, 
and the lease of the ballpark. The "Slammers" name refers to the famous 
prisons of Joliet and Will County (Joliet Correctional Center and Stateville 
Correctional Center) as well as a common baseball term. On September 18, 
2011, the Slammers were named Frontier League champions after defeating 
the River City Rascals, 6–5 in Joliet, taking the best-of-five Frontier 
League Championship Series three games to one. Following the 2012 season, 
the Slammers were purchased on October 15, 2012, by Joliet Community Baseball 
& Entertainment, LLC. The team's name, stadium, league and overall branding 
remain the same. Pitchers Utility player Catchers Infielders Outfielders
