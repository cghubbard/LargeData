Robert E. "Bob" Quinn (born 1936)[1] is a retired American professional 
baseball executive. Quinn spent almost 30 years in senior front office 
positions in Major League Baseball and worked as the general manager of 
three clubs: the New York Yankees (from June 8, 1988,[2] through October 
12, 1989), Cincinnati Reds[3] (from October 13, 1989, through the end of 
the 1992 season) and San Francisco Giants[4] (from December 1, 1992, through 
September 30, 1996). He was the general manager of the 1990 World Series 
champion Cincinnati Reds. Quinn is a third-generation member of a family 
involved in baseball management since the turn of the 20th century. His 
grandfather J.A. Robert Quinn at one time was an owner of the Boston Red 
Sox and Boston Braves and general manager of the St. Louis Browns and Brooklyn 
Dodgers. His father, John J. Quinn, was GM of the Braves in Boston and 
Milwaukee and the Philadelphia Phillies between 1945–72. A brother-in-law, 
Roland Hemond, is also a longtime baseball executive and the former general 
manager of the Chicago White Sox and Baltimore Orioles. And Quinn's son, 
also named Bob, is the Milwaukee Brewers' executive vice president, finance 
and administration,[5] the fourth generation of the Quinn family to work 
in senior management positions in professional baseball. Robert E. Quinn 
grew up in Newton, Massachusetts, and with his family moved to Milwaukee 
with the Braves in 1953.[6] He graduated from Marquette University in 1958[7] 
and, after beginning his baseball career in the Braves' minor league organization, 
he joined Milwaukee's current Major League team, the Brewers, as their 
farm system director in 1971.[1] In 1973, he accepted a similar post with 
the Cleveland Indians, and spent over a dozen years working as the Indians' 
scouting and player development boss. He was promoted to vice president 
in 1981.[1] In 1987, Quinn joined the Yankees as vice president, baseball 
administration. In May 1988, the Bombers' incumbent GM, Lou Piniella, turned 
in his resignation; on June 8, Quinn was named his successor. Not even 
two weeks into his tenure, Quinn faced a mutiny from the manager he inherited, 
Billy Martin.[8] Quinn had activated a catcher, Don Slaught, from the disabled 
list based on input from the Yankees' medical staff. Martin disagreed vehemently 
with the Slaught decision and announced he would boycott the team's management 
meetings.[8] Owner George Steinbrenner did not intercede on Martin's behalf, 
and Martin was replaced by Piniella as manager on June 23 with the Yankees 
40–28 and 2½ games behind the Detroit Tigers in the American League East 
Division. They went only 45–48 under Piniella to finish fifth in 1988, 
then posted a 74–87 mark in 1989, their first losing season since 1973, 
and Quinn resigned October 12. Quinn immediately succeeded Murray Cook 
as general manager of the Cincinnati Reds, and he proceeded to hire Piniella 
as his field manager. The 1989 Cincinnati season had been a disaster on 
and off the field: the Reds finished 75–87 and in fifth place in a year 
marred by the gambling allegations against and the suspension and disbarment 
of manager Pete Rose.[9] During that offseason, Quinn acquired fireballing 
relief pitcher Randy Myers and rookie first baseman Hal Morris. In 1990, 
Morris posted a .340 batting average and finished third in the National 
League Rookie of the Year balloting. Myers teamed with Rob Dibble and Norm 
Charlton to form The Nasty Boys, a formidable bullpen trio. The 1990 Reds 
won 91 games and the National League West Division championship, defeated 
the Pittsburgh Pirates in six games in the NLCS (with Morris hitting .417), 
and then swept the favored Oakland Athletics in the World Series behind 
The Nasty Boys' dominant relief work. Quinn was named "Executive of the 
Year" by The Sporting News in recognition of Cincinnati's 1990 turnaround. 
The Reds suffered a down season in 1991, falling to fifth place, but recovered 
to win 90 games in 1992, although they finished eight games behind the 
division champion Atlanta Braves. But there was turbulence in the Cincinnati 
front office. Owner Marge Schott cut Quinn's scouting and farm system budget, 
then fired Quinn at the end of the 1992 season.[10] Two months later, Quinn 
became general manager of the Giants at one of the turning points in their 
history in the San Francisco Bay Area. The 1992 Giants finished 72–90, 
26 games behind the Braves (and 18 games in arrears of Quinn's Reds) and 
had drawn 1.56 million fans to Candlestick Park—next to last in the National 
League. For much of the season, it appeared that the Giants were about 
to move to Tampa Bay after owner Bob Lurie agreed to sell them to Florida 
businessman Vince Naimoli. But in November, the National League rejected 
the Tampa deal, and Lurie instead sold the Giants to a Bay Area investment 
group headed by Peter Magowan. The new owners announced the team was staying 
in San Francisco, hired Quinn as general manager on December 1, 1992, signed 
free agent superstar left fielder Barry Bonds on December 9, and promoted 
Dusty Baker to manager on December 16. The 1993 Giants proceeded to improve 
by 31 games, going 103–59, Bonds won the NL Most Valuable Player Award, 
and attendance jumped to 2.6 million. However, the Giants finished a game 
behind the Braves in the NL West and did not qualify for the postseason 
in the last pre-wild card full season in Major League Baseball. Three sub-.500 
seasons followed the Giants' 1993 breakout year, and at the close of 1996, 
Quinn stepped down as general manager in favor of Brian Sabean, who had 
been the Yankees' director of scouting during Quinn's GM tenure, and who 
had been brought to the Giants by Quinn in 1993 as assistant general manager/director 
of player personnel and scouting. Under Sabean, GM from 1997 through 2014, 
the Giants would win three World Series championships and four National 
League pennants. Under Magowan they moved into AT&T Park in 2000 and solidified 
their popularity in the Bay Area. Quinn remained with the Giants as a vice 
president and senior adviser for one more season, through 1997.[1] He currently
