Daniel Paul "Danny" Valencia (born September 19, 1984) is an American professional 
baseball third baseman for the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He has also played for the Minnesota Twins, Boston Red Sox, Baltimore 
Orioles, Kansas City Royals, Toronto Blue Jays, and Oakland Athletics. 
In high school, Valencia was all-county three times and all-state twice. 
At the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, he was Southern Conference 
Freshman of the Year, second-team all-conference, and on his all-regional 
team. He was drafted while he was a junior at the University of Miami by 
the Twins in the 19th round of the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft, the 
576th player overall. In the minors, Valencia was an All-Star in the Appalachian 
League (2006), the Midwest League (2007), and the Florida State League 
(2008). He entered the 2010 season ranked as the sixth-best prospect of 
the Twins by Baseball America. Valencia made his major league debut with 
the Twins in June 2010. He was named the third baseman on Baseball America's 
2010 All-Rookie Team, and on the 2010 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star 
Team. In 2011, he led the Twins in RBIs, and led all major league third 
basemen in assists. In 2013, he batted .371 vs. left-handed pitching, leading 
the American League, and ranked third in slugging percentage at .639 (minimum 
100 plate appearances). Over the course of his career through 2016, he 
batted.321/.373/.500 against left-handed pitchers. Valencia is Jewish, 
and was born in Miami, Florida.[1] His parents are Mindy Valencia, who 
is Jewish, and Jewish Cuban immigrant Michael Valencia, who converted to 
Judaism.[1][2][3] He grew up in Boca Raton, Florida. He was raised Jewish, 
and has said: "People are shocked at first that I’m Jewish. I get teased 
in the clubhouse about being Jewish, but we all get teased about something. 
Going to Hebrew school and being a bar mitzvah … made my mom really happy. 
I wished I had been out playing baseball, but looking back at it now, I’m 
happy I did it.”[4][5][6][7] Valencia has a sister, Laura.[8][9][10][11][12] 
In 1996, Valencia pitched for the Boca Raton Babe Ruth League 12-and-under 
all-star baseball team that won the Florida state championship. The next 
year, he pitched and hit for the Boca Lightning 12-and-under travel baseball 
team that went 27–2 and won the South Florida All-Star Travel League championship.[13] 
His two key hitting coaches growing up were Bob Molinaro, a family friend 
who is a former major leaguer and Eastern League manager, and his mother 
Mindy.[14] Valencia played shortstop for four years for the Spanish River 
High School Sharks. He earned South Florida Sun-Sentinel All-County honors 
as a junior, and was named first team All-Palm Beach County three times 
and second-team All-State twice.[9][11][15][16] As a junior in 2002 he 
was Offensive Player of the Year after hitting .430, and as a senior in 
2003 he hit .575.[9] Although Valencia had dreamed of playing for the University 
of Miami, its baseball program did not recruit him, and instead he went 
to the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, one of two teams that 
had offered him a full baseball scholarship. In his freshman year, Valencia 
played third base and batted .338 with a .527 slugging percentage and a 
team-leading 8 home runs.[9][10][16] He was the 2004 Southern Conference 
Freshman of the Year, and was voted second-team All-Conference.[10] Homesick 
for Florida, Valencia sought to transfer to the University of Miami after 
his freshman year, even though it only offered him a modest scholarship. 
UNC-Greensboro initially agreed to release Valencia from his scholarship, 
but later refused, placing him in jeopardy of losing a year of college 
eligibility under NCAA Division I rules. He appealed to a university committee 
which ruled in his favor, allowing him to leave while preserving his eligibility.[10][12] 
During his sophomore year, Valencia played first base for the University 
of Miami Hurricanes alongside then-third-baseman Ryan Braun. He hit .300 
and drove in 63 runs while batting fifth in the lineup, and was named to 
the All-Regional Team.[17][18] By his sophomore year of college, he had 
added 40 pounds.[9][11][18][19] "It's night and day" from UNC-Greensboro, 
said Valencia. "It's awesome. It's what every Florida kid dreams of. It's 
the program–the winning, the uniforms. Everything from the strength coach 
to the facilities is completely different."[18] During the summer of 2005, 
he played third base for the Anchorage Glacier Pilots in the Alaska Baseball 
League.[15] When Braun left to join the Milwaukee Brewers' farm system 
in 2005, Valencia replaced him at third base for his junior year, batting 
.324 with a .475 slugging percentage.[15][20] Valencia hit .312 with 124 
runs batted in (RBIs) in 122 games over two years with the Hurricanes, 
and played in the College World Series.[14] Valencia then played seven 
games for the Orleans Cardinals in the Cape Cod League in the summer of 
2006.[21] Drafted in the 19th round of the 2006 draft by the Minnesota 
Twins, the 576th player overall, he skipped his senior year of college 
to begin his pro career.[22][23][24] Valencia was disappointed in his draft 
position, but said: "realistically, it does not change things for me. My 
goal has always been to get to the big leagues... It does not matter where 
you start, but where you finish."[25] In his first professional season, 
Valencia played first and third base with the Elizabethton Twins. He compiled 
a .311 batting average (ninth in the league, and fifth in the Twins' organization) 
and a .505 slugging percentage (sixth in the league), with eight home runs 
(fourth in the league) and 29 RBIs in 48 games. He was also fifth in the 
league in at-bats-per-home-run.[26] Valencia was named a 2006 Appalachian 
League Postseason All-Star, and then batted .364 in the playoffs.[27][28][29][29] 
Valencia was selected as a Midwest League All Star in 2007, while playing 
with the Beloit Snappers, for whom he batted .302/.374/.500.[24][30] His 
Beloit teammates nicknamed him "The Franchise".[31] Manager Jeff Smith 
lauded him for using the whole field when he batted, and for patience at 
the plate.[31] Immediately following the All Star game, he was promoted 
to the high A Fort Myers Miracle. He earned Florida State League (FSL) 
"Player of the Week" honors, batting .379 (11–29) with two home runs, three 
runs scored, and 10 RBIs for the week of July 16. He hit a combined .297/.354/.462 
with 17 homers and 66 RBIs at Beloit and Fort Myers.[32] Again assigned 
to the Miracle for the first half of 2008, he batted a league-leading .336 
with a league-leading 74 hits, and five home runs and 44 RBIs (second in 
the league), a .402 on-base percentage, and a .518 slugging percentage. 
He was named a Florida State League All Star, and helped the Miracle capture 
the FSL 2008 Western Division first half crown.[33][34][35] Jim Rantz, 
director of minor leagues for the Twins, said that he expected Valencia 
would hit for both power and average.[33] Valencia was promoted to the 
Twins' Double-A affiliate, the New Britain Rock Cats, for the second half 
of the season. With the Rock Cats, Valencia batted .289 with 10 home runs 
and 32 RBIs. Between the two teams, he batted .311 (sixth in the Twins' 
system), with 15 home runs and 76 RBIs (fourth in the Twins' system).[36][37] 
With the Rock Cats to start 2009, he was voted the Eastern League Player 
of the Week Award for the week ending May 24, after batting .444 with a 
.778 slugging percentage.[38] Rock Cats manager Tom Nieto said: "Danny's 
going to be a special player. He's got an electric bat."[14] He hit 38 
doubles during the season, tied for the most in the Twins' organization.[39] 
Following the season, he played 31 games of winter ball with the Arizona 
Fall League's Phoenix Desert Dogs. He spent spring training with the Twins 
in 2009 as a non-roster invitee, batting .429, and was assigned to New 
Britain following spring training.[40][41] Baseball America ranked him 
as the fifth-best prospect in the Twins' organization.[42] During the 2009 
season, Valencia first played for New Britain and was then promoted to 
the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings. He batted a combined .285 with 14 home 
runs and 70 RBIs for the two teams. The Twins management indicated that 
it felt that Valencia would be one of the top position players of the future.[43][44][45] 
On November 20, 2009, he was added to the Twins' 40-man roster.[46] Rantz 
said: "We're still trying to fill the third-base hole. Eventually ... we're 
all hoping that [Valencia will] be that guy."[47] He then played for the 
Indios de Mayagüez in the Puerto Rico winter league, and as a foreign-born 
player (of Cuban heritage) for Team Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Series.[48][49] 
Twins general manager Bill Smith said in December: "I give Danny Valencia 
credit. He's down in Puerto Rico right now playing winter ball, and trying 
to get better.... You always want an underdog guy, somebody to step up 
when presented with an opportunity."[50] Hector Otero, the Twins scout 
who signed Valencia and who was the general manager of the Mayagüez club, 
said: "I think he is a talented player. He definitely can throw. He worked 
on his defense–worked extra before games–and everyone knows he can swing 
the bat."[51] Valencia entered the 2010 season ranked as the Twins' sixth-best 
prospect by Baseball America.[52] Valencia began 2010 playing third base 
for Rochester, and was batting .292 in 48 games when he was called up by 
the parent club.[53] In 2013, Valencia batted .286 with 14 home runs and 
51 RBIs in 262 at bats with Triple-A Norfolk, and a .531 slugging percentage 
that would have ranked second in the International League if he had reached 
the minimum number of at bats.[54] Assessing Valencia's hitting during 
2010 spring training, Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said: “I guarantee you 
one thing, he can hit a fastball; and if he sits on a breaking ball, he 
can hit that, too.”[55] On June 3, Valencia was called up to replace Michael 
Cuddyer, who had been placed on the bereavement list following the death 
of his father-in-law.[56] In his debut that day, he went 1 for 3.[57][58] 
On July 26, Valencia hit a grand slam off reigning AL Cy Young winner Zack 
Greinke to record his first big league homer. The feat marked the first 
time in the 49 years of Twins franchise history that a player's first Major 
League home run was a grand slam. The game was also his first four-hit 
performance. The next day, Valencia became the first Twins rookie to have 
back-to-back games with four hits apiece. In 2010, Valencia hit .394 with 
runners in scoring position. That was best in the AL (ahead of Josh Hamilton), 
among those with at least 75 plate appearances in that situation.[4][59][60] 
On defense, he had the fifth-best fielding percentage among AL third basemen 
(.973).[61] For the season, his .311 batting average (the best by a Twins 
rookie in 46 years), .448 slugging percentage, and .799 OPS were the highest 
among AL rookies with 300 or more plate appearances.[4][62] He came in 
3rd among AL rookies in hits (93) and total bases (134).[62] In 65 games 
after the All Star break, he led AL rookies in batting (.311), RBIs (37), 
and doubles (16).[63] Valencia was named the third baseman on Baseball 
America's 2010 All-Rookie Team, and the third baseman on the 2010 Topps 
Major League Rookie All-Star Team.[64][65] He was also named the Twins' 
Most Outstanding Rookie (the Bill Boni Award).[66] He came in third in 
the voting for 2010 AL Rookie of the Year, with one second-place vote and 
nine third-place votes.[63] In 2011, Valencia batted .246, with 15 home 
runs and a team-leading 72 RBIs.[67][67] He also led the team in games 
played and at bats, and led the AL in games played at third base.[68] On 
defense, he led the all major league third basemen in assists, with 260.[69] 
In 2012, Valencia was replaced by Trevor Plouffe as the team's everyday 
third baseman after mediocre play during the season.[70] After Plouffe 
was placed on the DL, Valencia made his return to the Twins roster on July 
27. Valencia was hitting .205 with two home runs with the Twins when he 
was traded to the Boston Red Sox on August 5. Minnesota received minor 
league outfielder Jeremias Pineda in return.[71] The Red Sox immediately 
optioned Valencia to their Triple-A affiliate Pawtucket Red Sox. He was 
recalled from Pawtucket on August 11 when Will Middlebrooks was placed 
on the disabled list with a broken right wrist expected to end his season.[72] 
Valencia was sent back to Pawtucket on August 21,[73] before being recalled 
again on September 25.[74] He remained with the major league club for the 
rest of the season, while appearing in six games. On November 20, Valencia 
was designated for assignment along with four other Red Sox players.[75] 
Valencia was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for cash considerations eight 
days later, on November 28, 2012.[76] Valencia was recalled from the Triple-A 
Norfolk Tides on August 19, 2013.[77] He batted .304 for the season, with 
a .553 slugging percentage.[78] He batted .371 vs. left-handed pitching, 
leading the American League, and ranked third in slugging percentage at 
.639 (minimum 100 plate appearances).[68] He was eligible for arbitration 
after the season.[79] Valencia was traded to the Kansas City Royals for 
OF David Lough on December 18, 2013.[80] On May 22, 2014, Valencia was 
given the starting third baseman job by the Royals, after hitting .308 
in his first 16 games.[81] He batted .282 in 110 at bats, before being 
traded.[82] On July 28, 2014, Valencia was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays 
for pitcher Liam Hendriks and catcher Erik Kratz.[83] In the offseason, 
Valencia won his salary arbitration case against the Blue Jays, and was 
awarded a one-year contract worth $1.675 million.[84] On August 1, 2015, 
Valencia was designated for assignment.[85] The Oakland Athletics claimed 
Valencia off waivers on August 3, 2015.[86] He debuted with the team on 
August 5, starting at third base.[87] In 2015 he had a .345 on-base percentage 
with 18 home runs between the A's and Blue Jays.[88] In August 2016, Valencia 
was involved in a clubhouse fight with Billy Butler. Both players were 
fined, but neither was suspended, and Butler was released the following 
month.[89][90] In 2016, Valencia batted .287 (.318 against left-handers)/.346/.446 
with 22 doubles, 17 home runs (third on the team), and 51 RBIs in 517 plate 
appearances.[91][92][93] He played first base, third base, right field, 
and left field.[94] He earned $3.15 million.[95] Over the course of his 
career through 2016, he batted.321/.373/.500 against left-handed pitchers.[96] 
In 2017 he will be in his final season of arbitration, with the possibility 
of becoming a free agent after the season is over.[97] On November 12, 
2016, Valencia was traded to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for pitcher 
Paul Blackburn.[98] General manager Jerry Dipoto said: "What we see is 
primarily is shared time at first base with [Dan Vogelbach], give a day 
off or DH day at third base for [Kyle Seager], which is something we haven’t 
had the flexibility to do and (Valencia) can also go play either corner 
(outfield) spot. He’s a flexible corner piece that we see as an every day 
or near every day player, using him at a variety of different positions... 
Last year, he had 500-plus plate appearances. We envision a similar type
