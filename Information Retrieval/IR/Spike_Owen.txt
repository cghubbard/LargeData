Spike Dee Owen (born April 19, 1961 in Cleburne, Texas) is a former shortstop 
in Major League Baseball (whose first name comes from his mother Margie's 
maiden name which was Spikes) played for the Seattle Mariners (1983–86), 
Boston Red Sox (1986–88), Montreal Expos (1989–92), New York Yankees (1993) 
and California Angels (1994–95). He made his major league debut on June 
25, 1983. In his 13 seasons in the majors, he hit for a .246 batting average 
with 46 home runs and 439 RBIs in 1544 games. A switch-hitter, he attended 
The University of Texas at Austin and was the All-Tournament Team shortstop 
in the 1982 College World Series. He was drafted by the Seattle Mariners 
in the first round (the sixth overall pick) of the 1982 amateur draft. 
On June 25, 1983 he went 1 for 4 against the Toronto Blue Jays in his major 
league debut with the Mariners. His first hit came off Jim Gott. On July 
13, 1983, he hit his first big league home run against Boston Red Sox pitcher 
Doug Bird at Fenway Park. In 1986, he was named team captain of the Mariners.[1] 
On August 19, Owen and center fielder Dave Henderson were traded to the 
Boston Red Sox for Rey Quiñones and cash. In his third game with the Red 
Sox, he tied a major league record with six runs scored in a game. In the 
1986 American League Championship Series, he hit .429 as the Red Sox, one 
scant strike away from elimination in Game 5, came back (starting with 
Henderson's go-ahead homer against closer Donnie Moore) and upended the 
California Angels 4 games to 3. In the 1986 World Series he hit .300 in 
a Boston loss to the New York Mets 4 games to 3 after having the Mets down 
to their last strike twice in extra innings of Game 6. On December 8, 1988, 
the Red Sox traded him to the Montreal Expos for pitcher John Dopson and 
shortstop Luís Rivera. In 1990, he set a National League record with 63 
consecutive errorless games at shortstop. Despite hitting only .234, he 
showed some decent power with 24 doubles, five triples and five home runs 
among his 106 hits. Patience at the plate was the secret of his success 
with 70 walks (12 intentional), for a respectable .333 on-base percentage—walks 
are important for an eighth-place hitter in the NL since there is no designated 
hitter, the usually weak-hitting pitcher bats ninth, and the top of the 
order starts the next inning if the pitcher makes the last out. Or if the 
pitcher bats with less than two out, he can make a productive out by bunting 
the runner(s) over. Owen's most productive season was 1992, with career 
highs in average (.269), home runs (7), stolen bases (7) and slugging percentage 
(.381). In addition, he had a healthy .348 on-base percentage and hit well 
in the clutch at .319 in 91 at-bats with runners in scoring position. He 
also led the NL in fielding percentage twice. A hard-nosed competitor, 
he quickly established himself as a leader in the Montreal clubhouse and 
helped rookie Delino DeShields transition to second base. After the 1992 
season, Owen was supplanted as Montreal shortstop by the emergence of Wil 
Cordero and became a free agent. On December 4, 1992, he signed a three-year 
contract with the New York Yankees, aspiring to anchor their infield and 
provide team leadership, but in 1993 he led a horde of AL middle infielders 
in one category and one only; i.e., salary. Not surprisingly, the Yanks 
traded him after 1993 to the California Angels for a mere minor leaguer. 
In 1994 he hit a career-high .310 in 82 games for the Angels, basically 
as an infield backup and eventually as a DH. In 1996, he was demoted to 
the Texas Rangers' Triple A affiliate, the Oklahoma City 89ers and soon 
afterward, still in April, announced his retirement. From 2002 to 2006, 
Owen served as bench coach of the Round Rock Express, formerly the Triple-A 
affiliate of the Houston Astros. He was the manager of the High Desert 
Mavericks, a Class A – Advanced affiliate of the Texas Rangers in 2015, 
where he guided the team to a 78-62 record and a second-half South Division 
title in the California League. After the 2015 season, Owen was named to 
manage the Hickory Crawdads,[2] a Class A affiliate of the Texas Rangers, 
however he was called up to the Rangers in February 2016 to serve as interim 
third base coach while third base coach Tony Beasley underwent chemotherapy 
treatment for cancer.[3][4] His older brother, Dave, played for the Chicago 
Cubs in 1984–85. In 2003, the Spike Owen Memorial Ballpark in Bay Village, 
Ohio, the site of several games of MLB Showdown, a card game created by 
Wizards of the Coast, was named after him by Michael Eller, a former Bay 
Village resident who is both a fan of Owen and an avid Showdown player.
