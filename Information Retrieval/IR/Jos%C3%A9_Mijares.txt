José Manuel Mijares (born October 29, 1984) is a Venezuelan professional 
baseball pitcher who is a free agent. Mijares has pitched in Major League 
Baseball for the Minnesota Twins, Kansas City Royals, and San Francisco 
Giants. Mijares signed with the Twins as a free agent on March 2, 2002 
and bounced around every level of the Twins' farm system—having risen as 
high as the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings in 2007. He was awarded the Gulf 
Coast League Rolaids Relief Man Award in 2004 and elected as an All-Star 
in the Eastern League in 2007. On January 24, 2008, he was re-signed to 
a one-year deal, and on March 9, 2008, he was cut from spring training 
and optioned to the Double-A New Britain Rock Cats of the Eastern League. 
He also spent part of the 2008 season with the Gulf Coast League Twins 
and Fort Myers Miracle before ended the minor league season again assigned 
to the Rock Cats.[1] In September 2008, Mijares received a call up to the 
Minnesota Twins, and made his major league debut on September 13 against 
the Baltimore Orioles. The Twins won that game 12–6. Mijares wound up becoming 
the Twins main set-up man for the remainder of the season. Following a 
rocky 2009 spring training camp, he was reassigned to Rochester.[2] On 
April 20, Twins set-up man Jesse Crain went on the fifteen-day disabled 
list with shoulder inflammation, and Mijares was brought back up to the 
big club to fill the roster spot.[3] In his first appearance of the season, 
he pitched a perfect eighth inning in Boston in the Twins' 7–3 loss to 
the Red Sox. On December 12, 2011, Mijares was non-tendered by the Twins. 
The Kansas City Royals signed Mijares to a one-year contract on December 
21, 2011.[4] He had a 2.56 ERA and a 1.267 WHIP with the Royals, Mijares 
was claimed off waivers by the San Francisco Giants on August 6, 2012.[5] 
He pitched in 27 games with the Giants in 2012, going 1-0 with a 2.55 ERA 
in 27 appearances. He pitched in 6 games in the postseason, including in 
Game 1 of the World Series. He gave up 3 runs in 2.2 innings with 3 strikeouts. 
Mijares won his first world series with the San Francisco Giants in 2012. 
Mijares pitched 2013 in the Giants bullpen. He was placed on the bereavement 
list on April 29 after the passing of his grandmother, and he wound up 
on the restricted list after not arriving to the game on May 6 in time.[6] 
He was activated the next day. His first half was very solid, going 0-2 
with 4 holds and a 2.45 in 33 innings. His August was very rocky, giving 
up 12 runs (11 earned) in 11 innings (13 games). He pitched in only 5 games 
in September, including going 3 appearances in a row without retiring a 
batter. After the Giants re-signed Javier López to a contract on November 
26, a place on the 40-man roster was needed. Mijares was the casualty; 
he choose free agency. Mijares would have been a non-tender candidate come 
the arbitration deadline.[7] On January 24, 2014 the Boston Red Sox signed 
Mijares to a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training.[8] 
He opted out of his deal and became a free agent on March 23, 2014. On 
December 24, 2014, the Cincinnati Reds signed Mijares to a minor league 
deal.[9] On March 23, 2015, Mijares was released by the Reds.[10] Mijares 
throws a fastball that hits 91–94 mph and can touch 95. He also throws 
a hard curveball in the upper 70s and a mid 80s slider.[citation needed]
