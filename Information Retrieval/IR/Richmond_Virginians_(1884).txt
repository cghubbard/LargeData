The Richmond Virginians was a major league baseball team that played in 
the American Association in 1884. The Virginians thereby became the first 
major league team in the Old Confederacy, as well as the last one until 
the establishment of the Houston Astros in 1962. The Virginians had a record 
of 12 wins and 30 losses after replacing the Washington Statesmen, who 
had dropped out of the league. The Virginians were managed by Felix Moses 
and played their home games in Allen Pasture.[1] The Virginians began their 
existence in the Eastern League in 1884. When the Statesmen folded on August 
2, the Virginians were brought into the American Association to complete 
their schedule. They played their first game on August 5 against the Philadelphia 
Athletics, losing 14-0.[2] They won their first game on August 7, defeating 
the Brooklyn Atlantics.[2] They finished the season with two losses to 
the Toledo Blue Stockings to bring their record to 12-30.[2] After the 
season, the AA contracted from 12 teams to 8, with the Virginians being 
one of the eliminated teams. The Virginians returned to the Eastern League,
