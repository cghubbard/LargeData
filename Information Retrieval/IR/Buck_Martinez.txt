As player As manager John Albert "Buck" Martinez (born November 7, 1948) 
is an American former professional baseball catcher and manager, and is 
currently the television play-by-play announcer for the Toronto Blue Jays. 
He played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Kansas City 
Royals, the Milwaukee Brewers, and the Toronto Blue Jays.[1] Since the 
end of his playing career, he has been a broadcaster, working on the Blue 
Jays and Baltimore Orioles radio and television broadcasts, and nationally 
for TBS. Martinez managed the Toronto Blue Jays from 2001 to May 2002 and 
Team USA at the inaugural World Baseball Classic in 2006.[2] He attended 
Elk Grove High School, Sacramento City College, Sacramento State University, 
and Southwest Missouri State University. Martinez made his major league 
debut in 1969, playing 72 games with the Kansas City Royals. He is mentioned 
in Jim Bouton's 1970 bestseller Ball Four as John Martinez, a player Bouton 
and his Seattle teammates know little about. During a meeting, as Bouton's 
team is devising strategies to effectively pitch to their opponents, manager 
Joe Schultz lacks any concrete suggestions about the rookie Martinez, and 
famously advises that they just "zitz" him. Over the next few years, however, 
Martinez developed the reputation of being an offensive liability. He never 
appeared in more than 95 games during his time with Kansas City, through 
1977. Martinez was traded twice over the next few years, including to the 
Milwaukee Brewers in late 1977. In the midst of an 18–8 loss to Kansas 
City on Wednesday, August 29, 1979, Martinez entered the game as the Brewers 
sixth pitcher of the day. As a pitcher, Martinez batted in the 9th inning, 
stroking an RBI single. For Martinez, who played in over 1,000 ML games, 
this game was his lone appearance in the majors as a pitcher.[3] Martinez 
was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays May 10, 1981 after being designated 
for assignment. He is most remembered for his time in Toronto, where he 
twice hit 10 home runs (in 1982 and 1983) and was regarded as a solid defensive 
catcher. Martinez's career took a bad turn when he broke his leg and severely 
dislocated his ankle in a home plate collision with the Seattle Mariners' 
Phil Bradley at the Kingdome on July 9, 1985. After the collision, he still 
attempted to throw out the advancing runner Gorman Thomas. When the throw 
went into left field, Thomas tried to come home. However, he was tagged 
out by a sprawled-out Martinez, who despite having a broken leg had managed 
to catch the return throw from George Bell on the ground, thus completing 
a 9–2–7–2 double play. Martinez attempted a comeback with Toronto in 1986 
but retired after hitting only .181 in 81 games. After retiring as an active 
player following the 1986 season, Martinez began his broadcasting career 
as a radio color analyst for Toronto Blue Jays games in 1987. Eventually, 
this led to a job with TSN in which he was first paired with Fergie Olver. 
When Olver was replaced by Jim Hughson in 1990, Martinez remained the color 
analyst. The pair of Hughson and Martinez also worked together on a number 
of ESPN telecasts, as well as on EA Sports Triple Play Baseball video game 
series. Hughson left TSN in 1994, and was replaced by Dan Shulman. Like 
Hughson, Shulman also frequently moonlighted on ESPN and eventually joined 
ESPN full-time, whereas Martinez became manager of the Blue Jays from 2001 
to 2002. For the 2003 to 2009 seasons, he was the color commentator for 
Baltimore Orioles television broadcasts, alongside play-by-play announcers 
Jim Hunter and Gary Thorne on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network. From 2005 
to 2009, Martinez was a co-host of XM Radio's Baseball This Morning show 
on the MLB Home Plate channel and contributed color commentary for Sunday 
afternoon games and on TBS, as well as for the network's postseason coverage. 
In late April 2009, Buck substituted for the ill Jerry Remy as commentator 
for the three game Red Sox–Rays series for NESN. Martinez returned to the 
Blue Jays' broadcast booth in 2010, this time as a play-by-play announcer 
for their sister company and exclusive broadcaster, Rogers Sportsnet, replacing 
Jamie Campbell, who now hosts the pre-game telecast. His main broadcast 
partner on Sportsnet is former Blue Jay Pat Tabler. With Shulman's part-time 
return to the Blue Jays broadcast team in 2016, Martinez now splits duties 
between play-by-play and color analyst.[4] On September 25, 2014, Rogers 
announced Martinez had signed a five-year extension to remain the play-by-play 
announcer for Toronto.[5] Martinez is also expected to participate in the 
MLB International broadcast of the 2016 World Series.[6] In 2000, Martinez 
was hired as Toronto's manager after Jim Fregosi's contract was not renewed. 
Martinez's energetic attitude was seen as the right fit for the Jays' young 
roster and through the first two months of the season Toronto outperformed 
expectations. The success, however, was short-lived as the team struggled 
through the remainder of the season and finished a mediocre 80–82. He was 
fired 53 games into the 2002 season after posting a 20–33 record. Ironically, 
at the time he was fired, the Blue Jays were on a three-game winning streak, 
having just swept the Detroit Tigers. He was replaced as manager by Carlos 
Tosca. Martinez was selected as the field manager for Team USA in the 2006 
inaugural World Baseball Classic. He led the superstar-laden American squad 
to the second round. While Martinez wore number 13 as both a player and 
a manager in the Major Leagues, he wore number 31 while managing in the 
WBC because Alex Rodriguez had already been assigned number 13. Martinez 
and his wife Arlene have one son Casey, a 47th round pick by Toronto in 
the 2000 First Year Player Draft.[7] They reside in Clearwater, Florida. 
Martinez has authored two books. In 1985 From Worst To First: The Toronto 
Blue Jays in 1985 was published, and in 2016 Martinez released his second 
book entitled Change Up, outlining his views on modern-day baseball and
