The 2014 Pittsburgh Pirates season was the franchise's 128th season as 
a member of the National League, 133rd season overall, and 14th season 
at PNC Park. The regular season began with a win at home against the Chicago 
Cubs on March 31 and ended with a loss at Great American Ball Park against 
the Cincinnati Reds on September 28. The Pirates finished the regular season 
in second place for the second consecutive year in the National League 
Central Division with 88 wins and 74 losses. The team clinched their second 
consecutive playoff berth with a victory on September 23. Also for the 
second consecutive season, however, the Pirates finished in second in their 
division behind the defending National League champion St. Louis Cardinals. 
The team secured one of two NL Wild Card spots, as well as home field advantage 
for the 2014 National League Wild Card Game. However, they lost the October 
1 playoff game to the San Francisco Giants, thus eliminating them from 
the 2014 postseason. Three members of the 2014 Pirates were selected to 
represent the National League in the All-Star Game. In addition, two Pirates 
players were named NL Player of the Month: Andrew McCutchen in June and 
Josh Harrison in August. During the 2014 season, the franchise season attendance 
record (2,435,867, set during PNC Park's inaugural 2001 season) was broken 
on September 21, the final home game of the season and 23rd sellout of 
the year (tying the franchise sellout record set in 2013). The new record 
stood at 2,442,564 until being broken in the 2015 season.[2] Infielders
