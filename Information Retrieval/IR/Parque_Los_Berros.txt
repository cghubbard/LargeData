Parque Los Berros, in Xalapa, Veracruz, is located a short distance to 
the southeast of the center of town, in the neighbourhood of the Stadium. 
Its name was derived from an edible herb called "berros" (garden cress) 
that used to grow in the area. Throughout the 19th century, the place would 
turn into a mosquito-infested marshland during the Summer rainy season. 
The rest of the year, it was occasionally used for horse-racing, as is 
shown in an engraving published in Historia Antigua de Jalapa by Manuel 
Rivera y Cambas, in 1871. It was on this site, most probably the army campground, 
around April 20, 1847, that members of the Fourth Illinois Infantry Regiment 
played the first game of baseball in México, as gathered from oral tradition 
and recorded in a 1909 publication, perhaps the first ever played outside 
the U.S. As a bat, they used the "wooden peg leg" of Antonio López de Santa 
Anna that they had captured a day or so before, at the Battle of Cerro 
Gordo.[1] Coordinates: 19°31′25″N 96°55′01″W﻿ / ﻿19.52361°N 96.91694°W﻿
