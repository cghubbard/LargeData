Donald Alvin Buford (born February 2, 1937) is a former Major League Baseball 
player. An infielder/outfielder, the switch-hitting Buford played for the 
Chicago White Sox (1963–67) and Baltimore Orioles (1968–72). Born in Linden, 
Texas and raised in Los Angeles, Buford, after graduating from Susan Miller 
Dorsey High School, played college baseball at the University of Southern 
California under legendary coach Rod Dedeaux. In 1958 he played on the 
Trojans' College World Series championship team with Ron Fairly and future 
baseball executive Pat Gillick. Buford was also a running back on the USC 
football team. His sons Don Buford, Jr. and Damon Buford also played for 
the USC Trojans. Buford is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity. In 2008, 
Buford was inducted into the International League Triple A Hall of Fame. 
In 2001, Buford was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame. In 1993, 
Buford was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame In his major 
league career, Buford batted .264 with 93 home runs, 418 RBIs, 718 runs 
scored and 200 stolen bases in 1286 games played. Primarily a leadoff hitter, 
he grounded into only 34 double plays during his big-league career (4553 
at bats) and holds the Major League Record for the lowest GIDP rate, averaging 
one in every 138 at bats. His career total is two fewer than Jim Rice's 
single-season record of 36, set in 1984, and 316 fewer than Cal Ripken's 
career record mark of 350 GIDP's. Note: A leadoff hitter faces less double 
play situations, but Buford did not lead off every game in his career. 
He broke into the majors as an infielder who played both second base and 
third base, becoming the White Sox’ regular at the former position in 1965 
(after sharing the position with Al Weis in 1964) and the latter in 1966. 
In the latter year, he stole a career-high 51 bases (one fewer than the 
American League leader, Bert Campaneris) and led the AL in sacrifice hits 
with 17, while establishing himself as one of the league's top leadoff 
hitters. In 1967 Buford and Ken Berry tied for the team lead with .241 
batting average on a White Sox team that battled the Boston Red Sox, Detroit 
Tigers and Minnesota Twins for the American League pennant, which the Red 
Sox won on the final day of the regular season. The White Sox were eliminated 
from pennant contention (perhaps due, in large part, to faulty offense; 
they led the Majors with a 2.45 earned run average, but batted only .225) 
in the final week of the season after losing a doubleheader to the lowly 
Kansas City Athletics on September 27. After the 1967 season the White 
Sox traded Buford to Baltimore in the same deal that sent Luis Aparicio 
back to the White Sox. In 1968 Buford batted .282 with 15 home runs in 
a lineup that also featured the likes of Frank Robinson, Brooks Robinson, 
Boog Powell, Davey Johnson and Paul Blair. In 1969 Buford hit a career-high 
.291 as the Orioles won the American League pennant. In the first game 
of the World Series against the New York Mets, Buford hit a leadoff home 
run against fellow ex-USC Trojan Tom Seaver—the first-ever home run to 
lead off a World Series. (Dustin Pedroia is the only other player to lead 
off a World Series with a home run, which he did with the Boston Red Sox 
in the 2007 World Series.) Buford also drove in another run with a double 
as the Orioles won 4-1. However, he went 0-for-16 over the next four games, 
all won by the Mets for a seemingly impossible Series victory. In 1970 
Buford batted .272 with 17 home runs and a career high 109 walks. The Orioles 
gained redemption in the World Series, which they won over the Cincinnati 
Reds in five games. Buford, playing in four of those games, went 4-for-15, 
including a home run in Game Three, which Baltimore won 9-3. In 1971 Buford 
batted .290 with a career-high 19 home runs. He was also selected to the 
All-Star team for the only time in his career. Again the Orioles went to 
the World Series; this time, however, the Pittsburgh Pirates defeated them 
in seven games. Buford collected six hits in this Series; two of them were 
home runs. In each of the Orioles’ three pennant-winning seasons Buford 
scored 99 runs, leading the American League in that category in 1971. Buford 
was the first Baltimore Oriole to homer from both sides of the plate in 
the same game. He accomplished this feat on April 9, 1970 in a 13-1 win 
over the Cleveland Indians. Buford also had the dubious distinction of 
being the first Oriole ever to strike out five times in one game, on August 
26, 1971.[1] However, his Orioles defeated his former team, the Chicago 
White Sox, 8–7. After the 1971 season the Orioles played an exhibition 
series in Japan. After slumping to .206 in 1972 Buford returned to Japan, 
where he had been known as "The Greatest Leadoff Man in the World" during 
the Orioles’ tour, to play professionally. In four seasons, from 1973 to 
1976, he hit .270 with 65 home runs. In 1973 and 1974 voted to top 9 Best 
Players in Japan. Played in All-Star Games receiving Honors. In 2006, Buford 
was the manager of the Daytona Cubs of the Florida State League. He had 
also served on Frank Robinson's coaching staff with the Orioles, San Francisco 
Giants and Washington Nationals. Previously, he had front office and other 
minor league positions with the Orioles. Managed Rookie League Team (Bluefield). 
Managed A (Aberdeen,MD), Managed high A (Frederick,MD), Managed AA (Bowie), 
Assistant Farm Director, Farm Director, all for the Orioles. Buford's son 
Damon Buford also played in the major leagues, playing with the Orioles, 
Mets, Texas Rangers, Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs from 1993 to 2001. 
Buford's oldest son Don Buford, Jr. also played professional baseball in 
the Baltimore Orioles organization for four years. He is now an internationally 
recognized orthopedic surgeon specializing in sports medicine and shoulder 
surgery. Buford remains one of the most respected individuals to ever teach 
the game of baseball. His number 9 was retired by the Daytona Cubs after 
the 2006 season. In October, 2012 Don Buford, Sr. accepted a new position 
managing Major League Baseball's Urban Youth Academy in Compton, California. 
The academy focuses on baseball and softball training and education and 
is free to participants. He is now working on his own Community Organization,
