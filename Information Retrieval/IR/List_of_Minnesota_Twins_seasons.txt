The Minnesota Twins, formerly the Washington Senators, are a professional 
baseball franchise currently based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. They currently 
play in the American League (AL) Central division. The Twins have won three 
World Series in 1924, 1987 and 1991, the first of which occurred when they 
were still based in Washington. As the Senators, they struggled between 
the 1920s and 1950s. The team enjoyed success in their early years in Minnesota, 
reaching the World Series in 1965 with stars like Harmon Killebrew and 
Jim Kaat on the roster. However, from 1971 to 1986, the Twins failed to 
reach the postseason. The Twins had eight straight losing seasons from 
1993 to 2000, but this was followed by one the franchise's most consistent 
period of success when the team only had one losing season (2007) between 
2001 and 2010. Despite the team's success during this period, the Twins 
failed to reach another World Series. Since the 2011 season, the franchise 
has fallen substantially, finishing with a losing record in every season 
with the exception of the 2015 season. This decline was capped by the franchise's 
only sixth (and first since 1982) 100-loss season. The following table 
describes the Twins' MLB winâ€“loss record by decade. These statistics are
