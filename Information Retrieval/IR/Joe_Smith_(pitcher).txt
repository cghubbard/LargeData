Joseph Michael Smith (born March 22, 1984) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the New York Mets, Cleveland Indians, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 
and Chicago Cubs. Smith is 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) and weighs 215 pounds 
(98 kg). He attended Wright State University and was drafted by the Mets 
in the third round of the 2006 amateur draft. Smith was the second player 
from the 2006 draft to make it to the major leagues. A three-year varsity 
letterman at Amelia High School and a Division I All-Fort Ancient Valley 
Conference honoree, Smith also pitched five years for the select American 
Amateur Baseball Congress Midland team in Cincinnati. Even through his 
labrum surgery he was dedicated to return to baseball. In college he was 
redshirted and played three years in the Horizon League. Ultimately, Smith 
became Wright State's closer his junior and senior year, as he gained 4–6 mph 
on his fastball after changing his delivery.[citation needed] He had 13 
saves his senior season and a 0.98 ERA. In three seasons Smith posted 22 
saves, 145 strikeouts, and 39 walks. In 2005 he was the WSU team MVP and 
in 2006 he was awarded second team All-Mideast Region, first team Horizon 
League, Horizon League Pitcher of the Year and WSU Most Valuable Male Athlete. 
In the late summer of 2004, Smith played summer ball with the NECBL with 
the North Adams Steeplecats. In 2005, Smith briefly pitched for the Rockville 
Express, a team in the Cal Ripken, Sr. Collegiate Baseball League In 2005 
he made nine appearances for the Express, posting a 4.66 ERA, a 1–0 record 
and earning two saves.[1] Later in the summer of 2005, Smith also pitched 
for the Edenton Steamers in the Coastal Plain League. In 16 regular season 
appearances, totaling 17.1 innings, he tallied nine saves with a 2.08 ERA, 
.197 batting average against, and struck out 19 batters. He also recorded 
the final out of the 2005 Petitt Cup tournament, on a comebacker, to give 
Edenton its second consecutive league championship. Less than two years 
later, Smith became the first Steamers' alumnus to appear in the majors. 
Smith first began his career with Brooklyn (A) of the New York–Penn League 
by allowing two runs, one earned, in one inning of work against the Staten 
Island Yankees on June 21. He was named one of the top 20 prospects in 
the New York–Penn League by Baseball America. When Duaner Sánchez was hurt 
during a taxi cab incident in 2006, Mets general manager Omar Minaya considered 
recalling Smith to the Majors. Instead, the Mets traded for Roberto Hernández 
and Óliver Pérez to give Smith more time in the minors[citation needed]. 
On March 24, 2007, after a strong spring training, it was announced Smith 
would be on the Mets' 25-man roster. On April 1, 2007, Smith made his major 
league debut. He struck out one (Preston Wilson) and walked one (Albert 
Pujols). He also gave up a single to David Eckstein. Smith earned his first 
major league win on April 24, 2007 after coming on in relief in the 12th 
inning.[2] Smith enjoyed much success in the beginning of 2007, but began 
to tire and was sent down to the minors at mid year. Smith was with the 
Mets for all of the 2008 season, enjoying varied success. He went 6–3 in 
63.3 innings with a 3.55 ERA. On December 10, 2008, Smith was traded by 
the Mets to the Cleveland Indians as part of a twelve-player, three-team 
deal.[3] On January 18, 2013, the Cleveland Indians announced they had 
avoided arbitration with Smith, signing him to a one-year contract worth 
$3.15 million.[4] Smith became a free agent following the 2013 season, 
but expressed interest in remaining with the Tribe.[5] On November 24, 
2013, Smith reportedly agreed to a three-year contract for $15 million 
with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, pending the completion of a physical.[6] 
On November 27, 2013, the Angels confirmed that the team and Smith agreed 
to the terms.[7] On April 25, 2014, Smith was named the Angels' new closer 
after multiple struggles by former closer Ernesto Frieri. After the Angels 
traded for San Diego Padres' All-Star closer Huston Street on July 18, 
2014, Smith was moved to an eighth-inning setup role. Smith finished with 
15 saves in 76 games to the tune of a 1.81 ERA. Smith's numbers in 2015 
went up as his ERA and WHIP from the previous season. On June 8, 2016, 
Smith went on the disabled list with a hamstring injury. On August 1, 2016, 
the Angels traded Smith to the Chicago Cubs for prospect Jesus Castillo.[8] 
In 16 more appearances with the Cubs to finish 2016, Smith had a 1-1 record 
and a 2.51 ERA. Overall in 2016, combined with both teams he played for, 
Smith made 54 total appearances with a 1-4 record and a 3.82 ERA. Smith 
was a member of the Cubs' 2016 World Series championship team, but did 
not make any postseason appearances.[9] Smith's pitching style is different 
from most. According to hitters, he comes at the batter from third base. 
His release point is about 8:30 on the analog clock, lower than side armed, 
and higher than submarine.[10] Smith's fastball usually is at 88–90 mph 
and has been known to hit 93 mph. His fastball can even be considered a 
sinker because of its hard downward movement. He routinely gets ground 
balls because of this. Smith also throws a slider and a changeup. Smith 
is married to Allie LaForce of CBS. In 2012, Smith's mother was diagnosed 
with an inherited disease known as Huntington's disease; the condition 
leads to the death of nerve cells in the brain. Smith has a 50 percent 
chance of inheriting the condition and says that he will be tested for
