Erie /ˈɪəri/ is a city in northwestern Pennsylvania, United States. Named 
for the lake and the Native American tribe that resided along its southern 
shore, Erie is the state's fourth-largest city (after Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, 
and Allentown), with a population of 101,786 at the 2010 census,[2] and 
an estimated population of 99,452 in 2014.[3] It was the third-largest 
city in the state until 1999. It is the second largest city in Western 
Pennsylvania (after Pittsburgh) and the largest city in northwestern Pennsylvania.[4] 
Erie's metropolitan area, equivalent to all of Erie County, consists of 
approximately 280,000 residents. The city is the seat of government for 
Erie County and the principal city of the Erie, PA Metropolitan Statistical 
Area. Erie is between Buffalo, New York, Cleveland, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania. Once teeming with heavy industry, Erie's manufacturing sector 
remains prominent in the local economy, though service industries, health 
care, higher education, and tourism are emerging as greater economic drivers. 
Hundreds of thousands visit Erie for recreation at Presque Isle State Park, 
as well as attractions like the casino and horse racetrack named for the 
state park. Erie is known as the "Flagship City" because of its status 
as the home port of Oliver Hazard Perry's flagship Niagara.[5] The city 
has also been called the "Gem City" because of the sparkling lake.[5] Erie 
won the All-America City Award in 1972. Cultures of indigenous peoples 
occupied the shoreline and bluffs in this area for thousands of years, 
taking advantage of the rich resources. The Sommerheim Park Archaeological 
District in Millcreek Township, Pennsylvania west of the city, includes 
artifacts from the Archaic period in the Americas, as well as from the 
Early and Middle Woodland Period, roughly a span from 8,000BCE to 500CE. 
The historic Iroquoian-speaking Erie Nation occupied this area before being 
defeated by the five nations of the Iroquois Confederacy in the 17th century 
during the Beaver Wars. The Iroquois tribes had developed and five nations 
formed a political league in the 1500s, adding their sixth nation in the 
early 18th century. The Erie area became controlled by the Seneca, "keeper 
of the western door" of the Iroquois, who were largely based in present-day 
New York. Europeans first arrived as settlers in the region when the French 
constructed Fort Presque Isle near present-day Erie in 1753, as part of 
their effort to defend New France against the encroaching British colonists. 
The name of the fort refers to the peninsula that juts into Lake Erie, 
now protected as Presque Isle State Park. The French term "presque-isle" 
means peninsula (literally, "almost an island"). When the fort was abandoned 
by the French in 1760 during the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War), 
it was the last post they held west of Niagara. The British established 
a garrison at the fort at Presque Isle that same year, three years before 
the end of the French and Indian War.[6] Present-day Erie is situated in 
what was the disputed Erie Triangle, a triangle of land claimed after the 
American Revolutionary War by the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut 
(as part of its Western Reserve), and Massachusetts. It officially became 
part of Pennsylvania on March 3, 1792, after Connecticut, Massachusetts 
and New York relinquished their claims to the federal government, which 
in turn sold the land to Pennsylvania for 75 cents per acre or a total 
of $151,640.25 in Continental currency. The Iroquois released the land 
to Pennsylvania in January 1789 for payments of $2,000 from Pennsylvania 
and $1,200 from the federal government. The Seneca Nation separately settled 
land claims against Pennsylvania in February 1791 for the sum of $800.[7] 
The General Assembly of Pennsylvania commissioned the surveying of land 
near Presque Isle through an act passed on April 18, 1795. Andrew Ellicott, 
who completed Pierre Charles L'Enfant's survey of Washington, D.C. and 
helped resolve the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York, arrived 
to begin the survey and lay out the plan for the city in June 1795. Initial 
settlement of the area began that year.[7][8] Lt. Colonel Seth Reed and 
his family moved to the Erie area from Geneva, New York; they were Yankees 
from Uxbridge, Massachusetts. They became the first European-American settlers 
of Erie, settling at what became known as "Presque Isle". President James 
Madison began the construction of a naval fleet during the War of 1812 
to gain control of the Great Lakes from the British. Daniel Dobbins of 
Erie and Noah Brown of Boston were notable shipbuilders who led construction 
of four schooner−rigged gunboats and two brigs. Commodore Oliver Hazard 
Perry arrived from Rhode Island and led the squadron to success in the 
historic Battle of Lake Erie.[9] Erie was an important shipbuilding, fishing, 
and railroad hub during the mid-19th century. The city was the site where 
three sets of track gauges met. While the delays required cargo troubles 
for commerce and travel, they provided much needed local jobs in Erie. 
When a national standardized gauge was proposed, those jobs, and the importance 
of the rail hub itself, were put in jeopardy. In an event known as the 
Erie Gauge War, the citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, 
ripped up track and rioted to try to stop the standardization.[10] On August 
3, 1915, the Mill Creek (Lake Erie) flooded downtown Erie. A culvert, or 
a tunnel, was blocked by debris, and collapsed.[11] A four-block reservoir, 
caused by torrential downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting deluge 
destroyed 225 houses and killed 36 people.[11] After the flood, Mayor Miles 
Brown Kitts had the Mill Creek directed into another larger culvert, constructed 
for more than 2 miles under the city, before emptying into Presque Isle 
Bay on the city's lower east side. Downtown Erie continued to grow for 
most of the 20th century, based on its manufacturing base. It attracted 
numerous waves of European immigrants for industrial jobs. Erie's economy 
began to suffer in the later part of the 20th century as industrial restructuring 
took place and jobs moved out of the area; it was considered part of the 
Rust Belt. The importance of American manufacturing, US steel and coal 
production, and commercial fishing began to gradually decline.[12] before 
taking a major population downturn in the 1970s.[12] With the advent of 
the automobile age after World War II and government subsidies for highway 
construction, thousands of residents left Erie for suburbs such as Millcreek 
Township, which now has over 50,000 people.[12] This caused a decline in 
retail businesses, some of which followed to the suburbs. Erie won the 
All-America City Award in 1972, and was a finalist in 1961, 1994, 1995 
and 2009.[13][14] Erie is situated in northwestern Pennsylvania at 42°6′52″N 
80°4′34″W﻿ / ﻿42.11444°N 80.07611°W﻿ / 42.11444; -80.07611 (42.114507, 
-80.076213),[15] on the southern shore of Lake Erie across from the Canadian 
province of Ontario. It is 100 miles (160 km) northeast of Cleveland, Ohio, 
90 miles (140 km) southwest of Buffalo, New York, and 128 miles (206 km) 
north of Pittsburgh. Erie's bedrock is Devonian shale and siltstone, overlain 
by glacial tills and stratified drift. Stream drainage in the city flows 
northward into Lake Erie, then through Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence 
River, and out to the Atlantic Ocean. South of Erie is a drainage divide, 
beyond which most of the streams in western Pennsylvania flow south into 
the Allegheny or Ohio rivers.[16] According to the United States Census 
Bureau, the city has a total area of 19.3 square miles (49.9 km2), with 
19.1 square miles (49.4 km2) being land and the remaining 0.2 square miles 
(0.5 km2), or 1.03%, being water.[2] Presque Isle State Park (known to 
the locals as "The Peninsula"), juts into Lake Erie just north of the city 
limits and has 7 miles (11 km) of public beaches, wetlands, and fishing 
sites. Erie is laid out in a grid surrounding Perry Square in the downtown 
area.[17] The downtown buildings are separated from the waterfront by the 
Bayfront Parkway.[17] The tallest structure in Erie is St. Peter Cathedral 
at 265 feet (81 m), and the tallest building is Renaissance Centre at 198 
feet (60 m). Erie has generally small ethnic neighborhoods including a 
Little Italy. South of 38th Street, the grid gives way to curvilinear roads 
of post-1970 suburban development. Millcreek Township and upper Peach Street 
in Summit Township include the Erie metropolitan area's newer developments. 
Most of the cityscape includes renovated and refurbished factory buildings, 
mid−rise housing, single family homes, and office buildings. Erie's waterfront 
includes the Burger King Amphitheater and surrounding parkland, which hosts 
numerous festivals. The Bayfront Convention Center is on Sassafras Pier 
next to Dobbins Landing. The Bicentennial Tower is centrally located in 
the skyline when viewed from Presque Isle State Park, with the high-rise 
and mid-rise buildings flanking the higher ground behind and to the east 
and west sides. On the east end of the waterfront, the Erie Maritime Museum 
and the city's main library, and third largest in Pennsylvania, host the 
USS Niagara. Docks and marinas fill the freshwater shoreline in between. 
The climate of Erie is typical of the Great Lakes. Erie is located in the 
snow belt that stretches from Cleveland to Syracuse and Watertown; accordingly, 
its winters are typically cold, with heavy lake effect snow, but also with 
occasional stretches of mild weather that cause accumulated snow to melt. 
Erie lies on the typical humid continental zone (Köppen Dfa).[18] The city 
experiences a full range of weather events, including snow, ice, rain, 
thunderstorms and fog. The city's lakeside location helps to temper summer 
heat, with an average of only 3.8 days of 90 °F (32 °C)+ highs annually, 
and the highest temperature ever recorded was 100 °F (38 °C) on June 25, 
1988; there is an average of 2.5 days with lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or colder 
annually, and the lowest temperature ever recorded was −18 °F (−28 °C) 
on January 19, 1994 and February 16, 2015.[19] Erie is 6th on The Daily 
Beast list of snowiest places in the United States, averaging 78.7 inches 
(200 cm);[20] however, the 1981–2010 normal seasonal snowfall is 100.8 in 
(256 cm). The adverse winter conditions caused USAir Flight 499 to overrun 
the runway at Erie International Airport in 1986, as well as causing whiteouts 
that were responsible for a 50 car pile-up on Interstate 90.[21][22] Erie 
was determined to be the snowiest city in the US in the 2013-2014 snow 
season. Erie received 138.4 inches of snow that season. According to the 
National Weather service, Erie was just ahead of Syracuse, NY by 6 inches 
of snow.[23] As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 101,786 people, 
40,913 households, and 22,915 families residing in the city.[26] There 
were 44,790 housing units at an average vacancy rate of 8 percent. Erie 
has long been declining in population due to the departure of factories 
and dependent businesses.[27] The city has lost approximately 40,000 people 
since the early 1960s, allowing Allentown to claim the position as Pennsylvania's 
third-largest city behind Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Erie's population 
was spread evenly among all age groups, with the median being 34. About 
13% of families and 19% of the population were below the poverty line. 
Most of the people who reside in Erie are of European descent.[31] Since 
the mid-1990s, the International Institute of Erie (IIE), founded in 1919, 
has helped with the resettlement of refugees from Bosnia, Eritrea, Ghana, 
Iraq, Kosovo, Liberia, Nepal, Somalia, Sudan, the former Soviet Union, 
and Vietnam. The inclusion of refugees in Erie's community augments religious 
diversity and prompts community events such as cultural festivals.[32] 
In the early 20th century, Erie had a significant Russian immigrant community, 
many of whom worked in the shipbuilding plants along the bayfront. Unusual 
for a Great Lakes city, a substantial number of these Russian immigrants 
were priestless (Bespopovtsy) Old Believers. In 1983, most of this community 
united with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia and became an Old 
Ritualist priest within the canonical Orthodox Church.[33] Even today, 
the gold-domed Church of the Nativity,[34] on the bayfront near the former 
heart of the Russian community, is an Old Ritualist church and home parish 
to the famed iconographer Fr. Theodore Jurewicz.[35] Erie has a Jewish 
community that is over 150 years old. Temple Anshe Hesed, a member of the 
Union for Reform Judaism, is served by its spiritual leader, Rabbi John 
L. Bush.[36] Congregation Brith Sholom (The Jewish Center) is affiliated 
with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, and Rabbi Leonard Lifshen 
has been its spiritual leader since 1989. Erie is home to the Roman Catholic 
Diocese of Erie, covering 13 counties—at 9,936 square miles (25,734 km2), 
it is the largest in the state. Its diocesan seat is the Saint Peter Cathedral 
in Erie, which has a 265 feet (81 m) central tower flanked by two 150 feet 
(46 m) towers. Lawrence Thomas Persico is Bishop of Erie, since October 
1, 2012; Donald Trautman is Bishop Emeritus of the diocese.[37] According 
to the Association of Religion Date Archives,[38] Erie County had a total 
population of 280,843 people in 2000, of which 103,333 claimed affiliation 
with the Catholic Church, 40,301 with mainline Protestant houses of worship, 
and 12,980 with evangelical Protestant churches. Erie is the Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania's primary access point to Lake Erie, the Great Lakes, and 
the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The city emerged as a maritime center after 
the American Revolution, then as a railroad hub during the great American 
westward expansion. Erie became an important city for iron and steel manufacturing 
during the Industrial Revolution and thrived well into the 20th century 
with big industry. While only General Electric diesel-electric locomotive 
building remains from the ranks of the large manufacturers in the early 
21st century, a more diverse mix of mid-sized industries has emerged. This 
broader economic base includes not only smaller and more agile steel and 
plastic plants, but also a vigorous service sector: health, insurance and 
tourism. As of December 2010[update], Erie's unemployment rate was 8.9 percent, 
as compared to rates for Pennsylvania and the United States at 8.5 and 
9.4 percent, respectively.[39] Erie is the corporate headquarters of the 
Erie Insurance Group, and Marquette Savings Bank. Lord Corporation was 
founded and has major operations in Erie.[40] Along with GE and Erie Insurance, 
major employers in the county include the county, state and federal governments, 
as well as the Erie City School District.[41] Over 10 percent of the USA's 
plastics are manufactured or finished in Erie-based plastics plants.[5] 
Erie is an emerging center for biofuels and environmental research, producing 
over 45 million U.S. gallons of biofuel a year.[42] Tourism plays an increasingly 
important role in the local economy with over 4 million people visiting 
Presque Isle State Park and other attractions. Shoppers from Ohio, New 
York, and the Canadian province of Ontario frequent the Millcreek Mall 
and Peach Street stores and attractions as a result of Pennsylvania's tax 
exemption on clothing. Both UPMC Hamot and Saint Vincent Health System 
are also major employers in Erie.[41] Although both of these hospitals 
had been stand-alone Erie entities, Hamot merged with the University of 
Pittsburgh Medical Center in 2011[43] and St. Vincent, which affiliated 
with the Cleveland Clinic in 2012,[44] merged with Highmark's Allegheny 
Health Network in 2013.[45] The United States Department of Veterans Affairs 
operates the Erie Veterans Affairs Medical Center on East 38th Street. 
The Shriners International operates Shriners Hospital for Children in Erie 
since 1927.[46] The Erie Water Works, which was incorporated in 1865 as 
the Erie Water and Gas Company, includes a reservoir, two water treatment 
plants, and an elaborate water works and pipe network that provides water 
for most of the city and suburbs. Penelec, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy, 
supplies electricity to the region, as well as the Northwestern Pennsylvania 
Rural Electric Cooperative. Time Warner Cable became the region's cable 
television provider, after taking over Adelphia, and also provides digital 
phone and high-speed internet to the region. Local telephone and high speed 
internet service is also provided by Verizon. Sewage service in Erie is 
provided by the Erie Sewer Authority, and many outlying townships have 
partnerships with the Sewer Authority for service. The Authority cleans 
about 30−40 million US gallons (150,000 m3) of wastewater every day.[47] 
The time and temperature number in Erie is 452-6311 and was originally 
discontinued by Verizon in October 2008 before being restarted by a private 
individual two years later.[48] The city of Erie and northwest Pennsylvania 
is located in area code 814. On December 16, 2010, the Pennsylvania Public 
Utility Commission (PUC) voted to split the area code, which was to take 
effect February 1, 2012.[49] The North American Numbering Plan decided 
that northwest Pennsylvania would receive the new code of 582. A local 
grassroots coalition began organizing an opposition to the plan, and generated 
numerous petitions for reconsideration. The PUC immediately voted to review 
their decision and ordered additional public input hearings and technical 
conferences as a response to the strong public outcry.[50] In January 2011, 
the PUC announced that it was placing the entire area code split plan on 
hold as NEUSTAR pushed the projected exhaustion date back two years to 
2015.[51] Erie is home to several professional and amateur performing-arts 
groups. The most significant is the Erie Philharmonic, in continuous existence 
since 1913 (with the exception of an interregnum during World War II). 
This group of professional musicians also has a full chorus and a Junior 
Philharmonic division that tours the area. The Lake Erie Ballet is a professional 
company that performs well-known programs throughout the year.[52] The 
Erie Civic Music Association attracts, sponsors, and books performances 
by professional musicians, singers, entertainers, and ensembles from around 
the world.[53] The Erie Art Museum is the city's main art gallery, located 
in the Old Customshouse on State Street. Its collection has an emphasis 
on folk art and modern art and it hosts a popular blues and jazz concert 
series. The Erie Art Museum also works on public art projects in an effort 
to revitalize and improve the city. In 2000, the Erie Art Museum created 
a project entitled GoFish, similar to CowParade. 95 fiberglass fish were 
decorated by Erie artists and placed throughout the city. Patrons paid 
$3,000 for a fish and the proceeds went to Gannon University's Scholarship 
Fund and the Erie Public Art Endowment Fund.[54] The Erie Art Museum created 
a similar public art project in 2004 that involved frogs rather than fish.[55] 
In 2012, the Erie Art Museum began a project to create forty artistic and 
functional bike racks, designed and created by local artists.[56] The museum's 
intentions are to add color and interest to downtown Erie and to promote 
bicycling, encouraging healthy lifestyles and environmental awareness.[57] 
Downtown Erie's historic and ornate Warner Theatre hosts a range of performances. 
Renovated in the 1980s and again in 2007,[58] the Warner is the hub of 
Erie's Civic Center. The downtown area is the home of the Erie Playhouse, 
one of the leading community theaters in the country, and the third oldest 
community theater in the U.S. .[59] Since 2007, the annual Roar on the 
Shore motorcycle rally has taken place in Erie. Along West 6th Street is 
Millionaires Row, a collection of 19th century Victorian mansions. The 
John Hill House is one of the notable residences. The Erie Land Light stands 
at the foot of Lighthouse Street.[60] The lighthouse was built in 1818 
and replaced in 1867. The Bicentennial Tower, on Dobbins Landing at the 
foot of State Street, was built in 1995−96 to celebrate the city's bicentennial. 
It is 187 feet (57 m) tall and gives a panoramic view of Lake Erie and 
downtown. The Blasco Library and Erie Maritime Museum are its neighbors 
to the east. Presque Isle Downs opened on February 28, 2007, and was the 
fourth slots parlor in the state and the first in Western Pennsylvania.[61] 
Table games opened at the casino on July 8, 2010.[62] Erie has also been 
the location for many movies, including the hometown for fictional band 
"The Wonders" in That Thing You Do! featuring Tom Hanks. It is also mentioned 
in the film Wall Street as the location of the fictional company Anacott 
Steel. Erie is the hometown of Train lead singer, Patrick Monahan. Erie 
is also the hometown of Marc Brown, the author and illustrator of Arthur 
books and TV series. Erie is served by Erie Times-News, the city's only 
daily newspaper. The Nielsen Company ranks Erie as 144 out of the 210 largest 
television market in the United States, as of the 2010−2011 report.[63] 
The market is served by stations affiliated with major American networks 
including WICU-TV (NBC), WJET-TV (ABC), WFXP (FOX), WSEE-TV (CBS), and 
WSEE-DT2 (CW). WQLN is a member of Public Broadcasting Service and also 
broadcasts in London, Ontario. Cable companies available for Erie include 
Time Warner Cable, DirecTV, and Dish Network. Erie is also served by several 
AM and FM radio stations based in the city, and dozens of other stations 
are received from elsewhere. Erie plays host to a number of semi-pro and 
professional sports teams. The Erie SeaWolves play AA baseball in the Eastern 
League as an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. The Erie Otters play hockey 
in the Ontario Hockey League. The Erie BayHawks are a member of the NBA 
Development League. The Erie Illusion is a member of the United States 
Women's Football League. Hockey and basketball games are played at Erie 
Insurance Arena, while Minor League Baseball games are held at UPMC Park. 
Gannon University, Mercyhurst University, Edinboro University, and Penn 
State Behrend have active NCAA collegiate sports programs. The local high 
schools compete in PIAA District 10 sporting events. Additionally, Cathedral 
Preparatory School hosts the annual high school basketball tournament featuring 
top national teams; called the Burger King Classic since 2010. Scholastic 
and intramural sports are held at school and park facilities around the 
city. The Mercyhurst Ice Center, the JMC Ice Arena, Family First Sports 
Park, and Erie Veterans Memorial Stadium are many sports arenas and stadiums 
available in and around the city. The Lake Erie Speedway, a 3⁄8-mile (0.6 km) 
NASCAR sanctioned race track is located in Greenfield Township. Horse racing 
is found at the Presque Isle Downs and Casino located near Summit Township. 
Erie's location along the shores of Lake Erie provides a plethora of outdoor 
activities throughout the year. The region's largest attraction is Presque 
Isle State Park, drawing over four million visitors a year.[64] The region 
grows grapes and produces the third largest amount of wine in the United 
States.[4] Downtown Erie is surrounded by Presque Isle State Park, a National 
Natural Landmark.[64] The Seaway Trail runs through downtown Erie along 
the lakefront. The Tom Ridge Environmental Center, at the foot of Presque 
Isle, features 7,000 square feet (650 m2) of exhibit space.[65] Other tourist 
destinations include the Bayfront Convention Center; the Bicentennial Tower 
that overlooks Lake Erie; Dobbins Landing, a pier in downtown Erie; the 
Erie Land Light, and the Erie Maritime Museum, the home port of the Niagara. 
The 2,600,000-square-foot (240,000 m2) Millcreek Mall, one of the largest 
shopping malls in the United States, is located on Peach Street in nearby 
Millcreek Township.[66] The indoor waterpark Splash Lagoon, in Summit Township, 
is the largest indoor waterpark on the East Coast and third largest in 
the United States.[59] Waldameer Park, located at the base of Presque Isle, 
is the fourth oldest amusement park in Pennsylvania, and the tenth oldest 
in the United States.[67] The city of Erie is incorporated as a 3rd class 
city under Pennsylvania law.[68] Incorporated under an "optional charter", 
the city is governed by a mayor–council government. The government consists 
of a mayor, treasurer, controller and a seven-member city council. All 
of whom are elected to four-year terms, with the terms of the council designed 
to be overlapping.[68] The mayor is chief executive; the city council prepares 
legislation and conducts oversight. The city council meets in Mario S. 
Bagnoni Council Chambers at City Hall. Joseph E. Sinnott (D) is the mayor 
of the city of Erie and was first elected in 2005. As of July 2016[update], 
the Erie City Council consists of:[69] In exchange for tax revenue, the 
city of Erie provides its residents with police and fire protection. For 
separate quarterly payments, the city provides garbage, recycling, water 
and sewer services. The Erie Police Department provides law enforcement 
in the city and currently has a complement of 173 sworn personnel under 
the direct supervision of Chief of Police Randy Bowers. The City of Erie 
Fire Department is a full-time career fire department and employs around 
150 uniformed personnel. These employees are under the direct supervision 
of Chief Tony Pol. The city currently operates out of six fire houses and 
protects approximately 20 square miles (52 km2). The city has six engines, 
two towers and one water rescue unit. The city provides mutual aid to fire 
departments of Millcreek Township, Summit Township and East County. Erie 
is the largest city in Pennsylvania's 3rd congressional district and is 
currently represented in Congress by Republican Mike Kelly, who was elected 
in 2010. Republican Jane M. Earll of the 49th District has represented 
Erie in the Pennsylvania State Senate since 1997. Senator Earll declined 
to run for a fifth term in 2012 and was succeeded by Democrat Sean D. Wiley. 
The city of Erie is split by the 1st and 2nd Districts of the Pennsylvania 
House of Representatives and is represented by Democrats Patrick Harkins 
and Florindo Fabrizio, respectively.[70] Erie Public Schools enroll 12,527 students 
in primary and secondary grades.[71] The district has 23 public schools 
including elementary, middle, high, and one charter school. Other than 
public schools, the city is home to more than 40 private schools and academies. 
The City of Erie is served by four public high schools, Central Tech High

colleges and universities. Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM), 
a large medical school, with branch campuses in Bradenton, Florida and 
Greensburg, Pennsylvania, has the largest enrollments of medical students 
in the country, with over 3,000.[72] Penn State-Erie, The Behrend College 
offers more than 40 degrees at the associate, bachelor's and master's levels. 
It has an enrollment of 4400, with housing for 1800 on campus.[73] Other 
notable colleges in the Erie area include Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, 
Gannon University, a Catholic university, situated in downtown Erie. Another 
Catholic institution, Mercyhurst University, is in the southeast part of 
the city. Ranking Erie city and county officials, as well as officials 
of the Erie School District, began looking into the need for a community 
college in the Erie area in 2006.[74] As of January 2008[update], county 
officials and representatives of Penn State-Behrend, Mercyhurst and Gannon 
were in serious discussions expected to lead to the creation of Northwest 
Pennsylvania Community College by September 2009. Besides accreditation 
issues, officials must resolve whether to use local four-year educational 
institutions or to build a separate site in Summit Township for community 
college classes.[75] Erie is also home of the Barber National Institute 
and its Elizabeth Lee Black School, which provides services and education 
for children and adults with mental disabilities. Erie is home to its main 
campus, and it provides services in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.[76] The 
Achievement Center also serves the needs of children from birth to age 
21 with physical and mental health disabilities. The public libraries in 
Erie are part of the Erie County library system. The Raymond M. Blasco, 
M. D. Memorial Library, named for its benefactor, opened in 1996.[77] It 
is the third largest library in Pennsylvania.[78] It is connected to the 
Erie Maritime Museum, both of which are part of a bayfront improvement 
project that includes the Bayfront Convention Center and the Bicentennial 
Tower on Dobbins Landing. Erie is well connected to the Interstate Highway 
System. There are six "Erie exits" along Interstate 90, a major cross-country 
thoroughfare running from Boston to Seattle. Erie is the northern terminus 
of Interstate 79, which travels south to Pittsburgh and, ultimately, West 
Virginia. The western terminus for Interstate 86, also called the "Southern 
Tier Expressway," is at Interstate 90 between Erie and North East, Pennsylvania. 
Interstate 86 continues east through New York to Binghamton. The Bayfront 
Connector runs from Interstate 90 in Harborcreek to the Bayfront Parkway 
and downtown Erie, along the east side of the city, then connects to Interstate 
79 on the west side of the city. Major thoroughfares in the city include 
12th Street, 26th Street, 38th Street and Peach Street. Peach is also a 
part of U.S. Route 19, whose northern terminus is in Erie and continues 
south eventually reaching the Gulf of Mexico. Other major routes running 
through Erie are Pennsylvania Route 5, known as the Seaway Trail and is 
made up of parts of 6th Street, 8th Street, 12th Street, and East Lake 
Road in the city, U.S. Route 20, which is 26th Street in the city. The 
city is divided between east and west by State Street. The Erie Metropolitan 
Transit Authority (EMTA) operates the city's transit bus system, known 
as the 'e'. Buses run seven days a week in the city, with trips out to 
other parts of the county occurring a couple times a week. Intercity buses 
providing transportation between Buffalo, Cleveland and Pittsburgh are 
operated by Greyhound Lines. Service between Buffalo and Cleveland is also 
provided by Lakefront Lines. Both companies operate out of the Intermodal 
Transportation Center, which opened in 2002 at the foot of Holland Street. 
The former "Water Level Route" of the New York Central Railroad travels 
directly through Erie. It is now the mainline for CSX freight trains. The 
mainline of the Norfolk Southern Railway, originally built by the Nickel 
Plate Railroad, also travels through Erie. At one time Norfolk Southern 
trains ran down the middle of 19th Street, but were removed in 2002.[79] 
Passenger rail service is provided by Amtrak's Lake Shore Limited out of 
Union Station at 14th and State Streets. The Lake Shore Limited stops twice 
daily—one eastbound towards New York City, and one westbound towards Chicago. 
Erie International Airport / Tom Ridge Field (IATA code: ERI; IACO code: 
KERI) is located 5 miles (8.0 km) west of the city and hosts general aviation, 
charter, and airline service. Destinations with non-stop flights out of 
Erie include Chicago O'Hare International Airport via United Airlines, 
Philadelphia International Airport via US Airways and Detroit Metropolitan 
Wayne County Airport via Delta Air Lines. Erie International is in the 
midst of a $80.5 million runway extension. The extension is slated to increase 
the runway's length by 1,920 feet (590 m), for a total runway length of 
8,420 feet (2,600 m), "to meet safety requirements" as well as allowing 
the airport to accommodate larger aircraft.[80] The Port of Erie is located 
on Presque Isle Bay, a natural harbor formed by Presque Isle. It offers 
some of the finest port facilities for cargo shipping on the Great Lakes, 
with direct rail access. The Erie−Western Pennsylvania Port Authority provides 
water taxi service in the summer months between Dobbins Landing and Liberty 
Park in downtown Erie, and the Waterworks ferry landing on Presque Isle.[81]
