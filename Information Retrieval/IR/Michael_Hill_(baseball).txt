Michael L. Hill (born March 25, 1971) is the president of baseball operations 
for the Miami Marlins baseball club. Hill served as the General Manager 
from 2007 to 2013.[1] Born to a Cuban mother, Hill is the only Cuban-American 
president of baseball operations in Major League Baseball. He went to Harvard 
University and was drafted in 1993 by the Texas Rangers in the 31st round. 
He made his Minor League debut in 1993 with Class A Short-Season Erie and 
remained with the club when it relocated to Hudson Valley in 1994. He played 
two seasons (1993–94) in the Rangers system and one year (1995) in the 
Reds organization before joining the Tampa Bay Devil Rays front office 
in 1995. Hill has 14 seasons experience in various front office capacities 
following his retirement from minor league baseball. He commenced his front 
office career spending five seasons (1995–1999) as an assistant in the 
Tampa Bay Devil Rays' scouting and player development departments. In 1999, 
Baseball America named Hill as one of 10 people in baseball whose prominence 
will increase significantly in the first decade of the new century. It 
quoted strong sources who said he would turn into a successful general 
manager before the 2010 season. That year, he began working for the Colorado 
Rockies, serving as their Director of Player Development until leaving 
to join the Florida (now Miami) Marlins' front office. Hill has been a 
part of the Marlins organization for over a decade, having joined their 
front office in 2002. At the age of 32, Hill was named to the "Hot List" 
by the Black Enterprise magazine in their December 2003 issue, a list that 
represents the best and brightest African American executives under the 
age of 40. Over time, Hill has served positions such as VP, Assistant General 
Manager, and General Manager. Hill worked closely in the past with former 
President of Baseball Operations Larry Beinfest, focusing on roster management, 
payroll and contract research and negotiation, and waiver and rule compliance. 
Hill signed an extension through the 2015 season on September 29, 2007, 
and was promoted to president of baseball operations of the Miami Marlins 
in September 2013.[2] Hill was born to an African-American father and a 
Cuban mother. As a proud Cuban-American, Hill is even fluent in Spanish 
and speaks to media in Spanish. He is the only Cuban-American President 
of Baseball Operations in Major League Baseball. A 1993 graduate of Harvard 
University, Hill was elected senior class marshal (the equivalent of class 
president) while starring as the Crimson football team's top rusher and 
the baseball team's captain. Hill was born and raised in Cincinnati, where 
he played football, baseball and basketball at the city's Country Day School.
