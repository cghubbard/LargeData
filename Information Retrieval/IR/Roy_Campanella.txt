Roy Campanella (November 19, 1921 – June 26, 1993), nicknamed "Campy", 
was an American baseball player, primarily as a catcher. The Philadelphia 
native played for the Negro leagues and Mexican League for several seasons 
before entering the minor leagues in 1946. He made his Major League Baseball 
(MLB) debut in 1948. His playing career ended in 1958 when he was paralyzed 
by an automobile accident.[1] Widely considered to be one of the greatest 
catchers in the history of the game,[2] Campanella played for the Brooklyn 
Dodgers in the 1940s and 1950s. After he retired as a player, Campanella 
held positions in scouting and community relations with the Dodgers. He 
was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969. Campanella's father 
John was the son of Sicilian immigrants. His mother Ida was African American. 
Therefore, he was effectively prohibited from MLB play before 1947, the 
season that black players were admitted to the major leagues for the first 
time since the 19th century. Campanella began playing Negro league baseball 
for the Washington Elite Giants in 1937 after dropping out of school on 
his sixteenth birthday. The Elite Giants moved to Baltimore the following 
year,[3] and Campanella became a star player with the team. In 1942 and 
1943, Campanella played in the Mexican League with the Monterrey Sultans. 
Lázaro Salazar, the team's manager, told Campanella that one day he would 
play at the major league level. Campanella moved into the Brooklyn Dodgers' 
minor league system in 1946 as the Dodger organization began preparations 
to break the MLB color barrier with Jackie Robinson. For the 1946 season, 
Robinson was assigned to the Montreal Royals, the Dodgers' affiliate in 
the Class AAA International League. Meanwhile, the team looked to assign 
Campanella to a Class B league. After the general manager of the Danville 
Dodgers of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League reported that he did not feel 
the league was ready for racial integration, the organization sent Campanella 
and pitcher Don Newcombe to the Nashua Dodgers of the Class B New England 
League, where the Dodgers felt the climate would be more tolerant. The 
Nashua team thus became the first professional baseball team of the 20th 
century to field a racially integrated lineup in the United States. Campanella's 
1946 season proceeded largely without racist incidents, and in one game 
Campanella assumed the managerial duties after manager Walter Alston was 
ejected. This made Campanella the first African-American to manage Caucasian 
players of an organized professional baseball team. Nashua was three runs 
down at the time Campanella took over. They came back to win, in part due 
to Campanella's decision to use Newcombe as a pinch hitter during the seventh 
inning; Newcombe hit a game-tying two-run home run. Jackie Robinson's first 
season in the major leagues came in 1947, and Campanella began his MLB 
career with the Brooklyn Dodgers the following season, playing his first 
game on April 20, 1948. He played for the Dodgers from 1948 through 1957 
as their regular catcher. In 1948, he had three different uniform numbers 
(33, 39, and 56) before settling on 39 for the rest of his career. Campanella 
played in the All-Star Game every year from 1949 through 1956. His 1949 
All-Star selection made him one of the first four African-Americans so 
honored. (Jackie Robinson, Don Newcombe and Larry Doby were also All-Stars 
in 1949.)[4] He hit home runs in five straight games in 1950; the only 
other Dodgers to homer in five consecutive games are Shawn Green (2001), 
Matt Kemp (2010), Adrian Gonzalez (2014–15), and Joc Pederson (2015).[5] 
Campanella received the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in the National 
League three times: in 1951, 1953, and 1955. In each of his MVP seasons, 
he batted more than .300, hit more than 30 home runs and had more than 
100 runs batted in. His 142 RBI during 1953 exceeded the franchise record 
of 130, which had been held by Jack Fournier (1925) and Babe Herman (1930). 
Today it is the second most in franchise history, Tommy Davis breaking 
it with 153 RBI in 1962. That same year, Campanella hit 40 home runs in 
games in which he appeared as a catcher, a record that lasted until 1996, 
when it was exceeded by Todd Hundley. During his career, he threw out 57% 
of the base runners who tried to steal a base on him, the highest by any 
catcher in major league history.[6] In 1955 (Campanella's final MVP season), 
he helped Brooklyn win its first-ever World Series championship. After 
the Dodgers lost the first two games of the series to the Yankees, Campanella 
began Brooklyn's comeback by hitting a two-out, two-run home run in the 
first inning of Game 3. The Dodgers won that game, got another home run 
from Campanella in a Game 4 victory that tied the series, then went on 
to claim the series in seven games when Johnny Podres shutout the Yankees 
2-0 in Game 7. Campanella caught three no-hitters during his career: Carl 
Erskine's two on June 19, 1952 [7] and May 12, 1956 [8] and Sal Maglie's 
on September 25, 1956.[9] After the 1957 season, the Brooklyn Dodgers relocated 
to Los Angeles and became the Los Angeles Dodgers, but Campanella's playing 
career came to an end as a result of the automobile accident. He never 
played a game for Los Angeles. Campanella lived in Glen Cove, New York, 
on the North Shore of Long Island; he operated a liquor store in Harlem 
between regular-season games and during the off-season. After closing the 
store for the night on January 28, 1958, he began his drive home to Glen 
Cove. While he was traveling at about 30 mph (48 km/h), his rented 1957 
Chevrolet sedan hit a patch of ice at an S-curve on Dosoris Lane near Apple 
Tree Lane in Glen Cove, skidded into a telephone pole, and overturned, 
breaking Campanella's neck. He fractured the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae 
and compressed the spinal cord.[10][11] The accident left Campanella paralyzed 
from the shoulders down.[10] With physical therapy, he was eventually able 
to regain substantial use of his arms and hands.[12] He was able to feed 
himself, shake hands, and gesture while speaking, but he required a wheelchair 
for mobility for the remainder of his life.[13] After his playing career, 
Campanella remained involved with the Dodgers. In January 1959 the Dodgers 
named him assistant supervisor of scouting for the eastern part of the 
United States and special coach at the team's annual spring training camp 
in Vero Beach, Florida, serving each year as a mentor and coach to young 
catchers in the Dodger organization.[14] In 1978, he moved to California 
and accepted a job as assistant to the Dodgers' director of community relations, 
Campanella's former teammate and longtime friend Don Newcombe. On May 7, 
1959, the Dodgers, then playing their second season in Los Angeles, honored 
Campanella with Roy Campanella Night at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
The New York Yankees agreed to make a special visit to Los Angeles to play 
an exhibition game against the Dodgers for the occasion. The Yankees won 
the game, 6–2. The attendance at the game was 93,103, setting a record 
at that time for the largest crowd to attend a Major League Baseball game. 
The proceeds from the game went to defray Campanella's medical bills. During 
1969, Campanella was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, the second 
player of African American heritage so honored, after Jackie Robinson. 
The same year, he received the Bronze Medallion from the City of New York. 
Campanella was elected to the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall Of Fame 
in 1971.[15] On June 4, 1972, the Dodgers retired Campanella's uniform 
number 39 alongside Jackie Robinson's number 42 and Sandy Koufax's number 
32. In an article in Esquire magazine during 1976, sportswriter Harry Stein 
published an article called the "All Time All-Star Argument Starter", a 
list of five ethnic baseball teams. Campanella was the catcher on Stein's 
black team. Campanella was interviewed by Edward R. Murrow on the CBS program 
Person to Person on October 2, 1953 and again on January 2, 1959. Campanella 
also appeared as Mystery Guest on What's My Line? episode 171 on September 
6, 1953 and as a guest celebrity on The Name's the Same (ABC-TV) on July 
27, 1954. Campanella was also mentioned in the lyrics of the song "Did 
You See Jackie Robinson Hit that Ball?", written and recorded by Buddy 
Johnson in 1949 (and covered by Count Basie and his Orchestra that same 
year) and in the lyrics to the song "We Didn't Start the Fire" by Billy 
Joel. Campanella was also honored on the famous Ralph Edwards show This 
Is Your Life. Campanella appeared as himself in the Lassie episode "The 
Mascot", first broadcast September 27, 1959, in a story where he is coaching 
Timmy Martin's "Boys' League" team. Roy Campanella's father was Italian 
and his mother was African American.(Jackie & Campy by William C. Kashatus, 
pp. 44) Roy was one of five children born to the couple. He was raised 
in a section of Philadelphia that generally had better race relations than 
much of the city. His easy going personality and strong work ethic were 
credited for his being able to move successfully between the races. Although 
Branch Rickey considered hiring Campanella to break baseball's color barrier, 
Rickey ultimately decided upon Jackie Robinson. Robinson and his wife stayed 
with the Campanella family during some ballgames because adequate hotels 
for blacks could not be found in the city.(Jackie & Campy by William C 
Kashatus, pp, 65-68 &75) Campanella was married three times. His first 
marriage, to Bernice Ray on January 3, 1939, ended in divorce. They had 
two daughters together. On April 30, 1945, he married Ruthe Willis and 
had three children with her (including a son, television director Roy Campanella 
II). Their marriage deteriorated after his accident and was never the same; 
they separated in 1960 and Ruthe died during January 1963. Campanella's 
adopted son David had a somewhat troubled life; he was arrested a number 
of times, developed a problem with drugs and died at the age of 41. On 
May 5, 1964, Campanella married Roxie Doles, who survived him. Campanella 
died of heart failure on June 26, 1993, at his home in Woodland Hills, 
California.[1][16] He was cremated at the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills 
Cemetery in Los Angeles.[17] In 1999, Campanella ranked number 50 on The 
Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee 
for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. The book Carl Erskine's 
Tales from the Dodgers Dugout: Extra Innings (2004) includes short stories 
from former Dodger pitcher Carl Erskine. Campanella is prominent in many 
of these stories. Campanella himself authored the inspirational book It's 
Good to Be Alive, published during 1959, which details his journey back 
from the near-fatal car accident that left him paralyzed. The book mentions 
the years of efforts by physical therapist Sam Brockington which allowed 
Campanella to regain some use of his arms, eventually overcome his initial 
bitterness about his fate, and finally adopt an optimistic outlook on life. 
Michael Landon made his TV-movie directorial debut in the 1974 movie It's 
Good to Be Alive, in which Campanella was portrayed by Paul Winfield. Campanella 
was featured on a United States postage stamp in 2006.[19] The stamp is 
one of a block of four honoring baseball sluggers, the others being Mickey 
Mantle, Hank Greenberg, and Mel Ott. The Los Angeles Dodgers announced 
the creation of the Roy Campanella Award in September 2006. The award is 
voted on among the club's players and coaches and is given to the Dodger 
who best exemplifies "Campy's" spirit and leadership. Shortstop Rafael 
Furcal was named the inaugural winner of the award. Simon & Schuster published 
a biography of Campanella in 2011 written by Neil Lanctot, author of Negro 
League Baseball – The Rise and Ruin of a Black Institution. The book is 
entitled Campy – The Two Lives of Roy Campanella.[20] The book reveals 
new details about Campanella's near-fatal car accident and his stormy relationship 
with Jackie Robinson. It also provides the most comprehensive look at Campanella's 
Negro league career, including newly compiled year-by-year statistics. 
SpiritClips.com, a sub-division of Hallmark Channel, released 'Roy Campanella 
Night', a 2013 short film documenting the period of paralysis leading up 
to the famous tribute to Roy Campanella on May 7, 1959 at Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum. The movie was directed by Chris Commons and stars Anthony Holiday,
