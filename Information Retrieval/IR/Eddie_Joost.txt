As player As manager Edwin David Joost (June 5, 1916 – April 12, 2011) 
was an American professional baseball player and manager. He played as 
a shortstop in Major League Baseball from 1936 to 1955. In 1954, Joost 
became the third and last manager in the 54-year history of the Philadelphia 
Athletics. Under Joost, the A's finished last in the American League and 
lost over 100 games. After that season, they relocated to Kansas City. 
An outstanding defensive player, the right-handed-hitting Joost hit for 
power but struck out at a higher rate for his era. In a 17-year major league 
playing career (1936–37; 1939–43; 1945; 1947–55) for the Cincinnati Reds, 
Boston Braves, Athletics and Boston Red Sox, Joost smashed 134 home runs, 
with a batting average of .239. During a 1941 game with the Reds, Joost 
fielded 19 balls at shortstop, recording 9 put-outs and 10 assists.[1] 
In 1943, as a Boston Brave, Joost batted .185 in 421 at bats. His somewhat 
high strikeout rate notwithstanding, Joost was a central figure in the 
brief revival of the Athletics in the late 1940s. For three seasons — 1947 
through 1949 — the A's, after over a decade of futility, played over .500 
baseball. Joost was their regular shortstop and one of the team's leaders. 
He twice hit over 20 home runs, and batted .289 in 1951. Joost was an integral 
part of an Athletics' infield that registered the still-unmatched feat 
of turning more than 200 double plays in three consecutive seasons, between 
1949–51. The Athletics' 1949 season mark of 217 double plays remains the 
all-time best in Major League history.[2][3] One factor contributing to 
Joost's performance with the A's was his decision to wear eyeglasses on 
the field, which he had avoided earlier in his career because of the negative 
stereotype of athletes with eyewear at the time. After speaking with A's 
manager Connie Mack, Joost began to wear his glasses while playing — and 
improved his hitting.[4] Despite his low lifetime batting average, Joost 
had excellent patience at the plate, resulting in six straight seasons 
of 100 walks or more, and a career on-base percentage of .361. In 1949, 
he had an OBP of .429, hitting 23 home runs, scoring 128 runs and walking 
149 times. But the Athletics' resurgence after World War II was brief. 
Beset by limited finances and a virtually nonexistent farm system, the 
Mackmen could not compete with the Yankees, Indians and Red Sox. Mack, 
the team's Hall of Fame patriarch and manager, retired at age 87 after 
a disastrous 1950 campaign in which the A's finished dead last in the majors 
with a 52-102 record. Veteran Jimmie Dykes took the helm from 1951–53, 
and — thanks to the American League MVP, pitcher Bobby Shantz — sparked 
one last revival in 1952. But the A's fell to seventh in 1953, prompting 
Dykes' departure. To save money on paying a separate salary for a manager, 
Joost, who had appeared in only 51 games in 1953, became player-manager 
in 1954. He batted .362 in 47 at bats, but the team went 51–103 (.331) 
and Joost was fired after the season ended. Joost continued his playing 
career as a utility infielder for the Red Sox in 1955, and in 1956 briefly 
managed the Pacific Coast League's San Francisco Seals, then the top BoSox 
farm club, in his hometown before leaving the game. He held the Athletics 
record by a shortstop for most home runs during a single season, and in 
a career before Miguel Tejada broke them in 2002.[5] When the Oakland Athletics 
played the Philadelphia Phillies for the first time in interleague play 
in June 2003 at Veterans Stadium, the Phillies invited former-Philadelphia 
A's Joost and Gus Zernial to the games.[6] When the Phillies played the 
Athletics in Oakland in June 2005, the A's invited Joost to throw out the 
first pitch before the series opening game on June 17, 2005.[7] Joost was 
the last living member of the Reds team that won the 1940 World Series. 
At the time of his death, no living player had played on an earlier World
