Leslie Mann (November 18, 1892 – January 14, 1962), was a college football 
player, professional baseball player and football and basketball coach. 
He played outfield in the Major Leagues from 1913 to 1928. He played for 
the Boston Braves, St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds, New York Giants, 
and Chicago Cubs. He was the head basketball coach at Rice Institute (1919–1920 
season) Indiana University (1922–1923 through 1923–1924 seasons) and Springfield 
College (1924–1925 through 1925–1926 seasons). He compiled a career record 
of 43–30 in five seasons as a head basketball coach. Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, 
Mann attended the Y.M.C.A. College in Springfield, Massachusetts.[1] He 
played both football and basketball at Springfield and was regarded as 
"one of the best football players the training school ever had."[2] Mann 
later became a professional baseball player. From 1913 to 1928, he played 
for the Boston Braves, St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds, New York Giants, 
and Chicago Cubs. He was a member of the 1914 "Miracle" Braves team that 
went from last place to first place in two months, becoming the first team 
to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July.[3] The 
team then went on to defeat Connie Mack's heavily favored Philadelphia 
Athletics in the 1914 World Series. Mann also had an RBI single off Babe 
Ruth in Game 4 of the 1918 World Series. Mann also worked for many years 
as a college football and basketball coach. From 1914 to 1916, he was a 
basketball coach at Amherst College.[1][2][4][5] In 1919, he became a coach 
at Rice Institute in Houston.[1] In February 1922, Mann was hired as an 
assistant football coach at Indiana.[1][6] He also coached the Indiana 
Hoosiers men's basketball team during the 1922–1923 and 1923–1924 seasons.[7] 
Starting in 1924, Mann was hired as the head basketball coach and assistant 
football coach at Springfield College in Springfield, Massachusetts.[8] 
After retiring as a player and coach, Mann became an advocate for baseball 
as an international sport. He founded the U.S.A. Baseball Congress, and 
organized a 20-game tour of Japan in 1935. Through his efforts, baseball 
was selected as a demonstration sport in the 1936 Summer Olympics played 
in Berlin. Originally, the United States team was scheduled to play a Japanese 
team, but the Japanese withdrew. The American team was separated into two 
squads who competed against each other in a single game. The "World Champions" 
lineup beat the "U. S. Olympics" lineup by a score of 6–5 before a crowd 
of 90,000 people on August 12, 1936.[9] Mann went on to found the International 
Baseball Federation, which organized an international championship in England 
in 1938. The English team, composed mainly of Canadian college players, 
won 4 out of 5 games against an amateur American team. He also organized 
subsequent championships in Cuba in 1939 and Puerto Rico in 1941. World 
War II brought Mann's efforts to an end.[10] He died in Pasadena, California.
