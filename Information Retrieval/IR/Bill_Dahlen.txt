As Player As Manager William Frederick Dahlen (January 5, 1870 – December 
5, 1950), nicknamed "Bad Bill" for his ferocious temperament, was an American 
shortstop and manager in Major League Baseball who played for four National 
League teams from 1891 to 1911. After twice batting over .350 for the Chicago 
Colts, he starred on championship teams with the Brooklyn Superbas and 
the New York Giants. At the end of his career he held the major league 
record for career games played (2,443); he ranked second in walks (1,064, 
behind Billy Hamilton's 1,187) and fifth in at bats (9,033), and was among 
the top ten in runs batted in (1,234), doubles (414) and extra base hits 
(661). He was also among the NL's top seven players in hits (2,461; some 
sources list totals up to 2,471), runs (1,589), triples (163) and total 
bases (3,447). After leading the league in assists four times and double 
plays three times, he set major league records for career games (2,132), 
putouts (4,850), assists (7,500), total chances (13,325) and double plays 
(881) as a shortstop; he still holds the record for total chances, and 
is second in putouts and fourth in assists. His 42-game hitting streak 
in 1894 was a record until 1897, and remains the fourth longest in history 
and the longest by a right-handed NL hitter. Dahlen was born in Nelliston, 
New York at the corner of Berthoud and Dahlen and East Main. He was a very 
good hitter and had a good amount of power for the dead-ball era. He began 
his career with the Colts in 1891, and during his eight years with the 
team finished among the NL's top ten players in home runs four times and 
in slugging average three times. He also scored over 100 runs with 10 or 
more triples in each of his first six seasons; in 1894 he posted the highest 
batting average to that time by a major league shortstop (various sources 
state .357 or .362), and he followed with a .352 average in 1896. His 1894 
season included a record 42-game hitting streak from June 20 to August 
6, surpassing the 33-game streak by George Davis one year earlier. Amazingly, 
after going 0-for-6 in the next game, a 10-inning contest on August 7, 
Dahlen pulled off another 28-game streak, ending up having hit in 70 of 
71 games. His mark was broken three years later by Willie Keeler, who hit 
in 44 straight; that NL record was eventually tied by Pete Rose. Only Joe 
DiMaggio, with his 56-game streak in 1941, has bettered Dahlen's mark among 
right-handed batters. Dahlen also twice hit three triples in a game, and 
once he tripled twice in one inning (August 30, 1900). Prior to the 1899 
season, Dahlen was traded by Chicago, and ended up in Brooklyn after another 
deal. His new team won the NL title in each of his first two seasons, and 
although his batting average had dropped from that of earlier years, he 
compensated by continuing to accumulate numerous walks and stolen bases 
and by playing outstanding defense. In 1902, he finished fourth in the 
NL with 74 RBI. In 1903 he set an NL record for fielding percentage with 
a .948 average, breaking George Wright's 1878 mark of .947; Tommy Corcoran 
broke his record in 1905 with a .952 average. After the 1903 season, Dahlen 
was traded to the Giants, the team he'd always strived to play for, in 
exchange for pitcher Jack Cronin and Charlie Babb. While Cronin and Babb 
contributed only three bad years to Brooklyn, Dahlen posted great numbers 
with the Giants, leading the league with 80 RBI in his first year, 1904. 
In 1905 he was again among the RBI leaders, despite hitting only .242, 
as the Giants won their first World Series title. Although he was hitless 
in the five-game Series, he contributed with flawless defense and by drawing 
three walks and stealing three bases. He was often considered one of the 
quietest players in the game, keeping to himself most of the time. After 
the 1907 season, he was traded to the Boston Doves, for whom he played 
his last two full seasons. In 1909 he broke Jake Beckley's record of 2386 
career games; his record was broken in turn by Honus Wagner in 1914. He 
was named Brooklyn's manager for the 1910 season, but never finished above 
6th place in four seasons. His last playing appearances were three games 
as a pinch-hitter in 1910, and one game at shortstop in 1911. In a 21-season 
career, Dahlen batted .272; his 84 home runs were then among the fifteen 
highest totals in history, and ranked behind only Herman Long (91) among 
shortstops. His 289 stolen bases after the statistic was redefined in 1898 
were then among the ten highest totals, as were his 547 total steals since 
they were first recorded in 1887. His records for games and putouts at 
shortstop were broken by Rabbit Maranville, and his mark for assists was 
surpassed by Luis Aparicio, with his NL record standing until Ozzie Smith 
broke it in 1993; his record for double plays was broken by Roger Peckinpaugh. 
Dahlen's 14,566 total chances at all positions have been surpassed by only 
Maranville (16,091) and Wagner (15,536). In four years as a manager, all 
for Brooklyn, he posted a 251-355 record for a .414 winning percentage; 
he earned his nickname with a ferocious arguing style which drew 65 ejections 
as a manager, still among the top ten in history. Dahlen died in Brooklyn 
after a long illness at age 80, and was buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens, 
Brooklyn, New York City, New York. As of 2006, his grave remains unmarked. 
In August 2008, he was named as one of ten former players who began their 
careers before 1943 to be considered by the Veterans Committee for induction 
into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009. The Nineteenth Century 
Committee of the Society for American Baseball Research named Dahlen the 
Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legend for 2012 — a 19th-century player, 
manager, executive or other baseball personality not yet inducted into 
the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. Dahlen was 
featured in David Pietrusza's 1995 television documentary "Local Heroes" 
in the segment "Knocking on Cooperstown's Door." Dahlen was included on 
the Veterans Committee ballot for 2013 induction to the Hall of Fame. The 
results were announced on December 3, 2012. Dahlen received 10 out of 16 
votes, falling 2 votes short of election, the highest total of any person 
on the ballot who was not elected and will have to wait until the end of
