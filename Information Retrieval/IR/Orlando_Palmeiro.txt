Orlando Palmeiro (born January 19, 1969) is a former Major League Baseball 
outfielder. He attended high school at Miami Southridge High School and 
played college baseball at the University of Miami.[1] Palmeiro, a star 
high school player in Miami, Florida, went on to play baseball at the community 
college level at Miami-Dade Community College South and then briefly at 
the University of Miami under UM coach Ron Fraser before being drafted 
by the Angels where he played for a number of years in various farm teams 
until joining the California Angels. Palmeiro spent his entire career as 
a backup outfielder, never having been a regular starter. He was the fourth

had a low percentage of swings that miss (7.9%) and was considered one 
of the game's best pinch hitters with 105 career pinch hits.[citation needed]
