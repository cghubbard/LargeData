Paterson is the largest city in and the county seat of Passaic County, 
New Jersey, United States.[19][20] As of the 2010 United States Census, 
its population was 146,199,[9][10][11] rendering it New Jersey's third-most-populous 
city.[21] Paterson has the second-highest density of any U.S. city with 
over 100,000 people, behind only New York City.[22] For 2015, the Census 
Bureau's Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 147,754, 
an increase of 1.1% from the 2010 enumeration,[12] ranking the city the 
177th-largest in the nation.[23] Paterson is known as the "Silk City" for 
its dominant role in silk production during the latter half of the 19th 
century.[1] The city has since evolved into a major destination for Hispanic 
emigrants as well as for immigrants from the Arab and Muslim world. It 
has the second-largest Muslim population in the United States.[24] The 
area of Paterson was inhabited by the Algonquian-speaking Native American 
Acquackanonk tribe of the Lenape, referred to as the Delaware Indians. 
The land was known as the Lenapehoking. The Dutch claimed the land as New 
Netherlands, then the British as the Province of New Jersey.[25] In 1791 
Alexander Hamilton (1755/57-1804), first United States Secretary of the 
Treasury, helped found the Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures 
(S.U.M.), which helped encourage the harnessing of energy from the Great 
Falls of the Passaic River to secure economic independence from British 
manufacturers. Paterson, which was founded by the society, became the cradle 
of the industrial revolution in America.[26] Paterson was named for William 
Paterson, statesman, signer of the Constitution and Governor of New Jersey 
who signed the 1792 charter that established the Town of Paterson.[27][28] 
Architect, engineer and city planner Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant (1754-1825), 
who had earlier developed the initial plans for Washington, D.C., was the 
first planner for the S.U.M. project.[29] His plan proposed to harness 
the power of the Great Falls through a channel in the rock and an aqueduct. 
However, the society's directors felt he was taking too long and was over 
budget, and he was replaced by Peter Colt, who used a less complicated 
reservoir system to get the water flowing to factories in 1794. Eventually 
Colt's system developed some problems and a scheme resembling L'Enfant's 
original plan was used after 1846.[30] Paterson was originally formed as 
a township from portions of Acquackanonk Township on April 11, 1831, while 
the area was still part of Essex County. Paterson became part of newly 
created Passaic County on February 7, 1837. It was incorporated as a city 
on April 14, 1851, based on the results of a referendum held that day. 
The city was reincorporated on March 14, 1861.[31] The industries developed 
in Paterson were powered by the 77-foot-high Great Falls and a system of 
water raceways that harnessed the power of the falls, providing power for 
the mills in the area until 1914 and fostering the growth of the city around 
the mills.[32] The district originally included dozens of mill buildings 
and other manufacturing structures associated with the textile industry 
and, later, the firearms, silk and railroad locomotive manufacturing industries. 
In the latter half of the 19th century silk production became the dominant 
industry and formed the basis of Paterson's most prosperous period, earning 
it the nickname "Silk City."[33] In 1835 Samuel Colt began producing firearms 
in Paterson, although within a few years he moved his business to Hartford, 
Connecticut. Later in the 19th century Paterson was the site of early experiments 
with submarines by Irish-American inventor John Philip Holland. Two of 
Holland's early models — one found at the bottom of the Passaic River — 
are on display in the Paterson Museum, housed in the former Rogers Locomotive 
and Machine Works near the Passaic Falls.[34] The city was a mecca for 
immigrant laborers who worked in its factories, particularly Italian weavers 
from the Naples region. Paterson was the site of historic labor unrest 
that focused on anti-child labor legislation, and the six-month-long Paterson 
silk strike of 1913 that demanded the eight-hour day and better working 
conditions. It was defeated by the employers, with workers forced to return 
under pre-strike conditions. Factory workers labored long hours for low 
wages under dangerous conditions and lived in crowded tenement buildings 
around the mills. The factories then moved to the South, where there were 
no labor unions, and still later moved overseas. In 1919 Paterson was one 
of eight locations bombed by self-identified anarchists.[35] In 1932 Paterson 
opened Hinchliffe Stadium, a 10,000-seat stadium named in honor of John 
V. Hinchliffe, the city's mayor at the time. Hinchliffe Stadium originally 
served as the site for high school and professional athletic events. From 
1933-37 and 1939–45, Hinchliffe was the home of the New York Black Yankees 
and from 1935-36 the home of the New York Cubans of the Negro National 
League.[36] The historic ballpark was also a venue for many professional 
football games, track and field events, boxing matches and auto and motorcycle 
racing. The comedy team of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello performed at Hinchliffe 
prior to boxing matches (Abbott was from the southern New Jersey city of 
Asbury Park, but Costello was a Paterson native). Hinchliffe is one of 
only three Negro League stadiums left standing in the United States and 
is on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1963 the Paterson Public 
Schools acquired the stadium and used it for public school events until 
1997, but it is currently in a state of disrepair while the schools have 
been taken over by the state.[37] During World War II Paterson played an 
important part in the aircraft engine industry. By the end of WWII, however, 
there was a decline in urban areas and Paterson was no exception, and since 
the late 1960s the city has suffered high unemployment rates and white 
flight.[38] Once a premier shopping and leisure destination of northern 
New Jersey, competition from malls in upscale neighboring towns like Wayne 
and Paramus have forced the big chain stores out of Paterson's downtown.[citation 
needed] The biggest industries are now small businesses, with the decline 
of the city's industrial base. However, the city still, as always, attracts 
many immigrants, who have revived the city's economy, especially through 
small businesses.[39] The downtown area has been struck by massive fires 
several times, most recently on January 17, 1991. In this fire a near full 
city block (bordered on the north and south by Main Street and Washington 
Street and on the east and west by Ellison Street and College Boulevard, 
a stretch of Van Houten Street that is dominated by Passaic County Community 
College) was engulfed in flames due to an electrical fire in the basement 
of a bar at 161 Main Street and spread to other buildings.[40] Firefighter 
John A. Nicosia, 28, of Engine 4 went missing in the fire, having gotten 
lost in the basement. His body was recovered two days later.[41] A plaque 
honoring his memory was later placed on a wall near the area. The area 
was so badly damaged that most of the burned buildings were demolished, 
with an outdoor mall standing in their place. The most notable of the destroyed 
buildings was the Meyer Brothers department store, which closed in 1987 
and had since been parceled out. Paterson includes numerous locations listed 
on the National Register of Historic Places, including museums, civic buildings 
such as City Hall, Hinchliffe Stadium, Public School Number Two and the 
Danforth Memorial Library, churches (Cathedral of St. John the Baptist 
and St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church), individual residences and districts 
of the city, such as the Paterson Downtown Commercial Historic District, 
the Great Falls/Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures Historic 
District and the Eastside Park Historic District. Hijackers in the September 
11 attacks, Hani Hanjour, Nawaf Alhazmi, Salem Alhazmi, Majed Moqed, Abdulaziz 
Alomari, Khalid Almihdhar, and probably Ahmed Alghamdi, rented and lived 
in an apartment from March to September 2001.[42] In August 2011, Paterson 
was severely affected in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene, particularly 
by flooding of the Passaic River, where waters rose to levels unseen for 
100 years, leading to the displacement of thousands and the closure of 
bridges over the river.[43] Touring the area with Federal Emergency Management 
Agency Administrator Craig Fugate, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet 
Napolitano declared, "This is as bad as I've seen, and I've been in eight 
states that have been impacted by Irene." The same day, President Obama 
declared New Jersey a disaster area,[44] and announced that he would visit 
the city.[45][46][47] According to the United States Census Bureau, the 
city had a total area of 8.704 square miles (22.544 km2), including 8.428 
square miles (21.829 km2) of land and 0.276 square miles (0.715 km2) of 
water (3.17%).[2][3] Unincorporated communities, localities and place names 
located partially or completely within the city include Riverside and Totowa.[48] 
The city borders the municipalities of Clifton, Haledon, Hawthorne, Prospect 
Park, Totowa and Woodland Park (formerly West Paterson) in Passaic County; 
and both Elmwood Park (formerly East Paterson) and Fair Lawn in Bergen 
County.[49] The Great Falls Historic District is the most famous neighborhood 
in Paterson because of the landmark Great Falls of the Passaic River. The 
city has attempted to revitalize the area in recent years, including the 
installation of period lamp posts and the conversion of old industrial 
buildings into apartments and retail venues. Many artists live in this 
section of Paterson. A major redevelopment project is planned for this 
district in the coming years. The Paterson Museum of industrial history 
at Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works is situated in the Historic District.[50] 
Downtown Paterson is the main commercial district of the city and was once 
a shopping destination for many who lived in northern New Jersey. After 
a devastating fire in 1902, the city rebuilt the downtown with massive 
Beaux-Arts-style buildings, many of which remain to this day. These buildings 
are usually four to seven stories tall. Downtown Paterson is home to Paterson 
City Hall and the Passaic County Courthouse Annex, two of the city's architectural 
landmarks. City Hall was designed by the New York firm Carrere and Hastings 
in 1894, and was modeled after the Hôtel de Ville (city hall) in Lyon, 
France, capital of the silk industry in Europe.[51] The former Orpheum 
Theatre located on Van Houten Street has been converted to a mosque by 
the Islamic Foundation of New Jersey. The massive structure, now known 
as Masjid Jalalabad, can accommodate 1,500 worshipers.[52] As with many 
other old downtown districts in the United States, Downtown Paterson suffered 
as shoppers and retailers moved to the suburban shopping malls of the region. 
Many historic buildings are in disrepair or are abandoned after years of 
neglect. In addition, Downtown Paterson is an Urban Enterprise Zone. The 
city has, in recent years, begun initiatives in hopes of reviving the downtown 
area with the centerpiece being the Center City Mall, constructed on a 
large parking lot spanning Ward Street from Main to Church Streets and 
features retail, entertainment, and commercial space. Downtown Paterson 
is located in the city's 1st Ward. Eastside Park Historic District consists 
of about 1,000 homes in a variety of architectural styles, including Tudors, 
Georgian colonials, Victorians, Italianate villas and Dutch colonials. 
It is located east of downtown. Once the home of the city's industrial 
and political leaders, the neighborhood experienced a significant downturn 
as industry fled Paterson. In recent years, gentrification has begun to 
occur in the neighborhood and some of the area's historic houses have been 
restored. The Eastside Park Historic District is a state and nationally 
registered historic place. The jewel of the neighborhood is Eastside Park 
and the mansions that surround it. This section of Paterson once had a 
large Jewish population that reached 40,000 at its peak; a synagogue still 
remains.[53] Eastside Park and what is commonly known as the Upper Eastside 
are located in Paterson's 3rd Ward. East River Section is a section that 
is referred to by locals roughly bordering Riverside at 5th Avenue and 
extending south to Broadway, sandwiched in by Madison Avenue to McClean 
Boulevard (Route 20). However, the neighborhood's layout unofficially extends 
to the "Paterson-Newark/Hudson Route" of River Road in the Paterson-Memorial 
Park section of Fair Lawn (whose house addresses are in alignment with 
the now defunct Jewish synagogue on the corner of 33rd Street and Broadway), 
which connects Paterson to Newark/Hudson, and at one time was a Main Route 
through River Drive (which starts in Elmwood Park and rides north to south 
along the East Bank of the Passaic River in Paterson's original county). 
Built when Paterson was still Bergen County, River Drive changes to River 
Road in the greater Eastside Sections of Upper Eastside-Manor Section, 
East River, and Riverside Sections, and turns into Wagaraw Road north of 
1st Avenue / Maple Avenue in the old Bunker Hill extension of Columbia 
Heights in Fair Lawn (an indication of not only entering the Industrial 
Section, but also entering the foothills of the Ramapo Mountains in Hawthorne). 
River Drive then turns into East Main Street to indicate that you have 
entered the Northside Section. The East River neighborhood which was and 
still maintains its "blue collar" working-class identity, was at one time 
known for its large Jewish community, as well as a Neapolitan/Italian population 
and more recently other Mediterranean and Adriatic Europeans, Caribbean 
and South Americans, and other modern immigrant groups from all over the 
world, as well as African-Americans. Manor Section is a residential neighborhood 
in Paterson. It is located east of East 33rd Street, north of Broadway, 
and south-west of Route 20 and the Passaic River. The Manor section of 
Paterson is located in the city's 3rd Ward. The layout and culture of the 
Manor Section also extends into the neighboring Lyncrest and Rivercrest 
sections of Fair Lawn, with all the addresses aligning themselves to the 
now defunct Jewish Temple, located at the corner of 33rd and Broadway. 
South Paterson, also known as Little Istanbul or Little Ramallah, is a 
diverse neighborhood with a growing number of immigrants from the Middle 
East, with significant Arab and Turkish communities. The neighborhood is 
located in the 6th Ward, east of Main Street and west of West Railway Avenue. 
A majority of the city's Arabs live in this section of Paterson. Many of 
the retail shops and restaurants cater to this community. The neighborhood 
is characterized by Halal meat markets which offer goat and lamb; and shop 
signs are in Arabic. South Paterson's Arab community is mostly made up 
of Jordanians, Palestinians,[54] Syrians,[55][56] and Lebanese.[57] Lakeview 
is situated in the southern part of the city, and is a middle class neighborhood. 
Interstate 80 runs north of this district. Lakeview is home to the Paterson 
Farmers Market, where many people from across North Jersey come to buy 
fresh produce. The neighborhood is roughly 65% Hispanic, although this 
neighborhood also has sizable European, Middle-Eastern, African-American, 
and Asian populations, including a significant Filipino presence. Lakeview 
also shares some of the same characteristics as neighboring Clifton as 
they both share a neighborhood bearing the same name. The Lakeview section 
of Paterson is located in the city's 6th Ward. Hillcrest is a largely residential, 
middle class enclave, to the west of the downtown area. Its borders' limits 
are Preakness Avenue to the east, Cumberland Avenue to the west, and Totowa 
Avenue along with West Side Park and the Passaic River to the south. Hillcrest 
is one of Paterson's most desirable neighborhoods. The Hillcrest section 
of Paterson is located in the city's 2nd Ward. People's Park is a neighborhood 
located north of 23rd Avenue and south of Market Street. Twenty-First Avenue 
or "La Ventiuno" as it's known by most of Paterson's Spanish-speaking community, 
is located in the People's Park section of Paterson. It is an active and 
vibrant retail strip featuring a variety of shops and services catering 
to a diverse clientele. Twenty First Avenue used to have a large Italian 
population. Although there is still a significant Italian presence left 
in the neighborhood, it also has a large first-generation Hispanic population, 
particularly Colombian. Wrigley Park is a neighborhood that has suffered 
from years of poverty, crime, and neglect. It is mostly African-American. 
Poverty, crime, open-air drug markets, prostitution, vacant lots, and boarded-up 
windows are all common in this area. However, there are new houses being 
built, and crime has dropped in recent years. This neighborhood is located 
north of Broadway. It is also known as the '4th Ward'. Sandy Hill is a 
neighborhood in the Eastside located roughly west of Madison Avenue, north 
of 21st Avenue, south of Park Avenue, and east of Straight Street. Due 
to Paterson's significant population turn-over, this neighborhood is now 
home to a large and growing Hispanic community, mostly first-generation 
Dominicans. The Sandy Hill section of Paterson is located in the city's 
5th Ward. Roberto Clemente Park, which was originally known as Sandy Hill 
Park, is located in this neighborhood. Part of the 5th Ward is called Near 
Eastside by residents to differentiate it from the Eastside Park Historic 
District to its immediate east. Northside, located north of Downtown, suffers 
from many of the social problems currently facing the Wrigley Park neighborhood, 
but to a lesser extent. This neighborhood borders the boroughs of Haledon 
and Prospect Park and is known for its hills and sweeping views of the 
New York City skyline. The Northside section of Paterson is located in 
the city's 1st Ward. Totowa section is a large neighborhood located west 
of the Passaic River, south-west of West Broadway and north-east of Preakness 
Avenue. As the name implies, it borders the town of Totowa. It is mostly 
Hispanic but with an increasing South Asian community, mainly Bangladeshi. 
Many Bengali grocery and clothing stores are located on Union Avenue and 
the surrounding streets. Masjid Al-Ferdous is located on Union Avenue, 
which accommodates the daily Bangladeshi pedestrian population. A large 
Italian presence remains in this neighborhood. Many Peruvian and other 
Latin American restaurants and businesses are located on Union Avenue. 
Colonial Village and Brooks Sloate Terraces are located in this neighborhood. 
The Totowa Section is located in parts of the 1st and 2nd Wards of Paterson. 
Stoney Road is Paterson's most south-west neighborhood, bordering Woodland 
Park to the south and Totowa across the Passaic River to the west. This 
neighborhood is home to Pennington Park, Hayden Heights, Lou Costello Pool, 
the Levine reservoir, Murray Avenue, Mc Bride Avenue, and Garret Heights. 
A strong Italian presence remains in this neighborhood. The Stoney Road 
section of Paterson is located in the city's 2nd Ward. Riverside is a larger 
neighborhood in Paterson and, as its name suggests, is bound by the Passaic 
River to the north and east, separating the city from Hawthorne and Fair 
Lawn. Riverside is a working-class neighborhood. The neighborhood is mostly 
residential with some industrial uses. Madison Avenue cuts through the 
heart of this district. Route 20 runs through the eastern border of Riverside, 
providing an easy commute to Route 80 East and New York City. This section 
is ethnically diverse with a growing Hispanic community concentrating mostly 
north and along River Street. Many Albanians make their home in the East 
18th Street and River Street areas. River View Terrace is located in this 
neighborhood. Riverside is located in parts of the 3rd and 4th Wards of 
Paterson. Bunker Hill is a mostly industrial area west of River Street 
and east of the Passaic River. Westside Park located off Totowa Avenue 
and best known as the site of the Holland submarine, Fenian Ram, which 
was built in 1879-1881[58] for the Fenian Brotherhood. It became the target 
of graffiti artists because the fence surrounding it was too low and too 
close to the submarine itself. The sub is now located in Paterson Museum.[59] 
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally 
cool to cold winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, 
Paterson has a humid continental climate, abbreviated "Dfa" on climate 
maps.[60] According to Mayor Jose Torres, Paterson had 52 distinct ethnic 
groups in 2014.[74] Paterson's rapidly growing Bangladeshi American,[75] 
Turkish American, Arab American,[76] Palestinian American,[54] Albanian 
American, Dominican American, and Peruvian American communities are among 
the largest and most prominent in the United States, the latter owing partially 
to the presence of the Consulate of Peru.[77] Paterson's Muslim population 
has been estimated at 25,000 to 30,000.[1] Paterson has become a prime 
destination for one of the fastest-growing communities of Dominican Americans, 
who have become the city's largest ethnic group.[78] The Puerto Rican American 
population has established a highly significant presence as well.[79] Demographic 
surveys and census data find Paterson has the highest percentage of disabled 
persons of any city with more than 100,000 residents, with about 30% of 
males and 29% of females not classified as poor listed as having a disability.[80] 
At the 2010 United States Census, there were 146,199 people, 44,329 households, 
and 32,715 families residing in the city. The population density was 17,346.3 
per square mile (6,697.4/km2). There were 47,946 housing units at an average 
density of 5,688.7 per square mile (2,196.4/km2). The racial makeup of 
the city was 34.68% (50,706) White, 31.68% (46,314) Black or African American, 
1.06% (1,547) Native American, 3.34% (4,878) Asian, 0.04% (60) Pacific 
Islander, 23.94% (34,999) from other races, and 5.26% (7,695) from two 
or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 57.63% (84,254) of 
the population.[9] There were 44,329 households, of which 38.7% had children 
under the age of 18 living with them, 35.4% were married couples living 
together, 29.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.2% 
were non-families. 21.0% of all households were made up of individuals, 
and 7.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 3.24 and the average family size was 3.71.[9] 
In the city, 27.9% of the population were under the age of 18, 11.4% from 
18 to 24, 29.0% from 25 to 44, 22.9% from 45 to 64, and 8.9% who were 65 
years of age or older. The median age was 32.1 years. For every 100 females 
there were 93.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 
89.9 males.[9] Same-sex couples headed 290 households in 2010, a decline 
from the 349 counted in 2000.[81] The Census Bureau's 2006-2010 American 
Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median 
household income was $34,086 (with a margin of error of +/- $1,705) and 
the median family income was $39.003 (+/- $2,408). Males had a median income 
of $30,811 (+/- $825) versus $28,459 (+/- $1,570) for females. The per 
capita income for the city was $15,543 (+/- $467). About 24.1% of families 
and 26.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 39.0% 
of those under age 18 and 25.4% of those age 65 or over.[82] As of the 
2000 United States Census[16] there were 149,222 people, 44,710 households, 
and 33,353 families residing in the city, for a population density of 17,675.4 
per square mile (6,826.4/km2).[72][73] Among cities with a population higher 
than 100,000, Paterson was the second most densely populated large city 
in the United States, only after New York City.[83] There were 47,169 housing 
units at an average density of 5,587.2 per square mile (2,157.8/km2). The 
racial makeup of the city was 32.90% African American, 13.20% White, 0.60%

races and 6.17% from two or more races. Latino of any race were 50.1% of 
the population.[72][73] The majority of Latinos are Puerto Rican 14%, Dominican 
10%, Peruvian 5% and Colombian 3%.[84] There were 44,710 households out 
of which 40.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 39.4% 
were married couples living together, 26.8% had a female householder with 
no husband present, and 25.4% were non-families. 20.4% of all households

income for a household in the city was $30,127, and the median income for 
a family was $32,983. Males had a median income of $27,911 versus $21,733 
for females. The per capita income for the city was $13,257. About 19.2% 
of families and 22.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 
29.0% of those under age 18 and 19.4% of those age 65 or over.[72][73] 
Since its early beginnings, Paterson has been a melting pot. Irish, Germans, 
Dutch, and Jews settled in the city in the 19th century. Italian and Eastern 
European immigrants soon followed. As early as 1890, Syrian and Lebanese 
immigrants also arrived in Paterson. In addition to many African Americans 
of Southern heritage, more recent immigrants have come from the Caribbean 
and Africa. Paterson's black population increased during the Great Migration 
of the 20th century, but there have been Patersonians of African descent 
since before the Civil War. However, Paterson's black population declined 
between the years 2000 and 2010,[85] consistent with the overall return 
migration of African Americans from Northern New Jersey back to the Southern 
United States.[86] A house once existing at Bridge Street and Broadway 
was a station on the Underground Railroad. It was operated from 1855 to 
1864 by abolitionists William Van Rensalier, a black engineer, and Josiah 
Huntoon, a white industrialist.[87] There is a memorial located at the 
site.[88][89] Many second- and third-generation Puerto Ricans have called 
Paterson home since the 1950s, including an estimated 10,000 who participated 
in the 2014 mayoral election, which was won by Jose "Joey" Torres, a Puerto 
Rican American who was one of three Hispanic candidates vying for the seat.[79] 
Today's Hispanic immigrants to Paterson are primarily Dominican, Peruvian, 
Colombian, Mexican, and Central American, with a resurgence of Puerto Rican 
migration as well. In 2014, more than 600 business people attended the 
annual Statewide Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of New Jersey Convention 
in Paterson.[90] Western Market Street, sometimes called Little Lima by 
tourists, is home to many Peruvian and other Latin-American businesses. 
In contrast, if one travels east on Market Street, a heavy concentration 
of Dominican-owned restaurants, beauty salons, barber shops and other businesses 
can be seen. The Great Falls Historic District, Cianci Street, Union Avenue 
and 21st Avenue have several Italian businesses. To the north of the Great 
Falls is a fast-growing Bangladeshi population. Park Avenue and Market 
Street between Straight Street and Madison Avenue are heavily Dominican 
and Puerto Rican. Main Street, just south of downtown, is heavily Mexican 
with a declining Puerto-Rican community. Broadway — also called Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. Way — is predominantly black, as is the Fourth Ward and 
parts of Eastside and Northside. Costa Ricans and other Central American 
immigrant communities are growing in the Riverside and Peoples Park neighborhoods. 
Main Street between the Clifton border and Madison Avenue is heavily Turkish 
and Arab. 21st Avenue in the People's Park section is characterized by 
Colombian and other Latin American restaurants and shops. Every summer, 
Patersonians conduct an African-American Day Parade, a Dominican Day Parade, 
a Puerto Rican Day Parade, a Peruvian Day Parade, and a Turkish-American 
Day Parade; budget cuts in 2011 have forced parade organizers to contribute 
to cover the costs of police and other municipal services.[91] Paterson 
is considered by many as the capital of the Peruvian Diaspora in the U.S.[92] 
Paterson's rapidly growing Peruvian community celebrates what is known 
as Señor de los Milagros ("Our Lord of Miracles" in English) on October 
18 through 28th each year and every July participates in the annual Passaic 
County Peruvian Day Parade, which passes through Market Street and Main 
Street in the Little Lima neighborhood of Downtown Paterson.[93] In the 
2000 Census, 4.72% of residents listed themselves as being of Peruvian 
American ancestry, the third-highest percentage of the population of any 
municipality in New Jersey and the United States, behind East Newark with 
10.1% and Harrison with 7.01%.[94] The community includes both Quechua 
and Spanish speakers.[95] Paterson is home to the third-largest Dominican-American 
Community in the United States, after New York City and Lawrence, Massachusetts. 
In the 2000 Census, 10.27% of residents listed themselves as being of Dominican 
American ancestry, the eighth highest percentage of the population of any 
municipality in the United States and the third highest percentage in New 
Jersey, behind Perth Amboy's 18.81% and Union City's 11.46%.[96] Paterson 
is home to the largest Turkish-American immigrant community in the United 
States (Little Istanbul) and the second largest Arab-American community 
after Dearborn, Michigan.[76] Paterson has been nicknamed Little Ramallah 
and contains a neighborhood with the same name in South Paterson, with 
an Arab American population estimated as high as 20,000 in 2015,[97][98] 
serving as the center of Paterson's growing Syrian American[55][56] and 
Palestinian American populations.[54] The Paterson-based Arab American 
Civic Association runs an Arabic language program in the Paterson Public 
Schools that serves 125 students at School 9 on Saturdays.[99] Paterson 
is also home to the largest Circassian immigrant community in the United 
States.[100] The Greater Paterson area which includes the cities of Clifton 
and Wayne and the boroughs of Haledon, Prospect Park, North Haledon, Totowa, 
Woodland Park, and Little Falls, is home to the nation's largest North 
Caucasian population, mostly Circassians, Karachays, and small Chechen 
and Dagestani communities. Reflective of these communities, Paterson and 
Prospect Park public schools observe Muslim holidays.[101] Paterson has 
incorporated a rapidly growing Bangladeshi American community, which is 
estimated to number 15,000,[102] the largest in the United States outside 
New York City.[103] Mohammed Akhtaruzzaman was ultimately certified as 
the winner of the 2012 city council race in the Second Ward, making him 
North Jersey's first Bangladeshi-American elected official.[104] A branch 
of the Sonali Exchange Company Inc. has opened on Union Avenue in the Totowa 
Section; the Sonali Exchange Company is a subsidiary of Sonali Bank, the 
largest state-owned commercial bank in Bangladesh. Portions of Paterson 
are part of an Urban Enterprise Zone. In addition to other benefits to 
encourage employment within the Zone, shoppers can take advantage of a 
reduced 3½% sales tax rate (versus the 7% rate charged statewide) at eligible 
merchants.[105] Paterson has a significant parks and recreation system, 
including larger areas such as Eastside, Westside and Pennington Parks, 
as well as neighborhood parks such as Wrigley, Robert Clemente, and People's.[106] 
The Great Falls of the Passaic are part of the state park system. The Paterson 
Museum, located in the Great Falls Historic District, was founded in 1925 
and is owned and operated by the city of Paterson. Its mission is to preserve 
and display the industrial history of the city. Since 1982, the museum 
has been housed in the Thomas Rogers Building on Market Street, the former 
erecting shop of Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works, a major 19th-century 
manufacturer of railroad steam locomotives.[107] Belle Vista, locally known 
as Lambert Castle, was built in 1892 as the home of Catholina Lambert, 
the self-made owner of a prominent silk mill in Paterson. After Lambert's 
death in 1923, his family sold the building to the city, which in turn 
sold it to the County of Passaic a few years later. The county used the 
building for administrative offices, and in 1936, provided one room to 
the fledgling Passaic County Historical Society to serve as its historical 
museum. As time went by the museum grew, room by room, until the entire 
first floor became the historical museum. In the late 1990s, the Castle 
underwent a multi-million-dollar restoration and all four floors of the 
building were developed into a museum and library. Today, Passaic County 
remains the owner of the building and supports the facilities' operation; 
however, the Passaic County Historical Society is solely responsible for 
the operation and management of Lambert Castle Museum with its historical 
period rooms, long-term and changing exhibition galleries, educational 
programs for elementary and middle-school students, and research library/archive.[108] 
Above Lambert Castle stands a 75-foot (23 m) observation tower, located 
at the peak of Garret Mountain, which while technically standing in Woodland 
Park, was constructed when the property was considered part of Paterson. 
The tower is part of the Garret Mountain Reservation and renovations were 
completed in 2009 to restore the tower to the original condition as built 
in 1896 by Lambert, who used the tower to impress guests with its view 
of the New York City skyline.[109] Attempts were being made to fund the 
restoration of the Paterson Armory as a recreation and cultural center, 
but the building was destroyed by fire before these could bear fruit.[110] 
The City of Paterson operates within the Faulkner Act, formally known as 
the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under a Plan-D Mayor-Council form of 
government, which was adopted in 1974 in a change from a 1907 statute-based 
form.[7][111] Under the Mayor-Council plan, the Mayor is the chief executive 
and is responsible for administering the City's activities. The Mayor is 
elected at-large for a four-year term by the citizens and is responsible 
for them. The mayor enforces the charter and the ordinances and laws passed 
by the City Council. The Mayor appoints all department heads including 
the business administrator, with the advice and consent of the Council 
and may remove any department heads after giving them notice and an opportunity 
to be heard. With the assistance of the business administrator, the Mayor 
is responsible for preparation of the municipal budget. The Mayor submits 
the budget to the Council along with a detailed analysis of expenditures 
and revenues. The Council may reduce any item or items in the budget by 
a majority vote, but can only increase an item by a two-thirds vote. The 
City Council consists of nine seats. Of these, six are elected through 
use of the ward system, where candidates run to represent a certain area 
of the city. The other three seats are elected using the at-large system, 
where each candidate is voted upon by the entire voting population of the 
city. Municipal elections are held in even numbered years, are non-partisan, 
and take place in early May. The six members of the City Council representing 
their wards are elected in the same years as Presidential elections, while 
the mayoral election and the at-large Council elections are held in the 
same years as the mid-term Congressional elections. As of 2016[update], 
the Mayor of Paterson is José "Joey" Torres, whose term ends on June 30, 
2018.[4] Torres is in his third term as Mayor of Paterson, having first 
been elected by defeating incumbent Martin G. Barnes in 2002 and then winning 
re-election in 2006 against Lawrence Spagnola. After losing his bid for 
a third consecutive term by a margin of 600 votes to City Council President 
Jeffery Jones in 2010, Torres defeated Jones in a rematch four years later.[112] 
Members of the City Council are Council President William McKoy (Third 
Ward; 2020), Council Vice President Domingo "Alex" Mendez (at-large; 2018), 
Ruby N. Cotton (Fourth Ward; 2020), Maritza Davila (at-large; 2018), Michael 
Jackson (First Ward; 2020), Shahin Khalique (Second Ward; 2020), Kenneth 
M. Morris, Jr. (at-large; 2018) and Andre Sayegh (Sixth Ward; 2020) and 
Luis Velez (Fifth Ward; 2020).[113][114][115][116][117] Paterson is located 
in the 9th Congressional District[118] and is part of New Jersey's 35th 
state legislative district.[10][119][120] Prior to the 2010 Census, Paterson 
had been part of the 8th Congressional District, a change made by the New 
Jersey Redistricting Commission that took effect in January 2013, based 
on the results of the November 2012 general elections.[121] New Jersey's 
Ninth Congressional District is represented by Bill Pascrell (D, Paterson).[122] 
New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Cory Booker (D, 
Newark, term ends 2021)[123] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 2019).[124][125] 
For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General Assembly), the 35th Legislative 
District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate 
by Nellie Pou (D, North Haledon) and in the General Assembly by Shavonda 
E. Sumter (D, Paterson) and Benjie E. Wimberly (D, Paterson).[126] The 
Governor of New Jersey is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[127] The 
Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[128] 
Passaic County is governed by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders, 
who are elected at-large to staggered three-year terms office on a partisan 
basis, with two or three seats coming up for election each year as part 
of the November general election in a three-year cycle. At a reorganization 
meeting held in January, the board selects a Director and Deputy Director 
from among its members to serve for a one-year term.[129] As of 2015[update], 
Passaic County's Freeholders are Freeholder Director Hector C. Lora (D, 
term ends December 31, 2015; Passaic),[130] Freeholder Deputy Director 
Bruce James (D, 2017; Clifton),[131] John W. Bartlett (D, 2015; Wayne),[132] 
Theodore O. Best, Jr. (D, 2017; Paterson),[133] Ronda Cotroneo (D, 2015; 
Ringwood),[134] Terry Duffy (D, 2016; West Milford),[135] and Pat Lepore 
(D, 2016; Woodland Park).[136][137][138] Constitutional officers elected 
on a countywide basis are County Clerk Kristin M. Corrado (R, 2019),[139] 
Sheriff Richard H. Berdnik (2016)[140] and Surrogate Bernice Toledo (2016).[141][142][143]

The City of Paterson is served by a professional police department.[153] 
The Paterson Fire Department, headed by Chief Michael Postorino, operates 
out of seven fire stations with a total of 400 employees, and is also responsible 
for the city's emergency medical services division and ambulance units.[154] 
The department is part of the Metro USAR Strike Team, which consists of 
nine North Jersey fire departments and other emergency services divisions 
working to address major emergency rescue situations.[155] In addition 
to local services, Paterson is home to the Passaic County Sheriff's Office 
Courts Division in the Passaic County Courthouse and Correctional Division 
in the Passaic County Jail. The jail, originally constructed in 1957, can 
accommodate 1,242 inmate beds.[156] In April 2011, Paterson laid off 125 
police officers, nearly 25% of the total force in the city, due to severe 
budget constraints caused by a $70 million deficit.[157] At the same time, 
the Guardian Angels, a New York City-based volunteer citizen safety patrol 
organization, began operating in Paterson at the invitation of the Mayor.[158] 
St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center is a large institution providing comprehensive 
emergency services as well as non-emergency medical care to Paterson and 
the surrounding community.[159] As of May 2010[update], the city had a 
total of 195.28 miles (314.27 km) of roadways, of which 157.62 miles (253.66 km) 
were maintained by the municipality, 29.21 miles (47.01 km) by Passaic 
County and 8.45 miles (13.60 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.[160] 
By road, Paterson is served directly by Interstate 80, as well as State 
Routes 4, 19, and 20, U.S. Route 46, and the Garden State Parkway. State 
Routes 3, 17, 21, and 208 are also nearby and serve as feeder roads to 
the community. Paterson also served as the terminus for numerous major 
secondary roads in northern New Jersey. Paterson Plank Road linked the 
city to Jersey City and eventually the Hudson River waterfront in Hoboken, 
while the Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike connected the city with Sussex County 
along what is now parts of State Route 23. The city is served by the New 
Jersey Transit Main Line commuter rail service, with the station located 
in Downtown Paterson. Plans are being developed for new commuter rail service 
on the existing NYS&W line, which is currently single-tracked. The Passaic-Bergen 
Rail Line plans to have five stops in Paterson.[161] Bus service to locations 
in Passaic, Bergen, Essex and Hudson counties is provided by New Jersey 
Transit, making the city a regional transit hub. The Broadway Bus Terminal, 
also downtown, is the terminus for many NJ Transit bus lines.[162] Service 
to and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan is offered 
on the 161 and the 190, by the 171 to the George Washington Bridge Bus 
Terminal in Washington Heights, Manhattan, on the 72 to Newark, with local 
service provided on the 74, 702, 703, 704, 707, 712, 722, 742 (Saturday 
only), 744, 746, 748, 770, 970 and 971 routes.[163][164] Many buses stop 
at or near City Hall, going to various points in the area, including New 
York and the neighboring communities. Private, independent jitney buses 
connect Paterson with neighboring towns, and provide transportation to 
and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan.[165] Service to 
the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal in Manhattan and shopping centers 
in Bergen County is also provided along Route 4 by independent jitney bus 
carriers (guaguas or dollar vans).[166] These buses run at high frequency 
but do not have formal, published schedules. The Paterson Public Schools 
serve students in pre-Kindergarten through twelfth grade. The district 
is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide,[167] which are now referred 
to as "SDA Districts" based on the requirement for the state to cover all 
costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under 
the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority.[168][169] 
As of the 2011-12 school year, the district's 48 schools had an enrollment 
of 24,365 students and 1,845.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for 
a student–teacher ratio of 13.21:1.[170] District enrollment in Paterson 
surged at the start of the 2015-16 school year, creating a public school 
enrollment of 700 students higher than expected and putting the school 
district in a situation of needing to hire teachers rapidly not long after 
the district had laid off 300 positions.[171] In 2011, all of Paterson's 
high schools were changed to theme schools, as part of a goal to give students 
a better choice in areas they wanted to pursue.[172] Among the 594 students 
who took the SAT in 2013, the mean combined score was 1120 and there were 
19 students (3.2% of those taking the exam) who achieved the combined score 
of 1550 that the College Board considers an indicator of college readiness, 
a decline from the 26 students (4.3%) who achieved the standard the previous 
year.[173] Paterson Charter School for Science and Technology is a charter 
school serving students in Kindergarten through twelfth grade.[174] Other 
charter schools include Community Charter School of Paterson (K-8), John 
P. Holland Charter School (K-8) and Paterson Arts and Science Charter School 
(K-7).[175] The city is host to the state's annual robotics competition 
held at Passaic County Community College. The competition, called the North 
Jersey Robotics Competition or NJRC, was created to place high educational 
merit on the students of Paterson. The competition draws schools from around 
New Jersey. Three events make up the meet which takes place on two different 
days. The competition's tenth anniversary event in 2011 was won by Paterson's 
Panther Academy. Blessed Sacrament School and St. Gerard Majella School 
are elementary schools that operate under the auspices of the Roman Catholic 
Diocese of Paterson.[176] In the face of declining enrollment and financial 
difficulties, Paterson Catholic High School, the city's last remaining 
Catholic high school, was closed by the Diocese of Paterson.[177] Established 
in the 1970s, Paterson hosts the main campus of Passaic County Community 
College, which serves 13,000 students at its main campus and at satellite 
programs in Passaic, Wanaque and at the Public Safety Academy.[178] Sister 
cities of Paterson include: There is a pact of friendship with the town 
of Montescaglioso (Matera, Basilicata, Italy) , as testified by mutual 
naming of two streets in their city centers. Paterson was a place of Italian 
emigration in the late nineteenth century and today houses a large community 
of citizens of Montescaglioso emigrated in those years.[184] The San Rocco 
Society was founded in Paterson, an association whose main purpose is to 
maintain sales relationships with the motherland, and in some ways the 
traditions.[187] Paterson is the subject of William Carlos Williams' five-book 
epic poem Paterson, a cornerstone work of modern American poetry.[1] Paterson 
is also mentioned in the twelfth line of Part 1 of Allen Ginsberg's poem 
Howl. In the novel On the Road by Ginsberg's friend Jack Kerouac, the protagonist 
Sal Paradise lives with his aunt in Paterson. Kerouac may have chosen Paterson 
as a stand-in for his hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts, also a mill town 
with a waterfall.[188] Paterson is the setting of many of Junot Diaz's 
short stories and novels, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Brief 
Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, and John Updike's 1997 novel In the Beauty 
of the Lilies.[189] The controversial arrest and conviction of boxer Rubin 
"Hurricane" Carter, whose conviction was overturned in 1985, was dramatized 
in the 1999 Denzel Washington film, The Hurricane, and was partially shot 
in the city.[1] The lyrics of the Bob Dylan song "Hurricane" include "In 
Paterson that's just the way things go / If you're Black you might as well 
not show / Up on the street / Unless you want to draw the heat". Lean On 
Me is based on events that occurred in Paterson's Eastside High School.[190] 
Alice, Sweet Alice (1976) with Brooke Shields was filmed entirely in Paterson, 
the director's hometown,[191] as was State Property.[192] Its sequel, State 
Property 2, and Far from Heaven, The Preacher's Wife[193] and Purple Rose 
of Cairo[194] are among other films that were partially shot in Paterson. 
The city was also a filming location for the 1995 drama film, New Jersey 
Drive, which is primarily based on Newark's automobile theft rate at the 
time, with the city being considered "the car theft capital of the world".[citation 
needed] The 2016 film Paterson directed by Jim Jarmusch is set in the city, 
about a bus driver also named Paterson who in his free time writes poetry 
for himself.[citation needed] Lou Costello often referred to his hometown 
of Paterson in his comedy routines with Bud Abbott. The plot of the June 
28, 1945, episode of the Abbott & Costello radio show is about the City 
of Paterson inviting him back for "Lou Costello Day" to launch a new garbage 
scow.[195] Paterson Falls was featured in the first season of The Sopranos 
in the episode Pax Soprana as the place where Junior Soprano's friend, 
Capri's grandson, committed suicide after taking poor designer drugs; As 
a favor, Junior Soprano had Mikey Palmice and another individual toss the 
dealer, Rusty Irish, over the falls.[196] Some interior shots for the show 
were filmed in the unused Barnert Hospital.[citation needed] The Sopranos 
also shot a scene at Ralph Piccolo Pizza and renamed it "UF-FA'S Pizzeria".[197] 
The New Jersey-based band Suit of Lights pays tribute to Paterson in their 
song, "Goodbye Silk City". The 1983 music video "Two Tribes" by Frankie 
Goes to Hollywood makes reference to Paterson in its opening sequence.[198][citation 
needed] The first marketable revolver was produced in Paterson by Samuel 
Colt starting in 1836, and was known as the Colt Paterson.[199] People 
who were born in, residents of, or otherwise closely associated with Paterson
