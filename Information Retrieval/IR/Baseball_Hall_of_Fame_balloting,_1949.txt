Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1949 followed the rules in place 
since 1947, which had governed two successful elections of recent players. 
The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select 
from players retired less than 25 years, with provision for a runoff in 
case of no winner. This year the runoff was necessary to elect one person, 
Charlie Gehringer. Meanwhile, the Old-Timers Committee, which met on no 
schedule and not since 1946, responded again to the continuing calls for 
election of more of the game's earlier stars. It selected Mordecai Brown 
and Kid Nichols. Induction ceremonies in Cooperstown on June 13 covered 
the elections of 1948 and 1949. The 10-year members of the BBWAA had the 
authority to select any players active in 1924 or later, provided they 
had not been active in 1948. Voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 
candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots 
would be honored with induction to the Hall. If no candidate received votes 
on 75% of the ballots, the top 20 candidates would advance to a runoff 
election. A total of 153 ballots were cast, with 1,409 individual votes 
for 98 specific candidates, an average of 9.21 per ballot; 115 votes were 
required for election. The results were announced in February 1949. For 
the first time in three elections following the most recent format change, 
no candidate received 75% of the vote, and a runoff was necessary. As had 
been true the previous year, a large number of players received votes, 
though few players were named who had not appeared in the 1948 vote apart 
from the newly eligible 1947 retirees (prominently, Mel Ott and Hank Greenberg); 
every still-eligible player who received more than 2 votes in 1948 was 
again named. 66 of those named received votes on less than 5% of the ballots, 
with 28 receiving only a single vote; every candidate had been eligible 
at some point in the past – for some, the 1936 election in which active 
players were eligible. Greenberg's eligibility was questioned by some voters, 
as he had been listed on the Cleveland Indians' active roster for part 
of the 1948 season as a precautionary move against injuries to other players. 
However, he was removed from the active roster once it became clear that 
his position as an Indians executive precluded any playing role, and he 
did not appear in any games; nonetheless, some voters maintained that his 
inclusion on the roster made him an active player and thus ineligible for 
election in 1949. Once again, the focus was now on the most recent players; 
those who had retired before 1932 receded even further in the voting. Only 
2 of the top 22 candidates, and none of the top 15, had retired before 
1932; 12 of the 20 players reaching the runoff had been active in 1941 
or later. Of the 98 players named, only 24 retired before 1930; they received 
only 9% of the vote. Three players who had retired before 1924 (none earlier 
than 1921) and were officially ineligible nevertheless received a single 
vote each; this was a notable reduction from the previous year's total 
of 23 votes for such now-ineligible candidates. Votes for those best known 
as managers again appeared, though only for those who were eligible as 
players and not to the same extent as in 1948, perhaps due to an expectation 
of more selections from the Old-Timers Committee. Chief Bender, who was 
technically eligible due to a single inning pitched in 1925, received only 
2 votes – a continued drop from his past prominence on the ballot; as with 
the previous election, it seems either that most voters were unaware of 
his eligibility or that they viewed it as irrelevant to the spirit of the 
rules. There was also some confusion as to the cutoff year for eligibility; 
some writers believed it to be 1927 or 1928 rather than 1924. Dizzy Dean, 
whose eligibility in 1948 had been questioned due to a single appearance 
in a 1947 game, returned to the same level he had attained in the 1947 
election. Unlike the 1948 election, no players active in the previous year 
received votes. The top 20 candidates, who had each received 20 or more 
votes, advanced to the runoff election; candidates who have since been 
selected in subsequent elections are indicated in italics: From the 20 
final candidates listed on the ballot, voters were instructed to cast votes 
for five; they were aware of the totals from the first election. Any candidates 
receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be elected and honored 
with induction to the Hall. A total of 187 ballots were cast, with 920 
individual votes for the 20 candidates, an average of 4.92 per ballot; 
141 votes were required for election. The results were announced on May 
5; exactly one player reached the threshold of 75% and was therefore elected. 
The more recent players once again figured more prominently in the voting, 
with the top 6 candidates retired less than 7 years. There was much criticism 
from those who disliked the runoff process, believing it amounted to two 
virtually identical elections in a row; with the candidates finishing in 
roughly the same order both times, many voters felt they were essentially 
being encouraged to vote for the top candidates from the first ballot in 
order to ensure at least one selection. As a result, the rules were again 
revised by the Hall of Fame Committee, and the runoff procedure was eliminated 
after 1949; it would not be reinstated until after the 1960 election. The 
induction ceremonies were held in Cooperstown on June 13, with Brooklyn 
Dodgers president Branch Rickey officiating. The two 1948 selectees being 
formally inducted as well; Pie Traynor was present. Charlie Gehringer, 
however, was unable to attend, as he was in California preparing for his 
wedding on June 18. The sole candidate who received at least 75% of the 
vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; all the remaining candidates 
have since been selected in subsequent elections, with 16 of the 20 chosen 
by 1956, and the last (Tony Lazzeri) in 1991: After not having voted on 
new inductees since 1946, the committee still did not meet formally to 
consider candidates; instead, the members cast ballots by mail on candidates 
from the pre-1924 era. This minor action temporarily decreased criticism 
that earlier players were being overlooked, but it would be the only attempt 
between 1946 and 1953 to elect players from this period, and there was 
no attempt to review managers and other non-playing candidates. On May 
9, it was announced that two pitchers had been selected: Nichols was still 
living, but Brown had died the previous year. They were formally inducted 
on June 13 along with Charlie Gehringer and the 1948 selections, Pie Traynor 
and the late Herb Pennock; Nichols and Traynor were in attendance. The 
selection of these two pitchers from the period between 1890 and 1916 was 
roundly applauded, but it was noted that stars of the earlier era had been
