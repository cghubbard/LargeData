Justin Brooks Verlander (born February 20, 1983) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He is currently the longest tenured player on the Tigers, and the only 
player left on the team from the 2006 American League Championship team. 
In 2006, Verlander was named the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year.[1] 
On June 12, 2007, he pitched a no-hitter—the first ever at Comerica Park—against 
the Milwaukee Brewers, striking out 12 batters and walking four.[2] He 
pitched a second no-hitter against the Toronto Blue Jays on May 7, 2011, 
in Toronto, walking one and facing the minimum 27 batters.[3] On November 
15, 2011, Verlander was named the 2011 AL Cy Young Award winner by a unanimous 
vote, becoming the first American League pitcher since Johan Santana in 
2006 to win the award in such a fashion. On November 21, 2011, Verlander 
was voted the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP), winning with 280 points over 
Jacoby Ellsbury's 242, completing a sweep of the Cy Young Award and MVP.[4] 
Verlander's father Richard sent him to The Richmond Baseball Academy. He 
was able to throw his fastball 84 mph (135 km/h) shortly after joining 
the academy. His velocity plateaued at 86 mph (138 km/h) during his senior 
year at Goochland High School, during which he was sidetracked by strep 
throat.[5] Verlander's velocity reached 87 mph (140 km/h) during his first 
year at Old Dominion. Verlander, a 6′ 5", 200 pound (1.96 m, 91 kg) right-handed 
pitcher, played for the Old Dominion University baseball team for three 
years. On May 17, 2002, he struck out a then-school record 17 batters against 
James Madison. In 2003, he set a school single-season record by recording 
139 strikeouts. In 2004, he broke his own record and established a new 
Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) record with 151 strikeouts. Verlander 
completed his career as the all-time strikeout leader in Old Dominion, 
the CAA and the Commonwealth of Virginia (Division I) history with 427 
in 335⅔ innings. During his three years, he averaged 11.5 strikeouts per 
nine innings and his career collegiate earned run average (ERA) was 2.57. 
Verlander pitched for the USA national baseball team in 2003 and helped 
the USA to a silver medal in the Pan American Games. He was named CAA Rookie 
of the Year in 2002 and earned All-CAA honors in 2003 and 2004. Verlander 
was named the ODU Alumni Association's Male Athlete of the Year in 2004, 
and was the second overall pick in the 2004 Major League Baseball draft 
by the Detroit Tigers. Verlander's professional baseball career began when 
the Detroit Tigers selected him second overall in the 2004 MLB Draft. He 
signed a contract on October 25, 2004. Verlander made his professional 
debut in 2005. He played for two of Detroit's minor league affiliates, 
the Lakeland Flying Tigers (A+) and the Erie SeaWolves (AA), and also started 
two games for the Tigers in July. After posting a 9–2 record and a 1.67 
ERA in 13 starts for Lakeland, Verlander joined the SeaWolves on June 20. 
On July 4, 2005, Verlander started against the Cleveland Indians and pitched 
5⅓ innings, gave up four runs and was credited with a loss. He also made 
a start against the Minnesota Twins 19 days later. Verlander lost both 
of his major league starts in 2005, but in seven starts with Erie, he was 
2–0 and his ERA was 0.28. Tightness in his right shoulder caused Verlander's 
season to end in early August when he was placed on the disabled list. 
Verlander was recognized as a Florida State League all–star, was a starting 
pitcher in the Futures Game and, according to Baseball America, was Detroit's 
highest rated prospect.[1] Verlander made his Major League debut on July 
4, 2005. He went 0–2 with a 7.15 ERA in his only 2 starts of the season. 
In his first full Major League season, Verlander went 17–9 with a 3.63 
ERA, striking out 124 batters in 186 innings. On July 4, 2006, at McAfee 
Coliseum in Oakland, California, Verlander, Joel Zumaya, and Fernando Rodney 
each threw multiple fastballs over 100 mph (160 km/h), becoming the first 
time in MLB history that three pitchers, on the same team, had done so 
during a game.[citation needed] He allowed one stolen base in 2006 and 
picked off seven baserunners. In 2006, he became the first rookie pitcher 
in the history of the game to win 10 games before the end of June and was 
named AL Rookie of the Year at the end of the season. During Game 1 of 
the 2006 World Series, Verlander was the Tigers starting pitcher against 
Anthony Reyes of the St. Louis Cardinals; it was the first instance in 
which two rookies faced off to start a World Series.[6] His success continued 
in 2007, as he accumulated 18 wins and posted a 3.66 ERA with 183 strikeouts 
in 201⅔ innings. On June 12, Verlander recorded a no-hitter against the 
Milwaukee Brewers, striking out 12 while throwing a fastball 102 mph (164 km/h). 
In 2008, Verlander lost four consecutive games before winning his first 
one. He led MLB in losses with 17. Overall, he finished the 2008 season 
with an 11–17 win–loss record and a 4.84 ERA. In 2009, Verlander finished 
with a 19–9 record, an ERA of 3.45 and an MLB-leading 269 strikeouts, the 
most by a Tiger since Mickey Lolich's 308 in 1971,[7] while his 10.1/9 
IP strikeout rate led all American League starters. His 19 wins led the 
majors this season. Verlander finished third in the AL Cy Young Award voting 
behind winner Zack Greinke and runner-up Félix Hernández. In the offseason, 
Verlander and the Tigers reached a deal for a five-year, $80 million contract 
extension.[8] On July 3, Verlander earned his 10th win of the season. This 
marked the fourth time in five years he has had double digit wins before 
the All-Star break. On September 18, Verlander beat the Chicago White Sox, 
throwing a complete game to earn his 17th win of the season. Verlander 
was the first pitcher to win 17 games in four of his first five seasons 
since Dwight Gooden.[9] He finished the 2010 season with an 18–9 record 
and a 3.37 ERA, while fanning 219 batters in 224 1⁄3 innings. On April 
22, Verlander recorded his 1,000th career strikeout in a 9–3 win over the 
White Sox, becoming the 15th Tiger to do so.[10] On May 7, he recorded 
his second career no-hitter against the Toronto Blue Jays, throwing four 
strikeouts, walking one batter and throwing at a maximum speed of 101 mph 
(163 km/h) on the radar gun. He carried a perfect game into the eighth 
inning before allowing a walk to J. P. Arencibia, who was the only Blue 
Jays batter to reach base in the game. Arencibia was erased on a double-play, 
so Verlander faced the minimum 27 batters for the game.[3] Verlander became 
the second Tigers pitcher since Virgil Trucks, and the 30th pitcher in 
the history of baseball, to throw multiple no-hitters. On his next start, 
against the Kansas City Royals on May 13, Verlander took a no-hitter into 
the sixth inning before surrendering a triple. Altogether, he pitched 15⅔ 
consecutive no-hit innings, spread over three starts. On June 14, Verlander 
took a no-hitter into the eighth inning. He pitched 7⅓ innings until he 
gave up a base hit to Cleveland's Orlando Cabrera. Verlander ended up with 
a complete game shutout allowing two hits. In his next start on June 19, 
he threw another complete game allowing a solo home run to Ty Wigginton.[11] 
On June 25, he recorded a career-high 14 strikeouts against Arizona.[12] 
Verlander was selected to his fourth AL All-Star team, but he was unable 
to participate in the game due to the scheduling of his starts. On July 
31, Verlander took a no-hitter into the eighth inning before surrendering 
a single to Maicer Izturis. He walked two and struck out nine. On August 
11, Verlander won his 100th major league game against the Cleveland Indians. 
A victory on August 27 made Verlander the first Tiger since Bill Gullickson 
in 1991 to win 20 games, and the first Major League pitcher since Curt 
Schilling in 2002 to reach 20 wins before the end of August.[13] By the 
end of the season, Verlander had won the Triple Crown of pitching in the 
AL, leading the league in wins (24), strikeouts (250; tied for sixth most 
in Tigers history) and ERA (2.40).[14] Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton 
Kershaw clinched the NL Triple Crown earlier in the week, making it the 
first since 1924 that a season featured a Triple Crown pitcher in both 
leagues. Verlander also led the AL in innings pitched (251) and win-loss 
percentage (.828; sixth-best in Tigers history).[15] Throughout the season, 
he never had an outing in which he threw fewer than six innings or 100 
pitches. Through 2011, Verlander had the best career strikeouts/9 innings 
percentage in Tigers history (8.3), and the second-best career win–loss 
percentage (.652; also the fourth-best percentage of all active pitchers).[15][16] 
In 2011, Verlander received the AL Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award, 
Sporting News Player of the Year Award, a Players Choice Award for Player 
the Year and Most Outstanding American League pitcher, and a USA Today 
American League Cy Young. Verlander was named the cover athlete of Major 
League Baseball 2K12.[17] Verlander won both the 2011 AL Cy Young Award 
and the AL MVP Award. He was the first pitcher to claim an AL MVP Award 
since Dennis Eckersley in 1992, the first starting pitcher to do so since 
Roger Clemens in 1986, and the third Tiger starter to do so in franchise 
history, joining Denny McLain (1968) and Hal Newhouser (1944, 1945). Verlander 
unanimously won the 2011 AL Cy Young Award,[18] but won the AL MVP in a 
much closer vote. Verlander edged out Boston's Jacoby Ellsbury, 280 points 
to 242 points, while collecting 13 of 28 first-place votes.[19] He became 
the first pitcher in baseball history to win the Rookie of the Year, Cy 
Young, and MVP awards in his career.[20] On May 18, Verlander took a no-hitter 
into the ninth inning against the Pittsburgh Pirates before giving up a 
one-out single in a 6–0 victory. It was his first career complete game 
one-hitter, his 16th complete game overall, and sixth career shutout. Verlander, 
who struck out 12 in the game, was hitting the upper-90s and 100 mph (160 km/h) 
into the eighth inning.[21] Verlander was named to the American League 
team roster and AL starting pitcher[22] in the All-Star Game. Verlander 
was joined by teammates Prince Fielder and Miguel Cabrera, the former voted 
as a starter.[23] At the All-Star break, Verlander had a 9–5 record and 
a 2.58 ERA in 18 games, and was leading the AL in innings pitched (132⅔), 
strikeouts (128) and complete games (five). In a forgettable All-Star game, 
he pitched one inning and gave up five runs. Verlander finished the 2012 
regular season with a 17–8 record. He ranked first in the American League 
in innings pitched ( 238 1⁄3), strikeouts (239) and complete games (six),[24] 
while also ranking second in ERA (2.64). In the 2012 ALDS against the Oakland 
Athletics, Verlander started Game 1 and won a 3–1 decision. In the deciding 
fifth game of the series, he pitched a complete-game shutout allowing four 
hits as the Tigers won 6–0 and advanced to the 2012 ALCS. The victory marked 
the first time in MLB history that a pitcher recorded more than 10 strikeouts 
in a winner-take-all postseason shutout.[25] Verlander's 22 strikeouts 
in the series set a record for an ALDS.[26] Verlander made his only appearance 
in the 2012 ALCS in Game 3 against the New York Yankees. He earned a 2–1 
win, blanking the Yankees hitters on two hits through eight innings (running 
his 2012 postseason scoreless streak to 24 innings) before surrendering 
a leadoff home run in the ninth inning to Eduardo Núñez. He pitched Game 
1 of the 2012 World Series against the San Francisco Giants and gave up 
five earned runs in four innings pitched, including giving up two home 
runs to eventual World Series MVP Pablo Sandoval. Verlander finished second 
to David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays in a close AL Cy Young Award race. 
Verlander collected 149 points (12 first-place votes) to Price's 153 points 
(13 first-place votes).[27] Verlander won (tie with David Price) his second 
consecutive AL Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award. Prior to the 2013 
season, Verlander and the Tigers reached an agreement on a seven-year, 
$180 million contract, with a $22 million vesting option for 2020 if he 
finishes in the top five in Cy Young Award voting in 2019. This contract 
made him the highest-paid pitcher in MLB history.[28] Verlander made his 
sixth-consecutive Opening Day start for the Tigers against the Minnesota 
Twins at Target Field in Minneapolis and won 4–2.[29] In a May 11 game 
against the Cleveland Indians, Verlander recorded his 1,500th career strikeout.[30] 
Verlander was selected as a reserve pitcher for the American League All-Star 
team by his manager, Jim Leyland, who managed the 2013 AL team. It was 
Verlander's sixth All-Star selection, but due to him starting a game on 
July 14 for the Tigers, he was declared unavailable for the July 16 All-Star 
game. Entering the All-Star break, Verlander had a 10–6 record, 125 strikeouts 
and a 3.50 ERA.[31] Verlander finished the 2013 regular season with a 13–12 
record, a 3.46 ERA, and 217 strikeouts. His 218 1⁄3 innings pitched were 
the lowest total since his 2008 season. In Game 2 of the 2013 ALDS, Verlander 
struck out 11 Oakland Athletics hitters in seven shutout innings. Verlander 
did not get the win as the Tigers lost the game, 1–0, in the bottom of 
the ninth inning. In Game 5 of the same series, Verlander pitched eight 
shutout innings with 10 strikeouts in a 3–0 victory, taking a no-hitter 
into the 7th inning. The win sent the Tigers to the American League Championship 
Series for the third consecutive year.[32] Verlander defeated the Athletics 
in Game 5 of the ALDS for the second straight season and is one of four 
starting pitchers in Major League history to have multiple wins in elimination 
postseason games, joining Bob Gibson, Chris Carpenter and Matt Cain.[33] 
Verlander has thrown 30 consecutive scoreless innings in the postseason 
against the Athletics, a major league record for a pitcher versus one team, 
surpassing Christy Mathewson's 28 scoreless innings against the Philadelphia 
Athletics from 1905–11. Verlander is the second pitcher in Major League 
history with 10 or more strikeouts and zero runs allowed in back-to-back 
postseason games, joining Sandy Koufax in Games 5 and 7 of the 1965 World 
Series.[33] In Game 3 of the ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, Verlander 
threw 6 1⁄3 scoreless innings (running his 2013 postseason scoreless streak 
to 21 1⁄3 innings) before surrendering a solo home run to Mike Napoli in 
the seventh. Despite giving up only that one run and striking out ten batters 
in eight innings, Verlander lost a 1–0 decision. The eventual World Series 
champ Red Sox eliminated the Tigers in six ALCS games. In the 2013 postseason, 
Verlander was 1–1 with a 0.39 ERA and 31 strikeouts in 23 postseason innings. 
The Tiger offense was shut out in two of his three starts. On January 9, 
2014, Verlander underwent core muscle surgery. The Tigers projected that 
Verlander might miss opening day in the aftermath of his surgery but he 
eventually recovered just in time for when pitchers and catchers reported 
to training camp in February, 2014.[34] On March 16, Tiger manager Brad 
Ausmus announced that Verlander would make his seventh consecutive opening-day 
start on March 31.[35] On April 12, Verlander got the first two hits of 
his major league career during a 6–2 road win over the San Diego Padres. 
This snapped a career 0-for-26 string.[36] Verlander struggled in the first 
half of 2014. His strikeouts were down to 6.8 per nine innings pitched, 
opposed to an average of 9.2 over the last five years.[37] His ERA and 
WHIP in the season's first half were also elevated to 4.71 and 1.49 respectively.[38] 
Verlander was not named to the AL All-Star team for the first time since 
2008, snapping a streak of five straight appearances.[39] On August 11, 
in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Verlander allowed five runs, 
four earned, on four hits in only one inning. Verlander left the game with 
right shoulder soreness, in his shortest outing of his career. His previous 
shortest outing was 1 1⁄3 innings in 2008.[40][41] Verlander would miss 
his next start, the first time that had occurred in his career. Justin 
fared somewhat better in the second half of 2014. His season ERA and WHIP 
dropped to 4.54 and 1.398, respectively. He won his final three decisions 
to finish with a 15–12 record, and the Tigers won the game in 6 of his 
last 8 starts.[42] Justin's strikeout rate remained low, however, as he 
finished with 159 strikeouts and a 6.9 K/9 IP rate, both the lowest since 
his 2006 rookie season. Verlander started the 2015 season on the disabled 
list due to a right triceps strain, ending his streak of seven consecutive 
opening day starts for the Tigers. This marks the first time Verlander 
has been placed on the DL in his career, following 298 career starts and 
1,978 innings pitched.[43][44] Verlander has thrown more pitches than any 
other pitcher since his rookie season in 2006, with 32,535 pitches in the 
regular season, and 1,688 pitches in the postseason.[45] On May 31, Verlander 
was sent to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens for a rehab assignment. It was 
his first time ever pitching for the Mud Hens, having gone straight from 
Double-A to the major leagues in 2005. He threw 79 pitches, 50 for strikes, 
allowing six hits and two walks in 2 2⁄3 innings.[46] He fared better in 
his second rehab start on June 6, lasting 5 2⁄3 innings and throwing 93 
pitches (69 for strikes). He gave up just one unearned run on four hits 
and no walks while striking out nine batters.[47] Verlander made his season 
debut with the Tigers on June 13 against the Cleveland Indians. He pitched 
five innings, giving up two runs on three hits and two walks, while striking 
out two. He left the game with a 3–2 lead, but got a no-decision as the 
Indians came back against the Tiger bullpen to win the game.[48] On August 
26, Verlander came within three outs of his third career no-hitter before 
allowing a double to Chris Iannetta, the first batter in the ninth inning. 
He finished the game with one hit, two walks, and nine strikeouts in a 
5–0 victory over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. This was his seventh 
career complete game shutout, and second career complete game one-hitter.[49] 
Verlander finished 2015 with a 5–8 record in 20 starts, but his other stats 
were a considerable improvement over the previous season. He had a 3.38 
ERA and 1.088 WHIP. His walk rate dropped to 2.2, while his strikeout rate 
inched back up to 7.6. On May 8, Verlander recorded his 1,981st strikeout 
in his Tiger career, surpassing Jack Morris for second place on the list 
of all-time Tiger strikeout leaders. He only trails Mickey Lolich, who 
had 2,679 strikeouts as a Tiger.[50][51] On May 18, Verlander fanned Eddie 
Rosario of the Twins for his 2,000th career strikeout, becoming just the 
second Tigers pitcher to reach the milestone, following Lolich.[52] Verlander 
went into the 2016 All-Star break with an 8–6 record, 4.07 ERA, 1.13 WHIP 
and 120 strikeouts in 117 1⁄3 innings (9.2 K/9). Verlander was named the 
American League Pitcher of the Month for July. Verlander was 4–0 with a 
1.69 ERA in six July starts, holding opposing hitters a .171 average and 
striking out 48 batters in 42 2⁄3 innings. Among qualifying starters in 
the AL (minimum 28.0 innings pitched), Verlander finished July first in 
strikeouts, tied for first in innings pitched, third in ERA and tied for 
third in wins. Verlander allowed just 26 hits in his 42 2⁄3 July innings, 
and had a 0.891 WHIP.[53] On September 27, Verlander struck out 12 Cleveland 
Indians batters to give him a career-high eight games this season in which 
he totaled 10 or more strikeouts.[54] Verlander was among the best starters 
in the majors after the 2016 All-Star Break. From July 15 on, Justin complied 
an 8-3 record, 1.96 ERA, 0.86 WHIP, and 134 strikeouts in 110 1⁄3 innings. 
In his three losses, the Tigers scored a total of two runs. Verlander finished 
the 2016 season with a 16–9 record, while recording 254 strikeouts to lead 
the American League for the fourth time in his career. He also finished 
first in the AL with a 1.00 WHIP, and his 3.04 ERA ranked second. His strikeout 
rate of 10.0 per 9 IP was the second best of his career, trailing only 
the 10.1/9 rate posted in 2009. Verlander joined Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens 
as the only three American League pitchers in history to strike out 250 
or more batters in a season after turning 33 years old. Verlander's 26 
quality starts were tied for the AL lead (with former Tiger Rick Porcello).[55] 
Following the season, Verlander was named a Gold Glove Award finalist at 
pitcher, along with R.A. Dickey and Dallas Keuchel. Verlander's five Defensive 
Runs Saved tied him for fourth among AL pitchers, as did his 29 assists. 
His 6.61 Wins Above Replacement (WAR) led all AL pitchers.[56] On November 
7, Verlander was announced by the BBWAA as a finalist for the American 
League Cy Young Award, along with Corey Kluber and Rick Porcello.[57] Also 
in 2016, Verlander won his third Tiger of the Year award, which was announced 
on November 10 by the Detroit Chapter of the BBWAA.[58] Verlander's younger 
brother, Ben Verlander, also plays for the Tigers organization as an outfielder. 
They played one game together during spring training.[59] Verlander started 
dating model-actress Kate Upton in late 2011, and in 2016 the couple got 
engaged.[60] In the 2014 iCloud leaks of celebrity photos, many of Verlander's 
personal pictures, which included nude pictures of both himself, Upton, 
and other women, were leaked online.[61] Verlander throws four above average 
pitches: a hard four-seam fastball anywhere from 92-97 mph on average (topping 
out at over 100 mph earlier in his career), a slider in the low-to-mid 
80s, a curveball at 78–81, and a circle changeup at 85–88 mph. Verlander 
tends to throw his slider only to right-handed hitters and his changeup 
only to left-handed hitters. He frequently uses his devastating 12–6 curveball 
with two strikes on the hitter.[62] Verlander is known for his unusual 
ability to "add" and "subtract" from his fastball velocity at any point 
in the game, giving him the ability to throw 100 mph or higher even in 
the late innings of games. This is despite the fact that he has thrown 
the most pitches in the major leagues since the beginning of the 2008 season.[63] 
Verlander's average fastball velocity with no strikes is 94.7 mph, while 
with two strikes it is 97.0 mph.[62] His power pitching frequently leads 
to high strikeout totals. In 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2016, he led the American 
League in strikeouts (leading all of major league baseball in 2009, 2011
