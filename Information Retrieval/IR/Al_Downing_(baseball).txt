Alphonso Erwin "Al" Downing (born June 28, 1941) is a former Major League 
Baseball pitcher. He was an All Star in 1967 and the NL Comeback Player 
of the Year in 1971. Downing is also famous for surrendering Hank Aaron's 
record breaking 715th home run on April 8, 1974.[1] Downing was born in 
Trenton, New Jersey. He attended Trenton Central High School, Muhlenberg 
College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and Rider College (now known as Rider 
University) in Lawrenceville, New Jersey.[2] Downing signed with the New 
York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1961, and was already on the major 
league roster by July of that season. In his first full major league season, 
1963, Downing went 13-5 with a 2.56 earned run average for a Yankee team 
that went 104-57, but were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1963 
World Series. In 1964, he went 13-8 with a 3.47 earned run average, and 
led the league with 217 strikeouts. Downing was 9-5 with a 2.66 ERA when 
he made his only All-Star team in 1967. He pitched two innings, giving 
up no earned runs while striking out two.[3] On August 11, he struck out 
three batters (Tony Horton, Don Demeter and Duke Sims) on nine pitches 
in the second inning of a 5-3 win over the Cleveland Indians.[4] Downing 
became the sixth American League pitcher and the 13th pitcher in Major 
League history to accomplish this feat. Injuries limited Downing to only 
twelve starts in 1968. In 1969, Yankees manager Ralph Houk began using 
Downing out of the bullpen more, as he made fifteen starts and fifteen 
relief appearances. He was traded to the Oakland Athletics prior to the 
1970 along with catcher Frank Fernández for Danny Cater and Ossie Chavarria. 
Downing's stay in Oakland was short lived, as he was dealt to the Milwaukee 
Brewers on June 11, 1970 with Tito Francona for Steve Hovley. Despite a 
respectable 3.34 ERA, Downing's record was 2-10 for a Brewers team that 
narrowly escaped losing 100 games (97). For the season, Downing went 5-13 
with a 3.52 ERA and 79 strikeouts in 27 games and 22 starts between his 
two teams. Prior to the start of the 1971 season, Downing was traded to 
the Los Angeles Dodgers for Andy Kosco. Downing turned things around in 
his first season in the National League, winning twenty games, including 
a league-leading five shutouts. He earned NL Comeback Player of the Year 
honors as well as finishing third in NL Cy Young Award balloting behind 
Hall of Famers Ferguson Jenkins and Tom Seaver. After giving up Hank Aaron's 
famous 715th home run on April 8, 1974, Downing made his third, and final 
post-season appearance that season. His Dodgers lost four games to one 
to the Oakland A's. Downing played two more full seasons with the Dodgers, 
and was released during the 1977 season with a 0-1 record and 6.75 ERA. 
Downing served as a color analyst on Dodgers cable-TV broadcasts from 1980–87 
and on Dodgers radio in 2005. He also broadcast for CBS Radio in the 1990s, 
and the Atlanta Braves in 2000. As of 2006, he remains on the Dodgers Speaker's
