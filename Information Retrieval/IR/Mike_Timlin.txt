Michael August Timlin (/ˈtɪmlɪn/; born March 10, 1966) is a former relief 
pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). Timlin played on four World Series 
championship teams in an 18-year career. Timlin was born in Midland, Texas 
to Jerome Francis Timlin Sr. and Nancy Sharon Beyer. Timlin graduated from 
Midland High School in Midland, Texas. He then attended and pitched at 
Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, where he was a member of 
Phi Delta Theta. Timlin was known for his 93 mph fastball.[citation needed] 
His sliders and sinkers had a downward break, inducing a significant number 
of ground balls. Timlin assisted on the final out of 1992 World Series 
in Game 6 by fielding a bunt by Atlanta Braves outfielder Otis Nixon and 
throwing to Joe Carter at first base. Timlin also recorded a save for the 
game. Joe Carter gave Timlin the game ball shortly after the play was made. 
Timlin did not allow a run during the 2003 postseason.[1] In 2004, Timlin 
made 76 pitching appearances, the third-most in Red Sox history and tied 
for fourth in American League history. On September 3, he made his 800th 
major league appearance, becoming only the 29th pitcher in major league 
history to reach that mark. Timlin made his 1,000th career appearance on 
August 31, 2007, against the Baltimore Orioles. Timlin's 2005 season exceeded 
expectations when he posted the best numbers of his career. In a career 
and Red Sox high, he made 81 appearances and he recorded a career-low 2.24 
ERA. Also worth noting, he allowed only two home runs in his 80 1⁄3 innings 
pitched. After his first three seasons with the Red Sox, Timlin struggled 
with injuries to his right shoulder and left oblique in 2006 and the beginning 
of 2007, making multiple visits to the disabled list. In the period after 
his return from the disabled list through July 23, 2007, Timlin recorded 
over 14 consecutive scoreless innings and appeared to have overcome any 
shoulder issues. Timlin appeared in the eighth inning of Game 1 of the 
2007 World Series, pitching one inning of scoreless relief. The appearance 
came 15 years to the day that Timlin closed out the final game of the 1992 
World Series As of 2007, Timlin was the only active player to have played 
on four non-New York Yankees championship teams: (the 1992 and 1993 Toronto 
Blue Jays and the 2004 and 2007 Boston Red Sox). On September 15, 2008, 
while playing the Tampa Bay Rays, Timlin set the record for most appearances 
by a right-handed relief pitcher with 1,050 games. He passed Kent Tekulve 
for first on the all-time list. In 2008, his ERA rose to a career-high 
5.66, giving up 1.6 home runs per 9 innings. As of the end of the 2008 
season, Timlin ranked seventh in appearances among all-time pitchers, with 
1,058 appearances. He was second among active pitchers, behind only Mike 
Stanton (1,178).[2] On April 19, 2009, Timlin was honored by the Red Sox. 
He threw out the ceremonial first pitch on "Mike Timlin Day" at Fenway 
Park. On July 29, 2009, Timlin signed a minor league contract with the 
Colorado Rockies and made a brief appearance for the Casper Ghosts in Casper, 
Wyoming for the Rockies rookie league affiliate. On August 15, 2009 Timlin 
was released by the Colorado Rockies, following which he retired from baseball. 
Alongside former teammates Johnny Damon and Édgar Rentería, Timlin made 
an appearance on the TV cartoon Arthur, providing his voice for the Elwood 
City Grebes pitcher "Winlin." He and his wife, Dawn, have two children, 
son Jake (born August 2, 1996) and daughter Mykala (born September 29,
