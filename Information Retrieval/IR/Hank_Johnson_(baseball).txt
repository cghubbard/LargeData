Henry Ward Johnson (May 21, 1906 – August 20, 1982) was a pitcher who played 
in Major League Baseball between the 1925 and 1939 seasons. Listed at 5 feet 
11 inches (1.80 m), 175 pounds (79 kg), Johnson batted and threw right-handed. 
He was born in Bradenton, Florida. Johnson entered the majors in 1925 with 
the New York Yankees, playing for them seven years (1925–26, 1928–32) before 
joining the Boston Red Sox (1933–35), Philadelphia Athletics (1936) and 
Cincinnati Reds (1939). He divided his playing time as a starter, middle 
reliever, and occasional closer during a career hampered by illness. His 
most productive years came with the Yankees, winning 14 games in 1928 and 
1930 and 13 in 1931. But he developed a chronic bursitis that eventually 
ended his career. In a 12-season career, Johnson posted a 63–56 record 
with 568 strikeouts and a 4.75 ERA in 249 appearances, including 116 starts, 
45 complete games, four shutouts, 11 saves and 1066⅓ innings of work. Johnson
