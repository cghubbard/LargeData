Woodrow Wilson Woolwine "Woody" Strode (July 25, 1914 – December 31, 1994) 
was an African American decathlete and football star who went on to become 
a film actor. He was nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Supporting 
Actor for his role in Spartacus in 1960. He served in the United States 
Army during World War II. Strode was born in Los Angeles, California. He 
attended Thomas Jefferson High School in South East Los Angeles and college 
at UCLA, where he was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. His world-class 
decathlon capabilities were spearheaded by a 50 ft (15 m) plus shot put 
(when the world record was 57 ft (17 m)) and a 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) high 
jump (the world record at time was 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)). Strode posed for 
a nude portrait, part of Hubert Stowitts's acclaimed exhibition of athletic 
portraits shown at the 1936 Berlin Olympics (although the inclusion of 
black and Jewish athletes caused the Nazis to close the exhibit).[1] Strode, 
Kenny Washington and Jackie Robinson starred on the 1939 UCLA Bruins football 
team, in which they made up three of the four backfield players.[2] Along 
with Ray Bartlett, there were four African-Americans playing for the Bruins, 
when only a few dozen at all played on other college football teams.[3] 
They played eventual conference and national champion Southern Cal to a 
0–0 tie with the 1940 Rose Bowl on the line. It was the first UCLA–USC 
rivalry football game with national implications. When World War II broke 
out, Strode was playing for the Hollywood Bears Football team but soon 
joined the United States Army Air Corps and spent the war unloading bombs 
in Guam and the Marianas, as well as playing on the Army football team 
at March Field in Riverside, California. After the war, he worked at serving 
subpoenas and escorting prisoners for the LA County District Attorney's 
Office before being signed, briefly, to the Los Angeles Rams along with 
Kenny Washington. They were the first African-American players to play 
in the NFL for many years. When out on the road with the team, Strode had 
his first experience with racism, something he wasn't aware of growing 
up in Los Angeles. "We were unconscious of color. We used to sit in the 
best seats at the Cocoanut Grove listening to Donald Novis sing. If someone 
said, "there's a Negro over there,' I was just as apt as anyone to turn 
around and say 'Where?' I had a black principal in my grammar school when 
I was a kid. On the Pacific Coast there wasn't anything we couldn't do. 
As we got out of the L.A. area we found these racial tensions. Hell, we 
thought we were white." Strode and fellow UCLA alumnus Kenny Washington 
were two of the first African-Americans to play in major college programs 
and later the modern National Football League, along with Marion Motley 
and Bill Willis, playing for the Los Angeles Rams in 1946. No black men 
had played in the NFL from 1933 to 1946.[4] UCLA teammate Jackie Robinson 
would go on to break the color barrier in Major League baseball (in fact, 
all three had played in the semi-professional Pacific Coast Professional 
Football League earlier in the decade). He played for two seasons with 
the Calgary Stampeders of the Western Interprovincial Football Union in 
Canada, where he was a member of Calgary's 1948 Grey Cup Championship team[5] 
before retiring due to injury in 1949. In 1941, Strode had dabbled for 
several months in professional wrestling.[6] Following the end of his football 
career in 1949, he returned to wrestling part-time between acting jobs 
until 1962, wrestling the likes of Gorgeous George.[7] In 1952, Strode 
wrestled almost every week from August 12, 1952 to December 10, 1952 in 
different cities in California. He was billed as the Pacific Coast Heavyweight 
Wrestling Champion and the Pacific Coast Negro Heavyweight Wrestling Champion 
in 1962.[8] He later teamed up with both Bobo Brazil and Bearcat Wright. 
As an actor, the 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) Strode was noted for film roles that 
contrasted with the stereotypes of the time. He is probably best remembered 
for his brief Golden Globe-nominated role in Spartacus (1960) as the Ethiopian 
gladiator Draba, in which he fights Kirk Douglas to the death. Strode made 
his first credited appearance in 1941 in Sundown, but became more active 
in the 1950s, eventually in roles of increasing depth. He played an African 
warrior in The Lion Hunters in Monogram's Bomba the Jungle Boy series in 
1951. Also, he appeared in several episodes of the 1952–1954 television 
series "Ramar of the Jungle", where he portrayed an African warrior. He 
played dual roles (billed as "Woodrow Strode") in The Ten Commandments 
(1956) as an Ethiopian king as well as a slave, and in 1959 portrayed the 
conflicted Private Franklin in Pork Chop Hill. He appeared once on Johnny 
Weismuller's 1955–1956 syndicated television series Jungle Jim. He became 
a close friend of director John Ford, who gave him the title role in Sergeant 
Rutledge (1960) as a member of the Ninth Cavalry falsely accused of rape 
and murder; he appeared in smaller roles in Ford's later films Two Rode 
Together (1961), The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962), and 7 Women (1966). 
Strode was very close to the director. During Ford's declining years, Strode 
once spent four months sleeping on the director's floor as his caretaker, 
and he was later present at Ford's death.[9] Strode played memorable villains 
opposite three screen Tarzans. In 1958, he appeared as Ramo opposite Gordon 
Scott in Tarzan's Fight for Life. In 1963, he was cast opposite Jock Mahoney's 
Tarzan as both the dying leader of an unnamed Asian country and that leader's 
unsavory brother, Khan, in Tarzan's Three Challenges. In the late 1960s, 
he appeared in several episodes of the Ron Ely Tarzan television series. 
Strode played the part of Binnaburra in "Incident of the Boomerang" on 
Rawhide in 1961. Strode's other television work included a role as the 
Grand Mogul in the Batman episodes "Marsha, Queen of Diamonds" and "Marsha's 
Scheme of Diamonds," appearing also in the third season of the Daniel Boone 
television series as the slave/wrestler Goliath in the episode of the same 
name.[10] Strode played a heroic sailor on a sinking ship in the 1960 film 
The Last Voyage. In 1966, he landed a major starring role as a soldier 
of fortune and expert archer in The Professionals, a major box-office success 
that established him as a recognizable star. Another notable part was as 
a gunslinger in the opening sequence of Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time 
in the West (1968); after this, he appeared in several other spaghetti 
Westerns of lesser quality. His starring role as a thinly-disguised Patrice 
Lumumba in Seduto alla sua destra (released in the U.S. as Black Jesus) 
garnered Strode a great deal of press at the time, but the film is largely 
forgotten now. He remained a visible character actor throughout the 1970s 
and 1980s in such films as Scream (1981), and has become widely regarded 
(along with Sidney Poitier and Brock Peters) as one of the most important 
black film actors of his time. His last film was The Quick and the Dead 
(1995), which starred Gene Hackman, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Russell Crowe. 
The closing credits dedicate the film to Strode. Strode was the son of 
a Creek-Blackfoot-black father and a black-Cherokee mother.[11] His first 
wife was Princess Luukialuana Kalaeloa (a.k.a. Luana Strode), a distant 
relative of Liliuokalani, the last queen of Hawaii. With her he had a son, 
Kalai, in 1946. They were married until her death in 1980.[12] In 1982, 
he wed Tina Tompson, and they remained married until his death. Strode 
was a dedicated martial artist under the direction of Frank Landers in 
the art of SeishinDo Kenpo.[13][14] Main character Sheriff Woody of the 
Toy Story animated movies by Pixar is named after Strode.[15] The recurring 
character of the Santa Barbara Coroner in the television series Psych was 
named after Strode. His son Kalai (a.k.a. Kalaeloa) Strode was a candidate 
in the 2010 special election for the 1st congressional district of Hawaii.[16] 
Kalai died of cancer on November 27, 2014 at the age of 67.[17][18] Strode 
died of lung cancer on December 31, 1994, in Glendora, California, aged 
80.[19] He is buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California.
