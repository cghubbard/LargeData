The 1977 Chicago Cubs season was the 106th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 102nd in the National League and the 62nd at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished fourth in the National League East with a record of 81–81, 20 
games behind the Philadelphia Phillies. On November 24, 1976, Bob Kennedy 
was named head of baseball operations for the Cubs. His first move was 
to inform Jim Marshall that he was fired as manager. Salty Saltwell‚ after 
a year as general manager‚ was named secretary and director of park operations. 
After Leo Durocher turned down an offer from Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley 
to manage the Cubs for the 1977 season, Herman Franks‚ who had briefly 
been a Cubs coach under Leo Durocher‚ was named the new manager.[1] In 
1977, the franchise experienced one of its biggest collapses. The Cubs 
hit a high-water mark on June 28 at 47-22 with an 8½-game National League 
East lead led by Bobby Murcer, who had 27 home runs and 89 RBI overall 
during the season, and Rick Reuschel, who had a record of 20-10. However, 
the Philadelphia Phillies cut the lead to two by the All-Star break, as 
the Cubs sat 19 games over .500, and the Cubs swooned late in the season, 
going 20-40 after July 31, finishing in fourth place at 81-81. On July 
28, with the Cubs down 14-10 in the eighth inning of a game against the 
Cincinnati Reds, the Cubs pinch-hit for both of their middle infielders, 
replacing shortstop Iván DeJesús with José Cardenal and second baseman 
Mick Kelleher with Greg Gross. The Cubs scored three runs, making the score 
14-13 going into the ninth inning. Since both replacements were typically 
outfielders, and the Cubs had just one player left on the bench who normally 
played middle infield to enter the game in the ninth inning, utilityman 
Dave Rosello, the Cubs allowed Cardenal to stay in the game and play second 
base while Rosello entered the game at shortstop. Rosello and Cardenal 
alternated between the two positions during the ninth inning depending 
on whether the batter was a left-handed or right-handed hitter. The Reds 
failed to score in the ninth, and the Cubs tied the game, forcing extra 
innings. At that point, the Cubs moved Cardenal to right field, and brought 
Bobby Murcer in to play the infield instead, continuing to flip-flop the 
positioning of Rosello and Murcer for the remainder of the game, which 
wound up going thirteen innings. In all, Rosello wound up switching positions 
twelve times, and Murcer eight times.[13][14] Infielders Coaches Note:
