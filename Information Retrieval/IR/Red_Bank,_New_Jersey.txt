Red Bank is a borough in Monmouth County, New Jersey, incorporated in 1908 
and located on the Navesink River, the area's original transportation route 
to the ocean and other ports. As of the 2010 United States Census, the 
borough had a population of 12,206,[9][10][11] reflecting an increase of 
362 (+3.1%) from the 11,844 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn 
increased by 1,208 (+11.4%) from the 10,636 counted in the 1990 Census.[20] 
Red Bank was originally formed as a town on March 17, 1870, from portions 
of Shrewsbury Township. On February 14, 1879, Red Bank became Shrewsbury 
City, a portion of Shrewsbury Township, but this only lasted until May 
15, 1879, when Red Bank regained its independence. On March 10, 1908, Red 
Bank was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature and 
was set off from Shrewsbury Township.[21][22] The borough was named for 
the red soil along the Navesink River.[23][24] Occupied by indigenous peoples 
for thousands of years, in historic times the area of modern-day Red Bank 
was the territory of the Algonquian-speaking Lenape Native Americans, also 
called the Delaware by the English. The Lenape lived in the area between 
the Navesink River and the Shrewsbury River in an area that they called 
Navarumsunk. The Native Americans traded freely with European settlers 
from England and the Dutch Republic in the mid-17th century, who purchased 
land in the area.[25] Originally part of "Shrewsbury Towne", Red Bank was 
named in 1736, when Thomas Morford sold Joseph French "a lot of over three 
acres on the west side of the highway that goes to the red bank."[26] Red 
Bank was settled by English colonists beginning in the 17th century and 
became a center for shipbuilding. Its population grew rapidly after 1809, 
when regularly scheduled passenger ships were established to serve the 
route to Manhattan.[25] By 1844, Red Bank had become a commercial and manufacturing 
center, focused on textiles, tanning, furs, and other goods for sale in 
Manhattan. With the dredging of the Navesink River about 1845, Red Bank 
became a port from which steamboats transported commuters to work in Manhattan. 
Red Bank grew in size as a result of this, as well as the effects of construction 
of a railway in the town by the Raritan and Delaware Bay Railroad in 1860.[27] 
During the 20th century, Red Bank was a strong cultural, economic, and 
political center in Monmouth County, until it was hindered by the economic 
recession that began in 1987. During this time, Red Bank's economy, based 
largely on retail commerce, was in decline, due to a real estate scandal. 
Local pundits and urban planners referred to the town as "Dead Bank".[28] 
Beginning in approximately 1991, under the New Jersey Development and Redevelopment 
Law, the borough authorized the creation of the Red Bank RiverCenter to 
manage redevelopment in what was designated as a special improvement district. 
RiverCenter retains authority over the management and redevelopment of 
a defined central business district, which includes Broad Street from the 
post office to Marine Park and from Maple Avenue to one block east of Broad 
Street. A number of urban redevelopment projects have taken place, including 
improved signage, distinctive and pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and lighting, 
a coherent design plan for Main Street and other major thoroughfares, improved 
condition of parking lots with landscaping, and similar projects.[29][30] 
The district as originally proposed was larger, to include the commercial 
areas west of Maple Avenue, including the antique buildings, The Galleria, 
and Shrewsbury Avenue. But, some property owners in this area were opposed 
to paying the special assessment. Plans for the larger district advanced 
but opposition became more rigorous. The proposed district was amended 
to exclude opponents, and the district that was adopted stops at Maple 
Avenue.[31] According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had 
a total area of 2.162 square miles (5.600 km2), including 1.739 square 
miles (4.504 km2) of land and 0.423 square miles (1.096 km2) of water (19.58%).[1][2] 
Red Bank is located on the southern bank of the Navesink River, in northern 
Monmouth County, New Jersey. It is about 24 miles (39 km) due south of 
the tip of Manhattan and about 25 nautical miles (46 km) to the tip of 
Manhattan if traveling by water along the Navesink River and through Raritan 
Bay. Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially 
or completely within the borough include Newmans Corner.[32] Red Bank is 
bordered by the Monmouth County municipalities of Middletown Township and 
the boroughs of Tinton Falls, Fair Haven, Shrewsbury, and Little Silver.[33]

is governed under the Borough form of New Jersey municipal government. 
The governing body consists of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising 
six council members, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan

with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.[7] 
The Borough form of government used by Red Bank, the most common system 
used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which 
council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at 
meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances 
subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The 
mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and 
most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of 
the council.[68][69] As of 2016[update], the Mayor of Red Bank is Democratic 
Pasquale Menna, whose term of office ends on December 31, 2018. Members
