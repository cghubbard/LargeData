Base runs (BsR) is a baseball statistic invented by sabermetrician David 
Smyth to estimate the number of runs a team "should have" scored given 
their component offensive statistics, as well as the number of runs a hitter 
or pitcher creates or allows. It measures essentially the same thing as 
Bill James' runs created, but as sabermetrician Tom M. Tango points out, 
base runs models the reality of the run-scoring process "significantly 
better than any other run estimator". Base runs has multiple variations, 
but all take the form[1] Smyth detailed the following forms of the statistic: 
The simplest, uses only the most common batting statistics[2] A = H + BB 
- HR B = (1.4 * TB - .6 * H - 3 * HR + .1 * BB) * 1.02 C = AB - H D = HR 
An offshoot includes significantly more batting statistics[3] A = H + BB 
+ HBP - HR - .5 * IBB B = (1.4 * TB - .6 * H - 3 * HR + .1 * (BB + HBP 
- IBB) + .9 * (SB - CS - GIDP)) * 1.1 C = AB - H + CS + GIDP D = HR A third 
formula uses pitching statistics[4] A = H + BB - HR B = (1.4 * (1.12 * 
H + 4 * HR) - .6 * H - 3 * HR + .1 * BB) * 1.1 C = 3 * IP D = HR Other 
sabermetricians have developed their own formulas using Smyth's general 
form, mainly by tinkering with the B factor. Because the base runs statistic 
attempts to model the team run scoring process, a formula cannot be applied 
directly to an individual player's statistics. Doing this would result 
in a run estimate for an entire team that puts out the individual's statistics. 
A workaround for this issue is to find the team's base runs with the player 
in the lineup and the team's base runs with a replacement level player 
in the lineup.[5] The difference between these values approximates the 
individual's base runs statistic. Base runs was primarily designed to provide 
an accurate model of the run scoring process at the Major League Baseball 
level, and it accomplishes that goal: in recent seasons, base runs has 
the lowest RMSE of any of the major run estimation methods. In addition, 
its accuracy holds up in even the most extreme of circumstances and leagues. 
For instance, when a solo home run is hit, base runs will correctly predict 
one run having been scored by the batting team. By contrast, when runs 
created assesses a solo HR, it predicts four runs to be scored; likewise, 
most linear weights-based formulas will predict a number close to 1.4 runs 
having been scored on a solo HR. This is because each of these models were 
developed to fit the sample of a 162-game MLB season; they work well when 
applied to that sample, of course, but are inaccurate when taken out of 
the environment for which they were designed. Base runs, on the other hand, 
can be applied to any sample at any level of baseball (provided it is possible 
to calculate the B multiplier), because it models the way the game of baseball 
operates, and not just for a 162-game season at the highest professional 
level. This means that base runs can be applied to high school or even 
little league statistics. From the TangoTiger wiki "Base runs adheres to 
more of the fundamental constraints on run scoring than most other run 
estimators, but it is by no means perfectly compliant. Some examples of 
shortcomings: One avenue for possible improvement in the model is the scoring 
rate estimator B/(B + C). There is no deep theory behind this construct--it 
was chosen because it worked empirically. It is possible that a better 
score rate estimator could be developed, although it would most likely
