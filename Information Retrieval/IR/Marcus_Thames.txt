As player As coach Marcus Markley Thames (/ˈtɪmz/ TIMZ)[1] (born March 
6, 1977) is the assistant hitting coach for the New York Yankees.[2] A 
former American professional baseball left fielder and designated hitter, 
he played for the New York Yankees, Texas Rangers, Detroit Tigers and Los 
Angeles Dodgers from 2002 through 2011. For his career, Thames averaged 
a home run every 15.9 at-bats[3] and holds the Tigers franchise record 
for average at-bats per home run, at 14.8.[4] He attended East Central 
Community College in Decatur, Mississippi. He was drafted by the New York 
Yankees in the 30th round of the 1996 Major League Baseball Draft. Thames 
warranted "prospect" status from the Yankees following a standout 2001 
season for the AA affiliate Norwich Navigators, in which he batted .321 
with 31 home runs and 97 runs batted in. For his efforts he was named to 
the Baseball America minor league all-star team.[5] On June 10, 2002, Thames 
began his major league career with a bang as he was the 80th player in 
history to hit a home run in his first at bat. Thames hit the home run 
off the first pitch he saw from Randy Johnson of the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
As his coaches and teammates were laughing in amazement, Thames stepped 
out of the dugout for a curtain call to a capacity crowd at Yankee Stadium.[6] 
On June 6, 2003, the Yankees (looking for a left-handed batter) traded 
Thames to the Texas Rangers for Rubén Sierra.[7] Thames hit a home run 
in his first at bat with the Rangers.[8] Thames was granted free-agency 
on October 15 and signed with the Detroit Tigers on December 7.[7] The 
next two seasons saw Thames splitting time between the Tigers and their 
AAA affiliate Toledo Mud Hens. While dominating the AAA level, he found 
it difficult to crack the outfield rotation in place with the parent club. 
However, in 2006 Thames made his first opening day roster with the blessing 
of new manager Jim Leyland.[9] Playing sparsely early in the season, he 
soon seized his opportunity for extended playing time due to injuries to 
Dmitri Young and Craig Monroe. Although he suffered through a slump near 
the end of the season, Thames was a key component to the Tigers vast improvement 
in the 2006 season. He set career highs in every offensive category, hitting 
.256 with 26 home runs and 60 RBIs in only 348 at-bats, finishing with 
a solid .882 OPS. Infamously nicknamed "Country Strong" by Tigers broadcaster 
Rod Allen. Thames spent a considerable amount of time during 2007 spring 
training learning the first base position, as Leyland sought ways to get 
Thames at-bats.[10] On July 1, 2007, Thames hit a solo home run in the 
bottom of the eighth inning to score the only run in the game in a victory 
over the Minnesota Twins. On July 6, he hit the third grand slam of his 
career at Comerica Park against the Boston Red Sox.[11] On July 8, Thames 
hit one of the longest home runs in the history of Comerica Park. Batting 
against pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka of the Red Sox, Thames hit a home run 
to deep center field that bounced off the camera area. The last Tiger to 
hit a home run to that area was Eric Munson in 2004. Thames hit eight home 
runs in seven consecutive games from June 11 to 17, 2008, becoming the 
first Tiger in team history to achieve that feat. During that streak, eight 
consecutive hits were home runs.[12] On August 9, 2009, Thames hit his 
100th career home run. He was released from the Tigers at the end of the 
season.[13] Thames signed a minor league deal to return to the Yankees 
on February 8, 2010.[14] His contract was purchased prior to the regular 
season, adding him to the Yankees' opening day roster.[15] Thames began 
the season platooning in left field with Brett Gardner, but was soon moved 
to a bench role because of his poor defense and Gardner's ability to hit 
left-handed pitchers. Thames would see more regular starts in left when 
Curtis Granderson was placed on the 15-day disabled list, as well as a 
few starts in right field when Nick Swisher was sidelined with an injury. 
However, in the latter part of the season, he rarely played the outfield, 
especially after the acquisition of Austin Kearns. He hit .288 with 12 
home runs in 82 games.[16] Although he usually only started against left-handed 
pitchers, Thames came through with several big hits in 2010. On May 17, 
he hit a walk-off home run against Red Sox closer Jonathan Papelbon. On 
July 4, Thames returned from a DL stint to hit a game-ending single against 
the Toronto Blue Jays. On August 11, he helped the Yankees come back from 
a five run deficit by hitting a home run in the eighth inning and a go 
ahead single in the ninth inning to beat the Rangers. In a six-game stretch 
from August 24 to 30, he had 6 home runs and 11 RBIs in 21 at-bats.[8] 
On July 29, 2010, Thames made his first career appearance at third base 
(minor leagues included) as a late-inning replacement. He committed a throwing 
error in his only chance.[17] During the 2010 ALCS, Thames served as the 
designated hitter when Lance Berkman took over first base and Mark Teixeira 
went on the disabled list with a hamstring injury. The Yankees lost the 
ALCS to the Texas Rangers in 6 games. Thames elected free agency from the 
Yankees on November 7, 2010.[18] Thames signed a one-year deal with the 
Los Angeles Dodgers for the 2011 season.[19] He made 70 appearances for 
the Dodgers before being designated for assignment on July 12. He had a 
.197 batting average for Los Angeles.[20] He was released a few days later. 
On July 22, 2011, the New York Yankees signed Thames to a minor league 
deal.[21] However, he never played in a game for the Yankees at any level 
of their system the rest of the season. On January 10, 2013, Thames was 
named the hitting coach of the Class A-Advanced Tampa Yankees.[22] For 
the 2014 season Marcus Thames was named the hitting coach of the New York 
Yankees Double-A affiliate the Trenton Thunder.[23] Top Yankees prospect 
Rob Refsnyder credited Thames with helping him rework his swing that allowed 
him to have his breakout 2014 season.[24] Thames was considered by the 
New York Yankees for their vacant hitting coach job and for a new role 
as assistant hitting coach prior to the 2015 season, but he ultimately 
was named hitting coach for the Yankees Triple-A affiliate the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
RailRiders.[25] After the 2015 season, the Yankees dismissed Jeff Pentland 
as their hitting coach, promoted Alan Cockrell, their assistant hitting 
coach, to replace him, and promoted Thames to the role of assistant hitting 
coach.[26] Thames's mother, Veterine, has been paralyzed since an auto 
accident when Marcus was five years old. As a result, she has only been 
able to watch him play in person a handful of times.[27] His nickname, 
"Slick", is the result of getting his hair cut too short when he was four 
years old.[28] Thames served in the National Guard from 1994 to 1998.[29]
