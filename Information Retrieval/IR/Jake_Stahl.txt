As player As manager Garland "Jake" Stahl (April 13, 1879 â€“ September 18, 
1922) was an American first baseman and manager in Major League Baseball

to the Senators, where he moved to first base full-time, with occasional

runs with 10 in 1910. He also struck out 128 times that year, a record 
that would stand until 1938. As a player-manager, he led the Senators to 
two seventh-place finishes, and in his second managerial stint led the 
Red Sox to the 1912 World Series title. His success was short-lived, as 
he had a falling-out with his teammates and resigned midway through the 
1913 season. His successor, Bill Carrigan, would win two more World Series 
titles for the Sox. Stahl died of tuberculosis in Monrovia, California
