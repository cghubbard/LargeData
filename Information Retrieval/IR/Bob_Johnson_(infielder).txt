Robert Wallace Johnson (born March 4, 1936 in Omaha, Nebraska), nicknamed 
"Rocky", is a retired American professional baseball player. Largely a 
utility infielder and pinch hitter, Johnson appeared in 11 Major League 
Baseball seasons, from 1960 until 1970. Johnson was a member of the 1966 
World Series champion Baltimore Orioles. He threw and batted right-handed, 
stood 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) tall, and weighed 175 lb (79 kg). Johnson played 
for seven teams during his 11-season MLB career — which began with the 
Kansas City Athletics and ended with the same franchise, when it was based 
in Oakland. He was a member of the expansion Washington Senators during 
their maiden season in the American League, then moved on to the Orioles, 
where he would play four full seasons and establish himself as a top pinch 
hitter. In 1964 he led the American League with 45 pinch hit at bats and 
15 pinch hits. Three years later, in 1967, Johnson collected 13 pinch hits 
in 34 at-bats in a season split between the Orioles and the National League's 
New York Mets.[1] Although Johnson's career batting average was only .272, 
he twice hit over .340 as a part-time player, for the 1967 Mets (.348) 
and the 1969 Athletics (.343). During the latter season, Johnson made 14 
pinch hits in 50 at bats, in a season divided between Oakland and the St. 
Louis Cardinals. In the field, Johnson played every infield position: shortstop 
(201 games), second base (167), third base (166) and first base (107).[2]
