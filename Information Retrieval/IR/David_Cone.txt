David Brian Cone (born January 2, 1963) is an American former Major League 
Baseball (MLB) pitcher, and current color commentator for the New York 
Yankees on the YES Network.[1] A third round draft pick of the Kansas City 
Royals in 1981 MLB, he made his MLB debut in 1986. During a 17-year baseball 
career, he pitched until 2003 for five different teams. Cone batted left-handed 
and threw right-handed. Cone pitched the sixteenth perfect game in baseball 
history in 1999. On the final game of the 1991 regular season, he struck 
out 19 batters, tied for second-most ever in a game. The 1994 Cy Young 
Award winner, he was a five-time All-Star and led the major leagues in 
strikeouts each season from 1990–92. A two-time 20 game-winner, he set 
the MLB record for most years between 20-win seasons with 10. He was a 
member of five World Series championship teams – 1992 with the Toronto 
Blue Jays and 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000 with the New York Yankees. His 
8–3 career postseason record came over 21 games and 111 innings pitched, 
with an earned run average (ERA) of 3.80; in World Series play, his ERA 
was 2.12.[2] Cone is the subject of the book, A Pitcher's Story: Innings 
With David Cone, by Roger Angell.[3] Cone was born in Kansas City, Missouri 
to Joan (née Curran) (1936-2016)[4] and Edwin Cone (b. 1934).[5] He attended 
Rockhurst High School, a Jesuit school, where he played quarterback on 
the football team, leading them to the district championship. He played 
summer ball in the Ban Johnson League. At 16, he reported to an invitation-only 
tryout at Royals Stadium and an open tryout for the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Upon graduation, he was drafted by his hometown Kansas City Royals in the 
third round of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft.[2] Cone went 22–7 
with a 2.21 earned run average in his first two professional seasons. He 
sat out 1983 with an injury, and went 8–12 with a 4.28 ERA for the Double-A 
Memphis Chicks when he returned in 1984. During his second season with 
the Class AAA Omaha Royals (1986), Cone was converted to a relief pitcher, 
and he made his Major League debut on June 8, 1986 in relief of reigning 
Cy Young Award winner Bret Saberhagen.[6] He made three more appearances 
out of the Royals' bullpen before returning to Omaha, where he went 8–4 
with a 2.79 ERA. He returned to Kansas City when rosters expanded that 
September. Prior to the 1987 season, Cone was traded with Chris Jelic to 
the New York Mets for Ed Hearn, Rick Anderson and Mauro Gozzo. Cone went 
5–6 with a 3.71 ERA and 68 strikeouts in 21 appearances (13 starts) his 
first season in New York City. Cone began the 1988 season in the bullpen, 
but was added to the starting rotation by the first week of May. His first 
start was a complete game shutout over the Atlanta Braves,[7] as he went 
9–2 with a 2.52 ERA in the first half of the season to earn his first All-Star 
nod. For the season, Cone went 20–3 with a 2.22 ERA to finish third in 
National League Cy Young Award balloting. The Mets ran away with the National 
League East by fifteen games over the Pittsburgh Pirates, and were heavy 
favorites over the Los Angeles Dodgers, against whom they had a 10–1 record 
during the regular season, in the 1988 National League Championship Series. 
Cone became a newspaper commentator on the playoffs for the New York Daily 
News, and incited controversy after the Mets' 3–2 victory in game one by 
saying Dodgers game one starter Orel Hershiser "was lucky for eight innings", 
and ripping closer Jay Howell:[8] After providing the Dodgers with bulletin 
board material, they jumped on Cone for five runs in two innings in the 
second game of the playoffs to tie the series at a game apiece.[9] After 
giving up the column,[10] Cone came back with a scoreless ninth inning 
in a game three Met win and a complete game victory in game six;[11] however, 
series MVP and 1988 Cy Young Award winner Orel Hershiser came back in game 
seven with the complete game shut out[12] to lead the Dodgers to the 1988 
World Series against the Oakland Athletics. Cone spent over five seasons 
in his first stint with the New York Mets, most of the time serving as 
the team's co-ace alongside Dwight Gooden while leading the National League 
in strikeouts in 1990 and 1991. In 1991, Cone switched from uniform number 
44 to 17 in honor of former teammate Keith Hernandez. On August 30, he 
struck out three batters on nine pitches in the fifth inning of a 3–2 win 
over the Cincinnati Reds. He became the 16th National League pitcher and 
the 25th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish the three-strikeout 
half-inning.[citation needed] Cone tied a National League record on October 
6, in the season finale, by striking out 19 rival Philadelphia Phillies 
batters in a 7–0, three-hit shutout at Philadelphia.[13] His 19 strikeouts 
was the second-highest total ever recorded in a nine inning game just behind 
the 20-strikeout games recorded by Kerry Wood, Roger Clemens (twice) and 
Randy Johnson, and tying Tom Seaver's single-game club record, making the 
Mets the only team with two pitchers to achieve the feat. Cone was the 
lone Mets representative at the 1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game,[14] 
going 9–4 with a 2.56 ERA at the All-Star break. With a 56–67 record, and 
fourteen games behind the first place Pirates, the infamous "worst team 
money could buy"[15] traded Cone to the Toronto Blue Jays for Jeff Kent 
and Ryan Thompson on August 27, 1992 after the non-waiver trading deadline.[16] 
With Toronto, Cone was 4–3 with a 2.55 ERA and 47 strikeouts. Combined 
with the 214 strikeouts he had with the Mets, his 261 strikeouts led the 
major leagues and were a career high. Cone headed to the post-season for 
the second time in his career as the Blue Jays won the American League 
East. The Jays defeated the Oakland Athletics in the 1992 American League 
Championship Series, and the Atlanta Braves in the World Series, to give 
Cone his first World Series ring, and become the first Canadian team to 
win the World Series. For his part, Cone went 1–1 with a 3.22 ERA in the 
post-season.[citation needed] Cone returned to his hometown Kansas City 
Royals as a free agent for the 1993 season.[17] Despite an 11–14 record, 
Cone had an impressive 1993, pitching 254 innings with a 3.33 ERA, or 138 
ERA+. He improved to go 16–5 with a 2.94 ERA (171 ERA+) in the strike-shortened 
1994 season to win the American League Cy Young Award, and finish ninth 
in MVP voting. Cone was a Major League Baseball Players Association representative 
in negotiations with Major League Baseball in events that surrounded the 
1994 baseball strike. Four days after the strike ended, the Royals traded 
Cone back to the Blue Jays for Chris Stynes, David Sinnes and Tony Medrano. 
Cone was 9–6 with a 3.38 ERA for Toronto, however, the Jays were 35–47 
and in fifth place when they struck a deal with the second place New York 
Yankees. On July 28, 1995, the Blue Jays sent Cone to the Yankees for Marty 
Janzen, Jason Jarvis and Mike Gordon.[citation needed] When the Yankees 
acquired Cone, they were on a six-game winning streak, though still trailing 
the Boston Red Sox for the division lead.[18][19] The Yankees won the wild 
card the first season of the new three division, wild card format. In his 
third post-season, Cone won the first game of the 1995 American League 
Division Series against the Seattle Mariners,[20] and left game five with 
the score tied at four. The Mariners won the game in extra innings to eliminate 
the Yankees from the playoffs.[21] The Yankees re-signed Cone in the offseason 
to a three-year contract worth $19.5 million.[22][23] Cone was 4–1 with 
a 2.02 ERA when he was diagnosed with an aneurysm in his arm in 1996 and 
went on the disabled list for the majority of the year.[24] In his comeback 
start that September against the Oakland Athletics, Cone pitched a no-hitter 
through seven innings before he had to leave due to pitch count restrictions.[19] 
Mariano Rivera allowed a single, ending the no-hit bid.[25] The Yankees 
returned to the post-season for the second of thirteen consecutive seasons. 
After losing to the Texas Rangers in game one of the 1996 American League 
Division Series,[26] and a no decision in the 1996 American League Championship 
Series,[27] Cone came back in game three of the World Series against the 
Atlanta Braves with a six inning, one run performance[28] to give the Yankees 
their first win of the Series on their way to their first World Championship 
in eighteen years.[29] Cone went 20–7 in 1998, setting a Major League record 
for the longest span between twenty win seasons.[19] Cone won the 1998 
American League Division Series clinching game against the Rangers, the 
1998 American League Championship Series clinching game against the Indians, 
and Game Three of the 1998 World Series against the San Diego Padres. Cone 
finished fourth in the AL Cy Young voting.[citation needed] He re-signed 
with the Yankees for the 1999 season for $8 million.[30] He went 12–9 in 
1999, pitching the sixteenth perfect game in baseball history on July 18 
against the Montreal Expos.[31][32] It is the last no-hitter to date by 
a Yankee, the only regular season interleague perfect game. Making the 
game even more remarkable was that it was "Yogi Berra Day" at Yankee Stadium. 
After a long feud with owner George Steinbrenner, Berra agreed to return 
to the stadium that day, and caught the ceremonial first pitch from fellow 
perfect game pitcher Don Larsen. Larsen could be seen smiling in the press 
box after the final out was recorded.[33][34][35] After the perfect game, 
he seemed to suddenly lose effectiveness. It was the last shutout he would 
throw in his career.[19][36] In 2000 he posted the worst record of his 
career, 4–14, while seeing his ERA balloon to 6.91, more than double his 
mark the previous year. In spite of his ineffectiveness, Cone was brought 
in during game four of the 2000 World Series to face the Mets' Mike Piazza, 
a controversial decision at the time — Denny Neagle had given up a home 
run to Piazza in his previous at-bat, but was pitching with a lead and 
only needed to retire Piazza to go the minimum five innings to be eligible 
for a win. Cone induced a pop-up to end the inning. It was the only batter 
he faced in the entire Series.[37][38] Cone recognized after the 2000 season 
that his tenure with the Yankees was over.[39] In 2001 Cone pitched for 
the rival Boston Red Sox, performing with mixed but mostly positive results, 
including a 9–7 win-loss record and a 4.31 ERA. His 2001 season included 
a suspenseful 1–0 loss against Yankees ace Mike Mussina wherein Cone pitched 
8 1⁄3 innings giving up one unearned run, keeping the game close even as 
Mike Mussina came within one strike of completing a perfect game, which 
would have made Cone the first pitcher to pitch a perfect game and be the 
losing pitcher in another.[citation needed] He sat out the 2002 season, 
but attempted a comeback in 2003. Cone went 1–3 in 4 starts for the Mets 
with a 6.50 ERA. He announced his retirement soon after his last appearance 
for the Mets on May 28, citing a chronic hip problem.[40] Upon retiring 
from baseball in 2001, Cone became a color commentator on the YES Network 
during its inaugural season. However, his comeback attempt with the crosstown 
rival Mets in 2003 infuriated Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and Cone 
was told he would not be welcomed back. After his second retirement, Cone 
was offered a broadcasting position with the Mets, but opted to remain 
home with his family. His wife, Lynn DiGioia Cone, an interior designer 
whom he married in 1994,[41] gave birth to a son, Brian, in 2006.[42] David 
and Lynn Cone later divorced. Cone married real estate agent Taja Abitbol; 
they live in Greenwich Village and have a son, Sammy, who was born on December 
15, 2011.[43] In 2008, Cone rejoined the YES Network as an analyst and 
host of Yankees on Deck. He left the YES Network during the 2009–10 offseason 
in order to "spend more time with my family". He was replaced by former 
Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez.[44] On April 19, 2011 Cone returned 
to the Yankees broadcast booth in Toronto, working as analyst for a Yankees-Blue 
Jays series along with Ken Singleton.[1] As an announcer, he is known for 
making references to sabermetric statistics, referencing some websites 
such as Fangraphs.com.[45] On July 17, 2009, Cone testified as a witness 
(representing the Democratic Party) before the Senate Judiciary Committee 
during the Supreme Court nomination hearings for Judge Sonia Sotomayor.[46] 
Cone read a prepared statement in support of Sotomayor's nomination which 
chronicled Major League Baseball's labor dispute of 1994 and the impact 
of the judge's decision which forced the disputants back to the bargaining 
table. Cone said, "It can be a good thing to have a judge in district court 
or a justice on the United States Supreme Court who recognizes that the 
law cannot always be separated from the realities involved in the disputes 
being decided."[47] His .606 won-lost percentage ranks 95th on MLB all-time 
list; 7.77 hits allowed per nine innings pitched ranks 60th on MLB's all-time 
list; 8.28 strikeouts per nine innings pitched ranks 17th; 2,668 strikeouts 
ranks 21st, and 419 games started ranks 97th on the MLB all-time list.
