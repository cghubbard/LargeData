Meredith Warrington "Spud" Murray[1] (October 28, 1928 â€“ September 15, 
2011[2]) was an American minor league baseball player and Major League 
Baseball (MLB) coach. Murray was the first full-time batting practice pitcher 
in Yankees history.[3] Murray attended Media High School, where he starred 
in baseball and basketball, ranking among the best players in Delaware 
County, Pennsylvania. He signed with the Cleveland Indians. However, an 
arm injury limited his playing career.[4] The Indians sold Murray to the 
independent Montgomery Rebels of the South Atlantic League in 1954.[5] 
Mayo Smith, the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies, hired Murray as his 
batting practice pitcher in 1958.[4] He joined the New York Yankees in 
the same role two years later.[1][4] Murray lived in Waterloo, Pennsylvania. 
He enjoyed hunting and fishing, often going fishing with Mickey Mantle
