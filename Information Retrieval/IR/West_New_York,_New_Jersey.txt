New York is one of the most densely populated municipalities in the United 
States as well as worldwide. West New York was incorporated as a town by 
an act of the New Jersey Legislature on July 8, 1898, replacing Union Township, 
based on the results of a referendum held three days earlier.[19][20] West 
New York underwent a massive growth at the beginning of the 20th century, 
driven by development of textile industries that made North Hudson the 
"Embroidery Capital of the United States".[21] The town was populated mainly 
with Italian Americans and German Americans.[22][23] The 1960s saw an influx 
of Cuban émigrés to the area,[24] once called Havana on the Hudson; it 
has since has become one of the United States cities with a majority Hispanic 
population. Simultaneously, high-rise apartments, some of the tallest buildings 
in North Hudson, were built along Boulevard East,[25][26] adding to the 
population of the town, giving it one of highest population densities in 
the country. Since the 1980s the Hudson waterfront, which had been part 
of the Weehawken Terminal has been redeveloped from industrial to residential 
and recreational uses, including the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway. According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the town had a total area of 1.329 
square miles (3.444 km2), including 1.007 square miles (2.609 km2) of land

area of West New York was Palisade Avenue. An influential citizen named 
Henry Kohlmeier who lived there objected to the noise created by horse-drawn 
public coaches, which led to the route being transferred one block west 
to what is now Bergenline Avenue (formerly Lewis Street), which runs parallel 
to Palisade Avenue, and which remains the city's main commercial thoroughfare. 
Currently the longest commercial avenue in the state, boasting over 300 
retail stores and restaurants, Bergenline runs through not only the entire 
length of West New York from north to south, but also through Union City, 
Guttenberg and North Bergen, making it the main commercial strip for North 
Hudson. Also known as the "Miracle Mile", Bergenline's largest concentration 
of retail and chain stores begins at the intersection of 32nd Street in 
Union City, and continues north until 92nd Street in North Bergen.[41] 
Bergenline Avenue is also used as the route for local parades, such as 
the annual Memorial Day Parade[42] Cuban Day Parade[43] and Dominican-American 
Parade.[44] In 1898, the Brooklyn Bridegrooms played two games at the West 
New York Field Club Grounds.[45] The New York Giants played one game at
