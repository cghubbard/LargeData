The Pittsburgh Pirates are members of Major League Baseball (MLB); they 
have employed sportscasters to provide play-by-play and color commentary 
during games broadcast over the radio and on television. On August 5, 1921, 
Pittsburgh hosted the first baseball game broadcast over the radio. Harold 
Arlin, a foreman at Westinghouse, announced the game over KDKA from a box 
seat next to the first base dugout at Forbes Field.[1][2][3] Throughout 
the 1920s and 1930s "occasional" games would be broadcast, until Rosey 
Rowswell became the first "Voice of the Pirates" in 1936.[4] While most 
of Roswell's early broadcasts were solo, he was joined by Pirates' co-owner 
Bing Crosby and his successor Bob Prince for games.[4] Prince took over 
as lead broadcaster in 1955 and held the position over the next 20 seasons. 
Prince gained a reputation for giving players nicknames and inventing catchphrases 
to describe the game; he was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of 
Fame and Museum in August 1986.[5] In 1976, Lanny Frattare became the Pirates' 
lead broadcaster. Frattare held the position for 33 years—the longest tenure 
of any Pirates' broadcaster.[6] Upon Frattare's retirement after the 2008 
season, Greg Brown took over the role as lead broadcaster.[7] Multiple 
people have held temporary positions as broadcasters, including former 
players Don Hoak, Dave Giusti, Willie Stargell, and Pittsburgh Penguins' 
broadcaster Mike Lange.[8] WWSW-FM broadcast Pirates' games on the radio 
during the 1940s and 1950s until KDKA became the franchise's flagship station 
in 1955.[9] In 2006, the Pirates switched to WPGB in an attempt to reach 
younger age brackets; under the contract WPGB carried Pirates' games though 
the 2011 season.[10] Starting with the 2012 season, KDKA-FM took over as 
the flagship station of the Pirates Radio Network. As of 2016, the Pirates 
Radio Network has stations located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio 
and Maryland. Go ball, get outta here! There are a reported 15,000 people 
at the game this afternoon. If that's true, then at least 12,000 of them
