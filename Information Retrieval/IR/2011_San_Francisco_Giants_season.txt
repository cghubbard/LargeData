The San Francisco Giants are an American baseball team. Their 2011 season 
marked their 129th year in Major League Baseball, their fifty-fourth year 
in San Francisco since their move from New York following the 1957 season, 
and their 12th in AT&T Park. They opened the 2011 season as the defending 
World Series champions on March 31, 2011. However, they were eliminated 
from post-season contention on September 24, 2011, finishing eight games 
behind that season's National League West champion Arizona Diamondbacks. 
Despite having the record of lowest runs scored of all time, they led the 
majors in 9th inning comebacks. Coming off the team's 2010 World Series 
success and his two-year, $22 million contract, Aubrey Huff arrived at 
2011 spring training out of shape.[1][2] His OPS dropped 215 points from 
the previous season to .676, last among Major League first baseman in 2011.[1][3][4] 
Well-intentioned fans sent him thongs throughout the season in hopes of 
improving his fortunes.[3] Huff was accountable for his struggles contributing 
to the team's failure to return to the playoffs in 2011.[1][2] † Shortened
