West Milford is a township in Passaic County, New Jersey, United States. 
As of the 2010 United States Census, the township's population was 25,850,[9][10][11] 
reflecting a decline of 560 (-2.1%) from the 26,410 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 980 (+3.9%) from the 25,430 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[19] West Milford started out as New Milford in what 
was then western Bergen County in the 18th century, having been settled 
by disenchanted Dutch from Milford, New Jersey (later renamed by the British 
as Newark). These same Dutch also built a town of New Milford in eastern 
Bergen County. When both New Milfords applied for post offices in 1828, 
a clerk in Washington, D.C. is said to have approved the other application 
first and assigned the name "West Milford" to the New Milford in western 
Bergen County in order to distinguish between the two locations.[20] West 
Milford became a municipality by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on 
March 10, 1834, when it was formed from the westernmost portions of both 
Franklin Township and Saddle River Township, while the area was still part 
of Bergen County. On February 7, 1837, Passaic County was created from 
portions of both Bergen County and Essex County, with West Milford as the 
western end of the newly formed county.[21] The township was named for 
Milford, Connecticut.[22] There are old name places in the township including 
Postville, Utterville, Corterville, Browns, Awosting, Echo Lake, Macopin, 
Charlottenburg (now under the Charlotteburg Reservoir, the community was 
named after King George III's wife, Queen Charlotte), Clinton (or sometimes 
called Clinton Furnace, now under the Clinton Reservoir, and the furnace 
still stands), Moe Mountain, Oak Ridge (a nameplace, but town is under 
the Oak Ridge Reservoir), Newfoundland, Apshawa, New City, and Smith Mills. 
Newfoundland is divided by the Pequannock River, which divides Passaic 
and Morris Counties; a small part of Newfoundland lies within Jefferson 
Township. A large part of the township, including the New City Village 
area, is reservoir property owned by the City of Newark in Essex County 
for its water supply. Prior to the Second World War, the township was a 
resort area with trains coming from New York City to stations at Charlotteburg, 
Newfoundland, Oak Ridge in the south and Hewitt (also known as Sterling 
Forest station) and Awosting in the north. Railroad service in the south 
was from the New Jersey Midland starting around the 1850s and in the north 
around the 1870s from the Montclair Railroad, out of Montclair, New Jersey 
and later the Erie Railroad (before their merger with the Lackawanna Railroad). 
Greenwood Lake is an interstate lake approximately 9 miles (14 km) long 
and covering 1,920 acres (780 ha), lying in both West Milford and Greenwood 
Lake, New York, across the New York state line. It was originally called 
Long Pond. It was dammed up to increase the size of the lake for water 
power down stream. During the resort era, several steamboats operated on 
the lake, the most famous and grand was the two deck steamer, Montclair. 
These steamboats met the trains and took passengers to the various resorts 
around the lake in both states.[23] There is a seaplane area on Greenwood 
Lake, a few large marinas and lakeside restaurants with docks. There is 
a public airport called Greenwood Lake Airport just south of the lake on 
top of a mountain ridge and has two landing strips; one is long enough 
to handle small jets.[24] There is one private airport in the township 
on a private estate. After World War II and for the next 20 years the area 
underwent a major change from a resort area to year round residences. Before 
there were year-round houses, the summer residence of Cecil B. Demille 
was West Milford. Road maps of the 1950s showing the population on the 
backside said 2,000 winter and 10,000 summer.[25] Jeremiah "Jerry" Goodfellow, 
a white German shepherd and the senior canine member of the New Jersey 
Search and Rescue was inducted into the Animal Hall of Fame in 2009.[26] 
Jerry lives with his owner and trainer, Sue Lavoie, on Union Valley Road 
in West Milford. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township 
had a total area of 80.316 square miles (208.018 km2), including 75.090 
square miles (194.483 km2) of land and 5.226 square miles (13.534 km2) 
of water (6.51%).[1][2] Unincorporated communities, localities and place 
names located partially or completely within the township include Apshawa, 
Awosting, Bearfort Waters, Beaver Pond, Boy Scout Lake, Browns, Buckabear 
Pond, Camp Rope, Cedar Pond, Charlotteburg, Clinton, Clinton Reservoir, 
Cooper, Dunker Pond, Echo Lake, Forest Hill Lake, Fox Island, Gordon Lakes, 
Green Valley Park, Greenwood Lake, Greenwood Lake Glens, Hacks Pond, Henion 
Pond, Hewitt, Himes Pond, Lake Lockover, Lakeside, Lindy Lake, Littletown, 
Lower Mt. Glen Lake, Macopin, Matthews Lake, Moe, Mount Laurel Lake, Newfoundland, 
Oak Ridge, Pettets Pond. Pine Crest Lake, Pinecliff Lake, Postville, Shady 
Lake, Smiths Mills, Surprise Lake, Terrace Pond, Upper Greenwood Lake, 
Upper Macopin, Upper Mt. Glen Lake, Uttertown, Vreeland Pond, West Milford 
Lakes, West Pond, Wonder Lake and Zeliff Pond.[27] The township borders 
the municipalities of Bloomingdale, Butler and Ringwood in Passaic County; 
Kinnelon in Morris County; and Warwick in Orange County, New York.[28] 
Portions of the township are owned by the City of Newark, Essex County, 
for its Pequannock River Watershed, which supplies water to the city from 
an area of 35,000 acres (14,000 ha) that also includes portions of Hardyston 
Township, Jefferson Township, Kinnelon, Rockaway Township and Vernon Township.[29][30] 
A small residential development known as "New City Village" or "New City 
Colony" was built on the property early in the 20th century to house workers 
of the Newark water supply system. It included a school and health facility. 
Proposed alternative uses for the village never materialized and the buildings 
were demolished after falling into disrepair. The land is still owned by 
the City of Newark.[31] Newfoundland is a neighborhood of West Milford 
located along the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway (NYS&W) tracks 
(freight service only) and Route 23. It is also a mailing address for Green 
Pond (just north of the Picatinny Arsenal in Rockaway Township, Morris 
County), a private lake community owned by Green Pond Corporation and Lake 
End Corporation, which lies in Rockaway Township where the Pequannock River 
divides Passaic County from Morris County. The 2003 film The Station Agent 
was set, and filmed, largely in Newfoundland.[32] There was an early silent 
movie produced in the township at the Mine Hole in the Hewitt section of 
the township. A still photo of that movie is published in the township's 
1984 sesquicentennial book entitled The Day the Earth Shook and the Sky 
Turned Red. At the 2010 United States Census, there were 25,850 people, 
9,625 households, and 7,084 families residing in the township. The population 
density was 344.3 per square mile (132.9/km2). There were 10,419 housing 
units at an average density of 138.8 per square mile (53.6/km2). The racial 
makeup of the township was 94.06% (24,315) White, 1.40% (362) Black or 
African American, 0.52% (134) Native American, 1.29% (334) Asian, 0.02% 
(4) Pacific Islander, 1.06% (273) from other races, and 1.66% (428) from 
two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 5.85% (1,512)

Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household 
income was $88,692 (with a margin of error of +/- $4,308) and the median 
family income was $102,410 (+/- $7,418). Males had a median income of $62,925 
(+/- $3,467) versus $45,449 (+/- $2,738) for females. The per capita income 
for the borough was $37,905 (+/- $2,289). About 1.7% of families and 3.1% 
of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.5% of those 
under age 18 and 5.2% of those age 65 or over.[45] Same-sex couples headed 
63 households in 2010, an increase from the 58 counted in 2000.[46] As 
of the 2000 United States Census[16] there were 16,029 people, 9,190 households, 
and 7,186 families residing in the township. The population density was 
350.1 people per square mile (135.2/km2). There were 9,909 housing units

had a female householder with no husband present, and 21.8% were non-families. 
16.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 5.5% had someone

were below the poverty line, including 6.1% of those under age 18 and 2.9% 
of those age 65 or over.[43][44] West Milford businesses are represented 
by the West Milford Chamber of Commerce, an organization of business men 
and women that has worked to improve and enhance the business community 
in West Milford since it was established in 1949.[47] For decades, West 
Milford was rural with only a couple of service stations, a couple of small 
eating establishments, and a bank or two. The community was mostly residential. 
In the mid-1960s a then-average-sized 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m2) A&P 
Supermarket was built. During the late 1990s, A&P closed this original 
store and built a 60,000-square-foot (5,600 m2) supermarket a few miles 
away from the town center, next door to their former store. In 2015, the 
supermarket shut down. In 1972, Warner Brothers opened up a wildlife theme 
park called Jungle Habitat. This park consisted of a drive through safari 
and a small park with various shows. Initially, this brought huge tourist 
revenue to the township. Shortly after the park opened, a tourist being 
driven through the safari in a taxi was attacked by a lion on October 19, 
1972, bringing negative publicity to the park.[48] The park was plagued 
by problems, including reports of dangerous animals escaping into West 
Milford.[49] Jungle Habitat was a mixed blessing due to the amount of summer 
and weekend traffic into this rural area made up of small two lane roads. 
Jungle Habitat wanted to expand and become a huge amusement park, but residents 
concerned with excessive traffic voted this proposal down in 1976, which 
resulted in an abrupt closing and exit. Some of the animals in the wildlife 
park were subsequently moved to the then-recently established drive through 
safari at Great Adventure in Jackson Township. The former site of Jungle 
Habitat, in recent years has become a location for various Township activities 
such as the annual Fourth of July Fireworks display. With the loss of tax 
revenue and the needs of the residents in mind, the township approved the 
addition of more businesses. In the 1970s,[citation needed] a 45,000-square-foot 
(4,200 m2) ShopRite supermarket was built, and was expanded in the mid-1980s. 
Shortly thereafter, other businesses opened in the West Milford Shopping 
Center. Near the ShopRite, several restaurants and fast food establishments 
were built, including a McDonald's restaurant as well as the Abby Theater, 
the first four-screen multiplex cinema in northern New Jersey. The Abby 
Theater was opened in 1976 and designed by Milton Herson for Music Makers 
Theaters, with a seating capacity of 1,400. The theater was named for Abby 
Leigh, wife of Mitch Leigh, then board chairman of Music Makers.[50] The 
Abby Theater closed down in 2009 after several unsuccessful business attempts, 
as the township did not have enough residents to keep the business in operation. 
It was slated to be demolished in order to make room for an expansion of 
the ShopRite supermarket in 2012.[51][52] In May 2009, Eden Farms, an 8-acre 
(3.2 ha) floral farm on Union Valley Road, became the first "preserved 
farm" in Passaic County. County officials used money from the Farmland 
Preservation Funds to purchase development rights to the farm.[53] Owners 
George and Diana Cluff initially began working on the agreement in 2007. 
The deal prevents the farm from being built upon.[54] West Milford sports 
are overseen by the township department of Community Services and Recreation. 
The township has individual organizations that run each youth sports program, 
including Little League Baseball (WMLL), Police Athletic League (PAL) Basketball, 
PAL Soccer, West Milford-Star Athletics Cheerleading, Midget Football Association 
(WMMFA) Football, WMMFA Cheerleading, Amateur Baseball Association (WMABA) 
Baseball, and Girls Softball Association softball (WMGSA).[55] The Township 
of West Milford operates under the Faulkner Act, formally known as the 
Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council-Administrator plan 
adopted as of January 1, 2004. This plan is described as a "Faulknerized" 
version of the borough form of government, which was added to the Faulkner 
Act as the fourth optional form of municipal government in 1981 by the 
New Jersey Legislature.[56] The voters of West Milford Township adopted 
the Mayor-Council-Administrator Plan at a special election held on December 
10, 2002,[57] making it one of only three municipalities that use this 
form.[58] Under the mayor-council-administrator plan, West Milford is governed 
by an elected mayor and council, with an appointed municipal administrator. 
The government consists of a Mayor and a Township Council made up of six 
council members, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis 
as part of the November general election. A Mayor is elected directly by 
the voters to a four-year term of office. The Township Council consists 
of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, 
with two seats coming up for election each year.[7] The Mayor holds executive 
power under the mayor-council-administrator plan and presides over meetings 
of the Township Council but does not vote except to break a tie. The Township 
Council enacts ordinances and resolutions, establishes policies, prepares 
the annual budget and levies taxes. The Township Administrator in the mayor-council-administrator 
plan oversees each of the departments established by ordinance and directs 
the business affairs of the Township.[59] As of 2016[update], the Mayor 
of West Milford Township is Democrat Bettina Bieri, whose term of office 
ends December 31, 2019.[3] Members of the Township Council are Council 
President Michele Dale (R, 2016), Ada Erik (R, 2017), Michael Hensley (R, 
2018), Marilyn Lichtenberg (R, 2017), Luciano "Lou" Signorino (R, 2016), 
and Tim Wagner (R, 2018).[60][61][62][63][64][65] West Milford is located 
in the 5th Congressional District[66] and is part of New Jersey's 26th 
state legislative district.[10][67][68] New Jersey's Fifth Congressional 
District is represented by Scott Garrett (R, Wantage Township).[69] New 
Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Cory Booker (D, Newark, 
term ends 2021)[70] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 2019).[71][72] For the 
2016–2017 session (Senate, General Assembly), the 26th Legislative District 
of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate by Joseph 
Pennacchio (R, Montville) and in the General Assembly by BettyLou DeCroce 
(R, Parsippany-Troy Hills) and Jay Webber (R, Morris Plains).[73] The Governor 
of New Jersey is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[74] The Lieutenant 
Governor of New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[75] Passaic 
County is governed by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders, who are 
elected at-large to staggered three-year terms office on a partisan basis, 
with two or three seats coming up for election each year as part of the 
November general election in a three-year cycle. At a reorganization meeting 
held in January, the board selects a Director and Deputy Director from 
among its members to serve for a one-year term.[76] As of 2015[update], 
Passaic County's Freeholders are Freeholder Director Hector C. Lora (D, 
term ends December 31, 2015; Passaic),[77] Freeholder Deputy Director Bruce 
James (D, 2017; Clifton),[78] John W. Bartlett (D, 2015; Wayne),[79] Theodore 
O. Best, Jr. (D, 2017; Paterson),[80] Ronda Cotroneo (D, 2015; Ringwood),[81] 
Terry Duffy (D, 2016; West Milford),[82] and Pat Lepore (D, 2016; Woodland 
Park).[83][84][85] Constitutional officers elected on a countywide basis 
are County Clerk Kristin M. Corrado (R, 2019),[86] Sheriff Richard H. Berdnik 
(2016)[87] and Surrogate Bernice Toledo (2016).[88][89][90] In 2004, the 
New Jersey Legislature passed the Highlands Water Protection and Planning 
Act, which regulates the New Jersey Highlands region. West Milford was 
included in the highlands preservation area and is subject to the rules 
of the act and the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council, a division 
of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.[91] All of the 
territory in the protected region is classified as being in the highlands 
preservation area, and thus subject to additional rules.[92] As of March 
23, 2011, there were a total of 17,588 registered voters in West Milford, 
of which 3,397 (19.3% vs. 31.0% countywide) were registered as Democrats, 
5,070 (28.8% vs. 18.7%) were registered as Republicans and 9,111 (51.8% 
vs. 50.3%) were registered as Unaffiliated. There were 10 voters registered

The West Milford Township Public Schools serve students in Kindergarten 
through twelfth grade. West Milford has six elementary schools (grades 
K-6), one middle school (grade 7-8), and one high school (grades 9-12). 
Further, the district supports a Center for Adult/Community Education. 
As of the 2011-12 school year, the district's eight schools had an enrollment 
of 3,782 students and 280.8 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a 
student–teacher ratio of 13.47:1.[102] The school system has 361 certified 
staff members, over 50% of whom have a master's degree or higher. Schools 
in the district (with 2011-12 enrollment data from the National Center 
for Education Statistics[103]) are the six K-6 elementary schools — Apshawa 
Elementary School[104] (269 students), Maple Road Elementary School[105] 
(325), Marshall Hill Elementary School[106] (314), Paradise Knoll Elementary 
School[107] (311), Upper Greenwood Lake Elementary School[108] (301) and

(626) for grades 7-8 and West Milford High School[111] (1,237) for grades 
9-12.[112][113] Our Lady Queen of Peace was a Catholic school located in 
the community of Hewitt until it was closed in June 2010 by the Roman Catholic 
Diocese of Paterson in the face of declining enrollment.[114] OLQP School 
celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009, and had its Fourth Grade teacher, 
Lorraine Ford, named as a finalist for the 2008 New Jersey Nonpublic School 
Teacher of the Year award.[115] The old Newfoundland, two-room schoolhouse 
was the Village Square Inn Restaurant until it closed in 2010. The old 
Hillcrest School is now the township's community center. The few one-room 
schoolhouses are all gone; the last one was the Hewitt School, destroyed 
by fire set by vandals (it had been the former Methodist church before 
a new, larger church was built). The New Jersey Midland Railway ran a trackage 
right-of-way through New Milford in 1872 developing the Newfoundland station, 
which[116]and later served passengers on the New York, Susquehanna and 
Western Railroad (NYS&W), which still serves freight along the line[117] 
As of May 2010[update], the township had a total of 198.30 miles (319.13 km) 
of roadways, of which 163.20 miles (262.64 km) were maintained by the municipality, 
26.61 miles (42.82 km) by Passaic County and 8.49 miles (13.66 km) by the

bus service between the township and the Port Authority Bus Terminal in 
Midtown Manhattan on the 194 and 196 routes, with seasonal service to Mountain 
Creek in Vernon Township on the 304 route.[119][120] The township provides 
its own bus service, on two routes. One that runs by Upper Greenwood Lake, 
and operates Monday-Friday, and one that runs between Oak Ridge & Newfoundland, 
which runs Wednesdays only.[121] People who were born in, residents of,
