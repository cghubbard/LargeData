Edward James Delahanty (October 30, 1867 – July 2, 1903), nicknamed "Big 
Ed", was a Major League Baseball player from 1888 to 1903 for the Philadelphia 
Phillies, Cleveland Infants and Washington Senators. He was known as one 
of the game's early power hitters, and while primarily a left fielder during 
his career, he also played as an infielder. Delahanty won a batting title, 
batted over .400 three times, and has the fifth-highest batting average 
in MLB history. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945. He 
died falling into Niagara Falls or the Niagara River after being kicked 
off of a train while intoxicated. His biographer argues that: A Cleveland, 
Ohio native nicknamed "Big Ed", Delahanty was an outfielder and powerful 
right-handed batter in the 1890s. Crazy Schmit, who pitched for the Giants 
and Orioles, said of him, "When you pitch to [Ed] Delahanty, you just want 
to shut your eyes, say a prayer and chuck the ball. The Lord only knows 
what'll happen after that." (quoted in Autumn Glory by Louis P. Masur) 
He attended Cleveland's Central High School and went on to college at St. Joseph's. 
Delahanty signed on to first play professional baseball with Mansfield 
of the Ohio State League in 1887.[2] Delahanty also played minor league 
ball in Wheeling, West Virginia. In 1887, the Wheeling team sold Delahanty 
to the Philadelphia Phillies for $1,900.[3] He became the most prominent 
member of the largest group of siblings ever to play in the major leagues: 
brothers Frank, Jim, Joe and Tom also spent time in the majors.[4] The 
Phillies obtained Delahanty as a replacement for Charlie Ferguson. Ferguson 
was a pitcher who had converted to second base for his final season, but 
he died early in 1888 from typhoid fever. Delahanty was brought in to fill 
in for him at second base.[5] He began his career on May 22, 1888, with 
the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League (NL), playing 74 games 
that season with a .228 average, 1 HR, and 31 RBI. The next year, in 56 
games, he raised his average to .293. In 1890 he jumped to the Players' 
League (PL), but returned to the Phillies the next year when that league 
folded. He hit .306 and tallied 6 HR and 91 RBI in 1892. During one game 
that season, St. Louis infielder George Pinkney charged toward home plate, 
expecting Delahanty to bunt; Delahanty swung and hit a ball that "appeared 
to have been shot from a cannon", breaking Pinkney's ankle.[6] That same 
year, Delahanty was the victim behind one of "The Most Shameful Home Runs 
of All Time", according to authors Bruce Nash and Allan Zullo. When Delahanty's 
Phillies hosted the Chicago White Stockings at Philadelphia's Huntingdon 
Street Grounds in July, Cap Anson hit a fly ball to center field. The ball 
hit a pole and landed right in the "doghouse", a little-known feature of 
the park that was used to store numbers for the manually run scoreboard. 
Delahanty tried reaching over the "doghouse" and then tried crawling down 
into it. He got stuck, and by the time teammate Sam Thompson had freed 
Delahanty from the area, Anson had crossed home plate. Delahanty blossomed 
in 1893 with .368, 19 HR and 146 RBI. He narrowly missed the Triple Crown, 
as teammates Billy Hamilton and Sam Thompson led the league in batting 
with .380 and .370 averages respectively. While with the Phillies, Delahanty 
played under manager Harry Wright, the man who assembled, managed, and 
played center field for baseball's first fully professional team, the 1869 
Cincinnati Red Stockings. Wright managed the Phillies with Delahanty for 
four seasons, from 1890 to 1893, with the two and their fine supporting 
cast leading the Phils to "first division" finishes during those years, 
though the team never won a pennant. Between 1894 and 1896 Delahanty compiled 
astonishing batting marks: .407, 4 HR, 131 RBI; .404, 11 HR, 106 RBI; .397, 
13 HR, 126 RBI. In 1894, despite his high average of .407, the batting 
title went to Hugh Duffy with a major league record-setting .440. The 1894 
Phillies outfield had a big season, with all four players averaging over 
.400. That season, Delahanty hit .407, Sam Thompson batted .407, Billy 
Hamilton .404 and spare outfielder Tuck Turner finished second to Hugh 
Duffy in hitting at .416. Delahanty won his first batting title in 1899 
with a .410 batting average, adding nine homers and 137 RBI and becoming 
the first player in major league history to hit .400 three times. Delahanty 
was surrounded by talent in the Philadelphia outfield. Author Bill James 
wrote, "Any way you cut it, the Phillies had the greatest outfield of the 
19th century."[7] On July 13, 1896, Delahanty became the second player 
to hit four home runs in a game. He was the only player ever to do so with 
four inside-the-park homers and the first one to do so in a losing effort. 
(The Phillies lost the game, 9–8.) In 1899, Delahanty hit four doubles 
in the same game. He remains the only man with a four-homer game and a 
four-double game. The same year Delahanty collected hits in 10 consecutive 
at bats. He tallied six-hit games in 1890 and 1894. After switching to 
the new American League (AL) in 1902, playing for the Washington Senators, 
Delahanty won his second batting title with a .376 mark. To date, he is 
the only man to win a batting title in both the AL and NL. After the 1902 
season, Delahanty commented to a reporter, "I know I am getting along in 
years and won't be able to last much longer in first-class baseball, therefore 
I am going to get all the money there is in sight... Last year I was playing 
with the Phillies for $3,000, this season the Washington Club gives me 
$4,000, and if I can get $5,000 no one can blame me for taking it."[8] 
Delahanty returned to the Senators for the 1903 season. He was hitting 
.333 with 1 HR and 21 RBI in 42 games that year until the incident at Niagara 
Falls.[4] Delahanty died when he was swept over Niagara Falls in early 
July 1903. He was apparently kicked off a train by the train's conductor 
for being drunk and disorderly. The conductor said Delahanty was brandishing 
a straight razor and threatening passengers after he consumed five whiskies.[9] 
After being kicked off the train, Delahanty started his way across the 
International Bridge connecting Buffalo, New York with Fort Erie (near 
Niagara Falls) and fell or jumped off the bridge (some accounts say Ed 
was yelling about death that night).[10] Whether "Big Ed" died from his 
plunge over the Falls or drowned on the way to the Falls is uncertain. 
His body was found at the bottom of Niagara Falls two weeks after his death. 
A study of the tragedy appeared with the publication of July 2, 1903: The 
Mysterious Death of Big Ed Delahanty, by Mike Sowell (New York, Toronto, 
MacMillan Publishing Co., 1992). Sowell presents the evidence of a drunken 
accident, suicide, and even possibly a robbery-murder (there were reports 
of a mysterious man following Delahanty). In his 16 seasons with Philadelphia, 
Cleveland and Washington, Delahanty batted .346, with 101 HRs and 1464 
RBIs, 522 doubles, 185 triples and 455 stolen bases. He also led the league 
in slugging average and runs batted in three times each, and batted over 
.400 three times. In the years since, Rogers Hornsby has been the only 
three-time .400-hitter in the National League (1922, 1924–25). Delahanty's 
lifetime batting average of .346 ranks fifth all-time behind Ty Cobb (.366), 
Rogers Hornsby (.359), Joe Jackson (.356). and Lefty O'Doul (.349). There 
is a sports bar in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, Delahanty's Tavern On The 
Square, named in his memory. His photograph and life story line the walls 
and menus inside. In 2008, he was memorialized by the band The Baseball 
Project on their album, Volume 1: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails. The song, 
"The Death of Big Ed Delahanty", is a driving, punk-influenced ballad.[11]
