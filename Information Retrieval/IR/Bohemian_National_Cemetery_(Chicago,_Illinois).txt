Bohemian National Cemetery (Czech: Český národní hřbitov) is a cemetery 
at 5255 North Pulaski Road on the north side of Chicago, Illinois. The 
cemetery was established by members of Chicago's Czech community in 1877.[2] 
The community had been outraged when a Czech Catholic woman named Marie 
Silhanek was denied burial at several Catholic cemeteries in Chicago because 
she supposedly never made her Easter Duty (going to confession and Holy 
Communion at least once during the Easter season), which is incumbent on 
all Catholics, even today.[3] In response, the Czechs purchased land in 
what was then Jefferson Township to create a cemetery that would be under 
their control.[4] The original plot of land was 50 acres (200,000 m2). 
Over the years, the cemetery expanded to 126 acres (0.51 km2).[5] The cemetery 
was notably featured in the 1998 film U.S. Marshals.[6] It was added to 
the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.[1] Bohemian National 
Cemetery is known for its limestone gatehouse[7] and its highly decorated 
columbarium niches, which contain photographs, artwork, flags, and other 
mementos of the individuals whose ashes are stored there.[2] Czech-American 
military veterans are honored through an American Civil War memorial, a 
Spanish–American War memorial, and a World Wars memorial, which were dedicated 
in 1889, 1926, and 1952, respectively.[2] The cemetery also boasts two 
sculptures by Albin Polasek, who headed the sculpture department at the 
Art Institute of Chicago. They are called Mother and Pilgrim.[8] In 2009, 
the cemetery added a columbarium specially dedicated to Chicago Cubs fans.[13] 
The structure is a replica of Wrigley Field's red brick wall, with a stained 
glass image of the stadium's scoreboard and a yellow 400 foot (120 m) marker. 
The wall contains 288 niches, and seats from Wrigley Field have been placed 
along its base. A Cubs fan named Dennis Mascari helped raise funds for 
the project in hopes of making visits to the cemetery less depressing. 
The cemetery agreed to let him build the columbarium on their grounds, 
but nixed a plan to broadcast Cubs games through a nearby speaker. The 
Cubs themselves were not directly involved with the project; Mascari worked 
with Eternal Images, which makes baseball-themed funerary products.[13]
