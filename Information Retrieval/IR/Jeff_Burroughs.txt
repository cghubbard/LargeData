Jeffrey Alan (Jeff) Burroughs (born March 7, 1951) is a former player in 
Major League Baseball. From 1970 through 1985, he played for the Washington 
Senators (1970–71), Texas Rangers (1972–76), Atlanta Braves (1977–80), 
Seattle Mariners (1981), Oakland Athletics (1982–84) and Toronto Blue Jays 
(1985). Burroughs batted and threw right-handed. He is the father of major 
league third baseman Sean Burroughs. In a 16-season career, Burroughs posted 
a .261 batting average with 240 home runs and 882 RBIs in 1689 games. Burroughs 
was selected by the Washington Senators with the first overall pick in 
the June 1969 draft. Late in the year, he joined the Senators at age of 
19. Considered a "good bat-no field" kind of player, Burroughs was a considerable 
slugging threat during his playing days. Defensively, he was capable but 
slow. In four full seasons with the Texas Rangers, Burroughs averaged 25.5 
home runs a year with a high of 30 homers in 1973. His most productive 
season came in 1974, when he batted .301 with 25 home runs and a league-leading 
and career-high 118 RBIs and was selected the American League MVP, making 
him one of only seven overall number-one picks to win the MVP title (the 
others are Chipper Jones, Alex Rodriguez, Ken Griffey, Jr., Bryce Harper, 
Joe Mauer and Josh Hamilton) and the first Ranger to win the award. During 
the 1974 season, Burroughs was at the center of the violent Ten Cent Beer 
Night debacle in Cleveland, where Burroughs was one of the targets of thrown 
objects and a few punches by unruly and inebriated Cleveland fans, in a 
game that was forfeited to Texas. Burroughs was selected an All-Star in 
both 1974 with the Rangers and 1978 as a member of the Atlanta Braves, 
when he entered the All-Star break with a National League-leading .324 
batting average. Burroughs was also named AL Player of the Year and selected 
as an OF on the AL All-Star team by The Sporting News his MVP season of 
1974. As a member of the Atlanta Braves, in 1977 Burroughs collected 114 
RBIs and hit 41 home runs, the latter number surpassed only by Cincinnati 
Reds outfielder George Foster (52). Burroughs had fans who maintained a 
large banner below the right field deck titled "Jeff's Jackpot", which 
displayed his home run total for the season plus one. Late in his career, 
Burroughs was still a valuable hitter, being used mainly as a DH and pinch 
hitter. After he retired, Burroughs later coached his son's Little League 
team, the Long Beach All-Stars; with Sean as their star player, these teams 
won the Little League World Series in both 1992 (they actually lost the 
championship game, but were later awarded the title by forfeit after their 
opponents were found to have used no fewer than 14 ineligible players)
