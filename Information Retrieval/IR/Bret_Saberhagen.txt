Bret William Saberhagen (/ˈseɪbərheɪɡᵻn/; born April 11, 1964) is an American 
former Major League Baseball right-handed starting pitcher. Saberhagen 
was born in Chicago Heights, Illinois. He attended Grover Cleveland High 
School, located in Reseda, California. Saberhagen starred in both basketball 
and baseball. In 1982, during his senior year, he pitched a no-hitter and 
was the winning pitcher in the Los Angeles City Championship game, played 
at Dodger Stadium.[1] Saberhagen was drafted out of high school by the 
Kansas City Royals in the 19th round of the 1982 Major League Baseball 
draft and made his major league debut on April 4, 1984. He made an immediate 
impact, compiling a 10–11 record and a 3.48 ERA. The Royals made the postseason 
but lost to the Detroit Tigers. Saberhagen pitched well in his first postseason 
start, giving up two runs in eight innings. In 1985, the 21-year-old Saberhagen 
established himself as the ace of the staff. He went 20–6 with a 2.87 ERA 
and won the American League Cy Young Award. He led the Royals to a World 
Series championship and was named MVP of the World Series, pitching two 
complete games, including a shutout in Game 7. He was also the subject 
of much media attention during the Series as his wife gave birth to his 
first son, Drew William, on the same night of the infamous Don Denkinger 
call. Saberhagen developed an odd pattern of successful seasons in odd-numbered 
years (1985, 1987, 1989, 1991) and poor performances in even-numbered years. 
In 1986, he was 7–12 with a 4.12 ERA. In 1987, another odd-numbered year, 
Saberhagen had an excellent year, going 18–10 with a 3.36 ERA. That record, 
however, was disappointing because Saberhagen had entered the All-Star 
break with a 15–3 record and another Cy Young Award seemingly in the bag. 
He pitched in the 1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, but he suffered 
a shoulder injury that hampered his second-half performance. In 1988, the 
pattern continued as Saberhagen went 14–16 for the Royals with a 3.80 ERA, 
the second most losses in the American League. The following year, 1989, 
he brought back his old brilliance by compiling a record of 23–6 with a 
2.16 ERA, leading both leagues with 12 complete games, and finishing third 
in strikeouts. Before his July 26, 1989 start against the Boston Red Sox, 
Saberhagen had a record of 9–5. Over the next two months, he compiled a 
record of 14–1 with four shutouts. Only once in a game over that period 
did a team score more than two runs. He also led the league in innings 
pitched, complete games, and strikeout to walk ratio. For his efforts, 
Saberhagen won his second Cy Young Award as the American League's best 
pitcher. Despite a 5–7 record, Saberhagen was selected to the 1990 American 
League All-Star team, primarily due to his 1989 performance. He rewarded 
the selection by being the winning pitcher in the 2–0 American League triumph. 
Saberhagen pitched only one game after the all-star break before being 
shelved for most of the rest of 1990 with an injury. In 1991, Saberhagen 
went 13–8 with a 3.07 ERA. On August 26, he no-hit the Chicago White Sox 
7-0 at Royals Stadium; to date, the no-hitter is the last thrown by a Royal.[2] 
On December 11, 1991, Saberhagen was traded along with Bill Pecota to the 
New York Mets in exchange for Kevin McReynolds, Gregg Jefferies, and Keith 
Miller. He posted several solid seasons, winning 14 games for the New York 
Mets in the strike-shortened 1994 season and won 15 games for the Boston 
Red Sox in 1998. Also in 1994, he had more wins than walks. No other pitcher 
(as of 2005) pitching more than 150 innings had accomplished this feat 
since 1919.[3] His stint with the Mets was not without controversy; on 
July 27, 1993, Saberhagen sprayed bleach into a group of reporters. After 
admitting his role in this incident, Saberhagen donated one day's pay to 
charity and apologized to fans and the media.[4] Bret appeared as himself 
in the 1994 Brendan Fraser movie The Scout. In the movie, he is hired by 
former NY Yankee's scout AL Percolo (Albert Brooks) to pitch to Al's phenom 
prospect Steve Nebraska (Brendan Fraser). Unfortunately for Bret's "character", 
Steve takes every pitch long. In 1995 he joined the Colorado Rockies as 
a much-heralded ace. While the Rockies made the playoffs as the National 
League Wild Card team, Saberhagen lost his only start, Game 4 of the NLDS 
when the Rockies were eliminated by the Braves on their way to a World 
Series win. Saberhagen didn't pitch at all in 1996 due to injury but attempted 
a comeback with the Boston Red Sox and went 15-8 and 10-6 in 1998 and 1999. 
He also won the Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year in 1998, and 
the Tony Conigliaro Award. After missing the entire 2000 season, Saberhagen 
attempted a comeback in 2001 but pitched in only three games. He retired 
at the end of the season. In 2005, he was inducted into the Kansas City 
Royals Hall of Fame. Saberhagen was eligible for the 2007 ballot for the 
Baseball Hall of Fame. He stated if he were voted in, he would not attend 
the ceremony because he believes Pete Rose should be inducted. Saberhagen 
finished with 7 votes and was not eligible for next year's ballot. He was 
a guest on an episode of Married... with Children. In 2006, he began coaching 
the Calabasas High School Coyotes Varsity baseball team, in Calabasas, 
California. He was a primary contributor to the building of a first-class 
baseball field for the Varsity team there. His younger son Dalton played 
on the Freshman team at that time and Saberhagen's goal was to coach his 
son when he moved up to Varsity. However, a constant set of battles with 
the Las Virgines Unified School District administration—among other reasons—caused 
him to resign his coaching duties in October 2007. Prior to the 2008 season, 
Saberhagen returned as the head coach of the Calabasas Varsity baseball 
team. He currently also resides in Thousand Oaks, California. Bret Saberhagen 
at one time opened and operated a sports entertainment facility featuring 
Major League-caliber indoor batting cages, pitching mounds, bowling, laser 
tag, and arcade games. The 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) sports center 
was located at 580 Montauk Highway in West Babylon, New York nearby Saberhagen's 
Babylon, New York estate. The facility's façade was shaped like Ebbets 
Field, the storied home of the Brooklyn Dodgers and designed by Steven
