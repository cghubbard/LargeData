Humboldt is a city in Allen County, Kansas, United States. It is situated 
along the Neosho River. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 
1,953.[6] Humboldt, named after Baron von Humboldt, was founded in 1857.[7] 
Germans migrating from Hartford, Connecticut, began organizing a colony 
during the winter of 1856–57. They arrived in Lawrence, Kansas, in March 
1857, and at the townsite on May 10, 1857. Orlin Thurston, a young attorney, 
moved to Humboldt during the summer of 1857 and put up a steam sawmill; 
he began sawing wood and building houses on the prairie side of town. The 
first frame building was erected by J.A. Coffey; and in May 1858, W.C. 
O'Brien opened the first gristmill in the county. The United Brethren Denomination 
erected the first church in 1859.[8] In 1861 Humboldt was attacked by a 
collection of border ruffians and Osages led by John Mathews out of Oswego, 
Kansas who took several recently freed African-Americans back into captivity. 
The Humboldt Home Guard joined with the Kansas 6th Cavalry under James 
G. Blunt to counter-attack. In a battle on September. 18, 1861 Mathews 
was killed at Chetopa, Kansas. The city was organized as a village in 1866 
and incorporated as a city of the second class by the act of February 28, 
1870. In October 1870 the Leavenworth, Lawrence & Galveston railway was 
run through Humboldt;[9] the railway is currently a short line owned by 
BNSF Railway. Humboldt was the Allen county seat for seven years, from 
1858 until 1865, when Iola became the seat. Humboldt won two contentious 
legislative elections to become the seat in 1858 and 1860, but another 
election in 1865 at the end of the American Civil War resulted in the re-location 
of the county seat to Iola. The legitimacy of this election was questioned 
by Humboldt residents due to low turnout arising from soldiers fighting 
the War. Some residents claim that the county seat was "stolen". Iola effectively 
secured the seat by donating 100 lots to the county to aid in the construction 
of public buildings and subsequently raising funds to build a courthouse.[citation 
needed] However, Humboldt was also guilty of shady practices. Lieut. Col. 
Charles W. Blair, the commander of Fort Scott, temporarily replaced the 
commander of the post at Humboldt, Maj. Henry C. Haas, to keep the soldiers 
there from illegally voting in the county seat election. Blair claimed 
none of the troops were legal voters in Humboldt. The Humboldt newspaper, 
however, denied the troops had been involved in any wrongdoing. County 
seat wars of this sort were common in Kansas and the American West.[10][11] 
Humboldt was very much involved in the American Civil War. The town was 
raided September 1, 1861, by Confederate raiders, who took much property 
and kidnapped eight free blacks, who may have been placed into slavery. 
Several persons may have been wounded by gunfire, but no one was killed. 
Many of the raiders were hunted down and one of the leaders, Col. John 
Mathews, was killed.[12] Actions were taken to prevent Humboldt coming 
under further attack. Two home guard companies were organized in the Humboldt 
area. These militia units sought to protect the town and to scout as far 
south as the Kansas-Indian Territory border to prevent Confederates from 
coming too close to town. Some of the militia were involved with the pursuit 
of the September raiders. Two Humboldt area structures, O'Brien's Mill 
and W. W. Curdy dry goods store, were fortified.[13][14][15] Amazingly, 
Humboldt fell victim to another raid on October 14, 1861, 1 1/2 months 
after the first raid. The second raid caught the town totally off guard 
and the 100 home guards surrendered when they discovered they could not 
protect the town from the 330 raiders. O'Brien's Mill and most of the town 
was burned. The W. W. Curdy store apparently was spared, but it played 
no further role in Humboldt's defenses. It was said the second raid was 
at least in part revenge for the killing of Mathews and for the actions 
of U.S. Senator James H. Lane and his brigade's sacking and destruction 
of Osceola, Missouri.[16][17] After the second raid the threats to Humboldt's 
safety were taken very seriously. At times the town had local militia units 
operating and most of the rest of the Civil War the town had Army troops 
stationed there. Sometimes the military post there was called Post Humboldt. 
A blockhouse was partially constructed at 514 S. 3rd Street. This was used 
by the local militia as its headquarters and as a recruiting office.[18][19] 
Other points in town were used by the military. The German settlers in 
town built a church on Bridge Street, in the east part of town. This was 
used as the post's quartermaster store and was run by a sergeant. On the 
west side of town, a number of cabins were built on the east side of the 
Neosho River. This was sometimes called Log Town, but was more commonly 
known as Camp Hunter. When the ranks swelled beyond the capacity of the 
cabins, tents were pitched at the camp. Of the places used by the military, 
home guards and militia, today only the German church stands and it was 
converted into a private residence in the 1950s. The geographic coordinates 
of the various points are: In October 1864, the area was threatened by 
a huge raid through Missouri and eastern Kansas. The Confederate raiders 
were commanded by Maj. Gen. Sterling Price and most of the troops and militia 
went to meet the threat further east. Also, in the same time period Maj. 
Haas, in command of the troops, and Maj. Watson Stewart, in command of 
the militia had differences of opinion as to the extent of the jurisdiction 
of Haas. Haas wanted control of the militia and Stewart contested this. 
The militia maintained its independence, but no until Haas managed to arrest 
one of the militia's officers.[20][21] The post at Humboldt was manned 
by troops at least through June 1865. It probably lasted into July and 
very possibly into August. When troops abandoned the town, the use of the 
military buildings came to an end, as well.[22][23] Humboldt is located 
at 37°48′39″N 95°26′15″W﻿ / ﻿37.81083°N 95.43750°W﻿ / 37.81083; -95.43750

the Neosho River, midway between Iola (to the north) and Chanute (to the 
south, in Neosho County) along Old 169 Highway. The old highway passes 
through the center of town, while the current U.S. Route 169 passes by 
at about a mile to the east. A short line for BNSF Railway passes along 
the eastern side of town and terminates in Iola. Allen County Airport is 
located only a few miles to the northeast. According to the United States 
Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.45 square miles (3.76 km2), 
of which, 1.44 square miles (3.73 km2) is land and 0.01 square miles (0.03 km2) 
is water.[1] The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers 
and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification 
system, Humboldt has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated "Cfa" on 
climate maps.[25] As of the census[2] of 2010, there were 1,953 people,

and bean feed.[27] The Humboldt school district (USD 258), with three schools,
