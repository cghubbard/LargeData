Braintree (US pronunciation: /ˌbreɪnˈtriː/[citation needed]), officially 
the Town of Braintree, is a suburban New England city in Norfolk County, 
Massachusetts, United States. Although officially known as a town, Braintree 
adopted a municipal charter, effective 2008, with a mayor-council form 
of government and is considered a city under Massachusetts law.[5] The 
population was 35,744 at the 2010 census.[1] The town is part of the Greater 
Boston area with access to the MBTA Red Line and is a member of the Metropolitan 
Area Planning Commission's South Shore Coalition.[6] The first and current 
mayor of Braintree is Joe Sullivan.[7][8] Braintree, Massachusetts is named 
after Braintree, Essex in England. The town of Braintree was settled in 
1625,[2] colonized in 1635 and incorporated in 1640[4] and named after 
the English town of Braintree. It comprised land that was later split into 
Quincy (incorporated in 1792), Randolph (1793), and Holbrook (1872).[9] 
Braintree was part of Suffolk County until the formation of Norfolk County 
in 1793.[10] The town of Braintree was the birthplace of presidents John 
Adams and John Quincy Adams, as well as statesman John Hancock. General 
Sylvanus Thayer, the "Father of West Point" was also born in Braintree, 
in the section of town now known as Braintree Highlands. Braintree was 
the site of the infamous 1920 murders that led to the trial of Sacco and 
Vanzetti. It was the retirement home of the co-inventor of the telephone, 
Thomas A. Watson. Braintree's population grew by over 50% during the 1920s.[11] 
In January 2008, Braintree converted from a representative town meeting 
form of government to a mayor-council government. Braintree shares borders 
with Quincy to the north, Randolph to the west (separated by the Cochato 
River), Holbrook to the south, and Weymouth to the east. According to the 
United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 14.5 square miles 
(37.6 km²), of which 13.9 square miles (36.0 km²) is land and 0.6 sq mi 
(1.6 km²) is water. The total area is 4.34% water Park and recreation locations 
in Braintree include Pond Meadow Park, Sunset Lake, and Blue Hills Reservation. 
Braintree has a continental climate with some maritime influence, and using 
the −3 °C (27 °F) coldest month (January) isotherm, the city lies within 
the transition zone from a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) to a 
humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa). Summers are typically warm to hot, 
rainy, and humid, while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain 
and snow, with cold temperatures. Spring and fall are usually mild, with 
varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. 
Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the influence of the 
Atlantic Ocean. The hottest month is July, with a mean temperature of 69.7 °F 
(20.9 °C). The coldest month is January, with a mean of 25.7 °F (−3.5 °C). 
Periods exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) in summer and below freezing in winter 
are not uncommon but rarely extended, with about 13 and 25 days per year 
seeing each, respectively. The city's average window for freezing temperatures 
is November 9 through April 5. Official temperature records have ranged 
from −21 °F (−29 °C) in February 1934, up to 101 °F (38 °C) in August 1949 
and 1974. Braintree's coastal location on the North Atlantic moderates 
its temperature, but makes the city very prone to Nor'easter weather systems 
that can produce much snow and rain. The city averages 48.63 inches (1,240 mm) 
of precipitation a year, with 61.1 inches (155 cm) of snowfall per season. 
Snowfall increases dramatically as one goes inland away from the city (especially 
north and west of the city)—away from the moderating influence of the ocean. 
Most snowfall occurs from December through March, as most years see no 
measurable snow in April and November, and snow is rare in May and October. 
There is also high year-to-year variability in snowfall; for instance, 
the winter of 2011−12 saw only 24.2 in (61.5 cm) of accumulating snow, 
but in the 2014–15 winter, the figure was 150.8 in (3.83 m). Fog is fairly 
common, particularly in spring and early summer, and the occasional tropical 
storm or hurricane can threaten the region, especially in late summer and 
early autumn. Due to its situation along the North Atlantic, the city is 
often subjected to sea breezes, especially in the late spring, when water 
temperatures are still quite cold and temperatures at the coast can be 
more than 20 °F (11 °C) colder than a few miles inland, sometimes dropping 
by that amount near midday. Thunderstorms occur from May to September, 
that are occasionally severe with large hail, damaging winds and heavy 
downpours. Although Braintree has never been struck by a violent tornado, 
the city itself has experienced many tornado warnings. Damaging storms 
are more common to areas north, west, and northwest of the city. As of 
the census[25] of 2000, there were 33,828 people, 12,652 households, and 
8,907 families residing in the town. The population density was 2,434.4 
people per square mile (939.6/km²). There were 12,973 housing units at

American, 3.14% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.64% from other races, 
and 0.95% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.16%

from 25 to 44, 24.0% from 45 to 64, and 18.1% who were 65 years of age 
or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females there were 
89.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.4 males. 
The median income for a household in the town is $115,590, and the median

median income of $89,607 versus $36,034 for females. The per capita income 
for the town was $28,683. About 2.1% of families and 3.8% of the population 
were below the poverty line, including 4.6% of those under age 18 and 3.3% 
of those age 65 or over. Braintree High School participates in the Bay

Athletic Association. The girls basketball team has won back-to-back state 
championships and finished 2014 undefeated.[28] The Braintree High dance

A planned sports complex in Braintree, the Braintree Athletic Complex, 
is scheduled to be located at Braintree High School and will feature two 
ice hockey rinks, a basketball court, a multi-use court, a swimming pool 
and an indoor baseball diamond.[31] Braintree is home to various educational 
institutions, both public and private. Public education at the primary 
and secondary levels is managed by Braintree Public Schools (BPS), a system 
that includes one kindergarten center, six elementary schools, two middle 
schools and one high school. Private and alternative education institutions 
situated in Braintree include Thayer Academy (TA) and Archbishop Williams 
High School (ABHS). CATS Academy, an internationally focused boarding school 
with three campuses in the United Kingdom, is in the process of building 
a school in the Braintree Highlands area and plans to open in 2016[32] 
Braintree is situated in the Greater Boston Area, which has rail, air, 
and highway facilities. State Route 128 and Interstate 95 divide the region 
into inner and outer zones, which are connected by numerous "spokes" providing 
direct access to the airport, port, and intermodal facilities of Boston. 
From 1948 to 1968, the town was the home of Braintree Airport, a general 
aviation airport located near Great Pond that was used by civil defense 
officials and private pilots. The airport featured a 2,800 foot dirt runway 
and offered flight training. Residential development, proximity to the 
town's water supply, and a number of accidents led to its closure in 1968.[33] 
[34] Principal highways in Braintree are Interstate 93 (which runs concurrently 
with U.S. 1) and Route 3, as well as 37, and 53. Entering Braintree from 
the north, I-93, Route 1, and Route 3 all run concurrently as the Southeast 
Expressway from Boston; in Braintree they diverge, with Route 3 heading 
south toward Cape Cod as the Pilgrims Highway, and I-93 and Route 1 heading 
west toward Route 128. Commuter rail service to South Station, Boston, 
is available on the Middleboro & Plymouth lines from the Braintree Red 
Line/Commuter Rail Station located on Union Street. The CapeFLYER rail 
service from Boston to Hyannis as well as Buzzards Bay stations also stops 
at Braintree Station. The MBTA Red Line is also accessible at the same 
location. Weekday rail service on the Greenbush Line started up in late 
2007 and is accessible from the Weymouth Landing/East Braintree located

From 1964 to 1991 Braintree was the home of a Valle's Steak House restaurant. 
The chain was an East Coast landmark that stretched from Maine to Florida. 
The 30,000 square foot Braintree restaurant was the largest in the chain 
when it opened and featured a dining room that sat 600 customers, banquet 
rooms that accommodated 1,000; parking for 700 cars, and two kitchens, 
one of which was used exclusively for banquets. The restaurant had over 
150 employees. Max Bodner of Quincy was the original manager.[35] One of 
the chain's busiest locations, it was capable of serving over 5,000 customers 
per day.[36] The restaurant changed names several times after the Valle's 
corporation closed in 1991 and was eventually razed to make way for a Toyota 
dealership.[37] Among the notable moments in the restaurant's history was 
in 1980 when then presidential candidate Ronald Reagan made a campaign
