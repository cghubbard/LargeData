Carl Demonte Crawford (born August 5, 1981), nicknamed "The Perfect Storm",[1][2] 
is an American professional baseball player who is a free agent.[3] He 
bats and throws left-handed. Crawford was drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays in the second round (52nd overall) of the 1999 Major League Baseball 
draft. He made his major league debut in 2002. Crawford has more triples 
(123) than any other active baseball player.[4] Crawford is a native of 
the Fifth Ward area of Houston. He participated in the Reviving Baseball 
in Inner Cities program, and attended Jefferson Davis High School in Houston, 
Texas,[5][6] and was a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. 
As a child, he was on the same little league team as Michael Bourn, who 
would become a star for the Houston Astros and the Atlanta Braves.[7] In 
high school baseball, he began working with former #1 pick Willie Ansley 
after his sophomore year.He batted .638 as a senior. In the summer of his 
junior year in high school coach Ansley advised him to get on a team that 
played in the same tournaments that Josh Beckett played in so he could 
be seen by the pro scouts and Crawford joined the Pasadena Stars select 
baseball team. It was there that he gained his first real exposure to Major 
League Baseball scouts. So intent on capitalizing on this exposure, he 
was advised by coach Ansley to skip basketball his senior year to concentrate 
on baseball so that his knees would be fresh from the beginning of the 
season. Crawford was offered scholarships to play basketball as a point 
guard at UCLA.[8] He also had an option to play college football as an 
option quarterback at Nebraska,[8] USC, Oklahoma, Florida, and Tulsa. He 
had originally signed a letter of intent to play football for Nebraska 
but he turned down both offers in favor of a baseball career.[8] Crawford 
was drafted by the Devil Rays in the second round (52nd overall) of the 
1999 Major League Baseball draft. In 2002, the Tampa Bay chapter of the 
BBWAA named Crawford the Devil Rays' Most Outstanding Rookie and he earned 
International League Rookie of the Year playing for the AAA Durham Bulls.[9] 
Crawford made his Major League debut at the young age of 20 on July 20, 
2002 against the Toronto Blue Jays. His first hit was in that game, a two 
RBI single off Steve Parris. He hit his first home run on August 10 off 
Shawn Sedlacek of the Kansas City Royals. He played in 63 games for the 
Devil Rays in 2002, batting .259 with 9 stolen bases. In 2003, he played 
nearly every day, batting .281 with 54 RBI and led the league with 55 steals. 
Along with Juan Pierre, Crawford was co-winner of the Negro Leagues Baseball 
Museum James "Cool Papa" Bell Legacy Award for 2003.[10] In 2004, Crawford 
stole 59 bases, again leading the league and posting the second-highest 
total in the majors that season. He batted .296 with 11 home runs and 55 
RBIs. Crawford also hit a league-leading 19 triples. He was selected for 
the All Star Game, played in his hometown of Houston, and was named Devil 
Rays team MVP in 2004 by the BBWAA. Crawford batted .301 in 2005, becoming 
just the third .300 hitter in Devil Rays history, joining Aubrey Huff (.311 
in 2003) and Fred McGriff (.310 in 1999). Crawford also posted career highs 
in hits (194), home runs (15), and RBI (81). He again led the league with 
15 triples and placed third in steals (46). On July 5, 2006 against the 
Boston Red Sox, Crawford became only the eighth player in history to get 
200 stolen bases before his 25th birthday. Crawford finished the season 
with career highs in batting average (.305) and home runs (18), joining 
Hall-of-Famer Rogers Hornsby as the only players in Major League history 
to increase their batting average and home run totals every year for five 
straight years.[11] He won a Fielding Bible Award for his defensive excellence 
in left field during the season.[12] Crawford was named an All-Star for 
the second time in 2007, becoming the first Devil Ray to receive the honor 
more than once. He homered in the 6th inning of the All-Star Game, on a 
3–2 pitch from Francisco Cordero of the Milwaukee Brewers. In the second 
half of the season, Crawford had a sore right wrist which had been bothering 
him for some time, and did not hit a home run for a period of 42 days. 
Prior to a game against the Toronto Blue Jays, he had an MRI and was listed 
as doubtful to play because of the wrist. However, he pinch hit as the 
game went into extra innings and hit a walk-off home run, ending his drought. 
This kicked off a run of four homers in ten games.[13] In August, ESPN.com 
named Crawford the Devil Rays' "Face of the Franchise".[14] On April 11, 
2008, Crawford accumulated his 1,000th hit, making him the eighth player 
to hit 1,000 and steal 250 bases before turning 27.[15] In game four of 
the American League Championship Series against the Boston Red Sox, Crawford 
tied an ALCS record with five hits in one game, going 5–5 and stealing 
two bases. After the season, he won his second Fielding Bible Award.[16] 
In 2008, he had surgery to fix the tendon of the middle finger of his right 
hand.[17][18] On May 3, 2009, Carl Crawford tied a modern-era record by 
stealing six bases in a game against the Boston Red Sox, part of a team-record 
eight total stolen bases.[19][20][21] On July 14, 2009, Crawford represented 
Tampa Bay in the 2009 All Star Game, where he was named MVP for a leaping 
catch at the top of the 8-foot outfield wall to prevent a possible go-ahead 
home run by Rockies outfielder Brad Hawpe.[22] In 2009 he had the best 
range factor of all starting major league left fielders (2.34).[23] He 
won his second consecutive Fielding Bible Award and third overall at left 
field.[24] On July 31, 2010, Crawford reached 400 stolen bases. He is the 
7th player in history to reach that mark before his 29th birthday.[25] 
On August 17, 2010, Crawford hit the 100th triple of his career, joining 
Ty Cobb as the only major league players to hit 100 triples and steal 400 
bases before the age of 30.[26] The Tampa Bay chapter of the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America voted Crawford the Most Valuable Player for the 
Rays in 2010.[27] Following the conclusion of the season, Crawford was 
given the Gold Glove Award, as well as the Silver Slugger Award.[28][29] 
On December 8, 2010, Crawford signed a 7-year, $142-million contract with 
the Boston Red Sox.[8][30] Crawford struggled to begin the 2011 season, 
batting .137 and stealing only 2 bases in his first 12 games.[31] On May 
3, he hit his 1,500th career hit, a single against Dan Haren of the Los 
Angeles Angels in the 3rd inning, becoming the 588th player with 1,500 
or more career hits. For the 2011 season, he batted .255 with an on-base 
percentage of .289.[32] Through 2011, he had the third-best career fielding 
percentage (.990) among all active major league left fielders, behind Ryan 
Braun and Reed Johnson.[33] Crawford injured his left wrist in January 
2012.[34] He had wrist surgery to repair cartilage damage,[17] but had 
discomfort in his elbow and was told he had a sprained ligament. He began 
the 2012 season on the 60-day disabled list. He had a rehab assignment 
with the Gulf Coast League, Double-A Portland, and Triple-A Pawtucket to 
recover from both injuries.[35] Crawford made his 2012 regular season debut 
on July 16, 2012, against the Chicago White Sox.[36] On August 23, 2012, 
Crawford underwent season-ending reconstructive Tommy John surgery to repair 
a chronic ulnar collateral tear in his left elbow.[34][37][38] For 2012, 
he batted .282/.306/.479 in 117 at bats.[39] After being traded to the 
Dodgers, Crawford voiced his unhappiness with the Red Sox organization 
and the city of Boston, claiming that the baseball environment was "toxic" 
and that he was in a "depression stage" with Boston. On August 25, 2012, 
he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers (along with Josh Beckett, Adrian 
Gonzalez, Nick Punto, and $11 million in cash) for James Loney, Iván DeJesús, 
Jr., Allen Webster, and two players to be named later (Jerry Sands and 
Rubby De La Rosa).[40] Despite initial concerns that his injury would keep 
him out for the first part of the 2013 season as well, Crawford made his 
Dodger debut as the starting left fielder and lead off hitter on Opening 
Day 2013.[41] Crawford got off to a hot start with the Dodgers in 2013, 
hitting .308 with 4 home runs in the month of April. In 2013 with the Dodgers, 
missing almost one full month with a hamstring injury, he played in 116 
games and hit .283/.329/.407 with 6 homers, 31 RBIs, and 15 stolen bases.[39] 
In the 2013 NLDS against the Braves, Crawford hit 3 home runs, including 
2 in Game Four, which gave the Dodgers a huge boost and allowed them to 
beat the Braves in four games.[42] Crawford had a slow start to the 2014 
season, hitting just .191 in the month of April. However, he bounced back 
with a strong month of May, hitting .333. On May 27, Crawford suffered 
a sprained left ankle in a game against the Cincinnati Reds, and was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list the next day.[43] He was reactivated on July 
10 after a rehab assignment with the Albuquerque Isotopes. Crawford finished 
the regular season with his highest batting average since leaving Tampa 
Bay. He hit .300 in 105 games, with 8 home runs, 46 RBIs, and 23 stolen 
bases. On April 27, Crawford tore his oblique muscle in a game against 
the Giants and was placed on the disabled list.[44] He did not rejoin the 
Dodgers active roster until July 21.[45] He appeared in 69 games for the 
Dodgers in 2015, hitting .265. Crawford spent the first two months of 2016 
as a backup outfielder/occasional pinch hitter. In 30 games, he hit .185 
with a .230 on-base percentage in 81 at bats. On June 5, Crawford was designated 
for assignment with approximately $35 million remaining on his contract.[46] 
On June 13, he was released by the Dodgers.[47] Crawford's cousin, J. P. 
Crawford, also plays baseball.[50] He was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies 
in the 1st round of the 2013 MLB draft, 16th overall. In December 2013, 
Crawford announced his engagement to Evelyn Lozada. Crawford has a son 
with Lozada and two children from a previous relationship.[51][52][53][54]
