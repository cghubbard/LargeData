Daytona Beach is a city in Volusia County, Florida, United States. It lies 
about 51 miles (82.1 km) northeast of Orlando, 86 miles (138.4 km) southeast 
of Jacksonville, and 242 miles (389.5 km) northwest of Miami. In the 2010 
U.S. Census, it had a population of 61,005. It is a principal city of the 
Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach, FL metropolitan statistical area, which 
was home to 590,289 people in 2010. Daytona Beach is also a principal city 
of the Fun Coast region of Florida. The city is historically known for 
its beach where the hard-packed sand allows motorized vehicles to drive 
on the beach in restricted areas.[6] This hard-packed sand made Daytona 
Beach a mecca for motorsports, and the old Daytona Beach Road Course hosted 
races for over 50 years. This was replaced in 1959 by Daytona International 
Speedway. The city is also the headquarters for NASCAR. Daytona Beach hosts 
large groups of out-of-towners that descend upon the city for various events, 
notably Speedweeks in early February when over 200,000 NASCAR fans come 
to attend the season-opening Daytona 500. Other events include the NASCAR 
Coke Zero 400 race in July, Bike Week in early March, Biketoberfest in 
late October, and the 24 Hours of Daytona endurance race in January. The 
area where Daytona Beach is today was once inhabited by the indigenous 
Timucuan Indians who lived in fortified villages. The Timucuas were nearly 
exterminated by contact with Europeans through war, enslavement and disease 
and became extinct as a racial entity through assimilation and attrition 
during the 18th century. The Seminole Indians, descendants of Creek Indians 
from Georgia and Alabama, frequented the area prior to the Second Seminole 
War. During the era of British rule of Florida between 1763 and 1783, the 
King's Road passed through present-day Daytona Beach. The road extended 
from St. Augustine, the capital of East Florida, to Andrew Turnbull's experimental 
colony in New Smyrna. In 1804 Samuel Williams received a land grant of 
3,000 acres (12 km2) from the Spanish Crown, which had regained Florida 
from the British after the American Revolution. This land grant encompassed 
the area that would become Daytona Beach. Williams built a slave-labor-based 
plantation to grow cotton, rice and sugar cane. His son Samuel Hill Williams 
would abandon the plantation during the Second Seminole War, when the Seminoles 
burned it to the ground. In 1871, Mathias Day, Jr. of Mansfield, Ohio, 
purchased a 2,144.5 acre tract of the former Williams Plantation, on the 
west bank of the tidal channel known as the Halifax River. He built a hotel 
around which the initial section of town, today the Daytona Beach Historic 
District, arose. In 1872, due to financial troubles, Day lost title to 
his land; nonetheless, residents decide to name the city Daytona in his 
honor, and incorporated the town in 1876.[7] In 1886, the St. Johns & Halifax 
River Railway arrived in Daytona. The line would be purchased in 1889 by 
Henry M. Flagler, who made it part of his Florida East Coast Railway. The 
separate towns of Daytona, Daytona Beach, Kingston, and Seabreeze merged 
as "Daytona Beach" in 1926, at the urging of civic leader J.B. Kahn and 
others. By the 1920s, it was dubbed "The World's Most Famous Beach". Daytona's 
wide beach of smooth, compacted sand attracted automobile and motorcycle 
races beginning in 1902, as pioneers in the industry tested their inventions.[8] 
It hosted land speed record attempts beginning in 1904, when William K. 
Vanderbilt set an unofficial record of 92.307 mph (148.554 km/h).[9] Land 
speed racers from Barney Oldfield to Henry Seagrave to Malcolm Campbell 
would visit Daytona repeatedly and make the 23 mi (37 km) beach course 
famous.[10] Record attempts, including numerous fatal endeavors such as 
Frank Lockhart (Stutz Black Hawk, 1926) and Lee Bible (Triplex Special, 
1929), would continue until Campbell's March 7, 1935 effort, which set 
the record at 276.816 mph (445.492 km/h) and marked the end of Daytona's 
land speed racing days.[11] On March 8, 1936, the first stock car race 
was held on the Daytona Beach Road Course, located in the present-day Town 
of Ponce Inlet. In 1958, William France Sr. and NASCAR created the Daytona 
International Speedway to replace the beach course. Automobiles are still 
permitted on most areas of the beach, at a maximum speed of 10 mph (16 km/h). 
Daytona Beach is located at 29°12′N 81°2′W (29.2073, −81.0379). According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 64.93 sq mi 
(168 km2). of which 58.68 sq mi (152 km2) is land and 6.25 sq mi (16 km2) 
is water. Water is 9.6% of the total area. The city of Daytona Beach is 
split in two by the Halifax River lagoon, part of the Intracoastal Waterway, 
and sits on the Atlantic Ocean. It is bordered on the north by Holly Hill 
and Ormond Beach and on the south by Daytona Beach Shores, South Daytona 
and Port Orange. Daytona Beach has a humid subtropical climate or Cfa – 
typical of the Gulf and South Atlantic states. As is typical of much of 
Florida, there are two seasons in Daytona Beach, the hot and wet season 
(late May through October) and the warm and dry season (November through 
April). In the hot season (summer) average daytime highs are in the 80s 
and low 90s (26 to 33 °C) and average night-time lows are near 70 °F (21 °C) 
in Daytona Beach. The Bermuda High pumps hot and unstable tropical air 
from the Bahamas and Gulf of Mexico, resulting in daily, but brief thundershowers. 
A large amount of the yearly rainfall in Daytona Beach falls during this 
time of year. Fall and spring are considered near perfect weather-wise, 
warm and sunny, with daily highs in the 75 to 80 F (21 to 24 °C) range 
and overnight lows in the 50s to low 60s (10 to 17 °C). In the warm and 
dry season (winter), Daytona Beach has mostly mild and sunny weather typical 
of cities on the Florida peninsula. The coolest months are from December 
through February; average daytime highs range from 65 to 70 °F (18 to 21 °C) 
and nighttime lows are near 50 F (10 °C). Occasional cold fronts often 
drop the daytime temperatures into the 50s F with nights in the 30s F a 
few times each month. Like much of Florida, Daytona Beach often can be 
very dry in late winter and early spring, and brush fires and water restrictions 
can be an issue. Daytona Beach averages only 6 frosts per year according 
to the National Weather Service office in Melbourne. There is no record 
of snow on the ground in Daytona Beach in the last 109[when?] years; however, 
snow flurries have been observed twice since 1880 – on January 1, 1977 
and in January 2010. Typically tropical cyclones pass offshore once they 
reach the northern portion of the Atlantic coast of Florida. As such, the 
hurricane risk for Daytona Beach is significantly lower than areas of southern 
Florida like Miami and Key West. The 2004 hurricane season was by far the 
most active in the Daytona Beach area in the last 50 years. However, since 
1950 there has only been one direct hit by a tropical cyclone to the Daytona 
Beach area, Hurricane Donna in 1960. Although Daytona Beach has a significantly 
lesser tornado risk than areas like the Great Plains and Midwest, there 
have been a few deadly and destructive tornadoes in the last 100 years 
in Daytona Beach area. Most recently, on February 22, 1998 a tornado killed 
3 people, injured 70 people, and caused $31 million in damages. On July 
3, 1992, a 28-mile (45 km) long rogue wave hit the Volusia County beaches. 
The wave's range was from Ormond Beach in the north, to New Smyrna Beach 
on the south. The crest was 9 feet (2.7 m) high and centered at Daytona 
Beach. Sailboats crashed ashore onto cars and many people suffered cuts 
and bruises from glass and debris. Two people required hospitalization 
and 200 vehicles were damaged. 75 injuries were reported. The prevailing 
theory is that an underwater landslide caused the rogue wave, although 
others have theorized that it was the result of a squall line.[14][15] 
Under Daytona Beach's commission-manager form of government, voters elect 
a City commission which consists of seven members who serve four-year, 
staggered terms. Six are elected by district, the Mayor is elected city-wide. 
The City Commission establishes ordinances and policies for the city. It 
also reviews and approves the city budget annually. The Commission appoints 
a City Manager, who carries out the will of the Commission and handles 
day-to-day business. Law enforcement in Daytona Beach is provided by the 
241-member Daytona Beach Police Department (DBPD) headed by police chief 
Mike Chitwood. In a unique and controversial program to help fund the Police 
Explorer program, run by a subsidiary of the Boy Scouts of America, T-shirts 
with the words Scumbag Eradication Team: Not in Our Town are sold at the 
police headquarters.[16] The T-shirts contain a caricature of Chief Chitwood 
standing next to a toilet bowl with the legs of multiple individuals sticking 
out. The T-shirt has been cited in at least one lawsuit against the DBPD 
alleging police brutality, the lawyer in the case in which the client sustained 
broken ribs and a fractured eye socket during an arrest for an open container 
of beer, claims the T-shirt shows the DBPD condones violence.[17] The Volusia 
County Sheriff's department, headed by Ben E. Johnson is a countywide law 
enforcement agency with 446 sworn positions, 438 civilian employees, 300 
volunteers and an annual operating budget of $73 million that has jurisdiction 
in unincorporated areas of Volusia County and provides additional law enforcement 
support to Daytona Beach during such events as the Daytona 500 and aids 
in joint investigations of certain crimes.[18] The Volusia County Beach 
Patrol provides law enforcement as well as EMT services along Volusia County 
beaches including the beaches in the city of Daytona Beach.[19] The city 
of Daytona Beach made national headlines when it designated the several 
mile radius around Main Street on the barrier island portion of the city 
as a blighted area and has targeted it for redevelopment by private developers. 
This follows the Supreme Court decision of the eminent domain case in Kelo 
v. City of New London, which upheld the right of municipalities the right 
to use eminent domain to take private property for redevelopment by private 
entities.[20] The United States Postal Service operates a post office at 
500 Bill France Boulevard in Daytona Beach Daytona Beach is part of Florida's 
6th congressional district.[21] It is part of Florida's 25th and 26th State 
House of Representatives Districts and the 6th and 8th State Senate Districts. 
Florida's 6th congressional district, which extends from the southern Jacksonville 
suburbs to New Smyrna Beach and includes St. Augustine and Daytona Beach, 
is currently represented by Republican Ron DeSantis. As of 2010, there

over, there were 98.5 males. In 2000, the median income for a household 
in the city was $25,439, and the median income for a family was $33,514. 
Males had a median income of $25,705 versus $20,261 for females. The per 
capita income for the city was $17,530. 23.6% of the population and 16.9% 
of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 34.9% 
of those under the age of 18 and 12.1% of those 65 and older were living 
below the poverty line. As of 2000, English spoken as a first language 
accounted for 90.37% of all residents, while 9.62% spoke other languages 
as their mother tongue. The most significant were Spanish speakers who 
made up 4.01% of the population, while French came up as the third most 
spoken language, which made up 0.90%, and German was at fourth, at 0.86%, 
as well as, Arabic with 0.66% of the population.[24] The Museum of Arts 
and Sciences is the primary cultural facility for Daytona Beach and Volusia 
County. Other museums located in the city include the Southeast Museum 
of Photography and the Halifax Historical Museum. The Museum of Arts and 
Sciences is actually a collection of museums and galleries and includes 
the Klancke Environmental Complex, the Cuban Museum, Root Family Museum 
featuring one of the largest Coca-Cola collections in the world, the Dow 
American Gallery and the Bouchelle Center for Decorative Arts which together 
form what is probably one of the finest collections of furniture and decorative 
arts in the Southeast. There are also changing exhibitions and a children's 
science center opened in 2008. Since 1952, the non-profit Daytona Beach 
Symphony Society has sponsored performances by U.S. and international orchestras, 
opera and dance companies each season at the Peabody Auditorium.[25] Daytona 
Beach is home to the headquarters of NASCAR, IMSA, International Speedway 
Corporation, United States Tennis Association in Florida, and the LPGA. 
The Daytona International Speedway hosts the annual 24 Hours of Daytona 
(Rolex 24 At Daytona) and Daytona 500 races, among other events. In addition 
to motorsports, Daytona is also the home of the Daytona Tortugas, a minor 
league baseball team of the Florida State League who play at Jackie Robinson 
Ballpark; it was established in 1993 and currently has 6 championships. 
There are a number of golf courses in Daytona Beach. The city attracts 
over 8,000,000 tourists each year. Special events that draw visitors to 
Daytona Beach include: During motorcycle events (Bike Week and Biketoberfest), 
several hundred thousand bikers from all over the world visit the greater 
Daytona Beach area. The city is also often associated with spring break, 
though the efforts of the local government to discourage rowdiness, combined 
with the rise of other spring break destinations, have affected Daytona's 
preeminence as a spring break destination. It is the destination of Dayton 
2 Daytona, an annual event that draws over 3,000 University of Dayton college 
students since 1977. AM FM A major part of the Daytona Beach area economy 
is involved in the tourist industry. Over 8 million visitors came to the 
Daytona Beach area in 2004. The area's economy includes other industries 
besides tourism, such as manufacturing. Daytona Beach has industrial sites 
within an enterprise zone and sites within a foreign trade zone adjacent 
to Daytona Beach International Airport. Prime Interstate 4 and Interstate 
95 sites are available with access to road, air, rail and water transportation. 
Companies and organizations that have their corporate headquarters or a 
major presence in the area: Public primary and secondary education is handled 
by Volusia County Schools. Daytona Beach has two public traditional high 
schools, two middle schools and six elementary schools. Some of the larger 
private schools include Father Lopez Catholic High School. Elementary schools 
Middle schools High schools Vocational schools Healthcare in Daytona Beach 
is dominated by Halifax Health (formerly known as Halifax Hospital). The 
Halifax Hospital Taxing District was established in 1927 by an Act of the 
Florida Legislature as a public hospital district.[27] There are dozens 
of individual practitioners and Professional Associations (PA) in the Daytona 
Beach area. Basic utilities in Daytona Beach (water and sewer) are provided 
by the City Government. The city has a successful recycling program with 
separate pickups for garbage, yard waste and recycling. Collection is provided 
by several private companies under contract to Volusia County, Florida. 
Passenger airline services are located at Daytona Beach International Airport 
(DAB), which is centrally located within the city adjacent to Daytona International 
Speedway. The site was first used as an airport with terminals being constructed 
in 1952 and 1958. The present facility was constructed in 1992 at the cost 
of $46 million, and includes both a domestic terminal and an International 
terminal. Despite the new facilities, DAB has found difficulty in attracting 
and retaining carriers; Continental Airlines, AirTran Airways, and United 
Airlines discontinued flights to Daytona in 2007 and 2008.[28] LTU & American 
Airlines also serviced Daytona Beach during the 1980s and 1990s, both of 
which ended all flights in 1994 & 1997. Current passenger airlines serving 
DAB include Delta Air Lines (with nonstop service to Atlanta), American 
Airlines (with non-stop service to Charlotte), and JetBlue Airways (with 
non-stop service to New York-JFK). All three carriers offer connecting 
service from those cities to destinations worldwide. International flights 
from DAB fly to destinations in the Bahamas through air taxi and charter 
services Airgate Aviation and IslandPass; non-stop flights are available 
from DAB to Marsh Harbour, Treasure Cay, and North Eleuthera.[29] DAB is 
also heavily used for general aviation, largely due to Embry–Riddle Aeronautical 
University, whose campus is located at the airport. Larger airports nearby 
are Orlando International Airport and Jacksonville International Airport, 
both of which are approximately one and one half hours away. Daytona Beach 
is easily accessible by I-95 that runs North and South and I-4 connecting 
Daytona Beach with Orlando and Tampa. U.S. 1 (Ridgewood Avenue) also passes 
through Daytona Beach. A1A is a scenic North/South route along the beach. 
The Volusia County Parking Garage is located at 701 Earl Street at North 
Atlantic Avenue (A1A). The garage is strategically located, next to the 
Ocean Center, Daytona Lagoon, and across the street from the Hilton Hotel 
and Ocean Walk Shoppes. Over one thousand parking spaces are available 
inside the garage, which also houses an intermodal transfer station for 
VoTran. There are four bridges over the Halifax River (and Intracoastal 
Waterway) at Daytona Beach. They include (starting from furthest downstream) 
the Veterans Memorial Bridge (which carries CR 4050 traffic), the Broadway 
Bridge (which carries US 92 traffic), the Main Street Bridge (which carries 
CR 4040 traffic), and the Seabreeze Bridge (which carries SR 430 traffic). 
All four bridges charge no toll to traffic.[30] Veterans Memorial Bridge 
Broadway Bridge Main Street Bridge Seabreeze Bridge Passenger railroad 
service to Daytona Beach was established no later than 1889 by the Jacksonville, 
St. Augustine and Halifax River Railway, predecessor of the Florida East 
Coast Railroad (FEC). Passenger trains continued calling at Daytona Beach 
till 1968, when the FEC terminated passenger operations system-wide. Daytona 
Beach is served by Amtrak by way of a Thruway Motorcoach connection between 
the beachside and Amtrak's DeLand Station, 28 miles (45 km) to the west. 
There, the service connects northbound with train 92, the Silver Star, 
and train 98, the Silver Meteor. Southbound connections from Daytona Beach 
are limited to the Silver Meteor's southbound train 97. The DeLand – Daytona 
Beach service is Amtrak's only Florida Thruway Motorcoach route provided 
by a taxi-cab, rather than a bus. National Historic Places Other points 
of interest Novels set in Daytona Beach include: There have been a number 
of movies based on Daytona Beach, usually with a racing theme. The most 
recent example was the 1990 hit Days of Thunder, parts of which were filmed 
in Daytona Beach and nearby DeLand. Chris Rea wrote the song "Daytona" 
which was in his 1989 album The Road to Hell. Suzi Quatro's song "Daytona 
Demon" is often believed to refer to the city.[31] Also, about half of 
the video for the song "Steal My Sunshine" by Len was filmed at Daytona 
Beach. Daytona Beach was also the destination of a group of plagued teenagers 
in the movie Final Destination 2. Daytona Beach was also one of the settings
