Daniel William Daub (January 12, 1868 â€“ March 25, 1951) was a 19th-century 
Major League Baseball pitcher born in Middletown, Ohio. After attending 
and playing baseball for Denison University,[1] he played for the Cincinnati 
Reds in 1892 and with the Brooklyn Grooms/Bridegrooms from 1893 through 
1897.[2] The New York Times reported on December 22, 1895, that Dan was 
among approximately 20 men who stoned and fired shotguns, also known as 
whitecapping, upon the home of Mrs. Wescoe of Hamilton, Ohio. Daub, who 
passes his winters in Mintonville, Ohio, was also among those that had 
warrants issued for his arrest.[3] After his playing career was over, Dan 
became the coach of the Ohio Wesleyan University baseball team, a post 
he held for the 1902 season,[4] then he resigned before the following season. 
His replacement was a ballplayer named Branch Rickey, who was recently 
ruled ineligible to play college ball due to his prior professional baseball 
career.[5] Daub died at the age of 83 in Bradenton, Florida, and is interred
