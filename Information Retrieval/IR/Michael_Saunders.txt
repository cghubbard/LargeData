Michael Edward Brett Saunders (born November 19, 1986) is a Canadian professional 
baseball outfielder who is a free agent. He has played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays, and was 
nicknamed "The Condor" by Dave Sims, who attributed the origin of it to 
Lee Tinsley.[1] Saunders started his baseball playing Little League Baseball 
in the Gordon Head Baseball Association, and was a member of Team Canada 
at the 1999 Little League World Series.[2] While attending Lambrick Park 
Secondary School in Victoria, British Columbia, Saunders played high school 
baseball for the Victoria Mariners of the British Columbia Premier Baseball 
League. He then played for the Tallahassee Community College Eagles prior 
to being drafted.[3] The Seattle Mariners selected Saunders in the 11th 
round of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft. He then spent the 2005 season 
with the Everett AquaSox of the Short Season-A Northwest League, hitting 
.270 with seven home runs and 39 runs batted in (RBI). In 2006, he was 
promoted to the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers of the Class-A Midwest League, 
hitting .239 with four home runs and 39 RBI. Despite struggling in 2006, 
for 2007 he was promoted to the High Desert Mavericks of the Advanced-A 
California League, where he excelled, hitting .299 with 14 home runs and 
77 RBI, before he was called up to the West Tennessee Diamond Jaxx of the 
Double-A Southern League, where he finished off the season hitting .288 
with one home run and seven RBI in 15 games. Saunders started the 2008 
season once again in West Tennessee, where he hit .290 with eight home 
runs and 30 RBI in 67 games before being promoted to the Tacoma Rainiers 
of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League on June 17.[citation needed] After 
beginning the 2009 season with the Rainiers where he hit .313 with 13 home 
runs and 32 RBI in 243 at-bats, Saunders was promoted from Tacoma on July 
25, 2009, when the Mariners designated Wladimir Balentien for assignment.[4][5] 
He made his MLB debut that day in a game against the Cleveland Indians 
at Safeco Field, where he went hitless against Jeremy Sowers in the Mariners 
10–3 loss. His first major league hit was a single off of Cliff Lee on 
July 26, 2009.[citation needed] On May 6, 2010, Saunders was recalled from 
Tacoma after the Mariners put Milton Bradley on the restricted list.[6] 
Three days later, he hit his first Major League home run off Angels pitcher 
Ervin Santana. He finished the 2010 season with a .211 batting average, 
10 home runs, and 33 RBI.[7] Saunders played only 58 games for the Mariners 
in 2011, and batted .149 with just two home runs and eight RBI.[7] In 2012, 
Saunders played a career-high 139 games and greatly improved upon his 2011 
campaign. He hit .247 with 19 home runs and 57 RBI.[7] He played in 132 
games the following season. Saunders finished 2013 with a .236 batting 
average, 12 home runs, and 46 RBI.[7] In 2014, Saunders battled a number 
of injuries that limited him to 78 games, but finished with a career-high 
.273 average with 8 home runs and 34 RBI.[7] At the end of the 2014 season, 
Jack Zduriencik, the general manager of the Mariners, publicly criticized 
Saunders' work ethic, which Saunders challenged.[8] On December 3, 2014, 
the Mariners traded Saunders to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for pitcher 
J. A. Happ.[9][10] Saunders agreed to a one-year, $2.875 million contract 
on January 16, 2015, to avoid salary arbitration.[11] On February 25, Saunders 
stepped on a sprinkler head while shagging fly balls and tore his meniscus.[12] 
Initially, the expectation was for Saunders to be on the disabled list 
until the All-Star break. However, after having surgery to remove 60% of 
his meniscus, the estimate was reduced to 4–6 weeks.[13] He was assigned 
to the Advanced-A Dunedin Blue Jays for a rehab assignment on April 8.[14] 
After the Blue Jays lost 12–3 to the Tampa Bay Rays on April 24, Saunders 
was activated off the disabled list.[15] He experienced discomfort in his 
knee in early May, missing several games after having fluid drained and 
receiving a cortisone injection. Saunders returned to the line-up on May 
9, but was placed on the 15-day disabled list the following day to rest 
his knee.[16] After remaining on the disabled list into August, Saunders 
was officially shut down for the remainder of the 2015 season on August 
18.[17] He appeared in just 9 games for the Blue Jays, batting .194 with 
3 RBI.[18] On January 15, 2016, Saunders and the Blue Jays avoided salary 
arbitration by agreeing to a one-year, $2.9 million contract.[19] In a 
13–3 win over the Baltimore Orioles on June 17, Saunders hit three home 
runs for the first time in his career, and joined Joey Votto, Justin Morneau, 
and Larry Walker as the only Canadian players to hit three in a game and 
becoming the first to do it for a Canadian team.[20] He also added 8 RBI 
in the game, which established another career-high.[21] Saunders was named 
as one of five candidates for the All-Star Game Final Vote campaign on 
July 5.[22] Saunders was announced as the Final Vote winner on July 8.[23] 
Saunders also represented Canada at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.[24] 
Serving as Canada's primary right-fielder, Saunders had 8 hits in 28 at-bats 
out of the third spot in the line-up. He scored five runs and had four 
RBI in seven games, while his two home runs led Canada to a 6th-place finish. 
Saunders represented Canada at the 2013 World Baseball Classic and was
