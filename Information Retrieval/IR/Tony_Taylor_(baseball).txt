Antonio Nemesio (Sanchez) Taylor (born December 19, 1935 in Central Alava, 
Cuba)[1] is a former Cuban professional baseball player. He spent 19-years 
in Major League Baseball playing for the Chicago Cubs (1958–60), Philadelphia 
Phillies (1960–71 and 1974–76), and Detroit Tigers (1971–73) as a second 
baseman. He batted and threw right-handed. He was inducted into the Philadelphia 
Baseball Wall of Fame in 2002.[2] Taylor posted a career .261 batting average 
with 75 home runs and 598 RBI in 2195 games. Taylor had signed at age 18 
as third baseman[1] in the New York Giants organization but didn't go there 
and make their roster, but came to the major leagues with the Chicago Cubs 
in 1958 where he was their starting second baseman in 1958 and 1959.[1][3] 
Tony Taylor had a small role in one of baseball history's weirdest plays. 
It took place during a game played on June 30, 1959, between the St. Louis 
Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. Stan Musial was at the plate, with a count 
of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor 
and rolling all the way to the backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball 
four, however Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial foul tipped the 
ball. Because the ball was still in play, and because Delmore was embroiled 
in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial took it upon himself 
to try for second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, third 
baseman Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound 
up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting 
it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball 
and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying 
for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Taylor. Anderson's 
throw flew over Tony Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same 
time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop 
Ernie Banks. Musial, though, did not see Dark's throw and only noticed 
Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to 
third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay 
he was ruled out.[4] Taylor was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along 
with Cal Neeman for Don Cardwell and Ed Bouchee early in the 1960 season.[1] 
Despite the fact Philadelphia was a mediocre team, Taylor established himself 
and was named to the National League All-Star team that year.[1] A solid 
and dependable performer, Taylor held the record having played in 1,003 
games for the Phillies at second base (the record was later broken by Chase 
Utley), and his six steals of home, ranks him second on the Phillies' all-time 
list.[5] Taylor was among the first athletes in history to appear on a 
live satellite broadcast feed. On 22 July 1962 the first live Transatlantic 
broadcast was made, relayed by Telstar in the 20 minutes that it orbited 
over the Atlantic Ocean. As lead-in filler before a speech by President 
Kennedy, a 90-second clip of a televised game between Philadelphia Phillies 
and the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, featuring Tony Taylor hitting a 
ball pitched by Cal Koonce to right fielder George Altman, was captured 
and broadcast live to Europe. In 1963, Taylor hit .281 and collected career-highs 
in runs (102) and hits (182), and the next season, he made the defensive 
play that saved Jim Bunning's perfect game. In 1970, he hit a career-high 
.301 average with 26 doubles, nine triples and nine homers. Dealt to the 
Detroit Tigers in the 1971 midseason, Taylor helped them to a division 
title a year later.[1] A free agent before the 1974 season, he signed again 
with the Phillies and became a valuable utility man and pinch hitter for 
his final three major league seasons. Following his retirement as a player, 
Taylor coached for the Phillies and Marlins.[1] One of the most popular 
Phillies ever, he was inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame 
in 2002.[2] Tony Taylor was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball 
Museum Hall of Fame on April 30, 2004 in a pregame ceremony at SBC Park,
