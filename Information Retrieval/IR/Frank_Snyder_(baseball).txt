As player As coach Frank Elton Snyder (May 27, 1894 in San Antonio, Texas 
â€“ January 5, 1962 in San Antonio, Texas), was an American professional 
baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher 
from 1912 to 1927 for the New York Giants and St. Louis Cardinals.[1] Nicknamed 
Pancho, Snyder was of Mexican descent on his mother's side.[2] Snyder began 
his major league career with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1912 at the age 
of 18.[1] He was traded to the New York Giants in the middle of the 1919 
season.[3] Snyder was a member of John McGraw's New York Giants teams that 
won four consecutive National League pennants between 1921 and 1924 and 
played on two World Series winners in 1921 and 1922.[1] Snyder also homered 
in the final game of the 1923 World Series, but the Yankees staged a comeback 
to defeat the Giants. During that period, Snyder posted a batting average 
above .300 three times, with a .320 average in 1921, a .343 average in 
1922 and a .302 average in 1924.[1] Snyder hit the first major league home 
run in the history of Braves Field in 1922.[4] It was the first home run 
hit in the seven seasons played at the cavernous ballpark. In 1926, he 
was selected off waivers by the St. Louis Cardinals.[1] He played for the 
Cardinals in 1927 before retiring at the end of the season at the age of 
33.[1] In a sixteen-year major league career, Snyder played in 1,392 games, 
accumulating 1,122 hits in 4,229 at bats for a .265 career batting average 
along with 44 triples, 47 home runs and 525 runs batted in.[1] A good defensive 
player, his .981 career fielding average was 8 points higher than the league 
average over the span of his playing career.[1] Snyder led National League 
catchers in fielding percentage three times: in 1914, 1923 and 1925.[5] 
He also led the league twice in putouts and caught stealing percentage 
and, once in assists and in baserunners caught stealing.[1] His 204 assists 
as a catcher in 1915 is the seventh highest single-season total in major 
league baseball history.[6] His 1,332 career assists rank him 17th all-time 
among major league catchers.[7] Richard Kendall of the Society for American 
Baseball Research devised an unscientific study that ranked Snyder as the 
ninth-most dominating fielding catcher in major league history.[8] His 
reputation as a defensive standout is enhanced because of the era in which 
he played. In the Deadball Era, catchers played a huge defensive role, 
given the large number of bunts and stolen base attempts, as well as the 
difficulty of handling the spitball pitchers who dominated pitching staffs.[9] 
After his playing career, he served as a coach for the New York Giants,
