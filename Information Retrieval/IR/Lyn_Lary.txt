Lynford Hobart (Lyn) Lary (January 28, 1906 â€“ January 9, 1973) was a shortstop 
in Major League Baseball from 1929 through 1940, primarily for the New 
York Yankees. Lary batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Armona, 
California. In a 12-season career, Lary posted a .269 batting average with 
38 home runs and 526 RBI in 1302 games played. A well-traveled shortstop, 
Lary played for six different teams in a span of twelve years, including 
two stints with the St. Louis Browns and playing for three teams in 1939. 
A good defensive player, he had good hands with a strong arm and was competent 
on the double play. Primarily a singles hitter, his hustle on the bases 
was shown by taking an extra base or for breaking up a double play. He 
ended his career with a 1.50 walk-to-strikeout ratio (705-to-470). Lary 
debuted with the New York Yankees in 1929, finishing with a .309 average. 
The next season he hit .289, and .280 in 1931. That season, he collected 
107 RBI, the most ever by a Yankees shortstop, and was one of six Yankees 
to have at least 100 runs scored. Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth, Ben Chapman, Earle 
Combs and Joe Sewell were the others. Lary also had career-numbers in home 
runs (10) and triples (nine). From 1934 through 1936, Lary divided his 
playing time between the Yankees, Boston Red Sox, St, Louis Browns and 
Washington Senators. Before the 1935 season, he was traded by the Red Sox 
to the Washington Senators in exchange for future Hall of Famer Joe Cronin. 
Playing for the 1936 Browns, he hit .289 with 112 runs and led the American 
League with 37 stolen bases and 155 games played. In 1937 with the Cleveland 
Indians, he batted .290 with 110 runs and posted career-highs in hits (187) 
and doubles (46). In 1939, Lary started with Cleveland, was traded to the 
Brooklyn Dodgers in the midseason, then returned to St. Louis for the rest 
of the year. He retired in 1940, after a part-time season for the Browns.
