John Anthony Franco (born September 17, 1960 in Brooklyn, New York) is 
a former Major League Baseball left-handed relief pitcher. During a 22-year 
baseball career spanning 1984–2005, he pitched for three different National 
League teams, the Cincinnati Reds, New York Mets, and Houston Astros. His 
1,119 career games pitched is an NL record, and is ranked fourth in major 
league history; his 424 career saves ranked second in major league history 
when he retired, and remains the most by a left-hander. For 15 of his 22 
seasons, he played for the New York Mets, serving as team captain in his 
final years with the team. Franco grew up in the Bensonhurst section of 
Brooklyn. His father, the late Jim Franco, was a New York City Department 
of Sanitation worker who encouraged his son's baseball aspirations; Franco 
honored his father by wearing an orange Sanitation Department work-shirt 
under his jersey. John graduated from Lafayette High School in Brooklyn 
and St. John's University in Queens, where he pitched two no-hitters in 
his freshman year. John is married to his high school sweetheart, Rose, 
whom he has known since he was 17.[1] They have three children: J.J., Nicole 
and Ella. Ella now attends school in manhattan [2] His son J.J. Franco, 
who was drafted by the Mets out of high school, attended Brown University 
where he played as an infielder. J.J. was drafted by the Atlanta Braves 
in the 2014 MLB draft.[3] Throughout his career, Franco supplied tickets 
to made members of the Bonnano crime family of the American Mafia, and 
on one occasion Canadian organized crime figures, according to FBI documents 
made public in 1994. There was no suggestion that he commited any crimes, 
but his behavoior was a violation of Major League Baseball rules forbidding 
contact with known criminals. The story was broken by Jerry Capeci. [4][5][6] 
Franco was originally selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 8, 1981 
in the 5th round of the amateur draft. Before reaching the major leagues; 
however, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds on May 9, 1983 with Brett 
Wise for Rafael Landestoy. Landestoy batted under .200 before retiring 
the following year while Franco was a star reliever for much of the next 
two decades. Franco debuted with the Reds on April 24, 1984. Franco was 
a traditional relief pitcher with a "90-mph fastball and a change-up that 
breaks away from a righthanded batter like a screwball."[7] Throughout 
his six seasons with the Reds, Franco was a successful closer, winning 
the National League Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award in 1988. He helped 
the Reds finish second four seasons in a row (1985–1988). On December 6, 
1989, at the age of 29, he was traded with Don Brown to the Mets for Randy 
Myers and Kip Gross. He remained with the Mets organization until the end 
of the 2004 season. During his time with the Mets, he won the Rolaids Relief 
Man of the Year Award in 1990, became team captain, and remained the closer 
until 1999, when he moved to a setup role for new closer Armando Benítez. 
He led the league in saves for the 1988, 1990, and 1994 seasons. He reached 
the postseason for the first time in 1999 and the World Series in 2000. 
On May 11, 1996, in a game against the Chicago Cubs, the Mets held "John 
Franco Day" to celebrate his 300th career save. In the fifth inning, a 
brawl that cleared both benches and bullpens resulted in Franco being ejected 
from the game, along with eight other players. An unusual occurrence considering 
it was his "day" and he was in the bullpen. Injuries caused Franco to miss 
the 2002 baseball season, but he made a successful recovery from surgery 
and returned in June 2003. He signed a one-year contract for the 2004 season. 
He finished with a 2-7 record with 36 strikeouts and a 5.28 ERA in 46 innings. 
In January 2005, he was signed to a one-year deal with the Astros, at the 
age of 44, making him at that time the oldest active pitcher in Major League 
Baseball. On July 1, 2005, Franco was designated for assignment, and he 
was subsequently released, which proved to be the end of his baseball career. 
He also most recently appeared on the television show Pros vs Joes. During 
a recent interview, he revealed that he never threw a screw ball, but instead 
only threw a circle changeup.[8] On March 29, 2009, Franco threw the ceremonial 
first pitch in the first game played on Citi Field, a Big East college 
game between St. John's (his alma mater) and Georgetown. On June 3, 2012, 
in a ceremony at Citi Field, Franco was inducted into the New York Mets
