John Wesley Callison (March 12, 1939 – October 12, 2006) was an American 
professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
for 16 seasons and is best known for his years with the Philadelphia Phillies 
as a right fielder from 1960 through 1969. He was an All-Star for three 
seasons and four All-Star games.[a] He led the National League (NL) in 
triples twice and doubles once, and gained his greatest prominence in the 
1964 season in which he was named the MVP of the All-Star Game and he was 
the runner-up for the NL Most Valuable Player Award. He also led the NL 
in outfield assists four consecutive times and in double plays once, and 
ended his career among the top five Phillies in home runs (185) and triples 
(84). Born in Qualls, Oklahoma, Callison batted left-handed and threw right-handed. 
He was signed by the Chicago White Sox out of high school in 1957, being 
assigned to the Class-C Bakersfield Bears in the California League, where 
he had a .340 batting average with 17 home runs and 31 stolen bases. The 
next season, he was advanced to the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians, where 
he led the American Association in home runs. In September 1958, he was 
recalled by the White Sox, where he had a .297 batting average in 18 games. 
In 1959, Callison split time between Chicago and Indianapolis. He was not 
on the World Series roster when the White Sox lost the series to the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, and in December he was traded to the Phillies for third 
baseman Gene Freese.[1] Callison became a fan favorite in Philadelphia; 
Supreme Court Justice and lifelong Phillies fan Samuel Alito recalls he 
"adopted Johnny Callison out there in right field" as a boy.[2] Over the 
next decade, Callison would be named to the NL All-Star roster three times 
(1962, 64-65).[b] In 1962, he batted an even .300, the only time he would 
reach that mark, and led the NL with 10 triples. On June 27, 1963, he hit 
for the cycle against the Pittsburgh Pirates. On July 23, 1962, in a game 
against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, Callison had the first hit (a 
single) seen live by television audiences in Europe. A small segment of 
the game was featured that day in the first transatlantic television broadcast 
via the Telstar satellite, which had been launched 13 days earlier. The 
crowd of 6,699 cheered wildly when the public address announcer told them 
the game was being transmitted live to Europe. Callison's hit (in the top 
of the third inning) was fielded by Cubs right fielder George Altman. Callison 
had hit the first pitch he saw in that at-bat from Cubs pitcher Cal Koonce. 
There was one out and no score by either team at the time. European and 
U.S. viewers also saw the previous play, a flyout to Altman by Phillies' 
leadoff hitter Tony Taylor. It was the first and, as of 2012, the only 
segment of an American sporting event to be televised live by ABC, CBS 
and NBC simultaneously. The Phillies went on to win the game 5-3. The 1964 
season became best remembered, however, for the Phillies' late-season collapse; 
despite a 6 1⁄2-game lead with 12 games to play, the Phillies lost 10 in 
a row and finished one game behind the St. Louis Cardinals. Manager Gene 
Mauch was criticized for his handling of the pitching staff over the final 
two weeks, but players such as slugging rookie third baseman Richie Allen 
also drew harsh treatment. Callison was 12-for-48 during the last 12 games, 
including a 3-homer game on September 27 against the Milwaukee Braves which 
the Phillies still lost 14–8, dropping them out of first place for the 
first time since July. With the Phillies behind by two on September 29, 
Callison did not start because he had the flu with chills and fever. However, 
Callison pinch-hit late in the game and managed a single. He reached first 
base and would not come out, so the Cardinals and the umpires allowed him 
to wear his Phillies jacket on the base paths, against MLB rules; due to 
his high fever, Callison needed help from Bill White to button his jacket.[3] 
Despite the disappointing second-place finish for Philadelphia, Callison 
ended the year third in the league in HRs (31) and fifth in runs batted 
in (104). He earned two first-place votes for the MVP Award, won by Ken 
Boyer of the World Series champion Cardinals. In the 1964 All-Star Game 
at Shea Stadium in New York on July 7, Callison hit a game-winning walk-off 
home run off pitcher Dick Radatz with two out in the ninth inning, a three-run 
shot to right field to give the NL a 7–4 victory; it was only the third 
walk-off HR in All-Star history, with Callison joining legends Ted Williams 
and Stan Musial in baseball annals.[4] In 1965, Callison again led the 
NL with a career-high 16 triples, once more topping 30 HRs and 100 RBI; 
on June 6, he hit three home runs against the Cubs and the Phillies won 
10-9. In 1966, he paced the league with 40 doubles. Callison also is remembered 
for being an excellent outfielder with a formidable throwing arm. He led 
the NL in fielding average as a right fielder in 1963 and 1964, and his 
throwing accuracy helped him lead the NL in outfield assists (24) and double 
plays (7) in 1962 and he topped the league in assists the next three years 
with totals of 26, 19, and 21. But his power production fell off sharply, 
and he failed to collect 20 homers or 65 RBI in any of his last four Phillies 
seasons. After the 1969 season, he was traded to the Cubs, and he posted 
1970 totals of 19 HRs and 68 RBI before hitting only .210 in 1971 with 
just 8 home runs. In January 1972 he was traded to the New York Yankees, 
and he found limited playing time over two years, closing his career with 
a .176 average, one HR and 10 RBI in 45 games in 1973. Callison was a career 
.264 hitter with 226 home runs, 926 runs, 840 RBI, 1757 hits, 321 doubles, 
89 triples, and 74 stolen bases in 1886 games. Following his retirement, 
Callison remained in Philadelphia where he made frequent appearances and 
had several business ventures. A resident of Glenside, a northern suburb
