The 2010 Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team represented the University of 
Arkansas in baseball at the Division I level in the NCAA for the 2010 season. 
Dave van Horn, a former Razorback player, was the coach in his sixth year 
at his alma mater.[1] The 2010 club hosted and won the Fayetteville Regional, 
but fell in the Tempe Super Regional to the top-seeded Arizona State Sun 
Devils.[2] The team was led by two All-Americans, Brett Eibner and Zack 
Cox. The Razorbacks return several key members of the 2009 Arkansas Razorbacks 
baseball team that went to the 2009 College World Series. A key returner 
is Andy Wilkins, who was named the Norman Regional Most Outstanding Player. 
The first baseman Wilkins brings a team-high .319 average to the table, 
also chipping in 19 home runs and 58 RBI in 2009. Freshman All-American 
Zack Cox returns to play third base for the Razorbacks. He hit .266 with 
39 RBI and freshman school record 13 home runs. Center fielder Brett Eibner, 
a native of The Woodlands, Texas, also brings power with 12 long balls 
and 34 RBI. Eibner also returns as a pitcher, going 5–5 in 17 games with 
a 5.00 ERA. Senior pitcher Mike Bolsinger returns from the bullpen, bringing 
a great slider and 2.99 ERA to the Razorbacks. Source: Baseball – 2010 
Coaches The Razorbacks began the 2010 campaign on February 19 with a 10–2 
victory over the Ball State Cardinals. Hogs starter Mike Bolsinger earned 
the win, and Andy Wilkins provided two hits, 2 RBI, and a solo home run. 
Every Razorback starting player recorded at least a base hit in the contest.[3] 
It was a different story in game two, however, as Ball State took a lead 
in the first inning and did not relinquish it. Geoffrey Davenport would 
continue after the shaky start to pitch effectively for four innings, including 
striking out the side in the fourth. The Razorbacks left twelve runners 
on base, and committed four defensive errors.[4] Game three was initially 
delayed fifteen minutes due to rain, but once the game started, Brett Eibner 
and Drew Smyly pitched well. Designated hitter Monk Kreder, a junior college 
transfer native to Keller, Texas, collected three hits. Six different Razorbacks 
scored in the 9–3 victory.[5] Andy Wilkins, James McCann, and Brett Eibner 
all went deep in game one of a three game series against the Troy Trojans. 
Zack Cox was 2–2 with one RBI and two runs scored as the Razorbacks prevailed 
10–1.[6] Wilkins, Eibner, and Cox would hit home runs in game two, as the 
No. 16 Diamond Hogs took a 10–8 slugfest. Redshirt sophomore Drew Smyly 
started the game, Jeremy Heatley earned the win, and DJ Baxendale, the 
Arkansas Gatorade Player of the Year as a high school senior, earned his 
first career save.[7] The Razorbacks started game three with seven runs 
in the first two innings, but then the bats fell silent. Troy posted six 
runs, but the Trojans couldn't complete the comeback and lost 7–6.[8] Arkansas 
hosted the No. 25 Kansas Jayhawks at Baum Stadium on March 2. The Razorback 
offense exploded, with Jarrod McKinney and Monk Kreder both leaving the 
yard for the first times in their careers. TJ Forrest began the game for 
the Hogs, and Geoffrey Davenport earned the win in relief.[9] In the year 
previous, the Hogs took two of three home games from Cal. This year, the 
Razorbacks would travel to Evans Diamond in Berkeley, California for the 
first time ever to take on the No. 22 California Golden Bears.[10] Game 
one featured a five-run eighth inning for the Razorbacks, including a three-run 
home run by James McCann. Mike Bolsinger went seven innings (his longest 
outing) to earn the win.[11] The subsequent day, Fayetteville-native Tim 
Carver hit two home runs, the first two of his career. Zack Cox going 3 
for 4 with 2 RBI, combined with Carver's power, propelled the Hogs to a 
9–5 victory.[12] Game three was not as kind to the visiting Hogs, as three 
errors and eight men left on base would prove vital in a 6–0 loss.[13] 
The loss snapped the Razorbacks' seven-game winning streak, the University's 
longest since 2006.[12] The South Dakota State Jackrabbits began the 2010 
season on a 27-game road trip, including two games in Fayetteville against 
the No. 14 Razorbacks.[14] Game one against the Jackrabbits produced a 
disappointing 3–2 loss for the Razorbacks. The Diamond Hogs loaded the 
bases with no outs in the final frame, but only pushed across one run. 
Collin Kuhn stole three bases in the loss.[15] The Razorbacks would exact 
revenge the following day, scoring twenty one runs. Bo Bigham went 3 for 
5 with 4 RBI, with home runs coming from Collin Kuhn and Zack Cox. Seven 
Razorbacks had 2+ hits, and six posted one or more RBI.[16] Entering the 
series against Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Collin Kuhn had reached base in all 
twelve games, and leads the team with a .395 batting average. The Razorbacks' 
17 team home runs leads the SEC.[17] The Razorbacks used eight runs in 
the seventh inning to rally past the Panthers. The game featured catcher 
James McCann hitting a grand slam and Zack Cox's hitting streak extending 
to thirteen games.[18] Game two belonged to Drew Smyly, as the Little Rock 
native struck out 11 in seven innings, walked two, and giving up four hits. 
Offensively, Collin Kuhn and Andy Wilkins both homered in the 7–0 victory.[19] 
The Razorback offense would produce plenty of drama in game three, turning 
a two-run deficit in the ninth inning into a tenth inning walk-off home 
run courtsey Matt Vinson.[20] The Alma, Arkansas native would earn SEC 
Player of the Week honors for his efforts against Wisconsin–Milwaukee,[21] 
the alma mater of legendary Razorback baseball coach Norm DeBriyn.[22] 
The highly anticipated series began March 19 at Alex Box Stadium. It was 
carried on Cox Sports Television.[23] Arkansas took game one, 6–3, behind 
Brett Eibner's two home runs and a strong seven inning pitching performance 
from Mike Bolsinger.[24] In game two, Arkansas gave up a four-run lead 
in the seventh inning to lose 7–8. Collin Kuhn had four RBI and a home 
run, and Zack Cox also left the yard.[25] Game three went to the Bengal 
Tigers by a 5–1 final, with Eibner's solo shot providing the only run for 
the Hogs.[26] Arkansas' road trip through Louisiana continued to Lake Charles, 
where the Hogs took on McNeese State University. TJ Forrest, a Louisiana 
native and LSU transfer, picked up the win in relief. Monk Kreder's RBI 
single in the sixth inning would prove the game winner, as the Razorbacks 
took a 3–2 win.[27] Game two also went to the Razorbacks, by a score of 
7–6. Matt Reynolds hit his first home run as a Razorback, and Zack Cox 
extended his hitting streak to 20 games. Razorback pitchers struck out 
fourteen Cowboys in the contest.[28] The Razorbacks, ranked as high as 
15, took on the No. 16 Alabama Crimson Tide in Baum Stadium for their SEC 
home opener. Arkansas scored four runs in the eighth inning of game one, 
leading to a 9–8 victory.[29] Game two also ended in a Razorback comeback. 
The Hogs, down 3–0 in the seventh inning, got a big hit from pinch hitter 
Thomas Hauskey. The senior catcher stepped to the plate with a runner on 
second base and two outs in the bottom of the ninth, and delivered a clutch 
RBI single to win the game.[30] Collin Kuhn, Zack Cox, Andy Wilkins and 
Brett Eibner each hit home runs in game three to give the Hogs a 10–5 win.[31] 
The sweep was the first of Alabama since 2006. Arkansas mauled Centenary 
in game one, scoring thirteen runs in the fourth and fifth innings on the 
way to an 18–2 win.[32] Bo Bigham and Matt Vinson both recorded three hits 
apiece, with Andy Wilkins recording 4 RBI and Kyle Robinson chipping in 
three more RBI.[33] Centenary led by as many as four runs in game two, 
but Wilkins, James McCann and Bigham each hit RBI doubles in the sixth 
inning to take control.[34] The win gives Arkansas another seven-game winning 
streak to close out March. Entering April, Arkansas is led at the plate 
by Zack Cox, who is hitting at a .414 clip. Andy Wilkins leads in home 
runs with 10, followed by Brett Eibner with 7. Wilkins also leads in RBI 
with 34, and total bases with 69. Drew Smyly leads the starters with a 
1.69 earned run average (ERA) over 26⅔ innings. Dual threat Eibner is second 
with a 2.28 ERA.[35] Arkansas' 3.24 team ERA is the second-best in the 
SEC (behind Vanderbilt).[36] The No. 18 Kentucky Wildcats baseball team 
came to Baum Stadium for a three game series, starting April 2. In game 
one, Braden Kapteyn of Kentucky hit a two-run home run in the first inning, 
and the Wildcats went on to win 12–8.[37] Mike Bolsinger lasted only 2⅓ 
innings, and the Hogs' seven-game winning streak came to an end. Arkansas 
would collect seventeen hits in game two, with Drew Smyly pitching seven 
innings of one-run baseball, as the Razorbacks won 10–1.[38] Collin Kuhn, 
Zack Cox, Brett Eibner, Tim Carver and James McCann all had multiple hits 
in game two.[39] Andy Wilkins would leave the game due to a hamstring injury. 
Game three, played on Easter Sunday, began with the Wildcats jumping out 
to five-run lead to start the game. In the bottom of the second, Razorbacks 
catcher James McCann powered a three-run homer over the fence, and coupled 
with some Kentucky miscues, the Razorbacks took an 8–5 lead. The UK offense 
would strike again for seven runs in the seventh off of Razorback reliever 
DJ Baxendale to make it 16–13 Wildcat lead. In the ninth, Jarrod McKinney 
drew a walk, followed by a McCann singe and Andy Wilkins pinch-hit walk. 
Collin Kuhn was due up, and with two outs and two strikes, Kuhn took the 
pitch from Matt Little over the left field fence for a walk-off grand slam.[40] 
The 17–16 final capped a very offensive weekend for the Hogs, including 
35 runs and 48 hits. Arkansas scored fourteen runs, a school record, in 
the first inning, and won easily, 32–8, in seven innings.[41] The Razorbacks 
first twelve batters reached base before the Billikens recorded an out. 
Collin Kuhn, Kyle Atkins, Bo Bigham, Zack Cox, Derrick Bleeker, Matt Vinson, 
Monk Kreder, Travis Sample, Tim Carver, Kyle Robinson, and Tom Hauskey 
all had multiple hits for the Razorbacks, with home runs from Kuhn, Bigham, 
Brett Eibner, and Vinson.[42] Arkansas earned its first ever road sweep 
in Starkville when they took all three games from Mississippi State.[43] 
The Razorbacks won the first game of the series 8–3; which was also Van 
Horn's 300th win as the head coach of Arkansas.[44] The winning pitcher 
was Smyly bringing his record to 4–0 on the season.[45] Game two was placed 
Saturday afternoon and the Razorbacks picked up another win with a final 
score of 8–5.[46] The game also marked the 10th consecutive game with 10 
or more hits, the longest such streak since 2003.[46] The finale was a 
13–3 win for the Razorbacks.[43] It was also the 6th consecutive win for 
the team.[43] The series in Starkville concluded after three games with 
almost 20,000 total fans in attendance for the series. Arkansas hosted 
the No. 19 New Mexico Lobos for a midweek series at Baum Stadium. The series 
started off with an 11 inning game concluding in an Arkansas win.[47] The 
Razorbacks won the first game of the series on a walk-off hit by Hauskey, 
his second of the season.[47] Heatley was awarded the win, which brought 
his record to 4–0 on the season.[48] The second game of the series was 
also a one run win for the Razorbacks.[49] Arkansas won the second game 
of the series 5–4 in 9 inning[49] Kowalchuk improved to 3–0 on the season[50] 
Arkansas finished the New Mexico series with two wins to bring their win 
streak up to 8 consecutive games. Baum Stadium also saw almost 16,000 people 
in the stands for the two game midweek series.[48][50] The No. 7 Razorbacks 
swept the No. 25 Georgia Bulldogs. In game one, televised by ESPN2, Drew 
Smyly limited the Bulldogs to five hits with seven strikeouts and no walks 
as he went the distance.[51] He got ten runs of support from the Razorback 
offense, led by an Andy Wilkins home run in the first inning and Bo Bigham, 
who reached base five times.[52] Game two was another 10–2 win for the 
Razorbacks behind a strong seven-inning outing by Brett Eibner.[53] The 
junior from Houston also had four RBI to help his cause. Collin Kuhn went 
4 for 5 at the plate, falling a home run short of the cycle.[54] The Razorback 
offense continued to excel in game three. Freshman Monk Kreder hit his 
second longball of the year, and Brett Eibner made a fine catch in the 
second inning to save some Georgia runs. At the conclusion of the Georgia 
series, Arkansas has won eleven straight games. Arkansas won its twelfth 
straight game, 9–5 over the Oral Roberts Golden Eagles. The Razorback offense 
was led by Brett Eibner, who hit two home runs.[55] Jeremy Heatley moved 
to 5–0 after earning the win.[56] Sixth-ranked Arkansas traveled to McKethan 
Stadium for a top-ten SEC showdown with No. 4 Florida. The Hogs beat the 
Gators five times in 2009.[57] The Razorbacks got home runs from Travis 
Sample, Bo Bigham and Collin Kuhn, plus ten strikeouts from Drew Smyly 
to win 8–3.[58] Brett Eibner started game two, but the Gators got six runs 
in the sixth inning, propelling them to an 8–2 victory.[59] The loss ended 
the Razorbacks' 13-game winning streak, the program's longest since 1996. 
Game three was tied 1–1 before Gator freshman Mike Zunino recorded a base 
hit in the ninth inning that scored Brian Johnson. This walk-off win gave 
the No. 4 Gators the series.[60] Brett Eibner hit his fourteenth home run, 
and the Razorbacks defeated Missouri State, 5–4, with Harrison-native Jordan 
Pratt earning the win out of the bullpen.[61] The Hogs used six pitchers 
in the game.[62] Arkansas hosted the No. 20 Auburn Tigers in a weekend 
series at Baum Stadium.[63] The Tigers after losing the first game went 
on to win the next meetings to win the series.[63] The Razorbacks won the 
first game of the series 9–4 by overcoming a four run deficit.[64] Smyly 
won the first game of the series to improve his record to 7–0.[65] The 
first game saw an attendance of over 7,200. Game two was won by Auburn 
by a score of 8–7.[66] Arkansas was trailing by 4 going into the bottom 
of the seventh and brought it down to 2 going into the ninth, but finally 
lost by one.[66] Fant took his first loss of the season. The attendance 
was nearly 9,000 for the Saturday afternoon game.[66] The finale was the 
most disappointing of the three game series. They lost by the score of 
13–2.[67] For the tenth time this season Zack Cox had a three hit game, 
but his performance only produced one RBI.[68] Eibner recorded his fourth 
loss on the season.[68] Similar to the Saturday game the last game of the 
series saw over 8,000 fans attend the game Sunday afternoon.[69] Rivals 
No. 10 Arkansas and No. 11 Ole Miss met for a crucial three-game series 
at Swayze Field. In game one, Arkansas got home runs from Tim Carver and 
Brett Eibner, plus a grand slam from Travis Sample. Zack Cox went 3 for 
3 (his 30th multi-hit game in 2010) as the Hogs rolled, 11–4.[70] Ole Miss 
scored three runs in the first two innings, and despite solo shots from 
Zack Cox and Tom Hauskey, the Rebels took a 3–2 final.[71] Game three belonged 
to Mike Bolsinger, as the senior pitcher went eight innings with giving 
up only two hits and striking out eleven. Andy Wilkins had 3 RBI as the 
Hogs won 7–0.[72] Collin Kuhn broke the single-season school hit by pitch 
record in game three. He has been hit 23 times. With the win, Arkansas 
took control of the SEC Western division. Arkansas played the Louisiana 
Tech Bulldogs at Dickey-Stephens Park (home of the Arkansas Travelers). 
Brett Eibner went 3 for 4, but it was Andy Wilkins that delivered the game 
winner in the bottom of the tenth. Tech began the game with a four-run 
second inning, but the Razorbacks battled back and tied the game on an 
Eibner single to left. Tied at 4–4, Zack Cox reached on a fielder's choice 
in the tenth inning, and Wilkins singled, giving the Hogs a 5–4 win.[73] 
Leaders of the SEC East and West met in Fayetteville for an SEC showdown. 
Arkansas was held to three hits by South Carolina in game one, as they 
lost 3–2.[74] Sam Dyson pitched a complete game shutout for the Gamecocks 
in two. The Razorbacks left ten runners on base.[75] Arkansas blew an eighth 
inning lead in game three, losing 5–3.[76] Collin Kuhn had his 24th multi-hit 
game, but it wasn't enough as the Razorbacks lost to Oklahoma 5–2. Arkansas 
starter Randall Fant was tagged with the loss.[77] Arkansas finished second 
behind Auburn in the SEC Western Division. The Hogs ranked fourth in team 
batting in the SEC with a .308 batting average. The Razorback pitchers 
had a 3.88 cumulative ERA, the third-best in the SEC. Zack Cox was the 
SEC batting champ, hitting .432. He also had 8 home runs and 47 RBI. The 
Louisville, Kentucky native was second in total hits with 92, and third 
in runs scored with 60. Cox broke the school record for hits in game two 
against South Carolina.[76] Brett Eibner finished third in home runs with 
18. Collin Kuhn was fifth in the SEC in total bases with 136. Drew Smyly 
posted a 2.58 ERA on the year, the third-best mark in the conference. The 
Little Rock native also recorded 92 strikeouts in 83⅔ innings, the fourth 
highest total in the Southeastern Conference.[78] The 2010 SEC Baseball 
Tournament began May 26 at Regions Park in Hoover, Alabama. Arkansas was 
the fourth overall seed, and first played Vanderbilt, who was the fifth 
seed.[79] Arkansas pitcher Jeremy Heatley, making his first collegiate 
start, pitched five shutout innings, but the Razorback offense struggled 
against Sonny Gray. Vanderbilt won 2–0.[80] This means that the Razorbacks 
were matched up with top-seed Florida the next day in an elimination game.[81] 
Gator starter Alex Panteliodis retired the first eleven Razorback hitters, 
and a late Razorbacks rally fell short, 5–4.[82] Despite losing 10 of their 
last 15 games, the Arkansas Razorbacks were named regional hosts. The winner 
of the Fayetteville Regional will play in the Tempe Super Regional. Arkansas 
joins Grambling State, Kansas State, and Washington State. The Hogs opened 
by defeating Grambling on June 4, 19–7.[83] The Razorbacks hit a school 
record nine home runs as a team, with Brett Eibner going 4 for 5 with 3 
HR and 7 RBI.[84] Collin Kuhn, James McCann and Andy Wilkins hit two home 
runs each in the contest.[84] Washington State defeated Kansas State, 8–6.[85]
