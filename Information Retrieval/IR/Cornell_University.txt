Cornell University (/kɔːrˈnɛl/ kor-NEL) is an American private Ivy League 
and federal land-grant doctoral university located in Ithaca, New York. 
Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, the university 
was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge—from 
the classics to the sciences, and from the theoretical to the applied. 
These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's motto, 
a popular 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: "I would found an institution where 
any person can find instruction in any study."[1] The university is broadly 
organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions 
at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and division defining its 
own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university 
also administers two satellite medical campuses, one in New York City and 
one in Education City, Qatar. Cornell is one of three private land grant 
universities in the nation and the only one in New York.[note 1] Of its 
seven undergraduate colleges, three are state-supported statutory or contract 
colleges through the State University of New York (SUNY) system, including 
its agricultural and human ecology colleges. Of Cornell's graduate schools, 
only the veterinary college is state-supported. As a land grant college, 
Cornell operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county 
of New York and receives annual funding from the State of New York for 
certain educational missions.[7] The Cornell University Ithaca Campus comprises 
745 acres, but is much larger when the Cornell Plantations (more than 4,300 
acres) are considered, as well as the numerous university-owned lands in 
New York City.[8] Since its founding, Cornell has been a co-educational, 
non-sectarian institution where admission has not been restricted by religion 
or race. Cornell counts more than 245,000 living alumni, and its former 
and present faculty and alumni include 34 Marshall Scholars, 29 Rhodes 
Scholars, 7 Gates Scholars, 54 Nobel laureates, and 14 living billionaires.[9][10][11] 
The student body consists of nearly 14,000 undergraduate and 7,000 graduate 
students from all 50 American states and 122 countries.[12][13] Cornell 
University was founded on April 27, 1865; the New York State (NYS) Senate 
authorized the university as the state's land grant institution. Senator 
Ezra Cornell offered his farm in Ithaca, New York as a site and $500,000 
of his personal fortune as an initial endowment. Fellow senator and experienced 
educator Andrew Dickson White agreed to be the first president. During 
the next three years, White oversaw the construction of the first two buildings 
and traveled to attract students and faculty.[14] The university was inaugurated 
on October 7, 1868, and 412 men were enrolled the next day.[15] Cornell 
developed as a technologically innovative institution, applying its research 
to its own campus as well as to outreach efforts. For example, in 1883 
it was one of the first university campuses to use electricity from a water-powered 
dynamo to light the grounds.[16] Since 1894, Cornell has included colleges 
that are state funded and fulfill statutory requirements;[17] it has also 
administered research and extension activities that have been jointly funded 
by state and federal matching programs.[18] Cornell has had active alumni 
since its earliest classes. It was one of the first universities to include 
alumni-elected representatives on its Board of Trustees.[note 2] Cornell 
was also among the Ivies that had heightened student activism during the 
1960s related to cultural issues, civil rights, and opposition to the Vietnam 
War; with protests and occupations resulting in the resignation of Cornell's 
president and the restructuring of university governance.[19] Today the 
university has more than 4,000 courses.[20] Since 2000, Cornell has been 
expanding its international programs. In 2004, the university opened the 
Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar.[21] It has partnerships with institutions 
in India, Singapore, and the People's Republic of China.[22][23][24] Former 
president Jeffrey S. Lehman described the university, with its high international 
profile, a "transnational university".[25] On March 9, 2004, Cornell and 
Stanford University laid the cornerstone for a new 'Bridging the Rift Center' 
to be built and jointly operated for education on the Israel–Jordan border.[26] 
Cornell's main campus is on East Hill in Ithaca, New York, overlooking 
the town and Cayuga Lake. Since the university was founded, it has expanded 
to about 2300 acres (9.3 km2), encompassing both the hill and much of the 
surrounding areas.[27] Central Campus has laboratories, administrative 
buildings, and almost all of the campus' academic buildings, athletic facilities, 
auditoriums, and museums. Collegetown contains two upper-class residence 
halls[28][29] and the Schwartz Performing Arts Center amid a mixed-use 
neighborhood of apartments, eateries, and businesses.[30] The main campus 
is marked by an irregular layout and eclectic architectural styles, including 
ornate Collegiate Gothic, Victorian, and Neoclassical buildings, and the 
more spare international and modernist structures. The more ornate buildings 
generally predate World War II. The student population doubled from 7,000 
in 1950 to 15,000 by 1970, at a time when architectural styles favored 
modernism.[31] While some buildings are neatly arranged into quadrangles, 
others are packed densely and haphazardly. These eccentricities arose from 
the university's numerous, ever-changing master plans for the campus. For 
example, in one of the earliest plans, Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer 
of Central Park, proposed a "grand terrace" overlooking Cayuga Lake.[32] 
Several of the university buildings are listed on the National Register 
of Historic Places, including the Andrew Dickson White House, Bailey Hall, 
Caldwell Hall, Comstock Hall, Morrill Hall (Cornell University), and Deke 
House. At least three other historic buildings—the original Roberts Hall, 
East Robert Hall and Stone Hall—have also been listed on the NRHP. The 
university demolished them in the 1980s to make way for other development.[33] 
In September 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the Ithaca Campus as among the 
most beautiful in the United States.[34] Located among the rolling valleys 
of the Finger Lakes region, the campus on a hill provides views of the 
surrounding area, including 38 miles (61.4 km) long Lake Cayuga. Two gorges, 
Fall Creek Gorge and Cascadilla Gorge, bound Central Campus and are used 
as popular swimming holes during the warmer months (although the university 
and city code discourage their use).[35] Adjacent to the main campus, Cornell 
owns the 2,800 acre (11.6 km2) Cornell Plantations, a botanical garden 
containing flowers, trees, and ponds, with manicured trails providing access 
through the facility.[36] The university has embarked on numerous 'green' 
initiatives. In 2009, a new gas-fired combined heat and power facility 
replaced a coal-fired steam plant, resulting in a reduction in carbon emissions 
to 7% below 1990 levels, and projected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 
by 75,000 tons per year.[37] This facility satisfies 15% of campus electrical 
needs,[38] and a university-run, on-campus hydroelectric plant in the Fall 
Creek Gorge provides an additional 2%.[39] The university has a lake source 
cooling project that uses Lake Cayuga to air condition campus buildings, 
with an 80% energy saving over conventional systems.[40] In 2007, Cornell 
established a Center for a Sustainable Future.[41] Cornell has been rated 
"A-" by the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card for its environmental 
and sustainability initiatives.[42] Cornell's medical campus in New York, 
also called Weill Cornell, is on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New 
York City. It is home to two Cornell divisions, Weill Cornell Medical College 
and Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, and has been affiliated 
with the NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital since 1927.[43] Although their faculty 
and academic divisions are separate, the Medical Center shares its administrative 
and teaching hospital functions with the Columbia University Medical Center.[44] 
These teaching hospitals include the Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan 
and the Westchester Division in White Plains, New York.[45] Weill Cornell 
Medical College is also affiliated with the neighboring Memorial Sloan–Kettering 
Cancer Center, Rockefeller University, and the Hospital for Special Surgery. 
Many faculty members have joint appointments at these institutions. Weill 
Cornell, Rockefeller, and Memorial Sloan–Kettering offer the Tri-Institutional 
MD–PhD Program to selected entering Cornell medical students.[46] From 
1942 to 1979, the campus also housed a Cornell school of nursing.[47] On 
December 19, 2011, Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute of 
Technology won a competition for rights to claim free city land as well 
as $100 million in subsidies to build an engineering campus in New York 
City. The competition was established by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg 
in order to increase entrepreneurship and job growth in the city's technology 
sector. The winning bid consisted of a 2.1 million square feet state-of-the-art 
tech campus to be built on Roosevelt Island on the site of the former Coler-Goldwater 
Specialty Hospital. Instruction began in the fall of 2012 in a temporary 
location in Manhattan (111 Eighth Avenue in space donated by Google).[48] 
Thom Mayne of the architecture firm Morphosis has been selected to design 
the first building to be constructed on Roosevelt Island. Begun in 2014, 
construction is expected to be completed for the fall start of the 2017 
academic year.[49] In addition to the tech campus and medical center, Cornell 
maintains local offices in New York City for some of its service programs. 
The Cornell Urban Scholars Program encourages students to pursue public 
service careers, arranging assignments with organizations working with 
New York City's poorest children, families, and communities.[50] The NYS 
College of Human Ecology and the NYS College of Agriculture and Life Sciences 
enable students to reach out to local communities by gardening and building 
with the Cornell Cooperative Extension.[51] Students with the NYS School 
of Industrial and Labor Relations' Extension & Outreach Program make workplace 
expertise available to organizations, union members, policy makers, and 
working adults.[52] The College of Engineering's Operations Research Manhattan, 
in the city's financial district, brings together business optimization 
research and decision support services addressed to both financial applications 
and public health logistics planning.[53] The College of Architecture, 
Art, and Planning has a 11,000 square foot Gensler-designed facility in 
26 Broadway (The Standard Oil Building) in the Financial District that 
opened in 2015.[54] Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar is in Education 
City, near Doha. Opened in September 2004, this is the first American medical 
school to be established outside the United States. The college is part 
of Cornell's program to increase its international influence. The college 
is a joint initiative with the Qatar government, which seeks to improve 
the country's academic programs and medical care.[21] Along with its full 
four-year MD program, which mirrors the curriculum taught at Weill Medical 
College in New York City, the college offers a two-year undergraduate pre-medical 
program with a separate admissions process. This undergraduate program 
opened in September 2002 and was the first coeducational institute of higher 
education in Qatar.[55] The college is partially funded by the Qatar government 
through the Qatar Foundation, which contributed $750 million for its construction.[56] 
The medical center is housed in a large two-story structure designed by 
Arata Isozaki, an internationally known Japanese architect.[57] In 2004, 
the Qatar Foundation announced the construction of a 350-bed Specialty 
Teaching Hospital near the medical college in Education City. The hospital 
was to be completed in a few years.[21] Cornell University owns and/or 
operates other facilities.[58] The Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, 
site of the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, was operated by 
Cornell under a contract with the National Science Foundation from its 
construction until 2011.[59] The Shoals Marine Laboratory, operated in 
conjunction with the University of New Hampshire,[60] is a seasonal marine 
field station dedicated to undergraduate education and research on the 
95-acre (0.4 km2) Appledore Island off the Maine–New Hampshire coast.[61] 
Cornell has facilities devoted to conservation and ecology. The New York 
State Agricultural Experiment Station, operated by the College of Agriculture 
and Life Sciences, is in Geneva, New York, 50 miles (80 km) northwest of 
the main campus. It operates three substations: The Cornell Lake Erie Research 
and Extension Laboratory (CLEREL) in Portland, New York,[62] Hudson Valley 
Laboratory in Highland,[63] and the Long Island Horticultural Research 
Laboratory in Riverhead.[64] The Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca's 
Sapsucker Woods performs research on biological diversity, primarily in 
birds.[65] On April 18, 2005, the lab announced that it had rediscovered 
the ivory-billed woodpecker, long thought to be extinct (Some experts disputed 
the evidence and subsequent surveys were inconclusive).[66] The Animal 
Science Teaching and Research Center in Harford, New York, and the Duck 
Research Laboratory in Eastport, New York, are resources for information 
on animal disease control and husbandry.[67][68] The Cornell Biological 
Field Station in Bridgeport, New York, conducts long-term ecological research 
and supports the university's educational programs, with special emphasis 
on freshwater lake systems.[69] The Department of Horticulture operates 
the Freeville Organic Research Farm and Homer C. Thompson Vegetable Research 
Farm in Freeville, New York.[9] The university operates biodiversity laboratories 
in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic,[70] and one in the Peruvian Amazon Rainforest 
(Cornell University Esbaran Amazon Field Laboratory).[71] The university 
arranges study abroad and scholarship programs. The Cornell in Washington 
is a program that allows students to study for a semester in Washington, 
D.C., holding research or internship positions while earning credit toward 
a degree.[72] Cornell in Rome, operated by the College of Architecture, 
Art, and Planning, allows students to use the city as a resource for learning 
architecture, urban studies, and art.[73] Similarly, the Capital Semester 
program allows students to intern in the New York state legislature in 
Albany. As New York State's land grant college, Cornell operates a cooperative 
extension service with 56 offices spread out across the state, each staffed 
with extension educators who offer programs in five subjects: Agriculture 
and Food Systems; Children, Youth, and Families; Community and Economic 
Vitality; Environment and Natural Resources; and Nutrition and Health.[74] 
Cornell also operates New York's Animal Health Diagnostic Center.[75] Cornell 
is a non-profit organization governed by a 64-member board of trustees 
consisting of both privately and publicly appointed trustees. Three trustees 
are appointed by the Governor of New York; one seat is reserved for the 
eldest lineal descendant of Ezra Cornell; two members from each of the 
fields of agriculture, business and labor in New York state; eight trustees 
to be elected from among and by the alumni of the university; two trustees 
to be elected from among and by the faculty of the university at Ithaca 
and Geneva; two trustees to be elected from among and by the membership 
of the university's student body at Ithaca (one undergraduate and one graduate 
student);[76] and one trustee to be elected from among and by the nonacademic 
staff and employees of the university at Ithaca and Geneva, 37 trustees 
at large and finally, the Governor, Temporary President of the Senate, 
Speaker of the Assembly, and president of the university serve in an ex 
officio voting capacity.[77][78] Robert Harrison has served as the chairman 
of the board since 2014.[79] The board elects a President to serve as the 
chief executive and educational officer.[77] Succeeding David J. Skorton, 
the thirteenth president, Elizabeth Garrett, served from July 2015 until 
her death from colon cancer on March 6, 2016—the first Cornell president 
to die while in office.[80][81] The Board of Trustees hold four regular 
meetings each year, and portions of those meetings are subject to the New 
York State Open Meetings Law.[82] Cornell consists of nine privately endowed 
colleges as well as four publicly supported "statutory colleges": the New 
York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, College of Human Ecology, 
School of Industrial and Labor Relations, and College of Veterinary Medicine. 
These statutory colleges received $131.9 million in SUNY appropriations 
in 2010-2011 to support their teaching, research, and service missions, 
which makes them accountable to SUNY trustees and other state agencies. 
The budget also includes $3.9 million of state funds for Cornell Cooperative 
Extension.[83][84][85] Residents of New York enrolled in these colleges 
also qualify for discounted tuition.[86] However, Attorney General Eliot 
Spitzer issued a 2005 opinion asserting that, with respect to their academic 
activities, statutory colleges should be understood to be private, non-state 
parties.[7]:1 Cornell is decentralized, with its colleges and schools exercising 
wide autonomy. Each defines its own academic programs, operates its own 
admissions and advising programs, and confers its own degrees. The only 
university-wide requirements for a baccalaureate degree are to pass a swimming 
test, take two physical education courses, and satisfy a writing requirement.[87] 
A handful of inter-school academic departments offer courses in more than 
one college.[88][89] All academic departments are affiliated with at least 
one college; the last department without such an affiliation, the Cornell 
Africana Studies and Research Center, merged with the Arts College in July 
2011.[90] Seven schools provide undergraduate programs and an additional 
seven provide graduate and professional programs. Students pursuing graduate 
degrees in departments of these schools are enrolled in the Graduate School. 
The School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions offers programs 
for college and high school students, professionals, and other adults.[91] 
Of the 13,515 undergraduate students, 4,251 (31.5%) are affiliated with 
the largest college by enrollment, Arts and Sciences, followed by 3,153 
(23.3%) in Agriculture and Life Sciences and 2,680 (19.8%) in Engineering. 
By student enrollment, the smallest of the seven undergraduate colleges 
is Architecture, Art, and Planning, with 515 (3.8%) students.[9] Several 
other universities have used Cornell as their model, including Stanford 
University, the University of Sydney in Australia, and the University of 
Birmingham in the United Kingdom; the latter on the recommendation of one 
of its financiers, Andrew Carnegie, who was a Cornell Trustee.[92] The 
university also operates eCornell, which offers both certificate programs 
and professional development courses online.[93] In addition to being New 
York's land-grant college, Cornell is also a partner in New York's sea-grant 
program,[94] is the hub of the Northeast's sun-grant program,[95] and is 
a part of New York's space-grant consortium.[96] In 2015, Cornell ranked 
fifth among universities in the U.S. in fund-raising, collecting $591 million 
in private support.[97] In addition to the central University development 
staff located in Ithaca and New York City, each college and program has 
its own staffed fundraising program. In 2006, Cornell launched a $4 billion 
fundraising campaign, which reached $3 billion in November 2010.[98] In 
2013, Cornell's "Cornell Now" fundraising campaign raised over $475 million.[99] 
Cornell is a large, primarily residential research university with a majority 
of enrollments in undergraduate programs.[100] The university has been 
accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education since 1921.[101] 
Cornell operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall term beginning 
in late August and ending in early December, a three-week winter session 
in January, and the spring term beginning in late January and ending in 
early May.[102] Cornell and Oregon State University are the only two institutions 
which are members of the Land Grant, Sea Grant, Space Grant, and Sun Grant 
programs. Admission to the university is very competitive. For Fall 2016, 
Cornell received 44,966 freshmen applications; 6277 were admitted (13.96% 
acceptance rate).[103] The middle 50% range of SAT scores were 650-750 
for critical reading, and 680-780 for math.[103] The middle 50% range of 
the ACT Composite score was 30-34.[103] Cornell enrolls students from all 
50 U.S. states and more than 120 countries. As of Fall 2014, 25.7% of undergraduate 
students identified themselves as members of ethnic minority groups.[9] 
Legacy applicants receive a slight advantage in the admission process.[104] 
In 2013, the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management accepted 
21% of its applicants for its two-year MBA program.[105] Section 9 of the 
original charter of Cornell University ensured that the university "shall 
be open to applicants for admission ... at the lowest rates of expense 
consistent with its welfare and efficiency, and without distinction as 
to rank, class, previous occupation or locality."[106] The University Charter 
provided for free instruction to one student chosen from each Assembly 
district in the state.[106] Starting in the 1950s Cornell coordinated with 
other Ivy League schools to provide a consistent set of financial aid. 
However, in 1989, a consent decree to end a Justice Department antitrust 
investigation ended such coordination.[107] Even after the decree, all 
Ivy League schools continue to award aid on financial need without offering 
any athletic scholarships.[108] In December 2010, Cornell announced a policy 
of matching any grant component of financial aid offers from other Ivy 
League schools, MIT, Duke University or Stanford, if an accepted applicant 
is trying to decide between Cornell and those other schools.[109] On January 
31, 2008, Cornell announced a new financial aid initiative to be phased 
in over the following two years. In the first year, 2008–09, Cornell replaced 
need-based loans with scholarships for undergraduate students from families 
with incomes under $60,000 and capped such loans annually at $3,000 for 
students from families with incomes between $60,000 and $120,000. The following 
year, 2009–10, the program improved by replacing loan with scholarships 
for students from families with incomes up to $75,000, and capped annual 
loans at $3,000 for students from families with income between $75,000 
and $120,000. For families above $120,000, need-based loans were capped 
at $7,500 per year.[110] The initiative costs an additional $14 million 
per year to fully implement.[111] Although Cornell's endowment dropped 
27% in the second half of 2008, its President announced that the financial 
aid initiative will continue by withdrawing an additional $35 million from 
the endowment for undergraduate financial aid in 2009-10.[112] Cornell 
is seeking $125 million in gifts to support the financial aid initiative.[113] 
In 2010, 1,647 of the 3,181 full-time freshmen enrolled were found to have 
financial need (40%).[114] Of these, Cornell could meet the full financial 
aid needs of all 1,647 freshmen. Cornell's average undergraduate student's 
indebtedness at graduation is $21,549.[114] Cornell offers undergraduate 
curricula with international focuses, including the Africana Studies, French 
Studies, German Studies, Jewish Studies, Latino Studies, Near Eastern Studies, 
Romance Studies, and Russian Literature majors.[9] In addition to traditional 
academic programs, Cornell students may study abroad on any of six continents.[115] 
The Asian Studies major, South Asia Program, South East Asia Program and 
China and Asia-Pacific Studies (CAPS) major provide opportunities for students 
and researchers in Asia. Cornell has an agreement with Peking University 
allowing students in the CAPS major to spend a semester in Beijing.[116] 
Similarly, the College of Engineering has an agreement to exchange faculty 
and graduate students with Tsinghua University in Beijing, and the School 
of Hotel Administration has a joint master's program with Nanyang Technological 
University in Singapore. The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences has 
signed an agreement with Japan's National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences,[117] 
as well as the University of the Philippines, Los Baños,[118] to engage 
in joint research and exchange graduate students and faculty members. It 
also cooperates in agricultural research with the Indian Council of Agricultural 
Research.[119] Cornell also offers a course on International consulting 
in association with Indian Institute of Management Bangalore[120] In the 
Middle East, Cornell's efforts focus on biology and medicine. The Weill 
Cornell Medical College in Qatar trains new doctors to improve health services 
in the region.[121] The university is also developing the Bridging the 
Rift Center, a "Library of Life" (or database of all living systems) on 
the border of Israel and Jordan, in collaboration with those two countries 
and Stanford University.[122] Cornell has partnered with Queen's University 
in Canada to offer a joint Executive MBA. The innovative program includes 
both on-campus and videoconferencing-based, interactive virtual classroom 
sessions. Graduates of the program earn both a Cornell MBA and a Queen's 
MBA.[123] Cornell University is member of the United Nations Academic Impact 
aligning institutions of higher education to the United Nations and promoting 
international cooperation. In 2015, Cornell ranked 8th domestically and 
10th internationally in the CWUR rankings.[132] For 2016-17, Cornell ranked 
16th in the QS World University Rankings and 19th in the Times Higher Education 
World University Rankings.[133][134] The university ranked 10th in the 
2013 Business Insider Best Colleges in America ranking,[135] 15th in the 
2016 U.S. News & World Report National Universities ranking,[136] and 13th 
globally in an academic ranking of world universities by Academic Ranking 
of World Universities in 2015.[137] Cornell was ranked 27th nationally 
in The Washington Monthly's 2016 ranking of universities' contributions 
to research, community service, and social mobility.[138] In its annual 
edition of "America's Best Architecture & Design Schools", the journal 
Design Intelligence has consistently ranked Cornell's Bachelor of Architecture 
program as number one in the nation (2000–2002, 2005–2007, 2009–2013 and 
2015-2016). In the 2011 survey, the program ranked first and the Master 
of Architecture program ranked sixth.[139] In 2011 and 2012, Design Intelligence 
ranked Cornell's Master of Landscape Architecture program 4th in the nation 
with the undergraduate program placing 8th for the same two years.[140][141] 
Among business schools in the United States, the Johnson School of Management 
at Cornell was named the No. 10 business school by Forbes in 2015,[142] 
8th by the Washington Post for salary potential, 14th overall by Poets 
and Quants[143] but ranked 4th for Investment Banking[144] and 6th for 
salary,[145] 16th by Bloomberg Businessweek in 2015,[146] and 15th by The 
Economist in 2015.[146] The Johnson school was ranked No. 2 by Bloomberg 
Businessweek[147] and a No. 6 ranking by the The Princeton Review's "Top 
50 Green Colleges".[148] Cornell's international relations offerings are 
also ranked in Foreign Policy magazine's Inside the Ivory Tower survey, 
which lists the world's top twenty of such programs at the undergraduate, 
Master's and Ph.D. levels.[149] In 2012, the survey ranked Cornell 11th 
overall for doctoral programs and 12th overall in the undergraduate category.[150] 
In 2015, Cornell University was ranked 3rd in New York State by average 
professor salaries.[151] The Cornell University Library is the 11th largest 
academic library in the United States, ranked by number of volumes held.[152] 
Organized into 20 divisions, in 2005 it held 7.5 million printed volumes 
in open stacks, 8.2 million microfilms and microfiches, and a total of 
440,000 maps, motion pictures, DVDs, sound recordings, and computer files 
in its collections, in addition to extensive digital resources and the 
University Archives.[153] It was the first among all U.S. colleges and 
universities to allow undergraduates to borrow books from its libraries.[9] 
In 2006, The Princeton Review ranked it as the 11th best college library,[154] 
and it climbed to 6th best in 2009.[155] The library plays an active role 
in furthering online archiving of scientific and historical documents. 
arXiv, an e-print archive created at Los Alamos National Laboratory by 
Paul Ginsparg, is operated and primarily funded by Cornell as part of the 
library's services. The archive has changed the way many physicists and 
mathematicians communicate, making the e-print a viable and popular means 
of announcing new research.[156] The Cornell University Press, established 
in 1869 but inactive from 1884 to 1930, was the first university publishing 
enterprise in the United States.[157][158] Today, the press is one of the 
country's largest university presses.[9] It produces approximately 150 
nonfiction titles each year in various disciplines including anthropology, 
Asian studies, biological sciences, classics, history, industrial relations, 
literary criticism and theory, natural history, philosophy, politics and 
international relations, veterinary science, and women's studies.[158][159] 
Cornell's academic units and student groups also publish a number of scholarly 
journals. Faculty-led publications include the Johnson School's Administrative 
Science Quarterly,[160] the ILR School's Industrial and Labor Relations 
Review, the Arts and Sciences Philosophy Department's The Philosophical 
Review, the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning's Journal of Architecture, 
and the Law School's Journal of Empirical Legal Studies.[161] Student-led 
scholarly publications include the Law Review, the Cornell Institute for 
Public Affairs' Cornell Policy Review, the International Law Journal, the 
Journal of Law and Public Policy, the International Affairs Review, and 
the HR Review. Physical Review, recognized internationally as among the 
best and well known journals of physics, was founded at Cornell in 1893 
before being later managed by the American Physical Society. Cornell, a 
research university, is ranked fourth in the world in producing the largest 
number of graduates who go on to pursue PhDs in engineering or the natural 
sciences at American institutions, as well as fifth in the world in producing 
graduates who pursue PhDs at American institutions in any field.[162] Research 
is a central element of the university's mission; in 2009 Cornell spent 
$671 million on science and engineering research and development, the 16th 
highest in the United States.[163] For the 2004–05 fiscal year, the university 
spent $561.3 million on research.[164] The primary recipients of this funding 
were the colleges of Medicine ($164.2 million), Agriculture and Life Sciences 
($114.5 million), Arts and Sciences ($80.3 million), and Engineering ($64.8 million).[164] 
The money comes largely from federal sources, with federal investment of 
$381.0 million. The federal agencies that invest the most money are the 
Department of Health and Human Services and the National Science Foundation 
that make up, respectively, 51.4% and 30.7% of all federal investment in 
the university.[164] Cornell was on the top-ten list of U.S. universities 
receiving the most patents in 2003, and was one of the nation's top five 
institutions in forming start-up companies.[165] In 2004–05, Cornell received 
200 invention disclosures, filed 203 U.S. patent applications, completed 
77 commercial license agreements, and distributed royalties of more than 
$4.1 million to Cornell units and inventors.[9] Since 1962, Cornell has 
been involved in unmanned missions to Mars.[166] In the 21st century, Cornell 
had a hand in the Mars Exploration Rover Mission. Cornell's Steve Squyres, 
Principal Investigator for the Athena Science Payload, led the selection 
of the landing zones and requested data collection features for the Spirit 
and Opportunity rovers.[167] Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineers took those 
requests and designed the rovers to meet them. The rovers, both of which 
have operated long past their original life expectancies, are responsible 
for the discoveries that were awarded 2004 Breakthrough of the Year honors 
by Science.[168] Control of the Mars rovers has shifted between NASA's 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech and Cornell's Space Sciences Building.[169] 
Further, Cornell researchers discovered the rings around the planet Uranus,[170] 
and Cornell built and operated the telescope at Arecibo Observatory located 
in Arecibo, Puerto Rico until 2011, when they transferred the operations 
to SRI International, the Universities Space Research Association and the 
Metropolitan University of Puerto Rico.[171] The Automotive Crash Injury 
Research Project was begun in 1952.[172] It pioneered the use of crash 
testing, originally using corpses rather than dummies. The project discovered 
that improved door locks, energy-absorbing steering wheels, padded dashboards, 
and seat belts could prevent an extraordinary percentage of injuries.[172] 
In the early 1980s, Cornell deployed the first IBM 3090-400VF and coupled 
two IBM 3090-600E systems to investigate coarse-grained parallel computing. 
In 1984, the National Science Foundation began work on establishing five 
new supercomputer centers, including the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing, 
to provide high-speed computing resources for research within the United 
States. As an NSF center, Cornell deployed the first IBM Scalable Parallel 
supercomputer. In the 1990s, Cornell developed scheduling software and 
deployed the first supercomputer built by Dell. Most recently, Cornell 
deployed Red Cloud, one of the first cloud computing services designed 
specifically for research. Today, the center is a partner on the National 
Science Foundation XSEDE supercomputing program, providing coordination 
for XSEDE architecture and design, systems reliability testing, and online 
training using the Cornell Virtual Workshop learning platform.[173] Cornell 
scientists have researched the fundamental particles of nature for more 
than 70 years. Cornell physicists, such as Hans Bethe, contributed not 
only to the foundations of nuclear physics but also participated in the 
Manhattan Project (see also: List of Cornell Manhattan Project people). 
In the 1930s, Cornell built the second cyclotron in the United States. 
In the 1950s, Cornell physicists became the first to study synchrotron 
radiation. During the 1990s, the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, located 
beneath Alumni Field, was the world's highest-luminosity electron-positron 
collider.[174][175] After building the synchrotron at Cornell, Robert R. 
Wilson took a leave of absence to become the founding director of Fermilab, 
which involved designing and building the largest accelerator in the United 
States.[176] Cornell's accelerator and high-energy physics groups are involved 
in the design of the proposed International Linear Collider and plan to 
participate in its construction and operation. The International Linear 
Collider, to be completed in the late 2010s, will complement the Large 
Hadron Collider and shed light on questions such as the identity of dark 
matter and the existence of extra dimensions.[177] In the area of humanities 
and social sciences, Cornell is best known for being one of the world's 
greatest centers for the study of Southeast Asia. The Southeast Asia Program 
(SEAP) at Cornell is designated as a National Resource Center (NRC) by 
the United States Department of Education 2010–2014. Therefore, the SEAP 
is nationally prominent in promoting advanced foreign language training, 
area and international knowledge in the liberal arts and applied discipline 
focused on Southeast Asia.[178] The George McTurnan Kahin Center for Advanced 
Research on Southeast Asia is located in the historic "Treman House."[179] 
The house was built by Robert Henry Treman, the son of an enterprising 
local family and the first member of that family to attend Cornell University 
and be elected to its board of trustees. The George McTurnan Kahin Center 
is home to SEAP graduate students, visiting fellows and scholars, faculty 
members, and SEAP's Publication and Outreach offices.[180] For the 2006–07 
academic year, Cornell had 901 registered student organizations. These 
clubs and organizations run the gamut from kayaking to full-armor jousting, 
from varsity and club sports and a cappella groups to improvisational theatre, 
from political clubs and publications to chess and video game clubs.[181] 
The Cornell International Affairs Society sends over 100 Cornellians to 
collegiate Model United Nations conferences across North America and hosts 
the Cornell Model United Nations Conference each spring for over 500 high 
school students. Additionally, the Cornell International Affairs Society's 
travelling Model United Nations team is ranked number 16 in the nation.[182] 
Cornell United Religious Work is a collaboration among many diverse religious 
traditions, helping to provide spiritual resources throughout a student's 
time at college. The Cornell Catholic Community is the largest Catholic 
student organization on campus, updated to Vatican II in 2004 by Mr. Jackson 
Browne. Mr. Browne, a quiet student of religious studies and known best 
for his relationship between the Provost and many Student organizations. 
Student organizations also include a myriad of groups including a symphony 
orchestra,[183] concert bands,[184] formal and informal choral groups,[185] 
including the Sherwoods and Cayuga's Waiters (a pun on the first line of 
the alma mater, "Far above Cayuga's waters . . . ") and other musical groups 
that play everything from classical, jazz, to ethnic styles in addition 
to the Big Red Marching Band, which performs regularly at football games 
and other campus events.[186] Organized in 1868, the oldest Cornell student 
organization is the Cornell University Glee Club.[187] A Cornell student 
organization, The Cornell Astronomical Society, runs public observing nights 
every Friday evening at the Fuertes Observatory. The university is home 
to the Telluride House, an intellectual residential society. The university 
is also home to three secret honor societies called Sphinx Head,[188] Der 
Hexenkreis and Quill and Dagger[189][190] that have maintained a presence 
on campus for well over 120 years. Cornell's clubs are primarily subsidized 
financially by the Student Assembly and the Graduate & Professional Student 
Assembly, two student-run organizations with a collective budget of $3.0 million 
per year.[191][192] The assemblies also finance other student life programs 
including a concert commission and an on-campus theater. Cornell hosts 
a large fraternity and sorority system, with 70 chapters involving 33% 
of male and 24% of female undergraduates.[193][194][195] Alpha Phi Alpha, 
the first intercollegiate Greek-letter organization established for African 
Americans, was founded at Cornell in 1906.[196][197] Alpha Zeta Fraternity, 
the first Greek-lettered organization established for Latin Americans in 
the United States, was also founded at Cornell on January 1, 1890. Alpha 
Zeta served the wealthy international Latin American students that came 
to the United States to study. This organization led a movement of fraternities 
that catered to international Latin American students that was active from 
1890 to 1975.[198] Cornell's connection to national Greek life is strong 
and longstanding. Many chapters are among the oldest of their respective 
national organizations, as evidenced by the proliferation of Alpha-series 
chapters. The chapter house of Alpha Delta Phi constructed in 1877 is believed 
to be the first house built in America solely for fraternity use.[199] 
Philanthropy opportunities are used to encourage community relations, for 
example, during the 2004–05 academic year, the Greek system contributed 
21,668 community service and advocacy hours and raised $176,547 in charitable 
contributions from its philanthropic efforts.[194] Generally, discipline 
is managed internally by the inter-Greek governing boards. As with all 
student, faculty or staff misconduct, more serious cases are reviewed by 
the Judicial Administrator, who administers Cornell's justice system.[194] 
The Cornell student body produces several works by way of print and radio. 
Student-run newspapers include The Cornell Daily Sun, an independent daily; 
The Cornell Review, a conservative newspaper published fortnightly; and 
The Cornell Progressive (newspaper), a liberal newspaper published every 
month. Other press outlets include The Cornell Lunatic, a campus humor 
magazine; the Cornell Chronicle, the university's newspaper of record; 
and Kitsch Magazine, a feature magazine published in cooperation with Ithaca 
College. The Cornellian is an independent student organization that organizes, 
arranges, produces, edits, and publishes the yearbook of the same name; 
it is composed of artistic photos of the campus, student life, and athletics, 
as well as the standard senior portraits. It carries the Silver Crown Award 
for Journalism as well as a Benjamin Franklin Award for Print Design – 
the only Ivy League Yearbook with such a distinction.[200] Cornellians 
are represented over the radio waves on WVBR, an independent commercial 
FM radio station owned and operated by Cornell students. Other student 
groups also operate internet streaming audio sites.[201] University housing 
is broadly divided into three sections: North Campus, West Campus, and 
Collegetown. Since a 1997 residential initiative, West Campus houses transfer 
and returning students, whereas North Campus is almost entirely populated 
by freshmen.[202] The only options for living on North Campus for upperclassmen 
are the program houses and co-op houses: Risley Residential College, Just 
About Music, the Ecology House, Holland International Living Center, the 
Multicultural Living Learning Unit, the Latino Living Center, Akwe:kon, 
and Ujamaa, as well as the co-op houses Wait Terrace, Wait Ave, Whitby, 
Triphammer, and others. In an attempt to create a sense of community and 
an atmosphere of education outside the classroom and continue Andrew Dickson 
White's vision, a $250 million reconstruction of West Campus created residential 
colleges there for undergraduates.[203] The idea of building a house system 
can be attributed in part to the success of Risley Residential College, 
the oldest continually operating residential college at Cornell.[204] Additionally, 
Cornell has several housing areas for graduate and professional students. 
Of these, Schuyler House (which was formerly a part of Sage Infirmary)[205] 
has a dorm layout, while Maplewood Apartments, Hasbrouck Apartments, and 
Thurston Court Apartments are apartment-style, some even allowing for family 
living. Off campus, many single-family houses in the East Hill neighborhoods 
adjacent to the university have been converted to apartments. Private developers 
have also built several multi-story apartment complexes in the Collegetown 
neighborhood. Nine percent of undergraduate students reside in fraternity 
and sorority houses, although first semester freshmen are not permitted 
to join them.[206] Cornell's Greek system has 67 chapters and over 54 Greek 
residences that house approximately 1,500 students. About 42% of Greek 
members live in their houses.[207] Housing cooperatives or other independent 
living units exist, including Watermargin, Telluride House, Triphammer 
Cooperative, the Center for Jewish Living, the Wait Cooperative, Von Cramm 
cooperative, and Cayuga Lodge.[208] Besides this there exists also cooperative 
housing not owned by Cornell, like Gamma Alpha or Stewart Little. As of 
2014[update], Cornell's dining system was ranked 3rd in the nation by the 
Princeton Review.[209] The university has 30 on-campus dining locations, 
and a program called the Cross Country Gourmet Guest Restaurant Series 
periodically brings chefs, menus, and atmosphere from restaurants to Cornell's 
ten cafeterias.[210] Cornell has 36 varsity intercollegiate teams that 
have the nickname of the Big Red. An NCAA Division I institution, Cornell 
is a member of the Ivy League and ECAC Hockey and competes in the Eastern 
College Athletic Conference (ECAC), the largest athletic conference in 
North America.[211] (ECAC Hockey is no longer affiliated with the ECAC.) 
Cornell's varsity athletic teams consistently challenge for NCAA Division 
I titles in a number of sports, including men's wrestling, men's lacrosse, 
men's ice hockey, and rowing (the women's crew program is subject to the 
NCAA, while the men's rowing program is governed by its own administrative 
body, the Intercollegiate Rowing Association). Under the Ivy League athletic 
agreement, the university does not offer athletic scholarships for athletic 
recruiting.[212] Cornell University's football team had at least a share 
of the national championship four times before 1940[213][214] and has won 
the Ivy League championship three times, last in 1990.[215] Cornell University 
runs one of the largest collegiate outdoor education programs in the country, 
serving over 20,000 people every year. The program runs over 130 different 
courses including but not limited to: Backpacking and Camping, Mountain 
Biking, Bike Touring, Caving, Hiking, Rock and Ice Climbing, Wilderness 
First Aid, and tree climbing.[216] COE also runs one of the largest pre-freshman 
summer programs known as Outdoor Odyssey.[217] Most classes are often entirely 
taught by paid student instructors and courses count toward Cornell's physical 
education graduation requirement.[218] One of the most remarkable facilities 
at Cornell Outdoor Education is The Lindseth Climbing Wall. The wall is 
the largest indoor natural rock climbing wall in North America, covering 
the entire east end of Bartels Hall, and is 160' wide and 30' high, for 
a total of 4,800 square feet of climbing surface.[219] Over the past year, 
COE has been extensively fundraising to fully upgrade and modernize the 
wall.[220] Cornelliana is a term for Cornell's traditions, legends, and 
lore. Cornellian traditions include Slope Day, a celebration held on the 
last day of classes of the spring semester, and Dragon Day, which includes 
the burning of a dragon built by architecture students. Dragon Day is one 
of the school's oldest traditions and has been celebrated annually since 
1901, typically on or near St. Patrick's Day. The dragon is built secretly 
by the architecture students, and taunting messages are left for the engineering 
students for the week before Dragon Day. On Dragon Day, the dragon is paraded 
across the Arts Quad and then set afire.[221] According to legend, if a 
virgin crosses the Arts Quad at midnight, the statues of Ezra Cornell and 
Andrew Dickson White will walk off their pedestals, meet in the center 
of the Quad, and shake hands, congratulating themselves on the chastity 
of students. There is also another myth that if a couple crosses the suspension 
bridge on North Campus, and the young woman does not accept a kiss from 
her partner, the bridge will fall. If the kiss is accepted, the couple 
is assured a long future together.[222] The university is also host to 
various student pranks. For example, on at least two different occasions 
the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7 m) 
tall McGraw clock tower—once a 60-pound (27 kg) pumpkin and another time 
a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how 
the items were put in place remains a mystery.[223] The colors of the lights 
on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's 
Day.[224] The clock tower also plays music. The school colors are carnelian 
(a shade of red) and white, a play on "Cornellian" and Andrew Dickson White. 
A bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the 
introduction of the mascot "Touchdown" in 1915, a live bear who was brought 
onto the field during football games.[6] The university's alma mater is 
"Far Above Cayuga's Waters", and its fight song is "Give My Regards to 
Davy". People associated with the university are called "Cornellians". 
Cornell offers a variety of professional and peer counseling services to 
students.[225] Gannett Clinic offers on-campus outpatient health services 
with emergency services and residential treatment provided by Cayuga Medical 
Center.[226] For most of its history, Cornell provided residential medical 
care for sick students, including at the historic Sage Infirmary.[227] 
Cornell offers specialized reproductive health and family planning services.[228] 
The university also has a student-run Emergency Medical Service (EMS) agency. 
The squad provides emergency response to medical emergencies on Cornell 
University campus and surrounding university-owned properties. Cornell 
EMS also provides stand-by service for university events and provides CPR, 
First Aid and other training seminars to the Cornell community.[229] The 
university received worldwide attention for a series of six student suicides 
by jumping into a gorge that occurred during the 2009–10 school year, and 
they have since added temporary fences to the bridges which span its gorges 
while more permanent measures are in process. There were cases of gorge-jumping 
in the 1970s and 1990s.[230] Before this abnormal cluster of suicides, 
the suicide rate at Cornell had been similar to or below the suicide rates 
of other American universities, including a period between 2005 and 2008 
in which no suicides occurred.[231][232] Cornell University Police protect 
the campus and are classified as peace officers and have the same authority 
as the Ithaca city police. They are similar to the campus police at Ithaca 
College and Syracuse University because those campus police are classified 
as armed peace officers. The Cornell University Police are on campus and 
on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Their duties include, but are 
not limited to: patrolling the university around the clock, responding 
to emergency situations as well as non-emergency calls for service, crime 
prevention services, active investigation of crimes on campus, enforcement 
of state criminal and motor vehicle laws, and campus regulations.[233][non-primary 
source needed] Cornell counts numerous notable individuals who have either 
come to the university as faculty to teach and to conduct research, or 
as students who have gone on to do noteworthy things. In total, 54 Nobel 
laureates were either faculty or students at Cornell.[10] As of 2009[update], 
Cornell had 1,639 full-and part-time faculty members affiliated with its 
main campus,[9] 1,235 affiliated with its New York City divisions, and 
34 affiliated with its campus in Qatar.[9] Cornell's faculty for the 2005–06 
academic year included three Nobel laureates, a Crafoord Prize winner, 
two Turing Award winners, a Fields Medal winner, two Legion of Honor recipients, 
a World Food Prize winner, an Andrei Sakharov Prize winner, three National 
Medal of Science winners, two Wolf Prize winners, five MacArthur award 
winners, four Pulitzer Prize winners, a Carter G. Woodson Scholars Medallion 
recipient, 20 National Science Foundation career grant holders, a recipient 
of the National Academy of Sciences Award, a recipient of the American 
Mathematical Society's Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement, a recipient 
of the Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics, and three Packard Foundation 
grant holders.[9] Kurt Lewin taught at Cornell from 1933 to 1935 and is 
considered the "father of social psychology".[234] Norman Borlaug taught 
at the university from 1982 to 1988 and is considered the "father of the 
Green Revolution",[235] being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and 49 honorary doctorates.[236] 
Frances Perkins joined the Cornell faculty in 1952 after serving as the 
first female member of the United States Cabinet and served until her death 
in 1965. Perkins was a witness to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire 
in her adolescence and went on to champion the National Labor Relations 
Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the Social Security Act while United 
States Secretary of Labor. Buckminster Fuller was a visiting professor 
at Cornell for one year (1952),[237] and Henry Louis Gates, African American 
Studies scholar and subject of an arrest controversy and White House "Beer 
Summit", taught at Cornell from 1985 to 1989.[238] Plant genetics pioneer 
Ray Wu invented the first method for sequencing DNA, considered a major 
breakthrough in genetics as it has enabled researchers to more closely 
understand how genes work.[239][240] Emmy Award-winning actor John Cleese, 
known for his roles in Monty Python, James Bond, Harry Potter and Shrek, 
has taught at Cornell since 1999.[241] Charles Evans Hughes taught in the 
law school from 1893 to 1895 before becoming Governor of New York, United 
States Secretary of State, and Chief Justice of the United States.[242] 
Georgios Papanikolaou, who taught at Cornell's medical school from 1913 
to 1961, invented the Pap smear test for cervical cancer.[243] Robert C. 
Baker ('43), widely credited for inventing the chicken nugget, taught at 
Cornell from 1957 to 1989. Carl Sagan was a professor at the university 
from 1968 to 1996.[244] He narrated and co-wrote the PBS series Cosmos, 
the Emmy Award- and Peabody Award-winning show that became the most watched 
series in public-television history. He also wrote the novel Contact, the 
basis for a 1997 film of the same name, and he won a Pulitzer Prize for 
his novel The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence. 
M. H. Abrams is a professor emeritus of English and was the founding editor 
of The Norton Anthology of English Literature.[245] James L. Hoard, a scientist 
who worked on the Manhattan Project Cornell has twice (2008 and 2009) been 
named a "Great College to Work For" by The Chronicle of Higher Education, 
due to receiving high ratings in compensation and benefits, connection 
to institution and pride, faculty-administration relations, job satisfaction, 
and post-retirement benefits.[246] Many faculty, as well as the president, 
live in the upscale suburb of Cayuga Heights, directly north of campus. 
Cornell counted 245,027 living alumni as of August 2008.[9] Its alumni 
constitute 31 Marshall Scholars and 28  Rhodes Scholars,[9][11] and Cornell 
is the only university with three female winners (Pearl S. Buck, Barbara 
McClintock, and Toni Morrison) of unshared Nobel Prizes among its graduates.[10][247] 
Many alumni maintain university ties through Homecoming's reunion weekend, 
through Cornell Magazine,[248] and through the Cornell Club of New York. 
In 2015, Cornell ranked #5 nationwide for gifts and bequests from alumni.[97] 
Cornell alumni are noted for their accomplishments in public, professional, 
and corporate life.[9][249] Lee Teng-hui was the president of Taiwan,[250] 
Tsai Ing-wen was elected to be the first female president of Taiwan,[251]

('47) developed the Heimlich maneuver,[282] Wilson Greatbatch ('50) invented 
the pacemaker,[283] James Maas ('66; also a faculty member) coined the 
term "power nap",[284] and C. Everett Koop ('41) served as Surgeon General 
of the United States.[285] A number of Cornellians have been prominent 
innovators. Thomas Midgley, Jr. ('11) invented Freon,[286] Jon Rubinstein 
('78) is credited with the development of the iPod,[287] and Robert Tappan 
Morris developed the first computer worm on the Internet. Eight Cornellians 
have served as NASA astronauts, Steve Squyres ('81) is the principal investigator 
on the Mars Exploration Rover Mission.[288] In aerospace, also, Otto Glasser 
('40) directed the USAF program that developed the SM-65 Atlas, the World's 
first operational Intercontinental ballistic missile. Bill Nye ('77) is 
well known as "The Science Guy".[289] In literature, Toni Morrison ('50; 
Nobel laureate) is well known for her novel Beloved, Pearl S. Buck ('25; 
Nobel laureate) authored The Good Earth,[290] Thomas Pynchon ('59) penned 
such canonical works of postwar American fiction as Gravity's Rainbow and 
The Crying of Lot 49, and E. B. White ('21) authored Charlotte's Web and 
Stuart Little.[291] Media personalities who have graduated from Cornell 
include conservative Ann Coulter ('84)[292] and liberals Bill Maher ('78) 
and Keith Olbermann ('79).[293] Several Cornellians have also achieved 
critical acclaim in entertainment. Dan Duryea ('28) became a well-known 
Hollywood Actor in the 1940s-1960s,[294] Christopher Reeve ('74) played 
Superman,[260] Frank Morgan was The Wizard of Oz, Jimmy Smits ('82) was 
in Star Wars: Attack of the Clones,[260] and Ronald D. Moore created the 
2004 remake of Battlestar Galactica. On the architectural front, alumnus 
Richmond Shreve (1902) designed the Empire State Building,[295] and Raymond 
M. Kennedy ('15) designed Hollywood's famous Grauman's Chinese Theatre.[296] 
In athletics, Cornell graduates include football legend Glenn "Pop" Warner 
(1894),[297] former head coach of the United States men's national soccer 
team Bruce Arena ('73),[298] National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman 
('74),[299] six-time Stanley Cup winning hockey goalie Ken Dryden ('69),[300]
