The 2008 Chicago White Sox season was the organization's 109th season in 
Chicago and 108th in the American League. The White Sox won the American 
League Central division title for the first time since 2005. They finished 
the regular season tied with the Minnesota Twins (88–74) and won a one-game 
playoff for the division title. They subsequently lost the 2008 American 
League Division Series to Tampa Bay Rays. Individual highlights for the 
White Sox included the breakout season of offseason acquisition Carlos 
Quentin and the strong rookie season of infielder Alexei Ramírez. Gavin 
Floyd nearly threw a no-hitter against the Minnesota Twins on May 6, broken 
up by Joe Mauer's double in the ninth inning. The White Sox set a new home 
record at U.S. Cellular Field of 54–28 (.658 pct.) breaking the 2003 home 
record of 51–30 (.629 pct.). Finishing fourth in the American League Central 
division coupled with having both MLB's lowest batting average and on-base 
percentage in 2007 prompted the White Sox to make numerous transactions, 
particularly with West Coast teams, to improve their lineup. Other players 
no longer with the team from the 2007 season are Alex Cintrón, Darin Erstad 
(signed with Houston), Andy González, Mike Myers, Heath Phillips, Scott 
Podsednik, and Luis Terrero. Two coaching staff changes were made, with 
the hiring of Pittsburgh Pirates third base coach Jeff Cox and bullpen 
coach Juan Nieves. Cox replaces Razor Shines, while Nieves replaces Art 
Kusnyer. 14–13 16–13 Had AJ Pierzynski got no hitter he would have 5 no
