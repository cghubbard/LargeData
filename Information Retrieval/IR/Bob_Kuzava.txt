Robert Leroy Kuzava (born May 28, 1923) is an American former professional 
baseball player, a left-handed pitcher for the Cleveland Indians (1946–47), 
Chicago White Sox (1949–50), Washington Senators (1950–51), New York Yankees 
(1951–54), Baltimore Orioles (1954–55), Philadelphia Phillies (1955), Pittsburgh 
Pirates (1957) and St. Louis Cardinals (1957). He was born in Wyandotte, 
Michigan. In 2003, Bob Kuzava was inducted into the National Polish-American 
Sports Hall of Fame.[1] Kuzava helped the Yankees win three consecutive 
World Series from 1951–53. He gained saves in the final games of both the 
1951 World Series against the New York Giants (Game 6) and 1952 against 
the Brooklyn Dodgers (Game 7). He pitched in the ninth inning of a 1953 
World Series Game 5 victory for the Yankees as well. Although his success 
in the World Series came in relief, Kuzava was a starting pitcher for the 
Yankees for three seasons, throwing 12 complete games. He joined them on 
June 15, 1951, with the Washington Senators trading him to New York for 
three players, and proceeded to earn three championship rings as a Yankee. 
Kuzava, whose nickname was "Sarge", finished fourth in voting for the 1949 
American League Rookie of the Year for having a 10–6 record for the Chicago 
White Sox, with nine complete games. He had been a military policeman during 
World War II.[2] Born and raised in the Detroit area, Kuzava made his Major 
League debut against the Detroit Tigers. He was the Indians' starting pitcher 
for a late-season 1946 game in Cleveland, and over eight innings he gave 
up just four hits and one earned run. He got no decision, the game lasting 
11 innings, with Detroit's Dizzy Trout pitching all 11 for the victory. 
He spent most of the 1947 and 1948 seasons in the minor leagues before 
his breakout season with the White Sox in 1949. In a 10-season career, 
Bob Kuzava had a 49–44 Win–Loss record, 213 Games (99 Started), 34 Complete 
Games, 7 Shutouts, 58 Games Finished, 13 Saves, 862 Innings Pitched, 849 
Hits Allowed, 427 Runs Allowed, 388 Earned Runs Allowed, 54 Home Runs Allowed, 
415 Walks, 446 Strikeouts, 8 Hit Batsmen, 18 Wild Pitches, 3,748 Batters
