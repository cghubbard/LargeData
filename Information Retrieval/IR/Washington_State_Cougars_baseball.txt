The Washington State Cougars baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate 
baseball team of Washington State University, located in Pullman, Washington. 
The Cougars' home venue is Bailey–Brayton Field, first opened 36 years 
ago for the 1980 season and located on the university's campus. Head coach 
Marty Lees took over the program ahead of the 2016 season. The program 
has been a baseball member of the Pac-12 Conference in NCAA Division I 
since the start of the 1960 season, following the dissolution of the Pacific 
Coast Conference. Through 2014, the Cougars have appeared in four College 
World Series and 16 NCAA Tournaments. In conference postseason play, WSU 
has won one Northwest Conference Tournament, one Pacific Coast Conference 
Northern Division Tournament, one Pacific-8 Conference North Division Tournament, 
and four Pacific-10 Conference Northern Division Tournaments. In regular 
season play, the program has won five Northwest Conference Championships, 
12 Pacific Coast Conference Northern Division titles, four AAWU Championships, 
nine Pac-8 North Division titles, and 11 Pac-10 North Division titles. 
As of the start of the 2013 Major League Baseball season, 32 former Cougars 
have appeared in Major League Baseball. The first season of organized baseball 
at the school was 124 years ago in 1892, shortly after the school's founding. 
In that season, the team had an 11–1 record; its first game was a 26–0 
victory over Pullman Military College on March 12. After a three-year hiatus 
from 1893–1895, the team returned for one season in 1896. After another 
break in 1897, baseball at Washington State returned permanently in 1898. 
Previously led by team captains, H.E. Lougheed was named its first head 
coach for the 1901 season. Through the end of the 1909 season, the program 
competed as an independent and compiled a 110–59–1 (.650) record.[2] Washington 
State joined the Northwest Conference in 1910; prior to the 1912–1913 academic 
year, former head football coach John R. Bender returned to Pullman from 
Saint Louis University. He also served as the school's head baseball coach 
beginning with the 1913 season, in which the team won its first Northwest 
Conference title and finished at 7–1. The team won the conference title 
in 1914 and 1915, along with the conference tournament in 1915.[2] After 
the 1915 season, Bender left to coach football at Kansas State and was 
replaced by Fred Bohler, who led the team to Northwest Conference titles 
in 1916 and 1918. Following the 1918 season, the program joined the Pacific 
Coast Conference (PCC), which had been formed in December 1915. In its 
first season in the PCC, the team finished fourth in 1919.[2] In 1919, 
the college adopted the Cougar as its athletic programs' official nickname.[3] 
In the summer of 1926, 30-year-old Buck Bailey came to Pullman as an assistant 
football coach and head baseball coach.[4][5] Born and raised in central 
Texas, Bailey played baseball and football at Texas A&M and served in the 
U.S. Army during the First World War.[4][6] In his first season as head 
coach in 1927, the Cougar nine finished first in the PCC North Division 
and won the PCC Tournament. The team also won the North Division title 
in 1933, 1936, and 1938.[2] In 1932, Art McLarney debuted for the New York 
Giants on August 23 and became the program's first alumnus to play in the 
major leagues.[7] In February 1943, Bailey joined the U.S. Navy during 
World War II. The Eugene Register-Guard article that announced Bailey's 
departure referred to him as an "athletic comedian," and other sources 
attest that Bailey had a colorful coaching style.[8][9][10] For three seasons, 
1943–1945, basketball coach Jack Friel coached the program.[2][11] Bailey 
returned prior to the start of 1946 season and resumed his coaching duties. 
From 1947–1950, the program won four consecutive PCC North Division titles. 
This run culminated in the program's first College World Series appearance 
in 1950, the first College World Series played at Rosenblatt Stadium in 
Omaha, Nebraska. To qualify, the Cougars defeated Stanford to win the PCC 
Tournament. At the World Series, WSC opened with three consecutive wins 
over Tufts, Alabama, and Rutgers,[12] but lost 12–1 to defending champion 
Texas, who had lost their opener in the double-elimination tournament.[13] 
The last two teams remaining and both with one loss, the Cougars and Longhorns 
met again three days later in the national championship game,[14] which 
Texas won 3–0.[2][15][16] Future major leaguers Ted Tappe and Gene Conley 
played on the 1950 team.[17] The program reached the College World Series 
again under Bailey in 1956. To qualify from District VIII, the team defeated 
USC in the PCC Tournament. At the CWS in Omaha, the Cougars were eliminated 
without a win after consecutive defeats to Bradley and New Hampshire,[2][16] 
and tied for seventh place with NYU.[18] After the 1959 baseball season, 
the PCC dissolved on July 1 following a scandal involving illegal payments 
to football players at several of its schools.[19] In reaction, five former 
PCC members, formed the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU), 
which Washington State's baseball program joined when play began in the 
1960 season.[20] Later renamed the Pac-8, it became the Pac-10 in 1978 
and the Pac-12 in 2011.[21][22] The program qualified for the NCAA Tournament 
in each of its first two seasons in the AAWU. In both 1960 and 1961, the 
Cougars were eliminated by USC in Los Angeles in the District VIII Regional.[16] 
Three years after his retirement, Bailey and his wife Frances were killed 
in an automobile collision in New Mexico in October 1964.[5][23] Following 
Buck Bailey's retirement at the end of the 1961 season, the school hired 
Bobo Brayton, a former Washington State player and head baseball coach 
at Yakima Valley Junior College for a decade.[24][25][26] In Brayton's 
first three seasons, WSU failed to qualify for the postseason, but won 
the AAWU North Division in 1965 and qualified for the NCAA Tournament. 
In the second round of the District VIII Regional, the Cougars defeated 
Stanford and advanced to the College World Series in Omaha. WSU finished 
third, with wins over Texas and Connecticut, and two losses to Ohio State.[2][16][27] 
The second loss to Ohio State was 1–0 in 15 innings, a complete game by 
Buckeye starter Steve Arlin, who recorded twenty strikeouts and gave up 
just three hits.[28] In 1966, WSU again qualified for the NCAA Tournament 
but was eliminated by USC in the District VIII Regional finals.[16] Following 
the season, future major leaguer Danny Frisella was selected by the New 
York Mets in the 1966 Major League Baseball Draft.[29] Following the 1968 
season, two future major leaguers, Rick Austin and Ron Cey, signed professional 
contracts.[30] After missing the playoffs for three consecutive seasons 
from 1967–1969, the Cougars won the Pac-8 North Division title and qualified 
for the Pac-8 Tournament in 1970. This division title started a streak 
of 11 consecutive North Division titles (1970–1981) and 19 of the 22 from 
1970–1991. In that stretch, the program qualified for eight NCAA Tournaments 
(1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1990). In 1976, the Cougars 
hosted and won the West Regional, defeating Pepperdine and Cal State Fullerton 
twice, in order to advance to the College World Series. In its first game, 
the team defeated Oklahoma, but then was eliminated by consecutive losses 
to Arizona State and Maine.[2][16][31][32][33][34][35][36][37] Following 
the 1979 season, renovations of Martin Stadium, Washington State's football 
venue, led to the construction of a new running track. It was to be located 
on the site of today's Bailey–Brayton Field, but excavation difficulties 
led to an exchange of sites. The Mooberry Track was built on the old Bailey 
Field and a new baseball venue was built, retaining the name Bailey Field.[38][39][40] 
In 1984, stadium lighting was installed at the venue, and the first nighttime 
college baseball game in the Pacific Northwest was played between Washington 
State and Washington on May 11, 1984.[41][42] In 1989, the field hosted 
Washington State's first nationally televised games, played on April 30 
and May 1 against California and shown on ESPN.[43] In the late 1980s and 
early 1990s, two Cougars were named first team All-Americans. Both John 
Olerud, selected in 1988, and Aaron Sele, selected in 1990, had lengthy 
careers in Major League Baseball. In addition to being named an All-American 
in 1988, Olerud was named the National Player of the Year.[2] Brayton retired 
after the 1994 season, finishing his career at WSU with 1,162 wins in 33 
seasons. His Cougar teams reached ten NCAA Tournaments and two College 
World Series.[2][44][45] Steve Farrington, the head coach at Lower Columbia 
College in Longview for over a decade, was hired to replace Brayton in 
late June 1994.[46][47] Originally from Newport, Oregon, he was a three-sport 
athlete at Eastern Washington in Cheney in the early 1970s; four years 
each of football and baseball and a year of basketball.[47][48] Farrington's 
first season, 1995, was the third season of NCAA sanctions that had been 
imposed on the program for rules violations.[49] The Cougars were 18–12 
(.600) in conference and won the Pac-10 North, but were swept in the Pac-10 
finals in Los Angeles by South champion USC, 9–6 and 4–0.[50] Their overall 
record of 28–30 (.407) in 1995 was the first losing record at WSU since 
1957, and the Cougars did not receive an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament.[2][51] 
Pac-10 champion USC advanced to the College World Series and finished as 
runner-up. From 1996–1998, Farrington's teams finished third in the Pac-10 
North three times, missing the playoffs in each season. In both 1999 and 
2000, after the Pac-10 abolished its divisions, Washington State finished 
last in the Pac-10,[2] with conference records of 4–20 and 6–18, and his 
contract was not renewed following the 2000 season.[52][53][54] Farrington's 
overall record with the Cougars in six seasons was 136–198 (.407), with 
a regular season conference record of 59–73 (.447).[53] He later coached 
baseball at Columbia Basin College in Pasco, while also teaching science 
at Richland High School.[55][56] Prior to the 2000 season in January, Bailey 
Field was renamed Bailey–Brayton Field,[57] adding Bobo Brayton's name 
to the Cougars' home venue.[38][58] In August 2000, Albertson College (College 
of Idaho) head coach Tim Mooney was hired to replace Farrington.[59][60] 
Raised in Weiser, Idaho,[61] he played at neighboring Idaho in the late 
1970s, the final years of the Vandal baseball program. Mooney had great 
success as a head coach at Albertson in Caldwell, including an NAIA national 
title in 1998.[62][63][64] Under Mooney, the Cougars had losing conference 
records in each of his four seasons and finished no higher than a tie for 
eighth in the Pac-10. The only year with a winning overall record was his 
last in 2004, at 29–26 (.527), and 9–15 (.375) in conference.[65][66] These 
struggles, combined with cases of Mooney physically and verbally abusing 
players, led to his resignation following the 2004 season.[2][67][68][69] 
Mooney's overall record at WSU was 84–135 (.384) and 28–68 (.292) in conference. 
He was later a fundraiser for athletics for his alma mater, the University 
of Idaho.[61][70] Donnie Marbut, who had served as an assistant under Mooney 
for one season in 2004, was promoted to head coach in late May.[69][71] 
In his first several seasons at the helm, the program continued to struggle, 
finishing no higher than a sixth-place tie in the Pac-10.[2] Marbut was 
also officially reprimanded by the university in 2006, when a Seattle Times 
report revealed that he had falsified parts of his résumé when applying 
for a coaching position at Washington State.[72][73][74] In 2009 and 2010, 
however, the Cougars finished near the top of the Pac-10 and appeared in 
the NCAA Tournament in both seasons.[2] In the 2009 tournament, the team 
appeared in the Norman Regional as a #3 seed. After losing the opening 
game to Arkansas, the Cougars defeated Wichita State 3–2 in an elimination 
game. In the next game, however, they were eliminated by Oklahoma. In the 
2010 tournament, the team earned a #2 seed in the Fayetteville Regional. 
This time, the team made it to within one win of the Super Regional round, 
but lost to Arkansas 7–2 in the elimination game.[16] After an 11 seasons 
run, a 314–304 record with two post season appearances, Bill Moos announced 
Donnie Marbut would not be returning for the 2016 season.[75] Following 
the Cougars' runner-up finish at the College World Series in 1950, the 
program's home venue was renamed Bailey Field.[76][77] The Cougars played 
at the field through the end of the 1979 season; it was located on the 
current site of Mooberry Track, with home plate at its northwest corner.[38][78] 
Following the 1979 baseball season, the university announced plans to renovate 
Martin Stadium, the school's football venue. As part of those renovations, 
a new track & field venue was planned to the east, at the site of the present 
baseball stadium. Difficulties in excavation led to the switch of track 
and baseball sites, and a new baseball stadium was built;[39][40] it maintained 
the name Bailey Field when it opened at the start of the 1980 season.[38][79][80] 
The field was renovated in 1981, 1984, and 1988. It was renamed Bailey–Brayton 
Field in early 2000,[57] for Chuck Brayton, the program's head coach from 
1962 to 1994. The facility has a capacity of 3,500 spectators and features 
a FieldTurf surface, electronic scoreboard, and stadium lighting.[38][58] 
The program's longest-tenured and most successful head coach is Chuck Brayton, 
who was head coach for 33 seasons (1962–1994) and led the Cougars to 1,162 
wins.[81] The following is a list of the program's yearly records since 
1892, its first season of varsity competition.[2][22][82][83][84]       National 
champion         Postseason invitational champion         Conference regular 
season champion         Conference regular season and conference tournament 
champion       Division regular season champion       Division regular 
season and conference tournament champion       Conference tournament champion 
The following is a list of notable former Cougars and the seasons in which 
they played for the program.[2][17][85] Five Cougars were selected in the 
2012 Major League Baseball Draft: 1B Taylor Ard by the Seattle Mariners 
(7th round), OF Derek Jones by the Colorado Rockies (8th round), 2B Tommy 
Richards by the Baltimore Orioles (24th round), OF Kyle Johnson by the 
Los Angeles Angels (25th round), and 3B Patrick Claussen (34th round).[86] 
All five players elected to sign professional contracts.[87][88][89][90][91]
