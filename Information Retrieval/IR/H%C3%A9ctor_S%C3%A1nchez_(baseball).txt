Héctor Enrique Sánchez (born November 17, 1989) is a Venezuelan professional 
baseball catcher for the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played for the San Francisco Giants and Chicago White Sox. 
In 2011, after hitting .302 with 11 home runs and 58 RBI in 52 games for 
the San Jose Giants, Sánchez was promoted to the Fresno Grizzlies.[1] Sánchez 
was called up to the majors for the first time on July 15, 2011.[2] He 
was selected to join the Giants' 2012 Opening Day roster as the backup 
catcher behind Buster Posey.[3] Due to their pairing during Barry Zito's 
rehab stint at AAA in 2011, and their continued success together at the 
major-league level in 2012, he had been designated as Zito's personal catcher.[4] 
On April 23, 2012, Sánchez hit his first career home run off of Dillon 
Gee.[5] On May 6, 2012, Sánchez hit a pitch-hit, walk-off single against 
the Milwaukee Brewers despite a five-man infield.[6] On May 21, Sánchez 
hit his second career homer in the top of the 14th inning, against the 
Brewers again, to help the Giants win 4–3.[7] In 2012, Sánchez appeared 
in 74 games, batting .280 with 3 home runs and 34 RBI. He was the backup 
catcher during the 2012 postseason, which culminated in the Giants winning 
the 2012 World Series.[8] In 2013, Sánchez played in 63 games, batting 
.248 with 3 home runs and 19 RBI. On August 15, 2013, he hit a pinch-hit, 
3-run home run off Washington Nationals closer Rafael Soriano with two 
outs in the top of the ninth inning. The Giants were trailing 3–1 and held 
on to win 4–3.[9] On April 23, 2014, Sánchez hit his first career grand 
slam in the top of the 11th inning against the Colorado Rockies.[10] On 
June 25, 2014, Sánchez was the catcher for Tim Lincecum's second no-hitter 
against the San Diego Padres.[11] Sánchez went on the concussion list on 
July 26 and suffered a second concussion while on a rehab assignment and 
missed the rest of the 2014 season.[12] On July 21, 2015, Sánchez hit his 
second career grand slam off Dale Thayer of the San Diego Padres.[13] In 
early September, Sánchez strained his left hamstring and sprained his left 
ankle running to first base and missed the rest of the season.[14] After 
the season, Sánchez was not tendered a contract by the Giants and became 
a free agent.[15] On December 14, 2015, Sánchez signed a minor league deal 
with an invitation to spring training with the Chicago White Sox.[16] The 
White Sox promoted Sánchez to the major leagues on April 26, 2016.[17] 
He was designated for assignment on May 9.[18] After being designated by 
the White Sox, Sanchez was claimed by the San Diego Padres and added to 
the 25-man roster.[19] On June 14, he was designated for assignment and
