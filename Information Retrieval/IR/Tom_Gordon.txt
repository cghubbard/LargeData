Thomas Flynn Gordon (born November 18, 1967), nicknamed "Flash", is a former 
Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher. He pitched for the Kansas City 
Royals (1988–95), Boston Red Sox (1996–99), Chicago Cubs (2001–02), Houston 
Astros (2002), Chicago White Sox (2003), New York Yankees (2004–05), Philadelphia 
Phillies (2006–08) and the Arizona Diamondbacks (2009). In 1998 he won 
the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award and led the American League in 
saves and in games finished, and in 1998-99 he set a then-MLB record with 
54 consecutive saves. Gordon attended Avon Park High School in Avon Park, 
Florida, and was a letterman in baseball. Gordon began his career as a 
starting pitcher with the Kansas City Royals, first appearing in five games 
at the age of 20 late in the 1988 season. He became an immediate sensation 
in Kansas City the following year, posting a 17-9 record and a 3.64 ERA 
in his first full season, and he finished second in the 1989 Rookie of 
the Year balloting. Gordon also recorded 153 strikeouts in 1989, the tenth 
highest total in the American League, all of which earned him the nickname 
"Flash." Gordon continued to post top-10 strikeout totals during the 1990 
and 1991 seasons, but his number of wins dropped each year while his ERA 
crept upwards. Finally, in 1992 Gordon had one of the worst season of his 
career, posting a 6-10 record and a 4.59 ERA. He bounced back with seasons 
of 11 or 12 wins from 1993 to 1995, but he never quite regained his rookie 
form. Prior to the 1996 season, Gordon left Kansas City and signed as a 
free agent with the Boston Red Sox. In his first season in Boston, Gordon 
had a 12-9 record and a 5.59 ERA – the highest ERA of his career to that 
point. Over the next two years, however, the Red Sox converted Gordon from 
a starting pitcher to a closer and his career reignited. In 1998, Gordon 
set the club's single-season record for saves (46), with 43 of them in 
a row, and was named to his first All-Star Team. His success continued 
in 1999 setting a major league record with his 54th consecutive save in 
June, but a nagging elbow injury limited him to just 21 appearances, which 
required ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction (or UCL) also known as 
Tommy John surgery, that forced him to spend 2000 on the disabled list. 
His popularity in Boston at this point led New England-based writer and 
Red Sox fan Stephen King to reference him as the object of infatuation 
for the young protagonist of the 1999 novel The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. 
After subsequent stops in Houston and both sides of Chicago, Gordon landed 
in New York. He was an invaluable addition to the Yankees bullpen, serving 
as a set-up for closer Mariano Rivera, or as a middle reliever in tough 
situations. At this point, Gordon had compiled a career 122-111 record 
with 1733 strikeouts, a 3.99 ERA, 114 saves, and 1896.2 innings in 671 
games (203 as a starter). He signed a three-year deal worth $18 million 
with the Phillies before the 2006 season. Gordon debuted in Philadelphia 
as a closer during the 2006 season, replacing Billy Wagner, who signed 
with the Mets after the 2005 season. On May 2, 2007, Gordon was placed 
on the disabled list due to a rotator cuff inflammation, at which time 
he was replaced in the closer slot by former starting pitcher Brett Myers.[1] 
Following both pitchers' return from the DL, Myers retained the closer 
position, while Gordon was shifted to a late-inning reliever. Flash was 
named to the 2006 NL All Star Team as the leading vote getter from the 
players. Gordon had fully rehabilitated his arm and was prepared for the 
'08 season. However, on July 6, 2008, Gordon was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list for tenderness in his right elbow. Fellow reliever Brad Lidge praised 
Gordon calling him "a stud" and said that the Phils were hoping for him 
to return to the team after his 15-day stint. Prior to being placed on 
the disabled list, Gordon recorded a 13.45 earned run average giving up 
six runs in four total innings since June 11. He eventually was ruled out 
for the season but was able to earn his only World Series ring on the bench 
in the 2008 World Series. On February 6, 2009, Gordon signed a one-year 
deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[2] After spending most of the season 
on the disabled list, he was released on August 11. On August 9, Gordon 
said that he still thinks he has what it takes to compete, but that he's 
"fine" with retirement.[3] Gordon is the father of Miami Marlins second 
baseman Dee Gordon. Another son, Nick Gordon, was drafted fifth overall 
by the Minnesota Twins in the 2014 Major League Baseball draft and currently 
plays for their Class A affiliate Cedar Rapids Kernels.[4] Gordon is mentioned 
by name in the title, and frequently referred to in the Stephen King novel
