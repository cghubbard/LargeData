Dinesh Kumar Patel (born May 8, 1989 in Lucknow, India) is an Indian right-handed 
baseball pitcher who played in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. Along 
with Rinku Singh, he was the first Indian national ever to sign a contract 
with a major American sports club. Neither Patel nor Singh had ever thrown 
a baseball before beating over 37,000 competitors in The Million Dollar 
Arm, an Indian reality television show designed to find new baseball talent.[1] 
Due to extreme poverty and inability to meet the expenses of raising a 
child, Patel's parents had left him to be reared by his maternal grandmother 
in Khanpur.[2] At the age of 14, he started visiting Sampurnanand Stadium 
in Sigra where he met athletes and trained himself to play field hockey. 
In 2004, he was selected for a regional sports hostel in Lucknow.[2] Patel 
won a gold medal in fieldhockey at the National School Games at Pune in 
2006.[3] Patel, along with Singh, tried out in front of scouts from 20 
Major League Baseball teams in November 2008.[4] Reports from Pittsburgh 
Pirates scouts Joe Ferrone and Sean Campbell led to general manager Neal 
Huntington signing both to contracts with the organization. With the deal, 
the pair became the first Indians to sign American major league baseball 
contracts.[5][6] The total signing bonus for the two was $8,000.[7] After 
training, the two returned to visit their families in India before entering 
Pirates training camp in Bradenton, Florida.[4] Patel, along with Singh, 
played for the Pirates' Gulf Coast League team.[8] He had a successful, 
yet brief, 2009 season for the Pirates, picking up a victory on August 
13 (exactly one month after his countryman Singh got his first, and only, 
win of the year) and finishing with a 1–0 record and 1.42 ERA, allowing 
two runs (one earned) on six hits in 6 1⁄3 innings.[9] Patel's 2010 season 
was less successful, with an 8.59 ERA in 7 1⁄3 innings, over nine games; 
he was released in December 2010 and returned home to finish school.[10] 
Patel began to teach baseball in Delhi and in 2011, he helped his village 
boys prepare for the second season of the Million Dollar Arm talent hunt 
for about two months. He did not charge any money. After his return, Patel 
was also "seriously" practicing the javelin. Patel participated at the 
national athletics championship in Kolkata in 2011 and the Federation Cup 
athletics championship in April 2012.[3] In 2012, Patel said, "My family's 
economical and emotional conditions have improved. I could renovate home 
in the village and my sister's wedding was arranged with the money that 
I sent home. My family gathered self esteem and respect in society. It 
is always good to see your near and dear ones happy."[2] Patel and Singh's 
story is the basis for the Walt Disney Pictures sports film, Million Dollar
