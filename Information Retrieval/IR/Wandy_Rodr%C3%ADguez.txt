Wandy Fulton Rodríguez (born January 18, 1979) is a Dominican former professional 
baseball pitcher. He played for the Houston Astros from 2005 to 2012, the 
Pittsburgh Pirates from 2012 to 2014 and the Texas Rangers in 2015. Rodríguez 
is a native of Santiago Rodríguez, in the North Region (Cibao Region) of 
the Dominican Republic. Rodríguez signed with the Houston Astros organization 
in January 1999.[1] In 2001, he pitched for the Martinsville Astros. In 
2002, he pitched for the Lexington Legends. In 2003, he pitched for the 
Salem Avalanche. In 2004, he pitched for the Round Rock Express. He made 
his major league debut May 23, 2005. Rodríguez, who concluded with a 10–10 
record in his 2005 rookie season, ended the season with a rocky September, 
going 1–4. Overall, he had a 5.53 ERA and struck out 80 batters throughout 
the season. The Astros succeeded in getting to the 2005 World Series in 
which they were swept in four games by the Chicago White Sox. Rodríguez 
performed decently in the game 1 of the series, relieving Roger Clemens 
in the third inning with the score tied at 3. Rodriguez surrendered one 
more run in the bottom of the fourth inning, earning the loss as the White 
Sox went on to win, 5–3.[2] Rodriguez posted a 2.45 ERA for the Series. 
In 2006, after struggling to a 5.22 ERA, Rodríguez was optioned to the 
minors on July 21. Brandon Backe was activated from the 60-day disabled 
list to take his place on the major-league roster and the Astros rotation. 
However, Rodríguez was recalled on August 19 after Backe had to have Tommy 
John surgery. Rodriguez finished the season with a 9–10 record and a 5.64 
ERA, along with 98 strikeouts in 135 innings.[3] On July 6, 2007, Rodríguez 
earned his first complete-game shutout in a 4-hit performance against the 
New York Mets. Rodriguez had his first full healthy season in the majors, 
as he started and played in 31 games, finishing with a 4.58 ERA and a 9–13 
record, along with 158 strikeouts in 182 innings. His BAA was a major improvement, 
going from .290 of the previous year to .254.[4] In 2008, Rodríguez struggled 
with injuries again, starting only 25 games and pitching only 137 innings. 
However, his performance was a big improvement statistically, finishing 
with a 3.54 ERA and a 9–7 record, along with 131 strikeouts and a perfect 
fielding percentage.[5] Rodríguez had a career year in 2009, after being 
moved up into the second spot in the Astros' rotation behind ace Roy Oswalt. 
He started in 33 games and pitched 205 innings while finishing with a 3.02 
ERA, which ranked 9th in the NL. He struck out 193, ranking 8th and had 
his second complete game and shutout of his career.[6] Rodríguez regressed 
from his 2009 campaign in the first half of 2010, going 6–11 with a 4.97 
ERA with only 77 strikeouts in 101 1⁄3 innings pitched prior to the All-Star 
break. He turned it around in the second half however, going 5–1 with a 
2.11 ERA with 101 strikeouts in 93 2⁄3 innings, to finish with an 11–12 
record with a 3.60 ERA and 178 strikeouts.[7][8] To begin the 2012 season, 
Rodríguez was the last Astro (player or coach) remaining from the 2005 
squad that went to the World Series.[9] (Although 1 player, Chad Qualls, 
has since re-joined the Astros). On January 26, 2011, he and the Astros 
agreed to a new three-year contract for $34 million.[10] He finished the 
2011 season with an 11–11 record and a 3.49 ERA over 191 innings. On July 
24, 2012, the Pittsburgh Pirates traded Rudy Owens, Robbie Grossman and 
Colton Cain to the Houston Astros for Rodríguez and cash.[11] Rodriguez's 
Pirates debut came in Houston, on July 28, 2012, against his former team, 
the Astros, where he recorded a no-decision. This meant that no one on 
the 2005 Astros team that made it to the World Series was left on the Astros 
team. On May 22, 2014, the Pirates designated Rodriguez for assignment. 
On May 30, 2014, Rodríguez was released by the Pirates.[12][13] On December 
27, 2014, he agreed to a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies.[14] 
However, he failed his physical examination performed by Phillies' doctors, 
and subsequently signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves.[15][16] 
He was released on April 3.[17] On April 6, 2015 Rodríguez signed a minor 
league contract with the Texas Rangers.[18] On May 10, in a game against 
the Tampa Bay Rays, Rodriguez retired 15 straight batters to start the 
game. Adding on to his previous outing of 19 straight outs in his May 5 
start in Houston, he set the Rangers franchise record for most consecutive 
batters retired with 34 straight.[19] After a string of bad starts, Rodriguez 
was designated for assignment on July 29,[20] and became a free agent on 
August 6.[21] On August 16, 2015, Rodriguez signed a minor league contract 
with the Kansas City Royals.[22] On January 26, 2016, Rodriguez signed 
a minor league deal to return to the Astros.[23] He was released on April 
11, 2016. On April 29, 2016, Rodriguez signed a minor league deal with 
the Baltimore Orioles.[24] On June 9th, 2016, Rodriguez opted out of his 
minor league deal from the Orioles, becoming a free agent. When he was 
scouted by the Astros in 1998, Rodriguez falsely stated his name was Eny 
Cabreja and that he was only 17 years old. He had convinced a friend to 
let him borrow his identity. The real Cabreja was born on August 18, 1981, 
while Wandy was born on January 18, 1979. Wandy lived under the name Eny 
Cabreja until 2002, when he admitted to the Astros that he was in fact 
Wandy Fulton Rodriguez and that he was not really 21 years of age but 23.[25][26]
