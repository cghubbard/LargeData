Guy Terrell Bush (August 23, 1901 – July 2, 1985) was an American right-handed 
pitcher in Major League Baseball, nicknamed the Mississippi Mudcat.[1] 
Bush played in the major leagues from 1923 to 1938 and again in 1945. The 
6-foot-tall (1.8 m) pitcher played for the Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates, 
Boston Bees, St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds in his seventeen-year 
professional baseball career. Bush was originally drafted and signed by 
the Chicago Cubs in 1919 for $1,000.[2] After attending the now defunct 
Tupelo Military Institute in Mississippi,[3] Bush made his major league 
debut for the team that year on September 17, 1923.[4] In his only game 
of the season, Bush came in the ninth inning and gave up one hit while 
striking out two. He returned with the Cubs the following season as a dual-duty 
starter and reliever. Bush pitched to a 2–5 record in sixteen games, half 
of which he started. He threw four complete games and finished four others. 
In 80-2/3 innings of work, he gave up 91 hits and 36 earned runs, and struck 
out 36 batters. In the following few seasons, Bush started to take a larger 
role as a reliever. Bush led the league in saves in 1925, with four, and 
again in 1929 when he had eight.[4] He also led the league in relief wins 
that season and the following season.[1] After finishing the 1926 campaign 
fourth in the league with a 2.86 earned run average in a primarily relief 
setting,[4] Bush started more games than he relieved the following season.[5] 
Despite giving up 79 walks while only striking out 62 batters, he had a 
10–10 record on the year, with a 3.03 ERA. Bush started 22 of his 36 games, 
including a marathon on May 14, 1927, in which Bush and Boston Braves starter 
Charlie Robertson duelled for eighteen innings.[1] Bush won the game after 
Robertson tired, surrendering five runs in the 18th inning. In the National 
League since then, only Carl Hubbell in 1933 and Vern Law in 1955 have 
matched Bush's marathon performance.[1] Bush's ERA to 3.83 the next year, 
but he did post a 15–6 record in 42 games, 24 of which he started. Bush 
followed up with a career year in 1929. He finished the year on top of 
the league in saves and games pitched, and fourth in the league for wins.[4] 
Also that year, Bush ranked twelfth in the NL Most Valuable Player Award 
voting.[4] Even more impressive, Bush had a streak of eleven straight wins 
until it was broken by a relief loss on August 12 against the Braves.[1] 
Bush was a large contributor to the team's pennant-winning season, in which 
they finished on top of the NL with a 98–54 record.[6] Bush was most dominant 
in the 1929 World Series against the Philadelphia Athletics. Bush pitched 
two games in the series, starting one and relieving another. Bush started 
Game 3 and pitched a complete game, surrendering only one run on nine hits.[7] 
Despite the Cubs' loss of the Series in five games, Bush pitched a total 
of eleven innings with 4 strikeouts and gave up just one run.[7] After 
the success of the 1929 season, Bush had a disappointing season in 1930. 
In 225 innings of work, Bush posted a 15–10 record with a 6.20 ERA, one 
of the worst in the league that season. He gave up 291 hits, fifth highest 
in the league, and led the league in earned runs allowed with 155 and wild 
pitches with 12. In November 1930, writer F.C. Lane wrote in Baseball Magazine 
about Bush's unique pitching windup: On the hurling mound (Guy) Bush has 
developed a curious 'hop-toad' lunge that is unique. When he really bears 
down on the ball, he actually springs forward and finishes up in a squat 
position like a catcher reaching for a low pitch. This freakish hop forward 
would be impossible to many pitchers. Bush can do it by virtue of his lithe 
and wiry build, his long thin legs.[3] Bush had an improved season in 1931, 
thanks to performances such as a September 13 one-hitter against the Braves. 
He finished the year with a 16–8 record and a 4.49 ERA, in 180.1 innings 
of work. The following year, the Cubs again won the pennant behind Bush's 
19–11 record and 3.20 ERA. That year, Bush finished the year third in the 
league for wins and 23rd in the NL MVP voting. The Cubs were pinned up 
against the New York Yankees in the 1932 World Series. It was an infamous 
matchup, known now for the general tension and fighting between both teams. 
Bush did not fare well this time around in the World Series. As the starting 
pitcher for the Cubs in Game 1, Bush gave up eight runs on three hits, 
and walked five in just five innings of work, en route to a 12–6 Yankees 
win.[8] Bush started Game 4, and lasted less than an inning. He hit Babe 
Ruth and gave up two hits and one earned run and was plucked from the pitching 
mound.[9] For the series, Bush finished with a 0–1 record and 14.29 ERA, 
and gave up nine earned runs in less than six innings of work. Bush bounced 
back the next year, finishing the year with his first 20-game winning season. 
Bush had another career year, finishing second in the league in wins and 
ninth in the league with a 2.75 ERA. Bush followed up with another solid 
season in 1934, his last with the Cubs. On November 22, 1934, just a little 
over a month after the season, Bush was traded along with outfielder Babe 
Herman and Jim Weaver to the Pittsburgh Pirates for left-handed pitcher 
Larry French and future Hall of Famer Freddie Lindstrom, also then playing 
outfield after spending most of his career at third base.[1] Bush left 
the Cubs after twelve years with the team and finished as one of the club's 
winningest pitchers with a record of 152–101. Bush did not show much improvement 
in 1935 with the Pirates. He did, however, place his name into the record 
books. On May 25, the Pirates played the Braves in one of Babe Ruth's final 
games. Ruth put on a performance, collecting four hits including three 
home runs and knocking in six runners. The first home run shot came off 
pitcher Red Lucas, while the last two came off Bush. The last home run 
was Ruth's career home run #714, and was a mammoth of a shot. It was the 
first home run to clear the right field grandstands at Forbes Field and 
was reportedly measured as a 600-foot (180 m) bomb.[1] Despite Ruth's goliath 
performance, Waite Hoyt, who came in relief for Bush, won the game after 
he held on to an 11–7 Pirates win. The Pirates sent the 34-year-old Bush 
to the bullpen for the 1936 season. The transition did not go well with 
Bush as he gave up 49 hits in just 34.7 innings of work, and posted a 5.97 
ERA. Midway through the season, on July 20, 1936, the Pirates released 
Bush. He was subsequently signed by the Boston Bees (the former Braves).[4] 
The Bees used him primarily as a starter and his stats improved, as a result. 
Despite pitching with below a 3.60 ERA in both 1936 and 1937, the St. Louis 
Cardinals bought Bush from the Bees months prior to the start of the 1938 
season. On May 7, after coming in relief in six games, Bush was released 
by the Cardinals. Bush's career seemed to be over, however, he did come 
back to the majors seven years later, at age 43.[1] Since many teams were 
affected by players leaving to fight in World War II, ex-players like Bush, 
Babe Herman and Hod Lisenbee were signed as replacements.[1] The Reds signed 
Bush prior to the 1945 season, and used him as a closer. Despite picking 
up one save in four relief appearances, the Reds released Bush on June 
2, 1945. Bush's career was finished, this time for good. The Mississippi 
Mudcat finished his career with a 176–136 pitching record and a 3.86 ERA 
over 2722 innings and 542 games–308 as a starter, 234 in relief.[1][5] 
Bush also managed the Battle Creek Belles of the All-American Girls Professional 
Baseball League in parts of two seasons spanning 1951–1952.[10] Guy Bush 
died at age 83 on July 2, 1985 of cardiac arrest after working in his garden
