Jewel Winklemeyer Ens (August 24, 1889 – January 17, 1950) was an American 
infielder, manager and coach in Major League Baseball. Born in St. Louis, 
Missouri, Ens served the Pittsburgh Pirates as a utility infielder (1922–25), 
player-coach (1923–25), coach (1926–29; 1935–39) and manager (1929–31). 
He was a member of the 1925 World Series champion Pirates and their 1927 
National League championship edition. He managed the Pirates from August 
28, 1929, through the end of the 1931 season, leading them to a 176–167 
record (.513) with two fifth-place finishes in the eight-team NL during 
his two full seasons as skipper. Ens also coached in the Majors for the 
Detroit Tigers (1932), Cincinnati Reds (1933; 1941) and Boston Braves (1934), 
and spent eight full seasons (1942–49) as manager of the Syracuse Chiefs, 
then the Reds' top farm system affiliate. During his 17-year active career 
(1908; 1910–25), Ens threw and batted right-handed, stood 5 feet, 10 1⁄2 
inches (1.8 m) tall and weighed 165 pounds (75 kg). After a long career 
in minor league baseball as a shortstop and third baseman, he made his 
National League debut with the Pirates at age 32 in 1922, appearing in 
a career-high 47 games played. For the next three seasons, he played a 
total of only 12 games, as he served as an aide to Hall of Fame manager 
Bill McKechnie. In 59 total big-league games and 186 at bats, Ens registered 
54 hits, with eight doubles, four triples and one home run, hit off Wilbur 
Cooper of the Chicago Cubs on April 15, 1925, and sparking Pittsburgh to 
an 8–4 win.[1] He drove in two of his career 24 runs batted in that day. 
Ens succeeded Donie Bush as manager of the Pirates late in the 1929 season. 
Pittsburgh was in second place, but 14 1⁄2 games behind the front-running 
Cubs, when the change happened. Under Ens, the Pirates won four out of 
five from the Cubs in a head-to-head series at Forbes Field, trimming three 
games off Chicago's lead, but they ultimately finished the season as runners-up, 
10 1⁄2 games out, going 21–14 under Ens. During his two full seasons, 1930 
and 1931, the Pirates posted 80–74 and 75–79 records, and Ens was replaced 
by George "Moon" Gibson for the 1932 campaign. In subsequent National League 
coaching assignments, he again assisted McKechnie in Boston and Cincinnati. 
After his coaching days, Ens enjoyed a successful, eight-year run as manager 
of the Syracuse Chiefs, making the International League playoffs five times 
and winning three (1942–43; 1947) Governors' Cup championships. He was 
still the incumbent manager and general manager of the Chiefs when he died 
at age 60 in Syracuse, from pneumonia, in January 1950. He was elected
