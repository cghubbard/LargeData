Montford Montgomery Cross (August 31, 1869 – June 21, 1934), was an American 
Major League Baseball baseball player. He played fifteen seasons in the 
majors, between 1892 and 1907, for five different teams. Cross played most 
of his career in Philadelphia, where he was the starting shortstop for 
the Philadelphia Phillies from 1898 until 1901. At that point, he jumped 
to the new American League and the crosstown Philadelphia Athletics. He 
was their starting shortstop from 1902 until 1904, including the 1902 team 
that won the AL pennant in the year before the World Series began play. 
After batting just .189 in 1904, Cross relinquished the starting role to 
19-year-old rookie John Knight for much of 1905, when the Athletics won 
their second pennant. After batting .266 in his part-time role, Cross regained 
the starting role in 1906 when Knight was moved to third base to replace 
Lave Cross, who had been sold to the Washington Senators. However, he batted 
just .200, and would be replaced as the starter once again in 1907, this 
time by Simon Nicholls. His major league career ended that season but Monte 
Cross remained in the industry, playing in three minor leagues from 1908 
to 1911 (playing records). At least in 1915 he played semiprofessionally, 
for the Media, Pennsylvania team in the Delaware County League at age 46.[1] 
Cross coached the Maine Black Bears baseball team from 1916–1921, the longest 
tenure of any coach to that point in the program's history. In his six 
seasons, Maine had a record of 33-33-3. An April 1916 article in the Lewiston 
Daily Sun said of Cross, "His easy-going, but nevertheless strict instructions 
and discipline, together with the knowledge of the inside features of the 
National game, and the manner in which he teaches them, make an everlasting 
impression on the students, players, and managers."[2][3] Below is a table
