Welland (2011 population 50,631)[1] is a city in the Regional Municipality 
of Niagara in Southern Ontario, Canada. The city is in the centre of Niagara. 
Within a half-hour, residents can travel to Niagara Falls, Niagara-On-The-Lake, 
St. Catharines, Port Colborne and Buffalo. It has been traditionally known 
as the place where rails and water meet, referring to the railways from 
Buffalo to Toronto and Southwestern Ontario, and the waterways of Welland 
Canal and Welland River, which played a great role in the city's development. 
The city is separated by the Welland River and Welland Canal which links 
Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Welland is the home of C Company of The Lincoln 
and Welland Regiment which is part of 32 Canadian Brigade Group, the classification 
of this unit is Light Infantry. Welland's nickname is The Rose City. The 
city was settled in 1788 by the United Empire Loyalists. On 19 October 
1814, Canadian forces led by George Hay, 8th Marquess of Tweeddale,[3] 
met an American raiding party, numbering approximately nine hundred, near 
the eastern edge of the present community during the Battle of Cook's Mills. 
After an intense skirmish, the Americans retreated to Buffalo, New York. 
Cook's Mills was the second to last engagement of the War of 1812 on Canadian 
soil.[4] The Welland Canal has been involved in the area's history since 
the First Welland Canal was extended to reach Lake Erie in 1833. A wooden 
aqueduct was built to carry the Welland Canal over the Welland River at 
what is now downtown Welland, and the area became known as simply Aqueduct. 
A lock to cross from the canal to the river and vice versa was also built. 
A small shantytown soon developed around the facility, providing essential 
services in what was a convenient stop-over location. The growing town 
was later named Merrittsville, after William Hamilton Merritt, the initiator 
of the Welland Canal project. This name is still reflected in the name 
of the Merrittville Highway (Niagara Road 50), which served as the primary 
north-south route in central Niagara before the construction of Highway 
406. Welland gained its present name when it was incorporated on July 25, 
1858. It became a city in 1917. In addition to the presence of the canal, 
one of the few railway crossings across the canal was near Welland. The 
two factors contributed to the development of heavy industry in Welland. 
The Plymouth Cordage Company was the first major industrial company to 
open a plant in Welland in 1906. By the 1930s, Welland was an important 
industry location in the region and was developing rapidly. In the 1960s, 
the city was starting to outgrow the canal passing through its core. The 
Welland By-Pass project, started in 1967 and finished in 1973, provided 
a new, shorter alignment for the Welland Canal by removing it from downtown 
Welland to the city's outskirts. With the completion of the bypass, Welland's 
east end (and the former town of Crowland) became a virtual man-made island 
between the new and old canal channels. Originally, this was viewed with 
enthusiasm as the canal's constant traffic was interfering heavily with 
transportation within the city. The canal's old alignment was renamed the 
Welland Recreational Waterway with the purpose of developing several recreational 
facilities and tourist attractions along its shores. The original plans 
called for fishing platforms, water slides, boat rental points, as well 
as marine and rail historical exhibits.[citation needed] The effects of 
the canal relocation were compounded by the gradual, but steady move of 
industry out of Welland as a trend for global manufacturing was developing. 
As a result, there was much deterioration in downtown Welland in the years 
immediately after the project. Many businesses relocated to the city's 
north end, where a retail hub was being developed in and around the Seaway 
Mall. The City of Welland is working to revitalize the downtown core through 
an ongoing community improvement plan. Integral to the program is the use 
of incentives to promote revitalization and redevelopment. However, a report 
published by the City of Welland in 2013 stated "for over 10 years now, 
these programs have produced only very moderate uptake and development 
since being introduced."[5]:78 Welland's mayor is Frank Campion. The Welland 
city council is made up of the mayor and 12 councillors, each elected in 
his or her ward. There are six wards in Welland, each of which elects two 
councillors. The mayor and two regional councillors, George Marshall and 
Peter Kormos (who died in late March 2013). Another representative of Welland 
has filled Peter's seat since late May 2013, to represent the city on Niagara 
Regional Council. The city is responsible for fire protection, libraries, 
parks and recreation and secondary streets, but many municipal services 
come from the broader level of government, the Niagara Region. Regional 
responsibilities include social welfare, community health, and policing 
through the Niagara Regional Police. The chief local political issue is 
the redevelopment of the downtown core, which has deteriorated in the years 
after the Welland By-Pass project. The Civic Square project has been completed 
after spanning the terms of three city councils and three mayors. The new 
building, facing both East Main Street and the old canal, houses the city 
hall and the Welland Public Library. The project is proving to be a catalyst 
for development, as several new establishments have been opened downtown 
and some businesses are expanding. Welland is represented in the House 
of Commons of Canada by the Liberal Party Member of Parliament Vance Badawey, 
and in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario by the NDP Member of Provincial 
Parliament Cindy Forster, representing the federal and the provincial ridings 
of Welland. During the 2011 Census,[6] the population of Welland was determined 
to be 50,631, making Welland the 96th largest city in Canada. The population 
rose from 50,331 in the 2006 Census. According to the 2001 census, 95.5% 
of the population is Caucasian, 1.7% Aboriginal, 1.1% Black, 0.2% Korean, 
and 0.3% of other Asian descent. 17.7% of inhabitants are under the age 
of 14, while those over 65 account for 16.9%. Another significant cultural 
group was established with the opening of the Plymouth Cordage plant. Many 
workers relocated to Welland from the company's operations in Plymouth, 
Massachusetts were of Italian origin. To minimise the potential effects 
of cultural and language barriers, Plymouth Cordage sent four foremen to 
Welland: one was Italian, one French, one German and one English. The neighbourhood 
that the company built for its employees (now Plymouth Cordage Heritage 
District [1]) became the first Italian ethnic neighbourhood in Welland. 
The Top 5 largest ethnic groups include: English: 24.9%, French: 23.3%, 
Scottish: 14.4%, Italian: 13.3%, and Irish: 13.1%. There are also many 
people of eastern European origin from countries like Croatia, Hungary, 
and Poland, as well as a growing Hispanic community.[7] In 1914, a local 
business called Empire Cotton Mills was bought by a Quebec-based company. 
They brought in twenty francophone families to work in the mill, giving 
a start to a French-speaking community still very alive in the city today. 
Welland is one of only three communities in southern Ontario (excluding 
eastern Ontario) where Franco-Ontarians, as a percentage of the community's 
population, exceed the provincial average of 4.8%. (The other two are Penetanguishene 
and Lakeshore.) Many schools, churches, banks, business and other institutions 
operate or offer services in French. Like the rest of Ontario, Welland 
has access to four public education systems: the regional school boards 
are the Niagara Catholic District School Board and the District School 
Board of Niagara. The Conseil scolaire de district du Centre-Sud-Ouest 
(the French public board) and the Conseil scolaire de district catholique 
Centre-Sud (the French Catholic board) also operate schools in Welland. 
There are twenty elementary schools and five secondary schools in Welland. 
Of these, four elementary schools and two secondary schools are part of 
French-language boards. All schools offer education in French to some extent. 
The Niagara Catholic District School Board operates six elementary schools 
within the city including Alexander Kuska KSG, Holy Name, St. Andrew, St. 
Augustine, St. Kevin and St. Mary, each offering Kindergarten through to 
Grade 8. The board also operates one secondary school in the city: Notre 
Dame, which offers Grade 9 through to Grade 12. Continuing education courses 
are also offered by the board at its Father Patrick H. Fogarty Learning 
Centre within the city. The District School Board of Niagara operates ten 
elementary schools within the city and two secondary schools: Welland Centennial 
servicing the western side of the city and Eastdale Secondary servicing 
the eastern side. Thanks to the large population of francophones, both 
the Conseil scolaire de district du Centre-Sud-Ouest (the French public 
board) and the Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud (the 
French Catholic board) operate elementary and secondary schools in Welland. 
École secondaire Confédération and École secondaire catholique Jean-Vanier 
are the only French public and French Catholic, respectively, secondary 
schools in the Niagara Region. Jean-Vanier relocated to a new building 
in the north end of the city in 2010, adjacent to a proposed municipal 
sports park. Due to the abundance of French schools, it is not unusual 
for parents to opt for French-language education for their children, even 
if only one or neither of the parents have French heritage. The process 
further strengthens the bilingual character of Welland. A campus of Niagara 
College of Applied Arts and Technology is located in Welland. The college 
offers post-secondary diplomas, baccalaureate degrees and advanced level 
programs. Welland, because of its proximity to the Sir Adam Beck hydroelectric 
station at Niagara Falls, was historically known for its steel, automotive, 
and textile industries.[8] Initially, manufacturing firms were the biggest 
employers in Welland. The plants of companies like Union Carbide, United 
Steel, Plymouth Cordage Company, three drop forges, a cotton mill, and 
the Atlas Steel Co., as well as general manufacturing plants, had big influence 
on shaping early Welland. While recent years saw the end of Welland operations 
for several companies, such as John Deere which announced in September 
2008 that it would be closing its plant and relocating manufacturing to 
Wisconsin and Mexico, businesses such as Lakeside Steel (a pipe plant formerly 
owned by Stelco, since 2012 owned [9] by JMC Steel) continues to employ 
residents. The Atlas Steel Co. was founded at some time in the 1920s. Roy 
H. Davis and partners bought the Welland plant from its American shareholders 
in 1928. Gun barrels were produced here during the second World War. It 
was for a time Canada's largest manufacturer of stainless steel. The plant 
housed a vacuum smelter line, necessary for the production of Titanium. 
The onset of the CanAm FTA, NAFTA, GATT and globalization brought decline, 
and subsequently the ownership changed hands numerous times: the Sammi 
group acquired it in 1989, followed by Slater Steels of Mississauga in 
2000, who went bankrupt in 2003. The plant was finally torn down in 2007. 
The Canadian branch plant of the Plymouth Cordage Company was started in 
1904 due to Parliament's initiation of a 25% import duty on rope and related 
products. Plymouth, with roots in Massachusetts, moved to secure its business 
in binding twine, necessary to package farm crops such as grass, wheat 
or straw. The city of Welland grew up around the Plymouth plant, which 
was prior to 1904, farmland (owned by Morwood, McCoppen, Leitch and Gunn). 
The cordage industry was a victim of the harvester-thresher, which obviated 
the need for binding (or baling) twine, as the threshing operation is now 
performed in a contiguous step immediately when the stalk is cut. Due to 
a large concentration of francophones in the city and resulting large degree 
of bilingualism, the city has been successful in bringing several call 
centres to Welland. Correspondingly, Canadian Tire Financial Services is 
Welland's largest employer, employing over 1,600 people in two centres. 
Welland's electricity comes from the Sir Adam Beck hydroelectric generation 
plants at Niagara Falls via Welland Hydro. Thanks to the presence of the 
massive plant, power remained on in over half of Welland during the 2003 
North America blackout until rolling blackouts began the next day in an 
effort to provide power to areas that hadn't had it for nearly 24 hours. 
Welland is located in the centre of south Niagara. Over the years, urban 
growth has all but united the northwest part of Welland with the community 
of Fonthill. Prior to the Welland By-Pass project, the Welland Canal cut 
through the centre of Welland. As a result, a very prominent split was 
created between the east side and the west side of the city. The west side 
grew primarily to the north, while the east side expanded south. The west 
side also became the more affluent of the two. Today, even though the canal 
traffic no longer causes regular interruption in the traffic across the 
city, the channel lives on as Welland Recreational Waterway. The waterway 
still serves as a very prominent visual feature dividing the city, and 
it is perhaps for this reason that the east side/west side division is 
still very much alive in the minds of Wellanders. East side and west side 
are very commonly used as basic directions. The communities of Cooks Mills 
and Dain City have their own separation stories. Cooks Mills, located on 
the other side of the By-Pass channel than the rest of Welland, has arguably 
been protected against the impact of urban sprawl, but the necessity of 
using one of the two highway tunnels to cross the canal causes some residents 
to head to nearby Niagara Falls instead. Dain City, located in the south 
of the city where the two channels meet, is separated by the massive approaches 
to the Townline Tunnel required to provide the low grade for the rail lines 
that use the tunnel. Dain City was built for, and by, the Dain Manufacturing 
Company (Now known as John Deere), the main employer in the area, as a 
"company town". John Deere announced in September 2008 that it would be 
closing its plant and relocating manufacturing to Wisconsin and Mexico. 
There is a slight movement to develop the northern end of the east side, 
an undeveloped area. A community named Hunters Pointe is being built close 
to the banks of the By-Pass, and the area received further investment when 
a new Wal-Mart store opened on Woodlawn Road close to Highway 406. Technically, 
both the east side and Dain City are peninsulas, surrounded by the waters 
of the old and new channels of the Welland Canal and connected to "solid" 
ground only by the relatively small plug in the old canal along the Townline 
Tunnel approaches. A man-made geographic feature is the Merritt Island, 
a strip of land approximately five kilometres long and, in some places, 
less than 100 metres wide. The island was created when the alignment of 
the First Welland Canal was constructed basically parallel to the Welland 
River and since the abandonment of the old canal has been established as 
Merritt Park, featuring a popular four kilometre-long paved trail. Welland 
experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) typical of the Great 
Lakes region, with cold, snowy winters, mild, wet springs, warm, humid 
summers, and cool, wet falls. The winter is the driest season, with no 
more than 77.8 mm (3.06 in.) of precipitation in its wettest month. Though, 
due to lake-effect snow, the city receives, on average, 97.8 cm (38.5 in.) 
of snow every winter. The average temperature in January, the coldest month, 
is −4.7 °C (23.5 °F). Spring is mild (13 °C (55.4 °F) on average) and rainy 
(240.3 mm (9.46 in.) of rain in April, May and June, also with 5.4 cm (2.12 
in.) of snow in April and May). Summer is warm, with an average high temperature 
of 24.5 °C (76.2 °F) and, humid, with 251 mm (9.88in.) of total rainfall. 
Autumn is cool (average temperature of 4.3 °C (39.7 °F)) and wet (actually, 
the wettest of Welland's seasons) (273.7 mm 10.8 in.) of total precipitation. 
The extreme high and low temperatures are 37.8 °C (100 °F), recorded on 
4 July 1911; 1 July 1931; 26 August 1948, and −32.8 °C (-27 °F), recorded 
on 25 January 1884. Daily precipitation extremes include a rainfall of 
118.4 mm (4.66 in.) on 30 September 1959, and a snowfall of 81.3 cm (32.0 inches) 
on 1 March 1900. One of the worst winter storms to affect the Welland area 
was in January 1977 when the Blizzard of '77 hit Niagara and Western New 
York from 28 January to 1 February 1977. Notable parks are Chippawa Park, 
an older, well-developed park in the northwest; Memorial Park, a newer 
park in the southeast; and Merrit Island Park along the canal. Chippawa 
Park has rolling hills, mature specimen trees, playgrounds, a large pond, 
and small ornamental fish pond in a formal rose garden. It features a large 
war memorial carved from Lacasse granite and designed by a famous Canadian 
sculptor, Elizabeth Wyn Wood. Memorial Park was a project of the 1967 Centennial. 
It is very flat with younger trees. It has an outdoor pool shaped like 
a figure 8. There is also a cenotaph at this park. In the late 1960s, the 
eastern part of the park was used for the Welland Canal bypass. Patrons 
of the park can often see ships passing through the bypass. At the heart 
of the old city of Welland, near the Main Street Bridge, the Welland River 
passes under the old Welland Canal, then runs parallel to it for a few 
miles. Between the old canal and the river lies a long narrow strip of 
land referred to as Merrit Island that is now a park. The end of the park 
closest to the centre of the city has picnic tables and playground equipment. 
The island also includes a main trail that follows the bank of the old 
canal for the entire length of the park, with a variety of intermittent 
side paths and trails. The Welland Canal Parkway Trail is a paved recreational 
path beginning in the City of St. Catharines at Lake Ontario and ending 
at Lake Erie in Port Colborne. The sections of the trail located within 
Welland are paved. The trail follows alongside the Welland ship and Recreational 
Canals, and passes through downtown Welland. The Welland Canal, linking 
Lake Ontario with Lake Erie, is the transportation mode that Welland is 
best known for. Until 1972, the canal passed through downtown Welland. 
As of the end of the 1972 shipping season, the canal was re-routed via 
the Welland Canal Bypass east of the city. Welland clings to its canal 
heritage, as evidenced by the steadfast preservation of the Main Street 
Lift Bridge (Welland Canal, bridge 13) shown in the photograph above. Highway 
406 is the main route out of Welland, leading north to Thorold, St. Catharines 
and onwards via Queen Elizabeth Way. However, the first six kilometres 
of the highway are not a freeway like the 400-series highways standard 
dictates, but rather a standard two-lane highway with at-grade interchanges. 
Funding to upgrade this section was approved in 2011 and work was underway 
in 2013 to upgrade to full 400 series standards from East Main Street to 
the Queen Elizabeth Way. Port Colborne is linked to Welland by Highways 
140 and 58. Port Colborne residents then can take the 406 further north. 
The Mid-Peninsula Highway, once constructed, can play an important role 
in the transportation patterns of Welland, as it might cross the Welland 
Canal along the Highway 58A corridor in the south of the city. Should that 
occur, Highway 406 will likely be extended to reach the new thoroughfare. 
Two of the three tunnels under the canal, Main Street Tunnel and Townline 
Tunnel, are located in Welland, just east of the main urbanised area. Welland 
boasts a rich railway history. The city motto is "Where Rails and Water 
Meet", referring to the two prevalent means of transportation. The Canada 
Southern Railway (CASO) passed through the south end of Welland, with a 
passenger station on King Street. The CASO operated very few trains of 
its own – the majority of traffic on the line consisted of New York Central 
Railway trains transiting between Windsor, Ontario (and the tunnel to Detroit), 
and one of two bridges over the Niagara River located at Niagara Falls 
and Fort Erie. Welland was also the terminus of the Toronto, Hamilton & 
Buffalo Railway's track (the link to Buffalo, New York being via the CASO 
line). The T, H & B ran joint passenger trains with the New York Central 
to provide through service between Toronto and Buffalo (via Hamilton, Ontario 
and Welland). There was also a Canadian National Railways (earlier, Grand 
Trunk Railway) line running in a North/South direction and crossing the 
CASO line at Welland Diamond. An interlocking tower (WX) stood here. Another 
line ran through the Dain City area of south Welland. This was the Canada 
Air Line Railway, and was also used by the Wabash Railway. Later, it became 
the Cayuga Subdivision of the Canadian National Railway. Lastly, the Niagara, 
St. Catharines and Toronto Railway provided electric interurban service 
from Port Colborne, Ontario to Thorold, Ontario via Welland. Passenger 
service ended in November 1959, but the tracks remained in freight use 
until 1981 when a trestle over the Welland River became unsafe and the 
line was removed from service. The relocation of the Welland Canal in the 
early 1970s caused massive changes in the local railway network. The new 
route of the canal was previously crossed by five separate railway lines. 
The new segment of canal would have no bridges, and just one railway tunnel, 
so all of these routes required redesign. The two branches of the CASO 
line, plus the Cayuga Subdivision were re-routed through the Townline Tunnel, 
while the North/South Canadian National line was split and discontinued 
as a through route. The station at King Street was abandoned and demolished. 
It was replaced by a new station outside of town, but passenger service 
ended soon after. Today, Welland is the location of one of only two remaining 
railway crossings that span the Welland Canal. The Townline Tunnel is built 
for three railway tracks, but the center track was removed in the early 
1990s. Now, only two tracks run through the tunnel. The north track is 
the Canadian Pacific Railway Hamilton subdivision. The south track was 
formerly the Canadian National Railway Cayuga subdivision. Since the abandonment 
of the majority of that subdivision, operations on this track were limited 
to occasional trains interchanging with Trillium Rail's Port Colborne Harbour 
Railway. Today, Canadian Pacific also uses this track as their "Brookfield 
Siding". There is also a Trillium Railway (Port Colborne Harbour Railway) 
north-south line running through the east side of Welland on the former 
Welland Canal railway/Canadian National tracks beside the former site of 
the Atlas Specialty Steels plant (torn down in 2007). A daily as requested 
(Monday to Friday) train operates along this route to Merritton. Trillium 
Railway has a handful of industries throughout Thorold and St. Catharines, 
on the former Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto trackage. No passenger 
trains stop in Welland – the closest Via Rail stations are in St. Catharines 
and Niagara Falls. Do take note that Via Rail ceased operations of their 
own trains to these stations on 25 October 2012. Amtrak does operate 2 
trains to these stations, under Via Rail control. Prior to the Welland 
Canal relocation in the early 1970s, there were two bridges crossing the 
old canal. The busiest was a swing bridge located between the Lincoln and 
Broadway bridges (the CASO line). This bridge was a relic of an earlier 
canal, and although it does not swing any longer, it remains in railway 
use. Once or twice per week, a local Trillium Rwy way freight crosses this 
bridge to access Vesuvius Industries on the west side of the old canal 
located on Trillium Rwy's West Welland Spur. The second crossing was as 
vertical lift bridge at Dain City, Ontario which also remains in use as 
the Trillium Rail Canal line. Prior to 1967, this section of The Canal 
line was referred to as CN's Cayuga Subdivision. The Cayuga Subdivision 
was then re-routed through the Townline Tunnel, which is to the north of 
Dain City. This section through Dain City was renamed the Canal Subdivision 
from this location at CN Welland Diamond, where it connects to the north-south 
trackage (former CN Welland Subdivision). This east-west trackage head 
continues to this day westward to a rail junction the by-pass of what is 
now operated as Trillium's Cayuga Spur, (Former location 3 miles away, 
west of Phillip's Road where the original ground of the CN Cayuga Subdivision 
continued onto St. Thomas, ON. Do note that CP Brookfield Siding becomes 
Trillium's Cayuga Spur where the Feeder Canal once cross through, prior 
to the building of this Townline Tunnel infrastructure, in the 1800s. This 
Cayuga Subdivision by-pass runs from between Wilhelm Road and Troup Road, 
east of Welland and to the west between Phillip's Road (mentioned above) 
Green Road S,(Formerly Farr Road S.). In total, the Cayuga Subdivision 
by-pass was a total length of 8.9 miles. A recent initiative proposed by 
local businessmen and politicians, in particular Trillium Railway owner 
Wayne Ettinger and former mayor Damian Goulbourne calls for the planned 
GO Train extension into the Niagara Region to include a station — and cross 
the Welland Canal — in Welland rather than St. Catharines. The proponents 
argue that an adequate rail line is already in place and using the Trillium's 
track through the Townline Tunnel would allow for uninterrupted train traffic 
to Niagara Falls. They also point out that a station in Welland would fit 
in the Niagara Region's "Grow South" policy of expanding the infrastructure 
south of the Niagara Escarpment.[10] The closest airport to Welland is 
the Welland/Niagara Central Airport on the western edge of the city. It 
is a small field airport and is not served by any regular links, but it 
is an international point of entry. However, the airport is under a number 
of developments in hopes to expand its services. For now, most air travellers 
use either Toronto's Lester B. Pearson International Airport or Hamilton's 
John C. Munro International Airport. The Buffalo Niagara International 
Airport is also used by some, as it is the closest, although it requires 
that travellers cross the American border. Between 1912 and 1930, local 
streetcar service was provided in Welland by the Niagara, Welland and Lake 
Erie railway which operated on East Main Street and King Street (then known 
as South Main Street). This company also provided a short-lived service 
on West Main Street and Niagara Street (then known as North Main) for about 
6 months in 1922.[11] Since 1973, Welland Transit operates the public transport 
service of scheduled bus services and paratransit covering the city. Also 
provided is Welland-St. Catharines Connection, a link to the St. Catharines 
public transit system from Niagara College to Brock University terminal 
in St. Catharines, with the first and last run of the day interconnecting 
to the downtown core. Service is also provided to Port Colborne and Pelham.[12] 
Niagara Food Festival, marketed as "the Peninsula's Tastiest Party", takes 
place in and around the city's downtown core in early fall and brings crowds 
from the entire region in addition to the locals. Niagara Regional Exhibition, 
running since 1853, is held at the Fairgrounds in the north end of the 
city every fall. Tradition stands that on at least one of the operational 
days it will rain. The Farmers' Market, held downtown in the Market Square, 
features up to 60 vendors offering food, Niagara wines, produce and homemade 
items every Saturday morning, year-round. Welland's Eastdale High School 
held its 50th Anniversary Reunion on 20, 21 and 22 May 2011. The Welland 
High and Vocational School Reunion was held 15/16 May 2009 in Welland. 
The school has since burned down. The Welland Dragon Boat Festival, takes 
place in June.[13] The Welland Rose Festival is one of Niagara's longest 
running festivals. The Rose Festival promotes and encourages community 
participation through many events such as the Rose Parade, Baby Show, Rose 
Show, Days in the Park, and more. Celebrating 50 years in 2011, the Rose 
Festival continues to offer a host of spectacular events and entertainers 
in the month of June. Welland's Seaway Mall gained national attention when 
a flash mob was filmed singing the Hallelujah Chorus in the food court 
in November 2010.[14] A video of the event went viral on YouTube,[15] gaining 
14.4 million views in less than a month. On 8 December, Canada AM broadcast 
a live performance from the same food court, drawing a crowd of about 500 
people.[16] Welland was the site of the first scene filmed for the movie 
Meatballs. Actor Bill Murray appears in front of the Kmart at Welland's
