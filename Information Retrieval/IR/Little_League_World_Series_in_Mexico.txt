Mexico joined in the Little League World Series as part of the Latin America 
Region from 1957 to 2000. Since 2001, when the LLWS expanded to sixteen 
teams, a team from Mexico has had an automatic berth in the World Series. 
The country currently has about 450 active leagues, making it the third-largest 
country in Little League participation.[1] Mexican teams have won three 
championships (1957, 1958 and 1997) and been runner-up three times (1964, 
1985 and 2008). In the 1985 World Series, the Mexicali Little League (Mexicali, 
Baja California. Mexico) represented the West Region of the United States. 
Because of its proximity to the El Centro/Calexico area in Southern California 
(the potential players from that region could have played for that city's 
leagues), Mexicali competed in and represented California's District 22 
in the Southern California division, won the West Region tournament, eventually 
became the United States champion, and was runner-up to the International 
champion (National Little League, Seoul, South Korea). After the 1985 Series, 
Mexicali was shifted from California leagues to Mexico leagues. Since 2001
