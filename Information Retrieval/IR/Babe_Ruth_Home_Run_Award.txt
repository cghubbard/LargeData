The Babe Ruth Home Run Award[note 1] was an annual award presented to the 
previous season's leading home run hitter in Major League Baseball (MLB).[3] 
The award was named after the legendary Babe Ruth, who led the American 
League in homers 12 times.[4] It was first awarded to Mark McGwire after 
his record-setting 1998 season. The award was a 21-pound (9.5 kg), 20-inch-high 
(51 cm) bronze statue of Ruth based on a 1920 photo of him following through 
on a tremendous swing.[5][6] The Babe Ruth Home Run Award was developed 
by brothers Jim and Brian Sullivan. Jim was the sculptor, while Brian focused 
on the marketing of the award. The Sullivans originally wanted to create 
a life-size statue of Ruth as a tourist attraction similar to the Michael 
Jordan statue. Unable to secure a sponsor, they created the award to honor 
Ruth.[4][5][6] The trophy was estimated to cost around $4,000 as of 2006, 
and it is funded by the Sullivans and given on behalf of their company, 
Sullivan Artworks based in Weymouth, Massachusetts.[4][7] MLB was not interested 
in sponsoring the award; the American League already honored its home run 
champion with a nameless award, and the National League offered the Mel 
Ott Award. Both the awards received little publicity.[8] The Babe Ruth 
Home Run Award was usually presented to the recipient by Ruth's daughter,
