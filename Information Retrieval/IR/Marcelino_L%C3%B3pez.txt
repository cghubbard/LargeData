Marcelino Pons López (September 23, 1943 – November 29, 2001) was a Major 
League Baseball pitcher. He was a member of the 1970 World Series Champion 
Baltimore Orioles. López signed as an amateur free agent with the Philadelphia 
Phillies at just sixteen years old. He made his major league debut in 1963,[1] 
but after just four appearances, was back in the minors by the end of April. 
After spending all of 1964 with Philadelphia's Triple-A affiliate, the 
Chattanooga Lookouts, he was the 'player to be named later" in the deal 
where the Phillies acquired Vic Power from the Los Angeles Angels for a 
player to be named later. In 1965, López went 14–13 with a 2.93 earned 
run average and 122 strikeouts for the newly renamed California Angels 
to finish second to Curt Blefary in American League rookie of the year 
balloting. His numbers fell off considerably in 1966, largely because he 
led AL starters in hit batsmen with nine, and was second in the league 
with twelve wild pitches (the Chicago White Sox's Joe Horlen had 14). Shoulder 
injuries limited López to just nine innings for the Angels in 1967. On 
June 15, he and minor leaguer Tom Arruda were sent to the Baltimore Orioles 
for Woodie Held. López spent all of 1968 in the minors before making his 
first major league appearance with the Orioles in 1969. At this point in 
his career, he was converted into a reliever, and was 4–2 with a 4.06 ERA 
out of the bullpen (he was 1–1 with a 5.40 ERA in his four starts). The 
Orioles ran away with the American League East by nineteen games over the 
Detroit Tigers. López's only appearance in the 1969 American League Championship 
Series came in game one. In the twelfth inning, he faced four batters, 
retiring only one before manager Earl Weaver removed him in favor of Dick 
Hall.[2] He did not make an appearance in the 1969 World Series against 
the New York Mets. López became one of the most reliable relievers in Baltimore's 
bullpen in 1970, as he had a 1.65 ERA in relief. He was 1–0 with a 3.18 
ERA as a starter. Baltimore returned to the post-season, and again, López 
made just one appearance. In the second game of the World Series, he faced 
just one batter, Bobby Tolan, and got him to fly out to Brooks Robinson 
in foul territory.[3] During spring training the following season, López 
was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for Roric Harrison and minor leaguer 
Marion Jackson. He began the 1971 season as a reliever, but was added to 
the starting rotation midway through the season. Though he had a respectable 
4.14 ERA, he was just 1–5 as a starter. López's contract was purchased 
by the Cleveland Indians during spring training 1972. After spending the 
entire season with Cleveland's Triple-A affiliate, the Portland Beavers, 
López made four appearances with the Indians that September. He played 
minor league ball for the San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates and Houston
