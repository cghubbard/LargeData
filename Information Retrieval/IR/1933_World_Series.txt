The 1933 World Series featured the New York Giants and the Washington Senators. 
The Giants won in five games for their first championship since 1922 and 
their fourth overall. The Giants easily defeated the Senators behind pitching 
aces "King" Carl Hubbell and "Prince" Hal Schumacher. Majority owner John 
McGraw retired as manager in 1932 after 30 years at the helm, naming his 
protégé, young star first baseman Bill Terry, recently the last .400 hitter 
in the National League, as his player-manager successor. Somewhat similarly, 
former superstar hurler Walter Johnson also retired in 1932 as Senator 
manager in favor of young star shortstop Joe Cronin as their new player-manager. 
(McGraw watched the Series from the stands, and died four months later.) 
The Senators were the surprise team of 1933, breaking a seven-year monopoly 
on the AL title jointly held by the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Athletics 
from 1926 to 1932. But this could also be called a joint 13-year monopoly 
by all three, since the Senators had also won in 1924 and 1925 and the 
Yankees won from 1921 to 1923. NL New York Giants (4) vs. AL Washington

1933 World Series (4–1): New York Giants (N.L.) over Washington Senators 
(A.L.) Washington, D.C. has not hosted another World Series since 1933. 
In 2012, the Washington Nationals, formerly the Montreal Expos, brought 
back postseason play to D.C. for the first time in 79 years but blew the 
NLDS one strike away from eliminating the St. Louis Cardinals after their 
early 6–0 lead had evaporated. The Nats have yet to win a postseason series 
since their move, as their later October stints in 2014 and 2016 both ended 
in NLDS losses. (Montreal only made one postseason appearance, winning 
the 1981 National League Division Series that was created due to that season's 
players' strike.) This first Washington Senators franchise became the Minnesota 
Twins during the 1960–61 offseason, and would not reach the World Series 
again until 1965 as the Twins—since then, they have won two World Series, 
in 1987 and 1991. The second Washington Senators, inaugurated in 1961 to 
replace the first edition on its way to Minnesota, became the Texas Rangers 
in 1972, who were also defeated four games to one in their first World 
Series ever by the now San Francisco Giants in 2010, with both Series 77 
years apart starting in the Giants' home park and the Giants losing only 
Game 3 on the road in each. The Rangers were then defeated again in 2011 
by the St. Louis Cardinals. They had two chances to win in Game 6 when
