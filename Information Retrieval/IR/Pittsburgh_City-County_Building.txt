The Pittsburgh City-County Building is the seat of government for the City 
of Pittsburgh and houses both Pittsburgh and Allegheny County offices. 
It is located in Downtown Pittsburgh at 414 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
Built from 1915-17 it is the third seat of government of Pittsburgh. Today 
the building is occupied mostly by Pittsburgh offices with Allegheny County 
located in adjacent county facilities. In 1914, a competition was held 
for a new Pittsburgh City Hall. The 16-entry competition led to the commissioning 
of Edward B. Lee, a respected Pittsburgh architect, with Palmer, Hornbostel, 
& Jones as associated architects. The completed design was done by Hornbostel.[citation

G. Armstrong to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Pittsburgh's 1816 incorporation 
as a city. On the seventh floor of the building is a massive mural completed 
in 1940 entitled "Justice" by award winning artist Harry Scheuch.[1] 1922's
