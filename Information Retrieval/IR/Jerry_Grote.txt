Gerald Wayne Grote (born October 6, 1942) is an American former professional 
baseball player. He played the majority of his Major League Baseball career 
as a catcher for the New York Mets and was regarded as one of the best 
defensive catchers of his era.[1][2] Grote was raised in San Antonio, Texas. 
When he was ten years old, he and his family were caught in an F-4 tornado. 
His mother, father and two sisters made it to safety, however, he lost 
his grandmother in the storm.[3] Grote attended Douglas MacArthur High 
School, where he played on the baseball team as a pitcher, catcher and 
third baseman.[4] As a high school pitcher, he threw a no-hitter and a 
one hitter.[4] Grote played for Trinity University in 1962, and led the 
Tigers in batting average (.413), home runs (five), RBI (19), runs (29), 
and hits (31).[5] After one season at Trinity University, Grote was signed 
as an amateur free agent by the Houston Colt .45s in 1962, and was assigned 
to play for their minor league affiliate, the San Antonio Bullets.[4] At 
the age of 20, he made his major league debut with the Colt .45s on September 
21, 1963 as a late-inning defensive replacement for John Bateman, and hit 
a sacrifice fly to score Bob Aspromonte in his only at-bat.[6] For the 
season he appeared in three games, including on September 27, when every 
starter in the Colts' line-up was a rookie.[7] In 1964, Grote platooned 
with Bateman behind the plate; however, the Colts also experimented with 
young catchers Dave Adlesh and John Hoffman, as neither Grote nor Bateman 
hit for a very high average that season (.181 and .190, respectively).[4] 
Grote was the Colts' catcher on April 23, when Ken Johnson became the first 
pitcher in major league history to lose a complete game no-hitter in nine 
innings.[8] In 1965, the newly renamed Houston Astros remained unsettled 
behind the plate, with former All-Star Gus Triandos and prospect Ron Brand 
being added to the mix. Grote spent the entire season with Houston's Triple 
A Pacific Coast League affiliate, the Oklahoma City 89ers, where he batted 
.265 with eleven home runs. At the end of the season, he was traded to 
the New York Mets for pitcher Tom Parsons.[9] Grote became the starting 
catcher for the Mets immediately upon his arrival in New York City. Though 
he batted only .237 with three home runs in 1966, his handling of the Mets' 
young pitchers and his solid defensive skills were instrumental in helping 
the Mets avoid 100 losses and a last place finish for the first time in 
franchise history.[10] Grote earned a reputation with his teammates and 
opponents as highly competitive, developing the trademark of rolling the 
ball to the far side of the pitcher's mound (closest to the Mets' dugout) 
while leaving the field after his pitcher ended an inning with a strikeout. 
This necessitated the opposing team's pitcher having to walk further to 
stoop and retrieve the ball. In 1968, Grote was hitting over .300 at mid-season 
and was recognized as one of the top catchers in the National League when 
he was selected to be the starting catcher in the 1968 All-Star Game.[11][12] 
He became only the second Met player in franchise history after Ron Hunt 
to earn a starting role in an All-Star game.[13] Grote was hitless in two 
at-bats during the game.[12] He ended the year with a .282 batting average 
along with three home runs and 31 runs batted in.[1] The 1969 season would 
be a memorable one for Grote and the Mets. The Chicago Cubs had been in 
first place since the beginning of the season and had a nine-game lead 
as late as August 15.[14] However, the Cubs began to falter while the Mets 
continued to play well. When the two teams met for a two-game series on 
September 8, the Mets won both games to move just a half game behind the 
Cubs.[15] Aside from calling Tom Seaver's five-hit pitching performance 
in the second game, Grote drove in the Mets' seventh and final run of the 
game.[16] The following day, the Mets swept the Montreal Expos in a doubleheader, 
with Grote catching all 21 innings. Coupled with a Cubs loss, the Mets 
moved into first place for the first time in their history. The Mets stayed 
in the lead for the rest of the season, finishing with a 37-11 record in 
their final 48 games while the Cubs slumped to a 9-17 record in their final 
26 games, and clinched the National League Eastern Division title on September 
24.[17][18] Grote finished the season with a .252 average and produced 
career-highs with six home runs and 40 runs batted in, but it was his defensive 
skills that proved most valuable for the Mets.[1][19] Grote posted a .991 
fielding percentage and his 56.3% caught stealing percentage was second-best 
among National League catchers.[20] He was also given credit for guiding 
the Mets young pitching staff that led the league in victories and shutouts 
and finished second in team earned run average.[4][21] The Mets went on 
to sweep the Atlanta Braves in the 1969 National League Championship Series, 
but were heavy underdogs heading into the 1969 World Series against the 
Baltimore Orioles. Following a 4-1 loss in the series opener with Cy Young 
award winner Seaver on the mound, it seemed as if the Mets had little chance 
against the Orioles.[22] However, the Mets bounced back, winning the next 
four games to capture their first world championship.[23] Besides catching 
every inning in the post-season, Grote contributed offensively with a single 
in Game Two to keep a ninth inning rally alive and Al Weis followed with 
the game-winning hit.[24] With Game Four tied, Grote doubled to start the 
tenth inning, then pinch runner Rod Gaspar scored the winning run when 
an errant throw hit J.C. Martin on the wrist.[25] With Grote calling the 
pitches, the Mets pitching staff held the Orioles hitters to a .146 batting 
average during the series.[26] Grote and the 1969 Mets became an improbable 
part of baseball history. In their previous seven seasons the Mets had 
finished in last place five times. Their sudden turn of fortune in 1969 
and their subsequent upset victory in the World Series stunned the sports 
world and became one of the more storied events in baseball lore.[27] The 
team became known as the Miracle Mets.[27] Grote continued to provide the 
Mets with good defense, leading National League catchers in 1970 and 1971 
in putouts and in range factor.[28][29] In 1972, Grote played in only 64 
games due to injuries and in late September he had surgery to remove bone 
chips from his right elbow.[4] In May 1973, Grote broke a bone in his right 
arm when he was hit by a pitch and went on the disabled list for two months.[4] 
When he returned in mid-July, the Mets began winning, climbing from last 
place on August 30 to win the National League Eastern Division pennant.[18][30][31] 
They then proceeded to defeat the heavily favored Cincinnati Reds in the 
1973 National League Championship Series.[32] In the World Series, the 
Mets took the Oakland Athletics to the seventh and final game, before they 
were defeated.[33] As he had in 1969, Grote caught every inning of every 
post-season game for the Mets in 1973.[4] Looking back on his two pennant-winning 
seasons with the Mets, Grote said, "It (the 1969 season) was no miracle. 
Now, '73 was a miracle."[3] In 1974, Grote was batting .287 with four home 
runs and 27 runs batted in to earn his second All-Star selection, however, 
injuries were beginning to take their toll and he split the catching duties 
with Duffy Dyer.[4][34] Grote rebounded in 1975, posting a career-high 
.295 batting average in 119 games and led all National League catchers 
with a .995 fielding percentage.[1][35] At Veterans Stadium on July 4, 
1975, Grote stepped in as a pinch hitter against longtime teammate Tug 
McGraw, who had been traded to the Philadelphia Phillies during the off-season. 
With the Mets down 3-2, Grote connected for a game winning two run home 
run.[36] By the 1977 season, John Stearns had taken over as the Mets' starting 
catcher as back injuries continued to plague Grote and in August, after 
twelve seasons with the Mets, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers 
for two players to be named later.[37] Shortly after joining the Dodgers, 
Grote struck out in his only career at-bat against former battery-mate 
Tom Seaver, who was now with the Reds.[38] During his two seasons with 
the Dodgers, he played part-time as a backup to Steve Yeager and appeared 
in two World Series against the New York Yankees. He retired from professional 
baseball after the 1978 season, only to be lured out of retirement in 1981 
by the Kansas City Royals, who were experiencing a shortage of catchers.[39] 
On June 3, 1981, at the age of 38, Grote went 3 for 4 with a grand slam 
home run, a double, and a stolen base, driving in a team-record seven runs.[4] 
After another short stint with the Dodgers, he retired for good after the 
1981 season. In a sixteen-year major league career, Grote played in 1,421 
games, accumulating 1,092 hits in 4,339 at bats for a .252 career batting 
average along with 39 home runs and 404 runs batted in.[1] He ended his 
career with a .991 fielding percentage,[1] which at the time of his retirement 
was eighth highest all-time among catchers. On April 22, 1970, Grote set 
a major league record with 20 putouts in a game when Tom Seaver threw 19 
strikeouts against the San Diego Padres.[40][41] He is the Mets all-time 
leader in games played as a catcher (1,176).[42] Grote caught 116 shutouts 
in his career, ranking him 15th all-time among catchers.[43] Grote called 
the pitches for some of the most outstanding pitchers of his era, including 
Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, Tug McGraw, Nolan Ryan, Tommy John, Don Sutton, 
and Dan Quisenberry.[2] He possessed a strong and accurate throwing arm 
against opposing baserunners. Hall of Fame inductee Lou Brock found Grote 
to be one of the most difficult catchers on which to attempt a stolen base,[2] 
and though Hall of Fame catcher Johnny Bench was the perennial Gold Glove 
winner during their careers in the National League together, Bench once 
said of Grote, "If Grote and I were on the same team, I would be playing 
third base."[3] After his playing career had ended, Grote spent 1985 as 
manager of the Lakeland Tigers and the Birmingham Barons.[44] In 1989, 
he played for the St. Lucie Legends in the Senior Professional Baseball 
Association.[2] He was inducted into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame in 
1991, and the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1992.[45][46] In 1998, he was 
inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame.[47] On October 8, 2011, 
Grote was inducted into the Trinity University Athletic Hall of Fame.[5] 
After retirement, Grote continued to raise prize Texas longhorns on his 
ranch near Austin, Texas.[4] He appeared as a Mystery Guest on the television 
game show What's My Line?.[48] Grote can be heard as color commentator 
with Mike Capps on the Round Rock Express (PCL) radio home broadcasts (2010)--and 
on the Internet on MiLB.com. Grote and his wife learned Transcendental 
Meditation in August 1974. Of their practice Grote said, "it's like an 
instant seven or eight hours' sleep. … Because of it, my wife and I probably 
are more in love, closer, and more dependent on each other than we've ever
