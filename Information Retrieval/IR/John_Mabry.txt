John Steven Mabry (born October 17, 1970) is a former Major League Baseball 
player and broadcaster, and is currently the hitting coach for the St. 
Louis Cardinals. He had 898 career hits in 3409 at-bats (for a batting 
average of .263), with 96 home runs and 446 RBI. He is 6'4" tall, weighs 
210 lbs, bats left-handed and throws right-handed. Mabry, a graduate of 
Bohemia Manor High School, in Chesapeake City, Maryland, played three years 
at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, before being drafted by the 
St. Louis Cardinals in the 6th round of the 1991 amateur draft. During 
his fourteen-year MLB career Mabry played for eight teams, including three 
different stints with the Cardinals (1994–1998, 2001, 2004–2005).[1] In 
Mabry's only season with over 400 at bats, he led the Cardinals with 161 
hits and was fourth in the National League for first basemen in fielding 
percentage at .994 and was errorless in 14 games in the outfield. He hit 
for a natural cycle in a May 18, 1996 loss to the Colorado Rockies.[2] 
Mabry was one of the few major leaguers who preferred not to wear batting 
gloves. He was also somewhat versatile on defense, playing more than 100 
games at left and right field as well as first and third base. He also 
made two career appearances pitching with dubious results. In 1 inning 
of work he gave up 7 earned runs for a career ERA of 63.[3] In April, 2011, 
Fox Sports Midwest hired Mabry to serve as baseball analyst during St. 
Louis Cardinals live pre-game and post-game shows, a role he shared with 
former Cardinals Mike Matheny and Cal Eldred.[4] On December 2, 2011 the 
Cardinals named Mabry the assistant hitting coach to Mark McGwire in 2012, 
soon after announcing former teammate Mike Matheny would be the new manager.[5] 
On November 5, 2012, the Cardinals promoted Mabry to hitting coach following 
McGwire's departure to the Los Angeles Dodgers.[6] Former major league 
catcher Bengie Molina succeeded Mabry as the assistant hitting coach.[7] 
After his 2007 retirement as a player, Mabry continued to make his home 
in the St Louis area along with his wife Ann and their four children.[8] 
Long an avid outdoorsman, Mabry became a spokesman for Gander Mountain, 
making a series of videos on different aspects of hunting and fishing.[9]
