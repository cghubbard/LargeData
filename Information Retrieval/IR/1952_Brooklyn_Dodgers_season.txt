The 1952 Brooklyn Dodgers rebounded from the heartbreaking ending of 1951 
to win the National League pennant by four games over the New York Giants. 
However, they dropped the World Series in seven games to the New York Yankees. 
Led by Gil Hodges, Jackie Robinson, and Duke Snider, the high-powered Brooklyn 
offense scored the most runs in the majors. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
