Joaquín Árias (born September 21, 1984) is a Dominican professional baseball 
infielder who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
for the Texas Rangers, New York Mets, and San Francisco Giants. Árias signed 
with the New York Yankees as an international free agent in 2001. He batted 
.266 for the Battle Creek Yankees of the Class A Midwest League in 2003.[1] 
The Texas Rangers acquired Árias on March 23, 2004, completing a trade 
made 36 days earlier on February 16 that sent Alex Rodriguez to the New 
York Yankees for Alfonso Soriano.[2] Among five Yankees prospects offered 
to the Rangers, Árias was selected over Robinson Canó because he was a 
more polished defender and two years younger.[1] Árias made his Major League 
debut with the Rangers on September 13, 2006, drawing a walk. Árias was 
designated for assignment on August 24, 2010[3] and traded to the New York 
Mets on August 31 for Jeff Francoeur.[4] On November 4, 2010, Árias was 
claimed off waivers by the Kansas City Royals,[5] but the Royals designated 
Árias for assignment on December 19 to make room on the 40-man roster for 
the prospects acquired in the Zack Greinke trade.[6] The San Francisco 
Giants signed Árias to a minor league contract on December 15, 2011. After 
spending the 2012 Spring training with the Giants, he was assigned to Fresno 
Grizzlies, Giants' Triple-A affiliate, on April 5. He played 18 games for 
the Grizzlies, hitting .400 with 2 home runs and 17 runs batted in (RBIs). 
The Giants called up Árias on April 25.[7] Árias hit his first major-league 
home run in his 331st career major-league at-bat on May 22, 2012. The two-run 
homer off Milwaukee Brewers starting pitcher Shaun Marcum gave San Francisco 
a 4–0 lead in the 4th inning of a game the Giants would go on to win by 
a score of 6–4.[8] On June 13, 2012, playing third base, Árias fielded 
the ball and threw to first base for the final out of Matt Cain's perfect 
game.[9] On August 22, 2012, he accumulated a single-game career high of 
five RBIs.[10] In total Árias appeared in 112 games of the 2012 regular 
season, batting .270 with 5 home runs and 34 RBIs. He was also hit by pitches 
a team-high 5 times.[11] The Giants finished the 2012 season as World Series 
Champions. During the postseason Árias appeared in 12 games, all of them 
as a mid- to late-inning replacement. On October 10, during the Division 
Series against the Cincinnati Reds, Árias entered the game in the fourth 
inning and had two hits in three times at bat. Both hits were doubles, 
after both of which Árias eventually scored runs in a game the Giants won 
8–3. Overall for the postseason, Árias went 3-for-8 (.375) with three runs 
scored.[12] On June 24, 2013, Árias left a game against the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in the second inning with a left hamstring injury after scoring 
from second base on a double by Enoc Mora.[13] The injury only sidelined 
Árias for a little over a week and he took the field for the Giants against 
the Cincinnati Reds on July 3.[14] However, his return proved to be short-lived 
when he required an emergency appendectomy late on the night of July 7. 
The following day the Giants placed him on the 15-day disabled list.[15] 
He was re-activated and returned to the team on July 26.[16] Árias started 
47 games, appeared in 102 games, batting .271 with 19 RBIs.[17] On January 
23, 2014, Árias and the Giants agreed on a two-year, $2.6-million contract.[17] 
Árias appeared in 107 games, batting .254 with 15 RBIs. In the 2014 postseason, 
Árias appeared in 8 games, batting 2-for-4 with one RBI and two runs scored, 
as the Giants won the 2014 World Series. On April 28, 2015, Árias hit 3-for-3 
off Clayton Kershaw, becoming the first Giant get three hits off Kershaw 
in one game.[18] Árias appeared in 40 games, batting .207, before being 
designated for assignment on July 27.[19] Árias cleared waivers and was 
assigned to the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats.[20] On December 13, 2015, 
Arias signed a minor league deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[21] He
