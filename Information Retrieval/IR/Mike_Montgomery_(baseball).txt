Michael Paul Montgomery (born July 1, 1989) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). Montgomery 
was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the first round of the 2008 MLB 
draft, and made his MLB debut with the Seattle Mariners in 2015. Montgomery 
was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the first round, with the 36th 
selection, of the 2008 MLB Draft out of William S. Hart High School in 
Santa Clarita, California. He rated the Royals sixth-best prospect by MLB.com.[when?] 
In 2012 he posted a combined record of 5–12 in 27 starts while splitting 
the season between the Royals' Double A and Triple A clubs.[1] On November 
20, 2012 the Royals added Montgomery to the 40-man roster in anticipation 
of the upcoming Rule 5 Draft of Minor League players.[1] On December 9, 
2012, Montgomery was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays (along with Jake Odorizzi, 
Patrick Leonard and Wil Myers) in exchange for James Shields and Wade Davis.[2] 
He was optioned to AAA on March 11, 2013.[3] On March 31, 2015, Montgomery 
was traded to the Seattle Mariners for Erasmo Ramírez.[4] After an injury 
sidelined James Paxton, the Mariners called Montgomery up to the majors 
for the first time on June 2, 2015. He started that night against the New 
York Yankees at Safeco Field, giving up one run, four hits, and walking 
two while striking out four and leaving after six innings with a 2–1 lead. 
He was on track to earn his first major league win, but Mariners closer 
Fernando Rodney gave up a run with two outs in the ninth inning to blow 
the save and deny Montgomery the win in a game that the Yankees would go 
on to win 5–3 in 11 innings.[5] On June 23, 2015, Montgomery became the 
first Mariners left-handed pitcher to ever throw a complete game shutout 
with 10 strikeouts and no walks, getting the win against the Kansas City 
Royals 7–0.[6][7] Following his first career complete game shutout, Montgomery 
pitched his second consecutive shutout on June 30, 2015. He allowed one 
hit, a double in the 7th inning, to the San Diego Padres in a 5–0 win.[8] 
He is the first Mariners pitcher since Freddy García in 2001 to throw complete 
game shutouts in consecutive starts. On August 30, 2015, Montgomery was 
sent back down to the Tacoma Rainiers. He made the Mariners' opening day 
roster in 2016 as a reliever. On July 20, 2016, the Mariners traded Montgomery 
and Jordan Pries to the Chicago Cubs for Dan Vogelbach and Paul Blackburn. 
Mike Montgomery came in as a relief pitcher in the bottom of the 10th inning
