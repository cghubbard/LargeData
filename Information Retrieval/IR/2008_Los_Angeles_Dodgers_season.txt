The 2008 Los Angeles Dodgers season featured the Dodgers celebrating their 
Golden Anniversary in Southern California under new manager Joe Torre as 
they won the National League West for the first time since 2004, and returned 
to the postseason after missing the playoffs in 2007. They swept the Chicago 
Cubs in the NLDS to advance to the NLCS. It was their first playoff series 
win since 1988 when they went on to win the World Series. However, they 
lost to the Philadelphia Phillies in five games in the NLCS. Infielders

selected 45 players in this draft. Of those, eleven of them would eventually 
play Major League baseball. The first round pick was right handed pitcher 
Ethan Martin from Stephens County School in Toccoa, Georgia. He was traded 
to the Philadelphia Phillies in 2012 (along with this year's second round 
pick, pitcher Josh Lindblom) and made his Major league debut for the Phillies 
in 2013. The fourth round pick, shortstop Dee Gordon became an All-Star 
as the Dodgers second baseman in 2014, when he also led the league in steals.
