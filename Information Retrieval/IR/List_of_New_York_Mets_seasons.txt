The New York Mets are an American professional baseball team based in Flushing, 
Queens, New York City. They compete in the East Division of Major League 
Baseball's (MLB) National League (NL). The team's current home stadium 
is Citi Field, after playing two years at the Polo Grounds and 45 years 
at Shea Stadium.[1] Since their inception in 1962, the Mets have won two 
World Series titles and five NL championships. As of the end of the 2016 
season, the Mets have won more than 4,200 regular season games, a total 
that ranks 20th among MLB teams and fourth among expansion teams.[2] The 
Mets lost 120 games in their inaugural season, the most by a post-1900 
MLB team.[3] After six more years in which their best league finish was 
ninth, the Mets won the World Series in 1969, defeating the Baltimore Orioles 
in five games to earn what is widely considered one of the biggest upsets 
in baseball history.[4][5] Four seasons later, the Mets returned to the 
World Series, where they lost to the Oakland Athletics in seven games. 
After winning two NL championships in five years, New York struggled for 
the next decade, not coming within 10 games of the NL East leader until 
1984. In 1986, the team posted 108 wins, the most in franchise history, 
and defeated the Houston Astros in the National League Championship Series 
(NLCS) to advance to the World Series. Trailing three games to two in the 
series, the Mets were one out from defeat in game six before coming back 
to win 6–5; they won game seven two days later to earn their second World 
Series championship.[6] After a second-place finish in 1987, the Mets won 
the NL East the next year, but lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS. 
The Mets' next playoff appearances were their back-to-back wild card-winning 
seasons of 1999 and 2000; in the latter year, they won their fourth NL 
championship, but lost to the cross-town New York Yankees in the "Subway 
Series".[7] The 2006 Mets earned an NL East title, before the St. Louis 
Cardinals defeated them in the NLCS. In 2007 and 2008, the team was eliminated 
from playoff contention on the last day of the regular season.[8] The Mets 
won the NL East in 2015, and swept the Chicago Cubs in four games to win 
the NLCS and advance to the World Series for the first time since 2000;[9] 
they lost the Series to the Kansas City Royals in five games. In the most 
recent season, 2016, the Mets again advanced to the playoffs, but were 
eliminated in the NL Wild Card Game. Note: Statistics are correct as of
