Adam Thomas Kennedy (born January 10, 1976) is an American former Major 
League Baseball second baseman. He played for the Oakland Athletics, Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Washington Nationals, Seattle Mariners, Los 
Angeles Dodgers and had two stints with the St. Louis Cardinals. Kennedy 
was born in Riverside, California. He attended J.W. North High School in 
Riverside, playing baseball and basketball.[1] He is the son of Tom Kennedy, 
who teaches Health at North High School. He attended Cal State Northridge, 
where he played shortstop for the Matador baseball squad. He set school 
records in career hits, RBI and batting average and was a three-time All-American. 
He led the nation in hits as a sophomore and junior. Kennedy was drafted 
in the first round (twentieth overall) by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 
1997 MLB draft. In 1999 with the Memphis Redbirds he hit .327 with 10 home 
runs and 63 RBI. He was selected as a Pacific Coast League All-Star, Baseball 
America first-team Minor League All-Star and Triple-A All-Star He made 
his major league debut on August 21, 1999 for the Cardinals against the 
New York Mets at second base. He was hitless in four at-bats in that game. 
His first Major League hit was a three RBI double to left field on August 
22 off of Orel Hershiser of the Mets. His first home run came on August 
31 against Brian Meadows of the Florida Marlins. He appeared in 33 games 
for the Cards with a .255 batting average that season. Kennedy was traded 
the following year to the Anaheim Angels with Kent Bottenfield for Jim 
Edmonds. Kennedy matched a team record with eight RBI against the Blue 
Jays on April 18, 2000. It was the most RBI by any rookie in one game since 
Fred Lynn drove in 10 for the Boston Red Sox in 1975. In Game 5 of the 
2002 American League Championship Series against the Minnesota Twins, Kennedy 
hit three home runs, joining only seven other players who hit three homers 
in a post-season game: Babe Ruth, Bob Robertson, Reggie Jackson, George 
Brett, Adrián Beltré, Albert Pujols, and Pablo Sandoval. Kennedy's performance 
helped the Angels clinch the American League pennant, and Kennedy was named 
the series' Most Valuable Player. The Angels went on to beat the San Francisco 
Giants in seven games in the World Series, earning Kennedy a World Series 
ring. The 2002 campaign established Kennedy as a fixture in the Angels 
infield. However, his declining offensive performance put his status with 
the club in flux. Before the 2006 season trade deadline, it was rumored 
that Kennedy would be traded, most notably for Shea Hillenbrand. While 
the rumors never came to fruition, Kennedy was forced to share the starting 
second base position, playing in a platoon with rookie Howie Kendrick for 
the remainder of the season. The national spotlight shone briefly on Kennedy 
on August 16, 2006, when he took part in a bench-clearing brawl in the 
ninth inning of a game between the Texas Rangers and the Angels. Tensions 
between the two division rivals were already high, as two Rangers starting 
pitchers — Adam Eaton and Vicente Padilla — had been ejected in previous 
games that month for throwing at Angels batters. Also, two Angels hurlers 
(Kevin Gregg and Brendan Donnelly) had already been thrown out of the game 
for hitting batters, and manager Mike Scioscia and bench coach Ron Roenicke 
had been ejected as well. Rangers pitcher Scott Feldman hit Kennedy in 
the buttocks with a fastball with only one out remaining in the game, and 
his team up 9–3.[2] Kennedy charged the mound, triggering a fight between 
the 6' 5" Feldman and the 6' 1" Kennedy.[3] As Kennedy charged him, Feldman 
stood on the mound and threw down his glove, and when Kennedy reached him 
Feldman then hit Kennedy in the armpit with a punch.[3] Kennedy was suspended 
for four games for his actions. In seven seasons with the Angels, Kennedy 
hit .280 in 992 games, with 51 home runs and 353 RBI. On November 28, 2006 
he signed a 3-year, $10 million contract with his former team, the St. 
Louis Cardinals. On August 11, 2007, Kennedy was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list with a torn medial meniscus in his right knee, an injury that would 
sideline him for the remainder of the season.[4] He was in 87 games prior 
to the injury, and hit only .219. In 2008, he played in 115 games and hit 
.280. On February 9, 2009, after a year of demanding a trade due to his 
unfulfilled desire for a starting role on the Cardinals,[5] Kennedy was 
released by the team.[6] He signed a minor league deal with the Tampa Bay 
Rays one week later.[7] The Rays assigned him to the AAA Durham Bulls, 
his first minor league action since 2005. With the Bulls, he hit .280 in 
23 games. On May 8, 2009, he was traded to the Oakland Athletics for Joe 
Dillon and was assigned to Triple-A Sacramento.[8] His contract was purchased 
the next day. He appeared in 129 games for the Athletics, mostly at third 
base and second base, batting .289 with 11 home runs.[9] On February 12, 
2010, Kennedy signed with the Washington Nationals.[10] He played in 135 
games for the Nationals, hitting .249. He mostly played second base, but 
also appeared in 51 games at first base, the first time he had seen any 
regular time at that position in his career. On January 10, 2011, he signed 
a minor-league deal with the Seattle Mariners.[11] Kennedy, however, made 
the team out of spring training, and served as a utility infielder, seeing 
action at first base, second base and third base during the year while 
hitting .234 in 114 games. Midway through the season he replaced former 
Angels teammate Chone Figgins as the starting third baseman. He elected 
free agency on October 30. On December 1, 2011, Kennedy signed a one-year 
contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers.[12] In 86 games with the Dodgers, 
mostly as a pinch hitter (with occasional starts at second and third), 
Kennedy hit .262. A strained right groin put him on the disabled list and 
ended his season early, on September 11.[13] After his playing career ended,
