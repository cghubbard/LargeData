Robert Allen "R.A." Dickey (born October 29, 1974) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He has previously played in MLB for the Texas Rangers, Seattle Mariners, 
Minnesota Twins, New York Mets, and Toronto Blue Jays. After limited success 
in the majors as a conventional starting pitcher, Dickey learned to throw 
a knuckleball. As of the 2016 season, he is one of only two active players 
in the majors who use the knuckleball as a primary pitch. In 2012, Dickey 
was selected to his first All-Star Game, won the Sporting News Pitcher 
of the Year Award, and became the first knuckleball pitcher to win the 
Cy Young Award. Dickey attended Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville, Tennessee. 
He was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 10th round (277th overall) 
of the 1993 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign. Dickey attended 
the University of Tennessee, where he played college baseball for the Tennessee 
Volunteers baseball team in the Southeastern Conference. He majored in 
English literature at Tennessee, where he had a 3.35 GPA and was named 
Academic All-American.[1] He was also named Academic All-SEC.[2] Dickey 
was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the first round (18th overall) of the 
1996 Major League Baseball draft. After being drafted by the Rangers, Dickey 
was initially offered a signing bonus of $810,000, before a Rangers team 
physician saw Dickey's throwing (right) arm hanging oddly in a picture 
of him with other Team USA players in Baseball America. The Rangers subsequently 
did further evaluation of Dickey, leading to the discovery of a missing 
ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow joint, and reduced their offer 
to $75,000.[3][4] Dickey has been quoted as saying, "Doctors look at me 
and say I shouldn't be able to turn a doorknob without feeling pain,"[3] 
making his ability to pitch somewhat remarkable. Dickey debuted with the 
Rangers in 2001. "His stuff was dime-a-dozen, though: a high-80's fastball, 
an occasional fringy breaking ball, and a forkball he dubbed 'The Thing.'"[4] 
The start of the 2004 season was thought to be a turning point in Dickey's 
career, as he managed to compile a 4–1 record through his first five starts. 
This hot streak was short-lived, however, and he ended up finishing the 
season a disappointing 6–7 with a 5.61 ERA.[5] Throughout his career, Dickey 
did not know that his "forkball" pitch was actually a hard knuckleball, 
but by 2005, Dickey had realized that the best way to extend his career 
was to perfect the pitch.[3] At the beginning of the 2006 season, the Rangers 
gave Dickey a chance to try out his knuckleball at the major league level 
by naming him the 5th starter. However, after giving up 6 home runs in 
his first start on April 6, tying the modern era baseball record with another 
knuckleballer, Tim Wakefield, he was demoted to the Rangers' Triple-A minor 
league affiliate, the Oklahoma RedHawks. On January 13, 2007, he signed 
a minor league deal with the Milwaukee Brewers and spent the 2007 season 
with the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. After finishing the season with a 12–6 
record and a 3.80 ERA, Dickey was named the Pacific Coast League Pitcher 
of the Year.[6] Dickey became a minor league free agent after the season. 
On November 28, 2007, he signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota 
Twins that included an invitation to spring training, but was claimed in 
the Rule 5 draft by the Seattle Mariners on December 6, 2007. On March 
29, 2008, the Mariners traded minor league catcher Jair Fernandez to the 
Twins to retain the rights for Dickey and initially optioned him to Triple-A 
Tacoma, recalling him to the major league club on April 14.[7] On August 
17, 2008, Dickey tied the record for most wild pitches in an inning, with 
four. This came against the Minnesota Twins in the fifth inning. He joins 
four others, including Hall of Famers Walter Johnson and Phil Niekro, who 
have accomplished this feat.[8] In 2008, he led the majors in games started 
with fewer than five days of rest, with six.[9] He became a free agent 
after the season after refusing a minor league assignment. On December 
23, 2008, Dickey signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring 
training with the Minnesota Twins.[10] He would go on to pitch in 35 games 
for the Twins in 2009. On January 5, 2010, Dickey signed a minor league 
contract with the New York Mets, receiving an invitation to spring training.[11] 
He was assigned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons to begin the season. While 
playing for the Bisons, Dickey threw a one-hitter on April 29. He gave 
up a single to the first batter, and then retired the next twenty-seven 
in a row.[12] On May 19, 2010, the New York Mets purchased Dickey's contract 
from the Buffalo Bisons, and he made his first appearance as a Met against 
the Washington Nationals on the same day. In his debut for the Mets, Dickey 
pitched well, going six innings, giving up five hits, two earned runs, 
and striking out two, but received a no-decision. His next start, May 25 
against the Philadelphia Phillies, he went six innings again, giving up 
9 hits, walking 3 and striking out 7 in an 8–0 shutout for his first victory 
as a Met. On August 13, 2010, Dickey threw a complete game one-hit shutout 
of the Philadelphia Phillies — the only hit being a single surrendered 
to Phillies starting pitcher Cole Hamels.[13] Dickey finished the 2010 
season with a very strong ERA of 2.84, which was 7th best in the National 
League and 10th in all of baseball, and served as a rare bright spot on 
an otherwise disappointing season for the Mets.[14] In 2010, Dickey posted 
career highs in Games Started (26), wins (11), complete games (2), innings 
pitched (174.1), strikeouts (104), ERA (2.84), WHIP (1.19), and BAA (.252). 
On January 29, 2011, Dickey agreed to a two-year contract with the Mets. 
Under the agreement, Dickey received a $1 million signing bonus, $2.25 
million in 2011, and $4.25 million in 2012. In addition, the Mets had a 
$5 million option for 2013 with a $300,000 buyout.[15] His 2011 season 
was followed in the documentary film Knuckleball!.[16][17] During the 2011 
season, Dickey posted career bests in game starts (32), innings pitched 
( 208 2⁄3) and strikeouts (134). He finished the year with a record of 
only 8–13, despite a 3.28 ERA that was 12th best in the National League.[18] 
Dickey's performance in the first half of 2012 drew comparisons to some 
of the most dominant pitching streaks of the last 50 years.[19] Mets Manager 
Terry Collins remarked, "I've never seen anything like this. Never. I've 
seen some dominant pitching, but nothing like what he's going through right 
now."[20] Hall of Fame Pitcher and fellow knuckleballer Phil Niekro commented 
on Dickey, "I had a few streaks, but nothing like he's going through. I 
don't know if any other knuckleballer has ever been on a hot streak like 
he has been. He is just dynamite right now."[21] Dickey recorded double-digit 
strikeouts in back-to-back games in May,[22][23] becoming the first Mets 
pitcher to do so since Pedro Martínez in 2006. Over the two games, Dickey 
allowed one run in 14 1⁄3 innings for an ERA of 0.63, and he was named 
National League Player of the Week for the week ending May 27, 2012.[24] 
In Dickey's next two starts, he pitched 16 1⁄3 innings, allowing no runs. 
During his next outing on June 13, Dickey allowed only one hit, struck 
out a career-high 12 batters, and walked none, facing only 29 total batters 
to lead the Mets to a 9–1 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays. The only hit 
was an infield single by B.J. Upton on a play where third baseman David 
Wright tried to barehand the ball but failed to field it cleanly. The Mets 
formally appealed the official scorekeeping of the only hit allowed to 
be changed to an error on Wright, but MLB denied the appeal.[25] Dickey 
was the first pitcher in the major leagues to reach 10 wins in 2012.[26] 
In his next start, Dickey pitched a complete game one-hit shutout against 
the Orioles, becoming the first pitcher since Dave Stieb in 1988 to throw 
two consecutive one-hitters.[27] He also became only the third pitcher, 
after Sandy Koufax and Nolan Ryan, to have two complete game one-hitters 
with 12 or more strikeouts in one season, and the only pitcher to do it 
in back-to-back starts.[citation needed] During this streak, Dickey set 
a new Mets franchise record of 32 2⁄3 consecutive scoreless innings, besting 
Jerry Koosman's 31 2⁄3 in 1973.[28] On July 1, 2012, Dickey was named to 
the National League All-Star team. He was also honored with being the National 
League Pitcher of the Month after going 5–0 with a 0.93 ERA for the month 
of June.[29] On August 31, Dickey pitched his third complete game shutout 
of his year. The win marked the first time a Met pitcher had reached 17 
wins since Al Leiter in 1998.[30] Dickey won his 20th game of the season 
on September 27, 2012, tying his career high with 13 strikeouts.[31] For 
the 2012 season, Dickey set new career bests in games started (33), wins 
(20), complete games (5), shutouts (3), innings pitched ( 233 2⁄3), strikeouts 
(230), ERA (2.73), WHIP (1.05), and BAA (.226). Dickey won the NL Cy Young 
Award, beating out Gio Gonzalez of the Nationals and Clayton Kershaw of 
the Dodgers. He became the first knuckleballer in MLB history to win the 
award.[32] He also became the third Met pitcher to win the award, joining 
Tom Seaver (1969, 1973, and 1975) and Dwight Gooden (1985).[33] On December 
16, 2012, the Mets agreed to trade Dickey to the Toronto Blue Jays (along 
with Josh Thole and Mike Nickeas) in exchange for Travis d'Arnaud, John 
Buck, Noah Syndergaard and Wuilmer Becerra, contingent upon his agreeing 
to a contract extension with the Blue Jays.[34] The two sides agreed on 
December 17 to a two-year, $25-million extension with a club option for 
a third year in 2016 at $12 million; the deal became official once he passed 
his physical.[35][36] On February 5, 2013, manager John Gibbons said Dickey 
would be the opening day starter for the Blue Jays.[37] Dickey lost his 
first start for his new team, giving up four runs and five hits in six 
innings in a loss to the Cleveland Indians. Dickey pitched his first complete 
game and shutout as a Blue Jay in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays on 
June 26.[38] Dickey would finish his first season as a Blue Jay with a 
record of 14–13, an ERA of 4.21, and 177 strikeouts over 224 2⁄3 innings 
pitched. On October 25, Dickey was announced as a finalist for the AL Pitcher's 
Gold Glove, along with teammate Mark Buehrle and Detroit Tigers pitcher 
Doug Fister.[39] He was awarded the 2013 Pitcher's Fielding Bible on October 
28, 2013,[40] and was announced as the AL Pitcher's Gold Glove Award winner 
on October 29. Dickey led all American League pitchers with 40 assists 
and 7 defensive runs saved, and yielded only 8 stolen bases.[41] Dickey 
began the 2014 season with a 4–4 record and a 4.20 ERA through his first 
10 starts. On May 24, he won his fifth game of the season, 5–2 over the 
AL West-leading Oakland Athletics. In doing so, he lowered his ERA to 3.95, 
the first time in his tenure as a Blue Jay in which his ERA has been below 
4.[42] On June 27, Dickey recorded his 1,000th career strikeout, coming 
against Tyler Flowers of the Chicago White Sox. He would start the final 
game of the Blue Jays season on September 28, against the Baltimore Orioles, 
and would pitch 6 innings and yield only 1 run, but Toronto would lose 
1–0. Dickey finished the season with a 14–13 record, 3.71 ERA, 173 strikeouts, 
and a 1.23 WHIP in 34 starts totaling 215 2⁄3 innings.[5] Dickey opened 
the 2015 season as the number two starter in the Jays rotation. On June 
18, he made his first start against the Mets since being traded in 2012, 
and pitched 7 1⁄3 innings in a 7–1 win. Dickey was placed on the bereavement 
list the following day after it was revealed that his father, Harry Lee 
Dickey, had died on June 16.[43] At the All-Star break, Dickey had a 3–10 
record and a 4.87 ERA.[44] He would turn his season around after the break, 
and earned his 100th career win on September 25.[45] Dickey pitched a little 
over ninety-nine innings after the All-Star break, fourth most in the American 
League, resulting in eight wins with only one loss, 6th best in the AL. 
His ERA was a meagre 2.80 over that period, which would have tied him for 
the best in the American League with Justin Verlander (50 inning minimum), 
had it not been for two other Jays starters, Marco Estrada, with a 2.78 
ERA, and David Price, at 2.55. Overall Dickey finished the season with 
an 11–11 record, 3.91 ERA, and 126 strikeouts in 214 1⁄3 innings pitched.[5] 
He made his postseason debut on October 12, starting game 4 of the ALDS 
against the Texas Rangers. At 40 years of age, Dickey became the oldest 
player in MLB history to make his postseason debut, pitching 4 2⁄3 innings 
before he was relieved by David Price, who would go on to earn the win.[46] 
On November 3, Dickey's $12 million option for 2016 was exercised by the 
Blue Jays.[47] During the offseason, he underwent surgery to repair a tear 
in his right meniscus.[48] Dickey had an up-and-down 2016 campaign, closing 
the regular season with a 10–15 record, 4.46 ERA, and 126 strikeouts over 
169 2⁄3 innings.[5] Due to the acquisition of Francisco Liriano at the 
trade deadline, Dickey made only three pitching appearances in September.[49] 
With the Blue Jays only needed four starters for the playoffs, Dickey was 
left off of the postseason roster in favor of Marcus Stroman, Aaron Sanchez, 
Marco Estrada, and J. A. Happ. Dickey became a free agent at the conclusion 
of the 2016 season.[50] On October 27, Dickey was named a finalist for 
the pitchers Gold Glove Award, along with Justin Verlander and Dallas Keuchel.[51] 
On November 10, 2016, Dickey signed a one-year, $7.5 million contract with 
the Atlanta Braves that includes an $8 million club option for the 2018 
season, with a $500,000 buyout.[52] Dickey relies primarily on the knuckleball. 
He uses the pitch around 80% of the time. His repertoire is rounded out 
by two-seam and four-seam fastballs (82–85 mph) and a rare changeup (76–78 mph).[53] 
Dickey's knuckleball comes in two forms — a "slow" knuckler in the low-to-mid 
70s that has been clocked as low as 54 mph, and a "fast" one in the upper 
70s, sometimes reaching as fast as 83 mph. Dickey tends to use the slow 
knuckleball when he is behind in the count, using the fast one when he 
is ahead.[54] However, he resorts to a fastball in most 3–0 and 3–1 counts.[53] 
Dickey was a member of the 1996 US Olympic Baseball team that won a bronze 
medal in Atlanta. Dickey started two games, recording wins in both.[55] 
17 years later, Dickey once again pitched for Team USA in the 2013 World 
Baseball Classic. He started two games, going 0–1 with a 5.00 ERA. Dickey 
is married and has two daughters and two sons.[2] A born-again Christian, 
he helps operate the Ocala, Florida-based Honoring the Father Ministries 
which provides medical supplies, powdered milk and baseball equipment to 
the impoverished in Latin America.[62] A 2010 New York Times article reported 
that Dickey is an avid reader and that at the time, the stack of books 
in his locker included Life of Pi by Yann Martel and a collection of works 
by C. S. Lewis. Dickey has said that if he had not become a professional 
athlete, he would have become an English professor.[63] Dickey named his 
bats for literary swords--Orcrist the Goblin Cleaver (from The Hobbit) 
and Hrunting (from Beowulf).[64] Dickey mixed up Orcrist and Sting when 
explaining the origin of the name.[65][66] In addition to his fantasy-named 
bats, Dickey's at-bat introduction song is the theme from Game of Thrones.[67] 
In November 2011, Dickey announced that he would risk his 2012 season salary 
($4,250,000) to attempt to climb Mount Kilimanjaro; he credits this aspiration 
to his boyhood reading of Hemingway's The Snows of Kilimanjaro.[68] While 
climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro, he set out to raise awareness of the issue of 
human trafficking in India. His climb was in support of an organization 
called "Bombay Teen Challenge" that ministers to victims of human trafficking 
and their children in the heart of the red-light districts. Dickey returned 
from this trip in January 2012 with Mets bullpen catcher Dave Racaniello 
and the Cleveland Indians starting pitcher Kevin Slowey, and together raised 
over $100,000. His autobiography, Wherever I Wind Up: My Quest for Truth, 
Authenticity and the Perfect Knuckleball, written along with New York Daily 
News reporter Wayne Coffey, was released in 2012.[69] In the book, Dickey 
reports suffering sexual abuse as an 8-year-old child by a 13-year-old 
female babysitter, and later by a teenage male, and discusses his struggles 
with suicidal thoughts as an adult.[70] In September 2012, Dial Press announced 
a deal with Dickey to publish three books, including a children's version 
of his memoir, which is scheduled for the fall of 2013.[71] On June 20, 
2012, it was reported that Dickey was helping coach an 18-year-old knuckleball 
pitcher from Long Island, helping him become a walk-on pitcher for the
