Dennis Martínez National Stadium (Spanish: Estadio Nacional Dennis Martínez) 
is located in Managua, Nicaragua. It was named after former MLB player 
Dennis Martínez. The stadium was built in 1948 and is Nicaragua's national 
stadium. It is used mainly for baseball but also serves as a venue for 
concerts, boxing, football, religious events and has a capacity of 30,100 
people.[1] It is the home stadium of Indios del Bóer baseball team and 
Deportivo Walter Ferretti football team. Inside the stadium is a hall of 
fame near the entrance showing medals, cups, photos and memories of Nicaraguan 
players. There is also a gym located inside.[2] The stadium has been renamed 
three times.[3] Built in 1948, it was originally named "El Estadio Nacional" 
(The National Stadium). After the 1972 earthquake that struck Managua and 
destroyed 90% of the city, it was rebuilt and renamed after Anastasio Somoza 
García. In 1979, after the Sandinistas overthrew the Somoza dynasty, it 
was renamed in honor of Rigoberto López Pérez,[4] the man who, in 1956, 
assassinated Anastasio Somoza García. On November 20, 1998, the 50th anniversary 
of the founding of the stadium, then-President Arnoldo Alemán issued a 
decree changing the stadium's name to Estadio Nacional Dennis Martínez.[5] 
Dennis Martínez,[6] was Major League Baseball's first Nicaraguan-born player.
