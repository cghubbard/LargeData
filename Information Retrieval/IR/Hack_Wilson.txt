Lewis Robert Wilson (April 26, 1900 – November 23, 1948) was an American 
Major League Baseball player who played 12 seasons for the New York Giants, 
Chicago Cubs, Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies.[1] Despite his 
diminutive stature, he was one of the most accomplished power hitters in 
the game during the late 1920s and early 1930s.[2] His 1930 season with 
the Cubs is widely considered one of the most memorable individual single-season 
hitting performances in baseball history. Highlights included 56 home runs, 
the National League record for 68 years; and 191 runs batted in, a mark 
yet to be surpassed. "For a brief span of a few years", wrote a sportswriter 
of the day, "this hammered down little strongman actually rivaled the mighty 
[Babe] Ruth."[3] While Wilson's combativeness and excessive alcohol consumption 
made him one of the most colorful sports personalities of his era,[4] his 
drinking and fighting undoubtedly contributed to a premature end to his 
athletic career and, ultimately, his premature demise.[5][6] He was inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979.[7] Lewis Robert Wilson was born 
April 26, 1900, in the Pennsylvania steel mill town of Ellwood City, north 
of Pittsburgh.[2] His mother, Jennie Kaughn, 16, was an unemployed drifter 
from Philadelphia; his father, Robert Wilson, 24, was a steel worker. His 
parents never married; both were heavy drinkers, and in 1907 his mother 
died of appendicitis at the age of 24.[8] In 1916 Lewis left school to 
take a job at a locomotive factory, swinging a sledge hammer for four dollars 
a week.[2] Although only five feet six inches tall, he weighed 195 pounds 
with an 18-inch neck, and feet that fit into size-five-and-one-half shoes. 
Sportswriter Shirley Povich later observed that he was "built along the 
lines of a beer keg, and was not wholly unfamiliar with its contents."[9] 
While his unusual physique was considered an oddity at the time,[10] his 
large head, tiny feet, short legs and broad, flat face are now recognized 
as hallmarks of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.[11][12] In 1921 Wilson moved 
to Martinsburg, West Virginia, to join the Martinsburg Mountaineers of 
the Class "D" Blue Ridge League.[13] After breaking his leg while sliding 
into home plate during his first professional game, he was moved from the 
catcher's position to the outfield.[14] In 1922 he met Virginia Riddleburger, 
a 34-year-old office clerk; they married the following year.[15] In 1923, 
playing for the "B" division Portsmouth Truckers, he led the Virginia League 
in hitting with a .388 batting average.[13][16] Late in the season, New 
York Giants manager John McGraw purchased his contract from Portsmouth 
for $10,500.[1] Wilson made his major league debut with the Giants on September 
29, 1923 and became the starting left fielder the following season.[17] 
By mid-July he was ranked second in the National League (NL) in hitting.[18] 
He ended the season with a .295 average, 10 home runs, and 57 runs batted 
in (RBIs) as New York won the NL pennant.[1] In the 1924 World Series he 
averaged only .233 in a seven-game loss to the Washington Senators.[19] 
Multiple stories exist to explain the origin of Wilson's nickname: By one 
account, a New York newspaper held a nicknaming contest; the winning entry 
was "Hack" because he reminded many fans of another stocky athlete, the 
popular wrestler Georg Hackenschmidt.[2] In another version, McGraw is 
said to have remarked that Wilson's physique was reminiscent of a "hack" 
(slang for taxicab in that era). Giants teammate Bill Cunningham claimed 
that the nickname was based on Wilson's resemblance to Hack Miller, an 
outfielder with the Chicago Cubs. The New York Times printed the first 
documented usage of "Hack" on June 10, 1924.[20] Early in the 1925 season 
Wilson hit the longest home run on record at Ebbets Field against the Brooklyn 
Robins,[21] but fell into a slump in May, and was replaced in left field 
by Irish Meusel.[22] On July 2 he hit two home runs in one inning, tying 
Ken Williams' major league record set in 1922,[23] but his hitting slump 
continued. In August McGraw told reporters that he had "...made the mistake 
of rushing [Wilson] along,"[24] and sent him to the Giants' minor league 
affiliate, the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association. At season's 
end, a front office oversight—or possibly, deliberate inaction[25]—left 
him unprotected on the Toledo roster, and the last-place Chicago Cubs acquired 
him on waivers.[26] "They let go the best outfielder I ever played alongside", 
said Giants right fielder Ross Youngs, "and they're going to regret it."[27] 
During the 1925 World Series — between the Senators and the Pittsburgh 
Pirates — Wilson's son, Robert, was born.[28] Wilson regained his form 
as the Cubs' center fielder in 1926, and he quickly became a favorite of 
Chicago fans.[29] On May 24 he hit the center field scoreboard with one 
of the longest home runs in Wrigley Field history as the Cubs came from 
behind to defeat the Boston Braves.[30] Later that evening he made news 
again when he was arrested during a police raid of a Prohibition-era speakeasy 
while trying to escape through the rear window,[31] and was fined one dollar.[32] 
He ended the season with a league-leading 21 home runs along with 36 doubles, 
109 RBIs, a .321 batting average, and a .406 on-base percentage.[1] The 
Cubs improved to fourth place, and Wilson ended the year ranked fifth in 
voting for the NL's Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award.[33] Another strong 
performance followed in 1927 as Wilson once again led the league in home 
runs. Although the Cubs were in first place heading into the final month 
of the season, the team faltered and again finished fourth.[34] Wilson 
posted a .318 average with 30 home runs and 129 RBIs,[1] and led NL outfielders 
with 400 putouts.[35] He led the NL in home runs for a third consecutive 
year in 1928 with 31, along with 120 RBIs and a .313 average as the Cubs 
improved to third place.[1] Wilson had a combative streak and sometimes 
initiated fights with opposing players and fans. On June 22, 1928, a near-riot 
broke out in the ninth inning at Wrigley Field against the St. Louis Cardinals 
when Wilson jumped into the box seats to attack a heckling fan.[36] An 
estimated 5,000 spectators swarmed the field before police could separate 
the combatants and restore order.[36] The fan sued Wilson for $20,000, 
but a jury ruled in his favor.[37] The following year he took offense at 
a remark by Cincinnati Reds pitcher Ray Kolp, and – upon reaching first 
base after hitting a single – he charged into the Reds dugout, punching 
Kolp several times before they could be separated.[38] Later that evening 
at the train station, Wilson exchanged words and blows with Cincinnati 
player Pete Donohue.[38] In late 1929 he signed a contract to fight Art 
Shires of the Chicago White Sox in a boxing match,[39] but reneged after 
Cubs president William Veeck, Sr. enlisted Hack's wife Virginia to dissuade 
him,[40] and then Shires lost a fight to George Trafton of the Chicago 
Bears. There was nothing to gain, Wilson said, by fighting a defeated boxer.[41] 
Wilson's "penchant for festivities" is also well documented. Biographer 
Clifton Blue Parker described him as "... the Roaring '20s epitome of a 
baseball player, primed for an age of American excess ... at a time when 
baseball was America's favorite sport."[42] His love of drinking and partying 
did not endear him to Cubs owner William Wrigley, who abhorred alcohol 
consumption. (Wilson always insisted that he never played drunk; "hung 
over, yes; drunk, no."[32]) Manager Joe McCarthy worked hard to shield 
Wilson from Wrigley, and to keep him on an even keel. "Better than any 
other manager", wrote sportswriter Frank Graham, "Joe understood Hack, 
made allowances for him when he failed, and rewarded him with praise when 
he did well. Joe could be strict and stern with his players ... but he 
never was with Hack, and Hack repaid him by playing as he never had before, 
nor would again."[43] In 1929 Wilson hit .345 with 39 home runs and a league-record 
159 RBIs.[1][2] He and new teammate Rogers Hornsby (who also contributed 
39 home runs) led the Cubs to their first NL pennant in eleven years. In 
the World Series against Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, Wilson's 
.471 hitting performance was eclipsed by two fielding errors at Shibe Park. 
Though trailing the Series two games to one, the Cubs were leading by a 
score of 8–0 in the fourth game when the Athletics mounted a 10-run rally 
in the seventh inning. Wilson lost two fly balls in the sun; the second, 
with two runners on base, led to an inside-the-park home run by Mule Haas 
as the Athletics won 10–8.[44][45] After the game, McCarthy reportedly 
told a boy asking for a souvenir baseball, "Come back tomorrow and stand 
behind Wilson, and you'll be able to pick up all the balls you want!"[46][47] 
The Athletics won again the next day to take the Series in five games.[48] 
Wilson's 1930 season, aided by a lively ball wound with special Australian 
wool, is considered one of the best single-season hitting performances 
in baseball history.[2][49] By the middle of July he had accumulated 82 
RBIs. In August he hit 13 home runs and 53 RBIs, and by September 15 he 
had reached 176 RBIs, breaking Lou Gehrig's major league record established 
three years earlier.[2] He ended the season with 190, along with an NL-record 
56 home runs, .356 batting average, .454 on-base percentage, and league-leading 
.723 slugging percentage.[1] He was unofficially voted the NL's most "useful" 
player by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (which did not inaugurate 
its official MVP award until 1931).[50] In 1999 the Commissioner of Baseball 
officially increased Wilson's 1930 RBI total to 191 after a box score analysis 
by baseball historian Jerome Holtzman revealed that Charlie Grimm had been 
mistakenly credited with an RBI actually driven home by Wilson during the 
second game of a doubleheader on July 28.[51] Wilson's 191 RBIs remains 
one of baseball's most enduring records; only Gehrig (184) and Hank Greenberg 
(183) ever came close, and there have been no serious challenges in the 
last 75 years. (The best recent effort was 165 by Manny Ramirez in 1999.)[52] 
Reds catcher Clyde Sukeforth asserted that Wilson should have been credited 
with an additional home run in 1930 as well. "He hit one in Cincinnati 
one day", he said, "way up in the seats, hit it so hard that it bounced 
right back onto the field. The umpire had a bad angle on it and ruled that 
it had hit the screen and bounced back. I was sitting in the Cincinnati 
bullpen, and of course, we weren't going to say anything. But Hack really 
hit 57 that year."[53] Wilson's official total of 56 stood as the NL record 
until the 1998 season, when it was broken by Sammy Sosa (66) and Mark McGwire 
(70).[54] Wilson's success in the 1930 season served only to fuel his drinking 
habits, and in 1931 he reported to spring training 20 pounds overweight.[2] 
In addition, the NL responded to the prodigious offensive statistics of 
the previous year (the only season, other than 1894, in which the league 
as a whole batted over .300[55]) by introducing a heavier ball with raised 
stitching to allow pitchers to gain a better grip and throw sharper curveballs.[56] 
Wilson complained that the new Cubs manager, former teammate Rogers Hornsby, 
did not allow him to "swing away" as much as Joe McCarthy had.[57] He hit 
his 200th career home run at Ebbets Field on June 18 — only the fourth 
player ever to do so, behind Ruth, Cy Williams, and Hornsby[58] — but then 
fell into a protracted slump, and was benched in late May.[59] By late 
August Wrigley publicly expressed his desire to trade him.[60] On September 
6 he was suspended without pay for the remainder of the season after a 
fight with reporters aboard a train in Cincinnati.[61] He was hitting .261 
with only 13 home runs (his 1930 production during August alone) at the 
time.[1] In December 1931, the Cubs traded Wilson, along with Bud Teachout, 
to the St. Louis Cardinals for Burleigh Grimes.[1] Less than a month later, 
the Cardinals sent him to the Brooklyn Dodgers for minor league outfielder 
Bob Parham and $25,000.[1] Wilson hit .297 with 23 home runs and 123 RBIs 
for Brooklyn in 1932. He began 1933 with a ninth-inning game-winning pinch-hit 
inside-the-park grand slam home run at Ebbets Field—the first pinch-hit 
grand slam in Dodger history, and only the third inside-the-park pinch-hit 
grand slam in MLB history.[62] By season's end his offensive totals had 
dropped substantially, and he was hitting .262 when the Dodgers released 
him mid-season in 1934.[1][63] The Philadelphia Phillies signed him immediately, 
but after just two hits in 20 at bats he was released again a month later.[64] 
After a final season with the Albany Senators of the Class "A" New York–Pennsylvania 
League, Wilson retired at the age of 35.[13] In a 12-year major league 
career, Wilson played in 1,348 games and accumulated 1,461 hits in 4,760 
at-bats for a .307 career batting average and a .395 on-base percentage. 
He hit 244 home runs and batted in 1,063 runs, led the NL in home runs 
four times, and surpassed 100 RBIs six times. Defensively, he finished 
his career with a .965 fielding percentage.[1] Wilson returned to Martinsburg 
where he opened a pool hall, but encountered financial problems due to 
a failed sporting goods business venture, and then a rancorous divorce 
from Virginia.[2][65] By 1938 he was working as a bartender near Brooklyn's 
Ebbets Field where he sang for drinks, but had to quit when customers became 
too abusive.[66] A night club venture in suburban Chicago was another financial 
failure.[67] In 1944 he took a job as a good will ambassador for a professional 
basketball team in Washington, D.C., where he lamented that fans remembered 
his two dropped fly balls in the 1929 World Series far more vividly than 
his 56 home runs and 191 RBIs in 1930.[68] Unable to find work in professional 
baseball, he moved to Baltimore where he worked as a tool checker in an 
airplane manufacturing plant and later as a laborer for the City of Baltimore. 
When municipal authorities realized who he was, he was made the manager 
of a Baltimore public swimming pool.[69] On October 4, 1948 Wilson was 
discovered unconscious after a fall in his home.[70] Though the accident 
did not appear serious at first, pneumonia and other complications developed 
and he died of internal hemorrhaging on November 23, 1948, at the age of 
48.[4] Wilson — once the highest-paid player in the National League[71] 
— died penniless; his son, Robert, refused to claim his remains. NL President 
Ford Frick finally sent money to cover his funeral expenses.[72][73] His 
gray burial suit was donated by the undertaker.[71] In marked contrast 
to Babe Ruth's funeral, which had been attended by thousands just three 
months earlier, only a few hundred people were present for Wilson's services.[74] 
He was buried in Rosedale Cemetery in the town where he made his professional 
playing debut, Martinsburg, West Virginia.[74] Ten months later Joe McCarthy 
organized a second, more complete memorial service, attended by Kiki Cuyler, 
Charlie Grimm, Nick Altrock and other players from the Cubs and the Martinsburg 
team (by then renamed the Blue Sox). A granite tombstone was unveiled, 
with the inscription, "One of Baseball's Immortals, Lewis R. (Hack) Wilson, 
Rests Here."[75][76] One week before his death, Wilson gave an interview 
to CBS Radio which was reprinted in Chicago newspapers. In 1949 Charlie 
Grimm, the Cubs' new manager, posted a framed excerpt from that interview 
in the Cubs clubhouse, where it remains.[3] It reads, in part: "Talent 
isn't enough. You need common sense and good advice. If anyone tries to 
tell you different, tell them the story of Hack Wilson. ... Kids in and 
out of baseball who think because they have talent they have the world 
by the tail. It isn't so. Kids, don't be too big to accept advice. Don't 
let what happened to me happen to you."[77] In 1979 Wilson was inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee.[78] A Martinsburg 
street is named Hack Wilson Way in his honor,[79][80] and the access road 
to a large city park within his home town, Ellwood City, Pennsylvania,
