The National Football League (NFL) was founded in 1920 as the American 
Professional Football Association (APFA) with ten teams from four states, 
all of whom existed in some form as participants of regional leagues in 
their respective territories; it took on its current name in 1922. The 
NFL was the first professional football league to successfully establish 
a nationwide presence, after several decades of failed attempts. Only two 
teams currently in the NFL, the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) 
and the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), are founding members.[1] 
The Green Bay Packers, founded 1919 (joined the NFL in 1921), is the oldest 
NFL franchise in continuous operation with the same name in the same location.[2] 
League membership gradually stabilized throughout the 1920s and 1930s as 
the league adopted progressively more formal organization. The first official 
championship game was held in 1933. The NFL stopped signing black players 
in 1927 but reintegrated in 1946 following World War II. Other changes 
followed after the war; the office of league President evolved into the 
more powerful Commissioner post, mirroring a similar move in Major League 
Baseball. Teams became more financially viable, the last team folding in 
1952 and the league absorbing teams from the briefly more successful All-America 
Football Conference in 1950, two of which survive to the present day. By 
1958, when that season's NFL championship game became known as "The Greatest 
Game Ever Played", the NFL was on its way to becoming one of the most popular 
sports leagues in the United States. The rival American Football League 
was founded in 1960. It was very successful, and forced a merger with the 
older NFL that resulted in a greatly expanded league and the creation of 
the Super Bowl, which has become the most-watched annual sporting event 
in the United States. The league continued to expand to its current size 
of 32 teams. A series of labor agreements during the 1990s and increasingly 
large television contracts has helped keep the league one of the most profitable 
in the U.S., and the only major league in the U.S. since 1990 to avoid 
a work stoppage that resulted in the loss of regular-season games. Football 
was first professionalized in 1892, when William Heffelfinger and Ben "Sport" 
Donnelly each received a large sum of cash to play for the Allegheny Athletic 
Association of the Western Pennsylvania Senior Independent Football Conference. 
Through the 1890s and the early part of the 20th century, professional 
football was primarily a regional sport, with most informal circuits centered 
around a single state or region with only limited play outside state lines. 
There were no national leagues or tournaments for the professional game, 
despite numerous attempts: an earlier National Football League (backed 
by what would become Major League Baseball) was unable to expand beyond 
Pennsylvania in 1902, the New York City-based World Series of Pro Football 
tournament disbanded after two seasons and lack of fan interest, and other 
attempts to either combine existing circuits or create new ones from scratch 
never materialized. By the late 1910s, the regional circuits had coalesced 
into more or less leagues of varying degrees of organization. One of the 
most prominent at the time was the Ohio League, which boasted the services 
of legendary Native American athlete Jim Thorpe, among other stars. Another 
was the somewhat lower-caliber, but better-organized, New York Pro Championship; 
two of the New York circuit's best teams, the Rochester Jeffersons and 
the Buffalo All-Stars, went on a barnstorming tour of Ohio in 1917. After 
the Jeffersons played, and lost badly to, Thorpe's Canton Bulldogs in a 
1917 match, Jeffersons owner Leo Lyons (believing that the foundation of 
a league could build a sport that rivaled baseball, which then held an 
effective monopoly on professional sport, in popularity) suggested to Thorpe 
that a league be formed.[3] Lyons' vision of a national league of existing 
football clubs (which, at the time, was competing with another proposed 
league, again backed by baseball) was cut short by the United States' entry 
into World War I and further hampered by a flu pandemic in 1918, which 
forced most of the Ohio League teams to suspend operations due to either 
travel restrictions or loss of players to the war effort. New York's teams, 
although they were forced to reduce their schedules, continued and (along 
with the few other remaining teams that survived the suspension, including 
the OL's Dayton Triangles and Michigan's Detroit Heralds) picked up many 
of the stars that remained stateside. This had the effect of spreading 
out the talent across a broader geographic area. Over the course of 1919, 
as professional football had increased in parity, teams began reaching 
out and participating in more barnstorming tours. By then, two informal 
but distinct interstate circuits had developed: one around the Eastern 
Seaboard (particularly New York City, New Jersey and Philadelphia) that 
played mostly on Saturdays due to blue laws, and another centered around 
the Midwestern region (Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio, and 
upstate New York) that played on Sundays. It was the latter that formed 
the basis of what would eventually become the modern National Football 
League. Ohio's teams went along with the idea in the face of escalating 
costs: several bidding wars in the early 1900s, both in Pennsylvania and 
Ohio, had damaged the sport significantly, and another bidding war was 
about to erupt if something was not done. By forming a national league, 
teams reasoned that it would eliminate the practices of looting other teams' 
rosters and concentrating top talent in only a few teams, thus distributing 
talent more evenly and efficiently thereby reducing costs for each individual 
team while still keeping a top-level product on the field. On August 20, 
1920, at a Hupmobile dealership in Canton, Ohio, the league was formalized, 
originally as the American Professional Football Conference, initially 
consisting only of the Ohio League teams, although some of the teams declined 
participation.[4] One month later on September 17, the league was renamed 
the American Professional Football Association, adding Buffalo and Rochester 
from the New York league, and Detroit, Hammond (a suburban Chicago squad), 
and several other teams from nearby circuits. The eleven founding teams 
initially struck an agreement over player poaching and the declaration 
of an end-of-season champion. Thorpe, while still playing for the Bulldogs, 
was elected president. Only four of the founding teams finished the 1920 
schedule and the undefeated Akron Pros claimed the first championship. 
Membership of the league increased to 22 teams – including more of the 
New York teams – in 1921, but throughout the 1920s the membership was unstable 
and the league was not a major national sport. On June 24, 1922, the organization, 
now headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, changed its title a final time to 
the National Football League.[5] Two charter members, the Chicago Cardinals 
(now the Arizona Cardinals) and the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears), 
are still in existence. The Green Bay Packers franchise, founded in 1919, 
is the oldest team not to change locations, but did not begin league play 
until 1921. The New York Football Giants joined in 1925, followed by the 
Portsmouth Spartans in 1930, relocating to Detroit in 1934 to become the 
Lions.[6] The Indianapolis Colts franchise traces its history through several 
predecessors, including one of the league's founding teams – the Dayton 
Triangles – but is considered a separate franchise from those teams and 
was founded as the Baltimore Colts in 1953. Although the original NFL teams 
representing Buffalo, Cleveland, Chicago and Detroit no longer exist, replacement 
franchises have since been established for those cities. Early championships 
were awarded to the team with the best won-lost record, initially rather 
haphazardly, as some teams played more or fewer games than others, or scheduled 
games against non-league, amateur or collegiate teams; this led to the 
title being decided on a tiebreaker in 1921, a disputed title in 1925, 
and the scheduling of an impromptu indoor playoff game in 1932. The lack 
of a firm league structure meant that numerous teams regularly were added 
and removed from the league each year; a franchise owner might trade in 
his franchise in one city for one in another (as was the case with the 
Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland Bulldogs and Detroit Wolverines), and if a larger-market 
or more established team wanted a player on a smaller-market upstart, it 
could buy out the team outright and fold it to gain rights to that player, 
as the New York Giants did to the Wolverines in 1928 to get Benny Friedman. 
In league meetings prior to the 1933 season, three new teams, the Pirates, 
the Cincinnati Reds and the Eagles, were admitted to the NFL.[7][8] Ten 
teams were then in the NFL and, at George Preston Marshall's urging, with 
Halas' support, NFL was reorganized into an Eastern Division and a Western 
Division. In the Eastern Division were the Philadelphia Eagles, Brooklyn 
Dodgers, New York Giants, Boston Redskins, and the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
In the Western Division were the Chicago Bears, Portsmouth Spartans, Chicago 
Cardinals, Green Bay Packers, and the Cincinnati Reds. Furthermore, the 
two owners convinced the league to have the two division winners meet in 
a NFL Championship Game.[9] By 1934, all of the small-town teams, with 
the exception of the Green Bay Packers, had moved to or been replaced by 
teams in big cities, and even Green Bay had begun to play a portion of 
its home schedule in much larger Milwaukee for more support (a practice 
they continued well into the 1990s). In 1941, the corporate headquarters 
moved from Columbus, Ohio to Chicago. During the early years of the league, 
rather than coming up with original team names, many NFL teams simply chose 
the name of the Major League Baseball team in the same city. Thus the Pittsburgh 
Steelers were the "Pittsburgh Pirates" for the first seven years of existence 
and other teams such as the Brooklyn Dodgers, Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati 
Reds, Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, Washington Senators and Buffalo 
Bisons all represented the NFL at one time or another.[10] An annual draft 
of college players was first held in 1936.[11][12] The first televised 
NFL game was on October 22, 1939 in a game the Eagles lost 23-14 to the 
host Dodgers at Ebbets Field.[13][14] It was during this era, however, 
that the NFL became segregated: there were no black players in professional 
football in the United States between 1933 and 1945, mainly due to the 
influence of George Preston Marshall, who entered the league in 1932 as 
the owner of the Boston Braves. Other NFL owners emulated Marshall's whites-only 
policy to mollify southern fans, and even after the NFL's color barrier 
had been broken in the 1950s, Marshall's Washington Redskins remained all-white 
until forced to integrate by the Kennedy administration in 1962.[15] Despite 
his bigotry, Marshall was selected as a charter member of the NFL-inspired 
Pro Football Hall of Fame, primarily for the numerous innovations (fixed 
schedules, separate conferences and championship games) Marshall encouraged 
during his time in the league. College football was the bigger attraction, 
but by the end of World War II, pro football began to rival the college 
game for fans' attention. Rule changes and innovations such as the T formation 
led to a faster-paced, higher-scoring game. The league also expanded out 
of its eastern and midwestern cradle; in 1945, the Cleveland Rams moved 
to Los Angeles, becoming the first big-league sports franchise on the West 
Coast.[16] In 1950, the NFL accepted three teams – the Cleveland Browns, 
San Francisco 49ers, and Baltimore Colts – from the defunct All-America 
Football Conference, expanding to thirteen clubs. For a three-month period 
in 1950 the league was renamed the National-American Football League, that 
was subsequently changed back.[17][18] In 1958, the Baltimore Colts and 
New York Giants played "The Greatest Game Ever Played" for the championship. 
Being the first nationally televised football game, along with its thrilling 
ending greatly increased the popularity of the NFL. Through these breakthroughs, 
pro football finally earned its place as a major sport. The NFL's precursor, 
the American Professional Football Association, had several minority players, 
including African-American players: between 1920 and 1926, nine black players 
suited up for NFL squads. It was also common, due to the number of talented 
players that were produced by the Carlisle Indian School's football team, 
to see teams (both inside and outside the NFL) openly market Native Americans; 
in fact, the Oorang Indians of 1922 to 1923 consisted entirely of Native 
American talent. Running back Walter Achiu and quarterback Arthur Matsu, 
both of the Dayton Triangles, were the first Asian-American players in 
the NFL, having joined the league in 1927 and 1928 respectively. Ignacio 
Molinet and Jess Rodriguez were the first Hispanic players in the NFL and 
each played one season in 1927 and 1929 respectively. However, since Carlisle 
had closed in 1918, the talent pool of Indians had dried up. Meanwhile, 
all black players in the NFL (including future Hall of Famer Fritz Pollard) 
were summarily kicked out prior to the 1927 season for reasons unexplained. 
From 1928 to 1932, no more than one black player could be found in the 
league each season, and none played more than two seasons. In 1933, there 
were two: Joe Lillard and Ray Kemp. Lillard was kicked off the Chicago 
Cardinals for fighting, while Kemp left to pursue what would become a successful 
coaching career. The moves left the league as all-white, and Boston Redskins 
owner George Preston Marshall allegedly used his pressure to keep it that 
way for the next several years, though each team's internal politics and 
cronyism, as well as the rising tide of racism in the United States as 
a whole, also played a significant role. Even during the wartime years, 
when much of the NFL's talent was overseas fighting World War II, players 
such as Kenny Washington who stayed in the United States were still passed 
up in favor of white players with normally debilitating medical conditions 
such as partial blindness.[citation needed] NFL integration occurred only 
when the Cleveland Rams wanted to move to Los Angeles, and the venue, the 
Los Angeles Coliseum, required them to integrate their team. They then 
signed two black players, Kenny Washington and Woody Strode.[19] Other 
NFL teams eventually followed suit, but Marshall refused to integrate the 
Redskins until forced to by the Kennedy administration as a pre-condition 
for using D.C. Stadium (now RFK Stadium). In spite of this open bias, Marshall 
was elected to the NFL's Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963. In 1946, the 
Cleveland Browns of a rival Professional Football league, the All-America 
Football Conference, signed two black players. By 1960, the NFL's new competitor, 
the American Football League, actively recruited players from smaller predominantly 
black colleges that had been largely ignored by the NFL, giving those schools' 
black players the opportunity to play professional football. Early AFL 
teams averaged more blacks than did their NFL counterparts.[20] However, 
despite the NFL's previous segregationist policies, the clear competitive 
advantage of AFL teams with liberal signing policies affected the NFL's 
drafts. By 1969, a comparison of the two leagues' championship team photos 
showed the AFL's Chiefs with 23 black players out of 51 players (45%) pictured, 
while the NFL's Vikings had 11 blacks, of 42 players (26%) in the photo. 
Chiefs players have been quoted as saying that one motivating factor in 
their defeat of the Vikings in Super Bowl IV was their pride in their diverse 
squad. Recent surveys have shown that the current, post-merger NFL is approximately 
67–71% non-white (this includes African Americans, Polynesians, non-white 
Hispanics, Asians, and people that are mixed race), significantly higher 
than the national average; certain positions, such as cornerback and running 
back, are almost entirely black. In 1946, after World War II, the struggling 
league had headquarters in Chicago. Commissioner Elmer Layden could not 
handle the pressure of the AFL set up in the same year. DeBenneville Bert 
Bell was hired to be the commissioner, and he accepted the office only 
on condition that the headquarters would move to Philadelphia.[21] Bell 
had played for the Eagles, and for Penn before that. Till 1959, when he 
died of a heart attack at Steelers–Eagles game at Franklin Field, the headquarters 
of NFL were on Walnut Street in Philadelphia, and Bert Bell had transformed 
the NFL into a commercial and popular success. Within a short period of 
his death, the NFL offices were moved to Manhattan, where they remain to 
this day. The NFL held a monopoly on professional football in the United 
States for most of the 1950s, a rare occurrence for a league that had at 
least one competing league in every year since 1934. By 1960, a group of 
potential professional football owners that would become known as the Foolish 
Club had become frustrated with their efforts to buy into the NFL (some 
were NFL franchise minority owners such as Harry Wismer and Ralph Wilson; 
others, such as Lamar Hunt and Bud Adams, had tried but failed to buy NFL 
teams) and formed a new league, the American Football League. It was the 
eighth professional football league to use the name and the fourth to be 
universally considered a major-league competitor to the NFL. The AFL would 
prove to be the NFL's most formidable challenger to date. By the middle 
of the 1960s competition for players, including separate college drafts, 
was driving up player salaries. In 1965, in the most high-profile such 
contest and a major boost to the AFL, University of Alabama quarterback 
Joe Namath signed with the New York Jets rather than the NFL's St. Louis 
Cardinals for a then-record $427,000. In 1966, the NFL's New York Giants 
broke an informal agreement and signed placekicker Pete Gogolak, who was 
under contract to the AFL's Buffalo Bills. Then AFL Commissioner Al Davis 
embarked on a campaign to sign players away from the NFL, especially quarterbacks, 
but behind the scenes a number of NFL team owners began action to end the 
detrimental rivalry. Several NFL franchises led by Cowboys General Manager 
Tex Schramm asked to meet with AFL owners to negotiate a merger. In an 
agreement brokered by Schramm and AFL founder Lamar Hunt, the two leagues 
announced their merger deal on June 8, 1966. The leagues would thenceforth 
hold a Common Draft and an end-of-season World Championship Game between 
the two league champions (later known as the Super Bowl and reverting to 
simply an NFL championship game). Still another city received an NFL franchise 
thanks to the AFL, as New Orleans was awarded an NFL team after Louisiana's 
federal Congressmen pushed for the passage of Public Law 89-800, which 
permitted the merger and exempted the action from Anti-Trust restrictions. 
The monopoly that would be created needed to be legitimized by an act of 
Congress. In 1970, the leagues fully merged under the name National Football 
League and divided into two conferences of an equal number of teams. Since 
the pre-merger NFL had six more teams than the AFL, three NFL teams – the 
Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns, and Baltimore Colts – moved to the 
AFC, the conference containing the AFL teams. Two other teams, the Seattle 
Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, were also added to the NFL as part of 
the merger agreement. (These two teams were not added until 1976; during 
the early 1970s, there were some concerns that several of the newly transplanted 
teams did not have stadiums big or modern enough to accommodate the NFL, 
and Seattle and Tampa Bay unsuccessfully attempted to court teams such 
as the Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots to their cities. Once the Bills 
and Patriots built new stadiums and solidified their place in their home 
markets, the NFL awarded Seattle and Tampa Bay expansion franchises of 
their own.) There was also a financial settlement, with the AFL teams paying 
a combined $18 million over 20 years. Although the AFL's identity was subsumed 
by the NFL, the NFL eventually adopted many of the AFL's innovations including 
the on-field game clock, names on player jerseys, recruiting at small and 
predominantly black colleges, gate and television revenue-sharing, establishment 
of southern franchises, and more wide-open offensive rules. Unlike previous 
armed conflicts such as World War I and World War II, both of which effectively 
stopped or dramatically reduced the amount of professional football played 
in the United States, both the AFL and NFL were largely unaffected by the 
Vietnam War and did not lose a significant number of players to the war 
draft. There is at least one recorded incidence of the NFL using champagne 
units to keep its players from being sent overseas (the Dallas Cowboys 
used the Texas Air National Guard's 147th Fighter Interceptor Group, a 
well-known champagne unit to shield seven Cowboys players from combat in 
Vietnam).[22] Bob Kalsu, then a player with the AFL's Buffalo Bills, left 
the team to serve in Vietnam and died in combat, becoming the first (and, 
until Pat Tillman's death in Afghanistan over 30 years later, only) active 
NFL or AFL player to die in war during his playing career. In the 1970s 
and 1980s, the NFL solidified its dominance as America's top spectator 
sport,[citation needed] and its important role in American culture. The 
Super Bowl became an unofficial national holiday and the top-rated TV program 
most years. Monday Night Football, which first aired in 1970, brought in 
high ratings by mixing sports and entertainment. Rule changes in the late 
1970s ensured a fast-paced game with lots of passing to attract the casual 
fan. The World Football League was the first post-merger challenge to the 
NFL's dominance, and in 1974, successfully lured some top NFL talent to 
its league and prompted a few rules changes in the NFL. However, financial 
problems led the league to fold halfway through its 1975 season. Two teams, 
the Birmingham Vulcans and Memphis Southmen, made unsuccessful efforts 
to move from the WFL to the NFL. The founding of the United States Football 
League in the early 1980s was the biggest challenge to the NFL in the post-merger 
era.[citation needed] The USFL was a well-financed competitor with big-name 
players and a national television contract. However, the USFL failed to 
make money and folded after three years. The USFL filed a successful anti-trust 
lawsuit against the NFL, but the remedies were minimal, and mismanagement 
(most notably, a planned move of its niche spring football season to a 
head-to-head competition in the fall) led to the league's collapse.[citation 
needed] 2001 saw the establishment of the XFL, an attempt by Vince McMahon 
and NBC, which had lost the NFL broadcast rights for that year, to compete 
with the league; the XFL folded after just one season.[23] Unlike the WFL 
and USFL, the XFL had no impact on the NFL's rules or franchise locations 
(its attempts at innovations were often ridiculed, though one innovation, 
the above the field Skycam which originated in the XFL, became a regular 
part of NFL telecasts), but a few NFL players used the XFL to relaunch 
their careers. The United Football League, which began play in 2009, had 
originally planned to take a direct challenge to the NFL with NFL-comparable 
salaries and teams in New York City and Los Angeles, but the UFL never 
did play in those cities (an ostensibly New York team played in Long Island 
and New Jersey), cut back its salaries, and instead opted for a complementary 
approach with teams in cities such as Las Vegas, Sacramento and Omaha; 
after four years, the UFL folded due to massive financial losses. Numerous 
other leagues have attempted to form over the years, but none have succeeded 
in having any level of competition comparable to the NFL (most never made 
it to their first game). On August 31, 2007, a story in USA Today unveiled 
the first changes to the league's shield logo since 1980, which took effect 
with the 2008 season.[24] The redesign reduced the number of stars in the 
logo from 25[24] (which were found not to have a meaning beyond being decorative) 
to eight (for each of the league's divisions), repositioned the football 
in the manner of the Vince Lombardi Trophy, and changed the NFL letters 
to a straight, serifed font. The redesign was created with television and 
digital media, along with clothing, in mind. The shield logo itself dates 
back to the 1940s. Shannon Eastin became the first woman to officiate a 
National Football League game in 2012, in a pre-season matchup between 
the Green Bay Packers and the San Diego Chargers.[25] In 2015 Sarah Thomas 
became the first full-time female official in National Football League 
history.[26] On March 3, 2013, Lauren Silberman became the first woman 
to ever try out for the National Football League when she appeared as a 
kicker at the NFL Regional Scouting Combine in Florham Park, New Jersey.[27][28] 
However, after two poor kicks, Silberman left the field, citing an injury 
to her quadriceps; the tryout was suspected by members of the press and 
public as being nothing more than a publicity stunt.[29] Olympic pole-vaulter 
Jenn Suhr publicly expressed interest in attending an NFL scouting combine 
in 2014, and at least one team (the Buffalo Bills) acknowledged Suhr's 
interest favorably but did not invite her to a combine; Suhr has not indicated 
what position she would play.[30] On July 27, 2015, the Arizona Cardinals 
hired Jennifer Welter as an assistant coaching intern for training camp 
and the preseason; as such, she is believed to be the first female coach 
in the NFL.[31][32] The Buffalo Bills hired Kathryn Smith as an assistant 
special teams coach for the 2016 season; Smith, who has long served as 
an assistant and front office staffer, will become the first full-time 
female assistant coach in the NFL.[33] While there have been a scattering 
of professional female football players in semi-pro football (Patricia 
Palinkas, Katie Hnida, and the still active Julie Harshbarger among them) 
and female players in college and high school football, no woman with prior 
experience as an American football player has attempted to make an NFL 
roster.[citation needed] In recent years, the NFL has expanded into new 
markets and ventures outside of the United States, beginning with a regular 
series of exhibition games known as the American Bowl, then with a European-based 
developmental league culminating in the now defunct NFL Europa, and starting 
in 2005 the league began hosting regular season games outside the United 
States, the first in Mexico City, Mexico, and then from 2007 hosting games 
London, England, and from 2008 in Toronto, Canada. The American Bowl games 
began in 1986 and continued until 2005 at various sites in countries around 
the world. Then in 1991, the league formed the World League of American 
Football, later known as NFL Europe and still later as NFL Europa, a developmental 
league that had teams in Britain, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands. 
The NFL shut down the program in June 2007. The league played a regular-season 
NFL game in Mexico City in 2005, the first-ever NFL regular season game 
held outside the United States, and marketed across the league as the Fútbol 
Americano game. On October 28, 2007, a regular season game between the 
Miami Dolphins and the New York Giants was held outside of North America 
for the first time in Wembley Stadium, the 90,000-seat national stadium, 
in London. It was a financial success with nearly 40,000 tickets sold within 
ninety minutes of the start of sales,[34] and a game-day attendance of 
over 80,000. In 2008, the New Orleans Saints and San Diego Chargers played 
at Wembley,[35] and in October 2009, the New England Patriots and Tampa 
Bay Buccaneers met.[36] In 2010, it was the Denver Broncos and the San 
Francisco 49ers that played in London. Starting from the 2008–09 season, 
building on league links with Toronto, the Buffalo Bills play an annual 
home game in Toronto's Rogers Centre, marketed by the team as the Bills 
Toronto Series.[37] In 2014, the Detroit Lions and the Atlanta Falcons 
played at Wembley Stadium. After 100 years of American football influence 
in Mexican territory, in 1998 the NFL opened a representation office in 
Mexico, called NFL México, as the NFL identified Mexico as a key market 
outside the United States due to proximity and tradition. The Mexican office 
handles sponsorship, licensing, detail dealers, sport culture, broadcasting, 
public relationships and community service.[38] In the early years, the 
league was not stable and teams moved frequently. Franchise mergers were 
popular during World War II in response to the scarcity of players. An 
example of this was the Steagles, temporarily formed as a merger between 
the Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles. Franchise moves became 
far more controversial in the late twentieth century when a vastly more 
popular NFL was free from financial instability and allowed many franchises 
to abandon long-held strongholds for perceived financially greener pastures. 
This was done in spite of the promises to Congress by Pete Rozelle in 1966 
that if the AFL–NFL merger were allowed, no city would lose its franchise. 
Those promises were made to ensure passage of PL 89-800, which granted 
anti-trust immunity to the merged professional football leagues. While 
owners invariably cited financial difficulties as the primary factor in 
such moves, many fans bitterly disputed these contentions, especially in 
Cleveland (the Rams and the Browns), Baltimore (the Colts), Houston (the 
Oilers), and St. Louis (the Cardinals), each of which eventually received 
teams some years after their original franchises left (the Browns, another 
Browns, Ravens, Texans, and Rams, respectively). Notably, the second-largest 
media market in the United States, Los Angeles, did not have an NFL team 
from 1994, after both the Raiders and the Rams relocated elsewhere, until 
2016, when the Rams returned. While baseball is known as "America's national 
pastime," football is the most popular spectator sport in the United States. 
According to the Harris Poll, professional football moved ahead of baseball 
as the fans' favorite in 1965, during the emergence of the NFL's challenger, 
the American Football League, as a major professional football league. 
Football has remained America's favorite sport ever since. In a Harris 
Poll conducted in 2008, the NFL was the favorite sport of as many people 
(30%) as the combined total of the next three professional sports – baseball 
(15%), auto racing (10%), and hockey (5%).[39] Additionally, football's 
American television viewership ratings now surpass those of other sports, 
although football season comprises far fewer games than the seasons of 
other sports.[40] However, the Harris Poll only allows one unaided selection 
of a "favorite sport." Other studies and polls such as the ESPN Sports 
Poll and the studies released by the Associated Press (AP) and conducted 
by Sports Marketing Group (SMG) from 1988 to 2004, show far higher levels 
of popularity for NFL football since they list from thirty to over 100 
sports that each respondent must rate. According to the AP, the SMG polls 
from 1988 to 2004 show NFL football to be the most popular spectator sport 
in America. The AP stated that "In the most detailed survey ever of America's 
sports tastes" researching "114 spectator sports they might attend, follow 
on television or radio or read about in newspapers or magazines, the NFL 
topped all sports with 39 percent of Americans saying they loved it or 
considered it one of their favorites."[41] In a 2003 study conducted by 
SMG and released by the AP, the NFL was loved or liked a lot by 42.8% of 
Americans over 18.[42][43] The NFL has the highest per-game attendance 
of any domestic professional sports league in the world. The NFL's overall 
attendance, however, is only approximately 20 percent of Major League Baseball, 
because of the latter's longer schedule (162-game scheduled regular season).[44] 
A 2007 Turnkey Sports & Entertainment's Team Brand Index for "team loyalty" 
ranked NFL teams in twelve of the top twenty-five spots out of 122 total 
between the four major sports leagues. The Pittsburgh Steelers and their 
fanbase had the top spot, while the New England Patriots, and Indianapolis 
Colts had the following two spots, followed by the New Orleans Saints at 
number seven and the Green Bay Packers and their fanbase ranked at number 
ten.[45] The Arizona Cardinals finished last in the entire survey of 122 
teams, though the survey was taken before the team's appearance against 
the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII. Buffalo Bills Miami Dolphins New England
