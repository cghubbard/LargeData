Alcides Escobar (al-SEE-dees esko-BAHR) (born December 16, 1986) is a Venezuelan 
professional baseball shortstop with the Kansas City Royals of Major League 
Baseball. He was born in La Sabana, Venezuela. He previously played for 
the Milwaukee Brewers. His defensive prowess has earned him the nickname 
"El Mago". Escobar was signed at age 16 as an international free agent 
by the Milwaukee Brewers in 2003 for $35,000.[1] In 2007, he split time 
between Single-A and Double-A, playing 63 games for the Brevard County 
Manatees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League and 62 games for 
the Huntsville Stars of the Class AA Southern League. He batted a combined 
.306 with one home run and 53 runs batted in. In 2008, Escobar played mostly 
for Huntsville. On September 1, 2008, when rosters expanded, Escobar was 
called up to the Majors for the first time and made his debut two days 
later as a defensive replacement at shortstop. He picked up his first hit 
in his first career at-bat in the same game, a single against Scott Schoeneweis 
of the New York Mets. Before the 2009 season, Baseball America rated Escobar 
the 19th best prospect in baseball. In 2009, Escobar appeared in the All-Star 
Futures Game as the starting shortstop for the World team. During the game, 
he went 2-for-4 and scored the go-ahead run. On August 12, Escobar was 
called up to the Brewers from the Triple-A Nashville Sounds to replace 
J. J. Hardy, who had been optioned down.[citation needed] He made his first 
major-league appearance of the season that night, pinch running for Prince 
Fielder in the bottom of the 9th against the San Diego Padres. Escobar 
stole second base, also advancing to third on a throwing error. After the 
end of the 2009 season, the Brewers traded Hardy to the Minnesota Twins, 
making Escobar the starting shortstop for the Brewers in 2010. Before the 
2010 season, Baseball America rated Escobar the 12th best prospect in baseball.[citation 
needed] On December 18, 2010, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals with 
Lorenzo Cain, Jeremy Jeffress, and Jake Odorizzi for Zack Greinke and Yuniesky 
Betancourt.[2] He is currently the starting shortstop for the Kansas City 
Royals. On March 15, 2012, Escobar signed a four-year, $10 million extension 
through 2015 with club options for 2016 and 2017 with the Royals. If both 
options are exercised, Escobar could earn $21.75 million. Escobar, who 
was slated to earn $519,500 in 2012, will instead earn $1 million in 2012 
and $3 million a year from 2013-2015. His 2016 option is worth $5.25 million 
and has a $500,000 buyout. His 2017 option is worth $6.5 million and has 
a $500,000 buyout.[3] The extension covers his final pre-arbitration season 
and his three arbitration-eligible seasons. The club options cover his 
first year of free agency.[4] In 2014, Escobar, along with Evan Longoria, 
Hunter Pence and Freddie Freeman were the only players in the MLB to start 
in all 162 regular season games for their respective teams.[5] He finished 
the season hitting .285, with 74 runs scored, 50 RBIs, and 31 stolen bases.[6] 
The Royals advanced to the 2014 World Series, where they lost to the San 
Francisco Giants in seven games. During the 2015 ALCS, Escobar set a postseason 
record by getting a leadoff hit in four consecutive games in the series. 
He was selected as the 2015 ALCS MVP as he batted .478 throughout the series.[7] 
In Game 1 of the 2015 World Series, Escobar hit an inside-the-park home 
run on the first pitch thrown by the New York Mets' Matt Harvey.[8] It 
was the first time any player had hit an inside-the-park home run in a 
World Series game since 1929. He followed by driving in two runs and scoring 
once on two hits in Game 2 as the Royals took a 7-1 victory and a 2-0 series 
lead.[9] In Game 5 of the World Series, the Royals were up 3 games to 1 
and Escobar hit a double in the 12th inning allowing the Christian Colon 
to score to help the Royals defeat the New York Mets 7-2 in twelve innings 
making the 2015 Kansas City Royals World Series Champions. In the 2015 
postseason, Escobar hit .329 with 70 at bats. He had 23 hits including 
four doubles and three triples, 13 runs scored, and 9 RBI.[10] He was awarded 
the 2015 Rawlings AL Gold Glove for shortstops on November 10, 2015.[11] 
On October 10, 2016, the Royals exercised Escobar's 2017 option. The Royals 
will pay Escobar $21.75 million in 2017. Escobar started playing baseball 
when he was barely four years old, and said he idolized fellow Venezuelan 
Omar Vizquel.[1] Also, Escobar's first cousin, Kelvim Escobar, was an MLB
