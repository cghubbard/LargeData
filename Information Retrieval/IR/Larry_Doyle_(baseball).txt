Lawrence Joseph Doyle (July 31, 1886 – March 1, 1974), nicknamed "Laughing 
Larry", was an American second baseman in Major League Baseball from 1907 
to 1920 who played almost his entire career for the New York Giants. The 
National League's outstanding second baseman during the 1910s, he was awarded 
the 1912 Chalmers Award as the league's best player, and won the 1915 batting 
title with a .320 average. The team captain and top everyday star on three 
consecutive pennant winners (1911–13), his .408 career slugging average 
was the top mark by an NL second baseman when he retired, as were his career 
totals in hits (1887), doubles (299), triples (123), total bases (2654) 
and extra base hits (496). He ended his career among the major league leaders 
in career games (5th, 1730), putouts (9th, 3635), assists (9th, 4654), 
total chances (9th, 8732) and double plays (5th, 694) at second base, and 
set Giants franchise records for career games, at bats and doubles, each 
of which was broken by Bill Terry. Born in Caseyville, Illinois, Doyle 
was a third baseman in the minor leagues before his contract was purchased 
by the Giants for a then-record $4,500. He debuted with the Giants on July 
22, 1907, arriving late after taking the wrong boat across the Hudson River; 
he cost his team the game with a ninth-inning error, though he also had 
a pair of hits. Doyle moved to Breese, Illinois, where his family owned 
a motel next to the current city hall.[citation needed] He expected to 
be returned to the minor leagues; instead, he was retained by manager John 
McGraw, who named him the team's field captain in 1908 – a year in which 
he finished third in the batting race with a .308 average. Doyle, who also 
became the roommate of Christy Mathewson for several years, followed up 
with a 1909 season in which he led the NL in hits (172) and was among the 
league's top four players in batting (.302), slugging (.419), home runs 
(6) and total bases (239). 1910 saw a slight dropoff, though he was still 
third in the NL in home runs (8) and fourth in runs scored (97). He then 
entered the strongest part of his career; in 1911 he finished third in 
the voting for the initial Chalmers Award after hitting .310 and finishing 
second in the league with a .527 slugging average – the highest by an NL 
second baseman since Ross Barnes slugged .590 in the league's inaugural 
1876 campaign. Doyle also led the league with 25 triples, the most by an 
NL player since 1899; it remains the highest total by a Giant since 1900. 
He stole 30 bases for the third consecutive year, and finished fourth in 
the league in home runs (13) and fifth in runs (102). In the 1911 World 
Series against the Philadelphia Athletics, he batted .304; with the Giants 
facing elimination in Game 5, he went 4 for 5, doubling and scoring an 
intensely disputed run in the 10th inning for a 4–3 victory. He again doubled 
and scored for a 1–0 lead in the first inning of Game 6, but the Giants 
lost the game 13–2, and with it the Series. Doyle then had a 1912 season 
which was perhaps even better, winning the Chalmers Award after hitting 
a career-high .330 as the Giants repeated as NL champions. In the 1912 
World Series against the Boston Red Sox he only hit .242, though he scored 
the first run in a Game 6 victory and was 3 for 4 with a home run in an 
11–4 rout in Game 7. But he was 0 for 5 in Game 8 as the Red Sox won 3–2 
in ten innings, after New York took a 2–1 lead in the top of the 10th, 
to capture the title. In 1913 the Giants won their third straight pennant; 
although he batted only .280, he stole 30 bases for the fifth year in a 
row and was eighth in the NL with 73 runs batted in. That year, he became 
the first player to hit a home run out of the Polo Grounds. He had an even 
more dismal 1913 World Series, hitting only .150 against the Athletics 
as the Giants lost in five games, though he did drive in the first run 
of the Series. In 1914 he slipped to a .260 average, but was fourth in 
the league in runs. On July 17, he hit a home run in the top of the 21st 
inning to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates 3–1. He enjoyed renewed success 
in 1915, however, winning the batting crown with a .320 average; it was 
the first title won by an NL second baseman since Barnes in 1876. He also 
led the league in hits (189) for the second time, and in doubles with 40 
– a Giants franchise record until George Kelly hit 42 in 1921. Doyle was 
also second in the NL in runs (86) and fifth in slugging (.442). He began 
1916 with a .278 average before being traded to the Chicago Cubs in late 
August, a painful move for the fiercely loyal player who had famously said 
in 1911 that it was "great to be young and a Giant." After hitting .395 
for the Cubs in nine games that year, he batted .254 for the team in 1917, 
finishing fourth in the league with 6 home runs, before a pair of January 
1918 trades brought him back to New York. He hit .261 in his return to 
the Giants before having his last outstanding season in 1919; that year 
he again was league runnerup in slugging with a .433 average, and was fifth 
in home runs (7). He batted .285 in his final season in 1920, and was granted 
his release so he could manage the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International 
League. At the time, he was within five games of Johnny Evers' league record 
for career games at second base. Doyle ended his career with a .290 batting 
average, putting him behind only Nap Lajoie (.338), Eddie Collins (then 
at .329) and Cupid Childs (.306) among players with 1000 games at second 
base. His 74 home runs placed him third at his position behind Fred Pfeffer 
(94) and Lajoie (83). He also had 960 runs and 793 RBI in 1766 games, as 
well as 300 stolen bases including 17 steals of home plate; he held the 
Giants club record for career steals from 1918 to 1919, when teammate George 
Burns passed him. Baseball Magazine selected Doyle as the second baseman 
on their NL All-America Team in 1911 and 1915. Doyle contracted tuberculosis 
in 1942, and entered the Trudeau Sanitorium in Saranac Lake, New York. 
When the institution closed in 1954 due to the development of an effective 
antibiotic treatment, he was the last resident to leave; Life Magazine 
photographers covered his last meal and his departure, on foot, from the 
grounds.[1] He stayed on in Saranac Lake, and died there twenty years later,
