Although the 1995 Minnesota Twins were separated from a world championship 
by only four years, it seemed like eons. Because of the 1994â€“95 Major League 
Baseball strike, the season got off to a late start. However, it did not 
end soon enough, as the team finished with a 56-88 record and in last place 
in its division. The team found it impossible to compete against the runaway 
Cleveland Indians who won 100 games despite the short season and finished 
44 games ahead of the Twins. By July, the team was trading away its veterans 
in a fire sale. Manager Tom Kelly might have preferred that the strike 
had continued. Only three players had particularly solid years: second 
baseman Chuck Knoblauch and outfielders Kirby Puckett and Marty Cordova. 
Puckett did not know that this would be his last year, but it was a solid 
one. He would be the team's lone all-star representative. Knoblauch won 
his first Silver Slugger Award. Cordova had a great year for a rookie, 
and won the Rookie of the Year award. The starting rotation was uncertain. 
Surprisingly, the only certainty was that rookie Brad Radke would get the 
ball every fifth game. He made 28 starts, but the other pitchers were either 
injury-prone, inconsistent, or traded by the end of the year, with Kevin 
Tapani making 20 starts, Mike Trombley 18, Frank Rodriguez 16, Scott Erickson 
15, and Jose Parra 12. Closer Rick Aguilera would also be traded midway 
through the season. He earned 12 saves while Dave Stevens earned 10. Aguilera, 
Rich Robertson, and Mark Guthrie were the only regular pitchers with ERAs 
under 5. Like most of Tom Kelly's teams, the defense was capable. Matt 
Walbeck was the starting catcher, backed up by Matt Merullo. Scott Stahoviak 
played in 69 games at first base. Although he was not a good hitter, he 
had a .998 fielding percentage that year. Knoblauch capably manned second 
base. Scott Leius played reasonably well at third in his last year with 
the Twins. Pat Meares continued his decent play at shortstop in his third 
year with the Twins. The regular outfielders were Puckett, Cordova, and 
Rich Becker. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]
