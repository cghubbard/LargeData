Jonathan Roy Broxton[1] (born June 16, 1984) is an American professional 
baseball relief pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He previously played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kansas City Royals, 
Cincinnati Reds, and Milwaukee Brewers. Broxton attended Burke County High 
School in Waynesboro, Georgia. As a senior for the Bears, he posted a 9–2 
record and a 1.21 earned run average as a pitcher. He was drafted by the 
Los Angeles Dodgers in the second round in 2002 and signed with them on 
June 30, 2002. In the minor leagues, from 2002 to 2006, Broxton was 23–11 
with 12 saves and a 3.03 ERA in 303 innings. He struck out 332 batters, 
while walking 115 and giving up 244 hits. His minor league teams were the 
Great Falls Dodgers of the Pioneer League, the South Georgia Waves of the 
South Atlantic League, the Vero Beach Dodgers of the Florida State League, 
and the "AA" Jacksonville Suns of the Southern League. Broxton made his 
big league debut on July 29, 2005 against the St. Louis Cardinals, pitching 
one inning in relief, allowing one run, and striking out two. His first 
strikeout victim was Cardinals Albert Pujols. During the 2005 campaign, 
he appeared in 14 games, all in relief, striking out 22 batters in only 
13 and two-third innings. Broxton began the 2006 season with the Dodgers 
Triple-A affiliate, the Las Vegas 51s. After allowing no runs in 11 appearances 
(with 18 strikeouts), on May 1, 2006, Broxton was recalled from the minors 
after the demotion of veteran Lance Carter.[2] After gradually gaining 
the confidence of manager Grady Little, Broxton became Takashi Saito's 
primary setup man, and the team's backup closer. He held batters to a .159 
Batting average with runners in scoring position, and held right-handed 
batters to a .196 batting average. He appeared in a career high 83 games 
for the Dodgers, third most in the National League and fourth most in franchise 
history. He threw 99 strikeouts (second most among all big league relievers) 
and ranked fifth in the Majors with 32 holds. His 2.85 ERA placed him as 
one of nine Major League pitchers with more than 75 innings pitched and 
an era below 3.78. Broxton recorded 96 2⁄3 consecutive no-home run innings 
from July 23, 2006 to August 21, 2007. That was the longest streak in team 
history since the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958.[3] On July 19, 
2008, Saito was placed on the disabled list (DL), and Broxton inherited 
the closer role for the remainder of the season. He allowed a pinch hit 
two run homer to Matt Stairs of the Philadelphia Phillies in the 8th inning 
of Game 4 of the 2008 NLCS.[4] In his first season as the full-time closer 
for the Dodgers, Broxton was selected to the National League All-Star team. 
However, he was unable to play in the Game due to injury. His final regular 
season record was 7–2 with a 2.61 ERA, 36 saves and 114 strikeouts. Despite 
his accomplished season, he suffered a costly blown save in Game 4 of the 
2009 National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies 
when he walked Matt Stairs, hit Carlos Ruiz with a pitch and then allowed 
a two out/two run walk off hit by Jimmy Rollins. Broxton had an excellent 
first half of the season and was selected to the 2010 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game, in which he recorded the save. However, he faded in the 
second half, beginning with a blown save against the New York Yankees in 
which he threw 48 pitches and allowed 4 runs on 4 hits and 2 walks. In 
somewhat of a repeat performance against the Phillies, he blew another 
4-run lead on August 12, as this time it was Carlos Ruiz delivering the 
2-run walk-off hit.[5] He was replaced as the closer at the end of the 
season by Hong-Chih Kuo. He was nicknamed by fans the "Fat Hobo." Broxton 
returned to the closer role at the start of the 2011 season and appeared 
in 14 games in March and April, with a 5.68 ERA and 7 saves. On May 4, 
he admitted that he had been feeling some pain in his elbow and he was 
placed on the disabled list.[6] After a couple of months off he made two 
rehab appearances with the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes on June 21 and 23 but 
felt tightness in his shoulder when throwing on June 25 and was shut down 
again.[7] He had hoped to return in September but Manager Don Mattingly 
said that it would be late if he returned, if at all.[8] He had another 
setback after testing his elbow off a mound in September and was shut down 
for the season.[9] He became a free agent at the conclusion of the season. 
On November 29, 2011, Broxton signed a one-year, $4 million contract with 
the Kansas City Royals.[10] On April 11, 2012, Broxton tied a dubious record 
for a major-league pitcher by ending and losing a game on consecutive hits 
by pitch (HBP).[11] The last time this happened was on September 2, 1966, 
when Stu Miller of the Baltimore Orioles hit Al Weis and Tommie Agee of 
the Chicago White Sox.[12] Overall, Broxton had a strong first half, posting 
a 2.05 ERA, with 20 saves in 23 save opportunities through July 1. On the 
July 31, 2012 MLB non-waiver Trade Deadline Broxton was dealt to the Cincinnati 
Reds in exchange for minor league pitchers J. C. Sulbaran and Donnie Joseph.[13] 
On November 28, 2012, Broxton agreed to terms on a multi-year extension 
with the Reds. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 15, 2013 
due to a right elbow flexor strain. He was placed on the DL again in August. 
After closer Aroldis Chapman was hit in the head with a line drive on March 
19, Broxton took over the closer duties for the Reds to start the 2014 
season. On August 31, 2014, Broxton was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers 
for two players to be named later.[14] On September 10, the Brewers agreed 
to send Kevin Shackelford and Barrett Astin to the Reds to complete the 
trade.[15] On July 31, 2015, Broxton was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals 
in exchange for minor league outfielder Malik Collymore.[16] The Brewers 
also sent cash, as the pitcher's 2015 salary was $9 million ($9,011,386.0 
today), and he would have been arbitration eligible in 2016 with a $2 million 
($2,002,530.2 today) buyout.[17] Broxton made his Cardinals debut on August 
1 in a 6–2 loss to the Colorado Rockies, pitching one scoreless inning, 
and allowing no runners to reach base.[18] He completed 24 innings, striking 
out 26 with 12 walks and a 2.66 ERA. The Cardinals declined the $9 million 
option after the season, buying it out for $2 million and making him a 
free agent.[19] On December 10, 2015, the Cardinals re-signed Broxton to 
a two-year contract worth $7.5 million.[20] He started the season with 
a 2.25 ERA through May 19, but after allowing five earned runs while recording 
one out against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 20, his ERA jumped to 4.96. 
As a result, infielder Rubén Tejada made his major league pitching debut 
in the ninth inning of that game.[21] Broxton was a member of the United 
States team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic during March 2009. The 6 ft 
4 in (1.93 m), 305 lb (138 kg) Broxton features a mid-90s fastball as well 
as a slider.[22] His fastball velocity is down from his early years – it 
topped out at 102 mph in 2009 MLB season.[23] Broxton and his wife, Elizabeth, 
married in January 2006.[24][25] The couple had their first child, a son
