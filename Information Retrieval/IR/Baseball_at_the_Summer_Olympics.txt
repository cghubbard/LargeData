Baseball at the Summer Olympics unofficially debuted at the 1904 Summer 
Games, and became an official Olympic sport at the 1992 Summer Olympics. 
The event was last played in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing with South Korea 
taking the gold. In 2016 it was confirmed that Baseball would return for 
the 2020 games in Tokyo. Olympic baseball is governed by the International 
Baseball Federation (IBAF). Although little was recorded, Olympic baseball 
first appeared in 1904 St. Louis. Eight years later in 1912 Stockholm, 
a United States team played against host Sweden, winning 13-3. Baseball 
was also played at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, the American team 
beating the French team (the local Ranelagh Club) 5-0 in a four inning 
exhibition game. In 1936 Berlin, two United States teams played each other 
before approximately 90,000 - 100,000 spectators at the Reichsportsfeld.[citation

baseball, played by two Finnish teams. Australia played a one-game exhibition 
against the United States in 1956 Melbourne and Japan did the same in 1964 
Tokyo. With a crowd of nearly 114,000 spectators, this game at the Melbourne 
Cricket Ground held the record for the highest attended baseball game ever 
until a 2008 American exhibition game in Los Angeles. After a twenty-year 
hiatus, Olympic baseball (labelled an exhibition sport/event by the IOC) 
returned but with tournament formatting (1984 Los Angeles). In 1988 Seoul, 
it was termed a demonstration sport. Japan defeated the United States in 
the inaugural tournament finale in 1984. However, in 1988, the United States 
won over Japan. Baseball became an official sport at the 1992 Summer Olympics, 
with the familiar eight team tournament. Players were required to be amateurs. 
The tournament consisted of a round-robin, in which teams played each of 
the other teams, followed by semifinals and finals. The format of the competition 
remained the same after that, with the only major change being that starting 
in 2000 players were not required to be amateurs. At the IOC meeting on 
July 7, 2005, baseball and softball were voted out of the 2012 Summer Olympics 
in London, United Kingdom, becoming the first sports voted out of the Olympics 
since polo was eliminated from the 1936 Olympics.[1] The elimination excised 
16 teams and more than 300 athletes from the 2012 Olympics. The two slots 
left available by the IOC's elimination were subsequently filled by golf 
and rugby sevens in 2016. This decision was reaffirmed on February 9, 2006.[2] 
In the stands during the 2008 bronze medal game between the U.S. and Japan, 
IOC head Jacques Rogge was interviewed by MLB.com's Mark Newman and cited 
various criteria for Baseball to earn its way back in: "To be on the Olympic 
program is an issue where you need universality as much as possible. You 
need to have a sport with a following, you need to have the best players 
and you need to be in strict compliance with WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency). 
And these are the qualifications that have to be met. When you have all 
that, you have to win hearts. You can win the mind, but you still must 
win hearts."[3] It was officially decided in August 2009 at the IOC Board 
meeting in Berlin that baseball would also not be included in the 2016 
Summer Olympics.[4] On April 1, 2011, the IBAF and the International Softball 
Federation announced they were preparing a joint proposal to revive play 
of both sports at the 2020 Summer Olympics.[5] In August 2011, Olympic 
news source Around the Rings reported that the ISF and IBAF would not rush 
into an Olympic proposal, and that the IBAF was working on forming a temporary 
commission to analyze the prospect of a joint proposal. "In the past, baseball 
and softball were running alone, and the result was that baseball and softball 
stayed out," IBAF president Riccardo Fraccari said in reference to their 
decades-long push for Olympic inclusion. On September 8, 2013, the International 
Olympic Committee voted to reinstate wrestling, defeating the combined 
baseball-softball bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics.[6] On December 8, 2014, 
in Monaco, the International Olympic Committee signed off on changes that 
would allow the 2020 Summer Olympics organizers to resurrect baseball and 
softball.[7] On September 28, 2015, the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee 
announced that it would be recommending the reintroduction of baseball/softball, 
along with four other sports, to the IOC.[8] On August 3, 2016, the International 
Olympic Committee approved the return of baseball and softball to the Olympic 
program for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.[9] The host nation was always 
guaranteed a place in the Olympic baseball tournament. The other seven 
places were generally determined by continental qualifying tournaments. 
For the 2008 Games, the Americas received two places, Europe received one 
place, and Asia received one place. The final three places were given to 
the top three nations at an eight-team tournament held after the continental 
tournaments. Qualification for this tournament was determined by those 
continental tournaments. The third and fourth place American teams, second 
and third place European teams, second and third place Asian teams, first 
place African team, and first place Oceania team competed in that tournament. 
This qualification tournament was new for 2008. It was created after heavy 
criticism of the previous qualification standard. In previous Olympics, 
only two teams from the Americas were able to qualify for the Olympics, 
despite the fact that the vast majority of the top baseball-playing nations 
in the world came from this region. Europe, whose baseball nations were 
substantially weaker, also entered two teams. Olympic baseball was nearly 
identical to most professional baseball. Aluminum bats were disallowed 
after 1996 Atlanta. There was also a mercy rule that was invoked if a team 
was winning by 10 or more runs after 7 innings (or 6.5 innings if the home 
team was leading). For Sydney 2000, rosters were expanded to 24 players. 
The tournament consisted of a round-robin preliminary round in which each 
team played all 7 of the other teams. Only the top four teams advanced 
to the medals round. In that round, semifinals were played between the 
1st/4th place teams and the 2nd/3rd place teams. The semifinal losers then 
played a bronze medal game, with the winner earning the medal and the loser 
receiving 4th place. The semifinal winners played in the final, which awarded 
the winner a gold medal and the loser a silver medal. During the 2008 games 
a unique rule went into effect during games which went into extra innings.[10] 
If the game was still tied after the completion of the tenth inning base 
runners were automatically placed on first and second base with no outs.[10] 
IBAF created this rule to encourage scoring late in the game in order to 
determine a winner and to address criticisms from the IOC that a baseball 
game's length was unpredictable.[10] The following 16 nations took part 
in the baseball competition. The numbers in the table refer to the final
