The 1976 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 94th season in the history 
of the franchise. The Phillies won their first National League East title, 
as they compiled a record of 101-61, nine games ahead of the second-place 
Pittsburgh Pirates, and won 100 games or more for the first season in franchise 
history. The Phillies lost the NLCS, 3-0 to the Cincinnati Reds. Danny 
Ozark managed the Phillies, as they played their home games at Veterans 
Stadium, where the All-Star Game was played that season. The final 9-game 
margin masks how competitive the season actually was. In a scary echo of 
1964, the Phillies saw a 15 1⁄2-game August lead dwindle to just 3 games 
as their offense dried up on two late-year road trips. Mike Schmidt hit 
12 home runs in Philadelphia's first 15 games, including 4 in one game 
on April 17.[5] No one had hit this many home runs so quickly. In that 
game, the Phillies and Chicago Cubs combined for thirty-four runs in a 
game which featured nine home runs.[6] Schmidt's home run feat was later 
tied by Alex Rodriguez in 2007. Schmidt also won his first of 10 Gold Gloves 
that year, and carried the Phillies to the 1976 NLCS where he hit .308.
