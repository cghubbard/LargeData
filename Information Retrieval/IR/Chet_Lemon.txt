Chester Earl Lemon (born February 12, 1955) is a former Major League Baseball 
outfielder. A three-time All-Star, he was a member of the World Series 
champion 1984 Detroit Tigers. Lemon was drafted in the first round (22nd 
overall) of the 1972 Major League Baseball draft by the Oakland Athletics 
out of John C. Fremont High School in Los Angeles. Midway through his fourth 
season in Oakland's farm system, Lemon was dealt to the Chicago White Sox 
with Dave Hamilton for Stan Bahnsen and Skip Pitlock. He batted .307 with 
eight home runs and 49 runs batted in for the triple A Denver Bears to 
earn a call up to the White Sox that September. An infielder in the minor 
leagues, Lemon played third base during his brief stint with the Chicago 
White Sox in 1975. He entered Spring training 1976 as the leading candidate 
for the third base job, but after failing to impress manager Paul Richards 
with his glove, was moved to the outfield.[1] He made the transition seamlessly, 
as he made only three errors all season while logging a .992 fielding percentage 
in centerfield. He batted .246 with four home runs, 38 RBIs and 46 runs 
scored to earn Topps All-Star Rookie Teams honors. He came into his own 
as both a hitter and centerfielder in 1977. He scored a career high 99 
runs, while showing a dramatic increase in power, hitting fifteen more 
home runs than he had his rookie season. He also set an American League 
record with 524 total chances and 512 putouts in the outfield, a record 
that still stands.[2] With the White Sox in sixth place in the American 
League West, ahead only of the expansion Seattle Mariners, Lemon was selected 
as his team's lone representative at the 1978 All-Star Game. Though he 
did not receive an at-bat, he entered the game in left field in the eighth 
inning, and committed an error in the National League's four run eighth.[3] 
The White Sox finished the season in fifth, eventually passing the Oakland 
A's in the standings. Lemon went 2-for-5 on the second to last day of the 
season to bring his season batting average to .300.[4] He sat out his team's 
final game. In 1979, Lemon was again the sole White Sox player on the American 
League All-Star team. He entered the game in the second inning, and scored 
in the third after being hit by a Joaquín Andújar pitch.[5] He ended the 
season with a .318 batting average and 86 RBIs, both career highs. He also 
hit 44 doubles, tying the Milwaukee Brewers' Cecil Cooper for the American 
League season best total. The White Sox finished near the bottom of the 
division standings during most of Lemon's tenure with the club. With the 
addition of free agent catcher Carlton Fisk and designated hitter Greg 
Luzinski, the team improved to 31-22 and finished in third in the first 
half of the strike shortened 1981 season. For his part, Lemon batted .299 
with three home runs and 22 RBIs in the first half. Though his team finished 
in sixth place in the second half, Lemon's stats improved, as he batted 
.305 with six home runs and drove in 28. Following the season, Lemon was 
traded to the Detroit Tigers for outfielder Steve Kemp.[6] Lemon joined 
a Tiger team with a talented, young nucleus of Alan Trammell, Lou Whitaker, 
Jack Morris, Kirk Gibson and Lance Parrish. The team got off to a 35–5 
start in 1984, and went on to take the American League East by fifteen 
games over the Toronto Blue Jays. Lemon arguably had his best season in 
1984, as he hit .287 with 20 home runs and 76 RBIs, and collected a .990 
fielding percentage while handling 421 total chances. He was also the starting 
center fielder for the American League at the 1984 All-Star game.[7] Reaching 
the post-season for the first time in his career, Lemon went hitless in 
thirteen at-bats in the Tigers' three game sweep of the Kansas City Royals 
in the 1984 American League Championship Series.[8] He improved in the 
World Series, batting .294 with a run scored and a run batted in.[9] In 
1988, Lemon moved from center field to right field to make room for speedy 
new acquisition Gary Pettis. On September 20, he hit his 200th career home 
run off the Cleveland Indians's Scott Bailes. In the same game, Darrell 
Evans hit his 400th career home run.[10] Following the 1990 season, he 
became ill with a serious spleen disease, polycythemia. He attempted a 
comeback with the Tigers in 1991, but was unsuccessful, and retired.[11] 
In December 2001, Lemon successfully underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic 
to have his spleen removed.[12] Lemon recorded 400 or more outfield putouts 
in five different seasons, an American League record. He also had a unique 
ability to be hit by a pitch; in the 1980s, he was second only to Don Baylor 
by getting plunked 108 times. He also had a penchant for diving headfirst 
into first base. He now coaches two successful AAU teams, Chet Lemon's 
Juice, (18 and under) and Chet Lemon's Juice II, (14 and under) in Eustis, 
Florida. Lemon was also the head coach for Eustis High School in Eustis, 
Florida. where he led the Panthers to the 2003 State Championship. The 
Texas Rangers drafted Chet's son, Marcus Lemon, in the fourth round of 
the 2006 draft. On April 1, 2011, Marcus was traded to the Atlanta Braves 
for a minor leaguer.[13] On February 29, 2012 Marcus signed a minor league
