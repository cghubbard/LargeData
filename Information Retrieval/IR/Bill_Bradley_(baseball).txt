As player As manager William Joseph Bradley (February 13, 1878 â€“ March 
11, 1954) was a third baseman and manager in Major League Baseball. He 
recognized as one of the best third basemen in baseball prior to 1950, 
along with Jimmy Collins and Pie Traynor. He led American League third 
basemen in fielding four times, setting a league record of seven putouts 
in one game in both 1901 and 1909.[1] Bill Bradley was the first Cleveland 
baseball player to hit for the cycle on September 24, 1903. In 1902 he 
hit home runs in four straight games and finished the year with a .340 
batting average.[1] Bradley made his professional debut on August 26, 1899 
with the Chicago Orphans. After playing for two seasons in Chicago, Bradley 
moved to Cleveland to play for the newly formed American League. He spent 
the next decade with the Cleveland franchise, his best season coming in 
1902 when he had a batting average of .340, 12 triples, and 11 home runs. 
After the 1910 season, Bradley spent three seasons with the Toronto Maple 
Leafs of the International League before returning to the Federal League 
in 1914, playing for the Brooklyn Tip-Tops that year and the Kansas City 
Packers the following year. After finishing his playing and managing career 
in the Federal League, Bill Bradley was a scout for the Cleveland Indians. 
He was elected to the Indians' Hall of Fame shortly after his death in 
1954.[1] Bradley died in Cleveland at the age of 77 due to pneumonia.[2]
