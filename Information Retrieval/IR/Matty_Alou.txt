Mateo "Matty" Rojas Alou (December 22, 1938 – November 3, 2011)[1] was 
a Dominican outfielder who spent fifteen seasons in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) with the San Francisco Giants (1960–1965), Pittsburgh Pirates (1966–1970), 
St. Louis Cardinals (1971–1972, 1973), Oakland Athletics (1972), New York 
Yankees (1973) and San Diego Padres (1974). He also played in Nippon Professional 
Baseball (NPB) with the Taiheiyo Club Lions from 1974 through 1976.[2] 
He was the middle of a trio of baseball-playing brothers that included 
the older Felipe and Jesús.[3] They were the first set of three siblings 
to play together in the same outfield (on September 15).[4] and all bat 
in the same half-inning in the majors (September 10),[5] accomplishing 
both with the Giants in 1963. Matty had been teammates with Felipe during 
the prior three campaigns, and was likewise with Jesús for the following 
two. Matty and Felipe later reunited with the Yankees in 1973.[6] Alou's 
best years as a player were spent with the Pirates, where he won the National 
League (NL) batting title in 1966 and was a two-time All-Star in 1968 and 
1969. He was a member of a World Series Champion with the Athletics in 
1972 and a NL pennant winner with the Giants in 1962. Alou was born in 
Haina, Dominican Republic. He was a platoon player for the Giants for several 
years and was mostly unremarkable. His finest moment in San Francisco came 
in 1962 when his pinch-hit bunt single in the final game of a three-game 
tie-breaking playoff against the Los Angeles Dodgers began the rally that 
won the game and the pennant for the Giants. He batted .333 in the Giants' 
losing effort against the Yankees in that year's World Series. While he 
was primarily an outfielder, Alou also appeared in one game in 1965 as 
a pitcher, pitching two scoreless innings.[7] After Alou was traded to 
the Pirates before the 1966 season, he received instruction from expert 
hitting instructor Harry "the Hat" Walker that helped turn him into a formidable 
hitter. He won the batting title with a .342 average, with his brother 
Felipe finishing second, and finished in the top five in hitting four more 
times after that 1967–1969, 1971. He also led the league in at bats twice 
(1969-1970), hits once (1969) and doubles once (1969). After leaving the 
Major Leagues following the 1974 season, he played three seasons in Japan 
(Taiheiyo Club Lions) and managed in the Dominican Winter League. On June 
23, 2007, the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame inducted Matty 
Alou into their Hall of Fame during an on-field, pre-game ceremony at AT&T 
Park before a game between the San Francisco Giants and the New York Yankees. 
He, along with San Francisco Giants shortstop Omar Vizquel were inducted 
in front of over 43,000 fans. Alou died in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic 
of diabetes complications, according to his former Dominican team, Leones 
del Escogido. The Giants also confirmed his death and said Alou had been
