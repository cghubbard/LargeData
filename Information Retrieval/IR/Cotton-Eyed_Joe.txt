"Cotton-Eyed Joe" (also known as "Cotton-Eye Joe") is a traditional American 
country folk song popular at various times throughout the United States 
and Canada, although today it is most commonly associated with the American 
South. In the Roud index of folksongs it is No. 942. "Cotton-Eyed Joe" 
has inspired both a partner dance and more than one line dance that is 
often danced at country dance venues in the U.S. and around the world. 
The 1980 film Urban Cowboy sparked a renewed interest in the dance. In 
1985, The Moody Brothers' version of the song received a Grammy Award nomination 
for "Best Country Instrumental Performance". Irish group The Chieftains 
received a Grammy nomination for "Best Country Vocal Collaboration" for 
their version of the song with lead vocals by Ricky Skaggs on their 1992 
album, Another Country. In 1994, a version of the song recorded by the 
Swedish band Rednex as "Cotton Eye Joe" became popular worldwide. The origins 
of this song are unclear, although it pre-dates the 1861–1865 American 
Civil War.[1] American folklorist Dorothy Scarborough (1878–1935) noted 
in her 1925 book On the Trail of Negro Folk-songs, that several people 
remember hearing the song before the war. Scarborough's account of the 
song came from her sister, Mrs. George Scarborough, who learned the song 
from "the Negroes on a plantation in Texas, and other parts from a man 
in Louisiana." The man in Louisiana knew the song from his earliest childhood 
and heard slaves singing it on plantations.[2] Both the dance and the song 
had as many variants as the old old folk song that it is.[3] American publishing 
house Harper and Brothers published a version in 1882, heard by author 
Louise Clarke Pyrnelle (born 1850) on the Alabama plantation of her father 
when she was a child,[4] that was later republished in 1910:[5] "Cotton-eyed 
Joe, Cotton-eyed Joe, What did make you sarve me so, Fur ter take my gal 
erway fum me, An' cyar her plum ter Tennessee? Ef it hadn't ben fur Cotton-eyed 
Joe, I'd er been married long ergo. "His eyes wuz crossed, an' his nose 
wuz flat, An' his teef wuz out, but wat uv dat? Fur he wuz tall, an' he 
wuz slim, An' so my gal she follered him. Ef it hadn't ben fur Cotton-eyed 
Joe, I'd er been married long ergo. "No gal so hansum could be foun', Not 
in all dis country roun', Wid her kinky head, an' her eyes so bright, Wid 
her lips so red an' her teef so white. Ef it hadn't ben fur Cotton-eyed 
Joe, I'd been married long ergo. "An' I loved dat gal wid all my heart, 
An' she swo' fum me she'd never part; But den wid Joe she runned away, 
An' lef' me hyear fur ter weep all day. O Cotton-eyed Joe, O Cotton-eyed 
Joe, What did make you sarve me so? O Joe, ef it hadn't er ben fur you, 
I'd er married dat gal fur true." By 1884, the same year Mark Twain's Adventures 
of Huckleberry Finn was published, the fiddle-based song was referred to 
as "an old, familiar air."[6] In 1925, another version was recorded by 
folklorist Dorothy Scarborough and published.[7] Don't you remember, don't 
you know, Don't you remember Cotton-eyed Joe? Cotton-eyed Joe, Cotton-eyed 
Joe, What did make you treat me so? I'd 'a' been married forty year ago 
Ef it had n't a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe! Cotton-eyed Joe, Cotton-eyed 
Joe, He was de nig dat sarved me so, ? Tuck my gal away fum me, Carried 
her off to Tennessee. I'd 'a' been married forty year ago If it had n't 
a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe. Hi's teeth was out an' his nose was flat, His 
eyes was crossed, ? but she did n't mind dat. Kase he was tall, and berry 
slim, An' so my gal she follered him. I'd 'a' been married forty year ago 
Ef it had n't a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe. She was de prettiest gal to be 
found Anywhar in de country round; Her lips was red an' her eyes was bright, 
Her skin was black but her teeth was white. I'd 'a' been married forty 
year ago Ef it had n't a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe. Dat gal, she sho' had 
all my love, An swore fum ne she'd never move, But Joe hoodooed her, don't 
you see, An' she run off wid him to Tennessee, I'd 'a' been married forty 
years ago, Ef it hadn't a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe." Scarborough noted 
that the song seemed to be well known in the South prior to the Civil War, 
and parts of it had been sent in by various persons.[7] Over the years, 
many different versions of the song have been performed and/or recorded 
with many different versions of the lyrics (and many without lyrics). "Cotton-Eyed 
Joe", on occasion referred to as "The South Texas National Anthem", was 
played for minstrel-type jigs, and it has long been popular as a square 
dance hoedown and a couple dance polka.[8] A resident of Central Texas 
who learned the dance in Williamson County in the early 1880s described 
it as nothing but a heel and toe "poker" with fringes added. These fringes 
added to the heel and toe polka were clog steps which required skill and 
extroversion on the part of the dancer.[9] During the first half of the 
twentieth century the song was a widely known folk song all over English-speaking 
North America. One discography lists 134 recorded versions released since 
1950.[10] In more recent decades, the song has waned in popularity in most 
regions except some parts of the American South where it is still a popular 
folk song.[11] A list of the possible meanings of the term "cotton-eyed" 
that have been proposed includes: to be drunk on moonshine, or to have 
been blinded by drinking wood alcohol, turning the eyes milky white; a 
black person with very light blue eyes; someone whose eyes were milky white 
from bacterial infections of Trachoma or syphilis, cataracts or glaucoma; 
the contrast of dark skin tone around white eyeballs in black people;[12] 
and possibly pterygium, a reddish-white corneal overgrowth associated with 
chronic sun exposure.[citation needed] Bob Wills and Adolph Hofner and 
His San Antonians both recorded the song, and Hofner's version (Columbia 
37658), issued in 1941,[13] apparently[clarification needed] being the 
one that did the most to popularize the song.[14] A 1967 instrumental version 
of the song (KIKR k202) by Al Dean, who recalled the song called "The Gingerbread 
Man" in South Texas, inspired a new round dance polka for couples. This 
dance was adapted into a simplified version as a nonpartner waist-hold, 
spoke line routine. Heel and toe polka steps were replaced with a cross-lift 
followed by a kick with two-steps. The lift and kick are sometimes accompanied 
by shouts of "whoops, whoops," or the barn yard term "bull shit", mimicking 
the act of kicking off barnyard muck.[8] The practice continues to this 
day. The Kickin′ album included "Cotton-Eyed Joe" by Dean. (KIK-R: 10012) 
One version of a dance called "Cotton-Eyed Joe" can be found in the 1975 
edition of Encyclopedia of Social Dance. This version has the men on the 
inside of a circle facing out, and the women on the outside facing in. 
The dance consists of eight kick steps, side, close left together, right 
together, and a series of struts.[15] The spoke line version gained popularity 
not only in Texas, but across the US and overseas[clarification needed] 
in the 1980s.[8] Ray Benson of the Western Swing band Asleep at the Wheel 
talks about playing the Bob Wills version of "Cotton-Eyed Joe" in Texas 
in the 1970s when the dance was very much alive.[16] A Western "Craze" 
followed the 1980 release of Urban Cowboy. "Cotton-Eyed Joe", and its continued 
popularity in Texas, was referred to in the lyrics to Alabama's song "If 
You're Gonna Play in Texas." "I remember down in Houston we were puttin' 
on a show when a cowboy in the back stood up and yelled, "Cotton-Eyed Joe"!" 
In Merle Haggard's "Texas Fiddle Song", the final verse makes reference 
to the "Cotton-Eyed Joe" and features the melody of both the Bob Wills 
and Al Dean versions. The song has become a staple song played at many 
professional and college baseball games during the seventh-inning stretch 
with the preference going to the Rednex version. In August 1994, Swedish 
recording group Rednex covered the song as "Cotton Eye Joe" for their album 
Sex & Violins, combining their style with traditional American instruments, 
such as banjos,[21] and fiddles. In 2002, "Cotton Eye Joe" was remixed 
in a dance version, and was released from Rednex's greatest hits album, 
The Best of the West. The Rednex version of the song (using "Eye" instead 
of "Eyed"), along with a dance-mix version, was very successful in Europe, 
where it remained at number one in Norway for 15 weeks, Switzerland for 
13 weeks, Germany for 10 weeks, Sweden for 8 weeks, Austria for 7 weeks, 
and for 3 weeks on the UK Singles Chart. In Oceania, it topped the New 
Zealand Singles Chart for 6 consecutive weeks. In Australia it peaked at 
number 8 in April 1995. In the US, it peaked at number 25 in March 1995. 
The Country and Irish singer Lee Matthews released his version of the song 
with new added lyrics. The single on his own independent label topped the
