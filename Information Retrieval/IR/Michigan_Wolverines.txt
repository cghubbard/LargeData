The Michigan Wolverines comprise 27 varsity sports teams at the University 
of Michigan. These teams compete in the NCAA's Division I and in the Big 
Ten Conference in all sports except women's water polo, which competes 
in the NCAA inter-divisional Collegiate Water Polo Association. Team colors 
are maize and blue, though these are different shades of "maize" and "blue" 
than those used by the university at large.[2] The winged helmet is a recognized 
icon of Michigan Athletics. In 11 of the past 20 years (through 2014–15), 
Michigan has finished in the top five of the NACDA Directors' Cup, a list 
compiled by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics 
that charts institutions' overall success in college sports. UM has finished 
in the top ten of the Directors' Cup standings in sixteen of the award's 
twenty-two seasons. Michigan has won 36 NCAA team titles.[3] Overall, UM's 
36 official NCAA Division I titles ranks tenth all-time behind UCLA, Stanford, 
USC, Oklahoma State, Texas, Arkansas, LSU, Penn State, and UNC. In NCAA 
D1 men's sports only, UM ranks sixth all-time in championships behind USC, 
UCLA, Stanford, Oklahoma State, and Arkansas. UM's official NCAA Division 
I national championships have come from ten different sports – this broad-based 
success matches the University of Texas for fourth place in the NCAA record 
book. Only UCLA and Stanford, each with titles in 16 varying sports, and 
USC in 15, have more diverse championship histories than the Wolverines. 
University of Michigan teams have also been national runners-up 37 times 
in 13 different sports: men's basketball (5), women's cross country (1), 
women's field hockey (1), men's golf (3), men's gymnastics (2), women's 
gymnastics (2), men's ice hockey (3), women's rowing (2), softball (1), 
men's swimming and diving (10), women's swimming and diving (1), men's 
outdoor track and field (1), and wrestling (5).[14] [15] The University 
of Michigan Athletic Department sponsors teams in 14 men's and 15 women's 
NCAA sanctioned sports:[19] Men's athletic teams Women's athletic teams 
The men's baseball team won national championships in 1953 and 1962 and 
has sent 138 players to the major leagues.[20][21] Michigan has appeared 
in the College World Series seven times. Notable alumni include George 
Sisler, Barry Larkin, Jim Abbott, Arizona Diamondbacks' pitcher J. J. Putz, 
and Kansas City Royals' second baseman Chris Getz. Another important figure 
in the history of Michigan baseball is former Brooklyn Dodgers general 
manager Branch Rickey, who was the head coach for four years in 1910–13 
and recruited Sisler to Ann Arbor.[citation needed] The current coach of 
the Michigan Wolverines is Erik Bakich, who came to the University of Michigan 
after the 2012 season when Rich Maloney stepped down. Michigan has won 
35 conference championships, made 22 NCAA Tournament appearances and won 
those 2 national titles. For 13 seasons from 1990 to 2002, Michigan won 
a lone Big Ten title in 1997 and made just one NCAA appearance in 1999. 
In 2015, Coach Bakich led the program to its first NCAA tournament berth 
since 2008 after needing to win the Big Ten Tournament to qualify. The 
men's basketball team plays its games at Crisler Center. The Wolverines 
have won 14 Big Ten regular-season conference titles, as well as the inaugural 
Big Ten Tournament in 1998, which it later forfeited due to NCAA violations. 
The team has appeared in the NCAA Final Four on seven occasions (1964, 
1965, 1976, 1989, 1992*, 1993*, 2013) and won the National Championship 
in 1989 under Steve Fisher. The program later vacated its 1992 and 1993 
Final Four appearances due to NCAA violations. Other notable players who 
played for Michigan include Roy Tarpley, Loy Vaught, Gary Grant, Terry 
Mills, Glen Rice, Jalen Rose, Rumeal Robinson, Rickey Green, Phil Hubbard, 
Jamal Crawford, Juwan Howard, Chris Webber, Jimmy King, Cazzie Russell, 
Daniel Horton, Campy Russell, and Mark Hughes. During the 1990s, the program 
became involved in a scandal involving payments from a booster named Ed 
Martin to four players: Chris Webber, Maurice Taylor, Robert Traylor, and 
Louis Bullock. The scandal ultimately resulted in four years' probation 
and a self-imposed ban from postseason play in the 2002–03 season. UM also 
voluntarily vacated regular season wins and NCAA tournament games from 
selected past seasons. Vacating the results of 113 games won while the 
four players were eligible, including the 1992 and 1993 Final Fours, the 
entire 1992–93 season, and all seasons from fall 1995 through spring 1999. 
After the scandal, Michigan men's basketball would then go 10 years without 
making the NCAA tournament from 1999–2008.[22] They would eventually end 
the drought in 2009 under current head coach John Beilein. In 2013, the 
program would reach its first Final Four in 20 years before falling to 
Louisville in the national championship, 82–76. Michigan traveled to St. 
Thomas for the Paradise Jam Tournament over Thanksgiving weekend in 2011. 
They took on Prairie View A&M in their first game on Thanksgiving Day, 
and won 59–53.[23] In their second game, they faced Washington State and 
won easily, 69–39.[24] On the final day of the tournament, they played 
Marquette, and won 71–51, to win the 2011 Paradise Jam (Reef Division) 
Championship. Jenny Ryan had a double-double, with 13 points and ten rebounds, 
to help Michigan to a 7–0 record on the year.[25][26] The women's basketball 
team is coached by Kim Barnes Arico, who became the head coach in 2012. 
Formerly the head coach of the St. John's Red Storm, Arico was named the 
Big East Conference Coach of the Year for 2012.[27] The men's and women's 
cross country teams have been nationally renowned since 1974 when Ron Warhurst 
started coaching the men, and more recently as alum Mike McGuire took on 
the women's team in 1991. The women's team has qualified for the NCAA championships 
every year but two since 1988, finishing 2nd in 1994, and winning five 
consecutive Big Ten titles from 2002 to 2006.[28] The men's team has qualified 
for the NCAA 24 times in the last 34 years, with a highest finish of 4th. 
Michigan men have won seven Big Ten titles in that period. The Wolverines 
have won a record 929 games and have the most all-time wins and the highest 
winning percentage in college football history. Michigan won the inaugural 
Rose Bowl in 1902, the first college bowl game ever played. The Wolverine 
football program has claimed 11 national titles.[29] Michigan's 11 national 
championships have come under the direction of five coaches. The first 
six were garnered by the team's first coaching superstar, Fielding H. Yost. 
Yost directed his "Point-a-Minute" teams to four consecutive national titles 
from 1901 to 1904, amassing a record of 41–0–1. Yost also led Michigan 
to national titles in 1918 and 1923. Yost was instrumental in the creation 
of Michigan Stadium and designed it to permit its expansion to expand to 
a capacity of over 150,000. Yost's legacy also lives on with Yost Ice Arena, 
where Michigan's men's ice hockey team plays their home games. Michigan 
football has won five more national titles since Yost permanently retired 
in 1926. The Wolverines won back-to-back titles under Harry Kipke in 1932 
and 1933 and two more consecutive championships under Fritz Crisler and 
Bennie Oosterbaan in 1947 and 1948. Michigan won its most recent national 
title under Lloyd Carr in 1997. Michigan's famous football coaches include: 
Yost, who came to Michigan from Stanford University in 1901, Fritz Crisler, 
who guided Michigan to a pair of Big Ten Conference championships and the 
1947 national title, has his name carried by the home of Michigan men's 
basketball team, Bo Schembechler won 13 Big Ten titles in his 21 seasons 
as head coach between 1969 and 1989, the first in 1969 when he beat his 
friend and mentor Woody Hayes, beginning of "The Ten Year War" era of the 
Michigan – Ohio State football rivalry, Lloyd Carr won five Big Ten titles 
in his 13 seasons at the helm and posted a winning percentage of .753. 
His winning percentage of .779 in conference play trails only that of Schembechler 
in Michigan history, Rich Rodriguez succeeded Carr following his retirement 
in 2007. Rodriguez coached the Wolverines through the 2010 season, compiling 
a record of 15–22. Michigan Stadium is the largest football-only stadium 
in the world, with an official capacity of 107,601.[citation needed] Actual 
attendance, however, regularly exceeds that figure, and the stadium holds 
the NCAA single-game attendance record of 115,109, set on September 7, 
2013 at Michigan's night game against Notre Dame. After a series of expansions, 
the stadium's capacity has continued to end in "-01" to denote an "extra 
seat" in honor of Fritz Crisler. Michigan Stadium has witnessed over 300 
consecutive crowds of greater than 100,000, a streak that dates back to 
November 8, 1975. Michigan has a major rivalry with Ohio State, considered 
one of the fiercest rivalries in American sports. In a pair of ESPN fan 
polls, in 2000 and 2003, the Michigan–Ohio State series was voted the greatest 
rivalry in sports in America.[30] Michigan's meeting with Ohio State is 
almost always the last game of the two schools' regular seasons and has 
provided many memorable contests, such as the "Snow Bowl" of 1950. The 
game has frequently decided the Big Ten Champion. Michigan leads the series 
58–46–6. The contest on November 18, 2006 marked the first time ever these 
teams had been ranked No. 1 and No. 2 going into the game, and the first 
time they were both undefeated since 1973. The 2007 college football match-up 
between Ohio State and Michigan was predicted to be the No. 2 college football 
game to watch in 2007 by SI.com's "Top 20 Games To Watch in 2007" list.[31] 
Michigan has an intrastate rival in Michigan State; the schools' football 
teams compete for the Paul Bunyan Trophy. Michigan leads the series 68–34–5. 
Michigan also enjoys a spirited rivalry with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. 
Michigan leads the series 24–17–1. The two schools are among the top college 
football programs in all-time wins (Michigan first, Notre Dame third) and 
winning percentage (Michigan first, Notre Dame second) in the NCAA Division 
I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A), so it is perhaps fitting 
that when college football was in its infancy, students from the University 
of Michigan traveled to South Bend to teach the game to students there. 
The Wolverines also have a tradition-rich history with the Minnesota Golden 
Gophers. The two football teams compete for the Little Brown Jug, a five-gallon 
jug with the respective schools' "M"s on either side and the scores of 
previous games down the middle. The Little Brown Jug was the first trophy 
played for between college football teams. Through 2014, Michigan leads 
the Brown Jug series 69–23–3. Women's field hockey became a varsity sport 
at Michigan in 1973.[32] The Wolverines field hockey team won the 2001 
NCAA title, which was the school's first national title in a women's team 
sport.[33] Marcia Pankratz served as the head coach of the program from 
1996 to 2004 and returned to the position in 2009.[32] The Wolverines have 
won a total of eight Big Ten regular season titles and five Big Ten tournaments.[32] 
Men's golf has been a varsity sport at Michigan since 1919. The team's 
first coach was elocution and oratory professor Thomas Trueblood who served 
as coach from 1920–1935. Trueblood led the Michigan golf team to consecutive 
national championships in 1934 and 1935. Two coaches, Bert Katzenmeyer 
(1947–1968) and Jim Carras (1982–2002), have had tenures of at least 20 
years with the program. Andrew Sapp has been the coach since 2002. In 2009, 
Sapp led the team to its best record in more than 50 years with 6th-place 
finish at the NCAA championship finals.[34] Chris Whitten became head coach 
in 2011 and led the team to a runner-up finish in 2013. Three Michigan 
golfers have won the individual intercollegiate golf championships: John 
Fischer (1932), Chuck Kocsis (1936), and Dave Barclay (1947).[35] The team 
has won the Big Ten Conference Championship 12 times: 1932–36, 1942–44, 
1946–47, 1949, and 1952. Women's golf has been a varsity sport at Michigan 
since 1976. Cheryl Stacy, a former All-American golfer for Ohio State, 
took over as the team's head coach in 2009.[36] In the fall of 2009, Stacy 
signed a trio of highly rated high school golfers from Ohio, Florida and 
Georgia to national letters of intent for the 2010–11 academic year.[37] 
The Michigan men's gymnastics team has won 6 NCAA championships, 17 Big 
Ten championships and have been invited to 32 NCAA tournaments. Newt Loken 
was the head coach for 36 years from 1948–1983, during which time he coached 
the Wolverines to two NCAA team gymnastics championships, two NCAA team 
trampoline championships, and 21 NCAA individual event championships.[38][39] 
Since 1999, head coach Kurt Golder has led Michigan to national championships 
in 1999, 2010, 2013, 2014 and the Super Six at the NCAA tournament in 13 
of the last 14 seasons. Until 1969, men's trampoline was one of the events 
that comprised the NCAA gymnastics championships. At that time, the event 
was removed in order to conform to the international gymnastics itinerary. 
The NCAA then bestowed a separate national title in trampoline for two 
years, both won by Michigan.[40][41] Women's gymnastics has been a varsity 
sport at Michigan since 1976. Bev Plocki has been the head coach of the 
women's gymnastics team since 1990. Under Plocki's leadership, the Wolverines 
have won 16 Big Ten championships, advanced to 16 consecutive NCAA tournaments 
(1993–2008) and had seven seasons in which they finished in the Top 5 at 
the NCAA tournament. The Wolverines ice hockey team, which was a member 
of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association until 2013 and is now a member 
of the Big Ten Conference, plays its home contests at Yost Ice Arena. It 
is coached by Red Berenson, a former UM player. Altogether, the program 
has won nine NCAA national championships (1948, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1955, 
1956, 1964, 1996, 1998), which is also an NCAA record. In 2011, the team 
was invited to the NCAA tournament for a record 21st year in a row. In 
2011, Michigan reached the national semi-finals (now referred to as the 
"Frozen Four") for an unmatched 24th time. Vic Heyliger led Michigan to 
a record six NCAA titles, including the first one in college hockey history 
in 1948. Heyliger, who played for the Wolverines from 1935–37, also won 
national titles as Michigan coach in 1951, 1952, 1953, 1955 and 1956. He 
was inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame in 1974, in recognition 
of his lifetime achievement. Heyliger is considered instrumental in getting 
the NCAA Tournament off the ground. Following the 1946–47 season, Heyliger 
wrote to each of the college coaches around the country to see if they 
would be interested in creating a national tournament. They obliged and 
the inaugural four-team NCAA tournament began the following season in 1948. 
Heyliger was 228–61–13 as head coach at Michigan, and his .776 winning 
percentage is the best at the school. His only losing season was his first 
year, 3–6 in 1944–45. In 1980, Heyliger was inducted into the University 
of Michigan Hall of Honor. The Vic Heyliger Trophy has been given out at 
the end of each season by the Michigan hockey team to recognize its most 
outstanding defenseman. The Michigan men's lacrosse team is one of the 
oldest collegiate lacrosse programs in the midwest, having been founded 
in 1940,[42] the program is also the most successful athletic program at 
Michigan, with an .830 all-time win percentage. The program was elevated 
from varsity-club status to NCAA status by the university in May 2011 and 
will begin NCAA Division I competition in 2012.[43] The Wolverines previously 
competed at the Division I level of the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association 
(MCLA), in the Central Collegiate Lacrosse Association (CCLA). In 2008 
the team became the first MCLA team to complete a season undefeated, finishing 
20–0 and winning their first national championship at Texas Stadium. The 
feat was repeated in 2009 with another 20–0 season and earned their second 
national championship with a 12–11 victory over Chapman University at Dick's 
Sporting Goods Park in Denver, Colorado. In 2010, they won their third 
MCLA national championship in a row, defeating Arizona State University 
12–11 in Denver. In 2008 Michigan faceoff specialist Brekan Kohlitz became 
the first MCLA player ever selected in the Major League Lacrosse draft 
when he was taken in the 5th round by the Washington Bayhawks. Michigan 
head coach John Paul is in his 13th year at his alma mater and has an overall 
record of 205–42 which includes 10 conference titles in 1999, 2000, 2001, 
2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. Michigan Lacrosse is the 
MCLA Division I National Champions in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Women's rowing 
has been a varsity at sport at Michigan since 1996. Mark Rothstein has 
been the team's coach for 18 years – since it was a club sport in 1991. 
Rothstein led the rowing program "from an over-achieving club squad to 
one of the nation's top-notch varsity rowing programs."[44] The team has 
placed in the Top 10 at the NCAA tournament ten times in the past 12 years. 
The team's best seasons came in 2000–01 and 2011–12 with Big Ten championships 
and second-place finishes in the NCAA tournament.[45] The men's soccer 
team plays Michigan State annually for the rights to the Big Bear Trophy, 
a wooden sculpture purchased by Michigan head coach Steve Burns in 2000.[46] 
Recently, the men's soccer team won the 2010 Big Ten Tournament Championship, 
their first in program history, and advanced to the College Cup, also their 
first in program history. The women's soccer team has played at the varsity 
level since 1994 and has twice won the Big Ten conference tournament, in 
1997 and 1999.[47] It has also reached the quarterfinals of the NCAA Division 
I Women's Soccer Championship once, in 2002 during the tenure of Debbie 
Rademacher, who coached the team from its inception until 2007.[47] The 
team is currently coached by former United States women's national soccer 
team head coach Greg Ryan.[48] Carol Hutchins has been the head coach of 
the Michigan Wolverines softball team since 1985. with a career record 
of 1274–435–4 (.745 winning percentage), Hutchins has more wins than any 
other coach in the history of the university—in both men's and women's 
athletics. Hutchins' teams have won 16 Big Ten championships and appeared 
in 21 NCAA tournaments. In June 2005, the team won the Division 1 NCAA 
Softball Championship, defeating two-time defending champion and perennial 
softball power UCLA two games to one. The decisive game was won with a 
Samantha Findlay walk-off home run in the 10th inning producing a 4–1 final. 
Michigan is the first school east of the Mississippi River to win the Women's 
College World Series since it was first done in 1976 (Carol Hutchins played 
shortstop on that team, Michigan State). The Wolverines have appeared in 
twelve Women's College World Series in 1982, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2001, 
2002, 2004, 2005, 2009, 2013 and 2015.[49] Men's swimming and diving has 
been a varsity sport at Michigan since 1921.[50] With 19 NCAA national 
championships[41][51] (7 were unofficial),[52] including the 2013 NCAA 
championship, the Michigan men's swimming and diving team has won more 
national championships than any other varsity sport in the history of the 
university. In addition to its 19 national championships, the team has 
finished in the Top 5 nationally 48 times.[50] The team's swimmers have 
also won 145 individual NCAA championships.[53] Three head coaches have 
led the squad for a combined 77 years: Matt Mann (1925–54), Gus Stager 
(1954–82) and Jon Urbanchek (1982–2004).[54] Michigan swimmers and divers 
inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame include Mike Barrowman, 
Dick Degener, Tom Dolan, Taylor Drysdale, Bruce Harlan, Harry Holiday, 
Dick Kimball, Carl Robie, and Bob Webster.[55] Mike Bottom took over as 
the team's head coach in 2008. In his first season as the team's head coach, 
Bottom led the Wolverines to a Big Ten championship and a 7th-place finish 
at the NCAA championship.[56] In 2013, Bottom won the program's 12th official 
NCAA national championship (19th overall) and its first since 1995. Women's 
swimming and diving has been a varsity sport at Michigan since 1974. The

1978. The team has won 15 Big Ten titles (eight outdoor and seven indoor). 
James Henry has been the head coach since 1984. The Wolverines have had 
their strongest finishes in the NCAA tournament in recent years—finishing 
third in the 2007 outdoor tournament and third in the 2008 indoor tournament.[63] 
Notable alumna include Lisa Larsen Weidenbach Rainsberger, who won the 
Boston and Chicago Marathons.[64] The women's volleyball program at the 
University of Michigan began in 1973. Mark Rosen has been the head coach 
since 1999 and has led the team to the NCAA Tournament in 12 of his 14 
years as head coach. Women's water polo became a varsity sport at the University 
of Michigan in 2001. In its first nine years, the program has placed first 
in the conference nine times, won eight NCAA division titles and four NCAA 
eastern titles, and appeared four times in the NCAA national tournament. 
The Wolverines finished in the Top 5 at the national tournament in 2002 
and 2009. In the spring of 2014, the Athletic Department hired Dr. Marcelo 
Leonardi as their new head coach. Dr. Marcelo Leonardi is in his first 
season as head coach for the Michigan women's water polo team. Leonardi 
took over the Michigan women's water polo program after spending the past 
five seasons as the women's water polo coach at California State University 
in Northridge. He also serves as the national technical director for the 
women's Olympic Development Program (ODP) associated with the organization 
since 2013. Caitlin Haskell, the assistant coach, played varsity water 
polo at University of California, Irvine. The Wolverines enter their 15th 
season in 2015.[65][66] Former Olympic Gold Medalist Betsey Armstrong was 
hired as the assistant coach in 2012.[67] Wrestling has been a varsity 
sport at Michigan since 1921. The Wolverines have finished in the Top 5 
in the NCAA tournament 16 times.[citation needed] Home dual meets and tournaments 
take place at Cliff Keen Arena, dedicated and named after longtime wrestling 
coach Cliff Keen, who coached the team from 1925 until 1970 and led the 
Wolverines Wrestling team to 13 Big Ten Conference championships. The Michigan 
wrestling team has produced 175 individual NCAA All-Americans dating back 
to 1928, has 22 individual NCAA Championships for the university, and received 
2 winners of the NCAA Most Outstanding Wrestler Award (1940, 1978).[68] 
A few notable former Wolverine Wrestlers include Olympic Gold medalist 
Steve Fraser, 1978 NCAA Most Outstanding Wrestler Mark Churella, and 2006 
Greco-Roman World Wrestling Champion Joe Warren, currently a Mixed Martial 
Artist for Bellator Fighting Championship. Michigan Athletics announced 
in July 2015 that it would switch from sponsorship by Adidas to Nike. The 
deal at the time had an estimated value of $169 million and was described 
as "the richest apparel deal in intercollegiate athletics".[69][70] In 
April 2016, the University announced the signing of an 11-year $127.12 
million contract for 31 Michigan sports teams, going into effect on August 
1.[71] With the agreement, Michigan Wolverines football became the first 
football program to wear Jordan Brand attire accompanied by the jumpman 
logo.[72][73] Nike identifies the yellow color in the new uniforms as "Amarillo" 
rather than the traditional "Maize".[74] In 2000, athletic director Bill 
Martin announced the creation of a special level for sports at Michigan 
called Varsity Club status. The new system was established to recognize 
and increase support for club sports teams that have reached a level of 
budget, organization and competition that is similar to varsity levels. 
Varsity club squads are not necessarily closer to being elevated to full 
varsity status, and will remain for the time being primarily self-funded 
and administered through the Department of Recreational Sports. However, 
the designation will give these teams a closer relationship to the U-M 
athletic department.[75] The Varsity Club status has proven to be a launching 
pad for sports to eventually become varsity sports at Michigan. In May 
2011, Men's and Women's Lacrosse were officially granted varsity status. 
Men's Lacrosse began their first season of NCAA competition in 2012 while 
the Women's program will begin varsity competition in 2014. Current Varsity 
Club Sports: The Club Sports Program at the University of Michigan, administered 
by the Department of Recreational Sports, comprises 35 club sports. Each 
club sport is a student-led organization composed primarily of students, 
faculty, and staff. Each club is formed, developed, governed, and administered 
by the student membership of that particular club, working with the Club 
Sports Program staff. The club sports programs include: The University 
of Michigan Rugby Football Club plays college rugby in the Big Ten Universities 
conference of Division 1-A against its traditional rivals such as Michigan 
State and Ohio State. The Michigan rugby club was formed in 1959, although 
rugby at Michigan dates back to at least 1890 before fading from campus.[76] 
Michigan rugby is led by head coach Brandon Sparks.[77] Michigan reached 
the 2013 Big Ten championship match, where they lost to Indiana 58–38.[78] 
Michigan played in the 2014 Collegiate Rugby Championship, notching some 
upset wins to reach the quarterfinals in a tournament broadcast live on 
NBC from PPL Park in Philadelphia. Michigan returned to the 2015 Collegiate 
Rugby Championship, where they notched wins against UCLA and Texas to again 
reach the quarterfinals.[79][80] In the NCAA Division I Director's Cup 
(renamed Learfield Sports Directors' Cup), Michigan has ranked No. 1 in 
the Big Ten rankings in 12 out of the last 23 years ending in 2015–16; 
the university has ranked in the top 5 nationally a total of 12 years during 
that 23-year span. Through the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, 204 UM students 
and coaches had participated in the Olympics, winning medals in every Summer 
Olympics except 1896, and winning gold medals in all but four Olympiads. 
Through the year 2016,UM students have won a total of 151 Olympic medals:
