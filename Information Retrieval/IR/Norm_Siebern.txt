Norman Leroy "Norm" Siebern (July 26, 1933 â€“ October 30, 2015) was a Major 
League Baseball player for the New York Yankees, Kansas City Athletics, 
Baltimore Orioles, California Angels, San Francisco Giants, and Boston 
Red Sox from 1956 to 1968. His best season came in 1962 with the A's, when 
he hit 25 home runs, had 117 runs batted in and a .308 batting average. 
He might be most remembered however, as being one of the players the Yankees 
traded for Roger Maris. He was signed by Yankees scout Lou Maguolo.[1] 
Siebern played for the 1956 and 1958 World Series champion Yankees, and 
nine years later returned to the '67 Series with the Red Sox. On December 
11, 1959, he was part of a seven-player trade that sent him along with 
World Series heroes Don Larsen and Hank Bauer to the Kansas City A's in 
exchange for outfielder Roger Maris and two other players.[2] Maris ended 
up breaking Babe Ruth's single-season home run record in 1961. The Orioles 
acquired Siebern on November 27, 1963 in an exchange of starting first 
basemen, sending Jim Gentile and $25,000 to the Athletics. He spent two 
seasons in Baltimore, losing his starting spot in the middle of 1965 to 
Boog Powell, who successfully made the transition from the outfield. Siebern 
was traded to the Angels on December 2, 1965 for outfielder Dick Simpson. 
Seven days later, Simpson would be one of three players sent to the Cincinnati 
Reds for Frank Robinson.[3] Siebern made the American League All-Star teams 
in 1962, 1963 and 1964. He had 1,217 hits for his career, with 132 home 
runs and a lifetime batting average of .272. Siebern attended Southwest 
Missouri State, where he played basketball with future New York baseball 
teammate Jerry Lumpe on a team that won two NAIA Championships in 1952 
and 1953. Both players had to miss some tournament games to report to baseball
