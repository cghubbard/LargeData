The 1960 Pittsburgh Pirates season was the team's 79th season. The team 
finished with a record of 95–59–1, seven games in front of the second-place 
Milwaukee Braves to win their first National League championship in 33 
seasons. The team went on to play the heavily favored New York Yankees, 
whom they defeated 4 games to 3 in one of the most storied World Series 
ever. At the 1959 Winter Meetings, Pirates general manager Joe L. Brown 
had agreed to trade Dick Groat to the Kansas City Athletics in exchange 
for Roger Maris. Pirates manager Danny Murtaugh had advised Brown that 
he did not want to lose Groat, and the deal was never finalized.[2] On 
September 6, team captain Dick Groat was drilled on his left wrist by an 
inside pitch from Braves pitcher Lew Burdette.[4] Groat was lost for the 
rest of the season. Dick Schofield stepped in for the injured Groat and 
went three for three in that September 6 game. The Pirates won the game 
5–3 and Schofield would go on to hit .414 for the rest of the season.[4] 
On September 25 in Milwaukee, the Pirates clinched their first pennant 
in 33 years.[5] Infielders Other batters Coaches The 1960 Pirates team, 
which featured eight All-Stars, was widely predicted to lose the World 
Series to a powerful New York Yankees team.[citation needed] In one of 
the most memorable World Series in history, the Pirates were defeated by 
more than ten runs in three games, won three close games, then recovered 
from a 7–4 deficit late in Game 7 to eventually win on a walk-off home 
run by Bill Mazeroski, a second baseman better known for defensive wizardry.
