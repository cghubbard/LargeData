Elections to Baseball Hall of Fame for 1960 followed a system established 
after the 1956 election. The Veterans Committee was meeting only in odd-numbered 
years (until 1962). The Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) 
voted by mail to select from recent major league players and, same as in 
1958, it elected no one. For the third and final time the induction ceremonies 
in Cooperstown were canceled because there was no one to induct. It was 
also the last time until 2013 that there were no living inductees (all 
three members of that induction class, all deceased, were voted in by the 
Veterans Committee).[1] The BBWAA was authorized to elect players active 
in 1930 or later, but not after 1954. All 10-year members of the BBWAA 
were eligible to vote. Voters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 
candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots 
would be honored with induction to the Hall. A total of 133 players received 
votes; 269 ballots were cast, with 202 votes required for election. A total 
of 2,288 individual votes were cast, an average of 8.51 per ballot. Candidates 
who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a †. Candidates 
who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in italics. 
Copies of the 1958 and 1960 ballots are not available, reportedly listing 
"about 400" and 237 players. Eight candidates may have received votes for 
the first time who were previously eligible: Miller, White, Kress, Crowder, 
Danning, Keltner, Walberg, and Zachary (in table order). The votes for 
Ralph Kiner may have been write-ins; he played until 1955 and should have 
been ineligible. Lefty Grove received six votes despite the fact that he 
had already been elected to the Hall of Fame, in 1947. The next ballot 
for 1962 did not include a list of names. Twenty-six candidates who received 
at least one vote in 1960 may have been eligible for the final time: Edd 
Roush, Hank Gowdy, Bucky Harris, Dave Bancroft, Joe Sewell, Nick Altrock, 
Joe Judge, Howard Ehmke, Eddie Rommel, Wally Schang, Cy Williams, Bob Meusel, 
Joe Dugan, Babe Herman, Lew Fonseca, Mike González, Marty McManus, Jack 
Quinn, Bill Sherdel, Sparky Adams, Ray Blades, Heinie Groh, Bubbles Hargrave,
