XTRA Sports 1150 Vin Scully, Ross Porter, Rick Monday The 1999 season started 
with a new management team; Kevin Malone became the team's General Manager 
and Davey Johnson was selected to be the new Dodgers Manager. Looking to 
make a splash, Malone exclaimed "There is a new Sheriff in town" [1] as 
he took over the reins and made a splash by signing starting pitcher Kevin 
Brown to a huge long contract. However, the team struggled to a third-place 
finish in the Western Division of the National League. 1999 Los Angeles 
Dodgers Infielders Coaches The Dodgers selected 50 players in this draft. 
Of those, seven of them would eventually play Major League baseball. They 
lost their first round pick to the San Diego Padres and their third round 
pick to the Baltimore Orioles as a result of their signing free agent pitchers 
Kevin Brown and Alan Mills. They also gained a supplemental first round 
pick and a second round pick as compensation for losing pitcher Scott Radinsky 
to free agency and a supplemental second round pick as compensation for 
pitcher Brian Bohanon. The first round pick was shortstop Jason Repko from 
Hanford High School. He was transitioned to the outfield and played seven 
seasons in the majors (4 with the Dodgers). He had several serious injuries 
in his career and was relegated primarily to a backup position. Repko hit 
.224 in 360 MLB games. The draft class also included outfielder Shane Victorino, 
who was drafted in the sixth round out of St. Anthony High School in Hawaii. 
He was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2004 Rule 5 draft and 
proceeded to become a two-time All-Star and two-time World Series champion.
