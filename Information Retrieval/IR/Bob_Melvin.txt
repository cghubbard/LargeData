As player As manager As coach Robert Paul Melvin (born October 28, 1961) 
is an American professional baseball catcher, coach, and manager. He is 
currently the manager of the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball. 
During a 10-year playing career from 1985 through 1994, Melvin was a catcher 
for the Detroit Tigers, San Francisco Giants, Baltimore Orioles, Kansas 
City Royals, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, and Chicago White Sox. In 
his managing career he has worked for the Seattle Mariners (2003–04), Arizona 
Diamondbacks (2005–09), and Oakland Athletics (2011–present). Melvin was 
named the National League Manager of the Year in 2007 and the American 
League Manager of the Year in 2012. Born in Palo Alto, California, Melvin 
played baseball at Menlo-Atherton High School in Atherton, south of San 
Francisco. After graduation in 1979, he enrolled at the University of California 
in Berkeley and played catcher for the Golden Bears. As a freshman, he 
helped lead Cal to a 44–23–1 (.654) record and a third-place finish at 
the College World Series in 1980. Melvin finished his freshman season batting 
.269 with two doubles and 12 RBI in 29 games. Following his sophomore season 
at California, Melvin was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the secondary 
phase of the 1981 draft and played eleven seasons, mostly as a starting 
catcher, for the Detroit Tigers, San Francisco Giants, Baltimore Orioles, 
Kansas City Royals, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees and Chicago White 
Sox. He finished his career with a batting average of .233 and 35 home 
runs. As a Giant, he served as the backup for fellow catcher Bob Brenly, 
who, like him, went on to manage the Diamondbacks. He managed the Seattle 
Mariners in 2003 and 2004, following the ten-year run of Lou Piniella. 
The M's won 93 games, but missed the playoffs, finishing three games behind 
Oakland in the division and two behind Boston for the one wild card spot. 
The following season was less successful, as the Mariners lost 99 games 
and Melvin's contract was not extended. He finished with a 156–168 record 
as Mariners manager.[1] He returned to the Diamondbacks for whom he previously 
had been bench coach before being hired by the Mariners. Melvin was the 
second manager the Diamondbacks hired for 2005, after they fired Wally 
Backman before he managed a single game due to revelations of past arrests 
and serious financial troubles.[2] Melvin led Arizona to a National League 
West title in 2007 with a record of 90–72. The Diamondbacks entered the 
playoffs as the No. 1 seed in the National League. They swept the Chicago 
Cubs in the NLDS, but then were swept themselves in the NLCS by the Colorado 
Rockies. Even so, Melvin was named National League Sporting News Manager 
of the Year and MLB Manager of the Year for 2007. His nickname was "The 
Mad Scientist" because of his mental approach to the game. Melvin was fired 
as manager and replaced by A.J. Hinch, another former catcher, after the 
May 8, 2009 game.[3] Melvin finished with a 337–340 regular season record 
and a 3–4 post–season record as Diamondbacks manager.[1] Following the 
2009 season, Melvin was a candidate to be the next manager of the Houston 
Astros.[4] However, the position was filled by Brad Mills.[5] He was interviewed 
by the Milwaukee Brewers for their managerial opening in October 2010, 
and was believed to be a finalist along with Bobby Valentine, Joey Cora 
and Ron Roenicke.[6] The position eventually went to Angel bench coach, 
Roenicke. He was then interviewed by the New York Mets for their managerial 
opening before the 2011 season, but the position eventually was awarded 
to former Astros and Angels manager, Terry Collins. In 2011, he was named 
interim manager of the Oakland Athletics on June 9,[7] then on September 
21, was promoted to manager of the A's, and agreed to a three-year contract 
extension after guiding the team to a 47–52 record[1] (74–88 overall). 
Melvin went on the Chris Townsend Show in the Bay Area after the first 
game of the 2012 season in Tokyo, and promised the fans that the A's would 
work hard every game. He managed the A's to the franchise's best-ever record 
in July at 19–5. On October 1, the A's clinched their first playoff appearance 
since 2006, and two days later clinched the Western Division of the American 
League. The A's lost the 2012 ALDS (West Division) to the Detroit Tigers, 
three games to two. Melvin was honored as the 2012 American League Manager 
of the Year. During the 2013 season, Melvin's second full season at the 
helm, the A's continued what began the previous year, posting winning records 
for every month of the season and securing a second consecutive AL West 
Division Championship. Employing numerous platoons, Athletics' outfielder 
Josh Reddick referred to Melvin as the "king of platoons".[8] Melvin is 
Jewish,[9][10][11][12][13][14] the son of a Jewish mother and a Catholic 
father.[9][10][14] He resides in Berkeley and in Greenwich Village in New 
York City, with his wife, Kelley.[15] He has one daughter, Alexi (born 
December 21, 1988), who is an actress, writer, and filmmaker.[16][17][18] 
Melvin and his family are very active with the Juvenile Diabetes Research 
Foundation, Alexi having been diagnosed with juvenile diabetes at age 14.[16][19]
