Luis Severino (born February 20, 1994) is a Dominican professional baseball 
pitcher for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). He is 
considered the Yankees' top prospect by numerous scouts.[1] Severino signed 
with the New York Yankees as an international free agent in 2012, agreeing 
on a $225,000 signing bonus.[2] At the time, he could throw his fastball 
at 91 miles per hour (146 km/h).[3] He made his professional debut for 
the Dominican Summer League (DSL) Yankees 1 that year. He started 14 games, 
pitching to a 4–2 win-loss record with a 1.68 earned run average (ERA) 
and 45 strikeouts in 64 1⁄3 innings. He started 2013 with the DSL Yankees 
1 and was promoted to the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic 
League during the season. He finished 4–2 with a 2.45 ERA, 53 strikeouts 
over 44 innings in 10 games (eight starts).[4] His fastball velocity reached 
97 miles per hour (156 km/h) at Charleston.[3] Prior to the 2014 season, 
Baseball America ranked him as the Yankees ninth best prospect.[4] Severino 
started the season with Charleston before being promoted to the Tampa Yankees 
of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. After his promotion to Tampa, 
he was selected to appear in the 2014 All-Star Futures Game in July.[5] 
After the Futures Game, he was again promoted, to the Trenton Thunder of 
the Class AA Eastern League.[2] Combined between the three teams, Severino 
went 6–5 win-loss record with a 2.46 ERA, 127 strikeouts, and 27 walks 
in 24 games (all starts) and 113 innings pitched.[6] Before the start of 
the 2015 season, Severino was ranked the best prospect in the Yankees farm 
system and the 23rd best out of all minor league players.[by whom?] Severino 
began the 2015 season with Trenton, where he had a 2–2 win-loss record 
with a 3.32 ERA and 48 strikeouts in 38 innings pitched across eight games 
started. He received a promotion to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders 
of the Class AAA International League, where he worked with RailRiders' 
pitching coach Scott Aldred to improve his pitching delivery. Severino 
pitched to a 7–0 win-loss record and a 1.91 ERA in 11 games started for 
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre through the end of July.[7] With the Yankees in the 
Major League Baseball (MLB) postseason race, the Yankees made Severino 
unavailable in trade discussions for pitchers David Price, Cole Hamels, 
and Johnny Cueto at the MLB trade deadline of July 31.[8][9][10] With a 
late-July injury to Michael Pineda,[11] and the Yankees not acquiring a 
starting pitcher before the trade deadline, Brian Cashman, the general 
manager of the Yankees, announced that Severino's next start would come 
in the major leagues against the Boston Red Sox, the primary rival of the 
Yankees, at Yankee Stadium.[12] Though Severino set a career-high with 
113 innings pitched in the 2014 season, and teams tend to slowly build 
their pitchers up year to year, Cashman said that Severino will not be 
limited in how many innings he throws over the remainder of the 2015 season, 
in part because they limited his innings earlier in the season.[7] Yankees' 
manager Joe Girardi set Severino's major league debut for August 5.[13] 
Severino pitched five innings in his debut, allowing two hits, two runs 
(one earned), with seven strikeouts and no walks, while becoming the youngest 
starting pitcher of the 2015 MLB season.[14] Also, he became the first 
AL pitcher in MLB history to strike out seven hitters while walking none 
and allowing no more than two hits in their major league debut.[15][16] 
Severino began the 2016 season in the Yankees starting rotation.[17] In 
a game against the Chicago White Sox on May 13, 2016, Severino left the 
game with an apparent injury after giving up 7 runs in 2.2 innings. The 
next day, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to right triceps 
inflammation[18] On May 30, 2016, he was activated from the disabled list, 
and optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes Barre. Severino is from Sabana 
de la Mar, in the Hato Mayor province of the Dominican Republic. He grew 
up a fan of the Yankees, particularly fellow Dominican Robinson Canó.[19]
