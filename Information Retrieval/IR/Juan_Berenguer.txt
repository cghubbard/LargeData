Juan Bautista Berenguer [beh-ren-gher'] (born November 30, 1954) is a former 
Panamanian long relief pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played 
for eight teams from 1978 to 1992. Listed at 5'11 (1.80 m), 200 lb. (91 
k), Berenguer batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Aguadulce, 
Coclé.[1][2] A mean-looking, husky pitcher with long hair and a mustache, 
Berenguer was nicknamed 'Pancho Villa' by his teammates, even though Twins 
fans admiringly referred to him as 'Señor Smoke' or 'El Gasolino' due to 
his mid-90s mph fastball.[1] Extremely wild as a youngster, Berenguer learned 
to harness his sneaky fastball which he liked to throw inside, and added 
a deceptive forkball. His effectiveness was aided by his intimidating appearance 
and disposition. Berenguer was signed by the New York Mets as an amateur 
free agent in 1975. He made his MLB debut with the team in 1978. By April 
1981, Berenguer had a 1-4 win-loss record and a 4.75 earned run average 
(ERA) in 16 career appearances with the team, and he was still having problems 
controlling his fastball, so the Mets traded him to the Kansas City Royals 
in exchange for outfielder Marvell Wynne and pitcher John Skinner.[3] He 
later pitched for seven organizations before joining the Minnesota Twins.[2] 
His breakout season came in 1987, when he posted a 8-1 record with a 3.94 
ERA and four saves for the American League champion Twins, en route to 
the 1987 World Championship over the St. Louis Cardinals.[2] He previously 
won a World Series ring with the 1984 Champion Detroit Tigers, though he 
did not play in the Series.[2] Berenguer suffered one of MLB's oddest off-field 
injuries while pitching for the Atlanta Braves in 1991. On an off day, 
while he was home wrestling with his kids, he broke his pitching arm and 
was placed on the disabled list. He ended up missing the remainder of the 
season, also missing out on the Braves cinderella run to the World Series 
that year.[1] Following his MLB career, Berenguer continued to play in 
the minors. After spending 1993 and part of 1994 in the Mexican League, 
he returned to Minnesota and pitched for the independent Minneapolis Loons 
and Southern Minny Stars in the Prairie League.[2] He then signed to pitch 
for the Duluth–Superior Dukes of the Northern League prior to the 1998 
season, but never played for them. In between, he played winter ball in 
the Dominican Republic and Venezuela.[1] After baseball, Berenguer returned 
to Minnesota, where he worked in marketing for a local television station.[1] 
Berenguer married Denise Colacurcio. His son Chris is a hockey player with
