Antonio María García (1868 – July 24, 1923), nicknamed "El Inglés" ("The 
Englishman"), was a Cuban baseball catcher in the Cuban League. He played 
from 1882 to 1905 with several Cuban ballclubs, including Almendares, the 
Fe club, Habana, and the All Cubans. He was elected to the Cuban Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1939.[1] According to Cuban baseball historian Jorge Figueredo, 
García was "considered by many as the best all-around player of the early 
years" of the Cuban League. When John McGraw visited Cuba in 1889, he reportedly 
wanted to sign García to a contract with Baltimore. García refused because 
he was being paid more in Cuba than what Baltimore offered.[2] García debuted 
with Almendares in the Cuban League in the winter season of 1882/83. The 
league was suspended the following winter, and when it resumed play in 
the spring of 1885, García was playing for Habana, which won the league 
championship. The following winter, he played for Fe, which finished third 
in the five-team league.[3] In 1886/87, García returned to Habana, which 
again won the championship. The next season, he won the batting championship 
with a batting average of .448; he also led the league in hits (26) and 
doubles (6). Nevertheless, his Habana team lost the pennant race to Fe, 
ending the season one game behind.[4] In 1888/89, García's batting average 
dropped to .238, but his Habana team regained the pennant. The next season 
he moved to Fe and won his second batting crown, hitting .369, and also 
led the league in hits (24) and triples (4), while tying for the league 
lead in home runs with one. His team finished in second place, two games 
behind Habana. In 1890/91, García hit .338 and his Fe team won the title,
