Edward Grant Barrow (May 10, 1868 – December 15, 1953) was an American 
manager and front office executive in Major League Baseball. He served 
as the field manager of the Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox. He served 
as business manager (de facto general manager) of the New York Yankees 
from 1921 to 1939 and as team president from 1939 to 1945, and is credited 
with building the Yankee dynasty.[citation needed] Barrow was elected to 
the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953. Born in a covered wagon in Springfield, 
Illinois, Barrow worked as a journalist and soap salesman before entering 
the business of baseball by selling concessions at games. From there, Barrow 
purchased minor league baseball teams, also serving as team manager, and 
served as president of the Atlantic League. After managing the Tigers in 
1903 and 1904 and returning to the minor leagues, Barrow became disenchanted 
with baseball, and left the game to operate a hotel. Barrow returned to 
baseball in 1910 as president of the Eastern League. After a seven-year 
tenure, Barrow managed the Red Sox from 1918 through 1920, leading the 
team to victory in the 1918 World Series. When Red Sox owner Harry Frazee 
began to sell his star players, Barrow joined the Yankees. During his quarter-century 
as their baseball operations chief, the Yankees won 14 AL pennants and 
10 World Series titles. Barrow was born in Springfield, Illinois, the oldest 
of four children, all male, born to Effie Ann Vinson-Heller and John Barrow.[1][2] 
Barrow's father fought in the Ohio Volunteer Militia during the American 
Civil War.[2][3] Following the war, Barrow's parents, with John's mother, 
brothers, and sisters, traveled in a covered wagon to Nebraska; Barrow 
was born on a hemp plantation belonging to relatives during the trip.[2] 
The Barrows lived in Nebraska for six years before moving to Des Moines, 
Iowa.[1] His middle name, Grant, was bestowed on him in honor of Ulysses 
S. Grant, the Civil War general.[2] Barrow worked as mailing clerk for 
the Des Moines News in 1887, receiving a promotion to circulation manager 
within a year.[3] He became a reporter for the Des Moines Leader after 
graduating from high school.[4] He became city editor, earning $35 a week 
($923 in current dollar terms).[5] In his last two years living in Des 
Moines, Barrow established a baseball team, which included future baseball 
stars Fred Clarke, Ducky Holmes, and Herm McFarland.[3][6] Barrow moved 
to Pittsburgh in 1889, where he worked as a soap salesman,[3][5] believing 
there was money in this business.[7] However, Barrow lost all of money 
in this business, and went to work as a desk clerk in a Pittsburgh hotel.[7] 
Barrow partnered with Harry Stevens in 1894 to sell concessions at baseball 
games.[7] He helped George Moreland form the Interstate League, a Class-C 
minor league, in 1894.[3] Barrow, with Stevens and Al Buckenberger, purchased 
the Wheeling Nailers of the Interstate League in 1896.[3] Barrow served 
as field manager until the collapse of the league that season.[1] The team 
continued in the Iron and Oil League for the rest of the year.[3] Barrow 
then bought the Paterson Silk Weavers of the Class-A Atlantic League, managing 
them for the rest of the 1896 season.[1] Barrow discovered Honus Wagner 
throwing lumps of coal at a railroad station in Pennsylvania, and signed 
him to his first professional contract.[1][4][8] Barrow sold Wagner to 
the Louisville Colonels of the National League (NL) for $2,100 the next 
year ($59,833 in current dollar terms).[1] With poor attendance, Barrow 
brought in professional boxers as a draw: he had James J. Corbett play 
first base while John L. Sullivan and James J. Jeffries umpired.[9] He 
also hired Lizzie Arlington, the first woman in professional baseball, 
to pitch a few innings a game.[9] From 1897 through 1899, Barrow served 
as president of the Atlantic League.[1] During this time, in the winter 
of 1898–99, Barrow and Jake Wells established a movie theater in Richmond, 
Virginia.[3] Barrow managed Paterson again in 1899, but the league folded 
after the season.[1] With the money earned from the sale of the Richmond 
movie theater, Barrow purchased a one-quarter share of the Toronto Maple 
Leafs of the Class-A Eastern League in 1900 from Arthur Irwin,[3] and served 
as the team's manager.[1] Irwin, hired to be the manager of the Washington 
Senators of the NL, brought his most talented players with him.[3] Rebuilding 
the Maple Leafs, Barrow acquired talented players, such as Nick Altrock, 
and the team improved from a fifth-place finish in 1899, to a third-place 
finish in 1900, and a second-place finish in 1901.[3] The Maple Leafs won 
the league championship in 1902, even though they lost many of their most 
talented players, including Altrock, to the upstart American League (AL).[1] 
Barrow managed in the major leagues with the Detroit Tigers of the AL in 
1903, finishing fifth, a thirteen-game improvement from their 1902 finish.[1] 
With the Tigers, Barrow feuded with shortstop Kid Elberfeld.[1] Tigers' 
owner Sam Angus sold the team to William Yawkey before the 1904 season.[1] 
Barrow managed the Tigers again in 1904, but unable to coexist with Frank 
Navin, Yawkey's secretary-treasurer, Barrow tendered his resignation.[1] 
He then managed the Montreal Royals of the Eastern League for the rest 
of the season.[1] He managed the Indianapolis Indians of the Class-A American 
Association in 1905 and Toronto in 1906.[1] Disheartened with baseball 
after finishing in last place, Barrow hired Joe Kelley to manage Toronto 
in 1907, and after signing the rest of the team's players, became manager 
of the Windsor Arms Hotel in Toronto.[1][3] Barrow returned to baseball 
in 1910, managing Montreal.[1] The Eastern League hired Barrow as its president 
the next year, giving him an annual salary of $7,500 ($190,795 in current 
dollar terms).[10][11] He served in this role from 1911 through 1917, and 
engineered the name change to "International League" before the 1912 season.[1] 
As league president, he contended with the creation of the Federal League 
in 1914, which competed as a major league, and established franchises in 
International League cities, including Newark, New Jersey, Buffalo, New 
York, and Baltimore, Maryland.[3] He attempted to gain major league status 
for the league in 1914, but was unsuccessful.[1] When the Federal League 
collapsed, Barrow was the only league president to forbid the outlaw players 
from playing in his league.[3] After the 1917 season, Barrow attempted 
to organize the "Union League", to compete against the AL and NL as a third 
major league, by merging four International League clubs with four teams 
from the American Association.[12] Several International League owners 
opposed Barrow's policies, including his attempt to form the Union League, 
and felt he was too close personally to Ban Johnson.[13] When the league's 
owners voted to cut his pay to $2,500 after the 1917 season ($46,253 in 
current dollar terms), Barrow resigned.[1][13] Barrow became manager of 
the Boston Red Sox in 1918. As the team lost many of its better players 
during World War I, Barrow encouraged owner Harry Frazee to purchase Stuffy 
McInnis, Wally Schang, Bullet Joe Bush, and Amos Strunk from the Philadelphia 
Athletics for $75,000 ($1,181,914 in current dollar terms).[7] During the 
season, Barrow feuded with his assistant, Johnny Evers, who undermined 
Barrow's leadership.[14] The Red Sox won the 1918 World Series. Recognizing 
that star pitcher Babe Ruth was also a great power hitter, Barrow had Ruth 
pinch hit on days when he wasn't scheduled to pitch.[7] When Ruth told 
Barrow that he could only pitch or hit, Barrow decided that Ruth's bat 
was more useful than his pitching, and transitioned him from a pitcher 
into an outfielder.[7][15] After the 1918 season, Frazee, now in debt, 
began selling the contracts of star players. He traded Dutch Leonard, Duffy 
Lewis, and Ernie Shore to the New York Yankees, obtaining Ray Caldwell, 
Slim Love, Frank Gilhooley, Roxy Walters, and cash.[16] Frazee sold Carl 
Mays to the Yankees during the 1919 season.[17] The Red Sox struggled in 
1919, finishing sixth in the AL.[18] Frazee sold Ruth to the Yankees after 
the season, against Barrow's warnings.[1] The Red Sox finished in fifth 
in 1920.[19] After the 1920 season, Barrow resigned from the Red Sox to 
become the business manager of the Yankees, replacing the deceased Harry 
Sparrow.[1][20] He took control of building the roster, which was usually 
the field manager's responsibility in those days. With the Yankees, Barrow 
handled the signing of player contracts, although owner Jacob Ruppert personally 
handled the contracts of Ruth and Lou Gehrig.[15] Barrow installed himself 
in the Yankees' infrastructure between co-owner Tillinghast L'Hommedieu 
Huston and manager Miller Huggins, as Huston frequently criticized Huggins. 
Barrow told Huggins: "You're the manager, and you'll not be second guessed 
by me. Your job is to win; mine is to get you the players you need to win."[1] 
When Huggins suspended Ruth indefinitely on August 29, 1925 for "misconduct 
off the playing field", while also fining him $5,000 ($67,581 in current 
dollar terms),[21] Barrow supported Huggins.[1] In his first move with 
the Yankees, Barrow brought Red Sox coach Paul Krichell with him to New 
York as a scout.[1][8] He purchased a share in the club in 1924.[22][23] 
He also discovered executive George Weiss, whom he mentored.[8] Barrow 
also orchestrated a series of trades with his former club, mainly to keep 
Frazee afloat. These trades netted the Yankees such stars as Bullet Joe 
Bush, Joe Dugan and George Pipgras. It has been argued that these trades 
only looked lopsided in favor of the Yankees only because the players sent 
to Boston suffered a rash of injuries.[24] However, this is belied by the 
fact that Barrow almost certainly knew who was coming to New York in these 
deals; he'd managed nearly all of them in Boston.[25] The Yankees sought 
to develop their own players, rather than buying them from other teams, 
especially after the investment of $100,000 ($1,364,559 in current dollar 
terms) in Lyn Lary and Jimmie Reese in 1927.[26] However, Weiss and Bill 
Essick convinced Barrow to approve the purchase of Joe DiMaggio from the 
Pacific Coast League.[26] Barrow was considered a potential successor to 
AL president Ban Johnson in 1927, but Barrow declared that he was not interested 
in the job.[27] When Huggins died in 1929, Barrow chose Bob Shawkey to 
replace him as manager, passing over Ruth, who wanted the opportunity to 
become a player-manager.[15] Barrow also effectively blackballed Ruth from 
MLB's managerial ranks by suggesting to executives of other teams that 
Ruth was not equipped to manage a baseball team. Although Ruth and Barrow 
had been together for all but one season from 1918 to 1934, the two had 
never gotten along.[15] The Sporting News named Barrow their Executive 
of the Year in 1937.[28] After Ruppert's death in 1939, his will left the 
Yankees and other assets in a trust for his descendants. The will also 
named Barrow president of the Yankees, with full authority over the team's 
day-to-day operations.[1][5] Barrow was named Executive of the Year by 
The Sporting News in 1941, the second time he won the award.[29] The estate 
sold the team to a group of Larry MacPhail, Dan Topping, and Del Webb in 
1945, and Barrow sold his 10% stake in the team to the group.[30][31] Barrow 
remained as chairman of the board and an informal adviser.[31] Though he 
signed a five-year contract to remain with the team, he exercised a clause 
in his contract to free himself as of December 31, 1946, in order to officially 
retire from baseball.[1][32] AL president Will Harridge offered Barrow 
the job of Commissioner of Baseball to succeed Kenesaw Mountain Landis; 
Barrow declined, as he felt he was too old and his health was in decline.[33][34] 
Barrow was known as "Uncle Egbert" to his friends;[33] according to writer 
Tom Meany, Babe Ruth referred to him as "Barrows," treating him as if he 
were "a butler in an English drawing room comedy." He resided in Rye, New 
York.[32] He first married in 1898, but did not discuss it in any of his 
writings.[1] His second marriage was to Fannie Taylor Briggs in January 
1912; he raised her five-year-old daughter from her previous marriage, 
Audrey, as his own daughter.[1] Barrow was an able boxer. He once fought 
John L. Sullivan in an exhibition for four rounds.[4] Barrow was hospitalized 
on July 7, 1953 at the United Hospital of Port Chester, New York and died 
on December 15, at the age of 85, due to a malignancy.[33] His body was 
kept at Campbell's Funeral Home[33] and interred in Kensico Cemetery in 
Valhalla, Westchester County, New York.[1] Barrow was the first executive 
to put numbers on player uniforms.[35] He also announced the retirement 
of Lou Gehrig's uniform number, the first number to be retired.[36] Barrow 
was also the first executive to allow fans to keep foul balls that entered 
the stands.[35] Barrow was also the first to require the playing of "The 
Star-Spangled Banner", the United States' national anthem, before every 
game, not only on holidays.[37] In May 1950, an exhibition game was played 
in honor of Barrow, with Barrow managing a team of retired stars.[38] Barrow 
was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee 
in 1953.[39] On April 15, 1954, the Yankees dedicated a plaque to Barrow, 
which first hung on the center field wall at Yankee Stadium, near the flagpole 
and the monuments to Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Miller Huggins.[40][41]
