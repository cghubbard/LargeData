Dennis Dale "Denny" McLain (born March 29, 1944) is an American former 
professional baseball player.[1] He played as a pitcher in Major League 
Baseball for ten seasons, most notably for the Detroit Tigers. In 1968, 
McLain became the last pitcher in Major League Baseball to win 30 or more 
games during a season (31–6) — a feat accomplished by only eleven players 
in the 20th century.[2][3] McLain was brash and outspoken, sometimes creating 
controversy by criticizing teammates and fans with little provocation.[4] 
His stellar performance at the beginning of his professional baseball career, 
including two Cy Young awards and an American League MVP award, was a marked 
contrast to his personal life, where he became associated with organized 
crime and was eventually convicted on charges of embezzlement and served 
time in prison.[4][5] McLain was born in Markham, Illinois and attended 
Mt. Carmel High School in Chicago, where he played on the baseball team 
as a shortstop and pitcher.[4] As a teenager, he met his future wife, Sharyn 
Boudreau, the daughter of former major league player Lou Boudreau.[5] McLain 
was also musically talented, learning to play the organ from his father.[4] 
Upon his graduation from high school in June 1962, McLain was signed by 
the Chicago White Sox as an amateur free agent and was assigned to play 
with the Harlan Smokies of the Appalachian League.[6] McLain made a spectacular 
debut in professional baseball, throwing a no hitter and striking out 16 
batters in a game against the Salem Rebels on June 28.[4] After just two 
games with the Smokies, he was promoted to the Clinton C-Sox of the Midwest 
League where he posted a record of 4 wins and 7 losses.[6] At the time, 
players with one year of service in the minor leagues were subject to a 
draft if not promoted to the major leagues.[4] The White Sox left McLain 
in the minor leagues and he was selected off waivers by the Detroit Tigers 
on April 8, 1963.[1] He progressed swiftly through the Tigers' minor league 
system and made his major league debut with the Tigers on September 21, 
1963 at the age of 19.[1] His major league debut against the Chicago White 
Sox was almost as impressive as his minor league debut, holding the White 
Sox to one earned run on seven hits.[4] He also picked off two baserunners 
and hit a home run, which would be the only home run of his major league 
career. (McLain is one of just six teenage pitchers to hit a major-league 
home run since 1920, a list that includes Hall-of-Famers Don Drysdale and 
Jim Palmer.)[4] McLain began the 1964 season with the Syracuse Chiefs of 
the International League, but was soon promoted back to the major leagues 
in early June and ended the season with a won-loss record of 4-5.[1] He 
then played for the Mayagüez Indians in the Puerto Rico Baseball League, 
where he posted a 13-2 record and helped the Indians win the league championship.[4] 
He continued to pitch well for the Tigers in the 1965 season. On June 15, 
McLain set a major league record for relief pitchers, when he struck out 
the first seven batters he faced after entering the game in the first inning 
to relieve starting pitcher, Dave Wickersham.[7] He ended the season with 
a 16-6 record, a 2.61 earned run average and 192 strikeouts, the third-highest 
strikeout total in the American League behind Sam McDowell and teammate 
Mickey Lolich.[1][8] Although he had a curveball and a changeup, he relied 
mostly on his fastball to get batters out.[4] In 1966, McLain had a 13-4 
record by mid-season to earn the role of starting pitcher for the American 
League in the 1966 All-Star Game, where he retired all nine batters that 
he faced with just 28 pitches.[9][10] He finished the season with a 20–14 
record with a 3.92 earned run average.[1] In 1967, the Tigers hired former 
major league pitcher Johnny Sain as their pitching coach.[11] Sain helped 
develop McLain's pitching skills and taught him the psychology of pitching.[11][12] 
The 1967 season was memorable due to the tight four-way pennant race between 
the Tigers, the Boston Red Sox, the Minnesota Twins and the Chicago White 
Sox.[4] McLain finished with a 17–16 record and a 3.79 earned run average 
and was winless after August 29.[1][13] On September 18, McLain reported 
that he had severely injured two toes on his left foot, saying that he 
had stubbed them after his foot had fallen asleep.[4] Going into the final 
game of the season against the California Angels, the Tigers needed a victory 
to force a one-game playoff with the Red Sox for the American League pennant.[4] 
McLain pitched ineffectively in the final game and the Tigers lost to finish 
the season one game behind the Red Sox.[14] When the Tigers began the 1968 
season in first place, winning nine consecutive games after losing the 
season opening game, McLain made controversial statements in early May 
by criticizing Detroit fans for being "the biggest front-running fans in 
the world."[15][16] He continued to win games at a remarkable pace, registering 
his 29th victory on September 10.[17] On September 13, he appeared on the 
cover of Time magazine.[18][19] On September 14, at Tiger Stadium in front 
of a nationally televised audience, McLain pitched the Tigers to a 5-4 
victory over the Oakland Athletics to become Major League Baseball's first 
30-game winner since 1934.[20] Dizzy Dean, the previous 30-game winner, 
was on hand to congratulate him.[20] After the Tigers had clinched the 
1968 American League pennant, McLain added to his penchant for notoriety 
while pitching in his 31st victory in a game against the New York Yankees 
on September 19.[4] McLain had grown up idolizing New York Yankee center 
fielder, Mickey Mantle, who entered the game tied with Jimmie Foxx for 
third place in the major league career home runs list.[21] When Mantle 
came to bat in the eighth inning with McLain and the Tigers holding a 6-1 
lead, McLain intentionally threw a soft pitch directly over home plate.[21] 
Other accounts say that he called catcher Jim Price to the mound and had 
him tell Mantle that he would be throwing only fastballs.[22] Mantle hit 
the pitch for his 535th career home run, putting him in sole possession 
of third place on the all-time home run list, behind only Babe Ruth and 
Willie Mays. As Mantle ran around the bases, McLain stood on the pitcher's 
mound and applauded.[5] Mantle tipped his hat to McLain as he rounded the 
bases.[22] The next batter, Joe Pepitone, waved his bat over the plate, 
as if asking for an easy pitch of his own. McLain responded by throwing 
the next pitch over Pepitone's head.[23] After the game, McLain smilingly 
denied that he had served up an easy pitch for Mantle to hit, however, 
he was later reprimanded by Major League Baseball Commissioner William 
Eckert.[4][21] McLain produced a 31–6 record along with a 1.96 earned run 
average, as the Tigers led from start to finish to win the American League 
pennant.[1][24] McLain also earned his second All-Star berth and won the 
1968 American League Cy Young Award as well as the American League Most 
Valuable Player Award, the first by an American League pitcher since Bobby 
Shantz in 1952 and the first by a Tiger since fellow pitcher Hal Newhouser's 
back-to-back honors in 1944 and 1945.[25][26][27] He was the first pitcher 
in the history of the American League to win the Most Valuable Player Award 
and the Cy Young Award in the same season.[28] St. Louis Cardinal Bob Gibson 
would win the National League's Most Valuable Player Award that same year, 
making 1968 the only season to date in which a pitcher won the MVP Award 
in both leagues. McLain's performance in the Tigers' 1968 World Series 
triumph over the Cardinals was not as impressive as his regular season.[29] 
Having already pitched 336 innings and 28 complete games during the regular 
season, a sore-armed McLain lost twice to Gibson (including a still-standing 
World Series record 17-strikeout performance in the opener) to help put 
the Tigers down three games to one. Trailing three games to two, McLain 
won the crucial Game 6 on just two days' rest, aided by a grand slam home 
run from Jim Northrup.[30] Teammate Mickey Lolich won three games during 
the series, including a complete game triumph in Game 7 against Gibson, 
and won the World Series MVP award.[31] After the season, when McLain was 
asked about Lolich's performance in the World Series, he responded controversially 
by saying: "I wouldn't trade one Bob Gibson for 12 Mickey Loliches."[4] 
The season became known as the year of the pitcher, with batting averages 
and run production dropping in both the American and National Leagues.[12] 
After the record home run year by Roger Maris in 1961, the major leagues 
increased the size of the strike zone from the top of the batter's shoulders 
to the bottom of the knees.[32] Pitchers such as McLain and Gibson among 
others dominated hitters, producing 339 shutouts in 1968.[12] Carl Yastrzemski 
would be the only American League hitter to finish the season with a batting 
average higher than .300.[12] In the National League, Gibson posted a 1.12 
earned run average, the lowest in 54 years while, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher 
Don Drysdale threw a record 58 and two-thirds consecutive scoreless innings 
during the 1968 season.[12] As a result of the dropping offensive statistics, 
Major League Baseball took steps to reduce the advantage held by pitchers 
by lowering the height of the pitcher's mound from 15 inches to 10 inches, 
and by reducing the size of the strike zone for the 1969 season.[33] McLain's 
success on the playing field allowed him to receive endorsements from the 
Hammond Organ Company and to make musical appearances in Las Vegas.[34] 
He was invited to appear with his musical quartet on The Ed Sullivan Show 
along with his World Series opponent (and guitarist) Bob Gibson.[35] McLain 
also made appearances on The Steve Allen Show and the The Joey Bishop Show.[36] 
He would go on to release two albums on Capitol Records, Denny McLain at 
the Organ (1968) and Denny McLain in Las Vegas (1969).[37] In January 1969, 
McLain was selected as the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year.[38] 
He created more disruption when he was named as the starting pitcher for 
the American League in the 1969 All-Star Game in Washington, D.C., but 
missed the start of the game because of a dental appointment in Detroit. 
The appointment was scheduled for Wednesday the 23rd, the day after the 
All-Star game, but because of a rainout on the scheduled date, the game 
was played on the 23rd.[39] McLain was a non-conformist and liked to play 
by his own rules.[4] He had purchased an airplane and learned to fly.[4] 
Having kept his dental appointment, he then flew himself to Washington, 
arriving at the game during the second inning.[39] He pitched in the fourth 
inning, but by then the National League had already built a 9-2 lead.[40] 
McLain created more dissension when he clashed with Tigers' manager Mayo 
Smith over the latter's role in the firing of Johnny Sain as the team's 
pitching coach.[2] Despite the troubles, McLain had another productive 
season in 1969, winning 24 games and a second consecutive Cy Young Award, 
tying with Baltimore's Mike Cuellar, marking the first time two players 
had shared the award.[1][41] It would be the last award of his major league 
career.[1] In February 1970, Sports Illustrated and Penthouse magazines 
both published articles about McLain's involvement in bookmaking activities. 
Sports Illustrated cited sources who alleged that the foot injury suffered 
by McLain late in 1967 had been caused by an organized crime figure stomping 
on it for McLain's failure to pay off on a bet.[2] Early in his career, 
McLain's interest in betting on horses was piqued by Chuck Dressen, one 
of his first managers.[2] McLain's descent into his gambling obsession 
was further precipitated by an offhand remark made during an interview: 
that he drank about a case of Pepsi a day. (When he pitched, he was known 
to drink a Pepsi between innings.) A representative from Pepsi then offered 
McLain a contract with the company, just for doing a few endorsements. 
McLain soon realized that he and the Pepsi rep shared an affinity for gambling; 
when the two realized how much money they were losing, and that they could 
earn so much more by "taking the action" on bets, they attempted to set 
up a bookmaking operation as hands-off, silent partners. McLain was suspended 
indefinitely by Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn; the suspension was then 
set for the first three months of the 1970 season.[42] He returned in mid-season, 
but struggled to pitch well.[4] McLain then received a seven-day suspension 
(from the Detroit club) in September for dousing two sportswriters (Jim 
Hawkins of the Detroit Free Press and Watson Spoelstra of the Detroit News) 
with buckets of water.[4] Just as the seven-day suspension was about to 
end, he received another suspension from Kuhn, this time for carrying a 
gun on a team flight, for at least the rest of the season.[4] McLain's 
1970 season ended with a won-lost record of only 3–5.[1] Later that year, 
despite being the first $100,000 player in Tigers history, he was forced 
into bankruptcy.[4] Meanwhile, co-scheming to make more money, McLain's 
friend Jim Northrup was back in Detroit furthering a plan they shared to 
generate a nude baseball model calendar. (Efforts would eventually fall 
short.) On October 9, 1970, McLain was traded by the Detroit Tigers with 
Elliott Maddox, Norm McRae and Don Wert to the Washington Senators for 
Joe Coleman, Eddie Brinkman, Jim Hannan and Aurelio Rodríguez.[43] Kuhn 
actually had to clear the trade because McLain was still under suspension, 
and suspended players can't be traded without the commissioner's permission. 
Kuhn later wrote in his autobiography, Hardball: The Education of a Baseball 
Commissioner, that he was shocked at what he called a "foolish gamble" 
by the Senators, and predicted that the trade would turn out to be a Tiger 
heist. The McLain trade was made over the strenuous objections of Senators 
manager Ted Williams, who had little patience for McLain's high living.[44] 
The feeling was mutual; early in the 1971 season he became a charter member 
of the "Underminers' Club", a group of five players dedicated to getting 
Williams fired. They spent much of the season feuding over Williams' use 
of a then-unusual five-man rotation for his starters. Senators broadcaster 
Shelby Whitfield later told Rob Neyer that when Williams yanked McLain 
early from a July 5 game against the Cleveland Indians, McLain threatened 
to call Senators owner Bob Short and have him get rid of Williams.[45] 
By this time, McLain had serious arm trouble, inadvertently made worse 
by numerous cortisone shots he took for his sore arm.[44] As a result, 
he essentially stopped throwing fastballs midway through the 1971 season.[45] 
Due to his arm troubles and his inability to get along with Williams, McLain 
went 10–22.[1] He thus earned the dubious distinction of going from leading 
his league in wins (tied with Mike Cuellar with 24 wins in 1969) to two 
years later leading his league in losses.[2] McLain's 22 defeats (a mark 
later tied by three pitchers, all in 1974) remains the most in a major 
league season since Jack Fisher of the Mets lost 24 in 1965. After the 
1971 season, McLain was traded to the Oakland Athletics for journeyman 
pitcher Jim Panther and prospect Don Stanhouse (who would go on to have 
a few good years as the Baltimore Orioles' closer in the late 1970s).[45] 
After only five starts, one win and a 6.04 ERA, the Athletics traded him 
to the Atlanta Braves for Orlando Cepeda;[46] he went only 3–5 for Atlanta, 
and his overall totals for 1972 were 4–7 with a 6.37 ERA.[1] His final 
major league appearance came on September 12 against the Cincinnati Reds; 
he came into a tied game in the ninth and promptly gave up three runs without 
retiring a batter, taking the loss (coincidentally, the last batter McLain 
ever faced in the major leagues was none other than Pete Rose, who would 
also be ensnared in a gambling scandal years later).[1] The Braves released 
McLain during spring training, on March 26, 1973.[47] After short stints 
with minor league clubs in Des Moines and Shreveport, McLain retired.[6] 
At the age of 29, he was out of baseball.[4] In a 10-year major league 
career, McLain won 131 games against 91 losses.[1] His career earned run 
average was 3.39 and he recorded 1,282 strikeouts in 1,886 innings pitched.[1] 
McLain was a three-time All-Star and won the Cy Young Award twice in his 
career.[1] Because he relied so much on his fastball, he also surrendered 
numerous home runs, leading the American League in home runs allowed in 
three consecutive years (1966–1968).[1][36] Since McLain's 31-win season, 
only two other pitchers have approached the 30-game milestone (Steve Carlton 
won 27 games in 1972 and Bob Welch also with 27 victories in 1990).[48] 
With Major League Baseball moving from the four-man pitching rotation of 
McLain's era to five-man rotations, and with the increased reliance on 
relief pitchers, some observers believe that there may not be another 30-game 
winner as the game is played today.[12][48] In 1974, McLain played a season 
for the London Majors of the Intercounty Baseball League at Labatt Memorial 
Park in London, Ontario, Canada. Given his arm problems, McLain only pitched 
nine innings for the Majors, but he did play in 14 games at either shortstop, 
first base or catcher and batted .380, including hitting two homers in 
one game in London. McLain continued to earn side money playing the organ 
at clubs, including a club in suburban Detroit with former heavyweight 
boxing champion Leon Spinks working as a bartender.[49] McLain also earned 
quite a bit of money hustling golf, easily attracting 'marks' due to his 
past baseball fame.[4] Additionally, he reportedly once accepted over $160,000 
to fly a wanted felon out of the country.[4] In his post-baseball career, 
his weight ballooned to 330 pounds (150 kg).[2] He was imprisoned for drug 
trafficking (cocaine), embezzlement, and racketeering with Anthony Spilotro 
and later John Gotti Jr. Attorney Lawrence R. Greene represented McLain 
before the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Atlanta, 
where his conviction under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations 
Act (RICO) in the United States District Court for the Middle District 
of Florida in Tampa was reversed.[2] Between his stints in prison and rehabilitation 
in the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, McLain could be found on various sports 
shows on talk radio and occasionally on panel-format sports shows on network 
television in the Detroit area, as well as modeling "Hanes" underwear.[50] 
He could also be found signing autographs at a metro Detroit 7-Eleven store 
at the corner of Mound Road and Metro Parkway in Sterling Heights, Michigan, 
where he was employed on work-release.[2] He also hosted a popular daily 
talk radio show for a few years after his release on Detroit talk station 
WXYT. McLain's oldest daughter, Kristin, 26, was killed on March 20, 1992 
in a car accident caused by a drunk driver.[4] She had been living in Florida 
and was moving back home to Michigan when she was killed just a few miles 
from her parents' home.[51] In part to escape his grief, McLain and several 
partners bought the Peet Packing Company (Farmer Peet's) located in the 
small town of Chesaning, Michigan in 1994.[citation needed] McLain was 
also a partner in the Michigan Radio Network.[citation needed] Both companies 
went bankrupt two years later.[citation needed] In 1996, he was convicted 
on charges of embezzlement, mail fraud, and conspiracy in connection with 
the theft of $2.5 million from the Peet employees' pension fund.[5] McLain 
spent six years in prison; to this day he insists he knew nothing about 
the shady financial deals alleged by the government. McLain claims he paid 
restitution for this incident.[52] During the Detroit Tigers 2006 playoff 
run, McLain was the baseball analyst for Drew and Mike on WRIF radio in 
Detroit. In 2007, McLain released his autobiography I Told You I Wasn't 
Perfect, co-authored by longtime Detroit sportscaster and author Eli Zaret. 
Prior to that, McLain and Zaret hosted a sports television show together 
in Detroit. McLain currently resides in Pinckney, Michigan, with his wife, 
Sharyn. Sharyn had divorced Denny during the latter's most recent incarceration, 
but remarried him upon his release. McLain writes a monthly editorial column 
and blogs regularly for * In Play! Magazine, a Detroit sports magazine. 
Kevin Costner's character in the motion picture The Upside of Anger was 
partly based on McLain (and also partly on Kirk Gibson, another Tiger of 
World Series note).[53] On April 11, 2008, McLain was arrested without 
incident after deputies discovered an outstanding warrant against him for 
failing to appear for a January 16 court hearing.[54] On September 22, 
2011, McLain was arrested in Port Huron, Michigan at the Canada–US border 
after officials discovered an outstanding warrant against him from St. 
Charles Parish, Louisiana. Because of construction detours, McLain had 
inadvertently taken an exit off I-94 that sent him directly across the 
Bluewater Bridge and into Canada. He immediately returned to the U.S. where 
he was obligated to go through a U.S. Custom and Border Protection inspection 
booth. The outstanding warrant was discovered and McLain was jailed in 
Port Huron, Michigan. In less than a week, the warrant was cleared and
