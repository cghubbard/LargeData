Evan David Meek (born May 12, 1983) is an American professional baseball 
relief pitcher for the Lancaster Barnstormers of the Atlantic League of 
Professional Baseball. He has played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Baltimore 
Orioles in Major League Baseball (MLB) and was selected to one All-Star 
Game. Meek attended Inglemoor High School in Kenmore, Washington. Afterwards 
he played for Midland College in Midland, Texas. Then he transferred at 
semester to play at Bellevue Community College also in Washington.[1] After 
being selected by the Minnesota Twins in the 2002 Major League Baseball 
draft, Meek began playing for the Twins affiliate in the Appalachian League, 
the Elizabethton Twins. In 2004, Meek played for Elizabethton and the Quad 
Cities River Bandits. Meek started the 2005 season with the Beloit Snappers. 
Meek was released by the Twins in June 2005. Meek signed with the San Diego 
Padres in September 2005. He started the 2006 season with the Lake Elsinore 
Storm. In August 2006, Meek and a player to be named later, (Dale Thayer), 
were traded to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for Russell Branyan.[2] Meek finished 
the 2006 season with the Visalia Oaks. He pitched the 2007 season for the 
Montgomery Biscuits. In the 2007 Rule 5 draft, Meek was selected from the 
Devil Rays by the Pittsburgh Pirates. This required that Meek remain on 
the active roster of the Pirates for the entire 2008 season or else the 
Pirates would have to offer him back to the Devil Rays for half the amount 
they paid to acquire him.[3] Meek made his major league debut on April 
2, 2008 with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He would record his first career loss 
in extra innings against the Chicago Cubs on April 7, 2008. Meek made nine 
relief appearances, going 0–1 with a 6.92 ERA, before being designated 
for assignment on May 4, 2008. He was offered back per Rule 5 guidelines 
on May 14. The Pirates paid cash to keep him and sent him down to their 
minor league teams. After pitching 9 games with the Double-A Altoona Curve, 
Meek was promoted to the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. Meek spent the 
2009 season in the bullpen with the Pirates. He finished the season with 
a 1–1 record in 41 appearances, had a 3.45 ERA, gave up 2 home runs, 0 
hit batsmen, 29 walks, 42 strikeouts, a .209 average against, and a 1.34 
WHIP, in 47.0 innings pitched. The 2010 season was Meek's first full season 
in the Majors. He was often asked by manager John Russell to pitch multiple 
innings in relief. Meek's performance rivaled other excellent closers like 
Joakim Soria and Brian Wilson despite not being one himself.[4] Early in 
the season when Dotel had given up runs in six straight games as the closer, 
Meek had an opportunity in the role and earned his first Major League save 
on April 29, 2010 to close out a 2–0 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers.[5] 
On May 14, 2010 against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, Meek entered 
the game in the 6th inning with the score tied 6–6, and he pitched two 
scoreless innings of relief, striking out four of the seven Cubs hitters 
he faced including Derrek Lee, Xavier Nady and Alfonso Soriano in the bottom 
of the 7th. The Pirates rallied behind his strong pitching to win the game 
10–6.[6] Meek delivered one of his finest performances of the season against 
the Washington Nationals on June 10, 2010, coming in to relieve Pirates 
starter Zach Duke with the bases loaded and no outs. He quickly forced 
Willie Harris to line into a double play before retiring Cristian Guzmán, 
needing only six pitches to get out of the inning with no runs in.[7] Due 
to his excellent work, he was named to the 2010 MLB All Star Game. At the 
time of his selection on July 4, 2010, Meek carried a 4–2 record with a 
0.96 ERA, a mark that lead all National League relievers. "It's surprising", 
Meek said. "A lot of starters and closers go to the game. I've always said 
there are a lot of great middle relievers out there who deserve to go to 
the game. I think they're overlooked a little bit. It's amazing to be selected, 
an overwhelming feeling."[8] Meek was the first Pirate reliever selected 
who was not a closer since Mace Brown in 1938 – before the closer position 
emerged. The Pirates celebrated his nomination at PNC Park with an 8–5 
victory over the visiting Philadelphia Phillies, a game where Meek was 
the winning pitcher.[9] On August 3, 2010, Meek recorded his first career 
base hit, off fellow reliever Jordan Smith of the Cincinnati Reds. Meek 
finished the 2010 season with a 2.14 ERA, 70 strikeouts, 4 saves, 15 holds, 
and a 5–4 record, all career-highs. After several injuries in 2011, Meek 
saw a decrease in fastball velocity.[10] Meek started the 2012 season with 
Pittsburgh, but on May 1, Meek was optioned to Triple-A Indianapolis. Meek 
was 0-0 with a 5.59 ERA in 9 games with a .293 opposing batting average. 
He was recalled to the Pirates on July 21, 2012, after an injury to reliever 
Juan Cruz. But was sent back down on July 26, to make room for highly anticipated 
prospect Starling Marté. Meek was designated for assignment by the Pirates 
on September 10, 2012.[11] In October 2012, Meek elected minor league free 
agency.[12] Meek spent the 2013 season in the Texas Rangers organization 
with the Triple-A Round Rock Express. Meek signed a minor league deal with 
the Baltimore Orioles in February 2014.[13] After a strong spring training, 
he made the Opening Day roster. On May 2, he was optioned to the Triple-A 
Norfolk Tides. He was recalled on May 15, and then designated for assignment 
on May 16.[14] Instead, the next day Meek was optioned back to Norfolk. 
On May 28, he was assigned outright to Norfolk.[15] On September 25, 2014, 
Meek gave up a walk-off single to New York Yankees all-star Derek Jeter 
in Jeter's final game at Yankee Stadium. Meek signed a minor league contract 
with the Washington Nationals on January 21, 2015.[16] On July 20, 2015, 
the Kia Tigers of the Korea Baseball Organization announced that they had 
signed Meek to a one-year deal worth $150,000. Meek filled a roster vacancy 
created by the club's release of former MLB pitcher Philip Humber on the 
same day.[17] On May 5, 2016, Meek signed with the Somerset Patriots of 
the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He was released on July 20, 
2016. On July 26, 2016, Meek signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of 
the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. Meek's four-seam fastball 
normally sits around 95 mph, although he is capable of reaching 97–98 mph 
on occasion. It is his primary pitch, throwing it slightly over half the 
time. Despite missing the final two months of the 2009 Major League Baseball 
season, he added 8 pounds of muscle during the off-season and promised 
that he would be able to hit 100 mph in 2010.[18] Since his command has 
improved throughout his career – 5.55 walks per 9 innings in 2009 to around 
2.10 in 2010 – opposing batters have shown more willingness to chase the 
pitch, even out of the strike zone to due his ability throw his other pitches 
for strikes. However, after several injuries in 2011, Meek saw his fastball 
velocity decrease into the low to mid 90s, ranging from 90-95 mph.[10] 
Meek's curveball is his primary off-speed pitch, with the velocity sitting 
around 79–82 mph. Meek throws a cutter that was rated in August 2009 as 
the 3rd most effective cutter in Major League Baseball because of its runs 
above the MLB average.[19] The pitch has "unfair biting" movement, even 
against left-handed batters, according to Dejan Kovacevic of the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette. Average velocity is 92–93 mph and he normally likes to use 
it when he gets ahead in a count as a strikeout pitch. It is normally a 
very difficult pitch to hit well, helping him limit the number of extra 
base hits he allows. Meek also throws a fourth pitch, an off-speed slider 
that is seldom used in pressure situations. The pitch normally sits around 
80–82 mph, mainly incorporated to keep hitters out of a rhythm. His ability 
to throw four pitches well however, makes him rare as a relief pitcher
