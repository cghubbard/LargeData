The Senior League World Series is a baseball tournament for children aged 
13 to 16 years old that began in 1961.[1] Since 2002, the tournament has 
been held annually in Bangor, Maine. It is patterned after the Little League 
World Series, which was named for the World Series in Major League Baseball 
since 2002. The Senior League World Series is one of nine tournaments sponsored 
by Little League International. Each of them brings baseball or softball 
teams from around the world together in one of four age divisions. The 
tournament structure for each division's World Series is similar to that 
used for the Little League Baseball World Series. The Senior League World 
Series has been held at four different sites.[2] Unlike the Little League 
World Series — which has sixteen regions (eight in the U.S. and eight international) 
— the Senior League World Series has only ten regions. The Senior League

to boost attendance. Because of the mixed pools, it does not have international 
and United States champions. The six United States regions are: The four

the semi-finals. The semi-final winners play for the championship, televised 
on a network of ESPN. All semi-final and championship matches are single-elimination 
games. From 2002-2014, a pool play format was used. Beginning in 2015, 
each pool will play a modified double-elimination format until only 2 teams 
remain in each pool. The two remaining teams in their respective pools 
will play in a single elimination semi-final match, with the two winning 
teams playing in the championship. Prior to 2002 the tournament was straight 
double-elimination. From 1990-2001 a placement bracket was used to determine
