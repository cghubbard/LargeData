Ellsworth Tenney "Babe" Dahlgren (June 15, 1912 – September 4, 1996) was 
a Major League Baseball infielder from 1935 to 1946 for the Boston Red 
Sox, New York Yankees, Boston Braves, Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Browns, Brooklyn 
Dodgers, Philadelphia Phillies, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Dahlgren replaced 
Lou Gehrig in the line up on May 2, 1939, ending Gehrig's 14-year, 2,130 
consecutive game streak. Dahlgren had a homer and double‚ as the Yankees 
routed Detroit 22-2. He went on to hit 15 home runs and drive in 89 runs 
for the season for the Yankees.[1] Late in the 1940 season, Dahlgren mishandled 
a throw from Frank Crosetti in a critical game against the Cleveland Indians. 
The Yankees lost that game, and with it any realistic chance at a fifth 
straight pennant. Manager Joe McCarthy believed that Dahlgren's error was 
what ultimately cost the Yankees the pennant. He suggested that Dahlgren 
was smoking marijuana, and that it dulled his reflexes enough to keep him 
from handling the throw cleanly.[2] After discovering the existence of 
the rumor in 1943, Dahlgren became the first Major League Baseball player 
to take a drug test for a non-performance-enhancing drug. He did so voluntarily 
to discredit the rumors circulating at the time. The tests were all negative, 
refuting the charges of marijuana use. Dahlgren continued to play at the 
major league level until 1946, in a playing career which spanned 18 years, 
including all or part of twelve seasons in the majors. Dahlgren spent decades 
trying to uncover the source of the rumor.[3] In 2007 a hypothesis as to 
who was the perpetrator of the rumor was brought forth by his grandson, 
Matt Dahlgren, in his self-published book, Rumor in Town. Also notable 
during this period, the Browns returned Dahlgren to the Cubs for a contract 
dispute once it was learned that he had become eligible for the draft in 
May 1942.[4] He was sold to the Dodgers soon after. In August 1942 he sought 
voluntary retirement.[5] In early 1943, Dahlgren was notified by the draft 
board to report for his physical, which occurred in mid-May of that year.[6] 
After passing his physical, Dahlgren was to be inducted into the military 
in July 1943.[7] In July 1943, he played on the National League All-star 
team. In October 1943, Dahlgren was rejected for military service due to
