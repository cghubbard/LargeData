Royce Middlebrook "Ross" Youngs (April 10, 1897 – October 22, 1927) was 
an American professional baseball player. Nicknamed "Pep", he played ten 
seasons in Major League Baseball for the New York Giants from 1917 through 
1926, playing right field almost exclusively. Youngs was a part of the 
Giants teams that won four consecutive National League pennants and the 
1921 and 1922 World Series. From Shiner, Texas, Youngs excelled at baseball 
and American football at the West Texas Military Institute. After beginning 
his professional career in minor league baseball, the Giants signed him 
in 1916. Youngs had a lifetime .322 batting average with the Giants and 
batted over .300 nine times in his career, including eight consecutive 
seasons. His career was cut short by illness, however, as he died at the 
age of 30 of Bright's disease. Youngs was elected to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 1972 by the Veterans Committee. His election was not without 
controversy, however, as the Veterans Committee consisted of his former 
teammates, and charges of cronyism were leveled against the committee. 
Youngs was born in Shiner, Texas, the second of three children, all sons.[1] 
His father was a railroad worker,[2] but suffered disability and moved 
his family to San Antonio where he worked as a rancher. Youngs' mother 
ran a small hotel in San Antonio and Youngs had a paper route.[1] Youngs 
was educated at West Texas Military Institute.[1] He received offers for 
scholarships to play college football but passed on these, as he preferred 
baseball.[1] He made his professional baseball debut for the Austin Senators 
of the Texas League in 1914. Appearing in 17 games, he hit just .145 for 
the class-B Senators and, in 1915, found himself down in the Class-D leagues, 
playing for Brenham of the Middle Texas League and the Waxahachie Athletics 
of the Central Texas League; both leagues disbanded during the season.[1] 
In 1916, playing in the infield for the Sherman Lions of the Class-D Western 
Association, he hit .362 as a switch-hitter, drawing the attention of the 
New York Giants, who purchased his contract in August for $2,000 ($43,566 
in current dollar terms).[1] Youngs reported to spring training in Marlin, 
Texas with the Giants in 1917. They initially assigned him to the Rochester 
Hustlers, a team in the International League with which the Giants had 
a working relationship. Giants manager John McGraw told Mickey Doolan, 
the manager of the Hustlers, "I'm giving you one of the greatest players 
I've ever seen. Play him in the outfield. If anything happens to him, I'm 
holding you responsible."[1] In 140 games with Rochester, Youngs hit .356, 
earning himself a late-season promotion to the big league club.[1] McGraw 
gave Youngs the nickname "Pep" due to his hustle[3] and soon began to groom 
Youngs to become his successor as Giants' manager.[1] Youngs made his major 
league debut on September 25 and played in seven of the last nine games 
of the season for the eventual National League (NL) pennant-winners: six 
in center field and one in right. In those seven games he went 9-for-26 
(.346) with two doubles and three triples.[1] In 1918 regular Giants right 
fielder Dave Robertson left the team to manage a local military ballclub,[4] 
and Youngs was given the full-time job out of spring training. Batting 
exclusively left-handed, Youngs responded by batting .302 in 121 games, 
finishing sixth in the league.[1][5] It would be the first of seven straight 
seasons in which he hit .300 as a regular, and the second of eight overall 
counting his brief stint in 1917. He also finished sixth in the NL with 
a .368 on-base percentage (OBP).[5] The next season Robertson was traded 
to the Chicago Cubs for pitcher Phil Douglas, leaving Youngs to become 
a fixture in right field for the Giants.[6] Youngs finished third in the 
NL in 1919 with a .311 batting average.[7] His .351 batting average in 
1920 was second in the NL to Rogers Hornsby.[8] Youngs batted .327 in 1921, 
good for ninth in the NL.[9] In Game 3 of the 1921 World Series Youngs 
became the first player to record two hits in the same inning of a World 
Series game. The Giants defeated the New York Yankees[1] as Youngs batted 
.280 in the series.[10] Youngs hit for the cycle on April 29, 1922.[11] 
He finished the regular season ninth in the NL in OBP (.398) and tied for 
ninth in stolen bases (17),[12] proceeding to hit .375 in the 1922 World 
Series as the Giants again defeated the Yankees.[1] Youngs led the NL in 
runs scored in 1923, with 121, and his .348 batting average was the eighth 
best in the league.[13] Youngs batted .356 in the 1923 World Series, which 
the Giants lost to the Yankees.[10] Youngs batted .356 during the 1924 
season, finishing third in the NL.[14] In the final series of this season, 
the Giants were playing the Philadelphia Phillies at the Polo Grounds and 
battling for the pennant with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Jimmy O'Connell, an 
outfielder for the Giants, offered Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand $500 
to intentionally lose the games ($6,916 in current dollar terms). Sand 
rejected the bribe and reported it to Phillies manager Art Fletcher. It 
eventually led to the lifetime suspension of O'Connell and Giants coach 
Crazy Dolan by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. O'Connell implicated 
teammates Youngs, George Kelly, and Frankie Frisch as co-conspirators;[15] 
Landis, however, cleared the trio of any wrongdoing.[16] Youngs slumped 
to a .185 batting average during the 1924 World Series, which the Giants 
lost to the Washington Senators.[17] Continuing to struggle in 1925, Youngs 
batted .264, his only season with a batting average below .300,[1] but 
improved to .306 in 95 games during the 1926 season.[1] Toward the end 
of his career, Youngs taught Mel Ott, his eventual successor, how to play 
right field in the Polo Grounds.[1] Youngs's career was abruptly cut short 
in 1926 when he was diagnosed with the kidney disorder that, at the time, 
was called Bright's disease. He had been exposed to streptococcal infection 
in 1924.[18] Too ill to play after August 10, 1926, Youngs returned home 
on McGraw's insistence[1][3] and received a blood transfusion in March 
1927.[19] Youngs died of Bright's disease on October 22, 1927 at the age 
of 30. He went from weighing 170 pounds (77 kg) during his playing career 
to 100 pounds (45 kg) by the time of his death.[1] In Youngs' obituary 
in The New York Times, Giants manager John McGraw called Youngs "the greatest 
outfielder I ever saw on a ball field."[3] The Giants honored Youngs with 
a bronze plaque on the right field wall of the Polo Grounds;[20] although 
the Giants intended to pay for it, fans expressed their desire to contribute 
and, even though contributions were limited to $1 per person, donations 
paid for the plaque entirely.[1] Over his ten-year career, Youngs posted 
812 runs, 42 home runs, 592 runs batted in (RBI), 153 stolen bases, a .322 
career batting average, and .399 career on-base percentage. He batted .300 
or higher in every season until 1925, and higher than .350 twice. Youngs 
scored 100 or more runs three times and posted a career high 102 RBI in 
1921 and 10 home runs in 1924. During his tenure with the team, the Giants 
went to the World Series four consecutive years (1921–1924) and won twice 
(1921, 1922). Youngs was a favorite of McGraw, who kept only two pictures 
in his office: one of Christy Mathewson and one of Youngs.[1] Rosy Ryan, 
a teammate with the Giants, and Burleigh Grimes, who played against Youngs 
as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers, considered Youngs the best player 
they ever saw.[21] Youngs was included in the inaugural balloting for the 
National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936, but received less than 5% of the 
vote from the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Youngs 
remained on the ballot every year through 1956, receiving his highest vote 
total in 1947 with 22%.[22] Ford C. Frick, Commissioner of Baseball, and 
former teammate Bill Terry both championed Youngs' candidacy.[1] Former 
Giants teammates Terry and Frankie Frisch joined the Veterans Committee 
in 1967 and aided the elections of several of their former teammates, including 
Youngs in 1972.[23] In addition to Youngs, Terry and Frisch shepherded 
the selections of Giants teammates Jesse Haines in 1970, Dave Bancroft 
and Chick Hafey in 1971, George Kelly in 1973, Jim Bottomley in 1974, and 
Freddie Lindstrom in 1976.[22][24] Youngs died at the earliest age of any 
current Hall of Famer.[25] Youngs is the only member of the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame from San Antonio and was inducted into the San Antonio Sports 
Hall of Fame in 1998.[26] Shiner, the town in which Youngs was born, hosted 
a baseball tournament in his honor at Clipper Field from 2001 through 2003.[2][27] 
Youngs' selection, along with some of the other selections made by Terry 
and Frisch, has been considered one of the weakest in some circles.[28] 
According to the BBWAA, the Veterans Committee was not selective enough 
in choosing members,[29] and charges of cronyism were later leveled against 
the committee.[30] This led to the Veterans Committee having its powers 
reduced in subsequent years.[31] Baseball statistician Bill James recognized 
this and wrote that Youngs does not belong in the Hall of Fame.[32] In 
1981, however, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Youngs in their 
book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. They explained what 
they called "the Smoky Joe Wood Syndrome", where a player of truly exceptional 
talent but a career curtailed by injury or illness should still — in spite 
of not owning career statistics that would quantitatively rank him with 
the all-time greats — be included on their list of the 100 greatest players.[33] 
Youngs married Dorothy Pienecke, a woman from Brooklyn who he met while 
vacationing in the Berkshires, in October 1924. Their daughter Caroline 
was born in December 1925.[1] Dorothy feuded with Youngs' mother, however, 
and the couple separated before the birth of Caroline, whom he never met.[1] 
Youngs was considered friendly and generous, loaned money constantly, and 
was reportedly owed $16,000 at the time of his death ($218,330 in current 
dollar terms).[1] Youngs enjoyed playing golf and was considered the best
