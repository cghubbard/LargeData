Madison Avenue Grounds was a baseball ground located in Baltimore, Maryland. 
It was built by the Waverly Club as the first enclosed ballpark in Baltimore, 
with spectator seating and player clubhouses, and was the site of the first 
intercity game played in Baltimore (Brooklyn Excelsiors 51, Baltimore Excelsiors 
6) on September 22, 1860;[1] it was the site of a 47-7 defeat of the local 
Marylands by the undefeated Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1869,[2] and it 
was used by the Washington Olympics for a professional game in 1871.[3] 
On August 16, 1870, it was the site of an intercity game between black 
teams.[4] The ballpark was home to the Maryland club of the National Association, 
who had a brief fling as a professional club in 1873. Retrosheet differs 
from Michael Benson's Baseball Parks of North America, in that Benson states 
the Maryland club lasted until July 11 at the ballpark. Retrosheet indicates 
that only one game was played there and that the July 11 game was at Newington 
Park, the home of the relatively established Lord Baltimore club. The Maryland 
club, in fact, played only six games as professionals: the first two against 
Washington, and the last four against their intra-city rivals.[5] The park 
was also reportedly the home to Baltimore's Union Association entry in 
1884, again for only one game as the club owners decided the grounds were 
unfit for use. However, Retrosheet indicates all home games were at the 
club's Belair Lot field.[6] James H. Bready, in his book The Home Team, 
a history of the Baltimore baseball clubs, places the location (based on 
old maps) on a block roughly bounded by what is now Madison Avenue (southwest); 
Boundary Avenue (later North Avenue) (north); Linden Avenue (northeast); 
and an old, unnamed road (southeast). The location has also been given 
as "the end of Eutaw Street near the corner of Madison Avenue and North
