Jessica Ofelia Mendoza (born November 11, 1980) is an American former softball 
player and current broadcaster. At Stanford University, Mendoza was a four-time 
First Team All-American for the Stanford Cardinal from 1999 to 2002, as 
well as a member of the United States women's national softball team from 
2004 to 2010. She played professionally in National Pro Fastpitch. Mendoza 
owns numerous Cardinal records.[1][2][3] She is currently a member of the 
broadcast team for ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball.[4] Mendoza, a graduate 
of Adolfo Camarillo High School, was named the Los Angeles Times "Player 
of the Year" in 1998. During her junior and senior years, she was named 
Camarillo High School "Female Athlete of the Year." Mendoza was also a 
member of the high school basketball team and was the team MVP in both 
her junior and senior years.[5] Mendoza began her career as a 1999 First 
Team All-American and All-Pac-10 honoree. Included with her recognition, 
she was named conference "Newcomer of The Year." She broke the Cardinal 
records for season batting average and RBI totals while ranking top-10 
for her hits.[5] On March 6, 1999 in defeating Illinois State, Mendoza 
hit a single game career high 4 hits off pitchers Corey Harris, Tammy Millian 
and Jamie Bagnall.[6] Later that month, for the week of March 8, she was 
named National Fastpitch Coaches Association "Player of The Week" after 
hitting .631 (12/19) with 11 RBIs, 4 home runs, a triple and two doubles 
for a slugging percentage of 1.473.[7] The sophomore's season saw her again 
earn First Team citations for the NCAA Division I and the Pac-10.[8] She 
added conference "Player of The Year" to her collection and broke her own 
record for batting average with a then school and career best .474 statistic, 
which also led the NCAA.[9] She also claimed new records for hits, home 
runs, doubles, slugging and stolen bases, which all still rank top-10 for 
a season at Stanford.[10] From February 29 through March 22, 2000, Mendoza 
went on a school record 19 consecutive game hit streak. She batted .561 
(32/57) to accompany 15 RBIs, 4 home runs, doubles and base on balls, striking 
out just once with a slugging of .842. Mendoza continued her success for 
the Cardinals with her third All-American and All-Pac-10 citations.[11] 
She posted top-10 season records in virtually every category, still currently 
ranking second in home runs and stolen bases.[10] For the March 14 week, 
she earned NFCA "Player of The Week" recognition for her performance of 
.461 (12/26) with 4 RBIs, three home runs, a double, three walks and a 
.846 slugging.[5] Mendoza helped lead Stanford to their first ever Women's 
College World Series appearance. The Cardinals were ousted on May 27 by 
the Arizona Wildcats despite wins over California Golden Bears and LSU 
Tigers.[12] The outfielder, however, was named to the All-Tournament Team 
for hitting .250 with an RBI and a double to her credit. It was her only 
appearance at the series. For a final season, Mendoza earned First Team 
citations for both conference and the NCAA.[13] With her fourth straight 
honor from the NCAA, Mendoza joined elite company as only the fifth player 
to accomplish the feat then. That year she also tied her home run record 
and ranked top-10 in almost every other category.[10] The week of March 
4, she was named NFCA's "Player of The Week" for a third time. She had 
hit .647 (11/17) with a home run, 5 doubles and 1.117 slugging. Later that 
season on May 8 with a 10–2 victory over the San Jose State Spartans, Mendoza 
drove in a career best 6 RBIs, 4 coming off her 50th career home run swing 
with Carol Forbes pitching.[14] In her four years Mendoza currently holds 
the career records in average, hits, home runs, slugging, runs and stolen 
bases. Her career doubles (ranked 5th in the NCAA all-time), triples, RBIs 
and walks are still top-10 records.[15] She was named the Stanford Athlete 
of the Year three times.[16] She was also named Pac-10 Player of the Week 
three times, a top 25 finalist for USA Softball Collegiate Player of the 
Year, and the Speedline Invitational Tournament MVP.[10] Mendoza graduated 
from Stanford with a Master’s Degree in Social Sciences and Education.[17] 
In 2004, Mendoza was a starting outfielder for Team USA at 2004 Athens 
Olympic Games. Prior to the tournament, Mendoza hit .380 on the "Aiming 
For Athens" tour with 42 RBIs and 10 home runs.[18] On August 14, Mendoza 
had two hits and two RBIs with a triple vs. Italy.[19] She repeated her 
performance on August 19 against host Greece, with a double in that game.[20] 
Team USA won the gold medal on August 23, though Mendoza was shut out by 
Australia.[21] Overall she went 5/20 (.250) scoring five times herself 
and hitting in 5 RBIs with a .400 slugging. In 2008, Mendoza was again 
an outfielder for Team USA and led in almost every category on the "Bound 
4 Beijing" Tour. She hit .495 with 107 RBIs and a .971 slugging.[22] At 
the Beijing Olympic Games, she drove in 4 RBIs vs. Chinese Taipei on August 
14.[23] In the finale, Mendoza was again shut out and her team won the 
silver medal, losing to Japan on August 21.[24] In addition, straight out 
of college, Mendoza went directly onto the US team. In 2003 and 2007, she 
was a gold medalist at the Pan American Games. She also won the silver 
medal at both the World Cup and Japan Cup. In 2006, Jessica was named the 
USA Softball "Female Athlete of the Year." She played for Team USA in the 
World Cup again in 2007, this time bringing home that gold medal. She went 
11/18 with a double, three home runs, and 16 RBIs. Mendoza won the ISF 
Women's World Championship, hitting .500 with 5 home runs and 16 RBIs. 
In 2008, she was named to the Canada Cup All-Star Team. Mendoza declined 
an invitation to play for the US in 2011 to focus on National Pro Fastpitch.[25] 
Mendoza joined the National Pro Fastpitch in 2005 with the Arizona Heat. 
She hit a league best (though in limited playing time) .491 her rookie 
year.[26] After returning from maternity leave and a role with Team USA, 
Mendoza signed with the USSSA Pride.[27] In her two seasons with the Pride, 
Mendoza hit .284 and .377 respectively. The same two years her teams made 
the Cowles Cup Championship, winning the title in 2010. Mendoza was shut 
out vs. the Chicago Bandits's trio of Kristina Thorson, Nikki Nemitz, and 
Jessica Sallinger.[28] In the other finale, Mendoza was 2/4 with a double 
off Monica Abbott in a rematch with the Bandits who ultimately won 10–3 
on August 21.[29][30] Once again Mendoza and the Pride made the Cowles 
Cup Championship but lost to the Chicago Bandits. Mendoza was shut out 
but walked twice.[31] Mendoza works for ESPN and is currently a member 
of ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball broadcast team.[4] She also is a color 
analyst during the Women's College World Series and is a sideline reporter 
for ESPNU. On June 30, 2014, Mendoza began working as an analyst on ESPN's 
Baseball Tonight. She appears on the Monday editions of the show.[32] On 
June 16, 2015, Mendoza became the first female broadcaster in the booth 
for ESPN's College World Series coverage with Karl Ravech and Kyle Peterson.[33] 
On August 24, Mendoza was the first female analyst for a Major League Baseball 
game in the history of ESPN, during a game between the St. Louis Cardinals 
and the Arizona Diamondbacks.[34] Six days later, Mendoza filled in for 
suspended color commentator Curt Schilling for the Cubs-Dodgers game on 
Sunday Night Baseball. Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta pitched a no-hitter in 
the game. John Kruk, Dan Shulman and Mendoza called the 2015 American League 
Wild Card Game on October 6, and Mendoza became the first female analyst 
in MLB postseason history.[35][36] On January 13, 2016, ESPN announced 
that Mendoza would join the Sunday Night Baseball broadcast team full-time.[4]
