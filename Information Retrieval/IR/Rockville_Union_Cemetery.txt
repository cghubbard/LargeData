Rockville Cemetery (it was never known as Rockville Union Cemetery) was 
established in 1738 by the Anglican Prince George's Parish. It is the oldest 
burying ground in Rockville, Maryland and is located at 1350 Baltimore 
Road, adjacent to the Rockville Civic Center. Ownership changed in 1880 
to the Rockville Cemetery Association. The cemetery occupies something 
over 24 acres (97,000 m²) in two sections, an older, western section of 
7.7 acres (31,000 m²) and a newer, eastern section of almost 16.9 acres 
(68,000 m²). Those buried there include Upton Beall and E.B. Prettyman 
(Clerks of the Court), Walter Johnson[1] (baseball player and Montgomery 
County Commissioner), Judge and Mrs. Richard Johns Bowie, and the Pumphrey 
family (carpenters and undertakers). The author F. Scott Fitzgerald was 
buried there upon his death in 1940 but his remains and those of his wife 
Zelda Fitzgerald (who died in 1948) were moved to Saint Mary's Cemetery, 
also in Rockville, in 1975. The oldest remaining stone marker in Rockville 
Cemetery is that of John Harding (1685–1752). Coordinates: 39°5′3″N 77°7′32″W﻿
