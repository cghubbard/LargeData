The 1998 Toronto Blue Jays season was the franchise's twenty-second season 
of Major League Baseball. It resulted in the Blue Jays finishing third 
in the American League East with a record of 88 wins and 74 losses, which 
was their best record from their 1993 World Series-winning season until 
2015. With the disappointing last-place finish of the previous year, General 
Manager Gord Ash once again dug into the wallet to improve the team, signing 
reliever Randy Myers and slugger José Canseco as free agents. Though the 
team improved noticeably (thanks to another pitching Triple Crown and Cy 
Young Award-winning campaign by ace hurler Roger Clemens and a powerful 
lineup that featured Canseco, Carlos Delgado, Shawn Green, and José Cruz, 
Jr.), they could not finish ahead of the New York Yankees or the Boston 
Red Sox, who won 114 and 92 games en route to winning the division crown 
and Wild Card respectively. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]
