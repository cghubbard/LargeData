Eagle River is a city in Vilas County, Wisconsin, United States. The population 
was 1,398 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Vilas County.[6] 
Because of the many lakes in the area, the city is a popular vacation and 
retirement destination. The area contains many condominia, seasonal vacation 
homes, and hunting cabins. Eagle River was the site of the first permanent 
Indian settlement in the Wisconsin Northwoods, located on the shores of 
Watersmeet Lake where the Wisconsin River and Chain 0' Lakes meet. These 
early Indians, who were called Old Copper Indians, were succeeded by the 
Woodland Indians from 2,600 B.C. to 800 A.D. These Indians were probably 
the ancestors of the Chippewa, Potawatomi, and Menominee.[7] The first 
recorded white settler in what became Vilas County was a man named Ashman 
who established a trading post in Lac du Flambeau in 1818.[8] Eagle River's 
name was derived from the abundance of eagles nesting along the river. 
It is believed that Bethuel Draper and "Dutch Pete" Cramer camped in the 
area in 1853 and were responsible for naming the community. A settlement 
grew as other families settled in the area in 1857. The town of Eagle River 
was created by an act of the state legislature in 1885. Vilas County was 
set off from Oneida County on April 12, 1893 and named for William Freeman 
Vilas, a migrant from Vermont. Vilas had served for Wisconsin in the United 
States Senate from 1891 to 1897.[9][10] In the 1850s migrants from New 
England, primarily from Vermont and Connecticut, constructed a number of 
wagon roads and trails through Vilas County including the Ontonogan Mail 
Trail and a Military Road from Fort Howard to Fort Wilkins in Copper Harbor, 
Michigan.[8] Eagle River is located in southeastern Vilas County at 45°55′12″N
