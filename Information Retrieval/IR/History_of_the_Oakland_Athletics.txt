The history of the Athletics Major League Baseball franchise spans the 
period from 1901 to the present day, having begun in Philadelphia before 
moving to Kansas City in 1955 and then to its current home in Oakland, 
California, in 1968. In 1954, Chicago real estate magnate Arnold Johnson 
bought the Philadelphia Athletics and moved them to Kansas City. Although 
he was initially a hero for making Kansas City a major-league town, it 
soon became apparent that he was motivated more by profit than any regard 
for the baseball fans of Kansas City. He had long been a business associate 
of New York Yankees owners Dan Topping, Larry MacPhail and Del Webb, and 
had even bought Yankee Stadium in 1953, though the league owners forced 
Johnson to sell the property before acquiring the Athletics. He'd also 
bought Blues Stadium in Kansas City, home of the Yankees' top farm team, 
the Kansas City Blues of the American Association. After Johnson got permission 
to move the A's to Kansas City, he sold Blues Stadium to the city, which 
renamed it Kansas City Municipal Stadium and leased it back to Johnson. 
The lease gave Johnson a three-year escape clause if the team failed to 
draw one million or more customers per season. The subsequent lease signed 
in 1960 also contained an escape clause if the team failed to draw 850,000 
per season. Normally, Johnson would have had to pay the Yankees an indemnity 
for moving to Kansas City, and also would have had to reimburse the Yankees 
for the costs they incurred for moving the Blues to Denver to make way 
for the A's. Major-league rules of the time gave the Yankees the major-league 
rights to Kansas City. However, the Yankees waived these payments as soon 
as the purchase was approved. This, combined with the Yankees' thinly concealed 
support for the sale, led to rumors of collusion between Johnson and the 
Yankees.[1] Rumors abounded that Johnson's real motive was to operate the 
Athletics in Kansas City for a few years, then move the team to Los Angeles 
(the Brooklyn Dodgers would move there after the 1957 season). Whatever 
the concern about the move to Kansas City, fans turned out in record numbers 
for the era. In 1955, the Kansas City Athletics drew 1,393,054 to Municipal 
Stadium, a club record easily surpassing the previous record of 945,076 
in 1948; in fact, it was the third-highest attendance figure in the majors, 
behind only the all-powerful Yankees and the recently relocated Milwaukee 
Braves. That number would never be approached again while the team was 
in Kansas City, and would remain the club record for attendance until 1982—the 
Athletics' 15th season in Oakland. This was mainly because the A's were 
barely competitive; in five years under Johnson's ownership, the closest 
they got to a winning record was 1958, when they finished 73-81, eight 
games below .500 and 19 games out of first. Johnson's previous business 
ties to the Yankees resulted in several trades between the Athletics and 
the Bronx Bombers that helped keep the New York dynasty afloat. Invariably, 
any good young A's player was traded to the Yankees for aging veterans 
and cash. Over the years, Johnson would trade such key players as Roger 
Maris, Bobby Shantz, Héctor López, Clete Boyer, Art Ditmar and Ralph Terry 
to New York; in return, he did receive some talented younger players such 
as Norm Siebern and Jerry Lumpe, and the cash helped the team pay the bills. 
However, with few exceptions, the trades were heavily weighted in favor 
of the Yankees. This led to accusations from fans, reporters and even other 
teams that Johnson ran the A's as a Yankee farm team at the major-league 
level; ironic, since the old Kansas City Blues had been the Yankees' top 
affiliate from 1936 to 1954. On the positive side, Johnson devoted attention 
to player development for the first time in the history of the franchise. 
Previously, Connie Mack either did not or could not spend any money building 
a farm system, a major reason why his teams fell from World Series champions 
to cellar-dwellers so quickly. When Johnson bought the team, the A's only 
had three scouts in the entire organization. Johnson did make some improvements 
to the farm system, but was unwilling to pay top dollar for players that 
could get the A's within sight of contention. Johnson was returning from 
watching the Athletics in spring training when he was fatally stricken 
with a cerebral hemorrhage. He died in West Palm Beach, Florida on March 
3, 1960 at the age of 53. On December 19, 1960, Charles "Charlie" O. Finley 
purchased a controlling interest in the team from Johnson's estate after 
losing out to Johnson six years earlier in Philadelphia. He bought out 
the minority owners a year later. Finley promised the fans a new day. In 
a highly publicized move, he purchased a bus, pointed it in the direction 
of New York, and burned it to symbolize the end of the "special relationship" 
with the Yankees. He called another press conference to burn the existing 
lease at Municipal Stadium which included the despised "escape clause." 
He spent over $400,000 of his own money in stadium improvements (though 
in 1962 the city reimbursed $300,000 of this). He introduced new uniforms 
which had "Kansas City" on the road uniforms for the first time ever and 
an interlocking "KC" on the cap. This was the first time the franchise 
had acknowledged its home city on its uniforms. He announced, "My intentions 
are to keep the A's permanently in Kansas City and build a winning ball 
club. I have no intention of ever moving the franchise." The fans, in turn, 
regarded Finley as the savior of Major League Baseball in Kansas City. 
Finley immediately hired Frank Lane, a veteran baseball man with a reputation 
as a prolific trader, as general manager. Lane began engineering trades 
with several other teams, including the Yankees, the bus-burning stunt 
notwithstanding. Lane lasted less than one year, being fired during the 
1961 season. He was temporarily replaced by Pat Friday, whose sole qualification 
for the job was that he managed one of Finley's insurance offices. On paper, 
Friday remained general manager until 1965, when he was replaced by Hank 
Peters. After only a year, Peters was fired and replaced by Eddie Lopat, 
who also lasted only one season. After Lopat's ouster in 1966, the team 
had no formal general manager until 1981. In fact, Friday, Peters and Lopat 
were mere figureheads. With the firing of Lane in 1961, Finley effectively 
became a one-man band as owner, president and de facto general manager, 
and would remain so for the duration of his ownership. Finley made further 
changes to the team's uniforms. The Philadelphia Athletics wore blue and 
white or black and gray outfits through most of their history;[1]; in the 
last years in Philadelphia and the first in Kansas City, the team used 
a red, white and navy blue scheme.[2] In 1963, Finley changed the team's 
colors to "Kelly Green, Fort Knox Gold and Wedding Gown White". In June 
1963, Bill Bryson wrote of the uniforms, Kelly green is the Athletics' 
accent color. It was more a nauseous green the players wore on their wholesome, 
clean-cut faces the first few times they had to appear in public looking 
like refugees from a softball league.[2] Finley replaced Mack's elephant 
with a Missouri mule—not just a cartoon logo, but a real mule, which he 
named after himself: "Charlie O, the Mule." He also began phasing out the 
team name "Athletics" in favor of simply "A's." Some of his other changes—for 
instance, his repeated attempts to mimic Yankee Stadium's famous right-field 
"home run porch"—were less successful. AL President Joe Cronin ordered 
Finley to remove the fence which duplicated the 296-foot right-field foul 
line in Yankee Stadium. Smarting from this edict from the league office, 
Finley ordered Municipal Stadium PA announcer Jack Layton to announce, 
"That would have been a home run in Yankee Stadium", whenever a fly ball 
passed the limit in Municipal Stadium's outfield. That practice ended quickly, 
however, when it was apparent that other teams were hitting more "would-be" 
home runs than the A's. While the A's were still dreadful in the first 
eight years of Finley's ownership, he began to lay the groundwork for a 
future contender. Finley poured significant resources into the minor league 
system for the first time in the history of the franchise. By 1966, the 
A's were reckoned as having the strongest farm system in the majors. He 
was assisted by the creation of the baseball draft in 1965, which forced 
young prospects to sign with the team that drafted them—at the price offered 
by the team—if they wanted to play professional baseball. Thus, Finley 
was spared from having to compete with wealthier teams for top talent. 
The Athletics, owners of the worst record in the American League in 1964, 
had the first pick in the first draft, selecting Rick Monday on June 8, 
1965. Almost as soon as the ink dried on his purchase of the Athletics, 
Finley began shopping the Athletics to other cities despite his promises 
that the A's would remain in Kansas City. Soon after the lease-burning 
stunt, it was discovered that what actually burned was a blank boilerplate 
commercial lease available at any stationery store. The actual lease was 
still in force—including the escape clause. Finley later admitted he had 
no intention of rewriting the lease, that the whole thing was a publicity 
stunt. In 1961 and 1962, Finley talked to people in Dallas-Fort Worth and 
a four-man group appeared[3] before American League owners, but no formal 
motion was put forward to move the team away from Kansas City. In January 
1964, he signed an agreement to move the A's to Louisville, promising to 
change the team's name to the "Kentucky Athletics".[4] (Other names suggested 
for the team were the "Louisville Sluggers" and "Kentucky Colonels", which 
would have allowed the team to keep the letters "KC" on their uniforms.) 
by another 9–1 vote his request was denied. Six weeks later, by the same 
9–1 margin, the A.L. owners denied Finley's request to move the team to 
Oakland. These requests came as no surprise, as impending moves to these 
cities, as well as to Atlanta, Milwaukee, New Orleans, San Diego and Seattle— 
all of which Finley had considered as new homes for the Athletics — had 
long been afloat. He also threatened to move the A's to a "cow pasture" 
in Peculiar, Missouri, complete with temporary grandstands. Not surprisingly, 
attendance tailed off. Finally, American League President Joe Cronin persuaded 
Finley to sign a four-year lease with Municipal Stadium. Then on October 
18, 1967, A.L. owners at last gave Finley permission to move the Athletics 
to Oakland for the 1968 season. According to some reports, Cronin promised 
Finley that he could move the team after the 1967 season as an incentive 
to sign the new lease with Municipal Stadium. The move came in spite of 
approval by voters in Jackson County, Missouri of a bond issue for a brand 
new baseball stadium (the eventual Kauffman Stadium) to be completed in 
1973. Then-U.S. Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri blasted Finley on 
the floor of the Senate, calling Oakland "the luckiest city since Hiroshima."[5] 
When Symington threatened to have baseball's antitrust exemption revoked, 
the owners responded with a hasty round of expansion. Kansas City was awarded 
an American League expansion team, the Royals. They were initially slated 
to begin play in 1971. However, Symington was not willing to have Kansas 
City wait three years for another team, and renewed his threat to have 
baseball's antitrust exemption revoked unless the expansion teams (the 
Royals and the Seattle Pilots) began play in 1969. The owners complied, 
despite stadium problems in Seattle. During the Johnson years, the Athletics' 
home attendance averaged just under one million per season, respectable 
numbers for the era, especially in light of the team's dreadful on-field 
performance. In contrast, during the years of Finley's ownership, the team 
averaged under 680,000 per year in Kansas City. According to baseball writer 
Rob Neyer (a native of the Kansas City area), this was largely because 
Finley tried to sell baseball tickets like he sold insurance. Just before 
the 1960 season, he mailed brochures to 600,000 people in the area, and 
only made $20,000 in ticket sales.[6] During their 13-year stay in Kansas 
City, their overall record was 829–1,224, for a winning percentage of .404. 
The Athletics' Oakland tenure opened with a 3-1 loss to the Baltimore Orioles 
on April 17, 1968. They played their home games at the recently opened 
Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, the home of the NFL's Oakland Raiders, 
with whom they shared the stadium. The Athletics drew national attention 
when, on May 8, 1968, Jim "Catfish" Hunter pitched a perfect game (the 
American League's first since 1922) against the Minnesota Twins. The Athletics, 
under the leadership of manager Bob Kennedy, ended the 1968 campaign with 
an 82-80 record, their first winning record since 1952 (in Philadelphia). 
The team's output also represented a 20-win increase over the prior year's 
62-99 finish. Bob Kennedy was fired at the end of the season. The Athletics 
began the 1969 season under the leadership of Hank Bauer. On July 20, 1969, 
future ace Vida Blue made his major league debut. The Athletics' on-field 
performance continued to improve; led by Reggie Jackson's 47 home runs, 
the A's finished the season with a record of 88-74. This was good enough 
for second place (behind the Minnesota Twins) in the newly created American 
League West division. This improvement, though, was not enough for Finley; 
Hank Bauer was fired (and replaced with John McNamara) near the end of 
the season. The team's record stood at 80-69 at the time of his firing. 
McNamara himself would be fired following an 89-73 finish in 1970. He was 
replaced by former Boston Red Sox manager Dick Williams. The Athletics, 
following two consecutive second-place finishes, finally claimed the division 
crown in 1971. The A's would win 101 games (their first 100-win season 
since finishing 107-45 in 1931. However, they lost to the Baltimore Orioles 
in the American League Championship Series. In 1972, the A's won their 
first league pennant since 1931 and faced the Cincinnati Reds in the World 
Series. That year, the A's began wearing solid green or solid gold jerseys, 
with contrasting white pants, at a time when most other teams wore all-white 
uniforms at home and all-grey ones on the road. Similar to more colorful 
amateur softball uniforms, they were considered a radical departure for 
their time. Furthermore, in conjunction with a Moustache Day promotion, 
Finley offered $300 to any player who grew a moustache by Father's Day, 
at a time when every other team forbade facial hair. When Father's Day 
arrived, every member of the team collected a bonus. The 1972 World Series 
against the Cincinnati Reds was termed "The Hairs vs. the Big Squares", 
as the Reds wore more traditional uniforms and required their players to 
be clean-shaven and short-haired. A contemporaneous book about the team 
was called Mustache Gang. The A's seven-game victory over the heavily favored 
Reds gave the team its first World Series Championship since 1930. They 
defended their title in 1973 and 1974. Unlike Mack's champions, who thoroughly 
dominated their opposition, the A's teams of the 1970s played well enough 
to win their division (which was usually known as the "American League 
Least" during this time). They then defeated teams that had won more games 
during the regular season with good pitching, good defense, and clutch 
hitting. Finley called this team the "Swingin' A's." Players such as Reggie 
Jackson, Sal Bando, Joe Rudi, Bert Campaneris, Catfish Hunter, Rollie Fingers, 
and Vida Blue formed the nucleus of these teams. The players often said 
in later years that they played so well as a team because almost to a man, 
they hated Finley with a passion. For instance, Finley threatened to pack 
Jackson off to the minors in 1969 after Jackson hit 47 homers; Commissioner 
Bowie Kuhn had to intervene in their contract dispute. Kuhn intervened 
again after Blue won the A.L. Cy Young Award in 1971 and Finley threatened 
to send him to the minors. Finley's tendency for micromanaging his team 
actually dated to the team's stay in Kansas City. Among the more notable 
incidents during this time was a near-mutiny in 1967; Finley responded 
by releasing the A's best hitter, Ken Harrelson, who promptly signed with 
the Red Sox and helped lead them to the pennant. The Athletics' victory 
over the New York Mets in the 1973 Series was marred by Finley's antics. 
Finley forced Mike Andrews to sign a false affidavit saying he was injured 
after the reserve second baseman committed two consecutive errors in the 
12th inning of the A's Game Two loss to the Mets. When other team members, 
manager Dick Williams, and virtually the entire viewing public rallied 
to Andrews' defense, Kuhn forced Finley to back down. However, there was 
nothing that said the A's had to play Andrews. Andrews entered Game 4 in 
the eighth inning as a pinch-hitter to a standing ovation from sympathetic 
Mets fans. He promptly grounded out, and Finley ordered him benched for 
the remainder of the Series. Andrews never played another major league 
game. As it was, the incident allowed the Mets, a team that went but 82–79 
during the regular season, to go seven games before losing to a superior 
team. Williams was so disgusted by the affair that he resigned after the 
Series. Finley retaliated by vetoing Williams' attempt to become manager 
of the Yankees. Finley claimed that since Williams still owed Oakland the 
last year of his contract, he could not manage anywhere else. Finley relented 
later in 1974 and allowed Williams to take over as manager of the California 
Angels. After the Athletics' victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 
1974 Series (under Alvin Dark), pitcher Catfish Hunter filed a grievance, 
claiming that the team had violated its contract with Hunter by failing 
to make timely payment on an insurance policy during the 1974 season as 
called for. On December 13, 1974, arbitrator Peter Seitz ruled in Hunter's 
favor. As a result, Hunter became a free agent, and signed a contract with 
the Yankees for the 1975 season. Despite the loss of Hunter, the A's repeated 
as A.L. West champions in 1975, but lost the ALCS to Boston in a 3-game 
sweep. In 1975, fed up with poor attendance in Oakland during the team's 
championship years, Finley thought of moving yet again. When Seattle filed 
a lawsuit against Major League Baseball over the move of the Seattle Pilots 
to Milwaukee, Finley and others came up with an elaborate shuffle which 
would move the ailing Chicago White Sox to Seattle. Finley then would move 
the A's to Chicago, closer to his home in LaPorte, Indiana; and take the 
White Sox' place at Comiskey Park. The scheme fell through when White Sox 
owner John Allyn sold the team to another colorful owner, Bill Veeck, who 
was not interested in leaving Chicago. As the 1976 season got underway, 
the basic rules of player contracts were changing. Seitz had ruled that 
baseball's reserve clause only bound players for one season after their 
contract expired. Thus, all players not signed to multi-year contracts 
would be eligible for free agency at the end of the 1976 season. The balance 
of power had shifted from the owners to the players for the first time 
since the days of the Federal League. Like Mack had done twice before, 
Finley reacted by trading star players and attempting to sell others. On 
June 15, 1976, Finley sold left fielder Rudi and relief pitcher Fingers 
to Boston for $1 million each, and pitcher Blue to the New York Yankees 
for $1.5 million. Three days later, Kuhn voided the transactions in the 
"best interests of baseball." Amid the turmoil, the A's still finished 
second in the A.L. West, 2.5 games behind the Royals. After the 1976 season, 
most of the Athletics' veteran players did become eligible for free agency, 
and predictably almost all left. Several decades and 3,000 miles later, 
one of baseball's most storied franchises suffered yet another dismemberment 
of a dynasty team. As happened with the end of the A's first dynasty in 
the early 1900s, the collapse was swift and total. The next three years 
were as bad as the worst days in Philadelphia or Kansas City, with the 
A's finishing last twice and next-to-last once. In 1977, for instance—only 
three years after winning the World Series and two years after playing 
for the pennant—the A's finished with the worst record in the American 
League, and the second-worst record in baseball. They even trailed the 
expansion Seattle Mariners (though by only 1/2 game, as one game with the 
Minnesota Twins was canceled by weather and never made up). At the end 
of the 1977 season, Finley attempted to trade Blue to the Reds for a player 
of lesser stature and cash, but Kuhn vetoed the deal, claiming that it 
was tantamount to a fire sale similar to the sales he voided a year earlier. 
He also claimed that adding Blue to the Reds' already formidable pitching 
staff would make a mockery of the National League West race. Later, the 
Commissioner approved a trade of relief pitcher Doug Bair to the Reds in 
a deal that resembled a true trade. At the same time, Blue was traded across 
the bay to the San Francisco Giants in a multi-player trade that likewise 
received the Commissioner's blessing. The A's had never drawn well since 
moving to Oakland (even during the World Series years), and during the 
next three years, attendance dropped so low that the Coliseum became known 
as the "Oakland Mausoleum." At one point during the late 1970s, crowds 
could be counted in the hundreds. The low point came in 1979, when an April 
17 game against the Mariners drew an announced crowd of 653. However, A's 
officials claimed the actual attendance was 550, while first baseman Dave 
Revering thought the crowd was closer to 200. What is beyond dispute is 
that it was the smallest "crowd" in the West Coast portion of A's history.[5] 
The Coliseum's upkeep also went downhill. The franchise's rapid deterioration 
so soon after being the most powerful team in the game led some fans to 
nickname them "the Triple-A's." Even during their championship years, the 
A's had been practically invisible outside of Oakland because they rarely 
had radio or television contracts. For the first month of the 1978 season, 
the A's broadcast their games on KALX, a 10-watt college radio station 
run by the University of California, Berkeley.[5] KALX was practically 
unlistenable more than 10 miles from Oakland. At that time, the A's had 
a radio network stretching all the way to Hawaii, leading one fan to joke, 
"Honolulu? How about here?"[7] In 1979, the A's didn't sign a radio contract 
until the night before opening day. The A's near-invisibility prompted 
Oakland and Alameda County to sue Finley and the A's for breach of contract 
in 1979.[5] Finley nearly sold the team to buyers who would have moved 
them to Mile High Stadium in Denver for the 1978 season and the Louisiana 
Superdome in New Orleans for 1979. Though the American League owners appeared 
to favor the Denver deal, it fell through when the city of Oakland and 
Alameda County refused to release the A's from their lease. At the time, 
the Oakland Raiders were threatening to move to Los Angeles, and city and 
county officials were not willing to lose Oakland's status as a big-league 
city in its own right. Not surprisingly, only 306,763 paying customers 
showed up to watch the A's in 1979, the team's worst attendance since leaving 
Philadelphia. After three dismal seasons on the field and at the gate, 
the team started to gel again. In a final masterstroke as owner, Finley 
hired Berkeley native Billy Martin to manage the young team, led by new 
young stars Rickey Henderson, Mike Norris, Tony Armas, and Dwayne Murphy. 
Martin made believers of his young charges, "Billyball" was used to market 
the team, and the Athletics finished second in 1980. However, during that 
same season Finley's wife sought a divorce and would not accept part of 
a baseball team in a property settlement. With most of his money tied up 
in the A's or his insurance empire, Finley had to sell the team. He agreed 
in principle to sell to businessman Marvin Davis, who would have moved 
the Athletics to Denver. However, just before Finley and Davis were due 
to sign a definitive agreement, the Raiders announced their move to Los 
Angeles. Oakland and Alameda County officials let it be known that they 
would not allow any prospective owner to break the Coliseum lease. Forced 
to turn to local buyers, Finley sold the A's to San Francisco clothing 
manufacturer Walter A. Haas, Jr., president of Levi Strauss & Co. prior 
to the 1981 season. It would not be the last time that the Raiders directly 
affected the A's future. Despite winning three World Series and two other 
A.L. West Division titles, the A's on-field success did not translate into 
success at the box office during the Finley Era in Oakland. Average home 
attendance from 1968–1980 was 777,000 per season, with 1,075,518 in 1975 
being the highest attendance for a Finley-owned team. In marked contrast, 
during the first year of Haas' ownership, the Athletics drew 1,304,052—in 
a season shortened by a player strike. Were it not for the strike, the 
A's were on a pace to draw over 2.2 million in 1981. This lent credence 
to the theory that Bay Area residents stayed away from the Coliseum because 
they didn't want to give their money to Finley.[5] The A's lost in the 
American League Championship Series after winning the "first half" AL West 
Division title of the strike-interrupted 1981 season. The club finished 
with the second-best overall record in baseball, and the best record in 
the American League. Had the season not been split in half, the 1981 A's 
would have gone wire-to-wire. During the 15 years of Haas' ownership, the 
Athletics became one of baseball's most successful teams at the gate, drawing 
2,900,217 in 1990, still the club record for single season attendance, 
as well as on the field. Average annual home attendance during those years 
(excluding the strike years of 1981 and 1994) was over 1.9 million. Haas 
set about changing the team's image. He ditched Charlie O. as the team 
mascot and restored the traditional team name of "Athletics" as soon as 
he closed on the purchase, with the ownership group formally known as "The 
Oakland Athletics Baseball Company." He also installed pictures of Connie 
Mack and other greats from the Philadelphia days in the team office; Finley 
had scarcely acknowledged the team's past. While the team colors remained 
green, gold, and white, the bright Kelly green was replaced with a more 
subdued forest green. After a 23-year hiatus, the elephant was restored 
as the club mascot in 1988. The script "Athletics", which had adorned home 
and road jerseys from 1954–1960, was returned to home jerseys in 1987. 
Under the Haas ownership, the minor league system was rebuilt, which bore 
fruit later that decade as José Canseco (1986), Mark McGwire (1987), and 
Walt Weiss (1988) were chosen as A.L. Rookies of the Year. During the 1986 
season, Tony La Russa was hired as the Athletics' manager, a post he held 
until the end of 1995. In 1987, La Russa's first full year as manager, 
the team finished at 81–81, its best record in seven seasons. Beginning 
in 1988, the Athletics won the A.L. pennant three years in a row. Reminiscent 
of their Philadelphia predecessors, this A's team finished with the best 
record of any team in the major leagues during all 3 years, winning 104 
(1988), 99 (1989), and 103 (1990) games, featuring such stars as McGwire, 
Canseco, Weiss, Rickey Henderson, Carney Lansford, Dave Stewart, and Dennis 
Eckersley. During this time, Rickey Henderson shattered Lou Brock's modern 
major league record by stealing 130 bases in a single season (1982), a 
total which has not been approached since. On May 1, 1991, Henderson broke 
one of baseball's most famous records when he stole the 939th base of his 
career, one more than Brock. Regular season dominance led to some success 
in the post-season. The Athletics' lone World Series championship of the 
era was a four-game sweep of the cross-bay rival San Francisco Giants in 
the 1989 World Series. Unfortunately for the A's, their sweep of the Giants 
was overshadowed by the Loma Prieta earthquake that occurred at the start 
of Game 3 before a national television audience. This forced the remaining 
games to be delayed for ten days. When play resumed, the atmosphere was 
dominated more by a sense of relief than celebration by baseball fans. 
Heavily favored Athletics teams lost the World Series in both 1988, to 
the Los Angeles Dodgers, and in 1990, to the Cincinnati Reds. The latter 
was a shocking four-game sweep reminiscent of the A's loss to the Boston 
Braves 76 years earlier. The team began declining, winning the A.L. West 
championship in 1992 (but losing to Toronto in the ALCS), then finishing 
last in 1993. Walter Haas died in 1995, and the team was sold to San Francisco 
Bay Area real estate developers Steve Schott (third cousin to one-time 
Cincinnati Reds' owner Marge Schott), silent partner David Etheridge and 
Ken Hofmann, prior to the 1996 season. Once again, the Athletics' star 
players were traded or sold, as the new owners' goal was to cut payroll 
drastically. Many landed with the St. Louis Cardinals, including McGwire, 
Eckersley, and manager La Russa. In a turn of events eerily reminiscent 
of the A's Roger Maris trade 38 years before, Mark McGwire celebrated his 
first full season with the Cardinals by setting a new major league home 
run record. The Schott-Hofmann ownership allocated resources to building 
and maintaining a strong minor league system while almost always refusing 
to pay the going rate to keep star players on the team once they become 
free agents. Perhaps as a result, at the turn of the 21st century, the 
A's were a team that usually finished at or near the top of the A.L. West 
Division, but could not advance beyond the first round of the playoffs. 
The Athletics made the playoffs for four straight years, from 2000 to 2003, 
but lost their first round (best three-out-of-five) series in each case, 
3 games to 2. In two of those years (2001 against the Yankees and 2003 
against the Red Sox), the Athletics won the first two games of the series, 
only to lose the next three straight. In 2001, Oakland became the first 
team to lose a best-of-five series after winning both of the first two 
games on the road. In 2004, the A's missed the playoffs altogether, losing 
the final series of the season—and the divisional title—to the Anaheim 
Angels. This period in Oakland history featured splendid performances from 
a trio of young starting pitchers: right-hander Tim Hudson and left-handers 
Mark Mulder and Barry Zito. Between 1999 and 2006, the so-called "Big Three" 
helped the Athletics to emerge into a perennial powerhouse in the American 
League West, combining for a collective record of 261–131. They gave the 
Athletics a 1–2–3 punch to add to talented infielders and potent hitters, 
such as first baseman Jason Giambi, shortstop Miguel Tejada, and third 
baseman Eric Chavez. Giambi was named American League MVP in 2000, and 
Tejada won an MVP Award of his own in 2002, a year which also saw Zito 
win 23 games and the Cy Young Award. On May 29, 2000, Randy Velarde achieved 
an unassisted triple play against the Yankees. In the sixth, second baseman 
Velarde caught Shane Spencer's line drive, tagged Jorge Posada running 
from first to second, and stepped on second before Tino Martinez could 
return. (Velarde had also pulled off an unassisted triple play during a 
spring training game that year). This was only the 11th unassisted triple 
play in the history of Major League Baseball. The general manager of the 
Athletics, Billy Beane, has become notable due to Michael Lewis's portrayal 
of Beane's novel approach to business decisions and scouting, referred 
to as Moneyball, both the title of the book, and hence the school of baseball 
business management. The Athletics organization began redefining the way 
that major league baseball teams evaluate player talent. They began filling 
their system with players who did not possess traditionally valued baseball 
"tools" of throwing, fielding, hitting, hitting for power and running. 
Instead, they drafted for unconventional statistical prowess: on-base percentage 
for hitters (rather than batting average) and strikeout/walk ratios for 
pitchers (rather than velocity). These undervalued stats came cheaply. 
With the sixth-lowest payroll in baseball in 2002, the Oakland Athletics 
won an American League best 103 games. They spent $41 million that season, 
while the Yankees, who also won 103 games, spent $126 million. It should 
be noted, however, that the aforementioned trio of pitchers, Zito, Mulder, 
and Hudson, were in large part responsible for the success of the team 
and were not signed because of "Moneyball" ideas. The Athletics have continually 
succeeded at winning, and defying market economics, keeping their payroll 
near the bottom of the league. For example, after the 2004 season, in which 
the A's placed second in their division, Beane shocked many by breaking 
up the Big Three, trading Tim Hudson to the Atlanta Braves and Mark Mulder 
to the St. Louis Cardinals. To many, the trades appeared bizarre, in that 
the two pitchers were seen to be at or near the top of their game; however, 
the decision was perfectly in line with Beane's business model as outlined 
in Moneyball. The Mulder trade, to many experts' surprise, turned into 
a steal for the Athletics, as little-known starter Dan Haren ended up pitching 
far better for Oakland than Mulder did for St. Louis. Also during this 
time, the Athletics won an American League record 20 games in a row, from 
August 13 to September 4, 2002. The last three games were won in dramatic 
fashion, each victory coming in the bottom of the ninth inning. Win number 
20 was notable because the A's, with Tim Hudson pitching, jumped to an 
11–0 lead against the AL-cellar dwelling Kansas City Royals, only to slowly 
give up eleven unanswered runs to lose the lead. Then, Scott Hatteberg, 
enduring criticism as Jason Giambi's replacement, hit a pinch-hit home 
run off Royals closer Jason Grimsley in the bottom of the 9th inning to 
win 12–11. The streak was snapped two nights later in Minneapolis, the 
A's losing 6–0 to the Minnesota Twins. The Major League record for consecutive 
games without a loss is 26, set by the NL's New York Giants in 1916. There 
was a tie game embedded in that streak (ties were not uncommon in the days 
before stadium lights) and the record for consecutive wins with no ties 
is 21, held by the Chicago Cubs on their way to the NL pennant in 1935. 
On March 30, 2005, the Athletics were sold to a group fronted by real estate 
developer Lewis Wolff, although the majority owner is John J. Fisher, son 
of The Gap, Inc.'s founder. Wolff, though a Los Angeles businessman, had 
successfully developed many real estate projects in and around San Jose. 
The previous ownership had retained Wolff to help them find an adequate 
parcel on which to construct a new stadium. Because of Wolff's background, 
rumors that he wanted to move the team to San Jose surfaced periodically 
upon his purchase of the team. However, any such plans were always complicated 
by the claims of the cross-bay San Francisco Giants that they own the territorial 
rights to San Jose and Santa Clara County. In 2005, many pundits picked 
the Athletics to finish last as a result of Beane's dismantling of the 
Big Three. At first, the experts appeared vindicated, as the A's were mired 
in last place on May 31 with a 19–32 (.373) won-loss record. After that 
the team began to gel, playing at a .622 clip for the remainder of the 
season, eventually finishing 88–74 (.543), seven games behind the newly 
renamed Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and for many weeks seriously contending 
for the AL West crown. Pitcher Huston Street was voted the A.L. Rookie 
of the Year in 2005, the second year in a row an Athletic won that award, 
shortstop Bobby Crosby having won in 2004. For the fifth straight season, 
third baseman Eric Chavez won the A.L. Gold Glove Award at that position. 
The 2006 season brought the A's back to the postseason after a three-year 
absence. After finishing the season at 93–69, four games ahead of the Angels, 
the A's were considered the underdog against the highly favored Minnesota 
Twins. The A's swept the series 3–0 however, despite having to start on 
the road and losing second baseman Mark Ellis, who sustained a broken finger 
after getting hit by a pitch in the second game. Their victory was short-lived 
though, as the A's were swept 4–0 by the Detroit Tigers. Manager Ken Macha 
was fired by Billy Beane on October 16, four days after their loss in the 
2006 American League Championship Series. Beane cited a disconnect between 
him and his players as well as a general unhappiness among the team as 
the reason for his sudden departure.[8] Macha was replaced by bench coach 
and former major league catcher Bob Geren. Following the 2006 season, the 
A's also lost ace Barry Zito to the Giants due to free agency. They also 
lost their DH and MVP candidate Frank Thomas to free agency but filled 
his role with Mike Piazza for 2007. Piazza, a lifetime National League 
player, agreed to become a full-time DH for the first time in his career. 
The 2007 season was a disappointing season for the A's as they suffered 
from injuries to several key players Rich Harden, Huston Street, Eric Chavez, 
and Mike Piazza. For the first time since the 1998 season, the A's finished 
with a losing record. The Athletics signed international free agent Michael 
Inoa to the largest bonus in team and international free agent history. 
The 2008 off-season started with controversy, as the A's traded ace pitcher 
Dan Haren to the Arizona Diamondbacks for prospects. This would be followed 
by trades of outfielder Nick Swisher, who was considered to be a fan-favorite, 
to the Chicago White Sox, and another fan-favorite Mark Kotsay (also outfielder) 
to the Atlanta Braves. The trades, especially the first two, caused a lot 
of anger among fans and the media. The A's were considered to be a "rebuilding" 
team and were expected to be among the bottom-feeders of the MLB in the 
2008 season. However, the A's performed well into late May, and even held 
first place in the AL West for a good amount of time, but a 2–7 roadtrip 
in mid-May allowed the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim to take first place. 
On April 24, just weeks after playing against them while on the Blue Jays, 
Frank Thomas re-signed with the A's, having been released by the Jays after 
a slow start. On July 8, the A's were involved in a blockbuster trade, 
dealing Rich Harden and Chad Gaudin to the Chicago Cubs for Sean Gallagher, 
Josh Donaldson, Eric Patterson, and Matt Murton. Then on July 17, the A's 
traded Joe Blanton to the Philadelphia Phillies for three minor leaguers. 
An 18–37 record for the months of July and August (including a 10-game 
losing streak) dropped the A's into third place, where they would finish 
the season. They ended 2008 with a disappointing 75–86 record. Several 
players were acquired in the offseason trades (pitchers Dana Eveland and 
Greg Smith from the Dan Haren trade, outfielder Ryan Sweeney from the Swisher 
trade and reliever Joey Devine from the Mark Kotsay trade). Carlos González 
and Gio González (no relation) from the Haren and Swisher trades, respectively, 
also performed well for the Triple A Sacramento Rivercats. It is worth 
pointing out that Haren, Swisher, and Kotsay have all played well in their 
new teams. Kotsay himself had a game-winning RBI as a pinch-hitter, against 
his former team on May 16 in Game 1 of an interleague series between the 
A's and Braves. In the 2009 offseason, the A's traded promising young star 
OF Carlos González, closer Huston Street and starting pitcher Greg Smith 
for Matt Holliday of the Colorado Rockies. On January 6, 2009, Jason Giambi 
signed a one-year, $4.6 million contract with a 2nd year option. Giambi 
said he was glad to be back as he put on his old number 16. Also signed 
were infielders Orlando Cabrera of the Chicago White Sox and Nomar Garciaparra 
of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The first half of the season the team played 
relatively poor, but finished the second half strong, yet still posting 
a losing record. Holliday was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals for prospects 
and Giambi was released in August after spending time on the DL. On December 
22, 2009, Sports Illustrated named general manager Billy Beane as number 
10 on its list of the Top 10 GMs/Executives of the Decade (in all sports).[9] 
The offseason was busy from the start. The team dealt the key-player from 
the Holliday trade, Brett Wallace, to the Toronto Blue Jays for OF Michael 
Taylor. After missing all of the 2009 season, Ben Sheets signed a 1-year 
deal. The team had a decent spring, posting a better record than other 
AL West teams. To begin the regular season, the team had 2 walk-off wins. 
On May 9, 42 years almost to the day after Catfish Hunter, A's pitcher 
Dallas Braden pitched a perfect game, the 19th in Major League history, 
in a 4-0 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays at the Coliseum. The next homestand 
was a week-long celebration of the feat, with a commemorative graphic placed 
on the outfield wall on May 17. Oakland finished the 2010 season with an 
81-81 record; 2nd in the division, 9 games behind Texas, and 1 game ahead 
of Los Angeles. Oakland finished the 2011 season with a 74-88 record; 3rd 
in the division, 22 games behind Texas. Pitcher Rich Harden returned on 
a one-year deal. Hideki Matsui was signed as a DH on a one-year deal. Vin 
Mazarro was traded to the Royals for David DeJesus. Travis Buck, Jack Cust, 
and Edwin Encarnación were lost to the Indians, Mariners, and Blue Jays 
(respectively). Encarnacion was later claimed off waivers. Rajai Davis 
was traded to Toronto for two pitchers. Eric Chavez was lost to the Yankees 
as a free agent. After an offseason that saw All Star pitchers Gio Gonzalez, 
Trevor Cahill, and Andrew Bailey traded away, the A's entered the 2012 
season with low expectations. This season was Bob Melvin's first full season 
as the A's manager. During the trading period, the A's had traded fan-favorite 
catcher Kurt Suzuki to the Washington Nationals for cash considerations. 
The A's also traded relief pitcher Fautino de los Santos to the Milwaukee 
Brewers for catcher George Kottaras. On August 15, veteran starting pitcher 
Bartolo Colón received a 50-game suspension after testing positive for 
performing-enhancing drugs. On September 5, veteran pitcher Brandon McCarthy 
was struck in the head by a line drive off of the bat of Erick Aybar ending 
his 2012 season. The A's entered the last month of the season with an all-rookie 
starting rotation, but by the end of the month, they had pulled within 
2 games of the Texas Rangers for the AL West lead, setting the stage for 
a season ending, 3 game series that would decide the winner of the 2012 
division title. The A's swept the series, culminating in 12-5 victory which 
saw the A's come back from a 4 run deficit to clinch the AL West for the 
first time since 2006. The A's ended the regular season with a record of 
94-68, leading the Major Leagues in walk-off wins, with 14 in the regular 
season, and one in Game 4 of the American League Division Series. The A's 
lost the ALDS to the eventual American League Champion Detroit Tigers in 
5 games. Bob Melvin was awarded the 2012 AL Manager of the Year award, 
and outfielder Josh Reddick was awarded a Gold Glove, becoming the first 
A's outfielder since 1985 to do so. Following the season shortstop Cliff 
Pennington was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks for outfielder Chris 
Young, as part of a 3 team trade. In 2013, under manager Bob Melvin after 
going 96-66 and claiming their second straight division title over the 
heavily favored Texas Rangers and Los Angeles Angels,the Athletics lost 
Game 5 of the ALDS to Justin Verlander and the Detroit Tigers for the second 
straight season in their own ballpark. Josh Donaldson had an MVP-caliber 
season, with a .301 batting average 24 home runs, and 93 RBIs. Despite 
his age, Bartolo Colón was in contention for a Cy Young Award, going 18-6, 
with 117 strikeouts and a 2.65 ERA. During the regular season the A's saw 
the additions of former A's catcher Kurt Suzuki from the Washington Nationals, 
Alberto Callaspo from the Los Angeles Angels,and Stephen Vogt off waivers 
from the Tampa Bay Rays.Grant Balfour broke the A's record for most consecutive 
saves and the A's saw the growth of young players like Jed Lowrie, Yoenis 
Céspedes, Josh Donaldson, and Sonny Gray. The A's would finish in the top 
3 of the Major League Baseball in home runs and OPS. Even after the devastating 
loss to the Detroit Tigers, the A's retained most of their 2013 roster, 
only losing Colon and Balfour to free agency. The A's started out as a 
favorite to win the AL West again, and played up to that, having the best 
record in baseball at the All-Star break. To bolster their starting rotation, 
they acquired pitchers Jeff Samardzija and Jason Hammel from the Chicago 
Cubs for several top prospects on July 4, and later acquired Jon Lester 
from the Boston Red Sox at the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline for Yoenis 
Céspedes. However, without the big bat of Cespedes, poor production from 
All-Stars Josh Donaldson and Brandon Moss, and an injury to closer Sean 
Doolittle, they struggled in August and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 
caught up, sweeping them in a key 4-game series between the two teams. 
At the August 31 waiver trade deadline, the A's acquired first baseman 
Adam Dunn from the Chicago White Sox and cash considerations for a minor 
league player. Despite their struggles which continued into September, 
they made the playoffs on the last day of the season, and faced the Kansas 
City Royals in the Wild Card Game. While they carried a 7-3 lead going 
into the bottom of the 8th inning, they managed to relinquish it due to 
the Royals' baserunning skills coupled with ineffective pitching, allowing 
them to tie the game. They did regain the lead in the top of the 12th, 
but the Royals responded with 2 runs in the bottom of the inning, winning 
on a walk-off single by Salvador Pérez. The A's ended 2015 with a disappointing
