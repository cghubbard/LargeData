Clifford "Heathcliff" Johnson, Jr. (born July 22, 1947) is a retired Major 
League Baseball player who played for the Houston Astros (1972–1977), New 
York Yankees (1977–1979), Cleveland Indians (1979–1980), Chicago Cubs (1980), 
Oakland Athletics (1981–82), Toronto Blue Jays (1983–84, 1985–1986) and 
Texas Rangers (1985). He batted and threw right-handed and split time between 
catcher, first baseman, and outfielder in the early part of his Major League 
career before becoming primarily a full-time designated hitter. As a catcher 
at San Antonio's Wheatley High School in 1965, Johnson was the 83rd pick 
in the 1966 baseball draft by the Houston Astros. After six seasons in 
the minor leagues, he made his major league debut on September 13, 1972, 
and played for the Astros until partway through the 1977 season, when he 
was traded to the Yankees.[1] Johnson was a member of the 1977 and 1978 
Yankees World Series championship teams, both over the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
In 1979, he was traded to Cleveland 2 months after a locker room brawl 
with closer Rich Gossage that put Gossage on the disabled list for two 
months.[2] As a member of the Blue Jays in the mid-1980s, Johnson was a 
fan favorite at Exhibition Stadium until his retirement on September 30, 
1986. In a 15-season major League career, Johnson posted a .258 batting 
average with 196 home runs and 669 RBI in 1369 games played. Johnson held 
the MLB record for pinch hit home runs with 20 until he was surpassed by 
Matt Stairs in 2010. Johnson is brother-in-law of retired Major League
