The following is a History of the Atlanta Braves franchise of Major League 
Baseball. Milwaukee went wild over the Braves, who were welcomed as genuine 
heroes. The Braves finished 92-62 in their first season in Milwaukee, and 
drew a then-NL record 1.8 million fans. The success of the team was noted 
by many owners. Not coincidentally, the Philadelphia Athletics, St. Louis 
Browns, Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants would leave their original 
hometowns in the next five years. As the 1950s progressed, the reinvigorated 
Braves became increasingly competitive. Sluggers Eddie Mathews and Hank 
Aaron drove the offense (they would hit a combined 1,226 home runs as Braves, 
with 850 of those coming while the franchise was in Milwaukee), while Spahn, 
Lew Burdette and Bob Buhl anchored the rotation. In 1957, the Braves celebrated 
their first pennant in nine years spearheaded by Aaron's MVP season, as 
he led the National League in home runs and RBI. Perhaps the most memorable 
of his 44 round-trippers that season came on September 23, a two-run walk-off 
home run that gave the Braves a 4-2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals 
and clinched the league championship. The team then went on to its first 
World Series win in over 40 years, defeating the New York Yankees of Berra, 
Mantle, and Ford in seven games. Burdette, the Series MVP, threw three 
complete game victories, giving up only two earned runs. In 1958, the Braves 
again won the National League pennant and jumped out to a three games to 
one lead in the World Series against New York once more, thanks in part 
to the strength of Spahn's and Burdette's pitching. But the Yankees stormed 
back to take the last three games, in large part to World Series MVP Bob 
Turley's pitching. The 1959 season saw the Braves finish the season in 
a tie with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Many residents of Chicago and Milwaukee 
were hoping for a Sox-Braves Series, as the cities are only about 75 miles 
(121 km) apart, but it was not to be because Milwaukee fell in a best-of-3 
playoff with two straight losses to the Dodgers. The Dodgers would go on 
to defeat the Chicago White Sox in the World Series. The next six years 
were up-and-down for the Braves. The 1960 season featured two no-hitters 
by Burdette and Spahn, and Milwaukee finished seven games behind the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, who ultimately were to win the World Series that year, in second 
place. The 1961 season saw a drop in the standings for the Braves down 
to fourth, despite Spahn recording his 300th victory and pitching another 
no-hitter that year. The team's attendance also started to tail off during 
this time. Aaron hit 45 home runs in 1962, a Milwaukee career high for 
him, but this did not translate into wins for the Braves, as they finished 
fifth. The next season, Aaron again hit 44 home runs and notched 130 RBI, 
and Spahn was once again the ace of the staff, going 23-7. However, none 
of the other Braves produced at that level, and the team finished in the 
lower half of the league, or "second division", for the first time in its 
short history in Milwaukee. The Braves were somewhat mediocre as the 1960s 
began, but fattened up on the expansion New York Mets and Houston Colt 
.45s. To this day, the Milwaukee Braves are the only major league team 
who played more than one season and never had a losing record. Lou Perini 
sold the Braves to a Chicago-based group led by William Bartholomay after 
the 1961 season and the ink was barely dry on the deal when Bartholomay 
started shopping the Braves to a larger television market. Keen to attract 
them, the fast-growing city of Atlanta, led by Mayor Ivan Allen, Jr., constructed 
a new $18 million, 52,007-60,606 seat multi-purpose stadium in less than 
one year, Atlanta Stadium, (later on known as Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium 
from 1976 until 1996 with its demolition in 1997) which was officially 
opened in 1965 in hopes of luring an existing Major League Baseball and/or 
NFL/AFL team. After the city failed to lure the Kansas City A's to Atlanta 
(the A's would move to Oakland in 1968), the Braves announced their intention 
to move to Atlanta for the 1965 season. However, an injunction filed in 
Wisconsin kept the Braves in Milwaukee for one final year. In 1966, the 
Braves completed the move to Atlanta. The Braves were a .500 team in their 
first few years in Atlanta – 85-77 in 1966, 77-85 in 1967, and 81-81 in 
1968. The 1967 season was the Braves' first losing season since 1952, their 
last year in Boston. In 1969, with the onset of divisional play, the Braves 
won the first-ever National League West pennant, before being swept by 
the "Miracle Mets" in the National League Championship Series. They would 
not be a factor in the next decade, posting only two winning seasons between 
1970 and 1981 – in some cases, fielding teams as bad as the worst Boston 
teams. In the meantime, fans had to be satisfied with the achievements 
of Hank Aaron. In the relatively hitter-friendly confines of Atlanta Stadium 
("The Launching Pad"), he actually increased his offensive production. 
It also produced batting champions in Rico Carty (in 1970) and in Ralph 
Garr (in 1974). By the end of the 1973 season, Aaron had hit 713 home runs, 
one short of Ruth's record. Throughout the winter he received racially 
motivated death threats, but stood up well under the pressure. The next 
season, it was only a matter of time before he set a new record. On April 
4 he hit #714 in Cincinnati, and on April 8, in front of his home fans, 
he finally beat Ruth's mark. In 1976, the team was purchased by media magnate 
Ted Turner, owner of superstation WTBS, as a means to keep the team (and 
one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta. The financially strapped 
Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as 
a down-payment. It was then that Atlanta Stadium was renamed Atlanta–Fulton 
County Stadium. Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on 
baseball owner. Turner used the Braves as a major programming draw for 
his fledgling cable network, a move that made the Braves the first Major 
League Baseball franchise to have a regular, nationwide audience and fanbase. 
WTBS marketed the team as "The Atlanta Braves: America's Team", a nickname 
that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially the South, today. 
Among other things, in 1976 Turner suggested the nickname "Channel" for 
pitcher Andy Messersmith and jersey number 17, in order to promote the 
television station that aired Braves games. Major League Baseball quickly 
vetoed the idea. On May 11, 1977, Turner appointed himself manager, but, 
because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a 
financial stake in their team, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position 
after one game (the Braves lost 2-1 to the Pittsburgh Pirates to bring 
their losing streak to 17 games). After three straight losing seasons, 
Bobby Cox was hired for his first stint as manager of the franchise for 
the 1978 season, and he promoted a 22-year-old slugger named Dale Murphy 
into the starting lineup. Murphy hit 77 home runs over the next three seasons, 
but struggled on defense, positioned at either catcher or first base while 
being unable to adeptly play either. However, in 1980, Murphy was moved 
to center field and demonstrated excellent range and throwing ability, 
while the Braves earned their first winning season since 1974. Cox was 
fired after the 1981 season and replaced with Joe Torre, under whose leadership 
the Braves attained their first divisional title since 1969. However, the 
Braves were swept by the eventual World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals 
in the NLCS. Strong performances from Bob Horner, Chris Chambliss, pitcher 
Phil Niekro, and short relief pitcher Gene Garber helped the Braves, but 
no Brave was more acclaimed than Murphy, who won both a Most Valuable Player 
and a Gold Glove award. Murphy also won a Most Valuable Player award the 
following season, but the Braves began a period of decline that defined 
the team throughout the 1980s. Murphy, excelling in defense, hitting, and 
running, was consistently recognized as one of the league's best players, 
but the Braves averaged only 65 wins per season between 1985 and 1990. 
Their lowest point came in 1988, when they lost 106 games. The 1986 season 
saw the return of Bobby Cox to the Braves organization as general manager. 
Also in 1986, the team stopped using their Native American-themed mascot, 
Chief Noc-A-Homa. Cox returned to the dugout as manager in the middle of 
the 1990 season, replacing Russ Nixon. The Braves would finish the year 
with the worst record in baseball, at 65-97, and traded Dale Murphy to 
the Philadelphia Phillies after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant 
player. However, pitching coach Leo Mazzone began developing young pitchers 
Tom Glavine, Steve Avery, and John Smoltz into future stars. That same 
year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the 1990 MLB Draft 
to select Chipper Jones, who would go on to become one of the best hitters 
in team history. Perhaps the Braves' most important move, however, was 
not on the field, but in the front office. Immediately after the season, 
John Schuerholz was hired away from the Kansas City Royals as general manager. 
The following season, Glavine, Avery, and Smoltz would be recognized as 
the best young pitchers in the league, winning 52 games among them. Meanwhile, 
behind position players Dave Justice, Ron Gant and unexpected league Most 
Valuable Player and batting champion Terry Pendleton, the Braves overcame 
a 39-40 start, winning 55 of their final 83 games over the last three months 
of the season and edging the Los Angeles Dodgers by one game in one of 
baseball history's more memorable playoff races. The "Worst to First" Braves, 
who had not won a divisional title since 1982, captivated the city of Atlanta 
(and, to a larger degree, the state of Georgia and the entire southeast) 
during their improbable run to the flag. They defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 
in a very tightly contested seven-game NLCS only to lose the World Series, 
also in seven games, to the Minnesota Twins. The series, considered by 
many to be one of the greatest ever, was the first time a team that had 
finished last in its division one year went to the World Series the next; 
both the Twins and Braves accomplished the feat. During the Braves' rise 
to prominence in the early 1990s, their long-standing ethnic nickname came 
under much closer scrutiny, even being protested in Minneapolis when the 
Braves visited the Twins for Game 1 of the 1991 World Series. The team 
was especially criticized for selling plastic and foam tomahawks, encouraging 
the so-called tomahawk chop and the accompanying war cry emitted by the 
fans. The war cry and tomahawk chop are similar, if not identical, to what 
Florida State University fans do at their games. Initially, the war chant 
music was played by the Braves' organist, but in recent years, a recording 
of the FSU band has been used instead. This tradition can be traced back 
to the arrival of former Seminole Deion Sanders, who also played for the 
NFL's Atlanta Falcons at the time (he would go on to play both sports simultaneously 
in San Francisco for one year). Despite the World Series loss, the Braves' 
success would continue. In the 1992 season, the Braves returned to the 
NLCS and once again defeated the Pirates in seven games, only to lose in 
the World Series to a dominating Toronto Blue Jays team. In 1993, the Braves 
signed Cy Young Award winning pitcher Greg Maddux from the Chicago Cubs, 
leading many baseball insiders to declare the team's pitching staff the 
best at that time. The 1993 team posted a franchise-best 104 wins after 
a dramatic pennant race with the San Francisco Giants, who won 103 games. 
The Braves needed a stunning 55-19 finish to edge out the Giants, who led 
the Braves by nine games in the standings as late as August 11. However, 
the Braves fell in the NLCS to the Philadelphia Phillies in a six-game 
upset. In 1994, in a realignment of the National League's divisions following 
the 1993 expansion, the Braves moved to the Eastern Division.[1][2] This 
realignment was the main cause of the team's heated rivalry with the New 
York Mets during the mid to late 1990s.[3][4][5] The player's strike cut 
short the 1994 season, prior to the division championships, with the Braves 
six games behind the Montreal Expos with 48 games left to play. The Braves 
returned strong the following strike-shortened (teams played 144 games 
instead of the customary 162) year and beat the Cleveland Indians in the 
World Series. This squelched claims by many Braves critics that they were 
the "Buffalo Bills of baseball" (January 1996 issue of Beckett Baseball 
Card Monthly). With this World Series victory, the Braves became the first 
team in Major League Baseball to win world championships in three different 
cities. With their strong pitching being a constant, the Braves would also 
appear in the 1996 and 1999 World Series (they lost both series to the 
New York Yankees, however), and had a streak of division titles from 1991 
to 2005 interrupted only in 1994 when the strike ended the season early. 
Pitching is not the only constant in the Braves organization – , Schuerholz 
remained the team's GM until after the 2007 season when he was promoted 
to team president. Pendleton did not finish his playing career in Atlanta, 
but has returned to the Braves system as the hitting coach. A 95-67 record 
in 2000 produced a ninth consecutive division title. However, a sweep at 
the hands of the St. Louis Cardinals prevented the Braves from reaching 
the NLCS. In 2001, Atlanta won the National League East division yet again, 
swept the NLDS against the Houston Astros, then lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks 
in the National League Championship Series four games to one. One memorable 
game the Braves played that year came on September 21, when they played 
rival New York Mets in the first major professional sporting event held 
in New York City since 9/11. In 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Braves won their 
division again, but lost in the NLDS in all three years; 3 games to 2 to 
the San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs, and 3 games to 1 to the Houston 
Astros. Six National League Cy Young Awards in the 1990s were awarded to 
three Braves pitchers: In 2005, the Braves won the Eastern Division championship 
for the eleventh consecutive year from 1995 to 2005. This followed winning 
the Western Division championship three times from 1991 to 1993, prior 
to the 1994 player's strike. The 2005 title marked the first time any MLB 
team made the postseason with more than 4 rookies who each had more than 
100 ABs (Wilson Betemit, Brian McCann, Pete Orr, Ryan Langerhans, Jeff 
Francoeur).[citation needed] Catcher Brian McCann, right fielder Jeff Francoeur, 
and pitcher Kyle Davies all grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta. The large 
number of rookies to debut in 2005 were nicknamed the "Baby Braves" by 
fans and became an Atlanta-area sensation, helping to lead the club to 
a record of 90-72. However, the season would end on a sour note as the 
Braves lost the National League Division Series to the Astros in four games. 
In Game 4, with the Braves leading by 5 in the eighth inning, the Astros 
battled back with a Lance Berkman grand slam and a two-out, ninth inning 
Brad Ausmus home run off of Braves closer Kyle Farnsworth. The game didn't 
end until the 18th inning, becoming the longest game in playoff history 
at 5 hours 50 minutes. Chris Burke ended the marathon with a home run off 
of Joey Devine. After the 2005 season, the Braves lost their long-time 
pitching coach Leo Mazzone, who left to go to the Baltimore Orioles. Roger 
McDowell took his place in the Atlanta dugout. Unable to re-sign shortstop 
Rafael Furcal, the Braves acquired shortstop Edgar Rentería from the Boston 
Red Sox. In 2006, the Braves did not perform at the level they had grown 
accustomed to. Due to an offensive slump, injuries to their starting rotation, 
and subpar bullpen performances, the Braves compiled a 6-21 record for 
the month of June, the worst month ever in the city of Atlanta, and just 
percentage points better than the Boston Braves of May 1935 (4-20). The 
Braves made their move in July, going 14-10. However, the team remained 
in the bottom half of the NL East and trailed the Mets by a double-digit 
deficit for much of the season (13 games at the all-star break). However, 
despite their struggles, the Braves entered the break down by only six 
and a half games to the Dodgers for the NL Wild Card slot after winning 
seven of their last ten games. After the break, the Braves came out with 
their bats swinging, setting many franchise records. They won five straight, 
sweeping the Padres and taking two from the Cardinals, tallying a total 
of 65 runs in that span. The 65 runs in five games is the best by the franchise 
since 1897, when the Boston Beaneaters totaled 78, including 25 in one 
game and 21 in another, from May 31-June 3; the 2006 Braves also became 
the first team since the 1930 New York Yankees to score ten runs or more 
in five straight games. The Braves had a total of 81 hits during their 
five-game run and 98 hits in their last six games, going back to an 8-3 
victory over Cincinnati on July 9, the last game before the all-star break. 
Additionally, Chipper Jones was able to maintain a 20-game hitting streak 
and tie Paul Waner's 69-year-old Major League record with a 14-game extra-base 
hit streak. (The Sporting News Baseball Record Book, 2007, p. 29) The Braves 
made their first trade of the season on July 20 to shore up the bullpen, 
sending Class A Rome catcher Max Ramirez to Cleveland for closer Bob Wickman. 
He served as the Braves' closer for the remainder of the season, taking 
over for an embattled Jorge Sosa, who was subsequently traded on the July 
31 trade deadline for St. Louis minor league pitcher Rich Scalamandre. 
On July 29, the Braves traded reserve third baseman/shortstop Wilson Betemit 
to the Los Angeles Dodgers for reliever Danys Báez and infielder Willy 
Aybar. The move came on the night that starting third baseman Chipper Jones 
went on the 15-day disabled list with a strained oblique muscle. With Betemit 
gone, Atlanta called up infielder Tony Peña Jr. from AAA Richmond to supplement 
Pete Orr. Before the expansion of rosters on September 1, the Braves acquired 
Daryle Ward from the Washington Nationals for Class A Myrtle Beach pitcher 
Luis Atilano, in hopes that he would be a valuable pinch-hitter in the 
postseason. However, on September 18, the New York Mets' win over the Florida 
Marlins mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL East, 
ending the Braves' eleven-year reign over the NL East. On September 24, 
the Braves' loss to the Colorado Rockies mathematically eliminated the 
Braves from winning the NL Wild Card, making 2006 the first year that the 
Braves would not compete in the postseason since 1990, not counting the 
strike-shortened 1994 season. Also, a loss to the Mets on September 28 
guaranteed the Braves their first losing season since 1990. Although the 
Braves won two of their last three games against the Astros, including 
rookie Chuck James besting Roger Clemens, Atlanta finished the season in 
third place, one game ahead of the Marlins, at 79-83. After the season, 
the Atlanta coaching staff underwent a few changes. Brian Snitker became 
the third base coach after Fredi González left to become the manager for 
the Florida Marlins. Chino Cadahia replaced Pat Corrales as bench coach 
and former catcher Eddie Perez became the new bullpen coach, replacing 
Bobby Dews. In December 2005, team owner Time Warner, who inherited the 
Braves after purchasing TBS in 1996, announced it was placing the team 
for sale. Liberty Media began negotiations to purchase the team. In February 
2007, after more than a year of negotiations, Time Warner agreed to a deal 
that would sell the Braves to Liberty Media Group (a company which owned 
a large amount of stock in Time Warner, Inc.), pending approval by 75 percent 
of MLB owners and the Commissioner of Baseball, Bud Selig. The deal includes 
the exchange of the Braves, and $1 billion cash, for the large block of 
Time Warner stock held by Liberty Media. Team President Terry McGuirk anticipated 
no change in the current front office structure, personnel, or day-to-day 
operations of the Braves. Liberty Media is not expected to take any type 
of "active" ownership in terms of day-to-day operations.[citation needed] 
On May 16, 2007, Major League Baseball's owners approved the sale of the 
Braves from Time Warner to Liberty Media.[6] The Braves made their first 
moves by re-signing Bob Wickman to a one-year deal and picking up John 
Smoltz's option in September 2006. Then they traded starting pitcher Horacio 
Ramírez to the Seattle Mariners for pitcher Rafael Soriano, an American 
League reliever with a solid 2.20 ERA in 2006. They also denied arbitration 
to pitcher Chris Reitsma and second baseman Marcus Giles. Then the Braves 
signed utility-man Chris Woodward to fill a spot on the bench. The biggest 
trade in the offseason involved first baseman Adam LaRoche and a minor 
league player for Pittsburgh Pirates closer Mike González and a minor league 
infielder, Brent Lillibridge. Gonzalez, who converted 24 of 24 save opportunities 
in 2006, joined Soriano as a set-up man for Wickman in the bullpen. The 
team then signed first baseman Craig Wilson to a one-year deal to platoon 
with Scott Thorman. The Braves also had solid relievers in Macay McBride, 
Blaine Boyer, and Tyler Yates. In addition, the majority of the Braves' 
offense, which was second in the NL in runs scored in 2006, returned in 
2007. However, Mike Hampton was sidelined for the entire 2007 season with 
yet another surgery. Mike González was later sidelined for the season while 
recovering from Tommy John surgery. The Braves' bullpen and offense came 
through in the clutch early on, helping the Braves to a 7-1 start, their 
best start since winning the World Series in 1995. The team finished April 
with a 16-9 record, but struggled during May, finishing 14-14. The Braves 
also struggled during interleague play, finishing with an NL-worst 4-11 
record. On June 24, the Braves fell to .500 for the first time in the 2007 
season, but rebounded by winning the next 5 games. On July 5, Chipper Jones 
surpassed Dale Murphy for the Atlanta club record of 372 home runs by belting 
two against the Los Angeles Dodgers. On July 31, 2007, the Braves finalized 
the deal to acquire slugger first baseman Mark Teixeira and LHP Ron Mahay 
from the Texas Rangers for Jarrod Saltalamacchia and four minor-leaguers.[7] 
The Braves also acquired Octavio Dotel from the Kansas City Royals for 
Kyle Davies and also traded LHP Wilfredo Ledezma and RHP Will Startup to 
the San Diego Padres for Royce Ring. On August 19, 2007 John Smoltz passed 
Phil Niekro for 1st place on the Braves' all-time strikeout list. After 
struggling during the second half of the 2007 season, Atlanta finished 
over .500 and missed the post season again. On October 12, 2007, John Schuerholz 
stepped aside from his General Manager position to take over as the team's 
president.[8] Schuerholz's former Assistant GM Frank Wren will take over 
as the new Atlanta General Manager. Wren's first major transaction was 
the announcement that the team would not re-sign center fielder Andruw 
Jones (who later would sign with the Dodgers). The second major move was 
acquiring OF Gorkys Hernández and RHP Jair Jurrjens from the Detroit Tigers 
in exchange for SS Edgar Rentería and cash considerations. His third move 
was signing LHP Tom Glavine to a one-year contract. The team's first new 
move for 2008 was acquiring OF Mark Kotsay from the A's (to replace Jones) 
in exchange for RHP Joey Devine, RHP Jamie Richmond and cash considerations. 
Days later, Wren traded Willy Aybar, outfielder Tom Lindsey, and infielder 
Chase Fontaine to the Rays in exchange for left-hand reliever Jeff Ridgway.
