The 1991 Toronto Blue Jays season was the franchise's fifteenth season 
of Major League Baseball. It resulted in the Blue Jays finishing first 
in the American League East with a record of 91 wins and 71 losses. The 
team's paid attendance of 4,001,527 led the major leagues, as the Jays 
became the first team in MLB history to draw four million fans in a season. 
Toronto lost the ALCS to the eventual world champion Minnesota Twins in 
five games. On December 4, 1990, the San Diego Padres and Blue Jays made 
one of the biggest blockbuster deals of the decade. The Padres traded second 
baseman Roberto Alomar and outfielder Joe Carter to the Blue Jays in exchange 
for first baseman Fred McGriff and shortstop Tony Fernández. Blue Jays 
GM Pat Gillick and Padres GM Joe McIlvaine originally talked about just 
trading Joe Carter for Fred McGriff.[1] The Padres were losing Jack Clark 
and needed a new first baseman. The Blue Jays had John Olerud ready to 
take over at first base but were losing outfielder George Bell. Gillick 
decided to up the ante by trying to get Alomar. Gillick figured that with 
Garry Templeton in the twilight of his career, Fernández would be an adequate 
replacement.[1] Alomar feuded with Padres manager Greg Riddoch and the 
thinking was that Bip Roberts and Joey Cora could platoon at second base.[1] 
Over the next two seasons, Alomar and Carter would help the Blue Jays win 
the 1992 World Series and 1993 World Series. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
