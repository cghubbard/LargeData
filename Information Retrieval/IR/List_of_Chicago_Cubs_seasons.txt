The following lists the results of every season of the Chicago Cubs baseball 
club of Major League Baseball beginning in 1870 and continuing to 1876 
as a charter member of the National League (NL). The White Stockings changed 
their name in 1890 to the Chicago Colts and again in 1898 to the Chicago 
Orphans until finally settling in 1903 with the name of the Chicago Cubs. 
While the organization Major League Baseball recognizes only seasons in 
select leagues from 1876 to the present as major league, many baseball 
historians consider major league baseball to have started earlier. Some 
include seasons from the National Association, and others include its predecessor 
organization, the National Association of Base Ball Players. The Chicago 
Cubs have completed 145 seasons of baseball, second only to the Atlanta 
Braves at 146. Within this time, the Cubs have won 17 National League pennants, 
3 World Series championships, 4 pre-World Series Championships, and tied 
for 2 pre-World Series Championships. By virtue of their pennants and playoff 
championships, the Cubs can claim to be the best team in baseball in nine 
different seasons. The Cubs have been members of three organized leagues, 
beginning with the amateur National Association of Base Ball Players in 
1870, followed by three seasons in the professional National Association 
of Professional Base Ball Players, and the National League since 1876. 
The following table describes the Cubs' MLB winâ€“loss record by decade.
