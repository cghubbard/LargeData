Ohio Valley Conference (primary) Missouri Valley (men's soccer) The SIU 
Edwardsville Cougars are the intercollegiate athletic teams of Southern 
Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE), located in Edwardsville, Illinois, 
United States. The Cougars' athletic program is a member of the Ohio Valley 
Conference (OVC)[2] and competes at the NCAA Division I [3] level. The 
SIUE mascot is Eddie the Cougar #57, and the school colors are red and 
white. Cougar teams have won seventeen NCAA national championships in five 
sports.[4] SIUE entered intercollegiate athletic competition during the 
1967–68 school year. At that time, college athletics was almost exclusively 
the realm of the male student athlete, but times were on the verge of change. 
On October 4, 1972, SIUE's first women's team took the field, as women's 
athletic director and coach Rosemarie Archangel's field hockey team played 
and won its first game. Field hockey has since been discontinued, and other 
sports have come and gone.[5] Until 2007, when the university began the 
transition to Division I,[6] SIUE had competed in Division II, except in 
men's soccer, which competed in Division I from 1973 through 1995. From 
1994 to 2008, the Cougars were members of the Great Lakes Valley Conference 
(GLVC) after having previously been an independent.[7] As part of the move 
to Division I, the Cougars joined the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) in 2008.[8] 
The 2011–12 season was the Cougars' first campaigns for the OVC regular 
season titles, although they were not eligible for post-season play until 
2012–13 except in softball and men's soccer, which were "fast-tracked" 
by the NCAA. A member of the Ohio Valley Conference, SIU Edwardsville sponsors 
teams in eight men's and eight women's NCAA sanctioned sports:[9] Roy Lee 
initiated the baseball program in 1967–68 and headed it for its first eleven 
years. In that time, he garnered a record of 237–144–3,[12] leading his 
teams to 8 consecutive NCAA Division II playoffs and 3 Division II College 
World Series, with a runner-up finish in 1976.[13] After Coach Lee's retirement, 
the program was led by SIUE alumnus Gary Collins. In his 34 years as the 
Cougars' coach, Collins won 1028 games (with 766 loses & 7 ties).[12] While 
still in Division II, his teams made 14 NCAA appearances and went to the 
Division II College World Series 5 times.[13] He led them into Division 
I and the Ohio Valley Conference, where the Cougars completed their first 
season in the OVC with an overall record of 27-28 and a conference record 
of 13-14, which tied for fifth place in the ten team league.[14] On July 
11, 2012, it was announced that Gary Collins would be making the transition 
from coach to the University's first Director of Development for Intercollegiate 
Athletics.[15] The following day, it was announced that, after thirteen 
seasons as Collins' assistant, SIUE alumnus Tony Stoecklin was named acting 
head coach with the opportunity to earn the permanent job,[16] and he then 
continued as the head coach.[17] In mid-April, 2016, Tony Stoecklin was 
reassigned to other duties, and Danny Jackson was named interim head coach. 
At the end of the seadon, a national search was launched to find a new 
head coach.[18] On June 16, two finalists for the job were announced: Missouri 
State assistant coach Paul Evans and Bradley associate head coach Sean 
Lyons.[19] The Cougar men's basketball program was begun as a Division 
II program in 1967 by Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame coach Harry 
Gallatin[20] who had no scholarships, inadequate facilities, and almost 
no money to work with. The program has since seen mixed success under 7 
coaches, with the most successful having been Larry Graham (147–84 with 
3 NCAA DII appearances in 8 seasons from 1984–92) and Marty Simmons (88–59, 
2 DII NCAAs in 5 seasons from 2002–07).[21] Coach Lennox Forrester was 
in charge during SIUE's move from Division II to Division I and competing 
in the Ohio Valley Conference.[22] On May 4, 2012, it was announced that, 
following steady improvement, Coach Forrester's contract had been extended 
for three more years.[23] On March 10, 2015,it was announced that, due 
to lack of success, Coach Forrester and his entire staff would not be retained.[24] 
Following a national search, it was announced on April 3, 2015 that Edwardsville 
native and California assistant Jon Harris was named the new head coach.[25] 
The Cougars' women's program first took to the court in 1974 under Ina 
Anderson. For 29 of its first 34 seasons, it was guided by Wendy Hedberg 
who amassed a record of 470–361 and led her teams into the NCAA Division 
II tournament 5 times.[26] Coach Amanda Levens was in charge during SIUE's 
move from Division II to Division I and competing in the Ohio Valley Conference.[27] 
Picked by the OVC coaches to finish eighth of the eleven teams, the women's 
Cougars finished the 2011-12 season 12-4 in the conference and in third 
place. This and their 18-11 regular season record earned them an invitation 
to the Women's Basketball Invitational (WBI) tournament[28] and earned 
OVC Women's Coach of the Year honors for Levens.[29] On April 20, 2012, 
it was announced that Levens had resigned to accept the position of associate 
head coach at Arizona State University, her alma mater.[30] On June 13, 
2012, it was announced that Bradley University head coach Paula Buscher 
had been named the new SIUE women's head coach.[31] SIUE's men's cross 
country team initiated competition in the Fall of 1968, winning its first 
dual meet.[32] The men's outdoor track and field team began a year later, 
coached by Jack Whitted and lost its first meet.[32] And so did the programs 
muddle through for many years, with highs, lows, and a number of shining 
successes along the way. When SIUE began to emphasize excellence in its 
athletic programs as much as in academics, the track and field program 
came of age. Between 2004 and 2008, when the move to Division I began, 
SIUE became an NCAA Division II powerhouse. In that short span, 16 men 
won 36 All-American awards,[33] yet they were overshadowed by the Cougar 
women, with 15 winning 70 All-American certificates and capturing 6 individual 
National Championships.[34] Current coach Eileen McAllister (XC) and former 
coach Kareem Jackson (T&F) and have not yet seen that level of success 
in Division I, but their athletes have toppled school records with regularity.[35][36][37][38] 
On September 17, 2013, it was announced that Jackson had followed his predecessor, 
David Astrauskas, to also become an assistant coach at Wisconsin, and that 
McAllister would be the interim head track and field coach, as well as 
the head cross country coach.[39] At the end of the 2015 school year, with 
"interim" no longer on the Cougar's webpage,[40] McAllister stepped down 
to focus on her family. SIUE alumnus and assistant coach Scott Block was 
named as interim head coach.[41] In the 2013 outdoor season, long jumper 
La'Derrick Ward became the first Cougar athlete to qualify for the NCAA 
Division I Outdoor Championships.[42] In the 2014 indoor season, both and 
triple jumper Jatavia Wright qualified for the NCAA championships, giving 
the Cougars representation in both the men's and women's competitions. 
On March 14, Ward finished 6th in the men's long jump and became SIUE's 
first Division I Track and Field All-American.[43] The following day, Wright 
finished 11th in the women's triple jump and earned a spot on the All American 
second team.[44][45] For the 2014 outdoor season, Ward, Wright, and sprinter 
Braxton Klavins qualified for the NCAA championships, again giving the 
Cougars representation in both the men's and women's competitions. On June 
11, Klavins finished 16th in the 400 meters, earning 2nd team All-American 
status.[46] On the 12th, Ward placed 4th in the long jump, earning his 
second 1st team All-American certificate.[47] On the 13th, Wright moved 
up from the 24th qualifier to 18th in the women's triple jump, just missing 
a repeat as 2nd team All-American but earning honorable mention on the 
All-America lists.[48] All three were juniors and are eligible again in 
2015.[49] Bill Brick started the men's golf program in the spring of 1968. 
Although he had quick success, he soon left to further his own education.[50] 
He was replaced by SIUE's first athletic director and basketball coach, 
Harry Gallatin, who remained at the program's helm for 24 years,[20] leading 
his teams to the NCAA DII championships 19 times--- including 6 top 10 
finishes.[51] Fourteen of his golfers earned 22 All-American awards or 
honorable mentions. Soon after Gallatin's retirement, the university decided 
to discontinue the program. In 2005–06, the program was resurrected, with 
funding raised by friends and alumni, following the example of the support 
for the wrestling program (see below).[52] SIUE alumni Mark Marcuzzo and 
Kyle Viehl, who had both played for Gallatin, were appointed head coach 
and associate.[53] Marcuzzo left after that first season, replaced by Vielh 
who led the program into DI competition. When Viehl departed in 2010, he 
was replaced by current coach Derrick Brown.[54] Larry Bennett began the 
women's program in 1998–99. The team qualified to compete in the NCAA Division 
II East Regional five times, 2002–06.[55] Jennifer Jakel was its 3rd coach 
from '06-07, leading the program into Division I and the Ohio Valley Conference, 
until leaving in July, 2013.[56] On June 24, 2013, ground was broken for 
a new golf training facility. It is to be named the Harry Gallatin Golf 
Training Facility.[57] On July 29, 2013, men's coach Derrick Brown was 
named Director of Golf, making him the head coach of both the men's and 
the women's programs.[58] On February 28, 2016, Brad Hewitt, SIUE director 
of athletics announced that, as a result of the ongoing state of Illinois 
budget crisis, the Intercollegiate Athletics Committee needed to reduce 
the Department of Athletics budget by $200,000. To accomplish this.the 
man's tennis and women's golf teams would be eliminated.[59] National Soccer 
Hall of Fame coach Bob Guelker came to SIUE in 1966 to start the men's 
soccer program. He had previously also begun the program at St. Louis University, 
where his teams won 5 NCAA titles, including the very first in 1959.[60] 
As coach of the Cougars, he led them for 19 seasons, compiling a record 
of 216–67–21 and winning the very first Division II title in 1972 and the 
Division I championship in 1979 in their 14 NCAA tournament appearances.[61] 
Coach Guelker was succeeded by Ed Huneke, who remained for 22 seasons, 
building a record of 251–155–34 with 7 NCAA tourney appearances. In the 
mid-1990s SIUE had reluctantly moved from Division I to Division II, yet 
the move heralded a return to the NCAAs, including 3 Semifinals and a Division 
II runner-up finish.[62] From 2007 through 2013, the program was headed 
by Kevin Kalish, who led it back into Division I, including competition 
in the Missouri Valley Conference.[63] On December 6, 2013, Scott Donnelly, 
Associate Head Coach since 2012, was named as the Cougars' fourth head 
coach. After leading the Cougars to an undefeated spring exhibition season, 
it was announced less than three weeks before the start of the 2014 regular 
season that Donnelly had been recruited away to a position with the U.S. 
Soccer Federation. He was replaced by seventh year goalkeepers coach Brian 
Jones and first year assistant coach David Korn, who were named co-head 
coaches.[64] After a rough start to the season, the Cougars finished the 
MVC regular season as the runnerup to Missouri State. They then beat Bradley 
and Missouri State in the MVC Tournament, for the school's first MVC title 
and a spot in the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship for the first 
time since 1982[65] and advanced to the second round.[66] Through 48 seasons, 
the men's teams have a record of 524–277–73.[67] Following a nationwide 
search by a committee that had former head coaches Kevin Kalish and David 
Korn as consultants, on January 27, 2015 Mario Sanchez, the associate head 
coach of the Louisville Cardinals was introduced as the Cougars fifth head 
coach.[68] Begun in 1982, the women's program has been a consistent winner 
under 7 head coaches (or coaching combos), who have garnered a record of 
331–209–50, with 5 appearances in the Division II NCAA playoffs and one 
in Division I.[69][70] The program is currently headed by Derek Burton, 
who has taken it into Division I in the Ohio Valley Conference.[71] The 
2014 women's squad tied for the OVC regular season title, earning the #2 
seed in the conference tournament.[72] After trailing 5th seed Jacksonville 
State 2–0 in the championship game, the Cougars scored two late goals to 
tie, then won in extra time to advance to SIUE's first NCAA Division I 
Women's Soccer Championship.[73] At Lexington, the Cougars played Kentucky 
to a scoreless draw despite being heavily overmatched, but fell in a shootout 
4–2 and ended the season with a record of 13–6–2.[74] The SIUE softball 
program, has seen only 2 head coaches in its history. Cindy Jones (376–201, 
1975–88) and Sandy Montgomery (957–480–2 since 1989) have combined for 
a record of 1333-681-2 record through 2015, with 13 NCAA Division II appearances 
and one in Division I. In 2007, SIUE won their last sixteen consecutive 
games of the season en route to the NCAA Division II softball championship, 
where they defeated Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania 3–2 in 12 innings 
(the longest championship game in history).[75] The 2011 Cougars completed 
their first full season of Ohio Valley Conference play with an overall 
record of 28-30 and an OVC record of 19-11, which took seventh place in 
the eleven team league, qualifying the Cougars for their first OVC Tournament.[76] 
The 2014 Cougars became the first SIUE team to win an OVC championship, 
beating the Murray State Racers 12-1 in six innings at Jacksonville, Alabama 
on May 10, also qualifying for the 2014 NCAA Division I Softball Tournament.[77] 
Unlike some of the other coaches who started up Cougar sports programs, 
Kent DeMars at least had scholarships to offer when he began the men's 
tennis program in 1973–74. With these, he was able to put Cougar tennis 
on the map in short order, finishing 2nd in NCAA Division II in the team's 
first year of eligibility. This was followed by seven (7) consecutive DII 
National Championships. Bob Meyers inaugurated the women's program in 1979–80 
and found almost as much rapid success as DeMars, winning the first of 
four (4) consecutive NCAA DII Championships in 1986. In 1986, Meyers also 
became head coach of the men's team, following DeMars' departure, and both 
teams have since mostly shared one coaching staff. Since coach Meyer's 
departure following the '89 women's title, the programs have seen mixed 
success and have not approached the success of the championship years. 
Jason Coomer, the 8th coach for both the men's and women's teams has overseen 
the move to Division I and the Ohio Valley Conference and became men's 
coach only when Pratzel was promoted.[78] On May 6, 2014, after four years 
as assistant coach, Amanda Pratzel was promoted to head coach of the women's 
team, with Coomer retaining leadership of the men's team.[79] In the season 
which had just ended, both teams qualified as the fourth seed for its first 
OVC tournament.[80] In August 2015, Praetzel became the latest SIUE coach 
to be hired away by her sport's governing body, when she accepted the position 
as the United States Tennis Association's Missouri Valley Youth Pathway 
Manager the USTA's Kansas City office.[81] Nick Mueller, the head women's 
coach at the University of Evansville was announced as the new SIUE women's 
coach on August 25, 2015.[82] On February 28, 2016, Brad Hewitt, SIUE director 
of athletics announced that, as a result of the ongoing state of Illinois 
budget crisis, the Intercollegiate Athletics Committee needed to reduce 
the Department of Athletics budget by $200,000. To accomplish this.the 
man's tennis and women's golf teams would be eliminated.[59] Sandy Montgomery 
began the volleyball program in 1995 and coached for its first four years, 
guiding it to a record of 83–54 and its first appearance in the NCAA Division 
II tournament in 1998. Todd Gober led the program for a decade, with a 
record of 205–112 and 3 NCAA appearances in 2005–07 before beginning the 
transition to Division I. Leah Johnson became SIUE's 4th volleyball coach 
in 2011 as it began competition in the Ohio Valley Conference.[83] Larry 
Kristoff started the SIUE wrestling program in 1969 with resources similar 
to those available to soccer coach Bob Guelker, basketball coach Harry 
Gallatin, and baseball coach Roy Lee--- next to none. He quickly developed 
one of the dominant Division II programs. In 30 seasons, his teams were 
consistently top competitors and won back-to-back-to-back NCAA Division 
II championships in 1984–86 and were runners-up in 1975 and 1987. Kristoff's 
program was initially unaffected when the university de-emphasized athletics 
in the mid-1980s, but went into decline after its championship years when 
the recruiting budget was repeatedly decreased despite the program's success. 
Following the 2002–03 season, the SIUE administration decided to eliminate 
the wrestling program. A number of staunch supporters and alumni formed 
the Friends of Wrestling that has since raised monies from sources outside 
the university to maintain the program.[84] David Ray, the 4th coach since 
Kristoff's retirement was in charge as the program made the move to Division 
I and competition in the Southern Conference (the OVC does not sponsor 
wrestling) until it was announced on April 12, 2013 that he had tendered 
his resignation to accept a position in the university's administration. 
On July 19, 2013, after a nationwide search, Cornell assistant coach Jeremy 
Spates, who had mentored Kyle Dake, Cornell's four-time national champion 
and the NCAA's 2013 Most Outstanding Wrestler, was named the new Cougar 
coach.[85] At the conclusion of Spates' first season, senior David Devine 
won the Southern Conference heavyweight championship, becoming the first 
Cougar wrestler to advance to the NCAA National Championships since SIUE's 
move to Division I.[86] In 2015, two Cougar wrestlers won SoCon titles, 
advancing to Nationals. Jake Tindle earned SIUE's first championship point 
as a Division I program after a win in the NCAA Tournament.[87] As indicated 
in some of the prior sections. intercollegiate athletics at SIUE mostly 
began with very little in the way of funding. Although the programs competed 
in Division II from their beginnings, it was not until 1973, the year after 
the school had won its first NCAA championship, that the SIU Board of Trustees 
authorized the granting of 114 athletic scholarships and an additional 
28 tuition waivers. Up until that time, the athletic department had only 
been able to offer about 50 student activity grants, while the Salukis 
at SIU Carbondale had 220 full NCAA scholarships.[88] During the 1970s 
and early '80s the SIUE Cougars were extremely successful in several sports, 
winning multiple NCAA championships in men's soccer, wrestling, and both 
men's and women's tennis. In 1983, it was discovered that two men's tennis 
players who were both All-Americans and NCAA champions were "majoring in 
tennis" and neglecting to attend classes.[89] It further came to light 
that the men's basketball coach had violated a number of the NCAA's restrictions 
on recruiting. While the tennis program was able to defend its string of 
NCAA Division II championships by winning their seventh title in a row 
in 1984, the university took the almost unprecedented action of suspending 
the men's basketball program for the 1983-84 season. Additionally, the 
athletic director was assigned to other duties within the university, with 
other actions against him held in abeyance, as he was a tenured faculty 
member. After these events, the university severely reduced funding to 
all athletics, and the overall program went into a period of decline. The 
following are among the athletic facilities used by SIUE Cougar teams:[90] 
In August 2002, Assistant Vice Chancellor for University Relations Dr. 
Bradley Hewitt, an SIUE administrator since 1989, was appointed Director 
of Intercollegiate Athletics, the 7th in the school's history. With his 
appointment, Dr. Hewitt was assigned the twofold task of returning SIUE 
athletics to the glory of the 1970s & 80's, when the Cougars won 16 NCAA 
championships, and expanding that success through the entire spectrum of 
the university's athletic program. During the first six years of his term, 
SIUE sent Cougar teams or individual athletes to 48 NCAA Division II championship 
competitions. The Cougars earned 3 top-15 finishes in the U.S. Sports Academy 
Directors' Cup, and they twice won both the GLVC All-Sports Trophy and 
the Commissioner's Cup. And... in 2007, the softball team won the NCAA 
Division II National Championship--- SIUe's first national title since 
1989. In the Fall of 2007, Dr. Hewitt was assigned new tasks--- preparing 
Cougar athletics for entry into NCAA Division I competition and arranging 
for affiliation with a Division I athletic conference. The softball and 
men's soccer were able to be "fast-tracked" into Division I competition, 
with all other sports becoming full members of Division I in the Fall of 
2012. Membership was secured for all but 2 teams in the Ohio Valley Conference 
in July 2008;[8] in November 2008, the men's soccer team gained associate 
membership in the Missouri Valley Conference;[10] in June 2011, the wrestling 
team was accepted as an associate member of the Southern Conference.[11] 
A 1981 mathematics graduate of Central Missouri State University (now the 
University of Central Missouri), Hewitt also earned his master's degree 
in athletic administration from CMSU in 1982 and received his Ph.D. in 
education from Southern Illinois University Carbondale in 1994; he is also 
a 2006 executive management graduate of the Sports Management Institute. 
Prior to coming to SIUE, he was an athletic administrator and coach at 
Morningside College (Iowa), SIUC, and CMSU. At SIUE, Dr Hewitt has served 
as an assistant athletic director, acting CEO of the SIUE Foundation, acting 
Vice Chancellor of University Relations, adjunct professor in Kinesiology 
and Health Education, acting Alumni Director, as well as his current double-duty 
of Assistant Vice Chancellor for University Relations and Director of Intercollegiate 
Athletics.[106] As proud as he is of SIUE's athletic success, Dr. Hewitt 
is even more proud of its academic success. Concerning the Cougars' Spring 
of 2016 achievements and the program's ten straight years of academic excellence, 
he said,"This is an incredible feat that is rarely duplicated anywhere 
in the country. It's always the reflection of the institution's support 
of Intercollegiate Athletics and its academic endeavors. It is a reflection 
of our entire staff, specifically our head coaches for recruiting quality 
student-athletes committed to getting degrees and being successful.” In 
the Spring of 2016, SIUE student-athletes recorded a combined 3.252 grade 
point average (GPA), the second highest ever following the previous semester's 
3.258 . This marked the 20th consecutive semester that the Cougar student-athletes 
posted a combined GPA of greater than 3.0. The volleyball team finished 
with the highest team GPA with a 3.643. They were followed by women’s cross 
country (3.610), softball (3.574), women’s golf (3.543), men's tennis (3.538), 
men's cross country (3.457), wonen's track and field (3.374), men's track 
and field (3.365), women's tennis (3.364), men’s golf (3.281), men’s soccer 
(3.271), women’s soccer (3.117), and baseball (3.057).[107] On June 12, 
2013, the NCAA's Academic Progress Rate (APR) report (based on cumulative 
progress from 2008-09 through 2011-12) showed that fifteen SIUE programs 
outperformed the national average. Eight teams led their sport in the Ohio 
Valley Conference (more than for any other OVC school), and wrestling was 
second in the Southern Conference. Eight teams led their sport in the Ohio 
Valley Conference (more than for any other OVC school), and wrestling was 
second in the Southern Conference. Additionally, four programs (men’s cross 
country, women’s soccer, softball, and women’s tennis) were honored by 
the NCAA for recording a perfect 1000 in the multiyear APR scores.[108] 
Three SIUE teams were given public recognition awards by the NCAA in 2014 
for top academic performance. The men’s cross country, women’s tennis, 
and women’s soccer teams were honored for scoring in the top 10% nationally 
on the APRs. Dr, Hewitt commented that, "This success is a reflection of 
the daily efforts and support of the student-athletes and departments on 
campus, including Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, Intercollegiate Athletics, 
and faculty and staff members who provide services."[109] The men’s cross 
country and women’s tennis teams were again given recognition in 2015."[110] 
In the NCAA's Graduate Success Rate (GSR) rankings, SIUE had eight programs 
rated at 100% and ranked #2 in the OVC (behind Belmont), in the Top 25 
of all public institutions, and in the top third of all schools nationally.[111][112][113] 
The cougar was chosen as the university mascot[114] in 1967, before any 
SIUE athletic teams ever took the field. In February 1968, through the 
efforts of the Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity, the university acquired 
a young cougar that had been born at the San Diego Zoo the previous August 
and adopted by Thomas Blackshear. The cub, named Danie, was donated to 
SIUE by Blackshear's mother, Mrs. Nonette Lewis, following his untimely 
death. A “Name the Cougar” contest was held to rename the cub, and Mary 
Ann Kucinick won with the name, Chimega--- the Apache word for cougar. 
Chimega, possessed of a warm and patient personality, soon became the university's 
beloved mascot. She resided in a large cage just to the south of the University 
Center that was topped with a geodesic dome designed by visiting professor 
R. Buckminster Fuller. She was cared for by a student organization aptly 
named the Cougar Guard, who accompanied her on her twice-daily walks around 
the core campus and to a myriad of university activities, especially including 
athletic events. (In keeping with the times, the Cougar Guard was originally 
all-male, but eventually became co-ed.) Chimega mated in 1974 and bore 
two cubs, one stillborn, the second dying within hours. In the summer of 
1982, having become less patient with people than she had always been, 
Chimega was retired from active mascot service. She died in March 1985 
and was buried near the pond located east of the classroom building now 
known as Founder's Hall. In January, 1983, a second cougar, seven-month-old 
Kyna--- Welsh for wise or graceful lady--- became SIUE's second live mascot. 
Chimega's cage had been divided in two and a large, caged run would later 
be added. At one time, Kyna was released by pranksters/vandals. Later, 
she had severe health issues after eating a soccer ball. Due to liability 
insurance issues, she was restricted from interacting with the public in 
late 1986. Then, in June, 1987, the university administration, without 
consulting students, staff, or alumni, donated Kyna to an exotic animal 
park. Despite protests, Kyna did not return, and SIUe has since been without 
a live cougar mascot. In 2007, the university unveiled the bronze cougar 
statue[115] in front of the Morris University Center, "a monument" to commemorate 
Chimega and Kyna. In January 2010, Eddie the Cougar[116] made his first 
appearance as the costumed SIUE mascot, replacing Corey the Cougar. Eddie 
has since made appearance at many campus events, wearing number 57, which 
commemorates SIUE's founding in 1957. The Southern Illinois University 
Edwardsville Fight Song is "Mighty Cougar Roar." [117] SIUE Music Department 
faculty members Dr. Kim Archer (composition) and Dr. Darryl Coan (music 
education) composed the song after SIUE entered Division I. It was introduced
