Michael Anthony "Mike" Napoli (born October 31, 1981) is an American professional 
baseball first baseman who is currently a free agent. Previously a catcher, 
he has played in Major League Baseball for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, 
Boston Red Sox, Texas Rangers, and Cleveland Indians. Born in Hollywood, 
Florida, Napoli attended Charles W. Flanagan High School in Pembroke Pines, 
Florida. Another notable Flanagan High alumnus is current Detroit Tigers 
outfielder J.D. Martinez. Napoli was drafted out of high school by the 
Anaheim Angels in the 17th round (500th overall) of the 2000 Major League 
Baseball Draft. Napoli began his professional career with the rookie-level 
Butte Copper Kings, but sat out most of the year after suffering a lower 
back strain. He returned in 2001 with the High-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes 
before transferring to Single-A Cedar Rapids. In 2002, he returned to Cedar 
Rapids, hitting .251 with 10 home runs and 50 RBI as the Kernels' primary 
designated hitter. He also started at catcher for 37 games. After being 
transferred to Rancho Cucamonga in 2003, Napoli only played 47 games after 
injuring his right shoulder. In 2004 Napoli hit .282 with 29 home runs 
and 118 RBI, ranking seventh in RBI and ninth in walks in all of the minor 
leagues. In 2005, Napoli was promoted to Double-A Arkansas, finishing second 
in the league in extra-base hits and fifth in runs scored. Napoli played 
for the Águilas Cibaeñas of Santiago in the Dominican Republic during the 
winters of 2004 and 2005. Napoli made his Major League Baseball debut on 
May 4, 2006, against the Detroit Tigers in Comerica Park, and proceeded 
to hit a home-run in his first Major League at-bat off starting pitcher 
Justin Verlander. With solid offensive and defensive numbers, Napoli worked 
his way to become the Angels' regular starting catcher. In 2006, Napoli 
hit .228 with 16 home runs in only 268 at-bats. Napoli began 2007 as the 
Opening Day starting catcher, and split time with José Molina through the 
first half of the season. The second half of the season was injury-marred 
for Napoli, as he suffered a sprained ankle on a game-winning play at the 
plate during the final game before the All-Star break, causing him to miss 
12 games. He then suffered a strained hamstring only 5 games after returning, 
causing him to miss all of August as a result. For the season, Napoli ended 
up batting .247 with 10 home runs, despite appearing in only 75 games. 
Napoli again was the Angels Opening Day starter at catcher, and after fully 
recovering from his 2007 injuries, began the 2008 season on a torrid pace, 
belting 6 home runs in the month of April. Despite his impressive hitting 
performances, Napoli continued to share time behind the plate with Jeff 
Mathis, who had assumed the back-up duties after the Angels trade of Molina 
during the 2007 season. Unfortunately, the injury bug bit Napoli again 
in July, causing him to miss 28 games with shoulder issues. However, after 
fully recovering from the injury, Napoli exploded down the stretch, leading 
all of Major League Baseball with a .457 batting average in the month of 
September. For the season, Napoli tallied a .273 batting average and 20 
home runs, both career highs. Napoli also amassed an incredible .960 OPS 
(On-base + Slugging percentage), which would have placed him in the top 
5 in the American League in that category, had he accumulated enough at-bats 
to qualify for the league leaders. Napoli's production helped the Angels 
win the 2008 American League West Division championship, with an impressive 
100–62 record. Napoli also posted one of the greatest individual post-season 
performances in Angels history during the 2008 American League Divisional 
Series against the Boston Red Sox in Fenway Park. In Game 3 of the series, 
with the Red Sox holding a 2–0 series lead, Napoli unloaded 2 mammoth home 
runs against Red Sox Starting Pitcher Josh Beckett, helping extend the 
game into extra innings. He then singled and scored the game-winning run 
in the 11th inning, preventing the Red Sox from sweeping the series. Napoli 
continued to compete with Jeff Mathis for the leading catcher spot in 2009. 
He also started 18 games at designated hitter as teammate Vladimir Guerrero 
could not fulfill that role because of an injury. Still, despite his platooning 
of playing time with Mathis, Napoli continued to thrive at the plate. In 
his first injury-free season since his rookie year, Napoli set or matched 
career highs in virtually every offensive category, including games played 
(114), at bats (382), runs scored (60), hits (104), doubles (22), and Runs 
Batted In (56). He also finished the season with a .272 Batting Average 
and again hit 20 home runs for the second season in a row. On defense, 
he led AL catchers in errors, with 8.[1] In 2010, Napoli's role at DH seemed 
to be reduced as the Angels signed Japanese slugger Hideki Matsui.[2] He 
went into spring training with a bigger glove and worked on fundamentals 
in hopes of getting more playing time as a catcher.[3] However, Napoli 
wound up playing the majority of the 2010 season at first base. He made 
his first major league start at first base on May 30, after regular first 
baseman Kendrys Morales broke his lower leg in a walk-off celebration. 
With the loss of Morales for the season, and the return of fellow catcher 
Jeff Mathis from the disabled list, Napoli started 70 games at first base, 
posting a .989 Fielding Percentage. Napoli set career highs in several 
categories, most notably home runs (26). He was 7th in the AL in strikeouts 
(137), in 453 at bats.[1] Napoli also became the Angels all-time leader 
in home runs by a catcher during the 2010 season.[4] On January 21, Napoli 
was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays along with outfielder Juan Rivera in 
exchange for outfielder Vernon Wells.[5] Four days later, he was traded 
by the Blue Jays to the Texas Rangers in exchange for pitcher Frank Francisco.[6] 
On May 29, he was involved in a controversial game-ending play at home 
plate in the ninth inning in a game against the Kansas City Royals. Napoli 
was at first and Elvis Andrus was up against Joakim Soria. Andrus hit a 
shot past Eric Hosmer that got into right field. Napoli was sent home by 
the third-base coach. Hosmer threw the ball to the plate. Brayan Pena tagged 
Napoli on the upper shoulder, but Napoli was called safe by the home-plate 
umpire, giving the Rangers a walk-off win. Pena was enraged and arguing 
with the umpires with manager Ned Yost. Replays showed that Pena did not 
block the plate, but tagged Napoli, who got his feet in just before the 
tag. In his first season with the Rangers he batted .320 with 30 home runs 
(10th in the American League) and 75 RBIs, while improving his defense 
(throwing out 36% of base-stealers; 4th-best in the league).[1] He had 
a .631 slugging percentage in 369 at bats.[1] In Game 5 of the 2011 World 
Series, he hit a two-run double in the bottom of the eighth inning to give 
the Rangers a 4-2 lead. The Rangers held on to win and take a 3-games-to-2 
lead in the series, though they eventually lost the World Series Championship 
to the St. Louis Cardinals in 7 games. On February 11, 2012, Napoli signed 
a one-year, $9.4 million deal to avoid arbitration with the Rangers. Napoli 
filed for $11.5 million, but the Rangers countered with $8.3 million. He 
received the second highest raise for anyone in their third or fourth time 
through the arbitration process, with Prince Fielder taking the top spot. 
He became a free agent after the season.[7] On December 3, 2012, Napoli 
agreed to a three-year, $39 million deal with the Boston Red Sox, pending 
a physical examination.[8] Following a six-week period during which the 
status of the deal was in question after his physical showed signs of a 
hip issue,[9] Napoli came to terms with the Red Sox on a one-year, $5 million 
deal with incentives that could make the deal worth $13 million. The incentives 
were to stay on the active roster for at least 165 days (which Napoli achieved), 
or get up to 625 plate appearances with at least 120 days on the roster.[10][11] 
On April 22, 2013, Napoli hit his fourth career grand slam off of A. J. 
Griffin in a 9-6 win over the Oakland Athletics. At one point of the season, 
Napoli was tied for second in RBIs with Detroit Tigers first baseman Prince 
Fielder.[12] On September 15, 2013, Napoli struck out for the 178th time 
of the season, passing Mark Bellhorn to be the new Red Sox franchise leader 
in strikeouts in a season. Upon his franchise-breaking strikeout, Napoli 
threw his bat and helmet in frustration and argued with home plate umpire 
Ron Kulpa and was ejected for the first time in his Major League career. 
For the 2013 season, Napoli batted .259 with 23 home runs, 92 RBI, and 
struck out 187 times that set a new Red Sox season record. In Game 3 of 
the 2013 ALCS against the Detroit Tigers, Napoli hit a solo home run off 
Justin Verlander for the game's only run in a 1-0 Boston win.[13] Although 
Napoli played more games at catcher than at any other position in each 
of his seasons with the Angels and Rangers, he did not catch a single game 
for the Red Sox in 2013, playing the field entirely at first base with 
a few games as a designated hitter.[1] During Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 
2013 World Series, with the DH rule not in effect per National League rules, 
regular DH David Ortiz played first base and Napoli was taken out of the 
lineup rather than moved to catcher.[1] After 6 games against the St. Louis 
Cardinals, Napoli got his first career championship ring as the Red Sox 
won their 8th World Series pennant. He agreed to re-sign with the Red Sox 
on a two-year deal worth $32 million on December 6, 2013.[14] During 2014, 
Napoli dealt with injuries throughout the season. Napoli broke his finger 
in an early season game vs the Chicago White Sox. Napoli returned, but 
finger problems and sleep apnea took him out of the lineup for much of 
the late season. Napoli struggled in 98 games for the Red Sox in 2015, 
hitting just .207 with 98 strikeouts, 13 HRs, and 40 RBIs. On August 7, 
2015, the Texas Rangers acquired Napoli and cash considerations from the 
Red Sox for a player to be named later.[15] Manager Jeff Banister used 
Napoli against left-handed pitching and played him in left field.[citation 
needed] He played 35 games for the Rangers in 2015, making 91 plate appearances 
and batting .295 with five home runs, 10 RBI and a .513 SLG. On January 
5, 2016, Napoli signed a one-year, $7 million contract with the Cleveland 
Indians.[16] During the season, Streetsboro, Ohio resident Nate Crowe coined 
the popular phrase "Party at Napoli's", creating a t-shirt with the slogan 
that was gifted to Napoli. Upon wearing the shirt during a post-game interview, 
demand for the shirts was high. Subsequent sales of the shirt have raised 
over $200,000 for the Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital.[17] Napoli 
batted .239 while setting career highs with 34 home runs and 101 RBIs.[18] 
In game three of the 2016 American League Championship Series, Napoli's 
home run off of Blue Jays starting pitcher Marcus Stroman made him the 
fifth player to hit a postseason home run for four different teams, joining
