Walter Henry Ruether (born in Alameda, California; September 29, 1893 – 
May 16, 1970) was an American baseball player who pitched for five different 
Major League teams. In his 11-year career, Ruether played for the Chicago 
Cubs, the Cincinnati Reds, the Brooklyn Robins, the Washington Senators, 
and the New York Yankees. He appeared in the 1919 World Series with the 
Reds, in the 1925 World Series with the Senators, and in the 1926 World 
Series with the Yankees. Ruether was also a member of the 1927 Yankees. 
Though that team played in the 1927 World Series, Ruether did not participate 
in any of the games. Ruether attended St. Ignatius College.[1] On March 
10, 1913, St. Ignatius participated in an exhibition game against the Chicago 
White Sox. Ruether, a left-hander, pitched in the game for St. Ignatius. 
In the ninth-inning, White Sox shortstop Buck Weaver hit a 3-run home run 
off Ruether. This secured the victory for the White Sox, and Ruether lost 
the contest 4–2.[1][2] Ruether parlayed his strong outing into a try-out 
with the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League. After reporting to 
Hot Springs, Arkansas for the Pirates' training camp, he signed a contract. 
The contract stated that Ruether could opt out if the Pirates attempted 
to assign him to a Minor league farm team.[1] The Pirates did just that, 
and consequently, Ruether left the organization. After he left the Pirates, 
Ruether went to play in the Northwest League. He spent the 1914 season 
and the 1915 season with the Vancouver Beavers.[3] In 1916, Ruether moved 
to the Spokane Indians. That team went on to win the pennant.[1] In 1917, 
Ruether signed with the Chicago Cubs. He made his Major League debut in 
April of that year. After he had appeared in 10 games for the Cubs, the 
Cincinnati Reds selected Ruether off waivers on July 17, 1917.[4] After 
finishing the 1917 season, Ruether enlisted in the United States Army due 
to the break out of World War I. He reported to Camp Lewis.[1] In 1919, 
Ruether rejoined the Reds. He won nineteen games that season and the Reds 
made the 1919 World Series. Though Cincinnati won the series, it has become 
infamous for the Black Sox Scandal. Ruether spent the 1920 season with 
the Reds. On December 15 of that year, the Reds traded Ruether to the Brooklyn 
Robins in exchange for Rube Marquard.[4] He spent the next four seasons 
as a pitcher for the Robins. During the 1924 season, Ruether suffered from 
arm problems. After an apparent dispute with Charles Ebbets, the Robins 
owner, the Washington Senators purchased Ruether from the Robins.[1] Ruether 
spent the next year and a half with the Senators before the team traded 
him to the New York Yankees on August 27, 1926[4] While with the Senators, 
Ruether appeared in the 1925 World Series. Although he was a pitcher, Ruether 
did not pitch in the series. Instead, he was used as a pinch hitter and 
recorded one at-bat. For his career, Ruether was a good hitting pitcher 
with a .258 batting average and 250 career hits. The Yankees earned a spot 
in the 1926 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, and Ruether pitched 
in game three. The game did not go well for Ruether. The Cardinals won 
4–0. In 1927, Ruether played for his third consecutive pennant winning 
team. However, Ruether did not appear in the 1927 World Series. The 1927 
season was his last in the Major Leagues. Ruether recorded 137 wins and 
95 losses, for a .591 winning percentage. Ruether holds the National League 
record for most innings pitched in a season opening game. On opening day 
1923, he pitched 14-innings for the Robins. Ruether left the Yankees after 
the 1927 championship and then pitched in the Pacific Coast League until 
1933. In 1934, Ruether retired from active play and joined the Seattle 
Indians as the team manager. The league voted Ruether the All-star team 
manager in his first year.[1] Ruether left the league in 1936. Later in 
his life, Ruether served as a scout for the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco 
Giants. He helped discover players such as Joey Amalfitano, Eddie Bressoud, 
Peanuts Lowrey and Mike McCormick.[1] Ruether died in Phoenix, Arizona
