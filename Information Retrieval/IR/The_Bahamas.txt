Bahamas (i/bəˈhɑːməz/), officially the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, is 
an archipelagic state of the Lucayan Archipelago consisting of more than 
700 islands, cays, and islets in the Atlantic Ocean; north of Cuba and 
Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic); northwest of the Turks and 
Caicos Islands; southeast of the US state of Florida and east of the Florida 
Keys. Its capital is Nassau on the island of New Providence. The designation 
of "The Bahamas" can refer to either the country or the larger island chain 
that it shares with the Turks and Caicos Islands. As stated in the mandate/manifesto 
of the Royal Bahamas Defence Force, the Bahamas territory encompasses 470,000 km2 
(180,000 sq mi) of ocean space. The Bahamas were the site of Columbus' 
first landfall in the New World in 1492. At that time, the islands were 
inhabited by the Lucayan, a branch of the Arawakan-speaking Taino people. 
Although the Spanish never colonised the Bahamas, they shipped the native 
Lucayans to slavery in Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 
1513 until 1648, when English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island 
of Eleuthera. The Bahamas became a British Crown colony in 1718, when the 
British clamped down on piracy. After the American War of Independence, 
the Crown resettled thousands of American Loyalists in the Bahamas; they 
brought their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants. 
Africans constituted the majority of the population from this period. The 
Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves: the Royal Navy resettled 
Africans here liberated from illegal slave ships; American slaves and Seminoles 
escaped here from Florida; and the government freed American slaves carried 
on United States domestic ships that had reached the Bahamas due to weather. 
Slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Today the descendants of 
slaves and free Africans make up nearly 90% of the population; issues related 
to the slavery years are part of society. The Bahamas became an independent 
Commonwealth realm in 1973, retaining Queen Elizabeth II as its monarch. 
In terms of gross domestic product per capita, the Bahamas is one of the 
richest countries in the Americas (following the United States and Canada), 
with an economy based on tourism and finance.[9] The name Bahamas is derived 
from either the Taino ba ha ma ("big upper middle land"), which was a term 
for the region used by the indigenous Amerindians,[10] or from the Spanish 
baja mar ("shallow water or sea" or "low tide") reflecting the shallow 
waters of the area. Alternatively it may originate from Guanahani, a local 
name of unclear meaning.[11] In English, the Bahamas is one of only two 
countries whose self-standing short name begins with the word "the", along 
with The Gambia.[12] Taino people moved into the uninhabited southern Bahamas 
from Hispaniola and Cuba around the 11th century, having migrated there 
from South America. They came to be known as the Lucayan people. An estimated 
30,000 Lucayan inhabited the Bahamas at the time of Christopher Columbus' 
arrival in 1492. Columbus's first landfall in the New World was on an island 
he named San Salvador (known to the Lucayan as Guanahani). Some researchers 
believe this site to be present-day San Salvador Island (formerly known 
as Watling's Island), situated in the southeastern Bahamas. An alternative 
theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on Samana Cay, according 
to calculations made in 1986 by National Geographic writer and editor Joseph 
Judge, based on Columbus's log. Evidence in support of this remains inconclusive. 
On the landfall island, Columbus made first contact with the Lucayan and 
exchanged goods with them. The Spanish forced much of the Lucayan population 
to Hispaniola for use as forced labour. The slaves suffered from harsh 
conditions and most died from contracting diseases to which they had no 
immunity; half of the Taino died from smallpox alone.[14] The population 
of the Bahamas was severely diminished.[15] In 1648, the Eleutherian Adventurers, 
led by William Sayle, migrated from Bermuda. These English Puritans established 
the first permanent European settlement on an island which they named Eleuthera—the 
name derives from the Greek word for freedom. They later settled New Providence, 
naming it Sayle's Island after one of their leaders. To survive, the settlers 
salvaged goods from wrecks. In 1670 King Charles II granted the islands 
to the Lords Proprietors of the Carolinas in North America. They rented 
the islands from the king with rights of trading, tax, appointing governors, 
and administering the country.[16] In 1684 Spanish corsair Juan de Alcon 
raided the capital, Charles Town (later renamed Nassau). In 1703 a joint 
Franco-Spanish expedition briefly occupied the Bahamian capital during 
the War of the Spanish Succession. During proprietary rule, the Bahamas 
became a haven for pirates, including the infamous Blackbeard (c.1680–1718). 
To put an end to the 'Pirates' republic' and restore orderly government, 
Britain made the Bahamas a crown colony in 1718 under the royal governorship 
of Woodes Rogers. After a difficult struggle, he succeeded in suppressing 
piracy.[17] In 1720, Rogers led local militia to drive off a Spanish attack. 
During the American War of Independence in the late 18th century, the islands 
became a target for American naval forces under the command of Commodore 
Esek Hopkins. US Marines occupied the capital of Nassau for a fortnight. 
In 1782, following the British defeat at Yorktown, a Spanish fleet appeared 
off the coast of Nassau. The city surrendered without a fight. Spain returned 
possession of the Bahamas to Britain the following year, under the terms 
of the Treaty of Paris. Before the news was received, however, the islands 
were recaptured by a small British force led by Andrew Deveaux. After American 
independence, the British resettled some 7,300 Loyalists with their slaves 
in the Bahamas, and granted land to the planters to help compensate for 
losses on the continent. These Loyalists, who included Deveaux, established 
plantations on several islands and became a political force in the capital. 
European Americans were outnumbered by the African-American slaves they 
brought with them, and ethnic Europeans remained a minority in the territory. 
In 1807, the British abolished the slave trade, followed by the United 
States the next year. During the following decades, the Royal Navy intercepted 
the trade; they resettled in the Bahamas thousands of Africans liberated 
from slave ships. In the 1820s during the period of the Seminole Wars in 
Florida, hundreds of American slaves and African Seminoles escaped from 
Cape Florida to the Bahamas. They settled mostly on northwest Andros Island, 
where they developed the village of Red Bays. From eyewitness accounts, 
300 escaped in a mass flight in 1823, aided by Bahamians in 27 sloops, 
with others using canoes for the journey. This was commemorated in 2004 
by a large sign at Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park.[18][19] Some of 
their descendants in Red Bays continue African Seminole traditions in basket 
making and grave marking.[20] The United States' National Park Service, 
which administers the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, 
is working with the African Bahamian Museum and Research Center (ABAC) 
in Nassau on development to identify Red Bays as a site related to American 
slaves' search for freedom. The museum has researched and documented the 
African Seminoles' escape from southern Florida. It plans to develop interpretive 
programs at historical sites in Red Bay associated with the period of their 
settlement in the Bahamas.[21] In 1818,[22] the Home Office in London had 
ruled that "any slave brought to the Bahamas from outside the British West 
Indies would be manumitted." This led to a total of nearly 300 slaves owned 
by US nationals being freed from 1830 to 1835.[23] The American slave ships 
Comet and Encomium used in the United States domestic coastwise slave trade, 
were wrecked off Abaco Island in December 1830 and February 1834, respectively. 
When wreckers took the masters, passengers and slaves into Nassau, customs 
officers seized the slaves and British colonial officials freed them, over 
the protests of the Americans. There were 165 slaves on the Comet and 48 
on the Encomium. Britain finally paid an indemnity to the United States 
in those two cases in 1855, under the Treaty of Claims of 1853, which settled 
several compensation cases between the two nations.[24][25] Slavery was 
abolished in the British Empire on 1 August 1834. After that British colonial 
officials freed 78 American slaves from the Enterprise, which went into 
Bermuda in 1835; and 38 from the Hermosa, which wrecked off Abaco Island 
in 1840.[26] The most notable case was that of the Creole in 1841: as a 
result of a slave revolt on board, the leaders ordered the American brig 
to Nassau. It was carrying 135 slaves from Virginia destined for sale in 
New Orleans. The Bahamian officials freed the 128 slaves who chose to stay 
in the islands. The Creole case has been described as the "most successful 
slave revolt in U.S. history".[27] These incidents, in which a total of 
447 slaves belonging to US nationals were freed from 1830 to 1842, increased 
tension between the United States and Great Britain. They had been co-operating 
in patrols to suppress the international slave trade. But, worried about 
the stability of its large domestic slave trade and its value, the United 
States argued that Britain should not treat its domestic ships that came 
to its colonial ports under duress, as part of the international trade. 
The United States worried that the success of the Creole slaves in gaining 
freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant ships. In August 
1940, after his abdication of the British throne, the Duke of Windsor was 
installed as Governor of the Bahamas, arriving with his wife, the Duchess. 
Although disheartened at the condition of Government House, they "tried 
to make the best of a bad situation".[28] He did not enjoy the position, 
and referred to the islands as "a third-class British colony".[29] He opened 
the small local parliament on 29 October 1940. The couple visited the "Out 
Islands" that November, on Axel Wenner-Gren's yacht, which caused controversy;[30] 
the British Foreign Office strenuously objected because they had been advised 
(mistakenly) by United States intelligence that Wenner-Gren was a close 
friend of the Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring of Nazi Germany.[30][31] 
The Duke was praised at the time for his efforts to combat poverty on the 
islands. A 1991 biography by Philip Ziegler, however, described him as 
contemptuous of the Bahamians and other non-white peoples of the Empire. 
He was praised for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in Nassau 
in June 1942, when there was a "full-scale riot."[32] Ziegler said that 
the Duke blamed the trouble on "mischief makers – communists" and "men 
of Central European Jewish descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for 
obtaining a deferment of draft".[33] The Duke resigned the post on 16 March 
1945.[34][35] Modern political development began after the Second World 
War. The first political parties were formed in the 1950s. The British 
Parliament authorised the islands as internally self-governing in 1964, 
with Sir Roland Symonette, of the United Bahamian Party, as the first Premier. 
A new constitution granting the Bahamas internal autonomy went into effect 
on 7 January 1964.[36] In 1967, Lynden Pindling of the Progressive Liberal 
Party, became the first black Premier of the majority-black colony; in 
1968 the title of the position was changed to Prime Minister. In 1968, 
Pindling announced that the Bahamas would seek full independence.[37] A 
new constitution giving the Bahamas increased control over its own affairs 
was adopted in 1968.[38] The British House of Lords voted to give the Bahamas 
its independence on 22 June 1973.[39] Prince Charles delivered the official 
documents to Prime Minister Lynden Pindling, officially declaring the Bahamas 
a fully independent nation on 10 July 1973.[40] It joined the Commonwealth 
of Nations on the same day.[41] Sir Milo Butler was appointed the first 
Governor-General of the Bahamas (the official representative of Queen Elizabeth 
II) shortly after independence. The Bahamas joined the International Monetary 
Fund and the World Bank on 22 August 1973,[42] and it joined the United 
Nations on 18 September 1973.[43] Based on the twin pillars of tourism 
and offshore finance, the Bahamian economy has prospered since the 1950s. 
Significant challenges in areas such as education, health care, housing, 
international narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration from Haiti 
continue to be issues. The College of the Bahamas is the national higher 
education/tertiary system. Offering baccalaureate, masters and associate 
degrees, COB has three campuses, and teaching and research centres throughout 
the Bahamas. COB is on track to become the national "University of The 
Bahamas" (UOB) in 2015. The country lies between latitudes 20° and 28°N, 
and longitudes 72° and 80°W. In 1864, the Governor of the Bahamas reported 
that there were 29 islands, 661 cays, and 2,387 rocks in the colony.[44] 
The closest island to the United States is Bimini, which is also known 
as the gateway to the Bahamas. The island of Abaco is to the east of Grand 
Bahama. The southeasternmost island is Inagua. The largest island is Andros 
Island. Other inhabited islands include Eleuthera, Cat Island, Long Island, 
San Salvador Island, Acklins, Crooked Island, Exuma, Berry Islands and 
Mayaguana. Nassau, capital city of the Bahamas, lies on the island of New 
Providence. All the islands are low and flat, with ridges that usually 
rise no more than 15 to 20 m (49 to 66 ft). The highest point in the country 
is Mount Alvernia (formerly Como Hill) on Cat Island. It has an elevation 
of 63 metres (207 ft). To the southeast, the Turks and Caicos Islands, 
and three more extensive submarine features called Mouchoir Bank, Silver 
Bank and Navidad Bank, are geographically a continuation of the Bahamas. 
The climate of the Bahamas is tropical savannah climate or Aw according 
to Köppen climate classification. As such, there has never been a frost 
or freeze reported in the Bahamas, although every few decades low temperatures 
can fall into the 3–5 °C (37–41 °F) range for a few hours when a severe 
cold outbreak comes off the North American landmass. Otherwise, the low 
latitude, warm tropical Gulf Stream, and low elevation give the Bahamas 
a warm and winterless climate. There is only an 8 °C difference between 
the warmest month and coolest month in most of the Bahama islands. As with 
most tropical climates, seasonal rainfall follows the sun, and summer is 
the wettest season. The Bahamas are often sunny and dry for long periods 
of time, and average more than 3,000 hours or 340 days[45] of sunlight 
annually. Tropical storms and hurricanes affect the Bahamas. In 1992, Hurricane 
Andrew passed over the northern portions of the islands, and Hurricane 
Floyd passed near the eastern portions of the islands in 1999. 73 °F 73 °F

is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy headed by Queen Elizabeth II 
in her role as Queen of the Bahamas. Political and legal traditions closely 
follow those of the United Kingdom and the Westminster system. The Bahamas 
is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations as a Commonwealth realm, retaining 
the Queen as head of state (represented by a Governor-General). Legislative 
power is vested in a bicameral parliament, which consists of a 38-member 
House of Assembly (the lower house), with members elected from single-member 
districts, and a 16-member Senate, with members appointed by the Governor-General, 
including nine on the advice of the Prime Minister, four on the advice 
of the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, and three on the advice 
of the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition. 
The House of Assembly carries out all major legislative functions. As under 
the Westminster system, the Prime Minister may dissolve Parliament and 
call a general election at any time within a five-year term.[48] The Prime 
Minister is the head of government and is the leader of the party with 
the most seats in the House of Assembly. Executive power is exercised by 
the Cabinet, selected by the Prime Minister and drawn from his supporters 
in the House of Assembly. The current Governor-General is Dame Marguerite 
Pindling, and the current Prime Minister is The Rt. Hon. Perry Christie, 
P.C., M.P.. Constitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, 
worship, movement and association. The judiciary is independent of the 
executive and the legislature. Jurisprudence is based on English law. The 
Bahamas has a two-party system dominated by the centre-left Progressive 
Liberal Party and the centre-right Free National Movement. A handful of 
splinter parties have been unable to win election to parliament. These 
parties have included the Bahamas Democratic Movement, the Coalition for 
Democratic Reform, Bahamian Nationalist Party and the Democratic National 
Alliance. The Bahamas has strong bilateral relationships with the United 
States and the United Kingdom, represented by an ambassador in Washington 
and High Commissioner in London. The Bahamas also associates closely with 
other nations of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Its military is the 
Royal Bahamas Defence Force (the RBDF), the navy of the Bahamas which includes 
a land unit called Commando Squadron (Regiment) and an Air Wing (Air Force). 
Under the Defence Act, the RBDF has been mandated, in the name of the Queen, 
to defend the Bahamas, protect its territorial integrity, patrol its waters, 
provide assistance and relief in times of disaster, maintain order in conjunction 
with the law enforcement agencies of the Bahamas, and carry out any such 
duties as determined by the National Security Council. The Defence Force 
is also a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)'s Regional Security 
Task Force. The RBDF came into existence on 31 March 1980. Their duties 
include defending the Bahamas, stopping drug smuggling, illegal immigration 
and poaching, and providing assistance to mariners. The Defence Force has 
a fleet of 26 coastal and inshore patrol craft along with 3 aircraft and 
over 1,100 personnel including 65 officers and 74 women. The districts 
of the Bahamas provide a system of local government everywhere except New 
Providence (which holds 70% of the national population), whose affairs 
are handled directly by the central government. In 1996, the Bahamian Parliament 
passed the "Local Government Act" to facilitate the establishment of Family 
Island Administrators, Local Government Districts, Local District Councillors 
and Local Town Committees for the various island communities. The overall 
goal of this act is to allow the various elected leaders to govern and 
oversee the affairs of their respective districts without the interference 
of Central Government. In total, there are 32 districts, with elections 
being held every five years. There are 110 Councillors and 281 Town Committee 
members are elected to represent the various districts.[49] Each Councillor 
or Town Committee member is responsible for the proper use of public funds 
for the maintenance and development of their constituency. The Bahamas 
uses drive-on-the-Left traffic rules throughout the Commonwealth. The districts 
other than New Providence are: The colours embodied in the design of the 
Bahamian flag symbolise the image and aspirations of the people of the 
Bahamas; the design reflects aspects of the natural environment (sun, sand 
and sea) and the economic and social development. The flag is a black equilateral 
triangle against the mast, superimposed on a horizontal background made 
up of two colours on three equal stripes of aquamarine, gold and aquamarine. 
The symbolism of the flag is as follows: Black, a strong colour, represents 
the vigour and force of a united people, the triangle pointing towards 
the body of the flag represents the enterprise and determination of the 
Bahamian people to develop and possess the rich resources of sun and sea 
symbolised by gold and aquamarine respectively. In reference to the representation 
of the people with the colour black, some white Bahamians have joked that 
they are represented in the thread which "holds it all together."[50] There 
are rules on how to use the flag for certain events. For a funeral the 
national flag should be draped over the coffin covering the top completely 
but not covering the bearers. The black triangle on the flag should be 
placed over the head of the deceased in the coffin. The flag will remain 
on the coffin throughout the whole service and removed right before lowered 
into the grave. Upon removal of the flag it should be folded with dignity 
and put away. The black triangle should never be displayed pointing upwards 
or from the viewer's right. This would be a sign of distress.[51] The coat 
of arms of the Bahamas contains a shield with the national symbols as its 
focal point. The shield is supported by a marlin and a flamingo, which 
are the national animals of the Bahamas. The flamingo is located on the 
land, and the marlin on the sea, indicating the geography of the islands. 
On top of the shield is a conch shell, which represents the varied marine 
life of the island chain. The conch shell rests on a helmet. Below this 
is the actual shield, the main symbol of which is a ship representing the 
Santa María of Christopher Columbus, shown sailing beneath the sun. Along 
the bottom, below the shield appears a banner upon which is the national 
motto:[52] "Forward, Upward, Onward Together." The yellow elder was chosen 
as the national flower of the Bahamas because it is native to the Bahama 
islands, and it blooms throughout the year. Selection of the yellow elder 
over many other flowers was made through the combined popular vote of members 
of all four of New Providence's garden clubs of the 1970s—the Nassau Garden 
Club, the Carver Garden Club, the International Garden Club and the Y.W.C.A. 
Garden Club. They reasoned that other flowers grown there—such as the bougainvillea, 
hibiscus and poinciana—had already been chosen as the national flowers 
of other countries. The yellow elder, on the other hand, was unclaimed 
by other countries (although it is now also the national flower of the 
United States Virgin Islands) and also the yellow elder is native to the 
family islands.[53] By the terms of GDP per capita, the Bahamas is one 
of the richest countries in the Americas.[54] The Bahamas relies on tourism 
to generate most of its economic activity. Tourism as an industry not only 
accounts for over 60% of the Bahamian GDP, but provides jobs for more than 
half the country's workforce.[55] The Bahamas attracted 5.8 million visitors 
in 2012, more than 70% of which were cruise visitors. After tourism, the 
next most important economic sector is banking and international financial 
services, accounting for some 15% of GDP. The government has adopted incentives 
to encourage foreign financial business, and further banking and finance 
reforms are in progress. The government plans to merge the regulatory functions 
of key financial institutions, including the Central Bank of the Bahamas 
(CBB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.[citation needed] The 
Central Bank administers restrictions and controls on capital and money 
market instruments. The Bahamas International Securities Exchange consists 
of 19 listed public companies. Reflecting the relative soundness of the 
banking system (mostly populated by Canadian banks), the impact of the 
global financial crisis on the financial sector has been limited.[citation 
needed] The economy has a very competitive tax regime. The government derives 
its revenue from import tariffs, VAT, licence fees, property and stamp 
taxes, but there is no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, or 
wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits and amount to 
3.9% paid by the employee and 5.9% paid by the employer.[56] In 2010, overall 
tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 17.2%.[5] Agriculture is the third 
largest sector of the Bahamian economy, representing 5–7% of total GDP. 
An estimated 80% of the Bahamian food supply is imported. Major crops include 
onions, okra, and tomatoes, oranges, grapefruit, cucumbers, sugar cane, 
lemons, limes and sweet potatoes. The Bahamas has an estimated population 
of 392,718, of which 25.9% are under 14, 67.2% 15 to 64 and 6.9% over 65. 
It has a population growth rate of 0.925% (2010), with a birth rate of 
17.81/1,000 population, death rate of 9.35/1,000, and net migration rate 
of −2.13 migrant(s)/1,000 population.[57] The infant mortality rate is 
23.21 deaths/1,000 live births. Residents have a life expectancy at birth 
of 69.87 years: 73.49 years for females, 66.32 years for males. The total 
fertility rate is 2.0 children born/woman (2010).[5] The most populous 
islands are New Providence, where Nassau, the capital and largest city, 
is located;[58] and Grand Bahama, home to the second largest city of Freeport.[59] 
According to the 99% response rate obtained from the race question on the 
2010 Census questionnaire, 91% of the population identified themselves 
as being Africans or Afro-Bahamian, 5% Europeans or Euro-Bahamian and 2% 
of a mixed race (African and European). Three centuries prior, in 1722 
when the first official census of The Bahamas was taken, 74% of the population 
was White and 26% Black.[60] Afro-Bahamians are Bahamian nationals whose 
primary ancestry was based in West Africa. The first Africans to arrive 
to the Bahamas were freed slaves from Bermuda; they arrived with the Eleutheran 
Adventurers looking for new lives. Since the colonial era of plantations, 
Africans or Afro-Bahamians have been the largest ethnic group in the Bahamas; 
in the 21st century, they account for some 91% of the country's population.[60] 
The Haitian community is also largely of African descent and numbers about 
80,000. Because of an extremely high immigration of Haitians to the Bahamas, 
the Bahamian government started deporting illegal Haitian immigrants to 
their homeland in late 2014.[61] 16,598 (5%) of the total population are 
descendants of Europeans or European Bahamians at the 2010 census.[1] European 
Bahamians, or Bahamians of European and mixed European descent form the 
largest minority, and are mainly the descendants of the English Puritans 
looking to flee religious persecution in England and American Loyalists 
escaping the American Revolution who arrived in 1649 and 1783, respectively.[62] 
Many Southern Loyalists went to the Abaco Islands, half of whose population 
was of European descent as of 1985.[63] A small portion of the Euro-Bahamian 
population is descended from Greek labourers who came to help develop the 
sponging industry in the 1900s. They make up less than 1% of the nation's 
population, but have still preserved their distinct Greek Bahamian culture. 
The official language of the Bahamas is English. Many residents speak the 
Bahamian dialect.[64] According to 1995 estimates 98.2% of the adult population 
is literate. According to International Religious Freedom Report 2008 prepared 
by United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, the islands' 
population is predominantly Christian. Protestant denominations are widespread 
with Baptists representing 35% of the population, Anglicans 15%, Pentecostals 
8%, Church of God 5%, Seventh-day Adventists 5% and Methodists 4%, but 
there is also a significant Roman Catholic community accounting for about 
14%.[65] There are also smaller communities of Jews, Muslims, Baha'is, 
Hindus, Rastafarians and practitioners of Obeah. In the less developed 
outer islands (or Family Islands), handicrafts include basketry made from 
palm fronds. This material, commonly called "straw", is plaited into hats 
and bags that are popular tourist items. Another use is for so-called "Voodoo 
dolls", even though such dolls are the result of the American imagination 
and not based on historic fact.[66] A form of folk magic (obeah) is practiced 
by some Bahamians, mainly in the Family Islands (out-islands) of the Bahamas.[67] 
The practice of obeah is illegal in the Bahamas and punishable by law.[68] 
Junkanoo is a traditional Afro-Bahamian street parade of 'rushing', music, 
dance and art held in Nassau (and a few other settlements) every Boxing 
Day and New Year's Day. Junkanoo is also used to celebrate other holidays 
and events such as Emancipation Day. Regattas are important social events 
in many family island settlements. They usually feature one or more days 
of sailing by old-fashioned work boats, as well as an onshore festival. 
Many dishes are associated with Bahamian cuisine, which reflects Caribbean, 
African and European influences. Some settlements have festivals associated 
with the traditional crop or food of that area, such as the "Pineapple 
Fest" in Gregory Town, Eleuthera or the "Crab Fest" on Andros. Other significant 
traditions include story telling. Bahamians have created a rich literature 
of poetry, short stories, plays and short fictional works. Common themes 
in these works are (1) an awareness of change, (2) a striving for sophistication, 
(3) a search for identity, (4) nostalgia for the old ways and (5) an appreciation 
of beauty. Some contributing writers are Susan Wallace, Percival Miller, 
Robert Johnson, Raymond Brown, O.M. Smith, William Johnson, Eddie Minnis 
and Winston Saunders.[69][70] Bahamas culture is rich with beliefs, traditions, 
folklore and legend. The most well-known folklore and legends in the Bahamas 
includes Lusca in Andros Bahamas, Pretty Molly on Exuma Bahamas, the Chickcharnies 
of Andro Bahamas, and the Lost City of Atlantis on Bimini Bahamas. Sport 
is a significant part of Bahamian culture. The national sport is Cricket. 
Cricket has been played in the Bahamas from 1846.[71] It is the oldest 
sport being played in the country today. The Bahamas Cricket Association 
was formed in 1936 as an organised body. From the 1940s to the 1970s, cricket 
was played amongst many Bahamians. Bahamas is not a part of the West Indies 
Board, so players are not eligible to play for the West Indies cricket 
team. The late 1970s saw the game begin to decline in the country as teachers, 
who had previously come from the United Kingdom with a passion for cricket 
were replaced by teachers who had been trained in the United States. The 
Bahamian Physical education teachers had no knowledge of the game and instead 
taught track & field, basketball, baseball, softball,[72] volleyball[73] 
and football[74] where primary and high schools compete against each other. 
Today cricket is still enjoyed by a few locals and immigrants in the country 
usually from Jamaica, Guyana, Haiti and Barbados. Cricket is played on 
Saturdays and Sundays at Windsor Park and Haynes Oval. The only other sporting 
event that began before cricket was horse racing, which started in 1796. 
The most popular spectator sports are those imported from United States 
such as basketball,[75] American football[76] and baseball[77] rather than 
Great Britain due to the country's close proximity to the United States. 
Unlike their other Caribbean counterparts, cricket has proven to be more 
popular. Dexter Cambridge, Rick Fox and Ian Lockhart are a few Bahamians 
who joined Bahamian Mychal Thompson of the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA 
ranks,[78] and Buddy Hield is expected to join this group in 2016.[79] 
Over the years American football has become much more popular than association 
football, though not implemented in the high school system yet. Leagues 
for teens and adults have been developed by the Bahamas American Football 
Federation.[80] However association football, commonly known as 'soccer' 
in the country, is still a very popular sport amongst high school pupils. 
Leagues are governed by the Bahamas Football Association. Recently the 
Bahamian government has been working closely with Tottenham Hotspur of 
London to promote the sport in the country as well as promoting the Bahamas 
in the European market. In 2013 'Spurs' became the first Premier League 
club to play an exhibition match in the Bahamas to face the Jamaica national 
football team. Joe Lewis the owner of the Tottenham Hotspur club is based 
in the Bahamas.[81] Other popular sports are swimming,[82] tennis[83] and 
boxing[84] where Bahamians have enjoyed some level of success at the international 
level. Other sports such as golf,[85] rugby league,[86] rugby union[87] 
and beach soccer[88] are considered growing sports. Athletics commonly 
known as track and field in the country is the most successful sport by 
far amongst Bahamians. Bahamians have a strong tradition in the sprints 
and jumps. Track and field is probably the most popular spectator sport 
in the country next to basketball due to their success over the years. 
Triathlons are gaining popularity in Nassau and the Family Islands. Bahamians 
have gone on to win numerous track and field medals at the Olympic Games, 
IAAF World Championships in Athletics, Commonwealth Games and Pan American 
Games. Frank Rutherford is the first athletics olympic medalist for the 
country. He won a bronze medal for triple jump during the 1992 Summer Olympics.[89] 
Pauline Davis-Thompson, Debbie Ferguson, Chandra Sturrup, Savatheda Fynes 
and Eldece Clarke-Lewis teamed up for the first athletics Olympic Gold 
medal for the country when they won the 4 × 100 m relay at the 2000 Summer 
Olympics. They are affectionately known as the "Golden Girls".[90] Tonique 
Williams-Darling became the first athletics individual Olympic gold medalist 
when she won the 400m sprint in 2004 Summer Olympics.[91] In 2007, with 
the disqualification of Marion Jones, Pauline Davis-Thompson was advanced 
to the gold medal position in the 200 metres at the 2000 Olympics, predating 
William-Darling. Click on a coloured area to see an article about English
