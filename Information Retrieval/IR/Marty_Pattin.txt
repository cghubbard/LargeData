Martin William "Marty" Pattin (born April 6, 1943) is an American former 
Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher. He pitched for the California 
Angels (1968), Seattle Pilots (1969), Milwaukee Brewers (1970–1971), Boston 
Red Sox (1972–1973), and the Kansas City Royals (1974–1980). During a 13-year 
baseball career, Pattin compiled 114 wins, 1,179 strikeouts, and a 3.62 
earned run average. He had a pitching motion that resembled Denny McLain 
with a high leg kick. Pattin was born in Charleston, Illinois and earned 
his bachelor's and master's degrees at Eastern Illinois University. A member 
of the EIU Panthers baseball team, he struck out 22 batters in a game. 
He joined the California Angels in 1968 and then was part of the Seattle 
Pilots in 1969, which later became the Milwaukee Brewers in 1970. In Milwaukee, 
Pattin finished with a 14–12 record and a 3.39 ERA in 1970, and was named 
an All-Star in 1971, when he finished with a 14–14 record and a 3.12 ERA. 
At the end of the season, he was sent to the Boston Red Sox in a 10-player 
mega-trade that included Ken Brett, Billy Conigliaro, Tommy Harper, Jim 
Lonborg and George Scott. He won 32 games in two seasons with the Red Sox, 
including a no-hit bid foiled in 1972, when A's Reggie Jackson hit a single 
off him with one out in the ninth inning. According to fellow pitcher Bill 
"Spaceman" Lee, Pattin had a habit of throwing up after the first inning 
of nearly every game he pitched with the Red Sox. Sent to the Kansas City 
Royals in exchange for Dick Drago in 1974, Pattin divided his playing time 
between starting and relieving. He was named American League pitcher of 
the month twice during the 1975 campaign, in June as a starter and in September 
as a reliever. He retired after being granted free agency following 1980 
season. After Pattin's retirement as a player, he remained involved with 
the sport as a coach. He was the head coach of the University of Kansas 
baseball team from 1982–1987.[1] There is a bar called Marty's just off
