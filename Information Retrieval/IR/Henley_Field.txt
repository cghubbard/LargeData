Henley Field is a historic site in Lakeland, Florida. Built in 1922, it 
is located at 1125 North Florida Avenue. Clare Henley, for whom the park 
was named in 1942, encouraged its construction in an effort to persuade 
a professional baseball team to train there. On May 23, 1997, it was added 
to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The ballpark was renovated 
prior to the 2002 season at a cost of $250,000. Henley was renovated to 
enable the Lakeland Tigers to play at the historic ballpark during the 
2002 season.[1] while their home field, Joker Marchant Stadium (which is 
also the current spring training home of the Detroit Tigers), was renovated 
during the 2002 season. Henley Field was used as the home ballpark of the 
fictional Class D Tampico Stogies in the 1987 HBO movie Long Gone which 
starred William Petersen and Virginia Madsen. During the film the stadium 
was known as Smythe Field.[2] On September 2, 2015, the City of Lakeland 
announced it would sell Henley Field for $1 million to United Methodist 
Church-affiliated Florida Southern College, whose baseball team have used 
the park for the past 55 years.[3] As happened in 2002, the Lakeland Flying 
Tigers (Advanced-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers) played at Henley Field 
for the duration of their 2016 season due to the renovation of nearby Joker 
Marchant Stadium. View of the grandstand View of the field Media related
