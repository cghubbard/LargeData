The 1942 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 60th season in the history 
of the franchise. The team, managed by Hans Lobert, began their fifth season 
at Shibe Park. Prior to the season, the team shortened the team nickname 
to 'Phils'. Of the change, a baseball writer opined prior to the season, 
"the gag is they wanted to get the 'lie' out of their name."[1] [1] [2]
