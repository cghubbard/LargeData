Giovanni Luis Soto (born May 18, 1991) is a Puerto Rican professional baseball 
pitcher in the Chicago White Sox organization. Soto attended Advanced Central 
College High School in Carolina, Puerto Rico. The Detroit Tigers selected 
Soto in the 21st round of the 2009 MLB draft. In 2010, the Tigers traded 
Soto to the Cleveland Indians for Jhonny Peralta.[1] On July 15, 2012, 
while playing for the Akron Aeros, Soto pitched a no-hitter against the
