Julio César Franco Robles (born August 23, 1958)[note 1] is a former professional 
baseball player and coach who is a hitting coach for the farm team of the 
Lotte Giants of the Korean Baseball Organization. He spent most of his 
playing career in Major League Baseball (MLB), entering the major leagues 
in 1982 and last appearing in 2007, when he was the oldest active MLB player. 
During that stretch, he also spent two seasons playing professional baseball 
in Japan and one season playing in the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO). 
While Franco was an All-Star and posted above-average hitting statistics 
throughout his career, he is best known for being the oldest regular position 
player in MLB history. Franco was the all-time hits leader among Dominican-born 
players until surpassed in 2011 by Vladimir Guerrero. He made his MLB debut 
as a shortstop for the Philadelphia Phillies. During his long career, Franco 
saw significant time as a shortstop, second baseman, first baseman, and 
designated hitter. Franco was born in Hato Mayor in the Dominican Republic. 
As a child, he lived in Consuelo, San Pedro de Macorís, a poor municipality 
50 miles east of Santo Domingo.[1] He attended Divine Providence School 
in Consuelo.[2] Signed by the Philadelphia Phillies organization in 1978, 
Franco reported to the Rookie-level Butte Copper Kings. In each of five 
minor league seasons, Franco hit for a batting average of at least .300. 
He was promoted through the Philadelphia minor league system each year, 
reaching the Class AAA Oklahoma City 89ers in 1982 and batting .300 and 
hitting 21 home runs in 120 games.[3] Franco debuted in the major leagues 
in 1982, playing 16 games for the Phillies. That December, Franco was part 
of a five-for-one trade between the Phillies and the Cleveland Indians. 
The Phillies received highly regarded prospect Von Hayes in exchange for 
Manny Trillo, George Vukovich, Jay Baller, Jerry Willard, and Franco.[2] 
In June 1986, Franco received a two-game suspension from the Indians after 
he arrived at the ballpark but then left before the game started. Indians 
manager Pat Corrales said that Franco left due to a personal problem, but 
he said that Franco had left without permission and that he had already 
been given a warning after missing a game in 1985.[4] Franco hit over .300 
in every season from 1986 to 1989. He also averaged over 20 stolen bases 
per season from 1983 through 1991. When he switched from shortstop to second 
base in 1988, he won four straight Silver Slugger Awards. Franco batted 
with a long whip-like swing with the heaviest bat allowed. Because of his 
batting style, Franco twice led the American League in grounding into double 
plays and was in the top-ten in that category seven times in the 1980s. 
He is seventh on the all-time list in ground-ball double plays and has 
just over 300.[5] In December 1988, during baseball's Winter Meetings, 
Franco was traded from Cleveland to the Texas Rangers, who were in need 
of an everyday second baseman. The Rangers gave up first baseman Pete O'Brien, 
and two prospects, Oddibe McDowell and Jerry Browne. The Rangers had acquired 
first baseman Rafael Palmeiro the day before, and The New York Times said 
that the Rangers' lineup might allow Franco to bat fifth, a batting order 
slot that could increase his number of runs batted in (RBI).[6] With Texas, 
Franco was named to all three of his All-Star teams: in 1989, 1990 and 
1991, and he won the Major League Baseball All-Star Game MVP Award in 1990. 
In the 1990 All-Star game, Franco came to bat in the 7th inning against 
Rob Dibble of the Cincinnati Reds. Franco drove a 101 mph fastball to the 
right-center field fence for a double, scoring the only runs of the game. 
In 1991, Franco had his only 200-hit season and won the American League 
batting title. His .341 average was nine points higher than that of future 
Baseball Hall of Fame member Wade Boggs.[citation needed] A 1992 knee injury 
limited him to 35 games and ended Franco's time as a middle infielder.[citation 
needed] Franco later said that the injury helped him to realize the importance 
of taking care of his physical condition.[7] He spent 1993 as a designated 
hitter before opting to become a free agent and signing with the Chicago 
White Sox. In 1994, Franco had already hit 20 home runs for the only time 
in his career and was on pace to reach 100 runs batted in for the only 
time in his career when the remainder of the season was canceled by the 
1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. On December 28, 1994, Franco signed 
to play in Japan with the Chiba Lotte Marines in the Pacific League. Chiba 
Lotte had the best season in its history in 1995, and Franco won the Japanese 
equivalent of the Gold Glove Award as a first baseman. After the 1995 season 
in Japan, Franco signed with the Cleveland Indians, where he was a fan 
favorite. In 1996, he batted .322 with 76 RBIs even in an injury-shortened 
season, and played in his first postseason. Early in the 1997 season, Franco 
hit a hard line drive back to the pitcher's mound which struck Detroit 
Tigers pitcher Willie Blair; the pitcher missed four weeks of the season 
with a broken jaw.[8] In August 1997, the Indians released Franco. He quickly 
signed with the Milwaukee Brewers. In 1998, Franco was back in Japan playing 
for Chiba Lotte. The following year, he returned to North America, in the 
Mexican League with a .423 average in 93 games (and also a strikeout in 
his only MLB at bat with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays). In 2000, Franco was 
back in Asia but, this time, in South Korea to play for the Samsung Lions. 
He returned again to the Mexican League in 2001. In September 2001, Franco 
was a 43-year-old who had just one major league at bat in the previous 
three seasons. Despite his lengthy absence, the Atlanta Braves, after seeing 
his success in the Mexican League, purchased his contract from the Angelopolis 
(Mexico City) Tigers. Franco played well defensively as a first baseman 
and was a good hitter against left-handed pitchers. The Braves re-signed 
him after that season and each of the next three. Franco was talking in 
the weight room in August 2003 with Jason Marquis, when he leaned on a 
stand and an 80-pound weight rolled over his finger, breaking it. "When 
the weight started to roll", Franco said, "I said, 'Uh-oh.'"[9] In 2004, 
Franco passed Cap Anson as the oldest regularly playing position player 
in MLB history. (A few regularly playing pitchers, including knuckleballers 
Phil Niekro and Hoyt Wilhelm, were older than Franco, and a few non-pitchers, 
like Minnie Miñoso and Jim O'Rourke, appeared as publicity stunts at old 
ages but did not play regularly.) On December 8, 2005, at age 47, Franco 
signed a two-year contract with the Mets. Franco had been the oldest player 
in the major leagues from 2004 to 2007, and was the last active player 
who was born in the 1950s. On April 20, 2006, pinch-hitting with one out 
in the eighth inning against the San Diego Padres, Franco hit a go-ahead 
two-run home run, becoming the oldest player in Major League history to 
hit a home run. Franco hit a three-run homer on September 30, 2006, in 
Washington to extend his own record. It was one of three hits in the game 
for Franco, who fell a triple short of hitting for the cycle. Franco yet 
again bested himself on May 4, 2007 when he homered into the swimming pool 
at Chase Field against Arizona Diamondbacks lefty Randy Johnson – a game 
in which he also stole a base. Franco was also the oldest player ever to 
hit a grand slam, a pinch-hit home run, two home runs in one game, and 
to steal two bases in a game. On April 26, 2006, Franco became the second-oldest 
man in MLB history to steal a base, behind only Arlie Latham, who accomplished 
the feat in a token appearance at age 49 with the New York Giants in 1909. 
On July 29, 2006, against the Atlanta Braves, Franco became the oldest 
player ever to pinch run, when he came in for Carlos Delgado after Delgado 
was hit by pitch. On September 19, 2006, a day after the Mets clinched 
the division title, Franco started at third base in a game against the 
Florida Marlins. This was Franco's first start at the position since his 
rookie year, marking 24 years between starts at the position.[10] Franco 
struggled with the Mets in 2007, achieving just a .200 batting average 
(in only 50 at-bats in half a season). Franco grew unhappy with insufficient 
playing time before being designated for assignment on July 12.[11] He 
subsequently re-signed with the Atlanta Braves on July 18 and was placed 
on the team's active roster. In his first game since re-signing with the 
Braves, he went 1-for-3 with 2 RBIs and received 2 standing ovations in 
a Braves 10–1 rout of the Cardinals. On August 1, just 13 days after the 
Braves signed him, the Braves designated Franco for assignment. He accepted 
a minor league assignment on August 8 and was called back up as promised 
on September 1. He declared free agency on October 29, 2007. Franco began 
the 2008 season – his 31st in professional baseball – as a first baseman 
for the Tigres de Quintana Roo (Cancún) in the Mexican League.[12] On May 
2, 2008, Franco officially announced his retirement from baseball to his 
Mexican League team, the Quintana Roo Tigers. An official announcement 
was released the next day. Franco said that retiring was the hardest decision 
he had ever made, but he pointed to his decreasing production as a player 
and said that he felt like it was time to retire.[13] Franco was hired 
in March 2009 as the manager of the rookie-level Gulf Coast League Mets.[14] 
In Franco's only season managing the team, they posted a record of 22 wins 
and 34 losses.[3] In 2010–2011, Franco managed a winter league team, the 
Caribes de Anzoátegui, in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. 
He led the team to its first league championship in 20 years. He returned 
to the team the following season, but he was fired after the team started 
with a 28-28 win-loss record.[15] Soon thereafter, Franco was hired as 
the manager of the Pericos de Puebla for the 2012 Mexican League season.[16] 
In two seasons with Puebla, he led the team to 110 wins and 104 losses.[3] 
Franco appeared on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot in 2013. Paul White 
of USA Today wrote that while Franco was a consistent player over a long 
career, he was rarely dominant. White wrote that Franco's statistics were 
inferior to other Baseball Hall of Fame second basemen.[17] Franco received 
six Hall of Fame votes (1.1% of the total ballots), an insufficient total 
to appear on the next year's ballot.[18] On May 16, 2014, the Fort Worth 
Cats of United League Baseball announced that Franco had been signed for 
the 2014 season.[19] He went 6 for 27 in 7 games.[20] On February 8, 2015, 
Ishikawa Million Stars of the professional Japanese Independent baseball 
league Baseball Challenge League announced that Franco had been signed 
as a player-manager for the 2015 season.[20][21] Franco said that he did 
not think he would appear often as a player, but 14 games into the season, 
Franco had played in ten games owing to an injury to a key player.[22]
