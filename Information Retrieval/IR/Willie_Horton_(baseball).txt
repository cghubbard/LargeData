Willie Wattison Horton (born October 18, 1942) is a former left fielder 
and designated hitter in Major League Baseball who played for six American 
League teams, primarily the Detroit Tigers. He hit 20 or more home runs 
seven times, and his 325 career home runs ranked sixth among AL right-handed 
hitters when he retired. He enjoyed his best season in 1968 with the world 
champion Tigers, finishing second in the AL with 36 homers, a .543 slugging 
average and 278 total bases. In the later years of his career, he was twice 
named the AL's top designated hitter. Horton is the youngest of twenty-one 
children of James Horton and his wife Lillian (Wattison) Horton. He was 
born in Arno, Virginia, a small community in the corporate limits of Appalachia.[1] 
Willie Horton hit a home run at Tiger Stadium when he was 16 years old 
during an all-city high school game. After winning a city championship 
with Detroit Northwestern High School in 1959, he signed with the Tigers 
in 1961, playing for the Tigers' farm team, the Duluth Dukes, on the shores 
of Lake Superior, and made his debut with the Tigers on September 10, 1963. 
He had a pinch-hit home run off Robin Roberts in his second at bat. He 
saw limited playing time in his first two years before a 1965 rookie campaign 
in which he was second in the AL with 104 runs batted in (RBIs) and third 
with 29 home runs. He was named to the All-Star team, and placed eighth 
in the MVP balloting. Becoming known for his tremendous strength, often 
hitting home runs with a one-handed swing, he again collected 100 RBIs 
in the 1966 season. During the 1967 Detroit 12th Street riot, he tried 
bravely to restore peace. He stood in his Tiger uniform on a car in the 
middle of the chaos, pleading for calm.[citation needed] However, despite 
his impassioned pleas, the city burned for five more days.[2] Horton posted 
double-digit home run totals in 12 regular seasons from 1965–76, and hit 
two home runs in a game on 30 occasions. He had a career-high 36 HRs in 
1968, a pitcher's year in which Detroit won the World Series; he finished 
second in the AL to Frank Howard in homers, slugging and total bases. In 
a year in which the league batting average was .230 and Carl Yastrzemski 
won the batting title with a .301 mark, Horton's .285 average was good 
for fourth in the AL, and he finished fourth in the MVP voting. He also 
batted .304 in the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. In order 
to combine Horton's offensive power with a good defense, manager Mayo Smith 
moved regular center fielder Mickey Stanley to shortstop as a replacement 
for Ray Oyler, who was benched because of his paltry .135 batting average. 
He kept Al Kaline, a multiple Gold Glove Award winner, in right field and 
put Jim Northrup in center field; the two had platooned in right field 
for much of the year. When the Tigers were safely[clarification needed] 
ahead, Oyler would replace Stanley at shortstop, batting in Horton's lineup 
spot; Stanley returned to center field, and Northrup would move over to 
replace Horton in left field. In Game 2, Horton had a solo home run to 
give the Tigers an early 1–0 lead, and they won 8–1. While not considered 
a great defensive outfielder, he made a pivotal play in the fifth inning 
of Game 5. With the Cardinals leading the Series 3–1 and the game 3–2, 
Lou Brock doubled with one out, and tried to score on Julián Javier's single; 
but he chose not to slide, and Horton's throw reached catcher Bill Freehan 
on the fly to beat Brock on a close play. Horton still lists the throw 
as the most memorable moment of his career.[2] Detroit scored three runs 
in the seventh inning to win 5–3, and went on to win Games 6 and 7 as well; 
Horton had two runs and two RBI in the 13–1 blowout in Game 6, and two 
hits and a run in the final 4–1 victory. Horton was a four-time member 
of the AL All-Star team (1965, 1968, 1970 and 1973). He hit three home 
runs against the Milwaukee Brewers on June 9, 1970. On April 14, 1974, 
he hit a popup which struck and killed a pigeon at Fenway Park. He was 
named the AL's Outstanding Designated Hitter in 1975 after hitting 25 home 
runs with 92 RBIs. On July 18, 1969, playing against the Cleveland Indians, 
he tied Boston Braves outfielder Earl Clark's record for most put outs 
in a nine inning game by a left fielder, nine, a record that has since 
been tied by Jacoby Ellsbury of the Boston Red Sox. Early in the 1977 season 
he was traded to the Texas Rangers, and he again hit three home runs on 
May 15 against the Kansas City Royals at Royals Stadium. He spent 1978 
playing for the Cleveland Indians, Oakland Athletics and Toronto Blue Jays, 
before finally settling with the Seattle Mariners from 1979–80. In 1979 
with the Mariners he was again named the AL's Outstanding Designated Hitter 
after hitting .279 with 29 HRs and a career-high 106 RBIs, and he received 
The Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award as well. On June 5, 
against the Tigers he hit what seemed to be his 300th career home run, 
but it struck a speaker hanging from the roof of the Kingdome and bounced 
onto the field for a single; he would collect number 300 the next day against 
Jack Morris. His Mariners record of 106 RBIs was broken by Alvin Davis 
in 1984, his marks of 180 hits and 296 total bases were broken by Phil 
Bradley in 1985, and his record of 29 home runs was broken by Gorman Thomas 
in 1985. His record of 646 at bats was broken by Alex Rodriguez in 1998; 
Horton remains one of only four Mariners to have played the full 162 games 
in a season. He played his final major league game on October 5, 1980. 
In an 18-season career, Horton posted a .273 batting average and .457 slugging 
average with 1993 hits, 284 doubles, 1,163 RBIs, 873 runs and 20 stolen 
bases in 2028 games. His 325 home runs in the AL placed him behind only 
Harmon Killebrew (573), Jimmie Foxx (524), teammate Al Kaline (399), Rocky 
Colavito (371) and Joe DiMaggio (361) among right-handed hitters. Horton 
played two more years in the Pacific Coast League and another season in 
Mexican baseball. In 1978, he became the manager of Venezuelan team Navegantes 
del Magallanes, whom he had guided to the Championship of 1979 Caribbean 
Series with a 5–1 record. Among his baseball superstitions was his use 
of the same batting helmet throughout his career; he repainted it when 
he changed teams.[citation needed] After retiring, he coached for the New 
York Yankees and Chicago White Sox. On July 15, 2000 Horton became just 
the sixth former player given the ultimate honor by the Detroit Tigers; 
a statue of Horton was placed in Comerica Park and his number 23 was retired, 
joining a select group that includes former Tigers players Ty Cobb (who 
did not wear a number), Charlie Gehringer (number 2), Hank Greenberg (number 
5), Al Kaline (number 6), and Hal Newhouser (number 16). While Horton's 
career body of work was solid and workmanlike, it was not quite of the 
same caliber as that of his Tiger brethren enshrined in Cooperstown;[citation 
needed] nevertheless, the statue is a testament to the crucial role he 
played in restoring peace and quelling eruptions during the 1967 riot, 
and to this day endures as an important symbol of peace and harmony in 
a hardscrabble city often beset by racial tension.[citation needed] Since 
2003, Horton has served as a Special Assistant to Tigers President/CEO/General 
Manager, originally Dave Dombrowski, and now Al Avila. Former Tigers teammate 
Al Kaline also holds this position, and the two threw out the first pitch 
of the 2006 World Series at Comerica Park. For the ninth consecutive year, 
the state of Michigan recognized one man's ability to overcome obstacles 
and achieve a lifetime of success when "Willie Horton Day" was celebrated 
on Thursday, October 18, 2012. Horton is the fourth person in Michigan 
history to be given a day, with the third being Rosa Parks. On Opening 
Day 2013, Horton threw out the first pitch at Comerica Park in Detroit.
