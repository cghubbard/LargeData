Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈɛtsõ (w)ɐˈɾɐ̃tʃiz 
du nɐsiˈmẽtu]; born 23 October 1940),[1] known as Pelé (Brazilian Portuguese: [pe̞ˈlɛ]), 
is a retired Brazilian professional footballer who played as a forward. 
He is widely regarded as the greatest player of all time. Pelé has also 
been known for connecting the phrase "The Beautiful Game" with football. 
In 1999, he was voted World Player of the Century by the International 
Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS). That year, France 
Football asked their former Ballon d'Or winners to choose the Football 
Player of the Century; they selected Pelé. In 1999, Pelé was elected Athlete 
of the Century by the IOC. That year, Time named him in their list of 100 
most influential people of the 20th century. In 2013 he received the FIFA 
Ballon d'Or Prix d'Honneur in recognition of his career and achievements 
as a global icon of football. According to the IFFHS, Pelé is the most 
successful league goal-scorer in the world, with 541 league goals. During 
his career, Pelé scored 1281 goals in 1363 games, which included unofficial 
friendlies and tour games. He was listed in the Guinness World Records 
for most career goals scored in football for this. During his playing days, 
Pelé was for a period the best-paid athlete in the world.[8] In Brazil, 
he is hailed as a national hero for his accomplishments in football and 
for his outspoken support of policies that improve the social conditions 
of the poor. In 1961, Brazil President Jânio Quadros had Pelé declared 
a national treasure. During his career, he became known as "The Black Pearl" 
(A Pérola Negra), "The King of Football" (O Rei do Futebol), "The King 
Pelé" (O Rei Pelé) or simply "The King" (O Rei).[9] Pelé began playing 
for Santos at age 15 and the Brazil national football team at 16. During 
his international career, he won three FIFA World Cups: 1958, 1962 and 
1970, being the only player ever to do so. Pelé is the all-time leading 
goalscorer for Brazil with 77 goals in 91 games. At club level he is also 
the record goalscorer for Santos, and led them to the 1962 and 1963 Copa 
Libertadores. Pelé's "electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals" 
made him a star around the world, and his club team Santos toured internationally 
in order to take full advantage of his popularity.[10] Since retiring in 
1977, Pelé has been a worldwide ambassador for football and has made many 
acting and commercial ventures. In 2010, he was named the Honorary President 
of the New York Cosmos. "In my mid-teens I also played indoor football, 
which had just taken off in Bauru, for a team called Radium, and took part 
in the first futebol de salão championship to be held in Bauru. We won. 
Futebol de salão was a new thing and I took to it like a fish to water. 
It's a lot quicker than football on grass. You have to think really quickly 
because everyone is close to each other. Learning the game probably helped 
me think on my feet better. It was through futebol de salão that I first 
got my chance to play with adults. I was about fourteen, and I can remember 
that there was a tournament for which I was told I was too young to take 
part. In the end, I was allowed to play. I ended up top scorer, with fourteen 
or fifteen goals. That gave me a lot of confidence. I knew then not to 
be afraid of whatever might come." Pelé was born in Três Corações, Minas 
Gerais, Brazil, the son of Fluminense footballer Dondinho (born João Ramos 
do Nascimento) and Celeste Arantes. He was the elder of two siblings.[12] 
He was named after the American inventor Thomas Edison.[1][13] His parents 
decided to remove the "i" and call him "Edson", but there was a mistake 
on the birth certificate, leading many documents to show his name as "Edison", 
not "Edson", as he is called.[1][14] He was originally nicknamed Dico by 
his family.[12][15] He received the nickname "Pelé" during his school days, 
when it is claimed he was given it because of his pronunciation of the 
name of his favorite player, local Vasco da Gama goalkeeper Bilé, which 
he misspoke but the more he complained the more it stuck. In his autobiography, 
Pelé stated he had no idea what the name means, nor did his old friends.[12] 
Apart from the assertion that the name is derived from that of Bilé, and 
that it is Hebrew for "miracle" (פֶּ֫לֶא), the word has no known meaning 
in Portuguese.[16] Pelé grew up in poverty in Bauru in the state of São 
Paulo. He earned extra money by working in tea shops as a servant. Taught 
to play by his father, he could not afford a proper football and usually 
played with either a sock stuffed with newspaper and tied with a string 
or a grapefruit.[9][12] He played for several amateur teams in his youth, 
including Sete de Setembro, Canto do Rio, São Paulinho, and Amériquinha.[17][18] 
Pelé led Bauru Athletic Club juniors (coached by Waldemar de Brito) to 
three consecutive São Paulo state youth championships between 1954 and 
1956.[19] He also dominated Futebol de Salão (indoor football) competitions 
in the region and won several championships with local team Radium.[19] 
In 1956, de Brito took Pelé to Santos, an industrial and port city located 
near São Paulo, to try out for professional club Santos FC, telling the 
directors at Santos that the 15-year-old would be "the greatest football 
player in the world."[17][19] Pelé impressed Santos coach Lula during his 
trial at the Estádio Vila Belmiro, and he signed a professional contract 
with the club in June 1956.[17][19] Pelé was highly promoted in the local 
media as a future superstar. He made his senior team debut on 7 September 
1956 at the age of 15 against Corinthians Santo Andre and had an impressive 
performance in a 7–1 victory, scoring the first of his record 1281 goals 
in football during the match.[20][21] When the 1957 season started, Pelé 
was given a starting place in the first team and, at the age of 16, became 
the top scorer in the league. Ten months after signing professionally, 
the teenager was called up to the Brazil national team. After the 1962 
World Cup, wealthy European clubs such as Real Madrid, Juventus and Manchester 
United tried to sign him, but the government of Brazil declared Pelé an 
"official national treasure" to prevent him from being transferred out 
of the country.[9] Pelé won his first major title with Santos in 1958 as 
the team won the Campeonato Paulista; Pelé would finish the tournament 
as top scorer with 58 goals,[22] a record that stands today. A year later, 
he would help the team earn their first victory in the Torneio Rio-São 
Paulo with a 3–0 over Vasco da Gama.[23] However, Santos was unable to 
retain the Paulista title. In 1960, Pelé scored 33 goals to help his team 
regain the Campeonato Paulista trophy but lost out on the Rio-São Paulo 
tournament after finishing in 8th place.[24] Another 47 goals from Pelé 
saw Santos retain the Campeonato Paulista. The club went on to win the 
Taça Brasil that same year, beating Bahia in the finals; Pelé finished 
as top scorer of the tournament with nine goals. The victory allowed Santos 
to participate in the Copa Libertadores, the most prestigious club tournament 
in the Western hemisphere.[25] "I arrived hoping to stop a great man, but 
I went away convinced I had been undone by someone who was not born on 
the same planet as the rest of us." Santos's most successful club season 
started in 1962;[13] the team was seeded in Group One alongside Cerro Porteño 
and Deportivo Municipal Bolivia, winning every match of their group but 
one (a 1–1 away tie vs Cerro), with Pelé scoring his first goal against 
Cerro. Santos defeated Universidad Católica in the semifinals and met defending 
champions Peñarol in the finals in which Pelé scored twice in the playoff 
match to secure the first title for a Brazilian club.[27] Pelé finished 
as the second top scorer of the competition with four goals. That same 
year, Santos would successfully defend the Campeonato Brasileiro (with 
37 goals from Pelé) and the Taça Brasil (Pelé scoring four goals in the 
final series against Botafogo). Santos would also win the 1962 Intercontinental 
Cup against Benfica.[28] Wearing his number 10 shirt, Pelé produced one 
of the best performances of his career, scoring a hat-trick in Lisbon as 
Santos won 5–2.[29][30] As the defending champions, Santos qualified automatically 
to the semi-final stage of the 1963 Copa Libertadores. The ballet blanco 
managed to retain the title after victories over Botafogo and Boca Juniors. 
Pelé helped Santos overcome a Botafogo team that contained Brazilian legends 
such as Garrincha and Jairzinho with a last-minute goal in the first leg 
of the semi-finals which made it 1–1. In the second leg, Pelé scored a 
hat-trick in the Estádio do Maracanã as Santos won, 0–4, in the second 
leg. Santos started the final series by winning, 3–2, in the first leg 
and defeating Boca Juniors 1–2, in La Bombonera, with another goal from 
Pelé.[31] Santos became the first (and to date the only) Brazilian team 
to lift the Copa Libertadores in Argentine soil. Pelé finished the tournament 
with 5 goals. Santos lost the Campeonato Paulista after finishing in third 
place but went on to win the Rio-São Paulo tournament after a 0–3 win over 
Flamengo in the final, with Pelé scoring one. Pelé would also help Santos 
retain the Intercontinental Cup and the Taça Brasil.[28] In the 1964 Copa 
Libertadores, Santos were beaten in both legs of the semi-finals by Independiente. 
The club won the Campeonato Paulista, with Pelé netting 34 goals. Santos 
also shared the Rio-São Paulo title with Botafogo and won the Taça Brasil 
for the fourth consecutive year. In the 1965 Copa Libertadores, Santos 
reached the semi-finals and met Peñarol in a rematch of the 1962 final. 
After two matches, a playoff was needed to break the tie.[13] Unlike 1962, 
Peñarol came out on top and eliminated Santos 2–1.[13] Pelé would, however, 
finish as the topscorer of the tournament with eight goals.[32] This proved 
to be the start of a decline as Santos failed to retain the Torneio Rio-São 
Paulo. In 1966, Pelé and Santos also failed to retain the Taça Brasil as 
O Rei's goals weren't enough to prevent a 9–4 defeat by Cruzeiro (led by 
Tostão) in the final series. The club did however win the Campeonato Paulista 
in 1967, 1968 and 1969. On 19 November 1969, Pelé scored his 1000th goal 
in all competitions, in what was a highly anticipated moment in Brazil.[13] 
The goal, popularly dubbed O Milésimo (The Thousandth), occurred in a match 
against Vasco da Gama, when Pelé scored from a penalty kick, at the Maracanã 
Stadium.[13] Pelé states that his most memorable goal was scored at Rua 
Javari stadium on a Campeonato Paulista match against São Paulo rival Juventus 
on 2 August 1959. As there is no video footage of this match, Pelé asked 
that a computer animation be made of this specific goal.[13] In March 1961, 
Pelé scored the gol de placa (goal worthy of a plaque), against Fluminense 
at the Maracanã.[33] Pelé received the ball on the edge of his own penalty 
area, and ran the length of the field, eluding opposition players with 
feints, before striking the ball beyond the goalkeeper.[33] A plaque was 
commissioned with a dedication to "the most beautiful goal in the history 
of the Maracanã".[34] Pelé's "electrifying play and penchant for spectacular 
goals" made him a star around the world.[35] His team Santos toured internationally 
in order to take full advantage of his popularity. In 1967, the two factions 
involved in the Nigerian Civil War agreed to a 48-hour ceasefire so they 
could watch Pelé play an exhibition game in Lagos.[35] During his time 
at Santos, Pelé played alongside many gifted players, including Zito, Pepe, 
and Coutinho; the latter partnered him in numerous one-two plays, attacks, 
and goals.[36] After the 1974 season (his 19th with Santos), Pelé retired 
from Brazilian club football although he continued to occasionally play 
for Santos in official competitive matches. Two years later, he came out 
of semi-retirement to sign with the New York Cosmos of the North American 
Soccer League (NASL) for the 1975 season. Though well past his prime at 
this point, Pelé is credited with significantly increasing public awareness 
and interest of the sport in the United States. Hoping to fuel the same 
kind of awareness in the Dominican Republic, he and the Cosmos team played 
in an exhibition match against Haitian team, Violette AC, in the Santo 
Domingo Olympic Stadium on 3 June 1976, where over 25,000 fans watched 
him score a winning goal in the last seconds of the match, leading the 
Cosmos to a 2–1 victory.[37] He led the Cosmos to the 1977 NASL championship, 
in his third and final season with the club.[38] On 1 October 1977, Pelé 
closed out his career in an exhibition match between the Cosmos and Santos. 
Santos arrived in New York and New Jersey after previously defeating the 
Seattle Sounders, 2–0. The match was played in front of a sold out crowd 
at Giants Stadium and was televised in the United States on ABC's Wide 
World of Sports as well as throughout the world.[39] Pelé's father and 
wife both attended the match, as well as Muhammad Ali and Bobby Moore.[39] 
Pelé played the first half for the Cosmos and the second half for Santos. 
Pelé scored his final goal from a direct free kick, and Cosmos won 2–1.[39] 
Pelé's first international match was a 2–1 defeat against Argentina on 
7 July 1957 at the Maracanã.[40][41] In that match, he scored his first 
goal for Brazil aged 16 years and nine months to become the youngest player 
to score in international football.[42] Pelé arrived in Sweden sidelined 
by a knee injury but on his return from the treatment room, his colleagues 
closed ranks and insisted upon his selection.[43][44] His first match was 
against the USSR in the third match of the first round of the 1958 FIFA 
World Cup, where he gave the assist to Vavá's second goal.[45] He was the 
youngest player of that tournament, and at the time the youngest ever to 
play in the World Cup.[46] He scored his first World Cup goal against Wales 
in quarter-finals, the only goal of the match, to help Brazil advance to 
semifinals, while becoming the youngest ever World Cup goalscorer at 17 years 
and 239 days.[41] Against France in the semifinal, Brazil were leading 
2–1 at halftime, and then Pelé scored a hat-trick, becoming the youngest 
in World Cup history to do so.[47] On 29 June 1958 Pelé became the youngest 
player to play in a World Cup final match at 17 years and 249 days. He 
scored two goals in that final as Brazil beat Sweden 5–2 in the capital 
of Stockholm. His first goal where he flicked the ball over a defender 
before volleying into the corner of the net, was selected as one of the 
best goals in the history of the World Cup.[48] Following Pelé's second 
goal, Swedish player Sigvard Parling would later comment; "When Pelé scored 
the fifth goal in that Final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding".[49] 
When the match ended, Pelé passed out on the field, and had to be attended 
by the medical staff.[13] He then recovered, and was compelled by the victory 
to weep as he was being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the 
tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, 
behind record-breaker Just Fontaine, and was named best young player of 
the tournament.[50] It was in the 1958 World Cup that Pelé began wearing 
a jersey with number 10. Recently it has become known that the event was 
the result of disorganization: the leaders did not send the shirt numbers 
of players and it was up to FIFA to choose the number 10 shirt to Pele 
who was a substitute on the occasion.[51] The press proclaimed Pelé the 
greatest revelation of the 1958 World Cup, and he was also retroactively 
given the Silver Ball as the second best player of the tournament, behind 
Didi.[52][53] Pelé also played in the South American Championship. In the 
1959 competition he was named best player of the tournament and was top 
scorer with 8 goals, as Brazil came second despite being unbeaten in the 
tournament.[49][54][55] This was expected to be Pelé's World Cup, as he 
was rated as the best player in the world at the time.[56] In the first 
match of the 1962 World Cup in Chile, against Mexico, Pelé assisted the 
first goal and then scored the second one, after a run past four defenders, 
to go up 2–0.[57] He injured himself while attempting a long-range shot 
against Czechoslovakia.[13] This would keep him out of the rest of the 
tournament, and forced coach Aymoré Moreira to make his only lineup change 
of the tournament. The substitute was Amarildo, who performed well for 
the rest of the tournament. However, it was Garrincha who would take the 
leading role and carry Brazil to their second World Cup title, after beating 
Czechoslovakia at the final in the capital of Santiago.[58] The 1966 World 
Cup in England was marked, among other things, for the brutal fouling on 
Pelé, by the Bulgarian and Portuguese defenders.[59] Pelé was the most 
famous footballer in the world, and Brazil fielded some world champions 
like Garrincha, Gilmar and Djalma Santos with the addition of other stars 
like Jairzinho, Tostão and Gérson, leading to high expectations for them.[60] 
Brazil was eliminated in the first round, playing only three matches.[60] 
Pelé scored the first goal from a free kick against Bulgaria, becoming 
the first player to score in three successive FIFA World Cups, but due 
to his injury, a result of persistent fouling by the Bulgarians, he missed 
the second game against Hungary.[60] Brazil lost that game and Pelé, although 
still recovering, was brought back for the last crucial match against Portugal 
at Goodison Park in Liverpool by the Brazilian coach Vicente Feola. Feola 
changed the entire defense, including the goalkeeper, while in midfield 
he returned to the formation of the first match. In attack he maintained 
Jairzinho and substituted the other two players, despite knowing that Pelé 
was still recovering from his serious injuries.[61] During the game, Portugal 
defender João Morais brutally fouled Pelé, but was not sent off by referee 
George McCabe, of whom it is acknowledged let "the Portuguese get away 
with murder".[62] Pelé had to stay on the field limping for the rest of 
the game, since substitutes were not allowed at that time.[62] After this 
game he vowed he would never again play in the World Cup, a decision he 
would later change.[56] "The most wondrous player of all [Pelé] consecrated 
Brazil as the cathedral of The Beautiful Game. Brazil '70 were a team of 
superstars dedicated not just to a cause but an ideal, a dream of what 
football should be." Pelé was called to the national team in early 1969, 
he refused at first, but then accepted and played in six World Cup qualifying 
matches, scoring six goals.[64] The 1970 World Cup in Mexico was to be 
Pelé's last. Brazil's squad for the tournament featured major changes in 
relation to the 1966 squad. Players like Garrincha, Nilton Santos, Valdir 
Pereira, Djalma Santos and Gilmar had already retired, but the team, with 
Pelé, Rivelino, Jairzinho, Gérson, Carlos Alberto Torres, Tostão and Clodoaldo, 
is often considered to be the greatest football team in history.[65][66][67] 
The front five of Jairzinho, Pelé, Gerson, Tostão and Rivelino together 
created an attacking momentum, with Pelé having a central role in Brazil's 
way to the final.[68] All of Brazil's matches in the tournament (except 
the final) were played in Guadalajara, and in the first match against Czechoslovakia, 
Pelé gave Brazil a 2–1 lead, by controlling Gerson's long pass with his 
chest and then scoring. In this match Pelé attempted to lob goalkeeper 
Ivo Viktor from the half-way line, only narrowly missing the Czechoslovak 
goal.[69] Brazil went on to win the match, 4–1. In the first half of the 
match against England, Pelé nearly scored with a header that was saved 
by the England goalkeeper Gordon Banks.[70][71] In the second half, he 
controlled a cross from Tostão before flicking the ball to Jairzinho who 
scored the only goal.[72] Against Romania in Guadalajara, Pelé scored the 
first goal with a bending free kick hit with the outside of his right foot.[72] 
Later in the match he scored again to make it 3–1.[72] Brazil won by a 
final score of 3–2. In the quarterfinals against Peru, Brazil won 4–2, 
with Pelé assisting Tostão for Brazil's third goal. In their semi-final 
match, Brazil faced Uruguay for the first time since the 1950 World Cup 
final round match. Jairzinho put Brazil ahead 2–1, and Pelé assisted Rivelino 
for the 3–1. During that match, Pelé made one of his most famous plays.[69] 
Tostão passed the ball for Pelé to collect which Uruguay's goalkeeper Ladislao 
Mazurkiewicz took notice of and ran off his line to get the ball before 
Pelé. However, Pelé got there first and fooled Mazurkiewicz with a feint 
by not touching the ball, causing it to roll to the goalkeepers left, while 
Pelé went to the goalkeepers right. Pelé ran around the goalkeeper to retrieve 
the ball and took a shot while turning towards the goal, but he turned 
in excess as he shot, and the ball drifted just wide of the far post.[73] 
Brazil played Italy in the final at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City.[74] 
Pelé scored the opening goal with a header over Italian defender Tarcisio 
Burgnich. He then made assists on Brazil's third goal, scored by Jairzinho, 
and the fourth finished by Carlos Alberto which is often considered the 
greatest team goal of all time, involving all but two of the team's outfield 
players, and ended with Pelé making a blind pass which went into the path 
of Carlos Alberto, who came running from behind, and struck the ball to 
score.[75][76] Brazil won the match 4–1, keeping the Jules Rimet Trophy 
indefinitely, and Pelé received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament.[49][77] 
Burgnich, who marked Pelé during the final, was quoted saying "I told myself 
before the game, he's made of skin and bones just like everyone else — 
but I was wrong".[78] Pelé's last international match was on 18 July 1971 
against Yugoslavia in Rio de Janeiro. With Pelé on the field, the Brazilian 
team's record was 67 wins, 14 draws and 11 losses.[64][79] Brazil never 
lost a match while fielding both Pelé and Garrincha.[80] "Pelé is the greatest 
player of all time. He reigned supreme for 20 years. All the others – Diego 
Maradona, Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini – rank beneath him. There's no one 
to compare with Pelé." "Pelé was one of the few who contradicted my theory: 
instead of 15 minutes of fame, he will have 15 centuries." "My name is 
Ronald Reagan, I'm the President of the United States of America. But you 
don't need to introduce yourself, because everyone knows who Pelé is." 
Pelé is one of the most lauded players in history and is frequently ranked 
the best player ever.[81][82][83] Among his contemporaries, Dutch star 
Johan Cruyff stated; "Pelé was the only footballer who surpassed the boundaries 
of logic."[26] Brazil's 1970 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Carlos Alberto 
Torres opined; "His great secret was improvisation. Those things he did 
were in one moment. He had an extraordinary perception of the game."[26] 
Tostão, his strike partner at the 1970 World Cup; "Pelé was the greatest 
– he was simply flawless. And off the pitch he is always smiling and upbeat. 
You never see him bad-tempered. He loves being Pelé."[26] His Brazilian 
teammate Clodoaldo commented on the adulation he witnessed; "In some countries 
they wanted to touch him, in some they wanted to kiss him. In others they 
even kissed the ground he walked on. I thought it was beautiful, just beautiful."[26] 
Former Real Madrid and Hungary star Ferenc Puskás stated; "The greatest 
player in history was Di Stefano. I refuse to classify Pelé as a player. 
He was above that."[26] Just Fontaine, French striker and leading scorer 
at the 1958 World Cup; "When I saw Pelé play, it made me feel I should 
hang up my boots."[26] England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Bobby 
Moore commented: "Pelé was the most complete player I've ever seen, he 
had everything. Two good feet. Magic in the air. Quick. Powerful. Could 
beat people with skill. Could outrun people. Only five feet and eight inches 
tall, yet he seemed a giant of an athlete on the pitch. Perfect balance 
and impossible vision. He was the greatest because he could do anything 
and everything on a football pitch. I remember Saldhana the coach being 
asked by a Brazilian journalist who was the best goalkeeper in his squad. 
He said Pelé. The man could play in any position".[84] Former Manchester 
United striker and member of England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning team 
Sir Bobby Charlton stated; "I sometimes feel as though football was invented 
for this magical player."[26] During the 1970 World Cup, a British television 
commentator asked; "How do you spell Pelé?", with the response; "Easy: 
G-O-D."[26] Since retiring, Pelé has continued to be lauded by players, 
coaches, journalists and others. Brazilian attacking midfielder Zico, who 
represented Brazil at the 1978, 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cup, stated; "This 
debate about the player of the century is absurd. There's only one possible 
answer: Pelé. He's the greatest player of all time, and by some distance 
I might add".[85] French three time Balon D'or winner Michel Platini said; 
"There's Pelé the man, and then Pelé the player. And to play like Pelé 
is to play like God." Joint FIFA Player of the Century, Argentina's 1986 
FIFA World Cup-winning captain Diego Maradona stated; "It's too bad we 
never got along, but he was an awesome player".[85] Prolific Brazilian 
striker Romário, winner of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and player of the tournament; 
"It's only inevitable I look up to Pelé. He's like a God to us".[85] Two-time 
FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo said: "Pelé is the greatest player 
in football history, and there will only be one Pelé", while José Mourinho, 
two-time UEFA Champions League winning manager, commented; "I think he 
is football. You have the real special one – Mr Pelé."[86] Real Madrid 
honorary president and former player, Alfredo Di Stéfano, opined; "The 
best player ever? Pelé. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are both great 
players with specific qualities, but Pelé was better".[87] Presenting Pelé 
a lifetime achievement award, former South African president Nelson Mandela 
said; "To watch him play was to watch the delight of a child combined with 
the extraordinary grace of a man in full."[88] US statesman and political 
scientist Henry Kissinger stated, "Performance at a high level in any sport 
is to exceed the ordinary human scale. But Pelé's performance transcended 
that of the ordinary star by as much as the star exceeds ordinary performance."[89] 
Former Brazilian ambassador to the United Nations, J.B. Pinheiro, commented; 
"Pelé played football for 22 years, and in that time he did more to promote 
world friendship and fraternity than any other ambassador anywhere."[26] 
One of the world's most famous people since the mid 20th century, a reporter 
asked if his fame compared to that of Jesus, Pelé in response quipped, 
"There are parts of the world where Jesus Christ is not so well known."[90] 
On 21 February 1966, Pelé married Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi;[91] they have 
two daughters, Kelly Cristina (born 13 January 1967), who married Dr. Arthur 
DeLuca, and Jennifer (b. 1978), as well as a son, Edson ("Edinho", b. 27 
August 1970). The couple divorced in 1982.[92] In 1977, Brazilian media 
reported that Pelé had his right kidney removed.[93] From 1981 to 1986, 
Pelé was romantically linked with the model Xuxa, and was seen as influential 
in launching her career; she was 17 when they started to date.[94] In April 
1994 Pelé married psychologist and gospel singer Assíria Lemos Seixas, 
who gave birth on 28 September 1996 to twins Joshua and Celeste through 
fertility treatments. The couple divorced in 2008. Pelé had at least two 
more children from former affairs. Sandra Machado, his daughter with a 
housemaid Anizia Machado in 1964, for years fought to be acknowledged by 
Pelé, who refused to submit to DNA tests.[95][96][97] Although she was 
recognized by courts as his daughter based on DNA evidence in 1993, Pelé 
never acknowledged his eldest daughter even after her death in 2006, nor 
her two children, Octavio and Gabriel.[96][97] Pelé had had another daughter, 
Flávia Kurtz, in an extramarital affair in 1968 with journalist Lenita 
Kurtz. Flávia was recognized by him as his daughter.[95] At the age of 
73, Pelé announced his intention to marry 41-year-old Marcia Aoki, a Japanese-Brazilian 
importer of medical equipment from Penápolis, São Paulo, whom he has been 
dating since 2010. They first met in the mid-1980s in New York, before 
meeting again in 2008.[98][99] Pelé is now married to Marcia Aoki who stood 
by him during his illness in 2014.[100] In 1970, Pelé was investigated 
by the Brazilian military dictatorship for suspected leftist sympathies. 
Declassified documents show Pelé was investigated after being handed a 
manifesto calling for the release of political prisoners. Pelé himself 
did not get further involved within political struggles in the country.[101] 
He has been criticized in the public opinion for his conservative views.[102] 
In June 2013, during the Brazilian protests, he asked for people to "forget 
the demonstrations" and support the Brazil national team.[103][104][105][106] 
In November 2012, Pelé underwent a successful hip operation.[107] In May 
2014, his son Edinho was jailed for 33 years for laundering money from 
drug trafficking.[108] Pelé has stated that he is a Catholic.[109] In 1995, 
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso appointed Pelé to the position 
of Extraordinary Minister for Sport, and he was also appointed a UNESCO 
Goodwill Ambassador.[110] During this time he proposed legislation to reduce 
corruption in Brazilian football, which became known as the "Pelé law." 
Pelé left his position in 2001 after he was accused of involvement in a 
corruption scandal, although nothing was proven, and it was denied by UNICEF.[111][112] 
In 1997, he received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II at 
a ceremony in Buckingham Palace.[113] Pelé also helped inaugurate the 2006 
FIFA World Cup finals, alongside supermodel Claudia Schiffer.[67] Pelé 
publicly accused the Brazilian football administrator Ricardo Teixeira 
of corruption after Pelé's television company was rejected in a contest 
for the Brazilian domestic rights to the 1994 World Cup.[114] Pelé accusations 
led to an eight-year feud between the pair.[115] As a consequence of the 
affair, the President of FIFA, João Havelange banned Pelé from the draw 
for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in Las Vegas. Criticisms over the ban were 
perceived to have negatively affected Havelange's chances of re-election 
as FIFA's president in 1994.[114] Pelé has published several autobiographies, 
starred in documentary films, and composed musical pieces, including the 
soundtrack for the film Pelé in 1977.[116] He appeared, alongside other 
footballers of the 1960s and 1970s, with Michael Caine, and Sylvester Stallone, 
in the 1981 film Escape to Victory, about a World War II-era football match 
between Allied prisoners of war and a German team.[117] in 1969, Pelé starred 
in a telenovela called Os Estranhos, about first contact with aliens. It 
was created to drum up interest in the Apollo missions.[118] In 2001, had 
a cameo role in the satire film, Mike Bassett: England Manager.[119] In 
2009, he cooperated with Ubisoft on arcade football game Academy of Champions: 
Soccer for the Wii and appeared in the game as a coach to its players.[120] 
On FIFA 14, Pelé plays for the Ultimate team known as Legends for the Xbox 
One, where game-players can acquire classic players from different eras.[121] 
In November 2007, Pelé was in Sheffield, England to mark the 150th anniversary 
of the world's oldest football club, Sheffield F.C..[122] Pelé was the 
guest of honour at Sheffield's anniversary match against Inter Milan, which 
Inter won 5–2 at Bramall Lane.[122] As part of his visit, Pelé opened an 
exhibition which included the first public showing in 40 years of the original 
hand-written rules of football.[122] Pelé scouted for Premier League club 
Fulham in 2002.[123] He made the draw for the qualification groups for 
the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals.[124] On 1 August 2010, Pelé was introduced 
as the Honorary President of a revived New York Cosmos, aiming to field 
a team in Major League Soccer[125] On 3 August 2011, it was reported that 
Santos were considering bringing him out of retirement for a cameo role 
in the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup, although this later turned out to be false.[126] 
The most notable area of Pelé's life since football is his ambassadorial 
work. In 1992, he was appointed a UN ambassador for ecology and the environment.[110][127] 
He was also awarded Brazil's Gold Medal for outstanding services to the 
sport in 1995. In 2012, Pelé was awarded an honorary degree from the University 
of Edinburgh for "significant contribution to humanitarian and environmental 
causes, as well as his sporting achievements".[128] On 12 August 2012, 
Pelé was an attendee at the 2012 Olympic hunger summit hosted by UK Prime 
Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street, London, part of a series of 
international efforts which have sought to respond to the return of hunger 
as a high-profile global issue.[129][130] Later on the same day, Pelé appeared 
at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, following 
the handover section to the next host city for the 2016 Summer Olympics, 
Rio de Janeiro.[131] In March 2016 Pelé filed a lawsuit against Samsung 
Electronics in the United States District Court for the Northern District 
of Illinois seeking $30 million in damages claiming violations under the 
Lanham Act for false endorsement and a state law claim for violation of 
his right of publicity.[132] The suit alleges, that at one point Samsung 
and Pelé came close to entering into a licensing agreement for Pelé to 
appear in a Samsung advertising campaign. Samsung abruptly pulled out of 
the negotiations. The October 2015 Samsung ad in question, includes a partial 
face shot of a man who allegedly "very closely resembles" Pelé and also 
a superimposed high-definition television screen next to the image of the 
man featuring a "modified bicycle or scissors-kick", perfected and famously 
used by Pelé.[133] Brazil Santos New York Cosmos In December 2000, Pelé 
and Maradona shared the prize of FIFA Player of the Century by FIFA.[162] 
The award was originally intended to be based upon votes in a web poll, 
but after it became apparent that it favoured Diego Maradona, many observers 
complained that the Internet nature of the poll would have meant a skewed 
demographic of younger fans who would have seen Maradona play, but not 
Pelé. FIFA then appointed a "Family of Football" committee of FIFA members 
to decide the winner of the award together with the votes of the readers 
of the FIFA Magazine. The committee chose Pelé. Since Maradona was winning 
the Internet poll, however, it was decided he and Pelé should share the 
award.[163] Pelé's goalscoring record is often reported by FIFA among others 
as being 1281 goals in 1363 games.[172] Some sources, however, claim that 
Pelé scored 1282 goals in 1366 games.[173] This figure includes goals scored 
by Pelé in friendly club matches, for example, international tours Pelé 
completed with Santos and the New York Cosmos, and a few games Pelé played 
in for armed forces teams during his national service in Brazil.[173] The 
tables below record every goal Pelé scored in major club competitions for 
Santos and the New York Cosmos. During much of Pelé's playing career in 
Brazil there was no national league championship. From 1960 onwards the 
Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) were required to provide meritocratic 
entrants for the then-new Copa Libertadores, a South American international 
club competition broadly equivalent to the European Cup. To enable them 
to do this, the CBF organised two national competitions: the Taça de Prata 
and Taça Brasil. A national league championship, the Campeonato Brasileiro, 
was first played in 1971, alongside traditional state and interstate competitions 
such as the Campeonato Paulista and the Torneio Rio-São Paulo. The number 
of league goals scored by Pelé for Santos and New York Cosmos is listed 
as 656 in 702 games, which is a world record for League competitions. This 
number is the sum of the goals scored by Pelé in domestic league-based 
competitions: the Campeonato Paulista (SPS), Torneio Rio-São Paulo (RSPS), 
Taça de Prata and Campeonato Brasileiro. The Taça Brasil was a national 
competition organised on a knockout basis. Pelé is the top scorer of the 
Brazil national football team with 77 goals in 91 official appearances.[7][188] 
In addition, he has scored 18 times in 22 unofficial games. This makes 
an unofficial total of 113 games and 95 goals. He has also scored 12 goals 
and is credited with 10 assists in 14 World Cup appearances, including 
4 goals and 7 assists in 1970.[189] Pelé shares with Uwe Seeler and Miroslav 
Klose the achievement of being the only three footballers to have scored 
in four separate World Cup tournaments.[190] Pelé numbers differ between 
sources mostly due to friendly games. The RSSSF states that Pelé scored 
767 goals in 831 official games, 1281 goals in 1365 overall while he was 
active, 1284 in 1375 taking into account benefit games after retirement.[192] 
The following table is a compendium of sources that include Santos and 
FIFA among others.[43][193] CERTIDÃO DE NASCIMENTO CERTIFICO que sob o

that he was actually named Edson and that he was born on 23 October 1940. 
Pelé; Duarte, Orlando; Bellos, Alex (2006). Pelé: The Autobiography. London: 
Simon & Schuster UK. p. 14. ISBN 978-0-7432-7582-8. Shortly before I came 
along, there was another arrival in Três Corações: electricity. In order 
to celebrate this great improvement to our daily lives, Dondinho named 
me Edson, a tribute to Thomas Edison, the inventor of the lightbulb. In 
fact, on my birth certificate I am actually called Edison with an 'i', 
a mistake that persists to this day. I'm Edson with no 'i', but to my eternal 
annoyance quite often the 'i' appears on official or personal documents 
and time after time I have to explain why. As if that wasn't confusing 
enough, they got the date wrong on my birth certificate as well – it says 
21 October. I'm not sure how this came about; probably because in Brazil 
we're not so fussy about accuracy. This is another mistake that carries 
on to this day. When I took out my first passport, the date was put in 
as 21 October and each time I have renewed it the date has stayed the same.
