John A. "Jocko" Flynn (June 30, 1864 in Lawrence, Massachusetts â€“ December 
31, 1907 in Lawrence, Massachusetts) was a Major League Baseball player 
for the World Champion Chicago White Stockings who played pitcher only 
in the 1886 season, during which the team again won the National League 
championship. Flynn's 23 victories were the most ever logged by a pitcher 
who only pitched a single season in the major leagues. During this rookie 
year, Flynn developed arm problems which prevented him from appearing in 
the 1886 World Series, a best of seven contest that was ultimately won 
by he St. Louis Browns of the American Association, four games to two.[1] 
Flynn's loss was painfully felt by the club, who also saw pitcher Jim McCormick 
go down after the second game of the series with a chronic foot ailment.[2] 
Teams of the era typically only carried three pitchers and the loss of 
both Flynn and McCormick left the Chicagos with only their ace, future 
Hall of Famer John Clarkson, who was forced to start four of the six contests, 
going the distance in three.[3] Flynn was very small of stature, so much 
so that he was mistaken for the Chicago team mascot, Willie Hahn, and taunted 
by St. Louis fans after game 4 of the World Series.[4] Flynn's arm ailment 
kept him from pitching again. His 23 wins is the most ever by a pitcher
