Recreation Park was the name applied to several former baseball parks in 
San Francisco, California in the late 19th Century and early 20th Century. 
Recreation Grounds, opening on November 26, 1868 and operated until May 
1884, and was San Francisco's first professional enclosed ballpark. Located 
at the terminus of a railcar line in San Francisco's heavily Irish Mission 
District, at the present day Garfield Square.[1][2] The ballpark was bordered 
by the streets Harrison, Twenty-Sixth, Folsom and Twenty-Fifth.[3] The 
opening day ceremonies included the second game of the California baseball 
championship series between the Oakland Wide Awakes and the San Francisco 
Eagles who won by the score of 37-23. The days festivities included an 
operatic concert and footraces and were attended by a crowd of 4,000 people.[4]

recreation grounds existed in the Haight, with ownership transferred to 
J.B. Gilbert of the Central league on September 8, 1893.[6] and was also 
referred to as Haight-Street Recreation Park located between Stanyan, Waller, 
Cole and Frederic Streets was closed in 1895.[7] Recreation Park, also 
known as Central Park, seating capacity of 15,000, opened on Thanksgiving 
Day of 1884[8] and operated until 1906.[9] Located at 8th Street and Market 
Streets, was used by several clubs including the San Francisco Seals of 
the Pacific Coast League from 1903. Destroyed by the earthquake and fire 
on April 18, 1906. The Seals temporarily moved to Oakland while the city 
of San Francisco was being rebuilt. Photo. Recreation Park, located in

ballparks. It was the home of the Seals during 1907-13 and then 1915-30 
after a one-year experiment playing at newly built Ewing Park near the 
Richmond District. The experiment was a fiasco, largely because of the 
cold and foggy summer weather endemic to western San Francisco. The Oaks, 
in turn, had essentially moved into Recreation Park in 1907 and played 
most of their games there (except Thursdays and Sunday mornings) until 
their new Oaks Park was opened in 1913, although they continued to play 
some games in San Francisco until sometime in the 1920s. This congenial 
arrangement was made easier by the fact that J. Cal Ewing, founding father 
of the PCL, owned both clubs for their first couple of decades. The ballpark 
sat 15,000. It also become the home of the Mission Reds (a.k.a. "Missions") 
upon their arrival in 1926. The Chicago White Sox held spring training 
at Recreation Park in 1909 and 1910.[10][11] This final incarnation of 
Recreation Park was on a block bounded by 14th Street (north, right field); 
Valencia Street (east, first base); 15th Street (south, third base); and 
Guerrero Street (west, left field) 37°46′2.7″N 122°25′23.32″W﻿ / ﻿37.767417°N

an unusual design, with a small lower deck topped directly above (thus 
protected from the weather) by a large upper deck, much of which was unroofed 
and open to the sunshine and the elements. The stands were also made of 
wood. A new, concrete ballpark called Seals Stadium a mile east of Recreation 
Park, opened in 1931 as the new home of both the Seals and the Missions. 
Recreation Park was demolished and the site was converted into a public
