George Marshall Kissell (9 September 1920 – 7 October 2008) was an American 
baseball minor league player, manager, coach, scout, and instructor, as 
well as a Major League coach, for the St. Louis Cardinals organization. 
Born in Evans Mills, New York, he graduated from Evans Mills High School 
and attended Ithaca College, where he earned both bachelor's and master's 
degrees in history and physical education. As a player he stood 5'8" (173 cm) 
tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg). He threw and batted right-handed.[1] 
Kissell was signed as an infielder in 1940 by Branch Rickey, and spent 
69 years with the Cardinals organization. He was primarily a third baseman, 
although he also played shortstop, and never rose above the Class B level 
as a player. By 1946, after three seasons in the military during World 
War II, he had become a playing manager for the Lawrence Millionaires of 
the Class B New England League. His most successful season as a manager 
came in 1950 with the Class B Winston-Salem Cardinals, who won 106 of 153 
regular-season games and the Carolina League playoff championship. Kissell 
managed in the Cardinal farm system through 1957, scouted for them in 1958–62, 
then returned to the field as a minor league manager in 1963–67. In 1968, 
he spent his first season as a roving instructor in the Cardinal system, 
where his efforts led to the nickname of "the Professor," and his influence 
is generally regarded as being a major basis for what came to be known 
as the "Cardinal Way".[2] He mentored a number of major league managers, 
including Sparky Anderson, Joe Torre, and Tony LaRussa.[3] Kissell received 
numerous honors for his work in baseball, including induction into the 
Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 2003.[3] In recognition for his years of 
service to the game, Kissell received the King of Baseball award in 1993 
from minor league baseball. In addition, the Cardinals' spring training 
clubhouse in Jupiter, Florida was named after him during spring training 
in 2005. The Cardinals organization annually honors a minor league coach 
with the George Kissell Award.[2] In 2015 Kissel was inducted into the 
St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame.[4] In the middle of his long career as 
a minor league manager and farm system official, Kissell spent seven seasons 
with the Major League Cardinals (1969–75) as a third-base coach on the 
staff of skipper Red Schoendienst. In his final decades with St. Louis, 
he served as field coordinator of system-wide instruction, then senior 
field coordinator. Said former Cardinal manager Whitey Herzog in 2005, 
“He is one of those baseball lifers that loves to talk baseball ... George 
Kissell is the only man I know who can talk for 15 minutes about a ground 
ball.”[5] At the age of 88, Kissell died after sustaining injuries in a
