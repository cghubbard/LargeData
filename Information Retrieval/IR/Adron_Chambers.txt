Adron Lamar Chambers (born October 8, 1986) is an American professional 
baseball outfielder who is currently a free agent. He has played in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals. Prior to playing professionally, 
Chambers attended Pensacola High School where he was the star quarterback 
for his team. He went on to attend Mississippi State University on a football 
scholarship before resuming his baseball career at Pensacola Junior College. 
He was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 38th round of the 2007 
amateur draft. He began his professional career in 2007, playing for the 
Johnson City Cardinals, hitting .279 in 36 games. In 2008, he played for 
the Quad Cities River Bandits, hitting .238 with 13 stolen bases in 95 
games. He played for the Palm Beach Cardinals in 2009, hitting .283 with 
21 stolen bases and 16 triples in 122 games. He split 2010 between the 
Springfield Cardinals (75 games) and Memphis Redbirds (37 games), hitting 
a combined .283 with 14 stolen bases in 112 games.[1] On September 6, 2011, 
Chambers was called up to play for the St. Louis Cardinals. On September 
16, 2011, during his second major league at-bat, Chambers earned his first 
Major League hit which brought in the go ahead runs for the Cardinals to 
beat the Phillies. Chambers, who had been brought in as a defensive sub 
for Lance Berkman attempted an inside the park home run, but was tagged 
out at the plate. Nevertheless, he was credited with a triple off of Michael 
Schwimer who had walked Albert Pujols in order to get to Chambers.[2] Chambers 
was also noted for his contributions off the field to help spur the Cardinals 
on during their quest to win the Wild Card playoff berth. With the Cardinals' 
playoff hopes looking much in doubt prior to the bottom of the ninth inning 
during their game on September 24, 2011 against arch-rival Chicago Cubs, 
Chambers was shown on the WGN television broadcast of the game taking it 
upon himself to encourage and excite the hometown fans to join him in cheering 
for the team prior to the start of the inning.[3] Incredibly, the Cardinals 
began to rally, and Chambers himself was then inserted into the game as 
a pinch-runner, where he proceeded to score the winning run during a wild 
pitch.[4] That down-to-the wire win was one of many that month that helped 
the Cardinals earn their playoff berth. On October 28, 2011 Adron Chambers 
was added to the St. Louis Cardinals World Series roster as an emergency 
replacement for the injured Matt Holliday before game 7 of the 2011 World 
Series against the Texas Rangers. [1] After splitting time between St. 
Louis and the team's minor league system in 2012 and 2013, Chambers was 
out-righted off the Cardinals roster on November 5, 2013 and elected free 
agency. In 2013 he had four hits in 26 at bats with St. Louis. He was kept 
on the Cardinals active roster through the 2013 National League Divisional 
Series and the 2013 National League Championship Series.[5] Chambers signed 
a minor league deal with the Houston Astros in November 2013. He played 
in 17 games with the Astros during Spring Training before being assigned 
to the Triple-A Oklahoma City RedHawks to begin 2014. He was the team's 
Opening Day center-fielder and leadoff hitter, but injured himself on a 
slide, dislocating his left ring finger in the 4th inning, and he was placed 
on the disabled list.[6] He was activated on May 11 and played that day. 
In 25 games for the RedHawks, Chambers hit .281 with 2 HR and 15 RBI. On 
June 12, Chambers was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for two minor leaguers, 
LHP Alejandro Solarte and 2B Will Dupont.[7][8] The Blue Jays assigned 
him to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. On December 23, 2014 Chambers signed 
with the Chicago Cubs on a minor league deal. On June 13, 2016, Chambers 
signed with the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League of Professional 
Baseball. He was released on July 26, 2016. On August 12, 2016, Chambers 
signed with the Ottawa Champions of the Can-Am League.[9] He won the Championship 
title with the Champions, defeating the Rockland Boulders 3-2 in a best
