Dominic Joseph Leone (born October 26, 1991) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He made his MLB debut for the Seattle Mariners in 2014. Prior to 
playing professionally, Leone played college baseball for the Clemson Tigers. 
Leone attended Norwich Free Academy in Norwich, Connecticut, where he played 
for the school's baseball team.[1] He then enrolled at Clemson University, 
where he pitched for the Clemson Tigers baseball team.[2][3] As a true 
freshman, the Tigers turned to Leone in a game where the Tigers faced postseason 
elimination; Leone won the game, which sent the Tigers to the 2010 College 
World Series.[3] A strained shoulder in his sophomore year led him to develop 
his off-speed pitches.[4] In his junior year, he had a 7–4 win–loss record 
and a 5.25 earned run average.[5] While strugging in his junior year, Leone 
taught himself to throw a cutter by watching YouTube videos of Mariano 
Rivera.[6] The Mariners selected Leone in the 16th round of the 2012 Major 
League Baseball Draft.[7] He signed with the Mariners, receiving a $100,000 
signing bonus.[5] The Mariners assigned him to the Everett AquaSox of Class 
A-Short Season New York–Penn League.[8] In 2013, Leone began the season 
with the Clinton LumberKings of the Class A Midwest League. After pitching 
6 1⁄3 scoreless innings for Clinton, the Mariners promoted Leone to the 
High Desert Mavericks of the Class A-Advanced California League, and served 
as their closer.[9] Following the 2013 season, the Mariners assigned Leone 
to the Arizona Fall League.[10] On April 4, 2014, the Mariners selected 
Leone's contract from the Tacoma Rainiers of the Class AAA Pacific Coast 
League, promoting him to the major leagues.[7] He pitched to a 8–2 win–loss 
record and a 2.17 ERA with 70 strikeouts in 67 games pitched in 2014.[11] 
During spring training in 2015, Leone struggled with his command, and the 
Mariners assigned him to Tacoma at the beginning of the 2015 season.[12] 
When the Mariners placed Tom Wilhelmsen on the disabled list in early April, 
the Mariners promoted Leone.[11] He pitched to a 6.35 ERA in 11 1⁄3 innings 
for the Mariners, before they traded him with Welington Castillo, Gabby 
Guerrero, and Jack Reinheimer to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Mark Trumbo
