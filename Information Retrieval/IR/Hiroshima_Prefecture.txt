Hiroshima Prefecture (広島県, Hiroshima-ken?) is a prefecture of Japan located 
in the Chūgoku region on Honshu island.[1] The capital is the city of Hiroshima.[2] 
It has a population of around 2.8 million. The area around Hiroshima was 
formerly divided into Bingo Province and Aki Province.[3] This location 
has been a center of trade and culture since the beginning of Japan's recorded 
history. Hiroshima is a traditional center of the Chūgoku region and was 
the seat of the Mōri clan until the Battle of Sekigahara. Hiroshima is 
home to two UNESCO World Heritage sites: Hiroshima prefecture lies in the 
middle of Chūgoku. Most of the prefecture consists of mountains leading 
towards Shimane Prefecture; and rivers produce rich plains near the coast. 
The province faces Shikoku across the Seto Inland Sea. Hiroshima Bay opens 
on the Inland Sea.[4] The prefecture also includes many small islands. 
The sheltered nature of the Inland Sea makes Hiroshima's climate very mild. 
As of 1 April 2014, 4% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated 
as Natural Parks (the lowest percentage of any prefecture), namely Setonaikai 
National Park; Hiba-Dōgo-Taishaku and Nishi-Chūgoku Sanchi Quasi-National 
Parks; and six Prefectural Natural Parks.[5] Fourteen cities are located 
in Hiroshima Prefecture: These are the towns in each district: Hiroshima's 
main industries include automobiles (Mazda is headquartered there) and 
shipbuilding (Kure was one of the main naval bases of the Imperial Japanese 
Navy and remains a major commercial yard). The sports teams listed below
