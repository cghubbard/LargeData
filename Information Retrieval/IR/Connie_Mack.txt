As Player As Manager Cornelius McGillicuddy (December 22, 1862 – February 
8, 1956), better known as Connie Mack, was an American professional baseball 
player, manager, and team owner. The longest-serving manager in Major League 
Baseball history, he holds records for wins (3,731), losses (3,948), and 
games managed (7,755), with his victory total being almost 1,000 more than 
any other manager. Mack managed the Philadelphia Athletics for the club's 
first 50 seasons of play, starting in 1901, before retiring at age 87 following 
the 1950 season, and was at least part-owner from 1901 to 1954. He was 
the first manager to win the World Series three times, and is the only 
manager to win consecutive Series on separate occasions (1910–11, 1929–30); 
his five Series titles remain the third most by any manager, and his nine 
American League pennants rank second in league history. However, constant 
financial struggles forced repeated rebuilding of the roster, and Mack's 
teams also finished in last place 17 times. Mack was elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1937. Mack was born Cornelius McGillicuddy in East Brookfield, 
Massachusetts on December 22, 1862.[1] As with many Irish immigrants whose 
names began with "Mc", the McGullicuddys were often referred to as "Mack", 
except for official and legal documents.[2] His parents, Michael McGillicuddy 
and Mary McKillop, were both immigrants from Ireland.[3] Michael McGillicuddy's 
father was named Cornelius McGillicuddy, and by tradition, the family named 
at least one son in each generation Cornelius.[4] "Connie" is a common 
nickname for Cornelius, so Cornelius McGillicuddy was called "Connie Mack" 
from an early age.[5] Connie Mack never legally changed his name; on the 
occasion of his second marriage at age 48, he signed the wedding register 
as "Cornelius McGillicuddy".[6] His nickname on the baseball field was 
"Slats", for his height of 6 feet 2 inches and thin build.[7] Mack's father 
became a wheelwright. During the American Civil War, he served with the 
51st Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment.[8] Michael McGillicuddy 
suffered from several ailments as the result of his military service; he 
was able to work only infrequently, and drew a disability pension.[9] Mack 
was educated in East Brookfield, and began working summers in local cotton 
mills at age 9 to help support his family.[10] He quit school after completing 
the eighth grade at age 14, intending to work full-time to contribute to 
the family's support, as several of his siblings had done.[11] He clerked 
at a store, worked on local farms, and worked on the production lines of 
the shoe factories in nearby towns.[12] Mack was also a good athlete, and 
frequently played baseball and some of its predecessor games with local 
players in East Brookfield.[13] In 1879 his skills landed him a place on 
East Brookfield's town team, which played other town teams in the area. 
Though younger than his teammates by several years, Mack was the team's 
catcher and de facto captain.[14] Beginning in 1886, Mack played 10 seasons 
in the National League and one in the Players' League, for a total of 11 
seasons in the major leagues, almost entirely as a catcher. Beginning in 
1884, he played on minor league teams in the Connecticut cities of Meriden 
and Hartford before being sold to the Washington (DC) team of the National 
League (variously called the Statesmen, Nationals, or Senators) in 1886.[15] 
In the winter of 1889, he jumped to the Buffalo team of the new Players' 
League, the Bisons, investing his entire life savings of $500 in shares 
in that club.[16] But the Players' League went out of business after only 
a year, and Mack lost his job and his whole investment. In December 1890 
Mack signed a contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League 
and remained with them for the rest of his career as a full-time player.[17] 
As a player, Mack was "a light-hitting catcher with a reputation as a smart 
player, but didn't do anything particularly well as a player."[18] Mack 
was one of the first catchers to position himself directly behind home 
plate instead of in front of the backstop. According to Wilbert Robinson, 
"Mack never was mean ... [but] if you had any soft spot, Connie would find 
it. He could do and say things that got more under your skin than the cuss 
words used by other catchers." In addition to verbally needling batters 
to distract them, he developed skills such as blocking the plate to prevent 
base runners from scoring and faking the sound of a foul tip. (He was probably 
responsible for the 1891 rule change requiring that a batter must have 
two strikes against him in order to be called out if the catcher caught 
a foul tip.)[19] Besides tipping bats to fake the sound of a foul tip, 
Mack became adept at tipping bats to throw off the hitter's swing. ("Tipping" 
a bat is to brush it with the catcher's mitt as the batter swings, either 
delaying the swing or putting it off course, so that the batter misses 
the ball or doesn't hit it solidly. If the umpire is aware that a bat has 
been tipped, whether intentionally or unintentionally, he calls catcher's 
interference.) Mack never denied such tricks: Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder 
for Louisville. I tipped his bat several times when he had two strikes 
on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out. He got even, 
though. One time there were two strikes on him and he swung as the pitch 
was coming in. But he didn't swing at the ball. He swung right at my wrists. 
Sometimes I think I can still feel the pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip 
his bat again. No, sir, not until the last game of the season and Weaver 
was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat 
again and got away with it.[20] Mack's last three seasons in the National 
League were as a player-manager with the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1894 to 
1896, with a 149–134 (.527) record. Fired on September 21, 1896,[21] he 
retired as a full-time player and accepted a deal from Henry Killilea to 
act as manager and occasional backup catcher for the minor league Milwaukee 
Brewers. He agreed to a salary of $3,000 and 25% of the club.[22] He managed 
the Brewers for four seasons from 1897 to 1900, their best year coming 
in 1900, when they finished second. It was in Milwaukee that he first signed 
pitcher Rube Waddell, who would follow him to the big leagues. In 1901 
Mack became manager, treasurer and part owner of the new American League's 
Philadelphia Athletics.[23] He managed the Athletics through the 1950 season, 
compiling a record of 3,582–3,814 (.484) when he retired at 87. Mack won 
nine pennants and appeared in eight World Series, winning five. Mack's 
50-year tenure as Athletics manager is the most ever for a coach or manager 
with the same team in North American professional sports, and has never 
been seriously threatened. A few college coaches had longer tenures: Eddie 
Robinson, was college football coach Grambling State for 57 seasons, from 
1941 (when it was known as the Louisiana Negro Normal and Industrial Institute) 
to 1997. Joe Paterno, with 62 seasons as a college football coach for the 
Penn State Nittany Lions also surpassed Mack, although Paterno was head 
coach in only 46 of those years. Mack was widely praised in the newspapers 
for his intelligent and innovative managing, which earned him the nickname 
"the Tall Tactician". He valued intelligence and "baseball smarts," always 
looking for educated players. (He traded away Shoeless Joe Jackson despite 
his talent because of his bad attitude and unintelligent play.[24]) "Better 
than any other manager, Mack understood and promoted intelligence as an 
element of excellence."[25] He wanted men who were self-directed, self-disciplined 
and self-motivated; his ideal player was Eddie Collins.[26] According to 
baseball historian Bill James, Mack was well ahead of his time in having 
numerous college players on his teams. Several of his players went on to 
become well-respected college coaches. Jack Coombs, the ace of Mack's 1910-11 
champions, became the longtime coach at Duke. Andy Coakley, who won 20 
games for Mack's 1905 pennant winners, coached for over 30 years at Columbia, 
where he was the college coach for Lou Gehrig. Dick Siebert, longtime coach 
at Minnesota, played for Mack from 1938 to 1945. James believed that Mack's 
influence on the game, as great as it was, would have been even greater 
had the college game been more popular during the 1920s and 1930s, when 
Mack was at his peak.[27] According to James, Mack looked for seven things 
in his players--"physical ability, intelligence, courage, disposition, 
will power, general alertness and personal habits."[25] As a result of 
Mack's striving to have his players become better people as well as baseball 
players, he created a Code of Conduct following the 1916 season[28] He 
also looked for players with quiet and disciplined personal lives, having 
seen many players in his playing days destroy themselves and their teams 
through heavy drinking. Mack himself never drank; before the 1910 World 
Series he asked all his players to "take the pledge" not to drink during 
the Series. When Topsy Hartsel told Mack he needed a drink the night before 
the final game, Mack told him to do what he thought best, but in these 
circumstances "if it was me, I'd die before I took a drink."[29] In any 
event, his managerial style was not tyrannical but easygoing.[30] He never 
imposed curfews or bed checks, and made the best of what he had. Rube Waddell 
was the best pitcher and biggest gate attraction of Mack's first decade 
as the A's manager, so he put up with his drinking and general unreliability 
for years, until it began to bring the team down and the other players 
asked Mack to get rid of Waddell. [31] Mack's strength as a manager was 
finding the best players, teaching them well and letting them play. "He 
did not believe that baseball revolved around managerial strategy."[25] 
He was "one of the first managers to work on repositioning his fielders" 
during the game, often directing the outfielders to move left or right, 
play shallow or deep, by waving his rolled-up scorecard from the bench.[25] 
After he became well known for doing this, he often passed his instructions 
to the fielders by way of other players, and simply waved his scorecard 
as a feint.[32] James summed up Mack's managerial approach as follows: 
he favored a set lineup, did not generally platoon hitters; preferred young 
players to veterans and power hitters to those with high batting averages; 
did not often pinch-hit, use his bench players or sacrifice much (even 
so, the A's led the league in sacrifice bunts in 1909, 1911 and 1914); 
believed in "big-inning" offense rather than small ball; and very rarely 
issued an intentional walk.[33] Over the course of his career, he had nine 
pennant-winning teams spanning three peak periods or "dynasties." His original 
team, with players such as Rube Waddell, Ossee Schrecongost, and Eddie 
Plank, won the pennant in 1902 (when there was no World Series) and 1905. 
They lost the 1905 World Series to the New York Giants (four games to one, 
all shutouts, with Christy Mathewson hurling three shutouts for a record 
27 scoreless innings in one World Series). During that season, Giants manager 
John McGraw said that Mack had "a big white elephant on his hands" with 
the Athletics. Mack defiantly adopted the white elephant as the team's 
logo, which the Athletics still use today. As that first team aged, Mack 
acquired a core of young players to form his second great team, which featured 
Mack's famous "$100,000 infield" of Eddie Collins, Home Run Baker, Jack 
Barry and Stuffy McInnis. These Athletics, captained by catcher Ira Thomas, 
won the pennant in 1910, 1911, 1913 and 1914, beating the Cubs in the World 
Series in 1910 and the Giants in 1911 and 1913, but losing in 1914 in four 
straight games to the "Miracle" Boston Braves, who had come from last place 
in late July to win the National League pennant by 6 1/2 games over the 
Giants. That team was dispersed due to financial problems, from which Mack 
did not recover until the twenties, when he built his third great team. 
The 1927 Athletics featured several future Hall of Fame players including 
veterans Ty Cobb, Zack Wheat and Eddie Collins as well as young stars like 
Mickey Cochrane, Lefty Grove, Al Simmons and rookie Jimmie Foxx. That team 
won the pennant in 1929, 1930 and 1931, beating the Chicago Cubs in the 
1929 World Series (when they came from 8–0 behind in Game 4, plating a 
Series record ten runs in the seventh inning and winning the game, 10–8, 
and then from two runs down in the bottom of the ninth in Game 5 for a 
walk-off Series win) and easily defeating the St. Louis Cardinals in 1930. 
The following year, St. Louis beat the A's in seven games led by the brilliant 
Pepper Martin. That team was dispersed after 1932 when Mack ran into financial 
difficulty again. By 1934, the A's had fallen into the second division. 
Although Mack intended to rebuild for a third time, he would never win 
another pennant. The Athletics' record from 1935 to 1946 was dismal, finishing 
in the basement of the AL every year except a 5th-place finish in 1944. 
World War II brought further hardship due to personnel shortages. In 1938, 
Mack in his middle seventies successfully battled a blood infection caused 
when a batted ball injured one of his shinbones. He stopped for treatment 
at the Medical and Surgical Hospital in San Antonio, Texas, where he was 
in passage on a train.[34] In addition, as Mack entered his 80s, his once-keen 
mind began fading rapidly. Mack would make strange decisions (which his 
coaches and players usually overruled), make inexplicable outbursts, and 
call for players from decades earlier to pinch-hit. He spent most games 
asleep in the dugout, leaving his coaches to run the team most of the time.[35] 
According to outfielder Sam Chapman, "He could remember the old-timers, 
but he had a hard time remembering the names of the current players." Shortstop 
Eddie Joost said "He wasn't senile, but there were lapses." Despite growing 
speculation he would step down, Mack brushed it all off and stated simply 
that he would keep managing as long as he was physically able to do so.[36] 
According to Bill James, by the time Mack recovered again financially, 
he was "old and out of touch with the game, so his career ends with eighteen 
years of miserable baseball."[37] It was generally agreed that he stayed 
in the game too long, hurting his legacy.[38] He was unable to handle the 
post-World War II changes in baseball, including the growing commercialization 
of the game. His business style was no longer viable in post-World War 
II America due to various factors, including the increased expense of running 
a team. For instance, he never installed a telephone line between the bullpen 
and dugout. Despite the circumstances, the octogenarian Mack led the team 
to three winning seasons in 1947–49 (including a fourth-place finish in 
1948). With the A's unexpected resurgence in 1947-49, there was hope that 
1950—Mack's 50th anniversary as A's manager—would bring a pennant at last. 
However, the A's never recovered from a dreadful May in which they only 
won five games. By May 26, the A's were 11-21, 12 games out of first, and 
it was obvious the season was a lost cause. On that date, his sons Earle, 
Roy and Connie, Jr. persuaded their father to promote Dykes, who had been 
a coach since 1949, to assistant manager for the remainder of the season. 
Dykes became the team's main operator in the dugout, and would take over 
the managerial reins in his own right in 1951. At the same time, Cochrane 
was named general manager—thus stripping Connie, Sr. of his remaining authority.[35] 
"Toward the end he was old and sick and saddened, a figure of forlorn dignity 
bewildered by the bickering around him as the baseball monument that he 
had built crumbled away."[39] At the time of his retirement, Mack stated: 
"I'm not quitting because I'm getting old, I'm quitting because I think 
people want me to."[40] The American League's white knight, Charles Somers, 
provided the seed money to start the Athletics and several other American 
League teams. However, plans called for local interests to buy out Somers 
as soon as possible. To that end, Mack persuaded sporting goods manufacturer 
Ben Shibe, a minority owner of the rival Philadelphia Phillies, to buy 
a 50 percent stake in the team—an offer sweetened by Mack's promise that 
Shibe would have the exclusive right to make baseballs for the American 
League. In return, Mack was allowed to buy a 25 percent stake, and was 
named treasurer of the team. Two local sports writers, Frank Hough and 
Sam Jones, bought the remaining 25 percent, but their involvement was not 
mentioned in the incorporating papers; in fact, no agreement was put on 
paper until 1902. Mack and Shibe did business on a handshake.[23][42] In 
1913, Hough and Jones sold their 25 percent to Mack, making him a full 
partner in the club with Shibe; Mack actually borrowed the money for the 
purchase from Shibe.[43] Under their agreement, Mack had full control over 
baseball matters while Shibe handled the business side. When Shibe died 
in 1922, his sons Tom and John took over management of the business side, 
with Tom as team president and John as vice president. Tom died in 1936, 
and John resigned shortly thereafter, leaving Mack to take over the presidency. 
John Shibe died in 1937, and Mack bought 141 shares from his estate, enough 
to make him majority owner of the A's. However, he had been operating head 
of the franchise since Ben Shibe's death. Such an arrangement is no longer 
possible in current times, as major-league rules do not allow a coach or 
manager to own any financial interest in a club. Mack's great strength 
as an owner was his huge network of baseball friends, all of whom acted 
as scouts and "bird-dogs" for him, finding talented players and alerting 
Mack. "Mack was better at that game than anybody else in the world. People 
liked Mack, respected him, and trusted him. ... Mack answered every letter 
and listened patiently to every sales job, and ... he got players for that 
reason."[44] Mack saw baseball as a business, and recognized that economic 
necessity drove the game. He explained to his cousin, Art Dempsey, that 
"The best thing for a team financially is to be in the running and finish 
second. If you win, the players all expect raises." This was one reason 
he was constantly collecting players, signing almost anyone to a ten-day 
contract to assess his talent; he was looking ahead to future seasons when 
his veterans would either retire or hold out for bigger salaries than Mack 
could give them. Unlike most baseball owners, Mack had almost no income 
apart from the A's. Even when he collected rent from the Phillies, he was 
often in financial difficulties. Money problems—the escalation of his best 
players' salaries (due both to their success and to competition from the 
new, well-financed Federal League), combined with a steep drop in attendance 
due to World War I—led to the gradual dispersal of his second championship 
team, the 1910–1914 team, who he sold, traded, or released over the years 
1915–1917. The war hurt the team badly, leaving Mack without the resources 
to sign valuable players. His 1916 team, with a 36–117 record, is often 
considered the worst team in American League history, and its .235 winning 
percentage is still the lowest ever for a modern-era (since 1900) major 
league team. The team's 117 losses set a modern era record and at the time 
was the second most losses behind the Cleveland Spiders' 130 in 1899. As 
of 2012 that record has been topped only twice, with the 1962 New York 
Mets breaking that record with 120 losses in their inaugural season and 
the 2003 Detroit Tigers surpassing it with 119 although those teams played 
162 game schedules, not 154 like the Athletics. All told, the A's finished 
dead last in the AL seven years in a row from 1915 to 1921, and would not 
reach .500 again until 1926. The rebuilt team won back-to-back championships 
in 1929–1930 over the Cubs and Cardinals, and then lost a rematch with 
the latter in 1931. As it turned out, these were the last postseason appearances 
for the A's not only in Philadelphia, but for another four decades. Unlike 
with the breakup of his second great team, the A's didn't tumble out of 
contention right away. They remained fairly competitive for most of the 
first half of the 1930s. However, after 1933, they would only tally four 
more winning seasons during their stay in Philadelphia—which would be the 
franchise's only winning seasons for 35 years. With the onset of the Great 
Depression, Mack struggled financially again, and was forced to sell the 
best players from his second great championship team, such as Lefty Grove 
and Jimmie Foxx, to stay in business. Although Mack wanted to rebuild again 
and win more championships, he was never able to do so owing to a lack 
of funds. Even before then, he either did not (or could not) invest in 
a farm system. Mack celebrated his 70th birthday in 1932, and many began 
wondering if his best days were behind him. Even as bad as the A's got 
during the next two decades, he stubbornly retained full control over baseball 
matters long after most teams had hired a general manager. This continued 
even after he became majority owner, despite calls both inside and outside 
Philadelphia to step down.[35] Indeed, one of the few times that Mack considered 
giving up even some of his duties was in the 1934-35 offseason—when the 
A's were still not far removed from what would be their last great era. 
He briefly entertained replacing himself as manager with Babe Ruth, but 
ruled that idea out, saying that the Babe's wife, Claire, would be running 
the team inside of a month.[45] In the early 1940s, Mack gave a minority 
stake in the team to his three sons, Roy, Earle, and Connie, Jr. Although 
Roy and Earle had never gotten along with Connie, Jr., who was more than 
20 years younger than them, Connie, Sr. intended to have all three of them 
inherit the team after his death or retirement. This strategy backfired 
when Roy and Earle refused to consider Connie, Jr.'s demands to end the 
team's bargain-basement way of doing business. One of the few things on 
which they agreed was that it was time for their father to step down. Connie, 
Jr. was only able to force through other minor improvements to the team 
and the rapidly crumbling Shibe Park through an alliance with the Shibe 
heirs. When it became apparent that his older brothers weren't willing 
to go further, Connie, Jr. and the Shibes decided to sell the team. However, 
Roy and Earle countered by buying out their younger brother, persuading 
their father to support them. In order to pull off the deal, however, they 
mortgaged the team to the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (now 
part of CIGNA). Yearly payments of $200,000 drained the team of badly needed 
capital, and ended any realistic chance of the A's winning again under 
the Macks' stewardship.[35] When Mack resigned as manager, he largely withdrew 
from active control of the team. Over the next five years, the team crumbled 
to the bottom of the American League. Although reduced to a figurehead, 
Mack continued to be treated with awe and reverence by players who considered 
him living history. His sons handled his correspondence by 1953 as he had 
become too frail by that point to do it himself. As that year ended, the 
A's were dangerously close to bankruptcy. The other American League owners 
had been concerned for some time about the situation in Philadelphia, since 
the crowds at Shibe Park had dwindled to the point that visiting teams 
couldn't meet their expenses for traveling there. The 1954 A's attracted 
only 304,000 people, nowhere near enough to break even. The other owners, 
as well as league president Will Harridge, wanted the Athletics sold off 
to a new owner. The Yankees in particular lobbied for it to be Chicago 
businessman Arnold Johnson, who had recently bought both Yankee Stadium 
as well as Blues Stadium in Kansas City, home to the Yankees' top farm 
team. Roy and Earle Mack did not want to move the team, but pressure from 
the Yankees and blowback from several bad business decisions finally moved 
their hand and they agreed to the sale. A final attempt to sell the A's 
to Philadelphia car dealer John Crisconi briefly gained Mack's support, 
but collapsed at the eleventh hour—reportedly due to behind-the-scenes 
intrigue by the Yankees. When that deal collapsed, a bitter Mack wrote 
a letter blasting his fellow owners for sinking the Crisconi deal. However, 
he admitted that he didn't have nearly enough money to run the A's in 1955, 
and conceded that the Johnson deal was the only one with a chance of approval.[35] 
In early November, Mack agreed to sell the A's to Johnson for $1.5 million. 
When the AL owners met in New York to discuss the sale to Johnson, they 
voted 5-3 to approve the sale. Johnson immediately requested permission 
to move to Kansas City, which was granted after Detroit's Spike Briggs 
switched his vote.[35] Although Mack had long since conceded that his 55 
years in the American League were over, his doctor reported that the nonagenarian 
owner suffered a sudden sharp drop in blood pressure and almost expired 
upon learning that his team was gone.[46] The A's sold Shibe Park, now 
renamed Connie Mack Stadium, to the Phillies. Mack was still chauffeured 
around to games by his caretaker. He attended the 1954 World Series and 
the occasional regular season game, but in October 1955, he fell and suffered 
a hip fracture. Mack underwent surgery on October 5, missing the World 
Series that week for the first time ever. He remained wheelchair-bound 
after that point, celebrating his 93rd birthday in November. The end came 
at his daughter's house on the afternoon of February 8, 1956. According 
to his doctor, he'd been fine until the 7th when he "just started to fade 
away". Officially, it was announced that he died of "old age and complications 
from his hip surgery"[47] Mack's funeral was held in his parish church, 
St. Bridget's, and he was buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Cheltenham 
Township just outside Philadelphia, with Commissioner Ford Frick, the AL 
and NL presidents, and all 16 MLB owners serving as pallbearers. Mack was 
quiet, even-tempered, and gentlemanly, never using profanity. He was generally 
addressed as "Mr. Mack". He always called his players by their given names. 
Chief Bender, for instance, was "Albert" to Mack. Perhaps due to his great 
longevity in the game, there grew up around him a kind of saintly image; 
his long-time friends objected to the image of him as "the bloodless saint 
so often painted, a sanctimonious old Puritan patting babies".[48] His 
friend Red Smith called him "tough and warm and wonderful, kind and stubborn 
and courtly and unreasonable and generous and calculating and naive and 
gentle and proud and humorous and demanding and unpredictable".[48] Beginning 
as far back as his first managing job in the nineteenth century, Mack drew 
criticism from the newspapers for not spending enough money. Some writers 
called him an outright miser, accusing him of getting rid of star players 
so he could "line his own pockets" with the money. However, his biographer 
Norman Macht strongly defends Mack on this question, contending that Mack's 
spending decisions were forced on him by his financial circumstances, and 
that nearly all the money he made went back to the team. Mack himself was 
upset by these allegations: when some writers accused him of deliberately 
losing the second game of the 1913 World Series in order to extend the 
series and make more money in ticket sales, he uncharacteristically wrote 
an angry letter to the Saturday Evening Post to deny it, saying "I consider 
playing for the gate receipts ... nothing short of dishonest." With the 
Athletics leading the Series three games to one, several New York writers 
predicted that the Athletics would deliberately lose Game Five in New York 
so that Mack would not have to refund the $50,000 in ticket sales for Game 
Six in Philadelphia. After reading this, Mack told his players that if 
they won Game Five he would give them the team's entire share of the Game 
Five gate receipts — about $34,000. The Athletics won the Game and the 
series, and Mack gave out the money as promised.[49] Mack supported a large 
extended family and was generous to players in need, often finding jobs 
for former players. For instance, he kept Bender on the team payroll as 
a scout, minor league manager or coach from 1926 until Mack himself retired 
as owner-manager in 1950. Simmons was a coach for many years after his 
retirement as a player. Mack lived through the entire era of racially segregated 
baseball (the early days of the game in his youth sometimes featured black 
players, but this ended by the 1890s and the major leagues remained white-only 
until Jackie Robinson broke down the color barrier in 1947), and even afterwards 
never displayed any serious interest in signing blacks. According to those 
who knew him, Mack was not a racist by the standards of his day and had 
no particular objection to a player's skin color.[citation needed] However, 
he did not want to cross the dictatorial commissioner Kenesaw Mountain 
Landis who represented the majority of MLB owners that opposed integrated 
baseball.[citation needed] I shall never forget Connie Mack's gentleness 
and gentility. The Philadelphia stadium, originally called Shibe Park, 
was renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953. Starting in 1909, it was home 
to the Athletics, and starting 1938, it was also home to the Phillies, 
then from 1955 to 1970 was home to the Phillies alone, after the Athletics 
moved to Kansas City. In addition to his Hall of Fame election in 1937, 
in 2008, Connie Mack was the first person inducted into the New York City–based 
Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame. He is mentioned in the poem Line-Up 
for Yesterday by Ogden Nash: Q is for Don Quixote Cornelius Mack; Neither 
Yankees nor years Can halt his attack. Mack's son Earle Mack played several 
games for the A's between 1910 and 1914, and also managed the team for 
parts of the 1937 and 1939 seasons when his father was too ill to do so. 
In more recent years, his descendants have taken to politics: Mack's grandson 
Connie Mack III was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 
Florida (1983–89) and the United States Senate (1989–2001); and great-grandson 
Connie Mack IV served in the U.S. House of Representatives (2005–13), representing 
Florida's 14th congressional district. On November 2, 1887, Mack married 
Margaret Hogan, whom the Spencer Leader described as having "a sunny and 
vivacious disposition." They had three children, Earle, Roy, and Marguerite. 
Margaret died in December 1892 after complications from her third childbirth. 
Mack married a second time on October 27, 1910. His second wife was Catherine 
(or Katharine) Holahan (or Hoolahan) (1879–1966); the census records have

couple had four daughters and a son, Cornelius Jr. A faithful Catholic 
his entire life, Mack was also a longtime member of the Knights of Columbus
