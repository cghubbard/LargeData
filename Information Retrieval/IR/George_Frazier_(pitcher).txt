George Allen Frazier (born October 13, 1954), is a former professional 
baseball player who pitched in the Major Leagues from 1978â€“1987, primarily 
as a set-up reliever. Frazier played high school baseball as a member of 
"the Hornets", which is the name of the teams at Hillcrest High School 
in Springfield, Missouri. Frazier was offered a college scholarship in 
baseball, football, and basketball. In 1981 while with the Yankees, Frazier 
tied a World Series record (with Lefty Williams) with 3 losses. Williams, 
however, is widely suspected to have thrown those games in the 1919 World 
Series (as part of the Black Sox Scandal), and furthermore, the third game 
Williams lost was Game Eight - the Series of 1919 through 1921 were best 
of nine affairs, leaving Frazier as the only pitcher to lose three games 
in a best of seven World Series. Frazier later appeared in the 1987 World 
Series as a member of the Twins. Frazier currently serves as a television 
commentator for the Colorado Rockies organization. His son, Parker Frazier 
was drafted in the eighth round of the 2007 MLB Draft by the Colorado Rockies.[citation
