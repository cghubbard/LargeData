Robert Groom (September 12, 1884 – February 19, 1948), was a professional 
baseball player who played as a pitcher in two midwest minor leagues and 
the Pacific Coast League from 1904 to 1908, and then in the Major Leagues 
from 1909 to 1918. He pitched for the Washington Senators (1909–1913), 
St. Louis Terriers (Federal League, 1914–1915), St. Louis Browns (1916–1917), 
and Cleveland Indians (1918). On May 6, 1917, while with the Browns, Groom 
no-hit the eventual World Champion Chicago White Sox 3–0. The no-hitter 
came in the second game of Sunday double-header, after Groom preserved 
the win in the first game, pitching the last two innings without allowing 
a hit. It also came the day after teammate Ernie Koob's 1–0 no-hitter against 
the White Sox; to date, Koob and Groom are the only teammates to pitch 
no-hitters on consecutive days. His best major league season was with the 
1912 Senators, when he won 24 games and Washington finished second in the 
American League. During his debut season, Groom became the first pitcher 
to achieve 19 consecutive losses in a season, a record which was equalled 
in 1916 by Jack Nabors.[1] After the 1918 season, Bob Groom returned to 
Belleville, where he managed his family's coal mining operation and, in 
the summers, pitched for and managed local teams into the 1920s, most notably 
Belleville's White Rose team. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s he was involved 
with the St. Louis Trolley League as a mentor, and in 1938, he was asked 
by the George E. Hilgard American Legion Post 58 to form Belleville's first 
tournament team. He did and coached them to the state and regional championships 
in their first season. He led the "Hilgards" through 1944, and for his 
role in founding the team was inducted into the Hilgard Hall of Fame in 
February 2008. A marker in his honor, part of a series that grew out of 
the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) Deadball Stars books, 
was presented on June 5, 2008, at the Belleville Hilgards' home ballpark,
