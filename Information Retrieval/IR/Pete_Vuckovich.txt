Peter Dennis Vuckovich (vook-koh-vich) (born October 27, 1952 in Johnstown, 
Pennsylvania) is a retired American starting pitcher in Major League Baseball 
who came across as an intimidating presence on the mound with his 6'4" 
(1.93 m) 220 lb (100 kg) frame and Fu Manchu moustache. Vuckovich was drafted 
by the Chicago White Sox in 1974. He batted and threw right-handed. Vuckovich 
graduated from Conemaugh Valley High School and went on to Clarion University 
to play baseball. Nearly thirty years, to the day, after the White Sox 
drafted Vuckovich they drafted his son, Peter Vuckovich, Jr., who also 
attended both Conemaugh Valley High School and Clarion University, in the 
48th round of the 2004 amateur draft. Vuckovich is a member of the Clarion 
University Sports Hall of Fame. Vuckovich is also a member of both the 
Western PA Sports Hall of Fame and the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame. 
Vuckovich is of Serbian background. Vuckovich developed a reputation for 
bizarre, hyper-competitive behavior during his twelve season career. He 
would fidget, twitch, pace, and convulse while on the mound. He was known 
to cross his eyes and stick his tongue out at batters. He would spit in 
his glove, scream at umpires while in the stretch, and sometimes step to 
the back of the mound and dry heave. His colorful personality made him 
a fan favorite.[citation needed] After minimal duty with Chicago from 1975–76, 
Vuckovich was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1976 MLB expansion 
draft. Even though the young Blue Jays lost 107 games in 1977, and although 
mostly used in relief, Vuckovich managed a 7-7 record with eight saves. 
He recorded the first shutout in Toronto franchise history, a 2-0 victory 
over Jim Palmer and the Orioles. He also recorded the first save in Toronto 
franchise history on April 7, 1977 versus the Chicago White Sox. Involved 
in a multi-player trade to the St. Louis Cardinals, Vuckovich's career 
went to the next level. By 1978, he started more often, winning 39 games 
for the Cardinals during three years. He finished third in the National 
League in ERA with a 2.55 mark in 1978, and ranked fourth in shutouts (3) 
in 1980. A part of a seven-player trade in December 1980, Vuckovich went 
to the Milwaukee Brewers along with Rollie Fingers and Ted Simmons. With 
the Brewers, Vuckovich continued his stellar pitching. He led the American 
League in wins (14) and winning percentage Win-Loss % (.778) during the 
strike-shortened 1981 season. When Milwaukee won the AL pennant in 1982, 
Vuckovich won the Cy Young Award with an 18-6 record and a 3.34 ERA, and 
once again tied for the league lead with the Baltimore Orioles' Jim Palmer 
in winning percentage Win-Loss % (.750) He lost Game Two of the ALCS to 
the Angels 4-2, and started the decisive fifth game, though not figuring 
in the decision. In the 1982 World Series, the Cardinals beat him 6-2 in 
Game Three, and he got a no-decision in the final loss. This was, however, 
to prove the zenith of his career, as Vuckovich had been battling shoulder 
pain for two seasons, and in spring training of 1983, it was discovered 
that he had torn his rotator cuff. Vuckovich skipped surgery in favor of 
an exercise rehabilitation. He attempted an unsuccessful comeback for three 
games and went 0-2 in 14 innings, then missed all of 1984. Subsequent and 
prolonged comeback attempts all failed, and by the end of the 1986 season, 
Milwaukee released Vuckovich. In an eleven season career, Vuckovich posted 
a 93-69 record with 882 strikeouts and a 3.66 ERA in 1455.1 innings pitched. 
In postseason play, he was 1-2 with a 3.74 ERA. Following his retirement, 
Vuckovich worked for three years (1989 to 1991) as a television announcer 
for the Milwaukee Brewers. Vuckovich portrayed fictional Yankees slugger 
Clu Haywood in the film Major League.[1] In 1992, he was hired by the Pittsburgh 
Pirates as a pitching instructor. Vuckovich served as the pitching coach 
for the Pittsburgh Pirates for the 1997–2000 seasons. He then worked his 
way through the Pirates organization to the position of special assistant 
to the general manager with the Pirates, and held a similar post with the 
Seattle Mariners' organization under Jack Zduriencik, Seattle's GM from 
2009–15.[2] In 2016, Vuckovich is serving as a professional scout for the
