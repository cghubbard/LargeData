The 1931 New York Yankees season was the team's 29th season in New York 
and its 31st season overall. The team finished with a record of 94â€“59, 
finishing 13.5 games behind the Philadelphia Athletics. New York was managed 
by Joe McCarthy. The Yankees played their home games at Yankee Stadium. 
This team is notable for holding the modern day Major League record for 
team runs scored in a season with 1,067 (6.88 per game average). First 
baseman Lou Gehrig set an American League record by driving in 184 runs,[3] 
breaking his own record of 175 set in 1927. The total, which was seven 
short of Hack Wilson's all-time record of 191 set the previous year, still 
stands as of the end of the 2015 season. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]
