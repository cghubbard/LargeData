Pigtown was the previous name of a neighborhood in the New York City borough 
of Brooklyn, until approximately the beginning of the 20th century. The 
community got its name because it was the location of several major pig 
farms that supplied Brooklyn.[1] Pigtown was at the southern periphery 
of the City of Brooklyn where it bordered the Town of Flatbush. On modern 
maps it is bounded on the north by Empire Boulevard (formerly Malbone Street), 
on the south by Midwood Street, on the east by Albany Avenue and on the 
west by Nostrand Avenue, in the southernmost portion of Crown Heights, 
and on the edge of East Flatbush.[1] Pigtown was the site of Ebbets Field, 
the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1912 to 1957. Future drag racer Frederick 
DiNome and his criminal brother Richard DiNome were born and raised in 
Pigtown. The neighborhood is now called Wingate. Coordinates: 40°40′N 73°57′W﻿
