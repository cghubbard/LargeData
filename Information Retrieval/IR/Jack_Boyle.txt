John Anthony Boyle (March 22, 1866 â€“ January 7, 1913), nicknamed "Honest 
Jack", was an American catcher and first baseman in Major League Baseball. 
His younger brother, Eddie Boyle, played in 1896.[1] Born in Cincinnati,[2] 
Boyle began his professional baseball career in 1886, playing in one game 
for the Cincinnati Red Stockings of the American Association. On November 
12, 1886, he was traded (along with $350) to the St. Louis Browns in exchange 
for Hugh Nicol.[3] Jack caught only a couple of games until July 3.[citation

opportunity.[citation needed] He caught 87 straight games[4] for the Browns 
using the old finger glove which preceded the protective mitt of the modern 
era.[citation needed] Boyle accompanied Charles Comiskey to the Chicago 
Pirates of the Players' League team in 1890, but returned with him to St. 
Louis the following year.[4] In 1892 Jack signed with the New York Giants 
for a sum of $5,500.[citation needed] This was the largest salary ever 
paid to a major leaguer at this time.[citation needed] After one season 
with New York, he was traded (with Jack Sharrott and cash) on March 11, 
1893, to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for Roger Connor.[3] There 
followed five years as a catcher for the Philadelphia club. On July 9, 
1898, he was sold by Philadelphia to the Giants for $1000.[3] However, 
he did not play a single game for them and was returned to Philadelphia 
on August 15, 1898.[3] He also served as an umpire in the National League 
(4 games) and American Association (1 game) between 1888 and 1897.[3] He 
opened a saloon[4] in the Ohio River city on Seventh Street[citation needed] 
which grew into a successful business for him.[citation needed] Boyle was 
46 years of age when he died of Bright's Disease[citation needed] at his 
home[4] on Academy Avenue, Price Hill[citation needed] in Cincinnati. He
