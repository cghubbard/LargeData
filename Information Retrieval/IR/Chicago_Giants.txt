The Chicago Giants were a professional baseball team based in Chicago, 
Illinois which played in the Negro leagues. The team was founded by Frank 
Leland after he and his partner, Rube Foster, split up the Leland Giants 
in 1910. Frank Leland's new club was sometimes also known as Leland's Chicago 
Giants, until a court injunction forced Frank Leland to stop using the 
name Leland Giants.[1] A 1910 article about an upcoming game and parade, 
announced everyone would wear the team colors, "white and maroon."[2] After 
Leland's death, November 14, 1914,[3] the team came under the control of 
longtime player Charles "Joe" Green. In 1920, the Chicago Giants became 
a founding member of the Negro National League (NNL). They played as a 
travelling team, without a home field, and finished in last place in both 
1920 and 1921. Their best player was a young catcher/shortstop named John 
Beckwith, who was purchased by Rube Foster for his Chicago American Giants
