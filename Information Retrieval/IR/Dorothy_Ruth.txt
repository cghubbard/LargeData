Dorothy Helen Ruth Pirone (June 7, 1921 – May 18, 1989) was the biological 
daughter of Babe Ruth and his mistress Juanita Jennings (born Juanita Grenandtz).[1] 
She was adopted by Babe and his first wife, Helen Woodward Ruth. She wrote 
a memoir of her father, titled My Dad, the Babe. Dorothy was born June 
7, 1921 in New York City, at St. Vincent's Hospital to Juanita Jennings, 
and was adopted by Babe and Helen Ruth. It is documented that Dorothy was 
raised to believe that Helen was her biological mother. It is speculated 
that Helen did not know that Dorothy was the result of an extramarital 
affair between Babe and his girlfriend, Jennings. It is possible that when 
Babe Ruth learned of his mistress's pregnancy, he convinced Helen, unaware 
that Babe was the father, to adopt the baby girl. Babe Ruth also somehow 
convinced Dorothy's biological mother to allow him to adopt their daughter, 
so that she could be raised with him and a (possibly unsuspecting) Helen. 
Helen and Babe Ruth separated some time between 1924–1926. Babe and Helen 
Ruth did not divorce because of their religious beliefs. Dorothy lived 
with her adoptive mother Helen after the separation. In January 1929, when 
she was 7 years old, her mother died in a house fire. After Helen's death, 
Dorothy lived with her father and Claire Merritt Ruth, whom he married 
in April 1929. She had one step-sister, as Babe had adopted Claire's daughter 
Julia. Dorothy learned at the age of 59 in 1980 that Juanita Jennings Ellias 
was her real mother. Dorothy had known Juanita growing up, but only as 
a friend of her father. She had never known that Jennings was her biological 
mother.[2] She referred to Jennings as "Aunt Nita." [3] She married Daniel 
J. Sullivan, a Brooklyn employee of the Railway Express Agency, on January 
7, 1940. Her son, Daniel J. Sullivan Jr. (1940 - 1974), was born in October 
1940 and later had 5 children. Dorothy's marriage to Sullivan also produced 
two daughters, Genevieve Herrlein and Ellen Ruth Hourigan (b. 1943), before 
the union ended in 1945. Dorothy later married Dominick Pirone, a New York 
general contractor in New York City, on December 8, 1948. Three children 
were born of this second marriage: Donna Analovitch, Richard Pirone (1950-2001), 
and Linda Ruth Tosetti (b. 1954). She lived in Durham, Connecticut and 
raised Arabian horses,[1] and wrote My Dad, the Babe.[4][5] She was a joint 
plaintiff along with the Babe Ruth League in a trademark dispute with Macmillan 
Incorporated over use of the Babe Ruth likeness.[6] She died on May 18, 
1989 at the age of 67 in Durham, Connecticut, survived by four daughters,
