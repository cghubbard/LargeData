John Henry "Heinie" Sand (July 3, 1897 â€“ November 3, 1958) was an American 
shortstop in Major League Baseball who played from 1923 to 1928 with the 
Philadelphia Phillies. He debuted on April 17, 1923 and played his final 
game on September 30, 1928. In 1925, he had a .364 on-base percentage and 
55 runs batted in and was 18th in the voting for the National League's 
Most Valuable Player Award. Over six season, he played in 848 games, including 
772 at shortstop. For his career, he hit for a .258 average with a .343 
on-base percentage. Born in San Francisco, California, Sand got his start 
playing for the Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast League from 1918 
to 1922.[1] Sand had an unassisted triple play while playing for Salt Lake 
City.[2] Sand is best known for his role in a 1924 bribery incident that 
resulted in two players being banned from baseball by Commissioner Kenesaw 
Mountain Landis. Sand knew New York Giants player Jimmy O'Connell from 
their days in San Francisco. On September 23, the Phillies were out of 
contention, and O'Connell offered to pay $500 to Sand if he would "go easy" 
on the Giants. The incident came to the attention of Judge Landis, who 
conducted a hearing. O'Connell admitted making the offer and implicated 
Giants coach Cozy Dolan in the scheme. Landis banned both O'Connell and 
Dolan from baseball.[3][4][5] Sand was involved as a shortstop in three 
triple plays in his career. In July 1924, Sand was involved in a triple 
play on a ball hit by Heinie Groh. In 1929, Sand was acquired by the Rochester 
Red Wings of the International League.[1][6] After playing one year in 
Rochester, Sand was sold to the Baltimore Orioles in November 1929.[7] 
Sand played for the Orioles for four years from 1930 to 1933.[1] He finished 
his career in 1934 playing for San Francisco's Mission Reds in the Pacific 
Coast League. The statistic that stands out above all others with Sand 
was his propensity to strike out. He was among the top 10 batters in strikeouts 
in all six of his major league seasons, striking out 56 times in his rookie 
season in 1923 (5th highest in the National League (NL)), 57 in 1924 (3rd 
highest in the NL), 65 in 1925 (2nd highest in the NL), 56 in 1926 (6th 
highest in the NL), 59 in 1927 (3rd highest in the NL), and 49 in his final 
season in 1928 (9th highest in the NL). Sand was also a leader in bases 
on balls, walking 82 times in 1923 (2nd in the NL), 52 times in 1924 (10th 
in the NL), 64 times in 1925 (6th in the NL), and 66 times in 1926 (2nd 
in the NL). Sand also was third in runs scored in the National League in 
1926, with 99. Sand belongs to that small group of players who always had 
at least 120 games and 400+ at bats in every major league season played. 
After retiring from baseball, Sand became involved in the plumbing business. 
He was a member of one of the oldest plumbing contracting companies in 
San Francisco.[8] In November 1958, Sand died at age 61 at St. Mary's Hospital
