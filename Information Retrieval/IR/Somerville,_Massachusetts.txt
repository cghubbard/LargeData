Somerville /ˈsʌmərvɪl/ is a city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United 
States, located two miles northwest of Boston. As of 2010[update], the 
United States Census has the city with a total population of 75,754 people, 
and is the most densely populated municipality in New England. As of 2010[update], 
it was the 16th most densely populated incorporated municipality in the 
country. Somerville was established as a town in 1842, when it was separated 
from Charlestown. In 2006, the town was named the best-run city in Massachusetts 
by the Boston Globe.[1] In 1972, in 2009, and again in 2015, the city received 
the All-America City Award.[2][3] The territory now comprising the city 
of Somerville was first settled in 1629 as part of Charlestown. In 1629, 
English surveyor Thomas Graves led a scouting party of 100 Puritans from 
the settlement of Salem to prepare the site for the Great Migration of 
Puritans from England. Graves was attracted to the narrow Mishawum Peninsula 
between the Charles River and the Mystic River, linked to the mainland 
at the present-day Sullivan Square. The area of earliest settlement was 
based at City Square on the peninsula, though the territory of Charlestown 
officially included all of what is now Somerville, as well as Melrose, 
Malden,[4] Stoneham,[5] Medford, Everett, Woburn, Burlington, and parts 
of Arlington and Cambridge.[6] From that time until 1842, the area of present-day 
Somerville was referred to as "beyond the Neck" in reference to the thin 
spit of land, the Charlestown Neck, that connected it to the Charlestown 
Peninsula.[7] The first European settler in Somerville of whom there is 
any record was John Woolrich, an Indian trader who came from the Charlestown 
Peninsula in 1630, and settled near Dane Street. Others soon followed Woolrich, 
locating in the vicinity of present-day Union Square. The population continued 
to slowly increase, and by 1775 there were about 500 inhabitants scattered 
across the area. Otherwise, the area was mostly used as grazing and farmland. 
It was once known as the "Stinted Pasture" or "Cow Commons", as early settlers 
of Charlestown had the right to pasture a certain number of cows in the 
area. John Winthrop, the first colonial governor of the Massachusetts Bay 
Colony, was granted 600 acres (2.4 km2) of land in the area in 1631. Named 
for the ten small knolls located on the property, Ten Hills Farm extended 
from the Craddock Bridge in present-day Medford Center to Convent Hill 
in East Somerville. Winthrop lived, planted, and raised cattle on the farm. 
It is also where he launched the first ship in Massachusetts, the "Blessing 
of the Bay." Built for trading purposes in the early 1630s, it was soon 
armed for use as a patrol boat for the New England coast. It is seen as 
a precursor to the United States Navy.[8][9] The neighborhood Ten Hills, 
located in the northeastern part of the city, has retained the name for 
over 300 years. New research has found that less than a decade after John 
Winthrop moved to the farm in 1631, there were enslaved Native American 
prisoners of war on the property. Each successive owner of Ten Hills Farm 
would depend upon slavery's profits until the 1780s, when Massachusetts 
abolished the practice.[10] In a short time, the settlers began laying 
out roads in all directions in search of more land for planting and trade 
with various Native American tribes in the area. Laid out as early as the 
mid-1630s, the earliest highway in Somerville was probably what is now 
Washington Street, and led from present-day Sullivan Square to Harvard 
Square. In its earliest days, Washington Street was known as the "Road 
to Newtowne" (renamed Cambridge in 1638). During the 1700s and early 1800s, 
Washington Street, together with Somerville Avenue, comprised "Milk Row," 
a route favored by Middlesex County dairy farmers as the best way to get 
to the markets of Charlestown and Boston. Laid out in 1636, Broadway was 
likely the second highway built in the area. Originally called "Menotomie's 
Road," it ran from the Charlestown Neck to the settlement at Menotomy (present-day 
Arlington). Initially bordered by farmsteads, Broadway would come into 
its own as a commercial thoroughfare after horse-drawn trolleys were introduced 
to the highway in 1858.[11] Somerville was home to one of the first hostile 
acts of the American Revolutionary War. The theft of colonial gunpowder 
by British soldiers, and the massive popular reaction that ensued, are 
considered to be a turning point in the events leading up to war.[12] First 
built by settlers for use as a windmill in the early 1700s, the Old Powder 
House was sold to the colonial government of Massachusetts for use as a 
gunpowder magazine in 1747. Located at the intersection of Broadway and 
College Avenue in present-day Powder House Square, the Old Powder House 
held the largest supply of gunpowder in all of Massachusetts. General Thomas 
Gage, who had become the military governor of Massachusetts in May 1774, 
was charged with enforcement of the highly unpopular Intolerable Acts, 
which British Parliament had passed in response to the Boston Tea Party. 
Seeking to prevent the outbreak of war, he believed that the best way to 
accomplish this was by secretly removing military stores from storehouses 
and arsenals in New England.[13] Just after dawn on September 1, 1774, 
a force of roughly 260 British regulars from the 4th Regiment, under the 
command of Lieutenant Colonel George Maddison, were rowed in secrecy up 
the Mystic River from Boston to a landing point near Winter Hill. From 
there they marched about a mile to the Powder House, and after sunrise 
removed all of the gunpowder. Most of the regulars then returned to Boston 
the way they had come, but a small contingent marched on to Cambridge, 
seizing two field pieces from the Cambridge Common.[14] The field pieces 
and powder were then taken from Boston to the British stronghold on Castle 
Island, then known as Castle William (renamed Fort Independence in 1779).[15] 
In response to the raid, amid rumors that blood had been shed, alarm spread 
through the countryside as far as Connecticut and beyond, and American 
Patriots sprang into action, fearing that war was at hand. Thousands of 
militiamen began streaming toward Boston and Cambridge, and mob action 
forced Loyalists and some government officials to flee to the protection 
of the British Army. This action provided a "dress rehearsal" for the Battles 
of Lexington and Concord seven months later in the famous "shot heard 'round 
the world", and inflamed already heated feelings on both sides, spurring 
actions by both British and American forces to remove powder and cannon 
to secure locations.[citation needed] After the raid on the Powder House, 
the colonists took action to conceal arms and munitions of war in Concord. 
When General Gage found out, he was resolved to take the powder by force 
if necessary. The Americans learned that the British intended to start 
for Concord on April 18, 1775, and veteran courier Paul Revere set out 
on his famous ride to warn the farmers and militiamen in between Boston 
and Concord, including Sam Adams and John Hancock. That night he set out 
from the North End through Charlestown towards East Somerville, where he 
encountered two British officers stationed on Washington Street. They immediately 
pursued him, and Revere galloped up Broadway towards Winter Hill and eventually 
eluded them. His warning gave the militia enough time to prepare for battle, 
and launch the American Revolution.[16] Shortly after Paul Revere set out 
on his ride, Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith and 700 British Army regulars 
landed near Lechmere Square. As it was nearly high tide, East Cambridge 
was an island and the troops, skirting the marshes, were obliged to wade 
"thigh deep" to reach Somerville. They probably came through Prospect Street 
into Washington Street, and through Union Square.[17] Defeated and in retreat, 
the British army passed again through Somerville en route back to Boston. 
Upon reaching Union Square, the British marched down Washington Street 
as far as the base of Prospect Hill, where a skirmish took place. The handful 
of rebellious locals, having heard of the storied battles at Lexington 
and Concord earlier that day, caught an exhausted retreating British contingent 
off guard. As the story goes, 65-year-old minuteman James Miller lost his 
life in the scuffle while standing his ground against the British. He was 
shot thirteen times after famously telling a retreating colleague, "I am 
too old to run."[18] Somerville occupied a conspicuous position during 
the entire Siege of Boston, which lasted nine months, and Prospect Hill 
became the central position of the Continental Army's chain of emplacements 
north of Boston. Its height and commanding view of Boston and the harbor 
had tremendous strategic value and the fortress became known as the "Citadel". 
Originally occupied by just 400 men, Prospect Hill became a primary encampment 
for American forces after General Israel Putnam's retreat from the Battle 
of Bunker Hill. On January 1, 1776, the Grand Union Flag flew for the first 
time at the Citadel, the first official raising of an American flag.[citation 
needed] With the Revolutionary War over, the residents of Somerville were 
able once again to devote their energies wholeheartedly to the business 
of making a living. From the 1780s until Somerville's separation from Charlestown 
in 1842, material progress was continuous, if a bit slow. As transportation 
infrastructure gradually transformed the area, new industries sprang up, 
such as brickmaking, quarrying and dairy farming. Transportation improvements 
in the early to mid-1800s factored significantly in the growth of a more 
urban residential form and Somerville's incorporation as a City in 1872. 
These improvements included the opening of the Middlesex Canal through 
Somerville in 1803,[19] various turnpikes such as Medford and Beacon streets, 
built during the 1810s and 1820s, and especially the introduction of rail 
lines. In 1841, the Fitchburg Railroad was built between Boston and Fresh 
Pond in Cambridge, paralleling the route of Somerville Avenue. This led 
to the establishment of industries along its path. Soon after, in 1843 
the Fitchburg Railroad commenced passenger service and enabled residential 
development along the southern slopes of Prospect and Spring hills. By 
the early 1840s, the population of present-day Somerville topped 1,000 
for the first time.[20] Despite the growth, however, discontent was growing 
steadily outside the "neck." The area's rural farmers paid taxes to the 
local government in Charlestown, but received little in return. By 1842, 
the area had no churches, few schools, no taverns, and suffered from poor 
and impassable roads. For many years after the Revolution the two parts 
of Charlestown styled "within" and "without the neck" were nearly equal 
in population; the former had by this time completely outstripped the latter. 
With this growth of population and trade came the need of city institutions, 
and consequently greater expenses were involved. Therefore, the rural part 
of Charlestown found herself contributing to the paving of the streets, 
the maintenance of a night watch, to the building of engine houses, and 
various other improvements from which they derived little benefit. In 1828, 
a petition was presented to the Legislature asking that a part of Charlestown 
be set off as a separate town, to be known as Warren. This petition was 
subsequently withdrawn. The desire for a separate township continued to 
spread, and by 1841, becoming impatient at the neglect of the government 
to adequately provide for their needs, the inhabitants again agitated a 
division of the town, and a meeting in reference to the matter was held 
November 22 in the Prospect Hill school house.[21] A petition was accordingly 
drawn up and signed by Guy C. Hawkins and 151 others, and a committee deputed 
to further its passage through the Legislature, then in session. A bill 
incorporating a new town was signed by the governor on March 3, 1842. The 
original choice for the city's new name, after breaking away from Charlestown, 
was Walford, after the first settler of Charlestown, Thomas Walford. However, 
this name was not adopted by the separation committee. Charles Miller, 
a member of this committee, proposed the name "Somerville", which was ultimately 
chosen. It was not derived from any one person's name, and a report commissioned 
by the Somerville Historical Society found that Somerville was a "purely 
fanciful name".[18] Before Somerville became a township in 1842 the area 
was primarily populated by British farmers and brick makers who sold their 
wares in the markets of Boston, Cambridge and Charlestown. As the markets 
grew, the population of Somerville increased six-fold between the years 
of 1842 and 1870 to 14,685. With the sharp influx of immigrants to the 
Somerville area, industry boomed and brick manufacturing became the predominant 
trade. Before mechanical presses were invented, Somerville produced 1.3 
million bricks a year. Thereafter, production increased rapidly to 5.5 
million bricks a year, and the success of the brickyards began to attract 
numerous other industries. In 1851, American Tubes Works opened, followed 
by meat processing and packaging plants. Other Somerville factories came 
to produce steam engines, boilers, household appliances, glass, and iron. 
Shortly thereafter Somerville incorporated as a city in 1872. The population 
growth was due in part to improvements in pre-existing transportation lines,[which?] 
as well as a new rail line, the Lexington and Arlington Railroad, introduced 
through Davis Square in 1870. At its height, Somerville was served by eight 
passenger rail stations. Somerville's buoyant economy during this period 
was tied to industries that tended to locate at the periphery of the residential 
core, near freight rail corridors. By the mid 1870s meat packing plants 
were the primary employers and profit centers of the community.[22] The 
Late Industrial Period (1870-1915) was a time of phenomenal growth for 
Somerville in all spheres including civic and commercial ventures. Infrastructure 
such as rail, water lines, telegraph and electricity were established and 
connected to surrounding towns. The population exploded from 15,000 to 
90,000. While brickmaking had taken a hold in the area after the railroads 
first arrived in the 1830s, Somerville's brickyards boomed through 1870. 
Meatpacking soon displaced brickmaking as the primary industry in the city, 
dubbed "The Chicago of New England." Additionally, Somerville's location 
adjacent to Boston and proximity to rail and road transportation made it 
an ideal location for distribution facilities. Between 1915 and 1930 population 
growth slowed slightly as Somerville's industries consolidated rather than 
expanded, and the period's most important enterprises were meat packing, 
dairy processing, ice and food distribution. Construction of the McGrath 
Highway in 1925 marked the turning point of Somerville as an industrial 
city, which accelerated when the Ford Motor Company built a plant in Assembly 
Square in 1926. In the years that followed, Somerville would see itself 
transformed into a major industrial center as automobile assembly surpassed 
meat packing as Somerville's most important industry.[23] Although Union 
Square and Davis Square continued to be the largest commercial areas during 
the first decades of the 20th century, smaller, less-developed squares 
grew as well. Ball Square, Magoun Square and Teele Square were developed 
with one- or two-story masonry commercial buildings. Retail development 
and banking facilities also spread. During this time of industrial prosperity, 
continuing through World War II, the city of Somerville reached its population 
apex at 105,883 residents in 1940. The building boom continued until the 
1940s, creating the dense residential fabric the "city of homes" is known 
for.[24] By mid-century, powerful social and economic forces precipitated 
a period of industrial and population decline that lasted into the 1980s. 
The postwar period was characterized by the ascent of the private automobile, 
which carried significant implications for Somerville. Streetcar lines 
that had crisscrossed the city since 1890 were systematically ripped out 
and commuter rail service was discontinued at the city's eight railway 
stations, one by one. Passenger rail service along the Fitchburg and Lowell 
lines had been declining for some time, and stations such as Gilman Square 
were removed as early as the late 1940s. Passenger rail service stopped 
altogether by 1958. The number of cars on Somerville's streets continued 
to rise, and road construction projects proliferated. The Alewife Brook 
Parkway, Mystic Valley Parkway and the Fells Connector Parkways, originally 
conceived in the 1890s as a means for city residents to reach the metropolitan 
parks, evolved into congested commuter routes for suburban drivers. Highway 
projects were advanced in the wake of the Federal Highway Aid Act (1956), 
in some instances displacing entire neighborhoods. The Brickbottom neighborhood 
was razed in 1950 to prepare for a proposed Inner Belt Expressway, and 
construction of Interstate 93 resulted in demolition of homes in The States 
neighborhood during the late 1960s.[25] Industry slowly moved outward to 
the metropolitan fringes, encouraged by highway access and cheap, undeveloped 
land. The Ford Motor Plant in Assembly Square, which had been one of the 
region's largest employers, closed its doors in 1958 with severe consequences 
for the local economy. From the late 1950s through the early 1970s, Finast 
Supermarkets used the building that had earlier housed the Ford assembly 
plant on Middlesex Avenue, but in 1976 it too closed its doors. By 1976, 
Assembly Square was becoming a ghost town: Finast Stores, the Boston and 
Maine Railroad, and Ford Motor Company, which had each paid the city over 
$1 million in annual taxes, were gone. By the late 1970s, Somerville was 
losing population, revenue and jobs.[26] In the last years of the 20th 
century, the situation in Somerville stabilized and growth returned—first 
to West Somerville, and then the rest of the city. Almost thirty years 
after passenger rail service to Somerville was halted, the Red Line Northwest 
Extension reached Davis Square in 1984. The city and community used the 
creation of the new station as a catalyst for revitalizing the faded square, 
promoting new commercial development and sponsoring other physical and 
infrastructural improvements. However, when the new transit station opened, 
business around Davis Square did not immediately thrive. The number of 
retail stores in the area declined from 68 in 1977 to 56 in 1987. However 
many non-retail uses, such as beauty salons and real estate offices, had 
already begun to fill the empty retail spaces. With the Boston area's emergence 
from its long recession, the area truly began to revive. Clearly, the community's 
vision of a rebirth of commercial and retail activity has, in the past 
few years, been fully realized. All benefit from their proximity to the 
MBTA station, as retail vacancy rates around the square are close to zero.[27] 
The telecommunication and biotechnology booms of the mid-to-late 1990s 
significantly contributed to Somerville's revitalization. As with the housing 
boom a century earlier, the sudden increase in the number of jobs available 
in the cities of Somerville, Boston, and particularly Cambridge – as well 
in as the other communities immediately surrounding Somerville – led to 
a new surge in the demand for housing.[28] Additionally, the end of rent 
control in Cambridge coincided with the economic recovery in 1995, increasing 
demand for Somerville's affordable housing options.[29] Until the 1990s, 
Somerville was known for its blue-collar residents and its reputation for 
crime, especially in the city's east, where the Winter Hill Gang was based. 
The city also had a very high car theft rate, once being the car theft 
capital of the country, and its Assembly Square area was especially infamous 
for this.[30] However, after the gentrification period the city went through 
in the 1990s, and an influx of artists to the area, this name has mostly 
faded from use and the city has instead gained a reputation for its active 
arts community and effective government, including being named the best-run 
city in Massachusetts in 2006.[31] Nowadays lobbying by grassroots organizations 
is attempting to revive and preserve Somerville's "small town" neighborhood 
environments by supporting local business, public transit and gardens. 
According to the United States Census Bureau, Somerville has a total area 
of 4.2 square miles (11 km2), of which 4.1 square miles (11 km2) is land 
and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) (2.61%) is water.[32] Somerville is bordered 
by the cities of Cambridge, Arlington, Medford, Everett, and the Boston 
neighborhood of Charlestown. It is located on the west bank of the Mystic 
River. Millennia ago, glaciation left a series of drumlins running west 
to east across the landscape of what would become Somerville. These ridges 
would later become known as the "Seven Hills" of Somerville:[33] These 
hills rise from the floodplain of the Mystic River, and generally run west 
to east, providing for beautiful vistas of Boston to the south and Medford/Everett 
to the north. Physical boundaries are also defined by prominent waterways: 
the Mystic River to the north, its tributary Alewife Brook to the west, 
and the Miller's River to the southeast. Land in early Somerville was used 
primarily as grazing commons and small farms. After the proliferation of 
the railroads in the area during the mid-1800s, industrialization transformed 
the landscape. In the 1800s, the Millers River was used as a sewer and 
dumping ground for local industry and would be ordered filled by the Commonwealth 
before the end of the century due to health reasons. As a result of significant 
land movement and the elimination of former Cobble Hill, this low floodplain, 
the Millers River marsh, was turned into railyards, slaughterhouses and 
other large-scale land uses.[34] Somerville's commercial property is not 
concentrated in a recognized downtown central business district but instead 
is spread over many different nodes or corridors of business activity. 
The difference in character ranges from the vibrant nightlife, live music 
and theaters of Davis Square to the large scale retail and highway access 
of Assembly Square. This spatial allocation is directly related to the 
early influence of rail and streetcar systems which caused economic activity 
to occur at stops. The other key factor in the creation of commercial squares 
is the area's topography. The numerous hills making up Somerville's landscape 
determined where road networks would allow neighborhood commercial development.[35] 
Somerville has a number of squares that are centers for business and entertainment, 
as well as a number of other neighborhoods:[36][37] Sullivan Square, in 
the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston, is just over the border from East 
Somerville; Inman Square and Lechmere Square, both in Cambridge, are also 
just outside Somerville. Porter Square is in both Somerville and Cambridge. 
Somerville has a humid continental climate with warm summers, cold winters 
and high humidity year-round. The hottest month is July, with a mean temperature 
of 74.0 °F (23.3 °C). The coldest month is January, with a mean of 29.0 °F 
(−1.7 °C). More inland than Boston, conditions in Somerville are less likely 
to be moderated by the Atlantic Ocean, and temperatures are typically a 
few degrees warmer or colder than Boston depending on the season. Somerville 
is the 21st windiest city in the United States, with an average wind speed 
of 12.4 mph.[41] Somerville has experienced dramatic gentrification since 
the Red Line of Boston's MBTA subway system was extended through Somerville 
in 1985, especially in the area between Harvard and Tufts. This was especially 
accelerated by the repeal of rent control in the mid-1990s followed directly 
by the dot-com bubble of the late 90s. Residential property values approximately 
quadrupled from 1991 to 2003, and the stock of rental housing decreased 
as lucrative condominium conversions become commonplace.[citation needed] 
Gentrification has led to tensions between long-time residents and recent 
arrivals, with many of the former accusing the latter of ignoring problems 
of working-class families such as drugs and gang violence. Incidents such 
as anti-"yuppie" graffiti, appearing around town in 2005, have highlighted 
this rift. The economic clash between several areas of the city of Somerville 
and its neighboring cities of Boston, and in particular Cambridge, has 
created a culture of anti-intellectualism and anti-gentry sentiment that 
has spanned many generations.[54][non-primary source needed] Symptoms of 
this include petty crime, and in some cases, violence against outsiders.[55] 
Due to Somerville's close proximity to various institutions of higher education, 
the city has a constant influx of college students and young professionals, 
who reside in sections near Cambridge where Harvard University, Lesley 
University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are located and 
near Tufts University, which straddles the Somerville-Medford city line. 
The city is inhabited by blue collar Irish American, Italian American, 
and to a slightly lesser extent Portuguese American families, who are spread 
throughout the city. Immigrant families from Brazil, Haiti and El Salvador 
live primarily in East Somerville, while those from South Korea, Nepal, 
and India, tend to reside in the Union Square area.[citation needed]. In 
November 1997, the Utne Reader named Davis Square in Somerville one of 
the 15 hippest places to live in the U.S.[56] Somerville is home to a thriving 
arts community and boasts the second highest number of artists per capita 
in America.[57] As of the 2010 census, there were 75,754 people, 33,720 
households, and 14,673 families residing in the city. The population density 
was 18,404.8 people per square mile (7,278.4/km²). There were 32,105 housing 
units at an average density of 7,909.1 per square mile (3,051.0/km²). The 
racial makeup of the city was 69.1% White, 6.8% African American, 0.3% 
Native American, 8.7% Asian (2.7% Chinese, 2.3% Indian, 1.0% Nepalese, 
0.6% Korean), 0.06% Pacific Islander, 4.96% from other races, and 3.6% 
were multiracial. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 10.6% of the population 
(4.2% Salvadoran, 1.2% Puerto Rican, 1.0% Mexican, 0.5% Guatemalan[58]). 
There were 31,555 households out of which 18.8% had children under the 
age of 18 living with them, 32.2% were married couples living together, 
10.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 53.5% were 
non-families. 31% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.8% 
had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average 
household size was 2.38 and the average family size was 3.06. The population 
was spread out with 14.8% under the age of 18, 15.9% from 18 to 24, 42.6% 
from 25 to 44, 16.2% from 45 to 64, and 10.5% who were 65 years of age 
or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females, there were 
94.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.2 males. 
The median income for a household in the city was $46,315, and the median 
income for a family was $51,243. Males had a median income of $36,333 versus 
$31,418 for females. The per capita income for the city was $23,628. About 
8.4% of families and 12.5% of the population were below the poverty line, 
including 14.3% of those under age 18 and 13.6% of those age 65 or over. 
According to Somerville's 2013 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the 
top employers in the city are:[59] Somerville's industrial past left behind 
many legacies, including the invention of Fluff by Archibald Query. In 
1914, the city became the home of the original Economy Grocery Store, which 
later grew into the Stop & Shop grocery chain. Two related food service 
chains, Steve's Ice Cream and Bertucci's, sprung from adjacent lots in 
Davis Square. Assembly Square Marketplace is a popular center of business 
in the city. Davis Square is home to the Somerville Theatre, which houses 
the Somerville branch of the Museum of Bad Art and plays host to the Independent 
Film Festival of Boston each spring. P.A.'s Lounge is a live music venue 
in the city. Two major art studios, the Brickbottom Artists Building and 
the Joy Street Studios, are located in former industrial buildings in the 
Brickbottom district. The Brickbottom Artists Association has been hosting 
annual open studio events in the fall since 1987.[60][61] Starlab Studios, 
a multimedia artist studio space and the host of Somerville's annual Starlabfest, 
opened in Union Square in 2009.[62][63] Additionally, Artisan's Asylum 
on Tyler Street between Union and Porter squares is a hackerspace, where 
150 members and 200 students have been participating in the maker culture 
since 2011.[64] The Somerville Arts Council[65] and Somerville Open Studios[66] 
both host annual events involving the community in homegrown arts. The 
Boston chapter of the Dorkbot community meets in Somerville at the Willoughby 
& Baltic studio,in the Brickbottom district. Starting in 2006, an annual 
Fluff Festival[67] has been held to celebrate the invention of Fluff in 
Somerville. "What the Fluff?" is produced by Union Square Main Streets 
and includes vendors, activities, entertainment and the crowning of the 
Pharaoh of Fluff. George Dilboy Memorial Stadium is a multi-purpose public 
stadium in city. It is known as the home of the Boston Renegades women's 
tackle football team. It was also the home field of the Boston Militia 
women's tackle football team from 2008 to 2014. The Boston Breakers women's 
soccer club made Dilboy Stadium their home in 2012 and 2013. The stadium 
is named after George Dilboy, who was awarded the Medal of Honor during 
World War I. Somerville has eighty-three sites listed on the National Register 
of Historic Places. These places include various houses, libraries, parkways, 
churches, among other places, and have been declared landmarks within the 
city. The Somerville Museum preserves memorabilia chronicling the city's 
roots, with historical and artistic exhibits.[68] It is located at 1 Westwood 
Road, on the corner of Central Street.[69] The Somerville Community Path 
is a tree-lined rail trail that runs from Lowell Street to the Cambridge 
border near Davis Square. It connects with the Alewife Linear Park, which 
in turn connects with the Minuteman Bikeway and the Fitchburg Cutoff Path. 
Community activists hope to extend the path eastward to Lechmere Square, 
which would connect with the Charles River Bike Paths and the proposed 
East Coast Greenway. In May 2013, construction began on an extension of 
the path between Cedar and Lowell streets,[70] which was completed in 2015.[71] 
As of 2010[update], the city has a total of 63 parks, playgrounds, playing 
fields, and community gardens.[72] Somerville has a mayor-city council 
form of municipal government. The Board of Aldermen consists of four at-large 
(city-wide) positions and seven ward representatives, where each ward is 
a specific section of the city.[73] The first Democratic mayor of the city 
was John J. Murphy in 1929. Every mayor prior, since 1872, had been unaffiliated 
with a party or Republican. Murphy succeeded on his seventh try by uniting 
the Irish, Italians, Greeks, and Portuguese communities. There were candlelit 
processions with thousands marching in rallies in the middle of Union Square 
and other squares in the city. The current mayor of Somerville is Joseph 
Curtatone. Somerville is part of Massachusetts's 7th congressional district 
for purposes of elections to the United States House of Representatives. 
It is represented by Representative Mike Capuano, formerly mayor of Somerville 
from 1990 to 1999.[74] For representation to the Massachusetts Senate, 
Somerville is entirely within the "Second Middlesex" district.[75] For 
representation to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, Somerville 
is part of the 26th, 27th, and 34th Middlesex districts.[76] The 26th Middlesex 
district includes East Somerville, Brickbottom, and a portion of the Union 
Square area, as well as portions of Cambridge, The 34th Middlesex district 
includes Winter Hill and Teele Square, as well as portions of Medford. 
The remainder of the city, just over half, comprises the 27th Middlesex 
district, which does not extend outside Somerville. Somerville Public Schools 
operates eleven schools from pre-kindergarten to secondary schools.[78] 
The East Somerville Community School, which was temporarily closed after 
a fire in 2007, had undergone demolition and reconstruction and has now 
reopened as of the Fall 2013. During its closure students were transferred 
to the nearby Edgerly and Capuano schools.[79] Also included in the school 
district is the Somerville Center for Adult Learning Experiences. The former 
Powder House Community School (which closed due to low enrollment in 2004) 
is being considered for redevelopment, either as a consolidated location 
for city offices if funding is obtained under the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009 or as some other type of development.[80] Though 
formally listed as being located in Medford, Tufts University is also located 
in Somerville. The Somerville–Medford line runs through the Tufts campus, 
splitting the university's Tisch Library. The school employs many local 
residents and has many community service projects that benefit the city, 
especially those run through the Leonard Carmichael Society[81] and the 
Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service. The city is 
served by a number of news sources, including: The public radio show Living 
on Earth is recorded in Davis Square. In addition, Candlewick Press, a 
major children's book printing company, is operated in Somerville. Bay 
State Newspaper Company, Highwater Books, and Radical America were all 
originally published in the city. Somerville, originally built as a streetcar 
suburb of Boston, has a framework and layout ideal for public transit. 
Its traditionally designed neighborhoods, which are set amongst grid-like 
street networks, connect in a walkable, transit-friendly system. Transit 
systems shrunk and all but disappeared as automobiles became the primary 
mode of transportation, however, and streetcars left the city several decades 
ago.[20] The City of Somerville is serviced by the Massachusetts Bay Transit 
Authority (MBTA) transit service. Somerville is served by two rapid transit 
stations, a Red Line station at Davis Square in the northwestern part of 
the city and an Orange Line station at Assembly Square in the eastern part 
of the city. The Red Line was extended to Alewife in the 1980s and the 
Davis station opened in Davis Square, in 1984.[82] Additionally, rail transit 
serves periphery points of Somerville. To the southwest, Porter Square 
station, located just over the Cambridge border in Porter Square, is a 
transfer station serving the Red Line and the commuter rail Fitchburg Line. 
To the east, there is an Orange Line station at Sullivan Square at the 
border with Charlestown.[83] Although the Orange Line had for decades passed 
through the Assembly Square neighborhood in eastern Somerville, it never 
stopped. However, construction on a new station between the existing Sullivan 
Square and Wellington stations broke ground in 2012 as part of the massive 
$1.5 billion Assembly Square redevelopment project. The Assembly station 
opened on September 2, 2014.[84] In September 2013, the state secured funding 
to move forward on the construction of two new Green line rapid transit 
stations in Somerville. As part of the long-delayed Green Line Extension 
project, new stations are expected to open in the Union Square and Brickbottom 
neighborhoods by 2017.[85] The Green Line Extension's proposed service 
consists of two distinct branches: a "mainline" branch, which will operate 
within the existing right-of-way of the MBTA Lowell Line commuter rail, 
beginning at a relocated Lechmere station in East Cambridge and traveling 
north through the Somerville neighborhood of Winter Hill all the way to 
College Avenue in Medford, near Tufts University; and a branch line operating 
within the existing right-of-way of the MBTA Fitchburg Line to Union Square 
in Somerville. There are seven new stations that are to be constructed 
as part of the project, including the relocated Lechmere Station.[86] While 
proposals to extend public transit service north from Lechmere date back 
many decades. However, it was in 1990 when Massachusetts agreed to a legally 
binding resolution to extend the line through Somerville to offset the 
additional burdens in traffic and pollution within the city due to completion 
of the Big Dig infrastructure. The current phase of planning began in 2005 
with the completion of the MBTA's "Beyond Lechmere Northwest Corridor Study 
Major Investment Study/Alternatives Analysis."[87] Despite this legal commitment, 
however, the Green Line Extension project lagged far behind schedule, prompting 
the City of Somerville and the Conservation Law Foundation to file a lawsuit 
to keep the project moving. In 2006, this litigation, with the help of 
community support and advocacy groups such as Somerville Transportation 
Equity Partnership (STEP) and the Union Square Task Force, finally brought 
about a multimillion-dollar state investment in planning for the Green 
Line Extension with mandated completion date of December 2014.[88] Controversy 
has surrounded the repeated delays by the state in providing funding for 
the project, most recently when Governor Deval Patrick decided to delay 
work an additional two years in order to seek up to $300 million in federal 
financing for the project.[88] Although only 43.6% of Somerville commuters 
drove alone to work in 2013, several major arteries pass through the city.[89] 
McGrath Highway is a major north-south route that represents the portion 
of Massachusetts Route 28 through the city of Somerville. McGrath is the 
continuation of Monsignor O'Brien Highway in Cambridge to the southeast 
and is known as the Fellsway north of the junction with Mystic Avenue and 
Interstate 93 in Medford.[90] The highway has a long and complex history 
that hints to the changing nature of transportation throughout Somerville 
and the greater Boston metropolitan region. Originally constructed in 1928 
to create a speedier connection for Route 28 between the Charles and Mystic 
Rivers, McGrath was elevated in the 1950s to further facilitate increased 
travel speed. The result was to cut off East Somerville and the Inner Belt 
District from Winter Hill and the rest of the city. When Route 28 was built, 
its primary purpose was to serve regional commuters traveling into Boston. 
However, it soon became clear that McGrath would need to be replaced by 
a larger and safer highway. The construction of the elevated Northern Expressway 
(Massachusetts), part of Interstate 93, was completed in the early 1970s 
and essentially rendered McGrath redundant. Today, the infrastructure of 
the two raised portions (the McCarthy Overpass, running from Somerville 
Avenue to Medford Street, and the Squires Bridge, running above the MBTA 
Fitchburg line near Twin City Plaza) are decaying and decrepit. In 2013, 
the Massachusetts Department of Transportation recommended that the McCarthy 
Overpass that crosses over several streets in Somerville be torn down, 
and proposed a boulevard-syle reconstruction with bike lanes and sidewalks 
for pedestrians. No date has been set for construction to begin.[25] Northern 
Expressway (Massachusetts) runs northwest and southeast through Somerville, 
separating Ten Hills and Assembly Square from the rest of the city. The 
massive elevated "Northern Expressway" was completed in the early 1970s 
and passes directly through Somerville running alongside and/or above Mystic 
Avenue (Massachusetts Route 38). Commonly referred to as the "upper and 
lower decks of 93," the Somerville-Charlestown section of the Northern 
Expressway carries three lanes of northbound traffic on the upper deck, 
and three lanes of southbound traffic on the lower deck. The highway also 
serves to cut off East Somerville from Charlestown.[91] Somerville is considered 
to be both a highly walkable[92] and bikeable[93] city. In 2013, 7.8% of 
all commutes were made by bicycle, making Somerville the 5th city in the 
country for its share of bicycling.[94] In 2013, 49.8% of Somerville commuters 
either walked, biked or used public transit.[94] Somerville launched its 
first Hubway stations during the summer of 2012 and hosts 12 stations.[95] 
The Somerville Community Path is a mixed-use path that runs along the old 
Boston and Lowell Railroad right-of-way from Davis Square across Somerville 
to the Cambridge border near Lechmere Square. Roughly 0.8 mile (1.3 km) 
of the path is finished and in use.[96] The two finished segments feature 
pavement interspersed with brick and surrounded by grass, trees, pedestrian 
connections to nearby streets, and a community garden. The path is lit 
at night and snowplowed in the winter. In 2013, the city broke ground on 
the first extension in almost twenty years that will extend the path another 
0.25 mile (1.3 km) east from its current terminus at Cedar Street, to Lowell 
Street.[97] The City of Somerville has among the highest bus ridership 
in the Boston metro area. Nearly 40,000 passengers board the buses that 
pass through Somerville each day, and 15 MBTA bus routes operate in Somerville.[98] 
The School Committee is composed of seven independently elected officials, 
plus the Mayor and President of the Board of Aldermen.[99] The budget is 
approved by both the School Committee and the Board of Aldermen.[100] The 
Chair is Adam Sweeting from Ward 3 and the Vice-Chair is Carrie Normand 
from Ward 7.[101] With the establishment of the Playground Association 
of America in 1906, many cities, including Somerville, began to sponsor 
supervised playgrounds for the children of the city during the summer months. 
Though the Recreation Department was not formally established in Somerville 
until 1917, supervised play, sponsored in part by the city and the Playground 
Association of America, began in 1909. The Recreation Department provides 
many recreational and play activities for residents of all ages, including 
Summertime Playgrounds, outdoor games and sports leagues, theater groups, 
and an active Senior Citizens Club.[102] See also People from Somerville,
