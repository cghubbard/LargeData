Homer Elliott "Dixie" Howell (April 24, 1920 – October 5, 1990) was an 
American professional baseball player. Born in Louisville, Kentucky, he 
was a catcher who appeared in 340 games in Major League Baseball over eight 
seasons between 1947 and 1956 for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds 
and Brooklyn Dodgers. He threw and batted right-handed, stood 5 feet 11 inches 
(1.80 m) tall and weighed 190 pounds (86 kg). Howell's professional career 
began in 1938 after his graduation from Louisville Male High School. By 
1941, he had been acquired by the Dodgers and was playing for their top 
affiliate, the Montreal Royals of the International League. With the outbreak 
of World War II, he served in the United States Army in the European Theater 
of Operations[1] and missed the 1944–45 seasons. In 1946 he returned to 
Montreal and split catching duties for the Royals with left-handed-batting 
Herman Franks. The 1946 Royals, led by second baseman Jackie Robinson, 
won the league championship and the Little World Series, but are famous 
as the first racially integrated team in "organized baseball" since the 
1880s. Howell witnessed Robinson's constant battle against intimidation—especially 
in the form of brushback pitches. "I was with Jackie on Montreal", Howell 
told Roger Kahn in 1953. "The way he was thrown at that year was unbelievable. 
Unbelievable and disgraceful."[2] "You never saw anything like it", Howell 
said in a Los Angeles Times interview published eight months before his 
1990 death. "Every time he came up, he'd go down!"[3] According to Robinson 
biographer Arnold Rampersad, Howell was one of two Southern-born Montreal 
players (with Marv Rackley) who personally wished Robinson well on his 
promotion to the parent Dodgers in April 1947,[4] breaking the baseball 
color line. Howell also made his Major League debut in 1947, but not for 
the Dodgers. On May 3, he was traded to the Pirates in a multi-player transaction 
headlined by former Brooklyn starting pitcher Kirby Higbe, and played his 
first MLB game three days later, going hitless in three at bats against 
the Boston Braves' ace right-hander, Johnny Sain.[5] Howell and Clyde Kluttz 
served as the Bucs' two primary catchers in 1947 and Howell batted an MLB-career-high 
.276, but at the end of the season he was traded to the Triple-A San Francisco 
Seals, and spent 1948 in the Pacific Coast League. Selected by Cincinnati 
in the 1948 Rule 5 draft, Howell spent the next four seasons (1949–52) 
in the big leagues with the Reds, serving as their most-used catcher in 
both 1950 and 1951. But in 1952, the Reds traded for veteran receiver Andy 
Seminick and Howell appeared in only 17 games. In October, the Dodgers 
reacquired him for pitcher Clyde King. He played mostly at Triple-A in 
1953 and 1954 (when he returned to the Montreal Royals), but spent the 
entire 1955 season on Brooklyn's National League roster. Playing behind 
Roy Campanella and Rube Walker, Howell got into only 16 games (13 in the 
field and nine as a starting catcher). But he batted a creditable .262, 
and participated in another memorable season that saw Brooklyn win its 
only world championship, a seven-game triumph over the New York Yankees 
in the 1955 World Series. Howell, however, did not appear in the World 
Series. Howell was sent back to the Royals for most of the 1956 campaign, 
but was recalled by the pennant-bound Dodgers in August for his final seven 
games of Major League service. He collected three hits and started in four 
games, but did not participate in the 1956 World Series, a rematch between 
the Dodgers and Yankees won by the Bombers in seven games. Howell's career 
then continued in the minor leagues in 1957–58 before his retirement from 
the field. As a big leaguer, he collected 224 hits, with 39 doubles and 
four triples accompanying his 12 home runs. He is one of three Dixie Howells 
to have played professional baseball, and his big-league career coincided 
with that of pitcher Millard "Dixie" Howell, also a Kentuckian. Both Dixie
