As player As manager Edward Trowbridge Collins, Sr. (May 2, 1887 – March 
25, 1951), nicknamed "Cocky", was an American Major League Baseball second 
baseman, manager and executive. He played from 1906 to 1930 for the Philadelphia 
Athletics and Chicago White Sox. A graduate of Columbia University, Collins 
holds major league career records in several categories and is among the 
top few players in several other categories. Collins coached and managed 
in the major leagues after retiring as a player. He also served as general 
manager of the Boston Red Sox. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of 
Fame in 1939. He died several years later after having suffered from heart 
problems for a number of years. As a native of Millerton, a 384-acre village 
in Dutchess County, New York, Collins was unique in his time in that he 
was focused on both his athletic skills and his education and intelligence. 
He graduated from Columbia University (where he was a member of Beta Theta 
Pi fraternity), at a time when few major league players had attended college. 
He started his American professional baseball career on September 17, 1906 
when he signed with the Philadelphia Athletics at the age of 19.[1] When 
he signed with the Philadelphia organization, Collins was still a student 
at Columbia. He played some of his initial minor league games under the 
last name of Sullivan so that he could protect his collegiate status.[2] 
After spending all but 14 games of the 1907 season in the minor leagues,[3] 
he played in 102 games in 1908 and by 1909 was a full-time player. That 
season, he registered a .347 batting average and 67 steals. He would also 
be named the A's starting second baseman in 1909, a position he would play 
for the rest of his career, after seeing time at second, third, short, 
and the outfield the previous two seasons. In 1910, Collins stole a career-high 
81 bases and played on the first of his six World Series championship teams. 
As a player, Collins was renowned for his intelligence and confidence on 
and off the field, and on the field his exceptional batting skills as a 
top-ten hitter and his speed was known for having the only six-steal game 
in history, and he achieved that feat twice in two weeks, September 11 
and September 22, 1912. He was part of the Athletics' so-called "$100,000 
infield" (and the highest-paid of the quartet) which propelled the team 
to four American League (AL) pennants and three World Series titles between 
1910 and 1914. He earned the league's Chalmers Award (early Most Valuable 
Player recognition) in 1914. In 1914, the newly formed Federal League disrupted 
major league contract stability by luring away established stars from the 
AL and NL with inflated salaries. To retain Collins, Athletics manager 
Connie Mack offered his second baseman the longest guaranteed contract 
(five years) that had ever been offered to a player. Collins declined, 
and after the 1914 season Mack sold Collins to the White Sox for $50,000, 
the highest price ever paid for a player up to that point. The Sox paid 
Collins $15,000 for 1915, making him the third highest paid player in the 
league, behind Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker. In Chicago, Collins continued 
to post top-ten batting and stolen base numbers, and he helped the Sox 
capture pennants in 1917 and 1919. He was part of the notorious "Black 
Sox" team that threw the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. However 
Collins was not accused of being part of the conspiracy and was considered 
to have played honestly (his low .226 batting average notwithstanding). 
In August 1924, he was named player-manager of the White Sox and held the 
position through the 1926 season, posting a record of 174-160 (.521). Collins 
returned to Philadelphia to rejoin the Athletics in 1927 as a player-coach. 
He recorded only 143 plate appearances in his last four years, mostly as 
a pinch hitter. He did not play in any World Series games for the 1929 
or 1930 World Series champion A's and his last appearance as a player was 
on August 2, 1930. Collins finished his career with 1,300 runs batted in. 
To date, Collins is the only MLB player to play for two teams for at least 
12 seasons each. Upon his retirement, he ranked second in major league 
history in career games (2,826), walks (1,499) and stolen bases (744), 
third in runs scored (1,821), fourth in hits (3,315) and at bats (9,949), 
sixth in on-base percentage (.424), and eighth in total bases (4,268); 
he was also fourth in AL history in triples (187). He still holds the major 
league record of 512 career sacrifice bunts, over 100 more than any other 
player. He was the first major leaguer in modern history to steal 80 bases 
in a season, and still shares the major league record of six steals in 
a game, which he accomplished twice in September 1912. He regularly batted 
over .320, retiring with a career average of .333. He also holds major 
league records for career games (2,650), assists (7,630) and total chances 
(14,591) at second base, and ranks second in putouts (6,526). Collins is 
one of only 29 players in baseball history to have appeared in major league 
games in four decades. Following the A's 1930 World Series victory, Collins 
officially retired as a player and immediately stepped into a full-time 
position as coach for the A's. After two seasons as a coach, Collins was 
hired as the general manager of the Boston Red Sox. The new owner, Tom 
Yawkey, was a close friend and had actually bought the Red Sox at Collins' 
suggestion. He remained GM until the 1947 season, retiring at age 60 after 
a period of declining health.[4] During his 15 years as general manager, 
Collins helped turn a dreadful team into a contender once again. On the 
debit side, he instituted an unofficial policy of not signing black players 
(an unofficial league-wide policy that stayed in place until Jackie Robinson's 
signing by Brooklyn Dodgers GM Branch Rickey and Robinson's debut with 
the AAA Montreal Royals in 1946). Author Howard Bryant writes that Collins' 
prejudice also extended to Jews and Catholics.[5] Collins was inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939. He struggled with heart problems 
for several years at the end of his life. He was admitted to a hospital 
in Boston on March 10, 1951 and he died there of the heart condition on 
March 25.[6] In 1999, he was ranked number 24 on The Sporting News' list 
of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League 
Baseball All-Century Team. He played on a total of six World Series-winning 
teams (1910, 1911, 1913, 1917, 1929, and 1930), though he did not participate 
in any of the final two series' games. Under the win shares statistical 
rating system created by baseball historian and analyst Bill James, Collins 
was the greatest second baseman of all time. His son, Eddie Jr., was an 
outfielder who played for Yale University.[7] He briefly saw major league 
action (in 1939 and 1941–42, all with the A's) and later worked in the
