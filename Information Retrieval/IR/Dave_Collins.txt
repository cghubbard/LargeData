in the first round of the 1972 draft from Mesa Community College by the 
California Angels. He made his professional debut with the Angels Rookie 
ball team in Idaho Falls and moved up through the Angels farm system, with 
stops in Single-A Quad City and Salinas, Double-A El Paso and Triple-A 
Salt Lake City. He was dubbed "fastest white man in baseball" because he 
ran the 100 yard dash in 9.6 seconds and had high stolen base totals. He 
made his major league debut for the Angels on June 7, 1975, playing left 
field and batting leadoff, against the Milwaukee Brewers. He recorded his 
first career hit the following day against Brewers pitcher Tom Murphy. 
After two seasons as a utility player and reserve outfielder with the Angels, 
he was selected by the Seattle Mariners with the 14th pick in the 1976 
Major League Baseball expansion draft. He was the first batter for the 
Mariners in their first game, and scored the franchise's first run two 
days later.[1] After that 1977 season, the Mariners traded Collins to the 
Cincinnati Reds for Shane Rawley, and he spent the subsequent four seasons 
with the Reds. He hit .318 in 1979 and .303 in 1980, during which he also 
stole 79 bases. Collins was signed by the New York Yankees as a free agent 
prior to the 1982 season, and was then traded with Mike Morgan, Fred McGriff 
and cash to the Toronto Blue Jays in 1983 for Tom Dodd and Dale Murray. 
He hit .271 and .308 in his two seasons in Toronto, and currently holds 
the Blue Jays single season stolen base record with 60 steals in 1984. 
He was traded again, by the Blue Jays, (along with Alfredo Griffin and 
cash) to the Oakland Athletics for Bill Caudill in December 1984. Coliins 
hit .251 in 112 games for Oakland during the 1985 season and was then traded 
to the Detroit Tigers for BÃ¡rbaro Garbey in November 1985. As a part-time 
outfielder with Detroit, he hit .270 and stole 27 bases. Picked up by the 
Montreal Expos as a free agent after the season, he was then cut during 
spring training and signed by the Cincinnati Reds, with whom he had previously 
had the most success. Used as a fourth outfielder/pinch hitter by the Reds, 
he found some success in the role, hitting .294 in 1987, but his average 
dropped to .236 in 1988 and 1989 and he was released. Collins played one 
last season, in 1990, with the St. Louis Cardinals, batting .224 in 99 
games as a first baseman. He played briefly for the Fort Myers Sun Sox 
of the Senior Professional Baseball Association after his retirement from 
the majors. He finished with a career batting average of .272 in his 16-year 
career, with 1,335 hits. Presently; Volunteering at the lighthouse correctional
