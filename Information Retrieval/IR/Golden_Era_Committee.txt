The Golden Era Committee ("The Committee") is one of three 16-member committees 
of National Baseball Hall of Fame members, appointed by the Board of Directors 
of the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010 to replace the former Veterans 
Committee to consider and elect eligible candidates to the Hall of Fame 
not eligible by the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) ballot. 
Beginning in 2011, the Golden Era Committee (consisting of eight Hall of 
Fame members, five executives, and three media members) considers and then 
elects (first election, December 5) to the Hall of Fame every 3 years, 
retired Major League Baseball players that are no longer eligible for election 
by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BWAA) along with managers, 
umpires, and executives from the 1947 to 1972 era.[1] The BWAA appointed-Historical 
Overview Committee of 10 to 12 representatives is the Screening Committee 
beginning in 2011, that identifies ten Golden Era candidates for possible 
election to the Hall of Fame each fall before the Golden Era Committee's 
winter meeting election. All candidates receiving votes on at least 75% 
of ballots cast will earn election.[2] (Major League Baseball Winter Meeting, 
December 5, 2011) The Baseball Hall of Fame officially named this group 
the "Golden Era Committee" ("The Committee"), which voted for the first 
time on December 5, 2011: The Golden Era Committee elected Ron Santo to 
the National Baseball Hall of Fame with 15 out of 16 of their votes. With 
a 75 percent vote needed for election,[3] Santo was the first and only 
Golden Era Ballot candidate (10)[4] elected to the Hall of Fame Class of 
2012.[5] The Hall of Fame induction ceremony was held on Sunday, July 22, 
2012 in Cooperstown, New York.[6] (Major League Baseball Winter Meeting, 
December 8, 2014) The Golden Era Committee's 16-member voting electorate, 
appointed by the Hall of Fame's Board of Directors, was announced at the 
same time as the ballot of 10 candidates.[7] All of the Hall of Fame members 
on this committee were inducted as players, except for executive Pat Gillick. 
The ballot for election by the Golden Era Committee was released on October 
30, 2014;[8] the committee voted at the MLB winter meetings in San Diego 
on December 8, 2014, with the results announced by MLB immediately thereafter. 
The cutoff for election and summer 2015 induction remained the standard 
75%, or 12 of 16 votes.[7] None of the candidates received enough votes, 
continuing a long period of difficulty in electing players eligible under 
the Hall's special committees; the last living player elected to the Hall 
after the expiration of their BBWAA eligibility was Bill Mazeroski in 2001.[9]
