The 1945 Detroit Tigers was the team's 45th since they entered the American 
League in 1901. The team won the American League pennant, then went on 
to win the 1945 World Series, defeating the Chicago Cubs 4 games to 3. 
It was the second World Series championship for the Tigers. Detroit pitcher 
Hal Newhouser was named the American League's Most Valuable Player for 
the second consecutive season. The catching duties were split between Bob 
Swift (94 games) and Paul Richards (83 games). Swift hit .233, and Richards 
.256. Richards got the nod as the starting catcher in the World Series. 
Swift took over as the Tigers' manager in 1965 after Chuck Dressen was 
felled by two heart attacks. Later that year, Swift was diagnosed with 
lung cancer and died in October at age 51. Richards went on to be a manager 
for the White Sox (1951–54), Orioles (1955–61), and Braves (1966–72). First 
baseman Rudy York was among the American League leaders in home runs for 
11 consecutive seasons from 1937 to 1947, and his .503 slugging percentage 
as a Tiger ranks #4 in franchise history. In 1945, York hit .264 with 18 
home runs and 87 RBIs. York had a poor World Series in 1945, playing in 
all seven games, but batting only .179 with no home runs. Prior to 1944, 
second baseman Eddie Mayo had never hit for a batting average higher than 
.227. Yet in 1945, Mayo hit for a .285 average and .347 on base percentage 
with 24 doubles and a career-high 10 home runs. Mayo also won his second 
Gold Glove award in 1945 and led all American League second basemen with 
a .980 fielding percentage. Selected for the American League All-Star team, 
he had the highest batting average among Tigers players with at least 300 
at bats. Hal Newhouser credited Mayo for sparking the Tigers' 1945 pennant 
drive, calling him the "take-charge guy in our infield." Mayo finished 
second to Newhouser in the AL MVP voting. Newhouser had 9 first place votes, 
and Mayo had 7. Traded to the Tigers after the 1944 season, shortstop Skeeter 
Webb proved to be a liability at bat, as he hit only .199. Though he was 
a fine fielder, many believed he held onto the starting shortstop job despite 
his weak hitting because he was married to the daughter of Tigers' manager 
Steve O'Neill. In Game 7 of the World Series, Skeeter had his best performance, 
scoring two runs and fielding the final out of the Series. Third baseman 
Bob Maier played only one season in the big leagues, but he spent that 
season on a championship team. Maier played in 132 games for the 1945 Tigers, 
batting .263 with 58 runs, 34 RBIs, 25 doubles, 7 triples, and 7 stolen 
bases. Though he was the starting third baseman during the regular season, 
the starting job went to Jimmy Outlaw in the World Series, as Outlaw moved 
from the outfield to third base to make room for Hank Greenberg who had 
returned from military service in July. Maier had a pinch-hit single Game 
6 of the 1945 World Series, which turned to be his last major league at 
bat. Jimmy Outlaw was the left fielder for the first half of the season, 
but he was replaced by Hank Greenberg when he returned from the war in 
July. After Greenberg returned, Outlaw played 21 games at third base, 17 
games in center field and 8 games in right field. Outlaw hit .271 in 132 
games. Greenberg had missed four seasons to military service, but rejoined 
the Tigers after his discharge on July 1, 1945. At age 34, Greenberg picked 
up where he left off, hitting a home run in his first game. Without the 
benefit of spring training, he returned to the Tigers, was again voted 
to the All-Star Team, and hit a dramatic pennant-clinching grand slam home 
run in the 9th inning on the last day of the regular season. He also set 
a major league record with 11 multi-homer games in 1945. Center fielder 
Doc Cramer, nicknamed "Flit", was a veteran player who had been playing 
in the major leagues since 1929. He ended his career with 2,705 hits. In 
1945, at age 40, he was the oldest player on an old team. He hit .275 with 
58 RBIs in the regular season and led the team with a .379 batting average 
in the 1945 World Series, scoring seven runs and batting in four. Shortly 
before the 1945 season started, right fielder Roy Cullenbine was traded 
by the Indians to the Tigers. Cullenbine was raised in Detroit and started 
his career as a Tiger but was declared a free agent by Judge Landis in 
1940. In 1945, Cullenbine led the American League with 113 walks and was 
2nd in the AL with a .402 on-base percentage. He also hit for power in 
1945, with 18 home runs (tied with Rudy York for 2nd in the AL), 93 RBIs 
(2nd in the AL), 51 extra base hits (4th in the AL), and a .444 slugging 
percentage (3rd in the AL). Despite batting only .227 in the Series, Cullenbine 
walked 8 times for a .433 on-base percentage and scored five runs. The 
starting pitchers were Hal Newhouser, Dizzy Trout, Al Benton, Stubby Overmire, 
and Les Mueller. Hal Newhouser, also known as "Prince Hal", won 25 games 
and was named the American League's Most Valuable Player for the second 
consecutive season. He was the first pitcher in the history of the American 
League to win the MVP for two consecutive seasons.[1] Newhouser won the 
pitching triple crown, leading the American League in wins (25, against 
nine losses), ERA (1.81) and strikeouts (212). He also led the league in 
innings pitched (313⅓), games started (36), complete games (29), and shutouts 
(8). Newhouser also won two games in the World Series, including the deciding 
seventh game. Newhouser and Greenberg were the only two players from the 
1945 Tigers who were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Al Benton missed 
the 1943 and 1944 seasons while serving in the U.S. Navy during World War 
II. He was discharged from the Navy in November 1944 and had his best year 
in 1945. He compiled a record of 13–8, a career-low 2.02 ERA, five shutouts, 
and 12 complete games in 191.2 innings. In a remarkable testament to the 
Tigers' pitching in 1945, Newhouser and Benton were No. 1 and No. 2 in 
ERA among AL pitchers. Newhouser's Adjusted ERA+ in 1945 was 195 and Benton's 
was 175. The Adjusted ERA+ figures posted by Newhouser and Benton in 1945 
rank as the 1st and 5th best seasons all time for a Detroit Tigers pitcher 
with at least 150 innings pitched. (See Detroit Tigers team records) After 
winning 20 games in 1943 and 27 games in 1944, Dizzy Trout won 18 games 
in 1945 and was a workhorse in the pennant drive. He pitched six games 
and won four over a nine-game late-season stretch. In Game 4 of the 1945 
World Series, Trout beat the Cubs 4–1 on a five-hitter. Trout went 1–1 
in the Series with an ERA of 0.66. The Tigers #4 starter in 1945 was Stubby 
Overmire. He won 9 games and started Game 3 of the 1945 World Series against 
the Chicago Cubs. Despite giving up only 2 runs in 6 innings, Overmire 
took the loss as the Tigers were shut out 3–0. After service in the Navy, 
Virgil Trucks returned to the Tigers on the last day of the regular season. 
He got the start in the final game (allowing 1 run in 5⅓ innings), in which 
the Tigers clinched the pennant. To help returning veterans, the Commissioner 
waived the rule requiring a player to be on the roster on September 1 to 
be eligible for World Series play. Trucks was the winning pitcher in Game 
2 of the World Series. Though he had a record of 6–8, pitcher Les Mueller 
appeared in 26 games and played an important role in the 1945 Tigers season. 
After missing the 1942–1944 seasons to military service, Mueller gave up 
a single to Pete Gray, the St. Louis Browns' famous one-armed outfielder, 
in Gray's first major league game in April 1945. Three months later, on 
July 21, 1945, Mueller pitched the first 19⅔ innings for the Tigers and 
left having given up only 1 run. No pitcher has thrown as many innings 
in a major league game since Mueller's feat. The game lasted 4 hours and 
48 minutes before the game was called due to darkness. Mueller also pitched 
2 scoreless innings in Game 1 of the 1945 World Series. Relief pitching 
was split between George Caster (who was selected off waivers from the 
St. Louis Browns on August 8, 1945),[2] Walter Wilson, Zeb Eaton, and Art 
Houtteman. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Infielders Other batters Coaches

Cubs, with the Tigers winning in seven games for their second championship 
in six World Series appearances. To minimize travel due to wartime restrictions, 
the first three games were played in Detroit, and the remaining four games 
at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Because of the depleted talent pool resulting 
from many players being in the military, the Tigers and the Cubs both fielded 
teams that would have been considered mediocre before or after the war. 
Warren Brown, author of a 1946 history of the Cubs, commented on this by 
titling his chapter on the 1945 World Series, "World's Worst Series". Sportswriter 
Frank Graham jokingly called this Series "the fat men versus the tall men 
at the office picnic." In Game 1, Detroit ace Hal Newhouser gave up four 
runs in the first inning and three more in the third. Pitching for the 
Cubs in his first of four games in the 1945 Series, Hank Borowy threw a 
six-hit shutout to defeat the Tigers, 9–0. In Game 2, Virgil Trucks got 
the start less than a week after his discharge from the U.S. Navy. Trucks 
held the Cubs to 1 run, and Hank Greenberg hit a three-run home run in 
the fifth inning. The Tigers won, 4–1, to even the Series. In Game 3, the 
Tigers were shut out by Cubs pitcher Claude Passeau. Passeau allowed only 
one hit—a single by Rudy York. The Tigers lost, 3–0. In Game 4, Dizzy Trout 
helped even the Series, allowing only 5 hits and 1 run. The Tigers won, 
4–1. In Game 5, Hal Newhouser faced Hank Borowy. Newhouser struck out 9 
Cubs, and Hank Greenberg hit three doubles off Borowy. The Tigers won 8–4. 
In Game 6, Hank Greenberg hit a home run in the eighth inning to tie the 
score, but the Cubs won, 8–7, in extra innings. The game ended in the 12th 
inning with a line drive by Stan Hack that took a bad hop past Greenberg 
in left field. Initially, Greenberg was charged with an error, but the 
call was reversed the next morning, and Hack was credited with a double. 
Game 6 is also remembered for Chuck Hostetler's baserunning blunder. The 
42-year-old Hostetler had debuted the previous year as the oldest rookie 
in MLB history. He reached base in Game 6 on an error to start the 6th 
inning. He advanced to second with one out, and when Doc Cramer hit a single 
to left field, Hostetler ran through manager Steve O'Neill's stop sign 
at third base. He tried to put on his brakes half way home, lost his footing, 
fell to the ground, and was tagged out while scrambling around on all fours. 
The Tigers could have avoided extra innings and won the Series in Game 
6 if Hostetler had held up, as he would have scored in the rally that followed. 
Hostetler did not appear in another major league game.[3] Fifty years later, 
baseball writer Joe Falls recalled Hostetler's blunder in a column in the 
Detroit News, writing: "If anyone symbolized the futility of wartime baseball 
—both in Detroit and America — it was outfielder Chuck Hostetler of the 
Tigers, the man who fell on his face in the 1945 World Series."[4] In Game 
7, Cubs' manager Charlie Grimm gave the start to Hank Borowy despite his 
having pitched in Games 1, 5, and 6. The Tigers scored five runs off Borowy 
in the 1st inning, while Hal Newhouser struck out 10 and held the Cubs 
to three runs. Doc Cramer went 3-for-5, and Paul Richards hit a bases-loaded 
double in the first inning to clear the bses and give Newhouser a lead. 
In all, Richards had two doubles and four RBIs to lead the Tigers in Game 
7. The Tigers won the game, 9–3. The day after the Tigers' Game 7 victory, 
H. G. Salsinger wrote in the Detroit News that pitching was the key to 
the Tigers' success: "Detroit beat the Cubs with TNT, meaning Trucks, Newhouser, 
and Trout, and they beat them twice with 'N.'"[5] A little known fact about 
the 1945 World Series is that teenage boys worked the games as the ushers 
in the stands. With most able bodied men away at war, young teenage boys 
were allowed to work as ushers. The boys would line up at the gate outside 
Briggs Stadium before the game and would be selected in a fashion similar 
to how migrant workers are selected to work today. The boys would volunteer 
their services, but would receive tips. Note: G = Games played; AB = At
