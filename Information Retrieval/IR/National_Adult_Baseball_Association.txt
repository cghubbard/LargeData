The National Adult Baseball Association (NABA) is an adult, amateur baseball 
organization, headquartered in Denver, Colorado.[1][2][3] It offers competitive 
and recreational baseball for players in over 125 leagues in over 40 U.S. 
states.[4] Over 25,000 player-members participate. The NABA is organized 
into groups categorized by age. The largest division of play is the Open 
Division (18 & Over), but there are also divisions for 25 Wood, 25 Aluminum, 
35 Wood, 35 Aluminum, 45 Wood, 45 Aluminum, 50 Wood, 55 Wood, and 60 Wood. 
Where participation levels permit, leagues are divided into two or more 
competitive divisions. These divisions are then classified by experience 
level. The advanced level (AAA) is typically for players who have 3â€“4 years 
of college baseball and/or professional baseball experience. The intermediate 
level (AA) is generally for the players with high school baseball or some 
college experience. Finally, the recreational level (A) provides an opportunity 
for players whose love of the game perhaps exceeds their level of experience. 
In 2007 the Wombats won the championship in the final season of the Vernon 
CT chapter of the league.[24] The NABA Hall of Fame was established in
