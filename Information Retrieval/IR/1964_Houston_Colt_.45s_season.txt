The 1964 Houston Colt .45s season was the team's third season in Major 
League Baseball. It involved the Houston Colt .45s finishing in ninth place 
in the National League with a record of 66–96, 27 games behind the eventual 
World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals. It was their final season for 
the team at Colt Stadium before relocating their games to the Astrodome 
in 1965, along with the accompanying name change to the "Astros" for the 
'65 season. On April 8, just a few days before Opening Day, Colt .45s pitcher 
Jim Umbricht died of cancer. Umbricht had come back from cancer in 1963 
to pitch in 35 games, but it returned during the offseason. His uniform 
number 32 would be retired by the Astros the following season. On April 
23, Houston pitcher Ken Johnson became the first pitcher in major league 
history to lose a complete game no-hitter in nine innings when he was beaten 
1–0 by the Cincinnati Reds.[2] Cincinnati's Pete Rose scored the only run 
of the game in the ninth inning, when he reached second base on an error 
and later scored. Infielders Coaches [3] Note: Pos = Position; G = Games
