The Lansing Lugnuts are a Class A minor league baseball team, affiliated 
with the Toronto Blue Jays, that plays in the Midwest League. The Midwest 
League came to Lansing, Michigan after owners Tom Dickson and Sherrie Myers 
moved the team to work with the City for a public-private lease to build 
a new stadium. Mayor David Hollister, and the City Council worked to attract 
the owners and build the stadium for downtown economic development. The 
team began playing in downtown Lansing in 1996. The franchise began as 
the Lafayette Red Sox in Lafayette, Indiana, in 1955; after two seasons 
it became the Waterloo Hawks, moving to Waterloo, Iowa, where it stayed 
for 36 seasons. Before the 1994 season it moved to Springfield, Illinois, 
but only spent two seasons there before moving to Lansing. The franchise 
was an affiliate of the Kansas City Royals on two separate occasions in 
three different cities: as the Waterloo Royals[2] from 1969 through 1976, 
as the Sultans of Springfield[3] in 1995, and then, upon the team's move 
to Lansing, from 1996 through 1998. The Lugnuts were then an affiliate 
of the Chicago Cubs from 1999 through 2004 before joining the Jays' farm 
system for the 2005 season. In September 2014, the Jays extended their 
agreement with the Lugnuts through the 2016 season.[4] The team plays at 
Cooley Law School Stadium (previously known as Oldsmobile Park and named 
after the now-defunct General Motors division that was based there), which 
opened in 1996. The new name comes from a naming rights deal with Thomas 
M. Cooley Law School, based in Lansing and the largest law school in the 
United States. Cooley Law School Stadium is also the home of Jackson Field, 
named after Jackson Life Insurance, based in Lansing. The stadium seats 
over 10,000 fans and is one of the most handicapped accessible stadiums 
in the country. The franchise national attendance record of 538,326 was 
set during its inaugural year. They won the Midwest League Championship 
in 1997 and 2003. The Lugnuts have their own original song which plays 
immediately after the national anthem for every home game accompanied by 
their friendly oversized mascot, Big Lug. From 2007–present the Lansing 
Lugnuts have participated in an exhibition with nearby Michigan State University 
which draws a large crowd of students to the event. The overall record 
and attendance for each game is as follows: Jesse Goldberg-Strassler and 
Kevin Gehl broadcast Lugnuts home and away games on WQTX 92.1. Previously, 
Lugnuts games aired on WJIM-AM from 1996–2000 and WVFN-AM from 2001–2003. 
Several games per season aired on WLNS-TV from 1996 through 2001. From 
2002 to 2009, one game aired each season on WILX-TV. Erik 'Doc' Love serves 
as the PA announcer at Cooley Law School Stadium. The following are players
