The Olympic Council of Ireland or OCI (Irish: Comhairle Oilimpeach na hÉireann[3]) 
(called the Irish Olympic Council until 1952[4]) is the National Olympic 
Committee (NOC) of the Republic of Ireland, although athletes from Northern 
Ireland may also participate in it, as well as in the Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland Olympic team. Its mission statement is "To manage and 
enhance the performance of Team Ireland at Olympic Games whilst developing 
the Olympic Movement in Ireland."[5] The Irish Olympic Council was founded 
in 1920, while the Irish War of Independence was pitting the Irish Republic 
proclaimed by Sinn Féin against the Dublin Castle administration of the 
United Kingdom. John J. Keane, who was the head of the athletics committee 
of the Gaelic Athletic Association, met Sinn Féin leaders Arthur Griffith 
and Michael Collins in Vaughan's Hotel, Parnell Square, in April to discuss 
the possibility of a separate Irish team at the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp.[1] 
The founding Council members were mostly Irish republican or nationalist 
political leaders.[1] Keane wrote to the Baron de Coubertin, who was sympathetic, 
but the Belgian organising committee deferred to the British Olympic Association 
(BOA), which took the unionist view that Irish competitors should be part 
of the British team.[1] By August, Keane was proposing that a separate 
Irish delegation should march under the Union Jack, on the model of Finland 
at the 1912 Summer Olympics when part of the Russian Empire.[1][2] The 
International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to "suspend all decision 
until the moment when the Irish question would be solved politically".[1][2] 
Keane applied again in April 1922, during the provisional administration 
that was preparing for the formal establishment of the Irish Free State 
that December.[6] De Coubertin was worried that the Tailteann Games were 
intended to rival the Olympics, and the BOA's delegate was unsure of the 
political outlook in the buildup to the Irish Civil War.[6] Keane allayed 
these worries such that the Irish Olympic Council was affiliated to the 
IOC on 3 June 1922.[2][6] Most sports affiliated to the Council are all-island 
in scope. Two exceptions in 1922 were athletics and cycling, each of which 
had rival bodies; the prospect of Olympic competition precipitated their 
merging into a unified National Athletic and Cycling Association (NACA), 
which affiliated to the Council in 1924.[7] The Council has sent a team 
to all but one of the Summer Olympic Games since 1924. The 1936 Games were 
boycotted; this was the first Games after the IAAF's 1934 ruling on borders 
which restricted the NACA's jurisdiction to the Free State.[8] In 1952, 
the Council changed its own name from "Irish Olympic Council" to "Olympic 
Council of Ireland" to reinforce its claim to represent the whole island 
of Ireland rather than merely the Republic.[4] Its team competed as "Eire" 
in 1948 and "Republic of Ireland" in 1952 before reverting to its preferred 
name "Ireland" in 1956 after Lord Killanin secured the agreement of Avery 
Brundage.[4] The OCI and BOA have an agreement that Northern Irish sportspeople 
may compete for either team.[9] The OCI has sent teams to most Winter Olympic 
Games since 1992. On 5 August 2016, the day of the 2016 Summer Olympics 
opening ceremony, police in Rio de Janeiro arrested two people for attempted 
illegal resale of hundreds of tickets allocated to the OCI. One of the 
two was employed by THG Sports, which was the OCI's authorised ticket reseller 
(ATR) in 2012 but not 2016; the OCI denied any involvement. Shane Ross, 
the Irish Minister for Sport, promised a "robust inquiry".[10][11] Pro 
10 Sports Management, the OCI's 2016 ATR, said the man arrested was working 
as their agent to distribute tickets which had been paid for legitimately.[12] 
On 17 August, Pat Hickey, the OCI president, was arrested in Rio in connection 
with the investigation.[13] The issue, together with the allocation of 
tickets for other Olympic events, is now being investigated by a non-statutory 
inquiry headed by retired High Court judge, Mr Justice Carroll Moran.[14] 
The OCI has a small staff under a Chief Executive,[15] and is based at 
Olympic House in Howth, County Dublin.[16] The offices of President and 
IOC delegate are honorary, as required by the Olympic Charter.[17] Presidents 
of the OCI:[18][19] Delegates at the IOC:[18][19] While the Olympic Charter 
mandates that the area of jurisdiction of a NOC must coincide with the 
limits of the country in which it is established and has its headquarters,[22] 
it does not require this for the national federations of particular sports 
affiliated to the NOC.[23] Many bodies affiliated to the OCI are organised 
on an all-island basis, and have selected competitors from Northern Ireland 
for the Olympics. The following organisations are affiliated, some of which 
are very small and share an address at "Sport HQ" in Park West business 
park:[24] Notes: Baseball Ireland was formerly affiliated to the OCI,[40] 
but is no longer listed since baseball was removed from the list of Olympic
