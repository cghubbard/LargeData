The 1986 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 104th season in Major 
League Baseball, their 29th season in San Francisco since their move from 
New York following the 1957 season, and their 27th at Candlestick Park. 
The team finished in third place in the National League West with an 83-79 
record, 13 games behind the Houston Astros. On August 20, 1986, Phillies 
pitcher Don Carman took a perfect game into the ninth inning against the 
Giants at Candlestick Park. Giants catcher Bob Brenly hit a long drive 
into the gap in left-center field. Phillies center fielder Milt Thompson 
was positioned to make a running catch but the ball hit the base of his 
glove and was ruled a hit.[10] Brenly was credited with a double. Carman 
lost the perfect game but the Phillies won in ten innings.[11] Infielders
