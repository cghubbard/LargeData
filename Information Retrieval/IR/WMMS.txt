WMMS (100.7 FM) – branded 100.7 WMMS: The Buzzard – is a commercial radio 
station licensed to Cleveland, Ohio, serving Greater Cleveland and much 
of surrounding Northeast Ohio. Widely regarded as one of the most influential 
rock stations in America throughout its history,[1][2][3][4] the station 
has also drawn controversy for unusually aggressive tactics both on and 
off the air.[5][6][7] Owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., and broadcasting a mix 
of active rock and hot talk, WMMS serves as the flagship station for Rover's 
Morning Glory, the Cleveland affiliate for The House of Hair with Dee Snider, 
and the home of radio personality Alan Cox. The station also serves as 
the FM flagship for the Cleveland Cavaliers and Cleveland Indians radio 
networks. Besides a standard analog transmission, WMMS broadcasts over 
two HD Radio channels, and is available online via iHeartRadio. The HD2 
digital subchannel, which airs alternative rock under the brand 99X, serves 
as the local affiliate for Sixx Sense with Nikki Sixx, and serves as the 
radio home of the Cleveland Monsters. WMMS-HD2 also simulcasts over Cleveland 
translator W256BT (99.1 FM). The WMMS studios are located at the former 
Centerior Energy building in the Cleveland suburb of Independence, while 
the station transmitter resides in neighboring Seven Hills. The WMMS call 
letters first referred to an owner – "MetroMedia Stereo" – but have since 
taken on a variety of other meanings. Created in April 1974 as "an ironic 
twist on Cleveland's down-and-out reputation as a decaying Rust Belt city," 
the station's longtime promotional mascot has been The Buzzard'.[8] In 
1981, Radio & Records identified "the malevolent feathered figure" as "the 
best-known station symbol in the country."[9] "De-emphasized" in the fall 
of 2007, the scavenger was revived the following spring to coincide with 
the station's 40th anniversary and with the arrival of morning personality 
Rover.[10][11] Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, WMMS had a stable of personalities 
that remained fundamentally unchanged,[1][4] attained a dominant market 
share in the local ratings[4][12][13][14] and posted market record-high 
figures "never duplicated by any other station."[4][13] WMMS played a key 
role in breaking several major acts in the U.S., including David Bowie, 
Rush, and Bruce Springsteen.[1] Station employees went on to take director 
and executive-level positions in the recording industry, namely with labels 
RCA, Mercury, and Columbia.[15][16] Considered "a true radio legend," WMMS 
DJ Kid Leo was chosen for Rolling Stone's "Heavy Hundred: The High and 
Mighty of the Music Industry" (1980) and named "The Best Disc Jockey in 
the Country" in a special 1987 issue of Playboy.[16][17] Noted filmmakers, 
including Cameron Crowe (Almost Famous) and Paul Schrader (Light of Day), 
have called on both The Buzzard and its personnel while preparing for various 
rock-themed productions.[18][19] WMMS was also a major driving force behind 
the successful campaign to bring the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to Cleveland.[1][20] 
Rolling Stone named WMMS "Best Radio Station" (Large Market) nine straight 
years (1979–87) as part of the magazine's annual Readers' Poll,[1] but 
the station admitted to stuffing the 1987 ballot following a February 1988 
front-page story in The Plain Dealer exposing manipulation.[21][22][23] 
Seven years later, members of the station's staff and management pleaded 
guilty to disrupting a national broadcast of The Howard Stern Show that 
originated via the local Stern affiliate, cross-town rival WNCX. A federal 
offense, the act nearly cost WMMS its broadcasting license.[24] On March 
30, 1946,[25] radio station WHK – owned at that time by United Broadcasting 
Company, a subsidiary of Forest City Publishing, itself the parent company 
of The Plain Dealer – launched an experimental FM station under the callsign 
W8XUB at 107.1 megahertz (MHz).[26] On July 31, 1947, W8XUB began broadcasting 
at 100.7 MHz.[27] On November 13, 1947, the new FM station transitioned 
from experimental to commercial status; increased its power; and changed 
its callsign to WHKX.[28] On November 11, 1948,[29] the station adopted 
the callsign WHK-FM. In 1958, both WHK and WHK-FM were sold to Metropolitan 
Broadcasting, itself renamed MetroMedia two years later.[26] Like most 
early FM stations, WHK-FM mostly simulcast the Top 40 programming of its 
AM sister station. In 1966, in an effort to make the medium more commercially 
viable, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandated that 
FM stations could no longer duplicate the programming of their AM sister 
stations.[26] Seeing a small but significant groundswell of support for 
the medium in the market, WHK-FM adopted a new progressive rock format 
on August 15, 1968. WHK-FM became one of a handful of commercial stations 
in the country to try that format, many of which were owned by MetroMedia.[26] 
In order to firmly establish a separate identity, and to reflect the station's 
ownership,[30] the WHK-FM callsign was changed to WMMS on September 28, 
1968.[31] MetroMedia found major success with progressive rock at KMET/Los 
Angeles, KSAN/San Francisco, WMMR/Philadelphia and WNEW-FM/New York, but 
low ratings and revenue in Cleveland led the company to drop the format 
at WMMS by May 1969. The station first turned to adult contemporary, then 
Top 40, big band and finally the Drake-Chenault automated Hit Parade '69.[32] 
WMMS reverted to progressive rock on September 11, 1970. Following a legal 
dispute with a competing station owner over non-compete clauses in their 
contracts, former WIXY personalities Dick "the Wilde Childe" Kemp and Lou 
"King" Kirby were signed by MetroMedia. The station briefly battled with 
WNCR of Nationwide Communications, itself filling the void created by the 
brief absence of WMMS on the rock scene. Key WNCR personnel (including 
former WHK-FM/WMMS personalities Martin Perlich and Billy Bass, and station 
newcomer David Spero) were soon hired by WMMS, taking most of their audience 
with them.[33][34] During this time, WMMS used slogans derived from its 
call sign: first as "Music Means Satisfaction", and later as the place 
"Where Music Means Something".[35] Under the leadership of station manager 
Billy Bass and program director Denny Sanders (who came to WMMS from Boston 
in 1971), WMMS helped break many new rock artists nationally, most notably 
David Bowie. Based on considerably high record sales in the Cleveland market, 
Bowie (in his Ziggy Stardust persona alongside The Spiders from Mars) kicked 
off his first U.S. tour in the "The Rock Capital" (a term coined by Bass).[36] 
The WMMS-sponsored concert was a "phenomenal success"[33][37] and prompted 
the station to sponsor a second show that year. This second show sold out 
immediately, and was held at the city's largest venue: Cleveland Public 
Hall.[37] In November 1972, WMMS was sold to Malrite Communications, a 
Michigan-based firm that relocated to Cleveland upon purchase. Under Malrite 
ownership, WMMS would become an album-oriented rock (AOR) powerhouse, much 
in the same vein as its former MetroMedia progressive rock siblings. During 
this time, WMMS also began broadcasting a remarkable amount of live concerts, 
many of which originated in Cleveland and were produced by the station 
itself. The WMMS Coffee Break Concert was a weekly music-interview show 
broadcast live from the station's studio, and later with an audience at 
the Agora Ballroom. Warren Zevon, John Mellencamp, Lou Reed, Tim Buckley, 
Peter Frampton, and a host of others performed on the program over the 
years, recordings of which are still widely available as bootlegs. The 
WMMS Coffee Break Concerts were booked by Denny Sanders and hosted by Len 
"Boom" Goldberg, and Debbie Ullman, later, Matt the Cat. The concert series 
continued on well into the 1990s and early 2000s, albeit much less frequently.[38][39] 
In July 1973, John Gorman joined WMMS as music director and was promoted 
to program director and operations manager two months later where he remained 
for thirteen years. During this time, with Denny Sanders as his creative 
services director and Rhonda Kiefer as programming assistant, WMMS broke 
all Cleveland ratings and revenue records. WMMS was the first radio station 
to employ full-time promotion and marketing directors: Dan Garfinkel and 
his successor, Jim Marchyshyn. In time, the station adopted new slogans 
reflecting the callsign: "We're your Modern Music Station" and "your Music 
Marathon Station."[40][41] Although never used on the air, listeners alternately 
knew the callsign as an acronym for "Weed Makes Me Smile" and "Magic MushroomS," 
the latter referencing the somewhat controversial logo used before the 
Buzzard.[35][42] WMMS also began referring to its frequency in promotions 
as "101 FM", a rounding-off which continued for the next decade. Contrary 
to what many believe, the choice of the second Malrite logo had nothing 
to do with Buzzard Day, the annual "folksy event" held in Hinckley Township, 
Ohio.[44] Rather, WMMS adopted a buzzard as its mascot in April 1974 because 
of the then tenuous economic state of Cleveland – less than five years 
away from becoming the first major American city to enter into default 
since the Great Depression[45] – and the winged-creature's classification 
as a scavenger. In other words, the carrion-eating bird represented "death 
and dying" – a darkly comic reflection of the city's decline. EC horror 
comics, Fritz the Cat, Rocky and Bullwinkle, and Looney Tunes – all served 
as inspirations for the "bird of prey with attitude" concept. The station 
was known as "The Home of the Buzzard" at first. The Buzzard was the co-creation 
of Gorman, Sanders and American Greetings artist David Helton.[8] We joked 
about the Buzzard becoming Cleveland's Mickey Mouse... a "Buzzard Land" 
amusement park filled with sex, drugs and rock and roll... A study conducted 
by MBA students at Case Western Reserve University in 1975 found that the 
new WMMS logo was more recognizable to those living in Greater Cleveland 
than both Chief Wahoo of the Cleveland Indians and even Coca-Cola.[43] 
From the onset, Helton's streamlined artwork resulted in an aggressive, 
yet family-friendly symbol for the station, one that continues to endure 
more than 40 years later. The Buzzard became synonymous with WMMS, Cleveland 
radio and the city itself, spawning a series of T-shirts so numerous that 
they are now impossible to catalog, many with slogans like "Where Music 
Means Something" and "Ruler of the Airwaves." A major contributor to the 
ratings success was an airstaff that remained fundamentally unchanged for 
many years: personalities like Kid Leo, Jeff & Flash, Matt the Cat, Dia 
Stein, Denny Sanders, Murray Saul, Debbie Ullman, Betty "Crash" Korvan, 
Ruby Cheeks (Debra Luray), BLF Bash (Bill Freeman), TR (Tom Renzy) and 
the late Len "Boom" Goldberg were invaluable to the station's popularity.[46] 
Of all the personalities that worked at WMMS, Len "Boom" Goldberg remained 
the longest. He joined the station in early 1972 before its sale to Malrite, 
and stayed in different capacities until 2004. He was best known as the 
voice for the station's hourly IDs, music segues, sweepers, and commercials, 
and was also a member of The Buzzard Morning Zoo in the mid-80s. "Born 
to Run" was the essence of everything I loved about rock 'n' roll. Bruce 
held on to the innocence and the romance. At the same time, the music communicates 
frustration and a constant longing to escape. WMMS during this period would 
play a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S., including: 
Rush, Roxy Music, Bruce Springsteen, Southside Johnny, Fleetwood Mac, Meat 
Loaf, the Pretenders, the New York Dolls, Lou Reed, Mott the Hoople, Boston, 
and Cheap Trick. Of special note was the early support of Bruce Springsteen 
by Kid Leo and others, prior to the release of the Born to Run album. For 
the station's tenth anniversary in 1978, WMMS hosted and broadcast a live 
Springsteen concert at the Agora Theatre and Ballroom independent of his 
concert tour. Heavily bootlegged, the concert further cemented the relationship 
between the two in fans' minds, and well into the 2000s Cleveland remains 
one of Springsteen's strongest bases. Right up until his departure in 1988, 
Kid Leo played "Born to Run" as his signature sign-off song every Friday 
night at 5:55 to kick off the weekend for area listeners.[1][15][16][47][48][49][50] 
The World Series of Rock was a recurring, day-long and usually multi-act 
summer rock concert held outdoors at Cleveland Municipal Stadium from 1974 
through 1980. Belkin Productions staged these events, attracting popular 
hard rock bands and as many as 88,000 fans. WMMS sponsored the concerts. 
Attendance was by general admission.[51] Concertgoers occasionally fell 
– or jumped – off the steep stadium upper deck onto the concrete seating 
area far below, causing serious injury. The Cleveland Free Clinic staffed 
aid stations in the stadium with physicians, nurses and other volunteers, 
and through 1977, made its treatment statistics public. From 1978 on, Belkin 
Productions conditioned its funding of the Free Clinic on the nondisclosure 
of the number of Clinic staff on duty at the concerts, the nature of conditions 
treated and the number of patients treated.[52][53] WMMS was directly influenced 
by then and current sister station WHTZ/New York (Z100), which rose to 
the top of the ratings books immediately after installing a contemporary 
hit radio (CHR) format. Among the more significant moves taken by WMMS 
was the formatting of the morning zoo concept created by Z100's Scott Shannon 
onto the show Jeff & Flash (Jeff Kinzbach and Ed Ferenc) were already hosting. 
Kinzbach and Ferenc had already been a morning team – with sidekicks – 
since 1976, seven years prior to adopting the "morning zoo" label, so the 
basic structure was already in place. The music structure also was modified 
at this time as artists such as Michael Jackson, Madonna and Prince soon 
found airplay on WMMS. The change was done for many reasons: as a nod to 
the sudden influence Z100's format had on the Malrite group; Gorman and 
Sanders intention to stay with the current music trends as the album-oriented 
rock (AOR) format was, even then, in a state of decline; and as a means 
to attract a female audience. By 1984, the WMMS format moved to an CHR/AOR 
hybrid, playing a great deal of Top 40 rock singles in hot rotation mixed 
with album cuts; this new blended rock/Top 40 format was soon known by 
those at the station as Rock Forty. The station also started to devote 
weekend programming to the classic rock format.[54] In the mid-1980s, WMMS 
was an important contributor in organizing a campaign (along with former 
Cleveland ad agency president Edward Spizel and author-deejay Norm N. Nite) 
which brought the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to Cleveland. John Gorman, 
Denny Sanders and Kid Leo organized the original campaign with Tunc Erim, 
assistant to Atlantic Records president Ahmet Ertegun. Jeff & Flash were 
also credited as being major contributors in bringing the Rock Hall to 
Cleveland, by heavily promoting on-air a USA Today reader poll to decide 
which city should get it.[55] John Gorman and Denny Sanders left the station 
in fall of 1986, leading fourteen staff members with them to start rival 
station WNCX. Gorman credits his decision to leave to changes in management, 
and the station's overall shift to a more "corporate" mentality. Rolling 
Stone named WMMS "Radio Station of the Year" nine straight years (1979–87) 
as part of its annual Readers' Poll, but a February 1988 front-page story 
in The Plain Dealer revealed station employees had stuffed the annual survey's 
ballot box for the 1987 poll to allow for the possibility of a tenth straight 
win the following year. Lonnie Gronek, then general manager of the station, 
claimed in The Plain Dealer article that the process had gone on "for years", 
however other accounts dispute Gronek's claim. The station claimed it was 
simply "a marketing strategy" and "much in line with what many stations 
did."[56] Negative reaction was swift and widespread;[21][22] some called 
the scheme a mere "lack of judgement,"[21] while a reporter for the Akron 
Beacon Journal compared the station's response to that of discredited former 
Vice-President Spiro Agnew.[57] By the late 1980s, most of the original 
staff members had departed: John Gorman and Denny Sanders left in 1986 
to launch upstart station WNCX, and Columbia Records hired Kid Leo in 1988.[58] 
Four different program directors, including Rich Piombino and Michael Luczak, 
came and went with varying levels of success. DJ additions included station 
engineer Ric Bennett as "Rocco the Rock Dog,"[59] Scooter (WMMS music director 
Brad Hanson), former WRQC nighttime Personality and later WNCX Afternoon 
Drive and Production Director, Tom "Jack" Daniels (who returned to the 
Cleveland airwaves after a successful stint as Program Director of WLEV, 
Allentown, PA), Lisa Dillon[59] and station veteran Matt the Cat,[59] (who 
returned to the midday slot in 1990 after a two-year absence.) However, 
Matt would be dismissed permanently from the station in late 1992, the 
victim of budget cuts. Ratings steadily increased during the time of the 
First Gulf War, but The Howard Stern Show was soon picked up by a then 
struggling WNCX. Stern's ratings exploded and this – along with a growing 
urgency from management not to compete with or mention Stern on the air 
– led to a sudden and steep ratings decline for The Buzzard Morning Zoo. 
Matt the Cat was permanently let go in December 1992 due to "budget problems."[59] 
From 1991 to 1993, WMMS served as the FM flagship for the Cleveland Browns, 
sharing coverage with then-sister WHK; the late Nev Chandler served as 
play-by-play announcer.[60] Unable to service its growing debt, Malrite 
chose to leave radio and sold off all its remaining properties in 1993:[14] 
WMMS went to Shamrock Broadcasting, the Roy Disney broadcasting firm.[61] 
Management ordered a change to the Buzzard by giving it a flat-top and 
mullet. The station continued to decline during the ownership transition 
from Malrite to Shamrock; then Shamrock sold both WMMS and WHK to OmniAmerica, 
a broadcasting company run by former Malrite executives Carl Hirsch and 
Dean Thacker, which already owned oldies station WMJI. WMMS' decline culminated 
on April 14, 1994 with the high-profile departure of Jeff Kinzbach, effectively 
ending "Jeff & Flash" on WMMS (Ferenc would leave the station several weeks 
later; both would pair up again at WWWE).[56] Lisa Dillon, Ric Bennett 
and Tom Renzy also would depart the station that same day.[26] Among the 
most notorious broadcasts of The Howard Stern Show occurred on June 10, 
1994.[62] Stern had arrived on the Cleveland airwaves less than two years 
earlier, and in that time took his syndicated program on rival WNCX from 
an Arbitron ranking of thirteen to number one.[63] As promised, Stern held 
a party for his fans on the streets of Cleveland – a "Funeral" for his 
local rivals, much like similar events held in New York, Los Angeles and 
Philadelphia – and broadcast it nationwide.[62][64] During the now infamous 
broadcast, WMMS engineer William Alford snipped a broadcast wire used for 
the Stern show's satellite feed.[24][65] Stern continued on with the program 
over a phone line as engineers worked to quickly patch together the severed 
broadcast wire. Alford was subsequently caught, arrested and later sentenced 
to ten days in jail and a $1,000 fine.[66] Station management initially 
claimed that Alford acted alone,[65] however WMMS Promotions Director Heidi 
Klosterman – working under the name Heidi Kramer – later pleaded guilty 
to a felony charge of attempted disruption of a public service and a misdemeanor 
of receiving stolen property; Greg Smith, a former Klosterman colleague, 
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of breaking and entering.[67] Already program 
director at OmniAmerica station WMJI, station veteran John Gorman returned 
to WMMS as vice-president and director of operations in early 1994.[68] 
Gorman changed the WMMS format to alternative rock,[69] playing new acts 
like Nirvana, The Offspring, and Nine Inch Nails, on October 27.[69][70][71][72] 
To emphasize this change, WMMS was re-branded and aggressively promoted 
as "Buzzard Radio: The Next Generation", a reference to the success of 
Star Trek: The Next Generation and its continuation of the Star Trek franchise.[70][73] 
Gorman brought back the original Buzzard design, now drawn by David Helton's 
successor Brian Chalmers.[18] WMMS also lured popular morning personalities 
Brian Fowler and Joe Cronauer away from rival WENZ – then an alternative 
rock station known as 107.9 The END – as the successors to Jeff and Flash 
(Jeff Kinzbach, Ed Ferenc) on The Buzzard Morning Zoo.[74] While the change 
in programming alienated many longtime listeners – many of whom switched 
to WNCX and their full-time classic rock format – WMMS boosted its ratings 
for the first time in years with a new, younger audience.[68][70] Billboard 
and Airplay Monitor magazines together named WMMS Rock Station of the Year 
(Medium Market) in 1995,[75] and Modern Rock Station of the Year (Medium 
Market) in 1996.[76] John Gorman was named Program Director of the Year 
(Rock) in 1995.[75] Despite signs of success, the station was sold again 
in 1996. WMMS went to Nationwide Communications; longtime sister station 
WHK went to Salem Communications – the first time the two had ever operated 
under separate ownership.[70][77][78] The sale came almost immediately 
after passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a time when radio 
companies nationwide rushed "at a fever pitch" to acquire new properties.[77] 
John Gorman – who has since openly criticized the industry's current state 
– departed for CBS Radio in Detroit, but soon moved to media consulting.[79][80][81][82] 
During this time, WMMS held a series of sold-out rock festivals that featured 
many of the new up-and-coming artists receiving station airplay. Buzzard-Palooza 
was the first of these: held in July 1994 at the Nautica Stage, the all-day 
concert included sets from Collective Soul, Junkhouse and Fury in the Slaughterhouse,[83] 
but was cut short after turning into a "rock-and-bottle-throwing melee." 
Cleveland Police wearing riot gear were called in just as headliner Green 
Day took the stage.[84] WMMS scheduled a second Green Day performance just 
two months later – this time at Blossom Music Center – and at a near-record-low 
cost of $5 per ticket, the station gave fans a "second chance" to see the 
band live.[85] The Ramones headlined BuzzardFest '95 the following spring 
(May 1995) at Blossom;[86] other acts included Our Lady Peace, The Rugburns 
and Face to Face.[86] BuzzardFest II was held the very next fall (September 
1995) – again at Blossom – and featured performances from the Goo Goo Dolls, 
Alanis Morissette, Jewel, as well as the Dance Hall Crashers, Eleven, Green 
Apple Quick Step, Prick and Sons of Elvis.[87][88] The next of these multi-act 
shows – simply titled BuzzardFest – was held in May 1996 at Blossom Music 
Center and featured performances from 311 and No Doubt, along with Candlebox, 
The Nixons, Goldfinger, Gods Child, Dash Rip Rock and the Holy Barbarians.[89] 
BuzzardFest 2000 was held June 30, 2000 at the Nautica Stage.[90] Stone 
Temple Pilots, performing in Cleveland for the first time in six years, 
headlined the event.[90] WMMS would shift to active rock on February 17, 
1997.[91] The station's ownership would change yet again, as Nationwide 
Communications was bought out by Jacor Communications in 1998.[92] Following 
Jacor's takeover, WMMS ran a "Death of the Buzzard" month-long stunt in 
October 1998.[93] Geared as a format change to Contemporary Hit Radio (CHR) 
as KISS 100.7,[7][94] the decision was reversed last-minute by management,[12] 
though the "KISS" brand and format did later end up on WMMS sister station 
WAKS.[95] In the wake of the month-long stunt, a new airstaff was assembled. 
Most notably, Slats (Tim Guinane) was hired for afternoon-drive replacing 
Brian & Joe, who took the morning slot on sister station WMVX, and music 
director Mark Pennington replaced "BLF Bash" (Bill Freeman) during overnights. 
Seth the Barbarian (Seth Williams) took the overnight shift when Pennington 
moved to evenings in 2001.[96] Less than a year later, Jacor was absorbed 
by media giant Clear Channel Communications (now current owner iHeartMedia): 
the May 1999 sale continued the buying frenzy brought on by controversial 
and far-reaching federal deregulation. Bo Matthews (Alex Gutierrez), who 
became program director for WMMS in early 2004, hired Maxwell (Benjamin 
Bornstein) that April for a more "personality-driven" afternoon show: The 
Maxwell Show gradually evolved from airing mostly music to all talk, and 
by 2009 had become the number one afternoon program in several key demographics.[97] 
Loveline – Westwood One's nationally syndicated call-in show hosted by 
Dr. Drew – aired weeknights from August 2008 through June 2010.[98] WMMS 
veteran John Gorman has remained a vocal critic of iHeartMedia; Gorman 
commented on the company's former Cleveland executive, Kevin Metheny (the 
man dubbed "Pig Virus" by Howard Stern during their time at WNBC): "He 
had a volatile time here. People in radio say he was not an easy guy, that 
dealing with him was like a daily root canal."[82] In September 2007, WMMS 
management chose to "de-emphasize" both the Buzzard and WMMS call letters, 
referring to the station as simply "100.7", save for the FCC-mandated legal 
ID at the top of every hour.[10] Regarding the change, WMMS program director 
Bo Matthews (Alex Gutierrez) said, "… nobody's killing anything... Chief 
Wahoo is not on every piece of Indians promotional material... Ronald McDonald 
is not in every McDonald's commercial... We're not losing the letters. 
All we're doing is shifting an image."[10] By April 2008, the station had 
reverted to its traditional branding, once again frequently making use 
of both the noted mascot and famed call letters. The current WMMS logo 
displays orange wings on the sides of a weathered black road sign similar 
to a U.S. Route shield, with white print reading "100.7 WMMS",[11] while 
the Buzzard is also again prominently featured - being used in recent years 
to help promote the station's sports coverage via WMMS' status as the FM 
flagship station for the Indians and Cavaliers. WMMS served as the FM flagship 
for the Cleveland Browns for a second time from 2002 to 2012, sharing coverage 
with AM sister WTAM. Games were covered on-site by play-by-play announcer 
Jim Donovan, sports director for WKYC; and color commentator Doug Dieken, 
a former Browns offensive tackle. Play-by-play coverage did not stream 
online due to league restrictions.[99][100] Comedian Chad Zumock was co-host 
of The Alan Cox Show from early 2010 to late 2012; on December 3, 2012, 
it was announced that he was no longer with WMMS after being arrested for 
driving while intoxicated.[101] However, on May 3, 2013, Cleveland Scene 
reported that Zumock had been acquitted of the charge.[102] Radio & Records 
twice named WMMS "Rock Station of the Year: Markets 1-25" (2005–06) as 
part of the now defunct publication's annual Industry Achievement Awards.[103][104] 
From the 1994 exit of Jeff & Flash (Jeff Kinzbach, Ed Ferenc) – themselves 
enjoying a run of nearly twenty years – until the arrival of Rover (Shane 
French) in 2008, WMMS was beset by a roster of thirteen different morning 
shows in as many years. Ross Brittain temporarily filled in prior to the 
arrival of Brian and Joe (Brian Fowler, Joe Cronauer). Brian and Joe were 
moved to afternoons in February 1997 after a change in ownership; the station 
then turned to shock jock Liz Wilde (Anne Whittemore) from WPLL/Miami. 
Her firing less than a year later sparked a successful lawsuit against 
both the station and then-owner Nationwide Communications. Danny Czekalinski 
and Darla Jaye teamed up in October 1997 with Liz Wilde holdover Cory Lingus 
(Cory Gallant) until August 1998. Matt Harris served in the interim until 
WMMS hired Dick Dale (Bert Morris) from WPLA/Jacksonville.[105][106] In 
2000, the station turned to Wakin' up with Wolf and Mulrooney (Bob Wolf, 
John Mulrooney) from sister station WPYX/Albany. The show was simulcast 
from Albany, marking the first time that a morning show on WMMS did not 
originate in Cleveland. The team did later relocate to Cleveland, but lasted 
only a few months until an acrimonious breakup forced the station to look 
elsewhere. Other shows, like The Buzzard Morning Show with Rick and Megalis 
(Rick Eberhart, Tom Megalis) and WMMS Mornings with Sean, Cristi, and Hunter 
(Sean Kelly, Cristi Cantle, Hunter Scott), came and went in quick succession. 
The Bob and Tom Show aired from 2006 through early 2008, the only time 
since adopting a rock format that WMMS carried a syndicated program in 
that time slot with no connection to the station throughout the duration 
of its run.[105][107] Ohio native Maxwell (Benjamin Bornstein) was hired 
on for the WMMS afternoon drive in April 2004 following the departure of 
Slats (Tim Guinane) for rival station WXTM.[108] An experienced on air 
personality,[109] Maxwell was joined by WMMS music director Dan Stansbury 
and Chunk (Tiffany Peck), a young phone screener whose role grew significantly 
during the course of the show's run. The Maxwell Show began as a mostly 
a kind-of rock/talk hybrid, but gradually became all talk. Maxwell was 
known for having feuds with other radio personalities during the show's 
time at WMMS, including fellow WMMS personality Rover of Rover's Morning 
Glory and fellow Clear Channel host Mike Trivisonno, airing directly opposite 
The Maxwell Show on WTAM. On April 3, 2009, The Maxwell Show went on the 
air claiming that Metallica – in Cleveland for the 2009 Rock and Roll Hall 
of Fame induction ceremony the very next day – was playing a free show 
in the WMMS parking lot later that evening. Following the prank announcement, 
station management placed Maxwell on probation for 90 days. Already strained 
by ongoing contract renewal negotiations, the incident further alienated 
the two parties, and by November of that year the show was cancelled.[97] 
Hot talk accounts for all programming during weekday drive times, and the 
station serves as the FM flagship for the Cleveland Cavaliers and Cleveland 
Indians radio networks. However, WMMS continues to air rock music during 
middays, nights, and overnights; during nearly all weekend shifts; nearly 
continuously on the HD2 digital subchannel; and online during Cavaliers 
and Indians play-by-play. Cleveland Magazine describes the morning and 
afternoon drive programs as "talks shows with a younger, rock-oriented 
sensibility", and readers of Cleveland Scene named WMMS the best Cleveland 
radio station for music in 2009 (Scene readers also named WMMS the best 
station overall in 2010 and 2012).[110][111][112][113] WMMS airs regular 
traffic and weather updates via the Total Traffic and Weather Network and 
former sister station WOIO (TV channel 19), and the station satisfies U.S. 
Federal Communications Commission-mandated public affairs programming on 
Sunday mornings with the City Club of Cleveland's Friday Forum. Most station 
imaging is produced out-of-market by national voice talents "David Lee" 
Olejniczak, Malcolm Ryker, Rena-Marie Villano, and former WMMS creative 
services director Miles Hlivko; additional voice-over audio is produced 
on-site by WMMS imaging director Billy Black. WMMS also transmits text 
to compatible analog receivers, such as station IDs and artist and song 
information, via the Radio Data System (RDS); similarly, WMMS transmits 
text to HD Radio receivers known as Program Service Data (PSD). On January 
29, 2014, "Chris Tyler" Merluzzo was named the new WMMS program director. 
Formerly program director for WHJY/Providence, Chris Tyler began in Cleveland 
on February 17, 2014.[114][115][116][117][118] This radio station is known 
for breaking the rules, changing the game, and being successful. We all 
have such respect for what this station did back in the day. That will 
never be done again. All we can do is hope to create something cool so 
that in 20 years people will say, "Man, remember what WMMS used to be like? 
It really was an awesome time." Radio personality Rover (Shane French), 
host of Rover's Morning Glory, took over weekday mornings at WMMS on April 
1, 2008 following a contract dispute with cross-town rock rival WKRK-FM; 
former WMMS program director John Gorman compared signing the popular morning 
personality to a "coup". Born in Chicago but raised in Las Vegas, Rover 
worked for rock stations KISW/Seattle and KXPK/Denver prior to arriving 
in the Cleveland radio market; the morning host also served as the Midwest 
replacement for Howard Stern following the latter's move to Sirius Satellite 
Radio in 2006. Co-hosts Duji (Susan Catanese) and Dominic Dieter each worked 
on Rover's Morning Glory before the move to WMMS; since then, the show 
has expanded to include sound engineer Chocolate Charlie (Mike Toomey), 
phone screener Nadz (Jeffrey Hadzinsky), show producer Scott Taylor, and 
former intern Jeffrey LaRocque. Past show members at WMMS include Dumb 
(Shaun Street) and Rob Garguilo. Past affiliates at WMMS include WAMX/Huntington, 
WMFS/Memphis, WNDE/Indianapolis, WXEG/Dayton, WRXS/Columbus, and the now 
defunct Extreme Talk. The show is now syndicated to WKGB-FM/Binghamton, 
WRKK/Williamsport, and WZNE/Rochester; replays continuously on a dedicated 
iHeartRadio channel; is available on demand through iHeartRadio; and broadcasts 
over the Livestream video platform. WMMS itself also airs The Rover Rewind, 
a weekly recap show on Saturday mornings. Rover is under contract with 
WMMS through 2017.[120][121][122][123][124] Described by The Plain Dealer 
as "testosterone-fueled", the show dominates younger demographics, particularly 
male listeners ages 18–34. Cleveland Magazine has called the show a "juggernaut", 
and readers of Cleveland Scene named Rover the best Cleveland radio personality 
in 2009, 2014, and 2015 (Scene had previously recognized either Rover or 
his show four straight years, from 2004 to 2007, all prior to the move 
to WMMS). The broadcast consists entirely of talk, a mix of current events, 
pop culture, and stories from the staff. Regular segments include "The 
Shizzy", a daily news update; "Tech Tuesday", where listeners pose consumer 
electronics questions to an industry expert; and "The Thursday Hook-Up", 
a call-in dating game. Rover regularly takes calls throughout the show, 
and often interviews guests in studio and over the phone. Cleveland Police 
briefly detained Ky-Mani Marley after the singer threatened Rover for comments 
made during an April 20, 2010 in-studio interview. On October 26, 2010, 
Rover hired a witch doctor to curse LeBron James after the NBA star left 
the Cleveland Cavaliers.[110][112][120][125] Radio personality Alan Cox, 
formerly host of The Morning Fix at WKQX/Chicago and The Alan Cox Radio 
Show at WXDX-FM/Pittsburgh, took over weekday afternoons as host of The 
Alan Cox Show on December 16, 2009. Joining the Chicago native are: Erika 
Lauren Wasilewski, a cast member on The Real World: D.C.; Bill Squire, 
a Cleveland area comedian who replaced former co-host Chad Zumock following 
the latter's exit in 2012; and former intern Poundcake (Cody Brown). Described 
by Talkers magazine as "a bold anomaly worthy of industry attention", the 
show itself has successfully continued the format established by its predecessor 
The Maxwell Show – all talk during afternoon drive on an FM rock station. 
The Alan Cox Show is rated #1 in several key demographics, and readers 
of Cleveland Scene named Alan Cox the best Cleveland radio personality 
four straight years (2010–13). In addition to the live broadcast, the show 
is available on demand through iHeartRadio; and can be downloaded as a 
podcast through iTunes. WMMS also airs The Week in Cox, a weekly recap 
show on Sunday mornings. Alan Cox is under contract with WMMS through 2016.[110][124][126][127][128][129][130] 
A devoted fan of heavy metal, Cox considers himself more of a comedian 
than a disc jockey. The show itself rapidly covers a range of topics in 
a comedic format, from major current events to obscure pop culture; regular 
segments like "Sperm News", "Why Florida Sucks", and "Are You Smarter Than 
a Dumbass?" typify the show's irreverent style. Cox also frequently takes 
calls from listeners, and often interviews guests in studio and over the 
phone. During a June 19, 2012 interview with Aerosmith frontman Steven 
Tyler, the show broke news of the delayed release for Music from Another 
Dimension!, the band's first studio album in eight years. On February 9, 
2010, the show aired "Parma State of Mind", both a parody of the Jay-Z/Alicia 
Keys hit "Empire State of Mind" and a way of continuing the Northeast Ohio 
tradition of poking fun at the Cleveland suburb. Dean DePiero, then mayor 
of Parma, criticized the song and its accompanying YouTube video: "It's 
pretty sick. ... The people who put it together aren't even smart enough 
to know where our city boundaries are." The show also drew national attention 
after holding a book burning party for Fifty Shades of Grey on July 8, 
2012.[127][131][132][133] Active rock accounts for nearly all other regular 
programming. WMMS personality Maria Calo hosts the midday music shift, 
including: "Under the Covers", a daily segment devoted to cover songs; 
and "Big Hair Wednesday", a weekly segment devoted to hair metal. WMMS 
personality "Corey Rotic" Hawkins hosts both the weeknight music shift 
and The Rock Report, a daily rock news update. Content for the weekday 
overnight shift, including music and on-air talent, comes from the iHeartMedia 
active rock national format via the Premium Choice network. On weekends, 
Maria and Corey Rotic each host music shifts. On Saturday nights, Corey 
also hosts The Saturday Sanitarium, a local block of Metallica. On Sunday 
nights, Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider hosts The House of Hair with 
Dee Snider, a mix of heavy metal, glam metal, and hard rock via United 
Stations Radio Networks. Other weekend content arrives via Premium Choice.[134][135][136] 
Alternative rock accounts for nearly all regular programming on the HD2 
digital subchannel. Branded 99X, WMMS-HD2 also simulcasts over Cleveland 
translator W256BT (99.1 FM). On-site, WMMS program director Chris Tyler 
oversees HD2 programming, while Alan Cox Show co-host Erika Lauren produces 
HD2 imaging; additional imaging and voice-over audio is produced out-of-market 
by former WMMS creative services director Miles Hlivko. Erika Lauren also 
hosts a local music shift weekday mornings. The majority of other 99X content, 
including music and on-air talent, comes from the iHeartMedia alternative 
rock national format via the Premium Choice network. In addition, Mötley 
Crüe co-founder Nikki Sixx and radio personality Jenn Marino host Sixx 
Sense with Nikki Sixx, a weeknight mix of talk and alternative rock via 
Premiere Networks. On Sunday nights, Sixx and Marino host The Side Show 
Countdown with Nikki Sixx, a late night weekend companion to Sixx Sense.[137][138] 
WMMS has served as the FM flagship station for the Cleveland Cavaliers 
Radio Network since 2014, sharing network flagship status with AM sister 
station WTAM. Play-by-play announcer John Michael and color analyst Jim 
Chones, a former Cavaliers center, cover games on-site. In studio, WTAM 
sports director Mike Snyder hosts The Tip-Off Show, The Halftime Report, 
and The Postgame Call-In Show – the network pregame, halftime, and postgame 
shows, respectively. WMMS does not air The Cavaliers Insider Show, a weekly 
season-long network show. Play-by-play itself is also limited to over-the-air 
FM; due to league restrictions, the WMMS online feed does not stream in-game 
coverage.[139][140][141][142] WMMS has also served as the FM flagship station 
for the Cleveland Indians Radio Network since 2013, again sharing network 
flagship status with AM sister station WTAM. Play-by-play announcers Tom 
Hamilton and Jim Rosenhaus call the games on-site. WMMS also airs Indians 
Warm-Up, the network pregame show; and Indians Wrap-Up, the network postgame 
show. WMMS does not air weekday day games or Tribe Talk, a weekly year-round 
network show, and the station only airs select games during spring training. 
Automated music airs during games on the station's webstream due to MLB 
rules reserving those rights to only paid customers of the MLB's streaming 
options, including MLB.tv and the At Bat app.[111][143][144][145][146] 
WMMS-HD2 (99X) serves as the exclusive radio outlet for Cleveland Monsters 
hockey games during the 2016–17 AHL season. Play-by-play announcer Tony
