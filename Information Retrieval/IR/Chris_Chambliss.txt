As player As coach Carroll Christopher Chambliss (born December 26, 1948) 
is an American professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major 
League Baseball from 1971 to 1988 for the Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees 
and Atlanta Braves. He served as a coach for the Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, 
New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds, and Seattle Mariners. Chambliss won the 
American League Rookie of the Year Award with the Indians in 1971. He was 
an All-Star with the Yankees in 1976, the same year he hit the series-winning 
home run in the 1976 American League Championship Series. He was a member 
of the Yankees' 1977 and 1978 World Series championship teams, both against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers, and won the Gold Glove Award in 1978. Chambliss 
went on to win four more World Series championships as the hitting coach 
for the Yankees in 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2000. Chambliss was born in Dayton, 
Ohio, on December 26, 1948. He was the third of four sons born to Carroll 
and Christine Chambliss. His father was a chaplain in the United States 
Navy, leading the family to relocate many times during Chris' childhood. 
They settled in Oceanside, California, where Chris attended high school.[1] 
Chris and his brothers all played baseball on the Oceanside High School 
baseball team.[2] Chambliss enrolled at MiraCosta College, a junior college, 
where he played college baseball. Despite being selected in the Major League 
Baseball (MLB) Drafts of 1967 and 1968 by the Cincinnati Reds, he opted 
not to sign with the Reds on either occasion. He transferred to the University 
of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he continued his college baseball 
career with the UCLA Bruins baseball team in 1969. That season, he led 
the Bruins with 15 home runs and 45 runs batted in. During the summer, 
he played collegiate summer baseball for the Anchorage Glacier Pilots of 
the Alaska Baseball League, which won the National Baseball Congress (NBC) 
championship. Chambliss had a .583 batting average in the NBC tournament 
and was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player.[1] The Cleveland Indians 
selected Chambliss with the first overall pick in the January 1970 Major 
League Baseball Draft.[1] The Indians assigned him to the Wichita Aeros 
of the Class AAA American Association, their most advanced minor league 
baseball affiliate. With the Aeros, Chambliss batted .342, which led the 
league.[1] With Ken Harrelson serving as the Indians' first baseman, the 
Indians had Chambliss play in the outfield for Wichita in 1971, in order 
to have both players in their lineup at the same time.[1] He debuted in 
the majors in 1971, and was named AL Rookie of the Year. Chambliss played 
first base and was known as a great clutch hitter throughout his career. 
Chambliss was traded to the New York Yankees from the Indians in April 
1974, along with pitchers Cecil Upshaw and Dick Tidrow for Fritz Peterson, 
Fred Beene, Tom Buskey, and Steve Kline.[3] Chris Chambliss was once quoted 
as saying, "If you're not having fun [in baseball], you miss the point 
of everything."[4] Chambliss appeared in the 1976 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game.[5] In the 1976 American League Championship Series against 
the Kansas City Royals, Chambliss hit the game-winning home run off Mark 
Littell in the deciding Game 5.[6] Chambliss was the hitting star of the 
1976 ALCS, as he also hit a two-run homer in Game 3 to help the Yankees 
win that Game 5 to 3. He hit an ALCS record .524 with 2 home runs and eight 
RBIs. In the 1976 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds, Chambliss hit 
.313 (5-for-16) with one RBI. Chambliss played three more seasons with 
the Yankees, winning a Gold Glove for fielding prowess in 1978. Immediately 
after the walk-off home run, thousands of fans stormed the Yankee Stadium 
field to celebrate. Chambliss was mobbed on the basepaths and did not make 
an attempt to touch home plate. Instead, he ran straight toward the dugout 
and the safety of the Yankee clubhouse. Chambliss was then asked by Graig 
Nettles if he had touched home, and responded that he had not because too 
many people were in the way. Nettles then told him that home plate umpire 
Art Frantz was waiting for him to touch home so that the home run could 
be ruled official. He was then escorted back out onto the field to touch 
home, but the plate had been stolen, so he touched the area where the plate 
had been. Kansas City manager Whitey Herzog could have appealed the play, 
as Major League rules state that a player must touch all bases on any hit 
or when running the bases. However, the mayhem on the field made this task 
impossible, and given the magnitude of the game, Herzog would have never 
tried to have it restarted or protested due to a technicality. As a result 
of this incident, Major League Baseball changed the rules to allow the 
umpire to award any base a runner or the batter cannot reach due to fans 
rushing the field.[7] After the 1979 season, the Yankees traded Chambliss 
to the Toronto Blue Jays with Damaso Garcia and Paul Mirabella for Rick 
Cerone, Tom Underwood, and Ted Wilborn. The Yankees hoped that Cerone would 
replace Thurman Munson as their starting catcher.[8] Later that offseason, 
the Blue Jays traded Chambliss with Luis Gómez to the Atlanta Braves for 
prospects Barry Bonnell, Joey McLaughlin, and Pat Rockett.[9] He then moved 
on to Atlanta from 1980 through 1986. He had one at-bat with the Yankees 
in 1988 and struck out. He retired with a career .279 batting average and 
185 home runs.[10] After his playing days ended, Chambliss became a hitting 
instructor for several teams and was talked about as a possible managerial 
candidate. In 1989, Chambliss became the manager for the Double-A London 
Tigers of the Eastern League, an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. The London 
Tigers won the Eastern League title in 1990, playing out of Labatt Park. 
That same year Chambliss was named Minor League Manager of the Year by 
The Sporting News. Chambliss was also a hitting coach with the Yankees, 
and has the distinction of being one of two men who wore a Yankees uniform 
(player or coach) during each of the Yankees' last six World Series Championship 
seasons prior to 2009 (1977, 1978, 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2000)—the other 
is former New York Mets manager Willie Randolph. Chambliss was also the 
hitting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals,[11] New York Mets[12] and Cincinnati 
Reds.[13] Chambliss was the manager of the Triple A Charlotte Knights prior 
to joining the Seattle Mariners in November, 2010 as hitting coach.[14] 
At the conclusion of the 2012 season, the Mariners announced that Chambliss 
would not be returning as their hitting coach in 2013.[15] Chambliss' cousin
