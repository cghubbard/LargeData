Wallingford is a town in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. 
The population was 45,135 at the 2010 census.[2][3] On October 10, 1667 
the Connecticut General Assembly authorized the “making of a village on 
the east river” to 38 planters and freemen. The “long highway” located 
on the ridge of the hill above the sandy plain along the Quinnipiac River 
is the present Main Street in Wallingford. On May 12, 1670 the bounds were 
set in the settlement and about 126 people settled in the Town in temporary 
housing. Six-acre lots were set out and by the year 1675, 40 houses stretched 
along the street. [4] In 1697 Wallingford was the site of the last witchcraft 
trial in New England. Winifred Benham was thrice tried for witchcraft and 
acquitted all three times. [5] During the nineteenth century, Wallingford 
industry expanded with a considerable concentration of small pewter and 
Britannia ware manufacturers. By mid-century, Robert Wallace acquired the 
formula for nickel silver and established with Samuel Simpson, R. Wallace 
& Company the forerunner of Wallace Silversmiths. It was also during this 
period that many of the small silver and Britannia plants were combined 
to form the International Silver Company with its headquarters in Meriden 
and several plants in Wallingford.[4] Wallingford has diversified its commercial 
and industrial base over the past decade attracting high-technology industries 
as compared to traditional heavy manufacturing. It is the home of a large 
variety of industries and major corporations spanning the spectrum of the 
medical, health care, service, high-tech specialty metal manufacturing 
and research development. The development of the Barnes Industrial Park, 
Casimir Pulaski Industrial Park, Wharton Brook Industrial Park, and the 
South Turnpike Road area have greatly contributed to this transition. The 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, the town’s largest taxpayer, has established 
a research and development facility in Wallingford’s MedWay Industrial 
Park. An Interchange Zone which permits very restrictive commercial development 
of office parks, research and development centers and hotels has been created 
at the intersection of Interstate 91 and Route 68. [4] In terms of Wallingford's 
manufacturing and design history, silver-producing companies like Simpson, 
Hall, Miller & Co. and R. Wallace & Sons are of particular note. Simpson, 
Hall, Miller & Co. as well as Wallingford's Watrous Manufacturing later 
became part of the International Silver Company, which was headquartered 
in the neighboring city of Meriden.[6][7] The town of Wallingford has both 
public and private education. The Wallingford Public School System consists 
of eight elementary schools, two middle schools, and two high schools. 
Wallingford has a private sector of schools offering the following: Choate 
Rosemary Hall, Heritage Baptist Academy, and Holy Trinity School.[8][9][10][11]
