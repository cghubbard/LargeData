Weston is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut. The population was 10,179 
at the 2010 census.[1] The town is served by Route 57 and Route 53, both 
of which run through the town center. About 19% of the town's workforce 
commutes to New York City, about 45 miles (72 km) to the southwest.[2] 
Like many towns in southwestern Connecticut, Weston is among the most affluent 
communities in the United States. Data collected in 2011 showed that Weston 
had the highest median household income in Fairfield County, Connecticut, 
at US$205,173.[3] In 2011 Connecticut Magazine named Weston as the number 
one town in Connecticut among towns with populations of 10,000–15,000. 
The rating considers education, crime, economy, cost and leisure. Weston 
is bordered by Wilton to the west, Redding to the north, Easton to the 
east, Fairfield to the southeast, and Westport to the south. Aside from 
a handful of stores that form the town’s center, Weston has little commercial 
development. Residential development is limited by two-acre zoning.[4] 
Most of Devil's Den Preserve, a 1,746-acre (707 ha) nature reserve, which 
gets 40,000 visits a year, is located in the town. In the 17th century, 
Weston's first English settlers were mostly farmers living in the town 
of Fairfield, Connecticut, the boundaries of which extended to Weston until 
the late 18th century. The Norfield Parish was created in the area now 
occupied by the towns of Weston and Easton. In 1787, the area was formally 
incorporated as the Town of Weston. In 1845, the Town of Easton was split 
off from Weston. A meteor exploded above the town December 14, 1807.[5] 
Six pieces, totaling 28 pounds (13 kg), were recovered and examined by 
scientists, who issued a report. This was the first time that people realized 
the nature of meteors.[6][7] Despite rocky soil, farmers in town grew apples, 
onions, and potatoes. Grist, cider, lumber, and fulling mills were built. 
The town had nine manufacturers by 1850, but two decades later only the 
Bradley Edge Tool Company still thrived. That factory burned down in 1911.[8] 
Unlike other nearby towns, Weston never had a railroad built through it, 
which stifled the development of non-agricultural businesses. Between the 
Civil War and the Great Depression, the town's population dropped from 
approximately 1,000 to a low of 670, by 1930. Artists, writers, and actors 
from New York became attracted to the community in the 1930s and began 
settling in it. Construction of the Merritt Parkway, which arrived to the 
south of Weston in 1938, resulted in further population growth.[8] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 20.7 square 
miles (54 km2), of which 19.8 square miles (51 km2) is land and 0.9 square 
miles (2.3 km2), or 4.39%, is water. The Saugatuck River begins to the 
north in Redding. It flows through the town and ends in Long Island Sound 
in neighboring Westport. Weston is bordered by Westport to the south, Wilton 
to the west, Redding to the north, Easton to the east, and Fairfield to 
the southeast. Other minor communities and geographic areas are Devil's 
Den, Norfield, Upper Parish, and Valley Forge. As of the census[11] of

England towns, the government of Weston consists of the Town Meeting, and 
elective and appointive boards. First among the elective boards is the 
Board of Selectmen. Nina Daniel is the First Selectman. By charter, the 
First Selectman is the Chief Executive and Administrative Officer of the 
town. The town's legislative powers are divided between the Board of Selectmen 
and the Town Meeting. Among other elective boards are the Board of Education, 
the Board of Finance, the Planning and Zoning Commission, and the Board 
of Police Commissioners.[13] For the fiscal year of 2014–2015, the Town 
of Weston’s gross budget is about $67-million. About 70 percent of the 
town’s budget is spent on the Weston Public Schools.[14] Weston raises 
taxes on the basis of property value. With real estate assessed at 70 percent 
of market value, the mill rate evolved as follows: To show the evolution 
of the mill rate, the asterisked numbers are adjusted to account for the 
revaluation of 2013-2014. The revaluation decreased the real estate property 
values by 13.18 percent, not counting a 0.75 percent natural growth in 
real estate stock during the revaluation.[15] Besides, the numbers for 
2008–2009 and prior years are further adjusted for the 2008-2009 revaluation 
which added 2.92 percent to Weston's grand list of properties.[16] There 
are four public schools in the Weston Public Schools district,[17] all 
located on School Road: In June 2012, 24/7 Wall St. ranked Weston as the 
second wealthiest school district in the United States.[18] In May 2013, 
and again in 2014 U.S. News & World Report ranked Weston High School as 
the third best high school in the state and 240th best high school in the 
country out of more than 22,000 high schools assessed throughout the country 
including public and private.[19] Weston High School was awarded the Gold 
medal for its high level of student performance. The methodology of ranking 
the high schools is based on student performance on standardized tests 
as well as student participation in Advanced Placement (AP) or International 
Baccalaureate (IB) programs. The AP exam participation rate is 60% of Weston 
High School students. In August 2015, Newsweek ranked Weston High School 
#47 for America's Top High Schools in the country, public and private.[20] 
In Aug 2015, Weston High School was ranked the best in the state and 47th 
best in the country according to a survey conducted by Newsweek magazine. 
Each year, the magazine ranks the top 500 high schools in the country based 
on which institutions do the best job of preparing students for college.

rate, a 100% graduation rate, an AP/IB/Dual Enrollment Composite of 73,

in Connecticut.[22] Several pre-schools in town are run by various churches, 
including Emmanuel Nursery School and Norfield Nursery School. The landscape 
of Weston is characterized by open spaces. Almost one quarter of the town 
is permanently devoted to open space use,[23] including: Coordinates: 41°13′32″N
