Steven Earl McCatty (born March 20, 1954) is a former Major League Baseball 
pitcher who played for the Oakland Athletics from 1977 to 1985. He graduated 
from Troy High School in Troy, Michigan in 1972. He coached the Washington 
Nationals from 2009 through 2015. On August 10, 1980, McCatty pitched a 
14 inning game against the Seattle Mariners, only to lose 2â€“1. During the 
1981 strike-shortened season, McCatty was second in the American League 
with a 2.33 ERA and was tied with three others with most wins with 14, 
including 4 shutouts, the last two of which were consecutive starts for 
McCatty. He finished second for the Cy Young Award, behind Rollie Fingers. 
During a 1982 exhibition game against the San Diego Padres, McCatty stepped 
to the plate wielding a toy 15-inch bat but was refused by umpire Jim Quick 
to hit. McCatty was instructed by A's manager Billy Martin, who was furious 
that the designated hitter rule was not allowed in National League ballparks, 
to use the toy bat as a protest. After retiring as a player in 1986, he 
remained in professional baseball working in radio and TV for the Oakland 
A's and with ESPN Major League Baseball. McCatty later moved on to coach 
several minor league baseball clubs, and was hired as pitching coach by 
the Detroit Tigers for the 2002 season. He subsequently coached for the 
Ottawa Lynx when it was the AAA affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles. During 
the offseason, McCatty works with youngsters of all ages to teach pitching 
mechanics at Jason Thompson Baseball in Auburn Hills, Michigan. In 2009, 
McCatty became the second pitching coach in Washington Nationals franchise 
history, replacing Randy St. Claire, who was fired, and McCatty was called 
upon to replace him after working at the Nationals' AAA affiliate. The 
Nationals fired McCatty and the entire coaching staff after the 2015 season.[1]
