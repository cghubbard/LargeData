Brian Keith O'Nora (born February 7, 1963) is an umpire in Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He joined the major league staff in 2000, after previously 
umpiring for the American League (AL) from 1992 to 1999 and wears uniform 
number 7. O'Nora previously worked the Appalachian League (1985), the Midwest 
League (1986–1987), the Eastern League (1988–1989), the Pacific Coast League 
(1990), the American Association (1991), the International League, the 
Florida Instructional League (1985–1989) and the Puerto Rican Winter League 
(1990–1992). Since joining the Major League umpiring staff in 2000, O'Nora 
has worked the 2004 National League Division Series, the 2006 National 
League Division Series, the 2009 National League Division Series, the 2010 
American League Division Series, and the 2012 National League Division 
Series. He also umpired the 2008 American League Championship Series and 
the 2012 World Series. He was a part of the crew that worked in the 2000 
and 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Games. On June 24, 2008, during 
a game between the Colorado Rockies and the Kansas City Royals, O'Nora 
was accidentally struck in the head by a fragment from Miguel Olivo's broken 
bat. O'Nora sustained a mild concussion and a laceration on his forehead, 
and he was hospitalized until the next day.[1][2] In April 2013, O'Nora 
suffered an intestinal tear and had to leave a game between the New York 
Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies.[3] On September 1, 2013, O'Nora departed 
during another game, this time involving the Rockies and the Cincinnati 
Reds, because he was experiencing illness.[4] On September 25, 2003, O'Nora 
was the plate umpire for Carlos Delgado's four-homer game.[5] In 2011, 
O'Nora was one of two MLB umpires (the other being Scott Barry) who were 
selected to officiate the MLB-All Stars Taiwan series; Barry and O'Nora 
were joined by two Taiwanese umpires for the games.[6] During Spring training 
in 2014, O'Nora served as the replay umpire for the first use of expanded 
replay in a Major League Baseball game. After Toronto Blue Jays manager 
John Gibbons elected to challenge a safe call made by first base umpire 
Fieldin Culbreth, O'Nora upheld the ruling following a video review that 
lasted 2 minutes and 34 seconds.[7] He currently lives in Austintown, Ohio.
