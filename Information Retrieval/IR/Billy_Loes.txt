William Loes (December 13, 1929 – July 15, 2010) was an American right-handed 
pitcher who spent eleven seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the 
Brooklyn Dodgers (1950, 1952–56), Baltimore Orioles (1956–59) and San Francisco 
Giants (1960–61). He appeared in three World Series with the Dodgers, including 
the only one won by the franchise when it was based in Brooklyn in 1955. 
In an 11-season career, Loes posted an 80–63 record with 645 strikeouts 
and a 3.89 ERA in 1190.1 innings pitched. He made the American League All-Star 
team in 1957. The book Carl Erskine's Tales from the Dodgers Dugout: Extra 
Innings (2004) includes short stories from former Dodger pitcher and teammate 
Carl Erskine. Loes is prominent in many of these stories. Among Major League 
Baseball's video archives is a television broadcast of the sixth game of 
the 1952 World Series, of which Loes was one of the starting pitchers. 
During the game, announcer Red Barber states that Loes was the son of Greek 
immigrants who had changed his last name. Further, says Barber, Loes would 
not tell Barber what his original last name was because, according to Loes, 
Barber would be unable to pronounce, spell or remember that name. Loes 
distinguished himself in several ways in the 1952 World Series. When asked 
how the Dodgers would fare, he predicted the Yankees would win in seven, 
but was misquoted as saying the Yankees would win in six.[1] During the 
sixth game, he became the first pitcher in World Series history to commit 
a balk. In the seventh inning, he was starting his windup when the ball 
dropped from his hand. "Too much spit on it", he said later.[2] Then a 
grounder hit by Yankee pitcher Vic Raschi bounced off his leg for a single, 
allowing a run to score. Afterward, he said he lost the ground ball in 
the sun. Loes holds a unique distinction, having witnessed, as a player 
involved in the game, four players hitting four home runs in a game. When 
Brooklyn's Gil Hodges hit four home runs in a game in 1950 he had just 
been called up to the Dodgers; when the Braves' Joe Adcock hit four against 
Brooklyn in 1954, Loes was still with the Dodgers; when Cleveland's Rocky 
Colavito hit four against Baltimore in 1959, Loes was with the Orioles; 
and when Willie Mays hit four home runs in 1961 against the Braves, Loes 
was a teammate on the Giants. Loes also famously said that he did not want 
to be a 20-game winner, "because then I'd be expected to do it every year."[3] 
His career high in wins came in 1953, when he went 14–8 for the pennant-winning
