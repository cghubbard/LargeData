Earl Jesse Battey, Jr. (January 5, 1935 – November 15, 2003) was an American 
professional baseball player.[1] He played in Major League Baseball as 
a catcher for the Chicago White Sox (1955–1959), the Washington Senators 
(1960) and the Minnesota Twins (1961–1967).[1] In the early 1960s, Battey 
was one of the top catchers in the American League, winning three consecutive 
Gold Glove Awards between 1960 and 1962.[1] Born in Los Angeles, Battey 
attended Jordan High School in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles.[2] 
He was signed as an amateur free agent by the Chicago White Sox prior to 
the 1953 season.[1] Battey was assigned to the Colorado Springs Sky Sox 
in the Single-A Western League where he began his baseball career by hitting 
only a .158 batting average in 26 games.[3] The White Sox demoted him to 
the Waterloo White Hawks in the B-level Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League and 
Battey responded with a .292 average and 11 home runs in 129 games.[3] 
In 1955, Battey was promoted to the Triple-A Charleston Senators in the 
American Association where, he hit for a .269 batting average along with 
8 home runs and 71 runs batted in.[3] His performance earned him a promotion 
to the major leagues where he made his debut with the White Sox on September 
10, 1955 Chicago White Sox season|1955]] at the age of 20.[1] Battey returned 
to the minor leagues in 1956, playing in 36 games for the Toronto Maple 
Leafs.[3] Despite hitting only .178, he played well defensively. The White 
Sox called him back to the major leagues to back up starting catcher Sherm 
Lollar, for the remainder of the season although, he spent the time on 
the bench and would only play in four games.[1][3] Battey continued to 
learn from the perrenial All-Star Lollar during the 1957 season but struggled 
offensively.[2] He was sent back to the minor leagues in August where he 
would hit 9 home runs and 20 runs batted in for the Triple-A Los Angeles 
Angels of the Pacific Coast League.[3][4] The White Sox recalled Battey 
to the major leagues in September – this time to stay.[5] Battey would 
hit .226 along with 8 home runs in 1958 as, the White Sox would battle 
back from being in last place on June 14 to finish the season in second 
place behind the New York Yankees.[1][6] In 1959 he was overtaken by rookie 
Johnny Romano as the second string catcher, ending the year hitting .219 
in 26 games.[1] Although the White Sox won the American League pennant, 
Battey wouldn't appear in the post-season as the White Sox lost to the 
Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1959 World Series.[7] Realizing they had a logjam 
at catcher with the veteran, and still productive, Lollar, the impressive 
rookie Romano, and the still-valuable-as-a-defensive-backup Battey, White 
Sox owner and general manager Bill Veeck would solve his problem in two 
deals that would show immediate dividends for the White Sox, but would 
be long term disasters. On December 6, 1959, Veeck traded Romano, rookie 
first baseman Norm Cash, and utility man Bubba Phillips to the Cleveland 
Indians for outfielder Minnie Miñoso, catcher Dick Brown, pitcher Don Ferrarese, 
and minor league pitcher Jake Striker.[8] Then on April 4, 1960, Veeck 
would ship Battey, first baseman Don Mincher, and $150,000 to the Washington 
Senators for veteran first baseman Roy Sievers.[2] Although both Sievers 
and Miñoso would combine for three 20-home run seasons, two All-Star appearances, 
one Gold Glove award in 1960 and 1961 with the White Sox, the rest of the 
players the team received in trade were largely of the replacement level. 
Conversely the young players that the Sox parted with (to get these veterans), 
namely Battey, Mincher, Romano, and Cash, would all sparkle, and account 
for 17 20-home run seasons, four 30-home run seasons, one 40-home run season, 
12 all-star team selections, three Gold Gloves (all by Battey), and would 
garner Most Valuable Player support in numerous seasons.[9][10][11] Meanwhile, 
the catcher that the White Sox chose to keep, Lollar, would go into decline 
after 1959, be relegated to a backup role in 1962, and would retire after 
the 1963 season, leaving the White Sox with an underwhelming starter catcher, 
including a two-year return of an aging Romano in 1965, before regaining 
some form of stability behind the plate in 1969 with Ed Herrmann (who would 
go on to lead the American League in passed balls in four of his six full 
seasons with the Sox).[12] Battey became the starting catcher for the Senators 
and began to show his defensive abilities, leading the American League 
in assists and putouts for four consecutive years from 1960 to 1963 but, 
it would be offensively where Battey would shine and start hitting as he 
had done in the minor leagues.[13] Battey would go on to play in a then-career 
high 137 games and hit .270, with 15 home runs and 60 RBI.[1] He would 
also earn his first Gold Glove Award and finish eighth in the 1960 American 
League Most Valuable Player Award.[14][15] In October, Battey was named 
to the United Press International's American League All-Star team.[16] 
Prior to the 1961 season, the Senators relocated to the Minneapolis-St. 
Paul metro area and were renamed the Minnesota Twins.[17] Battey would 
team with future Baseball Hall of Fame member Harmon Killebrew, future 
MVP Zoilo Versalles, and All-Stars Bob Allison, Camilo Pascual, and Jim 
Kaat to form the nucleus of a pennant-winning team in Minnesota. Building 
on his breakout 1960 season, Battey ended 1961 with a .302 batting average, 
sixth best in the American League, and won his second Gold Glove Award.[18][19] 
Battey was recognized as one of the top catchers in the major leagues when 
he was selected to be the starting catcher for the American League in the 
1962 All-Star Games.[20] He was the Twins catcher on August 26, 1962, when 
pitcher Jack Kralick threw a no-hitter.[21] Battey appeared in a career-high 
148 games and ended the season with a .280 batting average, highest among 
major league catchers.[1][22] He also set a record for major league catchers 
by picking off 15 base runners as he won his third consecutive Gold Glove 
Award.[23][24] The Twins, long an American League doormat while in Washington, 
would finish a surprising second in the American League standings with 
91 wins (5 games behind the World Series winning New York Yankees.[25] 
Battey would have his finest season at the plate in 1963, hitting .285 
while setting career highs in home runs (26), RBI (84), and slugging percentage 
(.476).[1] He would also be voted to his second straight All-Star team 
(where he would collect his only all-star hit, a third-inning single that 
scored Boston Red Sox third baseman Frank Malzone from secondbase to tie 
the game at 3-3), and finish seventh in the American League Most Valuable 
Player Award balloting (behind Killebrew and winner and fellow catcher 
Elston Howard).[26] The Twins would again finish with 91 wins but, this 
time it would put them no better than third place, 15½ games behind the 
World Series runner-up Yankees. Both Battey and the Twins would take a 
step backward in 1964 with the team struggling to a 79 win, sixth-place 
finish in the American League while Battey would hit .272 with 12 home 
runs and 51 RBI in 131 games.[1] Battey recovered in 1965 and was hitting 
near .300 at mid-season when he received the most All-Star votes by an 
American League player for the 1965 All-Star Game which was played in his 
home ball park, Metropolitan Stadium.[27][28] He was one of six Twins to 
appear in the 1965 mid-season classic (with Versalles, Killebrew, Jimmie 
Hall, Mudcat Grant, and Tony Oliva).[29] Battey was an integral member 
of the Twins team that went on to clinch the American League pennant, hitting 
for a .297 batting average and finished in tenth place in voting for the 
American League Most Valuable Player Award (with teammate Versalles winning 
and six Twins finishing in the top 15).[1][30] He started every game in 
the 1965 World Series but only hit for a .120 average with 2 RBI and only 
one extra base hit as the Twins lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a seven-game 
series.[31] In 1966, Battey hit .255 with 4 home runs and 31 RBI while 
playing in 115 games, his lowest total since his backup days in Chicago.[1] 
Battey was selected for his fourth and last All-Star game, coming into 
the game in the bottom of the sixth inning for starter, Tiger catcher Bill 
Freehan.[32] The 1967 season would be Battey's last as he battled a thyroid 
condition that caused him to gain weight.[33] He would appear in only 48 
games and hit for just a .165 average.[1] The Twins three catchers that 
season, Battey, Jerry Zimmerman, and Russ Nixon, combined to only hit .176 
and the Twins went 2-5 in late September and lost the pennant to the Red 
Sox in the last game of the season.[34] In a thirteen-year major league 
career, Battey played in 1,141 games, accumulating 969 hits in 3,586 at 
bats for a .270 career batting average along with 104 home runs and 449 
RBI.[1] He led the American League four times in assists and putouts, three 
times in baserunners caught stealing and twice in caught stealing percentage, 
with a career fielding percentage of .990.[1] A four-time All-Star, Battey 
won three Gold Glove Awards.[35] Over his career, he threw out 43.44% of 
the base runners who tried to steal a base on him, 15th on the all-time 
list.[36] In 1961, the reigning American League stolen base champion, Luis 
Aparicio, rated Battey as the toughest catcher on which to attempt a stolen 
base.[37] Richard Kendall of the Society for American Baseball Research 
devised an unscientific study that ranked Battey as the seventh most dominating 
fielding catcher in major league history.[38] Battey played more games 
at catcher than any other player in Twins history (831).[39] He was named 
to the Twins' 40th anniversary team in 2000.[40] Battey was one of the 
first Major League players to wear an earflap on his batting helmet in 
1961 after twice suffering broken cheekbones when hit by pitches.[13][41] 
After his playing career, he next spent 12 years working in New York City 
as a recreation specialist with young disturbed boys. Fulfilling a promise 
he had made to his mother, Battey enrolled at Bethune-Cookman University 
in 1980. Taking 34 credits a semester, he finished his undergraduate degree 
in Education in 2½ years, while coaching the men's basketball team, and 
was accorded the distinction of Summa Cum Laude honors.[42] After graduating 
from Bethune-Cookman, he became a high school teacher and baseball coach 
in Ocala, Florida.[7] Battey was also part of a charity program sponsored 
by Consolidated Edison whereby children were given free bleacher tickets 
to New York Yankee games.[40] He talked baseball and was a "big brother" 
to all the kids who were lucky enough to benefit from the program. Battey 
died of cancer at the age of 68 in Ocala, Florida.[40] In 2004, Battey 
was posthumously elected to the Twins Hall of Fame.[43] In 2010, the Twins 
celebrated their 50th season in Minnesota and Battey was voted as one of
