The West Michigan Whitecaps are a Class A minor league baseball team, affiliated 
with the Detroit Tigers, that plays in the Midwest League. Their home games 
are played in Comstock Park, Michigan, a suburb of Grand Rapids. The Midwest 
League came to the Grand Rapids area in 1994 upon the arrival of the former 
Madison Muskies. The Whitecaps were brought to West Michigan by local businessmen 
Lew Chamberlin and Dennis Baxter. The Whitecaps were affiliated with the 
Oakland Athletics before they joined the Tigers' farm system in 1997. Their 
home ballpark is Fifth Third Ballpark in Comstock Park. Before the 2002 
season it was known as Old Kent Park; the name was changed when the park's 
title sponsor, Old Kent Bank, was purchased by Fifth Third Bank. Fifth 
Third also sponsors a ballpark in Dayton and one in Toledo, Ohio. The team's 
official mascots are Crash the River Rascal, Roxy the River Rascal and 
Franky the Swimming Pig. The franchise's attendance record of 547,401 was 
set in 1996. Several league and team records were set during the 2006 season. 
The team posted the second best record in franchise history, going 89–48, 
including going 23–6 in July. Michael Hollimon hit 3 home runs in one game. 
Cameron Maybin hit 2 grand slams in the season. Michael Hernandez became 
the first person ever in the history of the Midwest League to hit for the 
cycle twice. The Whitecaps went on to defeat the Kane County Cougars in 
four games to win their fourth Midwest League Championship. In 2009, the 
team drew the attention of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine 
after a 4-pound, 4,800-calorie hamburger called the Fifth Third Burger 
was placed on the menu of the team's concession stand. It was so named 
in part for the ballpark sponsor and part for its 1.6666 (or 5/3) pounds 
of meat. The Committee requested that the team put a label on the burger 
indicating that it was a "dietary disaster".[2] To date, more than 100 
fans, or about a half of the people who have attempted the challenge, have 
conquered the burger and earned a commemorative T-shirt. On July 15, 2009, 
Travel Channel's "Man v. Food" and its host Adam Richman came to Fifth 
Third Ballpark to attempt to conquer the burger in an episode of the popular 
show. The episode aired on September 30, 2009, wherein he successfully 
met the challenge. In 2012, The Whitecaps installed a new scoreboard and 
high resolution video display screen which was installed by TS Sports out 
of Dallas, Texas. On January 3, 2014 a fire started in one of the suites. 
It spread and caused extensive damage, close to one half of the suites 
and 1st base concourse were destroyed.[3] Thanks to extensive work, the 
park was restored and up and running by opening day.[4] The Whitecaps have 
won the best-of-5 Midwest League championship six times in six opportunities. 
They defeated the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers in 1996, the Rockford Cubbies 
in 1998, the Kane County Cougars twice (2004 and 2006), the Beloit Snappers 
in 2007, and the Cedar Rapids Kernels in 2015. West Michigan is 52–29 all 
time in playoff games. Since 1994, the Whitecaps have had nine managers. 
In 2007, former Tigers' third baseman Tom Brookens became the fifth manager 
in the history of the Whitecaps. Listed here are each manager and their
