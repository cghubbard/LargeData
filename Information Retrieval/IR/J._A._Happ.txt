James Anthony "J. A." Happ (born October 19, 1982) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He has also played in MLB for the Philadelphia Phillies, Houston Astros, 
Seattle Mariners, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Though his name is James Anthony 
and his initials are "J. A.", he pronounces his name as "Jay".[1] He is 
6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) tall and weighs 205 pounds (93 kg). Happ was born 
in Peru, Illinois, and raised with two older sisters. He attended high 
school at St. Bede Academy, where he was a four-year letter winner in baseball 
and basketball. He was named Bureau County Athlete of the Year during his 
senior season. After graduating from high school in 2001, Happ enrolled 
in Northwestern University, where he majored in history. He was named to 
the All-Big Ten First Team in his freshman, sophomore, and junior seasons, 
during which he compiled a 16–11 win–loss record, an ERA of 2.88, and a 
251/90 strikeout-to-walk ratio over 228.1 innings pitched.[2] Happ chose 
to forgo his senior season and entered the 2004 Major League Baseball draft, 
where he was selected in the third round (92nd overall) by the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[3] Happ throws five pitches: a four-seam fastball (89–95 mph), 
a two-seam fastball (89-93), a slider/cutter (83–86), a curveball (76–79), 
and a changeup (82-84). Happ relies on all of his pitches against right-handed 
hitters, but does not use the changeup against left-handers. He commonly 
mixes his curveball with his fastball in two-strike counts.[4] Immediately 
after agreeing to terms with the Phillies on June 16, 2004, Happ was assigned 
to the Batavia Muckdogs of the Short-season A-level New York–Penn League, 
where he posted a 2.02 ERA in eleven starts, averaging more than one strikeout 
per inning pitched. Happ again impressed in 2005 with the low-A Lakewood 
BlueClaws. While Happ played for only half of the season, he compiled a 
2.36 ERA in 72⅓ innings. He was promoted to Double-A for a single game 
at the end of the season, in which he gave up only one earned run in six 
innings and struck out eight. In 2006, Happ began the season for the Clearwater 
Threshers of the High-A Florida State League, but earned a promotion to 
the Double-A Reading Phillies at midseason. He also pitched one game at 
the end of the season for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, then the 
Phillies' Triple-A affiliate. Combined for the year, Happ went 10–9, with 
an ERA of 2.69, 162 strikeouts, and 49 walks in 160⅔ innings. He was rewarded, 
during the following offseason, with his first appearance in Baseball America's 
"Top Ten Prospects" list for the Phillies organization, in which he was 
ranked eighth. (Prior to this, Happ had rarely been identified as a prospect 
despite his impressive performances in 2004 and 2005 due to his average 
pitch velocity.) After pitching in the Arizona Fall League in the fall 
of 2006, Happ moved with the Red Barons to Ottawa for the 2007 season. 
On June 30, 2007, while suffering from a spate of injuries to their starting 
rotation, the Phillies purchased Happ's contract from the Lynx. At the 
time, Happ's record in Triple-A was 1–2 with a 4.02 ERA. He made his major 
league debut against the New York Mets and allowed five runs, all earned, 
in four innings. He was then returned to the Lynx and did not pitch at 
the major league level again that season, thus ending the year with an 
11.25 major league ERA.[5] Happ struggled upon his return to Ottawa. Despite 
striking out 36 batters over five starts in the months of July and August,[6] 
Happ's ERA ballooned to 5.02 by the end of the season. It was later revealed 
that he had been pitching that season with elbow fatigue. As a result, 
he did not participate in any fall or winter leagues during the following 
offseason. Happ began the 2008 season with the Phillies' new Triple-A affiliate 
in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the Lehigh Valley IronPigs. He went 5–6 with 
a 3.54 ERA in his first seventeen starts, striking out 104 batters in 101⅔ 
innings. On July 4, Happ was called up to take the place of Brett Myers 
in the Phillies' starting rotation, after the struggling Myers went to 
the minors in an effort to regain his form. That same night, Happ made 
his season debut against Johan Santana and the Mets. He fared better in 
his second major league start, pitching 4⅔ innings, giving up three hits, 
two earned runs, four walks while striking out three. He earned a no-decision 
as the Phillies went on to win the game, 3–2. Happ was also awarded a no-decision 
in his third career start (second of the season), in which he pitched 6⅓ 
innings and gave up two runs, but the Phillies went on to defeat the Cardinals 
by a 4–2 score. He was then optioned back to Lehigh Valley, as the Phillies 
would not need a fifth starter for two weeks.[7] Myers regained his place 
in the rotation on July 23. Happ was recalled to the major leagues on July 
29 when the struggling Adam Eaton was demoted to Lakewood.[8] However, 
Happ never took Eaton's spot in the rotation, as the Phillies had already 
acquired starter Joe Blanton from the Oakland Athletics on July 17. Happ 
instead pitched out of the bullpen, appearing in two games (in which he 
struggled), and was then sent to Triple-A once again. He ended the Triple-A 
season at 8–7, with a 3.60 ERA. He was second among International League 
pitchers with 151 strikeouts in 135 innings.[9] Happ joined the Phillies 
for the third time in 2008 on September 1 when the rosters expanded. On 
September 16, Phillies manager Charlie Manuel announced that Happ would 
start on the following night against the Atlanta Braves, replacing the 
struggling Kyle Kendrick. Happ pitched six shutout innings in the game, 
earning his first major league win in a 6–1 Phillies victory. Happ was 
named to the postseason roster, and pitched in one game in the National 
League Championship Series. In total, Happ posted a 1–0 record in 2008, 
with an ERA of 3.69 and 26 strikeouts over 31 2⁄3 innings.[5] Happ became 
a member of the starting rotation after fifth starter Chan Ho Park struggled 
in his starts and was sent to the bullpen. Happ threw his first career 
complete game and shutout against the Toronto Blue Jays on June 27, 2009. 
He got his first major league hit on July 2, against the Atlanta Braves. 
It came during the fifth inning with two outs and no one on base. On August 
5, Happ pitched his second career shutout, giving up four hits and striking 
out ten in a home game against the Colorado Rockies. In that game, he also 
collected his first career extra-base hit, an eighth-inning double off 
Rockies pitcher Josh Fogg. He became the first rookie pitcher to 10 wins 
on August 22 against the New York Mets. He made his first career post-season 
start against the Rockies on October 11, 2009. On October 20, 2009, Happ 
was named Sporting News NL Rookie of the Year.[10] He was also named by 
his fellow players as Players Choice Awards NL Outstanding Rookie. Baseball 
fans voted him the MLB "This Year in Baseball Awards" Rookie of the Year.[11] 
He came in second in balloting for MLB's Jackie Robinson Rookie of the 
Year Award.[12][13] He was also selected as the left-handed pitcher on 
the Topps MLB All-Star Rookie team. Baseball America chose him as one of 
the five pitchers on its All-Rookie Team.[14] The Philadelphia chapter 
of the Baseball Writers' Association of America presented him the "Steve 
Carlton Most Valuable Pitcher" award. In 2009, Happ posted a 12–4 record, 
2.93 ERA, 119 strikeouts, and a 1.24 WHIP.[5] With the Phillies in 2010, 
Happ made three starts totaling 15 1⁄3 innings and earned a 1–0 record, 
1.76 ERA, nine strikeouts, and a 1.63 WHIP.[5] On July 29, 2010, Happ was 
traded to the Houston Astros along with minor leaguers Anthony Gose and 
Jonathan Villar in exchange for Roy Oswalt.[15][16] He would make 13 starts 
with Houston in 2010, going 5–4 with a 3.75 ERA, 61 strikeouts, and a 1.32 
WHIP in 72 innings.[5] The following season, Happ would post his worst 
career numbers, with a 6–15 record, a 5.35 ERA, 134 strikeouts, and a 1.54 
WHIP in a career-high 156 1⁄3 innings pitched.[5] On June 13, 2012, Happ 
earned a place in history as the opposing starting pitcher for Matt Cain's 
perfect game. Happ pitched 3 1⁄3 innings, gave up 11 hits, and 8 runs, 
all of which were earned runs. With Houston in 2012, he posted a 7–9 record 
with a 4.83 ERA, 98 strikeouts, and a 1.45 WHIP in 104 1⁄3 innings.[5] 
Happ was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays on July 20, 2012, along with Brandon 
Lyon, and David Carpenter, for Francisco Cordero, Ben Francisco, Asher 
Wojciechowski, David Rollins, Joe Musgrove, Carlos Pérez, and Kevin Comer.[17] 
Happ worked as a reliever for the Blue Jays until the demotion of Brett 
Cecil allowed him to be promoted to the vacant starting role.[18] On September 
7, the Jays announced that Happ would undergo surgery on a fractured right 
foot and miss the rest of the season. Happ made 10 appearances (6 starts) 
with the Blue Jays in 2012, and finished with a 3-2 record and a 4.46 ERA.[19] 
On January 18, 2013, it was announced that the Blue Jays had avoided arbitration 
with Happ, signing him to a one-year contract worth $3.7 million.[20] On 
May 7, 2013, in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays, Happ was hit in the 
head by a line drive hit by Desmond Jennings. He collapsed immediately, 
but remained conscious and after lying on the mound for 11 minutes, he 
was taken off the field on a stretcher and taken to Bayfront Medical Center.[21][22] 
The nursing supervisor told the Associated Press that Happ had been admitted 
to the hospital and was in stable condition.[23][24] Happ remained in hospital 
overnight, and was released the next morning with a head contusion and 
a laceration to his left ear.[25][26] Happ was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list after being released from the hospital.[27] He was then transferred 
to the 60-day disabled list on May 24 to make room for Sean Nolin.[28] 
Happ was activated from the disabled list on August 5, and retook his role 
in the starting rotation.[29] After making his start on August 12, Happ 
was placed on the bereavement list due to the death of his grandfather.[30] 
In his first start at Tropicana Field since he was struck by a line drive, 
Happ recorded the win, pitching 5 1⁄3 innings and giving up 2 earned runs 
on 5 hits with 5 strikeouts.[31][32] In total in 2013, Happ made 18 starts 
totaling 92 2⁄3 innings, and posted a record of 5–7, a 4.56 ERA, 77 strikeouts, 
and a 1.45 WHIP.[5] On March 26, 2014, Happ was placed on the disabled 
list.[33] He began the season pitching out of the bullpen. When Dustin 
McGowan was removed from the rotation, Happ was given the 5th starter spot 
and made his first start of the season on May 5. On August 7, he set a 
career-high for strikeouts, with 12, in a 2–1 loss to the Baltimore Orioles.[34] 
Happ earned his 50th career win on September 22, when the Blue Jays defeated 
the Seattle Mariners 14–4. He pitched 7 innings and yielded 2 earned runs, 
while also earning his 700th strikeout. He made his final start of the 
2014 season on September 27, against the Baltimore Orioles. Taking the 
win, 4–2, Happ leveled his record for the season at 11–11, and finished 
with a 4.22 ERA, 133 strikeouts, and a 1.34 WHIP in 30 appearances (26 
starts) totaling 158 innings pitched.[5] On November 1, the Blue Jays picked 
up Happ's $6.7 million option for the 2015 season.[35] On December 3, 2014, 
Happ was traded to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for outfielder Michael 
Saunders.[36][37] Happ made 20 starts and 1 relief appearance for the Mariners, 
compiling a 4–6 record with a 4.64 ERA and 82 strikeouts.[5] On July 31, 
2015, Happ was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Adrian Sampson.[38] 
In 11 starts for Pittsburgh, Happ posted a 7–2 record, 1.85 ERA, and 69 
strikeouts.[5] On November 27, 2015, Happ signed a three-year, $36 million 
contract with the Blue Jays.[39] He became the Blue Jays' first pitcher 
to earn eleven wins prior to the All-Star break since Roy Halladay in 2008, 
when he defeated the Cleveland Indians 17–1 on July 3, 2016.[40] In his 
next start, Happ recorded his 12th victory of the 2016 season, 6–0 over 
the Detroit Tigers, which tied his career-high and matched the twelve wins 
Halladay posted before the All-Star break in 2006.[41] On July 24, Happ 
earned his 13th win of the season, defeating the Seattle Mariners 2–0 and 
establishing a new single-season high in wins.[42] Happ tied Stephen Strasburg 
for the MLB lead in wins on August 4,[43] and took the outright lead with 
his 16th victory of the season on August 10.[44] Happ earned his 20th win 
of the 2016 season on September 20, defeating Seattle 10–2.[45] In doing 
so, he joined Halladay, Roger Clemens, Pat Hentgen, David Wells, and Jack 
Morris as the only pitchers to win 20 games or more for the Blue Jays in 
a single season.[46] Happ finished the 2016 season with a 20–4 record, 
3.18 ERA, and 163 strikeouts in 195 innings.[5] Happ started game two of 
the 2016 American League Division Series and earned the win, pitching five 
innings and allowing a single run on nine hits with five strikeouts. The 
win gave the Blue Jays a 2–0 series lead over the Texas Rangers.[47] Happ 
finished sixth in voting for the 2016 American League Cy Young Award, receiving 
three third place votes, two fourth place votes, and one fifth place vote.[48]
