(i/hɒnˈdʊərəs/; Spanish: [onˈduɾas]), officially the Republic of Honduras 
(Spanish: República de Honduras), is a republic in Central America. It 
has at times been referred to as Spanish Honduras to differentiate it from 
British Honduras, which became modern-day Belize.[5] Honduras is bordered 
to the west by Guatemala, to the southwest by El Salvador, to the southeast 
by Nicaragua, to the south by the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Fonseca, 
and to the north by the Gulf of Honduras, a large inlet of the Caribbean 
Sea. Honduras was home to several important Mesoamerican cultures, most 
notably the Maya, before the Spanish invaded in the sixteenth century. 
The Spanish introduced Roman Catholicism and the now predominant Spanish 
language, along with numerous customs that have blended with the indigenous 
culture. Honduras became independent in 1821 and has since been a republic, 
although it has consistently endured much social strife and political instability, 
and remains one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. Honduras 
has the world's highest murder rate.[6] Honduras spans about 112,492 km2 
and has a population exceeding 8 million. Its northern portions are part 
of the Western Caribbean Zone, as reflected in the area's demographics 
and culture. Honduras is known for its rich natural resources, including 
minerals, coffee, tropical fruit, and sugar cane, as well as for its growing 
textiles industry, which serves the international market. Honduras literally 
means "depths" in Spanish. The name could either refer to the bay of Trujillo 
as an anchorage, fondura in the Leonese dialect of Spanish, or to Columbus's 
alleged quote that "Gracias a Dios que hemos salido de esas Honduras" ("Thank 
God we have departed from those depths").[7][8][9] It was not until the 
end of the 16th century that Honduras was used for the whole province. 
Prior to 1580, Honduras only referred to the eastern part of the province, 
and Higueras referred to the western part.[9] Another early name is Guaymuras, 
revived as the name for the political dialogue in 2009 that took place 
in Honduras as opposed to Costa Rica. [10] In pre-Columbian times, modern 
Honduras was part of the Mesoamerican cultural area. In the west, the Maya 
civilization flourished for hundreds of years. The dominant state within 
Honduras's borders was in Copán. Copán fell with the other Lowland centres 
during the conflagrations of the Terminal Classic in the 9th century. The 
Maya of this civilization survive in western Honduras as the Ch'orti', 
isolated from their Choltian linguistic peers to the west.[11] Remains 
of other Pre-Columbian cultures are found throughout the country. Archaeologists 
have studied sites such as Naco (es) and La Sierra in the Naco Valley, 
Los Naranjos on Lake Yojoa, Yarumela in the Comayagua Valley,[12] La Ceiba 
and Salitron Viejo[13] (both now under the Cajon Dam reservoir), Selin 
Farm and Cuyamel in the Aguan valley, Cerro Palenque, Travesia, Curruste, 
Ticamaya, Despoloncal in the lower Ulua river valley, and many others. 
On his fourth and the final voyage to the New World in 1502, Christopher 
Columbus landed near the modern town of Trujillo, in the vicinity of the 
Guaimoreto Lagoon and became the first European to visit the Bay Islands 
on the coast of Honduras.[14] On 30 July 1502 Columbus sent his brother 
Bartholomew to explore the islands and Bartholomew encountered a Mayan 
trading vessel from Yucatán, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo.[15] 
Bartholomew's men stole whatever cargo they wanted and kidnapped the ship's 
elderly captain to serve as an interpreter[16] in what was the first recorded 
encounter between the Spanish and the Maya.[17] In March 1524, Gil González 
Dávila became the first Spaniard to enter Honduras as a conquistador.[18][19] 
followed by Hernán Cortés, bringing forces down from Mexico. Much of the 
conquest was done in the following two decades, first by groups loyal to 
Cristóbal de Olid, and then by those loyal of Francisco Montejo but most 
particularly by those following Alvarado. In addition to Spanish resources, 
the conquerors relied heavily on armed forces from Mexico—Tlaxcalans and 
Mexica armies of thousands who lived on in the region as garrisons. Resistance 
to conquest was led in particular by Lempira, and many regions in the north 
never fell to the Spanish, notably the Miskito Kingdom. After the Spanish 
conquest, Honduras became part of Spain's vast empire in the New World 
within the Kingdom of Guatemala. Trujillo and Gracias were the first city-capitals. 
The Spanish ruled the region for approximately three centuries. Honduras 
was organized as a province of the Kingdom of Guatemala and the capital 
was fixed, first at Trujillo on the Atlantic coast, and later at Comayagua, 
and finally at Tegucigalpa in the central part of the country. Silver mining 
was a key factor in the Spanish conquest and settlement of Honduras.[20] 
Initially the mines were worked by local people through the encomienda 
system, but as disease and resistance made this option less available, 
slaves from other parts of Central America were brought in. When local 
slave trading stopped at the end of the sixteenth century, African slaves, 
mostly from Angola, were imported.[21] After about 1650, very few slaves 
or other outside workers arrived in Honduras. Although the Spanish conquered 
the southern or Pacific portion of Honduras fairly quickly, they were less 
successful on the northern, or Atlantic side. They managed to found a few 
towns along the coast, at Puerto Caballos and Trujillo in particular, but 
failed to conquer the eastern portion of the region and many pockets of 
independent indigenous people as well. The Miskito Kingdom in the northeast 
was particularly effective at resisting conquest. The Miskito Kingdom found 
support from northern European privateers, pirates and especially the British 
(formerly English) colony of Jamaica, which placed much of its territory 
under its protection after 1740. Honduras became independent from Spain 
in 1821 and was for a time part of the First Mexican Empire until 1823 
when it became part of the United Provinces of Central America. It has 
been an independent republic since 1838 and held regular elections. In 
the 1840s and 1850s Honduras participated in several failed attempts to 
restore Central American unity, such as the Confederation of Central America 
(1842–1845), the covenant of Guatemala (1842), the Diet of Sonsonate (1846), 
the Diet of Nacaome (1847) and National Representation in Central America 
(1849–1852). Although Honduras eventually adopted the name Republic of 
Honduras, the unionist ideal never waned, and Honduras was one of the Central 
American countries that pushed the hardest for a policy of regional unity. 
Neoliberal policies favoring international trade and investment began in 
the 1870s, and soon foreign interests became involved, first in shipping, 
especially tropical fruit and most notably bananas, from the north coast, 
and then in building railroads. In 1888, a projected railroad line from 
the Caribbean coast to the capital, Tegucigalpa, ran out of money when 
it reached San Pedro Sula. As a result, San Pedro grew into the nation's 
primary industrial center and second-largest city. Comayagua was the capital 
of Honduras until 1880, when the capital moved to Tegucigalpa. Since independence, 
nearly 300 small internal rebellions and civil wars have occurred in the 
country, including some changes of régime. In the late nineteenth century, 
Honduras granted land and substantial exemptions to US-based fruit and 
infrastructure companies[which?] in return for developing the country's 
northern regions. Thousands of workers came to the north coast, as a result, 
to work in banana plantations and other businesses that grew up around 
the export industry. Banana-exporting companies, dominated until 1930 Cuyamel 
Fruit Company, as well as the United Fruit Company, and Standard Fruit 
Company, built an enclave economy in northern Honduras, controlling infrastructure 
and creating self-sufficient, tax-exempt sectors that contributed relatively 
little to economic growth. American troops landed in Honduras in 1903, 
1907, 1911, 1912, 1919, 1924 and 1925.[22] In 1904 the writer O. Henry 
coined the term "Banana republic" to describe Honduras.[23] In addition 
to drawing Central American workers north, the fruit companies also encouraged 
immigration of workers from the English-speaking Caribbean, notably Jamaica 
and Belize, which introduced an African-descended, English-speaking and 
largely Protestant population into the country, although many of these 
workers left after immigration law changes in 1939.[24] Honduras joined 
the Allied Nations after Pearl Harbor, on 8 December 1941, and signed the 
Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942 along with twenty-five 
other governments. Constitutional crises in the 1940s led to reforms in 
the 1950s. One reform gave workers permission to organize, and a 1954 general 
strike paralyzed the northern part of the country for more than two months, 
but led to reforms. In 1963 a military coup unseated democratically-elected 
President Ramón Villeda Morales. In 1969 Honduras and El Salvador fought 
what became known as the Football War. Border tensions led to acrimony 
between the two countries after Oswaldo López Arellano, a president of 
Honduras, blamed the deteriorating Honduran economy on immigrants from 
El Salvador. The relationship reached a low when El Salvador met Honduras 
for a three-round football elimination match preliminary to the World Cup.[25][clarification 
needed] Tensions escalated and on 14 July 1969, the Salvadoran army launched 
an attack on the Honduran army[where?]. The Organization of American States 
negotiated a cease-fire which took effect on 20 July and brought about 
a withdrawal of Salvadoran troops in early August.[25] Contributing factors 
to the conflict were a boundary dispute and the presence of thousands of 
Salvadorans living in Honduras illegally. After the week-long war as many 
as 130,000 Salvadoran immigrants were expelled.[26] Hurricane Fifi caused 
severe damage when it skimmed the northern coast of Honduras on 18 and 
19 September 1974. Melgar Castro (1975–78) and Paz Garcia (1978–82) largely 
built the current physical infrastructure and telecommunications system 
of Honduras.[27] In 1979, the country returned to civilian rule . A constituent 
assembly was popularly elected in April 1980 to write a new constitution, 
and general elections were held in November 1981. The constitution was 
approved in 1982 and the PLH government of Roberto Suazo won the election 
with a promise to carry out an ambitious program of economic and social 
development to tackle the recession Honduras was in. He launched ambitious 
social and economic development projects sponsored by American development 
aid. Honduras became host to the largest Peace Corps mission in the world, 
and nongovernmental and international voluntary agencies proliferated. 
The Peace Corps withdrew its volunteers in 2012, citing safety concerns.[28] 
During the early 1980s the United States established a continuing military 
presence in Honduras to support El Salvador, the Contra guerrillas fighting 
the Nicaraguan government, and also develop an air strip and modern port 
in Honduras. Though spared the bloody civil wars wracking its neighbors, 
the Honduran army quietly waged campaigns against Marxist-Leninist militias 
such as the Cinchoneros Popular Liberation Movement, notorious for kidnappings 
and bombings,[29] and against many non-militants as well. The operation 
included a CIA-backed campaign of extrajudicial killings by government-backed 
units, most notably Battalion 316.[30] In 1998, Hurricane Mitch caused 
massive and widespread destruction. Honduran President Carlos Roberto Flores 
said that fifty years of progress in the country had been reversed. Mitch 
destroyed about 70% of the crops and an estimated 70–80% of the transportation 
infrastructure, including nearly all bridges and secondary roads. Across 
Honduras 33,000 houses were destroyed, and an additional 50,000 damaged. 
Some 5,000 people killed, and 12,000 more injured. Total losses were estimated 
at $3 billion USD.[31] The 2008 Honduran floods were severe and damaged 
or destroyed around half of the roads as a result.[32] In 2009, a constitutional 
crisis resulted when power transferred in a coup from the president to 
the head of Congress. The Organization of American States (OAS) suspended 
Honduras because it did not feel its government was legitimate.[33][34] 
Countries around the world, the OAS, and the United Nations[35] formally 
and unanimously condemned the action as a coup d'état and refused to recognize 
the de facto government, even though the lawyers consulted by the Library 
of Congress submitted to the United States Congress an opinion that declared 
the coup was legal.[35][36][37] The Honduran Supreme Court also ruled that 
the proceedings had been legal. The government that followed the de facto 
government established a truth and reconciliation commission, Comisión 
de la Verdad y Reconciliación, which after more than a year of research 
and debate concluded that the ousting had been a coup d'état, and illegal 
in the commission's opinion.[38][39][40] The north coast of Honduras borders 
the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean lies south through the Gulf of 
Fonseca. Honduras consists mainly of mountains, with narrow plains along 
the coasts. A large undeveloped lowland jungle, La Mosquitia lies in the 
northeast, and the heavily populated lowland Sula valley in the northwest. 
In La Mosquitia lies the UNESCO world-heritage site Río Plátano Biosphere 
Reserve, with the Coco River which divides Honduras from Nicaragua. The 
Islas de la Bahía and the Swan Islands are off the north coast. Misteriosa 
Bank and Rosario Bank, 130 to 130 to 150 kilometres (81 to 93 miles) north 
of the Swan Islands, fall within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Honduras. 
Natural resources include timber, gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, iron 
ore, antimony, coal, fish, shrimp, and hydropower. The climate varies from 
tropical in the lowlands to temperate in the mountains. The central and 
southern regions are relatively hotter and less humid than the northern 
coast. The region is considered a biodiversity hotspot because of the many 
plant and animal species found there. Like other countries in the region, 
it contains vast biological resources. Honduras hosts more than 6,000 species 
of vascular plants, of which 630 (described so far) are orchids; around 
250 reptiles and amphibians, more than 700 bird species, and 110 mammal 
species, of which half are bats.[41] In the northeastern region of La Mosquitia 
lies the Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve, a lowland rainforest which is home 
to a great diversity of life. The reserve was added to the UNESCO World 
Heritage Sites List in 1982. Honduras has rain forests, cloud forests (which 
can rise up to nearly three thousand metres or 9,800 feet above sea level), 
mangroves, savannas and mountain ranges with pine and oak trees, and the 
Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. In the Bay Islands there are bottlenose 
dolphins, manta rays, parrot fish, schools of blue tang and whale shark. 
Deforestation resulting from logging is rampant in Olancho Department. 
The clearing of land for agriculture is prevalent in the largely undeveloped 
La Mosquitia region, causing land degradation and soil erosion. Lake Yojoa, 
which is Honduras' largest source of fresh water, is polluted by heavy 
metals produced from mining activities.[42] Some rivers and streams are 
also polluted by mining.[43] Honduras is governed within a framework of 
a presidential representative democratic republic. The President of Honduras 
is both head of state and head of government. Executive power is exercised 
by the Honduran government. Legislative power is vested in the National 
Congress of Honduras. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and 
the legislature. The National Congress of Honduras (Congreso Nacional) 
has 128 members (diputados), elected for a four-year term by proportional 
representation. Congressional seats are assigned the parties' candidates 
on a departmental basis in proportion to the number of votes each party 
receives.[1] In 1963, a military coup removed the democratically elected 
president, Ramón Villeda Morales. A string of authoritarian military governments 
held power uninterrupted until 1981, when Roberto Suazo Córdova was elected 
president. Today, the party system is dominated by the conservative National 
Party of Honduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras: PNH) and the liberal Liberal 
Party of Honduras (Partido Liberal de Honduras: PLH). Since 1981 Honduras 
has had six Liberal Party presidents: Roberto Suazo Córdova, José Azcona 
del Hoyo, Carlos Roberto Reina, Carlos Roberto Flores, Manuel Zelaya and 
Roberto Micheletti, and four National Party Presidents: Rafael Leonardo 
Callejas Romero, Ricardo Maduro, Porfirio Lobo Sosa and Juan Orlando Hernández. 
Another coup in 2009 removed Zelaya from office and put Micheletti in his 
place. Current Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández took office on 
27 January 2014. Two Honduran names that surfaced in the Panama Papers 
disclosures belong to highly successful businessmen from some of Honduras' 
most prominent families. Jaime Rosenthal and Gilberto Goldstein are among 
the elite of Honduras, both successful businessmen and politicians. Rosenthal 
was a vice-president in the 1980s administration of José Azcona del Hoyo. 
His son César Rosenthal was, according to the Panama Papers, the sole stockholder 
of Renton Management S.A., a Panamanian entity created to purchase airplanes. 
Honduras and Nicaragua had tense relations throughout 2000 and early 2001 
due to a boundary dispute off the Atlantic coast. Nicaragua imposed a 35% 
tariff against Honduran goods due to the dispute. In June 2009 a coup d'état 
ousted President Manuel Zelaya; he was taken in a military aircraft to 
neighboring Costa Rica. The General Assembly of the United Nations voted 
to denounce the coup and called for the restoration of Zelaya. Several 
Latin American nations including Mexico temporarily severed diplomatic 
relations with Honduras. In July 2010, full diplomatic relations were once 
again re-established with Mexico.[44] The United States sent out mixed 
messages after the coup; Obama called the ouster a coup and expressed support 
for Zelaya's return to power. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, advised 
by John Negroponte, the former Reagan-era to Honduras implicated in the 
Iran-Contra affair, refrained from expressing support.[45] She has since 
explained that the US would have had to cut aid if it called Zelaya's ouster 
a military coup, although the US has a record of ignoring these events 
when it chooses.[46] Zelaya had expressed an interest in Hugo Chávez' Bolivarian 
Alliance for Peoples of our America (ALBA), and had actually joined in 
2008. After the 2009 coup, Honduras withdrew its membership. This interest 
in regional agreements may have increased the alarm of establishment politicians. 
When Zelaya began calling for a "fourth ballot box" to determine whether 
Hondurans wished to convoke a special constitutional congress, this sounded 
a lot to some like the constitutional amendments that had extended the 
terms of both Hugo Chavez and Evo Morales. "Chavez has served as a role 
model for like-minded leaders intent on cementing their power. These presidents 
are barely in office when they typically convene a constitutional convention 
to guarantee their reelection," said a 2009 Spiegel International analysis,[47] 
which noted that one reason to join ALBA was discounted Venezuelan oil. 
In addition to Chavez and Morales, Carlos Menem of Argentina, Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso of Brazil and Columbian President Álvaro Uribe had all 
taken this step, and Washington and the EU were both accusing the Sandanista 
government in Nicaragua of tampering with election results.[47] Politicians 
of all stripes expressed opposition to Zelaya's referendum proposal, and 
the Attorney-General accused him of violating the constitution. The Honduran 
Supreme Court agreed, saying that the constitution had put the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal in charge of elections and referenda, not the National 
Statistics Institute, which Zelaya had proposed to have run the count.[48] 
Whether or not Zelaya's removal from power had constitutional elements, 
the Honduran constitution explicitly protects all Hondurans from forced 
expulsion for Honduras. The United States maintains a small military presence 
at one Honduran base. The two countries conduct joint peacekeeping, counter-narcotics, 
humanitarian, disaster relief, humanitarian, medical and civic action exercises. 
U.S. troops conduct and provide logistics support for a variety of bilateral 
and multilateral exercises. The United States is Honduras' chief trading 
partner.[27] Honduras has a modest military with Western equipment. Honduras 
is divided into 18 departments. The capital city is Tegucigalpa in the 
Central District within the department of Francisco Morazán. A new administrative 
division called ZEDE (Zonas de empleo y desarrollo económico) was created 
in 2013. ZEDEs have a high level of autonomy with its own political system 
at a judicial, economic and administrative level, and are based on free 
market capitalism. The currency is the Honduran lempira. Economic growth 
in the last few years has averaged 7% a year, one of the highest rates 
in Latin America (2010). In 2010, 50% of the population were below the 
poverty line however.[49] Estimates put unemployment at more than 1.2 million 
people, or 27.9%. According to the Human Development Index, Honduras is 
the sixth-poorest/least-developed country in Latin America, behind Haiti, 
Nicaragua, Guatemala, Guyana, and Bolivia. Honduras was declared a heavily 
indebted poor country by the World Bank and the International Monetary 
Fund[when?]. It became eligible for debt relief in 2005. The government 
operates both the electrical grid, Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica 
(ENEE) and the land-line telephone service, Hondutel. ENEE receives heavy 
subsidies to counter its chronic financial problems, but Hondutel is no 
longer a monopoly. The telecommunication sector was opened to private investment 
on 25 December 2005, as required under CAFTA. The price of petroleum is 
regulated, and the Congress often ratifies temporary price regulation for 
basic commodities. Gold, silver, lead and zinc are mined.[50] In 2005 Honduras 
signed CAFTA, a free trade agreement with the United States. In December 
2005, Puerto Cortes, the primary seaport of Honduras, was included in the 
U.S. Container Security Initiative.[51] In 2006 the U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security and the Department of Energy announced the first phase 
of the Secure Freight Initiative (SFI), which built upon existing port 
security measures. SFI gave the U.S. government enhanced authority, allowing 
it to scan containers from overseas[clarification needed] for nuclear and 
radiological materials in order to improve the risk assessment of individual 
US-bound containers. The initial phase of Secure Freight involved deploying 
of nuclear detection and other devices to six foreign ports: Containers 
in these ports have been scanned since 2007 for radiation and other risk 
factors before they are allowed to depart for the United States.[52] For 
economic development a 2012 memorandum of understanding with a group of 
international investors obtained Honduran government approval to build 
a zone (city) with its own laws, tax system, judiciary and police, but 
opponents brought a suit against it in the Supreme Court, calling it a 
"state within a state".[53] In 2013, Honduras' Congress ratified Decree 
120, which led to the establishment of ZEDEs. The government began construction 
of the first zones in June 2015.[54] About half of the electricity sector 
in Honduras is privately owned. The remaining generation capacity is run 
by ENEE (Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica). Key challenges in the 
sector are: Infrastructure for transportation in Honduras consists of: 
699 kilometres (434 miles) of railways; 13,603 kilometres (8,453 miles) 
of roadways;[1] seven ports and harbors;[citation needed] and 112 airports 
altogether (12 Paved, 100 unpaved).[1] The Ministry of Public Works, Transport 
and Housing (SOPRTRAVI in Spanish acronym) is responsible for transport 
sector policy. Water supply and sanitation in Honduras differ greatly from 
urban centers to rural villages. Larger population centers generally have 
modernized water treatment and distribution systems, however water quality 
is often poor because of lack of proper maintenance and treatment. Rural 
areas generally have basic drinking water systems with limited capacity 
for water treatment. Many urban areas have sewer systems in place for the 
collection of wastewater, but proper treatment of wastewater is scarce. 
In rural areas sanitary facilities are generally limited to latrines and 
basic septic pits. Water and sanitation services were historically provided 
by the Servicio Autónomo de Alcantarillas y Aqueductos (es) (SANAA). In 
2003, the government enacted a new "water law" which called for the decentralization 
of water services. Under the 2003 law, local communities have both the 
right and the responsibility to own, operate, and control their own drinking 
water and wastewater systems. Since this law passed, many communities have 
joined together to address water and sanitation issues on a regional basis. 
Many national and international non-government organizations have a history 
of working on water and sanitation projects in Honduras. International 
groups include the Red Cross, Water 1st, Rotary Club, Catholic Relief Services, 
Water for People, EcoLogic Development Fund, CARE, the Canadian Executive 
Service Organization (CESO-SACO), Engineers Without Borders – USA, Flood 
The Nations, Students Helping Honduras (SHH), Global Brigades, and Agua 
para el Pueblo[55] in partnership with AguaClara at Cornell University. 
In addition, many government organizations work on projects in Honduras, 
including the European Union, the USAID, the Army Corps of Engineers, Cooperacion 
Andalucia, the government of Japan, and others. Honduras had a population 
of 8,143,564 in 2011.[1] The proportion of the population aged below 15 
in 2010 was 36.8%, 58.9% were aged between 15 and 65 years of age, and 
4.3% were aged 65 years or older.[56] Since 1975, emigration from Honduras 
has accelerated as economic migrants and political refugees sought a better 
life elsewhere. A majority of expatriate Hondurans live in the United States. 
A 2012 US State Department estimate suggested that between 800,000 and 
one million Hondurans lived in the United States at that time, nearly 15% 
of the Honduran population.[27] The large uncertainty about numbers is 
because numerous Hondurans live in the United States without a visa. In 
the 2010 census in the United States, 617,392 residents identified as Hondurans, 
up from 217,569 in 2000.[57] In addition to Spanish a number of indigenous 
languages are spoken in Honduras, as well as Honduran sign language and 
Bay Islands Creole English.[58] The main indigenous languages are: The 
Lenca isolate lost all its fluent native speakers in the 20th century but 
is currently undergoing revival efforts among the members of the ethnic 
population of about 100,000. The largest immigrant languages are Arabic 
(42,000), Armenian (1,300), Turkish (900), Yue Chinese (1,000).[58] These 
are the top 10 most populated cities in Honduras as per the 2010 estimates.[59] 
Although most Hondurans are nominally Roman Catholic (which would be considered 
the main religion), membership in the Roman Catholic Church is declining 
while membership in Protestant churches is increasing. The International 
Religious Freedom Report, 2008, notes that a CID Gallup poll reported that 
51.4% of the population identified themselves as Catholic, 36.2% as evangelical 
Protestant, 1.3% claiming to be from other religions, including Muslims, 
Buddhists, Jews, Rastafarians, etc. and 11.1% do not belong to any religion 
or unresponsive. Customary Catholic church tallies and membership estimates 
81% Catholic where the priest (in more than 185 parishes) is required to 
fill out a pastoral account of the parish each year.[60][61] The CIA Factbook 
lists Honduras as 97% Catholic and 3% Protestant.[1] Commenting on statistical 
variations everywhere, John Green of Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life 
notes that: "It isn't that ... numbers are more right than [someone else's] 
numbers ... but how one conceptualizes the group."[62] Often people attend 
one church without giving up their "home" church. Many who attend evangelical 
megachurches in the US, for example, attend more than one church.[63] This 
shifting and fluidity is common in Brazil where two-fifths of those who 
were raised evangelical are no longer evangelical and Catholics seem to 
shift in and out of various churches, often while still remaining Catholic.[64] 
Most pollsters suggest an annual poll taken over a number of years would 
provide the best method of knowing religious demographics and variations 
in any single country. Still, in Honduras are thriving Anglican, Presbyterian, 
Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist, Lutheran, Latter-day Saint (Mormon) and 
Pentecostal churches. There are Protestant seminaries. The Catholic Church, 
still the only "church" that is recognized, is also thriving in the number 
of schools, hospitals, and pastoral institutions (including its own medical 
school) that it operates. Its archbishop, Oscar Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga, 
is also very popular, both with the government, other churches, and in 
his own church. Practitioners of the Buddhist, Jewish, Islamic, Bahá'í, 
Rastafari and indigenous denominations and religions exist.[65] The fertility 
rate is approximately 3.7 per woman.[66] The under-five mortality rate 
is at 40 per 1,000 live births.[66] The health expenditure was US$ (PPP) 
197 per person in 2004.[66] There are about 57 physicians per 100,000 people.[66] 
About 83.6% of the population are literate and the net primary enrollment 
rate was 94% in 2004.[66] However, in 2007 the primary school completion 
rate was reported to be 40%.[citation needed] Honduras has bilingual (Spanish 
and English) and even trilingual (Spanish with English, Arabic, and/or 
German) schools and numerous universities.[67] The higher education is 
governed by the National Autonomous University of Honduras which has centers 
in the most important cities of Honduras. Owing to insufficient law enforcement 
resources, crime in Honduras is rampant and criminals operate with a high 
degree of impunity. Consequently, Honduras has one of the highest murder 
rates in the world. Official statistics from the Honduran Observatory on 
National Violence show Honduras’ homicide rate was 60 per 100,000 in 2015 
with the majority of homicide cases being unprosecuted.[68] Highway assaults 
and carjackings at roadblock or checkpoints set up by criminals with police 
uniforms and equipment occur frequently. Although reports of kidnappings 
of foreigners are not common, families of kidnapping victims often pay 
ransoms without reporting the crime to police out of fear of retribution, 
so kidnapping figures may be underreported.[68] Owing to measures taken 
by government and business in 2014 to improve tourism security, Roatan 
and the Bay Islands have lower crime rates than the Honduran mainland.[68] 
In the less populated region of Gracias a Dios, narcotics-trafficking is 
rampant and police presence is scarce. Threats against U.S. citizens by 
drug traffickers and other criminal organizations have resulted in the 
U.S. Embassy placing restrictions on the travel of U.S. officials through 
the region.[68] The most renowned Honduran painter is Jose Antonio Velásquez. 
Other important painters include Carlos Garay, and Roque Zelaya. Some of 
Honduras' most notable writers are Lucila Gamero de Medina, Froylán Turcios, 
Ramón Amaya Amador and Juan Pablo Suazo Euceda, Marco Antonio Rosa,[69] 
Roberto Sosa, Eduardo Bähr, Amanda Castro, Javier Abril Espinoza, Teófilo 
Trejo, and Roberto Quesada. Hondurans are often referred to as Catracho 
or Catracha (fem) in Spanish. The word was coined by Nicaraguans and derives 
from the last name of the Spanish Honduran General Florencio Xatruch, who 
in 1857 led Honduran armed forces against an attempted invasion by North 
American adventurer William Walker. The nickname is considered complimentary, 
not derogatory. The José Francisco Saybe theater in San Pedro Sula is home 
to the Círculo Teatral Sampedrano (Theatrical Circle of San Pedro Sula) 
Honduran cuisine is a fusion of indigenous Lenca cuisine, Spanish cuisine, 
Caribbean cuisine and African cuisine. There are also dishes from the Garifuna 
people. Coconut and coconut milk are featured in both sweet and savory 
dishes. Regional specialties include fried fish, tamales, carne asada and 
baleadas. Other popular dishes include: meat roasted with chismol and carne 
asada, chicken with rice and corn, and fried fish with pickled onions and 
jalapeños. Some of the ways seafood and some meats are prepared in coastal 
areas and in the Bay Islands involve coconut milk. The soups Hondurans 
enjoy include bean soup, mondongo soup tripe soup, seafood soups and beef 
soups. Generally these soups are served mixed with plantains, yuca, and 
cabbage, and served with corn tortillas. Other typical dishes are the montucas 
or corn tamales, stuffed tortillas, and tamales wrapped in plantain leaves. 
Honduran typical dishes also include an abundant selection of tropical 
fruits such as papaya, pineapple, plum, sapote, passion fruit and bananas 
which are prepared in many ways while they are still green. At least half 
of the Honduran households have at least one television. Public television 
has a far smaller role than in most other countries. Honduras' main newspapers 
are La Prensa, El Heraldo, La Tribuna and Diario Tiempo. The official newspaper 
is La Gaceta (Honduras) (es). Punta is the main music of Honduras, with 
other sounds such as Caribbean salsa, merengue, reggae, and reggaeton all 
widely heard, especially in the north, and Mexican rancheras heard in the 
rural interior of the country. Some of Honduras' national holidays include 
Honduras Independence Day on 15 September and Children's Day or Día del 
Niño, which is celebrated in homes, schools and churches on 10 September; 
on this day, children receive presents and have parties similar to Christmas 
or birthday celebrations. Some neighborhoods have piñatas on the street. 
Other holidays are Easter, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Day of the Soldier 
(3 October to celebrate the birth of Francisco Morazán), Christmas, El 
Dia de Lempira on 20 July,[70] and New Year's Eve. Honduras Independence 
Day festivities start early in the morning with marching bands. Each band 
wears different colors and features cheerleaders. Fiesta Catracha takes 
place this same day: typical Honduran foods such as beans, tamales, baleadas, 
cassava with chicharron, and tortillas are offered. On Christmas Eve people 
reunite with their families and close friends to have dinner, then give 
out presents at midnight. In some cities fireworks are seen and heard at 
midnight. On New Year's Eve there is food and "cohetes", fireworks and 
festivities. Birthdays are also great events, and include piñatas filled 
with candies and surprises for the children. La Feria Isidra is celebrated 
in La Ceiba, a city located in the north coast, in the second half of May 
to celebrate the day of the city's patron saint Saint Isidore. People from 
all over the world come for one week of festivities. Every night there 
is a little carnaval (carnavalito) in a neighborhood. On Saturday there 
is a big parade with floats and displays with people from many countries. 
This celebration is also accompanied by the Milk Fair, where many Hondurans 
come to show off their farm products and animals. The flag of Honduras 
is composed of three equal horizontal stripes, with the upper and lower 
ones being blue and representing the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The 
central stripe is white. It contains five blue stars representing the five 
states of the Central American Union. The middle star represents Honduras, 
located in the center of the Central American Union. The coat of arms was 
established in 1945. It is an equilateral triangle, at the base is a volcano 
between three castles, over which is a rainbow and the sun shining. The 
triangle is placed on an area that symbolizes being bathed by both seas. 
Around all of this an oval containing in golden lettering: "Republic of 
Honduras, Free, Sovereign and Independent". The "National Anthem of Honduras" 
is a result of a contest carried out in 1914 during the presidency of Manuel 
Bonilla. In the end, it was the poet Augusto Coello that ended up writing 
the anthem, with German-born Honduran composer Carlos Hartling writing 
the music. The anthem was officially adopted on 15 November 1915, during 
the presidency of Alberto de Jesús Membreño (es). The anthem is composed 
of a choir and seven stroonduran[clarification needed]. The national flower 
is the famous orchid, Rhyncholaelia digbyana (formerly known as Brassavola 
digbyana), which replaced the rose in 1969. The change of the national 
flower was carried out during the administration of general Oswaldo López 
Arellano, thinking that Brassavola digbiana "is an indigenous plant of 
Honduras; having this flower exceptional characteristics of beauty, vigor 
and distinction", as the decree dictates it. The national tree of Honduras 
was declared in 1928 to be simply "the Pine that appears symbolically in 
our Coat of Arms" (el Pino que figura simbólicamente en nuestro Escudo),[71] 
even though pines comprise a genus and not a species, and even though legally 
there's no specification as for what kind of pine should appear in the 
coat of arms either. Because of its commonality in the country, the Pinus 
oocarpa species has become since then the species most strongly associated 
as the national tree, but legally it is not so. Another species associated 
as the national tree is the Pinus caribaea. The national mammal is the 
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), which was adopted as a measure 
to avoid excessive depredation[clarification needed]. It is one of two 
species of deer that live in Honduras. The national bird of Honduras is 
the scarlet macaw (Ara macao). This bird was much valued by the pre-Columbian 
civilizations of Honduras. Legends and fairy tales are paramount within 
Honduran culture. Lluvia de Peces (Rain of Fish) is an example of this. 
The legends of El Cadejo, La Llorona and La Ciguanaba (La Sucia) are also 
popular. The Honduran nation, has in its history with two nominations for 
the Nobel Prize. Football is the most popular sport in Honduras. Information
