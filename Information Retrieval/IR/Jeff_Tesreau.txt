Charles Monroe "Jeff" Tesreau (March 5, 1888 – October 24, 1946) was an 
American Major League Baseball player. Tesreau initially signed with a 
minor league team of the St. Louis Browns in 1909. In 1910, his contract 
was purchased by the New York Giants. After two years in the minors, Tesreau 
learned how to throw a spitball, which became his signature pitch. He started 
the second game of the 1912 season for the Giants. The New York Times wrote, 
"Tesreau has curves which bend like barrel hoops and speed like lightning. 
He's just the kind of a strong man McGraw has been looking for." In the 
1912 World Series, Tesreau went 1–2 against Boston Red Sox ace Smoky Joe 
Wood. In 1912, Tesreau was 17–7 and had a league leading ERA of 1.96. ERA 
officially became a statistic of Major League Baseball in 1912, and Tesreau 
along with the American League's Walter Johnson became the first players 
recognized for leading the major leagues in that category. On September 
6 of that season, Tesreau no-hit the Philadelphia Phillies 3-0. From 1912 
to 1917, Tesreau remained a starting pitcher with the Giants. In 1918, 
he had an argument with manager John McGraw and quit the team in the middle 
of the season. In 1919, Tesreau refused to play for the Giants, and McGraw 
refused to trade or release him. Tesreau took a position as baseball coach 
for the Dartmouth Big Green baseball team of Dartmouth College, a position 
he held until his death on September 24, 1946. He won 348 games as coach 
for Dartmouth, often coaching against Joe Wood, who had become the Yale 
University Yale Bulldogs baseball coach. Standing 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m), Tesreau 
was given the nickname "Jeff" because he resembled boxer Jim Jeffries.[1] 
Tesreau suffered a stroke while on a fishing trip in 1946. He died a few
