As coach Euclides Rojas (born August 25, 1967 in Havana) is a Cuban-born 
coach and player development official in Major League Baseball. On November 
24, 2010, he was named bullpen coach of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Rojas was 
a right-handed relief pitcher in his playing days. He was the Cuban National 
Team's all-time leader in saves before he and 12 others left their homeland 
by raft in 1994, were rescued by the United States Coast Guard, and eventually 
emigrated to the United States.[1] Rojas played independent league baseball 
in 1995 before being acquired by the Florida Marlins in his adopted city 
of Miami, Florida. Rojas pitched for two seasons in the Marlins' system 
— including service with the Triple-A Charlotte Knights for eight games 
— before injuries ended his active career. He won four games and lost six, 
appearing in 29 games with an earned run average of 4.56. He batted right-handed 
and stood 6 feet (1.83 m) tall and weighed 210 pounds (95 kg) as an active 
player. In 1997, he became a full-time coach in the Marlins' system, a 
post that he held through 2001. In 1999, he was briefly a member of the 
Marlins' MLB coaching staff, serving as interim bullpen coach. He spent 
the 2002 season with the Pirates as Latin American pitching coordinator, 
and rejoined the Pittsburgh system in 2005. Rojas spent six seasons (2005–2010) 
as the Pirates' Latin American field coordinator of instruction.[2] He 
was the bullpen coach of the Boston Red Sox during the full seasons of 
2003–2004, a period during which the Red Sox went to Game 7 of the 2003 
American League Championship Series and won the 2004 American League pennant
