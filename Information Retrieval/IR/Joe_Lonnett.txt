Joseph Paul Lonnett (February 7, 1927 – December 5, 2011) was a catcher 
and coach in Major League Baseball.[1] As a player, he threw and batted 
right-handed, stood 5'10½" (179 cm) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg). 
Lonnett signed with the Philadelphia Phillies as an amateur free agent 
in 1948, and spent much of his career with the Phillies as a minor league 
catcher and manager, and Major League catcher and scout. He missed two 
seasons while serving in the United States Navy in World War II and the 
Korean War. He spent four seasons as a catcher in MLB with the Phillies, 
as a second-string receiver, appearing in 143 games, and batting .166 with 
six home runs and 27 runs batted in — never once cracking the .200 level 
for a season. He returned to the Major Leagues as the third-base coach 
on Chuck Tanner's staff with the Chicago White Sox from 1971–75, and the 
Oakland Athletics in 1976. Tanner, also a native of Western Pennsylvania 
and a former Major League outfielder, had promised that if he ever became 
a big league manager, Lonnett would be one of his coaches. Tanner honored 
his word, and Lonnett worked with him with the White Sox and A's. When 
Tanner was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Manny Sanguillén — only 
the second trade in MLB history to involve a manager — Lonnett followed 
him to Pittsburgh. He wore Sanguillen's No. 35 jersey until the Pirates 
traded for Sanguillen a year later. He then wore No. 32 and would eventually 
serve as the third-base coach on the Pirates' 1979 world championship team. 
In all, he coached eight seasons (1977–84) for the Buccos. Lonnett battled 
Alzheimer's disease and was cared for by his wife of 56 years, Alvida. 
He attended the 25th anniversary celebration of the World Series champions 
in 2004 at PNC Park. Lonnett died in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania on December
