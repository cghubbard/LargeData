William Angel Rariden (February 4, 1888 in Bedford, Indiana â€“ August 28, 
1942 in Bedford, Indiana), was an American professional baseball player. 
He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher from 1909 to 1920 for the 
Boston Doves/Rustlers/Braves, Indianapolis Hoosiers/Newark Pepper, New 
York Giants, and Cincinnati Reds.[1] A light-hitting defensive specialist, 
Rariden set the major league record for most assists by a catcher in a 
season with 238 while playing for the Newark Pepper of the Federal League 
in 1915.[2] Before Rariden's career, most catchers were large, slow-footed 
players.[3] Rariden's small size and agility helped him become one of the 
best catchers in major league baseball.[3] Major League status was retroactively 
applied to the Federal League in 1968. He also had the second highest total 
with 215 in 1914.[2] In the Deadball Era during which Rariden played, catchers 
played a huge defensive role, given the large number of bunts and stolen 
base attempts, therefore catchers of his era usually accumulated higher 
assist totals than did those of subsequent eras.[4] Rariden had his best 
year offensively with the New York Giants in 1917 when he posted a .271 
batting average in 101 games as, the Giants won the National League pennant 
before being defeated by the Chicago White Sox in the 1917 World Series.[5] 
Rariden was also a member of the 1919 Cincinnati Reds team that won the 
scandal-plagued 1919 World Series against the Chicago White Sox.[6] In 
a twelve-year major league career, Rariden played in 982 games, accumulating 
682 hits in 2,877 at bats for a .237 career batting average along with 
7 home runs and 272 runs batted in.[1] He ended his career with a .972 
fielding percentage.[1] Rariden led Federal League catchers twice in putouts, 
twice in assists and twice in baserunners caught stealing.[1] He led National
