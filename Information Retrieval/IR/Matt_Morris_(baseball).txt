Matthew Christian Morris (born August 9, 1974) is a former Major League 
Baseball right-handed starting pitcher. He retired on April 30, 2008.[1] 
Morris attended Valley Central High School in New York before attending 
Seton Hall University, where he played baseball for the Pirates under head 
coach Mike Sheppard. He was drafted 12th overall in the June 1995 free 
agent draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. Morris pitched in the minor leagues 
in 1996 and 1997. In 1996, led the Texas League with 4 shutouts while pitching 
for the Double-A Arkansas Travelers and led all Cardinal minor league pitchers 
with 175 innings pitched. In 1997, he reached the majors after only one 
game at Triple-A Louisville. In his first season, he won 12 games with 
a 3.19 ERA and finished tied for second in the Rookie of the Year voting, 
behind Scott Rolen.[2] In 1999, he underwent Tommy John surgery after he 
was injured in spring training.[3] Morris became the ace of the Cardinals' 
pitching staff in 2001, earning his first All-Star selection and a 3rd-place 
finish in the NL Cy Young voting. He won 22 games with 185 strikeouts and 
a 3.16 ERA. In 2002, he won 17 games and made his second All-Star appearance. 
In 2004, Morris signed a one-year contract after he won 15 games on a Cardinals 
team that made the World Series. In 2004, he lost 10 games for the first 
time in his career and had a 4.72 ERA, also a career high. Morris underwent 
surgery during the 2004/2005 off-season and started the season 8-0 with 
a 3.16 ERA, and was 10-2 with a 3.10 ERA at the time of the All-Star break. 
In fact, he was considered by many to be snubbed for the All-Star game. 
Morris went 4-7 with a 5.55 ERA after the All-Star break. He was the number 
three starter for the Cardinals in the playoffs, behind ace Chris Carpenter, 
and Mark Mulder. In the thin free-agent market of the 2005/2006 off-season, 
Morris was touted as one of the best available pitchers. On December 12, 
2005, Morris signed a 3-year contract with the San Francisco Giants worth 
$27 million. He had an injury-filled year with the Giants in 2006, going 
10-15 with a 4.98 ERA.[4] Prior to the 2007 season, Morris changed his 
uniform number from 35, which he had worn for his entire career, to wear 
number 22 as a tribute to retired former teammate Mike Matheny. Rich Aurilia 
took the number 35 jersey. On July 31, 2007, Morris was traded to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates for center field prospect Rajai Davis and pitcher Stephen MacFarland. 
Morris started off the 2008 season with a 0-4 record and a 9.67 ERA in 
5 starts. On April 27, 2008, Morris was released by the Pirates.[5] He 
retired three days later.[6] Morris married the former Heather Reader on
