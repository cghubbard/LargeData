The Toronto Maple Leafs were a high-level minor league baseball club located 
in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that played from 1896 to 1967. While the Maple 
Leafs had working agreements with numerous Major League Baseball clubs 
after the introduction of farm systems in the 1930s, they achieved great 
success as an unaffiliated club during the 1950s, when they were the strongest 
team on the field and in attendance in the Triple-A International League. 
Toronto was without professional baseball from 1968–1976, when the American 
League added the Toronto Blue Jays via the 1977 Major League Baseball expansion. 
The first Toronto baseball organization, the Toronto Baseball Club, played 
in the Canadian League in 1885, playing its home games at William Cawthra's 
Jarvis Street Lacrosse Grounds (Old Lacrosse Grounds) at the northwest 
corner of Jarvis and Wellesley Street.[1] It finished the season in third 
place. The next year, renamed the Toronto Canucks, the team left the Canadian 
League along with Hamilton to join the original International League (also 
known as the International Association), where it played from 1886–1890. 
The baseball stadium that would come to be known as Sunlight Park was built 
for the team and opened on May 22, 1886, with Toronto defeating Rochester 
10–3 in front of 3,000 fans. Toronto won the pennant in 1887, behind 33-game-winner 
Edward Nicholas Cannonball Crane, who also led the team in hitting with 
a .428 batting average (walks were counted as hits for that season). The 
league folded in July 1890. In 1895, Toronto resurfaced in the original 
Eastern League (which in 1902 was designated Class A, at that time one 
level below Major League Baseball), where it played through 1911. The club 
relocated to Albany, New York for part of the 1896 season, but started 
and finished the year in Toronto. In 1897, the team began playing its home 
games on the Toronto Islands at Hanlan's Point Stadium. The stadium and 
the team were owned by the Toronto Ferry Company. In 1900, a group of 52 
Toronto businessmen, spearheaded by Ed Barrow and Ed Mack, a tailor and 
former ballplayer, bought the team for CA$6,000.[2] The club constructed 
a new stadium at Liberty Street and Fraser Avenue, called Diamond Park. 
Led by Barrow, the Leafs won the International League pennant in 1902 with 
a record of 85–42. The team faltered after its championship season, falling 
to eighth place by 1905. Debt holders called in their loans and the team 
was purchased by James J. McCaffery, who served as team president from 
1908 until his death in 1922, and Lawrence "Lol" Solman, president from 
1922 to 1931. Former major league star Joe Kelley took the reins as manager 
in 1907 and the team's fortunes immediately turned around. Kelley was drafted 
by the Boston Doves the next season, when the Leafs returned to Hanlan's 
Point Stadium, but Kelley rejoined the club in 1909 and guided the team 
to the championship in 1912. Hanlan's Stadium burned down in August 1909 
and the team had to finish its season back at Diamond Park. In time for 
the 1910 season, a new and larger stadium was ready at Hanlan's Point. 
It would serve as their home until 1926. In 1912, minor league baseball 
was reorganized and a new top level classification, AA, was created. On 
Sept. 5, 1914, soon after Canada entered the First World War, a 19-year-old 
Babe Ruth was pitching for the Providence Grays in a game against the Maple 
Leafs. The Bambino threw a shutout game, beating the Maple Leafs 9-0, but 
most notably, he hit his first professional home run to cash in three of 
those runs.[3] The Eastern League moved up to AA and changed its name to 
become the International League. The Maple Leafs continued as members of 
the International League for the next 55 years, with the league being reclassified 
as Triple A in 1946. Forty-one-year-old Nap Lajoie and his .380 batting 
average helped lead the Maple Leafs to another championship in 1917. Manager 
Dapper Dan Howley first joined the team in 1918, leading the Leafs to the 
pennant that year. Canadian Mooney Gibson became manager in 1919, and was 
called to the major leagues after one season. The 1920 Leafs won 108 games, 
and had what would be the highest single season winning percentage in the 
history of the franchise at .701, but finished second to the powerhouse 
Baltimore Orioles.Through the 1920s, the team averaged 93 wins a season, 
but won only one pennant. In 1926, the Maple Leafs moved to the new Maple 
Leaf Stadium, which would be their home for the next 42 seasons, and capped 
off the season with the championship, with Howley back as manager. The 
following year, the National Hockey League team, the Toronto St. Patricks, 
changed its own nickname to Maple Leafs. The Maple Leafs struggled through 
the 1930s, both on and off the field. In 1931, ownership of Maple Leaf 
Stadium passed to the Toronto Harbour Commission after the club was unable 
to pay taxes and other debts. Shortly after, club president Solman died, 
with George Oakley succeeding him in May 1931. At the same time, J. P. 
Bickell joined the team's board of directors. The 1932 Maple Leafs lost 
113 games and only attracted 50,000 fans through the entire year. James 
A. Dunn, vice-president and second-largest shareholder after Oakley, died 
in August 1933. The one bright spot was 1934, when the team won the league 
championship under manager Ike Boone before losing the Junior World Series 
in nine games. A few months later, in December 1934, Oakley died. After 
George Oakley's death, his son Cliff Oakley succeeded him as team president. 
Following the 1936 season, Oakley publicly commented that baseball was 
in trouble in Toronto and that something would have to change. A few months 
later, he and general manager Leman were approached by Joe Cambria, former 
owner of the Albany Senators, who wanted to buy the team and move it to 
Albany, New York. A group of local investors, headed by stockbroker Percy 
Gardiner and former lieutenant-governor of Ontario William Donald Ross, 
bought the Leafs in January 1937 to keep them in Toronto. Oakley immediately 
stepped down as president and was succeeded by Donald G. Ross, lawyer and 
son of William Donald Ross. Howley was brought back as manager, returning 
to the position he had held three times previously: in 1918, 1923–1926, 
and 1933. The team lost a lot of money, and wasn't very successful on the 
field, drawing about 60,000 paying fans a year during a three-year stretch 
from 1939–1941 when the Leafs finished in eighth place each season. Control 
of the team passed to Peter Campbell, who would be president until his 
death in 1949. The Leafs' .305 winning percentage in 1941 was the lowest 
in franchise history. Campbell negotiated a working agreement with the 
Pittsburgh Pirates in 1942, and a year later the team won the International 
League pennant—its first in 16 years. By 1947, the team was back to eighth 
place. Joe Ziegler then became general manager and is credited with turning 
the team's fortunes around, with such promotional innovations as 20-cent 
hot dogs and Sunday games. Under Ziegler, the Leafs set a new franchise 
attendance record with 353,247 customers in 1949—double what it had been 
two years earlier, despite a fifth-place finish. Ziegler resigned at the 
end of the 1951 season, soon after the team came under new ownership. In 
July 1951, Jack Kent Cooke became the new owner of the Maple Leafs, and 
succeeded Ross as president. Under Cooke's ownership, the Leafs were one 
of the flagship franchises of the IL, leading the league in attendance 
every year from 1952–1956. In his first home game as owner, Cooke offered 
free hot dogs and drinks to everyone in the park. Within a week, he had 
brought in Victor Borge and Gloria DeHaven for guest appearances. At another 
game that week, he provided free orchids from Hawaii to the first 3,000 
women in the park. An opera company and free comic books for children under 
14 were scheduled for another game that week that was rained out. Cooke 
had suggestion boxes installed throughout the stadium and introduced music 
over the public address system between innings. He also announced that 
he would hire female ushers for the next season and hired a flagpole sitter 
who was supposed to remain at the top of the pole until the Leafs made 
the first division. Over the 10-year span from 1951 to 1960, the Maple 
Leafs drew 3.2 million spectators, peaking in 1952 with 446,040 fans in 
attendance (which went to more than 500,000 with the playoffs included) 
to see a team that finished in fourth place. Nine days after Cooke became 
owner, the team announced that it had signed its first African American 
players. Cooke negotiated an affiliation with the St. Louis Browns for 
the 1952 season. With his focus on entertainment, Cooke had often been 
compared to Browns' owner Bill Veeck. The arrangement with the Browns lasted 
only one season. But, despite the strong start, attendance never again 
came close to matching the 1952 numbers, even with pennant-winning seasons 
under managers Luke Sewell in 1954, Bruno Betzel in 1956, and Dixie Walker 
in 1957. The pennant-winning 1960 Leafs, a Cleveland affiliate, won 100 
games with a league-record 32 shutouts under manager Mel McGaha, but attendance 
figures were flat from the previous season, when the Leafs had finished 
in eighth place. It was also in 1960 that Sparky Anderson first joined 
the team as a middle infielder. He went on to play with the Leafs until 
1964 when he became manager. In 1961, Cooke left Canada to become a U.S. 
citizen, naming Harry Kimber club president. Cooke sold the team in January 
1964 to a syndicate led by Robert L. Hunter and Sam Starr for a reported 
$50,000. Former co-owner Gardiner returned to the Leafs as a director. 
Hunter and Starr launched a drive for community ownership, selling shares 
in Toronto (Community) Baseball Ltd., but there was little interest. In 
1965 the Boston Red Sox became the parent club and another future Baseball 
Hall of Fame manager, Dick Williams, replaced Anderson at the Leafs' helm. 
Williams then led them to consecutive Governors' Cup titles in 1965 and 
1966. Despite the championship season, the Leafs lost $168,000 in 1965. 
Gardiner wrote a personal cheque for $100,000 to cover the shortfall, with 
the balance being paid by other members of the board. Meanwhile, the deterioration 
of Maple Leaf Stadium, regular broadcasts of major league games on television, 
and other factors drove attendance down to only 67,216 in 1967. According 
to Hunter, the team lost about $500,000 over its last four seasons in Toronto.[4] 
The final home game, on September 4, 1967, drew a paid attendance of 802. 
During their last season, Hunter was in discussions to sell the club, hoping 
to find an owner to keep the team in Toronto.[5][6] The asking price was 
$60,000.[4] Maple Leaf Gardens Limited, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs 
of the National Hockey League, held negotiations to purchase the club,[4][5][6][7] 
but the deal ultimately fell apart due to concerns about the team's stadium, 
which needed up to $250,000 in repairs and whose owner wanted $4 million 
to purchase it.[4][6] Harold Ballard, part owner of MLGL, said that the 
company's interest was due in part to help position themselves to go after 
a Major League Baseball franchise for Toronto.[4][6] After the season, 
the team was sold to Walter Dilbeck, a real estate developer from Evansville, 
Indiana for $65,000.[7] On October 17, 1967 the directors of the International 
League approved the transfer of the Maple Leafs franchise to Louisville, 
Kentucky, where the team competed as the Louisville Colonels starting in 
1968. After just five seasons, the club moved again, to Pawtucket, Rhode 
Island in 1973, where it continues to operate as the Pawtucket Red Sox. 
In 1969, the year after the demise of the AAA Leafs, a new Toronto Maple 
Leafs began play as an amateur team belonging to the Ontario-only Intercounty 
Baseball League. Major League Baseball arrived in the city of Toronto during 
the next wave of expansion, in 1977, with the Toronto Blue Jays. Toronto 
won the Eastern League/International League pennant 12 times: 1887, 1902, 
1907, 1912, 1917, 1918, 1926, 1943, 1954, 1956, 1957, and 1960. The team 
won the Governors' Cup four times: 1934, 1960, 1965, and 1966 (finalists 
in 1943, 1955, 1956, 1958), and won the Junior World Series in 1907 and 
1926 (finalists in 1917, 1934, and 1960). Members of the Maple Leafs won 
the league batting title 16 times: † Bases on balls counted as hits for
