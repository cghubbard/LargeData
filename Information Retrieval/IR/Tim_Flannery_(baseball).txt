As player As coach Timothy Earl Flannery (born September 29, 1957) is a 
former Major League Baseball player who spent eleven seasons with the San 
Diego Padres, from 1979 to 1989. He was the 3rd base coach of the San Francisco 
Giants from 2007–2014. He is also the nephew of former Major League Baseball 
player Hal Smith.[1] Flannery earned all-league honors while playing for 
Anaheim High School, where he was also elected Homecoming King as a senior. 
He was drafted in the sixth round of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 
by the Padres out of Chapman University in California. Standing at 5'11" 
tall and weighing 175 lbs., Flannery batted left-handed but threw right-handed. 
In his first season in the minors (1978), Flannery batted .350 for the 
California League Reno Silver Sox. In 1979, he batted .345 with six home 
runs and 71 runs batted in to receive a September call-up to the majors. 
Flannery made his major league debut 26 days before his 22nd birthday, 
and was the eighth youngest player in the majors in 1979. He batted lead-off 
and played second base against the San Francisco Giants at Jack Murphy 
Stadium (now Qualcomm Stadium) in his first game on September 3, 1979. 
Flannery was one for three and drove in the second run of the Padres' 3-0 
victory.[2] His minor league success did not translate to major league 
success as he hit just .154 in 65 big league at bats, with his only extra 
base hit of the season being a triple.[3] He split 1980 between the Padres 
and their triple A affiliate, the Hawaii Islanders. With Hawaii, Flannery 
batted .346, however, he hit only .240 in the majors that year. In 1981, 
he only appeared in 37 games and batted .254. Flannery's first full major 
league season without spending any time in the minors was 1982. It wasn't 
until his fifth season, 1983, that Flannery hit his first Major League 
home run—a solo shot off the Chicago Cubs' Chuck Rainey.[4] Flannery reached 
the post-season for the only time in his career in 1984. He made three 
plate appearances in the 1984 National League Championship Series and reached 
base all three times. Trailing 3-2 in game four of the series, Flannery 
hit a lead-off single in the fifth inning, and scored the tying run of 
the Padres' 7-5 victory over the Cubs.[5] In game five, he reached on a 
ground ball that trickled through the legs of Cubs first baseman Leon Durham 
to score the tying run.[6] In his only at-bat in the 1984 World Series, 
Flannery hit an eighth inning pinch hit single off Jack Morris in game 
four.[7] Flannery enjoyed his best year the following season. Having been 
used all over the infield up to this point in his career, he emerged as 
the Padres' regular second baseman in 1985. He batted .281 with 40 RBIs 
and 50 runs scored—all career highs. He was used as a bench player for 
the majority of his career. He played his final big league game on his 
32nd birthday—September 29, 1989.[8] He spent nine seasons with Eric Show—longer 
than any other teammate. Though never a star, Flannery was a fan favorite 
in San Diego for much of his career.[9] Team organist Danny Topaz would 
greet Flannery's plate appearances with the imposing strains of Wagner's 
Ride of the Valkyries.[10] His retirement announcement in 1989 resulted 
in an outpouring of gifts and attention. In his final game, the sellout 
crowd greeted his first plate appearance with a standing ovation so prolonged 
that the umpire had to stop play,[11] and following the game, there was 
discussion on at least one call-in show of whether Flannery's number should 
be retired.[9] After a two-year hiatus from baseball, he became manager 
of the Padres' Northwest League affiliate Spokane Indians in 1993. The 
following season, he led the California League's Rancho Cucamonga Quakes 
to a 77–59 record, and in 1995, he was handed the reins to the triple A 
Las Vegas Stars. In 1996, he became third base coach for the Padres. He 
remained with manager Bruce Bochy's coaching staff through 2002. When Bochy 
was named manager of the San Francisco Giants for the 2007 season, Flannery 
joined him as third base coach for the Giants,[12] where he coached the 
Giants through three World Series wins in 2010, 2012, and 2014. He announced 
his retirement on November 25, 2014, saying "I'm going to send myself home 
safely."[13] On Saturday, September 27, 2008, Flannery changed his number 
to 60 for one game because J. T. Snow came back from retirement and wore 
number 6. Snow was taken out before the first pitch. From 2004 to 2006, 
he was a TV and radio broadcaster for the Padres pre- and post-game shows, 
as well as a color commentator during selected game broadcasts. After he 
ended his coaching stint with the Giants, he started working for CSN Bay 
Area as an analyst on Giants Pregame Live and Giants Postgame Live. He 
was hired as an MLB Network analyst in 2015.[14][15] He and his wife Donna 
have a son and two daughters.[16] He is also a bluegrass musician and has 
released at least a dozen albums since 1997, both solo and with his group, 
The Lunatic Fringe.[17][18] He has sung the National Anthem with Bob Weir 
and Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead several times, including during the 
2012 and 2014 playoffs.[19][20] Flannery has also held benefit concerts 
in support of injured Giants fan Bryan Stow.[21] Flannery later founded
