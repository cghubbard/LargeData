Cuban League records Mexican League records Martín Magdaleno Dihigo Llanos 
(May 25, 1906[1] – May 20, 1971) was a Cuban player in baseball's Negro 
leagues and Latin American leagues who excelled at several positions, primarily 
as a pitcher and second baseman. He was born in the sugarmill Jesús María 
(town of Cidra) in Matanzas Province, Cuba. Dihigo began his professional 
career in the winter of 1922/23 at the age of 16 as a substitute infielder 
for Habana in the Cuban League. His first summer in United States baseball 
came in 1923 as a first baseman for the Negro leagues' Cuban Stars (East). 
He played in the Negro leagues from 1923 through 1936 and again briefly 
in 1945. Over the course of his career, he played all nine positions. As 
a hitter, he led the Negro leagues in home runs in 1926 and 1935. As a 
pitcher, he once defeated Satchel Paige when the latter was touring Cuba. 
Dihigo's career record in twelve seasons in the Negro leagues was a .307 
average and .511 slugging percentage, with 431 hits, 64 home runs, 61 doubles, 
17 triples, 227 RBIs, and 292 runs scored in 1404 at bats. He drew 143 
walks and stole 41 bases. As a pitcher, he went 26–19 with a 2.92 ERA, 
with 176 strikeouts and 80 walks in 354 innings.[2] Although a two-time 
All-Star in the American Negro leagues, Dihigo's greatest season came in 
the Mexican League in 1938, where he went 18-2 with a 0.90 ERA as a pitcher, 
while winning the batting title with a .387 average. In another season 
in the Mexican League, he had a 0.15 ERA. In his Mexican career, he was 
119-57 with a .317 batting average. In the Cuban League, he was 107-56 
with a .298 average. Dihigo continued his playing career in Mexico into 
the early 1950s. He was Cuba's Minister of Sport from 1959 until his death, 
where he was called "The Immortal". In other Latin American countries, 
he was called "El Maestro", translated as "The Master". Combining his Dominican, 
American, Cuban and Mexican statistics results in a lifetime .302 career 
batting average with 130 home runs (eleven seasons worth of home run totals 
are missing) and a 252-132 pitching record. After retiring, Dihigo became 
a radio announcer for the Cuban Winter League. He fled Cuba in 1952 to 
protest the rise of Fulgencio Batista. He managed the Leones del Caracas 
in the 1953 Caribbean Series but finished last. Dihigo returned to Cuba 
when Castro took power, and was appointed the minister of sports. He taught 
programs for amateur baseball players that the new government opened [3][self-published 
source] He died five days before his 65th birthday in Cienfuegos, Cuba. 
Known as a humorous, good-natured man as well as a versatile player, Dihigo 
was elected to the American Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977. Dihigo was also 
inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame.[4] Is 
one of two players (Willie Wells) to be inducted to the American, Cuban 
and Mexican Baseball Halls of Fame, and is also in the Dominican Republic 
and Venezuela Halls of Fame. Martín Dihigo's stature as a ballplayer is 
reflected in this conversation between former Dodgers general manager Al 
Campanis and broadcaster Jaime Jarrín: Martín Dihigo is buried in Cementerio
