Chester County (Chesco) is a county in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. 
As of the 2010 census, the population was 498,886.[2] The county seat is 
West Chester.[3] Chester County was one of the three original Pennsylvania 
counties created by William Penn in 1682. It was named for Chester, England. 
Chester County is part of the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD 
Metropolitan Statistical Area. Eastern Chester County is home to many communities 
that comprise part of the Main Line western suburbs of Philadelphia, while 
part of its southernmost portion is considered suburban Wilmington, along 
with southwest Delaware County. Chester County is the highest-income county 
in Pennsylvania and 24th highest in the nation as measured by median household 
income (as of 2010).[4] Philadelphia, Bucks, and Chester were the three 
Pennsylvania counties initially created by William Penn on August 24, 1682.[5][6] 
At that time, Chester County's borders were Philadelphia County to the 
north, the ill-defined western edge of the colony (approximately the Susquehanna 
River) to the west, the Delaware River to the east, and Delaware and Maryland 
to the south. Chester County replaced the Pennsylvania portion of New Netherland/New 
York’s "Upland", which was officially eliminated when Pennsylvania was 
chartered on March 4, 1681, but did not cease to exist until June of that 
year.[7][8] Much of the Welsh Tract was in eastern Chester County, and 
Welsh place names, given by early settlers, continue to predominate there. 
The fourth county in the state, Lancaster County, was formed from Chester 
County on May 10, 1729. On March 11, 1752, Berks County was formed from 
the northern section of Chester County, as well as parts of Lancaster and 
Philadelphia counties. The original Chester County seat was the city of 
Chester, a center of naval shipbuilding, at the eastern edge of the county. 
In an effort to accommodate the increased population of the western part 
of the county, the county seat was moved to a more central location in 
1788; in order to mollify the eastern portion of the county, the village, 
known as Turk's Head, was renamed West Chester. Apparently, this did not 
work: the eastern portion of the county separated from Chester County on 
September 26, 1789, becoming Delaware County. West Chester remained the 
seat of the reduced Chester County, and still is. Much of the history of 
Chester County arises from its location between Philadelphia and the Susquehanna 
River. The first road to "the West" (meaning Lancaster County) passed through 
the central part of Chester County, following the Great Valley westward; 
with some re-alignments, it became the Lincoln Highway and later U.S. Route 
30. This road is still named Lancaster Avenue in most of the Chester county 
towns it runs through. The first railroad (which became the Pennsylvania 
Railroad) followed much the same route, and the Reading Railroad progressed 
up the Schuylkill River to Reading. Industry tended to concentrate along 
the rail lines. Easy transportation allowed workers to commute to urban 
jobs, and the rise of the suburbs followed. To this day, the developed 
areas form "fingers" extending along major lines of transportation. During 
the American Revolutionary War, the Battle of Brandywine was fought at 
what is now the southeastern fringe of the county. The Valley Forge encampment 
was at the northeastern edge. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the 
county has a total area of 759 square miles (1,970 km2), of which 751 square 
miles (1,950 km2) is land and 8.7 square miles (23 km2) (1.1%) is water.[9] 
The topography consists of rolling hills and valleys and it is part of 
the region known as the Piedmont. Watersheds that serve Chester County 
include the Octoraro, the Brandywine, and Chester creeks, and the Schuylkill 
River. Many of the soils are fertile, rich loam as much as twenty-four 
inches thick; together with the temperate climate, this was long a major 
agricultural area.[citation needed] Because of its proximity to Philadelphia, 
Chester County has seen large waves of development over the past half-century 
due to suburbanization. Although development in Chester County has increased, 
agriculture is still a major part of the county's economy, and the number 
of horse farms is increasing in the county.[citation needed] Mushroom growing 
is a specialty in the southern portion of the county. Elevations (in feet): 
High point—1020 Welsh Mt., Honeybrook Twp. Other high points—960 Thomas 
Hill, Warwick Twp; 960 Barren Hill, West Cain Twp. Low point—66 Schuylkill 
River, Chester-Montgomery county line. Cities and boroughs: Coatesville 
314; Downingtown 255; Kennett Square 300; Oxford 535; Parkesburg 542; Phoenixville 
127; Spring City 114; West Chester 459.[10] As of the 2010 census, the 
county was 82.1% White Non-Hispanic, 6.1% Black or African American, 0.2% 
Native American or Alaskan Native, 3.9% Asian, 0.0% Native Hawaiian, 1.8% 
were two or more races, and 2.4% were some other race. 6.5% of the population 
were Hispanic or Latino. As of the census[16] of 2000, there were 433,501 
people, 157,905 households, and 113,375 families residing in the county. 
The population density was 573 people per square mile (221/km²). There 
were 163,773 housing units at an average density of 217 per square mile 
(84/km²). The racial makeup of the county was 89.21% White, 6.24% Black 
or African American, 0.15% Native American, 1.95% Asian, 0.03% Pacific 
Islander, 1.35% from other races, and 1.06% from two or more races. 3.72% 
of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 18.0% were of Irish, 
17.3% German, 13.1% Italian, 10.1% English and 5.6% American ancestry according 
to their self-reporting on Census 2000. 91.4% spoke English and 3.7% Spanish 
as their first language. There were 157,905 households out of which 35.10% 
had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.50% were married 
couples living together, 8.10% had a female householder with no husband 
present, and 28.20% were non-families. 22.60% of all households were made 
up of individuals and 7.60% had someone living alone who was 65 years of 
age or older. The average household size was 2.65 and the average family 
size was 3.15. In the county, the population was spread out with 26.20% 
under the age of 18, 7.90% from 18 to 24, 30.40% from 25 to 44, 23.80% 
from 45 to 64, and 11.70% who were 65 years of age or older. The median 
age was 37 years. For every 100 females there were 96.40 males. For every 
100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.10 males. The median income 
for a household in the county was $65,295, and the median income for a 
family was $76,916 (these figures had risen to $80,818 and $97,894 respectively 
as of a 2007 estimate).[17] Males had a median income of $51,223 versus 
$34,854 for females. The per capita income for the county was $31,627. 
About 3.10% of families and 5.20% of the population were below the poverty 
line, including 5.10% of those under age 18 and 5.50% of those age 65 or 
over. The region was originally occupied by the Lenni Lenape people, who 
greeted European settlers in the seventeenth century with amity and kindness. 
British settlers were mostly English, Scotch-Irish and Welsh in ethnicity. 
From the late 19th to early 20th century, the industrial areas of the region, 
such as Coatesville, attracted immigrants and job seekers from Germany 
and Ireland, Eastern Europe, Italy, and the American rural South, with 
both black and white migrants coming north. Later Hispanic immigrants have 
included Puerto Ricans and, most recently, Mexicans. Long a primarily rural 
area, Chester County is now the fastest-growing county in the Delaware 
Valley; it is one of the fastest growing in the entire Northeastern section 
of the United States. In keeping with its colonial history, Chester County 
is home to a number of historic Quaker buildings, including Birmingham, 
Birmingham Orthodox, Bradford, Caln, Old Kennett, Parkersville, and Uwchlan 
meeting houses. Other historic religious buildings include St. Malachi 
Church, southeastern Pennsylvania's oldest active Catholic mission church, 
and the Episcopal St. Mary's, St. Paul's, and St. Peter's churches, and 
Washington Memorial Chapel. Also located in the county are the First Presbyterian 
Church of West Chester, Coventryville United Methodist Church, which is 
part of the Coventryville Historic District, and Beth Israel Congregation 
of Chester County, a Conservative synagogue in Coatesville, a site of Eastern 
European immigration in the 20th century. As of November 2013, there are 
337,793 registered voters in Chester County.[18] Chester County has historically 
been reliably Republican at the county level; traditionally, it was the 
most conservative county on the Philadelphia side of Pennsylvania. In recent 
federal elections, however, it has been trending Democratic, though not 
as overwhelmingly as the rest of the Philadelphia suburbs. In 2000 Al Gore 
lost it by almost 10 percent but in 2004 George W. Bush defeated John Kerry 
by a much smaller margin of only 4.5 percent. Bob Casey, Jr. carried it 
by 10% when he unseated incumbent Republican US Senator Rick Santorum in 
2006. In 2008, Chester County sided with the rest of Pennsylvania and voted 
for Barack Obama by a much larger margin of 9%, making him the first Democrat 
to carry it in a Presidential election since 1964. But, in 2009, with a 
smaller turnout, Republican candidates swept all county-row offices, winning 
with an average margin of 20%. In 2012 the county voted for Republican 
candidate Mitt Romney, by a very small margin of about 500 votes.[citation

in recent elections. Democrat Andy Dinniman picked up the 19th Senate District 
in May 2006 in the special election to replace the late Robert Thompson. 
Democrat Barbara McIlvaine Smith picked up the open 156th House district 
in November 2006, winning by 28 votes and tipping the State-House majority 
to the Democrats. This was the first time that a Democrat had served part 
of Chester County as State Representative since Jim Gerlach (now serving 
the majority of the county in Congress) unseated Sam Morris in 1990. In 
2008, two more open House seats in the county went Democratic—to Tom Houghton 
in the 13th and Paul Drucker in the 157th. In 2010, however, Chester County 
swung back to the GOP, with Republicans Dan Truitt (who defeated McIlvaine 
Smith), Warren Kampf (who defeated Drucker), and John Lawrence (who defeated 
Houghton) all elected to the State House.[citation needed] Chester County 
is administered by a three-person Board of Commissioners, who serve four-year 
terms. Elections occur in the odd-numbered years that precede U.S. Presidential 
elections, with the next election falling in 2019. The Commissioners have 
selective policy-making authority to provide certain local services and 
facilities on a county-wide basis. Accordingly, the commissioners are responsible 
for the management of the fiscal and administrative functions of the county. 
There are 11 public cyber charter schools and 144 bricks and mortar charter 
schools in Pennsylvania that are available for free statewide, to children 
K-12. See: Education in Pennsylvania.[19] The Chester County Library System 
in southeastern Pennsylvania was organized in 1965. It is a federated system 
composed of a District Center Library in Exton and sixteen member libraries. 
The system provides materials and information for life, work and pleasure. 
Under Pennsylvania law, there are four types of incorporated municipalities: 
cities, boroughs, townships, and, in at most two cases, towns. The post 
office uses community names and boundaries that usually do not correspond 
to the townships, and usually only have the same names as the municipalities 
for the cities and boroughs. The names used by the post office are generally 
used by residents to describe where they live. The following cities, boroughs 
and townships are located in Chester County: Census-designated places are 
geographical areas designated by the U.S. Census Bureau for the purposes 
of compiling demographic data. They are not actual jurisdictions under 
Pennsylvania law. The population ranking of the following table is based
