Melvin Leroy Harder (October 15, 1909 – October 20, 2002), nicknamed "Chief", 
was an American right-handed starting pitcher, coach and manager in Major 
League Baseball, who played his entire career with the Cleveland Indians. 
He spent 36 seasons overall with the Indians, as a player from 1928 to 
1947 and as one of the game's most highly regarded pitching coaches from 
1948 to 1963. He set franchise records for wins (223), games started (433) 
and innings pitched (3426-1/3) which were later broken by Bob Feller, and 
still holds the club record of 582 career games pitched; he was among the 
American League's career leaders in wins (9th), games (8th) and starts 
(10th) when he retired. He was also an excellent fielder, leading the AL 
in putouts four times, then a record. Harder was born in Beemer, Nebraska, 
and graduated from Tech High School in North Omaha, Nebraska. He broke 
in with the Indians as a relief pitcher in 1928. His pitching style revolved 
around his fine curveball, a hard fastball and excellent control. He joined 
the starting rotation in 1930, and posted a record of 39–37 from 1930 to 
1932; on July 31, 1932, he pitched the first game ever at Cleveland Municipal 
Stadium. In 1933 he finished second in the AL with an earned run average 
of 2.95, trailing teammate Monte Pearson (2.33); under modern rules (one 
inning pitched per games played by team), enacted in 1951, Harder would 
have been credited with the league lead, as Pearson only pitched 135 innings. 
In 1934 he finished with 20 wins, led the league with six shutouts, and 
was again second in ERA (2.61) to Lefty Gómez. In 1935 he was second to 
Wes Ferrell in wins (22) and innings (287-1/3), and was fifth in the AL 
with a 3.29 ERA. After developing a sore elbow and bursitis in his shoulder, 
he won at least fifteen games each season from 1936 to 1939; he led the 
AL in putouts in 1932, 1933, 1935 and 1938. Harder was one of the most 
successful All-Stars of the 1930s, appearing in all four games from 1934 
to 1937, and setting a record with 13 consecutive innings without an earned 
run. He won the 1934 All-Star game after relieving Red Ruffing with none 
out and two men on in the fifth inning, with an 8–6 lead; one run scored 
on a double steal, but Harder allowed only one hit in his five innings 
as the AL won 9–7. He earned a save in the 1935 game, pitching three scoreless 
innings to finish a 4–1 victory, and another in 1937 with three shutout 
innings in the 8–3 win; he also finished the 4–3 loss played at Cleveland 
in 1936 with two innings. In 1940, he posted a 12–11 record, as the Indians 
finished one game behind the pennant-winning Detroit Tigers, wasting an 
early September lead amid clubhouse rancor; it would be the only season 
in his career in which the Indians came within ten games of the AL flag. 
After several more years in which his record hovered near .500, earning 
his 200th victory in 1944, Harder ended his career in 1947 with 1160 strikeouts 
and a 3.80 ERA. In addition to his 223 victories, his 186 losses remain 
a club record. Ironically, the Indians won the World Series the year after 
he retired. From 1948 into the 1950s, he guided what became known as the 
Indians' "Big Four" pitching rotation, featuring Feller, Bob Lemon, Early 
Wynn and Mike Garcia; Harder had successfully transformed Lemon from an 
infielder into a top pitcher while working with him in the mid-1940s, and 
he taught Wynn the breaking ball and changeup. In 1953, Lemon tied Harder's 
record by leading the AL in putouts for the fourth time, and he broke the 
record the following year as the Indians won another pennant, but lost 
to the underdog New York Giants in the World Series. Herb Score was named 
the AL's Rookie of the Year in 1955 after Harder helped to develop his 
curveball. During his coaching career, Harder served as interim manager 
of the Indians for the last game of the 1961 season and the last two games 
of 1962, winning all three contests. Late in his tenure, prominent young 
pitchers as Sam McDowell, Tommy John and Luis Tiant would come under his 
guidance. He was fired after the 1963 season, having spent the first 36 
years of his adult life in Cleveland. He later coached with the New York 
Mets (1964), Chicago Cubs (1965), Cincinnati Reds (1966–68) and Kansas 
City Royals (1969). Cleveland retired his pitching uniform number 18 on 
July 28, 1990 (he wore 43 and 2 as a coach), and he was named one of the 
Indians' top 100 players in 2001.[1] In 2002, Harder died in Chardon, Ohio 
at age 93;[2] at the time of his death, he had been one of only five living
