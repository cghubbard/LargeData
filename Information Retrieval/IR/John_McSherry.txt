John Patrick McSherry (September 11, 1944 – April 1, 1996) was an American 
umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the National League from 
1971 to 1996. McSherry wore uniform number 9 when he entered the National 
League, then wore number 10 from 1979 through the rest of his career. A 
respected arbiter, he was one of several umpires who were noticeably overweight. 
McSherry was officially listed at 6'2" (188 cm) and 328 pounds (149 kg), 
but some sources placed his true weight close to 400 pounds (180 kg). His 
weight may have been a major factor in causing his sudden cardiac death, 
which occurred behind home plate during the opening game of the 1996 major 
league season in Cincinnati on April 1, 1996. Born in New York City, McSherry 
umpired in the World Series in 1977 and 1987. He also officiated in the 
National League Championship Series in 1974, 1978, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1988, 
1990, and 1992, and in the National League Division Series in 1981 and 
1995. McSherry worked the 1975, 1982, and 1991 All-Star Games, for which 
the umpiring crew consisted of three American League umpires and three 
National League umpires during the years 1949 to 1999. As Cincinnati was 
the home of baseball's first professional team, the 1869 Cincinnati Red 
Stockings, the Reds traditionally played the first game of the major league 
season at home. On April 1, 1996, the Reds were playing the Montreal Expos, 
and McSherry was assigned to work home plate. Seven pitches into the game, 
McSherry called a timeout, spoke briefly to Reds catcher Eddie Taubensee, 
and walked slowly towards the Reds' dugout. Moments after signaling for 
the second base umpire to come in and replace him, McSherry stumbled and 
collapsed. Resuscitative efforts were begun on McSherry and he was taken 
to University Hospital in Cincinnati, but he was pronounced dead within 
the hour. He was 51 years old. Third-base umpire Tom Hallion had followed 
the ambulance to the hospital, leaving umpires Steve Rippley and Jerry 
Crawford to decide whether to proceed with the game. Shaken and tearful 
players on both teams consoled the grieving umpires, and ultimately it 
was decided that it would be best to postpone the game. Reds manager Ray 
Knight recalled a comment from shortstop Barry Larkin: "Barry told me very 
quietly and with very much emotion: 'Ray, I've had a lot of deaths in my 
family. In good conscience, out of respect for life, I can't go out there.'"[3] 
Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott was quoted as having said, "Snow this 
morning and now this. I don't believe it. I feel cheated. This isn't supposed 
to happen to us, not in Cincinnati. This is our history, our tradition, 
our team. Nobody feels worse than me." Schott's statement was criticized 
as a public gaffe, though supporters contended that she was thinking of 
the some 50,000 fans who had expected to see a baseball game and might 
be unable to attend a makeup game. Schott sent flowers to the umpire dressing 
room, but a story in the Dayton Daily News later said that the flowers 
had been given to Schott on Opening Day by Reds television affiliate WLWT 
in Cincinnati. According to the story, Schott hastily wrote a sympathy 
note and attached it to the flowers.[4] The next day, the Reds defeated 
the Expos 4-1. Rich Rieker joined the umpiring crew as an emergency replacement 
at third base. McSherry's funeral was held at St. Nicholas of Tolentine 
Catholic Church in the Bronx, and he was interred in the Gate of Heaven 
Cemetery.[5] It was later revealed that McSherry had a doctor's appointment 
for the day after his death; McSherry had been diagnosed with a cardiac 
arrhythmia.[6] After the incident, Major League Baseball compelled its 
umpires to be more physically fit. NL umpire Eric Gregg, who was likely 
as heavy as McSherry, made an effort to lose excess weight via exercise 
and diet, but he resigned after the 1999 season in a dispute with the MLB. 
Any weight that Gregg lost was gained back in his retirement. He died at 
age 55 on June 5, 2006 after suffering a stroke. The New York Mets honored 
McSherry's memory by embroidering "J.M. N.L. Umpire 10" in a home plate 
crossed by two baseball bats on the right sleeves of their 1996 game jerseys.[7] 
In memory of McSherry, the Reds dedicated Riverfront Stadium's umpires'
