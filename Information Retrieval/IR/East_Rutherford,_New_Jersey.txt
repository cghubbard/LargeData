East Rutherford is a borough in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. 
As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 8,913,[8][9][10] 
reflecting an increase of 197 (+2.3%) from the 8,716 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 814 (+10.3%) from the 7,902 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[18] It is an inner-ring suburb of New York City, located 
7 miles (11 km) west of Midtown Manhattan. Under the terms of an act of 
the New Jersey Legislature on April 17, 1889, a portion of the old Union 
Township was incorporated under the name of Boiling Springs Township.[19] 
The new township took its name from a spring in the community. On March 
28, 1894, the Borough of East Rutherford was created, based on the results 
of a referendum held the previous day, and Boiling Springs Township was 
dissolved.[19] While there was no change in its borders, the name and form 
of government were changed.[19][20] The borough was the second formed during 
the "Boroughitis" phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 
26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone.[21] East Rutherford 
is the home of the Meadowlands Sports Complex, which includes the Izod 
Center, the former home of the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball 
Association and the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League, and 
the Ticket-City Legends Classic and Fordham Rams basketball as well as 
concerts and other events; and MetLife Stadium, home of the National Football 
League's New York Giants and New York Jets and the site of Super Bowl XLVIII, 
which made East Rutherford the smallest city ever to host a Super Bowl, 
as well as the former site of Giants Stadium, which hosted the Giants, 
Jets and the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer. East Rutherford 
is the only municipality with fewer than 10,000 residents to have been 
home to five professional sports teams simultaneously.[22] The borough 
is the site of the American Dream Meadowlands project, a large planned 
shopping center and entertainment complex that was originally named "Xanadu". 
If it were to be completed it would be the second largest mall in the state 
behind the Westfield Garden State Plaza. Triple Five Group took control 
of the project in August 2013, but faces lawsuits from the Giants and Jets, 
who claim that the increased traffic on game days will cause disruptions 
that violate their agreements with the original developer of the complex.[23] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area 
of 4.052 square miles (10.494 km2), including 3.709 square miles (9.606 km2) 
of land and 0.343 square miles (0.889 km2) of water (8.47%).[1][2] East

Borough form of New Jersey municipal government. The governing body consists 
of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising six council members, with all 
positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November 
general election. A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year 
term of office. The Borough Council consists of six members elected to 
serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for 
election each year in a three-year cycle.[6] The Borough form of government 
used by East Rutherford, the most common system used in the state, is a 
"weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as 
the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only 
in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override 
by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee 
and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are 
made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.[41][42] As

whose term of office ends December 31, 2019.[3] The borough council members
