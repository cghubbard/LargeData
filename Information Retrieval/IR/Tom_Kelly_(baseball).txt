As Player As Manager Jay Thomas Kelly (born August 15, 1950) is the former 
manager of the Minnesota Twins baseball team from 1986 to 2001. Currently, 
he serves as a Special Assistant to the General Manager for the Twins. 
Kelly grew up in Sayreville, New Jersey and attended St. Mary's High School 
in nearby South Amboy.[1] Kelly was drafted by the Seattle Pilots in the 
8th round of the 1968 Major League Baseball draft. After three unspectacular 
years in the Pilots/Milwaukee Brewers organization, he was given his unconditional 
release on 6 April 1971. On 28 April 1971, Kelly was signed as a minor 
league free agent by the Twins and sent to the AA Charlotte Hornets in 
the South Atlantic League. From 1972 through 1975, Kelly would spend most 
of his playing time at AAA Tacoma Twins in the Pacific Coast League, splitting 
time between first base and the corner outfield positions. After starting 
the 1975 season again in Tacoma, Kelly was called up to the big club and 
would make his major league debut on 11 May 1975. Kelly would play in 49 
games with the Twins over the 1975 season while seeing playing time at 
first base and the outfield. Prior to the start of the 1976 season, Kelly 
was purchased from the Twins by the Baltimore Orioles and assigned to Rochester 
Red Wings; he would not return to the major leagues. In 1977, he returned 
to the Twins organization and AAA Tacoma – this time as a player-manager. 
In 1978, Kelly played for the Twins new AAA affiliate, the Toledo Mudhens, 
spending his last year as a full-time player. Following the 1978 season, 
Kelly was sent down to manage the Twins A-affiliate, the Visalia Oaks in 
the California League, staying there through the 1980 season. After taking 
a year off, Kelly was named the manager of the Twins AA affiliate, the 
Orlando Twins, for the 1982 season. In 1983, Kelly was added to manager 
Billy Gardner's big-league coaching staff where he would remain until being 
named Twins manager during the 1986 season. Kelly was the 11th manager 
of the team and his tenure as manager was the longest in team history. 
Under his tenure, the Twins won two World Series crowns in the span of 
five years (1987 and 1991); however, from 1994 to 1997 a long sequence 
of retirements and injuries (including superstars Kent Hrbek and Kirby 
Puckett) hurt the team badly, and Kelly spent the remainder of his managerial 
career rebuilding the Twins. In 1998, management cleared out the team of 
all of its players earning over 1 million dollars (except for pitcher Brad 
Radke) and rebuilt from the ground up; the team went 70–92 and in fourth 
place in the AL Central, 19 games behind the Cleveland Indians and five 
games ahead of the Detroit Tigers. A run of eight consecutive losing seasons 
ended in 2001, when the Twins led the division for much of the year before 
fading, finishing at 85–77, second to Cleveland. He then resigned at age 
51, citing burnout, and the threat of contraction. Kelly was succeeded 
as manager of the Twins by Ron Gardenhire, and his rebuilding efforts paid 
off the year after he retired from the Twins, with a repeat of divisional 
championships in 2002, 2003, and 2004. The Minnesota Twins announced on 
January 26, 2012 that they would retire Tom Kelly's jersey number, No. 
10, before a September 8, 2012 game.[2] A year after taking over the reins 
of the Twins from Ray Miller, Kelly took the team that he had helped build 
through his role as one of the top people in the Twins' minor league organization 
and led it to a World Series championship. Though the '87 Twins were criticized 
for being the top team in a weak division (amassing only a .525 record 
in regular season play, which was the worst winning percentage for an eventual 
World Champion until surpassed by the St. Louis Cardinals in 2006), they 
easily handled the Detroit Tigers in five games, losing only Game 3 of 
the American League Championship Series to a heartbreaking 8th-inning two-run 
home run. The World Series was a well-fought contest between the Twins 
and the National League champion St. Louis Cardinals, each team winning 
all of its home games. Games 1, 2, 4 and 6 were decidedly lopsided contests 
(10–1 Twins, 8–4 Twins, 7–2 Cards, 11–5 Twins), with Games 3, 5 and 7 being 
much closer contests, each being decided by only two runs (3–1 Cards, 4–2 
Cards and 4–2 Twins). After a 63-year drought, Tom Kelly's leadership helped 
propel the Twins to their second World Championship (the first coming in 
1924 as the Washington Senators). After finishing the 1990 season in last 
place, the Twins dominated the AL West in 1991, finishing 8 games ahead 
of the second-place Chicago White Sox with a record of 95–67. In the AL 
Championship, the Twins easily defeated the Toronto Blue Jays in 5 games, 
winning the right to face the Atlanta Braves in the World Series. Marked 
by a series of close contests filled with dramatic plays and extra-innings, 
the 1991 World Series would later be ranked by ESPN as the greatest World 
Series ever.[3] Following two closely contested victories at home, the 
Twins traveled to Atlanta where they suffered three straight defeats. Tom 
Kelly, prior to the Series' move to Atlanta, infamously suggested that 
managing without the designated hitter was "right up there with rocket 
science".[4] Although he was being facetious, the grueling Game 3 proved 
Kelly prescient as a series of double switches and substitutions emptied 
the Twins' bench and both teams' bullpens. Kelly was forced to pinch hit 
Rick Aguilera in the top of the twelfth and was prepared to send outfielder 
Dan Gladden to the mound if necessary; however, the Braves won in the bottom 
of the twelfth when David Justice narrowly beat a throw to the plate. After 
a similarly close Game 4 and a dominating 14–5 Braves victory in Game 5, 
the Twins had to win the final two games at home. Game 6 featured two climactic 
plays by Kirby Puckett who, in the top of the 3rd, made a sensational leaping 
catch against the center field acrylic glass to prevent a Braves' run. 
The Twins won 4–3 in the bottom of the 11th when Puckett blasted a home 
run off Charlie Leibrandt. Game 7 proved to be one of the greatest games 
in baseball history, as the game remained scoreless for 9 innings and included 
a number of decisive and memorable plays. Twins starter Jack Morris argued 
repeatedly with Kelly to allow him to stay in the game and pitched 10 scoreless 
innings before the Twins won in the bottom of the 10th, giving Minnesota
