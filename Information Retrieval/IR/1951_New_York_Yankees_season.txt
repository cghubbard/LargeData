The 1951 New York Yankees season was the 49th season for the team in New 
York, and its 51st season overall. The team finished with a record of 98â€“56, 
winning their 18th pennant, finishing five games ahead of the Cleveland 
Indians. New York was managed by Casey Stengel. The Yankees played at Yankee 
Stadium. In the World Series, they defeated the New York Giants in 6 games. 
This year was noted for a "changing of the guard" for the Yankees, as it 
was Joe DiMaggio's final season[1] and Mickey Mantle's first. The 1951 
season also marked the first year of Bob Sheppard's long tenure as Yankee 
Stadium's public address announcer. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders
