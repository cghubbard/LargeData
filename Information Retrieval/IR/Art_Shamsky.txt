As Player As Manager Arthur Louis Shamsky (born October 14, 1941) is a 
former Major League Baseball player. He played right field, left field, 
and first base from 1965 to 1972 for the Cincinnati Reds, New York Mets, 
Chicago Cubs, and Oakland Athletics. In 2007 he was the manager of the 
Modi'in Miracle of the Israel Baseball League. Shamsky is Jewish and was 
born in St. Louis.[1][2] He attended University City High School in St. 
Louis and played on the school's baseball team as did fellow major leaguer 
and Israel Baseball League manager Ken Holtzman four years later.[3] After 
playing ball for the University of Missouri in 1958–59, he was signed by 
Cincinnati as a free agent in 1959. Shamsky began his professional baseball 
career in 1960 with the Geneva Redlegs of the New York–Penn League. He 
finished the season with a .271 batting average and 18 homers (second in 
the league), and was named to the All-Star team.[4] He played with the 
Topeka Reds in 1961 (hit .288 with 15 home runs) and the Georgia Peaches 
in 1962 (hit .284 with 16 home runs). Shamsky played with the AAA San Diego 
Padres in 1963 and 1964, where he hit .267 with 18 home runs his first 
year and .272 with 25 home runs his second year.[4] In 1965, Shamsky made 
the Cincinnati Reds out of spring training as a sub and hit .260. Shamsky 
tied a major league record by homering in 4 consecutive at bats for the 
Reds on August 12 and 14, 1966. The first three home runs were hit in a 
game in which he was inserted in the eighth inning as part of a double 
switch.[5] He homered in the bottom half of that inning and remained in 
the game to hit home runs in his next two extra-inning at bats, extending 
the game each time. The feat made Shamsky the first player in Reds history 
to hit two home runs in extra innings in one game. He is also the only 
player in Major League history to hit three home runs in a game in which 
he was not in the starting lineup. The fourth home run was hit as a pinch 
hitter in the next game.[6] His bat from that day is on display in Baseball's 
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.[4] He finished the year with 21 
HR (2nd on the team) and 47 RBIs, and a .521 slugging percentage, in only 
234 at-bats. Shamsky was traded to the New York Mets for Bob Johnson before 
the 1968 season. He initially found living in New York City to be intimidating, 
but eventually he "fell in love with the energy, got to know the city a 
bit. My life changed."[7] He became a favorite of Jewish fans in New York.[8] 
In 1969 Shamsky hit .300, with a .375 on-base percentage, as half of a 
right field platoon with Ron Swoboda for the World Champion Mets. Shamsky 
was the regular starter against right-handed pitchers, with Swoboda starting 
against lefties. He batted .385 as a pinch hitter, and .388 in games that 
were late and close.[9] He still gets comments about his decision not to 
play on Yom Kippur that year. "The funny thing was, the Mets won both ends 
of a double header" that day, he later said.[7] Shamsky's torrid hitting 
continued into the post-season. He started all three games of the NLCS, 
where he batted .538, leading all batters. In the World Series, Shamsky 
started only in Game 3, which was played on his 28th birthday. In 1970 
he hit .293 with a .371 on-base percentage. Despite only 402 at bats, he 
was 7th in the league with 13 intentional walks. He remained with the Mets 
until 1972, when he played 22 games for the Chicago Cubs and Oakland A's. 
A chronic back injury was a factor in his decision to retire in 1972 after 
13 years in pro baseball, with 68 homers and a World Series ring.[8] Shamsky 
is a member of the New York Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. He was inducted 
into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1994. Shamsky was the Manager 
of the Modi'in Miracle in the 2007 first season of the Israel Baseball 
League.[10] Shamsky faced Ken Holtzman as opposing managers for the first 
all star game of the Israel Baseball League.[3] The Miracle finished the 
inaugural 2007 season 22–19 (.537), in third place, and after upsetting 
the # 2 Tel Aviv Lightning in the semi-finals, lost to the Bet Shemesh 
Blue Sox 3–0 in the championship game. The Israel Baseball League did not 
resume play after 2007. After his baseball career, Shamsky became a real 
estate consultant with First Realty Reserve and a sports radio and television 
broadcaster for WFAN,[11] WNYW television, ESPN television, WNEW television 
Channel 5 in New York City, as well as a play-by-play and color commentator 
for the New York Mets on radio and television. In addition, he hosted a 
talk show on WFAN Sports Radio, and has written featured guest editorials 
for the sports section of The New York Times.[12] He owns a New York restaurant, 
"Legends." He has written a book, The Magnificent Seasons: How the Jets, 
Mets, and Knicks Made Sports History and Uplifted a City and the Country, 
with Barry Zeman (Thomas Dunne Books). The book is about the New York Jets, 
New York Mets, and New York Knicks all winning championships for the first 
time in 1969 and 1970.[6] He appeared as himself in a 1999 episode of Everybody 
Loves Raymond along with several other members of the 1969 Mets.[13] As 
of 2007, he was embroiled in a divorce from his second wife, Kim Shamsky, 
whom he had married in 1994 in Saint John in the Virgin Islands.[14][15] 
As of 2004[update], he worked at Bravo Properties in South Orange, New 
Jersey.[7] In the American sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond, Ray and Robert's 
childhood bulldog was named Shamsky after the player. As an adult, Robert 
named his new bulldog Shamsky Number 2. Shamsky made an appearance in this 
series as himself ('Big Shots' – Season 3, Episode 19).[6] Comedian Jon 
Stewart named one of his pit bulls Shamsky, after the player.[16] Ruttman,
