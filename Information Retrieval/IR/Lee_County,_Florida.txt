Lee County is a county in the State of Florida. As of the 2010 census, 
the population was 618,754.[1] The county seat is Fort Myers,[2] and the 
largest city is Cape Coral. Lee County comprises the Cape Coral–Fort Myers, 
FL Metropolitan Statistical Area. Lee County was created in 1887 from Monroe 
County.[3] It was named for Robert E. Lee, Confederate general in the American 
Civil War.[4] Incorporated in 1886, Fort Myers is the center of a popular 
tourist area in Southwest Florida and the seat of Lee County. It is about 
120 miles (190 km) south of Tampa at the meeting point of the Gulf of Mexico 
and the Caloosahatchee River. Fort Myers was the frequent winter home of 
Thomas Edison, as well as Henry Ford.[5] Lee County has been the host to 
several Major League Baseball teams for Spring Training, over the past 
several decades. Currently, it is the spring home of the Boston Red Sox, 
as well as the Minnesota Twins. Fort Myers, built in 1850 as a military 
fort to fend off Seminole Indians, was named after Col. Abraham C. Myers, 
who was stationed in Florida for seven years and was the son-in-law of 
the fort’s establisher and commander. In 1858, after years of elusive battle, 
chief Billy Bowlegs and his warriors were persuaded to surrender and move 
west, and the fort was abandoned. Billy’s Creek, which flows into the Caloosahatchee 
River, was named after a temporary camp where Billy Bowlegs and his men 
awaited ships to take them west. In 1863, the fort was reoccupied by Federal 
troops during the Civil War. In 1865 the fort was attacked unsuccessfully 
by a small group of Confederates. After the war, the fort was again deserted. 
The first settlers arrived in 1866, but it was not until 1882 when the 
city experienced a significant influx of settlers. By 1885, when Fort Myers 
was incorporated, it was the second largest city only to Tampa on Florida’s 
west coast south of Cedar Key, even larger than Clearwater and Sarasota, 
also growing cities at the time. Fort Myers first became a nationally known 
winter resort with the building of The Royal Palm Hotel in 1898. But what 
really sparked the city’s growth was the construction of the Tamiami Trail 
Bridge built across the Caloosahatchee River in 1924. After the bridge’s 
construction, the city experienced its first real estate boom and many 
subdivisions sprouted around the city. In the 1870’s, Tervio Padilla, a 
wealthy merchant from the Canary Islands, came by way of Key West to Cayo 
Costa and established trade with natives and “ranchos” that extended northward 
to Charlotte Harbor. His ships often made port at Cayo Costa at the entrance 
to the harbor. Enchanted by the tropical island, he eventually decided 
to settle there. Padilla prospered until the outbreak of the Spanish-American 
War when his fleet was burned and scuttled. He then turned to another means 
of livelihood – fishing. When the government claimed his land he was disinclined 
to set up another ranch so moved with his wife further down the island 
and as before, simply homesteaded . The Padilla family is one of the first 
pioneer families of Lee County and many still reside within the county 
mainly around the Pine Island area. In 1923, Collier and Hendry Counties 
were created by splitting these areas from Lee County. On August 13, 2004, 
the county was struck by Hurricane Charley, a Category 4 storm, particularly 
on the northwestern islands of Captiva, Gasparilla and North Captiva. According 
to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,212 square 
miles (3,140 km2), of which 785 square miles (2,030 km2) is land and 428 
square miles (1,110 km2) (35.3%) is water.[6] Rivers and streams include 
the Caloosahatchee River, the Imperial River, the Estero River, Hendry 
Creek, and Orange River. Lee County is on the southwest coast of Florida. 
It is approximately 125 miles (201 km) south of Tampa and 115 miles (185 km) 
west of Fort Lauderdale via Interstate 75; and approximately 125 miles 
(201 km) west-northwest of Miami via U.S. Highway 41. Lee County has a 
year-round warm, monsoon-influenced climate that is close to the boundary 
between tropical and subtropical climates (18 °C (64 °F) in the coldest 
month), and is thus either classified as a humid subtropical climate (Köppen 
Cfa), which is the classification used by NOAA,[7][8] or a tropical savanna 
climate (Köppen Aw).[9] Lee County has short, warm winters, and long, hot, 
humid summers, with most of the year's rainfall falling from June to September. 
The temperature rarely rises to 100 °F (38 °C) or lowers to the freezing 
mark.[10] At 89, Lee County leads the nation in the number of days annually 
in which a thunderstorm is close enough for thunder to be heard.[11] The 
monthly daily average temperature ranges from 64.2 °F (17.9 °C) in January 
to 83.4 °F (28.6 °C) in August, with the annual mean being 75.1 °F (23.9 °C). 
Records range from 24 °F (−4 °C) on December 29, 1894 up to 103 °F (39 °C) 
on June 16–17, 1981.[10] U.S. Census Bureau 2010 Ethnic/Race Demographics:[17][18]

6 types of doctoral degrees.[25] The Lee County Library System has 13 branches.[26] 
The town of Fort Myers Beach, though located in Lee County, maintains its 
own independent public library.[27] The Lee County Library System was established 
September 23, 1964, though the first library located in the county was 
built in 1909 in Alva, Florida.[28] The first library in Fort Myers' was 
founded thanks to the help of Olive Stout, who also helped run the Fort 
Myers News Press for 27 years.[29] As of September 2014, the library system 
turned 50 years old. The Lakes Regional Branch was erected in 2005 and 
is currently one of the largest locations of any library in Fort Myers 
at 50,000 square feet.[30] In December 13, 2013, the most current location 
of the Library System was built. Fort Myers Regional Library in Downtown 
was originally built June 18, 1979. The building was relocated in the same 
area and rebuilt.[31] The area is represented in the United States House 
of Representatives by Curt Clawson, 19th district, and by Tom Rooney, 17th 
district. A small port operation continues in Boca Grande, being used as 
a way-point for oil distribution. However, Port Boca Grande has been in 
decline for many years as the shipping industry has moved north, especially 
to the Port of Tampa. In addition, a private enterprise operates a high-speed 
passenger-only ferry service between Fort Myers Beach From San Carlos Island 
and Key West. Another ferry service is offered from Fort Myers to Key West 
Fixed-route bus service is provided by the Lee County Transit Department, 
operated as "LeeTran". Several routes extend outward from the Downtown 
Intermodal Transfer Center; in addition, suburb-to-suburb routes are operated, 
as well as park-and-ride service to and from both Fort Myers Beach and 
Southwest Florida International Airport. The Downtown Intermodal Transfer 
Center in Fort Myers also serves as an intermediate stop on Greyhound Lines 
bus service. Newspapers include The News-Press, Florida Weekly and Naples 
Daily News. Arbitron standard radio market: Ft Myers-Naples-Marco Island.[36] 
With an Arbitron-assigned 783,100 listening area population, the metropolitan 
area ranks 62/299 for the fall of 2006. The metropolitan area is home to 
32 radio stations. Nielsen Media Research designated market area: Ft. Myers-Naples.[37] 
Number of TV homes: 479,130 2006–2007 U.S. rank: 64/210 Fort Myers is home 
to Florida Gulf Coast University. Its teams, the Florida Gulf Coast Eagles, 
play in NCAA Division I in the Atlantic Sun Conference. The Eagles' men's 
basketball team had an average attendance of 2,291 in 2013.[38] The Boston 
Red Sox hold their annual spring training at JetBlue Park in the Fort Myers 
area. A cross-town rivalry has developed with the Minnesota Twins, who 
conduct their spring training at Hammond Stadium in south Lee County, which 
has a capacity of 7,500 and opened in 1991. The Red Sox' lease with Fort 
Myers runs through 2019, but the Red Sox were considering exercising the 
early out in their contract that would have allowed them to leave following 
the 2009 spring season. On October 28, 2008, the Lee County commission 
voted 3–1 to approve an agreement with the Boston Red Sox to build a new 
spring-training facility for the team in south Lee County. The new stadium, 
named JetBlue Park at Fenway South, is located off Daniels Parkway near 
Southwest Florida International Airport. The stadium opened in time for 
the 2012 Spring training season. City of Palms Park had been built in 1992 
for the Red Sox' spring training. Former Red Sox left fielder Mike Greenwell 
is from Fort Myers, and was instrumental in bringing his team to the city 
for spring training.[citation needed] The deal for JetBlue Park left City 
of Palms Park without a tenant. County officials have discussed the possibility 
of securing another team for City of Palms. Terry Park Ballfield (also 
known as the Park T. Pigott Memorial Stadium) in East Fort Myers is also 
not currently in use by a Major League Baseball team, though it is the 
former home of the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh 
Pirates and Kansas City Royals. Coordinates: 26°35′N 81°55′W﻿ / ﻿26.58°N
