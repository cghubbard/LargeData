The San Antonio Missions are a minor league baseball team based in San 
Antonio, Texas. The team, which plays in the Texas League, is the Double-A 
affiliate of the San Diego Padres major-league club. The Missions play 
in Nelson W. Wolff Municipal Stadium, located in San Antonio. Opened in 
1994, the park seats over 6,200 fans and holds more than 9,000. The San 
Antonio Missions' logo features famous local attraction the Alamo, originally 
a Spanish mission. The team's official mascot is "Ballapeño", a baseballing 
jalapeño. The Missions are owned by the Elmore Sports Group, an organization 
which also owns the Inland Empire 66ers of the California League, Colorado 
Springs Sky Sox of the Pacific Coast League, Idaho Falls Chukars of the 
Pioneer League and Eugene Emeralds of the Northwest League. San Antonio 
was home for one of the charter members of the Texas League back in 1888. 
Since that inaugural season the town has hosted a number of Texas League 
franchises, most of them using the "Missions" moniker. Baseball was absent 
only a few of the early years (1893–94, 1900–1906) and again when World 
War II occupied most would-be ballplayers between 1943 and 1945. Initially 
the team went by the names "Missionaries", "Gentlemen" and "Bronchos"—a 
Spanish twist on the name "Broncos". During these years, nearly 250 players 
reached the Major Leagues. The current "Missions" moniker was coined with 
the team's first Major League affiliation, a partnership with the St. Louis 
Browns (later to become the Baltimore Orioles). They remained a Browns 
affiliate through the Texas League's temporary demise after the 1942 season 
due to World War II and until 1959, when they struck up a partnership with 
the Chicago Cubs. While with the Browns/Orioles, the team saw well over 
100 players reach the Majors, including Hall-of-Famers Willard Brown (1956) 
and Brooks Robinson (1956–1957). The "Missions" name was used for the teams 
affiliated with the Cubs, through 1962. In just four years in the Cubs’ 
system, more than 50 alumni reached the Major Leagues—including Ron Santo 
(1959) and Hall-of-Famer Billy Williams (1959). The Missions changed their 
name to the Bullets in 1963, when the team joined the new Houston Colt 
.45s organization. The idea behind the name was that the team's prospects 
would be the "bullets to the gun" of the .45s team. The Bullets boasted 
30 prospects that would go on to see time in the Bigs, including Hall-of-Famer 
Joe Morgan and two-time National League All-Star Jerry Grote. (Much of 
Grote's success came with the Miracle Mets of 1969, and not with the .45s/Astros 
organization.) In 1965 the San Antonio franchise moved to Amarillo. Baseball 
returned to San Antonio for the 1968 season, again taking on the Missions 
name, as part of an expansion of the Texas League. Again playing as a Cubs 
affiliate, another 42 future Big Leaguers took the field over a four-year 
stretch. After the 1971 season the team packed up again and moved to Midland, 
Texas, where they continue as the Midland RockHounds. In 1972 another ownership 
group brought baseball into town to replace the group that left to Midland, 
and brought with it an affiliation with the Milwaukee Brewers, just two 
years removed from their move to Wisconsin from Seattle. With the affiliation 
change to the Brewers, the franchise took the parent club's nickname—which 
it kept despite changes in affiliation to the Cleveland Indians (1973–1975) 
and Texas Rangers (1976). The "Brewers" nickname fit the city almost as 
well as it fit their single-season affiliate in Milwaukee, being the home 
of the Pearl Brewing Company. The future Big Leaguers continued to pour 
onto the field through the affiliation changes, and more than 30 San Antonio 
Brewers made it to the top. Among them was Hall-of-Fame pitcher Dennis 
Eckersley, an Indians farmhand who tore through the Texas League in 1974. 
The team became the San Antonio Dodgers with a change in affiliation to 
the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1977. While the franchise kept the "Dodger" 
moniker for eleven seasons (1977–1987), locals still referred to them occasionally 
as the Missions. The Dodgers responded by officially changing their nickname 
back to "Missions" for the 1988 season. The Missions were the Double-A 
affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers until 2000, making the relationship 
the longest-standing Major League affiliation held by the San Antonio franchise. 
During the partnership Dodgers legends frequented the Alamo City, including 
Tommy Lasorda. In the 23 years with Los Angeles, some 211 players went 
on to see time in the Majors. That includes players like Ron Washington 
(1977), Bob Welch (1977), Ron Roenicke (1978–1979), Mike Scioscia (1978), 
Dave Stewart (1978), Orel Hershiser (1980–1981, 1991), Fernando Valenzuela 
(1980), Steve Sax (1981), Sid Bream (1982), Sid Fernandez (1983), Franklin 
Stubbs (1983), Ramón Martínez (1988, 1996), John Wetteland (1988), Eric 
Karros (1990), Pedro Martínez (1991), Raúl Mondesí (1991–1992), Eric Young 
(1991), Mike Piazza (1992), Henry Blanco (1993–1996), Todd Hollandsworth 
(1993), Chan Ho Park (1994), Miguel Cairo (1995), Paul Lo Duca (1995, 1997), 
Paul Konerko (1996), Alex Cora (1997), Dennys Reyes (1997), Adrián Beltré 
(1998), and Éric Gagné (1999). The team played a bulk of its years with 
the Dodgers at V. J. Keefe Memorial Stadium, which they shared with the 
St. Mary's University baseball team. In 1994 the team moved into Nelson 
W. Wolff Municipal Stadium, a design typical of baseball stadiums build 
during the late-1980s through the mid-1990s. The new stadium was named 
in honor of Nelson Wolff, the mayor of San Antonio at the time the stadium 
was built. The affiliation with the Dodgers ended after the 2000 season 
with both clubs mutually agreeing to part. From 2001 until 2006 the Seattle 
Mariners had a player development contract with the team that brought back-to-back 
Texas League Championships during the 2002 and 2003 seasons. The Mariners, 
fresh off a record season at the Major League level, was stocked with talent 
in a minor league system built by Pat Gillick, who worked with San Antonio 
as the farm director of the Houston Colt .45s in 1963. Gillick's prospects 
turned San Antonio into a Texas League powerhouse, boasting future Major 
Leaguers Willie Bloomquist, Jeff Farnsworth, J. J. Putz, Rafael Soriano, 
Greg Dobbs, Julio Mateo, Gil Meche, Cha Seung Baek, Jose Lopez, George 
Sherrill, Shin-Soo Choo, Félix Hernández, Mike Morse, Aaron Taylor, Aaron 
Looper, Allan Simpson and Yuniesky Betancourt. The 2006 Missions struggled 
to score runs and finished 60–77 overall. (27–41, 33–37). The Missions 
were plagued by high player turnover and featured 52 different players 
over the course of the season. On September 28, 2006, the San Diego Padres 
announced a two-year player development contract with the San Antonio Missions. 
Randy Ready managed the Missions in 2007 following a promotion from Class 
A. The first home game as a member of the Padres organization was April 
12, 2007 a 2–0 win against the Tulsa Drillers. Sean Thompson picked up 
the win and helped score a run. Led by Chase Headley and Josh Geer who 
won player of the year and pitcher of the year honors the Missions were 
the 2007 Texas League Champions. Since the beginning of the affiliation 
with the Padres, the Missions have seen nearly a dozen players crack the 
Big Leagues. Most notably include rising Padres regulars: Chase Headley, 
Kyle Blanks, Nick Hundley, Tim Stauffer, Mat Latos, Matt Antonelli, Chad 
Huffman, Will Venable and Luis Durango. Since the Corpus Christi Hooks 
moved to Corpus Christi from Round Rock in 2005 they have been the chief 
rivals of the Missions. The main point of the rivalry is to determine who 
is the better team of South Texas. Recently the Hooks have stated on their 
website that they are the "Baseball Capital of South Texas" The Missions 
recently ousted the Hooks from the TLDS in 2013. Prior to the birth of 
the Corpus Christi franchise, the chief rivalry was with the Round Rock 
Express, now a Triple-A member of the Pacific Coast League. The 2009 season 
started out with an exhibition game between players on the Missions roster 
and members of the Padres’ Big League Spring Training roster. The result 
was a 7–3 win for the minor league guys, bolstered by a grand slam by hometown 
hero Seth Johnston. Under the leadership of former MLB All-Star Terry Kennedy, 
the team earned a playoff berth by winning the first-half division title—clinching 
the berth on the road during an extra-innings win at Corpus Christi on 
June 23, the last game in the first half of the season. The season was 
anti-climactic, however, as the team struggled down the final stretch and 
into playoffs. The Missions were eliminated by the Midland RockHounds, 
the eventual Texas League title winners, in four games—mustering enough 
excitement to win one playoff game behind the pitching of Will Inman. During 
Game 2 of the southern division championship series, the benches cleared 
when Mitch Canham defended Inman, who let out a yell to celebrate striking 
out Midland's catcher Josh Donaldson. When Canham came to bat the following 
inning, Midland pitcher Carlos Hernández threw a pitch that came close 
to Canham's head, clearing the benches again and nearly provoking a fight 
between the teams. Several players stood out at times during the 2009 season, 
some of them being promoted for their performance. Outfielder Mike Baxter 
was promoted early on for his assault on Texas League pitching, batting 
.376 with 23 doubles in 51 games. Pitchers Tim Stauffer, Cesar Carrillo 
and Mat Latos were promoted to the Padres after performing well at the 
Double-A level, though Stauffer and Carrillo both spent a few weeks at 
the Triple-A level before moving on to the Majors. First baseman Craig 
Cooper led the team with a .312 average and 11 home runs by the end of 
the season. Outfielder Luis Durango led the Texas League with 44 stolen 
bases. Right-hander Ernesto Frieri led the team in most pitching categories, 
finishing the season protected on the 40-man Major League roster. Other 
noteworthy players include shortstop Lance Zawadzki, who played in the 
Arizona Fall League All-Star Game; third baseman Logan Forsythe, who led 
all of minor league baseball in on-base percentage for a bulk of the season; 
Cedric Hunter; lefty Nathan Culp and outfielder Sawyer Carroll. Also, second 
baseman Eric Sogard opened enough eyes to be sought by the Oakland Athletics 
in a trade that sent Sogard and Kevin Kouzmanoff to the A's and Scott Hairston 
and Aaron Cunningham. On December 1, 2009, the Padres announced Kennedy 
and his coaching staff would be promoted to the Triple-A Portland Beavers 
of the Pacific Coast League for the 2010 season, and the Missions would 
be managed by Doug Dascenzo, who managed the Single-A Fort Wayne TinCaps 
to the best regular-season record in minor league baseball and a Midwest 
League title in 2009. The 2010 Texas League All-Star Game, hosted by the 
division rival Midland RockHounds, featured seven Missions players—including 
three starters. Pitchers Simón Castro, Wynn Pelzer, Craig Italiano and 
Evan Scribner were selected to represent the Missions along with catcher 
Luis Martinez, first baseman Matt Clark and outfielder Cedric Hunter. Just 
before the game, Cedric was promoted to the Triple-A Portland Beavers, 
allowing utility infielder Andy Parrino to attend the All-Star Game in 
his place. On July 29 the San Diego Padres traded Wynn Pelzer to the Baltimore 
Orioles in exchange for slugging infielder Miguel Tejada and cash. The 
Missions got a hot start to the 2011 season, finishing April with the best 
record in Double-A baseball.[1] Remarkably, they also amassed the most 
home runs of any team in Minor League Baseball in that time despite playing 
in the notoriously pitcher-friendly Wolff Stadium. Their early season success 
can be attributed to a roster filled with some of the top slugging prospects 
in the Padres' system, including Jaff and Cody Decker (not related). They 
have also had an offensive boost with the return of Kyle Blanks. Blanks 
played for the Missions in 2008 and is currently rehabbing after having 
Tommy John surgery performed in July 2010.[2] The Missions hosted the 75th 
Annual Texas League All-Star Game on June 29, 2011.[3] The Missions won 
the 1st half division title, thus going to the playoffs. The Missions won 
their 12th Texas League Championship, sweeping the Arkansas Travelers in 
the Texas League Championship series. In 2012, Nate Freiman played for 
the Missions and led the league in RBIs (105) and hits (154).[4][5] He 
was both a Texas League Mid-Season and Post-Season All-Star, and an MILB.com 
San Diego Padres All-Star. The San Antonio Missions rely more on the traditional 
approach to delivering a simple baseball game to their fans than other 
teams in minor league baseball, which is known for hosting a slew of wacky 
promotions. However, the Missions are known for a few of their own promotions—some 
of which have garnered nationwide attention within the industry. During 
the seventh inning of each game, an auxiliary mascot named Henry the Puffy 
Taco is chased around the bases by a kid from the stands, typically between 
6 and 10 years of age. The kid tackles the giant taco to the ground just 
before reaching home plate (they start at first base), then poses triumphantly 
over the downed mascot. Henry has only won the race once, in 1992. In that 
race, Henry mis-timed his steps and he inadvertently crossed home plate 
before his 10-year-old opponent. Nearly 20 years later the Missions hosted 
a rematch and, on June 24, 2010, the kid finally avenged his loss. In recent 
years the team has gained attention from within the baseball industry for 
two unique giveaway nights—Shirt Off Your Back and Used Car Giveaway. In 
the first, often held on or near the last game of the season, the jerseys 
worn by the players during the game are raffled off to fans in the stands 
(raffle tickets are offered at no charge, and each fan is limited to one 
entry). The same raffle format is used for the Used Car Giveaway, where 
more than 10 used cars are given away throughout the night. In 2010 the 
prizes included a 2001 Ford Mustang and a 2001 Volvo S60. Like most Minor 
League Baseball teams, the Missions use on-field emcees to execute their 
promotions. The Missions have an emcee personality named "Lefty", performed 
by a rotating tandem of J.C. Carpenter and Mike Lavender. Pitchers Catchers

More than 700 former San Antonio baseball players have reached the Major 
Leagues, if only for a "cup of coffee". Some of the more notable players 
include: In addition, Brian Anderson—the former radio voice of the San 
Antonio Missions—has reached the Big Leagues as the broadcaster for the 
Milwaukee Brewers. More recently, broadcaster Stu Paul has moved closer 
to his dream of being in the Majors and is now broadcasting for the Nashville 
Sounds of the PCL. Often referred to as the "Jewel of the Texas League" 
(probably a moniker given the facility when it was new in 1994), Wolff 
Stadium is currently the oldest ballpark in the Texas League with 17 years 
of use. The ballpark seats more than 6,200 and, when counting the "outfield 
berm" seating holds more than 9,000 spectators. Missions management has 
been seeking a new stadium since 2009, hoping to work in tandem with the 
University of Texas at San Antonio to bring a viable project about. Tickets 
for Missions games are priced on par with other minor league parks, ranging 
from $10 to $14 based on the section of the ballpark[6] or $5 for berm
