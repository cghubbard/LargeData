Gene Monahan (born 1945[1]) is the former head athletic trainer for the 
New York Yankees of Major League Baseball. He spent almost 50 years with 
the Yankees organization and from 1973 until 2011[2] was part of their 
training staff. During his tenure Monahan cared for the players on seven 
World Championship teams, 11 Pennant winning teams and 19 post-season teams. 
Since 2011, he has served as a consultant for NASCAR team Hendrick Motorsports 
as part of the team's pit crew staff, having cared for the pit crews on 
the 2013 Sprint Cup and 2014 second division (now Xfinity) teams under 
the Hendrick auspices. Monahan grew up the oldest of eight children. He 
is a huge racing fan. Monahan graduated from Indiana University in 1969 
with a bachelor's degree in physical education.[3] Monahan's connection 
to the Yankees began when was hired as a batboy in 1962. For ten years, 
he worked as a trainer and clubhouse attendant in the minor leagues. In 
1973, after George Steinbrenner purchased the team, he was hired as an 
athletic trainer.[3] For the better part of the next 39 seasons, Monahan 
was entrusted to care for and tend to the injuries of players from Reggie 
Jackson to Derek Jeter. During his time with the team, they won seven World 
Series Championships, (1977, 1978, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2009). After 
the 2009 season, Monahan was diagnosed with throat cancer,[4] which doctors 
now believe originated in his tonsils.[5] He had surgery in January 2010, 
and underwent radiation therapy for several months, which forced him to 
miss his first spring training in 48 years.[5] He was present, however, 
for an emotional World Series ring Ceremony on Opening Day, April 12, 2010.[6] 
At the conclusion of the 2010 season Monahan and longtime assistant Steve 
Donohue were named the best athletic trainers in MLB by the Professional 
Baseball Athletic Trainer Society.[7] On May 11, 2011, the Yankees announced 
that Monahan would retire following the 2011 season,[8] and on June 26, 
2011, the team honored him at their annual Old-Timers' Day.[9] Monahan 
is one of only three members of the Yankee organization to serve the entire 
length of George Steinbrenner's ownership,[6] but over the years he has 
often joked he was probably "fired" by The Boss on more occasions than 
all the Yankee managers combined. After retiring from the Yankees, Monahan 
moved from his home in Hackensack, New Jersey to Mooresville, North Carolina, 
where he now works as a consultant for Hendrick Motorsports. Monahan serves 
as an athletic trainer for Hendrick's pit crew members, most of which come 
from an athletic background.[10] In 2011, he was inducted into the Irish 
American Baseball Hall of Fame.[11] He has appeared at every Old-Timers'
