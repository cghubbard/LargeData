Summit is a city in Union County, New Jersey, United States. At the 2010 
United States Census, the city's population was 21,457,[9][10][11] reflecting 
an increase of 326 (+1.5%) from the 21,131 counted in the 2000 Census, 
which had in turn increased by 1,374 (+7.0%) from the 19,757 counted in 
the 1990 Census.[19] Summit had the 16th-highest per capita income in the 
state as of the 2000 Census.[20] Originally incorporated as Summit Township 
by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 23, 1869, from portions 
of New Providence Township (now Berkeley Heights) and Springfield Township, 
Summit was reincorporated as a city on March 8, 1899.[21][22] Possible 
derivations of Summit's name include its location atop the Second Watchung 
Mountain; the Summit Lodge, the house to which jurist James Kent moved 
in 1837 and which stands today at 50 Kent Place Boulevard; and to a local 
sawmill owner who granted passage to the Morris and Essex Railroad for 
a route to "the summit of the Short Hills".[23][24][25] The region in which 
Summit is located was purchased from Native Americans on October 28, 1664. 
Summit's earliest European settlers came to the area around the year 1710.[26] 
The original name of Summit was "Turkey Hill" to distinguish it from the 
area then known as "Turkey" (New Providence's original name until 1759). 
During the American Revolutionary War period, Summit was known as "Beacon 
Hill", because bonfire beacons were lit on an eastern ridge in Summit to 
warn the New Jersey militiamen of approaching British troops.[27] Summit 
was called the "Heights over Springfield" during the late 18th century 
and most of the 19th century, and was considered a part of New Providence. 
During this period, Summit was part of Springfield Township, which eventually 
broke up into separate municipalities. Eventually only Summit and New Providence 
remained joined. Lord Chancellor James Kent, a Chancellor of New York State 
and author of Commentaries on American Law, retired to this area in 1837 
in a house he called Summit Lodge (perhaps a namesake of the town) on what 
is now called Kent Place Boulevard.[23] He lived there until 1847. Today, 
the lodge is part of a large mansion, at 50 Kent Place Boulevard, opposite 
Kent Place School. In 1837, the Morris and Essex Railroad, which became 
the Delaware Lackawanna and Western Railroad and is now New Jersey Transit's 
Morris and Essex Lines, was built over what was then called "The Summit" 
hill, a name later shortened to Summit. The railroad allowed Summit to 
outgrow neighboring New Providence, which didn't have a train station. 
In 1868, a hotel named "The Summit House" burned beside the railroad.[28] 
In 1869, Summit and New Providence separated and the Summit area was incorporated 
as the "Township of Summit".[21] In the late 19th century, the area began 
shifting from farmland to wealthy estates; in 1892, renowned architect 
C. Abbott French cleared away a crest of a "summit ridge", removing "an 
impenetrable tangle of wild vines ... and myriads of rattlesnakes," to 
build a house with a view of New York City, The Times Building, and the 
Brooklyn Bridge.[29] The present-day incarnation of Summit, known formally 
as the City of Summit, was incorporated on April 11, 1899.[26] During this 
time, Summit was the home of America's "antivice crusader", Anthony Comstock, 
who moved there about 1880 and built a house in 1892 at 35 Beekman Road, 
where he died in 1915.[30][31] In the 19th century, Summit served as a 
nearby getaway spot for wealthy residents of New York City in search of 
fresh air. Weekenders or summer vacationers would reach Summit by train 
and relax at large hotels and smaller inns and guest houses.[32] Calvary 
Episcopal Church was built in 1894-95; the New York Times called it a "handsome 
new house of worship".[33] Silk weaving thrived as an industry in the late 
19th century, but declined in the early decades of the 20th century; in 
1915, there was a strike at the Summit Silk Company on Weaver Street.[34] 
In the early 20th century, there was much building; in 1909, one report 
suggested at least 40 residences were being built (some with stables) with 
costs varying from $4,500 to $45,000, making it "one of the greatest periods 
of building activity this place, the Hill City, has known."[35] A new railway 
was constructed from what was then-called New Orange.[36] The Rahway Valley 
Railroad connected Summit with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad 
(DL&W). In the early 20th century, both freight and passenger service were 
offered by this line which is currently out of service, although in 2009, 
Union County was exploring the possibility of reactivating the line for 
freight traffic.[37] A trolley line called the Morris County Traction Company, 
once ran a passenger trolley through Summit to/from Newark and Morris County, 
in the early part of the 20th century.[38] Broad Street in Summit was designed 
and built for the trolley, which is why it is wider and straighter than 
most streets in the city. Portions of the rails could still be seen on 
it as late as the 1980s. Relations between city authorities and businesses 
have not always been smooth; in 1898, city authorities and the New York 
and New Jersey Telephone Company had disputes about wires and telephone 
poles; the city acted and "wires and cables of the company were cut from 
the poles."[39] There were disputes between Summit's commuters and the 
Lackawanna railroad about walkways; in one incident in 1905, "a number 
of passengers seeking to board the 6:35 train found their way barred. They 
made a united rush, and when the dust cleared away, the door wasn't there. 
It is said the company will put the door back. The commuters say they will 
remove it as often as it is replaced."[40] Following World War II, the 
city experienced a great building boom, as living outside New York City 
and commuting to work became more common and the population of New Jersey 
grew. At this point, Summit took on its suburban character of tree lined 
streets and architect-designed houses that it is known for today.[41] Summit 
had a mini-bus system, with three routes, in the late 1970s. The mini-buses 
ran through most parts of Summit on long circular routes that were primarily 
designed to bring commuters to the railroad station in downtown Summit. 
The Velvet Underground played their first paid concert at a Summit High 
School prom.[42] During the September 11 terrorist attacks, Summit lost 
more than a dozen residents.[43] Many residents worked in the World Trade 
Center commuting by rail to Hoboken.[43] A few days after the attacks, 
townspeople assembled on the broad town green while a minister "called 
out the names of a dozen residents still unaccounted for after Tuesday's 
attack on the World Trade Center. Others in the crowd of nearly 2,000 called 
out names he had left out."[43] A few World Trade Center firms relocated 
to Summit.[44] Star baseball athlete Willie Wilson and former Summit graduate 
returned to Summit High School in 2005.[45] Wilson said: "To me, Summit 
is a special place ... It's where it all began and I have great memories. 
This is where I want to help kids and youth baseball, and I want my own 
son and daughter to come and help me create something here." During the 
economic downturn of 2008-2009, Summit was listed as #6 on a list of American 
communities "likely to be pummeled by the economic crisis."[45] Crime is 
generally not a factor in the city, although a man was fatally beaten during 
a robbery attempt gone awry in summer 2010; several youths were charged 
in the murder of Abelino Mazariego-Torres and reports of the murder shocked 
residents in what one person described as a "very small and very peaceful 
town."[46] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a 
total area of 6.046 square miles (15.661 km2), including 5.995 square miles 
(15.528 km2) of land and 0.051 square miles (0.133 km2) of water (0.85%).[1][2] 
It is about 20 miles (32 km) from Manhattan. Springfield Avenue is the 
town's main street.[45] Unincorporated communities, localities and place 
names located partially or completely within the city include Brantwood 
Park and Tall Oaks.[47] It is bordered to the northeast by Millburn in 
Essex County, to the northwest by Chatham and Chatham Township, both in 
Morris County, to the west by New Providence, to the southwest by Berkeley 
Heights, to the south by Mountainside and to the southeast by Springfield 
Township.[48] One report was that Manhattan's financial elite prefers Summit 
real estate because of big houses, good schools and New Jersey Transit 
rail link to Manhattan's financial district.[43] Others suggested that 
the city has long been popular with traders, investment bankers, and money 
managers, with nearly 20% of Summit's residents working in finance and 
real estate.[45] At the 2010 United States Census, there were 21,457 people, 
7,708 households, and 5,519 families residing in the city. The population 
density was 3,578.9 per square mile (1,381.8/km2). There were 8,190 housing

females there were 96.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there 
were 92.0 males.[9] The Census Bureau's 2006-2010 American Community Survey 
showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household income 
was $109,602 and the median family income was $145,083. Males had a median

The per capita income for the city was $70,574. About 4.4% of families 
and 6.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.4% 
of those under age 18 and 5.9% of those age 65 or over.[59] At the 2000 
United States Census[16] there were 21,131 people, 7,897 households and 
5,606 families residing in the city. The population density was 3,490.7

residents of Summit include: The Summit Opera House was originally built 
in the 1890s by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union as a dry entertainment 
hall and local W.C.T.U. meeting place. It currently houses Winberie's restaurant 
on the ground floor, and a church, office space, and apartments on the 
upper floors. It is located at Springfield Avenue and Kent Place Boulevard 
in downtown Summit.[64] The Summit Playhouse features live dramatic performances.[65] 
The Visual Arts Center of New Jersey on Elm Street diagonally across from 
the Summit Middle School is a professionally recognized regional art center 
with an art school and an exhibition program.[66] The Reeves-Reed Arboretum 
is a suburban conservancy dedicated to environmental and horticultural 
education for children and adults and enjoyment of nature through the professional 
care and preservation of a historic country estate.[67] On April 11, 1899, 
Summit voters adopted as the Charter of the City of Summit the Statute 
of 1899 applicable to cities of less than 12,000 population. On December 
15, 1987, the New Jersey Legislature enacted a law that repealed all of 
the remaining provisions of Summit's original Charter and replaced and 
retained sections not covered by general law and specific to Summit's original 
Charter. Summit's Charter now allows that "1: The council may, by referendum, 
change the term of the councilman at large from a two year term to a four 
year term. 2: Resolutions adopted by the council do not have to be approved 
by the mayor. 3: The council pro tempore shall be the acting mayor in the 
mayor's absence due to sickness or other cause. 4: The municipality may 
appoint an administrator in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S. 40A:9-136. 
5: The municipality may adopt an administrative code."[7][68] The mayor 
is elected by the city for a four-year term and is the city's official 
spokesman and chief elected official. The mayor can appoint various officials, 
including the chief of police and the board of education. The mayor serves 
as the chairman of the Board of School Estimate and on various committees, 
and has the right to speak at common council meetings, but can only vote 
to break ties in the council. This bully pulpit role is considered the 
mayor's strongest power. The common council has the chief policy making 
and administrative oversight role in city government. The council approves 
all laws and adopts the city budget. The council also oversees the work 
of city department heads. The council consists of three members from Ward 
I, three members from Ward II and one member elected at-large. The at-large 
member serves a two-year term of office, while the six ward members serve 
three-year terms on a staggered basis, with one seat in each ward up for 
election each year. The council elects from its membership a president 
and a president pro tem, each serving a one-year term. The president presides 
at all council meetings, and the president pro tem presides in the president's 
absence. The president pro tem also serves as acting mayor in the absence 
of the mayor. As of 2016[update], the mayor of Summit is Democrat Nora 
G. Radest, whose term of office ends December 31, 2019.[3] Members of the 
common council are Council President Michael T. McTernan (R, 2016; First 
Ward), President Pro Tem Sandra R. Lizza (R, 2016; Second Ward), Patrick 
J. Hurley (R, 2017; Second Ward), B. David Naidu (D, 2018; First Ward), 
Mary G. Ogden (R, 2018; Second Ward), Dr. Robert J. Rubino (First Ward; 
R, 2017) and Richard Sun (D, 2018; At Large).[69][70][71][72][73][74][75] 
Michael F. Rogers is the city administrator of Summit. In this role he 
directs day-to-day operations of city government and the city departments.[5] 
Summit has been a stronghold for the Republican Party for years. From 1921 
to 2001 no Democrats served in elective office and very few ran for office. 
The real elections occurred in the Republican primary. In 2001, Democratic 
candidates Michel Bitritto won a council seat in Ward I and Jordan Glatt 
won the at-large council seat. Summit had never elected a Democrat as mayor 
until 2003, when Jordan Glatt was elected.[76] In November 2011, Republicans 
swept all the open seats, with Ellen Dickson elected mayor and Gregory 
Drummond, Patrick Hurley and Robert Rubino sweeping the three council seats, 
giving full control of city government back to the Republican party.[77] 
The Department of Community Services is responsible for engineering, public 
works, and code administration.[78] The engineering division manages city 
infrastructure such as roads, curbs, sewers, and provide support to the 
planning and zoning boards.[78] Public works maintains streets, trees, 
traffic signs, public parks, traffic islands, playgrounds, public buildings, 
support vehicles, equipment, and has other responsibilities.[78] The city 
runs a municipal disposal area or solid waste transfer station where recyclables 
are collected, including bulky trash; residents must have a town-generated 
sticker on their cars to use this facility.[78] Trash is picked up from 
garbage cans once a week for most residents, and recycling materials are 
picked up every two weeks.[78] Certain trees need permits before being 
removed.[78] Summit plows 66 miles (106 km) of roads, covering all city 
streets, except for county roads.[78] Residents are asked to put leaves 
in biodegradable bags for pickup on selected times during autumn and spring.[78] 
Recently the city has embarked on a program of "Bringing Art to Public 
Spaces in Summit"; this program, established in 2002, has placed sculptures 
at different venues around the town and is supported by private donations.[79] 
The Summit Chamber of Commerce advertises the town on cable television.[45] 
Summit is located in the 7th Congressional District[80] and is part of 
New Jersey's 21st state legislative district.[10][81][82] New Jersey's 
Seventh Congressional District is represented by Leonard Lance (R, Clinton 
Township).[83] New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by 
Cory Booker (D, Newark, term ends 2021)[84] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 
2019).[85][86] For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General Assembly), the 
21st Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented 
in the State Senate by Thomas Kean Jr. (R, Westfield) and in the General 
Assembly by Jon Bramnick (R, Westfield) and Nancy Munoz (R, Summit).[87] 
The Governor of New Jersey is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[88] 
The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[89] 
Union County is governed by a Board of Chosen Freeholders, whose nine members 
are elected at-large to three-year terms of office on a staggered basis 
with three seats coming up for election each year, with an appointed County 
Manager overseeing the day-to-day operations of the county. At an annual 
reorganization meeting held in the beginning of January, the board selects 
a Chairman and Vice Chairman from among its members.[90] As of 2014[update], 
Union County's Freeholders are Chairman Christopher Hudak (D, Linden, term 
ends December 31, 2014),[91] Vice Chairman Mohamed S. Jalloh (D, Roselle, 
2015),[92] Bruce Bergen (D, Springfield Township, 2015),[93] Linda Carter 
(D, Plainfield, 2016),[94] Angel G. Estrada (D, Elizabeth, 2014),[95] Sergio 
Granados (D, Elizabeth, 2016)[96] Bette Jane Kowalski (D, Cranford, 2016),[97] 
Alexander Mirabella (D, Fanwood, 2015)[98] and Vernell Wright (D, Union, 
2014).[99][100] Constitutional officers elected on a countywide basis are 
County Clerk Joanne Rajoppi (D, Union, 2015),[101] Sheriff Ralph Froehlich 
(D, Union, 2016)[102] and Surrogate James S. LaCorte (D, Springfield Township, 
2014).[103][104] The County Manager is Alfred Faella.[105] As of March 
23, 2011, there were a total of 13,358 registered voters in Summit, of 
which 3,842 (28.8% vs. 41.8% countywide) were registered as Democrats, 
3,703 (27.7% vs. 15.3%) were registered as Republicans and 5,808 (43.5%

Students in pre-Kindergarten through twelfth grade are educated by the 
Summit Public Schools. As of the 2012-13 school year, the district's nine 
schools had an enrollment of 4,121 students and 335.0 classroom teachers 
(on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.30:1.[115] Schools 
in the district (with 2012-13 enrollment data from the National Center 
for Education Statistics[116]) are Jefferson Primary School[117] (grades 
PreK-K; 165 students), Wilson Primary School[118] (PK-K; 172), Brayton 
School[119] (1-5; 361), Franklin School[120] (1-5; 381), Jefferson School[121] 
(1-5; 234), Lincoln-Hubbard School[122] (1-5; 332), Washington School[123] 
(1-5; 317), Lawton C. Johnson Summit Middle School[124] (6-8; 1,041) and 
Summit High School[125] (9-12; 1,118).[126] Summit has sports programs 
for youth including basketball, baseball, soccer and football leagues through 
the Recreation Center. In addition, the YMCA organizes sports clinics and 
teams including the Summit Swim Team. At age eight, children can try out 
for a traveling soccer program called the Summit Soccer Club, a nonprofit 
dedicated to the development of youth soccer in the city. Travel soccer 
runs for both the fall and spring seasons. Lacrosse is a popular sport 
with high school teams achieving distinction at county and state levels.[134][135] 
Summit High School boys' team won the state's Tournament of Champions in 
2010 and 2009 and lost by one goal in the 2011 final. Summit holds the 
New Jersey state (and possibly national) high school record with 68 consecutive 
victories during 2009 to 2011.[136] The 2012 team was ranked second in 
New Jersey in May 2012 and in the top 20 nationally. Beginning in first 
grade, boys and girls can learn to play lacrosse in clinics and teams organized 
by the Summit Lacrosse Club.[137] Summit residential real estate is expensive. 
In October 2009, the median house price was $655,500.[138] Real estate 
taxes vary; an $800,000 four-bedroom, 2-full-bath, 2-partial-bath single-family 
home built in 1939 had taxes of $16,000 in 2009.[139] Summit, along with 
many suburban communities in the United States, adopted a policy of zoning 
ordinances requiring a single-family house on a large lot and could thereby 
"exclude any undesirable influences that might erode property values", 
a requirement that effectively excluded apartment buildings and multi-family 
dwellings, and tended to raise the price of houses. One study found that 
since 1945, the single-family house on a large lot zoning mechanism "has 
been increasingly used in suburban and rural areas to safeguard particular 
vested interests."[140] A reporter from The New York Times who is a Summit 
resident criticized the city for being an "economically, racially and ideologically 
homogenized populace" with "a growing divide between Summit's haves and 
have-nots."[141] He elaborated in 2006: "there's an ever-diminishing corner 
of the city akin to the so-called slums of Beverly Hills, where middle-income 
homeowners like me can take advantage of the schools and services of Summit 
without the million-dollar price tags so ubiquitous on the other side of 
the Midtown Direct tracks."[141] But he preferred the city as a place to 
raise and educate his children.[141] One developer sued the city in 2005
