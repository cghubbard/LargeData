Hamilton is a city in and the county seat of Butler County, Ohio, United 
States, in the state's southwestern corner.[7] The population was 62,447 
at the 2010 census.[8] The city is part of the Cincinnati metropolitan 
area. Its neighborhood of Lindenwald, settled by German immigrants in the 
mid-19th century and later, is one of three designated National Historic 
Districts. The city has a council-manager form of government. Its mayor 
is Patrick Moeller and the city manager is Joshua Smith. Most of the city 
is in the Hamilton City School District. The industrial city is seeking 
to revitalize through the arts; it was officially declared the "City of 
Sculpture" in 2000.[9] Its initiative has attracted many sculpture installations 
to the city, which founded the Pyramid Hill Sculpture Park. Hamilton, Ohio, 
was founded in 1791 as Fort Hamilton (named to honor Alexander Hamilton). 
The northwest frontier military fort was built to serve as a supply station 
for the troops of generals Arthur St. Clair and later Anthony Wayne. Their 
armies entered the Miami Valley to drive out the Shawnee and Miami during 
the Northwest Indian War of the 1790s. The Indians hoped to maintain their 
territory here, but, following the American Revolutionary War, the United 
States wanted to open it for European-American settlement and succeeded 
in pushing out the indigenous peoples. The fort was located on the Great 
Miami River, where the east and west banks rose gradually. The river is 
shallow during normal flow and easily forded by men, animals and wagons 
on its gravelly bottom. By 1800, the fort had been abandoned, and Hamilton 
was becoming an agricultural and regional trading town. The town was platted, 
government was seated, and the town named by 1803. Hamilton was first incorporated 
by act of the Ohio General Assembly in 1810, but lost its status in 1815 
for failure to hold elections. It was reincorporated in 1827 with Rossville, 
the community across the Great Miami River in St. Clair Township. The two 
places severed their connection in 1831 only to be rejoined in 1854. Designated 
the county seat, this became a city in 1857. On 14 March 1867, Hamilton 
withdrew from the townships of Fairfield and St. Clair to form a "paper 
township", but the city government is dominant. On the afternoon of 17 
September 1859, Abraham Lincoln arrived at the Hamilton Station (the station 
is on the city's Historic Preservation list). He gave a campaign speech 
in support of his fellow Republican, William Dennison, who was running 
for Ohio governor. Lincoln's speech concentrated on popular sovereignty. 
He began: "This beautiful and far-famed Miami Valley is the garden spot 
of the world." It was during this campaign that the relatively unknown 
Lincoln was first mentioned as a possible presidential contender.[10] By 
the mid-19th century, Hamilton had developed as a significant manufacturing 
city. Its early products were often machines and equipment used to process 
the region’s farm produce, such as steam engines, hay cutters, reapers 
and threshers. Other production included machine tools, house hardware, 
saws for mills, paper, paper making machinery, carriages, guns, whiskey, 
beer, woolen goods, and myriad and diverse output made from metal, grain, 
and cloth. By the early 20th century, the town was a heavy-manufacturing 
center for vaults and safes, machine tools, cans for vegetables, paper, 
paper making machinery, locomotives, frogs and switches for railroads, 
steam engines, diesel engines, foundry products, printing presses, and 
automobile parts. During the two world wars, its factories manufactured 
war materiel, Liberty ship engines, and gun lathes. Manufacturers used 
coke to feed furnaces. Its by-product, gas, fueled street lights. The Great 
Miami River valley, in which Hamilton was located, had become an industrial 
giant. The county courthouse, constructed between 1885 and 1889, has been 
listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its monumental 
architecture. The city has three historic districts, including Lindenwald 
and others that feature turn-of-the-century homes. Like Cincinnati, Hamilton 
attracted many German and Italian immigrants from the mid-19th century 
on, whose influence was expressed in culture, food and architecture. Hamilton 
also had a Jewish community; with increased immigration by Eastern European 
Jews, they founded Beth Israel Synagogue in 1901 as an Orthodox alternative 
to Hamilton's Reform synagogue. It had been founded by German Jews in the 
1880s, when nearby Cincinnati was a center of Reform Judaism in the United 
States. At the time around 250 Jewish families lived in Hamilton.[12][13] 
In the 1920s, many Chicago gangsters established second homes in Hamilton. 
This gave Hamilton the nickname "Little Chicago". Some of these men appeared 
to have invested in what became an active district of gambling and prostitution. 
During World War II, the military declared the entire city off-limits to 
its enlisted personnel because of its numerous gambling and prostitution 
establishments. Madame Freeze's and the long row of prostitution houses 
along Wood Street (now called Pershing Ave) were notorious among soldiers. 
Factories in Hamilton converted their operations to support the war effort, 
manufacturing military supplies, such as tank turrets, Liberty ship and 
submarine engines, and machined and stamped metal parts. With the 1950s 
came the construction of the new interstate highway I-75, part of a nationwide 
system and one which bypassed the city. A decision made to reduce traffic 
through the city resulted in cutting it off from the newest transportation 
network, and businesses were drawn to areas outside with access to the 
highway. Until 1999, when the Butler County Veterans Highway was built, 
Hamilton was the second-largest city in the United States without direct 
interstate access.[3] On 30 March 1975, Easter Sunday, James Ruppert murdered 
11 family members in his mother's house at 635 Minor Avenue in Hamilton, 
in what is referred to as the "Easter Sunday Massacre". The murders shocked 
the town of Hamilton and the entire country. This was the deadliest shooting 
inside a private residence in American history. In the late 20th century, 
industrial restructuring in heavy manufacturing resulted in widespread 
loss of jobs in older industrial cities, as operations were merged, relocated, 
and finally moved offshore. Like other Rust Belt cities in the northern 
tier, Hamilton has struggled to develop a new economy after such wide-scale 
changes but it has retained more of its population than many such cities. 
In addition, since the late 20th century it has attracted new immigrants, 
primarily Hispanics from Mexico and Latin America. On 28 May 1986, as part 
of a plan to increase publicity about Hamilton, the city council voted 
5-1 in favor of adding an exclamation point to the city's name. Thus, Hamilton 
officially became Hamilton![14] While used extensively in the city's documents, 
letterheads, business cards and on local signage, "Hamilton!" was not successful 
in getting Rand McNally to use the new moniker on state maps and the change 
was not recognized by the Federal Board on Geographical Names. The city's 
website does not use the exclamation point. In 2009, the city won the Berkeley 
Springs International Water Tasting Awards for best-tasting municipal water 
for the United States; and in 2010, a Gold Medal for the best in the world.[15] 
Geographic and geological evidence shows that floods have occurred throughout 
the valley since prehistoric times. Since European-American settlement, 
diaries, anecdotes, folk tales, letters, and official records have provided 
documentation of relatively common severe floods in 1814, 1828, 1832, 1847, 
1866, 1883, 1897, 1898, and 1907. In March 1913 the greatest flood occurred. 
Heavy rain fell over the entire watershed, and the ground was frozen, as 
well as saturated from previous lighter rains. This resulted in a high 
rate of run-off from the rain: an estimated 90% flowed directly into the 
streams, creeks, and rivers. Between 9 and 11 inches of rain fell over 
five days, March 25 to March 29, 1913. An amount equivalent to about 30 
days' discharge of water over Niagara Falls flowed through the Miami Valley 
during the ensuing flood. In the Great Miami River Valley, 360 persons 
died, about 200 of whom were from Hamilton. Some drowned, some were washed 
away and never found, others died from various diseases and complications, 
and some committed suicide because of severe losses. Damage in the valley 
was calculated at $100 million, the equivalent of $2 billion in 21st-century 
value. The flood waters were so powerful that within two hours they destroyed 
all four of Hamilton's bridges: Black Street, High-Main Street, Columbia, 
and the railroad bridge. In Hamilton the flood waters rose with unexpected 
and frightening suddenness, reaching over three to eight feet in depth 
in downtown, and up to eighteen feet in the North End, along Fifth Street 
and through South Hamilton Crossing. The waters spread from D Street on 
the west to what is now Erie Highway on the east. The waters' rise was 
so swift that many people were trapped in the upper floors of businesses 
and houses. In some cases, people had to escape to their attics, and then 
break through the roof as the waters rose even higher. Temperatures hovered 
near freezing. The water current varied, but in constricted locations it 
raced at more than twenty miles per hour. The dead people, more than 1,000 
drowned horses, other livestock, and pets, and sewage tainted the water. 
Nearly one-third of the population was left homeless and displaced: 10,000 
of the 35,000 residents of Hamilton. Thousands of houses were destroyed 
by the flood; afterward, many that were too damaged to repair had to be 
demolished by city workers. Hamilton is located at 39°23′45″N 84°33′54″W﻿ 
/ ﻿39.39583°N 84.56500°W﻿ / 39.39583; -84.56500 (39.395806, -84.564920).[16] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area 
of 22.08 square miles (57.19 km2), of which 21.60 square miles (55.94 km2) 
is land and 0.48 square miles (1.24 km2) is water.[2] Highways serving 
Hamilton are US Highway 127, State Route 128, State Route 129, State Route 
130, and State Route 4. Hamilton's location at the intersection of U.S. 
Route 127 and State Routes 128. 129, and 130 makes the city one of the 
few towns located at the intersection of four consecutively numbered highways.

also called the Hamilton & Rossville Hydraulic, was a system devised to 
supply water power to shops and mills; it spurred one of Hamilton's greatest 
periods of industrial and population growth (1840-1860). Specially built 
canals and natural reservoirs brought water from the Great Miami River 
north of Hamilton into the town as a source of power for future industries. 
The hydraulic began about four miles north of Hamilton on the river, where 
a dam was built to divert water into the system. Nearby, two reservoirs 
stored water for the hydraulic, whose main canal continued south along 
North Fifth Street to present Market Street. There it took a sharp west 
turn to the river at the present intersection of Market Street and North 
Monument Avenue, between the former Hamilton Municipal Building and the 
present Courtyard by Marriott. The first water passed through the system 
in January 1845. As the water flowed through the canal, it turned millstones 
in the hydraulic. The project had been a risky one because there were no 
shops along its course to use the power when the company was organized 
in 1842. The gamble paid off. Several small industries were built on the 
hydraulic in the 1840s. One was the Beckett Paper Co. The hydraulic remained 
a principal source of power for Hamilton industries through the 1870s when 
stationary steam engines became practical and affordable. Later, most of 
the hydraulic canal was covered and/or filled. The hydraulic attracted 
auto manufacturer Henry Ford to Hamilton after World War I, when he sought 
a site for a tractor factory. Ford built a plant — which soon converted 
to producing auto parts — at the north end of North Fifth Street so it 
could take advantage of power provided by a branch of the hydraulic. A 
Rossville hydraulic also was built, but never achieved the success of the 
Hamilton system. Following the disastrous 1913 flood in the Great Miami 
River Valley, residents realized that the only way to prevent future flooding 
was to deal with protection on a watershed basis. Citizens from all the 
major cities in the valley, Piqua, Troy, Dayton, Carlisle, Franklin, Miamisburg, 
Middletown, and Hamilton, gathered together to find a solution. They worked 
with legislative representatives to draft enabling legislation to create 
the Miami Conservancy District. It was passed by the state and signed into 
law by Governor James Cox. Although challenged several times in the courts, 
the laws withstood those attacks. The law and District have also withstood 
the tests of time. By 1915, the District hired an engineering staff, which 
developed plans for valley-long channel improvements, levees, and storage 
basins to temporarily retain excessive rains. The system was designed to 
withstand rains and flows that would be up to 40% greater than those of 
1913. Waters have been retained more than 1,000 times, thereby preventing 
flooding. Construction began in 1915 and was completed in 1923. The Miami 
Conservancy District was the first of its kind in the nation, and has been 
an example of flood control protection. It is unique for having been developed, 
built, and supported financially just by those who benefit. The Miami Conservancy 
District is financially supported by an assessment on each property that 
was affected by the 1913 waters, related to the present value of the property 
because it is not at risk of flooding. All the other areas within the District 
are assessed because they benefit by reducing or eliminating danger to 
infrastructure, commerce, and transportation. Hamilton is served by the 
Hamilton City School district. The district has underway a major $200 million 
capital program including construction of eight elementary schools, a freshman 
school, two completely renovated middle schools, and an upgraded high school 
with two new gyms, a new media center, six new classrooms and a new cafeteria. 
In 2002, President George W. Bush visited Hamilton and signed The No Child 
Left Behind Act into law at Hamilton High School.[23] Talawanda, Ross, 
and New Miami School Districts also serve corners of the city. Father Stephen 
T. Badin High School, a private Catholic high school of the Archdiocese 
of Cincinnati, and several Catholic elementary schools (St. Ann Catholic 
School, St. Peter in Chains School, St. Joseph Consolidated School, Sacred 
Heart of Jesus School and Queen of Peace School),[24] serve the city and 
surrounding area. Miami University, based in Oxford, Ohio, has a regional 
campus in the city. Miami University Hamilton opened in 1968 and now has 
more than [25] 5,000 students. It also has a campus in nearby Middletown, 
with about 2,700 students. The Lane Public Library is located in an architecturally 
significant building in the heart of Hamilton’s Historic German Village. 
Built in 1866 by local philanthropist, Clark Lane, Lane Library has the 
distinction of being the oldest public library west of the Alleghenies. 
Now in its 148th year, the library building has survived floods and fires, 
and has been improved by six separate renovations and expansion projects. 
It is a community focal point for Hamilton. A significant building renovation 
in 1995-1996 upgraded the library for the 21st century's technology while 
protecting its Victorian architectural character. The 25,000-square foot 
building houses several library administration departments as well as the 
Circulation, Information, Teen, and Children's Departments. It has a large 
local history room, which also has materials related to genealogy. Clark 
donated the first collection of materials to the library, approximately 
3,000 books. Today, the collection numbers over 123,000. In addition to 
popular books and research volumes, the library offers the community access 
to videos, DVDs, CDs, CD ROMs, puppets, audio books and eBooks. In the 
year 2000, more than 435,000 items were checked out of Clark Lane's library, 
and staff members answered over 48,500 reference questions. The Lane Public 
Library also features the Lane Libraries Community Technology Center, located 
on the ground floor of the historic Robinson-Schwenn Building at 10 Journal 
Square in downtown Hamilton. The center offers a high-tech collaborative 
work/play/create space with public use computers (both PC and Mac), high-end 
software, tablet and eReader demo displays, 3D printers and comfortable 
lounge-style seating with wifi available throughout. The Council consists 
of seven members who are elected in non-partisan elections at staggered 
intervals and serve four-year terms. They elect a mayor within the council, 
and together select and appoint a professional city manager to operate 
the city. Operating as the legislative branch of the City, the Council 
provides policy direction to the City Manager.[26] The judge of the municipal 
court is also an elected official.[26] The city's Council-Manager form 
of government was established in 1926, based then on election by proportional 
representation with a single transferable vote (STV).[27] This system was 
developed to try to meet the rapidly changing needs of cities with their 
growing immigrant populations. "The PR/STV ballot allows voters to rank 
order their choices in either at-large or multimember district elections. 
With each ballot ultimately counting toward the election of one candidate, 
voters' preferences can be transferred to second or subsequent choices 
if their most preferred candidate is already elected or has no chance of 
election, thus maximizing the proportion of effective votes and permitting 
minorities to win their share of seats."[27] Hamilton was one of several 
major Ohio cities that adopted the PR/STV form of elections in the early 
20th century; Ashtabula was the first in 1915. This system was considered 
more progressive than plurality voting, with winner take all, and the at-large 
election system found in some cities, which also benefited the majority 
and generally succeeded in preventing minorities from gaining office. Use 
of PR/STV resulted in more minorities, including women, being able to enter 
politics and attain positions on city councils which they likely otherwise 
would not have gained in at-large voting.[27] Under the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965, a significant minority is that representing 5% or more of the 
population. The success of PR/STV nationally (including in New York City 
for a time) led to a political backlash from bosses and parties that lost 
power. In Hamilton, opponents mounted numerous campaigns to repeal the 
charter, finally succeeding after four failed referendums in 12 years.[28] 
Since the city of Hamilton returned to plurality voting, the African-American 
minority has less frequently been able to win seats on the council.[28] 
In 2015, however, city council members include two women (white) and an 
African-American man; other members are white males.[26] The City Manager 
operates as chief executive officer, directing a workforce of more than 
675 permanent employees and a $400+ million budget. The city also maintains 
a Public Safety Director for the City, responsible for police protection, 
staffed by more than 110 full-time professionals, and fire protection, 
staffed by more than 110 full-time fire fighters.[26] West Side Little 
League in Hamilton, Ohio has been to the Little League World Series four 
times. Little Leaguers from Hamilton have made the trip to Williamsport 
in 1991, 1993, 2007, and 2010. Hamilton Little League has also won eight 
of the last nine state championships, and ten of the last twelve, as of
