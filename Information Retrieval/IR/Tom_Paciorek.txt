Thomas Marian Paciorek (/pəˈtʃɔːrɛk/ pǝ-CHOR-ek; born November 2, 1946) 
is a former outfielder and first baseman who spent 18 seasons in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) with the Los Angeles Dodgers (1970–1975), Atlanta 
Braves (1976–1978), Seattle Mariners (1978–1981), Chicago White Sox (1982–1985), 
New York Mets (1985) and Texas Rangers (1986–1987). He appeared twice in 
the postseason, with the National League (NL) Champion Dodgers in 1974 
and the American League (AL) West-winning White Sox in 1983. Following 
his retirement as an active player, he worked as a color commentator for 
various MLB clubs, most notably the White Sox where he was teamed with 
Ken Harrelson on telecasts throughout the 1990s. Paciorek is famously known 
by the nickname Wimpy which was given to him by Tom Lasorda after a dinner 
with minor league teammates in which he was the only one to order a hamburger 
instead of steak.[1] After graduating from St. Ladislaus High School in 
Hamtramck, Michigan, Paciorek played baseball and football for the University 
of Houston from 1965 to 1968. A defensive back, he was picked by the Miami 
Dolphins in the ninth round of the 1968 NFL Draft. As a part of the Houston 
Cougars baseball club, he was named to the All-Tournament team after the 
Cougars became the national runner-up in the 1967 College World Series. 
Paciorek's number was retired by the Cougars as one of only three in the 
history of the team. He was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1968, 
one of 14 players drafted by the Dodgers that year to reach the majors. 
A top prospect, he was The Sporting News' Minor League Player of the Year 
in 1972. He spent the 1973 through 1975 seasons as a fourth outfielder 
and pinch hitter. After hitting under .200 in 1975, he was traded to the 
Atlanta Braves as part of a trade for Dusty Baker. He hit .290 in a platoon 
role for Atlanta in 1976 but he struggled to duplicate those numbers the 
following year. The Braves released him after spring training in 1978, 
but signed him again just a week later. However, six weeks and only nine 
at bats later, the Braves gave him his release a second time. Paciorek 
then signed with the Seattle Mariners, where he finished the season hitting 
.299. Following two solid years as a platoon player, Paciorek put together 
a career season with the Mariners in the 1981 season. Playing full-time 
for the only time in his career, Paciorek batted .326, second in the American 
League, and was fourth in the AL in slugging percentage. He earned his 
only appearance to an All-Star team in 1981 and was 10th in the AL MVP 
race. In the offseason, the Mariners traded Paciorek to the Chicago White 
Sox for three players, none of whom would make an impact with Seattle. 
Paciorek hit over .300 his first two years with the Sox, and was part of 
Chicago's division championship team in 1983. With the White Sox in 1984, 
he set an unusual MLB record. Paciorek replaced Ron Kittle in left field 
in the fourth inning of a May 8 game with the Milwaukee Brewers – a game 
which then proceeded to last 25 innings, becoming the longest game in Major 
League history (as measured in time on the field). By the time the game 
ended the following day, Paciorek had amassed five hits in nine at bats, 
a record for most hits in a game by a player that did not start the game 
which still stands.[2] Several players have had four hits in a game as 
a substitute, most recently Quinton McCracken of the Arizona Diamondbacks 
in 2002.[3] He was traded to the New York Mets in 1985, then spent his 
final two years with the Texas Rangers. Tom was one of three brothers to 
play in the Majors. His younger brother Jim played for the Milwaukee Brewers 
in 1987, while older brother John played one game for the Houston Colt 
.45's (in which he went 3–3 and walked twice) in 1963. Paciorek has served 
as a broadcaster for several years since retiring as a player, with his 
most notable stint as the color commentator on White Sox television broadcasts 
alongside Ken Harrelson, who affectionately called him by his baseball 
nickname, "Wimpy", on-air. Paciorek broadcast for the White Sox from 1988 
to 1999, then called selected games for the Detroit Tigers in 2000 and 
the Seattle Mariners in 2001 before calling the Atlanta Braves on FSN South 
from 2002 to 2005. In 2006, he was the color commentator for the Washington 
Nationals, but his contract was not renewed for 2007.[4][5] He is fondly 
remembered amongst Nationals fans for his distinct pronunciation of "Alfonso 
Soriano," a Nationals outfielder that season: "Eelfahnso Soriaahno". In 
1992, Tom Paciorek was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports 
Hall of Fame.[6] In the spring of 2002, Paciorek told the Detroit Free 
Press in a report that priest Gerald Shirilla had molested him and three 
of his four brothers while working as a teacher at St. Ladislaus Catholic 
High School in Hamtramck in the 1960s. "I was molested by him for a period 
of four years," Paciorek is reported to have said. "I would refer to them 
as attacks. I would say there was at least a hundred of them." The former 
All-Star said he didn't tell anyone because no one would have believed 
him saying "When you're a kid, and you're not able to articulate, who's 
going to believe you?" and "The church back then was so powerful, there's 
nothing that a kid could do."[7] In 2016 Paciorek was named to the National
