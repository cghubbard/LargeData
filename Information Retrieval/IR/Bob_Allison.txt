William Robert "Bob" Allison (July 11, 1934 – April 9, 1995) was born in 
Raytown, Missouri and was a Major League Baseball outfielder and right-handed 
batter who played in the American League for the Washington Senators / 
Minnesota Twins from 1958 to 1970. A gifted all-around athlete, Allison 
attended the University of Kansas for two years and was a star outfielder 
on the baseball team and fullback on the football team. In his Major League 
career, he hit 30 or more home runs three times and 20 or more in eight 
different seasons. Although he struck out often like many sluggers, reaching 
the century mark in strikeouts in five seasons, he received more than his 
share of walks and despite a mediocre career .255 batting average, Allison 
finished with a lifetime on-base percentage (OBP) of .358 and he finished 
in the top 10 in OBP in four seasons.[1] Allison wasn't an especially fast 
player, but he was among the most feared base-runners of his time in hustling 
out numerous doubles and triples – leading the league in triples in 1959 
(with 9) and finishing in the top 10 twice in doubles (1960 & 1964) and 
four times in triples (1959, 1962, 1967 and 1968).[2] At the three outfield 
positions he showed good range, finishing in the top five in range factor 
per nine innings five times, and his strong arm was rated as one of the 
best in the league. He also played a solid first base late at his career 
and his competitive attitude was highly praised by teammates and opponents. 
Despite his skill in the field, which saw him finish in the top 5 in the 
American League in outfield assists three times (1961, 1962 and 1965) and 
outfield putouts twice (1959 and 1963), his range also produced many errors 
and Allison led the league with 11 errors in 1960, finished second twice 
(1959 and 1963), and finished fourth in errors by a first baseman in 1964.[3] 
After leaving the University of Kansas at the age of 20, Allison was signed 
by the Senators as an amateur free agent before the start of the 1955 season.[4] 
After signing, he was assigned to the Hagerstown Packets of the B-level 
Piedmont League where he hit only .256 in 122 games.[5] The following year, 
he was promoted to the Charlotte Hornets in the single-A South Atlantic 
League. Although he would improve his power numbers, hitting 12 home runs 
and 6 triples, his batting average would dip to .233. Allison would then 
spend 1957 and 1958 playing for the Chattanooga Lookouts of the AA Southern 
League and he would raise batting average and slugging percentage to .307 
and .446 respectively in 1958 (both highs in his minor league career). 
On September 16, 1958, Allison made his major league debut, batted lead-off, 
and got a single in four at-bats in a 5–1 loss to the Cleveland Indians.[6] 
In 1959, Allison went north with the Senators and he batted .261 with 30 
home runs and 85 runs batted in; led the league in triples (9), was named 
to the All-Star team, received a smattering of MVP votes, and was honored 
by being voted Rookie of the Year. Allison would experience a "sophomore 
slump" in 1960 with an across-the-board drop in his offensive statistics. 
However he would come back strong in 1961, hitting 29 home runs and 105 
RBI, although his batting average would drop for the second year in a row 
(to .245). When the Senators moved to Minnesota in 1961, Allison became 
a local favorite and along with teammate Harmon Killebrew made one of the 
most dangerous one-two punches in baseball. In 1963, Allison had 25 doubles, 
35 home runs, 91 RBI, led the league in runs scored (99) and in OPS (.911), 
and earned his second All-Star berth. In addition, he became the first 
of four Twins to lead the league in WAR, a stat that measures a player's 
overall production both in the field and at the plate, (along with teammate 
Zoilo Versalles, Rod Carew, and current Twin Joe Mauer) and the only one 
not to win the MVP in the same season (finishing a distant 15th behind 
winner Elston Howard and behind teamamates Camilo Pascual, Earl Battey, 
and Killebrew on the 1963 ballot). He followed this up in 1964 with a 32-home 
run 86 RBI performance that got him named to his third and final All-Star 
team, this time at first base. The next year, Allison suffered a broken 
left hand when he was hit by a pitch and missed 91 games, but returned 
at the end of the season to knock a pinch-hit three-run homer, sending 
the New York Yankees to the cellar in the American League. During the Twins 
1965 World Series season, Allison had a down year, hitting only .233 in 
135 games, and continued his poor production versus the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
reaching base only 4 times (two walks, a double, and a home run) and striking 
out 9 times in 16 at-bats, the last of which was against Sandy Koufax for 
the final out in Game 7 of the 1965 World Series. However, he did have 
a memorable Game 2 of the Series. His bases-loaded double against Sandy 
Koufax and a truly memorable backhand diving catch of a Jim Lefebvre fly 
ball were the main contributors to the Twins victory. This catch has been 
called the best catch in Twins history and one of the most spectacular 
catches seen in the Series. Allison's slide at the plate would continue 
into the 1966 season and he would play in only 70 games and hit .233. However, 
he would return in a big way in 1967, managing to hit .258 with 24 home 
runs with 75 RBI in a year which the league as a whole only hit .236. In 
13 seasons, Allison finished in the top ten in home runs eight times (1959, 
1961–65, 1967–68). Particularly memorable home run feats included combining 
with Harmon Killebrew to become the first pair to hit grand slams in the 
same inning on July 18, 1962,[7] hitting home runs in three consecutive 
at-bats on May 17, 1963,[8] and teaming with Killebrew, Tony Oliva, and 
Jimmie Hall to hit four consecutive home runs on May 2, 1964.[9] During 
his baseball career, he worked during the off season in sales for Coca-Cola 
Bottling Midwest Co. in suburban Minneapolis and after retirement, he continued 
with that business, becoming a plant manager and a sales manager Coca-Cola's 
Twin Cities Marketing Division. Thirteen years after his retirement, Allison 
began noticing problems with his coordination during a 1987 old-timers 
game at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Running and even catching the 
ball became difficult. Following two years of doctor visits to learn what 
was wrong, the diagnosis was finally made — Allison was suffering from 
a progressive sporadic ataxia known as Olivo-Ponto cerebellar atrophy (OPCA).[10] 
In 1990, Allison helped found the Bob Allison Ataxia Research Center at 
the University of Minnesota along with his wife Betty, sons Mark, Kirk, 
and Kyle, and former Twins' teammates Jim Kaat and Frank Quilici. He continued 
to battle this rare degenerative neurological disease for eight years, 
eventually losing his ability to walk, talk, write, and feed himself. Allison 
died of complications from ataxia on April 9, 1995 at the age of 60 in 
his Rio Verde, Arizona home.[11] Following his death, the Minnesota Twins 
created the Bob Allison Award for the Twins player who exemplifies determination, 
hustle, tenacity, competitive spirit and leadership both on and off the
