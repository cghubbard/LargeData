Osvaldo José Virgil Pichardo (born May 17, 1932) is a former professional 
baseball player and coach who was the first Dominican to play in Major 
League Baseball.[1] He was a utilityman who played in MLB between 1956 
and 1969 for the New York Giants (1956–57), Detroit Tigers (1958; 1960–61), 
Kansas City Athletics (1961), Baltimore Orioles (1962), Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1965) and San Francisco Giants (1966; 1969). Basically a third baseman, 
Virgil played all positions except pitcher and center field. He batted 
and threw right-handed, was 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and weighed 174 
pounds (79 kg). Virgil was born in Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic. His 
family emigrated to the United States when he was 13 and settled in The 
Bronx, where Virgil graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School.[2] He served 
in the United States Marines from 1950–52,[2] and began his 17-season professional 
playing career in 1953. On September 23, 1956, he became the first person 
from his native country to play in the Majors when he started for the Giants 
at third base against the Philadelphia Phillies. Almost two years later, 
on June 6, 1958, Virgil became the first player of African descent to take 
the field for the Tigers,[1] again starting at third base, this time against 
the Washington Senators. In a nine-season big-league career, Virgil posted 
a .231 batting average with 174 hits, 14 home runs and 73 RBI in 324 games 
played. After his playing career ended, Virgil spent 19 seasons as a coach 
for the Giants (1969–72; 1974–75); Montréal Expos (1976–81); San Diego 
Padres (1982–85); and Seattle Mariners (1986–88). From 1977–88, he served 
as the third-base coach on the staff of Baseball Hall of Fame manager Dick 
Williams. His son, catcher Ozzie, Jr., played in all or parts of 11 MLB 
seasons (1980–90) and was a two-time National League All-Star. Osvaldo 
Virgil National Airport serves the Monte Cristi Province, in the north 
of the Dominican Republic. This airport was opened in 2006 for tourism
