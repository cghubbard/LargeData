Fayette County is a county located in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Fayette 
County is located in southwestern Pennsylvania, adjacent to Maryland and 
West Virginia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 136,606.[1] Its 
county seat is Uniontown.[2] The county was created on September 26, 1783, 
from part of Westmoreland County and named after the Marquis de Lafayette.[3] 
Fayette County is part of the Pittsburgh, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. 
The first Europeans in Fayette County were explorers, who had used an ancient 
American Indian trail that bisected the county on their journey across 
the Appalachian Mountains. In 1754, when control of the area was still 
in dispute between France and Great Britain (both disregarding the indigenous 
tribes who had long occupied the territory), 22-year-old George Washington 
fought against the French at Jumonville Glen and Fort Necessity. British 
forces under Washington and General Edward Braddock improved roads throughout 
the region, making the future Fayette County an important supply route. 
During the American Revolution, Fayette County was plagued by attacks from 
British-allied Indians and remained isolated as a frontier region. Also 
retarding settlement was a border dispute with Virginia; Virginia's District 
of West Augusta and Pennsylvania's Westmoreland County both claimed the 
area. In 1780 the dispute was settled by the federal government in favor 
of Pennsylvania, and Fayette County was formed from Westmoreland County 
in 1783. Fayette County settlers provided the new United States government 
with an early test of authority in the 1793 Whiskey Rebellion, when farmers 
rebelled against tax collectors to protest a new liquor tax. President 
George Washington called out the militias to restore order. Fayette County 
continued to be important to travelers in the early 1800s. The National 
Road provided a route through the mountains of the county for settlers 
heading west. The shipyards in Brownsville on the Monongahela River built 
ships for both the domestic and international trade. As Pittsburgh developed 
its industries in the mid-19th century, Fayette County become a center 
of coal mining and coke production. From the 1880s to the early 1900s, 
the area's great expansion in in steel production became nationally important, 
and labor unions shaped national policies. Both new European immigrants 
and African Americans in the Great Migration from the rural South were 
attracted to the Pittsburgh area for industrial jobs. The historic Scottish 
and German farming communities established in the earlier 19th century 
were soon overshadowed by the wave of immigrants from Southern and Eastern 
Europe. The region's wealth has been concentrated largely among the old 
English and Scottish families who had established businesses and political 
power in Pittsburgh prior to and in the advent of industrialization, often 
building the new manufacturing concerns, as did Andrew Carnegie. By World 
War II, Fayette County had a new unionized working class that enjoyed increased 
prosperity. In the 1950s, however, the coal industry fell into decline. 
In the 1970s, the restructuring and collapse of American steel resulted 
in a massive loss of industrial jobs and hard times in the area. The population 
has declined since the peak in 1940, as residents have had to move elsewhere 
for work. The loss of union jobs caused many working families to drop out 
of the middle class. Only a few mines are being worked in the 21st century, 
but natural resources remain crucial to the local economy. The region is 
slowly transitioning toward the service sector, with an increase in jobs 
in fields such as telemarketing. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the 
county has a total area of 798 square miles (2,070 km2), of which 790 square 
miles (2,000 km2) is land and 8.0 square miles (21 km2) (1.0%) is water.[4] 
The western portion of the county contains rolling foothills and two valleys 
along the Monongahela and Youghiogheny rivers. The eastern portion of the 
county is highly mountainous and forested. Many coal mines are located 
within the area.[5] As of the census of 2010,[11] there were 136,606 people, 
59,969 households, and 41,198 families residing in the county. The population 
density was 188 people per square mile (73/km²). There were 66,490 housing 
units at an average density of 84 per square mile (32/km²). The racial 
makeup of the county was 93.30% White, 4.71% Black or African American, 
0.11% Native American, 0.22% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.11% from 
other races, and 2.33% from two or more races. 1.38% of the population 
were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 19.8% were of German, 13.2% Italian, 
11.4% Irish, 9.2% American, 8.4% Polish, 7.9% English and 6.6% Slovak ancestry 
according to Census 2000. There were 59,969 households out of which 28.70% 
had children under the age of 18 living with them, 51.80% were married 
couples living together, 12.40% had a female householder with no husband 
present, and 31.30% were non-families. 28.00% of all households were made 
up of individuals and 14.50% had someone living alone who was 65 years 
of age or older. The average household size was 2.43 and the average family 
size was 2.96. In the county, the population was spread out with 22.70% 
under the age of 18, 7.70% from 18 to 24, 27.20% from 25 to 44, 24.20% 
from 45 to 64, and 18.10% who were 65 years of age or older. The median 
age was 40 years. For every 100 females there were 91.80 males. For every 
100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.60 males. A study released in 
2009 by PathWays PA, in partnership with the Pennsylvania Department of 
Labor and Industry, found that 35% of families in Fayette County were economically 
distressed, that is, failing to earn a wage that would adequately provide 
food, shelter, child care, health care, and other basic necessities.[12] 
According to research by The Center for Rural Pennsylvania, which is a 
legislative Agency of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, the poverty rate 
for Fayette County was 20.2% in 2014.[13] The statewide poverty rate was 
13.6% in 2014. The 2012 childhood poverty rate by school district was: 
Albert Gallatin Area School District – 61.4%, Brownsville Area School District 
– 64.7%, Connellsville Area School District – 55.7%, Frazier School District 
– 40.5%, Laurel Highlands School District – 59.9% and Uniontown Area School 
District – 55.1% of pupils living at 185% or below than the Federal Poverty 
Level.[14] Fayette County's live birth rate was 1,877 births in 1990. The 
Fayette County's live birth rate in 2000 was 1,538 births, while in 2011 
it had declined to 1,366 babies.[15] Over the past 50 years (1960 to 2010), 
rural Pennsylvania saw a steady decline in both the number and proportion 
of residents under 18 years old. In 1960, 1.06 million rural residents, 
or 35 percent of the rural population, were children. While Fayette is 
included in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, 47.9% of the population in 
2010 was designated as rural by the U.S. Census Bureau.[16] The County 
of Fayette is governed by a three-member publicly elected commission. The 
three commissioners serve in both executive and legislative capacities. 
By state law, the commission must have a minority party member, guaranteeing 
a political split. Each member serves a four-year term. Current commissioners 
are Democrat Vince Vicites and Republicans David Lohr and Angela Zimmerlink. 
In October 2015, Sidney Bush, the first African American elected to county 
office, was sworn in as controller. He is a longtime county employee.[17] 
The Fayette County Court of Common Pleas serves as the primary judicial 
arm in the region. Judges are elected to ten-year terms in accordance with 
Commonwealth law. Additionally, district judges serve throughout the county 
and rule on minor offenses. Current judges are President Judge John F. 
Wagner, Jr., Steve P. Leskinen, Nancy Vernon, Linda Cordaro, and Joseph 
M. George, Jr.[18] As of November 2008, there are 91,386 registered voters 
in Fayette County.[19] Fayette County tends to be Democratic-leaning in 
statewide and national elections. While Democratic politics are entrenched 
because of a strong union history, the county is generally socially conservative. 
Along with the rest of Western Pennsylvania, the county has been trending 
steadily towards the Republicans since 1996.[20] At the presidential level, 
the Democratic candidate won by over 15 points in every election from 1932 
to 2000 except 1972, usually winning by 25 points or more. Since then, 
the Republican party has continued to improve in each successive elections, 
and the Republican nominee won the county in 2008 and 2012 even as Barack 
Obama carried the state and the nation. Serve 2 year terms in Pennsylvania

2015, Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale reported that 23 public 
schools in the County are among the 561 academically challenged schools 
that have been overlooked by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.[22][23] 
He also reported the Pennsylvania Department of Education failed to take 
any action to remediate the poorly performing schools to raise student 
academic achievement or to provide them with targeted professional assistance.[24] 
The failing schools were operated by: Albert Gallatin Area School District 
4 schools; Brownsville Area School District 3 schools; Connellsville Area 
School District 9 schools; Laurel Highlands School District 4 schools and 
Uniontown Area School District 3 schools. Fifteen (15) public schools in 
Fayette County were on the bottom 15% academic achievement schools list 
published by the Pennsylvania Department of Education each school year. 
Students attending these schools may be eligible for Opportunity Scholarships 
to attend a better performing school in a neighboring school district or 
a private school.[25] The scholarships are limited to those students whose 
family's income is less than $60,000 annually, with another $12,000 allowed 
per dependent. Maximum scholarship award is $8,500, with special education 
students receiving up to $15,000 for a year's tuition. Parents pay any 
difference between the scholarship amount and the receiving school's tuition 
rate. Funding for the scholarships comes from donations by businesses which 
receive a state tax credit for donating. In 2015, Albert Gallatin Area 
School District had 5 schools on the list. Brownsville Area School District 
3 schools on the statewide lowest achievement list. Connellsville Area 
School District 5 of its elementary schools on the list. Uniontown Area 
School District 2 schools: Lafayette Elementary School and Lafayette Middle 
School on the lowest achievement list.[26] The Pennsylvania House of Representatives 
ordered school district consolidation study, which was performed by The 
Education Management Group, LLC. It was provoked by a 14.30% decline of 
the 2000–01 pupil population in the County's six public school districts 
by 2011. Multiple state projections found a continual decline over the 
next ten years due to a declining birth rate.[27] Fayette County has two 
Career and Technology Centers that appear to overlap. If the Connellsville 
Career and Technical Center were eliminated, the savings in salaries and 
benefits alone would be significantly greater than $2 million, not counting 
the savings in utilities from closure of the facility. Savings was projected 
to be in the tens of million each year, largely due to shedding duplicate 
administration positions.[28] By 2015, no Fayette County public school 
district consolidations had occurred. Students may attend any of the 13 
public cyber charter schools operating in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
in 2015.[29][30] The cyber charter schools provide the pupil with a computer 
and internet access, as well as, other materials needed. As with all public 
schools in Pennsylvania, students must participate in the annual school 
testing of the Pennsylvania System of School Assessments (PSSAs) (3rd–8th 
grades) or the Keystone Exams (9th–12th grades). Fayette County is served 
by Intermediate Unit #1 which provides a wide variety of services to public, 
charter and private schools in the region. Early screening, special educations 
services, speech and hearing therapy and driver education are available. 
Services for children during the preschool years are provided without cost 
to their families when the child is determined to meet eligibility requirements. 
The IU1 also provides the state mandated multiple background screenings 
for potential school employees. A variety of professional development services 
are also available to the schools' employees. [2] While Fayette County 
is a generally rural area and is not directly tied into the interstate 
system, it features four-lane access to the city of Pittsburgh and several 
of its major suburban areas. State highway plans call for the establishment 
of direct freeway connections with Pittsburgh to the north and Morgantown, 
West Virginia to the south. The primary provider of mass transportation 
within the region is Fayette Area Coordinated Transportation, which features 
local bus routes as well as four times-daily commuter service to Pittsburgh. 
Amtrak rail service along the Chicago-to-Washington-via-Cleveland Capitol 
Limited route stops at Connellsville Station. General aviation services 
are also provided at the Joseph A. Hardy Connellsville Airport. Under Pennsylvania 
law, there are four types of incorporated municipalities: cities, boroughs, 
townships, and, in at most two cases, towns. The following cities, boroughs 
and townships are located in Fayette County: Census-designated places are 
geographical areas designated by the U.S. Census Bureau for the purposes 
of compiling demographic data. They are not actual jurisdictions under 
Pennsylvania law. Other unincorporated communities, such as villages, may 
be listed here as well. The population ranking of the following table is 
based on the 2010 census of Fayette County.[32] † county seat In 1967 Uniontown 
was the birthplace of the McDonald’s Big Mac sandwich.[40][41] In 2014, 
Fayette County received an impact fee disbursement of $1,327,202.57. The 
top county recipient statewide was Washington County which received $6,512,570.65 
in 2014.[42] In 2014, there were 207 marcellus shale wells in Fayette County.[43] 
Fayette County is also crisscrossed (both north-south and east-west) by 
several major gas transmission pipelines operated by Texas Eastern.[47][48] 
Unlike other states, under Pennsylvania state tax policy, natural gas and 
oil pipelines are exempted from property taxes.[49][50] Pipeline companies 
prohibit development within the 100-foot-wide right-of-way, thereby limiting 
future development options for the landowner. This limits future potential 
property tax revenues for the local taxing entities including the county, 
the boroughs and the school districts, by constraining future land development.[51]
