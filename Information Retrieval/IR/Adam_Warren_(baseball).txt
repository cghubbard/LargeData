Baseball draft, but he did not sign, instead returning to UNC for his senior 
season.[5] After Warren's senior season, Warren was drafted in the fourth 
round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Yankees, 
with the 136th overall selection.[1][3] Warren signed with the Yankees, 
and made his professional debut that season with the Staten Island Yankees 
of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League.[3] Warren started the 
2010 season with the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State

24th Triple-A All-Star Game.[9] Warren made his major-league debut for 
the Yankees on June 29, replacing an injured CC Sabathia in the Yankees'

double in the top of the 2nd inning and a solo home run to Paul Konerko 
to lead off the top of the 3rd inning. He was relieved by David Phelps 
in the top of the 3rd, and would receive a no-decision as the Yankees lost 
the game 14–7.[10] Warren was sent back down to Triple-A the very next 
day. Warren was called up to the Yankees on September 1, 2012, when the 
big league rosters expanded.[11] On May 13, 2013, Warren got his first 
career save after pitching 4 scoreless innings of relief in a 7-0 win against 
the Cleveland Indians. He was optioned to Triple-A on June 14, 2013 after 
throwing 6 scoreless innings in the Yankees' 3–2 18-inning loss against 
the Oakland Athletics on the previous day. During the 2014 season Warren 
emerged as a key part of the Yankees bullpen, pitching 78 2/3 innings to 
a 2.97 ERA over the course of the season. Despite pitching in the bullpen 
through most of the previous two seasons, Adam Warren began the 2015 season 
in the Yankees starting rotation. Warren pitched well in the rotation going
