Stolen bases were not officially noted in a baseball game's summary until 
1886, and it was not until 1888 that it officially earned a place in the 
box score.[1] The modern rule for stolen bases was adopted in 1898.[1] 
While some sources do not include stolen base records before 1898 because 
they are difficult to compare to the era after 1898, as the sourcing on 
this list indicates, Major League Baseball continues to recognize them.[2] 
Players denoted in italics are still actively contributing to the record 
noted. (r) denotes a player's rookie season. The pre-modern single-season 
mark for stolen bases is 138 by Hugh Nicol in 1887. In the modern era, 
Ty Cobb set a single-season mark of 96 stolen bases in 1915[24] that lasted 
until it was broken by Maury Wills with 104 in 1962. A new modern mark 
was set by Lou Brock with 118 in 1974, and again by Rickey Henderson with 
130 in 1982. Henderson and Vince Coleman are the only players to record 
three 100-steal seasons in the modern era. Coleman is the only player to 
do it three seasons in a row, much less in the first three season of his 
career, as well as the only player to record 100 steals as a rookie. Under 
the pre-modern rule, George Gore stole 7 bases in a game in 1881, a mark 
that was tied by "Sliding Billy" Hamilton in 1894. In the modern era, Eddie 
Collins stole 6 bases in a game on two occasions, both in September 1912, 
a mark that stood alone for nearly eight decades before being tied by Otis 
Nixon (1991), Eric Young (1996), and Carl Crawford (2009). Max Carey established 
a mark in 1922 of 31 consecutive stolen bases without being caught,[27] 
which stood until it was broken by Davey Lopes' streak of 38 in 1975. Lopes' 
mark was in turn surpassed by Vince Coleman with 50 consecutive stolen 
bases in 1988. Under pre-modern rules, "Sliding Billy" Hamilton amassed 
six separate seasons of 70-plus stolen bases over his career. In the modern 
era, Ty Cobb established a mark of three such seasons that stood (though 
tied by Lou Brock and Omar Moreno) until it was broken by Tim Raines in 
1984. In 1986, Raines reached six seasons of 70-plus steals, all consecutive 
(a record), but Rickey Henderson notched his seventh such season in 1989. 
In 1924, Eddie Collins tied Billy Hamilton's pre-modern mark of ten seasons 
with 40-plus stolen bases. A year later, Max Carey also tied the record. 
The record was broken by Lou Brock in 1974. Brock eventually recorded a 
thirteenth 40-steal season, but was in turn surpassed by Rickey Henderson 
in 1993. Henderson eventually stole 40 bases in sixteen separate seasons. 
Those marked in bold have at least 600 career stolen base attempts. Of 
those, Joe Morgan was the first to retire with a career stolen base percentage 
of at least 80%. His mark was successively surpassed by Davey Lopes, Willie
