As player As coach As manager Lee Man-soo (Hangul: 이만수, Hanja: 李萬洙; born 
September 9, 1958 in Cheorwon, Gangwon-do, South Korea), also spelled as 
Man Soo Lee, is a former Korea Professional Baseball catcher and manager. 
After a distinguished career as a professional player in South Korea from 
1982–1997,[1] Lee moved on to coaching in 1998, including positions on 
the coaching staff of the Chicago White Sox,[2] and came back to South 
Korea in 2006 to serve as a bench coach for the Wyverns. Upon graduation 
from Hanyang University in 1982, Lee made an agreement with the Korea Baseball 
Organization to play for one of the new pro league's teams instead of remaining 
in the amateur league. Prior to the inaugural Korean professional baseball 
season, Lee was finally signed by the Samsung Lions. In the first game 
of the KBO pro league on March 27, 1982, Lee hit the first home run in 
Korean professional baseball history against the MBC Chungyong. Lee was 
a regular catcher of the Lions during the 1982 season and helped his team 
to reach to the inaugural Korean Series, where the Lions lost to the OB 
Bears, 4–1–1. Lee, nicknamed "Hulk" and "Babe Ruth of Korea" for his power 
and home run ability, was a full-time catcher for 16 seasons with the Samsung 
Lions, hitting 252 home runs and knocking in 861 RBIs during his career. 
In 1983, he won hist first home run title and was named League MVP, and 
the next year became the league's first triple crown winner as the leader 
in three major offensive categories ― home runs (23), runs batted in (80) 
and batting average (.340).[3] His Home Run and RBI totals also led the 
league in 1985. Gold Gloves came in 5 straight years, 1983–1987, and he 
appeared in 12 All-Star games. Lee's ultimate career home run total, 252, 
remained the record until Jang Jong-Hoon of the Hanwha Eagles hit his 253rd 
on May 23, 1999.[4] After retiring in 1997, Lee began his coaching career 
in the United States as the hitting coach for the Class A Kinston Indians 
in 1998. He moved to the White Sox organization in 1999, and served as 
the first base coach for the White Sox AAA affiliate Charlotte Knights 
until assuming his bullpen position with the big club in 2000. From 2000 
to 2006, Lee was a coaching staff for the Chicago White Sox, the first 
Korean to coach in the major leagues. In 2005, as a coach for the White 
Sox, he earned a World Series ring following the 2005 World Series.[5] 
After the 2006 season, Lee returned to South Korea and signed a two-year 
contract with the SK Wyverns as the club's bench coach on October 30, 2006. 
On August 18, 2011, SK Wyverns manager Kim Sung-keun was sacked following 
his decision to retire from coaching after the 2011 season. Kim's dismissal 
came just one day after the 68-year-old manager announced his decision 
to step down from his post at the end of the season, and Lee was named
