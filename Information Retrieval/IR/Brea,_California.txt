Brea (meaning "oil" or "tar" in Spanish) is a city in Orange County, California. 
The population as of the 2010 census was 39,282. The city began as a center 
of crude oil production, was later propelled by citrus production, and 
is now an important retail center because of the large Brea Mall and the 
recently redeveloped Brea Downtown. Brea is also known for its extensive 
public art program which began in 1975 and continues today with over 140 
artworks in the collection placed and located throughout the city. Brea's 
public art program has been used as a model and inspiration for many public 
art programs across the United States The area was visited on July 29, 
1769 by the Spanish Portolá expedition - first Europeans to see inland 
parts of Alta California. The party camped in Brea Canyon, near a large 
native village and a small pool of clean water.[8] A historical marker 
dedicated to his visit stands in Brea Canyon just north of town. The village 
of Olinda was founded in present-day Carbon Canyon at the beginning of 
the 19th century and many entrepreneurs came to the area searching for 
"black gold" (petroleum). In 1894, the owner of the land, Abel Stearns, 
sold 1,200 acres (4.9 km2) to the west of Olinda to the newly created Union 
Oil Company of California, and by 1898 many nearby hills began sporting 
wooden oil-drilling towers on the newly discovered Brea-Olinda Oil Field. 
In 1908 the village of Randolph, named for railway engineer Epes Randolph, 
was founded just south of Brea Canyon for the oil workers and their families. 
Baseball legend Walter Johnson grew up in Olinda at the start of the 20th 
century where he worked in the surrounding oil fields as a youth.[9] The 
villages of Olinda and Randolph grew and merged as the economy boomed, 
and on January 19, 1911, the town's map was filed under the new name of 
Brea, from the Spanish language word for natural asphalt (also called bitumen, 
pitch or tar). With a population of 752, Brea was incorporated on February 
23, 1917, as the eighth official city of Orange County. As oil production 
declined, some agricultural development took place, especially lemon and 
orange groves. In the 1920s, the Brea Chamber of Commerce promoted the 
city with the slogan “Oil, Oranges, and Opportunity.”[10] In 1950 Brea 
had a population of 3,208. The citrus groves gave way gradually to industrial 
parks and residential development. In 1956, Carl N. Karcher opened the 
first two Carl's Jr. restaurants in Anaheim, California and Brea, California. 
The opening of the Orange Freeway (57) and the Brea Mall in the 1970s spurred 
further residential growth, including large planned developments east of 
the 57 Freeway in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. In the late 1990s, a 50-acre 
(200,000 m2) swath of downtown Brea centered on Brea Boulevard and Birch 
Street was heavily redeveloped into a shopping and entertainment area with 
movie theaters, sidewalk cafes, a live comedy club from The Improv chain, 
numerous shops and restaurants, and a weekly farmer's market. It is locally 
known and signed as Downtown Brea. Sunset magazine named Brea one of the 
five best suburbs to live in the Western United States in early 2006.[11]

of 12.1 square miles (31 km2). 12.1 square miles (31 km2) of it is land

Mediterranean climate, abbreviated "Csa" on climate maps.[12] Brea is governed 
by a mayor-council system. The five member City Council is elected for 
four-year terms in elections every two years to fill alternately two and 
three seats.[13] The Council is made up of the Mayor, the Mayor Pro Tem 
and three Councilmembers.[14] The Council elects a Mayor from the current 
councilmembers to serve a one-year term as Mayor. The City Council hires

and Human Services Commission; Cultural Arts Commission and Traffic Committee.[13]
