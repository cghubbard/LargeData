As player As manager As coach Harry Ralston "Bud" Black (born June 30, 
1957) is an American former professional baseball player, coach, and and 
current manager of the Colorado Rockies. He played in Major League Baseball 
as a pitcher from 1981 through 1995. He coached the Anaheim Angels / Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim from 2000 through 2006, and managed the San Diego 
Padres from 2007 through 2015. He was named the National League Manager 
of the Year in 2010. Black is a graduate of Mark Morris High School in 
Longview, Washington. Black played two years at Lower Columbia College 
in Longview. For his junior and senior years, he played at San Diego State.[1] 
Black pitched fifteen seasons in the majors, most notably for the Kansas 
City Royals, winning 121 games in his career and was part of the starting 
rotation for the Royals team that won the 1985 World Series. He also played 
professionally for the Seattle Mariners, Cleveland Indians, Toronto Blue 
Jays and San Francisco Giants.[2] Black was the starting pitcher for the 
Royals during the famous George Brett pine tar incident, and was the pitcher 
who gave up Reggie Jackson's 500th career home run and Mike Piazza's first 
career home run. In between, Black pitched for the Leones del Caracas of 
the Venezuela Winter League and was a member of the 1982 Caribbean Series 
champion team. Black was the pitching coach of the Anaheim Angels/Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim from 2000-2006 under Manager Mike Scioscia. As the Angels 
pitching coach, Black won a World Series ring in 2002 against the San Francisco 
Giants. In October 2006, Brian Sabean, general manager of the Giants, interviewed 
Black for the Giants' vacant managerial position.[3] After the position 
went to Padres manager Bruce Bochy, Black became a candidate for the Padres 
job, and was officially hired on November 8, 2006. Despite a last place 
finish for the Padres in 2008, Black returned to finish his contract in 
2009. During the 2009 season, Black was given a contract extension for 
the 2010 season with a club option for 2011. During the 2010 season, the 
Padres gave Black another three-year extension through 2013, with club 
options in 2014 and 2015.[4] In 2010, Black presided over the worst collapse 
in Padres history when they went on a ten-game losing streak with a little 
over a month left in the season, went 12-16 in September and squandered 
a 6 1/2 game lead over the Giants for the NL West title. Black nonetheless 
was the winner of the 2010 National League Manager of the Year Award, edging 
Dusty Baker of the Cincinnati Reds in voting by a single point.[5] Black 
is only the third former full-time pitcher to win a Manager of the Year 
Award, joining Tommy Lasorda and Larry Dierker. On June 15, 2015, Black 
was fired after eight-plus seasons with the Padres after the team started 
2015 at 32â€“33 and was six games behind in the National League West.[6] 
He finished with a record of 649 wins and 713 losses.[7] On October 28, 
2015, The Washington Post reported that the Washington Nationals intended 
to hire Black as their new manager following the 2015 World Series, replacing 
fired manager Matt Williams.[8] However, it was later reported that he 
would not be getting the job.[9] Black turned down the Nationals offer, 
which he considered to be too low.[10] On November 25, 2015, it was announced 
that Black would be returning to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim to serve 
as a special assistant to the new General Manager, Billy Eppler.[11] Black 
previously served as a pitching coach for the team from 2000-2006. On November 
7, 2016, the Colorado Rockies announced they hired Black as their new manager.[12] 
Black was born to Canadian parents in Northern California. He has a wife, 
Nanette and two daughters. His wife is a pediatric ICU nurse. His older 
daughter attended Oregon State University and is currently an interior 
designer while his younger, a collegiate gymnast, graduated from the University
