Wilmer David "Vinegar Bend" Mizell (August 13, 1930 – February 21, 1999) 
was an American left-handed pitcher in major league baseball who went on 
to serve three terms as a Republican U.S. congressman from North Carolina 
from 1969 to 1975. He represented North Carolina's 5th congressional district, 
including Winston-Salem. Mizell was born near Vinegar Bend, Alabama, the 
source of his nickname. He was reared in nearby Leakesville, Mississippi, 
where he graduated from high school in 1949. He was a professional pitcher 
between 1949 and 1963, although he served in the United States Army during 
1953 and 1954. "Vinegar Bend" began his Major League Baseball career with 
the St. Louis Cardinals in 1952, continuing through 1953, and then again 
(following military service) from 1956-60. Mizell then joined the Pittsburgh 
Pirates from 1960–1962, winning one championship, and spent time with the 
expansion New York Mets in 1962 before retiring. In a nine-season career, 
Mizell was 90-88 with a 3.85 ERA in 268 games, 230 of which were starts. 
He pitched 61 complete games, including 15 shutouts. He allowed 654 earned 
runs and struck out 918 in 1528 and 2/3 innings pitched. After leaving 
baseball, Mizell worked in sales and public relations for the Pepsi-Cola 
company in Winston-Salem until 1967. Mizell entered North Carolina politics 
in the 1960s. He was elected to the Davidson County board of commissioners 
in 1966. He was the chairman of the board for the two years when he was 
a member. In 1968, Mizell, a Republican, was elected to represent the 5th 
District in the 91st United States Congress. A previous Republican candidate, 
G. Fred Steele, Jr., had polled 46.9 percent of the vote in District 5 
in 1966; Steele's showing helped prepare the district for a party transformation 
in 1968. Mizell defeated Democratic nominee Smith Bagley, an R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Company official, 84,905 (52.4 percent) to 77,112 (47.6 percent). 
The previous 5th District representative, Democrat Nick Galifianakis, was 
moved to the 4th District for the 1968 elections. Mizell was the first 
Republican to be elected in decades from the 5th District, which was based 
in Winston-Salem and included much of the northwestern part of the state. 
He was one of the most popular congressmen in Washington and one of the 
most conservative. In 1970, Mizell defeated Democrat James G. White, 68,937 
(58.1 percent) to 49,663 (41.9 percent). In 1972, he trounced former liberal 
Arkansas Congressman Brooks Hays, who had moved to North Carolina, 101,375 
(64.8 percent) to 54,986 (35.2 percent). Mizell may have thought that his 
1972 margin would insulate him from further Democratic challenges in 1974. 
The Watergate scandal affected Republican House members. Mizell was unseated 
by Democrat Stephen L. Neal, 64,634 (52 percent) to 59,182 (47.6 percent). 
In his 1974 defeat, Mizell polled less than three fifths of the total votes 
that he had received in 1972. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., a former House 
colleague, appointed Mizell as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic 
Development, a post he held from March 1975 to May 1976. In 1976, Mizell 
challenged Neal again and lost, 83,129 (45.6 percent) to 98,789 (54.2 percent). 
Neal, a strong supporter of the Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter, 
polled almost the same raw vote as Mizell had four years earlier, when 
he was running on the Nixon--Agnew slate. In 1981, Mizell was appointed 
Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Governmental and Public Affairs 
in the Reagan administration. Later he was appointed as Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Intergovernmental Affairs, Department of Veterans Affairs, 
in the George H. W. Bush administration. Mizell also worked as executive 
director of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. After 
leaving government life, Mizell resided in Midway, North Carolina. He considered 
running for his old seat again in the 1990s, but decided against it. In 
the fall of 1998, Mizell had a heart attack while watching his son Dave 
coach High Point Andrews High School in a football game against North Davidson 
High School in Welcome. Just before kickoff, rescue crews were called, 
and the game was postponed for about a half hour. Mizell was taken to the 
cardiac care unit of Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. He 
recovered for a few months. Mizell died at the age of 68 in Kerrville, 
Texas, where he was visiting his wife's family. Mizell was survived by 
his two sons, Danny and Dave, who both live in North Carolina, and by four
