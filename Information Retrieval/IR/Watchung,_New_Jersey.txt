Watchung is a borough in Somerset County, New Jersey, United States. As 
of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 5,801,[9][10][11] 
reflecting an increase of 188 (+3.3%) from the 5,613 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 503 (+9.8%) from the 5,110 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[20] The name "Watchung" comes from the Lenni Lenape 
Native Americans, meaning "high hills"[21] or from "watschu", meaning "hill".[22] 
George Washington surveyed the British troops in Perth Amboy, many miles 
away, from the first ridge of the Watchung Mountains. The eastern edge 
of these ridges reaches to the Oranges in the direction of Newark. The 
name "Washingtonville" was used in early times, but was rejected as the 
name for the area by the United States Postal Service, which felt that 
the state already had too many places named Washington.[23][24] Watchung, 
in the 1900s was a semi-rural small community of about 3,200 people in 
comparison with the relatively larger and more urban communities of Plainfield 
and Somerville. The first mayor of the town was Henry Baldwin Macdonald, 
who served from 1926 to 1928. Even as late as the 1960s, it was common 
for residents to know one another by name, with few moving in or out of 
the town. The 1967 Plainfield riots, however, caused an exodus of the large 
upper-middle class population from the nearby cities to the Watchung Hills 
area to communities such as Watchung, Warren Township and Bridgewater Township.[citation

Legislature on May 23, 1926, from portions of North Plainfield Township 
(now Green Brook Township) based on the results of a referendum held on 
April 20, 1926.[25][26] In the wake of public fear that ensued after the 
1938 radio broadcast of Orson Welles' The War of the Worlds, National Guard 
troops were stationed around the hills in Watchung, as told on the vinyl 
record recording of news reports of the day.[citation needed] Notable figures 
who have lived in Watchung include Bobby Thomson, Billy Ard and Carl Banks. 
Eaton House is a Watchung historic site that was owned by congressman Charles 
Aubrey Eaton and has been the residence of other notables over the years. 
Known also as the Sunbright Farm farmhouse, the home was damaged in April 
2014 when it was hit by trees that fell as a result of a likely microburst 
in a severe storm that rolled through the area.[27] According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 6.054 square miles 
(15.679 km2), including 6.026 square miles (15.607 km2) of land and 0.028

municipal government. The governing body consists of a Mayor and a Borough 
Council comprising six council members, with all positions elected at-large 
on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A Mayor is 
elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough 
Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a 
staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year 
cycle.[7] The Borough form of government used by Watchung, the most common 
system used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government 
in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding 
at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances 
subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The 
mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and 
most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of 
the council.[37][38] As of 2016[update], the Mayor of Watchung Borough 
is Republican Stephen K. Pote, whose term of office ends December 31, 2018.
