Maria Pepe (born 1960) is best known for being one of the first girls to 
play Little League baseball. In 1972, at age 12, she pitched three Little 
League games for a Young Democrats team in Hoboken, New Jersey.[1] This 
was the same team which her friends from the neighborhood had joined, so 
she joined as well, after having been invited to play by Little League 
coach Jim Farina.[2] Pepe was asked to leave the team after the Little 
League "threatened to revoke Hoboken's charter."[2] The refusal to allow 
Pepe to play attracted the attention of the National Organization for Women 
(NOW).[3] A court case began on Pepe's behalf, which was supported by NOW. 
Ultimately the New Jersey Superior Court decided that Little League must 
allow girls to try out.[4][1] As a result, the Little League organization 
began a program specifically for girls starting in 1974. Pepe became a 
minor celebrity and drew media attention to various women's causes at the 
time.[1][4] The New York Yankees made her an honorary "Yankee for a day".[4] 
In 2004 she lent her glove and hat to the Peter J. McGovern Little League 
Museum in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania.[3] On August 20, 2004 she was 
also honored by Little League Baseball by being asked to throw out the 
ceremonial first pitch at the 2004 Little League World Series in South 
Williamsport.[3] In 2005 she attended a ceremony for Little League perfect 
game pitcher Kathleen Brownell who was being honored at the National Baseball
