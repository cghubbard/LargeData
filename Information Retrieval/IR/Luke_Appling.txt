As player As Manager Lucius Benjamin "Luke" Appling (April 2, 1907 – January 
3, 1991), nicknamed "Old Aches and Pains" was an American shortstop in 
Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the Chicago White 
Sox (1930–50). He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1964. Born 
in North Carolina, Appling briefly attended Oglethorpe College. He was 
signed by the minor league Atlanta Crackers in 1930 and debuted with the 
Chicago White Sox later that year. He interrupted his career to serve in 
World War II in 1944 and 1945. He played for Chicago until 1950, then was 
a minor league manager and major league coach for many years. He served 
one stint as an interim major league manager in 1967. He died in Georgia 
in 1991. Appling was born in High Point, North Carolina. He attended Fulton 
High School and Oglethorpe College in Atlanta.[1] He later said that he 
had been lefthanded, a trait that he shared with his father, until he was 
in high school. At that point, he said that he became righthanded because 
he wanted to play shortstop.[2] Appling left Oglethorpe during his sophomore 
year when he was signed by the Southern League Atlanta Crackers in 1930. 
He was a good hitter in his first year, but committed 42 errors in 104 
games. The Chicago Cubs showed some interest at first, but decided not 
to sign him, and the White Sox ended up purchasing him from the Crackers 
for $20,000. Appling appeared in only six games for the White Sox in 1930. 
He hit for a .232 batting average in 96 games in 1931. In 1933 his average 
increased from .274 to .322 in his first of nine straight .300 seasons.[1] 
The White Sox lost more than 90 games in four of Appling's first five seasons 
with the team.[3] His best season was 1936, when he batted .388, knocked 
in 124 runs (his only 100-RBI season), scored 111 times, recorded 204 hits, 
and had a team-record 27-game hitting streak. His batting average was good 
for the first AL batting title won by a shortstop. It was the highest batting 
average recorded by a shortstop in the 20th century. He finished second 
in the AL Most Valuable Player voting and earned his first All-Star Game 
selection. He also turned a league-leading 119 double plays.[1] Appling 
hit .317 in 1937 as the White Sox finished in third place in the AL. Appling 
played in 81 games in 1938; he missed much of the season with a broken 
leg. In 1940, Appling hit .348 with a career-high 13 triples.[1] Although 
the team finished fourth, they came closer to a league championship than 
at any point in his career, eight games behind the league champions.[3] 
Appling won another batting title in 1943 with a .328 average and also 
led the league in OBP that year (.419).[1] Appling missed the 1944 season 
due to military service and returned in time to play only 18 games the 
next year. He hit .309 in 149 games in 1946. Though his seventh and final 
All-Star Game selection came in 1947 when he hit .306, Appling hit .314 
and .301 in 1948 and 1949, respectively.[1] Appling had remained a solid 
contributor into his forties, but White Sox ownership was dedicated to 
a youth movement and he retired after the 1950 season. Upon his retirement, 
Appling was the all-time leader for most games played and for double plays 
by a major league shortstop, and the all-time leader for putouts and assists 
by an American League shortstop. These records were later broken by Luis 
Aparicio, who also spent the majority of his career with the White Sox. 
He made 643 errors, and has the worst fielding percentage since 1910 of 
players with at least 1900 games, however his speed and range meant that 
his defence provided excellent positive value throughout his career. Appling 
was a good leadoff hitter who topped the .400 mark in OBP eight times (1935–37, 
1939–40, 1943, 1948–49) and drew over 100 walks three times (1935, 1939, 
1949), though he often batted third due to a lack of offensive talent on 
the White Sox. Appling was well known for his ability to foul off pitches, 
leading to the story that he once fouled off 10 pitches in a row on purpose 
when ownership refused to give some baseballs to autograph because they 
were too expensive; he was supposedly never refused a ball again. Appling 
was famous among his teammates for complaining about minor ailments such 
as a sore back, a weak shoulder, shin splints, or a sprained finger. While 
much of this complaining was probably for show, it earned him the nicknames 
"Old Aches and Pains" and "Libby", the latter after blues singer Libby 
Holman.[4] "His constant stream of complaints might have become intolerable 
to his teammates if Appling had not developed a novel remedy," wrote Robert 
McG. Thomas Jr. of The New York Times. "He simply took his misery out on 
opposing pitchers, rapping out 2,749 hits, all but 587 of them singles."[5] 
Appling was a successful minor league manager after his playing days were 
over, winning pennants with Memphis in the Southern Association and Indianapolis 
of the American Association and being named minor league manager of the 
year in 1952; but his only chance to manage at the major league level was 
as a late-season replacement for Alvin Dark as manager of the Kansas City 
Athletics in 1967, leaving his major league managerial record at 10-30. 
He was a major league coach for the Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, 
Baltimore Orioles, Athletics and White Sox during the 1960s and early 1970s.[6] 
Though Appling had received only two Baseball Hall of Fame votes when he 
appeared on the ballot in 1953, he was elected in 1964. No candidate had 
received enough votes for induction based on the initial 1964 election, 
but Appling was named on the most ballots and he defeated Red Ruffing in 
a subsequent runoff vote.[7] In 1970, the Chicago chapter of the Baseball 
Writers' Association of America named Appling the greatest player in the 
history of the White Sox.[6] In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig 
included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. 
On July 19, 1982, Appling played in an old-timers' game at RFK Stadium 
in Washington, D.C. Then 75 years old, he hit a home run off Warren Spahn.[6] 
In 1989, The New York Times profiled the 82-year-old Appling, who had been 
a spring training coach for the Atlanta Braves for 14 years and was also 
serving as a minor league coach during the season.[8] On January 3, 1991, 
two days after retiring from the Atlanta coaching staff, Appling was in 
a hospital in Cumming, Georgia, suffering from an abdominal aortic aneurysm. 
He died during emergency surgery.[5] Pitcher Eddie Lopat remembered Appling, 
saying, "I played with him and against him, and he was the finest shortstop 
I ever saw. In the field, he covered more ground than anyone in the league. 
As a hitting shortstop, there was no one in his class."[6] In 1999, he 
was named as a finalist to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.
