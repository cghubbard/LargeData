The New York Gorhams were a Negro league baseball team that played from 
1886 to 1892. During their short existence the Gorhams grew to be one of 
the most successful black professional clubs in the country and challenged 
the supremacy of the Cuban Giants. Founded by Ambrose Davis as a barnstorming 
club that ranged from Newburgh, New York, to Easton, Pennsylvania, in 1887 
the Gorhams became founding members of the short-lived National Colored

of organized minor leagues, playing in the Middle States League of 1889 
and representing Norwalk, Connecticut in the 1891 Connecticut State League.[2] 
The 1891 Gorhams, managed by S. K. Govern, formerly of the Cuban Giants, 
were often billed as the "Big Gorhams," and featured two future Hall of 
Famers, Sol White and Frank Grant. White later wrote that he considered 
the Big Gorhams "without a doubt one of the strongest teams ever gotten 
together, white or black."[3] White continued: "Their ages ranging from 
22 to 32; every man placed where he was strongest, pitchers and catchers

Cape May white semipro team at Cape May, New Jersey, while President Benjamin 
Harrison looked onâ€”the only sitting President of the United States to witness
