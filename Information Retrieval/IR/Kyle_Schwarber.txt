Kyle Joseph Schwarber (born March 5, 1993) is an American professional 
baseball left fielder and catcher for the Chicago Cubs of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He played college baseball for the Indiana Hoosiers. He 
was drafted by the Cubs in the first round of the 2014 MLB draft, and made 
his MLB debut during the 2015 season. Schwarber attended Middletown High 
School in Middletown, Ohio. During his four years, he hit .408 with 18 
home runs and 103 runs batted in (RBIs).[1] As a freshman at Indiana University, 
Schwarber was named a freshman All-American by Louisville Slugger and Collegiate 
Baseball Newspaper after hitting .300/.390/.513 with eight home runs and 
47 runs batted in. As a sophomore in 2013, he hit .366/.456/.647 with 18 
home runs and 54 RBI in 61 games.[2][3] He was named a first-team All-American 
by the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association (NCBWA)[4][5] After 
the season, Schwarber played for the United States collegiate national 
team during the summer.[6][7] As a junior, he batted .348/.456/.643 with 
13 home runs. He was a finalist for the Johnny Bench Award.[8] Schwarber 
was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the first round, fourth overall, in 
the 2014 Major League Baseball draft.[9] He signed on June 11.[10] Upon 
being drafted, MLB.com analyst Bernie Pleskoff profiled Schwarber as a 
"game-changing" power-hitter. However, Pleskoff was critical of his base-running 
and fielding skills, commenting "Schwarber is sluggish on the bases and 
slow defensively".[11] ESPN's Keith Law echoed a similar sentiment in his 
draft profile, noting "Schwarber might have the most raw power of any prospect 
in the class."[12] Two pre-draft scouting reports by the MLB Scouting Bureau 
compared Schwarber's swinging mechanics to those of Jeff Bagwell, while 
also projecting him to play a role similar to Matt Stairs.[13] He made 
his professional debut with the Boise Hawks three days later, going 3-4 
with a home run and three RBIs.[14] The Cubs then promoted him to the Kane 
County Cougars of the Class A Midwest League and the Daytona Cubs of the 
Class A-Advanced Florida State League before the end of the season. Schwarber 
began the 2015 season with the Double-A Tennessee Smokies of the Southern 
League. In July 2015, he played in the All-Star Futures Game, where he 
was named the MVP of the game after hitting a go-ahead two-run triple for 
Team USA.[15] The Cubs promoted Schwarber to the major leagues on June 
16, 2015, to serve as a designated hitter for six games during interleague 
play.[16] Schwarber made his major league debut as a position player that 
night, replacing ejected starting catcher Miguel Montero in the eighth 
inning against the Cleveland Indians.[17] The following night, as a designated 
hitter, he got four hits in five at bats with two RBIs and six total bases. 
The Cubs sent Schwarber to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs of the Pacific Coast 
League after the six games.[18] On July 16, 2015, Schwarber was recalled 
from Triple A Iowa, to rejoin the Cubs due to an injury to catcher Montero.[19] 
On July 21, in a 5–4 extra-inning victory over the Cincinnati Reds, Schwarber 
hit a game-tying 2-run homer in the ninth inning and a solo go-ahead home 
run in the top of the 13th to give the Cubs the lead. Schwarber's three 
multihomer games are the most for a Cub rookie in his first 51 games played 
since 1914.[20] Over the course of the season he split time between catcher 
and outfield positions. He finished the 2015 regular season having played 
69 games, recording a .246 batting average with 16 home runs, 52 runs scored, 
and 43 RBIs.[21] In the National League Wild Card Game, Schwarber drove 
in three runs and hit a long two-run home run to help the Cubs defeat the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, 4–0, and advance to the Division Series against the 
St. Louis Cardinals.[22] In the NLDS, Schwarber helped the Cubs to a 3-1 
series victory with 2 home runs, including a mammoth game 4 shot that landed 
on top of the new Wrigley Field scoreboard in right field.[23] The ball 
was removed during the 2015-16 off season to prevent theft but was encased 
in Plexiglas and returned "to where it landed".[24] In his eighth career 
postseason game, a 5-2 loss to the New York Mets in game 3 of the 2015 
National League Championship Series (NLCS), Schwarber set a Cubs record 
with his fifth career postseason home run and also the record for the most 
home runs in a single postseason by a player age 22 or younger, passing 
Miguel Cabrera.[25] Schwarber only played two games before he was involved 
in an outfield collision with teammate Dexter Fowler on April 7, 2016, 
and was removed from the game with a left leg injury. Schwarber tore the 
anterior cruciate ligament and lateral collateral ligament in his left 
knee, and would miss the rest of the 2016 season.[26] Despite being injured, 
there were many trade rumors surrounding Schwarber during the season, especially 
regarding the Cubs desire for a premium reliever.[27][28] Club president 
Theo Epstein addressed Schwarber's situation by saying it "wouldn't be 
right to trade him".[29] The Cubs eventually acquired closer Aroldis Chapman 
from the New York Yankees without having to give up Schwarber.[30] As the 
Cubs advanced further into the postseason, an unexpectedly fast recovery 
made the return of Schwarber increasingly more of a possibility. Schwarber 
participated in a successful on-field workout with the team at Dodger Stadium 
before Game 3 of the 2016 NLCS.[31] On October 22, Schwarber went to the 
Arizona Fall League to play with the Mesa Solar Sox, the same day the Cubs 
played in Game 6 of the NLCS.[32] The Cubs added Schwarber to their roster 
for the 2016 World Series, and started him in Game 1 as their designated 
hitter.[33] Schwarber's addition to the Cubs' starting line-up was surprising 
given he had not played in a Major League game since his injury in April.[34] 
Schwarber hit a double off the right-field wall in the 4th inning of Game 
1. He became the first major league position player in baseball history 
to get his first hit of the season during the World Series.[35] He was 
not medically cleared to play on defense, and only made appearances as 
a pinch or designated hitter.[36] Schwarber and the Cubs defeated the Indians 
in seven games to claim the Cubs' first World Series championship in 108 
years.[37] During the World Series, Schwarber recorded seven hits, including 
one double, two RBIs, and one stolen base while batting for .412 and maintaining 
a .500 on-base percentage.[38] Kyle is the son of Greg, a retired police 
chief, and Donna Schwarber.[39] He has three sisters.[39] Kyle's uncle 
Thomas Schwarber played college baseball as a pitcher at Ohio State and 
played professionally in the Detroit Tigers minor league system for three
