Russell "Russ" Henry Snyder (born June 22, 1934) is a former Major League 
Baseball player, who played as an outfielder for the Kansas City Athletics 
(1959–60), Baltimore Orioles (1961–67), Chicago White Sox (1968), Cleveland 
Indians (1968–69) and Milwaukee Brewers (1970).[1] He helped the Orioles 
win the 1966 World Series. In a 2013 retrospective on Snyder's time with 
the Orioles, the Baltimore Sun called him the "unsung hero of the '66 Series" 
and "a sharp-fielding outfielder ... whose glove served the team down the 
stretch" of the 1966 American League pennant race.[2] In the September 22nd 
game that year versus the Athletics, Snyder made a diving catch to end 
the game and clinch the pennant for the Orioles.[2] Then, in the World 
Series opening game, "he saved two Dodgers runs with a dramatic lunging 
catch of John Roseboro's sinking liner" in centerfield, the Sun said.[2] 
He finished 3rd in voting for 1959 American League Rookie of the Year for 
playing in 73 Games and having 243 At Bats, 41 Runs, 76 Hits, 13 Doubles, 
2 Triples, 3 Home Runs, 21 RBI, 6 Stolen Bases, 19 Walks, .313 Batting 
Average, .367 On-base percentage, .420 Slugging Percentage, 102 Total Bases 
and 3 Sacrifice Hits.[1] In 1962, Snyder's .305 batting average led the 
Orioles that year and in 1966, his .347 batting average at the All-Star 
break led the American League.[2] Overall, in 12 seasons he played in 1,365 
Games and had 3,631 At Bats, 488 Runs, 984 Hits, 150 Doubles, 29 Triples, 
42 Home Runs, 319 RBI, 58 Stolen Bases, 294 Walks, .271 Batting Average, 
.325 On-base percentage, .363 Slugging Percentage, 1,318 Total Bases, 57 
Sacrifice Hits, 23 Sacrifice Flies and 10 Intentional Walks.[1] Following 
his retirement from baseball, Snyder worked in soil conservation. He and 
his wife Ann (who died in 2002 after 47 years of marriage) had three children.
