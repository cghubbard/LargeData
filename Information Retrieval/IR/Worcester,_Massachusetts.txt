Worcester (/ˈwʊstər/ WUUSS-tər, locally also i/ˈwᵻstə/ WISS-tə)[1] is a 
city and the historic county seat of Worcester County, Massachusetts, United 
States until most of Massachusetts disbanded county government in 1998. 
Named after Worcester, England, as of the 2010 Census the city's population 
was 181,045,[2] making it the second largest city in New England after 
Boston.[3] Worcester is located approximately 40 miles (64 km) west of 
Boston, 50 miles (80 km) east of Springfield and 40 miles (64 km) north 
of Providence. Due to its location in Central Massachusetts, amidst Massachusetts' 
major metropolitan regions, Worcester is known as the "Heart of the Commonwealth", 
thus, a heart is the official symbol of the city. However, the heart symbol 
may also have its provenance in lore that Valentine's Day cards were invented 
in the city.[4] Worcester was considered its own region for centuries; 
however, with the encroachment of Boston's suburbs in the 1970s after the 
construction of Interstate 495 and Interstate 290, it now marks the western 
periphery of the Boston-Worcester-Providence (MA-RI-NH) U.S. Census Combined 
Statistical Area (CSA), or Greater Boston. The city features many examples 
of Victorian-era mill architecture. The area was first inhabited by members 
of the Nipmuc tribe. The native people called the region Quinsigamond and 
built a settlement on Pakachoag Hill in Auburn.[5] In 1673 English settlers 
John Eliot and Daniel Gookin led an expedition to Quinsigamond to establish 
a new Christian Indian "praying town" and identify a new location for an 
English settlement. On July 13, 1674, Gookin obtained a deed to eight square 
miles of land in Quinsigamond from the Nipmuc people and English traders 
and settlers began to inhabit the region.[6] In 1675, King Philip's War 
broke out throughout New England with the Nipmuc Indians coming to the 
aid of Indian leader King Philip. The English settlers completely abandoned 
the Quinsigamond area and the empty buildings were burned by the Indian 
forces. The town was again abandoned during Queen Anne's War in 1702.[6] 
Finally in 1713, Worcester was permanently resettled for a third time by 
Jonas Rice.[7] Named after the city of Worcester, England, the town was 
incorporated on June 14, 1722.[8] On April 2, 1731, Worcester was chosen 
as the county seat of the newly founded Worcester County government. Between 
1755 and 1758, future U.S. president John Adams worked as a schoolteacher 
and studied law in Worcester. In the 1770s, Worcester became a center of 
American revolutionary activity. British General Thomas Gage was given 
information of patriot ammunition stockpiled in Worcester in 1775. Also 
in 1775, Massachusetts Spy publisher Isaiah Thomas moved his radical newspaper 
out of British occupied Boston to Worcester. Thomas would continuously 
publish his paper throughout the American Revolutionary War. On July 14, 
1776, Thomas performed the first public reading in Massachusetts of the 
Declaration of Independence in front of the Worcester town hall. He would 
later go on to form the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester in 1812.[10] 
During the turn of the 19th century Worcester's economy moved into manufacturing. 
Factories producing textiles, shoes and clothing opened along the nearby 
Blackstone River. However, the manufacturing industry in Worcester would 
not begin to thrive until the opening of the Blackstone Canal in 1828 and 
the opening of the Worcester and Boston Railroad in 1835. The city transformed 
into a transportation hub and the manufacturing industry flourished.[11] 
Worcester was officially chartered as a city on February 29, 1848.[8] The 
city's industries soon attracted immigrants of primarily Irish, French, 
and Swedish descent in the mid-19th century and later many immigrants of 
Lithuanian, Polish, Italian, Greek, Turkish and Armenian descent.[12] Immigrants 
moved into new triple-decker houses which lined hundreds of Worcester's 
expanding streets and neighborhoods.[13] In 1831 Ichabod Washburn opened 
the Washburn & Moen Company. The company would become the largest wire 
manufacturing in the country and Washburn became one of the leading industrial 
and philanthropic figures in the city.[12][14] Worcester would become a 
center of machinery, wire products and power looms and boasted large manufacturers, 
Washburn & Moen, Wyman-Gordon Company, American Steel & Wire, Morgan Construction 
and the Norton Company. In 1908 the Royal Worcester Corset Factory was 
the largest employer of women in the United States.[15] Worcester would 
also claim many inventions and firsts. New England Candlepin bowling was 
invented in Worcester by Justin White in 1879. Esther Howland began the 
first line of Valentine's Day cards from her Worcester home in 1847. Loring 
Coes invented the first monkey wrench and Russell Hawes created the first 
envelope folding machine.[16] On June 12, 1880, Lee Richmond pitched the 
first perfect game in Major league baseball history for the Worcester Ruby 
Legs at the Worcester Agricultural Fairgrounds.[16] On June 9, 1953 a F4 
tornado touched down in Petersham, Massachusetts northwest of Worcester. 
The tornado tore through 48 miles of Worcester County including a large 
area of the city of Worcester. The tornado left massive destruction and 
killed 94 people. The Worcester Tornado would be the most deadly tornado 
to ever hit Massachusetts.[17] Debris from the tornado landed as far away 
as Dedham, Massachusetts.[18] After World War II, Worcester began to fall 
into decline as the city lost its manufacturing base to cheaper alternatives 
across the country and overseas. Worcester felt the national trends of 
movement away from historic urban centers. The city's population would 
drop over 20% from 1950 to 1980. In the mid-20th century large urban renewal 
projects were undertaken to try and reverse the city's decline. A huge 
area of downtown Worcester was demolished for new office towers and the 
1,000,000 sq. ft. Worcester Center Galleria shopping mall.[19] After only 
30 years the Galleria would lose most of its major tenants and lose its 
appeal to more suburban shopping malls around Worcester County. In the 
1960s, Interstate 290 was built right through the center of Worcester, 
permanently dividing the city. In 1963, Worcester native Harvey Ball introduced 
the iconic yellow smiley face to American culture.[20][21] In the late 
20th century Worcester's economy began to recover as the city expanded 
into biotechnology and healthcare fields.[22] The UMass Medical School 
has become a leader in biomedical research and the Massachusetts Biotechnology 
Research Park has become a center of medical research and development.[22] 
Worcester hospitals Saint Vincent Hospital and UMass Memorial Health Care 
have become two of the largest employers in the city. Worcester's many 
colleges, including the College of the Holy Cross, Worcester Polytechnic 
Institute, Clark University, UMass Medical School, Assumption College, 
MCPHS University, Becker College, and Worcester State University, attract 
many students to the area and help drive the new economy. On December 3, 
1999 a homeless man and his girlfriend accidentally started a five-alarm 
fire at the Worcester Cold Storage & Warehouse Company. The fire took the 
lives of six firemen and drew national attention as one of the worst firefighting 
tragedies in the late 20th century.[23] President Bill Clinton, Vice President 
Al Gore and other local and national dignitaries attended the funeral service 
and memorial program in Worcester.[23] In recent decades, a renewed interest 
in the city's downtown has brought new investment and construction to Worcester. 
A Convention Center was built along the DCU Center arena in downtown Worcester 
in 1997.[24] In 2000, Worcester's Union Station reopened after 25 years 
of neglect and a $32 million renovation. Hanover Insurance helped fund 
a multimillion-dollar renovation to the old Franklin Square Theater into 
the Hanover Theatre for the Performing Arts.[25] In 2000, the Massachusetts 
College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences built a new campus in downtown 
Worcester.[26] In 2007 WPI opened the first facility in their new Gateway 
Park center in Lincoln Square.[27] In 2004, Berkeley Investments proposed 
demolishing the old Worcester Center Galleria for a new mixed-used development 
called City Square. The ambitious project looked to reconnect old street 
patterns while creating a new retail, commercial and living destination 
in the city.[28] After struggling to secure finances for a number of years 
Hanover Insurance took over the project and demolition began on September 
13, 2010. Unum Insurance and the Saint Vincent Hospital leased into the 
project and both facilities opened in 2013. The new Front Street opened 
on December 31, 2012.[29] Worcester has a total area 38.6 square miles 
(100 km2). 37.6 square miles (97 km2) of it is land and 1.0 square mile 
(2.6 km2) (roughly 2.59%) is water. Worcester is bordered by the towns 
of Auburn, Grafton, Holden, Leicester, Millbury, Paxton, Shrewsbury, and 
West Boylston. Worcester is known as the Heart of the Commonwealth, because 
of its proximity to the center of Massachusetts. The city is about 45 miles 
(72 km) west of Boston, 40 miles (64 km) east of Springfield, and 38 miles 
(61 km) northwest of Providence, Rhode Island. The Blackstone River forms 
in the center of Worcester by the confluence of the Middle River and Mill 
Brook. The river courses underground through the center of the city, and 
emerges at the foot of College Hill. It then flows south through Quinsigamond 
Village and into Millbury. Worcester is the beginning of the Blackstone 
Valley that frames the river. The Blackstone Canal was once an important 
waterway connecting Worcester to Providence and the Eastern Seaboard, but 
the canal fell into disuse at the end of the 19th century and was mostly 
covered up. In recent years, local organizations including the Canal District 
Business Association have proposed restoring the canal and creating a Blackstone 
Valley National Park.[30] Worcester is one of many cities claimed, like 
Rome, to be found on seven hills: Airport Hill, Bancroft Hill, Belmont 
Hill (Bell Hill), Grafton Hill, Green Hill, Pakachoag Hill and Vernon Hill. 
However, Worcester has more than seven hills including Indian Hill, Newton 
Hill, Poet's Hill, and Wigwam Hill. Worcester has many ponds and two prominent 
lakes: Indian Lake and Lake Quinsigamond. Lake Quinsigamond (also known 
as Long Pond) stretches four miles across the Worcester and Shrewsbury 
border and is a very popular competitive rowing and boating destination. 
Worcester's humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) is typical of New England. 
The weather changes rapidly owing to the confluence of warm, humid air 
from the southwest; cool, dry air from the north; and the moderating influence 
of the Atlantic Ocean to the east. Summers are typically warm and humid, 
while winters are cold, windy, and snowy. Snow typically falls from the 
second half of November into early April,[31] with occasional falls in 
October; May snow is much rarer. The USDA classifies the city as straddling 
hardiness zones 5b and 6a.[32] The hottest month is July, with a 24-hour 
average of 70.2 °F (21.2 °C), while the coldest is January, at 24.1 °F 
(−4.4 °C). There is an average of only 3.5 days of 90 °F (32 °C)+ highs 
and 4.1 nights of lows at or below 0 °F (−18 °C) per year, and periods 
of both extremes are rarely sustained. The all-time record high temperature 
is 102 °F (39 °C), recorded on July 4, 1911,[33] the only 100 °F (38 °C) 
or greater temperature to date. The all-time record low temperature is 
−24 °F (−31 °C), recorded on February 16, 1943.[34] The city averages 48.1 
inches (1,220 mm) of precipitation a year, as well as an average of 64.1 
inches (163 cm) of snowfall a season, receiving far more snow than coastal 
locations less than 40 miles (64 km) away. Massachusetts' geographic location, 
jutting out into the North Atlantic, makes the city very prone to Nor'easter 
weather systems that can dump heavy snow on the region. While rare, the 
city has had its share of extreme weather. On September 21, 1938, the city 
was hit by the brutal New England Hurricane of 1938. Fifteen years later, 
Worcester was hit by a tornado that killed 94 people. The deadliest tornado 
in New England history, it damaged a large part of the city and surrounding 
towns. It struck Assumption Preparatory School, now the site of Quinsigamond 
Community College. Worcester and the surrounding areas, looking north from 
3700 feet (1128 m). Route 146 can be seen under construction. Dodge Park

waves of immigrants have in the past formed coherent ethnic enclaves, some 
of which continue to contribute to the rich ethnic texture of Worcester 
today. Swedes settled in Quinsigamond Village and Greendale, Italians settled 
along Shrewsbury Street, Irish and Poles settled around Kelley Square, 
Lithuanians settled on Vernon Hill, and Jews built their first synagogues 
on Green Island and Union Hill. The African-American community has existed 
since colonial times. Since the late 19th century, Grafton Hill and Vernon 
Hill have been points of entry for immigrants from all over the world: 
Irish, Italians, Lithuanians, Poles, Syrians, Lebanese, Indians, Puerto 
Ricans, French Canadians, and more recently, Albanians and Brazilians. 
Other prominent groups include Congolese, Russians, Armenians, Vietnamese, 
Liberians, Ghanaians and Greeks. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Worcester 
had a population of 181,045, of which 88,150 (48.7%) were male and 92,895 
(51.3%) were female. In terms of age, 77.9% were over 18 years old and 
11.7% were over 65 years old; the median age is 33.4 years. The median 
age for males is 32.1 years and 34.7 years for females. In terms of race 
and ethnicity, Worcester's population was 69.4% White, 11.6% Black or African 
American, 0.4% American Indian and Alaska Native, 6.1% Asian (3.0% Vietnamese, 
0.9% Chinese, and 0.8% Asian Indian), <0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific 
Islander, 8.4% from Some Other Race, and 4.0% from Two or More Races (1.2% 
White and Black or African American; 1.0% White and Some Other Race). Hispanics 
and Latinos of any race made up 20.9% of the population (12.7% Puerto Rican).[39] 
Non-Hispanic Whites were 59.6% of the population in 2010,[40] down from 
96.8% in 1970.[41] Data is from the 2009-2013 American Community Survey 
5-Year Estimates.[42][43][44] Kate Campanale (R) Dan Donahue (D) John Mahoney 
(D) Mary Keefe (D) Worcester is governed by a Council-manager government 
with a popularly elected mayor. A city council acts as the legislative 
body, and the council-appointed manager handles the traditional day-to-day 
chief executive functions. City councilors can run as either a representative 
of a city district or as an at-large candidate. The winning at-large candidate 
who receives the greatest number of votes for mayor becomes the mayor (at-large 
councilor candidates must ask to be removed from the ballot for mayor if 
they do not want to be listed on the mayoral ballot). As a result, voters 
must vote for their mayoral candidate twice, once as an at-large councilor, 
and once as the mayor. The mayor has no more authority than other city 
councilors, but is the ceremonial head of the city and chair of the city 
council and school committee. Currently, there are 11 councilors: 6 at-large 
and 5 district. Worcester's first charter, which went into effect in 1848, 
established a Mayor/Bicameral form of government. Together, the two chambers 
— the 11-member Board of Aldermen and the 30-member Common Council — were 
vested with complete legislative powers. The mayor handled all administrative 
departments, though appointments to those departments had to be approved 
by the two-chamber City Council. Seeking to replace the 1848 charter, Worcester 
voters in November 1947 approved a change to Plan E municipal government. 
In effect from January 1949 until November 1985, this charter (as outlined 
in chapter 43 of the Massachusetts General Laws) established City Council/City 
Manager government. This type of governance, with modifications, has survived 
to the present day. Initially, Plan E government in Worcester was organized 
as a 9-member council (all at-large), a ceremonial mayor elected from the 
council by the councilors, and a council-appointed city manager. The manager 
oversees the daily administration of the city, makes all appointments to 
city offices, and can be removed at any time by a majority vote of the 
Council. The mayor chairs the city council and the school committee, and 
does not have the power to veto any vote.[45] In 1983, Worcester voters 
again decided to change the city charter. This "Home Rule" charter (named 
for the method of adoption of the charter) is similar to Plan E, the major 
changes being to the structure of the council and the election of the mayor. 
The 9-member Council became 11, 6 at-large and 1 from each city district. 
The mayor is chosen by popular election, but must also run and win as an 
at-large councilor. Worcester's history of social progressivism includes 
a number of temperance and abolitionist movements. It was a leader in the 
women's suffrage movement: The first national convention advocating women's 
rights was held in Worcester, October 23–24, 1850.[46] Two of the nation's 
most radical abolitionists, Abby Kelley Foster and her husband Stephen 
S. Foster, adopted Worcester as their home, as did Thomas Wentworth Higginson, 
the editor of The Atlantic Monthly and Emily Dickinson's avuncular correspondent, 
and Unitarian minister Rev. Edward Everett Hale. The area was already home 
to Lucy Stone, Eli Thayer, and Samuel May, Jr. They were joined in their 
political activities by networks of related Quaker families such as the 
Earles and the Chases, whose organizing efforts were crucial to the anti-slavery 
cause in central Massachusetts and throughout New England. Anarchist Emma 
Goldman and two others opened an ice cream shop in 1892. "It was spring 
and not yet warm," Goldman later wrote, "but the coffee I brewed, our sandwiches, 
and dainty dishes were beginning to be appreciated. Within a short time 
we were able to invest in a soda-water fountain and some lovely coloured 
dishes."[47] On October 19, 1924, the largest gathering of the Ku Klux 
Klan (KKK) ever held in New England took place at the Agricultural Fairgrounds 
in Worcester. Klansmen in sheets and hoods, new Knights awaiting a mass 
induction ceremony, and supporters swelled the crowd to 15,000. The KKK 
had hired more than 400 "husky guards", but when the rally ended around 
midnight, a riot broke out. Klansmen's cars were stoned and burned, and 
their windows smashed. KKK members were pulled from their cars and beaten. 
Klansmen called for police protection, but the situation raged out of control 
for most of the night. The violence after the "Klanvocation" had the desired 
effect: Membership fell off, and no further public Klan meetings were held 
in Worcester[citation needed]. Robert Stoddard, owner of The Telegram and 
Gazette, was one of the founders of the John Birch Society. Sixties era 
radical Abbie Hoffman was born in Worcester in 1936 and spent more than 
half of his life there. For public safety needs, the City of Worcester 
is protected by both the Worcester Fire Department and the Worcester Police 
Department. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are provided by UMass Memorial 
Medical Center under contract with the city. Originally operated by Worcester 
City Hospital and later by the University of Massachusetts Medical School, 
"Worcester EMS" operates exclusively at the advanced life support (ALS) 
level, with two paramedics staffing each ambulance. UMass Memorial EMS 
maintains two community EMS stations and operates a fleet of 18 ambulances, 
as well as a special-operations trailer, several other support vehicles, 
and a bike team. The agency responds to over 32,000 calls for medical assistance 
annually. UMass Memorial EMS operates the EMS Communications Center, which 
is a secondary PSAP and provides emergency medical dispatch (EMD) services 
to Worcester and other communities. By the mid-19th century Worcester was 
one of the largest manufacturing centers in New England. The city's large 
industries specialized in machinery, wire production, and power looms. 
And although manufacturing has largely declined, the city still maintains 
large manufactures, like Norton Abrasives, which was bought by Saint-Gobain 
in 1990, Morgan Construction and the David Clark Company. The David Clark 
Company pioneered aeronautical equipment including anti-gravity suits and 
noise attenuating headsets. Services, particularly education and healthcare 
make up a large portion of the city's economy. Worcester's many colleges 
and universities make higher education a considerable presence in the city's 
economy. Hanover Insurance was founded in 1852 and retains its headquarters 
in Worcester. Unum Insurance and Fallon Community Health Plan have offices 
in the city. Polar Beverages is the largest independent soft-drink bottler 
in the country and is located in Worcester. The biotechnology and technology 
industries have helped spur major expansions at both the University of 
Massachusetts Medical School and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The Massachusetts 
Biotechnology Research Park hosts many innovative companies including Advanced 
Cell Technology and Abbott Laboratories. The Worcester Foundation for Experimental 
Biology located in nearby Shrewsbury developed the oral contraceptive pill 
in 1951. Downtown Worcester used to boast major Boston retailers Filene's 
and Jordan Marsh as well Worcester's own department stores Barnard's and 
Denholm & McKay. Over time most retailers moved away from downtown and 
into the suburban Auburn Mall and Greendale Mall in North Worcester. In 
2010,[49] the median household income was $61,212. Median income for the 
family was $76,485. The per capita income was $29,316. About 7.7% of families 
and 10.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.1% 
of those under age 18 and 7.5% of those age 65 or over. In October 2013, 
Worcester was found to be the number five city for investing in a rental 
property.[50] According to the City's 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial 
Report,[51] the top ten employers in the city are: Worcester's public schools 
educate more than 23,000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade.[52] 
The system consists of 33 elementary schools, 4 middle schools, 7 high 
schools,[53] and 13 other learning centers such as magnet schools, alternative 
schools, and special education schools. The city's public school system 
also administers an adult education component called "Night Life", and 
operates a Public-access television cable TV station on channel 11. The 
Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science was founded in 1992 as a public 
secondary school located at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute. One notable 
charter school in the city is Abby Kelley Foster Charter Public School, 
which teaches kindergarten through 12th grade. It is granted status by 
Massachusetts as a Level 1 school. It is the one of 834 schools in the 
United States to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. 
Worcester Technical High School, or Worcester Tech.'s graduating class 
of 2014 was honored by having president Barack Obama as the speaker at 
their graduation ceremony. Their principal, Sheila Harrity, was awarded 
the national title of Principal of the Year by NASSP. Twenty-one private 
and parochial schools are also found throughout Worcester, including the 
city's oldest educational institution, Worcester Academy, founded in 1834, 
and Bancroft School, founded in 1900. The most known public schools include 
North High School, South High School, Doherty High School, Abby Kelley 
Foster, Worcester Technical High School and Burncoat High School. Worcester 
is home to several institutes of higher education. An early higher education 
institution, the Oread Institute, closed in 1934. Many of these institutions 
participate in the Colleges of Worcester Consortium. This independent, 
non-profit collegiate association includes academic institutions in Worcester 
and other communities in Worcester County, such as Anna Maria College in 
neighboring Paxton. It facilitates cooperation among the colleges and universities. 
One example of this being its inter-college shuttle bus and student cross 
registration. Worcester is the home of Dynamy, a "residential internship 
program" in the United States.[57] The organization was founded in 1969. 
Much of Worcester culture is synonymous with Boston and New England culture. 
The city's name is notoriously mispronounced by people unfamiliar with 
the city. As with the city in England, the first syllable of "cester" (castra) 
is left entirely unvoiced. Combined with a predominantly non-rhotic version 
of a New England accent, the name can be transcribed in General American 
as WOOS-tah or WISS-tah; see close central unrounded vowel.[59] Worcester 
has many traditionally ethnic neighborhoods, including Quinsigamond Village 
(Swedish), Shrewsbury Street (Italian) Kelley Square (Irish and Polish) 
Vernon Hill (Lithuanian) and Union Hill (Jewish). Shrewsbury Street is 
Worcester's traditional "Little Italy" neighborhood and today boasts many 
of the city's most popular restaurants and nightlife.[60] The Canal District 
was once an old eastern European neighborhood, but has been redeveloped 
into a very popular bar, restaurant and club scene.[61] Worcester is also 
famously the former home of the Worcester Lunch Car Company. The company 
began in 1906 and built many famous lunch car diners in New England. Worcester 
is home to many classic lunch car diners including Boulevard Diner, Corner 
Lunch, Chadwick Square Diner, and Miss Worcester Diner. There are also 
many dedicated community organizations and art associations located in 
the city. stART on the Street is an annual festival promoting local art. 
The Worcester Music Festival and New England Metal and Hardcore Festival 
are also held annually in Worcester. The Worcester County St. Patrick's 
Parade runs through Worcester and is one of the largest St. Patrick's Day 
celebrations in the state. The city also hosts the second oldest First 
Night celebration in the country each New Year's Eve. Worcester is also 
the state's largest center for the arts outside of Boston. Mechanics Hall, 
built in 1857, is one of the oldest concert halls in the country and is 
renowned for its pure acoustics.[62] In 2008 the old Poli Palace Theatre 
reopened as the Hanover Theatre for the Performing Arts.[63] The theatre 
brings many Broadway shows and nationally recognized performers to the 
city. Tuckerman Hall, designed by one of the country's earliest woman architects, 
Josephine Wright Chapman, is home to the Massachusetts Symphony Orchestra. 
The DCU Center arena and convention holds many large concerts, exhibitions 
and conventions in the city. The Worcester County Poetry Association sponsors 
readings by national and local poets in the city and the Worcester Center 
for Crafts provides craft education and skills to the community. Worcester 
is also home to the Worcester Youth Orchestras.[64] Founded in 1947 by 
Harry Levenson, it is the 3rd oldest youth orchestra in the country and 
regularly performs at Mechanics Hall. The nickname Wormtown is synonymous 
with the city's once large underground rock music scene. The nickname has 
now become used to refer to the city itself.[65][66][67] Worcester has 
1,200 acres of publicly owned property. Notable parks include Elm Park, 
which was laid out by Frederick Law Olmsted in 1854, and the City Common 
laid out in 1669. Both parks are listed on the National Register of Historic 
Places.[68] The largest park in the city is the 549 acre Green Hill Park. 
The park was donated by the Green family in 1903 and includes the Green 
Hill Park Shelter built in 1910. In 2002, the Massachusetts Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial was dedicated in Green Hill Park. Other Parks, include Newton 
Hill, East Park, Morgan Park, Shore Park, Crompton Park, Hadwen Park, Institute 
Park and University Park. As a former manufacturing center, Worcester has 
many historic 19th century buildings and on the National Register of Historic 
Places, including the old facilities of the Crompton Loom Works, Ashworth 
and Jones Factory and Worcester Corset Company Factory. The American Antiquarian 
Society has been located in Worcester since 1812. The national library 
and society has one of the largest collections of early American history 
in the world. The city's main museum is the Worcester Art Museum established 
in 1898. The museum is the second largest art museum in New England, behind 
the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.[69] From 1931 to 2013, Worcester was 
home to the Higgins Armory Museum, which was the sole museum dedicated 
to arms and armor in the country.[70] Its collection and endowment were 
transferred and integrated into the Worcester Art Museum, with the collection 
to be shown in a new gallery slated to open in 2015. The non-profit Veterans 
Inc. is headquartered at the southern tip of Grove Street in the historic 
Massachusetts National Guard Armory building. The Worcester Memorial Auditorium 
is one of the most prominent buildings in the city. Built as a World War 
I war memorial in 1933, the multipurpose auditorium has hosted many of 
the Worcester's most famous concerts and sporting events. Worcester was 
home to Marshall Walter ("Major") Taylor, an African American cyclist who 
won the world one-mile (1.6 km) track cycling championship in 1899. Taylor's 
legacy is being the second black world champion in any sport. Taylor was 
nicknamed the Worcester Whirlwind by the local papers. Lake Quinsigamond 
is home to the Eastern Sprints, a premier rowing event in the United States. 
Competitive rowing teams first came to Lake Quinsigamond in 1857. Finding 
the long, narrow lake ideal for such crew meets, avid rowers established 
boating clubs on the lake's shores, the first being the Quinsigamond Boating 
Club. More boating clubs and races followed, and soon many colleges (local, 
national, and international) held regattas, such as the Eastern Sprints, 
on the lake. Beginning in 1895, local high schools held crew races on the 
lake. In 1952, the lake played host to the National Olympic rowing trials. 
In 2002, the Jesse Burkett Little League all-stars team went all the way

US Census estimated that Worcester surpassed Providence in 2006 by 199 
people. Though this is well within the margin of error, List of United 
States cities by population uses the 2008 estimates for purposes of ranking. 
The New England article, however, ranks by 2000 Census, which places Providence 
as second largest. In the 2010 Census, Worcester's roughly 181,000 residents 
surpassed Providence's roughly 178,000. See also: Colleges of Worcester
