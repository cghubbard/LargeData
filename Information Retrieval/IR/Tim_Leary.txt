Timothy James Leary (born December 23, 1958) is a former Major League Baseball 
right-handed pitcher. Leary posted a 10-2 record in his senior year at 
Santa Monica High School, and was named to the 1976 All-CIF first-team. 
He went 19-1 to lead his American Legion Baseball team to the national 
championship.[1] Much more in stature than his teammate and fellow former 
major leaguer, Rod Allen, he received the opportunity to play college baseball 
at UCLA. He attended the University of California, Los Angeles, where he 
was a three-year letterwinner in baseball on top of completing an economics 
degree. Over his college career, Leary compiled a 21-15 record with a 3.09 
earned run average. His sixteen complete games is a school record, and 
his 258 strikeouts are the school's fourth highest total.[2] In 1978, he 
helped lead the USA Amateur Team to the silver medal in the World Cup played 
in Italy. He was also a member of the 1979 Pan Am Team.[3] Leary was selected 
by the New York Mets as the second overall pick of the 1979 Major League 
Baseball draft. He went 15-8 with a 2.76 ERA and 138 strikeouts for the 
Jackson Mets in his first professional season, prompting the Mets to make 
the controversial decision to bring him all the way to the majors for his 
second season. Making his major league debut on April 12, 1981, Leary faced 
just seven batters,[4] before leaving the game after just two innings with 
a strained elbow.[5] After four months inactive, he appeared in six games 
with the Mets' triple A affiliate, the Tidewater Tides toward the end of 
the 1981 season. He strained his elbow a second time during Spring training 
1982,[6] and was shut down for the entire 1982 season. He returned to Tidewater 
in 1983, and fell to 8-16 with a 4.38 ERA, mostly due to an increase in 
home runs allowed (11 versus just 5 in 1980). Regardless, he received a 
second call up to the majors that September, and never made it out of the 
second inning in his return, mostly due to two errors by George Foster 
in left field that led to five unearned runs.[7] His second start, however, 
went far better, as he pitched a complete game for his first major league 
victory against the Montreal Expos.[8] Leary split the 1984 season between 
Tidewater and the Mets before the Mets finally gave up on the pitcher once 
dubbed the "next Tom Seaver." During the off season, Leary was part of 
an unusual four team trade in which the Mets sent him to the Milwaukee 
Brewers and received Frank Wills from the Kansas City Royals. Leary spent 
the 1985 season with Milwaukee's triple A affiliate, the Vancouver Canadians, 
and once again returned to the majors when rosters expanded that September. 
He finally enjoyed his first healthy major league season in 1986 when he 
went 12-12 with a 4.21 ERA and 188.1 innings pitched. Following the season, 
he and Tim Crews were traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Greg Brock. 
After going 3-11 with a 4.76 ERA splitting his time between starts and 
as a reliever in 1987, Leary had a breakthrough season for the Dodgers 
in 1988. He held the Philadelphia Phillies to just one hit on May 25,[9] 
and was named the National League's "Pitcher of the Week" for the week 
of July 18â€“24, during which he shut out the St. Louis Cardinals[10] and 
earned a complete game victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.[11] He finished 
the season second on his team behind Cy Young Award winner Orel Hershiser 
in wins (17), ERA (2.91), shutouts (6), complete games (9) and innings 
pitched (228.2), while leading his club with 180 strikeouts. The Dodgers 
won the National League West by seven games over the Cincinnati Reds to 
face Leary's former franchise, the New York Mets, in the 1988 National 
League Championship Series. Leary appeared in the game four twelve inning 
marathon won by the Dodgers,[12] and made the start in game six, taking 
the loss.[13] In the World Series against the Oakland Athletics, Leary 
was used out of the bullpen by manager Tommy Lasorda. His three innings 
of scoreless work allowed the Dodgers to come back from a 4-2 deficit in 
game one,[14] and he appeared in game three, allowing one run in 3.2 innings.[15] 
Following the Dodgers' World Series victory, Leary was named the Sporting 
News' National League Comeback Player of the Year for his regular season 
performance. He was traded to the Cincinnati Reds midway through the 1989 
season with Mariano Duncan for Kal Daniels and Lenny Harris. After the 
season, the Reds sent him and Van Snider to the New York Yankees for Hal 
Morris and minor leaguer Rodney Imes. Leary experienced some hard luck 
in his first season with the Yankees. Despite a respectable 4.11 ERA, he 
led the American League with nineteen losses, mostly due to poor run support 
from the Yankees' bats and a league leading 23 wild pitches. Either way, 
the Yankees re-signed Leary for three years and $5.95 million when he became 
a free agent at the end of the season.[16] After winning his first two 
starts of the 1991 season, Leary went 2-8 with a 6.95 ERA to earn a demotion 
to the bullpen. He ended the season at 4-10 with a 6.49 ERA. He was moved 
back into the starting rotation in 1992, and was 5-6 with a 5.57 ERA when 
he was dealt to the Seattle Mariners for minor leaguer Sean Twitty. Seattle 
acquired Leary to fill a starting rotation that had been decimated by injury.[17] 
As a result, Leary made six starts that September. In 1993, the Mariners 
improved from a team that narrowly avoided one hundred losses to 82-80, 
mostly due to new manager Lou Piniella, and the emergence of young stars 
Randy Johnson, Ken Griffey, Jr. and Jay Buhner. For his part, Leary had 
his first winning season since 1988 at 11-9. Leary signed a minor league 
contract with an invitation to Spring training with the Montreal Expos 
in 1994. He was 2-4 with a 5.43 ERA for the triple A Ottawa Lynx when they 
released him. He caught on with the Texas Rangers shortly afterwards, and 
went 1-1 with an 8.14 ERA. He retired when the Rangers attempted to reassign 
him to the minor leagues following the season.[18] As of 2015, Leary is 
an Alumni member of the Los Angeles Dodgers Community Relations team. Leary 
was named the NL Silver Slugger pitcher in 1988, when he batted .269 with 
nine runs batted in and thirteen successful sacrifice bunts. His only career 
home run came off Hall of Famer Steve Carlton.[19] Leary was inducted into 
the UCLA Bruins Athletics Hall of Fame while he was a member of the New 
York Yankees. Shortly after his retirement, he became a coach for UCLA 
from 1997 to 2000 and again in 2004. He has also coached at Loyola Marymount 
University[20] Now he is the pitching coach for Brentwood School in Los 
Angeles. He resides in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles. He has two daughters,
