his third major-league starting appearance. He pitched 7⅓ innings against 
the Oakland A's until Damian Miller singled against him. In Milwaukee, 
Bush's next opportunity came against his former team, Toronto, on June

inning with a triple to end the bid. In an April 23, 2009 game against 
the Philadelphia Phillies, he once again took the no-hit bid 7⅓ innings
