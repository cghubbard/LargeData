Carlos Irwin Estévez (born September 3, 1965), known professionally as 
Charlie Sheen, is an American actor. Sheen rose to fame after a series 
of successful films such as Platoon (1986), Wall Street (1987), Young Guns 
(1988), Eight Men Out (1988), Major League (1989), Hot Shots! (1991), and 
The Three Musketeers (1993). In the 2000s, Sheen became best known for 
his television roles. He replaced Michael J. Fox in Spin City and his performance 
earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical 
or Comedy and then starred in Two and a Half Men which earned him several 
Golden Globe and Emmy Award nominations. He most recently starred in the 
FX comedy series Anger Management, which concluded its 100-episode run 
in 2014. In 2010, Sheen was the highest paid actor on television and earned 
US$1.8 million per episode of Two and a Half Men.[2] Sheen's personal life 
has made headlines, including reports of alcohol and drug abuse and marital 
problems, as well as allegations of domestic violence. His contract for 
Two and a Half Men was terminated by CBS and Warner Bros. in March 2011. 
Sheen subsequently went on tour.[3] On November 17, 2015, Sheen publicly 
revealed that he was HIV positive, having been diagnosed about four years 
earlier. Carlos Estévez was born on September 3, 1965, in New York City,[4][5] 
the youngest son of actor Martin Sheen (born Ramón Antonio Gerardo Estévez) 
and artist Janet Templeton.[6] His paternal grandparents were immigrants 
from Galicia (Spain) and Ireland, respectively.[7] His father is a "devout 
Catholic" and his mother is a "strict Southern Baptist".[8] Sheen has two 
older brothers, Emilio and Ramon, and a younger sister, Renée, all actors. 
His parents moved to Malibu, California, after Martin's Broadway turn in 
The Subject Was Roses. Sheen's first movie appearance was at age nine in 
his father's 1974 film The Execution of Private Slovik. Sheen attended 
Santa Monica High School in Santa Monica, California, along with Robert 
Downey, Jr., where he was a star pitcher and shortstop for the baseball 
team.[6][9] At Santa Monica High School, he showed an early interest in 
acting, making amateur Super 8 films with his brother Emilio and school 
friends Rob Lowe and Sean Penn under his birth name. A few weeks before 
graduation, Sheen was expelled from school for poor grades and attendance. 
Deciding to become an actor, he took the stage name Charlie Sheen. His 
father had adopted the surname Sheen in honor of the Catholic archbishop 
and theologian Fulton J. Sheen, while Charlie was an English form of his 
given name Carlos.[10][11] Sheen's film career began in 1984 with a role 
in the Cold War teen drama Red Dawn with Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, 
Lea Thompson, and Jennifer Grey. Sheen and Grey reunited in a small scene 
in Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). He also appeared in an episode of the 
anthology series Amazing Stories. Sheen had his first major role in the 
Vietnam War drama Platoon (1986). In 1987, he starred with his father in 
Wall Street. Both Wall Street and Platoon were directed by Oliver Stone. 
In 1988, Stone asked Sheen to star in his new film Born on the Fourth of 
July (1989), but later cast Tom Cruise instead. Sheen was never notified 
by Stone, and only found out when he heard the news from his brother Emilio. 
Sheen did not take a lead role in Stone's subsequent films,[12] although 
he did have a cameo role in Money Never Sleeps. In 1987, Sheen was cast 
to portray Ron in the unreleased Grizzly II: The Predator, the sequel to 
the 1976 low budget horror movie Grizzly. In 1988, he starred in the baseball 
film Eight Men Out as outfielder Happy Felsch. Also in 1988, he appeared 
opposite his brother Emilio in Young Guns and again in 1990 in Men at Work. 
In 1989, Sheen, John Fusco, Christopher Cain, Lou Diamond Phillips, Emilio 
Estévez and Kiefer Sutherland were honored with a Bronze Wrangler for their 
work on the film Young Guns.[13] In 1990, he starred alongside his father 
in Cadence as a rebellious inmate in a military stockade and with Clint 
Eastwood in the buddy cop film The Rookie.[6] The films were directed by 
Martin Sheen and Eastwood, respectively. In 1992, he featured in Beyond 
the Law with Linda Fiorentino and Michael Madsen. In 1994, Sheen was awarded 
a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[13] In 1997, Sheen wrote his first 
movie, Discovery Mars, a direct-to-video documentary revolving around the 
question, "Is There Life on Mars?". The next year, Sheen wrote, produced 
and starred in the action movie No Code of Conduct.[14] Sheen appeared 
in several comedy roles, including the Major League films, Money Talks, 
and the spoof Hot Shots! films. In 1999, Sheen appeared in a pilot for 
A&E Network, called Sugar Hill, which was not picked up. In 1999, Sheen 
played himself in Being John Malkovich. He also appeared in the third, 
fourth and fifth entries in the popular horror-spoof series Scary Movie. 
Sheen has also done voices for animation, appearing as Charlie in All Dogs 
Go To Heaven 2 (replacing Burt Reynolds), as well as Dex Dogtective in 
the Lionsgate animated comedy Foodfight.[14] In 2012, Sheen was cast to 
star alongside Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray in Roman Coppola's surreal 
comedy film A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III.[15] For the 
2013 film Machete Kills, in which Sheen played the President of the United 
States, he was credited under his birth name Carlos Estévez. It was a one-time 
move, due to the film's Hispanic theme; it was Sheen's idea to use his 
birth name for the film. The trailer and opening credits for the film used 
an "and introducing..." tag when showing Sheen's birth name.[16] Sheen's 
next feature film project will be the ensemble film Nine Eleven (2016), 
an adaptation of the 9/11 stage play Elevator written by Patrick Carson. 
The film will also feature Whoopi Goldberg, Gina Gershon, Luis Guzmán, 
Wood Harris, Jacqueline Bisset and Bruce Davison.[17] In 2000, Sheen debuted 
on the small screen when he replaced Michael J. Fox for the last two seasons 
of the sitcom Spin City (which also had fellow Ferris Bueller actor Alan 
Ruck as Stuart Bondek). For his work on Spin City, Sheen was nominated 
for two ALMA Awards and won his first Golden Globe for Best Performance 
by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy.[18][19] The series 
ended in 2002. In 2003, Sheen was cast as Charlie Harper in the CBS sitcom 
Two and a Half Men, which followed the popular Monday night time slot of 
Everybody Loves Raymond. Sheen's role on Two and a Half Men was loosely 
based on Sheen's bad boy image.[20] The role garnered him an ALMA Award 
and he gained three Emmy Award nominations and two Golden Globe award nominations.[18] 
During his eighth and final season on the show, Sheen earned $1.8 million 
per episode.[2] Production of Two and a Half Men went on hiatus in January 
2011 while Sheen underwent a substance rehabilitation program in his home, 
his third attempt at rehab in 12 months.[21][22][23] The following month, 
however, CBS canceled the season's four remaining episodes after Sheen 
publicly made derogatory comments about the series' creator, Chuck Lorre,[24] 
and Warner Bros. banned Sheen from entering its production lot.[25] Sheen, 
already the highest-paid actor on television,[2] responded by publicly 
demanding a 50 percent raise,[26] claiming that in comparison to the amount 
that the series was making, he was "underpaid".[26] CBS and Warner Bros. 
terminated Sheen's contract on March 7, 2011.[27] He was replaced by Ashton 
Kutcher.[28][29] In the aftermath of his dismissal, Sheen remained vocally 
critical of Chuck Lorre,[30] and filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against 
Lorre and Warner Bros., which was settled the following September 26.[31] 
That same month, Sheen, while presenting an award at the Primetime Emmy 
Awards, addressed "everybody here from Two and a Half Men" and stated, 
"From the bottom of my heart, I wish you nothing but the best for this 
upcoming season. We spent eight wonderful years together and I know you 
will continue to make great television."[32] In 2012, Sheen returned to 
television in Anger Management, the spin-off of the movie of the same name.[33] 
In the wake of the dismissal, Sheen had a highly publicized "meltdown" 
which was broadcast on television and the Internet. He made bizarre statements 
in television interviews, suggesting that he was a "warlock" with "tiger 
blood" and "Adonis DNA", and that he was "winning".[34] He also posted 
videos to YouTube showing himself smoking cigarettes through his nose, 
and cursing out his former employers.[35] He told one TV interviewer, "I'm 
tired of pretending I'm not special. I'm tired of pretending I'm not a 
total bitchin' rock star from Mars."[36] On September 19, 2011, Sheen was 
roasted on Comedy Central. It was watched by 6.4 million people, making 
it the highest rated roast on Comedy Central to date.[37] In 2006, Sheen 
launched a clothing line for children, called Sheen Kidz.[38] In 2011, 
Sheen set a Guinness World Record for Twitter as the "Fastest Time to Reach 
1 Million Followers" (adding an average of 129,000 new followers per day[39]) 
as well as the Guinness record for "Highest Paid TV Actor Per Episode – 
Current" at $1.25 million while he was a part of the cast of Two and a 
Half Men sitcom.[40] On March 3, 2011, Sheen signed with Ad.ly marketing 
agency specializing in Twitter and Facebook promotions.[41][42] On March 
10, 2011, Sheen announced a nationwide tour, "My Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat 
is Not An Option", which began in Detroit on April 2.[43] The tour sold 
out in 18 minutes, a Ticketmaster record.[44] However, on April 1, 2011 
the Detroit Free Press featured an article that stated as of March 30 that 
there were over 1000 tickets available from a third-party reseller, some 
at 15% less than the cheapest seats sold at the Fox Theater.[45] The Huffington 
Post reported that it was expected Sheen would earn $1 million in 2011 
from Twitter endorsements and $7 million from the North American tour.[46] 
Many of those attending the performance of April 2 in Detroit found it 
disappointing;[47] the subsequent performance in Chicago, which featured 
some adjustments, received a more positive reception.[48] Sheen was announced 
as the face of and partner in "NicoSheen", a line of disposable E-cigarettes 
and related products.[49] On August 13, 2011, Sheen hosted at the 12th 
annual Gathering of the Juggalos, an event created by the Insane Clown 
Posse. He received a mixed reaction from the audience,[50] but has expressed 
appreciation for the culture by describing himself as a Juggalo[51] and 
wearing a baseball cap featuring the Psychopathic Records logo in public 
and during production meetings for Anger Management.[52] Sheen has been 
married three times. He has five children and one grandchild. His first 
daughter, Cassandra Jade Estevez, was born on December 12, 1984, to his 
former high school girlfriend, Paula Profit,[53][54] whose name has also 
been given as Paula Speert.[55] Through Cassandra, Sheen has one granddaughter, 
Luna (born July 2013).[56] In January 1990, Sheen accidentally shot his 
fiancée, Kelly Preston, in the arm.[57] She broke off the engagement soon 
after.[58][59][60] In the 1990s, Sheen subsequently dated a number of adult 
film actresses, including Ginger Lynn[57][61][62] and Heather Hunter.[57] 
On September 3, 1995, Sheen married his first wife, Donna Peele.[63] That 
same year, Sheen was named as one of the clients of an escort agency operated 
by Heidi Fleiss.[64] Sheen and Peele divorced in 1996.[6] Sheen met actress 
Denise Richards on the set of Good Advice in 2000.[65] However, they did 
not begin dating until October 2001, when Richards guest-starred on Sheen's 
TV show Spin City.[65] They became engaged on December 26, 2001, and married 
on June 15, 2002, at the estate of Spin City creator Gary David Goldberg.[65] 
They have two daughters together, Sam J. Sheen (born March 9, 2004)[66] 
and Lola Rose Sheen (born June 1, 2005).[67] In March 2005, Richards filed 
for divorce, accusing Sheen of alcohol and drug abuse and threats of violence.[68] 
The divorce was finalized in November 2006 and preceded a custody dispute 
over their two daughters.[69][70][71] On May 30, 2008, Sheen married third 
wife Brooke Mueller.[72][73][74] They have twin sons, Bob and Max (born 
March 15, 2009).[75] In November 2010, Sheen filed for divorce. On March 
1, 2011, police removed Bob and Max from Sheen's home. Sheen told NBC's 
Today, "I stayed very calm and focused."[76] According to People, social 
services took the children after Mueller obtained a restraining order against 
Sheen. The document said, "I am very concerned that [Sheen] is currently 
insane."[77] Asked if he would fight for the children, Sheen texted People, 
"Born ready. Winning."[77] Sheen and Mueller's divorce became final on 
May 2, 2011.[1][78][79] On March 1, 2011, Sheen was concurrently living 
with pornographic actress Bree Olson and model and graphic designer Natalie 
Kenly, whom he collectively nicknamed his "goddesses".[80][81][82][83][84] 
Olson left Sheen in April 2011, and Kenly left in June 2011.[85][86] In 
a January 2013 interview on Piers Morgan Tonight, Sheen stated that he 
was in a relationship with adult film actress and 2011 Penthouse magazine 
Pet of the Month Georgia Jones.[87] Then in February 2014 Sheen became 
engaged to former adult film star Brett Rossi[88] who began going by her 
real name, Scottine Ross.[89][90] With a wedding planned for November 2014, 
the engagement was broken off in October with an announcement that the 
two had "mutually decided" to separate. Sheen stated, "I've decided that 
my children deserve my focus more than a relationship does right now. I 
still have a tremendous fondness for Scotty and I wish her all the best."[91] 
A month later it was reported that Rossi was hospitalized for an apparent 
drug overdose.[92] On May 20, 1998, Sheen suffered a stroke after overdosing 
while using cocaine and was hospitalized. Sheen was found in his seaside 
home by a friend, after which paramedics had to give emergency life-saving 
treatment and rushed him to Las Robles hospital. He was described as being 
in a "serious condition" after his stomach was pumped.[93] Sheen subsequently 
checked into a rehab clinic days later but told doctors within hours that 
he did not intend to stay. Sheriffs later forced Sheen back into the clinic 
after he fled only hours after arriving.[94] On August 11, 1998, Sheen, 
already on probation in California for a previous drug offense, had his 
probation extended for an extra year and entered a rehab clinic.[95][96] 
In a 2004 interview, Sheen admitted that the overdose was caused by his 
injecting of cocaine.[97] On December 25, 2009, Sheen was arrested for 
assaulting his wife, Brooke Mueller in Aspen, Colorado. He was released 
the same day from jail after posting an $8,500 bond.[98][99] Sheen was 
charged with felony menacing, as well as third-degree assault and criminal 
mischief.[100] On August 2, 2010, Sheen, represented by Yale Galanter,[101] 
pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault as part of a plea bargain that included 
dismissal of the other charges against him. Sheen was sentenced to 30 days 
in a drug rehab center, 30 days of probation, and 36 hours of anger management.[102] 
On October 26, 2010, the police removed Sheen from his suite at the Plaza 
Hotel after he reportedly caused $7,000 in damage.[103] According to the 
NYPD, Sheen admitted to drinking and using cocaine the night of the incident.[103] 
He was released after entering a hospital for observation.[104] On November 
17, 2015, Sheen publicly revealed that he was HIV positive, having been 
diagnosed roughly four years earlier.[105] In an interview, he referred 
to the phrase HIV as "three hard letters to absorb".[106] He manages his 
condition with a triple cocktail of antiretroviral drugs, and said that 
it was impossible that he could have infected any of his partners.[107] 
Sheen noted, that since 2011, he has paid extortionists approximately $10 
million to keep his HIV positive status secret.[107] A source indicates 
that Sheen had over 200 sexual partners after he learned he had HIV. Sheen 
stated that he was upfront about his HIV positive condition with all of 
his past consorts.[107] In an episode of The Dr. Oz Show taped in late 
2015 and aired January 12, 2016, Sheen stated "I'm [sic] been off my meds 
for about a week now," receiving alternative treatment in Mexico from Sam 
Chachoua, who claims to have an effective vaccine for HIV; according to 
his manager, however, after the episode was taped he resumed taking his 
medications.[108] In April 2016, Sheen reduced the monthly child support 
that he had to pay to his two ex-wives, Brooke and Denise, from $55,000 
to $10,000 after they demanded more child support money than he was currently 
paying.[109] The same month, it was announced that Sheen was under investigation 
by the LAPD stalking unit for threatening to kill his former fiancée Scottine 
Ross.[110] Sheen was the 2004 spokesperson for the Lee National Denim Day 
breast cancer fundraiser that raised millions of dollars for research and 
education regarding the disease. Sheen stated that a friend of his died 
from breast cancer, and he wanted to try to help find a cure for the disease.[111] 
A major donor and supporter of Aid For AIDS since 2006, Sheen was honored 
with an AFA Angel Award, one of only a few ever given, at the nonprofit's 
25th Silver Anniversary Reception in 2009.[112] In addition to his financial 
support, he has volunteered to act as a celebrity judge for several years 
for their annual fundraiser, Best In Drag Show,[113] which raises around 
a quarter of a million dollars[112] each year in Los Angeles for AIDS assistance.[114][115] 
He has brought other celebrities to support the event, including his father, 
actor Martin Sheen.[116] Sheen's interest in AIDS was first reported in 
1987 with his support of Ryan White, an Indiana teenager who became a national 
spokesperson for AIDS awareness after being infected with AIDS through 
a blood transfusion for his hemophilia.[117][118] On March 27, 2008, Sheen 
and Jenna Elfman co-hosted the Scientology-affiliated New York Rescue Workers 
Detoxification Project charity event.[119] Sheen donated one dollar from 
each ticket sold from his “My Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat is Not An 
Option Show” 2011 tour to the Red Cross Japanese earthquake Relief Fund.[44] 
In 2011, Sheen took on a Twitter challenge by a grieving mother to help 
critically ill babies born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia by supporting 
CHERUBS – The Association of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Research, 
Awareness and Support.[120] On July 16, 2012, Sheen announced that he would 
donate at least $1 million to the USO. This will be among the largest single 
donations ever given to the troop morale-boosting organization.[121] Sheen, 
a lifelong fan of the Cincinnati Reds, announced in August 2012 that he 
would donate $50,000 to the team's community fund, which supports various 
charities. The donation came after the team raised another $50,000 in an 
attempt to get broadcaster Marty Brennaman to shave his head on the field 
after a Reds victory. After Brennaman shaved his head, Sheen offered to 
match the previous donation total.[122] On March 20, 2006, Sheen stated 
that he questions the U.S. government's account of the September 11 attacks.[123] 
He said during the interview on The Alex Jones Show that the collapse of 
the World Trade Center towers looked like a controlled demolition.[124][125] 
Sheen has since become a prominent advocate of the 9/11 Truth movement.[126] 
On September 8, 2009, he appealed to President Barack Obama to set up a 
new investigation into the attacks. Presenting his views as a transcript 
of a fictional encounter with Obama, he was characterized by the press 
as believing the 9/11 Commission was a whitewash and that the administration 
of former President George W. Bush may have been responsible for the attacks.[127][128] 
Sheen is strongly opposed to vaccinations. After separating from Denise 
Richards he sent a legal notice to his daughters' physician stating his 
lack of consent to vaccinate them.[129] The dispute over vaccines seems 
to have played an important role in the failure of the marriage. Richards 
said in an interview in 2008, "When I vaccinated Sam, he accused me of 
poisoning her. And I knew when he said that that the marriage wasn't going
