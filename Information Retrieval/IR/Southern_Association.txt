The Southern Association was a higher-level minor league in American organized 
baseball from 1901 through 1961. For most of its existence, the Southern 
Association was two steps below the Major Leagues; it was graded Class 
A (1902–1935), Class A1 (1936–1945) and Class AA (1946–1961). Although 
the SA was known as the Southern League through 1919, today's Double-A 
Southern League is not descended from the Southern Association; the modern 
SL came into existence in 1964 as the successor to the original South Atlantic 
("Sally") League. A stable, eight-team loop, the Southern Association's 
member teams typically included the Atlanta Crackers, Birmingham Barons, 
Chattanooga Lookouts, Little Rock Travelers, Memphis Chicks, Nashville 
Vols, and New Orleans Pelicans. Either the Knoxville Smokies, Mobile Bears, 
or Shreveport Sports typically comprised the eighth club. After Jackie 
Robinson broke the color barrier in 1946 with the Montreal Royals of the 
International League, the Southern Association continued to adhere to the 
Jim Crow segregation laws of the time. Only one African-American ever played 
a meaningful game during this time--Nat Peeples of the 1954 Atlanta Crackers, 
the only black player in the league's history.[1] On April 9–10, 1954, 
Peeples played in two road games in Mobile, and went hitless in four at 
bats.[2] He was demoted to the already-integrated, Single-A Jacksonville 
Braves before the Crackers played a home game. The Southern Association 
then played the rest of its history, through the end of 1961, as a racially 
segregated league.[3] Partly due to this, its Major-League parent clubs 
were among the last to integrate during the 1950s, a period when African-Americans 
and Latin-American players of African descent were beginning to dominate 
Major League Baseball. By the end of the 1950s, the SA was the target of 
a boycott by civil rights leaders. In its last three years, the Southern 
Association was plagued by frequent franchise shifts. Little Rock moved 
to Shreveport after the 1958 season, and New Orleans moved to Little Rock 
after the 1959 season. Memphis' park burned down just before the 1960 season, 
forcing the Chicks to play in several temporary facilities before moving 
to Macon, Georgia for 1961. The league finally ceased operation after the 
1961 season. Member cities slowly began to join remaining leagues, which 
were racially integrated. The Atlanta club moved up to the AAA International 
League in 1962, with Little Rock following suit (as the renamed Arkansas 
Travelers) in 1963. Macon, a longtime member of the Sally League, returned 
to that circuit in 1962. After a one-year hiatus, Nashville and Chattanooga 
joined the Sally League in 1963, which became the Southern League in 1964. 
Birmingham and Mobile later joined the Southern League, and Memphis and 
Shreveport would enter the Texas League (and Arkansas/Little Rock would 
settle there), later during the 1960s. While a league pennant winner was 
crowned each season, some seasons (1928 and 1932–61) also concluded with 
either the top two or four teams in the league competing in playoffs to 
determine a league champion. These playoffs varied between being best-of-five 
and best-of-seven contests. The Atlanta Crackers, termed by some the "New 
York Yankees of the minors," won the Southern Association pennant 13 times, 
the most among all teams.[4] They are followed by the New Orleans Pelicans, 
with nine pennants.[4] As far as playoff championships are concerned, the 
Nashville Vols captured the most, with nine—dominating the league with 
six straight championships from 1939 to 1944.[5] They are followed by Atlanta, 
with six playoff titles.[5] Combining both pennants and playoffs, the Crackers 
won the most (21), with the Vols trailing them with 17. On the other hand, 
the Chattanooga Lookouts, charter members of the association, won only 
one title during their 54 years in the league—with that coming during the 
Southern Association's final, 1961 campaign.[4] The Southern Association 
gave a most valuable player award to the most outstanding player in the 
league from 1937 to 1957. In 1937, Coaker Triplett won the first ever Southern 
Association Most Valuable Player Award. Stan Palys won the final award
