The 2014 Minnesota Twins season was the 54th season for the franchise in 
Minnesota, and the 114th overall in the American League. They were the 
host team for the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. They finished 
last in the AL Central with a 70-92 record. On July 15, the 85th edition 
of the Mid-Summer Classic returned to the Twin Cities. Previous All-Star 
games were held at Metropolitan Stadium (1965) and the Hubert H. Humphrey 
Metrodome (1984). Twins Glen Perkins and Kurt Suzuki—in his first All-Star 
appearance—represented the hometown team. The battery-mates were called 
into action for the ninth, and closed down the National League All-Stars 
on nine pitches for a 5-3 AL win. Perkins, a two-time All-Star, earned 
the save.[1] On August 20, second baseman Brian Dozier joined the Twins 
'20/20' club, adding his name to the four others that have connected for 
twenty homers in the same season they've stolen twenty bases.[2] The small 
club includes Larry Hisle (1977), Kirby Puckett (1986), Marty Cordova (1995), 
Corey Koskie (2001) and Torii Hunter (twice, 2002 and 2004). The August 
24 game against Detroit was the longest Minnesota 9-inning game in history, 
in terms of time. The Sunday afternoon game at Target Field ran 4 hours 
and 10 minutes, and resulted in a 13-4 win for the Tigers.[3] In the first 
game of the September 13 doubleheader, starter Phil Hughes set a personal 
best in striking out eleven Chicago batters before being replaced in the 
eighth inning. (It had been 379 games since a Twin had posted double-digit 
strikeouts.) Michael Tonkin struck out another in the eighth. The three 
White Sox pitchers struck out 17 Twins, and the combined total of 29 strikeouts 
set a Minnesota record for a nine-inning game involving the Twins.[4] Phil 
Hughes' contract called for a $500,000 bonus if he reached 210 innings 
pitched. On September 24, he pitched 8 innings before an hour-long rain 
delay. Ron Gardenhire replaced him with a fresh pitcher when play resumed—and 
Hughes' inning tally halted at 209⅔. He declined to be inserted in a later 
game to achieve one more out.[5] At season's end, Phil Hughes' strikeout-to-walk 
ratio (186:16) measured at 11.63 to 1. That number is the best-ever in 
the major leagues, topping the previous best of 143:13 set by Bret Saberhagen 
in 1984. On September 29, Ron Gardenhire was fired. In his 13-year tenure 
as Twins manager he went 1068–1039, for a .507 winning percentage. The 
legacy he leaves includes the many memories of him being ejected from a 
game, enough times to rank in Major League's top ten (but far behind Bobby 
Cox's recorded 132 times). Native son Paul Molitor was hired on November 
3 to replace Gardenhire, becoming the Twins' thirteenth skipper. Molitor 
was born and raised in Saint Paul, attended the University of Minnesota 
and spent most of his career with the Milwaukee Brewers. He finished his 
playing career with three seasons in the 1990s as a Minnesota Twin, and 
coached and consulted in the organization since retiring. In 2004 he was 
voted into the Hall of Fame, so with his hiring he joins the only two other 
men who've been hired as first-time managers after being inducted in the 
Hall as players -- Ted Williams and Ryne Sandburg. Infielders Outfielders
