Troy Trevor Tulowitzki (born October 10, 1984), nicknamed "Tulo", is an 
American professional baseball shortstop for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major 
League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the Colorado Rockies. After 
a standout college baseball career for California State University, Long 
Beach, the Rockies selected Tulowitzki with the seventh overall selection 
of the 2005 MLB Draft. He made his MLB debut the following year. Tulowitzki 
is a five-time MLB All-Star, a two-time Gold Glove Award winner, and a 
two-time Silver Slugger Award winner. Tulowitzki's arm, range and instincts 
at shortstop are highly regarded. Furthermore, his size, ability and leadership 
skills have garnered him comparisons to Cal Ripken, Jr., Alex Rodriguez 
and Derek Jeter.[1][2] Tulowitzki graduated from Fremont High School in 
Sunnyvale, California.[3] He earned four varsity letters in baseball and 
two in basketball. He was twice named second team All-State in baseball, 
and was a 3-time team Most Valuable Player. As a junior, Tulowitzki had 
a batting average of .536. He also went 15–1 on the mound. As a senior, 
he batted .519 with 6 home runs. In basketball, Tulowitzki won league MVP, 
and was second team All-State and team MVP, averaging 22.6 points per game 
during his senior year. He was named Fremont High Athlete of the Year in 
2002.[3] A sure-handed starting shortstop for three seasons at California 
State University, Long Beach, Tulowitzki had a .962 career fielding percentage. 
Offensively, in 155 career games, he had a batting average of .310, with 
20 homers, 117 RBIs, 37 doubles, and a .491 slugging percentage.[4][5] 
He also accumulated 31 multi-hit games in his collegiate career. Baseball 
America rated him as having the top arm and as the best defensive shortstop 
in the Big West Conference. Tulowitzki was a two-time All-Big West selection 
(second team in 2003 and first team in 2004) and a two-time All-Regional 
Tournament selection, earning Most Outstanding Player (MOP) honors in 2004. 
In 2004 he was selected for the United States collegiate national team 
and helped lead Team USA to a gold medal in the World University Baseball 
Championship.[6] He was drafted by the Colorado Rockies, with the seventh 
overall pick in the first round of the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft.[7] 
Tulowitzki made his Major League Baseball debut with the Rockies on August 
30, 2006, against the New York Mets.[8] He had four at-bats and went hitless 
with three strikeouts. Tulowitzki made it to the big leagues after playing 
just 126 minor league games. He collected his first Major League hit, an 
infield single off Óliver Pérez of the Mets, on August 31.[9] Tulowitzki 
hit his first MLB home run on September 4, off Woody Williams of the San 
Diego Padres, in a 7–5 loss.[10] He posted a .240 batting average with 
one home run and six RBIs in 25 games during the 2006 season.[7] Tulowitzki 
entered spring training prior to the 2007 season in a battle with incumbent 
Rockies shortstop Clint Barmes for the starting role. After a spring that 
saw Tulowitzki win the spring training's MVP award, along with Barmes struggling 
offensively, Tulowitzki entered 2007 as the Rockies' starting shortstop.[11] 
As a rookie, Tulowitzki established himself in the eyes of some as a Gold 
Glove-caliber shortstop.[12][13][14] He led all MLB shortstops in fielding 
percentage (.987), putouts (262), total chances (834), assists (561), and 
double plays turned (114; 2 more than Jack Wilson, in 233 more innings). 
He also ranked first in range factor (5.39) and second in zone rating (.866). 
His target at first base, 3-time gold glover Todd Helton, led the National 
League in fielding percentage (.999; for the second straight year) and 
range factor (10.39). Tulowitzki's .987 fielding percentage set an MLB-single 
season record by a rookie shortstop.[15] He was also a major contributor 
in the Rockies' MLB-record .98925 fielding percentage for one season.[13] 
Tulowitzki ended up not winning the 2007 National League Gold Glove Award, 
which is voted on by NL coaches and players. The award went instead to 
Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins, despite the fact that Tulowitzki 
had a better fielding percentage (.987 to .985), zone rating, and range 
factor, and more total chances, putouts, and assists, and turned 4 more 
double plays, in 66.1 fewer innings, than Rollins. They each had 11 errors, 
but Tulowitzki's came on 834 total chances, compared to Rollins' 717.[16] 
Tulowitzki did, however, win the Fielding Bible Award at shortstop, which 
is awarded to the shortstop who a panel of voters view as the best defensive 
shortstop in Major League Baseball.[17] The panel consists of national 
sports writers, scouts and sports radio talk show hosts. On April 29, 2007, 
Tulowitzki turned just the 13th unassisted triple play in MLB history, 
during a 9–7 home victory at Coors Field over the Atlanta Braves.[18][19] 
As of 2009, eight of the 15 unassisted triple plays have been made by a 
shortstop. In the top of the seventh, Tulowitzki caught third baseman Chipper 
Jones' line drive with the runners moving, then stepped on second base 
to retire Kelly Johnson and tagged Edgar Rentería – who made no attempt 
to escape – before he could return to first base. Confused and not realizing 
what he had done, Tulowitzki went back and tagged second again, then threw 
the ball to Helton at first, neither of which was necessary. Instead of 
giving the historic triple play ball back to Tulowitzki, Helton accidentally 
tossed it into the crowd. However, the ball was eventually retrieved and 
returned to Tulowitzki a couple of weeks later.[20] Tulowitzki was named 
the NL Rookie of the Month for August.[21] On September 10, 2007, Tulowitzki 
hit his 20th home run of the season, which set the record for most home 
runs in a single season by a National League rookie shortstop.[22] The 
previous record was 19, held by Ernie Banks. Tulowitzki hit his first career 
grand slam on September 29, 2007, in an 11–1 home win over the Arizona 
Diamondbacks, off of Dustin Nippert.[11][23] He ended with 24 home runs 
on the season. In the 2007 season, Tulowitzki ranked first among NL rookies 
in at bats (609), plate appearances (678), games (155), hits (177), doubles 
(33), runs (104), total bases (292), walks (57) and RBIs (99; 2 ahead of 
Ryan Braun, in 158 more at bats than Braun). Tulowitzki's 99 RBIs led all 
National League shortstops (he was 3 short of a tie for the MLB lead, held 
by Detroit Tigers shortstop Carlos Guillén). His RBI total set an MLB-single 
season record for a rookie shortstop.[15] He finished second behind Braun 
in OBP (.359). He was third behind Braun and Hunter Pence in batting average 
(.291), slugging percentage (.479), OPS (.838) and triples (5). Tulowitzki 
was also third behind Braun and Chris Young in home runs (24) and extra 
base hits (62), and tied for ninth in stolen bases (7). Tulowitzki tied 
Young, Rajai Davis and Norris Hopper for the lead among all NL rookies 
in caught stealing (6), was second to Carlos Ruiz in grounding into double 
plays (14, which was one more – with 158 more at bats – than third place 
Braun) and second behind Young in strikeouts (130; leading all NL shortstops). 
However, Tulowitzki had the third lowest strikeout ratio (21.3%) out of 
all rookies with at least 400 at-bats, behind Kevin Kouzmanoff (19.4%) 
and Pence (20.8%). He batted .320 with a .554 slugging percentage and 15 
home runs at mile-high Coors Field, but hit only .256 with a .393 slugging 
percentage and 9 home runs in away games. However, it should be noted that 
one of the reasons for any substantial differences in home and road splits 
for Rockies batters is that they have to make adjustments in how they see 
pitches away from Coors Field – particularly breaking balls, such as sliders 
and curve balls – since those pitches act differently at Coors Field than 
on the road.[24] Team veterans alerted Tulowitzki every time Braun, his 
chief rival for rookie of the year honors, hit a home run.[25] Tulowitzki 
had a 10.8 WARP3 for the season (WARP3 is a metric that measures offensive 
and defensive production).[26] By comparison, Tulowitzki's rookie of the 
year rival, Braun, only had a 4.8 WARP3 rating.[27] Tulowitzki came in 
second in the race for National League Rookie of the Year. The award was 
voted on by 32 members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, 
two from each National League city. Braun beat Tulowitzki, 128 points to 
126 points, which was the closest voting in the NL since the current system 
was adopted in 1980.[28] Tulowitzki also lost to Braun in the vote for 
the 2007 NL Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award, which was voted on 
by 488 major league players and 30 managers.[29][30] Furthermore, he lost 
out to Braun in the competition for the 2007 Baseball America Rookie of 
the Year Award,[31] in the vote for the 2007 Players Choice NL Most Outstanding 
Rookie by their fellow major league players,[32] and in the Baseball Prospectus 
2007 Internet Baseball NL Rookie of the Year Award, with 487 first place 
votes, versus 666 for Braun.[33] However, on December 14, fans voted Tulowitzki 
the This Year in Baseball Rookie of the Year, with 27.6% of the vote, which 
was ahead of Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia (26.3%) and Braun 
(22.3%).[34] Tulowitzki was selected to the 2007 Topps Major League Rookie 
All-Star Team. The selection was the result of the 49th annual Topps balloting 
by Major League managers.[35] On October 1, 2007, in a one-game tie-breaker 
against the San Diego Padres, Tulowitzki went 4–7 with 3 extra-base hits 
and scored the tying run in the bottom of the 13th inning. The Rockies 
won the game, 9–8, and entered the playoffs as the NL wild card team.[36] 
They faced the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Division Series. 
On October 4, 2007, in the second game of the series, Tulowitzki and left 
fielder Matt Holliday hit back-to-back first-pitch homers in the first 
inning to begin a 10–5 win, and the Rockies headed to Denver with a 2–0 
lead in the series.[37] The Rockies went on to complete a three-game sweep 
of the Phillies, and advanced to the National League Championship Series, 
in which they swept the Arizona Diamondbacks in four games. Colorado then 
played the Boston Red Sox in the World Series, which was the first ever 
World Series appearance in Rockies history. Boston swept Colorado in four 
games. Tulowitzki batted .195 in the postseason, with a .267 on-base percentage 
and 15 strikeouts in 41 at-bats. Fox Sports writer Chadd Finn stated that 
while the World Series was the first time that he thought Tulowitzki looked 
like a rookie all season, he feels Tulowitzki will be better for the experience.[38] 
At the same time, MLB Hall of Fame shortstop and third baseman Cal Ripken, 
Jr. offered his own assessment of Tulowitzki: "He has a strong offensive 
game, but defensively, he's unbelievable. He really thinks about the position, 
all aspects of the game. I love that about him."[25] On January 23, 2008, 
Tulowitzki signed a six-year, $31-million contract extension with the Rockies.[39] 
The deal, which also included a club option for 2014, was the largest-ever 
contract for a player with less than two years experience until Ryan Braun 
signed an eight-year, $45-million contract extension with the Brewers on 
May 15, 2008.[40] On April 29, 2008, in a 3–2 road win over the San Francisco 
Giants, Tulowitzki tore a left quadriceps tendon during a defensive play 
in the first inning. He wasn't originally in the starting lineup for the 
game; however, he was put in at the last minute after utility player Jeff 
Baker broke a blood vessel in his throwing hand during pregame warmups.[41] 
On June 11, Tulowitzki played his first rehab game since the injury, as 
he started at shortstop in a minor league game for the Modesto Nuts – a 
high-A affiliate of the Colorado Rockies.[42] He returned to the Rockies, 
starting at shortstop, on June 20, in a 7–2 home loss against the New York 
Mets.[43] Tulowitzki went hitless in four at-bats and committed no fielding 
errors in the game. Colorado optioned second baseman Doug Bernier (who 
made his MLB debut with the team on June 17) to Triple-A before the game 
in order to open a roster spot for Tulowitzki. On July 5, 2008, Tulowitzki 
went back on the disabled list after cutting his right palm in the previous 
day's 18–17 home win over the Florida Marlins. The injury occurred in the 
bottom of the seventh inning when Tulowitzki slammed a maple bat into the 
ground in frustration. The incident took place after he was taken out of 
the game in that same inning; however, he noted that the frustration leading 
up to his injury wasn't due to being taken out, saying, "I was a little 
bit frustrated, not at the move. If anything, I thought it was the right 
move. I came in the hallway, grabbed a bat, hit it on the ground and the 
bat exploded in my hand and cut open my palm running up to my index finger."[44] 
The cut required 16 stitches, but no damage was done to any tendons or 
nerves. Tulowitzki returned to the Rockies lineup, starting at shortstop, 
on July 21, 2008, in a 16–10 home loss against the Los Angeles Dodgers.[45] 
He recorded a career-high five hits during the game, as he went 5-for-5 
with one RBI.[46] Also since returning from July 21 he has had 6 multi-hit 
games in his past 8 games (updated through July 29). During the season 
in games prior to July 21, Tulowitzki only had six multi-hit games (38 
games played, prior to July 21).[47] Tulowitzki ended the 2008 season with 
a .263 batting average, 8 home runs, and 46 RBI in 101 games.[7] On August 
10, 2009, Tulowitzki hit for the cycle as part of an 11–5 home win over 
the Chicago Cubs.[48] He also had a career-high seven RBI, which tied for 
the third-most RBI in MLB history in a game for a player who hit for the 
cycle. Tulowitzki became the fifth Rockies player to hit for the cycle. 
He also was the second player in MLB history to hit for the cycle and record 
an unassisted triple play in a career. Tulowitzki hit a career-high 32 
home runs during the season and had a .552 slugging percentage, both of 
which led all MLB shortstops. He was second in RBI (92), triples (9), walks 
(73) and on-base plus slugging percentage (.930).[49] He finished fifth 
in voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America for National 
League MVP.[50] On June 17, 2010, Tulowitzki fractured his wrist after 
being hit by a pitch from Minnesota Twins reliever Alex Burnett. He was 
placed on the disabled list the following day.[51] On July 4, 2010, Tulowitzki 
was one of two Rockies, along with starting pitcher Ubaldo Jiménez, selected 
as a National League All-Star to play in the 2010 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game at Angel Stadium of Anaheim. It was Tulowitzki's first All-Star 
appearance, but due to being on the disabled list since June 18 with a 
fractured wrist, he was replaced by New York Mets shortstop José Reyes.[52] 
In September, Tulowitzki hit 14 home runs from September 3 through the 
18th, garnering him back-to-back NL Player of the Week honors for September 
6–12 and 13–19.[53] He also earned his first National League Player of 
the Month award for his efforts during the month of September, in which 
he led all MLB players with 15 home runs, 40 RBI, 30 runs scored and an 
.800 slugging percentage.[54] Only Babe Ruth had just as many or more home 
runs (17) and RBI (43) during that month in MLB history.[55] Tulowitzki 
finished the 2010 season leading all MLB shortstops in home runs (27), 
RBI (95), batting average (.315), on-base percentage (.381), slugging percentage 
(.568) and on-base plus slugging percentage (.949).[7] He placed fifth 
in voting for National League MVP for the second consecutive season.[50][56] 
Tulowitzki picked up his first Silver Slugger Award for his offensive prowess.[55] 
On the defensive side, he had the best fielding percentage (.984) and range 
factor (5.06) among all shortstops in the National League. He earned his 
second Fielding Bible Award and first Gold Glove at shortstop.[57][58] 
He was also ESPN's 2010 Web Gem champion.[59] On November 29, 2010, Tulowitzki 
agreed to sign a six-year extension on top of the three years, with a fourth 
option year, remaining on his contract. The six-year extension was worth 
around $120 million, making it the second-largest contract ever signed 
by a Rockies player (behind Todd Helton's nine-year $141.5 million contract).[60] 
Tulowitzki's walk-up music to begin the season was Katy Perry's "Firework", 
which was chosen by fans in an online poll. However, he switched to Justin 
Bieber's "Baby" (another selection on the poll) after starting out in a 
0–8 slump. Tulowitzki was elected by his fellow players as a National League 
reserve for the 2011 All-Star Game in Phoenix, Arizona, but after an injury 
to starter José Reyes (who was chosen by fans), Tulowitzki became the NL's 
starting shortstop. He had one hit during the game, which was a single. 
Tulowitzki won his second consecutive (third overall) Fielding Bible Award, 
as the best fielding shortstop in MLB.[61] He also received his second 
consecutive Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Award.[62][63] On April 1, 2012, 
during a spring training game against the Cleveland Indians, Tulowitzki 
was hit by a pitch on the arm by former teammate Ubaldo Jiménez. Both Tulowitzki 
and Jiménez came close to each other while the benches cleared. Jiménez 
received a five-game suspension and an undisclosed fine. As the season 
progressed, Tulowitzki required surgery on his left groin that would leave 
him unavailable for all of the 2012 campaign. The injury happened on May 
30, during a doubleheader with the Houston Astros. It started to appear 
that Tulowitzki would be able to return before the season came to a close, 
but it would not be the case. The injury limited him to 47 games, in which 
he batted .287 with 8 home runs and 27 RBI.[7] On June 13, 2013, Tulowitzki 
suffered a fractured right rib in a 5–4 loss to the Nationals. He was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list and missed 25 games. Despite the injury, Tulowitzki 
was selected for the 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Teammates 
Carlos González and Michael Cuddyer were also selected, and all three players 
were in the starting lineup for the National League. Tulowitzki hit .312 
in 126 games in 2013, with 25 home runs and 82 RBI.[7] Tulowitzki started 
2014 by batting .364 in April with 7 home runs, 9 doubles, and 22 RBI. 
His hot start earned him the NL Player of the Month honors for April. On 
May 3, Tulowitzki singled for his 1,000th career hit in a game against 
the New York Mets. He injured his left hip during a July 20 game, and underwent 
labral repair surgery on August 15, which ended his season.[64] Tulowitzki 
finished the campaign with a .340 batting average in 91 games played. Despite 
his injury shortened season, he hit 21 home runs and 58 RBI.[7] Tulowitzki 
made his fifth All-Star team in 2015 as a replacement for the injured Dee 
Gordon.[65] He batted .300 with 12 home runs and 53 RBI in 87 game with 
the Rockies before being traded.[7] On July 28, 2015, Tulowitzki was traded 
along with teammate LaTroy Hawkins to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange 
for José Reyes, Jeff Hoffman, Miguel Castro, and Jesus Tinoco.[66] Upon 
being informed of the trade during the middle of the ninth inning of a 
game at the Chicago Cubs, as Blue Jays and Rockies management had kept 
negotiations secret from the media, Tulowitzki reportedly yelled at Rockies 
general manager Jeff Bridich and vowed never to speak to him or other members 
of the Rockies front office.[67] Tulowitzki expressed mixed emotions about 
the trade, but stated "I get the chance to play for a contender, and maybe 
this will revive my career a little bit." [68] Tulowitzki made his debut 
with the Blue Jays on July 29, and went 3–5 with a home run, 2 doubles, 
3 RBI, and 3 runs scored.[69] During a game against the New York Yankees 
on September 12, Tulowitzki collided with teammate Kevin Pillar while backpedaling 
to catch a fly ball in centerfield, and had to leave the game. He was expected 
to be out for a minimum of 2-3 weeks due to a cracked shoulder blade.[70] 
Tulowitzki returned to the lineup shortly before the end of the season, 
and in total appeared in 41 games for the Blue Jays in 2015, batting .239 
with 5 home runs and 17 RBI.[7] He played in all 5 games of the 2015 American 
League Division Series, batting .095 with 1 home run and 4 RBI.[7] In the 
third game of the 2015 American League Championship Series, Tulowitzki 
hit a three-run home run and was later ejected, and became the first American 
League player to be ejected from a postseason game since Dwight Gooden 
in 1998.[71] The Blue Jays would win the game, 11–8.[72] On May 13, 2016, 
Tulowitzki hit his 200th career home run in a win over the Texas Rangers.[73] 
On May 28, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a right quad 
strain.[74] He was reactivated on June 18.[75] Tulowitzki is of Polish 
descent,[76] and was born in Santa Clara, California.[77] Tulowitzki attended 
Fremont High School in Sunnyvale, California. He played Little League baseball 
with Sunnyvale National. Tulowitzki has a sister, Tiffany, who plays softball, 
and a brother, Tyler, who plays baseball for San Francisco State University.[78] 
Tulowitzki's favorite players growing up were Nomar Garciaparra and Derek 
Jeter. His jersey number in college was No. 5, due to his admiration of 
Garciaparra. His jersey number with the Rockies and Blue Jays is No. 2, 
due to his admiration of Jeter.[79] In a television interview with ESPN, 
Tulowitzki stated that his favorite team growing up was the Oakland Athletics 
and that his favorite musical artist is Jay-Z.[citation needed] In November 
2009, Tulowitzki married his high school sweetheart, Danyll Gammon, in 
Portola Valley, California.[80] In January 2014, the Tulowitzkis became
