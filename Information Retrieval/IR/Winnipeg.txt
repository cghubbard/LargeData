Winnipeg (i/ˈwɪnɪpɛɡ/) is the capital and largest city of the province 
of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North 
America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. The city 
is named after the nearby Lake Winnipeg; the name comes from the Western 
Cree words for muddy water. The region was a trading centre for aboriginal 
peoples long before the arrival of Europeans. French traders built the 
first fort on the site in 1738. A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk 
settlers of the Red River Colony in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated 
as the City of Winnipeg in 1873. As of 2011, Winnipeg is the seventh most 
populated municipality in Canada.[12] Being located very far inland, the 
local climate is extremely seasonal even by Canadian standards with average 
January lows of around −21 °C (−6 °F) and average July highs of 26 °C (79 °F).[7] 
Known as the "Gateway to the West", Winnipeg is a railway and transportation 
hub with a diversified economy. This multicultural city hosts numerous 
annual festivals, including the Festival du Voyageur, the Winnipeg Folk 
Festival, the Jazz Winnipeg Festival, the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, 
and Folklorama. Winnipeg was the first Canadian host of the Pan American 
Games. It is home to several professional sports franchises, including 
the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Canadian football), the Winnipeg Jets (ice hockey), 
Manitoba Moose (ice hockey) and the Winnipeg Goldeyes (baseball). Winnipeg 
lies at the confluence of the Assiniboine and the Red River of the North, 
a location now known as "The Forks". This point was at the crossroads of 
canoe routes travelled by First Nations before European contact.[13] Winnipeg 
is named after nearby Lake Winnipeg; the name is a transcription of the 
Western Cree words for muddy or brackish water.[14][15] Evidence provided 
by archaeology, petroglyphs, rock art and oral history indicates that native 
peoples used the area in prehistoric times for camping, harvesting, hunting, 
tool making, fishing, trading and, farther north, for agriculture.[16] 
Estimates of the date of first settlement in this area are varied and range 
from 11,500 years ago for a site southwest of the present city to 6,000 
years ago at The Forks.[15][17] In 1805, Canadian colonists observed First 
Nations peoples engaged in farming activity along the Red River. The practice 
quickly expanded, driven by the demand by traders for provisions.[18] The 
rivers provided an extensive transportation network linking northern First 
Peoples with those to the south along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. 
The Ojibwe made some of the first maps on birch bark, which helped fur 
traders navigate the waterways of the area.[19] Sieur de La Vérendrye built 
the first fur trading post on the site in 1738, called Fort Rouge.[20][21] 
French trading continued at this site for several decades before the arrival 
of the British Hudson's Bay Company after France ceded the territory following 
its defeat in the Seven Years' War.[22] Many French and later British men 
who were trappers married First Nations women; their mixed-race children 
hunted, traded, and lived in the area. They gradually developed as an ethnicity 
known as the Métis because of sharing a traditional culture.[23] Lord Selkirk 
was involved with the first permanent settlement (known as the Red River 
Colony), the purchase of land from the Hudson's Bay Company, and a survey 
of river lots in the early 19th century.[24] The North West Company built 
Fort Gibraltar in 1809, and the Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Douglas 
in 1812, both in the area of present-day Winnipeg.[25] The two companies 
competed fiercely over trade.[26] The Métis and Lord Selkirk's settlers 
fought at the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. In 1821, the Hudson's Bay and 
North West Companies merged, ending their long-standing rivalry.[27] Fort 
Gibraltar was renamed Fort Garry in 1822 and became the leading post in 
the region for the Hudson's Bay Company.[28] The fort was destroyed by 
a flood in 1826 and was not rebuilt until 1835.[28] A rebuilt section of 
the fort, consisting of the front gate and a section of the wall, can be 
found near the modern-day corner of Main Street and Broadway Avenue in 
downtown Winnipeg.[29] In 1869–70, present-day Winnipeg was the site of 
the Red River Rebellion, a conflict between the local provisional government 
of Métis, led by Louis Riel, and newcomers from eastern Canada. General 
Garnet Wolseley was sent to put down the uprising. The Manitoba Act of 
1870 made Manitoba the fifth province of the three-year-old Canadian Confederation.[30][31][32] 
On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city, with the Selkirk 
settlement as its nucleus.[33] Métis legislator and interpreter James McKay 
named the city.[34] Winnipeg developed rapidly after the coming of the 
Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881.[35] The railway divided the North End, 
which housed mainly Eastern Europeans, from the richer Anglo-Saxon southern 
part of the city.[15] It also contributed to a demographic shift beginning 
shortly after Confederation that saw the francophone population decrease 
from a majority to a small minority group. This shift resulted in Premier 
Thomas Greenway controversially ending legislative bilingualism and removing 
funding for French Catholic Schools in 1890.[36] By 1911, Winnipeg was 
Canada's third-largest city.[15] However, the city faced financial difficulty 
when the Panama Canal opened in 1914.[37] The canal reduced reliance on 
Canada's rail system for international trade; the increase in shipping 
traffic helped Vancouver to surpass Winnipeg in both prosperity and population 
by the end of World War I.[38] More than 30,000 workers walked off their 
jobs in May 1919 in what came to be known as the Winnipeg general strike.[39] 
The strike was a product of postwar recession, labour conditions, the activity 
of union organizers and a large influx of returning World War I soldiers 
seeking work.[40] After many arrests, deportations, and incidents of violence, 
the strike ended on 21 June 1919; when the Riot Act was read and a group 
of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers charged a group of strikers.[41] 
Two strikers were killed and at least thirty others were injured on the 
day that became known as Bloody Saturday; the event polarized the population.[41] 
One of the leaders of the strike, J. S. Woodsworth, went on to found Canada's 
first major socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, 
which later became the New Democratic Party.[42] The Manitoba Legislative 
Building, constructed mainly of Tyndall stone, opened in 1920; its dome 
supports a bronze statue finished in gold leaf, titled "Eternal Youth and 
the Spirit of Enterprise" (commonly known as the "Golden Boy").[43] The 
stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression resulted in widespread 
unemployment, worsened by drought and low agricultural prices.[44] The 
Depression ended after the start of World War II in 1939.[15] In the Battle 
of Hong Kong, The Winnipeg Grenadiers were among the first Canadians to 
engage in combat against Japan. Battalion members who survived combat were 
taken prisoner and endured brutal treatment in prisoner of war camps.[45] 
In 1942, the Victory Loan Campaign staged a mock Nazi invasion of Winnipeg 
to promote awareness of the stakes of the war in Europe.[46][47] When the 
war ended, pent-up demand generated a boom in housing development, although 
building activity was checked by the 1950 Red River flood.[48] The federal 
government estimated damage at over $26 million, although the province 
indicated that it was at least double that.[49] Prior to 1972, Winnipeg 
was the largest of thirteen cities and towns in a metropolitan area around 
the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. A consolidated metropolitan "unicity" government 
was established on 27 July 1971, taking effect in 1972.[50] The City of 
Winnipeg Act incorporated the current city.[15] Winnipeg experienced a 
severe economic downturn in advance of the early 1980s recession, during 
which the city incurred closures of prominent businesses, including the 
Winnipeg Tribune, as well as the Swift's and Canada Packers meat packing 
plants.[51] In 1981, Winnipeg was one of the first cities in Canada to 
sign a tripartite agreement with the provincial and federal governments 
to redevelop its downtown area,[52] and the three levels of government 
contributed over $271 million to its development.[53] In 1989, the reclamation 
and redevelopment of the CNR rail yards turned The Forks into Winnipeg's 
most popular tourist attraction.[13][15] The city was threatened by the 
1997 Red River flood as well as further floods in 2009 and 2011.[54] Winnipeg 
lies at the bottom of the Red River Valley, a flood plain with an extremely 
flat topography.[55] It is on the eastern edge of the Canadian Prairies 
in Western Canada and is known as the "Gateway to the West".[15] Winnipeg 
is bordered by tallgrass prairie to the west and south and the aspen parkland 
to the northeast, although most of the native prairie grasses have been 
removed for agriculture and urbanization.[56] It is relatively close to 
many large Canadian Shield lakes and parks, as well as Lake Winnipeg (the 
Earth's 11th largest freshwater lake).[57] Winnipeg contains North America's 
largest extant mature urban elm forest.[58] The city has a total area of 
464.08 km2 (179.18 sq mi).[5] Winnipeg has four major rivers: the Red, 
Assiniboine, La Salle and Seine.[59] The city was subject to severe flooding 
in the past. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in 1826. Another 
large flood occurred in 1950, which caused millions of dollars in damage 
and mass evacuations.[60] This flood prompted Duff Roblin's provincial 
government to build the Red River Floodway to protect the city; the project 
began in 1962 and was completed in 1968.[15] In the 1997 flood, flood control 
dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags; Winnipeg suffered very 
limited damage compared to the flood's impact on cities without such structures, 
such as Grand Forks, North Dakota.[61] The generally flat terrain and the 
poor drainage of the Red River Valley's clay-based soil also results in 
many mosquitoes during wetter years.[62] Winnipeg's location in the Canadian 
Prairies gives it a humid continental climate[63] (Köppen Dfb)[64] Summers 
have a July mean average of 19.7 °C (67.5 °F).[65] Winters are the coldest 
and driest time of year, with the January mean average around −16.4 °C 
(2.5 °F) and total winter precipitation averaging 55 mm (2.2 in).[66] Temperatures 
occasionally drop below −40.0 °C (−40 °F) [67] The actual air temperature 
drops below −30 °C (−22 °F) on average 12.6 days annually [7] and above 
30 °C (86 °F) 13.3 days of the year.[68] On average there are 317.8 days 
per year with measurable sunshine, with July seeing the most on average.[69] 
With 2353 hours of sunshine per year, Winnipeg is the second sunniest city 
in Canada.[70] Total annual precipitation (both rain and snow) is just 
over 20 inches (51 cm).[71] Thunderstorms are very common during summer, 
and sometimes severe enough to produce tornadoes.[72] Wind chill is an 
issue in the local climate. The wind chill has gone down as low as −57 °C 
(−71 °F) and on average there are 12 days of the year that can reach a 
wind chill below −40 °C (−40 °F).[7] The highest temperature ever recorded 
in Winnipeg was 42.2 °C (108 °F) on 11 July 1936 while the highest daily 
low temperature was 28.3 °C (83 °F) on July 12 1936[73] The apparent heat 
can be even more extreme due to bursts of humidity and on 25 July 2007 
a 47.3 °C (117.1 °F) reading of the humidex was measured.[7] The coldest 
temperature ever recorded was −47.8 °C (−54 °F) on 24 December 1879.[74] 
The frost-free season is comparatively long for a location with such severe 
winters. The last spring frost is on average around May 23, whilst the 
first fall frost is on September 22.[7] There are officially 236 neighbourhoods 
in Winnipeg.[78] Downtown Winnipeg, the city's financial heart and economic 
core, is centred on the intersection of Portage Avenue and Main Street. 
It covers an area of about 1 square mile (2.6 km2) and is the fastest growing 
high-income neighbourhood in the city.[79] More than 72,000 people work 
downtown, and over 40,000 students attend classes at its universities and 
colleges.[79] The past few decades have seen the downtown undergo major 
revitalization efforts; since 1999, over C$1.2 billion has been invested.[79] 
Downtown Winnipeg's Exchange District is named after the area's original 
grain exchange, which operated from 1880 to 1913.[79] The 30-block district 
received National Historic Site of Canada status in 1997; it includes North 
America's most extensive collection of early 20th-century terracotta and 
cut stone architecture, 62 of downtown Winnipeg's 86 heritage structures,[79] 
Stephen Juba Park, and Old Market Square.[79] Other major downtown areas 
are The Forks, Central Park, Broadway-Assiniboine and Chinatown. Many of 
Downtown Winnipeg's major buildings are linked with the Winnipeg Walkway.[80] 
Various residential neighbourhoods surround the downtown in all directions; 
expansion is greatest to the south and west, although several areas remain 
underdeveloped.[81] The largest park in the city, Assiniboine Park, houses 
the Assiniboine Park Zoo and the Leo Mol Sculpture Garden.[82] Other large 
city parks include Kildonan Park and St. Vital Park. The major commercial 
areas in the city are Polo Park, Kildonan Crossing, South St. Vital, Garden 
City (West Kildonan),Pembina Strip, Kenaston Smart Centre,Osborne Village, 
and the Corydon strip.[83] The main cultural and nightlife areas are the 
Exchange District, The Forks, Osborne Village and Corydon Village (both 
in Fort Rouge), Sargent and Ellice Avenues (West End) and Old St. Boniface.[84] 
Osborne Village is Winnipeg's most densely populated neighbourhood,[85] 
as well as one of the most densely populated neighbourhoods in Western 
Canada.[86] As of the Canada 2011 Census there were 663,617 people living 
in Winnipeg proper,[87] with approximately 730,018 living in the Winnipeg 
Census Metropolitan Area (CMA).[88] Thus, Winnipeg is Manitoba's largest 
city and Canada's seventh largest city. Furthermore, the city represents 
54.9% of the population of the province of Manitoba, the highest population 
concentration in one city of any province in Canada.[89][90] Apart from 
the city of Winnipeg, the Winnipeg CMA includes the rural municipalities 
of Springfield, St. Clements, Taché, East St. Paul, Macdonald, Ritchot, 
West St. Paul, Headingley, the Brokenhead 4 reserve, and Rosser and St. 
François Xavier.[91] Statistics Canada's estimate of the Winnipeg CMA population 
as of 1 July 2015 is 793,428.[92] As of the 2006 census, 48.3 percent of 
residents were male and 51.7 percent were female. 24.3 percent were 19 
years old or younger, 27.4 percent were between 20 and 30 years old, and 
34.0 percent were between 40 and 64 years old. The average age of a Winnipegger 
in May 2006 was 38.7, compared to an average of 39.5 for Canada as a whole.[94] 
Between the censuses of 2006 and 2011, Winnipeg's population increased 
by 4.8 percent, compared to 5.2 percent for Manitoba as a whole. The population 
density of the city of Winnipeg averaged 1,430 people per km2, compared 
with 2.2 for Manitoba.[95] Winnipeg has a significant and increasing Aboriginal 
population, with both the highest percentage of Aboriginal peoples (11.7%) 
for any major Canadian city, and the highest total number of Aboriginals 
(76,055) for any single non-reserve municipality.[93] The Aboriginal population 
grew by 22% between 2001 and 2006, compared to an increase of 3% for the 
city as a whole; this population tends to be younger and less wealthy than 
non-Aboriginal residents.[96] Winnipeg also has the highest Métis population 
in both percentage (6.3%) and numbers (41,005); the growth rate for this 
population between 2001 and 2006 was 30%.[93][96] The city has the greatest 
percentage of Filipino residents (8.7%) of any major Canadian city, although 
Toronto has more Filipinos by total population. In 2006, Winnipeg ranked 
seventh of the Canadian cities for percentage of residents of a visible 
minority.[93][97] The population is 67.5% white as of 2011 (down from 73.5% 
in 2006), while non-aboriginal visible minorities represent 21.4% as of 
2011 (up from 16.3% in 2006).[93][94] The city receives over 10,000 net 
international immigrants per year.[98] More than a hundred languages are 
spoken in Winnipeg, of which the most common is English: 99 percent of 
Winnipeggers are fluent English speakers, 88 percent speak only English, 
and 0.1 percent speak only French (Canada's other official language). 10 
percent speak both English and French, while 1.3 percent speak neither. 
Other languages spoken as a mother tongue in Winnipeg include Tagalog (5.0%), 
German (2.5%), and Punjabi and Ukrainian (both 1.4%). Several Aboriginal 
languages are also spoken, such as Ojibwe (0.3%) and Cree (0.2%).[95] The 
2011 National Household Survey reported the religious make-up of Winnipeg 
as: 63.7% Christian, including 29.7% Catholic, 8.1% United Church, and 
4.6% Anglican; 1.7% Muslim; 1.6% Jewish; 1.5% Sikh; 1.0% Hindu; 1.0% Buddhist; 
0.3% traditional (aboriginal) spirituality; 0.4% other; and 28.9% no religious 
affiliation.[93] Winnipeg is an economic base and regional centre. It has 
one of the country's most diversified economies,[107] with major employment 
in the trade (15.2%), manufacturing (9.8%), educational (7.7%), and health 
care and social assistance (15.2%) sectors.[107] There were approximately 
21,000 employers in the city as of 2012.[107] In 2013, The CIBC Metropolitan 
Economic Activity Index rated Winnipeg's economy as fourth in a national 
survey of 25 city economies, behind Toronto, Calgary, and Regina.[108] 
According to the Conference Board of Canada, Winnipeg is projected to experience 
a real GDP growth of 2 percent in 2014.[109] Unlike most of Canada, the 
city experienced a decrease in unemployment in 2013, ending the year at 
a rate of 5.8 percent.[110] As of 2010, median household income in the 
city was $72,050.[107] As of January 2014[update], approximately 416,700 
people are employed in Winnipeg and the surrounding area.[111] Some of 
Winnipeg's largest employers are government and government-funded institutions, 
including: the Province of Manitoba, the City of Winnipeg, the University 
of Manitoba, the Health Sciences Centre, and Manitoba Hydro.[112] Approximately 
54,000 people (14% of the work force) are employed in the public sector 
as of 2008.[113] Large private sector employers include Shaw Communications, 
Manitoba Telecom Services, Ipsos-Reid, Palliser Furniture, Great-West Life 
Assurance, Motor Coach Industries, New Flyer Industries, Boeing Canada 
Technology, Magellan Aerospace, Nygård International, Canad Inns, Canada 
Goose clothing and Investors Group.[114] The Royal Canadian Mint, established 
in 1976, is where all circulating coinage in Canada is produced.[115] The 
plant, located in southeastern Winnipeg, also produces coins for many other 
countries.[116] In 2012, Winnipeg was ranked by KPMG as the least expensive 
location to do business in western Canada.[117] Like many prairie cities, 
Winnipeg has a relatively low cost of living.[118] According to the Canadian 
Real Estate Association, the average house price in Winnipeg was $260,000 
as of 2013.[119] As of May 2014, the Consumer Price Index was 125.8 relative 
to 2002 prices, reflecting consumer costs at the Canadian average.[120][121] 
Winnipeg was named the Cultural Capital of Canada in 2010 by Canadian Heritage.[122] 
As of 2012, there are 26 National Historic Sites of Canada in Winnipeg.[123] 
One of these, The Forks, attracts four million visitors a year.[124] It 
is home to the City television studio, Manitoba Theatre for Young People, 
the Winnipeg International Children's Festival, and the Manitoba Children's 
Museum. It also features a 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) skate plaza, a 
8,500-square-foot (790 m2) bowl complex, the Esplanade Riel bridge,[125] 
a river walkway, Shaw Park, and the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.[124] 
The Winnipeg Public Library is a public library network with 20 branches 
throughout the city, including the main Millennium Library.[126] Winnipeg 
the Bear, which would later become the inspiration for part of the name 
of Winnie-the-Pooh, was purchased in Ontario by Lieutenant Harry Colebourn 
of the Fort Garry Horse. He named the bear after the regiment's home town 
of Winnipeg.[127] A. A. Milne later wrote a series of books featuring the 
fictional Winnie-the-Pooh. The series' illustrator, Ernest H. Shepard, 
created the only known oil painting of Winnipeg's adopted fictional bear, 
displayed in Assiniboine Park.[128] The city has developed many distinct 
dishes and cooking styles, notably in the areas of confectionery and hot-smoked 
fish. Both the First Nations and more recent Eastern Canadian, European, 
and Asian immigrants have helped shape Winnipeg's dining scene, giving 
birth to dishes such as the desserts schmoo torte and wafer pie.[129][130] 
Winnipeg's three largest performing arts venues, the Centennial Concert 
Hall, Manitoba Theatre Centre (MTC) and the Pantages Playhouse Theatre, 
are located downtown. MTC is Canada's oldest English-language regional 
theatre, with over 250 performances yearly.[131] The Pantages Playhouse 
Theatre opened as a vaudeville house in 1913.[132] Other city theatres 
include the Burton Cummings Theatre (a National Historic Site of Canada 
built in 1906[133]) and Prairie Theatre Exchange. Le Cercle Molière, based 
in St Boniface, is the oldest theatre company in Canada; it was founded 
in 1925.[134] Rainbow Stage is a musical theatre production company based 
in Kildonan Park that produces professional, live Broadway musical shows 
and is Canada's longest-surviving outdoor theatre.[15][135] The Manitoba 
Theatre for Young People at The Forks is one of only two Theatres for Young 
Audiences in Canada with a permanent residence, and is the only Theatre 
for Young Audiences that offers a full season of plays for teenagers.[136] 
The Winnipeg Jewish Theatre is the only professional theatre in Canada 
dedicated to Jewish themes.[137] Shakespeare in the Ruins (SIR) presents 
adaptations of Shakespeare plays.[138] Winnipeg has hosted a number of 
Hollywood productions: Shall We Dance? (2004), Capote (2005), The Assassination 
of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), and Goon (2011) among 
others had parts filmed in the city.[139] The Winnipeg Film Group has produced 
numerous award-winning films.[140] There are several TV and film production 
companies in Winnipeg: the most prominent are Farpoint Films, Frantic Films, 
Buffalo Gal Pictures, and Les Productions Rivard.[141] Guy Maddin's My 
Winnipeg, an independent film released in 2008, is a comedic rumination 
on the city's history.[142] The Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra is the largest 
and oldest professional musical ensemble in Winnipeg.[143] The Manitoba 
Chamber Orchestra runs a series of chamber orchestral concerts each year.[144] 
Manitoba Opera is Manitoba's only full-time professional opera company.[145] 
Among the most notable musical acts associated with Winnipeg are Bachman–Turner 
Overdrive,[146] the Crash Test Dummies,[147] The Guess Who,[148] Neil Young,[149] 
The Wailin' Jennys, and The Weakerthans.[146] The Royal Winnipeg Ballet 
(RWB) is Canada's oldest ballet company and the longest continuously operating 
ballet company in North America. It was the first organization to be granted 
a royal title by Queen Elizabeth II, and has included notable dancers such 
as Evelyn Hart and Mikhail Baryshnikov. The RWB also runs a full-time classical 
dance school.[150] The Manitoba Museum is the largest museum in the city, 
and depicts the history of the city and province. The full-size replica 
of the ship Nonsuch is the museum's showcase piece.[151] The Manitoba Children's 
Museum is a nonprofit children's museum located at The Forks that features 
twelve permanent galleries.[152][153] The Winnipeg Art Gallery is Western 
Canada's oldest public art gallery, founded in 1912. It is the sixth-largest 
in the country[154] and includes the world's largest public collection 
of contemporary Inuit art.[15][155] The Canadian Museum for Human Rights 
is the second Canadian national museum for human rights.[156] The federal 
government has contributed $100 million towards the estimated $311-million 
project.[157] Construction of the museum began on 1 April 2008,[158] and 
the museum opened to the public 27 September 2014.[159] The Western Canada 
Aviation Museum, located in a hangar at Winnipeg's James Richardson International 
Airport, features military jets, commercial aircraft, Canada's first helicopter, 
the "flying saucer" Avrocar, flight simulators, and a Black Brant rocket 
built in Manitoba by Bristol Aerospace.[160] The Winnipeg Railway Museum 
is located at Via Rail Station and contains various locomotives, notably 
the Countess of Dufferin, the first steam locomotive in Western Canada.[161] 
Festival du Voyageur, Western Canada's largest winter festival, celebrates 
the early French explorers of the Red River Valley.[162] Folklorama is 
the largest and longest-running cultural celebration festival in the world.[163] 
The Jazz Winnipeg Festival and the Winnipeg Folk Festival both celebrate 
Winnipeg's music community. The Winnipeg Music Festival offers a competition 
venue to amateur musicians. The Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival is the 
second-largest alternative theatre festival in North America.[164] The 
Winnipeg International Writers Festival (also called THIN AIR) brings writers 
to Winnipeg for workshops and readings.[165] The LGBT community in the 
city is served by Pride Winnipeg, an annual gay pride festival and parade, 
and Reel Pride, a film festival of LGBT-themed films.[166] Winnipeg has 
been home to several professional hockey teams. The Winnipeg Jets of the 
National Hockey League (NHL) have called the city home since 2011.[167] 
The original Winnipeg Jets, the city's former NHL team, left for Phoenix, 
Arizona after the 1995–96 season due to mounting financial troubles, despite 
a campaign effort to "Save the Jets".[168] The Jets play at MTS Centre, 
which is currently ranked the world's 19th-busiest arena among non-sporting 
touring events, 13th-busiest among facilities in North America, and 3rd-busiest 
in Canada as of 2009.[169] Past hockey teams based in Winnipeg include 
the Winnipeg Maroons, Winnipeg Warriors, three time Stanley Cup Champion 
Winnipeg Victorias and the Winnipeg Falcons, who were the first ever Gold 
Medal Olympians, representing Canada in 1920 in Antwerp, Belgium. Another 
professional ice hockey team presently located in Winnipeg is the Manitoba 
Moose, who are the American Hockey League primary affiliate of the Winnipeg 
Jets and owned by the same group .[170][171] In amateur hockey, the Winnipeg 
Blues of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League play out of the MTS Iceplex.[172] 
On the international stage, Winnipeg has hosted national and world hockey 
championships on a number of occasions, most notably the 1999 World Junior 
Hockey Championship and 2007 Women's World Hockey Championship.[173][174] 
The Winnipeg Blue Bombers play in the Canadian Football League. The Blue 
Bombers are ten-time Grey Cup champions, their last championship in 1990.[175] 
From 1953 to 2012, the Blue Bombers called Canad Inns Stadium home; they 
have since moved to Investors Group Field. Due to construction delays and 
cost overruns, the stadium was not ready in time for the 2012 CFL season, 
instead opening in 2013. The $200-million facility is also the home to 
the CIS' University of Manitoba Bisons and the Winnipeg Rifles of the Canadian 
Junior Football League.[176][177] The University of Manitoba Bisons and 
the University of Winnipeg Wesmen represent the city in interuniversity 
sport.[178] In soccer, it is represented by the Winnipeg Alliance FC in 
the Canadian Major Indoor Soccer League and the WSA Winnipeg in the USL 
Premier Development League.[179] Winnipeg has been home to a number of 
professional baseball teams, most recently the Winnipeg Goldeyes since 
1994. The Goldeyes play at Shaw Park, which was completed in 1999. The 
team had led the Northern League for ten straight years in average attendance 
through 2010, with more than 300,000 annual fan visits, until the league 
collapsed and merged into the American Association of Independent Professional 
Baseball.[180] Winnipeg was the first Canadian city to ever host the Pan 
American Games, and the second city to host the event twice, in 1967 and 
again in 1999.[181] The Pan Am Pool, built for the 1967 Pan Am Games, hosts 
aquatic events, including diving, speed swimming, synchronized swimming 
and water polo.[182] Winnipeg co-hosted the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.[183] 
The city has been selected to host the 2017 Canada Summer Games.[184] Winnipeg 
has three daily newspapers: the Winnipeg Free Press, the Winnipeg Sun, 
and the Metro Winnipeg.[185] There are five weekly newspapers delivered 
free to most Winnipeg households by region. There are also several ethnic 
weekly newspapers.[186] Television broadcasting in Winnipeg started in 
1954. The federal government refused to license any private broadcaster 
until the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation had created a national network. 
In May 1954, CBWT went on the air with four hours of broadcasting per day.[187] 
There are now five English-language stations and one French-language station 
based in Winnipeg. Additionally, some American network affiliates are available 
over-the-air.[188] Winnipeg is home to 33 AM and FM radio stations, two 
of which are French-language stations.[189] CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 
2 broadcast local and national programming in the city.[190] NCI is devoted 
to Aboriginal programming.[191] Since 1992, the city of Winnipeg has been 
represented by 15 city councillors and a mayor, both elected every four 
years.[192] The present mayor, Brian Bowman, was elected to office in 2014.[15] 
The city is a single-tier municipality, governed by a mayor-council system.[15] 
The structure of the municipal government is set by the provincial legislature 
in the City of Winnipeg Charter Act, which replaced the old City of Winnipeg 
Act in 2003.[193] The mayor is elected by direct popular vote to serve 
as the chief executive of the city.[194] At Council meetings, the mayor 
has one of 16 votes. The City Council is a unicameral legislative body, 
representing geographical wards throughout the city.[193] In provincial 
politics, Winnipeg is represented by 31 of the 57 provincial Members of 
the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). As of 2016, Winnipeg districts are represented 
by 17 members of the Progressive Conservative Party, 12 by the New Democratic 
Party (NDP), and 2 by the Liberal Party.[195] In federal politics, as of 
2015 Winnipeg is represented by eight Members of Parliament: seven Liberals 
and one New Democrat.[196] There are six Senators representing Manitoba 
in Ottawa: three Liberals, two Conservatives, and one Independent.[197] 
From 2007 to 2011, Winnipeg was the "murder capital" of Canada, with the 
highest per-capita rate of homicides; it fell to second place in 2012, 
behind Thunder Bay.[198][199] Winnipeg has had the highest violent crime 
index since 2009. The robbery rate in 2012 was between 250.1 and 272.9.[200][201] 
Despite high overall violent crime rates, crime in Winnipeg is mostly concentrated 
in the inner city, which makes up only 19% of the population[202] but was 
the site of 86.4% of the city's shootings, 66.5% of the robberies, 63.3% 
of the homicides and 59.5% of the sexual assaults in 2012.[200] From the 
early 1990s to the mid-2000s, Winnipeg had a significant auto-theft problem, 
with the rate peaking at 2,165.0 per 100,000 residents in 2006[203] compared 
to 487 auto-thefts per 100,000 residents for Canada as a whole.[204] To 
combat auto theft, Manitoba Public Insurance established financial incentives 
for motor vehicle owners to install ignition immobilizers in their vehicles, 
and now requires owners of high-risk vehicles to install immobilizers.[205] 
The auto-theft rate has been on a constant drop since 2006. Other types 
of property crime have also decreased, but rates are still fairly high.[201][206] 
Winnipeg is protected by the Winnipeg Police Service, which in 2012 had 
1,442 police officers.[206] In November 2013, the national police union 
reviewed the Winnipeg Police Force and found high average response times 
for several categories of calls.[207][208] There are seven school divisions 
in Winnipeg: Winnipeg School Division, St. James-Assiniboia School Division, 
Pembina Trails School Division, Seven Oaks School Division, Division Scolaire 
Franco-Manitobaine, River East Transcona School Division, and Louis Riel 
School Division.[209] Winnipeg also has a number of religious and secular 
private schools.[210][211] The University of Manitoba is the largest university 
in Manitoba.[212] It was founded in 1877, making it Western Canada's first 
university.[212] In a typical year, the university has an enrolment of 
24,500 undergraduate students and 4,000 graduate students.[213] Université 
de Saint-Boniface is the city's only French Canadian university.[214] The 
University of Winnipeg received its charter in 1967.[215] Until 2007, it 
was an undergraduate institution that offered some joint graduate studies 
programs; it now offers independent graduate programs.[215] The Canadian 
Mennonite University is a private Mennonite undergraduate university established 
in 1999.[216] Winnipeg also has two independent colleges: Red River College 
and Booth University College. Red River College offers diploma, certificate, 
and apprenticeship programs and, starting in 2009, began offering some 
degree programs.[217] Booth University College is a private Christian Salvation 
Army university college established in 1982. It offers mostly arts and 
seminary training.[218][219] Winnipeg has had public transit since 1882, 
starting with horse-drawn streetcars.[220] They were replaced by electric 
trolley cars. The trolley cars ran from 1892 to 1955, supplemented by motor 
buses after 1918, and electric trolleybuses from 1938 to 1970.[220] Winnipeg 
Transit now runs diesel buses on its routes.[221] Winnipeg is a railway 
hub and is served by Via Rail, Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific 
Railway, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Manitoba, and the Central Manitoba 
Railway. It is the only major city between Vancouver and Thunder Bay with 
direct US connections by rail.[222] Winnipeg is the largest and best connected 
city within Manitoba, and has highways leading in all directions from the 
city. To the south, Winnipeg is connected to the United States via Provincial 
Trunk Highway 75 (PTH 75) (a continuation of I-29 and US 75, known as Pembina 
Highway or Route 42 within Winnipeg). The highway runs 107 km (66 mi) to 
Emerson, Manitoba, and is the busiest Canada–United States border crossing 
on the Prairies.[223] The four-lane Perimeter Highway, built in 1969, serves 
as a Ring Road, with at-grade intersections and a few interchanges. It 
allows travellers on the Trans-Canada Highway to bypass the city. A recent 
study cited dangerous intersections and low efficiency as its primary shortfalls.[224] 
The Trans-Canada Highway runs east to west through the city (city route), 
or circles around the city on the Perimeter Highway (beltway). Some of 
the city's major arterial roads include Route 80 (Waverley St.), Route 
155 (McGillivray Blvd), Route 165 (Bishop Grandin Blvd.), Route 17 (Chief 
Peguis Trail), and Route 90 (Brookside Blvd., Oak Point Hwy., King Edward 
St., Century St., Kenaston Blvd.).[225] The Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson 
International Airport completed a $585-million redevelopment in October 
2011. The development includes a new terminal, a four-level parking facility, 
and other infrastructure improvements.[226] Winnipeg Bus Terminal, located 
at Winnipeg International Airport, offers domestic and international service 
by Greyhound Canada, Grey Goose Bus Lines, Winnipeg Shuttle Service and 
Brandon Air Shuttle.[227] Approximately 20,000 acres (81 km2) of land to 
the north and west of the airport has been designated as an inland port, 
CentrePort Canada, and is Canada's first Foreign Trade Zone. It is a private 
sector initiative to develop the infrastructure for Manitoba's trucking, 
air, rail and sea industries.[228] In 2009, construction began on a $212-million 
four-lane freeway that would eventually connect CentrePort with the Perimeter 
Highway.[229] Named CentrePort Canada Way, it was opened in November 2013.[230] 
Winnipeg is served by several taxi companies, the three largest being Unicity, 
Duffy's Taxi and Spring Taxi. Fifty percent of Winnipeg residents use a 
taxi at least once during the year.[231] Cycling is popular in Winnipeg, 
and there are many bicycle trails and lanes around the city. Winnipeg holds 
an annual Bike-to-Work Day[232] and Cyclovia,[233] and bicycle commuters 
may be seen year-round, even in the winter. Active living infrastructure 
in Winnipeg encourages bicycling through the inclusion of bike lanes[234] 
and sharrows.[235] Winnipeg's major hospitals include Health Sciences Centre, 
Concordia Hospital, Deer Lodge Centre, Grace Hospital, Misericordia Health 
Centre, Riverview Health Centre, Saint Boniface General Hospital, Seven 
Oaks General Hospital, Victoria General Hospital, and The Children's Hospital 
of Winnipeg.[236] The National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg is one 
of only a handful of biosafety level 4 microbiology laboratories in the 
world.[237] There are also research facilities operated through hospitals 
and private biotechnology companies.[238][239] Water and sewage services 
are provided by the city.[240] The city draws its water via an aqueduct 
from Shoal Lake, treating and fluoridating it at the Deacon Reservoir just 
outside the city prior to pumping it into the Winnipeg system.[241] The 
city's system comprises over 2,500 kilometres (1,600 mi) of underground 
water mains, which are subject to breakage during extreme weather conditions.[242] 
Electricity and natural gas are provided by Manitoba Hydro, a provincial 
crown corporation headquartered in the city; it uses primarily hydroelectric 
power.[243] The primary telecommunications carrier is MTS,[244] although 
a number of other corporations offer telephone, cellular, television and 
internet services in the city. Winnipeg contracts out several services 
to private companies, including garbage and recycling collection and street 
plowing and snow removal. This practice represents a significant budget 
expenditure and is more expansive than in comparable communities. The services 
have faced numerous complaints from residents in 2013–14 about missed service.[245][246][247] 
Canadian Forces Base Winnipeg, co-located at the airport, is home to many 
flight operations support divisions and several training schools. It is 
also the headquarters of 1 Canadian Air Division and the Canadian North 
American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Region,[248] as well as the 
home base of 17 Wing of the Canadian Forces. The Wing comprises three squadrons 
and six schools; it also provides support to the Central Flying School.[249] 
Excluding the three levels of government, 17 Wing is the fourth largest 
employer in the city.[250] The Wing supports 113 units, stretching from 
Thunder Bay to the Saskatchewan–Alberta border, and from the 49th parallel 
to the high Arctic.[249] 17 Wing also acts as a deployed operating base 
for CF-18 Hornet fighter-bombers assigned to the Canadian NORAD Region.[249] 
There are two squadrons based in the city. The 402 "City of Winnipeg" Squadron 
flies the Canadian-designed and produced de Havilland CT-142 Dash 8 navigation 
trainer.[251] The 435 "Chinthe" Transport and Rescue Squadron flies the 
Lockheed CC-130 Hercules in airlift search and rescue roles.[252] In addition, 
435 Squadron is the only Royal Canadian Air Force squadron equipped and 
trained to conduct tactical air-to-air refueling of fighter aircraft.[252] 
For many years, Winnipeg was the home of the Second Battalion of Princess 
Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. Initially, the battalion was based 
at the Fort Osborne Barracks, the location of which now houses the Rady 
Jewish Community Centre.[253] They eventually moved to the Kapyong Barracks 
located between River Heights and Tuxedo. Since 2004, the battalion has
