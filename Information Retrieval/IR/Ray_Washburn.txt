Ray Clark Washburn (born May 31, 1938 in Pasco, Washington) is a former 
Major League Baseball pitcher. Washburn, a right-hander, pitched for the 
St. Louis Cardinals from 1961 to 1969 and the Cincinnati Reds in 1970. 
A 1961 graduate of Whitworth University, Washburn, a $50,000 "bonus baby," 
went 12–9 with the Cardinals as a rookie in 1962. A shoulder muscle tear 
midway into the 1963 season sidelined him for the remainder of the year 
and limited his effectiveness for the next two years afterwards. Relying 
mostly on a curveball, Washburn returned to the starting rotation in 1966, 
winning 11 games against 9 losses; in 1967, he won 10 games against 7 losses 
on a Cardinal team that won the World Series, defeating the Boston Red 
Sox in seven games. He had missed nearly a month of action that season 
after his thumb was dislocated by a Johnny Roseboro line drive single on 
June 21.[1] 1968, the "Year of the Pitcher," was Washburn’s best season; 
he posted a 14–8 record with a 2.26 earned run average in a Bob Gibson-led 
rotation as the Cardinals repeated as National League champions. The wins 
and ERA were a career best, as was his strikeout total (124). Washburn 
also no-hit the San Francisco Giants 2–0 at Candlestick Park on September 
18 of that year;[2] the no-hitter was the first by a Cardinal since Lon 
Warneke in 1941 and came one day after the Giants’ Gaylord Perry had pitched 
a no-hitter of his own, defeating the Cardinals and Gibson—the first time 
in Major League history that back-to-back no-hitters had been pitched in 
the same series. In Game Three of the World Series against the Detroit 
Tigers, Washburn allowed home runs to Al Kaline and Dick McAuliffe but 
only two hits otherwise, and defeated the Tigers 7–3. However, he was shelled 
in Game Six, giving up five runs in two innings, the last three coming 
in a record-tying 10-run third inning for the Tigers, who won the game 
13–1. The Cardinals then lost Game Seven the very next day, and with it 
the Series, which they had been leading three games to one. Washburn slumped 
to 3–8 as a spot starter during the 1969 season, after which the Cardinals 
traded him to the Cincinnati Reds for another 1968 no-hit pitcher, George 
Culver. Washburn pitched mostly in relief on a Reds team that won the 1970 
National League pennant, its first in nine years. His last Major League 
appearance was in the final game of that year's World Series, in which 
the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Reds in five games. In his career, Washburn 
won 72 games and lost 64 with a 3.53 earned run average and struck out 
700 batters in 1209 2⁄3 innings pitched. On May 12, 1966, Washburn threw 
the first pitch in the history of Busch Stadium II; the Cardinals defeated 
the Atlanta Braves in 12 innings. He also pitched, as a Red, in the first
