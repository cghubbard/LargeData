Coordinates: 7°N 65°W﻿ / ﻿7°N 65°W﻿ / 7; -65 Venezuela (i/ˌvɛnəˈzweɪlə/ 
VEN-ə-ZWAYL-ə; Spanish: [beneˈswela]), officially the Bolivarian Republic 
of Venezuela (Spanish: República Bolivariana de Venezuela), is a federal 
republic located on the northern coast of South America. It is bordered 
by Colombia on the west, Brazil on the south, Guyana on the east, and the 
islands of Trinidad and Tobago to the north-east. Venezuela's territory 
covers around 916,445 km2 (353,841 sq mi) with an estimated population 
7007310283370000000♠31028337. Venezuela is considered a state with extremely 
high biodiversity (currently ranks 7th in the world's list of nations with 
the most number of species),[9] with habitats ranging from the Andes Mountains 
in the west to the Amazon Basin rain-forest in the south, via extensive 
llanos plains and Caribbean coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta 
in the east. The territory currently known as Venezuela was colonized by 
Spain in 1522 amid resistance from indigenous peoples. In 1811, it became 
one of the first Spanish-American colonies to declare independence, which 
was not securely established until 1821, when Venezuela was a department 
of the federal republic of Gran Colombia. It gained full independence as 
a separate country in 1830. During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered 
political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by regional caudillos 
(military strongmen) until the mid-20th century. Since 1958, the country 
has had a series of democratic governments. Economic shocks in the 1980s 
and 1990s led to several political crises, including the deadly Caracazo 
riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of President 
Carlos Andrés Pérez for embezzlement of public funds in 1993. A collapse 
in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 election of former coup-involved 
career officer Hugo Chávez and the launch of the Bolivarian Revolution, 
beginning with a 1999 Constituent Assembly to write a new Constitution 
of Venezuela. This new constitution officially changed the name of the 
country to República Bolivariana de Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela). 
Venezuela is a federal presidential republic consisting of 23 states, the 
Capital District (covering Caracas), and federal dependencies (covering 
Venezuela's offshore islands). Venezuela also claims all Guyanese territory 
west of the Essequibo River, a 159,500-square-kilometre (61,583 sq mi) 
tract dubbed Guayana Esequiba or the Zona en Reclamación (the "zone being 
reclaimed").[10] Venezuela is among the most urbanized countries in Latin 
America;[11][12] the vast majority of Venezuelans live in the cities of 
the north, especially in the capital (Caracas) which is also the largest 
city in Venezuela. Since the discovery of oil in the early 20th century, 
Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves and has been one of the 
world's leading exporters of oil. Previously an underdeveloped exporter 
of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa, oil quickly came 
to dominate exports and government revenues. The 1980s oil glut led to 
an external debt crisis and a long-running economic crisis, in which inflation 
peaked at 100% in 1996 and poverty rates rose to 66% in 1995[13] as (by 
1998) per capita GDP fell to the same level as 1963, down a third from 
its 1978 peak.[14] The recovery of oil prices in the early 2000s gave Venezuela 
oil funds not seen since the 1980s.[15] The Venezuelan government then 
initiated populist/revisionist policies that initially boosted the Venezuelan 
economy and increased social spending, significantly reducing economic 
inequality and poverty.[15][16][17][18] Such populist policies were questioned 
since their initiation and the over dependence on oil funds led to overspending 
on social programs while strict government polices, which were initially 
supposed to prevent capital flight, created difficulties for Venezuela's 
import-reliant businesses.[19][15][20][21] Venezuela under Hugo Chávez 
suffered "one of the worst cases of Dutch Disease in the world" due to 
the Bolivarian government's large dependence on oil sales.[22][23] Poverty 
and inflation began to increase into the 2010s.[24] Nicolás Maduro was 
elected in 2013 after the death of Chavez. Venezuela devalued its currency 
in February 2013 due to the rising shortages in the country,[25] which 
included those of milk, flour, and other necessities. This led to an increase 
in malnutrition, especially among children.[26][27] In 2014, Venezuela 
entered an economic recession.[28] In 2015, Venezuela had the world's highest 
inflation rate with the rate surpassing 100%, becoming the highest in the 
country's history.[29] Economic problems, as well as crime and corruption, 
were some of the main causes of the 2014–16 Venezuelan protests,[30][31] 
which left more than 50 protesters killed. In a July 22, 2016 decree, President 
Maduro used his executive power to declare a state of economic emergency. 
The decree could force citizens to work in agricultural fields and farms 
for 60-day (or longer) periods to supply food to the country.[32] Colombian 
border crossings have been temporarily opened to allow Venezuelans to purchase 
food and basic household and health items in Colombia in mid-2016.[33] 
In September 2016, a study published in the Spanish-language Diario Las 
Américas[34] indicated that 15% of Venezuelans are eating "food waste discarded 
by commercial establishments". In October 2016, Fox News Latino reported 
that during a month-long riot at the Táchira Detention Center in Caracas, 
40 inmates dismembered and consumed three fellow inmates. There have been 
close to 200 prison riots in Venezuela in 2016, with the cause being attributed 
to a worsening social situation, increasing poverty, and food shortages 
leading to over crowded prisons.[35] Venezuela is considered a major renowned 
player in beauty pageants (and the related cosmetics industry). Pageants 
and the following of them are popular pastimes with many Venezuelans. Representatives 
of the country have won 22 major pageant titles (as of 2016). According 
to the most popular and accepted version, in 1499, an expedition led by 
Alonso de Ojeda visited the Venezuelan coast. The stilt houses in the area 
of Lake Maracaibo reminded the navigator, Amerigo Vespucci, of the city 
of Venice, so he named the region Veneziola "Piccola Venezia".[36] The 
name acquired its current spelling as a result of Spanish influence,[36] 
where the suffix -uela is used as a diminutive term (e.g., plaza / plazuela, 
cazo / cazuela); thus, the term's original sense would have been that of 
a "little Venice".[37] The German language 16th century-term for the area, 
Klein-Venedig, also means little Venice (literally "small Venice"). However, 
Martín Fernández de Enciso, a member of the Vespucci and Ojeda crew, gave 
a different account. In his work Summa de geografía, he states that they 
found indigenous people who called themselves the Veneciuela. Thus, the 
name "Venezuela" may have evolved from the native word.[38] Evidence exists 
of human habitation in the area now known as Venezuela from about 15,000 
years ago; leaf-shaped tools from this period, together with chopping and 
planoconvex scraping implements, have been found exposed on the high riverine 
terraces of the Rio Pedregal in western Venezuela.[39] Late Pleistocene 
hunting artifacts, including spear tips, have been found at a similar series 
of sites in northwestern Venezuela known as "El Jobo"; according to radiocarbon 
dating, these date from 13,000 to 7,000 BC.[40] It is not known how many 
people lived in Venezuela before the Spanish conquest; it has been estimated 
at around one million.[41] In addition to indigenous peoples known today, 
the population included historic groups such as the Kalina (Caribs), Auaké, 
Caquetio, Mariche, and Timoto-Cuicas. The Timoto-Cuica culture was the 
most complex society in Pre-Columbian Venezuela; with pre-planned permanent 
villages, surrounded by irrigated, terraced fields. They also stored water 
in tanks.[42] Their houses were made primarily of stone and wood with thatched 
roofs. They were peaceful, for the most part, and depended on growing crops. 
Regional crops included potatoes and ullucos.[43] They left behind works 
of art, particularly anthropomorphic ceramics, but no major monuments. 
They spun vegetable fibers to weave into textiles and mats for housing. 
They are credited with having invented the arepa, a staple in Venezuelan 
cuisine. After the conquest, the population dropped markedly, mainly through 
the spread of new infectious diseases from Europe.[41] Two main north-south 
axes of pre-Columbian population were present, who cultivated maize in 
the west and manioc in the east.[41] Large parts of the llanos were cultivated 
through a combination of slash and burn and permanent settled agriculture.[41] 
In 1498, during his third voyage to the Americas, Christopher Columbus 
sailed near the Orinoco Delta and landed in the Gulf of Paria.[44] Amazed 
by the great offshore current of freshwater which deflected his course 
eastward, Columbus expressed in a letter to Isabella and Ferdinand that 
he must have reached Heaven on Earth (terrestrial paradise): Great signs 
are these of the Terrestrial Paradise, for the site conforms to the opinion 
of the holy and wise theologians whom I have mentioned. And likewise, the 
[other] signs conform very well, for I have never read or heard of such 
a large quantity of fresh water being inside and in such close proximity 
to salt water; the very mild temperateness also corroborates this; and 
if the water of which I speak does not proceed from Paradise then it is 
an even greater marvel, because I do not believe such a large and deep 
river has ever been known to exist in this world.[45] His certainty of 
having attained Paradise made him name this region 'Land of Grace', a phrase 
that has become the country's nickname. Spain's colonization of mainland 
Venezuela started in 1522, establishing its first permanent South American 
settlement in the present-day[update] city of Cumaná. In the 16th century, 
Venezuela was contracted as a concession by the King of Spain to the German 
Welser banking family (Klein-Venedig, 1528–1546). Native caciques (leaders) 
such as Guaicaipuro (circa 1530–1568) and Tamanaco (died 1573) attempted 
to resist Spanish incursions, but the newcomers ultimately subdued them; 
Tamanaco was put to death by order of Caracas' founder, Diego de Losada.[46] 
In the 16th century, during the Spanish colonization, indigenous peoples, 
such as many of the Mariches, themselves descendants of the Kalina, converted 
to Roman Catholicism. Some of the resisting tribes or leaders are commemorated 
in place names, including Caracas, Chacao, and Los Teques. The early colonial 
settlements focused on the northern coast,[41] but in the mid-18th century, 
the Spanish pushed farther inland along the Orinoco River. Here, the Ye'kuana 
(then known as the Makiritare) organized serious resistance in 1775 and 
1776.[47] Spain's eastern Venezuelan settlements were incorporated into 
New Andalusia Province. Administered by the Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo 
from the early 16th century, most of Venezuela became part of the Viceroyalty 
of New Granada in the early 18th century, and was then reorganized as an 
autonomous Captaincy General starting in 1777. The town of Caracas, founded 
in the central coastal region in 1567, was well-placed to become a key 
location, being near the coastal port of La Guaira whilst itself being 
located in a valley in a mountain range, providing defensive strength against 
pirates and a more fertile and healthy climate.[48] After a series of unsuccessful 
uprisings, Venezuela, under the leadership of Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan 
marshal who had fought in the American Revolution and the French Revolution, 
declared independence on 5 July 1811.[49] This began the Venezuelan War 
of Independence. However, a devastating earthquake that struck Caracas 
in 1812, together with the rebellion of the Venezuelan llaneros, helped 
bring down the first Venezuelan republic.[50] A second Venezuelan republic, 
proclaimed on 7 August 1813, lasted several months before being crushed, 
as well.[51] Sovereignty was only attained after Simón Bolívar, aided by 
José Antonio Páez and Antonio José de Sucre, won the Battle of Carabobo 
on 24 June 1821.[52] On 24 July 1823, José Prudencio Padilla and Rafael 
Urdaneta helped seal Venezuelan independence with their victory in the 
Battle of Lake Maracaibo.[53] New Granada's congress gave Bolívar control 
of the Granadian army; leading it, he liberated several countries and founded 
Gran Colombia.[52] Sucre, who won many battles for Bolívar, went on to 
liberate Ecuador and later become the second president of Bolivia. Venezuela 
remained part of Gran Colombia until 1830, when a rebellion led by Páez 
allowed the proclamation of a newly independent Venezuela; Páez became 
the first president of the new republic.[54] Between one-quarter and one-third 
of Venezuela's population was lost during these two decades of warfare 
which by 1830 was estimated at about 800,000.[55] The colors of the Venezuelan 
flag are yellow, blue, and red: the yellow stands for land wealth, the 
blue for the sea that separates Venezuela from Spain, and the red for the 
blood shed by the heroes of independence.[56] Slavery in Venezuela was 
abolished in 1854.[55] Much of Venezuela's 19th-century history was characterized 
by political turmoil and dictatorial rule,[57] including the Independence 
leader José Antonio Páez, who gained the presidency three times and served 
a total of 11 years between 1830 and 1863. This culminated in the Federal 
War (1859–1863), a civil war in which hundreds of thousands died, in a 
country with a population of not much more than a million people. In the 
latter half of the century, Antonio Guzmán Blanco, another caudillo, served 
a total of 13 years between 1870 and 1887, with three other presidents 
interspersed. In 1895, a longstanding dispute with Great Britain about 
the territory of Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British 
Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, erupted into the Venezuela 
Crisis of 1895. The dispute became a diplomatic crisis when Venezuela's 
lobbyist William L. Scruggs sought to argue that British behavior over 
the issue violated the United States' Monroe Doctrine of 1823, and used 
his influence in Washington, D.C., to pursue the matter. Then, US President 
Grover Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the doctrine that did 
not just simply forbid new European colonies, but declared an American 
interest in any matter within the hemisphere.[58] Britain ultimately accepted 
arbitration, but in negotiations over its terms was able to persuade the 
US on many of the details. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide 
the issue, and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British 
Guiana.[59] In 1899, Cipriano Castro, assisted by his friend Juan Vicente 
Gómez, seized power in Caracas, marching an army from his base in the Andean 
state of Táchira. Castro defaulted on Venezuela's considerable foreign 
debts, and declined to pay compensation to foreigners caught up in Venezuela's 
civil wars. This led to the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903, in which Britain, 
Germany, and Italy imposed a naval blockade of several months, before international 
arbitration at the new Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague was 
agreed. In 1908, another dispute broke out with the Netherlands, which 
was resolved when Castro left for medical treatment in Germany and was 
promptly overthrown by Juan Vicente Gómez. The discovery of massive oil 
deposits in Lake Maracaibo during World War I proved to be pivotal for 
Venezuela, and transformed the basis of its economy from a heavy dependence 
on agricultural exports. It prompted an economic boom that lasted into 
the 1980s; by 1935, Venezuela's per capita gross domestic product was Latin 
America's highest.[60] Gómez benefited handsomely from this, as corruption 
thrived, but at the same time, the new source of income helped him centralize 
the Venezuelan state and develop its authority. He remained the most powerful 
man in Venezuela until his death in 1935, although at times he ceded the 
presidency to others. The gomecista dictatorship system largely continued 
under Eleazar López Contreras, but from 1941, under Isaías Medina Angarita, 
was relaxed, with the latter granting a range of reforms, including the 
legalization of all political parties. After World War II, immigration 
from Southern Europe (mainly from Spain, Italy, Portugal, and France) and 
poorer Latin American countries markedly diversified Venezuelan society. 
In 1945, a civilian-military coup overthrew Medina Angarita and ushered 
in a three-year period of democratic rule under the mass membership Democratic 
Action, initially under Rómulo Betancourt, until Rómulo Gallegos won the 
Venezuelan presidential election, 1947 (generally believed to be the first 
free and fair elections in Venezuela). Gallegos governed until overthrown 
by a military junta led by Marcos Pérez Jiménez and Gallegos' Defense Minister 
Carlos Delgado Chalbaud in the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état. Pérez Jiménez 
was the most powerful man in the junta (though Chalbaud was its titular 
president), and was suspected of being behind the death in office of Chalbaud, 
who died in a bungled kidnapping in 1950. When the junta unexpectedly lost 
the election it held in 1952, it ignored the results and Pérez Jiménez 
was installed as President, where he remained until 1958. The military 
dictator Pérez Jiménez was forced out on 23 January 1958.[61] In an effort 
to consolidate the young democracy, the major political parties (with the 
notable exception of the Communist Party of Venezuela) signed the Punto 
Fijo Pact. Democratic Action and COPEI would dominate the political landscape 
for four decades. In the 1960s, substantial guerilla movements occurred, 
including the Armed Forces of National Liberation and the Revolutionary 
Left Movement, which had split from Democratic Action in 1960. Most of 
these movements lay down their arms under Rafael Caldera's presidency (1969–74); 
Caldera had won the 1968 election for COPEI, being the first time a party 
other than Democratic Action took the presidency through a democratic election. 
The election of Carlos Andrés Pérez in 1973 coincided with the 1973 oil 
crisis, in which Venezuela's income exploded as oil prices soared; oil 
industries were nationalized in 1976. This led to massive increases in 
public spending, but also increases in external debts, which continued 
into the 1980s when the collapse of oil prices during the 1980s crippled 
the Venezuelan economy. As the government started to devalue the currency 
in February 1983 to face its financial obligations, Venezuelans' real standards 
of living fell dramatically. A number of failed economic policies and increasing 
corruption in government led to rising poverty and crime, worsening social 
indicators, and increased political instability.[62] Economic crises in 
the 1980s and 1990s led to a political crisis in which hundreds died in 
the Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups d'état in 1992,[63] and 
the impeachment of President Carlos Andrés Pérez (re-elected in 1988) for 
corruption in 1993. Coup leader Hugo Chávez was pardoned in March 1994 
by president Rafael Caldera, with a clean slate and his political rights 
reinstated. The Bolivarian Revolution refers to a leftist social movement 
and political process in Venezuela led by late Venezuelan president Hugo 
Chávez, the founder of the Fifth Republic Movement and later the United 
Socialist Party of Venezuela. The "Bolivarian Revolution" is named after 
Simón Bolívar, an early 19th-century Venezuelan and Latin American revolutionary 
leader, prominent in the Spanish American wars of independence in achieving 
the independence of most of northern South America from Spanish rule. According 
to Chávez and other supporters, the "Bolivarian Revolution" seeks to build 
a mass movement to implement Bolivarianism—popular democracy, economic 
independence, equitable distribution of revenues, and an end to political 
corruption—in Venezuela. They interpret Bolívar's ideas from a socialist 
perspective. A collapse in confidence in the existing parties led to Chávez 
being elected president in 1998, and the subsequent launch of a "Bolivarian 
Revolution", beginning with a 1999 Constituent Assembly to write a new 
Constitution of Venezuela. Chávez also initiated Bolivarian missions, programs 
aimed at helping the poor. In April 2002, Chávez was briefly ousted from 
power in the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt following popular demonstrations 
by his opponents,[64] but he was returned to power after two days as a 
result of demonstrations by poor Chávez supporters in Caracas and actions 
by the military.[65][66] Chávez also remained in power after an all-out 
national strike that lasted from December 2002 to February 2003, including 
a strike/lockout in the state oil company PDVSA. The strike produced severe 
economic dislocation, with the country's GDP falling 27% during the first 
four months of 2003, and costing the oil industry $13.3 billion.[67] Capital 
flight before and during the strike led to the reimposition of currency 
controls (which had been abolished in 1989), managed by the CADIVI agency. 
In the subsequent decade, the government was forced into several currency 
devaluations.[68][69][70][71][72] These devaluations have done little to 
improve the situation of the Venezuelan people who rely on imported products 
or locally produced products that depend on imported inputs while dollar-denominated 
oil sales account for the vast majority of Venezuela's exports.[73] The 
profits of the oil industry have been lost to "social engineering" and 
corruption, instead of investments needed to maintain oil production.[74] 
Chávez survived several further political tests, including an August 2004 
recall referendum. He was elected for another term in December 2006 and 
re-elected for a third term in October 2012. However, he was never sworn 
in for his third period, due to medical complications. Chávez died on 5 
March 2013 after a nearly two-year fight with cancer.[75] The presidential 
election that took place on Sunday, 14 April 2013, was the first since 
Chávez took office in 1999 in which his name did not appear on the ballot.[76] 
Nicolás Maduro has been the President of Venezuela since 14 April 2013, 
after winning the second presidential election after Chávez's death, with 
50.61% of the votes against the opposition's candidate Henrique Capriles 
Radonski who had 49.12% of the votes. The Democratic Unity Roundtable contested 
his appointment as a violation of the constitution. However, the Supreme 
Court of Venezuela ruled that under Venezuela's Constitution, Nicolás Maduro 
is the legitimate president and was invested as such by the Venezuelan 
National Assembly (Asamblea Nacional).[77][78][79] Beginning in February 
2014, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have protested over high levels 
of criminal violence, corruption, hyperinflation, and chronic scarcity 
of basic goods due to policies of the federal government.[80][81][82][83][84] 
Demonstrations and riots have left over 40 fatalities in the unrest between 
both Chavistas and opposition protesters,[85] and has led to the arrest 
of opposition leaders such as Leopoldo López[85][86] and Antonio Ledezma.[87][88][89][90] 
Human rights groups have strongly condemned the arrest of Leopoldo López.[91] 
In the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary election, the opposition gained a 
majority.[92] Venezuela is located in the north of South America; geologically, 
its mainland rests on the South American Plate. It has a total area of 
916,445 km2 (353,841 sq mi) and a land area of 882,050 square kilometres 
(340,560 sq mi), making it the 33rd largest country in the world. The territory 
it controls lies between latitudes 0° and 13°N, and longitudes 59° and 
74°W. Shaped roughly like a triangle, the country has a 2,800 km (1,700 mi) 
coastline in the north, which includes numerous islands in the Caribbean, 
and in the northeast borders the northern Atlantic Ocean. Most observers 
describe Venezuela in terms of four fairly well-defined topographical regions: 
the Maracaibo lowlands in the northwest, the northern mountains extending 
in a broad east-west arc from the Colombian border along the northern Caribbean 
coast, the wide plains in central Venezuela, and the Guiana Highlands in 
the southeast. The northern mountains are the extreme northeastern extensions 
of South America's Andes mountain range. Pico Bolívar, the nation's highest 
point at 4,979 m (16,335 ft), lies in this region. To the south, the dissected 
Guiana Highlands contain the northern fringes of the Amazon Basin and Angel 
Falls, the world's highest waterfall, as well as tepuis, large table-like 
mountains. The country's center is characterized by the llanos, which are 
extensive plains that stretch from the Colombian border in the far west 
to the Orinoco River delta in the east. The Orinoco, with its rich alluvial 
soils, binds the largest and most important river system of the country; 
it originates in one of the largest watersheds in Latin America. The Caroní 
and the Apure are other major rivers. Venezuela borders Colombia to the 
west, Guyana to the east, and Brazil to the south. Caribbean islands such 
as Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Curaçao, Aruba, and the Leeward Antilles 
lie near the Venezuelan coast. Venezuela has territorial disputes with 
Guyana (formerly United Kingdom), largely concerning the Essequibo area, 
and with Colombia concerning the Gulf of Venezuela. In 1895, after years 
of diplomatic attempts to solve the border dispute, from Venezuela, the 
dispute over the Essequibo River border flared up, it was submitted to 
a "neutral" commission (composed of British, American, and Russian representatives 
and without a direct Venezuelan representative), which in 1899 decided 
mostly against Venezuela's claim.[93] Venezuela's most significant natural 
resources are petroleum and natural gas, iron ore, gold, and other minerals. 
It also has large areas of arable land and water. Salto Aponwao in Bolívar

Venezuela is entirely located in the tropics over the Equator to around 
12° N. Its climate varies from humid low-elevation plains, where average 
annual temperatures range as high as 35 °C (95.0 °F), to glaciers and highlands 
(the páramos) with an average yearly temperature of 8 °C (46.4 °F). Annual 
rainfall varies from 430 mm (16.9 in) in the semiarid portions of the northwest 
to over 1,000 mm (39.4 in) in the Orinoco Delta of the far east and the 
Amazonian Jungle in the south. The precipitation level is lower in the 
period from November to April and later in the year from August to October. 
These periods are referred to as hot-humid and cold-dry seasons. Another 
characteristic of the climate is this variation throughout the country 
by the existence of a mountain range called "Cordillera de la Costa" which 
crosses the country from east to west. The majority of the population lives 
in these mountains.[57] The country falls into four horizontal temperature 
zones based primarily on elevation, having tropical, dry, temperate with 
dry winters, and polar (alpine tundra) climates, amongst others.[94][95][96] 
In the tropical zone—below 800 m (2,625 ft)—temperatures are hot, with 
yearly averages ranging between 26 and 28 °C (78.8 and 82.4 °F). The temperate 
zone ranges between 800 and 2,000 m (2,625 and 6,562 ft) with averages 
from 12 to 25 °C (53.6 to 77.0 °F); many of Venezuela's cities, including 
the capital, lie in this region. Colder conditions with temperatures from 
9 to 11 °C (48.2 to 51.8 °F) are found in the cool zone between 2,000 and 
3,000 m (6,562 and 9,843 ft), especially in the Venezuelan Andes, where 
pastureland and permanent snowfield with yearly averages below 8 °C (46 °F) 
cover land above 3,000 meters (9,843 ft) in the páramos. The highest temperature 
recorded was 42 °C (108 °F) in Machiques,[97] and the lowest temperature 
recorded was −11 °C (12 °F), it has been reported from an uninhabited high 
altitude at Páramo de Piedras Blancas (Mérida state),[98] even though no 
official reports exist, lower temperatures in the mountains of the Sierra 
Nevada de Mérida are known. Tropical savanna climate (Aw) in Los Llanos

large portions of the country were originally covered by moist broadleaf 
forests. One of 17 megadiverse countries,[99] Venezuela's habitats range 
from the Andes Mountains in the west to the Amazon Basin rainforest in 
the south, via extensive llanos plains and Caribbean coast in the center 
and the Orinoco River Delta in the east. They include xeric scrublands 
in the extreme northwest and coastal mangrove forests in the northeast.[57] 
Its cloud forests and lowland rainforests are particularly rich.[100] Animals 
of Venezuela are diverse and include manatees, three-toed sloth, two-toed 
sloth, Amazon river dolphins, and Orinoco crocodiles, which have been reported 
to reach up to 6.6 m (22 ft) in length. Venezuela hosts a total of 1,417 
bird species, 48 of which are endemic.[101] Important birds include ibises, 
ospreys, kingfishers,[100] and the yellow-orange Venezuelan troupial, the 
national bird. Notable mammals include the giant anteater, jaguar, and 
the capybara, the world's largest rodent. More than half of Venezuelan 
avian and mammalian species are found in the Amazonian forests south of 
the Orinoco.[102] For the fungi, an account was provided by R.W.G. Dennis[103] 
which has been digitized and the records made available on-line as part 
of the Cybertruffle Robigalia database.[104] That database includes nearly 
3,900 species of fungi recorded from Venezuela, but is far from complete, 
and the true total number of fungal species already known from Venezuela 
is likely higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 
7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.[105] Among plants 
of Venezuela, over 25,000 species of orchids are found in the country's 
cloud forest and lowland rainforest ecosystems.[100] These include the 
flor de mayo orchid (Cattleya mossiae), the national flower. Venezuela's 
national tree is the araguaney, whose characteristic lushness after the 
rainy season led novelist Rómulo Gallegos to name it "[l]a primavera de 
oro de los araguaneyes" (the golden spring of the araguaneyes). Venezuela 
is among the top 20 countries in terms of endemism.[106] Among its animals, 
23% of reptilian and 50% of amphibian species are endemic.[106] Although 
the available information is still very small, a first effort has been 
made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Venezuela: 1334 
species of fungi have been tentatively identified as possible endemics 
of the country.[107] Some 38% of the over 21,000 plant species known from 
Venezuela are unique to the country.[106] Venezuela is one of the 10 most 
biodiverse countries on the planet, yet it is one of the leaders of deforestation 
due to economic and political factors. Each year, roughly 287,600 hectares 
of forest are permanently destroyed and other areas are degraded by mining, 
oil extraction, and logging. Between 1990 and 2005, Venezuela officially 
lost 8.3% of its forest cover, which is about 4.3 million ha. In response, 
federal protections for critical habitat were implemented; for example, 
20% to 33% of forested land is protected.[102] The country's biosphere 
reserve is part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; five wetlands 
are registered under the Ramsar Convention.[108] In 2003, 70% of the nation's 
land was under conservation management in over 200 protected areas, including 
43 national parks.[109] Venezuela's 43 national parks include Canaima National 
Park, Morrocoy National Park, and Mochima National Park. In the far south 
is a reserve for the country's Yanomami tribes. Covering 32,000 square 
miles (82,880 square kilometres), the area is off-limits to farmers, miners, 
and all non-Yanomami settlers. Venezuela was one of the few countries that 
didn't enter an INDC at COP21.[110][111] Following the fall of Marcos Pérez 
Jiménez in 1958, Venezuelan politics were dominated by the Third Way Christian 
democratic COPEI and the center-left social democratic Democratic Action 
(AD) parties; this two-party system was formalized by the puntofijismo 
arrangement. Economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s led to a political 
crisis which resulted in hundreds dead in the Caracazo riots of 1989, two 
attempted coups in 1992, and impeachment of President Carlos Andrés Pérez 
for corruption in 1993. A collapse in confidence in the existing parties 
saw the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, who had led the first of the 1992 
coup attempts, and the launch of a "Bolivarian Revolution", beginning with 
a 1999 Constituent Assembly to write a new Constitution of Venezuela. The 
opposition's attempts to unseat Chávez included the 2002 Venezuelan coup 
d'état attempt, the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–2003, and the Venezuelan 
recall referendum, 2004, all of which failed. Chávez was re-elected in 
December 2006, but suffered a significant defeat in 2007 with the narrow 
rejection of the Venezuelan constitutional referendum, 2007, which had 
offered two packages of constitutional reforms aimed at deepening the Bolivarian 
Revolution. Two major blocs of political parties are in Venezuela: the 
incumbent leftist bloc United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), its 
major allies Fatherland for All (PPT) and the Communist Party of Venezuela 
(PCV), and the opposition bloc grouped into the electoral coalition Mesa 
de la Unidad Democrática. This includes A New Era (UNT) together with allied 
parties Project Venezuela, Justice First, Movement for Socialism (MAS) 
and others. Hugo Chávez, the central figure of the Venezuelan political 
landscape since his election to the Presidency in 1998 as a political outsider, 
died in office in early 2013, and was succeeded by Nicolás Maduro (initially 
as interim President, before narrowly winning the Venezuelan presidential 
election, 2013). The Venezuelan president is elected by a vote, with direct 
and universal suffrage, and is both head of state and head of government. 
The term of office is six years, and (as of 15 February 2009) a president 
may be re-elected an unlimited number of times. The president appoints 
the vice president and decides the size and composition of the cabinet 
and makes appointments to it with the involvement of the legislature. The 
president can ask the legislature to reconsider portions of laws he finds 
objectionable, but a simple parliamentary majority can override these objections. 
The president may ask the National Assembly to pass an enabling act granting 
the ability to rule by decree in specified policy areas; this requires 
a two-thirds majority in the Assembly. Since 1959, six Venezuelan presidents 
have been granted such powers. The unicameral Venezuelan parliament is 
the Asamblea Nacional ("National Assembly"). The number of members is variable 
– each state and the Capital district elect three representatives plus 
the result of dividing the state population by 1.1% of the total population 
of the country.[112] Three seats are reserved for representatives of Venezuela's 
indigenous peoples. For the 2011–2016 period the number of seats is 165.[113] 
All deputies serve five-year terms. The voting age in Venezuela is 18 and 
older. Voting is not compulsory.[114] The legal system of Venezuela belongs 
to the Continental Law tradition. The highest judicial body is the Supreme 
Tribunal of Justice or Tribunal Supremo de Justicia, whose magistrates 
are elected by parliament for a single two-year term. The National Electoral 
Council (Consejo Nacional Electoral, or CNE) is in charge of electoral 
processes; it is formed by five main directors elected by the National 
Assembly. Supreme Court president Luisa Estela Morales said in December 
2009 that Venezuela had moved away from "a rigid division of powers" toward 
a system characterized by "intense coordination" between the branches of 
government. Morales clarified that each power must be independent adding 
that "one thing is separation of powers and another one is division".[115] 
Parliamentary Elections were held in Venezuela on 6 December 2015 to elect 
the 164 deputies and three indigenous representatives of the National Assembly. 
In 2014, a series of protest and demonstrations began in Venezuela, attributed 
to inflation, violence and shortages in Venezuela. The government has accused 
the protest of being motivated by 'fascists' opposition leaders, capitalism 
and foreign influence,[116] despite being largely peaceful.[117] President 
Maduro acknowledged PSUV defeat, but attributed the opposition's victory 
to an intensification of the "economic war". Despite of that, Maduro said 
"I will stop by hook or by crook the opposition coming to power, whatever 
the costs, in any way".[118] In the following months, Maduro fulfilled 
his promise of avoiding the elected democratically and constitutionally 
National Assembly to legislate. First step taken by PSUV and government 
where the substitution of the entire Supreme Court a day after the Parliamentary 
Elections[119] contrary to the Constitution of Venezuela, acclaimed as 
a fraud by the majority of the Venezuelan and international press.[120][121][122][123] 
The PSUV government used this violation to suspend several elected opponents,[124] 
ignoring again the Constitution of Venezuela. Maduro said that "the Amnesty 
law (approved by the Parliament) will not be executed" and asked the Supreme 
Court to declare it unconstitutional before the law was known.[125] In 
January, 16th 2016, Maduro approved an unconstitutional economic emergency 
decree,[126] relegating to his own figure the legislative and executive 
powers, while also holding judiciary power through the fraudulent designation 
of judges the day after the election on 6 December 2015.[119][120][121][122][123] 
From these events, Maduro effectively controls the three democratic powers. 
On 14 May 2016, constitutional guarantees were in fact suspended when Maduro 
decreed the extension of the economic emergency decree for another 60 days 
and declares a State of emergency,[127] which is a clear violation of the 
Constitution of Venezuela[128] in the Article 338th: "The approval of the 
extension of States of emergency corresponds to the National Assembly.". 
Thus, constitutional rights in Venezuela are considered suspended in fact 
by a large number of publications[129][130][131] and public figures.[132][133][134][135] 
On 14 May 2016, the Organization of American States manifest to be studying 
to Apply the Inter-American Democratic Charter[136] with sanctions for 
non-compliance to its own Constitution to Venezuela. Throughout most of 
the 20th century, Venezuela maintained friendly relations with most Latin 
American and Western nations. Relations between Venezuela and the United 
States government worsened in 2002, after the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état 
attempt during which the U.S. government recognized the short-lived interim 
presidency of Pedro Carmona. In 2015, Venezuela was declared a national 
security threat by U.S. President Barack Obama.[137][138][139] Correspondingly, 
ties to various Latin American and Middle Eastern countries not allied 
to the U.S. have strengthened. For example, Palestinian foreign minister 
Riyad al-Maliki declared in 2015 that Venezuela was his country's "most 
important ally".[140] Venezuela seeks alternative hemispheric integration 
via such proposals as the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas trade 
proposal and the newly launched pan-Latin American television network teleSUR. 
Venezuela is one of the six nations in the world—along with Russia, Nicaragua, 
Nauru, Vanuatu, and Tuvalu—to have recognized the independence of Abkhazia 
and South Ossetia. Venezuela was a proponent of OAS's decision to adopt 
its Anti-Corruption Convention, and is actively working in the Mercosur 
trade bloc to push increased trade and energy integration. Globally, it 
seeks a "multi-polar" world based on strengthened ties among undeveloped 
countries. The Bolivarian National Armed Forces of the Bolivarian Republic 
of Venezuela (Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana, FANB) are the overall 
unified military forces of Venezuela. It includes over 320,150 men and 
women, under Article 328 of the Constitution, in 5 components of Ground, 
Sea and Air. The components of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces are: 
the Venezuelan Army, the Venezuelan Navy, the Venezuelan Air Force, the 
Venezuelan National Guard, and the Venezuelan National Militia. As of 2008[update], 
a further 600,000 soldiers were incorporated into a new branch, known as 
the Armed Reserve. The President of Venezuela is the commander-in-chief 
of the national armed forces. The main roles of the armed forces are to 
defend the sovereign national territory of Venezuela, airspace, and islands, 
fight against drug trafficking, to search and rescue and, in the case of 
a natural disaster, civil protection. All male citizens of Venezuela have 
a constitutional duty to register for the military service at the age of 
18, which is the age of majority in Venezuela. Venezuela was the most murderous 
place on Earth in 2015.[149] In Venezuela, a person is murdered every 21 
minutes.[150] Violent crimes have been so prevalent in Venezuela that the 
government no longer produces the crime data.[151] In 2013, the homicide 
rate was approximately 79 per 100,000, one of the world's highest, having 
quadrupled in the past 15 years with over 200,000 people murdered.[152] 
By 2015 it had risen to 90 per 100,000.[149] The country's body count of 
the previous decade mimics that of the Iraq War and in some instances had 
more civilian deaths even though the country is at peacetime.[153] The 
capital Caracas has one of the greatest homicide rates of any large city 
in the world, with 122 homicides per 100,000 residents.[154] In 2008, polls 
indicated that crime was the number one concern of voters.[155] Attempts 
at fighting crime such as Operation Liberation of the People have been 
done to crack down on gang-controlled areas.[156] Venezuela is especially 
dangerous toward foreign travelers and investors who are visiting. The 
United States State Department and the Government of Canada have warned 
foreign visitors that they may be subjected to robbery, kidnapping for 
a ransom or sale to terrorist organizations[157] and murder, and that their 
own diplomatic travelers are required to travel in armored vehicles.[158][159] 
The United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised against 
all travel to Venezuela.[160] Visitors have been murdered during robberies 
and criminals do not discriminate among their victims. Recently, former 
Miss Venezuela 2004 winner Monica Spear and her husband were murdered with 
her 5-year-old daughter being shot while visiting, and an elderly German 
tourist was murdered only a few weeks later.[161][162] There are approximately 
33 prisons holding about 50,000 inmates.[163] They include; El Rodeo outside 
of Caracas, Yare Prison in the northern state of Miranda, and several others. 
Venezuela's prison system is heavily overcrowded; its facilities have capacity 
for only 14,000 prisoners.[164] Corruption in Venezuela is high by world 
standards, and was so for much of the 20th century. The discovery of oil 
had worsened political corruption,[165] and by the late 1970s, Juan Pablo 
Pérez Alfonso's description of oil as "the Devil's excrement" had become 
a common expression in Venezuela.[166] Venezuela has been ranked one of 
the most corrupt countries on the Corruption Perceptions Index since the 
survey started in 1995. The 2010 ranking placed Venezuela at number 164, 
out of 178 ranked countries.[167] Similarly, the World Justice Project 
ranked Venezuela 99th out of 99 countries surveyed in its 2014 Rule of 
Law Index.[168] This corruption is shown with Venezuela's significant involvement 
in drug trafficking, with Colombian cocaine and other drugs transiting 
Venezuela towards the United States and Europe. Venezuela ranks fourth 
in the world for cocaine seizures, behind Colombia, the United States, 
and Panama.[169] In 2006 the government's agency for combating the Illegal 
drug trade in Venezuela, ONA, was incorporated into the office of the Vice-President 
of the country. However, many major government and military officials have 
been known for their involvement with drug trafficking; especially with 
the October 2013 incident of men from the Venezuelan National Guard placing 
1.3 tons of cocaine on a Paris flight knowing they will not face charges.[170] 
Venezuela is divided into 23 states (estados), a capital district (distrito 
capital) corresponding to the city of Caracas, and the Federal Dependencies 
(Dependencias Federales, a special territory). Venezuela is further subdivided 
into 335 municipalities (municipios); these are subdivided into over one 
thousand parishes (parroquias). The states are grouped into nine administrative 
regions (regiones administrativas), which were established in 1969 by presidential 
decree. The country can be further divided into ten geographical areas, 
some corresponding to climatic and biogeographical regions. In the north 
are the Venezuelan Andes and the Coro region, a mountainous tract in the 
northwest, holds several sierras and valleys. East of it are lowlands abutting 
Lake Maracaibo and the Gulf of Venezuela. The Central Range runs parallel 
to the coast and includes the hills surrounding Caracas; the Eastern Range, 
separated from the Central Range by the Gulf of Cariaco, covers all of 
Sucre and northern Monagas. The Insular Region includes all of Venezuela's 
island possessions: Nueva Esparta and the various Federal Dependencies. 
The Orinoco Delta, which forms a triangle covering Delta Amacuro, projects 
northeast into the Atlantic Ocean. The Central Bank of Venezuela is responsible 
for developing monetary policy for the Venezuelan bolívar which is used 
as currency. The currency is primarily printed on paper and distributed 
throughout the country. The President of the Central Bank of Venezuela 
is presently Eudomar Tovar, who also serves as the country's representative 
in the International Monetary Fund. According to the Heritage Foundation 
and the Wall Street Journal, Venezuela has the weakest property rights 
in the world, scoring only 5.0 on a scale of 100; expropriation without 
compensation is not uncommon. Venezuela has a Market-based mixed economy 
dominated by the petroleum sector, which accounts for roughly a third of 
GDP, around 80% of exports, and more than half of government revenues. 
Per capita GDP for 2009 was US$13,000, ranking 85th in the world.[61] Venezuela 
has the least expensive petrol in the world because the consumer price 
of petrol is heavily subsidized. More than 60% of Venezuela's international 
reserves is in gold, eight times more than the average for the region. 
Most of Venezuela's gold held abroad is located in London. On 25 November 
2011, the first of US$11 billion of repatriated gold bullion arrived in 
Caracas; Chávez called the repatriation of gold a "sovereign" step that 
will help protect the country's foreign reserves from the turmoil in the 
U.S. and Europe.[174] However government policies quickly spent down this 
returned gold and in 2013 the government was forced to add the dollar reserves 
of state owned companies to those of the national bank in order to reassure 
the international bond market.[175] Manufacturing contributed 17% of GDP 
in 2006. Venezuela manufactures and exports heavy industry products such 
as steel, aluminium and cement, with production concentrated around Ciudad 
Guayana, near the Guri Dam, one of the largest in the world and the provider 
of about three-quarters of Venezuela's electricity. Other notable manufacturing 
includes electronics and automobiles, as well as beverages, and foodstuffs. 
Agriculture in Venezuela accounts for approximately 3% of GDP, 10% of the 
labor force, and at least a quarter of Venezuela's land area. Venezuela 
exports rice, corn, fish, tropical fruit, coffee, beef, and pork. The country 
is not self-sufficient in most areas of agriculture. In 2012, total food 
consumption was over 26 million metric tonnes, a 94.8% increase from 2003.[176] 
Since the discovery of oil in the early 20th century, Venezuela has been 
one of the world's leading exporters of oil, and it is a founding member 
of OPEC. Previously an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities 
such as coffee and cocoa, oil quickly came to dominate exports and government 
revenues. The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a long-running 
economic crisis, which saw inflation peak at 100% in 1996 and poverty rates 
rise to 66% in 1995[13] as (by 1998) per capita GDP fell to the same level 
as 1963, down a third from its 1978 peak.[14] The 1990s also saw Venezuela 
experience a major banking crisis in 1994. The recovery of oil prices after 
2001 boosted the Venezuelan economy and facilitated social spending. With 
social programs such as the Bolivarian Missions, Venezuela initially made 
progress in social development in the 2000s, particularly in areas such 
as health, education, and poverty. Many of the social policies pursued 
by Chávez and his administration were jump-started by the Millennium Development 
Goals, eight goals that Venezuela and 188 other nations agreed to in September 
2000.[177] The sustainability of the Bolivarian Missions has been questioned 
due to the Bolivarian state's overspending on public works and because 
the Chávez government did not save funds for future economic hardships 
like other OPEC nations; with economic issues and poverty rising as a result 
of their policies in the 2010s.[20][21][22][178][179] In 2003 the government 
of Hugo Chávez implemented currency controls after capital flight led to 
a devaluation of the currency. This led to the development of a parallel 
market of dollars in the subsequent years. The fallout of the 2008 global 
financial crisis saw a renewed economic downturn. Despite controversial 
data shared by the Venezuelan government showing that the country had halved 
malnutrition following one of the UN's Millennium Development Goals,[27][180] 
shortages of staple goods began to occur in Venezuela and malnutrition 
began to increase.[27] In early 2013, Venezuela devalued its currency due 
to growing shortages in the country.[181][182][183] The shortages included, 
and may still include, necessities such as toilet paper, milk, and flour,[184] 
Fears rose so high due to the toilet paper shortage that the government 
occupied a toilet paper factory, and continued further plans to nationalize 
other industrial aspects like food distribution.[185][186] Venezuela's 
bond ratings have also decreased multiple times in 2013 due to decisions 
by the president Nicolás Maduro. One of his decisions was to force stores 
and their warehouses to sell all of their products, which led to even more 
shortages in the future.[187] Venezuela's outlook has also been deemed 
negative by most bond-rating services.[188] Has been developed considerably 
in recent decades, particularly because of its favorable geographical position, 
the variety of landscapes, the richness of plant and wildlife, the artistic 
expressions and the privileged tropical climate of the country, which affords 
each region (especially the beaches) throughout the year. Margarita Island 
is one of the top tourist destinations for enjoyment and relaxation. It 
is an island with a modern infrastructure, bordered by beautiful beaches 
suitable for extreme sports, and features castles, fortresses and churches 
of great cultural value. The archipelago of Los Roques is formed by a group 
of islands and cays that make up one of the main tourist attractions of 
the country. With exotic pristine beaches. Morrocoy is a park, consisting 
of very small nearby islands to the mainland, which have grown rapidly 
as one of the biggest tourist attractions in the Caribbean. Canaima National 
Park is spread over 30,000 square kilometers to the border with Guayana 
Esequiba reclamation area now Guyana and Brazil, for its size is considered 
the world's sixth largest national park. About 65% of the park is occupied 
by rock plateaus called tepuis. These are a unique biological environment, 
also presenting a great geological interest. Its steep cliffs and waterfalls 
(including Angel Falls, which is the highest waterfall of the world, 1,002 
m) are spectacular sceneries. Beach in Los Roques Archipelago Pampatar 
in the Margarita Island Shortages in Venezuela have been prevalent following 
the enactment of price controls and other policies during the economic 
policy of the Hugo Chávez government.[189][190] Under the economic policy 
of the Nicolás Maduro government, greater shortages occurred due to the 
Venezuelan government's policy of withholding United States dollars from 
importers with price controls.[191] Shortages occur in regulated products, 
such as milk, various types of meat, chicken, coffee, rice, oil, precooked 
flour, butter prices, luxuries such as breast implants, and goods including 
basic necessities like toilet paper, personal hygiene products, and even 
medicine.[189][192][193] As a result of the shortages, Venezuelans must 
search for food, wait in lines for hours and sometimes settle without having 
certain products.[194][195] A drought, combined with a lack of planning 
and maintenance, has caused a hydroelectricity shortage. To deal with lack 
of power supply, in April 2016 the Maduro government announced rolling 
blackouts[196] and reduced the government workweek to only Monday and Tuesday.[197] 
Venezuela has the largest oil reserves, and the eighth largest natural 
gas reserves in the world, and consistently ranks among the top ten world 
crude oil producers.[198] Compared to the preceding year another 40.4% 
in crude oil reserves were proven in 2010, allowing Venezuela to surpass 
Saudi Arabia as the country with the largest reserves of this type.[199] 
The country's main petroleum deposits are located around and beneath Lake 
Maracaibo, the Gulf of Venezuela (both in Zulia), and in the Orinoco River 
basin (eastern Venezuela), where the country's largest reserve is located. 
Besides the largest conventional oil reserves and the second-largest natural 
gas reserves in the Western Hemisphere,[200] Venezuela has non-conventional 
oil deposits (extra-heavy crude oil, bitumen and tar sands) approximately 
equal to the world's reserves of conventional oil.[201] The electricity 
sector in Venezuela is one of the few to rely primarily on hydropower, 
and includes the Guri Dam, one of the largest in the world. In the first 
half of the 20th century, US oil companies were heavily involved in Venezuela, 
initially interested only in purchasing concessions.[202] In 1943 a new 
government introduced a 50/50 split in profits between the government and 
the oil industry. In 1960, with a newly installed democratic government, 
Hydrocarbons Minister Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso led the creation of OPEC, 
the consortium of oil-producing countries aiming to support the price of 
oil.[203] In 1973, Venezuela voted to nationalize its oil industry outright, 
effective 1 January 1976, with Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) taking over 
and presiding over a number of holding companies; in subsequent years, 
Venezuela built a vast refining and marketing system in the U.S. and Europe.[204] 
In the 1990s PDVSA became more independent from the government and presided 
over an apertura (opening) in which it invited in foreign investment. Under 
Hugo Chávez a 2001 law placed limits on foreign investment. The state oil 
company PDVSA played a key role in the December 2002 – February 2003 national 
strike which sought President Chávez' resignation. Managers and skilled 
highly paid technicians of PDVSA shut down the plants and left their posts, 
and by some reports sabotaged equipment, and petroleum production and refining 
by PDVSA almost ceased. Activities eventually were slowly restarted by 
returning and substitute oil workers. As a result of the strike, around 
40% of the company's workforce (around 18,000 workers) were dismissed for 
"dereliction of duty" during the strike.[205][206] Venezuela is connected 
to the world primarily via air (Venezuela's airports include the Simón 
Bolívar International Airport in Maiquetía, near Caracas and La Chinita 
International Airport near Maracaibo) and sea (with major sea ports at 
La Guaira, Maracaibo and Puerto Cabello). In the south and east the Amazon 
rainforest region has limited cross-border transport; in the west, there 
is a mountainous border of over 2,213 kilometres (1,375 mi) shared with 
Colombia. The Orinoco River is navigable by oceangoing vessels up to 400 
kilometres (250 mi) inland, and connects the major industrial city of Ciudad 
Guayana to the Atlantic Ocean. Venezuela has a limited national railway 
system, which has no active rail connections to other countries. The government 
of Hugo Chávez tried to invest in expanding it, but Venezuela's rail project 
is on hold due to Venezuela not being able to pay the $7.5 billion and 
owing China Railway nearly $500 million.[207] Several major cities have 
metro systems; the Caracas Metro has been operating since 1983. The Maracaibo 
Metro and Valencia Metro were opened more recently. Venezuela has a road 
network of nearly 100,000 kilometres (62,000 mi) in length, placing the 
country around 45th in the world;[208] around a third of roads are paved. 
Water supply and sanitation in Venezuela has been extended to an increasing 
number of people during the 2000s, although many poor remain without access 
to piped water. Service quality for those with access is mixed, with water 
often being supplied only on an intermittent basis and most wastewater 
not being treated. Non-revenue water is estimated to be high at 62%, compared 
to the regional average of 40%. Tap water is relatively inexpensive, because 
of a national tariff freeze imposed in 2003 and a policy not to recover 
capital costs. Investments are financed primarily by the national government, 
with little reliance on external financing. The sector remains centralized 
despite a decentralization process initiated in the 1990s that has now 
been stalled. Within the executive, sector policies are determined by the 
Ministry of Environment. The national water company HIDROVEN serves about 
80% of the population. The remainder is being served by five state water 
companies, the Corporación Venezolana de Guayana (CVG), a few municipalities 
and community-based organizations. Since the early 2000s the government 
encouraged the creation of about 7,500 Mesas Tecnicas del Agua, which have 
both a technical function and a political mobilization function.[209] Major 
investment projects include the restoration of the polluted Valencia Lake 
and of the Guaire river basin in Caracas (2005–2013).[210] Venezuela is 
among the most urbanized countries in Latin America;[11][12] the vast majority 
of Venezuelans live in the cities of the north, especially in the capital 
Caracas, which is also the largest city. About 93% of the population lives 
in urban areas in northern Venezuela; 73% live less than 100 kilometres 
(62 mi) from the coastline.[213] According to a study by sociologists of 
the Central University of Venezuela, over 1.5 million Venezuelans, or about 
4% to 6% of the country's population, left Venezuela following the Bolivarian 
Revolution.[214][215] Though almost half of Venezuela's land area lies 
south of the Orinoco, only 5% of Venezuelans live there. The largest and 
most important city south of the Orinoco is Ciudad Guayana, which is the 
sixth most populous conurbation.[216] Other major cities include Barquisimeto, 
Valencia, Maracay, Maracaibo, Mérida, San Cristóbal and Barcelona–Puerto 
la Cruz. The people of Venezuela come from a variety of ancestries. It 
is estimated that the majority of the population is of mestizo, or mixed, 
ethnic ancestry. Nevertheless, in the 2011 census, which Venezuelans were 
asked to identify themselves according to their customs and ancestry, the 
term mestizo was excluded from the answers. The majority claimed to be 
mestizo or white — 51.6% and 43.6%, respectively.[1] Practically half of 
the population claimed to be moreno, a term used throughout Ibero-America 
that in this case means "dark-skinned" or "brown-skinned", as opposed to 
having a lighter skin (this term connotes skin color or tone, rather than 
facial features or descent). Ethnic minorities in Venezuela consist of 
groups that descend mainly from African or indigenous peoples; 2.8% identified 
themselves as "black" and 0.7% as afrodescendiente (Afro-descendant), 2.6% 
claimed to belong to indigenous peoples, and 1.2% answered "other races".[1][1] 
Among indigenous people, 58% were Wayúu, 7% Warao, 5% Kariña, 4% Pemón, 
3% Piaroa, 3% Jivi, 3% Añu, 3% Cumanágoto, 2% Yukpa, 2% Chaima and 1% Yanomami; 
the remaining 9% consisted of other indigenous nations.[217] According 
to an autosomal DNA genetic study conducted in 2008 by the University of 
Brasília (UNB), the composition of Venezuela's population is 60.60% of 
European contribution, 23% of indigenous contribution, and 16.30% of African 
contribution.[218] During the colonial period and until after the Second 
World War, many of the European immigrants to Venezuela came from the Canary 
Islands,[219] which had a significant cultural impact on the cuisine and 
customs of Venezuela.[220][221][222] These influences on Venezuela has 
led to the nation being called the 8th island of the Canaries.[223][224] 
With the start of oil exploitation in the early 20th century, companies 
from the United States began establishing operations in Venezuela, bringing 
with them US citizens. Later, during and after the war, new waves of immigrants 
from other parts of Europe, the Middle East, and China began; many were 
encouraged by government-established immigration programs and lenient immigration 
policies.[225] During the 20th century, Venezuela, along with the rest 
of Latin America, received millions of immigrants from Europe.[226][227] 
This was especially true post-World War II, as a consequence of war-ridden 
Europe.[226][227][228] During the 1970s, while experiencing an oil-export 
boom, Venezuela received millions of immigrants from Ecuador, Colombia, 
and the Dominican Republic.[228] Due to the belief that this immigration 
influx depressed wages, some Venezuelans opposed European immigration.[228] 
The Venezuelan government, however, were actively recruiting immigrants 
from Eastern Europe to fill a need for engineers.[226] Millions of Colombians, 
as well as Middle Eastern and Haitian populations would continue immigrating 
to Venezuela into the early 21st century.[225] According to the World Refugee 
Survey 2008, published by the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, 
Venezuela hosted a population of refugee and asylum seekers from Colombia 
numbering 252,200 in 2007, and 10,600 new asylum seekers entered Venezuela 
in 2007.[229] Between 500,000 and one million illegal immigrants are estimated 
to be living in the country.[230] The total indigenous population of the 
country is estimated at about 500 thousand people (2.8% of the total), 
distributed among 40 indigenous peoples.[231] The Constitution recognizes 
the multi-ethnic, pluri-cultural, and multilingual character of the country 
and includes a chapter devoted to indigenous peoples' rights, which opened 
up spaces for their political inclusion at national and local level in 
1999. Most indigenous peoples are concentrated in eight states along Venezuela's 
borders with Brazil, Guyana, and Colombia, and the majority groups are 
the Wayuu (west), the Warao (east), the Yanomami (south), and the Pemon 
(southeast). Although the country is mostly monolingual Spanish, many languages 
are spoken in Venezuela. In addition to Spanish, the Constitution recognizes 
more than thirty indigenous languages, including Wayuu, Warao, Pemón, and 
many others for the official use of the indigenous peoples, mostly with 
few speakers – less than 1% of the total population. Immigrants, in addition 
to Spanish, speak their own languages. Arabic is spoken by Lebanese and 
Syrian colonies on Isla de Margarita, Maracaibo, Punto Fijo, Puerto la 
Cruz, El Tigre, Maracay, and Caracas. Portuguese is spoken not only by 
the Portuguese community in Santa Elena de Uairén but also by much of the 
population due to its proximity to Brazil. The German community speaks 
their native language, while the people of Colonia Tovar people speaks 
mostly an Alemannic dialect of German called coloniero. English is the 
most widely used foreign language in demand and is spoken by many professionals, 
academics, and members of the upper and middle classes as a result of oil 
exploration by foreign companies, in addition to its acceptance as a lingua 
franca. Culturally, English is common in southern towns like El Callao, 
for the English-speaking native influence evident in folk songs and calypso 
Venezuelan and French with English voices. Italian instruction is guaranteed 
by the presence of a constant number of schools and private institutions 
because the Italian government considered mandatory language teaching at 
school level. Other languages spoken by large communities in the country 
are Chinese and Galician, among others. Religion in Venezuela according 
to the 2011 census.[232] According to a 2011 poll (GIS XXI), 88 percent 
of the population is Christian, primarily Roman Catholic (71%), and the 
remaining 17 percent Protestant, primarily Evangelicals (in Latin America 
Protestants are usually called Evangelicos). The Venezuelans without religion 
are 8% (atheist 2% and agnostic or indifferent 6%), almost 3% of the population 
follow other religion (1% of them are of santeria).[232] There are small 
but influential Muslim, Buddhist, and Jewish communities. The Muslim community 
of more than 100,000 is concentrated among persons of Lebanese and Syrian 
descent living in Nueva Esparta State, Punto Fijo and the Caracas area. 
Buddhism in Venezuela is practiced by over 52,000 people. The Buddhist 
community is made up mainly of Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans. There are 
Buddhist centers in Caracas, Maracay, Mérida, Puerto Ordáz, San Felipe, 
and Valencia. The Jewish community numbers approximately 13,000 and is 
mainly concentrated in Caracas. Metropolitan Cathedral of Barquisimeto,

in Maturín The culture of Venezuela is a melting pot, which includes mainly 
three different families: The indigenous, African, and Spanish. The first 
two cultures were in turn differentiated according to the tribes. Acculturation 
and assimilation, typical of a cultural syncretism, caused an arrival at 
the current Venezuelan culture, similar in many respects to the rest of 
Latin America, although the natural environment means that there are important 
differences. The indigenous influence is limited to a few words of vocabulary 
and gastronomy and many place names. The African influence in the same 
way, in addition to musical instruments like the drum. The Spanish influence 
was predominant (due to the colonization process and the socioeconomic 
structure it created) and in particular came from the regions of Andalusia 
and Extremadura, the places of origin of most settlers in the Caribbean 
during the colonial era. An example of this includes buildings, music, 
the Catholic religion, and language. Spanish influences are evident in 
bullfights and certain features of gastronomy. Venezuela was also enriched 
by other streams of Indian and European origin in the 19th century, especially 
from France. In the latest stage in the major cities and regions oil of 
U.S. origin and manifestations of the new immigration of Spanish, Italian 
and Portuguese, increasing the already complex cultural mosaic. For example, 
from United States comes the influence of taste for baseball, US-style 
fast food, and current architectural constructions. Venezuelan art was 
initially dominated by religious motifs. However, in the late 19th century, 
artists began emphasizing historical and heroic representations of the 
country's struggle for independence.[233][234] This move was led by Martín 
Tovar y Tovar.[234][235] Modernism took over in the 20th century.[235] 
Notable Venezuelan artists include Arturo Michelena, Cristóbal Rojas, Armando 
Reverón, Manuel Cabré; the kinetic artists Jesús Soto, Gego and Carlos 
Cruz-Díez;[235] and contemporary artists as Marisol and Yucef Merhi.[236][237] 
Venezuelan literature originated soon after the Spanish conquest of the 
mostly pre-literate indigenous societies.[238] It was originally dominated 
by Spanish influences. Following the rise of political literature during 
the Venezuelan War of Independence, Venezuelan Romanticism, notably expounded 
by Juan Vicente González, emerged as the first important genre in the region. 
Although mainly focused on narrative writing, Venezuelan literature was 
advanced by poets such as Andrés Eloy Blanco and Fermín Toro. Major writers 
and novelists include Rómulo Gallegos, Teresa de la Parra, Arturo Uslar 
Pietri, Adriano González León, Miguel Otero Silva, and Mariano Picón Salas. 
The great poet and humanist Andrés Bello was also an educator and intellectual 
(He was also a childhood tutor and mentor of Simón Bolívar). Others, such 
as Laureano Vallenilla Lanz and José Gil Fortoul, contributed to Venezuelan 
Positivism. Indigenous musical styles of Venezuela are exemplified by the 
groups Un Sólo Pueblo and Serenata Guayanesa. The national musical instrument 
is the cuatro. Typical musical styles and pieces mainly emerged in and 
around the llanos region, including Alma Llanera (by Pedro Elías Gutiérrez 
and Rafael Bolívar Coronado), Florentino y el diablo (by Alberto Arvelo 
Torrealba), Concierto en la llanura by Juan Vicente Torrealba, and Caballo 
Viejo (by Simón Díaz). The Zulian gaita is also a very popular style, generally 
performed during Christmas. The national dance is the joropo.[239] Venezuela 
has always been a melting pot of cultures and this can be seen in the richness 
and variety of its musical styles and dances: calipso, bambuco, fulía, 
cantos de pilado de maíz, cantos de lavanderas, sebucán, and maremare.[240] 
Teresa Carreño was a world-famous 19th century piano virtuoso. In the last 
years, Classical Music has had great performances. The Simón Bolívar Youth 
Orchestra, under the baton of its principal conductor Gustavo Dudamel and 
José Antonio Abreu, has hosted a number of excellent presentations in many 
European concert halls, notably at the 2007 London Proms, and has received 
several honors. The orchestra is the pinnacle of El Sistema, a publicly 
financed voluntary sector music education program now being emulated in 
other countries. In the early 21st century, a movement known as "Movida 
Acústica Urbana" featured musicians trying to save some national traditions, 
creating their own songs but using traditional instruments.[241][242] Some 
groups in this tradition are Tambor Urbano,[243] Los Sinverguenzas, the 
C4Trio, and Orozco Jam.[244] Afro-Venezuelan musical traditions are most 
intimately related to the festivals of the "black folk saints" San Juan 
and San Benito. Specific songs are related to the different stages of the 
festival and of the procession, when the saints start their yearly paseo 
– stroll – through the community to dance with their people. The origins 
of baseball in Venezuela is unclear, although it is known that the sport 
was being played in the nation by the late 19th century.[245] In the early 
20th century, North American immigrants who came to Venezuela to work in 
the nation's oil industry helped to popularize the sport in Venezuela.[246] 
During the 1930s, baseball's popularity continued to rise in the country, 
leading to the foundation of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League 
in 1945, and the sport would soon become the nation's most popular.[247][248] 
The immense popularity of baseball in the country makes Venezuela a rarity 
among its South American neighbors—association football is the dominant 
sport in the continent.[246][248][249] However, football, as well as basketball, 
are among the more popular sports played in Venezuela.[250] Venezuela hosted 
the 2012 Basketball World Olympic Qualifying Tournament and the 2013 FIBA 
Basketball Americas Championship, which took place in Poliedro de Caracas. 
Although not as popular in Venezuela as the rest of South America, football, 
spearheaded by the Venezuela national football team is gaining popularity 
as well. The sport is also noted for having an increased focus during the 
World Cup.[250] According to the CONMEBOL alphabetical rotation policy 
established in 2011, Venezuela is scheduled to host the Copa América every 
40 years.[251] Venezuela is also home to Formula 1 driver, Pastor Maldonado.[252] 
At the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix, he claimed his first pole and victory and 
became the first and only Venezuelan to have done so in the history of 
Formula 1.[252] Maldonado has increased the reception of Formula 1 in Venezuela, 
helping to popularize the sport in the nation.[253] In the 2012 Summer 
Olympics, Venezuelan Rubén Limardo won a gold medal in fencing.[254] The 
Venezuelan cuisine, one of the most varied in the region, reflects the 
climatic contrasts and cultures coexisting in Venezuela. Among them are 
hallaca, pabellón criollo, arepas, pisca andina, tarkarí de chivo, jalea 
de mango, and fried camiguanas. Arepa Empanadas Cachapa Pabellón Reina 
Pepiada Pan de jamón, typical Venezuelan Christmas bread. Quesillo Torta 
negra, typical Venezuelan Christmas cake. Venezuela has been well documented 
for its elusive success in global beauty pageantry, headed by the renowned 
beauty queen maker Osmel Sousa raking in with 22 victorious titles to date. 
[255] Furthermore, Miss Venezuela is a closely followed event throughout 
the country, as well as in other competing nations where Venezuelan beauty 
pageants are often seen as the mainstream standard of pageantry. Overall, 
Venezuela has received the following crowns: Venezuela ranks first in the 
Global Beauties webpage list as the country with more international pageants 
titles won. It also has a Guinness World Record, after Dayana Mendoza, 
Miss Universe 2008 from Venezuela crowned Stefania Fernandez, also from 
Venezuela as Miss Universe 2009, marking the first time over 50 years in 
the competition that a country wins the title in two consecutive years.[256] 
Carlos Raúl Villanueva was the most important Venezuelan architect of the 
modern era; he designed the Central University of Venezuela, (a World Heritage 
Site) and its Aula Magna. Other notable architectural works include the 
Capitolio, the Baralt Theatre, the Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex, and 
the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge. The literacy rate for the adult population 
was already 91.1 by 1998.[257] In 2008, 95.2% of the adult population was 
literate.[258] Net primary school enrollment rate was at 91% in 2005.[258] 
Net secondary enrollment rate was at 63% in 2005.[258] Venezuela has a 
number of universities, of which the most prestigious are the Central University 
of Venezuela (UCV), founded in Caracas in 1721, the University of Zulia 
(LUZ) founded in 1891, the University of the Andes (ULA), founded in Mérida 
State in 1810, the Simón Bolívar University (USB), founded in Miranda State 
in 1967 and the University of the East (UDO), founded in Sucre State in 
1958. Currently, large numbers of Venezuelan graduates seek for a future 
elsewhere due to the country's troubled economy and heavy crime rate. In 
a study titled Venezolana Community Abroad. A New Method of Exile by Thomas 
Paez, Mercedes Vivas and Juan Rafael Pulido of the Central University of 
Venezuela, over 1.35 million Venezuelan college graduates had left the 
country since the beginning of the Bolivarian Revolution.[214][215] It 
is believed nearly 12% of Venezuelans live abroad with Ireland becoming 
a popular destination for students.[259] According to Claudio Bifano, president 
of the Venezuelan Academy of Physical, Mathematical and Natural Sciences, 
more than half of medical graduates in 2013 had left Venezuela.[260] Venezuela 
has a national universal health care system. The current government has 
created a program to expand access to health care known as Misión Barrio 
Adentro,[261][262] although its efficiency and work conditions have been 
criticized.[263][264][265] It has reported that many of the clinics were 
closed and as of December 2014, it was estimated that 80% of Barrio Adentro 
establishments were abandoned in Venezuela.[266][267] Infant mortality 
in Venezuela was 19 deaths per 1,000 births for 2014, lower than the South 
American average (by comparison, the U.S. figure was 6 deaths per 1,000 
births in 2013).[268] Child malnutrition (defined as stunting or wasting 
in children under age five) was 17%; Delta Amacuro and Amazonas had the 
nation's highest rates.[269] According to the United Nations, 32% of Venezuelans 
lacked adequate sanitation, primarily those living in rural areas.[270] 
Diseases ranging from typhoid, yellow fever, cholera, hepatitis A, hepatitis 
B, and hepatitis D were present in the country.[271] Obesity was prevalent 
in approximately 30% of the adult population in Venezuela.[268] Venezuela 
had a total of 150 plants for sewage treatment. However, 13% of the population 
lacked access to drinking water, but this number had been dropping.[272] 
During the economic crisis observed under President Maduro's presidency, 
medical professionals were forced to perform outdated treatments on patients.[273] 
To the people of Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela has been a neighbour and 
both countries have had a longstanding diplomatic relationship whereby 
an embassy was established as far back as 1987 if not earlier. Located 
on Victoria Avenue in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, the modest building 
has served as a home office to the visitors to the country of Trinidad 
and Tobago, where information on the country of Venezuela was sought by 
many a student and school teacher who needed to boost their knowledge of 
the culture and the language of Spain and Venezuela. According to Business 
Insider's edition of July 2015, Venezuela was seeking to re-establish diplomatic 
ties with the United States of America, "Maduro made the first move in 
March (2015) – around three months after Washington and Havana announced 
on 17 Dec they were seeking to restore diplomatic ties – by requesting 
a "direct channel of communication" with U.S. President Barack Obama and 
the State Department, said the official.[274] By virtue of its geographical 
location, Venezuela became one of the members of the Organisation of American 
States (OAS) on "April 30, 1948" when they signed the "CHARTER OF THE ORGANIZATION 
OF AMERICAN STATES (A-41)".[275] On 21 December 1951, the treaty was ratified 
by Venezuela "IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 145 OF THE CHARTER".[276] In looking 
at the treaty, one would note that there are three (3) parts with twenty 
two chapters in total to the Treaty of the OAS.[277] According to the OAS 
website. "Chapter XXI RATIFICATION AND ENTRY INTO FORCE, Article 141" the 
OAS Treaty or Charter "shall be registered with the Secretariat of the 
United Nations through the General Secretariat"[277] In accordance with 
"Chapter XIII THE INTER-AMERICAN COUNCIL FOR INTEGRAL DEVELOPMENT- Article 
94 – The purpose of the Inter-American Council for Integral Development 
is to promote cooperation among the American States for the purpose of 
achieving integral development and, in particular, helping to eliminate 
extreme poverty, in accordance with the standards of the Charter, especially 
those set forth in Chapter VII with respect to the economic, social, educational, 
cultural, scientific, and technological fields." [278] To a large extent 
over the years, the people of Trinidad and Tobago have benefited from the 
generosity of the Venezuelans, whether it was due to their innate ability 
to give and share or whether it was provided by the articles of the Treaty 
as a means to share and for that they are grateful. "The Summits of the 
Americas are institutionalized gatherings of the heads of state and government 
of the Western Hemisphere where leaders discuss common policy issues, affirm 
shared values and commit to concerted actions at the national and regional 
level to address continuing and new challenges faced in the Americas.[279] 
To date there have been seven Summits of the Americas. There have also 
been at least two Special Meetings which were held between 1996 and 2004. 
"At the Third Summit," which was held in Quebec, Canada in 2001 "leaders 
instructed their foreign ministers to prepare an Inter-American Democratic 
Charter which was adopted on September 11, 2001 in Lima".[279] The Fifth 
Summit of the Americas was held in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago in 
2009 was attended by Hugo Chávez on behalf of Venezuela. Also in attendance 
were Prime Minister Patrick Manning of Trinidad and Tobago and President 
Barack Obama of the United States of America. The Seventh Summit of the 
Americas was held in Panama City, Panama on 10–11 April 2015.[280] Peru 
will host the Eighth Summit of the Americas in 2018.[280] "In the democratic 
era, Venezuela has attempted to fulfill the principles of Simon Bolivar's 
ideals through a variety of means. It maintained active membership in the 
United Nations (UN) and its related agencies, OPEC, the Organization of 
American States (OAS) and its related entities, and a host of other world 
and hemispheric organizations. In all these forums, Venezuela consistently 
aligned itself with other democracies" Venezuela and the United States 
belong to a number of the same international organizations, including the 
related agencies of the UN such as the International Monetary Fund, World 
Bank, and World Trade Organization.[281] "The Betancourt Doctrine", named 
after one of the first presidents of Venezuela's democratic era, Rómulo 
Betancourt "whereby Venezuela refused to maintain diplomatic relations 
with governments formed as a result of military coups, was adhered to by 
both administrations (first two presidents of Venezuela's democratic era). 
Although the doctrine was much praised, it gradually isolated Venezuela 
as most other Latin American nations became dominated by nonelected regimes."[282]
