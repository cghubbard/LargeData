Edwin Henry Killian (November 12, 1876 – July 18, 1928), nicknamed "Twilight 
Ed,"[1] was a Major League Baseball pitcher primarily of the Detroit Tigers. 
Twice a 20-game winner (including a 25–13 season in 1907), Killian's career 
ERA of 2.38 is tied for 24th best in Major League Baseball history, ahead 
of pitchers Cy Young and Grover Cleveland Alexander.[2] Born in Racine, 
Wisconsin, Killian did not start his first game in the majors until he 
was age 26. He came up late in the 1903 season and was 3–4 for the Cleveland 
Naps. In January 1904, Killian was traded by the Naps with Jesse Stovall 
to the Detroit Tigers for Billy Lush. Killian pitched the rest of his major 
league career with the Tigers. In 1904, Killian had 32 complete games and 
a 2.44 ERA in 331 innings, but without support from the 7th place Tigers, 
Killian had the dubious distinction of losing 20 games in his first full 
season. As proof that his 1904 win-loss record was not indicative of his 
talents, Killian battled Cy Young in one of the most remarkable pitching 
duels in history on May 11, 1904. Young and Killian each pitched 14 scoreless 
innings, before the Red Sox scored a run in the 15th inning, winning 1–0.[3] 
In 1905, Killian turned things around, reducing his ERA to 2.27. He started 
37 games and completed 33. He wound up with a 23–14 record, the third best 
win total in the AL and 4th best in complete games. His eight shutouts 
in 1905 was tops in the American League. Killian started only 16 games 
in 1906 and finished 10–6, but 1907 saw Killian reach the high point of 
his career. That year, Killian started 41 games for the American League 
Champion Detroit team. He had a record of 25–13 and an ERA of 1.78–81 points 
lower than the league average ERA of 2.59. Killian's performance in 1907 
helped lead the Tigers to their first AL pennant and was one of the best 
pitching performances in the history of the Detroit Tigers. Caught in a 
close race at the end of the 1907 season with Connie Mack's Athletics, 
Killian pitched and won both games of a double-header to clinch the penant. 
Unfortunately, the Tigers' ace was worn out for the post-season and was 
only able to pitch 4 innings with no-decision in the 1907 World Series 
against the Cubs. After his workhorse performance in 1907, Killian never 
again pitched more than 180 innings, continuing to have a winning record 
in his three remaining years, but no longer having the stamina to pitch 
331 innings or start 41 games as he had in 1905 and 1907. Killian also 
holds the record for fewest home runs allowed, giving up only 9 in his 
entire career, an average of one home run every 178 innings. At one point, 
Killian pitched a record 1001 innings, spanning parts of five seasons (from 
September 19, 1903 until August 7, 1907), without allowing a home run.[3]
