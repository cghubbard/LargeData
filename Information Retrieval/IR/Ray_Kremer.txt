Remy Peter "Ray" Kremer (March 23, 1893 – February 8, 1965) was a professional 
baseball player. He was a pitcher over parts of ten seasons (1924–1933), 
all with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Kremer had a remarkable beginning to his 
big-league career. He posted an 18-10 record as a rookie in 1924, then 
followed that with seasons of 17-8, 20-6 and 19-8. He was third in the 
vote for the National League's most valuable player in 1926. The Pirates 
won a pair of pennants during that stretch. Kremer threw two complete games 
in the 1925 World Series against the Washington Senators, and after winning 
Game 6 with a six-hitter, Kremer was brought back for four innings of relief 
in Game 7 and ended up the winning pitcher in that game as well. He also 
made one start in the 1927 World Series, chosen to pitch Game 1 against 
a New York Yankees team thought by many to be the greatest baseball team 
of all time. He led the National League in ERA in both 1926 and 1927. Kremer 
put up some of the most impressive numbers of his career in 1930, leading 
the league in wins (20), games started (38) and innings pitched (276). 
For his career, he compiled an 143–85 record in 308 appearances, with a 
3.76 ERA and 516 strikeouts. Kremer's 143 wins with Pittsburgh rank him 
eighth in franchise history, his .627 winning percentage ranks seventh, 
and his 1,954 2⁄3 innings pitched rank tenth. He was born in Oakland, California,
