The Chunichi Shimbun (中日新聞, Chūnichi Shinbun?) is a Japanese daily "broadsheet" 
newspaper published in mostly Aichi Prefecture and neighboring regions 
by Chunichi Shimbun Co., Ltd (株式会社中日新聞社, Kabushiki-gaisha Chūnichi Shinbunsha?). 
The newspaper is dominant in its region, with a market penetration approaching 
60 percent of the population of Aichi Prefecture. The Chunichi Shimbun 
group also publishes the Tokyo Shimbun, the Chunichi Sports, and the Tokyo 
Chunichi Sports newspapers. The group’s combined circulation is more than 
4 million, meaning it ranks fourth in Japan behind the Yomiuri Shimbun, 
the Asahi Shimbun, and the Mainichi Shimbun. It is the owner of the Chunichi 
Dragons baseball team, and is also known as the main organizer of a famous 
international gymnastics event, the Chunichi Cup. The newspaper was formerly 
known as Nagoya Shimbun.[1] From 1936–1940 it owned the Japanese Baseball 
League team Nagoya Kinko.[1] The paper acquired the Chubu Nihon (now Chunichi 
Dragons) in 1946.[2] The group has thirteen foreign bureaus. They are in 
New York City, Washington, D.C., London, Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Cairo,
