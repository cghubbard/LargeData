Nobuhiko Matsunaka (松中 信彦, Matsunaka Nobuhiko?, born December 26, 1973 
in Yatsushiro, Kumamoto, Japan) is a former left fielder and designated 
hitter for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. He played in the 1996 Atlanta and 
2000 Sydney Olympics[1] as well as the 2006 World Baseball Classic, hitting 
cleanup in 1996 and 2006. Matsunaka was born in Yatsushiro, Kumamoto, and 
attended the local Yatsushiro First High School (currently Shugakukan High 
School). He joined Nippon Steel Corporation Kimitsu Works, a team in the 
Japanese industrial leagues, upon graduating high school in 1991. In 1996, 
22-year-old Matsunaka, then still a first baseman for Nippon Steel-Kimitsu, 
gathered national attention when he hit a game-tying grand slam in the 
finals of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics against Cuba as a member of the Japanese 
national team. He was picked in the second round of the 1996 amateur draft 
by the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks. Matsunaka made his debut at the ichigun (Japanese 
equivalent of "major league") level in 1997, his rookie season, as the 
starting first baseman and No. 7 hitter in a regular season game against 
the Seibu Lions on May 31. His first home run came more than a year later 
against Lions right-hander Fumiya Nishiguchi on September 5 1998. Matsunaka 
became the Hawks' starting first baseman in 1999 with the departure of 
Luis Lopez, hitting .268 with 23 home runs and 71 RBI and leading them 
to their first championship in 35 years as they won the league title as 
well as that year's Japan Series in five games over the Chunichi Dragons. 
His 23 homers were second to only Hiroki Kokubo on the Hawks. Matsunaka 
had a breakout year in 2000, hitting .312 with 33 homers and 106 RBI and 
winning the Pacific League Most Valuable Player award for the first time 
in his career.[2] However, while the Hawks won the league title and reached 
the Japan Series for the second straight year, they blew a commanding 2-0 
lead to the Yomiuri Giants and lost in six games. Matsunaka was a factor 
in this loss, going just 1-for-20 with one home run in the series. Matsunaka 
put up his second consecutive .300-30-100 season the following season 2001, 
hitting .334 with 36 home runs and 122 RBI. The Hawks had a particularly 
potent lineup that year, with Matsunaka, Kokubo (44), catcher Kenji Johjima 
(31), and second baseman Tadahito Iguchi (30) all hitting 30 or more home 
runs.[3] It marked the first time four players on the same team had ever 
hit 30 or more homers in the Pacific League, and the four were dubbed the 
"30-Homer Quartet". However, while the Hawks broke a franchise record by 
hitting 203 home runs as a team, they finished second to the Osaka Kintetsu 
Buffaloes in the pennant race, missing their third straight league title. 
Matsunaka struggled to adjust to the new strike zone that the NPB had decided 
to implement in the 2002 season, hitting a career-low .260 with 28 home 
runs. He hit his 100th career home run on May 3 off left-hander Itsuki 
Shoda in a game against the Nippon Ham Fighters. In 2003, Matsunaka bounced 
back from a disappointing previous year and hit .324 with 30 home runs 
and 123 RBI in the regular season,[4] overtaking his teammate Johjima in 
RBI in the last game of the season to lead the league in that category 
for the first time. He led the Hawks to another pennant win and their first 
Japan Series championship in four years over the Hanshin Tigers. Despite 
the absence of Kokubo, their longtime cleanup hitter, the Hawks collectively 
hit .297 (the highest team batting average in NPB history), with four hitters 
putting up 100 or more RBI (the "100-RBI Quartet"). The 2004 season was 
the finest of Matsunaka's eight-year professional career. He hit .358 with 
44 home runs[5] and 120 RBI, becoming the first player in Japanese professional 
baseball since Hiromitsu Ochiai (then of the Lotte Orions) in 1986 to lead 
the league in batting average, home runs and RBI in the same season (he 
was tied with Fernando Seguignol in home runs) and thus win Triple Crown 
honors.[6][7] Making the feat even more impressive was that Matsunaka also 
led the league in hits, on-base percentage, runs scored and total bases, 
becoming just the second player in NPB history to lead the league in the 
aforementioned seven categories. Following the season, Matsunaka was rewarded 
with the second MVP award of his career as well as the Best Nine and Golden 
Glove awards. However, while he led his team to the playoffs, the Hawks 
fell in five games to the Lions due in large part to an abysmal showing 
by Matsunaka, who went just 2-for-16 in five games in the series. In 2005, 
the following year, Matsunaka became the Hawks' everyday designated hitter 
due to recurring problems with his knees. He hit his 200th career home 
run against Chiba Lotte Marines submariner Shunsuke Watanabe on April 17 
and finished the year with a .315 batting average, 46 home runs and 121 
RBI, leading the league in home runs and RBI for the second straight season 
and becoming the first hitter in NPB history to record more than 120 RBI 
in three straight seasons.[8] However, the Hawks suffered yet another early 
playoff exit, this time falling in five games to the Marines. Again, Matsunaka 
faced most of the blame for the loss, hitting just 1-for-19 in the series. 
He signed a seven-year contract with the Hawks in the 2005 off-season, 
virtually ensuring that he would finish his career with the team.[9] Coming 
off a triumphant victory in the inaugural World Baseball Classic, Matsunaka 
hit .324 during the 2006 regular season and won his second batting title 
that year,[10] but his power fell substantially as he managed to hit only 
19 home runs with 76 RBI. It was during this season that he began to see 
significant playing time in the outfield, frequently seeing starts at left 
field from interleague play onwards. The Hawks finished third in the regular 
season, defeating the Lions in the first round of the playoffs but ultimately 
being swept by the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters in the second round (though 
Matsunaka went 7-for-18 with 7 RBI in the postseason). Despite his less 
impressive numbers, Matsunaka received his fourth consecutive (and fifth 
overall) Best Nine Award as an outfielder, making him only the third player 
after Akinobu Mayumi and Ochiai to receive the award at three different 
positions (he had won three as a first baseman and one as a designated 
hitter). The 2007 season proved to be a disappointing one for Matsunaka. 
Despite the high expectations placed upon the new trio of Matsunaka, Kokubo 
(who had returned to the Hawks after a stint with the Giants via free agency) 
and newly acquired Hitoshi Tamura that would comprise the middle of the 
order, all three missed significant playing time due to injuries. Matsunaka 
put up his worst numbers since 2002, hitting just .266 with 15 home runs 
and 68 RBI. Coming off of a rigorous off-season lower body training regimen, 
Matsunaka rebounded in 2008, hitting his 300th career home run against 
young Lions ace Hideaki Wakui on August 29 and playing all 144 games while 
batting .290 with 25 home runs and driving in 92 runs.[11] However, his 
personal accomplishments were offset by the Hawks' collapse in the second 
half of the season, a free-fall which culminated in a loss to the Tohoku 
Rakuten Golden Eagles in the last game of the regular season that brought 
their first last-place finish since the 1996 season.[12] Matsunaka was 
officially listed as an outfielder from the 2009 season onwards. He recorded 
his 1000th career RBI in the season opener against the Orix Buffaloes on 
April 3 and became only the 11th player in NPB history to record 100 career 
hit-batters on April 21 against the Fighters, hitting a pair of two-run 
homers in the same game.[13] He got the 1500th hit of his career on May 
6 against the Buffaloes, becoming the 100th player in NPB history to accomplish 
the feat. Matsunaka is a two-time Olympian, representing Japan in both 
the 1996 Athens and 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. He played an instrumental 
role in Japan's silver medal finish in 1996,[14] hitting five home runs 
and 16 RBI in the tournament[15] (his game-tying grand slam in the finals 
against Cuba was arguably his most noteworthy moment, even though Japan 
eventually lost the match 9-13). Matsunaka became one of the first baseball 
players to ever participate in the Olympic Games as a pro when he was chosen 
to the national team for the 2000 Sydney Olympics,[16] but Japan was defeated 
by South Korea in the bronze medal match and came up empty in their run 
for a medal. In 2006, Matsunaka was chosen to the national team for the 
third time, playing in the inaugural World Baseball Classic as Japan's 
starting left fielder and cleanup hitter.[17] He hit .433 in eight games, 
albeit with no home runs,[18] and was instrumental in leading Japan to 
the inaugural title. Matsunaka is a burly 183 cm (6 ft), 97 kg (214 lb) 
power hitter[19][20] who currently hits in either the 3-hole or the cleanup 
spot in the Hawks' lineup. It is often said that balls Matsunaka pulls 
are less likely to go foul because of his ability to stay inside the pitch, 
a testament to how adept he is in turning on inside pitches. He also strikes 
out very infrequently compared to other so-called power hitters. He struck 
out just 85 times when he hit 46 home runs (his career high) in 2005, 67 
times when he hit 44 homers in 2004 and 77 times when he hit 36 homers 
in 2001, never whiffing more than 91 times in a single season. Matsunaka 
has never been regarded as a particularly good fielder. Though he won the 
Pacific League Golden Glove award at first base in 2004, many thought that 
he was chosen over other candidates with better defensive reputations, 
such as Marines first baseman and three-time Golden Glove winner Kazuya 
Fukuura, largely on merit of his offensive production (Matsunaka led the 
league in all three Triple Crown categories that year). Matsunaka began 
to see substantial time in left field in interleague play during the 2006 
season. While he displayed limited range in the outfield, his throws were 
usually fairly accurate despite his weak throwing arm. He has since seen 
an increasing number of starts as the team's designated hitter due to a 
history of shoulder- and elbow-related injuries.[21] Bold indicates league
