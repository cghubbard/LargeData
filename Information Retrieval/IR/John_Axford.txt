John Berton Axford (born April 1, 1983), nicknamed "The Ax Man", is a Canadian 
professional baseball pitcher for the Oakland Athletics of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He previously pitched in MLB for the Milwaukee Brewers, 
St. Louis Cardinals, Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Colorado 
Rockies. Axford led the National League in saves in 2011, when he won the 
Rolaids Relief Man Award. Raised in Port Dover, Ontario, Axford attended 
Assumption College School in nearby Brantford. Because the school didn't 
have an interscholastic baseball program, he played for Port Dover Minor 
Baseball, Team Ontario and Team Canada. His combined four-year totals with 
the three clubs were a 37–12 record, a 1.88 earned run average (ERA), 278 
innings pitched, 432 strikeouts and 173 walks.[1] He was originally selected 
by the Seattle Mariners in the seventh round (219th overall) of the 2001 
Major League Baseball (MLB) draft,[2] but accepted an athletic scholarship 
to the University of Notre Dame instead.[3] He was inactive during his 
junior year after undergoing Tommy John surgery in December 2003.[1] Used 
as a starting pitcher in 26 of 36 games, his record in three seasons with 
the Fighting Irish was 14–6.[4] Despite losing his scholarship as a redshirt 
senior in 2005, he still earned a bachelor's degree in film, television 
and theatre.[3] Axford was selected by the Cincinnati Reds in the 42nd 
round (1,259th overall) of the 2005 MLB draft.[5] He spent the spring of 
2006, his one remaining year of collegiate athletic eligibility, at Canisius 
College where he went 3–8, with a 5.01 earned run average in fourteen starts.[4] 
After watching him in action with the Golden Griffins, the Reds declined 
to offer a contract. By that summer, he was pitching for the Melville Millionaires 
of the Western Major Baseball League. A nineteen-strikeout performance 
in a seven-inning contest caught the attention of the New York Yankees,[3] 
who signed him as a minor-league free agent on August 11, 2006.[6] His 
2007 campaign was divided between three Class A farm teams (Staten Island 
Yankees, Charleston RiverDogs and Tampa Yankees) and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
Yankees, where he appeared in only one game. A combined 1–4 in 27 games,[4] 
he was released by on December 14, 2007.[6] After spending the winter working 
as a cell phone salesman for Telus in the Toronto area,[3] he signed with 
the Milwaukee Brewers on March 4, 2008.[6] A 5–10 campaign with a 4.55 
ERA for the Brevard County Manatees was followed by an offseason employed 
as a bartender at an East Side Mario's in Hamilton, Ontario.[3] Used exclusively 
out of the bullpen in 2009, he improved to a combined 9–1 with the Manatees, 
Huntsville Stars and Nashville Sounds.[4] He was called up to the Brewers 
on September 7,[7] and made his major league debut eight nights later as 
the last Brewers pitcher in a 13–7 loss to the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley 
Field. He surrendered an earned run, a hit and three walks in one inning 
pitched.[8] Axford started 2010 in Nashville before being promoted by the 
Brewers on May 15.[9] With Trevor Hoffman struggling in save situations, 
Axford, despite having never been a closer in his career, was given the 
job. Axford became a big success in the role and gained popularity with 
Brewer fans as he sported a handlebar mustache in many of his early appearances, 
evoking memories of legendary reliever Rollie Fingers. Axford finished 
his first full season with an 8–2 record, a 2.48 ERA, pitched in 50 games, 
was 24 out of 27 in save attempts, and struck out 76 batters in 58 innings 
pitched. He was named a relief pitcher on Baseball America's 2010 All-Rookie 
Team.[10] Axford went into 2011 as the Brewers closer and struggled early, 
blowing two saves in the first two weeks of the season. He went on to convert 
every single save opportunity the rest of the way. In a game against the 
Chicago Cubs on July 27, Axford converted his 26th consecutive save opportunity, 
breaking Doug Jones's Brewers franchise record.[11] Axford was named DHL 
Delivery Man Award winner for the month of July 2011, in which he recorded 
11 saves with a 2.57 ERA.[11] On September 24, he set the Brewers franchise 
record for most saves in a single season, saving his 45th against the Florida 
Marlins. For the season he led the National League in saves (46), and was 
second in games finished (63), pitching 73 2⁄3 innings with 86 strikeouts 
and 59 hits while going 2–2 with a 1.95 ERA.[12] Axford was the first Brewers 
pitcher since Rollie Fingers to be a league leader in saves. He continued 
his success in the 2011 postseason, appearing in 6 playoff games and racking 
up 3 saves and a 1.29 ERA while striking out 9 batters in 7 innings pitched. 
Axford, however, blew his first save since the second week of the season 
in the decisive Game Five of the NLDS, but still got the win as the Brewers 
won in the 10th inning. On October 28 Axford was named the recipient of 
the 2011 Robert Goulet Memorial Mustached American of the Year Award by 
the American Mustache Institute.[13] Recognition of Axford's success in 
2011 continued into the offseason, where he was ninth overall in voting 
for the NL Cy Young Award and 17th overall for the NL MVP award. He was 
nominated for and won several awards recognizing his success, including 
the NL Rolaids Relief Man (given to the league's best closer), and the 
Canadian Tip O'Neill Award (presented annually to the Canadian player judged 
to have excelled in individual achievement and team contribution). He shared 
the award with Joey Votto, the third time the Tip O'Neill has been shared.[14] 
Axford began 2012 with six straight saves, extending a streak to 49 consecutive 
save opportunities converted. This was the fourth-longest streak in MLB 
history. The streak ended on May 11, 2012, in a game against the Chicago 
Cubs. As it turned out, Axford's wife began going into labor with the birth 
of his second child that night, and he was unavailable to comment after 
the game. Instead, he left a handwritten note for journalists in his locker.[15] 
On July 16, Axford gave up three runs in the top of the ninth to blow a 
2-0 lead. Axford, however, was able to regain his control and was reinstated 
as the Brewers closer in the second half of the season. He managed to rebound 
enough to finish the 2012 season with 35 saves, which was still good enough 
for 6th in the National League, with a 4.67 ERA, plus a new career high 
in strikeouts in a season, striking out 93 batters in 69 innings pitched, 
averaging 12 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched.[16] On September 16, Axford 
recorded his 100th career save against the New York Mets.[17] On January 
18, 2013, the Brewers announced they had avoided arbitration with Axford, 
signing him to a one-year contract worth $5 million.[18] He pitched for 
the Canadian national baseball team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic 
(WBC) before the season. In his first four appearances, he had an 0-2 record 
with 22.10 ERA and a blown save. He threw 98 miles per hour (158 km/h) 
during the WBC, but only 90 to 91 miles per hour (145 to 146 km/h) with 
the Brewers. The Brewers replaced Axford as their closer with Jim Henderson.[19] 
He had a 4.45 ERA in 62 games for Milwaukee.[20] On August 30, 2013, the 
Brewers traded Axford to the St. Louis Cardinals for a player to be named 
later, who was later identified as Michael Blazek.[20] Cardinals' coaches 
informed Axford that he was tipping his pitches.[21] With the Cardinals, 
he worked with catcher Yadier Molina to fix mechanical flaws the Cardinals' 
coaching staff diagnosed.[19][20] Axford completed the season with a 1.74 
ERA in his last 13 regular-season games, and a 1.59 ERA during the 2013 
postseason, including 2 1⁄3 innings without allowing a run during the 2013 
World Series.[20] After the season, the Cardinals opted not to tender Axford 
a contract for the 2014 season, making him a free agent.[22] On December 
19, 2013, Axford signed a one-year, $4.5 million contract with the Cleveland 
Indians, who announced he would serve as their closer.[19] Despite 9 saves 
in April, Axford struggled in the closer role and lost the job to a closer-by-committee 
composed of Cody Allen, Bryan Shaw, Scott Atchison and Marc Rzepczynski 
in May.[23][24] Axford was claimed off waivers by the Pittsburgh Pirates 
on August 14, 2014.[25][26] He was designated for assignment on October 
25, 2014, and removed from the 40-man roster. He elected to become a free 
agent on November 3. Axford signed a minor league contract with the Colorado 
Rockies on January 30, 2015.[27] He was added to the 40-man roster on March 
1, when Tyler Chatwood was placed on the 60-day disabled list.[28] After 
struggles from LaTroy Hawkins, setup man Adam Ottavino was appointed as 
the Rockies closer. When Ottavino tore his UCL and needed Tommy John surgery, 
Axford was named the closer for Colorado. Axford was designated for assignment 
by the Rockies after the season.[29] On December 11, 2015, Axford signed 
a two-year, $10 million contract with the Oakland Athletics.[30] When Axford 
first entered the majors as the Brewers closer, he relied heavily (almost 
exclusively) on his power fastball, which is generally thrown around 96–98 
MPH, but can reach as high as 100 MPH. Because of his height, the pitch 
is delivered on a downward plane, and is thrown with a peculiar arm snapping 
motion. Since then, his breaking pitches have become nearly as dominant 
as his fastball, and he now regularly throws a very good curveball at 79–80 
MPH with a sharp 12 to 6 break, as well as an 83–86 MPH slider with a late, 
sharp break. Axford received a bachelor's degree from Notre Dame in film 
and television.[31] An avid film fan, Axford correctly predicted 14 of 
the 15 winners of the 2013 Oscar awards, and all eighteen winners of the 
2014 Oscar awards via his Twitter account.[32] Selecting winners in all 
24 categories of the 2015 Oscar awards, Axford successfully chose 17 winners.[33]
