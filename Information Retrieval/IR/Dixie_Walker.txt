Fred E. "Dixie" Walker (September 24, 1910 – May 17, 1982) was an outfielder, 
primarily a right fielder, in Major League Baseball, playing for the New 
York Yankees (1931, 1933–36), Chicago White Sox (1936–37), Detroit Tigers 
(1938–39), Brooklyn Dodgers (1939–47), and Pittsburgh Pirates (1948–49).[1] 
In 11 years in the National League, Walker posted a .310 batting average 
(and in 9 years in the American League, a .295),[1] with 105 total home 
runs and 1,023 RBIs in 1,905 games.[1] Walker's popularity with the Ebbets 
Field fans in the 1940s brought him the nickname "The People's Cherce" 
(so-called, and spelled, because "Choice" in the "Brooklynese" of the mid-20th 
century frequently was pronounced that way).[2] He was an All-Star in five 
consecutive years (1943–47) and the 1944 National League batting champion.[2] 
Walker may be best known for his reluctance to play on the same team as 
Jackie Robinson in 1947.[2] Born on September 24, 1910, in Villa Rica, 
Georgia,[1] Walker was the scion of a baseball family.[3][4][5] His father, 
Ewart Walker (the original "Dixie Walker"), was a pitcher for the Washington 
Senators (1909–12); an uncle, Ernie Walker, was an outfielder for the St. 
Louis Browns (1913–15);[4] and his younger brother, Harry "the Hat" Walker, 
also an outfielder, played for four National League teams between 1940 
and 1955 and managed the St. Louis Cardinals (1955), Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1965–67) and Houston Astros (1968–72).[3][5] All four Walkers batted left-handed 
and threw right-handed.[1][3][4][5] Walker originally came up to the major 
leagues with the New York Yankees, and was considered an heir to Babe Ruth 
as the team's left fielder. After playing with the Yankees in 1931, and 
again from 1933 to 1936. After stints with the Chicago White Sox and Detroit 
Tigers, Walker blossomed into a star with the Brooklyn Dodgers, with whom 
he played from 1939 to 1947. He was a five time All Star, being selected 
in every year from 1943 to 1947. In addition, he was the National League's 
batting champion in 1944, with his average of .357 besting runner up Stan 
Musial's .347. In addition, Walker was the 1945 National League Runs batted 
In champion, with his total of 124 topping teammate Tommy Holmes's 117. 
Walker vocally opposed the participation of black baseball players regardless 
of their skill. He suggested he would not play for the Dodgers if a black 
baseball player were permitted on the team.[6] After the 1947 season, Walker 
was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates, for whom he played two seasons before 
retiring in 1949. The Pirates released Walker after the 1949 season, and 
he began a managing and coaching career as manager of the minor league 
Atlanta Crackers. In his first year as manager, they won the Southern Association 
pennant. He then led them to finishes of sixth and second. Walker coached 
with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1953, but left partway through the season 
to manage the Cardinals' Houston team in the Texas League. He managed Houston 
through 1954, after which he managed in the International League, first 
with the Rochester Red Wings (1955-1956), and then with the Toronto Maple 
Leafs (1957 to 1959). The Milwaukee Braves made Walker a scout, and he 
worked in this position until 1963, when he joined the team's coaching 
staff. When the Braves relocated to Atlanta in 1966, Walker was their chief 
scout for the Southeastern United States. In 1968 Walker joined the Dodgers 
as hitting coach, and he held this position until 1974. From 1974 to 1976 
he was a coach for the Dodgers' minor league system. In his 2002 book The 
Era, Roger Kahn wrote that Walker admitted to starting a Dodgers' player 
petition in 1947, in which the signers opposed the integration of baseball. 
In an interview with Kahn, Walker stated that he had nothing against Robinson 
specifically or African-Americans generally, but that he had been warned 
that his Birmingham business interests would suffer if he played baseball 
with black men. According to Kahn, Walker referred to the petition and 
his request to be traded from the Dodgers after the 1947 season as "the 
stupidest thing he’d ever done". In addition, Walker asked that if Kahn 
ever had the opportunity, Kahn write that Walker was sorry and apologized 
for his actions.[7] Walker died of colon cancer in Birmingham on May 17, 
1982, and was buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Birmingham.[8] In 1936 Walker 
married Estelle Shea. They were the parents of daughters Mary Ann and Susan,
