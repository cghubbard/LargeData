Butler is a city and the county seat of Butler County in the U.S. state 
of Pennsylvania.[2] It is located 35 miles (56 km) north of Pittsburgh 
and part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. As of the 2010 census, the 
city population was 13,757.[3] Butler was named the 7th best small town 
in America by Smithsonian magazine in May 2012.[4] Butler was named for 
Maj. Gen. Richard Butler,[5] who fell at the Battle of the Wabash, also 
known as St. Clair's Defeat, in western Ohio in 1791. In 1803 John and 
Samuel Cunningham became the first settlers in the village of Butler. After 
settling in Butler, the two brothers laid out the community by drawing 
up plots of land for more incoming settlers.[5] By 1817, the community 
was incorporated into a borough.[5] The first settlers were of Irish or 
Scottish descent and were driving westward from Connecticut. In 1802 the 
German immigrants began arriving, with Detmar Basse settling in Jackson 
Township in 1802 and founding Zelienople the following year. After George 
Rapp arrived in 1805 and founded Harmony, larger numbers of settlers followed. 
John A. Roebling settled Saxonburg in 1832, by which time most of the county 
was filled with German settlers. Throughout most of its history, the city 
of Butler has been a major manufacturing and industrial center. In 1902, 
the Standard Steel Car Company opened one of its largest railcar manufacturing 
facilities in Butler. It was here that some of the first all-steel rail 
cars were built. Diamond Jim Brady, the legendary financier, gourmand and 
gemophile, got his start here in 1902 when he established the Standard 
Steel Car Company, which merged with the Pullman Palace Car Company in 
1934 to create Pullman-Standard, a monopoly that was eventually broken 
by the government. About 2,500 workers produced 60 steel-bed railroad cars 
per day in 1902. Eastern European immigrants from Eastern Europe were attracted 
to the area in the early 20th century by the reliable jobs which sometimes 
included rent-free company housing. The company constructed a baseball 
park which was the home of a New York Yankees farm team. It made artillery 
and naval shells during World War II.[6] The Pullman-Standard plant closed 
in 1982, and was demolished in 2005. The site is now occupied by a strip 
mall, as well as the new Butler Transit Authority intermodal facility. 
In 2011 the BTA moved a covered hopper railcar to the bus terminal in recognition 
of the former Pullman-Standard plant. The car was built at the facility 
in 1974.[7] The American Austin Car Company (1929–41) was also headquartered 
in the borough. Later the firm changed its name to American Bantam Car 
Company. Bantam was an early producer of small fuel-efficient vehicles 
through the 1930s. The modern Jeep was created by American Bantam and the 
first prototypes were manufactured at the Butler facility. Big military 
contracts eventually went to Willys and Ford, while the Bantam factory 
had failed by World War II. Today, a monument in the plaza across from 
the courthouse commemorates Bantam's creation of the Jeep. Butler is home 
to one of the early Ford dealerships, established in 1918 and still extant.[8] 
The Rainbow Rubber Company, which in the late 1930s made precise "Rubrtoy" 
replicas of Oldsmobiles along with many other rubber toys was also located 
in Butler.[9] In the 1950s, Butler became one of the first cities to install 
bells at crosswalks, a common practice today. The city was linked to Pittsburgh 
via Mars, Pennsylvania, in 1907 by the Pittsburgh and Butler Street Railway, 
and to Evans City in 1908 by the Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle 
Railway, both interurban trolley lines. The Mars route closed in April 
1931, followed by the Evans City line on August 15, 1931, with the trolleys 
replaced by buses. Since the 1970s the borough's economy has changed drastically. 
Manufacturing has declined and good paying jobs are much rarer.[6] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.7 square 
miles (7.0 km2), all land. The Connoquenessing Creek, which was ranked 
the second most polluted waterway in the U.S. in 2000, flows through the
