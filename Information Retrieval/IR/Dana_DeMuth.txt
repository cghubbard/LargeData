Dana Andrew DeMuth (born May 30, 1956) is an umpire in Major League Baseball. 
DeMuth advanced through the minor leagues to the Triple-A Pacific Coast 
League before joining the National League staff full-time in 1985. He continued 
umpiring in the National League until the umpiring staffs of the American 
and National Leagues merged in 2000. He has been a crew chief since 1999. 
DeMuth has worn the uniform number 32 throughout his career. His postseason 
assignments include 10 Division Series (1996, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2008, 2009, 
2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015), 5 League Championship Series (1991, 1995, 
2000, 2002 and 2007), and 5 World Series (1993, 1998, 2001, 2009 and 2013). 
He also umpired in the All-Star Game in 1990, 2001, and 2009, working behind 
the plate for the second and third contests, and worked the 2009 World 
Baseball Classic.[1] DeMuth was the home plate umpire for Game 6 of the 
1993 World Series; a game memorable for Joe Carter's series-ending home 
run in the bottom of the ninth inning. DeMuth was the third base umpire 
for the game between the San Francisco Giants and the San Diego Padres 
on August 4, 2007. In the top of the second inning at San Diego, Barry 
Bonds of the Giants hit his 755th career home run off Clay Hensley, tying 
Hank Aaron for first all-time.[2] DeMuth was the home plate umpire for 
the game between the San Francisco Giants and the New York Yankees on September 
20, 2013. In the bottom of the seventh inning, Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees 
hit his 24th career grand slam off George Kontos, passing Lou Gehrig for 
first all-time. DeMuth was the second base umpire for Game 1 of the 2013 
World Series and in the bottom of the first inning called Boston second 
baseman Dustin Pedroia out at second after thinking St. Louis shortstop 
Pete Kozma caught the ball and was grabbing it from his glove with his 
free hand, but, after a huddle, the umpires correctly ruled that the ball 
bounced off the tip of Kozma's glove and ruled Pedroia safe at second, 
loading the bases for Mike Napoli who then hit a 3-run double. DeMuth was 
the home plate umpire for a no-hitter pitched by Jake Arrieta between the 
Chicago Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds on April 21, 2016. This was Arrieta's
