League Park and Cleveland Stadium from 1936–1946. League Park was a baseball 
park located in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. It is situated at the northeast 
corner of E. 66th Street and Lexington Avenue in the Hough neighborhood. 
It was built in 1891 as a wood structure and rebuilt using concrete and 
steel in 1910. The park was home to a number of professional sports teams, 
most notably the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball. League Park 
was first home to the Cleveland Spiders of the National League from 1891 
to 1899 and of the Cleveland Lake Shores of the Western League, the minor 
league predecessor to the Indians, in 1900. In the late 1940s, the park 
was also the home field of the Cleveland Buckeyes of the Negro American 
League. In addition to baseball, League Park was also used for American 
football, serving as the home field for several successive teams in the 
Ohio League and early National Football League (NFL) during the 1920s and 
1930s, as well as for college football. Most notably, the Cleveland Rams 
of the NFL played at League Park in 1937 and for much of the early 1940s. 
Later in the 1940s, the Cleveland Browns used League Park as a practice 
field. The Western Reserve Red Cats, present day Case Western Reserve University, 
played a majority of homes games at League Park from 1929–1941, and all 
home games after joining the Mid-American Conference from 1947–1949.[2] 
Western Reserve played many of its big-time college football games at League 
Park, including against the Ohio State Buckeyes,[3] Pittsburgh Panthers,[4] 
West Virginia Mountaineers,[5] and Cincinnati Bearcats.[2] Locally, Western 
Reserve Red Cats and Case Tech Rough Riders often showcased their annual 
Thanksgiving Day rivalry game against one another,[6] as well as playing 
other Big Four Conference games against John Carroll Blue Streaks and Baldwin-Wallace 
Yellow Jackets. Although Cleveland Stadium opened in 1932 and had a much 
larger seating capacity and better access by car, League Park continued 
to be used by the Indians through the 1946 season, mainly for weekday games. 
Weekend and other games expecting a larger crowd were held at Cleveland 
Stadium. Most of the League Park structure was demolished in 1951, although 
some remnants still remain, including the original ticket office built 
in 1909. After extensive renovation, the site was rededicated on August 
23, 2014, as the Baseball Heritage Museum and outdoor recreational baseball 
facility.[7] League Park was opened on May 1, 1891, with 9,000 wooden seats.[8] 
The National League's Cleveland Spiders played there until going out of 
business after a disastrous 20–134 season in 1899 due to having their best 
players stripped from their roster by an unscrupulous owner. They were 
replaced the very next year by the Cleveland Lake Shores, which was initially 
a minor league team. In 1901, the renamed Cleveland Indians were a charter 
member in the new American League, which became a major league. The park 
was rebuilt for the 1910 season as a concrete-and-steel stadium—one of 
two to open that year in the American League, the other being Comiskey 
Park. The new park had more than double the seating capacity of its predecessor. 
In 1916, new team owner "Sunny Jim" Dunn renamed the park Dunn Field. The 
Indians hosted games four through seven of the 1920 World Series at Dunn 
Field. When Dunn died in 1922, his wife inherited the ballpark and the 
team. When Dunn's widow, by then known as Mrs. George Pross, sold the franchise 
in 1927 for $1 million to a group headed by Alva Bradley the name reverted 
to the more prosaic "League Park" (there were a number of professional 
teams' parks generically called "League Park" at the time).[9] From July 
1932 through the 1933 season, the Indians played at the new and far larger 
Municipal Stadium. However, the players and fans complained about the huge 
outfield, which reduced the number of home runs. Moreover, as the Great 
Depression worsened, attendance at the much larger facility plummeted.[10] 
In 1934 the Indians moved most of their games back to League Park. In 1936, 
the Indians began splitting their schedule between the two parks, playing 
Sunday and holiday games at Cleveland Stadium during the summer and the 
remainder at League Park. Beginning in 1938, they also played selected 
important games downtown at Cleveland Stadium. Lights were never installed 
at League Park, and thus no major league night games were played there. 
However, at least one professional night game was played on July 27, 1931, 
between the Homestead Grays and the House of David, who borrowed the portable 
lighting system used by the Kansas City Monarchs. By 1940, the Indians 
played most of their home schedule at Municipal Stadium, abandoning League 
Park entirely after the 1946 season. League Park became the last stadium 
used in Major League Baseball never to install permanent lights. After 
the demise of the Negro American League Cleveland Buckeyes following the 
1950 season, League Park was no longer used as a regular sports venue. 
Most of the structure was demolished the next year. The Cleveland Browns 
football team would continue to use the aging facility as a practice field 
until the late 1960s. When it originally opened in 1891, it had 9,000 wooden 
seats.[8] A single deck grandstand was behind homeplate, a covered pavilion 
was along the first base line, and bleachers were located at various other 
places in the park. The ballpark was shoehorned to fit into the Cleveland 
street grid, which contorted the dimensions into a rather odd rectangular 
shape by modern standards. The fence in left field was 385 feet (117 m), 
a tremendous 460 feet (140 m) away in center, and a short 290 feet (88 m) 
down the right field foul line.[11] However, batters had to hit the ball 
over a 40-foot (12 m) fence to get a home run (by comparison, the Green 
Monster at Fenway Park is 37 feet (11 m) high).[12] It was essentially 
rebuilt prior to the 1910 season, with concrete and steel double-decker 
grandstands, expanding the seating capacity to 21,414. The design work 
was completed by Osborn Architects & Engineers, a local architecture firm 
that would go on to design several iconic ballparks over the next three 
years, including Comiskey Park, the Polo Grounds, Tiger Stadium, and Fenway 
Park. The front edge of the upper and lower decks were vertically aligned, 
bringing the up-front rows in the upper deck closer to the action, but 
those in back could not see much of foul territory. The fence was rejiggered, 
bringing the left field fence in 10 feet closer (375 feet (114 m)) and 
center field fence in 40 feet (420 feet (130 m)); the right field fence 
remained at 290 feet (88 m).[11] Batters still had to surmount a 40-foot 
(12 m) fence to hit a home run (by comparison, the Green Monster at Fenway 
Park is three feet shorter at 37 feet (11 m) high).[12] The fence in left 
field was only five feet tall, but batters had to hit the ball 375 feet 
(114 m) down the line to hit a home run, and it was fully 460 feet (140 m) 
to the scoreboard in the deepest part of center field. The diamond, situated 
in the northwest corner of the block, was slightly tilted counterclockwise, 
making right field not quite as easy a target as Baker Bowl's right field 
(which had a 60-foot (18 m) wall), for example. Today the site is a public 
park. A small section of the exterior brick facade (along the first-base 
side) still stands, as well as the old ticket office behind what was the 
right field corner. The last remnant of the grandstand, crumbling and presumably 
unsafe, was taken down ca. 2002 as part of a renovation process to the 
decaying playground. On February 7, 2011, the Cleveland City Council approved 
a plan to restore the ticket house and remaining bleacher wall, as well 
as build a new diamond on the site of the old one.[13][14] On October 27, 
2012, city leaders including Mayor Frank G. Jackson took part in the groundbreaking 
of the League Park restoration. The project included a museum, a restoration 
of the ball field, and a community park featuring pavilions and walking 
trails.[15] The community park was dedicated in September 2013 as the Fannie 
M. Lewis Community Park at League Park.[16] Lewis was a city councilwoman 
who encouraged League Park's restoration.[16] Restoration was completed 
in 2014, and League Park reopened August 23 of that year.[7] As part of 
the renovation, the Baseball Heritage Museum (housing artifacts from baseball 
history as well as many specifically from the history of League Park) was 
relocated from downtown Cleveland to the restored ticket house.[7][17] 
Some historic events that took place at League Park include the following:
