The Marianao baseball club played in the Cuban Professional League between 
the 1922–1923 and 1960–1961 seasons. The club represented the populous 
town of Marianao in Havana and played their games at La Tropicana Stadium, 
official site of the league.[1] According to some baseball historians, 
the Elefantes de Marianao (Marianao Elephants) was the first nickname used 
by the team.[2] Although it is a little studied topic, the 1923-24 Billiken 
baseball card set[3] includes pictures 15 cards each for each team that 
participated in the Cuban league during that season: Almendares, Habana, 
Santa Clara and Marianao. Indeed, Marianao players are wearing a uniform 
that shows the head of a white elephant on dark background.[2] At some 
point, the team wore gray uniforms and was recognized as the Marianao Frailes 
Grises (Grey Monks),[2] probably a nickname based on the color of the robes 
of the Dominican and Augustinian monks that founded Marianao in 1719.[4] 
Then, in 1948 the franchise was renamed as the Tigres de Marianao (Marianao 
Tigers), as they are usually cited, and also used a new uniform. Their 
flannels had black and orange piping with matching socks, perhaps recalling 
also those of its emblem, the tiger.[5] The team contended until the 1960–1961 
period, during what turned out to be the Cuban League's final season.[6] 
The Marianao squad participated in 27 Cuban league seasons, finishing in 
first place four times, second place six times, third place seven times, 
and in fourth place a league record ten times. The team posted a 729-861 
record in 1,590 games for a .458 winning percentage, which was the worst 
mark of the four Cuban league teams to play over 1,000 games.[6] Marianao, 
managed by Merito Acosta, won its first title in the 1922–1923 season, 
to become the only team after Habana to win the league championship in 
its inaugural season. They earned its second championship in the 1936–1937 
campaign, managed by Martin Dihigo, and clinched consecutive titles in 
the 1956–1957 and 1957–1958 seasons, guided by Napoleón Reyes. The latter 
two seasons they won the Caribbean Series, the only Series where they participated, 
becoming also the first team to win twice in the event's history.[6] Following 
the 1959 Cuban Revolution, political tensions rose with the Fidel Castro 
government. In March 1961, one month after the regular Cuban baseball season 
ended, the regime decreed the abolition of professional baseball in Cuba.[6] 
During the 1943–1944 season, the Marianao team became part of three rare 
occurrences in Cuban baseball history. On December 2, 1943, Ramón Roger 
of the Elefantes de Cienfuegos pitched 11 scoreless innings against them 
in one game that went 20 innings and lasted four hours and 25 minutes, 
the longest game ever played in Cuban baseball history. Roger was credited 
with the victory, 6–5. Meanwhile, Luis Tiant Sr. blanked Cienfuegos for 
14 innings, but was victimized by an error by shortstop Oral (Mickey) Burnette 
and suffered a heartbreaking loss.[7] A few days later on December 11, 
Habana pitcher Manuel García hurled a no-hit, no-run game against Marianao 
at La Tropicana Stadium. It turned in to be the first no-hitter pitched 
at La Tropicana since its opening in 1930. Also in the same game, the Marianao 
infield executed the first triple play at the La Tropical grounds.[6] [6]
