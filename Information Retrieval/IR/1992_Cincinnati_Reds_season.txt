The 1992 Cincinnati Reds season saw the Reds finish in second place in 
the National League West with a record of 92 wins and 70 losses. This was 
the final season in which the Reds donned the pullover jerseys and sans-a-belt 
pants uniform style (the Reds being the only professional team still wearing 
them). Following this season they switched back to a traditional baseball 
uniform.[1] Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played;
