Major League Baseball is the highest level of play in North American professional 
baseball, and is the organization that operates the National League and 
the American League. In 2000, the two leagues were officially disbanded 
as separate legal entities, and all of their rights and functions were 
consolidated in the commissioner's office.[1] Since that time, Major League 
Baseball has operated as a single league, and constitutes one of the major 
professional sports leagues of the United States. It is composed of 30 
teams.[2] Each team in the league has a manager, who is responsible for 
team strategy and leadership on and off the field.[3] Assisted by various 
coaches, the manager sets the line-up and starting pitcher before each 
game, and makes substitutions throughout the game. In early baseball history, 
it was not uncommon for players to fill multiple roles as player-managers; 
specifically, they managed the team while still being signed to play for 
the club.[4] The last player-manager in Major League Baseball was Pete 
Rose, who began managing the Cincinnati Reds in 1984.[5] Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim manager Mike Scioscia is currently the longest-tenured manager 
with the same team in Major League Baseball, having led the Angels since 
2000. The longest-tenured manager with the same team in the National League 
is Bruce Bochy, who has led the San Francisco Giants since 2006. The Miami 
Marlins, Seattle Mariners, San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Washington 
Nationals will all begin the 2016 season with new managers: respectively, 
Don Mattingly, Scott Servais, Andy Green, Dave Roberts, and Dusty Baker. 
Additionally, the Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee Brewers will retain 
managers who had been midseason replacement managers during the 2015 season: 
Pete Mackanin and Craig Counsell. Connie Mack holds the Major League Baseball 
record for most games won as a manager, with 3,731, and most managed with 
7,755. Bruce Bochy has the most wins among active managers, with 1,618, 
and games managed, with 3,222, as of the end of the 2013 season.[5] The 
all-time leaders in championships won in the World Series era (1903–present) 
are Joe McCarthy and Casey Stengel, who each won seven championships with 
the New York Yankees.[5] The Atlanta Braves National League franchise originated 
in Boston, Massachusetts in 1871. The team has employed 45 managers, who 
have led the team in three different cities: Boston (1871–1952), Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin (1953–1965), and Atlanta (1966–present).[6] The first manager 
was Harry Wright. The longest-tenured manager is Bobby Cox, who retired 
at the end of the 2010 season.[7] Cox served as skipper of the Braves for 
20 consecutive seasons (1990–2010),[8] and holds the major league record 
for managerial ejections,[9] with 151.[10] Cox' win–loss record was 2,058–1,638 
with the Braves (he previously managed the Toronto Blue Jays).[11] He won 
four Manager of the Year Awards (1985, 1991, 2004–2005)[12] and led the 
Braves to 14 consecutive division titles (3 in the National League West 
and 11 in the East; 1991–2005 excluding the 1994 strike-shortened season), 
winning one World Series in 1995.[6] Fredi González succeeded Cox as manager. 
Gonzalez was fired on May 17 2016.[13]On May 17, 2016, the Atlanta Braves 
named Snitker as their interim manager. On October 11, 2016, the Braves 
named Snitker as their full-time manager for the 2017 season.[14] The Marlins 
franchise entered the National League in 1993 as an expansion team, and 
was known as the Florida Marlins until 2011. The franchise's first manager 
was Rene Lachemann, who accumulated 285 losses during his four-season tenure. 
Jim Leyland and Jack McKeon each guided the team to World Series victories, 
in 1997 and 2003, respectively;[15] however, the team has never won the 
East Division. Marlins managers have never lost a playoff series, the only 
franchise in Major League Baseball to accomplish the feat.[16] McKeon is 
the franchise leader in wins (281).[15] Joe Girardi won the Manager of 
the Year Award in his only season managing the Marlins (2006); he is the 
only manager to win the award while fielding a team with a losing record, 
and the only manager to win with a team that finished in fourth place in 
its division.[12] Jack McKeon was named the team's interim manager in 2011, 
having been named to the position following the mid-season resignation 
of Edwin Rodríguez.[17][18] At the conclusion of the 2011 season, the Marlins 
hired Ozzie Guillén to be their manager for the 2012 season.[19] After 
firing Guillen, the Marlins named Mike Redmond as their manager. Redmond 
was fired on May 17, 2015 and replaced by Dan Jennings.[20] On October 
29, 2015, it was reported that Mattingly would be signing a four-year contract 
to manage the Miami Marlins.[21] The successor to two previous National 
League franchises in New York City (the Giants and the Dodgers), the New 
York Mets have played in Queens since 1964, when they vacated the Polo 
Grounds in Manhattan and moved to Shea Stadium.[22][23] Casey Stengel was 
the first of twenty managers, and the current manager is Terry Collins.[24] 
Collins' Mets record was 394–416; combined with his managerial tenures 
with the Houston Astros and Anaheim Angels, his record is 838–850.[25] 
The Mets made the playoffs in Collins' fifth season as manager, and played 
in the 2015 World Series. Davey Johnson is the franchise leader in regular-season 
wins, with 595 during his seven-season tenure, while Bobby Valentine's 
467 losses from 1996 to 2002 are the most by a manager in team history, 
though he is second in regular-season wins in the franchise.[24] The National 
League franchise in Philadelphia was established in 1883 following the 
dissolution of Worcester. The team adopted the Philadelphia Phillies name 
in 1884 and has used the moniker, and been located in the city, since that 
time.[26] The team's first manager was Bob Ferguson. Charlie Manuel was 
the manager from 2005 to 2013 until he was fired on August 16, 2013 he 
was replaced by the 3rd base coach Ryne Sandberg. Sandberg resigned on 
June 26, 2015. Pete Mackanin was the replacement. Manuel was the first 
Phillies manager since Dallas Green in 1980 to win a World Series (2008)[27] 
and to lead his team to five consecutive playoff appearances since Danny 
Ozark (1976–1978).[28] Manuel's career managerial record is 867–678, having 
previously managed the Cleveland Indians; his record with the Phillies 
was 780-636 surpassing Gene Mauch's previous regular season record of 645 
wins (1960–68).[29] The Phillies won five consecutive division championships 
(2007–2011) and back-to-back National League pennants (2008–2009) during 
Manuel's tenure.[28] Manuel has the most postseason wins (27) in team history, 
while Ozark has the most playoff losses (9). Larry Bowa is the only Phillies 
skipper to capture the Manager of the Year Award, which he won in 2001.[12] 
Four Phillies managers have been inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball 
Wall of Fame for service to the Phillies: Paul Owens, Bowa, Gavvy Cravath, 
and Green.[30] The Washington Nationals franchise was established in Montreal, 
Quebec in 1969 as an expansion team.[31] Originally known as the Montreal 
Expos,[31] the team's first manager was Gene Mauch, who led the team for 
seven seasons. Felipe Alou is the manager with the most wins (691) and 
losses (717) in franchise history,[32] and won the 1994 Manager of the 
Year Award with the club.[12] Jim Fanning is the only Expos or Nationals 
manager to appear in the Major League Baseball postseason; his .529 regular 
season winning percentage is the highest in franchise history. The only 
other Expos or Nationals manager with a winning percentage above .500 is 
Buck Rodgers (.510),[32] who won the 1987 Manager of the Year Award.[12] 
Dusty Baker was hired as the manager on November 3, 2015. The Chicago Cubs 
franchise began as the Chicago White Stockings in 1876, with Albert Spalding 
as the franchise's inaugural manager. The team's second manager, Cap Anson, 
set team records in games managed (2,194), seasons managed (18), and wins 
(1,242). Frank Chance, part of the famous Tinker to Evers to Chance double-play 
combination—all of whom managed the franchise at some point—has the best 
winning percentage in club history (.664), and is the only manager to lead 
the Cubs franchise to World Series victory, winning in 1907 and 1908.[33] 
During the early 1960s, owner Philip K. Wrigley utilized a "College of 
Coaches", using a rotating system of multiple managers rather than a single 
field leader.[34] Lou Piniella managed the Cubs from 2007–2010 and led 
the team to consecutive postseason appearances in 2007 and 2008,[35] becoming 
the first manager to lead the team to multiple postseasons since Charlie 
Grimm's four appearances from 1932–1935. Dale Sveum was hired for the 2012 
season and let go at the end of the 2013 season. After firing Sveum, Rick 
Renteria was hired as manager. Renteria was replaced as the manager of 
the Cubs by Joe Maddon formerly of the Tampa Bay Rays. Maddon was introduced 
to the press on Nov. 3, 2014. Similar to their division counterparts, the 
Cincinnati Reds were established as the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1882, 
and have employed 59 managers under 3 different names since that time.[36] 
The team's first manager was Pop Snyder, who led the team to an American 
Association championship in their inaugural season.[37] His .648 winning 
percentage is highest among Reds managers who have led the team for more 
than one complete season. Seven managers have led the franchise to the 
postseason, while four have won World Series: Pat Moran in 1919; Bill McKechnie 
in 1940; Sparky Anderson in 1975 and 1976; and Lou Piniella in 1990. Anderson 
is the franchise's all-time leader in regular-season games managed (1,450) 
and regular-season game wins (863).[38] Jack McKeon is the only manager 
to win the Manager of the Year Award with the team,[12] and the current 
manager is Bryan Price who was hired in October 2013 for the 2014 season. 
Dusty Baker was the previous manager whom was ultimately fired after the 
loss in the 2013 playoffs to the Pittsburgh Pirates.[38] Established in 
1969 as the Pilots in Seattle, Washington, the team moved to Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin the following season,[39] which brought top-flight baseball back 
to Wisconsin for the first time since the Braves departed after the 1965 
season.[40] The Brewers have been members of the National League since 
1998; prior to that, the team played as a member of the American League 
Central Division.[41] As such, they are the only team to appear in the 
Major League Baseball postseason representing both major leagues. Buck 
Rodgers and Harvey Kuenn led the team to one American League playoff appearance 
each,[39] and Dale Sveum led the team to the 2008 National League wild 
card after replacing the fired Ned Yost with 12 games remaining in the 
season.[42] Kuenn leads the franchise in playoff wins (6)[43] and is the 
only manager inducted into the Milwaukee Brewers Walk of Fame,[44] while 
Garner is the franchise's all-time managerial wins leader (563).[43] The 
team's current manager is Craig Counsell, a former infielder who played 
part of his career with the Brewers, and who was hired after Ron Roenicke 
was fired on May 3, 2015.[45] The Pittsburgh Pirates joined the National 
League in 1887 after five seasons as members of the American Association.[46] 
Al Pratt was the first manager in franchise history, while the first manager 
after joining Major League Baseball was Horace B. Phillips.[46] The manager 
is currently Clint Hurdle. Fred Clarke, who managed from 1900 through 1915, 
holds franchise records in wins and losses (1422–969), as well as winning 
percentage among managers who led the team for a full season or more (.595).[47] 
Clarke was the first manager to lead the team to the postseason and to 
win a World Series; other managers to do so include Bill McKechnie (one 
playoff appearance, one World Series victory), Chuck Tanner (one playoff 
appearance, one World Series victory), and Danny Murtaugh, who leads franchise 
managers with two World Series victories and five playoff appearances.[47] 
Since their 1882 establishment, the St. Louis Cardinals, originally known 
as the St. Louis Browns, have employed 63 managers.[48] Ned Cuthbert was 
the franchise's original manager, and Mike Matheny is the team's current 
skipper.[49] Tony La Russa leads the team in regular-season and postseason 
wins (1,231 and 33), regular-season and postseason losses (1,029 and 25), 
and playoff appearances (7). La Russa and Hall of Famer Billy Southworth 
won two World Series, tied for the most in club history by a single manager.[49] 
Charles Comiskey leads the team in winning percentage (.685),[b] and is 
one of thirteen Cardinals managers who have been elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame[49]—three of whom (Comiskey, Southworth, Red Schoendienst) 
had multiple tenures with the club.[50][51][52] La Russa and Whitey Herzog 
each won a Manager of the Year award with the Cardinals—Herzog in 1985 
and La Russa in 2002, the fourth of his career.[12] Five managers have 
led the Arizona Diamondbacks since their entry into the National League 
as an expansion team in 1998.[53] Buck Showalter was the team's inaugural 
manager, winning 250 games in three seasons.[54] Bob Brenly, the franchise 
leader in regular-season wins (303) and postseason wins (11), is the only 
manager to win a World Series with the club, in only its fourth season 
of existence.[54] During the 2004 season, Brenly was replaced by his third-base 
coach, Al Pedrique, who won 22 out of his 83 games managed. Bob Melvin 
took over beginning in 2005, amassing a .500 winning percentage in his 
486 games managed.[54] Kirk Gibson was promoted from bench coach to take 
over as manager after A. J. Hinch's dismissal in July 2010, and remained 
as manager before being fired with three games left in the 2014 season.[54][55] 
After firing Gibson, bench coach Alan Trammell managed the club for the 
remaining three games, despite also being fired. The Diamondbacks named 
former Oakland Athletics bench coach Chip Hale as manager. He will manage 
his first season with the team in 2015.He was fired from the managerial 
position on October 3, 2016.[56]On November 4, 2016, Lovullo was hired 
to replace Chip Hale as the Diamondbacks manager for the 2017 season.[57] 
He followed D'backs GM Mike Hazen from Boston to Arizona, and Hazen hired 
Lovullo over fellow finalist Phil Nevin. The Rockies' managerial position 
is currently vacant after Walt Weiss's resignation on October 3, 2016. 
Like the Diamondbacks, the Colorado Rockies have also had five managers 
since the franchise was founded in 1993. Don Baylor, the team's inaugural 
manager, has a .484 winning percentage, best among managers who have led 
the team for one full season or more.[58] He led the team for five seasons, 
accruing a record of 440–469. Jim Leyland followed Baylor, managing the 
Rockies for one season and amassing a 70–92 record, after which he was 
replaced by Buddy Bell. Bell led the Rockies for parts of three seasons 
until he was replaced during the 2002 season by Clint Hurdle. Hurdle, who 
managed the team from 2002 until his firing during the 2009 season, leads 
the franchise in managerial regular-season wins (535) and losses (625), 
as well as playoff wins (7) and losses (4).[58] The most recent manager 
was Walt Weiss. Jim Tracy (baseball), who was Hurdle's bench coach and 
replaced him on May 29, 2009.[59] The Rockies went 74–42 during his partial 
season at the helm, advancing to the 2009 National League Division Series 
against the Phillies; for his efforts, Tracy became the first Rockies manager 
to be named Manager of the Year.[60] Walt Weiss was named the Rockies manager 
for 2013 after Jim Tracy resigned. Weiss led the Rockies to an unexpected 
respectable 2013 campaign and rewarded with a 3-year contract extension 
in October 2013. The Los Angeles Dodgers began play in 1884 as the Brooklyn 
Atlantics and were known by several nicknames before adopting the Dodgers 
name in 1932.[61] Since its inception, the franchise has employed 30 managers.[62] 
George Taylor was the team's manager for their inaugural 1884 season; Dave 
Roberts was announced as the latest manager on November 23, 2015.[63] From 
1954 to 1996, the team employed only two managers, who hold many of the 
team's managerial records. Walter Alston led the team from 1954 until the 
end of the 1976 season, during which time he won 2,040 games and lost 1,613; 
both totals are franchise records, along with his 22 seasons managed.[64] 
He was replaced at the end of the 1976 season by Tommy Lasorda, who managed 
the team until 1996. Lasorda is second behind Alston in wins (1,599) and 
losses (1,439), holds the franchise records for more playoff wins (31) 
and losses (30),[65] and won two Manager of the Year Awards (1983 and 1988).[12] 
Alston and Lasorda are the only managers to lead the team to a World Series 
championship, with Alston winning four during his tenure and Lasorda winning 
two.[64][65] Bill McGunnigle leads all Dodgers managers[c] in winning percentage 
(.660).[66] Two managers, Leo Durocher and Burt Shotton, had multiple tenures 
with the team. Hall of Famers to lead the franchise include Alston, Durocher, 
Lasorda, Casey Stengel, John Montgomery Ward, Wilbert Robinson, Ned Hanlon, 
Max Carey, and Burleigh Grimes;[62] the last three were inducted primarily 
as players rather than managers.[67] The San Diego Padres joined Major 
League Baseball as an expansion team in 1969.[68] Preston Gómez managed 
the team from the inaugural season until 1972.[69] In total, the franchise 
has had 16 managers. Bud Black was employed in the position since being 
hired prior to the 2007 season, and he was fired on June 15, 2015. He was 
replaced by Dave Roberts for 1 game. Then Pat Murphy took over.[70] Bruce 
Bochy is the manager with the longest tenure, leading the team for 12 seasons 
from 1995 through 2006.[69] Bochy is also the only Padres skipper to win 
the Manager of the Year Award,[12] and leads the team in regular-season 
wins (951) and losses (975), as well as playoff wins (8) and losses (16).[69] 
The franchise leader in winning percentage among managers who have led 
the team for a full season or more is Jack McKeon (.541 over three seasons). 
Besides Bochy, Dick Williams is the only Padres manager to lead the team 
to a National League pennant; Williams won 337 games in his four seasons 
with the club and is the only one of San Diego's sixteen managers to be 
elected to the Hall of Fame.[69] On October 29, 2015, Andy Green was named 
manager of the San Diego Padres.[71][72] The San Francisco Giants were 
originally established as the New York Gothams in 1883.[73] In its 127 
Major League Baseball seasons, the franchise has employed 36 managers. 
The first manager in franchise history was John Clapp, and Bruce Bochy, 
who led the division-rival Padres for 12 years, is the team's current manager.[74] 
John McGraw leads the team in regular-season wins (2,583) and losses (1,790), 
games managed (4,424), and playoff wins (26) and losses (28).[75] McGraw's 
three championships are the most among Giants managers; other managers 
to win the league's championship with the franchise include Jim Mutrie 
(two), Durocher (one), and Bill Terry (one).[74] Mutrie leads all Giants 
managers in winning percentage (.605).[76] Hall of Famers to lead the team 
on the field include McGraw, Ward, Durocher, Terry, George Davis, Cap Anson, 
Buck Ewing, Mel Ott, and Frank Robinson[74]—the first African-American 
manager in Major League Baseball.[77] Bruce Bochy is the current manager. 
The Baltimore Orioles franchise was established in 1901 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin 
as the Brewers (not to be confused with the National League team), with 
Hugh Duffy as its inaugural manager.[78] The following season, the team 
moved to St. Louis, Missouri, adopted the St. Louis Browns name, and changed 
managers to Jimmy McAleer.[78] For the 1954 season, the Browns moved to 
Baltimore, Maryland, where they became the Orioles, named after Maryland's 
state bird, and named Jimmie Dykes their new manager.[78] In total, the 
franchise has employed 40 managers since its inception.[79] Earl Weaver 
leads Orioles managers in regular-season wins (1,480) and losses (1,060), 
playoff wins (28) and losses (18), and American League pennants (4).[80] 
Weaver was the second of three managers to lead the Orioles to a World 
Series championship,[80] preceded by Hank Bauer and followed by Joe Altobelli.[81][82] 
Luman Harris is the franchise leader in winning percentage among managers 
who have led the team for more than one full season.[83] Members of the 
National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum to manage the club include Duffy, 
Weaver, Bobby Wallace, Branch Rickey, George Sisler, Rogers Hornsby, Jim 
Bottomley, and Frank Robinson,[79] though Weaver is the only one to have 
been inducted to the Hall for his accomplishments as a manager.[67] Juan 
Samuel was the Orioles' interim manager, having replaced Dave Trembley,[84] 
but was replaced by Buck Showalter in August 2010. The Boston Red Sox of 
Boston, Massachusetts, began in 1901 as the Americans and adopted the Red 
Sox name in 1908.[85] Jimmy Collins was the team's first manager; John 
Farrell is now the manager since the departure of Bobby Valentine at the 
end of the 2012 season.[86] Joe Cronin, a Hall of Famer elected as a player,[67] 
holds franchise records for the most regular-season managerial wins and 
losses (1,071–916),[87] while the team's most successful postseason manager 
is Terry Francona, (28–14 in 42 playoff games managed).[88] Francona and 
Bill Carrigan each led the team to two World Series championships;[88][89] 
other managers to win championships with the team include Collins, who 
won the first World Series in 1903, Jake Stahl, and Ed Barrow,[86] whose 
1918 championship was the team's last until Francona's 2004 win, sometimes 
attributed to the Curse of the Bambino.[90] Stahl is the franchise's leader 
in winning percentage among managers (.621).[91] Besides Cronin, other 
Hall of Fame managers to lead the Red Sox include Collins, Bucky Harris, 
Joe McCarthy, Lou Boudreau, Billy Herman, and Dick Williams;[86] Boudreau 
and Herman were inducted to the Hall of Fame as players.[67] The franchise 
currently known as the New York Yankees was originally established in 1901 
as the Baltimore Orioles (unrelated to their current divisional rivals). 
After moving to New York City in 1903 and adopting the name New York Highlanders, 
the team was renamed the Yankees in 1913.[92] Since the beginning of the 
1901 season, 34 managers have led the Yankees, beginning with John McGraw, 
who managed the team until the middle of the 1902 season, when he was replaced.[93] 
Joe McCarthy, who also managed the rival Red Sox, accumulated the most 
managerial wins (1,460) and losses (867) as a Yankee skipper during his 
tenure encompassing parts of 16 seasons.[94] While leading the Yankees, 
McCarthy won 29 playoff games, the franchise's third-highest total, and 
7 World Series championships,[94] tied for the most in team history with 
Casey Stengel.[95] Joe Torre, who led the Yankees for 12 seasons, has the 
most postseason wins (76) and losses (47) in team history; he won four 
World Series during his tenure.[96] McGraw, McCarthy, Stengel and Torre 
are all members of the Hall of Fame, as are Yankee managers Wilbert Robinson, 
Clark Griffith, Frank Chance, Miller Huggins (who won three World Series 
championships with the Yankees), Bill Dickey, Yogi Berra, and Bob Lemon;[93] 
Chance, Dickey, Berra, and Lemon were inducted as players rather than managers.[67] 
Also notable among Yankee managers is Billy Martin, who was named the Yankees 
skipper for five different tenures, leading the team from 1975 to 1978, 
and during the 1979, 1983, 1985, and 1988 seasons.[97] The current manager 
is Joe Girardi, who went 11–4 in the postseason and won the 2009 World 
Series during his second season as skipper.[93] The Tampa Bay Rays, originally 
named the Devil Rays, joined Major League Baseball at its last expansion 
in 1998.[98] The team's inaugural manager was Larry Rothschild, who spent 
his entire managerial career with the Rays.[99] He managed the team for 
parts of four seasons and accrued a 205–294 record.[100] Rothschild was 
replaced during the 2001 season by Hal McRae.[100] Before the 2003 season, 
McRae was replaced by Lou Piniella, who led the team for three seasons. 
After 2005, Piniella departed and was replaced by Joe Maddon,[100] who 
has statistically been the most successful manager in franchise history. 
Maddon is the only manager to lead the Rays to the postseason, accumulating 
an 8–8 record and leading his team to the 2008 World Series. He leads all 
Rays managers in games managed (648), regular season wins (308) and losses 
(340), and winning percentage (.475).[101] Maddon also won the 2008 and 
2011 American League Manager of the Year Award.[12] Maddon opted out of 
his contract in late October 2014. On December 5, 2014, the Rays hired 
former Cleveland Indians bullpen coach Kevin Cash to replace Maddon. Since 
2005, the Toronto Blue Jays are the only team in Major League Baseball 
based outside of the United States.[102] Established in 1977, the Blue 
Jays' first manager was Roy Hartsfield, who held the position for two seasons.[103] 
The team's current manager is John Gibbons. Toronto's most successful manager, 
Cito Gaston, leads the team in regular-season managerial wins (809) and 
losses (760), postseason appearances (34), and playoff wins (18) and losses 
(16).[104] He is the only manager to win a championship with the Blue Jays; 
the team won consecutive championships in 1992 and 1993,[103] becoming 
the only team to date based outside of the United States to win a World 
Series and, upon completing their 1993 victory, the first team to win a 
World Series on foreign soil.[105] Bobby Cox, who managed the team from 
1982 to 1985,[11] is the only Blue Jays skipper to win the Manager of the 
Year Award, which he received in 1985.[12] Established in 1901, the Chicago 
White Sox have employed 37 managers since the franchise's inception, beginning 
with Clark Griffith.[106] Griffith managed the team for two seasons, and 
is one of nine White Sox managers to be inducted into the Hall of Fame; 
the others include Hugh Duffy, Johnny Evers, Ed Walsh, Eddie Collins, Ray 
Schalk, Ted Lyons, Al López, Bob Lemon and Larry Doby.[106] Jimmie Dykes 
is the all-time leader in regular-season wins and losses (899–940),[107] 
and Fielder Jones' .592 winning percentage leads all White Sox managers.[108] 
Three managers have led the team to a World Series victory: Jones, Pants 
Rowland, and Ozzie Guillén.[106] Guillén is also the franchise's leader 
in playoff victories (12),[109] while Kid Gleason's 5 losses are the highest 
total in team history.[110] Griffith also won one American League championship 
before the modern World Series was contested.[111] The team's current manager 
is Rick Renteria, who was named to the position on October 6, 2011.[112]or 
the 2017 season, Renteria will be replacing White Sox manager Robin Ventura.[113] 
The team now known as the Cleveland Indians has played under several monikers 
since its inception in 1901, including the Cleveland Blues or Bluebirds, 
the Cleveland Bronchos, and the Cleveland Naps[114] (so named because of 
popular player and manager Nap Lajoie).[115] Forty managers have led the 
team, starting with Jimmy McAleer, since it was established in Cleveland, 
Ohio in 1901.[114] Lajoie was the first manager in team history to finish 
his career with a winning record.[116] Lou Boudreau leads all Indians managers 
with 728 wins and 649 losses.[117] He and Tris Speaker are the only managers 
to win a championship with Cleveland: Speaker in 1920 and Boudreau in 1948,[117][118] 
the last championship for the franchise.[119] Other managers to appear 
in the postseason with Cleveland include Al López, Mike Hargrove (who leads 
the team in playoff wins and losses with a record of 27–24), Charlie Manuel, 
and Eric Wedge.[114] The current manager is Terry Francona. The Detroit 
Tigers were founded as members of the Western League in 1894, employing 
Bob Glenalvin as their manager.[120] George Stallings was the team's manager 
from 1898 to 1901,[121] and was the team's field boss when the Western 
League declared itself a major league and became the American League,[122] 
thus becoming the franchise's first Major League Baseball manager. Sparky 
Anderson's 1,331 wins and 1,248 losses lead all Tigers managers.[123] He 
is one of seven Hall of Famers to manage the club; the others include Hughie 
Jennings, Ty Cobb, Mickey Cochrane, Bucky Harris, Ed Barrow, and Joe Gordon.[124] 
Among managers who have led the team for one or more full seasons, Cochrane 
is the franchise leader in winning percentage (.582),[125] and is one of 
four skippers to lead the team to a World Series championship. The others 
are Anderson, Steve O'Neill, and Mayo Smith, who each won one championship 
with the franchise.[120][124] The Tigers' most recent manager was Jim Leyland 
who retired at the end of the 2013 American League Championship Series 
(loss to Boston). The current manager (as of 2014 season) is Brad Ausmus.[124] 
The Kansas City Royals were added to the American League in a 1969 expansion 
after the city's first Major League Baseball franchise departed for Oakland, 
California.[126] Joe Gordon, one of two Hall of Famers to manage the Royals, 
was selected as the team's first manager, leading the team for one season.[127] 
Bob Lemon, who took over during the 1970 season, is the second member of 
the Hall of Fame to lead the team, and managed until the end of 1972.[128] 
Whitey Herzog is the franchise leader in regular-season wins (410) and 
winning percentage[d] (.574), and Tony Muser is the loss leader (431).[128] 
Dick Howser is the leader in postseason wins and losses (8–12).[128] Trey 
Hillman led the Royals for parts of three seasons after a five-year managerial 
career in Japan,[129] but was fired May 13, 2010, and replaced by current 
manager Ned Yost.[130] The Minnesota franchise began its life as the Washington 
Senators in Washington, D. C., where they played from their inception in 
1901 to 1960.[131] In the early 20th century, the Senators were managed 
consecutively by three future members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, bookended 
by Bucky Harris, who managed the team from 1924 to 1928 and again from 
1935 to 1942. Walter Johnson, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame as 
a player,[67] managed the team for four seasons from 1929 to 1932,[132] 
and he was followed by Joe Cronin, also inducted as a player,[67] who led 
for the next two seasons (1933–1934).[132] Clark Griffith is the only other 
Hall of Famer to manage the Senators/Twins franchise.[132] In 1960, the 
American League awarded an expansion franchise to Minneapolis, Minnesota; 
however, owner Calvin Griffith moved his team to Minnesota,[133][134] and 
Washington was awarded the expansion team instead. Thus, the Minnesota 
Twins began play in Minnesota the following year, during the tenure of 
manager Cookie Lavagetto.[135] Harris and Tom Kelly are the two managers 
to win a World Series championship with the franchise, one in the Senators 
era (Harris) and two during the team's tenure in Minnesota (Kelly).[136] 
Kelly is also the franchise leader in wins and losses, the only manager 
to exceed 1,000 in each category (1,140–1,244 in 16 seasons).[132] Ron 
Gardenhire was fired of managerial duties in October 2014, as he was replaced 
by Paul Molitor.[132] The city of Houston, Texas was awarded an expansion 
franchise in the National League in 1962 after the dissolution of the Continental 
League.[137] The team, which began play as the Colt .45s, changed its name 
to the Houston Astros in 1965.[138] The team's first manager was Harry 
Craft, while the first manager under the Astros moniker was Grady Hatton. 
Bill Virdon is the all-time leader for the most regular-season games managed 
(1,066) and wins (544), while Phil Garner has won the most playoff games 
(7).[139] Larry Dierker, the only manager whose number is retired by the 
franchise,[140] is the winning percentage leader (.556).[a] Brad Mills 
replaced Cecil Cooper—who was fired with 13 games remaining in the 2009 
season—and Dave Clark, Cooper's interim replacement.[139] On August 18, 
2012, Mills was fired, and Tony DeFrancesco was named the interim manager.[141] 
On September 27, 2012, Bo Porter became the 17th manager in Astros history.[142] 
Porter was fired in September 2014, and replaced with interim manager Tom 
Lawless. AJ Hinch was hired as permanent manager in October 2014. Playing 
under various names such as the Los Angeles Angels, California Angels, 
and Anaheim Angels, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim have been members 
of the American League since 1961.[143] The team's first manager, Bill 
Rigney, led the squad for parts of eight seasons until his release in mid-1969.[144] 
The current manager is Mike Scioscia, who holds most of the Angels' franchise 
records for manager.[144] He is the only Angels skipper to be named Manager 
of the Year, a distinction he has earned twice (2002, 2009).[12] His regular-season 
wins (1066) and losses (878), postseason wins (21) and losses (24), and 
winning percentage (.548)[e] are the highest of any manager in team history.[144] 
Dick Williams is the only Angels manager who has been inducted to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame. Five managers have served multiple terms with the team: Gene 
Mauch, John McNamara, Buck Rodgers, Marcel Lachemann, and Joe Maddon.[144] 
While the Oakland Athletics have played under the same name since their 
establishment in 1901, the team has played in three different locations 
under that moniker. The franchise was initially based in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania and was managed by Connie Mack, a member of the Baseball Hall 
of Fame and often called one of the best managers in the history of the 
game.[145][146] Mack led the team from 1901 to 1950; his 50 seasons managed 
are a Major League Baseball record which has been called "unbreakable".[147] 
He managed 7,466 games, accruing a record of 3,582 wins and 3,814 losses; 
all three totals are also Major League Baseball records.[5] Over the course 
of his career, Mack led the Athletics to nine American League pennants 
and five World Series championships.[148] His 24 wins and 19 losses in 
the postseason are both franchise records.[149] Three Athletics managers 
were inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame in recognition 
of their services to the team while it played in Pennsylvania: Mack, Jimmy 
Dykes, and Eddie Joost.[150] The team moved to Kansas City, Missouri in 
1955, at the beginning of Lou Boudreau's tenure as manager, and then moved 
on to Oakland, California in 1968.[151] Boudreau is also a member of the 
Hall of Fame, in addition to Mack; other inductees to manage the Athletics 
include Joe Gordon and Luke Appling, both inducted as players,[67] and 
Dick Williams, whose .603 winning percentage leads all Athletics skippers.[149] 
The Athletics are currently managed by Bob Melvin, who replaced Bob Geren 
early in the 2011 season.[149] The Seattle Mariners franchise was established 
in 1977, the successor to the earlier Pilots team that moved to Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin.[152] In their inaugural season, the Mariners hired Darrell Johnson 
as their first manager; he led the team for parts of four seasons, through 
the middle of 1980.[153] After that point, no Mariners skipper started 
his new tenure at the beginning of the season until Jim Snyder in 1989.[154] 
Statistically, Lou Piniella is the most successful manager in Mariners 
history; he is the franchise leader in games managed (1,551), regular-season 
wins and losses (840–711), and winning percentage (.542).[153] He is also 
the only Mariners skipper to appear in the postseason, accruing a 15–19 
record in 34 playoff games,[154] and is the only person to win the Manager 
of the Year Award with the club, capturing the award in 1995 and 2001.[12] 
Don Wakamatsu, the first Asian-American manager in Major League Baseball 
history, was the team's skipper from 2009 until he was fired on August 
9, 2010.[155] Eric Wedge, who resigned with three games left in the 2013 
season (he stayed with team until last game) citing his and the organizations 
vision for the future had changed.[156] Lloyd McClendon became the Mariners 
manager in late 2013, managing the Mariners to a winning record in 2014. 
McClendon was fired October 9, 2015. Scott Servais was hired as a manager 
in October 23, 2015. When the Minnesota Twins moved to Minneapolis for 
the 1961 season, a new Washington Senators team was established in the 
United States capital as an expansion franchise,[157] with Mickey Vernon 
as manager.[158] The new Senators played in Washington, D. C. for 11 seasons, 
finishing with a winning percentage over .500 only once—under Ted Williams 
in 1969.[159] After the 1971 season, the team moved to Arlington, Texas 
and became the Texas Rangers, named after the Texas Ranger Division of 
the state's law enforcement agency.[157][160] Bobby Valentine, who led 
the team for parts of eight seasons (1985–1992), is the franchise leader 
in managerial wins and losses in the regular season (581–605). Johnny Oates 
was the first Rangers manager to lead the team to the postseason; his playoff 
record is 1–9.[159] Oates and Buck Showalter have won the Manager of the 
Year Award with the team.[12] Among managers who have led the Rangers for 
a full season or more, Billy Hunter amassed the highest winning percentage 
(.575).[159] Ron Washington led the Rangers since 2007, but resigned in 
September 2014 to focus on his family.[161] Tim Bogar took over as interim 
manager for the Rangers. In early October 2014 the Rangers named Jeff Banister
