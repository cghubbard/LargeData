The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball 
(MLB) and concludes the MLB postseason. First played in 1903,[1] the World 
Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff and is 
a contest between the champions of baseball's National League (NL) and 
American League (AL).[2] Often referred to as the "Fall Classic",[3] the 
modern World Series has been played every year since 1903 with two exceptions: 
in 1904, when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion 
Boston Americans; and in 1994, when the series was canceled due to the 
players' strike.[1][2][4][5] The best-of-seven style has been the format 
of all World Series except in 1903, 1919, 1920 and 1921, when the winner 
was determined through a best-of-nine playoff.[1][2] The Series-winning 
team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy.[6] Players, coaches, and others 
associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate 
their victory; however, they have received other items such as pocket watches 
and medallions in the past.[7] The team that won the World Series in any 
given year is traditionally invited to the White House to meet the President 
of the United States.[8] A total of 112 Series have been contested, with 
the NL champion winning 48 and the AL champion winning 64. The New York 
Yankees of the AL have played in 40 of the 112 Series through 2016, and 
have won 27 World Series championships, the most Series appearances and 
victories of any Major League franchise. The Yankees have also lost more 
Series (13) than any other club. The St. Louis Cardinals, who represented 
the NL for a 19th time in 2013, have won 11 championships, which is the 
second-most among all 30 Major League teams as well as most among NL teams.[3] 
Only the Giants have been NL champions more times, appearing in 20 World 
Series (14 as the New York Giants and six representing San Francisco), 
with eight Series victories (second-most in the National League), including 
their most recent in 2014. The Seattle Mariners and the Washington Nationals 
(formerly Montreal Expos) are the only current Major League franchises 
to have never appeared in the World Series; the Houston Astros, San Diego 
Padres, Colorado Rockies, Texas Rangers (formerly the 1961â€“1971 version 
of the Washington Senators), Tampa Bay Rays, and Milwaukee Brewers (formerly 
Seattle Pilots) have played in the Series but have never won it. The Toronto 
Blue Jays are the only franchise from outside the United States to appear 
in a World Series, winning in 1992 and 1993. Numbers in parentheses in 
the table are World Series appearances, as of the date of that World Series 
and are used as follows: In the sortable table below, teams are ordered 
first by number of appearances, then by number of wins, and finally by
