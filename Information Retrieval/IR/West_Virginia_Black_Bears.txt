The West Virginia Black Bears are a Minor League Baseball team based in 
Morgantown, West Virginia. The team began play in the New York–Penn League 
in 2015 as an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates. The team is owned by 
Bob Rich, Jr. and plays at Monongalia County Ballpark in Granville, a town 
located across the Monongahela River from Morgantown. In August 2014, it 
was announced that the Jamestown Jammers would cease operations and move 
to Morgantown.[1] On October 22, the team announced that they would be 
named the "Black Bears" following a fan vote, as the American black bear 
is the state animal of West Virginia.[2] In January 2015, Wyatt Toregas 
was named as their inaugural manager.[3] The Black Bears won the New York–Penn 
League wild card in their inaugural season.[4] The team then defeated the 
Williamsport Crosscutters and the Staten Island Yankees to win the 2015 
New York–Penn League Championship.[5] Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders
