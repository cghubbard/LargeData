The Pittsburgh Pirates have completed 130 seasons in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) since joining the National League (NL) in 1887. Through 2016, they 
have played 19,933 regular season games, winning 10,083 and losing 9,850, 
for a winning percentage of .506. The Pirates are also a combined total 
of 43—53 (.448) in post-season play. Prior to joining the National League 
in 1887 the franchise compiled a record of 236—296 (.444) in five seasons 
of the American Association.[1] This list documents the season-by-season 
records of the Pirates’ franchise including their years as the “Alleghenies”[l] 
(alternately spelled Alleghenys[1]). The Pirates moved from the American 
Association to the National League after owner William Nimick became upset 
over a contract dispute, thus establishing the extant franchise.[2] The 
team currently plays home games at PNC Park which they moved into in 2001. 
Prior to PNC Park, the Pirates played home games at Three Rivers Stadium 
and Forbes Field, among other stadiums.[3] In 1903, the Pirates were defeated 
by the Boston Americans in the first World Series. The Pirates returned 
to and won the World Series in 1909, over the Detroit Tigers. Since then 
the Pirates have won World Series in 1925, 1960, 1971, and 1979. In addition 
to these five World Series victories the Pirates have won nine National 
League pennants and qualified for the playoffs fifteen times,[1] six of 
which were during a run of twelve winning seasons between 1969 and 1980. 
The Pirates have had several major period of failure: the franchise had 
a losing record every season from 1949 to 1957 and in 1952 suffered the 
worst record by an established MLB franchise between 1936 and 2002. They 
did not once make the playoffs during the 1980s and from 1993 to 2012 suffered 
twenty consecutive seasons with a losing record — setting a United States 
professional sports record. In 2013 the Pirates won 94 games to end that 
streak, in the process clinching the National League’s top wild card berth 
in Major League Baseball’s postseason.[4] The franchise's original colors 
were red and blue, which were switched to black and gold—colors that all 
professional Pittsburgh sports franchises now share[5][6]—for the 1948 
season.[7] These statistics are current as of October 2, 2016. Bold denotes 
a playoff season, pennant or championship; italics denote an active season.
