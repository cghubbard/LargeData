Chester is a city in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States, with 
a population of 33,972 at the 2010 census.[2] Chester is situated on the 
Delaware River, between the cities of Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware. 
The current mayor of Chester is Thaddeus Kirkland, elected on November 
3, 2015 and serving his first day in office on January 4, 2016. The first 
European settlers in the area were Swedes. They called the settlement that 
became Chester first "Finlandia" (the Latin name for Finland), then "Upland" 
(see the Swedish province of Uppland and the borough of Upland). They built 
Fort Mecoponacka in 1641 to defend the settlement.[3] By 1682, Upland was 
the most populous town of the new Province of Pennsylvania. On October 
27, the ship Welcome arrived at the town, bearing William Penn on his first 
visit to the province. Penn renamed the settlement for the English city 
of Chester.[citation needed] Chester served as the county seat for Chester 
County, which then stretched from the Delaware River to the Susquehanna 
River. In 1789, the city became the county seat for the newly created Delaware 
County (whereupon Chester County became landlocked, with West Chester as 
its county seat), but the county seat was moved to the borough of Media 
in 1851. The courthouse is near the new City Hall building.[citation needed] 
Chester's naval shipyard supplied the Union during the Civil War, and the 
United States in subsequent wars until the shipyard at Philadelphia became 
dominant after World War II. America's largest postbellum shipyard, John 
Roach's Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works, was also located 
in Chester, and the location was repurposed by the Ford Motor Company with 
the Chester Assembly factory until 1961. The Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock 
Co., later Pennsylvania Shipyard & Dry Dock Company, was located in Chester 
until it closed in 1990. Two ships of the United States Navy have been 
named USS Chester in honor of the city. On April 10, 1917, an explosion 
at the Eddystone Ammunition Corporation near Chester resulted in the deaths 
of 133 workers, mostly women.[4] Chester is one of numerous places that 
claim to be the birthplace of the hoagie sandwich.[5] It is also known 
as the "Cradle of Rock 'n Roll", as Bill Haley & His Comets first performed 
and maintained their headquarters in the Chester area.[6][better source needed] 
The following are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Delaware 
County National Bank, 1724 Chester Courthouse, Chester Waterside Station 
of the Philadelphia Electric Company, Old Main and Chemistry Building, 
William Penn Landing Site, and the former Second Street Bridge.[7] Chester 
began losing its mainstay shipyard and automobile manufacturing jobs as 
early as the 1960s, causing the population to be halved in fifty years 
from over 66,000 in 1950 to under 34,000 in 2010. Poverty and crime rose 
as the city declined. In 1995, the state designated Chester as a financially 
distressed municipality. Soon thereafter, the city's schools ranked last 
among the state's 501 districts, leading Pennsylvania education officials 
in 2001 to hire the for-profit Edison Schools to run the local school district 
for three years.[8] When Chester became eligible for Pennsylvania's Keystone 
Opportunity Zone (KOZ) program, firms began to accept state and local tax 
breaks to invest in KOZ-designated areas. The Wharf at Rivertown, a $60 
million renovation of the Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO)'s 396,000 sq ft 
(36,800 m2) generating plant, which was originally built in Chester in 
1918, has returned the waterfront to the local residents, providing both 
recreational and office space for new local endeavors.[9][10] One of its 
tenants is AdminServer, which makes software for the insurance industry. 
It moved from Malvern, Pennsylvania in 2003 and was acquired by Oracle 
in 2007.[11][12] Sun Shipbuilding converted part of the shipyard to a smaller 
shipping concern and sold its interest, then sold off portions of the rest 
to new users, such as the Pennsylvania State Correctional Institution – 
Chester. Harrah's Casino and Racetrack built its facilities beginning in 
2005, launching harness racing along the Delaware River in September 2006, 
and its racino in January 2007. Chester has a mayor-council government 
system, consisting of a popularly elected city mayor and city council. 
The terms of the mayor and members are four years.[13] The Chester City 
Council is made up of four members and the presiding officer, the mayor. 
The current mayor of the City of Chester is State Rep. Thaddeus Kirkland 
who won the Democratic nomination in May of 2015 over incumbent Mayor John 
Linder[14][15]. Council members are elected at large to serve the entire 
city. Council meetings are generally held the second and fourth Wednesday 
of each month. Under the Administrative Code of the city, each council 
member serves as a department head for one of the five municipal departments. 
Those municipal departments are[16]: Chester is a Third Class City, and 
was approved by the citizens on April 20, 1980, as a Home Rule Charter 
Community.[17] Under the home rule form of government, the city council 
has been given all the legislative power to create ordinances, rules and 
regulations so the city can provide for the health, safety and well-being 
of its citizens.[citation needed] The city has a police department of about 
one hundred officers.[18] The city government has been in financial distress 
for many years. It has operated under the state's Act 47 provisions for 
twenty years. The act provides for municipalities that are near bankruptcy.[19] 
The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections operates the State Correctional 
Institution – Chester, a drug treatment facility, in Chester.[20] The city 
is scheduled to exit the program in May 2018, which may force it into bankruptcy..[21] 
The United States Postal Service operates the Chester Post Office.[22] 
Chester borders on (clockwise from southwest to northeast) Trainer Borough, 
Upper Chichester Township, Chester Township, Upland Borough, Parkside Borough, 
Brookhaven Borough, Nether Providence Township, Ridley Township, and Eddystone 
Borough in Pennsylvania. Across the Delaware River, the city faces Gloucester 
County, New Jersey, and while most of its riverfront borders Logan Township, 
the easternmost portion of the city borders Greenwich Township. The city 
has a total area of 6.0 square miles (15.6 km2), 4.8 square miles (12.5 km2) 
of which is land and 1.2 square miles (3.0 km2) of which (19.42%) is water, 
according to the United States Census Bureau.[2] Being at a low elevation 
between Philadelphia and Wilmington, Chester experiences a humid subtropical 
climate (Cfa) bordering a humid continental climate (Dfa.) The hardiness 
zone is 7b. As of the census of 2010, there were 33,972 people living in 
the city. The racial makeup of the city was 17.2% White, 74.7% Black, 0.4% 
Native American, 0.6% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian, 3.9% of some other race, 
and 3.0% from two or more races. 9.0% were Hispanic or Latino of any race.[27] 
There were 11,662 households, out of which 37.3% had children under the 
age of 18 living with them, 19.5% were headed by married couples living 
together, 35.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 38.1% 
were non-families. 31.2% of all households were made up of individuals, 
and 11.1% were someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 2.64, and the average family size was 3.34.[27] 
For the period 2010-2014, the estimated median annual income for a household 
in the city was $28,607, and the median income for a family was $34,840. 
Male full-time workers had a median income of $34,354 versus $30,634 for 
females. The per capita income for the city was $15,516. About 27.3% of 
families and 33.1% of the total population were below the poverty line, 
including 47.7% of those under age 18 and 18.4% of those age 65 or over.[28] 
In Chester, east-west streets are numbered, while north-south streets carry 
names. The main bisecting street, known as The Avenue of the States south 
of 9th Street and Edgmont Avenue north of it, is signed as both Pennsylvania 
Route 320 (southbound only; northbound PA Rt. 320 uses adjacent Madison 
Street to Interstate 95) and Pennsylvania Route 352. North of I-95, State 
Route 320 follows Providence Avenue. Between 1993 and 2006, the Pennsylvania 
Department of Transportation (PennDOT) widened and realigned Pennsylvania 
Route 291 from Trainer to Eddystone from a two-lane roadway to a five-lane 
roadway. This widening and realignment project, spearheaded by the late 
State Senator Clarence D. Bell of Upland, allows PA Route 291 to maintain 
at least two travel lanes in each direct between the refinery towns of 
Marcus Hook and Trainer and the Philadelphia International Airport, as 
well as promote the riverfront development in the city. Prior to the realignment, 
which was done first, the roadway followed 2nd Street to Crosby Street, 
then bore right onto E. 4th Street, widening to four lanes and becoming 
the "Industrial Highway" in Eddystone. Post-realignment, the road now follows 
W. 2nd Street to Concord Avenue, becoming the "Industrial Highway" past 
Concord Avenue and bypassing the Kimberly-Clark (formerly Scott Paper) 
processing facility. Chester is served by two interstate highways: Interstate 
95 and Interstate 476, which meet in nearby Eddystone. I-95 was built in 
the 1960s and originally terminated just north of the Chester/Eddystone 
line at the present-day I-95/I-476 junction. It was extended north in the 
1970s, with the section around Philadelphia International Airport being 
completed in 1985. Three exits on I-95 allow access to Highland Avenue, 
Kerlin Street, and Edgmont Avenue/Avenue of the States (Rts. 320 & 352), 
with access to Widener University, via State Rt. 320. Of the three, only 
Kerlin Street is a partial exit, although the Avenue of the States exit 
was also a partial exit until the completion of a southbound on-ramp, spearheaded 
by the late State Sen. Bell, was completed in 2002. I-476, planned as an 
alternative route to State Rt. 320 since the 1920s and an original planned 
extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in the 1950s (as part of the 1,000-mile 
(1,600 km) Turnpike network), was finally opened to traffic in 1992. An 
exit in Ridley Township at MacDade Boulevard (which becomes 22nd Street 
in Chester) allows access to I-476 without having to use I-95. Two federal 
highway routes, U.S. Route 13 and U.S. Route 322, also run through Chester. 
US 13 enters Chester from Trainer on W. 4th Street, becomes part of Highland 
Avenue between W. 4th Street and W. 9th Street, and then continues on 9th 
Street to Morton Avenue. US 13 follows Morton Avenue in the city's Sun 
Village section until it crosses Ridley Creek and becomes Chester Pike 
in Eddystone. US 322 enters Chester as a part of I-95 (merging on at Highland 
Avenue) and then departs I-95 at the Commodore Barry Bridge exit. Prior 
to the bridge's opening in 1974, US 322 would cross the Delaware River 
on the Chester-Bridgeport Ferry, via Flower Street, causing major backups 
because of limited space on the ferries. With the expansion of State Rt. 
291 and the redevelopment of the Chester Waterfront, both the Delaware 
River Port Authority and PennDOT built a pair of entrance (westbound) and 
exit (eastbound) ramps to PA Rt. 291, providing direct access to the waterfront 
without using local streets.[citation needed] The ramps were built between 
2007 and 2010 and were opened in 2011.[citation needed] Talks have taken 
place for the reconstruction of US 322 from a two-lane road to a four-lane 
road between Chester and U.S. 1 in Concordville, and the Highland Avenue 
exit. The road currently requires traffic to merge onto I-95 in the left 
lane and requires changing lanes three times to the Commodore Barry Bridge 
exit ramp in less than a mile. Such a major undertaking would result in 
the demolition of numerous homes in the city's crime-plagued Highland Gardens 
section, along with condemning properties in nearby Chester Township, as 
I-95 passes through both municipalities between US 322 and the Commodore 
Barry Bridge. Public transportation in Chester is provided by the Southeastern 
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), which acquired the former 
Suburban Philadelphia Transit Authority (aka "Red Arrow" Lines) in 1968. 
Seven bus routes (Routes 37, 109, 113, 114, 117, 118, and 119) serve the 
city, with the Chester Transportation Center in the city's business district, 
serving as the hub. Route 37 connects Chester with Philadelphia and the 
Philadelphia International Airport, while Route 113 from 69th Street Terminal 
connects Chester with the state of Delaware. Both Routes 37 and 113 provide 
direct service to the Harrah's Philadelphia Racetrack and Casino located 
within the city, with Route 113 also providing service to the Philadelphia 
Union's Talen Energy Stadium soccer-specific stadium on the city's waterfront. 
The city is also served by SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line commuter rail 
service, via Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. The Chester Transportation Center, 
serves as the main bus hub and the main train station in the city, while 
the Highland Avenue station, located approximately 4 miles (6 km) southwest 
of Chester T.C. station, is also served by Wilmington/Newark trains. A 
third station, at Lamokin Street, located approximately a mile east of 
the Commodore Barry Bridge at the junction of the NEC and the abandoned 
Penn Central Chester Creek Secondary Branch, was operated by SEPTA as a 
flagstop station until it was closed and demolished in 2003 due to low 
usage. Historically, the Chester Transportation Center was, like the Paoli 
station on the Paoli/Thorndale Line, both a commuter and intercity stop 
on the former Pennsylvania Railroad's New York–Washington route. But when 
Amtrak took over intercity rail passenger services in 1971, the Chester 
Transportation Center was bypassed, except from April 30, 1978, to October 
29, 1983, when the Chesapeake stopped once daily in each direction between 
Philadelphia and Washington. The Chester-Upland School District serves 
the city, along with nearby Chester Township and Upland. Chester High School 
is currently the district's sole high school, but a recent approval by 
the district's empowerment board will see the development of two magnet 
schools; one dedicated to the arts and another for science and technology.[citation 
needed] The St. Katharine Drexel Parish, established in 1993 by the Archdiocese 
of Philadelphia with the consolidation of all Roman Catholic parishes in 
the city, maintains the city's only parochial school. St. James High School 
for Boys, the city's "other high school" and for many years, the main football 
rival for Chester High School, closed its doors in 1993 due to decreased 
enrollment. The nearest Catholic high school to Chester is Cardinal O'Hara 
High School in Springfield or, to parts of Chester, Archmere Academy in 
Claymont, Delaware. Chester Community Charter School is a charter school 
established in 1998 that serves over 2,000 students in grades K-8.[29][30] 
It is currently run by Steven Lee. New school Chester Charter School for 
the Arts was established in 2012 and currently house 460 children K-9 (adding 
on until 12). In 2017, New building will be established on Highland Ave. 
With the construction of Harrah's Philadelphia, the city received a series 
of horse races that were once held at the Brandywine Raceway and the now-defunct 
Liberty Bell Park Racetrack. The racino opened on January 22, 2008, and 
features a specially-constructed bridge that enables the midpoint of races, 
contested at one mile, to take place over the Delaware River. Chester is 
the home of the Philadelphia Union, which plays its home games at Talen 
Energy Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium at the base of the Commodore 
Barry Bridge. Located on the Delaware River, the stadium is part of a larger 
development called Rivertown. Financing for the Rivertown development was 
announced in early 2008 by Governor Ed Rendell and Pennsylvania Senate 
Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi, with $25 million going to the construction 
of Talen Energy Stadium, and an additional $7 million towards a two-phase 
project composing of 186 townhouses, 25 apartments, 335,000 square feet 
(31,100 m2) of office space, a 200,000-square-foot (19,000 m2) convention 
center, more than 20,000 square feet (1,900 m2) of retail space, and a 
parking structure to house 1,350 cars. In phase two, another 200 apartments 
will be built, along with 100,000 square feet (9,300 m2) of office space
