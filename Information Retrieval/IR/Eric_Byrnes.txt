Eric James Byrnes (born February 16, 1976), is a former Major League Baseball 
outfielder. He has played for the Oakland Athletics, the Colorado Rockies, 
the Baltimore Orioles, the Arizona Diamondbacks, and the Seattle Mariners. 
He retired after his stint with the Mariners, and he now is an analyst 
for MLB Network and radio host on KNBR . Byrnes was considered a player 
who relied on his speed and hustle.[1] He could hit for power, but tended 
to be a "free-swinger" and went through hitting droughts.[1] He was ranked 
in the top-three for best defensive left fielders in John Dewan's publication, 
Fielding Bible.[2] Byrnes' high school career was spent in the Western 
Catholic Athletic League, where he played for St. Francis High School in 
Mountain View, California.[3] He regularly competed in Baseball and Football 
against Serra High School's Tom Brady, and Bellarmine College Prep's Pat 
Burrell. After graduating in 1994, he was selected in the Major League 
Baseball Draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers but elected to go to college 
at the University of California at Los Angeles. At UCLA (1995–98), Byrnes 
hit second in the batting order and played right field in a lineup that 
featured future major-league stars Troy Glaus (1995–97) and Garrett Atkins 
(1998). He was again selected in the Major League Baseball Draft, this 
time by the Houston Astros after his junior season, but again elected to 
stay in school. He finished his career at UCLA as one of the most successful 
hitters in Pac-10 history with a .331 career average and 75 doubles, a 
conference record. He was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame 
in 2013. Byrnes was selected in the 8th round of the 1998 Major League 
Baseball Draft by the Oakland Athletics. In the 1998 season, Byrnes played 
for the short-season Southern Oregon Timberjacks, and the Class-A Advanced 
Visalia Oaks in the A's organization where he batted a combined .357 with 
19 doubles, 4 triples, 11 home runs, 52 RBIs, and 17 stolen bases. In 1999, 
Byrnes continued to play in the A's minor leagues. That season, he played 
for the Class-A Advanced Modesto A's, and the Double-A Midland RockHounds 
and in 139 combined games, Byrnes batted .306 with 42 doubles, 1 triple, 
7 home runs, 88 RBIs, and 34 stolen bases. Byrnes made his major league 
debut on August 22, 2000, against the Cleveland Indians.[4] He went 2-for-4 
with a stolen base in his first games, playing designated hitter and batting 
seventh in the batting order.[5] Byrnes batted .300 his first season, with 
three hits in ten at-bats.[4] The next season, 2001, Byrnes played 19 games 
with the A's. He hit his first home run of his major league career on June 
9, 2001, against the San Francisco Giants.[6] He batted .237 with one double, 
three home runs, five RBIs, and one stolen base with the A's in 2001.[4] 
Byrnes played two games in the 2001 American League Division Series against 
the New York Yankees going hitless in two at-bats.[4] Byrnes was also involved 
in a 2003 baseball game that included two significant base running gaffes 
in a single inning. With a chance to close out the Boston Red Sox, the 
Athletics had a potential rally stifled by two controversial plays. Byrnes 
was tagged out after failing to touch home plate after a collision with 
catcher Jason Varitek, who had blocked the plate before attempting to catch 
the ball. After the collision, a hobbling Byrnes shoved Varitek and began 
walking back to the dugout. Varitek picked up the ball and tagged Byrnes 
out. This play was then followed up by Red Sox third baseman Bill Mueller 
running into Miguel Tejada as he was rounding third (later in the same 
inning). Tejada then stopped running home and was eventually tagged out. 
The umpires called Tejada out because he was tagged as a result of not 
attempting to advance home, not because of the obstruction by the third 
baseman. In 2003, Byrnes hit for the cycle.[7] In 2004, Byrnes had his 
best year with the A's, batting .283 with 20 home runs and 73 RBI. On July 
13, 2005, Byrnes, along with prospect Omar Quintanilla, was traded to the 
Colorado Rockies for pitchers Joe Kennedy and Jay Witasick.[8] In 15 games 
with the Rockies, Byrnes batted .189 with 2 doubles, 5 RBIs, and 2 stolen 
bases. A little over two weeks later, and a day before the trading deadline, 
on July 30, 2005, Byrnes was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for outfielder 
Larry Bigbie. On August 15, 2005, Byrnes and the Orioles traveled to Oakland, 
marking the first time Byrnes played against his former team.[9] After 
struggling against right-handed pitchers, the Orioles benched Byrnes and 
questioned his ability to be an every-day player.[10] In 52 games with 
the Orioles that season, Byrnes batted .192 with 7 doubles, 1 triple, 3 
home runs, 11 RBIs, and 3 stolen bases. In his combined totals that season 
between the Oakland Athletics, the Colorado Rockies, and the Orioles, Byrnes 
batted .231 with 22 doubles, 3 triples, 10 home runs, 35 RBIs, and 5 stolen 
bases in 111 games. After the 2005 season, Byrnes was granted free agency. 
On December 30, 2005, Byrnes signed a one-year, $2.25 million contract 
with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[11][12] Byrnes stated that he was excited 
for the opportunity to play center field regularly.[13] In 2006, Byrnes 
batted .267 with 37 doubles, 3 triples, 26 home runs, 79 RBIs, and 25 stolen 
bases. His 26 home runs led the Diamondbacks, as did his stolen bases, 
and his slugging percentage of .482.[14] Midway through the 2007 season, 
Byrnes was rewarded with a three-year, $30 million contract extension with 
the Arizona Diamondbacks. Byrnes is one of a few players to have 50 stolen 
bases and hit 20 home runs in one season, having accomplished the feat 
in 2007. At the end on the 2007 season, Byrnes batted .286 with 30 doubles, 
8 triples, 21 home runs, 83 RBIs and 50 stolen bases in 160 games. He led 
the Diamondbacks in doubles, RBIs, stolen bases, caught stealing (7), and 
total bases (288).[15] Byrnes was also 11th in National League Most Valuable 
Player Award voting with 43 voting points.[16] He was honored with a Fielding 
Bible Award as the best fielding left fielder in MLB.[17] On May 27, 2008, 
Byrnes was placed on the 15-day disabled list for the 1st time in his career 
with sore hamstrings.[citation needed] Byrnes underwent an MRI that showed 
he had tears in both of his hamstrings.[citation needed] Byrnes returned 
to the team on June 23, 2008, batting leadoff against the Boston Red Sox 
at Fenway Park.[citation needed] At the end of the 2008 season, Byrnes 
batted .209 with 13 doubles, 1 triple, 6 home runs, 24 RBIs, and 4 stolen 
bases in 52 games. On June 25, 2009, Byrnes was placed on the disabled 
list with broken left hand.[18] He was injured during a game against the 
Texas Rangers after opposing pitcher Scott Feldman hit Byrnes on the hand 
with a pitch.[18] After he sustained the injury, he was replaced by Ryan 
Roberts.[18] He was reinstated from the disabled list on September 5, 2009.[19] 
He played 16 minor league games during his rehab stint with the Triple-A 
Reno Aces, batting .279 with seven doubles, one triple, two home runs, 
nine RBIs, and one stolen base. On January 15, 2010, Byrnes was designated 
for assignment by the Arizona Diamondbacks to make room on the 40-man roster 
for Adam LaRoche.[20] Byrnes had shown interest in joining the San Francisco 
Giants after he was designated for assignment by the Diamondbacks, however, 
on January 29, 2010, Byrnes signed a one-year, $400,000 contract with the 
Seattle Mariners.[2][21] To make room for Byrnes on the 40-man roster, 
the Mariners designated first baseman Tommy Everidge for assignment.[2] 
The Diamondbacks are still responsible for the remaining $11 million on 
his contract he had with them before being released.[22] Byrnes was slated 
to share playing time in the outfield with Milton Bradley at the time of 
his signing.[2] Byrnes said this about being signed by the Mariners: Byrnes 
was released by the Mariners on May 2, 2010 after batting .094 with 3 hits 
in 32 at-bats, 1 run scored, 2 doubles, 9 strikeouts, and 6 bases on balls 
in 15 games on the season with Seattle.[23] In a press release by the Mariners, 
general manager Jack Zduriencik said that, "Eric Byrnes is a tremendous 
competitor and a credit to baseball. We wish him only the best and expect 
him to land on his feet."[23] This ended a disappointing stint with the 
Mariners. On May 13, 2010, Byrnes announced his retirement from Major League 
Baseball. He currently lives in Half Moon Bay, California, with his wife 
Tarah and daughter, plays slow pitch softball and golf. He earned $11 million 
in 2010.[24] During the 2006 post-season, Byrnes was an analyst for ESPN's 
Baseball Tonight show. He has also appeared on Fox's baseball pre-game 
show and The Best Damn Sports Show Period talk show. He was a guest analyst 
for the first two games of the 2006 World Series pre-game show and for 
some of the 2007 World Series on FOX Sports. During the off-season, Byrnes 
often fills in on KNBR, a San Francisco radio station. He currently resides 
with his wife Tarah, daughter Chloe and their bulldogs, Bruin, Mr. Hitch 
and Bella. During the 2007 MLB All Star Game at AT&T Park, he was in a 
kayak in McCovey Cove with Bruin during the pre-game and game itself for 
the FOX Sports broadcast. Byrnes also has had his own TV show, called "The 
Eric Byrnes Show," which aired on FSN Arizona during the Diamondbacks' 
regular season. The show featured behind-the-scenes looks at the Arizona 
Diamondbacks, as well as Byrnes' personal life. During the 2007 off-season, 
Byrnes began a weekly radio show on XM Satellite Radio, called "Hustle 
with Eric Byrnes."[25] He worked in the booth with ESPN for the 2010 College 
World Series and is now a contributor to the MLB Network. On March 18, 
2011, Byrnes was hired by KNBR to host a nightly talk show, holding the 
7-10 pm slot, as well as doing a Giants post-game show.[26] Byrnes began 
his talk show on March 23, 2011. Now Byrnes occasionally co-hosts the Mr. 
T. show with Tom Tolbert, and Ray Ratto. As of 2013, Byrnes also works
