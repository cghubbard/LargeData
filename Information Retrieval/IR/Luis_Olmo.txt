Luis Olmo (born August 11, 1919) is a former major league baseball outfielder 
and right-handed batter. Olmo played in the majors with the Brooklyn Dodgers 
(1943–45, 1949) and Boston Braves (1950–51). Olmo (birth name: Luis Francisco 
Rodríguez Olmo [note 1]) was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. He debuted with 
the Dodgers on July 18, 1943. In 57 games, he batted .303 with four home 
runs and 37 RBI. He gained regular status in the next season, batting .258 
with nine home runs and 85 RBI in 136 games. On May 18, 1945, Olmo became 
the second player (Del Bissonette on April 21, 1930 was the first) in Major 
League history to hit a bases-loaded triple and a bases-loaded home run 
(grand slam) in the same game. He added a single for good measure, only 
failing to hit a double to complete the cycle. In that season, he led the 
league in triples (13) and reached career-high numbers in batting average 
(.313), home runs (10), RBI (110), doubles (27), stolen bases (15) and 
games (141). In 1946, Olmo was among a group of players who were enticed 
to play in the Mexican League by the promise of higher salaries; they were 
suspended by Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler for jumping the major 
leagues. Two years later, Olmo was reinstated and he returned to the Dodgers, 
batting .305 in 1949 to help win the pennant. In the 1949 World Series 
against the Yankees, Olmo became the first Puerto Rican to play in a World 
Series, as well as hit a home run and get three hits in a Series game. 
After two seasons, he was dealt to the Braves. He retired at the end of 
the 1951 season. In a six-year career, Olmo batted .281 (458-for-1629) 
with 29 home runs, 208 runs, 65 doubles, 25 triples, and 33 stolen bases 
in 462 games. Olmo earned Caribbean Series MVP honors, during the 1951 
edition played in Caracas, after batting .416 and three homers, while powering 
the Cangrejeros de Santurce to the championship. He returned to the Series 
with Santurce in its 1955 title, and also played as a reinforcement for 
fourth-place Senadores de San Juan in 1952. Overall, he posted a .303 average 
with three home runs and 13 RBI in three Caribbean Series. Many Puerto 
Rican fans consider Olmo to have been as gifted as Roberto Clemente and 
Roberto Alomar, among fellow countrymen. Olmo was elected to the Caribbean 
Baseball Hall of Fame on February 6, 2004. His baseball career was featured 
in a 2008 American documentary titled "Beisbol", directed by Alan Swyer 
and narrated by Esai Morales, which covered the early influences and contributions 
of Hispanics in the game. The City of Arecibo honored Olmo by naming a 
stadium after him. Olmo is recognized as the oldest living former member
