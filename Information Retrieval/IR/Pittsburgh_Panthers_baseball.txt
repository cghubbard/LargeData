The Pittsburgh Panthers baseball is the NCAA Division I intercollegiate 
baseball program of the University of Pittsburgh, often referred to as 
"Pitt", located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pitt baseball team competes 
in the Atlantic Coast Conference and plays their home games at Charles 
L. Cost Field in the Petersen Sports Complex. It is the university's oldest 
recorded sport, dating to 1869. Prior to joining the ACC in 2013-14, Pitt 
had won both the Big East Conference regular season and Big East Tournament 
championships. The Panthers have also received four First Team All-American 
selections, and have appeared in three NCAA championships. 52 Panthers 
have been selected in the Major League Baseball Draft. Joe Jordano has 
been the head coach of Pitt baseball since 1998. Baseball has been called 
"the first game of consequence played at the University."[2] The first 
recorded game was a 21–20, five-inning win over the Eckfords of East Liberty 
in 1869. The team went undefeated until it lost to a high school team in 
1870. Although early records are sparse and incomplete, baseball at the 
university continued to be played against nearby college teams, although 
sometimes with irregular schedules, throughout the end of the 19th Century, 
as well as at the intramural level.[2] The student yearbook, The Owl, noted 
that teams fielded between the years of 1888 to 1894 were especially successful.[3] 
However, according to the student yearbook, in the early 20th century interest 
in college baseball at Pitt waned due to a lack of a proper field, strictness 
of eligibility rules, irregularity of schedules, and the rise of football 
as the dominant school sport.[2] Pitt did not field a baseball team from 
1918 to 1920, although the program was briefly resurrected under coach 
Dick Harley for four seasons which were highlighted by the play of future 
Major League Baseball pitcher Steve Swetonic, before the program again 
disappeared from 1925 to 1938.[4] The program was reestablished in 1939 
under coach Ralph Mitterling who led the team for 16 seasons and guided 
players such as future Major League pitcher Russ Kemmerer.[5] In 1955, 
legendary Pitt baseball coach Bobby Lewis took control of the program. 
Lewis, who is one of two Panthers to have his baseball jersey retired by 
the school, led the team for 36 seasons until his retirement in 1990.[5] 
During his tenure, Pitt went 438–389, garnering Lewis the most wins of 
any coach in Pitt athletics history to that point.[6] Under Lewis, Pitt 
appeared in the NCAA baseball championship twice, and finished ranked 27th 
in the final 1967 Collegiate Baseball Newspaper poll.[7] Lewis coached 
All-Americans George Schoeppner and Fred Mazurek, future long-time Major 
League professionals Doc Medich and Ken Macha, as well as other notable 
athletes such as Mike Ditka and Joe Walton.[6][8] Mark Jackson took over 
for Bobby Lewis in 1991 and quickly turned the Panthers into a contender 
in the Big East Conference, in which Pitt had begun competing in 1985. 
Jackson led the Panthers to a regular season Big East title in 1994, earning 
Big East Coach of the Year honors, and went on to win the 1995 Big East 
Conference Baseball Tournament, thus earning a bid to the NCAA Championship 
and finishing the season ranked 28th in the final Collegiate Baseball Newspaper 
poll.[9][10] His teams posted five winning seasons out of seven years at 
the helm, including three 30 or more-win seasons.[5] Notable players for 
Jackson include Jason Conti, who went on to play for five seasons in the 
Major Leagues, and Josh Tyler who won the 1994 Big East Player of the Year 
award. One of the most successful eras of Pitt baseball began with the 
hiring of Joe Jordano as coach on November 15, 1997.[11] Since coming to 
Pittsburgh, Jordano has had 38 players taken in the Major League Baseball 
Draft, 50 of his players sign professional contracts, and 36 All-Big East 
players.[12] Since 2000, Jordano's teams have produced nine All-Americans, 
20 All-region selections, six 30-win seasons, and six Big East Baseball 
Tournament appearances. Jordano earned the Big East Coach of the Year award 
in 2004 following a 38–18 season in which Pitt finished second in the conference 
standings.[13] In 2010, Pitt went 38-18 and appeared in the Top 25 polls 
of both Collegiate Baseball Newspaper[14] and Baseball America[15] for 
the first time in its history, earning Jordano the American Baseball Coaches 
Association (ABCA) East Region Coach of the Year award[16] and the Chuck 
Tanner Collegiate Baseball Manager of the Year Award.[17] On March 2, 2012, 
Jordano surpassed former head coach Bobby Lewis to become Pitt baseball's 
all-time wins leader when he earned his 403rd career victory, a 3-1 win 
at Coastal Carolina.[18][19] In 2011, the program moved into a new facility, 
Charles L. Cost Field, in the Petersen Sports Complex, from its old facility, 
Trees Field.[20] The new facilities helped to prompt Rivals.com to name 
Pitt as one of "college baseball's rising programs" heading into the 2011 
season.[21] Pitcher Corey Baker, who in 2010 had been named to the All-Big 
East First Team, and to the ABCA/Rawlings All-East Region First Team, ended 
his university career in 2011 as the Pittsburgh Panthers all-time career 
wins leader, with 24.[22][23] In the 2013 season, Pitt's last in the Big 
East Conference, the team set a record for the most wins in a single season 
(42)[24] and became nationally ranked in the Top 25 of all five major college 
baseball polls for the first time in program history, including climbing 
as high as #16 in Collegiate Baseball Newspaper.[25] Pitt moved into the 
Atlantic Coast Conference on July 1, 2013.[26] Pitt has had ten different 
players selected as All-Americans, including four first team selections. 
In addition, two Panthers have been selected as Freshman All-Americans,[27][28][29] 
and five players have been selected as an Academic All-Americans.[30][31] 
Pitt has had 32 All-East selections over its history,[12][27][32][33][34] 
and one coach, Joe Jordano, was named the ABCA East Region Coach of the 
Year in 2010.[16] Pitt has receive 69 All-Big East selections[40] along 
with conference player, pitcher, rookie, and coach of the year awards.[9][12] 
In addition, 36 Pitt players have garnered All-Big East Academic Awards 
and the team earned the Most Improved Team GPA award in 2008.[11] Pitt 
has had 52 Major League Baseball Draft selections since the draft began 
in 1965. Since 1940, 90 total players that have been drafted or signed 
to professional contracts, including 51 since 2000.[27][41][42][43] Other 
Pitt players that had Major League careers include Steve Swetonic, Robert
