The 1956 Brooklyn Dodgers edged out the Milwaukee Braves to win the National 
League title. The Dodgers again faced the New York Yankees in the World 
Series. This time they lost the series in seven games, one of which was 
a perfect game by the Yankees' Don Larsen. Don Newcombe won the NL MVP 
award and the very first Cy Young Award. He was the first pitcher to win 
the National League MVP and the Cy Young Award in the same season.[5] During 
the season, the Dodgers played seven home games at Roosevelt Stadium in 
Jersey City, New Jersey, as part of owner Walter O'Malley's continued attempts 
to pressure Brooklyn to allow him to build a new stadium in his preferred 
location at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues. The first of these games was 
on April 19.[6] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other batters
