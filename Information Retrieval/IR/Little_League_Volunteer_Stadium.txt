Little League Volunteer Stadium is a baseball stadium in South Williamsport, 
Pennsylvania. Along with Howard J. Lamade Stadium, it annually hosts the 
Little League World Series, one of the few sports events where children 
12 years old and younger take the center stage. Volunteer Stadium was built 
starting in 2000 to accommodate the growth of the Little League World Series, 
and was completed in 2001. Its approximate capacity is 5,000, almost exclusively 
in the main stands, with limited lawn seating in the outfield. Volunteer 
Stadium is used for double-elimination pool play only. All elimination 
games and consolation games are played at Lamade Stadium. In 2006, the 
home run distance was increased by 20 ft (6.1 m), from 205 ft (62 m) to 
225 ft (69 m), to all fields; the outfield wall forms one-fourth of a true 
circle. Coordinates: 41°13′53.74″N 76°58′49.45″W﻿ / ﻿41.2315944°N 76.9804028°W﻿
