Stephen Carlton Clark, Sr. (August 29, 1882 – September 17, 1960) was an 
American art collector, newspaper publisher, benefactor and founder of 
the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. He was the son of Alfred 
Corning Clark and grandson of Edward Clark, who was a founder of the Singer 
Sewing Machine Company. His brother, Robert Sterling Clark, also an art 
collector, founded the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, 
Massachusetts. Stephen Clark graduated from Yale with a Bachelor of Arts 
degree in 1903 and was awarded in 1957 an honorary degree of Doctor of 
Human Letters. and became a director of the Singer Manufacturing Company. 
He founded the Clark Foundation to further his philanthropies. In 1909, 
Stephen Clark and his brother, Edward Severin Clark, built the Otesaga 
Resort Hotel in Cooperstown, New York.[2] He was a member of the New York 
State Assembly (Otsego Co.) in 1910. In 1922 he received a Distinguished 
Service Medal for his service in World War I as a lieutenant-colonel. He 
was the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Museum of Modern Art from 
1939 to 1946, and was a director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. During 
his lifetime he served on numerous corporate boards. He died on September 
17, 1960. Stephen was survived by his wife, Susan Vanderpoel Clark (née 
Hun), sons Stephen C. Clark, Jr. and Alfred Clark. The Stephen Clark Fund, 
established in 1960 with a bequest from his estate, supports scholarships 
and stipends given at the discretion of International House of New York. 
Upon his death his will distributed many significant works of art of many 
museums. Yale, for example, received forty such paintings. The following 
year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibited the works from his bequest 
to that institution.[3] In May 2009 a lawsuit arose with a claim in reference 
to one work donated by Stephen to Yale University - Vincent van Gogh's 
"The Night Café" from 1888. Pierre Konowaloff, heir to his great-grandfather's 
estate (Ivan Morozov) alleged in a suit that "The Night Café" was taken 
by the Soviet government in 1920. It was acquired by Clark in 1933 and 
donated in 1960. Konowaloff's counterclaim suit against Yale argued that 
Yale should have questioned the propriety of Clark's purchase, and that 
the court cannot deem the university to be the painting's rightful owner. 
"Stephen C. Clark either had actual knowledge, or reasonably should have 
known, that Russia had no legal title to the painting when he sought to 
acquire it in 1933."[4] In September 2011 the District Court in Manhattan 
granted the Met’s motion to dismiss the suit brought by Pierre Konowaloff[5] 
'The Court found that Mr. Konowaloff’s claim would require it to question 
the validity of the Soviet Union’s taking Cézanne’s portrait of his wife 
as part of its nationalization of private property after the Russian Revolution, 
which the Court, under longstanding precedent of the “act of state” doctrine, 
refused to do. Under that doctrine, the acts of a sovereign government 
are legitimate, official acts.'[5] Portrait of de Heer Bodolphe (1643)
