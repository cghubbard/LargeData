The 1972 Oakland Athletics season involved the A's winning the American 
League West with a record of 93 wins and 62 losses. In the playoffs, they 
defeated the Detroit Tigers in a five-game ALCS, followed by a seven-game 
World Series, in which they defeated the Cincinnati Reds for their first 
World Championship since 1930, when the club was in Philadelphia. In 1972, 
the A's began wearing solid green or solid gold jerseys, with contrasting 
white pants, at a time when most other teams wore all-white uniforms at 
home and all-grey ones on the road. Similar to more colorful amateur softball 
uniforms, they were considered a radical departure for their time. Furthermore, 
in conjunction with a Moustache Day promotion, Finley offered $500 to any 
player who grew a moustache by Father's Day, at a time when every other 
team forbade facial hair. When Father's Day arrived, every member of the 
team collected a bonus.[citation needed] The nickname "A's" has long been 
used interchangeably with "Athletics", dating to the team's early days 
when headline writers wanted a way to shorten the name. Starting in 1972, 
the team nickname was officially "Oakland A's." The Commissioner's Trophy, 
given out annually to the winner of baseball's World Series, still listed 
the team's name as the "Oakland Athletics" on the gold-plated pennant representing 
the Oakland franchise. According to Bill Libby's Book, Charlie O and the 
Angry A's, owner Charlie O. Finley banned the word "Athletics" from the 
club's name because he felt that name was too closely associated with former 
Philadelphia Athletics owner Connie Mack, and he wanted the name "Oakland 
A's" to become just as closely associated with himself. The name also vaguely 
suggested the name of the old minor league Oakland Oaks, which were alternatively 
called the "Acorns". [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]

league pennant since 1931 and faced the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. 
The A's seven-game victory over the heavily favored Reds gave the team 
its first World Series Championship since 1930. Of the four wins against 
the Reds, three of them occurred in Cincinnati, and all four Series victories 
were by a single run. Gene Tenace hit four home runs and drove in nine 
runs to power the A's offense, and was named the series Most Valuable Player.
