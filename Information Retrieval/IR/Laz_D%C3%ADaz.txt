Lazaro Antonio Díaz Sr. (born March 29, 1963) is an umpire in Major League 
Baseball. He joined the American League's full-time staff in 1999, and 
has worked in both major leagues since 2000. His professional umpiring 
career began after he attended the Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School in 1991. 
He worked his way up to the International League for the 1995 season. Díaz 
was one of the 22 umpires promoted to the major leagues in the wake of 
the Major League Umpires Association's mass-resignation strategy in July 
1999. Prior to his professional umpiring career, he served in the Marine 
Corps Reserves. Díaz's hand-to-hand combat skills were displayed on the 
baseball diamond when he was attacked by an intoxicated fan while umpiring 
first base in a game at Comiskey Park in April 2003.[1] The fan, Eric Dybas, 
a self-described Cubs fan, had attended a game at Wrigley Field earlier 
in the day and had been drinking all day.[2] Laz easily stifled the attack, 
and the fan (Eric Dybas) was later sentenced to up to 180 days in jail 
and one month of probation for aggravated battery.[3] Díaz was the second 
base umpire when Barry Bonds broke Hank Aaron's career home run record. 
On July 23, 2009, Díaz was the third base umpire for Mark Buehrle's perfect 
game. He has worked the World Series in 2007, the American League Championship 
Series in 2009, 2015, and 2016, and the Division Series in 2002, 2006, 
2007, 2013, and 2014. He also umpired the All-Star Game in 2000 and 2010. 
Díaz is featured in Pepsi commercials with the Detroit Tigers' Johnny Damon, 
the Minnesota Twins' Joe Mauer and broadcaster Gary Thorne. On Sunday March 
7, 2010, Laz Díaz was inducted to the Cuban Hall of Fame. During a game 
on May 30, 2012, Díaz got into an unusual argument with New York Yankees 
catcher Russell Martin. According to Martin, Díaz punished the catcher 
for disputing the strike zone by not letting him throw new baseballs out 
to the pitcher (a preference of Martin's) and claiming that this ability 
had to be "earned." MLB Executive VP for Baseball Operations Joe Torre 
spoke to Díaz and Martin about the incident, but Martin said he does not 
expect any disciplinary action for either man.[4] MLB selected Diaz to 
officiate its 2014 Opening Series at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Sydney,
