Thomas Alan Grieve (born March 4, 1948) is a former Major League Baseball 
player. He played from 1970–79 for the Washington Senators, Texas Rangers, 
New York Mets and St. Louis Cardinals. Nicknamed "TAG", which are his initials, 
Grieve's best season was 1976 with the Rangers when he hit .255, belted 
20 home runs and had 81 runs batted in. On December 8, 1977, he was involved 
in a rare four-team trade that involved the New York Mets, Atlanta Braves, 
Pittsburgh Pirates and the Texas Rangers. Grieve and a player to be named 
later (Ken Henderson) were sent to the Mets, who also received Willie Montañez 
from the Braves. Texas sent Adrian Devine, Tommy Boggs and Eddie Miller 
to Atlanta and Bert Blyleven to the Pirates. The Pirates sent Al Oliver 
and Nelson Norman to the Rangers, who also got Jon Matlack from the Mets. 
Finally, the Mets sent John Milner to the Pirates. Primarily an outfielder 
and a designated hitter, the right-handed batter finished his career with 
a .249 average, 65 homers and 254 RBIs in 670 games. In between, Grieve 
posted five solid seasons in the Venezuelan Winter League while playing 
for the Águilas del Zulia, Leones del Caracas and Tiburones de La Guaira 
clubs between 1971 and 1979. According to his own words, he says that any 
player who skips winter ball does themselves a disservice because they’re 
too lazy.[1] After retiring as a player at the end of the 1979 season, 
Grieve joined the Rangers' front office, and did his first work as a color 
commentator for Rangers television broadcasts during the 1980 season. In 
1984 Grieve became general manager of the Rangers, and served in that capacity 
until 1994. In December 1988 Grieve made one of the best trades in team 
history, acquiring Rafael Palmeiro and Jamie Moyer from the Chicago Cubs 
for Mitch Williams. That same winter he acquired future batting champion 
Julio Franco. However, he also traded away several future stars, including 
Sammy Sosa in 1989 and Robb Nen in 1993. Grieve currently is a broadcaster 
for the Rangers televised games. Since 1995, Grieve has served consistently 
as the color commentator for the Texas Rangers, which is the longest tenure 
of any TV broadcaster in Texas Rangers club history. He sits in the booth 
alongside play-by-play announcer and former Kansas City Royal Steve Busby. 
The Grieves were the first father-and-son combo to be selected in the first 
round of the MLB draft. Tom was chosen sixth overall by the Senators in 
1966 while Ben was the second overall selection by Oakland in 1994. Ben 
Grieve played 976 games for the Oakland A's, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Milwaukee 
Brewers and the Chicago Cubs. Tom Grieve was inducted into the Texas Rangers
