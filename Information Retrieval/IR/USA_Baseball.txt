USA Baseball was founded in 1978, and is the governing body for amateur 
baseball in the United States of America. It is a member of the United 
States Olympic Committee (USOC) and organizes the United States national 
baseball team. In 2000, USA Baseball was named the USOC Team of the Year. 
USA Baseball organizes various teams composed of High School, College, 
and Professional baseball players competing nationally and internationally. 
In the 1984 and 1988 Olympics, baseball was a demonstration sport, but 
Team USA captured a silver and gold respectively. During the 1996 games 
in Atlanta, Georgia, the team won the bronze medal. In 2000, for the first 
time ever, the team was composed of minor league players. Guided by Tommy 
Lasorda, the team defeated two-time champion Cuba to capture the gold medal. 
However, the team failed to qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics as they 
lost a qualifying tournament that saw them lose to Mexico in an elimination 
game during the quarter-final round. The USA Baseball National Team is 
made up of the top freshman and sophomore players of collegiate baseball. 
Each year the team embarks upon the Red, White and Blue Tour to play exhibition 
games against various teams in the United States, including an annual tour 
of the New England Collegiate Baseball League. The tour also features traditional 
match-ups against Japan and Canada. The National Team featured many MLB 
players like Mark McGwire, Nomar Garciaparra, Troy Glaus, Mark Prior, Jason 
Giambi, and Adam Everett. USA Baseball also fields the Junior National 
Team (18-under) and the Youth National Team (15-under). It also organizes 
the USA Baseball Championships and awards the Golden Spikes Award to the 
amateur baseball player of the year. Since 1998, USA Baseball has been 
selecting teams of Professional-level minor league players to represent 
the United States in various International competitions including the IBAF 
World Cup, IBAF Intercontinental Cup, Pan Am Games and Olympic Regional 
qualifying events. These players are hand selected by USA Baseball Directors 
from either affiliated MLB Minor League teams or Independent League teams. 
Each June, USA Baseball sends at-large teams to the national all-stars 
tournament — the USA Baseball Tournament of Stars; its predecessor was 
the National Amateur All-Star Baseball Tournament (NAABT). The tournament 
features the top 16- to 18-year-old players from various baseball organizations, 
including the American Amateur Baseball Congress (AABC), American Legion, 
Babe Ruth Baseball, Dixie Baseball, National Amateur Baseball Federation 
(NABF), PONY baseball, Major League Baseball's Reviving Baseball in Inner 
Cities (RBI), and at-large teams from USA Baseball.[1] The first USA Baseball 
women's national team was selected in 2004 to participate in the 2004 Women's 
World Series in Japan and in the 2004 Women's World Cup in Edmonton. The 
women's national team won the Silver Medal at the Women's World Series 
and brought home the Gold Medal from the 2004 *Women's World Cup. In 2006, 
the USA Baseball women's national team repeated as the Gold Medalist defeating 
Japan 13–11 in Taipei, Taiwan. In June 2005, Major League Baseball announced 
the formation of the World Baseball Classic, a 16 nation international 
competition to be held in March 2006 for the first time. A month after 
this announcement, the IOC voted to eliminate baseball from the 2012 London 
Olympic games, leaving the WBC as the only international tournament to 
feature American professionals. USA Baseball annually awards the Richard 
W. "Dick" Case Player of the Year Award, which was simply known as the 
"USA Baseball Player of the Year Award" until 2003.[2][3] It votes it every 
year to USA Baseball's top player.[2] The award is named after USA Baseball's 
past founding executive director and CEO.[2] Recent award winners have 
included pitcher Huston Street in 2003, first baseman Ryan Zimmerman in 
2004, first baseman Ryan Shealy in 2005, catcher and first baseman J.P. 
Arencibia in 2006, second baseman Jayson Nix in 2007, pitcher Stephen Strasburg 
in 2008, first baseman Justin Smoak in 2009, shortstop Alex Bregman in 
2010, outfielder Albert Almora in 2011, catcher Reese McGuire in 2012, 
pitcher Carlos Rodon in 2013, and outfielder Brice Tarang in 2014.[2][4][5][6]
