Cameron Keith Maybin (born April 4, 1987) is an American professional baseball 
outfielder for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He has also played in MLB for the Detroit Tigers, Florida Marlins, 
San Diego Padres, and Atlanta Braves. He was the tenth overall pick in 
the 2005 MLB draft by the Tigers, and debuted with them in 2007. Maybin 
played high school baseball for T.C. Roberson High School in Asheville, 
North Carolina. As a freshman, he led his team to a state title and was 
named the tournament's Most Valuable Player.[1] Joe Hayden, his manager 
with the Midland Redskins, said he had "the same instincts in the outfield 
and at the plate" as Ken Griffey, Jr., who Hayden also coached in the Connie 
Mack Division, an amateur baseball league for players 18 and younger.[1] 
The summer before his senior season, Maybin won the Connie Mack batting 
title and the 2004 Connie Mack World Series MVP award.[2] Maybin was also 
named the 2004 Baseball America Youth Player of the Year.[2] After graduating 
from high school, Maybin awaited the Major League draft. In their pre-draft 
rankings, Baseball America tabbed him as the most promising available outfielder 
and the third-best hitting prospect overall.[3] He fell to the Tigers in 
tenth spot in the 2005 draft, in part due to speculation he'd be difficult 
to sign.[4] He signed in September for a $2.65 million bonus.[5] In 2006, 
Maybin played his first professional season for the Class-A West Michigan 
Whitecaps, helping them win the Midwest League championship. He had a batting 
average of .304, hit nine home runs and stole 27 bases. He was chosen to 
participate in the All-Star Futures Game.[6] In late November 2006, Cameron 
was given the Class A Playoff Performer Award by MiLB.com.[7] He began 
the 2007 season with the Lakeland Flying Tigers of the High-A Florida State 
League.[8] On August 9, 2007, Maybin was promoted from the Single-A Lakeland 
Flying Tigers to the Double-A Erie Seawolves where he played six games 
before his call up to the Major League. Maybin was consistently ranked 
as the Tigers top minor league prospect while in the organization.[8][9][10] 
Maybin also played in the minors in 2008 for the Marlins Double-A affiliate 
Carolina Mudcats where he hit .277 with 13 home runs, 49 RBIs and 21 stolen 
bases to go along with a hefty 124 strikeouts in 390 at-bats (108 games). 
Maybin was called up to the Tigers on August 17, 2007, and made his Major 
League debut that day, going 0-4.[11][12] He was the youngest player in 
the American League (20 years old). In his second game, August 18, 2007, 
Maybin picked up his first career hit, (a single), and first career home 
run, both off of Roger Clemens. During his next plate appearance, he was 
hit by a Clemens fastball. Thus, Maybin received his first Major League 
hit, home run and hit-by-pitch in the same game.[13] On December 5, 2007, 
the Tigers traded Maybin, Andrew Miller, Mike Rabelo, Dallas Trahern, Eulogio 
De La Cruz, and Burke Badenhop to the Florida Marlins for Dontrelle Willis 
and Miguel Cabrera.[14] On September 16, 2008, Maybin was called up to 
the Florida Marlins. He went 16 for 32 (.500 average) with 4 stolen bases 
in 8 Major League games. In 2009, Maybin was the starting center fielder 
for the Florida Marlins when they faced the Washington Nationals on Opening 
Day. Maybin was sent down to the AAA New Orleans Zephyrs on May 10 after 
a poor start to the 2009 season, hitting .202 in 22 starts. Maybin was 
called back up to the Marlins on August 31 after hitting .319 in Triple-A 
and finished out the season with the big league club.[15] Maybin again 
began 2010 as the Marlins starting center fielder, but was sent to Triple-A 
New Orleans on June 17 after hitting .225 with the club.[15] He hit .340 
in the minors and rejoined the Marlins on August 24. In his final season 
with the Marlins, Maybin finished the year hitting .234 with 9 stolen bases 
over 82 total games. Following the 2010 season, Maybin was traded to the 
Padres for Ryan Webb and Edward Mujica.[16] In 2011, he became the ninth 
player in Padres history to steal 40 bases.[17] He hit .264 with nine home 
runs and 40 RBIs and was the Padres' 2011 nominee for the Hank Aaron Award.[18] 
The San Diego Union-Tribune praised Maybin's defense and called his acquisition 
"one of the best trades in Padres history" and named him the team's MVP.[19] 
MLB.com wrote that his defense in center field was "Gold Glove-caliber".[18] 
On March 3, 2012, Maybin and the Padres agreed on a 5-year deal worth $25 
million with a club option for a 6th year.[20] Maybin began the 2012 season 
in a prolonged slump, hitting .212 in the first half of the season, but 
he rebounded in the second half, batting .283, and finished the year with 
a .243/.306/.349 batting line and 26 stolen bases. He removed a high leg 
kick from his swing in July and credited the adjustment with his improved 
results.[21] Maybin was also hampered during the season by a lingering 
sore wrist that caused him to miss a handful of starts in late May and 
in July[22] and a sore Achilles' tendon that cost him time in September.[23] 
Maybin made 136 starts in center field on the year. Maybin lost most of 
the 2013 season to injuries. He started 10 games in center field before 
going on the disabled list in mid-April with inflammation and an impingement 
in his right wrist. He returned for 4 games in early June before he tore 
a posterior cruciate ligament in his right knee diving for a ball.[24] 
While rehabbing the knee, Maybin decided to have surgery on the wrist in 
September as it continued to trouble him.[25] The surgery found loose particles 
and loose cartilage and a recovery time of 8–12 weeks was expected.[26] 
On July 23, 2014, Maybin was suspended 25 games for using amphetamines, 
a violation of the Major League Baseball drug policy. He said the failed 
test was the result of treatment for attention deficit disorder (ADD), 
but added: "I understand that I must accept responsibility for this mistake".[27][28] 
Maybin was activated from the restricted list on August 20, 2014.[29] On 
April 5, 2015, Maybin was traded along with Carlos Quentin, Matt Wisler, 
Jordan Paroubeck, and a draft pick to the Atlanta Braves for Craig Kimbrel 
and Melvin Upton, Jr..[30] During the 2015 season, Maybin hit .267 with 
65 runs scored, 18 doubles, two triples, 10 home runs and 59 RBIs in 141 
games. He finished 10th in the National League with 23 stolen bases. On 
November 20, 2015, the Braves traded Maybin to the Tigers in exchange for 
Ian Krol and Gabe Speier.[31] On March 3, 2016, the Tigers announced that 
Maybin suffered a non-displaced fracture in his wrist that will sideline 
him for at least 4-6 weeks. The fracture occurred when Maybin was hit by 
a 95-mph fastball from New York Yankees pitcher Luis Severino in a spring 
training game.[32] On May 16, 2016, Maybin was recalled by the Tigers following 
his rehab assignment with the Toledo Mud Hens.[33] Maybin was named the 
American League Co-Player of the Week, along with fellow Tigers teammate 
Miguel Cabrera, who he had been traded for 8 years ago, for the week of 
May 16–22. Maybin hit .600/.652/.750 with one home run, five RBIs and four 
stolen bases in his first six games in his second stint with the Tigers.[34] 
On June 30, 2016, Maybin was a key player in the Tigers dramatic eight-run 
ninth inning against the Tampa Bay Rays. With the Tigers trailing 7–2 entering 
the top of the ninth, Maybin led off the inning with a single, and later 
finished the rally with a three-run double, helping the Tigers to a 10–7 
win.[35] Maybin was placed on the 15-day disabled list August 4, having 
sprained his thumb diving for a ball in an August 3 game. He was activated 
on August 21, and started in center field against the Boston Red Sox.[36] 
Maybin hit .315 for the 2016 Tigers, with 4 home runs, 5 triples and a 
team-leading 15 stolen bases, but injuries limited him to just 92 games. 
After the 2016 season, the Tigers traded Maybin to the Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim for Victor Alcántara. The Angels subsequently exercised the 
$9 million option on Maybin's contract for the 2017 season.[37] Maybin 
is a cousin of former NFL linebacker Aaron Maybin, NBA guard Rashad McCants,[38] 
WNBA guard/forward Rashanda McCants and a third cousin of Canadian Football
