The U2 360° Tour was a worldwide concert tour by rock band U2.[1] Launched 
in support of the group's 2009 album No Line on the Horizon, the tour visited 
stadiums from 2009 through 2011. It was named for a stage configuration 
that allowed the audience to almost completely surround the stage.[2] To 
accommodate this, a massive four-legged structure nicknamed "The Claw" 
was built above the stage, with the sound system and a cylindrical, expanding 
video screen on top of it. U2 claimed that the tour would be "the first 
time a band has toured in stadiums with such a unique and original structure."[3] 
In an era of declining music sales, analysts expected U2 360° to be a major 
source of income for the band.[4] Every date of the tour sold out, many 
within minutes of tickets going on sale. To accommodate the time required 
to assemble and transport "The Claw" between tour dates, three separate 
stage structures were required on tour. The 360-degree production increased 
the capacity of venues by up to 25%, leading to attendance records at over 
60 venues. Various themes were incorporated into the shows; portions of 
the concerts featured outer space themes, due to "The Claw's" resemblance 
to a spaceship. Pre-recorded messages from the International Space Station 
were displayed during the shows, as were sociopolitical statements from 
Desmond Tutu and Aung San Suu Kyi. The setlists were adjusted for each 
year of the tour; for the 2010 shows, unreleased songs were debuted live, 
while for 2011 legs, the group performed more 1990s songs to mark the 20th 
anniversary of the release of Achtung Baby. Comprising three legs[5] and 
110 shows, the tour began on 30 June 2009 in Barcelona, Spain and concluded 
on 30 July 2011 in Moncton, Canada. It twice visited Europe and North America, 
while making stops in South America, Africa, and Oceania. The 2010 North 
American leg of the tour was postponed until the following year after frontman 
Bono suffered a serious back injury. U2 won Billboard Touring Awards for 
Top Tour and Top Draw of 2010 and 2011, and for Top Boxscore at a single 
venue in 2009 for shows at Croke Park in Dublin. A 2009 show at the Rose 
Bowl in Pasadena, near Los Angeles, United States was filmed for the concert 
video U2360° at the Rose Bowl and was streamed live over YouTube; the concert 
set a new US attendance record for a single headlining act.[6] The tour 
was generally well received by critics and fans. By its conclusion, U2 
360° had set records for the highest-grossing concert tour with $736 million 
in ticket sales, and for the highest-attended tour with over 7.2 million 
tickets sold. Willie Williams, who has worked on every U2 tour since the 
1982–1983 War Tour, was again a designer for this tour;[7] Mark Fisher 
served as the architect.[3] Williams had been toying with ideas for 360-degree 
stadium staging for U2 for a number of years,[8] and presented sketches 
of a four-legged design to the group near the end of their Vertigo Tour 
in 2006.[9] The inspiration for the "spaceship-on-four-legs" design, nicknamed 
"the Claw", came from the landmark Theme Building at Los Angeles International 
Airport.[9] Early reports referred to it as the Kiss the Future Tour, though 
the name was later changed.[10] The tour featured a 360-degree configuration, 
with the stage being placed closer to the center of the stadium's field 
than usual.[7] The stage design featured a large four-legged steel structure 
that held the speaker system and cylindrical video screen and hovered above 
the performance area. The stage was surrounded by a circular ramp, which 
connected to the stage by rotating bridges. Fans with general admission 
tickets could be placed both outside the ramp as well as between the ramp 
and stage. The stage had no defined front or back and was surrounded by 
the audience.[7] The stage design was able to increase the venues' capacities 
by about 15–20%.[11] Tiered football stadiums were preferred venues in 
this scheme, compared to flat fields or baseball stadiums,[7] although 
a few of the latter added to the routing. As with many large-scale tours 
of its era, the U2 360° Tour had both the workforce and the revenues associated 
with a medium-sized company.[4] The stages were built by the Belgian company 
Stageco along with the U.S.-based company Enerpac. Each stage deployed 
high-pressure, state-of-the-art hydraulic systems. These were used for 
the first time ever to assemble and dismantle the high tonnage structure. 
Stageco designed a unique system, based on Enerpac's Synchronous Lift System, 
to raise the modular construction to a height of 30 metres in an efficient 
and effective manner.[12][13] The steel structure was 51 metres (167 feet) 
tall (doubling the size of the stadium set for The Rolling Stones' A Bigger 
Bang Tour, the previous record holder), was able to hold up to 200 tonnes 
underneath it, and required 120 trucks to transport each of the three sets 
constructed to support the tour.[9][14] Each leg of the structure contained 
its own sound system.[9] The cost of each structure was between £15 million 
and £20 million ($23 million and $31 million, respectively).[15] As a result, 
the tour was heavily insured.[4] The size of the stage led to some problems 
with its construction in certain venues. The band paid $2 million to raise 
the HD video screen in Cowboys Stadium for their concert in Arlington, 
and paid $3 million to expand the Hippodrome de Montréal into a temporary 
stadium for their concert in Montreal.[16][17] The 360° tour crew consisted 
of 137 touring production crew supplemented by over 120 hired locally.[18][19] 
Daily costs of the production were approximately $750,000, not including 
the stage construction; the majority of this came from truck rentals, transportation, 
and staff wages.[20] The tour was not expected to break even until the 
conclusion of the second leg.[20] "The show is an unlikely fusion of the 
two extremes of U2's tours – the technological overload of 1992-93's Zoo 
TV and the no-frills, bare-stage Elevation Tour." When the tour was announced, 
U2 guitarist The Edge said of the show's design: "It's hard to come up 
with something that's fundamentally different, but we have, I think, on 
this tour. Where we're taking our production will never have been seen 
before by anybody, and that's an amazing thing to be able to say. For a 
band like U2 that really thrives on breaking new ground, it's a real thrill."[10] 
Lead singer Bono said the design was intended to overcome the staid traditional 
appearance of outdoor concerts where the stage was dominated by speaker 
stacks on either side: "We have some magic, and we've got some beautiful 
objects we're going to take around the world, and we're inside that object."[22] 
He also said that the group's goal was for the show to not be too choreographed.[23] 
Williams said the goal is to establish a physical proximity: "The band 
is just sitting in the palm of the audience's hand."[9] At the conclusion 
of the tour, the intent was to leave the three structures in different 
parts of the globe and turn them into permanent concert venues.[14] An 
auction of the stages was planned following the last concert.[24] The transforming 
video screen was designed by Mark Fisher in a collaboration with Chuck 
Hoberman and Frederic Opsomer. The screen was fabricated by Opsomer's company 
Innovative Designs of Belgium, using LED pixels manufactured by Barco. 
The screen was purchased and rented to the tour by XL Video. It is made 
up of elongated hexagonal segments mounted on a multiple pantograph system, 
which enables it to "open up" or spread apart vertically as an effect during 
the concerts.[25] The video screen is composed of over one million pieces: 
411,000 pixels, 320,000 fasteners, 150,000 machined pieces, and 30,000 
cables are needed to create the visual display at each concert.[26] The 
screen is mounted on a cabled pulley system to enable the entire screen 
and pantograph system to move lower and closer to the band. The automation 
for the screen deployment was provided by Kinesys UK.[27] The LED segments 
of the screen are weather-resistant.[18] "Producing this structure was 
a challenge, but the effect has been great. It dwarfs the stadium, it makes 
the stage look clean and breaks down the barrier between band and crowd. 
Having invested in this technology, I think it's a game changer. I don't 
know what we'll do next time, but these cleaner stages in stadiums are 
the way to go." U2 announced that it would purchase carbon offsets to take 
into consideration the environmental impact of the large production, which 
has been estimated to be up to 65,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide; approximately 
the same amount that would be emitted in flying a passenger plane 34 million 
miles.[9][29] In addition to the carbon offsets, the band also set up a 
page on PickupPal so that people could carpool to concerts in an attempt 
to lower the carbon footprint.[30] Additionally they launched a fan travel 
carbon offset program in partnership with Offset Options.[31] Most of the 
carbon emissions are a result of transporting the three stage structures 
across Europe and North America.[29] An environmental consultant to carbonfootprint.com 
noted that to offset the tour's 2009 emissions, the band would have to 
plant over 20,000 trees.[29] In an interview with BBC Radio, The Edge reiterated 
that U2 were offsetting their carbon emissions, also stating, "We'd love 
to have some alternative to big trucks bringing the stuff around but there 
just isn't one."[32] Load-out of the massive set from venues took as much 
as 3 1⁄2 days. Sound and light equipment was packed into the fleet of trucks 
first during the four hours following the concert; the remainder of the 
time was spent deconstructing the steel structures making up the stage 
using four cranes.[33] The extensive amount of time it took to assemble 
and disassemble the stage interfered with the development of the schedule 
for the 2010 Major League Baseball season.[34] U2 was also forced to reschedule 
what would have been their final Giants Stadium concert, when the NFL changed 
the start time of a New York Jets game, and load-out time from the concert 
a day and a half prior would have been insufficient.[35] The tour was U2's 
first under their 12-year deal with Live Nation.[11] It was sponsored by 
BlackBerry,[22] in a move that broke U2's prior relationship with Apple 
Inc. and opened possibilities for collaborations between U2 and Research 
In Motion on mobile music experiences.[36] Lead singer Bono said of the 
new relationship, "I'm very excited about this. Research in Motion is going 
to give us what Apple wouldn't: access to their labs and their people so 
we can do something really spectacular."[37] The explicit corporate sponsorship 
of a tour was a first for the group, and was due to the anticipated production 
costs being higher than for any previous U2 tour.[9] The first commercials 
for a new Blackberry application, called the "U2 Mobile App", began airing 
in early July 2009 against the song "I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy 
Tonight"; the application allows the user to listen to the album No Line 
on the Horizon, contains a news section which features updates about the 
tour, and an interactive section that allows the sharing of images and 
enables the user to see their position during a concert relative to the 
band and other application users.[38] Models of the stage were added to 
Google Earth approximately a week before the scheduled concert took place; 
tour architect Mark Fisher stated, "We thought it would be interesting 
to put up on Google Earth a piece of portable architecture."[39] A category 
of stage-close seats called "The Red Zone" was created to be sold by an 
auction process, at prices estimated at up to €1,000 ($1,300).[40] All 
proceeds are to be donated by U2 members to charity, with The Global Fund 
to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria expected to receive much of it.[40] 
Approximately €9 million ($11 million) in U2 360° Tour profits is expected 
to go to charity.[40] The band asked fans to bring masks of Aung San Suu 
Kyi to concerts and wear them during performances of "Walk On" in her support; 
the song was originally written for Suu Kyi.[41] The tour was subject to 
minor criticisms, at both the events surrounding the opening concerts in 
Barcelona, and the concerts in Dublin. When rehearsing for the tour in 
Barcelona, residents of the city complained about the band's noise after 
10 pm, which was the time until which the city allowed the band to rehearse.[42] 
The setup of the band's stage for the Croke Park concerts in Dublin was 
criticised by fans for only allowing seating around part of the circular-shaped 
stage, taking away from the 360° seating configuration that was used at 
other venues. One fan claimed that only 270° of seating around the stage 
was being utilised for the three Dublin concerts, and that there was no 
reason that the stage could not be placed in the middle of the venue.[43] 
Additional criticisms about the Croke Park shows arose from about 80 Dublin 
citizens, who protested against the Dublin City Council for allowing the 
band's crew to dismantle the stage in the middle of the night following 
the three concerts, due to the loud noises caused by the crew. The protest 
blocked several crew trucks from exiting the venue, putting the tour behind 
schedule, and tour promoter MCD Productions delivered a letter to the protesters 
informing them that they could be sued for any of the tour's financial 
losses due to the protest.[44] In addition to the loudness of the band's 
crew, the Dublin City Council decided to withhold the band's €80,000 ($104,000) 
bond, after breaking the 75 decibel maximum volume at all three of the 
Dublin concerts.[45] Like most concerts, tour venues have benefited from 
hosting concerts. North Carolina State University's agreement with Live 
Nation resulted in $166,000 in parking proceeds and $175,858 food and beverage 
concessions. Additionally Live Nation agreed to pay for replacing the sod 
on the football field where the stage and floor seating was located up 
to a cost of $250,000.[46] The initial tour dates were announced in March 
2009.[3] U2 played 44 shows in that year.[11] The tour began in Barcelona 
on 30 June and played in Europe through 22 August 2009.[11] The North American 
leg of the tour began on 12 September 2009 in Chicago followed by two nights 
in Toronto and ended on 28 October 2009 in Vancouver.[11] The band played 
in Europe in 2010 following the postponement of the second North American 
leg until 2011. They finished 2010 by playing Australia and New Zealand 
in November and December. There were multiple shows in each city making 
it the largest stadium tour of Australia in the band's history.[47] U2 
manager Paul McGuinness confessed anxiety over initial ticket sales taking 
place during the late 2000s recession.[10] Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. said, 
"Will we sell it out? Who knows? Will the economic situation have an impact? 
Probably. But that's not going to stop us."[9] Bono said, "I want to put 
on an extraordinary show, but I’d like to own my house when it's over."[48] 
The tour featured a tiered pricing system for tickets; the most expensive 
ticket being slightly higher in price than the last tour, but the cheapest 
tickets, the general admission tickets, being lower.[11] Playing larger 
capacity venues allowed the band to price tickets more conservatively and 
subsidise less expensive tickets with costlier ones.[9] In the US, field 
level tickets were priced at $55, and approximately 10,000 tickets per 
show were priced at $30. The price points were $30, $55, and depending 
on the market, $90–95 and $250.[11] McGuinness said, "We have worked very 
hard to ensure that U2 fans can purchase a great-priced ticket with a guaranteed 
great view."[49] Tickets for European shows first went on sale in mid-March, 
with high demand. Shows in Gothenburg, Amsterdam and Milan sold out reasonably 
fast, with second dates being added in each city;[50] those also sold out 
quickly.[51] In The Netherlands, demand rendered all of KPN's 0900 paid 
service numbers unreachable.[52] The nearly 90,000 tickets for the opening 
concert in Barcelona were sold in 54 minutes, establishing a new record 
for concerts in Spain.[53] The tour set a record by selling 650,000 tickets 
in seven hours.[23] Regarding the quick sellout of two Croke Park shows 
in Dublin, Bono said: "It's overwhelming, really. It's a very big deal 
for us to sell-out our hometown at such speed, it's unbelievable. ... We 
don't take anything for granted."[23] Fans from all around the world travelled 
to Ireland for the band's hometown shows, leading the Gaelic Athletic Association 
to close their museum in Croke Park for the duration of the events due 
to fears over security and excessive demand.[54] The Croke Park shows later 
won Top Boxscore at the 2009 Billboard Touring Awards.[55] The first North 
American tickets went on sale in late March. Fans who purchased general 
admission tickets were given seating closest to the stage on a first-come, 
first-served basis.[11] Presales were held for U2.com subscribers, with 
those holding membership the longest getting the first chance to purchase 
tickets.[56] Sales were strong, with initial dates in Chicago and outside 
Boston and New York selling out within minutes once the public sale began, 
and with second shows being added at each venue.[57] Due to the higher 
capacity of the 360 degree configuration, the shows often set records for 
the largest concert attendance at each venue;[57] tour director Craig Evans 
claims the tour set attendance records for 60 different venues.[58] Two 
of the U2 360° Tour's concerts remain in the top five highest-attended 
single concerts in the United States ever, with the 25 October performance 
in Pasadena, California, setting the record at 97,014 attendees.[6] The 
high US demand for tickets for the tour, and the difficulty which some 
fans had in getting them, brought attention to rapidity with which tickets 
turned up on the higher-priced secondary market.[59] Some tickets were 
being resold on the secondary market for prices of up to $7,500.[60] Additionally, 
pre-sale passwords were being sold on eBay for bids of up to $400.[60] 
Although some artists were known to be holding back tickets from general 
sale and delivering them straight into the secondary market, Live Nation 
said that U2 did not engage in this practice.[59] Bono sustained an injury 
to his back during preparation for the North American third leg of the 
tour, the damage to which included sciatica, a ligament tear, a herniated 
disc, and partial paralysis of his lower leg and resulted in the need for 
emergency spine surgery at Ludwig Maximilians-University Hospital in Munich.[61][62] 
Following the surgery, Live Nation announced that the opening concert in 
Salt Lake City, which had been scheduled to take place on 3 June 2010, 
would be postponed to a later date, with other dates also potentially being 
affected.[63] His doctors, who included noted sports physician Hans-Wilhelm 
Müller-Wohlfahrt, then said Bono had a good prognosis but would need eight 
weeks of physical rehabilitation,[62] and McGuinness and Live Nation announced 
that the entire North American leg was being postponed and would be rescheduled 
into 2011.[64][65] McGuinness stated, "Our biggest and I believe best tour 
has been interrupted and we're all devastated. For a performer who lives 
to be on stage, this is more than a blow. He [Bono] feels robbed of the 
chance to do what he does best and feels like he has badly let down the 
band and their audience."[64] On 13 July 2010, the rescheduled concert 
dates were announced for 2011,[66] beginning 11 May in Mexico City, Mexico, 
and ending 30 July in Moncton, Canada.[67] Bono apologised for the inconvenience 
to fans over their affected travel plans, but noted that it had given the 
band the opportunity to record new material in the studio which U2 were 
considering playing live.[66] Each concert of the U2 360° Tour contained 
between 22 and 26 songs. Two songs played over the public address system 
preceded the band's arrival on stage—David Bowie's "Space Oddity" and an 
outtake from the No Line on the Horizon sessions called "Soon" (previously 
titled "Kingdom of Your Love").[21] The opening five tracks were identical 
each night on the first leg; "Breathe" opened and was followed by "No Line 
on the Horizon", "Get on Your Boots", "Magnificent", and "Beautiful Day". 
The next few tracks featured the most variation of the setlist. "I Still 
Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" was played frequently, while early 
concerts featured a selection from "Angel of Harlem", "In a Little While", 
"Desire", and "Party Girl". Concerts later on included "Mysterious Ways", 
"Until the End of the World", "New Year's Day", and "Stuck in a Moment 
You Can't Get Out Of". "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)", "Elevation, and "Electrical 
Storm" were played on rare occasions, and "One", which usually closed the 
main set, was sometimes performed about half-way through. The rest of the 
setlist had little variation. "Unknown Caller" was played most nights, 
and was followed by "The Unforgettable Fire", "City of Blinding Lights", 
and "Vertigo". The remix arrangement of "I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy 
Tonight" was performed next, featuring Larry Mullen, Jr. walking around 
the outer stage playing a djembe,[68] followed by "Sunday Bloody Sunday", 
which features scenes from the 2009 Iranian election protests on the video 
screen.[69][70] "Pride (In the Name of Love)", "MLK", "Walk On", "Where 
the Streets Have No Name", and "One" typically rounded out the main set, 
though the band occasionally closed it with "Bad" or "Mysterious Ways". 
"One" was usually preceded by a video from Archbishop Desmond Tutu talking 
about aid to Africa and the ONE campaign, though the video was played prior 
to "Where the Streets Have No Name" on occasion.[71] The second leg of 
the tour featured more variation in the first part of the setlist. "Breathe" 
opened most concerts, though its place was occasionally taken by "Magnificent". 
"No Line on the Horizon" continued to follow "Breathe" in early setlists, 
but was later moved back so that it followed "Beautiful Day" instead. "Mysterious 
Ways" and "Elevation" were performed more frequently, as was "I Still Haven't 
Found What I'm Looking For". "Your Blue Room", a track from Original Soundtracks 
1, made its live debut on the tour (with recorded guest vocals by Sinéad 
O'Connor),[21] while "Pride (In the Name of Love)" was dropped. "Unknown 
Caller" was dropped for a period of several weeks before being revived 
towards the end of the leg, and "In a Little While" also returned to the 
setlist. The third leg of the tour featured the debut of six previously 
unreleased songs: "North Star",[72] "Glastonbury",[72] the instrumental 
"Return of the Stingray Guitar",[72] "Every Breaking Wave",[73] "Mercy"[74] 
and "Boy Falls from the Sky", a song written by Bono and The Edge for the 
musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark. "Every Breaking Wave" was later 
released on U2's following studio album, Songs of Innocence (2014), and 
"Return of the Stingray Guitar" evolved into the backing track for the 
song "Lucifer's Hands", which was released on deluxe editions of the same 
album.[75] "Breathe", "Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of", and "Unknown 
Caller" were dropped from rotation, while "Miss Sarajevo", "I Will Follow", 
"Mothers of the Disappeared", "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me" and 
"Spanish Eyes" made their tour debuts. On the fourth leg of the tour, "Scarlet" 
was performed in place of "MLK" and dedicated to the release of Suu Kyi.[76] 
"One Tree Hill" made its tour debut and was dedicated to the 29 miners 
who died in the Pike River Mine disaster; their names were shown on the 
screen at the conclusion of the song.[76][77] "All I Want Is You" and "Love 
Rescue Me" were also included in the set during the fourth leg. During 
the sixth leg of the tour in South America, the "Fish Out of Water" remix 
of "Even Better Than The Real Thing", later released in the 20th anniversary 
reissue of Achtung Baby, was revived as the show opener. "Out Of Control" 
and "Zooropa" were also debuted, while "In a Little While" was dropped 
from the setlist. The seventh leg saw the tour debut of "The Fly". It moved 
"Mysterious Ways" and "Until the End of the World" both up in the setlist 
to be the third and fourth songs following "The Fly". The last show in 
Moncton, New Brunswick had the chorus of "The Ballad of Springhill" included 
in the setlist, as a tribute to the nearby town of Springhill, Nova Scotia, 
which suffered from a large mining disaster in 1958.[78] The encore was 
identical each night and consisted of "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)", "With 
or Without You", and "Moment of Surrender".[79] "Ultraviolet" featured 
an elaborate staging wherein Bono wore a suit with embedded with lasers 
that shone through the violet lighting scheme, while singing to, around, 
and hanging from, an illuminated steering wheel-shaped microphone dropped 
from above.[68] Following the band's exit from the stage, Elton John's 
"Rocket Man" was played. Beginning on the second leg of the tour "One" 
opened the first encore and was followed by "Where the Streets Have No 
Name", with "Amazing Grace" often used to bridge between them.[71] The 
second encore remained unchanged until the third leg, when "Hold Me, Thrill 
Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me" was debuted; U2 rotated it with "Ultraviolet (Light 
My Way)" to open the encore. At the 2 July 2011 show in Nashville, Bono 
invited a visually impaired fan on-stage to play "All I Want Is You" on 
guitar for his wife after the normal set closer "Moment of Surrender."[80] 
After the song, Bono gave the fan his Gretsch Irish Falcon guitar.[80] 
At the next show on 5 July 2011 in Chicago, the band performed "One Tree 
Hill" to end the show in honour of New Zealander Greg Carroll, an employee 
of the band whose 25th death anniversary was two days prior. The band's 
first single, "Out of Control", "Bad" and "40"[81] each closed a single 
show, each of them played after usual closer "Moment of Surrender". "The 
Unforgettable Fire" and "Love Rescue Me" were played in a U2 concert for 
the first time since the Lovetown Tour in 1990. "Ultraviolet (Light My 
Way)" and "Zooropa" had not been performed by the band since the Zoo TV 
Tour in 1993, while "Electrical Storm", a 2002 single from The Best of 
1990–2000, was played for the first time ever.[82][83] "Hold Me, Thrill 
Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me" was played for the first time since the end of the 
PopMart Tour in 1998.[84] "Scarlet", from the group's 1981 album October, 
was played for the first time ever in a concert setting, and for the first 
time since 1981.[76] Before the U2 360° Tour commenced, "If God Will Send 
His Angels", "Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own", and "Drowning Man", 
a previously unplayed song from War, were rehearsed, as was "Even Better 
Than the Real Thing" in the Perfecto mix style,[85] while The Edge stated 
in an interview with Rolling Stone that "Luminous Times (Hold on to Love)" 
was also being considered.[86] None of these were played during the first 
four legs of the tour. Willie Williams stated in his 27 June 2009 tour 
diary entry on U2.com that the band "really wants [Drowning Man] to work 
and it sounds great", but the rest of the setlist struggled due to the 
song's "beautiful melancholy".[87] In his 24 July 2009 entry, Williams 
noted that "October" and "White as Snow" were also being considered.[88] 
"Sunday Bloody Sunday" and "Mysterious Ways" were rehearsed in an acoustic 
style,[85] but performances during the tour were done by the full band. 
Before the third leg, "Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around the World" was 
also rehearsed. Bono stated that the setlist was divided into two acts 
and a coda. The first half, from "Breathe" to "Vertigo", focused on the 
personal, where Bono "envisages himself as a young man, struggling to find 
his feet in life and in search of some kind of personal epiphany."[69] 
The remix version of "I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight" was created 
by the music team Fish out of Water as a mashup of previous remixes by 
Redanka and Dirty South.[89] The "I'll Go Crazy" remix is intended to disorient 
the audience as the band moves into the second act, "Sunday Bloody Sunday" 
to the encore, which focuses more on the political aspect of Bono's persona, 
where he "[wrestles] with the problems of the wider world."[69] The coda, 
showcased in the encore, displays U2 "at their most raw and vulnerable, 
stripped to the metaphorical bone."[69] During some concerts on the European 
leg of the tour, a video link-up with the crew of the International Space 
Station was aired.[90] This segment was recorded by the astronauts on 26 
June 2009.[91] In an interview with BBC Radio, Bono stated that a second 
video piece had been recorded where the astronauts aboard the International 
Space Station sang "Your Blue Room".[70] A NASA press release revealed 
that crewmember Frank De Winne had recorded the final verse of the song 
on 18 August 2009.[91][92] Images of the Station and of space provided 
to the band by NASA were presented in a video montage during the piece, 
recorded for the North American leg of the tour.[91] A different video 
piece featuring DeWinne debuted at the Las Vegas concert during "In a Little 
While" where Frank repeats the bridge at the very end of the song. During 
the second North American leg, a recording of astronaut Mark Kelly during 
Space Shuttle Endeavour's trip to the International Space Station was used 
to introduce the song "Beautiful Day."[93] Using lyrics from David Bowie's 
"Space Oddity", he dedicated it to his wife, US Congress member Gabrielle 
Giffords. The representative, injured in the 2011 Tucson shooting and still 
in recovery at the time of the recording, had previously selected "Beautiful 
Day" as a wake-up call for Kelly during a previous shuttle mission.[94] 
The 25 October 2009 concert from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, 
U2's penultimate show of the year, was simultaneously broadcast live on 
YouTube and filmed for a future video release.[95] Directed by Tom Krueger, 
the shoot used 27 high definition cameras,[96] and it marked the first 
time since 1983's U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky that the 
band intentionally filmed over a single night—in contrast to recording 
multiple shows.[97] It was the first time a concert was streamed live on 
YouTube, and nearly 10 million people from 188 countries were reported 
to have watched.[98] The feed was initially set to be restricted to 16 
countries but was later made available worldwide.[99][100] In June 2010, 
the show was released to home video as U2360° at the Rose Bowl on DVD and 
Blu-ray,[96] receiving positive reviews from critics.[101] On 24 October 
2011, it was announced that U2 would release a double CD set entitled U22, 
containing 22 songs recorded during the tour. Members of U2.com were able 
to vote on what songs would appear on the release through December 2011. 
U22 is available only to members of U2.com. A bonus track, "Unknown Caller", 
was also made available to subscribers.[102] On 30 September 2012, U2.com 
announced its 2012/2013 subscriber's pack would contain a "lavish 260 page 
large-format hardback photobook" called From the Ground Up featuring photographs 
from the tour, 4 lithographs of each band member, bookmarks and an album 
called Edge's Pick that will contain 15 tracks from the tour selected by 
The Edge that were not on U22. Five bonus tracks, "No Line on the Horizon", 
"Spanish Eyes", "Desire", "Pride", and "Angel of Harlem", were also made 
available to subscribers.[103][104] Reception towards the U2 360° Tour 
was generally positive. The New York Times described the stage as "part 
insect, part spacecraft, part cathedral", noting that the design meant 
the band was more visible than on previous tours.[105] They also praised 
the fact that political messages took a backseat to the music, while NBC 
News suggested that using the video screen to display Aung San Suu Kyi 
and Desmond Tutu reminded attendees of the plights of people in the developing 
world.[105][106] Rolling Stone called the production a cross between Zoo 
TV and the Elevation Tour and noted that the design elements "all but disappear" 
from the band's perspective onstage.[21] Canada's National Post saw structural 
similarities in the stage to the alien craft in War of the Worlds, stating 
the concert "was as if the band had descended to colonize the stadium with 
their message of intergalactic hope", and that the space theme meant "When 
you can play music with someone who's in space, the idea goes, you're shrinking 
our corner of the universe down to size."[92] The Washington Post stated 
that the visual display made the band seem invincible, but that the performance 
was more of an "orgy of light and sound" than a rock concert.[107] In contrast, 
The Boston Globe complained that the stage's size caused the band to struggle 
to connect with the audience and play with intimacy, as all four members 
were often playing to a different section of the stadium.[108] The U2 360° 
Tour was the highest-grossing tour of 2009, with earnings of over $311 million 
for the year's 44 shows,[109] and around 3 million ticket sales.[48] Due 
to the high costs to operate the tour, U2's profits were minimal. Sales 
of No Line on the Horizon had been slow, meaning the group was not making 
much money from that either.[48] Through November 2010, the tour's first 
66 shows had grossed $443 million and sold 4.3 million tickets.[109][110] 
At the 2010 Billboard Touring Awards, U2 were honored for the year's Top 
Tour and Top Draw for U2 360°.[111] On 11 April 2011, Live Nation announced 
that the U2 360° Tour became the highest-grossing concert tour in history, 
with ticket sales totalling over $700 million.[112] The tour concluded 
in July 2011 with a final gross of $736,421,586, and a total attendance 
of 7,272,046.[113] According to Billboard.com, the final gross and attendance 
figures for the tour were the highest ever reported to the site.[114] At 
the 2011 Billboard Touring Awards, U2 repeated as winners in the Top Tour
