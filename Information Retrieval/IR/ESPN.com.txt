The website was part of the MSN portal from 2001 to 2004.[3][4] ESPN launched 
a Spanish language website in 2000, ESPN Deportes.com.[5] The content of 
some ESPN.com articles is argued to have been plagiarized.[6] ESPN started 
local chapters of its website in response to the decline of local sports 
coverage available as newspapers continue to go out of business across 
the country.[8] Each page covers local professional and college teams, 
hiring locally known writers, and in some cases making use of the city's 
ESPN Radio affiliate. In markets where the ABC Owned Television Stations 
owns a station, their sports coverage is incorporated with the corresponding 
ESPN local site. Some local sites have expanded into high school sports
