Reading (/ˈrɛdɪŋ/ RED-ing) (Pennsylvania German: Reddin), is the county 
seat of Berks County and with a population of 87,879[5] is the fifth-largest 
city in Pennsylvania.[6][7] Located in southeastern Pennsylvania, it is 
the principal city of the Greater Reading Area. The city, approximately 
halfway between Philadelphia and the state capital at Harrisburg, is strategically 
situated along a major transportation route from Central to Eastern Pennsylvania, 
and lent its name to the now-defunct Reading Railroad, which transported 
anthracite coal from the Pennsylvania Coal Region to the eastern United 
States via the Port of Philadelphia. Reading Railroad is one of the four 
railroad properties in the classic United States version of the Monopoly 
board game. Reading was one of the first localities where outlet shopping 
became a tourist industry. It has been known as "The Pretzel City", because 
of numerous local pretzel bakeries. Currently, Bachman, Dieffenbach, Tom 
Sturgis, and Unique Pretzel bakeries call the Reading area home. According 
to the 2010 census, Reading has the highest share of citizens living in 
poverty in the nation.[8] In recent years, the Reading area has become 
a destination for cyclists. With more than 125 miles of trails in five 
major preserves, it is an International Mountain Bicycling Association 
Ride Center and it annually hosts the Reading 120 international road cycling 
race.[9][10] Lenni Lenape people, also known as "Delaware Indians", were 
the original inhabitants of the Reading area. The Colony of Pennsylvania 
was a 1680 land grant from King Charles II of England to William Penn. 
Comprising more than 45,000 square miles (120,000 km2), it was named for 
his father, Sir William Penn. In 1743, Richard and Thomas Penn (sons of 
William Penn) mapped out the town of Reading with Conrad Weiser. Taking 
its name from Reading, Berkshire, England, the town was established in 
1748. Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became the county 
seat. The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western Germany, 
who bought land from the Penns. The first Amish community in the New World 
was established in Greater Reading, Berks County.[11] The Pennsylvanian 
German dialect was spoken in the area well into the 1950s and later. During 
the French and Indian War, Reading was a military base for a chain of forts 
along the Blue Mountain. By the time of the American Revolution, the area's 
iron industry had a total production which exceeded England's. That output 
that would help supply George Washington's troops with cannons, rifles, 
and ammunition in the Revolutionary War. During the early period of the 
conflict, Reading was again a depot for military supply. Hessian prisoners 
from the Battle of Trenton were also detained here. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 
was the capital of the United States at the time of the Yellow Fever Epidemic 
of 1793.[12] President Washington traveled to Reading, and considered making 
it the emergency national capital, but chose Germantown instead. Susanna 
Cox was tried and convicted for infanticide in Reading in 1809. Her case 
attracted tremendous sympathy; 20,000 viewers came to view her hanging, 
swamping the 3,000 inhabitants. Census data showed that, from 1810 to 1950, 
Reading was among the nation's top one hundred largest urban places. The 
Schuylkill Canal, a north-south canal completed in 1825, paralleled the 
Schuylkill River and connected Reading with Philadelphia and the Delaware 
River. The Union Canal, an east-west canal completed in 1828, connected 
the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Rivers, and ran from Reading to Middletown, 
Pennsylvania, a few miles south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Railroads 
forced the abandonment of the canals by the 1880s. The Philadelphia and 
Reading Railroad (P&R) was incorporated in 1833. During the Long Depression 
following the Panic of 1873, a statewide railroad strike in 1877 over delayed 
wages led to a violent protest and clash with the National Guard in which 
six Reading men were killed.[13] Following more than a century of prosperity, 
the Reading Company was forced to file for bankruptcy protection in 1971. 
The bankruptcy was a result of dwindling coal shipping revenues and strict 
government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set competitive 
prices, required high taxes, and forced the railroads to continue to operate 
money-losing passenger service lines. On April 1, 1976, the Reading Company 
sold its current railroad interests to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad 
Corporation (Conrail). Early in the 20th century, the city participated 
in the burgeoning automobile and motorcycle industry as home to the pioneer 
"Brass Era" companies, Daniels Motor Company, Duryea Motor Wagon Company 
and Reading-Standard Company.[14] Reading experienced continuous growth 
until the 1930s, when its population reached nearly 120,000. From the 1940s 
to the 1970s, however, the city saw a sharp downturn in prosperity, largely 
owing to the decline of the heavy industry and railroads, on which Reading 
had been built, and a national trend of urban decline. In 1972, Hurricane 
Agnes caused extensive flooding in the city, not the last time the lower 
precincts of Reading were inundated by the Schuylkill River. A similar, 
though not as devastating, flood occurred during June 2006. The 2000 census 
showed that Reading's population decline had ceased. This was attributed 
to an influx of Hispanic residents from New York City, as well as from 
the extension of suburban sprawl from Philadelphia's northwest suburbs. 
Reading has its share of obstacles to overcome, namely crime.[15] However, 
new crime fighting strategies appear to have had an impact. In 2006, the 
city dropped in the rankings of dangerous cities, and again in 2007. In 
December 2007, NBC's Today show featured Reading as one of the top four 
"Up and Coming Neighborhoods" in the United States as showing potential 
for a real estate boom.[16] The interviewee, Barbara Corcoran, chose the 
city by looking for areas of big change, renovations, cleanups of parks, 
waterfronts, and warehouses. Corcoran also noted Reading's proximity to 
Philadelphia, New York, and other cities. The climate in and around Reading 
is variable, but relatively mild. The Reading area is considered a humid 
subtropical climate, with areas just to the north designated as a humid 
continental climate. Summers are warm and humid with average July highs 
around 85 °F. Extended periods of heat and high humidity occur. On average, 
there are 15–20 days per year where the temperature exceeds 90 °F. Reading 
becomes milder in the autumn, as the heat and humidity of summer relent 
to lower humidity and temperatures. The first killing frost generally occurs 
in mid to late October. Winters bring freezing temperatures, but usually 
move above freezing during the day's warmest point. The average January 
high is 38; the average January low is 22 °F, but it is not unusual for 
winter temperatures to be much lower or higher than the averages. The all-time 
record low (not including wind chill) was −21 °F during a widespread cold 
wave in January 1994. Snow is common in some winters, but the harsher winter 
conditions experienced to the north and west are not typical of Greater 
Reading. Annual snowfall is variable, but averages around 32 inches. Spring 
temperatures vary widely between freezing temperatures and the 80s or even 
90s later in Spring. The last killing frost usually is in later April, 
but freezing temperatures have occurred in May. Total precipitation for 
the entire year is around 45 inches (112 cm). Reading is located at 40°20′30″N 
75°55′35″W﻿ / ﻿40.34167°N 75.92639°W﻿ / 40.34167; -75.92639 (40.341692, 
−75.926301)[18] in southeastern Pennsylvania, roughly 65 miles (105 km) 
northwest of Philadelphia. According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the city has a total area of 10.1 square miles (26 km2). 9.8 square miles 
(25 km2) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2) of it (2.39%) is 
water. The total area is 2.39% water. The city is largely bounded on the 
west by the Schuylkill River, on the east by Mount Penn, and on the south 
by Neversink Mountain. The Reading Prong, the mountain formation stretching 
north into New Jersey, has come to be associated with naturally-occurring 
radon gas; however, homes in Reading are not particularly affected. The 
surrounding county is home to a number of family-owned farms.[citation 
needed] Companies based in Reading and surrounding communities include 
Boscov's, Carpenter, GK Elite Sportswear, Penske Truck Leasing, and Redner's 
Markets. In 2012, The New York Times called Reading "the nation's poorest 
city."[19] According to the Greater Reading Chamber of Commerce and Industry,[20] 
the largest employers in the Berks county area are Jump Start Incubator, 
a program of Berks County Community Foundation and the Kutztown University 
Small Business Development Center, is intended to help entrepreneurs open 
new businesses in the area.[21] Public transit in Reading and its surrounding 
communities has been provided since 1973 by BARTA, the Berks Area Regional 
Transportation Authority. BARTA operates a fleet of 57 buses serving 21 
routes, mostly originating at the BARTA Transportation Center in Downtown 
Reading. BARTA also provides paratransit service in addition to fixed route 
service. In addition, Greyhound and Bieber Trailways bus routes are available 
from the InterCity Bus Terminal. The former Reading Railroad Franklin Street 
Station was refurbished and reopened to bus service on September 9, 2013 
with buses running the express route back and forth to Lebanon Transit. 
This Lebanon Route was discontinued after a short period. Now the refurbished 
Station sits vacant. A number of federal and state highways allow entry 
to and egress from Reading. U.S. Route 222 Business is designated as Lancaster 
Avenue, Bingaman Street, South 4th Street, and 5th Street. U.S. Route 422 
Business is designated as Penn Street, Washington Street (westbound), Franklin 
Street (eastbound), and Perkiomen Avenue. U.S. Route 422, the major east-west 
artery, circles the western edge of the city and is known locally as The 
West Shore Bypass. PA Route 12 is known as the Warren Street Bypass, as 
it bypasses the city to the north. PA Route 10 is known as Morgantown Road. 
From the 1960s to the late 1990s, the section of current U.S. Route 222 
from Spring Blvd to 5th Street Highway was known locally as the 'Road to 
Nowhere'. Reading and the surrounding area is serviced by the Reading Regional 
Airport, a general aviation airfield. The three-letter airport code for 
Reading is RDG. Scheduled commercial airline service to Reading ended in 
2004, when the last airline, USAir stopped flying into Reading. Passenger 
trains ran between Pottsville, Reading, Pottstown and Philadelphia until 
July 27, 1981, when transit operator SEPTA curtailed commuter service to 
electrified lines. Since then, there have been repeated calls for the resumption 
of the services. In the late 1990s and up to 2003, SEPTA, in cooperation 
with Reading-based BARTA funded a study called the Schuylkill Valley Metro 
which included plans to extend both sides of SEPTA's R6 passenger line 
to Pottstown, Reading, and Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. The project suffered 
a major setback when it was rejected by the Federal Transit Administration 
New Starts program, which cited doubts about the ridership projections 
and financing assumptions used by the study. With the recent surge in gasoline 
prices and ever-increasing traffic, the planning commissions of Montgomery 
County and Berks County have teamed to study the feasibility of a simple 
diesel shuttle train between the Norristown/Manayunk Line and Pottstown/Reading.[22]

schools for the city's children. Numerous Catholic parochial schools are 
also available. Press reports have indicated that in 2012, about eight 
percent of Reading's residents have a college degree, compared to a national 
average of 28%.[19] Four institutions of higher learning are located in 
Reading: Four high schools serve the city: Reading is known for the Reading 
Fightin Phils, minor league affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies, who 
play at FirstEnergy Stadium. Notable alumni are Larry Bowa, Ryne Sandberg, 
Mike Schmidt, Ryan Howard, and Jimmy Rollins. The city has been the residence 
of numerous professional athletes. Among these native to Reading are Brooklyn 
Dodgers outfielder Carl Furillo, Baltimore Colts running back Lenny Moore, 
and Philadelphia 76ers forward Donyell Marshall. Pro golfer Betsy King, 
a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame, was born in Reading. The open-wheel 
racing portion of Penske Racing had been based in Reading, Pennsylvania 
since 1973 with the cars, during the F1 and CART era, being constructed 
in Poole, Dorset, England as well as being the base for the F1 team. On 
October 31, 2005, Penske Racing announced after the 2006 IRL season, they 
would consolidate IRL and NASCAR operations at the team's Mooresville, 
North Carolina facility; with the flooding in Pennsylvania in 2006, the 
team's operations were moved to Mooresville earlier than expected. Penske 
Truck Leasing is still based in Reading. Duryea Drive, which ascends Mount 
Penn in a series of switchbacks, was a testing place for early automobiles 
and was named for Charles Duryea. The Blue Mountain Region Sports Car Club 
of America hosts the Duryea Hill Climb, the longest in the Pennsylvania 
Hillclimb Association series, which follows the same route the automaker 
used to test his cars.[31] Reading played host to a stop on the PGA Tour, 
the Reading Open, in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The city's cultural 
institutions include the Reading Symphony Orchestra and its education project 
the Reading Symphony Youth Orchestra, the Reading Choral Society, Opus 
One: Berks Chamber Choir, the GoggleWorks Art Gallery, the Reading Public 
Museum and the Historical Society of Berks County. Reading is the birthplace 
of graphic artist Jim Steranko, guitar virtuoso Richie Kotzen, George Baer 
Hiester, singer Taylor Swift, and most notably, novelist and poet John 
Updike and the world-renowned poet Wallace Stevens. Marching band composer 
and writer John Philip Sousa, the March King, died in Reading's Abraham 
Lincoln Hotel in 1932. Keith Haring,[32] NFL quarterbacks Chad Henne, Kerry 
Collins, wide receiver Steve Kreider, are not from the City of Reading, 
but surrounding towns in Berks County. Reading is home to the 14-time world-champion 
drum and bugle corps, the Reading Buccaneers. In 1914, one the anchors 
of the Battleship Maine was delivered from the Washington Navy Yard to 
City Park, off of Perkiomen Avenue. The anchor was dedicated during a ceremony 
presided over by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was then assistant secretary 
of the navy. Reading was home to several movie and theater palaces in the 
early 20th Century. The Astor, Embassy, Loew's Colonial, and Rajah Shrine 
Theater were grand monuments of architecture and entertainment. Today, 
after depression, recession, and urban renewal, the Rajah is the only one 
to remain. The Astor Theater was demolished in 1998 to make way for The 
Sovereign Center. Certain steps were taken to retain mementos of the Astor, 
including its ornate Art Deco chandelier and gates. These are on display 
and in use inside the arena corridors, allowing insight into the ambiance 
of the former movie house. In 2000, the Rajah was purchased from the Shriners. 
After a much needed restoration, it was renamed the Sovereign Performing 
Arts Center. The Mid-Atlantic Air Museum is a membership-supported museum 
and restoration facility located at Carl A. Spaatz Field. The museum actively 
displays and restores historic and rare war aircraft and civilian airliners. 
Most notable to their collection is a Northrop P-61 Black Widow under active 
restoration since its recovery from Mount Cyclops, New Guinea in 1989. 
Beginning in 1990, the museum has hosted "World War II Weekend Air Show", 
scheduled to coincide with D-Day. On display are period wartime aircraft 
(many of which fly throughout the show) vehicles, and weapons. The mechanical 
ice cream scoop was invented in Reading by William Clewell in 1878. The 
5th Ave Bar and York Peppermint Patty were invented in Reading.[11] The 
City of Reading and Reutlingen, Germany are sister cities which participate 
in student exchanges. Students from Reading High School can apply to become 
a part of the exchange and travel to Reutlingen for 2 weeks (Mid October 
to Early September) and in return host their German exchange student in 
the spring. Kutztown University also has a program with Reutlingen. Reading 
is twinned with: In 1908, a Japanese-style pagoda was built on Mount Penn, 
where it overlooks the city and is visible from almost everywhere in town. 
Locally, it is referred to as the "The Pagoda". It is currently the home 
of a café and a gift shop. It remains a popular tourist attraction. Another 
fixture in Reading's skyline is the William Penn Memorial Fire Tower, one 
mile from the Pagoda on Skyline Drive. Built in 1939 for fire department 
and forestry observation, the tower is 120 feet tall, and rises 950 feet 
above the intersection of fifth and Penn Streets. From the top of the tower 
is a 60-mile panoramic view. The Reading Glove and Mitten Manufacturing 
Company founded in 1899, just outside Reading city limits, in West Reading 
and Wyomissing boroughs changed its name to Vanity Fair in 1911 and is 
now the major clothing manufacturer VF Corp. In the early 1970s, the original 
factories were developed to create the VF Outlet Village, the first outlet 
mall in the United States. The book and movie Rabbit, Run and the other 
three novels of the Rabbit series by John Updike were set in fictionalized 
versions of Reading and nearby Shillington, called Brewer and Olinger respectively. 
Updike was born in Reading and lived in nearby Shillington until he was 
thirteen. He also makes reference to the Brewer suburb of Mount Judge, 
equivalent to Mount Penn east of Reading. Filmmakers Gary Adelstein, Costa 
Mantis, and Jerry Orr created Reading 1974: Portrait of a City; relying 
heavily on montage, the film is a cultural time capsule. The play Sweat
