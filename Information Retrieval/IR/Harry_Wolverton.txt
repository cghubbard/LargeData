As Player As Manager Harry Sterling Wolverton (December 6, 1873 – February 
4, 1937), nicknamed "Fighting Harry",[1] was an American professional baseball 
player. He played all or part of nine seasons in Major League Baseball 
from 1898 through 1905 and 1912. He played for the Chicago Orphans, Philadelphia 
Phillies, Washington Senators, Boston Beaneaters, and New York Highlanders, 
primarily as a third baseman.[2] He also managed the Highlanders in 1912. 
In addition to playing in MLB, Wolverton managed several minor league baseball 
teams. After he retired from baseball, he worked as a police officer with 
the Oakland Police Department. Wolverton was born in Mount Vernon, Ohio, 
on December 6, 1873, to Amanda and John the Baptist Wolverton. John, a 
veteran of the Civil War, worked with Amanda's father in dyeing. Harry 
had an older brother, Fred, and a younger sister, Birdie. Fred became a 
dentist, while Birdie married and moved to Florida.[3] Wolverton played 
sandlot ball, and then played for his high school baseball team. Wolverton 
then enrolled at Kenyon College, where he played American football as a 
halfback, and baseball as a catcher. However, he left Kenyon after his 
junior year, as he was facing possible expulsion. Wolverton played semi-professional 
baseball for a Paulding, Ohio team for the summer of 1895, earning $60 
a month ($1,710 in current dollar terms) as a pitcher and first baseman.[3] 
Wolverton signed with the Columbus Senators of the Western League on February 
22, 1896, beginning his professional career in minor league baseball as 
a pitcher. During the 1896 season, he struggled with his control, relegating 
him to the role of a relief pitcher. He did register a .385 batting average 
in limited at-bats.[3] The next season, Wolverton was demoted to the Dubuque, 
Iowa franchise of the Western Association. Pitching for Dubuque, Wolverton 
hurt his pitching arm. Dubuque began to play Wolverton as a third baseman. 
His .294 batting average led the team, and he was named team captain. Columbus 
soon recalled Wolverton, and he responded by posting a .400 batting average 
through July 1898.[3] In August 1898, the Chicago Orphans of the National 
League (NL), a major league, purchased Wolverton from Columbus. He made 
his debut with the Orphans on September 25. Manager Tom Burns named Wolverton 
his starting third baseman in 1899, and batted him third in the lineup. 
The Orphans sold Wolverton to the Philadelphia Phillies on April 28, 1900.[3] 
Wolverton tied a major league record in 1900 by hitting three triples in 
one game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. That season, he batted .282 for 
the Phillies, recording a career-high 58 runs batted in in 101 games. Late 
in the 1900 season, he was struck in the head by a pole beside the Philadelphia 
streetcar tracks, fracturing his skull. He returned to finish the season 
for the Phillies. Wolverton batted .309 in 93 games in 1901, but broke 
his collarbone in a collision with Fred Tenney of the Boston Beaneaters.[3] 
He led the NL in fielding percentage among third baseman (.921).[4] After 
a dispute with Phillies management about his contract after the 1901 season, 
Wolverton signed a contract with the Washington Senators of the rival American 
League. Courts in Washington and Philadelphia ruled that the move was legal, 
but that Wolverton could not play in the state of Pennsylvania unless he 
played for the Phillies. Wolverton hit .249 and committed 24 errors in 
59 games with Washington. Wolverton expressed his desire to return to Philadelphia, 
and the Senators acknowledged that signing Wolverton was a mistake. Wolverton 
finished the season with the Phillies, where he hit .294 in 34 games. In 
the 1903 season, he batted .308 with 12 triples, a career high, in 123 
games.[3] He again led all NL third basemen in fielding percentage (.941).[5] 
Wolverton batted .266 in 102 games during the 1904 season, once again leading 
NL third basemen in fielding percentage (.925).[6] After the season, the 
Phillies traded Wolverton to the Beaneaters with Chick Fraser for Togie 
Pittinger. He played for one season with Boston, batting .225.[2][3] Though 
his .934 fielding percentage was second best among NL third basemen, trailing 
only Doc Casey,[7] the Beaneaters released Wolverton after the season.[3] 
Wolverton returned to minor league baseball, joining the Williamsport Millionaires 
of the Tri-State League in 1906 as their third baseman. The next year, 
he became their player-manager. He continued with Williamsport through 
the 1908 season. He then became player-manager of the Newark Indians of 
the Eastern League in 1909. Joe McGinnity purchased Newark and announced 
that he would continue to pitch for the team. After Wolverton removed McGinnity 
from a game, the owner demoted Wolverton to team captain and assumed managerial 
duties for the remainder of the season.[3] Wolverton managed the Oakland 
Oaks of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 1910 and 1911. A team with little 
fan support, Wolverton led the Oaks into contention in the PCL, which brought 
fans to the stadium. Wolverton attempted to purchase the Oaks, but was 
rebuffed.[3] He was also offered the managerial job in Newark, but he declined, 
opting to remain in Oakland.[8] In 1912, Wolverton was named manager of 
the New York Highlanders of the AL, replacing Hal Chase. He led the Highlanders 
to a last-place finish and a 50–102 record (.329 winning percentage).[2] 
He inserted himself into games as a pinch hitter, batting .300 in limited 
playing time. Despite his efforts to reverse the team's fortunes, he was 
let go by Frank J. Farrell after the 1912 season.[9] Wolverton returned 
to the PCL, managing the Sacramento Sacts in 1913 and 1914. He purchased 
the team with a business partner after the 1913 season for $20,000 ($479,663 
in current dollar terms), but the team lost $24,000 the next year ($567,947 
in current dollar terms) and went bankrupt. He managed the San Francisco 
Seals of the PCL from 1915 through June 17, 1917, when he was fired. He 
led the Seals to the PCL championship in 1915, and had the Seals in first 
place at the time of his firing, which team owner Henry Berry said was 
over player salaries. Wolverton announced his retirement from baseball.[3] 
Wolverton returned to professional baseball as the manager of the Seattle 
Indians of the PCL in 1923. He argued with the team's owners about the 
amount of money spent to acquire new players, and resigned on July 8, 1923.[3] 
Wolverton married Mary Maroney in 1903. They had five daughters. One of 
his daughters, Mary, died of an illness at the age of 10 on April 28, 1920.[3] 
Wolverton purchased a farm in San Mateo, California in July 1917, after 
he was fired from the Seals. In 1931, he became a police officer with the 
Oakland Police Department.[3] Wolverton died in Oakland, California, at 
age 63 in a hit-and-run automobile accident. He was on patrol that day, 
and it was the second hit-and-run accident he suffered during the shift.[3]
