Matthew Ryan "Matt" Kemp (born September 23, 1984) is an American professional 
baseball outfielder for the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He began his professional career in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization 
in 2003, and played with the Dodgers from 2006 until 2014. He played for 
the San Diego Padres in 2015 and 2016. He has been named to two All-Star 
teams and has won two Gold Glove Awards (2009 and 2011) and two Silver 
Slugger Awards (2009 and 2011). The Dodgers selected Kemp in the sixth 
round of the 2003 MLB draft. After four seasons in the minor leagues, he 
made his major league debut in 2006. He did not become a full-time player 
until 2008, when he took over as the starting center fielder for the Dodgers. 
In 2011, Kemp led the National League in runs scored (115), total bases 
(353), OPS+ (171), WAR (7.8), home runs (39), and runs batted in (126). 
Additionally, he became the first player to finish in the top two in both 
home runs and steals since Hank Aaron in 1963.[1] He was traded to the 
Padres after the 2014 season. Primarily a center fielder with the Dodgers, 
Kemp transitioned to right field with the Padres. Kemp is the son of Carl 
Kemp and Judy Henderson, who never married. He was raised in Oklahoma by 
his mother, a registered nurse, and grandmother.[2][3] When he was 13, 
his mother had another son, Tyler, who was born prematurely and died at 
age one.[3] Kemp attended Midwest City High School in Oklahoma, where he 
was a standout in basketball and baseball.[4] He was teammates with Shelden 
Williams on the varsity basketball team that won the state title two years 
in a row, and the team was ranked third in the nation at one point.[5] 
Kemp himself was an All-City selection, and averaged 20 points a game.[6] 
Kemp, along with Williams and three other teammates, were accused of raping 
a 19-year-old woman at the time of a high school all-star basketball tournament 
on January 20, 2002, at the Columbus, Ohio Hyatt hotel.[7] The players 
were suspended from the team during the investigation. However, the woman 
did not press charges, and the district attorney opted to not pursue the 
matter due to a lack of evidence.[8] Kemp was drafted by the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in the 6th round of the 2003 MLB draft, and signed with the team 
on June 5, 2003, for a $130,000 signing bonus.[9] Kemp started his professional 
career for the Gulf Coast Dodgers in 2003 and followed that up with stints 
with the Columbus Catfish in 2004 and the Vero Beach Dodgers in 2004–05.[10] 
At Columbus and Vero Beach, Kemp improved his power numbers. After hitting 
just a single home run in 43 games, Kemp became more of a power hitter. 
In 2004 with Columbus, he belted 18 home runs to go along with 27 doubles 
in 122 games, and in 2005, he belted 27 home runs to go along with 21 doubles 
in 109 games.[10] He was selected to the Florida State League All-Star 
team in 2005,[11] and set Vero Beach franchise records for home runs (27) 
and slugging percentage (.569).[12] Kemp began 2006 with the AA Jacksonville 
Suns, where he hit .327 with seven homers, 34 runs batted in (RBIs) and 
11 steals, prompting a promotion to the major league squad. His promotion 
was spurred by an effort to provide regular rest for center fielder Kenny 
Lofton and oft injured right field All-Star J. D. Drew.[13] Kemp made his 
major league debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 28, 2006, against 
the Washington Nationals.[1] He got his first career major league hit that 
same game, a single off of Jon Rauch.[14] He hit his first Major League 
homer on June 1 in his second Dodger Stadium at-bat off the Philadelphia 
Phillies' Gavin Floyd.[15] He homered in three straight games from June 
1–3 against the Phillies and homered twice on June 11 off Colorado Rockies 
starter Aaron Cook. He also became the first Dodger and fifth major league 
player to hit four homers in his first 10 days with the team.[4] After 
his fast start, Kemp slumped and hit only .234 with no homers from June 
14 through July 13, when he was reassigned to the AAA Las Vegas 51s.[16] 
He returned to the team when rosters expanded on September 1.[17] In his 
second stint in the Majors, Kemp struggled. He batted just .156 with a 
.182 on-base percentage and a .250 slugging percentage in September and 
October combined.[18] By season's end, Kemp showed some power, with seven 
home runs and speed, with six stolen bases but he struggled with his batting 
average and getting on base. He batted just .253 and posted an on-base 
percentage of .289.[1] Kemp started the 2007 season on the major league 
roster[19] but lost his place after suffering a shoulder injury while running 
into the outfield fence at Dodger Stadium.[20] Upon his return from the 
injury, he was optioned back to Las Vegas.[21] Returning to Triple-A and 
playing for the Las Vegas 51s, Kemp played well in his short stint. In 
just 39 games, he had a .329 batting average, .374 on-base percentage, 
and a .540 slugging percentage. He hit four home runs, drove in 20 runs, 
and stole nine bases out of 11 attempts.[10] He was recalled to the Dodgers 
on June 8.[22] He enjoyed an outstanding sophomore campaign with the bat 
batting .342, clubbing 10 home runs, and driving in 42 runs.[1] Kemp became 
the starting right fielder in 2008.[23] He hit his first career grand slam 
off of Mark Redman on April 26 against the Colorado Rockies. Kemp drove 
in the first run of the game for the Dodgers, a sacrifice fly in the first 
inning that scored Juan Pierre.[24] After driving in 11 runs and stealing 
6 bases. He was named "National League Player of the Week" for the week 
of April 28 – May 4.[25] After a knee injury to Andruw Jones, Kemp became 
the Dodgers' regular center fielder, moving over from right field.[26] 
His best month of the season was in July, in which he had a .324 batting 
average, .402 on-base percentage, .537 slugging percentage to go along 
with five home runs, 14 RBIs, and 10 stolen bases.[27] That month also 
sparked Kemp's career high 19-game hitting streak, which lasted from July 
9 through August 1, ending with a hit less performance on August 2. However, 
Kemp got back on track the next night by having a three-hit game to go 
along with a home run.[28] He finished the season with a .290 average, 
18 homers and 76 RBI. He was also second on the team in stolen bases with 
35.[29] In addition, he set a Dodgers record with 153 strikeouts in a season.[1] 
In his first career postseason game, Kemp went 1 for 4 with a double. However, 
he batted just .154 in the 2008 National League Division Series (NLDS) 
against the Chicago Cubs. Both of his hits went for doubles. In the 2008 
National League Championship Series (NLCS), against the Philadelphia Phillies, 
Kemp did better, batting .333 as the Dodgers lost the series to the eventual 
World Series champions.[1] Kemp had his first career walk-off hit on June 
16 against the Oakland A's.[30] On September 24, he became the first player 
in Dodger history to hit at least .295, with 25 home runs, 100 RBIs, and 
30 steals in one season.[31] He finished the year with .297, 26 home runs, 
101 RBI, and 34 steals (third in the NL). His 10 RBIs in extra innings 
were the most that a player has driven in extra innings since 1991 and 
he became the first player to reach double-digits in this category since 
1982.[4] Kemp hit his first career post-season home run on October 7 in 
his first at-bat of the 2009 NLDS against the St. Louis Cardinals.[32] 
After the season, Kemp was selected as a recipient of both the Gold Glove 
Award[33] and the Silver Slugger Award.[34] He also tied a Dodger record 
with three grand slams in one season.[35] Kemp began the 2010 season in 
excellent fashion, hitting seven home runs in the month of April, including 
four in four days from April 13–16.[36] On June 1, Kemp hit his first career 
walk-off home run against the Arizona Diamondbacks off of relief pitcher 
J. C. Gutiérrez, giving the Dodgers the only run of the game. Kemp described 
his first career walk-off home run as "a great feeling".[37] However, he 
slumped badly in the second half of the season and finished with a .249 
batting average, 28 home runs, 89 RBIs, and 19 steals while playing in 
all 162 games for the first time in his career. He also broke his own single-season 
Dodger record for strikeouts, with 170.[38] Kemp was the subject of some 
criticism in 2010 from General Manager Ned Colletti, who called him out 
publicly early in the season for poor baserunning.[39] Kemp had several 
embarrassing gaffes on the base paths during the season, and was caught 
stealing 15 times.[40] With runners in scoring position, he hit seven home 
runs and drove in 61 runs in 160 at bats. However, he struck out 49 times 
and batted just .225 in that spot. Against right-handed pitching, he batted 
just .233 with a .299 on-base percentage, to go along with 22 home runs 
and 69 RBIs, as opposed to a .295 average against left-handed pitchers.[41] 
Kemp hit home runs in five straight games to end the season, the first 
major league player to accomplish that feat and the first Dodger since 
Shawn Green in the 2001 season to hit homers in five consecutive games.[42] 
The only other Dodgers to homer in five consecutive games are Roy Campanella 
(1950), Adrian Gonzalez (2014–15), and Joc Pederson (2015).[43] After his 
much publicized problems on the base paths the previous season, Kemp arrived 
at spring training early to work with new Dodger coach Davey Lopes on his 
base running. Kemp announced his intention to steal 40 bases this season 
and Lopes hoped they would be high percentage steals.[44] At the end of 
the season, Kemp had the 40 steals and was only caught 11 times, a significant 
improvement in percentage from the previous year, and his work with Lopes 
was credited for much of the improvement.[45] On April 17, Kemp hit his 
second career walk-off home run, doing it in the ninth inning off of St. 
Louis Cardinals closer Ryan Franklin, on a 2–2 count that gave the Dodgers 
a 2–1 victory."[46] In a game against the Atlanta Braves five days later, 
Kemp hit his second walk-off home run of the season, this time in the 12th 
inning off of Braves pitcher Cristhian Martínez.[47] After being one of 
the league leaders in home runs, stolen bases, RBIs, and batting average 
during the first half of the season, Kemp was voted as a starter for the 
National League squad in the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 
Arizona. He also accepted an invitation to participate in the Home Run 
Derby at the All-Star Game.[48] The day before the All-Star Game, Giants' 
manager and 2011 NL All-Star Manager, Bruce Bochy, announced his decision 
to bat Kemp third in the line up. Explaining his decision, Bochy said about 
Kemp, "He's a guy with speed, power, a guy that can beat you with a base 
hit or a long ball. He's what you call a complete player – tremendous defender, 
but more so in the 3-hole, he can do so many things for you. He's so dangerous."[49] 
Kemp, with a single and a walk, became the first Dodger to reach base twice 
in an All-Star Game since Mike Piazza in 1996.[50] Kemp hit his 30th home 
run of the season on August 26, and in the process became the second Dodger 
player of all time to hit at least 30 homers and steal at least 30 bases 
in the same season (30–30 club). The only other one was Raúl Mondesí in 
the 1997 and 1999 seasons.[51] He picked up his 40th stolen base on September 
17, becoming the 18th Major Leaguer and first Dodger in history to hit 
at least 30 homers and steal at least 40 bases. Kemp also scored his 100th 
run of the season, making him just the 10th L.A. Dodger to score 100 runs 
and have 100 RBIs in a season, and the first since Jeff Kent in 2005.[52] 
He hit his 35th home run on September 21, making him the 14th Major Leaguer 
(and first since Alfonso Soriano in 2006) to hit at least 35 home runs 
and steal at least 35 bases in a season.[53] On September 20, the Dodgers 
announced Kemp was selected by his teammates as the recipient of the 2011 
Roy Campanella Award, which is given annually to the Dodger player who 
best exemplifies the spirit and leadership of the late Roy Campanella.[54] 
He also won the NL Player of the Week Award for the week of September 19–25, 
2011 after he hit .423 (11 for 26) with nine runs scored and three home 
runs during that week.[55] Kemp wound up hitting 39 home runs in 2011 with 
126 RBIs, leading the league in both categories, the first Dodger to do 
so since Dolph Camilli in the 1941 season.[56] He also led the league in 
runs scored (115), total bases (353), OPS+ (171), and WAR (10.0). He finished 
second in slugging percentage (.586), OPS (.986), extra base hits (76), 
and stolen bases (40, tied), and third in batting average (.324) and outfield 
assists (11).[57] Kemp also extended his games played streak to 364 games, 
as he played in every game of the season.[58] He was the first player to 
finish in the top two in both home runs and steals since Hank Aaron in 
the 1963 season.[59] After struggling to hit with runners in scoring position 
the previous year, Kemp bounced back and hit well with runners in scoring 
position. In 155 at-bats with runners in scoring position, he hit .335 
(52-for-155) with 13 home runs and 87 RBIs. And against right-handers, 
he batted .319 (150-for-470) with 28 home runs and 94 RBIs.[60] Kemp was 
selected for a number of post-season awards, including the Baseball America 
Major League Player of the Year,[61] the Hank Aaron Award for the top hitter 
in the National League (the first Dodger player to ever win the award)[62] 
the Gold Glove Award[63] and the Silver Slugger Award.[64] On October 27, 
he was named to the 2011 Sporting News National League All-Star team.[65] 
On November 22, Kemp came in second to Ryan Braun in the voting for the 
National League Most Valuable Player Award.[66] Later, it was revealed 
that Braun had tested positive for elevated testosterone and baseball attempted 
to suspend him, but lost on appeal.[67] A survey of baseball writers revealed 
that if the MVP vote was retaken, with knowledge of Braun's positive test, 
then Kemp would have won.[68] Braun was eventually suspended as part of 
the Biogenesis scandal.[69] Kemp publicly stated that he believed Braun 
should be stripped of his MVP Award from that season.[70] After the season, 
Kemp signed a franchise record 8-year, $160 million contract extension.[71] 
After signing his extension, he predicted that he would become the first 
player in history to have a 50–50 season.[72] Kemp started the 2012 season 
by winning the National League Player of the Week award for the opening 
weekend. He hit two home runs and drove in eight RBIs during the opening 
series against the San Diego Padres. He was also the first Dodger to record 
three consecutive multi-hit games to start the season since Adrián Beltré 
did it in the 2000 season. This was the third time he had won the award, 
and second consecutive as he had won it the final week of 2011 as well.[73] 
On April 10, Kemp became the first LA Dodger to have an RBI in the first 
five games of the season since J. D. Drew in the 2006 season and, counting 
the end of the previous season, he had nine straight games with an RBI, 
tying Roy Campanella (1955 season) and Augie Galan (1944 season) for the 
Dodgers franchise record.[74] Kemp also won the Player of the Week award 
for the second week of the season, which, combined with winning the award 
in the last week of 2011, made him the only player to ever win three consecutive 
awards. He was also only the second player to win the award twice to begin 
the season, the other being Tony Armas for the 1981 Athletics. Kemp hit 
12–22 with 4 HRs and a 1.182 slugging percentage, leading the club to its 
best 10-game start since 1981.[75] Kemp hit his 10th home run of the season 
on April 25, tying Gary Sheffield's club record for homers in April set 
in the 2000 season.[76] He broke Sheffield's record with a walk-off homer 
against the Washington Nationals on April 28.[77] Kemp was also named National 
League player of the month for April.[78] Kemp was placed on the disabled 
list on May 14 because of a hamstring injury, ending his streak of 399 
consecutive games played, which was the longest in the majors at the time.[79] 
After his DL stint, he promptly re-injured his hamstring two days later 
while running the bases, and returned to the DL.[80] Despite missing about 
2 months with injuries, Kemp was voted by the fans as a starter for the 
2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. As he was still on the disabled 
list, Kemp did not play in the game but he did participate in the Home 
Run Derby for the second straight year, hitting one home run in the Derby. 
Kemp finally returned to the Dodgers lineup on July 13, after missing about 
two months with his hamstring injury.[81] Kemp's injury woes continued 
as he crashed into the outfield wall at Coors Field in Colorado on August 
28, and injured both his knee and his shoulder.[82] He continued to play 
despite the injuries. He finished the season batting .303 with 23 home 
runs and 69 RBIs in 106 games. His 9 stolen bases were his fewest since 
his first season.[1] After the season, Kemp underwent surgery on his sore 
shoulder to repair a torn labrum and some minor damage to his rotator cuff. 
He was told that he wouldn't be able to swing a bat again until January.[83] 
Kemp recorded his 1,000th career hit on May 12, 2013, against the Miami 
Marlins.[84] However, Kemp struggled out of the gate in 2013, subsequent 
to his shoulder surgery in the offseason. On May 27, Kemp went 0-for-5 
with 4 strikeouts, and was booed heavily by the majority of the Dodgers 
crowd. Teammate Adrian Gonzalez said that Kemp was "trying too hard for 
the team and the fans."[85] On May 29, Kemp injured his right hamstring 
in a game. He left during the seventh inning, and did not return to the 
game.[86] Kemp was placed on the 15-day disabled list on May 30.[87] He 
spent time rehabbing at Camelback Ranch, the Dodgers spring training home, 
and was close to returning when he suffered a setback on June 9.[88] Kemp 
returned to the Dodgers on June 25, after missing 24 games. In that game, 
Kemp made a game-ending catch while reaching over his shoulder, robbing 
the Giants' Marco Scutaro of a hit.[89] He returned to the disabled list 
on July 8, after experiencing pain in his surgically repaired shoulder.[90] 
He returned from the DL again on July 21 against the Washington Nationals, 
and was 3 for 4 with a home run and a double in the game. However, he injured 
his ankle in a play at home plate in the ninth inning of the game. After 
initially expressing optimism that the injury was not serious, he again 
was placed on the 15-day DL on July 24.[91][92] Reacting to criticism of 
his string of injuries, Kemp said: "I'm not made of glass."[93] Kemp's 
ankle injury took a lot longer to heal than had been expected, and the 
team reported that they hoped to get him back in September.[94][95][96] 
However, when he finally began his minor league rehab assignment at Class-A 
Rancho Cucamonga in late August, he struggled at the plate and his return 
date was pushed back.[97] He went hitless in five games, with seven strikeouts, 
and when the minor league season ended on September 2 he was moved to Camelback 
Ranch to continue his rehab rather than being activated.[98] A few days 
later, he experienced tightness in the same hamstring he had hurt earlier 
in the year, and the Dodgers shut him down indefinitely.[99] He eventually 
rejoined the Dodgers lineup on September 17, and had four hits (including 
two doubles) in four at bats.[100] He played regularly in an attempt to 
get his timing back before the playoffs. However, he was a late scratch 
from a game on September 28 because of soreness in his ankle. An MRI the 
following day revealed major swelling in a weight-bearing bone in his ankle. 
Kemp was told that if he kept playing his ankle could break and leave him 
with chronic problems for the rest of his career. He was shut down, and 
the team announced he would not be available for the playoffs and would 
have surgery to repair the problem.[101] Kemp suffered an articular talar 
injury requiring microfracture surgery to his talus bone.[102] He appeared 
in only 73 games in 2013, due to his various injuries. He hit .270 with 
6 home runs and 33 RBIs, and a .395 slugging percentage.[1][103] With the 
Dodgers crowded outfield situation, Kemp was the subject of much trade 
speculation after the season.[104] His agent, Dave Stewart, publicly stated 
that he expected Kemp to be traded during the off-season.[105] However, 
Stewart later remarked that the team had assured him that it would not 
be making such a trade.[106] Recovering from various injuries, Kemp sat 
out most of spring training and only started playing in minor league rehab 
games after the Dodgers left for their season-opening series in Australia. 
He began the season on the disabled list, and rejoined the Dodgers for 
their home opener in April.[107] Kemp struggled defensively in center field 
during the first couple of months of the season, a problem that came to 
a head after a particular bad series for him against the New York Mets 
in mid-May. Manager Don Mattingly was openly critical of his outfield play 
following the series.[108] Immediately afterward, the Dodgers made Andre 
Ethier the starting center fielder, and informed Kemp that he would be 
moving to left field. However, he was kept out of the lineup for five straight 
games as he was learning the new position, and was vocally unhappy about 
it.[109] After playing in left for several weeks, he was moved to right 
field, a position he had not played regularly since 2009. He was more comfortable 
in right which led to the Dodgers moving Yasiel Puig to center field.[110] 
The last week of July, he hit five home runs in six games to win Player 
of the Week honors for the fifth time in his career.[111] He also won Player 
of the Month for September, when he hit .322 with nine homers and 25 RBI.[112] 
For the season, Kemp hit .287 with 25 homers and 89 RBI in 150 games.[1] 
On December 11, 2014, he was traded to the San Diego Padres along with 
Tim Federowicz and $32 million in cash for Joe Wieland, Yasmani Grandal, 
and Zach Eflin. The trade was not finalized until December 18 due to the 
Padres expressing some concerns over a physical which revealed Kemp had 
severe arthritis in both hips.[113] The Padres attempted to renegotiate 
the deal after the physical but the Dodgers refused, and the deal was consummated 
as originally conceived.[114] Kemp played his first game with the Padres 
during opening day on April 6, 2015, against his old team, the Dodgers. 
During that game, Kemp drove in the only 3 runs for the Padres, as the 
team lost to the Dodgers 6-3.[115] On August 14, 2015, on the road against 
the Colorado Rockies, Kemp became the first player in the Padres' 7,444-game 
history to hit for the cycle. In the first inning, he hit a 2-run home 
run to center, followed by a single and a double. He finished with a triple 
to center field in the top of the 9th inning, scoring Yangervis Solarte 
from first. He finished the night 4-for-5. On July 30, 2016, the Padres 
traded Kemp with cash considerations to the Atlanta Braves in exchange 
for Hector Olivera.[116] The Braves moved Kemp to left field,[117] a position 
he had started playing with the Dodgers in 2014.[118][119] On September 
16, 2016, in a game against the Washington Nationals, Kemp hit a double 
for the 1,500th hit of his career.[120] Kemp's nickname is "The Bison."[121] 
During the second major league game of Kemp's career, on May 29, 2006, 
he stole second base in the fourth inning, after which Atlanta Braves television 
announcer Don Sutton said he looked "like a big buffalo running around 
the bases." The observation was appropriate due to Kemp's imposing size 
– the Dodgers' roster lists him at 6' 4" tall and 225 pounds – and surprisingly 
fast foot-speed. The word "buffalo" was modified to "bison", by the commenter 
D4P on Jon Weisman's popular Dodgers blog, Dodger Thoughts,[122] as it 
is a more proper term for the North American mammal to which the moniker 
refers. It wasn't until the next day when the starting lineup did not include 
Kemp that baseball writer Eric Enders, also commenting in Dodger Thoughts 
added the capitalized article in front of the animal, completing the nickname, 
writing "So much for looking forward to watching The Bison tonight."[123] 
The nickname also refers to Kemp's Oklahoma roots. The bison is the official 
state animal of Oklahoma.[124] In 2008, an ex-girlfriend filed a restraining 
order against Kemp, claiming that she had been abused by him.[125] However, 
she later dropped the complaint and her representative stated that the 
restraining order "had nothing to do with domestic violence."[126] Kemp 
dated pop singer Rihanna for a time beginning November 2009.[127][128] 
Kemp is involved in charities for children, even creating a community initiative 
called Kemp's Kids hosted children from the Los Angeles area during several 
games at Dodger Stadium. Some of these children were from the Challenger
