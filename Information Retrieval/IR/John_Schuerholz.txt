John Schuerholz (/ˈʃɜːrhɒlts/; born October 1, 1940) is the president of 
the Atlanta Braves of the National League. Before joining Atlanta, he spent 
twenty-two years with the Kansas City Royals organization, including nine 
(1982 to 1990) as the club's general manager. Among the teams he has built 
are the 1985 Royals and 1995 Braves, both World Series champions. His teams 
have also won their division 15 times. He was the general manager with 
the Atlanta Braves from 1990 to 2007. In 2007 he was promoted to the post 
of club president. Schuerholz was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He is a 
graduate of the Baltimore City College High School, Towson University and 
Loyola University.[1] While at Towson, Schuerholz applied for officer candidate 
school and was rejected, as he was partially deaf.[2] Before his career 
in baseball, Schuerholz was a teacher at North Point Junior High in Baltimore.[1] 
Upon leaving his teaching job, he was drafted by the United States Army 
to serve in the Vietnam War. After entering Major League Baseball with 
the Baltimore Orioles, Schuerholz joined the United States Army Reserve.[2] 
He donated $250,000 to Towson in 1999. This money was used to upgrade the 
school's baseball facility, which was named after Schuerholz.[3] Schuerholz's 
son, Jonathan, was selected by Atlanta in the eighth round of the 2002 
MLB draft[4] and played in the minor leagues until 2007. Jonathan retired 
from baseball in August 2007 to go back to Auburn University to complete 
his business degree. The younger Schuerholz, who finished his six-year 
career in the minor leagues with a .223 batting average,[5] was named manager 
of the Rome Braves (Atlanta's Class-A minor league affiliate) in 2014.[6][7] 
After the season, Jonathan was reassigned to the Braves front office to 
serve as an assistant player-development director.[8] The Baltimore Orioles 
hired Schuerholz in 1966 as a result of a letter Schuerholz wrote to team 
owner Jerold Hoffberger. Schuerholz worked under Frank Cashen, Harry Dalton, 
and Lou Gorman. In 1969, Major League Baseball expanded to Kansas City. 
Gorman and Schuerholz left for the Royals. Schuerholz was named general 
manager of the Royals during the 1981 offseason, and became Major League 
Baseball's youngest general manager at the time. Schuerholz built a strong 
relationship with Royals owner Ewing Kauffman, but left the team as it 
began to struggle. He joined the Braves in 1990.[1] On October 11, 2007, 
Schuerholz resigned as the Atlanta Braves general manager, but was promoted 
to club president, replacing Terry McGuirk. Schuerholz's top assistant 
Frank Wren was named the general manager.[9] Schuerholz has sent many assistants 
to general manager positions around the league. The most recent is Dayton 
Moore, the former Director of Scouting and assistant GM was hired by the 
Kansas City Royals to replace Allard Baird. In 2006, Schuerholz published 
a book, Built To Win, which chronicled his tenure with the Braves and some 
of his most important moves as a GM.[10] Included in his book is a trade 
the Braves almost made with the Pirates in 1992. Had the deal gone through 
the Braves would have sent pitcher Alejandro Pena and outfielder Keith
