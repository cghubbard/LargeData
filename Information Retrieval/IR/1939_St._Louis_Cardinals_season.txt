The 1939 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 58th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and the 48th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
92–61 during the season and finished 2nd in the National League. Shortly 
after the end of the 1938 season, owner Sam Breadon appointed former reserve 
Cardinals outfielder Ray Blades as manager. He had managed many of the 
organization's top young players in Columbus, Ohio, and Rochester, New 
York. A feisty skipper, Blades guided the Cardinals back into the pennant 
race. The Cincinnati Reds took over first place on May 26 and never fell 
back. The Cards seized second place at midseason and played at a .708 clip 
in the final 65 games-including a 29–6 record at home the second half-but 
never could catch the Reds. The Redbirds made Cincinnati work down the 
stretch, though. They took two games from the Reds with the third of the 
three-game series washed out as a tie, and that pulled the Cards to only 
3 and a half games back. Twice the Cardinals drew a game closer in September. 
An old trade haunted the Cards: Paul Derringer, a former St. Louis farmhand, 
went 25–7 for the Reds. That record included a 5–3 victory in September 
that clinched the pennant for the Reds. The best offense in the league 
was at least partially responsible for the Cardinals' dramatic turn. They 
led the NL in runs and made the most of their speed to head the league 
in doubles and triples. Their .294 team batting average was 16 points higher 
than anyone else's. The trade that sent Dizzy Dean to the Chicago Cubs 
actually paid some dividens. Curt Davis, one of the two pitchers picked 
up in the deal, led the Redbirds' staff in almost every category. Clyde 
Shoun, the other ex-Cub, worked a team-high 51 games out of the bullpen. 
With rookie Mort Cooper winning 12 games and working more than 200 innings, 
the Cards pitchers posted the league's second-best ERA. [1] [2] [3] [4]
