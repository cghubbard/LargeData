The following are the baseball events of the year 1972 throughout the world. 
1972 was tainted by a players' strike over pension and salary arbitration. 
The strike erased the first week and a half of the season, and the Leagues 
decided to just excise the lost portion of the season with no makeups. 
As a result, an uneven number of games were cancelled for each team; some 
as few as six, some as many as nine. The lack of makeups of those games, 
even when they affected playoffs, led to the Boston Red Sox losing the 
American League East by half a game to the Detroit Tigers. 1972 marked 
the first year for the Texas Rangers, who had moved to Arlington from Washington, 
D.C. (where they played as the Washington Senators), after the 1971 season. 
There would be no baseball in D.C. until 2005. The team was one of the 
worst ever fielded by the franchise, losing 100 games for the first time 
since 1964. Manager Ted Williams hated living in the Dallas-Fort Worth 
area, and resigned at the end of the season. 1972 would mark the Kansas 
City Royals' final year at Kansas City Municipal Stadium, as the next year 
they would move to Royals Stadium (later named Kauffman Stadium) at the 
Truman Sports Complex in suburban Kansas City. The World Series was won 
by the Oakland Athletics, the first of three straight behind the bats of 
Reggie Jackson and Bert Campaneris, and the pitching cadre of Catfish Hunter, 
Rollie Fingers and Vida Blue. The year ended on a sad note when Roberto 
Clemente died in an airplane crash off the coast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, 
on New Year's Eve, while participating in aid efforts after the 1972 Nicaragua
