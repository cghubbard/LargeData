The President of the United States (POTUS)[7] is the elected head of state 
and head of government of the United States. The president directs the 
executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief 
of the United States Armed Forces. The President is considered to be one 
of the world's most powerful political figures, leading the world's only 
contemporary superpower.[8][9][10][11] The role includes being the commander-in-chief 
of the world's most expensive military with the second largest nuclear 
arsenal and leading the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP. 
The office of the president holds significant hard and soft power both 
in the United States and abroad. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests 
the executive power of the United States in the president. The power includes 
execution of federal law, alongside the responsibility of appointing federal 
executive, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers, and concluding 
treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the Senate. 
The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves, 
and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of Congress under extraordinary 
circumstances.[12] The president is largely responsible for dictating the 
legislative agenda of the party to which the president is enrolled. The 
president also directs the foreign and domestic policy of the United States.[13] 
Since the office of President was established in 1789, its power has grown 
substantially, as has the power of the Federal Government as a whole.[14] 
The president is indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral 
College to a four-year term, and is one of only two nationally elected 
federal officers, the other being the Vice President of the United States.[15] 
The Twenty-second Amendment (adopted in 1951) prohibits anyone from ever 
being elected to the presidency for a third term. It also prohibits a person 
from being elected to the presidency more than once if that person previously 
had served as president, or acting president, for more than two years of 
another person's term as president. In all, 43 individuals have served 
44 presidencies (counting Grover Cleveland's two non-consecutive terms 
separately) spanning 56 full four-year terms.[16] On January 20, 2009, 
Barack Obama became the 44th and current president. On November 6, 2012, 
he was re-elected. This second term ends at noon on January 20, 2017. At 
that time, Donald Trump, having won the 2016 presidential election, is 
scheduled to be inaugurated as the nation's 45th president. In 1776, the 
Thirteen Colonies, acting through the Second Continental Congress, declared 
political independence from Great Britain during the American Revolution. 
The new states, though independent of each other as nation states,[17] 
recognized the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against 
the British.[18] Desiring to avoid anything that remotely resembled a monarchy, 
Congress negotiated the Articles of Confederation to establish a weak alliance 
between the states.[17] As a central authority, Congress under the Articles 
was without any legislative power; it could make its own resolutions, determinations, 
and regulations, but not any laws, nor any taxes or local commercial regulations 
enforceable upon citizens.[18] This institutional design reflected the 
conception of how Americans believed the deposed British system of Crown 
and Parliament ought to have functioned with respect to the royal dominion: 
a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.[18] 
Out from under any monarchy, the states assigned some formerly royal prerogatives 
(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress, while severally 
lodging the rest within their own respective state governments. Only after 
all the states agreed to a resolution settling competing western land claims 
did the Articles take effect on March 1, 1781, when Maryland became the 
final state to ratify them. In 1783, the Treaty of Paris secured independence 
for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned 
toward their own internal affairs.[17] By 1786, Americans found their continental 
borders besieged and weak, their respective economies in crises as neighboring 
states agitated trade rivalries with one another, witnessed their hard 
currency pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their Mediterranean 
commerce preyed upon by North African pirates, and their foreign-financed 
Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.[17] Civil and political 
unrest loomed. Following the successful resolution of commercial and fishing 
disputes between Virginia and Maryland at the Mount Vernon Conference in 
1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set 
for September 1786 in Annapolis, Maryland, with an aim toward resolving 
further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the convention 
failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other 
states, the Annapolis delegates called for a convention to offer revisions 
to the Articles, to be held the next spring in Philadelphia. Prospects 
for the next convention appeared bleak until James Madison and Edmund Randolph 
succeeded in securing George Washington's attendance to Philadelphia as 
a delegate for Virginia.[17][19] When the Constitutional Convention convened 
in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (Rhode Island did not 
send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse 
set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches 
from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained 
a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by 
the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive 
council, and countered by a strong legislature.[17] New York offered the 
greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment 
power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite 
number of terms thereafter.[17] It was through the closed-door negotiations 
at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the U.S. Constitution emerged. 
The first power the Constitution confers upon the president is the veto. 
The Presentment Clause requires any bill passed by Congress to be presented 
to the president before it can become law. Once the legislation has been 
presented, the president has three options: In 1996, Congress attempted 
to enhance the president's veto power with the Line Item Veto Act. The 
legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law 
while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly 
any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited 
tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president 
then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its 
ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In Clinton v. City of 
New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled such a legislative 
alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional. Perhaps the most important 
of all presidential powers is the command of the United States Armed Forces 
as its commander-in-chief. While the power to declare war is constitutionally 
vested in Congress, the president has ultimate responsibility for direction 
and disposition of the military. The present-day operational command of 
the Armed Forces (belonging to the Department of Defense) is normally exercised 
through the Secretary of Defense, with assistance of the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the Combatant Commands, as outlined in the presidentially 
approved Unified Command Plan (UCP).[20][21][22] The framers of the Constitution 
took care to limit the president's powers regarding the military; Alexander 
Hamilton explains this in Federalist No. 69: The President is to be commander-in-chief 
of the army and navy of the United States. ... It would amount to nothing 
more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces 
... while that [the power] of the British king extends to the DECLARING 
of war and to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all [of] 
which ... would appertain to the legislature.[23] [Emphasis in the original.] 
Congress, pursuant to the War Powers Resolution, must authorize any troop 
deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on triggering 
mechanisms that have never been employed, rendering it ineffectual.[24] 
Additionally, Congress provides a check to presidential military power 
through its control over military spending and regulation. While historically 
presidents initiated the process for going to war,[25][26] critics have 
charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did 
not get official declarations, including Theodore Roosevelt's military 
move into Panama in 1903,[25] the Korean War,[25] the Vietnam War,[25] 
and the invasions of Grenada in 1983[27] and Panama in 1990.[28] Along 
with the armed forces, the president also directs U.S. foreign policy. 
Through the Department of State and the Department of Defense, the president 
is responsible for the protection of Americans abroad and of foreign nationals 
in the United States. The president decides whether to recognize new nations 
and new governments, and negotiates treaties with other nations, which 
become binding on the United States when approved by two-thirds vote of 
the Senate.[citation needed] Although presidents are not constitutionally 
provided with the power, they sometimes employ "executive agreements" in 
foreign relations. These agreements frequently regard administrative policy 
choices germane to executive power; for example, the extent to which either 
country presents an armed presence in a given area, how each country will 
enforce copyright treaties, or how each country will process foreign mail. 
However, the 20th century witnessed a vast expansion of the use of executive 
agreements, and critics have challenged the extent of that use as supplanting 
the treaty process and removing constitutionally prescribed checks and 
balances over the executive in foreign relations. Supporters counter that 
the agreements offer a pragmatic solution when the need for swift, secret, 
and/or concerted action arises.[citation needed] Suffice it to say that 
the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the 
United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed 
upon him are awesome indeed. The president is the head of the executive 
branch of the federal government and is constitutionally obligated to "take 
care that the laws be faithfully executed."[29] The executive branch has 
over four million employees, including members of the military.[30] Presidents 
make numerous executive branch appointments: an incoming president may 
make up to 6,000 before taking office and 8,000 more while serving. Ambassadors, 
members of the Cabinet, and other federal officers, are all appointed by 
a president with the "advice and consent" of a majority of the Senate. 
When the Senate is in recess for at least ten days, the president may make 
recess appointments.[31] Recess appointments are temporary and expire at 
the end of the next session of the Senate. The power of a president to 
fire executive officials has long been a contentious political issue. Generally, 
a president may remove purely executive officials at will.[32] However, 
Congress can curtail and constrain a president's authority to fire commissioners 
of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers 
by statute.[33] The president additionally possesses the ability to direct 
much of the executive branch through executive orders that are grounded 
in federal law or constitutionally granted executive power. Executive orders 
are reviewable by federal courts and can be superseded by federal legislation. 
To manage the growing federal bureaucracy, Presidents have gradually surrounded 
themselves with many layers of staff, who were eventually organized into 
the Executive Office of the President of the United States. Within the 
Executive Office, the President's innermost layer of aides (and their assistants) 
are located in the White House Office. The president also has the power 
to nominate federal judges, including members of the United States courts 
of appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States. However, these nominations 
require Senate confirmation. Securing Senate approval can provide a major 
obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward 
a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to U.S. district 
courts, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of senatorial 
courtesy. Presidents may also grant pardons and reprieves (Bill Clinton 
pardoned Patty Hearst on his last day in office), as is often done just 
before the end of a presidential term, but not without controversy.[34][35][36] 
Historically, two doctrines concerning executive power have developed that 
enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. 
The first is executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold 
from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the 
performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed privilege 
when Congress requested to see Chief Justice John Jay's notes from an unpopular 
treaty negotiation with Great Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution, 
or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. 
When Richard Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not 
turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the Watergate scandal, 
the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), 
that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting 
to avoid criminal prosecution. When President Bill Clinton attempted to 
use executive privilege regarding the Lewinsky scandal, the Supreme Court 
ruled in Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681 (1997), that the privilege also 
could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the legal precedent 
that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege 
has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed 
this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees, 
but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications 
that do not involve the president.[37] The state secrets privilege allows 
the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents 
from discovery in legal proceedings if such release would harm national 
security. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when 
Thomas Jefferson refused to release military documents in the treason trial 
of Aaron Burr and again in Totten v. United States 92 U.S. 105 (1876), 
when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.[38] 
However, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme 
Court until United States v. Reynolds 345 U.S. 1 (1953), where it was held 
to be a common law evidentiary privilege.[39] Before the September 11 attacks, 
use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.[40] Since 
2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier 
stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the 
suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the Ninth Circuit's 
ruling in Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.[39][41][42] Critics of the 
privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up 
illegal or embarrassing government actions.[43][44] The Constitution's 
Ineligibility Clause prevents the President (and all other executive officers) 
from simultaneously being a member of Congress. Therefore, the president 
cannot directly introduce legislative proposals for consideration in Congress. 
However, the president can take an indirect role in shaping legislation, 
especially if the president's political party has a majority in one or 
both houses of Congress. For example, the president or other officials 
of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or 
representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. The president 
can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally mandated, 
periodic reports to Congress. These reports may be either written or oral, 
but today are given as the State of the Union address, which often outlines 
the president's legislative proposals for the coming year. Additionally, 
the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by 
threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made. 
In the 20th century critics began charging that too many legislative and 
budgetary powers have slid into the hands of presidents that should belong 
to Congress. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a 
vast array of agencies that can issue regulations with little oversight 
from Congress. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a "virtual 
army of 'czars' – each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with 
spearheading major policy efforts for the White House."[45] Presidents 
have been criticized for making signing statements when signing congressional 
legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.[46] 
This practice has been criticized by the American Bar Association as unconstitutional.[47] 
Conservative commentator George Will wrote of an "increasingly swollen 
executive branch" and "the eclipse of Congress."[48] According to Article 
II, Section 3, Clause 2 of the Constitution, the president may convene 
either or both houses of Congress. If both houses cannot agree on a date 
of adjournment, the president may appoint a date for Congress to adjourn. 
As head of state, the president can fulfill traditions established by previous 
presidents. William Howard Taft started the tradition of throwing out the 
ceremonial first pitch in 1910 at Griffith Stadium, Washington, D.C., on 
the Washington Senators' Opening Day. Every president since Taft, except 
for Jimmy Carter, threw out at least one ceremonial first ball or pitch 
for Opening Day, the All-Star Game, or the World Series, usually with much 
fanfare.[49] The President of the United States has served as the honorary 
president of the Boy Scouts of America since the founding of the organization.[50] 
Other presidential traditions are associated with American holidays. Rutherford 
B. Hayes began in 1878 the first White House egg rolling for local children.[51] 
Beginning in 1947 during the Harry S. Truman administration, every Thanksgiving 
the president is presented with a live domestic turkey during the annual 
national thanksgiving turkey presentation held at the White House. Since 
1989, when the custom of "pardoning" the turkey was formalized by George 
H. W. Bush, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out 
the rest of its natural life.[52] Presidential traditions also involve 
the president's role as head of government. Many outgoing presidents since 
James Buchanan traditionally give advice to their successor during the 
presidential transition.[53] Ronald Reagan and his successors have also 
left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on Inauguration Day 
for the incoming president.[54] During a state visit by a foreign head 
of state, the president typically hosts a State Arrival Ceremony held on 
the South Lawn, a custom begun by John F. Kennedy in 1961.[55] This is 
followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the 
State Dining Room later in the evening.[56] The modern presidency holds 
the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that 
images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration 
public relations officials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic 
described the presidency as "propagandized leadership" which has a "mesmerizing 
power surrounding the office."[57] Administration public relations managers 
staged carefully crafted photo-ops of smiling presidents with smiling crowds 
for television cameras.[58] One critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy 
was described as carefully framed "in rich detail" which "drew on the power 
of myth" regarding the incident of PT 109[59] and wrote that Kennedy understood 
how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.[60] As a result, 
some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic 
expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to "drive the economy, 
vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the 
national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees."[61] 
Most of the nation's Founding Fathers expected the Congress, which was 
the first branch of government described in the Constitution, to be the 
dominant branch of government; they did not expect a strong executive.[62] 
However, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in 
claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful,[63][64] unchecked, 
unbalanced,[65] and "monarchist" in nature.[66] Critic Dana D. Nelson believes 
presidents over the past thirty years have worked towards "undivided presidential 
control of the executive branch and its agencies."[67] She criticizes proponents 
of the unitary executive for expanding "the many existing uncheckable executive 
powers – such as executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, 
national security directives and legislative signing statements – that 
already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy 
without aid, interference or consent from Congress."[67] Activist Bill 
Wilson opined that the expanded presidency was "the greatest threat ever 
to individual freedom and democratic rule."[68] Article II, Section 1, 
Clause 5 of the Constitution sets the following qualifications for holding 
the presidency: The Twelfth Amendment precludes anyone ineligible to being 
the president from becoming the vice president. A person who meets the 
above qualifications is still disqualified from holding the office of president 
under any of the following conditions: The modern presidential campaign 
begins before the primary elections, which the two major political parties 
use to clear the field of candidates before their national nominating conventions, 
where the most successful candidate is made the party's nominee for president. 
Typically, the party's presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential 
nominee, and this choice is rubber-stamped by the convention. The most 
common previous profession by U.S. presidents is lawyer.[71] Nominees participate 
in nationally televised debates, and while the debates are usually restricted 
to the Democratic and Republican nominees, third party candidates may be 
invited, such as Ross Perot in the 1992 debates. Nominees campaign across 
the country to explain their views, convince voters and solicit contributions. 
Much of the modern electoral process is concerned with winning swing states 
through frequent visits and mass media advertising drives. The president 
is elected indirectly. A number of electors, collectively known as the 
Electoral College, officially select the president. On Election Day, voters 
in each of the states and the District of Columbia cast ballots for these 
electors. Each state is allocated a number of electors, equal to the size 
of its delegation in both Houses of Congress combined. Generally, the ticket 
that wins the most votes in a state wins all of that state's electoral 
votes and thus has its slate of electors chosen to vote in the Electoral 
College. The winning slate of electors meet at its state's capital on the 
first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after 
the election, to vote. They then send a record of that vote to Congress. 
The vote of the electors is opened by the sitting vice president—acting 
in that role's capacity as President of the Senate—and read aloud to a 
joint session of the incoming Congress, which was elected at the same time 
as the president. Pursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the president's 
term of office begins at noon on January 20 of the year following the election. 
This date, known as Inauguration Day, marks the beginning of the four-year 
terms of both the president and the vice president. Before executing the 
powers of the office, a president is constitutionally required to take 
the presidential oath: I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully 
execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best 
of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United 
States.[72] Although not required, presidents have traditionally palmed 
a Bible while swearing the oath and have added, "So help me God!" to the 
end of the oath.[73] Further, although the oath may be administered by 
any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally 
sworn in by the Chief Justice of the United States. The term of office 
for president and vice president is four years. George Washington, the 
first president, set an unofficial precedent of serving only two terms, 
which subsequent presidents followed until 1940. Before Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
attempts at a third term were encouraged by supporters of Ulysses S. Grant 
and Theodore Roosevelt; neither of these attempts succeeded. In 1940, Franklin 
D. Roosevelt declined to seek a third term, but allowed his political party 
to "draft" him as its presidential candidate and was subsequently elected 
to a third term. In 1941, the United States entered World War II, leading 
voters to elect Roosevelt to a fourth term in 1944. Roosevelt died only 
82 days after taking office for the fourth term on 12 April 1945. After 
the war, and in response to Roosevelt being elected to third and fourth 
terms, the Twenty-second Amendment was adopted. The amendment bars anyone 
from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served 
more than half of another president's term. Harry S. Truman, president 
when this amendment was adopted, was exempted from its limitations and 
briefly sought a third (a second full) term before withdrawing from the 
1952 election. Since the amendment's adoption, four presidents have served 
two full terms: Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and 
George W. Bush. Barack Obama has been elected to a second term, and will 
complete his term on 20 January 2017, if he does not die or resign before 
that date. Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush sought a second term, but 
were defeated. Richard Nixon was elected to a second term, but resigned 
before completing it. Lyndon B. Johnson was the only president under the 
amendment to be eligible to serve more than two terms in total, having 
served for only fourteen months following John F. Kennedy's assassination. 
However, Johnson withdrew from the 1968 Democratic Primary, surprising 
many Americans. Gerald Ford sought a full term, after serving out the last 
two years and five months of Nixon's second term, but was not elected. 
Vacancies in the office of President may arise under several possible circumstances: 
death, resignation and removal from office. Article II, Section 4 of the 
Constitution allows the House of Representatives to impeach high federal 
officials, including the president, for "treason, bribery, or other high 
crimes and misdemeanors." Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 gives the Senate 
the power to remove impeached officials from office, given a two-thirds 
vote to convict. The House has thus far impeached two presidents: Andrew 
Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither was subsequently convicted 
by the Senate; however, Johnson was acquitted by just one vote. Under Section 
3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may transfer the presidential 
powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes acting president, 
by transmitting a statement to the Speaker of the House and the President 
pro tempore of the Senate stating the reasons for the transfer. The president 
resumes the discharge of the presidential powers and duties upon transmitting, 
to those two officials, a written declaration stating that resumption. 
This transfer of power may occur for any reason the president considers 
appropriate; in 2002 and again in 2007, President George W. Bush briefly 
transferred presidential authority to Vice President Dick Cheney. In both 
cases, this was done to accommodate a medical procedure which required 
Bush to be sedated; both times, Bush returned to duty later the same day.[74] 
Under Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the vice president, in conjunction 
with a majority of the Cabinet, may transfer the presidential powers and 
duties from the president to the vice president by transmitting a written 
declaration to the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of 
the Senate that the president is unable to discharge the presidential powers 
and duties. If this occurs, then the vice president will assume the presidential 
powers and duties as acting president; however, the president can declare 
that no such inability exists and resume the discharge of the presidential 
powers and duties. If the vice president and Cabinet contest this claim, 
it is up to Congress, which must meet within two days if not already in 
session, to decide the merit of the claim. The United States Constitution 
mentions the resignation of the president, but does not regulate its form 
or the conditions for its validity. Pursuant to federal law, the only valid 
evidence of the president's resignation is a written instrument to that 
effect, signed by the president and delivered to the office of the Secretary 
of State.[75] This has only occurred once, when Richard Nixon delivered 
a letter to Henry Kissinger to that effect. Section 1 of the Twenty-fifth 
Amendment states that the vice president becomes president upon the removal 
from office, death or resignation of the preceding president. The Presidential 
Succession Act of 1947 provides that if the offices of President and Vice 
President are each either vacant or are held by a disabled person, the 
next officer in the presidential line of succession, the Speaker of the 
House, becomes acting president. The line then extends to the President 
pro tempore of the Senate, followed by every member of the Cabinet. These 
persons must fulfill all eligibility requirements of the office of President 
to be eligible to become acting president; ineligible individuals are skipped. 
There has never been a special election for the office of President. Since 
2001, the president has earned a $400,000 annual salary, along with a $50,000 
annual expense account, a $100,000 nontaxable travel account, and $19,000 
for entertainment.[79][80] The most recent raise in salary was approved 
by Congress and President Bill Clinton in 1999 and went into effect in 
2001. The White House in Washington, D.C., serves as the official place 
of residence for the president. As well as access to the White House staff, 
facilities available to the president include medical care, recreation, 
housekeeping, and security services. The government pays for state dinners 
and other official functions, but the president pays for personal, family 
and guest dry cleaning and food; the high food bill often amazes new residents.[81] 
Naval Support Facility Thurmont, popularly known as Camp David, is a mountain-based 
military camp in Frederick County, Maryland, used as a country retreat 
and for high alert protection of the president and guests. Blair House, 
located next to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the White House 
Complex and Lafayette Park, is a complex of four connected townhouses exceeding 
70,000 square feet (6,500 m2) of floor space which serves as the president's 
official guest house and as a secondary residence for the president if 
needed.[82] For ground travel, the president uses the presidential state 
car, which is an armored limousine built on a heavily modified Cadillac-based 
chassis.[83] One of two identical Boeing VC-25 aircraft, which are extensively 
modified versions of Boeing 747-200B airliners, serve as long distance 
travel for the president and are referred to as Air Force One while the 
president is on board (although any U.S. Air Force aircraft the President 
is aboard is designated as "Air Force One" for the duration of the flight). 
In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes 
while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. 
Any civilian aircraft the President is aboard is designated Executive One 
for the flight.[84][85] The president also has access to a fleet of thirty-five 
U.S. Marine Corps helicopters of varying models, designated Marine One 
when the president is aboard any particular one in the fleet. Flights are 
typically handled with as many as five helicopters all flying together 
and frequently swapping positions as to disguise which helicopter the President 
is actually aboard to any would-be threats. The U.S. Secret Service is 
charged with protecting the sitting president and the first family. As 
part of their protection, presidents, first ladies, their children and 
other immediate family members, and other prominent persons and locations 
are assigned Secret Service codenames.[86] The use of such names was originally 
for security purposes and dates to a time when sensitive electronic communications 
were not routinely encrypted; today, the names simply serve for purposes 
of brevity, clarity, and tradition.[87] The White House Camp David Blair 
House State car Air Force One Marine One Beginning in 1959, all living 
former presidents were granted a pension, an office, and a staff. The pension 
has increased numerous times with Congressional approval. Retired presidents 
now receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's 
cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 each year in 2012.[88] Former presidents 
who served in Congress may also collect congressional pensions.[89] The 
Former Presidents Act, as amended, also provides former presidents with 
travel funds and franking privileges. Prior to 1997, all former presidents, 
their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret 
Service until the president's death.[90][91] In 1997, Congress passed legislation 
limiting secret service protection to no more than 10 years from the date 
a president leaves office.[92] On January 10, 2013, President Obama signed 
legislation reinstating lifetime secret service protection for him, George 
W. Bush, and all subsequent presidents.[93] A spouse who remarries is no 
longer eligible for secret service protection.[92] Some presidents have 
had significant careers after leaving office. Prominent examples include 
William Howard Taft's tenure as Chief Justice of the United States and 
Herbert Hoover's work on government reorganization after World War II. 
Grover Cleveland, whose bid for reelection failed in 1888, was elected 
president again four years later in 1892. Two former presidents served 
in Congress after leaving the White House: John Quincy Adams was elected 
to the House of Representatives, serving there for seventeen years, and 
Andrew Johnson returned to the Senate in 1875. John Tyler served in the 
provisional Congress of the Confederate States during the Civil War and 
was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives, but died before 
that body first met. Presidents may use their predecessors as emissaries 
to deliver private messages to other nations or as official representatives 
of the United States to state funerals and other important foreign events.[94][95] 
Richard Nixon made multiple foreign trips to countries including China 
and Russia and was lauded as an elder statesman.[96] Jimmy Carter has become 
a global human rights campaigner, international arbiter, and election monitor, 
as well as a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Bill Clinton has also 
worked as an informal ambassador, most recently in the negotiations that 
led to the release of two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, 
from North Korea. Clinton has also been active politically since his presidential 
term ended, working with his wife Hillary on her 2008 and 2016 presidential 
bids and President Obama on his reelection campaign. Living former U.S.

has created a repository known as a presidential library for preserving 
and making available his papers, records and other documents and materials. 
Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the National Archives 
and Records Administration (NARA); the initial funding for building and 
equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.[97] 
There are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. 
There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and 
private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, such as the Abraham 
Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by the State of Illinois, 
the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by Texas 
A&M University and the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum, 
which is run by the University of Texas at Austin. As many presidents live 
for many years after leaving office, several of them have personally overseen 
the building and opening of their own presidential libraries, some even 
making arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential 
libraries therefore contain the graves of the president they document, 
such as the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, 
California and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. 
The graves are viewable by the general public visiting these libraries.
