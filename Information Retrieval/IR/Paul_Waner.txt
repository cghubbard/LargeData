Paul Glee Waner (April 16, 1903 – August 29, 1965), nicknamed "Big Poison", 
was an American professional baseball right fielder. He played for the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, Brooklyn Dodgers, Boston Braves, and New York Yankees 
of Major League Baseball from 1926 to 1945. He won three National League 
(NL) batting titles and the NL Most Valuable Player Award while with the 
Pirates. He was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1952. Waner was 
born in Harrah, Oklahoma. He (3,152) and his younger brother, Lloyd (2,459), 
hold the career record for hits by brothers (5,611), outpacing the three 
Alou brothers (5,094): Felipe (2,101), Matty (1,777) and Jesús (1,216), 
and the three DiMaggio brothers (4,853): Joe (2,214), Dom (1,680) and Vince 
(959), among others. For most of the period from 1927 to 1940, Paul patrolled 
right field at Forbes Field while Lloyd covered the ground next to him 
in center field. On September 15, 1938, the brothers hit back-to-back home 
runs against Cliff Melton of the New York Giants.[1] Paul was known as 
"Big Poison" and Lloyd was known as "Little Poison." One story claims that 
their nicknames reflect a Brooklyn Dodgers fan's pronunciation of "Big 
Person" and "Little Person." In 1927, the season the brothers accumulated 
460 hits, the fan is said to have remarked, "Them Waners! It's always the 
little poison on thoid (third) and the big poison on foist (first)!" But 
given that Lloyd was actually taller, this story would seem somewhat incongruous. 
After playing the first 15 years of his career with the Pirates, Waner 
ended his career playing for the Dodgers (1941, 1943–1944), Boston Braves 
(1941–1942) and New York Yankees (1944–1945). Famous for his ability to 
hit while hung over, when Waner gave up drinking in 1938 at management's 
request, he hit only .280—the first of only two times that he failed to 
hit .300 as a Pirate. As Casey Stengel said in complimenting his base-running 
skills, "He had to be a very graceful player, because he could slide without 
breaking the bottle on his hip." Waner was also nearsighted, a fact that 
Pirate management only learned late in his career when he remarked that 
he had difficulty reading the ads posted on the outfield walls. Fitting 
him with glasses, however, only interfered with his hitting, as Waner now 
had to contend with a small spinning projectile rather than the fuzzy grapefruit-sized 
object he had been hitting before. Waner led the National League in batting 
on three occasions and accumulated over 3,000 hits during his 20-year baseball 
career. He collected 200 or more hits on eight occasions, was voted the 
NL's Most Valuable Player in 1927, and had a lifetime batting average of 
.333. He was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1952. He set the 
Major League record for consecutive games with an extra-base hit, with 
14 (June 6 through June 20, 1927); since then this feat has also been accomplished 
by Chipper Jones in 2006. Waner died in Sarasota, Florida in 1965 at age 
62. In 1999, he was ranked number 62 on The Sporting News' list of the 
100 Greatest Baseball Players,[2] and was nominated as a finalist for the 
Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Separate efforts by the Waner family 
and two longtime Pirates fans, who repeatedly petitioned Pirates then owner 
Kevin McClatchy to honor Waner by retiring his uniform number, were eventually 
successful.[3] The Pirates retired Waner's No. 11 in a ceremony before 
their game vs. the Astros on July 21, 2007, the anniversary of Paul's 1952 
Hall of Fame induction. A plaque has been placed in the interior of PNC 
Park to commemorate the retiring of Waner's jersey. Italics denotes active
