Lewis Everett Scott (November 19, 1892 – November 2, 1960), nicknamed "Deacon", 
was an American professional baseball player. A shortstop, Scott played 
in Major League Baseball for 12 seasons as a member of the Boston Red Sox, 
New York Yankees, Washington Senators, Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati 
Reds, from 1914 through 1926. Scott batted and threw right-handed. Scott 
served as captain of both the Red Sox and Yankees, who have become fierce 
rivals. He compiled a lifetime batting average of .249, hitting 20 home 
runs with 551 runs batted in in 1,654 games. He led American League shortstops 
in fielding percentage seven straight seasons (1916–22) and appeared in 
1,307 consecutive games from June 20, 1916, through May 6, 1925, setting 
a record later broken by Lou Gehrig. As of 2015[update], it is still the 
third-longest streak in history. After retiring from baseball, Scott became 
a successful professional bowler. He died in Fort Wayne, Indiana, at the 
age of 67. He was posthumously inducted into the Indiana Sports Hall of 
Fame and Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame. Scott was born in Bluffton, Indiana. 
He had two brothers and a sister. His father, Lewis, had moved to Bluffton 
from Warren, Indiana, shortly before Everett's birth. Lewis' brother, Frame, 
had been a baseball player when he was younger.[1] Scott attended Bluffton 
High School, where he played for the school's baseball and basketball teams.[2][3] 
He graduated in 1909.[2] Scott married his high school sweetheart, Gladys 
Watt, in 1912.[2][4] After graduating from Bluffton, Scott made his professional 
baseball debut in Minor League Baseball with the Kokomo Wild Cats of the 
Class D Northern State of Indiana League in 1909. He moved to the Fairmont 
Champions of the Class D Pennsylvania–West Virginia League for the remainder 
of the 1909 season. He began the 1910 season with Fairmont, and completed 
the season with Kokomo.[2] He joined the Youngstown Steelmen of the Class 
C Ohio–Pennsylvania League in 1911, and remained with them in 1912, when 
they played in the Class B Central League.[2] Jimmy McAleer, a native of 
Youngstown and minority owner of the Boston Red Sox of the American League 
(AL), noticed Scott playing for the Steelmen.[2] On McAleer's suggestion, 
the Red Sox purchased Scott from Youngstown after the 1912 season,[5] and 
optioned him to the St. Paul Saints of the Class AA American Association.[6] 
Towards the end of the 1913 season, the Red Sox recalled Scott.[7] Bill 
Phillips, manager of the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the outlaw Federal League, 
attempted to convince Scott to jump from the AL after the 1913 season by 
offering Scott a $4,000 contract. Scott remained with the Red Sox, signing 
a contract for $2,500 for the 1914 season.[2][8] Scott made his major league 
debut on April 14, 1914 for the Red Sox, and had a .239 batting average 
with strong fielding as a rookie. His batting average dropped to .201 in 
the 1915 season. The Red Sox won the AL pennant, and defeated the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the 1915 World Series. Scott had one hit in 18 at bats during 
the series.[2] On June 20, 1916, Scott began a consecutive games played 
streak.[9] Scott batted .232 in the 1916 season and led all AL shortstops 
in fielding percentage.[2][10] In the 1916 World Series, the Red Sox defeated 
the Brooklyn Robins. Scott had two hits in 16 at bats, and Wilbert Robinson 
of the Robins nicknamed Scott "Trolley Wire" due to his accurate throws.[2] 
After a contract dispute, when Scott refused a pay cut from the Red Sox,[11] 
Scott signed a contract for the 1918 season. He batted .241 in 1917,[2] 
while leading AL shortstops in fielding percentage and defensive games 
played,[12] but the Red Sox did not win the pennant. Scott batted .221 
in the 1918 season,[2] while leading AL shortstops in fielding percentage 
for the third consecutive season,[13] as the Red Sox won the 1918 World 
Series. In April 1919, Scott signed a three-year contract with the Red 
Sox.[2] Scott led AL shortstops in fielding percentage for the fourth consecutive 
season in 1919,[14] and batted .278, the highest average of his career.[2] 
Scott broke George Pinkney's MLB consecutive games played streak of 577 
on April 26, 1920.[15] He again led AL shortstops in fielding percentage.[16] 
The Red Sox named Scott team captain for the 1921 season, after the previous 
captain, Harry Hooper, was traded to the Chicago White Sox.[17] After the 
1921 season, the Red Sox traded Scott with Bullet Joe Bush and Sad Sam 
Jones to the New York Yankees for Rip Collins, Roger Peckinpaugh, Bill 
Piercy, Jack Quinn and $100,000 ($1,328,918 in current dollar terms). Del 
Pratt succeeded Scott as captain of the Red Sox.[18] With Peckinpaugh, 
the captain of the Yankees traded, Babe Ruth was named the new team captain. 
Ruth was suspended in May 1922 and Scott was named captain in Ruth's place.[19] 
Scott remained the Yankees' captain through 1925.[20] Scott played with 
the Yankees in the 1922 and 1923 World Series, winning in 1923. On May 
2, 1923, he was presented with a gold medal by Secretary of the Navy Edwin 
C. Denby in honor of his 1,000th consecutive game.[15][21] Scott broke 
Perry Lipe's professional baseball record for consecutive games played 
of 1,127 on September 14, 1923.[22][23] By the following offseason, manager 
Miller Huggins began to consider ending Scott's streak.[24] Huggins benched 
Scott on May 6, 1925 in favor of Pee Wee Wanninger, ending his record consecutive 
games played streak at 1,307.[9][25] The Washington Senators selected Scott 
off waivers from the New York Yankees in June 1925, paying the Yankees 
the waiver price of $4,000.[26] With the Senators, Scott served as Peckinpaugh's 
backup.[27] The Senators reached the 1925 World Series, but lost to the 
Pittsburgh Pirates; Scott did not appear in the series.[28] Though it was 
reported that Scott would retire to manage his business in Fort Wayne, 
Indiana,[29] the Chicago White Sox signed Scott in February 1926,[30] and 
the Cincinnati Reds selected him in July 1926. His final MLB appearance 
came with the Reds on July 27, 1926. Scott signed with the Baltimore Orioles 
of the International League for the 1927 season,[31] receiving his unconditionally 
release on August 4.[2] He signed with the Toledo Mud Hens of the American 
Association in August,[32] and played in 33 games for them.[2] Scott played 
with the Reading Keystones of the International League in 1928, batting 
.315. Scott returned to the Keystones in 1929, but received his release 
in July 1929 after 62 games,[2] due to the team's disappointing play.[33][34] 
Scott was an avid bowler, and he competed in ten-pin bowling events sanctioned 
by the American Bowling Congress.[35][36][37] He bowled against professional 
Hank Marino after his retirement from baseball.[38][39] Scott also owned 
bowling alleys in Fort Wayne.[40][41] Lou Gehrig, a former teammate of 
Scott's on the Yankees, surpassed Scott's record of consecutive games played 
in August 1933 in a game against the St. Louis Browns.[41] Gehrig's streak 
began in 1925, the same season Scott's streak ended.[42] Scott attended 
the game as a special guest of the Browns.[43] Scott died in Parkview Hospital 
in Fort Wayne, Indiana at age 67. He was posthumously inducted into the 
Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986[44] and the Boston Red Sox Hall of 
Fame in 2008.[45] The News-Sentinel named Scott the fourth-best athlete
