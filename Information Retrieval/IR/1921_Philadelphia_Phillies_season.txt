In 1921, the Phillies held spring training in Gainesville, Florida on the 
home field of the Florida Gators baseball team.[1] On July 16, 1921, Phillies 
players Jimmy Smith, Cy Williams, Frank Bruggy, Goldie Rapp, and Cliff 
Lee were arrested while leaving the ballpark in Philadelphia. Smith was 
detained and charged with assault, however the other four were allowed 
to leave after talking to police. While driving away from the park, two 
pedestrians walked in front of Bruggy's car (which all the Phillies were 
riding in), and the Phillies allegedly yelled at the pair. This allegedly 
instigated an argument and Smith was charged with hitting one of the pedestrians 
several times.[2] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Coaches Note:
