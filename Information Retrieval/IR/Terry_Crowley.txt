Terrence Michael Crowley (born February 16, 1947 in Staten Island, New 
York) is a former Major League Baseball player who serves as an organizational 
hitting instructor for the Baltimore Orioles. Crowley played for the Orioles 
from 1969 to 1973 and in 1976â€“82. He was a backup player who could play 
the outfield and first base. When the designated hitter rule was implemented, 
he was the first Oriole to fulfill this role. However, he was best known 
during his playing career for being a pinch hitter. As of the end of 2008, 
Crowley's 108 career pinch-hits is still the 13th-most all-time, tied with 
Denny Walling.[citation needed] Crowley has served as the hitting coach 
for the Baltimore Orioles from 1985 through 1988, the Minnesota Twins from 
1991 through 1998, and the Baltimore Orioles from 1999 through 2010. Crowley 
served as a roving hitting instructor in the Orioles organization in 2011.[1] 
He was an interim bullpen coach in 2011, following Mark Connor's resignation 
and the subsequent promotion of bullpen coach Rick Adair.[2] In 2014, Crowley 
worked with Oriole Chris Davis on his hitting.[3] Crowley attended Long 
Island University, Brooklyn Campus, before being drafted by the Orioles
