The 1991 Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball (MLB) won the World Series, 
the second time the Twins had won the World Series since moving to Minnesota 
in 1961. During the 1991 regular season the Twins had an MLB-leading 15-game 
win streak, which remains a club record. On June 18, 1991, the streak came 
to an end at the hands of the Baltimore Orioles but not before the Twins 
moved from fifth place to first, a lead they would not relinquish until 
winning baseball's championship. The Twins' winning streak of 1991 falls 
just five games short of the all-time American League (AL) record of 20 
consecutive regular season wins set by the Oakland Athletics in 2002. The 
Twins finished 95-67, first in the AL West, which represented a turnaround 
from 1990, when the team finished last in the division with a 74-88 record. 
They were the first team to go from a last-place finish to a World Series 
championship. They and the Atlanta Braves were the first teams to go from 
last place to a pennant. The Twins defeated the Braves in seven games in 
a Series which has been considered one of the best to have ever been played.[1][2][3][4] 
There was a considerable reshaping of the team in January and February, 
beginning when third baseman Gary Gaetti left as a free agent on January 
25 and signed with the California Angels. Less than 12 hours after Gaetti's 
departure, the Twins signed free agent Mike Pagliarulo from the New York 
Yankees as a new third baseman. Two more key free agent signings followed 
with designated hitter Chili Davis on January 30 and St. Paul native Jack 
Morris on February 5.[5] The July 1989 blockbuster trade that sent 1988 
AL Cy Young Award winner Frank Viola to the New York Mets in exchange for 
relief pitchers Rick Aguilera and David West and starter Kevin Tapani proved 
to be pivotal to the 1991 season. There were only seven players still on 
the roster from the 1987 World Championship team, none of them pitchers: 
Randy Bush, Greg Gagne, Dan Gladden, Kent Hrbek, Gene Larkin, Al Newman, 
and future Hall of Famer Kirby Puckett.[6] Into this framework, young stars 
were blended successfully, including Scott Leius to platoon with Pagliarulo 
at third, Shane Mack in right field, Scott Erickson, a 20-game winner with 
a 12-game winning streak,[7] and A.L. Rookie of the Year second baseman 
Chuck Knoblauch. 2,293,842 fans attended Twins games, the eighth highest 
total in the American League. The club moved spring training operations 
from Orlando's Tinker Field, where the franchise had trained since 1936, 
to the Lee County Sports Complex in Ft. Myers. For the second time in his 
career, Kirby Puckett had a six-hit game on May 23. This was an eleven-inning 
game; the previous time in 1987 was in nine innings. The highest paid player 
on the team was Jack Morris at $3,700,000; followed by Kirby Puckett at 
$3,166,667. Jack Morris, Kevin Tapani, and Scott Erickson were a solid, 
1-2-3 punch in the team's rotation. The fourth and fifth spots were less 
certain, with Allan Anderson, David West, and Mark Guthrie starting over 
10 games. Rick Aguilera was a solid closer, earning 42 saves. The regular 
lineup included Kent Hrbek at first base, rookie Chuck Knoblauch at second, 
Greg Gagne at shortstop, Brian Harper at catcher, and Kirby Puckett, Shane 
Mack, and Dan Gladden in the outfield. Mike Pagliarulo and Scott Leius 
platooned at third. Junior Ortiz was the backup catcher, and Al Newman 
was a reliable utility infielder. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]
